Advances in the technology and delivery of renal replacement
therapy (dialysis and transplantation) have revolutionised the
outcome of patients with progressive renal disease. However, the
paradox of this success has been to uncover a greatly increased risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD), up to 20 times that of the normal
population, a pattern similar to that seen in diabetes following the
discovery of insulin. However, the magnitude of the problem is
greater in renal disease and there is less agreement on the
mechanisms or evidence on which to base interventional strategies.
The importance of CVD in this population is reflected by recent
publications1-3 and a report from a specific task force of the US
National Kidney Foundation. The recognition that large scale
outcome studies are required has resulted in the initiation of several
studies that will report over the next few years. This review is a
personal view in which we will cover the background to CVD at
different stages in the natural history of progressive renal disease,
current treatments, unresolved problems, and ongoing studies


Why patients with renal disease are
different from the general population
To appreciate the problems and management of CVD in progressive
renal disease it is necessary to consider the key differences between
patients with renal disease and other patient groups. The first is the
course of renal disease (fig 1). Patients with progressive renal
disease suffer a period of deteriorating renal function, over months
to many years (depending on the underlying disease) and leading
ultimately to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in a proportion of
patients. Most patients with ESRD (around 100 per million
population per annum) currently enter renal replacement therapy
programmes involving either peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis.
Thereafter, approximately one third will be considered for renal
transplantation and, over a period of years, the majority of these
will proceed to have a successful cadaveric …
