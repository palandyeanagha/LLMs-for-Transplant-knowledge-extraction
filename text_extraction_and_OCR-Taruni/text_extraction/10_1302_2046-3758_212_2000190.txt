Objectives
The period of post-operative treatment before surgical wounds are completely closed 
remains a key window, during which one can apply new technologies that can minimise 
complications. One such technology is the use of negative pressure wound therapy to 
manage and accelerate healing of the closed incisional wound (incisional NPWT). 
Methods
We undertook a literature review of this emerging indication to identify evidence within 
orthopaedic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Literature that supports our current 
understanding of the mechanisms of action was also reviewed in detail. 
Results
A total of 33 publications were identified, including nine clinical study reports from 
orthopaedic surgery; four from cardiothoracic surgery and 12 from studies in abdominal, 
plastic and vascular disciplines. Most papers (26 of 33) had been published within the past 
three years. Thus far two randomised controlled trials – one in orthopaedic and one in 
cardiothoracic surgery – show evidence of reduced incidence of wound healing complications 
after between three and five days of post-operative NPWT of two- and four-fold, respectively. 
Investigations show that reduction in haematoma and seroma, accelerated wound healing 
and increased clearance of oedema are significant mechanisms of action. 
Conclusions
There is a rapidly emerging literature on the effect of NPWT on the closed incision. Initiated 
and confirmed first with a randomised controlled trial in orthopaedic trauma surgery, studies 
in abdominal, plastic and vascular surgery with high rates of complications have been 
reported recently. The evidence from single-use NPWT devices is accumulating. There are no 
large randomised studies yet in reconstructive joint replacement.

surgeons. Since its commercial introduction more than
20 years ago,1,2 NPWT has transformed the management
of complex open wounds such that it is now the standard
approach in many institutions. There is a growing evi￾dence base of randomised and comparative cohort stud￾ies of its use in the management of open fractures,3,4
open complex wounds following failures of arthro￾plasty,5,6 or spinal surgery.7
 There is also an extensive lit￾erature on the use of NPWT in chronic wound healing
and in reconstructive surgery.8-11 What may be less famil￾iar is the emerging evidence base for the use of NPWT on
the closed incision.
Although at first sight it may appear counterintuitive,
NPWT is beginning to be used as a preventative tool in
reducing the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and
dehiscence of the closed incision. The purpose of this arti￾cle is to review the current status of the literature on the use
of NPWT on closed incisions in orthopaedic surgery and
evaluate the status of ‘incisional NPWT’ in other surgical
disciplines. Additionally we appraise the understanding
about possible mechanisms of action. In a future article we
plan to assess the evidence for identifying those patients at
greatest risk of SSI in orthopaedic procedures and review
the status of guidelines to target certain patient groups
with NPWT as a preventative technology, and discuss the
economic implications for such an approach.
Materials and Methods
Review of existing evidence on incisional NPWT. The con￾cept of applying negative pressure to a closed incision
began to be explored in the early years following com￾mercial availability of NPWT. Webb12 alluded to studies of
weeping surgical wounds treated with -50 mmHg nega￾tive pressure as early as 2002, but the first peer-reviewed
reports did not appear until 2006.13,14 Negative pressure
was applied through standard open-cell polyurethane
foam to incisions that were intrinsically at high risk of
complication. Unusually for an emerging indication, the
first published report of the use of negative pressure on
closed incisions was a randomised controlled study.
Stannard et al13 studied patients after high-energy ortho￾paedic trauma and enrolled 88 patients in two studies
between 2001 and 2003, with results published in June
2006. The authors used a traditional NPWT device (VAC;
KCI Inc., San Antonio, Texas) set at -125 mmHg. Their
paper reported the interim results from two randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of NPWT on draining
haematomas and calcaneus, pilon, and tibial plateau frac￾tures.13 In both studies wound drainage ceased statisti￾cally significantly earlier in the wounds treated with
NPWT, but there were no statistically significant
differences in the incidence of dehiscence or infection.
Gomoll et al14 also described this technique for high-risk
incisions in December of the same year. They also used a
traditional NPWT device set at -75 mmHg in high-risk
obese patients operated on for fracture fixation and total
hip reconstruction.14 Using “Incisional VAC” for a mean of
three days, they experienced no cases of wound break￾down in 35 high-risk patients.
Literature search on incisional NPWT. In order to estab￾lish the extent of the subsequent literature on the use of
NPWT for closed incisions, a systematic search was con￾ducted within the PubMed database using the terms:
“Negative Pressure Wound Therapy OR Topical Negative
Pressure OR Vacuum Assisted Closure” (n = 2238) AND
either “closed wound” (n = 172), “incision” (n = 44),
“incisional” (n = 33), “well wound therapy” (n = 240)
OR “prevent” (n = 86). The database was last searched
on 3 June 2013. No exclusions were placed on language
or publication date. Abstracts were reviewed by an
author (RM) and any relevant articles were obtained.
Additional articles cited in these papers were also
retrieved. A total of 33 unique papers were recovered
specifically discussing the application of NPWT to closed
incisions. The retrieved articles were grouped according
to the main indication and subject. There were nine
papers from orthopaedic surgery (Table I),13-21 four deal￾ing with cardiothoracic surgery (Table II)22-25 and
12 studies from abdominal, plastic and vascular indica￾tions (Table III).26-37 There were also four reviews report￾ing on mixed cases (Table IV)38-41 and four in vitro or
animal studies investigating mechanisms of action
(Table V).42-45 The rate of publications is increasing, with
the majority of articles published in the last three years.
NPWT on closed orthopaedic incisions. Table I summarises
the nine papers in the literature on the use of incisional NPWT
in orthopaedic surgery. Further to the original 2006 reports
from Stannard et al13 and Gomoll et al,14 Reddix et al15,16 pub￾lished two evaluations in high-BMI patients undergoing
repair of acetabular fracture using traditional NPWT devices
set at -75 mmHg for up to three days on the closed incision. In
the later series16 the incidence of infection and dehiscence
reduced approximately six-fold from 6% to 1% and from 3%
to 0.5%, respectively, when compared against historical cases
before the introduction of incisional NPWT.
In primary arthroplasty a randomised study in knee
replacement using traditional NPWT on closed incisions
versus a dry gauze dressing did not show any significant
reduction in infection (2.8% vs 4.8% for NPWT patients)
or time to achieve a dry wound (4.1 days vs 4.3 days for
NPWT patients), but the investigation was terminated
early due to excessive skin blisters and the full number of
patients were not recruited.17 The formation of skin blis￾ters is a familiar occurrence in orthopaedic surgery when
adhesive dressings are used on tissue that will undergo
swelling due to oedema.46 Blisters are significant as they
may provide a nidus for infection. A number of articles
describing incisional NPWT report the use of non￾adherent dressings to prevent the excoriating action of
polyurethane foam on unprotected tissue.14,15 Purpose￾designed single-use NPWT devices such as PICOTM (Smith
& Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom) or PrevenaTM (KCI,

NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE SURGICAL INCISION IN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY 278

San Antonio, Texas) incorporate features to address these
issues through the use of different wound contact materi￾als, but there are as yet no published reports that verify
such success in substantial numbers of arthroplasty
patients.38,47 However, effects of NPWT are detectable in
primary arthroplasty incisions. A statistically significant
lower volume of seroma was found using ultrasound
imaging in hip replacement patients treated with a sin￾gle-use incisional NPWT device set at -125 mmHg (Pre￾vena; KCI Inc.) for five days versus a conventional dry
dressing.18 The mean size of seroma was 1.97 mL with
NPWT compared with 5.08 mL (p = 0.021). The
randomised study only consisted of 19 normal-risk
patients, so it is unsurprising that there was no differ￾ence in the incidence of infection or dehiscence. Pro￾longed post-operative drainage is already known to be a
risk factor for SSI and a recent paper from Hansen et al21
reports their institutional use of NPWT applied at post￾operative day 3 or 4 in cases where there is prolonged
drainage in closed wounds (2% of total). Overall 76% of
109 patients treated in this way healed with no further
problems. This is a variant of a strategy to select high-risk
patients pre-operatively and thereby limit those patients
needing NPWT.

NPWT for closed incisions continues to expand its use
in traumatic injury, particularly in the lower extremity
where the incidence of post-operative infection is much
greater than in primary arthroplasty.19,20 Following on
the interim report on 44 patients that appeared in 2006,13
Stannard et al20 went on to published the results of the
full randomised study of incisional NPWT applied to high￾energy fractures. A total of 263 lower extremity fractures
were evaluated, with 122 managed with standard care
and 141 with incisional NPWT (mean duration 2.5 days).
The authors found a statistically significant reduction in
the rate of deep infection (19.0% vs 10.0%; p = 0.049)
and dehiscence (16.5% vs 8.6%; p = 0.044).20
In summary, good evidence exists for incisional NPWT
in orthopaedic surgery where comorbidities and inci￾dences of infection are known to be significant. The evi￾dence is less persuasive for reduction in infections and
dehiscence in uncomplicated primary joint replacement
and further studies are needed.
NPWT on closed cardiothoracic incisions. The risk of
post-operative sternal wound infection in open cardio￾thoracic surgery has been widely studied as the mortality
associated with deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) is
substantial. In a typical survey as many as 33% of patients
died within a year of the occurrence of a DSWI.48 The pos￾sibility of using incisional NPWT to reduce the incidence
of DSWI was first proposed by Atkins et al22 (Table II), who
also investigated perfusion in order to elucidate potential
mechanisms.23 Using traditional devices with thin strips
of silver-impregnated polyurethane foam at -125 mmHg,
a series of 57 high-risk cases were recorded without inci￾dence of infection.22 A small case series of ten high-risk
patients was reported using a single-use NPWT device,
again with no incidences of infection.24
The calculation of risk for post-operative wound infec￾tion has been the subject of extensive publication in car￾diothoracic surgery. The scoring system devised by
Fowler et al,49 who used the results from 300 000 patients
in the Society for Thoracic Surgeons database who under￾went coronary artery bypass graft, is widely used. Pre￾operative factors include age, obesity and diabetes, but
risks based on the intra-operative events are also consid￾ered, such as the use of internal thoracic arteries for the
grafts.49 In a recent randomised clinical study of standard
care versus single-use NPWT device (Prevena; KCI) in
150 evaluable high-risk patients (mean age 68 years,
mean BMI 37 kg/m2, diabetes in 54%), the overall rate of
sternal wound infection was reduced from 16% to 4%
(p = 0.027) after five to six days of prophylactic NPWT.25
NPWT on closed abdominal, plastic and vascular
incisions. Interest in incisional NPWT has also been evi￾dent among general, plastic and vascular surgeons
(Table III). In abdominal surgery such as incisional hernia
repair, the use of traditional NPWT devices has shown
some promise in difficult abdominal closures under
tension using polyurethane foam at either -75 mmHg
or -125 mmHg,26-29 including difficult high-risk abdom￾inal oncology patients.30 However, one comparative

NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE SURGICAL INCISION IN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY 280
VOL. 2, No. 12, DECEMBER 2013
cohort study saw no effects in ventral hernia closures.31
Donor sites for large free flaps often present issues with
infection and dehiscence, and a recent comparative
cohort analysis (42 standard treatment vs 52 NPWT) sug￾gested that traditional NPWT with foam at -175 mmHg
over ten to 14 days may be helpful in reducing failure
of the closed donor site incision (12% vs 5.8%), but the
effect not did not reach significance.32 A randomised
controlled trial of lower extremity ulcers treated with
surgery and closed primarily (37 standard treatment vs
44 traditional NPWT over three days) reported a lower
rate of infection (13.5% vs 6.8%) and a slightly higher
rate of dehiscence with NPWT (29.7% vs 36.4%), but
neither difference was statistically significant.37 The
population was high-risk, including many patients
with diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, but
there was no clear effect of NPWT. It is perhaps instruc￾tive to reflect on the fact that the first study in the field
of incisional NPWT was the interim report of the ran￾domised trial by Stannard et al13 in just 44 subjects,
which also found no statistically significant effect on
infection and dehiscence. It was not until the full study
on 249 subjects was published that statistically signifi￾cant effects were shown.20
Closed incisions following open vascular surgery for
the lower extremity also have a high incidence of compli￾cations.50 Incisional NPWT is being explored to see if the
rate of infections or dehiscence can be reduced by pre￾ventative application of NPWT.34 In a comparative cohort
analysis one group reported a good effect of single-use
NPWT (Prevena; KCI) on closures for femoral vascular pro￾cedures.34 Other procedures receiving exploration for
incisional NPWT include scar revision35 and inguinal
lymph node dissection.36
Other publications – mixed cases and reviews. The remain￾ing publications at present showing clinical cases of incisional
NPWT are all non-comparative in nature (Table IV), covering
traditional NPWT39 (VAC; KCI Inc.), single-use NPWT with
foam40 (Prevena; KCI Inc.) and single-use canister-less NPWT
(PICO; Smith & Nephew).38,41
Mechanisms of action. The scientific understanding of
the mechanisms of action of NPWT on open wounds has
grown steadily since the first descriptions of work in
pigs.1,51 Initial focus was on the stimulation of blood flow,
increased growth of granulation tissue and reduction in
bioburden. With respect to any effects on closed incisions
it is perhaps only the action of NPWT on perfusion that is
of immediate relevance.

Tissue perfusion effects. Following the initial animal
studies showing a stimulation of relative perfusion as
assessed by laser Doppler needle probes in the tissue sur￾rounding a full-thickness excision,1
 subsequent research
showed a pattern whereby NPWT caused a relative hypo￾perfusion close to the wound edge (0.5 cm), whereas an
increase in perfusion was only observed when the laser
Doppler probes were inserted about 2.5 cm away from
the wound edge.52-54 Independent evidence for effects
on tissue perfusion in the (stretched) zone surrounding
an open wound were obtained using direct video micros￾copy.55 It is possible that the establishment of adjacent
hypo- and hyper-perfused tissue zones may enhance
angiogenesis and evidence for such effects was recently
described in a diabetic mouse model in open wounds, in
which the highest concentrations of VEGF were detected
in areas of relative hypoxia at the foam-wound edge inter￾face.56 Using alternative surface-probe Laser Doppler
techniques, others have demonstrated significant
increases in relative perfusion in intact skin in healthy vol￾unteers.57 The level of stimulation continued to increase
up to -500 mmHg; a pressure at which all effects on the
stimulation of granulation tissue in open wounds on pigs
have vanished.51 Such perfusion effects might be relevant
to healing of incisional wounds but the differences in
techniques, the location and type of probes leaves some
room for doubt as to whether one or the other is relevant.
Indeed it has been claimed that the stimulation of perfu￾sion as measured by Laser Doppler needle probes is an
artefact due to compression of capillary beds.58 However,
in a recent study changes in relative perfusion around
full-thickness wounds in pigs were compared with three
different methods.59 Both Laser Doppler filament probes
and thermo-dilution probes gave similar patterns: hypo￾perfusion at the edge of the wound and hyper-perfusion
further away, validating the earlier findings.52-54 In con￾trast, a surface-mounted perfusion sensor (O2C Device;
LEA Medizintechnik, Giessen, Germany) showed small
increases close to and away from the wound edge con￾firming the principle, if not the magnitude, of the earlier
studies in volunteers.57,59 An abstract of a preliminary
study with the O2C device, again on healthy volunteers,
also showed some increase in perfusion upon application
of a single-use NPWT device.60
Notwithstanding the above discussion, it has been
known for some time that perfusion stimulation on appli￾cation of NPWT is a temporary phenomenon.1
 In these ani￾mal studies the perfusion stimulation decays after
20 minutes, although it reappears if there is at least a two￾minute return to atmospheric pressure1
 – hence so-called
intermittent NPWT. In open wounds intermittent NPWT
stimulates more granulation tissue than continuous
NPWT, although it is less frequently used in clinical practice
as the intermittent feature can be painful.61 More recent
NPWT devices have variable settings so that negative pres￾sure cycles from high to low but not to atmospheric levels,
which may avoid issues with pain. At present all publica￾tions describing incisional NPWT have used continuous
negative pressure and no studies have appeared using
intermittent or variable intermittent NPWT on closed inci￾sions. Four articles that deal specifically with investigations
into the mechanisms of action of incisional NPWT are sum￾marised in Table V. At present there have been no publica￾tions that have reported what happens to perfusion
adjacent to closed incisions treated with NPWT.
Lateral tension and wound strength. The function of
sutures or other surgical closures is to bring the wound
edges together and to reduce lateral tension that causes
the wound to gape. Granulation tissue forms where the
wound gapes and this will form scarring in the healed
incision. Reductions in lateral tension across a closed inci￾sion have been demonstrated under constant NPWT with
computer modelling and in vitro measurements.42 There
is similar data that non-NPWT mechanical forces can
stress-shield closed incisions and reduces scarring.62
There is also evidence from animal studies that the break￾ing strength of wounds is increased through the applica￾tion of continuous NPWT to closed incisions.43,44
Effects on oedema. Although it was not investigated in
the early animal studies there is wide agreement, based in
a large measure on clinical experience, that elimination of
tissue oedema is a critical mechanism of NPWT action on
open wounds.1,2,12 Surprisingly there are only a handful of
studies that have directly measured this effect. Reduction
in oedema was inferred from a study in patients with
bilateral hand burns, in which increased perfusion was
observed in hands subjected to NPWT.63 In a porcine
model of a septic open abdomen, wet/dry weight compar￾isons showed that NPWT-treated pigs had less tissue
oedema than those treated by passive drainage.64 High￾frequency ultrasound has been used to quantify reduction
of oedema in the peri-wound tissue in a small group of
pressure ulcer patients on commencement of NPWT.65
While no direct quantification of oedema reduction has
been reported for closed incisions, a recent study has
reported data that argue strongly for an effect of incisional
NPWT in increasing the activity of lymphatic drainage in
the deep tissue treated with NPWT.45 Radiolabel micro￾spheres were cleared to lymph nodes more rapidly from
tissue beneath incisions treated with NPWT than from con￾trol incisions dressed conventionally.
Reduction in haematoma and seroma. Collections of
blood and serum in sub-incisional tissues create dead
spaces that may predispose towards infection. Two ani￾mal studies have independently shown reductions in
haematoma volume under incisional NPWT20,43 and this
has also been demonstrated clinically for seroma in a
small randomised controlled trial.18
In summary, the evidence supports the hypothesis that
reduction of lateral tension and haematoma or seroma,
coupled with an acceleration of the elimination of tissue
oedema, are the main mechanisms of action of incisional

NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE SURGICAL INCISION IN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY 282

NPWT. Together these mechanisms are able to improve
the speed, strength and quality of incisional wound heal￾ing, thus minimising the failures of healing that lead to
infection and/or dehiscence. It remains possible that some
redistribution of blood flow around closed incisions could
supplement these mechanisms. In fact these attributes are
reminiscent of the fourth set of experiments in the work by
Morykwas et al,1
 in which survival of random pattern flaps
was improved through application of NPWT to the intact
skin. If the skin around a closed incision, particularly
where undermining is involved, can be compared to a ran￾dom pattern flap, then these early experiments provide
support for the emerging field of incisional NPWT.
Recently, a significant clinical study on the effect of NPWT
on skin grafted free muscle flaps has been published.66 In
this investigation 15 patients were randomised to receive
NPWT at -125 mmHg as a post-operative dressing and
15 control patients received paraffin gauze in the absence
of NPWT. Taking biopsies before ischaemia (when the flap
was detached) and at five days after implantation, it was
demonstrated that NPWT reduced the ischaemia￾reperfusion inflammatory and oedema response.66 It
seems reasonable that much of the same biology will be
relevant to closed incisions. What is not yet clear is how
individual patient risk factors such as age or obesity are
influenced by the mechanisms of incisional NPWT.
Level of negative pressure and other variables. Despite
the relatively good understanding of the mechanisms
through which incisional NPWT might have an effect, there
is surprisingly little information on the optimum negative
pressure for clinical use. Tables I to V show that a range of
pressure levels have been used with traditional NPWT
devices (with -75 mmHg14-16 and -125 mmHg13,40 being
the most frequently used) without any obvious benefits in
clinical efficacy one way or the other. There have been no
published studies that have investigated levels of pressure
on desirable endpoints such as reduction of haematoma or
seroma, reduction of oedema, increase in wound strength
or reduction in complications. The emergence of single￾use devices with one fixed pressure setting perhaps
reduces the likelihood that such studies might be per￾formed.25,41 In the study of NPWT on free flaps discussed
above, tissue pressure was monitored at two locations: at
the interface between the flap and the device (white PVA
foam) and deeper at the level of the vascular anastomo￾sis.66 Positive, not negative, pressure at the surface of the
flap was detected, with little difference seen in the deeper
tissue: +8 mmHg to +12 mmHg when NPWT was varied
from -50 mmHg to -150 mmHg, respectively. This is similar
to the situation with NPWT for open wounds where the
accumulation of evidence suggests the efficacy of negative
pressure has a broad range between -50 mmHg and -150
mmHg.9
 In open wounds only the extremes of NPWT have
been explored with -25 mmHg and -500 mmHg having
been shown not to stimulate granulation tissue formation
in animals.51 No similar studies have been reported in
closed incisions.
Additional variables concern the construction of the inci￾sional NPWT device. There is a general consensus that
intact skin should not be exposed to polyurethane foam,
but there is no consensus on the optimum area of tissue
that should be subjected to NPWT, with traditional devices
using either thin strips14,22 or treatment of wider
zones.26,43 With evidence that the reduction of tissue
oedema has significance, treatment of a wider area than
just the immediate incision may be desirable. The material
for delivery of NPWT is also variable: the predominant use
has been of polyurethane foam, although a perforated
adhesive silicone tissue contact device is now commer￾cially available.38,41 The studies on free flaps discussed
above that show similarity in their physiology to closed
incisions were conducted with PVA “White foam”.66,67 A
study in pigs used gauze pads at -125 mmHg and showed
reduction in haematoma, improved wound strength and
improved visual appearance.43 It seems reasonable to con￾clude that negative pressure between -50 mmHg to -150
mmHg applied to the zone of tissue surrounding the inci￾sion is the principle component of the effect, although
much scope remains for investigation.
Conclusions
In its ten-year gestation, incisional NPWT has developed so
that there are now reasonable grounds for confidence that
this approach is widely applicable to a range of indications.
There is RCT evidence for reduction in dehiscence and
infection in orthopaedic trauma20 and sternal incisions.25
The rate of publication within the field is growing rapidly.
There are gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of
action. It seems likely that there are effects on resolving
post-operative oedema through effects on lymph
drainage45; it seems likely that wound breaking strength is
regained more rapidly43 and that haematoma and seroma
are reduced18,43,45 but we have little idea of precise mech￾anisms. Effects on perfusion outside of reduced oedema
are still in the balance.57,59 There are insufficient data yet to
identify optimum levels of negative pressure. Neverthe￾less, the availability of single-use NPWT devices24,25,38,41
means that costs of therapy are now such that exciting
opportunities for building clinical evidence in large ran￾domised studies are a prospect over the coming years.
