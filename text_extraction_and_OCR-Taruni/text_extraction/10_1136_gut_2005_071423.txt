Background: We report our experience with management of patients with Budd Chiari syndrome over the
past two decades. In 1996 we described a novel approach involving recanalisation of hepatic veins by
combined percutaneous and transvenous approaches. This was incorporated into an algorithm published
in 1999 in which our preferred treatment for all cases of Budd Chiari syndrome with short segment
occlusion or stenosis of the hepatic veins involves recanalisation of the hepatic veins by transvenous or
combined percutaneous-transvenous approaches. In symptomatic Budd Chiari syndrome where
recanalisation is not possible, we perform transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) because
TIPS decompresses the portal circulation directly in an adjustable way. In this series of patients with Budd
Chiari syndrome treated with radiological interventions alone, we assess their medium term outcome using
two independent objective prognostic indices.
Methods: We retrospectively studied 61 patients with non-malignant Budd Chiari syndrome treated by
radiological intervention alone in our centre.
Results: Actuarial survival for the entire cohort at one year and five years was 94% and 87%, respectively.
Survival of our patients with mild disease (according to the Murad classification) was 100% at one year
and at five years, with intermediate disease severity 94% at one year and 86% at five years, and with
severe disease 85% at one year and 77% at five years.
Conclusion: Management of Budd Chiari syndrome by interventional radiology resulted in excellent
medium term survival for patients in all categories of disease severity.
T
he wide variation in the management of Budd Chiari
syndrome between centres could partly be explained by
the lack of controlled clinical trials for this disease.1 The
prognostic index scores derived from and validated in
patients with Budd Chiari syndrome permit objective assess￾ment of disease severity and can be used to analyse efficacy of
treatment.2 3 Of patients with Budd Chiari syndrome treated
by medical treatment alone or by surgical portosystemic
shunts, those with more severe disease, as reflected by higher
prognostic index scores at presentation, had a significantly
poorer survival compared with those with less severe
disease.2 3
We have previously reported our early results of hepatic
vein recanalisation in Budd Chiari syndrome via interven￾tional radiological methods, including balloon dilatation and
hepatic vein stenting.4 5 We published an algorithm of the
management of Budd Chiari syndrome emphasising the role
of hepatic vein recanalisation and transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS).6 We hereby report the medium
term outcome in patients with Budd Chiari syndrome who
were treated by interventional radiology alone, applying
recently published prognostic indices to objectively quantify
disease severity at presentation.
METHODS
Study population and details of therapeutic
intervention
We conducted a retrospective study of hospital records of
patients with Budd Chiari syndrome managed in the Liver
Unit in our hospital from 1984 to March 2004. In patients
suspected of having Budd Chiari syndrome by clinical
features or liver biopsy, hepatic venous outflow obstruction
was confirmed by imaging tests (Doppler ultrasound,
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan,
or hepatic venogram). Of 115 patients with Budd Chiari
syndrome seen during the study period, three with malig￾nancy obstructing hepatic venous outflow were excluded.
We further excluded 44 patients treated by modalities
other than interventional radiology alone from the analysis.
These 44 patients were treated by mesocaval shunt surgery
(nine), mesoatrial shunt surgery (two), liver transplantation
(11), mesocaval shunt surgery followed by percutaneous
angioplasty of stenosed/thrombosed shunt or TIPS or hepatic
vein recanalisation (seven), mesocaval shunt surgery after
failed hepatic vein recanalisation (one), liver transplantation
followed by TIPS (one), and medical treatment only (13),
which consisted of anticoagulation, diuretics, and paracent￾esis as well as treatment of complications and the underlying
cause. Case records of seven patients could not be traced.
Thus our study population comprised 61 patients treated by
interventional radiology alone.
Selection of radiological intervention
Selection of the radiological intervention to be performed has
been described elsewhere.7 Briefly, the intervention was
chosen after assessment by ultrasound to see if there was a
large patent segment(s) of hepatic vein(s) with potential for
flow restoration by balloon dilatation or stenting. Our first
choice was restoration of some hepatic venous outflow by
these methods (recanalisation). In cases where there was a
good segment(s) of patent hepatic vein(s), we attempted

transjugular catheterisation with a view to balloon dilatation
or stent insertion. If access could not be gained from the cava,
then ultrasound guided transhepatic needle puncture of the
vein was performed to allow traversal of the blocked vein
segment out to the inferior vena cava. In such a case the wire
was then snared and pulled out through the jugular vein to
enable balloon dilatation or stent insertion without making
the puncture track in the liver any larger (fig 1). Stent
insertion was normally required if there was insufficient
response to balloon dilatation alone or rapid re-stenosis/
occlusion or recurrent re-stenosis after dilatation. In selected
cases thrombolytic therapy was used as an adjunct to these
procedures.8 If there were no suitable hepatic veins for
recanalisation found by ultrasound or hepatic venography or
if the procedure failed, then we offered TIPS to symptomatic
patients to decompress the liver. Our previously described
algorithm6 for treatment of patients with Budd Chiari
syndrome was followed in all new patients since 1999.
All radiological interventions were classified as minor if
transjugular and/or transfemoral balloon dilatation of the
hepatic vein and/or inferior vena cava was performed. A
major intervention was defined as combined transhepatic/
transjugular balloon dilatation of the hepatic vein and/or
stenting of the hepatic vein or TIPS procedure.
Follow up after radiological intervention
Venography and pressure studies were performed at six
months following the radiological intervention (or earlier if
hepatic vein or TIPS occlusion was suspected) to assess the
patency of hepatic venous outflow or TIPS. Subsequent
follow up of hepatic venous outflow or TIPS was done by six
monthly Doppler ultrasound with annual venography for
TIPS cases. All patients were followed up regularly, both to
monitor hepatic venous outflow or TIPS patency and to detect
overt manifestation or evolution of the underlying thrombo￾philic condition.

Gradation of disease severity at presentation and
statistical analysis
Severity of disease at initial presentation to our centre was
graded by two different prognostic indices.2 3 Actuarial
survival at one and five years was analysed in patients in
different categories of baseline disease severity using the
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS
Description of study population
Sixty one patients were treated by interventional radiology
alone, of which 32 were referred to our unit after 1999 when
the treatment algorithm came into place.6 They were treated
with hepatic vein recanalisation (31), TIPS (26), or both
procedures (four). (In two patients who presented in 1997
and 1999, TIPS procedure failed and they were treated by
mesocaval shunt, one of whom subsequently underwent TIPS
in 2002 when he had occlusion of the mesocaval shunt—
these 2 patients are not included in the study.) The 61
patients (22 males; median age 36 years (range 16–67)) were
followed up for a median of 52 months (range 0–181). The
time interval between the diagnosis of Budd Chiari syndrome
to radiological intervention was ,1 month (43 patients),
1–2 months (four patients), 2–3 months (three patients),
and .3 months (11 patients). In 15 patients minor radi￾ological procedures were performed as the initial definitive
intervention (transjugular balloon dilatation of the hepatic
vein in 12 patients, transjugular and/or transfemoral balloon
dilatation of the inferior vena cava in three patients). Forty
six patients required major interventions for initial definitive
treatment (combined transhepatic/transjugular balloon dila￾tation of the hepatic vein in nine patients, stenting of the
hepatic vein in eight patients, TIPS in 29 patients). While
polytetrafluoroethylene covered TIPS stents were inserted at
the initial intervention in six patients and at subsequent
reintervention after initial bare TIPS stent placement in three
patients, all other TIPS procedures were performed using bare
stents. Additionally, thrombolysis using recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator was performed as an adjunctive
procedure in six patients.
Baseline disease severity in the study cohort
As shown in table 1, patients who underwent hepatic vein
recanalisation had lesser degrees of liver failure at baseline
(assessed by Child’s score, model for end stage liver disease
(MELD) score, and prognostic indices) compared with those
who underwent TIPS.
Adjunctive therapy
Immediately after hepatic vein recanalisation or TIPS, all
patients were anticoagulated with heparin which was
changed to warfarin in a few days (aiming for a target
international normalised ratio of 2.5–3.5). Patients with
myeloproliferative diseases were also treated with hydroxy￾urea or venesection. In 15 patients with essential thrombo￾cythemia or recurrent shunt thrombosis despite adequate
anticoagulation, aspirin 150 mg daily was also added.
Underlying prothrombotic state
An underlying prothrombotic state was identified in 31 of 61
patients. These included 17 patients with myeloproliferative
disorders—polycythemia rubra vera (n = 7), essential throm￾bocythemia (n = 6), myelofibrosis (n = 1), and unclassified
myeloproliferative disorders (n = 3). One patient with homo￾zygous and four with heterozygous mutations of factor V
Leiden gene were detected out of 21 patients tested. The other
thrombophilic states included paroxysmal nocturnal haemo￾globinuria (n = 4), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1),
antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 1), methylene tetrahydrofo￾late reductase gene mutation (n = 1), and prothrombin gene
mutation (n = 1). Ten of the 39 women were on oral
contraceptives, prior to the diagnosis of Budd Chiari
syndrome. Other associated diseases included ulcerative
colitis (n = 1), coeliac disease (n = 1), myelodysplastic
syndrome (n = 1), neurosarcoidosis (n = 1), and history of
multiple cancers in the past (n = 1).
Survival after radiological intervention
Actuarial survival in the entire study cohort at one and five
years was 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88–100%) and
87% (95% CI 78–96%), respectively. As shown in tables 2 and
3, excellent medium term outcome was achieved after
interventional radiology for patients in all categories of
baseline disease severity. Although a significant difference in
survival was not noted between patients with varying grades
of baseline disease severity, there was a trend towards a
significant difference in survival between patients with mild
disease (class I) and those with severe disease (class III), as
shown in table 3. Of the nine patients who died, the cause of
death was attributable to radiological intervention in two
patients (patient Nos 3 and 9 in table 4).
Complications and follow up after radiological
intervention
Complications of radiological intervention were bleeding
hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm after transjugular liver biopsy
performed subsequent to hepatic vein recanalisation and
thrombolysis in one—managed by embolisation—and con￾trast induced renal failure in two (one died, she also had

culture negative neutrocytic ascites and septicaemia). Five
patients developed grade I hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS
(they were not in encephalopathy prior to TIPS) which
responded to treatment with lactulose.
During the follow up period, 40 of the 61 patients
underwent repeated radiological interventions (median
minor procedures 1 (range 0–13); median major procedures
0 (range 0–4)) when necessary to maintain adequate patency
of hepatic venous outflow or TIPS. We analysed the need for
reinterventions over the different time periods of the study.
From 1984 to 1988, of two patients treated, both had 0 major
and two minor reinterventions each. From 1989 to 1993, the
five patients treated underwent 0–3 major (median 0) and 1–
13 minor (median 5) reinterventions. From 1994 to 1998, the
22 patients treated underwent 0–1 major (median 0) and 0–9
minor (median 1) reinterventions. From 1999 to March 2004,
the 32 patients treated underwent 0–3 major (median 0) and
0–5 minor (median: 0) reinterventions.
Patients who were in hepatic encephalopathy at
presentation
Of the 61 patients, one was in grade I hepatic encephalopathy
and another was in grade IV hepatic encephalopathy at
presentation; two other patients were sedated and on
mechanical ventilation at transfer to our hospital. Three of
the four patients who were in hepatic encephalopathy at
presentation had a correctable precipitating factor for hepatic
encephalopathy (oesophageal variceal bleed in two, bacter￾aemia in one) which was treated (endoscopic therapy for
oesophageal varices, antibiotics) and underwent hepatic vein
recanalisation (in one patient) or TIPS (in two patients). All
three patients were alive at follow up, ranging from 12 to
116 months. In contrast, one patient (patient No 9 in table 4)
who was in grade I hepatic encephalopathy at presentation
did not have any precipitating factor for encephalopathy
other than hepatic venous outflow obstruction. He developed
rapid deterioration of sensorium and progressive liver failure
after TIPS and died 12 days after the procedure.
Patients with underlying myeloproliferative disorder
Of the 17 patients with underlying myeloproliferative disease,
one died—the cause of death was attributable to radiological
intervention and not to the myeloproliferative disorder per se
(table 4). Median follow up in the 17 patients with
underlying myeloproliferative disorder was 90 months (range
0–108).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study of the efficacy of interventional
radiology in the management of Budd Chiari syndrome
which has applied prognostic indices to stratify patients into
different grades of disease severity at presentation. We report
excellent medium term survival in all categories of disease
severity. A trend towards statistically significant difference in
survival was noted between patients with mild and severe
disease (table 3) and this needs to be analysed further in
studies including larger number of patients.
The prognostic index for Budd Chiari syndrome derived by
Zeitoun et al was based on a multicentre study, conducted
from 1970 to 1992, of 120 patients with Budd Chiari
syndrome (88 treated by surgical portosystemic shunts and
38 had only medical treatment).2 The prognostic index
derived by Murad et al was based on a multicentre study of
237 patients, conducted from 1984 to 2001, in which 117
patients had surgical portosystemic shunts and 39 had only
medical treatment.3 The present study was conducted in a
single centre from 1984 to March 2004 and analysed patients
who were treated by interventional radiology alone. Thus
differences in study design do not permit comparison of the
efficacy of different treatment modalities. Also, in view of the
retrospective analysis of our study it is not possible to say
whether patients died before they reached our unit. However,
none of the patients in whom the diagnosis of Budd Chiari
syndrome was made and who were transferred to our centre
died while waiting for radiological intervention.
The treatment offered to patients with Budd Chiari
syndrome at our centre over the past 21 years has evolved
from liver transplantation or surgical portosystemic shunts to
percutaneous hepatic vein recanalisation or TIPS (fig 2).
Benefits from restoring physiological hepatic venous outflow
and its less invasive nature makes hepatic vein recanalisation
superior to the other treatment modalities. In patients with
diffuse occlusion of hepatic veins precluding recanalisation or
when recanalisation is not technically feasible, TIPS is the
next preferred treatment modality.6
Our learning curve for these procedures parallels the
evolution of interventional radiology techniques over the
years. Initially we were only able to provide balloon dilatation
of short length venous stenoses or occlusions. With the
introduction of metal stents, it became possible to stent
hepatic veins which did not respond to dilatation or which
rapidly restenosed. We were cautious about the use of stents
at first but recently stented patients need less follow up
venography and/or redilatation compared with those treated

by balloon dilatation alone. Therefore, we now advocate stent
placement immediately after a transhepatic hepatic vein
recanalisation or when balloon dilatation is not immediately
effective in a stenosis. Also, surgical shunts are now reserved
for TIPS failures. TIPS can be more technically challenging in
Budd Chiari syndrome but we have only had two complete
technical failures (1997 and 1999) and one of these had
successful TIPS after late occlusion of a surgical mesocaval
shunt. Budd Chiari patients have required more TIPS
reinterventions than other patients, which might be because
of the increased thrombotic tendency or longer shunts
required. Polytetrafluoroethylene covered TIPS stents are
superior to bare stents in Budd Chiari syndrome, with
improved TIPS patency, lower TIPS dysfunction rate, lower
number of reinterventions, and fewer prosthesis require￾ments.9
Short length stenoses of hepatic veins amenable to
recanalisation remain under recognised and percutaneous
hepatic vein recanalisation is currently an under utilised
treatment modality in the management of Budd Chiari
syndrome. In a study from France, short length stenoses of
hepatic veins were identified in 25 of 86 patients (29%) with
hepatic venous outflow obstruction.10 In 1999, we published
an algorithm for managing patients with Budd Chiari
syndrome with hepatic vein recanalisation as the preferred
first line modality of treatment.6 From 1999 to March 2004,
applying this management algorithm at our centre, 14 of 34
patients (41%) with Budd Chiari syndrome were detected to
have discrete proximal stenoses of hepatic veins and under￾went percutaneous recanalisation of the same. As shown in
table 1, patients with hepatic vein stenosis amenable to
percutaneous recanalisation had lesser degrees of liver failure
(assessed by Child’s score, MELD score, and prognostic
indices) compared with patients with diffuse hepatic vein
occlusion.
Chronic hepatic venous outflow obstruction can be well
compensated and may be asymptomatic. The current
management algorithm for Budd Chiari syndrome at our
centre is shown in fig 3. We advocate hepatic vein
recanalisation, even if the patient is asymptomatic, and
medical treatment as the sole treatment modality is reserved
for the asymptomatic patient in whom recanalisation is not
technically feasible due to diffuse occlusion of hepatic veins.
Restoration of physiologically directed sinusoidal blood flow
not only encourages recovery of liver function but is also
likely to remove the stimuli for macronodular regeneration
which characterises chronic Budd Chiari syndrome and may
predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma.11 Also, restoration of
physiology should improve symptoms, quality of life, and
decrease the need for diuretics and the risk of complications.
These factors will be addressed in future studies.
In our own experience and in other series reported in the
literature, surgical portosystemic shunting for Budd Chiari
syndrome is associated with significant risk of early death
from liver failure.12 13 We postulate that this is in part caused
by inadequate decompression of the liver due to shunt
malfunction by factors such as torsion of the interposition
graft (jugular vein bridging superior mesenteric vein to
inferior vena cava) or to high pressure in the inferior vena
cava due to Budd Chiari induced compression by the caudate
lobe. The results of the current study suggest that radiological
recanalisation is a safe alternative. By draining the portal
circulation directly into the supracaudate portion of the
inferior vena cava, not only does TIPS abrogate these risks
entirely but it has the added advantage that the pressure
gradient between the portal vein and inferior vena cava can
be accurately measured and further adjusted if necessary at
the end of the procedure. Although TIPS has been advocated
as a bridge to liver transplantation,1 our experience is to the
contrary, with good outcome after TIPS as definitive long
term treatment in Budd Chiari syndrome.
Liver transplantation has been considered for patients with
Budd Chiari syndrome presenting with hepatic encephalo￾pathy. However, hepatic encephalopathy is an uncommon
presentation of Budd Chiari syndrome and there are scant
data on treatment outcomes in this situation.1 14 In our
experience, hepatic vein recanalisation is safer than TIPS in
patients with Budd Chiari syndrome presenting with hepatic
encephalopathy. If hepatic vein recanalisation is not techni￾cally feasible, the potential benefit of recovering hepatocyte
function by decongesting the engorged liver by TIPS has to be
weighed against the risk of worsening encephalopathy. Of
the four patients who presented in hepatic encephalopathy in
the current series (one underwent hepatic vein recanalisa￾tion, three had TIPSS), three patients had a correctable
precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy other than
Budd Chiari syndrome, and reversal of the precipitating
factor, in addition to hepatic venous decompression, probably
contributed to the positive outcome in those three patients.
One advantage of interventional radiology in treating Budd
Chiari syndrome is the reduced incidence of complications
compared with procedures requiring laparotomy. A potential
drawback is risk of contrast induced renal failure which can
be minimised by less nephrotoxic contrast agents.15 16
Lifelong anticoagulation, which is advised in Budd Chiari
syndrome, needs close monitoring. In the current series, two
patients died of subdural haemorrhage during anticoagula￾tion (one of whom had thrombocytopenia due to paroxysmal
nocturnal haemoglobinuria) while another died of massive
cerebral infarct, despite being on anticoagulation. Liver
transplantation for Budd Chiari syndrome can theoretically
cure the underlying thrombophilic state, thus obviating the
need for lifelong anticoagulation, although this is not always
the case as multiple aetiological factors may be present in a
single patient.1 17
The role of surgical portosystemic shunts and liver
transplantation in Budd Chiari syndrome is likely to
diminish, in view of the excellent survival possible with
hepatic vein recanalisation and/or TIPS. Simultaneous portal

underwent a successful TIPS) and four patients had medical management
alone (asymptomatic diffuse hepatic vein occlusion in one patient,
symptomatic diffuse hepatic and portal vein occlusion in two patients,
and long segment of discontinuity between the inferior vena cava and
right atrium in one patient which precluded interventional radiological
treatment).

remains a challenging situation with limited treatment
options, although occasionally, TIPS insertion may be
feasible.18 19
In conclusion, we have shown that excellent medium term
survival is achieved by hepatic vein recanalisation and/or
TIPS for Budd Chiari syndrome in all categories of baseline
disease severity.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 763
A repeat Doppler duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed a filiform circumscript
stenosis at the site of the portal vein anastomosis, leading to blood flow acceleration up to
100 cm/s (fig 1A). A computed tomography scan confirmed the stenosis in the extrahepatic
part of the portal vein.
Transjugular measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (5 mm Hg; normal
4–8 mmHg) by wedged pressure measurement confirmed the suspected prehepatic stenosis.
As surgical reanastomosis was considered high risk due to substantial cachexia, a portal
angioplasty was planned. Massive ascites prevented percutaneous portal access. Therefore,
the portal system was accessed via transjugular transhepatic puncture of the right portal
vein. A 95% stenosis was detected by fluoroscopy with a pressure gradient of 30 mm Hg (38/
8 mm Hg distal/proximal of the stenosis) (fig 1B). A gradual angioplasty up to 15 mm was
performed resulting in complete resolution of the pressure gradient with only minimal
residual narrowing (8 mm) (fig 1C, D, E). After intervention, ascites resolved and oesophageal
varices disappeared. In the following months the patient gained 18 kg in weight. Unfortunately,
17 months after the acute Budd-Chiari syndrome breast cancer was detected.
