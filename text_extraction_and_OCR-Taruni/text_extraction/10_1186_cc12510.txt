Abstract
Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the utility of blood neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) assessment as an aid in
the early risk evaluation for AKI development in admitted patients.
Methods: This is a multicenter Italian prospective emergency department (ED) cohort study in which we enrolled
665 patients admitted to hospital from the ED.
Results: Blood NGAL and serum creatinine (sCr) were determined at ED presentation (T0), and at: 6 (T6), 12 (T12),
24 (T24) and 72 (T72) hours after hospitalization. A preliminary assessment of AKI by the treating ED physician
occurred in 218 out of 665 patients (33%), while RIFLE AKI by expert nephrologists was confirmed in 49 out of 665
patients (7%). The ED physician’s initial judgement lacked sensitivity and specificity, overpredicting the diagnosis of
AKI in 27% of the cohort, while missing 20% of those with AKI as a final diagnosis.
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), obtained at T0, for blood NGAL alone in the AKI
group was 0.80. When NGAL at T0 was added to the ED physician’s initial clinical judgment the AUC was increased
to 0.90, significantly greater when compared to the AUC of the T0 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
obtained either by modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation (0.78) or Cockroft-Gault formula (0.78) (P
= 0.022 and P = 0.020 respectively). The model obtained by combining NGAL with the ED physician’s initial clinical
judgement compared to the model combining sCr with the ED physician’s initial clinical judgement, resulted in a
net reclassification index of 32.4 percentage points. Serial assessment of T0 and T6 hours NGAL provided a high
negative predictive value (NPV) (98%) in ruling out the diagnosis of AKI within 6 hours of patients’ ED arrival. NGAL
(T0) showed the strongest predictive value for in-hospital patient’s mortality at a cutoff of 400 ng/ml.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that assessment of a patient’s initial blood NGAL when admitted to hospital
from the ED improved the initial clinical diagnosis of AKI and predicted in-hospital mortality. Blood NGAL
assessment coupled with the ED physician’s clinical judgment may prove useful in deciding the appropriate
strategies for patients at risk for the development of AKI.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as an abrupt decrease
in renal function over a period of hours to days, is a com￾mon complication among hospitalized patients. Its inci￾dence has been increasing in recent years [1-3], and is
reported to be very high (11%) in the emergency depart￾ment (ED) setting [4 -5]. Since clinical signs and symp￾toms of acute renal damage are not specific [3,6,7] it is
difficult to promptly distinguish AKI at the time of ED
presentation. Currently the diagnosis of AKI requires
serial assessment of laboratory tests over a period of sev￾eral days, and is based mainly on serum creatinine (sCr)
as supported by Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-Stage
Kidney Disease (RIFLE) criteria, Acute Kidney Injury
Network (AKIN) criteria and the recent Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) practice guide￾lines for AKI [8-10]. This need for repeated sCr evalua￾tions and monitoring of urinary output for several days
after admission could therefore result in a delay in appro￾priate therapy [3,8-10]. Moreover the application of
the RIFLE criteria to patients presenting to ED is quite
challenging since decrease in urine output is not quanti￾fied, and a prehospital stable baseline sCr is in most of
the cases not available.
As a consequence, the use of biomarkers of acute kidney
damage could be of great utility in the ED in order to dis￾tinguish AKI from volume responsive renal dysfunction,
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or normal renal function
[4,5,11]. Furthermore these biomarkers could contribute
to the diagnosis of AKI by identifying a subgroup with
‘subclinical AKI’ where there may be injury even in the
absence of a sCr increase [12,13], thus leading to an earlier
risk stratification of patients with prompt and specific
treatment strategies.
Among damage biomarkers of AKI, the largest body of
evidence for the detection of AKI prior to sCr increase
exists for both urine and plasma NGAL [4,5,13-21].
Nickolas et al., using a single urine NGAL measurement
in the ED, demonstrated that this biomarker is superior
to sCr in detecting AKI, and has a significant prognostic
ability for these patients [4,5].
Although data exist on a specific acute disease ED
population [22], so far no data have been reported on the
utility of serial blood NGAL assessments in the diagnosis
of AKI and in predicting in-hospital outcomes for general
patient population presenting to the ED and requiring
hospitalization.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the
role of serial assessments of point-of-care (POCT) blood
NGAL, compared to serial sCr assessments for the fast
and accurate diagnosis of clinically adjudicated AKI in
patients hospitalized from the ED for different acute dis￾eases. Furthermore we evaluated if blood NGAL could
have an additive value to the initial clinical judgement
of the ED physician compared to the final expert adjudi￾cated diagnosis of AKI in the acute care population.
Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the uti￾lity of serial blood NGAL measurements and/or sCr as
an aid in the detection of AKI defined by sCr changes,
oliguria, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
Furthermore, we analyzed the utility of NGAL and sCr
used in combination to predict the need for RRT and
in-hospital mortality in the same cohort of patients.
Materials and methods
This was a multicenter prospective clinical trial con￾ducted in three EDs in Italy (Sant’Andrea Hospital in
Rome - the coordinating centre, Vittorio Emanuele Hos￾pital in Catania and San Martino Hospital in Genoa).
The protocol was designed following the criteria of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical
committee of Sant’Andrea Hospital (the coordinating
center) and each participating hospital. Written
informed consent was obtained by each patient prior to
enrolment.
Inclusion criteria: we consecutively enrolled all
patients in the ED who were designated to be admitted
to the hospital for acute process in the period from
November 2008 to April 2009.
Exclusion criteria: less than 18 years of age, patients
with chronic renal insufficiency (sCr ≥ 3.0 mg/dL), on
dialysis or RRT (either acute or chronic) or in imminent
need of dialysis or RRT at enrolment; patients with
urothelial malignancies, subjects not expected to be
admitted and therefore unable to fulfil protocol require￾ments for blood collection at post admission time points;
patients who had participated in an interventional clinical
study within the previous 30 days, and patients unable to
complete the informed consent of the study or to comply
with study procedures.
Data collection
Anamnestic data and demographic information were
recorded. Instrumental diagnostic tests (EKG, chest X-ray,
computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasound assay and
arterial blood gas analysis) were performed where neces￾sary at the discretion of the treating physician and where
not dictated by study protocol. Blood tests for hemochro￾mocytometric examination, urea, creatinine, electrolytes,
cardiac and hepatic enzymes, coagulation tests, and whole
blood NGAL assay were performed for all patients. Each
patient was treated on the basis of the formulated diagno￾sis and therapy was carefully recorded. The presence of
concomitant clinical conditions such as CKD, diabetes and
hypertension were evaluated on the basis of clinical history
fulfilling the criteria of current guidelines [8,23,24].

At the time of ED disposition of each enrolled patient,
the ED treating physician was asked to note an initial
clinical assessment of AKI versus NO AKI, and his level
of confidence in that diagnosis as a percentage (0% to
100%) [25]. This assessment was following the initial
examination and review of the patient’s medical history,
admission sCr levels, and demographic characteristics
(Figure 1). There were no documented pre-study sCr
levels available for any of the enrolled patients. Thus, the
sCr level obtained at ED arrival was used as a baseline
level for these patients.
Renal insults, the development of oliguria, the need
for a nephrology consultation, initiation of dialysis or
RRT (following KDIGO international guidelines)[10],
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and mortality were
recorded through to discharge. Blood samples for
NGAL and sCr were measured in all subjects at the
following time points: T0, at 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) hours,
and on days 1 (T24), 2 (T48) and 3 (T72) (Figure 1).
Blood NGAL measurement
Blood samples were collected into tubes containing
potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and
NGAL was measured using the Triage NGAL assay
(Alere Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The Triage NGAL
test is a point-of-care, fluorescence-based immunoassay
for the rapid quantitative measurement of NGAL con￾centration in whole blood in the range 60 to 1300 ng/ml.
The test procedure is performed by the addition of
several drops of whole blood to the sample port on the
test device. The sample reacts with fluorescent antibody
conjugates in the reaction chamber, and flows down the
reaction lane by capillary action. The conjugates are then
captured on discrete solid-phase zones resulting in the
binding of immunoassays specific for NGAL antigens.
The concentration of the analyte is inversely correlated
to the fluorescence detected. Therefore, the NGAL test is
based on the amount of fluorescence the meter detects.
The Triage platform is a POCT system designed for
bedside use, capable of reporting a test result in 15 to 20
minutes and has been already used to measure NGAL
[26]. The results of NGAL were blinded to the medical
team during the study and did not impact the medical
management of the subject.
Blood NGAL cutoff 150 to 400 ng/ml
A cutoff of 150 ng/ml was selected in ruling out the
diagnosis of AKI because it had previously been pub￾lished as a high sensitivity threshold for AKI prediction
[20,22]. It is also the published 95th percentile of normal
for the assay [22]. A cutoff of 400 ng/ml was selected as
a high specificity threshold for AKI diagnosis based

upon internal analysis that has been done on other sets
of data [21].
sCr and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
measurements
Creatinine was measured by an immunoenzymatic assay
(Vitros Crea; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, High Wycombe,
UK). The normal range is 0.8 to 1.5 mg/dl. Estimated glo￾merular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the mod￾ification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation based
on four variables (age, sex, race and gender) recom￾mended by the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initia￾tive (KDOQI) guidelines [10,27]. eGFR obtained by
Cockroft-Gault formula was also calculated at each con￾sidered time point in all patients [28].
Kidney function - patients’ classification
Based on patient case review, blinded to NGAL results,
by two expert nephrologists at the coordinating center,
each patient was assigned to one of the following diag￾nostic categories:
1. Preserved renal function: patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/
min per 1.73 m2 that did not meet the criteria of any of
the other categories [8].
2. Stable chronic kidney disease (CKD): patients with a
sustained elevation of sCr level indicative of a reduced
eGFR of <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, that did not elevate
beyond the criteria for AKI and persisted for more than
three months before hospitalization [8].
3. Renal dysfunction: patients with evidence of a new￾onset increase in sCr level or decline in eGFR that
exceeded the definition for AKI and either resolved
within three days with treatment aimed at restoring per￾fusion (for example intravenous volume repletion or
discontinuation of diuretics), or was accompanied by
fractional excretion of sodium less than 1% at time of
admission [5,13].
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): as assigned by expert
adjudication with consideration of the RIFLE criteria for
urine output and eGFR changes during the patient’s
admission [8]. In particular a new-onset 1.5-fold
increase in sCr level or 25% decreases in eGFR from
baseline, or oliguria were considered. Secondary analysis
using AKI endpoints based solely on sCr increase in 48
hours by AKIN criteria, by RIFLE criteria (I&F), includ￾ing recovery from I and F and by oliguria were also per￾formed [8,9]. Recovery from RIFLE ‘I’ and ‘F’ were
defined by an in-hospital decrease of sCr value equal or
greater than 100% and 200% respectively when using
the lowest post peak sCr as a reference[8].
Stable CKD is not acute and renal dysfunction, as
defined, is a reversible process and not reflective of intrin￾sic AKI, therefore, these two categories were included with
normal preserved renal function as NO AKI.
Statistical analysis
NGAL and sCr levels were presented as mean ± stan￾dard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data, and
as median interquartile range (IQR) in case of abnor￾mally distributed data.
The ED clinical confidence of AKI was correlated with
the final diagnosis of AKI as defined above. The area
under the curve (AUCs) of the receiver-operating char￾acteristic (ROC), and odds ratios (OR) were calculated
to quantify the accuracy of both NGAL and clinician
judgment, individually and combined, in the prediction
and assessment of AKI.
The utility of serial measurements of NGAL was also
assessed for the same outcome. Because the aim of this
study was the early recognition of AKI in the acute care
setting, we specifically focused on the operating charac￾teristics of NGAL in the first few hours: T0 and T6.
The corresponding cutoffs and clinical performance
parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diag￾nostic accuracy) were evaluated. ROC curves using
more than a single predictor (for example, NGAL and
clinical judgment), are based on fitting a logistic regres￾sion model using the ‘glm’ package of R. The output of
the model was then used for the ROC curve. Note that
for a single predictor (for example, NGAL), the ROC
curve based on an output of a logistic regression model
is identical to the ROC curve based directly on the pre￾dictor, and any cut points will be the same when inter￾preted in terms of the predictor.
The correlation of baseline biomarkers, demographic
variables, and clinical variables to clinical outcomes
were assessed through box plots, ROCs, AUCs, and
logistic regression. The 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) were calculated for AUCs. For each cutoff, the OR,
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accu￾racy were calculated along with and the 95% CI. Serial
NGAL levels were assessed via box plots of the distribu￾tion at each blood draw time grouped by AKI versus
NO AKI. Serial NGAL levels were assessed in absolute
concentration, relative to baseline and relative to pre￾vious draw. The cutoff and estimated clinical sensitivity
and specificity of the NGAL test to indicate the risk of
these outcomes were calculated. The sensitivity and spe￾cificity of the physicians’ clinical judgment for these out￾comes was also calculated alone, and in combination
with the Triage NGAL test results. Analysis of the
potential reduction in clinical indecision provided by the
NGAL test results was also performed.
The statistical significance was assessed by t test if
data were normally distributed, otherwise by a nonpara￾metric test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate.
The statistical significance of the association between
dichotomous variables was assessed by the Fisher exact

test and chi square test. A net reclassification index
(NRI) analysis was used to assess improvement in the
accuracy of the risk-prediction model for in-hospital
mortality. The threshold for statistical significance was
a <0.05. Revolution R Enterprise version 4.2 (Revolution
Analytics, Palo Alto, CA, USA), SPSS version 14 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) and Medcalc version12.1.4 (Medcalc
Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) software were used.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Some 665 of the 700 patients enrolled (357M; 308F;
mean age 74 ± 14.4 years) were included in the statisti￾cal analysis. Thirty-five patients were excluded: eight did
not consent, twenty-one withdrew from the study, and
six had incomplete data (Figure 1). Patients’ characteris￾tics are reported in Table 1. There was no significant
difference in sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and blood
pressure distribution within AKI and NO AKI groups of
patients recorded at the time of admission. Chronic kid￾ney disease and chronic heart failure related to cardiac
valvular diseases were significantly more frequent in
AKI patients when compared to NO AKI (respectively
P < 0.03 and P < 0.04). The incidence of AKI was signif￾icantly higher in patients with in-hospital diagnosis of
sepsis (P < 0.03) (Table 1). AKI was confirmed in 49
(7%) cases of 665 examined patients on the basis of
expert nephrologists adjudication of cases: by RIFLE ‘R’
in 9, RIFLE ‘I’ and ‘F’ in 8, recovery from RIFLE ‘I’ and
‘F’ in 6 patients; by AKIN criteria in 10 patients; RRT in
2 patients and by oliguria in 14 patients (Figure 1). The
ED physician’s initial clinical judgment gave a presump￾tive diagnosis of AKI in 218 (32.7%) patients, but cap￾tured only 39 of those patients with a confirmed final
adjudicated diagnosis of AKI, failing to identify the
other 10.
The mean (± SD) blood NGAL and sCr levels in the
whole study population, in AKI, and in NO AKI groups
at each measured time are shown in Figure 2. NGAL
mean values in AKI patients were significantly higher at
each considered time point compared to patients with
NO AKI (P < 0.001). sCr mean values were also higher

in AKI patients in comparison to NO AKI patients at
each considered time (P < 0.001). Table 2 lists NGAL
values in the AKI and NO AKI groups based on dis￾charge diagnosis. In patients with sepsis, pneumonia and
acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) NGAL
values at T0 in AKI patients were significantly higher
compared to patients with NO AKI (P < 0.001). Figure
3 shows the difference between NGAL (Figure 3A) and
sCr (Figure 3B) levels at admission for patients with
adjudicated AKI, renal dysfunction, stable CKD or pre￾served renal function. Between groups, NGAL values in
adjudicated AKI patients were significantly higher com￾pared to the other three groups of patients (Figure 3A).
Admission mean sCr level in patients with adjudicated
AKI was significantly increased compared to patients
with stable CKD (P < 0.002) or preserved renal function
(P < 0.001), while there was no difference between sCr
levels at admission for patients with AKI compared to
patients with renal dysfunction. The ROC curve analysis
showed that NGAL at baseline alone or combined with
the ED physician’s initial clinical judgment was highly
predictive of RIFLE AKI (Figure 4). There were no dif￾ferences between AUC of NGAL (T0) (0.80 + 0.04) in
comparison to AUC of eGFR (T0) obtained by MDRD
(0.80 + 0.04), and to AUC of eGFR obtained by Cock￾roft-Gault (0.80 + 0.04). However, the AUC of NGAL
plus the ED physician’s clinical judgement was signifi￾cantly higher than the AUC of eGFR (either obtained by
MDRD or by Cockroft-Gault) plus the ED physician’s
clinical judgement (0.90 vs. 0.78, P = 0.022 and 0.90 vs.
0.78, P = 0.020, respectively). Serial assessment of
T0 and T6 hours NGAL provides a high NPV (98%) in
ruling out the diagnosis of AKI within 6 hours of
patients’ ED arrival. In an NRI analysis, the same model
combining NGAL (T0) with the ED physician’s cli￾nical judgement was compared to a model combining
Figure 2 Mean ± SD neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and serum creatinine (sCr) values at each considered time of
serial assessment.

admission sCr (T0) results with the ED physician’s clini￾cal judgement and the NRI (95% CI) was 32.4 percen￾tage points (3.02 to 61.8), meaning that the percentage
correct in the classification of AKI improved signifi￾cantly by 32.4 points.
Table 3 represents the AUCs, OR and the sensitivity,
specificity, NPV, and PPV of NGAL thresholds 150≥ ng/
ml and ≥400 ng/ml for the RIFLE diagnosis of AKI as
well as the secondary definitions based on AKIN cri￾teria, oliguria. In our data an NGAL cutoff >400 ng/ml
gives the highest odds ratio (OR 22.5) for the prediction
of the final RIFLE diagnosis of AKI. Total in-hospital
mortality was 4.06%. Figure 5 demonstrates the relation￾ship between admission NGAL at cutoff of 400 ng/ml
and in-hospital mortality (OR 8.3, P < 0.001). In order
to evaluate the additive value of NGAL and sCr in the
risk stratification of patients for the outcomes of in-hos￾pital mortality and the need for RRT, we applied the
high specificity threshold for NGAL (400 ng/mL) and
the threshold for sCr increase according to RIFLE ‘R’
criteria to assign patients to four groups.
We stratified subjects in sCr+ (sCr ≥50% increase) or
sCr- (sCr <50% increase) and NGAL+ (NGAL >400 ng/
ml) or NGAL- (NGAL <400 ng/ml). There were 2 patients
in our cohort who required RRT and 26 who suffered in￾hospital mortality. For the combined endpoint of RRT or
mortality there were 27 patients. Figure 6 shows that the
event rate for the combined endpoint of in-hospital

mortality and the need for RRT were highest for patients
in the sCr+ and NGAL+ group and lowest for patients
who were in the sCr- and NGAL- group. Furthermore, the
patients that were NGAL+ and sCr- had a higher inci￾dence of the combined endpoint than those who were
NGAL- and sCr+. The OR for the combined endpoint of
RRT and in-hospital mortality for the NGAL+, sCr- group
compared to the group with both biomarkers negative was
9.45 (2.77 to 28.57, P = 0.0002), while the NGAL-, sCr+
group had an OR of 4.05 (0.71 to 15.46, P = 0.056) and the
group with both markers positive had an OR of 23.84
(1.87 to 223.43, P = 0.008).
Discussion
The identification of AKI in patients presenting with
heterogeneous comorbidities is difficult because sCr rise
and decreasing urinary output take time to detect [29].
Our study demonstrated that blood NGAL measure￾ments were useful in predicting development of AKI at
time of admission from the ED. This result confirms
data available from the literature on the same cohort of
patients [4,5,13,29-33]. From our data, the ED physi￾cian’s judgment lacked sensitivity and specificity, in pre￾dicting the RIFLE diagnosis in 27% of the AKI cohort,
while missing 20% of those with a final diagnosis of
AKI. The addition of NGAL to the ED physician’s
assessment not only decreased the number of patients
erroneously suspected of AKI at initial presentation
(false positives), but also identified additional patients
that were missed in the early stages of this assessment.
From our results, for the diagnosis of AKI, it seems
that there was no difference between the AUCs obtained
with NGAL alone or with eGFR, calculated either with
MDRD or Cockroft-Gault. This suggests that the ability
of NGAL to diagnose AKI is not inferior to the current
commonly used standard of care marker. However,
when NGAL was added to the ED physician’s clinical
judgment the AUC was increased compared to clinical
judgment alone or compared to the combination of clin￾ical judgment and eGFR (MDRD or Cockroft-Gault).
Moreover the advantage of coupling NGAL and the ED
physician’s clinical judgment is demonstrated by the
increase of AKI prediction (NRI = 32.4%), these results
imply that the addition of a blood NGAL could more

accurately triage patients on arrival than the use of cur￾rent standards alone.
The use in our study of a rapid point-of-care platform
testing system that provides quantitative NGAL results
from whole blood in 15 minutes [26] adds important
clinical implications to our results since the time to
diagnosis in the ED is inversely related to the optimal
patient outcome. Inherent to this is prompt initiation of
treatment and timely patient disposition. The use of
NGAL as an early biomarker of kidney tubular injury
could have important clinical implications in the ED set￾ting; an early detection of kidney damage may lead to
more timely specialist consultations, specific therapeutic
approaches and final dispositions. Consequently, this
may lead to a decrease in the progression of kidney
damage with improved patient outcomes and reduced
health care expense [34]. This is also confirmed from
our data which demonstrate that the patients presenting
to the ED with NGAL and sCr positive values are at
higher risk to develop in-hospital events such as death
and need of RRT. For patients with NGAL and sCr
within normal ranges, the ED physician could promptly
rule out AKI while in subjects with elevated NGAL and/
or sCr values he should probably consider specific thera￾peutic options. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first multicenter study performed on the blood samples
of this biomarker applied to all patients hospitalized from
the ED [4,5]. In fact the recent paper from Nickolas et al.
[4] was also an ED multicenter study but using urinary
NGAL. The incidence of AKI (7%) in our cohort of
patients was similar to that obtained by Nickolas et al. [5].
While Shapiro et al. also investigated the use of a blood
NGAL POCT assessment in the ED, they considered only
patients with suspected sepsis [22]. Our cohort included
patients with sepsis, ADHF, pneumonia, stroke, severe
dehydration, liver cirrhosis and several other critical condi￾tions, many of which are often contemporaneously pre￾sent, especially in older patients. Consequently our data
are applicable to a large number of undifferentiated
patients coming to the ED requiring hospitalization. Our
results are more generalizable to the undifferentiated ED
population because the recently published data on the role
of blood NGAL in detecting AKI in the ED have been
showed in restricted populations such as: patients with
sepsis [22], or with lower respiratory tract infection, or
with cardiorenal syndrome by using a multi-marker
approach [35-44].
In our study, the incidence of final expert-adjudicated
AKI was higher than AKI as defined by RIFLE criteria,
AKIN criteria or the development of oliguria during
hospitalization [8,9]. This result raises the possibility
that RIFLE or AKIN criteria [8,9], currently suggested as
the standard methods for diagnosing AKI, may have
limited utility in the early detection of AKI in the ED.
This is consistent with the findings of Haase et al. and
Nickolas et al. [4,13]. Nevertheless, since in the study a
pre-study sCr level was not available, we cannot exclude
(as a limitation of the results) that a significant propor￾tion of patients could have already had an increase in
sCr and NGAL values before ED presentation.
In the last decade, data have been published on a single
measurement of NGAL with a wide range of specificity
and sensitivity for diagnosis of AKI [5,16,20,37-39]. This
wide variability could be explained by differing times of
measurement and different NGAL cutoffs that have been
proposed for the diagnosis of AKI. We decided to use the
cutoff of 150 ng/ml because it is internationally consid￾ered a high sensitivity threshold for AKI prediction
[20,22,40]. A cutoff of 400 ng/ml has been demonstrated
to be a high specificity threshold based upon interna￾tional analysis that has been done on other data sets [21].
For septic patients, other authors considered NGAL cut￾off values that ranged from 150 to 400 ng/ml [22,41].
Still others have used a cutoff value of 170 ng/ml,
demonstrating that NGAL predicts 48 to 72 hour devel￾opment of type 1 cardiorenal syndrome with NPV of
100% and PPV of 50% [18,38,42,43]. Building a ROC
curve on the basis of NGAL T0, we obtained a cutoff
value of 137 ng/ml for final diagnosis of AKI. This is very
similar to the 150 ng/ml expressed in the literature [20].
Using a cutoff of 150 ng/ml and two serial NGAL
measurements (T0, T6), we could establish a NPV of
98% within 6 hours of the patient’s arrival. In the acute
setting, the possibility of ruling out the occurrence of
severe diseases such as AKI is of great importance
[38,39,43,44]. On the other hand, NGAL value above
cutoff of 400 ng/ml seems to be very specific for ruling
on the diagnosis of AKI. Consequently, it appears that
with NGAL, similar to the use of B-type natriuretic pep￾tide (BNP) for diagnosis of heart failure [38] and for
many other biomarkers, there could exist a grey zone
where the clinical judgment coupled with biomarker
assessment is crucial to the prompt and accurate diag￾nosis of AKI [45]. In our study, blood NGAL also
demonstrated the ability to differentiate intrinsic AKI
from other renal diseases/dysfunction at initial assess￾ment. NGAL values were significantly higher in patients
with AKI when compared to patients with renal dys￾function or stable CKD. These results are similar to the
Nickolas studies on urinary NGAL [4]. From our results,
blood NGAL value in this group of patients with renal
dysfunction was significantly higher compared to
patients with stable CKD and to patients with preserved
renal function, a finding that is consistent with those of
Singer et al .[38]. This allows clinicians to distinguish
between chronic disease and early reversible kidney
damage. From our results it was evident that sCr was not
able to distinguish this difference, since the value of sCr
Di Somma et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R29
http://ccforum.com/content/17/1/R29
Page 10 of 13

in this group with renal dysfunction was not increased at
baseline evaluation compared to patients with stable
CKD or with preserved renal function. From our data,
NGAL could not only be considered a diagnostic marker
but also a prognostic biomarker. Admission NGAL has
been shown to be able to predict in-hospital mortality
with a high OR (8.3) when a threshold of 400 ng/ml was
used. Admission NGAL value above 400 ng/ml had a
high AUC (0.76 +/- 0.11) for in-hospital mortality. The
ability to predict which patients will likely need RRT and
which have a high probability of in-hospital death has
understated importance in resource utilization.
Conclusions
In summary, our study demonstrated that admission blood
NGAL measurements are useful in the early diagnosis of
AKI. Baseline NGAL measurement allows detection of
AKI earlier than sCr. Improved diagnostic performance
was demonstrated when NGAL was combined with clini￾cal judgment. NGAL is also able to distinguish intrinsic
AKI from early reversible kidney dysfunction while sCr
cannot.
Blood NGAL levels detected development of acute
renal injury at 6 hours, nearly 2 days earlier than sCr
increases at 48 hours. Blood NGAL assessment at the
moment of hospital admission from the ED predicted the
combined outcome of RRT and in-hospital mortality.
The use of this kidney injury biomarker in the early
detection of renal involvement and risk stratification of
patients at the time of ED presentation may permit earlier
interventions and more appropriate patient management
strategies.
Key messages
• Admission blood NGAL measurements are useful in
the early diagnosis of AKI.
• Baseline NGAL measurement allows detection of
AKI earlier than sCr.
• Blood NGAL assessment at the moment of hospital
admission from ED predicted the combined outcome of
RRT and in-hospital mortality.
