Transthyretin and light-chain amyloidosis are the 2 main causes
of cardiac amyloidosis. Recent developments in molecular imaging
have transformed our ability to diagnose transthyretin cardiac
amyloidosis noninvasively and unmasked a hitherto unrecognized
prevalence of the disease. This review summarizes the current and
evolving imaging approaches, their molecular structural basis, and
the gaps in imaging capabilities that have arisen as a result of
parallel developments in pharmacotherapy delivering the first
effective treatment options for this condition.

Cardiac amyloidosis is considered to be a rare disease,
defined in the United States as a condition that affects fewer
than 200,000 people (1). However, the recent adoption of
noninvasive diagnostic approaches has unmasked a hitherto
unrecognized community prevalence of wild-type amyloid
transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis (CA), reversing
prior impressions of its lower prevalence than amyloid light￾chain (AL) amyloidosis (40.5 cases per million) (2). Quite
serendipitously, parallel developments in pharmacotherapy
have resulted in the recent approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration of 3 new agents for treating ATTR
amyloidosis, with many clinical studies under way of new
agents and expanded applications of approved ones. Taken
together, these developments in diagnosis and therapy have
transformed and invigorated the field of CA, which, until
quite recently, relied solely on an invasive myocardial biopsy
for diagnosis and faced therapeutic nihilism for ATTR am￾yloidosis. These developments have also spurred a renewed
interest in the imaging of CA, with emphasis on diagnosis,
differentiation of amyloid type, and monitoring of therapy.
THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS
The term amyloid was coined by Schleiden and used by
Virchow in the mid-19th century based on the property of
staining with iodine (amyloid 5 starchlike) (3). However,
today we know that amyloid is derived from the misfolding
of proteins (not starch) into long, unbranched fibrils of ap￾proximately 10 nm in diameter and several micrometers in
length with a specific b-sheet structure that is extremely
stable and resistant to degradation by cells. Amyloid diseases
are generally chronic and occur because of progressive ex￾tracellular accumulation of amyloid in tissues, resulting in
impaired function of the affected organs.
More than 30 different specific amyloid diseases have been
described, with organ tropism and clinical manifestations
driven by the protein of origin. Examples include Alzheimer
disease, b-2 microglobulin-related amyloidosis in chronic di￾alysis patients, and systemic amyloid A amyloidosis associ￾ated with chronic inflammation. Irrespective of the protein of
origin, all amyloid is morphologically indistinguishable and
characterized by an antiparallel b-sheet secondary structure
(in which the N- and C- terminals are oriented in opposite
directions), which gives it its characteristic imaging proper￾ties with Congo red (red deposits on light microscopy and
apple-green birefringence under polarized-light microscopy)
and thioflavin T (yellow-green fluorescence) (2). The hetero￾geneity of organ involvement and clinical syndromes, despite
morphologic homogeneity, is one of the mysteries of this
intriguing disease.
The majority (95%) of clinical CA is due to deposition of
either transthyretin (TTR) or immunoglobulin AL–derived
amyloid, which produce clinical diseases that differ vastly
in their phenotypic expression, prognosis, and therapy. Rare
cases of CA are derived from other precursor proteins, such
as apolipoprotein A1. Amyloid fibril type is most specifically
confirmed with immunohistochemistry or mass spectroscopy
of biopsy material.
AL amyloidosis is the result of the unregulated proliferation
of a single clone of plasma cells (a monoclonal gammopathy)
resulting in the overproduction of immunoglobulin ALs that
transform into amyloid in tissues. Certain isotypes (l) and
variability subgroups (lVI) seem to confer a tendency to
amyloidogenesis, since only a small proportion of patients
with a plasma cell dyscrasia actually develop clinical amy￾loidosis (4). AL is a systemic disease with prognosis driven

largely by the toxic–infiltrative cardiomyopathy (5). Hence,
early diagnosis before advanced cardiac involvement that
precludes chemotherapy is a key factor determining survival,
potentially giving diagnostic imaging a key role in the eval￾uation of these patients. One of the critical steps in the
evaluation (including imaging) of the patient with suspected
CA is the identification of the amyloid type, since a mistaken
diagnosis of ATTR for AL amyloidosis can have disastrous
consequences.
ATTR amyloidosis is derived from TTR, a carrier of
thyroxine and retinol bound to retinol-binding protein that is
produced largely by the liver and, in smaller amounts, by the
retinal epithelium and choroid plexus. The transformation of
this 127-amino-acid protein into amyloid is stimulated by
either unknown mechanisms related to aging in wild-type
ATTR or by at least 120 known point mutations in its gene
located on the long arm of chromosome 18, resulting in
single-amino-acid substitutions in variant ATTR. Specific
mutations result in well-described but not exclusive cardiac,
neuropathic, or mixed phenotypes. The most common TTR
gene mutation worldwide is V30M. In the United States, the
V122I mutation is the most prevalent and is carried by 3%–
4% of the African American population (6). In contrast to
AL amyloidosis, the cardiac consequences of ATTR appear
to result mostly from infiltration of the myocardium, with less
evidence of direct toxic effects.
Contemporary clinical data suggest that there is generally
a lag period of 2 or more years between the patient’s first
presentation to a physician and the diagnosis of CA (7).
Recent educational efforts have focused on increasing aware￾ness of red-flag clinical features. In this context, imaging
plays a key role in the early and accurate diagnosis of CA.
ESTABLISHED IMAGING APPROACHES
Contemporary imaging approaches are listed in Table 1
and illustrated in Figure 1. On echocardiography, the initial
suspicion of CA is often spurred by the nonspecific finding
of increased left ventricular thickness, which can be asymmet￾ric in up to 20% of patients (8). Other findings on echocardi￾ography include left and right atrial enlargement, increased
thickness of the right ventricular walls and the interatrial
septum, pericardial effusion, diastolic dysfunction, and a
longitudinal strain abnormality with relative apical sparing
(7). A previously described granular speckled appearance of
the myocardium is now thought to be nonspecific for amy￾loidosis. Diagnostic confirmation of amyloidosis generally
requires a tissue biopsy, and echocardiographic findings do
not distinguish between ATTR and AL CA. Given the non￾specific nature of echocardiography findings, its diagnostic
accuracy even in combination with electrocardiography find￾ings is only 60% (9).
Cardiac MR
In addition to the morphologic abnormalities seen on
echocardiography, a unique abnormality of gadolinium kinetics,
seen as an inability to null the myocardium on the inversion
time mapping sequence along with early clearance of tracer
from the blood pool, is typical. Native T1 time and the extra￾cellular volume fraction are generally higher in amyloidosis
than other commonly encountered conditions producing in￾creased left ventricular thickness, and a high extracellular
volume is associated with a particularly negative prognosis
in amyloidosis (10). Cardiac MR features do not reliably dis￾tinguish between ATTR and AL CA, and the possibility of a
negative cardiac MR result in biopsy-proven amyloidosis is
reported to be up to 12% (9).

Radionuclide Scintigraphy with Bone-Seeking Tracers
A resurgence of interest and an improved understanding
of the performance characteristics of myocardial scintigraphy
with the 99mTc-labeled bone-seeking tracers 99mTc-pyrophosphate,
3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD),
and 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate have been trans￾formative for the field of CA. A recent multinational study of
1,212 patients reported a high sensitivity and near-perfect
specificity for ATTR CA if plasma cell disease is excluded
by serum studies (11), and a metaanalysis of 5 studies found
a sensitivity of 92.2% (95% confidence interval, 89%–95%)
and specificity of 95.4% (97%–99%) (12). This tropism of
the bone-seeking tracers for ATTR, but not AL, amyloid￾osis is probably attributable to calcium binding (13). Car￾diac scintigraphy has greatly expanded the pool of patients
being tested for CA and obviated a myocardial biopsy in
cases of clinical suspicion with positive scintigraphy and
negative serum studies. Reports suggest an unexpectedly
high prevalence of ATTR amyloidosis in defined popula￾tions such as patients with heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction and even mildly increased left ventricular
wall thickness (13%), patients with paradoxic low-gradient
severe aortic stenosis (10%), and African American patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the
United States (6).
Among the bone-seeking tracers useful in CA, 99mTc￾pyrophosphate is available in the United States. Of note,
99mTc-methyldiphosphonate, which is widely used for bone
scans, is not useful for amyloidosis
imaging because of poor sensitivity.
99mTc-pyrophosphate scintigraphy is
a relatively simple test that is widely
available and applicable in a broad
range of patients, including those with
relative contraindications to other im￾aging modalities, such as atrial fibril￾lation, implanted cardiac devices,
contrast allergy, renal dysfunction,
and extreme obesity. The combination
of high clinical efficacy (diagnostic ac￾curacy) and clinical effectiveness (ap￾plicability) make it highly useful for
screening.
Interpretation is based on a semi￾quantitative visual grading of tracer
uptake, first proposed by Perugini
(grade 0 5 no myocardial uptake,
grade 1 5 myocardial , rib uptake,
grade 2 5 myocardial equal to ribs,
and grade 3 5 myocardial . rib up￾take, usually with diminished bone
uptake) (14). Grades $ 2 are con￾sidered positive. Figure 2 shows a
typical example of a positive 99mTc￾pyrophosphate scan. Prior reports of
99mTc-pyrophosphate uptake in some patients with AL am￾yloidosis have prompted a strong recommendation for
mandatory serum studies (serum-free AL assay and immu￾nofixation electrophoresis) in all patients undergoing scintig￾raphy (15). A quantitative heart-to-contralateral ratio has
been proposed for 99mTc-pyrophosphate, with values
greater than 1.5 being highly specific for ATTR (16). Guidelines
recommend imaging at 1 or 3 h (or both) after tracer in￾jection. The principal confounder of planar imaging is the
presence of tracer in the cardiac blood pool resulting in a
spuriously elevated planar grade and a false-positive result.
SPECT imaging is extremely useful to distinguish between
blood pool and myocardial tracer (Fig. 3). More recent pro￾spective studies indicate no added advantage of 3-h imag￾ing when both planar and SPECT imaging are performed at
1h(17). A major disadvantage of 99mTc-pyrophosphate
scintigraphy is the lack of practical approaches for quan￾tification of absolute tracer uptake and serial imaging of
disease burden, an important need in the current era of
amyloid pharmacotherapy. Occasionally, an incidental
finding of myocardial uptake is noted in 99mTc-labeled
bone scans. We feel that the referring physician should
be alerted to this finding, but its prognostic and therapeutic
implications in the asymptomatic patient remain unclear.
EVOLVING IMAGING APPROACHES
Several PET tracers have been studied for CA, including
the thioflavin T analogs 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (18),
FIGURE 1. Molecular mechanism of amyloidosis and imaging characteristics
illustrated for ATTR amyloidosis and AL amyloidosis. Echocardiography, CMR, and
thioflavin-analog PET tracers detect both types, whereas 99mTc-labeled bone tracers
(BST) are avidly taken up only by ATTR amyloidosis. Notably, hereditary amyloidosis
resulting from some mutations result in type B amyloid fibrils, which are less avid for
BST. On the other hand, prior reports suggest that some patients with AL may show
BST uptake. Differentiation of ATTR from AL amyloidosis is a critical step in evaluation
of patients with suspected CA. Wt 5 wild-type.

18F-florbetapir (19), 18F-florbetaben (20), and 18F-fluteme￾tamol (21). These agents were all developed for imaging
cerebral Ab-amyloid in Alzheimer disease and are taken up
by myocardial amyloid. They do not, however, distinguish
between ATTR and AL. A major impetus for the develop￾ment of amyloid PET tracers has been the expectation of
more accurate quantification abilities than are possible with
SPECT. In preliminary studies, quantitative metrics show
higher myocardial uptake in patients with AL or ATTR CA
than in controls (19,22), in AL patients than in ATTR pa￾tients (23), and in chemotherapy-na¨ıve patients than in
postchemotherapy patients (24). 18F-NaF, an agent used
to image bone metastases in several types of cancer, targets
microcalcifications. Small studies suggest utility for the
diagnosis of ATTR CA, with quantitative parameters able
to distinguish patients with ATTR CA from AL CA and
controls (25). The affinity of 18F-NaF for ATTR CA cor￾roborates the calcium hypothesis to explain the binding of
bone-seeking tracers to ATTR. Serum amyloid P component
is a circulating plasma protein that has high affinity for am￾yloid fibrils and is a nonfibrillar component of all types of
amyloid. Theoretically, SAP targeted imaging should be spe￾cific for tissue amyloid. However, the SPECT tracer 123I￾SAP was found to be less useful for cardiac imaging because
of high blood-pool activity and poor count statistics in the
myocardium (26). Another SPECT tracer, 99mTc-aprotinin, tar￾gets this serum protease inhibitor found in amyloid de￾posits. However, its utility is also limited by poor-quality
images (27). Similarly, a murine monoclonal antibody de￾veloped against ALs and labeled with iodine was found to
have limited use in CA (28)
BINDING MECHANISMS: INSIGHTS FROM
STRUCTURE–FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS
The structure of TTR-derived amyloid fibrils was re￾cently revealed using cryoelectron microscopy (29). Pertur￾bations in the structural conformation of the precursor
protein are at the center of amyloidogenesis. Interestingly,
at least 2 identified rescue mutations, T119M and R104H,
stabilize TTR in patients who are compound heterozygotes
for a pathogenic mutation and prevent expression of disease
(30). Despite the heterogeneity of the mechanisms leading
to amyloid formation (aging, gene mutation, proteolytic
remodeling), the amyloid fibril is characterized by relative
structural homogeneity. Early studies exploring the binding
mechanism of thioflavin T suggested that the surface of the
cross b structures forms the binding site, and the orientation
of the side chains may be the common pattern that deter￾mines the affinity of thioflavin T to a broad range of amy￾loid fibrils (31). The binding mechanism of thioflavin T is
shared by analogous tracers, including 11C-Pittsburgh com￾pound B and the 18F-tracers (Fig. 4). The SPECT and PET
tracers bind by different, not yet fully elucidated, mecha￾nisms. It would seem logical to attribute the tropism of the

chest reconstruction than cardiac reconstruction.

SPECT bone-seeking tracers to calcium binding; however,
there are only sparse clinical data to support this notion. To
specifically explore tracer binding of the bone-seeking trac￾ers, Stats et al. performed a unique study of endomyocar￾dial biopsies from 8 ATTR and AL amyloidosis patients
(13). Using specific stains and immunohistochemistry, they
reported a greater density of microcalcification in biopsies
from ATTR patients and a greater density of macrophages in
biopsies from AL patients, supporting a calcium-based binding
mechanism of bone tracer uptake in ATTR. In this regard, it is
relevant that 99mTc-pyrophosphate was introduced as a tracer
for the imaging of subacute myocardial infarction, where its
uptake correlates with calcium deposits in the infarcted myo￾cardium (32), and that 18F-NaF is a tracer that specifically binds
to sites of active microcalcification. These facts further support
a calcium hypothesis to explain the binding of these tracers. Of
clinical relevance, some of the cases of AL in the study of Stats
et al. demonstrated densities of microcalcification comparable
to ATTR cases, consistent with the clinical finding of 99mTc￾DPD/99mTc-pyrophosphate positivity in some patients with AL
amyloidosis.
The mechanistic basis of increased calcification in ATTR
is unknown. The density of calcification in the study of Stats
et al. was unrelated to age, cardiac function, renal function,
or serum calcium. The authors postulate that the denser
microcalcification in ATTR may be a reflection of chronicity
compared with the typical time course of AL. The finding of
a higher density of macrophages in biopsies from patients
with localized AL is consistent with prior studies showing
18F-FDG uptake in these patients (33).
Although amyloid fibrils derived from different precursor
proteins are mostly structurally homogeneous, recent reports
using Western blot analysis have indicated the existence of 2
types of amyloid fibrils derived from TTR. Type A fibrils
consist of a mixture of C-terminal fragments (N-terminally
truncated) and full-length TTR and are the predominant type
in wild-type ATTR and most hATTR. Type B fibrils consist
only of full-length TTR and are found in some patients with
V30M ATTR and have been reported with the T114C
mutation (34). The fibril type in V30M determines the clin￾ical phenotype. Patients with type A are characterized by
late-onset (age . 50 y) disease with a mixture of neuropathy
and cardiomyopathy. Patients with type B have early-onset
disease that has a predominantly neuropathic phenotype.
Geographic clustering occurs, with early-onset (third de￾cade) disease prevalent in Portugal, Japan, and Brazil, and a
mixture of early- and late-onset disease (fifth to sixth decades)
common in Sweden (35). Individual patients with hATTR
display only one type of fibril, which does not change over
time (36). Type A fibrils are less avid for Congo red than type
B fibrils, a fact that may explain the lower yield of subcuta￾neous-fat-pad biopsies in wild-type ATTR (35).
Pilebro et al. reported that patients with type B fibrils
were 99mTc-DPD–negative, despite echocardiographic and,
in some patients, cardiac MR evidence of cardiac involvement
(37). A low sensitivity for 99mTc-DPD has also been reported
for ATTR because of the P64L mutation (38). Thus, calcification
alone cannot fully explain the affinity of bone-seeking tracers to
ATTR, and direct binding to fibrils cannot be excluded at this
time. However, these small studies did not confirm cardiac in￾volvement by biopsy and, therefore, are far from conclusive.
KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
With the advent of effective treatment options for ATTR
amyloidosis, a critical need has emerged for an imaging test
to monitor disease activity by serial imaging. All current
imaging approaches have limitations in this regard, including
scintigraphy with bone-seeking tracers and cardiac MR
(39,40). With its superior ability to quantify tracer uptake,
PET-based tracers are being actively investigated for serial
imaging. An improved understanding of structure–function
relationships and binding mechanism will help in efforts to
develop new amyloid tracers.
Despite the transformative effects of scintigraphy on our
ability to diagnose ATTR CA, the global experience with
these tracers for the diagnosis of CA is still relatively small.
Its performance characteristics in the community setting (in
contrast to specialist centers with highly selected referral
populations) remain unexplored. Conditions other than CA
resulting in positive scintigraphy are being identified (e.g.,
hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity) (41). Binding mecha￾nisms and the effect of fibril type on tracer affinity need
to be clarified. Thus, whereas scintigraphy with the 99mTc
bone-seeking tracers is a remarkably useful test for patients
with suspected amyloidosis, vigilance is required to iden￾tify and further evaluate cases in which there is discordance
between clinical and imaging findings.
