Abstract
Background: Despite widespread interest in the use of virtual (ie, telephone and video) visits for ambulatory patient care during
the COVID-19 pandemic, studies examining their adoption during the pandemic by race, sex, age, or insurance are lacking.
Moreover, there have been limited evaluations to date of the impact of these sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone
versus video visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient
populations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and
telephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center.
Methods: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks
following the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in
2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus
virtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression.
Results: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081
vs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding
weeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2%
(n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person)
visits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial)
insurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or ≥75 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years),
and patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video
visits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men,
Black (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance.
Conclusions: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority
were by video. Sociodemographic differences existed in the use of virtual versus in-person and video versus telephone visits. To
ensure equitable care delivery, we present five policy recommendations to inform the further development of virtual visit programs
and their reimbursement.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the landscape
of health care delivery. One of the major changes resulting from
the pandemic has been the rapid adoption of virtual (ie,
telephone and video) visits and other telemedicine programs
that facilitate health care services via health care information
technologies to accommodate necessary reductions in in-person
care [1,2]. A major driver for this adoption was the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expansion of virtual visit
reimbursement on March 17, 2020, under the 1135 waiver
authority. This allowed for Medicare reimbursement of multiple
visit types performed virtually, including outpatient clinic visits,
retroactively starting March 6, 2020, and continuing for the
duration of the public health emergency [3]. This shift to
reimburse virtual visits helped clinicians continue caring for
patients despite widespread shelter-in-place orders and may
represent the beginning of a new era for ambulatory medicine.
Unfortunately, access to virtual visits may not be equitable in
the United States. Differential access to the internet and devices
and differences in health literacy may leave patients without
the ability to attend video visits. Thus, those patients may only
be able to participate in telephone visits if they are unable to
attend in-person visits. Surveys by the Pew Research Center in
2019 found lower rates of internet usage and smartphone
ownership among people ages ≥65 years compared to younger
adults [4,5]. When examining access to internet and internet
technology by race, Black adults had lower rates of access to
the internet and lower rates of desktop or laptop computer
ownership than White adults [4,6]. A recent study of Medicare
beneficiaries found that digital access was lowest among patients
who were ≥85 years, Black, or received Medicaid [7].
Additionally, adults who are older, men, and Black have been
shown to have lower health literacy levels than those who are
younger, women, and White; and low health literacy is
associated with a greater likelihood of needing help performing
online tasks [8-10]. These disparities in access to the internet
and devices and lower health literacy levels may lead to
corresponding disparities in health care delivery and quality,
particularly if the quality of health care visits and visit
satisfaction are greater with video visits compared to telephone
visits [11-13]. Furthermore, patients who opted out of virtual
visits entirely and continued to attend in-person visits during
the pandemic may have increased their risk of exposure to
COVID-19 or experienced decreased appointment availability
due to the decrease in in-person capacity required to maintain
COVID-19 social distancing. Thus, though virtual visits have
been considered an integral part of delivery of health care during
the pandemic, access to those visits (especially video visits)
may have been affected by underlying differences in access to
technology and health literacy.
There is already existing evidence that other recent innovations
in health care technology may exacerbate differences in health
care access. For example, patient portal use, which has the
potential to improve the quality and efficiency of health care
delivery, differs with respect to race, insurance, and
neighborhood broadband internet access [14]. One study found
that patient portal use was lower among Black (vs White)
patients; Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured (vs commercially
insured) patients; and patients with decreased neighborhood
broadband internet access [14]. Other studies using data prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic have additionally suggested that
telemedicine and patient-facing health information technology
utilization is lower among men, patients over 65 years,
non-White patients, patients without commercial insurance, and
patients living in neighborhoods with low internet access; this
lack of internet access and technology proficiency continues to
impede wider adoption of health information technology among
racial minorities and those without commercial insurance
[15-18]. Given prior research on the benefits of telemedicine
interventions on clinical outcomes, such as improvement in
glycemic control in medically underserved patients with
diabetes, these disparities in the use of and access to digital
health may directly translate into disparities in health care
quality [19].
Despite widespread interest in the use of virtual visits for
ambulatory patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, few
studies to date have evaluated the adoption of ambulatory virtual
visits during the pandemic by age, race, sex, or insurance [20].
The studies that have been published recently show that patients
using virtual visits during the pandemic were more likely to be
younger adults as compared to older adults, female, non-White,
and not commercially-insured [2,21-23]. This may be due in
part to the lack of patient readiness for virtual visits, which one
study found was more prevalent in patients who were older,
male, or Black, and affected video visits more than telephone
visits [24]. However, most of the studies published on data from
the pandemic did not evaluate the impact of these
sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video
virtual visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify,
understand, and address differences in care delivery across
patient populations, and inform policy decisions, particularly
those like reimbursement rules, which could affect access to or
quality of care.
In this study, we aimed to (1) assess changes in visit volume,
type, and patient sociodemographics from the start of the
COVID-19 national emergency to the end of May 2020,
compared to the same weeks in 2019; and (2) elucidate
differences in the use of ambulatory virtual visits (as compared
to in-person visits) and, for those using virtual visits, the use of
video visits (compared to telephone visits) by age, sex, race,
and insurance. We hypothesize that (1) total visit volumes
decreased and virtual visits increased during the COVID-19
pandemic, while patient sociodemographics remained similar
between the two time periods; and (2) patients who utilized
in-person visits during the COVID-19 study period were more

likely to be younger than patients who utilized virtual visits,
and of those using virtual visits, patients utilizing video visits
were more likely to be younger, White, and have commercial
insurance than patients utilizing telephone visits [2,21-23].
Methods
Setting
The University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) is the
flagship institution of University of Chicago Medicine, and
includes 5 multispecialty faculty ambulatory practice sites in
Chicago, IL, and the surrounding area, with over 600,000
encounters per year. UCMC began offering virtual visits in
March 2020 in response to the widespread shelter-in-place
orders at the city, state, and regional level due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Telephone visits began during the week of March
15, 2020. Video visits began with a pilot program in the
hematology/oncology, pediatrics, psychiatry, gastroenterology,
and obstetrics/gynecology practices on March 26, 2020,
followed by a broad roll-out to all ambulatory faculty clinics
on April 6, 2020. All practices used a HIPAA (Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant Zoom platform
to enable video visits, which was not integrated into the
institution’s electronic health record system (Epic) during the
evaluated time period.
Immediately after the City of Chicago and State of Illinois
shelter-in-place orders were enacted, patients with previously
scheduled in-person office visits were contacted and given the
option to either reschedule or convert their appointment to a
virtual visit. If a patient agreed to a virtual visit, a video visit
was encouraged. Patients scheduled for video visits were sent
the following through the patient portal or email: a Zoom link
for the video visit; a brief prevideo visit checklist followed by
more detailed instructions describing the technical requirements
to participate in the video visit; and a link to a video highlighting
methods to best prepare for the video visit and a demonstration
of what to expect. If the patient was unable or unwilling to
participate in a video visit, a telephone visit was scheduled, and
they were told to expect a call from their provider at the
scheduled appointment time. Patients reaching out to schedule
new virtual visits were also preferentially offered video visits
but were given the opportunity to schedule a telephone visit as
well in accordance with their preferences. The availability of
virtual visits was marketed widely to our patient population
through our patient portal, marketing emails, and our health
system’s internet home page. Beginning on May 1, 2020,
patients were given the option to begin self-scheduling video
visits (but not telephone visits) through the patient portal.
Study Population and Measures
All adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits occurring in
UCMC faculty practice locations from March 15 to May 31,
2019, and March 15 to May 31, 2020, were included. The type
of outpatient clinic visit was classified as in-person or virtual,
and virtual visits were further classified as telephone or video,
based on the scheduled visit type for all completed visits. Patient
sociodemographic data were examined for each visit, including
age, sex, race, and insurance. Age was categorized into 5 groups:
0-17 years, 18-45 years, 46-64 years, 65-74 years, and ≥75
years. Patients were grouped into 3 racial categories: White,
Black, and other (which included Asian/Mideast Indian,
American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other
Pacific Islander, more than one race, patient declined, and
unknown). Insurance was categorized as Medicare (including
Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative), Medicaid,
commercial, or other. The data were extracted from the
institution’s electronic health record data warehouse. This
project received a formal determination of Quality Improvement
according to institutional policy. As such, this initiative was not
reviewed by the Institutional Review Board.
Statistical Analysis
First, we used descriptive statistics to examine weekly and
overall visit volumes during the study period, which were the
11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency
declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020), compared to visit
volumes in the corresponding weeks of the 2019 calendar year.
Next, we examined visit type (in-person, video, telephone) and
patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) associated
with the visit and compared these characteristics to those visits
occurring during the same date range in 2019. Last, we
examined differences in ambulatory visit type (in-person vs
virtual; and for those with virtual visits, video vs telephone) by
patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits
occurring during the COVID-19 study period.
Data were summarized with chi-square tests where appropriate.
Because of the large sample size, statistical significance was
set at P≤.001. To estimate the association between patient
sociodemographics and visit type (in-person vs virtual, and
video vs phone for those with virtual visits), we performed
logistic regression. Results were similar between unadjusted
and adjusted analyses; only adjusted analyses are presented.
Data were analyzed using RStudio, version 3.6.3 (RStudio,
PBC).
Results
Visit Volumes and Visit Types
In the week of March 15-21, 2020, the ambulatory visit volume
dropped to 34% of visit volumes when compared to the same
week in 2019 (n=4877 vs n=14,343 visits) and reached a nadir
of 20.8% of 2019 levels (n=2476 vs n=11,930 visits) in the
following week. By the week of May 24-30, 2020, the
ambulatory visit volume had rebounded to 81.8% of the volume
of the same week in 2019 (n=9451 vs n=11,554 visits). Total
visit volumes from March 15 to May 31, 2020, were 51.4% of
2019 volumes (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits).
Virtual ambulatory visits increased from 0 to 48,475 visits
between March 15 to May 31, 2020, and comprised 60.5% of
total ambulatory visit volume, with the remaining 39.5%
(n=31,606) conducted in person (Table 1 and Figure 1). Among
virtual visits performed during the study period, 61.2%
(n=29,661) were by video and 38.8% (n=18,814) were by
telephone. For comparison, in 2019, there were no virtual visits
for the same time period. Patient sociodemographics were
similar for those with ambulatory visits between March 15 to
May 31, 2020, and the corresponding weeks in 2019 (Table 1).

Association Between Ambulatory Visit Type (In-Person
vs Virtual) and Patient Sociodemographics
In unadjusted analyses, there were statistically significant
differences between those who received in-person and virtual
visits for all sociodemographics examined (Table 1). In adjusted
analyses, virtual visits were less likely than in-person visits for
patients aged 0-17 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% CI
0.68-0.75), 65-74 years (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84), and ≥75
years (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91), compared to patients aged
18-45 years (Table 1). Men were less likely (OR 0.88, 95% CI
0.85-0.90) to attend a virtual visit than women. There was no
difference in the odds of virtual visit attendance between White
and Black patients; however, patients with race categorized as
other were more likely to attend a virtual visit (OR 1.22, 95%
CI 1.16-1.28) compared to White patients. Medicare patients
were more likely (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.21-1.34) than patients
with commercial insurance to attend virtual visits (vs in-person
visits), whereas patients with Medicaid insurance were less
likely (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77) than patients with
commercial insurance to have virtual visits. Patients with
insurance categorized as other were also less likely to have a
virtual visit (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24) than patients with
commercial insurance.
Association Between Virtual Visit Type (Telephone vs
Video) and Patient Sociodemographics for Those With
Virtual Visits
In unadjusted analyses, there were statistically significant
differences across all sociodemographics examined except sex
between those using telephone versus video visits (Table 2). In
adjusted analyses, results were similar, except there were
differences by sex as well. Video visits were more likely than
telephone visits for patients aged 0-17 years (OR 3.32, 95% CI
3.01-3.67), while video visits were less likely than telephone
visits for patients aged 46-64 years (OR 0.56, 95% CI
0.54-0.60), 65-74 years (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.44-0.50), and ≥75
years (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.27-0.32), compared to patients aged
18-45 years. Men were less likely to attend a video visit (OR
0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.97) than women. Black patients were less
likely to attend a video visit (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.52-0.57)
compared to White patients. Video visits were less likely than
telephone visits for Medicare patients (OR 0.69, 95% CI
0.65-0.74) and Medicaid patients (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.67-0.77)
compared to patients with commercial insurance.

Discussion
Principal Findings
Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period were
approximately half of that in 2019, although patient
sociodemographics were similar. Recovery of clinic volumes
after the escalation of the pandemic was largely driven by virtual
ambulatory care, which comprised over 60% (n=48,475) of total
ambulatory clinic volumes from March 15 through May 31,
2020, a majority of which were video visits. Children, adults
≥65 years, men, and patients with Medicaid coverage were less
likely to have virtual visits, whereas patients with Medicare
coverage were more likely to have virtual visits compared to
patients with commercial insurance coverage. For those who
attended virtual visits, children were more likely to have video
visits, while adults ≥46 years, men, Black patients, and patients
with Medicare or Medicaid coverage were less likely to have
video visits.
The sociodemographic differences in virtual visits we identified
are in line with prior research. For example, prior research found
that women were more likely than men to shelter in place due
to concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection for themselves
and their family; this would make virtual visits a more appealing
visit type for women [25]. Additionally, studies prior to the
pandemic demonstrated that women used virtual visits more
often than men [11]. Similarly, patients with Medicare insurance
may have been more concerned about acquiring COVID-19
infection and prefer to shelter in place, leading to their increased
likelihood of attending a virtual visit. In contrast, pediatric well
visits (and well visits for most non-Medicare beneficiaries) must
still be performed in person to be reimbursed; therefore, many
pediatric patients continued to attend in-person visits even
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sociodemographic differences in virtual (vs in-person) visits
and video (vs telephone) visits illustrate the digital divide [26].
The patient populations with lower levels of access to internet
and smart devices and lower digital literacy were the same
sociodemographic groups found in our study to have a lower
likelihood of completing virtual or video visits, including older
adults, Black patients, and patients without commercial
insurance [4-9]. Our results also match prior studies on virtual
visit use during the pandemic, which found that patients using
virtual visits during the pandemic were more likely to be

include internet, a capable device, and a basic level of digital
literacy, so patients who do not have all three (or do not have
a readily available family member to assist) are unable to attend
video visits. One study performed during the pandemic found
higher prevalence of “unreadiness” to attend video visits in
those sociodemographic groups found to be less likely to attend
video visits, including patients who were older, Black, and men,
similar to our findings [24]. These findings raise concerns about
the role video visits may play in exacerbating existing health
inequities, particularly since the quality of health care visits and
visit satisfaction are greater with video visits compared to
telephone visits [11-13]. Moreover, these health disparities may
be significantly worsened if the current reimbursement parity
between telephone and video visits is discontinued, and
especially if telephone visits are no longer reimbursed altogether
following the public health emergency.
The shift in the delivery of ambulatory care through virtual
visits was incentivized by the new virtual reimbursement
policies from CMS and private insurance companies. The
significant contribution of virtual visits to overall ambulatory
visit volumes is likely to continue once the COVID-19 pandemic
has ended. The volume of virtual ambulatory visits at UCMC
has continued to grow even after the end of the study period,
indicating sustained interest in virtual visits likely due to
continued safety concerns related to the pandemic, ongoing
reimbursement for these services, and physician and patient
satisfaction with this new option for care delivery [27,28]. Given
the interest in and development of virtual visits prior to the
pandemic and the proliferation of virtual visits during the
pandemic, virtual visits for ambulatory care are likely to remain
popular among both patients and providers even after the
COVID-19 pandemic [1,2]. University of Chicago Medicine’s
2025 Strategic Vision (developed prior to the pandemic)
includes an “aim to build a digitally enabled organization for
patients” and a goal to expand access to care, both of which are
aided by the expansion of virtual visit services [29]. However,
if reimbursement for virtual visits is discontinued or significantly
reduced after the pandemic or public health emergency ends,
many medical centers are likely to stop making significant
investments in the continued development of their telemedicine
programs and the availability of virtual visits for patients would
be expected to decline.
Recommendations
The results of this study and our review of the virtual visit
landscape has prompted us to offer five recommendations
(Textbox 1). First, given the differences in virtual visit use by
certain sociodemographic groups demonstrated in this study
and the lower effective reimbursement rates for telephone visits
compared to video visits, medical institutions like UCMC with
high proportions of older, Black, and/or Medicare/Medicaid
patients may experience lower reimbursement rates because of
the barriers these groups face to completing video visits. For a
video visit, providers can bill for all time spent on patient care
on the encounter date, including documentation; for a telephone
visit, they can only bill for time spent in direct communication
(on the telephone call) with a patient on the encounter date. To
avoid effectively penalizing medical institutions providing care
to vulnerable populations, government and commercial insurers
should help address these disparities by maintaining
reimbursement parity between video and telephone visits.
Second, given the rapid growth and early success of virtual
visits, and the role they will likely play in blended models of
care, legislation that makes virtual visit reimbursement
permanent is essential to allow for the long-term investment by
health care systems and providers needed to improve the virtual
visit infrastructure and experience. Third, government insurers
and specialty societies should collaborate to establish guidance
to help distinguish ambulatory care best suited for virtual versus
in-person care. Fourth, quality improvement initiatives should
be undertaken at medical institutions to support and improve
access to and usability of video visits in populations
encountering the greatest barriers to its use. Last, advocacy for
policy changes and more universal broadband access are
essential to help close the digital divide experienced by our
most vulnerable patient populations, which would help address
the differential access to virtual visits described in this study.

1. Maintain reimbursement parity between video and telephone visits
2. Pass legislation making virtual visit reimbursement permanent
3. Establish guidance to distinguish ambulatory care best suited for virtual versus in-person care
4. Perform quality improvement initiatives to improve access to and usability of video visits in vulnerable populations
5. Advocate for policy changes and universal broadband access to close the digital divide
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, this study only examined a
single medical center and was a retrospective analysis; despite
this, the diversity of the patient population examined in our
study enabled our analysis of ambulatory virtual visit use.
Second, our study only examined a limited set of variables,
which were used as surrogates for the social determinants of
health described in this paper, such as access to broadband
internet, health literacy, tech literacy, education, and income,
and did not examine virtual and video visit use by ethnicity due
to limited data availability. Third, this area of clinical practice
and study is rapidly changing and will likely continue to change
rapidly over the next few months to years. Further studies at
other medical institutions should be conducted to confirm our
findings and examine additional sociodemographic variables.
Future analyses of ambulatory virtual visits should also
investigate patient satisfaction and outcomes by patient visit

type (eg, new, return, consult), given the differences in
reimbursement by visit type category, and whether ambulatory
virtual visits increase the geographic area served by academic
medical centers or medical institutions with subspecialty care,
as already suggested by limited data [30].
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the health
care delivery landscape largely due to the growth of ambulatory
virtual visits, which have rapidly become a vital component of
health care delivery. Given the differential use of these
technologies by age, sex, race, and insurance, these changes
also risk perpetuating and even exacerbating existing disparities
in health care access and quality, especially if reimbursement
policies do not sufficiently account for these differences and
the digital divide remains unaddressed.
