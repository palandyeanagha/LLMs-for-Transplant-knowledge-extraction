Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: Pathophysiology
and Treatment
Wissam Saliba, MD, and Boutros El-Haddad, MD
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a frequently encountered problem in the management of patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Its pathophysiology is mainly due to hyperphosphatemia and vita￾min D deficiency and resistance. This condition has a high impact on the mortality and morbidity of di￾alysis patients. Early diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is crucial in the management of pa￾tients with CKD. The treatment remains a challenge for patients and their clinicians. It should include a
combination of dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, and calcimi￾metics. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2009;22:574 –581.)
Background
The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
the United States has increased from 10% during
1988 to 1994 to around 13% during 1999 to 2004.
This goes in pair with an increasing prevalence of
diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current classi￾fication of CKD is based on the presence of paren￾chymal damage for stages I and II and a decrease in
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) regardless of pa￾renchymal damage for stages III and higher1 (Table
1). CKD stage III is the most common CKD stage,
with a rate reaching 30% in patients older than 70
years of age.2 This high number of CKD patients
represents a challenge for both nephrologists and
primary care physicians, especially when dealing
with blood pressure, anemia, volume status, and,
most importantly, the combination of secondary
hyperparathyroidism and mineral bone disease.
This article reviews the mechanisms and causes of
secondary hyperparathyroidism and provides a
stepped approach for its management.
Calcium and Phosphorus Homeostasis
The homeostasis of calcium and phosphorus is the
result of complex relations between calcemia, phos￾phatemia, and different hormones and factors
working synergistically to keep a normal balance of
these minerals (Fig. 1).
Parathyroid Hormone
The parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most im￾portant regulator of calcium metabolism. It is a
polypeptide consisting of 84 amino acids and is
secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid glands
in response to hypocalcemia and hyperphos￾phatemia. It has a short half-life (2 to 4 minutes)
before being degraded to various inactive frag￾ments. Although “intact” PTH assay is widely used
to estimate active PTH level, it may react with
some of its fragments. New assays, called “whole”
PTH, have been recently developed for better mea￾surement of full-length PTH.3 PTH acts mainly on
2 organs: the bone and the kidney.
1. It stimulates the osteoclasts and causes bone
resorption, resulting in an increase in the serum
concentration of calcium and phosphorus.
2. PTH stimulates the 1- hydroxylase activity in
the kidney, resulting in an increase in 1,25 di￾hydroxyvitamin D production. It also increases
the reabsorption of calcium in the distal renal
tubules, decreasing calcium clearance. The ef￾fect on phosphorus clearance is the opposite.
PTH can decrease the reabsorption of phospho￾rus in the proximal renal tubules from 85% in
healthy individuals to less than 15% in dialysis
patients.4
3. Of note, PTH has no direct established activity
on the intestine. However, it indirectly increases
intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption

via stimulation of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D pro￾duction. The results of high PTH are hypercal￾cemia, hypophosphatemia, and high urinary cal￾cium and phosphorus.
4. Calcium has a negative feedback effect on the
parathyroid glands through the calcium sensing
receptor.5 Recently, phosphorus has been shown
to have a direct stimulatory effect on the para￾thyroid glands.6
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is an essential factor in the regulation of
calcium and phosphorus balance. It is synthesized
in the skin but is also present in the diet. The active
form is 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. Its main action is
to enhance the availability of calcium and phospho￾rus for new bone formation. Recent studies have
also shown important actions of vitamin D in many
other tissues. Vitamin D enhances the intestinal
absorption of calcium and phosphorus, increasing
their serum levels.
1. Along with PTH, vitamin D is a required factor
in the bone resorption process.
2. It also increases the reabsorption of urinary cal￾cium and phosphorus in the renal tubules.
3. Through the vitamin D receptors it has a direct
effect on the parathyroid glands to suppress
PTH secretion.7
Fibroblasts Growth Factor-23
Until recently, it was thought that the phosphorus
homeostasis was mainly achieved by PTH and vi￾tamin D. Recent studies identified fibroblasts
growth factor (FGF)-23 as a new protein with
phosphaturic activity. It is mainly secreted by os￾teocytes and is now considered to be the most
important factor for regulation of phosphorus ho￾meostasis.
1. Through the Klotho receptor it acts mainly on
the kidney to increase phosphorus clearance.8
2. FGF-23 also inhibits the 1- hydoxylase activ￾ity, causing a low 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level.
3. Hyperphosphatemia is the principal stimulator
for FGF-23.
4. It is not yet proven if there is any direct relation
between PTH and FGF-23.
Calcium and Phosphorus Metabolism in
Renal Failure
When GFR falls, the phosphorus clearance de￾creases significantly, leading to phosphorus reten￾tion. This hyperphosphatemia, subclinical when es￾timated GFR is 30 mL/min, is thought to be the
principal cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism
(Fig. 2). Phosphorus induces PTH secretion by 3
mechanisms:
1. Direct stimulatory effect on the parathyroid
glands as previously mentioned.
2. Induction of mild hypocalcemia by precipitating
with calcium as CaHPO4. Hypocalcemia also
results from decreased calcium release from
bone pools.
3. Stimulation of FGF-23, which leads to severe
inhibition of 1- hydroxylase and depressed
level of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D.9 The down￾regulation of the vitamin D receptors on the

parathyroid glands leads to vitamin D resistance.
The loss of negative feedback on the parathy￾roid glands causes a high PTH level.
PTH secretion is appropriate in this case and,
along with FGF-23, can decrease the tubular reab￾sorption of phosphorus to 15%. This is a relatively
steady state: the phosphorus and calcium levels are
back to normal but at the expense of high PTH and
FGF-23. When GFR falls below 30 mL/min (CKD
stage IV), the tubular reabsorption of phosphorus
cannot be further lowered, causing more PTH and
FGF-23 secretion. Even though tubular reabsorption
of phosphorus is maximally suppressed, there are too
few nephrons left to balance the continuing phospho￾rus intake. Although PTH is no more active on the
kidney, its action on the bone is maintained and con￾tinues to promote calcium and phosphorus release.
The end result is a vicious cycle in which high phos￾phorus causes PTH secretion and PTH causes more
hyperphosphatemia.
Outcomes
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a very early dis￾ease and its diagnosis and treatment is crucial in the
management of patients with CKD. Levin et al10
demonstrated that the PTH starts to increase as
early as the beginning of CKD stage III (estimated
GFR, 60 mL/min), along with normal levels of
serum calcium and phosphorus.
The effect of secondary hyperparathyroidism on
mortality was thought to be mainly caused by hy￾perphosphatemia. The last phase of the Dialysis
Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study identified
hyperphosphatemia (PO4  6.1 mg/dL), hypercal￾cemia (Ca  10 mg/dL), and high PTH (600
pg/mL) as 3 independent risk factors for all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality, with hazard ratios of
1.18, 1.16, and 1.21, respectively.11 Moreover, it is
known that a calcium-phosphorus product 72
mg2
/dL2 is associated with a 34% increased risk of
mortality and metastatic calcification. This risk fur￾ther increases by 11% for every 10 points of eleva￾tion of the calcium-phosphorus product.12
In addition, secondary hyperparathyroidism is
the leading cause of renal osteodystrophy and bone
disease. Renal osteodystrophy is sometimes called
“the silent crippler”; affected patients may be com￾pletely asymptomatic. Symptoms, including bone
and joint pain and bone deformation and fractures,
are more frequent during the late stages of the
disease. Osteitis fibrosa cystica, the classic and
former most common osteodystrophy, is mainly
caused by high bone turnover secondary to high
levels of circulating PTH. The excessive suppres￾sion of PTH can lead to adynamic bone disease
(currently the most common osteodystrophy),
mainly because of low bone turnover.13 In fact,
during the late stages of CKD, the number of PTH
receptors in the skeleton is downregulated, leading
to what is known as skeletal resistance, a natural
mechanism for the bone to defend itself against the
high levels of PTH. This is why the current Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI)
recommendation is to keep PTH between 150 and
300 pg/mL to avoid a complete suppression of the
osteoclasts and prevent adynamic bone disease. An￾other less common bone disorder caused by low
bone turnover and vitamin D deficiency is osteo￾malacia, which is primarily characterized by an in￾creased volume of unmineralized bone. Mixed os￾teodystrophy is also described as having elements
of both high and low bone turnovers. Even though
many patients have a predominant form of bone
disease, most patients have several types and there￾fore fall into the mixed category.
Management
The management of secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism should be started at the beginning of CKD
stage III (estimated GFR, 60 mL/min). It is a
complex process that requires good communication
between the nephrologist, the dietitian, and the
patient. It is important to recognize the treatment

goals, which vary according to the stages of CKD.
Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and intact
PTH should be measured in all patients with CKD
and estimated GFR 60 mL/min. The National
Kidney Foundation K/DOQI guidelines provide
frequency of measurements and goals for serum
phosphorus and PTH according to CKD stage,
listed below14 (Table 2). The treatment of second￾ary hyperparathyroidism basically consists of a low
phosphorus diet, phosphate binders, vitamin D de￾rivatives, calcimimetics, and even parathyroidec￾tomy.
Stepped Approach
The management of secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism can be divided in 3 main steps (Table 3):
1. The goal of the first step is to optimize the levels
of serum phosphorus and calcium (within the
recommended ranges, depending on stage of
CKD). This can be achieved by dietary restric￾tion and the initiation of phosphate binders (cal￾cium acetate, sevelamer, or lanthanum). In
CKD stages III and IV, ergocalciferol should be
considered if the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is
30 ng/mL.
2. Step 2 should focus on the control of PTH and
vitamin D levels by the use of calcimimetics
and/or vitamin D analogues. If calcium and
phosphorus levels are close to the upper limit of
normal, then cinacalcet should be considered.
On the other hand, at calcium levels closer to
the lower limit of normal, vitamin D analogues
would be a better choice.
3. In step 3, the doses of phosphate binders, calci￾mimetics, and vitamin D analogues should be
adjusted to achieve the K/DOQI values.
Low-Phosphorus Diet
For patients with CKD stages III and IV (level B),
a low-phosphorus diet should be initiated when
serum phosphorus is above 4.6 mg/dL and when
serum phosphorous is above 5.5 mg/dL in patients
with CKD stage V (level A), or when the measured
intact PTH is above the target range of the CKD
stage, even with normal levels of phosphorus and
calcium (level A). Unfortunately, this is very diffi￾cult to achieve because phosphorus is omnipresent
in our diet. In fact, the dietary phosphorus is mainly
derived from 2 sources: dietary proteins and phos￾phorus additives. These additives are an important
component of processed foods such as meats,

They can increase the dietary phosphorus intake by
as much as 1 g/day.15 Nutrient composition tables
usually do not include the phosphorus additives,
which results in underestimation of phosphorus
intake. Moreover, the phosphorus derived from
plants is in the form of phytate and is less absorb￾able by the human intestines because of a lack of
the enzyme phytase. Table 4 illustrates the phos￾phorus content of some common foods that contain
protein.
In a study of 29,076 patients on hemodialysis,
Shinaberger et al16 demonstrated that a high-pro￾tein/low-phosphorus diet is associated with the best
survival, and the highest mortality rate was found in
patients on low-protein/low-phosphorus diet. This
study reflects the effect of dietary proteins on the
survival of patients on hemodialysis. The current
K/DOQI guidelines for patients with CKD are to
restrict dietary phosphorus to 800 to 1000 mg/day,
adjusted for dietary protein needs.14
Phosphate Binders
Phosphate binders are the mainstay of therapy for
secondary hyperparathyroidism. The noncompli￾ance to dietary restriction as well as the need to
ensure adequate protein intake often result in the
addition of phosphate binders to limit the net ab￾sorption of dietary phosphorus. In a recent study
published in December 2008, patients treated with
phosphate binders during the first 90 days after
starting dialysis had a 30% lower risk of death
compared with those who were not treated.17 Sev￾eral modalities have been tried, including alumi￾num hydroxide, calcium salts, sevelamer hydro￾chloride (Renagel, Genzyme Corp., Cambridge,
MA) and lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol, Shire
US, Inc., Wayne, PA).
Aluminum Hydroxide
It is the former phosphate binder of choice and the
oldest treatment for hyperphosphatemia. It forms
nonabsorbable aluminum-phosphorus precipitates
in the intestines and is very effective in lowering
phosphatemia levels. It is still the most potent
phosphate binder. Aluminum hydroxide should be
prescribed by nephrologists and its use should be
limited to a short period of time because of the risk
of aluminum toxicity. In fact, the accumulation of
aluminum in the body leads to severe refractory
microcytic anemia, dementia, osteomalacia, and
other problems. There is no known safe dose to
avoid aluminum intoxication. In patients with se￾rum phosphorus levels of 7.0 mg/dL, the current
K/DOQI guidelines advise the use of aluminum
hydroxide for 4 weeks and for one course only.14
Calcium Salts
The 2 most commonly used calcium salts in the
United States are calcium carbonate (eg, Tums,
GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC)
and calcium acetate (eg, PhosLo, Nabi Biopharma￾ceuticals, Rockville, MD). They bind to dietary
phosphorus and form a nonabsorbable precipitate
in the intestines. Calcium acetate is twice as potent
as calcium carbonate and induces less hypercalce￾mia.18 Calcium acetate contains only 169 mg of
elemental calcium versus 200 to 600 mg in calcium
carbonate. This is important to know when dealing
with hypercalcemia induced by calcium salts, a ma￾jor complication that limits the use of calcium salts.
The K/DOQI guidelines currently recommend a
total dose of elemental calcium 1.5 g/day14
(equivalent to 9 tablets of PhosLo [Nabi Biophar￾maceuticals]). Calcium salts are contraindicated in
patients with serum calcium levels of 10.5 mg/dL
and in patients with persistently elevated phospho￾rus and adynamic bone disease.

Sevelamer Hydrochloride
Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel, Genzyme
Corp.) was approved by the Food and Drug Ad￾ministration in 2000 for the treatment of hyper￾phosphatemia in patients with CKD. It is noncal￾cium, nonaluminum, and nonmagnesium based. It
forms a cationic polymer that binds to dietary phos￾phorus through ion exchange. Studies have proved
the efficacy of sevelamer and currently it is widely
used in the United States. Sevelamer is 10 times
more expensive than calcium-based phosphate
binders. Several studies have evaluated its relative
efficacy compared with calcium-based products.
In the treat-to-goal trial, patients using sevel￾amer had less incidence of hypercalcemia, lower
low-density lipoprotein levels, and lesser degrees of
calcification in the coronary arteries.19 The Dialy￾sis Clinical Outcomes Revisited Trial is one of the
most important trials that compared calcium ace￾tate and sevelamer. It included 2107 patients fol￾lowed for 45 months and showed no difference in
mortality between the 2 groups.20 Further pre￾specified analysis showed a decrease in all-cause—
but not cardiovascular—mortality among patients
65 years of age who were assigned to sevelamer.
This study was followed by a meta-analysis that
reported no difference in all-cause mortality be￾tween the 2 groups.21
Sevelamer Carbonate
A side effect of sevelamer is the induction of met￾abolic acidosis. This has led to the replacement of
chloride ion with a carbonate. The new product is
sevelamer carbonate, or Renvela (Genzyme Corp.).
It was approved in December 2007. Sevelamer car￾bonate has the same efficacy as sevelamer hydro￾chloride but with less metabolic acidosis and there￾fore less adverse gastrointestinal effects.22
Lanthanum Carbonate (Fosrenol, Shire US, Inc.)
Lanthanum is a rare earth element and has the
property of phosphorus binding. It was approved
by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004. It is
effective in lowering serum phosphorus level, but is
also very expensive. Moreover, its long-term safety
needs to be determined, particularly regarding its
possible accumulation in the liver, kidney, or other
organs. In a study of 1359 hemodialysis patients
assigned to lanthanum or prestudy standard ther￾apy and followed for 2 years, Finn23 found similar
efficacy in controlling hyperphosphatemia but with
fewer incidences of hypercalcemia and better PTH
control in patients receiving lanthanum. A similar
study was done among patients with CKD stages
III and IV, comparing lanthanum versus placebo.
That study also showed better outcomes in the
lanthanum-treated group.24
Conclusions
To help clarify the use of this wide variety of
phosphate binders, the K/DOQI guidelines are as
follows14:
1. All phosphate-binding agents are effective in
lowering serum phosphorus levels (level A) and
may be used as the primary therapy (except
those that are aluminum or magnesium based
[level B]).
2. If needed, a combination of 2 can be used (level
B).
3. Calcium-based binders should be avoided when
Ca is 10.5 mg/dL (level A).
4. Elemental calcium provided by the calcium￾based phosphate binders should not exceed 1500
mg/day (level B).
Vitamin D and Its Derivatives
Vitamin D is one of the oldest treatments for sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism. It is known that cal￾citriol deficiency and resistance are major contrib￾utors to the pathophysiology of the disease and that
calcitriol supplementation is effective in suppress￾ing high levels of PTH. On the other hand, calcit￾riol enhances the intestinal absorption of calcium
and phosphorus, increasing their blood levels and
possibly increasing their product. Several observa￾tional studies have shown improved survival in pa￾tients treated with intravenous vitamin D, but ran￾domized controlled studies to confirm survival
benefits are still lacking. In fact, a meta-analysis
done in 2007 showed no difference in mortality,
bone pain, vascular calcifications, or rate of para￾thyroidectomies between patients treated with vi￾tamin D compounds and those who received pla￾cebo.25 Calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) is the
natural form of vitamin D produced by the human
body. Studies have shown that intermittent, intra￾venous administration of calcitriol is more effective
than daily oral calcitriol in lowering serum PTH
levels.26 Several forms of vitamin D and its deriv￾atives are available on the market:

Ergocalciferol
Ergocalciferol (eg, lin) (Eli Lilly and Company,
Indianapolis, IN) is vitamin D2 or the nutritional
vitamin D. To be active, it needs to be metabolized
in the liver and the kidneys, which would require at
least some activity of the 1- hydroxylase. Re￾cently, it has been recognized that low levels of
25-hydroxyvitamin D—and not only of the vitamin
D active form (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D)— can
contribute to the development of secondary hyper￾parathyroidism.27 Ergocalciferol is only indicated
in patients with CKD stages III and IV if the
25-hydroxyvitamin D level is 30 ng/mL. There is
currently inadequate evidence to support the ben￾efits of ergocalciferol use in dialysis patients (CKD
stage V).
Selective Vitamin D Analogues
The problem with the increased intestinal absorp￾tion of calcium and phosphorus after administra￾tion of cacitriol led to the development of selective
agents that have more affinity to the kidney rather
than intestinal receptors. These second-generation
agents cause less hypercalcemia and hyperphos￾phatemia than traditional calcitriol. Two agents are
available and widely used in the United States:
paricalcitol (eg, Zemplar, Abbott Laboratories, Ab￾bott Park, IL) and doxercalciferol (Hectorol, Gen￾zyme Corp.). In a large study including 69,492
patients undergoing dialysis in Fresenius facilities,
patients treated with paricalcitol had a 16% lower
mortality rate than those who received calcitriol, in
addition to lower levels of calcemia and phos￾phatemia and a better PTH control.28
Conclusions
The K/DOQI guidelines regarding vitamin D use
in patients with CKD are as follows14:
1. Ergocalciferol should be used in CKD stages III
and IV when serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D is 30 ng/mL (level B).
2. Active oral vitamin D sterols (calcitriol, parical￾citol, or doxercalciferol) are indicated when se￾rum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 30
ng/mL with high PTH in CKD stages III and
IV (level A).
3. Active vitamin D sterols are indicated when Ca
is 9.5 mg/dL, PO4 is 5.5 mg/dL, and PTH is
300 pg/mL in CKD stage V (level A).
4. Intermittent intravenous use is more effective
than oral use in dialysis patients (level A).
Calcimimetics
Calcimimetics are new agents that allosterically in￾crease the sensitivity to calcium of calcium-sensing
receptors in the parathyroid glands, thus suppress￾ing PTH secretion. Cinacalcet (Sensipar, Amgen
Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) is the only Food and
Drug Administration-approved calcimimetic for
use in dialysis patients. It was introduced to the
market in 2004. In a study including 1136 hemo￾dialysis patients with PTH 300 pg/mL, patients
assigned to traditional therapy plus cinacalcet had
better achievement of the K/DOQI guidelines
(PTH 300 and calcium x phosphate 55) than
those who were assigned to traditional therapy plus
placebo (41% vs 6%).29 Cinacalcet may be used in
combination with vitamin D and is contraindicated
in patients with Ca levels 8.4 mg/dL. Its side
effects include gastrointestinal symptoms and QT
prolongation, mostly related to hypocalcemia. Ci￾nacalcet is indicated only in dialysis patients with
Ca levels 8.4 mg/dL and PTH levels 300 pg/
mL. Unfortunately, there is lack of studies address￾ing the use of cinacalcet in patients with CKD
stages III and IV.
Parathyroidectomy
This is only used when all medical therapy is un￾successful. Its efficacy is well documented.30 In ad￾dition, the presence of extraskeletal calcification,
calciphylaxis, debilitating bone disease, refractory
pruritus, severe hypercalcemia, and PTH levels
800 pg/mL are strong indications for surgical
treatment. It can be performed by either subtotal or
total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.
Small amounts of resected parathyroid tissue can be
autografted in the muscles of the forearm or neck,
as well as in the subcutaneous tissue of the chest or
abdomen. The lack of osteoclastic activity caused
by a decrease in PTH postoperatively may lead to a
precipitous fall in calcium levels, a condition called-
“hungry-bone syndrome.” This is why patient fol￾low-up after the surgery is extremely important and
should include monitoring of the total and ionized
calcium levels.
