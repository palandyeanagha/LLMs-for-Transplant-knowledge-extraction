Abstract
Background: Methylmalonic aciduria is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of
methylmalonate (MMA), propionate and 2-methylcitrate (2-MCA) in body fluids. Early diagnosis and current
treatment strategies aimed at limiting the production of these metabolites are only partially effective in preventing
neurological damage.
Methods: To explore the metabolic consequences of methylmalonic aciduria on the brain, we used 3D
organotypic brain cell cultures from rat embryos. We challenged the cultures at two different developmental stages
with 1 mM MMA, propionate or 2-MCA applied 6 times every 12 h. In a dose–response experiment cultures were
challenged with 0.01, 0.1, 0.33 and 1 mM 2-MCA. Immunohistochemical staining for different brain cell markers
were used to assess cell viability, morphology and differentiation. Significant changes were validated by western
blot analysis. Biochemical markers were analyzed in culture media. Apoptosis was studied by immunofluorescence
staining and western blots for activated caspase-3.
Results: Among the three metabolites tested, 2-MCA consistently produced the most pronounced effects. Exposure
to 2-MCA caused morphological changes in neuronal and glial cells already at 0.01 mM. At the biochemical level
the most striking result was a significant ammonium increase in culture media with a concomitant glutamine
decrease. Dose–response studies showed significant and parallel changes of ammonium and glutamine starting
from 0.1 mM 2-MCA. An increased apoptosis rate was observed by activation of caspase-3 after exposure to at least
0.1 mM 2-MCA.
Conclusion: Surprisingly, 2-MCA, and not MMA, seems to be the most toxic metabolite in our in vitro model
leading to delayed axonal growth, apoptosis of glial cells and to unexpected ammonium increase. Morphological
changes were already observed at 2-MCA concentrations as low as 0.01 mM. Increased apoptosis and ammonium
accumulation started at 0.1 mM thus suggesting that ammonium accumulation is secondary to cell suffering and/or
cell death. Local accumulation of ammonium in CNS, that may remain undetected in plasma and urine, may
therefore play a key role in the neuropathogenesis of methylmalonic aciduria both during acute decompensations
and in chronic phases. If confirmed in vivo, this finding might shift the current paradigm and result in novel
therapeutic strategies.

Background
Methylmalonic acidurias (MMAurias) are a genetically
heterogeneous group of inborn errors of metabolism
characterized by the excretion of methylmalonic acid
(MMA) in urine. Besides MMA, propionic acid (PA) and
2-methylcitric acid (2-MCA) accumulate in tissues and
body fluids. Isolated MMAuria is caused by defects of
the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
(MCM, EC 5.4.99.2) or in the synthesis of its cofactor
5’-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). MCM is a key
enzyme of the catabolic pathway of the amino acids
L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-methionine and L-threonine,
as well as of odd-chain fatty acids and the side chain
of cholesterol [1]. MCM is encoded by the MUT gene
(MIM *609058). Genetic mutations of the MUT gene
cause MMAuria (MIM #251000) with either partial (mut-
)
or complete (mut0
) enzyme deficiency [2]. The cblA type
of MMAuria due to a defect in AdoCbl synthesis is caused
by mutations in the MMAA gene encoding a protein of
unknown function (MIM *607481) [3] and the cblB variant
by mutations in the MMAB gene encoding cobalamin
adenosyltransferase (MIM *607568) [4]. CblA and cblB var￾iants are responsive to cobalamin supplementation [3,4].
The age of onset is variable. Most of the patients present
with an acute life-threatening metabolic crisis in the first
years of life, which is usually precipitated by catabolic stress
(e.g. intercurrent illness). The leading clinical sign during
crisis is vomiting, followed by lethargy and coma, while the
biochemical profile is characterized by metabolic acidosis,
hyperammonemia, hyperglycinemia and hypoglycemia [5].
Late onset forms with chronic progressive disease are
also known.
The therapeutic management consists of dietary treat￾ment (low protein diet) combined with carnitine and – in
responsive forms – cobalamin supplementation. Emer￾gency treatment aims to prevent or reverse a catabolic
state by means of high energy intake. It has recently been
shown that low protein diet and L-carnitine significantly
reduce urinary biomarkers of protein and lipid oxidative
damage [6]. Retrospective studies have shown that survival
and neurological outcome were unfavorable in patients
with an early onset and/or not responding to cobalamin
[7]. The overall survival rate has improved during the last
two decades, but the long-term outcome remains unsatis￾fying. Quality of life of affected patients is massively
impaired by neurological (extrapyramidal movement dis￾order, developmental delay) and renal (chronic renal fail￾ure) complications [8,9]. Despite newborn screening and
pre-symptomatic treatment of MMAuria in several coun￾tries, neurological complications remain significant in
affected patients.
Liver transplantation has been used to correct the enzym￾atic defect in MMAuria, the liver being considered the
main organ expressing the propionate catabolic pathway.
However, several reports of neurological deterioration after
liver transplantation can be found in the literature [8,10]. It
has been shown that MMA levels in CSF stay relatively
high even after liver transplantation, whereas they drop dra￾matically in blood and urine [11]. Since the catabolic path￾way of propionate metabolism is expressed in neurons of
the developing and adult CNS [12], liver transplantation
likely corrects the metabolic defect only in the periphery
while autonomous production of potentially neurotoxic
metabolites can still occur in CNS and can lead to neuro￾logic damage.
Different pathomechanistic concepts for brain damage
in MMAuria have been proposed: MMA was first consid￾ered as the main neurotoxic metabolite, whereas other
studies suggested toxic effects of propionyl-CoA and
2-MCA [13,14]. MMA has structural similarities with
known inhibitors of respiratory chain complex II and was
thought to be a mitochondrial toxin [15]. Toxic effects of
MMA on primary neuronal cultures and in rats after
intrastriatal administration have been demonstrated and
could be prevented by succinate, N-methyl-D-aspartate re￾ceptor antagonists and antioxidants [14]. MMA loading in
cultured rat striatal neurons resulted in intracellular accu￾mulation not only of MMA, but also of 2-MCA and
malonate [14]. Thus, impairment of energy metabolism
might be mediated by a synergistic inhibition of TCA cycle
and mitochondrial respiratory chain by 2-MCA, MMA and
propionyl-CoA [13]. A recent study on isolated rat brain
mitochondria demonstrated an inhibitory effect of MMA
on α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Measurements of
α-ketoglutarate transport and mitochondrial MMA accu￾mulation indicated that MMA/α-ketoglutarate exchange
depletes mitochondria from this substrate. The same group,
however, could not find any permanent defects on
mitochondrial respiration in isolated brain mitochondria
after intraperitoneal injection of MMA in young rats [16].
MMA provoked oxidative damage and compromised anti￾oxidant defenses in nerve terminals and striatum of young
rats [17]. In conclusion, the mitochondrial impairment in
MMAuria seems to be a combination of inhibition of spe￾cific enzymes and transporters, limitation in the availability
of substrates and oxidative damage [18].
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) has a limited transport
capacity for dicarboxylates [19]. It has been hypothesized
that in MMAuria brain-generated dicarboxylates might
be trapped in the CNS and cause neurodegeneration.
A low, but specific efflux transport via organic anion
transporter 1 (OAT1) and OAT3 has been shown for
MMA across porcine brain capillary endothelial cells, an
in vitro model of the BBB [20]. It was also assumed that
MMA might interfere with the transport of dicarboxy￾lates between neurons and astrocytes [21].
During the last years brain damage has become one of
the major research topics in MMAuria. The understanding
Jafari et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:4 Page 2 of 14
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/4

of the underlying neuropathological mechanisms is crucial
for the development of preventive treatments. In this study
we report on the differential effects that have been
observed when exposing developing brain cells in 3D orga￾notypic rat brain cell cultures to MMA, PA and 2-MCA,
the main metabolites of MMAuria.
Methods
Unfortunately, so far there is no viable knock-out mouse
model for isolated MMAuria. We decided to use the 3D
rat organotypic brain cell cultures in aggregates as this
in vitro system is well established and has been proven
to be a good model for the study of inborn errors of
metabolism in the CNS [22,23]. In addition to the 3-
dimensional structure containing all brain cell types, the
advantage of this model is the possibility to study dif￾ferent stages of brain cell development and maturation.
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance to the
Ethical Principles and Guidelines for Scientific Experi￾ments on Animals of the Swiss Academy for Medical
Sciences. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Com￾mittee for Animal Experimentation (Service de la consom￾mation et des affaires vétérinaires, Epalinges, Switzerland;
No. 1172.5). Sufficient amount of food and water for
transportation and period before sacrificing of the rats
was added by the commercial provider. All animals were
sacrificed 48 hours after commercial delivery by decapita￾tion with the use of a guillotine to avoid animal suffering.
3D rat organotypic brain cell cultures in aggregates
Pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan; Netherlands)
were sacrificed on day 15 of gestation. Fetal whole brains
were extracted, pooled and mechanically dissociated.
3.6x 107 cells were grown in 8 ml of a serum-free,
chemically-defined medium with 25 mM glucose and
maintained under constant gyratory agitation at 37°C, in
an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% humidified air to
form reaggregated 3D primary brain cell cultures as pre￾viously described [22,24]. Media were replenished every
three days from day-in-vitro (DIV) 5, by exchanging 5 ml
of medium per culture. On the day of harvest aggregate
pellets were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS) and either embedded for histology in
cryoform (Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound, Sakura Finetek,
Netherlands) and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled
2-methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); or directly
frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80°C until analysis.
Treatment protocols
Cultures were treated with 0.01, 0.1, 0.33 and 1 mM 2-
MCA (Ernesto Brunet-Romero, Madrid, Spain), 1 mM
MMA (Fluka, No 67750, Switzerland) or 1 mM sodium
propionate (PA, Sigma-Aldrich, N° P1880, Germany)
buffered in 25 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)
and with pH adjusted to 7.5. Cultures were exposed to
one of the three metabolites 6 times every 12 hours at
two different developmental stages starting from DIV 5
in protocol A or from DIV 11 in protocol B (Figure 1).
Aggregates were harvested 5 hours after the last treatment
at DIV 8 in protocol A and at DIV 14 in protocol B.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on 16
μm aggregate cryosections using antibodies against dif￾ferent markers of brain cell types: phosphorylated
medium weight neurofilament (p-NFM; clone NN18,
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for neurons [25], glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP; Millipore, USA) for astrocytes,
galactocerebroside (GalC; Millipore, USA) on DIV 8 and
myelin basic protein (MBP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA) on DIV 14 for oligodendrocytes, and peroxidase￾labeled isolectin B4 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) on DIV 8 for
microglia. Briefly, sections were fixed for 1 h in 4% parafor￾maldehyde in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at room
temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched
with 1.5% H2O2 in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and
non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked with 1%
bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA-PBS; Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany) for 1 h. Primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in 1%
BSA-PBS where applied to sections and further detected
with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish
peroxidase (HRP, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Staining was
processed using the AEC Substrate Set for BD™ ELISPOT
according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences,
USA). For negative controls, primary antibodies were

omitted resulting in no staining. The stained sections were
mounted under FluorSave™ Reagent (Calbiochem, USA),
observed and digitized using an Olympus BX50 microscope
equipped with a UC30 digital camera (Olympus, Japan).
Immunofluorescence
Detection of cleaved caspase-3 in aggregates was per￾formed with the Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit (Life
Technologies, USA). Aggregate cryosections (16 μm)
were subjected to the same procedure as described
above for immunohistochemistry. Non-specific antibody
binding sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature
with the blocking buffer of the kit. The primary antibody
against the large fragment (17/19kDa) of activated
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted
1:1000 in blocking buffer was applied to sections over￾night at 4°C. After washing, sections were incubated
with a HRP anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (provided
by the kit) for 1 h. Peroxidase staining was performed
using Alexa FluorW 555-labeled tyramide diluted 1:200 in
amplification buffer (provided by the kit) and applied to
sections for 10 min. Negative controls were processed the
same but omitting the primary antibody, resulting in no
staining. Sections were mounted under FluorSave™ re￾agent. The sections were observed and photographed with
an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a UC30
digital camera.
In situ cell death detection
To detect typical features of apoptosis (fragmented nuclei,
apoptotic bodies), nuclear DNA was stained using the blue
fluorescent 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitro￾gen, USA). Aggregate cryosections (16 μm) were incu￾bated with DAPI for 10 min at room temperature. In situ
detection of cell death was performed using terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) on 16 μm cryosections of aggre￾gates. TUNEL staining was performed according to sup￾plier recommendations using the In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit with Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science,
Switzerland) resulting in green fluorescence in dying cells.
Western blot analysis
Aggregates were homogenized in 150 mM sodium chlor￾ide, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany) and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail - Complete
Mini (Roche Applied Science, Switzerland) and sonicated
for 5 seconds. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
12’000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. After dilution, protein con￾tent was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)
(Thermo Scientific, USA) and diluted to a final concentra￾tion of 1.2 μg/μl in NuPAGEW LDS Sample Buffer (Life
Technologies, USA). Samples were heated at 70°C for 10
min and resolved on NuPAGEW 4-12% Bis–Tris Gel (for
p-NFM) or NuPAGEW 12% Bis–Tris Gel (for GFAP,
MBP, actin and caspase-3) using NuPAGEW MOPS SDS
Running Buffer (Life Technologies, USA) at a constant
voltage (200 V, 60 min). Proteins were transferred onto
Immobilon-FL PVDF, 0.45 μm membranes (Millipore,
USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk
in TBS-Tween (20 mM Trizma base, 137 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature. After
blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight with
different primary antibodies against GFAP, MBP, p-NFM,
Actin (I-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) or full-length
(35kDa) and large fragment (17/19 kDa) of caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling Technology, USA) diluted 1:1000 in 3% dry
milk and TBS-Tween. The membranes were probed with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit
IgG (1:3000; Vector laboratories, USA) and developed
by chemiluminescence (ECL Western Blotting Detection
Reagents; GE Healthcare, France). Blots were stripped
(ReBlot Plus Mild Antibody Stripping Solution; Millipore,
USA) and re-probed with antibody against actin as the
loading control. Images were taken with a Luminescent
Image Analyzer LAS-4000 (Fujifilm; Life Science) and
quantified with the public Java-based image processing pro￾gram ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Data acquired
in arbitrary densitometric units were normalized to actin
and transformed to percentages of the densitometric levels
obtained from scans of control samples visualized on the
same blots.
Measure of basic metabolites and amino acids in the
culture media
Ammonium was measured on an Integra automatic
analyzer (Roche); glucose, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) were measured on a Modular automatic analyzer
(Roche); free amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman
6300 amino acid analyzer; as described previously [26].
Statistics
All data points are expressed as mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM). Statistical difference was determined
with Student’s t-test.
Results and discussion
We used 3D organotypic brain cell cultures in aggregates
to explore, in vitro, the effects of the three main metabo￾lites (2-MCA, MMA and PA) accumulated in body fluids
of subjects affected by MMAuria. Our in vitro model is
particularly suitable for studying neurotoxicity because
the aggregates contain all types of brain cells with their
spontaneous connections between each other. In addition,
this model reproduces early phases of brain development
and has proven to be optimal to study differential effects
of metabolic derangements (such as hyperammonemia)
in developing brain compared to adult brain tissue

[22-25]. This is particularly important when studying a
disorder in which the most dramatic brain damage occurs
in early childhood.
Morphological changes of developing brain cells in our
in vitro model for MMAuria
Neurons
Immunohistochemical staining for p-NFM that normally
only labels axons showed a substantial decrease of axonal
labeling at DIV 8, and interestingly a retention of the
signal in neuronal bodies at DIV 8 and 14, after exposure
to 2-MCA and to a lesser extend to PA on DIV 8
(Figure 2A; left panel). For 2-MCA, signal retention was
already observed at 0.01 mM, the lowest tested concentra￾tion, on DIV 8 and at 0.1 mM on DIV 14 (Figure 2B). In
contrast, MMA exposure on DIV 8 induced a slight in￾crease of p-NFM expression, without altering neuronal
and axonal morphology (Figure 2A; left panel, DIV 8).
This signal increase may be explained by a stimulatory
effect of MMA on neuronal growth or differentiation, as

three replicates taken from two independent experiments.

also described below for oligodendrocytes. The semi￾quantitative analysis of p-NFM expression by western
blotting showed an increase in cultures treated with all
metabolites compared to control on DIV 8 (Figure 2A;
right panel). Higher p-NFM expression after 2-MCA and
PA exposure on DIV 8 is most likely an artifact which can
probably be explained by the deleterious effect on the over￾all cell survival leading to diminished total protein content
in these cultures. Since western blots are performed with a
defined protein quantity this might lead to the appearance
of a falsely increased expression of this protein.
Astrocytes
Compared to controls aggregates treated with 2-MCA
showed a significant decrease in astrocyte fiber density,
an enlargement of astrocytic bodies and a swelling of
proximal fibers (Figure 3A, left panel). On DIV 8 a de￾crease of fiber density was already observed after expo￾sure to 0.01 mM 2-MCA, followed by the appearance of
swollen fibers and astrocytic bodies at 0.1 mM. On DIV
14 enlarged astrocytic bodies were already observed at
0.01 mM, whereas a decreased fiber density and swollen
fibers were only present from concentrations of 0.1 mM

on (Figure 3B). We speculate that this is the early ap￾pearance of suffering astrocytes that are going to develop
a major swelling. Exposure to PA on DIV 14 revealed a
slight decrease in the density of astrocytic fibers
(Figure 3A; left panel). Aggregates treated with PA (DIV 8)
or with MMA (DIV 8 and 14) did not show any significant
changes compared to controls (Figure 3A; left panel). A
western blot quantification of GFAP expression was per￾formed and did not present any significant alteration for
any of the treatments (Figure 3A; right panel).
Oligodendrocytes
Oligodendrocytes in immature cultures (DIV 8) were
studied with GalC, which is one of the earliest markers
for this cell type. We did not observe any substantial
effect on GalC signal for the treatments on DIV 8
(Figure 4A; left panel; DIV 8). For more developed cul￾tures (DIV 14) MBP staining was used. Treatment with
2-MCA on DIV 14 revealed a signal loss for MBP,
whereas exposure to MMA and PA resulted in a signifi￾cant signal increase (Figure 4A; left panel; DIV 14). In
the dose–response experiment for 2-MCA a slight de￾crease of MBP signal was already observed at 0.1 mM
(Figure 4B). Western blotting of cultures from DIV 14
confirmed a slightly increased expression of MBP after
MMA treatment and the decreased MBP expression
after 2-MCA exposure (Figure 4A; right panel).
Microglia
The presence of microglia was tested by immunostaining
for isolectin on DIV 8. No interesting changes were
observed (data not shown).

In contrast to previous studies [14] we could not show
any deleterious effects of MMA on brain cell morph￾ology in our in vitro model for MMAuria. The only
observation that differed from controls was a slight
stimulation of neuronal and oligodendrocytic growth or
differentiation on DIV 8 and DIV 14, respectively. This
finding and its consequences for the developing brain
has to be further assessed. 2-MCA turned out to be the
most destructive metabolite in our model with effects on
cell morphology already visible at concentrations as low
as 0.01 mM. Light microscopy showed that astrocytes
at both developmental stages severely suffered from
2-MCA treatment showing fiber reduction and proximal
fiber swelling. Further, 2-MCA exposure of immature
cultures (DIV 8) resulted in diminished axonal outgrowth,
retarded neuronal differentiation or axonal degeneration,
also observed on DIV 8 and DIV 14 by p-NFM accumula￾tion in neuronal cell bodies. In more developed cultures
(DIV 14) 2-MCA exposure let to retarded differentiation
of oligodendrocytes. PA exposure had less pronounced
effects on neuronal differentiation on DIV 8 and subtle
oligodendrocytic boosting on DIV 14.
Biochemical changes in culture media in our in vitro
model for MMAuria
Glucose and Lactate
As compared to controls, PA exposure on DIV 8 and
2-MCA exposure on DIV 14 caused a significant decrease
in the glucose levels, while glucose levels of cultures
exposed to MMA did not change significantly (Figure 5A).
In parallel to decreased glucose levels, a significant increase
in lactate levels was measured in the medium of cultures
treated with 2-MCA and PA on DIV 8 and 14 (Figure 5B).
No significant changes of glucose or lactate levels were
observed for 2-MCA concentrations below 1 mM on DIV
8 (data not shown) and 14 (Figure 5A and B, right panel).
Ammonium and Glutamine
A significant increase in ammonium concentrations was
measured in culture media after exposure to 2-MCA
and PA on DIV 8 and 14 with a 25-fold ammonium
increase after 2-MCA treatment on DIV 14 (Figure 6A).
In parallel to the described increase of ammonium levels

a lesser extent with PA on DIV 8 was observed (Figure 6B).
Dose–response experiments with lower 2-MCA concentra￾tions revealed a significant change of ammonium and glu￾tamine starting at 0.1 mM (Figure 6C and D).
For human hyperammonemic patients, data are lack￾ing on extracellular brain ammonium concentration.
However, serum levels of ammonium leading to irrevers￾ible damage to the developing CNS can peak as high as
2000 μM, usually after chronic hyperammonemia in the
range of 200 μM [27]. The correlation of hyperammone￾mia and decreased glutamine levels has already been
observed in patients with propionic acidemia. The authors
discussed a potential inhibition of the enzyme glutamine
synthetase, but conclude due to a series of other metabolic
alterations observed in patients that hyperammonemia
can more likely be explained by the inability to maintain
adequate levels of glutamine precursors through a dys￾functional Krebs cycle [28]. The observed ammonia con￾centrations are comparable to those applied to the same
in vitro model to induce brain cell damage when modeling
urea cycle disorders [25].
The biochemical parameters confirm the observations
from brain cell morphology concerning the toxicity of
the three metabolites: MMA exposure does not signifi￾cantly alter the metabolism of brain cells. Surprisingly,
media of cultures treated with 2-MCA contained 25-fold
more ammonium than controls. Ammonium is a well
known toxin for the CNS. It has been shown to have an
influence on axonal elongation [25], to provoke astro￾cytic swelling and to contribute to white matter changes
observed in patients suffering from primary hyperammo￾nemia [29]. This could implicate that patients with
MMAuria during crisis might suffer from a more severe
intracerebral ammonium accumulation than predicted
by blood hyperammonemia and may also suffer from
cerebral ammonia intoxication during chronic illness,
leading to brain damage even in the absence of meta￾bolic acidosis and hyperammonemia. If confirmed by
further investigations in vivo, this finding might open
new therapeutic perspectives. The cause of ammonium
accumulation in brain cells is unclear. Urea cycle enzymes
are incompletely expressed in brain; amino acid catabo￾lism in brain cells produces ammonium at a slower
rate than in liver and therefore glutamine synthesis is suf￾ficient to avoid ammonia accumulation. The astrocytic
ATP-dependent enzyme glutamine synthetase acts under
physiological conditions as a buffering system for detoxifi￾cation of ammonium in the CNS. In conditions of elevated
ammonium, glutamine is expected to increase accordingly.
Surprisingly, media of 2-MCA-treated cultures revealed,
besides elevated ammonium, significantly decreased glu￾tamine levels. This suggests that ammonium accumula￾tion is the consequence of either 2-MCA related
inhibition of glutamine synthetase activity, astrocytic
death leading to lack of glutamine synthetase, or energy
failure with lack of ATP resulting in inhibition of glutam￾ine synthetase activity.
2-MCA treatment further resulted in a decrease of
glucose levels and an increase of lactate in culture
media. Low concentration studies for 2-MCA exposure
revealed that this effect cannot be observed after expos￾ure to less than 1 mM suggesting that this is a secondary
effect in the neuropathogenesis. The combination of
decreased glucose levels and increased lactate produc￾tion is also observed in patients’ blood during metabolic
crisis. Underlying mechanisms may be the uncoupling
of the respiratory chain as suggested by previous pub￾lications [18] and/or the inhibition of gluconeogenesis.
In Salmonella enterica, 2-MCA was found to inhibit
fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, the key enzyme for gluco￾neogenesis, and to interfere with cell growth. This effect
was overcome by increase of glucose concentration in
the culture medium [30]. Culture exposure to PA reveals
similar, but less impressive effects on biochemical para￾meters in culture media in comparison to 2-MCA treat￾ment. As biochemical changes are only observed with
higher 2-MCA concentrations than the morphological
changes they might not be the origin but the consequence
of 2-MCA toxicity on the different brain cell types.
2-MCA induced apoptosis in developing brain cells
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in culture
medium and was substantially increased after 2-MCA
exposure on DIV 8 and after 2-MCA or MMA exposure
on DIV 14 (Figure 7B). This observation indicated a pos￾sible increase of cell death in these cultures. To evaluate
cell death, we performed TUNEL, DAPI and activated
caspase-3 immunofluorescence labeling. DAPI staining
showed an increased appearance of nuclear fragmenta￾tion and apoptotic bodies in cultures treated with 2-MCA
and PA in both protocols (data not shown). Staining
for TUNEL showed an important signal increase in
cultures treated with 2-MCA on DIV 8 and 14 (data
not shown). These findings were confirmed by the obser￾vation of a massively increased number of apoptotic cells
in 2-MCA-treated cultures and a less pronounced increase
of apoptotic cells in PA-treated cultures derived from both
protocols (DIV 8 and 14) after staining for activated
caspase-3 (Figure 7A; left panel). Increased activation of
caspase-3 after treatment with 2-MCA on DIV 8 and DIV
14 or PA on DIV 8 was also confirmed by western blots
(Figure 7A; right panel). Interestingly, a substantial decrease
in the apoptosis rate was observed in MMA-exposed cells
in both protocols (Figure 7A; left panel). Dose–response
experiments with lower 2-MCA concentrations showed
an increase of cleaved caspase-3 signal starting from 0.1
mM on DIV 8 and from 0.33 mM on DIV 14 (Figure 8,
left panel). Western blots for cleaved caspase-3 revealed a

substantially increased activation starting at 0.33 mM on
DIV 8 and at 1 mM on DIV 14 (Figure 8, right panel). On
DIV 14, we observed an increased apoptosis rate only at
higher concentrations of 2-MCA (0.33 and 1 mM) com￾pared to DIV 8, where we see the effect already at 0.1 mM
2-MCA. This is probably due to an advanced maturation
of the cells in our aggregates.
Consistent with our findings on cell morphology and
metabolism, 2-MCA appears to be the most toxic me￾tabolite in our in vitro model leading to massive

apoptosis. Unfortunately, there is no data in the litera￾ture about intracerebral concentrations of 2-MCA in
MMAuria patients. Given the range of 2-MCA concentra￾tions found in plasma, urine or CSF of patients, the
observed effect of altered cell morphology starting already
at 0.01 mM, and of increased apoptosis starting at 0.1 mM
might however reflect the in vivo situation.
PA also has some destructive effects on cell survival that
are less striking than those of 2-MCA. The significant
decrease of apoptosis rate after MMA exposure remains
unexplained and needs to be further investigated.
The dying cells are most likely glial cells that could be
more sensitive to 2-MCA as they do not express the
enzymes of the catabolic propionate pathway [12]. Cell
death is also a known toxic effect of ammonium in the
CNS if exposed to high concentrations (5 mM) or pro￾longed in time [31]. There is striking parallelism be￾tween increase of ammonium, decrease of glutamine
and increase of apoptosis starting at 0.1 mM 2-MCA
on DIV 8 and at 0.33 mM on DIV 14 which supports
the hypothesis that there is a direct link between the
observed effects.
In our study we showed that 2-MCA is the most toxic
metabolite for brain cells under development. This is of
particular interest as 2-MCA is also a key metabolite
in another organic aciduria, namely propionic aciduria,
where it reaches comparable or even higher levels in
body fluids of patients. Patients suffering from propionic
aciduria show neurological symptoms similar to those
observed in MMAuria [32]. It is thus likely, that the
same mechanisms contribute to neuropathophysiology
in both diseases.
Conclusions
In our model of 3D rat organotypic brain cell cultures in
aggregates, low concentrations of 2-MCA already have

deleterious effects on neurons (limited axonal growth)
and glial cells (cell swelling and massive apoptosis).
These effects seem to precede a striking ammonium ac￾cumulation and increased apoptosis. These observations
indicate that ammonium may be a key player in the neu￾ropathogenesis of MMAuria and therefore might be a
potential target for neuroprotective measures. Ammo￾nium accumulation might be responsible for brain dam￾age in MMAuria patients not only during metabolic
crises but also on chronic disease course and even after
liver transplantation.
