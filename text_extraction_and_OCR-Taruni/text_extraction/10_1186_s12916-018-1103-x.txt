Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide.
It affects an estimated 20% of the general population, based on cohort studies of varying size and heterogeneous
selection. However, the prevalence and incidence of recorded NAFLD diagnoses in unselected real-world health￾care records is unknown. We harmonised health records from four major European territories and assessed age￾and sex-specific point prevalence and incidence of NAFLD over the past decade.
Methods: Data were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (UK), Health Search Database (Italy), Information
System for Research in Primary Care (Spain) and Integrated Primary Care Information (Netherlands). Each database uses a
different coding system. Prevalence and incidence estimates were pooled across databases by random-effects meta￾analysis after a log-transformation.
Results: Data were available for 17,669,973 adults, of which 176,114 had a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD. Pooled
prevalence trebled from 0.60% in 2007 (95% confidence interval: 0.41–0.79) to 1.85% (0.91–2.79) in 2014. Incidence
doubled from 1.32 (0.83–1.82) to 2.35 (1.29–3.40) per 1000 person-years. The FIB-4 non-invasive estimate of liver fibrosis
could be calculated in 40.6% of patients, of whom 29.6–35.7% had indeterminate or high-risk scores.
Conclusions: In the largest primary-care record study of its kind to date, rates of recorded NAFLD are much lower than
expected suggesting under-diagnosis and under-recording. Despite this, we have identified rising incidence and
prevalence of the diagnosis. Improved recognition of NAFLD may identify people who will benefit from risk factor
modification or emerging therapies to prevent progression to cardiometabolic and hepatic complications.

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly be￾coming the most common cause of chronic liver disease
worldwide [1]. NAFLD is a spectrum of diseases that en￾compasses uncomplicated steatosis, non-alcoholic steato￾hepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, which in a small
proportion can lead to complications including cirrhosis,
liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [2]. NAFLD is a
multisystem disease with a multidirectional relationship
with the metabolic syndrome [3–5]. NAFLD is associated
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease [5–7] and
cancer [8]. Among other high-risk groups [9], people with
diabetes and NAFLD are at increased risk of micro- and
macrovascular complications [10, 11] and these patients
have a twofold increased risk of all-cause mortality [12].
The estimated point prevalence of NAFLD in the gen￾eral Western population is 20–30%, largely based on co￾hort studies with heterogeneous inclusion criteria and
research methods [13]. The prevalence of NAFLD rises
to 40–70% among patients with type 2 diabetes and up
to 90% among patients with morbid obesity [14–16].
Moreover, as the rates of diabetes and obesity rise world￾wide, it is expected that NAFLD will become even more

common. NAFLD-related cirrhosis is currently the third
most common indication and is anticipated to become
the leading indication for liver transplantation in the
USA within the next one to two decades [17].
There is much debate about whether screening pro￾grammes in the general population or in at-risk groups,
such as people with diabetes [9], should be implemented
[18, 19]. This debate is based on our current under￾standing of the epidemiology and natural history of
NAFLD, which, in turn, derives from cohort or
cross-sectional studies [13]. These are often highly se￾lected studies of individuals with metabolic risk factors,
or they involve extensive phenotyping that would be un￾realistic in routine practice.
A pragmatic approach is to focus on real-world patients
for whom the diagnosis of NAFLD has been made during
routine clinical care. A diagnosis of NAFLD is often made
following abnormal imaging of the liver or elevated serum
liver enzymes (so-called liver function tests) and involves
exclusion of other causes of liver injury, such as excess al￾cohol consumption and viral hepatitis. Although routinely
collected data can represent only the visible part of the
clinical iceberg, there is a growing body of literature that
has used well-curated electronic health records (EHRs) to
study disease characteristics and epidemiology in large
numbers of people [20–22].
In many European countries where health care is
largely state funded and there are low or absent
primary-care co-payments, the population has unre￾stricted access to health care with primary-care physi￾cians acting as gatekeepers (including referral to
secondary care) [23]. Healthy people register with
primary-care centres when they move to an area to ac￾cess health care when it is be needed and so
primary-care EHR represent data that are as close to a
general population as possible, with near universal
coverage of the population in the region where the data
is collected. Recording of a diagnosis in European
primary-care databases is not driven by reimbursement
and the patient population is relatively stable compared
to other types of EHRs, such as US claims databases.
Primary-care databases hold comprehensive medical re￾cords, which include diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory
values, lifestyle and health measures, and demographic
information for a large and representative sample of pa￾tients. Concerns around the degree of data completeness
are now largely historic as the vast majority of practices
are paper-free and therefore, these data represent the
only clinical record for care, administration and
re-imbursement. Thus, within the areas that utilise these
databases, coverage is near universal. If a practice joins
the database, all the patients of that practice are regis￾tered in the database. Although there is an option for in￾dividual patients to opt out, this is minimal (<1%).
In this study, we harmonised health-care records for
17.7 million adults from four large European
primary-health-care databases to estimate the prevalence
and incidence of recorded diagnoses of NAFLD and,
where available, NASH, in patients in primary care and
to compare these with estimates from cohort studies.
We sought to ascertain the changes in prevalence and
incidence of recorded diagnoses of NAFLD from 2007 to
2015, and the effect of age and sex. We compared the
characteristics of patients with an NAFLD diagnosis in
the different databases and reported, where possible, the
proportion of patients with markers of advanced disease
in the diagnosed population.
Methods
Databases
Ethical approval was obtained by data custodians of each
primary-care database according to local institutional re￾view board requirements. Anonymised data were ex￾tracted from the Health Search Database (HSD) in Italy
[24], the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) in
the Netherlands [25], The Health Improvement Network
(THIN) in the UK [26] and the Information System for
Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) in the Catalonia re￾gion of Spain [27] (Additional file 1: Table S1).
THIN, HSD and IPCI had all reached high levels of pa￾tient registration from January 2004 onwards. SIDIAP
started data collection in 2005 and has high quality data
from 2006. Data entered between 1 January 2004 (SIDIAP
from 1 January 2007) and up to 31 December 2015 were
included in incidence estimates. Individuals were excluded
if they had less than 1 year of follow-up post registration
into the database. Individuals with a diagnosis of NAFLD
were not included in the analyses if they also had a re￾corded history of alcohol abuse. To maximise data com￾pleteness, we included only patients whose NAFLD
diagnosis occurred within ±6 months of a general practi￾tioner (GP) visit when describing patients’ characteristics
(Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S3).
Patient involvement
All eligible patients were included in the study. Routine
health-care records were collected from patients at each
encounter with a health-care practitioner. Following
local regulations, patients who did not wish to share
their data were able to withdraw from the databases.
Semantic harmonisation and case ascertainment
The four databases each use different coding systems
(Additional file 1: Table S1). As a result, the capture of
NAFLD and NASH diagnoses differed across databases.
In HSD and IPCI, NAFLD and NASH were captured in
a single code as ‘NAFLD or NASH’. In SIDIAP and
THIN, NAFLD and NASH were coded separately,
Alexander et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:130 Page 2 of 11

branching out of a ‘NAFLD or NASH’ code. In this
study, we extracted all ‘NAFLD or NASH’ diagnoses as
well as ‘NASH only diagnoses’ where available. For
simplicity, we labelled ‘NAFLD or NASH’ as ‘NAFLD’
and ‘NASH only’ as ‘NASH’. Code lists were generated
for the four terminologies (ICD9CM, Read Codes,
SNOMEDCTUS and ICD10) that mapped to the same
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts [28]
(Additional file 1: Table S2).
Clinical diagnoses were defined with these code lists
using the same process of harmonisation (code lists
available on request). In SIDIAP, we used a combination
of clinical codes and answers to questionnaires on alco￾hol consumption to identify alcohol abuse.
Given the absence of a code for NAFLD in the IPCI
terminology, we additionally used text-mining in this
database. The algorithm to identify NAFLD in IPCI is
detailed in Additional file 1: Figure S1. Patients with re￾cords for the following search terms were extracted:
‘NASH’, ‘NAFLD’, ‘steatohepatitis’ or ‘fatty liver disease’ as
distinct words preceded by a space and followed by a
space, or at the beginning or end of a sentence. Patients
with relevant search terms preceded by a negation term
(e.g. ‘no’ or ‘not’) were excluded. To validate the
text-mining, 100 individuals identified using free-text
were randomly sampled. Their complete medical charts
were manually reviewed to confirm that the clinical data
support the text-mining-derived diagnosis.
Use of historical data
Governance rules differed between the different databases.
In HSD and SIDIAP, there were no records available prior
to a primary-care practice joining the database. In THIN,
data from patients who had already left the practice were
available, so NAFLD/NASH diagnoses made prior to the
patient’s primary-care practice joining THIN were
counted in both incidence and prevalence estimates. How￾ever, in IPCI, records that predated their primary-care
practice joining the database were available only for pa￾tients who remained in the practice (since leavers did not
have the opportunity to refuse to participate). Therefore,
historic diagnoses could be included in the point preva￾lence. However, given that both the number of new diag￾noses made as well as the total number of patients at risk
in a given period were unknown, we could not include
diagnoses made before the patient joined a practice in in￾cidence estimates in IPCI.
Other data extraction
Demographic information, lifestyle and medical history of
relevant morbidities were also extracted for all NAFLD
and NASH patients identified in the four databases.
Medical records for type 2 diabetes and hypertension at
any time prior to NAFLD or NASH diagnosis were ex￾tracted. Code lists for those diagnoses were harmonised
across the databases using the semantic harmonisation de￾scribed in ‘Methods’, which aligns all terms for the same
list of UMLS concepts (code lists available on request).
Laboratory values for aspartate transaminase (AST), ala￾nine transaminase (ALT) and platelet count were extracted.
We used the values closest to the time of NAFLD diagnosis
(up to 2 years prior to diagnosis or less than 6 months
after). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for all
NAFLD patients with weight recorded between 2 years
prior to and 6 months after diagnosis, and with height re￾corded anytime in adulthood. We excluded values that
were likely to be implausible: BMI below 15 kg/m2
, labora￾tory values greater than the mean in the database plus 3
times the standard deviation, AST and ALT less than
5 IU/L, and platelet counts below 5 × 109 L–1
.
The FIB-4 index was calculated to provide an estimate
of the severity of fibrosis in patients at the time of their
NAFLD diagnosis. The formula for FIB-4 is: Age [years]
× AST [U/L] / (platelet [109
] × √ALT [U/L]) [29]. The
cut-offs for FIB-4 scoring for NAFLD are <1.30 for a low
risk of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, between 1.30 and
2.67 for an indeterminate score and 2.67 for a high risk
of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [30].

distribution, and qualitative variables as percentages.
Differences in patients’ characteristics between the four
databases were tested by an ANOVA test for quantitative
characteristics and a chi-square test for categorical
characteristics.
Incidence in the adult population aged ≥18 years old
was estimated by dividing the number of individuals
with a diagnosis of NAFLD (or NASH where relevant)
by the total number of person-years at risk. Incidence
was reported by predefined age categories, gender and
calendar year.
Point prevalence was estimated for 1 January of each
calendar year available in the data, by gender and by pre￾defined age categories. Point prevalence was defined as
the total number of individuals with a recorded NAFLD
diagnosis at or prior to 1 January of a calendar year and
who were still active in the database, divided by the total
number of active patients in the database on that date.
In addition, the 1-year period prevalence was estimated
in a sensitivity analysis to account for potential differences
in length of follow-up across databases, and over time
within databases. The 1-year period prevalence was de￾fined for each calendar year available as the number of
new individuals with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD in a
calendar year divided by the average number of active pa￾tients in that year (defined as the number on 1 January
plus the number on 31 December divided by 2).
Age was computed at the end of the year for period
prevalence (31 December of the year of interest). For point
prevalnce, age was computed on 1 January of the year of
interest. Within each database, incidence estimates were
compared by calendar year (assuming a linear relation￾ship), sex (males are the reference group) and age group
(age 60–69 is the reference group) by fitting Poisson dis￾tributions. Prevalence estimates were compared by fitting
logistic regressions and performing chi-square tests. P <
0.001 was considered as significant, although note that
with such large datasets, a high level of significance can
be achieved even for minimal absolute differences in
prevalence and incidence levels.
Incidence and prevalence estimates were pooled for
each calendar year across the four databases using a ran￾dom effects meta-analysis after natural log-transformation
(weighting by the inverse of the variance). We reported
the I
2 statistic, which gives the percentage of variation
among databases attributable to heterogeneity, and the
p values of heterogeneity (p-het), tested using Q statis￾tics. To investigate sources of heterogeneity, we tested for
a linear association between incidence and point preva￾lence with calendar year by fitting a meta-regression.
Data were extracted and analysed using the European
Medical Information Framework (EMIF) with a distrib￾uted network approach that allows data custodians to
maintain control over their protected data [31]. Each
data custodian extracted data from their database into
four common files: prescriptions, measurements, events
and patients. These files were transformed locally by
the data transformation tool Jerboa Reloaded, which
produces analytical datasets that can be shared with
data analysts in a central remote research environment
for further post-processing. The analytical datasets
contained characteristics for each patient with a
NAFLD diagnosis, as well as aggregated results on inci￾dence and prevalence by age, gender and calendar year.
Quality controls were run on each database and the re￾search team communicated with data custodians to
confirm results. Statistics and graphics were generated
in the remote research environment using the statistical
software Stata/SE 14.1.
Results
Semantic harmonisation to identify the European NAFLD
cohort
In total, the four European databases held data on
21,981,019 patients, of whom 17,699,973 adults had been
registered for at least 1 year in adulthood (Table 1).
Using semantic harmonisation, we identified 176,114 pa￾tients who had a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD (includ￾ing NASH). This represents 1.0% of the total population,
ranging from 0.3% in the UK (THIN) to 2.7% in the
Netherlands (IPCI). The largest number of NAFLD pa￾tients was in the Spanish cohort (SIDIAP, n = 77,547,
Table 1). Recording of NASH diagnoses was possible
only in Spain (SIDIAP, n = 1887) and in the UK (THIN,
n = 1133), as the other two databases did not have spe￾cific codes distinguishing NAFLD from NASH. Given
the small numbers overall, we did not pursue an analysis
of NASH incidence and prevalence further and we in￾cluded these patients within the total number of patients
with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD.
In the Dutch database (IPCI), the majority of patients
were identified via free-text mining with seed words
‘NAFLD’, ‘NASH’, ‘fatty liver’ or ‘steatosis’, and a minority
from diagnostic codes only (see Additional file 1: Figure
S1). The code for ‘liver steatosis’ (D97.05) identified
1282 patients. The code for ‘cirrhosis/other liver disease’
(D97.00) identified 4228 patients when combined with a
free-text search on the code label and 1214 additional
patients when combined with a free-text search any￾where in the medical records. Searching for the search
terms in free text in the absence of a relevant code iden￾tified 44,442 additional patients. Of these, 19,048 pa￾tients had an incident NAFLD diagnosis (recorded at a
time when the patient’s general practice was contribut￾ing to IPCI). In the sample of 100 cases that were
manually reviewed, the positive predictive value for a
text-mined diagnosis of NAFLD was 98%.
Alexander et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:130 Page 4 of 11

We identified only a small proportion of patients with
a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD who also drank alcohol
in excess of recommended limits: 3130 (7.0%) NAFLD
patients in IPCI, 921 in HSD (3.3%), 12,461 in SIDIAP
(14.1%) and 925 in THIN (3.8%). These patients were
excluded from the statistical analysis.
The characteristics of the populations of patients with
an incident diagnosis of NAFLD made during the study
period, after exclusions, are shown in Table 2 for the in￾dividual databases. There were minor differences in the
mean age, proportion of patients with impaired fasting
glucose or diabetes, and platelet count in each of the
four databases. However, we observed that HSD had sta￾tistically significantly higher proportions of males and
patients with hypertension than other databases. There
was considerable variation in recorded BMI (29.7 kg/m2
in HSD to 32.4 kg/m2 in THIN), alanine transaminase
(ALT) levels (median 28 IU/L in HSD to 39 IU/L in
THIN) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels (median
24 IU/L in HSD to 32 IU/L in THIN). Moreover, we ob￾served variation in clinical practice with higher rates of
BMI being recorded and ALT requests in THIN and
SIDIAP compared to IPCI and HSD (Table 2 and
Additional file 1: Table S3).
Non-invasive scores that estimate the degree of liver
fibrosis can be calculated from clinical parameters and
are used to risk-stratify patients with NAFLD. Although
both ALT and AST are required to calculate the majority
of such non-invasive scores, ALT was more frequently
available than AST in all four databases (Additional file 1:
Table S3). An AST result was available for 21% (THIN) to
68% (HSD) and an ALT result for 67% (IPCI) to 86%
(SIDIAP). This is reflected in the proportion of patients
in whom a FIB-4 non-invasive assessment of liver fibro￾sis could be calculated, ranging from 11% in THIN to
54% in SIDIAP. Despite having the smallest number
(and percentage) of patients in whom we could calcu￾late FIB-4, the THIN database had the highest
proportion of patients with high-risk scores indicative
of advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis (10.0% vs 2.9–
4.3%, p < 0.001). In practice, patients with indetermin￾ate or high-risk scores are often managed with further
assessment leading to a liver biopsy. The proportion of
patients with intermediate/high-risk scores was lower
in IPCI (29.8%) compared to the other databases
(35.0–35.7%); albeit the number of people for whom
we could calculate FIB-4 was variable.
The rising prevalence of NAFLD diagnosis
The overall (pooled) prevalence of NAFLD diagnosis
was low at 1.85% (95% CI: 0.91–2.79) (I
2 = 99.99%,
p-het < 0.001) on 1 January 2015, but it had trebled from
0.60% (0.41–0.79) (I
2 = 99.97%, p-het < 0.001) on 1
January 2007 (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Table S4).
The prevalence of recorded NAFLD diagnosis rose
over time in all databases, albeit levels and rates of rise

differed between databases, being highest in the
Netherlands (IPCI) and lowest in the UK (THIN). To con￾firm that those trends were not due to more complete med￾ical records being available in more recent years, we also
estimated 1-year period prevalence and observed rising
trends for the four databases (Additional file 1: Table S5).
There were no significant differences in prevalence be￾tween sexes in any database, but prevalence did vary by
age. Peak prevalence was in patients aged 60–79 in whom
it was >20 times higher than in 18–29 years old in IPCI
(4.89% versus 0.24%) and 10–14 times higher in the other
databases (Fig. 2 and Additional file 1: Table S6).
Incidence of NAFLD has doubled since 2007
The overall (pooled) incidence of recorded NAFLD diag￾noses was 2.35 (1.29–3.40; I
2 = 99.92%, p-het < 0.001)
per 1000 person-years in 2015, having approximately
doubled since 2007 (1.32; 0.83–1.82)) (see Fig. 3 and
Additional file 1: Table S7).
We observed heterogeneity between databases. In IPCI
and SIDIAP, there was a clear and consistent rise in inci￾dence with a 2.7-fold increase from 2004 to 2015 to 4.09
per 1000 person-years in IPCI and 3.2-fold increase from
2007 to 2015 to 2.61 per 1000 person-years in SIDIAP.
In HSD, there was no statistically significant change in
incidence between 2005 and 2015 (Additional file 1:
Table S6). Although the rate of rise in THIN was com￾parable to IPCI and SIDIAP, the very low starting rate
meant that despite a fivefold increase, the absolute in￾crease was still modest and the incidence in 2014 was
1.08 per 1000 person-years.
There was a significant difference between sexes in
HSD and SIDIAP (p < 0.05) but not in IPCI and THIN.
In HSD, IPCI and SIDIAP, peak incidence was in
60–69 year olds, and in 50–59 year olds in THIN
(but the estimate was not significantly different from that
in 60–69 year olds) and then decreased in older age
groups (Fig. 4, Additional file 1: Table S8).
Discussion
In the largest real-world study of its kind to date, we re￾port the incidence and prevalence of recorded NAFLD
diagnoses among 17.7 million adults in four different
European countries.
The databases used have been validated, are broadly
representative of the population of the country and have
been extensively used for pharmaco-epidemiology re￾search [17, 20] (Additional file 1: Table S1). Despite a
rise in incidence, our study found a large shortfall in
Europe between the expected number of patients with
NAFLD and NASH and the number with recorded diag￾noses. Although others have suggested that this might
be the case at a local level or in small questionnaire￾based exercises [32], this study has identified the scale of
that diagnostic gap across four European territories.
Under-recording of NAFLD in primary care may reflect
(i) missed opportunities to make the diagnosis by inves￾tigating abnormal liver enzyme values or imaging find￾ings, (ii) a lack of confidence to make the diagnosis even
if liver enzymes are in the reference range or (iii)
under-recognition of the diagnosis in secondary care.
Furthermore, many patients who do have the diagnosis

have not had the investigations required for appropriate
risk-stratification and therefore, specialist care may not
be offered to those at greatest need. The current study
represents a departure from existing population-level
study designs of NAFLD. Notwithstanding the limita￾tions discussed below, by using real-world data, we have
gained insight into current practice and attitudes to
NAFLD and into the changing face of NAFLD in
primary care.
We used UMLS semantic harmonisation to extract
primary-care EHR data and identify 176,114 patients
with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD. Despite variations
in coding systems, in the characteristics of the popula￾tions and in the health-care systems in each country, the
results from all four territories are broadly consistent.
They show rising incidence and prevalence of NAFLD;
however, the levels of recorded NAFLD in EHR
primary-care databases is many-fold lower than those
anticipated based on prior observation studies, which es￾timated the prevalence of NAFLD in the general Euro￾pean population to be 20–30% [33]. The characteristics
of patients in that study were comparable with those
with NAFLD in a recent systematic review of the litera￾ture and meta-analysis that included 101 studies [13].
That study reported the European prevalence of NAFLD
diagnosed by imaging to be 24% (95% CI: 16–34%) and
diagnosed by blood tests to be 13% (95% CI: 4–33%).
Thus, our pooled prevalence in European EHR databases
of 1.9% is at best ~1/6 and more likely only ~1/12 of the
estimates based on cohort data. Our estimates of inci￾dence in 2015 ranged from 1.1 to 4.1 per 1000 and are
approximately 10 times lower than expected based on co￾hort studies: 28 (95% CI: 19–41) per 1000 person-years in
Israel and 52 (95% CI: 28–97) per 1000 in Asia [13].
The prevalence of NAFLD diagnosis has trebled and
incidence has doubled over the period of this study. The
rising rates of co-morbid conditions such as diabetes
and obesity may be responsible for this. Other probable
factors include increased awareness among primary-care
and non-liver physicians, improved communication of
the diagnosis from secondary to primary care, and the
increased use of blood tests and imaging to investigate

common complaints such as abdominal pain or moni￾toring long-term conditions. Our data do not allow us to
test these hypotheses further; however, studies from
other groups also suggest that the total number of
people developing NAFLD is rising, as is the number of
people with NAFLD who develop life-threatening com￾plications [13].
Despite the consistency in overall findings, the differ￾ences between the databases are indicative of differing
practices. SIDIAP had a relatively large proportion of pa￾tients with a history of alcohol abuse (14.1%), although
all databases included at least some NAFLD patients
with recorded alcohol abuse. This reflects uncertainty in
the community as to whether an individual can have
fatty liver disease associated with metabolic syndrome
even if they drink alcohol in excess of recommended
limits, or indeed have any other cause of chronic liver
injury such as viral hepatitis. While clinical trials make
very precise distinctions between alcoholic and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the reality is that an
obese, diabetic and hypertensive patient can consume al￾cohol in excess of recommended limits and have liver
injury. There is no way to distinguish which aetiology is
the dominant cause, and so clinicians are quite comfort￾able with co-existing diagnoses. Indeed, some authors
now refer to BAFLD – both alcoholic and fatty liver dis￾ease. An alternative explanation may be that specialists
making the diagnosis of fatty liver are unaware of the
high alcohol use, either because of under-reporting by
patients or poor communication from GP practices.
In HSD, prevalence increased over time whereas inci￾dence has decreased in recent years. This can be explained
by a relatively stable population in which nearly all
patients were enrolled in 2000, see Additional file 1:
Figure S3, and remained in the database until
December 2015.
Text-mining in IPCI increased the number of NAFLD
diagnoses by over eightfold. This suggests that while the
diagnosis of NAFLD is being made, GPs are not record￾ing it, despite there being a code for liver steatosis in
IPCI. IPCI had the lowest level of ALT recording. A re￾cent survey of Dutch GPs explored attitudes to the im￾portance of NAFLD [34]. Only 47% of doctors used liver
tests in patients with NAFLD and non-invasive scores
were never used by 73% of respondents (we were able to
calculate FIB-4 scores in only 27% in IPCI).
The UK THIN database appears to outlie from the
others in several ways. The prevalence of recorded
NAFLD in THIN (0.2%) is much lower than the other
databases and markedly lower than that found in a study
of almost 700,000 adults in a primary-care EHR study in
London, UK (0.9%) [35]. Higher rates of alcohol record￾ing in the UK alone are unlikely to account for all this
difference. The median ALT was highest in THIN. This
may suggest that the diagnosis of NAFLD is more likely
to be made in the UK by investigating abnormal liver en￾zymes than in other territories. However, the data re￾quired to calculate FIB-4 were available in only 11% of
patients in THIN (Additional file 1: Table S3). NAFLD
patients in THIN had the highest mean BMI. Moreover,
THIN had the highest proportion of NAFLD patients
with diabetes or impaired fasting glucose and the highest
proportion of NAFLD patients with high-risk FIB-4
scores. Large-scale liver-biopsy-based cross-sectional
studies or replication of the current study in cohorts
with systematic ascertainment of the component of
FIB-4 would be needed to confirm that patients are diag￾nosed with NAFLD at more advanced stages in the UK
compared to other European countries.
Limitations of the study
When interpreting the data, it is important to consider
the following issues. In IPCI, a diagnostic code for
NAFLD was not available, therefore we devised an algo￾rithm based on the diagnostic code ‘liver steatosis’ and
excluding excess alcohol consumption. We did not do
this for all databases because the IPCI terminology con￾tains only 1073 clinical terms and therefore, general
practitioners often utilise the free text to record infor￾mation with greater precision, whereas the other coding
systems contain many more such concepts: ICD9CM
contains 40,855 terms, ICD10 contains 13,505 terms and
Read Codes contains 347,568 terms [36].
The number of cases of recorded NASH is too small
to make meaningful estimates of incidence and preva￾lence: 2–4% of patients with NAFLD in THIN and
SIDIAP in which NASH was coded. This is far short of
the 12.2% estimated from a US biopsy-based study [37].
This shortfall between coded NASH and the true burden
of disease is probably due to the same factors that result
in under-recording of NAFLD diagnosis: recognition, re￾ferral and coding in primary care, and under-diagnosis
or poor communication in secondary care.
It is not possible to verify the accuracy or origin of re￾corded diagnoses, although the characteristics of the pa￾tients derived from the four databases are in keeping
with the population one would expect with a NAFLD
diagnosis. Some individuals not in this study may have
undiagnosed NAFLD. Therefore, our results do not rep￾resent the true disease burden in the epidemiological
sense, rather they tell us what is actually happening with
people who currently have a diagnosis of NAFLD and
they can inform the arguments for or against greater ac￾tion in this area. While we cannot exclude the possibility
(however unlikely) that all the other millions of expected
NAFLD patients exist in other databases, we do not
make any conclusions about people outside this dataset.
Although primary-care data contain a large body of
Alexander et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:130 Page 9 of 11

information, this does not diminish the value of
well-phenotyped cohort studies in which NAFLD can be
ascertained systematically using standardised screening
methods (e.g. measuring liver enzymes or performing
ultrasound in all patients). That said, the databases in￾cluded in this study have been extensively used for re￾search and have been validated for diagnoses other than
NAFLD [24, 27, 38].
Conclusions
Clinical practice is evolving in this emerging field and as
yet there are no recommendations to screen formally for
NAFLD, even in high risk groups [39, 40]. One school of
thought is that if the only available intervention for
NAFLD or NASH is lifestyle change, then doctors are
already giving such advice to their patients, although the
extent to which patients take up such advice varies.
However, hepatic steatosis is an independent predictor
of diabetes [41, 42] and could, therefore, identify patients
who stand to benefit from lifestyle changes to prevent
diabetes and hepatic complications. Furthermore, the
emerging data suggesting hepatic steatosis is an inde￾pendent cardiovascular risk factor may be an additional
incentive for physicians to increase their awareness of
the early stages of NAFLD. At the more severe end of
the scale, novel therapies targeted at NASH and fibrosis
are already in phase III clinical trials and are expected to
be available in the next few years. These may change the
treatment paradigm. Therefore, the scale of the
health-care challenge posed by NAFLD and its sequelae
cannot simply be side-stepped by dismissing NAFLD as
pre-disease. Further research is required to quantify the
associations of NAFLD with outcomes and to determine
whether Wilson’s criteria for effective screening can be
fulfilled [43], thereby informing the screening debate.
