The novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the
world causing acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19)
that can result in severe disease and lethality. For SARS-CoV-2 to
enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at
two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore rep￾resent potential drug targets. In the present study, we show that S
can be cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2
site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the
S29 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation
of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells through
antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Fur￾thermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by
the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 in human airway cells. In
contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not
affect virus replication. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors
with furin inhibitor MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral ac￾tivity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single
serine protease inhibitor. Therefore, this approach has consid￾erable therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged and has rapidly
spread around the world causing a pandemic never before observed
with these viruses. The virus was identified as a new member of the
lineage b of the genus Betacoronavirus, which also contains the 2002
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and was named SARS￾CoV-2 by the World Health Organization. The respiratory disease caused
by the virus was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
CoVs are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded positive￾sense RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales and infect a
broad range of mammalian and avian species, causing respiratory
or enteric diseases. CoVs have a major surface protein, the spike (S)
protein, which initiates infection by receptor binding and fusion of
the viral lipid envelope with cellular membranes. Like fusion
proteins of many other viruses, the S protein is activated by cellular
proteases. Activation of CoV S is a complex process that requires
proteolytic cleavage of S at two distinct sites, S1/S2 and S29 (Fig 1),
generating the subunits S1 and S2 that remain non-covalently
linked (1, 2, 3). The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding do￾main, whereas the S2 subunit is membrane-anchored and harbors
the fusion machinery. Cleavage at the S29 site, located immediately
upstream of the hydrophobic fusion peptide, has been proposed to
trigger the membrane fusion activity of S (4, 5). In contrast, the
relevance of S cleavage at the S1/S2 site is not yet fully understood.
Processing of CoV S is believed to occur sequentially, with cleavage
at the S1/S2 site occurring first and subsequent cleavage at S29.
Cleavage at the S1/S2 site may be crucial for conformational
changes required for receptor binding and/or subsequent expo￾sure of the S29 site to host proteases at the stage of virus entry
(reviewed in references 6, 7, and 8).
Many proteases have been found to activate CoVs in vitro, in￾cluding furin, cathepsin L, and trypsin-like serine proteases such as
the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS11A, and
TMPRSS11D (reviewed in references 6, 7, and 8). Among them,
TMPRSS2 and furin play major roles in proteolytic activation of a
broad range of viruses (reviewed in references 9, 10, and 11).
TMPRSS2 is a type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) that is
widely expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastroin￾testinal, and urogenital tract (11, 12). The physiological role of
TMPRSS2 is yet unknown, but TMPRSS2-deficient mice lack a dis￾cernible phenotype suggesting functional redundancy (13). In 2006,
we first identified TMPRSS2 as a virus-activating protease, by
demonstrating that it cleaves the surface glycoprotein HA of human
influenza A viruses (14). Subsequently, TMPRSS2 was shown to
activate the fusion proteins of a number of other respiratory

viruses, including human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza
viruses, and CoVs, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)-CoV in vitro (reviewed in references 8 and 11).
TMPRSS2 cleaves at single arginine or lysine residues (R/K↓), and
hence, activates viral fusion proteins at the so called monobasic
cleavage sites. More recent studies by us and others demonstrated
that TMPRSS2-deficient mice do not suffer from pathology when
infected with certain influenza A virus strains, SARS-CoV and MERS￾CoV due to inhibition of proteolytic activation of progeny virus and
consequently inhibition of virus spread along the respiratory tract
(15, 16, 17, 18). These studies identified TMPRSS2 as an essential host
cell factor for these respiratory viruses and further demonstrated
that inhibition of virus activating host cell proteases, particularly
TMPRSS2, provides a promising approach for the development of
therapeutics to treat respiratory virus infections. The proprotein
convertase furin is a type I transmembrane protein that is ubiq￾uitously expressed in eukaryotic tissues and cells. Furin cleaves
the precursors of a broad range of proteins, including hormones,
growth factors, cell surface receptors, and adhesion molecules
during their transport along the secretory pathway at multibasic
motifs of the preferred consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R↓ (reviewed
in reference 10). Moreover, furin has been identified as an activating
protease for the fusion proteins of a broad range of viruses, in￾cluding highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIV), HIV,
Ebola virus, measles virus, and yellow fever virus as well as bacterial
toxins such as Shiga toxin or anthrax toxin at multibasic motifs
(reviewed in references 9, 10, and 19). Acquisition of a multibasic
cleavage site by insertion of basic amino acids has long been known
to be a prime determinant of avian influenza A virus pathogenicity
in poultry. Activation of the surface glycoprotein HA of HPAIV by
furin supports systemic spread of infection with often lethal out￾come. In contrast, the HA of low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses
(LPAIV) is activated at a monobasic cleavage site by trypsin-like serine
proteases. Appropriate proteases are believed to be expressed only in
the respiratory and intestinal tract of birds, confining spread of in￾fection to these tissues.
Recent studies indicate that TMPRSS2 is also involved in SARS￾CoV-2 S protein activation (20, 21). Transient expression of TMPRSS2
in Vero cells supports cathepsin-independent entry of SARS-CoV-2
pseudotypes. Moreover, pretreatment of human Caco-2 colon and
human airway cells with the broad range inhibitor camostat
mesylate, which can inhibit TMPRSS2 activity, markedly reduced the
entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as vesicular stomatitis virus pseudo￾types containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. This suggests that a
trypsin-like serine protease is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 entry into
these cells. However, sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein suggests that furin may also be involved in S processing (Fig
1B; (22, 23)). The S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains an
insertion of four amino acids providing a minimal furin cleavage
site (R-R-A-R685↓) in contrast to the S protein of SARS-CoV. Instead,
similar to SARS-CoV the S29 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2, S pos￾sesses a paired dibasic motif with a single KR segment (KR815↓) that
is recognized by trypsin-like serine proteases.
In the present study, we demonstrate that the S protein of SARS￾CoV-2 is activated by TMPRSS2 and furin. We also show that in￾hibitors against both proteases strongly suppress virus replication
in human airway epithelial cells and that the combination of both
types of inhibitors produces a synergistic effect on virus reduction.
Our results show that this approach has considerable therapeutic
potential for treatment of COVID-19.
Results
Cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET)-substrates by furin
The S1/S2 cleavage site of the novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has been
shown to possess a minimal furin consensus motif of the sequence
R-R-A-R↓ with an alanine instead of a basic residue in the P2
position (Fig 1B; (22, 23)). Only few furin substrates possess a
nonbasic residue in the P2 position, such as Pseudomonas aeru￾ginosa exotoxin A or Shiga toxin (10, 19). To test, whether the S1/S2
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is efficiently cleaved by furin,
a small series of FRET substrates was synthesized (Fig 2A). All
compounds possess a 3-nitrotyrosine amide as P49 residue and a 2-
amino-benzoyl fluorophore in the P7 position. The analogous se￾quences of the S proteins from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and avian
infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain Beaudette were prepared as
reference substrates. Moreover, two FRET substrates of the SARS￾CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site with P2 A → K and A → R mutations were
synthesized, to evaluate whether they could constitute even more
efficient cleavage sites for furin than the wild type. The FRET
substrates were tested in an enzyme kinetic assay with human
furin, and their cleavage efficiency is shown in Fig 2B. The FRET
substrate of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site was efficiently
cleaved by recombinant furin. In contrast, the monobasic SARS-CoV
FRET substrate was not processed by furin. The MERS-CoV S1/S2
FRET substrate possessing a dibasic R-X-X-R motif was cleaved by
furin ~10-fold less efficiently than the best substrates of this FRET

TMPRSS2 and furin activate SARS-CoV-2 Bestle et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000786 vol 3 | no 9 | e202000786 2 of 14

series. The FRET substrate SARS-CoV-2_M1, which contains an
optimized furin recognition site by virtue of an A → K mutation in
the P2 position, was cleaved with similar efficiency compared with
the wild-type sequence. However, substitution of A → R in the P2
position strongly enhanced cleavage by furin. As expected, the
analogous reference sequence of IBV was also processed by furin
very efficiently. The data show that the R-R-A-R motif at the S1/S2
cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S is efficiently cleaved by furin in vitro.
SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is cleaved by both furin and TMPRSS2
We next examined whether the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is cleaved by
endogenous furin in HEK293 cells. Cells were transiently transfected
with pCAGGS plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with a
C-terminal Myc-6xHis-tag and incubated in the absence and
presence of the potent synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 (cf. Fig S1;
manuscript describing its synthesis submitted). At 48 h post
transfection, cell lysates were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western
blot analysis using antibodies against the Myc epitope. As shown in
Fig 2C (left panel), the uncleaved precursor S and the S2 subunit
were detected in the absence of MI-1851, indicating that S is cleaved
by endogenous proteases at the S1/S2 site in HEK293 cells. In
contrast, S cleavage was efficiently prevented by MI-1851. The S1
subunit cannot be detected by the Myc-specific antibody (cf. Fig 1A).
However, S cleavage was not prevented by the trypsin-like serine
protease inhibitor aprotinin (Fig 2C, right panel, lane 2). Thus, the
data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is cleaved by furin at the
S1/S2 site in HEK293 cells.
We then investigated SARS-CoV-2 S cleavage by TMPRSS2. Be￾cause HEK293 cells do not express endogenous TMPRSS2 (un￾published data; see also www.proteinatlas.org), we co-transfected
the cells with pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHis and pCAGGS-TMPRSS2. Then,
the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of MI-1851 to
suppress S cleavage by endogenous furin. Interestingly, two S
cleavage products of ~95 and 80 kD, respectively, were detected
upon co-expression of TMPRSS2 in the absence of MI-1851 (Fig 2C,
left panel), most likely S2 and S29, as they can both be detected by
the Myc-specific antibody (cf. Fig 1A). In the presence of MI-1851,
only a minor S2 protein band was detected. However, the amount of
S29 protein present in transient TMPRSS2-expressing cells was
similar in MI-1851–treated and untreated cells, suggesting that S
cleavage at the S29 site is only caused by TMPRSS2 activity. The
small amount of S2 protein detected in TMPRSS2-expressing cells in
the presence of MI-1851 was likely due to residual furin activity
rather than cleavage of S at the S1/S2 site by TMPRSS2. Cleavage of S
by TMPRSS2 at the S29 site was further supported by the reduction
of S29 protein in aprotinin treated cells (Fig 2C, right panel). To￾gether, the data show that SARS-CoV-2 S can be cleaved by furin
and by TMPRSS2. The data further suggest that the proteases cleave
S at different sites with furin processing the S1/S2 site and TMPRSS2
cleaving at the S29 site.
Knockdown of TMPRSS2 prevents proteolytic activation and
multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway epithelial
cells
Next, we investigated whether TMPRSS2 is involved in proteolytic
activation and multicycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 hu￾man airway epithelial cells. To specifically knockdown TMPRSS2
activity, we previously developed an antisense peptide-conjugated
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) (25). PPMOs are

incubated in the absence or presence of aprotinin or furin inhibitor MI-1851 (50 μM
each) for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blot
analysis using antibodies against the C-terminal Myc-tag. For each Western blot

was used as loading control.

TMPRSS2 and furin activate SARS-CoV-2 Bestle et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000786 vol 3 | no 9 | e202000786 3 of 14

single-stranded nucleic acid–like compounds, composed of a
morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating
peptide, and can interfere with gene expression by sterically
blocking complementary RNAs. PPMOs are water-soluble and
achieve entry into cells and tissues without assisted delivery
(reviewed in references 26 and 27). The previously developed PPMO
T-ex5 interferes with splicing of TMPRSS2 pre-mRNA, resulting in the
production of mature mRNA lacking exon 5 and consequently
expression of a truncated TMPRSS2 form that is enzymatically in￾active. Using T-ex5 PPMO-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity,
we were able to identify TMPRSS2 as the major influenza A virus
activating protease in Calu-3 cells and primary human airway
epithelial cells and of influenza B virus in primary human type II
pneumocytes (25, 28).
Here, Calu-3 cells were treated once with T-ex5 PPMO for 24 h
before infection with SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit the production of
normal TMPRSS2-mRNA and deplete enzymatically active TMPRSS2
present in the cells. The cells were then inoculated with SARS-CoV-2
at a low MOI of 0.001, further incubated without additional PPMO
treatment for 72 h, and then fixed and immunostained using a
rabbit serum originally produced against 2002 SARS-CoV. As shown
in Fig 3A, a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) and efficient spread of
SARS-CoV-2 infection was visible in Calu-3 cells treated with a
negative-control PPMO of nonsense sequence designated as
“scramble” as well as untreated cells that were used as controls. In
contrast, no CPE and only small foci of infection were observed in
T-ex5 PPMO-treated cells at 72 h p.i. (Fig 3A). To examine SARS-CoV-2
activation and multicycle replication in PPMO-treated cells in more
detail, Calu-3 cells were treated with PPMO for 24 h before infection,
then inoculated with virus at an MOI of 0.001 for 1 h 30 min, and
incubated for 72 h in the absence of further PPMO, as described
above. At different time points, virus titers in supernatants were
determined by tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID50) end point
dilution. T-ex5 PPMO treatment dramatically reduced virus titers in
Calu-3 cells, by 500- and 2,000-fold at 16 and 24 h p.i., respectively,
and 90-fold at 48 h p.i. (Fig 3B).
To confirm knockdown of enzymatically active TMPRSS2 ex￾pression, Calu-3 cells were treated with PPMO or remained un￾treated for 24 h, after which TMPRSS2-specific mRNA was isolated
and analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously (25). Total RNA was
analyzed with primers designed to amplify nucleotides 108–1,336 of
TMPRSS2-mRNA. A full-length PCR product of 1,228 bp was amplified
from untreated and scramble PPMO-treated Calu-3 cells, whereas a
shorter PCR fragment of about 1,100 bp was amplified from T-ex5
PPMO-treated cells (Fig 3C). Sequencing revealed that the truncated
TMPRSS2-mRNA lacked the entire exon 5 (data not shown). To
further confirm that T-ex5 PPMO single dose treatment before
infection still interferes with TMPRSS2-mRNA splicing at 72 h p.i.,
total RNA was isolated from infected cells at 72 h p.i. and amplified
as described above. As shown in Fig 3C, most TMPRSS2-mRNA
amplified from T-ex5-treated cells at 72 h p.i. lacked exon 5. The
data demonstrate that T-ex5 was very effective at producing exon
skipping in TMPRSS2-pre-mRNA and, thus, at inhibiting expression of
enzymatically active protease, during the virus growth period in Calu-3
cells. However, a small band of the full-length PCR product was visible
after 72 h p.i., indicating low levels of expression of enzymatically active
TMPRSS2 at later time points of the virus growth period, which may
explain the increase in virus titers observed at 48 h p.i. (cf. Fig 3B). Cell
viability was not affected by T-ex5 PPMO treatment of Calu-3 cells, as
shown in Fig 3D and described previously (25, 28).
Together, our data identify TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor es￾sential for SARS-CoV-2 activation and multiplication in Calu-3 cells
and show that down-regulation of TMPRSS2 activity dramatically
blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication.

TMPRSS2 and furin activate SARS-CoV-2 Bestle et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000786 vol 3 | no 9 | e202000786 4 of 14

Inhibition of either TMPRSS2 or furin activity suppresses
multicycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial
cells
We next investigated the efficacy of different inhibitors of trypsin￾like serine proteases, also inhibiting TMPRSS2, on preventing SARS￾CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells. We used the natural
broad-range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin from bovine lung
and two prospective peptide mimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2, MI-432
(29), and MI-1900 (Fig S1). Aprotinin has long been known to prevent
proteolytic activation and multiplication of influenza A virus in cell
cultures and mice. Furthermore, inhalation of aerosolized aprotinin
by influenza patients markedly reduced the duration of symptoms
without causing side effects (30). MI-432 was shown to efficiently
inhibit proteolytic activation and multiplication of influenza A virus
in Calu-3 cells (31). The inhibitor MI-1900 is a monobasic and
structurally related analog of the dibasic inhibitor MI-432.
To examine the antiviral efficacy of the protease inhibitors
against SARS-CoV-2, Calu-3 cells were infected with the virus at a
low MOI of 0.001 for 1 h 30 min, after which the inoculum was
removed and the cells incubated in the presence of the inhibitors at
the indicated concentrations for 72 h. The cells were fixed and
immunostained using an antiserum against 2002 SARS-CoV. As
shown in Fig 4, strong CPE, with holes visible throughout the
monolayer, and efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was ob￾served in Calu-3 cells in the absence of protease inhibitors. Spread
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-induced CPE was efficiently
inhibited by aprotinin treatment in a dose-dependent manner and
only a few virus-positive cells were visible in Calu-3 cultures treated
with 20 and 50 μM aprotinin. Even at a lower concentration of 10 μM,
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was greatly reduced and CPE markedly
prevented. Treatment with peptide mimetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI￾432 and MI-1900 also strongly prevented SARS-CoV-2 multiplication
and CPE in Calu-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, although less
potently than aprotinin. At 20 or 50 μM of MI-432 or MI-1900, only
small foci of infection were visible. At a concentration of 10 μM, virus
spread and CPE in MI-432– or MI-1900–treated cells were still re￾duced compared with control cells. The data demonstrate that
SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in Calu-3 human airway cells can be
strongly suppressed by aprotinin and the synthetic TMPRSS2 in￾hibitors MI-432 and MI-1900.
The observed efficient cleavage of transient expressed SARS￾CoV-2 S protein by furin in HEK293 cells prompted us to investigate if
furin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells. Hence,
virus spread in Calu-3 cells was analyzed in the presence of the
furin inhibitor MI-1851. Interestingly, MI-1851 strongly inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 spread at even the lowest concentration of 10 μM,
indicating that furin is critical for SARS-CoV-2 activation and
multiplication in these cells (Fig 4). Finally, to examine whether
endosomal cathepsins are involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in
Calu-3 cells, multicycle virus replication was determined in the
presence of the cathepsin inhibitor E64d. Cathepsin L was shown to
cleave the S protein of 2002 SARS-CoV S close to the S1/S2 site
(R667) at T678 in vitro (2). Here, strong CPE and foci of infection were
observed in E64d-treated cells even at the highest dose of 50 μM,
similar to that observed in DMSO-treated as well as untreated
control cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells is
independent of endosomal cathepsins.
In sum, our data demonstrate that inhibition of either TMPRSS2
or furin strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway cells,
indicating that both proteases are critical for S activation. In
contrast, endosomal cathepsins are dispensable or not involved at
all in SARS-CoV-2 activation in these cells.
Growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in protease inhibitor–treated
Calu-3 cells
To analyze inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activation and multiplication
by the different protease inhibitors in more detail, we performed
virus growth kinetics in inhibitor-treated cells. Calu-3 cells were
inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001 and then incubated
Figure 4. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in human airway cells by
inhibitors of furin and TMPRSS2.
Calu-3 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a low MOI of 0.001 and then
incubated in the presence of inhibitors of TMPRSS2 (aprotinin, MI-432, and MI￾1900), furin (MI-1851), and endosomal cathepsins (E64d), respectively, at the
indicated concentrations. Cells were fixed and immunostained using a rabbit
serum against SARS-CoV at 72 h p.i. Virus-positive cells are stained in blue or dark
gray depending on the staining intensity. Cells infected in the absence of
inhibitors (w/o), in the presence of DMSO (0.5%) and noninfected cells (mock)
were used as controls. Scale bars indicate 500 μm. Images are representatives of
three independent experiments.

and MI-1900), furin (MI-1851), and endosomal cathepsins (E64d), respectively, or DMSO (0.5%), at the indicated concentrations. At 16, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (p.i.),
supernatants were collected, and virus replication was determined by tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID50) titration at indicated time points. Data are mean values ±
SD of three to five independent experiments. (B) Effect of inhibitor treatment on cell viability. Calu-3 cells were treated with the indicated protease inhibitor (50 μM) for
72 h. Untreated cells (w/o) and DMSO treated cells were used as controls. Cell viability of untreated cells was set as 100%. Results are mean values ± SD (n = 3). (C) Antiviral

in the presence of 10 or 50 μM of the different protease inhibitors. At
16, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i., the viral titer in supernatants was determined
by TCID50 titration. Untreated cells and cells treated with DMSO
alone were used as controls. SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers
within 24–48 h in untreated and DMSO-treated cells Calu-3 cells (Fig
5A). Aprotinin suppressed virus replication 25- to 100-fold com￾pared with control cells even at a concentration of 10 μM at 16-48 h
p.i. The TMPRSS2 inhibitor MI-432 only slightly affected virus rep￾lication at a concentration of 10 μM but reduced virus titers 75-fold
at 24 h p.i. at 50 μM. Treatment of cells with TMPRSS2 inhibitor MI￾1900 reduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner and caused
strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication at 50 μM with 35- to 280-
fold reduced viral titers compared with control cells. The furin
inhibitor MI-1851 efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 multiplication
in Calu-3 cells, producing a 30- to 190-fold reduction in virus titers
at a dose of 10 μM. In contrast, virus multiplication was not affected
by treatment with the cathepsin inhibitor E64d, consistent with the
data shown in Fig 4. To provide evidence that inhibition of SARS￾CoV-2 replication in inhibitor-treated cells was not caused by cy￾totoxic effects, we analyzed cell viability in Calu-3 cells treated with
50 μM of the different inhibitors for 72 h. As shown in Fig 5B, eval￾uation of cell viability revealed no significant cytotoxicity by any of
the inhibitors under conditions used in the virus growth experiments.
The data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be effi￾ciently reduced by inhibiting either TMPRSS2 or furin activity,
demonstrating that both proteases are crucial for SARS-CoV-2
activation.
Treatment of SARS-CoV-2–infected Calu-3 cells with a
combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors
Finally, we wished to examine whether the combination of inhib￾itors against TMPRSS2 and furin shows a synergistic antiviral effect.
Therefore, Calu-3 cells were infected with virus as described above
and incubated in the presence of aprotinin, MI-432, or MI-1900 in
combination with MI-1851 at 10 and 50 μM each, respectively, for
72 h. Virus titers in supernatants were determined at indicated time
points. Single-dose treatment of each inhibitor and untreated cells
were used as controls. As shown in Fig 5C, the combination of 10 μM
of MI-1851 with either aprotinin or MI-432 showed enhanced an￾tiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and 10- to 30-fold reduced virus
titers compared with 10 μM of each inhibitor alone and also re￾duced viral titer four to eightfold more than that observed with
either of the single inhibitors at 50 μM. A combination of 50 μM each
of MI-432 and MI-1851 reduced virus titers 10- to 32-fold compared
with 50 μM of each inhibitor alone and thereby dramatically
suppressed SARS-CoV-2 multiplication 100- to 250-fold compared
with untreated or DMSO-treated cells. In contrast, treatment of
Calu-3 cells with 50 μM each of MI-1851 and aprotinin did not cause
further suppression of virus titers compared with the combination
of 10 μM of each inhibitor. The combination of 10 μM each of MI-1851
and MI-1900 did not show enhanced antiviral activity compared
with single inhibitor treatments at 10 μM. However, treatment of
cells with 50 μM each of MI-1900 and MI-1851 caused fivefold re￾duction in viral titers when compared with cells treated with 50 μM
of each inhibitor alone and thereby SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in
Calu-3 cells was markedly reduced compared to control cells. We
furthermore examined the antiviral activity of a combination of
T-ex5 PPMO and furin inhibitor MI-1851 against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu￾3 cells. As shown in Fig 5D, combined treatment of Calu-3 cells with
25 μM T-ex5 PPMO and 50 μM MI-1851 almost completely blocked
SARS-CoV-2 replication with a nearly 15,000-fold reduction in virus
titers at 24 h p.i., and reduced virus titers 500-fold at 48 h p.i.
compared with control cells. Combination of T-ex5 and MI-1851 was
synergistic and caused 30- to 10-fold lower virus titers at 16 and 24 h
p.i. compared with single inhibitor-treated cells. The data demonstrate
that efficient inhibition of S cleavage by a combination of TMPRSS2 and
furin inhibitors can dramatically block SARS-CoV-2 replication in hu￾man airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, our data show that combi￾nation of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors can act synergistically to
produce inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activation and multiplication at
lower doses than single protease inhibitor treatment.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and
furin cleave the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and are essential for efficient
virus multicycle replication in Calu-3 human airway cells. The re￾sults indicate that TMPRSS2 and furin cleave S at different
sites—furin at the S1/S2 site and TMPRSS2 at the S29 site—and
suggest that TMPRSS2 and furin cannot compensate for each other
in SARS-CoV-2 S activation. Our data further demonstrate that
inhibition of either one of these critical proteases can render the S
protein of SARS-CoV-2 unable to efficiently mediate virus entry and
membrane fusion and, therefore, provides a promising therapeutic
approach for treatment of COVID-19.
Discussion
Proteolytic processing of CoV S is a complex process that requires
cleavage at two different sites and is yet not fully understood. The
amino acid sequence at the S1/S2 and S29 cleavage sites varies
among CoVs (Fig 1B), suggesting that differing proteases may be
involved in activation of different CoVs. Sequence analyses of the S
protein of the emerged SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the R-R-A-R
motif at the S1/S2 site may be sensitive to cleavage by furin,
whereas the S29 site contains a single R residue that can be cleaved
by trypsin-like serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 (20, 22, 23). In the
present study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is
cleaved by furin and by TMPRSS2. Furthermore, we show that
activity of combinations of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells. Calu-3 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of
0.001 as described above and then incubated in the presence of single protease inhibitors or inhibitor combinations at the indicated concentrations. Virus titers in
supernatants were determined by TCID50 at 16, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. Data are mean values ± SD of three independent experiments. (D) Calu-3 cells were treated with PPMO
for 24 h, then infected with SARS-CoV-2 as described above and incubated in the absence of PPMO (w/o, scramble and T-ex5) and with or without 50 μM of furin inhibitor
treatment (MI-1851) for 72 h. At 16, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i., supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by TCID50 at indicated time points. Data are mean values
± SD (n = 2).

multicycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway cells is
strongly suppressed by inhibiting TMPRSS2 and furin activity,
demonstrating that both proteases are crucial for S activation in
these cells. Our data indicate that furin cleaves at the S1/S2 site,
whereas TMPRSS2 cleaves at the S29 site. The effective processing of
the S1/S2 site by furin was additionally confirmed by comparing the
cleavage rates of various FRET substrates derived from the P6-P39
segments of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs. The data clearly revealed
that due to the 4-mer PRRA insertion, a well-suited furin cleavage
site exists in the S of SARS-CoV-2, which is similarly cleaved as the
sequence from the IBV CoV, whereas the analogous substrate of
SARS-CoV is not processed by furin. Strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2
replication in Calu-3 cells by synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 fur￾thermore suggests that TMPRSS2 does not compensate for furin
cleavage at the S1/S2 site. Likewise, strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2
replication by knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity using T-ex5 PPMO or
treatment of Calu-3 cells with aprotinin, MI-432 and MI-1900, re￾spectively, indicates that furin cannot compensate for the lack of
TMPRSS2 in S activation. This was further confirmed by using an
analogous FRET substrate derived from the S29 cleavage site of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig S2). Kinetic measurements clearly
revealed that this substrate cannot be cleaved by furin (Fig S2).
Thus, we could experimentally demonstrate for the first time that
furin only activates the S1/S2 site, as expected from the amino acid
sequence at the cleavage sites (22, 23). Together, our data indicate
that furin and TMPRSS2 cleave S at different sites and that cleavage
by both proteases is crucial to render the S protein active for
mediating virus entry and membrane fusion (Fig 6). Iwata￾Yoshikawa et al (2019) (18) showed that TMPRSS2-deficient mice
do not develop disease symptoms when infected with SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV (18). The data demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is es￾sential for multicycle replication and spread of these CoVs in a
manner similar to what we and others have observed for certain
influenza A virus strains (15, 16, 17). However, it remains to be
determined whether knockout of TMPRSS2 prevents cleavage of the
S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at both sites, S1/S2 and S29,
or whether another protease is involved in S cleavage, similar to
what we have observed here for SARS-CoV-2.
In cell culture, CoVs can enter cells via two distinct routes: the
late endosome where S is cleaved by cathepsins or via the cell
surface or early endosome using trypsin-like proteases for S
cleavage ((2, 32) reviewed in reference 7). However, several recent
studies revealed that clinical isolates of human CoV (HCoV) achieve
activation by trypsin-like serine proteases and use endosomal
cathepsins only in the absence of suitable trypsin-like proteases in
cell culture (33, 34). Thus, activation by cathepsins appears to be a
mechanism that is acquired by the virus during multiple passaging
in cell cultures (34). Congruently, Zhou et al (2015) (35) showed that
SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice was strongly prevented by
camostat, a broad-range inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases,
but not by inhibitors of endosomal cathepsins (35). Here, we show
that the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, which also inhibits ca￾thepsin L and B, did not affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3
cells, indicating that endosomal cathepsins are dispensable or not
involved at all in SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells.
The presence of a multibasic cleavage site that is processed by
ubiquitously expressed furin and, therefore, supports systemic
spread of infection, has long been known to be an important
determinant of the pathogenicity of HPAIV as well as virulent strains
of Newcastle disease virus in poultry (reviewed in references 11 and
36). The S protein of IBV strain Beaudette contains multibasic motifs
at the S1/S2 and S29 site (Fig 1B). IBV belongs to the genus Gam￾macoronavirus and causes a highly contagious, acute respiratory
disease of chickens. Cleavage of IBV S protein by furin at the S29 site
has been associated with neurotropism in chicken (37). Congru￾ently, here, FRET substrates of the S1/S2 and S29 site of the IBV
Beaudette S protein were efficiently cleaved by furin (Figs 2B and
S2B). However, the contribution of furin-cleavable multibasic motifs
at the S1/S2 and/or S29 site with regard to multicycle replication,
cellular tropism, and pathogenicity of HCoVs remains to be de￾termined. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 possess a furin cleavage
motif at the S1/S2 site. In contrast, the S proteins of the 2002 SARS￾CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 possess single arginine residues at
both cleavage sites (see also Figs 2B and S2A). Interestingly, among
the S proteins of the seven CoV infecting humans, only SARS-CoV S
lacks the 4-mer insertion at the S1/S2 site (Fig 1B; (23)). The S protein
of MERS-CoV contains a dibasic motif of the sequence R-X-X-R at
both S1/S2 and S29 sites. However, it is still controversial whether
MERS-CoV is activated by furin in human airway epithelial cells (38,
39, 40, 41). Other proteases such as the serine protease matriptase/
ST14, which also prefers sequences with arginine in the P1 and P4
position, might be involved. Matriptase is expressed in a broad
range of cells and tissues and has been shown to activate the HA of
H9N2 influenza A viruses possessing the cleavage site motif R-S-S-R
((42), reviewed in reference 11). Interestingly, a study by Park et al.
indicated that cleavage of MERS-CoV S by furin or other proprotein

furin.
(i) S must be cleaved at two sites, S1/S2 and S29, to trigger fusion of viral and
cellular membranes during virus entry to release the virus genome into the host
cell. CoV S cleavage is believed to occur sequentially, with cleavage at the S1/S2
site occurring first and subsequent cleavage at the S29 site. Furin processes the
S1/S2 site, whereas TMPRSS2 cleaves at the S29 site, and both proteases cannot
compensate each other. Inhibition of either furin (ii) or TMPRSS2 (iii) or
simultaneous inhibition of both proteases (iv) renders the S protein fusion￾inactive and prevents virus entry. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 prevents exposure of the
fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the S29 subunit (iii, iv). Inhibition of furin
cleavage at the S1/S2 site may directly interfere with virus entry and membrane
fusion by steric blockage of conformational changes (ii, upper scheme) or may
prevent exposure of the S29 site to TMPRSS2 (ii, lower scheme).

convertases at the S1/S2 site takes place in virus-producing cells
before virus release and can impact the cellular localization of
membrane fusion and virus entry into a new cell (43). Cleavage of
MERS-CoV at the S1/S2 site was postulated as a prerequiste for
subsequent cleavage of S at the S29 site by host proteases present
at the surface or in early endosomes of human airway cells, thus
facilitating virus entry independent of S cleavage by cathepsins in
the late endosome. However, other HCoVs, including the 2002 SARS￾CoV, are reportedly released with non-cleaved S from infected cells.
Hence, S cleavage at both sites, S1/S2 and S29, has to take place at
the stage of entry of these viruses.
The present study demonstrates that TMPRSS2 and furin are
promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Furin and/or
TMPRSS2 inhibitors could be used alone or in combination to target
either or both of these proteases. The TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432
and MI-1900 as well as the furin inhibitor MI-1851 provide promising
compounds for further drug development. MI-1900 and MI-1851
markedly reduced virus titers even at 72 h p.i., although the cells
were treated only once after the inoculum was removed. In
aprotinin- or MI-432–treated cells, an increase in viral titers was
observed at 48 h p.i., and at 72 h p.i., virus titers were similar to
control cells. An additional treatment of cells with protease in￾hibitors at 24 h p.i. may well have supported efficient blockage of
virus inhibition and multiplication at later time points. This needs to
be investigated in more detail in future studies. In search for suitable
antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections, protease inhibitors
that have been approved for other applications may be promising for
drug repurposing to treat COVID-19. Aprotinin is a broad range serine
protease inhibitor isolated from bovine lung, used as a fibrinolysis
inhibitor to reduce perioperative bleeding (reviewed in reference 44)
and has long been known to inhibit influenza A virus activation and
replication in cell culture and in mice in vivo (30). In a clinical trial,
inhalation of aerosolized aprotinin in patients with influenza and
parainfluenza markedly reduced the duration of symptoms without
causing side effects (30). Thus, aprotinin is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2
worthy of consideration for further testing and possible development
as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. Another promising TMPRSS2
inhibitor candidate for COVID-19 treatment is the broad range
protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is approved for the
treatment of pancreatitis (45, 46). Camostate mesylate has been
shown to efficiently inhibit replication of different CoV in cell culture
and experimentally infected mice (35, 47, 48). Recently, Hoffmann
et al (2020) (20) showed that pretreatment of human Caco-2 colon
cells and human airway cells with camostat mesylate markedly
reduced entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as vesicular stomatitis virus
pseudotypes containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (20).
However, it should be noted that all of these compounds inhibit
numerous trypsin-like serine proteases and thus may cause various
adverse effects. A specific inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity during an
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection would provide the most promising
approach to reduce side effects by inhibiting virus activation by
host cell proteases. TMPRSS2-deficient mice show no discernible
phenotype, indicating functional redundancy or compensation of
physiological functions by other protease(s) in the host (13). Un￾fortunately, there is no crystal structure of TMPRSS2 available so far,
which prohibits a rational structure-based design of more efficient
inhibitors of this protease. However, first homology models have
been established, which may help for the development of improved
TMPRSS2 inhibitors in the future (49, 50 Preprint).
PPMO are highly selective inhibitors of target gene expression.
They bind to a complementary sequence in target mRNA and can
affect gene expression by steric blockage of translation initiation or
pre-mRNA splicing. The demonstration of T-ex5 PPMO efficacy in
the present study suggests that reducing TMPRSS2 expression by
use of an mRNA-directed approach in general and by PPMO in
particular is worthy of further consideration. Importantly, in various
experimental animal models of other respiratory virus infections
and disease, PPMO were able to be transported to lung tissue after
intranasal administration and produced strong reductions in virus
growth and virus-induced pathology (51, 52, 53, 54).
Very effective furin inhibitors containing a C-terminal 4-amidi￾nobenzylamide residue have been developed in recent years.
Several of these analogs have been successfully used to inhibit the
replication of numerous furin dependent human pathogenic vi￾ruses such as H5N1 influenza A virus, Chikungunya virus, West Nile
virus and dengue-2 virus, mumps virus or respiratory syncytial virus
(reviewed in references 49, 55, and 56). So far, these inhibitors have
been used only in virus-infected cell cultures and not in animal
models. However, the less potent furin inhibitor hexa-D-arginine
has been used in mice and rats and protected them against P.
aeruginosa exotoxin A and anthrax toxemia (57, 58). Therefore, it
can be speculated that a specific furin inhibition in the respiratory
tract and lungs by inhalative treatment of, for example, MI-1851 or
structurally related compounds could be possible without severe
side reactions, despite the many physiological functions of furin.
Here, the combination of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors aprotinin or MI￾432 with furin inhibitor MI-1851 showed enhanced antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway cells and supported strong
reduction of virus multiplication at lower doses compared with
treatment with each inhibitor alone. Therefore, the combination of
TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors provides a promising therapeutic
strategy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections that not only may
enhance antiviral effects but may also reduce drug toxicity and
undesirable side effects by allowing reductions of the inhibitor doses.
Notably, inhibition of TMPRSS2 and furin acts on the same target and
our data show that inhibition of S cleavage at one of the two sites is
sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication by reducing the pro￾duction of infectious progeny virus containing inactive S. Thus, the
combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors can act synergistically
until S cleavage at one or two sites is prevented. The combination of
protease inhibitors with antiviral compounds provides an approach
that may produce yet more synergistic antiviral activity at lower drug
doses and may furthermore exclude the development of drug￾resistant viruses. The combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors,
respectively, with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate
has been shown to block influenza A virus replication in human airway
cells at remarkably lower concentration of each inhibitor as compared
with single inhibitor treatment (59). Combination of a furin inhibitor
with oseltamivir carboxylate and the antiviral compounds ribavirin
and favipiravir, respectively, efficiently blocked multicycle replication
of HPAIV of subtype H5N1 and H7N1 in cell cultures (60, 61). Thus,
combination of protease inhibitors (e.g., aprotinin or camostat) and
antivirals provides a promising strategy for the treatment of COVID-19
and should be tested in cell cultures and animal models.

In summary, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 and furin are es￾sential for activation and multiplication of the novel emerged SARS￾CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells and provide promising drug
targets for treatment of COVID-19. TMPRSS2 and furin have been
shown to be involved in the proteolytic activation of a broad range
of viruses. However, the development of host protease inhibitors as
a preventative and/or therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
virus infections has been minimal to date. Our data demonstrate
the high potential of protease inhibitors as drugs for SARS-CoV-2
treatment and highlight the rationale of drug development and
repurposing of host protease inhibitors for the treatment of virus
infections in general and emerging CoV infections in particular.
Materials and Methods
Cells
Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells (HTB55; ATCC) were cultured in
DMEM-Ham F-12 medium (1:1) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS,
penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine, with fresh culture medium
replenished every 2–3 d. Vero E6 (CRL-1586; ATCC) and HEK293 (CRL￾1573; ATCC) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FCS, antibiotics, and glutamine.
Virus and plasmids
Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed under biosafety level
3 (BSL-3) conditions. The virus used in this study was SARS-CoV-2
isolate Munich 929 (kindly provided by Christian Drosten, Institute
of Virology, Charite Universit ´ atsmedizin Berlin). Virus stock was ¨
propagated on Vero E6 cells in DMEM medium with 1% FCS for 72 h.
Cell supernatant was cleared by low-speed centrifugation and
stored at −80°C.
The cDNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of isolate Wuhan￾Hu-1 (GenBank accession number MN908947; codon-optimized, se￾quence available upon request) with a C-terminal Myc-6xHis-tag was
synthesized at Eurofins and subcloned into in the pCAGGS expression
plasmid using XhoI and NheI restriction sites (pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHis).
Expression plasmid pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 encoding the cDNA of human
TMPRSS2 has been described previously (14).
Antibodies
A polyclonal serum against 2002 SARS-CoV was generated by im￾munization of rabbits with inactivated SARS-CoV. A monoclonal
mouse antibody against the C-terminal Myc-tag was purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (2276S). A monoclonal mouse anti-β
actin antibody was purchased from Abcam (ab6276). HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies were purchased from DAKO.
PPMO
Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) were synthe￾sized at Gene Tools LLC. PMO sequences (59–39) were CAGAGTTG￾GAGCACTTGCTGCCCA for T-ex5 and CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA
for scramble. The cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4 (where R is
arginine and X is 6-aminohexanoic acid) was covalently conjugated
to the 39 end of each PMO through a noncleavable linker, to produce
peptide-PMO (PPMO), by methods described previously (62).
Protease inhibitors
Aprotinin was purchased from AppliChem and the cysteine pro￾tease inhibitor E64d from Sigma-Aldrich (E8640). The synthetic in￾hibitors of TMPRSS2 and furin were synthesized in-house according
to previous methods (29, 63). Stock solutions of protease inhibitors
were prepared in double distilled water (aprotinin, MI-432, and MI￾1851) or sterile DMSO (MI-1900 and E64d) and stored at −20°C.
Synthesis of FRET substrates
The peptides were synthesized by automated solid phase peptide
synthesis on a Syro 2000 synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH) using
~100 mg Rink-amide-MBHA resin (loading 0.68 mmol/g) for each 2
ml reaction vessel and a standard Fmoc-protocol with double
couplings (approximately fourfold excess of Fmoc amino acid, HOBt
and HBTU, respectively, and 8 equiv. DIPEA, 2 × 2 h coupling time) as
described recently (64). After final coupling of Boc-2-aminobenzoic
acid, the resin was washed with 20% piperidine in DMF (5 and 15
min) to remove an acylation on the 3-nitrotyrosine (65). The
peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected by a mixture
of TFA/triisopropylsilane/water (95/2.5/2.5, vol/vol/v) over 2 h at
RT, followed by precipitation in cold diethyl ether. All peptides were
purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC to more than 95%
purity based on the detection at 220 nm and finally obtained as
lyophilized TFA salts.
Enzyme kinetic measurements with recombinant soluble human
furin
The measurements were performed in black 96-well plates (Nunc)
at RT with a microplate reader (Safire2, Tecan) at λex 320 nm and λem
405 nm. Each well contained 20 μl of the substrate solution (dis￾solved in water) and 150 μl buffer (100 mM Hepes, 0.2% Triton X-100,
2 mM CaCl2, 0.02% Natriumazid, and 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.0). The
measurements were started by addition of 20 μl furin (66) solution
(0.5 nM in assay). The measurements were performed for 5 min, and
the steady-state rates were calculated from the slopes of the
progress curves.
RNA isolation, and RT-PCR analysis of exon skipping
For analysis of TMPRSS2-mRNA from PPMO-treated Calu-3 cells,
cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations (25 μM) of
T-ex5 or scramble PPMO or without PPMO in PPMO medium (DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% BSA, antibiotics, and glutamine) for 24 h.
Total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA using the one-step RT-PCR kit
(QIAGEN) according to the supplier’s protocol. To analyze TMPRSS2-
mRNAs for exon skipping, primers TMPRSS2-108fwd (59-CTA CGA GGT
GCA TCC-39) and TMPRSS2-1336rev (59-CCA GAG GCC CTC CAG CGT CAC

1,100 bp lacking exon 5 from T-ex5-treated cells were used (25). RT￾PCR products were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide.
Infection of cells and multicycle virus replication in the presence
of protease inhibitors or PPMO
SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments of Calu-3 cells were performed in
serum-free DMEM supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics
(DMEM++). For analysis of multicycle replication kinetics Calu-3 cells
were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 90% confluence. Cells
were then inoculated with virus at an MOI of 0.001 in DMEM++ for 1 h
30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM supplemented
with 3% FCS, glutamine, and antibiotics (DMEM+++) with or without
addition of protease inhibitors or DMSO to the medium for 72 h. At
16, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (p.i.), supernatants were collected,
and viral titers were determined by tissue culture infection dose
50% (TCID50) titration as described below. In addition, cells were
fixed and immunostained against viral proteins as described below
at 72 h p.i. to evaluate virus spread and virus-induced CPE.
For PPMO treatment, Calu-3 cells were incubated with 25 μM
T-ex5 or scramble PPMO or remained untreated in PPMO medium
for 24 h before infection. Cells were infected as described above
and incubated in DMEM+++ without PPMO for 72 h.
Virus titration by TCID50
Viral supernatants were serial diluted in DMEM++. Each infection
time point was titrated in four replicates from 51 to 511. Subse￾quently, 100 μl of each virus dilution were transferred to Calu-3 cells
grown in 96-well plates containing 100 μl DMEM+++ and incubated
for 72 h. Viral titers were determined with Spearman and Karber ¨
algorithm described in reference 67.
Transient expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in HEK293 cells
For transient expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein 60% confluent
HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 1.6 μg of pCAGGS-S-Myc￾6xHis and either 15 ng of empty pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS-TMPRSS2
using Liopfectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufac￾turers protocol for 48 h. Cells were harvested and centrifuged for
5 min at 8,000g. Subsequently, cells were subjected to SDS–PAGE
and Western blot analysis as described below.
SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with PBS, lysed in CelLytic M buffer (Sigma￾Aldrich) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340; Sigma-Aldrich),
resuspended in reducing SDS–PAGE sample buffer, and heated at
95°C for 10 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE (10% ac￾rylamide gel), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (GE Healthcare), and detected by incubation with pri￾mary antibodies and species-specific peroxidase-conjugated sec￾ondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the ChemiDoc
XRS system with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Immunohistochemical staining and microscopy
To visualize viral spread in SARS-CoV-2–infected Calu-3 cells, im￾munohistochemical staining was performed. Calu-3 cells were fixed
72 h postinfection in 4% PFA for 36 h at 4°C. The cells were per￾meabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at RT.
The cells were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit serum against
2002 SARS-CoV for 1 h 30 min at RT, a species-specific peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at RT and subsequently
stained using the peroxidase substrate KPL TrueBlue (Seracare) and
further analyzed on a Leica Dmi1 microscope.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed by measuring the cellular ATP content
using the CellTiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega).
Calu-3 cells grown in 96-well plates were incubated with 25 μM of
each PPMO or 50 μM of each of the protease inhibitors for 24 and 72
h, respectively. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the sub￾strate according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was
measured using a 96-well plate (Nunc) with a luminometer (Centro
LB 960; Berthold Technologies). The absorbance values of PPMO- or
inhibitor-treated cells were converted to percentages by com￾parison with untreated control cells, which were set at 100% cell
viability.
