A B S l R A C T Abnormal estrogen metabolism has
eteln found in cirrhosis after administration of
intravenous tracers of estradiol-3H to 6 patients
and 23 healthy controls. The major abnormalities
observed involved estrogen metabolites other than
the 3 "classic" ones, i.e., estrone (El), estradiol
(E2), and estriol (E3). Urinary recovery of
radioactivity was regularly elevated in the patients,
to an average of 71 % of the dose compared to
51% in Tormals. This is considered to reflect the
component of in trahep-atic cholestasis in cirrhosis.
The per cent (lose recovered as urinary glutco￾siduronates (42%) was normal in cirrhotics in
contrast to impaired glucuronidation of cortisol
metabolites in this disease. El and E2 were present
in normial anmouints, and E3 was slightly elevated
to 21 % of the extract compared to 14%o in con￾trols. There were strikingly decreased excretion
of 2-hydroxyestronie (3% compared with normal

cirrhosis, too, is characterized by the reciprocal
relationship between decreased 2-hydroxylation
and increased 16a-hydroxylation previously de￾scribed in hypothyroidism and male breast cancer.
However, unlike these latter, the increase of 16a￾hydroxy metabolites was less than the decrease
of 2-hydroxy metabolites. The data indicate clear￾cut impairment of 2-hydroxylation, suggestive im￾pairment of 16a-hydroxylation, and a definite
dlelression of the reaction 16a-hydroxyestrone-->
estriol, the latter finding so far unique to cirrhosis.
Demonstration of abnormal peripheral metabolism
of estrogen in cirrhosis provides a new approach
to the origin of the hyperestrogenic syndrome in
this disease.
INTRODUCTION
The central role of the liver in the transformation
of steroids and the well-recognized occurrence of
a hyperestrogenic syndrome in liver disease (2)
hlave stimulated investigation of estrogen metab￾olism in liver disease. The current status has been
summarized in a recent review by Schedl (3).
Virtually all the available data have been obtained
either by bioassay or by chemical assay methods
limited to the 3 "classical" estrogen metabolites,'
El (estrone)l E2 (estradiol), and E3 (estriol).
The following trivial namiies have been used for metabolites:

(20 The Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 47 1968

The inadequacies of both methods have been well
understood by workers in the field. In addition,
studies utilizing chemical methods have been
shown to be subject to two serious limitations.
First, the three classical metal)olites together have
been shown to constitute about 40%o of the urinary
estrogens (4). Other identified metabolites, e.g.
2-hydroxyestrone, 2-methoxyestrone, 16-epiestriol,
16a-hydroxyestrone and 16-ketoestradiol, make up
most of the remainder. Studies that do not include
these compounds are incomplete and may, on occa￾sion, be misleading. It was found in the present
study that an analysis restricted to the three clas￾sical metabolites would have yielded a quite er￾roneous picture of estrogen metabolism in cir￾rhosis. Second, studies of the "urinary production
rate" of estradiol have shown discrepancies be￾tween values determined from different metabolites
(5). This indicates that the pathways of formation
of different estrogen metabolites may include vary￾ing proportions of multiple precursors, some of
which may never have been effective estrogens.
It appears, therefore, that critical evaluation of
the fate of biologically active estrogen is best ac￾complished by studies of estradiol biotransforma￾tion, with radioactive tracers. Very few studies of
this type have been reported. A preliminary com￾munication by Crowell, Ereii, and Preedy (6)
reported' nornmal estradiol l)roduction in cirrhosis,
but gave few details concerning the pathways of
estrogen metabolism. A preliminary communica￾tion by Stoa and Thorsen (7) reported little devia￾tion from normal in the estradiol metabolism of
cirrhotic patients. In a somewhat more detailed
preliminary communication, Shaver, Roginsky,
and Christy (8) reported evidence that suggested
an elevated blood estrogen level and delayed
hepatic estrogen inactivation in cirrhosis.
In the present study the metabolism of tracer
doses of radioactive estradiol was studied in six
patients with cirrhosis and was found to be con￾sistently abnormal, in total excretion, conjugation,
and the relative quantities of metabolites. De￾creased efficiency of certain pathways of peripheral
estradiol metabolism was demonstrated, and there
was increased formation of a normally minor
metabolite, 16a-hydroxyestrone. The existence of
abnormal peripheral estrogen metabolism in cir￾rhosis provides a new approach to the understand￾ing of the hyperestrogenic syndrome in this disease.
METHODS
Five men, aged 39-50, and one woman, aged 37, were
studied. Each patient had typical clinical and laboratory
findings of cirrhosis (Table I), as well as a long history
of alcoholism. At the time of study, each patient was hos￾pitalized at the Clinical Research Center and had had a
period of rest, adequate diet, and enforced abstinence from
alcohol.
Each subject studied received approximately 1 ,uc of
estradiol-6,7-'H by intravenous injection of a weighed
amount of a solution of the steroid in freshly redistilled
pyrogen-free propylene glycol. A weighed aliquot of
propylene glycol solution from which the individual
tracer doses were obtained was used for calculation of the
administered dose of radioactivity. Complete urine col￾lections as judged from the consistency of creatinine mea￾surements were obtained for 3 days after each injection.
The specimens were refrigerated immediately after void￾ing and at all times until the collection was complete.
If not processed immediately, and this was done in most
instances, the entire sample was frozen and kept at - 150C
until it was possible to separate the steroid metabolites.
The radioactive steroids used were homogeneous by iso￾topic dilution analyis. The carrier steroids used were re￾crystallized to constant melting point before addition
to the extract. Purity of carrier steroids was also checked
by thin-layer chromatography and by infrared spec￾trometry. All solvents employed were redistilled and of
high quality.
In each study the 3 day urine collections were combined
and divided into 10, 50, and 40% aliquots, of which the
last was frozen and retained. A known amount (approxi￾mately 30 mg) of carrier 2-hydroxyestrone was added
to the 10% aliquot; no carrier was added to the 50%o
aliquot. Each was incubated with 300 U of 8-glucuroni￾dase2 per ml of urine at pH 5 with acetate buffer at
380C for 5 days. The urine at pH 5 was extracted con￾tinuously with ether for 48 hr. The ether extract was
washed with 9% sodium bicarbonate solution saturated
with sodium chloride, with saturated sodium chloride solu￾tion, and finally with a very small amount of water, and
the solvent was removed. The residue is designated "glu￾cosiduronate extract." It should be noted that sulfate con￾jugates are not hydrolyzed by this procedure although
2-deoxy-2-acetamido-D-glucosides (if present) may be;
double conjugates with glucuronic and sulfuric acid would
not be cleaved to lipid-soluble compounds. These, there￾fore, would be included as "nonglucosiduronate."
The extract-from the 10% aliquot was used only for
measurement of 2-hydroxyestrone and estradiol. A known
amount of estradiol-17,8 approximately equal to the
amount of 2-hydroxyestrone was added. The mixture was
acetylated by standing overnight in pyridine and acetic
anhydride. Excess reagent was removed under a nitrogen
stream on a water bath, and the acetates were chromato￾graphed on 8 g of acid-washed alumina. Elution with 3: 2
2p.-Glucuronidase, known as Ketodase, was obtained
from Warner-Chilcott Laboratories, a division of Warner￾Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, New York.

Elution with 1: 9 (v/v) ethyl ether-benzene. gave 2-hy￾droxyestrone diacetate, which was recrystallized to con￾stant specific activity from petroleum ether-acetone. The
total radioactivity of each compound was then calculated
from the specific activity and the weight of carrier. The

One-half of the glucosiduronate extract from the 50%
aliquot was submitted to gradient elution partition chro￾matography on acid-washed celite column as described by
Engel et al. (9). This procedure yields well-defined and
homogenous peaks for 2-methoxyestrone, estrone, 16-epi￾estriol, and estriol, and the values for these compounds
were directly determined by combining the pertinent frac￾tions and measurement of radioactivity. The peak con￾taining 16a-hydroxyestrone also contains 16-ketoestradiol.

Since these two metabolites are not separable by routine
chromatographic procedures, the amount of 16a-hydroxy￾estrone was determined by reverse isotope dilution. Ali￾quots of the radioactive peak were diluted with unlabeled
carrier 16a-hydroxyestrone and then acetylated overnight
with acetic anhydride and pyridine. Purification was ac￾complished by preparative thin-layed chromatography on
silica gel, employing successive development in the sys￾tems 30% ethyl acetate: cyclohexane and 50% ethyl ace￾tate: cyclohexane. The separated 16a-hydroxyestrone ace￾tate was then crystallized to constant specific activity from
acetone: petroleum ether.
In subject CY, carrier 2-hydroxyestrone was added
to the urine which was processed in the usual manner.
The "glucosiduronate extract" was separated by counter￾current distribution, as described previously (10). Es￾tradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone were separated from the ap￾propriate tubes after carrier addition by acetylation and
chromatography, as above. The radioactivity present as
estrone, estriol, and 2-methoxyestrone was calculated from
the contents of the peak tubes. 16a-Hydroxyestrone, 16-
ketoestradiol, and 16-epiestriol are recovered together as
one area in the countercurrent distribution. The amount
of 16a-hydroxyestrone present in this study of CY was
determined by reverse isotope dilution, as above.
Radioactivity was measured in a Packard Liquid Scin￾tillation Spectrometer with appropriate corrections for
quenching. Specific activities were the mean of at least
triplicate measurements and were accurate within the
counting error of ± 5%.
RESULTS
Recovery of radioactivity (Table II). The
3 day total urinary excretion of radioactive metab￾olites was elevated to 71o% of the dose compared
with 51%o in normal men and 63%o in normal
women. This increase was confined to the first
24 hr, 56%o of the dose compared with 28%o in
normal men and 39%o in normal women. (Women

normally excrete a larger fraction of the radioac￾tive estradiol metabolites into urine, both 1st day
and 72 hr total, then do men ( 11 ).) Excretion on
the 2nd + 3rd days was somewhat less than nor￾mal, 15% compared with 24% in normal subjects
of either sex. The 72 hr recovery of radioactivity
in the glucosiduronate extract was essentially
identical in the normals and cirrhotic patients.
Thus, by difference, the cirrhotics excreted an in￾creased proportion of the dose as nonglucosiduron￾ate conjugates. These latter were nearly twice as
high in cirrhotics as in the combined normal group,
and nearly three times as high as in normal men.
Individual metabolites (Table III). The sum
of the seven analyzed metabolites was normal but
the pattern was abnormal. 2-Hydroxyestrone and
2-methoxyestrone were formed in 14 the normal
amounts; estriol formation was 50% higher than
normal, and 16a-hydroxyestrone was about twice
normal. The other three metabolites, estradiol,
estrone, and 16-epiestriol, were present in normal
amounts.
In subjects IN and NS the "nonglucosiduron￾ate" conjugates after ketodase treatment were
solvolyzed (12), and the metabolites were sep￾arated by the described procedures. It was found
that 2-methoxyestrone and 16a-hydroxyestrone
represented almost exactly the same per cent of this
extract as they did of the "glucosiduronate con￾jugates." Estriol represented a somewhat smaller
per cent of the solvolyzed extract but the amount
present would not change the total recovery of this
metabolite to any significant degree.
DISCUSSION
Estradiol metabolism of the cirrhotic patients was
abnormal in several respects. An increased fraction
of the estradiol metabolites was recovered in urine,
as a result of greater 1st day excretion, with the
2nd + 3rd day significantly below normal. The
normal course of estrogen metabolite (lisposition
offers a possible exl)lanation for these findings.
Studies with i.v. estra(liol tracers in patients with
complete biliary fistulas (13) have shown quanti￾tative recovery of radioactivity within 24 hr, about
half in bile and half in urine. This has led to the
conclusion that in intact subjects the 1st day's
urinary excretion comprises chiefly metabolites
that have not undergone biliary excretion, whereas
subsequent collections contain metabolites that
have undergone prior enterohepatic circulation. It
would be anticipated that a decrease in hepato￾biliary excretory capacity, a regular pathophysio￾logical feature of cirrhosis corresponding to the
anatomically demonstrable intrahepatic cholestasis
(14), would cause increased 1st day urinary elim￾ination of estrogen metabolites. This is analogous
to the increase of urinary bilirubin when hepato￾biliary excretory capacity is reduced in disease. In
agreement with this explanation, the highest 1st
day recovery of estrogen metabolites occurred in
the two patients with the greatest elevation of se￾rum bilirubin concentration. The decreased 2nd +

3rd day recovery in the cirrhotic patients is a
result of the large urinary loss on the 1st day,
since less of the estrogen metabolites reach the in￾testine to be available for reabsorption.
In contrast to the elevated total urinary recovery
of estrogen metabolites, the proportion excreted as
glucosiduronate conjugates was normal. This dif￾fers from cortisol metabolism in cirrhosis, where
decreased glucosiduronate conjugation of metab￾olites was observed (15). The glucosiduronate
fraction showed a normal total amount of the
seven analyzed metabolites, with an abnormal pat￾tern. There was a decrease of the 2-oxygenated
metabolites, 2-hydroxyestrone and 2-methoxy￾estrone, to % of normal, with an increase of the
16a-hydroxy metabolites. Estriol was 50% higher
than normal, and 16a-hydroxyestrone was present
in amounts more than twice normal. These changes
in estrogen metabolites do not appear to be a con￾sequence of the altered conjugation mechanisms in
cirrhosis since analysis of the "sulfate" fraction in
two patients disclosed quantities of 2-methoxy￾estrone and 16a-hydroxyestrone relatively similar
to that present in the "glucosiduronate" extract.
In order to interpret these changes, it is helpful
to consider the over-all pattern of estradiol metab￾olism (Fig. 1) (16). Estradiol forms a reversible
redox system with estrone, and all the other prod￾ucts are derived from estrone. The latter is metab￾olized along two major pathways, the 2-oxygenation
pathway (estrone -* 2-hydroxyestrone -> 2-meth￾oxyestrone) and the 16a-hydroxylation pathway
(estrone -* 16a-hydroxyestrone -> estriol). For￾mation of 16-epiestriol represents a separate minor
pathway. The relative prominence of the two
major pathways varies in disease but the sum of
the two appears to be constant in all diseases
studied so far. D)epression of one leadls to eqniv￾aleiit accetlwation of the otlher.
In cirrhosis, the decrease of 2-oxygenated metab￾olite formation was profound but there was only
a small increase in estriol formation. In this sense
the formation of estriol was relatively depressed,
since the increase was not consistent with the de￾crease in 2-oxygenated metabolites. Even when
the 16a-hydroxyestrone excretion was considered,
the increase in total 16a-hydroxy metabolite forma￾tion was only about % as great as the decrease
in 2-oxygenated metabolite formation. This con￾trasts with hypothyroidism (17) and male breast
cancer (10) where the increase in 16a-hydroxy
metabolites is equal to or slightly greater than the
decrease in 2-oxygenated metabolites. These data
suggest some impairment of the 16a-hydroxylation
reaction in cirrhosis. The ratio of 16a-hydroxy￾estrone to estriol in the cirrhotic patients was ap￾proximately twice normal and approximately five
times as high as in male breast cancer. These
results indicate inhibition or partial loss of the
dehydrogenase responsible for the reduction of
16a-hydroxyestrone to estriol.
It is tempting to relate the observed abnormal￾ities of peripheral estrogen metabolism to the
genesis of the hyperestrogenic syndrome in cir￾rhosis. An increased hormonal effect is presumably
due to elevated blood (and/or tissue) concentra￾tions of active hormone. This in turn could be due
to increased hormone production, decreased inac￾tivation, or both. Studies of radioactive estradiol
metabolism by Shaver. Roginskv. and Christy (8)
led these authors to the conclusion that blood
estrogen levels were indeed elevated in cirrhosis.
They concluded also that the elevated blood levels
occurred without elevated estrogen production, cit￾ing unpublished data of their own and a report by
Crowell, Eren, and Preedy (6) which indicated
normal estradiol production in cirrhosis, and they
speculated that the initiating cause of the hyper￾estrogenic syndrome in cirrhosis is impaired he￾patic removal of estrogen.
As Shaver et al. pointed out, their studies pro￾vided no details concerning the possible step(s)
of hepatic estrogen metabolism which might be
impaired. The present study elucidates but does
24 B. Zumoff, J. Fishman, T. F. Gallagher, and L. Hellman

not solve this problem. One of the two major
metabolic pathways that inactivate estrone, i.e. 2-
oxygenation, is clearly impaired. The status of the
other pathway, 16a-hydroxylation, is uncertain.
Of its two sequential steps, the second is definitely
impaired. The evidence concerning inhibition of the
first step is suggestive but not conclusive.
The role of the increased amounts of 16a-hy￾droxyestrone requires evaluation. If this metabolite
were estrogenic, an explanation for the hyperestro￾genic syndrome would be at hand. From animal
assays (18) the estrogenicity of 16a-hydroxy￾estrone, like that of estriol, is weak. This conclu￾sion is not necessarily transferrable to man. Direct
study of the human biological effects of 16a￾hydroxyestrone, its estrogenicity as well as the
possibility that it may inhibit 2-hydroxylation and/
or 16c-hydroxylation of estrone, seems indicated.
