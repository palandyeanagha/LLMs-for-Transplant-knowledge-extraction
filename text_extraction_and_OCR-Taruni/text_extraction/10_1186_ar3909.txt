Introduction
B-lineage cells, in particular antibody-secreting plasma 
cells (PCs), are the unique source of protective and auto￾reactive antibodies. In systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), B cells and autoantibodies, including immune com￾plexes, are considered to be intimately involved in the 
very complex pathogenesis of SLE as well as a number of 
other autoimmune diseases [1-4]. Th e appealing concept 
to ameliorate disease by abrogating autoantibody produc￾tion and thereby reducing autoantibody-dependent 
eff ector mechanisms has served as the main rationale for 
the use of B-cell-directed therapies in patients with SLE 
in addition to the inhibition of B-cell-mediated processes 
such as antigen presentation, cytokine production and 
activation of T cells. Ultimately, however, diff erentiated 
PCs largely resist these therapeutic approaches – and by 
continuing to produce autoantibodies, they appear to 
play an important immunopathogenic role by providing 
long-lived immune memory, as has been suggested by 
murine lupus models and data from SLE patients 
undergoing successful autologous stem cell transplan ta￾tion (ASCT) [5]. Th ese patients show clinical improve￾ment together with the disappearance of autoreactive 
antibodies as well as normalization of T-cell and B-cell 
abnormalities in peripheral blood [5]. Independent of the 
very intense protocols of ASCT unspecifi cally targeting 
PCs, more selective therapeutic interventions are under 
consideration (recently reviewed in detail [6]) – such as 
the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against B-cell 
surface antigens, like CD19, that may directly target PCs 
beyond other anti-B-cell approaches such as anti-CD20, 
anti-CD22 and anti-CD52 therapies (Table 1).
In addition, other principles indirectly targeting these 
cells by depriving signals required for PC growth and 
diff erentiation are also being studied (Table  2). B-cell 
activating factor (BAFF), TNFα, IL-6, IL-21, granulocyte–
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IFNα as well as 
other cytokines and signals aff ect to diff erent degrees the 
survival, diff erentiation and function of B cells [7] or PCs 
[8,9]. While in vivo data from such interventions are very 
limited, the extent of cytokine-blocking eff ects on PCs 
remains largely unknown.
Th e members of the TNF family BAFF (B-cell activating 
factor, or BlyS, B-lymphocyte stimulator, TNFSF13B) and 
APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand, TNFSF13A), 
which share receptors on B cells and PCs – that is, BAFF 
receptor (TNFRSF13C), BCMA (B-cell maturation anti￾gen, TNFRSF17) and TACI (transmembrane activator 
Abstract
Anti-CD20 therapy using rituximab directly targeting B 
cells has been approved for treatment of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis and anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides and 
has led to reappreciation of B-lineage cells for anti￾rheumatic treatment strategies. Moreover, blocking 
B-cell activating factor with belimumab, a drug that is 
licensed for treatment of active, seropositive systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), represents an alternative, 
indirect anti-B-cell approach interfering with proper 
B-cell development. While these approaches 
apparently have no substantial impact on antibody￾secreting plasma cells, challenges to improve the 
treatment of diffi cult-to-treat patients with SLE remain. 
In this context, anti-CD19 antibodies have the promise 
to directly target autoantibody-secreting plasmablasts 
and plasma cells as well as early B-cell diff erentiation 
stages not covered by anti-CD20 therapy. Currently 
known distinct expression profi les of CD19 by human 
plasma cell subsets, experiences with anti-CD19 
therapies in malignant conditions as well as the 
rationale of targeting autoreactive plasma cells in 
patients with SLE are discussed in this review.

and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, 
TNFRFS13B) – are also currently studied as therapeutic 
targets [10]. In vivo blockade of BAFF/APRIL strongly 
diminishes the mature PC compartment in mice [11], 
and inhibition of both BAFF and APRIL by TACI-Ig 
(Atacicept) has been studied in early trials with patients 
with SLE [12] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [13], provid￾ing evidence for reductions of autoreactive but also of 
total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels under treatment. 
Total Ig reductions of comparable magnitude have also 
been observed under anti-BAFF therapy with belimumab 
without aff ecting APRIL [14], leaving it open whether 
BAFF has a role in supporting survival of human PCs in 
vivo (via TACI signaling) or whether certain Ig produced 
by PCs can also be reduced by indirect targeting of their 
precursors (via BAFF receptor). Th e latter is supported 
by data demonstrating a moderate reduction of plasma￾blast numbers by ~50% in the blood of belimumab￾treated SLE patients [15]. However, the impact of 
belimumab on systemic antibody production occurred 
within a limited magnitude and with variable eff ects on 
diff erent Ig subclasses and on autoreactive versus total Ig 
levels [12-15]. Th e clinical value of belimumab in SLE 
[14] could also involve targeting of B-cell functions other 
than autoantibody production. In this regard, B-cell 
development at the stage of transitional B cells is aff ected 
by this treatment [16].
Based on the serum Ig data serving as a surrogate 
parameter for its eff ect on PCs, it is diffi cult to diff er￾entiate between the putative impact of anti-BAFF and 
TACI-Ig on mature PCs versus plasmablasts recently 
generated from activated B cells. Although no direct 
comparison exists, both strategies show partial eff ects on 
IgM, IgG and IgA production. Th ese data, however, do 
not allow a distinction between actual reduced PC 
numbers or simply a reduced capacity to produce Ig.
Overall, the clinical value of direct depletion of 
autoantibody-producing PCs in the bone marrow (BM) 
has not yet been suffi ciently addressed in autoimmunity. 
Currently available immune therapies leave these cells 
largely intact. Under rituximab treatment, tissue-resident 
and to some degree circulating ´steady-state´ PC pools 
[17-19] as well as specifi c (protective) serum Ig levels 
[20,21] remain largely stable. Another anti-CD20 therapy 
employing ocrelizumab led to some reductions in serum 
IgM, IgG and IgA levels, but the dynamics appeared 
within the normal range of Ig subclass titers [22]. Notably, 
the discordance between autoantibody reduction and 
clinical effi cacy seen in SLE patients under rituximab 
treatment raised questions about the mechanism of 
action of anti-CD20 therapy and the value of more 
substantial PC depletion beyond anti-CD20 reach [23].
Although the presence or levels of autoantibodies 
represent a surrogate for successful interventions, none 
of the above immune interventions but ASCT [5] have 
been shown to completely eradicate autoantibodies along 
with clinical remission status. An appealing hypothesis is 
therefore that successful targeting of autoreactive PCs via 
partial or complete depletion of the PC repertoire might 
constitute a therapeutic option for SLE and other auto￾immune diseases, and could provide ultimate proof for 
the concept of autoantibody-driven immunopathology.

Plasma cells and their microenvironment
PCs are destined to produce and secrete large amounts of 
specifi c antibodies, and by this means to importantly 
contribute to immune protection but also to auto￾immunity through generation of autoreactive antibodies. 
In general, PCs diff erentiate from activated B cells – a 
process infl uenced by various factors that determine the 
timing and site of PC diff erentiation and maturation (that 
is, primary vs. secondary responses, splenic vs. lymph 
node vs. ectopic diff erentiation), the localization and 
physiological role of the PCs (that is, mucosal vs. systemic 
lymphoid tissues), conferring antibody availability at 
mucosal surfaces versus blood serum [24,25], and the 
quality of antibody produced by PCs (for example, T-cell￾independent vs. T-cell-dependent responses, nature of 
antigen; recently reviewed in [7]). Mature PCs represent 
the terminal stage of B-cell diff erentiation and are 
molecularly characterized by radical remodeling of their 
transcriptional program from a paired box 5 (PAX5)/B￾cell-specifi c activator protein (BSAP)-dictated state to a 
Blimp-1 regulated state [26,27].
PCs reside in the spleen, BM and the mucosal lamina 
propria, but are also found in lymph nodes and at sites of 
autoimmune infl ammation and in circulation [3,7]. PCs 
of the BM in particular are considered to be the major 
source of serum Ig [28,29] and at the same time have 
been suggested to contain a fraction of long-lived cells 
[30,31], which might account for the observed stability of 
specifi c serum antibody titers over decades [7,32,33]. 
Such stability of Ig-producing PCs has also been demon￾strated in a lupus mouse model, including autoreactive 
PCs producing an anti-dsDNA idiotype, D42 [34]. In 
many SLE patients, anti-dsDNA IgG antibodies are 
reduced upon B-cell-depleting therapy with rituximab. 
At the same time, protective IgG but also anti-Ro and 
anti-La antibodies remain stable and hardly change after 
B-cell depletion [21,35]. Th ese observations suggest that 
some autoantibody specifi cities are produced by long￾lived PCs being refractory to rituximab treatment, while 
other specifi cities partly depend on the presence of 
CD20+ B cells and presumably the generation of new 
plasmablasts or short-lived PCs [36].
As mature PCs appear as resting cells [37,38], the 
survival of individual PCs is critical for the maintenance 
of serum Ig. PCs die rapidly when isolated ex vivo due to 
specifi c pathways of apoptosis [39], unless they receive 
molecular signals that confer their survival. Th is property 
contributed to the concept of a molecular niche that 
conditionally maintains PCs in the BM and at the same 
time limits their numbers in healthy individuals [36,40]. 
Soluble and insoluble signals such IL-5, IL-6, CXCL12, 
TNFα, APRIL and CD44 ligation have been demonstrated 
to facilitate PC survival in vitro [7,8], and various cell 
types able to produce these factors have been identifi ed 
in close proximity to PCs in the BM or spleen [9,41]. 
Th ese cell types include stromal cells [42,43], eosinophils 
[44] or myeloid precursor cells [45], megakaryocytes [46] 
and dendritic cells [41,47]. Further cell types are directly 
(or suggested to be) implicated in PC survival; for 
example, basophils [48], monocytes [49], osteoclasts [15] 
and osteoblasts [50]. In addition, Xiang and colleagues 
suggested that the inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIb ex￾pressed by PCs may regulate their survival via apoptosis 
control [51]. Notably, PCs from lupus mice lacked 
expression of FcγRIIb and were protected from apoptosis. 
Th e implications of these fi ndings for human SLE remain 
unknown. Th e regulation of PC survival probably 
employs both redundancy and synergy as regulatory 
principles, as suggested by the multitude of factors and 
cells implicated in PC survival; for example, IL-6 and 
CXCL12 could partly compensate for the absence of 
BAFF and APRIL, or vice versa. Improved understanding 
of the microarchitecture hosting PCs contributes to 
potential anti-PC approaches by depriving them of their 
survival factors.
In this context, PCs also reside in kidneys of SLE 
patients or lupus-prone NZB/W mice [52,53]. Although 
it is not known whether these cells have distinct require￾ments for their survival compared with BM PCs, their 
disappearance after resolution of infl ammation indicates

that PC survival is extrinsically regulated, including 
micro environmental requirements. Studies on cells and 
soluble factors present in ectopic sites comprising PCs 
may thus help to defi ne the essential constituents of the 
PC niche.
Conventional therapies including glucocorticoids and 
cytostatic drugs such as cyclophosphamide or myco￾pheno late motefi l have very limited impact on mature 
resting PCs, including autoreactive PCs [34,37,54,55]. 
Proteasome inhibition with bortezomib aff ecting B cells 
and PCs among various other cell types leads to 
improvement of murine SLE including suppression of 
anti-dsDNA production [56], whereas data from patients 
are still very limited [57]. Moreover, immunoablation by 
rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) combined with 
ASCT [5] represents a unique strategy to abrogate auto￾antibody production (including protective antibodies) 
and shows promise for clinical effi cacy in severe SLE. Th e 
combined clinical and laboratory data from these patients 
exemplify the critical pathogenic role of the adaptive 
immune system in SLE, and provide the proof of concept 
that immune tolerance can be re-established in these 
patients.
In this regard, CD19 appears to be a candidate target 
molecule for specifi c targeting of B cells and PCs, since it 
has promise to add to the mechanisms of rituximab (that 
is, through the depletion of CD20+ B cells) the depletion 
of CD19+CD20– cells – that is, PCs and at least some pro/
pre-B cells (CD19+ CD20–CD38+CD10+CD24+IgD–), both 
of which are only limitedly reduced by rituximab 
treatment [17,18]. In contrast to CD20 with hitherto 
largely unknown function, CD19 is known to be con￾tained in the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, regulating 
its activation threshold [58]. In line with this, defects in 
CD19 expression or function elicit autoantibody produc￾tion in mice and also may contribute to human auto￾immunity. Dysregulated CD19 expression has been 
reported in patients with systemic sclerosis, SLE and anti￾neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
vascu litis. To evaluate CD19 as a candidate target of 
therapy, we will discuss aspects of its expression on B 
cells and PCs with particular emphasis on SLE.
Expression and function of CD19
Expression of CD19 and its regulation
CD19 is a 95 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the 
immunoglobulin superfamily encoded by the CD19 gene 
that is expressed under the control of the transcription 
factor BSAP (encoded by PAX5) [59-61], a master regu￾lator of B-cell identity [62,63]. No other transcriptional 
regulator has been identifi ed to bind to the CD19
promoter [59], so CD19 expression probably recapitulates 
the activity of PAX5/BSAP. Consistently, CD19 is 
expressed by B lymphocytes but not by any other cell 
type, except for an unconfi rmed report suggesting CD19 
expression by some follicular dendritic cells [64].
In B cells, expression of CD19 (also referred to as B4 
antigen) starts prior to the expression of CD20 (B1 
antigen) at the late pro-B-cell stage together with that of 
CD10 [65-67]. CD19 expression is maintained through￾out various B-cell diff erentiation and activation stages 
until PC diff erentiation, which is then associated with 
partial loss of CD19 expression (Figure 1).
Regular expression of CD19 appears to require CD81, 
as CD81-defi cient mice show a 50% decrease in CD19 
expression as compared with controls [68] and a patient 
defi cient in CD81 did not express CD19 on the B-cell 
surface despite the expression of intact CD19 alleles [69]. 
BCR defi ciency and mutations in Btk are associated with 
higher and lower CD19 expression by circulating human 
B cells, respectively [70]. Mutations within one allele of 
CD19 itself lead to ~2.4-fold reduced surface expression 
of CD19 [71], while homozygous mutations in the exons 
encoding cytoplasmic residues of CD19 result in the 
generation of a truncated, dysfunctional CD19 molecule 
that is not recognized or is poorly recognized by standard 
anti-CD19 antibodies [72]. In almost all cases, dys￾regulated CD19 expression is associated with abnor￾malities of the immune system, as also suggested by the 
development of autoantibodies in mice carrying a human 
CD19 transgene leading to overexpression of CD19 [73]. 
Consistently, CD19 expression has also been reported to 
be dysregulated in peripheral B cells from autoimmune 
patients.
Overall, CD19 is expressed by almost all developmental 
and activation-dependent B-cell diff erentiation stages, 
except for certain PCs, and functions as an important 
regulator of specifi c B-cell activation by antigen 
(Figure 1). CD19 expression coverage exceeds that shown 
by CD20 expression. Whether all types of B cells will be 
similarly targeted by therapeutic anti-CD19 antibodies 
requires fi rst experiences in patients treated with such 
antibodies.
Functions of CD19
On the surface of B cells, CD19 functions as a co-receptor 
of the BCR and contains two extracellular C2-type Ig-like 
domains. Th rough these domains, CD19 interacts with 
CD21 (CR2, C3d fragment receptor) and CD81, forming 
together with CD225 the BCR complex [74].
Th e intracellular domain of CD19 is involved in intra￾cellular signaling cascades, primarily but not exclusively 
regulating signals downstream of the BCR and CD22 
[58]. Mice either lacking endogenous CD19 expression or 
overexpressing a human CD19 transgene under control 
of the endogenous promoter revealed that CD19 is 
essential for the normal function of the BCR, and in 
particular regulates the threshold for its activation. While 
Mei et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy 2012, 14(Suppl 5):S1

CD19-defi cient mice show impaired B-cell responses, B 
cells from hCD19 transgenic mice were hyperresponsive 
[75,76] and produce autoantibodies. CD19 is thus a 
regulator of BCR signaling threshold and is implicated in 
the control of peripheral tolerance [77]. Human CD19 
defi ciency has no apparent impact on B-cell development 
but relates to the phenotype of CD19–/– mice, in that 
these patients suff er from antibody defi ciency [72]. CD19 
has also been suggested to have a role in regulating cell 
proliferation, apparently independent of B-cell identity. 
CD19 transfection of multiple myeloma but also other 
cell lines led to reduced culture growth and tumor 
formation when injected in mice. Th is eff ect depended 
on the cytoplasmic part of CD19 [78]. Overall, the 
currently available data suggest that CD19 plays critical 
roles in B-cell and PC diff erentiation as well as in cell 
turnover.
CD19 expression by B cells in autoimmunity
Evaluation of anti-CD19 therapy as a therapeutic option 
requires careful consideration of CD19 expression levels 
by B cells from patients with autoimmune diseases.
CD19 expression levels of B-cell subsets in the blood
In the blood of patients with lupus, ANCA-associated 
vasculitis and systemic sclerosis, but also in healthy 
individuals, CD27+ (memory) B cells appear to express 
higher levels of CD19 than CD27– (naïve) B cells [79-81], 
perhaps corresponding to the distinct activation threshold 
of memory versus naïve B cells in response to antigen. 
Moreover, circulating CD27high-expressing plasmablasts 
usually but not always show downregulated, however 
clearly detectable, expression of CD19 in autoimmune 
patients and healthy individuals [80-84]. Th e cell surface 
density of CD19 is lower than that of CD20 in normal B 
cells [85]. Th is diff erence probably has limited impli cations 
for the functionality and biological effi cacy of anti-CD19 
versus anti-CD20 treatments, because specifi c modifi ca￾tions of the antibodies (engineering) prefer en tially defi ne 
target cell binding and clearing properties [86,87].
Disturbed expression of CD19 in SLE and other 
autoimmune diseases
In autoimmune patients, both reduced and enhanced 
CD19 expression by peripheral blood B cells has been 
described compared with healthy controls. Patients with 
systemic sclerosis displayed a ~20% increase of CD19 
expression on peripheral blood B cells irrespective of 
whether naïve or memory B cells were analyzed [73,81]. 
CD19 expression levels correlated with serum IgG and 
IgM concentrations but not with serum anti-nuclear 
antibody in these patients [73].
Figure 1. Expression of CD19 and CD20 during human B-cell development. B cells emerge from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and acquire 
maturity in the bone marrow (BM). During this process, CD19 expression starts at the stage of late pro-B cells and precedes that of CD20, starting 
in immature B cells. CD19 and CD20 expression is maintained during B-cell diff erentiation and activation in the periphery, while activation and 
diff erentiation into memory B cells may fi ne-tune expression levels. During activation of B cells in lymphoid organs – such as the spleen and 
tonsil, resulting in their diff erentiation into plasmablasts and fi nally plasma cells – CD20 expression is downregulated and subsequently lost. At 
the same time, CD19 expression is partially downregulated but not extinguished. Being released into circulation, only few plasmablasts express 
low amounts of CD20, while most have lost CD20 expression but express CD19. After successful immigration into deposits in the BM or the lamina 
propria (LP), all plasma cells lack CD20, while CD19 expression is maintained by one subset of tissue-resident plasma cells, while another subset 
acquires a CD19–
/CD20–
 phenotype. Other surface molecules such as CD27, CD38 and CD138 do not qualify as therapeutic targets for global B-cell 
depletion approaches, as these are not continuously expressed throughout B-cell diff erentiation and their expression is shared with, for example, T 
lymphocytes and endothelial cells.

In our analyses, average CD19 expression levels of 
memory and naive B cells from patients with SLE were 
comparable with those of healthy controls based on mean 
fl uorescence intensities, whereas plasmablasts showed a 
trend towards lower CD19 levels (Figure  2). However, 
CD19 levels detected on patients’ memory cells and also 
naive B cells showed higher variability than those of 
healthy controls. Stratifi cation of the patient cohort 
according to high and low disease activity (Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)) 
or ascending expression levels of CD19 suggested an 
inverse correlation of CD19 expression levels with 
disease activity. Moreover, CD19 levels expressed by 
plasmablasts, memory cells and naive B cells strongly 
correlated with each other (P <0.0001). Overall, CD19 
expression by plasmablasts was signifi cantly lower as 
compared with that of memory cells and naive B cells in 
both SLE patients and controls. Th is suggests that CD19 
expression levels in B cells are regulated via diff eren￾tiation-independent mechanisms as well as diff erentia￾tion-dependent mechanisms. Other studies documented 
about 20% reduced CD19 expression levels by naïve and 
memory B cells from SLE patients [73,81]. In this regard, 
our SLE cohort appears to comprise patients with either 
markedly higher or lower CD19 expression, while there 
were only few patients within the limited range of CD19 
expression values of healthy individuals. Th ese data 
reproduce both upregulation and downregulation of 
CD19 by blood B cells from autoimmune patients, which 
may correspond to the previous observations of CD19high
B cells (as discussed below) or reduced CD19 expression 
[81].
Overall, the reduction of CD19 expression by SLE B 
cells in at least some patients appears to be a reproducible 
phenomenon, independent of disease activity, the 
presence of anti-nuclear antibodies or use of the diff erent 
anti-CD19 antibodies applied to expression analyses 
[79,80]. Interestingly, the diff erence of CD19 expression 
by B cells between healthy controls and SLE patients has 
not been found on a transcriptional level and was rever￾sible after a 2-day, nonstimulating in vitro culture [80].
Th ese data representing an apparent bidirectional dys￾regulation of CD19 expression by B cells from auto￾immune patients are consistent with the fi ne-tuning of 
CD19 expression in vivo, which however may not be 
specifi cally linked to autoimmunity in general.
CD19high B cells in SLE patients
Additional studies have characterized a population of 
CD19high-expressing B cells in patients with SLE and 
ANCA-associated vasculitis, representing up to 10% of 
the B cells in most patients and up to 30% in individual 
cases [79,88,89]. CD19high B cells showed markedly higher 
CD19 expression than B cells from healthy controls, 
while the remaining CD19low B cells recapitulated the 
reduced CD19 expression [79] as also documented by 
other studies [73,80,81]. Detailed fl ow cytometric analy￾ses of CD19high B cells revealed increased forward-scatter 
signals compared with CD19low B cells. CD19high B cells 
mainly expressed CD27, and to a lesser degree IgD, and 
displayed increased expression of CD86, MHC II and 
CD95 [79,89] consistent with recent activation of this 
putative memory B-cell subset in vivo. Consistently, 
CD19high B cells displayed enhanced phosphorylation of 
signaling molecules downstream of the BCR complex, 
such as Syk and ERK, which distinguished them from 
CD19low B cells [88] and could be generated in vitro from 
both BCR/CpG-activated naive or memory B cells [90].
In SLE and other autoimmune and immune-defi cient 
patients, CD19high B cells are characterized by low surface 
CD21 expression [70,73,79,81,89]. Th ese cells therefore 
resemble the phenotype of B cells that were reported as 
‘exhausted tissue-like memory B cells’ in patients with 
HIV [91] or common variable immunodefi ciency [92]. In 
the latter, CD19high B cells were not associated with auto￾immune phenomena but with splenomegaly and 
cytopenia [92]. Th e presence of CD19high/CD21low B cells 
is hence not unique for patients with SLE and probably 
corresponds to distinct functional stages of activated B 
cells. In support of this hypothesis, such CD19high B cells 
express reduced levels of CD62L (l-selectin), CXCR4 and 
CXCR5 [70,89,91], which may exclude these cells from 
regular recirculation and germinal center participation, 
while enhanced expression of functional CXCR3 [88] 
might allow for their migration to sites of infl ammation 
in vivo.
Th e presence of CD19high B cells did not correlate with 
disease activity in SLE or ANCA-associated vasculitis 
[79,89], but did correlate with neurological and renal 
disease manifestations [79,88], shorter clinical benefi t 
from rituximab treatment [88] as well as anti-Sm but not 
anti-nuclear antibody or anti-Ro/La titers [79]. Indeed, 
CD19high B cells from anti-Sm-positive SLE patients 
yielded considerable amounts of Sm-specifi c antibody￾secreting cells 6 days after in vitro activation culture, in 
contrast to CD19low B cells [88], suggesting that this 
subset might contain a substantial part of autoreactive B 
cells.
In summary, abnormalities in CD19 expression appear 
to be related to the activation status of B cells rather than 
specifi cally linked to autoimmunity (Table  3). Th e com￾bined data of CD19 expression in conjunction with 
changes of CD21, CD81, BCR and Btk suggest that CD19 
expression is fi ne-tuned by BCR-mediated activation 
signals. Given the enhanced CD19 expression by some B 
cells under the condition of autoimmunity, these cells 
may constitute a key target. However, given that blood 
lymphocytes represent approximately 2% of total body

lymphocytes [93,94], whether the data above are also 
representative for tissue-resident B cells in the spleen, 
lymph nodes, BM, gut-associated lymphoid tissues and 
infl amed sites remains open. Apparently all B-cell stages 
in the human blood and probably in the relevant tissues 
express CD19 and presumably could be targeted by an 
anti-CD19 antibody.
CD19 expression by plasma cells
Importantly, a substantial fraction of antibody-secreting 
PCs express CD19 in contrast to CD20, which is down￾regulated during plasmablast diff erentiation in associa￾tion with their relocation from secondary lymphoid 
tissue to PC depots in the BM or lamina propria. Splenic 
and tonsillar plasmablasts appear as CD19+CD20+/intermediate￾expressing cells [95-97], while plasmablasts in the blood 
express low or no CD20 and diminished CD19 levels 
[80,81,83,84,96,98]. One must emphasize that PCs in the 
BM consist of both CD20–CD19+ and CD20–CD19– PC 
subsets in man [96,99] and in the mouse [100]. Th e 
bimodal distribution of CD19 expression among PCs in 
the BM of both healthy and autoimmune individuals 
(Figure  3) has important implications since CD19-
directed therapies could therefore target some, but not 
all, PCs.
Both PC diff erentiation and downregulation of CD19 
are tightly interrelated with the loss of PAX5/BSAP 
expression [101,102], and consequently BSAP binding 
sites in the CD19 promoter are not occupied in PCs [59]. 
While many PC lines and multiple myeloma cells lack 
CD19 expression, fractions of normal mature PCs in the 
human BM but also in the mucosal lamina propria 
express CD19 [96,99,103-105], including IgG-secreting 
cells in man [98] and Blimp-1+ PC in the mouse [100].
Little is known about the nature of underlying immune 
reactions and/or the relationship between CD19+ and 
CD19– PC in the BM or lamina propria, which makes it 
challenging to estimate the potential eff ects of CD19-
directed therapy on humoral (auto)immunity. In the 
mouse, the gradual loss of CD19 on PCs seems to be 
associated with advanced maturity; that is, higher 
expression of Blimp-1, lower expression of HLA-DR and 
B220, and eventually a longer lifespan [100]. Neither 
CD19+ nor CD19– PCs from human BM expressed PAX5
mRNA, but they did express IRF4, PRDM1 and CD138 at 
comparable levels (n ≥4; HE Mei and T Dörner, un pub￾lished data). Th is suggests additional factors regulating 
the expression of CD19 on PCs beyond transcriptional 
control by PAX5/BSAP.
Th ese data are consistent with the assumption that 
anti-CD19 therapy would probably target signifi cant 
fractions of PCs while not enhancing all PCs. More 
information is therefore required on the dynamics of and 
the relationship between CD19+ and CD19– PCs in order 
to estimate the impact of anti-CD19 treatment.
Plasmablasts and certain plasma cells can be targeted by 
anti-CD19
CD19+ cells comprise virtually all antibody-secreting 
cells in the peripheral blood in both healthy individuals 
and patients with SLE as well as other autoimmune 
diseases [25,83,106]. Th ese comprise (at least) two major 
fractions: fi rst, recently generated antibody-secreting 
cells that undergo cell division, are capable of in vitro
migration towards gradients of CXCL12 [25], express 
high levels of HLA-DR and contain antigen-specifi c cells 
that pass the peripheral blood 1 week after a tetanus 
booster vaccination [83]. We termed these cells plasma￾blasts [7,25,36,83], whereas the remaining antibody￾secret ing cells were defi ned as PCs that were unable to 
proliferate and migrate in vitro [25], lack surface 
expression of the adhesion molecules β7
-integrin and 
CD62L (l-selectin), express low levels of HLA-DR and do 
not contain antigen-specifi c cells after vaccination 
[25,83]. When analyzed 1 week after tetanus vaccination, 
circulating HLA-DRlow PCs phenotypically, functionally 
and transcriptionally showed a high degree of similarity 
with BM PCs [7,25], and probably refl ect outcompeted 
mature BM PCs [83]. Both subsets can be detected by 
fl ow cytometry after gating on CD19+ cells combined 
with an enlarged lymphocyte gate [25,82-84].
CD19 expression by plasmablasts in autoimmune 
diseases has rarely been analyzed. Sato and colleagues 
did not detect statistically signifi cant diff erences in the 
CD19 signals by fl ow cytometry when comparing 
plasmablasts (together with PCs using the CD27high
criterion for detection) among healthy individuals and 
patients with SLE or systemic sclerosis [81] – while 
another study showed lower CD19 expression by SLE 
CD27high plasmablasts as compared with those from 
healthy controls [80], which is consistent with our data 
(Figure 2). As illustrated in a representative SLE patient, 
approximately 80% of the peripheral blood CD138+
plasmablasts/PCs express CD19 [84], indicating that a 
minority of circulating PCs lacks expression of this 
marker.

Frequencies and numbers of CD19-expressing plasma￾blasts/PCs are drastically increased in patients with SLE 
[54,82,84,107] and refl ect up to 50% of all circulating 
CD19+ B cells [84] while containing dsDNA-specifi c cells 
[54]. Th e cell frequency and number correlated with 
disease activity and autoantibody production [82,84,106], 
and this correlation was even more pronounced when 
HLA-DRhigh plasmablasts were analyzed separately [54]. 
Th e presence of these plasmablasts therefore refl ects 
acute, presumably pathogenic B-cell activation in patients 
with SLE. Elevation of peripheral blood plasmablast 
levels has also been recently demonstrated for Takayasu’s 
arteriitis patients [108], but not in patients with primary 
Sjögren’s syndrome [109], autoimmune thrombo cyto￾penia [110], systemic sclerosis [81] and RA [19]. Further 
analyses focusing on CD19+ B cells in the BM demon￾strated an imbalance of HLA-DRhigh plasmablasts versus 
HLA-DRlow PC subsets – that is, relative expansion of 
plasmablasts in SLE patients’ BM – indicating that not 
only the periphery but also the major deposit sites of PC 
are disturbed in SLE [54].
Th e prominent presence of presumably pathogenic 
plasmablasts in SLE patients’ blood and BM [3] provide a 
further rationale for anti-CD19 therapy since 
CD19+CD20–/low plasmablasts are refractory to B-cell 
depletion with rituximab in RA, SLE and other auto￾immune syndromes [19,21,111-114]. In this context, we 
found that rituximab-resistant plasmablasts carry a 
mucosal phenotype in patients with RA and show multiple 
traits of their recent generation, such as cell proliferation 
and spontaneous in vitro migration. Th is fi nding points 
towards a self-suffi cient, rituximab-resistant mucosal 
B-cell subset in man [19] that is chronically activated 
and gives rise to plasmablasts in circulation. In SLE 
patients, higher levels of plasmablasts after B-cell 
depletion have been reported to be associated with 
poorer clinical response [112]. Anti-CD19 therapy 
might constitute a possibility to overcome this limita￾tion of rituximab by directly targeting these plasma￾blasts and certain CD19+ PCs. Th ere is thus a possibility 
that especially autoantibody-positive patients could 
benefi t from anti-CD19 therapy, but this needs to be 
demonstrated.
Overall, a better understanding of the homeostasis and 
diff erentiation of diff erent mature PC subsets in healthy 
subjects and autoimmune patients not only related to the 
expression of CD19 but also to their distribution and 
characteristics in certain organs and organ systems is 
required to fully explore the potential benefi ts and 
potential side eff ects of, and suitable molecular targets 
for PC-directed therapies.
Anti-CD19 treatment approaches and eff ects on 
antibody production
Autoreactive clones of long-lived PCs have been con￾sidered an obstacle for existing therapies in autoimmunity 
[3], while anti-CD19 therapies have been initially developed 
to delete malignant B-cell clones using both native and 
modifi ed anti-CD19 antibodies with or without conju￾gated toxins as well as bispecifi c antibodies targeting, for 
example, CD19 and CD3 or transgenic T cells carrying a 
T-cell receptor recognizing CD19. Although approaches 
in oncology diff er in their rationales compared with 
autoimmunity, the existing data for anti-CD19 antibodies

 cells. Plasma cells (PCs) were identifi ed based on light scatter properties and high expression of CD38. CD38high PCs showed co-expression of

in treating malignant diseases represent a valuable 
mechanism of action and a safety data pool.
Native naked and conjugated anti-CD19 antibodies
Initial studies in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients 
[115,116] using CLB-CD19 with or without IL-2 demon￾strated binding of anti-CD19 antibody to B cells in vivo
and led to partial reduction of blood B cells, but did not 
consistently change total antibody levels during treat￾ment (up to 12 weeks) and in the follow-up period.
Various anti-CD19 immunotoxins are under develop￾ment for malignant diseases – for example, bound to 
auristatin [117], saporin [118] or ricin [119] – but have 
not so far entered studies in autoimmunity.
In a mouse model of anti-CD19 therapy using hCD19 
transgenic mice [120] and anti-human CD19 antibodies 
(HB12a, HB12b and FMC63), depletion of >90% of B cells 
in the BM, blood, spleen and lymph nodes was observed, 
while peritoneal cavity B cells were reduced by only two￾thirds. Notably, pro-B cells in the BM were not depleted 
in this system. Blood B cells remained depleted for about 
12  weeks and only partially repopulated until 30 weeks 
after treatment. In this model, levels of total serum 
antibody concentrations were reduced by 95% for IgM, 
by 10 to 20% for IgG and by about 40% for IgA compared 
with baseline values. Specifi c IgM and IgG1
 responses to 
T-independent antigens and primary and secondary
responses to T-dependent antigens were virtually abro￾gated in mice treated with anti-CD19. Reduction of 
specifi c serum IgM and IgG1
 concentrations also 
occurred in previously immunized mice treated with 
anti-CD19 [120], most probably refl ecting that antibody￾secreting cells were successfully targeted in this model.
Autoantibody production analyzed in this mouse 
model was critically dependent on the overexpression of 
CD19 [121,122], and CD19 expression was reduced over 
at least 10 weeks after anti-CD19 therapy. While animals 
treated with control antibody developed increasing levels 
of anti-dsDNA, anti-ssDNA and anti-histone IgM and 
IgG antibodies, anti-CD19-treated mice showed reduc￾tions of IgM autoantibodies within 2 weeks. IgG auto￾antibodies were also reduced in a delayed manner at the 
latest by week 10 after treatment [120]. Th ese Ig-class￾specifi c responses of serum antibody levels to anti-CD19 
treatment indicate diff erential dynamics of IgM+ and 
IgG+ PC subsets and indicate that some but perhaps not 
all autoreactive PCs express CD19 in this model. However, 
additional studies are required in control mice and in 
models of SLE that are independent of genetic modifi -
cation of CD19 expression.
Engineered anti-CD19 antibodies
Modifi cations of the amino acid sequence and the glyco￾sylation of native anti-CD19 antibodies [86,87], as well as 
engineering of bispecifi c antibodies co-targeting other 
antigens (for example, CD3 [123]) to enhance target cell 
binding clearing properties, have generated interest in 
anti-CD19 immunotherapy.
In this context, the bispecifi c CD19×CD3 antibody 
(Blinatumomab, MT103, MEDI-538, bispecifi c T-cell 
engager (BiTE)) that has been designed to recruit and 
activate T cells in the vicinity of CD19+ tumor cells in 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients resulted in substantial 
and effi cacious depletion of blood B cells (residual 
numbers <10 cells/μl) for up to 2 months and obviously 
cleared malignant B cells in the BM, spleen and liver. 
More than 85% of the study participants showed no 
signifi cant decline of serum Ig levels, refl ecting that most 
patients retained an intact PC compartment during 
therapy.
Th e application of XmAb5574 (MOR208) in Cyno mol￾gus monkeys did not reduce serum IgG, IgA and IgM 
levels over a 3-month period [124], indicating that the PC 
compartment remained intact either due to resistance of 
PCs or incomplete depletion of B cells in this model. 
Indeed, only 80 to 90% of CD20+ B cells in peripheral 
blood and 40 to 60% within the BM, spleen and lymph 
nodes were depleted 1 month after anti-CD19 treatment 
[124]. A clinical phase I trial with XmAb5574 in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia patients is currently ongoing (Trial 
#NCT01161511). A further anti-CD19 antibody is 
MEDI-551, which is able to deplete B cells in suspensions 
of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 
blood and splenic B cells in hCD19/hCD20 double 
transgenic mice [86]. Data that might allow an evaluation 
of targeting PC in humans by this antibody are not yet 
available, but clinical trials have been initiated. Th e anti￾CD19 antibody MDX-1342 was under investigation in 
RA patients in combination with methotrexate [125] but 
was discontinued in April 2010. Further anti-CD19 
approaches such as derivates of the anti-human CD19 
clone HD37 are being developed [126].
Multiple anti-CD19 antibodies are being and have been 
developed for therapeutic use, so far with very in￾consistent experiences in preclinical models or pilot trials 
with regard to both the effi cacy and duration of B-cell 
and PC depletion.
Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells
A diff erent way of CD19 targeting employs transplants of 
autologous T lymphocytes that are isolated from the 
patients’ blood, stimulated in vitro with, for example, 
anti-CD3 and IL-2, and transduced with a vector con￾ferring expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
that is directed against CD19. Upon incubation with 
CD19+ cells, CAR-bearing T cells produce IFNγ and IL-2 
[127,128] and lead to sustained depletion of B cells, 
including tumor cells in human blood (at least for 
Mei et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy 2012, 14(Suppl 5):S1

40  weeks) and in BM (at least for 36  weeks) [127]. 
Notably, serum Ig levels gradually dropped during this 
therapy with reductions of approximately 40 to 50% for 
IgG within 14  weeks, 85% (within 14  weeks) and 75% 
(until week  36) for IgA and IgM, respectively. In a 
subsequent study of eight non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
patients, four individuals experienced profound B-cell 
depletion with hypogammaglobulinemia requiring Ig 
substitution [129] – similar to that described for treat￾ment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients using 
CD19 CAR-expressing T cells [130]. Depletion failed in 
the other four patients, as has also been reported by an 
independent study [131], and was probably due to pro￾per ties of the malignant B cells or result from variations 
of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell generation.
Th e available data on B-cell and PC targeting by anti￾CD19-directed approaches in oncologic diseases do not 
allow fi rm conclusions as to what extent PC depletion 
occurs in autoimmunity and may diff er between certain 
agents and techniques. Ongoing clinical studies will 
provide more detailed information on the effi cacy and 
especially safety of anti-CD19 approaches, which will 
also permit a unique opportunity to compare those with 
anti-CD20 experiences and at the same time better defi ne 
potential treatment options for autoimmunity.
Potential risks and benefi ts of anti-CD19 therapy in 
autoimmunity
Humoral immunity and the potential risks for infections
Apparently, targeting both B cells and PCs raises safety 
concerns with regard to suffi cient control of environ￾mental pathogens and infections by protective Ig 
generated as a fi rst-line defense as well as during B-cell 
memory responses. CD19 targeting can be assumed to 
enlarge the window of cell depletion compared with anti￾CD20 therapy, with an additional impact on pro-B cells 
and PCs. As the maintenance of protective and auto￾reactive antibody titers and the contributions of diff erent 
subsets of CD19+ versus CD19– PCs and CD19+ plasma￾blasts are incompletely understood, one may only 
speculate about the impact of anti-CD19 on immune 
protection. Successful targeting of CD19+ PCs in patients 
with SLE is expected to at least substantially reduce 
autoantibody titers produced by plasmablasts and certain 
PCs. However, severe reductions of Ig levels can be 
managed by intravenous Ig infusions [129]. We believe 
one cannot exclude the possibility that patients might 
experience loss of or impairment of suffi cient antibody 
production under anti-CD19 therapy, as observed in 
patients with common variable immunodefi ciency who 
often show reduced numbers of PCs in the BM [132] and 
usually fail to mount suffi cient vaccination responses 
[133]. Th e failure to suffi ciently respond to vaccinations 
of most patients treated with anti-CD20 will probably 
also aff ect patients treated with anti-CD19 therapy. 
During rituximab treatment, both primary and secondary 
serological antibody responses are substantially impaired 
[134-138], while pre-existing antibody titers were largely 
maintained. Th e estimated time period of B-cell absence 
after anti-CD19-mediated B-cell depletion is currently 
unknown, while B-cell depletion with rituximab lasts 
usually 6 months or longer. Given the broader coverage 
of anti-CD19 that includes pro-B cells, it is possible that 
peripheral B-cell repopulation after anti-CD19 therapy 
diff ers from that after anti-CD20 therapy.
A situation of antibody defi ciency has been described 
in SLE patients after ASCT with prior immunoablation 
using high-dose cyclophosphamide and rabbit anti￾thymocyte globulin, which often leads to improvement of 
the disease, perhaps remission, but also caused loss of 
protective serum antibody titers directed to both protein 
and viral antigens (anti-tetanus, anti-measles, anti-diph￾theria, anti-rubella) [5]. Th e risk of opportunistic infec￾tions therefore requires careful monitoring and poten￾tially might represent a limitation. Given that diminishing 
autoimmune PCs provides substantial benefi t for the 
patients, including long-term remission, the possibility of 
intravenous Ig substitution may allow balancing the risk 
of hypoimmunoglobulinemia and infections.
Experiences with this therapy in tumor patients 
[123,127,129,131] might in part be instructive for 
potential risks of anti-CD19 therapy in autoimmunity but 
can only be extrapolated with caution because of the 
diff erent underlying disease and pre-existing and co￾medications. Further potential side eff ects of anti-CD19 
therapy probably overlap with various adverse events 
reported after B-cell depletion with rituximab, such as 
the occurrence of infections [139,140], suppression of 
specifi c B-cell responses [134-136] and risk to develop 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [141]. Th ese 
aspects are of particular importance since B-cell deple￾tion by anti-CD19 strategies appears to be broad and 
long-lasting [129] while B cells and antibody is required 
to suppress John Cunningham virus (see [141]). Overall, 
the safety profi le of anti-CD19 therapy in autoimmunity 
will be of central importance but requires further data.
CD19 ligation as an additional mechanism beyond 
depletion
Animal model data for anti-CD19 therapy documented 
effi cient reductions but sometimes not complete deple￾tion of B cells [120,124]. In such cases, B cells labeled by 
anti-CD19 would remain in vivo, with as yet unclear 
consequences for the modulation of BCR signaling [75, 
77,121]. In vitro, anti-CD19 (HD37) lowers the threshold 
for anti-BCR (IgM)-induced human B-cell activation 
under certain conditions [142], which could confer 
enhanced B-cell activation and even exacerbation of 
Mei et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy 2012, 14(Suppl 5):S1

autoimmunity, while other reports using diff erent 
protocols reported an inhibition of BCR signaling by 
anti-CD19 antibody. Th e above notions remain a theo￾retical possibility since overactivation of B cells during 
anti-CD19 treatment has not so far been reported.
Regulatory B cells
B-cell depletion also aff ects B cells with immuno￾suppressive potential, which might explain some rare 
cases of autoimmunity that were reported during 
rituximab therapy [143-146]. In this regard, several 
studies in mice indicate an important role of B cells 
producing IL-10 in controlling autoimmunity [147]. In 
vitro generated IL-10-producing B cells express CD19 
[148,149] and were therefore subject to CD19-directed 
depletion. Th e phenotype and the importance of human
bona fi de IL-10-secreting B cells in vivo remains un￾known, however, and there is no clear evidence for im￾paired control of immune responses after either anti￾CD19 or anti-CD20 therapy in humans.
Th e estimated immunological side eff ects of envisaged 
B-cell depletion using CD19-directed approaches mostly 
resemble the experiences from rituximab treatment. 
While additional putative depletion of pro-B cells leading 
to prolonged peripheral reconstitution and reductions of 
major PC subsets might lead to an enhanced risk for 
infections, CD19 therapy has the promise to improve 
effi cacy compared with the more restricted B-cell 
targeting by anti-CD20 antibodies.
