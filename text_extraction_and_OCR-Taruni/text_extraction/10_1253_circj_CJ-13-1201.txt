RVF soon after the LVAD implantation shortens survival even 
after successful heart transplantation in recipients bridged from 
LVAD.17
Most studies have used a combination of management crite￾ria to define postoperative RVF [ie, inotropes treatment for >2 
weeks and/or inhalation of nitric monoxide for >48h, or me￾chanical support for RV including extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation or RV assist device (RVAD)].2,5,8,10–14,18 On the 
basis of this definition, many investigators including us have 
proposed preoperative risk factors for RVF [eg, lower RV stroke 
work index (RVSWI) or higher ratio of central venous pressure 
to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (CVP/PCWP)].5,14,18
Most of these parameters are believed to represent preoperative 
latent RVF, which become clinically evident soon after the im￾ecently, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy 
for patients with stage D heart failure (HF) has been 
proven to improve survival over optimal medical ther￾apy.1 The continuous flow (CF) LVAD has replaced the pulsa￾tile flow (PF) LVAD because it is associated with better survival, 
higher quality of life, and less device-related complications.2,3
However, the incidence of right ventricular failure (RVF) after 
LVAD implantation has been reported to be between 20% and 
50%,4–13 and remains unchanged despite an improved immedi￾ate postoperative survival with newly developed CF LVADs.4
RVF after LVAD implantation often results in poor outcome, 
such as operative mortality, postoperative morbidity, mortality, 
more frequent renal failure and bleeding, longer intensive care 
unit and hospital length of stay.5,6,14–16 The development of

Late-Onset Right Ventricular Failure in Patients With 
Preoperative Small Left Ventricle After Implantation of 
Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device

Background: The continuous flow (CF) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has replaced the pulsatile flow (PF) LVAD 
because of its advantages of better patient survival and higher quality of life. However, “late-onset right ventricular 
failure (RVF)” after CF LVAD implantation has emerged as an increasing concern, but little is known about the mech￾anism.
Methods and Results: We retrospectively analyzed the 3-month hemodynamic and echocardiographic data from 
38 consecutive patients who had received CF LVADs, and from 22 patients who had received PF LVADs. Late-onset 
RVF was defined as persistent right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) <4.0g/m2 at any rotation speed and after 
saline infusion test at 5 weeks after implantation of CF LVAD. Patients with late-onset RVF had significantly impaired 
exercise tolerance indicated by shorter 6-min walking distance and lower peak V˙ O2, and worsened tricuspid regurgi￾tation, together with enlargement of the RV under CF LVAD treatment (all P<0.05). Univariable analyses demonstrated 
that preoperative smaller LV diastolic diameter (LVDd) was the risk factor for late-onset RVF with a cutoff value of 64mm 
calculated by ROC analysis (area under curve, 0.925). In contrast, there was no correlation between preoperative 
LVDd and postoperative RVSWI in the PF LVAD group, though their preoperative background was worse than that 
of the CF group.
Conclusions: In the setting of preoperative small LVDd, CF LVAD may cause late-onset RVF by leftward shift of 
the interventricular septum.  (Circ J 2014; 78: 625–633)

patient’s demographics, and the laboratory, hemodynamic, and 
echocardiographic data obtained within <24h before implan￾tation of the LVAD. After LVAD implantation, the rotation 
speed was adjusted as low as possible by monitoring the patient’s 
clinical status and routine transthoracic echocardiography. A 
hemodynamic study was executed in all CF patients at 5 weeks 
after the surgery, and at least 3 rotation speeds (low, medium, 
and high) were tested with the hemodynamic measurements. 
Infusion of 10ml/kg of 0.9% NaCl solution over 15min was 
performed at medium rotation speed unless the patient’s mean 
right atrial pressure (mRAP) was >15mmHg. Hemodynamic 
parameters were monitored through the central vein during the 
15-min saline infusion. “Suck down” phenomenon was care￾fully surveyed by monitoring the size of the LV cavity, the dis￾tance between the LV wall and LVAD inflow cannula, sudden 
decrease in cardiac output, and ventricular ectopy. Laboratory 
and echocardiographic data were obtained and the 6-min walk￾ing distance was measured together with cardiopulmonary ex￾ercise testing in all the CF LVAD patients at 3 months after the 
operation. 
In the PF LVAD group, the hemodynamic study and echocar￾diography were executed before (<1 week before the surgery) 
and after the surgery (144.3±123.2 days after the surgery). Lab￾oratory data were obtained within <24h before implantation of 
LVAD.
Valvular regurgitation was classified into 4 grades: 0, none; 
1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. To determine the frequency of 
the native aortic valve opening, we counted the number of aor￾tic valve openings per native heart rate over at least 1min. All 
patients were classified based on the interagency registry for 
mechanically assisted circulatory support (INTERMACS). Sev￾eral scoring systems to predict early RVF or prognosis after 
implantation of LVAD were calculated preoperatively: RVF 
risk score (RVFRS),6 todai right ventricular failure score (TRV 
score),14 and todai ventricular assist device score (TVAD 
score).21 RVFRS was calculated from several indexes, includ￾ing usage of vasopressor, serum aspartate aminotransferase 
>80IU/L, serum total bilirubin >2.0mg/dl, and serum creatinine 
>2.3mg/dl, to predict early RVF after LVAD implantation. The 
TRV score consisted of CVP/PCWP >0.5, body surface area 
<1.40m2, use of CHDF, plasma BNP >1,200pg/ml, and left 
ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd) <62mm. Patients with 
TRV score >20 points had a higher probability of requiring peri￾operative mechanical RV support with severe early RVF. The 
TVAD score consisting of serum albumin <3.2mg/dl, serum 
total bilirubin >4.8mg/dl, CVP >11mmHg, and LVDd <55mm 
was calculated to predict 1-year mortality after LVAD implan￾tation. 
plantation of LVAD. We call that type of RVF as “early RVF” 
(Table 1). 
Recently, several investigators, including us, have reported 
late-onset and progressive RVF after CF LVAD implantation in 
spite of lacking preoperative risk factors for the above-described 
postoperative “early RVF.”13,19 “Late-onset RVF” does not fol￾low the conventional definition of early RVF but emerges sev￾eral weeks after LVAD implantation.13,19 A large part of early 
RVF eventually resolves in a few weeks to a month even though 
intensive care is sometimes necessary, but late-onset RVF is 
often refractory to medical therapy or adjustment of rotation 
speed. Late-onset RVF is persistent and therefore a great con￾cern, especially in Japan, because of the long waiting periods 
on VAD resulting from the extreme shortage of donor hearts.20
However, the mechanism of late-onset RVF remains to be 
elucidated. Therefore, we define it here as persistent RVSWI 
<4.0g/m2 at any rotation speed or saline infusion at 5 weeks 
after the implantation of a CF LVAD (Table 1), and analyzed 
its preoperative risk factors. 
Methods
Patient Population
We retrospectively examined 38 consecutive patients with stage 
D HF who had been followed at the University of Tokyo 
Hospital for at least 3 months after implantation of a CF LVAD 
(EVAHEART, 20; DuraHeart, 10; HeartMate II, 8) between 
May 2011 and Oct 2013. A hemodynamic study of 22 patients 
who had received extracorporeal PF LVAD was also execut￾ed. In the PF LVAD group, patients who developed early RVF, 
which was defined as intravenous inotropic treatment for >2 
weeks and/or inhalation of nitric monoxide for >48h, or me￾chanical support for RV including extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation or RVAD, were excluded from this study. 
Intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) was executed if neces￾sary on the basis of the physicians’ decision prior to LVAD 
insertion. Concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty (TAP) was per￾formed when preoperative tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was 
graded as moderate to severe. All patients were listed for heart 
transplantation before LVAD implantation. 
Written informed consent was given before LVAD implan￾tation by the patients and/or their family members in all cases. 
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo [appli￾cation number 779 (1)].
Variables Evaluated

Small LV and RVF After CF LVAD Implantation 629
patients (36.8%) with late-onset RVF in all 3 devices at a 
similar rate [EVAHEART, 7 (35.0%); DuraHeart, 4 (40.0%); 
HeartMate II, 3 (37.5%)]. There were no statistical differences 
in daily rotation speed between both groups (Table 3). Higher 
mRAP and lower cardiac index (CI) were observed at baseline 
hemodynamic measurement in late-onset RVF group together 
with lower RVSWI compared with non-RVF group. 
In non-RVF group who always had RVSWI >4.0g/m2, the 
CI increased as rotation speed increased (Table S1). After sa￾line infusion, CI and RVSWI were both increased in the non￾RVF group. In patients in the RVF group who had persistently 
low RVSWI, CI did not increase with incremental rotation speed 
or saline infusion. As shown in Figure, RVSWI remained lower 
at any mRAP level obtained by incremental rotation speed or 
saline infusion in patients with late-onset RVF (n=14), where￾as RVSWI increased significantly with higher mRAP in pa￾tients without late-onset RVF (n=24). 
We did not observe collapse of the LV cavity, close contact of 
the LVAD inflow cannula to LV wall, drastic decrease in car￾diac output, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia at any rotation speed, 
and therefore we considered that the “suck down” phenomenon 
did not occur in any case. 
Clinical Features of Late-Onset RVF After CF LVAD 
Implantation: Postoperative Parameters (Table 3)
At 3 months after CF LVAD implantation, the mean 6-min 
walking distance was shorter, and peak V˙ O2 was lower com￾pared with patients without RVF. More patients with RVF suf￾fered pulmonary effusion or leg edema, and had higher levels 
of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide than those without RVF 
after 3 months. There were no statistical differences in the rate 
of opening of the native aortic valve. TR worsened in many of 
the patients with late-onset RVF, together with a more dilated 
tricuspid valve diameter and smaller LVDd. 
Univariable Analyses of Preoperative Parameters for Late￾Onset RVF After Implantation of CF LVADs: Preoperative 
Parameters (Table 4)
Univariable analyses showed that preoperative LVDd (P=0.005, 
odds ratio (OR) 0.817), LVDd/body surface area (P=0.006, 
OR 0.723), and LV mass index (LVMI) (P=0.010, OR 0.945) 
cardiographic and hemodynamic parameters at medium or high 
rotation speed were compared with those at low rotation speed 
using Dunnett’s post hoc test when repeated measure analysis 
of variance approved overall significance. Parameters obtained 
after saline infusion were compared by paired t-test with those 
at medium rotation speed. Unless otherwise specified, all data 
are expressed as mean±standard deviation. All hypothetical 
tests reported are 2-tailed, and P<0.05 was significant.
Results
Baseline Characteristics Before Implantation of LVADs 
(Table 2)
None of the 38 consecutive patients who underwent implanta￾tion of a CF LVAD, and a hemodynamic study at 5 weeks after 
the surgery were assigned to INTERMACS profile 1 preopera￾tively; 10 patients (26.3%) received IABP without cardiogenic 
shock in order to maintain stable hemodynamics until the sched￾uled LVAD implantation, and such patients were assigned to 
INTERMACS profile 2; 31 patients (81.6%) had dilated cardio￾myopathy, 2 (5.3%) had the dilated phase of hypertrophic car￾diomyopathy, and 5 (13.2%) had ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
All of the 22 patients who underwent implantation of extra￾corporeal PF LVAD were assigned to INTERMACS profile 1 
or 2 preoperatively. As described in the Methods section, we 
excluded patients with PF LVAD who had early RVF periop￾eratively. Nonetheless, patients with PF LVAD were sicker than 
those with CF LVAD, and had more advanced end-organ dys￾function. Patients with PF LVAD had higher right atrial pres￾sure and lower cardiac output together with lower RVSWI com￾pared with the CF LVAD group preoperatively. 
Concomitant TAP was performed in 16 patients (42.1%) at 
the time of CF LVAD implantation, whereas none in the PF 
LVAD group received TAP. After CF LVAD implantation, 
none of the patients developed early RVF.

Small LV and RVF After CF LVAD Implantation 631
initiation of LVAD support for several reasons. With improved 
cardiac output, there is a sudden increase in venous return and 
RV preload. Perioperative volume loading from transfusions 
or fluid resuscitation can also augment the RV filling pres￾sure.22,23 Recent studies have demonstrated that preoperative 
factors of potential RV dysfunction suggested by cardiopul￾monary hemodynamics (RVSWI or CVP/PCWP ratio), echo￾cardiographic findings (impaired RV systolic function and re￾duced tricuspid annular motion), or laboratory results (hepatic 
congestion or coagulopathy) portend an increased risk of de￾veloping post-LVAD RVF.5,9,13,18,24 Preoperative cardiogenic 
shock requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, con￾tinuous hemodialysis or respiratory support, or evidence of end￾organ dysfunction are also associated with an increased risk 
for postoperative RVF.5,10,14,18 Accordingly, early RVF will 
emerge by the aforementioned mechanism in very sick patients, 
probably with latent RV dysfunction. 
What is Late-Onset RVF After LVAD Implantation?
On the other hand, late-onset RVF, which becomes apparent 
several weeks after surgery, has recently become an increasing 
concern. Late-onset RVF has a different clinical status to early 
RVF, and is hard to predict using the previously reported pre￾operative risk factors for early RVF.13,19,25 We previously re￾ported a patient who developed late-onset RVF with progressive 
TR and enlargement of the RV cavity together with persistent 
low cardiac output and reduced exercise tolerability. RVF in 
that patient emerged approximately 1 month after CF LVAD 
implantation despite not having preoperative risk factors for 
early RVF.19 Consistently, any patient who had late-onset RVF 
in the present study did not show the management criteria for 
early RVF. None of the previously reported risk factors for 
early RVF, including RVSWI, CVP/PCWP ratio, and RVFRS, 
was an independent parameter that predicted late-onset RVF. 
Definition of Late-Onset RVF After LVAD Implantation
Because there is not an established definition for late-onset RVF 
thus far, we defined it as RVSWI <4.0g/m2 at any rotation speed 
or under saline infusion at 5 weeks after LVAD implantation. 
We applied several rotation speeds or performed saline infusion 
test to change the preload of the RV. In patients with late-onset 
RVF, RVSWI did not change even if RV preload was increased 
by saline infusion, whereas in patients without late-onset RVF, 
RVSWI significantly increased together with incremental RV 
preload. In other words, the Frank-Starling law of the RV did 
not work in the late-onset RVF group after CF LVAD implan￾tation (ie, failing RV).26 In any of the patients with a CF LVAD, 
there were no evidence of the “suck down” phenomenon, even 
at the highest speed tested. The rationale for our definition of 
late-onset RVF lies in the fact that patients with late-onset RVF 
had a shorter 6-min walking distances, lower peak V˙ O2, wors￾ened TR and enlargement of the RV cavity, higher mRAP and 
lower CI, and higher plasma levels of B-type natriuretic pep￾were significant risk factors for late-onset RVF. Preoperative 
parameters, including RVSWI, CVP/PCWP ratio, and scoring 
systems for early RVF, failed to predict late-onset RVF. Post￾operative LVDd had a strong correlation with preoperative 
LVDd (P<0.001 and r=0.720), and postoperative LVDd was 
significantly associated with late-onset RVF, but we did not 
choose such postoperative parameters because of their lack of 
predictability. Additionally, the %change in LVDd was not a 
significant predictor for late-onset RVF (P=0.288, OR 0.967; 
95% confidence interval 0.909–1.029). 
ROC analysis showed a high area under curve (AUC) with 
cutoff points of LVDd ≤64mm, LVDd/body surface area 
≤43mm, and LVMI ≤135g/m2 for the prediction of late-onset 
RVF after CF LVAD implantation (AUC, 0.925, 0.863, and 
0.871, respectively). LVDd ≤64mm had a higher OR than LVMI 
≤135g/m2 and LVDd/body surface area ≤43mm (100.1 vs. 
18.00 vs. 9.000, respectively). 
In contrast, univariable analyses demonstrated that there were 
no statistically significant preoperative parameters, including 
LVDd, for the prediction of RVSWI <4.0g/m2 after PF LVAD 
implantation (data not shown). 
Concomitant TAP and Worsening of TR After CF LVAD 
Implantation 
TR worsened in 4 of 12 patients (33.3%) with preoperative 
LVDd ≤64mm, albeit TR worsened in only 1 of 26 patients 
(3.8%) with preoperative LVDd >64mm (P<0.001). Proportions 
of patients who received concomitant TAP were not different 
between the LVDd ≤64mm group and the LVDd >64mm group 
(41.7% vs. 42.3%, P=0.842). There were no patients who suf￾fered severe TR after the TAP operation; 1 patient with late￾onset RVF, who did not receive TAP because her preoperative 
TR grade was mild, suffered severe TR after CF LVAD im￾plantation. There was no case of failed tricuspid valve repair.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that a smaller preoperative LVDd 
is a risk factor for late-onset RVF after implantation of a CF 
LVAD, when RVSWI remained <4.0g/m2 at any rotation speed 
or by saline infusion despite no evidence of postoperative early 
RVF. Surprisingly, there were no such trends among the pa￾tients who received a PF LVAD. 
Early RVF After LVAD Implantation
Although the definition of RVF after LVAD implantation var￾ies in the previous studies, most investigators define postopera￾tive RVF by management criteria including intravenous inotro￾pic treatment for >2 weeks and/or inhalation of nitric monoxide 
>48h, or mechanical support of the RV. Such a conventional 
form of RVF usually manifests perioperatively or soon after 
surgery, and we call this type of RVF “early”. 
Generally speaking, RV wall stress increases markedly at the

meet with sufficiently higher CI probably because of RV fail￾ure. Fluid replacement significantly increased the mRAP in 
them, whereas cardiac output remained low because of the loss 
of the Frank-Starling mechanism in the failed RV. It is there￾fore recommended to regulate rotation speed as low as possible 
under echocardiographic monitoring in order to avoid further 
progression of RV geometric remodeling or to institute ap￾propriate diuresis in order to unload the RV.7,23 We adjusted 
the daily rotation speed to the lowest possible that maintained 
cardiac output. However, the lowest rotation speed tested only 
gives a CI of 2.0L·min−1 ·m−2 in patients with late-onset RVF 
(Table S1). Especially in patients with advanced HF, we can￾not set a much lower speed to meet their circulatory demand 
for the improvement of end-organ dysfunction. We have to say 
that there is virtually no room for rotational adjustment in pa￾tients with a smaller LV cavity to avoid both late-onset RVF and 
low cardiac output simultaneously. 
Concomitant TAP with LVAD implantation is also essential 
to avoid postoperative increases in RV preload because of wors￾ening TR.7 Consistently, TR did not worsen after CF LVAD 
implantation in 5 of 6 patients (83.3%) with late-onset RVF who 
received TAP perioperatively. Among 14 patients with late-onset 
RVF, postoperative tricuspid valve diameter in patients undergo￾ing TAP was smaller than in those without TAP after CF LVAD 
implantation, though statistically insignificant (38.2±6.4 vs. 
40.9±6.3mm, P=0.115 by unpaired t-test). We have routinely 
performed TAP when patients have moderate to severe TR pre￾operatively, but that policy may have to be changed in patients 
with a small LV cavity who have only mild TR preoperatively. 
In fact, a patient with such a condition had more severe TR after 
CF LVAD implantation.19
PF LVAD and Late-Onset RVF
Until recently, extracorporeal PF LVAD was the only mechani￾cal device available in Japan, and is still an essential device, 
especially as a bridge to decision.33 In contrast to the CF LVAD, 
there was no relationship between LV size and postoperative 
RVSWI in the PF LVAD group in the present study. Although 
LV cavity decreases under PF LVAD support in the same man￾ner as with the CF device, intermittent blood removal from the 
LV inflow cannula may preserve autochthonous septum function 
and prevent RV geometric remodeling. In fact, the inflow can￾nula of the Nipro PF VAD is identical to that of the DuraHeart 
in size, but the DuraHeart is similarly associated with late-onset 
RVF as the EVAHEART and HeartMate II, which have a larger 
inflow cannula. Therefore, the size of the inflow cannula may 
not really matter for the occurrence of late-onset RVF. Likewise, 
the intermittent low speed mode of the Jarvik 2000 may pos￾sibly prevent such geometric remodeling,34 although it has not 
yet been approved in Japan as of October 2013. 
Study Limitations
We acknowledge that our study has several limitations. 
1. This study was conducted in a single center, and conse￾quently included a limited number of patients. Although the 
actual cutoff point of LVDd may change in larger studies in 
the future, we would like to emphasize that a preoperative 
smaller LVDd was the only predictor for late-onset RVF. 
2. All data were analyzed in a retrospective manner. Our 
results should be tested in a prospective manner. 
3. Hemodynamic studies were not executed in consecutive 
patients who received extracorporeal PF LVAD implantation, 
and in particular, severe patients who had received biventricu￾lar assist devices or suffered early RVF were excluded. There￾fore, we could not avoid patient selection bias completely 
tide after CF LVAD implantation.
Preoperative Smaller LVDd and Late-Onset RVF After LVAD 
Implantation
Among the many preoperative parameters, we demonstrated that 
smaller LVDd was an independent risk factor for late-onset 
RVF after CF LVAD treatment. A few authors, including us, 
recently reported that a smaller LVDd had a close relationship 
with post-LVAD mortality.12,14,21 Patients with a preoperative 
small LVDd had a proportionally small LVDd after CF LVAD 
implantation, and poor prognosis after LVAD implantation ap￾pears to be associated with a postoperative small LV cavity. We 
have to emphasize that a smaller LV cavity was not a result of 
a “suck down” event by inappropriately high rotation speed as 
we described before. The LVDd adjusted by body surface area 
and LVMI were also significant predictors for late-onset RVF, 
but their ORs were lower than that for the LVDd value itself. 
The absolute LV dimensions may really matter in terms of the 
occurrence of late-onset RVF. 
Is the aforementioned result also applicable to pediatric pa￾tients, who all have a small LV cavity? Although early RVF 
occurs more frequently in them than in adults, according to 
several reports, there has been no report discussing late-onset 
RVF after LVAD implantation in pediatric patients, which is 
partly because the duration of LVAD support is too short for 
late-onset RVF to be observed.27–29 Another reason for the lack 
of late-onset RVF observable in children may be that few large 
studies have analyzed CF LVAD usage except for small stud￾ies’ experience of the child-size Jarvik 2000 device.28,30 A lon￾ger observational study analyzing RV function in pediatric pa￾tients with a CF LVAD is anticipated. 
Mechanisms for Late-Onset RVF After LVAD Implantation
Mechanisms for late-onset RVF have not been explored well. 
If the LV volume is decreased remarkably by the CF LVAD, 
the interventricular septum shifts toward the LV side in a con￾tinuous manner, which may create wall stress and reduce RV 
contractility. Subsequent changes in RV geometry and annular 
dilatation reduce tricuspid valve coaptation, instigating a vicious 
cycle of progressive TR without pulmonary hypertension and 
increased RV preload, which constitutes chronic development 
of RVF.7,22,25,31 This hypothesis may well explain the time course 
of late-onset RVF.
Kato et al reported that a preoperative small LVDd was a 
predictor for early RVF after LVAD implantation, because it 
may be related to constrictive etiology on both sides of the 
heart.24 Latent RV dysfunction may exist in patients with a small 
LVDd who often have an etiology of hypertrophic or restric￾tive cardiomyopathy. Not only early RVF but also late-onset 
RVF complicate such patients by way of disease progression 
in RV. In fact, 2 patients with the dilated phase of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy suffered late-onset RVF and in both the LVDd 
was consistently less than 64mm. However, among 5 patients 
with ischemic etiology whose preoperative RV function was 
fairly intact, 3 patients (60.0%) with a smaller LV cavity devel￾oped late-onset RVF after CF LVAD implantation. Therefore, 
we believe that late-onset RVF is not merely a manifestation 
of myocardial disease of the RV but is a result of geometric 
alteration caused by CF LVAD implantation. 
Managing Late-Onset RVF After LVAD Implantation
How can we manage patients with late-onset RVF? In general, 
incremental rotation speed or fluid replacement may be effec￾tive in ameliorating low output during LVAD support.32 In pa￾tients with late-onset RVF, incremental rotation speed did not
