Abstract
Triglycerides (TG) are synthesized in the liver principally
from two sources of fatty acids (FA): FA synthesized de
novo in the liver and preformed FA. We have measured the
rate of secretion of de novo synthesized FA and total secre￾tion of FA bound to VLDL-TG in healthy men (n 5 5) in
the basal state, and after 1 (day 1) and 4 d (day 4) of a hy￾percaloric carbohydrate diet (< 2.5 times energy expenditure)
that generated a moderate endogenous hyperinsulinemia
(plasma insulin < 60 mU/ml). Prolonged carbohydrate hy￾peralimentation/hyperinsulinemia increased plasma VLDL￾TG < 10-fold in part due to a 3.4-fold increase in total
VLDL-TG secretion rate (basal state 5 72623, day 4 5
242678 mmol TG/kg/d). Although the secretion of de novo
synthesized FA increased throughout the study (basal state
5 1.160.4, day 1 5 15.967.9, day 4 5 50.0618.8 mmol TG/
kg/d), the 2.7-fold increase in secretion rate of preformed
FA (basal state 5 70623, day 4 5 191657 mmol TG/kg/d)
quantitatively contributed the most to total VLDL-TG se￾cretion rate. Decreased catabolism of VLDL-TG also con￾tributed to the hypertriglyceridemia as reflected by an ap￾proximately fourfold decrease in both fractional turnover
rate (basal state 5 9.263.8, day 1 5 2.160.2, day 4 5
2.160.3 pools/d) and rate of clearance (basal state 5
0.3560.08, day 1 5 0.1160.01, day 4 5 0.0960.01 liter/kg/
d) of VLDL-TG. Thus, the primary difference between 1
and 4 d of hyperinsulinemia in conjunction with carbohy￾drate hyperalimentation is the increase in hepatic secretion
of preformed FA into VLDL-TG. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:

Introduction
The metabolic link between insulin resistance and the associ￾ated risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, es￾pecially dyslipidemia, has been the focus of intensive investiga￾tion in recent years. Of the several abnormalities in lipoprotein
metabolism associated with insulin resistance, hypertriglyceri￾demia is the most common (1–3) and of particular interest and
significance because of the growing awareness that hypertri￾glyceridemia itself may be important in atherogenesis (4–6).
Whereas it is generally agreed that hypertriglyceridemia in
insulin-resistant states results from a combination of an over￾production of VLDL particles in the liver and a decreased ca￾tabolism of triglycerides (TGs)1
 peripherally (2, 7, 8), the exact
cause of the abnormality remains controversial. Although hy￾perinsulinemia has been commonly thought of as a promoter
of TG production (9, 10), no causal relationship has been
found between hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia in
human subjects. Thus, while studies using perfused rat livers
have generally shown an acute stimulatory effect of insulin
(11), experimentally induced acute hyperinsulinemia sup￾presses VLDL-TG production in human subjects (12). Under
most conditions, hepatic TGs are predominantly produced
from the reesterification of FAs cleared from the plasma, and
consequently the delivery of FFA to the liver has often been
cited as the most important factor controlling VLDL-TG se￾cretion (13). This strong relationship between lipolysis and
VLDL-TG production makes a stimulatory effect of insulin on
VLDL-TG production unlikely, because insulin is a potent in￾hibitor of lipolysis (14). Thus, peripheral resistance to the anti￾lipolytic effect of insulin may be necessary for a direct stimula￾tory effect of insulin on VLDL-TG secretion to be observed in
vivo (15). Alternatively, it is possible that insulin stimulates
VLDL-TG output by stimulating de novo FA synthesis (16).
However, recent data directly quantifying the contribution of
newly synthesized FAs to VLDL-TG secretion during high
carbohydrate ingestion give reason to question the physiologi￾cal importance of this source of FAs in the production of
VLDL-TG (17). Finally, it is possible that insulin does not play
a direct role in the regulation of hepatic VLDL-TG production
and that VLDL-TG production is increased in insulin-resistant
states because of hyperglycemia. This notion is supported by
the observation that the infusion of glucose into dogs in which
changes in plasma insulin and glucagon were prevented none￾theless resulted in a significant increase in VLDL-TG secre￾tion (18).
The first step in determining the respective roles of chronic
elevations in insulin and glucose in the kinetics of VLDL-TG
in human subjects is to establish a model in which hyperin￾sulinemia is associated with hypertriglyceridemia and to deter￾mine the relative contributions of preformed and de novo syn￾thesized FA to the accelerated rate of VLDL-TG production
in that circumstance. To accomplish this goal, we have used a
chronic (4-d) hypercaloric high-carbohydrate feeding regimen
that produces hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. We have
used a new model of lipid kinetics based on the mass isoto￾pomer distribution analysis technique (19–21) to quantify the
major pathways of VLDL-TG production (secretion of pre￾formed FA and secretion of de novo synthesized FA) and the

total rate of VLDL-TG secretion. We studied the subjects be￾fore and 1 and 4 d after the start of the hypercaloric carbohy￾drate diet in order to document possible changes which may
occur over time in the effectiveness of endogenous insulin to
stimulate glucose uptake and to suppress lipolysis.
Methods
Subjects. Five normal male volunteers (age 3164), three black and
two white, participated in the study. They were healthy, as indicated
by medical history and physical examination, were of normal weight
(body mass index), were taking no medications, and had normal
blood chemistries (liver function tests, thyroid function test, plasma
glucose, plasma insulin or serum lipids) and hematologic parameters.
The subjects were admitted on two occasions to the Clinical Research
Center, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, for the
performance of the experiments. The study was approved by the in￾stitutional review board of University of Texas Medical Branch at
Galveston. Informed consent was obtained for all procedures.
Experimental protocol. Three tracer infusion studies were per￾formed on each subject; after an overnight fast (basal state) and after
1 and 4 d of hypercaloric carbohydrate feeding (days 1 and 4) (Fig. 1).
The studies were performed no less than 3 d apart to allow for isotope
washout. The basal state value was determined in the first session.
The values after 1 (day 1) and 4 d (day 4) of hypercaloric carbohy￾drate feeding were determined in the second session.
The subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Center the
night before the first infusion study. They were given a standard meal
and then no more meals throughout the study. The next day at 7 a.m.
a constant infusion of glucose at 2 mg/kg per min was started through
a catheter placed in the antecubital vein (Fig. 1). Glucose was infused
to promote a measurable rate of hepatic FA synthesis, which was re￾quired by the model. This infusion rate was chosen because it is well
below the maximal capacity for glucose oxidation in humans (22, 23)
and allowed us to provide the subjects with z 50% of their estimated
energy demands during the study. The isotope infusion was started at
8 a.m. (Fig. 1). After completion of this basal state study, the subjects
were discharged.
For the second infusion study the subjects were admitted at noon
the day before the infusion study. They had been instructed not to eat
on the day of admission. At 2 p.m. an 8 french nasogastric feeding
tube was placed into the upper gastrointestinal tract. Proper position￾ing was confirmed by auscultation and aspiration of gastric fluid. At 3
p.m. a constant infusion of intravenous glucose at 2 mg/kg per min
was started through a catheter placed in the antecubital vein. At the
same time, nasogastric feeding with a liquid meal (Vivonex; Sandoz
Nutrition Corp., Minneapolis, MN) was started. Vivonex had been di￾luted to a caloric density of 1 kcal/ml (80.4 grams/250 ml water; total
volume 300 ml) with an energy distribution of 83% carbohydrates,
15% amino acids, and 2% fat (linoleic acid). The carbohydrates were
derived from partially hydrolyzed corn starch. A comparable diet has
been shown to eliminate the influx of chylomicrons into circulation
during feeding (24). The feeding was started at an initial rate of 50 ml/h
and gradually increased over the next 6 h to a final rate of 2 ml/kg/h,
i.e., 50 kcal?kg21d
21
. The nasogastric feeding and intravenous glucose
infusion was maintained night and day throughout the study (Fig. 1).
Thus, the background 13C enrichment was constant during the tracer
infusion. At the final rate a total of 8.7 mg/kg/min of carbohydrate
was provided; 6.7 mg/kg/min was delivered through the nasogastric
tube and 2 mg/kg/min through the intravenous infusion. The total
amount of calories provided was < 60 kcal/kg/d with z 90% from
carbohydrates. In addition, the subjects had free access to carbohy￾drate containing liquids without caffeine. This intake was not re￾corded since it did not exceed 1–4% of the daily caloric intake.
The carbohydrate delivery rate, based upon our previous long￾term glucose infusion studies (22), was chosen in order to elicit an in￾sulin response sufficient to maintain the plasma insulin concentration
between 50 and 70 mU/ml.
Tracer infusion. Teflon catheters were placed percutaneously
into an antecubital vein, and a sampling catheter was inserted in a
dorsal hand vein of the contralateral arm. The heated hand technique
was used to obtain arterialized blood samples (25). After a blood
sample was drawn to determine background enrichment, a constant
infusion of [1,2-13C]acetate (99% enriched; Isotec Inc., Miamisburg,
OH; 2 mmol/kg?min, no prime) was started at 8 a.m. 6 h into the infu￾sion study (2 p.m.) a primed constant infusion of [2H5
]glycerol (98%
enriched; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA; 0.1 mmol/
kg?min; prime 1.5 mmol/kg) was started. The exact infusion rate for
glycerol was determined by measuring the concentration in the infu￾sate. Both isotopes were infused using calibrated syringe pumps
(Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA).
Blood sampling. Blood to measure VLDL-TG kinetics was taken
0, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, and 600 min after the beginning of
the infusion study and placed into 10-ml vacutainers containing diso￾dium EDTA. Blood to measure glycerol kinetics was taken 480, 510,
540, and 600 min after the beginning of the infusion study (120, 150,
180, and 210 min after start of labeled glycerol infusion) and placed
into 10-ml vacutainers containing lithium heparin. All samples were
placed on ice. Plasma was separated by centrifugation shortly after
sampling. Samples for VLDL isolation were stored at 48C until they
were processed the next morning. All other samples were stored at
2208C until they were processed.
Sample analysis. VLDL was isolated from 3 ml of plasma by
overlaying the plasma with a density 5 1.006 solution (0.9% NaCl)
and spinning it in a 70.1 Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm (171,500 g average) for
20 h at 158C in an ultracentrifuge (model L7-55; Beckman Instru￾ments, Palo Alto, CA). After ultracentrifugation, the VLDL-TG was
carefully removed along with the density solution found on top of the
tube by the slicing tube technique (26, 27). The total volume of the re￾sulting VLDL suspension was 3 ml.
TG concentration in the VLDL suspension and in plasma was de￾termined enzymatically (RA-500; Technicon Instruments Corp., Tar￾rytown, NY) (28). Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were
Figure 1. Experimental design. Each subject underwent a study in 
the basal state and during short (day 1) and prolonged (day 4) carbo￾hydrate hyperalimentation. The studies were performed no less than 
3 d apart to allow for isotope washout. In each study, labeled acetate 
was infused intravenously for 600 min to measure VLDL-TG kinetics 
and labeled glycerol was infused during the last 210 min to measure 
rate of adipose tissue lipolysis. Indirect calorimetry was used to calcu￾late rate of fat oxidation.

measured using an automated analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument
Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Plasma insulin concentration was mea￾sured by radioimmunoassay (Instar Corp., Stillwater, MI).
TG in the VLDL suspension were isolated by thin-layer chroma￾tography, hydrolyzed to FFA, and derivatized to FA methyl esters.
Relative concentrations of individual FAs in the VLDL fraction were
determined by gas chromatography (model 5890; Hewlett-Packard
Co., Palo Alto, CA). Isotopic enrichment of selected FAs was deter￾mined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (model
5992; Hewlett-Packard Co.) in the electron impact ionization mode
for the ultimate computation of the tracer/tracee ratio. For the palmi￾tate methyl ester the ions of mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) 270, 271, 272,
273, and 274 were selectively monitored, for the methyl ester of ole￾ate the ions of mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) 296, 297, 298, 299, and 300
were monitored, and for the methyl ester of stearate the ions of mass￾to-charge ratio (m/e) 298, 299, 300, 301, and 302 were monitored. Iso￾topic enrichment of glycerol was determined by GC-MS (model 5985;
Hewlett-Packard Co.) by following previously described procedures
(29). Ions of m/e 205 and 208 were monitored.
Calculations. Rate of appearance (Ra) of glycerol was calculated
with use of a steady state equation since sample analysis indicated
that a physiological and isotopic steady state existed during infusion
period (30). Glycerol Ra
 was used as a reflection of lipolysis, with the
assumption that all glycerol released in the process of lipolysis, whether
in the adipose tissue or in muscle tissue, appears in the plasma. This is
because glycerol reutilization requires phosphorylation via the en￾zyme glycerol kinase, and this occurs mainly in the liver (31). Also,
glycerol cannot be produced in the body, other than from lipolysis
(32), and the results of this study showed that the contribution of the
hydrolysis of plasma TG to Ra
 glycerol could not account for . 10%
of Ra
 glycerol, and in most cases much less than that. Consequently,
the glycerol Ra
 equals total lipolysis, and FFA release has been as￾sumed to be three to one for every glycerol released since there is essen￾tially no partial hydrolysis of TG. Any release of glycerol by omental
adipocytes that is cleared on the first pass of the liver would cause an
underestimation of whole body lipolysis with this methodology. How￾ever, evidence from dogs indicates that the amount of glycerol re￾leased into the portal vein that is cleared on the first pass of the liver
is a small percentage of total Ra
 glycerol (33). Although there may be
a difference between dogs and humans, our subjects were lean and
had normal body mass index, so it is reasonable to presume that they
did not have a disproportionately high omental compared with whole
body lipolytic activity. With these assumptions in mind, the Ra
 glyc￾erol is used to calculate the lower limit for whole body lipolysis.
Measurement of the rate at which de novo synthesized palmitate is
secreted as VLDL-TG. The enrichment (p) of the intrahepatic pre￾cursor pool for FA synthesis (hepatic acetyl-CoA) was deduced ac￾cording to the mass isotopomer method as initially outlined by
Hellerstein et al. (19, 34) with some later modifications (35). To cal￾culate the fractional rate of secretion of VLDL-bound palmitate
(FRS), we used the formula FSR 5 [(E(t2) 2 E(t1))/(t2 2 t1)]/[8p(1 2
p)
7
]; where t1
 and t2
 are the times when samples are taken and E(t) is
the doubly labeled enrichment at time t. FSR is thus defined as the
fraction of the plasma VLDL-bound palmitate pool, per unit of time,
that is newly synthesized.
The differences between this formula and the traditional formula (36)
for calculation of FSR are the factor of eight in the denominator and the
factor (1 2 p)7
. The factor of eight accounts for the fact that it requires
eight acetate molecules to form one palmitate molecule. The factor of
(1 2 p)7
 accounts for the probability that seven acetate molecules which
are not labeled will be incorporated into a palmitate molecule (35).
To obtain absolute synthesis rates, the fractional synthetic rate
was multiplied by the pool size of VLDL-bound palmitate. The pool
size was estimated by multiplying the measured value of VLDL-TG
concentration by the relative concentration of palmitate in the
VLDL-TG fraction times the assumed plasma volume of 37 ml/kg (37).
Measurement of total rate of VLDL-bound palmitate secretion.
The total rate of VLDL-bound palmitate secretion rate is calculated
from the measured rate at which de novo synthesized palmitate is se￾creted into the VLDL palmitate pool. Briefly, we can obtain the per￾centage of VLDL-bound palmitate which is derived from de novo
produced palmitate (% d.n.VLDL palmitate) from the extent of dilu￾tion which occurs between the precursor and the product. The spe￾cific formula is % d.n.VLDL palmitate 5 [plateau enrichment of m 1
2 labeled palmitate/(8 3 p)]/(1 2 p)
7
.
The total rate of VLDL-bound palmitate secretion is then calcu￾lated by dividing the rate at which de novo synthesized palmitate is
secreted as VLDL by the percentage of VLDL-bound palmitate
which is derived from de novo produced palmitate (% d.n.VLDL
palmitate). If a plateau was not been reached during the infusion
time, the extrapolated value for the plateau enrichment was used to
calculate the total secretion rate.
Measurement of total VLDL-bound FA kinetics. Quantitatively,
palmitate (C16:0), oleate (C18:1), stearate (C18:0), linoleate (C18:2),
and palmitoleate (C16:1) make up . 97% of the FAs of VLDL￾bound TGs. To measure the total VLDL-bound TG secretion rate,
the secretion rates of VLDL-bound stearate, oleate, and linoleate
were measured principally as described for VLDL-bound palmitate
except with minor modifications. In our calculations, the production
and secretion of palmitoleate was considered to be the same as pal￾mitate, and thus the two VLDL pools were combined in our calcula￾tions. This approach is justified by the fact that the synthesis of pal￾mitoleate (C16:1) proceeds through the initial synthesis of palmitate
(C16) and that the final desaturation step is the only differentiating
step in their synthesis. Furthermore, during the study the concentra￾tion of the two FAs relative to each other remained constant in the
FFA pool and the VLDL-TG pool. This suggests that the relative flux
of the two FAs was the same throughout the study.
To differentiate between the secretion rate of de novo synthe￾sized, elongated, or reesterified C18 FAs certain assumptions were
made. It is known that palmitate is the primary product of de novo
FA synthesis in the liver and that the C18 FAs such as stearate (C18:
0) and oleate (C18:1) are the products of elongation and desaturation
of palmitate (38, 39). As such, the VLDL-bound stearate and oleate
can principally come from three sources: from de novo synthesized
palmitate (C16:0) with all its acetate molecules coming from the he￾patic acetate pool and getting one more acetate unit to become stea￾rate (C18:0) or undergoing further desaturation to become oleate
(C18:1); from palmitate that is initially taken up from the plasma and
elongated by the addition of one acetate molecule from the hepatic
pool to become stearate and oleate; and from uptake from plasma
and subsequent reesterification into VLDL-TG. In this study the
term “de novo synthesized” is preserved for the first alternative,
where all the acetate units of the FA are derived from the hepatic
pool. The second and third alternatives are collectively termed re￾esterification. As such, reesterification encompasses both the process
by which palmitate is taken up from plasma and elongated into a C18
FA for subsequent secretion and the process by which stearate and
oleate (C18 FA) themselves are taken up from plasma and reesteri￾fied into VLDL-TG. Labeling of stearate and oleate with one labeled
acetate molecule can be the consequence of elongation of any palmi￾tate, de novo synthesized or not. C18 FAs containing multiple labeled
acetate molecules (2, 3....8) can only be the elongated product of de
novo synthesized palmitate. To obtain more than one labeled acetate
molecule, the C18 FA must have had labeled palmitate as the imme￾diate precursor (palmitate with a minimum of one labeled acetate
unit must be de novo synthesized since elongation of shorter chain
FAs is not a major pathway [38]). For this reason, we calculated the
FSR for the C18 FAs using their doubly labeled isotopomers (two la￾beled acetate molecules) rather than singly labeled stearate and ole￾ate using the formula FSR 5 [(E(t2) 2 E(t1))/(t2 2 t1)]/[36p
2
(1 2 p)
7
];
where t1
 and t2
 are the times when samples are taken and E(t) is the
doubly labeled enrichment at time t.
The denominator 36p2
(1 2 p)7
 represents the probability that two
labeled acetate molecules will be incorporated into stearate or oleate
(m 1 4 FAs), given that the enrichment of the acetyl-CoA pool is p.

VLDL-Triglyceride Kinetics 2011
We used the value of p obtained from VLDL palmitate, since palmi￾tate, stearate, and oleate are all derived from the same acetyl CoA
pool. For subject MG on day 1 the p value was obtained from VLDL
stearate and not from VLDL palmitate because the palmitate had no
detectable enrichment at this time point. Because stearate and oleate
are synthesized from nine rather than eight acetyl-CoA molecules,
the calculation of total VLDL-bound stearate and oleate secretion is
otherwise the same as for palmitate except that percent VLDL is cal￾culated using the formula %VLDL 5 plateau enrichment/(9 3 pre￾cursor enrichment)/(1 2 p)
8
.
Linoleate is an essential FA, meaning that it is not synthesized.
Thus, the only quantity to be computed regarding linoleate is the se￾cretion rate of VLDL-bound linoleate. This is computed by multiply￾ing the VLDL palmitate secretion rate by the ratio of percent li￾noleate abundance to percent palmitate abundance in VLDL as
determined by gas chromatography.
The fractional turnover rate (FTR) of the VLDL-TG pool was
calculated by dividing the rate of secretion of VLDL-TG with the
pool size of the VLDL-bound TGs, assuming that the pool size was
constant. With the same assumption, VLDL-TG clearance rate was
calculated as rate of uptake (= secretion) divided by the concentra￾tion of VLDL-TG.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as mean and SEM,
except for the individually tabulated results. Comparisons of groups
were performed by means of ANOVA. When ANOVA demon￾strated statistical significance, Fisher’s least significant difference test
was used to compare differences between groups. Statistical signifi￾cance was accepted at # 0.05.
Results
All subjects completed the study. The intravenous infusion
and the nasogastric feeding (combined enteral and parenteral
feeding) were maintained uninterrupted during the 4 d of the
hyperinsulinemia period except for an interruption of z 15
min every morning to change infusion lines.
The ratio between erythrocyte volume and plasma volume,
i.e., hematocrit, was unchanged during the study. This was ex￾pected, since the amount of blood withdrawn during each infu￾sion study was , 2% of estimated total blood volume and this
amount of blood loss should not have affected erythrocyte vol￾ume. Thus, plasma volume during the same period was as￾sumed to be unchanged.
Body weight, glucose, insulin, and lactate concentration
The average body weight tended to increase throughout the
study, from 7363 kg in the basal state to 7464 and 7564 kg af￾ter 1 and 4 d of hyperalimentation, respectively. This increase
was not statistically significant. A slight but statistically insig￾nificant increase in plasma glucose concentration was observed
when the hypercaloric carbohydrate intake was started, i.e.,
going from basal state to day 1 (Fig. 2). During the ongoing hy￾percaloric carbohydrate intake, the plasma glucose concentra￾tion remained constant at a level of < 7 mmol/liter. The
plasma insulin concentration was 10.861.5 mU/ml in the basal
state. After 1 d of the combined enteral and parenteral hy￾peralimentation, the insulin concentration was elevated to
59.6612 mU/ml. It remained at this level of < 60 mU/ml
throughout the hypercaloric carbohydrate intake period (day
4) (Fig. 2). The plasma lactate concentration increased signifi￾cantly during the study from an initial value of 1.060.06 in the
basal state to 1.660.18 on day 1 and 2.660.46 mmol/liter on
day 4.
Plasma lipids
The average value for total plasma TG concentration was
0.9260.2 mmol TG/liter during the basal state and increased
slightly but not significantly during early carbohydrate hyper￾alimentation/hyperinsulinemia (day 1). After 4 d of carbohy￾drate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia (day 4), total plasma
TG concentration had increased significantly to 4.3461.61
mmol TG/liter (Table I).
The average VLDL-TG concentration increased slightly
but not statistically from the basal state to day 1 (Table I). On
day 1, there was considerable individual variability. One sub￾ject had an < 50% drop in VLDL-TG concentration (DM),
two were unchanged (JW and MG), and two increased their
VLDL-TG concentration < 200% (DK and EB) (Data not

shown). After 4 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperin￾sulinemia (day 4), all of the subjects had increased VLDL-TG
concentration, and the average increased from 0.3060.08
mmol TG/liter on day 0 to 2.9361.22 mmol TG/liter on day 4
(Table I).
The size of the VLDL-TG pool size was calculated from
the measured VLDL-TG concentration multiplied by assumed
plasma volume (37 ml/kg) and normalized for body weight.
Initially the VLDL-TG pool size was 11.063.3 mmol TG/kg.
After 4 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia
(day 4), the pool size had increased z 10-fold to 105.6645.3
mmol TG/kg. Before and after 24 h of carbohydrate hyperali￾mentation/hyperinsulinemia (day 1), VLDL-TGs accounted
for z 30% of total TGs. By the end of the prolonged hyperin￾sulinemic period (day 4), VLDL-TGs made up 65% of total
plasma TGs.

i.e., the TTR(M 1 2) and TTR(M 1 4) ratios, were used to cal￾culate the kinetics of VLDL-bound palmitate. Fig. 3 shows a
representative example of the distribution of the two mass iso￾topomers of palmitate during the 10-h infusion of labeled ace￾tate. If either one of the enrichment curves are extrapolated to
0% enrichment, they do not intercept at time point 0 but at
some later time. This time represents the delay between the
start of the labeled acetate infusion and the first appearance of
enriched de novo synthesized palmitate in the VLDL pool. An
average delay time of z 30 min was found during all three in￾fusion studies (data not shown).
The precursor enrichment for de novo synthesized palmi￾tate (intrahepatic acetate pool) is shown in Fig. 3. An infusion
rate of 2 mmol/kg/min of [1,2-13C]acetate gave an average pre￾cursor enrichment in the basal state of 861.8%, 760.8% at
day 1 and 560.5% at day 4.
The fractional rate of secretion (FRS) of de novo synthe￾sized palmitate bound to VLDL was calculated based on the
precursor enrichment and the slope of the linear segment of
the M 1 2 isotopomer enrichment curve [TTR(M 1 2) vs.
time] (Fig. 3). The FRS was 23610%/d of the VLDL-bound
palmitate pool in the basal state. After 1 d of carbohydrate hy￾peralimentation, it increased 5.6-fold to 129640%/d (day 1)
and after prolonged hyperalimentation remained significantly
increased at a level 3.4-fold higher than the basal state value
(day 4) (Table II). To obtain the absolute rate of secretion, the
FRS of de novo synthesized palmitate was multiplied by the
pool size of VLDL-bound palmitate (Table I). The absolute
rate of secretion of de novo synthesized palmitate increased
significantly throughout the hypercaloric carbohydrate intake
from a basal state value of 2.661.2 to 40.8620.0 at day 1 and fi￾nally to 133.3642.0 mmol FA/kg/d at day 4. The total rate of
secretion of palmitate bound to VLDL (from both de novo
synthesized and preformed FA) was not significantly affected
by the early carbohydrate feeding but increased significantly
after 4 d of feeding from a value of 58624 mmol FA/kg/d at the
basal state to 3466121 mmol FA/kg/d at day 4.
Secretion of VLDL-TG
Rate of secretion of total VLDL-TG. In the basal state the
rate of secretion of VLDL-TG was 72623 mmol TG/kg/d (Ta￾ble III). After 1 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperin￾sulinemia (day 1), the total secretion rate was decreased to
52624 mmol TG/kg/d but this did not reach statistical signifi￾cance (P # 0.05). As in the case of VLDL-TG concentration,
there was a marked individual difference in response to carbo￾Figure 3. Isotopomer distribution and precursor enrichment. The top

hydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia at this time point.
After 4 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsuline￾mia, the VLDL-TG secretion rate was elevated in all subjects.
The average rate was 242678 mmol TG/kg/d, which is a 3.4-
fold increase as compared with rates in the basal state.
Rate of secretion of VLDL-TG derived from preformed
FA. The initial response (day 1) to carbohydrate hyperalimen￾tation/hyperinsulinemia was a decrease in the rate of secretion
of VLDL-TG that was derived from preformed FA. However,
after 4 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia
this response was reversed to a 2.7-fold increase in the rate of
secretion of preformed FA (Table IV).
Rate of secretion of VLDL-TG derived from de novo syn￾thesized FA. In Table V, the rates of secretion of VLDL-TG
derived from de novo synthesized FA are presented for each
subject as observed before (basal state) and during carbohy￾drate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia (days 1 and 4). Af￾ter 1 d of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia,
the average secretion of de novo synthesized fat was signifi￾cantly increased from 1.160.4 in the basal state to 15.967.9
mmol TG/kg/d (day 1). On the fourth day of carbohydrate hy￾peralimentation/hyperinsulinemia (day 4), the average secre￾tion rate of de novo synthesized FA was 50.0618.8 mmol TG/
kg/d (Table V).
Turnover time and clearance of VLDL-TG, peripheral lipolysis, 
and lipid oxidation
In the basal state the FTR of the VLDL-TG pool was 9.263.8
pools/d. Hyperinsulinemia slowed down the FTR of the
VLDL-TG pool to 2.160.2 pools/d. 4 d of carbohydrate hyper￾alimentation/hyperinsulinemia (day 4) further reduced the
FTR to 2.160.3 pools/d (Table VI). The VLDL-TG clearance
rate was also lowered by both acute (day 1) as well as pro￾longed (day 4) carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsuline￾mia. The clearance rate was significantly lowered from
0.3560.08 liter/kg/d in the basal state to 0.1160.02 and
0.0960.01 liter/kg/d at days 1 and 4, respectively. There was a
slight decrease in the rate of appearance of glycerol (Ra
 glyc￾erol) initially (day 1) and a return to normal by day 4.
Discussion
Hypertriglyceridemia is commonly associated with insulin￾resistant states, such as type II diabetes (1–3). However, the
underlying mechanisms responsible for the apparent relation￾ship between increases in insulin and TGs are unclear, in part
because previously it has not been possible to create an experi￾mental model in normal volunteers. In this experiment, we es￾tablished such a model by the prolonged (4-d) continuous in￾gestion and infusion of a hypercaloric carbohydrate diet that
produced chronic elevations in both plasma insulin and glu￾cose concentration. In this circumstance, the plasma TG con￾centration was elevated fourfold as compared with the values
in the basal state, due to both an increase in VLDL-TG secre￾tion and a decrease in VLDL-TG clearance. The accelerated
VLDL-TG production resulted primarily from increased se￾cretion of preformed FA, and to a lesser extent from increased
secretion of de novo synthesized FA. The length of time of di￾etary treatment was important. Thus, in contrast to the re￾sponse on day 4, after 1 d of diet VLDL-TG production was
lower than the basal state. Changes in the channeling of pre￾formed FA towards VLDL-TG production were prominent in
explaining the difference between the response on days 1 and
4. After 1 d of hypercaloric carbohydrate intake, VLDL-TG
output coming from preformed FA was reduced, and on day 4
the secretion of preformed FA was significantly accelerated.
Tracer technique. We have used a new approach to quan￾tify VLDL-TG kinetics. The starting point is the calculation of
the rate of de novo FA synthesis according to the mass isoto￾pomer distribution analysis, fundamentally as described by
Hellerstein et al. (19, 34). Recently, we have discussed the de￾tails of the calculations and assumptions involved in this calcu￾lation (35). The conceptual breakthrough of this methodology
is that the true precursor enrichment is determined by analysis
of the product, thereby eliminating any assumptions regarding
the unknown extent of intracellular dilution of the precursor
enrichment, as measured in plasma. Furthermore, by measur￾Table III. Total Hepatic Secretion of VLDL-TG after 1 and 4 d

2014 Aarsland et al.
ing the isotopic enrichment in multiple FAs, it was unneces￾sary to make assumptions regarding the extrapolation of the
kinetics of one FA (e.g., palmitate) to all the FAs. The kinetics
of the VLDL-TG was computed by combining the FSR of the
individual VLDL FAs with their respective VLDL pool sizes.
Several assumptions were necessary for our model. For the
calculation of the total rate of VLDL-TG secretion, we as￾sumed that VLDL-TG were distributed entirely in the plasma
pool and that, over the course of each tracer infusion, the pool
size was constant and reasonably estimated from literature val￾ues. Because of the size of the VLDL particle, it is reasonable
to assume restriction to the plasma (26). The constant hemat￾ocrit indicated that the plasma volume was constant during the
studies. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the
plasma concentration of VLDL-TG was a direct reflection of
the pool size. The concentration of VLDL normally fluctuates
over the course of the day (26). Furthermore, since the con￾centration of VLDL progressively increased over days (Table
I), in a general sense we can assume the pool size must have
been increasing to at least some extent on day 1. However, the
time course of this increase was presumably slow, since over
the time frame of our sampling, the concentration of VLDL￾TG was relatively constant.
The calculation of total VLDL-TG pool size required the
assumption of a value for plasma volume. This was unlikely to
introduce much error since the previously published range for
plasma volume in normal man is 35–40 ml/kg and the coeffi￾cient of variation is 10% (37). This means that the error in the
estimated volume of distribution was no more than 10%,
which would approximately correspond to maximum of a 10%
error in the calculated rate of total VLDL-TG secretion. Im￾portantly, there would not be a bias in the distribution of any
errors stemming from this assumption.
It was also necessary to assume that there was no recycling
of label back into TG. This is a reasonable assumption, since
most FAs in the VLDL-TG come from plasma FFA and
VLDL-TG contributes minimally to plasma FFA flux (18).
The plasma palmitate M 1 2 enrichment was never . 10% of
the enrichment measured for VLDL-bound palmitate and
most frequently was found to be below detectable levels (data
not shown). Furthermore, the isotopic equilibrium in the FA
enrichment in the TG pool confirmed that there was minimal
recycling of label, since the enrichment would have progres￾sively increased if there had been a significant amount of recy￾cling.
Label could potentially also recycle within the acetyl-CoA
pool of the liver. By recycling of acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxy￾lic acid cycle M 1 1 acetate could theoretically be generated
from M 1 2 acetate. Subsequent incorporation of two M 1 1
acetate molecules into newly synthesized FA could lead to an
overestimation of the M 1 2 isotopomer thought to be the
product of M 1 2 acetate incorporation. The most likely event
would be the incorporation of only one M 1 1 acetate that
would generate the M 1 1 isotopomer of the FA. Apparently
this did not take place to any significant extent. The M 1 1 en￾richment of palmitate bound to VLDL-TG was never . 5%
above the expected enrichment according to natural abun￾dance of 13C. Thus, intrahepatic generation of M 1 1 acetate in
the tricarboxylic acid cycle with subsequent incorporation into
newly synthesized FA appeared to be insignificant.
One advantage of the tracer model we used was that the
rate of secretion of newly synthesized FA was determined
without assumptions regarding precursor enrichment. On the
other hand, the method was limited by the requirement for a
certain amount of de novo synthesis of FA and the subsequent
secretion of these FAs as VLDL-bound FA. For this reason,
the initial basal study was performed during the infusion of
glucose at 2 mg/kg per min, rather than in the fasting state, so
that there would be at least a measurable rate of FA synthesis.
The total secretion rate of VLDL-bound FA was calculated
based on the fractional secretion rate of newly synthesized FA
that appear in VLDL-TG. The total rate of secretion of
VLDL-TG was then calculated, based on the dilution principle
from knowledge of the precursor enrichment and the product
enrichment at isotopic plateau, and from estimation of the to￾tal VLDL-TG pool size. The rate of secretion of preformed
FA was calculated as the difference between the total secre￾tion rate and the rate of secretion of newly synthesized FA.
The term preformed FA refers to the FAs that were not syn￾thesized within the liver, but rather were derived from some
other source of FA. Potential sources include the plasma FFA,
lipoprotein remnants in plasma, or TG stored in the liver (in￾trahepatic lipolysis). We did not attempt to differentiate be￾tween potential intrahepatic pools of preformed FAs.
The plasma FFA pool is known to be the quantitatively
most important contributor to the flux through the pathway of
preformed FA in man (13). Although the role of a potential in￾trahepatic storage pool of TG is largely unknown in man, it
may also play a role. In cultured hepatocytes it has been shown
that intracellular TG formed directly from extracellular FA is
stored temporarily within the cell and that FA derived from
this TG store serve as the major substrate for VLDL-TG syn￾thesis (40). The FA of the intrahepatic TG store can theoreti￾cally come from the diet (exogenous FA), from lipolysis (en￾dogenous FA), or from FA synthesized in the liver (de novo
FA). During our experiment, peripheral lipolysis was the ma￾jor source of plasma FFA and exogenous FA were not enter￾ing the system. The extent of entry of de novo synthesized FA
into a TG storage pool during the 10 h of our experiment is un￾known. However, the fact that an isotopic equilibrium in the
FA enrichment in VLDL-TG was achieved indicates that if
there was entry of newly produced, labeled FA into the intra￾hepatic TG pool, the label was leaving the pool at the same
rate. Furthermore, 10 h has been shown previously to be a suf￾ficient time for equilibration between the plasma FFA pool

and the intrahepatic TG pool (15). Consequently, whereas
some of the specific FA that were incorporated into the
VLDL-TG in the course of the study may have come from the
intrahepatic TG store, there was probably little net change in
the intrahepatic TG pool size.
The validity of our method for quantifying VLDL-TG ki￾netics is supported by the agreement between our results and
the results reported by others in comparable situations.
VLDL-TG kinetics have been measured previously using trac￾ers (41–43) as well as catheterization techniques (13, 44). Pre￾viously published rates for total VLDL-TG secretion rates in
human subjects range from 100 (24, 45) to 400 mmol TG/kg/d
(43, 44, 46). Our observed rate of total VLDL-TG secretion of
52–242 mmol TG/kg/d (Table III) is thus within the range ob￾served for normotriglyceridemic subjects. The subjects in our
study all had initial TG concentrations in the lower 50th per￾centile (Table I), which may indicate that the selected subjects
also had a secretion rate in the lower normal range (45). The
FTR of the VLDL-TG pool in the basal state was also within
the range of previously published results. In the basal state we
found that the FTR of the VLDL-TG pool was 9 d21
 as com￾pared with previously reported values of 3–14 d21
 (42, 43,
45, 46).
Experimental model of hyperinsulinemia. Whereas we were
successful in creating an experimental model in normal volun￾teers in which hyperinsulinemia was associated with hypertri￾glyceridemia, we cannot differentiate between the effects of
hyperinsulinemia and hypercaloric carbohydrate intake. This
is because of the inevitable link between an elevation in insulin
concentration and the requirement for extra glucose to avoid
hypoglycemia. This problem is not avoided with the traditional
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique (47). In that
case, extra glucose is required to maintain euglycemia, and
thus even though plasma glucose concentration is maintained
constant, the rate of glucose uptake increases markedly.
Rather, we chose to give glucose continuously, both orally and
intravenously, and thus the increase in insulin originated en￾dogenously. This approach had the practical advantage that
hyperinsulinemia could be maintained easily for several days.
Furthermore, the entry of the glucose and insulin into the body
via the portal circulation was physiological, thereby maximiz￾ing the extent of hepatic glucose uptake (48) and maintaining
the normal portal vein/arterial gradient in insulin concentra￾tion. Both of these factors may be important in producing hy￾pertriglyceridemia (1). Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia usually
occurs clinically in states such as diabetes mellitus, in conjunc￾tion with an increase in glucose concentration (49). The mod￾erately elevated TG concentrations that developed after 4 d of
hyperinsulinemia in our study were within the range fre￾quently found in subjects with glucose intolerance or early dia￾betes with maintained pancreatic secretory function (2). Simi￾lar to the hypertriglyceridemia of the insulin-resistant states,
the predominant increase in TGs was in the VLDL fraction
(Table I) (2). Collectively, these factors imply that our model
encompasses essential aspects of the hyperinsulinemia that are
associated with insulin-resistant states and the associated ef￾fects on lipid metabolism.
VLDL-TG breakdown. The magnitude of reduction in
VLDL clearance with carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyper￾insulinemia was about the same as the increase in secretion.
Thus, impaired hydrolysis either as a consequence of an al￾tered nature of the particles or a change in the removal mecha￾nism of VLDL-TG played an important role in causing hyper￾triglyceridemia. Most likely the VLDL particle increased in
size and TG content as hepatic TG secretion was increased
(26) and this could cause a decrease in their rate of removal
(50).
VLDL-TG secretion during hyperinsulinemia. After 24 h
of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia, total se￾cretion of VLDL-TG tended to decrease, but statistically this
trend was not significant due to divergent individual responses.
This variability in response is understandable when the indi￾vidual pathways are considered, because the total secretion
rate after 24 h of carbohydrate hyperalimentation/hyperin￾sulinemia was a function of two opposing trends (Tables IV
and V). The decreased secretion of preformed FA, coupled
with an increase in de novo synthesis, could explain the con￾flicting results obtained in previous studies in which acute hy￾perinsulinemia either decreased (12, 15, 50–53) or did not af￾fect (11, 54) VLDL secretion. Depending on the experimental
factors, such as the selection of subjects, whether or not they
were fasted, and in particular the duration and extent of hyper￾insulinemia, the effect on one pathway may predominate.
The results obtained on day 1 versus day 4 of carbohydrate
hyperalimentation/hyperinsulinemia emphasize the impor￾tance of the duration of the hyperinsulinemia and probably re￾flect different time-dependent effects of insulin. On day 4, to￾tal VLDL-TG secretion rate was increased 3.4-fold as
compared with the basal state. Whereas de novo synthesis was
increased after 4 d, the increase in VLDL-TG secretion was
primarily due to stimulation of the secretion of preformed FA.
The contrary was the case after short-term carbohydrate hy￾peralimentation. Total secretion of VLDL-TG tended to de￾crease on day 1, probably because of an acute insulin-mediated
inhibition of lipolysis that subsided as the hyperalimentation/
hyperinsulinemia persisted for an additional 3 d (Table VI).
A difference between acute and longer term effects of insu￾lin on VLDL-TG secretion in isolated hepatocytes has been
recognized (10, 54), but the relevance of those findings to the
in vivo situation has been uncertain, because of the mainte￾nance of a constant extracellular concentration of FFA in the
in vitro circumstance. In human subjects, chronic hyperin￾sulinemia of endogenous origin, such as that observed in obe￾sity, steroid use, or impaired glucose tolerance (55), has also
been shown to be associated with increased VLDL-TG pro￾duction. An excessive secretion of VLDL-TG has also been
observed in the majority of studies of non–insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (2). However, although hypertriglyceridemia
is associated with increased postprandial insulin concentration
(2) in non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin treat￾ment has been shown to lower VLDL-TG secretion (50), rais￾ing the possibility that increased VLDL-TG secretion is not
caused by hyperinsulinemia, per se, but rather is a phenome￾non that accompanies insulin resistance.
It is well documented that under most circumstances
plasma FFA serve as the predominant source of FAs for
VLDL-TG. Even in the extreme circumstance of 4 d of excess
carbohydrate intake we used in this study, which was designed
to maximize the rate of de novo FA synthesis, the preformed
FA were nonetheless the major source of VLDL-TG FAs.
Thus, it is not surprising that the notion has been put forth that
the rate of delivery of FAs to the liver, determined by the rate
of peripheral lipolysis, is the predominant determinant of the
rate of VLDL-TG secretion (13, 56). Whereas this may be true

2016 Aarsland et al.
in some circumstances, this explanation cannot explain the hy￾pertriglyceridemia after 4 d of hypercaloric carbohydrate in￾take in our experiment, because there was no significant in￾crease in lipolysis (i.e., Ra
 glycerol) going from the basal state
to day 4. Rather, the partitioning of plasma FFA into TG and
other pathways (b-oxidation) in the liver is a more likely ex￾planation of the time-dependent change in VLDL-TG output
between days 0 and 4 that we observed (57). After 4 d of hy￾percaloric carbohydrate feeding, most likely the liver was de￾riving virtually all of its energy from carbohydrate oxidation as
opposed to FA oxidation (58), meaning FA taken up by the
liver would be channeled into VLDL-TG.
Based on these observations, we conclude that in our study
during prolonged hyperinsulinemia the availability of pre￾formed FA for TG synthesis was the major determinant of he￾patic VLDL-TG secretion even though the availability of
de novo synthesized FAs was increased severalfold by the
prolonged intake of hypercaloric amounts of carbohydrates.
Acute but not prolonged hyperinsulinemia associated with
carbohydrate hyperalimentation has an inhibitory effect on the
secretion of preformed FA reesterified into TG in the liver. In￾creased secretion and decreased catabolism of VLDL-TG was
equally important in explaining the hypertriglyceridemia asso￾ciated with the prolonged carbohydrate hyperalimentation/
hyperinsulinemia.
