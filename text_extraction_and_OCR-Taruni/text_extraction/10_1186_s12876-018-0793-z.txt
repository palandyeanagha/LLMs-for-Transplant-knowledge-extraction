Abstract
Background: Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) is characterized by pulmonary vasoconstriction, while
hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is characterized by vasodilation. Definite POPH is a risk factor for the survival after
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), as the congestive pressure affects the grafted liver, while subclinical pulmonary
hypertension (PH) has been acknowledged as a non-risk factor for deceased donor OLT. Given that PH measurement
requires cardiac catheterization, the tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) measured by echocardiography is
used to screen for PH and congestive pressure to the liver. We investigated the impact of a subclinical high TRPG on
the survival of small grafted living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 84 LDLT candidates. Patients exhibiting a TRPG ≥25 mmHg on echocardiography
were categorized as potentially having liver congestion (subclinical high TRPG; n = 34). The mean pulmonary artery
pressure (mPAP) measured after general anesthesia with FIO20.6 (mPAP-FIO20.6) was also assessed. Patients exhibiting
pO2 < 80 mmHg and an alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO2) ≥ 15 mmHg were categorized as potentially having
HPS (subclinical HPS; n = 29). The clinical course after LDLT was investigated according to subclinical high TRPG.
Results: A subclinical high TRPG (p = 0.012) and older donor age (p = 0.008) were correlated with a poor 40-month
survival. Although a higher mPAP-FIO20.6 was expected to correlate with a worse survival, a high mPAP-FIO20.6 with a
low TRPG was associated with high frequency complicating subclinical HPS and a good survival, suggesting a reduction
in the PH pressure via pulmonary shunt.
Conclusion: In cirrhosis patients, mPAP-FIO20.6 may not accurately reflect the congestive pressure to the liver, as the
pressure might escape via pulmonary shunt. A subclinical high TRPG is an important marker for predicting a worse
survival after LDLT, possibly reflecting congestive pressure to the grafted small liver.

Background
End-stage liver cirrhosis is often complicated with pul￾monary capillary disorders. The most commonly found
pulmonary vascular complication is hepatopulmonary
syndrome (HPS), in which the pulmonary arteries dilate,
resulting in arterial deoxygenation (an increased alveolar￾arterial oxygen gradient [AaDO2] with or without hypox￾emia) [1]. Although not frequent, occasional reports of
portopulmonary hypertension (POPH), in which the pul￾monary arteries thicken, resulting in pulmonary hyperten￾sion (PH), have been described. The criteria for
diagnosing POPH are PH (defined by a mean pulmonary
artery pressure [mPAP] > 25 mmHg at rest via right heart
catheterization) and high pulmonary vascular resistance
without complicating left heart failure. These criteria indi￾cate that POPH is a form of pulmonary hypertension not
due to left ventricular heart failure in portal hypertensive
patients. The prevalence of HPS in patients with cirrhosis
ranges from 10 to 30%, while that of POPH ranges from 5
to 10% [2]. Both of these complications significantly
worsen the prognosis and quality of life [3].
Given that HPS can be resolved after orthotopic liver
transplantation (OLT) even when hypoxemia is severe
(PaO2 < 50 mmHg), the implications for OLT are under￾stood to apply not only with deceased donor LT (DDLT)
but also living donor related LT (LDLT). However, the
post-OLT course of POPH-complicated patients is often
unsatisfactory, and severe (mPAP > 45 to 50 mmHg) pa￾tients are considered absolutely contraindicated for OLT.
The International Liver Transplant Society Practice
Guidelines indicate that, unlike HPS, there are no data to
support the concept that POPH (treated or untreated)
should be an indication for OLT [4]. Several clinical stud￾ies have suggested that if mPAP is < 35 mmHg, then the
perioperative mortality does not increase [5, 6]. Further￾more, the Practice Guidelines recommend that patients
with mPAP < 35 mmHg be indicated for OLT, and PA￾targeted therapy should be initiated in patients with mPAP
≥35 mmHg [4]. However, almost all of the patients in
these articles had received DDLT, and no such analyses
have been performed for LDLT patients. Given that left or
right lobe LDLT grafts are smaller than DDLT grafts, PH￾induced hepatic venous pressure might result in a strong
congestive impact on the LDLT grafted liver.
The objective of the present study was to investigate
the impact of cirrhosis-related cardio-pulmonary com￾plications on the LDLT survival. Although patients with
confirmed POPH and HPS are rare, those with mild pul￾monary hypertension and mild HPS are more common.
Given that right heart catheterization is not performed
for all patients during the pre-operative investigation,
the tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG)
measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was
adopted to estimate the PH-related congestive pressure
in the transplanted liver. The peak systolic pressure gra￾dient between the right ventricle (RV) and the right
atrium (RA) can be estimated using the peak systolic
TRPG [7]. The TRPG is calculated from the peak vel￾ocity of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) measured by
continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography using the
modified Bernoulli equation [8].
The risk factors associated with the 3-month, 1-year,
and 40-month survival were investigated.
Methods
Subjects
The study group consisted of 84 retrospectively analyzed
liver cirrhosis patients who received LDLT at our hos￾pital (Table 1). All patients were recruited at the Clinic
of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Okayama Univer￾sity Hospital, from December 2008 to September 2015,
indicating that all patients were followed for longer than
1 year. Definitely diagnosed HPS before OLT was noted
in only one patient, and POPH before OLT was also
noted in only one patient. The definitively diagnosed
POPH patients received specific treatment with prosta￾glandin I2 and showed a normal range of TRPG and
mPAP at LDLT.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient in￾cluded in the study, and the study protocol conformed
to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of
Helsinki as reflected in the approval by the ethics com￾mittee at Okayama University Hospital. After obtaining
the patients’ written informed consent, a detailed med￾ical questionnaire was completed by the doctors.
Definitions of subclinical HPS and a subclinical high TRPG
All of the patients underwent an arterial blood gas ana￾lysis and TTE before OLT as pre-operative screening.
The patients were classified as having subclinical HPS
when they exhibited elevated AaDO2 levels (> 15 mmHg)
and decreased PaO2 levels (< 80 mmHg) according to
the definition by a European Respiratory Society task
force [9]. If a patient exhibited subclinical HPS, perfu￾sion lung scanning using technetium-99 m-labeled mac￾roaggregated albumin ([99 m]Tc-MAA) scintigraphy was
performed to diagnose definite HPS. There was only one
patient who exhibited definite HPS. The patients were
classified as having a subclinical high TRPG when they
exhibited a relatively elevated TRPG of ≥25 mmHg ac￾cording to the median TRPG levels before LDLT. The
TRPG data were available from 76 patients. If a patient
exhibited a subclinical high TRPG, the peak TR velocity
was assessed to select the patients requiring further ex￾aminations according to the 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines
for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hyperten￾sion [7]. There was only one patient who exhibited def￾inite POPH requiring anti-PH treatment.

We performed Swan-Ganz catheterization just before the
operation after administering general anesthesia for OLT to
determine the mPAP. Although mPAP> 25 mmHg could
be diagnosed with definite POPH, the mPAP obtained in
the present study was performed under 60% O2 with mech￾anical ventilation and was likely affected by this condition.
We used these advisory mPAP data, namely mPAP-FIO20.
6, to identify subclinical high TRPG patients in detail.
Post-OLT management of the subjects
Post-OLT, the patients were treated with a standard im￾munosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus or cyclosporine A
with steroids and/or mycophenolate mofetil). Patients
with hepatitis C recurrence were treated with interferon￾containing regimens, except for five recently trans￾planted patients who received direct anti-viral agents.
Statistical analyses
The JMP software program (Version 13.0.0; SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to conduct the statistical
analyses. Continuous variables were expressed as the me￾dian (interquartile range), and the Mann-Whitney U-test or
chi-squared test was used to compare the parameters be￾tween patients with subclinical HPS and subclinical non￾HPS or patients with a subclinical high TRPG and subclin￾ical non-high TRPG. A univariate analysis to define the fac￾tors affecting the survival was performed by a log-rank test.
The factors found to be significant according to a univariate
analysis and the widely accepted post-OLT survival-related
factor ‘MELD score’ were used in the multivariate Cox re￾gression analysis. The correlations between the TRPG and
mPAP were analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation
method. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. The four
subgroups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test
or chi-squared test with Bonferroni’s correction.
Results
General characteristics of subclinical HPS and subclinical
high TRPG
The baseline liver diseases were 43 hepatitis C virus
(HCV)-related cirrhosis, 7 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-
related cirrhosis, 13 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), and 21 other etiologies. Twenty-nine patients
(34.1%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Table 1).
The median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)
score was 16, reflecting decompensated liver cirrhosis.
The subclinical HPS patients exhibited no marked clinical
differences from the no-HPS patients. However, the sub￾clinical high TRPG patients had a higher MELD score
than the low/normal-TRPG patients (p = 0.033), indicating
a more severe condition of cirrhosis. TTE revealed right
ventricular dilatation more frequently in subclinical high
TRPG patients than in other patients (p = 0.022).
TRPG and mPAP-FIO20.6
The TRPG levels observed by TTE and mPAP-FIO20.6
levels observed by Swan-Ganz catheterization were not
significantly correlated in our study, although they are
widely accepted as correlated (Fig. 1). To determine the
reason for this discrepancy, the clinical characteristics
were investigated according to the TRPG and mPAP￾FIO20.6 value (Table 2). Patients with a low/normal￾TRPG and low mPAP-FIO20.6 (Group 4; n = 34) were

most frequently identified, exhibiting the lowest MELD
score among the groups examined, as expected. Patients
with a high TRPG and high-mPAP-FIO20.6 (Group 1; n
= 8) with clinically definite PH tended to have a high
MELD score (p = 0.006 vs Group 4). Patients with a high
TRPG and low mPAP-FIO20.6 (Group 2; n = 25) did not
show right heart dilatation. Patients with a low/normal￾TRPG and high mPAP-FIO20.6 (Group 3; n = 7) had the
highest rate of positive subclinical HPS (p = 0.003 vs
Group 4), suggesting that the high congestive pressure
might be decreased via right-to-left pulmonary shunting.
Post-LDLT three-month and one-year survival-related factors
The pre- and peri-operative risk factors that correlated
with the short-term (three-month and one-year) survival
are shown in Table 3. A subclinical high TRPG was the
only factor found to be correlated with the three-month
survival (p = 0.004). A higher donor age and MELD
score and a subclinical high TRPG were significantly
correlated with the one-year survival. However, a multi￾variate analysis revealed a subclinical high TRPG to be the
only significant factor (p = 0.003). The standard cardiac
function as reflected by the ejection fraction was not cor￾related with the survival or post-LDLT renal function.
Post-LDLT 40-month survival-related factors
The pre- and peri-operative risk factors that correlated
with the 40-month survival are shown in Table 3. A
higher donor age and MELD score and a subclinical
high TRPG were significantly correlated with the 40-
month survival after OLT. A multivariate analysis re￾vealed a higher donor age and a subclinical high TRPG
to be significant factors (p = 0.008 and 0.012 respect￾ively). The survival rate according to the subclinical high
TRPG status is shown in Fig. 2. Subclinical high TRPG
patients exhibited both a worse early as well as long￾term survival after LDLT than the others (p = 0.002).
The standard cardiac function as reflected by the ejec￾tion fraction was not correlated with the survival or
post-LDLT renal function, as in the short-term analysis.
The post-LDLT survival according to TRPG and mPAP￾FIO20.6 status
Given that a high TRPG but not a high mPAP-FIO20.6
was a significant risk factor for the post-LDLT survival,
the post-LDLT survival was investigated according to the
TRPG and mPAP-FIO20.6 status in Table 2 (Fig. 3). The
post-LDLT survival was worst in Group 2, which had a
high TRPG and low mPAP-FIO20.6, while a high mPAP
was not found to be a significant risk factor in the
present study, despite it being widely accepted as such
(p < 0.001). Group 3 patients with a high mPAP-FIO20.6
and low TRPG showed a good survival, probably be￾cause co-existing HPS released the regurgitation
pressure.
Causes of death in those with a subclinical high TRPG
The causes of death were not significantly different be￾tween groups, but the rate of recurrence of HCV was
lower in the subclinical high TRPG patients than in the
non-subclinical high TRPG patients (2/10 vs. 2/4)
(Table 4). Four deaths were recorded in patients without
a subclinical high TRPG, including two with HCV￾related hepatitis recurrence. Among the patients with
subclinical high TRPG, three deaths due to infection,
two due to vascular thrombus and HCV recurrence, and
one due to small-for-size graft syndrome (graft recipient
weight ratio; 0.55%) and primary non-functioning of the
graft were recorded. These factors other than HCV re￾currence may be associated with congestion of the
grafted liver.

Discussion
In the present study, a high TRPG was a definite survival￾defining factor after LDLT that might be able to be con￾trolled before or during operation. Even in patients with a
high mPAP-FIO20.6, the co-existence of subclinical HPS
might reduce the TRPG, thus resulting in a good progno￾sis. The TRPG but not mPAP-FIO20.6 was a critical factor
that may reflect the pressure directed to the grafted small
living-donor liver. Given that this study was retrospective
and the sample size was relatively small, larger prospective
studies to confirm the present results are needed.
Reported factors associated with a worse survival after
primary DDLT include a high MELD score, HCV posi￾tivity, aged recipient, aged donor [10], mechanical venti￾lation before OLT, and dialysis [11]. Although the present
data did not include the hepatic venous pressure gradient
(HVPG), which is an accurate reflection of the portal pres￾sure gradient, we included the Child-Pugh score, MELD
score and the history of variceal treatment to assess the
severity of cirrhosis. As survival-related factors after
LDLT, small-for-size graft syndrome is an additional im￾portant factor [12]. The present investigation indicated
that a pre-LDLT subclinical high TRPG was an
independent strong survival-determining factor after
LDLT. Although not all patients with a subclinical high
TRPG exhibited PH, congestive pressure to the grafted
liver likely affected the small living donor graft function
recovery post-LDLT.
In LDLT settings, graft blood flow in the initial few
weeks after surgery has been reported to influence the

overall outcome of small-for-size liver graft OLT. Poor
venous outflow and resulting hepatic congestion have
been shown to be strong factors for a poor graft function
[13]. Several vascular surgical techniques to reduce hep￾atic venous congestion have been adopted to improve
the living donor graft survival [14, 15]. These findings
indicate that hepatic venous congestion and the resulting
graft congestion are relatively frequent prognosis￾defining factors in LDLT, although such congestion is
not usually severely problematic in DDLT. The present
results suggested that a high mPAP measured after gen￾eral anesthesia did not affect the outcome post-LDLT;
however, a subclinical high TRPG measured by TTE
proved to be a strong predictor of a bad outcome. The
most frequent causes of deaths in the subclinical high
TRPG patients were infection and secondly vascular
thrombus. Bacterial translocation from the intestine
could be induced by pressure at the graft portal tract
resulting in severe infection, and vascular thrombus
could also be induced by pressure at the graft. These fre￾quent causes of death in the subclinical high TRPG pa￾tients all involved, albeit indirectly, high pressure being
applied to the grafts.
TRPG measured by TTE is usually positively correlated
with mPAP measured by right heart catheterization [16].
However, several reports have published findings denying
such a correlation [17, 18]. One analysis reported that
over- and underestimation occurred equally frequently
with TTE [19]. Another report stated that TTE underesti￾mated PH more often than catheterization, especially in
patients with RV enlargement or right heart failure [20].
However, a different report claimed that severe TR could
induce altered right heart hemodynamics, resulting in
the overestimation of PH [21]. These conflicting findings
are partly because TRPG measures the indirect periph￾eral pulmonary arterial pressure to the right ventricle
and right atrium, while mPAP measures the micro￾vessel-level central pulmonary arterial pressure. Our
present results indicated no significant correlation be￾tween mPAP-FIO20.6 and TRPG. Given that O2 adminis￾tration is an accepted supportive therapy for PH, the
present mPAP-FIO20.6 may be lower than the mPAP
measured by standard right heart catheterization used as
a diagnostic marker for PH. Although the present mPAP￾FIO20.6 is different from the mPAP measured by the
standard method, all of our patients were in a similar
medical condition, and therefore the investigation of the
correlation in this population was deemed acceptable.
The difference between standard mPAP and mPAP￾FIO20.6 cannot be determined. The clinical impact of

these values on the post-LDLT survival also differed, as a
higher TRPG was significantly correlated with the out￾come, while a higher mPAP-FIO20.6 was not. The pa￾tients included in our present study exhibited a relatively
large left atrium with high AaDO2 compared with the
normal range observed in the Japanese population, indi￾cating right-to-left shunt predominance with subclinical
HPS. The co-existence of subclinical HPS was particu￾larly predominant in Group 3, indicating that TRPG is
not high even when mPAP is high. The pressure against
the grafted liver is reflected by the TRPG, not by the
mPAP, as the pressure may be reduced due to pulmonary
arterial bypass with HPS. Given the small sample size, es￾pecially in Group 1 and 3, larger studies are needed to
confirm this possibility.
HPS is more frequently found than POPH and has
been acknowledged as a life-threatening complication;
however, this condition can be resolved with OLT [22].
The pathophysiology of this condition is considered to
be pulmonary vessel dilatation due to the easily identi￾fied vascular dilation-related hormonal changes in liver
cirrhosis [1]. As we did not perform TTE with a bubble
study, which is the standard sensitive imaging test for
identifying intra-pulmonary vascular shunting, we diag￾nosed only one definite HPS patient by lung perfusion
scintigraphy. However, the subclinical HPS patients who
clinically exhibited HPS phenomena accounted for 33%
of the included subjects. This subclinical HPS condition
is frequently accompanied by end-stage liver disease. In
our present analysis, the Group 3 patients with a rela￾tively high mPAP and a low TRPG exhibited a higher
frequency of subclinical HPS than the other groups. The
definite POPH with definite HPS combination has been
reported to be associated with a poor 1-year survival rate
of 68%, while POPH alone is associated with a 91% sur￾vival rate excluding OLT recipients [23]. The post-OLT
survival was worse in POPH patients with HPS (5 of 5
dead) than in patients with POPH alone (3 of 3 alive).
However, our present results concerning the post-LDLT
survival indicated the opposite effect. These patients
may not be very sick, as they exhibited only “subclinical”
high TRPG and HPS. They may therefore be in good
enough health to benefit from HPS, although their
mPAP-FIO20.6 values were high. Under these condi￾tions, regurgitation pressure from the pulmonary artery
might escape via an intra-pulmonary shunt.
The cardio-pulmonary clinical condition of Group 2,
who had a high TRPG and low mPAP, was associated
with the worst outcome of the examined groups. This
condition is similar to left-to-right shunting or right
heart failure although not clinically evident. In addition,
the Group 2 patients exhibited a lower frequency of RA
dilatation than those in Group 1, showing a high TR
pressure without RA dilatation, which indicated a strong
pressure directed to the grafted liver. RA dilatation may
relieve the direct pressure to the graft.
Conclusion
TRPG as assessed by TTE may be more useful than
mPAP by pre-operational right heart catheterization
under FIO20.6 for predicting the post-OLT survival. A
high TRPG, even below the limit of PH, may reflect
pressure to the grafted liver that might be critical for
relatively small-for-size LDLT. Given that this study was
retrospective and the sample size was relatively small,
larger prospective studies to confirm the present results
are needed. When patients with a high TRPG undergo
LDLT, the administration of therapies to reduce the
TRPG should be considered.
