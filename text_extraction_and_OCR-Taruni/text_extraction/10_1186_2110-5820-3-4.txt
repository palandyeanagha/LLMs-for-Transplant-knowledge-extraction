albumin

Abstract
Human serum albumin (HSA) has been used for a long time as a resuscitation fluid in critically ill patients. It is
known to exert several important physiological and pharmacological functions. Among them, the antioxidant
properties seem to be of paramount importance as they may be implied in the potential beneficial effects that
have been observed in the critical care and hepatological settings. The specific antioxidant functions of the protein
are closely related to its structure. Indeed, they are due to its multiple ligand-binding capacities and free radical￾trapping properties. The HSA molecule can undergo various structural changes modifying its conformation and
hence its binding properties and redox state. Such chemical modifications can occur during bioprocesses and
storage conditions of the commercial HSA solutions, resulting in heterogeneous solutions for infusion. In this
review, we explore the mechanisms that are responsible for the specific antioxidant properties of HSA in its native
form, chemically modified forms, and commercial formulations. To conclude, we discuss the implication of this
recent literature for future clinical trials using albumin as a drug and for elucidating the effects of HSA infusion in
critically ill patients.

Review
Introduction
Clinically, Human Serum Albumin (HSA) is used for the
restoration of blood volume, emergency treatment of
shock, acute management of burns, and other situations
associated with hypovolemia [1]. Many studies have fo￾cused on the use of albumin as a resuscitation fluid and
its effects on patient outcomes in Intensive Care Units
(ICU). Some of them have revealed that use of either al￾bumin or normal saline for resuscitation fluid results in
similar outcomes [2]. Others have shown negative impacts:
for example, in a prospective cohort study, hyperoncotic
albumin infusion was associated with harmful effects on
renal function and outcome [3]. Conversely, other studies
have demonstrated positive effects or beneficial trends of
albumin infusion [4]. In a large controlled, randomized
trial, the administration of albumin may have decreased
the risk of death in patients with severe sepsis compared
with saline [5]. Furthermore, a randomized, controlled
trial in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis has shown that the addition of an albumin
infusion to an antibiotic treatment significantly reduced
the incidence of renal impairment and death [6]. The
several meta-analyses assessing the effectiveness of albu￾min solutions for resuscitation in critically i1l patients
failed to clarify this issue [7-10]. In this context, the choice
of a resuscitation fluid in ICU patients is still a conflicting
matter under debate, and it is not the scope of the present
review to provide an answer to this issue. Our objective is
rather to highlight the mechanisms by which albumin
might exert its potential beneficial effects in the critical
care and hepatological settings.
Among the hypotheses that have been proposed to ex￾plain the positive effects of albumin, its antioxidant pro￾perties seem to be of paramount importance [11-14]. This
hypothesis is supported by the central role of oxidative
stress in critical pathologies, such as sepsis or liver failure
[1,15]. Indeed, the pathophysiology of sepsis may be
characterized by the negative role of free radicals during
the onset, progression, and outcome of sepsis [16,17].

partially, through endothelial dysfunction with
alterations of vascular tone, increased cell adhesion, and
vascular permeability [18,19]. The activation of endo￾thelial cells contributes to maintain the oxidant-rich en￾vironment at the inflammatory locus [20]. Moreover,
high levels of ROS and RNS can result in organ damages
[21], the ROS amount being related to the severity of
sepsis and mortality [20]. In the same way, oxidative
stress is very high in cirrhotic patients and plays an im￾portant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms
involved in the hemodynamic disturbances observed
[16,22]. Indeed, excessive systemic Nitric Oxide (NO) pro￾duction is involved in peripheral vasoplegia, which induces
portal hypertension, an important complication of cir￾rhosis [23]. The detrimental role of oxidative stress
occurs during both the onset of hepatic alterations and
during progression stages of the disease, in correlation
with the severity of cirrhosis [24].
The detrimental role of oxidative damage in critical
pathologies, added to the demonstration of potential
positive effects of albumin infusion in these patients,
constitute a strong rationale that justifies for addressing
the specific antioxidant capacities of HSA [11-14]. Our
review summarizes the state of the art on this topic and
focuses on the antioxidant properties of HSA related to
(i) first its native form, (ii) the chemically modified-HSA
(iii) the commercial HSA. The implication of this recent
literature for future clinical trials using albumin as a
drug is finally discussed.
Specific antioxidant capacities of native HSA
Albumin is a non-glycosylated protein of 66 kDa [25,26];
its normal plasma concentration is between 35 and 50 g/l
constituting up to 60% of total plasma proteins [27]. Its
half-life is ~ 20 days in normal conditions. The HSA struc￾ture consists of a single-chain polypeptide of 585 amino
acid residues and approximately 67% alpha-helix and no
beta-sheet [28,29]. Native HSA contains 6 methionines
and 35 cysteine residues involved in the formation of
17 disulfide bonds. The Cys-34 residue is the only free
cysteine in the whole molecule. HSA exerts specific
antioxidant functions due to its multiple ligand-binding
capacities and free radical-trapping properties, both closely
related to its structure [16,29].
HSA antioxidant properties related to ligand-binding
capacities
HSA is well known for binding a large variety of molecules,
including fatty acids, drugs, hormones, and metal ions [27].
The main ligands of HSA implied in direct or indirect anti￾oxidant functions of the protein are transition metal ions
(copper and iron essentially) [15]. The high affinity site
for Cu(II) ions is composed of the first four amino acids
Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK) from the N-terminus of HSA
[30,31]. Free redox-active transition metal ions (Cu(II) and
Fe(II)) can potentially be extremely pro-oxidant. Indeed,
through the Fenton reaction, they can interact with hydro￾gen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzing the formation of aggressive
ROS. The net result of the reaction sequence is known as
the Haber-Weiss reaction, showing that iron and copper
are the most important transition metals in human disease
and play a key role in the production of hydroxyl radicals
in vivo [30,32]. The binding of free transition metals to
proteins can control their reactivity and limit their availabi￾lity for the Fenton reaction [30,32]. HSA might then be able
to limit damage caused by hydroxyl radicals produced from
Fenton reaction between iron/copper and H2O2 [31].
Other aspects of the antioxidant activity of albumin
result from to its ability to bind bilirubin, homocysteine,
and lipids but are of minor importance compared with
metal ion involvement in HSA antioxidant properties.
HSA contains one high affinity site (Lys240) for biliru￾bin [33]. The resulting HSA-bound bilirubin acts as an
inhibitor of lipid peroxidation and thus represents an
indirect antioxidant property of HSA [34]. Another
aspect of HSA antioxidant properties is its capacity to
bind homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid resulting
from the catabolism of methionine residue [35]. Some
previous studies have suggested that the binding of HSA
to polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols could contrib￾ute to its antioxidant properties, by preventing lipid
peroxidation. Additional studies are necessary to docu￾ment this HSA protective capacity [36,37].
HSA antioxidant properties related to free radical-trapping
properties
Upon secretion in physiological conditions, one-third of
the HSA pool exists as disulfides mixed with cysteine,
homocysteine, or glutathione (GSH) (HSA-S-S-R) and
two-thirds of the HSA molecules exist in a reduced
form with a free thiol in the Cys-34 residue (HSA-SH),
known as human mercaptalbumin [37,38]. This redox
thiol group, in connection with the high concentration
of HSA in the circulation, accounts for 80% thiols in
plasma, constituting the major extracellular source of
reactive free thiol [16,25,39]. Working as a free radical
scavenger, the Cys34 residue is able to trap multiple ROS
and RNS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite
(ONOO-), superoxide, or hypochlorous acid (HOCl)
[15,16,40]. Under oxidative stress by peroxynitrite or
hydrogen peroxide, Cys34 thiol shifts to an exposed con￾formation and is oxidized itself resulting in sulfenic acid
(HSA-SOH) formation. HSA-SOH is a central intermedi￾ate in the redox modulation by reactive species. The final
outcome of the oxidative process depends on whether
the sulfenic acid is further oxidized, or whether it is
reduced leading to the initial HSA-SH. Sulfenic acid may
be oxidized to either sulfinic (HSA-SO2H) or sulfonic

(HSA-SO3H) acids, by usually irreversible processes leading
to end products [41,42]. Sulfenic acid also can be converted
into a disulfide (HSA-S-S-R), through reactions with low￾molecular-mass-thiol (RSH, glutathione or free cysteine)
allowing the return to the HSA-SH reduced form [37,43].
This HSA implication in disulfides formation supports a
relevant function of HSA-SH as an extracellular redox
regulator (Figure 1) [42]. HSA also could protect cells
against oxidative stress by modulating the cellular GSH
level. Indeed, catabolism of HSA could potentially represent
a source of sulfur-containing amino acids for cells in the
synthesis of thiol-containing molecules, such as GSH [44].
Under nitrosative stress by NO or other nitrosylating
agents, mercaptalbumin can be converted into nitroso￾HSA (HSA-S-NO) [37]. HSA-S-NO can transfer the
nitrosonium cation to low-molecular-mass-thiol RSH
(glutathione or free cysteine). The HSA-mediated catalysis
of RSH allows the return to the HSA-SH form and makes
the protein a major reservoir of NO (Figure 1) [37,45].
As cysteine amino acid, methionine also is a sulfur￾containing residue, representing an oxidation-sensitive
amino acid [46,47]. HSA contains six methionines residues
that can be oxidized, leading to methionine sulfoxide [48].
The two sulfur-containing residues in HSA, Met and
Cys, have then been proved to account for 40-80% of
the total antioxidant activity of the protein, which is res￾ponsible for more than 70% of the free radical-trapping
activity in serum [28,46,47]. In conclusion, HSA is
considered as the main extracellular molecule respon￾sible for maintaining the plasma redox state [11,37,49].
Impairments of specific antioxidant capacities of HSA
The various structural modifications that HSA can undergo
during its in vivo lifetime or during the processes employed
to isolate therapeutic HSA from plasma, modify not only
its conformation and hence its binding properties but also
its redox state [16,50,51]. Kawakami et al. have clearly
shown that reduced HSA and oxidized HSA have different
ligand-binding properties [50]. These authors also have
investigated the potential effect of oxidation on the antioxi￾dant capacity of HSA by comparing the radical scavenging
activities of HSA in various states of oxidation [50]. By
using electron spin resonance, they have observed that
the hydroxyl radical signal is reduced from 68.7% with
highly oxidized cysteinylated HSA (proportion of HSA
reduced = 8%) to 54.4% with non-oxidized HSA (propor￾tion of HSA reduced = 73%). They have then demonstrated
that the radical scavenging activity of reduced HSA is
greater than that of cysteinylated HSA [50]. Those results
are in accordance with other reports establishing that
oxidized HSA decreases scavenging ability against highly
ROS (hydroxyl radicals). Similarly, HSA nitrosylation leads
to a significant loss of its buffering capacity [52]. More￾over, the loss of aspartate-alanine from the N-terminus of
albumin completely abolishes the ability of albumin to
chelate free copper and is associated with the loss of its
free radical scavenging ability [52]. Finally, Iwao et al.
(2006) demonstrated that oxidation of several amino acids
of albumin had an impact on its pharmacokinetics by
decreasing its half-life [53].
Beyond oxidation and nitrosylation, HSA may undergo
other chemical modifications affecting its structure, which
is closely related to its specific antioxidant properties [27].
One of them is a non-enzymatic glycation consisting in
the attachment of free carbohydrate (glucose, galactose,
fructose...) on an amine residue leading to the formation
of a stable fructosamine residue [54]. Accumulation of nu￾merous studies has permitted to identify up to 29 sites
that can be glycated in vivo in the HSA [34]. Due to their
high nucleophile properties, lysine, arginine and cysteine
are the main residues prone to glycation and the two prin￾cipal sites are Arg410 and Lys525 [55,56]. Glycation￾induced modifications have an important impact on HSA
functional properties mainly related to alteration of its
conformation. These conformational changes affect HSA
binding properties because affinity of glycated HSA for
different ligands (long chain fatty acids, bilirubin, copper)
undergoes an important decrease [57]. Through, these
various processes, the antioxidant capacities of glycated
HSA are dramatically reduced [54,58,59].
In physiological conditions, due to the large amount
of HSA in plasma, impairments in the protein molecule
Figure 1 Scheme gives an overview of the steps leading to Cys-34 oxidation and thiolation (highlighted in red). Steps involved for the
nitrosylation of Cys-34 of human serum albumin (HSA) are highlighted in green. Formation of higher oxidation states of HSA is also shown. RSH,

and its antioxidant properties have been considered as
biologically insignificant [31]. However, antioxidant
properties of modified HSA may be related to patho￾logical conditions, in particular in septic and cirrhotic
conditions in which the decline of HSA plasma antioxi￾dant force also is mediated by the quantitative reduction
of the HSA concentration [16,20,28,60].
Specific antioxidant capacities of commercial HSA
The finding that HSA exerts a plasma antioxidant force
also is important regarding its possible therapeutic effects,
because it may provide the opportunity to enhance
endogenous antioxidant protection in pathological
conditions by HSA infusion [61]. Commercially availa￾ble HSA solutions are complex products that contain
not only native HSA but also various species of HSA
under different redox states, as well as several minor
degradation products [46,62]. Significant HSA variabil￾ity has been reported between the commercial HSA
solutions (Table 1). Bioprocesses and storage conditions
increase heterogeneity of HSA: truncated, cysteinylated,
nitrosylated, and glycosylated forms or HSA-HSA dimers
may be found in commercialized products [29]. These
frequently encountered modifications can change HSA
antioxidant properties and its binding capacity to
endogenous or exogenous molecules [29,51,63]. The
observed heterogeneity also can potentially influence
clinical outcome and should be correlated with morbi￾dity/mortality in randomized trials [47,63,64]. The use of
an antioxidant for the treatment of sepsis has been
considered a new, interesting, adjunctive therapy and
constitutes a challenge in the clinical management of these
patients [17]. However, it is still unclear whether the ad￾ministration of commercially available HSA that is largely
oxidized, increases or decreases oxidative stress burden in
critically ill patients [52].
Until now, several analytical techniques have been
employed to monitor the heterogeneity or the degradation
profiles of HSA. High-Performance Liquid Chromatogra￾phy (HPLC), Mass Spectrometry (MS), Sodium Dodecyl
Sulfate-PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and Western blot analyses, or Capillary Zone Electropho￾resis (CZE) have contributed to point out this heterogen￾eity of commercial HSA [51,62]. Aggregation or chemical
degradation can be induced during sample preparation
or purification. Procedures, such as temperature varia￾tions, freeze-thawing process, mechanical agitation, or
lyophilization, may affect HSA structure and compos￾ition of therapeutic HSA. Anraku et al. studied the pro￾tective effect of sodium N-acetyl-L-tryptophanate
against albumin oxidation, using HPLC. They partially
resolved mercaptalbumin (reduced form of HSA) from
two populations of non-mercaptalbumin (oxidized
forms), demonstrating that it is possible to improve the
quality of the solutions [65]. Ogasawara et al. used SDS￾PAGE and Western blot analyses to detect albumin di￾sulfide dimers in plasma, considered to be a biomarker
of oxidative stress [66]. More recently, Qian et al.
(2008) reported a size exclusion HPLC method to esti￾mate the proportion of HSA dimers and oligomers

suitable for a quality control [67]. MS and MS coupled
to HPLC also have been employed to characterize dif￾ferent variants of HSA in commercial HSA preparations.
In particular, six related proteins have been identified but
the method provided only qualitative data and did not
detect any dimer form of HSA [52]. Finally, Alahmad
et al. developed a reproducible CZE method to separate
HSA from most of its variants. This method proved to
be useful in detecting quantitative differences in the
proportion of native HSA present in batches produced
according to different fractionation ways [51]. Because
an increased percentage of oxidized HSA is responsible
for impaired HSA functions [28], the development of a
reliable method providing qualitative and quantitative
data on HSA variants in commercial preparations, espe￾cially the ratio of native HSA to degraded forms, is of
paramount importance for optimizing the clinical use
of HSA.
Implications for further studies
As we have previously mentioned, studies using HSA as
a resuscitation fluid have shown conflicting results in
septic and cirrhotic conditions. The relative contribution
of resuscitation fluid capacity and antioxidant properties
should be further investigated because it may influence
the design of future trials. As a matter of fact, the ratio￾nale for infusing HSA was different in recent albumin
trials which may account for different results. Should we
rely on albuminemia and at what threshold: 30 g/l, or
specific plasma concentrations (e.g. thiols, markers of ROS
aggression)? The clinical studies have used different quan￾tities of HSA infusion and various commercial forms of
HSA. Regarding the HSA quality, it is well established that
significant variability exists between the different commer￾cial HSA solutions. They contain native HSA associated
with various species of HSA in different redox states. They
also contain several minor degradation products [47,63].
These modifications are known to change the antioxidant
capacities of HSA and may account for the observed het￾erogeneity in the results of clinical trials [29,46,51,63,64].
It would be interesting to conduct an analysis correla￾ting, for each clinical trial, the qualitative and quantita￾tive characteristics of HSA infusion with the observed
results in critically ill patients.
Moreover, the main characteristics of commercially
available HSA should be tested in vitro, because they
may differ from one product to another with different
in vivo effect. The elucidation of the composition of
commercialized HSA used in critically ill patients, with
particular attention to the oxidized forms of HSA, is of
great interest for the understanding of the observed vari￾ability in the results of clinical trials.
Finally, it is relevant to pursue the investigations
concerning HSA antioxidant functions in physiological
and pathophysiological conditions. Accumulative evidence
suggests that HSA may interfere with microcirculation
and endothelium function through an interaction with
glycocalyx and specific antioxidant properties [68]. As a
consequence, monitoring of endothelial function and
microcirculation may guide HSA administration and
contribute to the optimization of tissue perfusion in
septic shock. The preliminary results of the Albios trial
(presented orally at the ESICM meeting in Lisbon October
2012) suggest that HSA was effective in the subgroup of
patients with the most severe form of sepsis which is
septic shock. Future trials should probably focus on that
specific high-risk population [69].
Conclusions
It is well established that, among plasma antioxidants,
endogenous HSA is considered the main extracellular
molecule responsible for maintaining the plasma redox
state [16,29]. Its specific antioxidant functions are due to
its multiple ligand-binding capacities and free radical￾trapping properties and are closely related to the struc￾ture and the redox state of the molecule [16,29]. Some
clinical studies have revealed positive effects or beneficial
trends of HSA infusion [4,5]. Importantly, these trials have
been conducted in critical pathologies in which oxidative
stress plays a central detrimental role [1,15]. It seems rele￾vant to consider that the specific antioxidant properties
of the HSA molecule are involved in the positive thera￾peutic effects of HSA infusion, reported in the critical
care and hepatological setting. In this hypothesis, using
HSA as a resuscitation fluid could represent an oppor￾tunity to enhance endogenous antioxidant protection in
critical pathological conditions [1,61]. Because an increased
percentage of oxidized HSA is responsible for impaired HSA
functions [50], we propose that preference should be given
to preparations with a higher reduced HSA percentage.
