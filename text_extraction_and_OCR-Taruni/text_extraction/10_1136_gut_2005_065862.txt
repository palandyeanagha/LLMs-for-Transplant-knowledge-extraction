Background and aims: Study of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and the factors responsible for its
impairment in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has, to date, been limited. There is increasing need for a
HRQOL questionnaire which is specific to PBC. The aim of this study was to develop, validate, and evaluate
a patient based PBC specific HRQOL measure.
Subjects and methods: A pool of potential questions was derived from thematic analysis of indepth
interviews carried out with 30 PBC patients selected to represent demographically the PBC patient
population as a whole. This pool was systematically reduced, pretested, and cross validated with other
HRQOL measures in national surveys involving a total of 900 PBC patients, to produce a quality of life
profile measure, the PBC-40, consisting of 40 questions distributed across six domains. The PBC-40 was
then evaluated in a blinded comparison with other HRQOL measures in a further cohort of 40 PBC
patients.
Results: The six domains of PBC-40 relate to fatigue, emotional, social, and cognitive function, general
symptoms, and itch. The highest mean domain score was seen for fatigue and the lowest for itch. The
measure has been fully validated for use in PBC and shown to be scientifically sound. PBC patient
satisfaction, measured in terms of the extent to which a questionnaire addresses the problems that they
experience, was significantly higher for the PBC-40 than for other HRQOL measures.
Conclusion: The PBC-40 is a short easy to complete measure which is acceptable to PBC patients and has
significantly greater relevance to their problems than other frequently used HRQOL measures. Its scientific
soundness, shown in extensive testing, makes it a valuable instrument for future use in clinical and research
settings.
P
rimary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic
liver disease, which is progressive in a proportion of
patients resulting in end stage liver disease. There is an
increasing appreciation that the quality of life of PBC patients
is frequently impaired by symptoms and other associated
aspects of the disease. Typical symptoms include pruritus and
fatigue which can occur at any point in the disease course
and which may be independent of histological stage.1–3 The
effects of PBC on life quality have, however, been subjected to
only limited formal analysis, not least because of the
difficulties inherent in quantifying such subjective experi￾ences. Where such formal studies have been performed they
have tended to strongly confirm the view that this disease
has an often dramatic negative effect on quality of life.2 4–6
Reasonable conclusions that can be drawn from our current
state of knowledge are, therefore, that quality of life is
probably significantly impaired in a meaningful proportion of
PBC patients and that appreciation of the significance of this
quality of life impairment is critical if we are to fully
understand their experiences. A clear implication of these
conclusions is that study of the mechanisms responsible for
quality of life impairment, and the development of treat￾ments able to reverse these processes and improve quality of
life, are important research goals in their own right.
Critically, however, each of these issues (assessment of the
impact of quality of life impairment on patients, identifica￾tion of affected patients for studies of pathogenesis, and
assessment of quality of life improving treatments in clinical
trials) requires clinical tools which allow us to reliably,
relevantly, and sensitively measure quality of life impairment
in PBC patients.
The study of quality of life in PBC has conventionally been
performed using existing health related quality of life
(HRQOL) measures derived in other, often non-liver, chronic
diseases.2 4 7–12 The relevance and appropriateness of the
application of these generic tools for the assessment of
HRQOL to patients with PBC is, however, highly question￾able, particularly since extrapolation of their use clinically
has typically taken place with limited, if any, assessment
of their validity in the context of PBC.13 This is in addition
to the general concern about the appropriateness of the
application of generic HRQOL measures to patients with
chronic diseases.14–17 A further potential problem is that
quality of life measures developed and tested in one or two
treatment centres, or in a defined geographical area,2–4 10 12
may have relevance to only those specific situations.
These various limitations highlight the need for a robust
PBC specific measure through which a wide picture of
its impact on HRQOL can be documented. Such a measure
could be used in studies of the pathways responsible
for quality of life impairment and of their therapeutic
modification. The aim of this study was therefore to derive,
validate, and evaluate the use of a PBC specific HRQOL
measure.

METHODS
Study design
The study had three phases (see fig 1). In the first phase,
indepth interviews with patients were used to derive an
initial measure, which was then reduced in size and refined
following completion by a large patient cohort. In the second
phase, the resulting measure (the PBC-40) was refined and
validated in a further large patient survey. The aim of this
phase of the study was to evaluate the scientific soundness of
the new measure, as indicated by its psychometric properties
(that is, validity, reliability, precision, and acceptability to
patients—see below). In the third phase, the PBC-40 was
evaluated in PBC patients in comparison with previously
used HRQOL measures. The appropriateness of the patient
orientated approach adopted is widely recognised.18 19 Ethics
approval for the study was obtained from local research
ethics committees in participating centres. Data protection
requirements were observed throughout the study.
Participants
Participants taking part in indepth interviews and in the final
evaluation stage were recruited from outpatient clinics in two
secondary care centres in the North of England. All of these
patients had definite or probable PBC defined using
established diagnostic criteria (at least two of: (1) cholestatic
liver function tests, (2) compatible or diagnostic liver
histology, and (3) AMA at a titre of .1 in 80).20
Participants for the two postal surveys conducted were
recruited via the PBC Foundation, a national (UK-wide)
charitable organisation providing support and information to
people affected by PBC. Although it was not possible, for both
ethical and logistic reasons, to verify their diagnostic status
from clinical records, all postal survey participants were
required to confirm that they had been diagnosed with PBC.
A total of 985 PBC subjects participated in the different
phases of the study.
Derivation phase
Potential component questions for the PBC-40 were gener￾ated from indepth interviews with 30 patients (interview
stage 1), during which they were asked to describe the
various ways in which having PBC affected them and their
life quality. Following recognised sampling approaches for
qualitative research21 the 30 participants were selected for
initial indepth interviews using age and time of diagnosis as
sampling criteria. This cohort was therefore representative
demographically of the local PBC patient population as a
whole. Their accounts were thematically analysed to generate
a series of potential questions, using the NVIVO 1.0
qualitative data analysis package.22
The complete list of potential questions derived from the
indepth interviews then underwent a two step reduction
process. The first step, which consisted of multiple rounds of
editing performed by the authors, was used to discard
questions that were repetitious, ambiguous, contained
colloquial expressions or jargon, or which were deemed to
reflect an individual’s specific experience (question reduction
stage 1). The questions remaining after this initial editing
process were factored into related symptom/quality of life
theme areas (domains). The questions were framed as a
series of statements with prespecified response options (see
table 1), from which respondents were instructed to select
the option matching most closely their situation. Response
options for all questions were on a standard five point Likert
response scale23 ranging from least burden or problem (score
of 1) to greatest burden or problem (score of 5). A four week
time frame was used for symptom specific questions, while
responses to more general questions regarding social life and
employment were not given a time frame.
The questions were first assessed in a further round of
indepth ‘‘cognitive’’ interviews24 in 10 patients to ensure ease
of understanding (interview stage 2) and then distributed to
500 PBC patient members of the PBC Foundation (postal
stage 1). The results of this survey were used to guide the
second question reduction round (question reduction stage
2). Question reduction was performed using a previously
described established method25 (questions were retained at
this stage if the frequency of endorsement for each response
option was .5% and non-response for each question was
,5%). To avoid redundancy, questions were removed if the
correlation between any two was .0.8 (that is, they were
functioning as duplicates). The result of this process was a
draft HRQOL measure. A further final round of cognitive
interviews (using five patients with definite PBC) was used to
confirm the acceptability of the finalised wording of
questions and their related response options (interview stage
3) before proceeding to the refinement and validation phases
of the study.
Validation phase
The draft measure was validated against a battery of other
widely used HRQOL and related measures and finalised. A
further large group of PBC Foundation PBC patient members
were asked to complete the full measure battery (including
the PBC-40, the medical outcomes survey short form-36 (SF￾36)26 27 previously used in the study of, among others, liver
disease patients,5–8 10 12 and three questions assessing cogni￾tive function from another condition specific HRQOL
measure (epilepsy surgery inventory-55 (ESI-55)28), together
with 12 general questions regarding perception of their
health status and quality of life (including impact of the
disease on work) and information regarding their disease
diagnosis (postal stage 2). A subgroup of patients participat￾ing in postal stage 2 were also asked to complete the measure
on a second occasion two weeks after completing it for the
first time to assess reproducibility. Where there were ,50%

missing values for questions in each domain, we adopted a
method advocated by McHorney and colleagues25 for imput￾ing mean values by adding the person specific mean for
remaining question values within the domain. Where there
were .50% missing values, domain responses were recorded
as missing data.
The principal aim of the validation phase of the study was
to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure
against established criteria.13 29 The criteria specifically
addressed were acceptability to patients, reliability (that is,
that a measure is reproducible and internally consistent),
validity (that is, that a measure measures what it purports to
measure), and precision (that is, the ability of a measure to
reflect true differences). Of the other recommended cri￾teria,13 29 appropriateness was inbuilt given that the ques￾tionnaire was developed exclusively in PBC patients; while
responsiveness (that is, the ability of a measure to detect
change over time) could not be tested as a result of the study
design and the lack of any accepted therapies other than
transplantation able to improve quality of life, against which
the responsiveness could be appropriately assessed.
Acceptability was determined through pretesting the mea￾sure in cognitive interviews with PBC patients in terms of
wording of questions and their related response options, and
by the length of time taken to complete the measure.
Response rates to the overall measure and to individual
questions also provided an indication of the measure’s
acceptability.
Reliability was established through examining internal
consistency or homogeneity of the questions in each domain
using Cronbach’s a coefficient*.
30 An a of at least 0.70 is
considered necessary for a scale to be deemed internally
consistent; although an a of 0.85 is considered optimal.31
Correlations between individual question and total domain
scores were examined as a further measure of internal
consistency reliability.32 It has been proposed by McHorney
and colleagues25 that a correlation .0.4 is acceptable for the
purpose of establishing scale reliability. Test-retest reliability
was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICCs). Coefficients of .0.9 are considered acceptable for
individual comparisons while scores between 0.5 and 0.7 are
adequate for group comparisons.25 33 We used a two week
interval between assessments, which is generally considered
to be a suitable time frame.34
Validity was examined in three respects, relating to (a) face
validity (ensuring that the instrument was measuring what it
was supposed to measure), (b) content validity (ensuring
that the instrument contained sufficient questions to
adequately assess HRQOL in PBC), and (c) construct validity
(ensuring that the measure correlated in a predicted way
with other measures in the test battery). Face and content
validity were established by ensuring that the patient
generated questions contained in the PBC-40 addressed
dimensions of HRQOL in PBC that were important and
relevant to patients themselves. Construct validity was
established by examining correlations of the PBC-40 with
the cognition questions from two other well recognised
HRQOL measures (SF-36 and ESI-55), using Pearson
correlation coefficients. We predicted a low to moderate
correlation between the social domain of the PBC-40 (10
questions) and the social function domain of the SF-36 (two
questions) due to differences in the number of questions
between the two scales and the contrast in recall parameters
for the PBC-40 (general) and the SF-36 (responses limited to
the last four weeks). We predicted moderate to high
correlations between the fatigue domain of the PBC-40 and
the vitality/energy domain of the SF-36; a moderate to high
correlation between the emotional domain of the PBC-40 and
the role emotional and mental health domains of the SF-36; a
high correlation between the cognitive domain of the PBC-40
and the cognition questions of the ESI-55; and a moderate to
high correlation between the symptoms and itch domains of
the PBC-40 and the physical domains of the SF-36.
Associations between the PBC-40 domain scores and the 12
general questions relating to global quality of life, employ￾ment, and health status were also examined.
Precision of the measure was established by examining
score distributions for floor or ceiling effects. A floor effect
occurs where respondents are frequently scoring at the
bottom of the scale (low degree of HRQOL impairment) with
the effect that subsequent improvement (that is, following
therapeutic intervention) cannot be measured. A ceiling
effect represents the converse situation where respondents
are scoring at the top of the scale (high degree of HRQOL
impairment) with the effect that subsequent deterioration in
HRQOL cannot be detected.
Evaluation phase
In order to evaluate the scope and relevance of the PBC-40 as
a clinical tool in comparison with other quality of life and
symptom assessment tools previously used in PBC, a further
group of 40 patients (all with definite PBC) who had not
participated in its derivation was given anonymised versions
of the SF-36,26 27 PBC-40, fatigue impact scale (FIS),9 and
chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ)10 to complete. The
measures were arranged in random sequence to avoid
potential questionnaire order effects. Participants were asked
to score each measure in response to the question ‘‘How well
does this questionnaire address the problems you have
encountered as a result of having PBC?’’ Responses were on
an integral scale of 1 to 10 with the label 1 representing ‘‘not
at all’’ and 10 representing ‘‘very well’’. Individual satisfac￾tion scores for each measure were compared using one way
ANOVA. Frequencies with which respondents identified each
measure as that which most accurately addressed their
problems, and with which respondents identified a measure
as addressing their problems poorly (defined as a response
score ,5) were compared by x2 test.
RESULTS
Derivation and validation of the PBC-40
The 30 initial indepth interviews (interview stage 1)
generated 2498 respondent statements of potential use as
HRQOL measure questions. A total of 2317 of these potential
questions were discarded in the initial reduction process
(question reduction stage 1). The remaining 180 questions
were pretested in cognitive interviews with 10 patients
(interview stage 2). Thirty nine questions were abandoned
after these interviews because patients felt they were
ambiguous, unclear, or difficult to answer. The remaining
141 questions were then tested in a national postal survey
(postal stage 1).
Of the 500 questionnaires sent out to PBC Foundation
members self-reporting a diagnosis of PBC, 378 (75%) were
returned. Of these 336 were usable in the study (the other 42
patients had either received liver transplants, had died (and
the questionnaires were returned blank by relatives), or had
already been involved in earlier phases of the study). Mean
age of respondents in this postal survey was 59 (10) years
with 312 (93%) females, 20 (5%) males, and no gender data
for four patients. Following this survey, 84/141 questions
* Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is a measure of the relatedness of items
(questions) in a multi-item scale. High alpha coefficients indicate high
relatedness (that is, internal consistency) of the items. To examine their
contribution to the scale in question, items are systematically removed
one at a time. If their removal leads to an increase in the alpha
coefficient (that is, improved internal consistency), items are then
discarded.

were abandoned through principal components analysis
(question reduction stage 2). Following comments returned
in the postal survey, appropriate alterations were also made
to the wording of some of the remaining questions and to the
format of response options (for example, agree/disagree
options were replaced with never/always options, which
respondents found to be a more appropriate form of
response). A second round of cognitive interviews with five
patients tested the reworded questions for acceptability
(interview stage 3). The remaining 57 questions were then
combined with the SF-36, three cognition questions from the
ESI-55, and the 12 general questions to form a test battery for
validation in a second national postal survey (postal stage 2).
In this second postal survey, 260/400 patients (65%)
returned survey questionnaires. Of these 240 were usable.
Mean age of respondents was 60 (10) years with 223 (92%)
females, 12 (5%) males, and no gender data for five patients.
Of the 400 subjects invited to participate in the second postal
survey, 100 were asked to complete a further questionnaire
two weeks later to allow test/retest reliability testing. Of these
100 test/retest subjects, 89 returned questionnaires, all of
which were useable. Mean age of the retest group was 62
(10) years with 94% female and 6% male. Based on responses
to the second postal survey, three questions relating to
employment were abandoned because the level of overall
endorsement for each was ,5%. Principal component
analysis performed on the remaining 54 questions identified
a 10 factor structure from which a further 16 were discarded
because they loaded on two or more factors. Two of these
questions (‘‘I had aches in the long bones of my arms and
legs’’ and ‘‘Having PBC gets me down’’) were later
reintroduced on the grounds of content validity. The final
version of the measure thus consisted of 40 questions, each
scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 = least impact,
5 = greatest impact) grouped into six domains (symptoms,
itch, fatigue, cognition, social, and emotional) (table 1). For

with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life.
Assessment of the psychometric properties of the PBC￾40
The potential usefulness of any HRQOL measure is deter￾mined by its psychometric properties.13 We therefore went on
to assess the psychometric properties of the finalised PBC-40
using the data from postal stage 2 (260 patients, 89 with test￾retest completion) and from the cognitive interviews.
Appropriateness
Developing the measure solely with a PBC population
ensured its appropriateness and relevance for this patient
group. Questions were based on what patients said in indepth
interviews, and further testing in cognitive interviews
ensured that both questions and response options were
appropriate for the final measure.
Acceptability
The average 10–20 minute completion time of the PBC-40 in
cognitive interviews was found to be acceptable to respon￾dents. Overall response rates were .65% for each phase of
the study, a rate considered acceptable for postal surveys.35
The validation survey showed 45/240 cases with missing
values, and of these only four had missing values .50%
(where it appeared that respondents had turned over two
pages of the questionnaire together). The low range of
missing values for the test battery (PBC-40 0.4%–4.2%; SF-36
0.4%–2.9%; ESI-55 0.8%) also indicated good acceptability to
respondents.
Reliability
Cronbach’s a scores in this sample ranged from 0.72 to 0.95
and so exceeded the standard recommended for group
comparison on all six domains (table 2). Three of the
domains (fatigue, cognitive, and itch) met the recommended
minimum of 0.9 for individual patient comparisons. ICC
scores ranged from 0.83 to 0.96. Question total correlations
were acceptable in all but two domains. In the social domain,
the correlation for the question ‘‘I tend to keep the fact that I
have PBC to myself’’ was only 0.19, while the symptoms
domain question ‘‘I felt unwell when I drank alcohol’’ had a
correlation of only 0.22. The low correlations for these two
particular questions reflects the fact that they had originally
been identified in factors 7–10 of the principal components
analysis but had been placed with other similar questions in
the social and other symptoms domains for reasons of face
validity.
Validity
Developing and pretesting the PBC-40 with patients them￾selves established face and content validity. Construct
validity of the PBC-40 was demonstrated by the high
correlations seen with the SF-36 and ESI-55 cognition
questions (table 3). Correlation between the social domain
of the PBC-40 and the social function domain of the SF-36
was higher than anticipated given the differences in question
number between the scales and the different recall param￾eters for the PBC-40 and SF-36. The predicted moderate to
high correlation between the fatigue domain of the PBC-40
and the vitality/energy domain of the SF-36 was confirmed.
Similarly, the moderate to high correlations between the
emotional domain of the PBC-40 and the role emotional and
mental health domains of the SF-36 were as predicted. High
correlation between the cognitive domain of the PBC-40 and
the cognition questions of the ESI-55 was also as predicted.
Precision
There were no significant ceiling effects but a moderate floor
effect was found for the itch domain (36.7%). The extent of
floor and ceiling effects is shown in table 4, together with the
range of actual domain scores, mean domain scores, and
standard deviations.

establishing scale reliability).25 Test-retest reliability was calculated using
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Coefficients of .0.9 are
considered acceptable for individual comparisons while scores between
0.5 and 0.7 are adequate for group comparisons.25 33 A standard two
week interval between assessments was used.34

In the 260 PBC patients participating in postal stage 2, no
significant correlations were seen between any PBC-40
domain score and age, self reported disease stage, length of
time since diagnosis, or sex (data not shown). The general
question that asked ‘‘Did you have to give up work because of
PBC’’ was, however, significantly associated with all domain
scores (p,0.001 for all domains; data not shown). In these
260 patients the fatigue domain was found to have the
highest mean score and the itch domain the lowest (fig 2).
Evaluation of the PBC-40
Of the 40 patients participating in the evaluation phase of the
study, 35 returned fully completed questionnaires (88%,
mean age 62 (11) years; 32 females, three males). Mean
satisfaction score was significantly higher for the PBC-40
than for the other measures (p,0.0005, one way ANOVA).
The PBC 40 was ranked highest (or equal highest) of the
measures with regard to the extent to which it addressed
their problems by significantly more of the patients (83%)
than any of the other measures (fig 3A). Conversely, the
percentage of patients rating the PBC-40 as unsatisfactory
(defined as a satisfactions score of less than 5) was
significantly lower (3%) than for any of the other measures
(fig 3B). No relationship was seen between patient age and
degree of satisfaction for any of the measures.
DISCUSSION
We have developed a brief psychometrically robust measure
of HRQOL, the PBC-40, intended specifically for use with
patients with PBC. The measure was developed using
currently recommended patient centred methods, and is
intended for use in both clinical and research settings. We
believe that it will prove a valuable addition to the range of
such measures on which those working with PBC patients
can draw. The PBC-40 is a profile measure, covering six PBC
specific quality of life domains (cognitive, social, emotional
function, fatigue, itch, and other symptoms). Future work
will explore the possibility of summing the individual
domains in order to produce an overall summary score for
quality of life. This approach has recently been proposed for
the widely used generic HRQOL measure the SF-36.36
It is now generally accepted that the effects of a chronic
illness such as PBC and of its treatment should be measured
in terms of quality not just quantity of survival, and that
failure to do so is neither ‘‘good science nor good medicine’’.37
Formal assessment of quality of life in PBC in both clinical
and research settings requires access, however, to measure￾ment tools that are relevant to the disease, scientifically
sound, and patient centred enough to make such assess￾ments meaningful. The fundamental importance of the role
played by patients in the development process if the last of
these aims is to be achieved is now widely recognised and has
guided the approach adopted in this study.18 38 39 In the
current study, we ensured that our PBC specific quality of life
measure had high validity by employing what have been
referred to as discovery methods19 and involving patients
directly in the identification of quality of life domains to be
covered. We did so both at the stage of initial question
generation by using indepth interviews and during the
subsequent question reduction and validation stages, by
using cognitive interviewing techniques. This approach,
which allowed patients to say what was important and what
was unimportant in our proposed question set, what was
missing, and what was present but redundant, has previously
been identified as being of significant value in the develop￾ment of high quality patient centred quality of life
measures.40 41
Following completion of the derivation steps, the PBC-40
was validated in a large patient cohort and its psychometric
properties assessed. These studies show the PBC-40 to be
highly psychometrically robust. The extent of these validation
studies (involving almost 1000 PBC patients (approximately
5% of the estimated total UK PBC patient population, making
this the largest single clinical study performed in this
condition to date) make the PBC-40 the HRQOL measure
with the best validation for use in PBC to date. Six
psychometric properties of HRQOL measures have been
identified as being importance in determining the utility
and value of such measures.13
The appropriateness of the PBC-40 was ensured by
performing all development steps exclusively in PBC patients.
The acceptability of the PBC-40 was demonstrated by the
feedback at cognitive interviews, and the return rate of .65%
for all postal completion phases of the study. The reliability of
the PBC-40 was demonstrated by Cronbach’s a scores
exceeding the recognised significance threshold of 0.7 for
group comparisons for all six domains31 (with fatigue
cognitive and itch domains exceeding 0.9). ICC scores ranged
from 0.83 to 0.96, demonstrating high test/retest reliability,
again significantly exceeding recognised thresholds.25 The
validity of the PBC-40 was demonstrated by high correlations

with relevant domains of the SF-36 and ESI-55. The precision
of the PBC-40 was demonstrated by the low levels of floor
and ceiling effects. The precision of an HRQOL measure is a
key issue if it is to be of use as a clinical trial outcome
measure or in studies of natural history of the disease.
Significant floor effects (the presence of the minimal possible
scores in patients at study outset) preclude the measurement
of any improvement in patients while significant ceiling
effects (the converse presence of maximum scores at study
outset) preclude the measurement of any deterioration in
symptoms. Ceiling effects were almost entirely absent (an
average of 1.7% of the domain scores from the 260 patients
participating in the second postal stage were at the maximum
level, with maximum score absent from all participants for
the fatigue, social, and symptom domains). This suggests
that the PBC-40 is likely to be of particular use as a clinical
trial outcome measure. Floor effects were seen more
frequently and were particularly marked in the case of the
itch domain (37% of patients registering the lowest possible
score). We believe that this effect is likely to reflect the rather
dichotomous nature of itch in PBC, and the availability and
efficacy of treatments for cholestatic itch (in contradistinc￾tion to the other less easily treatable symptoms of PBC)
rather than a weakness of the PBC-40.
The final psychometric property of HRQOL measures, that
of responsiveness, could not be tested in the PBC-40.
Responsiveness can only be assessed by studying the degree
to which a measure can detect and quantify a beneficial
response to an established treatment previously proven to be
able to improve outcome in the disease of interest.
Unfortunately, no such treatments exist for the symptoms
of PBC42 with the exception of transplantation, a prospective
trial of which was beyond the scope for this study. Indeed,
the imperative to be able to develop and test such treatments
in the future was one of the driving forces for the current
study.
Following validation of the PBC-40 we set out to evaluate it
in comparison with other HRQOL measures previously used
in PBC (FIS, SF-36, and CLDQ). Participants in this phase
were blinded with regard to the specific issue being addressed
and were simply asked to score anonymised and randomly
ordered versions of the four measures on a scale of 1 to 10
regarding the extent to which each measure addressed the
problems relevant to them (they were not at this stage asked
to complete the measures). The PBC-40 was identified as the
most relevant measure by over 80% of patients. Only 3% of
patients felt that the PBC-40 did not address their problems.
In each regard the PBC-40 scored significantly more
favourably than all of the other measures. Several factors
are likely to underpin the greater patient satisfaction seen for
the PBC-40 than for the other PBC applied measures. Unlike
the PBC-40, the other measures studied had not explored
patient views of symptoms in any depth and had been
developed in secondary and tertiary care centres that were
likely to represent a biased sample of individuals with PBC.
Although the component questions for the PBC-40 were
initially generated with patients drawn from hospital out￾patient databases, results of subsequent testing in two
national samples supported the fact that questions in the
measure were meaningful and relevant to a wider UK
audience (further validation studies will have to be
performed before the PBC-40 can appropriately be used in
non-UK populations). Our rigorous approach to question
generation, reduction, and testing ensured that the measure
also met the other currently specified criteria for quality of
life measure development and application29 In particular, we
would draw attention to our use of indepth interviews with a
purposively sampled group of PBC patients as the source of
potential questions, and of adoption of cognitive interviewing
techniques to identify problems with wording of both the
proposed questions and the response options.24 43 44 We would
suggest that both these approaches contributed to the
outcome that patients found the PBC-40 relevant to their
experiences acceptable and easy to complete, as evidenced by
the low overall missing value scores in both the question
reduction and validation surveys.
There are some limitations to the study. The high numbers
of patients who had retired or who had given up work as a
result of PBC meant that three questions relating to employ￾ment were abandoned due to low response rates. The PBC-40
may therefore not fully address the HRQOL of those that
struggle to remain in employment despite the effects of PBC.
However, the significant effect found between the general
question related to giving up work because of PBC and all
domains of the PBC-40 indicates that this question could be
used as an indicator of discriminant validity. Many of our
respondents commented on their inability to separate the
effects of PBC from other conditions. For some, however,
other conditions had preceded PBC for many years and they
were able to compare current quality of life with what life
was like before developing PBC. The effect of comorbidity is
something that needs to be addressed further in future
research.
In conclusion, we suggest that the PBC-40 represents a
potentially important addition to already available HRQOL
measures, being the only one that is truly PBC specific. We
hope its use in clinical and research settings will allow for a
more meaningful assessment of the quality of life of those
affected by this distressing and often poorly understood
condition. We believe that the PBC-40 meets the essential
requirements to become a standard tool for quality of life
outcome assessment in future clinical trials in PBC.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to thank, first and foremost, all those people with PBC
who gave their time and energy towards helping us with this study.
Without their willingness to complete interviews and questionnaires
this study would not have been possible. Our thanks also to the PBC
Foundation, in particular to Collette Thain, Murray Burns, Tilly Hale
and Gillian Billet, whose practical support and guidance was
invaluable. Dr Nick Steen at the Centre for Health Services
Research, University of Newcastle, gave much appreciated statistical
advice. Professor Ian Gilmore of Royal Liverpool University Hospital
helped us to identify individuals with PBC for phase 1 of the study.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 1596
Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a well defined rounded area of fluid
collection anterior to the pancreatic uncus and two rounded calcified masses in the
duodenal region (fig 2). Endoscopic sonography demonstrated an anechoic double walled
cystic lesion adjacent to the pancreas. Based on radiological findings, a diagnosis of
duodenal duplication cysts was considered and exploratory surgery was performed. At
surgery, separation of the mass from the pancreas was difficult. Histopathological
examination confirmed duodenal duplication cyst and found two other cysts containing
enteroliths. Enteroliths were previously described in the natural history of duodenal
duplication in adults. Intestinal duplication cysts are uncommon congenital anomalies and
usually presents during the firsts decade of life. The majority of duplication cysts are tubular
or spherical without any communication with the gastrointestinal tract. Duplication cysts of
the duodenum are very rare, accounting for only 4–5% of intestinal duplications. Endoscopic
sonography is useful, demonstrating anechoic mass surrounded by a double layer intestinal
wall.
