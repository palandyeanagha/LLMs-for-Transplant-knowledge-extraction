Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 
Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3
. Despite intense research 
efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable 
uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei 
province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the 
first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations 
have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. 
Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted 
to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe 
respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA 
sequencing4
 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified 
a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 
‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). 
Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed 
that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of 
SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had 
previously been found in bats in China5
. This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability 
of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.
The patient studied was a 41-year-old man with no history of hepa￾titis, tuberculosis or diabetes. He was admitted to and hospitalized 
in the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019, 6 days after 
the onset of disease. The patient reported fever, chest tightness, 
unproductive cough, pain and weakness for 1 week on presentation 
(Table 1). Physical examination of cardiovascular, abdominal and 
neurological characteristics was that these were normal. Mild lym￾phopoenia (defined as less than 9 × 105
 cells per ml) was observed, 
but white blood cell and blood platelet counts were normal in a com￾plete blood count test. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (41.4 mg l−1
of blood; reference range, 0–6 mg l−1) were observed and the levels 
of aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase and creatine 
kinase were slightly elevated in blood chemistry tests. The patient 
had mild hypoxaemia with oxygen levels of 67 mm Hg as determined 
by an arterial blood gas test. On the first day of admission (day 6 after 
the onset of disease), chest radiographs were abnormal with air-space 
shadowing such as ground-glass opacities, focal consolidation and 
patchy consolidation in both lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1). Computed￾tomography scans of the chest revealed bilateral focal consolidation, 
lobar consolidation and patchy consolidation, especially in the lower 
lung (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral 
diffuse patchy and fuzzy shadow on day 5 after admission (day 11 after 
the onset of disease) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Preliminary aetiological 
investigations excluded the presence of influenza virus, Chlamydia 
pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae using commercial pathogen 
antigen-detection kits, and this was confirmed by PCR. Other common 
respiratory pathogens, including human adenoviruses, also tested 
negative by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Although 
a combination of antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid therapy was 
administered, the patient exhibited respiratory failure and was given 
high-flow non-invasive ventilation. The condition of the patient did not 
improve after 3 days of treatment and he was admitted to the intensive 
care unit. The patient was transferred to another hospital in Wuhan for 
further treatment 6 days after admission.
Epidemiological investigations by the Wuhan Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention revealed that the patient worked at a local 
indoor seafood market. Notably, in addition to fish and shellfish, a 
variety of live wild animals—including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes 
and birds (turtledoves)—were available for sale in the market before 
the outbreak began, as well as animal carcasses and animal meat. No 
bats were available for sale. While the patient might have had contact 
with wild animals at the market, he recalled no exposure to live poultry.
To investigate the possible aetiological agents associated with 
this disease, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and

performed deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing. The clinical 
specimen was handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at Shanghai 
Public Health Clinical Center. Total RNA was extracted from 200 μl 
of BALF and a meta-transcriptomic library was constructed for pair￾end (150-bp reads) sequencing using an Illumina MiniSeq as previ￾ously described4,6–8
. In total, we generated 56,565,928 sequence reads 
that were de novo-assembled and screened for potential aetiological 
agents. Of the 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit9
, the longest 
(30,474 nucleotides (nt)) had a high abundance and was closely related 
to a bat SARS-like coronavirus (CoV) isolate—bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank 
accession number MG772933)—that had previously been sampled in 
China, with a nucleotide identity of 89.1% (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). 
The genome sequence of this virus, as well as its termini, were deter￾mined and confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR (RT–PCR)10 and 
5′/3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively. This virus 
strain was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has 
also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’) and its whole genome sequence 
(29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank accession number MN908947. 
Remapping the RNA-sequencing data to the complete genome of WHCV 
resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome 
coverage at a mean depth of 6.04× (range, 0.01–78.84×) (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). The viral load in the BALF sample was estimated by qPCR 
to be 3.95 × 108
 copies per ml (Extended Data Fig. 4).
The viral genome organization of WHCV was determined by sequence 
alignment to two representative members of the genus Betacoronavi￾rus: a coronavirus associated with humans (SARS-CoV Tor2, GenBank 
accession number AY274119) and a coronavirus associated with bats 
(bat SL-CoVZC45, GenBank accession number MG772933). The un￾translational regions and open-reading frame (ORF) of WHCV were 
mapped on the basis of this sequence alignment and ORF prediction. 
The WHCV viral genome was similar to these two coronaviruses (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Table 3). The order of genes (5′ to 3′) was as follows: 
replicase ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucle￾ocapsid (N). WHCV has 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences that are typical 
of betacoronaviruses, with 265 nt at the 5′ terminal end and 229 nt at 
the 3′ terminal end. The predicted replicase ORF1ab gene of WHCV is 
21,291 nt in length and contained 16 predicted non-structural proteins 
(Supplementary Table 4), followed by (at least) 13 downstream ORFs. 
Additionally, WHCV shares a highly conserved domain (LLRKNGNKG: 
amino acids 122–130) in nsp1 with SARS-CoV. The predicted S, ORF3a, 
E, M and N genes of WHCV are 3,822, 828, 228, 669 and 1,260 nt in length, 
respectively. In addition to these ORF regions, which are shared by all 
members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, WHCV is similar to SARS-CoV 
in that it carries a predicted ORF8 gene (with a length of 366 nt) that is 
located between the M and N ORF genes. The functions of WHCV ORFs 
were predicted on the basis of those of known coronaviruses and are 
described in Supplementary Table 5. In a manner similar to SARS-CoV 
Tor2, a leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and nine puta￾tive body TRSs could be readily identified upstream of the 5′ end of the 
ORF in WHCV, and the putative conserved TRS core sequence appeared 
in two forms—ACGAAC or CUAAAC (Supplementary Table 6).
To determine the evolutionary relationships between WHCV and pre￾viously identified coronaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic trees on 
the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence, 
the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and ORF1b, and the main struc￾tural proteins encoded by the S, E, M and N genes (Fig. 2 and Extended 
Data Fig. 5). In all phylogenies, WHCV clustered with members of the 
subgenus Sarbecovirus, including the SARS-CoV that was responsible 
for the global SARS pandemic1,2
 of 2002–2003, as well as a number 
of SARS-like coronaviruses that have been obtained from bats5,11–13. 
However, WHCV changed topological position within the subgenus 
Sarbecovirus depending on which gene was used, which suggests that 
recombination has occurred in this group of viruses in the past (Fig. 2
and Extended Data Fig. 5). Specifically, in the S gene tree (Extended 
Data Fig. 5), WHCV was most closely related to the bat coronavirus 
SL-CoVZC45 with 82.3% amino acid identity (and around 77.2% amino 
acid identity to SARS-CoV; Supplementary Table 3) whereas in the

ORF1b phylogeny, WHCV fell in a basal position within the subgenus 
Sarbecovirus (Fig. 2). This topological division, which probably reflects 
recombination among the bat sarbecoviruses, was also observed in the 
phylogenetic trees estimated for conserved domains in the replicase 
polyprotein pp1ab (Extended Data Fig. 6).
To better understand the potential of WHCV to infect humans, the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein was compared 
with those of SARS-CoVs and bat SARS-like CoVs. The RBD sequences 
of WHCV were more closely related to those of SARS-CoVs (73.8–74.9% 
amino acid identity) and SARS-like CoVs, including strains Rs4874, 
Rs7327 and Rs4231 (75.9–76.9% amino acid identity), that are able to use 
the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry11 (Supplementary Table 7). In 
addition, the RBD of the spike protein from WHCV was only one amino 
acid longer than the RBD of the spike protein from SARS-CoV (Extended

Data Fig. 7a). By contrast, other bat SARS-like CoVs—including the Rp3 
strain that cannot bind to human ACE214—had amino acid deletions 
at positions 433–437 and 460–472 compared with the sequence in 
SARS-CoVs (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The previously determined15 crystal 
structure of the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV complexed with 
human ACE2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2AJF) revealed that regions 
433–437 and 460–472 directly interact with human ACE2 and hence 
may be important in determining species specificity (Extended Data 
Fig. 7b). We predicted the three-dimensional protein structures of the 
RBD domains of the spike protein of WHCV, Rs4874 and Rp3 by protein 
homology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL server and compared 
them to the crystal structure of RBD domain of the spike protein of 
SARS-CoV (PDB 2GHV) (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f). In accordance with 
the sequence alignment, the predicted protein structures of the RBD 
domains of WHCV and Rs4874 were closely related to that of SARS-CoV 
and different from the predicted structure of the RBD domain from 
Rp3. In addition, the N terminus of the spike protein of WHCV is more 
similar to that of SARS-CoV than other human coronaviruses (HKU1 
and OC43) (Extended Data Fig. 8) that can bind to sialic acid16. In sum￾mary, the high similarities of the amino acid sequences and predicted 
protein structures of the RBD domains of WHCV and SARS-CoV suggest 
that WHCV may efficiently use human ACE2 as a receptor for cellular 
entry, which could potentially facilitate human-to-human transmis￾sion11,17,18.
To further characterize the putative recombination events in the evo￾lutionary history of the sarbecoviruses, the whole-genome sequence 
of WHCV and four representative coronaviruses—bat SARS-like CoV 
Rp3, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV Tor2—were analysed using the 
Recombination Detection Program v.4 (RDP4)19. Although the similar￾ity plots suggested that possible recombination events had occurred 
between WHCV and SARS-CoVs or SARS-like CoVs (Extended Data 
Fig. 9), there was no significant evidence for recombination across the 
genome as a whole. However, some evidence for past recombination 
was detected in the S gene of WHCV, SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs 
(WIV1 and RsSHC014) (P < 3.147 × 10−3 to P < 9.198 × 10−9), for which the 
similarity plots suggested the presence of recombination breakpoints 
at nucleotides 1,029 and 1,652, which separate the S gene of WHCV into 
three regions (Fig. 3). In phylogenies of the nucleotide fragments from 
1 to 1,029 and from 1,652 to the end of the sequence, WHCV was most 
closely related to bat SL-CoVZC45 and bat SL-CoVZXC21, whereas in the 
region of nucleotides 1,030 to 1,651 (the RBD region) WHCV grouped 
with SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs (WIV1 and RsSHC014) that are 
capable of direct human transmission17,20. Despite these recombination 
events, which seem relatively common among sarbecoviruses, there is 
no evidence that recombination has facilitated the emergence of WHCV.
Coronaviruses are associated with a number of infectious disease 
outbreaks in humans, including SARS in 2002–2003 and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 20121,21. Four other coronaviruses—
human coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E—are also associ￾ated with respiratory disease22–25. Although SARS-like coronaviruses 
have been widely identified in mammals including bats since 2005 in 
China10,26–28, the exact origin of human-infected coronaviruses remains 
unclear. Here we describe a new coronavirus—WHCV—in the BALF from 
a patient who experienced severe respiratory disease in Wuhan, China. 
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that WHCV is a member of the genus 
Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) that has some genomic and 
phylogenetic similarities to SARS-CoV1
, particularly in the RBD of the 
spike protein. These genomic and clinical similarities to SARS, as well as 
its high abundance in clinical samples, provides evidence for an associa￾tion between WHCV and the ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease 
in Wuhan and across the world. Although the isolation of the virus 
from only a single patient is not sufficient to conclude that it caused 
these respiratory symptoms, our findings have been independently 
corroborated in further patients in a separate study29.

The identification of multiple SARS-like CoVs in bats have led to 
the idea that these animals act as hosts of a natural reservoir of these 
viruses22,23. Although SARS-like viruses have been identified widely in 
bats in China, viruses identical to SARS-CoV have not yet been docu￾mented. Notably, WHCV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses, 
and shows 100% amino acid similarity to bat SL-CoVZC45 in the nsp7 
and E proteins (Supplementary Table 3). Thus, these data suggest that 
bats are a possible host for the viral reservoir of WHCV. However, as a 
variety of animal species were for sale in the market when the disease 
was first reported, further studies are needed to determine the natural 
reservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV.
Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV has 
designated the virus as SARS-CoV-230; in addition, the WHO has released 
the official name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1931.

Methods
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Patient information and collection of clinical data and sample
A patient presenting with acute onset of fever (temperature over 
37.5 °C), cough and chest tightness, who was admitted to the Central 
Hospital of Wuhan, in Wuhan, China, was considered to be a suspected 
case. During admission, BALF was collected and stored at −80 °C 
until further processing. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data 
were retrieved from the clinical records of the patient. The study was 
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the National Insti￾tute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention. Signed written informed consent 
was obtained from the patient.
RNA library construction and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from the BALF sample using the RNeasy Plus 
Universal Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The quantity and quality of the RNA solution was assessed using a Qbit 
machine and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) before 
library construction and sequencing. An RNA library was then con￾structed using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v.2 (TaKaRa). 
Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed during library construc￾tion following the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end (150-bp 
reads) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the MiniSeq 
platform (Illumina). Library preparation and sequencing were carried 
out at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, 
Shanghai, China.
Data processing and identification of the viral agent
Sequencing reads were first adaptor and quality trimmed using the 
Trimmomatic program32. The remaining 56,565,928 reads were assem￾bled de novo using both Megahit (v.1.1.3)9
 and Trinity (v.2.5.1)33 with 
default parameter settings. Megahit generated a total of 384,096 assem￾bled contigs (size range of 200–30,474 nt), whereas Trinity generated 
1,329,960 contigs with a size range of 201–11,760 nt. All of these assem￾bled contigs were compared (using BLASTn and Diamond BLASTx) 
against the entire non-redundant (nr) nucleotide and protein databases, 
with e values set to 1 × 10−10 and 1 × 10−5, respectively. To identify possible 
aetiological agents present in the sequencing data, the abundance 
of the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the expected counts 
using the RSEM program34 implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads 
(23,712,657 reads), generated by filtering host reads using the human 
genome (human release 32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded from Gencode) 
by Bowtie235, were used for the RSEM abundance assessment.
As the longest contigs generated by Megahit (30,474 nt) and Trin￾ity (11,760 nt) both showed high similarity to the bat SARS-like coro￾navirus isolate bat SL-CoVZC45 and were found at a high abundance 
(Supplementary Tables 1, 2), the longer sequence (30,474 nt)—which 
covered almost the whole virus genome—was used for primer design for 
PCR confirmation and determination of the genome termini. Primers 
used for PCR, qPCR and RACE experiments are listed in Supplemen￾tary Table 8. The PCR assay was conducted as previously described10
and the complete genome termini was determined using the Takara 
SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ kit (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Subsequently, the genome coverage and sequencing depth were 
determined by remapping all of the adaptor- and quality-trimmed 
reads to the whole genome of WHCV using Bowtie235 and Samtools36.
The viral loads of WHCV in BALF were determined by quantitative 
real-time RT–PCR using the Takara One Step PrimeScript RT–PCR kit 
(Takara RR064A) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time 
RT–PCR was performed using 2.5 μl RNA with 8 pmol of each primer 
and 4 pmol probe under the following conditions: reverse transcription 
at 42 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 
15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The reactions were performed and detected 
by ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems. The PCR product covering the 
Taqman primers and probe region was cloned into pLB vector using 
the Lethal Based Simple Fast Cloning Kit (TianGen) as standards for 
quantitative viral load test.
Virus genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis
For the newly identified virus genome, the potential ORFs were pre￾dicted and annotated using the conserved signatures of the cleavage 
sites recognized by coronavirus proteinases, and were processed in 
the Lasergene software package (v.7.1, DNAstar). The viral genes were 
aligned using the L-INS-i algorithm implemented in MAFFT (v.7.407)37.
Phylogenetic analyses were then performed using the nucleotide 
sequences of various CoV gene datasets: (1) whole genome, (2) ORF1a, 
(3) ORF1b, (4) nsp5 (3CLpro), (5) RdRp (nsp12), (6) nsp13 (Hel), (7) nsp14 
(ExoN), (8) nsp15 (NendoU), (9) nsp16 (O-MT), (10) spike (S) and (11) 
nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the maxi￾mum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML program (v.3.0)38, 
using the generalized time reversible substitution model and subtree 
pruning and regrafting branch swapping. Bootstrap support values 
were calculated from 1,000 pseudo-replicate trees. The best-fitting 
model of nucleotide substitution was determined using MEGA (v.5)39. 
Amino acid identities among sequences were calculated using the 
MegAlign program implemented in the Lasergene software package 
(v.7.1, DNAstar).
Genome recombination analysis
Potential recombination events in the history of the sarbecoviruses 
were assessed using both the RDP419 and Simplot (v.3.5.1)40. The RDP4 
analysis was conducted based on the complete genome (nucleotide) 
sequence, using RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, maximum chi square, 
Chimera, SISCAN and 3SEQ methods. Putative recombination events 
were identified with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.01. 
Similarity plots were inferred using Simplot to further characterize 
potential recombination events, including the location of possible 
breakpoints.
Analysis of the RBD domain of the spike protein of WHCV
An amino acid sequence alignment of RBD sequences from WHCV, 
SARS-CoVs and bat SARS-like CoVs was performed using MUSCLE41. 
The predicted protein structures of the RBD of the spike protein were 
estimated based on target–template alignment using ProMod3 on 
SWISS-MODEL server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The sequences 
of the RBD domains spike of WHCV, Rs4874 and Rp3 were searched 
by BLAST against the primary amino acid sequence contained in the 
SWISS-MODEL template library (last update, 9 January 2020; last 
included PDB release, 3 January 2020). Models were built based on 
the target–template alignment using ProMod3. The global and per￾residue model quality was assessed using the QMEAN scoring func￾tion42. The PDB files of the predicted protein structures were displayed 
and compared with the crystal structures of the spike RBD of SARS-CoV 
(PDB 2GHV)43 and the crystal of structure of the spike RBD of SARS-CoV 
complexed with human ACE2 (PDB 2AJF)15.

N-terminal domain of the spike protein of WHCV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), 
mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV OC43 and HKU1) 
that can bind to sialic acid and the SARS-CoVs that cannot (SZ3, WH20, BJ0 and 
Tor2). The key residues16 for sialic acid binding on BCoV, MHV, and HCoV OC43 
and HKU1 are highlighted by orange squares.

Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency 
in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Sample size The goal of this study was to find out the possible aetiologic agents associated with the severe respiratory disease occurred recently in the city 
of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. We studied one patient, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from him who exhibited severe 
respiratory syndrome including fever, dizzy and cough. Since it is a discovery study, the number of individuals is irrelevant to the conclusions 
drawn in the paper.
Data exclusions No data was excluded from the analyses.
Replication The de novo assembly of reads was performed using two programs. 
The whole genome viral sequence obtained from read assembly was confirmed by PCR assays. 
The results from phylogenetic and recombination analyses were confirmed by multiple runs.
Randomization Not applicable. The goal of this study was to find out the possible aetiologic agent associated with the severe respiratory disease occurred 
recently in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since we could obtain the BALF sample from only one patient who exhibited severe 
respiratory syndrome including fever, dizzy and cough, hence, randomization was not applicable to this study.
Blinding Not applicable. Only one RNA library was generated in this study and thus no group allocation was performed.

Population characteristics Recently, a severe respiratory disease emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China. The aim of this study is to find out 
the etiologic agent. Although clinic records from seven patients were available in this study, BAFL sample was only obtained from 
one patient. Herein, only one patient was described in the text based on the comments by Referees. 
Recruitment The patient who exhibited clinic signs of respiratory disease including fever and cough was recruited.
