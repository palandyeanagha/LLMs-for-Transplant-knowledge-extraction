Laminin a non-collagenous glycoprotein is a major component of the renal glomerular basement membrane and
mesangium. Thus far eleven distinct chains have been described, permutations of which make up 15 laminin
isoforms. Laminin molecules interact with cells and other matrix molecules during organ development and
differentiation. We studied the distribution of laminin isoforms in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy,
membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy/ Henoch–Scho¨n￾lein purpura. Immunofluorescence microscopic studies with laminin-chain-specific antibodies to the a1, a2,
a5, b1, b2 and c1 chains detected a2, b1 and c1 chain expression in the normal mesangium and a5, b2 and c1 in
normal glomerular basement membrane. Significantly, constituents of the glomerular basement membrane, a5,
b2 and c1 chains were overexpressed in kidneys with diabetic nephropathy. Initially the constituents of the
mesangium increased commensurate with the degree of mesangial expansion and degree of diabetic
nephropathy. Reduction in a2 chain intensity was observed with severe mesangial expansion and in the areas
of nodular glomerulosclerosis. In addition, with late disease aberrant expression of a2 and b2 chains was
observed in the mesangium. Glomerular basement membrane in renal disease overexpressed molecules
normally present in that location. In summary, the alterations in basement membrane composition in various
renal diseases seem to not only reflect the balance between synthesis and degradation of normal basement
membrane constituents, but also their aberrant expression.

Laminin is a major non-collagenous glycoprotein
component of glomerular basement membrane and
mesangium and consists of three different polypep￾tide chains designated a, b and g. Laminin was first
isolated from EHS mouse tumor and subsequently
found to be a cross-shaped disulfide-bonded hetero￾trimer composed of a 400-kDa a1 chain along with
b1 and g1 chains of approximately 200 kDa. Eleven
distinct laminin chains have been described to date
(five a, three b and three g chains). These chains can
combine into at least 15 different laminin isoforms,
Lm-111 to Lm-523.1–3
Laminins are involved in multiple interactions
with other basement membrane components and
cells and play important roles in the supramolecular
assembly of extracellular matrix and the stability of
basement membrane.3–5 Laminins also help mediate
various cellular functions, including growth,
differentiation and attachment. The distribution of
laminin chains in the glomerulus is site-specific and
associated with the presence of different isoforms
in the glomerular basement membrane and the
mesangium. Therefore the a5, b2 and g1 chains are
present in normal adult human glomerular base￾ment membrane, whereas a1, a2 and b1 chains are
not.2,6–8 Only a2, a4, b1 and g1 chains are present in
the normal adult mesangium.2,9 Therefore, glomeru￾lar basement membrane and mesangium in normal
adult human kidneys expresses different isoforms of
laminin: Lm-521 (a5, b2 and g1) in glomerular
basement membrane and Lm-211/411 (a2/a4, b1
and g1) in the mesangium. Received 14 May 2009; revised 25 November 2011; accepted 9

In addition, there is considerable variation in the
distribution of laminin isoforms in the developing
kidney. Nephrogenesis is a complex process during
which the unique elements of the glomerular base￾ment membrane, mesangial matrix, tubular base￾ment membrane and blood vessels come together.
In developing rodent glomeruli, the transition of
type IV collagen isoforms is accompanied by the
transition of laminin isoforms.2,10 Although collagen
a1(IV) and a2(IV) are found in all developing
glomerular basement membrane together with lami￾nin b1 chain, the expression of laminin b2 chain is
associated with collagen a3–5(IV) in the glomerular

basement membrane of more mature glomeruli.
In other words, transition of collagen a1–2(IV) to
a3–5(IV) during the glomerular basement membrane
development is associated with the transition of
laminin chains from b1 to b2. Mutant mice lacking
the COL4A3 gene for a3(IV) also lack a3–5(IV)
chains in the glomerular basement membrane with
persistence of a1–2(IV).11 Nonetheless, the laminin
b1 to b2 switch occurs in rodents11 and in man.6
This suggests that collagen IV and laminin networks
in glomerular basement membrane are regulated
independently. Mutant mice lacking laminin b2
chain show structurally intact glomerular basement
membrane M with normal developmental transition
of type IV collagen isoforms.12 The severe protein￾uria in these mice suggests that the laminin b2 chain
has an important role in glomerular permselectivity
through the maintenance of normal glomerular
basement membrane structure or normal podocyte
maturation. Recent studies show that glomerular
basement membrane is a real barrier for albumin
as proteinuria precedes podocyte abnormality in
Lamb21/1 mice.13 Taken together, the transitions of
laminin and type IV collagen isoforms, which
normally coincide, appear to have specific roles in
various stages of renal development. In this report, we
examined the distribution of laminin isoforms in
normal human kidneys and in various disease states.
Materials and methods
Kidney tissues were obtained from 12 patients with
overt type 1 diabetic nephropathy, 5 patients with type
I idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephri￾tis, 12 patients with Henoch–Scho¨nlein purpura/IgA
nephropathy, 5 patients with idiopathic membranous
nephropathy and 14 normal controls including three
adult kidney donors (age range, 3 to 59 years). The
frozen material used in this study was residue of
biopsies obtained for diagnostic purposes. This study
was performed with the permission of the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Minnesota.
Antibodies
The monoclonal antibodies used in this study
are listed in Table 1. FITC-conjugated and

nephropathy; (c) severe diabetic nephropathy; (d) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In the normal glomerulus the Lm a5 chain
overlies the glomerular basement membrane but is not detected in the mesangium. In diabetic nephropathy the Lm a5 chain overlies
the thickened glomerular basement membrane. There is only a segmental reaction in the mesangium in mild diabetic nephropathy,
which progresses to diffuse staining as the mesangium expands further in severe diabetic nephropathy. In membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis, the Lm a5 chain is detected in the expanded mesangium and glomerular basement membrane.

tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC)-conju￾gated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Caltag
(South San Francisco, CA, USA) and ICN-Cappel
(Irvine, CA, USA); FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG
from Pel Freeze (Rogers, AR, USA) and Jackson
Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA); FITC-conjugated
goat anti-human IgG from Kallestedt (Austin, TX,
USA) and ICN-Cappel. All secondary antibodies were
absorbed with normal human serum.
Immunohistological Methods
Immunofluorescence studies were carried out as
previously described.14 Kidney tissues were snap￾frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen,
sectioned at 4 mm in a cryostat at constant room
temperature (251C) and humidity (30%), and fixed
with acetone for 10 min. The slides were exposed to
primary antibodies followed by FITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Dual fluorochrome labeling
was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-lami￾nin a2 chain detected with rhodamine-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by rat monoclonal
anti-type IV collagen (a1(IV)NC, where NC denotes
non-collagenous) detected with FITC-conjugated
goat anti-rat IgG (absorbed with human and mouse
sera). Appropriate controls were as previously
described.14 P-phenylenediamine in PBS glycerol
was applied to fluorochrome-stained tissue sections
to retard fluorescence quenching and sections
were examined using epifluoroscence microscope
with appropriate filters (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).
Morphometry
Routine stereological techniques, previously
described in detail,15 were used to measure mesan￾gial fraction of glomerular volume in 12 patients
with diabetic nephropathy. Mesangial fraction
of glomerular volume in patients with diabetic
nephropathy ranged from 0.22 to 0.55 with normal
being o0.2.
Results
Immunoreactivity for Lm a5, b2 and g1 chains
was found in the glomerular basement membrane
in normal adult human kidneys, whereas Lm a1, a2

and expanded mesangium.

and b1 chains were absent (Table 2, Figures 1a–5a,
Lm a1 not shown). Only a2, b1 and g1 chains were
present in the mesangium. The intensity and extent
of mesangial immunoreactivity for laminin chains,
in contrast to type IV collagen, were quite variable in
different normal kidneys ranging from trace focal to
intense diffuse labeling.
The thickened glomerular basement membrane in
mild diabetic nephropathy showed increased reac￾tivity (both the area and the intensity of the staining)
only with antibodies to the normal laminin consti￾tuents of glomerular basement membrane, namely
Lm a5, b2 and g1 chains (Table 2, Figures 1b–5b).
Mild to moderate mesangial expansion in diabetic
nephropathy, in contrast, was associated not only
with the increased reactivity with antibodies to the
normal laminin constituents of mesangial matrix,
but also with the aberrant expression of normal
glomerular basement membrane components, Lm a5
and b2 chains (Table 2, Figures 1b–5b). As the
mesangial expansion progressed further in diabetic
nephropathy, there was a striking decrease or
disappearance of Lm a2 chain, whereas other laminin
chains and type IV collagen [a1(IV)NC] continued to
increase (Figures 1c–5c and 6–8). These findings are
summarized in Table 2. In the 12 diabetic nephro￾pathy cases where mesangial fraction of glomerular
volume was determined, the reduction in a2 chain
intensity was only noted when mesangial fraction of
glomerular volume exceeded 0.45 (4 cases) and in the
area of nodular glomerulosclerosis.
In membranous nephropathy, like in mild diabetic
nephropathy, there was thickening of the glomerular
basement membrane with increased reactivity
of antibodies to the normal glomerular basement
membrane constituents Lm a5, b2 and g1 chains
(Table 2, figures not shown).
Cases of Henoch–Scho¨nlein purpura/IgA nephro￾pathy expressed increased normal mesangial consti￾tuents a2, b1 and g1 chains and aberrantly expressed
Lm a5 and b2 chains (Table 2, figures not shown).
Cases of membranoproliferative glomerulonephri￾tis behaved similar to severe diabetic nephropathy,
with a decrease or disappearance of Lm a2 chain
while overexpressing normal mesangial constituents
b1 and g1 and type IV collagen [a1(IV)NC] and
aberrantly expressing a5 and b2 chains (Table 2,
Figures 1d–5d and 9).

Discussion
Glomerular structural–functional relationships have
been demonstrated in a variety of kidney diseases.15–18
There is a close correlation between mesangial
expansion and renal function in diabetic nephropathy
and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. These
structural changes are due, at least in part, to
alterations in the composition of extracellular matrix
and basement membrane constituents, which reflect
disturbances in the balance between extracellular
matrix and basement membrane synthesis and degra￾dation. Although it is generally believed that these
alterations involve only the normal extracellular
matrix and basement membrane constituents, more
recent studies have shown aberrant expression of
basement membrane proteins in various renal dis￾eases. In human Alport syndrome and in the murine
collagen COL4A3 knockout model, type IV collagen a1
and a2 chains, type V collagen, type VI collagen
and laminin a2 chains are abnormally expressed in
the glomerular basement membrane in association
with the absence of the a3, a4 and a5 chains of type IV
collagen.8,9,19–22 Lm-111 (a1, b1 and g1), normally
present only in the mesangium was detected in the
glomerular basement membrane of sclerotic glomeruli
in murine lupus nephritis.23 Studies of membranous
nephropathy have demonstrated increased expression
in the glomerular basement membrane of normal
constituents Lm b2 and a1, a 3 and a5 chains of
type IV collagen and variable aberrant expression
of Lm b1.24
In our study, progressive mesangial expansion
in diabetic nephropathy, membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis and Henoch–Scho¨nlein
purpura/IgA nephropathy was associated with
aberrant mesangial expression of Lm a5 and b2
chains normally expressed only in adult glomerular
basement membrane and with the decrease and the
disappearance of mesangium-specific laminin
chains, a2 in marked mesangial expansion. This
loss of normally expressed and aberrant expression
of Lm isoforms may be deleterious for renal
function. Earlier studies by Kikkawa et al25 have
demonstrated that mesangial cells organize the
glomerular capillaries by adhering to a specific

nephropathy; (c) severe diabetic nephropathy; (d) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In normal glomeruli, the Lm g1 chain
overlies both the glomerular basement membrane and the mesangium. In diabetic nephropathy, there is intense immunoreactivity in both
the thickened glomerular basement membrane and the expanded mesangium. In membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, there is
intense reactivity in the expanded mesangium with positive staining reaction in glomerular basement membrane.

domain of Lm a5 chain in the glomerular basement
membrane. Thus, a disorganized laminin 521 with
abnormal expression of glomerular basement mem￾brane can likely lead to disorganization of glomer￾ular capillaries and therefore to aberrant glomerular
function.
Phenotypic alterations of extracellular matrix
synthetic profiles of glomerular cells have been
observed during nephrogenesis and in vitro studies.
Both laminin a5 and b2 chains are expressed in the
mesangium of early and late capillary stages of fetal
glomeruli with the disappearance in mesangium
of normal adult kidneys (personal observation).
Mesangial cells in vitro synthesize significant
amount of interstitial collagens, which are not
present in normal mesangium, most likely reflecting
dedifferentiation.26 One of the explanations for the
disappearance of laminin b2 in the markedly
expanded mesangium could be due to the masking
of an epitope occurring due to the progression of
mesangial expansion. However, since the two
monoclonal antibodies we used were against differ￾ent epitopes of laminin b2 and both gave identical
staining characteristics; the possibility of a ‘hidden
epitope’ is negated. In addition, persistent expres￾sion of other laminin chains and type IV collagen in
markedly expanded mesangium makes the hidden
epitope explanation unlikely. It has been suggested
that the mesangium in disease states may be popu￾lated by cells originating from extraglomerular sites
such as the bone marrow or the juxtaglomerular
apparatus.27–29 These translocated cells could express
different matrix synthetic profiles, although it is
equally plausible that resident mesangial cells under￾go dedifferentiation due to disease related alterations
in cytokines/growth factors or local architectural
changes representing advancing disease processes.
We believe that changes in the A2 isoform of
laminin reflect the degree of mesangial matrix
expansion. In other words, in early/mild mesangial
expansion as occurs in mild diabetic nephropathy or
Henoch–Scho¨nlein purpura/IgA nephropathy, there
is an increase in expression of the A2 isoform,
whereas in severe diabetic nephropathy or membra￾noproliferative glomerulonephritis, there is a
decrease. Although it is unclear as to why this
happens, we speculate that this may be due to
masking of an epitope for the A2 isoform of laminin
or dedifferentiation of mesangial cells, which occurs
as mesangial expansion progresses.
In summary, the alterations in basement mem￾brane composition in various renal diseases seem to

not only reflect the balance between synthesis and
degradation of normal basement membrane consti￾tuents, but also the aberrant new expression of
basement membrane molecules. Thus, tissue remo￾deling may incorporate both an increase of normal
constituents and emergence of abnormal constitu￾ents during disease exemplified by diabetes.
