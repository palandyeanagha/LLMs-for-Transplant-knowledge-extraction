Background: Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) is reported as an innovative strategy for
children with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) to bridge to transplantation or recovery. We
report our early experience with PAB to evaluate outcomes, indications, and limitations.
Materials and Methods: This is a single-center prospective clinical study, including
infants and children admitted for ESHF owing to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with
preserved right ventricular function after failure of maximal conventional therapy. All
patients underwent perioperative anticongestive medical therapy with ACE inhibitor, beta
blocker, and spironolactone. Post-operatively, all patients underwent echocardiographic
follow-up to assess myocardial recovery.
Results: We selected five patients (four males) who underwent PAB at a median age
of 8.6 months (range 3.9–42.2 months), with preoperative ejection fraction (EF) < 30%.
Sternal closure was delayed in all. One patient did not improve after PAB and underwent
Berlin Heart implantation after 33 days, followed by heart transplant after 13 months. Four
patients were discharged home on full anticongestive therapy. However, 2 months after
discharge, one patient experienced severe acute heart failure secondary to pneumonia,
which required mechanical circulatory support, and the patient underwent a successful
heart transplant after 21 days. The remaining three patients are doing well at home, 22.4,
16.9, and 15.4 months after PAB. They all underwent elective percutaneous de-banding,
18.5, 4.8, and 10.7 months after PAB. EF increased from 17.7 ± 8.5% to 63.3 ± 7.6%
(p = 0.03), and they have all been delisted.
Conclusion: Use of PAB may be an effective alternative to mechanical support in
selected infants for bridging to transplant or recovery. Better results seem to occur in
patients aged < 12 months. Further experience and research are required to identify
responders and non-responders to this approach.

Di Candia et al. Pulmonary Banding for Dilated Cardiomyopathy
INTRODUCTION
Significant advances in end-stage heart failure (ESHF) therapy
have been achieved and documented in adult patients in recent
years, whereas the mechanisms and therapy of heart failure
in children are still unknown (1, 2). The ultimate therapy for
ESHF is heart transplantation (HT) (3, 4). However, this is not
readily available in infants and children (5–7). Therefore, novel
therapeutic strategies are needed.
Long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is currently
possible and effective even in neonates and infants with ESHF,
thanks to the extracorporeal Berlin Heart EXCORR
, which
is the only currently available ventricular assist device (VAD)
in patients weighing <10 kg (5, 8). However, the incidence
of major lethal or disabling complications is not negligible,
and the management of Berlin Heart often requires long￾term hospitalization with increased hospital costs and patient
discomfort (5).
On the basis of the hypothesis that ventricle–ventricular
interaction can benefit dilated left ventricular failure, Schranz
et al. (1) proposed an innovative application of the pulmonary
artery banding (PAB) as an effective treatment of ESHF in
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in young children (< 6 years
of age) with preserved right ventricular function. A multicenter
experience with PAB for DCM in selected pediatric patients has
been recently reported, (9) with satisfactory results. However, no
clear indications have been described, and open debate is still
ongoing whether this procedure is valid, or these patients would
experience recovery anyway from viral myocarditis.
On the basis of this background and experiences, since 2015,
we have embarked on the “PAB strategy” for treating ESHF
in infants. We herein report the early results of our ongoing
clinical experience, aiming at outlining indications, outcomes,
and limitations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a single-center, prospective, clinical study including
infants and children with DCM since September 2015. Inclusion
criteria were as follows: age < 4 years, evidence of left
ventricle dysfunction, and preserved right ventricle function;
being listed for transplant, as indicated elsewhere (1); and
failure of conventional inotropic therapy, with more than
two intensive care unit (ICU) admissions within the same
hospitalization. Excluded were patients with biventricular
failure, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, idiopathic or reactive
pulmonary hypertension, and associated major congenital heart
disease (CHD; such as the anomalous origin of a coronary
artery from the pulmonary artery). Preoperative, intraoperative,
and post-operative data were retrieved from our institutional
database, including clinical and follow-up periodical reports. The
patients’ echocardiographic evaluation was always done by two
cardiologists (AC and BC). The local hospital committee on
clinical investigation approved the review of medical records, and
individual patients’ data were anonymized. Parental consent for
salvage procedure was obtained.
Before PAB, all patients underwent full congestive heart
failure (CHF) medical therapy, as recommended by Schranz
et al. (2) (lisinopril, bisoprolol, and spironolactone). Whenever
clinical condition was unstable, the patient was admitted in
pediatric ICU and intubated and mechanically ventilated, and
intravenous infusion of inotropes (dopamine and milrinone) and
levosimendan were started. It is of note that as suggested by
Schranz (2), furosemide was used only in case of extreme oliguria
(<1 cm3
/kg/h).
Echocardiographic evaluation was focused on the estimation
of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (calculated by the
Simpson method), mitral and tricuspid valves regurgitation
[according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
recommendations], (10) and trans-PAB pressure gradient
(assessed by continuous Doppler velocity gradient –dPmax =
4 × Vmax2
). The right ventricle function was assessed using
tricuspid annular peak systolic excursion (TAPSE). All these data
were evaluated before and after PAB and at the last available
follow-up evaluation.
All patients underwent PAB through a midline sternotomy,
as described elsewhere (1), with a PTFE band, under continuous
trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) monitoring. In
particular, the PAB was tightened with 7.0 prolene stitches to
facilitate later balloon dilation. Pulmonary artery pressure and
right ventricle pressure were measured continuously through
trans-thoracic intracardiac lines. The PAB was tightened to
obtain a right ventricle pressure equal to 70% of systemic blood
pressure, or until TEE was showing a leftward shift of the
interventricular septum, or TAPSE reduction, or increasing
tricuspid regurgitation. Chest closure was delayed in all patients
to facilitate ventricular and pulmonary compliance recovery
and to facilitate additional post-operative tightening of the PAB,
if required.
Statistical Analysis
All the analyses were performed using a commercially available
package (SPSS, Rel 18.0 2009, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Quantitative
values are presented as mean + 1 SD and median value.
Continuous variables were compared by using a t-test for paired
data. The null hypothesis was rejected for a p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Five patients (M/F = 4/1) with a median age of 8.6 months
(range 3.9–42.2) underwent PAB for ESHF. Three patients were
reporting symptoms like fever, malaise, and upper respiratory
tract infection before admission. All patients were negative at
autoimmune and inborn metabolic disease screening. Three
patients were found to be positive for viral infection (Table 1).
Pathological analysis of trans-parietal right and left ventricle
myocardial tissues showed active lymphocytic myocarditis in
four and chronic myocarditis in one. Besides, endocardial
fibroelastosis was found in two.
On admission, the mean baseline EF was 15.4 ± 6.8%; mitral
valve regurgitation was moderate in four and mild in one
patient; mean TAPSE value was 11.1 ± 4.1 mm. Last, tricuspid
regurgitation was trivial or mild in all. No patient required

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support before
PAB (Table 2).
There were no intraoperative deaths (Table 3, Figure 1).
After PAB, TEE monitoring clearly showed decreased mitral
valve regurgitation and a leftward shift of interventricular
septum in all. All patients underwent a delayed sternal
closure after a median time of 3 days (range 2–9 days).
The PAB was tightened in four over five patients in ICU,
and the median trans-PAB pressure gradient at transthoracic
echocardiogram (TTE) at chest closure was 30 mmHg (range
30–55 mmHg).
The perioperative course was complicated in one patient
only (#2), a 3.5-year-old male who was admitted emergently,
already intubated, with left atrial massive dilation, which
was compressing the left mainstem bronchus. Unlike the
other patients, this child underwent PAB and decompressive
atrial septostomy on pump. Furthermore, owing to unstable
hemodynamic conditions, ECMO support was required for 7
days. Despite weaning off ECMO, his hemodynamic condition
remained unstable, with EF < 30%, requiring massive inotropic
support and mechanical ventilation, Thus, he underwent
elective left Berlin Heart EXCORR
implantation 33 days
after PAB.
When the last patient was excluded, the median ventilation
time, ICU, and hospital stay were 9.5 (6–12), 16.3 (10–20),
and 39 days (35–54), respectively. All remaining patients were
discharged home with full CHF therapy (lisinopril, bisoprolol,
and spironolactone).
At a median follow-up of 30.2 months (25.4–55.7), all patients
are alive and well. Two patients required HT after PAB. Patient #1
experienced acute pneumonia 3 months after PAB and required
hospitalization in another hospital, where he had severe low

cardiac output syndrome and required emergent venous arterial
(VA) ECMO support. He was listed for transplant, and he
underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR implantation. After 7 days of
VAD support, he was successfully heart transplanted. He is
currently in excellent conditions 48 months after transplantation,
with no residual disabilities.
Patient #2, as mentioned above, underwent a successful
HT after 12 months of uneventful VAD support, is in
excellent clinical conditions 40 months after transplantation,
and is on immunosuppressant therapy, with healthy
neuropsychological development.
The remaining three patients had a progressive improvement
of symptoms and left ventricular function. Follow-up data
are presented in Table 4. Two of them (patients #3 and
#4) had a complete cardiac function recovery. However,
their early post-discharge period was characterized by
relapsing signs of CHF, concomitantly to lung infections,
which required rehospitalization and inotropic therapy with
levosimendan 3 and 2.5 months after PAB, respectively.
Patient #5 improved his cardiac function significantly but
had no complete recovery yet, despite an uneventful clinical
course. All of them underwent an elective percutaneous
PAB balloon dilation 18.5, 4.8, and 10.7 months after PAB,
respectively, because of the detection of progressive right
ventricle hypertension and hypertrophy, with increased
tricuspid regurgitation at control echocardiography. All patients
tolerated this procedure well and had a substantial benefit from
partial de-banding.
At the most recent follow-up (22.4, 16.9, and 15.4 months after
PAB), these three patients are in Ross class I and thriving well. At
the last echocardiography monitoring (Table 5), left ventricular
end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) decreased from a mean value of
12.8 ± 2.9 mm at baseline (z-score 11.4 ± 2.1) to 7.6 ± 1.8 mm
(z-score 1.97 ± 3.14, p = 0.01), whereas EF increased to 63.3 ±
7.6% (p = 0.03 compared with baseline, Figure 2). Also, there
was no or trivial mitral regurgitation (Figure 3), trivial or mild
tricuspid regurgitation with preserved TAPSE values (p = 0.27
compared with baseline) and trans-pulmonary gradient of 50–
55 mmHg. All patients had a gradual decrease in plasma levels
of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/pro-BNP, and they have all
been ultimately removed from the transplant list, respectively 9,
10, and 12 months after PAB.

DISCUSSION
Epidemiology and State of the Art of
End-Stage Heart Failure Treatment in
Pediatric Age
Population-based studies in the United States, Finland, and
Australia estimate the incidence of primary cardiomyopathies to
be 1/100,000 person-years in children <20 years of age (11, 12).
Idiopathic DCM is the most common type in infants and children
(13–15), and nearly 40% of children with symptoms, despite
medical therapy, can develop progressive heart failure that may
need lead to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) or death within
the first 2 years after diagnosis (11). Transplant-free survival
in patients at 1 and 5 years is reported to be ∼70 and 60%,
respectively (13, 14).
Management of ESHF in infants and children is a challenging
problem. Children with ESHF who cannot be stabilized with
medical therapy can be supported effectively with MCS to unload
the failing ventricle and maintain end-organ perfusion, (16, 17)
as bridge to transplant or bridge to recovery.
Although some innovative centrifugal intrathoracic pumps
have been successfully used in teenagers, (18) owing to
dimensional restrictions, options for infants and smaller children
remain limited to external devices, such as ECMO for short-term

support, and extracorporeal VAD for long-term support, such as
the Berlin Heart EXCORR
. Despite improved results through
the years, invalidating VAD-related complications are still not
infrequent (8). There is still an increased risk of infections
and thromboembolic and bleeding events, which can potentially
result in permanent neurological dysfunction or death, (16, 19)

and local infection of the cables or the cannula insertion sites,
which are extremely painful for the children and frustrating for
caregivers. Furthermore, despite improved survival of children
with ESHF, VAD utilization continues to have a prolonged ICU
and hospital stay, waiting for a transplant or rarely recovery,
which deteriorates the quality of life of patients and their families.
Despite the improvement in the medical management of
ESHF patients, with the increased use of VAD and decreased
frequency of rejection during the first year post-transplant, life
after transplant is not easy, with a survival rate of about 90%
1 year after transplant and with overall 25-year survival of
37%, (20) which makes cardiac transplantation an unappealing
option for a child. Last but not least, it is well-known that
the incidence of neoproliferative diseases such as lymphoma or
leukemia remains high in children after transplant, (21) limiting
the effectiveness of HT in pediatric age.
Pulmonary Artery Banding for Myocardial
Rehabilitation
PAB is an old surgical technique described a long time ago as a
palliative surgical procedure for CHD with pulmonary overflow.
Despite the fact that early repair is currently the gold standard,
PAB remains a valid option to balance pulmonary and systemic
circulation in several complex CHD (9).
Based on previous experience derived from re-training of
the subpulmonary left ventricle before anatomical correction in
congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
or before arterial switch for dextro-TGA (D-TGA), (22–25) PAB
has been applied to treat ESHF in children with DCM and
preserved right ventricle function (26).
The first report of such application of PAB was published
by the Giessen group in 2007 (27). The effectiveness of such a
treatment in 12 patients was reported later by Schranz et al. (1, 28)
as well as other groups over the past years (29, 30). A recent
multicenter study has confirmed these promising outcomes in 70
patients worldwide (9).
The mechanism underlying the improvement of left ventricle
function by right ventricle pressure overload induced by PAB
is still uncertain. Most researchers believe that PAB causes a
leftward shift of the interventricular septum that can reduce
left ventricle dimensions, change its shape from spherical to
ellipsoid morphology, and finally reduce the mitral valve annular
dilatation and consequently mitral regurgitation, with the result
of optimizing volume overload. Additionally, the PAB induces a
favorable change in the Frank–Starling curve, and the reduction
in left ventricle preload and end-diastolic/end-systolic filling
pressures may enable a more favorable hemodynamic state
and improvement of LVEF. Third, the PAB may determine an
increase in right ventricle contractility (Anrep effect) and can
stimulate its hypertrophy, matrix remodeling, and regenerative
capacity of a young heart (31). Last but not least, PAB
may enhance biological crosstalk between the right and left
ventricles (i.e., the change in biventricular gene expression) that
causes left ventricle reverse remodeling (co-hypertrophy) by
favoring endogenous repair potential and can ultimately restore
electromechanical right–left ventricle synchrony.
Some of these post-PAB effects have been partially described
in a retrospective study based on cardiac MRI analysis presurgery
and post-surgery of 15 children with DCM. This paper (31)
showed that PAB leads to recovery of left ventricle size and
global pump function, accompanied by improved left ventricle
systolic strain, diastolic function, and intraventricular and
interventricular synchrony. The right ventricle response to PAB
consisted of a rise in mass with an increase in strain, associated
with a leftward mechanical shift of the interventricular septum.
Improved left ventricle echocardiographic function and
dimensions after PAB have been reported even in the setting
of an experimental model of doxorubicin-induced left ventricle
DCM (32). Despite all these exciting findings and data, we need
further experimental work to elucidate the underlying molecular
mechanism of this innovative strategy.
Our Experience
Since 2015, we have applied the Giessen methodology to treat
ESHF in selected infants and children. Our initial experience
with PAB for ESHF has resulted in being an effective strategy to
avoid or postpone HT in infants with DCM and preserved right
ventricular function. Our population, despite small in number, is
comparable in terms of age with that reported by the experience
of other centers worldwide. We also report comparable data in
terms of in-hospital and ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation
time after surgery (9).
In four out of five patients, PAB showed to have an immediate
effect in supporting left ventricle function, by the acute increase
in right ventricle pressure. Mechanical remodeling, such as
ventricular septum shift to the left, with a change in the shape
of the left ventricle and a decrease in its preload and mitral valve
regurgitation, was observed immediately after PAB. Besides, we
found a significant and dramatic increase of LVEF and a decrease
of LVEDD and blood level of BNP/pro-BNP at follow-up in those
three patients who did not require a transplant.
It is of note that those patients, who initially responded
positively to PAB (4/5 patients), presented a very different and
complex clinical post-operative course. Two patients (1 and
4) experienced acute heart failure during pneumonia. Whereas
patient #1 (DCM in non-compaction cardiomyopathy), owing
to distance from our center, was urgently admitted to another
hospital and underwent MCS and HT, patient #4 (chronic
myocarditis) was treated successfully in our hospital with
the intravenous infusion of inotropic medications. A similar
clinical problem occurred in patient #3 (acute myocarditis),
who presented a late acute deterioration of cardiac function,
without any infectious cause, and required hospitalization with
infusion of inotropic agents. On the contrary, patient #5 (acute
myocarditis) has had an uneventful post-operative course and
could be discharged to his country of origin.
We suggest that a very close clinical and therapeutic follow￾up (weekly evaluation and TTE assessment) is necessary for the
first months after PAB, to avoid acute left ventricle deterioration
due to common pediatric problems (i.e., pneumonia). The reason
for this is uncertain, but we speculate that it is due to the slow
regeneration process of cardiomyocytes, which requires time for
a satisfactory myocardial recovery.

FIGURE 4 | End-diastolic images from apical four-chamber view of patients #3 (1), #4 (2), and #5 (3) acquired at admission (a), immediately after PAB procedure (b),
and at the last follow-up (c), respectively. The gradual improvement of left atrium and ventricle dilation is highlighted; it is of note that it is already evident immediately
after PAB.
It is of note that patient #2 did not benefit at all of the PAB,
and despite changed intracardiac mechanics (showed by daily
TTE monitoring), the clinical condition and cardiac function
did not improve. Unlike the other patients, he was the only
patient older than 1 year of life (3.5 years) and had an extremely
compromised hemodynamic state on admission in our center
(sedated and intubated after a cardiogenic shock). Also, he was
the only one who presented with a very dilated left atrium
compressing the main left stem bronchus and causing air
entrapment and lung damage. Owing to this, he underwent
PAB with associated atrial septectomy and ECMO support.
Despite weaning from ECMO, there was no improvement in
cardiac function, and he finally underwent VAD support and HT.
Because the presence of a dilated left atrium may be the evidence
of a long-lasting myocardial dysfunction before the onset of
symptoms, we speculate that this particular patient might have
acute myocarditis on an undetected idiopathic DCM. Thus, the
long-lasting myocardial damage may have prevented a positive
effect of PAB.
On the other hand, this failure might be due to a reduced
regenerative myocardial capacity, which is known to correlate
negatively with patients’ age (33). Currently, two models describe
that human infants and children generate new cardiomyocytes,
with cardiomyocyte generation being highest in infancy, and
declining to a relative stagnation in adults, with very low but
measurable levels after 20 years of life (34–37). Even in adults,
an adjustable PAB may be able to induce in selected patients a
slower but effective improvement of sub-pulmonary left ventricle
function, as described by our group in one 20-year-old lady with
S/P Mustard in TGA (22).
On the basis of these data, we postulate that the potential
for cardiomyocyte recovery and hyperplasia/repopulation may
be the most significant in infancy, as elsewhere stated (34).
Most patients in our study are < 12 months of age. In the
long term, PAB can reduce the ischemic-necrotizing injury
of the left ventricle using a slow, gradual compensatory
mechanism. Whether this process is due to vicariant viable
myocyte hypertrophy or to circulating stem cells, myocardial
repopulation is not guaranteed. However, it is widely known
and accepted that in the first months of life, there are plenty
of circulating multipotent stem cells in the blood circulation.
Because the histological evaluation of human heart after
successful PAB would be useful scientifically, but ethically
contraindicated, we suggest to repeat MRI periodically to identify

fibrotic areas or viable myocardium to evaluate myocardial
disease recovery.
In our experience, the PAB procedure presents some crucial
advantages. First of all, it is a simple surgical procedure,
which does not require cardiopulmonary bypass, and can be
tolerated hemodynamically by the patients as long as continuous
echocardiographic monitoring is assured. Furthermore, there is
the possibility to modulate PAB tightness both in the immediate
post-operative period (by delayed chest closure) and by graded
percutaneous balloon dilation of the band in the follow-up (when
PAB is too narrow with high gradient trans-PAB and tricuspid
regurgitation increases owing to right ventricle dilation). In fact,
in our series, the last three patients underwent percutaneous
balloon de-banding to preserve the right ventricle function.
Third, when compared with VAD surgery, PAB is easier and less
invasive. It does not require left ventricle apicectomy (for the
VAD inflow cannula), which may jeopardize the left ventricle
function recovery, as suggested by some studies focused on
muscle layer contractility and the pivotal role of the left ventricle
apex (38). Last, after successful PAB, the patient can be managed
in the ward, mobilized, and discharged home with weekly
hospital evaluations; and the infective and thromboembolic
complications, which may occur during MCS, are minimized as
well by PAB strategy.
In our experience, in four patients, the gradual clinical
improvement and functional left ventricle recovery offered a
chance for discharge home. Most importantly, three among
five reached complete LVEF normalization (Figure 4), average
somatic growth, and neuropsychological development out of
the hospital, and they experienced such a dramatic progressive
clinical improvement that allowed us to remove them from
HT list.
Our study cannot clarify if PAB-induced cardiac remodeling
was only a modality of transient support of the ventricular
function in a framework of myocarditis that would
have undergone a spontaneous resolution, or if it had a
pathophysiological role (partial or more consistent) in the
cardiomyopathy complete recovery. However, it certainly
avoided that four among five patients would undergo a more
invasive approach in the acute phase (such as MCS or, in extreme
cases, emergent HT).
We conclude that PAB strategy has provided these children a
possibility of complete remission without damaging irreversibly
the cardiac structures or great vessels and an option to have a
healthy life expectancy after recovery, without the drawbacks of
life-lasting immunosuppressive therapy.
Limitations
The significant limitations are the small number of patients
and the short follow-up time, which prevents long-term cardiac
function assessment.
CONCLUSIONS
The introduction of PAB may represent a paradigmatic change
in managing pediatric ESHF. In our experience, PAB resulted in
an effective and affordable procedure with acceptable risk and
convincing medium-term outcomes. We believe this strategy can
be a valid option in selected infants and children with ESHF,
as an alternative strategy to MCS for bridging to transplant
or, hopefully, cardiac recovery. In our series, better results
occurred in patients aged < 12 months, probably owing to a
preserved myocardial regenerative potential. However, the early
post-operative period can be extremely challenging, and serious
complications may be caused by transient diseases typical of
infancy. Thus, the PAB strategy requires strict clinical follow￾up and frequent hospital admissions and evaluations. Further
experience and research are required to differentiate between
“responder” and “non-responder” patients to this innovative
heart failure therapy.
