Abstract
A 35-year-old man developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with severe neutropenia after umbili￾cal cord stem cell transplantation for chronic myelogeneous leukemia. Filamentous fungus isolated from his
sputum was identified as Aspergillus terreus. Despite systemic amphotericin B (AMPH) administration, IPA
progressed. However, intravenous administration of micafungin (MCFG) and oral itraconazole improved
clinical data and symptoms, although he later died of massive hemoptysis. Examination of the in vitro sus￾ceptibility of this A. terreus isolate to MCFG revealed a good minimum inhibitory concentration and good
time-kill assay results compared to AMPH. Thus, MCFG might be useful for IPA caused by A. terreus.

Introduction
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) caused by infec￾tion with the filamentous fungus Aspergillus is the major in￾fectious complication in transplant recipients and patients
with prolonged neutropenia (1). The approximately 200 As￾pergillus species consist of widespread molds, of which only
a few are known to be human pathogens. Aspergillus fumi￾gatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger are the most
commonly encountered species, but other species, such as
Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus clavatus, Aspergillus niveus
and Aspergillus nidulans have rarely been reported to cause
disease in humans (2). According to recent studies, effort
should be made to distinguish A. terreus from other Asper￾gillus species, as it often has in vitro and in vivo resistance
to standard treatment using amphotericin B (AMPH) (3-
12).
Here, we report a case of IPA caused by A. terreus con￾comitant with chronic myelogeneous leukemia. We also
evaluated the in vitro response of this A. terreus isolate to
the antifungal agent micafungin (MCFG), which has a novel
mechanism of action. Our results suggest that MCFG is a
useful antifungal agent for IPA caused by A. terreus.
Case Report
A 35-year-old man was admitted to hospital in August
2003 with low grade fever and general fatigue. Physical ex￾amination confirmed non-tender marked splenomegaly. Rou￾tine complete blood count disclosed slight anemia (hemoglo￾bin, 9.5 g/dl) and an increased leukocyte count (480,000/
μl). The patient was diagnosed with accelerated phase
chronic myelogeneous leukemia with the Philadelphia chro￾mosome. Imatinib and hydroxylurea administration failed to
achieve a cytogenetic response. He then underwent unrelated
umbilical cord stem cell transplantation (UCSCT) in January
2004. During the 50 days after UCSCT, he showed severe
neutropenia (<100/μl) and was therefore diagnosed with
graft failure. He then underwent allogeneic bone marrow

transplantation (BMT) from a 2-HLA antigen-mismatched
related donor in March 2004. Chest X-ray revealed a new
nodular shadow in the right lung field just after BMT
(Fig. 1). He was suspected of having IPA because filamen￾tous fungi was isolated from his sputum without other
pathogens and the optical density index of serum Aspergillus
galactomannan antigen became positive (>5.0). Although he
received systemic AMPH at 1 mg/kg per day via injection,
the nodule shadow on the X-ray changed to infiltrated shad￾ows with another new filtrated shadow appearing in the left
lung field. We therefore decided to treat this patient with in￾travenous administration of micafungin (MCFG) (300 mg
per day) and itraconazole (ITCZ) capsules (200 mg per
day), in addition to administration of AMPH. On the 22nd
day after BMT, his peripheral white blood cell count had re￾covered to >1,000/μl. At this time, chest X-ray showed the
air-crescent sign within the infiltration shadow in the right
middle lung field (Fig. 2). The antifungal agents appeared to
be effective as there was a decrease in C reactive protein
from 28.1 mg/dl to 3.6 mg/dl, improvement in his symp￾toms and a decrease in the optical density index of his se￾rum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen to 4.4. Conse￾quently, the antifungal combination therapy of AMPH,
MCFG and ITCZ was continued. However, the patient died
of massive hemoptysis on the 32nd day after BMT. Autopsy
was refused by his relatives.
A culture of his sputum on Sabouraud glucose agar
yielded Aspergillus, which was identified as A. terreus after
the patient’s death. The colonies of this fungus were
cinnamon-brown in color on Sabouraud glucose agar and
microscopically the colonies had long slender conidiophores
and dome-like vesicles with biseriate and columnar conidial
heads, consistent with A. terreus (Fig. 3).
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of anti￾fungal agents against A. terreus were determined by broth
microdilution as described by the National Committee for
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M-38P protocol
(13). The MIC of AMPH was 1 μg/ml; flucytosine, 64 μg/
ml; fluconazole: >64 μg/ml; miconazole, 0.125 μg/ml; ITCZ,
0.03 μg/ml and MCFG, 0.015 μg/ml. The A. terreus isolated
from the patient was most susceptible to MCFG, and the
data suggested that this isolate is also susceptible to AMPH
and ITCZ in vitro.
We next performed a time-kill assay using AMPH and
MCFG against this isolate according to the method of Walsh
et al (3). An inoculum of 1.0×106 conidia/ml of A. terreus

isolate was incubated in Sabouraud dextrose broth plus anti￾fungal compound using antifungal concentrations of 0.25, 1,
2, and 4 times the MIC of each antifungal agent in polypro￾pylene tubes at 37℃ Samples were taken from each tube at
0, 6 and 24 h after incubation and these samples were then
cultured on Sabouraud glucose agar at 37℃ for 24 h. Colo￾nies were counted and the calculated colony-forming units
per milliliter were plotted for each time point (Fig. 4). None
of the AMPH concentrations showed any fungicidal activity
against the A. terreus isolate. Moreover, at 24 h, an increase
in conidia of the isolate was observed. By comparison, for
MCFG, A. terreus demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in vi￾able colony forming units by 24 h at 0.015 μg/dl MCFG.
Discussion
A review of 1,477 separate Aspergillus-positive cultures
from 24 medical centers in the United States found that A.
fumigatus was the most frequently isolated Aspergillus spe￾cies, causing 67% of invasive aspergillosis cases (14). A. fla￾vus accounted for 16% of invasive aspergillosis followed by
A. niger (5%) and A. terreus (3%). According to a report
from Spain, A. terreus was the second most common spe￾cies, after A. fumigatus, recovered from respiratory speci￾mens (38 of 247 isolates; 15.4%) (15). Furthermore, a re￾cent review of the literature revealed an increasing number
of reported cases of infection caused by A. terreus (3-12).
Walsh et al suggested that this phenomenon might be related
to an increasing number of immunocompromised patients at

risk of developing invasive fungal infection (3). They also
noted that empirical or prophylactic use of AMPH in high￾risk patients may be another factor contributing to the selec￾tion of AMPH-resistant strains of A. terreus. Baddley et al
reported that the percentage of A. terreus isolates relative to
those of other Aspergillus species had significantly increased
at the University of Alabama hospital (4). However, molecu￾lar genotyping of isolates showed no evidence of noso￾comial A. terreus infection in that hospital. Lass-Florl et al
suggested in their molecular epidemiological study that the
onset of A. terreus infection might depend on exposure to
environmental Aspergillus species, such as from in-hospital
plants (5, 6). In Japan, we have found no epidemiologic re￾ports on the incidence of infectious diseases caused by A.
terreus.
Numerous previous reports have warned that A. terreus
might be resistant to AMPH, the standard drug for IPA (3-
12). For instance, a previous detailed study showed that
AMPH had excellent in vitro activity against A. fumigatus
(96% inhibited at an MIC of 1 μg/ml), whereas AMPH
against A. terreus demonstrated poor in vitro activity (38%
inhibited at an MIC of 1 μg/ml) (7). The antifungal clini￾cal breakpoint of antifungal agents for filamentous fungi
was not clear. However a retrospective analysis of contem￾porary clinical data reported that A. terreus infection was re￾sistant to AMPH and associated with a high rate of mortal￾ity (8).
Walsh et al. showed by time-kill assay that A. terreus is
more resistant to the fungicidal effects of AMPH than A. fu￾migatus (3). Furthermore, they demonstrated that AMPH
had no effect in cleaning fungi from lung tissue in an ani￾mal model using rabbits infected with A. terreus, whereas
AMPH achieved a significant reduction in the residual bur￾den in the lungs of rabbits infected with A. fumigatus. In an￾other study, Warn et al. showed that the treatment of A. ter￾reus infection with MCFG significantly prolonged the sur￾vival of an experimental mouse model compared to liposo￾mal AMPH (9). The survival rates were 20% with liposo￾mal AMPH (5 and 25 mg/kg), but MCFG treatment showed
a clear dose-dependent response with 60%, 80%, 90% and
100% survival after 1, 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg respectively.
These results indicate that MCFG may play a clinically im￾portant role in the treatment of A. terreus infections.
We evaluated in vitro antifungal efficacy against our A.
terreus isolate using MIC and time-kill assays. The MIC of
AMPH against this isolate was 1 μg/ml, which was thought
to indicate susceptibility to this agent. However, the time￾kill assay demonstrated no fungicidal activity at up to 4
times the MIC concentration of AMPH against this A. ter￾reus isolate. Thus, a reliable in vitro method of assessing the
activity of antifungal agents against filamentous fungi is re￾quired to replace MIC. On the other hand, MCFG showed
good antifungal activity against A. terreus on both the MIC
and time-kill assays. As reported previously, the new anti￾fungal agent ‘echinocandin’, including MCFG and caspo￾fungin, has in vitro and in vivo efficacy against A. terreus
(6, 7, 9, 10), and thus MCFG should be a useful agent
against this type of infection.
In the present case, we administered AMPH immediately
after diagnosis of IPA, but the IPA worsened clinically. Al￾though the addition of MCFG and ITCZ improved the clini￾cal data and symptoms, the patient unfortunately died of
massive hemoptysis. The meniscus sign developed during
the clinical course of IPA when the neutrophil count had in￾creased to >500 cells/μl, which has been shown to be sug￾gestive of a high risk of large scale hemoptysis (16).
New triazoles, such as posaconazole and voriconazole,
have been reported to have good antifungal activity against
A. terreus in vitro (3, 6-8). Clinically, voriconazole has also
been reported to be effective against IPA caused by A. ter￾reus (11); unfortunately, it was not available in Japan at the
time of the present case. The results of in vitro examination,
which we later performed, suggested that IPA in this case
was improved by the use of MCFG. In addition, recovery
from the neutropenia, which was a factor in hemoptysis,
would contribute to improvement of infectious disease. Ab￾sorption of ITCZ encapsulated formulation depends on gas￾tric acid secretion. In a patient that has not taken a meal, ab￾sorption of ITCZ into the bloodstream is low (17). After
IPA onset, the present patient had no appetite. Although the
plasma concentration of ITCZ was not measured in this
case, it is thought that the plasma concentration of ITCZ in
this patient was low. Therefore, it is doubtful that ITCZ had
an effect on IPA in this case.
The present case and our study suggest the importance of
identifying the exact species causing invasive aspergillosis
for best selection of adapted antifungal agents. In the case
of A. terreus, MCFG or new triazoles should be used, and
not AMPH.
