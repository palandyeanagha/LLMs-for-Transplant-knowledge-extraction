Abstract
Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD-III), an autosomal
recessive disease, is caused by deficient glycogen debranch￾ing enzyme (GDE) activity. Most GSD-III patients are
GDE deficient in both liver and muscle (type IIIa), and
some GSD-III patients have GDE absent in liver but re￾tained in muscle (type IIIb). The molecular basis for this en￾zymatic variability is largely unknown. In the present study,
the analysis of the GDE gene in three GSD-IIIb patients by
single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), DNA
sequencing, restriction analysis, and family studies, re￾vealed each of them as being a compound heterozygote for
two different mutations. The first mutant alleles in all three
patients involved mutations in exon 3 at amino acid codon 6
of the GDE protein. Two had an AG deletion at nucleotides
17 and 18 of the GDE cDNA (17delAG) which resulted in
change of subsequent amino acid sequence and a truncated
protein (25X); the other had a C to T transition at nucle￾otide 16 of the cDNA which changed a Glutamine codon to
a stop codon (Q6X). The 17delAG mutation was also found
in 8 of the 10 additional GSD-IIIb patients. The Q6X muta￾tion was found in one of the remaining two GSD-IIIb pa￾tients. These two mutations were not found in any of the 31
GSD-IIIa patients, 2 GSD-IIId patients, nor 28 unrelated
normal controls. The second mutant alleles in each of the
three GSD-IIIb patients were R864X, R1228X, and W680X.
The R864X and R1228X were not unique for GSD-IIIb as
they were also found in GSD-IIIa patients (frequency of
10.3% and 5.2% in Caucasian patients, respectively). Our
data demonstrated that both IIIa and IIIb had mutations in
the same GDE gene and established for the first time the
molecular basis of GSD-III that differentially expressed in
liver and muscle. The striking and specific association of
exon 3 mutations with GSD-IIIb may provide insight into
mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of the
GDE gene. The identification of exon 3 mutations has clini￾cal significance as well because it distinguished GSD-IIIb
from IIIa hence permitting diagnosis from a blood sample
rather than a more invasive muscle biopsy. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE),1
 together with phos￾phorylase is responsible for degradation of glycogen. The
GDE is a 174-kD monomeric protein, with both amylo-1,6-
glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33) and 1,4-a-D-glucan 4-a-D-glycosyl￾transferase (EC 2.4.1.25) activities at two independent cata￾lytic sites (1, 2). Deficiency of GDE activity causes glycogen
storage disease type III (GSD-III), an autosomal recessive dis￾ease, characterized by hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, short
stature, and in many patients myopathy and cardiomyopathy
(3). The variable phenotype is explained by differences in tis￾sue expression of the defective enzyme. Most commonly the
enzyme is deficient in both liver and muscle (GSD type IIIa).
However sometimes GDE is only deficient in liver and activity
in muscle is normal (type IIIb). In rare cases, selective loss of
only one of the two DE activities (glucosidase [type IIIc], or
transferase [type IIId]) has been demonstrated (4, 5).
We and others have isolated the GDE gene and deter￾mined its cDNA sequences (6, 7). The GDE gene mRNA con￾sists of a 4596-bp coding region and a 2371-bp 39-nontranslated
region. The human gene is localized to chromosome 1p21 (8).
The genomic structure of the human GDE gene has been de￾termined and consists of 35 exons spanning at least 85 kb of
DNA. Analysis of the cDNA sequences and genomic structure
indicated that the GDE gene in liver and muscle is encoded by
a single gene. The liver and muscle GDE isoform mRNAs are
identical except for the sequence present in the 59-nontrans￾lated region (9, 10; Bao et al., manuscript submitted for publi￾cation). 
The molecular basis of GSD-III and the mechanisms deter￾mining the tissue-specific expression of the GDE gene are
largely unknown. It has not been understood how one gene,
normally expressed in all tissues, can change the expression in
different tissues. The presence of patients with defective en￾zyme that is differentially expressed in liver and muscle make
GSD-III an ideal model to study tissue-specific gene expression. 
We recently reported the first pathogenic mutation in
GSD-IIIa: an insertion mutation (4529insA) in a child with an
unusually severe phenotype (11). In this report we focus our
study on GSD-IIIb. We have demonstrated a striking and spe￾cific association of mutations in exon 3 of the GDE gene with
these patients. This finding for the first time establishes the
molecular basis of glycogen storage disease type III that is dif￾ferentially expressed in liver and muscle.

Mutations in Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIIb 353
Methods
Patients. Our study group included 46 patients with glycogen storage
disease type III, for whom both biochemical analysis and clinical data
were available; 22 patients were identified through the diagnostic fa￾cility for study of glycogen storage disease at Duke University Medi￾cal Center, 21 patients were followed at Great Ormond Street Hospi￾tal for Children in London, UK, and additional 3 patients’ skin
fibroblasts were obtained from NIGMS, Human Genetic Mutant Cell
Repository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research (cell line numbers:
GM00576, GM2523, and GM3390). Glycogen storage disease type III
was diagnosed by demonstrating deficient debranching enzyme activ￾ity in liver, muscle or mixed leukocytes (or in some patients in more
than one tissue) with phosphorylase-limit dextrin used as the sub￾strate (12). In those patients who had not had a muscle biopsy, muscle
involvement was inferred from very high activity of plasma creatine
kinase (over 33 upper limit of normal). Blood or skin fibroblasts
were the source of genomic DNA isolation.
Mutations were studied in detail in three GSD-IIIb patients (pa￾tients 1–3). Data on biochemical analysis and clinical information in
these patients have been previously reported (13), debranching en￾zyme activity was absent in the liver specimen but normal in the mus￾cle specimen. These three patients are now at the age of 25 years (patient
1), 18 years (patient 2), and 41 years (patient 3), and continue to show
no clinical or laboratory evidence of myopathy or cardiomyopathy. 
Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The primers
in Table I were used to amplify the coding regions of exon 3 (primers
1 and 2), exon 17 (primers 3 and 4), exon 21 (primers 5 and 6), and
exon 28 (primers 7 and 8) of the GDE gene. The DNA fragments
were labeled by addition of 0.25 ml of a￾32P dCTP (3,000 Ci mmol21
,
10 mCi ml
21
) into each 25 ml of PCR reaction. One microliter of each
PCR amplified sample was taken out and added into 10 ml of stop so￾lution (95% formamide, 10 mM NaOH, 0.25% bromophenol blue,
and 0.25% Xylene cyanol). The sample was denatured for 5 min in a
boiling water bath and placed immediately on ice. 2.5 ml of each sam￾ple was then loaded onto one or two types of gels: 1) 0.75 3 MDE gel
(AT Biochemicals, Malvern, PA) containing 5% (vol/vol) glycerol; 2)
0.75 3 MDE gel without glycerol. The gels were electrophoresed at
6–8 W either at room temperature for 18 h (h) or at 48C for 36 h. The
gels were dried on 3 MM Whatman paper and exposed to Kodak
Biomax MR film at 2808C.
DNA sequencing. With the SSCP analysis, potential mutations
were localized to specific exons within regions of 150–360 bp. To
identify the mutations at the nucleotide level, direct sequencing of
PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragments without subcloning was per￾formed with the AmpliCycle™ Sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer, Foster
City, CA) using g￾32P dATP (3,000 Ci mmol21
, 10 mCi ml
21
). The
same PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragments were also subcloned
into pCR™ II vector with the TA cloning kit (InVitrogen, San Diego,
CA). Plasmid DNA was isolated, alkaline denatured, and mixed with
one original PCR primer, then annealed, and sequenced with Seque￾nase 2.0 (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) using [35S] dATP. Ei￾ther one or both strands were sequenced with the sequencing primers
used in SSCP.
Restriction analysis. Restriction analysis was performed to en￾sure identified mutations were not PCR artifacts, and to provide a
rapid screening for mutation in other patients and family members.
Genomic DNA containing each of the suspected mutations was am￾plified by PCR using a different set of primers. The primers were also
listed in Table I. The amplified fragments were digested with their
specific restriction enzymes: (a) fragments amplified from exon 3 (us￾ing primers 9 and 10) digested with either HinfI for the 17delAG mu￾tation or HincII for the Q6X mutation; (b) fragments amplified from
exon 17 (using primers 11 and 12) digested with DraIII; (c) fragments
amplified from exon 21 (using primers 13 and 14) digested with
a-TaqI; and (d) fragments amplified from exon 28 (using primers 15
and 16) digested with DpnII. The digested samples were then electro￾phoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. All the restriction enzymes
used were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
Results
Screening mutations with SSCP
Mutations were studied in detail in three GSD-IIIb patients
(patients 1–3). 35 pairs of PCR primers were designed so that
they amplified the 59-nontranslated region as well as coding re￾gions of each of the 35 exons, and all intron–exon junctions, of
the GDE gene. The primers used to amplify exons 3, 17, 21,
and 28 were listed in Table I. SSCP analysis on MDE gels was
followed to detect mobility shift in GSD-III patients. There

was a two allele polymorphism in exon 3 of these patients and
unrelated normal controls. DNA sequencing showed that the
polymorphism is due to G to A change in 59-nontranslated re￾gion of exon 3 (210G/A). In addition to the polymorphism,
two unique SSCP patterns were also seen in this exon, which
represented samples from GSD-IIIb patients (patients 1 and
3). 10 GSD-IIIa patients and one GSD-IIId patient did not
have a mobility shift in exon 3 other than those created by
210G/A polymorphism (data not shown). 
Further SSCP studies of each of the three GSD-IIIb pa￾tients showed additional mobility shifts in (a) exon 21 of pa￾tient 1; (b) exon 28 of patient 2; and (c) exon 17 of patient 3.
These exons were sequenced. 
Identification of mutations
Patient 1. Sequencing of subclones of patient 1 in exon 3
showed two base pairs adenine and guanine deletion at nucle￾otides 17 and 18 of the GDE cDNA (17delAG) (Fig. 1 A),
which changed the subsequent amino acid sequence and re￾sulted in a stop codon 56 bp down stream in the same exon (25X).
The mutation appeared to be heterozygous because only 4 of
the 8 subclones sequenced contained the deletion and the
other 4 were normal. Direct sequencing showed the AG dele￾tion and a duplicate banding pattern in nucleotides after the
deletion confirming the heterozygous nature of the mutation.
The AG deletion (17delAG) abolished an HinfI restriction
enzyme site. Using primers 9 and 10 (Table I), a 57-bp frag￾ment of genomic DNA containing the suspected mutation was
amplified. After HinfI digestion, the 57-bp fragment was com￾pletely digested into two fragments (35 and 22 bp) in a normal
control (lane 1, Fig. 1 B) but was only partially digested in pa￾tient 1 (lane 2, Fig. 1 B). The pattern of restriction analysis fur￾ther indicated that patient 1 was heterozygous for the
17delAG mutation and family study indicated that he inher￾ited the deletion from his mother (lane 4, Fig. 1 B). The father
and his sister were normal at this position.
An additional SSCP mobility shift in patient 1 was seen in
exon 21. Sequencing of subclones of patient 1 in exon 21
showed a C to T transition at the position 2590 of the GDE
cDNA (2590C→T) (data not shown), which changed an Argi￾nine codon to a stop codon (R864X). (Our recent data indicate
that there are 17 additional amino acids preceding the NH2
 ter￾minus of the published GDE sequence [6]. The nucleotide
2590 and amino acid 864 designated here, correspond to the
published sequence of nucleotide 2539 and amino acid 847, re￾spectively.) The nonsense mutation appeared to be heterozy￾gous because (a) three of the 6 subclones sequenced were mu￾tant and (b) the mutation produced both C and T bands at the
same position when PCR products were directly sequenced.
The R864X (C→T) mutation eliminated an a-TaqI restric￾tion enzyme site. Using primers 11 and 12 (Table I), an 83-bp
fragment containing the suspected mutation was amplified.
After a-TaqI digestion, the 83-bp fragment was completely di￾gested into two fragments (50 and 33 bp) in a normal control
but was only partially digested in patient 1. The pattern of re￾striction analysis further indicated that patient 1 was heterozy￾gous for the R864X (C→T) mutation and he inherited the
point mutation from his father. The sister was not a carrier for
either AG deletion or point mutation (data not shown).
Patient 2. Patient 2 had an exon 3 SSCP pattern similar to
that of patient 1. Direct sequencing of the PCR amplified ge￾nomic DNA from patient 2 showed the same AG deletion at
nucleotides 17 and 18 of the GDE cDNA (17delAG) as pa￾tient 1 (data not shown). Patient 2, however, was homozygous
for G at polymorphic site 210G/A. Direct sequencing also
showed the 17delAG mutation produced duplicate bands in
nucleotides after the deletion. This result together with six of
the 12 subclones sequenced containing the deletion indicated
that the 17delAG mutation in patient 2 was heterozygous.
Restriction analysis using the same method for patient 1
confirmed that patient 2 was a heterozygote for the AG dele￾tion. The mother of patient 2 was normal at this position, how￾ever, the biological father was not available for study.

change was indicated. (B) HinfI restriction enzyme digestion of PCR￾amplified genomic DNA fragments in family of patient 1. Digestion

Mutations in Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIIb 355
An additional SSCP mobility shift in patient 2 was found in
exon 28. Sequencing of subclones of patient 2 in exon 28
showed a C to T transition at position 3682 of the GDE cDNA
(3682C→T) (data not shown), which changed an Arginine
codon to a stop codon (R1228X). The nonsense mutation ap￾peared to be heterozygous because (a) three of the 6 subclones
sequenced were mutant and (b) the change produced both C
and T bands at the same position when PCR products were di￾rectly sequenced.
The R1228X (C→T) mutation abolished a DpnII restric￾tion enzyme site. Using primers 13 and 14 (Table I), a 73-bp
fragment containing the suspected mutation was amplified.
After DpnII digestion, the 73-bp fragment was completely di￾gested into two fragments (42 and 31 bp) in a normal control
but was only partially digested in patient 2. The pattern of re￾striction analysis further indicated that patient 2 was heterozy￾gous for the R1228X (C→T) mutation and he inherited this
point mutation from his mother (data not shown).
Patient 3. Patient 3 had a unique exon 3 SSCP pattern. Se￾quencing of subclones of patient 3 revealed a C to T transition
at the position 16 of the GDE cDNA (16C→T) (data not
shown), which changed a Glutamine codon to a stop codon
(Q6X). Four of the 8 subclones sequenced were mutant, indi￾cating the change was heterozygous. 
The Q6X (C→T) nonsense mutation in patient 3 together
with the mismatch in primer 9 (Table I) eliminated an HincII
restriction enzyme site. Using primers 9 and 10 (Table I), a
57-bp fragment of genomic DNA containing the suspected
mutation was amplified. After HincII digestion, the 57-bp frag￾ment was completely digested into two fragments (40 and 17
bp) in a normal control but was only partially digested in pa￾tient 3. The pattern of restriction analysis further indicated
that patient 3 was heterozygous for the Q6X (C→T) mutation,
and family study indicated that he inherited the point mutation
from his father. The mother was normal at this position (data
not shown).
An additional SSCP mobility shift in patient 3 was found in
exon 17. Sequencing of subclones of patient 3 showed a G to A
transition at the position 2039 of the GDE cDNA (2039G→A),
which changed a Tryptophan codon to a stop codon (W680X)
(data not shown). The nonsense mutation appeared to be het￾erozygous because (a) three of the six subclones sequenced
were mutant and (b) the mutation produced both G and A
bands at the same position when PCR products were directly
sequenced.
The W680X (G→A) nonsense mutation abolished a DraIII
restriction enzyme site. The primers 15 and 16 (Table I) were
used to amplify a 67-bp fragment of genomic DNA containing
the suspected mutation. After DraIII digestion, the 67-bp frag￾ment was completely digested into 45 and 22 bp fragments in a
normal control but was only partially digested in patient 3. The
pattern of restriction analysis further indicated that patient 3
was heterozygous for the W680X (G→A) mutation. The
mother of patient 3 was heterozygous for the mutation and the
father was normal at this position (data not shown).
Exon 3 mutations in other GSD-III patients
To determine whether the 17delAG and Q6X mutations occur
in other GSD-III patients, we used restriction analysis to
screen 43 additional GSD-III patients (10 GSD-IIIb, 31 GSD￾IIIa, and 2 GSD-IIId) for the presence of these two mutations.
Eight of the 10 additional GSD-IIIb patients had the 17delAG
mutation present in the heterozygous form. None of the 31
GSD-IIIa patients, 2 GSD-IIId patients, and 28 normal con￾trols had the deletion. Q6X mutation was found in one of the
remaining 2 GSD-IIIb patients in the heterozygous form, but
not present in any of the GSD-IIIa patients, GSD-IIId pa￾tients, or the 28 normal controls.
R864X, R1228X, and W680X mutations in other GSD-III 
patients
To determine whether three point mutations (R864X in pa￾tient 1, R1228X in patient 2, and W680X in patient 3) also oc￾cur in other GSD-III patients, we used restriction analysis to
screen 43 other GSD-III patients. The R864X point mutation
was found in a heterozygous form in 3 GSD-IIIa and 2 other
GSD-IIIb patients from 29 Caucasian GSD-III patients, thus
the R864X allele accounted for 10.3% of the Caucasian GSD￾III mutant alleles. 
Using DpnII restriction enzyme to screen 43 other GSD-III
patients, the R1228X mutant allele was found in a heterozy￾gous form in 2 GSD-IIIa patients from 29 Caucasian GSD-III
patients. The frequency of this mutation among the Caucasian
GSD-III patient population was about 5.2%.
W680X appeared to be a very rare mutation as it was not
found in any of the 29 GSD-IIIa, 6 other GSD-IIIb, nor 2
GSD-IIId patients screened.
None of the 20 unrelated controls had any of these muta￾tions.
Discussion
Although the majority of patients (z 85%) with GSD-III have
GDE deficiency in both liver and muscle, with associated clini￾cal findings of hepatic dysfunction and myopathy, there are
z 15% of patients who have GDE deficiency only in liver with
the activity retained in muscle. The molecular basis for this
variability is unlikely to be due to defects in tissue-specific
isoenzymes encoded by different genes, since there is no clear
evidence for the existence of isoforms of the GDE (5, 14). It is
also unlikely to be due to defects in a transcription factor since
a single transcription factor usually affects the expression of
many genes (15). We hypothesized that the two forms of GSD￾III are caused by mutations in the same GDE structural gene.
This report provides conclusive evidence that GSD-IIIa and
IIIb represent allelic heterogeneity of the GDE gene.
Each of the three GSD-IIIb patients studied in detail was a
compound heterozygote for two different mutations. The two
mutations located on separate chromosomes in each patient
were demonstrated by the family studies. Three point muta￾tions, R864X in patient 1, R1228X in patient 2, and W680X in
patient 3, all create premature termination codons either in the
middle or in the COOH terminus of the GDE. The mutations
resulting in truncated proteins are likely to have deleterious ef￾fect on the activity, especially because the COOH terminus of
the GDE contains a putative glycogen binding domain and is
believed to be critical for the GDE activity (6). As the R864X
and R1228X mutations were also found in GSD-IIIa patients
in whom GDE is deficient in both liver and muscle, the muta￾tions must have abolished the GDE activity in both tissues, in￾dicating that the other allele accounts for the differential ex￾pression of the GDE. W680X appeared to be a very rare
mutation as it was only found in a single patient to date.
The second mutations (17delAG and Q6X) in each of the 3

356 Shen et al.
GSD-IIIb patients resided in exon 3 at amino acid codon 6
(nucleotides 16 to 18 of the GDE mRNA). Both mutations
would result in severely truncated proteins having only a few
amino acids, which would be unlikely to have GDE activity.
The exon 3 mutations were present in 12 of the 13 GSD-IIIb
patients (10 with 17delAG and 2 with Q6X), but not in any of
the 31 GSD-IIIa patients, 2 GSD-IIId patients, nor 28 unre￾lated normal controls. This striking and specific association of
exon 3 mutations with GSD-IIIb suggested that exon 3 and its
neighboring gene sequences are important in conferring the
tissue-specific expression of the GDE.
Only one of the 13 GSD-IIIb patients studied did not have
mutations in exon 3. This patient could have a mutation in the
liver-specific promoter and/or enhancer region. Analysis of
mutations in GSD-IIIb patients should provide not only a mo￾lecular basis of the disease, but also insight into mechanisms
controlling tissue-specific expression of the GDE gene.
How can the exon 3 mutations, which create premature
stop codons resulting in severely truncated proteins without
GDE activity, retain GDE activity in muscle? Liver and mus￾cle GDE isoform mRNAs are identical except for the 59-non￾translated region. Genomic structure analysis shows that these
isoform mRNAs are generated from a single gene by a com￾bined process of differential RNA transcription and process￾ing (Fig. 2). The major isoform of GDE mRNA in liver is pro￾duced by the use of exons 1 and 3. The muscle GDE mRNAs
consists of, in addition to the liver isoform, a unique muscle￾specific isoform which begins with exon 2. Exon 3, which is
common for both liver and muscle, is 150 bp in length with 68
bp of 59-nontranslated sequence, and 82 bp of coding se￾quence. Translation of GDE protein starts in this exon. Minor
isoform mRNAs with the alternative use of exon 39 or exon 49
were also observed in both liver and muscle (Fig. 2, and Bao et
al., manuscript submitted for publication). Interestingly, these
exons also contain ATG start codons with an excellent Kozak
sequence (16) in reading frame with the remaining GDE cod￾ing sequence. It is possible that because of the nonsense muta￾tions (a) translation of GDE protein begins with a downstream
ATG, (b) activation of the minor isoforms with translation
starts in exon 39 or exon 49, or (c) skipping of exon 3, with
translation starting at a downstream ATG codon. All of these
processes would result in a GDE protein which is NH2
-termi￾nally truncated. It is conceivable that a lack of the first few
NH2
-terminal amino acids in a protein as large as GDE (1532
amino acids) has little effect on the GDE activity. At present it
is not known whether activation of minor GDE isoform
mRNA and/or translation with downstream ATG codon oc￾curs in GSD-IIIb patients at all, and if it occurs, why only in
muscle but not in liver. Analysis of GDE mRNA isoforms in
muscle from patients with GSD-IIIb and expression studies
will provide critical information as to which isoforms are ex￾pressed and can also translate into a functional GDE protein;
such a muscle sample, however, is not yet available for our
analysis. 
Previous reports in other systems have documented the
presence of regulated expression of exons containing constitu￾tive stop codons. Such exons undergo sex-specific splicing in
the sex-lethal gene of Drosophila (17), developmental stage￾specific splicing in the rat glutamic acid decarboxylase gene
(18) and tissue-specific splicing in the human gene encoding
neural cell adhesion molecule (19). Nonsense mutations can
also act in cis to alter the usage of alternatively spliced se￾quences in viral RNA in murine cell (20). It is possible that the
severely truncated proteins (5– or 24–amino acid polypep￾tides) resulting from exon 3 mutations in the GDE gene play a
role in conferring the differential GDE expression in liver and
muscle. This remains to be tested.
Clinically, GSD-IIIa and GSD-IIIb have different prog￾noses and outcomes. Myopathy and cardiomyopathy will not
occur in GSD-IIIb patients, whereas, they are common in
GSD-IIIa patients, which could lead to early death or debili￾tating adult life. Although muscle involvement could be in￾Figure 2. Diagram of 59-end GDE genomic structure and major isoform mRNAs in liver and muscle. Potential ATG start codons are indicated 
as * in the diagram. Both exon 3 mutations Q6X and 17delAG are illustrated. The major isoform of GDE mRNA in liver consists of exons 1 and 
3. The muscle GDE mRNAs consists of, in addition to the liver isoform, a unique muscle-specific isoform which starts with exon 2.

Mutations in Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIIb 357
ferred from very high levels of plasma creatine kinase, the de￾finitive subtyping of GSD-III requires both liver and muscle
biopsy. The striking and specific association of exon 3 muta￾tions with GSD-IIIb could enable a molecular test for subtype
of GSD-III.
