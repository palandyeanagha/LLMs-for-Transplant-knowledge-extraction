Hepatic myelopathy is a rare complication of chronic liver disease that is associated with extensive
portosystemic shunts. The main clinical feature of hepatic myelopathy is progressive spastic paraparesis in the
absence of sensory or sphincter impairment. Early and accurate diagnosis of hepatic myelopathy is important
because patients with early stages of the disease can fully recover following liver transplantation.
Motor-evoked potential studies may be suitable for the early diagnosis of hepatic myelopathy, even in patients
with preclinical stages of the disease. Here we describe two patients who presented with spastic paraparesis
associated with a spontaneous splenorenal shunt and without any previous episode of hepatic encephalopathy.
One patient experienced improved neurologic symptoms after liver transplantation, whereas the other patient
only received medical treatment, which did not prevent the progression of spastic paraparesis. (Korean J

INTRODUCTION

Hepatic myelopathy (HM) is a rare neurolo-
gical complication of chronic liver disease that is
characterized clinically by progressive spastic
paraparesis without sphincter and sensory im-
pairment,!* Tn most reported cases, surgical por-
tosystemic shunts were present during several
months to years before symptoms of HM app-
eared, and HM is rarely found without hepatic
encephalopathy.”

This condition of the nervous system is not
easily identified, so cases of HM are likely to be
overlooked in clinical practice. However, early
and accurate diagnosis of HM is important be-
cause liver transplantation can be used to treat
patients with early stages of this disease,
whereas transplantation is less effective for later
stages of the disease.**

Here, we report two cases of cirrhosis with
HM, which was the only neurological compli-
cation, and developed after spontaneous sple-
norenal shunt. One of the patients received a
right lobe liver transplant from a living and
related donor within 6 months of the appearance
of symptoms, and the patient’s spastic para-
paresis improved slowly over the following 3
years. By contrast, the second patient only
received medical treatment aimed to reduce
ammonium production and absorption, which did
not prevent progression of spastic paraparesis.

Case 1

A 39-year-old man with cirrhosis was refer-
red to our clinic with a walking difficulty which
had developed insidiously and progressed for
about 3 months. The patient had been diagnosed
with hepatitis-B-virus-associated cirrhosis 6

months previously. When admitted to the clinic,
he was only able to walk a distance of about 5
meters with the aid of a walking stick. However,
he did not have any sphincteric or somato-
sensory impairment. His liver function was
markedly reduced and was classified as Child-
Turcotte-Pugh class C, but he had not suffered
any hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding.
There was no evidence of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, or cardiopulmonary disease. He
denied any history of alcohol or illicit drug use,
or family history of spastic paraparesis.
Neurologic examination showed the patient to
be alert and cranial nerve examination was

 

normal. His muscle tone was increased, parti-
cularly in the lower extremities, and he had an
ataxic gait. Deep tendon reflex was brisk and
plantar reflex showed an extensor response.
Lower extremity sensation was normal. There
was no evidence of sphincteric, cerebellar, or
extrapyramidal dysfunction.

The patient’s peripheral blood total white
blood cell (WBC) count was 2,500 per mm? and
platelet count was 28,000 per mm*, Prothrombin
time was 40.2% (international normalized ratio
[INR] of 2.09), serum albumin level was 2.1
g/dL, and total bilirubin was 3.8 mg/dL. Blood
ammonia level was increased to 78 lmol/L
(normal range is 10~47 umol/L), Blood electro-
lyte, urea, creatinine, and alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT) levels were all in the normal
range. A test for serum antibodies to human

 

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative.
Due to concerns over thrombocytopenia and
impaired coagulation functional status, lumbar
puncture was not performed.

A dynamic-enhanced computer tomography
(CT) scan of the abdomen revealed cirrhosis of
the liver with extensive splenorenal shunt (Fig-

ure 1). Low-grade esophageal varix was obser-
ved during endoscopic examination. Magnetic
resonance (MR) images of the cervical, thoracic
and lumbar regions of the spine did not reveal
any abnormal findings such as cord compression
or myelitis (Figure 2). Nerve conduction studies
(NCS) were normal.

Considering the clinical findings, this patient
was diagnosed as HM associated with hepatitis-
B-virus-related cirrhosis with extensive sponta-
neous splenorenal shunt. A partial liver trans-
plant was performed 3 months later using the
right hepatic lobe of a living and related donor.
After the transplant, the patient’s liver function
recovered completely within 4 weeks. There was
also slow but progressive improvement in the
spastic paraparesis, At the final follow-up visit 3
years after the transplant, the patient was able
to walk more than 100 meters unassisted, but
still had some difficulty when climbing stairs.

Case 2

A 64-year-old male with cirrhosis due to
hepatitis C virus infection was admitted to our

ogic lesions.

clinic with a 6-month history of walking diffi-
culty. Weakness of the bilateral lower extremi-
ties had developed insidiously and had pro-
gressed over several months. When admitted,
he patient could only walk about 20 meters
unassisted. The patient did not have any
difficulty in defecation or voiding, and did not
complain of any sensory symptom. In addition,
the patient had not previously suffered an
episode of hepatic encephalopathy. There was no
evidence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or
cardiopulmonary disease. He denied any history
of alcohol, illicit drug use, or family history of
spastic paraparesis.

The patient had first been assessed in our
clinic 16 months previously for the treatment of

 

a small hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor was
located in the right lobe and was 2.5 em in
diameter. The patient underwent radiofrequency
ablation, and there was no evidence of recur-
rence during the following 2-year period.

Upper-extremity strength was normal. The
patient’s muscle tone was increased, particularly
in the lower extremities with brisk deep-tendon
reflex. Plantar reflexes showed an extensor
response. Lower-extremity sensation was nor-
mal, There was no sphincter dysfunction and no
evidence of cerebellar dysfunction or any other
extrapyramidal sign.

The peripheral blood total WBC count was
2,800 per mm” and the platelet count was 83,000
per mm’. Prothrombin time was 682% (INR
1.25), albumin level was 3.2 g/dL, and total
bilirubin was 2.4 mg/dL. Blood ammonia level
was increased to 138 umol/L (normal range is
10~75 imol/L), Blood electrolyte, urea, creati-
nine, ALT, vitamin Biz, and folate levels were all
within normal limits. A test for serum antibodies
to HIV was negative. Due to concerns over
impaired coagulation status, lumbar puncture
was not performed.

Dynamic-enhanced CT of the abdomen rev-
ealed cirrhosis of the liver, extensive collaterali-
zation, and splenorenal shunt, however, there
was no evidence of a recurrence of the hepa-
tocellular carcinoma, MR imaging of the whole
spine did not reveal any abnormality, thereby
excluding the possibility of cord compression by
a metastatic tumor.

The motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were
recorded by transcranial magnetic stimulation
studies. Cortical stimulation was performed with
a coil connected to a magnetic stimulator, and
was applied to the region of the scalp overlying
the central sulcus. Magnetic stimulation of the
cervical (C7-T1) and lumbar (L4A-L5) spinal
regions was performed with the same coil. The
MEPs were recorded with the electrodes posi-
tioned on the abductor digiti minimi muscle of
the hand, and on the tibialis anterior muscle of

findings indicate motor conduction delay in the

This patient was diagnosed as HM associated
with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and
spontaneous extensive splenorenal shunt. He
‘was recommended to receive liver transplant, but
a suitable donor could not be found. During the
2-year follow-up period, the patient’s hepatic
function was conserved and there has been no
episode of hepatic encephalopathy. The motor
power of his upper extremities and his sphincter
function were also conserved. However, his spa-
stic paraparesis has progressed, and at the last
follow-up visit he was not able to stand or walk
unaided.

Discussion

Hepatic encephalopathy, which is usually rever-
sible, is a common and well-characterized neu-
rologic complication of liver cirrhosis! By con-
trast, cases of HM that are characterized by
progressive spastic paraparesis are rare, and
little is known about this condition. HM is
irreversible and refractory to many treatments
commonly used for hepatic encephalopathy,
which aim to lower plasma ammonia levels.
Most neurologists and hepatologists seem to be
unaware of this disorder, and it is a frequently
overlooked complication in patients with chronic
liver disease. Thus, HM is likely to be more
frequent than the few case reports indicate.

The diagnosis of HM should be established
clinically after exclusion of other possible
entities. An MRI scan is necessary to exclude
compression of the spinal cord or myelitis. With
the exception of an increased glutamine level,
evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid is usually
normal.’ Specific laboratory tests may be per-
formed to exclude vitamin By or folate deficien-
cies and HIV infection; although these disorders
differ markedly from HM in terms of symptoms,
and onset, and progression of the disease, The
use of an electromyography test to exclude the
possibility of second motor neuron involvement
often provides little additional information®

The symptoms shown by the patients in this
study are typical of HM: spastic paraparesis
occurred during the course of liver cirrhosis,
which is progressive and permanent. Usually,
the onset of HM is insidious and the main
clinical feature is spastic paraparesis of the
lower extremities.’ At first, the symptoms may
be slightly asymmetric, but will, as the condition
progresses, invariably affect both legs and

steadily worsen. Increased tone and hyper-
reflexia are the most common findings, and the
upper extremities are minimally affected, if at
all”? Plantar responses are usually extensor, but
flexor responses have also been described.*"°
Sensorial involvement or sphincteric impairment
are uncommon; however, these symptoms have
been reported in patients with concurrent neu-
ropathy, probably due to excessive alcohol con-
sumption.” Interestingly, almost 90% of the
reported cases are in men.’ After several mon-
ths, progression of the disease plateaus, leaving
most patients dependent on assistance or con-
fined to a wheelchair.

Unlike those in previous reports, the patients
in this study had not experienced any episodes
of hepatic encephalopathy either before or after
the occurrence of HM. In most cases, HM
symptoms develop after several bouts of hepatic
encephalopathy.” Only six patients with HM
without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy
have been described in the literature.’ In add-
ition, neither patient in this study underwent
surgical shunt formation or transjugular porto-
systemic shunt (TIPS) implantation, but both
patients had large spontaneous splenorenal

 

 

 

 

shunts. In most cases, HM symptoms begin
after the surgical implantation of a portacaval
shunt These findings have led to the assum-
ption that the incidence of HM might decrease
as shunt surgery becomes a less common pro-
cedure due to the increasing use of endoscopic
techniques in the management of esophageal or
gastric varices. Nevertheless, cases of HM are
still being reported because some cases develop
after TIPS implantation and some, like those
reported in this study, develop with spontaneous
shunting and can be referred to as cases of
‘spontaneous hepatic myelopathy’. To our know-

ledge, this study is the first report of patients
who developed HM with a spontaneous splenor-
enal shunt without any episode of hepatic ence-
phalopathy. Therefore, HM must be considered
in cirrhotic patients presenting spastic para-
paresis without previous hepatic encephalopathy
although they have not undergone surgical
portacaval shunt or TIPS.

The pathology of HM is known to mainly
involve symmetrical demyelination, predominan-
tly of the lateral pyramidal tracts, sometimes
associated with axonal loss, and which generally
occurs no higher than the cervical cord level?
The pathogenesis of HM is poorly understood.
However, it is generally accepted that portacaval
shunts, or less commonly splenorenal shunts,

even in the absence

play an important role,
of liver dysfunction. Many authors suggest that
shunting of blood may allow nitrogenous break-
down products or neurotoxins to bypass the liver
and enter the systemic circulation, resulting in
spinal cord damage. Ammonia is the molecule
most often thought to be involved." Other
authors have suggested that hemodynamic
factors of the spinal cord may be responsible
because the lesions observed are located within
spinal segments that do not have an extensive
collateral circulation.“ Nutritional deficiency may
also be related to myelopathy.® This idea is
supported by the fact that pathologic analysis of
the spinal cords of prisoners of war and patients
suffering from malnutrition are similar to those
of patients with HM. Nevertheless, it is not clear
why only a few patients with portosystemic
shunt develop myelopathy.

Clinical detection is difficult in the early
stages of HM and in patients with hepatic
encephalopathy or severe peripheral nervous
disease. The studies of the MEPs elicited by

transcranial magnetic stimulation have indicated
the involvement of the spinal cord in these
patients.” ” Unfortunately, in the first patient
(Case 1), we were unable to analyze MEP
generation before and after liver transplantation
because of a lack of the required facilities at that
time. In Case 2, the MEPs were not recorded
from the bilateral tibialis anterior muscles after
cortical stimulation, whereas they were shown to
be normal after lumbar stimulation. By contrast,

 

 

EPs that were recorded from the abductor
digiti minimi muscle were normal after both
cortical and cervical stimulation (Figure 3).
These findings indicate that the lesion is
localized between the upper thoracic and lumbar
spinal cord and are in agreement with the
findings of Nardone at al.,® who conducted MEP

studies in 13 patients with chronic liver disease

 

 

 

associated with portosystemic shunt with or
without clinical neurologic symptoms. Nardone
et al. confirmed the sensitivity of MEP studies in
detecting spinal cord dysfunction, and suggested
that MEP studies may show corticospinal elec-
trophysiologic abnormalities even at the precli-
nical stage of HM, and that these abnormalities
become more marked as the disease progresses.
Interestingly, they found that patients with early
stage disease (as shown by minor neurophy-
siologic abnormalities) experienced clear neuro-
physiologic improvement after liver transplan-
tation and an associated marked improvement in
neurologic symptoms. By contrast, the clinical
and neurophysiologic symptoms of patients with
more advanced stages of the disease (shown by
marked abnormalities in a MEP study) were not
substantially improved by transplantation. Act-
ually, neuropathologic conformation for HM is
very difficult and it is rarely performed. It is
supposed that MEP studies for HM are able to

make up for the weak points of clinical diag-
nosis.

HM is resistant to many therapeutic strategies
that are effective in reducing ammonia pro-
duction and absorption. Two recent studies
reported the neurologic outcomes of patients
with HM who had undergone liver transplan-
tation*” A liver transplant could fully reverse
the effects of HM in patients with early-stage
disease, whereas it had little effect in patients
with more advanced stages of the disease®
These findings indicate that early stages of the
disease only involve demyelination of the spinal
cord, but that axonal loss occurs at the advanced
stage. Thus, early and accurate diagnosis of HM
and a subsequent transplantation seem to be
important. MEP studies may be useful for the
early diagnosis of HM and for monitoring
progression of the disease.

In summary, here we describe two patients
who developed HM in the presence of spon-
taneous splenorenal shunt without any episode of
hepatic encephalopathy. One patient received
medical treatment aimed at reducing ammonia
production and absorption, which did not prevent
progression of spastic paraparesis. The other
patient underwent liver transplantation and
exhibited slow but appreciable improvement in
neurologic symptoms. Our findings indicate that
liver transplantation should be considered as the
first therapeutic option of HM and be conducted
as early as possible before the spinal cord
damage becomes irreversible.
