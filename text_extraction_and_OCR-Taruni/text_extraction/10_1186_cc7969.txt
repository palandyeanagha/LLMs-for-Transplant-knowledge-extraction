Abstract
Introduction Patients with sepsis often demonstrate severely
impaired immune responses. The hallmark of this state of
immunoparalysis is monocytic deactivation characterized by
decreased human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and
reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently,
diminished numbers of dendritic cells (DCs) were reported in
patients with sepsis. However, little is known about DC
phenotype and function in human sepsis. We therefore
compared phenotypic and functional changes in monocyte and
DC subsets in patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis.
Methods In a prospective observational analysis, 16
consecutive patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (age
59.2 ± 9.7 years, 13 male, Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment score 6.1 ± 2.7) and immunoparalysis (monocytic
HLA-DR expression < 5,000 antibodies/cell) and 16 healthy
volunteers were included. Peripheral blood DC counts, HLA-DR
expression and ex vivo cytokine production were evaluated in
comparison with monocyte subsets over time.
Results At baseline, a profound reduction in the numbers of
myeloid DCs (MDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs), and
CD14dimCD16positive monocytes was observed in sepsis
whereas CD14brightCD16negative and CD14brightCD16positive
monocyte numbers were increased. HLA-DR expression was
reduced on all monocyte and DC subsets. Production of
proinflammatory cytokines and intracellular cytokine staining in
response to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid was
impaired in monocyte subsets and MDCs, whereas IL-10
secretion was increased. IFNα response by stimulated PDCs
was significantly decreased compared with controls. At day 28,
HLA-DR expression and cytokine production of DC and
monocyte subsets remained lower in septic patients compared
with controls.
Conclusions In sepsis, long-lasting functional deactivation is
common to all circulating monocyte and DC subsets. In addition
to decreased peripheral blood DC counts, functional impairment
of antigen-presenting cells may contribute to an impaired
antimicrobial defense in sepsis.
Introduction
Sepsis is a major medical challenge with a high annual inci￾dence rate. Despite improvements in critical care, however,
the outcome from sepsis has improved little and mortality rates
remain high [1-3]. Earlier, the prevailing theory was that mor￾tality from sepsis largely is a consequence of an overwhelming
host inflammatory response [4-6]. Failure of clinical trials tar￾geting inflammatory mediators to improve the outcome from
sepsis and recent insights prompted reconsideration of this
concept [4-8]. Today, it is recognized that the host's immune
response during sepsis changes over time, resulting in both
inflammation and profound immunosuppression in the later
APC: antigen-presenting cell; DC: dendritic cell; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FITC: Fluoresceinisothiocyanat; HLA: human leukocyte 
antigen; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; LPS: lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin; LTA: lipoteichoic acid; MDC: myeloid dendritic cell; ODN: oligonucle￾otides; PDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cell; PE: phycoerythrin; TLR: Toll-like receptor; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.

course of the disease. Many patients surviving the early phase
of sepsis therefore often show signs of severe immunosup￾pression [4-6,9-16].
A number of immune dysfunctions have been reported in sep￾sis, including apoptosis of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes,
altered cellular cytokine production, increased levels of the
anti-inflammatory IL-10, impaired phagocytosis, monocyte
deactivation with diminished major histocompatibility class II
molecule expression, and altered response to microbial prod￾ucts [17-22]. The term immunoparalysis was proposed to
describe the host's general inability to mount effective immune
responses. We and other workers have demonstrated an
association between low levels of the major histocompatibility
complex class II molecule human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR
on monocytes and the impairment of cellular immunity in sep￾sis, including decreased production of proinflammatory
cytokines, impaired antigen presentation, and reduced ex vivo
lymphocyte response to recall antigens [9,20,23,24]. Impor￾tantly, prolonged downregulation of monocytic HLA-DR was
associated with an adverse outcome from sepsis [20,24].
Consequently, a number of clinical pilot trials aiming to reverse
immunoparalysis via immunomodulatory strategies were
recently performed [9,25,26].
In contrast to the extensively studied major population of clas￾sical CD14bright monocytes, little is known about phenotypic
and functional changes of CD16positive (Fcγ receptor III) mono￾cyte subsets in sepsis. In healthy individuals about 10 to 15%
of circulating monocytes are CD16positive cells, which express
higher levels of HLA-DR and proinflammatory cytokines than
CD16negative monocytes after stimulation with microbial prod￾ucts. This CD16positive subset has therefore been referred to as
proinflammatory monocytes [27-29]. Although expansion of
CD16positive monocytes was shown in sepsis [30], it is cur￾rently unclear whether this subset undergoes functional deac￾tivation similar to classical CD14brightCD16negative monocytes
in sepsis.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) and play a key role in linking innate and adaptive
host immune responses to microorganisms. Distinct subsets
of circulating DCs can be identified in peripheral blood, includ￾ing myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (PDCs) [31]. Although arising from common precursor
cells in the bone marrow, MDCs and PDCs are phenotypically
and functionally different [32]. For example, PDCs but not
MDCs express the receptor for dsDNA (Toll-like receptor
(TLR) 9), while TLR4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysac￾charide (LPS), is restricted to MDCs [31]. Activation of MDCs
by LPS via TLR4 results in the secretion of TNFα, IL-1β and IL￾6, while PDCs secrete enormous amounts of IFNα after stim￾ulation with the TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotides (ODN),
and may play an important role in antiviral immunity [31,33].
Upon encountering microbial products, DCs undergo pheno￾typic and functional maturation and migrate to secondary lym￾phatic organs, where they induce adaptive T-cell responses.
Compromised DC function was associated with increased
disease severity and adverse outcome in animal models of
sepsis [34-36]. Increased apoptosis of DCs has been demon￾strated in spleens from patients with sepsis, and an early
decrease in circulating DCs was shown to correlate with
increased disease severity and mortality [37,38]. Data on func￾tional changes in DCs in sepsis patients, however, remain
scarce.
The aim of the present study was to determine and compare
phenotypic differences and functional changes in different
monocyte and DC subsets over time in patients with sepsis
and immunoparalysis.
Materials and methods
Study population and protocol
Sixteen consecutive patients (13 men, age 59 ± 9.7 years)
with severe sepsis or septic shock and immunoparalysis hos￾pitalized in the surgical intensive care unit of a tertiary care
academic centre were included between January 2004 and
January 2005. Sixteen healthy volunteers (13 men, age 46 ±
11.4 years) served as controls.
During the study interval, a total of 22 intensive care unit
patients were screened for the presence of immunoparalysis,
and all patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria entered the
analysis. The following inclusion criteria applied: age > 18
years, presence of severe sepsis or septic shock [39], and
presence of immunoparalysis (monocytic HLA-DR expression
< 5,000 antibodies/cell). Hepatitis B or hepatitis C patients,
HIV patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs
(for example, steroids) were excluded.
Disease severity was assessed daily using the Simplified
Acute Physiology Score 2 and the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment score. Clinical data, microbiological data and 28-
day mortality were recorded. Blood samples were collected on
the day after enrolment (baseline) and at study day 28.
Informed consent was achieved from the patient or respective
representatives. The study was performed in adherence with
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local eth￾ics committee on human research.
Media and reagents
For ex vivo cell culture, RPMI 1640 medium (PAA Laborato￾ries, Pasching, Germany) was used. The medium was tested
for low TNF-inducing capacity (TNFα release < 10 pg/ml) in
heparinized whole blood samples from healthy controls. Endo￾toxin (LPS) from Escherichia coli (L-4516) was purchased
from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
from Staphylococcus aureus (DSM 20233) was a kind gift
from Dr S. Morath (Konstanz, Germany). Commercially availa-

ble ODN CpG 2336 (ODN class A), CpG 2243 (control class
A), CpG 2395 (ODN class C) and CpG 2137 (control class
C) were used (Coley Pharmaceutical, Kanata, Canada).
Determination of cytokine secretion by monocytes and 
dendritic cells
Heparinized blood was diluted 1:5 in RPMI without supple￾ments and was incubated (6 hours, 37°C, 5% CO2) with 100
ng/ml LPS or 10 μg/ml LTA for cytokine measurement in the
supernatants. For stimulation with ODN class A and ODN
class C, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
from heparinized venous blood samples by density gradient
centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Ger￾many). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured at a
concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in supplemented RPMI 1640
medium and were stimulated with 1 μg/ml ODN class A, ODN
class C, ODN control class A or ODN control class C. After
incubation (24 hours, 37°C, 5% CO2) supernatants were sep￾arated from cells for cytokine measurement. Quantification of
HLA-DR on circulating monocytes was performed using a
standardized flow cytometric assay, as described elsewhere
[40].
For enumeration of DC subsets, 150 μl whole blood was
stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies against lineage mark￾ers (lin1) (mixture of anti-CD3/CD14/CD16/CD19/CD20/
CD56), anti-CD123-PE, anti-HLA-DR-PerCP and anti-CD33-
APC (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). PDCs were
gated as lin1 -
CD123+HLA-DR+ events, and MDCs as lin1 -
CD33+HLA-DR+ events. After treatment with FACS Lysing
Solution (BD Biosciences), at least 150 to 300 events per DC
population were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest￾Pro (BD Biosciences) software. HLA-DR expression on DCs
was measured as the mean fluorescence intensity. Absolute
APC population frequencies were calculated as white blood
cell counts multiplied by the ratio of the APC population over
all leukocytes.
Intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry
For flow cytometric measurement of intracellular cytokines,
heparinized blood samples were diluted 1:1 in RPMI without
supplements and were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS and 10
μg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma) for 6 hours (37°C, 5% CO2). After
stimulation, cells were washed and stained with anti-CD14-
FITC, anti-HLA-DR-PerCP and anti-CD33-APC (BD Bio￾sciences). Leukocytes were fixed and permeabilized with
FACS Lysing Solution and FACS Perm2 (BD Biosciences),
and were stained with anti-TNFα-PE, anti-IL-1β-PE, anti-IL-6-
PE, anti-IL-10-PE (BD Biosciences) or murine IgG1-PE (Immu￾notech, Marseille, France) as control.
Detection of cytokines, procalcitonin and C-reactive 
protein
Cytokine production was assayed in culture supernatants and
plasma by ELISA. Commercial kits were used to determine
IFNα (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ, USA),
TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in supernatants (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). IL-10 plasma levels were measured
by ultrasensitive ELISA (lower detection limit, 0.78 pg/ml; Bio￾source, Nivelles, Belgium). Immunoluminometric assays
(Lumi® PCT; Brahms, Hennigsdorf, Germany) were used to
detect procalcitonin plasma levels. High-sensitivity C-reactive
protein was measured immunoturbidometrically in a certified
laboratory.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analyses, SPSS for Windows software (version
12.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used. Data are pre￾sented as the mean ± standard deviation. The Mann – Whit￾ney U test was used for comparison between patients and
controls. Wilcoxon's test was used for comparison between
baseline and day 28 in the patient group. P < 0.05 was con￾sidered significant.
Results
Study population and follow-up
Sixteen consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic
shock and immunoparalysis were included (Table 1). The
mean stay on the intensive care unit until inclusion was 3.2 ±
2.9 days and sepsis was diagnosed on the day of intensive
care unit admission in all individuals. At inclusion, 10 patients
had septic shock and received vasopressor (norepinephrine)
support.
Disease severity scores improved slightly from baseline to day
28 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score 2, 33.5 ± 8.5 to 28.8
± 11.9, not significant; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
score, 6.1 ± 2.7 to 4.8 ± 2.2, P < 0.05). The mean procalci￾tonin and C-reactive protein levels decreased from baseline to
day 28 (procalcitonin, 2,924 ± 3,860 to 445 ± 470 pg/ml, P
< 0.01; C-reactive protein, 20.2 ± 9.4 to 10.6 ± 5.8 mg/dl, P
< 0.01). IL-10 levels also decreased over time (20.2 ± 53.4 to
4.0 ± 2.0 pg/ml, P < 0.05).
The major etiology of sepsis was pneumonia (n = 6), peritonitis
(n = 4), and pancreatitis (n = 3) (Table 1). In 15/16 patients,
positive cultures (n = 8 Gram-negative, n = 4 mixed spectrum)
of relevant microorganisms were recorded (Table 1). Gram￾negative infection was associated with the presence of septic
shock (P < 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate was 19%.
Distribution of monocyte and dendritic cell subsets in 
sepsis
Three different monocyte subsets can be distinguished in
peripheral blood according to their CD14 and CD16 surface
expression [41] (Figure 1a and Table 2). At baseline, the fre￾quency of CD14brightCD16positive monocytes was increased in
sepsis patients compared with healthy controls (17.9 ± 6.2%
vs. 6.0 ± 1.6%, P < 0.001; Figure 1a). In contrast, the propor￾tion of CD14dimCD16positive monocytes decreased in sepsis

patients (3.0 ± 5% vs. 6.4 ± 2.5% (controls), P < 0.001). The
opposing changes in the two CD16positive monocyte subsets
were also observed for absolute cell numbers, along with the
typical increase in CD14brightCD16negative monocytes (Figure
1a). At day 28, cell counts of all monocyte subsets remained
significantly different from controls (Figure 1a).
Human peripheral blood contains at least two distinct popula￾tions of DCs [42]. In the present study, PDCs (lin1-
CD123+HLA-DR+) and MDCs (lin1 -
CD33+HLA-DR+) were
analyzed (Figure 1b). Compared with controls, both PDC and
MDC counts in sepsis patients were lower at baseline (PDCs,
8.6 ± 4.0 vs. 1.9 ± 1.3 cells/μl, P < 0.001; MDCs, 13.5 ± 5.5
vs. 4.2 ± 4.5 cells/μl, P < 0.001; Figure 1b). Both DC popula￾tions recovered slightly until day 28 (PDCs, 3.8 ± 3.6 cells/μl;
MDCs, 6.7 ± 5.1 cells/μl), but remained below corresponding
control levels (both P < 0.001; Figure 1b).
HLA-DR expression on monocyte and dendritic cell 
subsets
Reduced monocytic HLA-DR expression is a hallmark of immu￾noparalysis. While previous studies have focused on HLA-DR
expression on classical monocytes (CD14brightCD16negative),
little is known about the regulation of HLA-DR on CD16positive
monocyte and DC subsets in sepsis. In line with the inclusion
criteria, HLA-DR on CD14brightCD16negative monocytes was
strongly diminished in patients compared with controls (P <
0.001; Figure 2a). At day 28, HLA-DR expression on
CD14brightCD16negative monocytes increased (P < 0.01) but
remained below control levels (P < 0.001; Figure 2a). Only
three patients reached persistent monocytic HLA-DR levels
above the lower normal range (> 15,000 antibodies/cell), indi￾cating recovery from immunoparalysis. No significant associa￾tion between severity of immunoparalysis (that is, monocytic
HLA-DR levels) and clinical outcome of patients was
observed.

Similar to classical monocytes, HLA-DR expression on the
CD14brightCD16positive monocyte subset was approximately
eightfold reduced in comparison with controls (P < 0.001) at
baseline, and remained significantly different from control lev￾els at day 28 (Figure 2a). In contrast, HLA-DR downregulation
on CD14dimCD16positive monocytes was less pronounced (1.5-
fold compared with controls at baseline, P < 0.01) and HLA￾DR levels did not statistically differ from controls at day 28
(Figure 2a).
We found a significant downregulation of HLA-DR on both DC
subsets in septic patients that was more pronounced on
MDCs (Figure 2b): HLA-DR on MDCs averaged 174 ± 54
mean fluorescence intensity in sepsis at baseline and 497 ±
128 mean fluorescence intensity in controls (P < 0.001). This
almost threefold reduction was not seen on PDCs, which
showed an expression of 177 ± 66 mean fluorescence inten￾sity at baseline compared with 239 ± 77 mean fluorescence
intensity in controls (P < 0.05). At day 28, HLA-DR expression
on MDCs slightly recovered (257 ± 105 mean fluorescence

with controls (P < 0.01), while HLA-DR levels on PDCs (216
± 97 mean fluorescence intensity) almost reached control lev￾els (Figure 2b).
Cytokine secretion by monocytes and dendritic cells
To determine the functional status of APC subsets, we
assessed the cellular cytokine secretion profile. First, the pro￾duction of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was analyzed in whole
blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures after
stimulation with TLR ligands. Secretion of proinflammatory
cytokines in cultures from septic patients was significantly
diminished at both time points compared with cultures from
controls (Figure 3a). In contrast, IL-10 secretion after LPS
stimulation was significantly enhanced at baseline and day 28.
Stimulation with LTA exhibited less biological potency than
LPS, but revealed similar findings with significantly reduced
levels of all three proinflammatory cytokines and a tendency
towards increased IL-10 secretion in whole blood cultures
from septic patients.
The functionality of PDCs was assessed via TLR9 stimulation
using CpG ODN. Three different classes of ODN (class A,
class B, class C) have been identified and linked to preferen￾Figure 3

drawn from healthy controls or patients at the indicated time points (baseline, day 28) and stimulated for 6 hours with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 
lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Cytokine levels were measured in the supernatants by ELISA and were normalized to monocyte counts. (b) Simultaneously, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with either class A (2336) or class C (2395) oligonucleotides (ODN). After 24 hours, the con￾centration of IFNα in the supernatants was determined using ELISA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

tial cytokine induction in either PDCs (class A) or B cells (class
B), or both (class C). Because activation of TLR9 signaling by
ODN in PDCs, but not in B cells, has been shown to specifi￾cally induce secretion of IFNα, we used class A and class C
ODN for stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
determine IFNα secretion by PDCs. At baseline, IFNα secre￾tion was depressed after stimulation with ODN class A (P <
0.001) as well as ODN class C (P < 0.001) when compared
with controls. A significant recovery was observed at day 28
versus baseline for both ODN class A stimulation (P < 0.05)
and ODN class C stimulation (P < 0.05), but IFNα levels
remained lower than in controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for
ODN class A and ODN class C, respectively). Reduced IFNα
secretion is unlikely to be only due to the observed decrease
in PDC counts, since IFNα release at baseline is decreased
about ninefold and 11-fold for ODN class A and ODN class C,
respectively, compared with controls whereas PDC counts
were diminished by only fourfold. Similarly, PDC counts at day
28 in septic patients were twofold lower compared with con￾trols, but IFNα secretion was reduced by fourfold for both
ODN class A and ODN class C (Figures 2b and 3b).
Intracellular levels of cytokines in monocyte subsets and 
myeloid dendritic cells
To characterize the diminished cytokine production at the cel￾lular level, APC subsets were analyzed by intracellular cytokine
staining. Since identification of CD16positive monocyte subsets
is impaired by the loss of CD16 expression shortly after LPS
stimulation (data not shown), CD33 was used as an alternative
marker. Classical CD14brightCD16negative and
CD14brightCD16positive monocytes express high levels of
CD33, whereas CD14dimCD16positive monocytes are CD33dim.
This remains unchanged during LPS stimulation (data not
shown) and enabled us to evaluate classical
CD14brightCD33bright monocytes versus
CD14dimCD33dim(CD16bright) monocytes. MDCs were identi￾fied by the lack of CD14 and higher CD33 expression com￾pared with CD14bright monocytes.
At baseline, the percentage of TNFα-producing (P < 0.01)
and IL-6-producing (P < 0.01) CD14bright monocytes was
diminished after LPS stimulation in septic patients compared
with controls, whereas no significant differences were
observed for IL-1β and IL-10 producers (Figure 4). An
increased proportion of TNFα-positive cells (P < 0.05), IL-1β￾positive cells (P < 0.05) and IL-6-positive cells (P = 0.01) was
observed at day 28 compared with baseline (Figure 4). In the
CD33dim(CD16positive) monocyte population, a similar reduc￾tion in the percentage of cytokine-producing cells was
observed at baseline, although this reached statistical signifi￾cance only for TNFα (P < 0.05 vs. controls; Figure 4). In
MDCs, the frequency of TNFα-producing cells (P < 0.005), IL￾6-producing cells (P < 0.05) and IL-10-producing cells (P <
0.05) was significantly impaired at baseline compared with
controls (Figure 4).
At day 28, the percentage of cytokine-positive cells after LPS
stimulation was not significantly different (compared with con￾trols) for all subsets despite strongly reduced cytokine levels
in supernatants of LPS-stimulated or LTA-stimulated whole
blood cultures (Figures 3 and 4).
Discussion
Altered monocyte function, including diminished HLA-DR
expression and impaired proinflammatory cytokine response,
was previously reported in patients with sepsis, severe trauma
and major surgery. Such monocytic deactivation indicates a
state of globally impaired immune functions and correlates
with poor clinical outcome in critically ill patients. Neverthe￾less, whether this phenomenon is restricted to classical mono￾cytes or is common to all monocyte and DC subsets is
currently unclear. We demonstrate that sepsis-induced
immune dysfunction affects all circulating myeloid APC sub￾sets and that these functional alterations are long-lasting.
Today, it is well established that circulating monocytes repre￾sent a heterogeneous cell population. Among the antigenic
markers, CD14 and CD16 (also known as Fcγ RIII) are com￾monly used to distinguish monocyte subsets (Table 2). In addi￾tion to the majority of monocytes that express high levels of
CD14 but not CD16, a minor population of CD16positive mono￾cytes was identified. These cells have characteristic expres￾sion patterns distinct from classical monocytes, including high
HLA-DR expression. CD16positive monocytes may be subdi￾vided into CD14bright and CD14dim cells. The latter subset has
morphological and functional similarities to DCs, including a
strong capacity to activate naïve T cells in vitro [42,43]. Expan￾sion of CD14brightCD16positive monocytes has been observed
in patients with sepsis and other inflammatory conditions
[30,42,43]. Little is known, however, of the functional changes
including both cytokine production and HLA-DR expression in
CD16negative and CD16positive monocyte subsets during the
course of sepsis.
Consistent with previous reports, we observed a significant
increase in the circulating numbers of CD14brightCD16negative
and CD14brightCD16positive monocytes in sepsis. Unlike these
monocyte subsets, CD14dimCD16positive monocytes were sig￾nificantly decreased in our patient population. This is in con￾trast with previous data demonstrating an increase in both
CD14bright and CD14dimCD16positive monocytes in neonates
and children with sepsis [44], and may reflect age-related dif￾ferences in the differentiation and/or survival of CD16positive
monocytes.
Similar to classical monocytes, we observed that CD16positive
subsets show signs of profound functional deactivation in sep￾sis. Although HLA-DR levels differ between respective sub￾sets, HLA-DR was diminished in all monocyte subsets in
sepsis at baseline. Notably, CD14dimCD16positive monocytes
showed only a slight reduction of HLA-DR expression at base-

line while HLA-DR levels of both CD14bright subsets remained
significantly diminished in sepsis even at day 28. Moreover,
consistent with previous data [9,45], we observed significantly
reduced proinflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, IL-1β, IL￾6) and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-10) after
stimulation of whole blood with LPS and LTA in septic
patients. Although we did not determine cytokine secretion in
isolated monocyte subsets, we demonstrate reduced intracel￾lular levels of TNFα and IL-6 in both CD16negative and
CD16positive monocytes after LPS stimulation. Together with
markedly diminished cytokine levels in the supernatants of
LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures from septic patients
(despite a significant increase in absolute numbers), this may
indicate that both CD16negative and CD16positive monocytes
undergo deactivation in sepsis.
Interestingly, in contrast to the markedly reduced cytokine lev￾els in supernatants of stimulated whole blood cultures, differ￾ences in the percentage of cytokine-positive monocytes after
LPS stimulation were less pronounced between patients and
controls. Notably, the percentage of IL-1β-positive monocytes
did not differ between septic patients and controls even at
baseline, suggesting that proteolytic processing and/or secre￾tion of IL-1β rather than synthesis and intracellular accumula￾tion of inactive pro-IL-1β in monocytes are defective in sepsis.
In fact, interference with the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β
and secretion of mature IL-1β was proposed as a potential
mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 [46]. In
addition to defects in cytokine transcription and translation,
reduced monocytic cytokine production in sepsis may result
from impaired post-translational processes involved in
cytokine secretion.
DCs are key players in innate and adaptive immune responses.
During infection, tissue-resident DCs recognize characteristic
microbial patterns resulting in the uptake of pathogens, matu￾ration and migration of DCs to lymphoid tissue, and activation
of T-cell responses. In mice, previous studies demonstrated
extensive depletion of DCs in secondary lymphatic organs
after endotoxin challenge and polymicrobial sepsis
[34,47,48]. Markedly reduced numbers of DCs were also
observed in the spleens of patients with sepsis [38]. In a
mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation
and puncture, increased numbers of apoptotic CD11c+ DCs
in mesenteric lymph nodes have been demonstrated as early
as 24 hours after cecal ligation and puncture [34]. Moreover,
reduced numbers of circulating DCs in patients have been
observed within 24 hours after onset of septic shock [37].
These data indicate that DC apoptosis occurs early in sepsis,
and prompted us to assess functional DC alterations in the
course of sepsis. We observed a profound reduction in
peripheral MDC and PDC counts in septic patients at baseline
that remained significantly decreased on day 28 compared
with controls. Whether this is due to ongoing DC apoptosis,
due to increased migration of circulating precursor DCs into
peripheral sites of inflammation or results from prolonged
diminished re-population of DCs from the bone marrow, how￾ever, remains speculative [49].
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate
a marked and sustained functional impairment of circulating
DC subsets in patients with sepsis. Similar to the phenotypic
changes in monocytes resembling functional deactivation,
peripheral blood DCs from septic patients showed a downreg￾ulation of surface HLA-DR expression and a reduced secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with microbial
products. Relative to healthy controls, stimulation of MDCs
from septic patients with LPS resulted in significantly reduced
production of TNFα and IL-6, as indicated by intracellular
cytokine staining. In addition, IFNα secretion by PDCs after
stimulation with TLR9-activating CpG ODN was significantly
decreased in sepsis, and this reduction exceeded (more than
twofold) the decrease in PDC counts both at baseline and
after 28 days.
Collectively, our data suggest a functional deactivation of both
MDCs and PDCs during sepsis. Recent experimental findings
provided experimental evidence for a crucial role of defective
DC responses for the increased susceptibility to secondary
infections during sepsis by demonstrating that increased mor￾tality to an otherwise innocuous pulmonary Aspergillus fumig￾atus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge in post-septic
mice can be reversed by adoptive therapy using bone-marrow￾derived DCs [49,50]. Moreover, significantly lower peripheral
blood MDC and PDC counts have already been observed in
nonsurvivors early after onset of septic shock [37]. Whether
the loss of DC correlated to the persistence of primary infec￾tions or to the occurrence of opportunistic infections, how￾ever, was not investigated. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the specific consequences of the sustained loss and
dysfunction of circulating DC subsets for impaired antimicro￾bial defenses in sepsis patients.
The mechanisms leading to altered cytokine responses and
diminished major histocompatibility complex class II expres￾sion in DCs during sepsis are incompletely understood.
Recent experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have demon￾strated that DCs, similar to monocytes, become tolerant after
exposure to microbial products – resulting in reduced produc￾tion of proinflammatory cytokines upon repeated stimulation
[48,51]. In addition to impaired cytokine responses, endo￾toxin-desensitized DCs were shown to be poor inducers of T￾helper type 1 cell responses [51]. Tolerance induction in DCs
was also shown for other TLR ligands, including CpG ODN
[52]. The data presented here are consistent with a functional
impairment of TLR4 and TLR9 agonist-induced cellular
responses in MDCs and PDCs in patients with sepsis. In line
with previous findings, we found increased IL-10 levels in sep￾tic patients at baseline and at day 28 [17,21]. IL-10 might con￾tribute to the observed downregulation of HLA-DR on

monocytes and DCs via enhanced re-endocytosis and
sequestration of HLA-DR in monocytes [17]. In line with recent
findings demonstrating that IL-10 inhibits IFNα production in
PDCs in vitro, we observed in our study an inverse correlation
of IL-10 levels with CpG-induced IFNα production by PDCs
(P < 0.001, Spearman rho = -0.83). Nonetheless, other fac￾tors including downregulation of TLR-receptor expression and
altered TLR-induced signal transduction may play a role in
monocyte and DC deactivation in sepsis [48].
Conclusions
We demonstrate a profound and sustained functional impair￾ment of all circulating monocyte and DC subsets in patients
with sepsis and immunoparalysis. Further studies are required
to elucidate the individual role of different APC populations in
the compromised antimicrobial defenses in sepsis, and to
determine whether reconstitution of APC function by immu￾nomodulatory interventions may improve sepsis outcome.
