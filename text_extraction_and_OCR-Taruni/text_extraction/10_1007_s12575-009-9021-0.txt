Abstract
Pancreatic islets of Langerhans secrete hormones that are vital to the regulation of blood glucose and are,
therefore, a key focus of diabetes research. Purifying viable and functional islets from the pancreas for
study is an intricate process. This review highlights the key elements involved with mouse and rat islet
isolation, including choices of collagenase, the collagenase digestion process, purification of islets using
a density gradient, and islet culture conditions. In addition, this paper reviews commonly used techniques
for assessing islet viability and function, including visual assessment, fluorescent markers of cell death, glu￾cose-stimulated insulin secretion, and intracellular calcium measurements. A detailed protocol is also in￾cluded that describes a common method for rodent islet isolation that our laboratory uses to obtain viable
and functional mouse islets for in vitro study of islet function, beta-cell physiology, and in vivo rodent islet
transplantation. The purpose of this review is to serve as a resource and foundation for successfully pro￾curing and purifying high-quality islets for research purposes.

1. Introduction
Pancreatic islets are thought to play a key role in the pathophys￾iology of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes through the failure of islet
beta cells to secrete sufficient quantities of insulin to regulate
blood glucose (1). In recent years, increasing interest surrounding
islet replacement therapies in humans has provided the drive for
advances in the methods used to isolate islets from humans as well
as a host of animal research models (2, 3). Although there are

many published islet isolation protocols specific to mouse and rat,
few provide the necessary details for researchers to successfully
perform the complex procedures.
The primary goal of isolating pancreatic islets, whether for in
vivo transplantation or in vitro studies, is to obtain viable purified
islets that respond in a manner consistent with their function in
vivo. The key elements of a successful islet isolation procedure
are: (1) enzymatically digesting the tissues connecting the islets
to the exocrine tissue, (2) separating islets from non-islet tissue,
and (3) culturing isolated islets in an environment that maintains
cell viability. We review these key elements and provide methods
for evaluating islet quality. In addition, we present a common
method for the isolation of rodent islets used regularly in our islet
isolation facility to consistently procure viable and functional islets
for in vitro study of islet function, beta-cell physiology, and in vivo
islet transplantation. Our protocol is, by no means, the only suc￾cessful method for isolating pancreatic islets; however, the addi￾tional details provided in this protocol are intended to provide
the rationale for each step in the process in order to assist
researchers in their efforts to obtain healthy islets for study.
2. Procedures
of islet isolation
2.1. Basic
methodologies The two most prevalent approaches for isolating islets from rodent
pancreatic tissue differ, primarily, in the way digestive enzymes are
introduced to the pancreatic tissue surrounding the islets. In the first
approach, the pancreas is excised from a euthanized animal and cut
into 1–2 mm pieces, thus increasing the surface area and providing
conditions for the digestive enzyme collagenase to break down the
tissue surrounding the islets (4, 5). The pancreatic pieces are enzy￾matically digested in a collagenase solution and concurrently me￾chanically digested by being stirred or shaken. In the second
approach, described by Gotoh et al., collagenase is injected into
the common bile duct (CBD) of a euthanized animal. The pancreas
is then excised and digested at 37°C without being cut into pieces or
mechanically digested (6).
Although these two approaches form the foundation for many
islet isolation techniques, there are considerable variations in the
details among published methods, as well as alternative methods
for isolating islets (7–11). The advantages of the CBD method de￾scribed by Gotoh et al. are twofold: (1) perfusing the pancreas
through the CBD allows collagenase to access the islets using ana￾tomical structures, and (2) stationary digestion reduces mechanical
4 Carter et al.

damage to the islet. A comparison of these two methods showed that
either method can be used to procure viable and functional rat islets;
however, the Gotoh et al. method produced an islet yield approxi￾mately 50% higher and was more cost effective (12).
Our laboratory uses a modification of the CBD protocol when
isolating rodent islets (see Appendix A for a annotated murine pro￾tocol and Appendix B for an abbreviated version). Although can￾nulation of the rodent bile duct requires technical skill, we are
partial to this approach. Collagenase may interact more closely with
the connective tissue surrounding the islets when delivered
through intact anatomical structures, which results in a higher islet
yield as suggested by others (12). Szot et al. provide a detailed
video account of a rodent islet isolation using a method of bile duct
cannulation (13). We describe an alternative method of injecting
lobes of the pancreas in situ for cases when the bile duct has been
compromised or cannot be used (see Appendix A, 12B). When
evaluating any islet isolation protocol, one must consider that the
outcome is influenced by differences in the type and concentration
of collagenase used, the method of collagenase administration, the
temperature and duration of pancreas digestion, the method for
purifying islets from pancreatic acinar tissue, and the culture condi￾tions following isolation.
2.2. Considerations
for choosing
collagenase
Collagenase enzymes are routinely used in digesting connective
tissue that binds islets to other pancreatic tissue. Variability exists
between manufacturers and between each lot of collagenase prod￾uct from the same manufacturer. Enzyme activity, purity, and for￾mulation, therefore, strongly influence the outcome of the islet
isolation. The composition of collagenase and other enzymes in
each lot must be ideal to the task of isolating islets specifically.
Wolters et al. have described, in detail, the differences in isolation
with purified collagenase types 1 and 2 separately, and the combi￾nation that yields the most effective rat islet isolation (14, 15). De
Haan et al. formulated criteria for evaluating each lot of commer￾cially available collagenase to ensure proper digestion of rat islets
(16). Formulations with increased collagenase activity, a specific
range of both neutral proteases and clostripain, and with low lev￾els of trypsin activity may produce the most viable islets (14, 16).
We have found that optimal collagenase formulations for rat islet
isolations also provide acceptable criteria for rating collagenase
used in our mouse islet isolation procedures.
Digestive enzyme formulations for islet isolation range from
crude collagenases to highly purified combinations used exten￾sively in human islet transplants. Brandhorst et al. suggest that
the differences from lot to lot may be due to the lack of proper
accounting of tryptic-like activity, even in the most pure mixtures
of collagenases, such as Liberase HI (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) and collagenase NB1 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) used
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 5

in isolation of human islets for transplantation (17). The tryptic￾like activity in enzyme blends may work in concert with the other
enzymes to increase the activity of the digestion, although there is
some debate about the damage tryptic-like activity has on the
islets (18). Enzyme blends with high purity and precise notation
of the components are used in human islet isolation to ensure
consistent activity and reproducibility (17, 19). Enzymes with
higher purity, and consequently a higher price, are also used in
human pancreatic islet isolation to reduce incidence of contamina￾tion by endotoxins.
2.3. Endotoxins
are another
consideration
Endotoxins correlate with increased proinflammatory cytokines
in models of transplantation (19). Endotoxins have been iden￾tified in both the digestion and gradient separation steps. Colla￾genase formulations as well as different types of gradient
compounds have been identified as containing endotoxins in
varying amounts (19). Endotoxins are of particular concern in
human-to-human islet transplantation procedures. Infiltration of
transplanted islets by inflammatory cytokines has been attributed
to endotoxin contamination (19).
2.4. The process
of collagenase
digestion
Almost as important as the specific formulation of collagenase is en￾suring that a protocol is optimized to the collagenase type and activ￾ity and to the animal species and strain in a given protocol. Factors
that influence the process include digestion time, digestion temper￾ature, collagenase concentration, and the route of administration of
collagenase, which vary widely among protocols. Perfusing the pan￾creas through the common bile duct allows collagenase to access the
islets using biological structures, which may change the duration of
digestion when compared to other methods. Differences between
collagenase batches and other factors that influence digestion facili￾tate the need for testing each protocol for optimal islet viability and
islet function, which remains paramount to success and reproducibil￾ity of islet isolation.
Our laboratory follows published guidelines for collagenase
enzyme formulations (16), which provide consistency for
expected outcomes during digestion. We use Collagenase P
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) enzyme at 1.4 mg/mL in a mod￾ified Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) injected into the pancreas via the CBD. The pancreas is
then excised whole and placed in modified HBSS for stationary
digestion at 37°C for 8–11 min as described in detail in
Appendices A and B.
2.5. Gradient separation
of islets and pancreatic
acinar tissue
There is some debate regarding the use of a density gradient to
purify islets from acinar tissue. Purifying islets from acinar tissue,
regardless of the method, is important due to the nature of the
pancreatic tissue. The cells of the exocrine pancreas secrete various
6 Carter et al.

digestive enzymes necessitating the separation of islets from pan￾creatic acinar tissue (20). Sodium diatrizoate, Histopaque (Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), is a hypertonic solution also used
in isolating other cell types. Our laboratory has used Ficoll 400
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Histopaque at different
densities. In isolations with Ficoll 400 layered in a discontinuous
gradient of 1.109, 1.096, 1.070, and 0.570 g/mL islets were iso￾lated from the interfaces of both the 1.070/1.096 and 1.096/
1.109 g/mL layers. However, we found that the preparations
were often contaminated with acinar tissue. Our purity results
generally improved using aseptically filled and premixed Histopa￾que, which is also available in sterile preparations. Combining
Histopaque 1.119 g/mL with the 1.077 g/mL preparation to
produce a 1.100 g/mL gradient appears to enhance islet purity.
It should be noted that these studies comparing Histopaque
and Ficoll were not rigorous, and both gradients are widely used
and accepted. We provide our anecdotal evidence for consider￾ation in choosing a purification method.
The final purity of the product depends on the animal strain
and the characteristics of density gradients. In our experience,
lean rodents tend to yield a higher purity of the final preparation
than those with more fat. There is also a strain-dependent differ￾ence in the outcome of the gradient purification, which is consis￾tent with findings describing strain-dependent differences in islet
isolation (21).
A second purification of islets from acinar tissue is often need￾ed to further increase islet purity prior to culture. Our protocol
includes using a microscope to identify islets, then handpicking
those islets from one suspension culture dish into a second dish
containing a buffered solution or culture medium, such as HBSS
or RPMI, respectively. Islets can then be transferred to a dish con￾taining culture media for overnight incubation. Once islets have
been transferred to media, minimizing time outside the sterile in￾cubator will limit exposure to contamination and pH changes
while handpicking islets for experiments.
2.6. Islet yield The total number of islets found in a rodent pancreas varies consid￾erably among strains. Bock et al. compared seven different mouse
strains and found the number of islets per pancreas ranged from
971±88 (129S6 mice) to 2,509±133 (B6 mice) (22). Using a
mouse model of diabetes, Bock et al. identified a similar number
of islets per pancreas (~3,200) for both ob/ob and ob/+ control
mice; the islets from the diabetes-prone ob/ob mice were 3.6 times
larger, however, than ob/+ controls (23). In young male Wistar rats,
Inuwa et al. demonstrated that the total islet number increased with
age, ranging from ~6,000 to ~20,000 islets per pancreas (24). Other
studies have estimated the number of rat islets as low as approximate￾ly 3,000–5,000 per pancreas (25, 26). Therefore, the expected islet
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 7

yield from an isolation procedure depends a great deal on the age and
strain of the rodent.
The expertise of the technician, as well as the method of iso￾lation chosen, will also influence the total islet yield. Conse￾quently, a definitive expected yield is difficult to quantify. With
an experienced technician yields from various mouse strains
should range from 200–400 with average yields of 300 islets
per mouse (6, 9). Rat yields range from approximately 600–
800 islets per animal (21). Based on estimates of total islet
numbers, this suggests that the islet yield ranges from 10% to
30% for the typical rodent pancreas. For comparison, the human
pancreas is thought to contain over one million islets, and the
typical isolation yields approximately 250,000–450,000 islets
as estimated by islet equivalents (27).
3. Islet culture
conditions
After performing islet isolation, proper culture conditions are
imperative to ensuring that the islets are able to recover from
the insult of collagenase digestion. Examination of media with
different glucose concentrations indicated that islets cultured
with 11 mM glucose have lower apoptosis rates and increased vi￾ability than those in media with both higher and lower glucose
concentrations for rodents (28). Media with glucose concentra￾tions substantially below 11 mM can reduce islet insulin content
and downregulate key genes related to glucose metabolism,
whereas extended exposure to high glucose causes toxicity (28,
29). Studies of optimal culture conditions demonstrated that
RPMI 1640 with serum maintains or augments glucose-stimu￾lated insulin secretion in murine islets (30). Insulin secretion
remained lower in islets cultured in five other types of culture
media brought to comparable glucose concentrations (30).
Thus, properties apart from its higher glucose concentration
(11 mmol/L) make RPMI 1640 suited for studies of insulin se￾cretion in murine islets (30). In another study CMRL1066,
rather than RPMI 1640, was used to culture rat islets in order
to preserve the insulin secretory capacity (16).
We use RPMI 1640 culture medium both for culturing islets
and while purifying islets from acinar tissue after the density gra￾dient separation. RPMI1640 is supplemented with 10% (v/v) fe￾tal bovine serum to promote viability and with 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin to reduce the possibility
of contamination. Islets are plated in 100×20 mm suspension cul￾8 Carter et al.

ture dishes (Corning Inc., # 430591), rather than culture-treated
dishes, to decrease islet attachment. Islets are cultured in 10 mL
of RPMI 1640 media in these dishes.
To maintain islets for long-term culture, the optimal islet density
is four islets per square centimeter in order to prevent competition
for nutrients (16). Overnight incubation of 16–20 h provides islets
time to recover from the harsh process of collagenase digestion.
Recovery in a sterile incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 infusion and
humidified air is necessary for islet function prior to performing via￾bility or functional assessment assays (30). Rodent islets can maintain
glucose sensitivity for at least 1 week in culture with frequent
medium changes (30) and perhaps even longer based on data from
human islets (30, 31); however, changes in rodent islet function can
occur between as little as between 1 and 4 days in culture (32).
4. Assessment
of islet health
and function
4.1. Morphology Visual inspection of the islets can provide some rudimentary infor￾mation regarding health. When viewed with a scanning objective
lens under a light microscope, islets appear spherical and golden￾brown, approximately 50–250 μm in diameter. These features,
particularly the darker color of islets in comparison to the relative￾ly transparent exocrine tissue, allow for rapid identification of
islets as shown in Fig. 1a. Healthy isolated islets following over￾night recovery also have few, if any, individual cells protruding
from the relatively smooth rounded surface (Fig. 1b). Cells pro￾truding from the surface can be a sign of decreased or decreasing
health (compare Fig. 2a and b described below). Larger islets are
also prone to developing hypoxic cells in their center, visibly dis￾tinguishable as darker cells compared to the surrounding tissue
(Fig. 1c). Reducing the amount of media in the dish to allow in￾creased oxygenation may reduce this effect (33).
4.2. Islet viability Supplementing visual inspection with additional techniques can pro￾vide quantification of islet viability and functionality. We define via￾bility as living versus dead or dying cells as assessed using cell
exclusion or DNA-binding dyes. A common approach in the human
islet transplant field is to measure the ratio of healthy living cells to
dead cells within each islet with fluorescence microscopy. Fluoresce￾in diacetate (FDA) incorporates into healthy cells by facilitated diffu￾sion and fluoresces blue; propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) is a membrane impermeant red fluorescent dye
that is excluded from viable cells and enters only dead or dying cells

10 Carter et al.

(34). Using these fluorescent dyes in combination, the health of
islets can be assessed by the FDA/PI ratio. Unmanipulated isolated
islets from healthy control animals generally have 90–95% viability,
meaning blue FDA staining in 90–95% of the component cells of
an islet and red PI staining is detectable in only 5–10% of the cells
in any given islet. Additional techniques commonly used to measure
islet viability include AnnexinV, SYTO-13/ethidium bromide, cal￾cein AM/ethidium homodimer, fluorescein diacetate, and ethidium
bromide which are more expensive but are also more sensitive to islet
cell damage than FDA/PI (34–36).
We use a variation of the above approach by quantifying the
mean intensity of PI fluorescence within an islet. Imaging soft￾ware records the fluorescence intensity within a region of interest
(ROI) designated by an encircled islet. Healthy islets typically dis￾play smooth round borders (Fig. 2a, top panel) and show minimal
PI staining (Fig. 2a, bottom panel). Unhealthy cells, such as islets

(top panel) and significantly greater PI staining (bottom panel).
The mean pixel fluorescence intensity of the ROIs is used to
quantify cell death as listed atop the lower panels of Fig. 2a, b.
4.3. Glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion
A fundamental property of pancreatic islets is their capacity to reg￾ulate the release of insulin and other hormones in direct response
to changes in extracellular glucose concentration. In large part,
this ability defines islet function since insulin is produced and re￾leased in the body only from islet beta cells. Insulin is crucial to
regulating blood glucose, and reduced insulin secretion is a key
feature of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (1). Glucagon, so￾matostatin, and other peptides are also produced by islet cells,
but these are secreted in smaller amounts and more difficult to de￾tect. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is thus a well-ac￾cepted measure of islet function.
To measure GSIS, islets are cultured in a ‘low’ glucose concen￾tration, typically near 3 mM, to measure the amount of insulin
secreted into the media under ‘basal’ or ‘unstimulated’ conditions.
Stimulated insulin release is measured by exposing islets to a higher
glucose concentration such as 11.1 mM (half-maximal) or 928 mM
(maximal). In response to the glucose stimulation, the time course
of the islet response is biphasic, consisting of a rapid spike in insulin
release (first phase) followed by a decline to a prolonged second
phase plateau of insulin that remains throughout the duration of
the stimulus. GSIS can be measured either by static conditions or
by perfusing islets to measure the kinetics of insulin release in
response to glucose. Each technique has its advantages and disad￾vantages, which are reviewed elsewhere (37). The glucose stimula￾tion index (SI) is the ratio of stimulated-to-basal insulin secretion.
Healthy islets have an SI of 2–20 depending on several factors
including strain, age, and body weight.
4.4. Glucose-stimulated
calcium
In nearly any cell type, the tight regulation of intracellular calcium
([Ca2+]i) is crucial to normal functioning of many cellular process￾es including metabolism, signal transduction, and exocytosis (38).
As in the GSIS assay, analyzing islet [Ca2+]i in response to changes
in extracellular glucose concentration provides supportive infor￾mation about islet viability and function because calcium is an in￾tegral component of the insulin secretion pathway (39–41).
Therefore, measuring the glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]i response
(GSCa) in islets offers a reasonable reflection of insulin secretion
(42) and more importantly, a potentially sensitive indicator of
overall islet health and function in vitro (43). A number of fluo￾rescent probes are commonly used to measure intracellular calci￾um including fura-2 acetoxy-methyl-ester (fura-2AM), fluo-3,
fluo-4, and fura red.
12 Carter et al.

As a demonstration of GSCa, we compared islets cultured
overnight in RPMI 1640 containing either 5.5 mM glucose or
11 mM glucose. Following overnight culture treatment, islets
were loaded with fura-2AM (43), and then [Ca2+]i was recorded
in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate containing 3 mM glucose followed
by stimulation with 11 mM glucose. The normal GSCa consists
of three phases: phase 0 (the initial dip below baseline due calcium
uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum), phase 1 (the rapid rise to
peak calcium that is concomitant with the release of pre-docked
insulin granules), and phase 2 (the elevated plateau; 44). As
shown in Fig. 3a, the GSCa was more robust for islets cultured
in 11 mM glucose RPMI 1640 compared to islets cultured in
5.5 mM glucose RPMI 1640. Specifically, the mean amplitude
(calculated as the change in calcium from basal levels) of phase
1 and phase 2 was significantly higher among islets cultured in
11 mM glucose (Fig. 3b). These differences are consistent with
previous reports of optimal viability and function when islets are
cultured in 11 mM glucose culture media (28, 30) and demon￾strate the sensitivity of using GSCa as a valuable technique for
assessing islet function.
There are several advantages of measuring GSCa over GSIS.
Substantial time and costs are involved in GSIS since insulin must
be measured by immunoassay following the GSIS experiment,
whereas GSCa provides results in real-time without additional ex￾pense. Furthermore, GSCa utilizes frequent sampling, which
allows for precise temporal analysis of the amplitude, latency,
and trajectory of changes in response to glucose stimulation. Also,
GSCa can be used to assess individual islets, so fewer than ten
islets would be sufficient to characterize the function for the entire
batch. In contrast, islets must be grouped together for GSIS to
produce detectable quantities of insulin, especially for islet perfu￾sion studies (we use 50 islets for each replicate in perfusion stud￾ies). One limitation, however, is that GSCa cannot be easily
normalized to a standard value in the same way that insulin is nor￾malized to a standard set of insulin concentrations. Coupled with
potential differences in dye loading and changes in light source in￾tensity/efficiency over long periods of time, these issues make
batch-to-batch comparisons of different islet preparations using
GSCa difficult. These issues can be somewhat mitigated by deter￾mining the stimulation index, which is commonly used to assess
GSIS from donor to donor in human islets for transplantation
purposes (45).
4.5. Islet dissociation
and cell identification
Islets are composed of several distinct cell types consisting of the
glucogon-secreting alpha cells, insulin-secreting beta cells, so￾matostatin-producing delta cells, and others (46–48). The per￾centage of these cells, as well as their anatomical locations in
islets, varies between species. In rodents, the majority of cells
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 13

are beta cells (65–85%) and alpha cells (10–25%), with the
remaining 5–10% of cells consisting of delta cells and other cell
types (46–48). Isolating these cells requires either mechanically
disrupting the bonds between cells or using a digestive enzyme
to separate the cells (49). Once islets have been separated into
their component cells, use of counterflow elution as described
by Pipeleers (50), or light scatter flow cytometry as described
by Rabinovitch et al. (51) may be used to identify and purify
the cells. We provide a detailed protocol describing the dissocia￾tion and culturing of murine islet cells in Appendix C.

5. Conclusions
The ability to consistently procure viable and functional islets is
crucial to effectively studying the physiology and pathophysiology
of islets and their constituent cells. As stated previously, islet iso￾lation is an intricate process. In this review, we have addressed the
key factors to consider in the isolation and assessment processes to
obtain both viable and functional islets. In the accompanying pro￾tocol, we provide a method developed by integrating the reports
of many others in the research field with careful experimentation
to optimize the islet isolation process for our laboratory. While
following this protocol provides a start for islet isolation, any pro￾cedure must be optimized to the capabilities of the laboratory and
the specific goals of the study.

Collagenase is an area where there are differences in protocols. We
have chosen to maintain a constant concentration of 1.4 mg/mL
and to vary the digestion time to suit different lot numbers. Stud￾ies use different collagenase types, but we ensure specific criteria
are met by each lot prior to use. The digestion time is based on

We prepare and store a stock solution at 4°C. Only the amount of
Histopaque required is brought to room temperature prior to its

Protocol
1. Prepare 1 mL of G-solution for each mouse in a 15 mL conical.
2. Place each 15 mL conical from Step 1 in ice.
In order to inhibit the collagenase digestion prior to incu￾bation, place a 15 mL conical containing 1 mL of HBSS
for each mouse on ice. The ice will maintain the collage￾nase-filled pancreata at a temperature which inhibits di￾gestion. The ice also serves to maintain uniform
conditions while isolating islets from multiple pancreata.
3. Euthanize animal with CO2 or inject mouse IP with
0.01 mL/g body weight of solution (B). The mouse is ready
for exsanguination after no response to pinching its foot.
Note: the investigator MUST refer to institution Animal Care
and Use Committee guidelines and policies regarding proper
procedures when handling and using animals in research.
Some researchers prefer to use ketamine/xylazine when
collecting blood samples.
4. (Optional) Exsanguinate the animal by heart perfusion using
a 1 mL syringe with 25 Ga needle.
5. Wet abdominal fur with 70% alcohol to reduce the chance of
hair contamination in the IP cavity during subsequent steps.
6. Open abdomen with standard pattern scissors in a V-shape
starting from the lower abdomen and extending to the lateral
portions of the diaphragm in order to expose all organs in the
peritoneal cavity (Fig. 4).
7. Turn the animal so that the nose is closest to the surgeon and
the tail points away from the surgeon.
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 17

This position allows for cannulation into the common
bile duct from the rostral end closest to the liver at the
junction of the cystic and hepatic ducts, leaving space to
inject again closer to the duodenum if an error occurs.
8. Secure the liver with 2″×2″ gauze.
Lay the liver flat and place an unfolded 2″×2″ piece of
gauze under the liver closest to the surgeon. Gently flip
the liver over onto the gauze exposing the junction of
the gall bladder and common bile duct. Fold the remain￾ing gauze over the liver to secure it during cannulation of
the common bile duct.
9. Using a Johns Hopkins Bulldog clamp (Roboz# RS-7441),
clamp off the common bile duct near the junction with the
small intestine. Alternatively, tightly tied suture string can
be used to tie off the CBD at the junction with the small in￾testine.
The pancreas contains a system of ducts that allows pan￾creatic enzymes to flow into the gut. The pancreatic duct
merges with the inferior end of the CBD where the pan￾creatic enzymes enter the duodenum (see Fig. 4). This
pancreatic duct provides the most readily available access
to the endocrine pancreas. Clamp the CBD as close to the
junction with the small intestine as possible so as not to
occlude the pancreatic duct (see Fig. 5). Clamping the du￾odenum on either side of the junction with the CBD is
also an option. Using a clamp allows access to the pancre￾atic duct while closing off access to the duodenum. Also

18 Carter et al.

attached to the CBD are several hepatic ducts. After be￾coming proficient with the perfusion technique, the ma￾jor hepatic duct that leads to the caudal right lobe of
the liver could also be clamped to ensure that minimal
collagenase is delivered to the liver.
10. Fill a 5 mL syringe with solution (C).
11. Cannulate the CBD with a 27–30 gauge 0.5 in. needle se￾cured to a 5 mL syringe or a 27–30 gauge butterfly needle.
Cannulate the CBD at the junction of the cystic duct from
the gall bladder and left hepatic duct from the liver (forms
a Y-shape, see Fig. 5).
At the most superior portion of the CBD the junction of
the cystic duct and hepatic duct forms a Y-shaped refer￾ence point in most mice. This location allows the surgeon
the opportunity to cannulate the CBD with a 27 gauge
butterfly needle or a 27 gauge 0.5 in. needle in 5 mL sy￾ringe. Tips for a successful cannulation of the duct: (1)
use a new needle for each attempt because the needle
may dull very easily; (2) place the needle at the Y-shaped
junction and slide the needle into the duct moving in
1 mm increments (small-scale movement is the key to
success); (3) if the duct is difficult to visualize, squeeze
gently on the gall bladder which may cause the CBD to
turn yellow as bile flows through.
12. Inject 4–5 mL of solution (C) into CBD.
A. An injection of 4–5 mL collagenase solution into the
CBD should be sufficient to completely inflate the pan￾creas such that there is fluid in all regions of the pancreas
from head to tail. Ensuring that the collagenase inflates

the pancreas in its entirety allows for the maximum yield
of islets. The distribution of islets in the pancreas is not
uniform; studies show a higher concentration of islets in
the pancreatic tail, which makes the full inflation of the
pancreas even more important. This step requires skill of
the surgeon to obtain consistent results, and success is
directly related to islet yield.
B. Failed attempts to infuse the pancreas with collagenase
through the hepatic duct eventually destroy the duct.
An alternative method involves directly injecting colloge￾nase into the numerous lobes of the pancreas. In this
method, it is important to inject small amounts (about
one to two drops) of collagenase into as many of the lobes
of the pancreas as possible. Begin by locating and lifting
the spleen ~1 in. above the body cavity with forceps.
The pancreas is attached to the spleen and should be visi￾ble. Beginning at the top, inject two to three drops of col￾lagenase to inflate individual lobes of the pancreas using a
5 mL syringe with 30 gauge needle. As the lobe inflates,
move the needle downward into the next lobe and the
next, allowing gravity to help get collagenase into the pan￾creas, until the needle hilt reaches the tissue (~1 cm). Re￾move the needle, and reenter the tissue at another section
of tissue to inflate other sections. Adjust forceps as neces￾sary to hold new sections of pancreas above the body cav￾ity in order to inject downward. Continue to follow the
pancreas with the needle and inject the pancreatic lobes
along the stomach and intestine. When as many lobes have
been injected as possible, remove the pancreas and contin￾ue the protocol.
13. Remove pancreas from mouse and place into a 15 mL conical
from Step 1.
A. During the removal of the pancreas, it is important to
avoid intestinal rupture in order to reduce the risk of
contamination of the cell culture by intestinal bacteria.
Removal begins at the point of attachment of the
CBD to the duodenum. Using forceps or scissors snip
the CBD and gently detach the pancreas from the intes￾tines. Then, cut the CBD from the attachment to the
liver. Continue to remove the pancreas from the greater
curvature of the stomach and finally the spleen. Place
the removed pancreas into the 15 mL conical that holds
1 mL of cold HBSS and replace the tube in the ice.
B. After injecting the pancreas, place the pancreas that has
been directly injected with collagenase into 1 mL of col￾lagenase solution on ice, rather than HBSS, as in the
preferred CBD-cannulation method above.
20 Carter et al.

14. Repeat the above steps for all mice, then proceed to the next
step.
Follow the above procedure for the remaining animals
placing one pancreas per tube on ice.
15. Incubate for *8 min at 37°C in 15 mL conical tube. *Incuba￾tion time varies among different lots of collagenase (usually
8–11 min).
After collecting the pancreata into their respective tubes
on ice, place the same tubes directly into a water bath at
37°C to incubate for 8–11 min. The incubation time
varies between lots of collagenase; therefore, it is im￾portant to test each lot prior to use in experimental
conditions.
16. Shake the 15 mL tube containing digested pancreas hard by
hand for approximately 5 s to complete the separation of tis￾sue (the result should be the consistency of pea soup and free
of large pieces of pancreatic tissue if the pancreas was com￾pletely inflated).
This step results in the mechanical digestion of the pan￾creas and can be performed for all tubes simultaneously
if the tubes are placed into a rack for incubation and cov￾ered while shaking. If fat tissue was incubated with the
pancreas, it will remain undigested after shaking.
17. Quickly place the 15 mL conical in ice and fill to 15 mL with
G-solution to dilute collagenase concentration and slow the
digestive process.
18. Centrifuge 2 min at 1,200 rpm (290×g).
19. Discard the supernatant by decanting into a waste container.
20. Wash with of 10 mL G-Solution, 2 min at 1,200 rpm
(290×g).
All wash steps, unless otherwise stated, involve resuspend￾ing the tissue pellet with a sterile 10-mL pipette using
room temperature HBSS followed by room temperature
centrifugation at 290×g for 2 min.
21. Discard the supernatant by decanting into a waste container.
22. Add 10 mL of G-solution and resuspend with a 10 mL pipette.
23. Filter each sample through a size 40 (420 μm) sieve (Bellco
Glass, Inc, Cat# 1985-00040) into separate 50 mL conicals.
It is important to put each pancreas into its own conical
so that the gradient can sustain the tissue load and prop￾erly separate the islets from the exocrine tissue. Overload￾ing the gradient will lead to reduced islet yield and purity.
24. Bring volume to 20 mL with G-solution.
25. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 2 min to pellet resuspended tissue.
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 21

26. Decant supernatant, and place the opening of the 50 mL conical
onto a paper towel to remove as much liquid as possible.
Removing all of the liquid ensures that the gradient density
is not diluted when the pellet is resuspended in the gradient.
27. Resuspend pellet in 10 mL Histopaque 1100 Solution with a
10 mL pipette.
Resuspending the tissue completely in the gradient ensures
that islet density is not affected by attached exocrine tissue.
Tissue filtered through the sieve should resuspend to a
state that appears almost homogenous in the gradient.
28. Centrifuge for 20 min at 1,200 rpm. Note: islets are in the
supernatant.
After centrifugation, islets should be visible in the super￾natant of the gradient as floating white specks. If there are
fewer islets present than expected, resuspend the pellet
produced during the previous step in order to inspect
for islets. Also note that if more than one pancreas is
added to the gradient, many islets will be found in the
pellet. This should not be the case if the gradient contains
only one mouse pancreas.
29. Label a new 50 mL conical, and add 25 mL of G-solution.
30. Decant the supernatant into the new 50 mL conical with G￾solution from the previous step.
Note: collect all washes below to be able to look through them
later.
31. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (453×g) for 4 min and decant the
supernatant. Note: islets are in the pellet.
Take care to pour the solution into the waste container in
one motion in order to avoid having the solution wash
back onto the pellet causing the islets to become dis￾lodged and subsequently decanted.
32. Add 10 mL of G-solution to the pellet, and pipette up and
down several times with a 10 mL pipette.
The final washes of the pellet are very important to ensur￾ing that the islets are clear of the Histopaque solution and
that the islets are well separated from one another prior to
plating in culture dishes.
33. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 3 min.
34. Decant the supernatant and replace with 10 mL of culture
medium.

Protocol
1. Autoclave microscope cover slips and the Roboz micro dis￾section forceps as well as all glassware to be used for the dis￾sociation. Allow sufficient time to dry completely.
A. To autoclave the cover slips, use aluminum foil to make
long, rectangular packet that can hold six or seven cover
slips that overlap slightly (no more than 1/4 of the
width/diameter of the slip). Place the packet into an au￾toclave pouch. To minimize the chance of breaking the
cover slips, place no more than three packets into the
autoclave pouch.
B. Wrap the Roboz micro dissection forceps in foil and
place in a small autoclaveable pouch as well.
2. The day before the dispersion, isolate islets and allow recov￾ery overnight in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. If the islets
A Practical Guide to Rodent Islet Isolation and Assessment 27

are received from elsewhere, allow recovery overnight in
fresh medium as above.
3. Place one slip into a well of a six-well plate.
4. Coat the cover slips with a 0.4% gelatin coating. Allow to sit
in the hood for 15 min, then aspirate the excess gelatin off
the cover slides.
5. Place the coated cover slips in incubator overnight to dry. If
rushed, 2 hours in an incubator should be sufficient to allow
the gel coating to dry.
6. Aliquot RPMI 1640 growth medium into a 50 mL tube and
warm. A minimum of 4 mL is needed for every 100 islets.
7. Aliquot 500 μL trypsin per 100 islets into a second 50 mL
centrifuge tube and allow to warm to 37°C.
8. To keep islets and the cells from sticking to the tubes, coat
glass specimen tubes and glass pasture pipets with Sigmacote
(Sigma #SL-2), following Sigmacote protocol.
9. Place 500 μL of trypsin in Sigmacoted specimen tube. If the
trypsin is cold, cover with parafilm and place in the incubator
to warm.
10. Use 100 islets per specimen tube, the larger the islet, the bet￾ter. Place islets with a minimum of medium, into the warm
trypsin. Perform this step one tube at a time. Do not allow
the islets to sit in the trypsin for prolonged periods of time.
11. Triturate the islets using a Sigmacoted pasture pipet. Triturate
rapidly against the sides of the tube while trying to avoid mas￾sive amounts of bubbling, or suctioning into the pipettor.
12. Observe the islet/trypsin mix to see if you can still see the
islets. If so, triturate again to try and break the islets apart.
13. Add 1.5 mL RPMI 1640 to each specimen tube to neutralize
the action of the trypsin.
14. If doing more than one tube of islets, place parafilm over the
top of the tube and place in the incubator. Proceed to the
next tube repeating the steps above until all tubes are done.
15. Place the tubes containing the cell suspension in a centrifuge
and spin at 800 rpm for 3 min.
16. Carefully remove the supernatant by aspirating. Locate the
cell pellet at the bottom of the tube, and aspirate without dis￾turbing the pellet. (The easiest way to aspirate is to carefully
tilt the tube and insert the aspiration line. Tilt the tube in a
smooth motion to avoid backwash that could disturb the cell
pellet. Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible.)
17. Resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of warm RPMI 1640. Use a
1,000 μL pipette to aliquot the RPMI into the tube and a
Sigmacoted pasture pipet to resuspend.
28 Carter et al.

18. Using either a siliconized or low sample retention 1,000 μL
pipette tip to aliquot the cell suspension onto the gel-coated
cover slips.
19. Place 250 μL of the suspension onto each gel coated coverslip.
Note that the cells will concentrate into the center of the drop.
20. Place the plate into the incubator for 45 min to 1 h to allow
the cells to settle. The drops of suspension will spread out to
cover the slide while in the incubator.
21. After 45 min to 1 h, add 2 mL of fresh, pre-warmed RPMI
1640 culture medium to each well. Carefully add the medi￾um by allowing it to gently flow down the side of the well, in
order to minimize disturbances to the cells.
22. Place in the incubator and allow cells to recover overnight.
23. The following day warm 2 mL of RPMI 1640 culture medi￾um per well.
24. Carefully aspirate one well at a time and add 2 mL of fresh
medium, again along the side of the well to minimize agitat￾ing the cells. Work quickly to minimize exposure to air.
25. Check the cells under a microscope, remembering that the
greatest concentration will be where the center of the drop
or drops were placed.
