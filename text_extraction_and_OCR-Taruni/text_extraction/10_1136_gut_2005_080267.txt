Background: The majority of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection suffer from disabling fatigue,
cognitive dysfunction, and quality of life reduction. Meanwhile, there is increasing evidence that HCV
infection can affect brain function. Recent studies have shown that fatigue and psychomotor slowing may
resolve in patients with hepatitis C after treatment with ondansetron. This observation indicates alteration
of serotonergic neurotransmission in HCV infected patients with chronic fatigue.
Methods: Data from 20 HCV infected patients who were referred to our clinic because of disabling fatigue
and cognitive decline of unknown cause were analysed retrospectively. Patients had undergone a
diagnostic programme, including clinical and psychometric examination, electroencephalogram (EEG),
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and I-123-beta-CIT (2b￾carbomethoxy-3-b-(4-[123I]iodophenyl)tropane) single photon emission computerised tomography
(SPECT) studies of serotonin and dopamine transporter binding capacity.
Results: All patients had pathological results on the fatigue impact scale. Two thirds of patients showed
pathological attention test results. EEG, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis
were normal. Pathological dopamine transporter binding was present in 12/20 (60%) patients and
pathological serotonin transporter binding in 8/19 (50%) patients. Patients with normal SPECT results did
not significantly differ from controls with regard to psychometric test results. Interestingly, patients with
both decreased serotonin and dopamine transporter binding showed significantly impaired performance
in most of the tests applied. Comorbidity that could have impaired cerebral function was excluded in all
patients.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate alteration of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in HCV
infected patients with chronic fatigue and cognitive impairment.
Chronic hepatitis C has been assumed to result in liver
cirrhosis in approximately 30% of patients.1 Recent data
however demonstrated a more benign course of the
disease.2–6 In the majority of patients, extrahepatic manifes￾tations of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be observed.
The most frequent are disabling chronic fatigue, cognitive
decline, mood alterations, and musculoskeletal pain.7–9
Importantly, these manifestations are unrelated to the grade
of liver disease. Up to 60% of women infected by anti-D
prophylaxis, for example, were found to suffer from impair￾ment in well being even though they usually do not present
significant liver disease decades after their infection.256 Goh
and colleagues10 investigated whether the degree of fatigue in
patients with chronic hepatitis C depends on the degree of
liver disease or the presence of concomitant autoimmune
disorder. They used the fatigue impact scale (FIS)11 to assess
the severity of fatigue. They found significantly higher FIS
scores in patients than in healthy controls. However, there
was no difference between patients with and without virus
replication, no correlation of the FIS score with the degree of
liver dysfunction, and no difference between patients with
and without concomitant autoimmune disorders. Other
studies showed a significant reduction in quality of life in
hepatitis C patients.12–15 Again, no correlation between grade
of liver disease, virus replication rate, and quality of life
scores was found.
The cause of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood
disorder in HCV infected patients with only mild liver disease
is not known. There is however growing evidence for
involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in the
disorder.16–20
A clinical observation21 reported by Jones in 1999
implicated possible alteration of serotonergic neurotransmis￾sion. Jones observed that ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytrypta￾mine-3 receptor antagonist, improved well being in HCV
infected patients by a marked reduction in fatigue and an
increase in the patient’s psychomotor speed. His observation
was recently confirmed by Piche and colleagues22 who found
in a double blind placebo controlled study in 36 patients with
chronic hepatitis C a significantly positive effect of ondanset￾ron on chronic fatigue.
Inspired by these data on alteration of serotonergic
neurotransmission in HCV infected patients with neuropsy￾chiatric symptoms, we included I-123-beta-2b-carbo￾methoxy-3-b-(4-[123I]iodophenyl)tropane (CIT)-single
photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) studies

progressive neuropsychiatric disturbances who were referred
to our clinic for diagnostic purposes.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Twenty patients (13 female; mean age 48.8 (5.3) years) with
a history of HCV infection but only mild if any liver disease
who had been referred to our clinic for clarification of
disabling fatigue and cognitive decline of unknown cause
underwent a diagnostic workup, including neurological
examination, detailed neuropsychological examination, bio￾chemical assessment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis
(n = 18), electroencephalogram (EEG), cerebral magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and SPECT of mesencephalic/
hypothalamic serotonin (SERT) and striatal dopamine (DAT)
transporter binding capacity using I-123-beta-CIT. In addi￾tion, patients completed questionnaires for assessment of
health related quality of life and mood disturbances.
Biochemical assessment included thyroid function (n = 20),
hepatitis B (n = 20), and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) serology (n = 14). Examinations were performed
within approximately 72 hours while patients stayed at the
hospital.
Data presented in this paper were retrospectively compiled
and analysed. Data analysis was approved by the local ethics
committee. In addition, patients gave informed consent.
Ten patients had been infected via application of anti-D￾immunoglobulins, two patients via transfusion, three
patients had a history of drug abuse more than 20 years
ago, and in five patients the route of infection remained
unclear. The genotype of the virus was 1b in 16 patients, 1a in
two patients, and 3a in two patients. In all but two of the
patients the infection and/or diagnosis of the infection had
occurred more than 15 years ago. In one patient the time
interval between infection/diagnosis and inclusion in this
study was nine years while in another it remained unclear.
Sixteen patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
positive at the time of admission and four were PCR negative.
Two of the PCR negative patients had cleared the virus after
interferon therapy more than one year previously (one former
drug abuser and one patient from the anti-D group). The two
others—which had both been infected via anti-D prophy￾laxis—had cleared the virus spontaneously. All but one of the
patients did not take any CNS affecting medications. One
patient was receiving citalopram 10 mg daily. Her serotonin
transporter binding was normal. Therefore, she was not
excluded from data analysis.
The psychometric test battery comprised the PSE syndrome
test,24 the cancelling ‘‘d’’ test,25 and the tests ‘‘alertness’’,
‘‘divided attention’’, ‘‘incompatibility’’, ‘‘modality compari￾son’’, ‘‘attention shift’’, and ‘‘Go/NoGo’’ from the TAP battery
(Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitspru¨fung (battery of atten￾tion tests)).26 Furthermore, the hospital anxiety and depres￾sion scale (HADS),27 Beck’s depression inventory (BDI),28
FIS,11 and the SF-36 questionnaire29 were performed.
Individual neuropsychological results were evaluated by
comparison with norm data provided by the test manuals. In
addition, patient test results were compared with those of 14
healthy controls (10 females; mean age 51.5 (15.2) years).
All patients underwent a standard 12 channel EEG. EEG
assessment was performed visually.
MRI of the brain was performed using a 1.5 T GE Signa
Horizon. Conventional transverse and coronal T1 weighted
images (TR 500 ms/TE 15 ms/slice thickness 5 mm/slice gap
1,5 mm) and sagittal T2 weighted fast IR images (TR
4000 ms/TE 40 ms/TI 130 ms/slice thickness 5 mm/slice gap
1.5 mm) were achieved to exclude cerebral lesions.
SPECT images (Multispect 3; Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) were obtained four hours after intravenous
injection of 200 MBq I-123-Beta-CIT to assess SERT in the
hypothalamus/midbrain region and 24 hours post injection
to measure striatal DAT. Imaging was performed according to
the guidelines of the European Association of Nuclear
Medicine.30 To detect count densities in regions of specific
tracer binding (caudate and putamen on either side,
hypothalamus/midbrain), small regions of interest of stan￾dardised shape and size were positioned over the respective
structures on transaxial tomograms. Non-specific binding
was assessed using a more extended reference region which
was drawn over the occipital or cerebellar cortex, respectively.
As a measure of transporter binding capacity, ratios of count
densities in specific binding areas compared with those in
non-specific binding regions were calculated. As we did not
observe regionally pronounced impairment of striatal bind￾ing, a mean value for ratios obtained for the four subregions
was used for further analysis of striatal binding. SPECT
results in patients were compared with norm data achieved
from the study of 20 healthy controls (11 females; mean age
50.2 (18.9) years) with respect to DAT binding and 16
healthy controls (eight females; mean age 47.3 (17.2) years)
with respect to SERT binding previously. Further details of
the reference groups are given in Berding and colleagues.31
Statistical analysis
To evaluate whether differences between SPECT results in
patients and controls were significant, the t test for
independent samples was used. A correlation analysis was
performed to detect correlations between transporter binding
and the various neuropsychological parameters. All p values
were adjusted for multiple testing by applying the
Bonferroni-Holm procedure.32 In addition, the patient group
was subdivided into four groups based on SPECT data: (1)
normal DAT and SERT binding; (2) reduced SERT but normal
DAT binding, (3) reduced DAT but normal SERT binding; (4)
both reduced DAT and SERT binding. All subgroups were
compared with controls using Dunnett’s test for multiple
comparisons. In addition, subgroups with reduced DAT but
normal SERT binding3 and with reduced DAT and SERT
binding,4 respectively, were compared with the patients
subgroup with normal SPECT results using Dunnett’s test
for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
There were no significant differences in age and sex between
patients in the respective comparison groups. Liver function
was normal in all 20 patients. Liver biopsy was performed in
seven patients. There was no indication of liver cirrhosis in
any of the 20 patients based on both biopsy and APRI score23
(APRI score ,1, n = 18; APRI score 1.1, n = 1, APRI score 1.9,
n = 1, Ishak fibrosis score in this patient, 4). None of the
patients had hepatitis B or HIV coinfection. Thyroid function
was normal in all patients. Routine biochemical examina￾tions did not reveal any metabolic dysfunction or immuno￾logical disease. CSF cell count and total protein, and EEG and
MRI were normal in all patients.
FIS, mood, and quality of life scores
All patients had a pathological FIS score (mean 94.6 (25)
(range 51–141); normal range ,35). The HADS anxiety and
depression scores were abnormal (.7 points) in 13 and 10
patients, respectively. BDI was normal in four patients
(,10 points) while six scored as mild (11–17 points), six as
moderate (18–23 points), and three as severe (.23 points)
depression. SF-36 indices differed significantly from those
given in the manual for the corresponding age group of
healthy controls (fig 1). Thereby patients scored worst with
regard to the subscores ‘‘role physical’’, ‘‘vitality’’, and ‘‘role
emotional’’.
The four PCR negative patients scored in the worst half of
the mood and quality of life scores, showing an FIS score of
107–134, BDI 13–20 (n = 3), HADS-A 4-17, and HADS-D
5–17. Their SF-36 sum score was 81–304 (maximum
achievable 800 points).
Psychometric test results
The sum score of the PSE syndrome test result was abnormal
in two (one PCR negative) and the d2 test in five (two PCR
negative) patients. Fourteen of 16 patients who underwent
the TAP battery had pathological results in the ‘‘divided
attention’’ test while approximately two thirds of patients
achieved pathological results in the remaining subtests of the
battery (table 1). Three of the four PCR negative patients
underwent the TAP battery. In most of the tests at least two
of them achieved pathological results while all three had
pathological test results in the alertness test (simple and
warned reaction time) and the modality comparison test.
SPECT results
DAT and SERT binding were significantly reduced in patients
compared with the reference group of healthy subjects (DAT:
controls 9.39 (1.26), patients 6.91 (2.69), p,0.0006; SERT:
controls 3.02 (0.29), patients 2.58 (0.08), p,0.0001) (figs 2,
3). Pathological DAT binding (that is, more than 2 SDs
reduced) was present in 12/20 (60%) patients; pathological
SERT binding was present in 8/19 (50%) patients. Six
patients had pathological SERT and DAT binding and six
had entirely normal results. SERT and DAT binding were
pathological in three of the four PCR negative patients, while
both were normal in the fourth.
There was no correlation between the SPECT data (DAT
and SERT) and FIS, or mood and quality of life scores. In
addition, there was no correlation between the SPECT results
and the psychometric data after adjustment of p values for
multiple testing.
After subdivision of the patient group according to their
SPECT results however, it became obvious that patients with
altered DAT or DAT and SERT binding differed significantly
from controls in most of the psychometric tests (tables 2 and
3; fig 4) while there was no difference in psychometric results
between patients with normal SPECT and controls. There was
also no significant difference between the subgroups with
regard to FIS, HADS, BDI, and SF36 results.
Patients with decreased DAT and SERT binding differed
significantly from controls with regard to the following test
results: number of evaluated items minus errors in the
cancelling d test, percentage of errors in the cancelling d test,
number of errors in the ‘‘modality comparison’’ and ‘‘atten￾tion shift’’ test, number of missings in the ‘‘divided
attention’’ and ‘‘modality comparison’’ test, reaction time in
the subtests ‘‘modality comparison’’ and ‘‘attention shift’’,
and simple and warned reaction time in the ‘‘alertness test’’
of the TAP. Patients with significantly decreased DAT but
normal SERT binding also did worse than controls but did
not reach the level of significance in as many tests as those
with altered DAT and SERT binding (table 3). After
Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons,32 they
achieved significantly worse results than controls (nominal
a = 0.0042 for the smallest p value) only with regard to the
number of errors in the attention shift test and reaction time

in the divided attention test. Patients with altered DAT and
SERT binding differed significantly from controls after
Bonferroni-Holm correction with regard to the test d2 results
(items—errors, percentage of errors), number of errors in the
modality comparison test and the attention shift test, and
simple reaction time in the alertness test of the TAP battery.
As only two patients had significantly decreased SERT
binding but normal DAT binding, comparison of their
psychometric results with the control group was not
performed.
When data from the patient groups with altered DAT and
altered DAT and SERT were compared with those of patients
with normal SPECT results, significant differences were
found for the cancelling d test results (percentage of errors
p = 0.011; number of evaluated items minus errors p = 0.015)
for the group with DAT and SERT alteration.
DISCUSSION
Patients evaluated in this study complained of a decline in
cognitive function. In addition, they felt abnormally fatigued,
and some also reported mood alterations with increased
anxiety and depression. They were referred to our clinic to
clarify the cause of their neuropsychiatric symptoms. There
was no indication in any of the patients of the presence of
liver cirrhosis and/or hepatic encephalopathy. Other causes of
cerebral dysfunction were also excluded via a comprehensive
diagnostic workup.
Patients scored significantly worse than healthy controls in
the FIS, HADS, and SF-36. As these measures rely on self
report, the abnormal findings could result from anxiety due
to knowledge of the HCV infection rather than somatic
alterations. However, a study analysing HCV positive patients
unaware of their diagnosis also found them to be impaired
compared with HCV negative controls.14
Previous studies have indicated that approximately half of
HCV positive patients with only mild liver disease complain
of abnormal fatigue, depression, and cognitive dysfunction,
irrespective of their PCR status.2 5 6 10 Evaluation of cognitive
function in HCV positive patients with normal or only mildly
impaired liver function has shown that they suffer from
deficits in attention, learning ability, and memory predomi￾nantly.17 18 Magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies revealed
significant alterations in the choline/creatine and/or N-acetyl￾aspartate/creatine ratio as an indication of cerebral metabolic
alterations whereas MRI was normal.16–19 In agreement with
this, Kramer and colleagues20 were able to show a significant
increase in P300 latency, a measure of stimulus evaluation
processing, in non-cirrhotic hepatitis C patients compared
with healthy controls. Thus there is increasing evidence that
hepatitis C virus infection is accompanied by cerebral
dysfunction in some patients.

Our present findings emphasise this assumption. We have
recently shown that cognitive decline in patients with
hepatitis C is especially due to deficits in attention, higher
executive functions, learning ability, and memory.18 This was
confirmed in the present study. All but two of the 16
evaluated patients showed pathological results in the divided
attention test, and approximately two thirds had pathological
results in the simple and warned reaction time test,
intermodal comparison test, incompatibility test, and atten￾tion shift test. In particular, we observed an above normal
reaction time in most patients. Furthermore, especially in the
divided attention test and the attention shift test, the number
of errors and missings were increased compared with
controls. Therefore, increased reaction times could not be
attributed to motor slowing but to attention deficits. This
assumption is supported by the fact that none of the patients
gained pathological results in the ‘‘serial dotting’’ subtest of
the PSE syndrome test, a test of pure motor speed.
The observations of Jones21 and Piche and colleagues22 that
disabling fatigue can be significantly improved in patients
with chronic hepatitis C by treatment with the 5-hydroxy￾tryptamine-3 receptor antagonist ondansetron suggests a role
for the serotonergic system in the pathophysiology of chronic
fatigue and cognitive decline in HCV infected patients.
Serotonergic neurotransmission can be studied in vivo by
SPECT. I-123-Beta-CIT is normally used for evaluation of
striatal dopamine transporter binding. This tracer however
also binds to serotonin transporters. Due to the fact that high
densities of SERT and DAT are present in different
anatomical locations and because of the different binding
kinetics of I-123-beta-CIT to DAT or SERT, early scans—
performed approximately four hours after injection of the
tracer—can be used to study SERT binding in the hypotha￾lamus/midbrain region while later scans—approximately
24 hours after injection—represent DAT binding in the
striatum.33 34
Using I-123-beta-CIT-SPECT we were able to show
decreased binding capacity of the midbrain serotonin
transporters and/or the striatal dopamine transporters in 14
of the 20 patients examined. Interestingly, those patients
with altered monoamine transporter binding performed
significantly worse than healthy controls in most of the
psychometric tests. Based on these data we conclude that
psychometric alterations in HCV infected patients are related
to alterations in neurotransmission. FIS scores did not
significantly differ between the patient groups. Thus fatigue
seems to be caused by additional factors apart from
monoaminergic dysfunction. This assumption is also sup￾ported by the fact that ondansetron treatment is effective in
only about a third of patients.22
Decreased b-CIT binding, as shown in our patients, may be
due to structural and/or functional alteration of the serotonin
and dopamine transporter or a decrease in the number of
serotonergic or dopaminergic neurones within the region of
interest. As we cannot differentiate between these different
pathologies and also we do not know about the presence and
function of the respective receptors, the mechanisms of
monoaminergic dysfunction in HCV exposed patients cannot
be described in detail.
Dopamine has been shown to be a ‘‘key regulator to adapt
action, emotion, motivation, and cognition’’.35 With regard to
cognition, alteration of striatal dopaminergic neurotransmis￾sion is considered to result in deficits in mental flexibility,
working memory, learning ability, sustained attention,
attention shift, and higher executive functions.36–38
In common with dopamine, serotonin is also involved in
the modulation of perception, attention, emotion, and
cognition.39 The vast majority of serotonergic neurones are
located in the brainstem. The rostral group, which includes
the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, is reciprocally connected
to several cortical areas, especially the medial prefrontal
cortex.40 41 This region is associated with a large number of
cognitive functions and is involved in the planning and
execution of complex tasks. Dorsal raphe neurones are also
involved in the modulation of the sleep-waking cycle, major

depression, suicidal behaviour, and aggressive and anxiety
behaviour.40 According to Severson and colleagues,42 seroton￾ergic neurones located in the midbrain maintain pH home￾ostasis by inducing arousal, anxiety, and changes in
cerebrovascular tone. Structural or functional alterations of
these neurones are considered to be the cause of otherwise
unrelated diseases such as sudden infant death syndrome,
panic disorder, and migraine.
It must be emphasised that four of the 20 patients
examined were PCR negative. These four patients did not
differ from the PCR positive patients with regard to their
clinical presentation, neuropsychological findings, or SPECT
results. Thus it could be questioned whether the neuropsy￾chiatric symptoms and alterations in neurotransmission
found in our patients are a consequence of their HCV
infection. However, it is well known from previous studies
that chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and a decrease in
quality of life are independent of the grade of liver disease or
the virus replication rate.10 12–15 Also, there is increasing
evidence that the virus may enter the brain via lympho- or
monocytic blood cells.43 In common with HIV infection, the
‘‘Trojan horse’’ hypothesis must be considered in HCV
infection. The virus enters the brain in blood derived
macrophagic cells, is hosted by microglial cells, and alters
the function of these microglial cells thereby inducing
neuronal dysfunction.44 Radkowski and colleagues45 and
Forton and colleagues46 provided evidence that the CNS is a
site of HCV replication and that within the CNS virus
replication occurs at a lower level than in the liver. In
addition, they showed that different HCV quasispecies may
be present within brain tissue and serum. Thereby the
responsiveness of brain and liver hosted virus to any antiviral
therapy may be different, and while there is no evidence of
viral replication in serum, the virus may persist in the brain
and alter neuronal function.
In conclusion, some HCV infected patients with normal
liver function show alterations in both the midbrain
serotonergic and striatal dopaminergic systems, irrespective
of their PCR status. In addition, these patients show
alterations of mood and cognition consistent with impaired
dopaminergic and serotonergic function (that is, depression,
anxiety, and marked attention deficits). Thus the present
findings implicate a role for altered monoaminergic neuro￾transmission in the pathophysiology of cerebral dysfunction
concomitant with HCV infection. Even the less frequently
reported symptoms nausea, migraine-like headaches,
increased or decreased food intake, or aggressive behaviour,
which are part of the ‘‘encephalopathy’’ associated with HCV
infection, may be explained by these findings. Further studies
should be performed aiming for both detection of the causes
of these alterations at the cellular level and development of
adequate treatment strategies.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 1605
Further investigations showed strongly positive antinuclear antibody (1600) titre and
positive anti Ds-DNA. Her complement C3 and C4 were low, 24 hour urinary albumin was
2.4 g, and creatinine clearance was low. An ophthalmological examination revealed focal
chorioretinitis.
A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was made and mycophenolate along
with oral prednisolone were started with good clinical and radiological response.
SLE can present with ascites, rectal ulcer, pancreatitis, multiple colonic ulcers, protein
loosing enteropathy, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first described report of SLE presenting as an isolated terminal ileal
ulcer. This report highlights that although the commonest cause of terminal ileal ulceration
is Crohn’s disease, other causes such as collagen vascular disease should be considered along
with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, Yesinia infection, tuberculosis, and
lymphoma.
