Introduction
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have become increasingly
important in health care. Clinicians read them to keep up to date
with their field [1,2], and they are often used as a starting point for
developing clinical practice guidelines. Granting agencies may
require a systematic review to ensure there is justification for
further research [3], and some health care journals are moving in
this direction [4]. As with all research, the value of a systematic
review depends on what was done, what was found, and the clarity
of reporting. As with other publications, the reporting quality of
systematic reviews varies, limiting readers’ ability to assess the
strengths and weaknesses of those reviews.
Several early studies evaluated the quality of review reports. In
1987, Mulrow examined 50 review articles published in four leading
medical journals in 1985 and 1986 and found that none met all eight
explicit scientific criteria, such as a quality assessment of included
studies [5]. In 1987, Sacks and colleagues [6] evaluated the adequacy
of reporting of 83 meta-analyses on 23 characteristics in six domains.
Reporting was generally poor; between one and 14 characteristics
were adequately reported (mean = 7.7; standard deviation = 2.7). A
1996 update of this study found little improvement [7].
In 1996, to address the suboptimal reporting of meta-analyses,
an international group developed a guidance called the
QUOROM Statement (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses),
which focused on the reporting of meta-analyses of randomized
controlled trials [8]. In this article, we summarize a revision of
these guidelines, renamed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), which have been
updated to address several conceptual and practical advances in
the science of systematic reviews (Box 1).
Terminology
The terminology used to describe a systematic review and meta￾analysis has evolved over time. One reason for changing the name
from QUOROM to PRISMA was the desire to encompass both
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We have adopted the
definitions used by the Cochrane Collaboration [9]. A systematic
review is a review of a clearly formulated question that uses
systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically
appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from
the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods
(meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyze and summarize
the results of the included studies. Meta-analysis refers to the use of
statistical techniques in a systematic review to integrate the results
of included studies.
Developing the PRISMA Statement
A three-day meeting was held in Ottawa, Canada, in June 2005
with 29 participants, including review authors, methodologists,
clinicians, medical editors, and a consumer. The objective of the
Ottawa meeting was to revise and expand the QUOROM
checklist and flow diagram, as needed.
The executive committee completed the following tasks, prior to
the meeting: a systematic review of studies examining the quality
of reporting of systematic reviews, and a comprehensive literature
search to identify methodological and other articles that might
inform the meeting, especially in relation to modifying checklist
items. An international survey of review authors, consumers, and
groups commissioning or using systematic reviews and meta￾analyses was completed, including the International Network of
Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) and the
Guidelines International Network (GIN). The survey aimed to
ascertain views of QUOROM, including the merits of the existing
checklist items. The results of these activities were presented
during the meeting and are summarized on the PRISMA Web site
(http://www.prisma-statement.org/).
Only items deemed essential were retained or added to the
checklist. Some additional items are nevertheless desirable, and
review authors should include these, if relevant [10]. For example,
it is useful to indicate whether the systematic review is an update
[11] of a previous review, and to describe any changes in
procedures from those described in the original protocol.

Shortly after the meeting a draft of the PRISMA checklist was
circulated to the group, including those invited to the meeting but
unable to attend. A disposition file was created containing
comments and revisions from each respondent, and the checklist
was subsequently revised 11 times. The group approved the
checklist, flow diagram, and this summary paper.
Although no direct evidence was found to support retaining or
adding some items, evidence from other domains was believed to
be relevant. For example, Item 5 asks authors to provide
registration information about the systematic review, including a
registration number, if available. Although systematic review
registration is not yet widely available [12,13], the participating
journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors (ICMJE) [14] now require all clinical trials to be registered
in an effort to increase transparency and accountability [15].
Those aspects are also likely to benefit systematic reviewers,
possibly reducing the risk of an excessive number of reviews
addressing the same question [16,17] and providing greater
transparency when updating systematic reviews.
The PRISMA Statement
The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist (Table 1;
see also Text S1 for a downloadable Word template for researchers
to re-use) and a four-phase flow diagram (Figure 1; see also Figure
S1 for a downloadable Word template for researchers to re-use).
The aim of the PRISMA Statement is to help authors improve the
reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We have focused
on randomized trials, but PRISMA can also be used as a basis for
reporting systematic reviews of other types of research, particularly
evaluations of interventions. PRISMA may also be useful for critical
appraisal of published systematic reviews. However, the PRISMA
checklist is not a quality assessment instrument to gauge the quality
of a systematic review.
From QUOROM to PRISMA
The new PRISMA checklist differs in several respects from the
QUOROM checklist, and the substantive specific changes are
highlighted in Table 2. Generally, the PRISMA checklist
‘‘decouples’’ several items present in the QUOROM checklist
and, where applicable, several checklist items are linked to
improve consistency across the systematic review report.
The flow diagram has also been modified. Before including
studies and providing reasons for excluding others, the review
team must first search the literature. This search results in records.
Once these records have been screened and eligibility criteria
applied, a smaller number of articles will remain. The number of
included articles might be smaller (or larger) than the number of
studies, because articles may report on multiple studies and results
from a particular study may be published in several articles. To
capture this information, the PRISMA flow diagram now requests
information on these phases of the review process.
Endorsement
The PRISMA Statement should replace the QUOROM State￾ment for those journals that have endorsed QUOROM. We hope
that other journalswill support PRISMA;they can do so by registering
on the PRISMA Web site. To underscore to authors, and others, the
importance of transparent reporting of systematic reviews, we
encourage supporting journals to reference the PRISMA Statement
and include the PRISMA Web address in their Instructions to
Authors. We also invite editorial organizations to consider endorsing
PRISMA and encourage authors to adhere to its principles.
The PRISMA Explanation and Elaboration Paper
In addition to the PRISMA Statement, a supporting Explana￾tion and Elaboration document has been produced [18] following
the style used for other reporting guidelines [19–21]. The process
Box 1: Conceptual Issues in the Evolution from
QUOROM to PRISMA
Completing a Systematic Review Is an Iterative
Process The conduct of a systematic review depends
heavily on the scope and quality of included studies: thus
systematic reviewers may need to modify their original
review protocol during its conduct. Any systematic review
reporting guideline should recommend that such changes
can be reported and explained without suggesting that
they are inappropriate. The PRISMA Statement (Items 5, 11,
16, and 23) acknowledges this iterative process. Aside from
Cochrane reviews, all of which should have a protocol,
only about 10% of systematic reviewers report working
from a protocol [22]. Without a protocol that is publicly
accessible, it is difficult to judge between appropriate and
inappropriate modifications.
Conduct and Reporting Research Are Distinct
Concepts This distinction is, however, less
straightforward for systematic reviews than for
assessments of the reporting of an individual study,
because the reporting and conduct of systematic reviews
are, by nature, closely intertwined. For example, the failure
of a systematic review to report the assessment of the risk
of bias in included studies may be seen as a marker of poor
conduct, given the importance of this activity in the
systematic review process [37].
Study-Level Versus Outcome-Level Assessment of
Risk of Bias For studies included in a systematic review, a
thorough assessment of the risk of bias requires both a
‘‘study-level’’ assessment (e.g., adequacy of allocation
concealment) and, for some features, a newer approach
called ‘‘outcome-level’’ assessment. An outcome-level
assessment involves evaluating the reliability and validity
of the data for each important outcome by determining
the methods used to assess them in each individual study
[38]. The quality of evidence may differ across outcomes,
even within a study, such as between a primary efficacy
outcome, which is likely to be very carefully and
systematically measured, and the assessment of serious
harms [39], which may rely on spontaneous reports by
investigators. This information should be reported to allow
an explicit assessment of the extent to which an estimate
of effect is correct [38].
Importance of Reporting Biases Different types of
reporting biases may hamper the conduct and
interpretation of systematic reviews. Selective reporting
of complete studies (e.g., publication bias) [28] as well as
the more recently empirically demonstrated ‘‘outcome
reporting bias’’ within individual studies [40,41] should be
considered by authors when conducting a systematic
review and reporting its results. Though the implications of
these biases on the conduct and reporting of systematic
reviews themselves are unclear, some previous research
has identified that selective outcome reporting may occur
also in the context of systematic reviews [42].
PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 2 July 2009 | Volume 6 | Issue 7 | e1000097

of completing this document included developing a large database
of exemplars to highlight how best to report each checklist item,
and identifying a comprehensive evidence base to support the
inclusion of each checklist item. The Explanation and Elaboration
document was completed after several face to face meetings and
numerous iterations among several meeting participants, after
which it was shared with the whole group for additional revisions
and final approval. Finally, the group formed a dissemination
subcommittee to help disseminate and implement PRISMA.
Discussion
The quality of reporting of systematic reviews is still not
optimal [22–27]. In a recent review of 300 systematic reviews,
few authors reported assessing possible publication bias [22],
even though there is overwhelming evidence both for its
existence [28] and its impact on the results of systematic
reviews [29]. Even when the possibility of publication bias is
assessed, there is no guarantee that systematic reviewers have
assessed or interpreted it appropriately [30]. Although the
absence of reporting such an assessment does not necessarily
indicate that it was not done, reporting an assessment of possible
publication bias is likely to be a marker of the thoroughness of
the conduct of the systematic review.
Several approaches have been developed to conduct systematic
reviews on a broader array of questions. For example, systematic
reviews are now conducted to investigate cost-effectiveness [31],
diagnostic [32] or prognostic questions [33], genetic associations
[34], and policy making [35]. The general concepts and topics
covered by PRISMA are all relevant to any systematic review, not
just those whose objective is to summarize the benefits and harms
of a health care intervention. However, some modifications of the
checklist items or flow diagram will be necessary in particular
circumstances. For example, assessing the risk of bias is a key
concept, but the items used to assess this in a diagnostic review are
likely to focus on issues such as the spectrum of patients and the
verification of disease status, which differ from reviews of
interventions. The flow diagram will also need adjustments when
reporting individual patient data meta-analysis [36].
We have developed an explanatory document [18] to increase
the usefulness of PRISMA. For each checklist item, this document
contains an example of good reporting, a rationale for its inclusion,
and supporting evidence, including references, whenever possible.
We believe this document will also serve as a useful resource for
those teaching systematic review methodology. We encourage
journals to include reference to the explanatory document in their
Instructions to Authors.
Like any evidence-based endeavor, PRISMA is a living
document. To this end we invite readers to comment on the
revised version, particularly the new checklist and flow diagram,
through the PRISMA Web site. We will use such information to
inform PRISMA’s continued development.

Table 2. Substantive specific changes between the QUOROM checklist and the PRISMA checklist (a tick indicates the presence of
the topic in QUOROM or PRISMA).
Section/Topic Item QUOROM PRISMA Comment
Abstract ! ! QUOROM and PRISMA ask authors to report an abstract. However, PRISMA is not
specific about format.
Introduction Objective ! This new item (4) addresses the explicit question the review addresses using the PICO
reporting system (which describes the participants, interventions, comparisons, and
outcome(s) of the systematic review), together with the specification of the type of
study design (PICOS); the item is linked to Items 6, 11, and 18 of the checklist.
Methods Protocol ! This new item (5) asks authors to report whether the review has a protocol and if so
how it can be accessed.
Methods Search ! ! Although reporting the search is present in both QUOROM and PRISMA checklists,
PRISMA asks authors to provide a full description of at least one electronic search
strategy (Item 8). Without such information it is impossible to repeat the authors’
search.
Methods Assessment of
risk of bias in
included studies
! ! Renamed from ‘‘quality assessment’’ in QUOROM. This item (12) is linked with
reporting this information in the results (Item 19). The new concept of ‘‘outcome￾level’’ assessment has been introduced.
Methods Assessment of
risk of bias across
studies
! This new item (15) asks authors to describe any assessments of risk of bias in the
review, such as selective reporting within the included studies. This item is linked
with reporting this information in the results (Item 22).
Discussion ! ! Although both QUOROM and PRISMA checklists address the discussion section,
PRISMA devotes three items (24–26) to the discussion. In PRISMA the main types of
limitations are explicitly stated and their discussion required.
Funding ! This new item (27) asks authors to provide information on any sources of funding for
the systematic review.
