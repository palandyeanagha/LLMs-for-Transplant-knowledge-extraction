Memory CD8 T cells are a critical component of protective
immunity, and inducing effective memory T-cell responses is a
major goal of vaccines against chronic infections and tumours1–3.
Considerable effort has gone into designing vaccine regimens that
will increase the magnitude of the memory response, but there has
been minimal emphasis on developing strategies to improve the
functional qualities of memory T cells4
. Here we show that mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin5
, also known as FRAP1) is a
major regulator of memory CD8 T-cell differentiation, and in
contrast to what we expected, the immunosuppressive drug rapa￾mycin has immunostimulatory effects on the generation of
memory CD8 T cells. Treatment of mice with rapamycin following
acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection enhanced not
only the quantity but also the quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells.
Similar effects were seen after immunization of mice with a vac￾cine based on non-replicating virus-like particles. In addition,
rapamycin treatment also enhanced memory T-cell responses in
non-human primates following vaccination with modified vac￾cinia virus Ankara. Rapamycin was effective during both the
expansion and contraction phases of the T-cell response; during
the expansion phase it increased the number of memory precur￾sors, and during the contraction phase (effector to memory transi￾tion) it accelerated the memory T-cell differentiation program.
Experiments using RNA interference to inhibit expression of
mTOR, raptor (also known as 4932417H02Rik) or FKBP12 (also
known as FKBP1A) in antigen-specific CD8 T cells showed that
mTOR acts intrinsically through the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1)
pathway to regulate memory T-cell differentiation. Thus these
studies identify a molecular pathway regulating memory forma￾tion and provide an effective strategy for improving the functional
qualities of vaccine- or infection-induced memory T cells.
Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug commonly used in trans￾plant recipients and specifically inhibits the intracellular kinase
mTOR5
. Several recent studies have shown that rapamycin has various
effects on the immune system, such as inhibiting type I interferon
production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells6
, modulating T-cell traf￾ficking7
, and regulating Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells8,9.
However, the role of the mTOR pathway in regulating CD8 T-cell
responses is not known. To address this issue, we treated B6 mice with
rapamycin during the course of an acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) infection, and monitored the virus-specific CD8 T-cell
response (Fig. 1a).We made the surprising observation that rapamycin
enhanced the LCMV-specific CD8 T-cell response. Increased numbers
of antigen-specific CD8 T cells were seen in both lymphoid and non￾lymphoid tissues (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). The most notable
thing about this result was the decreased contraction of the T-cell
response in the rapamycin treated group. Similar frequencies of
virus-specific effector CD8 T cells were observed in both groups of mice
at the peak of the T-cell response on day 8 post-infection, but there was
minimal contraction of the T cells in the rapamycin treated group
(Fig. 1a). To determine whether the decreased T-cell contraction seen
between days 8 to 30 post-infection in the rapamycin treated group was
due to increased cell proliferation and/or reduced cell death, mice were
infected with LCMV in the presence or absence of rapamycin and then
given 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) during the T-cell contraction
phase from days 10 to 22 (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that there
was minimal incorporation of BrdU by antigen-specific CD8 T cells in
either group of mice, showing that the decreased contraction of T cells
in the presence of rapamycin was not due to increased cell proliferation.
Thus, it appears that the major effect of rapamycin is to enhance the
survival of antigen-specific CD8 T cells.
We next examined the phenotype of the memory CD8 T cells
present in the two groups of mice at day 36 post-infection (Fig. 1b).
To investigate this, we performed phenotypic analysis of virus￾specific memory CD8 T cells using four markers that are useful in
defining memory CD8 T cells: CD127 (IL-7 receptor a and essential
for memory T-cell maintenance10–13), CD62L (lymph node homing
receptor and associated with high proliferative capacity14), KLRG1
(inversely correlated with long lived memory cells15,16), and Bcl2
(anti-apoptotic and expressed at high levels in memory T cells12,17).
Memory CD8 T cells generated in the presence of rapamycin
expressed higher levels of CD127, CD62L and Bcl2, and had a higher
frequency of KLRG1Low cells compared to control mice (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 3). These data strongly suggested that inhibition
of the mTOR pathway using rapamycin not only increased the mag￾nitude of the virus-specific CD8 T-cell response (Fig. 1a) but also
improved the functional qualities of the memory CD8 T cells, as
memory cells with the phenotype (CD127High CD62LHigh Bcl2High
and KLRG1Low) are associated with long-lived protective immun￾ity14–16. To test this directly, we examined the ability of these memory
CD8 T cells to undergo homeostatic proliferation, a property essen￾tial for long-term memory maintenance, and to make recall res￾ponses upon re-exposure to antigen. As shown in Fig. 1c and d,
virus-specific memory CD8 T cells generated in mice treated with
rapamycin were superior to memory cells generated in untreated
mice in both of these hallmark memory properties.
In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, mice were continuously treated
with rapamycin during the entire course of the T-cell response (days
21 to 35 post-infection). We next examined how rapamycin would
effect the CD8 T-cell response if it was only given during the T-cell
expansion phase (days 21 to 8 post-infection). These results (Fig. 2a
and b) were strikingly similar to what we had seen earlier (Fig. 1a);
even if the rapamycin treatment was discontinued during the con￾traction phase (days 8–30), there was only minimal death of the
effector CD8 T cells generated in the presence of the drug. Previous
studies have shown that the day 8 effector CD8 T-cell population
consists of two subsets; the terminal effector T cells (CD127Low,
KLRG1High) that mostly die over the ensuing 2–4 weeks and the
memory precursor cells (CD127High, KLRG1Low) that mostly survive
and further differentiate to give rise to the pool of long-lived memory

cells10,15,16. Our results suggested that rapamycin was enhancing the
formation of these memory precursor cells. This was indeed the case,
and day 8 virus-specific effector CD8 T cells generated in rapamycin
treated mice contained a higher proportion of CD127HighKLRG1Low
cells and these cells also expressed higher levels of Bcl2 (Fig. 2c).
However, we noticed that the phenotype of memory CD8 T cells at
day 36 post-infection was similar in the drug treated and control mice
(Fig. 2d). This was different to the results obtained on continuous
rapamycin treatment (compare Fig. 1b and Fig. 2d). Taken together,
these results clearly show that rapamycin enhances the formation of
memory precursors during the naive to effector T-cell differentiation
phase, but these results also suggest that rapamycin may also regulate
the effector to memory transition phase.
To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with rapamycin only during
the T-cell contraction phase (days 8–35) following acute LCMV infec￾tion (Fig. 3). We found that the number of memory cells generated
was not affected by the drug (Fig. 3a) but the phenotype of these
memory CD8 T cells was notably different (Fig. 3b). Thus, rapamycin
treatment during the effector to memory transition phase enhanced
the memory differentiation program, resulting in a significantly
higher number of virus-specific CD8 T cells with the phenotype char￾acteristic of highly functional memory cells (P , 0.0001–0.0022;
Fig. 3b). It was important to determine if this represented cell prolif￾eration and outgrowth of a subset of effector CD8 T cells already
expressing these memory markers, or if rapamycin truly increased
the expression of these markers in the surviving effector T cells during
this effector to memory differentiation phase. To address this issue, we
transferred a highly purified (.99.7%) and CFSE-labelled population
of day 8 CD62LLow antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells into naive
mice, and monitored both cell division and memory differentiation of
these transferred effector cells in the presence or absence of rapamycin
(Fig. 3c). We found that there was no cell division during this effector
to memory transition phase (days 1–25 post-transfer) but that the
memory T cells that differentiated in the presence of rapamycin re￾expressed CD62L much faster (Fig. 3d and e).More importantly, these
memory CD8 T cells were functionally superior and exhibited better
recall responses and protective immunity (viral control) following
challenge with vaccinia virus expressing the LCMV GP33 epitope
(Fig. 3f–h). Thus, inhibiting mTOR during the effector to memory
transition phase improved the functional qualities of memory T cells.
The results so far have shown that rapamycin can enhance both
the magnitude and quality of the CD8 T-cell response following a

primary viral infection. We next examined whether similar effects
would be seen during a secondary response. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 4, rapamycin also enhanced recall responses
when the drug treatment was only done during secondary LCMV
infection. Thus, rapamycin regulates both primary and secondary
T-cell responses, and this has important implications in designing
strategies for improving memory T-cell qualities during prime-boost
vaccine regimens.
To determine if our findings from the mouse model of LCMV
infection could be generalized to other systems, we examined the
effect of rapamycin following immunization of mice with a non￾replicating vaccine. In these experiments, mice were vaccinated with
virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from hepatitis B core antigen
genetically fused to the LCMV GP33 epitope18. Rapamycin again
enhanced both the magnitude and the quality of the VLP-induced
memory CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). It should be noted that
the effects of rapamycin treatment were very long-lasting; memory
T-cell numbers remained tenfold higher even 165 days after stopping
the drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We also tested the
applicability of this approach in a non-human primate model.
Rhesus macaques previously immunized with vaccinia virus were
boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) in the presence
or absence of rapamycin, and antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses
were analysed by intracellular IFN-c staining. We found clear differ￾ences in frequencies of antigen-specific CD8 T cells between rapamy￾cin treated and untreated monkeys. In the presence of rapamycin,
maintenance of a higher number of memory CD8 T cells was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), and slower T-cell contraction
was evident compared to control animals (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
These results demonstrate that rapamycin enhances T-cell immunity
in both mice and non-human primates following vaccination with
either live or inactivated vaccines.
Our results clearly establish that mTOR is a major regulator of
memory CD8 T-cell differentiation. However, a critical question that
needs to be answered is whether mTOR is acting intrinsically in
antigen-specific CD8 T cells to regulate memory differentiation, or
if the observed effects of rapamycin on memory formation are
mediated by some other cells of the immune system. It is important
to resolve this issue, as mTOR is ubiquitously expressed by many cells
and several recent studies have shown that rapamycin can modulate
the functional properties of several other cells of the immune sys￾tem6,8,9,19,20. To address this question, we used a retrovirus based RNA

interference (RNAi) system to specifically knockdown various genes
of the mTOR pathway (mTOR, raptor, S6K1 (also known as
Rps6kb1), Eif4e and Fkbp12) in antigen-specific CD8 T cells.
Retroviruses marked by GFP and expressing RNAi for a particular
gene or a control retrovirus were used to infect LCMV specific trans￾genic CD8 T cells (P14 cells); these transduced cells were then adop￾tively transferred into naive mice, followed by LCMV infection
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). This system allows us to compare the
phenotypic changes that occur during memory T-cell differentiation
in GFP1 retrovirus transduced versus GFP2 non-transduced anti￾gen-specific CD8 T cells in the same environment (that is, the same
mouse; Supplementary Fig. 7b). Thus, any differences in memory
differentiation that are seen between these two cell populations can
be ascribed to the intrinsic effects of that particular gene in antigen￾specific T cells.
In the initial set of experiments, we knocked down mTOR itself in
antigen-specific CD8 T cells. We found that mTOR RNAi retrovirus￾transduced GFP1 P14 cells showed significantly higher expression of
the canonical memory T-cell markers (CD127, CD62L, Bcl2, CD27)
and lower expression of KLRG1 compared to non-transduced or
control vector transduced P14 cells (Fig. 4a). These data show that
mTOR acts intrinsically in antigen-specific CD8 T cells to regulate
memory differentiation. However, as mTOR forms two distinct com￾plexes, the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and
the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC25
, mTOR knockdown does not
completely mimic rapamycin treatment. To distinguish between
these two pathways, we knocked down the gene, raptor, that is an
essential component of the mTORC1 complex21,22. As shown in
Fig. 4b, inhibition of raptor in antigen-specific T cells gave results
identical to those seen on knockdown of mTOR, thereby identifying
the mTORC1 complex as the regulator of memory differentiation. To
gain more insight into mechanisms by which mTOR regulates mem￾ory formation, we examined the role of S6K1 and eIF4E5
. We found
that knockdown of these mTORC1 downstream effectors signifi￾cantly enhanced memory CD8 T-cell differentiation (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 8). Thus, our results show that mTOR is exerting its effect
through these two downstream molecules.
To further explore the role of mTOR in T-cell intrinsic versus
external effects on memory differentiation, we made rapamycin￾insensitive antigen-specific CD8 T cells by knockdown of the
FKBP12 protein. This intracellular protein binds rapamycin and it
is this FKBP12–rapamycin complex that inhibits the mTORC1 path￾way. Thus, by knocking down FKBP12 in P14 CD8 cells, we made
these cells insensitive to any intrinsic effects of rapamycin but the

drug could still act effectively on all the other cells in the mouse. This
system allows us to examine if inhibition of mTOR in other cells can
effect memory CD8 T-cell differentiation. As shown in Fig. 4c, inhibi￾ting mTOR in other cells when the antigen-specific cells themselves
were rapamycin insensitive did not effect memory differentiation.
The effect of rapamycin on memory differentiation almost disap￾peared on knockdown of FKBP12 from the P14 cells, and these cells
did not show increased expression of the characteristic memory mar￾kers (CD127, CD62L, Bcl2, and so on; see rightmost column in
Fig. 4c). Thus, taken together, the results shown in Fig. 4a–c establish
that mTOR not only acts intrinsically in antigen-specific CD8 T cells
but that inhibiting mTOR in other cells has minimal to no effect on
memory T-cell differentiation.
During the past few years, considerable progress has been made in
understanding the lineage relationships between naive, effector and
memory T cells and in defining the phenotypic and functional
changes that underlie memory CD8 T-cell differentiation1,23.
However, much less is known about the intracellular molecules
and pathways that regulate the generation of memory T cells. In this
study, we identify a molecular pathway that regulates memory T-cell
differentiation, and provide a strategy for modulating the formation
of memory cells. In particular, the ability to increase the functional
qualities of memory T cells provides a new approach for enhancing
the efficacy of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.
METHODS SUMMARY
Mice, viral infection, and VLP. C57BL/6j mice and Thy-1.1 P14 transgenic mice
bearing the H-2Db GP33 epitope specific TCR were used. Mice were intraper￾itoneally (i.p.) infected with LCMV Armstrong or recombinant vaccinia virus
GP33 (VVGP33), which expresses the LCMV GP33 epitope. For VLP immun￾ization, mice were subcutaneously given VLP genetically fused to LCMV GP33
epitope18.
Rhesus macaques and vaccination. Six rhesus macaques were inoculated with
Dryvax (Wyeth) by scarification. At 105 days post Dryvax vaccination, animals
were then vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with MVA.
Administration of rapamycin. For the murine experiments, rapamycin
(Wyeth) was administered i.p. daily. A relatively low dose of rapamycin was used
during T-cell expansion phase because the higher dose inhibited T-cell responses
(Supplementary Fig. 9). For the rhesus macaque experiments, rapamycin was
administered daily i.m. to Dryvax immunized animals before MVA vaccination.
Generation and isolation of effector and memory T-cell subsets. Naive P14
transgenic T cells were adoptively transferred into B6 recipients (P14 chimaeric
mice). Effector and memory P14 T cells were isolated from LCMV-infected P14
chimaeric mice. CD62L2 effector CD8 T cells were purified using anti-CD62L
magnetic beads and a CD8 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec).
Retrovirus based RNAi. The pMKO.1 GFP retroviral vector (Addgene plasmid
10676) was provided by W. Hahn. Double strand oligonucleotides for short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) were cloned into pMKO.1 GFP. Recombinant retrovirus
was made by transfection in 293T cells. Retrovirus transduced P14 cells were
adoptively transferred into naive mice, then the mice were infected with LCMV
Armstrong. The GFP1 P14 CD8 T cells were purified by FACS on day 7–8 post￾infection, and then protein expression levels were analysed by western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. 10).

METHODS
Mice, viral infection, VLP, and virus titrations. Twelve- to sixteen-week old
C57BL/6j mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Thy-1.1 P14
transgenic mice bearing the DbGP33 specific TCR were fully backcrossed to
C57BL/6 mice in our animal colony. LCMV Armstrong (2 3 105 p.f.u., i.p.)
and recombinant vaccinia virus GP33 (VVGP33, 5 3 106 p.f.u., i.p.), which
expresses the LCMV GP33 epitope, were used for infection. VVGP33 titres were
determined in the ovary by plaque assay as described previously14. For VLP
immunization, mice were subcutaneously given 50 mg of VLP, which was derived
from the hepatitis B core antigen genetically fused to the LCMV gp33-41 epitope
(KAVYNFATM) and packaged with CpG-ODN.
Administration of rapamycin in mice. Rapamycin (Wyeth) was administered
to mice i.p. daily during the treatment period. Three different treatment periods
were used: (1) throughout LCMV infection (day 21 before infection to the
memory phase, day 35 post-infection); (2) the T-cell expansion phase (day 21
before infection to day 8 post-infection); or (3) T-cell contraction phase (day 8 to
the memory phase, day 35 post-infection). The daily dose of rapamycin was
75 mg kg21 (blood levels; 5–20 ng ml21
) for treatments (1) and (2), and
600 mg kg21 (blood levels; 40–100 ng ml21
) for treatment (3) (the contraction
phase treatment) because the higher dose (600 mg kg21
) inhibits T-cell responses
during the expansion phase of the CD8 T-cell response (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Control mice received sham treatment during the same time periods described
above (daily of injection of the buffer without rapamycin).
Rhesus macaques and vaccination. Six rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were
inoculated with Dryvax (Wyeth) by scarification in accordance with the US Food
and Drug Administration guidelines. Briefly, a bifurcated needle was immersed
in the vaccine suspension and used to poke the skin 15 consecutive times. At 105
days post Dryvax vaccination, animals were vaccinated with 108 p.f.u. MVA i.m.
Administration of rapamycin in rhesus macaques. Daily administration of
rapamycin (10–50 mg kg21 d21
) was giveni.m. to three of the six Dryvax immunized
rhesus macaques around 5 days before MVA vaccination. Blood levels of rapamycin
were maintained within a range of 5–15 ng ml21
. The other three macaques were left
untreated as controls.
Generation and isolation of effector and memory T-cell subsets. To generate
LCMV specific P14 effector T cells, mice into which 1 3 105 P14 naive T cells
were adoptively transferred were infected with LCMV. On day 8 post-infection,
effector P14 cells were isolated from the spleen, and CD62L2 CD8 T cells were
purified using anti-CD62L magnetic beads and a CD8 T cell isolation kit
(Miltenyi Biotec). These cells were then used for a CD62L conversion experiment
and a protective immune response experiment. For the CD62L conversion
experiment, CFSE labelled CD62L2 P14 effector cells (7–10 3 106 cells) were
adoptively transferred into naive mice. For the protective immune response
experiment, 3 3 105 CD62L2 P14 effector cells were adoptively transferred into
naive mice, and rapamycin was administered for 25 days. On day 28 post￾transfer, mice were challenged with VVGP33 to examine protective immune res￾ponses. To obtain memory P14 cells generated in rapamycin treated mice, B6 mice
into which 1 3 105 P14 naive T cells were adoptively transferred were infected with
LCMV, and these mice were then treated with rapamycin from day 21 to day 33
post-infection. On day 34 post-infection, memory P14 T cells generated in the
presence of rapamycin were isolated from the spleen. Control memory P14 cells
were obtained using the same method without the rapamycin treatment. For the
homeostatic experiment, CFSE labelled memory P14 cells (13 106 cells) obtained
from either rapamycin treated or untreated mice were adoptively transferred into
separate naive recipients. For the recall response experiment, 1 3 104 P14 memory
T cells derived from either rapamycin treated or untreated mice were adoptively
transferred into separate naive mice, and the day after transfer these mice were
then infected with VVGP33. To investigate effects of rapamycin during secondary
T-cell responses, 2.53 104 P14 memory T cells (.60 days post-infection) were
adoptively transferred into naive mice, and rapamycin treatment was started. The
day after transfer, these mice were infected LCMV.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a LSRII, a CantoII,
or a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). MHC class I tetramers were made as
described previously24. All antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from
BD biosciences except for CD127, KLRG1 and CD27. Antibodies to CD127 and
CD27 were purchased from eBiosciences and anti-KLRG1 was purchased from
Southern biotech. Single cell suspensions of spleen cells, lymph nodes, livers or
PBMCs from mice were prepared and direct ex vivo staining was carried out as
described previously14. For in vivo BrdU incorporation, LCMV-infected mice
were fed 0.8 mg ml21 BrdU in their drinking water every day. BrdU in virus￾specific CD8 T cells was measured by a BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences), accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. To detect vaccinia virus specific CD8 T
cells generated in rhesus macaques, 1.5 3 106 PBMCs isolated by density gra￾dient centrifugation were incubated at 37 uC for 15 h with vaccinia virus at a
multiplicity of infection of 1 in a volume of 300 ml RPMI containing 10% heat
inactivated FBS. Brefeldin A (5 mg ml21
) was added for the final 5 h of incuba￾tion. IFN-c producing vaccinia virus specific CD8 T cells were detected by
intracellular cytokine staining.
Retrovirus based RNAi. The pMKO.1 GFP retroviral vector (Addgene plasmid
10676) was kindly provided by W. Hahn. Double strand oligonucleotides for
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against mTOR, raptor, Fkbp12, S6K1 and Eif4e were
cloned into pMKO.1 GFP between AgeI and EcoRI sites. The sequences for
mTOR shRNA are: 59-CCGGGCCAGAATCCATCCATTCATTCTCGAGAAT
GAATGGATGGATTCTGGCTTTTTG-39 (sense strand) and 59-AATTCAAAA

CTATCTTCGG-39 (antisense strand). Recombinant retrovirus was made by co￾transfection with pMKO.1 GFP and pCL-Eco (Imgenex) in 293T cells using
TransIT-293 (Mirus). 48 h after transfection culture supernatants were collected.
To transduce P14 cells with the recombinant retrovirus, P14 transgenic mice were
infected with 13 106 p.f.u. of LCMV intravenously and 24 h later, P14 transgenic
spleen cells were isolated and then spin-transduced at 37 uC for 90 min with freshly
collected retrovirus containing 8 mg ml21 of polybrene (Sigma). 5 3 105 retroviral
transduced P14 spleen cells were adoptively transferred into naive mice,followed by
LCMV infection (2 3 105 p.f.u., i.p.). The GFP1 P14 CD8 T cells were purified by
FACS on day 7–8 post infection, and then protein expression levels were analysed by
western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Statistical analysis. For the statistical analysis of the RNAi experiments, a two￾tailed paired Student’s t test was used. To determine the statistical significance of
the viral titres, we used an non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. All other stat￾istical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test.
