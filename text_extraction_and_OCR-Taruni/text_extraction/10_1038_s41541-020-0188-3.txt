COVID-19 vaccines: breaking record times to first-in-human
trials

The twenty-first century has come with a new era in vaccinology, in which recombinant genetic technology has contributed to
setting an unprecedented fast pace in vaccine development, clearly demonstrated during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 15th April 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has reported over 1.7 million cases of
COVID-19 and 100,000 deaths worldwide1
. The virus can be
transmitted by patients with or with no symptomatology, thus
making the control of this disease outbreak a challenging task due
to the lack of a specific treatment or vaccine2
. Without an
efficacious licensed vaccine, control of the pandemic relies on self￾isolation to prevent close contact with other people and basic
measures such as hand washing. Quarantine is efficacious but
causes major disruption to the economy of people and countries3
.
Therefore, development of a safe and effective vaccine against
COVID-19 is an urgent public health priority.
Over the last century, control of epidemics has been achieved
successfully thanks to vaccines developed using various technolo￾gies, predominantly by classic pathogen inactivation or attenuation.
This has worked efficiently for Cholera, Typhoid, Polio, Measles,
Plague or Tetanus. Conjugate-vaccines and subunit vaccines have
also provided effective triumphs in vaccinology for pneumonia,
sepsis and meningitis4
. The pace of these vaccine developments is
comparatively slow to that imprinted by 21st-century vaccines that
use recombinant genetic technology. During the recent pandemic
of COVID-19, six vaccine candidates encoding or presenting SARS￾CoV-2 antigens have entered phase I clinical trials to assess their
safety and immunogenicity, including those based on mRNA
(NCT04283461), adenoviral vector 5 (NCT04313127); chimpanzee
adenoviral vector ChAdOx1 (NCT04324606), DNA (NCT04336410), a
lentiviral vector (NCT04276896) and artificial antigen-presenting cells
or aAPC (NCT04299724). Despite the fact that most of these COVID-19
vaccine candidates are being evaluated in phase I trials, some are
experimental (DNA/RNA vaccines) and may have a longer journey
ahead to achieve licensure. Available information indicates that
various candidates express the COVID-19 spike (S) glycoprotein to
neutralise the virus and prevent attachment to the human
angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, known to be
the co-receptor for viral entry of SARS-CoV-25
.
The mRNA1273-COVID-19 vaccine has set a record time by
reaching trials (NCT04283461) in only 69 days after the identifica￾tion of the SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of the current
outbreak6
. This is a nanoparticle encapsulated (LNP) mRNA
vaccine that encodes a full length, prefusion stabilised spike (S)
glycoprotein, which progressed directly to clinical assessment
without pre-clinical studies due to its potentially safe nature, thus
accounting for its speed in reaching phase I trials. A recombinant
novel COVID-19 vaccine based on an adenovirus vector 5 (Ad5-
nCoV) encoding the full-length S protein has progressed fastest
and has now entered phase II trials from 12th April 2020. The INO￾4800, DNA plasmid-based vaccine encodes the S protein and is
delivered by two intradermal injections followed by electropora￾tion of the DNA vaccine in healthy volunteers. The COVID-19
specific aAPC vaccine has been prepared by transfection of aAPCs
with a genetically-modified lentivirus encoding the SARS-CoV-2
structural and protease protein domains to aAPCs, which are
delivered by three subcutaneous injections to healthy and COVID￾19 positive volunteers between age of 6 months to 80 years. The
lentiviral-based COVID-19 (LV-DC) vaccine and antigen-specific
cytotoxic T cell (CTL) vaccine encoding COVID-19 antigens were
given via subcutaneous injection and intravenous (IV) infusion
respectively to the volunteers including the laboratory (RT-PCR)
confirmed COVID-19 infections as part of Phase I/II trial. In
addition, a COVID-19 vaccine based on Chimpanzee Adenovirus
Vector (ChAdOx1) developed by University of Oxford has entered
phase I/II clinical trial in April 2020 to test its safety, tolerability and
reactogenicity profile, as well as its immunogenicity in 510
volunteers. This vaccine also aims to be assessed for efficacy to
prevent infection measured by PCR as well as symptomatic
infection (NCT04324606). Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors are
replication-deficient vaccines that carry one or a few encoded
antigens and efficiently stimulate both arms of the adaptive
immune responses: humoral and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). They
have been very well-studied as a vaccine platform in over 10
different pathogens with safe profile in thousands of volunteers
from 1 week of age to 90 year-old volunteers7
.
In comparison, other Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV8 and
SARS-CoV9 have reached clinical trials within ~22 months and
~25 months, respectively after their outbreaks (NCT02670187,
NCT00099463). Both first clinical trials were based on DNA
vaccines encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein and even though
the results of the SARS-CoV vaccine have not been published yet,
MERS-CoV DNA vaccine preliminary results showed good toler￾ability and immunogenicity in humans, with immune responses
similar to the ones elicited after natural infection, which supports
further development.
This pace of development is striking when compared to new
emerging diseases causing major epidemics declared by the WHO
such as the arboviral diseases Dengue10, Chikungunya11,12 and
Zika13–15, which reached trials in 52, ~19 and ~9 years after
declaration of major outbreaks, respectively ((13), (17),

NCT02840487). Dengue Virus has been in circulation for more than
a century and a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine produced by
Sanofi Pasteur has only been authorized by the European
Medicine Agency in 2018. However, the very first clinical trial
was done during the World War II by Albert Sabin, who used a
Dengue virus originally attenuated in mice16. The first chikungu￾nya vaccine tested in humans in the late 60’s used a formalin￾inactivated virus17, which was subsequently abandoned for new
vaccine platforms such as a virus-like particle particle (VLP)
platform (NCT01489358), which has showed high titters of
neutralizing antibodies in recipients after a second dose18. The
first Zika DNA vaccine reached trials in August 2016, 9 years after
ZIKV outbreak in part of the Federated States of Micronesia, 3
years after the major epidemic in French Polynesia in October
2013 but just 6 months after WHO declaration as the Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 2016,
highlighting the advances in the modern vaccine development in
urgent need. A Zika DNA vaccine delivered in a split-dose needle
freeway, was able to induce six times higher immune responses
compared to a single-dose delivery via needle and syringe and
therefore moved into an international placebo-controlled phase 2
efficacy trial19.
Other emerging diseases that have caused major epidemics are
Haemorrhagic fever viral diseases such as Ebola20, Crimean-Congo
fever21 and Lassa fever22. These have taken more than three
decades to get to the first-in-human assessment (NCT00072605,
NCT03020771, NCT03805984) (Fig. 1) but unfortunately not all of
them have described safety and tolerability results yet. However,
the rVSV-Ebola vaccine candidate based on a live, attenuated
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector produced by Merck
has progressed beyond I/II/III clinical trials23,24 receiving approval
by the US FDA25 in December 2019; whereas a viral-vectored
Ebola vaccine candidate consisting of Ad26/MVA has now
completed phase III trial (NCT02543567). Initial vaccine clinical
trials may not always lead to a successful license but can pave the
way to the success of future vaccines in acquiring the license.
The great majority of licensed vaccines are based in inactiva￾tion/attenuation pathogens which lengthen the development,
cost and production of the vaccine. Recombinant viral vectored,
DNA/RNA and protein technologies are setting the fastest records
in vaccine development but just a selected few have been
licensed so far for veterinary use only, since, for humans some
vaccines have not met some regulatory requirements for approval
and commercialization yet but international emergencies like the
current COVID-19 could provide a final push towards obtaining
licensure. This highlights the potential of vaccinology to make fast
progress when appropriate international support exists, proving
that when there is a will, there is a way.
