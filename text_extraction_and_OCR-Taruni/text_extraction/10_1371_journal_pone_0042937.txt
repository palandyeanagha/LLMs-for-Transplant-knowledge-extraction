Abstract
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV and co-infection with 2 or 3 viruses and evaluate risk factors among
injecting drug users (IDUs) in Yunnan province, China.
Methods: 2080 IDUs were recruited from 5 regions of Yunnan Province, China to detect the infection status of HIV, hepatitis
B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors related to HIV, HCV and
HBV infections.
Results: The infection rates among all participants were 25.5% for HIV, 77.7% for HCV, 19.2% for HBV, 15% for HIV/HCV, 0.3%
for HIV/HBV, 7.8% for HCV/HBV and 7.1% for HIV/HCV/HBV. The prevalence of virus infection varied widely by region in
Yunnan of China. Statistical analyses indicated that high prevalence of HIV and HCV among IDUs was positively associated
with the duration of drug injection and sharing needles/syringes; besides, HCV infection was associated with the frequency
of drug injection.
Conclusions: HIV, HCV, HBV infections and co-infections were still very prevalent among IDUs in Yunnan province because
of drug use behaviors.

Introduction
Yunnan is one of the provinces hardest hit by HIV epidemic in
China, since the first large HIV outbreak occurred in 1989 among
injecting drug users (IDUs) in Dehong prefecture [1–4]. In
Yunnan, the cumulative number of HIV positives reported at the
end of October 2011 was 93, 567, including 25, 698 AIDS cases
and 14,340 recorded deaths. According to sentinel surveillance
data, HIV prevalence mainly concentrated on two high-risk
populations: IDUs and female sexual workers (FSWs). 53.2% HIV
positive cases were IDUs, and 18.6% were FSWs [5]. Although
HIV infection through heterosexual contact has increased steadily
from less than 5% in 1996 to up to 20% recently, intravenous drug
use is still the dominate transmission mode of HIV [4]. A long
history of opium/heroin trade and high prevalence of illicit drugs,
majority of which are trafficked from ‘‘golden triangle’’, have
partly accounted for the high prevalence of HIV infection in
Yunnan, especially among IDUs [6]. The data showed that HIV
in Yunnan has primarily spread through intravenous drug use with
a high annual incidence rate of 2.2%–8.0% [7], and the provincial
average prevalence among IDUs fluctuated between 21.2% and
27.8% through 2004 [3]. Moreover, the rate of HIV infection
among IDUs was reported as high as 74.5% [8]. However, HIV
prevalence varies from region to region in Yunnan Province.
Sentinel surveillance data in 2004 indicated that HIV prevalence
among IDUs was 60.4% in Kaiyuan city, 41% in Yingjiang
county, 21.5% in Qujing prefecture, 4.6% in Zhaotong prefecture
and 2.9% in Baoshan prefecture [9]. Furthermore, these ratios
reported recently still reveal uneven prevalence in different
regions. By the end of 2007, in several regions including Yingjiang
county and Kaiyuan city, HIV prevalence among IDUs was also
higher than 40% [8]. Another study demonstrated HIV preva￾lence among Kaiyuan’s IDUs was as high as 59.9% in 2007 [10].
From 1992 to 2009, 3591 IDUs were tested for HIV and the
average infection rate was 3.15% in Baoshan [11].

Besides HIV, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among IDUs is also alarming.
Previous studies conducted in 2007 showed 68.1% IDUs were
infected with HCV in Yunnan [12]. Another study estimated in
2009 the rate of HCV positive was 83.33% among Yunnan IDUs
[13]. Tian et al found the infection rate among Yunnan IDUs was
69.7% for HCV and 36.45% for HBV [14]. Meanwhile, HCV
and HBV infection among IDUs in Dehong was 35.3% and
52.9%, respectively [15]. Due to sharing the similar transmission
mode, co-infection with HIV and hepatitis viruses is quite frequent
amongst IDUs sharing needles/syringes with each other [16]. It
was indicated the rate of sharing injecting equipment was as high
as 59.4% among HIV-infected IDUs in Yunnan [9], and 93.3% to
99.3% of them were co-infected with HCV [12,17]. High
prevalence of co-infection with HCV (92%) or HBV (71%)
among HIV positive IDUs was also reported in Ruili county,
Yunnan province [18].
Previous studies have confirmed that HIV co-infection can
accelerate the clinical course of chronic HCV or HBV infection
and increase the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and decompensated liver disease [19,20]. Although the
effects of HCV or HBV on HIV are controversial, some studies
have shown HIV positive patients co-infected with HCV and/or
HBV have more rapid progression of AIDS and related death
compared with patients without co-infections [21]. Additionally,
co-infection with HCV and HBV is not uncommon among IDUs,
and patients with dual HCV and HBV infection have more severe
liver disease with increasing risk for progression to HCC [22].
Therefore, it is indispensable to investigate and ascertain the
prevalence of the co-infection of HIV and HCV and/or HBV, or
HCV and HBV to understand the true burden of disease among
IDUs.
HIV infection among IDUs has been well recognized in
Yunnan, China. However, limited data are available on the
prevalence of HCV, HBV and co-infection with HIV and HCV
and/or HBV, or HCV and HBV, especially in respective
prefecture. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted to
estimate the prevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV and co-infection with
2 or 3 viruses and evaluate risk factors among IDUs in Yunnan
province.
Methods
Study population
A cross-sectional study was conducted among IDUs recruited
from communities, free HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing
(VCT), needle and syringe programs (NSP), or Methadone
maintenance treatment programs (MMT) with the assistance of
local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 5
regions of Yunnan province between March 2009 and October
2011. Those who met the following criteria were selected as study
subjects: 1) being age $16 years, 2) had a history of injecting drug
use, 3) be able to provide informed consent. After written consent,
all eligible participants were interviewed privately and confiden￾tially with a pre-code, structured questionnaire, which was
developed after reviewing published literatures on risk factors for
HIV, HCV and HBV infection. It assessed demographic
characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity and marital status), risk
behaviors including the duration of drug injection, needles/
syringes sharing, the number of sexual partner and ever having a
history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). All variables can be
found in Table 1. Volunteers could end the interview at any time
or refuse to answer any question(s), and decline to donate blood
without any negative consequence. After completion of the
interview, subjects were asked to donate venous blood. However,
blood samples were abandoned to be collected from IDUs who
refuse to answer any question(s) in questionnaire. At last, a total of
2080 samples were collected and stored at 270uC until use
according to standard procedures.
Ethical clearance
Ethical approval for the study and the informed consent process
were approved by the Ethics Committee of Kunming Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research was
conducted in accordance with basic principles of the Helsinki
declaration and the relevant international rules.
Viral infection assays
Blood samples were used for testing HIV, HCV and HBV
status. HIV infection was identified using the fourth generation of
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing kit (ELISA, Wantai
Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and
confirmed by another ELISA kit (Shanghai Kehua Bio-engineer￾ing Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Specimens with positive results in
both ELISA assays were considered positive for HIV. ELISA kits
were used to test the presence of anti-HCV and HBsAg (Shanghai
Kehua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd., China) respectively.
HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV, HCV/HBV co-infection and HIV/
HCV/HBV triple infections were defined as previously [23],
namely positive HIV and HCV serology, positive HIV and HBV
serology, positive HCV and HBV serology, positive HIV, HCV
and HBV serology, respectively.
Data analysis
Data was inputted in excel and transferred into the R program
for data exploration and analysis. The demographic data of
participants were described in percentage and mean. Prevalence of
infections was calculated by regions. Significance of difference was
initially assessed with the chi-square (x2) test and Kruskal-Wallis
test. As potential confounding was considered among behaviors,
multivariate logistic regression analyses was used to identify
independent risk factors for infections. 95% confidence interval
(CI) and odd ratios (ORs) were calculated. P value ,0.05 was used
to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Description of the study population
A total of 2080 IDUs were recruited, with 570 were from
Zhaotong, 229 from Qujing, 329 from Kaiyuan city, Honghe
prefecture, 472 from Baoshan, 480 from Yingjiang county,
Dehong prefecture. The mean age of study cohorts was 31.7
years old. Male (93.3%) and Han ethnicity (75.0%) constituted the
majority, and 45.5% IDUs were unemployed and 43.8% were
single. These demographic characteristics varied dependent on
regions and the differences were significant (p,0.001, Table 1).
Drug use and sexual behaviors were also shown in the Table 1.
Totally, most IDUs (89.1%) were injecting only. The mean
duration of drug injection was 6.8 years ranging from 5.4 in
Zhaotong to 11.6 in Kaiyuan. More than half of them (55.6%)
injected drugs $3 time a day and 33.7% reported sharing
needles/syringes with others. 55.6% had more than 1 sexual
partner. Furthermore, 15.8% IDUs had the history of STD,
however, none of them reported having sex with a person of the
same sex (data not shown in Table 1). As demographic
characteristics, there were significant differences in risk behaviors
among IDUs from 5 study sites (p,0.001 or p,0.01).

Prevalence of HBV, HCV & HIV Co-Infection in IDUs
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e42937

Prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV infection
As our previous study [23], HCV (77.7%) is more prevalent
than HIV (25.5%) and HBV (19.2%) among all IDUs (Table 2,
Figure 1). HIV infection in Kaiyuan (66.3%) was the most
prevalent. The difference of HIV prevalence among 5 regions was
statistical significant (p,0.001). Like HIV, there was also
geographical distinction in HCV and HBV prevalence
(p,0.001). It was notable that Baoshan not only had the lowest
HIV infection but also HCV and HBV infection (70.3% and
7.4%, respectively). However, Kaiyuan had the highest ratio of
HCV (89.1%), while Yingjiang was the most prevalent region of
HBV (44.2%) among 5 study sites (Table 2).
Prevalence of HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV, HCV/HBV and HIV/HCV/
HBV co-infection
The prevalence of HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV, HCV/HBV and
HIV/HCV/HBV among IDUs was 15.5%, 0.3%, 7.8% and
7.1%, respectively (Table 2, Figure 1). The ratio of co-infection
with 2 or 3 viruses varied by regions (p,0.001 or p = 0.02). In
brief, the highest prevalence of HIV/HCV co-infection (37.1%)
and triple infections (18.5%) was both seen in Kaiyuan where no
one co-infected with HIV and HBV. Yingjiang showed the most
prevalent of HCV/HBV (15%). Qujing (0.9%) and Yingjiang
(0.8%) were only two regions existing HIV/HBV co-infection.
Risk behaviors associated with HIV, HCV and HBV
infection
In order to analyze the relationship between drug use and
sexual behaviors and viruses infection, we firstly did univariate
analysis. The results indicated that risk factors, such as long time of
drug injection ($5 years), frequent injecting drug and needles/
syringes sharing as well as STD, were significantly associated with
HIV and HCV infection (p,0.001 or p = 0.003), but we didn’t
find any drug use and sexual behaviors in our study might be risk
factors of HBV infection (Table 3). Besides, it was shown high ratio
of injecting during drug usage was easily infected with HCV
(p,0.001, Table 3). Secondly, we performed multivariate analyses
to further make sure risk factors. As a result, we obtained almost
consistent results, except that frequent injecting drug and STD

were no more the risk factors associated with HIV, and STD was
not associated with HCV infection (Table 4). In brief, both
univariate analysis and multivariate analysis indicated that long
time of drug injection ($5 years) and needles/syringes sharing
were associated with HIV and HCV infection, and frequent
injecting drug (.1 time/d) was also associated with HCV infection
besides.
Discussion
HIV infection among IDUs has been well recognized in
Yunnan province, China [1–8]. However, there are limited data
on the prevalence of HCV, HBV and co-infection with HIV and
HCV and/or HBV, or HCV and HBV among IDUs, especially
among them from respective prefecture in Yunnan. It is well
known that designing an effective management to control the
prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV among IDUs is a great
challenge for health authorities. Therefore, grasping the true
burden of disease and associated risk factors among IDUs seem to
be the top priority recently. Our study represented the first large
investigation to study the HIV, HCV, HBV and co-infection
epidemic and assess related risk factors among IDUs in Yunnan
province. The results showed high prevalence of HIV (25.5%),
HCV (77.7%), HBV (19.2%) and uncommon co-infection of
HIV/HCV (15.5%), HIV/HBV (0.3%), HCV/HBV (7.8%),
HIV/HCV/HBV (7.1%) among IDUs.
It was obvious that HIV prevalence among IDUs was
remarkably high, almost two times higher than national infectious
level (12.55%) [24]. IDUs are always one of the most effected
groups in Yunnan since the first large HIV outbreak occurred
among them in 1989. Initially, HIV infection rate among IDUs
had been up to 100%, while the digit reduced to 40% in 2006,
28.7% in 2007, and then remained near that level [7,8]. However,
the severity of HIV prevalence in different regions was still
different. By the end of 2004, the survey data from sentinel sites
throughout the province indicated that HIV prevalence among
IDUs from 5 prefectures including Dehong, Chuxiong, Lincang,
Honghe and Wenshan had surpassed 40%. Compared with them,
other prefectures such as Qujing (21.5%) Zhaotong (4.6%) and
Baoshan (2.9%) had relative lower prevalence [9]. Furthermore, a
prior study conducted in 2007 in Kaiyuan city also demonstrated
HIV prevalence among IDUs was as high as 59.9% [22]. Another
study also revealed the high prevalence of HIV among IDUs in
Dehong. It was estimated that there were at least 15000 IDUs and
45.4% were infected with HIV in 2004, 38.4% in 2008 [25,26].
Our data showed this different severity consistently. Dehong
prefecture and Honghe prefecture are in the proximity to the
border with Myanmar and Vietnam, respectively. It’s well known
cross-border travel and commerce including illicit drug trade are
very common, which may be responsible for the high prevalence
among IDUs in these prefectures.
Interestingly, although Baoshan locates near to Yingjiang,
Dehong prefecture, it has relative lower HIV infection rate among
IDUs (4.2%) compared with that in the latter (35.8%). One reason
for the substantial regional heterogeneity in HIV prevalence may
be the difference in drug use behaviors between two regions. Our
study found HIV infection was strongly associated with needles/
syringes sharing, and the ratio of neddles/syringes sharing among
Yingjiang’s IDUs (37.1%) was significant higher than among
baoshan’s IDU, which may be the reason of low HIV epidemic in
Baoshan. It seems to be the first time to interpret uneven
prevalence of HIV among IDUs between Baoshan and Yingjiang.
In addition, we estimated that Zhaotong prefecture has a great

Prevalence of HBV, HCV & HIV Co-Infection in IDUs
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e42937

potential for HIV spread among its IDUs since high prevalence of
risk factors like needle sharing (41.3%) [27].
On the other hand, it is worthy to note that there is a high
prevalence rate of HCV among overall IDUs (77.7%), and even in
IDUs from Baoshan (70.3%) and Zhaotong (82.1%), where HIV
infection among them is relative low (Table 2, Figure 1). Previous
studies have demonstrated that the prevalence rate of HCV is up
to 10 times higher than that of HIV, and HCV prevalence could
be an indicator of HIV risk among IDUs [28,29]. Our results
showed that there is a high prevalence of HCV infection but low
HIV prevalence both in Zhaotong and Baoshan. Therefore, we
estimated that either HIV prevalence might have been effectively
controlled or a looming HIV epidemic may be appearing among
IDUs in these two regions. As is well known, China is a high
prevalence area of HBV with a general seroprevalence of 5.84%
[30]. Much high HBV prevalence was identified among IDUs
(19.2%) in this study. This may imply more effective strategies are
needed to control HCV and HBV infections among IDUs.
Long duration of injecting and needle sharing are believed to be
the major risk factors for HIV and HCV infections among IDUs
[25,31–33]. Our research confirmed their results. Furthermore,
among our study population, 57.1% IDUs had injected drugs for
$5 years, 33.7% had shared needles and 55.6% had reported
injecting drugs $3 times a day. In addition, we also found IDUs
who were old, minority ethnicity, farmers or had primary
education were more likely to infect HIV. The factors significantly
associated with HCV were older age, unemployed. For HBV, the
factors were older age, minority ethnicity and farmer, while higher
education was found to be a protective factor (data not shown).
However, our study failed to establish association between HBV
and drug use or sexual behaviors. This could be partly explained
by the immunity to HBV before injecting or heterosexual contact
was initiated. It was reported that HBV vaccine had been initiated
from 1985 in China, and the immunization coverage of it among
children aged from 1 to 3 years was 70.34% in Yunnan [34], while
significant difference of the coverage was also found in different
regions with higher rate in urban and lower rate in rural areas,
which may be the evidence for the higher prevalence of HBV
among farmers in our study. These findings suggest that
prevention and intervention should be paid more attention to
IDUs who were older, minority ethnicity, farmer/unemployed to
control high risk behaviors. On the other hand, the first pilot of
NSP was launched in Yunnan province in 1999 [24]. It is
estimated NSP has averted approximately 16–20% of the potential
HIV cases since 2002 [6]. Despite of the large investment and
positive achievement in NSP, less than 25% IDUs obtain their
injecting equipment through NSP and 45% remains sharing
injecting equipment [6]. Hence, there is much more room for NSP
to control high risk drug use behaviors among IDUs.
There is a primary limit in our study. Drug use and sexual
behaviors of our subjects are self-reported. This may result in
missing values and untruthful responses. Because drug use is illegal
in our country and discriminated in the society, drug users are
likely to hide their activities even though we ensured that there was
no threat of prosecution. This may be the reason why we did not
get the information of frequency of injecting drugs and whether
sharing needle or sexual behavior information among Kaiyuan
IDUs. Therefore, we used the data of risk behaviors in other four
sites except that in Kaiyuan to assess the association between them
with HIV, HCV and HBV infection. Nevertheless, our results are
consistent with previous studies. We believe our study have great
implication in future efforts on the transmission of HIV, HCV and

Prevalence of HBV, HCV & HIV Co-Infection in IDUs
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e42937

HBV among IDUs and from them to general population in
Yunnan province.
In conclusion, high prevalence of HIV as well as HCV, HBV
infections and co-infections was still found among IDUs in
Yunnan accompanying with high risk behaviors. These findings
underscore the urgent need to improve harm-reduction interven￾tions such as NSP and more effective treatments including
launching more education among IDUs who were old, farmers/
unemployed and minority ethnicity to control HIV, HCV and
HBV infection and transmission among IDUs, especially among
them from Zhaotong and Baoshan, where HIV prevalence has the
potential growth. Much more attention should also be paid to the
high prevalence of co-infections including HIV/HCV, HCV/
HBV, HIV/HCV/HBV among IDUs.
