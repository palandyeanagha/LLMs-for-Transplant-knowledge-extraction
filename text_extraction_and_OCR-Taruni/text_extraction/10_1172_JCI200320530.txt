For one hundred and forty-five years, biologists have
known that cells come from cells (1). This concept is
so fundamental today that we accept it implicitly; cells
either divide asymmetrically to preserve stem cell pro￾genitors, partition into sister cells, differentiate along
fate pathways, or undergo oncogenesis following the
formation of normal tissues. Specification and diver￾sification of cell lineages are initiated by genetic pro￾grams under the control of morphogenic cues (2–4).
These lineages evolve in a hierarchical manner con￾forming to developmental boundaries and oscillating
biological clocks until reaching terminal differentia￾tion (5). Epithelia from metazoans are emblematic of
this process, and at maturity cover outer surfaces (6, 7)
or line hollow cavities formed by tubular structures in
complex tissues (8–10). Since epithelia typically serve
specialized functions (11–13), it is assumed that a state
of terminal differentiation is necessary and protected
once development is complete.
In recent years, however, this formidable notion has
been challenged by observations that mature epithelia
change their phenotype following morphogenic pres￾sure from injured tissue. Since the phenomenon of
epithelial plasticity was described before it had a firm
biochemical basis (14, 15), one is confronted with a
plethora of seemingly interchangeable vocabulary.
Today, the terms “epithelial-mesenchymal transforma￾tion, interactions, or transition” are comingled inap￾propriately with the term “epithelial-mesenchymal
transdifferentiation.” “Transformation” classically
describes the oncogenic conversion of epithelia. Like￾wise, the induction of bone marrow stem cells to form
somatic cells probably should be considered differenti￾ation rather than transdifferentiation (16). Epithelial￾mesenchymal interaction refers to proximate paracrine
cross-talk between tissue epithelia and stromal fibro￾blasts and is completely different from the concept of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a
variant of transdifferentiation and a well-recognized
mechanism for dispersing cells in vertebrate embryos
(17), forming fibroblasts in injured tissues (18, 19), or
initiating metastases in epithelial cancer (20–23). We
prefer the term “transition” to describe this conversion
instead of “epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentia￾tion” because “transdifferentiation” classically refers to
differentiated cells changing into other differentiated
cells (24). Transdifferentiation has been observed in
retinal pigmented cells that become lens epithelia (25,
26), in the conversion from white to brown adipocytes
(27), endothelial cells that become vascular smooth
muscle cells (28), lactotrophs that interconvert to
somatotrophs in the pituitary (29), pancreatic acinar
cells that become ductal epithelium (30, 31) or hepato￾cytes (32, 33), and hepatocytes that morph into pan￾creatic ductal cells (34). Although many investigators
fail to make the distinction between transdifferentia￾tion and transition, it may be time to do so. It is not yet
clear whether the fibroblast transition of EMT is an
expected middle phase of transdifferentiating epitheli￾um or whether EMT producing fibroblasts is an arrested

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central mechanism for diversifying the cells found in
complex tissues. This dynamic process helps organize the formation of the body plan, and while EMT is
well studied in the context of embryonic development, it also plays a role in the genesis of fibroblasts dur￾ing organ fibrosis in adult tissues. Emerging evidence from studies of renal fibrosis suggests that more
than a third of all disease-related fibroblasts originate from tubular epithelia at the site of injury. This
review highlights recent advances in the process of EMT signaling in health and disease and how it may
be attenuated or reversed by selective cytokines and growth factors.

form of transdifferentiation (24). EMT of terminally
differentiated epithelium, in its purest sense, produces
a tissue fibroblast (19).
Developmental biologists have also known for
decades that epiblasts undergo EMT to form primary
mesenchyme in the creation of tripoblastic germ layers
(17, 35–37; Figure 1). In the mesoderm this is followed
by mesenchymal-epithelial transitions to create sec￾ondary epithelium as part of somitogenesis (38, 39)
and the further commitment and diversification of
cells forming mesoendodermal structures (40–42). Sec￾ondary epithelium in mature or adult tissues can also
undergo EMT following epithelial stress, such as
inflammation (18, 19) or wounding (17, 43) that leads
to fibroblast production and fibrogenesis. Epithelia
forming tumors also use EMT when carcinomas
become metastatic (23, 44, 45).
We review here recent observations regarding the
mechanism of EMT in culture and during fibrogenesis,
especially associated with kidney disease. The problem
of tissue fibrosis is that epithelial units are overtaken
by scarification and lose their morphogenic cues, leav￾ing involved organs to fail. While traditional studies of
fibrosis have focused on the production of extracellu￾lar matrix, recent information now suggests that
epithelia contribute to the problem by creating new
fibroblasts. Experiments demonstrating the reversibil￾ity of organ fibrosis also highlight the need to consid￾er cellular mechanisms of fibrogenesis and the basic
biology that will, one hopes, contribute new molecules
as useful therapeutics.
The mechanism of EMT
From a general perspective, EMT is about disaggregat￾ing epithelial units and reshaping epithelia for move￾ment. Epithelium in transition lose polarity, adherens
junctions, tight junctions, desmosomes, and cytoker￾atin intermediate filaments in order to rearrange their
F-actin stress fibers and express filopodia and lamel￾lopodia. This phenotypic conversion requires the molec￾ular reprogramming of epithelium with new biochem￾ical instructions. Much of this conversion has been
studied fractionally, during experiments that expose
new transduction and signaling pathways, in epithelia
that transition in culture, and more recently in fibro￾genic tissues. Below we describe an enlarging picture of
EMT from a broad and increasingly complex literature.
Induction of EMT. EMT is easily engaged by a combi￾nation of cytokines associated with proteolytic diges￾tion of basement membranes upon which epithelia
reside. Metalloproteinases (46, 47) or membrane assem￾bly inhibitors (48) initiate the process by dismantling
the local basement membrane. Local expression of
TGF-β, EGF, IGF-II, or FGF-2 facilitates EMT (Figure
2) by binding epithelial receptors with ligand-inducible
intrinsic kinase activity (49–52). The TGF-β effect
depends on β-integrin transduction (53), Smad3-
dependent transcription (54), or Smad-independent
p38MAP kinase activation and GTPase-mediated sig￾naling (53, 55, 56). Depending on the tissue, all three
isoforms of TGF-β may be involved sequentially (57–59).
While TGF-β is considered prototypical in its induction
of EMT (50, 60, 61), there is an increase in epithelial EGF
receptors in the EMT microenvironment (62), and EGF
can assist in completing the conversion (50). IGF-II also
directs the redistribution of β-catenins from the cell sur￾face to the nucleus and facilitates the intracellular
degradation of E-cadherin (51), while FGF-2 and TGF-β
are required for the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9
to assist in basement membrane degradation (52).
Figure 1
Primitive epithelia (epiblasts) form tropoblastic germ layers through EMT. The primary mesenchyme that migrates after EMT is reinduced
to secondary epithelium by mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Secondary epithelia differentiate to form new epithelial tissues and under￾go a second round of EMT to form the cells of connective tissue, including astrocytes, adipocytes chondrocytes, osteoblasts, muscle cells,
and fibroblasts. Mature secondary epithelia that form epithelial organs can also transform into primary tumors that later undergo EMT
to metastasize. These processes are regulated by morphogenic cues and a variety of transcription factors, and are potentially plastic in
their adaptation to new biologic circumstances.

Combinations of cytokines are generally present in
most areas of tissue injury, so it is difficult to assign pri￾orities or hierarchy. Each moiety may contribute a
unique inducement to the transition. Furthermore, the
role of HGF and FGFs depends on the timed expression
and selective distribution of receptors (63, 64). While
HGF action through its c-Met/Crk adaptor proteins
(65) induces EMT during somitogenesis and endocar￾dial cushion development (66, 67) and modulates the
connectivity of intercellular junctions between polar￾ized intestinal and kidney epithelium (68), in the fibro￾genic kidney it has the opposite effect of protecting
epithelium from EMT (69). In this regard, the expres￾sion of bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7) also coun￾terbalances EMT in the kidney (54). Like many biologi￾cal systems, countervening processes that modulate
EMT effector events are beginning to appear.
Engagement of protein kinases. Epithelial signaling that
leads to EMT has been studied in a variety of cultured
epithelia and seems to have broad generality across
numerous phenotypes (Figure 2). As a result of ligand￾inducible receptor kinase activation (14), there is a
downstream engagement of GTPases from the Ras
superfamily (70, 71) or commitment of SH2-SH3 pro￾tein domains of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (c-Src
and Btk) pathways (14, 72) that shift the intracellular
balance of small GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42).
Raf/MAP kinases are subsequently activated with sev￾eral interconnected consequences: engagement of the
EMT transcriptome (73) followed by actin rearrange￾ment of the cytoskeleton (70, 74). Integrin-linked
kinase (ILK) activation by TGF-β–activated Smad pro￾teins (75) or integrin signaling (76) enhances β-ca￾tenin/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) expression, sup￾pressing E-cadherin. Activation of Src kinases favors
the PI3K pathway, stabilization of β-catenin for
nuclear import (77), protection from apoptosis, and
disruption of β-integrin binding and E-cadherin com￾plexes (21, 53, 78, 79). Many of these pathways collab￾oratively reinforce EMT.
The nuclear import of LEF proteins with Smad3 or
β-catenin from the cytoplasm is beginning to look like
one of several key molecular steps in EMT (73, 80). The
phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase
kinase- (GSK-3β) allows it to form a complex with APC
suppressor protein and Axin (81). p53 activation of
APC-dependent pathways also forms a complex with
β-catenin (82), and both of these pathways lead to
direct loss of free β-catenin through ubiquination (83).
If, however, phosphorylation by GSK-3β is inhibited
(77), cytoplasmic β-catenin is stabilized by re-entering
the E-cadherin complex (84) or binding to the B-box of
LEF where together they move into the nucleus to
engage the EMT transcriptome (85). Wnt-1 (81), IGF-II
(51), Ras (77), and ILK (76) all stabilize cytoplasmic lev￾els of β-catenin to facilitate EMT, perhaps by GSK-3β
(or other kinase) inhibition. Smad3 activation by TGF-β
family members can also activate LEF-1 in the absence
of β-catenin (80). These latter findings suggest either a
synergistic or independent control of LEF-1 by at least
two EMT-linked signaling pathways. While levels of
APC suppressor protein in epithelia may protect the
state of terminal differentiation from EMT (73, 86),
activation of Smad pathways may provide a counter￾vailing leak in this stability. β-catenin and Smad3 also
require the engagement of different transcriptional
coactivators, depending on the promoter. These differ￾ences may regulate the selectivity or availability of the
EMT transcriptome.
Recently, there also has been some attempt to distin￾guish true EMT from an epithelial phenocopy called
“reversible scatter” (21, 73). Reversible scatter following
cytokine stimulation looks like EMT because the cells
assume a spindlelike shape and undergo a brief period
of transcription. But because transcription is not sus￾tained on withdrawal of the inducement and/or if the
cells are protected from apoptosis, the epithelia return
to their original state (21). TGF-β and Ras classically
produce EMT, while EGF, HGF, and FGF favor scatter￾ing (21), but not in all cells (52, 68). A scatter effect may
be facilitated by varying levels of cytoplasmic APC sup￾pressor protein (73) or preferred activation of the PI3K
pathway (21). Whether scatter reverses or goes on to
EMT may really just be a timing issue in the continu￾um of transition, as it is not clear what biological func￾tion reversible scatter serves on its own.
The EMT proteome. The EMT proteome reflects a fun￾damental change in proteins gained, maintained, or
lost (Table 1) with the conversion of epiblasts to pri￾mary mesenchyme (37, 87), secondary epithelium to
fibroblasts (88), or in the transition of tumor epithelia
to metastatic cells (89). Many studies have generally
focused on only one or two event markers (for example,
the changes in E-cadherin or Snail expression) and are

not comprehensive. Most information about the EMT
proteome is inferred from proteins found in epithelia
but not in fibroblasts or metastatic cancer cells, or is
based on apparent targets of transcription factors (15,
73). Although dependent on cell context and ease of
growth factor signaling, delamination of epithelia to
facilitate movement is also accompanied by a regulato￾ry decrease in apoptosis and mitosis (15, 21).
Cellular plasticity likely requires real-time control by
transcriptional networks (90–94). Some models suggest
several transcription factors may be key modulators of
transitional events. The Snail superfamily of zinc-finger
proteins has two evolutionary branches, one for Scratch
and the other for Snail and Slug (15). These proteins
recognize an E-box binding motif on the promoter for
E-cadherin (among others) in competition with the
basic helix-loop-helix protein SIP1. Ras/MAPK activates
Snail while TGF-β regulates Smad-dependent pathways
to engage SIP1 and Snail (15, 95). Subsequently E-cad￾herin, cytokeratin, muc-1, and desmoplakin are
repressed, while fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1),
fibronectin, vimentin, and Rho are increased (15, 54).
Repression of E-cadherin by Snail proteins frees up
more cytoplasmic β-catenin, which, as mentioned
above, is co-imported with LEF to the nucleus where its
activation is strongly associated with EMT (73). Ets
transcription factors regulate EMT in the heart (96, 97).
One of the more interesting proteins found in the
EMT proteome is FSP1 (18), also known as S100A4 (98).
Support for the notion that EMT is a major source of
fibroblasts comes from experiments showing FSP1
expression in cultured epithelium during EMT follow￾ing exposure to TGF-β and EGF (50), histologic evi￾dence that epithelial units expressing FSP1 disaggregate
as organ tissues devolve during the early stages of fibro￾genesis (18), and direct observations of EMT in trans￾genic mice carrying marked epithelium (19). Dividing
fibroblasts exposed to nucleoside analogues are also
selectively eliminated in transgenic mice expressing
thymidine kinase under control of the FSP1 promoter
(99). Members of the S100 superfamily have been impli￾cated in cytoskeletal-membrane interactions, calcium
signal transduction, and cellular growth and differenti￾ation (100). In the presence of calcium, FSP1 dimerizes
and binds the c-terminal of p53 in the cytoplasm. In this
way, FSP1 may sequester p53 from the APC ubiquina￾tion pathway (101, 102), perhaps raising levels of free
β-catenin. We suspect that FSP1 facilitates and may
even maintain the EMT phenotype through this mech￾anism (Figure 2). While the precise function of FSP1 is
not entirely clear, its interaction with cytoskeletal moi￾eties and its early role in EMT suggest that FSP1 may
fashion mesenchymal cell shape to enable motility (50)
and induce angiogenesis (103). The expression of FSP1
indicates the potential presence of a molecular program
determining fibroblast phenotype.
The promoter for FSP1 is also part of a transcriptome
that shares putative FTS-1/CArG box sites in the early
Figure 2 
Epithelial plasticity can lead to classical EMT (loss of cell-cell and cell-substratum attachments, new actin rearrangements, and gain of mobili￾ty) or reversible scatter, which looks like EMT but is not enduring and can revert. These events are regulated by ligand-inducible intrinsic kinase
receptors on the cell surface, which modulate small GTPases, Smads, PI3Ks, MAP kinases, and the availability of β-catenin to coactivate LEF in
the nucleus. Free levels of b-catenin are regulated by E-cadherin or APC/β-catenin/Axin complexes, the latter of which shuttle b-catenin between
ubiquination or utilization in adherens junctions. Activation of nuclear transcription provides new transcriptional regulators (Snail, SIP1, Ets,
and FTS-BP/CarG box binding factor) of the EMT proteome. The EMT proteome comprises proteins listed in Table 1. The variability of recep￾tors, kinases, and the emergence of combined preferences for signaling pathways determine the plasticity unique to each epithelium.

promoter regions of a group of genes that would be
expected in EMT-derived fibroblasts, including those
encoding c-myc, c-Fos, H-ras, Slap, TGF-β, FGF-1, -2,
and -8, FSP1, vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin
(αSMA), aggrecan, collagen types I and III, throm￾bospondin I, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9
(19). One hypothesis is that the selective engagement
of FTS-1/CArG box sites by a transcriptional complex
of proteins may be one of several key regulators of
EMT; preliminary evidence suggests a new Kruppel-like
zinc finger protein called FTS/CArG box binding fac￾tor (FTS-BP/CBF) (refs. 104, 105; and our unpublished
observations) may contribute.
GTPase modulation of cell shape and movement. Epithelia
that undergo EMT during development, inflammation,
or carcinogenesis become mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts,
or metastatic tumor cells, respectively (19, 72, 106). This
conversion of epithelia is dependent on molecular switch￾es under the control of the Ras superfamily of small
GTPases (71). Ras and Rho families of GTPases are acti￾vated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (107) and
deactivated by GTPase activating proteins (108). GTPas￾es are a signaling link between cell surface receptor acti￾vation and the actin cytoskeleton; some GTPases can also
cooperatively modulate EMT with cytokine pressure (21,
109). Three of the best-studied small GTPases are Rho,
Rac, and Cdc42. The cross-talk between these members
suggests they are activated independently or in series: Ras
or Cdc42 can activate Rac, and Rac can inhibit or activate
Rho (110–113). Rho helps reconfigure actin stress fibers
and stimulates actin-myosin contraction in the cell body,
Rac induces the assembly of actin surface protrusions
called lamellopodia, and Cdc42 promotes the formation
of actin-rich finger extensions called filopodia and mod￾ulates cellular asymmetry (71). Their differential activa￾tion and balance ensure not only epithelialization but
also its dissolution. The cellular properties of contrac￾tion, migration, proliferation, and phagocytosis are also
under GTPase control (70). The cellular actions of these
small GTPases engage downstream MAP kinases, alter
gene transcription, and are integral to shaping cell phe￾notype during EMT.
Fibroblasts derive from a niche
Since the original observations of Cohnheim (114),
investigators have debated the origin of tissue fibrob￾lasts. Three notions persist regarding their lineage: The
longest-held concept is that fibroblasts are simply resid￾ual embryonic mesenchymal cells left over from organo￾genesis. While this hypothesis explains the incorrect but
often interchangeable substitution of the term “fibrob￾last” for “mesenchymal cell,” the idea itself has no proof
and is unlikely since primary mesenchymal cells do not
express FSP1 (18). A second notion argues that fibrob￾lasts emerge from the bloodstream after release from the
bone marrow (115), and a third view suggests that
fibroblasts derive locally in tissues following EMT (19).
The second and third hypotheses are mechanistically
identical; that is, all fibroblasts probably arise from EMT.
Interstitial fibroblasts appear after gastrulation (after
E8.5 in mice) (18) and form as a result of EMT from sec￾ondary epithelium (19). Support for the notion that
EMT is a major source of local fibroblasts comes from
experiments described above. FSP1 is also expressed in
some endosteal lining cells and marrow stromal cells
(19), and about 14–15% of fibroblasts in fibrosing kid￾ney are derived from marrow. Not much is known about
the origin of endosteal lining cells (116, 117). Endosteal
bone marrow lining cells precede the formation of the
marrow cavity and its contents (117), and in some
species are separated from medullary hematopoiesis by
a marrow sac comprising a mixture of simple epithelium
and/or condensed stromal-like cells (118, 119). This sac
appears to have a structural and biochemical interface
with endosteal lining cells in nodal regions of bone (118,
120), and the collective structure may be an EMT niche
for osteogenic precursor cells, indifferent endosteum,
fibroblasts, and marrow stromal cells. Recent evidence
also suggests it can be a niche for hematopoietic stem
cells (121). FSP1+ cells in the marrow are mostly CD34–.
CD34– progenitor cells cycle their expression of CD34 in
the marrow (122–124); both CD34– and CD34+ stromal
cells circulate in peripheral blood, and, following bone
marrow reconstitution, CD34 cells locate as bone-lining
endosteum (116, 124). Since some marrow stromal cells
can be released into the circulation (124), CD34–, FSP1+
bone marrow “fibroblasts” might derive from an
endosteal EMT niche transitioning to marrow stromal
cells (19), which then may evolve into circulating fibro￾cytes (115). The contribution of CD34–, Strol+, CD73+
mesenchymal stem cells in the accumulation of fibrob￾lasts in this setting is yet unknown.
Most investigators accept with conventional wisdom
that fibroblasts represent a cell type of limited diversity.
Fibroblast shape, cytoskeletal structure, secretion of
interstitial collagens, mobility, participation in tissue
fibrosis, and behavior in culture all tend to support this
belief. The EMT hypothesis, however, challenges this
notion of homogeneity, as do observations that fibrob￾lasts express subtle biochemical differences (125) and
phenotypic variability (126–128), and respond differ￾ently to cytokines and matrix (129), depending on their
tissue of origin. Recent evaluation of the transcriptome
from a variety of fibroblasts suggests there is topo￾graphic differentiation perhaps based on a “Hox code”
(130). Consequently, fibroblasts formed by EMT may
differentially express a profile of genes, or a few residual
receptors or signaling pathways representative of their
previous life as mature epithelium, and, theoretically,
can be as heterogeneous as the universe of epithelia.
EMT and fibrosis
The role of EMT during tissue injury leading to organ
fibrosis (deposition of collagens, elastin, tenacin, and
other matrix molecules) is becoming increasingly clear
(Figure 3). A great bulk of such evidence exists for EMT
associated with progressive kidney diseases (19), and
is probably true for the lung (131) and possibly the liver.

The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2003 | Volume 112 | Number 12 1781
Typical experimental models of kidney fibrosis in mice
or rats include progressive glomerulonephritis from
anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (132),
Alport syndrome (133), or spontaneous lupus nephritis
(134), and NOD or db/db nephritic mice (models for
diabetic nephropathy) (135), all of which chronically
progress at a slow pace, and unilateral ureteral obstruc￾tion (136), which progresses to end-stage quickly but
leaves the contralateral kidney normal as a control. A
number of studies demonstrating EMT during kidney
fibrosis correlate with the expression of FSP1 (described
above) (18, 50). FSP1 identifies tubular epithelial cells
undergoing transition in damaged nephrons trapped by
interstitial injury and tracks with increasing numbers
of fibroblasts as fibrosis grows worse (50, 137). These
FSP1+ epithelia traverse through damaged tubular base￾ment membrane (TBM) and accumulate in the intersti￾tium of the kidney (138) where they lose their epithelial
markers as they gain a fibroblast phenotype (50, 137).
Fibroblasts are not particularly abundant in normal
kidneys as they are in lungs, lymphoid nodes, and
spleens. When renal fibrogenesis sets in, about 36% of
new fibroblasts come from local EMT, about 14–15%
from the bone marrow, and the rest from local prolifer￾ation (19). This finding reinforces the notion that fibro￾genesis is a local epithelial event.
It is worth mentioning that fibroblasts have little in
the way of other distinguishing anatomic features, and
most of the proteins they express are not highly specif￾ic (18). Vimentin is not fibroblast-specific (50, 137),
and type I collagen synthesis is generally only
detectable in selected subpopulations of fibroblasts
(139–142). Some subpopulations of fibroblasts during
fibrogenesis express αSMA (46, 128, 143, 144), a mark￾er of activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) (145, 146).
While much of the fibrosis literature has relied on this
less specific marker, αSMA is not expressed by all
fibroblasts (137), suggesting that it does not define the
universe of fibroblasts and potentially also identifies
smooth muscle cells separated from local blood vessels
during tissue injury (137, 147). The increased number
of αSMA+ smooth muscle cells in fibrotic tissue may
derive from delaminated endothelial cells following
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (28).
Why are tubular epithelia susceptible to EMT? Injury
to the kidney is associated with many inflammatory
cells which can incite EMT using growth factors such as
TGF-β, EGF, and FGF-2 (52). Under the influence of
such growth factors, resident fibroblasts and tubular
epithelia induce basement membrane–degrading
enzymes such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 (48). Degradation
of TBM results in disruption of tubular nephrons, and
delaminated epithelial cells either fall off into the tubu￾lar fluid or migrate towards the interstitium under the
influence of increasing growth factor gradients and
chemoattractants (47). This initial recruitment of tubu￾lar epithelial cells for EMT can be inhibited by blocking
the expression of MMP-9 through the disruption of tis￾sue plasminogen activator (tPA, an activator of MMP-9)
(148). Other studies have also demonstrated that HGF
can decrease levels of TGF-β, restore TGF-β–mediated
loss of E-cadherin, and potentially decrease amounts of
active MMP-9 (149). In this regard, ILK is now identified
as a key mediator of TGF-β–induced EMT associated
with tubular epithelial cells (75).
The relevance of TGF-β–induced EMT for progres￾sion of kidney fibrosis was recently addressed in stud￾ies using BMP-7 as an intracellular competitor of TGF-β
signaling (54, 150, 151). BMP-7 is the endogenous
antagonist of TGF-β–induced EMT in the kidney and
elsewhere (54, 150, 151). BMP-7 reverses the decrease of
E-cadherin caused by TGF-β (54). Restoration of E-cad￾herin by BMP-7 is mediated by its ALK3/6 receptors
and Smad5. The capacity of BMP-7 to reverse TGF-β–
induced EMT in culture is also observed in mouse
models of kidney fibrosis. Systemic administration of
recombinant BMP-7 in mice with kidney fibrosis fol￾lowing ureteral obstruction results in reversal of EMT

damaged kidney tubules (yellow arrow), and blood vessels (green

few fibroblasts. (c) Schematic illustration of three possible mech￾anisms via which fibroblasts can originate during kidney injury.
Recent experiments suggest that approximately 14–15% of fibrob￾lasts are from bone marrow, 36% can arise via local EMT involving
tubular epithelial cells under inflammatory stress, and the rest are
likely contributed by proliferation of fibroblasts from all sources.
(d) Systemic treatment of mice with renal fibrosis using recombi￾nant human BMP-7 results in reversal of renal disease due to severe
decrease in EMT-derived fibroblasts and potentially bone mar￾row–derived fibroblasts. Such events likely have a cascade of ben￾eficial effects that decreasing the overall number of fibroblasts in

and repair of damaged tubular structures with repop￾ulation of healthy tubular epithelial cells (54, 152). This
reversal is also associated with return of renal function,
a significant decrease in FSP1+ interstitial fibroblasts
and de novo activation of BMP-7 signaling (54). Renal
protection from BMP-7 has also been observed in
murine models of diabetic nephropathy (153), Alport
syndrome, and lupus nephritis (150). Today, TGF-β sig￾naling attenuated by BMP-7 is the closest paradigm in
EMT arguing in favor of privileged pathways.
Summary
Progress in understanding EMT has been an exercise in
coming to appreciate the level of complexity required
for changing cellular identity. The mechanism of tran￾sition highlights an integration of nuclear regulation
and network signaling with alterations in microenvi￾ronment to create a moving cell. Remarkably, differen￾tiating epithelia make these transitions during devel￾opment, and terminally differentiated epithelia use
them for physiologic repair or to advance oncogenesis.
EMT is a form of molecular exaptation, a mechanism
of economy by which cells reuse known physiologic
processes to provide new functions (154). With the
foundation established by current studies, new ques￾tions regarding the definition and role of pericytes and
myofibroblasts can be explored, and a framework for a
better understanding of other transitions, like endothe￾lial-mesenchymal transition, is possible. EMT also pro￾vides a mechanism for creating ancestral relationships
between local cells and may be particularly important
in tumor expansion. Lastly, fibroblasts may carry for￾ward remnants of a unique epithelial signature. And if
all fibroblasts or tumor cells which arise via EMT are
not created equal, then therapies to combat fibrosis or
metastatic disease may need more specificity. Never￾theless, the future holds great promise for EMT as a
viable therapeutic target.
