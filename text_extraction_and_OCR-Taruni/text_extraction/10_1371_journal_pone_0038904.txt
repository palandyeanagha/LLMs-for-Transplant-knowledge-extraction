Abstract
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Asia. In this study, based on a large cohort
of Chinese patients with IgAN, we aim to identify independent predictive factors associated with disease progression to
ESRD. We collected retrospective clinical data and renal outcomes on 619 biopsy-diagnosed IgAN patients with a mean
follow-up time of 41.3 months. In total, 67 individuals reached the study endpoint defined by occurrence of ESRD
necessitating renal replacement therapy. In the fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, there were four baseline
variables with a significant independent effect on the risk of ESRD. These included: eGFR [HR = 0.96(0.95–0.97)], serum
albumin [HR = 0.47(0.32–0.68)], hemoglobin [HR = 0.79(0.72–0.88)], and SBP [HR = 1.02(1.00–1.03)]. Based on these
observations, we developed a 4-variable equation of a clinical risk score for disease progression. Our risk score explained
nearly 22% of the total variance in the primary outcome. Survival ROC curves revealed that the risk score provided improved
prediction of ESRD at 24th, 60th and 120th month of follow-up compared to the three previously proposed risk scores. In
summary, our data indicate that IgAN patients with higher systolic blood pressure, lower eGFR, hemoglobin, and albumin
levels at baseline are at a greatest risk of progression to ESRD. The new progression risk score calculated based on these
four baseline variables offers a simple clinical tool for risk stratification.

Introduction
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary
glomerulonephritis (GN) worldwide [1]. The disease is character￾ized by a highly variable clinical course ranging from a benign
condition to a rapidly progressive irreversible kidney failure. About
15 to 40 percent of IgAN patients will develop worsening renal
dysfunction and eventually end stage renal disease (ESRD) within
10–20 years of diagnosis [2,3,4]. A major challenge in the field is the
identification of individuals at highest risk of progression to ESRD.
Notably, IgAN is most prevalent in Asia, and studies suggest that the
disease may have a more severe course in individuals of Asian
ancestry [5,6]. Thus, studies based on Asian populations may be
more effective in identifying risk factors for progression.
Numerous prior studies identified several potential clinical
predictors of progression, including degree of renal impairment at
diagnosis [2,7,8,9], histologic grading [2,7,8,9,10] and proteinuria
[10,11,12]_ENREF_8. These factors appear to contribute indepen￾dently to the risk of progression in multivariate models. Moreover,
some studies suggest an independent prognostic value of high blood
pressure at presentation [6,7,10] ?r during follow-up [12], hematuria
[9], family history of hypertension [7] or chronic renal failure [9],
serum albumin level [9,13], age [9], and male gender [9].
One of the problems in the field is that several of the above
predictors reflect the degree of disease severity on presentation and
are thus strongly inter-correlated. Their individual contribution to
the overall risk of progression is difficult to assess without powerful
and well-characterized patient cohorts. In addition, the overall
predictive value of these variables is relatively low. The
development of a risk score that reflects cumulative effects of
individual predictors may be helpful to identify individuals that are
most likely to progress to ESRD. This approach has been
successfully utilized in the RENAAL study of 1,513 type 2
diabetics with nephropathy [14]. Based on the longitudinal data
from this study, a relatively simple risk score was proposed that
incorporates serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio into an equation that accurately
determines the risk of progression to ESRD. Another powerful
example of this approach is provided by a large-scale progression
study of all-cause chronic kidney disease (CKD) [15]. Here, the
most accurate model that predicted ESRD included age, sex,
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e38904

eGFR, albuminuria, as well as basic serum measurements of
calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and albumin. This model was
further validated in an independent cohort of 4,942 patients with
an estimated C-statistic of 0.84 (95%CI 0.83–0.86).
To date, there have been two studies that applied a similar
approach to the prediction of ESRD in patients with newly
diagnosed IgAN: the study by Berthoux et al. of 332 French patients
followed for a median of 136 months [10] and the study by Goto et
al. of 2,283 Japanese patients followed for a median of 87 months
[9]. The French study derived a 3-variable risk score (based on
hypertension, proteinuria, and a histology score), while the Japanese
study derived an 8-variable score (based on age, gender, hyperten￾sion, proteinuria, hematuria, hypoalbuminaemia, eGFR, and
histological grade). The performance of these risk scores, however,
has not yet been validated in independent cohorts.
In this study, we systematically evaluate the predictive value of a
complete set of baseline clinical and laboratory factors in the

progression of renal disease in a large cohort of IgAN patients
from Shanghai, China. We formulate a new 4-variable risk score
equation that best predicts renal disease progression in our cohort.
We also compare the performance of our Risk Score to the French
and the Japanese progression scores, as well as to the risk score
based on the RENAAL study.
Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of
Medicine and was in accordance with the principle of the Helsinki
Declaration II. The written informed consent was obtained from
each participant.
Study Population and Clinical Data
To identify cases eligible to participate in the study, we reviewed
all kidney biopsy reports of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Ruijin
Hospital, a major referral center for Southern China, between
years 1989 and 2010. All cases included in the study were defined
by dominant and at least 2+ (on a scale from 0 to 3+) mesangial
staining for IgA by immunoflorescence, in addition to compatible
findings of mesangial expansion or proliferation on light micros￾copy. The patients with systemic diseases, such as systemic lupus
erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and chronic liver
disease were excluded from this analysis. We also recruited a large
group of age and gender matched healthy controls from the Ruijin
Hospital Health Care Center defined by the absence of
abnormalities on a routine urinalysis and normal renal function
(serum creatinine ,1.1 mg/dL).
In total, 619 individuals fulfilled our diagnostic criteria for IgAN
and had a minimum of 3 months of follow-up data available for
analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected
from all patients at the time of renal biopsy. These included: age,
gender, body mass index (BMI), serum creatinine, serum uric acid
(UA), triglyceride levels, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin (Hb),
systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
family history of kidney disease, history of gross hematuria, serum
immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, and 24-hour protein excretion.
The diagnosis of hypertension was based on SBP$140 mmHg, or
DBP$90 mmHg, or history of antihypertensive medication use.
Hyperuricemia was defined by gender-specific criteria of serum
UA .450 umol/L in males and .340 umol/L in females.
Anemia was defined by gender-specific criteria of hemoglobin
concentrations ,13.5 g/dL in males and ,12 g/dL in females.
Hypoalbuminemia was defined by serum albumin ,3 g/dL.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated by an
abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
equation modified for Chinese: eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2
)
= 186*Pcr 21
.
154*age 20
.
203*0.742(if female)*1.233 [16]. Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) was classified based to the Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) practice guidelines [17].
Most patients were treated according to the accepted standards at
our center: IgAN patients with hypertension and/or proteinuria
were treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARB). Glucocortoids were added in individuals
with a new onset of massive proteinuria, and proteinuric patients
who did not respond to an ACEI or ARB therapy. Patients with
crescentic disease and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were
treated with combined immunosuppressive agents and glucocor￾ticoids. The mean follow-up time after renal biopsy was 41.3
months (range 3.03–248.1 months).
Statistical Methods
The distributions of quantitative variables were assessed for
normality and summarized as means and standard deviations (or
medians and ranges for non-normally distributed variables).
Statistical testing of continuous variables was performed using
Student’s t-test (or Mann-Whitney U-test if appropriate). All
categorical variables were expressed as frequencies or percentages
(%) and comparison of proportions was performed using a standard
X2 test. Baseline clinical variables included sex, age, family history,
BMI, baseline serum creatinine, eGFR, SBP, DBP, mean arterial
pressure, pulse pressure, urine protein, gross hematuria, serum UA,
serum albumin, serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, hemoglobin,
platelets, WBC, serum IgA, Haas classification, and treatment type.
All slides of kidney biopsies were reviewed by a single experienced

renal pathologist. The primary outcome was defined as occurrence
of ESRD defined by a need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis
or renal transplantation). The association of baseline variables with
the primary outcome was tested using Cox regression proportional
hazards models. A two sided P,0.05 was considered statistically
significant. To identify independent predictors of progression, we
performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis with a stepwise
selection of variables (entry and elimination P,0.05). Patients were
censored at the time of death or loss to follow-up. The proportional
hazards assumption was formally tested for each of the outcomes
using the method proposed by Grambsch and Therneau [18] and
implemented in the R survival package version 2.36 (R v.2.9). The
independent predictors retained in the final model were used to
derive the Risk Score. The effects of each independent predictor, as
well as their cumulative effect in the form of the Risk Score were
next tested using the Kaplan-Meier approach. We also scored our
patients using the Japanese [9], the French [10] and the RENAAL
[14] risk scores. The R2 (reflecting the fraction of variance in the
primary outcome explained) was determined for each of the models
[19]. In addition, survival areas under receiver operating charac￾teristic (ROC) curves were also assessed for the 24th, 60th and 120th
month time points. These analyses were performed using Survcomp
[20] package version 1.1.6 (R v.2.9) and ROCR package version
1.0–2 (R v.2.9) [21]. Based on the size and median follow-up of our
cohort, we estimate 80% power to detect hazard ratios greater than

Results
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Data
We analyzed clinical data from a total of 619 IgAN patients
(Table 1). There were 314 males and 305 females in the study; the
average age was 36612 years. Of all the IgAN patients, 78
(12.6%) had positive family history of chronic kidney disease. Most
IgAN patients had moderate to severe pathology grade at
diagnosis (75.4% with Haas III-V). Moreover, 46.9% were
hypertensive, 61.7% had urine protein higher than 1 g/24 h,
and 20.2% reported history of gross hematuria (Table 1). We first
explored the associations of clinical variables with baseline renal
function (eGFR). In univariate analyses, 17 of 25 baseline clinical
variables correlated with the degree of renal impairment at the
time of biopsy (Table S1). In multivariate analysis, older age
[beta = 21.06, p,2.0*10216], higher degree of proteinuria
[beta = 25.18, p = 2*1023
], elevated UA [beta = 28.23,
p,2.0*10216], higher Haas grade [beta = 211.3,
p = ,2.0*10216), lower hemoglobin, [beta = 2.90, p = 9*1027
]
and increased SBP [beta = 20.37, p = 2*1027
] were independent￾ly associated with lower eGFR at the time of biopsy (Table S2).
Predictors of Progression in IgAN
In total, 67 individuals reached the study endpoint defined as
occurrence of ESRD. In univariate analyses, 21 of 30 baseline
variables were significantly associated with this outcome (Table 2).
In the multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards models,
only four baseline variables had a significant, independent effect
on the risk of ESRD (Model 1): baseline eGFR [HR = 0.96, 95%
CI 0.95–0.97, p = 1.3*10214], serum albumin [HR = 0.47, 95%
CI 0.32–0.68, p = 7.4*1025
], hemoglobin [HR = 0.79, 95% CI
0.72–0.88, p = 1.2*1025
], and SBP [HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–
1.03, p = 5.4*1023
] (Table 3). Similarly, the same four variables
were also highly significant independent predictors of eGFR
decline (defined as 50% reduction from the baseline eGFR) in our
cohort (Model 2): baseline eGFR [HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.98–0.99,
p = 1.6*1028
], serum albumin [HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.35–0.62,
p = 2.7*1027
], hemoglobin [HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.89,
p = 1.5*1026
], and SBP [HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.03,
p = 6.4*1023
]. We also explored all pairwise interactions and
considered quadratic terms in these models, but none these
alternative analyses provided a better fit to the data.
As expected, eGFR at presentation was the strongest predictor
of ESRD: each unit decrease in baseline eGFR was associated with
4% increase in the risk of ESRD during the follow-up period.
Accordingly, individuals with baseline eGFR .60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 had considerably longer median outcome-free survival
time when compared to those with eGFR ,60 ml/min/1.73 m2

(242 months versus 72 months) [HR = 7.91, 95%CI: 4.60–13.60,
Figure 1A].
On average, the cases were three times more likely to fulfill our
diagnostic criteria for anemia compared to the healthy population
controls (42.2% vs. 14.5%) (Table S3). Each unit drop in
hemoglobin was associated with 20% increase in the risk of
ESRD. Median outcome-free survival times were 104 and 247
months in individuals with and without the diagnosis of anemia,
respectively [HR = 4.98, 95% CI 2.80–8.85, Figure 1B]. In
addition to the risk of ESRD, anemia was associated with male
sex, older age, lower eGFR, higher SBP, more severe proteinuria,
higher uric acid level, lower albumin level, and more severe Haas
class (Table S4). Individuals with low hemoglobin levels were also
more frequently treated with glucocorticoids.
The patients with hypoalbuminemia had a shorter median
ESRD-free survival of 122 months, compared to 145 months for
those with normal albumin levels [HR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.48–4.07,
Figure 1C]. Serum albumin was strongly correlated with daily
protein excretion (Figure 2C-E, Table S4). Surprisingly, protein￾uria did not independently contribute to the risk of ESRD in
multivariate analysis. We formally explored if albumin and/or
hemoglobin account for the effect of proteinuria in the final risk
model (Table S5). The exclusion of albumin from the full model
unmasked highly significant association of proteinuria with the risk
of progression (HR 1.56, p = 9.761023
), but at the cost of overall
reduction in the model’s goodness of fit. This suggests that
albumin is a superior predictor of outcome and captures most of
the variance contributed by proteinuria.
Progression Risk Score
Next we developed a risk score for disease progression based on
the regression coefficients for the four independent predictors
retained in the best model (Table 3). The risk score equation is
provided by the following formula:
RiskScore~6:932{
0:039  ð Þ eGFR ml ½  =min=1:73m {0:230  ð Þ Hb g½  =dL
{0:762  ð Þ serumalbumin g½  =dL z0:016  ð Þ SBP mmHg ½  :
When considered in a stepwise multivariate analysis with all 21
other baseline variables at entry, the risk score was the only
independent predictor of adverse renal outcome. It conveyed 2.7-
fold increase in the risk of ESRD per one score unit [HR = 2.73,
95%CI: 2.27–3.28] and explained 21.9% of the total variance in
the primary outcome. The median ESRD-free survival times for
the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles of the Risk Score were 247,
147, and 65 months, respectively. Accordingly, when compared to
the first tertile, individuals in the second Risk Score tertile had a 15-
fold increase in the risk of ESRD [HR = 15.3, 95%CI: 2.0–115.0)],
while individuals in the highest tertile had over 79-fold risk increase
[HR = 79.8, 95%CI 11.0–580.3] (Figure 3A and Table S6).
Survival ROC analysis revealed that the risk score provided
considerably improved discriminative power at 24, 60 and 120
months of follow-up compared to individual predictors. The area
under the survival ROC curves was estimated at 0.95 (95%CI:
0.93–0.97) at 24 months, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91) at 60 months,
and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.82–0.88) at 120 months of follow-up.
Impressively, at the cutoff point of 3.27, the Risk Score’s sensitivity
and specificity of predicting ESRD within 2 years of diagnosis
were 87.5% and 96.0%, respectively (Figure 3B).
Next, we compared the performance of the three other
published risk scores in predicting ESRD in our dataset
(Figure 4). The Goto et al. Japanese progression score performed
better compared to the Berthoux et al. and the RENAAL scores,
with the AUC of 0.93, 0.87 and 0.82 at 24, 60, and 120 months of
follow-up, respectively. This score explained 14.4%, 17.9% and
18.3% of variance in the primary outcome for each respective
follow-up period. The performance of the Goto et al. score was
only slightly worse compared to the Risk Score derived in our
study (AUC of 0.95, 0.88, and 0.85; variance explained: 16.2%,
20.3% and 22.3%). The RENAAL risk score provided slightly less
accurate prediction compared to the Goto et al. score, with
respective AUCs of 0.92, 0.85, and 0.79. These differences in
performance are likely due to the fact that this score was originally
derived for patients with diabetic nephropathy. Finally, the risk
score proposed by Berthoux et al. was considerably less accurate,
with respective AUCs of 0.77, 0.75 and 0.73.

New Clinical Progression Risk Score of IgAN

Discussion
IgAN is a progressive disease with high variability of clinical
presentation and outcomes [23]. Presently, clinician’s ability to
identify patients at a highest risk of progression is limited. Such
patients, however, are more likely to benefit from early or more
aggressive therapy. In this study, we systematically test a complete
set of over 28 baseline clinical parameters in multivariate models
to detect independent predictors of renal disease progression. This
is one of the largest observational studies of IgAN, involving over
600 patients. Accordingly, we are well powered to detect relatively
small effect sizes. Other strengths of our study include: homog￾enous patient cohort, uniform histology scoring of renal biopsies,
and application of a robust definition of progression (ESRD
requiring renal replacement therapy).
To our knowledge, our study is the first to identify hemoglobin
level as an independent risk factor for progression of IgAN. In the
adjusted models, each 1 g/dL drop in hemoglobin was associated
with 20% increase in the risk of renal progression. Additionally,
hemoglobin levels explained nearly 6.4% of variance in renal
outcome. Anemia is a common complication of CKD that has
recently emerged as an important independent risk factor for
kidney disease progression [24,25]. For example, in the RENNAL
cohort, baseline hemoglobin concentration was inversely correlat￾ed with the risk of ESRD, with the average increase in the risk of
11% per each 1 g/dL decline in hemoglobin levels after
adjustment for baseline renal function and other covariates. The
exact mechanism that underlies these observations is not clear. It is
possible that anemia has a direct causal effect on the deterioration
of renal function. Alternatively, this association may reflect the
severity of underlying systemic inflammation, or may mark
additional kidney damage that is not yet reflected by a decline
in eGFR.
In addition to hemoglobin levels, our study provides strong
support for predictive value of serum albumin in the assessment of
ESRD risk. Serum albumin is widely recognized as a biomarker of
nutritional status and inflammation, but it is also closely correlated
with age, proteinuria, and hemoglobin levels (Figure 3C-D, Table
S4). Multiple prior studies have found independent associations of
low serum albumin with disease progression outcomes among
patients with diabetic nephropathy and CKD [14,15,25,26,27,28].
Thus, similar to hemoglobin levels, our study contributes to the
growing evidence for hypoalbuminemia as a major risk factor for
ESRD and validates its utility in patients with IgA nephropathy.
Our findings also confirm strong independent associations of
decreased eGFR, and elevated SBP with accelerated renal disease
progression. These clinical parameters are among the most
consistently reported predictors of progression, with similar
findings observed across multiple cohorts [29,30,31,32].
Interestingly, proteinuria was strongly associated with the risk of
ESRD in univariate analysis, however, it did not independently
contribute to the risk in multivariate models. Notably, urinary
protein had strong inverse correlation with serum albumin.
Accordingly, inclusion of albumin in the prediction model
captured most of the variance in outcome contributed by
proteinuria. Although albumin appears to be a superior predictor

of progression in our cohort, it is also possible that additional
predictive value of proteinuria would become more evident with
larger cohort size or longer follow-up.
Based on our results, we formulated a new four-variable risk
score model for predicting ESRD. Our Risk Score explained
nearly 22% of the total variance in the outcome. In addition, when
tested against the three previously proposed scores, our Risk Score
provided improved prediction of ESRD at 24th, 60th and 120th
month of follow-up.
Previously, the largest and most comprehensive IgAN progres￾sion study with a similar endpoint of ESRD was performed in
Japanese individuals by Goto et al. [9] This nation-wide study
followed 2,283 IgAN patients from 97 clinical units in Japan for a
median of 87 months with the primary outcome of ESRD. The
study formulated an 8-variable progression score that included
age, gender, hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, hypoalbumin￾aemia, eGFR, and histological grade. In our study, we provide the
first independent validation of this risk score. However, our Risk
Score had better discrimination power despite comprising of a
smaller number of variables. It is noteworthy that the Japanese
study did not consider hemoglobin levels and/or anemia diagnosis
as potential predictors of ESRD. Based on our findings, the
addition of anemia would significantly strengthen their model.
Other risk scoring systems, such as the Bethoux et al. [10] or the
Bartosik et al. [33] are not directly comparable to our risk score
because they did not examine hemoglobin, serum albumin, or
other baseline laboratory measurements. The Bethoux’s formula
incorporates proteinuria, hypertension, and histology score, while
the Bartosik’s formula includes mean arterial pressure and
proteinuria, but requires follow-up data of at least 2 years. Neither
of these risk scores uses the generally accepted Haas or Oxford
classification systems. Not surprisingly, the Berthoux risk score did
not perform well in predicting ESRD in our dataset. Although the
Bartosik formula was validated by another small cohort [34], it
uses a less definitive clinical outcome (slope of eGFR decline) and
the requirement of two year’s follow-up has limited its routine
implementation.
We also compared our risk score with the RENAAL progression
score, which was based on a powerful and well-characterized
cohort of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Similar to our study,
RENAAL score included both baseline hemoglobin and serum
albumin. The finding that we identify the same risk factors for
progression as in the RENAAL study strongly suggests that the
same factors affect nephropathy progression regardless of the
original insult.
While our risk score is highly promising, it will require
validation in independent cohorts. Moreover, our data is based
on a retrospective chart reviews, and a prospective evaluation of
this score would be useful, perhaps in more ethnically diverse
patients. In addition, newer pathology classifications, as well as
novel genetic and serologic markers are likely to enhance the
predictive power of our risk score. For example, we have
previously demonstrated that levels of galactose-deficient IgA1
are elevated in IgAN and may have a diagnostic value [35,36]?
Moreover, we have recently discovered five new genetic suscep￾tibility loci for IgAN in a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
[37]. The predictive value of both, galactose-deficient IgA1 as well
as GWAS susceptibility alleles on disease progression has not yet
been evaluated. Finally, the new Oxford classification of IgAN
holds promise to improve risk prediction compared to the Haas
grading [38]. Thus, inclusion of newer pathologic scores, and
novel biomarkers may further improve the performance of the risk
score and enable better risk stratification.
In summary, our new 4-variable Risk Score model is highly
predictive of an individual risk of disease progression, explaining
nearly 22% of the variance in outcome. In contrast with prior
studies, there are three main advantages of this Risk Score: (1) the
score equation is relatively simple, thus it is easy to implement in
clinical practice, (2) the score has a superb sensitivity and
specificity to predict ESRD when compared with other proposed
scoring systems, and (3) our score is based entirely on the objective
clinical variables that include routine laboratory measurements
available for all newly diagnosed patients in clinical practice.
