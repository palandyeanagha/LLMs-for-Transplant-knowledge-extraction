Abstract
Evolution of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) technology has added a new dimension to the intensive care
management of acute cardiac and/or respiratory failure in adult patients who fail conventional treatment. ECLS also
complements cardiac surgical and cardiology procedures, implantation of long-term mechanical cardiac assist
devices, heart and lung transplantation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Available ECLS therapies provide a range
of options to the multidisciplinary teams who are involved in the time-critical care of these complex patients. While
venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide complete respiratory support,
extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal facilitates protective lung ventilation and provides only partial respiratory
support. Mechanical circulatory support with venoarterial (VA) ECMO employed in a traditional central/peripheral
fashion or in a temporary ventricular assist device configuration may stabilise patients with decompensated cardiac
failure who have evidence of end-organ dysfunction, allowing time for recovery, decision-making, and bridging to
implantation of a long-term mechanical circulatory support device and occasionally heart transplantation. In highly
selected patients with combined severe cardiac and respiratory failure, advanced ECLS can be provided with central
VA ECMO, peripheral VA ECMO with timely transition to venovenous ECMO or VA-venous ECMO upon myocardial
recovery to avoid upper body hypoxia or by addition of an oxygenator to the temporary ventricular assist device
circuit. This article summarises the available ECLS options and provides insights into the principles and practice of
these techniques. One should emphasise that, as is common with many emerging therapies, their optimal use is
currently not backed by quality evidence. This deficiency needs to be addressed to ensure that the full potential of
ECLS can be achieved.
Review
Introduction
Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a therapeutic op￾tion increasingly used in the management of patients
with cardiorespiratory failure that is refractory to max￾imal conventional treatment [1,2]. This support may fa￾cilitate therapeutic intervention, bridge to recovery,
bridge to a long-term support device, heart or lung
transplantation, or bridge to palliation. Despite the
renewed interest in ECLS technology following the 2009
H1N1 influenza pandemic [3], there is a lack of
definitive evidence regarding its routine application.
Current ECLS equipment has evolved to allow a pleth￾ora of perfusion strategies enabling tailored temporary
support for patients and the ability to transition between
configurations. A number of factors limit more frequent
utilisation. These factors include challenges in patient
selection, choice of an appropriate strategy, technical as￾pects of initiation and maintenance, and minimising
complications [4].
This review provides a summary of the available ECLS
options and cannulation techniques for short-term sup￾port of adult patients with cardiorespiratory failure that
is refractory to conventional treatment.

Extracorporeal respiratory support for respiratory
failure
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
Details about the technology, principles and practice of
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be
found elsewhere [5,6]. Venovenous (VV) ECMO is pre￾dominantly used as a rescue therapy for selected patients
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and re￾fractory hypoxia [1,7,8]. Patients with refractory hypoxia
due to ARDS continue to have a high mortality, in the
order of 70 to 90%. Whether VV ECMO further improves
survival in this group of patients when compared with
lung-protective ventilation (LPV) and adjuncts such as
neuromuscular blockade [9] and prone ventilation [10] is
yet to be established. Recent studies demonstrating harm
or no benefit with the use of high-frequency oscillation in
patients with moderate to severe ARDS exclude this tech￾nique as a routine rescue option for refractory hypoxia and
may further expand the scope of VV ECMO [11,12]. Des￾pite unfavourable results in the early studies, the CESAR
trial showed improved disability-free survival at 6 months
in 90 patients who were randomised to receive ECMO
(37% vs. 53% on LPV, P = 0.03) [13]. However, 22 of these
patients did not receive ECMO and a majority of them im￾proved with LPV. The study was criticised for lack of
standardisation of LPV in the control group. This may not
be seen as definitive evidence supporting the use of VV
ECMO. However, the CESAR trial and the UK data from
patients with H1N1-related ARDS do confirm that referral
to an ECMO centre may lower hospital mortality com￾pared with matched non-ECMO-referred patients [14].
Analysis of 2009 H1N1 pandemic data [3,15-18] dem￾onstrates that while VV ECMO may be in equipoise with
LPV, it may play a vital role in younger patients with
critical oxygenation who have fewer failed organ systems
and fail LPV [8]. Although VV ECMO is relatively easy to
institute technically, the complexities relate more to the
availability of the service, practicalities of transfer to an
ECLS centre, timing and patient selection, care of the pa￾tient on ECMO and minimising complications [4]. Pa￾tients often need to be retrieved whilst supported by
ECMO, and data suggest that this can be undertaken
safely in trained hands with an appropriate system [19].
VV ECMO and the more portable proprietary extracor￾poreal respiratory support devices such as Cardiohelp™
(Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) can
be utilised for transport [20].
A number of configurations of VV ECMO can be applied
based on individual patient requirements (Table 1).
Although there are many other factors, patient arterial oxy￾genation is critically dependent on the fraction of total car￾diac output passing through the oxygenator while adequate
carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance can still occur with lower
blood flows [21]. The bicaval dual-lumen Avalon™ cannula
(Avalon Laboratory, Los Angeles, CA, USA) inserted
through the internal jugular vein allows single-site cannula￾tion for VV ECMO [22], but flows are unlikely to be as high
compared with the use of two large venous drainage cannu￾lae positioned in the venae cavae via internal jugular and
femoral veins. Additionally, meticulous positioning is re￾quired, usually with transoesophageal echocardiography.
Use of a dual-lumen cannula in the neck may facilitate mo￾bilisation in bed, extubation and rehabilitation in patients
who receive prolonged ECMO support [22].
Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal
Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, although usually
well tolerated, is a barrier to implementing ultra￾Table 1 Available extracorporeal respiratory support devices and strategies

protective ventilation [21]. This barrier has renewed
interest in extracorporeal technologies that facilitate
extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCOR). Refinements in
technology [21,23] have resulted in fewer complications
when used as adjuncts to LPV [24], but definitive evi￾dence is lacking [25].
ECCOR requires an arterial or venous access cannula,
a pump to drain blood during venous access, a mem￾brane lung and a return venous cannula. Heparin-coated
wire-reinforced cannulae may be placed percutaneously
in a femoral–femoral or a femoral–jugular orientation.
Alternatively, a wire-reinforced double-lumen catheter
may be inserted under ultrasound guidance via the right
internal jugular vein with the drainage port positioned
in the intra-hepatic inferior vena cava and the return
port in the right atrium [21,26]. A flow of fresh gas con￾taining little or no CO2 is utilised to create a diffusion
gradient across the membrane and allows CO2 removal.
While ECMO necessitates high blood flow rates (5 to
7 l/minute) to ensure optimal oxygenation, ECCOR al￾lows CO2 removal at much lower blood flow rates (<1 l/
minute) due to significant differences in CO2 and oxygen
kinetics [21,23]. Although lower blood flows can be
achieved with smaller cannulae with greater ease, vascu￾lar complications may still occur especially with arterial
cannulation.
Various novel ECCOR devices are currently available
to facilitate LPV and are reviewed in detail elsewhere
[21,23]. The available and emerging devices are sum￾marised in Table 1. The pumpless interventional lung as￾sist iLA™ membrane ventilator marketed by Novalung
GmbH (Hechingen, Germany) is a low-gradient device
(Figure 1) that can be employed peripherally (femoral ar￾tery access and femoral vein return) and allows complete
CO2 removal in patients with adequate oxygenation and
robust haemodynamics. There have been reports of its
successful use in patients with ARDS [28] and severe
asthma [29] and as a bridge to lung transplantation [30].
However, the risks of arterial access have to be carefully
considered in these patients. The pulmonary artery–left
atrial configuration of the same device has been used as
a bridge to lung transplantation particularly in those
who have significant pulmonary hypertension [31]. A VV
configuration of the membrane oxygenator with a pump
(iLA™ Activve; Novalung GmbH) is also available for
partial or complete respiratory support [32].
Devices such as the Decap™ system (Hemodec, Sal￾erno, Italy) that serve the dual purpose of renal replace￾ment therapy and ECCOR are also available [33]. By
combining the membrane lung and the pump into a sin￾gle unit, the Hemolung™ (Alung Technologies, Pitts￾burgh, PA, USA) achieves efficient CO2 removal at flows
between 400 and 600 ml/minute [21] using dual-lumen
catheters similar to those used for renal replacement
therapy. These low-flow systems provide partial CO2 re￾moval only and do not provide any oxygenation benefit.
Even though modern low-flow VV ECCOR devices re￾portedly require a lower degree of anticoagulation, con￾cerns remain over risks of circuit thrombosis. Other
emerging technologies such as intravascular gas ex￾change and respiratory dialysis [21] are beyond the scope
of this article. Similarly, bridging the acutely ill patients
to lung transplantation [34,35] with ECLS is a highly
specialised service beyond the scope of this review.
Extracorporeal respiratory support can thus be pro￾vided with ECCOR or ECMO depending on the lung
pathology, pulmonary compliance and oxygenation and
decarboxylation requirements of an individual patient.
ECMO and ECCOR can also bridge highly selected pa￾tients to lung transplantation.
Extracorporeal life support in acute cardiac failure
Providing temporary mechanical circulatory support
(MCS) support to patients with acute refractory cardiac
failure using ECLS techniques is a rapidly evolving area;
intervention may be time critical and mortality is higher
than ECLS for isolated respiratory failure [36,37]. The
use of ECLS in the setting of cardiopulmonary resuscita￾tion is discussed elsewhere [38,39]. Patient outcomes
with the use of long-term ventricular assist devices
(VADs) in cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS class 1) are
poor [40,41]. Recently published International Society
for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for MCS

GmbH, Talheim, Germany) for pumpless arterio-venous carbon
dioxide removal. Reproduced with permission from [27].

provide recommendations for long-term MCS options
for patients with cardiac failure [42], and these are not
discussed in this article. These guidelines strongly rec￾ommend consideration of the use of temporary MCS in
patients with multiorgan failure, with sepsis or on mech￾anical ventilation to allow successful optimisation of
their clinical status and neurologic assessment prior to
placement of a long-term MCS device [42].
The severity of noncardiac organ system failures can be
defined using scoring systems such as the Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment score. Severe multiorgan failure
(for example, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score
>15) has been considered a contraindication to VV ECMO
[43] and similar criteria may be applicable for venoarterial
(VA) ECMO or for the use of an ECMO circuit as a tem￾porary VAD. Factors considered in the initial cannulation
strategy include: the underlying cause of cardiac dysfunc￾tion and projected time course of recovery; the severity of
pulmonary dysfunction and projected time course of
recovery; the functional reserve of each ventricle; the pres￾ence and severity of valvular pathology; risk of arterial ac￾cess and size of vessels; the severity of coagulopathy and
risk of sternotomy; and planned future surgery, such as
long-term VAD or transplant.
For patients with predominant cardiac failure with
preserved pulmonary function, the available MCS de￾vices provide several options (Table 2). Central VA
ECMO has been traditionally applied as a bridge to re￾covery in patients who fail to wean from cardiopulmo￾nary bypass after cardiac surgery (Figure 2). Central VA
ECMO outside this setting in adults is uncommon. Fem￾oral VA ECMO (Figure 2) is more commonly used in
adults requiring urgent cardiac support because it can
be achieved rapidly and a sternotomy is avoided. One of
the major limitations of peripheral femoro-femoral VA
ECMO is left ventricular (LV) afterload mismatch and

is often guided by the clinical setting, the expected duration of support and pulmonary function.

inadequate LV decompression/venting. This limitation is
particularly so in patients with very low native cardiac
output states and severe mitral valve regurgitation, and
may result in severe hydrostatic pulmonary oedema in
some patients. Although some centres use an intra￾aortic balloon pump in conjunction with peripheral VA
ECMO to reduce LV afterload and pulmonary conges￾tion, no definitive data exist to support routine use.
LV and aortic root stasis from lack of cardiac ejection
and failure of aortic valve opening may result in cata￾strophic intracardiac and aortic root thrombosis. In￾creased anticoagulation to minimise this risk may
heighten the risk of significant bleeding. Minimally inva￾sive strategies such as percutaneous transseptal left atrial
decompression [44] and subxiphoid surgical approaches
to drain the left ventricle [45] have been described to re￾duce LV distension. The residual atrial defect may re￾quire correction once the patient has been weaned from
mechanical support. Use of a percutaneously inserted
VAD (Impella™; Abiomed, Aachen, Germany) to decom￾press the left ventricle has also been reported in this set￾ting [46], alleviating the need for a high-risk septostomy
or surgical venting.
Femoral VA ECMO is also limited by femoral arterial
size, and thus cannula size and the requirement for distal
limb perfusion. Given its less invasive nature (compared
with thoracic access), peripheral VA ECMO – with atten￾tion to optimal LV afterload, minimising LV distension
with optimal fluid and inotrope therapy, anticoagulation
and pulmonary management – is a viable first-line option
for patients with isolated acute cardiac failure refractory
to conventional management.
The limitations of peripheral VA ECMO have
prompted the use of ECMO devices [47] to facilitate
ventricular unloading by changing to a temporary left
ventricular assist device (LVAD) or a biventricular assist
device configuration (Figure 3). Any perfusion strategy
that creates a right to left shunt requires an oxygenator
in the circuit. Oxygenators may additionally provide
temperature control. This strategy effectively provides
biventricular support and gas exchange through a single
pump configuration with the ability to cease right
ventricular (RV) support when not required. However,
this configuration requires sternotomy and cannulation
of the left ventricle (or left atrium) and aorta. A reopera￾tion (sternotomy or thoracotomy) is then required for
explantation of the cannulae upon cardiac recovery or
for implantation of a long-term mechanical assist device.
Less invasive techniques for temporary cardiorespira￾tory support including a transition strategy to an
intermediate-term support configuration [48] allowing
mobilisation have been described (Figure 4). Although

this configuration requires a left thoracotomy, sternot￾omy is avoided, potentially reducing risk for subsequent
surgery in the absence of cardiac recovery (long-term
VAD implantation as a bridge to destination or heart
transplantation).
Temporary RV support can be provided with the Cen￾trimag™ ECMO system (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA,
USA) through percutaneous femoral venous access to
the right atrium and return to the pulmonary artery via
a cannulated exteriorised Dacron graft. This strategy is
described for temporary support of the RV with inser￾tion of a long-term LVAD but is applicable to other
causes of severe isolated RV dysfunction. An oxygenator
can be included in the circuit to ensure adequate oxy￾genation, CO2 removal and temperature regulation.
Upon RV recovery, the graft can be ligated and buried
upon decannulation without re-sternotomy.
Percutaneously inserted LVADs such as TandemHeart™
(CardiacAssist, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and Impella™
(Abiomed) [49] are potential options for MCS in the
acute setting. However, there is a paucity of supportive
evidence for their use and the complications with arter￾ial access such as bleeding and limb ischemia cannot be
understated. TandemHeart™ utilises a centrifugal pump
to drain the left atrial blood from a catheter placed
transeptally via the femoral vein and returns it to the
femoral artery. The Impella™ device uses an axial pump
that is inserted retrogradely across the aortic valve via
the femoral artery. These devices provide LV support
and lack the ability to provide extracorporeal respiratory
support if required. However, there are case reports per￾taining to their successful use as RV assist devices and/
or biventricular assist devices [50,51].
Even though the third-generation, implantable LVADs
designed for long-term MCS are a significant improve￾ment on earlier devices [52], their use in a deteriorating
patient with multiorgan dysfunction is associated with
poor outcomes and is not currently recommended.
Advanced extracorporeal life support in severe
cardiorespiratory failure
The number of patients with severe combined cardiac
and respiratory failure who fail conventional treatment
is very small and ECLS in this group is controversial, be￾ing considered either heroic or futile. In the setting of
pneumonia or sepsis and severe cardiac dysfunction,
where feasible, VV ECMO with inotropic support should
be the initial perfusion strategy [53]. Septic myocardial
depression may improve with management of the sepsis,
improved oxygenation and normalisation of respiratory
acidosis [54]. Peripheral femoral VA ECMO (Figure 2)
may be considered a rescue option for these patients if

http://ccforum.com/content/18/2/219

myocardial depression is profound [55] or if the diagno￾sis is uncertain and conditions such as myocarditis are
considered likely. Use of this strategy in septic patients
with multiple organ failure who may have severe coagu￾lation and hepatic dysfunction may be futile. However,
heroic measures can result in good outcomes [56].
Upper body hypoxia can occur if myocardial recovery
occurs and lung function remains poor. This may be over￾come by transition to VV ECMO if myocardial recovery is
satisfactory or with the use of VA–venous ECMO, which
allows return of oxygenated blood to both arterial and
venous sides of the circulation, thereby minimising the
risk of upper-body hypoxia. Although peripheral arterial
cannulation for VA–venous ECMO is less invasive and is
an attractive option, balancing the oxygenation and perfu￾sion needs of an individual patient by regulating the return
of oxygenated blood to the underperfused coronary and
cerebral circulation may be challenging, and a central con￾figuration may be preferred in this setting. Returning the
oxygenated blood in the ascending aorta by cannulating
the axillary [57,58] or subclavian artery cannulation has
also been described (Figure 2) in this setting. However, ax￾illary artery side graft cannulation may be complicated by
ipsilateral upper-limb hyperperfusion and bleeding from
the arterial graft [59].
A more invasive, high-risk option in this setting in￾cludes use of the Centrimag™ ECMO system (Levitronix
LLC) as a temporary LVAD/biventricular assist device
with an oxygenator in the circuit. The device can be
employed in several configurations (Table 3) to support
both the left and/or right ventricles and the oxygenator
can be removed from the circuit when pulmonary func￾tion stabilises. This strategy can support patients for a
longer period of time, allowing more time to recover,
and minimises the risks of LV distension and throm￾bosis. This is ideally suited to patients with suspected
acute myocarditis in whom myocardial recovery is pos￾sible but prolonged support may be required. Alterna￾tively, central VA ECMO may be used in a patient in
extremis [60,61] when femoral cannulation is expected
to be difficult. Regardless of the initial strategy used,
transition to VV ECMO (Figure 5) should be considered
as soon as adequate cardiac function returns and is
pragmatically possible. Continued vigilance as well as
prospective risk management of the potential for LV
and/or aortic root thrombosis must be considered when
exploring specific potential configurations, and must be
assessed prior to implantation.
By providing a range of support options based on the de￾gree of cardiac and respiratory failure (Table 3), ECLS thus
redefines the contemporary management of this condition.
Experimental extracorporeal life support therapies
Several other ECLS cannulation strategies merit consid￾eration and further investigation. These strategies are
necessitated by inherent limitations of ECLS therapies

such as VV ECMO and VA ECMO and also to make
some of the support options less invasive. A summary of
these therapies is presented in Table 4.
Refractory hypoxia and severe pulmonary hypertension
may be encountered on VV ECMO and is often terminal.
Percutaneous transeptal cannulation of the left atrium to
return the oxygenated blood has been proposed as an op￾tion to avoid a sternotomy, which needs to be further in￾vestigated. Similarly, percutaneous transeptal cannulation
of the left atrium for access along with percutaneous right
atrial cannulation may assist in venting the left ventricle
during VA ECMO. Other emerging less invasive ECLS op￾tions include hybrid systems that can provide renal re￾placement therapy and CO2 removal.
Limitations of extracorporeal life support
therapies
ECLS therapies are high-risk invasive interventions under￾taken in a few specialised centres. Despite the advance￾ments in ECLS technology, the associated complications
such as bleeding, thrombosis and infections cannot be
underestimated. Apart from the risk profile, the success of
ECLS relies heavily on its clinical application. Careful se￾lection of both patients and the ECLS perfusion strategy is
the key and not all centres may have the experience or the
resources to provide the full complement of ECLS therap￾ies discussed in this paper.
The lack of robust evidence is a significant limitation.
The complexities in delivering ECLS include resources and
cost-effectiveness, staff training, governance and availability
of funding for other programmes such as cardiothoracic
surgery, long-term mechanical assist devices, and heart and
lung transplantation. Such undertaking may be feasible in
resource-rich settings, but significant innovation and refine￾ment is required prior to its widespread use. With minimal
improvement in outcomes in ARDS over the years, wide￾spread use of VV ECMO and ECCOR may be a reality in
years to come. VA ECMO and its use as a temporary VAD
for MCS is a complex undertaking and its use will probably
be limited to specialised centres.

ECLS therapies hold promise and further research is in￾dicated to explore their full potential. Given the small

number of patients who receive ECLS for cardiac and/or
respiratory support globally, it may not be feasible to
generate evidence-based guidelines for all available ther￾apies. However, ongoing refinements in technology, de￾velopment of minimally invasive techniques, better
understanding of the physiological impact of the ECLS
circuit (for example, altered pharmacokinetics of vital
drugs [62]) and improved clinical delivery may improve
patient outcomes. ECLS therapies will probably play a
vital future role in the management of adult patients
with acute cardiorespiratory failure. Collaboration be￾tween global ECLS centres is the key in designing and
conducting high-quality clinical trials that will hopefully
provide more clarity in patient selection, choice of ECLS
device and the appropriate perfusion strategy to be used.
