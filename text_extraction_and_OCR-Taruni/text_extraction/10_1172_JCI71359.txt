Memory T lymphocytes are commonly viewed as a major barrier for long-term survival of organ allografts and 
are thought to accelerate rejection responses due to their rapid infiltration into allografts, low threshold for 
activation, and ability to produce inflammatory mediators. Because memory T cells are usually associated with 
rejection, preclinical protocols have been developed to target this population in transplant recipients. Here, 
using a murine model, we found that costimulatory blockade–mediated lung allograft acceptance depended on 
the rapid infiltration of the graft by central memory CD8+ T cells (CD44hiCD62LhiCCR7+). Chemokine receptor 
signaling and alloantigen recognition were required for trafficking of these memory T cells to lung allografts. 
Intravital 2-photon imaging revealed that CCR7 expression on CD8+ T cells was critical for formation of stable 
synapses with antigen-presenting cells, resulting in IFN-γ production, which induced NO and downregulated 
alloimmune responses. Thus, we describe a critical role for CD8+ central memory T cells in lung allograft 
acceptance and highlight the need for tailored approaches for tolerance induction in the lung.
Introduction
While transplantation has become an accepted form of therapy 
for end-stage organ failure, formidable immunologic barriers limit 
long-term allograft survival. The currently accepted clinical immu￾nosuppression protocols, consisting of life-long administration 
of calcineurin inhibitors, steroids, and antimetabolites, decrease 
immunosurveillance for both malignancies (1) and infectious 
diseases (2). Perioperative inhibition of lymphocyte activation 
through blockade of costimulatory pathways mediates acceptance 
of several types of allografts in murine models (3–5). Clinical data 
point to the efficacy of costimulatory blockade for the treatment 
of autoimmune diseases in humans (6, 7). Based on these data, 
costimulatory blockade is being actively evaluated in human solid 
organ transplantation (8). This would be very advantageous for 
lung transplantation, in which patients incur higher rates of graft 
loss compared with recipients of other solid organs (9) and suffer 
more infectious complications due to constant exposure of lung 
allografts to the external environment (10, 11).
Alloreactive memory T cells are generated through previous blood 
transfusions, pregnancy, or cross reactivity to viral or environmen￾tal antigens in a process known as heterologous immunity (12). 
When compared with naive T cells, memory T cells have lower acti￾vation requirements and can rapidly trigger alloimmune responses 
through the synthesis of multiple inflammatory cytokines and 
cytolytic effector molecules (12). Furthermore, this cell population 
is relatively resistant to immunosuppression, such as costimulatory 
blockade (13, 14). Multiple studies have established that early infil￾tration of CD8+ memory T cells into allografts, such as hearts, kid￾neys, and livers, facilitates accelerated rejection and presents a bar￾rier to immunosuppression-mediated long-term graft survival (12, 
15–19). Therefore, preclinical studies have focused on targeting this 
cell population in an effort to improve the survival of solid organ 
allografts, such as kidneys (17, 20, 21). However, some reports have 
indicated that CD8+ T cells with phenotypic and functional charac￾teristics of memory cells can also downregulate immune responses. 
While it is well recognized that CD8+ memory T cells express 
CD122, the β subunit of the IL-2 receptor, recent work has shown 
that CD122+-expressing CD8+ T cells can have regulatory capac￾ity (22). CD8+CD122+PD1+ T lymphocytes, for example, suppress 
T cell proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines 
in an IL-10–dependent fashion (22). Another study showed that 
memory-like CD8+ T cells expressing the ectonucleotidase CD38 
suppress CD4+ T cell activation in antigen-independent fashion in 
vitro and attenuate autoimmune responses in vivo (23). Immune 
regulation by these CD8+ T cells was dependent on production of 
IFN-γ and direct contact with the effector CD4+ T cells. Similarly, 
rapid bystander production of IFN-γ by memory CD8+CD44hi
CD62Lhi T cells has been shown to inhibit the development of Th2-
driven allergic airway inflammation (24).
Here, we report that, in contrast to what has been described 
for other organ transplants, early infiltration of CD8+CD44hi
CD62LhiCCR7+ central memory T cells is critical for lung allograft 
acceptance, due to IFN-γ–mediated induction of local NO. Our 
findings identify a novel mechanism of allograft acceptance that 
challenges the currently accepted paradigm of global T cell deple￾tion as induction therapy for lung transplant recipients.
Results
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes can mediate lung allograft rejection. 
Lung allograft rejection is diagnosed and graded based on histo￾logical findings of cellular infiltrates (25). A wide variety of leu￾kocytes, including B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural 
killer cells, have been shown to contribute to rejection of solid 
organs (26–28), and to date it has not been established whether 
T lymphocytes are necessary to mediate lung allograft rejection. To

address this issue, we transplanted BALB/c lungs into allogeneic 
athymic nude mice and determined that, in contrast to wild-type 
recipients (29), these grafts remain ventilated, with little inflam￾mation 1 week after transplantation (Figure 1A) and long term 
(30). We have shown previously that, unlike the case for cardiac 
transplants, lung allografts can be rejected in the absence of CD4+
T cells (31). To test whether CD8+ T cells are essential for the 
rejection of pulmonary allografts, we transplanted BALB/c lungs 
into CD8+ T cell–deficient B6 recipients (referred to herein as B6 
Cd8–/– recipients) and noted histological changes of severe acute 
rejection with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates comparable 
to those seen in CD8+ T cell–sufficient B6 recipients (Figure 1B). 
Immunostaining of these grafts demonstrated extensive infiltra￾tion with CD4+ T cells and no detectable CD8+ T cells (Figure 1C). 
Furthermore, reconstitution of nude mice with CD4+ T cells led 
to rejection of lung allografts by ISHLT A grade (32) (Figure 1D). 
Taken together with previously published data from our labora￾tory (31), we conclude that thymically derived T lymphocytes are 
necessary for lung allograft rejection and that either CD4+ or CD8+
T cells are sufficient to mediate this process.
CD8+ T lymphocytes are critical for lung allograft acceptance. We have 
previously demonstrated that immunosuppression through block￾ade of the CD28/B7 and CD40/CD154 costimulatory pathways 
leads to long-term lung allograft acceptance in the BALB/c→B6 
(31, 33) as well as other strain combinations (30). Regulatory CD4+
T cells have been shown to play a critical role in costimulatory block￾ade–mediated acceptance of heart, skin, and islet allografts as well as 
amelioration of autoimmune diseases (4, 5, 34–38). However, recip￾ient bulk CD4+ T cell antibody-mediated depletion did not affect 
the fate of immunosuppressed lung allografts with rejection grades 
comparable to wild-type costimulatory blockade–treated hosts 
(Figure 2, A and B). While regulatory B cells have been described 
in some models of solid organ transplantation (39), we were still 
able to induce BALB/c lung allograft acceptance in B6 B cell–defi￾cient mice (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available 
online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI71359DS1). Surprisingly, 
pulmonary allografts transplanted into costimulatory blockade–
treated B6 CD8+ T cell–depleted mice (Figure 2C) or B6 Cd8–/– mice 
(Figure 2D) were acutely rejected, with severe graft inflammation. 
The appearances of these grafts and rejection grades were similar 
to what we have reported previously for lungs transplanted into 
nonimmunosuppressed allogeneic recipients (40). Adoptive trans￾fer of wild-type B6 CD8+ T cells into immunosuppressed B6 Cd8–/–
recipients restored acceptance of BALB/c lungs (Figure 2E). Seven 
days after engraftment, we observed an increase in CD4+Foxp3+
T cells in lung allografts of immunosuppressed BALB/c→B6 and 
BALB/c→B6 Cd8–/– recipients compared with lungs from untrans￾planted controls (Figure 3A). However, the proportion of CD4+
T cells expressing Foxp3 in lung allografts was higher in the pres￾ence of CD8+ T cells. No such differences were evident in spleens of

transplanted mice (Supplemental Figure 2). Thus, CD8+ T cells play 
a critical role in mediating lung allograft acceptance.
Based on the finding that CD4+ T cells can trigger lung rejection 
in the absence of CD8+ T cells, we next decided to evaluate CD4+
T lymphocyte responses in the presence or absence of CD8+ T cells. 
We injected CFSE-labeled congenic B6 CD45.1+CD4+ T cells into 
costimulatory blockade–treated B6 wild-type or B6 Cd8–/– recipi￾ent mice at the time of BALB/c lung transplantation and observed 
enhanced proliferation of this cell population in B6 Cd8–/– hosts 
compared with that in B6 wild-type hosts (Figure 3B). We found 
that, after transfer into B6 Cd8–/– recipients, several other costimula￾tory receptors, such as CD27, ICOS, and OX40, were upregulated on 
CD4+ T cells compared with B6 wild-type hosts, while levels of CD28 
and CD154 were comparable in these two groups (Figure 3B). We 
considered the possibility that costimulatory requirements of CD4+
T lymphocytes may be altered in the absence of CD8+ T cells and 
blockade of CD40/CD154 and CD28/B7 pathways may be insuffi￾cient to ameliorate CD4+ T cell–mediated rejection (41). To address 
this, we inhibited CD27/CD70, ICOS/ICOS ligand, and OX40/
OX40 ligand pathways in addition to blocking CD28/B7 and CD40/
CD154 pathways in B6 Cd8–/– recipients of BALB/c lungs. However, 
this treatment regimen did not prevent lung allograft rejection when 
recipients lacked CD8+ T cells (Figure 3C). These findings directly 
contrast with previous observations that depletion or deletion of 
CD8+ T cells prolongs survival of skin and heart allografts when 
recipients are treated with costimulatory blockade (13, 37).
Accepting lung allografts are heavily infiltrated with central memory 
CD8+CD44hiCD62LhiCCR7+ T cells that can downregulate alloimmune 
responses. Costimulatory blockade has been described to mediate 
graft acceptance through the generation of regulatory T lympho￾cytes (4, 5, 34–38). In order to evaluate whether CD8+ T lymphocytes 
with regulatory capacity develop in costimulatory blockade–treated 
lung recipients, we isolated CD8+ T cells from the lung grafts and 
spleens of such mice and used them as “regulators” in in vitro mixed 
lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) (Figure 4A). We found that CD8+
T lymphocytes isolated from accepting BALB/c→B6 lung allo￾grafts, but not spleens of these recipients, inhibited proliferation 
and blasting of B6 CD45.1+CD4+ (Figure 4B) and B6 CD45.1+CD8+
T lymphocytes (Figure 4C) when stimulated with BALB/c spleno￾cytes. These findings suggested that CD8+ T cells with regulatory 
capacity accumulate in accepting lung allografts. While described 
to have regulatory function in other models (42–44), very few 
CD8+IL-10+ or CD8+Foxp3+ cells were detectable in accepting lung 
allografts (Figure 5A). Notably, however, a large portion of CD8+
T cells in accepting grafts had the capacity to produce IFN-γ and 
expressed phenotypic markers consistent with central memory 
T lymphocytes (CD44hiCD62LhiCCR7+) (45). By contrast, most 
CD8+ T cells in the spleens of graft-accepting recipients were naive 
(CD44loCD62Lhi), with lower levels of IFN-γ production (Figure 5B).
While the vast majority of studies suggest that memory T lym￾phocytes potentiate alloimmune responses and inhibit tolerance 
induction (46, 47), it is possible that certain subsets of these cells

may suppress alloreactivity (48). It is noteworthy that CD8+ T 
lymphocytes, including memory CD8+ T cells, were present in the 
lung at baseline, even in the absence of acute inflammation or allo￾antigen stimulation (Figure 6A). This has been attributed to the 
lung’s constant exposure to the environment and need to mount 
rapid responses to pathogens (49). We next set out to investigate 
whether memory CD8+ T cells from lungs of resting mice also 
had regulatory capacity. For this purpose, we flow cytometrically 
sorted CD8+CD44hiCD62Lhi central memory and CD8+CD44hi
CD62Llo effector memory T lymphocytes (45) from resting B6 
mice and used them as regulators in in vitro MLRs, using methods 
similar to those described above (Figure 4A). Interestingly, even 
without prior in vitro stimulation, central memory CD8+ T lym￾phocytes could suppress proliferation of B6 CD45.1+CD4+ T cells 
stimulated with BALB/c splenocytes (Figure 6B), albeit to a lesser 
extent than those derived from transplanted grafts (Figure 4B). 
However, freshly isolated CD8+ effector memory T lymphocytes 
had no effect on B6 CD45.1+CD4+ T cell proliferation (Figure 6B). 
To further evaluate whether different subsets of memory T cells 
could influence the alloimmune response, we generated central 
memory or effector memory CD8+ T cells in vitro by culturing 
B6 splenocytes with irradiated BALB/c stimulators in the pres￾ence of IL-15 or IL-2, respectively, as previously described (50, 51). 
B6 Cd8–/– mice reconstituted with central memory CD8+ T cells 
accepted, while those reconstituted with effector memory CD8+
T cells rejected, BALB/c lung allografts after costimulatory block￾ade (Figure 6, C and D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that 
subtypes of memory CD8+ T cells can differentially influence the 
alloimmune response and that central memory CD8+ T cells play 
a critical role in lung allograft acceptance.
Central memory CD8+ T cells suppress alloimmune responses through 
IFN-γ–mediated production of NO. Since central memory T cells are 
known to be rapid producers of proinflammatory cytokines, we 
next examined whether CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate lung allo￾graft acceptance through secretion of TNF-α or IFN-γ. BALB/c 
lungs were accepted by TNF-α–deficient B6 recipients or B6 
Cd8–/– mice that were reconstituted with TNF-α–deficient B6 
CD8+ T cells (data not shown). By contrast, allograft acceptance 
was abrogated if recipient mice were pretreated with IFN-γ–
neutralizing antibody or Ifng–/– animals were used as hosts (Figure 
Figure 3
CD4+ T lymphocyte responses in CSB-treated lung transplant recipients. (A) The proportion of lung-resident CD4+Foxp3+ T cells is not different in 
resting B6 and B6 Cd8–/– lungs. These numbers do increase, however, after allograft transplantation, and a higher abundance of graft-infiltrating 
CD4+Foxp3+ T cells is detectable in B6 compared with B6 Cd8–/– lung graft recipients (comparison between resting and transplanted lungs by 
ANOVA and comparison between B6 and B6 Cd8–/– groups by unpaired t test). (B) Proliferation of B6 CD4+CD45.1+ T cells was greater after 
injection into B6 Cd8–/– (51.3% ± 5%) than B6 wild-type (20.6% ± 4%) recipients (P = 0.0017 by unpaired t test). Proliferating CD4+CD45.1+
T cells in B6 Cd8–/– recipients upregulated CD27, ICOS, and OX40 but not CD28 or CD154 compared with wild-type mice. Numbers in contour 
plots represent the percentages of adoptively transferred CD4+CD45.1+ T cells that have undergone proliferation (shaded gray, isotype controls; 
black lines, B6 wild-type; red lines, B6 Cd8–/– recipients). (C) Inhibiting CD27/CD70, ICOS/ICOS ligand, and OX40/OX40 ligand in addition to 
blocking CD40/CD154 and CD28/B7 does not prevent rejection in the absence of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.00074 vs. Figure 2A by Mantel-Haenszel 
χ2 test). All gross and histological appearances as well as rejection grades represent grafts at 7 days after transplantation (original magnification, 
×200 [histology, H&E staining]). TXP denotes graft, and the arrow points to perivascular infiltrates.

7A and Supplemental Figure 3). CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression 
of CD4+ T cell proliferation was also abrogated in vitro in the pres￾ence of IFN-γ–neutralizing antibody (Figure 7B). Ifng levels were 
significantly elevated in grafts after transplantation of BALB/c 
lungs into immunosuppressed B6 wild-type recipients compared 
with B6 Cd8–/– recipients (Figure 7C). Finally, injection of Ifng–/–
CD8+ T cells into Cd8–/– mice failed to rescue BALB/c lung allo￾grafts from rejection, despite costimulatory blockade (Figure 7D). 
Taken together, these data demonstrate that IFN-γ production by 
CD8+ T cells plays a critical role in lung allograft acceptance.
In in vitro MLRs described above (Figure 4A), we noted that 
the majority of CD4+CD45.1+ responder T lymphocytes were not

mice (third row). Numbers in histograms represent percentages of (B) CD4+CD45.1+ or (C) CD8+CD45.1+ T cells that have undergone prolifera￾tion. Proliferation and size (forward scatter) in the respective groups are summarized in the bottom panels of B and C, with pair-wise comparison 
between groups performed by t test.

viable as measured by 7-AAD uptake when CD8+ T cells obtained 
from accepting lung allografts were added to the cultures (Figure 
8A). Moreover, sensitivity of antigen-presenting cells to IFN-γ was 
critical for CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression, as proliferation 
of IFN-γ receptor–deficient CD4+ T cells was inhibited by allo￾graft-derived CD8+ T cells, but no inhibition was evident if IFN-γ
receptor–deficient antigen-presenting cells were used (Figure 8B). 
Also, CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression was not observed when 
T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibod￾ies in an antigen-presenting cell–free system (Figure 8C). Taken 
together, these data indicate that CD8+ T cells require antigen￾presenting cells to downregulate T lymphocyte responses and the 
process depends on death of alloreactive cells.
Since metabolism of essential amino acids is a common mech￾anism of immunoregulation by antigen-presenting cells (52), we 
next added various pharmacologic inhibitors to in vitro MLRs 
and noted that only L-NNA (Nω-nitro-L-arginine), an inhibitor of 
endothelial, neuronal, and inducible NO synthase (eNOS, nNOS, 
and iNOS, respectively), and L-nil [N6-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine, 
dihydrochloride], a selective iNOS inhibitor, were able to attenuate 
CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression of CD4+ T lymphocyte prolifer￾ation (Figure 8D). Similarly, iNOS-deficient stimulators also pre￾vented CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression of CD4+ T lymphocyte 
proliferation (Figure 8D). L-norvaline and 1-methyl-tryptophan 
(1-MT), selective inhibitors of arginase and indoleamine-pyrrole 
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), respectively, did not affect proliferation 
of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the addition of L-arginine did not 
reverse CD8+ T cell–mediated suppression, suggesting that amino 
acid depletion was not likely to be the principal method of immu￾noregulation (Figure 8D). This observation is consistent with the 
known role of IFN-γ in inducing iNOS expression (53).
Based on our finding that iNOS is critical to mediate suppres￾sion by CD8+ T cells and reports showing that local production of 
NO can downregulate immune responses by limiting proliferation 
and survival of T lymphocytes (54), we next set out to directly mea￾sure NO production in lungs. A near doubling in NO levels was evi￾dent in accepting BALB/c→B6 lung grafts compared with unma￾nipulated lungs of resting mice (Figure 8E). By contrast, we did not 
observe increases in NO levels in BALB/c→B6 Cd8–/– grafts. NO 
levels in the right native lungs of BALB/c→B6 and BALB/c→B6 
Cd8–/– transplant recipients were comparable to resting lungs. To 
further examine the role of NO in graft acceptance, we next trans￾planted BALB/c lungs into costimulatory blockade–treated recip￾ient B6 mice deficient in iNOS and observed that these grafts were 
rejected (Figure 8F). Thus, lung transplant acceptance is depen￾dent on NO production by graft-infiltrating recipient cells.
Gαi-coupled chemokine receptors regulate trafficking of alloantigen￾specific CD8+ central memory T cells into lung allografts. We next set out 
to characterize further the behavior of CD8+ central memory T cells 
in immunosuppressed lung graft recipients. We observed that cen￾tral memory CD8+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated grafts in costim￾ulatory blockade–treated hosts have undergone proliferation, 
albeit to a lesser degree than in nonimmunosuppressed recipients 
(Supplemental Figure 4). To investigate their trafficking require￾ments, we generated donor-specific (anti-BALB/c) central memory 
CD45.1+CD8+ T cells in vitro and treated a portion of these cells 
with pertussis toxin (PTX), which irreversibly inactivates Gαi-cou￾pled chemokine receptor signaling. PTX-treated or untreated cen￾tral memory CD8+ T cells were injected into immunosuppressed B6 
recipients of BALB/c lungs and analyzed by flow cytometry 2 days 
later. We found that PTX treatment significantly impairs migra￾tion of donor-specific central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes into 
lung allograft tissue (Figure 9A). By contrast, PTX treatment did 
not alter trafficking of third-party–specific (anti-CBA/Ca) central 
memory CD8+ T cells into BALB/c allografts. Furthermore, com￾pared with donor-specific cells, significantly fewer third-party–
specific central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrated BALB/c 
lung allograft tissue (Figure 9A). This was not due to a global 
defect in cell migration, as similar numbers of anti-BALB/c and 
anti-CBA/Ca CD45.1+ B6 central memory CD8+ T cells infiltrated

capacity to produce IFN-γ and expressed a central memory phenotype (CD44hiCD62LhiCCR7+). (B) Fewer cells in spleens of lung graft recipients 
had the capacity to produce IFN-γ, and only few cells had a central memory T cell phenotype. Numbers in density plots in A and B represent 
percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing indicated markers. Phenotype of CD8+ T cells is representative of at least 4 separate experiments.

spleens of lung graft recipients (Supplemental Figure 5). Similar to 
central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes, graft infiltration of in vitro–
generated anti-BALB/c CD8+ effector memory T cells was impaired 
after PTX treatment (Figure 9A). However, the absolute number of 
anti-donor effector memory T cells accumulating in the lung was 
significantly lower than that of anti-donor central memory T cells 
(Figure 9A). Collectively, these data suggest that chemokine recep￾tor signaling as well as alloantigen recognition play a role in graft 
infiltration by CD8+ central memory T lymphocytes.
CCR7 expression on CD8+ T cells is critical for lung allograft accep￾tance. As the expression of the Gαi-coupled chemokine receptor 
C-C chemokine receptor type 7+ (CCR7+) is a hallmark of cen￾tral memory T cells, and a large portion of CD8+CD44hiCD62Lhi
T cells in accepting lung allografts express CCR7 (Figure 5A), we 
next explored whether this specific chemokine receptor plays a 
role in graft acceptance. We first transplanted BALB/c lungs into 
immunosuppressed CCR7-deficient recipients and observed that 
these grafts were acutely rejected (Supplemental Figure 6). As sev￾eral cell populations in addition to T cells can express CCR7, we 
next focused on T lymphocytes by adoptively transferring B6 CCR7-
deficient CD8+ T lymphocytes into costimulatory blockade–treated 
B6 Cd8–/– recipients of BALB/c lungs. Unlike immunosuppressed 
Cd8–/– recipients reconstituted with wild-type CD8+ T lymphocytes 
(Figure 2E), those reconstituted with Ccr7–/– CD8+ T cells acutely 
rejected BALB/c allografts (Figure 9B). This demonstrates that 
CCR7 expression on recipient CD8 T cells plays a critical role in 
mediating lung allograft acceptance. Having demonstrated that 
IFN-γ production by recipient CD8+ T cells is essential for lung 
allograft acceptance, we examined whether CCR7 expression on 
CD8 T cells regulates the production of this cytokine. Indeed, we 
found that local expression of Ifng was significantly decreased when 
graft-infiltrating CD8 T cells lacked CCR7 (Figure 9C).
We have shown previously that graft-infiltrating recipient 
CD11c+ cells in rejecting lung allografts express both donor and 
self–MHC class II molecules on their surface and can activate CD4+
T cells via both direct and indirect allorecognition (55). Similarly, 
graft-infiltrating recipient CD11c+ dendritic cells in accepting 
lungs express both donor and recipient MHC class I molecules (Fig￾ure 9D), suggesting that recipient dendritic cells can contribute to 
the activation of alloreactive CD8+ T cells through both direct and 
indirect pathways of alloantigen presentation (56). Furthermore, 
this cell population has been shown to express CCL21, a ligand 
for CCR7, on its surface (57). To further evaluate the role of CCR7 
expression on CD8+ T cells, we took advantage of our recently

Central memory CD8+ T cells are abundant in the lung and can suppress alloimmune responses both in vitro and in vivo. (A) Compared with 
other solid organs, such as heart, kidney, and pancreas, the lung contains a relative abundance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, including central memory 
cells. Central memory (CM) cells are defined as CD44hi62Lhi, effector memory (EM) cells are defined as CD44hi62Llo, and naive cells are defined 
as CD44lo62Lhi. Data is representative of 4 separate animals. (B) Freshly isolated central memory CD8+ T cells from resting B6 mice suppress 
proliferation of B6 CD4+CD45.1+ T cells stimulated with BALB/c splenocytes using methodology similar to that described in Figure 4A. Pair-wise

and central memory CD8+ T cells was performed by unpaired t test. (C) Adoptive transfer of in vitro–generated B6 anti-BALB/c central memory

described method to image murine lungs by 2-photon micros￾copy in vivo (58). We transplanted BALB/c lungs into immuno￾suppressed B6 CD11c-EYFP hosts, which express enhanced yellow 
fluorescent protein under a CD11c promoter, and injected fluo￾rescently labeled B6 CD8+ wild-type and Ccr7–/– T cells 3 days after 
engraftment. When we imaged these lung grafts 24 hours later, 
we observed that wild-type CD8+ T lymphocytes made stable and 
long-lasting contacts with graft-infiltrating recipient CD11c+ cells. 
By contrast, in the absence of CCR7 expression, CD8+ T cells inter￾acted with CD11c+ dendritic cells only briefly, with significantly 
shorter retention times (P < 0.001) (Figure 10 and Supplemental 
Video 1). Collectively, these findings suggest that, in addition to 
directing trafficking of T lymphocytes into the lung, chemokine 
receptor signaling regulates contact between graft-infiltrating 
CD8+ T cells and alloantigen-expressing cells, which is associated 
with decreased local production of IFN-γ and graft rejection.
Discussion
The overwhelming success of costimulation blockade (CSB) in 
extending graft survival in small animal models of organ transplan￾tation has laid the foundation for translating this therapy to the 
clinics (59). However, kidney transplantation experiments in non￾human primates demonstrated that alloreactive memory T cells, 
generated through heterologous immunity, may represent a barrier 
to long-term graft survival in animals raised outside the confines of 
specific pathogen–free conditions (60, 61). This has been suspected 
to be especially problematic in recipients with a high frequency of 
CD8+ memory T cells, due to rapid graft infiltration by this cell 
population (13, 15). Based on these observations, strategies have 
been developed to either globally deplete T lymphocytes during 
the perioperative period (62) or specifically target memory T cells 
(21). We have previously reported that treatment of lung allograft 
recipients with CTLA4-Ig alone does not prevent acute rejection 
regardless of presence of CD4+ T cells (31). Additional treatment 
with anti-CD154 prevents rejection after transplantation of lungs 
into wild-type or even CD4+ T cell–depleted allogeneic hosts, pos￾sibly due to transient expression of this costimulatory molecule on 
CD8+ T lymphocytes or other cells (13, 63).
The unique features of the lung, such as the rapidity and local 
initiation of the immune response, have allowed us to unravel a 
previously unrecognized and critical role for CD8+CD44hiCD62Lhi
CCR7+ T cells in the induction of graft acceptance. We and oth￾ers have shown that lungs provide a suitable environment for the 
activation of adaptive immunity in the absence of secondary lym￾phoid organs (64–66). Our recent studies have demonstrated that 
innate and adaptive immune cells rapidly infiltrate lung grafts and 
that their interactions within the graft determine the fate of this 
organ (58, 67). Of particular relevance to the current findings, we 
have shown recently that immune responses contributing to lung 
allograft acceptance are established locally in the graft shortly 
after transplantation (30), while other tissue and organ grafts 
require the presence of secondary lymphoid organs for the initia￾Figure 7

tion as well as downregulation of alloimmune responses (68–70). 
Our findings, with regard to trafficking requirements of CD8+
T cells to pulmonary allografts, further extend the notion that 
lungs differ immunologically from other transplanted organs. It 
has been demonstrated recently that antigen recognition regulates 
trafficking of effector CD8+ T cells into murine heart grafts (71). 
Consistent with these data, we now demonstrate that in vitro–
generated central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrate lung 
allografts to a significantly larger extent compared with anti–third 
party central memory CD8+ T cells. However, in direct contrast to 
Figure 8
CD8+ T cells suppress through IFN-γ–mediated production of NO. (A) After 5 days, the majority of CD4+CD45.1+ T cell “responders” are not viable

heart allografts, we now demonstrate that Gα1 receptor signaling 
is also critical for donor-primed CD8+ effector and central mem￾ory T cell infiltration into lung grafts. Our findings extend recent 
reports that chemokine receptor expression on T cells regulates 
their homing to virally infected lungs (72). We thus show that both 
alloantigen- and Gα1-dependent chemokine signaling play a role 
in memory T lymphocyte migration into lungs.
Since their description almost 2 decades ago (73), the majority 
of studies investigating mechanisms of immune regulation have 
focused on CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (69). Despite experimen￾tal evidence dating back to the 1970s that CD8+ T cells can suppress 
immune responses, only recently has this cell population experi￾enced a resurgence in the literature. This is in large part due to the 
phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ T cells with suppressive function. 
To this end, CD8+ T cells with both naive and memory phenotypes 
have been described to have regulatory capacity. Expansion of naive 
human CD8+CCR7+ T cells with low-dose anti-CD3 and IL-15 
induces their expression of Foxp3, CD25, and CD103 and their 
ability to suppress activation of CD4+ T cells (74). In mice, CD8+
Foxp3+ T cells can regulate skin alloimmune responses in a con￾tact-dependent fashion (43), and a similar population of cells that 
relies on direct interaction with CD4+ T cell responders has been 
described in humans (74). In rats, a regulatory CD8+Foxp3+CTLA4+
CD45RClo population has been described; however, controversy 
exists as to whether these cells suppress via production of cytokines 
or cell-to-cell contact (42, 75). Reports that CD8+ T cells can sup￾press through TGF-β also exist (48, 76). In contrast to these reports, 
we now describe an IFN-γ–dependent mechanism of CD8+CCR7+
T cell–mediated immunosuppression in the murine lung.
CCR7 expression is a hallmark of central memory T cells and reg￾ulates their homing to lymph nodes. Investigations into the role of 
CCR7 in transplant rejection have yielded conflicting results, which 
may be in part due to this molecule regulating migration and func￾tion of multiple cell populations. Hearts and skin experienced a 
moderate prolongation in survival after transplantation into Ccr7–/–
recipients, which is associated with reduced T cell graft infiltration 
(77). Interrupting CCR7 signaling has been shown to enhance allo￾graft survival through reduction of Th1 responses (78). Detrimental 
effects of recipient CCR7 deficiency on graft survival, on the other 
hand, have been attributed to decreased trafficking of tolerogenic 
antigen-presenting cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, into 
draining lymph nodes (79) or CD4+Foxp3+ T cells into grafts (80).

due to ischemia/reperfusion injury abrogates immunosuppression￾mediated lung graft acceptance (67). However, the absence of IFN-γ
can also have deleterious effects on graft survival. Cardiac allografts 
undergo necrosis in the absence of recipient IFN-γ despite immu￾nosuppression, which has been attributed to inefficient deletion of 
activated T lymphocytes (85). Activation of alternative pathways, 
such as the Th17 differentiation pathway, may also mediate aggres￾sive proinflammatory responses in the absence of IFN-γ (86, 87).
As memory T lymphocytes in peripheral organs provide a first 
line of defense against infection, mucosal barrier organs, such 
as the lung, are especially rich in this cell population (88, 89). In 
fact, independent of antigen or inflammation, memory T cells are 
retained in lungs, in which they are rapid producers of proinflam￾matory cytokines (89, 90). As uncontrolled inflammatory responses 
in the lung can result in potentially life-threatening pulmonary dys￾function, mechanisms have evolved that limit the extent of inflam￾mation to prevent tissue damage (91). For example, iNOS limits 
pulmonary inflammation in several models of lung injury (92, 
93). Thus, it is possible that our costimulatory blockade protocol 
relies on a naturally occurring IFN-γ– and NO-dependent “feedback 
mechanism” normally operational in the lung. In contrast to central 
memory CD8+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells do not promote 
Here, we report that CCR7-expressing CD8+ T cells are critical for 
lung allograft acceptance. Mechanistically, we show by intravital 
2-photon microscopy that, in the absence of CCR7, CD8+ T cells are 
unable to form durable interactions with antigen-presenting cells 
within the graft, which is associated with lower expression of IFN-γ. 
These findings extend previous reports showing that dendritic cells 
express CCL21 and that surface-bound CCR7 ligands induce tether￾ing of T lymphocytes to antigen-presenting cells during the forma￾tion of stable synapses (81, 82). It has also been shown that dendritic 
cells bind more CCR7 ligands on their surface than other cell popu￾lations (57). Previous reports have pointed to a role of CCR7 ligands 
in T cell differentiation. Stimulation of dendritic cells with CCR7 
ligands induces their production of IL-12 and IL-23, which can drive 
Th1 and Th17 differentiation, respectively (83). Consistent with our 
findings, others have also observed that CCR7 expression on T cells 
is critical to mount an IFN-γ–dependent immune response that is 
required to clear pathogens (84).
Traditionally, Th1 responses have been considered to be instru￾mental in promoting cell-mediated rejection. We have described an 
accumulation of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in nonim￾munosuppressed lung allografts that undergo acute rejection (31). 
Perhaps more importantly, excessive activation of Th1 responses

tral memory cells 48 to 72 hours prior to BALB/c lung allograft transplan￾tation. For some experiments, memory cells were treated with 200 ng/ml 
PTX for 30 minutes prior to injection. For homing studies, lung grafts were 
flushed with 2.5 ml sterile saline prior to analysis
Histology. Transplanted mouse lungs were fixed in formaldehyde, sec￾tioned, and stained with H&E. A lung pathologist (J.H. Ritter) blinded to 
the experimental conditions graded graft rejection using standard crite￾ria (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [ISHLT] 
A Grade) developed by the Lung Rejection Study Group (32).
Flow cytometry. All antibodies for flow cytometry were primarily fluo￾rochrome conjugated and purchased from eBioscience. Intracellular stain￾ing was performed as previously described (31).
In vitro MLRs. In vitro MLRs were performed in round bottom 96-well 
plates using 3 × 105 T cell–depleted BALB/c splenocyte stimulators, with 
105 CFSE-labeled B6 CD45.1+CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responders and, as indi￾cated above, 105 CD8+ T cells isolated from lungs or spleens of immuno￾suppressed B6 recipients of BALB/c allografts. For some experiments, cen￾tral and effector memory T cells were sorted from lungs of resting mice. 
T cell responses were evaluated flow cytometrically on day 5. All compounds 
inhibiting the metabolism of essential amino acids were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich and added to the cocultures as previously described for the 
duration of the experiment (41).
Quantitative gene expression analysis. For quantitative gene expression analy￾sis, mRNA from whole lung grafts was isolated in accordance with the man￾ufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted on 
an ABI 7900 using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay system (Applied Biosys￾tems) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Amplifica￾tion of target sequences was conducted as follows: 50°C for 20 minutes and 
95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 38 to 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 
60°C for 1 minute. Primers and MGB probes were purchased as kits from 
Applied Biosystems and can be identified in the following manner: IFN-γ
(Mm01168134_m1) and β-2 microglobulin (Mm00437762_m1). Transcript 
levels of IFN-γ are expressed relative to transcript levels of β-2 microglobulin.
NO measurement in vivo. In vivo experiments were carried out using a 2 mm 
NO Sensor (World Precision Instruments) connected to a Free Radical Ana￾lyzer TBR-1025 (World Precision Instruments). The specifications include 
a 2 pA/nM sensitivity with a 1 nM minimum detection limit. Prior to the 
experiments, the sensor was polarized for at least 24 hours before use accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After sedating the mouse, a 
2 mm long and 1 mm deep incision was made in the lung tissue to provide an 
area for the sensor to rest in. Approximately 0.5 ml saline was applied to the 
incision in order to provide an interface between the mouse lung and sensor 
and also to monitor the integrity of the sensor’s NO-selective membrane. 
The data from each lung were recorded using a LabTrax data acquisition 
unit and LabScribe software for 5 minutes after reaching a stable signal. 
The data were then analyzed against a baseline signal from normal saline 
and converted from current to NO concentration in ppm using NO donor 
DEA-Nonoate (Cayman Chemical) dissolved in PBS buffer as a standard.
Immunostaining. Lungs were cryopreserved and then cut into 6-μm-thick 
sections. Sections were fixed in pure acetone for 10 minutes at –20°C and 
blocked with 10% normal donkey serum. Unlabeled anti-CD4 (H129.19) 
and anti-CD8 (53-6.7) (Pharmingen) were visualized using donkey anti-rat 
IgG conjugated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3) (Roche). Slides were imaged 
using an Olympus BX51 microscope. No detectable staining was observed 
with isotype-matched or species-specific control antibodies.
Intravital 2-photon microscopy. BALB/c lungs were transplanted into immu￾nosuppressed B6 CD11c-EYFP recipients and, on postoperative day 3, 
received an injection of 107 CMTMR-labeled Ccr7–/– and 107 CD8+ T cells 
isolated from wild-type B6 mice expressing cyan fluorescent protein under 
an actin promoter. Twenty-four hours after injection of T cells, time-lapse 
lung allograft acceptance and are associated with graft rejection. 
Our findings support the notion that these 2 cell populations are 
functionally distinct (45). CCR7– effector memory T cells rapidly 
infiltrate peripheral tissues during inflammation and are rich in 
effector molecules, such as granzyme B, and surface killer cell lect￾in-like receptor family members, such as KLRG1 (94, 95). CCR7+
central memory T cells, however, have been traditionally described 
to reside in secondary lymphoid tissue and mediate delayed effector 
function through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as 
IFN-γ (50). Thus, it is possible that the unique physiology of the 
lung, which is enriched in central memory cells compared with 
other organs, relies on cytokine production by this cell population 
to downregulate immune responses. Since central memory CD8+
T cells that infiltrate accepting lung allografts have undergone 
proliferation, we speculate that expansion of this cell population is 
needed to prevent rejection.
Our findings provide an impetus to critically evaluate current 
immunosuppressive strategies used in clinical lung transplantation, 
as many of them actually inhibit the pathways that we have identi￾fied as necessary for lung transplant acceptance. Examples include 
global T cell depletion, which would eliminate central memory CD8 
T cells; mycophenolic acid, which inhibits early Th1 responses (96); 
and calcineurin inhibitors, which have been shown to suppress 
iNOS (97). New approaches, such as ex vivo lung perfusion, have 
the potential to test these findings in preclinical models (98).
Methods
Animals. Wild-type, Ifng–/–, Ifngr1–/–, Ccr7–/–, Cd8–/–, Inos–/–, Tnfa–/–, CD11c-EYFP, 
CD45.1+, and B cell–deficient (Ighm–/–) mice, all on a B6 (H-2Kb) background, 
as well as BALB/c (H-2Kd), CBA/Ca (H2Kk), and nude mice were purchased 
from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed in a barrier facility in air￾filtered cages. Left orthotopic vascularized lung transplants were performed 
as previously described (40) with CSB in select experiments consisting of MR1 
(250 μg i.p., day 0) and CTLA4-Ig (200 μg i.p., day 2). As indicated for select 
experiments, CD8+ T cells were depleted in vivo by YTS 169.1 (250 μg i.p., days 
–3, –1), IFN-γ was neutralized using hamster anti-mouse anti–IFN-γ antibody 
(clone H22) (500 g day –2, 250 μg i.p. day –1), and CD4+ T cells were depleted 
using GK1.5 (100 μg i.p., days –3, –1). For select experiments, OX40/OX40 
ligand (clone OX-86), CD27/CD70 (clone FR-70), and ICOS/ICOS ligand 
(clone 17G9) pathways were inhibited as previously described (all antibod￾ies from BioXcell) (41). For some experiments, nude mice were reconstituted 
with 107 CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleens and peripheral lymph nodes 
of B6 wild-type mice and, for others, CFSE-labeled CD4+CD45.1+ T cells were 
adoptively transferred into B6 mice. Reconstitution of B6 Cd8–/– mice was 
performed with a minimum of 5 × 106 CD8+ T cells isolated either by flow 
cytometric sorting or magnetic bead isolation (Miltenyi Biotech).
Memory cell generation and injection. Both central and effector memory 
CD8+ T cells were generated in vitro based on previously described meth￾ods (50, 51). Briefly, central memory cells were generated by coculturing 
B6 CD45.1+ splenocytes with irradiated BALB/c (donor) or CBA/Ca (third 
party) splenocyte stimulators. Sixty hours after initiation of the cocultures 
dead cells were removed by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation and CD8+
T cells were positively selected with magnetic beads. CD8+ T cells were then 
expanded in 20 ng/ml IL-15 (R&D Systems) and injected intravenously 
approximately 2 weeks later. Effector memory cells were generated by 
coculturing B6 CD45.1+ splenocytes with irradiated BALB/c stimulators in 
the presence of 1,000 U/ml IL-2 (NIH NCI-Clinical Repository). For hom￾ing studies, 5 × 106 effector memory cells and 1 × 106 central memory cells 
were injected per mouse 2 to 3 days after transplantation. For reconstitu￾tion experiments, B6 Cd8–/– mice were injected with 5 × 106 effector or cen-

imaging was performed with a custom-built 2-photon microscope running 
ImageWarp version 2.1 acquisition software (A&B Software). For time￾lapse imaging of T cell–CD11c+ dendritic cell interactions in lung tissue, 
we averaged 15 video-rate frames (0.5 seconds per slice) during the acqui￾sition to match the ventilator rate and to minimize movement artifacts. 
Each plane represents an image of 220 × 240 μm in the x and y dimensions. 
Twenty-one sequential planes were acquired in the z dimension (2.5 μm 
each) to form a z stack. Each individual T cell was tracked from its first 
appearance in the imaging window and followed up to the time point at 
which it dislocated more than 20 μm from its starting position. T cells that 
did not travel were tracked for the duration of the imaging period.
Statistics. Continuous variables, such as in vitro and in vivo T cell prolifer￾ation, gene expression levels, retention times of T cells, number of memory 
T cells penetrating lung grafts, and NO levels, were compared among vari￾ous conditions. Two-tailed Student’s t test was used for 2 comparisons and 
ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons, as indicated in the appropriate 
figure legends. For ordinal variables, such as lung allograft rejection scores,
