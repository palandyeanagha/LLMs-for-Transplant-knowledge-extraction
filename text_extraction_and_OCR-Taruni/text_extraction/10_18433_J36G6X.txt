ABSTRACT – Purpose. Herbal medicines have been increasingly used worldwide. However, the potential 
harms of these herbs have been noticed most recently following hepatotoxicity with ingestion of herbal 
remedies. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence of hepatotoxic effects linked to use of herbal 
preparations. Method. Electronic search was performed by searching several databases: PubMed, HerbMed, 
Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Library using both Latin 
and common names of several herbs. Language was restricted to English and articles were selected for 
relevance reporting incidence of hepatotoxicity associated with use of herbal products in human. Results.
From a total of 565 relevant reviews and articles, 254 met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Serious 
hepatotoxic events associated with various herbal products alone or in combination with other drugs have 
been reported. Linking to herbal constituents the spectrum of liver toxicity includes elevated liver enzymes, 
acute or chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, hepatic necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, as well as acute liver failure 
and hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Conclusion. The hepatotoxicity of herbs was extensively 
acknowledged. As the use of natural medicine increases, the risk of liver toxicity and drug interaction 
increase as well. Accordingly, herbal remedies have been known as hepatotoxins causing several liver 
damages. Further scientific studies with high and good quality are needed to identify toxic compounds and 
understand the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity-induced by herbs. The adverse effects of herbal products 
must be fully reported as well as extensive education of healthcare providers must be provided in order to 
reduce danger of alternative medicines.

INTRODUCTION 
The use of alternative medicine or phytotherapy 
can be traced back in old manuscripts coming 
from ancient China, India, Iran, Korea and Egypt. 
During the past several decades, the use of herbal 
medicines has been expanded and gained more 
attention due to their therapeutic potentials (1,2). 
Certain factors contributed to the increasing use 
of herbal medicine including effectiveness, 
availability, affordability, and, apparently, safety 
(3). It has been estimated that over 500 herbal 
products are distributed as harmless healthy 
products worldwide (4). As compared to 
conventional therapy, natural therapy is believed 
to be free of side effects (5).
Liver is the largest and most vital organ in 
human body and able to detoxify several chemical 
compounds (6). The occurrence of liver toxicity 
cases linked to herbal medicine raises some 
concerns regarding herbal safety (7,8,9). 
According to two reviews, several case reports 
reported severe hepatic damage associated with 
botanicals alone or in combination with other 
medications (7,10). The toxicity of herbs is 
probably due to several factors such as plant 
component that has been used, storage conditions 
of plant, mislabeling or misidentification of plant, 
and contaminations (11). Recently, different 
hepatic reactions involving botanicals have been 
documented (12). The spectrum of liver toxicity 
includes elevated liver enzymes, acute or chronic 
hepatitis, cholestasis, hepatic necrosis or fibrosis, 
cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatic veno-occlusive 
disease (12,13). Some of botanicals that raised 
severe health concerns are Black cohosh (14), 
Chaparral (15), Saw palmetto (16), Comfrey (8), 
Germander (17) Kava (18) and many others as 
described in this review.
The purpose of this paper is to review already 
published cases and spontaneous reports of the 
hepatotoxicity of each botanical and systemically 
assess the evidence of hepatotoxic events 
associated with these herbs as well as providing 
botanical names, synonyms, active constituents, _________________________________________________

potential herb-herb interaction or herb-drug 
interaction and possible mechanisms of toxicity.
METHODS 
We reviewed scientific articles that were obtained 
from PubMed, HerbMed, Scopus, Google 
Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews and Cochrane Library databases between 
1900 and 2013. We used the following search 
terms: herbal hepatotoxicity, hepatotoxic plants, 
liver toxicity, botanicals hepatotoxicity, toxic 
hepatitis, herbal remedies, alternative medicine, 
complementary therapy as well as the common
and Latin name of botanicals. The search was 
restricted to English language articles and Human 
studies only. 
RESULTS
The search generated 565 relevant papers, of 
which 310 were excluded as shown in Figure 1. A 
list of herbs with hepatotoxic effects is shown in 
Table 1. Our search identified cases that provided 
evidence of hepatotoxicity of certain herbs. In 
addition, we indicated whether medicinal 
botanicals were alone or combined with other 
drugs implicated in several hepatotoxic incidents. 
Moreover, several possible mechanisms of herbs 
causing hepatotoxicity appear to be involved and 
are summarized in Table 1. In some case reports 
we did not find enough scientific documentation 
and limited information of several herbs was 
provided. However, we combined the knowledge 
derived from phytotherapy and liver metabolism 
to provide a unique comprehensive guide for 
pharmacologists and pharmaceutical scientists.
Black cohosh (Actea racemosa):
Actea racemosa is a perennial, woodland herb 
with a thick root system (rhizome) that belongs to 
Ranunculaceae family and is native to North 
America (Figure 2A) (19). Cimicifuga racemosa
is one synonym of this plant and other names 
include black coach, black snakeroot, rattleroot,
bugwort, macrotys and bugbane (20). The root of 
black cohosh has been used by Native American 
Indians for treating several conditions like colds, 
coughs, fatigue, and constipation (21). In 
particular, cimicifuga rhizomes have been used as 
treatment for menopause-related symptoms, 
rheumatism, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual 
discomfort (21,22).

The main active constituent of black cohosh 
rhizome is terpene glycosides like actein, 
cimicifugoside and 27-deoxyactein as well as 
some other active constituents like alkaloids, 
flavonoids and tannins (23). Several studies have 
been conducted to determine the safety of black 
cohosh. Some of these studies suggested that 
Cimicifuga extract causes severe acute hepatitis 
and liver failure and autoimmune mechanism has 
been proposed (14,24,25). In fact, Cohen et al. 
(25) reported the first case of autoimmune 
hepatitis associated with the use of black cohosh 
in a 57-year-old woman without history of liver 
disease. She started to use black cohosh to treat 
“hot flashes”, but she developed autoimmune 
hepatitis. Another case report mentions a 
relationship between the use of cimicifuga and 
acute hepatitis (14). A 47-year-old woman with no 
history of liver disease took black cohosh for one 
week with no other medication to treat 
menopause symptoms. Severe hepatitis and 
jaundice developed following ingestion leading to 
liver transplant. In the report by Levitsky et al. 
(24), a 50-year-old woman had black cohosh root 
daily as a medication for menopause symptoms. 
The patient was admitted to the hospital for liver 
transplantation due to development of acute 
fulminant hepatitis with diffuse cell necrosis and 
cholestasis.

(Actaea Racemosa) (26)
Chaparral (Larrea tridentata):
Chaparral is an evergreen desert shrub, which is 
made of leaves of greasewood or creosote bush 
(Figure 2B). It is native to the southwestern 
United States and Mexico (15,27). Larrea 
tridentate is the botanical name of chaparral and 
other synonyms include L. glutinosa Engelm and 
L. divaricata Cav. (28). Ancient Native Americans 
have used chaparral as tea to treat rheumatic pain 
and bronchitis. It also has been used in different 
forms like capsules and tablets for the treatment 
of other conditions such as diarrhea, cold, 
rheumatism, urinary tract infection, and chronic 
skin diseases (29,30). Among herbs, chaparral is 
probably the best known antibiotic treatment 
derived from plants (31). Nordihydroguaiaretic 
acid (NDGA) has been proposed as the active 
constituent of chaparral. NDGA is an antioxidant 
and an inhibitor of two biochemical pathways 
involving cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase 
(28,31). Some of reported side effects of chaparral 
include: vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fever, and 
abdominal cramp (28). Hepatotoxicity is the 
major problem linked to chaparral ingestion (32). 
A review done by Sheikh et al. (15) reviewed 18 
cases of illnesses following chaparral ingestion. 
The age range of 13 patients was 25-60 and 
jaundice was the main sign of liver disease. Liver 
injury also included cholestatic hepatitis, 
fulminant liver failure, and rash progression to 
cirrhosis. In a 22 years old woman, the
hepatotoxicity developed during the breast￾feeding period following delivery of a healthy 
newborn and ingestion of chaparral to increase 
milk secretion (31). Her liver biopsy and lab 
findings confirmed the diagnosis of acute drug￾induced hepatitis as well as hepatic fibrosis. 
Another report of a male individual of 27 years of 
age developed hepatitis after 12 month of taking 
chaparral to prevent illness (28). 
Figure 2: Hepatotoxic Plant (B) Chaparral (Larrea 
tridentata) (33)
Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens): 
Serenoa repens (S. repens), commonly known as 
saw palmetto or scrub palmetto, is the most 
common herb used for treatment of symptoms of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and urinary 
tract infection (UTI) (34). It is a dried ripe fruit of 
American dwarf palm tree that is native to West 
Indies and South-eastern America. It is also 
known as Sabal serrulata and Serenoa serrulata 
(botanical names) (Figure 2C) (35,36). The 
preparation of saw palmetto is called prostata and 
it is composed of fatty acids and phytosterols 
(37). The most active ingredients of saw palmetto 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
379
are steroidal and sitosterol compounds (35). 
Furthermore, saw palmetto has estrogenic and 
antiandrogenic properties (38). Obviously, both 
estrogen and antiandrogen can be hepatotoxic. In 
fact, high levels of estrogen are associated with 
cholestatic effects and antiandrogen effects 
include fulminant hepatitis (39,40). Few studies 
and case reports have reported some toxicity of S. 
repens. A case report reported the association 
between prostata and protracted cholestatic 
hepatitis in 65-year-old man taking this herbal 
preparation to treat nocturia and hesitancy (39). 
Additionally, Lapi et al. (41) reported a case of 
acute liver damage associated with saw palmetto. 
A 58-year-old man consumed a commercially 
available S. repens (2 capsules/day) as a treatment 
of BPH. He was previously diagnosed with 
Gilbert’s syndrome, the most common hereditary 
cause of increased bilirubin present in 5-10% of 
the population due to reduced activity of the 
enzyme glucuronyltransferase, which conjugates 
bilirubin and some other lipophilic molecules. 
Gilbert's syndrome produces an elevated 
hematologic level of unconjugated bilirubin but 
normally has no serious consequences. After 
taking S. repens, the patient was diagnosed acute 
liver injury. According to other case reports, saw 
palmetto was linked to pancreatitis as well. In 
2006, Jibrin et al. (16) reported a case of 55-year￾old man who had saw palmetto for four years for 
BPH. He presented with severe epigastric pain, 
vomiting, and nausea. The patient was diagnosed 
with both acute hepatitis and pancreatitis due to 
saw palmetto. Bruminhent et al. (36), reported 
another case of acute pancreatitis following 
exposure to S. repens. A 61-year-old man with 
previous history of BPH and gastro-esophageal 
reflux disease developed acute pancreatitis 
resulting from saw palmetto ingestion with other 
drugs.

(Serenoa repens) (42)
Comfrey (Symphytum officinale L.):
Comfrey is a common garden plant that belongs
to Boraginaceae family (43). There are several 
species that belong to Symphytum genus, which 
includes S. officinale L. (comfrey), S. asperum 
Lepech, S. caucasicum Bieb, S. tuberosum L. and
S. x uplandicum Nyman (43,8). The most 
commonly used species is S. officinale L. or 
comfrey, which is a long perennial plant that is 
made of small flowers that are purple in color and 
large hairy leaves (44,45) (Figure 2D). For more 
than 2000 years, comfrey leaves and roots have 
been used as medicinal herb (46). Additionally, 
comfrey has been consumed as tea and vegetable 
for the treatment of various diseases including 
bone fractures, wound healing, inflammation of 
joints, and thrombophlebitis (47,48). The major 
content of comfrey is pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), 
which is presented in higher concentration in 
roots than in leaves (49). Several studies reported 
health risk associated with PA. The major 
hepatotoxic effect of PA is the hepatic veno￾occlusive disease (VOD) (50,51) that is also 
known as Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (52). 
Portal hypertension with severe ascites is one of 
major characteristics of VOD disease (53). 
Epidemics of VOD were reported several decades 
ago in South Africa, Jamaica and India and 
Afghanistan (8). In a case report previously 
published by one of the authors (CS), bush tea 
containing pyrrolizidin alkaloids was consumed 
by the mother of a baby who presented at 
neonatal age with VOD and liver failure (54). 
This was the youngest patient with VOD ever 
described in the literature. Many case reports 
confirm indeed the toxicity associated with 
comfrey consumption. The first report of PA 
intoxication was in 1985 (50). A 49-year-old 
woman was diagnosed with portal hypertension 
with obliteration of small hepatic venules after 
taking 85 mg of PA for six months. Another recent 
case involved a 66-year-old woman that was 
previously diagnosed with chronic disease. She 
consumed around 1.5 L of comfrey tea, which 
caused progressive dyspnea. Subsequently, she 
developed severe pulmonary hypertension (55). 
Using comfrey leaves as vegetarian diet, a 23-
year-old man reported to have VOD with severe 
portal hypertension and lastly died due to liver 
failure (56). Another case was a 47-year-old 
woman, who consumed ten cups of comfrey tea 
(10 cups daily) as well as comfrey pills for more 
than one year. After four years, she was diagnosed 
with ascites and her liver biopsy showed dense 
fibrosis of portal tracts as well as bile duct 
proliferation around the portal tracts of the liver

(57). Cases of comfrey-induced hepatic VOD 
were reported in young ages and infants beside 
older age patients. One case report of 13-year-old 
boy drank comfrey tea (unknown quantity) for his 
Crohn disease. Liver biopsy was done because of 
hepatomegaly and ascites resulted in hepatic 
VOD (58). Another case report of 18-month-old 
boy showed the evidence of comfrey-induced 
VOD in infants drinking comfrey herbal tea (53).

(Symphytum officinale L.) (59)
Germander (Teucrium chamaedrys L.):
Teucrium chamaedrys L., also known as wall 
germander, is a small herbaceous, perennial and 
aromatic plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae
family (Figure 2E) (5, 60). Germander belongs to 
the East Mediterranean basin and found in all 
European woods (60,61). Since ancient times, 
germander has been used as herbal remedy for 
several properties including antiseptic, 
antidepressant, diuretic, choleretic, and tonic (5, 
17, 60). Globally, wall germander has been used 
as capsules or teas for the treatment of obesity 
and as a weight-loss agent (13,17,60). Moreover, 
germander was considered safe until many cases 
of hepatotoxicity associated with germander 
ingestion were reported in France (62,63). Other 
side effects of germander include nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia, and jaundice (63,64). 
Teucrium chamaedrys L. contains many chemical 
substances including glycosides, saponins, 
neoclerodane diterpenoids, and flavonoids
(5,13,60). Neoclerodane diterpenoids are the 
major chemical compound that may cause liver 
injury. Additionally, the hepatotoxicity may also 
be attributed to Teucrin A and teuchamaedryn A, 
which are components of the diterpenoids fraction 
(13,63,65). In 1992, the germander powder￾containing capsules were prohibited and banned 
from the French market after an epidemic of 30 
cases of hepatitis (13). Several case reports have 
reported the hepatotoxic effect associated with
germander ingestion (5,13,17,60). Larrey et al 
reported seven cases of acute hepatitis after 
germander ingestion (17). One of the cases 
involves a 54-year-old woman, who was taking 
germander capsules for weight loss and developed 
hepatitis. However, after six months of germander 
discontinuation, the women showed a complete 
recovery of the liver function. Larrey et al. also 
reported another case with hepatitis. A 15-year￾old female adolescent, who had abdominal pain 
and developed hepatitis with jaundice after taking 
germander capsules (600 mg/day) for few months 
in combination with other drugs. She recovered 
after one month of germander discontinuation 
(17). Laliberte et al. (5) reported two cases of 
germander-induced hepatitis. The first case is a 
55-year-old woman with no history of liver 
disease who took germander capsules (1600 
mg/day) as a medication for hypercholesterolemia 
with some other drugs. She developed jaundices 
after six months of germander intake and 
diagnosed with hepatitis. However, the liver 
function tests of the patient improved after two 
months germander was discontinued. The second 
case involved a middle-aged woman used
germander (260 mg/day) for 6 month to reduce 
her weight and was diagnosed with jaundice, 
asthenia, and hepatitis. Additionally, there is a 
case of 68-year-old woman who developed 
massive hepatic necrosis following ingestion of 
450 mg daily of wild germander for two weeks 
(66).
Kava (Piper methysticum):
Kava, which is also known as ava, intoxicating 
pepper, awa, kava pepper, kawa, kava root, kawa, 
and kew, is a tropical shrub plant that belongs to 
the Piperaceae family (Figure 2F) (18,68,69). It 
has been traditionally used for centauries in South 
pacific Islands (Hawaii, Polynesia and fidji) for 
ceremonial proposes and as a remedy for 
psychotropic conditions (70,71).

Figure 2: Hepatotoxic Plant (E) Germander (Teucrium 
chamaedrys L.) (67)
For more than 2000 years, south pacific Islanders 
used kava-kava drink from kava plant without 
known side effect (72). Moreover, kava has been 
used by Western as an alcohol replacement to 
reduce anxiety and give relaxation feeling and as 
a treatment for sleeplessness, menopausal 
symptoms and depression (70,73). Rhizomes and 
roots of kava plant were the most used parts for 
their psychoactive properties that include 
sedation, anxiolysis and relaxation (74). 
Accordingly, the most active constituent of kava 
is kavalactones or kavapyrones, which is present 
in high concentration in roots. Kava lactones 
involve six major lactones (kavain, 
dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin, 
yangonin, and desmethoxyyangonin), which are 
responsible for pharmacological activity in 
humans (75). Even though kava known to have no 
side effects in the past, the first report of its side 
effects were reported in Europe (76). Moreover, 
hepatotoxicity associated with kava ingestion was 
also reported in Germany when 24 cases were 
diagnosed with severe liver injury (73). Whitton 
et al (73) indicated that the toxicity of kava was 
due to the extraction methods of lactones and 
posology of this natural product. Several cases 
reported the severe hepatotoxicity of kava leading 
to hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and cholestatic 
hepatitis (70). Humberston et al (68) reported a 
case of acute hepatitis associated with kava-kava 
ingestion in a 14-year-old girl. A liver 
transplantation was performed and she recovered. 
Fu et al. (18) reported another case of kava 
hepatotoxicity. A 45-year-old woman took kava as 
one tablet twice a day for 8 month and she was 
diagnosed with jaundice and hepatitis. The patient 
required liver transplantation and she recovered 
later. More reported cases of kava-associated 
hepatotoxicity came from Europe. Six patients 
were women aged between 22 and 61 years and 
two patients were men with age between 32 and
50 years took kava (60 mg- 240 mg/daily). They 
all required liver transplantation after they were 
diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure (76-78). 
Another case of kava-associated hepatotoxicity 
involved a 50-year-old female, who had hepatic 
necrosis when she had 210 mg/day of kava for 
four months. The woman had a liver failure
however, she lived after liver transplant once 
performed (79). There are some other cases with 
patients, who unfortunately did not survive (77).
Greater celandine (Chelidonium majus L.): 
Greater celandine is a plant that belongs to 
Papaveraceae family. It is an important herb for 
its therapeutic potential and it grows widely in 
Figure 2: Hepatotoxic Plant (F) Kava (Piper 
methysticum) (80)
Europe and Asia (81). Some common synonyms 
are swallow-wort and bai-qu-cai (82). The dried 
aerial parts of greater celandine are used as a 
treatment for gastrointestinal tract disorders (81). 
Greater celandine extract has been used as a 
therapy for jaundice, cholelithiasis and biliary 
colic (83). Additionally, it is known to have 
spasmolytic and alleged choleretic properties 
(84). The whole plant found to have several 
different alkaloids; however, the main alkaloids 
are benzophenan thridines and protoberberines. 
Other common alkaloids are hydroxycinnamic 
acid derivatives (81). The potential hepatotoxicity 
of greater celandine has been reported in several 
case reports. Accordinglly, analysis of case 
reports of 21 patients (18 females aged between 
22-67 year-old and 3 males aged between 58-69 
year-old) showed the causality of hepatotoxicity 
induced by greater celandine (85). There were 
high causality levels for greater celandine in two 
patients and low levels in 13 patients, where in 
the other 6 patients the causality was probable. 
Furthermore, this assessment of case reports 
associates the use of greater celandine preparation 
with liver injury. Stickel et al. (84), provided two 
cases of hepatotoxicity linked with C. majus. The 
first case involved a 39-year-old female who 
diagnosed with impaired hepatic synthetic 
function after ingestion of greater celandine￾containing product as well as sulfamethoxazole 
antibiotic and penicillin.
However, the patient fully recovered after 
discontinuation of the herbal preparation. The 
second case involved a 69-year-old man 
developed cholestatic hepatitis after intake of 
greater celandine-containing drug for 6 weeks for 
his abdominal discomfort. The patient completely 
recovered. Moro et al. (81), reported another case 
of C. majus inducing hepatotoxicity. A 65-year￾old man drank a cup per day of greater celandine 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
382
for a month with lansoprazole medication for his 
bacterial infection. He developed acute cholestatic 
hepatitis with high levels of transaminase and 
bilirubin, but he recovered completely after 
withdrawal of both drugs. Additionally, a 37-year￾old woman diagnosed with cholestatic hepatitis 
after ingestion of several herbal preparations 
including greater celandine for 3 months for her 
atopic eczema. The woman stopped taking greater 
celandine but continued with other medications 
and she recovered (86). Moreover, greater 
celandine showed to cause phototoxicity and 
cytotoxicity on cancer cells (87, 88).
Atractylis gummifera: 
A. gummifera is an herbaceous and thorny plant 
(Asteraceae family) that belongs to Mediterranean 
countries (30,89). It is also known as blue thistle, 
bird-lime, chamaelon, acarna gummifera and 
carlina gummifera L. (89,90,91). A glue-like 
substance with whitish-yellowish color is secreted 
from this plant. A. gummifera root extract is 
commonly used as antipyretic, diuretic, emetic 
and purgative as well as chewing gum (92,93).
However, it is a well known life-threatening 
poisoning (89). The intoxication with A. 
gummifera was first described by Lefrane since
1866 (90). The major toxic constituents are two 
diterpenoid glycosydes: atractyloside (ATR) and 
carboxy-atractyloside (CATR) (90,91). Several 
case reports of A. gummifera inducing toxicity 
were reported and most victims were children 
because of sweet taste of the juice of this herb 
(94). One case report reported intoxication 
associated with consumption of A. gummifera
rhizome in two children aged 4 and 6. They both 
presented with vomiting, abdominal colic, 
cyanosis as well as coma. They were diagnosed 
with congested intestine and had haemorrhages in 
stomach and kidney. The following morning, both 
children died (91). Another case of 7-year-old boy 
presented with vomiting and epigastric pain after 
drinking A. gummifera extract for treating 
oxyuriasis. The boy’s condition worsened and 
died (95).
Impila (Callilepis laureola):
C. laureola is an herbaceous perennial plant that 
belongs to Compositae family (96). It is native to 
KwaZulu-Natal region of northeast of South 
Africa (97). C. laureola is commonly known as 
Impila that means “health” in Zulu (97). Impila 
has been traditionally used as a remedy for 
stomach problems, infertility, cough and worm 
infection (96). Additionally, C. laureola was used 
to word off the evil spirits (98). It is known to be 
highly toxic and very poisonous plant that is 
responsible for several deaths (99). Similar to A. 
gummifera , C. laureola contains toxic 
atractyloside (100). In South Africa, C. laureola
has been linked with some cases of hepatitis and 
renal tubular necrosis (101). Moreover, an 
analysis of 50 children with Impila intoxication 
was done (102). The age of children ranged from 
0 to 12 years and they were diagnosed with 
hypoglycaemia, hepatic dysfunction, renal 
dysfunction and alteration in consciousness level. 
Another case involved a mother (21-year-old) and 
her daughter (1-year-10-month-old) who 
consumed Impila and developed a toxic reaction. 
The mother died due to hepatocellular necrosis 
whereas the child recovered (98).
Chinese Herbal Remedies: 
Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) has been known 
for more than 4000 years and was first found by 
Dhen Nung (103). CHM has been extensively 
used for centuries as a treatment for different 
diseases and conditions (104). However, the use 
of Chinese medicine raised serious concerns 
regarding safety due to unknown composition and 
amount of plants used (94). There are several 
hepatotoxicity effects have been associated with 
different Chinese herbal remedies. Moreover, the 
toxicity of CHM can be attributed to either one or 
several components (94). One of the commonly 
used herb in China is Jin Bu Huan (Lypocodium 
serratum), which has been used for centuries as 
analgesic, sedative and sleeping aid (30). 
Accordingly, Jin Bu Huan (JBH) reported to 
cause various hepatotoxic events (94,105). It
contains a single active constituent that is the 
extract of Lycopodium serratum (94,106). 
Additionally, three females were diagnosed with 
acute hepatitis after consumption of JBH that was 
purchased from the same store (105). The first 
case involved a 66-year-old female who 
consumed 2 tablets (three times per week) as a 
treatment for her back pain and insomnia. The 
second patient (24-year-old) used JBH as a 
treatment for her insomnia (four times per week). 
She presented with jaundice, excoriations of her 
limbs and tender hepatomegaly. The last case 
involved a 45-year-old female presented with 
tender hepatomegaly and used JBH from three to 
four times per week for her insomnia along with 
another herb called “Ma Huang”. Moreover, all 
the patients recovered after discontinuation of 
herbal preparations. Another hepatotoxic effect of 
JBH involved a 49-year-old male diagnosed with 
chronic hepatitis as well as moderate fibrosis after 
ingestion of three tablets of JBH per day (107). 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013

His liver function tests returned to normal after 
discontinuation of JBH. Additionally, a case of 7 
patients aged between 24-66 years old who used 
JBH and presented with fatigue, vomiting, 
nausea, fever and jaundice. They took from 2 to 6 
tablets of JBH weekly (2-7 times) for treating 
insomnia, back pain and arthralgia. The all 
developed acute hepatitis due to JBH intake 
(108). Another common Chinese herbal remedy is 
Ma Huang, which is a product that derived from 
the aerial parts of Ephedra sinica plant that found 
in Mongolia and China (109,110,111). Ma Huang 
is known in English as “Yellow astringent” and 
has been traditionally used in China for the 
treatment of bronchitis and cough and as a 
slimming aid (109,112,113). Additionally, this 
medicinal herb has been used to enhance energy 
levels (110). Despite the prolong use of Ephedra
in Chinese traditional medicine; it has been linked 
to many serious hepatotoxic effects 
(110,111,114,115). The major constituent in Ma 
Huang that is responsible for toxic effects is 
Ephedrine (110). Accordingly, Ephedrine showed 
to cause severe acute hepatitis in 33-year-old 
woman who used Chines herbal medicine 
containing Ma Huang (110). Another hepatotoxic 
case associated with Ma Huang consumption 
involved a 28-year-old man who had Ma Huang 
for 2 month for bodybuilding. He developed 
hepatitis and recovered after discontinuation of 
herbal product (114). Ma Huang hepatotoxicity 
was seen in 44-year-old man who had over the 
counter drug called “Hydroxycut” for weight loss 
(3 capsule for 4 months). The man developed 
toxic hepatitis due to Hydroxycut, which found to 
contain Ma Huang extract. However, the patient 
recovered after cessation of the drug (115). 
Moreover, a 61-year-old man drank Ma Huang 
infusions and presented with hepatorenal 
syndrome as well as several thromboembolic 
conditions (116). Another case of Ma Huang 
related hepatotoxicity involved a 57-year-old 
woman who took two Chinese herbal products 
(one contains Ma Huang) for the treatment of 
sinusitis. The woman developed jaundice and 
acute liver failure and recovered after liver 
transplantation was done (109). Additionally, Ma 
Huang has been associated with high blood 
pressure and high heart rate in 42-year-old male 
who took E. sinica along with Saw palmetto and 
multivitamins for bodybuilding (117). The patient 
was diagnosed with hypertension and tachycardia 
due to ingestion of this herbal product. Lastly, a 
23-year-old male student found dead in his 
apartment after consumption of Ma Huang￾containing drink once or twice per day for more 
than 6 month (118). Moreover, Shou-Wu-Pian is 
another common Chinese herbal mixture. Shou￾Wu-Pian preparation is formulated from the root 
of Polygonum multiflorum plant (fleece flower 
root), which is a common Chines herb that 
belongs to Polygonaceae family (113,119). Shou￾Wu-Pian is alternatively known as He-Shou-Wu 
and Mr. Black Hair (119,120). The roots and 
vines of P. multiflorum have been used as a tonic 
for treating several conditions including 
backache, constipation, dizziness, greying of hair, 
spermatorrhea, lumbago and treating symptoms of 
chronic prostatitis (120,121,122). Shou-Wu-Pian 
has been well known for its association with 
longevity and youthfulness (120). Furthermore, 
several cases of hepatotoxicity associated with 
Shou-Wu-Pian consumption have been reported 
(112,121,123,124). The Shou-Wu-Pian 
hepatotoxicity has been attributed to its toxic 
constituent, anthraquinone (120). One of the 
reported hepatotoxic cases involved a 46-year-old 
woman who had an acute hepatitis after ingestion 
of Shou-Wu-Pian for greying of hair. She 
recovered after discontinuation of the herbal 
medicine (120). Another 53-year-old woman had 
toxic reaction due to Shou-Wu-Pian consumption 
and developed acute hepatitis. She also recovered 
after cessation of the herbal product (125). 
Additionally, Panis et al (119) reported the first 
case of Shou-Wu-Pian inducing hepatotoxicity in 
pediatric. A 5-year-old girl presented with acute 
liver injury twice related to Shou-Wu-Pian 
product. Another reported case of hepatotoxicity 
involved a 17-week pregnant woman who 
consumed Shou-Wu-Pian for treating hair loss. 
She presented with jaundice and diagnosed with 
acute toxic hepatitis (119). Moreover, a 78-year￾old male used Shou-Wu-Pian for the treatment of 
chronic prostatitis and developed acute hepatitis. 
The patient recovered after discontinuation of the 
herbal medicine (121). Additionally, Dictamnus 
dasycarpus is another botanical that presents in 
Chinese herbal mixture (126). It belongs to 
Rutaceae family and has been used as a remedy 
for skin diseases, cough, jaundice and rheumatism 
(127). D. dasycarpus has been linked with some 
hepatotoxic events as well as death 
(10,128,129,130,131). One case of hepatic injury 
involved a 49-year-old female presented with 
itching and jaundice after drinking a mixture of 
Chinese herbal tea for her eczematous skin 
disease. Hepatomegaly and elevated liver 
enzymes were presented and the patient was 
diagnosed with reversible acute hepatitis due to 
intake of Chinese herbs. The analysis of Chinese 
mixture showed the presence of couple of 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
384
botanicals including D. dasycarpus (128). 
Another case of Chinese mixture toxicity 
involved 51-year-old male who previously had 
psoriasis and took a mixture of Chinese herbs 
daily for 8 weeks. His liver function tests were 
substantially elevated and he died (129). 
Moreover, a 61-year-old female took Chinese 
herbal preparations for 11 months as a remedy for 
eczema. The patient presented with jaundice, 
malaise, nausea, and weight loss. Her Chinese 
mixture found to contain a constituent of D.
dasycarpus (130). Another case of a 39-year old 
female presented with anorexia, fatigue and 
nausea after ingestion of mixture of Chinese 
plants daily for 2 months to treat her psoriasis. 
The Chinese mixture found to contain D.
dasycarpus as one of herbs (130). 
Kampo Medicine: 
Kampo medicine is a Chinese medicine that has 
been produced in Japan and it is a mixture of 
several herbs (111). Dai-Saiko-to or TJ-8 is a 
kampo formula that consists of seven herbs and 
used for the treatment of dyspepsia, fever, 
gallstones, fatigue, and chronic hepatitis (10,132). 
However, some reports reported cases of 
hepatotoxicity associated with consumption of 
Dai-Saiko-to. One case of hepatotoxicity included
a 55-year-old female who took Dai-Saiko-to for 3 
weeks and presented with fatigue, fever and 
increased liver enzymes. She was diagnosed with 
autoimmune hepatitis (132). Another case 
involved a 65-year-old man who ingested a 7.5 g 
of Dai-Saiko-to with other herbs included Shohu￾san and Hange-shashin-to for 7 weeks for treating 
his dermatitis. The patient presented with dyspnea 
and diagnosed with hepatic injury due to herbal 
preparation (10). Accordingly, the toxic agents 
presented in Dai-Saiko-to could be attributed to 
glycyrrhiza and scutellaria constituents (132).
Another kampo herb is Syo-saiko-to, which has 
been used as a therapy for pyretic diseases and 
liver diseases in Japan, Taiwan, and China. It is 
also known as Xiao-chai-hu-tang or da-chai-hu￾tang in China and TJ-9 in Japan (10,111,113,133).
Syo-saiko-to consists of seven different botanicals 
including Scutellaria and Glycyrrhiza (111). 
Accordingly, some cases of hepatotoxicity have 
been reported due to intake of Syo-saiko-to. Four 
cases of four females aged between 42 and 58 had 
7.5 g of Syo-saiko-to for up to 7 weeks as a 
therapy for acute hepatitis (134). They all 
presented with jaundice and diagnosed with 
inflammation of portal tract, fibrosis, 
microvesicular fatty change, acidophilic 
degeneration and two of them developed 
cholestasis. The toxic compound in Syo-saiko-to 
for these cases found to be bicalin in Scutellaria 
and glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza (133). Moreover, 
Syo-saiko-to showed to contain glycyrrhizin-a 
triterpenic saponoside- that causes liver diseases 
including fatal hepatic necrosis, hepatic 
granulomas and microvesicular steatosis (113). 
Kombucha “mushroom” Tea: 
Kombusha tea is a health drink that made by the 
fermentation of sweetened black tea with 
kombucha fungus, which is a symbiotic yeast￾bacteria aggregate that surrounded by a permeable 
membrane (135,136); which is not a real 
mushroom (136). Kombusha has other synonyms 
such as Manchurian mushroom tea, Manchurian 
fungus tea or Kargasok tea (113,135). This 
healthy beverage has been used as therapy for 
several conditions like treating cancer, increasing 
T cell count, lowering blood pressure, curing 
arthritis, treating gastrointestinal disorders and 
alleviating constipation (135,136). Kombusha tea 
is also known as “fountain of youth” tonic as it 
restores the gray hair, reduces wrinkles and treats 
acne (136,137). However, kombusha beverage has 
been associated with several cases of 
hepatotoxicity and other side effects 
(135,138,139). A case of hepatitis due to intake of 
Kombusha drink was reported in a 53-year old 
professor (137). He drank the preparation as a 
half cup twice a day for two weeks that advised 
by his friend for treating his hypothyroidism and 
fibromyalgia conditions. However, he recovered 
after discontinuation of the Kombusha drink. 
Moreover, two females (59 and 48-years-old) 
reported drinking Kombusha beverage. The first 
patient had 4 oz daily for 2 months and developed 
sever metabolic acidosis and died. The second 
patient increased amount of tea from 4 to 12 oz 
daily for 14 days and developed acute pulmonary 
edema and sever metabolic acidosis. Additionally, 
the patient had cardiac arrest but her health 
improved (138). Another case of Kombusha 
toxicity involved a 22-year-old male who 
diagnosed with HIV and decided to use 
Kombusha tea as it known to increases the T cell 
count (139). The patient developed acute renal 
failure as well as hyperthermia and lactic acidosis 
after 12 hours of Kombusha intake. Furthermore, 
two females aged 55 and 51 drank Kombusha tea 
to improve their health; the first patient developed 
jaundice and second patient had breathing 
shortness, akathisia and shaking (135). 
Additionally, two men aged 53 and 83 drank 
Kombusha tea as one-half cup daily for 3 weeks 
and developed transaminitis (139). However, both

385
patients recovered after cessation of the beverage. 
The exact toxic agent of Kombusha mushroom is 
unknown but it showed to have usnic acid that is 
derived from lichen (106,113). However, its toxic 
reaction could be due to contamination of the tea. 
Moreover, preparation and storage of Kombusha 
tea must be made in glass containers as lead and 
ceramic can leach toxic components into 
preparation (140). Two cases of symptomatic lead 
poisoning due to Kombusha tea have been 
reported in one couple. They both drank 
Kombusha tea in ceramic container, which was
covered by glaze made of lead (139).
Senna (Cassia angustifolia): 
C. angustifolia, commonly known as Senna or 
Tinnevelly, is a plant that is native to Arabia and 
belongs to Fabaceae family (141,142). The leaves 
(pods) and fruits of senna have been used as 
laxative in form of herbal tea (141,142). However, 
excessive abuse of C. angustifolia has been 
implicated in few cases of hepatotoxicity. 
Accordingly, a 26-year-old female was diagnosed 
with toxic hepatitis after intake of herbal tea 
containing 10 g of senna leaves and 100 mg of 
sennoside B (extract of senna fruit) twice a week
(143). Another case of senna hepatotoxicity 
involved a 52-year-old woman who drank 1L of 
herbal tea containing 70 g of Senna dried fruit for 
more than 3 years. The patient developed acute 
liver failure with renal impairment due to chronic 
use of C. angustifolia (141). Moreover, a 42-
year-old female presented with epigastric pain, 
vomiting and intermittent fever after intake of 200 
ml of dried senna leaves for 2 years. The patient 
was diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis (PVT)
(142). Another case of subacute cholestatic 
hepatitis has been reported in 77-year-old male. 
The patient admitted taking Senna for the 
treatment of constipation (144). Additionally, 
chronic use of C. angustifolia has been associated 
with serious conditions like chronic diarrhea and 
loss of fluid and electrolyte (141). Furthermore, 
cases of sever hepatic damage associated with 
Senna are rare. The hepatotoxic effect of Senna 
can be ascribed to its major constituent, 
sennosides, which are present in leaves and fruits. 
Sennosides split to rhein anthron that resemble 
hepatototoxic danthron (93,141,143). 
Anthraquinone glycosides also present in senna, 
which are suspected to cause hepatic diseases as 
well (100,143).
Pennyroyal oil: 
Pennyroyal oil, which is also known as 
squawmint oil, is derived from two plant species 
Hedeoma pulegoides and Mentha pulegium
(100,145). It has a mint-like odor and it has been 
used as insect repellent and abortifacient since 
Roman times (146,147). Pennyroyal oil has been 
used as a treatment for cold, menstruation and to 
purify blood (148,149). Additionally, it has been
used as a therapy for upper respiratory tract and 
ear infections (149). However, sever cases of 
hepatotoxicity associated with pennyroyal oil 
ingestion have been reported (150). A small 
amount of oil (10-15 ml) can cause sever toxicity 
like liver and lung damage and can cause death as 
well (148,149). The primary constituent of 
pennyroyal oil is pulegone and it contains some 
other monoterpenes such as neomenthone, 
menthone and iso-menthone (149).
Accordingly, one case of pennyroyal oil 
toxicity involved an 8 week-old boy who drank 
around 120 ml of tea made from mint plant that 
contains toxic pennyroyal oil. The infant had 
fulminant liver failure with cerebral edema caused 
by menthofuran constituent of pennyroyal oil. He 
died shortly after initial symptoms appeared
(150). Another case involved a 6 month-old boy 
who took aspirin and 90 ml of tea (3 times per 
week) from home grown mint plant for his 
congestion and colic. The baby had hepatic 
dysfunction with sever epileptic encephalopathy. 
The plant found to contain both menthofuran and 
pulegone (150). Additionally, 24 year-old women 
took both pennyroyal extract and black cohosh 
root for induction of abortion. She continued 
taking pennyroyal and black cohosh with 
unknown amount and she died (149). Anderson et 
al (149) reported two cases of pennyroyal oil 
toxicity in two women who drank a preparation of 
pennyroyal tea to induce menses. The first woman 
developed dizziness and weakness after ingestion 
of tea and recovered later. The other woman had 
mild abdominal cramps; however, she drank more 
of the tea because the menses did not start and 
developed sever abdominal cramps and nausea. 
After 5 days the menses occurred and she 
recovered. Some studies showed that N￾acetylcysteine provides a protection against 
pennyroyal inducing hepatotoxicity (30,150).
Margosa oil (Azadirachta indica):
Margosa oil, yellowish oil with disagreeable taste 
and smell, is extracted from Neem tree seeds that 
are native to India (151). Margosa oil or Neem oil 
is usually given to infants in India, Thailand, 
Indonesia and Sri Lanka to maintain good health. 
The oil contains volatile sulphor compounds, fatty 
acids as well as bitters like nimbin, nimbidin, 
nimbinin and nimbidol, which are responsible for 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
386
its toxicity (151). Accordingly, hepatotoxicity of 
neem oil resembles Reye’s like syndrome, which 
characterizes by mitochondrial toxicity, 
microvesicular steatosis and depletion of hepatic 
ATP and glycogen stores (93). One case of neem 
poisoning that resembles Reye’s syndrome has 
been reported in an infant. The liver biopsy of this 
infant showed fatty infiltration of liver, proximal 
renal tubules and cerebral edema (152). Two cases 
of encephalopathy caused by margosa oil 
poisoning in infants have been reported (151). A 
5-month-old boy given 5 ml of oil after drinking 
milk presented with generalized convulsions and 
loss of consciousness. The second patient was a 3-
month-old girl who had few drops of oil presented 
with generalized convulsions. Both babies 
recovered. Furthermore, Sinniaf et al (152,153) 
reported Reye-like syndrome due to intake of 
Margosa oil in 13 infants and children. Another 
case of Neem oil poisoning involved a 5-year-old 
boy who developed a neurodeficit due to 
accidental intake of Margosa oil (154). Moreover, 
Neem oil reported to cause renal tubular acidosis 
in 51-year-old man after consumption of large 
amount of oil (155). The patient was also 
diagnosed with hepatotoxicity, anemia, 
encephalopathy and coagulopathy. 
St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum):
Hypericum perforatum is an herbaceous perennial 
herb that is indigenous to Europe (156). The aerial 
part of this herb is used for the preparation of St. 
John’s Wort (SJW) extract that has been 
traditionally used for more than 200 years as a 
remedy for wide spectrum of medical illnesses 
such as insomnia, bronchitis, burns, gastritis, 
hypothyroidism, insect and snake bites, scabies 
and cancer (156,157,158). Mainly, SJW has been 
used as an anti-depressant remedy and became 
one of the top selling anti-depressant agents
(156,158). H. perforatum has been known to 
interact with numbers of drugs, which can be 
beneficial like increasing response of clopidogrel 
and reducing toxicity of irinotecan (159). 
However, SJW raised concerns regarding its life￾threatening interaction with other conventional 
drugs including cardiovascular (Digoxin), oral 
contraceptives, immunosuppressants 
(Cyclosporin), chemotherapeutics (Irinotecan), 
anti-depressants (Amitriptyline), anti-diabetics 
(Gliclazide), anti-androgenics (Finasteride), anti￾retrovirals (Indinavir), benzodiazepines and 
statins (111,158,159,160). Particularly, these 
drugs are substrates of either cytochrome P450 or 
P-glycoprotein (156). Moreover, interactions of 
SJW with other drugs reported to cause sever 
consequences involving the reduction of blood 
cyclosporine levels, reduction of plasma levels of 
anticancer and antiretroviral drugs, causing 
serotonin syndrome or unwanted pregnancies 
(156,159). One case involved a 59-year-old male 
who presented with hyperlipidemia and initially 
took pravastatin (80 mg/day). His medication 
changed to rosuvartatin (10 mg/day) due to 
presentation of hypercholesterolemia. He 
admitted taking SJW (300 mg twice/day) as a 
remedy for insomnia. Accordingly, the total levels
of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol level were markedly increased due to 
SJW-rosuvartatin interaction (161). Additionally, 
a 29-year-old female underwent cadaveric kidney 
and pancreas transplant and had been on 
cyclosporine (100 mg) twice a day as well as H.
perforatum extract (300 mg) twice a day for up to 
8 weeks. The patient presented with reduced 
plasma cyclosporine concentrations due to 
interaction between SJW and cyclosporine drug 
(162). Another case of SJW-drug interaction is 
presented in a 36-year-old patient who received a 
liver transplant due to cirrhosis. The patient took a 
cyclosporine drug (175 mg) twice a day with H.
perforatum tablets (900 mg) twice a day as an 
anti-depressant. The patient developed severe 
acute rejection as well as reduction of 
cyclosporine level (163). Another case of SJW￾drug interaction has been reported in a 41-year￾old female diagnosed with disorganized 
schizophrenia. She took clozapine (500 mg/day) 
for 6 months accompanied with SJW extract (300 
mg three times/day). The clozapine plasma 
concentration was reduced and disorganization 
was increased in the patient due to SJW-clozapine 
interaction (164). Moreover, SJW consists of 
several pharmacological active constituents but 
the main ingredient is hyperforin, which is 
suspected to cause SJW-drug interaction 
(156,157). Another important ingredient of SJW 
is hypericin, which can cause some of herb-drug 
interaction events (159). Moreover, Hyperforin 
showed to interact with many neurotransmitters 
such as serotonin, dopamine, gammaaminobutyric 
acid, glutamate and noradrenaline (156). 
Valerian (Valeriana officinalis):
Valeriana officinalis is a plant (Valerianaceae
family) that is indigenous to North America, 
Europe and Asia (165). The dried root of V.
officinalis is known as valerian, which has been 
used for long time by ancient Rome and Greece 
as sedative and anti anxiety remedy and for 
treating insomnia (165,166). Additionally, it has 
been used as a remedy for treating palpitation, 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
387
headache, gastrointestinal pain, high blood 
pressure, sleeping disorders and menstrual cramps 
(166). Valerian is a common herb and found in 
many over the counter preparation either alone or 
combined with other herbs (167). Some 
hepatotoxic events associated with valerian 
ingestion have been reported. The first cases of 
valerian-induced hepatotoxicity were reported in 
1989, where 4 patients took over the counter sleep 
aids containing valerian (168). Another case of 
valerian hepatotoxicity was described in a 27-
year-old female took 1 capsule of valerian root 
extract for 3 months and developed hepatic 
inflammation. She recovered after discontinuation 
of herbal preparation (165). Moreover, valerian 
showed to have an interaction ability with other 
botanicals and can cause a sever injuries (169). 
Accordingly, a 43-year-old woman who ingested 
valerian with skullcap and black cohosh and some 
other herbal preparations developed hepatitis (14). 
MacGregor et al. (168) described four cases of 
herb-herb interaction causing hepatic injury. Four 
women aged between 41 and 57 developed acute 
hepatitis after consumption of two herbal 
medications (Kalms and Neurelax) for stress 
relief. Later studies showed that Kalms contains 
valerian and skullcap as well as some other herbs 
where Neurelax contains skullcap only. 
Mistletoe (Viscum album):
Mistletoe is a woody perennial plant that belongs 
to Loranthaceae family and grows on oaks and 
other trees (170). It is native to Asia, Europe and 
England (170,171). Some synonyms of mistletoe 
are all-heal, bird lime mistletoe, bird lime, 
European mistletoe, and viscum (170). Helixor, 
Iscucin, Iscador and Plenosol are trade names of 
mistletoe (171). All mistletoe parts have been 
widely used as a treatment for several conditions 
including hypertension, headache, insomnia, 
epilepsy, asthma, infertility, cancer and urinary 
disorders (30,171). Accordingly, mistletoe found 
to have potential toxic constituents including β￾phenylethylamine, acetylcholine, tyramine and 
propionylcholine (172). It also contains lectins 
and viscotoxin that cause several side effects such 
as hypertension, chills and fever (170). The 
hepatotoxicity related to mistletoe consumption is 
rare and only few cases have been reported (111). 
One case report involved a 49-year-old woman 
presented with general malaise, nausea and dull 
ache in the right hypochondrium. She admitted 
taking herbal medication containing Mistletoe, 
skullcap, motherwort and kelp for her nervous 
tension and she developed acute hepatitis (172). 
Skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis):
Scutellaria baicalensis is an herbaceous herb that 
belongs to mint family and has two species. The 
first species is S. baicalensis that is alternatively 
known as Chinese skullcap, Baikal skullcap or 
Huang-qin and commonly used in Chinese 
medicine. The second species is S. lateriflora that 
also known as blue skullcap, hoodwort or 
Virginian skullcap that is native to Americans 
(173,174). Scutellaria has been used as a sedative 
and anti-inflammatory agents (106) and for
treating several ailments like cancer, jaundice, 
hepatitis, anxiety, nervous tension, hysteria and 
epilepsy (168,175,176). Both species includes 
terpenoid compounds, which can cause 
hepatotoxic effects (111). Several case reports of 
hepatotoxicity after skullcap ingestion either 
alone or in combination with other botanicals 
have been reported (173). One case report of 28-
year-old man developed fulminant hepatic failure 
with multiple sclerosis after congestion of 
skullcap (6 tablets/ day) with pau d’ arco and 
Zinc. The patient required liver transplantation 
and died shortly after the liver transplant. He was 
diagnosed with veno-occlusive disease and fatal 
hepatic failure due to contamination of herbs with 
toxic plants (176). Another case involved a 78-
year-old woman who took one herbal supplement 
called “Move Free Advanced“ with multivitamins 
daily for treating arthritis. The woman presented 
with significant cholestasis and hepatitis; 
however, she improved after discontinuation of 
herbal medicine. Move Free Advanced 
supplement found to contain Chinese skullcap and 
black catecho (173). Another case of skullcap 
hepatotoxicity included a 77-year-old female who 
presented with weight loss, anorexia and 
tiredness. The patient consumed 6 units of alcohol 
per week. She was diagnosed with hepatitis with 
pulmonary complication. Later, she admitted 
taking three herbal preparations, which are BFC 
(for wasting diseases), Nervine (for anxiety) and 
Bowel tonic (for peristalsis) three times per day 
for 6 month. Further investigation reported the 
presence of skullcap and comfrey in BFC, which 
caused hepatic injury and pulmonary lesions in 
the patient (177). Other case reports of 
hepatotoxicity due to interaction of skullcap with 
other botanical were mentioned earlier 
(14,168,172).
Noni juice (Morinda citrifolia): 
Noni juice is derived from Polynesian tropical 
fruit of Morinda citrifolia tree and it is commonly 
used in European tabloid press (100). Fruit, roots 
and leaves of M. citrifolia has been used for more

388
than 2000 years as a herbal remedy and wellness 
drink (178,179,180). Additionally, it has ben used 
for treating many health problems including 
cancer, AIDS, elevated blood pressure and mental 
depression (178,181). However, noni juice has 
been associated with several hepatotoxicity 
events. The potential toxic constituent of M.
citrifolia is anthraquinones like moridone, 
nordamnacanthal, rubiadin, rubiadin-1-methyl 
ether, anthraquinone glycoside, which are known 
for their hepatotoxic potential (180,182). 
According to Stadlbauer et al. (180), a 29-year￾old man who previously had acute hepatitis due to 
paracetamol developed sub acute hepatic failure 
after consumption of 1.5 L of noni juice for more 
than 3 weeks. The patient required a liver 
transplantation. Moreover, a 62-year-old woman 
who drank 2 L of noni juice developed acute 
hepatitis and recovered after cessation of herbal 
drink (180). Another case of toxicity associated 
with noni juice involved a 45-year-old man who 
had a glass of noni juice daily for few weeks for 
prophylactic reason. He developed an acute 
hepatitis and recovered after withdrawal of herbal 
drink (178). Fulminant hepatitis was reported in 
24-year-old female after consumption of noni 
juice for stimulation of her immune system (182). 
The patient recovered after discontinuation of the 
noni drink. Moreover, a 14-year-old-boy drank 
approximately 600 ml of an antioxidant drink to 
improve energy and developed acute hepatitis. 
The drink contains several ingredients including 
noni berries (91 mg/kg). However, the boy’s 
health improved (183).
Amanita phalloides: 
One of serious species that causes sever 
mushroom poisoning is Amanita, mostly A.
phalloides or death cap (94,184). There are two 
diverse groups of toxins found in Amanita. The 
first toxin is phalloidin, which affects enterocytes 
cellular membrane (184). The second toxin is 
amanitins mainly α- amanitin, which is absorbed 
in gastrointestinal tract and can affect liver (184). 
The later is also responsible for the damage of 
kidney, pancreas, brain, testes and hematopoietic 
system. Additionally, death can be resulted from 
α- amanitin poisoning (94). One case of fulminant 
hepatic failure after ingestion of A. phalloides was 
reported. A 64-year-old woman presented with 
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea 
after consumption of wild mushroom (2 bowl) 
from her backyard. The patient was diagnosed 
with fulminant liver failure and required liver 
transplantation. In this case, the wild mushroom 
(A. phalloides) found to contain α- amanitin that 
induced hepatotoxicity (185). Another case of A.
phalloides poisoning involved a 16-year-old 
female who presented with vomiting, abdominal 
pain, diarrhea and nausea. She had wild 
mushroom and diagnosed with liver failure and 
required liver transplantation (186). Moreover,
four cases of A. phalloides poisoning have been 
reported in children (187). One case involved a 
2.5-year-old female presented with diarrhea and 
vomiting after ingestion of two mushrooms 
picked by her mother from the woods. The girl 
had elevated liver enzymes and died due to 
massive hepatocellular necrosis as well as 
macrovesicular steatosis. The second case 
involved an 8-year-old male presented with 
abdominal pain and nausea after eating fried 
mushroom. He had elevated liver enzymes and 
developed renal failure and died due to multiple 
organ failure. The third case involved an 11-year￾old boy who ate fried mushroom collected by his 
mother from forest and presented with vomiting, 
nausea and diarrhea. All his family ate from the 
same mushroom on their breakfast. They all had 
high liver function tests. The mother died but 
other family members recovered after treatment 
including the 11-year-old boy. The last case 
involved a 10-year-old male presented with 
vomiting and developed hepatic encephalopathy 
after eating mushroom that he picked. His 
condition worsened and required an orthotopic 
liver transplantation due to development of 
fulminant liver failure. However, the boy 
recovered after transplantation. In all four cases, 
A. phalloides mushroom found to be responsible 
for mushroom poisoning (187). Moreover, a 72-
year-old female and her 45-year-old son presented 
with diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain after 
consumption of wild mushroom picked by 
themselves. They both had elevated liver enzymes 
and diagnosed with A. phalloides poisoning. They 
recovered after receiving treatment (188).
Sassafras (Sassafras albidum): 
Sassafras albidum is an aromatic tree, which is 
native to Eastern North America (189). Sassafras 
oil that obtained from both root and root bark has 
been used as flavoring and sudorific agent as well 
as treatment for insect bites and stings (189). It 
also used as a therapy of inflammation of eyes, 
urinary tract conditions and kidney diseases 
(145,189). The main active constituent of 
Sassafras oil is safrol (80%), which is also present 
in nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper and mace 
(145,190). Moreover, it has been found that a 
small amount of sassafras oil can be toxic to 
human (191). In 1949, the consumption of large 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
389
quantity of sassafras oil reported to cause 
neurological effects like hallucinogenic and 
psychoactive effects (192). In 1960, the FDA 
banned the use of this oil due to high safrole 
levels (145). Accordingly, sassafras oil has been 
classified as a hepatocarcinogen of low grade 
(192). One case of death in a man who consumed 
sassafras oil (1 teaspoonful) has been reported 
(190). The patient used synthetic form of the oil 
and presented with vomiting, collapse and stupor 
then died. Additionally, five cases of children 
aged between 1 and 2.5 years old reported 
consumption of sassafras oil and presented with 
several symptoms. All children were vomiting, 
two were stupor, one had aphasic symptom, one 
presented with shock sign and three had vertigo 
signs (190). 
Echinacea:
Echinacea consists of three species that has been 
used medicinally including E. angustifolia, E. 
pallida and E. purpurea (158,193,194). It is a 
perennial herb that is native to North America and 
commonly known as purple coneflower 
(194,195). Other synonyms include black 
Sampson, black susan, hedgehog, indian head, 
comb flower and Missouri snake root (136). 
Echinacea has been used by Plains Indians as a 
remedy for respiratory infection and fever (194). 
It also has been used as immune booster and as a 
therapy of common cold (169,195). Accordingly,
Echinacea contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), 
which explains the hepatotoxicity associated with 
it (196). One case of Echinacea hepatotoxicity 
involved a 45-year-old man who diagnosed with 
acute cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis due to 
intake of Echinacea (197). However, no 
significant hepatotoxicity of Echinacea has been 
reported. The potential hepatotoxic effect of 
Echinacea is when taken for more than 8 weeks 
and with other known hepatotoxic drugs like 
amiodarone, anabolic steroids, ketoconazole or 
methotrexate (193,194). Furthermore, there are 
other known Pyrrolizidine alkaloids-containing 
herbs that have been associated with hepatic 
injury as well as death including Heliotropium,
Senecio and Crotalaria (10,93,94,198,199). These 
herbs are common in Africa and Jamaica where 
intoxication with PA is accidental due to 
contaminated food (30). In 1992 and 1993, 
around 4000 individuals had abdominal pain, 
ascites, alteration of consciousness and 
hepatomegaly after consumption of grain 
contaminated with Heliotrpopium lasiocarpum
(200). Additionally, four women were diagnosed 
with VOD after intake of herbal tea containing 
Heliotrpopium lasiocarpum in China (201). 
Senecio species like S. burchelli and S. ilicifolius
have been associated with several hepatic diseases 
(94,199,202). A 5-day-old female infant
diagnosed with fatal hepatic VOD (199). The 
mother used to drink herbal tea daily during her 
pregnancy with consumption of cannabis and 
hallucinogenic mushroom. The herbal tea found 
to contain PA and senecionine. Another case of 
Senecio intoxication reported in Arizona where 
two infants diagnosed with VOD (94). 
Accordingly, several cases of Senecio poisoning 
have been reported (202). The patients were 
presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
accumulation of ascitic fluid and hepatomegaly, 
which are features of Chiari's syndrome. 
Moreover, Crotalaria species reported to cause 
hepatic damage as well (203). In Jamaica, 
children were diagnosed with hepatomegaly, 
ascites and cirrhosis after intake of bush tea as a 
therapy for acute illness. Bush tea found to 
contain Crotalaria and Senecio (30).
DISCUSSION
Herbal medicines have been used for centuries 
and there usage continues to rise worldwide due 
to the perception that natural products from plants 
are safer than usual drugs and free of side effects 
(5). However, severe liver injury has been 
observed following the consumption of several 
plant preparations (204). Hence, the liver is the 
major target of injuries induced by drugs because 
it is the main organ of drug metabolisms, where 
foreign chemicals are transformed by 
metabolizing enzymes including mixed-function 
monooxygenases, microsomal cytochrome P450 
enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltrans-ferases, 
sulfotransferases, and glutathione-S-transferases 
(205). Moreover, botanical-induced 
hepatotoxicity and liver abnormalities have been 
extensively documented. Many herbal remedies 
have been recognized as toxins that cause mild or 
severe liver damage and some have fatal 
outcomes (204). In this review, we listed cases of 
adverse hepatic effects associated with the use of 
natural medicine and the potential risk of some 
herbs.
Actea racemosa or Cimicifuga racemosa, 
which is commonly known as black cohosh, has 
been widely used as a common treatment of 
symptoms of menopause among women. It has 
also been reported to be safe and to improve 
menopausal symptoms (204-207). Although 
several studies demonstrated the efficacy of black 
cohosh as a therapy (208-211), hepatotoxicity 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
390
associated with black cohosh ingestion was 
reported (205). The concerns regarding the safety 
of cimicifuga is due to the composition of this 
plant, which consists of both hepatoprotective and
hepatotoxic components (1,14,212,213). 
Moreover, previous reports have been associated 
black cohosh with fulminant liver failure (24), 
autoimmune hepatitis (25), and acute hepatitis 
(14). Accordingly, the main mechanism of injury 
of black cohosh is unknown. However, the 
hepatotoxicity could be attributed to the triterpene 
glycoside, the major constituent of black cohosh, 
as well as an immunoallergic mechanism due to 
presence of tissue eosinophilia (106,113). Another 
potentially hepatotoxic plant is Larrea tridentate, 
or chaparral bush, that has been widely used for 
treating variety of conditions include snakebite, 
bronchitis and rheumatic pain (15,29). On the 
other hand, many cases have been reported as a 
proof of causal relationship of chaparral and 
hepatotoxicity (15,32,214-218). Accordingly, liver 
injury associated with chaparral consumption
includes acute hepatitis (31,216,214), hepatic 
fibrosis (31), and hepatic necrosis (32). Some 
studies linked chaparral toxicity with duration of 
use as toxicity increases with long duration (219). 
Additional to hepatotoxicity, chaparral ingestions 
have been associated with dermatologic and renal 
toxicity as well (15). The mechanism of action of 
chaparral toxicity remains unknown (93). 
However, it could be attributed to its active 
constituent, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), 
which causes inhibition of lipoxygenase or 
cyclooxygenase pathways (220), inhibition of 
cytochrome p450 (221) and chaparral estrogen 
activity (219). Saw palmetto, the active ingredient 
in Serenoa repens, is an American dwarf palm 
tree that is widely used for BPH (222). Since 
1800s, the berries of this plant have been known 
for their medicinal importance to treat patients
with prostatic enlargement (223). Some mild side 
effects have been associated with S. repens such 
as headache, abdominal pain, and nausea (35). 
Additionally, saw palmetto was found to be 
hepatotoxic and harboring severe side effects 
including acute liver damage (41), cholestatic 
hepatitis (113) and acute pancreatitis (16,36,224). 
According to Hamid, Rojter & Vierling (39),
prostata is a common preparation of saw palmetto 
that has been implicated in protracted cholestatic 
hepatitis. The mechanism by which saw palmetto 
induces its effect is not fully understood (36), 
however; some suggestions are pointing to the 
estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects (36). 
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids-containing herbs have 
been used as herbal remedies to treat many 
illnesses. One of well-known pyrrolizidine 
alkaloids-containing agent is Symphytum 
officinale that is commonly known as comfrey
(8,54). Leaves and roots of comfrey have been 
used as a remedy externally (bone fractures, 
reduce joint inflammation, wound healing) and 
internally (gastroduodenal ulcers and gastritis) 
(8,46). However, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which 
were first recognized as toxins in 1920 (225), are 
major health hazards (8). Comfrey has been 
reported to be hepatotoxic and cause hepatic VOD 
(8). VOD of the liver has been linked with 
ingestion of contaminated plants with 
pyrrolizidine alkaloids (54). Moreover, some 
other factors that contribute to VOD of the liver 
include chemotherapy, irradiation, tyrosinaemia 
and systemic lupus erythromatosus (54). The 
mechanism of action of comfrey has not been 
established due to the involvement of multiple 
constituents (226). Hepatotoxicity of comfrey 
could be linked to several factors including 
susceptibility of host, route of exposure as well as 
ingested dose (43,51). Though, comfrey-induce 
injury could be due to destruction of veins that 
cause cirrhosis and finally liver failure (226) or 
hepatic congestion due to fibrous obliteration of 
small hepatic veins (54). Another serious drug￾induced hepatotoxicity is constituted by Teucrium
genus, which involves over 300 species 
worldwide (60). Two important species are 
Teucrium chamaedrys (wall germander) and
Teucrium polium (60,17) that have been used for 
more than 2000 years as a treatment against 
overweight and obesity (17). Although, 
germander has been considered to be risk free, 
many cases of its hepatotoxic effect have been 
reported indeed (5,17,60,65). Teucrium polium￾induced hepatotoxicity has been observed in 
several cases as well (61,64,227-230). The 
mechanism of hepatotoxic action of germander is 
not well known. However, some studies may 
contribute to the hepatotoxic potential pointing to 
the furano neoclerodane diterpenoids constituent, 
found mainly in teucrin A (61,231). Accordingly, 
two cases reported that dual mechanisms- direct 
toxicity and secondary immune reactions- can 
mediate germander hepatotoxicity (60,232). 
Moreover, an immunoallergic mechanism may be 
involved and accounts for germander toxicity 
(17). Kava, obtained from Piper methysticum
roots, has been traditionally used for ceremonial 
and medicinal purposes and as remedy for 
insomnia and anxiety (68). The active constituent 
of kava is kavapyrones, which are responsible for 
the pharmacological properties (68,70,73). 
However, the first case report described the 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
391
hepatotoxic effect of kava was in 1998 (233). 
Consecutively, several case reports of association 
of kava consumption with hepatic injury have 
been reported (70,234). The spectrum of liver 
injury induced by kava ingestion includes 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure (68). Yet, the 
mechanism involved in kava hepatotoxicity has 
not been identified, however, immunoallergic 
reaction and metabolic idiosyncratic reaction have 
been proposed (70,235). Various risk factors may 
contribute to liver toxicity of kava including 
genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 
enzyme, co-medication, and existing liver injury 
(236). Moreover, Chelidonium majus or greater 
celandine is a well-known herbal remedy for the 
treatment of gastrointestinal tract diseases (81). 
However, Greater Celandine showed to cause 
several hepatotoxic events. The toxic constituent
of greater celandine responsible of hepatotoxicity 
is not yet known (136). Moreover, the exact 
mechanism of liver toxicity is unknown. Some of 
suggested mechanisms include an autoimmune 
mechanism due to the presence of eosinophilic 
infiltrates and autoantibodies in some cases. 
Another possible mechanism is idiosyncratic 
mechanism (13). Another dangerous herbaceous 
botanical is Atractylis gummifera, which has been 
commonly used in Mediterranean countries as 
antipyretic, purgative and diuretic (30,100). This 
plant is a life-threatening poisoning where all 
plant parts are toxic (240). Moreover, A. 
gummifera has been associated with several cases 
of hepatotoxicity including hepato-renal injury 
(89), hepatic necrosis (91) and death (91,95). 
Moreover, two main constituents are responsible 
for A. gummifera toxicity, which are
atractylosides and gummiferin. The proposed 
mechanism of A. gummifera-induce 
hepatotoxicity could be due to mitochondrial 
toxicity via inhibition of oxidative 
phosphorylation and induction of oxidative stress 
(95,100). Callilepsis laureola or Impila is another 
dangerous herb (97). It is a multifunctional 
remedy that used for treating stomach discomfort, 
cough, worm infection and impotence (97,98). 
However, Impila is a sever poison and patients 
poisoned by it show sever hypoglycemia (102). 
Moreover, several reports reported cases of 
hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity including acute 
renal failure (241), hepatocellular necrosis (98)
and hepatic and renal dysfunction along with 
hypoglycemia (102) as well as death (99). As in 
Atractylis gummifera, Callilepsis laureola
contains toxic atractylosides, which is responsible 
for fulminant hepatitis and renal tubular necrosis 
injury (101). Additionally, atractylosides act by 
inhibiting the oxidative phosphorylation (242). 
Chinese Herbal Medicine has been known for 
more than 4000 years and used as therapy for 
several illnesses (103). However, various 
hepatotoxic effects after consumption of Chinese 
herbal preparations have been reported (94). Jin 
Bu Huang is a common Chinese herb that used as 
analgesic, sedative and sleeping aid (30). 
However, JBH has been associated with acute and 
chronic hepatitis (105,107). Accordingly, the 
active component of JHB is the extract from 
Lypocodium serratum plant (94,106). The 
potential mechanism of liver damage induced by 
Jin Bu Huang is unknown (243). Additionally, Ma 
Huang derived from Ephedra sinica has been 
commonly used in China as a slimming aid as 
well as a therapy for cough and bronchitis 
(109,110,111). Several cases of Ma Huang 
hepatotoxicity have been reported 
(109,110,115,116). The major constituent in Ma 
Huang that is responsible for toxic effects is 
Ephedrine (110). The hepatotoxic action of Ma 
Huang could be immune-mediated (106,130,244). 
Another commonly used herb in China is Shou￾Wu-Pian, which is derived from Polygonum 
multiflorum (113,119). It is a mixture of Chinese 
herbs that has been used as a treatment for several 
illnesses including backache, constipation, 
dizziness, greying of hair, spermatorrhea, 
lumbago and treating symptoms of chronic 
prostatitis (120,121,122). Yet, Shou-Wu-Pian
found to cause acute hepatitis in adults and 
children (119,120,125). This hepatotoxic effect of 
The Shou-Wu-Pian is ascribed to toxic 
constituent, anthraquinone (120). Furthermore, 
the potential hepatotoxic mechanism of Shou-Wu￾Pian is not fully described (125). Another Chinese 
herb is Dictamnus dasycarpus, which has been 
used for treating skin diseases (127). Few reports 
reported hepatotoxic events and death associated 
with consumption D. dasycarpus with other 
herbal preparation (128,129,130,131). 
Additionally, Kampo medicine including Dai￾Saiko-to and Syo-saiko-to consists of mixture of 
herbs that has been used as a remedy of several 
illnesses like dyspepsia and pyretic diseases 
(10,133). However, these herbal medicine have 
been linked with some cases of hepatotoxicity 
(132,134). Accordingly, the toxic agents
responsible for hepatotoxicity of these kampo 
herbs are glycyrrhiza, and scutellaria constituents 
(132,133). Moreover, the mechanism by which 
these herbs induce hepatotoxicity is not fully 
understood (132). Another popular plant is 
Kombusha mushroom, which is not a true 
mushroom as it involves symbiotic yeast and 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
392
bacteria grouped together and surrounded by a 
permeable membrane (132). It is commonly used 
as health tonic to improve health (106). 
Nevertheless, several cases of toxicity have been 
reported due to intake of Kombusha tea (138). 
The potential mechanism involved in Kombusha 
toxicity could be attributed to usnic acid found in 
Kombusha. Thus, usnic acid can cause hepatic 
damage due to uncoupling of oxidative 
phosphorylation of mitochondria and induction of 
oxidative stress (106,113). Moreover, toxic action 
of Kombusha could be due to contamination if it 
is prepared in ceramic of lead containers 
(139,140). Cassia angustifolia or senna is a 
another common herb that has been used for its 
laxative properties (141,142). The leaves and 
fruits of senna have been associated with toxic 
hepatitis (143), acute hepatic failure (141), portal 
vein thrombosis (142) and subacute cholestatic 
hepatitis (144). The toxic constituent of senna is 
sennosides and anthraquinone glycosides 
(93,94,100,143). Moreover, the hepatotoxic 
effect of C. angustifolia is uncommon and could 
be due to exposure of liver to massive amounts of 
toxic metabolites of anthraquinone glycosides 
(141,142). Moreover, Pennyroyal oil obtained 
from Mentha pulegium or Hedeoma Pulegoides
has been used as abortifacient and pesticide 
against insects and fleas (145,146,149). However, 
several cases of pennyroyal oil intoxication have 
been reported (150) as well as cases of fulminant 
hepatic necrosis (149). The main constituent 
responsible of pennyroyal hepatotoxicity is 
pulegone and some other monoterpenes (149). 
The possible mechanism of pennyroyal causing 
hepatotoxicity involves the oxidization of 
menthofuran, which is pulegone metabolite, by 
cytochrome P450s (245,246). Moreover, the 
pulegone cause depletion of hepatic glutathione 
through formation of electrophilic metabolites, 
which increases the concentration of menthofuran 
leading to hepatotoxicity (149,247). Another 
common oil is Margosa or Neem oil extracted 
from Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Neem tree), 
which has been widely used to obtain good health 
and it is usually given to infants and children 
(151). However, several cases of hepatotoxicity, 
neurodeficit and renal tubular acidosis associated 
with Margosa poisoning have been reported 
(151,152,154,155). The toxic effect of Margosa 
oil has been attributed to the bitters constituents 
of this oil including nimbin, nimbidin, nimbinin 
and nimbidol (152). Accordingly, the potential 
mechanism of toxicity of Margosa oil could be 
due to toxic effect on mitochondria (155). One of 
most important herb involved in herb-drug 
interaction is St. John’s Wort (SJW) extracted 
from Hypericum perforatum (165). More than 
2000 years ago, SJW has been used as a remedy 
for several conditions but mainly as an anti￾depressant (156,157,158). It has been implicated
in interaction with various pharmaceutical 
(111,158,159,160). SJW-drug interaction can lead 
to serious consequences for example causing 
intermenstrual bleeding when taking with oral 
contraceptives, increasing total cholesterol levels 
and LDL cholesterol levels when taking with 
rosuvartatin, reducing plasma cyclosporine 
concentrations, acute liver transplant rejection 
when taking with cyclosporine 
(161,162,163,248). The responsible constituent of 
causing SJW-drug interaction is known to be 
hyperforin (156,157). Hyperforin causes 
induction cytochrome P450 enzymes level, 
particularly CYP3A4 and induction of P￾glycoprotein activity (249). Another hepatotoxic
plant is Valeriana officinalis or valerian that is 
available as a mixture with other herbs as over the 
counter medicine for the treatment of anxiety and 
insomnia (167). However, valerian has been 
associated with both cytotoxicity (250) and 
hepatotoxicity (168) with only few cases have 
been reported (251). Additionally, valerian has the 
ability to interact with other drugs and herbs 
(169). The main constituents of valerian are 
valepotriates (iridoids) and volatile oil with some 
other alkaloids (252). Moreover, alkylating agents 
found to be responsible for the toxic effects of 
valerian (168). The exact mechanism of valerian 
causing hepatotoxicity is unknown (166). 
However, one of suspected mechanism of toxicity 
involves hypersensitivity reactions (10). 
Furthermore, Viscum album or European 
mistletoe is a semi-parasitic woody perennial 
plant that is indigenous to Europe and Asia (170).
The leaves, berries and branches of mistletoe are 
used for treatment of different conditions like 
hypertension, asthma, infertility, insomnia, 
epilepsy, cancer and urinary disorders (30,171).
However, mistletoe found to contain toxic 
constituents in all plant parts like lectins (170). 
Some of side effects associated with this botanical 
involve fever, chills and headaches (170). 
Moreover, mistletoe hepatotoxicity is debated and 
only few cases have been reported (93,100,168). 
The possible mechanism of mistletoe-induced 
hepatotoxicity is unknown and no suggested 
mechanisms were found. Another commonly used 
herb is Scutelloria baicalensis or skullcap, which 
has been used as an anti-inflammatory, anti￾spasmodic and sedative agent and for treating 
arthritis, jaundice, cancer, hepatitis, epilepsy and 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
393
nervous tension (82,111,173,175,176). However, 
several reports reported cases of skullcap 
inducing hepatotoxic injury either alone or in 
compensation with other herbs such as mistletoe 
(172,173,176). Accordingly, skullcap contains 
terpenoid compounds, which are hydrocarbons 
that consists of isoprene unites. They are widely 
distributed in nature, particularly in plant 
kingdom as a constituent of essential oils in 
oxygenated derivatives form (10,113). The 
presence of terpenoid compounds in skullcap is a 
potential mechanism by which skullcap could 
cause hepatotoxic injury as well as veno￾occlusive disease (106). Moreover, NONI juice
from Morinda citrifolia fruit has been used for 
centuries as a Polynesian herbal medicine to 
maintain wellness (180,183). However, the 
consumption of noni juice has been associated 
with sever cases of hepatotoxicity including acute 
hepatitis (178,180,183), fulminant hepatitis (182)
and hyperkalemia in a patient with renal failure 
(253). The main toxic constituents of noni juice 
are anthraquinones involving rubiadin, rubiadin￾1-methyl ether, anthraquinone glycoside, 
moridone and nordamnacanthal that are known to 
cause hepatotoxic events (180,182). The exact 
mechanism of noni juice-inducing hepatotoxicity 
is unknown; however, potential hepatotoxicity 
could be attributed to the presence of 
anthraquinones (180). Rhein- a product of 
anthraquinone- cause intracellular glutathione
depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential
reduction, lipid peroxidation initiation leading to 
death of cell by production of oxygen derived free 
radicals through redox cycling (254). Amatoxin￾containing mushrooms like Amanita phalloides
can cause sever poisoning leading to death (94).
Several cases of Amanita phalloides poisoning 
have been reported (185,186,188). Thus, the 
toxicity is due to two toxins, which are phalloidin 
and α- amanitin. phalloidin is not sever toxin as it 
disrupts cellular membrane by irreversible 
polymerization of both G- and F-actin. Thus, 
phalloidin is only responsible for gastrointestinal 
symptoms (184,187). On the other hand, 
amanitins (α- amanitin) is the one responsible for 
sever toxicity of Amanita phalloides. It is 
absorbed in intestine affect liver (184). Amanitins 
causes toxicity by inhibiting the activity of RNA 
polymerase ΙΙ leading to interruption of protein 
synthesis and causing cell death (184,187).
Additionally, Sassafras oil extracted from 
sassafras albidum tree has been used as a remedy 
for several illnesses including urinary tract 
disorder and kidney diseases (145). However, 
sassafras showed to contain toxic safrole as its 
major constituent (192). Due to high 
concentration of safrole presented in sassafras, 
FDA banned intake of sassafras (145). Another 
hepatotoxic herb is Echinacea that belongs to 
North America and has been used by Plains 
Indians for treating respiratory infections and 
fever (194,195). Three species have been 
medicinally used including E. angustifolia, E. 
pallida and E. purpurea. However, the potential 
hepatotoxicity of Echinacea is linked with 
prolong intake of herb for more than 8 weeks as 
well as consumption of other hepatotoxic 
medications (193,194). Moreover, presence of PA 
could be associated with liver toxicity but it was 
reported that PA of Echinacea is lacking 1,2 
saturated necrine ring associated with toxic effect 
of PA (193,194). Additionally, the exact 
mechanism of Echinacea hepatotoxicity is not yet 
determined (193).
We reviewed and analyzed some of herbal 
preparations and their hepatotoxic effects; 
however, our review is limited due to some 
incomplete information regarding dosage of drug, 
duration of use, ingredients of plant and previous 
medical history of patients. Additionally, articles 
were restricted to English only and human 
studies/cases that occurred during 1900 to 2013
periods.
In conclusion, adverse serious events of 
hepatotoxicity were reported and evidence 
provides that herbs are not hepatotoxicity free. 
Botanicals are self-prescribed and widely 
available, which make them difficult to control. In 
order to minimize the harm of herbal products, 
patients should provide accurate information 
about their health and susceptibility to liver 
disease as well as complete details of their usage. 
Additionally, they should search for herbs that 
meet good therapy standards and follow 
recommended dose provided by their physicians
or pharmacists. Moreover, healthcare providers 
and physicians must report about all events 
associated with herbal use and advise about 
adverse reactions to such herbs worldwide in a 
common and accessible web-based database. 
Extensive education of practitioners, pharmacists 
and physicians about natural medicines is 
probably needed and this review intended to 
pharmacological scientists would be the basis for 
future seminars and workshops. Further research 
and studies are required in order to identify toxic 
constituents in each herbal preparation as well as 
possible mechanism(s)of hepatotoxicity. We 
would also suggest that (1) more scientific studies 
on immortalized normal hepatocytes are needed 
to identify toxic compounds and understand the 

J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci (www.cspsCanada.org) 16(3) 376-404, 2013
394
exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity; (2) a database 
with adverse effects of herbal products should be 
open and web details should be made accessible 
to general practitioners; and (3) seminars and 
workshops on herbal therapy should probably 
have experts in liver metabolism on board to 
explain hepatotoxic effects of alternative 
medicine.
