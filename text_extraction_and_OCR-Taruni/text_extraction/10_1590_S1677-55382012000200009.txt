INTRODUCTION
Lymph is the result of blood plasma ex￾travasation from the capillary vessels into the in￾terstitial space. Its role is related to the mainte￾nance of adequate human body organs and tissues 
perfusion and depends on the balance between 
hydrostatic and coloidosmotic pressures both in￾side and outside the capillary vessels (1).
 Lymphocele is a pseudocystic entity with 
lymph content covered with a hard fi brous cap￾sule. It can be a complication of any surgery in￾volving the lymphatic system. The term ‘‘lympho￾cele’’ (lymphatic collection without an epithelial

Objective: Lymphocele formation following renal transplantation is a frequent 
complication and may affect as many as 49% of patients. Operative treatment of 
symptomatic post transplant lymphocele (PTL) consists of wide drainage of the 
fl uid collection into the abdominal cavity by excising its wall, connecting the 
lymphocele cavity to the intraperitoneal space. Laparoscopic fenestration seems 
to be the best treatment as it combines satisfying success rates with a minimally 
invasive approach. The aim of the study was to review a single center experience 
on the laparoscopic treatment of symptomatic PTL and detail relevant aspects of 
the surgical technique.
Materials and Methods: The data of 25 patients who underwent laparoscopic 
surgical treatment for a symptomatic lymphocele following kidney transplanta￾tion were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data and surgical results were 
assessed. Detailed surgical technique is provided.
Results: Between 1996 and 2008, 991 patients received a kidney transplant at our 
institution. Twenty-fi ve patients (2.52%) developed a symptomatic lymphocele 
and laparoscopic drainage was performed. The indications for surgical drainage 
were graft dysfunction (84%), local symptoms (16%) or both (32%). The mean 
time until surgical therapy was 14.2 ± 6 weeks. Mean hospital stay was 1.5 ± 0.2 
days. Postoperative complications occurred in only 2 patients (8%) (one ureteral 
injury and one incisional hernia) and required reoperation. After a mean follow￾up of 36.2 ± 4 months, only 1 patient had a symptomatic recurrence.
Conclusions: Laparoscopic fenestration is an effective surgical technique to treat 
symptomatic lymphocele following kidney transplantation with low recurrence 
rate and long standing results.

lining) originated from the Japanese literature.
Medical and surgical factors are involved 
in the etiology of the lymphocele. The surgical 
factor appears to be the most important, special￾ly the lesion of the allograft´s lymphatic vessels, 
and also of the perivascular ones near the anas￾tomosis (2,3).
Liquid collections around the renal al￾lograft are very frequent and may occur in up to 
49% of patients. The significant majority of post 
transplant lymphoceles occurs within the first 3 
months after surgery (4). Although most collec￾tions are asymptomatic and resolve spontane￾ously, some may lead to more serious complica￾tions. Some of these patients may have general, 
vascular or obstructive uropathy repercussions 
that are secondary to the collection, and require 
early treatment to preserve allograft function (5). 
These repercussions cause symptoms that result 
from compression of the pressure created by the 
lymphocele on the ureter, bladder, or vascular 
structures, or from infection of these collections. 
Intervention is indicated when the compressive 
effect causes graft dysfunction or other symp￾toms including deep vein thrombosis, abdominal 
pain, or edema of the lower extremity and geni￾talia (6).
In this scenario, laparoscopy allows a 
minimally invasive approach combining image 
magnification, precise lymphocele drainage and 
minimal morbidity when proper surgical tech￾nique is implemented.
We reviewed our single center 12 - year 
experience with symptomatic post transplant 
lymphocele to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
laparoscopic procedure for this problem. A com￾parison with other centers results is provided.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
After approval by the Institutional Re￾view Board, 991 adult patients who underwent 
kidney transplantation at our institution between 
March 1996 and July 2008 were evaluated. The 
information regarding patients and associated 
surgical procedures were recorded.
In this study, only patients who presented 
either allograft dysfunction or local symptoms 
with perirenal and perivesical fluid collection sur￾rounding the kidneys or ureter were considered. 
They were observed through ultrasonographic 
evaluation in order to confirm the presence of 
lymph and the absence of urine. A sample of the 
fluid collection was acquired through ultrasound 
guided percutaneous puncture and sent for bio￾chemical analysis. Creatinine level similar to se￾rum confirmed its lymphatic nature. Computer 
tomography (CT scan) provided better evaluation 
of lymphocele collection and its anatomical rela￾tions to the surrounding structures.
All drainage procedures were performed 
under general anesthesia and a single dose of 
antibiotics (first generation cephalosporin) was 
given for prophylaxis.
A transperitoneal three-port technique 
was used. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained with 
CO2
 insuflation up to a pressure of 12mmHg fol￾lowing the insertion of a Verress needle through 
the supraumbilical crease. One 10-mm camera 
port was placed in the supraumbilical location 
followed by a second 5-mm working port along 
the mid clavicular line near the costal margin on 
the transplant ipsilateral side and a third 5-mm 
port in the opposite flank side.
The essential steps of the procedure in￾clude: identification of the limits of the lym￾phocele, laparoscopic needle aspiration for con￾firmation; and finally precise incision of the 
lymphocele cavity. The common wall between 
the lymphocele and the peritoneal cavity was ex￾cised with electrocautery after determining the 
location of the kidney and other vital structures. 
The fenestration created between the extraperi￾toneal space containing the transplanted kidney 
associated lymphocele and the peritoneal cav￾ity was made as large as possible but with great 
care to avoid the inferior and lateral peritoneal 
surfaces where the ureter and renal hylum could 
be accidentally injured. In this scenario, critical 
care was taken when performing the lymphocele 
wall incision (Figure-1). The cutting line was al￾ways longitudinal in a cranial to caudal fashion 
adding extra care to prevent ureteral and vascu￾lar injuries.
Patients were encouraged to ambulate and 
were started on a diet on the first day after surgery.

RESULTS
During the study period, 991 adult renal 
transplants (523 cadaveric, 468 living) were per￾formed (Table-1). The incidence of symptomatic 
lymphoceles was 2.52%. There were 25 lympho￾celes treated (14 women and 11 men). Preopera￾tive confirmation of the nature of the fluid col￾lection was obtained in all cases by percutaneous 
aspiration and fluid analysis including creatinine 
and cytology with differential cells and bacte￾rial culture. There was no evidence of infection 
in any case of our cohort. The indications for 
surgical drainage were graft dysfunction (21 pts. 
- 84%), local symptoms (4 pts. -16%) or both (8 
pts. - 32%) (Table-1). The mean time from trans￾plantation to surgical therapy for lymphocele 
was 14.2 ± 6weeks.
The operative time (including anesthesia 
time) was 88 ± 6 min. There were no intraopera￾tive complications and all cases could be com￾pleted with pure laparoscopic technique. Mean 
hospital stay was 1.5 ± 0.8 days (Table-2).
Clinical follow-up included serum cre￾atinine measurements and abdominal ultrasound 
after definitive surgical treatment. One patient 
(4%) developed symptomatic recurrence after 45 
days following lymphocele treatment and under￾went reoperation. An open technique approach 
was chosen in this case as technical difficulty 
was anticipated since the patient had had several 
abdominal surgical interventions other than the 
kidney transplantation and lymphocele drain￾age. Preoperative imaging allowed for location 
near to the graft hylum. Confirmation of prop￾er site was carried out only with palpation and 
careful aspiration. This patient underwent un￾complicated repeated fenestration without sub￾sequent recurrence. Two patients (8%) had post￾operative complications (one ureteral injury and 
one incisional hernia) that required reoperation. 
The patient with ureteral injury developed symp￾tomatic abdominal fluid collection one week af￾ter the procedure. In the reoperation, a lateral 
opening at mid third of transplanted ureter 1 cm 
away from the drainage incision could be noted. 
Correction was undertaken with ureteral edges 
revitalization and single stitches with absorbable 
suture. A double J catheter was placed under 
fluoroscopic control as well.
Incisional hernia developed 2 weeks af￾ter laparoscopy. An intestinal segment could be 
noted through the hernia ostium at the time of 
reoperation. All patients restored renal function 
after definitive treatment.
DISCUSSION
Perinephric fluid collections are common 
in the early postoperative period. Whereas asymp￾tomatic fluid collections do not require aggres￾sive diagnostic workup or treatment, symptomatic 
lymphoceles require definitive treatment (7).

84% of the patients of our series increased serum 
creatinine level was the first symptom indicative 
of a lymphocele. Lower extremity edema, genital 
edema, deep venous thrombosis before detection 
of the lymphocele were the leading symptoms in 
only 16% of the patients.
In our series of 991 patients studied over 
12 years, the incidence of lymphocele was 2.52%, 
which is comparable to the rate of 1% to 12% of 
patients observed in other reviews (8). The oc￾currence of lymphoceles after surgery for kidney 
transplantation does not seem to be the result 
of any single factor (9). A number of aetiologi￾cal factors are described and a large variety of 
combinations are likely to be causal (9). Like il￾lustrated previously there are good evidences 
to suggest that the extraperitoneal location of 
renal transplants and subsequent lack of com￾munication with the absorptive peritoneal sur￾face contribute to significant elevated incidence 
of lymphocele after renal transplantation. Other 
factors can contribute to lymphocele formation 
like delayed graft function (10), repeat transplan￾tation (11), acute graft rejection (12), cadaveric 
Symptomatic lymphoceles are of much 
less frequency but are easily recognized and 
diagnosed (8). When symptoms occur they are 
typically related to compression of adjacent 
structures. The most frequent symptoms asso￾ciated with lymphoceles are lower abdominal 
pain, lower extremity or scrotal swelling, deep 
vein thrombosis, or graft dysfunction secondary 
to ureteral or bladder outlet obstruction (1). In

donor kidney (3), sirolimus immunosuppression 
(13), and other host disease factors such as adult 
polycystic kidney disease (14).
Thromboembolic prophylaxis with low￾dose subcutaneous heparin can be another ae￾tiological factor. This may be a consequence of 
the higher vulnerability of the lymphatic system 
to the effects of anticoagulants due to the lower 
concentration of clotting factors and the lack of 
platelets (9).
Although it has been suggested that im￾plantation to the external iliacs is a risk factor 
for lymphocele formation, we routinely use the 
internal or external iliacs and did not find this to 
be a problem (15).
In this series, there was a significant dif￾ference in the number of lymphoceles in the 
kidneys from cadaveric donors. It could be ex￾plained by bigger inflammatory process in these 
patients, where surgery performed in urgency 
and not routinely like living donors.
Renal transplant recipients with increased 
serum creatinine levels and clinical symptoms 
indicative of a lymphocele should undergo diag￾nostic ultrasound or computerized tomography.
Before the laparoscopic era the only al￾ternative to open transperitoneal lymphocele 
drainage was percutaneous aspiration with sub￾sequent observation or sclerosant therapy. They 
introduce the possibility of infection and they 
can keep open lymphatic vessels due to continu￾ous aspiration (16).
Closed percutaneous drainage systems can 
be used for a defined period of time. They also 
carry a recurrence rate of 40-50%. A number of 
sclerosants have been used as an adjunct to percu￾taneous drainage (3). Although sclerosant therapy 
has a better success rate than simple aspiration, 
recurrences remain common, and complications 
including acute renal failure have been reported 
(17). No large series have established the benefit of 
one method of sclerosis over the others (4).
Operative treatment of symptomatic post 
transplant lymphocele consists of lymphocelec￾tomy with creation of a large internal window for 
intraperitoneal fluid drainage. Open lymphoce￾lectomy has long been the standard. A literature 
review including 129 patients who underwent 
open drainage between 1980 and 1998 revealed a 
complication rate of 4% and a recurrence rate of 
15% (18). It is believed that the high incidence of 
symptomatic recurrences following open drain￾age is a result of bowel adhesions obstructing the 
internal window and thus causing extraperito￾neal fluid accumulation.
Since laparoscopic fenestration of post 
transplant lymphocele was first described by 
McCullough et al. (19) in 1991, multiple groups 
have shown this approach to be safe and effec￾tive (4,6,7). The general benefits of laparoscopic 
surgery include less aggressiveness to the ab￾dominal wall with quick recovery, favorable 
cosmetics, reduced blood loss, low postoperative 
morbidity and short hospital stay.
The relative contraindications to a lapa￾roscopic surgery include bowel adhesions sec￾ondary to multiple previous abdominal surgeries, 
the need for a concomitant open procedure, and 
lymphocele anatomy in close proximity to the re￾nal hylum (6).
Since laparoscopy has been employed to 
treat post transplant lymphocele, a number of 
complications have been described (4,8). Injury of 
the urinary tract, particularly of the transplanted 
ureter, has been described as a major drawback 
of laparoscopic lymphocele drainage (4), and an 
incidence rate as high as 20% has been reported 
(16). Laparoscopic drainage of small lymphoceles 
in close proximity to the renal hylum bears an 
increased risk of iatrogenic ureter or vessel injury.
Recent reviews note different results with 
regard to complications associated with laparo￾scopic lymphocelectomy. Hsu et al., in a mul￾ticenter review of experienced centers, found a 
complication rate of 5% with only a single uri￾nary tract (bladder) injury (8). Cadrobbi et al. (20) 
found a 7% incidence of urinary tract injury (re￾nal pelvis, ureter, bladder) with laparoscopic fen￾estration, but the rate was lower in centers with 
significant experience.
Proper identification of the renal hylum 
and the transplanted ureter can be difficult dur￾ing laparoscopic fenestration. The successful use 
of intraoperative transcutaneous or laparoscopic 
ultrasound has also been described (4). The de￾vice seems to be a useful adjunct to identify

structures prior to fenestration and to document 
complete drainage of the fluid collection. How￾ever, the same authors admitted that this tool 
was not always helpful for identification of the 
transplant ureter. We believe that meticulous and 
careful procedure rather than the use of endo￾scopic ultrasound ensures safety during laparo￾scopic lymphocele drainage.
Laparoscopic drainage is thought to have 
a lower incidence of symptomatic recurrences 
compared with open drainage (10). In the litera￾ture the recurrence rate following laparoscopic 
lymphocele fenestration ranges from 4% to 6% 
(4,6,8). In our series, the recurrence rate after lap￾aroscopy was 4% (1 of 25). We believe that it was 
due to a failure to localize and adequately open a 
little inferior component of the lymphocele.
Based on our single patient with incom￾plete drainage of an unappreciated second cavity, 
we have begun to use laparoscopic transcutane￾ous ultrasound routinely if there is any question 
about lymphocele anatomy, in an effort to help 
prevent further recurrences.
Laparoscopic lymphocele drainage is a 
safe and effective procedure. Given the benefits 
of minimally invasive surgery, including reduced 
postoperative morbidity and shorter hospital stay, 
we conclude that laparoscopic drainage should 
be considered first-line therapy for patients with 
symptomatic post renal transplant lymphoceles.

Editorial comment
The authors present their experience on 
the treatment of 25 patients submitted to a kidney 
transplant with symptomatic lymphoceles. It has 
been observed a clear reduction of the incidence 
of lymphoceles in the last decade. There is not 
an isolate etiology for its occurrence. However, a 
careful dissection of the iliac vessels with careful 
taking to ligate the lymphatic vessels is certainly 
an important step on its prevention.
Before performing the laparoscopic drain￾age, some steps should be reinforced. A computer 
tomography is fundamental in planning the sur￾gery, the collection located lateral to the graft 
or deep in the iliac fossa may represent a ma￾jor difficult when performing the procedure. The 
authors have observed just one case of ureteral 
injury, probably in a patient with a lymphocele 
deep in the pelvis.
Another important aspect, mentioned by 
the authors, is to perform a percutaneous aspira￾tion one day before the procedure, to exclude an 
infected lymphocele. These patients may have an 
infected collection without any clinical signs.
The laparoscopic access is safe and effec￾tive for the treatment of symptomatic lynphocele 
as shown by the authors.
