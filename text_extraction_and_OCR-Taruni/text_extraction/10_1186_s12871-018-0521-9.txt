Abstract
Backgrounds: Arytenoid dislocation (AD) is a rare but severe complication after general anesthesia with endotracheal
intubation. We conducted a case-control study at Peking Union Medical College Hospital to identify risk factors
associated with AD, including the use of an intubation stylet.
Methods: Patients who experienced AD were matched 1:3 with controls based on gender, age and type of surgery.
Multiple conditional logistic regression was performed to determine associations between potential risk factors and AD.
Results: Twenty-six AD cases were retrospectively identified from 2004 through 2016. On average, arytenoid dislocation
occurred in 2 cases per year, with an incidence of 0.904/100,000 (approximately 0.01%). The 26 patients who experienced
AD and 78 matched control patients were enrolled in this study. All enrolled patients underwent endotracheal
intubation, and a stylet was used for intubation for 38.5% (10/26) of the AD patients and 64.1% (50/78) of the
controls (OR = 0.23, 0.07–0.74). A higher incidence of AD was significantly associated with longer duration of operation
(OR = 1.74, 1.23–2.47).
Conclusions: The use of an intubation stylet for endotracheal intubation appears to protect against AD. Prolonged
operation time increases the risk of AD. These factors should be considered when assessing the risks of AD associated
with endotracheal intubation and in efforts to avoid this complication.

Background
Arytenoid dislocation (AD) is a rare postoperative
complication after general anesthesia with tracheal in￾tubation [1]. The incidence of AD after general
anesthesia has been reported to be approximately 0.
01–0.1% [2]. The cause of AD may be inadvertent
trauma to the cricoarytenoid joint from the insertion
of airway tools into the larynx [3–5]. To our know￾ledge, no systematic investigations of AD associated
with tracheal intubation have been reported. Here, we
report a hospital-based, case-control study to identify
risk factors for surgery-associated AD.
Methods
This investigation was a retrospective hospital-based,
case-control study approved by the Peking Union Med￾ical College (PUMC) Hospital Institutional Review
Board. The study protocol was designated S-K260 and
was approved on May 11th, 2017. All the data were
collected from the adverse-event system in Department
of Anesthesiology. No written informed consent was ob￾tained from the participants. A verbal consent to partici￾pation in this study of each participant was obtained
through a phone call during follow-up, as all the partici￾pants had been discharged when we collected the data.
Patients
From January 2004 to December 2016, 26 cases involv￾ing postoperative AD were reported in the adverse-event
system. Patients were matched 1:3 (case:control without
AD) based on gender, age and type of surgery. We also

recorded the following information for each patient:
body mass index (BMI), surgical history, pre-existing
laryngeal disease, comorbidities, smoking and alcohol
history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
status classification, number of intubation attempts,
Cormack Lehane grading during intubation, intubating
tools, size of the endotracheal tube, duration of oper￾ation, postoperative admission to the intensive care unit,
whether a stylet was used to assist with intubation, and
preoperative baseline laboratory data.
Diagnosis of arytenoid dislocation
All the patients with AD appear some similar symptoms
within one week after the operations, such as, hoarseness,
choking when drinking water, and cough. Then electronic
fibro-laryngoscopy would be performed by attending
otolaryngologists to make the final diagnostic reports.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and
percentages, which were compared using chi-squared
tests. Continuous variables were summarized as means
± SD and compared using Student’s unpaired t-test. We
use Bonferroni correction on the top of simple multiple
t-tests to adjust the statistical significant level. Multiple
conditional logistic regression was performed to deter￾mine associations between potential risk factors and AD.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 287,767 cases involving surgery under general
anesthesia were recorded at our hospital from 2004
to 2016, with an average of 22,136 such cases per
year (Table 1). Twenty-six cases involving AD, an
average of 2 such cases per year, were recorded; thus,
the incidence of this complication was approximately
0.01% (0.904/100,000).
Table 2 lists basic information for the patients who
experienced postoperative AD. These 26 patients
included 14 males. Their ages ranged from 23 to 83
(54.0 ± 17.376) years. With respect to American Society of
Anesthesiologists physical status classification, 8 patients,
15 patients, 2 patients, and 1 patient were categorized as
class I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The types of surgery
performed included various extensive procedures. In
PUMC hospital, Macintosh direct laryngoscope is the pri￾marily routine choice for intubation, and the endotracheal
tube size is commonly ID 7.5 for male patients and ID 7.0
for female patients. All AD patients underwent tracheal
intubation, and among them only one patient received 3
attempts of intubation with Shikani optical stylet. Three
AD patients received a double-lumen bronchial tubes, the
rest 23 AD patients received single-lumen endotracheal
tubes, with none of them received a laryngeal mask air￾way. AD occurred on the left side in 15 patients and on
the right side in 11 patients. No patients in the both group
suffered pre-existing laryngeal disease or arthritis before
the operation. All AD patients recovered or improved
after reduction procedure.
Table 3 presents comparisons between the cases
and controls for numerous variables. The following
differences were statistically significant. Relative to the
controls, the AD patients had longer durations of
operation and longer postoperative hospital stays, but
less frequently underwent intubation involving the use

of an intubation stylet. The duration of operation was
4.03 ± 1.67 h for the cases and 2.60 ± 1.52 h for the
controls (P < 0.002). The two groups did not significantly
differ with respect to age; gender; BMI; depth of intub￾ation; frequency of postoperative admission to the inten￾sive care unit; rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
smoking, or alcohol use; or results for several preoperative
laboratory tests, including assessments of serum albumin
concentration, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin
time, and activated partial thromboplastin time.
Table 4 illustrates results from a multiple logistic regres￾sion model used to quantify associations between potential
risk factors and AD. Intubation with a stylet was associated
with a significantly reduced risk of surgery-associated AD
(OR = 0.23, 0.07–0.74, P < 0.01), and longer duration of op￾eration was associated with a higher risk of AD (OR = 1.89,
1.31–2.74, P < 0.01). Frequency of postoperative admission
to the intensive care unit, American Society of Anesthesiol￾ogists class III-IV status, BMI, and serum albumin concen￾tration were not significant risk factors.
Discussion
AD is a complication that is known to occur in all surgi￾cal departments, and factors that may either cause or
help to prevent AD should be considered. Our incidence
rate of AD (approximately 0.01%) is consistent with rates
reported by Szigeti et al. [1] and other researchers [2].
The primary finding of our study is that the use of an in￾tubation stylet was a significant protective factor for AD.
Although certain authors have reported possible disad￾vantages of stylet use, including an increased incidence
of postoperative pharyngeal pain [6] and an increased
frequency of sore throat [7] caused by removal of the
stylet. As a teaching hospital, most intubation attempts
were conducted by residents under 5 years, or even
medical interns, unless the intubation is too difficult. So
intubation with a stylet is strongly encouraged especially
for those trainees. The reason might be that stylet could
decrease violence of laryngeal scope during exposing
the glottis. An incidental but noteworthy finding of
our study is that all of the patients in the case group

underwent intubation; none of these patients received
laryngeal masks. Therefore, the use of a laryngeal
mask could be an approach for avoiding the occur￾rence of postoperative AD. In addition, we found that
the severity of a patient’s health status (specifically,
being ASA class III-IV) and BMI were not related to
the incidence of AD.
Another important finding of our study was that dur￾ation of operation was significantly longer for the AD
patients than for the control patients. Logistic analysis
showed that no stylet use and length of surgery were in￾dependent risk factors for AD. Other authors [8] have
reported that prolonged duration of anesthesia was a
significant risk factor for the occurrence of AD and sug￾gested that pressure exerted by a tracheal tube is a cause
of AD [8]. However, it is difficult to separate the effects
of stylet use and length of surgery. Another of our obser￾vations was that hospital stay was significantly longer for
the patients with AD than for the patients without AD;
we suspect that this difference is related to complexity
of the surgical procedure but not to stylet use.

We also found that compared with the control group,
the case group had significantly lower preoperative per￾ipheral red blood cell counts and significantly higher
white blood cell counts; however, the blood counts of
both groups were within the normal range, and logistic
analysis showed that neither of these counts was an in￾dependent risk factor for AD. Therefore, the significance
of these hematologic findings with respect to AD is un￾clear. Anemia or joint inflammation may lead to instabil￾ity [9], but it is not known whether either of these
phenomena is relevant to the cause of AD. The results
of several other common laboratory tests were also not
significantly associated with AD; thus, our study did not
identify a preoperative laboratory test that could predict
the occurrence of AD.
In our series, no cases of AD were recorded during
2006–2009. We suspect that the reason for this
phenomenon is that the Department of Anesthesiology’s
adverse-event system was improved after 2010, with bet￾ter follow-up of anesthesiologists’ performance. So there
should be some missing AD cases in the cohort, as is a
major limitation for our research. So we need to improve
our adverse event reporting system to achieve more
cases in future.
This study has some other limitations. For example,
this study was a retrospective case-control study and
may therefore have incorporated selection bias. Age,
gender and surgery department could not be analyzed in
this investigation. Secondly, since postoperative AD is a
rare complication, our case group contained only 26
patients. Large, multi-center prospective trials may be
needed to conclusively establish whether the use of an
intubation stylet protects against AD.
In conclusion, AD is a rare but severe complication
after general anesthesia. Use of an intubation stylet
appears to protect against AD, and longer duration of
operation favors the occurrence of this complication.
These factors should be considered when assessing the
risks of AD associated with endotracheal intubation and
in efforts to avoid this complication.
Conclusion
The use of an intubation stylet for endotracheal in￾tubation appears to protect against AD. Prolonged
operation time increases the risk of AD. These factors
should be considered when assessing the risks of AD
associated with endotracheal intubation and in efforts
to avoid this complication.
