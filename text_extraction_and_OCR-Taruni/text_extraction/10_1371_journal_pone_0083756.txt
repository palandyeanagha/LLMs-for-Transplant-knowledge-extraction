Abstract
Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and a risk
factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. Previously, we reported that dietary docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA, 22:6,n-3) was more effective than eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5,n-3) at reversing western diet (WD)
induced NASH in LDLR-/- mice.
Methods: Using livers from our previous study, we carried out a global non-targeted metabolomic approach to
quantify diet-induced changes in hepatic metabolism.
Results: Livers from WD + olive oil (WD + O)-fed mice displayed histological and gene expression features
consistent with NASH. The metabolomic analysis of 320 metabolites established that the WD and n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation had broad effects on all major metabolic pathways. Livers from
WD + O-fed mice were enriched in saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), palmitoyl￾sphingomyelin, cholesterol, n-6 PUFA, n-6 PUFA-containing phosphoglycerolipids, n-6 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids
(12-HETE) and depleted of C20-22 n-3 PUFA-containing phosphoglycerolipids, C20-22 n-3 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids
(18-HEPE, 17,18-DiHETE) and S-lactoylglutathione, a methylglyoxal detoxification product. WD + DHA was more
effective than WD + EPA at attenuating WD + O-induced changes in NASH gene expression markers, n-6 PUFA and
oxidized lipids, citrate and S-lactosyl glutathione. Diet-induced changes in hepatic MUFA and sphingolipid content
were associated with changes in expression of enzymes involved in MUFA and sphingolipid synthesis. Changes in
hepatic oxidized fatty acids and S-lactoylglutathione, however, correlated with hepatic n-3 and n-6 C20-22 PUFA
content. Hepatic C20-22 n-3 PUFA content was inversely associated with hepatic α-tocopherol and ascorbate content
and positively associated with urinary F2- and F3-isoprostanes, revealing diet effects on whole body oxidative stress.
Conclusion: DHA regulation of hepatic SFA, MUFA, PUFA, sphingomyelin, PUFA-derived oxidized lipids and S￾lactoylglutathione may explain the protective effects of DHA against WD-induced NASH in LDLR-/- mice.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form
of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is defined as
hepatic steatosis with inflammation and hepatic injury [1]. Once
developed, NASH can progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease [2].
Approximately 30% to 40% of individuals with hepatic steatosis
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83756

progress to NASH [2]; and the prevalence of NASH in the
general population ranges from 3% to 5% [3]. Given its
association with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic
syndrome (MetS); and its increasing prevalence and clinical
severity, NASH is quickly becoming a significant public health
concern. NASH is estimated to be the leading cause of liver
transplantation in the United States by 2020 [4].
The development of NASH has been proposed to follow a
two-hit mechanism [5]. The “1st Hit” involves excess lipid
accumulation in the liver, which sensitizes the liver to the “2nd
Hit”. The “2nd Hit” involves inflammation, oxidative stress, liver
damage and fibrosis. While the two-hit hypothesis is helpful in
understanding processes that contribute to development and
progression of NASH, our overall understanding of NASH is
incomplete and thus has limited the development of therapies
specifically targeted to NAFLD/NASH. The standard of care for
patients diagnosed with NAFLD or NASH is to treat for liver
disease and the associated co-morbidities including obesity,
T2D, hyperlipidemia, and MetS [1,6,7]. As such, a more
complete understanding of NASH is needed to address this
imminent public health burden.
We recently reported that the capacity of dietary
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6,n-3) to suppress markers of
hepatic damage (plasma alanine [ALT] and aspartate [AST]
amino-transferases), hepatic inflammation (C-type lectin
domain family 4-F [Clec4F], F4/80, toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4]),
oxidative stress (NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2, p22phox,
p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox), and fibrosis (pro-collagen
1A1 [proCol1A1], transforming growth-factor β1 [TGF β1]) was
greater than dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5,n-3)
using the LDLR-/- mouse model of western diet (WD) induced
NASH [8]. While dietary DHA provided significant benefit in
preventing NASH progression, neither EPA nor DHA fully
attenuated WD-induced hepatosteatosis. The outcome of this
study established that a major target of DHA in the liver is the
control of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, the key
features that distinguish NASH from benign steatosis.
To advance our understanding of both the progression of
NASH and the impact from EPA and DHA supplementation on
NASH, we conducted a non-targeted global metabolomics
analysis of livers from our previous study [8]. LDLR-/- mice were
fed the WD for 16 weeks with and without EPA and/or DHA
supplementation. A major advantage of this study was that it
provided an analysis of perturbed hepatic metabolism
associated with advanced diet-induced NASH, the most
clinically detrimental stage of NAFLD. Multiple studies have
previously employed lipidomic and proteomic strategies to
identify new NAFLD/NASH biomarkers [9-12]. Only a few
studies have used metabolomics specifically on liver to assess
changes associated with NAFLD or NASH [13-15]. As far as
we are aware, this is the first study to use metabolomics to
identify pathways involved in diet-induced NASH and also to
evaluate the impact of dietary EPA and DHA on NASH-induced
changes in hepatic metabolism. Our overall goal was to identify
pathways contributing to NASH and assess the impact of EPA
and DHA on the regulation of those pathways. Accordingly, we
identified several metabolic targets of WD and C20-22 n-3 PUFA
that potentially contribute to the development of NASH
including sphingo- and phospho-glycerol lipid metabolism,
membrane remodeling, oxidized lipid formation and
methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification. MG is a metabolite involved
advanced glycation end product formation and has been linked
to NAFLD [16].
Materials and Methods
Animals and diets
All procedures for the use and care of animals for laboratory
research were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Oregon State University. Male LDLR-/- mice
[C57BL/6J background, Jackson Laboratories] at 2 months of
age were fed one of the following five diets ad libitum for 16
weeks; each group consisted of 8 male mice. The control diet
was Purina chow 5001 consisting of 13.5% energy as fat and
58.0% energy as carbohydrates. The western diet (WD)
(D12709B, Research Diets] was used to induce NAFLD/NASH;
it consists of 17% energy as protein, 43% energy as
carbohydrate and 41% energy as fat; cholesterol was at 0.2%
w/w. The WD was supplemented with olive oil (WD + O), EPA
(WD + E), DHA (WD + D) or EPA plus DHA (WD + E + D).
Supplementation of the WD with olive oil, EPA, DHA or EPA +
DHA increased total fat energy to 44.7% and reduced protein
and carbohydrate energy to 15.8 and 39.5%, respectively.
Olive oil was added to the WD to ensure a uniform level of
energy from fat, protein and carbohydrate in all WD diets.
Preliminary studies established that the addition of olive oil to
the WD had no effect on diet-induced fatty liver disease in
LDLR-/- mice. The C20-22 n-3 PUFA in the WD + E, WD + D and
WD + E + D diets was at 2% total energy. A detailed analysis
and description of the diets was reported previously [8]. At the
end of the 16 week feeding period, all mice were fasted
overnight (18:00 to 08:00 the next day) then euthanized
(isoflurane anesthesia and exsanguination) at 08:00 for the
collection of blood and liver [17].
Urinary F2- and F3-isoprostanes (F2- & F3-IsoP)
After 15 weeks of feeding, 2 pairs of 3 mice from each diet
group were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hour urine
collections. Urine was stored at -80°C until analyzed for F2-
and F3-isoprostanes. Results were normalized to urinary
creatinine as previously described [17-19].
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from liver and specific transcripts
were quantified by qRT-PCR [8,20]. Primers for each transcript
are listed in Table S1. Cyclophilin was used as the internal
control for all transcripts.
Lipid extraction and analysis
Hepatic total lipid extracts were prepared as previously
described [8,20]. Hepatic polar and neutral lipids were
separated from the total lipid extracts by solid phase extraction
using established methods [21,22]. Briefly, an Alltech
aminopropyl disposable cartridge column was equilibrated with
2 column volumes of hexane. Total lipid extract in chloroform

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83756

was loaded onto the column and washed with chloroform.
Neutral lipids were eluted with chloroform-2-propanol (2:1).
Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were eluted with diethyl
ether-2%acetic acid. Lastly, glycerophospholipids were eluted
with methanol. Thin-layer chromatography was used to confirm
separation of lipid classes (Figure S1)[8]. Fatty acid methyl
esters were prepared from the polar, NEFA and neutral lipids
and quantified by gas chromatography [8,20].
Plasma Endotoxin
Plasma endotoxin was assayed using the Limulus
Amebocyte lysate assay procedure according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Charles River).
Metabolomic analysis
The non-targeted global metabolomic analysis was carried
out by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC). Briefly, the sample
preparation process was carried out using the automated
MicroLab STAR® system from Hamilton Company. Recovery
standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction
process for quality control purposes. Sample preparation was
conducted using a proprietary series of organic and aqueous
extractions to remove the protein fraction while allowing
maximum recovery of small molecules. The resulting extract
was divided into two fractions; one for analysis by liquid
chromatography (LC) and one for analysis by gas
chromatography (GC). Samples were placed briefly on a
TurboVap® (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. Each
sample was then frozen and dried under vacuum. Samples
were then prepared for the appropriate instrument, either
LC/MS or GC/MS.
The LC/mass spectrometer (MS) portion of the platform was
based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan
LTQ mass spectrometer, which consisted of an electrospray
ionization (ESI) source and linear ion-trap (LIT) mass analyzer.
The GC column was 5% phenyl and the temperature ramp was
from 40° to 300° C in a 16 minute period. Samples were
analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning
single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact
ionization. Identification of known chemical entities was based
on comparison to library entries of authentic standards. A
detailed description of this platform has been published
previously [13]. The metabolomic data is included as
Supplementary Information (File S1).
MultiExperiment Viewer (http://www.tm4.org) was used to
analyze and represent the metabolomic data as a heat map.
Detailed bioinformatic analysis was carried out using
MetaboAnalyst (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca). The original
metabolomics data was generated from analysis of mass
equivalent-samples. However, to account for differential cellular
protein content arising from the massive accumulation of lipid
in livers, the original data was normalized to protein
abundance/sample. In addition, gene expression data (delta Ct
values) from our previous study [8] was added to the
metabolomics data file. These transcripts serve as markers for
NASH and lipid metabolism and include: monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), cluster of differentiation 68
(CD68), NADPH-oxidase-2 (NOX2), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4),
procollagen1A1 (proCOL1A1), and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1
(SCD1). This analysis allowed us to visualize how metabolites
and NASH gene expression markers (transcripts) changed with
treatment. The metabolomic analysis (MetaboAnalyst (http://
www.metaboanalyst.ca) included several statistical analyses,
i.e., principal component analysis (Figure S2), volcano plots,
partial least squares-discriminant analysis, significance
analysis of microarray, empirical Bayesian analysis of
microarray, hierarchical clustering, random forest.
Statistical analysis
Changes in metabolites, proteins (immunoblot), endotoxin,
and gene transcripts were analyzed by one-way ANOVA to
detect significant differences between groups. Data were
analyzed for homogenous variances by the Levine test. If
unequal variances were detected, data were log-transformed.
ANOVA analysis was performed on both transformed and
untransformed data. A p-value < 0.05 was considered
significantly different. Values are reported as mean ± SD.
Results
Overview of diet effects on hepatic metabolites
LDLR-/- mice fed the WD + O for 16 weeks developed a
robust NASH phenotype characterized by hepatosteatosis,
hepatic damage (plasma ALT & AST), inflammation (MCP1),
oxidative stress (Hmox-1 and NOX2) and fibrosis (ProCol1A1).
While including C20-22 n-3 PUFA at 2% total energy in the WD
did not fully prevent hepatosteatosis, NASH markers of hepatic
damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, were
significantly attenuated. The WD + D diet was more effective
than the WD + E diet at reversing WD + O induced NASH
markers [8].
To gain additional insight into how the WD + O and dietary
C20-22 n-3 PUFA affected hepatic metabolism, we carried out a
non-targeted global metabolomic analysis using livers from our
previous study [8]. The analysis identified 524 total metabolites;
320 known and 204 unknown metabolites. When examined by
principal component analysis, the 320 known metabolites in
mice fed the chow diet had considerable variation in
composition, while metabolites in the WD + D group differed
from the other WD diets. Also, the WD + O differed from WD +
E and WD + E + D in the second principal component (Figure
S2).
A heat map of the 320 known metabolites is presented as
fold-change relative to chow-fed (control) mice (Figure 1). The
known metabolites were associated with 8 major pathways
including amino acid, carbohydrate, energy, lipid, nucleotide,
peptide, vitamins and cofactors, and xenobiotics; xenobiotics (8
metabolites) were excluded from further analysis. The analysis
revealed that metabolites associated with lipid and amino acid
pathways were most affected by diet (Figure 2A). Over 50% of
the metabolites in each pathway were significantly affected by
the dietary treatments. When compared to chow-fed mice, the
WD + O diet affected all pathways; suppression of metabolite
abundance was more common in the amino acid,
carbohydrate, energy, nucleotide, and vitamin & cofactor
pathways (Figure 2B). Dietary supplementation with EPA and

or DHA attenuated many of the WD + O-induced effects
(Figure 2C). Clearly the WD, without and with EPA or DHA
supplementation has broad effects on liver metabolism
affecting all major pathways.
Since feeding mice the WD + D was better than WD + E at
reversing WD + O effects on the liver [8], we prepared a
volcano plot comparing chow-fed versus WD + O-fed mice and
WD + O-fed versus WD + D-fed mice (Figure 3). Volcano plots
allow for the visualization of the distribution of p-values versus
fold-change for all known metabolites and selected RNA
transcripts [Tables S2 - S3 for the full volcano plot data].
Feeding mice the WD + O for 16 weeks led to an accumulation
of palmitoyl-sphingomyelin, MUFA (18:1,n-9 and 18:1,n-7), n-6
PUFA (20:4, n-6) as well as vitamins or their metabolites,
Figure 1. Heat map of diet effects on liver. The heat map
represents the fold-change for each metabolite relative to
control chow-fed versus WD-fed mice. The WD was
supplemented with olive (O), EPA (E), DHA (D) or EPA and
DHA (E + D). Results are sorted by fold-change within each
pathway.

including α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and 5-methyl
tetrahydrofolate (5MeTHF) (Figure 3A). Feeding mice the WD
+ O diet also lowered hepatic n-3 PUFA (EPA, DHA) and
oxidized lipids derived from n-3 PUFA (18-
hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid [18-HEPE] and 17,18-
dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [17,18-DiHETE]). Diet-induced
changes in hepatic MUFA, n-3 and n-6 PUFA content
paralleled changes reported previously using gas
chromatographic analysis of total hepatic fatty acid content [8].
Ingestion of the WD + O diet was also associated with the loss
of S-lactoylglutathione, a detoxification product of
methylglyoxal (MG); MG is involved in forming advanced
glycation end products (AGEP) [23] and promotes NASH [16].
These changes in hepatic metabolites were associated with
hepatic damage (ATL and AST) and the induction of multiple
gene expression markers of NASH, including MUFA synthesis
(SCD1), inflammation (MCP1, CD68, TLR4), oxidative stress
(HMOX-1 & NOX2) and fibrosis (proCOL1A1).
The comparison of WD + O versus WD + D (Figure 3B)
shows that many of the metabolites that changed in response
to the WD + O diet (Figure 3A) were reversed (partially or
totally) by the WD + D. For example, hepatic C20-22 n-3 PUFA
and their oxidized lipid metabolites increased, as did S￾lactoylglutathione. Hepatic MUFA, n-6 PUFA, n-6 PUFA￾derived oxidized lipids, palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and α￾tocopherol, in contrast, were decreased in livers of WD + D-fed
mice. Changes in hepatic content of these metabolites are

associated with a corresponding decline in the NASH gene
expression markers, i.e., MCP1, CD68, ProCOL1A1, NOX2,
SCD1 and TLR4.
Plasma endotoxin and hepatic palmitoyl-sphingomyelin
Monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP1) represents an
early and robust marker of inflammation; MCP1 mRNA was
induced >30-fold by feeding LDLR-/- mice the WD + O [8].
There are several sources of inflammatory signals that impact
the liver including oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) [24], endotoxin
[25,26] and products from hepatocellular death resulting from
hepatic injury [27,28]. In this report, we focused on endotoxin,
which originates from the gut either by increased gut
permeability or co-transport with chylomicron [26,29,30].
Plasma endotoxin of mice fed the WD + O is ~15-fold (p<0.05)
higher than mice fed chow (Figure 4). Plasma endotoxin is
well-induced in all groups fed the WD, regardless of the
absence or presence of dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA.
CD14 is the cellular receptor for endotoxin and it is linked to
toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) function [31]. Activation of TLR4
regulates a pathway that results in the accumulation of NFκB
(p50 & p65 subunits) in the nucleus. MCP1 is one of many
gene targets of NFκB [8]. TLR4 functions within lipid rafts,
membrane microdomains enriched in sphingomyelin,
cholesterol and phospholipids with saturated acyl chains [31].
Changes in hepatic palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated well
with hepatic MCP1 expression, hepatic total MUFA, palmitate
(16:0) and hepatic damage (plasma AST) (Figure 5 A-D). DHA￾and EPA-containing diets appear equally effective at reversing
WD + O-induced changes in hepatic palmitoyl-sphingomyelin,
MUFA, SFA and plasma AST.
Hepatic content of palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and metabolites
involved in sphingomyelin synthesis (sphinganine) and
ceramide degradation (sphingosine) were elevated in mice fed
the WD + O diet (Figure 6 A-C) suggesting effects on both
synthesis of sphingomyelin and ceramide degradation. We
examined the expression of enzymes involved in
sphingomyelin synthesis, including serine-palmitoyl transferase
long chain base subunit-1 & 2 (SPTLC1 & 2) and
phosphatidylcholine:ceramide choline phosphotransferase 1 &
2 (SGMS1 & 2) (Figure 6C). Of these, hepatic mRNA levels of
SPTLC1, SPTLC2 and SGMS1 were induced by WD + O. WD
+D, but not WD + E, blocked the WD + O induction of SPTLC1
and SGMS1, but not SPTLC2. While the involvement of
sphingolipid synthesis in the progression NAFLD has been
documented [32], this analysis suggests DHA modifies hepatic
sphingolipid levels, at least in part, by controlling sphingolipid
synthesis. We suggest these changes in hepatic sphingomyelin
alter membrane lipid composition and TLR4 signaling.
One-carbon metabolism
A key component of sphingomyelin is choline, an essential
nutrient (Figure 7A & B). Quantitation of metabolites involved
in choline metabolism showed that the WD + O diet increased
formation of phosphoethanolamine, choline, choline phosphate,
5MeTHF, dimethylglycine, cysteine, and cytidine 5’-
diphosphocholine (CDP-choline). EPA and/or DHA containing
diets attenuated the WD + O-induced changes in

phosphoethanolamine, choline phosphate, and 5MeTHF. One
explanation is that increased choline used for sphingomyelin
synthesis in WD + O fed mice was prevented by decreased
sphingomyelin synthesis in WD + D-fed mice.
Also quantified in this analysis are the oxidative stress
markers associated with this pathway; including reduced (GSH)
and oxidized (GSSH) glutathione and methionine sulfoxide. Of
these metabolites, only methionine sulfoxide was significantly
elevated in livers of mice fed WD + E and WD + D. These
results suggest that EPA and DHA have selective effects on
hepatic oxidative stress, affecting hepatic levels of methionine
sulfoxide, but not GSH or GSSH.
Saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids
(MUFA)
Hepatic SFA and MUFA content correlates with increased
palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (Figure 5). The WD contains high
levels of SFA and MUFA and feeding LDLR-/- mice the WD + O
diet leads to ~6-fold accumulation of 16:0 and >10-fold
accumulation of 18:1,n-9 and 18:1,n-7 in the liver [8]. The WD
+ O diet also induced enzymes involved in MUFA synthesis,
including SCD1 as well as two fatty acid elongases, ELOVL5
and ELOVL6 [8], suggesting that the massive accumulation of
MUFA was due to both diet and de novo SFA and MUFA
synthesis. The metabolomic analysis indicated that hepatic
citrate was elevated in livers of WD + O fed mice versus livers

of chow fed mice (Figure 8). Increased levels of citrate inhibit
phosphofructokinase-1, and therefore glucose-6 phosphate
levels trend higher in WD + O fed mice. Increased hepatic
citrate also supports increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL)
which leads to the accumulation of 16:0, 18:1,n-9, and
18:1,n-7. DHA-containing diets significantly lowered hepatic
citrate when compare to WD + O fed mice.
SCD1 is a key enzyme involved in hepatic MUFA synthesis
and its expression is regulated by multiple transcription factors,
including sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1),
carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP),
liver X receptor (LXR), and peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) [33]. Furthermore, regulation of SCD1
has been linked to SPTLC activity and has been implicated in
sphingomyelin synthesis [34]. We previously reported the
effects of a high-fat high-cholesterol diet and addition of C20-22
n-3 PUFA on SREBP1 and ChREBP nuclear abundance [17].
Here we show that SCD1 mRNA parallels the induction of
hepatic PPARγ2 mRNA and nuclear abundance in WD + O fed
mice (Figures 9A & B). None of the diets containing EPA or
DHA blocked the WD-mediated induction of nuclear PPARγ2.
Nevertheless, DHA, but not EPA, suppressed SCD1
expression. DHA is a robust inhibitor of SREBP1 nuclear
abundance [35]. Thus, DHA likely attenuates MUFA synthesis
by decreasing fatty acid synthase (FASN), ATP-citrate lyase
(ACL) and SCD1 expression. Taken together, these results
suggest that DHA-containing diets regulate hepatic 16:0,
18:1,n-7, and 18:1,n-9 content by controlling multiple genes
involved in DNL and MUFA synthesis as well as the availability
of substrates required for DNL. DHA suppression of DNL and
MUFA synthesis, however, is not achieved by suppression of
hepatic nuclear abundance of PPARγ2 (Figures 8 & 9).

Phospholipids and membrane remodeling
Feeding LDLR-/- mice the WD + O leads to a massive
increase in total hepatic fat, composed predominantly of SFA
and MUFA (Figure 10A). To examine the impact of this
massive change in hepatic fat on membrane composition, we
isolated hepatic phospholipids and examined the acyl chain
composition (Figure 10B; Figure S1). When expressed as mole
%, the sum of all SFAs in the phospholipid fraction was not
affected by diet. In contrast, WD + O feeding elevated the sum
of all MUFA in the phospholipid fraction by >100% (P < 0.05);
MUFA was decreased significantly by the WD + E and WD + D
diets, probably because of effects on DNL and MUFA synthesis
described above. The WD + O diet significantly decreased n-3
PUFA in phospholipids, while the WD + E and WD + D diets
significantly increased n-3 PUFA in phospholipids. The EPA
and DHA-containing diets significantly decrease n-6 PUFA in
phospholipids. Changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition
are illustrated in Figure 11. Fatty acids most affected by diet
were the MUFA (18:1, n-7 and n-9) and PUFA (20:4,n-6,
20:5,n-3 and 22:5,n-3). DHA in the phospholipid fraction was
only elevated by DHA containing diets.
The metabolomic analysis identified 42 lysophospholipids.
Lysophospholipids are generated during de novo phospholipid
synthesis or during membrane remodeling. Of the 26
lysophospholipids with acyl chains in the sn-1 position, 4 were
significantly affected by diet (Figure 12A). When compared to
chow, 1-oleoylphosphoethanolamine was increased ~3-fold
(p<0.05) in livers of mice fed the WD + O; the presence and

absence of C20-22 n-3 PUFA in WD had no effect on this
change. One-linoleoylphosphoinositol was decreased by ~50%
(p<0.05) by WD + E, only. Levels of 1-
arachidonylphosphocholine and –ethanolamine, but not –
inositol were increased by the WD + O diet, while diets
containing EPA or DHA decreased these lysophospholipids by
>50% (p<0.05).
Of the 16 identified lysophospholipids with acyl chains in the
sn-2 position, 4 were significantly affected by diet (Figure 12B).
Hepatic 2-oleoylglyceroethanolamine was increased ~3-fold
(p<0.05) by WD + O regardless of the presence and absence
of EPA and DHA, while hepatic levels of 2-
linolenoylphosphoethanolamine were suppressed >50%
(p<0.05) by WD + O. When compared to WD + O fed mice,
hepatic levels of 2-arachidonylphosphoglycerol-choline and –
ethanolamine, but not -inositol, were suppressed by >60%
(p<0.05). Hepatic levels of lysophospholipids containing DHA
were not affected by diet.
This analysis revealed significant changes in
lysophospholipids containing oleic, linolenic and arachidonic,
but not DHA. This outcome suggests significant changes in

either de novo phospholipid synthesis or remodeling of
membrane phospholipids. We examined the expression of
enzymes involved in membrane remodeling; including four
lysophosphatidylcholine acyl transferase subtypes (LPCAT1-4)
and two phospholipase subtypes (iPLA2γ and PLA2γ6) (Figure
13). WD + O induced transcripts encoding all LPCAT subtypes
(> 30%), while WD + D suppressed LPCAT1, 2, and 4
expression. The phospholipase, iPLA2γ, was unaffected by
diet, while PLA2γ6 was induced (~2-fold, p<0.05) by the WD +
O, regardless of the presence or absence of dietary C20-22 n-3
PUFA. Overall, this analysis showed that diet-induced changes
in hepatic membrane lipid composition are influenced by
substrate availability for membrane phosphoglycerolipid
synthesis, as well as changes in the expression of enzymes
involved in membrane remodeling.
Oxidized PUFA and lipid peroxidation
PUFA are sensitive to enzymatic and non-enzymatic mono￾oxidation (Figure 14). Enzymatic oxidation involving
cyclooxygenases (COX), lipooxygenases (LOX) and CYP2
family members requires excision of the fatty acyl chain from
membranes by phospholipases, while non-enzymatic lipid
peroxidation likely results from increased hepatic oxidative
stress affecting membrane PUFA. The metabolomic analysis
identified several oxidized PUFA generated from 18:2,n-6,
20:4,n-6 and 20:5,n-3 (Figure 15; Tables S2-S4). The
prostaglandin (PG), 6-keto-PGF1α, was only detected in WD +

O fed mice. This oxidized fatty acid is generated from 20:4,n-6
by the action of cyclooxygenase and other enzymes; it is a
degradation product of PGI2. 5-, 12- and 15-
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) are LOX products
derived from 20:4,n-6. The WD + D diet was the most effective
diet at suppressing WD-mediated accumulation of oxidized
lipids derived from n-6 PUFA.
Two n-3 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids were detected; 18-
HEPE and 17,18-DiHETE. 18-HEPE is derived from non￾enzymatic or LOX-dependent mechanisms and is a precursor
to resolvins [36]. 17,18-DiHETE is an epoxide hydrolase
product of 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EpETE);
epoxide formation is catalyzed by CYP2 family members. The
abundance n-3 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids paralleled
changes in hepatic EPA levels (Figure 15).
To determine if changes in the hepatic abundance of these
fatty acids are linked to enzyme expression, we quantified
hepatic expression of COX1 & 2, LOX-5, -12, -15, several
CYP2C family members as well as the soluble and microsomal

epoxide hydrolases (EPHX1 & 2) (Figure 16). Expression of
COX-1, COX-2, LOX-5 and LOX-15 were induced by the WD +
O and suppressed the WD + D diet (Figure 16 A). Hepatic
expression of several Cyp2C subtypes was suppressed by WD
+ O. In some cases, e.g., CYP2C29 and CYP2C37, WD + E
containing diets reversed the effects of WD + O on these
enzymes. Expression of EPHX1 & 2 subtypes was modestly
induced by WD + E and WD + D diets (Figure 16B). Changes
in the expression of the CYP2C and EPHX subtypes, however,
did not correlate with changes in the 17,18-DiHETE metabolite.
In addition to the C20-derived oxidized PUFA, several
18:2,n-6-derived oxidized fatty acids were detected, including
9,10-hydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10-DiHOME) and 9- and 13-
hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, i.e., isobar: 9-HODE and 13-
HODE. While 9,10-DiHOME is formed in the CYP2C/EPHX
pathway, 9-HODE and 13-HODE are derived through non￾enzymatic mechanisms. When compared to chow-fed mice, the
isobar representing 9-HODE and 13-HODE was suppressed in
livers of all mice fed the WD, regardless of the presence or
absence of C20-22 n-3 PUFA. 9,10-DiHome, in contrast, was
suppressed >80% in the WD + O group only. For many of the
oxidized fatty acids detected in the liver, the expression pattern
of the enzymes involved, e.g., CYP2C and EPHX subtypes,
does not parallel the hepatic abundance of the oxidized lipid
suggesting the formation of these oxidized lipids is driven more
by substrate availability than enzyme expression. Table S4
provides a correlation analysis between precursor and product
indicating a strong association between polar lipid fatty acid
availability and the hepatic abundance of the oxidized lipids.

Oxidative Stress and methylglyoxal metabolism
WD diets supplemented with EPA and/or DHA induced the
formation of methionine sulfoxide in liver (Figure 7), a cellular
marker of oxidative stress. We previously reported that LDLR-/-
mice fed high fat-high cholesterol diets supplemented with
menhaden oil had elevated urinary levels of F2- and F3-IsoP
and neuroprostane-F4 (NP4) [17]. These iso- and
neuroprostanes are derived from 20:4,n-6, 20:5,n-3 and
22:6,n-3, respectively. Herein, we quantified urinary F2- and
F3-IsoP. When compared to chow-fed mice, mice fed WD + O
had depressed urinary F3-IsoP, but no change in F2-IsoP
(Figure 17 A). Inclusion of EPA or DHA in the WD significantly
increased formation and excretion of both F2-IsoP and F3-
IsoP. These results are in agreement with our previous study
[17] and they indicate that dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA induced
isoprostane excretion, reflecting increased whole body lipid
peroxidation.
The metabolomic analysis showed that LDLR-/- mice fed the
WD + O had elevated hepatic α -tocopherol (vitamin E) and
ascorbate (vitamin C) [~7-fold, p<0.05] when compared to
chow-fed mice (Figure 17B). This increase was not due to
increased dietary vitamin E or C. In fact, vitamin E content was
independently quantified in both liver and the diets, and these
analyses indicated that the chow diet and all western diets
(WD) contained equivalent levels of vitamin E. When vitamin E
was normalized to hepatic triglyceride content (hepatic vitamin
E/mg triglyceride), hepatic vitamin E in the chow and WD + O
groups was not different. In the WD + C20-22 n-3 PUFA groups,
however, vitamin E was decreased by >60%. Thus, hepatic
abundance of EPA and DHA affects hepatic vitamin E and C

status. Since decreased hepatic vitamin E and C could
promote oxidative stress, we quantified the nuclear abundance
of nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a major
transcription factor involved in the anti-oxidant response
(Figure 17C). Hepatic nuclear abundance of Nrf2 was
increased ≥ 2-fold (p<0.05) in all mice consuming the WD,
regardless of the presence or absence of C20-22 n-3 PUFA. As
such, the WD induced an anti-oxidant response as reflected by
increased hepatic nuclear content of Nrf2. Changes in nuclear
Nrf2, however, do not parallel changes in hepatic vitamin C or
E.
While hepatic GSH and GSSH levels were not significantly
affected by diet, a glutathione metabolite was significantly
affected, i.e., S-lactoylglutathione. S-lactoylglutathione is a
detoxification product of methylglyoxal (Figure 18); and
methylglyoxal is involved in the formation of advanced
glycation end products (AGEP) and is implicated in fructose
induced NASH [23,37]. Increased formation of S￾lactoylglutathione is associated with more efficient
detoxification of methylglyoxal and decreased AGEP formation.

While the hepatic level of S-lactoylglutathione was depressed
by 83% (P < 0.05) in WD + O fed mice relative to controls, mice
fed the WD + C20-22 n-3 PUFA diets had ≥ 400% (P < 0.05)
increase in S-lactoylglutathione (Figure 18B).
Factors governing hepatic S-lactoylglutathione are
determined by substrate availability and enzyme activity
(Figure 18A). Two enzymes, glyoxalase-1 & -2, are involved in
the formation and degradation of S-lactoylglutathione.
Expression of neither glyoxalase subtype was affected by diet
(Figure 18C). Of the metabolites affecting methylglyoxal
formation [23], hepatic glucose falls and both 3-
phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate were increased in
mice fed the WD + C20-22 n-3 PUFA diets (Figure 19). These
outcomes suggest that dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA improves
methylglyoxal detoxification by controlling substrate availability.
Discussion
We used a non-targeted global metabolomic approach to
gain insight into mechanisms controlling C20-22 n-3 PUFA
attenuation of WD-induced NASH in LDLR-/- mice. Both WD
and dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA induced profound changes in
metabolites linked to all major hepatic pathways (Figures 1-3;
Table 1). In this report, we focused on changes in hepatic lipid,
amino acid and vitamin metabolism. The accumulation of
hepatic sphingomyelin, SFA, MUFA and n-6 PUFA, coupled
with depletion of n-3 PUFA, likely plays a major role in NASH￾associated pathologies, including hepatosteatosis,
inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. The capacity of
dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA to lower hepatic sphingomyelin, SFA,

MUFA and n-6 PUFA as well as lower hepatic nuclear
abundance of NFκB can explain many of the effects of n-3
PUFA on NASH-linked inflammation.
A major focus of our analysis was an assessment of
metabolic factors that contribute to hepatic inflammation. In the
WD-LDLR-/- mouse model of NASH, hepatosteatosis is
characterized by a massive accumulation of SFA and MUFA
and a significant accumulation of n-6 PUFA, palmitoyl￾sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Progression from
hepatosteatosis to NASH requires mechanisms that promote
inflammation and oxidative stress. Possible sources of
inflammatory signals in this model include the high cholesterol
diet which promotes high blood cholesterol levels [8]. This likely
increases the formation of ox-LDL; and uptake of ox-LDL by
Kupffer cells induces secretion of inflammatory cytokines [24].
A second source of inflammatory agents is endotoxin from the
gut [25,26]. The increase in plasma endotoxin may be due to
increased gut permeability or co-transport with chylomicron
[26,29,30]. The WD + O diet induces plasma endotoxin ~15-
fold (Figure 4). Whether this is due to loss of intestinal barrier
function or increased endotoxin co-transport with chylomicron
requires further study. Regardless of the cause, the cellular
target of endotoxin is CD14, the plasma membrane receptor
linking TLR4 to NFκB signaling. Once activated, NFκB subunits
accumulate in nuclei and induce the transcription of multiple
genes involved in inflammation, including MCP1 and TNFα, as
well as the induction of multiple cell-surface markers (CD68,
Clec4f, Clec10a, F4/80) on Kupffer cells and non-Kupffer
leukocytes infiltrating the liver [8]. Inflammation promotes cell
death, i.e., necroinflammation, cell debris accumulating from
dying cells promotes inflammation by activating TLRs and other
damage associated molecular pattern receptors associated
with inflammasomes; these events exacerbate the
inflammatory response [38].

WD + O induces several hepatic components involved in
TLR signaling, including TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, CD14, but not
MD2 or MyD88. WD + O also induced IL1β and the
inflammasome marker [non-like receptor protein-3, NLRP3 (not
shown)]. Dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA attenuated expression of WD￾induced TLRs and their components, plus IL1β and NLRP3 [8].
As plasma membrane associated proteins, CD14 and TLR4
function is governed by the composition of lipid rafts;
membrane microdomains enriched in sphingomyelin,
cholesterol and phospholipids enriched in SFA [39]. The WD +
O increased hepatic sphingomyelin 6-fold; this likely increased
membrane sphingomyelin and improved TLR4 activation of
NFκB signaling in response to inflammatory signals like

endotoxin. Increased sphingomyelin correlates with increased
sphinganine abundance and increased expression of SPTLC1,
2 and SGMS1. These findings suggest WD increases hepatic
sphingomyelin production.
Dietary EPA and DHA attenuates hepatic inflammation, at
least in part, by suppressing de novo SFA, MUFA, and
sphingomyelin production; this is achieved by suppressing
substrate availability (citrate) and the expression of enzymes
involved in these pathways (FASN, ACL, SCD1, SPTLC1,
SGMS1) (Figures 6, 8, 9). Increased C20-22 n-3 PUFA
consumption enriches membranes with n-3 PUFA and lowers
n-6 PUFA content (Figure 11). These changes are known to
disrupt lipid rafts [40]. Such changes in membrane composition
are also associated with suppressed TLR4 and nuclear NFκB
content in C20-22 n-3 PUFA fed mice [8,17]. While the effects of
EPA and DHA on NFκB nuclear abundance and inflammation
are well established [33], the impact of EPA and DHA on
sphingomyelin and membrane MUFA levels are novel. These
studies establish that neither EPA nor DHA affect WD + O￾induced plasma endotoxin. Instead, EPA and DHA attenuate
hepatic inflammation, at least in part, by inhibiting the cellular
response to the inflammatory stimulus, i.e., cytokines and
plasma endotoxin.
The second major focus of our analysis was the effect of diet
on hepatic and urinary oxidized lipids and markers of oxidative
stress. Our previous studies indicated that high fat-high
cholesterol diets induced changes in hepatic markers of
oxidative stress [8,17]; including Nrf2, GSTα1, HMOX1 and
components of the NOX pathway (NOX1, NOXA1, NOXO1,
NOX2, P22phox, P40phox, and P67phox). Oxidative stress has
been a target for therapy in patients with NAFLD/NASH; and
clinical studies have included both adults and children [41,42].
In the transition from the chow to the WD + O, hepatic
triglyceride, n-6 PUFA, cholesterol, α-tocopherol, ascorbate,
and Nrf2 nuclear content increase, while hepatic levels of n-3
PUFA, n-3 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids, and S￾lactoylglutathione decrease. GSH and GSSH levels were not
significantly affected by the WD + O (Figures 7, 15, 17, 18;
Table 1). In the transition from the WD + O to the WD + EPA
and/or DHA diets, urinary F2-IsoP, F3-IsoP and hepatic
methionine sulfoxide, S-lactoylglutathione, and n-3 PUFA￾derived oxidized lipids increase, while hepatic α-tocopherol and
ascorbate are decreased. Hepatic GSH and GSSH were not
significantly affected by the WD (Figure 7). Increased cellular
C20-22 n-3 PUFA promoted lipid peroxidation and thus
isoprostane formation (Figure 17) [17]. The decline in α￾tocopherol and ascorbate is consistent with increased lipid
peroxidation and isoprostane formation; α-tocopherol plays a
role in protecting cells from lipoperoxide formation; while
ascorbate, which is synthesized in mice, but not humans, plays
a role in α-tocopherol recycling [43,44]. More important,
however, is that the increased formation of n-3 and n-6 PUFA￾derived isoprostanes, methionine sulfoxide and S￾lactoylglutathione was associated with decreased gene
expression markers of NASH [8]. This raises the question of
whether n-3 derived isoprostanes/neuroprostanes and other
n-3 PUFA derived oxidized fatty acids are hepatoprotective.
Metabolomic Analysis of NASH in LDLR-/- Mice
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83756

Our studies also reveal a strong correlation between hepatic
content of EPA and DHA and the formation of 18-HEPE and
17,18-DiHETE. 18-HEPE is derived from EPA by a non￾enzymatic process or a LOX-dependent mechanism. 18-HEPE
is a precursor to resolvins, oxidized fatty acids with anti￾inflammatory pro-resolving activity [36]. The epoxide
hydroxylase product of 17,18-EpETE is 17,18-DiHETE; and
17,18-EpETE has recently shown to have cardioprotective
effects [45]. While the metabolomic analysis did not identify
17,18-EpETE, we have recently detected and quantified 17,18-
EpETE and 19,20-epoxy-docosapentaenoic acid (derived from
DHA), and the corresponding epoxide hydrolase-derived diols.
Using fractionated lipids (Figure 11; Figure S1) and LC/MS
methods, we have identified both epoxy- and dihydroxy fatty
acids derived from 20:4, n-6, 20:5,n-3 and 22:6,n-3. The epoxy
fatty acids are found predominantly in the phospholipid fraction,
while the diol fatty acids are found in the non-esterified fatty
acid fraction. Cellular levels of these oxidized fatty acids
parallel cellular levels of their precursors. Future studies will
require determining whether these oxidized fatty acids regulate
hepatic cell function.
Limitations and Conclusions
There are several limitations to our study. This research
used the LDLR-/- mouse and the WD to induce NAFLD/NASH.
While the relevance of this model to human NAFLD/NASH has
not been established, LDLR-/- mice have provided considerable
insight into processes linked to cardiovascular disease. NASH
development in these mice is similar, but not identical to that
seen in humans. For example, NOX4 induction is a major event
in human NASH-associated fibrosis [46]. NOX4, however, is
not induced by the WD in LDLR-/- mice. Instead, NOX2 was a
major NOX subtype induced by the WD in LDLR-/- mice [8].
This may reflect species differences in how the NOX pathway
generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, key factors in
oxidative stress pathways. While studies investigating DHA
supplementation in humans is sparse, we are aware of one
study where DHA supplementation had benefit against NAFLD
in children [47]. Several clinical trials are underway (6 clinical
trials are listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov), but none are
comparing the effects of EPA versus DHA on NASH
progression.
A second limitation is that the metabolomic analysis is
designed to detect small molecules. When these small
molecules enter other compartments, such as membrane lipids
like phosphoglycerolipids, they are not recovered by the
extraction methods used for metabolomic analysis. A case in
point is the analysis of epoxy and dihydroxy oxidized lipids
described above. The identification of 17,18-DiHETE in our
study, however, prompted further analysis to identify the
precursor to this fatty acid and to search for similar oxidized
fatty acids derived from ARA and DHA.
A third limitation is that the design of this metabolomic
analysis does not allow us to establish cause and effect
relationships. The goal of this study was to assess the breadth
of effects of the WD, EPA and DHA on hepatic metabolism. In
many cases we can relate changes in key pathways, e.g., fatty
acid synthesis and inflammation (MCP1), to the control of
specific transcription factors (SREBP1 and NFκB). Where there
was no information, e.g., sphingomyelin, oxidized lipids or S￾lactoylglutathione, we examined expression levels of enzymes
involved in these pathways. This approach allowed us to
determine whether changes in metabolites correlated with
corresponding changes in gene expression. While this
approach provides useful information, more studies are
required to further define the mechanisms leading to changes
in metabolites and expression of enzymes involved in these
pathways.
Despite these limitations, the outcome of our metabolomic
analysis established that the WD and dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA
have broad effects on hepatic metabolism affecting all major
metabolic pathways. Combined with our gene expression,
immunoblot and histological analyses [8], the metabolomic
analysis has provided an integrated view of the impact of diet
on NASH progression and prevention. Dietary DHA>EPA
attenuates NASH progression by regulating multiple processes,
including membrane sphingomyelin and phosphoglycerolipid
content, nuclear content of key transcription factors (NFκB,
SREBP1, NRF2 and others), expression of genes involved in
lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis,
improved glucose metabolism, and detoxification of
methylglyoxal. In addition, the EPA and DHA containing diets
increased the formation of several oxidized lipids that may be
hepatoprotective (epoxy- and/or di-hydroxy-fatty acid
derivatives of EPA and DHA) (Table S4). Mechanisms for EPA
and DHA control of membrane lipid content and the nuclear
abundance of the transcripts mentioned above have been
previously described[33]. The role EPA and DHA play in the
control of cellular levels of antioxidants like α-tocopherol and
ascorbate, and the role of n-3 PUFA-derived isoprostanes,
epoxy- and dihydroxy-fatty acids play in NASH progression is
novel. As such, more studies are required to establish how
changes in these hepatic metabolites impact NASH
progression. Methylglyoxal has been implicated in the
progression of NASH [16]. Fructose, a major carbohydrate in
the WD, promotes methylglyoxal formation and methylglyoxal
is involved in the formation of AGEPs. Finding that addition of
DHA to the WD improves methylglyoxal detoxification is equally
novel and opens a new window of DHA regulates carbohydrate
metabolism. Further definition of these pathways will help
explain the sequence of events leading to NASH and its
remission in response to dietary C20-22 n-3 PUFA.
