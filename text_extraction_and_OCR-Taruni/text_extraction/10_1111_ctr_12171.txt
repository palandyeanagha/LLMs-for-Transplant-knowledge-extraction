Abstract
Background—With the growing numbers of liver transplant recipients, it is increasingly
important to understand the risks of de novo malignancy after liver transplantation.
Aim—To characterize the incidence of de novo malignancy after liver transplantation compared
to a control non-transplant population.
Methods—We studied 534 Indiana state residents undergoing liver transplantation at our center
between 1997 and 2004, followed through August 2010 The incidence and predictors of
malignancy were determined. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of cancer in our cohort was
compared to age, gender and period matched state population using the Indiana State Cancer
Registry.
Results—After a mean follow up of 5.7 ± 3.2 years, 73 patients (13.7%) developed 80 cancers,
with 5 and 10 year incidence rates of 11.7%, and 24.8%, respectively. These included 24 (30%)
skin, 16 (20%) hematologic and 40 (50%) solid tumors. The most common solid cancers were
aerodigestive. Compared to matched state population, liver transplant recipients had significantly
higher incidence of all cancers (SIR:3.1, 95%CI:2.9–3.2), skin (melanoma) (SIR:5.8, 95%CI:4.7–
7.0), hematologic (SIR:7.1, 95%CI:6.3–8.0), and solid (SIR:2.7, 95%CI:2.5–2.8) tumors.
Conclusion—There is a significantly increased risk of de novo malignancies after liver
transplantation, highlighting the need for surveillance strategies in this population.

Introduction
Liver transplantation outcomes have improved over the last two decades due to improved
surgical and medical expertise and advances in immunosuppression. Liver transplantation is
also increasingly performed in older recipients.1
 Patient and graft survival rates exceeding
90% at one year have been achieved in many transplant centers. With improved long term
survival and an aging transplant population, there is increased likelihood of long-term
complications in organ transplant recipients. Late deaths and graft loss are less commonly
related to rejection or technical complications, and more to cardiovascular complications,
infections, disease recurrence and de novo malignancies.2–3
It is believed that the increased incidence of de novo cancers in liver transplant patients
occurs primarily as a consequence of immunosuppression which may affect tumor
development and progression by a variety of mechanisms. These include; providing a
permissive environment for malignant cells to proliferate, infection or reactivation of
oncogenic viruses within the host, chronic antigen stimulation leading to a cytokine-rich
milieu, and impairing immune surveillance.4–6 Some immunosuppressive drugs may also
influence the behavior of the malignant cells through intrinsic oncogenic properties.7
 Other
risk factors include exposure to antigenic stimulation by viral agents, alcohol and tobacco
use before and after transplantation, acute rejection episodes, type and doses of
immunosuppressive drugs and treatment with monoclonal antibody OKT3. 7
Previous registry based studies reported an overall incidence of de novo malignancies of
only 5.6 to 6.1% for cancers after solid organ and liver transplantation. 8–9 The reported
incidence after liver transplantation from individual centers varies from 2.6% to
21.7%. 10–14 The variation in rates of de novo malignancy in different studies may be
accounted for by differences in the duration of follow-up, geographic variation and
differences in methods of identifying and reporting of de novo malignancies.10–16
While there have been a number of U.S. centers reporting incidence of de novo malignancy
post liver transplantation, population controlled studies to define the relative risk of de novo
malignancy have been limited. A few, mainly European studies have analyzed the
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for de novo malignancy post liver transplantation by
comparing the incidence of cancers in single center or national liver transplant cohorts with
those of the general population from which the transplant cohorts are derived using national
cancer registries.9, 16–17
The aim of this study was to describe the incidence of and the risk factors for de novo
malignancy after liver transplantation at our center, and to characterize the standardized
incidence ratio of de novo malignancy in comparison to age and gender matched general
population in the state of Indiana.
Materials and Methods
Patients and transplant factors
The study was approved by the institutional review board of Indiana University
(#1011004298). A retrospective analysis was performed of all Indiana state residents
undergoing liver transplantation at Indiana University centers between the years of 1997 and
2004. Liver transplant recipients have at least annual clinical visits at our center after the
first year post transplant. Electronic medical records were reviewed to confirm their Indiana
state residence and to collect the following demographic and clinical characteristics: age,
gender, race, co-morbidities, personal and family history (first degree) of cancer, history of
significant alcohol use,18 tobacco use (current or previous), etiology of liver disease and

immunosuppression. The incidence of de novo malignancy was determined through review
of the institutional medical records and from the Indiana State Cancer Registry.
To avoid inclusion of undiagnosed cancers in recipients at the time of liver transplant, de
novo malignancies were defined as cancers diagnosed more than 6 months post transplant.
Since post transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) could develop within 6 months
of transplant all cases of PTLD were included as de novo malignancies.19 Recurrences of
known pre-transplant malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma were also classified
as pre-existing and not de novo tumors. Colonic high grade dysplasia developing in patients
with underlying inflammatory bowel disease was also classified as de novo malignancy.
Immunosuppression from 1997 through 2001 was based on cyclosporin with or without
prednisone, and since 2002 included induction with anti-thymocyte globulin and steroid free
maintenance with tacrolimus. 20 The calcineurin inhibitors were changed to sirolimus in
cases of renal dysfunction not responding to dose reductions and/or addition of second-line
immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or prednisone).
Discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors in favor of sirolimus in patients with de novo
malignancy may have occurred in some cases but was not uniform. Immunosuppression was
analyzed according to the primary immunosuppressive agent used (cyclosporin vs.
tacrolimus), and by the use of multiple agents (primary agent plus second-line agents,)
beyond the first year post transplant.
Analysis of the Standardized Incidence Ratio
The Indiana State Cancer Registry (ISCR) was used to identify de novo cancer in the
transplant cohort as well as matched control population. Controls were defined as age and
gender, matched individuals residing in the state of Indiana, with cancers reported during the
study period. As previously described, the ISCR identifies cases of malignancy (excluding
non-melanoma skin cancers not involving mucous membranes) through a variety of methods
including histology/pathology and radiology reports, diagnostic codes and death certificates,
with review and confirmation of all cases by a certified death registrar. 21 The ISCR
maintains a capture rate of approximately 95% of cancer patients in the state of Indiana.
The Indiana University liver transplant recipient study cohort was cross referenced with the
ISCR database to identify all reported cancers in the cohort between 1997 and August 2010.
Computerized probabilistic matching was performed by the ISCR to maximize sensitivity of
cancer reporting, and included the date of the registered malignancy, anatomic site,
histology and age at diagnosis. This process allowed for multiple tumors occurring in the
same individual to be reported by the ISCR. The development of de novo malignancy was
also determined by careful review of the medical record in all patients. All ISCR reported
cancers in the study cohort were confirmed by cross-referencing with the medical records.
Only cancers identified by the ISCR were used to analysis the SIR of de novo cancers in the
transplant cohort. Cancers were analyzed according to four main categories- all cancers
combined, hematologic malignancies, solid tumors and skin cancers (melanoma only).
Squamous cell cancer of mucous membranes were reported and included in organ system by
site e.g. squamous cell cancer of the lip would be included as oral cancer. Non-melanoma
skin cancers are not captured by the ISCR. The ISCR also determined the incidence of
cancers reported for the state population during the same period.
Cancer incidence in the study cohort was reported by the ISCR by age in increments of 5
years. Age-adjusted rates of de novo malignancy were calculated as the number of cases
divided by the population in each cohort multiplied by 100,000. Cancer incidence was
similarly adjusted according to gender. The SIR was calculated as the number of observed

cases of de novo malignancy divided by the expected number of cases based on the ISCR
incidence rate of cancers and person years of study population at risk. To calculate the SIRs
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, we used the Breslow-Day method and assume
a Poisson distribution and take the 97.5th, 50th, and 2.5th percentiles. P-values show whether
the ratio (comparing overall vs. Indiana rate) is significantly different from 1. SIR analyses
were performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).22
Statistical analysis
In the analysis of risk factors for the development of de novo malignancy and the effect on
patient survival, the endpoint was all cancers combined. Descriptive statistics were used to
characterize demographics and clinical data. Results are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation or median and range. Comparisons between patients with and without de novo
malignancy were made using the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and the
Chi-square test for categorical variables. As better survival has been reported for non￾melanoma skin cancers,23 survival and risk analyses were performed for endpoints of all de
novo malignancies with and without non-melanoma skin cancers. Estimation of survival was
performed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. P value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression
analysis was performed to identify predictors of de novo malignancies. Factors achieving a p
value of < 0.1 on univariate analysis were entered in multivariate backward logistic
regression model. Descriptive analyses, Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analyses were
performed with IBM SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA.).
Results
A total of 534 Indiana residents received liver transplants at our center from 1997 to 2004.
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in table 1. With a mean
follow up of 5.7 ± 3.2 years, 204 patients died, and 313 patients had complete follow up.
Seventeen patients (3%) were lost to follow up (after a mean interval of 4.8 ± 3 years).
During the study period 73 patients (13.7%) developed 80 de novo malignancies. These
included 66 patients with a single tumor and 7 patients with two tumors. The mean interval
from liver transplant to development of any de novo malignancy was 4±2.2 years. The
clinical characteristics of patients developing de novo malignancy and patients not
developing any cancers were compared (table 1). Patients who developed de novo
malignancy were older, were more frequently non-Caucasian, tobacco users, with a personal
and family history of cancer. Only 2 of 32 pediatric recipients developed de novo
malignancies (PTLD in both cases), with all other tumors developing in adult recipients.
Non-Caucasian patients comprised diverse races, and as a group were younger than
Caucasian patients (45±19 vs. 50±13 years, p=0.02), but had similar frequency of tobacco
use, personal and family history of cancer. Compared to Caucasians, non-Caucasian patients
had higher incidence of non-skin cancers 17% vs. 9%, p= 0.04), but similar incidence of
skin cancer (3% vs. 5%, p=0.4). Although men were more frequently transplanted for
alcoholic liver disease (29% vs. 13%, p< 0.001) and had significantly higher tobacco use
(42% vs. 23%, p < 0.001), there was no discernible gender-based difference in the incidence
of de novo malignancy in our cohort. A personal history of cancer at the time of liver
transplantation (including primary liver cancers in the explanted liver) was present in 17%
of patients developing any de novo cancer. However when excluding non-melanoma skin
cancers, 22.6% of patients had a previous cancer compared with 10.4% in patients without
de novo cancer (p=0.009).
Patients strictly taking tacrolimus or cyclosporin for the entire post-transplant follow up
period had an overall de novo cancer incidence of 15% and 19% respectively (p=0.4), but
those taking tacrolimus had a lower cancer incidence when excluding non-melanoma skin

cancers, 11% and 19% respectively (p= 0.09). The trend towards lower incidence of non￾skin de novo malignancy with tacrolimus vs. cyclosporin use was not specific to any cancer
subtype. The incidence of de novo malignancy in patients treated with sirolimus and in
patients not receiving sirolimus was identical at 15%, and excluding non-melanoma skin
cancer it was 12% and 7% respectively (p=0.6).
The most common malignancies were skin cancers accounting for 24 (30%) cancers, of
which 21 were non-melanomas, followed by 16 (20%) hematologic cancers, and 40 (50%)
solid tumors of which non-small cell lung cancer was the most common (Table 2). Twenty
one patients developed aero-digestive tumors, for which tobacco use is a recognized risk
factor (8 cases of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck and 13 cases of non-small cell
lung cancer). These cancers developed in 7.9 % of tobacco users vs. 1.5 % of non-users (p <
0.0001). Tobacco use was also associated with increased incidence of aerodigestive cancers
in patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease (7.1% of tobacco users vs. 2.5% of non￾users, P 0.3).
Cancer incidence
The cumulative incidence rate for all de novo malignancies was 1.3% at 1 year (number at
risk n=441), 7.2% at 3 years (n=391), 11.7% at 5 years (n=346), 17.9% at 8 years (n=118)
and 24.8% at 10 years (n=27) post liver transplant. The cumulative incidence rates for all de
novo malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers at 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 years post
transplant were 0.9%, 5.6%, 10%, 12.6% and 21.3%, respectively. The cumulative incidence
of de novo malignancy, including and excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, represented by
Kaplan Meier curves is described in figure 1.
The clinical chart review identified all but one cancer that was reported to the ISCR based
on autopsy findings not documented in our centers records. The ISCR captured the
incidence of de novo cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) in 48 patients in our
cohort (90% of the respective non-skin cancers in our cohort). Only the ISCR data was used
to analyze the risk of cancer incidence. On comparison with the state of Indiana population
controls, Indiana residents undergoing liver transplantation had significantly higher
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers, melanoma, hematological malignancies,
and solid tumors (p-values were < 0.001 for all comparisons) (Table 3). While we could not
control for a number of factors, according to the 2009 Census Report (http://
quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18000.html) and the 2009 Indiana Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance report (http://www.in.gov/isdh/reports/brfss/2009/toc.htm), the percentage of
Caucasians (84.3%) and lifetime smokers (>32.7%) in the state population were similar to
those of the study cohort.
Risk factors for de novo malignancy
The results of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of the predictors of de
novo malignancies including and excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, and predictors of
solid organ cancers are summarized in table 4. Older age was significantly associated with
increased overall risk of de novo malignancy. Non-Caucasian race was associated with a
significantly increased risk of de novo malignancy including and excluding non-melanoma
skin cancers on univariate analysis. However given the diversity of race subsets within that
group and the largely Caucasian cohort, race was not introduced in the multivariate analysis.
A personal history of cancer prior to liver transplantation was associated with significant
risk of de novo malignancy including (table 1) and excluding non-melanoma skin cancers.
The incidence of de novo malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancers was increased
in patients with primary liver malignancies (16.3% vs. 8.3% in those without history of any
malignancy, p=0.08), and in patients with a history of non-liver malignancy at transplant

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript

( 30.8% vs. 8.3%, p=0.007). Tobacco use was a significant predictor of non-skin de novo
malignancies on univariate analysis, but approached significance on multivariate analysis. A
family history was also predictive of de novo cancers on univariate analysis but not on
multivariate analysis. Other factors such as gender, alcohol or primary sclerosing cholangitis
as the etiology of liver disease and the type of immunosuppression were not predictive of de
novo malignancy. Age and tobacco abuse were the independent predictors of solid organ
cancers, and a personal history of cancer was only predictive on the univariate analysis.
Patient survival
We compared patient survival with and without de novo malignancy in patients surviving
more than 6 months post liver transplantation. By definition, no patients with de novo
malignancy died within 6 months of liver transplantation. De novo cancer related death
accounted for 29 (14.2%) of all deaths in our cohort, and 21% of all deaths in patients
surviving more than 6 months post liver transplant. Categorized cause of death in patients
surviving more than 6 months post liver transplant also included infection (15%), disease
recurrence (13%), cardiovascular events (9%) and other causes (31%). Post transplant
survival was significantly lower in patients developing de novo malignancy compared with
patients without cancer (70% vs. 81% at 5 years, p= 0.006). However patient survival was
diminished only in the subset of patients with de novo malignancy, excluding non￾melanoma skin cancer compared with patients without cancer (62% vs. 82% at 5 years, p <
0.0001). The cause of death in this subset of patients was the de novo malignancy in 83% of
cases, unrelated in 9% and unknown in 9%. One, 3 and 5 year patient survival after
diagnosis of any de novo malignancy was 65%, 49% and 36% respectively. One, 3 and 5
year survival were 100%, 100% and 67% in patients developing only non-melanoma skin
cancers, and 55%, 36% and 27% respectively in patients developing any other cancer (p <
0.001).
Discussion
The main findings of this study were the relatively high cumulative incidence rate of de
novo malignancy in liver transplant recipients and the significantly increased risk compared
to the age and gender matched control state population. A few U.S. centers have used multi￾state or geographically non-restricted cancer registry data to report relative cancer risks post
liver transplantation.12, 23 To our knowledge this is the first U.S. transplant center to use a
state cancer registry to determine the risk of de novo malignancy for a cohort of transplant
recipients relative to the state population from which it originates. It underscores the
importance of de novo malignancy as the leading cause of late mortality post liver
transplantation.
The overall SIR for de novo malignancy in our study (3.1) excluded non-melanoma skin
cancers which were not associated with increased mortality. It was comparable to SIRs
reported in European studies of similar design (2.1 to 4.3). 10, 16–17, 24–25 The overall SIR
for de novo malignancy provides a simple format for conveying the meaningful cancer risk
of long-term immunosuppression to patients requiring liver transplantation. The SIR for
solid organ cancers in our cohort (2.7) was identical to that reported by Haagsma et al (2.7),
but that was the only other study that reported this particular risk in liver transplant
recipients.17 Analysis of the SIR of individual cancer types was limited by our sample size.
The most common solid organ cancers in our study were non-small cell lung cancer and
squamous cell cancer of the head and neck accounting for 37% of all non-skin de novo
malignancies. Increased risk of aerodigestive cancers post liver transplant is well described
in patients with a history of tobacco use and alcoholic liver disease. 26–28 In our cohort
tobacco use was the more important risk factor, but this may be related to a proportion of

patients continuing to use tobacco post transplant, where as the majority of patients with
alcoholic liver disease would have maintained abstinence post transplant. Surveillance
strategies have not consistently resulted in diagnosis of aerodigestive cancers at earlier
stages, however it is prudent to maintain a high level of suspicion and consider surveillance
strategies that incorporate routine chest imaging and otolaryngology evaluation in patients at
risk. 29 Standard cancer screening surveillance strategies used in the general population
should, at a minimum, otherwise be followed.
It was not surprising that we found age and tobacco to be predictors of de novo malignancy,
particularly for solid organ cancers which were predominantly aerodigestive
tumors. 13, 17, 30–33 However, a personal history of cancer at liver transplantation was a
novel and strong predictor of increased risk of de novo malignancy in our study, particularly
for non-skin cancers, and is supported by data in kidney transplantation. 34–36 It is possible
that this factor represents a composite surrogate marker of an individual's propensity for
malignancy based on genetic and epigenetic factors. Non-Caucasian race was represented by
a small subset of patients with diverse races and therefore could not be appropriately
evaluated.
We analyzed the effect of immunosuppression on de novo malignancy according to the
agent used and the use of multiple agents. Cyclosporin has been the main agent used in the
majority of studies on de novo malignancy to date, 2, 12–13, 16, 33, 37. The present study, with
84% of the cohort using tacrolimus, is one of the few studies reporting on de novo cancer
with tacrolimus based immunosuppression.11, 23 There was no difference in cancer
incidence based on the calcineurin inhibitor used when analyzed by Cox regression which
takes into account lead time bias in patients on cyclosporin who longer follow-up time to
develop cancer. The use of sirolimus in our cohort included heterogeneous indications and a
limited number of patients, limiting meaningful analysis. Analyzing the effect of
thymoglobulin induction on cancer incidence was confounded by the concomittant protocol
change in primary immunosuppressant from cyclosporin to tacrolimus. It is likely that the
degree of immunosuppression itself that dictates the risk of malignancy. 38 Minimization of
immunosuppression has been shown to reduce cancer risk in renal transplant recipients, and
remains an important approach in mitigating the long-term risks of immunosuppression.39
The strengths of the study include; i) a large clinically well-defined cohort of Indiana State
residents receiving transplantation at the sole liver transplant program in the state, ii) a long
follow up period, and iii) the use of the ISCR to define the relative risk of de novo
malignancies. The limitations of this study include: i) a retrospective design, based on a
single center and the Indiana state population, ii) data on risk factors and cancer incidence in
the state population could not be validated, and iii) some ethnic/racial groups are not
represented well. Nevertheless the study highlights the increased risk and impact of de novo
malignancies in liver transplant recipients, and identifies novel predictors that may aid in
designing future surveillance strategies. A high index of suspicion and heightened
surveillance is warranted to effectively deal with this risk. More studies are needed to obtain
reliable data on cancer risk patterns, develop consensus on optimal monitoring of
immunosuppression, and develop cancer surveillance programs to improve long-term
outcomes.
