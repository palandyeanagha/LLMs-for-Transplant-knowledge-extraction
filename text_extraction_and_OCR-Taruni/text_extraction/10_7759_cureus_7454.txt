Abstract
Background
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of graft failure in cardiac transplant recipients.
Progression of intimal thickening noted during routine surveillance intracoronary imaging is associated
with the development of CAV. However, mechanisms of CAV development are poorly understood and targets
for therapy modification remain elusive. We investigated the association of neovessels (INs) within the
intima, noted by optical coherence tomography (OCT) during routine CAV surveillance imaging, with
intimal thickening and co-incident CAV.
Methods
Coronary angiography and OCT images of 45 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients undergoing
surveillance coronary imaging were reviewed. The presence of INs, defined as dark, tubular or rotund intimal
structures, measuring 50-200 µm in diameter, noted in at least three OCT frames, was quantified. CAV
diagnosis was determined by utilizing the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant classification
system. Demographic and clinical data was obtained by chart review. Significant associations between the
presence of INs and CAV, intimal thickening, and demographic features were evaluated.
Results
INs were observed in 22/45 evaluated patients (49%), while angiographic CAV was observed in 24/45
patients, with a significant association noted between the presence of INs and CAV (p < 0.001). INs were also
associated with increasing intimal thickness (p < 0.001), co-morbid hypertension (p = 0.010), and increasing
transplant age (p= 0.002) on multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
INs are prevalent in cardiac transplant recipients and are significantly associated with CAV, increased
intimal thickness, increasing transplant age, and co-morbid hypertension. Further investigation is
warranted regarding the temporal relationship of IN development and the onset of CAV, as well as the
mechanisms of IN development in this population.

Introduction
The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) reports that approximately 5,000
cardiac transplantations are performed annually at participating centers worldwide [1]. The long-term
durability of cardiac transplant is limited by immunologic graft failure, termed cardiac allograft vasculopathy
(CAV), which is a leading cause of death in cardiac transplant recipients who survive the first post￾transplant year. CAV is a complex, immune-mediated inflammatory process that results in endothelial
dysfunction and vascular injury. Diffuse fibro-proliferative concentric intimal hyperplasia ensues, leading to
compromised coronary blood flow and ischemia, resulting in graft dysfunction, arrhythmias and sudden
cardiac death [2].
Early diagnosis of CAV is challenging due to cardiac denervation leading to an absence of early clinical
symptoms of ischemia. Routine coronary angiography with intra-vascular imaging to monitor intimal
thickening has been utilized in CAV prognostication and is a mainstay of surveillance measures for CAV at
many transplant institutions [3]. Mechanisms of CAV development are poorly elucidated and adequate
targets for disease modification remain lacking.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a light-based intra-vascular imaging modality with 10 to 15-μm
resolution, accurately evaluating intimal thickening as well as delineating intimal structures such as
neovessels (INs) [3]. Neovessels have been well described in native heart atherosclerosis and have been
observed in accelerated CAV [1,4]. The role and incidence of INs in CAV, which may provide valuable insight
into delineating a multi-factorial disease process, have not been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the
prevalence of INs in cardiac transplant patients and their association with angiographically diagnosed CAV.
Materials And Methods
Patient selection and interventional technique
This analysis included a retrospective review of 45 cardiac transplant recipients undergoing routine post￾transplant coronary angiography and left anterior descending (LAD) vessel imaging with OCT between
March 2013 and June 2015. After completion of diagnostic coronary angiography and typically after
administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin (200-400 µg), a 2.7F OCT imaging catheter (Dragonfly-Duo, St.
Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was advanced over a guide-wire into the mid-to-distal LAD. OCT images were
obtained during continuous contrast injection (3-4.5mL/s, 12-15 mL total) at 300-500 pSI and 0 rate of rise.
The total scan length was 50-75 mm acquired at a rate of 100 frames per second at a pullback speed of
25mm/sec.
OCT analysis
OCT images were analyzed utilizing an offline review workstation (LightLab Imaging, St Jude Medical, USA)
in a frame-by-frame fashion jointly by two operators, assessing for both the presence and severity of
neovascularization within the intimal layer of the LAD. To distinguish neovessels from side-branches, an IN
was defined as a dark, sharply delineated tubular or rotund structure within the intimal layer, measuring at
least 50 µm, but no greater than 200 µm in diameter, and seen on at least three consecutive frames. For
neovessels seen traversing the media into the intima, a progressive decrease in size was required to be
classified as an IN. Maximal intimal thickening was measured utilizing the ruler too, from the lumen to the
internal elastic membrane.
Angiographic analysis
Angiographic analysis was completed by two independent observers, utilizing the ISHLT nomenclature
system to categorize disease as ISHLT CAV0 (no disease), ISHLT CAV1 (mild disease), ISHLT CAV2 (moderate
disease), and ISHLT CAV3 (severe disease). Discrepancies between observers in CAV Grade classification
were addressed by joint review, leading to consensus in all cases.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and co-morbid conditions were obtained by retrospective chart review. Patients were divided
into two groups: those with and those without the presence of neovessels. Demographics, traditional
clinical cardiovascular risk factors, transplant-related variables and medications, and echocardiographic
imaging data were compared using a one-way ANOVA for continuous parametric variables and Kruskal￾Wallis test for continuous non-parametric variables. Binary variables were compared across quintiles using
the Pearson Chi-Square test. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis.
Demographic and transplant-related factor-adjusted models were used to determine the risk of incident
cardiac allograft vasculopathy. SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York)
was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Participant characteristics and cross-sectional associations
OCT studies from 45 heart transplant recipients were included in the analysis. Among the population, 24 of
45 patients (53.3%) had incident CAV, most of which was grade I (Tables 1, 2).

hypertension, older transplant age, and higher maximal intimal thickness (MIT). However, neovessels were
not associated with other traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, prior stroke,
peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and immune-suppressive transplant medications.
Neovessels and incident CAV
Figure 1 shows a correlation of angiographic CAV with INs noted on OCT. There was over a 12-fold increased
risk of incident CAV with the presence of neovessels (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 12.8; 95% CI 3.1-53.2).
These associations remained significant, though slightly attenuated, in the demographic-, transplant age-,
and MIT-adjusted models (adjusted OR 7.8; 95% CI 1.3-49.1). Transplant age and MIT were independently
associated with incident CAV (p = 0.03 for both variables).

CAV, cardiac allograft vasculopathy
Discussion
Our study demonstrated: (1) INs, as visualized by OCT, are prevalent in heart transplant recipients; and (2)
INs are significantly associated with CAV, hypertension, increasing transplant age, and maximal intimal
thickness. In this analysis, we link intimal neovascularization observed by OCT to co-incident CAV,
establishing an association between IN visualization and clinical outcomes. Importantly, we also provide
further demonstration of IN associations noted in small series by other investigators [5-7].
Corroboration with prior series
In the largest study of prospective intravascular evaluation by OCT of cardiac transplant patients, Lerman et
al. reported a prevalence of INs of 46% at greater than four years post-transplant, comparable to the
prevalence in our series with a median transplant age of 6.3 years [5]. Ichibori et al. reported increased
intimal neovascularization at greater than 1-year post-transplant, which corroborates our finding of a
significant association of INs with increasing transplant age. We also similarly observed an association
between increasing MIT and the presence of INs (p < 0.001) [6]. We did not observe a significant association
between INs and recipient hyperlipidemia, diabetes or prior CMV infection, as described by other authors,
but did note an association with recipient hypertension [6,8]. Given that traditional coronary artery disease
risk factors and CMV infection are established risk factors for CAV, this discrepancy may be a result of our
small sample size being underpowered to establish an association with multiple demographic features.
CAV and intimal neovascularization
CAV is a fibro-proliferative inflammatory process associated with significant cardiac events and graft failure.
Landmark studies utilizing intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for surveillance in cardiac transplant patients
2020 Chahal et al. Cureus 12(3): e7454. DOI 10.7759/cureus.7454 4 of 6

have demonstrated that an increase of intimal thickness greater than 0.5 mm from baseline evaluation to the
first post-transplant year is associated with marked CAV progression and increased mortality [9-10].
However, advances in immune-suppression regimens since these studies have not led to improvements in
the incidence and rate of progression of CAV, leading to the desire for more sensitive markers of CAV which
could allow for earlier detection of the disease process [11]. OCT utilizes an optical analog of ultrasound and
provides ten times greater spatial resolution compared to IVUS, allowing for more precise measurement of
intimal thickening, as well as visualization of intimal structures such as neovessels and macrophages and
delineation of plaque components, with the potential to provide further characterization and
prognostication of CAV [5,12]. Our findings of a significant link between the observation of INs and the
presence of CAV substantiate this potential for earlier detection of CAV which may inform modifications in
immune-suppressive therapy to delay the progression of vasculopathy.
Intimal neovascularization is well described in native heart atherosclerosis, thought to be mediated by
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) activation in response to hypoxemia of the thickened intimal [13]. IN
development in cardiac allograft vasculopathy may similarly result after initial intimal thickening resulting
from immune-mediated endothelial insults. Ichibori et al. report a steep increase in intimal
neovascularization in the early post-transplant phase, 8 weeks to 12 months after cardiac transplantation,
suggesting that neovascularization may be mediated by an inflammatory post-transplant milieu [6].
Importantly, there is evidence to implicate neovessels in propagating vasculopathy, challenging their
presence solely as markers of disease or as a compensatory response to endothelial disease. One proposed
mechanism of neovessel-mediated plaque growth in ischemic atherosclerotic disease is through the
creation of a pathway for leukocyte recruitment and lipid leak into intimal plaque which leads to a cascade
of inflammatory immune responses with intimal proliferation [13]. Neovascularization has been directly
linked to plaque progression and vulnerability in native atherosclerosis [14-15]. Further, in a rat model of
cardiac transplant, administration of a regimen of TNP-470, an angiogenesis inhibitor, in conjunction with
cyclosporine post-transplant, interrupted progression of CAV [16]. The identification of neovessels during
surveillance imaging may thus provide both prognostic information as well as therapeutic targets in cardiac
transplant patients [17].
Our study is limited by a relatively small series of patients and the observational nature of the investigation.
Baseline OCT evaluations were not available for all subjects, thus pre-existing donor INs and intimal
thickening could not be accounted for. Long-term clinical follow-up data was not available; therefore, the
prognostic implications of observing INs outside of a link to the development of CAV could not be
commented upon. Finally, we could not account for the impact of included subjects having divergence of
immune-suppressive regimens over time.
Conclusions
In conclusion, INs are prevalent in cardiac transplant recipients and are significantly associated with CAV
and intimal thickening as well as demographic features linked with unfavorable outcomes post-transplant.
Further elucidation of the prognostic role of INs in CAV, as well as their role in the propagation of immune￾mediated graft failure, may provide a therapeutic target for this disease process. Prospective serial
evaluations would provide insight regarding timing and pathophysiology of the development of INs.
