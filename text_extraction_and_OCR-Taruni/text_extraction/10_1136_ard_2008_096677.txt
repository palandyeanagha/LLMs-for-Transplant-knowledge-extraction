ABSTRACT
Purpose: The optimal treatment of systemic sclerosis
(SSc) is a challenge because the pathogenesis of SSc is
unclear and it is an uncommon and clinically hetero￾geneous disease affecting multiple organ systems. The
aim of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR) was to
develop evidence-based, consensus-derived recommen￾dations for the treatment of SSc.
Methods: To obtain and maintain a high level of intrinsic
quality and comparability of this approach, EULAR
standard operating procedures were followed. The task
force comprised 18 SSc experts from Europe, the USA
and Japan, two SSc patients and three fellows for
literature research. The preliminary set of research
questions concerning SSc treatment was provided by 74
EUSTAR centres.
Results: Based on discussion of the clinical research
evidence from published literature, and combining this
with current expert opinion and clinical experience, 14
recommendations for the treatment of SSc were
formulated. The final set includes the following recom￾mendations: three on SSc-related digital vasculopathy
(Raynaud’s phenomenon and ulcers); four on SSc-related
pulmonary arterial hypertension; three on SSc-related
gastrointestinal involvement; two on scleroderma renal
crisis; one on SSc-related interstitial lung disease and one
on skin involvement. Experts also formulated several
questions for a future research agenda.
Conclusions: Evidence-based, consensus-derived
recommendations are useful for rheumatologists to help
guide treatment for patients with SSc. These recom￾mendations may also help to define directions for future
clinical research in SSc.
Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) affects the
skin and multiple internal organs leading, even￾tually, to fibrosis.1 The European League against
Rheumatism (EULAR) and the EULAR
Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR)
have acknowledged the need for evidence-based
recommendations to be used in clinical practice.
Following EULAR’s standard operating procedures,
an ad hoc expert committee was established by
EULAR and EUSTAR.2
The present recommendations discuss the drug
treatments, based on a combination of evidence
and consensus, which, in the opinion of the
community of SSc specialists (EUSTAR members
and invited experts), were considered most impor￾tant in the therapy of SSc. The appropriate
management of SSc patients is complex and
includes issues such as early diagnosis of internal
organ involvement, identification of patients who
are at risk of progressive disease and non-pharma￾cological treatments, all of which are beyond the
scope of this paper. Moreover, there are new
promising therapies, as well as some established
treatments, which have not yet been studied
extensively enough to be included in the present
set of recommendations but might be helpful in
individual SSc patients. Some of these treatments
are included in a comment section or research
agenda. The absence of a positive recommendation
cannot thus be taken as a recommendation against
use or that the agent has proved to be unhelpful/
dangerous.
The main aim of these recommendations is to
provide guidance to rheumatologists and practi￾tioners to approach and choose the treatment for
SSc patients. No recommendations regarding con￾traindications or what should not be done are
included for procedural and other reasons.
Likewise, cost considerations, despite their
importance, were not included in these considera￾tions, as costs vary widely across countries and no
uniform base case cost could be derived.
These recommendations are not meant to
replace the physician’s clinical judgement. They
should be viewed in terms of the clinician’s
understanding of the individual patient and the
clinician’s judgement of the balance between the
efficacy and toxicity of a treatment for a specific
person. Although some treatment-related toxicities
are mentioned in the text of recommendations
and/or in the following comments, this is the
responsibility of the physician to recognise and
monitor all possible toxicities/side effects accord￾ing to the information supplied by the producer
and all other available sources.
Throughout this paper, the specific recommen￾dation is followed by the evidence supporting the
recommendation. It should be realised that the
committee utilised the evidence in each case and
when evidence was not sufficient, supplemented it
by the consensus-derived expert opinion to arrive
at specific recommendations.

Consistent with EULAR guidelines for the generation of
recommendations, only data up to a defined time point
(December 2006) are included in the analysis. If new data
become available later, they will be included in the next update,
which is also a regular feature of EULAR recommendations.
METHODS
To obtain and maintain a high level of intrinsic quality and
comparability, EULAR standardised operating procedures were
followed.2 The detailed methodology for developing EULAR/
EUSTAR recommendations on the treatment of SSc has been
reported previously.3 Briefly, the task force included 18 SSc
experts from Europe (two of them paediatric rheumatologists),
the USA and Japan, two SSc patients from the Federation of the
European Scleroderma Associations (FESCA) and three fellows
for literature research. The preliminary set of research questions
concerning SSc treatment was provided by 74 EUSTAR centres.
After a process of aggregation and data reduction by a modified
Delphi technique, the experts selected the final set of 26
questions for the systematic literature research. Retrieved
clinical trial publications were evaluated using the Jadad
classification,4 and the level of evidence was graded from Ia to
IV.5 Outcome data for efficacy and adverse events were
abstracted and effect size (ES), number needed to treat (NNT)
and number needed to harm were calculated when appropriate.
RESULTS
Evidence-based approach
Out of 5421 publications identified, 281 were included in the
final analysis.
The methodology, including the selection of research ques￾tions and literature search strategy and the results of systematic
literature research are presented separately.3
Experts’ opinion approach
The final set of recommendations, grouped according to organ
systems and the future research agenda are summarised in
table 1 and box 1, respectively.
The evidence that there are few high-quality trials in SSc
prompted the experts also to include information concerning
the highest level of evidence based upon which a particular
recommendation was formulated.
Moreover, the experts decided to formulate, in addition to the
main recommendations, several comments concerning medica￾tions or therapies addressed in research questions, on which at
present neither literature-based evidence nor clinical experience
allowed precise recommendations to be made, see table 2.
All recommendations and appropriate comments were
accepted unanimously.
Final recommendations (propositions)
I. SSc-related digital vasculopathy (Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital
ulcers)
1. A meta-analysis on dihydropiridine-type calcium antagonists
and one meta-analysis on prostanoids indicate that nifedipine
and intravenous iloprost reduce the frequency and severity of
SSc-related Raynaud’s phenomenon (SSc-RP) attacks.
Dihydropiridine-type calcium antagonists, usually oral nife￾dipine, should be considered for first-line therapy for SSc-RP,
and intravenous iloprost, or other available intravenous
prostanoids, should be considered for severe SSc-RP.
One meta-analysis, including eight randomised controlled
trials (RCT; seven with nifedipine and one with nicardipine)6–13
with 109 SSc patients involved, indicates that dihydropiridine￾type calcium antagonists reduce the frequency and severity of
ischaemic attacks in SSc-RP.14 The weighted mean difference
(WMD) of all calcium antagonists versus placebo (six trials) for
the reduction in the number of ischaemic attacks over a 2-week
period was 8.3 (95% CI 0.9 to 15.7). When five RCT evaluating
nifedipine (10–20 mg three times a day) versus placebo were
analysed separately, the reduction was greater with a WMD of
10.2 (95% CI 0.3 to 20.1).
The standardised mean difference of all calcium antagonists
versus placebo (three trials) for the reduction in the severity of
ischaemic attacks was 0.7 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.2). Clinically, this
effect can be compared to a reduction in severity of 2.3 cm on a
10-cm visual analogue scale, or a more than 35% improvement
compared with placebo. Again, the effect of nifedipine alone
versus placebo (two trials) was greater (standardised mean
difference 1.0; 95% CI 0.2 to 1.7).
Two randomised placebo-controlled trials in patients with
mixed forms of Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) evaluated the
efficacy of diltiazem. Those studies, which were not in the
meta-analysis because they did not include an analysis on SSc
patients only, gave contradictory results.15 16
A second meta-analysis, which included the results of five
RCT with intravenous iloprost, one RCT with oral iloprost and
one RCT with oral cisaprost,17–23 with 332 SSc patients in total,
indicates that iloprost is effective in reducing the frequency and
severity of SSc-RP.24 Iloprost, given intravenously (0.5–3 ng/kg
per minute for 3–5 consecutive days sequentially) or orally (50–
150 mg twice a day) significantly reduced the frequency of
ischaemic attacks, and improved the RP severity score in
comparison with placebo (WMD 17.5; 95% CI 15.7 to 19.2
and WMD 0.7; 95% CI 0.3 to 1.1, respectively). Oral prostanoids
seem to be generally less effective than intravenous iloprost in
the treatment of SSc-RP, although some beneficial effects could
be seen with higher doses.17 19 24–27
Two RCT comparing intravenous iloprost (0.5–2 ng/kg per
minute for 3–5 days, every 6–8 weeks) with nifedipine (30–
60 mg/day) indicate that iloprost is only slightly superior to
nifedipine in improving symptoms of SSc-RP.10 28
In view of costs and feasibility, the experts recommended
that calcium antagonists are first-line therapy in the treatment
of SSc-RP. Intravenous prostanoids are recommended when
calcium antagonists have failed.
It should be recognised that, in addition to calcium
antagonists and prostanoids, there are many other therapies
that are in use for the treatment of SSc-RP, see supplement
available online only.
As both types of drugs may induce side effects of vascular
origin, the experts recommend particular attention if prosta￾noids are combined with calcium antagonists.
2. Two RCT indicate that intravenous prostanoids (particularly
intravenous iloprost) are efficacious in healing digital ulcers in
patients with SSc. Intravenous prostanoids (in particular
iloprost) should be considered in the treatment of active digital
ulcers in patients with SSc.
Intravenous iloprost (0.5–2 ng/kg per minute for 3–5 con￾secutive days) significantly reduced the number of digital ulcers
in comparison with placebo in one small RCT (Jadad score 3),
and improved digital ulcer healing in another RCT (Jaded score
4) including 73 SSc patients with active digital ulcers (p = 0.06
vs placebo for 50% improvement).21 22 In addition, two RCT
comparing intravenous iloprost with oral nifedipine suggest
that both medications have a beneficial effect on digital ulcer

healing, but the number of patients with digital ulcers in both
trials was small.10 28
Moreover, intravenous epoprostenol, administered continu￾ously for severe SSc-related pulmonary arterial hypertension
(SSc-PAH), revealed a tendency towards a reduction in the
number of new digital ulcers (by 50%).29
3. Bosentan has no confirmed efficacy in the treatment of active
digital ulcers in SSc patients. Bosentan has confirmed efficacy in
two high-quality RCT to prevent digital ulcers in diffuse SSc
patients, in particular in those with multiple digital ulcers.
Bosentan should be considered in diffuse SSc with multiple
digital ulcers, after failure of calcium antagonists and, usually,
prostanoid therapy.
Bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), was
evaluated in two placebo-controlled RCT (RAPIDS-1 and
RAPIDS-2) (Jadad score 5) involving 210 SSc patients in
total.30–32 Bosentan, at an oral dose of 62.5 mg twice a day for
4 weeks followed by 125 mg twice a day for another 12 weeks,
significantly reduced the number of new digital ulcers by 48%
compared with placebo (ES 0.4; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.8).31 The
efficacy of bosentan in preventing new digital ulcer formation
was corroborated by the results of the recent RAPIDS-2 study,
which was performed in SSc patients with active digital ulcers
(this is a population considered to be at high risk of peripheral
digital necrosis) (mean placebo-adjusted improvement 0.7 (39%)
and 0.8 (30%) new ulcers per patient over 12 and 24 weeks,
respectively; p,0.05 vs placebo for both comparisons).31 32 Post￾hoc subgroup analysis of RAPIDS-1 suggested that the highest
effect of bosentan was found in diffuse SSc (61% reduction over
16 weeks; p = 0.011 vs placebo), especially in diffuse SSc with
active digital ulcers (67%; p,0.001 vs placebo), whereas in
limited SSc the mean reduction was 38% when considering the
entire population and 30% if limited to patients with active
digital ulcers.30 It is anticipated that the results of RAPIDS-2,
when published, will add new information concerning the
efficacy of bosentan in the prevention of digital ulcers in SSc
subsets.
Neither trial indicated that bosentan is superior to placebo in
the healing of SSc-related active digital ulcers, as evaluated by
the time to complete or partial healing of digital ulcers present
at baseline, the time to healing of all digital ulcers, or the
percentage of patients with complete digital ulcer healing
(p.0.05 vs placebo for all comparisons).30–32 The beneficial
effect on new digital ulcer formation was accompanied by a
significant improvement in overall hand function (specific
health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score ES 0.4; 95% CI
0.0 to 0.8) in RAPIDS-1, and a significant improvement in the
Scleroderma-HAQ dressing domain (p = 0.03) in RAPIDS-2.
As discussed above, intravenous iloprost and epoprostenol
were shown to improve the healing of active digital
ulcers.10 21 22 28 29 Calcium antagonists, efficacious in the treat￾ment of SSc-RP, have been studied less extensively with respect
to the prevention and healing of digital ulcers in SSc. The results
of two RCT, with low numbers of patients with digital ulcers,
suggest a comparable efficacy of calcium antagonists and
intravenous iloprost in healing active digital ulcers in SSc.10 28
In a small RCT with 10 SSc patients, nifedipine (30 mg/day)
reduced both the number of patients with new digital ulcers and
the total number of new digital ulcers by 50% compared with
placebo over a 6-week period (NNT 3.3 for preventing new
digital ulcers).12 The available evidence concerning calcium
antagonists and prostanoids in the prevention of new digital
ulcers in SSc patients is far less comprehensive and robust than
that of bosentan, but their toxicity pattern is milder, and long￾term clinical experience suggests a good safety profile.
There are two major concerns related to the use of bosentan
and other ERA: potential liver injury and teratogenicity.33 34
Hormonal contraceptives may not be reliable if co-administered
with bosentan, because bosentan may reduce their efficacy by
interference with the cytochrome P450 system.35
II. SSc-PAH
4. Two high-quality RCT indicate that bosentan improves
exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Bosentan
should be strongly considered to treat SSc-PAH.
The efficacy of ERA in the treatment of PAH was analysed in
a meta-analysis of four RCT evaluating bosentan and one RCT
evaluating sitaxentan36–41 (see supplementary material available
online only). The results of this meta-analysis refer mainly to
patients with idiopathic PAH, who constituted the vast
majority (mean 67%, range 53–89%) of patients recruited in
the studies analysed. In SSc-PAH, known to have a worse
prognosis than idiopathic PAH, only bosentan has been studied
extensively, including data concerning survival in SSc-PAH
patients exclusively.
Two high-quality (Jadad score 5) placebo-controlled RCT
showed that bosentan (62.5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks,
followed by 125–250 mg twice a day) significantly improved the
6-minute walk test (6MWT) after 12 and 16 weeks in a
heterogeneous population of PAH patients, see supplementary
table 3 available online only.36 37 An improvement in exercise
capacity coincided with an improvement in the New York
Heart Association (NYHA)/World Health Organization (WHO)
functional class (NNT 3 and NNT 7.7 to 14.3, respectively),
dyspnoea score (ES 1.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9 and ES 4.5; 95% CI 3.8
to 5.1 for bosentan dosages of 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day,
respectively) and haemodynamic measures, see supplementary
table 3 available online only.36 37 42
A subanalysis of 66 patients with connective tissue disease
(CTD)-related PAH (CTD-PAH) included in the above two
RCT (79% were SSc patients) revealed a placebo-adjusted
improvement in 6MWT of 22 m in favour of bosentan (ES 0.3;
95% CI 20.2 to 0.8).43
Analysis of the two pivotal RCT and their long-term
extension studies suggested that bosentan may improve survival
in SSc-PAH in comparison with historic controls (1, 2 and 3-year
survival 82%, 67% and 64%, respectively, vs 45%, 35% and
28%).44 Similarly, Williams et al45 demonstrated that SSc-PAH
patients receiving bosentan (in addition to standard therapy
consisting of diuretics, digoxin, oxygen, warfarin and, if
clinically indicated, prostanoids) had a significantly better
survival (81% at 1 year, 71% at 2 years) than a historic
comparator group of SSc-PAH patients treated with standard
therapy including prostanoids (survival 68% and 47% at 1 and
2 years, respectively; p = 0.016).
On the basis of the results of RCT, bosentan was
recommended in the current guidelines of the American
College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) for the treatment of severe
PAH (WHO class III/IV).46
5. Two high-quality RCT indicate that sitaxentan improves
exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in PAH. At present, sitaxentan may also be considered
to treat SSc-PAH.
Two high-quality (Jadad score 4) RCT (STRIDE-1 and
STRIDE-2) including 423 patients with different forms of
PAH, among which 63 (15%) had SSc-PAH, indicate that

sitaxentan (a selective ETA endothelin receptor antagonist),
administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/day and 300 mg/day for
12 to 18 weeks, significantly improved exercise capacity and
haemodynamics,39 47 see supplementary table 3 available online
only. Accordingly, sitaxentan (100 mg/day and 300 mg/day)
improved NYHA functional class compared with placebo (NNT
7 for both doses assessed over 12 weeks).39 The improvement
was even greater in a STRIDE-1 subgroup of PAH patients being
in WHO class III or IV, suggesting that patients with more
severe PAH may achieve the greatest benefit from sitaxentan
therapy,48 see supplementary table 3 available online only. In
view of the comparable efficacy of the two sitaxentan regimens
and the fact that the higher dose was associated with greater
toxicity (discussed below), sitaxentan at a dose of 100 mg/day is
suggested in the treatment of PAH.
No studies or specific subgroup analyses investigating the
efficacy of sitaxentan in SSc-PAH have been published. A
subanalysis of both pivotal trials combining the 110 patients
with CTD-PAH, of whom 63 (57%) had SSc-PAH, showed that
100 mg/day revealed a similar improvement in the 6MWT as in
the overall STRIDE-1 study population (ES 0.3; 95% CI 20.2 to
0.8 for sitaxentan vs placebo).49 One-year survival in 42 CTD￾PAH patients receiving sitaxentan in open-label studies was
significantly better than in 25 CTD-PAH patients treated with
bosentan (98% vs 79%; p,0.001), although the effects on
6MWT and functional class were not different comparing the
two drugs.50
In view of its comparable efficacy and its similar toxicity
profile, experts considered sitaxsentan as an alternative for
bosentan in patients with SSc-PAH. An open-label extension of
STRIDE-2 suggested that sitaxentan (100 mg/day) may be safer
than bosentan (250 mg/day) with regard to the frequency of
liver test abnormalities (3% of the sitaxentan group vs 18% of
the bosentan group; p,0.03) and premature discontinuation,
either related to hepatotoxicity (0% vs 14% for sitaxentan vs
bosentan) or overall (20% vs 57% for sitaxentan vs bosentan;
p,0.001).50 Moreover, sitaxentan 100 mg/day improved the
clinical status in more than one-third of PAH patients in whom
bosentan was ineffective.51
Sitaxentan, as other ERA, is potentially teratogenic and may
reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptive therapy.
6. One high-quality RCT indicates that sildenafil improves
exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in PAH.
Sildenafil may be considered to treat SSc-PAH.
One high-quality RCT (Jadad score 5) has demonstrated that
sildenafil (a selective type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor), given
orally at a dose of 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg three times a day,
significantly improved the 6MWT result, functional class and
haemodynamics over a 12-week period in PAH of different
origin,52 see supplementary table 4 available online only.
Another RCT (Jadad score 5), involving 26 PAH patients (of
whom two had SSc-PAH) indicated that sildenafil (50 mg twice
a day for 4 weeks followed by 50 mg three times a day) was
comparable to, or even better than, bosentan in improving the
6MWT, Borg dyspnoea score and cardiac index.41 The improve￾ment in exercise capacity was maintained to at least 1 year.52
In a subgroup of 84 patients with CTD-PAH (including 38
SSc-PAH patients) sildenafil significantly improved walking
distance (p,0.05 for 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day), functional
class (NNT from 4.0 to 2.9, depending on the sildenafil dose),
mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular
reserve (p,0.05 for 60 mg/day for both) in comparison with
placebo.53
Sildenafil has been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PAH patients in
WHO functional classes II, III and IV.46 The experts indicated
that, compared with bosentan, the amount of data confirming
the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in SSc-PAH was sparse.
Therefore, at present, sildenafil should be considered for the
treatment of SSc-PAH patients in whom bosentan has been
ineffective, or can not be used for safety reasons.
7. One high-quality RCT indicates that continuous intravenous
epoprostenol improves exercise capacity, functional class and
haemodynamic measures in SSc-PAH. Sudden drug withdrawal
may be life threatening.
Intravenous epoprostenol should be considered for the
treatment of patients with severe SSc-PAH.
One RCT (Jadad score 3), involving 111 SSc-PAH patients,
showed that epoprostenol (continuous intravenous infusion,
starting dose 2 ng/kg per minute and increased based on
clinical symptoms and tolerability) in combination with
conventional therapy (diuretics, oral anticoagulants, oxygen
and glycosides), improves exercise capacity, functional status
and haemodynamic measures in SSc-PAH, compared with
conventional therapy.29 The median 6MWT distance
improved by 108 m (95% CI 55 m to 180 m; p,0.001;
epoprostenol vs control group), NYHA functional class
improved in 21 (38%) patients treated with epoprostenol
and none in the control group (NNT 2.7) and the Borg
dyspnoea index and the dyspnoea fatigue score also improved
significantly. The beneficial haemodynamic effects of epo￾prostenol included a statistically significant decrease in
pulmonary vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery
pressure and right atrial pressure, as well as a significant
increase in cardiac index.
Based on the results of RCT and two large long-term
observational studies, which have documented an improvement
in survival of patients with idiopathic PAH treated with
epoprostenol,54 55 intravenous epoprostenol has been approved
by the FDA for the treatment of severe (WHO class III or IV)
PAH.
As a result of a very short half-life, epoprostenol is
administered through a permanent indwelling central venous
catheter, which may favour adverse events: infections, pneu￾mothorax and haemorrhage.29 Sudden disruption/withdrawal of
intravenous eporostenol (due to catheter/vein thrombosis and/
or patient’s decision) may lead to life-threatening PAH rebound.
Epoprostenol is contraindicated in severe left ventricular
dysfunction and if symptoms of pulmonary oedema develop
during epoprostenol dose initiation, which may be associated
with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.56 Based on overall risk￾to-benefit considerations, and in agreement with the current
ACCP guidelines, experts recommend intravenous eporostenol
as the treatment of choice in severe, therapy-resistant SSc￾PAH.46
Although not included in the text of the present recommen￾dations, other prostacyclin analogues are available and approved
for treatment of PAH, see supplementary material available
online only.57–59
III. SSc-related skin involvement
8. Two RCT have shown that methotrexate improves skin score
in early diffuse SSc. Positive effects on other organ manifesta￾tions have not been established.
Methotrexate may be considered for treatment of skin
manifestations of early diffuse SSc.

In one RCT (Jadad score 3), involving 29 SSc patients with
diffuse SSc or limited SSc (mean duration of skin involvement
3.2 years), methotrexate (intramuscularly at a dose of 15 mg/
week for 24 weeks) showed a trend towards improvement of
the total skin score (p = 0.06 vs placebo).60
In the second RCT (Jadad score 5), involving 73 patients with
early diffuse SSc, methotrexate, given orally at a dose of 10 mg
per week for 12 months, decreased the University of California
Los Angeles skin score (ES 0.5, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.0) and the
modified Rodnan skin score (ES 0.5; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.9)
compared with placebo in an intention-to-treat analysis.
Eleven out of 36 patients (31%) in the placebo group and 12
out of 35 patients (34%) in the methotrexate group dropped out
before study completion, mainly due to treatment inefficacy.
There were few premature discontinuations due to adverse
events (number needed to harm 16 and 34.5 in both RCT,
respectively).60 61 There were no significant differences in the
mortality rate (three vs seven; p,0.18), although the trend was
in favour of methotrexate.61 Safety concerns associated with
methotrexate include liver toxicity, pancytopenia, its potential
teratogeneity and, possibly, the induction of lung injury/
interstitial lung disease.60 81
It should be recognised that cyclophosphamide has also been
shown, in RCT, to improve skin changes in SSc patients, and
other agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine or
ciclosporine A are used to treat skin involvement, although their
efficacy has not been studied so extensively,62 see also table 2.
IV. Scleroderma interstitial lung disease
9. In view of the results from two high-quality RCT and despite
its known toxicity, cyclophosphamide should be considered for
the treatment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).
The efficacy and safety of cyclophosphamide in the treatment
of SSc-ILD was evaluated in two high-quality (Jadad score 5)
RCT.62 63 The first trial, involving 158 SSc patients with active
alveolitis, demonstrated that cyclophosphamide given orally at
a dose of 1–2 mg/kg per day improved lung function tests,
dyspnoea score and quality of life over 12 months compared

I SSc-related digital vasculopathy (RP, digital ulcers)
1 A meta-analysis on dihydropiridine-type calcium antagonists and one meta-analysis on prostanoids indicate that nifedipine
and intravenous iloprost reduce the frequency and severity of SSc-RP attacks
A 14 24
Dihydropiridine-type calcium antagonists, usually oral nifedipine, should be considered for first-line therapy for SSc-RP, and
intravenous iloprost, or other available intravenous prostanoids for severe SSc-RP
2 Two RCT indicate that intravenous prostanoids (particularly intravenous iloprost) are efficacious in healing digital ulcers in
patients with SSc. Intravenous prostanoids (in particular iloprost) should be considered in the treatment of active digital
ulcers in patients with SSc
A 21 22
3 Bosentan has no confirmed efficacy in the treatment of active digital ulcers in SSc patients. Bosentan has confirmed
efficacy in two high-quality RCT to prevent digital ulcers in diffuse SSc patients, in particular in those with multiple digital
ulcers
A 30–32
Bosentan should be considered in diffuse SSc with multiple digital ulcers after failure of calcium antagonists and, usually,
prostanoid therapy
II SSc-PAH
4 Two high-quality RCT indicate that bosentan improves exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in PAH. Bosentan should be strongly considered to treat SSc-PAH
A/B 36 37
5 Two high-quality RCT indicate that sitaxentan improves exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in PAH. At present, sitaxentan may also be considered to treat SSc-PAH
A/B 39 47 48
6 One high-quality RCT indicates that sildenafil improves exercise capacity, functional class and some haemodynamic
measures in PAH
A/B 52
Sildenafil may be considered to treat SSc-PAH
7 One high-quality RCT indicates that continuous intravenous epoprostenol improves exercise capacity, functional class and
haemodynamic measures in SSc-PAH. Sudden drug withdrawal may be life threatening
A 29
Intravenous epoprostenol should be considered for the treatment of patients with severe SSc-PAH

with placebo. The placebo-corrected mean (95% CI) improve￾ment in the forced vital capacity and the total lung capacity was
2.5% (0.3% to 4.8%) and 4.1% (0.5% to 7.7%), respectively
(p,0.03 for both measures). Cyclophosphamide did not increase
the lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide.
Cyclophosphamide improved the transitional dyspnoea index
(mean 1.4 (SE 0.2), whereas this index deteriorated in the
placebo group (mean 1.5 (SE 0.4); p,0.001 for between-group
difference). Cyclophosphamide also improved the HAQ dis￾ability index, and the vitality and health-transition domains of
the Short-Form 36 (p,0.05 vs placebo for both measures).62
The second trial evaluated cyclophosphamide (intravenously
at a dose of 600 mg/m2 per month) compared with placebo in 45
SSc patients with SSc-ILD. Active treatment included six
infusions of cyclophosphamide given at 4-week intervals
followed by oral azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg per day) or placebo
for 6 months. Prednisolone (20 mg on alternate days) was co￾administered in the active treatment group. The mean adjusted
between-group difference in forced vital capacity was 4.2% in
favour of cyclophosphamide, which just missed statistical
significance (p = 0.08). The lung diffusing capacity for carbon
monoxide and other outcome measures did not improve.63
There was unanimous consensus about the cyclophosphamide
dose and duration of treatment to be tailored individually
dependent on the clinical condition and response. Potential risks
of bone marrow suppression, teratogeneity, gonadal failure and
haemorrhagic cystitis must be always considered.82
V. Scleroderma renal crisis
10. Despite the lack of RCT, experts believe that angiotensin￾converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used in the
treatment of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC).
RCT evaluating the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in the
treatment of SRC are lacking. Since the first report demonstrat￾ing a beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in two patients with
SRC,64 numerous case reports and uncontrolled studies have
reported on ACE inhibitors in SRC. A prospective analysis of
108 patients with SRC has suggested that patients on ACE
inhibitors (captopril in 47 and enalapril in eight) had a
significantly better survival rate at 1 year (76%) and 5 years
(66%) compared with patients not on ACE inhibitors (15% at
1 year and 10% at 5 years, respectively). Treatment with ACE
inhibitors was significantly associated with better survival in
SRC, after adjustment for age and blood pressure (p,0.001).65
Another prospective uncontrolled study of 145 patients with
SRC treated with ACE inhibitors demonstrated survival rates at
5 and 8 years after the onset of SRC of 90% and 85%,
respectively.66 In addition, treatment with ACE inhibitors
decreased the need for permanent dialysis.65 66 Published
evidence includes mainly captopril and enalapril.
It is highly unlikely that formal RCT will be conducted in this
rare condition with high mortality.
11. Four retrospective studies suggest that steroids are asso￾ciated with a higher risk of SRC. Patients on steroids should be
carefully monitored for blood pressure and renal function.
The impact of steroid use on the development of SRC was
evaluated in four retrospective studies involving 544 SSc
patients, all suggesting an association between steroid treat￾ment and the occurrence of SRC.67–70 A case–control analysis
showed that 36% of patients with SRC had received prednisone
at a dose of 15 mg/day or more or equivalent within 6 months
preceding the onset of SRC, compared with 12% matched
controls (odds ratio 4.4; 95% CI 2.1 to 9.4; p,0.001).68 In
another study, recent exposure to corticosteroids was noted in
61% of SRC patients, and the exposure to corticosteroids during
the previous 3 months was associated with a higher risk of SRC
(relative risk 6.2; 95% CI 2.2 to 17.6).70 An analysis of the main
risk factors for SRC suggested that patients with a high skin
score, joint contractures and prednisone use ((10 mg/day in
nine out of 10 patients) were at higher risk (43% versus 21% of
patient without steroids) of SRC.69
VI. SSc-related gastrointestinal disease
12. Despite the lack of specific RCT, experts believe that proton
pump inhibitors (PPI) should be used for the prevention of SSc￾related gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), oesophageal
ulcers and strictures.
Specific RCT for the efficacy of PPI in patients with SSc are
lacking. The efficacy of PPI in the treatment of GORD in a
general population is well documented in meta-analyses of
RCT.71 72
13. Despite the lack of specific RCT, experts believe that
prokinetic drugs should be used for the management of SSc￾related symptomatic motility disturbances (dysphagia, GORD,
early response in satiety, bloating, pseudo-obstruction, etc).
Small RCT involving SSc or CTD patients indicate that the
short-term usage of cisapride has a beneficial effect on gastric
emptying and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures.73–77
However, in many countries cisapride has either been with￾drawn or has had limited use as a result of reports about long
QT syndrome caused by cisapride, which predisposes to severe
arrhythmias.
Long-term efficacy RCT of other prokinetics in SSc were not
found. Several non-randomised or uncontrolled studies suggest
that prokinetics may improve gastrointestinal signs and
symptoms in SSc patients.78–80
Several prokinetic drugs have shown beneficial effects in RCT
involving patients with other than SSc-related dysmotility
disorders or are under evaluation (for review see Hasler83 and
Karamanolis and Tack84). Whether these drugs would be
effective in the treatment of SSc-related symptomatic motility
disturbances is at present only speculative and needs to be
investigated.
14. Despite the lack of specific RCT, experts believe that, when
malabsorption is caused by bacterial overgrowth, rotating
antibiotics may be useful in SSc.
No RCT regarding the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment
of SSc-related bacterial overgrowth or malabsorption were
found.
In general, current treatment of small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth is based on empirical courses of broad-spectrum
antibiotics such as quinolones or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

The principles of diagnosis and treatment strategies of this
condition have been summarised in a recent excellent review.85
DISCUSSION
The present set of recommendations addresses only a limited
number of the most relevant pharmacological treatments for
SSc. Many were tested in RCT, although some, even in the
absence of RCT, were felt by the expert committee to be
indicated for SSc.
As SSc has a heterogeneous clinical course and is an
uncommon disease, many treatment options have not yet been
able to be appropriately tested. It should be recognised that
‘‘absence of evidence for efficacy’’ does not imply that ‘‘efficacy
is absent’’. Indeed, some treatment options that were not
translated into recommendations because of lack of evidence
were considered important or promising by the expert
committee and were included in the research agenda, see box
1 and table 2.
As a result of the scarcity of high-quality RCT solely
involving SSc patients, several recommendations are based on
evidence extrapolated from other diseases (such as idiopathic
PAH or GORD). These diseases may differ from SSc-related
complications in clinical course and prognosis.
There are also other treatment options for the management
of SSc patients, such as physiotherapy, education, new
experimental therapies, etc, which were beyond the scope of
this project or could not be included because of the lack of
expert consensus.
Medications that are disease modifying for SSc in terms of
mortality are lacking, and the efficacy of the treatments
recommended here is often only modest to moderate.
Nevertheless, given no other options, these less than optimal
treatments are still worthwhile. This set of recommendations
should be helpful to make clinical decisions but should always
be used in the context of the patient, clinical judgement and
with the balance of efficacy and toxicity in mind.
In view of the heterogeneity of SSc, the complexity of the
diagnostic evaluation and the wide array of available treatment
options, experts believe that the referral of patients with SSc to
a specialised centre should be strongly considered.

Table 2 Comments of the expert committee concerning research questions that did not yield a formal
recommendation because of lack of appropriate evidence
Research question Comment from the expert committee
ACE inhibitors and sartans
1 Do angiotensin receptor antagonists (sartans)
have beneficial effects in systemic sclerosis?
One RCT indicates that losartan may reduce the frequency and severity of
RP attacks
Losartan may be recommended for the treatment of RP secondary to SSc
Steroids
1 Are steroids beneficial in SSc? The expert opinion is that a low dose of steroids is commonly used for the
treatment of inflammatory arthritis in patients with SSc but its efficacy is
not substantiated by RCT
HSCT
1 Does HSCT have beneficial effects in SSc? The cumulative phase I–II experience supports the use of HSCT in a
selected poor-prognosis subgroup of SSc. Currently, transplantation
should be performed only in the context of a RCT
Immunosuppressives
1 Is there any evidence of the beneficial effects of
ciclosporine A in SSc?
Two RCT with cyclophosphamide have reported efficacy on skin, quality
of life and function
2 Is there any evidence of the beneficial effects of
mycophenolate mofetil in SSc?
Uncontrolled and retrospectively controlled studies with some
immunosuppressive regimens (such as azathioprine, mycophenolate
mofetil, ciclosporine A) have reported efficacy in selected manifestations
of SSc. Their efficacy has to be evaluated further in RCT (see box 1
Research agenda)
3 Is there any evidence of the beneficial effects of
azathioprine in SSc?
Of note, experts believe that great caution is necessary when using
cyclosporine because it may decrease renal function and induce
hypertension
Other treatments
1 Which drugs are beneficial in subcutaneous
calcinosis in SSc?
Drugs that improve calcinosis are currently lacking
2 Is there any evidence that NSAID are harmful in
SSc?
Experts believe that NSAID are in general not more harmful in SSc than in
the general population, but formal evidence is lacking. NSAID toxicity in
the general population is well recognised
