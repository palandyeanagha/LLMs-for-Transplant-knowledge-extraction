Abstract Case reports
Two patients with moderate renal failure sustained
spontaneous bilateral hip fractures during treatment
with fluoride, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis.
They had been taking sodium fluoride (40-60 mg/day)
for 11 and 21 months, respectively. Histological exami￾nation of a specimen of the bone showed severe fluorosis
in the first case, and quantitative analysis of bone showed
osteomalacia and skeletal fluorosis in the other case.
These abnormalities were considered to be the conse￾quence of excessive retention of fluoride due to renal
insufficiency.
As bilateral femoral neck fractures are very rare these
data suggest a causal link between fractures and fluoride
in patients with renal failure. Thus fluoride should be
given at a lower dosage, if at all, to patients with even
mild renal failure.
Introduction
Fluoride, combined with calcium and vitamin D is effective
in preventing new vertebral crush fractures not only in primary'
but also in corticosteroid induced osteoporosis.2 Fractures of
long bones have been described, however, during fluoride
treatment, and 13 cases of fracture of the femoral neck, none
of them bilateral, have been reported; the cause and effect
relation has not been clearly established.4 6 We report on
two patients with osteoporosis in whom bilateral hip fractures
occurred spontaneously after 11 and 21 months of treatment
with fluoride; the two patients suffered from moderate chronic
renal insufficiency.

CASE 1
The patient, a 69 year old woman, had suffered from seropositive
nodular rheumatoid arthritis since the age of 41; she had been
receiving steroids (prednisone 5 mg daily) since the age of 55. At age
66 chronic pyelonephritis and mild hypertension had been diagnosed.
Spontaneous vertebral crush fractures (L2 and 3) occurred when she
was 68.
At that time the serum concentration of calcium was 2 29 mmol/l
(9 2 mg/100 ml) and of phosphate 1-6 mmol/l (5 0 mg/100 ml), and
alkaline phosphatase activity was 35 IU/I (normal 17-30 IU/l). Serum
creatinine concentration was 230,mol/l (2-6 mg/100 ml) and creatinine
clearance 18 5 ml/min. There was no proteinuria or casts, and urine
cultures were sterile. Urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was 33
jumol/24 h (4 3 mg/24 h) (normal < 420 timol/24 h (< 55 mg/24 h)).
In combination with calcium (1 g daily) and vitamin D, (1000 U
daily) oral sodium fluoride was prescribed (60 mg daily during the
first three months and then 40 mg daily). After 11 months of treatment
she suddenly developed severe pains in both groins. At physical
examination mobility of the hips was appreciably reduced but there
were no signs of a flare up of the arthritis. Pelvic x ray examination
showed bilateral femoral neck fracture; there was also bilateral acetabu￾lar protrusion. At this time serum calcium concentration was 2-03
mmol/l (8 1 mg/100 ml), serum phosphate concentration 1-2 mmol/l
(3 7 mg/100 ml), creatinine concentration 250 yimol/l (2 8 mg/100 ml),
and alkaline phosphatase activity 73 IU/1. Plasma parathyroid hor￾mone concentration was 0 22 ng/ml (normal <0 15 ng/ml, carbo￾xyterminal assay) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration 57 nmol/l
(22 8 ng/ml) (normal 23-85 nmol/l (9-2-34-0 ng/ml)). Total hip
replacement with a Charnley prosthesis was performed on both sides.
Histological examination of the femoral head showed no gross
excess of unmineralised osteoid; there were signs -of osteoarthritis
with erosion of cartilage, but no inflammatory signs were detectable
in the synovial membrane, although fibrous changes had occurred.
Microradiographs of sections of bone tissue performed according
to the method of Baud et all showed mottled bone with mottled
lacunas and hypervascularity in the compact as well as in the cancellous
bone; hypomineralised linear formation defects were also present.
These findings strongly suggested severe fluorosis (fig 1).
The bone fluoride content of the surgical specimen was measured
on calcinated compact bone with a specific electrode according to
the method of McCann.8 A value of 0 506°, was found which appears
to be high compared with the normal value (0.10 (SE 0.06%))7 and
values reported in patients with osteoporosis treated with fluoride
(0 21 to 0 400,o/).9
CASE 2
A 78 year old woman suffered from recent lumbar pain for three
weeks before admission. She had a history of hypertension, angina
pectoris, and bilateral thrombosis of the popliteal artery. X ray
examination of the pelvis showed arterial calcification and signs
of bilateral osteoarthrosis of the hips. X ray examination of
the spine showed a crush fracture of LI. Serum calcium concentration
was 2 12 mmol/l (8-5 mg/100 ml), serum phosphate concentration
0 87 mrnmol/l (2-7 mg/100 ml), serum alkaline phosphatase activity
20 IU/1, serum creatinine concentration 133 iymol/l (1 5 mg/100 ml),
and urinary hydroxyproline excretion 435 ymol/24 h (57 mg/24 h).
There was no proteinuria.
A transiliac bone biopsy was performed after double labelling with
tetracycline, and undecalcified sections were quantitativelyanalysed
according to previously reported methods.'0 The trabecular bone
volume was 12-2o (normal 14 8 (SE 3 3)), the thickness index of

osteoid seams was low at 11-4 (normal 17-7 (4 0)), and the rate of
mineralisation was normal at 0-79 ,um/day (normal 0-72 (0-12) ,um/
day). Primary osteoporosis was diagnosed.
In combination with calcium (1 g daily) and vitamin D2 (8000 U
daily) oral sodium fluoride was prescribed at a dose of 50 mg/day.
After nine months of treatment another vertebral collapse (TlO) was
noted. After 15 months of treatment calcium and vitamin D supple￾mentation was withdrawn because of the calcified arteries. After 20
months of treatment she complained of pain in the right hip. X ray
examination showed an incomplete fracture of the right femoral neck.

1 09 mmol/I (3-4 mg/100 ml), serum alkaline phosphatase activity 40
IU/I, and parathyroid hormone concentration (carboxyterminal assay)
4 2 mU/ml (normal 4-0 (0-8) mU/ml). Urinary hydroxyproline excre￾tion was 235 tmol/24 h (30-8 mg/24 h). Serum fluoride concentration
was very high (22 ,4mol/l (4-8 ,ug/100 ml)) on two occasions, and mean
urinary fluoride excretion measured on three consecutive days was
low (89-5 ttmol/24 h) (1-7 mg/24 h)) compared with values obtained in
38 patients with osteoporosis treated with fluoride (serum fluoride
concentration 10 (5-3) ,umol/l (19-0 (10 1) tog/100 ml) and urinary
fluoride excretion 400 (270) tomol/24 h (7-6 (5- 1) mg/24 h)).
An iliac bone biopsy specimen obtained after double labelling with
tetracycline showed osteomalacia with an increased thickness of osteoid
seams (37-0) and a decreased rate of calcification (less than 0-20
/im/day) (fig 2). Bone fluoride content measured on compact bone
of the inner cortex was found to be very high at 0 73",. Microradio￾graphs of bone sections showed signs of severe histological bone
fluorosis (mottled bone, hypervascularity, and hypomineralised linear
formation defects) comparable with those observed in case 1. Sodium
fluoride was thus stopped and replaced with calcium 1 g daily and
vitamin D, 8000 U daily. One month later the patient was readmitted
with a complete intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur, for which
a metallic implant was inserted.
Discussion
Spontaneous fracture of the femoral neck is a rare finding in
primary" as well as in steroid induced osteoporosis.') Fractures
of the femoral neck have already been described in patients
with osteoporosis receiving fluoride treatment, and have generally
been considered to be secondary to fluoride induced osteo￾malacia.4 Concurrent administration of calcium and vitamin
D, however, prevents or at least minimises defective minerali￾sation of bone.'3
In the two cases reported here there was severe skeletal
fluorosis as shown by a high bone fluoride content and pro￾nounced histological abnormalities (mottled bone, hypervascu￾larity) on the microradiographs of bone sections. I Further￾more, in case 2 histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac
bone biopsy specimen indicated an accumulation of osteoid
tissue due to impairment of mineralisation. In this case the
serum fluoride concentration was high and urinary fluoride
excretion was considerably reduced compared with values
obtained in patients with osteoporosis treated with fluoride.2
In both these cases the accumulation of sodium fluoride in
bone was probably due to reduced renal function. Urinary
excretion of fluoride is reduced when creatinine clearance
reaches values of about 25 ml/min.'4 Cases of skeletal fluorosis
have been reported in patients with severe renal failure" 16
even with a daily fluoride intake as low as 4 mg."' In patients
without renal failure bone fluorosis may occur when the daily
dose of ingested sodium fluoride is higher than 60 mg,3 13 18
and fractures of bones have been described in patients without
renal failure but with severe fluorosis induced by treatment with
niflumic acid.6 "9 An increased risk of fractures might be due
to changes in the mechanical properties of the bone induced
by an accumulation of fluoride in the bone tissue, whether or
not osteomalacia is present.
The tensile strength of bone in patients with severe fluorosis
is decreased,20 21 and there is an enlargement of periosteocytic
lacunar surfaces and excess cortical porosity.7 In contrast, bone
strength is increased in patients with moderate fluorosis21-
that is, in those with a sodium fluoride intake of less than
60 mg a day' and normal renal function.
These data show that treatment with fluoride at the generally
prescribed dose may induce severe skeletal fluorosis in patients
with impaired renal function. Thus before treatment is started
renal function should be carefully assessed; the drug should
either not be given at all or should be given at a lower dosage
to patients with renal failure.
We are grateful to Professor R Lagier who performed the histo￾logical examination in case 1, and to Professor P Burckhardt for his
critical review of the manuscript.

SHORT REPORTS
Sickle cell anaemia, oxygen
treatment, and anaemic crisis
Vaso-occlusion by sickled erythrocytes is believed to underlie the
major clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. Since sickling is
promoted by deoxygenation in vitro it seems logical and, indeed, it
is common practice to administer oxygen to patients with sickle cell
disease experiencing acute vaso-occlusive crises. While the danger of
even moderate hypoxia and the need for maintaining adequate
oxygenation are obvious in these patients the untoward effects of
hyperoxygenation are less well appreciated. This report illustrates
the danger of overzealous administration of oxygen.
Case report
A 24 year old black man with sickle cell anaemia was admitted to hospital
with an "acute chest syndrome." Sputum and blood samples were obtained
for cultures and he was given empirical treatment with penicillin. Later a
mycoplasma infection was suspected and erythromycin was added to the
treatment. His arterial oxygen pressure (Po2) was 9-7 kPa (73 mm Hg) so
oxygen was given by a nasal cannula at 8 1/min which raised his Po2 to
15-2 kPa (114 mm Hg). His initial packed cell volume was 0-265 (26.5%),
reticulocyte count 10-6%, lactate dehydrogenase activity 505 IU/ml and
total bilirubin concentration 66-7 umol/l (3.9 mg/100 ml). On the fourth
day, as his chest syndrome was rapidly improving, the reticulocyte count
acutely decreased to 1-4% and remained at that figure for the next three
days. There was an associated rapid decrease in his packed cell volume to
0-175 (17 5%0), the lactate dehydrogenase activity fell to 298 IU/ml, and the
total bilirubin concentration to 24-0 Hmol/l (1-4 mg/100 ml) (figure). Red
cell transfusions were considered but not carried out, and a bone marrow
aspiration was contemplated; but during the investigation into the cause
of the anaemic crisis we discovered that the patient had been maintained at
an arterial Po2 of > 13-3 kPa (>100 mm Hg) immediately before and
throughout the period of reticulocytopenia. Discontinuation of oxygen
administration resulted in a prompt rebound reticulocytosis and a rapid
return of the packed cell volume to a steady state. Bacteriological studies
and serological test for mycoplasma infection were negative.
Comment
The temporal relation of the haematological events and the ad￾ministration of oxygen combined with a lack of evidence for a bacterial
or mycoplasmal infection and the rarity of parvovirus infection in this
age group' leave an excessive partial pressure of oxygen as the most
likely cause of the acute suppression of erythropoiesis. Hypoxia is a
strong erythropoietic stimulus-but the erythrosuppressive effect of
hyperoxia, though well established, is not widely known. Many years
