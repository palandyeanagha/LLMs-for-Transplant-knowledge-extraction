asparaginase (5,000 U/m²/day for day 12, 15, 18, 21,
24, 27, 30 and 33), vincristine (1,5 mg/m²/day for day
8, 15, 22 and 29) and intratechal methotrexate (at age￾adjusted dose for day 1, 12 and 33).6 On day 15, bone
marrow aspiration revealed <5% blast, slightly
decreased cellularity with lymphocyte predominance.
On the 17th day of therapy, he developed febrile
neutropenia and imipenem/cilastatin (60 mg/kg/day)
and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was commenced. On
day 20, fluconazole (loading dose 12 mg/kg/day iv,
followed by 6 mg/kg/day q 24 hr iv) was added to
therapy because of persistent fever and mild oral
moniliasis. On day 22, he developed tachypnea; at
physical examination rales were present. Despite a
presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia, computed
tomography (CT) of thorax and abdominal
ultrasonography were unremarkable. Blood and urine
cultures and galactomannan antigen were all negative.
Although oral moniliasis resolved, fever and rales
persisted and repeated thorax CT demonstrated several
ground grass areas and a 5mm nodular lesion
surrounded by ground-glass opacity. For a possible
Aspergillus infection, fluconazole therapy was shifted
to voriconazole (loading dose 6 mg/kg/dose 2 doses,
maintenance dose 4 mg/kg/dose iv 2 doses) on day 25.
His condition improved shortly thereafter. Induction
chemotherapy was completed along with antibiotic and
antifungal treatment despite persistence of fever. In the
interim, his leukocyte count, serum alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), serum γ-glutamyl transferase
(GGT) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels
began to rise, and reached their top values including
leukocyte count of 36.1x109
/L, ALP of 1096 U/L
(normal range, 145-420 U/L), GGT of 674 U/L
(normal range, 5-32 U/L) and CRP of 23 mg/dl
(normal range, 0.08-1.12 mg/dl). Peripheral blood
smear revealed neutrophilia without any blast. At
abdominal ultrasonography multiple hypoechoic
millimetric hepatic nodules were noted (Figure 1).
Despite his good clinical condition, persistence of
fever, elevated ALP and CRP levels and hypoechoic
ultrasonographic images in the liver, led us to the
diagnosis of possible HSC.7 Although the use of
antibacterial, antifungal drugs and chemotherapeutics
in our patient might have caused hepatotoxicity and
therefore mimic laboratory findings of HSC,
combination of clinical, laboratory and radiological
findings following neutrophil recovery led us to the
diagnosis of HSC. Dexamethasone (0,5 mg/kg) was
added to voriconazole therapy. Fever disappeared in
three days period and leukocyte count, serum ALP,
GGT and CRP levels were normalized within 7 days.
Corticosteroid therapy was, thereafter, tapered in a 7
days period and stopped. Hypoechoic ultrasound
images in the liver disappeared 30 days after initiation

of corticosteroid therapy (Figure 2). Antifungal
therapy in combination with chemotherapy was
continued for three months. He is currently in
remission and receiving maintenance therapy of BFM.
Discussion: Hepatosplenic candidiasis has been
reported in cancer patients particularly with acute
leukemia during neutropenia.8-10 It is often clinically
apparent during neutrophil recovery.9 The frequency of
HSC has been reported between 3-29% depending on
the diagnostic criteria.10 Although not specific for
HSC, young age, neutropenia (absolute neutrophil
count <500 µL) lasting more than 15 days, and the use
of prophylactic quinolones have been reported to be
independent risk factors for both acute and chronic
invasive candidiasis.10 It has been hypothesized that
HSC develops as a result of prolonged neutropenia and
gastrointestinal mucosal damage in the context of
immune dysregulation due to defective coordination of
Th1/Th2 response in conjunction with other immune

imbalance.3,10 Recently Th1/Th17 pathway has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of fungal infection
related IRIS.11 There has been increased recognition of
the role of endogenous levels of certain cytokines such
as IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and some immunomodulators as
likely contributing factors in the pathogenesis of
systemic candidal infection.6,10,11
A diagnosis of HSC should be suspected with fever
unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics during
neutropenic stage and following its recovery, and the
presence of symptoms and physical findings including
upper abdominal pain, tenderness, jaundice, and
hepatosplenomegaly. Increased serum liver function
tests, abnormal hepato-splenic imaging at CT or
ultrasonography and histopathologic evidence of
Candida spp. in the biopsy specimens make the
diagnosis of HSC.10 Furthermore, clinical/laboratory
evidence of other infections and/or clinical conditions
such as progressive infection, drug toxicity or
breakthrough infections should be excluded.
Amphotericine B is accepted as the initial agent of
choice for HSC. Alternative options include the use of
azoles particularly fluconazole, voriconazole and
echinocandins.12,13 Therapy should be continued until
calcification or resolution of lesions, particularly in
patients receiving continued chemotherapy or
immunosuppression.12 Hepatosplenic candidiasis
requires several months of antifungal therapy, thus
interrupt the treatment of underlying leukemia. Delay
in the treatment of leukemia may affect the course and
survival of these patients. As recently reported,
addition of corticosteroid therapy to antifungal therapy
in patients with HSC related IRIS has found to be
associated with disappearance of clinical symptoms,
radiologic abnormalities and inflammatory markers.6,14
It was supposed that corticosteroids might adjust the
paradoxical immune response by modulating both
mononuclear phagocyte function and T-cell activation.6
In our case, we observed that adjuvant corticosteroid
therapy, in addition to antifungal treatment, provided a
rapid and complete resolution of clinical and laboratory
and subsequently radiological findings.
In conclusion, HSC-related IRIS should be
suspected in febrile immune compromised patients
especially during neutrophil recovery with exaggerated
inflammatory response and persistent symptoms
despite receiving antifungal therapy. It should be kept
in mind that, addition corticosteroid therapy to
appropriate antifungal treatment may result in prompt
resolution of clinical and laboratory findings.
