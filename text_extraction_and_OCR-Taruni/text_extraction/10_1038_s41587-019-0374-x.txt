Standard preservation of donor livers is performed by flushing 
the organ with a cold solution at the time of procurement, which 
is followed by static storage on ice. This approach reduces liver 
metabolic activity, allowing safe storage for up to 12–18h (refs. 1,2
). 
Recently, the combination of supercooling with subzero storage 
(−4 °C) and hypothermic, as well as subnormothermic, machine 
perfusion achieved an extension of the preservation time of human 
livers up to 27h (ref. 2
). By contrast, human livers can also be kept 
metabolically fully active for up to 24h by supplying normothermic 
blood or oxygenated fluids in a controlled environment by machine 
perfusion1,3–5
. The possibility of repairing poor-quality livers suffi￾ciently to enable transplantation requires preserving metabolically 
active livers1,3
 for several days. Accordingly, the need for long-term 
organ preservation technology has been endorsed by multiple pri￾vate and governmental initiatives1
. However, currently used normo￾thermic machine perfusion technologies have been used only for a 
relatively short time period (for example, a median perfusion time 
of 9h (ref. 5
)), to successfully maintain hemodynamics, perfusate 
oxygenation and temperature.
We sought to extend perfusion time beyond 24h by engineer￾ing a perfusion machine that recapitulates additional core body 
functions that are critical to liver health. We chose 7-d as a target 
because this time period has been shown to offer a credible time 
frame for inducing clinically relevant liver regeneration in patients 
undergoing complex liver resection6–8
. Under physiologic condi￾tions, the liver, which constitutes 2.5% of body weight, receives 
25% of the blood output of the heart and performs >5,000 func￾tions9
. It has a unique dual vascular supply with high-pressure, 
oxygen-rich arterial blood entering through the hepatic artery and 
low-pressure, oxygen-reduced portal vein blood draining the 
abdominal viscera. Its high metabolic activity produces waste 
products that are excreted in the bile or removed by hepatic mac￾rophages or the kidneys. The metabolic profile is largely controlled 
by pancreatic hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Our per￾fusion technology, developed in the “Liver4Life project”, includes 
automated control of glucose levels by injection of insulin and glu￾cagon, a dialysis membrane for waste-product removal, regulation 
of oxygenation and liver movement to prevent pressure necrosis.
Results
Liver perfusion machine. Our perfusion machine (Fig. 1a,b) reca￾pitulates blood supply through the two vascular entries of the liver, 
the hepatic artery and portal vein. The hepatic artery is supplied 
with oxygen-rich blood at elevated pressure (mean arterial pressure 
(MAP)≥65mmHg) in a pulsatile manner (Fig. 1c), whereas the por￾tal vein receives blood at low pressure (around 5–10mmHg) with a 
reduced oxygen content (venous blood, non-pulsatile). The system 
maintains oxygen saturation of 65% in the vena cava by continu￾ously adjusting oxygen content in the portal vein (Fig. 1d). In vivo, 
nutrients and bile salts are transported from the intestine to the liver 
via the portal vein. To recapitulate this, we inject parenteral nutri￾tion and ursodeoxycholic acid into the portal vein line of our perfu￾sion machine. Hepatic artery hemodynamics are tightly controlled 
by automated infusion of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (Fig. 1e) 
into the hepatic artery line. The pressure in the vena cava is con￾tinuously kept at physiological levels close to 0mmHg (0–2mmHg) 
to prevent liver congestion. An oxygenator provides oxygen to the 
hepatic artery and to the portal vein while removing CO2 from

The ability to preserve metabolically active livers ex vivo for 1 week or more could allow repair of poor-quality livers that would 
otherwise be declined for transplantation. Current approaches for normothermic perfusion can preserve human livers for only 
24 h. Here we report a liver perfusion machine that integrates multiple core physiological functions, including automated man￾agement of glucose levels and oxygenation, waste-product removal and hematocrit control. We developed the machine in a 
stepwise fashion using pig livers. Study of multiple ex vivo parameters and early phase reperfusion in vivo demonstrated the 
viability of pig livers perfused for 1 week without the need for additional blood products or perfusate exchange. We tested the 
approach on ten injured human livers that had been declined for transplantation by all European centers. After a 7-d perfusion, 
six of the human livers showed preserved function as indicated by bile production, synthesis of coagulation factors, maintained 
cellular energy (ATP) and intact liver structure.

the perfusate. The oxygen tension in the hepatic artery is continu￾ously monitored and controlled to remain in predefined bounds, 
that is, 10–12 kPa. The CO2 tension is adapted via the oxygenator to 
maintain blood pH between 7.25 and 7.45 (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). We incorporated an integrated dialysis unit for physiologic 
electrolyte balance and removal of metabolic waste products from 
the blood.
We used an algorithm to automatically adjust the dialysate flow, 
controlling the concentration of red blood cells (hematocrit) on 
the basis of continuous measurements (Fig. 1f). Automated insulin 
(Fig. 1g) and glucagon administration was used to maintain physi￾ological blood glucose levels (targeted range of 3.5–6.5mmoll
−1
) in 
response to continuous glucose measurements. Continuous move￾ment of the liver, in an effort to mimic diaphragm oscillations, is 
also integrated into the system (Supplementary Fig. 1). The perfu￾sion machine is fully automated obviating the need for constant 
presence of personnel. Features of the described long-term perfu￾sion technology as compared to the commercially available perfu￾sion machines are summarized in Fig. 1h.
Through early experiments using pig livers we identified five 
major hurdles, each limiting successful long-term liver preservation 
with blood-based perfusate, namely, control of glucose metabolism, 
prevention of hemolysis, removal of waste products, control of per￾fusate oxygenation and simulation of diaphragm movement (Fig. 2). 
These obstacles were studied and overcome through incremental 
steps using 70 healthy pig livers, before initiating the human study.
Glucose metabolism. We first perfused pig livers with a hyper￾glycemic perfusate (perfusate glucose >10mmoll
−1
) at fixed 
insulin injection rates (0.9Uh−1
). Although glucose is not the pri￾mary energy source for hepatocytes10, perfusion protocols avail￾able in the literature4,5,11,12 have used this approach. For example, 
the pioneering randomized controlled trial of normothermic liver 
perfusion in humans also reported high glucose levels in the per￾fusate (>10mmoll
−1
) at a constant insulin injection rate (7Uh−1
)5
. 
However, using this approach, we observed high insulin concentra￾tions in the perfusate (229±72pmoll
−1
), which led to activation of 
glycogen synthase and excessive glycogen deposition in liver tissue, 
similar to what is seen in glycogen-storage diseases (Fig. 2a,c and 
Supplementary Fig. 2).
In the next series of experiments, we reduced glucose levels in 
the perfusate to 4mmoll
−1
 by manually adjusting the glucose infu￾sion rate resulting in considerable reduction of glycogen deposition 
(Fig. 2a). The persistence of high levels of insulin (0.9Uh−1
), how￾ever, resulted in activation of glucose uptake by hepatocytes and 
deprivation of glucose for erythrocytes in the perfusate (erythro￾cytes rely only on glucose as an energy source owing to their lack 
of mitochondria), implying failure of manual control (Fig. 2b and 
Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we included a device with auto￾mated monitoring of glucose levels in the perfusate using a continu￾ous online sensor (Figs. 1g and 2a,c, and Supplementary Fig. 2). We 
implemented closed-loop control of glucose levels by automatically 
injecting insulin and glucagon (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Minimizing hemolysis. Hemolysis is a common shortcoming in 
liver perfusion systems using blood-based perfusates owing to expo￾sure to foreign surfaces and non-pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic 
artery. Elevated hemolysis with a non-pulsatile pump is potentially 
explained by sludge and erythrocyte stasis, which is prevented with 
pulsatile perfusion13–16.
To decrease hemolysis in our system, we opted for a perfusion 
loop design with only one pump head and one oxygenator despite 
having a dual perfusion route. Pulsatile flow in the hepatic artery 
was generated by varying the rotational speed of the centrifugal 
pump head with a targeted MAP of 65mmHg and 60 beats per 
minute creating a pulse waveform that mimicked the in vivo set￾ting (Fig. 1c). Pulsatile flow caused a significantly lower degree of 
hemolysis (0.2±0.1 g l
−1
 versus 0.7±0.2 g l
−1
; P<0.001) after 24h of 
perfusion (Fig. 2d) as compared to non-pulsatile flow.
Electrolyte control. We observed elevated sodium levels (hyperna￾tremia) during liver perfusion, reaching levels of up to 200mmoll
−1
, 
which has detrimental effects on organ viability. Serum sodium 
concentrations of >165mmoll
−1
 in liver donors is considered an 
extended criterion, which was observed in a human liver perfu￾sion without an integrated dialysis system5,17. To prevent hyperna￾tremia, we integrated a dialysis membrane in the perfusion loop, 
performing critical excretory kidney functions (Figs. 1f and 2e). 
An additional effect of dialysis was the automated modulation of 
a transmembrane flow (TMF) of dialysate across the dialysis fil￾ter membrane, which allows the control of the hematocrit level 
(Fig. 2f). These refinements enabled us to run perfusion for 7-d 
without the need for exchanging the perfusate or using any addi￾tional blood products. In addition, dialysis also removed metabolic 
waste products, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN; Fig. 2g).
Physiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal vein. Despite 
the uniform delivery of highly oxygenized blood through the 
hepatic artery, most reported liver perfusion systems provide 
non-physiologic arterial blood also through the portal vein4,5,11,12. 
However, in our preliminary experiments we found that hyperoxy￾genation in the portal vein was associated with the need for high 
amounts of vasodilators (285±162milliliter per week) to maintain 
a physiologic flow in the hepatic artery (Fig. 2h,i); a finding consis￾tent with other reports indicating enhanced arterial vasoconstric￾tion owing to hyperoxygenation18,19. To avoid over oxygenation in 
the portal vein, we mixed the deoxygenated venous blood from the 
blood reservoir with the freshly oxygenated blood from the oxygen￾ator. An algorithm enabled automatic adjustment of oxygen satura￾tion in the portal vein to maintain a target saturation of 65% in the 
vena cava (Fig. 1d). With this approach, the need for vasodilators 
decreased from 285±162milliliters per week to 41±34milliliters 
per week (P=0.011), despite maintaining physiologic flow in the 
hepatic artery (Fig. 2i).
Liver movement. In the human body, the liver and other organs move 
rhythmically owing to attachment to the diaphragm. A consistent

observation of ex vivo livers perfused on static systems support is 
heterogeneous perfusion of the hepatic parenchyma and consecu￾tive local pressure necrosis11,20,21 (Fig. 2j). In pilot studies, keep￾ing the liver in situ in cadaveric pigs, we tested the importance of 
diaphragm movement by artificially maintaining lung ventilation. 
We found that ventilation-associated diaphragm movement pre￾vented pressure necrosis (Fig. 2j). To simulate this movement in the 
ex vivo system, we placed the liver on a silicone mat, which was

fixed on the edges inside the organ chamber. An inflatable balloon 
was positioned beneath the mat and connected to an air oscillator to 
induce oscillating movement (automated lifting and lowering) of the 
liver 15 times per minute (Supplementary Fig. 1). To test adequate 
perfusion after 7d of ex vivo perfusion, we evaluated the distribu￾tion of the radioactive tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as an 
indicator of preserved metabolism and viability inside the liver with 
positron emission tomography combined with computed tomogra￾phy (PET-CT). This approach demonstrated homogeneous metab￾olism and iodinated contrast medium distribution with absence of 
non-perfused areas in contact places to the silicon mat (Fig. 2k).
Early phase of reperfusion of pig livers after 7-d perfusion. We 
tested the viability of eight pig livers perfused with autologous 
blood after 1 week of perfusion without exchanging the perfusate 
or adding any blood products. All livers showed preserved liver 
functions with production of bile flow over the entire perfusion 
period (Supplementary Fig. 3). While we observed an initial tem￾porary increase of injury markers such as aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST) and 8-hydroxydesoxyguanosin (8-OHdG) within the 
first 12h of perfusion, these values declined in the following days 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Cytochrome C, an established marker for 
mitochondrial membrane injury, did not increase over the 7-d 
period and histology after 7-d of perfusion revealed no relevant 
necrosis or features of endothelial activation (Supplementary 
Figs. 3 and 4).
To test in vivo reperfusion injury and viability after a 7-d perfu￾sion, we transplanted three livers in recipient pigs of similar size. As 
controls, we also transplanted five livers that had been kept only for 
2–3h with static cold storage before transplantation22. The aim of 
these experiments was to confirm feasibility of vascular anastomo￾ses and to investigate the early phase of reperfusion after long-term 
perfusion. All transplant experiments were terminated 3h after 
transplantation under general anesthesia because survival experi￾ments with cessation of general anesthesia were prohibited by our 
local animal protection authorities. Therefore, the main endpoints 
of these transplantation experiments remained early markers of 
reperfusion injury, including release of transaminases and histol￾ogy. These results indicated no difference between release of liver 
enzymes and histology as compared to controls livers that had been 
transplanted after standard cold storage without long-term preser￾vation in the machine perfusion system22 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Seven-day perfusion and assessment of human livers. Next we 
applied the technology to human livers. Although pig and human 
livers have similar size and architecture, several substantial adjust￾ments were necessary to successfully perfuse human livers. First, 
in contrast to pig liver perfusion with autologous fresh donor pig 
blood, the perfusate used for human livers consisted of preserved 
packed human blood products with altered electrolyte levels (for 
example, high potassium (>10mmol) and low pH (<7.0)). Thus, 
electrolyte levels and pH were corrected through an integrated 
dialysis before starting perfusion. Second, pig and human livers dis￾closed differences in the sensitivity toward glucagon, with the need 
to adjust glucagon levels (0.11Uml−1
 in human versus 0.01Uml−1
in pigs). Third, the vasodilator nitroprussiat used in pigs is not 
approved for human use in Switzerland and was therefore replaced 
by epoprostinolium (Flolan, GlaxoSmithKline)11. Fourth, the final 
human protocol includes ursodeoxycholic acid, which is commonly 
used in the clinic, in place of taurocholic acid derivatives for bile 
flow stimulation.
We perfused ten human livers that had been declined for trans￾plantation by all hospitals in Switzerland, then in all Europe owing 
to poor quality, and as such were to be discarded (Supplementary 
Table 1). We connected the human livers to the ex vivo perfusion 
machine through the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile 
duct. The perfusion was conducted using a blood-based perfusate, 
reconstituted from packed erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma, albu￾min and platelets (Supplementary Table 2) at 34 °C owing to protec￾tive effects at this temperature23.
In standard clinical transplantation, organs are preserved at about 
4 °C under anaerobic conditions for up to 12–18h before implanta￾tion. Many of these livers suffer additionally from prepreservation 
injury (that is, injury occurring before recovery of the organ owing 
to, for example, instability of the donor before death or medical 
treatment in intensive care units) and ischemia–reperfusion injury 
at the time of preservation and transplantation24. Consequently, cell 
death (~15%) is observed in most post-transplant biopsy speci￾mens, even under optimal clinical conditions25,26. Similar to clini￾cal transplantation, ischemia–reperfusion injury is unavoidable in 
machine-perfused livers when connecting the liver to the machine 
after cold storage and subsequently perfusing with oxygenated per￾fusates. To assess the livers during machine perfusion, we measured 
a number of parameters. In the perfusate, we monitored hepatocel￾lular enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST), signaling

proteins (damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)), uric 
acid, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), the anti￾inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and clearance of 
ammonia and lactate. We also measured liver tissue energy sources, 
such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycogen in tissue 
(measurement details are provided in the Methods). We also 
obtained daily liver tissue samples for histology. The liver sections 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff 
(PAS) stain, and with antibodies against von Willebrand factor, 
phosphohistone 3 (pH3), CD68, cleaved caspase 3, Ki-67 and cyto￾keratin 7 (Methods).
Injury markers and DAMPs. We found that six of the livers, which 
we numbered 1 to 6, demonstrated a decrease in injury and inflam￾mation markers and DAMPS (ALT, AST, IL-6, IL-10 and uric acid) 
usually occurring after day 1 or 2 after perfusion, whereas the other 
four livers (numbered 7 to 10) failed to show any improvement 
in terms of injury and inflammation markers, as well as DAMPS 
(Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 6). Livers 1 to 6 were maintained 
viable for the targeted time period of 1 week, while livers 7 to 10 
failed to reach this objective, showing ongoing cell death and signs 
of liver failure. This required a premature termination of the experi￾ment with a lack of data for perfusion days 5 to 7.

Tissue injury assessed by histological analysis. The histological 
analysis of the livers before insertion into the perfusion machine 
revealed cirrhosis (n=1), fibrosis grade 2–3 (n=3), macrosteato￾sis (>25%, n=1; >50%, n=1), inflammatory infiltrates (n=4) 
and necrosis (n=1) (Supplementary Table 1). In livers 1 to 6, we 
observed injury until the second perfusion day, as assessed by 
hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 3e–g). However, the number 
of non-viable cells declined continuously to reach the lowest level

of 0.95±1.1 per high-power field (HPF; ×40 magnification) on day 
seven. In steatotic livers we observed clearance of fat, pointing to 
lipopeliosis as a sign for viable and functionally active macrophages 
(Fig. 3h). During perfusion, mitotic cells were also documented as 
a measure of preserved cell proliferation capacity ex vivo (Fig. 3i,j). 
After 1 week of perfusion, liver biopsies in livers 1 to 6 did not show 
evidence of substantial cell death (Supplementary Fig. 6). A PET-CT 
demonstrated preserved metabolism with absence of relevant non￾perfused areas in places of contact with the silicon mat after 1 week 
of perfusion (Fig. 3k). With respect to total glycogen content of 
tissue we did not see a statistical difference between livers 1 to 6 
and 7 to 10. However, PAS staining detected an unequivocal gly￾cogen loss in non-viable areas in livers 7 to 10 as compared to 
homogenous staining in livers 1 to 6. These findings suggest an 
unequal qualitative glycogen distribution in livers 7 to 10 without 
a change in total glycogen amount as compared to livers 1 to 6 
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
By contrast, hematoxylin and eosin staining of livers 7 to 10 
showed higher injury, accompanied by low glucose levels in the per￾fusate at perfusion termination (Fig. 3e). Continuous substitution of 
glucose was necessary in these livers to maintain physiological per￾fusate glucose levels, similar to severe liver failure in clinical cases.
Livers 1 to 6 generally had endothelial cells with intact struc￾ture as assessed by immunohistochemistry of von Willebrand fac￾tor and mRNA level detection of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 
(ICAM1) (Supplementary Fig. 6). By contrast, livers 7 to 10 gener￾ally showed activation of von Willebrand factor in areas of necrosis 
and elevated ICAM1 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 6).

All livers lost weight during ex vivo perfusion (27.7±7.7%; 
Supplementary Table 1).
Liver function. All perfused livers demonstrated considerable 
biological functions during ex vivo perfusion (Fig. 4). They con￾tinuously consumed oxygen (Fig. 4a), with increasing cellular 
ATP synthesis as compared to baseline values (Fig. 4b). Also, BUN 
production (Supplementary Fig. 6), lactate clearance (Fig. 4c) and 
maintenance of albumin level were present in all livers (Fig. 4d). 
Nine livers showed ammonia clearance and synthesis of 
coagulation factor V (Fig. 4e,f), and seven of ten livers produced 
bile continuously (Fig. 4g), with effective bilirubin clearance 
(Fig. 4h). The mean blood pH was maintained between 7.2 and 
7.5 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The perfusate was never exchanged 
during the entire course of perfusion in all cases (Fig. 4i–k). 
Additional blood products were not added except for liver 5, 
where there was substantial loss of the perfusate owing to a leak in 
the oxygenator.

Additionally, it should be noted that the kinetics of cytokine and injury marker release are more decisive than peak values, as absolute levels are dependent 
on liver mass and perfusate volume.

Hemodynamic response to vasoactive substances. Under physi￾ologic conditions, hepatic artery flow is tightly controlled by the 
autonomic nervous system and vasoactive substances, which are 
dependent on liver signals, whereas portal vein flow acts indepen￾dently9
. The hepatic artery response to vasoactive substances is 
therefore a valuable sign of organ viability9
. With a flow of 1 lmin−1
, 
the portal pressure could be maintained in physiological range 
(<10mmHg) in each liver except in two livers (livers 1 and 3) 
that had pre-existing fibrosis and cirrhosis (portal vein pressure 
12–15mmHg), a typical feature observed in the clinic with patients 
suffering from injured parenchyma. For livers 1 to 6, flow rates in 
the hepatic artery remained constant with infusion of vasoactive 
substances (Figs. 1e and 5a). By contrast, livers 7 to 10 became 
unresponsive to even high amounts of vasoconstrictors (vasoplegia) 
shortly after initiating perfusion (n=1) or on day 4 (n=2). This 
vasoplegia translated into a pressure of less than 45mmHg in the 
hepatic artery despite high vasoconstrictor infusion at a hepatic 
artery flow of 0.6 lmin−1
 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7).
Discussion
In this study, we developed a perfusion machine preserving pig and 
human livers for 1 week with consistently good outcomes as assessed 
by intact liver structure on histology and preserved function as indi￾cated by bile production, synthesis of blood proteins, maintenance 
of cellular energy (ATP), as well as an appropriate response to pan￾creatic hormones or vasoactive drugs. Because of restrictions by our 
local animal protection authorities, we were not able to assess trans￾plantation efficacy beyond the time of extubation, but observation 
for a few hours after reperfusion showed no differences between 
livers perfused for 1 week as compared to the control group trans￾planted after a standard short period of cold storage.
The human livers available for this inaugural study were severely 
injured and heterogeneous with respect to cold and warm ischemia 
times, underlying liver diseases, donor age, duration of intensive care 
unit treatment among other parameters (Supplementary Table 1). 
Because of an organ shortage in our country, a control group of less 
injured livers is not available, as such livers are consistently used 
for transplantation27,28. The heterogeneity and poor quality of the 
livers poses difficulties in assessing the outcome overall. However, 
the many measurements obtained throughout the 1-week perfusion 
at 34 °C suggest that many of the livers maintained viability and to 
some extent recovered from prepreservation and initial ischemia–
reperfusion injuries following connection to the machine.
In addition, several parameters of viability remain difficult to 
assess, such as the long-term viability of intrahepatic bile ducts. The 
development of bile duct strictures occurs in some grafts up to 1 year 
after transplantation, typically as a result of prolonged warm isch￾emic injury29. Previous studies suggested glucose clearance in bile as 
a sign of cholangiocyte viability4,30, proposing a bile/perfusate glu￾cose ratio less than 0.7 as a cut off for predicting viability30. Notably, 
these criteria were all met in our perfused livers (Supplementary 
Fig. 8). The final proof of bile duct integrity, however, can only be 
assessed after transplantation of perfused livers in recipients with at 
least a 1-year follow-up29. Similarly, coagulation, an additional typi￾cal parameter of liver synthesis31, was difficult to monitor during ex 
vivo perfusion. Interpretation of factor V and international normal￾ized ratio (INR) during ex vivo perfusion is limited owing to the 
heparinised circuit32.
Therefore, we interpreted liver function by a combination of 
ATP synthesis, bile flow, ammonia clearance and BUN production, 
as well as by the need for glucose substitution, which is another 
well-known marker of irreversible hepatocellular injury. These 
parameters were combined with the response of the livers to added 
vasoconstrictors, as failing liver grafts are frequently characterized 
by severe vasoplegia, requiring high dosages of vasoconstrictors to 
maintain adequate blood flow in the clinical setting33. Some livers 
became unresponsive to vasoconstrictors during the perfusion 
course. The reason for failure in those livers probably relates to 
excessive warm or cold ischemia times, in combination with prep￾reservation injury recognized in the clinic as extended graft criteria, 
enhancing severe ischemia–reperfusion injury17. In Fig. 5, we sum￾marize our current understanding of how to best assess liver func￾tion and viability during ex vivo perfusion. Besides the conventional 
parameters (that is, lactate clearance, perfusate pH and bile produc￾tion) as previously proposed4,34–36, we rely on the response to glyco￾lytic hormones, vasoactive drugs and on clearance of ammonia, as 
well as histology and ATP synthesis.
Bile production, which is one of the most convincing indicators 
of liver viability after transplantation31, was present in the majority 
of livers perfused for 1 week.
Some of the human livers perfused for 1 week displayed a course 
of laboratory parameters and histology that was similar to those 
observed in the clinical setting of liver transplantation. For example, 
as in some of the livers perfused for 1 week, AST and ALT levels 
peak at around day 1, likely owing to some hepatocyte injury upon 
reperfusion, but decline rapidly thereafter similar to successful 
clinical liver transplantation31,37. Likewise, blood bilirubin increased 
during ex vivo perfusion with a delay in some livers as compared to 
liver enzymes37.
We did observe that the perfused livers consistently lost weight 
during the 7-d perfusion period, reaching about 25% of the initial 
graft mass. While the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance 
of this finding remains unclear, we speculate that this phenomenon 
is largely related to recovery of mainly cellular swelling in injured 
livers, and therefore without negative impact on hepatic func￾tion. Similarly, the well-established circadian liver weight fluctua￾tion has no negative impact on hepatic function38. Of note, we did 
not observe any weight change when using healthy pig livers 
(preperfusion weight of 1.7±0.03 kg, post-perfusion weight 
1.6±0.1 kg). A similar loss of liver weight without substantial 
impact on function has been observed during short-term normo￾thermic perfusion of livers from donations after circulatory death 
or steatotic liver grafts12.
We grouped the livers on the basis of organ viability and pre￾served integrity on histology on 1-week perfusion. Livers 7 to 10 
failed to reach the targeted perfusion duration developing signs of 
progressive liver failure, which required premature termination of 
perfusion. The observation of failure to respond to hormones and 
vasoactive drugs, loss of integrity on histology, as well as the absence 
of decline in injury and inflammation markers in perfusate in failed 
livers, offered a solid base to assess viability in long-term liver 
perfusion. These parameters may be advantageous over conven￾tionally used liver function parameters in the clinic and in selection 
of grafts for transplantation (Fig. 5), which were not substantially 
different in our system. However, further studies will be needed to 
determine which are the best measures of liver viability after long￾term perfusion.
Overall, the results in group 1 livers (livers 1 to 6) are promising 
and suggest that machine perfusion for 1 week may support viabil￾ity of human livers, although testing with higher-quality livers and 
transplantation of perfused livers into recipients will be required to 
fully assess the potential of our approach.
In ischemia–reperfusion injury, reoxygenation of ischemic 
cells triggers a burst of reactive oxygen species, which are released 
mainly by mitochondria25. Consequently, machine perfusion strat￾egies should target primarily mitochondrial metabolism39, for 
example, by applying membrane-permeable scavengers and revers￾ible inhibitors of electron transfer, or by prevention of the open￾ing of permeability transition pores. An ex vivo system offers the 
potential advantage of avoiding such undesirable systemic effects 
in the recipient. We envision our technology being used primarily 
with organs currently declined for transplantation, with long-term

ex vivo perfusion under physiologic conditions potentially enabling 
the rescue of organs or their modification in a variety of ways. For 
example, 1-week perfusion may enable repair of severely steatotic 
livers, modification of the immunogenicity of the graft or recipient 
to induce tolerance, or treatment of tumors in livers using effec￾tive chemotherapeutic agents that are too toxic for systemic use. In 
addition, long-term perfusion would allow organs to be transported 
safely over long distances, improving worldwide organ sharing and 
logistics for transplantation in many centers1,3
. Another opportunity 
in the future might be to enable liver regeneration, with a donor 
liver split into several anatomic segments to regrow in the machine. 
Recent surgical procedures have shown that massive liver regenera￾tion in humans can occur within 6d of major tissue loss7
. If feasible, 
such an approach could double or even triple the availability of 
organs for transplantation. We may also imagine the use of partial 
grafts for auto-transplantation in patients with liver cancer, obviat￾ing the need for immune suppression.
In summary, this study introduces a perfusion technology devel￾oped by a group of surgeons, biologists and engineers that enables 
maintenance of injured human livers in a functional state for 1 week 
ex vivo. With further testing to demonstrate its use with injured liv￾ers and long-term transplantation success, this machine may pro￾vide an avenue for providing more patients with liver grafts.

Methods
Human livers. Ten human livers were obtained for research after being declined 
for transplantation nationwide and after consent was obtained from the next of kin. 
The local ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich approved the study protocol 
(2017-000412). The declined livers were procured in a standardized technique 
using IGL-1 for cooling and preservation. Some livers from donations after 
circulatory death were declined after initial hypothermic oxygenated liver machine 
perfusion for clinical purpose28 (Supplementary Table 1). During setup of the 
perfusion machine, the livers were prepared on the back table including removal 
of the gall bladder and cannulation of the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava 
and bile duct. Shortly before the start of liver perfusion, the preservation solution 
was flushed out with 2 l of cold (4 °C) Ringerfundin solution (B. Braun Melsungen) 
through the portal vein (1.5 l) and hepatic artery (0.5 l).
Perfusion machine and protocol for human livers. Hemodynamic control. One 
centrifugal pump (Thoratec CentriMag) in combination with three pinch valves 
(Resolution Air MPPV-8) were used to maintain the desired flow or pressure 
conditions in the perfusion system. Flow sensors (Sonoflow CO.56) and pressure 
sensors (PendoTECH Single Use Pressure Sensors) measured flow and pressure in 
the respective silicon tube (RAUMEDIC) lines. Thereby, the control system aimed 
to maintain a desired flow (for example, 1 lmin−1
) in the portal vein and the desired 
pressure conditions in the hepatic artery. To increase its resistance and provide the 
required flow rate ratio between the portal vein and hepatic artery, a pinch valve 
clamps the tube leading to the portal vein. In the hepatic artery, a pulsatile flow was 
applied targeting an MAP of at least 65mmHg (for example, systolic and diastolic 
pressure of 80mmHg to 50mmHg respectively with 60 beats per minute), while 
limiting the mean hepatic-artery flow to a maximum of 0.6 lmin−1
. Pulsatile flow in 
the hepatic artery was realized by pulsatile operation (varying rotational speed) of 
the blood pump. Thereby, the rotational speed of the pump was defined in the same 
waveform as the desired arterial pressure pulse.
To prevent the flow in the hepatic artery from exceeding 0.6 lmin−1
, the system 
injected the vasoconstrictor Neo Synephrine HCL (phenylephrine, Ospedalia) 
at an upper bound of 0.55 lmin−1
. On the other hand, to maintain a lower limit 
at least 0.25 lmin−1
, the system injected the vasodilator Flolan (epoprostenol, 
GlaxoSmithKline). In both cases, this was realized by means of a proportional 
integral controller, defining the infusion rate on the basis of the measured hepatic￾artery flow rate.
Vena cava pressure control. Inadequate blood outflow from the liver leads to 
a vascular congestion and an ischemic hepatocellular damage. Thus, the 
system controlled the vena cava pressure around the atmospheric pressure 
(approximately 0mmHg).
The vena cava was connected via tube set directly to the blood reservoir. 
By means of the height difference between the liver and the reservoir, a suction 
pressure was induced and additionally controlled through a pinch valve between 
the vena cava and the reservoir to control a desired vena cava pressure. The pinch 
valve induced an additional pressure drop, allowing elevation of the pressure at 
the vena cava to the desired levels. If the blood pressure inside the vena cava was 
lower than the surrounding ambient pressure, the vessel wall collapsed (usually 
around 0mmHg), closed shortly and therefore induced a certain (negative) 
pressure fluctuation in the VC line. This induced pressure fluctuation was utilized 
in the control system to target the desired vena cava pressure. Finally, this pressure 
fluctuation (collapse of the vena cava) was detected by the pressure sensor in the 
vena cava line, with the control system reacting accordingly by closing the pinch 
valve in the vena cava line and thereby increasing the target vena cava pressure 
automatically by 1mmHg, slightly above the fluctuation point. The system 
continuously monitored the minimum and maximum value of the vena cava 
pressure of the last 30 s. If the difference between the minimum and maximum 
vena cava pressure in this time interval was greater than a certain threshold defined 
by the system (usually 10mmHg), a fluctuation was detected. Afterward, the 
control system immediately increased the pressure in the vena cava line by a value 
of 1mmHg, as described above. During normal operation, the system continuously 
searched for the fluctuation point. This was done by permanently decreasing the 
pressure set point for the vena cava by a rate of 1mmHg per hour. Once fluctuation 
had been detected, the set point was again increased using the algorithm described 
above, and the system again began to search for the fluctuation pressure. This 
control strategy was implemented owing to the fact that the pressure distribution 
inside the vena cava line depended on the flow rate and therefore the vena cava 
pressure was also flow-rate dependent. During the perfusion duration, the total 
flow rate through the vena cava line always varied over time. Therefore, a steady 
search for the fluctuation point was implemented (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Feedback-controlled injection of insulin and glucagon. An online glucose sensor 
(CITSens Bio Glucose Sensor, C-CIT Sensor) was integrated into the arterial line 
for real-time perfusate glucose measurement. The integrated sensor continuously 
measured the glucose in the perfusate. The blood glucose level was kept in a 
range defined by the user. If the blood glucose value surpassed the desired level, 
the system automatically injected insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk Pharma), or, 
if the blood glucose undershot a lower threshold, the system injected glucagon 
(GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk Pharma) in a closed-loop manner to maintain the 
perfusate glucose in a defined range. Both hormones can be kept at a basal rate 
as defined by the user. The injection rate of insulin was in the range of 0.02 to 
4.5 IUh−1
 depending on perfusate glucose level. The glucagon was injected at rates 
of 0.02 to 0.5 IUh−1
.
Blood-gas analysis and control. By the use of an oxygenator (Medos Hilite 2400 LT) 
and three individual gas-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Schweiz) for oxygen, 
nitrogen and CO2, the partial oxygen pressure (pO2), partial CO2 pressure (pCO2) 
and pH of the blood were controlled. An online blood-gas sensor (Terumo CDI 
500 Shunt Sensor) continuously measured pO2, pCO2 and pH. A proportional 
integral controller defined the oxygen concentration in the gas supply of the 
oxygenator to maintain pO2 at the desired level (10–12 kPa). Another proportional 
integral controller defined the total gas flow rate (oxygen and nitrogen) to control 
the wash-out rate of pCO2 in the perfusate. With CO2 being present in its dissolved 
form as carbonic acid in the blood, the pCO2 level could be manipulated to 
vary pH in a certain range. The pCO2 was allowed to vary from 4.5 to 6.5 kPa to 
maintain a target pH of around 7.4. With the inverse proportionality between 
pCO2 and pH, an increasing pCO2 lead to a decrease in pH, that is, the blood 
became more acidic. Therefore, to reduce the pH, less pCO2 was washed out by 
reducing the total gas flow rate through the oxygenator, resulting in an increase 
of pCO2. The control was implemented by means of a control cascade with the 
inner control loop maintaining the secondary target pCO2 and the outer control 
loop maintaining the primary target pH of 7.4 by varying the pCO2 set point 
in the defined range of 4.5 to 6.5 kPa. CO2 was only supplied in the gas stream to 
the oxygenator before starting the liver perfusion and in the initial phase until 
the liver produced enough CO2 to maintain the target pCO2 in the blood. In the 
normal perfusion phase, a surplus of CO2 is produced by the liver, requiring it 
to be washed out.
Physiologic oxygen saturation in portal vein. In the in vivo situation, the portal 
vein originates from the intestinal organs and, therefore, contains less oxygen as 
compared to the hepatic artery. To mimic the physiologically reduced oxygen 
saturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir was mixed with 
a portion of arterial blood leaving the oxygenator. For this purpose, the pO2
was measured in the portal vein by means of an online blood-gas sensor (Shunt 
Sensor, Terumo, CDI 500) as stated above. In addition, the system continuously 
monitored the oxygen saturation in the vena cava (vSO2) using a saturation sensor 
(CDI H/S Cuvette, Terumo, CDI 500). To mimic the physiological venous oxygen 
saturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir (blood from the vena 
cava with low, venous saturation) bypassed the oxygenator and was mixed with 
a portion of the arterial blood from the oxygenator to achieve desired saturation 
levels. The control was realized by means of a cascaded control. The inner control 
loop controlled the blood flow rate of the oxygenated blood (arterial blood) and 
the ‘bypass flow rate’ by means of a continuous pinch valve. The outer control 
loop controlled the oxygen saturation of the vena cava by varying the set point of 
the bypass flow rate. The goal was to keep a stable oxygenation level in the vena 
cava of 65% by varying the portal vein oxygen content. The total flow rate in the 
portal vein was maintained at 1 lmin−1
. An increase of flow in the bypass was 
automatically compensated to maintain a constant total flow rate in the portal vein.
Feedback-controlled dialysis. A dialysis loop has been integrated into the perfusion 
system to supply and/or remove electrolytes, bicarbonates and metabolic waste 
products. By defining the TMF of fluid across the dialysis filter, dialysis was further 
utilized to control the blood hematocrit level by adding or removing fluid from the 
perfusion loop. A roller pump with multiple individual channels (Ismatec Reglo 
ICC) controlled the inflow and outflow of dialysate to the dialysis filter (Ultraflux 
AV-Paed, Fresenius Medical Care), thereby allowing the system to define the TMF. 
The targeted TMF was defined by the user or the controller of the system. Usually, 
the TMF was in the range of −100mlh−1
 to 100mlh−1
. By controlling the TMF, the 
system can vary the amount of blood plasma in the perfusate and, thus, control 
the hematocrit level in perfusate. For this purpose, the control system used the 
continuous hematocrit measurement from the Terumo CDI 500 Cuvette sensor in 
the vena cava line.
Perfusate components and additives. The perfusate consisted of blood-group￾matched human red blood cells (approximately 1.4 l), fresh frozen plasma 
(approximately 0.8 l) and 1 unit of platelets from the human blood bank. A heparin 
bolus (5000U) was given at the start of perfusion. Albumin was added until it 
reached reference range (>2.0 g l
−1
). As soon as the tube set was primed with the 
perfusate, the dialysate (multiBIC, Fresenius Medical Care) flow rate to and from 
the dialysis filter was set at a rate of 1,000–2,000mlh−1
 to correct electrolytes and 
pH before connection of the liver to the perfusion system. The liver was connected 
to the system when sodium was in physiologic range and pH was around 7.2. 
Bicarbonates (sodium hydrogen carbonate 8.4%, B. Braun Melsungen) were also 
used to correct pH at dialysis start if pH was below 7.0. During liver perfusion, the 
dialysate inflow rate to the dialysis filter was typically set to 200mlh−1
. Dialysis 
outflow (leaving dialysis filter) rate was adjusted automatically by the control 
system depending on the measured hematocrit level. All the components of the 
perfusate are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

Pig livers. The experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Animal 
Protection Law and Ordinance. Female land race pigs (around 90 kg) were 
obtained 1 week before surgery to allow acclimatization. The pigs were fasted 
overnight before the experiment with free access to water. The pigs were sedated 
with ketamine (Ketasol-100, 15mg kg−1
), azaperon (Stresnil, 2mg kg−1
) and 
atropinsulfate (Atropin 1%, 0.05mg kg−1
). General anesthesia was maintained with 
isoflurane (Attane, 1–2%) and propofol (Propofol Lipuro 1%, 3–5mg kg−1h−1
). 
Laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The hepatic artery and 
portal vein were isolated for flow measurement with VeriQ (Medistim Germany 
GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Flow in the hepatic 
artery was measured distal to the splenic artery and after ligating gastric branches. 
Physiologic in vivo vascular flow rates in pigs for the hepatic artery and portal vein, 
measured at the time of organ procurement, were 0.25±0.07 lmin−1
 (n=5) and 
1.0±0.2 lmin−1
 (n=5), respectively. These values served therefore as a reference 
for the ex vivo setting. Heparin (200 IUkg−1
) was administered and the aorta 
was cannulated. Pig livers and blood were procured in standardized fashion22. 
Livers were connected to the perfusion machine after back-table preparation 
of the vessels (hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile duct). The circuit 
was primed with autologous, leukocyte-depleted pig blood (around 2.7 l) with 
addition of albumin (200ml, 20% solvent), bicarbonates (20ml), calcium gluconate 
(10ml), piperacillinum–tazobactamum (2.2 g) and methylprednisolon (500mg). 
The perfusion technology was developed in a step-by-step approach with the 
following stages as reported in the results section: glucose metabolism; minimizing 
hemolysis; electrolyte control; physiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal 
vein; and liver movement. Pig livers were transplanted after ex vivo perfusion 
according to a previously established protocol22.
Sampling. Blood samples were taken before the start of perfusion, every 15min 
during the first hours of perfusion and hourly for the next 5h. Thereafter, blood 
sampling was performed daily. Tissue samples (liver biopsies) were collected before 
the start of perfusion, after 3 and 6h of perfusion and afterward on a daily basis. 
Bile was sampled daily.
Measurements. Perfusate. Blood-gas analysis from arterial (hepatic artery), portal 
(portal vein) and caval (vena cava) lines was performed using the Radiometer 
ABL90 FLEX. The blood-gas analysis data were used to calibrate the glucose 
sensor and the online sensors of the Terumo, CDI 500 device. A Piccolo Xpress 
analyzer (Abaxis) was used for the quantitative determination of BUN, albumin, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, total bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase 
and alkaline phosphatase using the Piccolo general chemistry 13 panel (Abaxis). 
Ammonia levels were determined with the PocketChem BA (PA-4140, Arkray). 
Factor V was measured by the clinical laboratory of the University Hospital Zurich.
Plasma from perfusate. Plasma samples were obtained from the blood-based 
perfusate by centrifugation using standard protocol and snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen for further analysis (long-term preservation at −80 °C). Free hemoglobin 
was measured spectrometrically assay using Drabkin solution (D5941, Sigma). 
The cytokine levels in the plasma were analyzed using LEGENDplex Human 
Inflammation Panel (740118, Biolegend). Fifty microliters of plasma were assayed 
following the manufacturer’s instruction. In human livers 7 to 10, the upper 
measurable limit of the analytical method was taken for statistical analysis, because 
this value was exceeded. 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (KA0444, Abnova) for DNA 
damage and cytochrome C (CSB-EL006328PI, Cusabio) for mitochondrial injury 
were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendation.
Tissue. Tissue biopsies were taken at different time points and positions before 
and during perfusion using standard protocols, and either stored in formalin for 
histological analysis or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for 
further analysis.
Histology. The following staining procedures were performed on random 3-µm￾thick paraffin-embedded liver sections: hematoxylin and eosin, cleaved caspase 3 
(9661S, Cell Signaling) staining as an apoptosis marker, von Willebrand Factor 
(IR527, DAKO) for endothelial cell activation, Ki-67 staining as a proliferation 
marker in bile ducts (IR626, DAKO), pH3 staining as a mitosis marker (M-06-
570-3KL, Milipore), CD68 staining for liver macrophages (M0876, DAKO) and 
cytokeratin 7 staining for bile ducts (DAKO). PAS staining was performed for 
qualitative analysis of glycogen content.
Frozen tissue. Total RNA was extracted from 10mg of liver tissue using RNeasy 
Mini kit (Qiagen) including a DNAse I digestion step (RNase-free DNase set, 
Quiagen) on column. The purified RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the 
qScript cDNA SuperMix reagent (VWR). TaqMan gene-expression assays and 
an 18S rRNA internal control (TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents) were 
from PE Applied Biosystems. Sequence amplification and data analysis were 
performed on the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detector system (PE Applied 
Biosystems). Taqman gene-expression assays used were Ss03384604_u1 for 
porcine IL6, Ss03382372_u1 for porcine IL10, Ss03392385_m1 for porcine ICAM1, 
Hs00164932_m1 for human ICAM1 and 4308329 for 18S rRNA. The expression 
values were normalized to the sample at the perfusion start. Intrahepatic glycogen 
content was determined using the Glycogen Assay kit (MAK016, Sigma) following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein was extracted from tissue (10mg) in 
RIPA buffer using the standard protocol. Protein quantification and immunoblots 
were performed using Biorad protocols and systems, and the antibodies used were 
phospho-Akt (S472) (9271S, Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (2125S, Cell Signaling), 
phospho-GSK3β (S9) (5558S, Cell Signaling) and GSK3β (12456S, Cell Signaling). 
Mitochondrial function was analyzed by liver ATP content using ENLITEN 
rLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent (FF2021, Promega). In brief, the frozen tissue 
(10mg) was homogenized in 1.0ml of ice‐cold TBS buffer and deproteinized using 
a TCA kit (ab204708, Abcam). One hundred microliters of diluted supernatant 
were assayed by addition of 50μl of ATP monitoring reagent. Luminiscence 
kinetics of samples and ATP standards (Sigma) were measured using a Citation 3 
imaging reader (Biotek). ATP concentrations were extrapolated from the reading of 
the kinetic showing better regression of the calibration curve and normalized with 
the protein content in the samples before deproteinization.
Bile. DRI-CHEM 4000i (Fujifilm) was used for quantitative determination of total 
bilirubin. Bile glucose was measured using a Radiometer ABL90 FLEX device.
Statistics. Data collection and graphs were performed with Matlab R2017a 
(MathWorks). The data from different experiments were bundled at the same 
time points. Data points were bundled to a set when at least two data points of 
individual experiments were available. Then, the mean and s.d. of the bundled 
data points was calculated. Owing to logistical reasons, the daily sampling of the 
various experiments could not be conducted at exactly the same times, therefore 
they were also bundled over a time period of a ±9h. For comparison of two 
groups, two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Data were reported as mean±s.d. 
P<0.05 was considered as significant. Exact sample size (n) for each experimental 
group and units of measurement were provided in the text and figure captions. No 
assumptions or corrections were applied in statistical analysis. Further details on 
statistics are available online in the Reporting Summary.
