Personalizing guidelines for diabetes
management: twilight or dawn of the expert?
Stavroula A Paschou1 and Richard David Leslie2*
Abstract
Background: This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of
guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and
make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.
Discussion: Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted
a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with
limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local
funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the
disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The
strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an
assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then
veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual.
Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)
xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.
Summary: Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered,
multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.
Keywords: Type 2 diabetes, Guidelines, Personalised treatment, Diabetes management, Patient-centered therapy
Background
Ancient Greek Hippocrates (c. 460 BC to c. 370 BC)
advised physicians for patients: ‘ωφελέειν ή μη βλάπτειν’,
‘to do good or to do no harm'. Modern physicians take
the Hippocratic Oath in its various forms, but remain
committed to the risk-benefit ratio implicit in this state￾ment, to the overall benefit of their patients.
Diabetes is a complex disease characterized by deteri￾oration of glycaemia and co-morbidity. In adult patients,
the comorbidity is often the result of a risk factor
spectrum associated with a high proportion of cases and
broadly identified as the Metabolic Syndrome, with the
clustering of obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia, as
well as hyperglycemia [1-5]. In contrast to disease nos￾ology, therapies have no identity, only a mode of action,
a list of side-effects and a financial cost. Today we have
many drugs in our armamentarium to treat type 2
diabetes, but many of these drugs are relatively new. So,
deciding which direction to take for any given patient,
even whether to use drugs at all, is akin to standing on
shifting sands. That decision is further complicated by
the delicate risk-benefit balance, highlighted by recent
intervention trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT) [6-8].
In this opinion article we will tackle these issues as
handled by the rash of recent guidelines. In one sense
this dawn of the guidelines could spell the twilight of the
professional, for guidelines are presented as simple
guides to patient management to be applied by health
care providers who are not experts in diabetes manage￾ment. Such guidelines raise the important question as to
whether diabetes management can be formulaic or
whether it must be professional and patient-centered.
Importantly, this review is not a guideline. Indeed, our
aim is to highlight the limitations of guidelines. In short,
it is to herald a return to the personal professional care
provided by an expert, without recourse to centralized
broad strategies.

Discussion
Overarching strategy
Patients with diabetes are at risk of macrovascular and
microvascular disease [7,8]. Strikingly, the risk factors
for these complications are similar. However, factors
associated with macrovascular disease tend to be most
strongly associated with insulin resistance and the meta￾bolic syndrome, that is, obesity, dyslipidemia and hyper￾tension while hyperglycemia is the dominant factor
associated with microvascular disease. It follows that the
management of diabetes resolves around the manage￾ment of multiple risk factors, notably when treating
patients with type 2 diabetes [1-5]. Therapeutic plans for
managing non-insulin requiring diabetes are: anecdotal
and historical (often), evidence-based (infrequently) or
outcome based (rarely). Such plans usually offer a broad
guide for the generality of patients, but recently encom￾pass a more ‘personalised’ approach which is targeted to
specific qualities of each individual [9,10]. Since there
are multiple risk factors to consider for each individual
and we are focusing here on hyperglycemia alone, it fol￾lows that the strategy to be employed is complex. Two
decisions must be made initially: the appropriate target
of therapy and the appropriate therapeutic strategy.
Appropriate therapeutic targets
Hyperglycemia is usually determined using glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c), an index of average blood glu￾cose levels over two to three months, determined by the
percentage of haemoglobin with an adduct of glucose.
Therapeutic targets should vary from patient to patient.
For optimum diabetes control an HbA1c value of less
than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) is widely proposed [1-5].
However, for patients who are older, of longer disease
duration or with complications, such strict targets are
not validated and there is a move towards a more flex￾ible approach for a given individual – so-called personal￾ized medicine [9,10]. The target HbA1c will then
determine the nature of the therapy and that target can
be modified according to both diabetes duration and co￾morbidities.
Targets can determine therapy
The glucose-lowering effectiveness of agents varies, so the
degree of HbA1c reduction sought will impact the decision
as to which agent to use. Insulin aside, the efficacy is high
for metformin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones
(glitazones) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists
(expected HbA1c reduction approximately 1.0 to 1.5%)
and, generally, lower for meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase￾4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, acarbose, colesevelam and bromocrip￾tine (approximately 0.5 to 1.0%) (Table 1). Historically,
older drugs have typically been tested in clinical trial partic￾ipants with higher baseline HbA1c, so, without direct
comparisons, it is difficult to be certain that SUs, for ex￾ample, really are more or less effective that DPP-4 inhibi￾tors or GLP-1 agonists; but these latter are consistently
found not to be inferior to SUs, with the added benefit of
no weight gain, even weight loss, without hypoglycemia
[1,11-18]. Agents with more modest effects, but little or no
side-effects, could be considered when treating individuals
with impaired glucose tolerance, to limit progression to
frank diabetes, for example, acarbose, though it is prone to
cause flatulence [9].
Insulin is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes because
numerous studies indicate that it works. However, it car￾ries a risk of both hypoglycemia and weight gain, two crit￾ical issues in assessing the value of any given therapy. The
fall in HbA1c comes at a cost of rising hypoglycemia-risk,
and analogues of long-acting and short-acting insulin re￾duce nocturnal hypoglycemia and post-prandial glucose,
respectively, without benefiting HbA1c levels. GLP-1 ago￾nists are as effective as insulin at reducing HbA1c, with
the additional benefit of weight loss without hypoglycemia,
but then a proportion of cases develop nausea and acute
pancreatitis is, possibly, an additional, albeit very small,
risk [17]. Initial insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes patients
is unusual unless the patient is markedly hyperglycemic
and/or symptomatic [3,9,10,12]. Patients with ketosis
prone diabetes (KPD) are in the category of those who
present with ketocidosis but after initial insulin therapy
can stop insulin and revert to tablet treatment [19]. The
ORIGIN trial failed to find a role for low-dose insulin
therapy early in the course of type 2 diabetes, in that insu￾lin treatment did not reduce cardiovascular risk [20].
Approaches to insulin therapy include three regimes: a
single injection of basal insulin, multiple prandial insulin
injections and two injections of biphasic insulin. The
only trial comparing these regimens concluded that
basal and prandial insulin each provide better glucose
control than the biphasic insulin regimen, while basal in￾sulin benefits from fewer hypoglycemic episodes and less
weight gain [21]; however, many patients taking basal in￾sulin were also taking prandial insulin in this three-year
comparison study. Comparison at one year, when pa￾tients were on their assigned insulin only, indicated that
basal insulin was inferior in lowering HbA1c to prandial
insulin or mixed insulins given twice daily [21]. Basal in￾sulin alone tends to be used initially, but twice daily in￾jections using either pre-mixed insulin or a long-acting
insulin with a single prandial injection are a reasonable
second-line of therapy, short of progressing to four daily
injections [21].
Targets modified by co-morbidities While target
HbA1c levels can be specified in guidelines, these levels
are modified by comorbidities, so it is important to
take other diseases into account. In patients without

established complications and with short disease dur￾ation, both the risk of microvascular and macrovascular
disease is reduced by lowering HbA1c (every approxi￾mately 1% HbA1c reduction is associated with a 25%
relative risk reduction for microvascular disease progres￾sion) [22-30]. Targets are also affected by diabetic retin￾opathy, which is a serious complication of diabetes.
Recommendations tend to suggest obtaining better glu￾cose control in the presence of retinopathy than in those
without retinopathy [25,26].
Cardiovascular complications are important consider￾ations when patients are given HbA1c-lowering therapy.
A meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcomes in major
trials suggested that every approximately 1% HbA1c re￾duction is associated with a 15% relative risk reduction
in non-fatal myocardial infarction, but without benefit
on stroke or all-cause mortality [28] while the same
HbA1c reduction is associated with a 37% risk reduction
in microvascular complications [26].
Targets and duration of disease Disease duration should
be considered when defining HbA1c targets. Early strict
glycaemic control prevents micro- and macrovascular
complications [22]. Analyses of recent intervention trials
in type 2 diabetes indicate that the shorter the disease
duration the greater the cardiovascular protection of￾fered by strict glycemic control. Once disease duration is
more than 10 to 12 years, that beneficial effect may be
lost, may even become detrimental [27-30]. On the other
hand, post hoc analysis of some data suggests that bene￾fits of glycaemic control are likely to occur in patients
before the development of clinical cardiovascular disease
regardless of the duration of their disease [30]. In young
patients, reducing the long-term risk of complications,
while ensuring optimal energy metabolism, demands
more strict HbA1c targets. Therefore, we should achieve
lower targets and get there faster in younger patients [9]
while we should aim for safer targets and achieve them
more slowly in older patients [9].
Advanced microvascular complications are difficult to
reverse and, by implication, the same is true of established
macrovascular disease. Therefore, patients with major
micro- and macrovascular complications should not be
given strict HbA1c targets. However, in patients with
background retinopathy, irrespective of other vascular
disease, progression of retinopathy can be limited by con￾trolling HbA1c so, in these patients, a strict HbA1c target
could be beneficial [25,26]. Less strict HbA1c goals
can be considered for patients with a history of severe
hypoglycemia, advanced complications, co-morbid dis￾eases and when life expectancy is limited. When it is diffi￾cult to achieve targets, despite intensive efforts, it is
important to modify the treatment goals, remembering
that the risk of complications with increasing HbA1c is
exponential, so that a 1% reduction of HbA1c from
10.0 to 9.0% (84 to 75 mmol/mol) should be more effect￾ive than an HbA1c reduction from 8.0 to 7.0% (64 to 53
mmol/mol) [26]. Taking all these factors into account, it is
important to analyze comorbidities in individual patients
in order to determine the optimum HbA1c target levels.
Appropriate therapy
As is the case for targets of therapy, so the best drug
treatment will vary between patients.
Step-up or step-down
Guidelines tend to be based on: step-up therapy by drug
numbers; step-up therapy by intensification of drug
action; single risk factor (for example, hyperglycemia or
hypertension, but not both); specific and universal tar￾gets (for example, HbA1c 7.0%); and the consideration
of type 2 diabetes as a single disease [9,31-33]. However,
the stepwise addition of oral agents and/or insulin con￾trasts with other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis
or gout, in which initial management is intense and, sub￾sequently, more modest – a step-down approach [34,35].
We adopt a step-down approach when a patient presents
with marked hyperglycemia (for example, HbA1c ≥9.0%)
in which case insulin, unless poorly tolerated or contra￾indicated, is combined with or without metformin. How￾ever, some therapies, other than insulin, can be effective
even when HbA1c is high, for example, GLP-1 agonists
(for options see Table 1).
At least one recent study has taken a step-down ap￾proach to initial intensive therapy, using a combination
of drugs at low dose, but final results of that study are
awaited [31]. Some 30 years ago in the USA only insulin
was available for treatment of diabetes for those unre￾sponsive to diet and exercise alone. Metformin was
tarred by association with phenformin, and SUs had
been vilified in the, now broadly discredited, University
Diabetes Group Program [36]. The strategic problems
we now face have come about through the success of
the pharmaceutical industry. The medical profession
must resolve how best to utilize this array of drugs and
injectables.
Step-up hierarchy
Management of type 2 diabetes, once life-style interven￾tion has failed, usually involves the introduction of
metformin [9,10]. Some people still prefer insulin, even
at this stage. As drugs fail, other agents are introduced,
historically SUs and then insulin but the broad range of
alternative therapies has led to a more flexible approach
towards second and third line therapy.
Durability of drug action is an important consideration
in the management of type 2 diabetes, but is not broadly
considered in guidelines owing to the lack of alternatives
Paschou and Leslie BMC Medicine 2013, 11:161 Page 4 of 9

[37]. The reduction in beta-cell function, both before
and after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, is the likely cause
of the progressive rise in HbA1c following diagnosis
[37]. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), all
therapies (insulin, metformin, SUs, lifestyle) were associ￾ated with an increasing HbA1c. In other words, all drugs
failed in time, of which SUs, initially the most effective,
were the worst [26]. It remains possible that new drugs,
such as glitazones, GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibi￾tors may preserve beta cell function, although clear
proof of this is awaited [9,37].
Multiple targets and outcomes
Since type 2 diabetes involves multiple risk factors, it fol￾lows that therapy also involves multiple targets, multiple
potential outcomes and multiple drugs to achieve those
targets for each individual. Guidelines rarely consider the
interrelationship between multiple therapeutic options,
but do consider the list of modifiable risk factors includ￾ing: blood pressure and lipid therapy, anti-platelet treat￾ment and smoking cessation. For example, fenofibrate, a
lipid-lowering agent, may also be beneficial in limiting the
progression of retinopathy [38].
Most drug trials focus on lowering of blood glucose,
weight loss and hypoglycemia, whilst omitting outcome in
terms of macrovascular and microvascular disease [13-18].
Therefore, where these results are available from major
outcome studies (for example, UKPDS and Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)) they have
dominated current management [39-42]. Central to the
successful implementation of each treatment has been the
reduction of HbA1c, although both hypoglycemia risk and
patient preference are often ignored beyond severe
hypoglycemia. For example, the most successful therapy
to reduce blood glucose is insulin. Yet insulin is not
recommended as the initial treatment, unless hypergly￾cemia is severe, by implication because of the side-effects,
management resources and patient preference [9,10].
Similarly, SUs are initially more effective than metformin,
but the latter is more widely used at diagnosis, probably
because of the side-effects of SUs (although the frequency
of side-effects is higher with metformin) and the sugges￾tion that metformin has a beneficial effect on all-cause
mortality – at least, in the absence of SUs [22,26].
Non-insulin requiring diabetes: multiple diseases?
The heterogeneity of diabetes is such that it is difficult
to be certain of the cause of the disease in any given pa￾tient without recourse to laboratory tests. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes is a diagnosis by exclusion, that is by
exclusion of insulin-dependent diabetes. There is sub￾stantial evidence, however, that about 10% of patients,
both European and Chinese, presenting in adulthood
with diabetes that does not, at least initially, require
insulin treatment, having diabetes-associated autoanti￾bodies and the HLA genetic susceptibility and protec￾tion found in type 1 diabetes [43,44]. Moreover, other
forms of diabetes, while rare, exist and can present in
adult life including: ketosis prone diabetes (KPD), ma￾turity onset diabetes of young onset (MODY) and
haemochromatosis, as well as other forms of secondary
diabetes, for example, following steroid treatment
[9,19,42]. The heterogeneity of diabetes should be con￾sidered when selecting the most appropriate therapy for
individual patients.
SUs are probably contraindicated in patients with
adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, including latent auto￾immune diabetes of adults (LADA), due to the marked
lack of durability of their action by comparison with in￾sulin [45]. Anecdotal evidence supports the use of DPP￾4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in non-insulin requiring
adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, but formal compari￾sons are awaited. Meglitinides (or glinides) are short￾acting secretagogues that stimulate insulin release
through similar mechanisms to SUs, but may be associ￾ated with less hypoglycemia [46] (Table 1). However,
they require more frequent dosing. A particular indica￾tion, due to their modest and short action, is for patients
with type 3 MODY in whom the risk of hypoglycemia is
reduced [46]. Patients with steroid-induced diabetes
tend to have post-prandial hyperglycemia, but not
fasting hyperglycemia; they may benefit from short￾acting insulin analogues or SUs and if steroid therapy is
transient as with asthma treatment then DDP-4 inhibi￾tors could be preferable, as the risk of hypoglycemia, as
the glucose falls and treatment is withdrawn, is less than
for insulin or SUs.
Therapy and co-morbidities
The universal benefit of reducing blood glucose, irre￾spective of the agent, indicates a generic effect, likely
true for all glucose-lowering treatments. So, as outcome
studies become available, we will have to modify what￾ever position we currently take on the newer therapies.
Co-existent diseases which impact therapeutic decisions
include renal disease and macrovascular disease.
Macrovascular disease Macrovascular disease can im￾pact the use of certain drugs. Recommendations for
those with cerebrovascular disease in general match
those with cardiovascular disease; while SUs and glinides
should be avoided and glitazones have a complex role,
all other treatment options can be used to control blood
glucose as appropriate. SUs (and glinides) have been
reported to reduce myocardial blood flow and increase
early mortality after acute ischaemia [46]. In UKPDS,
SUs confounded the mortality benefit of metformin [21].
Metformin is contraindicated in patients within two

weeks after stroke (Glycaemia in Acute Stroke (GLIAS),
UK Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST-UK), Diabetes
Mellitus Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial
Infarction (DIGAMI))[47-52]. Metformin bears the add￾itional risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with
recent myocardial infarction but it is not contraindicated
in patients with cardiovascular disease; indeed, recent
studies have suggested that it may be beneficial [53-55].
Glitazones should not be used in Stage III-IV heart fail￾ure as they can exacerbate the condition. Preferred drugs
in heart failure include metformin (NYHA Stage I-II),
acarbose and GLP-1 analogs/DPP-4 inhibitors, although
the evidence base to recommend the latter is weak
[56-61]. Of the glitazones, pioglitazone remains an agent
whose precise role is to be determined [61,62] but which
appeared to have a modest benefit on cardiovascular
events as a secondary outcome in one large trial (Pro￾Active) [62], although with weight gain as a substantial
side-effect and bladder cancer as a potential problem
[63] (Table 1). Rosiglitazone is no longer available due to
a postulated, and disputed, increased myocardial infarc￾tion risk [64].
Impaired renal function When renal function is im￾paired, drugs cleared by the kidney may not be cleared
appropriately, so that blood levels may increase. Metfor￾min and liraglutide are contraindicated when the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min. DPP-4
inhibitors when GFR <50 ml/min are broadly contrain￾dicated (or the dose should be adjusted) but linagliptin
can be used at all stages of renal dysfunction [65,66].
Exenatide and SUs are contraindicated when GFR <30
ml/min. Acarbose is contraindicated when GFR <25
ml/min. Insulin is generally recommended when renal
failure is advanced, linagliptin being a potential alter￾native [9,10,66].
In summary, co-morbidities can direct drug use and
drug action as well as the risk of drug side-effects. These
potential effects will vary from one drug to another and
between patients to influence therapeutic decisions.
Individualised targets and therapies
We have already discussed the need to individualize
therapeutic targets based on age, complications and
co-morbidities and disease duration; the same applies
to therapies. For all medications, consideration should
also be given to overall tolerability. Even occasional
hypoglycemia may be devastating, if severe, or merely
irritating, if mild [67].
Gastrointestinal side effects may be tolerated by some,
but not others. Fluid retention may pose a clinical but
also, an aesthetic, problem. Substantial individual vari￾ation in side-effects, as well as beneficial effects of all
agents, influences our approach to the individual case
depending on the patient’s response. At least one expert
has proposed drug-ranging trials to determine the best
positive/negative ratio for each agent in any given pa￾tient [68]. Adult patients who live alone or have occupa￾tions which preclude a degree of risk of hypoglycemia,
for example, the elderly, taxi drivers and sportsmen,
should avoid insulin, SUs and glinides and favor metfor￾min and DPP-4 inhibitors [69,70]. Pregnancy or the wish
to get pregnant will also preclude the newer drugs, as
well as statins, in that the risk associated with them to
the fetus is unknown [9,10,71].
Finally, those patients who are obese will favor agents
that are weight neutral or reduce weight, such as metfor￾min and GLP-1 agonists (Table 1). Because weight gain
can be associated with increasing risk of cardiovascular
disease, it is a side-effect physicians also wish to avoid. A
recent study showed little difference in a once daily ver￾sus once weekly preparation of GLP-1 agonist in terms
of improved HbA1c and tolerability but raised interest￾ing questions as to the perceived optimum therapy since
the once weekly therapy did not achieve as low a HbA1c
[72]. Indeed, the need for individualized therapy is
highlighted by these GLP-1 agonists which are associ￾ated in some patients with initial gastrointestinal side ef￾fects (nausea and vomiting), so that a proportion of
patients cannot tolerate them, nor do they work in at
least 25% of cases [73]. Some drug classes have greater
efficacy in obese than non-obese individuals, for ex￾ample, glitazones [73,74] while others are preferable in
marked obesity, for example, GLP-1 agonists [75]. If
body weight is successfully reduced, anti-diabetic
medication often has to be adjusted [76]. Bariatric sur￾gery, not discussed here, remains an important option
when all else fails [77,78]. In summary, the need to
individualize therapy based on age, complications, co￾morbidities and disease duration, extends to the indi￾vidual’s response to each therapy and their perception
of each therapy, for example, the fear of injections as
compared with the fear of insulin injections.
Multifaceted interaction
Whilst, at first sight, the doctor might make a decision
based on the details about the patient, in reality two
other factors are involved in that decision. First, the pa￾tients themselves bring with them a raft of prejudices
and concerns, fears and constraints, which may have
to be carefully elicited. Notable among these fears are
the fear of insulin. That fear stems from the fear
of hypoglycemia and of injections, but also from con￾cerns about weight gain or from historical issues, such
as relatives who started insulin treatment and fared
badly. Second, the funding agencies often seek to deter￾mine, by constraint or coercion, which therapies are
available or can be used. Given the substantial variation
Paschou and Leslie BMC Medicine 2013, 11:161 Page 6 of 9

in resources around the world, both in terms of access
to drugs as well as the cost of drugs, it follows that dis￾cussion of costs could only be parochial and will be
broadly avoided here. But the cheaper drugs are drugs
with a long-history (metformin, SUs and human insulin),
while more expensive drugs are those only recently
available (the rest). It follows that outcome studies,
which are available for ‘historical’ forms of treatment,
provide a justification for their use.
Summary
The definition both of the target of HbA1c as well as
therapeutic options and individual responses to therapy
can guide clinicians towards more effective, efficient and
safe treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this article we
outlined the matrix of options available to the physician
and highlighted factors critical to decision-making, with￾out setting out a precise plan, in the spirit of ‘personal￾ized’ therapy. It is our contention that the complexity of
the matrix of options precludes rigid guidelines. We ap￾preciate that this approach is less cost-effective when
compared with guidelines, which can be followed by
health care personnel without strong medical training.
In this context of increasing health care costs, guidelines
are at the end of the beginning but, for the expert, they
are not the beginning of the end.
