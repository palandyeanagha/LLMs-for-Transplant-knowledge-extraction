The kidney not only regulates fluid and electrolyte balance but also functions as an endocrine organ. For 
instance, it is the major source of circulating erythropoietin and renin. Despite currently available therapies, 
there is a marked increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients suffering from end-stage 
renal disease. We hypothesized that the current understanding of the endocrine function of the kidney was 
incomplete and that the organ might secrete additional proteins with important biological roles. Here we 
report the identification of a novel flavin adenine dinucleotide–dependent amine oxidase (renalase) that is 
secreted into the blood by the kidney and metabolizes catecholamines in vitro (renalase metabolizes dopamine 
most efficiently, followed by epinephrine, and then norepinephrine). In humans, renalase gene expression is 
highest in the kidney but is also detectable in the heart, skeletal muscle, and the small intestine. The plasma 
concentration of renalase is markedly reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease, as compared with 
healthy subjects. Renalase infusion in rats caused a decrease in cardiac contractility, heart rate, and blood 
pressure and prevented a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular tone. These results identify renalase as 
what we believe to be a novel amine oxidase that is secreted by the kidney, circulates in blood, and modulates 
cardiac function and systemic blood pressure.
Introduction
In addition to maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, the 
kidney also serves as an endocrine organ and is, for example, the main 
source of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is required for proliferation 
and terminal differentiation of erythroid progenitors and precursors 
and is a major determinant of red cell mass (1, 2, 3). The kidney is the 
most important site for the release of renin, an enzyme that cleaves 
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (4). The renin-angiotensin system 
is a key regulator of fluid and electrolyte metabolism, blood pressure, 
and cardiac function. An increase in sympathetic stimulation or a 
decrease in blood flow or in sodium chloride delivery to the distal 
tubules can stimulate the release of renin.
Patients who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are either 
treated with replacement therapy, such as peritoneal or hemodialysis, 
or receive a renal transplant. Despite the success of dialysis in pro￾longing life, the morbidity and mortality associated with this therapy 
remain high, and most patients experience a poor quality of life (5, 6). 
While the reasons for this are not entirely clear, it is generally believed 
that the procedure fails to replicate important functions of the nat￾ural organ. For instance, it is well documented that patients with 
ESRD are at significantly higher risk for developing cardiovascular 
disease, a risk that appears to be correlated with increased oxidative 
stress (7) and heightened sympathetic tone (8, 9).
We hypothesized that the current understanding of the endo￾crine function of kidney was incomplete and that the organ might 
secrete additional proteins with important biological roles. Here 
we report the identification of a novel flavin adenine dinucleo￾tide–dependent (FAD-dependent) amine oxidase (renalase) that 
is secreted into the blood by the kidney, metabolizes circulating 
catecholamines, and regulates blood pressure.
Results
Identification of renalase. In order to identify novel proteins secreted 
by the kidney, we analyzed all the clones published by the Mam￾malian Gene Collection Project (MGC) (10). As of August 1, 2003, 
there were 12,563 distinct genes derived from 77 different human 
cDNA libraries. We identified a total of 114 candidate genes 
encoding novel secretory proteins based on the following criteria: 
they encode proteins (a) with less than 20% sequence similarity/
identity to known proteins; (b) that are predicted (according to 
SignalP-2.0 and SOSUIsignal Beta Version) to contain a signal 
peptide sequence; and (c) that do not contain transmembrane 
domains (since some membrane proteins, such as type I mem￾brane proteins, also harbor a signal peptide sequence). We then 
performed Northern blot analysis to assess the tissue expression 
pattern for each gene and found 1 clone with robust and prefer￾ential expression in human kidney (MGC12474; GenBank acces￾sion number BC005364) (Figure 1A). The major band (1.5 kb) is 
visible in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. Two additional 
weaker bands are also detected; 1 is approximately 2.4 kb and 
only presents in skeletal muscle. The other is approximately 1.2 
kb and is present in kidney and liver. These mRNA species may 
represent alternative splice variants. MGC12474 has 1,474 nt, and 
Nonstandard abbreviations used: ESRD, end-stage renal disease; FAD, flavin ade￾nine dinucleotide; GST, glutathione synthase; MAO-A, monoamine oxidase A; MGC,

its longest open reading frame (nt 22–1047) encodes a novel pro￾tein with 342 AAs with a calculated molecular mass of 37.8 kDa 
(Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI200524066DS1). The cDNA 
sequence of MGC12474 was used to search the Human Genome 
Project database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/
human/), and the resulting alignment was used to establish the 
exon-intron structure of the human gene, which we have named 
renalase. Renalase has 9 exons spanning approximately 311,000 
bp and resides on chromosome 10 at q23.33. We examined the 
expression of renalase protein in rats by Western blotting using 
an anti-renalase antibody. As shown in Figure 1B, renalase pro￾tein was detected in the same tissues that were 
determined to be positive for renalase mRNA 
by Northern blotting. In situ hybridization 
and immunocytochemical studies were car￾ried out to determine the spatial distribution 
of renalase gene expression in human tissues. 
A specific signal was detected in renal glom￾eruli, proximal tubules (Figure 1, C–E), and 
cardiomyocytes (Figure 1, F and G).
Analysis, using MotifScan (http://hcv.lanl.
gov/content/hcv-db/MOTIFSCAN/Motif￾Scanner.html), revealed a signal peptide at the 
N-terminus, a FAD-binding site (AAs 4–35), and 
an amine oxidase domain at AAs 75–339 (Sup￾plemental Figure 1). Renalase has 13.2% AA 
identity with monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) 
(Supplemental Figure 2).
Renalase is a secreted protein. To test whether 
renalase is a secreted protein, we employed a 
PCR-based approach to generate transcrip￾tionally active PCR (TAP) fragments (11). In 
order to facilitate the detection of the protein 
product, we also engineered an HA tag at the 
C-terminus of renalase. HEK293 cells that had 
been transfected with a renalase TAP fragment 
were capable of secreting renalase in the cul￾ture medium. As shown in Figure 2A, Western 
blotting with both anti-HA and anti-renalase 
antibodies revealed an approximately 35-kDa 
protein in the culture medium, which indi￾cates that renalase has a functional N-terminal 
signal sequence and is secreted in the cell cul￾ture model used in these studies. We reasoned 
that if renalase is secreted in vivo, it should be 
detectable in either urine or blood. Human 
plasma was examined by Western blotting 
using a renalase-specific polyclonal antibody. 
As shown in Figure 2B, renalase was readily 
detectable in plasma of healthy individuals. To 
determine whether the kidney is an important 
source of secreted renalase, we examined the 
blood levels of renalase in patients suffering 
from severe kidney disease and decreased renal 
function. As shown in Figure 2B, renalase was 
virtually undetectable in the blood of patients 
with ESRD on hemodialysis.
Renalase degrades catecholamines in vitro and regu￾lates systemic blood pressure in vivo. Structural anal￾ysis revealed that renalase contains an amino oxidase domain (Sup￾plemental Figure 1), which suggests that it may play a role in amine 
oxidation. Therefore, we tested whether it had oxidase activity using 
a battery of amines as substrates. As shown in Figure 2C, renalase 
specifically metabolizes cathecholamines, with dopamine being the 
preferred substrate, followed by epinephrine, and then norepineph￾rine. Its enzymatic activity was unaffected by known inhibitors of the 
FAD-containing amine oxidases MAO-A and MAO-B (Figure 2D). In 
control studies, pargyline and clorgyline inhibited MAO-A activity by 
83.9% ± 2.3% (n = 3) and 82.4% ± 1.9% (n = 3), respectively.
To examine the oxidase activity of native renalase, and to verify 
the specificity of the anti-renalase antibody, we purified renalase

from human urine and studied its activity. As shown in Figure 
2E, in addition to the band of the expected size (approximately 
35 kDa), another, larger (67–75 kDa) doublet was also detected, 
and it may represent either dimerization or aggregation of the 
35-kDa band. We then used a functional assay to confirm the 
identity of the bands detected by the polyclonal antibody. The 
immunoprecipitate metabolized catecholamines with a substrate 
specificity similar to that of recombinant renalase (with dopa￾mine being the preferred substrate, followed by epinephrine, and 
then norepinephrine; n = 4). Furthermore, we found that the anti￾renalase antibody inhibited the amino oxidase activity of recom￾binant renalase by 87.3% ± 2.3% (n = 4). Since renalase circulates 
in blood and degrades catecholamines in vitro, we examined its in 
vivo effect on cardiovascular hemodynamics. As shown in Figure 
3A and Table 1, within 30 seconds of a single bolus injection of 
recombinant renalase, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pres￾sure decreased by 23.5% ± 1.3%, 32.6% ± 2.9%, and 28.9% ± 2.7% 
respectively (n = 8; P < 0.001). Blood pressure recovered to baseline 
values within 4 ± 1 minutes (n = 8). To further study the mecha￾nism of renalase-mediated hypotensive effect, we monitored a 
number of hemodynamic parameters. As shown in Figure 3, A and 
B, and detailed in Table 1, renalase decreased left-ventricular end 
systolic and end diastolic pressure, maximum left ventricular pres￾sure, and the rate of ventricular pressure change (dP/dt), a measure 
of cardiac contractility. In addition, renalase decreased heart rate, 
but peripheral vascular resistance remained unchanged. Renalase’s 
action on heart contractility and blood pressure was dose depen￾dent (Figure 3, C and D).
Discussion
Renalase is a novel FAD-containing amine oxidase. It is criti￾cally dependent on FAD for oxidase activity, since the protein 
is inactive unless the cofactor is incorporated during protein 
production (0.1 μM FAD was added to the medium during the 
production of recombinant renalase). It has weak AA similari￾ties to MAO-A and MAO-B and distinct substrate specificity and 
inhibitor profile, which indicates that it represents a new class of 
FAD-containing monoamine oxidases.
Amine oxidases are enzymes that metabolize biogenic amines 
and are classified according to the nature of the attached cofactor, 
such as FAD or topaquinone (TPQ). MAO-A and MAO-B are FAD￾containing, mitochondrial enzymes that metabolize intracellular 
catecholamines. The crystal structure of human MAO-B has been 
determined at a resolution of 3.0 Å and reveals a dimer with the 
FAD cofactor covalently bound to a cysteine side chain (Cys-397) 
(12). MAO-A and MAO-B have overlapping substrate specificity; 
catabolize neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, 
serotonin, and dopamine; and are specifically inhibited by clorgy￾line and deprenyl, respectively. Polyamine oxidase, the other known 
FAD-containing oxidase, is an intracellular oxidase that metaboliz￾es spermine and spermidine and regulates cell growth (13). Unlike 
MAO-A and MAO-B, which are anchored through the carboxyl ter￾Figure 2

minus to the outer mitochondrial membrane (14) and confined 
to intracellular compartments, renalase is secreted into the blood, 
where it is detectable by Western blotting.
Amine oxidase activity has been measured in human plasma and 
is believed to be mediated by vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), 
a copper-containing semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase that is 
secreted by smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and endothelial cells 
(15). VAP-1’s substrate specificity and inhibitor profile are very 
different from that of renalase. It metabolizes benzylamine and 
methylamine and is inhibited by semicarbazide and hydroxylamine. 
Therefore, renalase is the only known amine oxidase that is secreted 
into blood and that metabolizes circulating catecholamines.
The kidney appears to be the major source of circulating renalase, 
since the protein is nearly absent in the blood of patients with 
ESRD. This was an unexpected finding, as renalase gene and pro￾tein expression are also detectable, albeit at lower levels, in heart, 
skeletal muscle, and small intestine. Since the molecular details 
underlying the regulation of renalase secre￾tion are unknown, one cannot exclude the 
possibility that the low circulating renalase 
level in ESRD patients is due to increased 
catabolism or to a generalized decrease in 
secretion brought about by the metabolic 
abnormalities associated with severe renal 
failure, i.e. the uremic state. Nonetheless, 
it is likely that the kidney is an important 
contributor to circulating renalase pool. It 
is interesting to note that skeletal muscle 
expresses high renalase levels, which sug￾gests that the enzyme may play an important 
role in regulating local and perhaps systemic 
catecholamine concentration.
Native renalase purified from human urine is functionally active 
and retains enzymatic activity. Recombinant renalase lowers blood 
pressure when administered i.v. It is known that catecholamines 
control heart rate, myocardial contractility, and the tone of resis￾tance vessels and thus play an important role in maintaining 
blood pressure. The hemodynamic changes observed with renalase 
infusion are most likely mediated by circulating catecholamines 
degradation, which would be expected to decrease cardiac con￾tractility and heart rate. It is also possible that a significant fall in 
circulating catecholamines levels resulted in venous dilatation and 
decreased venous return. End diastolic pressure tended to be lower 
but the difference compared with control did not reach statistical 
significance. While the hypotensive effect of renalase can be fully 
accounted for by the observed decrease in contractility and heart 
rate, we cannot categorically exclude the possibility that renalase’s 
effect may be partly receptor mediated.
Renal disease is associated with a marked increase in cardiovas￾cular disease (16, 17). A number of hypotheses have been put forth 
to explain the increased frequency of cardiovascular dysfunction 
observed in patients with renal disease (18). Interestingly, some 
studies have shown that plasma dopamine and norepinephrine 
levels are consistently increased in patients with ESRD (9, 19–21). 
Those changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovas￾cular complications such as hypertension, left ventricular hyper￾trophy, and dysfunction, which are important contributors to the 
high mortality rate observed in patients with ESRD. Thus, it is 
intriguing to speculate that low plasma renalase levels may also 
contribute to the heightened circulating catecholamine levels 
observed in ESRD patients.
In conclusion, our data indicate that renalase is a novel FAD￾dependent amine oxidase that is secreted into the blood by the 
kidney. It degrades catecholamines in vitro and lowers blood 
pressure in vivo by decreasing cardiac contractility and heart 
rate and preventing a compensatory increase in peripheral vas￾cular tone. Furthermore, the decrease in blood renalase concen￾Figure 3

tration observed in patients with severe renal disease suggests a 
causal link to the increased plasma catecholamine and height￾ened cardiovascular risk that are well documented in this patient 
population. The identification of renalase is an important step 
in developing a more detailed understanding of cardiovascular 
physiology and perhaps also in the quest for providing optimal 
treatment for patients with kidney disease.
Methods
Identification and analysis of the gene encoding renalase. As of August 1, 2003, 
12,563 distinct human full-length open reading frame cDNAs were avail￾able from MGC’s website. These clones were subjected to 3 rounds of 
sequential screening. First, genes without a GenBank definition were cho￾sen for further analysis. Homology analysis was carried out using Basic 
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), 
and genes having predicted amino acid sequences with less than 20% iden￾tity to known proteins were chosen for the next round of analysis. We iden￾tified approximately 2,500 clones after the first round of selection. Sec￾ond, these 2,500 clones were examined for the presence of putative signal 
sequences using SignalP-2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-2.0/) and 
SOSUIsignal Beta Version (http://sosui.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/cgi-bin/
sosui.cgi?/sosuisignal/sosuisignal_submit.html). We identified approxi￾mately 140 clones with putative signal peptides. Third, these 140 clones 
were further evaluated for the presence of transmembrane domains using 
SOSUIsignal Beta Version. Those containing transmembrane domains 
were excluded for further study. Thus, 114 clones remained and were then 
subjected to domain search using Protein Families Database of Alignments 
(Pfam) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). The cDNA clones 
of interest were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC), sequenced on both strands (Yale University, Keck Foundation 
Biotechnology Resource Laboratory), and analyzed using BLAST.
Northern blot analysis. Studies were carried out with the entire coding 
region of the clones of interest as previously described (22).
Construction of gene expression cassettes. We used TAP to engineer a 5′-cyto￾megalovirus promoter and 3′–simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal site 
in each candidate clone (11). The following PCR primers were used to 
generate renalase TAP fragments: 5′-oligo, 5′-CTGCAGGCACCGTCGTC￾GACTTAACAatgcgaccccagggccccgccg (upper case represents the 5′-TAP 
universal sequence, which is used as an anchor for second-step PCR; lower 
case represents the renalase-specific sequence starting at the ATG initia￾tion site); 3′-oligo, 5′-CATCAATGTATCTTATCATGTCTGATCAACCAGC￾TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTttttggtagttcttcaataag (the first 25 
bases comprise 3′-TAP universal sequence, which is used as an anchor for 
second-step PCR; the underlined sequence encodes HA followed by a stop 
codon, TGA; lower case represents the renalase-specific sequence starting 
at 3′ end minus the stop codon). The 5′ and 3′ primers used for the second￾step PCR were provided by the manufacturer (Gene Therapy Systems Inc.).
Gene delivery and expression. In vitro transfection was carried out using 
GenePORTER (Gene Therapy Systems Inc.) following the procedures 
recommended by the manufacturer. We consistently obtained 40–60% 
transfection efficiency as assessed using a GFP TAP fragment as control.
In situ hybridization. Studies were performed as described previously (23). 
In brief, a 426-bp HindIII and PstI renalase fragment was cloned into the 
pBluescript II KS(+) vector. The vector was used to synthesize digoxigenin 
(DIG)-labeled RNA probes with DIG-labeling kit (Roche Biochemicals). 
The antisense was used to detect renalase gene expression, while the sense 
strand was used as control.
Generation of glutathione synthase–renalase recombinant protein. The renalase 
coding region (nt 22–1047) was amplified by PCR (sense primer, 5′-TTTT￾GGATCCATGGCGCAGGTGCTGATCGTG and antisense, 3′-TTTT￾GAATTCCTAAATATAATTCTTTAAAGC). The PCR product was digested 
with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (Promega) 
in frame with a glutathione synthase (GST) tag (26 kDa) at the N-termi￾nus. The clones were verified by DNA sequencing and used to transform 
E. coli BL21. Transformed bacteria were grown at 37°C for 16 hours in the 
presence of 0.1 μM FAD. Isopropyl-BD-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM) 
was added for the last 3.5 hours of culture. The renalase fusion protein 
was purified using Glutathione Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). When 
FAD was omitted during protein synthesis, the resulting synthetic renalase 
was devoid of oxidase activity (data not shown).
Antibody preparation. Anti-renalase polyclonal sera were generated by Pro￾teintech Group Inc., with recombinant GST-renalase fusion protein used 
as the antigen. The sera were purified by affinity chromatography using a 
column containing full-length renalase.
Western blot analysis. Studies were carried out as previously described 
using either anti-HA or anti-renalase antibodies (23).
Immunolocalization. Protein expression in human kidney and heart was exam￾ined using the anti-renalase polyclonal sera as previously described (23).
Amine oxidase assay. We assessed the ability of renalase to oxidize biogenic 
amines using an Amplex Red Monoamine Oxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen 
Corp.). The assay is based on the detection of H2O2 in a HRP-coupled reac￾tion using 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxy-phenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent; 
Invitrogen Corp.). The Amplex Red reagent reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoi￾chiometry, and the resulting fluorescence signal is directly proportional to 
H2O2 production and hence amine oxidase enzymatic activity. Experiments 
were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a final 
substrate concentration of 2 mM.
Human subjects. Plasma samples were obtained from 4 healthy individuals 
and 8 patients with ESRD. Among the ESRD patients, renal failure was due 
to chronic diabetic nephropathy (n = 3), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (n = 3), 
interstitial nephritis (n = 1), and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease (n = 1). Patients had been receiving hemodialysis treatment 3 times 
a week for at least 1 year. Blood samples were obtained prior to a routine 
dialysis treatment. None of the patients were receiving α or β blockers, 
clonidine, methyldopa, or MAO-A or MAO-B inhibitors, and none had a 
history of psychiatric disorders. The protocol was approved by the Human 
Investigative Committee of the Veteran Administration Connecticut 
Health Care System, and all participants gave written, informed consent.
Human renalase purification. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final 
concentration of 40% to 2 l urine samples collected from healthy volun￾teers. Following an overnight incubation at 4°C, the pellet was collected 
by centrifugation (10,000 g for 30 minutes), resuspended in cold PBS buf￾fer containing protease inhibitors, and dialyzed overnight at 4°C. Renalase 
was purified using an agarose–anti-renalase affinity column. The purified 
protein was eluted by Immunopure IgG elution (Pierce), analyzed by SDS￾PAGE, and used in in vitro amine oxidase assays.
Hemodynamics measurements. Sprague-Dawley rats (150–250 g each) were 
anesthetized with inactin (100 mg/kg). A polyethylene catheter (PE-240) 
was placed in the trachea for airway protection and in the left jugular 
vein (PE-50) for i.v. infusion of a maintenance fluid solution consisting 
of normal saline with 6.25% BSA at a rate of 1.5 ml/100 g body wt per 
hour. Core temperature was monitored through a rectal thermometer, and 
a heating pad was used to maintain body temperature at 37°C. Arterial 
pressure and pulse were continuously monitored through a PE-50 catheter 
inserted in the left carotid artery and connected to a pressure transducer 
(ADInstruments). Hemodynamic recordings were digitized, stored, and 
analyzed using a PowerLab/8SP data acquisition system (ADIntruments). 
The rats were allowed 1 hour to recover after the surgical procedure was 
completed, and the subsequent 30 minutes served as a control period. The 
experimental group then received a bolus injection of 0.5 mg of recombi-

nant renalase in 0.5 ml PBS. The control group was injected with either 0.5 
mg BSA or 0.5 mg recombinant glutathione transferase in 0.5 ml of PBS. 
Blood pressure and pulse were continuously measured and recorded. To 
study renalase effect on cardiac function, we inserted a pressure/volume 
(P-V) combination catheter (Millar Mikro-Tip P-V catheter, model SPR-838; 
Millar Instruments) into the right common carotid artery and advanced it 
into the left ventricle in order to measure intraventricular pressures and 
volumes during the cardiac cycle. P-V loops were monitored continuously 
before and during infusion of renalase and recorded using a PowerLab data 
acquisition system (model 8SP; ADInstruments). Ventricular pressure and 
ventricular volume were measured, and heart rate, mean arterial pressure, 
cardiac output, dP/dt (cardiac contractility), arterial elastance, and system￾ic vascular resistance were calculated.
Statistical analysis. Standard paired Student’s t tests were used for compar￾isons between two groups. Standard unpaired Student’s t tests were used 
for group comparisons at equivalent periods. All data are mean values ± SE, 
and P < 0.05 was accepted as a statistically significant difference.
