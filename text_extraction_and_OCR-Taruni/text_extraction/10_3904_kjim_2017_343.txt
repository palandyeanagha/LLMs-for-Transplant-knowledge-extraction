INTRODUCTION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most 
common chronic liver disease worldwide and is esti￾mated to affect one-third of the general population [1,2]. 
It includes a spectrum of diseases ranging from non-al￾coholic fatty liver (NAFL), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), advanced fibrosis, and end-stage liver disease to 
hepatocellular carcinoma [3]. The increasing prevalence 
of obesity and diabetes parallels the increasing preva￾lence and severity of NAFLD, and as the population ages, 
a considerable number of patients with NAFLD will de￾velop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In addition, 
NAFLD is closely associated with cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, which eventually 
lead to increased cardiovascular mortality [4]. There is 
consistent evidence supporting common pathophysi￾ologic mechanisms between metabolic syndrome and 
NAFLD, which usually involve visceral obesity and in￾sulin resistance [5-7]. However, there are currently no 
approved pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD. There￾fore, similar to the recommended treatment for meta￾bolic syndrome, the treatment for NAFLD has focused 
on lifestyle modifications including weight loss, dietary 
changes, and increased physical activity [8]. In this re￾view, we summarize the lifestyle modifications recom￾mended for patients with NAFLD, focusing on the im￾pact of physical activity.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver dis￾ease, and the prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis is 
increasing as the population with NAFLD ages. To date, lifestyle modifications 
including weight loss, increased physical activity, and dietary changes remain 
the treatment of choice for NAFLD because there are no approved effective phar￾macologic agents. Increased physical activity has therapeutic effects on NAFLD 
by reducing hepatic fat independent of weight reduction. Indeed, even minimal 
physical activity below the recommended threshold may have a beneficial impact 
on NAFLD. Aerobic activity and resistance training have similar effects on NA￾FLD. Universal recommendations for the optimal intensity and dose of physical 
activity have not been established. Therefore, physical activity should be tailored 
based on a patient’s clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and fitness capacity. 
Physical activity also prevents the development of NAFLD and may represent a 
valuable strategy for reducing the public health burden. However, there are in￾sufficient data supporting the effects of physical activity on the progression of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver to NASH with advanced fibrosis, and on extrahepatic dis￾ease-related morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we review the role of physical 
activity in the management of NAFLD.

DIAGNOSIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NAFLD
NAFLD is defined as hepatic fat accumulation (≥ 5% of 
the liver) determined either by imaging or histology af￾ter excluding other causes of hepatic steatosis such as 
viral hepatitis, significant alcohol consumption, use of 
steatogenic medication, or hereditary disorders [9]. NA￾FLD includes NAFL, which is defined as hepatic steato￾sis without hepatocellular injury, and NASH, which is 
defined as hepatic steatosis with hepatocyte balloon de￾generation and/or hepatic lobular inflammation [10,11]. 
The worldwide prevalence of NAFLD is reportedly 20% 
to 30% in the general population, and its incidence is 
approximately 20 to 30 per 1,000 person-years depend￾ing on their characteristics [11]. In Korea, the prevalence 
of ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD is approximate￾ly 16% to 33%, which is increasing in parallel with the 
increasing prevalence of obesity [10,12]. A recent me￾ta-analysis estimated the prevalence of NASH to be 1.5% 
to 6.5% in the general population, but data are scarce 
[13]. A recent Markov model for forecasting NAFLD 
progression indicated that NASH- and NAFLD-related 
end-stage liver disease and mortality will exponentially 
increase in the United States due to the increasing prev￾alence of obesity and diabetes and the ageing popula￾tion [14]. Old age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and 
metabolic syndrome are known risk factors for NAFLD 
and are closely associated with NASH with advanced fi￾brosis [9,10,15]. The increasing prevalence of NASH with 
advanced fibrosis is concerning due to the associated 
liver-related and cardiovascular disease-related mor￾bidity and mortality [16]. NASH is also associated with 
an increased risk for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Overall, 10% to 29% of patients with NASH 
progress to liver cirrhosis within 10 years, and 4% to 
27% of these patients have hepatocellular carcinoma [17]. 
Two imaging methods, magnetic resonance elastogra￾phy [18,19] and transient elastography [20,21], are useful 
for diagnosing advanced fibrosis and may be useful for 
detecting NASH with or without advanced fibrosis. In 
the clinical setting, several non-invasive serum algo￾rithms for diagnosing advanced fibrosis in patients with 
NAFLD have been developed in the past several years. Of 
these various algorithms, the FIB-4 (fibrosis-4) and NA￾FLD fibrosis scores are the most widely validated, and 
have superior test characteristics [22-24].
NAFLD AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 
There is accumulating evidence that NAFLD is related to 
non-liver systemic complications such as cardiovascular 
disease [25-27], diabetes [28], and metabolic syndrome 
[29,30], which eventually leads to increased cardiovascu￾lar mortality [4,31]. The most plausible pathophysiologic 
factors underlying the relationship between NAFLD and 
systemic extrahepatic complications are insulin resis￾tance and visceral obesity [5,32]. It is difficult to verify the 
causal relationships among visceral obesity, insulin re￾sistance, and NAFLD because of the associations among 
these factors. However, an expanded and inflamed vis￾ceral fat mass releases various proinflammatory mol￾ecules that are associated with insulin resistance and 
atherosclerosis [7,33,34]. Insulin resistance and excessive 
triglycerides, particularly those from visceral fat, are 
pathogenic factors in the development and progression 
of NAFLD [7,33,34]. All of these factors are responsible for 
chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity, 
which can lead to a hypercoagulated state, atherogen￾ic dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia; in turn, these factors 
provoke systemic extrahepatic complications of NAFLD 
such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [34,35].
RECOMMENDED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS 
FOR TREATING NAFLD (WEIGHT LOSS AND 
DIETARY CHANGES)
To date, there are no approved, effective pharmacolog￾ical treatments for NAFLD. Therefore, treatments have 
focused on lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, 
dietary control, and increased physical activity [9,36], 
similar to the recommendations for metabolic syn￾drome [4,8]. The treatment strategy for individual com￾ponents of metabolic syndrome may also be applied for 
NAFLD, with a focus on the control of blood glucose, 
blood pressure, triglycerides, and high density lipopro￾tein cholesterol. Current practice guidelines for meta￾bolic syndrome from the American Heart Association/
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Scientific 
Statement recommend reducing body weight by 7% to 
10% from baseline [8]. The guidelines for dietary chang￾es recommend reducing the intake of saturated fat to < 
7% of total calories, reducing trans-fat intake, and main-

The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2018
taining dietary cholesterol intake at < 200 mg/day and 
total fat at 25% to 35% of total calories [8]. Observational 
studies have shown that increasing physical activity is 
beneficial, and that there is a dose-response relationship 
between physical activity and metabolic syndrome [37]. 
Engaging in regular moderate-intensity physical activ￾ity for at least 30 minutes for more than 5 days/week is 
recommended for the treatment of metabolic syndrome 
[8,38,39]. 
For patients with NAFLD, lifestyle modifications 
including weight loss, total calorie restriction, and 
increased physical activity are also recommended, 
consistent with the recommendations for metabol￾ic syndrome. The characteristics of each guideline for 
weight reduction and dietary restrictions for the treat￾ment of NAFLD are summarized in Table 1. Weight 
loss with lifestyle modification is the most important 
goal for improving NAFLD. The American Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) NAFLD prac￾tice guidelines recommend body-weight reduction of at 
least 3% to 5% to improve hepatic steatosis, and greater 
body-weight reduction (≥ 7%) to improve the histologic 
features of NASH including fibrosis [11]. A prospective 
study of the histology of paired liver samples showed 
that weight loss improved both NASH-related factors 
and fibrosis. In addition, a dose-response relationship 
was evident between weight loss and histologic NASH 
parameters [40]. Guidelines from the European Associ￾ation for the Study of the Liver-European Association 
for the Study of Diabetes-European Association for the 
Study of Obesity (EASL-EASD-EASO) and Korean Asso￾ciation for the Study of the Liver (KASL) [10] similarly 
recommend a weight reduction of 7% to 10% for the im￾provement of NAFLD. 
Regarding diet, the EASL-EASD-EASO and AASLD 
guidelines recommend calorie restriction by 500 to 
1,000 kcal to induce weight loss of 0.5 to 1.0 kg/week with 
a target total body weight reduction of 7% to 10%. The 
KASL guidelines recommend energy reduction of 400 to 
500 kcal, which is slightly lower than that in the other 
two guidelines. Concerning macronutrient composi￾tion, the EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines recommend a 
low-to-moderate fat intake and a moderate-to-high car￾bohydrate intake or low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets or 
high-protein diets [36]; however, the AASLD guidelines 
do not recommend a specific macronutrient composi￾tion, as it appears to be less relevant than the end result 
of sustained weight loss [11]. Both the AASLD and EA￾SL-EASD-EASO guidelines report the beneficial effects 
of the Mediterranean diet. The KASL guidelines suggest 
a low carbohydrate diet, considering the higher daily car￾bohydrate intake in Korea compared to other areas [10].

RECOMMENDATIONS ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
FOR TREATING NAFLD 
Regarding physical activity as a lifestyle modification, in￾creasing physical activity reduces intrahepatic triglycer￾ide content and markers of hepatocellular injury in pa￾tients with NAFLD independent of weight loss (Table 2) 
[41-45]. Specifically, 150 to 200 min/week of moderate-in￾tensity aerobic physical activity in three to five sessions 
are recommended by the EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines 
[36]. The KASL practice guidelines recommend at least 
30 minutes of physical activity more than twice per week 
to reduce hepatic fat [10]. The AASLD guidelines suggest 
the beneficial effects of physical activity, but do not state 
a specific cut-off for physical activity. In this review, we 
focus on the relationship between physical activity as a 
lifestyle modification and NAFLD.
THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
ON IMPROVEMENTS IN NAFLD 
Definition of terms 
Physical activity is defined as body movement produced 
by skeletal muscles, which results in energy expenditure 
beyond that at rest [46]. Exercise is a subset of physical 
activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive, with 
the goal of improving or maintaining physical fitness 
[46]. Whereas most previous studies have utilized phys￾ical activity mixed with exercise, we only used ‘physical 
activity’ with a broader meaning in our review. The rela￾tionship between dose and intensity of physical activity 
is important when defining the amount of physical ac￾tivity. In this review, we defined the term ‘dose’ as the to￾tal amount of energy expended in physical activity [46]. 
The frequency of physical activity has been considered 
the dose of physical activity in several studies, although 
the frequency does not precisely reflect the dose. The 
intensity of physical activity refers to the rate of ener￾gy expenditure during such activity [46,47], and can be 
defined in either absolute or relative terms. Absolute 
intensity reflects the rate of energy expenditure during 
physical activity and is usually expressed in metabolic 
equivalents (METs). One MET is a resting metabolic rate 
of approximately 3.5 mL O2
/kg/min. The relative intensi￾ty refers to the percentage aerobic power utilized during 
physical activity and is expressed as the percentage of 
maximal heart rate or of the maximal aerobic capacity 
(VO2
 max). Moderate-intensity physical activity is de￾fined in terms of relative intensity as 40% to 60% of VO2 
max, and in terms of absolute intensity as 4 to 6 METs. 
Vigorous-intensity physical activity is defined as relative 
intensity more than 60% of the VO2 max or absolute in￾tensity > 6 METs [48]. In the widely used Internation￾al Physical Activity Questionnaire, moderate-intensity 
activity was defined as 4 METs, and vigorous-intensity 
activity was considered 8 METs [49]. 
Table 2. Physical activity guidelines
Study Physical activity
AASLD [11] Moderate-intensity exercise is good for hepatic steatosis, but the effects on other aspects of liver 
histology are not known. 
The optimal duration and intensity of exercise remain undetermined. 
The effects on underlying NASH or fibrosis are less clear. 
EASL-EASD-EASO [36] Moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity in 3–5 sessions for a total of 150–200 min/week is 
generally preferred. 
Resistance training is also effective.
Physical activity has a dose-response relationship, and vigorous rather than moderate exercise car￾ries the full benefit for NASH and fibrosis. 
KASL [10] Exercise more than twice per week and for more than 30 minutes is beneficial for reducing hepatic 
steatosis.

Aerobic versus resistance physical activity
One practical issue regarding physical activity is deter￾mining which type of physical activity (aerobic vs. re￾sistance) has greater beneficial effects on NAFLD. Both 
now and in the past, aerobic physical activity is highly 
recommended to improve markers of hepatic injury 
such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine ami￾notransferase levels, and histologic features of NAFLD 
such as the NAFLD activity score [42,50-52]. In two recent 
randomized trials that compared the impact of aerobic 
activity and resistance training on NAFLD, there were 
no significant differences between these two types of 
physical activity regarding improvements in hepatic in￾jury or intrahepatic triglycerides [53,54], despite a previ￾ous report [55] stating that aerobic physical activity leads 
to a greater reduction in hepatic fat level. Hallsworth et 
al. [56] first reported that resistance training specifically 
improves NAFLD independent of body weight change 
compared to standard treatment. Eight weeks of resis￾tance training elicited a 13% relative reduction in the in￾trahepatic triglyceride level (p < 0.05) [56]. Bacchi et al. [53] 
performed a randomized clinical trial comparing aero￾bic training and resistance training to reduce intrahe￾patic triglyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
and reported a similar reduction in both groups. NAFLD 
similarly regressed in about one-quarter of the patients 
in both of the physical activity groups (23.1% vs. 23.5%, p
= 0.99) [53]. A recent systematic review comparing aero￾bic activity and resistance training showed similar im￾provements in NAFLD between resistance and aerobic 
physical activity [42,50]. Aerobic activity and resistance 
training seem to have different mechanisms for improv￾ing NAFLD. Aerobic physical activity improves NAFLD 
by activating lipolysis in various tissues, upregulating 
uncoupling protein-1 and peroxisome proliferator-acti￾vated receptor γ pathways, and altering adipokine levels 
[50]. Resistance training may improve NAFLD by evok￾ing hypertrophy of type II muscle fibers, altering myok￾ine levels, and activating glucose transporter 4, AMP-ac￾tivated protein kinase, and caveolins [50]. A recent study 
showed that resistance training improved NAFLD with 
less energy consumption [50]. Close associations be￾tween sarcopenia and NASH and advanced fibrosis in 
NAFLD also suggest that resistance training may have 
effects on NASH and advanced fibrosis in patients with 
NAFLD and sarcopenia [57]. Thus, patients with NAFLD 
can perform their preferred physical activity, aerobic 
activity or resistance training, and resistance training 
could be recommended for those with poor cardio-re￾spiratory fitness or sarcopenia, or those who cannot tol￾erate aerobic physical activity [50]. 
Minimum dose of physical activity for NAFLD
The beneficial effects of minimal levels of physical ac￾tivity on NAFLD are unclear. Randomized clinical trials 
have usually applied the recommended dose of physi￾cal activity in the intervention arm; thus, it is difficult 
to determine the impact of minimum levels of physical 
activity, below that recommended, on NAFLD based on 
current evidence. A recent randomized trial evaluated 
the effects of 8 weeks of different doses and intensities 
of aerobic physical activity on liver fat levels using the 
following groups: group 1 (low-to-moderate intensity, 
high dose: 50% VO2peak, 60 minutes, 4 days/week), group 
2 (high intensity, low dose: 70% VO2peak, 45 minutes, 3 
days/week), group 3 (low-to-moderate intensity, low 
dose: 50% VO2peak, 45 minutes, 3 days/week), and group 
4 (placebo). In this study, all of the groups, even group 
3 with the lowest physical activity dose and intensity, 
showed a reduction in liver fat and visceral fat without 
significant weight loss [58]. A Korean cross-sectional 
study showed that an increased sitting time (sedentary 
lifestyle) was associated with a high prevalence ratio of 
NAFLD (prevalence ratio: 1.04 for 5 to 9 hours/day and 
1.09 for ≥ 10 hours/day compared to < 5 hours/day of sit￾ting time) [59]. The risk for NAFLD decreased by 6% in 
the minimally active groups compared to the inactive 
group [59]. Given the paucity of evidence, these results 
suggest that even minimal engagement in physical ac￾tivity might provide a slight benefit to NAFLD patients. 
It may be worth recommending that NAFLD patients 
who are reluctant to engage in physical activity “just be 
active,” irrespective of weight change or the amount of 
physical activity. 
Dose-response relationship between physical activ￾ity and NAFLD
While minimal physical activity and the avoidance of 
sedentary behavior may be slightly beneficial for NA￾FLD as described above, several studies have suggested 
a dose-response relationship between physical activi￾ty and improvements in NAFLD. Recently, we report-

69
Kwak MS and Kim D. NAFLD and physical activity 
https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2017.343 www.kjim.org
ed a dose-dependent inverse association between the 
dose of physical activity and prevalence of NAFLD, in￾dependent of visceral adipose tissue area and insulin 
resistance ([fourth quartile (highest physical activity): 
odds ratio (OR), 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54 
to 0.85]; [third quartile: OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.93] vs. 
first quartile [lowest physical activity]; p for trend < 0.001) 
[60]. Another Korean cross-sectional study also reported 
a dose-response relationship between physical activity 
and NAFLD. The prevalence ratios for NAFLD between 
minimally active and health-enhancing physically active 
groups and the inactive group were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92 
to 0.95) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82), respectively (p for 
trend < 0.001) [59]. The lower cut-off for recommended 
physical activity according to the Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS) and the US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) for adults is ≥ 150 min/week of 
moderate activity or ≥ 75 min/week of vigorous activity, 
which is approximately 500 MET-min/week [51]. Subjects 
who satisfied the minimum recommended physical ac￾tivity (≥ 500 MET-min/week) had a 34% decreased risk 
for NAFLD compared to inactive subjects, which implies 
that the typical recommended dose of regular physical 
activity (approximately ≥ 500 MET-min/week) is ben￾eficial [60]. A recent retrospective longitudinal study 
showed that subjects with more than 250 min/week of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity had significantly 
attenuated levels of hepatic steatosis (–31.8% vs. –23.2%) 
compared to those with fewer than 250 min/week of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity independent of 
detectable weight reduction [43]. All of these data support 
a dose-response relationship between NAFLD and phys￾ical activity. 
An optimal physical activity protocol for NAFLD 
Although a dose of physical activity below the current 
recommendations may have slight beneficial effects 
on NAFLD, accumulating evidence suggests an inverse 
dose-response relationship between physical activity 
and NAFLD. However, the optimal protocol in terms 
of type, intensity, and dose of physical activity for the 
treatment of NAFLD has not been established. Because 
current evidence on the intensity and dose of physical 
activity was obtained from diverse and heterogeneous 
populations regarding age, sex, ethnicity, and medical 
comorbidities, it is difficult to make a conclusive recom￾mendation for everyone. Therefore, the optimal train￾ing protocol in terms of type (aerobic vs. resistance), in￾tensity, and dose should be tailored based on a patient’s 
clinical characteristics, comorbidities, fitness status, and 
preferences [36].
Effects of physical activity on NASH or advanced 
fibrosis
Most studies have focused on the effects of physical ac￾tivity on NAFL because of the difficulty in diagnosing 
NASH and advanced fibrosis without performing an 
invasive liver biopsy. However, because NASH with ad￾vanced fibrosis is closely associated with an increased 
risk for liver-related and non-liver-related mortality [16], 
the effects of physical activity on NASH or advanced fi￾brosis are important for reducing the public health risk. 
A cross-sectional study by the NASH Clinical Research 
Network showed that subjects who met the vigorous 
physical activity recommendations of the DHHS and 
USDA (≥ 6 MET, minimum target of 75 min/week), but 
not those who met the moderate physical activity rec￾ommendations (3 to 5.9 MET, minimum target of 150 
min/week), were less likely to have NASH (OR, 0.65; 95% 
CI, 0.43 to 0.98). Doubling the recommended time spent 
in vigorous physical activity, which is suggested for 
achieving additional health benefits, is associated with 
a decreased adjusted OR for advanced fibrosis (OR, 0.53; 
95% CI, 0.29 to 0.97) [51]. A small pilot study compar￾ing the effects of physical activity versus diet showed no 
significant reduction in NAFLD activity score or fibro￾sis or in NASH resolution rate in the physical activity 
intervention arm (6 months of circuit physical activity 
training in nine patients with NAFLD) compared to the 
dietary intervention arm [61]. The effects of physical ac￾tivity per se on histologic changes could not be evaluated 
due to the lack of a control group [61]. A recent random￾ized controlled trial including 24 biopsy-proven NASH 
patients showed that 12 weeks of cycling and resistance 
training without weight loss reduced intrahepatic tri￾glyceride content and plasma triglycerides. However, 
there were no effects on metabolic parameters, circu￾lating levels of markers of inflammation (interleukin 
6, tumor necrosis factor α, and C-reactive protein), and 
levels of non-invasive markers of fibrosis [52]. One study 
of 59 NASH subjects (NASH was diagnosed by histology 
in fewer than 30 subjects) showed significantly greater

The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2018
normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase levels 
in patients in the moderate-intensity aerobic physical 
activity intervention arm compared to those without an 
exercise program [62]. Current and previous randomized 
trials and longitudinal studies have been too small or of 
inadequate duration to draw a conclusion regarding the 
effects of physical activity on NASH and advanced fibro￾sis. To more accurately determine the effects of physical 
activity on NASH and advanced fibrosis, larger and lon￾ger-term studies are warranted. Until further evidence 
regarding the effects of physical activity on NASH and 
advanced fibrosis is obtained, lifestyle modifications in￾cluding weight loss, dietary changes, and physical activi￾ty should be recommended for patients with NASH and 
advanced fibrosis who are considering pharmacologic 
treatment [63]. 
Therapeutic effects of physical activity on extrahe￾patic manifestations of NAFLD
The primary outcome of most studies regarding the 
effects of physical activity on NAFLD was an improve￾ment in hepatic steatosis or levels of surrogate markers 
of hepatic injury, inflammation, or fibrosis. Although 
liver-related mortality is increased in patients with NA￾FLD, particularly in those with NASH or advanced fi￾brosis, the overall mortality of NAFLD patients is mainly 
due to cardiovascular disease [4]. Accumulating evidence 
from general population-based studies shows that phys￾ical activity reduces cardiovascular disease mortality in 
the general population [46,64,65]. Physical activity ca￾pacity also predicted cardiovascular disease mortality 
in a clinically healthy population [66,67]. A meta-analy￾sis showed that an improvement in VO2
 max of 1 MET 
reduced all-cause mortality by 13% and cardiovascular 
events by 15% among healthy participants [63,68]. Phys￾ical activity also had beneficial effects on established 
cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance, 
elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, elevated 
triglycerides, obesity, and low high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels, which are also closely associated with 
NAFLD [46,69-72]. In fact, a randomized controlled trial 
of subjects with biopsy-proven NASH found decreased 
plasma triglyceride levels in the physical activity arm 
compared to the control arm [52]. To sum up these re￾sults, physical activity may play roles in the improve￾ment of both NAFLD and extrahepatic manifestations, 
such as metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular-re￾lated morbidity. 
THE PREVENTIVE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL AC￾TIVITY ON NAFLD DEVELOPMENT AND PRO￾GRESSION 
Currently, in the absence of approved, effective pharma￾cologic treatments for NAFLD, which is a highly prev￾alent and emerging health burden, treatments focused 
on lifestyle modifications and prevention strategies are 
crucial for reducing the future public health burden. In 
our longitudinal cohort study, which included 1,373 sub￾jects without NAFLD at baseline, 288 (21.0%) developed 
NAFLD during a median 4.4-year follow-up period. A 
higher dose of physical activity at baseline was associated 
with a decrease in subsequent NAFLD development [73]. 
Compared to subjects with the lowest dose of physical 
activity, those who reported the highest dose of physical 
activity had a 34% decreased risk for developing NAFLD, 
even after adjustment for visceral obesity and insulin re￾sistance [73]. Furthermore, there was a dose-response re￾lationship between the level of physical activity (evaluat￾ed as MET-min/week) and incident NAFLD (p for trend 
= 0.025). A recent Korean study reported similar results 
during a 5-year follow-up, although physical activity was 
only measured as frequency per week [74]. A Japanese 
prospective cohort study showed that only vigorous-in￾tensity physical activity (≥ 7 METs), not moderate-to-low 
(3 to 5 METs) or moderate‑to-high (5 to 7 METs) intensity 
physical activity, prevented the progression of NAFL to 
NASH, which is defined as NAFLD with elevated liver 
enzyme levels [75]. In a recent study in Taiwan, physi￾cal activity > 150 min/week was significantly protective 
against cirrhosis in obese patients, although patients 
with NAFLD or other chronic liver diseases were includ￾ed in the study [76].
In daily life, patients are left with the challenge of 
physical activity, which is difficult to implement or 
maintain in a predictable fashion. We evaluated whether 
changes in the physical activity dose during the median 
4.4-year follow-up affected new development of NAFLD 
in subjects without NAFLD at baseline [73]. As expected, 
subjects with reduced physical activity during follow-up 
had a 59% increased risk for incident NAFLD compared

to subjects with sustained or increased physical activity 
(hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.27; p = 0.011). This re￾sult suggests that sustained physical activity is import￾ant for the prevention of NAFLD. 
CONCLUSIONS
Increasing physical activity has beneficial effects on NA￾FLD by improving hepatic injury, hepatic fat, and his￾tologic features of NAFLD, independent of weight loss. 
Even a level of physical activity below that recommend￾ed or the avoidance of a sedentary lifestyle may have a 
beneficial impact on NAFLD, emphasizing the impor￾tance of “just being active.” Aerobic physical activity and 
resistance training showed similar improvements in 
NAFLD. While there is a dose-response relationship be￾tween physical activity and NAFLD and sustained phys￾ical activity has beneficial effects on NAFLD, universal 
recommendations on the optimal intensity and dose of 
physical activity have not been established. Therefore, 
physical activity should be tailored based on a patient’s 
clinical characteristics, medical comorbidities, and 
physical fitness capacity. The beneficial effects of physi￾cal activity on NAFLD development could be applied to 
prevent incident NAFLD and reduce the future public 
health burden. However, evidence regarding the effects 
of physical activity on NASH with advanced fibrosis and 
on non-liver disease-related morbidity and mortality is 
insufficient and must be augmented and verified in fu￾ture studies.
