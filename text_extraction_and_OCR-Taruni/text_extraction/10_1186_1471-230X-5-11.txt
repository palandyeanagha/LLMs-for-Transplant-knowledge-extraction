Abstract
Background: In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) fatigue is
a major clinical problem. Abnormal amino acid (AA) patterns have been implicated in the
development of fatigue in several non-hepatological conditions but for PBC and PSC no data are
available. This study aimed to identify abnormalities in AA patterns and to define their relation with
fatigue.
Methods: Plasma concentrations of tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, valine, leucine and
isoleucine were determined in plasma of patients with PBC (n = 45), PSC (n = 27), chronic hepatitis
C (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 73). Fatigue and quality of life were quantified using the Fisk
fatigue severity scale, a visual analogue scale and the SF-36.
Results: Valine, isoleucine, leucine were significantly decreased in PBC and PSC. Tyrosine and
phenylalanine were increased (p < 0.0002) and tryptophan decreased (p < 0.0001) in PBC. In PBC,
but not in PSC, a significant inverse relation between tyrosine concentrations and fatigue and
quality of life was found. Patients without fatigue and with good quality of life had increased tyrosine
concentrations compared to fatigued patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that this relation was
independent from disease activity or severity or presence of cirrhosis.
Conclusion: In patients with PBC and PSC, marked abnormalities in plasma AA patterns occur.
Normal tyrosine concentrations, compared to increased concentrations, may be associated with
fatigue and diminished quality of life.
Background
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC) are chronic cholestatic liver diseases
characterized by a usually slowly progressive course [1,2].
Many patients remain in good clinical condition for many
years but may suffer from fatigue interfering with normal
activities and general quality of life during a significant
part of their life [3-5]. Fatigue is not related to the severity
or activity of the liver disease, and its pathophysiology
remains unknown [3,4,6]. In several non-hepatological
conditions amino acids, in particular tryptophan and
tyrosine, have been reported to be involved in the

pathophysiology of fatigue [7,8]. Plasma amino acid
abnormalities have been studied extensively in patients
with liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy [9]. In
patients with less advanced liver disease of various etiolo￾gies, significant differences with respect to plasma amino
acid concentrations and tyrosine metabolism have been
reported in comparison with control individuals. These
studies were performed more than two decades ago, at a
time when fatigue had not been identified as a significant
problem in cholestatic liver disease. Thus far, the potential
role of abnormalities in amino acid metabolism in fatigue
associated with cholestatic liver disease has not been eval￾uated and relevant data in PSC are completely lacking.
The present study aimed to identify abnormalities in
plasma concentrations of several amino acids and their
relation to fatigue and quality of life in patients with PBC
and PSC.
Methods
The study was approved by our institution's medical eth￾ics committee and informed consent was obtained from
each patient. Patients with a diagnosis of PBC (45) or PSC
(27) visiting the hepatology outpatient clinic of the Eras￾mus Medical Center between October 2001 and June
2002 were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria were
an age of less than 18 years and incomplete understanding
of the Dutch language. As controls with respect to amino
acid concentrations, a group of 22 patients with untreated
chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and a group of
73 healthy individuals were included. Fatigue in patients
with PBC and PSC was quantified using a visual analogue
scale (VAS) and the Fisk fatigue severity scale (FFSS). The
FFSS has been validated for use in PBC, and quantifies
fatigue in a physical, social and cognitive domain [6,10].
Quality of life was quantified using the SF-36, a widely
used quality of life questionnaire [11]. These question￾naires were also obtained from a separate group of 18 age
and sex-matched controls, because no questionnaires
could be obtained from the previous group of 73 healthy
individuals in whom amino acid concentrations were
determined. Total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, pro￾thrombin time and serum activities of alkaline phos￾phatase (AP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were
obtained as markers of disease activity and severity. The
presence of cirrhosis was determined on the basis of his￾tological and, if not available, clinical criteria (ultrasound
findings compatible with cirrhosis if supported by the
presence of thrombocytopenia or esophageal varices).
Amino acid measurement
Immediately after the venapuncture plasma was prepared
by a 20 min centrifugation step at 2650 g and stored at -
80°C. The amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryp￾tophan, isoleucine, leucine and valine were measured by
means of high-performance liquid chromatography as
described elsewhere [12]. The tryptophan ratio, which is
the ratio of tryptophan to the summed concentrations of
phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, leucine and valine,
was determined as a measure for central availability of
tryptophan for serotonin synthesis. The tyrosine ratio was
determined as a measure for central availability of tyro￾sine for dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis and was
calculated as the concentration of tyrosine divided by the
sum of the concentrations of phenylalanine, tryptophan,
isoleucine, leucine and valine.
Statistics
Testing for differences between groups was performed
using Student's t-test and the χ2 test. Correlations were
tested using Pearson's correlation method. The normality
of amino acid distributions was assessed visually using
histograms, and non-parametric tests were used where
appropriate. The relations between amino acid concentra￾tions and fatigue scores were tested by calculating correla￾tion coefficients for VAS and FFSS domain scores and
plasma amino acid concentrations. In these tests, a p￾value <0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.
In order to quantify the impact of the differences in amino
acid on fatigue, for those amino acids which significantly
correlated with fatigue, patients were divided into groups
with amino acid concentrations within the 95% confi￾dence interval for healthy controls and patients with con￾centrations outside this range. Testing for differences in
fatigue, quality of life and laboratory parameters between
these two groups was performed using Student's t-test.
Multivariate regression analysis including the biochemi￾cal tests of disease activity and severity and the presence of
histological or clinical cirrhosis was performed in order to
assess the independent association of amino acid abnor￾malities and fatigue. In all tests other than the correlation
tests, a two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statisti￾cally significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS (Version 9.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, U.S.A).
Results
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics for patients with PBC and PSC are
shown in table 1. As was expected because of the unbal￾anced sex distribution in these diseases, the majority of
patients with PBC were female and the majority of
patients with PSC were male. The frequency of cirrhosis,
serum bilirubin and albumin and serum activities of alka￾line phosphatase, AST and ALT did not significantly differ
for patients with PSC or PBC.
Amino acids in patients and controls

concentrations of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine and
phenylalanine were increased in patients with PBC,
whereas in HCV only tyrosine concentration was
increased compared to controls.
In PSC, neither of the aromatic amino acids was increased.
Tryptophan concentration was decreased in patients with
PBC and HCV. Plasma concentrations of the branched
chain amino acids valine, isoleucine and leucine were sig￾nificantly lower in both patients with PBC and PSC. The
tryptophan ratio was significantly decreased in patients
with PBC and HCV. The tyrosine ratio was significantly
increased in all three patient groups.
Within the group of healthy controls, no differences in
amino acid concentrations were found for different age
groups or sex.
Amino acids and markers of disease activity and severity
In patients with PBC, significant inverse correlations were
present between the branched chain amino acids valine (p
= 0.002), isoleucine (p = 0.006) and leucine (p = 0.007)
and total serum bilirubin concentrations. Plasma concen￾trations of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (p < 0.001)
and phenylalanine (p = 0.003) correlated inversely with
serum albumin concentrations. There was a significant
inverse correlation between plasma valine and the serum
activity of AST (p = 0.005). Patients with cirrhosis had
significantly increased tyrosine (p = 0.004) and

phenylalanine (p = 0.03) concentrations and an increased
tyrosine ratio (0.004) compared to non-cirrhotics.
However, all differences in amino acid concentrations
retained their significance in when only patients without
cirrhosis and with normal bilirubin and albumin were
compared to healthy controls.
In patients with PSC, no significant correlations were
found between any of the markers of disease activity or
severity and fatigue or quality of life.
Patients with PSC and inflammatory bowel disease had
significantly decreased concentrations of valine, isoleu￾cine and leucine compared to patients with PSC alone (p
= 0.02). The concentrations of tyrosine, phenylalanine
and tryptophan were not significantly different.
Amino acids, fatigue and quality of life
In patients with PBC a significant negative correlation was
found between tyrosine concentrations and all fatigue
tests. In addition, in these patients a significant negative
correlation between tryptophan concentrations and the
cognitive domain of the FFSS was found, whereas trends
towards significant correlations were found for the other
FFSS domains. For the other amino acids, no correlations
with fatigue were found (Table 3). In patients with PSC,
no significant correlations between amino acids and
fatigue were found.
Comparing PBC patients with normal tyrosine concentra￾tions with patients with increased concentrations resulted
in significant differences in VAS (p = 0.03), all domains of
the FFSS (p = 0.03, p < 0.001 and p = 0.01 for the physical,
cognitive and social domains, respectively) and the role
functioning physical (the extent to which physical health
interferes with work or other daily activities) (p = 0.001),
bodily pain (p = 0.001), general health (p = 0.03), vitality
(p = 0.004), social functioning (p = 0.005), role function￾ing emotional (the extent to which emotional problems
interfere with work or other daily activities) (p = 0.008)
and mental health (p < 0.001) domains of the SF-36 (Fig￾ures 1 and 2). In order to assess confounding by disease
severity or activity, we performed multivariate analyses for
the measurements of fatigue in PBC including plasma
tyrosine concentrations and those laboratory tests which
correlated with the amino acid, as well as the presence of
cirrhosis, although these laboratory tests and the presence
of cirrhosis themselves did not correlate with fatigue or
quality of life. These analyses showed that only the
plasma tyrosine concentration, and not the laboratory
tests or the presence of cirrhosis was significantly and
independently associated with fatigue.
Comparing patients with normal tyrosine concentrations
with healthy controls resulted in the following significant
differences: VAS (p < 0.001), the physical (p < 0.001) and
social (p = 0.004) domains of the FFSS and the physical
functioning (p < 0.001), role functioning physical (p <
0.001), bodily pain (p = 0.004), general health (p <
0.001), vitality (p < 0.001), social functioning (p = 0.001),
role emotional functioning (p = 0.05) and mental health
(p = 0.04) domains of the SF-36. There was no significant
difference in the cognitive domain of the FFSS.
Comparing patients with increased tyrosine concentra￾tions with healthy controls showed no significant differ￾ences in any of the tests except for worse scores in the
general health (p = 0.03) and better scores in the mental

health (p = 0.02) domains of the SF-36 for patients with
high tyrosine concentrations.
The mean VAS scores were 6.1 and 3.3 for patients with
normal and increased tyrosine concentrations, respec￾tively (p = 0.01). Patients with a VAS score > 5 had a mean
tyrosine concentration of 68 µMol/l, whereas patients
with a score < 5 had a mean concentration of 86 (p =
0.02).
Tests for differences in fatigue for patients with normal or
decreased tryptophan concentrations did not show signif￾icant differences between the two groups.
Discussion
The present study confirms previous findings that signifi￾cant differences in plasma amino acid concentrations
between patients with PBC and healthy controls do exist
[13,14]. We found increased concentrations of the aro￾matic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine and
decreased concentrations of tryptophan and the branched
chain amino acids valine, isoleucine and leucine. Tyrosine
concentration correlated with all measurements of
fatigue, whereas tryptophan concentrations correlated
only with the cognitive FFSS domain. PBC patients with
increased tyrosine concentrations reported less fatigue
and better quality of life compared to patients with nor￾mal concentrations. For PSC, no previous studies on
amino acid patterns are available for comparison. We
found significant decreases in the plasma concentrations
of the branched chain amino acids, and trends towards
decreased tryptophan and increased tyrosine and pheny￾lalanine concentrations. However, in contrast to PBC, no
relationship with fatigue was found. In addition, we
found that valine, isoleucine and leucine concentrations
were even lower in patients with PSC and inflammatory
bowel diseases than in patients with PSC alone. To our
knowledge, no previous data on amino acid concentra￾tions in inflammatory bowel disease are available for
comparison.
In several previous studies, mostly on hepatic encepha￾lopathy in patients with advanced cirrhosis, plasma con￾centrations of amino acids have been studied [9,15].
However, we could identify only two studies including
patients with non-cirrhotic PBC. Given the supposedly
normal liver function in these patients, these studies
somewhat surprisingly found marked differences between
patients and controls comparable to those observed in the
present study [13,14]. In addition, although the differ￾ences appeared to be somewhat smaller, comparable
results were obtained in patients with PSC. It remains
unclear which mechanisms are responsible for these dif￾ferences. Although correlations with the markers of dis￾ease severity were found, these do not adequately explain
the differences in amino acid concentrations, since only a
small proportion of the variation in amino acid concen￾trations could be explained by differences in these mark￾ers, and significant differences existed in the majority of
patients without cirrhosis and with normal albumin and
bilirubin concentrations. Therefore, we suggest other
mechanisms, rather than inflammation of the liver or an
overall decreased liver function, may be responsible for
the noted abnormalities. The nature of these mechanisms,
however, remains unknown.

Tyrosine and phenylalanine are mainly metabolized in
the liver, suggesting that decreased liver function might
result in increased plasma levels. The decreased tryp￾tophan concentrations found in our study might be
explained by increased use of tryptophan as a result of
immune activation [15,16]. We did not analyze dietary
factors that supposedly could influence amino acid con￾centrations. Previous studies found no evidence to suggest
that this is a factor of importance [13,14]. Nearly all
patients in the present study were being treated with urso￾deoxycholic acid while previous studies reporting compa￾rable plasma amino acid patterns in PBC were performed
in the pre-UDCA era [13,14]. Therefore, a role for UDCA
in causing these altered patterns seems unlikely.
Fatigue is a significant problem in many patients with
PBC and PSC, and has been studied extensively in recent
years [3,4,6,17]. However, so far, no specific etiological or
pathogenic factors have been identified. Especially, no
relation has been found with laboratory parameters for
the activity or severity of the disease or histological stage.
An effective medical treatment for fatigue associated with
PBC and PSC is not available. Two recent studies specifi￾cally addressing PBC-associated fatigue, indicate that
treatment with antioxidants is ineffective [18,19].
The present study suggests an association between fatigue
and normal tyrosine concentrations in PBC. Concentra￾tions above the 95% confidence interval for healthy con￾trols corresponded with statistically significantly less
fatigue and better quality of life scores. Although this sug￾gests that increased tyrosine concentrations may 'protect'
against fatigue and normal concentrations may 'cause'
fatigue, it may well be that that tyrosine plasma
concentration alterations are an epiphenomenon and that
both these and fatigue are caused by a so far unknown
confounding factor or mechanism. Tyrosine is a precursor
in the synthesis of dopa, dopamine, epinephrine and
norepinephrine, all of which are important neurotrans￾mitters that might play a role in fatigue. Experimental cat￾echolamine depletion has been reported to worsen
fatigue, suggesting that a (relative) lack of tyrosine might
be associated with fatigue [20,21]. Further, beneficial
effects of tyrosine administration in the prevention of
exhaustion and fatigue after physical activity in both ani￾mals and humans have been reported [22-24]. Since tyro￾sine concentrations, and not the tyrosine-ratio was
significantly associated with fatigue, a peripheral instead
of a central role for tyrosine in the development of fatigue
is suggested, which is supported by previous findings
supporting peripheral mechanisms in the development of
PBC associated fatigue [17]. In addition, other mecha￾nisms, which we did not study, such as abnormalities in
the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, for example
abnormal CRH-release, or manganese homeostasis, might
be involved in the development of fatigue in these dis￾eases [25]. In addition, cytokine release as a result of an
inflammatory response might also play a role, although
studies supporting this hypothesis are lacking. Studies
into these mechanisms might therefore be of interest.
It remains unclear why we found a relation between
fatigue and tyrosine only in patients with PBC and not in
patients with PSC. Although it is likely that fatigue would
have a similar etiology in these diseases, the cause of
fatigue remains unknown and therefore different mecha￾nisms may occur in these related diseases. Another expla￾nation might be a lack of power to detect a difference in
patients with PSC, because less patients with PSC than
with PBC were included. On the other hand, although the
relation between tyrosine and fatigue was highly signifi￾cant and occurred for all measures of fatigue, the current
finding could be the result of chance or be an epiphenom￾enon not involved in the pathogenesis of fatigue.
Further studies are therefore required to confirm the
present findings and to evaluate the effect of tyrosine sup￾pletion in PBC patients with fatigue.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we showed that in patients with PBC and
PSC, marked abnormalities in plasma amino acids occur.
In addition, in patients with PBC, normal tyrosine con￾centrations, compared to increased tyrosine concentra￾tions, may be associated with fatigue and diminished
quality of life. This association was independent from the
activity and severity of the disease.
