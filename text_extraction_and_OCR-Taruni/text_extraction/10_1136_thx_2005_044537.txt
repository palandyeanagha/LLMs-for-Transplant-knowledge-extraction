Abstract
The standard management of air leaks due to persistent
bronchopleural fistula involves chest drainage and occasionally
pleurodesis, with intractable cases requiring surgical decortication
or surgical repair. However, some of these patients may be at high
risk for surgery, particularly if they have already had thoracic
surgery or have other medical problems; for this group there is a
need for less invasive methods of stopping or reducing air leaks.
Emphasys endobronchial valves (EBV) are occlusive devices
designed primarily for endoscopic lung volume reduction in
emphysema. Because the device is a one-way inspiratory airway
blocker, it is possible that it could be used in controlling persistent
air leaks while maintaining the drainage of secretions. Two cases
are reported of persistent air leaks that were managed by
endoscopic occlusion with EBV. In one case complete stoppage of
the air leak was achieved with immediate clinical benefits. The
second patient died 5 days after treatment from additional
complications apparently not related to the procedure.
Endobronchial blockage may be a useful salvage procedure for
patients with persistent air leak for whom there is no other
treatment available.
