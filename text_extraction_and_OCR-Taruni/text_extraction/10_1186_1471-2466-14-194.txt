Abstract
Background: To evaluate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in diffuse interstitial lung diseases (DILD) patients with acute
respiratory failure (ARF) according to baseline radiological patterns and the etiology of ARF.
Methods: In a multicenter, observational, retrospective study, consecutive DILD patients undergoing NIV because of
an episode of ARF were evaluated in six Italian high dependency units. Three groups of patients were identified
based on the etiology of ARF: those with pneumonia (Group A), those with acute exacerbation of fibrosis, (Group B)
and those with other triggers (Group C). Clinical failure was defined as any among in-hospital mortality, endotracheal
intubation and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation use.
Results: Among the 60 patients enrolled (63% males; median age: 71 years), pneumonia (42%) and acute exacerbation
of fibrosis (39%) were the two most frequent causes of ARF. A significant increase of PaO2/FiO2 ratio during NIV
treatment was detected in Group A (p = 0.010), but not in Group B. No significant difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaCO2
and pH values during NIV treatment was detected in patients with a radiological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). 22 patients (37%) suffered for a clinical failure. No significant
differences in the study outcome were detected in Group A vs. Group B, as well as among patients with a radiological
pattern of UIP vs. NSIP.
Conclusions: NIV treatment should be individualized in DILD patients with ARF according to the etiology, but not the
baseline radiological pattern, in order to improve oxygenation.

Background
Various diffuse interstitial lung diseases (DILD) have dif￾ferent etiologies and heterogeneous radiological patterns
[1,2]. The natural history of DILD is characterized by life￾threatening episodes of acute respiratory failure (ARF)
triggered by known causes, such as pulmonary infections
and acute heart failure. When an acute deterioration is of
unknown etiology, it is termed acute exacerbation of
pulmonary fibrosis [3].
During an episode of ARF, mechanical ventilation may
be considered a therapeutic option in patients with DILD.
Recruitment of poorly ventilated alveoli, unloading of re￾spiratory muscles, favorable hemodynamic impact on
coexisting decompensated acute heart failure, constitute
the potential patho-physiological rationale for the use of
mechanical ventilation during ARF in these patients. How￾ever, clinical benefits offered using this ventilatory strategy
are not well documented, and admission to ICU and inva￾sive mechanical ventilation are associated with poor out￾comes in patients with DILD [4,5].
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been recognized as
a means to avoid intubation during ARF and to reduce
the risk of complications, such as ventilation-associated
pneumonia, especially in immunosuppressed patients
[6]. NIV could be a valuable option for management of
respiratory failure in patients with DILD, especially if an

early treatment is initiated [7-9]. Recent literature has
shown that the survival of DILD patients receiving NIV
seems to be higher in comparison to those who require
invasive mechanical ventilation [4].
As well as the spectrum of DILD being extremely het￾erogeneous, the response to NIV may vary from patient
to patient. The efficacy of NIV in these patients during
ARF may depend on two factors. From one hand, the
application of a positive pressure could lead to different
results according to the natural history of the DILD that
is worse in the presence of usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP) compared to non-specific interstitial pneumonia
(NSIP) and other radiological and pathological patterns.
From the other hand, the efficacy of NIV treatment
could strictly depend on the etiology of the ARF whether
a potentially reversible trigger (i.e.: pneumonia/acute
heart failure) or an acute exacerbation of pulmonary fi￾brosis occurs.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
NIV on gas exchange improvement and clinical out￾comes in patients with DILD undergoing an episode of
ARF, according to baseline radiological patterns and eti￾ology of the ARF.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective
study of consecutive patients with DILD undergoing
NIV due to an episode of ARF at six Italian high de￾pendency units (HDU) between January 2004 and De￾cember 2009. The institutional review board of the San
Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy, approved the study,
and the informed consent was waived owing to the
retrospective nature of the study.
Records of all the enrolled patients were carefully
reviewed. Data on admission and during NIV treatment
were collected and included the following: a) demographic
information and past medical history; b) clinical, labora￾tory and radiological characteristics; c) clinical outcomes
including endotracheal intubation (ETI), treatment with
extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and in￾hospital mortality. All data were electronically sent to the
San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. A group of investiga￾tors at the HDU of the San Gerardo Hospital validated
data quality by checking for discrepancies and inconsisten￾cies before cases were entered into a database. Institu￾tional review board approval was waived in view of the
retrospective design of the study.
Each case, along with radiological findings, was pre￾sented to a clinical review committee to confirm the
presence and the type of DILD before hospitalization, in￾cluding a UIP and NSIP pattern. All available clinical,
functional and pathological data from bronchoalveolar
lavage and lung biopsy were carefully evaluated in each
patient. The review committee also defined the etiology
of the ARF. The review committee was composed of five
pulmonary and critical care physicians (SA, GM, SG, FG
and AP). All reviewers had clinical and research expe￾rience on both pulmonary fibrosis and non-invasive
ventilation.
NIV was administered as non-invasive pressure sup￾port ventilation (PSV) with a high-performance ventila￾tor, including Evita 4 (Drager), VELA (Care Fusion),
Servo 300 (Maquet) and Esprit (Philips Respironics), or
high-flow stand-alone non-invasive continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP). Criteria for application of CPAP
in the study centers included the presence of both severe
acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200)
and respiratory rate exceeding 30 breaths/minute or use
of accessory respiratory muscles or paradoxical abdom￾inal motion, in the absence of respiratory acidosis (pH <
7.35, PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg). Criteria for application of PSV
in the study centers included the presence of respiratory
acidosis (pH < 7.35, PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg) and a respiratory
rate exceeding 30 breaths/minute or use of accessory re￾spiratory muscles or paradoxical abdominal motion. NIV
was not applied if any of the following was present: 1) im￾mediate need for endotracheal intubation; 2) severely al￾tered consciousness (Kelly score > 3); and 3) shock despite
fluid optimization and use of vasopressor. Medical treat￾ment was performed according to the trigger of ARF and
local standard procedures. No subjects receiving invasive
or non-invasive pressure support ventilation before PSV/
CPAP treatment were included in this study.
Study definitions
A UIP pattern on high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the
thorax was defined by the presence of basal-predominant
reticular abnormality, mainly peripheral and subpleural,
characterized by honeycombing with or without traction
bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis. A NSIP pattern on thorax
HRCT was defined by the presence of peripheral, sub￾pleural, basal ground glass attenuation and reticular
opacity with or without consolidation, as previously de￾scribed [1].
Pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new pul￾monary infiltrate on chest radiograph or CT scan at the
time of hospitalization associated with one or more of
the following: (1) new or increased cough with or without
sputum production; (2) fever (> = 37.8°C) or hypothermia
(<35.6°C); or (3) abnormal white blood cell count (either
leukocytosis or leukopenia), or C-reactive protein values
above the local upper limit.
Acute exacerbation was defined as an acute, clinically
significant deterioration of unidentifiable cause in pa￾tients with underlying NSIP or UIP including: 1) wors￾ening of dyspnea within days to weeks (<30 days); 2)
evidence of a worsening of gas exchange; 3) new

radiographic opacities; and 4) an absence of an alterna￾tive explanation, such as infection, left heart failure, pul￾monary embolism or pneumothorax [3].
Study groups and outcomes
Among the study population three groups of patients
were identified based on the etiology of the ARF: those
with pneumonia (Group A), those with acute exacerba￾tion of fibrosis (Group B) and those with other triggers
of ARF (Group C). Patients with acute heart failure were
not considered in light of the strong evidence recom￾mending the use of NIV in this population [10].
The evaluation of gas exchange was the primary out￾come. Clinical failure and length of stay in the hospital
(LOS) were secondary clinical outcomes. Clinical failure
was defined as the occurrence of any among: in-hospital
mortality, ETI and ECMO. In-hospital mortality was
defined as death by any cause occurring during hos￾pitalization. LOS was calculated as the number of days
from the date of admission to the date of discharge.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS (version 18.0) for
Mac. Descriptive statistics were reported at baseline,
with continuous data expressed as a median (25–75
interquartile range -IQR) and categorical data expressed
as counts. Patient characteristics were compared be￾tween groups: differences of continuous data between
two groups were evaluated by Mann–Whitney test. Dif￾ferences of categorical variables between two groups
were analyzed using the X2 test or Fisher exact test
where appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered sta￾tistically significant.
Results
Study population
A total of 60 consecutive patients with DILD undergoing
NIV because of an episode of ARF were enrolled during
the study period: 63% were males and median (IQR) age
was 71 (64–76) years. Demographics, severity of disease,
clinical, laboratory and radiological findings on admis￾sion before NIV treatment are summarized in Table 1. A
total of 28 patients (47%) had a radiological pattern con￾sistent with UIP, 26 patients (44%) had NSIP and 6 (9%)
other radiological patterns, including consolidations and
ground glass. Clinically, a diagnosis of idiopathic pul￾monary fibrosis (IPF) was present in 28 patients (47%),
NSIP associated to connective tissue diseases (CTD) in 8
patients, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) in 3
patients, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in 1 patients,
idiopathic NSIP in 16 patients, hemorrhagic alveolitis in
1 patient and other diagnoses in 3 patients. A first diag￾nosis of DILD was made in two patients without a previ￾ous history of respiratory diseases.
Etiology of ARF
Insufficient clinical data were available for the review
committee to characterize the etiology of ARF in 3 pa￾tients. A definitive etiology of acute respiratory failure
was established by agreement of the review committee
in 57 patients. The most frequent causes of ARF in pa￾tients with DILD were pneumonia (26 patients, 42%)
and acute exacerbation of fibrosis (24 patients, 39%)
followed by pulmonary thromboembolism (2 patients,
3.2%), pneumothorax (1 patient; 1.6%), pulmonary neo￾plasm (1 patient, 1.6%) and other causes (3 patients; 5%).
A total of 26 patients (50%) belonged to Group A, 24 pa￾tients (39%) to Group B and 7 patients (11%) to Group C.
Gas exchange during NIV treatment of the study
population
A total of 40 patients (67%) were treated with CPAP, and
20 patients (33%) with PSV, see Table 2. The median
(IQR) time of NIV treatment among the study popula￾tion was 72 (28–121) hours. A total of 11 patients (18%)

developed intolerance to either the ventilation or the
interface during NIV treatment. Neither pharmaco￾logical sedation nor physical constraints were used in in￾tolerant patients.
At six hours of NIV treatment, a significant increase in
median PaO2/FiO2 ratio values was detected in the entire
study population in comparison to baseline (189 vs. 125,
p = 0.001). A significant increase of PaO2/FiO2 ratio at six
hours during NIV treatment was detected in patients whose
ARF was triggered by pneumonia (Group A, p = 0.010), but
not among those whose ARF was triggered by an acute ex￾acerbation of fibrosis (Group B), see Figure 1. No significant
differences at six hours during NIV treatment were de￾tected in PaCO2 or pH values in comparison to baseline in
the entire population or in the two study groups.
No significant difference was detected in PaO2/FiO2
ratio, PaCO2 or pH values at six hours during NIV treat￾ment in comparison to baseline in patients whose fibro￾sis had a radiological pattern of UIP or NSIP.
Clinical outcomes of study population
The median (IQR) LOS in the entire study population
was 18 (12–29) days. A clinical failure was detected in
22 patients (37%). Among those, 3 patients (4.6%) were
treated with ECMO, 11 patients (18%) were intubated
and 21 patients (35%) died during hospitalization, see
Table 3. Clinical failure occurred in 10 patients (39%)
whose ARF was triggered by pneumonia (Group A) and
in 11 patients (46%) whose ARF was triggered by acute
exacerbation of fibrosis (Group B), p = 0.775. No signifi￾cant differences in any of the clinical outcomes evalu￾ated during hospitalization were detected between the
two study groups. No significant differences in clinical
failure were detected among patients whose fibrosis had
a radiological pattern of UIP vs. NSIP. At the univariate
analysis the only factors significantly associated with
clinical failure were low systolic blood pressure and high
respiratory rate before NIV treatment, see Table 4.
Discussion
This study shows that in patients with DILD undergoing
an episode of ARF the improvement in gas exchange
during NIV treatment depends on the etiology of the
ARF, but not the radiological pattern of DILD. Particu￾larly, an improvement in oxygenation during NIV is de￾tected when pneumonia, but exacerbation of fibrosis, is
the triggers of ARF. The occurrence of a clinical failure
can be identified in 37% of DILD patients undergoing
NIV, with no differences between UIP and NSIP pattern
or between ARF etiologies.
So far no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the
efficacy of NIV in patients with DILD undergoing an epi￾sode of ARF. Although a lack of data exists on this topic,
NIV is often used in DILD patients during an acute deteri￾oration in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, NIV use in
this population of patients is increasingly taken into ac￾count in light of several data showing high rates of mortal￾ity in patients with DILD undergoing ETI in the ICU
[11-13]. In light of the heterogeneity in terms of both fi￾brosis and etiologies of ARF, the identification of the right
patient to which propose a trial of NIV is crucial in the
management of patients with DILD and ARF. Our study
did not identify differences in NIV response in terms of
oxygenation based on the type of DILD, but the cause of
ARF. Particularly, we indirectly confirm the efficacy of
NIV in terms of alveolar recruitment during episodes of
pneumonia in light of the improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio
during ventilation compared to spontaneous breathing.
Cosentini et al. demonstrated that the application of non￾invasive CPAP improves oxygenation in patients with
pneumonia and reduces the risk of meeting ETI criteria in
patients with severe hypoxemic ARF due to pneumonia
compared to oxygen therapy [14,15]. More recently,
Carrillo et al. demonstrated that outcome of NIV applied
to patients with severe CAP is significantly better in pa￾tients with chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases than in
denovo ARF [16]. On the other hand, the use of NIV in

patients with acute exacerbation of fibrosis does not seem
to guarantee an improvement in oxygenation in our co￾hort of patients, exposing them to possible NIV-related
adverse events, such as pneumothorax or pneumomedias￾tinum. We recently reported evidence of morphological
and physiological effects of the application of non￾invasive CPAP during ARF sustained by pneumonia in a
patient who underwent lung transplantation because of
IPF [17]. We found that the application of CPAP equally
increased lung volumes of two hemithoraces affected by
different diseases, IPF and pneumonia, evaluated by
thorax CT scan. The application of a positive pressure

on the IPF lung resulted in minimal overdistention,
while in the transplanted lung with pneumonia we de￾tected a recruitment of consolidated areas.
Our data did not allow identification of an advantage in
terms of clinical outcomes of NIV in DILD patients. The
high rate of negative outcomes recorded in our population
is in accordance with previous data and it should be
interpreted in the light of the severity of the underlying dis￾ease and of the severity of ARF. However, DILD patients
represent a population suffering a high mortality and thera￾peutic options in these subjects are very limited. NIV might
also be an alternative option in DILD patients to relieve
dyspnoea, in line with the recently published data by Nava
and coworkers on patients with end-stage cancer [18].

Our findings have important implications from both a
clinical and a research point of view. In clinical practice,
NIV could be considered an option in patients with DILD
whit an ARF triggered by pneumonia to improve oxygen￾ation. How this physiological benefit could be translated in
a better clinical outcome need to be demonstrated in a con￾trolled perspective randomized trial. A special indication for
NIV in DILD might be in those patients who have an indi￾cation for lung transplant, although no data have been pub￾lished on this topic. NIV is not a contraindication for lung
transplantation as prolonged invasive ventilation is. More￾over, NIV may theoretically work as a “bridge” for patients
on waiting list for lung transplantation as it has been shown
for other chronic rapid-evolving lung diseases, such as cys￾tic fibrosis [19]. From a research point of view, our data
could be of help in designing further prospective observa￾tional or interventional studies to demonstrate the effective￾ness of NIV, in adjunct to standard medical treatment, in
homogeneous clinical-radiological patterns of DILD.
Our study has several limitations. First, data were
retrospectively collected which may have led to potential
bias in the evaluation and characterization of the etiology
of ARF among centers as well as the collection of informa￾tion on do-not-intubate orders. However, a committee of
experts in both DILD and NIV reviewed each single case
in order to decrease this risk. In the same way, it should
be acknowledged that, although all the centers share a
long-term experience with both NIV and non-invasive
CPAP, heterogeneity exists in the way CPAP/NIV were ad￾ministered which might have had an impact on patients’
outcomes. Second, although this was a multicenter study,
the limited number of patients did not allow us to high￾light possible differences between PSV and CPAP, and led
us to use a combined clinical outcome. However, every
single component of the combined outcome is recognized
as clinical failure for NIV. Finally, ours is a heterogeneous
population of DILD patients; this is mainly due to the fact
that DILD are rare and NIV is still an emerging treatment
in these patients. In light of this, we should also acknow￾ledge as limitation of our study the fact that we were not
able to calculate an exact sample size of the study popula￾tion. The strength of this study is the evaluation of con￾secutively enrolled patients in six Italian HDUs with long
experience in the NIV use [20]. Furthermore, this is the
largest cohort of DILD patients specifically treated with
NIV, outside the ICU.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that NIV treatment should be individ￾ualized in patients with DILD undergoing an episode of
ARF according to the etiology, but the radiological pattern.
A trial of NIV may be considered in patients with ARF
caused by pneumonia in order to improve gas exchange,
although no favorable impact on clinical outcomes has
been proven so far. Larger controlled studies are needed
to confirm these preliminary findings.
