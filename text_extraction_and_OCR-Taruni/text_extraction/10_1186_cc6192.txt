Abstract
Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication
of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The lack of early biomarkers
has impaired our ability to intervene in a timely manner. We
previously showed in a small cohort of patients that plasma
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), measured
using a research enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is an
early predictive biomarker of AKI after CPB. In this study we
tested whether a point-of-care NGAL device can predict AKI
after CPB in a larger cohort.
Methods First, in a cross-sectional pilot study including 40
plasma samples (NGAL range 60 to 730 ng/ml) and 12
calibration standards (NGAL range 0 to 1,925 ng/ml), NGAL
measurements by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by
Triage® NGAL Device (Biosite Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were
highly correlated (r = 0.94). Second, in a subsequent
prospective uncontrolled cohort study, 120 children undergoing
CPB were enrolled. Plasma was collected at baseline and at
frequent intervals for 24 hours after CPB, and analyzed for
NGAL using the Triage® NGAL device. The primary outcome
was AKI, which was defined as a 50% or greater increase in
serum creatinine.
Results AKI developed in 45 patients (37%), but the diagnosis
using serum creatinine was delayed by 2 to 3 days after CPB. In
contrast, mean plasma NGAL levels increased threefold within
2 hours of CPB and remained significantly elevated for the
duration of the study. By multivariate analysis, plasma NGAL at
2 hours after CPB was the most powerful independent predictor
of AKI (β = 0.004, P < 0.0001). For the 2-hour plasma NGAL
measurement, the area under the curve was 0.96, sensitivity was
0.84, and specificity was 0.94 for prediction of AKI using a cut￾off value of 150 ng/ml. The 2 hour postoperative plasma NGAL
levels strongly correlated with change in creatinine (r = 0.46, P
< 0.001), duration of AKI (r = 0.57, P < 0.001), and length of
hospital stay (r = 0.44, P < 0.001). The 12-hour plasma NGAL
strongly correlated with mortality (r = 0.48, P = 0.004) and all
measures of morbidity mentioned above.
Conclusion Accurate measurements of plasma NGAL are
obtained using the point-of-care Triage® NGAL device. Plasma
NGAL is an early predictive biomarker of AKI, morbidity, and
mortality after pediatric CPB.
Introduction
Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery is the most frequent
major surgical procedure performed in hospitals worldwide,
with well over a million operations undertaken each year in
adults alone [1]. Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously referred
to as acute renal failure, is a frequent and serious complication
encountered in 30% to 50% of subjects after CPB [2,3]. AKI
requiring dialysis occurs in up to 5% of these cases, in whom
the mortality rate approaches 80%, and is the strongest inde￾pendent risk factor for death with an odds ratio of 7.9 [4]. Even
AKI = acute kidney injury; AUC = area under the curve; CPB = cardiopulmonary bypass; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; NGAL = 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.

minor degrees of postoperative AKI, as manifest by only a 0.2
to 0.3 mg/dl rise in serum creatinine from baseline, predict a
significant increase in short-term mortality [5,6]. AKI after car￾diac surgery is also associated with a number of adverse out￾comes, including prolonged intensive care and hospital stay,
dialysis dependency, diminished quality of life, and increased
long-term mortality [7-9].
Clinical investigations have identified several risk factors asso￾ciated with the development of AKI after CPB, the majority
related to either impaired renal perfusion or decreased renal
reserve, and have resulted in the development of clinical scor￾ing systems for the prediction of AKI [10-13]. However, these
tools have not been validated across medical centers and have
focused primarily on identifying the small number of high-risk,
dialysis-requiring patients. Concomitant advances in the basic
sciences have illuminated the pathogenesis of AKI and have
paved the way to successful therapeutic approaches in animal
models [14]. However, translational research efforts in
humans have yielded disappointing results, and no corre￾sponding preventive or therapeutic strategy has been suc￾cessful [2,15]. A major reason for the failure to find an effective
treatment in patients is the paucity of early biomarkers for AKI,
akin to troponins in acute myocardial disease, and hence a
delay in initiating therapy [16]. In current clinical practice, the
'gold standard' for identification and classification of AKI is
dependent on serial serum creatinine measurements [17],
which are especially unreliable during acute changes in kidney
function [15,16].
We utilized a genome-wide interrogation strategy to identify
kidney genes that are induced very early after AKI in animal
models, whose protein products might serve as novel early
biomarkers. We identified neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin (NGAL) as one of the most upregulated genes in the
kidney soon after ischemic injury [18-20]. NGAL protein was
also markedly induced in kidney tubule cells, and easily
detected in the plasma and urine in animal models of ischemic
and nephrotoxic AKI [18-22]. The expression of NGAL protein
was also dramatically increased in kidney tubules of humans
with ischemic, septic, and post-transplant AKI [23,24]. Impor￾tantly, NGAL in the plasma was found to be an early predictive
biomarker of AKI in a variety of acute clinical settings in pilot
studies [25]. In a cohort of 20 patients who developed AKI 2
to 3 days after cardiac surgery, plasma NGAL measured using
a research enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
elevated within 2 to 6 hours after CPB [16]. Preliminary results
using the research-based assay also suggest that plasma
NGAL measurements predict AKI after contrast administration
[26]. The availability of a validated point-of-care tool for NGAL
measurements could revolutionize renal diagnostics in critical
care situations [27]. Therefore, the first objective of the
present study was to determine whether a rapid, standardized
point-of-care NGAL assay correlates with the research-based
assay. The second objective was to determine the utility of the
point-of-care NGAL assay as a predictive biomarker of AKI
after CPB in a large prospective pediatric cohort.
Materials and methods
Patients and study design
This investigation was approved by the institutional review
board of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All
children undergoing elective CPB for surgical correction or
palliation of congenital heart lesions between January 2004
and June 2006 were prospectively enrolled. We obtained writ￾ten informed consent from the legal guardian of every partici￾pant before enrolment. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing
renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular dis￾ease, and use of nephrotoxic drugs before or during the study
period.
To obviate postoperative volume depletion and prerenal azo￾temia, all patients received at least 80% of their maintenance
fluid requirements during the first 24 hours after surgery and
100% maintenance subsequently. We obtained spot plasma
samples at baseline and at frequent intervals (2, 6, 12, and 24
hours) after initiation of CPB. Samples were stored at -80°C.
Serum creatinine was measured by the hospital clinical labo￾ratory at baseline and routinely monitored at least twice daily
during the first 2 days after CPB, and at least daily after the
third postoperative day.
The primary outcome variable was the development of AKI,
defined as a 50% or greater increase in serum creatinine from
baseline. This corresponds to the risk phase of the RIFLE (risk,
injury, failure, loss, and end-stage kidney) criteria for diagnosis
of AKI [17]. Other outcomes included percentage change in
serum creatinine, days in AKI, dialysis requirement, length of
hospital stay, and mortality. Other variables we obtained
included age, sex, ethnic origin, CPB time, previous heart sur￾gery, and urine output.
In a pilot cross-sectional study, we measured NGAL concen￾trations in 40 plasma samples and 11 calibration standards to
determine the correlation between the two assay methods
described below. In a subsequent prospective study, serial
plasma samples from 120 children undergoing CPB were
assayed for NGAL using the Triage® device (Biosite Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA) to assess its ability to predict AKI and other
adverse outcomes.
NGAL analysis using the Triage® point-of-care device
The Triage® NGAL test is a point-of-care, fluorescence-based
immunoassay used in conjunction with the Triage Meter
(Biosite Inc.) for the rapid quantitative measurement of NGAL
concentration in EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood or plasma
specimens. The assay device is a single-use plastic cartridge
that contains an NGAL-specific monoclonal antibody conju￾gated to a fluorescent nanoparticle, NGAL antigen immobi￾lized on a solid phase, and stabilizers. In addition, the device is

engineered with integrated control features including positive
and negative control immunoassays, which ensure that the
test performs properly and that the reagents are functional.
The test is performed by inoculating several drops of whole
blood or plasma into the sample port where the specimen
moves through an integrated filter to separate cells from
plasma. The plasma then reconstitutes the fluorescent anti￾body conjugate detection nanoparticles and flows down the
diagnostic lane via capillary action. NGAL present in the spec￾imen prevents binding of the fluorescent detection particles to
the solid phase immobilized in the detection zone, such that
the analyte concentration is inversely proportional to the fluo￾rescence detected. Separate solid phase zones are located
along the same diagnostic lane for the control assay systems.
The device is then inserted into the Triage Meter, a portable
fluorescence spectrometer, and quantitative measurements of
NGAL concentration in the range from 60 to 1,300 ng/ml are
displayed on the meter screen and/or printout in approximately
15 minutes. Calibration information is relayed to the meter via
a lot-specific EPROM chip (the code chip module).
NGAL analysis by ELISA
The plasma NGAL ELISA was performed using an established
and validated assay as previously described [16,26]. Briefly,
microtiter plates precoated with a mouse monoclonal antibody
raised against human NGAL (#HYB211-05; AntibodyShop,
Gentofte, Denmark) were blocked with buffer containing 1%
bovine serum albumin, coated with 100 μl of samples (plasma)
or standards (NGAL concentrations ranging from 1 to 1,000
ng/ml), and incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal antibody
against human NGAL (#HYB211-01B; AntibodyShop) fol￾lowed by avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Dako,
Carpinteria, California, USA). TMB substrate (BD Bio￾sciences, San Jose, California, USA) was added for color
development, which was read after 30 minutes at 450 nm with
a microplate reader (Benchmark Plus; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). All measurements were made in triplicate. Precoated
plates can be refrigerated and used for several days, and the
entire ELISA procedure is typically completed in 4 hours. The
inter- and intra-assay coefficient variations were under 5% for
batched samples analyzed on the same day, and under 10%
for the same sample measured 6 months apart. The laboratory
investigators were blinded to the sample sources and clinical
outcomes until the end of the study.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Either a two-sample t-test
or Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used for continuous vari￾ables, whereas χ2 or Fisher's exact test was used for categor￾ical variables. The associations between variables were
assessed by Spearman rank order correlation analysis. Univar￾iate and multivariate stepwise regression analyses were
undertaken to assess predictors of AKI after CPB. Potential
independent predictor variables included age, sex, ethnicity,
CPB time, and history of prior cardiac surgery. To calculate the
sensitivity and specificity for the plasma NGAL measurements
at varying cut-off values, a conventional receiver operating
characteristic curve was generated and the area under the
curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the accuracy of
plasma NGAL as a biomarker. An AUC of 0.5 is no better than
expected by chance, whereas a value of 1.0 signifies a perfect
biomarker. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Verification of the Triage® point-of-care NGAL device
The Triage® NGAL test was found to have a minimum detect￾able NGAL concentration of 60 ng/ml and an upper limit of
detection of 1,300 ng/ml, and exhibited a linear response to
NGAL concentration over this range. The average within-day
coefficient of variance was 11%, with a total precision of 14%
when assessed over 20 consecutive days at three NGAL lev￾els spread across the reportable range. Biologically relevant
levels of hemoglobin, triolein, bilirubin, and rheumatoid factors
did not interfere with the recovery of NGAL. Commonly used
pharmaceuticals and contrast agents tested at therapeutically
relevant concentrations also did not interfere with the Triage®
NGAL Test (Triage® NGAL product insert; Biosite Inc.).
The cross-sectional phase of this study was designed to verify
the Triage® NGAL device against the research-based NGAL
ELISA assay. As shown in Figure 1, NGAL concentrations in
40 random plasma samples from patients undergoing CPB
(NGAL range 60 to 730 ng/ml) and 11 calibration standards
(NGAL range 0 to 1,925 ng/ml) determined using the two
assays were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.94, 95% confi￾dence interval 0.89 to 0.96; P < 0.001). From a linear regres￾sion analysis, the observed slope was 0.671 (95% confidence
interval 0.600 to 0.741) with an intercept of 48.82 (95% con￾fidence interval 18.66 to 78.99). The slight deviation from unity
observed between the two methods in this correlation analysis
probably arose from differences in NGAL concentration
assignments for the samples used to calibrate these two
assays.
NGAL as a predictor of acute kidney injury and other 
adverse outcomes
In a subsequent prospective study, serial plasma samples from
120 children who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
assayed for NGAL using the Triage® device to assess its abil￾ity to predict AKI and other adverse outcomes. Forty-five
patients (37%) met the criteria for AKI within a 3-day period.
However, the increase in serum creatinine by 50% or greater
from baseline was delayed by 2 to 3 days after CPB. Based on
this primary outcome, we classified patients into those with
and those without AKI. No differences were noted with
respect to age, sex, or race (Table 1). All patients received a
similar postoperative fluid regimen, and there were no differ￾ences in the volume status or urine output between the two
groups.

In patients that developed AKI, the duration of CPB was sig￾nificantly longer, and the clinical outcomes were significantly
worse. The serum creatinine rose by a greater percentage in
the AKI group, and both length of hospitalization and mortality
rate were significantly higher (Table 1). Among patients with
AKI, two (4.5%) required dialysis, primarily for fluid overload.
There were a total of seven deaths, all in the AKI group. The
causes of death were multiorgan failure in five and sepsis in
two patients.
Plasma NGAL measurements at baseline were comparable in
the AKI and non-AKI groups (Table 1). In the non-AKI group
there was a small but statistically significant increase in plasma
NGAL at 2 hours after CPB, which normalized back to base￾line levels at the 12-hour and 24-hour time points. In marked
contrast, in patients who subsequently developed AKI there
was a robust threefold increase in plasma NGAL at 2 hours
after CPB, which persisted at the 12-hour and 24-hour time
points (Figure 2).
To assess independent predictors for the development of AKI
in the entire cohort, multivariate logistic regression was per￾formed. All variables that were found by univariate analysis to
display a P < 0.1 were entered into the model. Plasma NGAL
measurement at 2 hours after CPB was the most powerful
independent predictor of AKI (β = 0.004, P < 0.0001). Other
predictors of AKI included history of previous cardiac surgery
(β = 0.22, P = 0.003) and CPB time (β = 0.001, P = 0.03),
yielding a model R2 = 0.64. Age, sex, and race were not inde￾pendent predictors of AKI.

To test the hypothesis that plasma NGAL levels measured
soon after CPB could be used to predict eventual clinical out￾comes, a Spearman rank order correlation analysis was per￾formed. The 2-hour NGAL levels strongly correlated with
percentage change in serum creatinine (r = 0.46, P < 0.001),
duration of AKI (r = 0.57, P < 0.001), and length of hospital
stay (r = 0.44, P < 0.001). The 12-hour NGAL levels strongly
correlated with mortality (r = 0.48, P = 0.004) as well as all of
the measures of morbidity mentioned above.
To assess the utility of NGAL measurements at varying cut-off
values to predict AKI, a conventional receiver operating char￾acteristic curve was generated and the AUC calculated. Table
2 lists the derived sensitivities, specificities, and predictive val￾ues at different cut-off concentrations. For plasma NGAL at 2
hours after CPB, sensitivity and specificity were optimal at the
150 ng/ml cut-off, with an AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence inter￾val 0.94 to 0.99) for the prediction of AKI (Figure 3).
Discussion
Serum creatinine is an inadequate marker for AKI [25]. First,
more than 50% of renal function must be lost before an eleva￾tion in serum creatinine is detected. Second, serum creatinine
does not accurately depict kidney function until a steady state
has been reached, which may require several days. Although
animal studies have shown that AKI can be prevented and/or
treated using several maneuvers, these must be instituted very
early after the insult, well before the rise in serum creatinine
becomes apparent. Our study indicates that monitoring of
plasma NGAL levels can potentially provide a very early
warning to providers of critical care. The 2-hour plasma NGAL
level measured using the Triage® NGAL device was an excel￾lent biomarker for the subsequent development of AKI and its
complications. The assay is facile and performed on the Triage
Meter with quantitative results available within approximately
15 minutes, and requires only microliter quantities of whole
blood or plasma. The assay is autocalibrated and includes
reactive internal controls that run with every sample applied. It
has been suggested that a clinically acceptable assay for diag￾nosing AKI should be a robust system that can measure the
appropriate analyte rapidly day or night [28]. The Triage NGAL
test provides quantitative NGAL measurements in minutes
and is deployable directly to the point of patient care, and thus
satisfies these requirements. Furthermore, the Triage Meter
and test devices for cardiac markers have been adopted by
clinical institutions world wide, providing further evidence that
this system is robust.
Human NGAL, a member of the lipocalin superfamily, was ini￾tially described as a 25 kDa protein that is covalently bound to
gelatinase in neutrophils and expressed at low concentrations
in normal kidney, trachea, lungs, stomach, and colon [29].
NGAL expression is induced in injured epithelia, including
lung, colon, and especially kidney [18-25]. Emerging experi￾mental and clinical evidence indicates that in the early phases
of AKI from diverse etiologies, NGAL accumulates within two
distinct pools, namely a systemic and a renal pool. It has been
demonstrated that AKI results in increased NGAL mRNA
expression in distant organs, especially the liver and spleen,
and the over-expressed NGAL protein is most likely released

into the circulation and constitutes the systemic pool [30,31].
Additional contributions to the systemic pool in AKI may derive
from the fact that NGAL is a known acute phase reactant and
may be released from neutrophils, macrophages, and other
immune cells [32]. Furthermore, any decrease in glomerular fil￾tration rate resulting from AKI would be expected to decrease
the clearance of NGAL, with further accumulation in the sys￾temic pool. Gene expression studies in AKI have also shown
rapid upregulation of NGAL mRNA in the thick ascending limb
of Henle's loop and the collecting ducts, with resultant synthe￾sis of NGAL protein in the distal nephron (the renal pool) and
secretion into the urine where it comprises the major fraction
of urinary NGAL [30,31].
This study lends support to our previous findings in a small
cohort of 20 patients who developed AKI 2 to 3 days after car￾diac surgery, in whom plasma NGAL measured by a research
ELISA was elevated within 2 to 6 hours following CPB [16]. In
both the previous and the present study, patients who
developed AKI also encountered a longer CPB time, raising
the possibility that plasma NGAL levels reflected the duration
of CPB rather than kidney injury. A larger randomized control￾led trial will be required to determine whether plasma NGAL
levels truly predict AKI or whether they merely reflect longer
CPB times. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated
that the utility of plasma NGAL measurements is not restricted
only to the CPB population. For example, plasma NGAL is also
an early, sensitive, specific, and predictive biomarker of AKI
after contrast administration [26].
Our study has several strengths. First, we prospectively
recruited a relatively homogeneous cohort of pediatric patients
in whom the only obvious etiology for AKI would be the result
of CPB. These patients comprise an ideal and important pop￾ulation for the study of AKI biomarkers, because they do not
exhibit common comorbid variables that complicate similar
studies in adults, such as diabetes, hypertension, atheroscle￾rosis, and nephrotoxin use [33]. Second, all patients started
with normal kidney function, and the study design allowed for
the precise temporal definition of altered plasma NGAL con￾centrations and a direct comparison with subsequent changes
in serum creatinine. Our results clearly indicate that plasma
NGAL is a powerful early biomarker of AKI that precedes the
increase in serum creatinine by several hours to days. The
magnitude of rise supports the notion that plasma NGAL is a
highly discriminatory biomarker with a wide dynamic range and
cut-off values that allow for early risk stratification. Third, this is
the first example of how a standardized point-of-care platform
may be useful for predicting AKI using plasma samples in crit￾ical care settings. The majority of biomarkers of AKI described
thus far have been measured in the urine [25]. Urinary diag￾nostics do have several advantages, including the noninvasive
nature of sample collection, the reduced number of interfering
proteins, and the potential for the development of self-testing
kits. However, several disadvantages also exist, including the
lack of sample from patients with severe oliguria, and potential
changes in urinary biomarker concentration induced by
hydration status and diuretic therapy. Plasma-based diagnos￾tics have revolutionized many facets of critical care, as exem￾plified by the use of troponins for the early diagnosis of acute
myocardial infarction and the value of B-type natriuretic pep￾tide for prognostication in acute coronary syndrome.
This study has important limitations. First, it is a single-center
uncontrolled cohort study of pediatric patients with congenital
heart defects undergoing elective CPB. Our results, although
provocative and of clear statistical significance, will certainly
need to be validated in a larger randomized prospective trial,
including adults with the usual confounding variables and
comorbid conditions that normally accumulate with increasing
age. Until the appropriate studies are completed, the results
cannot be extrapolated to the adult CPB population. In addi￾tion, a larger randomized controlled trial in children will be
required to determine whether plasma NGAL levels truly pre￾dict AKI or whether they merely reflect longer CPB times. Sec￾ond, ours was a cohort with normal kidney function at
recruitment, and it will be important to confirm our findings in
documented high-risk settings such as pre-existing kidney
dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and concomitant nephrotoxic
drug use. Third, other potential confounding variables that
could lead to AKI in this population, such as inotrope support
and complexity of surgery, were not considered in the multivar￾Table 2

iate analysis. It is likely that these parameters contributed to
the AKI in our cohort, in addition to the duration of CPB.
Fourth, in addition to NGAL, simultaneous examination of
other plasma and urinary biomarkers as potential predictors of
AKI may be informative [25]. It is likely that not one single
biomarker such as NGAL but rather a collection of strategically
selected candidates will provide the hitherto elusive panel for
early and rapid diagnosis of AKI.
In the critical care setting, an early elevation in plasma NGAL
would trigger immediate intervention. At the very least, clini￾cians informed of such a situation would avoid the use of addi￾tional nephrotoxins, and optimize hydration and renal perfusion
to prevent further injury. The ability to predict which patients
will develop AKI after CPB may also add substantively to exist￾ing clinical scoring systems, and enable early initiation of inter￾ventions to change the dismal outcomes associated with this
all too common clinical problem.
Conclusion
AKI is a frequent and serious complication after CPB. The pau￾city of early biomarkers for AKI, akin to troponins in acute myo￾cardial disease, has crippled our ability to initiate timely
therapy in the critical care setting. In this study, we have shown
that rapid and reliable measurements of plasma NGAL are
obtained using the newly developed point-of-care Triage®
NGAL device, and that plasma NGAL is an early predictive
biomarker of AKI, morbidity, and mortality after pediatric CPB.

Key messages
• Rapid and reliable measurements of plasma NGAL are 
obtained using the newly developed point-of-care 
Triage® NGAL device.
• Whereas the diagnosis of AKI using serum creatinine 
was delayed by 2 to 3 days, mean plasma NGAL levels 
increased threefold within 2 hours of CPB.
• Plasma NGAL at 2 hours after CPB was the most pow￾erful independent predictor of AKI.
• For the 2-hour plasma NGAL measurement, the AUC 
was 0.96, sensitivity was 0.84, and specificity was 0.94 
for prediction of AKI using a cut-off value of 150 ng/ml.
• The 2-hour plasma NGAL levels strongly correlated with 
severity and duration of AKI, and length of hospital stay. 
In addition, the 12-hour plasma NGAL strongly corre￾lated with mortality.
