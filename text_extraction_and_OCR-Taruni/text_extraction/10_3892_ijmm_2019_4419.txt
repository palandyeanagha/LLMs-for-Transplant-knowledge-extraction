Abstract. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is one of the 
primary methods of treating coronary heart disease (CHD); 
however, vein graft restenosis is a major limiting factor of the 
effectiveness of CABG. Emerging evidence has indicated that 
miR‑423 is associated with vascular diseases. Additionally, 
upregulation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with 
thrombospondin motifs‑7 (ADAMTS‑7) contributes to 
neointima formation by promoting the proliferation and 
migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibiting 
the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. The aim 
of the present study was to examine the effects of miR‑423 
target, ADAMTS‑7, on regulating vein graft disease and 
identify novel biomarkers for use in therapy of vein graft 
failure (VGF). Aberrant expression of miR‑423 in plasma of 
patients with CHD prior to and following CABG confirms 
that miR‑423 may be a suitable target for preventing VGF. 
Furthermore, a dual‑luciferase reporter gene assay indicated 
that miR‑423 directly interacted with ADAMTS‑7 and 
suppressed its expression. Ectopic expression of miR‑423 
suppressed ADAMTS‑7, resulting in decreased proliferation 
and migration rates of human umbilical vein smooth muscle 
cells by targeting ADAMTS‑7, but resulted in increased 
proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothe￾lial cells in vitro. Overexpression of miR‑423 also enhanced 
re‑endothelialization and decreased neointimal formation in 
a rat vein graft model. In conclusion, the results of the present 
study demonstrated that the miR‑423/ADAMTS‑7 axis may 
possess potential clinical value for the prevention and treat￾ment of restenosis in patients with CHD following CABG.
Introduction
In recent years, the incidence and mortality rates of patients 
with coronary heart disease (CHD) have increased annually, 
and it is one of the primary causes of mortality of hospital￾ized patients (1,2). Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is 
one of the primary means of treating patients with CHD (3,4). 
At present, the great saphenous veins are the most frequently 
used vessel for graft material for CABG. Although significant 
improvements have been made in surgical techniques and 
surgical instruments, vein graft failure (VGF) remains a 
frequent outcome in patients who have undergone CABG, and 
seriously limits the effectiveness of surgery and consequent 
prognosis (5,6). Studies analyzing CABG operations over a 
10‑year period have indicated that the incidence of VGF is 
>50%. Of these failures, >90% are acute VGF that occurred 
within 1 month following surgery and were the result of an 
acute thrombosis (7‑9). Regular anticoagulation therapy may 
decrease the incidence of acute VGF. However, >60% of 
chronic VGF occurring in a 10 year period following CABG 
was due to the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle 
cells (SMCs) (10,11). Furthermore, the proliferation and migra￾tion of SMCs may mediate platelet adhesion and atheromatous 
plaque formation, which may aggravate VGF (12). However, 
the mechanism of SMCs proliferation and migration in VGF 
remains unclear. There are no effective therapeutic means of 
inhibiting the proliferation and migration of SMCs. Therefore, 
determining the mechanism of the proliferation and migration 
of SMCs in VGF has been the subject of increased attention in 
cardiac surgery research.
MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of non‑coding RNAs, 
~22 nucleotides in length, with regulatory functions that serve 
a pivotal role in the regulation of developmental timing, cell 
proliferation and migration. Continuous studies investigating 
the functions of miRNAs have demonstrated the associa￾tion between miRNA and cardiovascular diseases (13,14). A 
number of studies have indicated that miRNAs regulate the 
Upregulation of miR‑423 improves autologous vein 
graft restenosis via targeting ADAMTS‑7

proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) 
and SMCs (15‑18). Inhibition of vascular SMC is an effective 
method of preventing VGF (19,20). The plasma expression 
level of miR‑423 was upregulated in patients with CHD
following CABG (21). Previous studies revealed abnormal 
expression of miR‑423 in heart disease (22‑24). In addition, 
miR‑423 has been reported to be involved in regulating the 
development of various vascular diseases, including athero￾sclerosis (25), myocardial infarction (26), diabetic vascular 
complications (27) and lymphoma (28). However, the role of 
miR‑423 in regulating the proliferation and migration of ECs 
and SMCs to mediate VGF remains unclear.
A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin 
motifs‑7 (ADAMTS‑7), the 7th member of the ADAMTS 
family to be identified, serves a vital role in multiple 
biological processes, including embryogenesis, vasculogenesis 
and blood coagulation. For example, increased expression 
of ADAMTS‑7 enhanced the proliferation and migration 
capacity of SMCs (29). Upregulation of ADAMTS‑7 promoted 
atherosclerosis by regulating degradation and remodeling 
of the vascular matrix (30). Wang et al (31) suggested that 
ADAMTS‑7 overexpression accelerated the progression of 
carotid artery injury in rats by promoting the proliferation and 
migration of SMCs. Furthermore, ADAMTS‑7 is involved in 
intima hyperplasia following vascular injury (32). However, 
the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. Therefore, 
the importance of ADAMTS‑7 in vein graft restenosis requires 
additional investigation.
In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to measure 
the expression levels of miR‑423 in plasma, and in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human 
umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs), and the 
association between miR‑423 and ADAMTS‑7 was assessed. 
A potential interaction between miR‑423 and ADAMTS‑7 
was hypothesized to regulate the proliferation and migration 
of HUVSMCs and HUVECs in vitro. Furthermore, the role of 
miR‑423 overexpression in a rat vein graft model was exam￾ined in vivo.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement. The present study obtained approval from 
The Ethics Committee of The First People's Hospital of Yunnan 
Province (approval no. 2017YYLH018) and complied with the 
guidelines and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All 
participants provided written informed consent. Experiments 
involving animals were conducted according to the guidelines 
of the Animal Care and Use Committees at The First People's 
Hospital of Yunnan Province.
Plasma specimens. For the clinical part of the present study, 
15 patients (age, 62.279.04 years; 9 males and 6 females) who 
were preparing to undergo CABG surgery and 10 healthy 
volunteers (age, 58.6±4.48 years; 5 males and 5 females) 
from urban and rural areas were recruited. The patients 
were recruited at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery 
of The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province between 
December 2017 to March 2018. The healthy volunteers were 
recruited at the medical examination center of The First 
People's Hospital of Yunnan Province between December 2017 
to March 2018. Peripheral blood samples (2 ml) were collected 
from the patients into EDTA tubes 1 day prior to and 1, 5, 
10 and 20 days following surgery in both patients and healthy 
volunteers. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immedi￾ately and stored at ‑80˚C for subsequent experiments.
Cell culture. HUVECs and HUVSMCs were obtained from the 
BeNa Culture Collection and 293T cells were purchased from 
the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in 
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Inc.) containing 1% penicillin‑streptomycin and 
10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 37˚C and 
5% CO2.
Cell transfection. A total of 24 h prior to transfection, HUVECs 
and HUVSMCs were seeded in 6‑well plates at a density of 
2x105 cells/well and incubated overnight. Subentry, 50 nM 
miR‑423 mimic, 100 nM miR‑423 inhibitor and 50 nM nega￾tive control were transfected into HUVECs and HUVSMCs 
using Lipofectamine™ 3000 reagent and Opti‑MEM medium 
(Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the 
manufacturer's protocols, and incubated for 4 h. The mixed 
solution was then replaced with complete growth medium and 
cultured for 24 h. The miR‑423 mimics, inhibitor, pcDNA3.1 
ADAMTS‑7, and control (blank plasmid) were purchased 
from Tolo Biotech Co., Ltd. The Sequences corresponding to 
miR‑423 mimic were: 5'‑GCC​TGAGGGGCAGAGAGC‑3', 
miR‑423 inhibitor, 5'‑ATC​TTTGGTGG​CCGTAGACC​T‑3', 
and scrambled negative control, 5'‑GCC​TAA​CTGTGT​CAG
AAGGAA‑3'.
RT‑qPCR. Total RNA was isolated from cultured plasma and 
cells using TRIzol® reagent (Qiagen GmbH) and revere‑tran￾scribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit 
using a gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio, Inc.). RT‑qPCR Master mix 
was purchased from (Takara Bio, Inc.). The sequence of the 
primers for qPCR are presented in Table I. U6 was used as an 
internal control. The 2‑∆∆Cq method (33) was used to calculate 
the relative expression of miR‑423. qPCR was performed in 
triplicate.
CCK‑8 assay. Cell Counting Kit‑8 (Sigma‑Aldrich; Merck 
KGaA) was used to assess the proliferation rates of the 
HUVECs and HUVSMCs. Cells were seeded in 96‑well plates 
at a density of 1x105 cells per well and cultured with 5% CO2
at 37˚C for 2 h to allow cells to adhere. A total of 10 µl CCK‑8 
solution was added to each well and mixed, and cells were 
incubated for an additional 2 h at 37˚C. A dual‑wavelength 
microplate reader was used to measure proliferation at 450 nm 
(Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Assays were performed in triplicate.
Transwell migration assay. A total of 2x105 cells/ml HUVECs 
or HUVSMCs were plated in 200 µl serum‑free medium in 
the upper layer of the Transwell chambers (Corning, Inc.) and 
800 µl medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to 
the bottom chamber. After incubation for 24 h at 37˚C, the 
cells that had migrated were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
at 37˚C, rinsed three times with PBS, stained with 0.1% crystal 
violet for 10 min at 37˚C and rinsed three times with PBS.

The images of migrated cells were taken using a light micro￾scope (Olympus Corporation). For quantification, 5 randomly 
selected fields were analyzed at magnification, x40.
miR‑423 target prediction. TargetScan 7.2 (http://www.
Targetscan.org) was performed to predict the target genes of 
miR‑423 according to the previous studies (34‑37).
Dual‑luciferase reporter gene assay. The 3'‑UTR fragments of 
ADAMTS‑7 containing the wild‑type (WT) miR‑423‑binding 
site or a mutant (MUT) miR‑423‑binding site were amplified by 
Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. and cloned into the pmirGLO 
luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega Corporation). The 
generated luciferase reporter plasmids were designated as 
WT‑ADAMTS‑7‑3'UTR and MUT‑ADAMTS‑7‑3'UTR. 
WT‑ADAMTS‑7‑3'UTR or MUT‑ADAMTS‑7‑3'UTR were 
co‑transfected with miR‑423 mimics (50 nM) or mimics 
control (50 nM) into 293T cells using Lipofectamine® 3000 
reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). After 
48 h of incubation at 37˚C, the activity of luciferase was 
determined using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay system 
(cat. no. PR‑E1960; Promega Corporation). The firefly lucif￾erase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted for western 
blot analysis. Briefly, total proteins were extracted from tissues 
samples or cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Beijing Solarbio 
Science & Technology Co., Ltd) and protein concentration 
was determined using a BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Inc.). Protein (40 µg/lane) from each sample was 
separated by 12% SDS‑PAGE and transferred onto PVDF 
membranes (Sigma‑Aldrich; Merck KGaA). The membranes 
were blocked at 37˚C for 2 h with 5% fat‑free milk diluted 
with TBS containing 0.1% Tween‑20. Subsequently, the PVDF 
membranes were incubated overnight at 4˚C with the primary 
antibodies against ADAMTS‑7 (cat. no. ab203027; 1:1,000; 
Abcam), α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA; cat. no. ab32575; 
1:1,000; Abcam), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2; 
cat. no. ab215986; 1:1,000; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab219372; 
1:1,000; Abcam) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA; cat. no. ab92552; 1:1,000; Abcam). After washing, the 
membranes were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C with horseradish 
peroxidase‑conjugated secondary antibodies (cat. nos. ab6721 
and ab6728; 1:500; Abcam) at 37˚C for 2 h. The signal was 
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent 
(Bio‑Rad Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ 
1.8.0 software (National Institute of Health). The expression 
levels of protein in each sample were normalized to GAPDH.
Immunohistochemistry assay. Vessel graft wall tissues 
were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h 
at 37˚C. Subsequently, tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 
4 µm‑thick slices were dewaxed and rehydrated in a graded 
series of ethanol solutions (50, 75, 85, 95 and 100%; 5 min per 
solution). Xylene and a graded series of ethanol (100, 95, 85, and 
75%) were used to dewax and hydrate the samples, followed by 
30 min of antigen retrieval in Tris‑EDTA (pH 9.0) in a 720 W
microwave. Subsequently, a DAB horseradish peroxidase color 
development kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) with a 
Ki‑67 antibody (cat. no. ab15580; 1:1,000; Abcam) was used 
to stain the samples at room temperature for 15 min. The, 
slides were then dyed with hematoxylin for 30 sec at 37˚C, 
dehydrated and fixed, and sealed with neutral glue. Stained 
images were observed and photographed under a fluorescence 
microscope (Olympus Corporation) at magnification, x400.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson staining. 
Whole vessel graft lumen tissues obtained from the rat vein 
graft models were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformal￾dehyde for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, samples 
were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks. Blocks 
of 6‑µm thickness were cut and stained at room temperature 
using hematoxylin for 20 min and eosin for 5 min to measure 
the neointimal thickness. Meanwhile, sections of rat vein 
grafts were also stained with Masson's trichrome for the 
evaluation of collagen expression. Masson's trichrome kit 
(cat. no. Mst‑8003/8004; Fuzhou Maixin Biotech Co., Ltd.) 
was used at room temperature according to the manufacturer's 
protocol, and observed under a light microscope (magnifica￾tion, x200; Olympus Corporation).
Rat vein graft models. A total of 30 male Sprague‑Dawley rats 
(8‑9 week‑old; weight, 250‑300 g) were purchased from the 
Experimental Animal Center of Kunming Medical University. 
All animals were housed in an animal facility with a 12:12 h 
light: Dark cycle at 18‑22˚C and 40‑60% humidity, and had 
ad libitum access to rodent chow and water. Subsequently, 
all rats were anesthetized with 300 mg/kg chloral hydrate by 
intraperitoneal injection and systemically heparinized, and no 
rats exhibited signs of peritonitis following the administration 
of chloral hydrate. Next, all rats were randomly separated into 
three groups, with 10 rats per group. A right sternocleidomas￾toid incision was performed in all the groups. Subsequently, 
exposure of the right jugular vein of a sufficient size was 
performed and a section ~2 cm was trimmed for vessel graft. 
Then, the vessel graft to the right carotid artery was replaced. 
During surgery, 8 nmol miR‑423 agomir dissolved in normal 
saline (0.9%) according to the manufacturer's instructions, 
was perfused into the vein graft under a distending pressure 
of 20 mmHg for 10 min at room temperature prior to the arte￾riovenous anastomosis. Rats in the sham group were injected

with the same volume of saline at the same location. Rats in all 
groups were sacrificed immediately, and the jugular vein was 
harvested and further analyzed.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS v.22.0 software (IBM Corp.). Data are presented 
as the mean ± standard deviation. Differences between 
multiple groups were analyzed using a one‑way analysis of 
variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. A Student's t‑test 
was used to analyze differences between two groups. P<0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Expression of miR‑423 in patients with CHD following CABG 
surgery. To investigate the effects of miR‑423 on autologous 
vein graft restenosis, the clinicopathological characteristics 
were compared. There were no significant differences in sex, 
age, smoking habits, drinking habits, family history, diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension between the patients who underwent 
CABG and healthy controls (Table II). RT‑qPCR was used to 
detect miR‑423 expression levels in the plasma of patients with 
CHD (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10). The expression levels 
of miR‑423 in the plasma of patients with CHD were decreased 
compared with the healthy subjects (P<0.001; Fig. 1A). The 
expression levels of plasma miR‑423 in all samples from 
patients with CHD 1 day prior to CABG surgery and 1, 5, 10 
and 20 days following CABG surgery were decreased by the 
10th day following CABG and returned to the preoperative 
levels 20 days after CABG (Fig. 1B). In addition, even the 
maximum expression levels of miR‑423 in patients with CHD
following CABG were decreased compared with those in the 
healthy subjects (P<0.01; Fig. 1C). Therefore, an abnormal 
increase in miR‑423 expression in patients with CHD prior 
to and following CABG may be involved in the protection of 
transplanted blood vessels in surgery, although the mechanism 
remains unclear.
Effect of miR‑423 on the proliferation and migration of 
HUVECs. To further verify the function of miR‑423 in 
patients with CHD following CABG surgery, the effects of 
miR‑423 on the proliferation and migration levels of HUVECs 
were examined using CCK‑8 and Transwell assays. HUVECs 
were transfected with miR‑423 mimics or inhibitor to alter 
the expression of miR‑423. RT‑qPCR analysis indicated 
that, compared with the control group, the expression levels 
of miR‑423 were significantly increased in cells transfected 
with miR‑423 mimics (P<0.001; Fig. 2A) and significantly 
decreased in cells transfected with miR‑423 inhibitor (P<0.01; 
Fig. 2A). The CCK‑8 assay results indicated that the over￾expression of miR‑423 notably promoted cell viability in 
HUVECs at 48 (P<0.05) and 72 h (P<0.01) compared with the 
NC group (Fig. 2B). Data from the Transwell migration assays 
demonstrated that the upregulation of miR‑423 markedly 
increased the migration of HUVECs compared with the NC
group. (P<0.01; Fig. 2C and D), and knockdown of miR‑423 
resulted in the opposite effects on proliferation and migration 
(P<0.01). Taken together, the overexpression of miR‑423 was 
demonstrated to increase the proliferation and migration levels 
of HUVECs.
Effect of miR‑423 on the proliferation and migration of 
HUVSMCs. To investigate the loss‑ and gain‑of‑function of 
miR‑423 in vascular SMCs of vein grafts, miR‑423 mimics or 
inhibitors were transfected into HUVSMCs, and the results are 
presented in Fig. 3A. CCK‑8 and Transwell migration assays 
were used to detect the effects of miR‑423 on the proliferation 
and migration of HUVSMCs. As indicated in Fig. 3B‑D, knock￾down of miR‑423 significantly promoted the proliferation at 48 
(P<0.05) and 72 h (P<0.01; Fig. 3B) and migration capacity of 
HUVSMCs (P<0.01; Fig. 3C and D), whereas overexpression of 
miR‑423 resulted in the opposite effect (P<0.01). These results 
suggest that miR‑423 overexpression significantly inhibited the 
proliferation and migration of HUVSMCs in vitro.
miR‑423 directly targets ADAMTS‑7. TargetScan database 
analysis indicated that miR‑423 may target ADAMTS‑7 
directly (Fig. 4A). To determine whether miR‑423 specifically 
bound to the 3'‑untranslated region of ADAMTS‑7 mRNA 
and regulated the expression of ADAMTS‑7, a dual‑luciferase 
reporter gene assay was used. The results demonstrated that 
luciferase activity in the ADAMTS‑7‑WT + miR‑423 mimics

group was decreased compared with the ADAMTS‑7‑WT 
+ miR‑NC group, but there was no significant differ￾ence between miR‑423 mimics or NC combined with 
ADAMTS‑7‑MUT group (P<0.01; Fig. 4B). Protein expres￾sion levels of ADAMTS‑7 in cells transfected with miR‑423

Additionally, the expression levels of ADAMTS‑7 were signif￾icantly increased in patients with CHD following CABG after 
5 days compared with the healthy subjects (P<0.001; Fig. 4E). 
Spearman's correlation analysis results revealed that there was

CABG after 5 days (r=‑0.685; P<0.01; Fig. 4F). These results 
suggest that ADAMTS‑7 was directly targeted by miR‑423, 
and negatively regulated ADAMTS‑7 expression.
Effect miR‑423/ADAMTS‑7 axis on the proliferation and 
migration of HUVECs and HUVSMCs. The mechanism by 
which miR‑423 modulated cell proliferation and migration 
of HUVECs and HUVSMCs was then assessed. Western blot 
analysis demonstrated that transfection of ADAMTS‑7 was 
successful and protein expression levels were increased, and 
that the increase in expression was reversed in cells co‑trans￾fected with miR‑423 mimics + pcDNA‑ADAMTS‑7 (P<0.01; 
Fig. 5A and B). Compared with the NC group, overexpression 
of ADAMTS‑7 significantly decreased the proliferation and 
migration ability of HUVECs at 48 (P<0.05) and 72 h (P<0.01; 
Fig. 5C and E), but promoted the proliferation and migration of 
HUVSMCs at 48 (P<0.05) and 72 h (P<0.01; Fig. 5D and F). 
The effect of increased ADAMTS‑7 levels on proliferation 
and migration of HUVSMCs or HUVECs was reversed by 
transfection with miR‑423 mimics. These results suggest that 
upregulation of miR‑423 decreases ADAMTS‑7 expression, 
thereby promoting the proliferation and migration of HUVECs 
and decreasing these behaviors in HUVSMCs in vitro.
Effect of miR‑423 upregulated on autologous vein graft restenosis 
in vivo. Based on the effect of miR‑423 on the proliferation and 
migration in HUVSMCs or HUVECs, the function of miR‑423 
in the distension on vein graft restenosis in vivo was determined. 
Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that overexpression of 
miR‑423 markedly decreased neointimal thickness compared 
with the vein graft group (Fig. 6A). However, Masson staining 
results revealed that the percentage of the neointima area occu￾pied by blue‑colored fibers (collagen) was significantly different 
between the miR‑423 agomir‑treated group and the Sham group 
or Vein graft group (Fig. 6B). Immunohistochemistry staining 
demonstrated that increased levels of miR‑423 decreased the 
expression of Ki‑67 in carotid arteries compared with the vein graft 
group (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, western blot analysis was applied 
to detect the effect of miR‑423 overexpression on the prolifera￾tion of vascular SMCs. Upregulation of miR‑423 decreased the 
expression vein graft‑induced ADAMTS‑7, PCNA, MMP2, 
MMP9 and α‑SMA (P<0.01; Fig. 6D). Expression of miR‑423 
was upregulated in the miR‑423 agomir group compared with the 
vein graft group or the Sham group (P<0.001; Fig. 6E). These 
results suggest that overexpression of miR‑423 may attenuate 
autologous vein graft restenosis via targeting ADAMTS‑7 in vivo.
Discussion
CHD is a common disease that affects the quality of life 
patients and causes great economic burden to the patients and 
the whole society (38). In the present study, the role of the 
miR‑423/ADAMTS‑7 axis in the proliferation and migration 
of HUVECs and HUVSMCs in vitro and in vivo was exam￾ined. miR‑423 was downregulated in the plasma of patients 
with CHD compared with healthy volunteers. Upregulation 
of miR‑423 decreased the expression level of ADAMTS‑7, 
resulting in increases in the rates of proliferation and migra￾tion of HUVECs, and accelerated the endothelialization of the 
artificial vessel in vivo. In the past decade, numerous studies

in the field of miRNAs have provided evidence to support the 
role of miRNAs in cardiovascular function and disease, and 
miRNAs have exhibited significant clinical potential (39,40).
The biological behavior of HUVSMCs and HUVECs 
allows them to serve an important role in restenosis and 
long‑term occlusion of vein bridges following coronary 
angioplasty (41‑44). Increasing evidence has indicated that 
the abnormal expression of miRNAs serves an important 
role in transplanted vascular diseases and they have received 
much interest in the research of various diseases (21,45‑47). 
Proliferation, migration and phenotypic transformation of SMCs 
or endothelial cells are associated with various miRNAs (48)

including miR‑145 (49,50), miR‑222 (51), miR‑195 (52) and 
miR‑21 (53). For example, Liu et al (54) confirmed that the 
upregulation of miR‑378a targeted cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 
to promote the proliferation and migration of vascular SMCs 
and increase the incidence of in‑stent restenosis following 
stenting. Huang et al (55) suggested that miR‑22‑3p overex￾pression inhibited proliferation and migration of human artery 
vascular SMCs and prevented neointimal hyperplasia by 
targeting high mobility group box‑1. Endothelial cells‑derived 
miR‑195 significantly suppressed the proliferation and migra￾tion of vascular SMCs (52). Qu et al (56) identified that all 
patients with severe CHD, who were preparing for CABG 
had a significantly decreased level of miR‑126‑3p expression 
compared with the healthy subjects. Taken together, inhibition 
of the biological function of SMCs may be possible using 
specific drugs or biomolecules and this may prevent graft 
vein failure. The results of the present study revealed that 
the expression levels of miR‑423 the plasma of patients with 
CHD were decreased compared with those in the healthy 
subjects, and that upregulation of miR‑423 increased prolif￾eration and migration of HUVECs and had anti‑proliferative 
and anti‑migratory effects on HUVSMCs. This result is in 
agreement with previous studies indicating that the expression 
levels of miRNAs related to the regulation of endothelial cell 
biological behavior and vasculoprotective are significantly 
decreased in patients with stable CHD (57).
Previous studies have demonstrated that ADAMTS‑7 is an 
important member of the depolymerized protein‑like metal￾loproteinase family containing platelet binding protein motifs, 
and its gene polymorphism is significantly associated with 
the susceptibility to human coronary artery disease (30,58). 
Recently, ADAMTS‑7 levels were demonstrated to be asso￾ciated with the severity of disease in patients with CHD or 
saphenous vein grafts restenosis following CABG (59,60). 
Furthermore, abnormally upregulated expression levels of 
ADAMTS‑7 promoted the proliferation and migration of 
vascular SMCs and induced neointima formation in vitro and 
in vivo (29,61). ADAMTS‑7 promoted the proliferation and 
migration of vascular SMCs by decomposing the extracel￾lular matrix, and thereby accelerating intimal hyperplasia, 
resulting in restenosis (62,63). In addition, upregulation of 
ADAMTS‑7 decreased the proliferation and migration of 
endothelial cells and restenosis following vascular injury 
by interrupting the homeostasis between thrombospondin‑1 
and its natural inhibitor cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
(COMP) (31,32). In the present study, overexpression of 
ADAMTS‑7 significantly promoted the proliferation and 
migration of HUVSMCs and induced neointima formation 
following aorta injury. Knockdown of ADAMTS‑7 signifi￾cantly decreased the expression of metalloproteinases such 
as MMP‑2 and MMP‑9. Previous studies have indicated that 
MMPs contributed to the activation of vascular SMCs prolifer￾ation (29,64). Overexpression of ADAMTS‑7 degrades matrix 
COMP in vessels (31), and COMP decreases vascular SMCs 
migration by maintaining them in a quiescent/contractile 
state (65). Based on the results of previous studies, upregula￾tion of ADAMTS‑7 induces neointima formation following 
injury to the aorta through promoting growth and migration of 
vascular SMCs, perhaps as a result of degradation of COMP. 
Furthermore, ADAMTS‑7 was significantly highly expressed 
in the neointima in vein grafts, and the expression level was 
markedly decreased in vein grafts treated with miR‑423 
agomir.
In conclusion, the miR‑423/ADAMTS‑7 axis may be 
involved in regulating the proliferation and migration of 
HUVSMCs and HUVECs in vitro and in vivo, and may serve 
a pivotal role in neointima formation in response to injury. 
The present study may highlight a novel molecular target 
for treating patients with CHD following CABG and new 
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.
