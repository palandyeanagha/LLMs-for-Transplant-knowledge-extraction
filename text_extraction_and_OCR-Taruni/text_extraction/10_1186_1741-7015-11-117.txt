Immunity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease
Johan Frostegård
Abstract
Atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a chronic inflammatory condition with immune
competent cells in lesions producing mainly pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dead cells and oxidized forms of low
density lipoproteins (oxLDL) are abundant. The major direct cause of CVD appears to be rupture of atherosclerotic
plaques. oxLDL has proinflammatory and immune-stimulatory properties, causes cell death at higher concentrations
and contains inflammatory phospholipids with phosphorylcholine (PC) as an interesting epitope. Antibodies against
PC (anti-PC) may be atheroprotective, one mechanism being anti-inflammatory. Bacteria and virus have been
discussed, but it has been difficult to find direct evidence, and antibiotic trials have not been successful. Heat shock
proteins could be one major target for atherogenic immune reactions. More direct causes of plaque rupture
include pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. To prove that inflammation is a cause of
atherosclerosis and CVD, clinical studies with anti-inflammatory and/or immune-modulatory treatment are needed.
The potential causes of immune reactions and inflammation in atherosclerosis and how inflammation can be
targeted therapeutically to provide novel treatments for CVD are reviewed.

Background
Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) including myocardial infarction (MI),
heart failure, stroke and claudication. Atherosclerosis is
mainly located in the intima of many middle sized and
large arteries, especially where the vessels divide. Most
likely this is influenced by the nature of the blood flow,
since areas exposed to normal shear stress seem to be
protected; here endothelial cells express atheroprotective
genes [1]. Also, the adventitia may play a role in athero￾sclerosis development, and is characterized by lympho￾cyte infiltrates [2].
Activated endothelium with expression of adhesion mol￾ecules appears to be an early event in atherosclerosis,
allowing mononuclear leukocytes, such as monocytes and
T-cells, to attach to the endothelium and penetrate into
the intima. Though not as common as these cells, dendritic
cells, mast cells and a few neutrophils and B-cells may also
be present in lesions. Another cell type which is present in
lesions is smooth muscle cells (SMC) which change pheno￾type into synthetic SMC and migrate into the intima from
the media. The notion of atherosclerosis as an inflamma￾tory disease is based on the finding that immune compe￾tent cells are abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, and also
are producing cytokines, especially proinflammatory cyto￾kines [3].
The role of immunity, as defined by the role of activated
T-cells and B-cells, in atherosclerosis is much less known,
especially in humans, although novel data indicate that
underlying immunological factors predispose to inflamma￾tion in humans and that immune modulation altering ath￾erosclerosis is possible in animal models, especially mice
[4]. It is, therefore, important to discuss inflammation in
atherosclerosis in the same context as immunity.
Even though atherosclerosis per se could decrease
blood flow through stenosis and thus induce CVD, the
major mechanism appears to be atherothrombosis,
usually when plaques are damaged through the effects
of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on the
fibrous cap. When plaques are damaged and rupture,

prothrombotic material is exposed to the coagulation
system, with ensuing inhibition of blood flow and thus
induction of CVD. The major risk factors which can be
modified for atherosclerosis (and CVD) are hyperten￾sion, smoking, diabetes and dyslipidemia. In addition,
age and male sex are of major importance [4].
Potential causes of inflammation and immune reactions
in atherogenesis and plaque complications
Even though both genetic and epigenetic factors influence
atherogenesis and risk of CVD, this review is focused on
what is perceived as the major potential direct causes of
the inflammation and immune reactions in this context.
Oxidized LDL and related compounds
Low density lipoprotein modified by oxidation or en￾zymatic modification (OxLDL) is present at an early
stage. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) penetrates into the
intima at the earliest stages of atherosclerosis and binds to
the proteoglycan matrix, enabling further modification
through oxidation and/or enzymatic modification (OxLDL).
Also at later stages, oxLDL and related compounds are
ubiquitous in lesions [5,6]. Therefore, oxLDL could play a
role both in atherogenesis and in plaque complications.
OxLDL is immunogenic and activates endothelial cells,
monocytes/macrophages and T cells [7-9]. Further, oxLDL
is toxic at higher concentrations and could thus be a cause
of cell death in lesions [7-9]. Enzymatically modified LDL
could play a major role, and phospholipase 2 (PLA2), which
causes such modification, is expressed in both normal
arteries and atherosclerotic lesions [10] and can induce
activation of dendritic cells [11]. The proinflammatory and
immune stimulatory effects of oxLDL are mimicked by in￾flammatory phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC), which is a major phospholipid in atherosclerotic
lesions [12,13]. Other proinflammatory phospholipids
implicated in oxLDL, such as LPC, have phosphorylcholine
(PC) as an important epitope, which cause these different
phospholipids, to different degrees, to interact with the
platelet activating factor (PAF)-receptor, which is one
mechanism by which oxLDL exerts its effects [14,15].
Other mechanisms include interaction with Toll-like re￾ceptors and scavenger receptors [16,17].
Not only oxidized and/or enzymatically modified
phospholipids are implicated as causes of oxLDL’s pro￾atherogenic and pro-inflammatory effects; there are
several other possibilities. It has even been suggested
that epitopes, such as those exposed during LDL￾modification and/or oxidation, represent an evolution￾ary conserved system of danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMP) in parallell with pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMP) [17]. One important ex￾ample of DAMP in addition to phospholipid (PL)-re￾lated epitopes, such as PC, is malondialdehyde (MDA)
which is generated during oxidation of LDL. MDA
forms adducts on proteins and peptides, carbohydrates
and DNA [17].
Modified and oxidized apolipoprotein B (apoB) and
cholesterol could also be implicated [17] although
putative mechanisms are not as well described as for
PC-exposing epitopes.
While much evidence from epidemiological studies
indicates that smoking is associated with atherosclerosis
and CVD [18,19], the exact mechanisms by which smok￾ing could cause inflammation in the arteries are not fully
elucidated, although increased oxidation of lipids is one
interesting possibility [20]. Interestingly, smoking is as￾sociated with increased lipid oxidation [20]. Different
animal models of smoking and atherosclerosis indicate
that smoking promotes atherogenesis [21-23], and one
underlying mechanism is reported to be oxidative
stress [24].
In support of inflammatory phospholipids as causes of
atherosclerosis are data from clinical studies, where we
reported that in conditions with increased atheroslerosis,
such as hypertension and systemic lupus erythmatosus
(SLE), PC-exposing LDL is increased [25].
Oxidation of LDL, and also increased oxidative stress
in diabetes, could promote atherogenesis [26]. Forma￾tion of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) could
contribute to atherosclerosis (and CVD) in diabetes
since AGEs have proinflammatory and potentially
atherogenic properties [27-29].
Dead cells
The role of cell death as a cause of inflammation in
atherosclerosis and plaque rupture is complicated and
depends most likely on stage of disease, and naturally,
on whether cell death is organized as in apoptosis, or
not, as in necrosis. It is likely that a defective apoptotic
clearance and ensuing necrosis could contribute to
inflammation.
Dying cells can activate the innate immune system
and induce an inflammatory response with release of
the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, activating the
inflammasome [30].
According to the danger hypothesis, endogenous
factors (DAMPs) released during cell death induce in￾flammation. DAMPs include high-mobility group pro￾tein B1 (HMGB-1), double-stranded DNA, amyloid-β
-peptide and heat-shock proteins (HSP) [31]. Even
though cell death is not an early event in atherogenesis
(fatty streak formation and infiltration of monocytes/
macrphages and T cells apparently come first), it could
play a role at a later stage to promote inflammation.
Whether it plays a role in plaque rupture is possible
but not proved.

Phospholipid-related epitopes
Antibodies against phospholipids (aPL), especially
against cardiolipin (aCL) are well known to be associated
with CVD, especially in SLE patients but it has been dif￾ficult to find unequivocal evidence of aPL as athero￾genic, and there are both negative and positive reports
[25]. In a recent study, we did not find an association
between aPL and prevalence of atheroslerotic plaques in
patients with SLE [32]. Typical of pathogenic aPL is that
they are dependent on plasma co-factors, such as beta2-
glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) , to promote CVD. Mecha￾nisms could include a direct effect on endothelium and
also interference with anti-coagulant proteins such as
Annexin A5 [32,33].
CL has a unique double structure, with four fatty acid
chains and is present in bacteria and the inner mito￾chondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells [34], which is in￾teresting since mitochondria apparently have a bacterial
origin [35]. In contrast to aCL, we recently reported that
antibodies against oxidized forms of CL (aOxCL) are
negatively associated with CVD, low levels giving high
risk and high levels low risk [36]. In contrast to aCL,
aOxCL are not beta2GPI-dependent [36]. One mechan￾ism could be inhibition of binding and uptake of oxLDL
in macrophages [36]. Further, aOxCL and also antibodies
against oxidized phosphatidylserine (aOxPS) are nega￾tively associated with atherosclerosis development (un￾published data).
Another example of natural antibodies is those against
PC (anti-PC). Several lines of evidence imply that anti￾PC could play a role in atherogenesis, both from animal
studies, other experimental studies and from clinical co￾hort studies [37]. Immunization in a mouse model with
pneumococcae caused a decrease in atherosclerosis de￾velopment in parallell with an increase in anti-PC levels,
among other antibodies [38]. Both passive and active
immunization with PC ameliorates atherosclerosis in
mouse models [39,40]. We have reported in several pa￾pers that immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-PC is negatively
associated with atherosclerosis development and risk of
CVD. Typically, low levels give rise to increased risk
and, in some cases, high levels were also associated with
decreased risk [37]. We reported for the first time that
anti-PC is a protective marker for atherosclerosis devel￾opment in humans which was also the case with anti￾bodies against malone dialdehyde LDL (anti-MDALDL)
and anti-OxLDL [41].
Mechanisms by which human anti-PC could amelior￾ate atherosclerosis and CVD include: anti-inflammatory
effects, inhibition of pro-inflammatory effects by inflam￾matory phospholipids [42], inhibition of uptake of
oxLDL through scavenger receptors [43] and inhibition
of cell death induced by LPC, a major inflammatory
phospholipid [44]. In another paper, the inflammatory
effect of anti-PC is also confirmed in a mouse model, in
which facilitating phagocytosis is described as one mech￾anism. It is possible that natural IgM, such as anti-PC,
could counter atherosclerosis development by binding to
dead and dying cells in the lesions, increasing phagocyt￾osis and clearance of obnoxious pro-inflammatory com￾pounds [45].
Low levels of anti-PC could thus be a cause of the in￾flammation in atherosclerosis, although it is less clear by
what mechanisms. We have suggested that a Western
life style could contribute, and one underlying factor
could be some types of infections which are not preva￾lent in the West which could raise anti-PC [46]; another
could be factors which are relatively new from an evolu￾tionary point of view such as gluten [47]. Genetic factors
could also play a role in addition to environmental influ￾ences since heritability of anti-PC is 37% [48].
Heat shock proteins
HSPs, especially HSP60 but potentially also other ones,
such as HSP70 and HSP90, represent another interesting
potential cause of inflammation in atherosclerosis. This
could be of great interest since HSPs are immunogenic
and T-cell clones recognizing HSP60 are present in both
early and late atherosclerotic plaques [49,50]. HSPs may
also activate immune reactions through cross-reactivity
with HSP from microorganisms, such as bacteria. This
notion is supported by both clinical data with associa￾tions between antibodies against HSP60/65 and athero￾sclerosis, and experimental data where immunization
with HSP60/65 aggravates atherosclerosis [51,52].
HSPs could promote inflammation by other mecha￾nisms as well. Besides being specific T-cell antigens per
se, present on antigen presenting cells, HSP and/or pep￾tides thereof could promote immune activation by other
mechanisms. HSPs are chaperones and can form im￾mune complexes with other antigens including tumor￾derived ones, and these can be presented through class I
or class II antigen presenting pathways [53]. HSP can be
passively released which may occur in cell necrosis but
also actively through exosomes. HSPs could thus play a
role in the extracellular space where they could be en￾dogenous ligands, activating the innate immune system,
through Toll-like receptors or by association with endo￾toxin [54]. The mechanisms by which hypertension could
cause inflammation in the artery wall are not clear. One
possibility is a direct effect on the endothelium, which
could become dysfunctional as a response to injury leading
to proinflammatory changes [55]. We suggested in previous
studies that hypertension could cause inflammation by
induction of immunogenic HSP60/65, which is also in￾duced by oxLDL [56,57]. We reported that HSP70 is a pro￾tective factor for development of atherosclerosis among

hypertensives, but a putative underlying mechanism is not
clear [58].
Infections
Infections have been much discussed as potential causes
of immune activation and inflammation in atheroscler￾osis. In early studies, before the rise of the lipid hypoth￾esis, pathologists and others who observed the lesions
thought they could be of infectious origin based on the
microscopic and macroscopic features of atherosclerosis.
Among the most promising candidates that are
present in plaques, promote atherosclerosis in animal
studies and have associations with disease in humans
are Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), periodontal organisms in￾cluding Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans (AA), Helicobacter pylori (HP) and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) [59].
One important starting point underlying the hypotehsis
that infections play a role in atherosclerosis was early stud￾ies of CP, demonstrating the presence of this pathogen in
atherosclerotic plaques [60] and an association between
cardiovascular and antibody titer [61-63] by P Saikku and
coworkers and others. As is the case with other pathogens,
also discussed, such as CMV, there are also studies in which
no such associations were demonstrated [59].
A more formal test of the hypothesis has been done
with treatment with antibiotics which have an effect on
CP. However, four large studies were not positive and
did not support the notion of a causative effect of CP on
CVD [64-66]. However, there could be other reasons for
the negative results. One is that chronic CP may be diffi￾cult to treat irrespective of CVD; another is that the
treatment trials have been performed on patients with
late stage disease, and it is possible that earlier stages
would be more responsive [59].
Periodontal microorganisms, such as PG and AA, are
also interesting candidates. Even though clinical/epi￾demiological studies show associations, there are many
confounding factors which are difficult to control for,
maybe more for these agents than is the case with other
pathogens in this context. A recent scientific statement
from the American Heart Association supports an inde￾pendent association between periodontal disease but
available data do not support causation, although inter￾vention does decrease systemic inflammation and im￾proves endothelial function [67].
CMV belongs to the Herpes virus group which is very
common in the general population; this makes studies of
associations difficult to interpret. There are interesting
reports of an association between active CMV infection
and transplant complications including vasculopathy
[68]. A causal relationship between CMV infection and
transplant vascular complications seems to be more
plausible than associations with atherosclerosis per se.
CMV is reported to be present in atherosclerotic lesions
in many but not all studies [59]. Of note, CMV has also
been documented in healthy arteries [69] which could
also be taken as an indication that CMV may be an in￾nocent by-stander. On the other hand, there are interest￾ing properties in CMV which could make it a plausible
candidate to be a contributing factor in atherosclerosis.
For example, CMV infection induces migration of arter￾ial smooth muscle cells [70].
HP, a well known cause of gastritis and gastric ulcer,
may also be implicated in CVD and atherosclerosis, al￾though animal experiments are less clear than is the case
with CP. Viable bacteria have not been unequivocally
demonstrated from lesions. However, there are positive
reports of a reduction of CVD after eradication of HP.
HP does not promote a local inflammatory reaction to
the same extent as do CP, CMV and several other impli￾cated pathogens [59]. Of note, viable HP have not been
isolated from atherosclerotic plaques, and mouse experi￾ments have not given any clear indication that HP is a
cause of atherosclerosis [71].
Interestingly, treatment regimens for both CP and HP
had a positive effect on clinical CVD events [72]. How￾ever, as discussed, larger studies for CP were not suc￾cessful and are needed also for HP.
Other infectious agents that have been discussed and
reported as potential causes of CVD and atherosclerosis
include HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza, Myco￾plasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Another interesting case, in which there is evidence
from human studies, is Borrelia [73], although experi￾mental data or plaque data are not available to the best
of my knowledge. However these appear to be less
supported by evidence; especially, there is no convincing
data from human studies [59].
Taken together, even though the infectious hypothesis
in CVD and atherosclerosis has been studied for some
decades, there is still little direct, though rather much
circumstantial, evidence of a causative role of infectious
agents.
Another interesting development, in which infections
and atherosclerosis/CVD could be related in a more indir￾ect way, is recent findings implicating the intestinal bacter￾ial flora [74,75]. Intestinal microbiota metabolism of
choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine
(TMA), which is metabolized to proatherogenic trimeth￾ylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Recently, it was demonstrated
that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary l￾carnitine in red meat produces TMAO and accelerates
atherosclerosis in mice. This finding suggests another inter￾esting link between gut flora and atherosclerosis [76].
Another aspect of immunity and inflammation that
could be relevant for atherosclerosis is modulation of
the host by microorganisms in order to promote their
Frostegård BMC Medicine 2013, 11:117 Page 4 of 13

own survival. PC has a central role, being exposed on
different types of pathogens including Gram-positive
and –negative bacteria, nematodes and protozoa. In this
context, the pathogens use PC to create a favorable en￾vironment for themselves in the host. One interesting
possibility is therefore that PC exposed in the athero￾sclerotic plaque in fact modulates the local immune re￾action into an unresolved chronic inflammation, in a
similar manner as PC-exposing pathogens do in chronic
infections [77].
Further research is needed to clarify if the described
associations are causative in humans.
Other types of inflammation having a potentially causative
role in atherogenesis
Even though it remains to be demonstrated that infec￾tions play a direct role in atherogenesis, they could still
be of great importance indirectly. By being present in le￾sions, they could stimulate an ongoing inflammatory
process, which in the long run may lead to increased
atherosclerosis and ensuing CVD. Further, it is possible
that the total infectious burden could be a risk factor for
increased atherosclerosis and CVD, possibly through
promotion of systemic inflammation, platelet aggrega￾tion and endothelial dysfunction, which in turn could
influence atherogenesis [59,78].
Raised levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) have been
implicated as a risk marker for atherosclerosis and CVD
in many studies, although it is not clear if CRP could
play a causative role. Also, cytokines, such as IL-6, raised
systemic levels of oxLDL and have been implicated in
many studies [4]. Another example of an interesting
group of inflammatory compounds is lipid mediators,
such as leukotrienes, which are present in advanced
atherosclerotic plaques [79,80].
Another interesting example of indirect effects by
other types of inflammation is the relationship between
chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and ath￾erosclerosis (and CVD). Here the evidence is strongest
for the prototypic autoimmune disease SLE where the
risk of CVD is very high. According to one report the
risk increased 50 times [81] and several other studies
have also reported a high risk (although from low levels
since young and middle aged women without SLE (or
familial hyperlipidemia) very seldom develop CVD, and,
even less, advanced atherosclerosis [25]. Also in rheuma￾toid arthritis (RA), an increased prevalence of athero￾sclerosis has been reported, although the evidence
appears less clear than in SLE. In other rheumatic
diseases, an increasing number of papers indicate an
increased atherogenesis [25]; which is confirmed in a
recent meta-analysis which demonstrates that rheumatic
diseases increase the risk of atherosclerosis [82].
It is interesting to note that this discussion is not new.
Already in the first half of the 19th century, the legend￾ary pathologists Rokitansky and Virchow (the former as
the first) reported that atherosclerosis is an inflamma￾tory process although their opinions differed somewhat,
since Rokitansky thought inflammation in atheroscler￾osis was a secondary phenomenon, but Virchow pro￾posed it was a primary factor [83]. Non-traditional risk
markers, such as low anti-PC and inflammation per se
appear to play a role, in addition to traditional ones,
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and to a varying
degree, smoking [25].
Although opinions may differ somewhat as to what
comes first in the development of atherosclerosis, it ap￾pears likely that different factors could act in concert. It
is also possible that there are differences between differ￾ent individuals, where some may have atherosclerosis
with more inflammation than others. It is also possible
that infection could play an important role among sub￾groups of individuals and patients.
Recently, new aspects of immune mechanisms in ath￾erosclerosis have been discussed in addition to intimal
immune reactions which have been in focus. Even
though the adventitial inflammation in atherosclerosis
was noted already by Virchow and Rokitansky [83], and
cellular immune infiltrates were described in the early
1960s [84], this phenomenon has only recently been
more thoroughly studied [2,85]. The adventitia appears
to be more complex than the intima and media also in
normal arteries. Many cell types, including fibroblasts,
dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells and
T-cells are present. There are also nerve endings, small
vessels (vasa vasorum), endothelial protenitor cells and
the like in the intima, a matrix [86].
Data from mouse models of atherosclerosis are interest￾ing, with B cells and T cells present in the adventitia
forming inflammatory follicle-like structures [87]. An im￾portant role played by adventitial lymphocytes is suggested
by several studies [2]. For example, proinflammatory IL￾17A–producing T cells are present in the adventitia. Block￾ade of IL-17A led to a reduction in aortic macrophage
accumulation and atherosclerosis [88].
Less is known about the role of the adventitia in human
atherosclerosis,although immune competent cells includ￾ing T cells and B cells are present in adventitial lymphoid
follicles both in the aorta and in coronary arteries [2].
One important question is how the adventitia interacts
with the intima in atherosclerotic lesions. It is interesting
to note that B-cells are not common in the intima, as
compared to findings from adventitia in atherosclerotic
lesions. The role of B-cells in atherosclerosis most likely
depends on subsets, at least according to studies in
mouse models, with B2 lymphocytes being atherogenic
and B1 lymphocytes protective against atherosclerosis [2].

Another factor in CVD, plaque rupture and late stage
atherosclerosis may be intimal hemorrhage. Erythrocyte
membranes are abundant in late stage lesions and could
be a proinflammatory factor, increasing the risk of
plaque rupture [89,90].
Atherosclerosis and immunosenescence
An interesting question is whether atherosclerosis should
be seen as a normal part of human aging or as a patho￾logical process which could be, if not abolished, at least
strongly reduced. Risk factors which cannot be modified in￾clude age and male sex, as opposed to those which can be
favorably modified, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia,
diabetes and smoking. One way to gain further insight into
this intriguing question is to study atherosclerosis and
CVD in populations living a life closer to the conditions
during which humanity evolved. Further, studies of animals
could provide important information.
The presence of atherosclerotic lesions in ancient
Egyptian mummies was described more than 100 years
ago and the findings were confirmed and extended in re￾cent years; similar findings have been obtained in mum￾mified bodies from other cultures as well [91]. It appears
that these findings are clearer among wealthy individuals
and, interestingly, were present at a relatively early age,
since many of the mummies have been in their 40s and
50s when they died.
The famous ‘iceman’ (‘Ötzi’) found in South Tyrol in
the early 1990s is of more interest as compared to the
above-mentioned mummies. He died after being shot by
an arrow, causing internal bleeding, 5,300 years ago in
the Alps. Ötzi had atherosclerosis as determined by ar￾terial calcifications [92]. His last meals consisted of meat
(apparently from red deer and ibex) but also cereals [93].
Further, he seems to have been only approximately 45
years old when killed. Ötzi had signs of infection with
Borrelia, which has been linked to atherosclerosis [73].
In a recent study his genome has been sequenced, and
among other surprising findings is that he had a genetic
predisposition for atherosclerosis [94].
A recent study of mummies from different geographic
origins lends support to the notion that atherosclerosis
was present among individuals in Stone Age cultures;
for example, three of five hunter-gatherers had athero￾sclerosis [95]. It thus appears that atherosclerosis per se
is not caused by a modern life-style, but is a part of
human senescence. It is, therefore, interesting to study if
the same applies to plaque rupture and CVD.
In Kitava, where New Guineans live a traditional life
as horticulturalists, CVD and other conditions, such as
Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatic disease, appear to be
very rare. This is not likely to be explained simply by a
low life expectancy allowing too little time for these con￾ditions to become manifest [96,97]. The risk factor
profile was favorable as compared to Westerners, with
good metabolic control, lack of hypertension, somewhat
but not strikingly better lipid profile and higher levels of
anti-inflammatory natural anti-PC which appear to have
anti-atherosclerotic properties. We also reported on
infections studied in this population and suggested that
infection with treponema is associated with the presence
of atheroprotective anti-PC. It is possible that a low
exposure in the West to such pathogens could contrib￾ute to low anti-PC levels, predisposing to western
chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis
[46]. Of note, treponema infections most likely have
been with humanity since hominid times and, interest￾ingly, anti-PC appears to play an important role in
protection against this type of infection [98].
In our study on individuals from Kitava (New Guinea),
the age span was between 40 and 86, with a mean age of
59.0, and here, traditional risk factors (except smoking!)
were very favorable among Kitavans. This study lends sup￾port to the notion that CVD and, thus, plaque rupture is
prevalent in modern societies. Further, immunosenescence
may play an important role, since anti-PC decreased with
age among Swedish controls, which was not the case with
Kitavans [97].
A recent study of hunter-gatherers (pygmies living in the
Cameroon forest) demonstrated lower aortic stiffness in
this group [99], lending support to an atheroprotective role
of the hunter-gatherer life style.
Still, it cannot be ruled out that low life expectancy
among hunter-gatherers ‘masks’ CVD caused by athero￾sclerosis, although available evidence argues against this
being an important factor, including an apparent lack of
major risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes.
While mortality throughout life apparently is very high
among hunter-gatherers, from causes such as violence
and wars, accidents and infection, some also reached a
high age [100].
Taken together, human studies indicate that athero￾sclerosis and its complications do not have to be a prob￾lem in normal aging up to high age, which would be a
hopeful notion, implying that the disease at least could
be postponed. Maybe such ‘natural’ atherosclerosis could
be compared to cancer of the prostate, where many eld￾erly men have signs of this disease, but will die from
other causes.
It is interesting to note, that among wild animals, ath￾erosclerosis has been described in elephants, which have
a similar life span as humans and naturally large arteries.
In one very interesting and unique study, almost 500
elephants were studied directly after death. The animals
were randomly culled from free-living populations in
East Africa as part of a program to decrease the elephant
population to avoid starvation among these animals
due to expansion of human agricultural activities. The
Frostegård BMC Medicine 2013, 11:117 Page 6 of 13

elephant is interesting in this context, since its life span
is similar to man. The study found atherosclerosis to be
common, with necrosis, lipid accumulation, lymphocytic
infiltration and calcification. Interestingly, there were no
signs of mural thrombosis or plaque hemorrhage (even
with lymphocytic infiltration) [101]. However, the degree
to which CVD is a cause of death in elephants is not
known.
Anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory treatment
against atherosclerosis and CVD
Even though the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis
and, thus, CVD has been known for a long time, there is
no anti-inflammatory or immune modulatory treatment
available to ameliorate these diseases. Further, to the
best of my knowledge, there are no published convincing
studies that such therapies work in humans. Here, I will
discuss some immune-modulatory therapies that have
potential against atherosclerosis.
Statins
Interestingly, statins, one of the most successful medi￾cines in history from a commercial point of view, and
clearly representing also a therapeutic improvement,
may work to an unknown extent due to their pleiotropic,
especially anti-inflammatory, properties. This effect is a
‘side-effect’ of these inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase,
influencing prenylation as one mechanism. Further, the
immunomodulatory effects of statins, directly interfering
with major histocompatibility complex MHC class II
presentation, have been described [102]. Interestingly,
statins have been reported to be beneficial in RA;
other anti-inflammatory mechanisms could be decreas￾ing LDL-oxidation, and immune modulatory effects, de￾creasing MHC class II interaction with antigen [103]. In
line with this, the Jupiter study demonstrated that statin
treatment may be beneficial for individuals with raised
high sensitivity CRP but normal LDL [104]. In a recent
review by Ridker, it is stated that: ‘it is impossible in any
statin trial to establish whether the clinical benefits of
treatment are due to LDL-reduction alone, to inflamma￾tion inhibition, or to a combination of both processes’
[105]. It is striking that the possibility is raised that a
novel and successful therapy developed to decrease
cholesterol and specifically LDL, may work partly or
even only, by another mechanism, namely inhibition of
inflammation.
Anti-inflammatory treatment
Other interesting potential therapies include both unspe￾cific and specific approaches. In RA, treatment with
methotrexate weekly is routinely used, with beneficial ef￾fects on patients. A recent meta-analysis indicates that
the risk of CVD is decreased in patients with RA treated
with methotrexate [106]. Animal studies in which
methotrexate decreases atherogenesis add support to
methotrexate as a possible anti-inflammatory therapy
in CVD [107]. In the Cardiovascular Inflammation
Reduction Trial (CIRT) low dose methotrexate (target
dose 20 mg/week) is tested for reduction of major
CVD events among post-myocardial infarction patients
with diabetes or metabolic syndrome [104].
Initially in RA, treatment with biologics, such as
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors, has proven to be
successful, and novel biologics also include inhibitors of
other cytokines. However, there are different opinions as
to whether biologics, such as anti-TNF, are beneficial
from a cardiovascular point of view, although a recent
study in which there was a decrease of CVD in RA adds
support to this possibility [108,109].
The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Out￾comes Study (CANTOS) investigates if IL-1β inhibition
could reduce the risk of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular
death among stable coronary artery disease patients with
high risk of CVD due to persistent elevations of CRP
(≥2 mg/L) [105,110].
Other potentially interesting treatment moieties in￾clude inhibition of inflammatory lipid mediators, such as
PAF [111]. We recently reported that Annexin A5, an
anti-thrombotic plasma protein, is anti-inflammatory
and inhibits atherosclerosis development and also im￾proves endothelial function in a mouse model. Annexin
A5 could thus represent another possible therapy [112].
Likewise, inhibition of PLs, such as lipoprotein associ￾ated PLA2, is of interest. Studies of the inhibition of
Lp-PLA(2) activity with darapladib in patients after an
acute coronary syndrome are under way [113].
Immune modulatory therapy
One example of possible immune modulatory, and thus
potential anti-inflammatory, treatment against athero￾sclerosis and/or CVD is immune therapy against epitopes
from oxLDL. In the mid-1990s, it was demonstrated that
immunization with modified forms of LDL ameliorated
atherosclerosis [114], which showed for the first time the
possibility of inhibition of atherosclerosis development
by immunization.
As discussed, during LDL-oxidation, various chemical
moieties are formed, including both fragmented apoB and
oxidized phospholipids. One approach is to target the apoB
component. Peptides from apoB with promising immuno￾modulatory properties have been demonstrated to decrease
atherosclerosis development in animal models [115-117].
However, a recent clinical study did not show any
positive effect in humans [118]. The primary endpoint
was the relative change in inflammatory activity in an
index arterial vessel after twelve weeks, as measured
by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/
Frostegård BMC Medicine 2013, 11:117 Page 7 of 13

computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging. Fur￾ther studies with other end points and using other,
perhaps more established, techniques could clarify if
this approach could still be promising in humans.
Another line of research and potential treatment is
based on the phospholipid moiety as a target for treat￾ment with monoclonal antibodies, specifically PC. As
discussed above, this notion is supported by cohort stud￾ies, animal and in vitro experiments [37,39,40,42-44].
Mechanisms include anti-inflammatory [42,119], inhib￾ition of cell death [44] and decreased uptake of oxLDL
in macrophages [43].
A more unspecific method of immunomodulation is
administration of Igs. This approach has shown promis￾ing results in animal studies with human Ig from pools
of many donors, such as used in intravenous Ig treat￾ment (IVIG) [120].
Yet another interesting possibility is to ameliorate ath￾erosclerosis by immunomodulation with HSP. To the
best of my knowledge, HSP-immunization demonstrated
for the first time that atherosclerosis can be influenced
by immunization. In a study using a rabbit model, such
therapy increased atherosclerosis development [51].
Interestingly, nasal immunization with HSP65 led to in￾duction of immune tolerance in a rabbit model, suggesting
that immunization mucosally with Hsp65 protein could be
a promising therapeutic method for atherosclerosis [121].
In another experiment, a vaccine was designed to tar￾get both HSP65 and cholesteryl ester transfer protein
(CETP) in order to obtain both a positive effect on the
immune reactions relevant in atherosclerosis and on
blood lipids. Here, also, nasal immunization ameliorated
atherosclerosis in a rabbit model [122].
There are also conflicting data. In a recent study,
subcutaneous immunization with HSP-65 in apoE—mice
actually reduced atherosclerosis [123]. Further, in another
interesting study immunization with human HSP60 (with
or without combination with apoB peptides) led to
decreased atherosclerosis [124]. It is thus presently not
clear how HSP-immunization could work as therapy
against atherosclerosis development even in animal models.
It is possible that differences in modes of presentation
of the antigen could play a role. The potential anti￾inflammatory treatments for atherosclerosis are sum￾marized in Table 1.
Summary and conclusions
Taken together, atherosclerosis is the major underlying
cause of CVD, which in turn is the major cause of death,
at least in the developed world, and also an important
cause of morbidity worldwide. During recent years, it
has become clear that atherosclerosis is a chronic
inflammation in large and middle-sized arteries, where
activated immune competent cells are abundant. Inflam￾mation could play a major role to trigger plaque rupture
which is the immediate cause of CVD. Oxidized and/or
modified forms of LDL, infections, HSPs and a more
unspecific systemic inflammation are examples of hy￾potheses of underlying causes of the inflammation in
atherosclerosis. Studies of anti-inflammatory and im￾mune modulatory treatment are underway or discussed.
Until such treatment studies in humans demonstrate
that atherosclerosis is ameliorated, the causative role of
inflammation in atherosclerosis remains a hypothesis.
The atherosclerotic lesion and potential causes of
inflammation and immune reactions there are shown in
Figure 1.
The normal artery has three parts or layers: 1) The
tunica intima which is lined with endothelial cells in
contact with the blood stream and also, in humans,
containing some SMC. 2) The media which contains
SMC and extracellular matrix. 3) The adventitia which
appears to be more complex than the other two layers,
although the exact role of the adventitia in atheroscler￾osis is not known. Many cell types, including fibroblasts,
dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells and
T-cells are present. There are also nerve endings, small
vessels (vasa vasorum), endothelial protenitor cells, and
a matrix.
During atherosclerosis development early steps include
activation of the monolayer of the endothelial cells with
expression of adhesion molecules and migration of
blood monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells
and some B-cells into the intima, and also adhesion of
modified forms of LDL to matrix components. Mono￾cytes/macrophages are especially numerous and develop

into foam cells, filled mainly with modified LDL. Medial
SMC migrate into the intima and develop a more syn￾thetic phenotype, producing matrix components. As the
atherosclerotic plaque grows, a fibrous cap is developed
to cover it. Later on, dying and dead cells accumulate,
many of which are derived from foam cells. With further
advancement, microvessels develop in the plaque. A
feared complication of atherosclerosis, which by itself
can be seen as a part of normal aging, is fracture and/or
rupture of the fibrous cap, leading to contact between
the blood coagulation components and plaque material
including tissue factor, which triggers thrombosis, lead￾ing to infarction.
The cause of the inflammation and ensuing plaque
rupture has not been clarified, although non-mutually
exclusive possibilities exist. OxLDL as opposed to LDL,
activate T-cells, and stimulate monocyte/macrophages
and other cell types of the plaque. Part of this effect is
likely mediated by inflammatory phospholipids. Natural
anti-PC and other phospholipids could be protective by
neutralizing the inflammatory effects, and low levels of
these could be a cause of inflammation.
HSPs induced in the plaque by stress, oxLDL and
other factors could become immunogenic, and trigger
immune responses which could both induce and po￾tentiate inflammation in atherosclerosis. Infections have
been much discussed, and many infectious agents are
present in lesions. Even though they potentially could be
a cause of atherosclerosis, this is not supported fully by
available evidence, and they could also be innocent
bystanders. As a proximate cause of plaque rupture,
cytokines and chemokines could play a major direct role,
induced by other factors.
