Abstract
Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of inherited
kidney disease that results in renal failure. ADPKD is a systemic disorder with cysts and connective tissue
abnormalities involving many organs. ADPKD caused by mutations in PKD1 gene is significantly more severe than
the cases caused by PKD2 gene mutations. The large intra-familial variability of ADPKD highlights a role for genetic
background.
Case presentation: Here we report a case of ADPKD family initially appearing unlinked to the PKD1 or PKD2 loci
and the influence of mosaicism and hypomorphic allele on the variability of the clinical course of the disease. A
grandmother with the PKD1 gene mutation in mosaicism (p.Val1105ArgfsX4) and with mild clinical course of
ADPKD (end stage renal failure at the age of 77) seemed to have ADPKD because of PKD2 gene mutation. On the
other hand, her grandson had a severe clinical course (end stage renal disease at the age of 45) in spite of the early
treatment of mild hypertension. There was found by mutational analysis of PKD genes that the severe clinical
course was caused by PKD1 gene frameshifting mutation inherited from his father and mildly affected grandmother
in combination with inherited hypomorphic PKD1 allele with described missense mutation (p.Thr2250Met) from his
clinically healthy mother. The sister with two cysts and with PKD1 hypomorphic allele became the kidney donor to
her severely affected brother.
Conclusion: We present the first case of ADPKD with the influence of mosaicism and hypomorphic allele of the
PKD1 gene on clinical course of ADPKD in one family. Moreover, this report illustrates the role of molecular genetic
testing in assessing young related kidney donors for patients with ADPKD.

Background
ADPKD is the most frequently inherited renal cystic dis￾order with an incidence between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1000.
ADPKD is a systemic disorder with cysts and connective
tissue abnormalities involving many organs. The pro￾gressive formation and enlargement of renal cysts causes
the decline in renal function. The disease is genetically
heterogeneous. Mutation either in the PKD1 (approxi￾mately 85% of patients) or PKD2 gene (approximately
15%) cause ADPKD, with an average age of 54.3 and
74 years, respectively, at the onset of ESRD (end stage
renal disease) [1]. The greater severity of PKD1 muta￾tions is due to the development of more cysts at an early
age, not to faster cyst growth [2]. So far, 869 different
sequence variants have been reported in Polycystic Kid￾ney Disease Mutation Database (PKDB) in the PKD1
gene and 128 different sequence variants in the PKD2
gene. Patients with mutations in the 50 region of PKD1
gene (until nucleotide 7812) manifest more severe dis￾ease (only 18.9% still have with adequate renal function
at the age of 60 and are more likely to have intracranial
aneurysms than patients with 30 mutations (39.7% of
whom still have adequate renal function at 60 years of
age) [3]. No clear correlations were found with mutation
type in both PKD genes or with mutation position in

PKD2 gene. The large intra-familial variability of ADPKD
highlights a role for genetic background. Coinheritance of
a PKD1 hypomorphic allele in combination with an inacti￾vating PKD1 allele can lead to early manifestation of
ADPKD [4,5]. Mosaicism can also modulate the clinical
course of the disease [6,7].
Our case illustrates ADPKD initially appearing un￾linked to the PKD1 or PKD2 loci and the influence of
mosaicism and hypomorphic allele in trans position on
the prognosis of the disease in one family. The difficul￾ties encountered in excluding ADPKD in related poten￾tial kidney donors are also mentioned.
Case presentation
A 45-year-old white male was examined before related
preemptive renal transplantation. The patient was regu￾larly examined by ultrasound because of positive family
history of ADPKD. His 69-year-old father had ESRD at
52 years because of polycystic kidneys. Father had not
well compensated hypertension many years. His grand￾mother with polycystic kidneys developed renal failure
at 77 years. His father had one sister and one brother
with normal ultrasound finding at the age of 40.
ADPKD in the patient was first diagnosed on ultra￾sound at the age of 20. At this age he suffered from re￾peated renal colic caused by urate concrements. The
stones passed spontaneously after hydration. He was on
antihypertensive drugs ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor
blocker because of mild hypertension since the age of
25. The blood pressure was well compensated (repeat￾edly below 130/80 mm Hg). There was a mild dilatation
of ascending aorta and mild mitral valve insufficiency on
echocardiography. The renal function started to decline
at the age of 30, with ESRD reached at the age of 45. His
40-year-old sister volunteered herself as a potential kid￾ney donor. Results of her blood group and tissue-type
identified her as a suitable donor with an optimal HLA
match and negative cross-match. However an ultrasound
scan revealed 2 cysts in her left kidney.
The paternal grandmother developed renal failure at
77 years and then was hemodialyzed. The diagnosis of
ADPKD was based on incidental ultrasound finding of
renal and hepatic cysts during examination before chole￾cystectomy at the age of 64. Kidney size was about 16 cm
in diameter, there were multiple cysts about 3 centimeters
and serum creatinine was 180 μmol/l. Computed tomog￾raphy or magnetic resonance were not performed. Moder￾ate renal insufficiency was present.
Methods and results
Molecular analysis
Genomic DNA were isolated from peripheral blood lym￾phocytes by the salting-out procedure [8]. Linkage analysis
was performed, using a panel of five and six CA-repeat
flanking markers for chromosome 16 and chromosome 4,
respectively, which carry the PKD1 and PKD2 genes. The
locations of the markers relative to the PKD1 locus are
shown as follows: D16S521-PKD1-KG8-CW4-CW3-CW2.
The locations of the markers relative to the PKD2 locus
are shown as follows:D4S231-D4S1534-JSTG3-PKD2-
JV108-D4S1563-D4S414. Genotyping was performed by
GelStar labeling of the PCR products and analyzed by
PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Haplotypes
were constructed by hand. As markers are on both ends
of the PKD genes, the recombination can be excluded.
The haplotype analysis for the PKD1 locus identified
that the patient inherited the same haplotype as his un￾affected uncle and for the PKD2 locus the same haplo￾type as his unaffected uncle and aunt. The uncle and
the aunt had normal finding on renal ultrasound at the
age of 40 years, so the ADPKD seemed to be excluded.
If we had considered only the clinical findings and link￾age analysis, we would have concluded that linkage to
both PKD genes was excluded in the family (Figure 1).
Although the haplotype with both PKD1 and PKD2
can be constructed to show that the affected proband
can share an intact haplotype at both loci with his af￾fected grandmother (and of course with his affected
father), the inheritance of the same haplotype in the un￾affected uncle (around the PKD1 locus) or unaffected
uncle and aunt (around the PKD2 locus) could be due to
non-paternity. It has been proven by means of forensic
genetics that all children of the paternal grandmother
are fullsiblings.
Firstly the mutational analysis of the PKD2 gene was
therefore employed in order to identify the causative
mutation in the grandmother with mild clinical course.
However, no mutation was found by mutational analysis
of the PKD2 gene in the grandmother who died at the
age of 80.
We have used long-range PCR (LR-PCR) strategy
folowed by nested PCR for mutational analysis of the PKD1
gene [9]. Sequences of primers for LR PCR of the dupli￾cated region of PKD1 gene (L1 - L8; exons 1 – 34) and con￾ditions are described in detail by Phakdeekitcharoen B et al.
[10]. Sequences of primers for LR PCR of the non￾duplicated region of PKD1 gene (L9; exons 35 – 46; size
5033 bp) were: 1. L9F 50 CTG TGA CCC AAG AGG CTC
AAG AAA 30
, 2 L9R 50 TGA CAC GAG ACA CAC AGT
GAG ACG 30
. LR-PCR amplifications were performed in a
total volume of 50 μl of the mixture containing 300 ng of
genomic DNA, 3.75 U of Expand long template enzyme
mix (Roche Applied Science).), 1× Expand long template
buffer 1 with 1.75 mM MgCl2, 350 μM dNTP and 15 pmol
of each primer. LR-PCR amplification were performed:
5 min at 98°C, followed by 35 cycles of a two-step protocol
that consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, alternating
with an amplicon–specific annealing and extension period
Reiterová et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:59 Page 2 of 6

for 7 min at 64°C for 70°C, followed by a final extension at
72°C for 10 min by using MyCycle PCR system (BioRad].
Using an aliquot of the LR PCR product as a template
(fragments were diluted 1:200–1:500], nested PCR were
performed to produce fragments which were subsequently
analyzed by High Resolution Melting (HRM). Primers for
nested PCR fragments were designed based on published
DNA sequence (accession number L39891).
The coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the
of the PKD1 gene were screened on the whole 71 nested
PCR. Sequences of primers and conditions of nested PCR
are available upon request. Nested PCR were performed by
using Light Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) in a total
volume of 10 μl of the mixture containing 1 μl of diluted
LR product, 1 × Light Cycle 480 High resolution melting
master mix (Roche Applied Science) and 5 pmol of each
primer. Nested PCR amplicons were analyzed with Light
Cycle 480 Gene Scanning Software (Roche Applied Sci￾ence). This software analyzes the high-resolution melting
curve data to identify changes in the shape of the curve that
indicate both homozygous and heterozygous allelic variants
in a sample. The Gene Scanning Software generates a dif￾ference plot by subtracting the curves from a reference
curve and automatically groups samples with similar melt￾ing curves [11]. All nested PCR fragments showing aberrant
melting curves on HRM were sequenced in both directions
using an automatic fluorescent genetic analyzer (ABI
Prism™ 3130 Genetic Analyzer; PE Applied Biosystems) in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Since the linkage analysis was not informative and mu￾tational analysis of the PKD2 gene in the grandmother
was negative, the mutational analysis of the PKD1 gene
was performed in attempt to identify the causative muta￾tion in the patient before related kidney transplantation.
The unique frameshifting mutation in the PKD1 gene p.
Val1105ArgfsX4 (c.3312dupC) (new mutation) was iden￾tified in the 45-year-old proband and in his 69-year-old
father (Figure 2). The mutation p.Val1105ArgfsX4 was
not present in the sister of the proband who had two
cysts on a kidney on ultrasound at 40 years. Related pre￾emptive transplantation from the sister was done.
The above described mutation was suggested to be
present as a germinal and a somatic mosaic in the grand￾mother with mild clinical course of ADPKD. The mutation
was visible in the grandmother´s DNA sample, the mutant
allele was at a lower level than that found in the patient.
DNA for quantitative assay of mutated allele dosage from
buccal cells was not available from grandmother. Neither
DNA samples nor ultrasound finding of kidneys of the par￾ents of grandmother were available, as well. But her father
died at the age of 72 because of lung cancer and her
mother died at the age of 89. Finally, real time PCR using
allele specific primers was performed on LightCycler 480
(Roche) to quantify the somatic mosaic in the grandmother
(for mutation in the PKD1 gene p.Val1105ArgfsX4). Using
an aliquot of the LR PCR product as a template (fragments
werediluted 1:200–1:500), nested PCR was performed to
produce fragmentswhich were subsequently analyzed by
High Resolution Melting (HRM).Forward primer for mu￾tated allele R39M1F 5´ACAGGTGAGTACCTCCTGAC

The responsible PKD1 haplotype (33123) seemed to be in affected, as well in non-affected 
brother. The grandmother had the PKD1 mutation in mosaicism (confirmed by further 
analysis), therefor she had only some percentage of affected germinal cells.

CCG3´, forward primer for normal allele R39NF 5´ACA
GGTGAGTACCTCCTGACCG3´ and one reverse primer
R39NR 5´CCGAAGTCCCACGTGTAAAG3´. Real Time
PCR was performed by Light Cycler 480 (Roche Applied
Science) in a total volume of 10 μl of the mixture
containing 1 μl of diluted LR product, 1 × Light Cycle 480
High resolution meltingmaster mix (Roche Applied Sci￾ence) and 5 pmol of each primer. RT PCR amplifications
were performed: 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of a
protocol that consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s,
annealing at 62°C for 15 s and extension at 72°C for 20 s,
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Real
TimePCR was analyzed by relative quantification using
Light Cycler 480 Software (Roche Applied Science). Such
analysis showed that 10% of the chromosomes in grand￾mother possesses aforemetioned mutation.
Later on, during further PKD1 mutation analysis, the
described missense mutation in the PKD1 gene p.
Thr2250Met (c.6749C > T) was identified in the proband.
Surprisingly this mutation was inherited from his clinically
healthy 70-year-old mother (kidneys on ultrasound without
cysts, normal renal function). The proband inherited the
frameshift mutation p.Val1105ArgfsX4 from his affected
father and the missense mutation p.Thr2250Met from his
mother, so the mutations had to be in trans-position.
Because renal ultrasound on the mother was normal, a
CT scan was performed, showing two small cysts. More￾over this missense mutation was identified in his sister
who was a donor of the kidney. We can speculate that
this missense mutation could contribute to the develop￾ment of two renal cysts in the sister.
Discussion
The family initially appearing unlinked to the PKD1
gene and PKD2 gene is presented. Firstly the family was
considered to be probably PKD3 family. A definitive,
predictive testing for the sister of the proband before
preemptive kidney transplantation was impossible from
linkage analysis. The exclusion of ADPKD in any pro￾spective kidney donor in families with ADPKD is vital
because of the risk of potential living donors developing
the polycystic disease themselves.
At least one family member with ESRD at or after 70 -
years of age is highly predictive of PKD2 mutations [12].
Because of mild clinical course of ADPKD in grand￾mother (ESRD at the of 77) the mutational analysis of
the PKD2 gene was first done. No mutation was
detected by heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing.
The mutational analysis of the PKD1 gene in the pa￾tient with advanced chronic renal insufficiency was
Figure 2 Sequencing pattern of the part of the exon 15 (reverse strand) in proband with heterozygous mutation c.3312dupC
(p.Val1105ArgfsX4) of the PKD1 gene, in grandmother with mosaicism and in healthy person.
Reiterová et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:59 Page 4 of 6

therefore employed in attempt to identify the causative
mutation. The frameshifting mutation p.Val1105ArgfsX4
in the PKD1 gene was identified in the patient and was
not present in a potential donor, in his sister. In spite of
the presence of two cysts on ultrasound of the 40-year-old
sister the preemptive kidney transplantation was under￾taken. Renal transplantation is the optimal treatment for
ADPKD and the benefits of preemptive transplantation
have long been recognized.
The grandmother must have been a somatic and
germinal mosaic for the frameshifting mutation p.
Val1105ArgfsX4 in the PKD1 gene and the father
inherited this mutation from her and transferred the af￾fected allele to his son. Approximately 10% of ADPKD
families have a negative family history, and in several
cases de novo mutations have been revealed [13]. Some
of the new cases have been shown to occur as a mosaic
[6,7]. As mosaicism would not normally be detected
from mutation screening, a significant proportion of de
novo cases in mosaic form can be missed. Later, the
possible mutation p.Thr2250Met in sister was identified.
The risk of cyst development in donor-sister, as well as
in the graft in brother is probably a little higher. We can
speculate that more cysts will develop but hopefully the
renal involvement will be mild. The development of
possible cysts in donor sister, as well in proband, will be
regularly examined.
The gene PKD1 is highly polymorphic with about 10
neutral variants found per patient from sequencing [14].
The significance of missense mutation p.Thr2250Met in
exon 15 is not unambiguous. Missense mutation p.
Thr2250Met was found in three different families in
France [15]. Firstly, this change was reflected in both the
Grantham matrix score and the more formal analysis as
likely pathogenic mutation Group C in the ADPKD Mu￾tation Database (http://pkdb.mayo.edu). Thereafter, this
change was reclassified as likely neutral in this database.
On the other hand, p.Thr2250Met mutation is described
as disease causing mutation with medium risk in Human
Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional 2012.3.
p.Thr2250Met mutation in homozygosity and in com￾bination with SEC63 gene mutations contributed to
severe phenotype in a patient with hepatic cysts in
comparison with his relatives who had p.Thr2250Met
mutation in heterozygous state [16]. This last finding
supports the influence of this allele on clinical course.
This allele in heterozygosity in the 40-year-old sister of
the proband was associated with only occasional cyst de￾velopment, the 70-year-old mother with the same
change had no cysts on ultrasound. It seems that this
likely pathogenic missense mutation is more likely an in￾completely penetrant allele. The allele alone may result
in mild cystic disease. Probably this change is only asso￾ciated with a handful of renal cysts by middle age in
some cases. This allele could contribute to the earlier
ESRD in the proband (45 years) in comparison with his
father (52 years). The difference in the ages of ESRD was
only 7 years, however, father of the proband had severe
hypertension that was not well compensated. Hyperten￾sion is clearly associated with more severe ADPKD irre￾spective of genetic background.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we describe first an ADPKD family with
variable clinical course caused by mosaicism in one af￾fected family member and by an incompletely penetrant
allele in others. The most severe clinical case in the fam￾ily was caused by combination of the PKD1 gene
frameshifting mutation and hypomorphic PKD1 allele.
Moreover, this report illustrates the role of molecular
genetic testing in assessing young related kidney donors
for patients with ADPKD.
