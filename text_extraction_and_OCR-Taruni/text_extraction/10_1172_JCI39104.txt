The origins ofthe mesenchymal cells participating in tissue repair and pathological processes, notably tissue fibro￾sis, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis, are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that epithe￾lial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here, processes
similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development are appropri￾ated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias.The identification ofthe signaling pathways that
lead to activation of EMT programs during these disease processes is providing new insights into the plasticity of
cellular phenotypes and possible therapeutic interventions.
What is epithelial-mesenchymal transition?
An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process
that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts
with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo mul￾tiple biochemical changesthat enable it to assume a mesenchymal
cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, inva￾siveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased
production of ECM components (1). The completion of an EMT
is signaled by the degradation of underlying basement membrane
and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away
from the epithelial layer in which it originated.
A number of distinct molecular processes are engaged in orderto
initiate an EMT and enable it to reach completion. These include
activation of transcription factors, expression of specific cell-sur￾face proteins, reorganization and expression of cytoskeletal pro￾teins, production of ECM-degrading enzymes, and changes in the
expression ofspecific microRNAs. In many cases, the involved fac￾tors are also used as biomarkers to demonstrate the passage of a
cell through an EMT (Figure 1).
The pioneeringwork ofElizabethHay first described an “epithelial￾mesen­chymaltransformation”using amodelof chickprimitive streak
formation (2).In the intervening time,the term “transformation”has
been replaced with “transition,” reflecting in part the reversibility of
the process and the factthatitis distinctfrom neoplastic transforma￾tion (1). The phenotypic plasticity afforded by an EMT isrevealed by
the occurrence ofthe reverse process—amesen­chymal-epithelialtran￾sition (MET), which involvesthe conversion of mesenchymal cellsto
epithelial derivatives.Relatively little is known aboutthis process;the
best-studied example is the MET associated with kidney formation,
which is driven by genessuch as paired box 2 (Pax2), bone morphoge￾netic protein 7 (Bmp7), and Wilmstumor 1 (Wt1) (3–5).
Why does EMT occur?
The concept of cell division as a way to generate more cells and
expand tissue size emerged about 150 years ago (6). Central to
this concept was an understanding that all cells in a body derive
from other cells and the resulting deduction that ultimately all are
derived from a single cell, the fertilized egg. An additional level of
complexity came from the realization that cells can assume various
phenotypic states during development, that is, they can undergo
the process of differentiation. As was learned more recently, dur￾ing specific steps of embryogenesis and organ development, the
cells within certain epithelia appear to be plastic and thus able to
move back and forth between epithelial and mesenchymal states
via the processes of EMT and MET (7). Upon completion of the
development of epithelial tissues, the epithelial cellstypically exert
tissue-specific function, while the mesenchymal cells in such tis￾sue play a supporting role. Implied in this notion was the further
idea that a state of terminal differentiation is necessary to carry
out such specialized functions and that cells are maintained in a
permanent state of differentiation once development is complete.
This concept has been challenged by numerous observationsthat
the cells within a terminally differentiated epithelium can indeed
change their phenotype through activation of an EMT program,
which enables transdifferentiation, resulting in the conversion of
epithelial cells to mesenchymal derivatives during development
and adulthood. These programs can also be activated in associa￾tion with tissue repair and pathological stresses, including those
creating various types of inflammation and high-grade carcino￾mas. Accordingly, EMTs now constitute recognized mechanisms
for dispersing cells in embryos, forming mesenchymal cells in
injured tissues, and initiating the invasive and metastatic behavior
of epithelial cancers.
Classification of EMT into three different subtypes
EMTs are encountered in three distinct biological settings that
carry very different functional consequences (Figure 2). While the
specific signals that delineate the EMTs in the three discrete set￾tings are not yet clear, it is now well accepted that functional dis￾tinctions are apparent. A proposal to classify EMTs into three dif￾ferent biologicalsubtypes based on the biological context in which
they occur was discussed at a 2007 meeting on EMT in Poland
and a subsequent meeting in March 2008 at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratories. The EMTs that are associated with implantation,
embryo formation, and organ development are organized to gen￾erate diverse cell types that share common mesenchymal pheno￾types. This class of EMTs, which we and others(8) propose to term

“type 1,” neither causesfibrosis norinduces an invasive phenotype
resulting in systemic spread via the circulation. Among other out￾comes, these type 1 EMTs can generate mesenchymal cells(prima￾ry mesenchyme) that have the potential to subsequently undergo
a MET to generate secondary epithelia.
The EMTs associated with wound healing, tissue regeneration,
and organ fibrosis are of a second type. In these type 2 EMTs, the
program begins as part of a repair-associated event that normally
generatesfibroblasts and otherrelated cellsin orderto reconstruct
tissues following trauma and inflammatory injury. However, in
contrast to type 1 EMTs, these type 2 EMTs are associated with
inflammation and cease once inflammation is attenuated, as is
seen during wound healing and tissue regeneration. In the setting
of organ fibrosis, type 2 EMTs can continue to respond to ongo￾ing inflammation, leading eventually to organ destruction. Tissue
fibrosis is in essence an unabated form of wound healing due to
persistent inflammation.
Type 3 EMTs occur in neoplastic cells that have previously
undergone genetic and epigenetic changes, specifically in genes
that favor clonal outgrowth and the development of localized
tumors. These changes, notably affecting oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, conspire with the EMT regulatory circuitry to
produce outcomes far different from those observed in the other
two types of EMT. Carcinoma cells undergoing a type 3 EMT may
invade and metastasize and thereby generate the final, life-threat￾ening manifestations of cancer progression. Importantly, cancer
cells may pass through EMTs to differing extents, with some cells
retaining many epithelialtraitswhile acquiring some mesenchymal
ones and other cells shedding all vestiges of their epithelial origin
and becoming fully mesenchymal. It is still unclear what specific
signals induce type 3 EMTs in carcinoma cells. For example, such
signals may originate in the tumor stroma that is associated with
many primary carcinomas.
While these three classes of EMTs represent distinct biologi￾cal processes, a common set of genetic and biochemical elements
appears to underlie and thus enable these outwardly diverse phe￾notypic programs. As more experiments are performed in the
future, we will learn more regarding the similarities and differ￾ences among the three classes of EMTs.
Type 1 EMT: EMT during implantation, embryogenesis, 
and organ development
Following the earliest stages of embryogenesis, the implantation
of the embryo and the initiation of placenta formation are both
associated with an EMT that involvesthe parietal endoderm (9). In
particular, the trophoectoderm cells, which are precursors of the
cytotrophoblast, undergo an EMT in order to facilitate invasion
of the endometrium and the subsequent proper anchoring of the
placenta, enabling its function in nutrient and gas exchange (10,
11). As described briefly below, this is only the first of many type 1
EMTs that accompany and underlie embryonic morphogenesis;
more detail regarding some of the EMTs that occur during devel￾opment are discussed elsewhere (12).
A fertilized egg undergoes gastrulation, generating three germ
layers. Initially, a primitive streak is generated in the epiblast layer
(13). The epithelial cells in this tissue express E-cadherin and
exhibit apical-basal polarity. Formation of the primitive streak is
considered to be the first sign of gastrulation, which leads in turn
to the formation of the three germ layers that generate all tissue
types of the body. The primitive streak is formed from a furrowed
invagination in the midline of the epiblast layerthat formsinitially
at the lower extremity of the embryo and, later on, extends in the
direction of the future head. The epithelial-like cells of the epiblast
undergo programmed changes dictated by specific expression of
proteins associated with cell migration and differentiation (14).
Once formed, the primitive streak, acting via invagination or
ingression (depending on the species studied), generates the
mesendoderm, which subsequently separates to form the meso￾derm and the endoderm via an EMT (also known as epiblast-meso￾derm transition) (2) by replacing the hypoblast cells, which pre￾sumably either undergo apoptosis or contribute to the mesoderm
layer via an EMT. The embryonic mesoderm that forms between
the epiblast and hypoblast eventually gives rise to primary mesen￾chyme associated with the axial, paraxial, intermediate, and lateral
Figure 1
EMT. An EMT involves a functional transition of polarized epithelial cells into mobile and ECM component–secreting mesenchymal cells. The 
epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers commonly used by EMT researchers are listed. Colocalization of these two sets of distinct markers 
defines an intermediate phenotype of EMT, indicating cells that have passed only partly through an EMT. Detection of cells expressing both sets 
of markers makes it impossible to identify all mesenchymal cells that originate from the epithelia via EMT, as many mesenchymal cells likely 
shed all epithelial markers once a transition is completed. For this reason, most studies in mice use irreversible epithelial cell–lineage tagging 
to address the full range of EMT-induced changes. ZO-1, zona occludens 1; MUC1, mucin 1, cell surface associated; miR200, microRNA 200;

plate mesodermal layers (15). Cells of the primary mesenchyme
exhibit enhanced migratory properties when compared with those
of the epiblast and the hypoblast (15).
At the biochemical level, the EMT associated with gastrulation
is dependent on and orchestrated by canonical Wnt signaling,
and embryos deficient in Wnt3 cannot undergo the EMT associ￾ated with gastrulation (16, 17). The subsequent formation of the
primitive streak is associated with expression of Wnt8c, and ectopic
expression of Wnt8c in embryos leads to multiple primitive streaks
(18, 19). TGF-β superfamily proteins, notably Nodal and Vg1, medi￾ate the action of Wnts, and their deficiencies can lead to mesoder￾mal defects due to the absence of functional EMTs (20–24). Wnts
also cooperate with FGF receptors to help regulate an EMT associ￾ated with gastrulation (25–28). The Snail, Eomes, and Mesps tran￾scription factors orchestrate the EMT associated with gastrulation
(29–31). For example, Snail represses E-cadherin and induces EMT
mediated by cell adhesion molecules, such as occludins and clau￾dins, and by polarity genes, such as Discs large (Dlg) and Crumbs
homolog 3 (Crb3) (32–34).
During embryonic development, an EMT involving the epithe￾lial cells of the neuroectoderm gives rise to migratory neural crest
cells(35). Initially, the premigratory neural crest cells express genes
such as Sox, Snail, Slug, and forkhead box D3 (FoxD3), and these
cells subsequently undergo an EMT (36, 37). As a consequence,
they then dissociate from the neural folds, become motile, and
disperse to the different parts of the embryo, where they undergo
further differentiation into, among other cell types, the melano￾cytes that provide pigment to the skin.
This EMT occurring in the neural crest is triggered by signaling
pathways similar to those orchestrating the EMT associated with
gastrulation. Thus, signaling pathways mediated by Wnts, FGFs,
BMPs, c-Myb, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx-1) conspire to induce
EMT (38–40). Among them, BMP most prominently induces the
migratory property of neural crest cells. Noggin, an inhibitor
of BMP, is essential in negatively regulating this activity, and its
expression places a hold on EMT (41, 42). Additionally, E-cadherin
and N-cadherin, two cell adhesion molecules, need to be repressed
in order for neural crest EMT to occur (43). By some estimates,
EMT programs are deployed during several subsequent phases of
embryogenesis, indicating the continued involvement ofthese pro￾grams later in development, such as the endothelial-mesenchymal
transition (EndMT) that takes place during heart valve formation.
Type 2 EMT: EMT associated with tissue regeneration 
and organ fibrosis
Organ fibrosis, which occurs in a number of epithelial tissues, is
mediated by inflammatory cells and fibroblaststhat release a vari￾ety of inflammatory signals as well as components of a complex
ECM that includes collagens, laminins, elastin, and tenacins (Fig￾ure 3). More specifically, such EMTs are found to be associated
with fibrosis occurring in kidney, liver, lung, and intestine (44–47).
Some of the earliest proof of this came from the study of trans￾genic mice bearing germ-line reporter genes whose expression was
driven by epithelial cell–specific promoters. The behavior of these
reporters provided direct evidence for epithelial cells serving, via
EMTs, asimportant precursors of the fibroblaststhat arise during
the course of organ fibrosis (48–50).
Fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1; also known as S100A4 and
MTS-1), an S100 class of cytoskeletal protein,α-SMA, and collagenI
have provided reliable markers to characterize the mesenchymal
products generated by the EMTs that occur during the develop￾ment of fibrosis in various organs (48, 49, 51). These markers,
along with discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2),
vimentin, and desmin, have been used to identify epithelial cells of
the kidney, liver, lung, and intestine that are in the midst of under￾going an EMT associated with chronic inflammation. Such cells
continued to exhibit epithelial-specific morphology and molecu￾lar markers, such as cytokeratin and E-cadherin, but showed
concomitant expression of the FSP1 mesenchymal marker and
α-SMA. Such cells are likely to represent the intermediate stages
Figure 2
Different types of EMT. (A) Type 1 EMT is asso￾ciated with implantation and embryonic gas￾trulation and gives rise to the mesoderm and 
endoderm and to mobile neural crest cells. The 
primitive epithelium, specifically the epiblast, 
gives rise to primary mesenchyme via an EMT. 
This primary mesenchyme can be re-induced to 
form secondary epithelia by a MET. It is specu￾lated that such secondary epithelia may further 
differentiate to form other types of epithelial tis￾sues and undergo subsequent EMT to generate 
the cells of connective tissue, including astro￾cytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, 
and muscle cells. (B) EMTs are re-engaged 
in the context of inflammation and fibrosis and 
represent the type 2 EMTs. Unlike the type 1 
EMT, the type 2 EMT is expressed over extend￾ed periods of time and can eventually destroy 
an affected organ if the primary inflammatory 
insult is not removed or attenuated. (C) Finally, 
the secondary epithelia associated with many 
organs can transform into cancer cells that later 
undergo the EMTs that enable invasion and 
metastasis, thereby representing type 3 EMTs.

of EMT, when epithelial markers continue to be expressed but new
mesenchymal markers have already been acquired. The behavior
of these cells provided one of the first indications that epithelial
cells under inflammatory stresses can advance to various extents
through an EMT, creating the notion of “partial EMTs” (Figure 1).
Eventually these cells leave the epithelial layer, negotiate their way
through the underlying basement membrane, and accumulate in
the interstitium of the tissue (52), where they ultimately shed all of
their epithelial markers and gain a fully fibroblastic phenotype.
Recent experimentsin mice have demonstrated that endothelial
cells associated with the microvasculature can also contribute to
the formation of mesenchymal cells during the course of fibrosis,
doing so via an analogous process known as EndMT (44). This
pathologic process echoes a similar normal process occurring dur￾ing development (45). Thus, during embryogenesis, an EndMT
occurs during the organization of the endocardial cushion and
the heart valves. In cardiac fibrosis associated with post-ischemic
injury of the heart, EndMT, which involves both the endocardium
(the inner endothelial layer of the heart) and the microvascular
endothelium of the heart, has been demonstrated to play a key role
in contributing to the emergence of newly formed fibroblasts (45)
(Figure 4). In tissue culture models of EndMT, TGF-β1 induces
EndMT of capillary endothelial cells and the loss of endothelial
markers, such CD31 and integrin αVβ3, as well as the acquisition
of fibroblast- and myofibroblast-specific markers such as FSP1,
α-SMA, DDR2, collagen I, and vimentin. While not yet document￾ed, it is plausible that many of the molecular regulators of EMTs
also play critical roles in orchestrating EndMTs.
In one analysis (1), lineage-tagging experiments and bone mar￾row transplant studies demonstrated that during the course of
kidney fibrosis in mice, about 12% of fibroblasts are derived from
the bone marrow and about 30% are derived via EMT from the
tubular epithelial cells of the kidney. In addition, it has been
shown more recently that in kidney fibrosis about 35% of fibro￾blasts are derived via EndMT from the endothelial cells nor￾mally residing within the kidney. The remaining portions are
speculated to arise via activation of resident fibroblasts or other
mesenchymal cells, such as perivascular smooth muscle cells/
pericytes and fibrocytes (53) in the circulation (Figure 4). It is
likely that these proportions may vary dramatically, depending
on the stage of fibrosis, the organ, and the particular experimen￾tal model being studied.
This complex pathologic process may reflect the developmental
origins of the kidney. Thus, the entire epithelium of the kidney,
including the tubular epithelial cells, is derived from the intermediate
mesoderm during the development of the urogenital system. More
specifically, a mesenchyme condenses over the ureteric bud (derived
from the endoderm) to give rise to the glomerular and tubular epi￾thelial structures of the kidney (54), doing so via a MET. This hints
at a peculiar aspect of renal biology: by retaining some imprint of
their mesenchymal origins, kidney epithelial cells may be particularly
prone to return to this state, via the EMTs that occur in response to
inflammatory stress and lead to pathologic fibrosis(55, 56).
Inflammatory injury to the mouse kidney can result in the
recruitment of a diverse array of cells that can trigger an EMT
through their release of growth factors, such as TGF-β, PDGF,
EGF, and FGF-2 (57). Most prominent among these cells are
macrophages and activated resident fibroblasts that accumulate
at the site of injury and release these growth factors. In addition,
these cellsrelease chemokines and MMPs, notably MMP-2, MMP-3,
and MMP-9. Epithelial cells come under the influence of these sig￾naling molecules and, acting together with the inflammatory cells,
induce basement membrane damage and focal degradation of type
IV collagen and laminin (57). Delaminated epithelial cells may then
migrate toward the interstitial area (the space between epithelial
layers) underthe influence of gradients of growth factors and other
chemoattractants (57). This initial recruitment of epithelial cells
into an EMT can be inhibited by blocking the expression of MMP-9
through the disruption of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (58).
Otherstudies have also demonstrated that HGF can decrease levels
of TGF-β, restore TGF-β–mediated loss of E-cadherin, and poten￾tially decrease amounts of active MMP-9 (59). β1 integrin and inte￾grin-linked kinase (ILK) are also identified asimportant mediators
of the TGF-β–induced EMT associated with tubular epithelial cells
Figure 3
EMT and fibrosis. The EMTs associated with fibrosis are associated with inflammation and the generation of numerous types of molecules by 
inflammatory cells and resident activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts). These molecules cause disruption of the epithelial layers via degradation 
of the basement membrane. The epithelial cells lose polarity and either undergo apoptosis (the majority of cells) or EMT (the minority of cells).

(60). TGF-β induces EMT via both a Smad2/3-dependent pathway
and a MAPK-dependent pathway. Recent experiments have also
demonstrated a key role forthe E-cadherin/β-catenin signaling axis
for EMT involving epithelial cells (61, 62).
The significance of TGF-β–induced EMT for progression of
organ fibrosis has been demonstrated in studies using BMP-7, an
antagonist of TGF-β signaling, in mouse models of kidney, liver,
billiard tract, lung, and intestinal fibrosis (51, 63). BMP-7 func￾tions as an endogenousinhibitor of TGF-β–induced EMT (51, 63)
(Figure 4). Among other effects, itreversesthe TGF-β–induced loss
of the key epithelial protein, E-cadherin (63). Restoration of E-cad￾herin levels by BMP-7 is mediated via its cognate receptors, activin￾like kinase–2/3/6 (ALK-2/3/6), and the Smad4/5 downstream
transcription factors (63). Systemic administration of recombi￾nant BMP-7 to mice with severe fibrosis resulted in reversal of
EMT and repair of damaged epithelial structures, with repopula￾tion of healthy epithelial cells, all presumably mediated via a MET
(63). This reversal was also associated with restoration of organ
function, a substantial decrease in FSP1+ and α-SMA+ interstitial
fibroblasts, and the de novo activation of BMP-7 signaling (63).
Studiesusing fibrosistissue fromhumanshave alsodemonstrated
EMT (50). In a study of 133 patients with kidney fibrosis, an EMT
was demonstrated in a substantial number of the samples, as
evaluated using double labeling of the tubular epithelial cells with
cytokeratin, vimentin, α-SMA, or zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). Simi￾larly, in patients with Crohn disease, an EMT was demonstrated in
areas of fibrosisin the colon (64). Such studiesshould provide the
necessary confidence to develop novel therapeutic interventionsin
order to suppress EMTs and potentially reverse organ fibrosis.
Type 3 EMT: EMT associated with cancer progression 
and metastasis
Excessive epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis are hall￾marks of the initiation and early growth of primary epithelial
cancers (65). The subsequent acquisition of invasiveness, initially
manifest by invasion through the basement membrane, isthought
to herald the onset of the last stages of the multi-step process that
leads eventually to metastatic dissemination, with life-threatening
consequences. The genetic controls and biochemical mechanisms
underlying the acquisition ofthe invasive phenotype and the subse￾quentsystemic spread ofthe cancer cell have been areas of intensive
research. In many of these studies, activation of an EMT program
has been proposed as the critical mechanism for the acquisition of
malignant phenotypes by epithelial cancer cells (66).
Many mouse studies and cell culture experiments have demon￾strated that carcinoma cells can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype
and express mesenchymal markers such as α-SMA, FSP1, vimentin,
and desmin (67). These cells typically are seen at the invasive front
of primary tumors and are considered to be the cells that eventually
enter into subsequent steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e.,
intravasation, transport through the circulation, extravasation, for￾mation of micrometastases, and ultimately colonization (the growth
ofsmall coloniesinto macroscopic metastases) (66, 68, 69).
An apparent paradox comes from the observation that the
EMT-derived migratory cancer cells typically establish second￾ary colonies at distant sites that resemble, at the histopathologi￾cal level, the primary tumor from which they arose; accordingly,
they no longer exhibit the mesenchymal phenotypes ascribed to
metastasizing carcinoma cells. Reconciling this behavior with

depicted. One study suggests that about 12% of fibroblasts are from bone marrow, about 30% can arise via local EMT involving tubular epithelial 
cells under inflammatory stress, and about 35% are from EndMT (1). The remaining percentage likely emerge via proliferation of the resident 
fibroblasts and other still unidentified sources. (B) Systemic treatment of mice with renal fibrosis with recombinant human BMP-7 reverses renal

the proposed role of EMT as a facilitator of metastatic dissemi￾nation requires the additional notion that metastasizing cancer
cells must shed their mesenchymal phenotype via a MET during
the course of secondary tumor formation (70). The tendency of
disseminated cancer cells to undergo MET likely reflects the local
microenvironments that they encounter after extravasation into
the parenchyma of a distant organ, quite possibly the absence of
the heterotypic signalsthey experienced in the primary tumorthat
were responsible for inducing the EMT in the first place (66, 71,
72). These considerations indicate that induction of an EMT is
likely to be a centrally important mechanism for the progression
of carcinomas to a metastatic stage and implicates MET during
the subsequent colonization process (Figure 5). However, many
steps of this mechanistic model still require direct experimental
validation. Moreover, it remains unclear at present whether these
phenomena and molecular mechanisms relate to and explain the
metastatic dissemination of non-epithelial cancer cells.
The full spectrum of signaling agents that contribute to EMTs
of carcinoma cells remains unclear. One suggestion is that the
genetic and epigenetic alterations undergone by cancer cells dur￾ing the course of primary tumor formation render them espe￾cially responsive to EMT-inducing heterotypic signals originating
in the tumor-associated stroma. Oncogenes induce senescence,
and recent studies suggest that cancer cell EMTs may also play
a role in preventing senescence induced by oncogenes, thereby
facilitating subsequent aggressive dissemination (73–75). In
the case of many carcinomas, EMT-inducing signals emanating
from the tumor-associated stroma, notably HGF, EGF, PDGF,
and TGF-β, appear to be responsible for the induction or func￾tional activation in cancer cells of a series of EMT-inducing
transcription factors, notably Snail, Slug, zinc finger E-box bind￾ing homeobox 1 (ZEB1), Twist, Goosecoid, and FOXC2 (66, 71,
76–79). Once expressed and activated, each of these transcription
factors can act pleiotropically to choreograph the complex EMT
program, more often than not with the help of other members
of this cohort of transcription factors. The actual implementa￾tion by these cells of their EMT program depends on a series of
intracellular signaling networks involving, among other signal￾transducing proteins, ERK, MAPK, PI3K, Akt, Smads, RhoB,
β-catenin, lymphoid enhancer binding factor(LEF), Ras, and c-Fos
as well as cell surface proteins such as β4 integrins, α5β1 integ￾rin, and αVβ6 integrin (80). Activation of EMT programs is also
facilitated by the disruption of cell-cell adherens junctions and
the cell-ECM adhesions mediated by integrins (67, 75, 81–86).
TGF-β is an importantsuppressor of epithelial cell proliferation
and thus primary tumorigenesis. However, it is now clear that in
certain contexts it can also serve as a positive regulator of tumor
progression and metastasis (87–89). Thus, in vitro studies have
demonstrated that TGF-β can induce an EMT in certain types
of cancer cells (90). Two possible signaling pathways have been
identified as mediators of TGF-β–induced EMT. The first of these
involves Smad proteins, which mediate TGF-β action to induce
EMTs via the ALK-5 receptor (51, 91–95). Smad-mediated signal￾ing induced by TGF-β facilitates motility. Inhibitory Smads modu￾late differential effects of relevant transcription factors and cyto￾plasmic kinases and induce the autocrine production of TGF-β,
which can furtherreinforce and amplify the EMT program (91, 92,
96, 97). Signaling pathways that mediate the action of β-catenin
and LEF also cooperate with Smads (61, 98) in inducing an EMT
(61, 99, 100). In this regard, the involvement of LEF and β-catenin
in PDGF-induced EMT was recently described (98). These studies
collectively demonstrate that the TGF-β/Smad/LEF/PDGF axis is
an important inducer of an EMT phenotype in cancer.
Evidence for the involvement of a second TGF-β–induced
pathway in EMT is also compelling. More specifically, some data
indicate that p38 MAPK and RhoA mediate an autocrine TGF-β–
induced EMT in NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells (96,
101). This process also requiresintegrin β1–mediated signaling and
the activation oflatent TGF-β by αVβ6 integrin (96, 101). Fibulin-5,
an ECM molecule, augments TGF-β–induced EMT in a MAPK￾dependent mechanism (102). TGF-β can induce an EMT in Ras￾transformed hepatocytes, mammary epithelial cells (via MAPK),
and MDCK cells; at the same time, Ras-activated PI3K inhibits
TGF-β–induced apoptosis to facilitate this transition (103–106).
Evidence for these connections comes from observations that
ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways mediate Ras mutant–induced
EMT, and that such an EMT is reversed by either wild-type Ras or
MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitors (106). In this regard, Raf also
mediates TGF-β–induced EMT and promotes invasiveness of can￾cer cells. In mouse models of skin carcinoma and human colon
cancer, the absence of TGF-β receptor expression actually confers
better prognosis(107, 108). The connection between inflammation
and EMT was demonstrated when COX-2 was shown to inactivate
Smad signaling and enhance EMT stimulated by TGF-β through

membrane also changes, altering cell-ECM interactions and signaling networks. The next step involves EMT and an angiogenic switch, facilitat￾ing the malignant phase of tumor growth. Progression from this stage to metastatic cancer also involves EMTs, enabling cancer cells to enter 
the circulation and exit the blood stream at a remote site, where they may form micro- and macro-metastases, which may involve METs and 
thus a reversion to an epithelial phenotype.

a PGE2-dependent mechanism (109). Changes in the expression
of certain cell polarity proteins may also play an important role
in TGF-β–induced EMT, since evidence of a role for partitioning￾defective protein 6 (Par6) in this process is emerging (66, 110).
The connection between loss of E-cadherin expression by cancer
cells and passage through an EMT has been established by many
studies (111, 112). For example, induction of the c-Fos oncogene in
normal mouse mammary epithelial cell linesinduces an EMT and is
associated with a decrease in E-cadherin expression (99). Moreover,
epithelial cell adhesion complexesreorganize and cell proliferation is
suppressedwhen the full-length orthe cytoplasmic portion ofE-cad￾herin (containing the β-catenin binding site) is ectopically expressed
in cellsthat have passed through an EMT, causing such cellsto lose
their mesenchymal phenotype (99, 113). Sequestration of β-catenin
in the cytoplasm is important for the preservation of epithelial fea￾tures of cancer cells, and acquisition ofthe mesenchymal phenotype
correlates with the movement of β-catenin to the nucleus, where
it becomes part of Tcf/LEF complexes (100, 114). Such β-catenin
accumulation in the nucleus, which is often associated with loss of
E-cadherin expression, correlateswith susceptibility to enterinto an
EMT and acquisition of an invasive phenotype (61, 66). Thus, cells
that lose cell surface E-cadherin become more responsive to induc￾tion of an EMT by various growth factors(61).
Some studies have demonstrated that the epigenetic control of
E-cadherin and β-catenin/LEF activity is important in establishing
the metastatic potential of cancer cells(115–118). Cell linesthat lack
E-cadherinshowincreasedtumorigenicity andmetastasiswhentrans￾ferred into immunodeficient mice (118). E-cadherin expression levels
vary dramatically in different human tumors, and an inverse relation￾ship between levels of E-cadherin and patientsurvival has been docu￾mented (117). In this regard, mutations in the E-cadherin gene have
beenidentified incancer cells, making them more susceptible toEMT
and metastasis (115, 116). A more thorough analysis of such muta￾tions and their correlation to metastatic progression isstillrequired.
The central role played by E-cadherin loss in the EMT program is
furtherillustrated by the actions ofseveral EMT-inducing transcrip￾tion factorsthatfacilitate acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype,
such as Snail and Slug, as well as those encoding two key zinc fin￾ger–containing basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors,survival
of motor neuron protein interacting protein 1 (SIP1) and E12 (also
known as E47-E2A). These transcription factors are induced by
TGF-β exposure and, once expressed,repress E-cadherin expression
(78). Snail also facilitates an invasive phenotype in mice (31). Loss
of E-cadherin promotes Wnt signaling and is associated with high
levels of Snail in the nucleus(119). SIP1 represses E-cadherin expres￾sion and binds, along with Snail, to the E-cadherin promoter in an
overlapping fashion (120, 121). The expression of Snail and E-cad￾herin correlates inversely with the prognosis of patients suffering
from breast cancer or oralsquamous cell carcinoma (119, 122). The
use of gene expression analyses to compare expression of genes in
metastatic and non-metastatic mouse breast cancer cell lines hasled
to the identification of Twist and Goosecoid as important genes that
facilitate EMT and induce metastasis(85, 123). Some have reported
that matrix-degrading enzymes such as MMP-3 facilitate EMT by
inducing genomic instability via Rac1b and ROS (124).
Noncoding microRNAs are also components of the cellular sig￾naling circuitry that regulates the EMT program. For example,
microRNA 200 (miR200) and miR205 inhibit the repressors of
E-cadherin expression, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and thereby help in main￾taining the epithelial cell phenotype (125–129).In breast carcinoma,
a loss of miR200 correlates with increased expression of vimentin
and a decrease in the levels of E-cadherin in cancer cells (125–127,
129). Acting in the opposite direction, miR21 is upregulated in
many cancers and facilitates TGF-β–induced EMT (130). Interest￾ingly, CD44hiCD20lo cells purified from normal and malignant
breast cancer tissue exhibit features of an EMT, and human cancer
cellsinduced to undergo EMT exhibitstem cell–like properties and
increased metastatic potential (84). Therefore, EMT may play a role
in the generation of high-grade invasive cellswith stem cell–like fea￾tures, and the latter phenotype, which includes self-renewal poten￾tial, may facilitate the formation ofsecondary tumors by disseminat￾ing cancer cells, a notion thatstill requires direct demonstration.
Perspective
It is now clear that EMTs occur in three distinct biological settings.
While the outcome isthe generation of motile cells of mesenchymal
phenotype,the mechanisms of EMTinduction and progression vary
dramatically from one setting to another. The EMTs associatedwith
implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development(type 1 EMTs)
are driven by the evolutionary need to remodel and diversify tissue
in order to enable proper morphogenesis and generate a functional
organism. Such EMTs occur transiently and are not associated with
inflammation, fibrosis, and systemic dissemination. Type 2 EMTs
are associatedwith tissue regeneration and fibrosis, and they depend
oninflammation-inducing injuriesfortheirinitiation and continued
occurrence.Accordingly,these EMTs continue to occur untilthe pro￾voking injuries orinfections are removed and, in the case of injuries,
the tissue isrepaired. Type 2 EMTs generate activated mesenchymal
cells, notably myofibroblaststhat produce excessive amounts of col￾lagen-rich ECM. Type 3 EMTs occurin the context oftumor growth
and cancer progression,when cancer cells atthe invasive front ofthe
tumors convertto a mesenchymal phenotype. The induction oftype
3 EMTs is facilitated by the genomic alterations acquired by cancer
cells and these EMTs generate cells with invasive properties that
enable them to move into the blood stream and spread systemically
to other organs. Future research will surely focus on uncovering the
molecular similarities and differences among the EMT programs
that occurin the three distinctsettings.
EMT research in the next few years promises to be exciting, as
new mouse models and molecular probes are identified to address
important, still-unanswered questions. For example, what are the
identities ofthe EMT-inducing microenvironmentalsignals? What
isthe nature of the changesin cellsthat render them responsive to
such signals? And whatsignaling machinery within epithelial cells
orchestrates the various EMT programs?
