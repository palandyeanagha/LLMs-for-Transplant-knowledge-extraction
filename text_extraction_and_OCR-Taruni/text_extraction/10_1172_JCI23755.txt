Biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a ubiquitous ECM component; however, its biological role has
not been elucidated in detail. Here we show that biglycan acts in macrophages as an endogenous ligand of
TLR4 and TLR2, which mediate innate immunity, leading to rapid activation of p38, ERK, and NF-κB and
thereby stimulating the expression of TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein–2 (MIP-2).In agreement,
the stimulatory effects of biglycan are significantly reduced in TLR4-mutant (TLR4-M), TLR2–/–, and myeloid 
differentiation factor 88–/– (MyD88–/–) macrophages and completely abolished in TLR2–/–/TLR4-M macrophages.
Biglycan-null mice have a considerable survival benefit in LPS- or zymosan-induced sepsis due to lower levels
of circulating TNF-α and reduced infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung, which cause less end-organ
damage. Importantly, when stimulated by LPS-induced proinflammatory factors, macrophages themselves
are able to synthesize biglycan. Thus, biglycan, upon release from the ECM or from macrophages, can boost
inflammation by signaling through TLR4 and TLR2, thereby enhancing the synthesis of TNF-α and MIP-2.
Our results provide evidence for what is, to our knowledge, a novel role of the matrix component biglycan as
a signaling molecule and a crucial proinflammatory factor. These findings are potentially relevant for the
development of new strategies in the treatment of sepsis.
Introduction
Biglycan (BGN), a member of the family of small leucine-rich pro￾teoglycans (SLRPs), consists of a core protein and a chondroitin/
dermatan sulfate chain(s) (1). Although it is abundant in many
tissues, its biological functionsremain poorly understood. BGN is
considered to have an organizing role in the assembly of the ECM.
Targeted disruption of the BGN gene resultsin abnormal collagen
fibril morphology (2) and an osteoporosis-like phenotype (3). BGN
is also directly involved in cell signaling. By regulating the interac￾tion of bone morphogenic protein-4 with its inhibitor chordin, it
modulates signaling of this morphogen (4). Furthermore, BGN
may affect signal transduction during cell growth and differentia￾tion via induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1
(5). BGN-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 signaling increases
migration of lung fibroblasts (6). Moreover, adenovirus-mediated
gene transfer of BGN induced a fibroblastic response in the lung,
indicating a role of BGN in fibrogenesis (7).
There is growing evidence that ECM molecules may convey pro￾inflammatory signals (8–13). Previously, we reported increased
expression of BGN in renal inflammation, associated with heavy
infiltration of BGN-expressing macrophages (14). More recent
data indicated that BGN expression is regulated by nitric oxide in
monocyte-like mesangial cells (15). Based on its capacity to bind
TGF-β (16) and TNF-α (17), BGN may be involved in regulating
cytokine activity. BGN seemsto be required for growth and differ￾entiation of monocytic-lineage cells(18). Like other gene products
involved in pathogen recognition (TLRs,resistance genesin plants,
CD14, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins) (19,
20), the BGN core protein containsleucine-rich repeatsthat facili￾tate protein-protein interactions (1). Recently, binding of BGN to
the scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) and the endocytic mannose
receptor (21, 22), 2 pattern recognition receptors on macrophages
(23), has been reported. Therefore, we investigated whether BGN
is part of the innate immune system and a potential innate antigen
analogous to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
TLRs are seminal immune receptors that are capable of sensing
PAMPs of organismsranging from protozoa to bacteria, fungi, and
viruses (24, 25). The inflammatory response of macrophages to
LPS is mediated mainly by a receptor complex composed of TLR4,
CD14, and myeloid differentiation protein–2 (MD-2) (24, 26–28),
which is critically important in innate immune recognition of
Gram-negative pathogens. TLR2 participates in the recognition
of Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan, and yeast zymosan (24).
Although TLR4 and TLR2 are highly specific in their pathogen

recognition and activation of signal transduction, they share a
common signaling pathway (20, 24) involving an intracellular
adapter protein called myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)
(29), rapid phosphorylation of ERK (30) and p38 (31), and rapid
downstream activation of NF-κB (32), which lead to the expression
of TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein–2 (MIP-2) (20).
Here we demonstrate that biglycan-null (Bgn-null) mice have a
considerable survival benefit in LPS- or zymosan-induced sepsis,
due to lower levels of circulating TNF-α and reduced infiltration
of mononuclear cells in the lungs. In macrophages, BGN induced
signaling through TLR4 and TLR2, leading to rapid activation
of p38, ERK, and NF-κB and finally to a pronounced expression
of TNF-α and MIP-2. This study provides evidence that BGN is a
secretory product of macrophagesthat can act as a “danger” motif
analogous to PAMPs, exerting proinflammatory functions by sig￾naling through TLR4 and TLR2.
Results
Improved survival of Bgn-deficient mice in LPS-induced sepsis. To inves￾tigate the influence of BGN on systemic inflammation, sepsis was
induced in female Bgn+/+, Bgn+/–, and Bgn–/– mice and in male Bgn+/0
and Bgn–/0 mice by i.p. injection of LPS. On average, 8-week-old
Bgn+/0 mice died at 30 ± 8 hours after injection, while Bgn–/0 ani￾malssurvived for 95 ± 19 hours(n = 6, P < 0.05) (Figure 1A). Ninety
minutes after injection of LPS, plasma TNF-α levels were 6 times
lower in Bgn–/0 mice than in WT animals, while Bgn–/0 and Bgn+/0
mice not treated with LPS had identical plasma levels of TNF-α
(Figure 1B). Similarly, female Bgn+/+ mice died much earlier (20 ± 2
hours, n = 7) than Bgn–/– mice (127 ± 39 h, n = 5, P < 0.05), of which
2 animals even survived the treatment(Figure 1C). Again, improved
survival was associated with lower plasma levels of TNF-α (Figure
1D). However, Bgn+/– mice had no survival benefit (23 ± 2 hours,
n = 7, P > 0.05) (Figure 1C), and TNF-α plasma levels were not sig￾nificantly different from those in Bgn+/+ mice (Figure 1D). Thus, a
lack of BGN prolongs survival of septic animals, probably by tem￾pering the inflammatory cytokine response to endotoxin.
Increased expression of BGN attracts infiltrating cells to the lung paren￾chyma in sepsis. To test whether BGN expression increases during
septic inflammation in the lung, a major target organ in sepsis,
Bgn+/0 mice were injected with a lethal dose of LPS. BGN mRNA
(1.7 ± 0.2 times control, n = 3, P < 0.05, 2 hours of sepsis) (Figure
2A) and protein (1.6 ± 0.3 times control, n = 4, P < 0.05, 8 hours
of sepsis) (Figure 2B) were increased in septic lungs compared
with lungs from healthy mice. Immunostaining (Figure 2, C and
D) and in situ hybridization confirmed these results and revealed
macrophages as a source of BGN protein (Figure 2E) and mRNA
expression (Figure 2F) in septic lungs. We previously demonstrat￾ed an association of increased expression of BGN with enhanced
infiltration of mononuclear cells (14). Therefore, absence of
BGN might reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in septic lungs.
Indeed, we found significantly fewer infiltrating mononuclear
cellsin the lungs ofseptic Bgn–/0 (Figure 2H) compared with Bgn+/0
mice (Figure 2G), as quantified by H&E staining and by F4/80
immunostaining (Table 1). The improved outcome of sepsis in
Bgn–/0 mice cannot be attributed to a compensatory overexpression
of decorin orfibromodulin in these animals(33), asimmunostain￾ings for SLRPs both in the lung and in the liver revealed no differ￾encesfrom those in WT mice (data notshown). Furthermore, type
I collagen (Figure 2, I and J), fibronectin (Figure 2K), laminin (Fig￾ure 2L), and type VI collagen (not shown), all known to augment
the adhesiveness of leukocytes (34, 35), were equally increased in
septic lungs from Bgn+/0 and Bgn–/0 mice.
LPS-triggered IL-1β and IL-6 lead to BGN expression, and BGN induces 
TNF-α and MIP-2 in macrophages. Given that BGN was increased in
LPS-septic lungs and macrophages acted as a source of BGN, we
investigated whether BGN is produced by macrophages only dur￾ing infection, and ifso, whatstimuli would trigger itssynthesis. As
the BGN promoterregion contains an IL-6–responsive element(36),
we hypothesized that LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines
may trigger BGN expression. LPS stimulation (1 hour) resulted in
an equal increase of IL-6 (Figure 3A) and IL-1β (Figure 3B) levels
in culture media from both Bgn+/0 and Bgn–/0 thioglycollate-elic￾ited peritoneal macrophages. Unstimulated macrophages did not
express BGN mRNA (Figure 3C) or protein (Figure 3D). However,
upon stimulation with IL-1β or IL-6, WT macrophages expressed
BGN mRNA (Figure 3C) and secreted BGN protein (Figure 3D).
As the rise in circulating TNF-α was blunted in septic Bgn-defi￾cient mice, we subsequently investigated whether BGN influences
the expression of TNF-α and MIP-2. Incubation of peritoneal mac￾rophages from Bgn+/0 and Bgn–/0 mice with BGN for 6 hours led to
increased mRNA levels of TNF-α (Bgn+/0 plus BGN: 5.5 ± 0.6 times
Bgn+/0; Bgn–/0 plus BGN: 3.3 ± 0.4 times Bgn–/0; n = 3, P < 0.05) and

MIP-2 (Bgn+/0 plus BGN: 3.3 ± 0.6 times Bgn+/0; Bgn–/0 plus BGN:
1.9 ± 0.2 times Bgn–/0; n = 3, P < 0.05) (Figure 3E). When macro￾phagesfrom Bgn+/0 and Bgn–/0 mice were cultured for 2–24 hoursin
the presence or absence of BGN, we found dose-dependent (Figure
3, F and G) and time-dependent increases of secreted (shown for
TNF-α in Figure 3H) as well as cellular TNF-α and MIP-2 (TNF-α:
1.6 ± 0.4 times control [without BGN], n = 5, P < 0.05; MIP-2: 23 ± 11
times control [without BGN], n = 3, P < 0.05 after incubation of
Bgn+/0 macrophages with 10 µg/ml BGN for 24 hours). BGN-medi￾ated increases of TNF-α and MIP-2 expression and secretion (Fig￾ure 3, E–H) appeared to be slightly (though notsignificantly) lower
in Bgn–/0 than in Bgn+/0 macrophages, possibly because of binding
of the exogenously added BGN to additional binding sites that
are partially occupied by endogenous BGN in Bgn+/0 macrophages.
Importantly, though the LPS-mediated increases of TNF-α and
MIP-2 expression and secretion (Figure 3, I and J) were signifi￾cantly lower in Bgn–/0 than in Bgn+/0 macrophages, the differences
were not as pronounced as in the in vivo situation (Figure 1B).
Thus, it appearsthat in isolated macrophages LPS initially triggers
IL-1β and IL-6 expression, which then leads to BGN expression
with a subsequent induction of TNF-α and MIP-2. Under in vivo
conditions, LPS effects may be further aggravated by liberation of
BGN from the ECM (due to the activity of proteolytic enzymes in
the course of sepsis), further enhancing the induction of TNF-α
and MIP-2 expression in macrophages. Data confirming the
specificity and requirement of the intact and soluble BGN mol￾ecule for induction of macrophages are shown in Supplemental
Figure 1 (supplemental material available online with this article;

lates TNF-α and MIP-2 expression in macrophages were explored.
Within 10 minutes of incubation, BGN enhanced phosphoryla￾tion of ERK (3.5 ± 0.6 times control without BGN, n = 3, P < 0.05)
and p38 (2.4 ± 0.5 times control, n = 3, P < 0.05) in thioglycol￾late-stimulated Bgn+/0 macrophages, reaching a maximum after
30 minutes (p-ERK/ERK: 5.1 ± 0.4 times control without BGN;
p-p38/p38: 3.5 ± 0.6 times control without BGN; each n = 3,
P < 0.05) with a return to normal levels within 120 minutes (Fig￾ure 4A). Preincubation of macrophages for 1 hour with U0126, a
specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and
2 (MEK1/2), completely abolished ERK phosphorylation (Figure
4B) after 30 minutes. Furthermore, both U0126 and SB203580, an
inhibitor of p38 phosphorylation, caused a significant reduction
of BGN-induced secretion of TNF-α and MIP-2 into the culture
media from BGN-stimulated macrophages after 6 hours(Figure 4,
C and D). Finally, enhanced activation of NF-κB after 30 minutes
of incubation with BGN was shown by electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA) (Figure 4E). Taken together, these resultsshow
that the BGN-dependent induction of TNF-α and MIP-2 in mac￾rophages involves the ERK, p38, and NF-κB pathways.
BGN signals through TLR4 and TLR2 in macrophages. The effect
of BGN on HEK293 cells, which functionally expressed human
TLR2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, or -9 and an alkaline phosphatase gene
under control of the IL-12p40 promoter, was tested. When 10
µg/ml BGN was used, only activation of TLR2 and TLR4 was
observed (Figure 5A). A dose-response analysis showed that 10
µg/ml BGN stimulates TLR4 (Figure 5B) and TLR2 (Figure 5C) to
the same extent that 10 ng/ml FSL-1 stimulates TLR2 or 1 ng/ml
LPS-K12 stimulates TLR4.
Preincubation of macrophages from Bgn+/0 and Bgn–/0 mice with
blocking anti-TLR4 antibodies significantly reduced the increase
in TNF-α (Bgn+/0, 43% ± 13%; Bgn–/0, 76% ± 14%; percentage of inhi￾bition calculated for the respective sample stimulated with BGN
without blocking antibodies, n = 3, P < 0.05) and MIP-2 levels

P < 0.05) in culture media upon BGN stimulation after 6 hours.
Furthermore, incubation of Bgn–/0 macrophages with intact
human BGN in the presence of a cross-linker and subsequent
immunoprecipitationwith anti-BGN antiserum showed that BGN
coimmunoprecipitates with both TLR4 (Figure 5D) and TLR2
(Figure 5E). Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(ESI/MS/MS) analysis of 2 bands migrating at 42–44 kDa and a
band at 96 kDa of the immunoprecipitate after digestion with
chondroitinase ABC and separation by 1D gel electrophoresis(Fig￾ure 5F) identified human BGN with a probability-based score of
221 (Figure 5G) and a sequence coverage of 13% (Figure 5H) and
mouse TLR4 with a probability-based score of 528 (Figure 5I) and
a sequence coverage of 8% (Figure 5J). Individual ion scores greater
than 46 indicate identity or extensive homology (P < 0.05). Other
significant hits(Figure 5, G and I)represented mainly keratins and
trypsin. Note that band 2 (Figure 5F) was at the limit of detection,
which is probably why TLR2 was not detected by ESI/MS/MS.
By gel filtration we could demonstrate interaction of BGN with
a high–molecular weight complex containing TLR4 and/or TLR2,
MD-2, and CD14 as shown in Supplemental Figure 2.
Effects of BGN on phosphorylation of ERK and p38 were test￾ed after 30 minutes in macrophages from WT (C57BL/6) mice,
TLR2–/– mice, C3H/HeJ mice hyporesponsive to LPS because of
a point mutation in the TLR4 gene (TLR4-M) (26, 37), TLR2–/–/
TLR4-M mice, and MyD88–/– mice (shown for ERK in Figure 6A).
Deficiency in either TLR2 or MyD88 as well as mutation in TLR4
markedly diminished BGN-mediated phosphorylation of ERK,
while functional lack of both TLRs completely abolished phos￾phorylation (Figure 6B). These data provide evidence for differ￾ential signaling between BGN (4 µg/ml) and LPS (2 ng/ml), since
LPS-mediated signaling was completely abolished in TLR4-M
macrophages whereas BGN was still able to increase phosphory￾lation of ERK via TLR2 (Figure 6, A and B). Another difference
was observed in MyD88–/– macrophages, where BGN-mediated
phosphorylation of ERK was strongly reduced (Figure 6, A and
B), while LPS could still stimulate ERK via a MyD88-indepen￾dent pathway (Figure 6A; WT plus LPS: 5.4 ± 0.8 times control
without LPS; MyD88–/– plus LPS: 3.8 ± 0.5 times control without
LPS; each n = 3, P < 0.05). In agreement with this signaling pat￾tern, BGN-induced increases in the levels of secreted TNF-α and
MIP-2 were slightly reduced in TLR2–/–, markedly decreased in
TLR4-M and MyD88–/–, and completely abrogated in TLR2–/–/
TLR4-M macrophages (Figure 6, C and D). Finally, BGN-mediated
activation of NF-κB was detected by EMSA in HEK293 cellstrans￾fected with human TLR4/MD-2/CD14 (Figure 6E). These data
suggest that BGN is signaling in macrophages mainly through
TLR4 in a MyD88-dependent manner, causing activation of
NF-κB and MAPKs. Besides TLR4, TLR2 is also involved in BGN￾mediated signaling in macrophages.
To ensure that activation of macrophages by BGN was not
attributable to contamination of the BGN preparation, we care￾fully ruled out the presence of LPS, other proinflammatory fac￾tors, and other TLR4 and TLR2 ligands (Supplemental Figure 3).
Since in TLR2–/–/TLR4-M macrophages an inflammatory
response to BGN was completely abolished, the role of alternative
receptors is very unlikely. However, as interactions of BGN with
the SR-A type I (SR-AI) and the endocytic mannose receptor have

been reported (21, 22), we excluded a role of these receptors in
BGN signaling (Supplemental Figure 4).
Prolonged survival of Bgn-deficient mice in zymosan-induced sepsis but 
not in T cell–mediated lethal shock triggered by the superantigen staphylo￾coccal enterotoxin B. To test whether TLR2-mediated activation of
macrophages is relevant in vivo, zymosan-induced sepsis (38) was
evaluated in Bgn–/0 and Bgn+/0 mice. Bgn–/0 mice revealed improved
survival (Figure 7A), lower plasma levels of TNF-α (Figure 7B), and
a reduced number of H&E- and F4/80–positive infiltrating cells
in septic lungs (Table 1). Finally, we induced a lethal shock syn￾drome triggered by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in Bgn–/0
and Bgn+/0 mice sensitized by d-galactosamine hydrochloride.
The basic differences between this model and LPS- or zymosan￾induced sepsis are that SEB triggers activation of T lymphocytes,
not macrophages, and that this model does not involve TLRs(39).
In this model,survival (Figure 7C), plasma levels of TNF-α (Figure
7D), and the number of infiltrating mononuclear cellsin the lungs
(Bgn+/0, 3.6 ± 0.5; Bgn–/0, 3.9 ± 0.9; Bgn+/0 plus SEB, 4.8 ± 1.5; Bgn–/0
plus SEB, 3.8 ± 0.5; H&E, n = 4, P > 0.05) did not differ between
Bgn–/0 and Bgn+/0 mice. Thus, these data provide further evidence
for a role of macrophages and TLR4 and TLR2 in BGN-associated
inflammatory processes.
Discussion
In the present studies, we have identified a new role of BGN as
a crucial proinflammatory factor. The most convincing evidence
for the biological relevance of this finding is the observation that
Bgn-null mice have a considerable survival benefit compared
with WT animals, both in LPS-induced and in zymosan-induced
sepsis, due to a mitigated inflammatory response that results in
less end-organ damage. This survival benefit in Bgn-null mice is
probably due to the fact that the initialsequence of inflammatory

events, namely PAMP-triggered expression of proinflammatory
factors such as IL-1β and IL-6, subsequent IL-1β/IL-6–induced
expression of BGN in macrophages, and finally BGN-induced
expression of TNF-α, is interrupted in the absence of BGN. The
relevance of this interpretation of our data is underscored by the
observation that the increased secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 as an
initial response to LPS is indistinguishable in Bgn-deficient and
WT macrophages, while the subsequent TNF-α production issig￾nificantly reduced in the Bgn-deficient macrophages because of
the lack of costimulatory effects of BGN. Regulation of TNF-α
by BGN has not been reported previously, although in lung fibro￾blasts TNF-α has been proven to induce the expression of BGN
(40). Since the initial release of TNF-α is of critical importance
for the outcome of sepsis, therapeutic strategies to neutralize this
cytokine have been developed, but no clear-cut survival benefits
have been achieved so far (41). This study demonstrates that in
the early stages of sepsis, serum levels of TNF-α are considerably
lower in Bgn-deficient than in WT mice.
The importance of BGN during sepsis is underlined by the fact
that BGN overexpression could be observed in septic lungs, at
both mRNA and protein levels. Early upregulation of BGN in pul￾monary inflammation has already been reported (42, 43); however,
its biologicalrelevance remained unclear. We previously observed a
striking concurrence of BGN overexpression and enhanced num￾bers of infiltrating cells in a model of renal inflammation (14).
In the present study we confirmed this relationship in the lung
and addressed the potential mechanism in vitro by showing that
BGN, besides TNF-α, induces the expression of MIP-2, a potent
chemoattractant of infiltrating cells (44). Enhanced numbers of
macrophages were in fact triggered by BGN,since other ECM com￾ponents,such asfibronectin, laminin, and typesI and VI collagen,
which could potentially increase monocyte sticking (34, 35), were
upregulated to the same extent in lungs from septic Bgn+/0 and
Bgn–/0 mice. BGN regulates lung fibroblast migration via stimula￾tion of the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 (6). Interestingly, both
the Rho proteins and the p38 MAPK pathways have been shown
to be important mediators of LPS-induced expression of IL-8, a
human MIP-2 homolog, in human endothelial cells (45).
It is particularly noteworthy that macrophages, seminal cells of
the innate immune system (24), are capable of producing BGN
upon stimulation by proinflammatory factors. Previously, we
have shown that macrophages do contain and secrete BGN in a

model of renal inflammation (14). A recent study reported BGN
in association with macrophages in human gingiva (46). In the
present investigation, we found that unstimulated peritoneal
macrophages do not express BGN. However, once activated by
IL-6 and IL-1β, macrophages start to express BGN mRNA and
secrete the proteoglycan into the culture medium. Although the
presence of an IL-6–responsive element in the BGN promoter
region has been reported (36), the IL-1β– and IL-6–triggered
expression of BGN in macrophages is, to our knowledge, a novel
finding. The fact that macrophages produce BGN only upon
inflammatory stimulation underlines the biological importance
of this proteoglycan in terms of its influence on inflammation.
As only soluble BGN is active in stimulating macrophages, pre￾sumably because in the immobilized state the binding sites for
macrophage receptors are inaccessible because of binding of BGN
to other ECM components, we suggest that regulation is achieved
via the amount of BGN liberated from immobilized pools by the
activity of proteolytic enzymes in the course of sepsis, rather than
via fine-tuning of BGN expression levels. Thus, only Bgn-null mice
could be seen to have a survival benefit in sepsis, which suggests
that, in heterozygous females, sufficiently high tissue content of
BGN is present to support macrophage activation.
Our data showing that BGN interacts with TLR4 and to a lesser
extent with TLR2, and the subsequent predominantly MyD88-
dependentinduction of ERK, p38, and NF-κB,significantly extend
the knowledge of the biology of BGN for 2 reasons: (a) the data
confirm that BGN acts as a signaling molecule, and (b) they firmly
establish this proteoglycan as an integral part ofthe innate immune
system. Although the involvement of BGN in various signaling
processes has been addressed (4–6, 15, 33), this is, to our knowl￾edge, the first report to provide evidence for BGN-mediated signal
transduction in macrophages, starting from the initial receptors
and describing the downstream signaling events and the inflam￾matory mediatorssubsequently generated. Variousstructural mol￾ecules have been reported to modulate an inflammatory response
reaction (9–13, 47). Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are well
known to act as targets for bacterial, viral, and parasitic virulence
factors for attachment, invasion, and immune evasion (48–50). In
ourstudy, only intact BGN and to a lesser extent the intact decorin
molecule were able to deliver a proinflammatory signal to macro￾phages. Thus, BGN-mediated stimulation of macrophages is not
due to a general effect of GAG chains but was shown to be in fact
BGN-specific.Recentstudies demonstrated that ECM components,
previously only regarded as docking sites for microbial pathogens,
might actively participate in immune defense as an integral part
of the innate immune system (9, 11–13). Among these ECM mol￾ecules, fibronectin extra domain A (11) and hyaluronan-derived
oligosaccharides (9) have been shown to activate TLR4. Our study
provides evidence that the ECM component BGN is also actively
involved in the innate immune response. In contrastto hyaluronan
(9, 13), BGN strongly influences the effector phase of an immune
reaction (e.g., increase in activity of macrophages).
BGN effectively uses the TLR signaling cascade by binding
to both TLR4 and TLR2. Contaminations are unlikely to have
caused the effects. Apart from the neutralizing activity of antibod￾ies directed against BGN, which strongly implicates BGN as the
active component, contaminatory products have been excluded
by several assays as outlined in the supplemental material. Most
importantly, our data show a clear survival benefit of Bgn-null
mice in TLR4- and TLR2-dependent models of sepsis but not in
SEB-mediated shock, where T lymphocytes and not macrophages
are triggered in a TLR-independent way (39). Further evidence
for BGN-specific TLR4- and TLR2-mediated proinflammatory
effects is provided by the observation that BGN and LPS signal
differently in TLR4-M and MyD88–/– macrophages. The fact that
BGN-induced signaling in macrophagesis mediated by 2 receptors
important in the recognition of both Gram-negative (26–28, 37)
and Gram-positive pathogens (24) emphasizes the key role of this
proteoglycan within the innate immune system.
In summary, our results demonstrate the biological relevance
of BGN in a prototypical innate immune process such as sepsis
and identify a novel role of BGN as a crucial proinflammatory fac￾tor. Being ubiquitously present in the ECM, BGN can be liberated
during inflammation by proteolytic enzymes, or alternatively be
induced in macrophages by PAMP-triggered cytokines, to signal
through the classical PAMP receptors TLR4 and TLR2. Subse￾quent expression of TNF-α and MIP-2 will cause recruitment of
more macrophages, which also willstart to produce BGN, creating
a feed-forward cycle that is able to drive an inflammatory response
forward in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner.
Methods
Mice. Female Bgn–/– and Bgn–/+ and male Bgn–/0, Bgn+/+, and Bgn+/0 mice
(C57BL/6) have been previously described (3). Since the Bgn gene islocated
on the X chromosome, male animals have only 1 allele. TLR4-M mice with a
TLR4 gene point mutation (C3H/HeJ) (26, 37) and TLR4 WT strains(C3H/
HeN) were from Charles River Laboratories. TLR2–/– and TLR4–/– mice were
kindly provided by M. Freudenberg (Max Planck Institute forImmunology,
Freiburg, Germany), TLR4-M/TLR2–/– mice by C.J. Kirschning (Institute of
Medical Microbiology, Immunology, and Hygiene, Technical University of
Munich, Munich, Germany), and MyD88–/– mice by S. Akira (Osaka Uni￾versity, Osaka, Japan). Sepsis was induced by i.p. injection into 8-week-old
mice of 200 µg/g body weight (µg/g b.wt.) or 45 µg/g b.wt. (sublethal dose)

of LPS from Salmonella minnesota,trichloroacetic acid extracted from S. min￾nesota (Sigma-Aldrich), or ultrapure S. minnesota (InvivoGen). Zymosan A
(Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in 0.9% NaCl as described previously (38) and
endotoxin-tested wasinjected i.p. in a dose of 2 mg/g b.wt. (a lethal dose in
8-week-old Bgn+/0 mice). d-Galactosamine hydrochloride (4 mg/g b.wt. i.p.;
Carl Roth GmbH) and the superantigen SEB (10 µg/g b.wt. in hind foot￾pads; Sigma-Aldrich) were injected simultaneously (39) in 8-week-old Bgn–/0
and Bgn+/0 mice. Mean body weights were not different between groups. All
animal work was done in accordance with the German Animal Protection
Law and was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for laboratory ani￾mals of the District Government of Muenster, Germany.
Cell culture and stimulation. Macrophageswere harvested by peritoneal lavage
5 days afterinjection ofthioglycollate, and cultured inRPMI 1640 (Invitrogen
Corp.) under serum-free conditions. Only adherent cells were used for pri￾mary cultures. Puritywas controlled by flowcytometry and Giemsa staining.
LPS, cell culture–tested, from S. minnesota and peptidoglycan from Staphylo￾coccus aureus were both from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultrapure LPS from S. minnesota 
was from InvivoGen. To control responsiveness, cells from each isolation
were stimulated with LPS (0.1 ng/ml) and/or peptidoglycan (5 µg/ml) for
2 hours and tested for secreted TNF-α. Intact BGN, BGN core protein, or
BGN-derived GAG chains were used in concentrations of 1–10 µg/ml. If it is
notindicated otherwise, experimentswere donewith 4 µg/ml of BGN. When
required, macrophageswere preincubated for 30 minuteswith rat anti–mouse
TLR4 blocking antibodies(40 µg/ml; Imgenex)recognizing the TLR4/MD-2
complex, or for 1 hour with 10 µM of MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126; Cell Sig￾naling Technology) or p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580; Sigma-Aldrich).
Stimulation of macrophages was performed with recombinant mouse IL-1β
(10 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) or human IL-6 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems).
HEK293 cellsstably transfected with pNIFTY2-SEAP vectors containing
human TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 genes (HEK-Blue-4) or human TLR2 and
CD14 genes (TLR2/CD14) and 293/null (control) cells (all from Invivo￾Gen) were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization. Total RNA was
extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen Corp.). Membranes were hybridized
with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for BGN (51), TNF-α (American Type Cul￾ture Collection), and MIP-2 (52). A mouse α-tubulin probe encompassing
bp 365–965 (GenBank accession number M13446), generated by RT-PCR
(53) with the primer pair 5′-AAGGAGGATGCTGCCAATAA-3′ and 5′-
AGAGATCACCAATGCCTGCT-3′, was used to control for equal loading.
Northern blots were performed and quantified as described previously
(53). RT-PCR for BGN and GAPDH and in situ hybridization for BGN
were described previously (51).
Western blotting and ELISA. Western and dot blots were performed and
quantified as described previously (53). The following antibodies were
used: rabbit anti–human TLR4 cross-reacting with mouse TLR4, and rab￾bit anti–β-tubulin (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); rabbit anti–
mouse TLR2 and rabbit anti–human TLR2 (both from Imgenex Corp.);
rabbit anti–mouse pan-laminin and rabbit anti–human fibronectin (both
from Sigma-Aldrich); and rabbit antibodies against phosphorylated and
total ERK (Thr202/204) and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) MAPK (all from Cell
Signaling Technology). BGN core protein from murine lungs was semipu￾rified and quantified by dot blotting using LF-106, a rabbit anti–murine
BGN antiserum kindly provided by L.W. Fisher (National Institute of Den￾tal and Craniofacial Research) (54), as described previously (53). Dot blot
results were confirmed by Western blotting and standardized to the con￾tent of β-tubulin in the samples before purification. TNF-α, MIP-2, IL-6,
and IL-1β were measured in plasma, culture media, and homogenates of
macrophages by mouse-specific ELISAs (R&D Systems). Results were nor￾malized by protein content and cell number. All assays were performed in
duplicate, and each experiment was carried out at least 3 times.
Activation of TLRs by BGN. BGN-induced stimulation via TLR2, -3, -4, -5,
-7, -8, or -9 was tested in HEK293 cells expressing only 1 type of TLR and
secreted alkaline phosphatase under the control of a modified human
IL-12p40 promoterinducible by NF-κB, activator protein–1, and IFN-regu￾latory factors cloned into pNIFTY2-SEAP vectors. The amount ofsecreted
alkaline phosphatase was determined using the SEAP Reporter Assay Kit
(measurements were performed by TLR screening service of InvivoGen)
and is given as arbitrary units. Screening was performed (in duplicate) by
challenge ofthe 7 TLR cloneswith 10 µg/ml of BGN and comparison ofthe
induced alkaline phosphatase activity to that of negative controls (respec￾tive noninduced TLR clones) and that of positive controlsstimulated with
the following ligands: FSL-1 (10 ng/ml) for TLR2, poly I:C (10 µg/ml) for
TLR3, LPS-K12 (10 and 1 ng/ml) for TLR4, flagellin (100 ng/ml) for TLR5,
R848 (1 µg/ml) for TLR7 and -8, and ODN 2006 (10 µg/ml) for TLR9
(Invivo­Gen). Dose-response analysis was performed (in triplicate) using
BGN (10 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, 0.1 µg/ml) on the respective TLR cell lines.
Immunoprecipitation and protein identification by ESI/MS/MS.
Immunoprecipitation of human BGN was performed as described previ￾ously (55) with some modifications. Thioglycollate-elicited Bgn–/0, TLR2–/–,
or TLR4–/– macrophages (107 cells) or HEK-Blue-4, TLR2/CD14, and 293/
null cells were incubated with 8 µg of intact human BGN for 2 hours at 4°C
and then with 1 mM 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfo-succinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP;
Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) for cross-linking of BGN to binding proteins.
Cellswere harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer, and a com￾plex of normalrabbitserum bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added for 6 hoursto remove nonspecifically precipitated proteins. Then
10 µg of rabbit anti–human BGN (55) was added, and after 16 hours the
immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. As control,
a similar amount of protein A-Sepharose was incubated with the antibody
but without cell lysate. Additional controls included samples incubated
without cross-linker and/or without BGN. After washing (3 times in lysis
buffer,twice in PBS), the material containing intact BGN was divided into 2
aliquots. One aliquotwastreatedwith chondroitinase ABC. Bound proteins
were eluted by boiling in the respective sample buffer (55). Some immuno￾precipitations for BGN were performed using rabbit IgG TrueBlot (eBiosci￾ence) according to the manufacturer’ssuggestion. Sampleswere examined by
Western blotting forthe presence ofTLR4 and BGN, using BGNcore protein
and homogenates of TLR2–/– and TLR4–/– macrophages, HEK-Blue-4, TLR2/
CD14, and 293/null cells as positive or negative controls. Afterseparation by
1D SDS gel electrophoresis, identification of human BGN and mouse TLR4
by proteomicsservice (MS-ESI-PROTID; Eurogentec) using ESI/MS/MSwas
performed in Bgn–/0 macrophagesincubatedwith BGN, immunoprecipitated
for BGN, and digested with chondroitinase ABC. Results were analyzed by a
Mascot database search (Matrix Science Ltd.).
Morphology and immunohistochemistry. Formaldehyde- or zinc-fixed and par￾affin-embedded lung tissue sections were stained for matrix antigens and
mononuclear cells by immunoperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase, anti–alkaline
phosphatase, orstreptavidin/biotin–alkaline phosphatase techniques(51, 52).
Primary antibodiesincluded LF-113, a rabbit anti–murine decorin antiserum
(54), LF-106 (1:500), rabbit anti–mouse fibromodulin (1:100) (33), rabbit
anti–rat type I collagen (1:50; Quartett GmbH), rabbit anti–human fibro￾nectin (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich), biotinylated goat anti–type VI collagen (1:20;
Southern Biotechnology AssociatesInc.), and, for populations of monocytes/
macrophages,rat anti-mouse F4/80 (1:2,000; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen).
Double-immunostaining forBGN(chicken anti–ratBGN)(51) and F4/80was
performed as described previously (56). Immunolabeled and H&E-stained
mononuclear cellswere counted by a blinded observerin 15 high-powerfields
(×400) persection and recorded as mean per high-powerfield.
Other procedures. Expression of human BGN and decorin in HEK293 cells
and purification of the native proteoglycans were described previously

(33, 57). Potential contamination of BGN preparations was ruled out as
described in the supplemental material.
Nuclear extraction was performed with NucBuster Protein Extraction
Kit (EMD BiosciencesInc.) and analyzed by EMSA. Briefly, 2.5 µg of nucle￾ar protein wasincubated with 40 kcpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide cod￾ing for the region of interest. Reactions were incubated for 45 minutes
on ice. For oligonucleotide competition, 20 ng of specific oligonucleotide
competitor was added prior to the probe. Oligonucleotide sequences for
consensus or mutant DNA-binding domains were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (NF-κB/sc2505/sc2511).
Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay
Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.).
Statistics. Data are given as means ± SD analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, with
Dunnett’s significance correction test (SPSS 13.0; SPSS Inc.). Differences
were considered significant at a P value of less than 0.05.
