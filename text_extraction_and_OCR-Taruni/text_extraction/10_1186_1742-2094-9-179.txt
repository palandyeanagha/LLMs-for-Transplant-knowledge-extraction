Abstract
Background: This study undertakes a systematic and comprehensive analysis of brain gene expression profiles of
immune/inflammation-related genes in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Methods: In a well-powered microarray study of young (20 to 59 years), aged (60 to 99 years), and AD (74 to
95 years) cases, gene responses were assessed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and
post-central gyrus.
Results: Several novel concepts emerge. First, immune/inflammation-related genes showed major changes in gene
expression over the course of cognitively normal aging, with the extent of gene response far greater in aging than
in AD. Of the 759 immune-related probesets interrogated on the microarray, approximately 40% were significantly
altered in the SFG, PCG and HC with increasing age, with the majority upregulated (64 to 86%). In contrast, far
fewer immune/inflammation genes were significantly changed in the transition to AD (approximately 6% of
immune-related probesets), with gene responses primarily restricted to the SFG and HC. Second, relatively few
significant changes in immune/inflammation genes were detected in the EC either in aging or AD, although many
genes in the EC showed similar trends in responses as in the other brain regions. Third, immune/inflammation
genes undergo gender-specific patterns of response in aging and AD, with the most pronounced differences
emerging in aging. Finally, there was widespread upregulation of genes reflecting activation of microglia and
perivascular macrophages in the aging brain, coupled with a downregulation of select factors (TOLLIP, fractalkine)
that when present curtail microglial/macrophage activation. Notably, essentially all pathways of the innate immune
system were upregulated in aging, including numerous complement components, genes involved in toll-like
receptor signaling and inflammasome signaling, as well as genes coding for immunoglobulin (Fc) receptors and
human leukocyte antigens I and II.

Conclusions: Unexpectedly, the extent of innate immune gene upregulation in AD was modest relative to the
robust response apparent in the aged brain, consistent with the emerging idea of a critical involvement of
inflammation in the earliest stages, perhaps even in the preclinical stage, of AD. Ultimately, our data suggest that an
important strategy to maintain cognitive health and resilience involves reducing chronic innate immune activation
that should be initiated in late midlife.

Background
The role of inflammation in brain health is a major focal
point of contemporary research in aging and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) [1-4], and activation of inflammatory path￾ways in the brain is increasingly emphasized as a major risk
factor for the development and progression of AD [2,5,6].
Consistent with the idea that activation of the immune sys￾tem in the brain is harmful, the majority of recent studies
in transgenic mouse models of AD support the notion that
immune activation can precipitate the onset of AD-like
pathology [5-10] (but see [11-13]). In addition, epidemio￾logical studies in humans suggest that long-term use of
anti-inflammatory drugs during adult life protects brain
function and delays the onset of cognitive decline [5,14,15],
with animal studies providing additional support for this
hypothesis [16-18]. In contrast, clinical studies attempting
to treat AD with anti-inflammatory drugs once the disease
is clinically apparent have been largely unsuccessful [19-
22]. Taken together, these studies suggest that the timing
of anti-inflammatory treatment is crucial, and that attenu￾ation of inflammation is particularly important prior to
clinical manifestation of AD.
While immune activation in the brain is an accepted part
of AD pathogenesis, it has generally been assumed that
such neuroinflammation is minimal in cognitively normal
aging. However, the findings that amyloid-beta (Aβ) depos￾its are associated with inflammatory proteins and microglia
in the early stages of AD pathology [2,23,24]), coupled with
the recent data that volume density of microglia is
increased already in cognitively normal subjects who have
frequent presence of plagues and tangles [24,25], has led to
the hypothesis that there may be critical involvement of in￾flammation already in the preclinical stages of AD [26,27].
Further, our recent data suggest that neuroinflammation is
present in the brain well prior to cognitive decline. Using
microarray analysis to identify functional classes of genes
showing altered expression in cognitively normal aging
across the adult lifespan (age 20 to 99 years), we found that
immune activation is a highly prominent feature of
cognitively normal brain aging [28]. If immune and
inflammation-related genes are activated in the brain
in the course of cognitively normal aging, it is pos￾sible that such neuroinflammation primes the brain for
neurodegenerative cascades, cognitive decline, and pro￾gression to AD [29-31].
The extent to which immune/inflammation-related
genes are activated in the brain in normal aging or AD
has not been examined in a comprehensive manner.
Thus, this study undertakes a systematic and compre￾hensive analysis of gene expression profiles of this class
of genes in a well-powered microarray study of young,
aged, and AD cases to address a number of questions. In
particular, do immune and inflammation-related genes
undergo a progressive preclinical activation in aging or
undergo a precipitous upregulation in AD? What are
the response profiles of genes involved in the innate
immune response, such as the complement pathway,
toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, inflammasome activa￾tion, and other markers indicative of microglial activa￾tion, and how do these response profiles compare in
aging and AD? Are there gender differences in the
responses of immune/inflammation genes in aging or
AD? Finally, because brain regions are differentially
vulnerable to accumulating pathology in aging and AD,
we examined gene expression profiles of immune/in￾flammation genes in four brain regions. Three of these
regions, the hippocampus (HC), entorhinal cortex (EC),
superior frontal gyrus (SFG), are critical for higher cog￾nitive function and develop AD-type neuropathology,
with associated functional declines, in both aging and
AD. In contrast, the fourth brain region, the post-central
gyrus (PCG) is a somatosensory cortical region that
appears to be relatively refractory to developing path￾ology. Our study is the first to use the microarray
approach to evaluate gene expression changes in immune/
inflammation-related genes in relationship to age, gender,
brain region, and the development of AD, and provides a
detailed focus on key sets of inflammatory genes associated
with the innate immune response.
Materials and methods
Case selection, group classification, and brain
region designation
Frozen unfixed tissue was obtained from 57 neurologic￾ally and cognitively normal controls (age 20 to 99 years)
and from 26 Alzheimer’s disease cases (age 74 to
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 2 of 18

95 years) using tissue banked at seven well-established
National Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Center
(ADC) brain banks located at the University of Califor￾nia, Irvine, Sun Health Research Institute, University of
Rochester, Johns Hopkins University, University of
Maryland, University of Pennsylvania, and the University
of Southern California. Tissue was obtained from four
brain regions: the entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus
(HC), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and post-central
gyrus (PCG), using the landmarks described previously
to standardize dissection of the four brain regions [28].
Tissue was available from two or more regions from
85% of the cases, resulting in a total of 240 tissue sam￾ples (50 EC, 64 HC, 64 PCG, 62 SFG). Group sizes were
as follows: young (n = 22, 20 to 59 years, mean age
35.4 ± 10.5 years), aged controls (n = 33, age 69 to 99,
mean age 84.2 ± 8.9 years), and AD cases (n = 26, ages 74
to 95 years, mean age 85.7 ± 6.5 years) with males and
females similarly represented in each group. Individual
case details are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Clinical and neuropathological criteria
Clinical and neuropathological data were available for all
cases aged 60 to 99. Controls had no memory complaints
or history of memory complaints, with normal cognitive
function documented by scoring within 1.5 standard devia￾tions of the age and education adjusted norms. Mini￾mental status examination (MMSE) scores for controls
ranged from 25 to 30 (average = 28.35 ± 1.57), and global
clinical dementia rating (CDR) = 0 for all cases. AD cases
were characterized by a progressive decline in memory,
cognitive deficits in two or more areas, MMSE< 24 (aver￾age = 18.32 ± 9.19), CDR = 2 to 3, Braak stage II to VI (aver￾age stage IV), and neuropathological diagnosis of AD
based on CERAD and NIA/Reagan Institute criteria.
Clinical exclusion for both controls and AD included
evidence of Alcoholism (DSM-IV or pattern of patho￾logical use), co-existing major psychiatric illness or
major depression (Hamilton depression rating), brain
damage from an earlier known cause (for example, hyp￾oxia, coma, head trauma), cancer with evidence of
metastasis to the brain or wide disease metastasis, or
history of cerebral vascular disease. Neuropathological
exclusion criteria for both controls and AD included the
following: (1) dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s
disease or other non-AD dementias, (2) hippocampal
sclerosis, (3) gross infarcts in excess of 50 ml total or
smaller infarcts in areas of interest, (4) recent or old
intracerebral hemorrhage in excess of 25 ml or sub￾arachnoid hemorrhage exceeding 10 ml, (5) sepsis, men￾ingitis, encephalitis, or pathologic evidence of metabolic
brain disease, anoxia, drug intoxication or alcoholism,
(6) primary or metastatic tumor except for small, inci￾dent meningioma, (7) extensive white matter lesions,
(7) Binswanger's disease or multiple sclerosis. Data enab￾ling exclusion criteria for subject previously taking over￾the-counter or prescription nonsteroidal or steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs were not available.
Tissue processing, gene-chip hybridization,
and quality control
Total RNA was extracted from the frozen, unfixed tissue
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
and purified using quick spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA),
with average RIN = 8.3 ± 0.7 across all samples (Add￾itional file 1: Table S1). Each sample was individually
hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide gene chips
from Affymetrix (Human genome Hg-U133 plus 2.0).
These chips measure the expression of > 50,000 tran￾scripts and variants, including 38,500 characterized
human genes. Gene chips were processed at the Core
Facility at UC Irvine using a robotic system and follow￾ing manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, total RNA
(10 ug) from each sample was used to generate first
strand cDNA using a T7-linked-(dT)24 primer, followed
by in vitro transcription using the ENZO BioArray High￾Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO, Farmingdale,
NY, USA) to generate biotin-labeled cRNA target. Using
a robotics system (Biomek FX MicroArray Plex SA
System; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA. USA) to optimize
consistency in processing and minimize handling vari￾ability, each fragmented, biotin-labeled cRNA sample
(30 ug) was individually hybridized to an Affymetrix Hg￾U133 plus 2.0 chip for 16 hours and rotated at 13 rpm
at 50°C. The chips were washed and stained on a fluidics
station and scanned. After scanning, CEL files were
assessed manually for grid alignment and to ascertain
absence of scratches and bubbles. Quality control on the
chips was assessed using Affymetrix Quality Reporter
software. Background signal, average signal present, per￾centage of probe sets called Present, spike-in controls
BioB and BioC, and housekeeping genes GAPDH (3/5
ratio), HS-HUMISGF3A (3/5 ratio), and HS-HSAC07
(3/5 ratio) were assessed, and only arrays where all qual￾ity control values were within acceptable range (mean ±
1 standard deviation) were included for further analysis.
Microarray analysis
Using GeneSpring 7.3.1 software (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA, USA), expression values for each probe
set were calculated from CEL files using GC-RMA, an
algorithm based on the Robust Multiarray Average
(RMA) software by Irizarry et al.. [32,33]. GC-RMA
takes into consideration the binding efficiency of the
probes based on the guanine and cytosine (GC) contents
of the probes, and incorporates the MisMatch (MM)

feature of Affymetrix microarrays, which is intended
to measure nonspecific binding. This model-based
algorithm incorporates information from multiple micro￾arrays to calculate the expression of a gene. The probe
response pattern is fitted over multiple arrays using an
additive model. The fitted model detects abnormally
behaving probes, which are subsequently excluded for
calculating gene expression. After extracting probe
set raw signal intensity values from gene chip CEL
file, default settings were applied for per-chip and per￾gene normalization, and expression values underwent
log-transformation of the geometric mean followed by
statistical analysis for significant probe sets.
Statistical analysis (GeneSpring)
An initial list of immune- and inflammation-related
genes was generated based on the Gene Ontology cat￾egories ‘defense response (GO:6952)’ (which contains
GO subcategories of inflammatory response, innate
immune response, positive and negative regulation of
the defense response, and defense response to patho￾gens), supplemented by manual curation. 1532 probe
sets on the Affymetrix Hg-U133 plus 2.0 microarray rep￾resent this functional category, which are referred to
as immune/inflammation-related genes in this paper.
To limit the analysis to mRNAs that were present at
levels that were reliably detectable by the microarray,
the immune/inflammation-related probe sets were then
filtered on Flag detection calls to remove probe sets that
were absent on more than 50% of the chips for a given
region, as described previously [28]. This threshold
removes probe sets with unreliable signal and very ef￾fectively reduces the incidence of false positives [34],
and in this case reduced the target list size from 1532
probesets to 759 reliably detectable probe sets related to
immune/inflammation function. These 759 probe sets
were then analyzed for expression changes in aging or
AD, with significance threshold set at P < 0.01 and vari￾ance measures based on the cross-gene error model in
GeneSpring as described previously [28]. The probe sets
and genes interrogated are listed in Additional file 1:
Table S1. Aging-AD continuum genes were identified as
genes for which there was a strong linear relationship be￾tween young, aged, and AD groups, and for which the dir￾ection of change remained consistent across young versus
aged and aged versus AD. A two-step procedure was used,
first identifying immune/inflammation genes for which the
regression across all three comparison groups (young,
aged, AD) was significant with a threshold of P < 0.01. Sec￾ond, using this subset we identified only those genes that
demonstrated a consistent pairwise relationship as defined
by the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding confi￾dence interval for the difference in means for each pairwise
comparison, using 90% confidence limits. The 90%
threshold following linear regression based on P < 0.01
was selected to balance the probability of either type I or
type II errors. Identification of continuum genes was first
based on analysis with gender pooled, followed by analysis
of gender-specific changes in each region.
Select gene lists
Many of the gene changes that emerged in the analysis
of immune/inflammation genes were associated with the
innate immune response. Based on this, we looked in
detail at changes in probe sets related to major comple￾ment pathway elements, toll-like receptors (TLR) and
related molecules, complement pathway elements, caspase￾1 and inflammasome-related genes, modulators of micro￾glial and perivascular macrophage activation, chemokine
ligands and receptors, scavenger and immunoglobulin
receptors, and major histocompatibility classes of genes
(MHCI, MCH II). Gene lists were established by search￾ing the immune/inflammation gene list by keyword for
the relevant functional class, resulting in lists containing
the following: 22 probe sets representing 16 complement￾related genes, 20 probe sets representing 16 TLR￾signaling related genes, 13 probe sets representing 6
genes related to inflammasomes, 14 probe sets represent￾ing 10 chemokine ligands and receptors, 12 probe sets
representing 9 scavenger and immunoglobulin receptors,
20 probesets representing 8 major histocompatibility
class (MHC) I genes, and 19 probesets representing 13
MHC II genes. Only probesets that had a present call
>50% across all microarrays for a given region were
included. Significant changes were identified using a
statistical threshold of P < 0.01. For a complete list of
immune-related probesets interrogated, with correspond￾ing fold changes, please contact the authors.
QPCR validation of age- and AD-associated changes in a
subset of genes identified by gene chip analysis
A subset of inflammation-related genes was further ana￾lyzed by qPCR to validate the age- and AD-related
changes derived from the gene chip studies. The genes
assessed in hippocampal tissue by qPCR were CD14,
TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, TOLLIP (an inhibitor of TLR signal￾ing), MYD88 (a positive modulator of TLR signaling),
and the cytokines TNF alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β),
IL-6, and IL-10 and a GUSB (beta glucuronidase)
endogenous control assay. The sample sizes for PCR
analysis of HC gene expression were based on availabil￾ity of RNA after running the microarrays (young, n = 10;
aged, n = 11; AD, n = 4). Inflammasome-related gene
expression was quantified in SFG tissue based on avail￾ability of RNA after running the microarrays (young,
n = 4; aged, n = 8; AD, n = 11) for NRLP3 and ASC, using
commercially available probes (SABiosciences, Frederick,
MD, USA). Appropriate control genes for the SFG were
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 4 of 18

determined using NormFinder, with the following com￾binations of control genes identified as optimal: cofilin 2
and FBOX42 for the aging analysis, and cofilin 2 and
SLC25a16 for the comparison of AD to age-matched
controls. Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Each TaqMan Gene Expression Assay is
preformulated consisting of an unlabeled forward and
reverse primer at a final concentration of 900 nM and
1 FAM™ dye-labeled TaqMan™ MGB of 250 nM final
concentration. Sequences of the primers and probe are
proprietary information. For each sample, 3.0 ug total
RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Two ml of a 1:5 dilution for cDNA was combined with
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG
(Applied Biosystems) and the TaqMan Gene Expression
Assay in a 10 ml reaction set up by the CAS-1200 liquid
handling system. The real-time qPCR amplifications
were run on an ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detec￾tion System (Applied Biosystems). Universal thermal cyc￾ling conditions were as follows: 10 minutes at 95 degrees
C, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 degrees C for 15 sec￾onds, and annealing and extension at 60 degrees C for 1
minute. Amplifications efficiencies were close to 100%
for all assays according to analyses of a number of differ￾ent dilutions of the cDNA. Calculations were done
assuming that 1 delta Ct equals a two-fold difference
in expression.
Results
Previously, our microarray data from a genome-wide
microarray study investigating gene expression changes
in the brain across the adult lifespan revealed that im￾mune activation is a prominent feature of cognitively
normal aging [28]. The present study builds on this ini￾tial observation to analyze the extent to which gene ex￾pression of 759 immune/inflammation-related probe
sets is altered in the course of aging and AD, in four
brain regions (the HC, EC, SFG and PCG). Of these
brain regions, the HC, EC and SFG are vulnerable to
neuropathology accumulation and functional decline
with age and AD, while the PCG is relatively spared.
Subsequently, we focus on gene responses of key sets
of inflammatory markers associated primarily with the
innate immune response.
More extensive response in aging than AD, with a subset
of genes undergoing progressive change across aging
and AD
To identify the extent to which immune/inflammation￾related genes are affected over the course of aging,
expression levels of the 759 probe sets were compared
in young (age 20 to 59) versus aged controls (60 to 99)
in each of the four target brain regions. This analysis
revealed an unexpectedly large number of significant
transcriptional changes in immune/inflammation-related
genes, with predominant gene upregulation and a
region-specific response profile (Figure 1A). The greatest
number of genes responded in the HC and the cortical
regions (SFG and PCG), with approximately 40% of
interrogated probe sets showing altered expression,
while few immune/inflammation-related genes showed
significant age-related change in the EC. In all brain
regions, the majority of responding immune/inflamma￾tion-related genes was upregulated with age (64 to 84%,
depending on brain region) (Figure 1A).
Changes in immune/inflammation gene expression
were next assessed in AD cases relative to age-matched
controls (P < 0.01), with the prediction that extensive
change would be apparent in the HC, EC, and SFG,
and relatively little in the PCG. Further, we predicted
that more immune/inflammation genes would undergo
transcriptional change in AD than in aging. Contrary
to our predictions, AD was associated with far less
extensive response of immune/inflammation genes
than was observed over the course of aging. Of the 759
immune/inflammation-related probe sets interrogated,
only 6% were significantly altered in AD relative to age￾matched controls (Figure 1B). In addition, gene responses
were primarily detected in the HC and SFG in AD, with
virtually no immune/inflammation genes identified as sig￾nificantly changed in the EC in AD, and similarly
few genes responding in the PCG. Nearly all the sig￾nificant immune/inflammation genes in the SFG were
upregulated in AD, while in the HC, a greater proportion
of significant genes was downregulated (Figure 1B).
A key unknown in the fields of aging and AD is
whether transcriptional changes in immune/inflammation
genes apparent in the AD brain are initiated to some
degree already in aging. To address this possibility, we
evaluated the extent to which immune/inflammation￾related genes in a given region undergo progressive upre￾gulation or downregulation across aging and AD. Linear
regression analysis (P < 0.01) was applied across the three
groups (young, aged, AD), followed by elimination of
genes that did not show a consistent directional change
across aging and AD, based on a 90% confidence interval
threshold. Genes meeting these criteria were designated
‘continuum’ genes. This analysis revealed that only a sub￾set of immune/inflammation genes met the criteria for
progressive change, with the greatest number in the SFG
and HC, and relatively few genes showing this pattern of
expression change in the EC or PCG (Figure 1C). The
majority of significant ‘continuum’ genes in the SFG and
HC showed progressive upregulation (79% and 66%
respectively), with relatively fewer progressively downre￾gulated over aging and AD (21% and 34% respectively).
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 5 of 18

Overall, these analyses reveal that immune/inflammation
genes undergo more extensive responses in the course of
normal aging than in AD. Some immune/inflammation￾related genes undergo progressive change across aging
and AD, especially in the HC and SFG (AD-vulnerable
regions), suggesting that a subset of the genes that
change in AD have already been initiated to some degree
in normal aging. Overall, the EC showed very limited
expression change of immune/inflammation genes in
either aging or AD.
Region-specific patterns of change in males and females
While the importance of gender in modulating gene
responses has become increasingly recognized in the last
few years, gender-specific patterns of gene change that
may occur in the brain in aging and AD have only scarcely
been addressed. Our previous analysis suggested that
gender affected the extent of immune/inflammation gene
change that occurred in the brain over the course of aging.
Building on this initial observation, here we analyze in
detail gender-specific patterns of immune/inflammation
gene response in various brain regions in aging and AD.
In both males and females, in all four brain regions,
the extent of immune/inflammation gene change was
greater in aging than in AD. However, the brain regions
showed gender-specific patterns of change, particularly
in aging. In females, the most extensive age-related gene
change was apparent in the HC, while in males the most
responsive region was the SFG (Figure 2A). In both
males and females, the EC showed the least numbers of
responding genes over the course of aging while the
PCG underwent an intermediate extent of gene change,
and the direction of gene change was predominantly
upregulated in aging.
In AD, while males and females both showed a limited
number of significant gene responses, several gender￾specific differences in gene expression patterns were
apparent. Notably, a greater number of significant gene
changes were observed in females relative to males in
AD, especially in the EC and HC. In addition, the direc￾tion of gene change in all brain regions was virtually
exclusively upregulated in males, while in females a ma￾jority of genes were downregulated, notably in the limbic
regions (Figure 2B).
Finally, gender-specific patterns in immune/inflamma￾tion gene responses also emerged when analyzing genes
undergoing progressive change across aging and AD in
males and females. Notably, while few genes showed
this pattern of response in any brain region in females,
a relatively large number of ‘continuum’ genes were
detected in the SFG in males, with the majority of these
genes undergoing progressively increased expression
across age and AD (Figure 2C).
Overall, these data reveal that the class of genes
related to immune/inflammation function show gender￾specific patterns of change in aging and AD, with the
most pronounced differences emerging in aging. Ana￾lysis of the region-specific patterns of response in aging
and AD indicate that the HC is relatively more prone to
immune/inflammation gene responses in females than
in males, while the SFG is more susceptible to immune/
inflammation gene responses in males.
Figure 1 Immune-related genes undergo more extensive response in the course of cognitively normal aging (age 20 to 99) than in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). (A) In aging, comparing gene expression levels in young (20 to 59 yrs) versus aged (60 to 99 yrs) individuals revealed
that numerous immune-related gene changes occur in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), post-central gyrus (PCG) and hippocampus (HC), with
fewer genes showing significant change in the entorhinal cortex (EC) with age. The majority of gene responses were increased expression with
age, in all brain regions assessed. (B) Relative to aging, fewer immune genes showed significant change in AD versus age-matched controls,
with gene responses primarily restricted to the HC and SFG. Negligible immune gene expression change was observed in the EC and PCG in AD.
(C) A subset of immune-related genes underwent progressive change across aging and AD, particularly in the HC and SFG, predominantly undergoing
increased expression across aging and AD. Few immune genes underwent progressive change across aging and AD in the EC and PCG.

Analysis of aging- and AD-related changes in specific
gene classes associated with inflammation and
innate immunity
Functional analysis of the immune genes responding in age
and AD revealed that many of the immune/inflammation￾related genes were associated with the innate immune
response. The innate immune response represents a
first line of defense to pathogens and other stimuli. The
main effector classes of the innate immune response are
the complement pathway, TLR signaling, inflammasome
activation, and scavenger and immunoglobulin receptors.
These different families act both redundantly and in con￾cert to organize a generic response to non-self patho￾gens, and to stimulate adaptive immune responses
involving MHC I and MHC II molecules [35,36]. Micro￾glial and perivascular macrophages are the principal ef￾fector cells driving the innate immune response in the
brain. There is increasing evidence that many aspects of
the innate immune response can be activated not only
by pathogens but also by endogenous factors that accu￾mulate with age and AD. For example, amyloid-beta
(Aβ) has been shown to activate the complement cascade
via both the classical and alternate pathways [37,38], to
activate toll-like signaling (via activation of TLR2 and
TLR4), and to activate the inflammasome, all of which
lead to release of proinflammatory factors [37,39-49].
Innate immune activation can be neuroprotective when
it is activated appropriately in response to non-self
pathogens and in an acute fashion [4,50-53]. However,
chronic activation of the innate immune response in the
brain is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration in
AD [30,54]. Little is known about the changes in the
innate immune response in humans in the course of cog￾nitively normal aging.
To investigate if the innate immune system is engaged
in the brain in normal aging, and to compare the extent
of engagement in aging and AD, we analyzed in greater
detail expression patterns of genes related to the com￾plement pathway, TLR signaling, inflammasome activa￾tion, scavenger and immunoglobulin receptors, and
MHC I and II.
Aging- and AD-associated increased gene expression of
complement pathway proteins
The complement system is a critical component of the
innate immune response. The involvement of comple￾ment activation in the pathogenesis of AD has been
extensively investigated since the original observations
Figure 2 Immune-related genes undergo gender and region-specific patterns of response in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In
both females and males, the extent of immune-gene response is greater in aging (A, D) than in AD (B, E), with gender-specific patterns of
response across brain regions. In aging, females show the greatest number of genes responding in the hippocampus (HC) (A), while the most
responsive region in males was the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (D). In both genders, the entorhinal cortex (EC) showed the fewest numbers of
responding genes over the course of aging, the post-central gyrus (PCG) underwent an intermediate response, and the direction of gene
change was predominantly upregulated in all brain regions. In AD (B, E), males and females both showed a limited number of significant gene
responses, with a greater number of significant gene changes observed in females (B) relative to males (E), particularly in the EC and HC. For genes
undergoing progressive change across aging and AD (C, F), few such genes were apparent in females (C), with a relatively large number genes
following this pattern in the SFG in males, with the majority of these genes undergoing progressively increased expression across age and AD.

by Eikelenboom and colleagues [55,56]. In particular, ac￾tivation of complement and the associated inflammatory
signaling, opsonization, and cellular damage due to the
membrane attack complex have been proposed to con￾tribute to AD pathogenesis [37,56-58].
Analysis of complement-related genes revealed primar￾ily upregulation of these genes with aging. Among the
genes showing an increase in expression were several
complement receptors and numerous components of
the classical and alternative complement pathways (Add￾itional file 2: Table S2A). Complement-related gene
upregulation was pronounced in the HC, SFG and PCG,
with more modest response in the EC. In particular,
aging was associated with upregulation of C1qA, C1qB,
C1qC, C1s, C3, C3a receptor 1 (C3AR1), C4α, C4β,
C5, C5a receptor 1 (C5AR1), gene expression in the
HC, SFG and PCG. In parallel, genes that curtail com￾plement activation (factor H (CFH), CFH-related 1
(CFHR1), and clusterin) were also upregulated in the
HC, SFG and PCG with aging. In the EC, complement
genes upregulated with age included C1qB, C1qC, C4a
and clusterin.
In AD, only a subset of complement-related genes
showed altered expression relative to age-matched con￾trols (Additional file 2: Table S2B). Specifically, C4A and
C4B were significantly upregulated in AD in the HC and
EC and C3AR1 and C5AR1 in the SFG, while no
complement-related genes were significantly different in
the PCG region. These complement genes also showed a
significant progressive upregulation across aging and AD
(‘continuum’ genes), along with CFHR1 and clusterin in
the HC (Additional file 2: Table S2B). Interestingly, the
continuum analysis revealed significant progressive
upregulation of C5AR1 in the PCG as well. Only one
gene that was significantly changed in AD did not show
a parallel response in aging: in the HC, C1q binding pro￾tein (C1QBP) was significantly downregulated in AD,
but was upregulated in aging.
Overall, these analyses reveal that complement genes
are broadly upregulated in aging, undergo more exten￾sive responses in the course of normal aging than in AD,
and that only a small subset of complement-related
genes show progressive change across aging and AD.
Increased expression of complement genes in aging is
potentially a response to an increase in extracellular deb￾ris, such as Aβ [59]. Importantly, elevated complement
expression may facilitate clearance of such extracellular
debris, the effects of which may be protective. However,
chronic complement activation is likely to be harmful
due to release of potent inflammatory peptides (such as
anaphylatoxins C3a and C5), that bind their activating
receptors C3aR1 and C5aR1 (CD88), and formation of
the membrane attack complex, which can damage cell
membranes [60].
Aging- and AD-associated changes in gene expression
of TLRs and associated proteins
The TLR system is another key effector mechanism of
the innate immune defense system. TLRs initiate sig￾naling cascades that lead to the production of a wide
array of proinflammatory mediators including cytokines,
chemokines, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. This
system of innate immunity is based on a series of pattern
recognition receptors, which recognize pathogen-associated
molecular patterns [61]. In addition to activation by non￾self pathogenic molecules, TLR signaling can be acti￾vated by endogenous ligands including molecules that
accumulate with age and AD, such as Aβ, and other
ligands that are released by injured cells [62-66].
Analysis of TLR-related gene expression revealed a
robust upregulation of this gene class in aging, particu￾larly in the HC, PCG and SFG, with less extensive
response in the EC (Additional file 3: Table S3A). TLR2
was upregulated in all four regions with age, with upre￾gulation of TLR4, TLR5, and MYD88 apparent in the
HC, SFG, and PCG. Additional age-related upregulation
of TLRs was apparent in the HC (TLR1, TLR3, TLR 7,
TLR8). In AD, receptors associated with TLRs were not
as extensively changed as in aging, similar to the pattern
observed for the complement system. Several TLR￾related genes show progressive continuum of change
across aging and AD, including upregulation of TLR4
and TLR5 in the HC and SFG, and TLR2 in the SFG
(Additional file 3: Table S3B). Only one gene that was
significantly changed in AD did not show a parallel
response in aging: TLR 7 is significantly upregulated in
the SFG in AD, but shows little change in aging. Overall,
genes that promote TLR signaling are broadly upregu￾lated in the brain, most prominently in the course of
aging, with a subset of TLR genes showing additional
change in the AD brain.
Recent findings demonstrate that TLR signaling can
be activated by endogenous nonpathogenic ligands, in
particular endogenous molecules released in response to
injury or inflammation [67]. One such ligand is calpro￾tectin, which consist of a heterodimer of two members
of the S100 calcium-binding family of proteins, S100A8
and S100A9, also respectively know as myeloid-related
protein 8 (MRP8) and 14 (MRP14), that can act in syn￾ergy with endogenous and exogenous danger signals to
promote inflammation via TLR interaction [65,68,69].
Analysis of S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression
revealed that aging was associated with marked upregu￾lation (four- to thirteen-fold) of S100A8 in all four brain
regions and upregulation of S100A9 (two- to three-fold)
in the SFG and PCG. Similarly, CD14, a co-activator of
TLR2 and TLR4, was upregulated in all four regions
with aging. While aging was accompanied by widespread
upregulation of calprotectin and CD14, only the S100A8
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 8 of 18
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/9/1/179

component of calprotectin showed further upregulation
in AD (SFG) and CD14 showing no significant change
in any region in AD.
In parallel with increased expression of TLRs, CD14,
and endogenous activators of TLR signaling, expression
of TOLLIP (a toll-interacting protein that attenuates
TLR signaling) was downregulated in multiple brain
regions in both aging and AD. TOLLIP was significantly
downregulated in the SFG and PCG in aging (in Add￾itional file 3: Table S3B) and underwent a significant
progressive downregulation across aging and AD in the
EC, HC and SFG. Such downregulation of TOLLIP sug￾gests that the ‘brakes’ on TLR signaling are less
accessible with age and AD.
Taken together, these analyses reveal that genes that
promote TLR signaling are broadly upregulated in aging,
and undergo more extensive responses in the course of
normal aging than in AD, similar to the response seen
for complement-related genes. A subset of TLR genes
undergoes progressive change across aging and AD, par￾ticularly in the HC and SFG, regions vulnerable to
decline in AD. Similar to the consequences of comple￾ment activation, TLR signaling activates downstream
inflammatory processes, and chronic upregulation of the
TLR system potentially promotes a harmful proinflam￾matory environment in the brain. While there is evi￾dence that TLR signaling can mediate some beneficial
effects in CNS [54,70], it is believed that TLR-induced
activation of microglia and release of proinflammatory
molecules are responsible for neurotoxic processes in
the course of various CNS diseases including AD [71].
Divergent expression of caspase-1 and inflammasome￾related genes in aging and AD
Another component of the innate immune response
involves activation of molecular platforms known as
‘inflammasomes’. Inflammasomes are multi-molecular
complexes that bind to procaspase-1 to activate the
caspase-1 cascade, leading to the maturation of the
proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and
IL-18 [72-74]. IL-1β and IL-18 are elevated in the AD
brain [2,75-77] and have been hypothesized to contrib￾ute to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD
[76,78]. Production of these proinflammatory cytokines
is highly regulated. While availability of the inactive pre￾cursor molecules (pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18) is increased
in response to TLR signaling and cytokines, processing
by caspase-1 is required to form the active cytokines,
thus positioning the inflammasome as a key regulatory
step controlling release of these potent proinflammatory
agents. To investigate if inflammasome-related genes
show altered expression in aging or AD, we investigated
expression patterns for caspase-1 and its downstream
targets IL-1β and IL-18, expression of key components of
the inflammasome complex (NLRP3, ASC), and expres￾sion of several genes involved in inflammasome activa￾tion, including thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP),
P2X7, and pannexins.
Assessment of inflammasome-related genes revealed
prominent upregulation of several inflammasome-related
genes, particularly in aging (Additional file 4: Table S4A,
B). Caspase-1 upregulation was apparent in the HC,
PCG and SFG in aging, with gene expression in the SFG
undergoing progressive upregulation across aging and
AD. In addition, IL-18 was upregulated in aging in the
HC and PCG. While IL-1β expression was below detec￾tion by the microarray, qPCR analysis of HC tissue
revealed upregulation of IL-1β with aging in the HC,
with no further upregulation in AD (Figure 3A). Interest￾ingly, while caspase-1 (the effector of inflammasome
action) was prominently upregulated with aging, other
components of the inflammasome complex did not
show parallel changes with aging or AD. qPCR analysis
of NRLP3 and ASC in SFG tissue revealed that gene
expression was not significantly changed for these
inflammasome components, either in aging or AD,
although there appeared to be a decline in aging
(Figure 3C). Finally, recent literature has revealed that
inflammasomes can be activated via different factors,
with key roles for TXNIP, pannexins, and P2X7. Expres￾sion of TXNIP and pannexins 1 and 2 was prominently
upregulated in multiple brain regions in aging, notably
the EC, PCG, and SFG, with pannexins 1 and 2 showing
progressive upregulation across aging and AD in the HC.
Taken together, aging was characterized by widespread
increased expression of caspase-1, upregulation of tar￾gets of caspase-1 action (Il-1β, IL-18), and increased
expression of agents that can activate the inflamma￾some, suggesting that the inflammasome is poised for
increased activity with age. Like the TLR system, inflam￾masomes can be activated by endogenous factors such
as Aβ, as well as by oxidative stress [49,72,79], brain
levels of which increase with advanced age. Thus,
inflammasome activation can trigger a cascade of events
that have the potential to activate multiple arms of the
innate immune system and drive a chronic proinflamma￾tory state in the elderly brain.
Modulators of microglial and perivascular macrophage
activation in aging and AD
Microglial and perivascular macrophages are the princi￾pal effector cells driving the innate immune response in
the brain. While microglia and macrophages can serve a
neuroprotective function when they participate in the
elimination of cellular debris, chronic activation is
thought to be a major contributor to cognitive decline
and neuropathogenesis in various neurodegenerative dis￾orders including AD [80,81]. Microglia express receptors
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 9 of 18
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/9/1/179

for immunoglobulins (FcRs), which trigger effector func￾tions such as production of cytokines and chemokines,
phagocytosis and degranulation. FcRs are upregulated in
response to innate immune activation, and are increas￾ingly recognized for their contributions to the pathogen￾esis of neurological disorders [82-84].
To investigate how these aspects of microglial and
macrophage activation are affected in aging and AD, we
analyzed the gene expression profiles of FcRs and the
CXC and CCL classes of chemokine ligands and recep￾tors. Analysis of FcR gene expression revealed wide￾spread upregulation of both low and high affinity FcRs,
particularly in aging. Notably, aging was characterized
by upregulation of CD64, CD32, CD16b, and FCER1a in
the HC, PCG and SFG, with a subset of these immuno￾globulin receptors also increased in the EC with aging
(Additional file 5: Table S5A). In addition, CD64 and
CD16b showed progressively increased expression in the
SFG across aging and AD (Additional file 5: Table S5B).
In contrast to the robust response profiles of the FcRs,
little change was detected in the CXC and CCL classes
of chemokine ligands and receptors, in either aging or
AD, with only a few scattered exceptions (Additional file
6). Specifically, significantly increased gene expression
was detected in aging for CCR1 (HC, PCG), CXCL5
(HC), and CXCL16 (HC, PCG, SFG), while CXCL12
gene expression was decreased with aging in the HC
(Table in Additional file 6: S6A). Only two chemokines
showed a significant progressive pattern of change
across aging and AD: CXCL16, which was upregulated
in the EC and SFG, and CXCL14, which was progres￾sively downregulated in the HC across aging and AD
(Additional file 6: Table S6B). These data suggest that as
a whole, chemokine genes are not extensively altered in
aging or AD, even though microglia and macrophages
appear to be activated, as reflected by upregulation of
FcRs. This may be to the increased expression of
S100A8 because it has been shown to cause a shift to￾ward expression of activatory Fcgamma receptors on
macrophages via toll-like receptor 4 [85].
Several mechanisms exist that function to curtail
microglial activation. One important signaling system
that appears to attenuate microglial proinflammatory
responses is the fractalkine ligand and receptor pair
(CX3CL1, CX3CR1 respectively). While in the periphery
fractalkine signaling is associated with proinflammatory
events, in the CNS, fractalkine is neuroprotective. In the
CNS, fractalkine signaling mediates the communication
between microglia and neurons, with the fractalkine re￾ceptor (CX3CR1) highly expressed on microglia and
macrophages [86], and fractalkine constitutively expressed
on neurons throughout the CNS [86]. While CX3CR1
expression was not altered in aging or AD, fractalkine
gene expression was widely downregulated in aging in the
EC, HC, PCG, and SFG (Additional file 6: Table S6A),
with further downregulation in AD in the HC (Add￾itional file 6: Table S6B). The decrease in fractalkine
expression in the absence of parallel changes in the
receptor likely represents a loss of communication
between neurons and microglia/macrophages, and may
promote an activated microglial/macrophage phenotype
in the aging and AD brain.
Another system proposed to play a role in dampening
the inflammatory response is CD163, a scavenger recep￾tor expressed on microglia, monocytes and macrophages
[87,88] with particularly high expression seen in macro￾phages of the ‘alternative activation’ phenotype [87]. In
aging, CD163 was robustly elevated in the HC, PCG and
SFG, with a trend toward continued upregulation in the
SFG in AD (Additional file 5: Tables S5A, B). CD163
can induce release of the anti-inflammatory interleukin
IL-10 [89], which we found to be significantly elevated
Figure 3 qPCR was used to assess expression profiles of several genes for which gene expression was below microarray detection
sensitivity. qPCR analysis of hippocampal gene expression for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, NF-alpha, and the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 revealed significant upregulation of IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-10 with age, and further upregulation of IL-10 in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) (A). Similarly, modulators of cytokine signaling were upregulated in the hippocampus (HC) with age including a six-fold increase in the
suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-3) and a two-fold increase in IRAK3, a serine/threonine kinase that mediates signaling from toll-like
receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptor family members (B). In contrast, no significant change in components of the inflammasome (NRLP3 and ASC)
was detected in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) with aging or AD (C). **** P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.005, *P < 0.05.
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 10 of 18

in the HC with aging and AD, as measured by qPCR
(Figure 3A). Although the presence of ‘alternative activa￾tion’ phenotypes for macrophage and microglia in the
AD brain has previously been observed [90], increased
expression of CD163 in the AD brain is novel.
These data indicate that microglia and macrophages
appear to have an activated phenotype in the aged brain
with some additional activation progressing in AD, as
reflected by upregulation of FcRs due to the activation of
TLR4 by S100A8 [85]. Interestingly, chemokine genes as
a whole did not show altered expression, likely reflecting
that the state of inflammation present in the aged brain
is of a low-grade nature, rather than a robust inflam￾matory state (such as would be present in cerebral infec￾tion). The decrease in fractalkine expression in the
absence of parallel changes in the receptor likely repre￾sents a loss of communication between neurons and
microglia/macrophages, and may promote an activated
microglial/macrophage phenotype in the aging and
AD brain. Finally, upregulation of CD163 and IL-10,
which were particularly prominent in aging, likely pro￾vides some counterbalance to other gene changes that
are proinflammatory.
Aging- and AD-associated changes in expression for MHC
class I and II genes
Another measure reflecting an activated innate immune
response is the induction of MHC class I and II mole￾cules. Although MHC I and II proteins are typically
involved in presentation of foreign antigens processed
from invading organisms, an increase in gene expression
is also an early indication of activation of the innate im￾mune response in the absence of foreign antigens, be￾cause MHC II genes are upregulated in sterile injuries or
trauma. Further, MHC molecules are upregulated on
microglia and macrophages in response to elevated
levels of cytokines associated with inflammation, and in
response to chronic pathology and neurodegeneration
such as occurs in AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) [91-94]. Indeed, increased gene expression of
MHC II has been extensively documented in both AD
and transgenic mouse models of AD [95].
Analysis of the classical MHC II and I genes revealed
pronounced upregulation in aging and AD. Notably,
aging was characterized by widespread upregulation of
all MHC II subtypes (DP alpha, DP beta, DQ alpha, DQ
beta, DR alpha, DR beta, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB) across
the four brain regions (Additional file 7: Table S7A),
with continued upregulation of many of these genes in
AD, particularly in the EC, PCG and SFG (Additional
file 7: Table S7B). Of particular interest was the upregu￾lation of HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB, two MHC class II
genes that are critical for intracellular peptide loading of
other MHC class II proteins on antigen-presenting cells.
While in the HC, classical MHC class II genes showed
an overall trend toward progressively increased upregu￾lation in aging and AD, only one probe set met the statis￾tical criteria of a ‘continuum’ gene. Finally, classical MHC
class I genes (HLA-B, HLA-C) were upregulated with
aging in the HC, PCG and SFG with progressively
increased expression in the HC in AD, with no probe sets
reaching significance in the EC in either aging or AD.
Interestingly, there was also a robust age-dependent
increase in the nonclassical MHC I genes. HLA-E, HLA￾F and HLA-G genes underwent pronounced upregulation
in the aged brain, particularly in the HC, with HLA-E
additionally upregulated in the PCG and SFG (Additional
file 8: Table S8A). Gene expression for HLA-E and HLA￾G showed progressive upregulation across aging and AD
in limbic regions (both HC and EC), but not in the cor￾tical regions (Additional file 8: Table S8B). Upregulation
of HLA-E and HLA-G expression is emerging as a
mechanism to protect target tissues from auto-aggressive
inflammation, such as in conditions of chronic inflam￾mation [96], and may function to provide inhibitory
feedback to downregulate microglial activation.
Using the upregulation of MHC class genes as another
readout of microglial activation, these data support the
concept emerging from our data that microglia gain an
activated phenotype that is initiated in the course of
aging, and continues to progress in AD. It is likely that
the chronic presence of low levels of proinflammatory
cytokines accompanying innate immune activation is
driving upregulation of MHC genes. Because the non￾classical MHCs are considered mediators of immune tol￾erance, the widespread upregulation of these genes in
aging may be due to a chronic activation of the innate
immune response.
qPCR validation of immune gene expression changes
in aging and AD
qPCR was undertaken in the HC from a subset of cases
to validate the microarray data for several genes related
to TLR signaling and regulation (specifically CD14,
TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, MYD88, TOLLIP). In addition,
qPCR was used to assess expression profiles of several
genes for which gene expression was below the micro￾array sensitivity including the proinflammatory cytokines
TNF-alpha, IL-Iβ, IL-6, the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10, and modulators of cytokine signaling including sup￾pressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and interleukin-1
receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3/IRAKM), a serine/
threonine kinase that helps mediate signaling from TLRs
and IL-1 receptor family members. Finally, for assess￾ment of inflammasome-related gene expression, qPCR
was undertaken in the SFG for NRLP3 and ASC. A sub￾set of cases used in the microarray was used for qPCR
analysis based on tissue availability.
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 11 of 18
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/9/1/179

The expression profiles across aging and AD obtained
by qPCR for CD14, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, MYD88, and
TOLLIP were in good agreement with the expression
profiles determined using microarrays (Figure 4). For
comparison purposes, microarray data is shown for
the same set of cases as were used for qPCR. Analysis
of cytokine expression profiles using qPCR revealed
increased expression with aging for IL-Iβ, IL-6, TNF￾alpha, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Intri￾guingly, IL-10 showed a modest increase with aging and
a more pronounced increase following the transition to
AD (Figure 3A). In addition, analysis of gene expression
profiles for modulators of cytokine signaling revealed
robust gene upregulation of IRAK3 and SOCS3 with
age, but no further increase with AD (Figure 3). Finally,
no significant gene expression changes were detected for
the inflammasome-related genes NRLP3 and ASC, either
in aging or AD (Figure 3B). Overall, the patterns of gene
expression change detected using qPCR paralleled the
general pattern that emerged from the microarray ana￾lysis of immune/inflammation genes as a whole, with the
greatest gene expression changes generally occurring
with aging rather than in the transition to AD.
Discussion
While there is extensive data on immune gene responses
in the AD brain [2], less is known about the brain
responses of these genes across the lifespan in normal
aging, particularly for the innate immune system. There is
an increasing appreciation that innate immunity can be
activated in the CNS in response to cellular stress
or injury without activation of the adaptive arm of the im￾mune system [54,97-102], and importantly, that the innate
immune response can be activated by a number of
endogenous factors that may accumulate in the brain with
aging and AD. Using a microarray approach, we have
comprehensively investigated immune gene expression in
four brain regions in cognitively normal aging across the
adult lifespan (20 to 99) and in AD, with a particular
focus on subclasses of the innate immune response.
Several novel concepts emerge from this analysis. First,
our data reveal that immune/inflammation-related genes
show major changes in gene expression over the course
of cognitively normal aging, and that the extent of
gene response is far greater in aging than in AD. Of
the 759 immune-related probesets interrogated on the
microarray, approximately 40% are significantly altered
(P < 0.01) in the SFG, PCG and HC with increasing age,
with the majority upregulated (64 to 86%). In contrast to
the extensive gene response in aging, far fewer immune/
inflammation genes were significantly changed in the
transition to AD (approximately 6% of immune-related
probe sets), with gene responses primarily restricted to
the SFG and HC. Second, relatively few significant
changes in immune/inflammation genes were detected
in the EC either in aging or AD, although many genes
Figure 4 Gene expression profiles in young, aged, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) samples using hippocampal tissue show similar
patterns of change with qPCR and microarray analysis. qPCR (A,B) demonstrated significant gene upregulation of CD14, TLR2, TL4, TLR7,
MYD88 and downregulation of TOLLIP in aging, confirming microarray results (C,D). **** P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.005, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 12 of 18

in the EC showed similar trends in responses as in
the other brain regions. Third, a subset of immune/
inflammation genes undergo a progressive pattern of
change across aging and AD, with these genes predom￾inantly showing progressive upregulation. Interestingly,
very few genes in the PCG underwent a progressive pat￾tern of change across aging and AD (some exceptions
included complement C5AR1 and several MHC class II
genes), even though extensive change occurred in this
brain region during aging. The PCG thus appears to be
refractory to change during the transition to AD, which
may be related to the relative sparing in this brain region
from AD-related neuropathology. Finally, our data
reveal that immune/inflammation genes undergo gender￾specific patterns of response in aging and AD, with the
most pronounced differences emerging in aging. In par￾ticular, the HC shows major changes in normal aging
that are most prominent in females, while the SFG shows
greater age-related changes in males. These results sup￾port accumulating evidence of a gender effect on brain
aging, which have recently been documented at the gene
expression level [28], morphometric level [103,104] and
level of cortical connectivity networks [105].
Strikingly, functional analysis of the immune genes sig￾nificantly changed with aging or AD revealed that many
of these genes were associated with the innate immune
response. Key components of the innate immune system
are complement, TLRs, inflammasomes, and scavenger
and immunoglobulin receptors [61]. Our data demon￾strate that in aging, there are major changes across
nearly all these gene classes in the HC, PCG, and SFG,
with gene responses overwhelmingly favoring increased
activation. A subset of these genes showed progressively
more change with the transition to AD, particularly
in the HC and SFG. Because activation of the innate
immune response induces release of proinflammatory
cytokines and key co-stimulatory molecules, these gene
changes indicate a broad-based increase in a proinflam￾matory environment that is initiated with normal aging
and that continues to increase to a lesser degree follow￾ing the transition to AD.
A concept that has gained traction in recent years is
that changes that occur during normal aging may prime
the CNS for subsequent development of neurodegenera￾tive disorders [29-31]. Conditions in the aged brain bear
similarity to a chronic injury environment, including
accumulation of a variety of endogenous factors (fibrillar
Aβ, calprotecin, and proinflammatory cytokines) that
can activate various arms of the innate immune system
and trigger a feed-forward mechanism driving chronic
innate immune activation. Inefficient clearance of aber￾rant proteins, a process that becomes increasingly
defective with age [106] may represent an initiating fac￾tor upregulating innate immune activity in the brain. In
addition, accumulation of Aβ acts as a low-grade irritant
that can trigger the innate immune system via several
mechanisms, including complement activation [37], acti￾vation of TLR signaling [39-48], and activation of the
inflammasome [49]. Moreover, impaired clearance of Aβ
may be related to deficits in beclin 1, an autophagy￾related protein that has been shown to decrease Aβ
accumulation in mice [107-109]. In our dataset, beclin 1
gene expression was decreased in aging in the HC, PCG,
and SFG with continued decline in the SFG in AD, con￾sistent with recent findings that beclin-1 protein in the
mid-frontal cortex is reduced in early AD [107-109]. We
speculate that the beclin 1 deficit that develops during
normal aging may contribute to Aβ accumulation,
which can in turn activate complement, TLRs, and the
inflammasome (when in a fibrillar form), with conse￾quent release of potent inflammatory peptides and
proinflammatory cytokines [48,49,110]. Aβ is likely to be
both an initiating trigger and chronic driver of innate
immune activation [111], consistent with growing data
suggesting that MCI cases with high Aβ are at increased
probability for converting to AD [112].
Our data showing widespread caspase-1 upregulation
with aging suggest that the inflammasome may be active
in the aged brain. The increased expression of calprotec￾tin, which along with Aβ can trigger TLR activation,
may establish a feed-forward mechanism for continued
activation of the innate immune system and perpetu￾ation of a chronic proinflammatory environment in the
aged brain. Further, inflammasome activation of caspase￾1 has been reported to initiate unconventional protein
secretion (for example, independent of the endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway) to export cytokines
from the cell, including IL-1β and IL-18, allowing these
proinflammatory molecules to engage their extracellular
receptors [113,114]. Caspase-1-induced unconventional
protein secretion may facilitate the cellular efflux of
other cytoplasmic proteins, including misfolded tau and
alpha-synuclein, thereby participating in the propagation
of these proteinopathies [115,116], which in turn further
contribute to innate immune activation.
At the same time, a number of counteractive measures
to attenuate a proinflammatory environment exist. Our
microarray data reveal that several of these protective
mechanisms appear to be engaged in the brain in aging
and AD, including upregulation of CFH, CFHR1 and
clusterin to curtail complement activation, upregulation
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, upregulation of
CD163, and upregulation of nonclassical MHCI genes
(HLA-E and HLA-G). However, our microarray data also
revealed that some of the measures to attenuate a proin￾flammatory environment are downregulated with aging
and AD, for example TOLLIP, which attenuates TLR￾signaling, and fractalkine in neurons, which curtails
Cribbs et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9:179 Page 13 of 18

microglial activation. TOLLIP underwent progressively
pronounced downregulation in aging and AD, notably in
brain regions that are vulnerable to decline in aging and
AD. In parallel, fractalkine gene expression was widely
downregulated in all brain regions examined, with add￾itional downregulation in AD in the HC. Several lines
of evidence support an important neuroprotective role
for fractalkine signaling, including the demonstration
in three different in vivo models that deficiency of the
fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) alters microglial responses
and results in significant neurotoxicity [117], and impairs
hippocampal cognitive function and synaptic plasticity
[118]. The decline in fractalkine gene expression poten￾tially contributes to decreased neuronal control of micro￾glial activation, and in parallel, downregulation of
TOLLIP suggests that the brakes on TLR signaling are
less accessible with age and AD, both of which would
contribute to driving a chronic proinflammatory state.
These data suggest that one therapeutic approach to
interrupt or attenuate the cycle of chronic innate immune
activation may be to develop interventions that counter￾act downregulation of these protective mechanisms.
Finally, our data reveal an aspect of microglia activa￾tion present in aging that may have relevance to the
adverse cerebrovascular events reported with the anti￾Aβ immunotherapy clinical trials [119]. Namely, the
aging brain shows widespread increased expression of
activating FcRs (FcRI, IIa, IIIb). Because regulation of
antibody-mediated immune responses is crucial to pre￾vent uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage, both
activating and inhibitory FcRs are generally expressed by
cells. However, our data revealed that in the aged and
AD brain, gene expression for activating FcRs was upre￾gulated in the absence of a parallel response of inhibi￾tory FcRs. One factor that may contribute to the specific
upregulation of activating FcRs may be related to the
age-related increased gene expression of calprotectin,
which can shift FcR expression toward activating
Fcgamma receptors on macrophages via toll-like recep￾tor 4 [85]. The upregulation of activating FcRs may be
detrimental when antibodies or immune complexes are
present in the brain, especially when these responses are
not appropriately regulated by inhibitory FcRs. This may
be particularly relevant when active or passive anti-Aβ
immunotherapy is administered to elderly individuals
who have substantial amyloid burden in the brain. Aβ￾antibody immune complexes can initiate microglia and
perivascular macrophage activation via FcRs, as well as
trigger complement activation and release of inflamma￾tory mediators, thereby potentially contributing to the
adverse cerebral vascular events that have plagued the
immunotherapy clinical trials [119,120].
Our data are consistent with previous immunohisto￾chemical studies of AD brain tissue, which have shown
many of the classic features of immune/injury-mediated
cellular damage including increases in proinflammatory
cytokines, expression of MHC class I and class II antigens
on microglia, and evidence of complement activation
within thioflavin-positive neuritic plaques [2,55,56,121,122].
Importantly however, our data emphasize the fact that
the majority of these changes in immune/inflammation￾related genes in the brain occur long before the earliest
clinical signs of cognitive decline, with only modest add￾itional change occurring in AD. These findings help clar￾ify recent epidemiologic evidence that midlife long-term
use of NSAIDs delays onset of AD, and findings from a
randomized clinical trial (Alzheimer's Disease Anti￾inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT)) that NSAID
treatment of asymptomatic individuals reduces AD inci￾dence with long-term use (two to three plus years) while
NSAIDs provide no benefit in patients with symptomatic
AD and have an adverse effect in later stages of AD
[123]. These results are consistent with our data demon￾strating that much of the immune activation has been
chronically present long before clinical symptoms of AD
become apparent. Overall, these findings provide import￾ant basic knowledge on the state of immune activation in
the brain with aging and AD, data that will be particularly
useful for tailoring therapeutic approaches that target
inflammation to slow cognitive decline in aging and AD.
Conclusions
Our data reveal that the aging brain is characterized by
widespread upregulation of genes reflecting activation
of microglia and perivascular macrophages, with the
upregulation of essentially all pathways of the innate
immune system coupled with a downregulation of select
factors (TOLLIP, fractalkine) that when present curtail
microglial/macrophage activation. Activation of the
innate immune response is initially likely to be beneficial.
However, long-term innate immune activation causes
chronic proinflammatory conditions and release of en￾dogenous factors (Aβ, calprotectin, proinflammatory
cytokines) that can drive destructive cascades. Unexpect￾edly, the extent of innate immune gene upregulation in
AD was modest relative to the robust response apparent
in the aged brain, consistent with the emerging idea of
a critical involvement of inflammation in the earliest
stages, perhaps even in the preclinical stage, of AD.
We hypothesize that with aging, the brain accumulates
levels of multiple endogenous and exogenous factors
that act as low-grade irritants continuously reinforcing
microglia activation and priming microglia responses.
AD ensues when the net effect of these factors surpasses
a certain threshold, partnered with reduced capacity to
temper microglial reactivity. Aβ, in conjunction with
increased levels of harmful endogenous factors, impaired
growth factor signaling by proinflammatory cytokines

[124], metabolic deficits [125], and other factors, ultim￾ately converge to exceed the threshold for the onset of
AD. Ultimately, our data suggest that an important strat￾egy to maintain cognitive health and resilience involves
reducing chronic innate immune activation, but that this
intervention should be initiated relatively early in aging
(by approximately 50 years of age), and prior to clinical
signs of cognitive difficulty.
