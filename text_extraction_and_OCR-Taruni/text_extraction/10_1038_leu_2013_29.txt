This phase 2 study assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of carfilzomib, a selective proteasome
inhibitor, in patients with multiple myeloma and varying degrees of renal impairment, including patients on chronic hemodialysis.
Patients were grouped by creatinine clearance: 480 ml/min, 50–80 ml/min, 30–49 ml/min, o30 ml/min and chronic hemodialysis.
Carfilzomib was administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 in 28-day cycles: 15 mg/m2 (Cycle 1), 20 mg/m2 (Cycle 2) and 27 mg/m2
(Cycles 3 þ ). There were no differences in carfilzomib clearance or exposure among patients with normal renal function and any
group with renal impairment. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) included anemia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (20.0%), lymphopenia
(18.0%) and fatigue (14.0%). AEs were similar among groups. At 15 mg/m2
, proteasome inhibition up to 85% was observed and did
not differ among groups. Although nearly 50% of patients were refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide, end of study
partial response or better (overall response rate) was 25.5% with 7.9 months median duration of response. In conclusion,
the pharmacokinetics and safety of carfilzomib were not influenced by the degree of baseline renal impairment, including in
patients on dialysis, and carfilzomib was well tolerated and demonstrated promising efficacy.

INTRODUCTION
Renal impairment is a frequent and severe complication in
patients with multiple myeloma (MM).1,2 The pathology is hetero￾geneous and includes a variety of factors such as hypercalcemia,
cast nephropathy and immunoglobulin light chain damage
(usually irreversible) to tubular cells.3 The incidence of renal
insufficiency in patients with newly diagnosed MM varies by the
definition; while 50% of 2380 newly diagnosed patients with MM
had impaired renal function as determined by elevated creatinine
clearance (CrCl) at diagnosis,4,5 only 15–20% had serum creatinine
42.3 mg/dl. Renal impairment has been associated with poor
prognosis and shorter survival in patients with MM, not only
because of the advanced state of disease that caused the renal
impairment but also because of limited treatment options and
dose reductions commonly implemented in these patients
that lead to diminished efficacy.1,5 While it is true that renal
insufficiency may increase the toxicity of various therapies in MM,
recent data suggest that novel agents such as thalidomide and
bortezomib are safe and effective in patients with MM and
renal failure.6
Carfilzomib is a selective proteasome inhibitor that, like
bortezomib, primarily inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity
of the proteasome.7,8 In preclinical studies, carfilzomib showed
greater selectivity than bortezomib for the proteasome without
inhibiting off-target proteases, and had antiproliferative activity
in cells resistant to bortezomib.7 In previous phase 2 studies,
carfilzomib demonstrated durable responses in heavily pretreated
patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM including patients
with mild to moderate renal impairment.9,10 Unlike results shown
with intravenous (IV) bortezomib,11 peripheral neuropathy events
during treatment with carfilzomib are mild and occur at a low
rate.12
The current phase 2, open-label, multicenter study was
designed to assess the influence of renal impairment on the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed,
refractory and/or progressive MM after at least two prior regimens.
Secondary outcomes included safety, tolerability, pharmacody￾namic (PDn) measures and efficacy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient population
Patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM whose disease was
progressing after two or more prior lines of therapy were eligible to
participate. On the basis of CrCl, roughly estimated using the Cockcroft￾Gault equation,13 patients were assigned to 1 of 4 groups according to
renal function or to a fifth group consisting of patients on dialysis (Table 1).
Additional inclusion criteria included, age X18 years, current measur￾able disease, life expectancy of 43 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group Performance Status 0–2, adequate hepatic function, total white
blood cell count X2000/mm3
, absolute neutrophil count X1000/mm3
,
hemoglobin X7 g/dl and platelet count X30 000/mm3
. Patients were
required to protect against pregnancy during and for 3 months following
the study. Patients were excluded if they had previously received
carfilzomib therapy; transfusions or growth factor support within 7 days
of the first dose; or radiation therapy or immunotherapy, major surgery or
chemotherapy with approved or investigative anticancer therapeutics
within 3 weeks of the first dose. The following medical conditions were
also exclusion criteria: plasma cell leukemia or other malignancy within the
past 3 years, significant neuropathy (Grade 2 with pain, or Grade 3/4),

POEMS syndrome, severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart
Association Class III–IV), symptomatic ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled
hypertension, known or suspected HIV infection, active hepatitis infection,
known or suspected cardiac amyloidosis and concomitant myelodysplastic
syndrome. Patients for whom oral and/or IV fluid hydration, dexametha￾sone, or allopurinol was contraindicated were also excluded.
This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00721734). All patients
provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved
by the institutional review boards of participating centers.
Study design and drug dosing
Carfilzomib was administered by IV infusion over 2–10 min on days 1, 2, 8,
9, 15 and 16 of a 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. The dose of carfilzomib in
Cycle 1 was 15 mg/m2
. If this dose was tolerated, it was increased to
20 mg/m2 at Cycle 2, and to 27 mg/m2 at Cycle 3 and for all subsequent
cycles as tolerated. Patients who experienced an adverse event (AE) were
permitted a one-level dose reduction of carfilzomib (for example, from
27 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2
); after 1 cycle at the lower dose and resolution of
the AE, the previous dose could be resumed. If toxicity continued or
recurred, the patient was either permitted a second dose reduction or was
discontinued from the study at the discretion of the treating physician and
the study medical monitor. Patients who discontinued treatment were
followed for 2 years for survival and disease status unless they withdrew
consent. Patients in whom there was continuing clinical benefit after
12 cycles could receive additional treatment with carfilzomib in a separate
extension study (PX-171-010, NCT00884312).
On the basis of findings from earlier phase 1 and phase 2 studies,9,14
dexamethasone 4 mg was administered before carfilzomib dosing during
Cycle 1 and could be continued in subsequent cycles if treatment-related
fever, chills, and/or dyspnea were observed. In addition, patients with less
than partial response (PR) after Cycle 2 or less than complete response
after Cycle 4 were eligible to receive dexamethasone 20 mg before each
dose of carfilzomib to improve response; prophylactic antiviral therapy was
also added in these patients. In addition, all patients were required to
be well hydrated before dosing with carfilzomib. They were encouraged
to consume at least 30 ml/kg/day orally for 48 h before carfilzomib dosing
in all cycles; in addition, 250–500 ml of IV fluid were administered before
and after each carfilzomib dose during Cycle 1. Hydration could be
adjusted in patients on dialysis according to their hydration status.
Optional allopurinol was provided to patients considered at risk for tumor
lysis syndrome. Patients could receive red blood cell transfusions or
supportive care with erythropoietin or darbepoetin in accordance with
institutional guidelines.
PK analyses
Blood for plasma PK analysis was collected on days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1,
and on day 15 of Cycle 2, before dosing (t ¼ 0), at the end of dosing, and at
5, 15 and 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h after dosing; urine samples
were collected cumulatively over 0–5 h and 5–24 h on days 1 and 15 of
Cycle 1 following administration of carfilzomib to determine carfilzomib
concentrations. Carfilzomib concentrations were determined using vali￾dated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS)
methods with a calibration range of 0.300–300 ng/ml for plasma samples
and 4.0–2000 ng/ml for urine samples. Plasma concentration of carfilzomib
versus time was plotted on days 1 and 15 in Cycle 1, and PK parameters
were calculated using a non-compartmental constant infusion method
using WinNonlin (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). To determine whether
renal impairment affected the PK of carfilzomib, the relationship between
renal function status and relevant PK parameters was evaluated. Statistical
comparison (analysis of variance) of the ln-transformed dose-adjusted PK
parameters was also performed between patients with normal renal
function and each group of patients with renal impairment. For these
parameters, 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the ratios
between least squares of the mean (LSM) for each group versus the normal
renal function group (Group 1). Two criteria were to be met to conclude
that the available data refuted an effect of renal impairment on the
PK of carfilzomib: (1) the 90% CI for the LSM ratio of carfilzomib AUC fell
within the interval of 80–125%, and (2) the 90% CI for the LSM ratio of
Cmax fell within the interval of 70–143%. The primary PK parameters—
apparent plasma clearance, dose-normalized AUCinf (total exposure),
and the dose-normalized Cmax on day 1 and day 15 of Cycle 1—were also
estimated as a function of CrCl by linear regression using a mixed-effects
model (Y ¼ b0 þ b1CrCl þ b2Age þ b3weight, where Y ¼ PK para￾meter, b0 ¼ intercept, and b1, b2 and b3 are slope parameters associated
with CrCl, age and weight, respectively).
PDns
Proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity was measured in whole-blood (red
blood cells, RBC) and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples
using a fluorogenic-based substrate assay as previously described.15 Blood
for PDn analysis was collected before carfilzomib dosing and 1 h after
carfilzomib dosing on days 1, 2 and 8 of Cycle 1 and on day 1 of Cycle 2.
Safety
All patients who received at least one dose of carfilzomib were included in
the safety population. Incidence, severity and duration of AEs, including
all serious AEs and those considered to be treatment related, and shifts to
or from abnormal relative to baseline in key laboratory parameters were
categorized according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0.16 In
addition, all patients had intensive triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG)
readings before carfilzomib dosing, 5 and 20 min post-dose, and 1, 2, 4 and
24 h post-dose on days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on day 15 of Cycle 2 that
were read by a central laboratory. ECGs were performed in most patients
to satisfy regulatory requirements, but were not required by the study
protocol.
Efficacy
Patients who received at least 1 cycle of carfilzomib and had at least one
post-baseline assessment for disease response were included in the
efficacy analysis. Each evaluable patient’s best response to treatment over
the course of the study was evaluated by the investigator and sponsor
using the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response
Criteria, modified to include minimal response defined per the European
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.17,18 Responses assessed by
the investigators at the end of the study are reported here. The overall
response rate was defined as the proportion of PR or better responses, and
the 95% Clopper-Pearson exact binomial CI was calculated. The duration of
response was calculated as the time from the first evidence of a PR
or better until confirmation of disease progression. Median time to

progression and progression-free survival were assessed among all
patients with 4stable disease (s.d.). For progression-free survival, deaths
due to causes other than disease progression were censored.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study at five centers in
the US; the first patient in November 2008 and the last patient in
January 2010. PK, safety, and PDn results are based on the data
collected through March 2010, 2 months after the enrollment
completed. End-of-study response data (overall response rate and
duration of response) are based on assessments through
December 2011. Patient demographics and baseline character￾istics are shown in Table 2. Approximately 26.0% of patients had a
poor prognosis as assessed by cytogenetic analysis and/or
fluorescence in situ hybridization. All but two patients (96.0%)
had previously received bortezomib, and 33 patients (66.0%) were
refractory to prior bortezomib therapy, including 17 patients
(34.0%) who were refractory to bortezomib as the most recent
therapy. Twenty-three patients (46.0%) were refractory to both
bortezomib and lenalidomide.
Patient disposition
Patients received a median of 4 cycles (range, 1–12) of carfilzomib.
All 50 patients were included in the safety analysis, 10 patients
were not evaluable for PK, and three were not evaluable for
efficacy (Table 1). Thirteen patients continued to receive treatment
on study at the time of the data cutoff, and three additional
patients completed 12 cycles of carfilzomib treatment and
continued to receive carfilzomib on extension access protocol
PX-171-010.19 Among the 34 patients who discontinued
treatment, 24 discontinued due to PD, 6 discontinued due to an
AE, and 4 withdrew consent.
The doses of carfilzomib across groups ranged from 14.3 mg/m2
to 25.3 mg/m2 per administration throughout the study and were
generally consistent across the groups. Forty-one patients (82.0%)
escalated to 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 2, and 27 of these (54.0% overall)
escalated to 27 mg/m2 in Cycle 3. Twenty-two patients (44.0%)
missed a carfilzomib dose, and 17 (34.0%) had carfilzomib
administration delayed at least once. Exposure to carfilzomib
was similar between groups with two exceptions—those on
chronic dialysis and those in Group 3 with moderate renal
impairment received fewer cycles primarily due to discontinua￾tions attributed to progressive disease. Per protocol, 28 patients
with oPR after Cycle 2 or ocomplete response after Cycle 4
received dexamethasone 20 mg before each dose of carfilzomib to
improve response.
Pharmacokinetics
Table 3 shows the PK parameters for the five groups after dosing.
Following IV administration of 15 mg/m2 over 2–10 min on day 1
of Cycle 1, carfilzomib plasma concentration decreased rapidly in a
biphasic manner with a median terminal half life (t1/2) of less than
60 min across all groups, and the profile was consistent between
days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 (Figure 1). Mean (±s.d.) carfilzomib
clearance ranged from 113 ±40.7 l/h (Group 2) to 288 ±264 l/h
(Group 3). Across groups, the geometric means of Cmax and
AUCinf ranged from 1231–2077 ng/ml and 145–241 ng  h/ml,
respectively. Analysis of variance of the ln-transformed dose￾adjusted plasma PK parameters indicated that there were no
apparent differences in the Cmax and AUCinf between Group 1
and any of the groups of patients with renal impairment. However,
due to high interpatient variability, none of the 90% CIs for
the ratio of geometric LSM of AUC were entirely contained within
the prespecified interval of 80–125% and none of the 90% CIs for
the ratio of geometric LSM of Cmax were entirely contained within
the prespecified interval of 70–143%.
As a secondary analysis of the impact of renal impairment on
carfilzomib clearance, the carfilzomib PK profile was estimated as
a function of CrCl by linear regression using a mixed effects model.
Carfilzomib clearance, dose-normalized Cmax, and dose-normal￾ized AUCinf on day 1 of Cycle 1 all had a slope of the regression
that did not significantly (P40.05) differ from zero (Table 4). The
same was true when adjusted for age, weight, or age þ weight.
Although the analysis of variance analysis was inconclusive, these
results suggest that renal function did not affect carfilzomib PK.
A robust comparison between dosing cycles could not be
performed due to the limited PK data obtained from patients
who were treated with 15 mg/m2 for Cycle 2. In treatment Cycle 2,
patients were allowed to escalate the dose to 20 mg/m2
.
A summary of PK results for the carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 dose on
day 15 of Cycle 2 is also presented in Table 3. Similar to the 15 mg/m2
dose, the AUC, Cmax, and t1/2 across the groups of patients at
20 mg/m2 suggest no apparent effect of renal impairment on the
PK of carfilzomib in patients with MM.
All but two patients had measurable concentrations of
carfilzomib in urine during the 0- to 5-h post-dose collection
interval on days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1. Carfilzomib concentration
was below the lower limit of quantitation for most patients during
the 5- to 24-h post-dose interval on all days. On day 1 of Cycle 1,
the mean total concentration during this time period ranged from
0.050 mg in the group with moderate renal impairment to
0.157 mg in the group with normal renal function. In all groups,
the total amount of carfilzomib recovered in the urine on Days 1
and 15 of Cycle 1 represented less than 1% of the administered
dose, suggesting renal clearance does not play an important role
in carfilzomib elimination.

Safety
There were no appreciable differences in the safety profiles of
carfilzomib among Groups 1–4 for frequency or National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade
of AEs (Table 5). All but one patient in Group 1 (normal renal
function) and two patients in Group 5 (dialysis) experienced at
least one treatment-emergent AE (94.0% overall). The most
common AEs of any grade were fatigue (56.0%), anemia (50.0%),
nausea and diarrhea (36.0% each) (Table 5). Hematologic
abnormalities were typically transient, as suggested by the
relatively consistent median laboratory values over the course of
treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). Clinical congestive heart
failure was noted in four patients, three of whom continued on
the study after fluid adjustment, and one of whom discontinued.
Serious AEs occurred in 33 patients (66.0%), the most common
being pneumonia (n ¼ 8 patients, 16.0%), acute renal failure,
congestive heart failure, dehydration, and influenza (three patients
each, 6.0%). Most Grade 3/4 AEs were hematologic, including
anemia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (20.0%) and lymphopenia
(18.0%) (Table 5). Grade 3/4 infections included bacterial
pneumonia (n ¼ 6, 12.0%), influenza (n ¼ 3, 6.0%), respiratory tract
infection (n ¼ 2, 4.0%) and sepsis (n ¼ 2, 4.0%).

Adverse Events grading. Five patients (not including those
on dialysis) experienced elevations in serum creatinine from Grade
p2 at baseline to Grade 3 at any point after beginning treatment.
Six patients (12.0%) with pre-existing renal impairment (in Groups 2,
3 and 4) experienced worsening of renal function to Grade 3: one
patient in Group 3 had increased blood creatinine, and five patients
had acute renal failure. The five renal failure events were preceded
by clinical or laboratory evidence of myeloma progression, while the
serious AEs of increased blood creatinine followed an episode
of infection and possible dehydration.
Neuropathy was noted at baseline in 92.0% of patients: Grade 1
in 33 patients (66.0%) and Grade 2 in 7 patients (26.0%). The
incidence of treatment-emergent or worsening neuropathy
(a composite of AE terms ‘peripheral neuropathy,’ ‘neuropathy’,
‘peripheral sensory neuropathy’ and ‘peripheral motor neuropa￾thy’) of any grade was 12.0%. Only one patient (who had Grade 2
neuropathy at baseline) reported Grade 3 neuropathy during the
study (2.0%), which did not resolve before data cutoff; no other
Grade 3 neuropathy was reported.
Forty-nine patients had evaluable ECGs performed in triplicate
while on study. The ECG data showed no clinically relevant effects
on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction, or cardiac depolariza￾tion as measured by the QT, PR, and QRS intervals, and no
correlation with the plasma concentration of carfilzomib. However,
the results could not clearly define the magnitude of effect due to
the small sample size and lack of a control group.
AEs led to dose reduction in nine patients (18.0%) two each in
Groups 1, 3, and 4, and three patients in Group 2. AEs leading to
treatment discontinuation in six patients included (one patient
each) congestive heart failure, fatigue, dyspnea, hypoesthesia,
sepsis and venoocclusive disease of the liver. The latter followed a
severe respiratory infection requiring intubation and intensive
care support. All AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were
attributed to carfilzomib.
There were five deaths on study or within 30 days of
discontinuation of treatment: one patient each in Group 2 and
Group 4, and three patients in Group 5. All deaths were attributed
primarily to disease progression, with one death complicated by a
respiratory tract infection.
PDns
One hour after the first dose of carfilzomib (15 mg/m2
), protea￾some CT-L activity was significantly inhibited (by 73–87%) from
pre-dose levels in RBCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The extent of inhibition did not differ significantly among groups
(Figure 2). Proteasome inhibition was maintained in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells on day 2, but recovery of activity was
complete or near to complete on day 8 (5 days after the most
recent dose) and at the beginning of Cycle 2 (12 days after
dosing). Cumulative inhibition of proteasome CT-L activity was
noted in RBCs during the first treatment cycle with little to no
recovery by the start of Cycle 2.
Efficacy
Twelve of 47 response-evaluable patients achieved PR or better
(overall response rate 25.5%) (Table 6). The median duration of
response was 7.9 months (95% CI 6.5–not reached). Renal
impairment did not appear to diminish antitumor response to
carfilzomib; among the 36 response-evaluable patients with renal
impairment (excluding Group 1, patients with normal renal
function), overall response rate was 27.7%.
Twenty-eight patients received dexamethasone before each
carfilzomib dose after Cycle 2 to improve responses (Table 6);
26 patients received dexamethasone 20 mg, while two patients
received dexamethasone 40 mg. Response improved to PR
after the addition of dexamethasone in nine of these 28 patients
(32.1%).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study that directly assessed carfilzomib PK and PDn
in patients with MM and renal impairment, including patients on
dialysis. Carfilzomib PK did not appear appreciably altered in
patients with renal impairment, including those on dialysis. The
rapid systemic clearance and short half-life (t1/2 o60 min) in
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment were consistent
with those observed in other PK studies of carfilzomib in
patients with hematologic or solid tumor malignancies.14,20
Concordant with the observation that renal clearance is not a
significant pathway for carfilzomib elimination, carfilzomib
recovered in urine samples within 24 h post-dosing represented
o1% of the total dose. The results of this study demonstrate that
carfilzomib can be safely administered at the same dose to
patients with MM regardless of their renal function.
The small number of patients in each group produced a very
large 90% CI in each PK comparison, due in large part to the
interpatient variability associated with rapid drug clearance. As
observed in animal studies,21 carfilzomib plasma concentration
declined rapidly immediately following the end of dosing.
Consequently, small differences in the timing of plasma sampling
at the end of dosing can substantially impact the observed Cmax,
which will then affect the calculated PK parameters including AUC
and clearance. In addition, variable infusion rate (infusion duration
from 2 to 10 min) will affect Cmax. Thus the CIs of the LSM ratios for
AUC and Cmax did not fall within the prespecified ranges. In
support of this analysis, a sensitivity analysis using the mixed-effects
linear regression model demonstrated that renal function, as
measured by CrCl, was not a statistically significant factor
affecting the observed PK parameters.
In the current trial in patients with varying degrees of renal
impairment, there was no appreciable difference in the type,
frequency, or severity of AEs compared with other carfilzomib
phase 2 trials, where patients had CrCl X30 ml/min.9,10,14,22,23
It should be noted that the challenges in administering the drug
were manageable. Most cases of congestive heart failure were
related to aggressive hydration and three patients safely continued
on the study once hydration was adjusted, suggesting, at least
clinically, that the drug does not have direct cardiac effects. In
addition, ECGs showed no changes related to carfilzomib, regardless
of the level of renal impairment. As seen in all phase 2 MM studies
with carfilzomib to date, Grade X3 AEs in the present trial were
predominantly related to hematologic, respiratory, constitutional
and electrolyte systems.24 Likewise, the low rate of treatment￾emergent neuropathy in this study is consistent with previous
studies with single-agent carfilzomib, providing further evidence
that carfilzomib does not cause or exacerbate neuropathy.12 The
case of venoocclusive liver disease is probably a random or
multifactorial event that followed respiratory failure requiring
intubation complicating an infection and right ventricular failure.
No other cases of venoocclusive disease have been observed in
over 500 patients treated in phase 2 trials.

Renal impairment and carfilzomib pharmacokinetics

Most patients who experienced irreversible worsening of renal
function had clear evidence of progressive myeloma. The dose of
carfilzomib was safely escalated to 27 mg/m2
—the dose used in
patients with normal renal function—and did not appear to be
associated with clinically relevant nephrotoxicity. This is different
from what is reported for other therapies for MM such as high￾dose melphalan and lenalidomide.25 Both are dependent on renal
function for clearance, and dose modification is recommended
based on severity of renal impairment to minimize hematologic
toxicity. The results of the current study suggest that carfilzomib,
like bortezomib,26 is not likely to require dose or schedule
modifications in patients with MM and renal impairment.
The PD analysis confirms prolonged and substantial (73–87%)
proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib in patients with renal
impairment, as seen in previous studies.14,15 In support of this,
among these patients with relapsed and refractory MM and
various degrees of renal impairment, treatment with carfilzomib
resulted in clinically significant responses. Notably, one of the
patients on hemodialysis who had a PR also had improvement in
renal function that enabled him to discontinue dialysis. The overall
responses noted are quite impressive in these heavily pretreated
patients, approximately half of whom were refractory to both
bortezomib and lenalidomide. Interestingly, similar to results
reported with bortezomib,27 improved responses were noted in
roughly one-third of patients who received dexamethasone
X20 mg (40 mg per week). Moreover, the addition of
dexamethasone did not increase overall toxicity of carfilzomib.
In summary, the results of this open-label, nonrandomized
study indicate that carfilzomib dose and treatment schedule do
not need to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment. The
study design and subgroups were maximized to detect differ￾ences in PK findings and safety signals, as opposed to efficacy.
Further clinical evaluations to substantiate and extend these initial
findings are ongoing, including evaluating the impact of renal
impairment on combination therapy (for example, carfilzomib
with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone, CRd), which has
shown promising safety and efficacy to date in patients with
MM.28,29
