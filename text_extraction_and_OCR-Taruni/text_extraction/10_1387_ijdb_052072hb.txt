ABSTRACT Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have enormous potential as a source of cells for
cell replacement therapies and as a model for early human development. In this study we
examined the differentiating potential of hESCs into hepatocytes in two- and three-dimensional
(2D and 3D) culture systems. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were inserted into a collagen scaffold 3D
culture system or cultured on collagen-coated dishes and stimulated with exogenous growth
factors to induce hepatic histogenesis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the expression of
albumin (ALB) and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18). The differentiated cells in 2D and 3D culture system
displayed several characteristics of hepatocytes, including expression of transthyretin, α-1-
antitrypsin, cytokeratin 8, 18, 19, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, tyrosine aminotransferase, glu￾cose-6-phosphatase (G6P), cytochrome P450 subunits 7a1 and secretion of alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) and ALB and production of urea. In 3D culture, ALB and G6P were detected earlier and higher
levels of urea and AFP were produced, when compared with 2D culture. Electron microscopy of
differentiated hESCs showed hepatocyte-like ultrastructure, including glycogon granules, well￾developed Golgi apparatuses, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticuli and intercellular canaliculi.
The differentiation of hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells within 3D collagen scaffolds containing
exogenous growth factors, gives rise to cells displaying morphological features, gene expression
patterns and metabolic activities characteristic of hepatocytes and may provide a source of
differentiated cells for treatment of liver diseases.

Introduction
Currently, there is much interest in the generation of mature
hepatocyte from stem cells. Hepatocyte transplantation has
been shown to be a plausible treatment for human metabolic
liver diseases (Fox et al., 1998). However, primary cultures of
hepatocytes either do not replicate sufficiently in vitro to pro￾duce the number of cells necessary for transplantation or do not
maintain their differentiated properties in vitro (Jones et al.,
2002). Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have an enor￾mous potential as a source of cells for cell-replacement thera￾pies and as a model for early human development. These cells
proliferate extensively in vitro in an undifferentiated state and
maintain a normal karyotype. They also have the potential to
differentiate into a variety of cell lineages (i.e., ectodermal,
mesodermal and endodermal) (for review see Hoffman and
Carpenter, 2005). Directed differentiation of hESCs is a useful

tool to analyze the mechanisms controlling development of
mammalian organs. It has recently been shown that endoder￾mal differentiation toward the hepatic cell lineage may occur
following spontaneous differentiation of hESCs (Itskovitz-Eldor
et al., 2000; Schuldiner et al., 2000). Mouse ESCs have also
been shown to differentiate into mature hepatocytes by growth
factors (Hamazaki et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2002). In addition,
mouse ESC-derived hepatocytes have been transplanted into
animal models of liver injury, resulting in improved liver function
(Kumashiro et al., 2005; Teramoto et al., 2005; Yamamoto et
al., 2003). Research investigating hepatic differentiation from
hESCs has been limited (Lavon et al., 2004; Rambhatla et al.,
2003). Human ESCs could provide a source of hepatocytes

suitable for cell transplantation and a useful model to study
hepatic differentiation in vitro.
Recent tissue engineering studies using three-dimensional
(3D) scaffold systems have demonstrated their effectiveness in
culturing ESCs in vitro. Three dimensional culture conditions
may mimic the in vivo environment more closely, with reports
indicating distinct cellular behavior within 3D culture systems
that are not observed in standard monolayer cultures or 2D
(Levenberg et al., 2003; Levenberg et al., 2005). In the present
study, we analyzed the potential of hESCs to differentiate into
hepatocytes within 2D and 3D collagen culture systems and

Results
Morphology of hESC–derived hepatocyte-like cells
Embryoid bodies formed by the suspension culture
were implanted into the 3D space of collagen scaffolds or
collagen-coated dishes (2D) system and then stimulated
with exogenous growth factors. Cell morphology was
assayed in 2D and 3D culture systems by phase contrast
microscopy at early (Fig. 1 A,C) and late (Fig. 1 B,D)
stages of differentiation. The 2D EBs proliferated under
the in vitro conditions and by day 20 displayed morpho￾logical characteristics of hepatocyte-like cells, binuclei
and polyhedral contours (Fig. 1B). Cells in the 3D culture
system migrated out of aggregates and formed cordlike
and multilayer structures and which were not observed in
the 2D cultures (Fig. 1D).
Immunocytochemical and immunohisto-chemichal
staining
To confirm in vitro hepatic differentiation from EBs, we
analyzed expression of ALB (the most abundant protein
synthesized by functional hepatocytes) and CK-18 (a
cytokeratin indicative of hepatocyte morphology). The
differentiated hESCs stained positively for both CK-18
(Fig. 2 A-F) and ALB (Fig. 2 C-H) in 2D and 3D culture

systems at day 22. The positive cells had large nuclei and
polyhedral contours. Some of the positive cells were binuclear
(Fig. 2F). The percentages of ALB and CK-18-positive cells were
15±7 % and 14±5 % in 2D and 18±10 % and 16±6 % in 3D
spontaneously differentiated hESCs, respectively. Using the ex￾ogenous growth factors, the ALB and CK-18-positive cells could
be further increased into 48±10 % and 52±8 % in 2D and 46±13
% and 50±6 % in 3D culture systems, respectively (P< 0.01).
Endoderm and hepatic specific gene expression
The mRNA expression of endodermal and hepatocyte-specific
genes, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β), α-fetopro￾tein (AFP), albumin (ALB), transthyretin (TTR), α-1-antitrypsin
(AAT), cytokeratins (CK-8, CK-18 and CK-19), tryptophan-2,3-
dioxygenase (TDO), tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) glucose-6-
phosphatase (G6P) and cytochrome P450 subunits 7a1 (Cyp7a1)
was observed during hESCs differentiation (Fig. 3A). In this study,
the undifferentiated hESCs did not express mRNA of the endo￾dermal or hepatocyte lineage genes, although, the hESCs ex￾pressed OCT4, a pluripotent marker, CK-19, which is expressed
in biliary epithelial cells and hepatoblasts and HNF3β, which is a
liver-enriched transcription factor (Ishizaka et al., 2002). We
found that OCT-4 was down-regulated during differentiation and
endodermal and hepatocyte-specific genes were upregulated
upon differentiation. Figure 3, shows the expression of TTR, AAT,
AFP, TDO, CK-18 and Cyp7a1 at day 8 of differentiation in both
2D and 3D cultures. In the 3D culture system, mRNA expression
of ALB and G6P was detected earlier than that detected in 2D
culture. Some of these markers are also expressed in visceral
endoderm, which is known to be present in differentiating hESCs
cultures. Thus we analyzed the expression of the hepatic-specific
marker,Cyp7a1 (Asahina et al., 2004). Additionally we compared
liver-specific gene expression profiles between differentiated
hESCs with and without exogenous growth factors in 2D and 3D
cultures and found that the differentiating hESCs without exog￾enous growth factors expressed endodermal-specific genes such
as HNF3β, AFP, TTR, AAT, CK-8, CK-18, CK-19, TDO, ALB and
Cyp7a1, but not,G6P and TAT at day 24 (Fig. 3B).
Alpha-fetoprotein, albumin and urea production
Alpha-fetoprotein was not secreted by hESCs, whereas con￾tinuously increased during differentiation in 3D and 2D culture
systems, with a noted increase observed at days 24 (P< 0.01) and
28 (P< 0.05) in presence of exogenous growth factors compared
with spontaneously differentiated hESCs. In addition, AFP pro￾duction with exogenous growth factors in 3D culture system is
significantly higher than 2D culture system at day 28 (P< 0.05). No
significant difference in AFP secretion was detected between
different treatments prior to day 20 (Fig. 4A). Undifferentiated
hESCs did not secrete ALB, whereas after induction of hepatic
differentiation, ALB secretion continuously increased in 3D and
2D culture systems and reached maximal values at day 24.
However, there was not significant difference in all groups. In
addition, detection of urea production was performed to confirm
whether differentiated hESCs within 2D and 3D culture systems
could support and maintain hepatic metabolic functions. Urea
production was significantly increased in 3D culture compared
with 2D culture at days 18 (P< 0.01), 22(P< 0.001) and 28(P<
0.01). Urea production in spontaneous differentiated cells was
also significantly lower than cultures with additional growth fac￾tors (Fig. 4C, day 18: P< 0.01, days 22 and 28: P< 0.001). Urea
production by undifferentiated hESCs was not detected (data not
shown).
Glycogen synthesis
Glycogen storage was determined by PAS staining in hepatic￾like cells cultured within 3D culture system at day 20 (Fig. 5B).
Spontaneously differentiated cells werenegative for PAS staining
(Fig. 5A). Positively stained glycogen granules were detected in
the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 5C).
Indocyanine green cellular uptake
Indocyanine green (ICG) is an organic anion that is clinically
used as a test substance to evaluate liver function since it is
nontoxic and eliminated exclusively by hepatocytes (Yamada et
al., 2002). In the present study, we examined cellular uptake of
ICG to identify differentiated hepatocyte-like cells. On day 20 of
EB culture, ICG-positive cells were detected in abundance in 2D
and 3D culture systems (Fig 5 E,F). Cellular uptake of ICG in
spontaneous differentiated cells was low (Fig. 5D) and undifferen￾tiated hESCs were negative for ICG (data not shown).

P450 subunit 7a1 (Cyp7a1), OCT4 and GAPDH (internal control) during in
vitro differentiation are shown at days 0, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. In the 3D
culture system, mRNA expression of ALB and G6P were detected earlier
than in the 2D culture system. The G6P and TAT genes were not
expressed in spontaneous differentiated cultures. The human hepatoma
cell line (hepG2) was used as positive control. Tests were repeated in
triplicate and for each assay was performed independently two times.

Ultrastructural characteristics of hepatocyte-like cells
In collagen scaffold cultures, semi-thin sections stained with
toluidine blue showing hepatocyte-like cells in direct contact with
adjacent cells (Fig. 5). Ultrastructural studies of differentiated
cells revealed that cell ultrastructure was similar to hepatocytes
(Ishii et al., 2005; Yamada et al., 2002). Numerous mitochondria,
lysosomes, prominent nucleoli, well-developed Golgi appara￾tuses and rough and smooth endoplasmic reticuli (rES and sER)
were observed in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 5 B-E). The
nuclei were occasionally irregular in shape and typically dis￾played a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Interdigitation of
cytoplasmic extensions was observed between adjacent cells
(Fig. 5E). Bile canaliculi were also occasionally observed be￾tween adjacent cells. Glycogon granules were also detected in
the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 5 C,E).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the endodermal and hepatic
differentiation of hESCs within a 3D collagen scaffold-culture
system and in a 2D monolayer culture system, on collagen￾coated dishes supplemented with exogenous growth factors. The
mRNA expression of endodermal and hepatocyte-specific genes
was detected at varying stages of hESC differentiation. Differen￾tiated cells were found to produce urea, secrete ALB and AFP,
store glycogens and ICG uptake, indicative of differentiation of
hESCs into functional hepatocyte-like cells. Furthermore, differ￾entiated hESCs showed distinctive ultrastructural features char￾acteristic of hepatocytes. Recently, it was reported that mouse
ESCs can generate cells displaying hepatocyte characteristics
upon spontaneous differentiation (Hamazaki et al., 2001; Jones
et al., 2002). Human ESCs can also spontaneously differentiate
into endoderm in vitro and thus may be an additional useful model
to use for producing endodermal and hepatic cell types (Jones et
al., 2002). Most recently, Lavon et al. (2004) analyzed the
capacity of hESCs to differentiate into hepatocytes by using
suspension culture of EBs for 20 days and then dissociated and
plated these EBs for an additional 10 days with aFGF. In another
study, Rambhatla et al. (2003) induced hepatic differentiation by
treatment with sodium butyrate. In the present study, we used 5-
day-old EBs and induced differentiation using a method as
described by Hamazaki et al. (2001) in 2D and 3D collagen
matrix. Teratani et al. (2005), examined matrix-dependent he￾patic cell growth which indicated that mouse ESC-derived hepa￾tocytes are sensitive to extracellular matrix component types and
that type I collagen may be optimal for directing mouse ESCs
toward the hepatocyte lineage. Another study evaluated the
effect of 3D culture on hepatocyte differentiation in mouse ESCs,
although did not determine the functional properties of differen￾tiated mouse ESCs (Imamura et al., 2004).
The hepatic endoderm develops next to the cardiac mesoderm
and is affected by secreted factors from the mesodermal cells
during normal development (Zaret, 2001; Zaret, 2002). The
growth factors, aFGF and bFGF are secreted from the cardiac
mesoderm at the time of hepatic induction. The response to this
factor is restricted to the endoderm tissue, which uniquely ex￾presses the receptors for these factors (Jung et al., 1999). When
visceral endoderm and hepatic differentiation were examined by
gene expression during in vitro mouse ESC differentiation, an

early marker, TTR, was detected within 3 days following growth
factors treatment. The markers, AFP and AAT were detected at
days 6 to 9. Alpha-fetoprotein is a marker of endodermal differen￾tiation and an early fetal hepatic marker (Hamazaki et al., 2001;
Hu et al., 2004). TTR, AAT and AFP represent endodermal
differentiation and hepatocytes. Albumin mRNA expression was
first detected at day 12 (Hamazaki and Terada, 2003). In addition,
CK-8 and CK-18 which are involved in maintaining the skeleton
structure of hepatocytes and epithelial cells are expressed in the
cytoplasm of differentiating fetal liver in vivo (Hu et al., 2004;
Hamazaki and Terada, 2003). G6P and TAT are predominantly
expressed in the liver during late gestation and are considered the
markers of hepatic mature differentiation (Hamazaki et al., 2001).
In this study, differentiating hESCs without exogenous growth
factors expressed the endodermal specific genes AFP, TTR,
AAT, CK-8, CK-18, CK-19 and ALB, but not G6P and TAT at later
stages of differentiation. Our findings indicate that AFP, ALB and
urea production by hESCs-derived cells during differentiation was
significantly lower during spontaneous differentiation, compared
with culture containing exogenous growth factors, which indicates
that hESCs can spontaneously differentiate into visceral endo￾dermal cells or early hepatic lineage cells. However, their ability
to differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells is poor. In
addition, the expression of CK-19 (Tan et al., 2002) did not alter
during differentiation, suggesting the presence of hepatic pro￾genitors or incomplete differentiation into biliary epithelial cells.
The expression of liver-specific serum proteingenes such as ALB,
AFP and TTR, as well as the endoderm-specific transcription
factor gene, HNF3β, can be found in the yolk sac, a derivative of
the extra embryonic endoderm, as well as in the fetal liver. Thus,
these markers are insufficient to prove in vitro differentiation into
hepatocytes, though they can be used to show early endoderm
commitment in EBs derived from ESCs (Yamada et al., 2002;
Asahina et al., 2004). In addition, Cyp7a1 was identified as a liver￾specific gene that was not expressed in the yolk sac (Asahina et
al., 2004). In the present study, we found that the expression of the
liver-specific gene Cyp7a1 is induced in culture with exogenous
growth factors. These results demonstrate that hESCs can differ￾entiate in vitro into hepatocytes derived from definitive endoderm.
By electron microscopy hepatocyte-like cells in the collagen
scaffolds had a immature organization of intracellular organelles
and architecture including rER, sER, Golgi apparatus and inter￾cellular canaliculi, glycogen particles and lysosomes. Tight junc￾tions and gap junctions were formed around the bile canaliculi.
Intercellular canaliculi developed well and some formed bile
canaliculus-like structures (Ishii et al., 2005; Yamada et al., 2002).
To determine whether cells with morphological and phenotypic
characteristics of hepatocyte-like cells also acquired functional
properties, a number of functional assays were performed to
investigate metabolic functions of hepatocytes such as urea
production and AFP and ALB secretion. In comparison with 2D
culture, earlier gene expression patterns of ALB and G6P and
higher detection levels of urea and AFP in 3D culture systems
suggest that 3D culture systems provide a microenvironment that
is conducive to normal progenitor cell kinetics and enhanced cell
differentiation. The advantages of using 3D tissue culture sys￾tems include the ability to mimic in vivo histoarchitecture, easy
manipulation of cells or tissues and an optimal used to promote
cell-to-cell and/or matrix interactions (Imamura et al., 2004).
In conclusion, our findings illustrate that hESC differentiation in
3D culture systems more closely resemble the in vivo environ￾ment in regards to inducing correct cell morphology, cellular
environment, gene expression and biological behavior of the
cells. Human ESCs may provide an alternative source of hepato￾Fig. 5. Glycogen storage determined by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and cellular uptake of indocyanine green. (A) Spontaneously

Materials and Methods
Culture of human ESCs
The hESC line, Royan H1 (Baharvand et al., 2004) was cultured on
mitomycin-C (Sigma) treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders,
plated on gelatin (Sigma)-coated tissue culture dishes (Falcon). Human
ESCs were maintained in hESC medium (80 % Knockout Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (KO-DMEM; Gibco/BRL) supplemented with 20
% ES-qualified fetal calf serum (ES-FCS Gibco/BRL), 2 mM glutamine
(Gibco), 0.1 mM β–mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 1 % nonessential amino
acid stock (Gibco/BRL), 5 mg/ml insulin, 5 µg/ml transferrin, 5 µg/ml
selenium (ITS, Gibco/BRL), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomy￾cin (Gibco/BRL). The cells were grown in 5 % CO2 and 95 % humidity and
then mechanically passaged on fresh mitomycin-treated MEFs approxi￾mately every seven days.
Induction of hepatic differentiation in vitro
 To induce differentiation, the colonies of hESCs were mechanically
dissociated (300-500 cells) and cultured as individual pieces in “hanging
drops” (20 µl) for 2 days in hESC medium to produce EBs. Formed EBs
were transferred into suspension culture containing same medium in 100
mm petri dishes and cultured for an additional 3 days. The EBs were then
cultured in 24-well tissue culture dishes containing a 3D scaffold, Vitrogen
(type I collagen, Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA, USA) (2 mm height). Using a
stereomicroscope, an incision of about 0.1 mm was made in each
collagen scaffold and 5 EBs were implanted into the incision. As controls,
EBs were also cultured on collagen-coated dishes as a 2D culture system.
Several growth factors were added into the culture medium at varying
days following differentiation including, acidic fibroblast growth factors
(aFGF, R&D Systems) (100 ng/ml) added on day 9 until day 12 to induce
hepatic differentiation. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, R&D Systems)
(20 ng/ml) was then added from day 12 until day 20, as a mid-stage factor.
Oncostatin M (OSM, R&D Systems) (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (Dex,
Sigma) (10-7 M), 5 mg/ml insulin, 5 mg/ml transferrin and 5 µg/ml selenium
(ITS, Gibco/BRL) were added as late stage factors from day 15 until day
20. Cells were cultured until day 28. As a control treatment, in vitro
spontaneous differentiation was induced in hESCs by culture within the
2D and/or 3D systems in the absence of growth factors for 28 days.
Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical staining
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded collagen gels were cut into 4-µm￾thick sections and mounted on glass slides coated with poly-L-lysine. The
sections were deparafinized in xylene and rehydrated in 100, 96 and 70
% ethanol for 5 min and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
sections were incubated in blocking buffer (0.1 M PBS containing 0.5 %
normal goat serum, 0.2 % Triton X-100) for 1 h and thereafter in primary
antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C diluted in blocking buffer. The antibodies used
in this study were mouse monoclonal anti-albumin (ALB, 1:200 R&D
Systems) and mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 18 (CK-18, 1:200
Chemicon). Adjacent sections served as negative controls and were
processed using identical procedures, except for incubation without the
primary antibody. The secondary antibody used was IgG FITC-conju￾gated goat anti-mouse (1:100, Sigma). Incubation with the secondary
antibody was performed at 25 °C for 30 min. to prepare 2D cultured cells
for immunostaining, cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed using 4 %
paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Cells were cultured in PBS containing 1 %
goat serum to inhibit unspecific labeling (30 min at room temperature) and
labeled with primary and secondary antibodies as described above. Cells
were counterstained with 5 mg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed using
the fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51, Japan). The percentages
of immunopositive cells relative to total number of propidium iodide￾labelled cells were recorded.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the NucleoSpin®
RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Prior to reverse transcrip￾tion (RT), RNA samples were digested with DNase I (EN0521;
Fermentas) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Extracted RNA

was treated by DNase I (EN0521; Fermentas) to avoid cross contami￾nation of RNA by genomic DNA. Standard RT was performed using 2
µg total RNA, oligo (dT)18 and the RevertAidTM H Minus First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622; Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cDNA samples were subjected to polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification using human specific primers designed
using different exons (Table 1). Amplification conditions were as
follows: Initial denaturation at 94˚C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94˚C for 30 sec, annealing at 59-70˚C for 45 sec (see
table refer to temperatures used), extension for 45 sec at 72°C and a
final polymerization at 72˚C for 10 min. The PCRs were performed in
triplicate. The PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on
1.5% agarose and stained with ethidium bromide (10 µg/ml) and
visualized and photographed on a UV transluminator (Uvidoc, UK). As
a positive control, human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, (Pasteur Insti￾tute, Tehran, Iran) was used.
Alpha-fetoprotein and albumin production
Conditioned media from the differentiated hESCs cultured both with
and without exogenous growth factors in 2D and 3D cultures (5 EBs in
every well of 24-wells dishes) were collected at days 0, 8, 12, 16, 20,
24 and 28 and frozen at -20°C until assay. The conditioned media were
assayed for AFP production using a chemiluminescence Immunoassay
kit (Diasorin-Liaison) and for ALB production using a quantitative
enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Albumin ELISA, Orgentech
Diagnostica, Germany) according to manufacturer’s recommenda￾tions. The conditioned media of undifferentiated hESCs (day 0) was
used as a negative control.
Urea production
The hESCs (5 EBs per well in 24-well dish) were incubated with 1 mL
medium containing 5 mM NH4Cl (Sigma) for 24 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C on
days 18, 22 and 28. Following this incubation, supernatant was collected
and Urea concentrations were measured by using a colorimetric assay kit
(Pars azmun, Iran). Undifferentiated hESCs (day 0) were used as a
negative control.
Periodic acid-Schiff staining for glycogen
Glycogen storage was evaluated using paraffin-embedded tissues.
Briefly, sections were oxidized in 1% periodic acid (Sigma) for 5 min and
rinsed three times in deionized water. Slides were then treated with
Periodic Acid Schiff’s (PAS) reagent (Sigma) for 15 min, rinsed in
deionized water for 5–10 min, stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma)
for 1 min and finally rinsed in deionized water.
Indocyanine green cellular uptake
To determine cellular uptake of indocyanine green (ICG), 1mg/ml of
indocyanine green (Sigma) in DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to
cell cultures at late stage of differentiation and incubated at 37°C for 15
min. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and cellular uptake of
ICG was examined. Cell dishes were then replated with fresh DMEM
containing 10% FBS. The ICG was undetected in cells 6 hours post
staining (Yamada et al., 2002).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The samples at day 24 were processed for TEM as previously
described (Baharvand et al., 2005). Briefly, the samples were fixed using

PRIMERS AND THE REACTION CONDITIONS FOR RT-PCR OF DIFFERENTIATING HEPATOCYTES FROM hESCs
TABLE 1

652 H. Baharvand et al.
2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h. After washing with
PBS, samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetra oxide for 1.5 h, again
washed in PBS, dehydrated in an acetone series and then embedded in
epoxy resin. After resin polymerization, sections of approximately 50 nm
were cut and double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron
micrographs were taken using a Zeiss EM 900 transmission electron
microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results were given as
means±standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by
using a Student’s t test with significance reported when P <0.05. For
quantitative evaluation of ALB and CK-18 positive cells, at least 700 PI
positive cells were analyzed.
