We report survival outcomes for patients with advanced-stage
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein thrombosis (PVT)
treated with 90Y radioembolization. Methods: With institutional re￾view board approval, we searched our prospectively acquired da￾tabase for 90Y patients treated between 2003 and 2017. Inclusion
criteria were patients who had HCC with tumor PVT. Patients with
metastases were excluded. Laboratory data were collected at base￾line and 1 mo after 90Y radioembolization. Toxicity grades were
reported according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Ad￾verse Events, version 4.0, and long-term survival outcomes were
reported and stratified by Child–Pugh class (CP). Overall survival
was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Multivariate analy￾sis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A
subanalysis for patients with a high level of α-fetoprotein (AFP)
(.100 ng/dL) was conducted. Results: In total, 185 patients with
HCC PVT underwent 90Y radioembolization. Seventy-four (40%)
were CP-A, 51 (28%) were CP-B7, and 60 (32%) were $CP-B8.
New albumin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase grade 3/4 toxic￾ities were, respectively, 3%, 10%, and 0% for CP-A; 14%, 12%,
and 6% for CP-B7; and 23%, 32%, and 3% for $CP-B8. Median
overall survival for CP-A patients was 13.3 mo (95% confidence
interval [CI], 8.7–15.7 mo). CP-B7 and $CP-B8 patients exhibited
median overall survival of 6.9 mo (95% CI, 5.3–10.1 mo) and 3.9 mo
(95% CI, 2.9–5.0 mo), respectively. Significant overall survival prog￾nosticators on univariate analysis were albumin, bilirubin, ascites,
tumor size 5 cm or smaller, focality, distribution, infiltration, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group status, AFP level, and PVT extent.
Multivariate analysis showed the prognosticators of overall survival
to be bilirubin, no ascites, tumor size 5 cm or smaller, solitary lesion,
baseline AFP level lower than 100 ng/dL, and Eastern Coopera￾tive Oncology Group status. Of 123 patients with a high AFP level
(.100 ng/dL), 12 patients achieved restored normal AFP levels
(,13 ng/dL) and exhibited median overall survival of 23.9 mo
(95% CI, 20.1–124.1 mo). AFP responders at 1 mo had better overall
survival than nonresponders, at 8.5 mo versus 4.8 mo (P 5 0.018);
AFP responders at 3 mo had overall survival of 13.3 mo, versus 6.9
mo for nonresponders (P 5 0.021). Conclusion: 90Y radioemboliza￾tion can serve as a safe and effective treatment for advanced-stage
HCC patients with tumor PVT. Overall survival outcomes are af￾fected by baseline liver function, tumor size, and AFP level.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
malignancy worldwide, with a marked increase in prevalence in
the United States within the past 50 y (1,2). It is the most common
primary liver malignancy and the second most common cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide (3). Because of comorbidities, un￾derlying poor liver function, large tumor size, and late-stage presentation,
only 10% of HCC patients can receive curative treatments (4).
An estimated 7%–15% of HCC patients present with infiltrative
disease (5). Most of those patients present with portal vein thrombosis
(PVT). Therefore, they are not typically considered candidates for
possible curative treatments (resection, transplantation), given that the
presence of PVT significantly increases the chances of extrahepatic
spread and decreases overall survival (6). 90Y radioembolization has
previously been found to be a safe and promising treatment for
HCC patients with PVT. Because the treatment is microembolic,
it maintains the hepatic vasculature intact (7).
There are several treatment options for HCC patients with PVT.
The current standard of care for these patients is sorafenib (8).
Regorafenib also has been proven to provide a survival benefit for
HCC patients who progressed during sorafenib treatment (9). Other
systemic treatments, such as erlotinib, have failed to provide im￾proved survival when added to sorafenib (10). Although contrain￾dicated for patients with PVT, transarterial chemoembolization is
still used (11–13).
This study reports on the largest cohort of HCC patients with
PVT (without metastases) treated with 90Y radioembolization.

cohort of consecutive HCC patients who were treated with 90Y
radioembolization at our institution from December 2003 to March
2017. To isolate the appropriate cohort, we excluded patients who did
not exhibit PVT at baseline, and to reduce the confounding effect of
extrahepatic metastases on survival, we excluded patients who had
them. This resulted in the identification of 185 patients who demonstrated
PVT at baseline imaging. The sample was further subdivided by Child–
Pugh class (CP) (CP-A, CP-B7, $CP-B8). In a prior analysis, we reported
long-term outcomes for a 291-patent cohort that included 96 patients
with PVT-only disease. In this study, we shed light on our experience
in 185 PVT-only patients treated over a 14-y period (14).
Evaluation and Staging
The diagnosis of HCC was based on radiographic findings according
to guidelines or biopsy (15). Portal vein tumor thrombus was diagnosed
on the basis of enhancement during the arterial phase of contrast in￾jection during cross-sectional imaging (16). The location of PVT was
also assessed (segmental, lobar, main). Six patients with main PVT had
tumor thrombus extending to the superior mesenteric vein. These were
included in the main PVT group for the purposes of this study. Patients
were classified by CP, the criteria of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Criteria.
Patients had prior cross-sectional imaging that elucidated tumor
number, size, and location. Patient history, physical examination results,
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status were
assessed during initial clinic visits. The decision to treat patients with 90Y
was made during a weekly meeting of a multidisciplinary tumor board.
90Y Treatment
Tumor blood supply and lung shunt fraction were evaluated from
planning angiography and 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin imaging.
Radioembolization was then performed per standard methodology,
delivering a radiation dose of 80–150 Gy to the hepatic parenchyma
using glass microspheres (17,18).
AFP Producers
AFP producers within the cohort were defined as patients who had an
AFP level higher than 100 ng/mL at baseline. Their laboratory AFP
values were collected until their last day of follow-up. AFP responders
were defined as patients who had more than a 50% decrease in their AFP
level from baseline. Patients were also considered to have a normalized
AFP level if they achieved an AFP level of 13 ng/mL or less.
Laboratory Toxicities
Clinical and laboratory assessment was performed at baseline, 1–3 mo
after radioembolization, and every 3 mo thereafter. Laboratory toxicities
were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 4.0 (19). If patients already met these criteria at baseline
and the grade of toxicity did not progress after 90Y radioembolization,
the toxicity was considered not attributable to 90Y. Toxicities occurring
up to 6 mo after treatment (irrespective of disease progression) were
reported.
Statistical Analysis
Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Univariate analysis was conducted using the Kaplan–Meier method
and the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox
proportional hazards regression. All statistical analyses were con￾ducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 24.

Survival Stratified by CP
Table 3 shows survival stratified by CP.
CP-A patients (n 5 74) had a median overall survival of 13.3
mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7–15.7 mo). When substrati￾fied by location of PVT, survival was 14.3 mo (95% CI, 12.0–17.8
mo) for segmental, 14.2 mo (95% CI, 7.3–19.5 mo) for lobar, and
7.7 mo (95% CI, 4.6–13.8 mo) for main (P 5 0.78). Patients with
an AFP level of more than 100 ng/mL had a survival of 7.8 mo
(95% CI, 6.9–15 mo), compared with 15.6 mo (95% CI, 13.2–20.7
mo; P 5 0.16) for an AFP level of 100 ng/mL or less. A baseline
tumor size of 5 cm or less had a survival of 14.2 mo (95% CI, 11.4–
24 mo), and a baseline tumor larger than 5 cm had a survival of
11.7 mo (95% CI, 7.8–17.7 mo; P 5 0.27) (Supplemental Fig. 1;
supplemental materials are available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org).
CP-B7 patients (n 5 51) had a median overall survival of 6.9 mo
(95% CI, 5.3–10.1 mo). When substratified by location of PVT,
survival was 6.5 mo (95% CI, 3.4–38 mo) for segmental, 6.9 mo
(95% CI, 4.6–13.3 mo) for lobar, and 7.7 mo (95% CI, 4.8–11.1
mo) for main (P 5 0.82). Patients with an AFP level of more than
100 ng/mL had a survival of 6.4 mo (95% CI, 4.6–10.4 mo), compared
with 7.9 mo (95% CI, 6.4–14.4 mo; P 5 0.94) for an AFP level of
100 ng/mL or less. A baseline tumor size of 5 cm or less had a
survival of 14.4 mo (95% CI, 6.9–20.1 mo), compared with 6.4 mo
(95% CI, 4.8–8.1 mo; P 5 0.04) for a baseline tumor larger than
5 cm (Supplemental Fig. 2).
$CP-B8 patients (n 5 60) had a median overall survival of 3.9
mo (95% CI, 2.9–5.0 mo). When substratified by location of PVT,
survival was 8.4 mo (95% CI, 1.2–75.2 mo) for segmental, 4.4 mo
(95% CI, 2.5–9.7 mo) for lobar, and 3.4 mo (95% CI, 2.5–4.6 mo)
for main (P 5 0.015). Patients with an AFP level of more than
100 ng/mL had a survival of 3.3 mo (95% CI, 2.3–4.8 mo), com￾pared with 4.8 mo (95% CI, 4.1–9.5 mo; P 5 0.09) for an AFP of
100 ng/mL or less. A baseline tumor size of 5 cm or less had a
survival of 12.6 mo (95% CI, 2.3–21.7 mo), and a baseline tumor
larger than 5 cm had a survival of 3.6 mo (95% CI, 2.3–4.8 mo;
P 5 0.01) (Supplemental Fig. 3).
Univariate and Multivariate Analyses
Univariate survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier method
and the log-rank test showed a statistically significant survival
benefit in patients with a baseline albumin level of more than
3.5 g/dL (P 5 0.002), a baseline bilirubin level of less than 2 mg/dL
(P , 0.0001), absence of ascites (P 5 0.0015), a tumor size of 5 cm or
less (P 5 0.0007), a solitary lesion (P 5 0.001), unilobar disease (P 5
0.0015), noninfiltrative tumors (P 5 0.01), Eastern Cooperative On￾cology Group status 0 or 1 (P 5 0.0001), and a baseline AFP level of
less than 100 ng/dL (P 5 0.05). Patients who had either segmental or
lobar PVT had better survival outcomes than patients with PVT
involving the main portal vein (P 5 0.008).
Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression
showed a bilirubin level of less than 2 mg/dL, a bilirubin level of
2–3 mg/dL, absence of ascites, a tumor size of 5 cm or less, a
solitary lesion, a baseline AFP level of less than 100 ng/dL, and
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0 or 1 to be signifi￾cant prognosticators of survival (Table 4).
Patients who were AFP producers (n 5 123) were also analyzed.
At 1 mo after 90Y radioembolization, 101 patients were followed up;
AFP nonresponders (n 5 52) had a median overall survival of 4.8 mo
(95% CI, 3.7–7.7 mo), versus 8.5 mo (95% CI, 6.5–14.3 mo; P 5 0.018)
for AFP responders (n 5 49). At 3 mo after 90Y radioembolization,
65 patients had follow-up laboratory tests; AFP nonresponders (n 5 22)

responders (n 5 43) had a survival of 13.3 mo (95% CI, 8.7–17.7 mo;
P 5 0.021). AFP producers with a normalized AFP level at any follow￾up time (n 5 12) had a survival of 23.9 mo (95% CI, 20–124 mo),
whereas nonnormalized AFP producers (n 5 89) had a survival of
6.4 mo (95% CI, 4.9–7.8 mo; P , 0.0001) (Supplemental Table 1).
DISCUSSION
HCC patients presenting with PVT have limited treatment
options because the tumor and underlying liver cirrhosis are further
complicated by the development of PVT. Further, unless they have
preserved liver function (CP-A), they are precluded from most
clinical trials and systemic agents (15). Our results indicate that 90Y
radioembolization brought about a clinically meaningful increase
in overall survival for HCC patients with PVT (predominantly
those with preserved liver function), when compared with pub￾lished outcomes with systemic agents.
Many treatments have been implicated in palliating or pro￾viding a survival benefit for patients with advanced-stage HCC.
Sorafenib, a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor, remains the
systemic treatment of choice for advanced-HCC patients. A

90Y RADIOEMBOLIZATION FOR HCC WITH PVT • Abouchaleh et al. 1045

randomized controlled trial of sorafenib for advanced-HCC
patients found that it increased overall survival and median time
to radiologic progression by almost 3 mo, when compared with the
placebo group (20). Another phase III trial found that sorafenib
demonstrated improved survival in HCC patients with both macro￾vascular invasion and metastatic disease (21,22). Recently, Bruix
et al. found that regorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor, pro￾vided a survival benefit for HCC patients with PVT who tolerated
sorafenib but progressed while on therapy (9). The study popula￾tion included only CP-A patients. The regorafenib group showed
an overall survival of 10.6 mo, in comparison to 7.8 mo for the
placebo group (9). Johnson et al. found that brivanib, a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, demonstrated overall survival and time to progression
similar to sorafenib as a first line of treatment, but sorafenib was better
tolerated than brivanib (23). Nivolumab, a programmed cell death
protein 1–blocking antibody, has shown promising preliminary results
as both a first-line and a second-line systemic therapy for advanced￾stage HCC (24). 90Y radioembolization has proved to be the locoregional treat￾ment of choice in cases with portal vein invasion (25). The small
size of 90Y glass microspheres (30 mm) allows for deep infiltration
into the tumor without ischemia of the hepatic parenchyma (7).
Occluding arterial flow to a hepatic region that has no portal
venous flow because of malignant portal vein invasion could result
in complete loss of blood supply and unfavorable outcomes. More￾over, for most late-stage HCC patients, maintenance of hepatic blood
flow is a priority to preserve liver function. Theoretically, this makes
a microembolic therapy appealing in such a scenario (26).

Until recently, there were no studies comparing 90Y radioembo￾lization and sorafenib as a sole treatment for advanced-stage HCC.
However, a new clinical study comparing 90Y resin microspheres
to sorafenib found that the median overall survival for the 90Y
radioembolization arm was not improved over the sorafenib arm.
Additionally, there was no significant difference in progression￾free survival between the 2 groups (27). There were, however,
significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to therapy
safety, toxicity profile, and quality of life. Patients treated with 90Y
radioembolization had fewer and less severe treatment-related side
effects and displayed toxicity and tolerability advantages. 90Y
patients also sustained their health status, whereas sorafenib pa￾tients had a significant decline in quality of life (27,28). The low
toxicity profile makes 90Y radioembolization a promising therapy
for treatment-na¨ıve late-stage HCC patients.
For CP-A and CP-B7, there was no significant difference in
survival among segmental, branch, and main PVT. This finding is
interesting because previous studies have repeatedly shown that
patients with branch PVT had a significantly longer survival than
those with main PVT (29). For CP-A patients, baseline tumor size
was not a prognosticator of survival. This result could indicate that
as long as PVT patients display preserved liver function, 90Y
radioembolization can be an effective treatment for such patients.
For CP-B7 and $CP-B8 patients, tumor size was related to survival.
Patients with tumors smaller than 5 cm had significantly longer
survivals than patients with larger tumors, indicating that the 5-cm
mark is significant in assessing tumor size before treatment.
AFP responders (baseline AFP level . 100 ng/mL) had signif￾icantly better survival at the 1-mo and 3-mo landmarks than AFP
nonresponders, irrespective of CP. Patients with high AFP levels
that became normalized after 90Y radioembolization had a large
survival benefit when compared with nonnormalized AFP producers.
It has been found that AFP response after locoregional therapy can
be used as a tool to assess tumor response, survival, and progression
(30). More specifically, AFP was correlated with the imaging re￾sponse and survival criteria of the European Association for the
Study of the Liver (31). Future studies should investigate whether
changes in AFP level can predict survival in PVT patients.
Previous studies have shown that a significant number of CP-A
PVT patients treated with 90Y radioembolization eventually pro￾gressed to CP-B/C (29). This finding suggests that CP-A patients
have a limited interval after 90Y radioembolization but before
disease progression during which they are still eligible for sys￾temic agents by CP. The concept of 90Y radioembolization followed
by adjuvant systemic treatment should be investigated (32).
A few comments about the recently reported SARAH and
SIRVENIB trials are warranted, given that their focus was on
‘‘advanced disease.’’ First, the definition of advanced is clear in
guidelines and is meant to incorporate PVT, performance status
1 or 2, or extrahepatic metastases (6). These trials loosened that
definition to include intermediate-stage (and even early-stage) pa￾tients, potentially diluting any effect 90Y radioembolization might
have over sorafenib. The studies should be interpreted as not
meeting their endpoint, and with the statistical design, one can
conclude that in those patients 90Y radioembolization was no bet￾ter and no worse than sorafenib. The studies were not powered for
noninferiority, and a declaration that they provide the same sur￾vival cannot be made. The studies may also have been limited by
the lack of modern dosimetry and boost techniques, currently
becoming standards of care in this patient population (33,34).
Although the analyses were appropriately by intention to treat,
this has the secondary effect of biasing in favor of sorafenib, since
many more patients are able to start therapy in pill form than those
who pass the lung shunt fraction study. Despite designs that fa￾vored sorafenib, the secondary endpoints (response, quality of life)
all favored 90Y radioembolization, factors that are relevant to
patients when considering treatment options. Also, although these
2 studies did not meet their endpoint, it does not mean there is no
clinical effect of 90Y radioembolization in this patient population.
Demonstrating the benefit of 90Y may require trial designs that are
more finely tuned, with more detailed and homogeneous inclusion
criteria. It would not be the first time an evolving treatment re￾quired several trials and different designs before a positive one
was illustrated; several of the early chemoembolization studies
were negative before the seminal studies establishing it as a standard
of care in intermediate HCC. The same approach may be required for 90Y radioembolization (35).
Unique strengths of this analysis include its being the largest
homogeneous patient cohort of PVT patients without the con￾founder of metastases and with long-term 10-y follow-up. These
data can be used to help design future studies. Limitations include
its being retrospective and lacking a control arm.
CONCLUSION
90Y radioembolization for HCC patients with PVT appears to
have an acceptable safety profile, with better survival in CP-A
patients than in CP-B patients. This study confirms prior reports
of survival in PVT patients treated with 90Y radioembolization,
and survival after 90Y radioembolization appears to exceed that in
similar patients treated with systemic therapies. Despite the neg￾ative studies recently reported, 90Y radioembolization is a reason￾able treatment option in properly selected PVT patients. Further
controlled studies are needed to compare it with systemic thera￾pies or other locoregional treatments for advanced-stage HCC.
