Abstract. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(BM-MSCs) have been shown to attenuate ischemia reperfu￾sion (IR) injury in the heart, brain and kidney. However, their 
exact roles in the liver remain to be defined. Our objective 
was to investigate the potential effects of BM-MSCs on a 
hepatic IR rat model during the first 24 h after reperfusion, a 
crucial period for hepatic IR damage formation. A rat model 
of normothermic partial hepatic ischemia was obtained by 
vascular clamping for 60 min. BM-MSCs were transplanted 
via portal vein injection. Injury severity, oxidative stress 
response and apoptosis of liver cells were assessed at 2, 6, 12 
and 24 h after reperfusion and cell transplantation was evalu￾ated. At 12 and 24 h after reperfusion, rats transplanted with 
BM-MSCs had significantly lower serum levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST), fewer damaged liver tissues, higher superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activi￾ties and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to rats 
in the sham transplantation group. At 24 h after reperfusion, 
IR rats transplanted with BM-MSCs had significantly fewer 
apoptotic hepatocytes, higher levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 
(Bcl-2) protein, and lower levels of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) 
and caspase-3 (Casp3) proteins compared to sham transplanta￾tion rats. In conclusion, BM-MSCs transplanted via the portal 
vein partially prevent hepatic IR injury by suppressing oxida￾tive stress and inhibiting apoptosis during the first 24 h after 
reperfusion.
Introduction
Due to the necessary clamping of the hepatic pedicle during 
resection of liver tumor or liver transplantation, hepatic isch￾emia/reperfusion (IR) injury occurs with the resumption of 
oxygen delivery to the liver, aggravating ischemia injury, and 
is considered the major cause for surgical failure (1). Reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production is increased in response to 
IR. Ischemia is characterized by ATP depletion and oxygen free 
radical production (2,3). Also, dysregulated electron transport 
chain in mitochondria may contribute to increased oxidative 
stress (4). However, the major source of ROS following reperfu￾sion has been shown to be the resident macrophages in the liver, or 
Kupffer cells (5,6). In an early phase (up to 6 h after reperfusion), 
Kupffer cells are activated, leading to increased ROS produc￾tion and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (7). In the late 
phase (6-24 h after reperfusion), recruitment of neutrophils and 
T-lymphocytes further increases the synthesis of ROS, signaling 
molecules and complement factors(8). Apoptosis is also increased 
in response to oxidative stress and inflammation (9). Therefore, 
ROS play a crucial role in the pathology of hepatic IR injury.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells. 
Similar to other stem cells, they can renew themselves and are 
capable of multipotent differentiation. MSCs are considered 
suitable for repairing damaged organs as they are non-immu￾nogenic and immunosuppressive cells able to differentiate 
into different lineages, and as they secrete a number of cyto￾kines (10). Preventing IR damage using MSCs has been shown 
in the brain (11), heart (12), and kidney (13). Previous studies 
showed that both MSCs and MSC-conditioned medium have 
the potential to improve the hepatic condition in rat models 
of liver fibrosis or acute hepatic failure (14). These studies 
indicate that the hepatoprotective effects of MSCs are mainly 
due to their paracrine function (15,16).
However, it remains unclear whether bone marrow-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) could also ameliorate 
hepatic damage induced by IR injury. Therefore, in the present 
study, we generated a rat model of hepatic IR injury that closely 
mimics clinical conditions. Using this model, we investigated 
the protective role of BM-MSCs and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms during the first 24 h after reperfusion.

Materials and methods
Animals and experimental design. Seventy-two male Wistar 
rats (weighing 230-250 g and aged 8-10weeks) were used for this 
study. Prior to the experiments, the rats were housed under stan￾dard conditions at the Animal Center of the Second Affiliated 
Hospital, Harbin Medical University. Experimental procedures 
used in this study were approved by the Administrative Panel 
on Laboratory Animal Care of Harbin Medical University.
Rats were randomly divided into three groups of 24 rats in 
each group. Rats in the sham-operated group were treated by 
laparotomy only; rats in the other two groups were subjected 
to IR. Upon reperfusion, the IR-transplanted group was 
immediately injected with BM-MSCs via the hepatic portal 
vein, while the IR-control group was injected with phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS) in the same manner. At 2, 6, 12 or 24 h 
after IR, 2 ml of blood was collected from the inferior vena 
cava of 6 rats from each group before the animals were eutha￾nized to harvest their livers.
Isolation of BM-MSCs. BM-MSCs were isolated using the 
density centrifugation method as previously described (17). 
Briefly, whole BM cells were flushed from the femurs and 
tibias of male 4-week old Wistar rats, and then fractionated 
in Lymphoprep™ density solution (density 1.077; Nycomed 
Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Following centrifugation at 800 x g 
for 20 min, the cells at the interface were collected and 
suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's 
F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12; Gibco-Invitrogen Inc., 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum 
(HyClone-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 
1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37˚C with 
95% humidity and 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours later, the culture 
medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells.
Labeling of BM-MSCs. To trace BM-MSCs following trans￾plantation, we labeled them with the fluorescent dye PKH26 
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), according to the manufac￾turer's instructions. Labeled cells were then cultured in growth 
medium for at least 24 h before transplantation.
Induction of hepatic IR injury and cell transplantation. Rats 
were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). A 
midline laparotomy was performed under aseptic conditions, 
the portal circulation to the left lateral and median lobes of the 
liver was carefully dissected, and a microaneurysm clamp was 
placed on the hepatic artery and portal vein to block the blood 
supply to these lobes. This treatment caused ischemia of 70% 
of the segmental liver and prevented mesenteric venous (18). 
The clamp was removed after 60 min and, immediately, 1x106
PKH26-labeled MSCs resuspended in 200 µl PBS or PBS 
alone were injected into the portal vein with a 30-gauge needle. 
Sham-operated rats received only the laparotomy. Surgery was 
closed with 4/0 silk suture. When fully awake, rats had free 
access to food and water. During the entire procedure, the core 
body temperature of each rat was continuously monitored with a 
rectal probe and maintained at 37.0±0.4˚C with a heating lamp.
Measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT). To estimate the degree 
of hepatic IR injury, we measured the levels of serum AST 
and ALT. Rats were anesthetized as described above, and 
2 ml of blood was collected from the inferior vena cava with 
a 20-gauge needle, placed in a microtainer tube with serum 
separator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and centrifuged at 
4,000 x g for 12 min. AST and ALT levels in the serum were 
measured using an automatic analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) 
and expressed as U/L.
Histological analysis. Livers were fixed in 10% buffered 
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 µm sections. 
Sections were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and 
observed with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, 
Japan) connected to a DXM1200F digital camera. The severity 
of the liver injury was assessed in accordance with the modi￾fied Suzuki classification (19), modified, by a pathologist who 
was blinded to the experimental design. Scores for severity 
were: none, 0; minimal, 1; moderate, 2; and severe, 3. For each 
rat, three liver sections were examined and three randomly 
selected high-power fields (x100) were analyzed in each 
section. The mean score for each animal was then determined 
by summation of all scores, divided by 9.
Assays for superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxi￾dase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in livers. A 
portion of the injured rat liver was harvested and homogenized 
in ice-cold 0.9% saline. Following centrifugation at 1,500 x g 
for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and used to measure 
the activity of SOD, GSH-Px and MDA using SOD, GSH-Px, 
or MDA detection kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Biotech, Nanjing, 
China), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions (20).
Detection of apoptotic cells in liver tissues. We used a terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end 
labeling (TUNEL) kit (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, 
Germany) to detect the apoptotic hepatocytes (21). Liver 
sections (5 µm) were stained and six sections were analyzed 
for each rat. Numbers of apoptotic cells and total hepatic 
cells in each section were counted in three randomly selected 
fields (x400). An apoptosis index (AI) was expressed as the 
mean percentage of apoptotic cells within the total number of 
hepatic cells for each animal.
Western blot analysis. Whole protein extracts were prepared 
from liver tissues. Freshly harvested liver tissues were 
homogenized in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) 
lysis buffer (Solarbio Shanghai, China) and centrifuged at 
12,000 x g for 15 min. The protein concentration in the super￾natant of each sample was measured with a DCTM Protein 
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated using a 
12% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to immunoblot 
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking 
in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 
at room temperature, membranes were serially incubated with 
the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-Actb, rabbit 
anti-B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), rabbit anti-Bcl-2-associated 
X protein (Bax), and rabbit anti-caspase-3 (Casp3) (1:200 dilu￾tion; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) 

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE 31: 1395-1401, 2013 1397
at 4˚C overnight. Membranes were then washed and incu￾bated with fluorescence-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit 
IgG (1:2,000 dilution; Invitrogen). The bound secondary 
antibodies were analyzed with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging 
System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA), normalized 
to β-actin.
Statistical analysis. SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) 
was used for statistical analyses. For multiple comparisons, 
data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Analysis between two groups was performed using the 
unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) where ANOVA indicated 
significance for the multiple comparisons. Data are reported as 
mean ± standard deviation. A P-value <0.05 was considered to 
indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Effect of transplanted BM-MSCs on ALT and AST serum 
levels. To determine the degree of IR-induced hepatic injury 
in the rat livers receiving BM-MSCs or PBS, we measured 
ALT and AST levels in sera collected at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h 
after IR induction and cell transplantation. Compared to the 
sham-operated rats, ALT and AST levels in IR model rats 
were higher at every time-point, with the greatest difference 
6 h after induction (Fig. 1). This suggests that IR injury was 
successfully induced in the IR model rats. At 12 and 24 h after 
reperfusion, ALT and AST levels in the IR-transplanted group 
significantly decreased compared to the IR-control group. This 
suggests that the transplantation of BM-MSCs had a protective 
effect against hepatic injury induced by the IR injury.
Transplanted BM-MSCs improve the histopathology of 
IR-induced livers. To further confirm the protective role of 
BM-MSCs in IR-induced hepatic injuries in rats, we examined 
the histopathology of livers harvested 2, 6, 12 or 24 h after 
IR induction and cell transplantation. At every time-point, all 
IR-induced livers showed sinusoidal congestion, cytoplasmic 
vacuolization, and focal necrosis, which are indicative of 
severe damage. When comparing the Suzuki scores between 
the livers of the IR-transplanted group and the IR-control 
group, improved histopathology and significantly lower 
Suzuki scores were found in the IR-transplanted group only at 
the 24 h time-point (Fig. 2).
Dynamic distribution of transplanted BM-MSCs in IR-induced 
livers. We therefore investigated the distribution pattern of 
BM-MSCs transplanted via the portal vein as a function of 
time. BM-MSCs were stained by PKH26 fluorescent dye 
in vitro. We observed that at 2 h, transplanted PKH26-labeled 
cells were clustered around the main branches of the portal 
triad; at 6 h, these cells had moved to the periportal area, 
and at 12 and 24 h they were scattered within the portal tract 
areas (Fig. 3).
Transplanted BM-MSCs attenuate the oxidative stress 
response in IR-induced livers. Previous studies have shown 
that the oxidative stress response is involved in IR-induced 
liver injury. We therefore assessed if transplanted BM-MSCs 
would attenuate the oxidative stress response in liver IR 
injury, by comparing SOD and GSH-Px activity levels, and 
MDA levels. We observed that SOD and GSH-Px levels were 
markedly decreased and that MDA levels markedly increased 
at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h in IR model rats compared with the sham￾operated rats. This suggests that oxidative stress was indeed 
involved in IR-induced liver injury. Furthermore, we observed 
that transplantation of BM-MSCs significantly increased SOD 
and GSH-Px levels and significantly decreased MDA levels at 
12 and 24 h, compared to rats in the IR-control group (Fig. 4). 
These results indicate that transplanted BM-MSCs attenuated 
the oxidative stress response in IR-induced liver injury.
Transplanted BM-MSCs inhibit apoptosis in IR-induced 
livers. Increased oxidative stress in a tissue often results in 
apoptosis. We therefore examined apoptotic activity in the 
IR-model rat livers and if the transplantation of BM-MSCs 
protected cells from apoptosis. We first assessed apoptotic 
cells in the livers using TUNEL staining, and then analyzed 
the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and 
the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Casp3. Twenty-four hours 
after reperfusion and cell transplantation, the livers from 
the IR-model rats had a markedly higher apoptotic index

than those from the sham-operated rats, suggesting that IR 
induction caused hepatic apoptosis (Fig. 5). This was further 
confirmed by a significant decrease in Bcl-2 levels, and by 
significant increases in Bax and Casp3 levels in IR-injured 
livers (Fig. 6). The apoptotic index was lower in livers from 
the IR-transplanted rats (Fig. 5), Bax and Casp3 levels were 
lower, and Bcl-2 levels were higher. Collectively, these results 
indicate that the transplanted BM-MSCs had a protective 
effect against apoptosis in the IR-induced livers.
Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the damage and molec￾ular mechanisms of liver IR injury in a rat model as well as 
the protective role of BM-MSCs during the crucial first 24-h 
period. We found evidence of IR injury during the first 24 h 
after reperfusion. From 2 h after reperfusion, AST and ALT 
serum levels were higher than in the sham-operated rats and 
severe damage was observed in the histopathology. In addition,

evidence of increased oxidative response was observed from 
2 h after reperfusion, while apparent apoptosis was observed 
at 24 h. We also observed that BM-MSCs transplanted via 
the portal vein exerted a protective effect against hepatic IR 
damage during the late phase following reperfusion. This 
observation was further supported by the dynamic distribution 
of BM-MSCs; 24 h after reperfusion, the majority of the cells 
were scattered in the portal tract area of the livers.
For a therapeutic use of stem cells to be efficient, cells 
must be easy to isolate, available in large amounts, able to 
expand in vitro, and able to survive in vivo in sometimes 
harsh conditions. Based on these criteria, BM-MSCs are suit￾able candidates (22). Once injected, they are recruited at the 
site of injury via homing mechanisms involving the CXCR4 
receptor and the stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) (23). Once 
implanted, stem cells improve the injured tissue by secreting 
growth factors [including vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1)] (24,25), by differentiating into organ 
cells, by transdifferentiating the organ cells and by inducing

neovascularization (11-13). Results from the present study 
are in agreement with results obtained from studies of other 
organs, such as the heart (12), brain (11) and kidney (13). 
Our results show that BM-MSCs homed to IR-injured liver 
tissue and improved liver conditions, as assessed by apoptosis 
measurement. Also, the protective role of BM-MSCs was 
observed during the late phase of the crucial period (from 12 
to 24 h after reperfusion) of IR damage induction, indicating 
that BM-MSCs were viable and able to function in a short 
time after transplantation. Differentiating into hepatocytes or 
hepatocyte-like cells requires time; therefore, it is more likely 
that the short-term effects of transplanted BM-MSCs on IR 
injury were achieved via a paracrine mechanism, rather than 
via repopulation.
The oxidative stress response has long been recognized 
as central to the pathogenesis of hepatic IR injury (26). In 
the present study, we observed that at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after 
reperfusion, the levels of the antioxidative enzymes SOD and 
GSH-Px were significantly decreased, while MDA levels, 
a marker for oxidative activity, was significantly increased, 
compared with the sham-operated control rats. Therefore, our 
observations are consistent with other studies showing that 
the oxidative stress response is involved in the formation of 
hepatic IR injury in the first 24 h.
We demonstrated in the present study that BM-MSCs 
transplanted via the portal vein attenuated the oxidative 
stress response in IR-injured livers. The suppressive role of 
BM-MSCs in the oxidative stress response was also observed 
in other studies of drug-induced animal models of liver 
disease. In a mouse model of liver cirrhosis induced by carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4), transplantation of human BM-MSCs 
suppressed the oxidative stress response and improved liver 
conditions (27). In a rat model of hepatic injury induced by 
CCl4, administration of BM-MSCs induced a cytoprotective 
response by an antioxidative process (28). MSC suppression 
of the oxidative stress response was also shown in rats with 
IR-induced lung and kidney injury (29). Our study showed 
that at 12 and 24 h after reperfusion, the BM-MSC transplants 
attenuated the decrease in SOD and GSH-Px, and the increase 
in MDA, that otherwise occurred in the IR-control rats that 
received PBS only. These results indicate that BM-MSCs are 
capable of reducing the oxidative stress response in livers 
subjected to IR injury.
Apoptosis plays an important role in IR-injured liver 
and is triggered either by the mitochondria or by tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. Indeed, hypoxia leads to 
reduced ATP production and ATP-dependent cellular events 
are stopped (30). Mitochondria also regulate apoptosis by 
caspase activation (31). Hypoxia-induced injury also induces 
an immune response resulting in the secretion of cytokines 
(including TNF, SDF-1 and interleukins) and the attraction of 
a number of cells, including MSCs. TNF signaling activates 
caspases, resulting in apoptosis (32). During reperfusion, 
immune and endothelial cells are activated and produce 
ROS, which directly damage nearby cells and activate Ras, 
increasing apoptosis (33). In a mouse model of IR-induced 
hepatic injury, administrating the antioxidant mangafodipir 
reestablished oxidative balance and suppressed apoptosis (34). 
Using the same mouse model, Yu et al (35) demonstrated that 
the Notch-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and acti￾vator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway protected 
hepatocytes from IR injury by attenuating oxidative stress and 
inhibiting apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, 
we observed apoptosis in liver tissues subjected to IR 24 h 
after reperfusion, as shown by an increased apoptotic index, 
decreased expression of Bcl-2, and increased expression of Bax 
and Casp3. Furthermore, we showed that transplantation of 
BM-MSCs via the portal vein decreased apoptosis. Therefore, 
our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that 
apoptosis is involved in IR-induced hepatic injury and that 
BM-MSCs inhibit apoptosis.
BM-MSCs inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis by secreting cyto￾kines, thus regulating cellular signal transduction pathways. In 
rats, BM-MSCs secrete VEGF, which attenuates myocardial 
IR injury by activating the PI3K signaling pathway (36), and 
the PI3K pathway can regulate the expression of Bcl-2, an anti￾apoptotic protein (37). In rat neurons, MSCs secrete cytokines 
that reduce chronic ethanol-induced injury by modulating the 
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway (38). 
The ERK1/2 pathway regulates apoptosis by increasing the

Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, Casp3 levels and TNF levels (39). In the 
present study, we observed, at 24 h after reperfusion and 
BM-MSC transplantation, that Bcl-2 levels, an anti-apoptotic 
protein, was increased, and that the expression levels of 
pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Casp3, were decreased. We 
thus inferred that BM-MSCs inhibit apoptosis in IR-induced 
hepatic injury via their paracrine activity.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that in a rat model of IR 
injury, hepatic injury occurred within 24 h of reperfusion and 
that the oxidative stress response and subsequent apoptosis 
were involved in the process of hepatic IR damage. We also 
observed that BM-MSCs transplanted via the portal vein could 
attenuate IR injury by, at least in part, suppressing the oxida￾tive stress response and inhibiting apoptosis.
