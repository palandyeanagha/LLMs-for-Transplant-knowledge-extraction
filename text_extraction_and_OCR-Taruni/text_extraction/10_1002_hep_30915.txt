BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with liver disease 
acquire complex changes in their hemostatic system, which 
results in a fragile rebalanced status. The status of the fi￾brinolytic system is controversial, as is the role of fibrinolytic 
dysfunction in bleeding and thrombosis in patients with cir￾rhosis. Here, we aimed to determine fibrinolytic status and its 
relationship with outcome in acutely ill patients with cirrhosis.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We assessed plasma fibrino￾lytic potential in a large cohort of patients with acutely de￾compensated cirrhosis (AD, n  =  52) or acute-on-chronic liver 
failure (ACLF, n  =  57). Compared with 40 healthy volun￾teers, median clot lysis times (CLTs) were shorter in patients 
with AD but comparable to controls in patients with ACLF. 
However, the variability in CLTs in patients was much larger 
than in healthy controls, and in both patient groups, a pro￾portion of patients had clearly prolonged or shortened CLTs. 
The variability in CLTs in patients was not readily explained 
by variations in plasma levels of key fibrinolytic proteins. 
However, CLTs were clearly related to clinical characteristics, 
with longer CLTs in patients with sepsis and patients with 
any organ failure (as defined by the European Foundation 
for the Study of Chronic Liver Disease organ failure scores). 
CLTs were not different between patients that did or did not 
experience bleeding or a thrombotic event during follow-up. 
Baseline CLTs were substantially longer in patients that died 
within 30  days of admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a mixed fibrino￾lytic phenotype in acutely ill patients with cirrhosis with base￾line hypofibrinolysis associated with sepsis, organ failure, and 
short-term mortality. These associations may be explained by 
defective clearance of intraorgan microthrombi that have been 
proposed to drive organ failure. (Hepatology 2019;0:1-10).
Patients with cirrhosis frequently have complex 
changes in their hemostatic system. The net 
effect of these changes is a hemostatic system 
that is in a “rebalanced” status,(1) although notable 
hyper- and hypocoagulable features may be pres￾ent.(2-4) Although there is increasing consensus that 
a decreased platelet count in patients with cirrhosis

is (in part) balanced by highly elevated plasma levels 
of von Willebrand factor(5) and that the thrombin￾generating capacity is normal to increased compared 
with healthy individuals,(6,7) there is continuing con￾troversy on the status of the fibrinolytic system.(8)
Using various approaches, it has been demonstrated 
that some patients with cirrhosis are in a hyperfibri￾nolytic state, which is ascribed to complex changes in 
plasma levels of fibrinolytic proteins, with an import￾ant role for elevated levels of tissue-type plasmin￾ogen activator (tPA).(9-11) However, it has also been 
argued that the fibrinolytic system is in balance in 
these patients because of the concomitant decrease 
of antifibrinolytics (antiplasmin, thrombin activatable 
fibrinolysis inhibitor [TAFI]) and the profibrinolytic 
plasminogen.(12) However, this fibrinolytic balance may 
be easily disturbed, and whether the balance remains 
intact in patients with severe disease is questionable.
Patients with acute decompensation of cirrho￾sis (AD) or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) 
have progressive changes in their hemostatic sys￾tem(2,13,14) and are at particular risk for bleeding and 
thrombotic complications.(15) Patients with ACLF 
are characterized by development of organ failure 
and high short-term mortality.(16-18) An intense 
systemic inflammatory response that is often com￾plicated (or precipitated) by infection is one of the 
hallmarks of ACLF.(19) Despite recent advances in 
supportive care, ACLF remains associated with high 
mortality and resource use, including blood and 
blood products.(20)
We have studied fibrinolytic status in patients with 
AD and ACLF and showed that although plasma 
fibrinolytic potential was similar in patients with AD 
and ACLF compared with healthy controls, individ￾ual patients showed accelerated as well as inhibited 
clot lysis.(2) We have also demonstrated that patients 
with ACLF had decreased lysis of whole blood clots, 
assessed by thromboelastometry, in comparison with 
patients with AD, 72  hours after hospital admis￾sion.(14) Interestingly, it has been well established that 
patients with sepsis and patients with acute liver fail￾ure, both of which are inflammatory syndromes that 
are frequently complicated by multiple organ failure, 
frequently have inhibited fibrinolysis,(21,22) which may 
contribute to organ failure by intraorgan thrombotic 
events.(23,24) The role of sepsis and multiorgan failure 
on the fibrinolytic status of acutely ill patients with 
cirrhosis has not yet been established.
With the aim to provide a better clinical approach 
to hemostasis management of acutely ill patients with 
cirrhosis, we sought to describe the fibrinolytic profile 
in a large cohort of patients from two expert clinical 
centers. In addition, we assessed laboratory and clini￾cal determinants of the fibrinolytic status with partic￾ular emphasis on sepsis and multiorgan failure.
Patients and Methods
Between February 2018 and September 2018, adult 
patients with AD (n = 52) or ACLF (n = 58) consec￾utively admitted to King’s College Hospital London

Hospital Clínic Barcelona (2017/0948) approved the 
study protocol, which was in accordance with the 
Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Informed consent or 
assent was obtained from participants or their personal 
consultees. Exclusion criteria for this study were acute 
liver failure, known congenital coagulation disorders, 
the use of anticoagulants or platelet function inhibitors, 
pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus positivity, 
extrahepatic malignancy, and hepatocellular carci￾noma outside the Milan criteria. A Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
diagram outlining details of patient inclusion is given 
in Supporting Fig. S1. Cirrhosis was defined by the 
presence of two or more of i) histological evidence of 
cirrhosis on liver biopsy, ii) laboratory abnormalities 
consistent with cirrhosis, or iii) radiological findings 
consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. AD 
of chronic liver disease and ACLF were defined and 
graded according to the number of organ failures in 
concordance with criteria reported in the CANONIC 
study.(16) Patients were followed up with until 30 days 
after discharge, death, or transplant, whatever hap￾pened first. Healthy controls aged >18 years (n = 40) 
were enrolled at King’s College Hospital (n = 20) and 
Hospital Clínic Barcelona (n = 20) to establish refer￾ence values for the various laboratory tests performed. 
Healthy controls provided informed consent with the 
protocol approved by the NRES Committee London, 
Westminster (12/LO/1417) and the Medical Ethical 
Committee Hospital Clínic Barcelona (2017/0948). 
Exclusion criteria for healthy controls were body 
mass index below 18 or above 28, pregnancy or active 
breastfeeding, a personal history of thrombotic or liver 
disease, untreated medical conditions, chronic medical 
conditions requiring regular primary or secondary care 
review, or current use of anticoagulants, platelet func￾tion inhibitors, or oral contraceptives.
DATA COLLECTION
We collected baseline data on patient demographics, 
comorbidities, biochemistry, and illness severity scores. 
The severity of liver disease was evaluated with Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), CLIF-AD, CLIF￾ACLF, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), 
and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores. Sepsis syndrome was 
defined according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines. Data on 
hemorrhagic or thrombotic events and on transfusion 
requirements were collected throughout hospitalization. 
Bleeding events were defined according to the follow￾ing criteria: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a 
critical area or organ, and/or bleeding causing a fall in 
hemoglobin level of ≥2 g/L or leading to transfusion ≥2 
units of packed red cells.
BLOOD SAMPLES
Blood samples were collected in sodium citrate￾containing vacutainer tubes (0.129 M) from an arte￾rial line, from a central venous catheter, or by standard 
peripheral venous phlebotomy within the first 2 days 
of admission or after the development of ACLF. 
Samples were obtained before the administration 
of blood products, anticoagulants, or platelet func￾tion inhibitors. Within 2 hours after the blood draw, 
the sample was centrifuged at 2,000g and 10,000g
for 10  minutes at ambient temperature. Plasma was 
stored at −80°C until it was used for analyses.
CLOT LYSIS ASSAY
Lysis of a tissue factor–induced clot by exoge￾nous tPA was studied by monitoring changes in tur￾bidity during clot formation and subsequent lysis as 
described.(25) In short, 50  μL plasma was pipetted 
in a 96-well microtiter plate. Subsequently, 50  μL 
of a mixture containing phospholipid vesicles (40% 
l-α-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 20% l-α-dioleoyl￾phosphatidylserine, and 40% l-α-dioleoylphospha￾tidylethanolamine, final concentration 10  μM), tPA 
(final concentration 56 ng/mL), tissue factor (Innovin 
[Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany] 
final dilution 1:1,000), and CaCl2 (final concentration 
17  mM), diluted in N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine￾N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (25  mM 
HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 
0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), was added 
using a multichannel pipette. After thorough mix￾ing, the plate was incubated at 37°C in a Spectramax 
340 kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, 
San Jose, CA, USA), and the optical density at 
340 nm was monitored every 20 seconds, resulting in 
a clot lysis turbidity profile. The clot lysis time (CLT) 
was derived from this clot lysis profile and defined as 
the time (minutes) from the midpoint of the clear to 
maximum turbid transition, representing clot forma￾tion, to the midpoint of the maximum turbid to clear 
transition, representing the lysis of the clot.

PLASMA PROTEIN LEVELS
Plasminogen levels were measured on an auto￾mated coagulation analyzer (ACL TOP 300) with 
reagents and protocols from the manufacturer 
(Werfen, Breda, the Netherlands). Plasma lev￾els of tPA, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 
(PAI-1), and TAFI were determined using com￾mercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays: Zymutest tPA (Hyphen Biomed, Neuville￾sur-Oise, France), PAI-1 DuoSet (R&D systems, 
Minneapolis, MN), and Zymutest Activatable TAFI 
(Hyphen Biomed).
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
Statistics, version 23 (IBM, Inc., Chicago, IL) and 
GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Data were pre￾sented as means with standard deviation or medians 
and interquartile ranges for continuous variables as 
appropriate and as percentages for categorical variables. 
Means of two groups were compared by Student t test 
or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Multiple 
groups were compared using one-way analysis of vari￾ance (with the Bonferroni posttest) or Kruskal-Wallis 
H test (with Dunn’s posttest) as appropriate. Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation 
between variables. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and their corresponding areas under 
the curve (AUC) were used to assess the performance 
of the MELD, SOFA, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score 
relative to the CLT in predicting outcome. Logistic 
regression models were used to assess the relation of 
CLT to outcome with adjustment for MELD, SOFA, 
or Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. P value  <  0.05 was 
considered significant.

PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS
We have determined CLTs and plasma levels of tPA, 
PAI-1, plasminogen, and TAFI in 52 adult patients 
with AD cirrhosis and 57 adult patients with ACLF 
and compared these levels with plasma concentrations 
in 40 healthy controls. Patient demographics and 
clinical and laboratory data are presented in Table 1. 
Healthy controls were younger than patients (35 [28-
43] years, and 45% were male). Among patients with

PLASMA FIBRINOLYTIC PROFILE
IN PATIENTS WITH AD AND ACLF
We studied plasma fibrinolytic potential in patients 
with AD and ACLF. CLT was significantly shorter 
in the AD cohort compared with the healthy controls 
and was similar between the ACLF cohort and healthy 
controls. CLT was significantly prolonged in the 
ACLF cohort compared with the AD cohort (Fig. 1). 
However, a large variability was observed in the CLT 
values, with a substantial proportion of patients that 
had CLTs shorter than the reference values of the 
healthy controls and a substantial proportion that had 
substantially prolonged CLTs. The spread in CLT val￾ues was particularly profound in patients with ACLF 
with some patients with very rapid clot lysis and some 
patients that showed no lysis at all during the time 
span of the experiment. CLTs were similar between 
patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 but were substan￾tially elevated in those with ACLF grade 3 (ACLF-1 
66  minutes [57-82]; ACLF-2 60  minutes [30-86]; 
ACLF-3 180 minutes [60-180]).
Plasma levels of PAI-1, plasminogen, and TAFI 
are important determinants of CLT in healthy indi￾viduals.(26) Fig. 2 shows levels of these analytes in 
our cohort. Plasma levels of PAI-1 were substan￾tially higher in patients compared with controls, but 
levels were comparable between patients with AD and 
ACLF. Plasminogen and TAFI levels were substan￾tially lower in patients, with significantly lower levels 
in patients with ACLF compared with patients with 
AD. Within the ACLF cohort, there was a stepwise 
decrease in plasminogen and TAFI levels with increas￾ing ACLF grade (ACLF-1 36% [27-56], ACLF-2 
34% [21-43], ACLF-3 18% [15-22] for plasmino￾gen, ACLF-1 58% [31-77], ACLF-2 38% [21-56], 
ACLF-3 30% [17-47] for TAFI).
Although tPA is not a determinant of CLT in 
healthy individuals, as exogenous tPA is added to 
the test reagent mixture, excessive tPA levels, as for 
example encountered during liver transplantation, 
appear to drive fibrinolysis in the assay. We therefore 
assessed tPA antigen levels, which reflect both free 
tPA and tPA-PAI-1 complexes, and found substan￾tially increased levels in patients compared with con￾trols, with no differences between patients with AD 
and ACLF.
In linear regression analyses, we found that plasma 
levels of plasminogen, TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 weakly 
correlated with CLTs, but only tPA levels showed cor￾relations both in all patients combined and in AD and 
ACLF patients analyzed as separate cohorts (Table 2).
CLINICAL DETERMINANTS OF 
CLT
As plasma levels of fibrinolytic proteins did not 
appear to explain why some patients were clearly 
hypofibrinolytic and others clearly hyperfibrinolytic, 
we assessed clinical features in relation to CLT. In all 
patients combined, CLT was significantly longer in 
patients with sepsis at the time of sampling compared 
with patients without sepsis (Fig. 3). In line with this, 
patients with sepsis had higher PAI-1 (3.9  ng/mL 
[1.6-9.6] vs. 1.7 ng/mL [0.8-3.8], P < 0.01) and lower 
plasminogen (29% [18-41] vs. 42% [31-56], P < 0.01) 
and TAFI (39% [21-62] vs. 51% [35-78] P  =  0.03) 
plasma levels compared with patients without sepsis. 
tPA levels were comparable between patients who 
were septic and patients who were nonseptic.
Because hypofibrinolysis has been proposed to 
contribute to organ failure in acutely ill patients by 
microvascular occlusion, we have explored the relation 
between fibrinolysis and the severity of organ failure. 
CLTs were higher in patients with SOFA scores above

the median, and CLT were slightly higher in patients 
with CLIF-AD and CLIF-ACLF scores above the 
median (Table 3). In addition, when patients were 
stratified according to absence or presence of individ￾ual organ failure, CLTs were higher in patients with 
all individual organ failures, although the difference in

CLT in patients with or without coagulation failure 
did not reach statistical significance. CLTs were sim￾ilar when patients were stratified according to ascites 
severity (no ascites 54 min [36-72], minimal ascites 
57 min [44-77], moderate ascites 61 min [43-82], 
severe ascites 57 min [32-94]).
CLT IN RELATION TO CLINICAL
EVENTS AND OUTCOME
In all patients combined, 35 (24%) experienced a 
bleeding event during hospitalization (8 patients in the 
AD group and 27 patients in the ACLF group), and 
more than half (63%) of these events were related to 
portal hypertension (Table 4). Six thrombotic events 
were observed during hospitalization: 4 patients had a 
de novo portal vein thrombosis, 1 patient experienced 
thrombosis of a previously placed transjugular intra￾hepatic portosystemic shunt, and 1 patient had deep 
venous thrombosis.
CLTs were similar in those patients who bled com￾pared with those who did not, 54  minutes (42-83) 
versus 61 minutes (41-78), P = 0.7, and there were no 
differences in CLT between patients with bleeding 
related to portal hypertension or bleeding from other 
causes, 59 minutes (41-78) versus 56 minutes (44-95), 
P = 0.5. CLTs were similar in patients who had throm￾botic complications compared with those who did not, 
66 minutes (49-105) versus 57 minutes (41-78), P = 0.4.
Seventeen patients (15 ACLF and 2 AD) died 
within 30  days after hospital admission. Patients 
who died had significantly longer CLTs compared 
with survivors, 101 minutes (57-180) versus 57 min￾utes (40-72), P < 0.001 (Fig. 4). In logistic regression 
analyses, CLT remained longer in those who died 
compared with survivors when adjusted for Child￾Turcotte-Pugh (P  =  0.002) or MELD (P  =  0.004) 
score. However, when CLT was adjusted for SOFA 
score, the difference between those who died and

Discussion
In the present study, we found a mixed fibrinolytic 
profile of acutely ill patients with cirrhosis, with some 
patients who were evidently hyperfibrinolytic and 
some patients with profound hypofibrinolysis. Plasma 
levels of individual fibrinolytic proteins did not clearly 
identify those patients with hypofibrinolysis or hyper￾fibrinolysis, but the presence of sepsis and organ 
failure was clearly associated with hypofibrinolysis. 
Finally, we found marked baseline hypofibrinolysis in 
patients that died within 30 days of admission, which 
appeared independent of severity of liver disease.
We have studied plasma fibrinolytic potential using 
an assay that is associated with risk of venous and arte￾rial thrombosis in the general population,(27) and it is 
tempting to speculate that those patients with cirrhosis 
that are hypofibrinolytic using this test are at risk for 
thrombotic complications as well. These thrombotic 
events not only encompass deep vein thrombosis but 
possibly also portal vein thrombosis and intraorgan 
microthrombosis. Such microthrombi could contrib￾ute to hepatic and extrahepatic organ failure and could 
explain the relation between hypofibrinolysis and short￾term mortality in patients with AD and ACLF. Indeed, 
intraorgan microthrombosis is thought to contribute 
to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in patients 
with sepsis without an underlying liver disease, and 
a hypofibrinolytic state is linked to intraorgan micro￾thrombosis in these patients.(28,29) There is continuing 
interest in the use of anticoagulant agents, including 
heparin, antithrombin concentrate, tissue factor path￾way inhibitor, activated protein C, and recombinant 
thrombomodulin in the treatment of sepsis,(30,31) and 
all these agents are thought to be beneficial at least in 
part by reduction of intraorgan thrombosis. Although 
it is conceivable that such agents might benefit patients 
with ACLF as well, the use of anticoagulant agents is 
complicated by the extensive hemostatic changes in 
these patients.(2,13,14) On the other hand, patients with 
sepsis without underlying liver disease may also have 
profound hemostatic changes, and it is incompletely 
defined what proportion of hemostatic changes in 
patients with ACLF is related to their underlying liver 
disease relative to the hemostatic changes induced by 
excessive inflammation and sepsis.
Our study cohort, and particularly those patients 
with ACLF, showed large variability in CLTs, which 
makes the fibrinolytic status of patients with ACLF 
hardly predictable at an individual level. The hetero￾geneity underlying AD and ACLF could partially 
explain this finding. The trigger for decompensation, 
etiology of the liver disease, extent of liver dysfunc￾tion, and involvement of extrahepatic organ failure 
vary widely between patients and may affect the fibri￾nolytic status. In addition, the concurrence of sepsis, 
which frequently complicates the clinical course of 
patients with ACLF, may also contribute to the vari￾ability in fibrinolytic status.(32) The inflammation￾induced impairment of fibrinolysis is a well-established 
consequence of sepsis and is among other factors 
related to the excessive release of PAI-1 by endothe￾lial cells, which is at least partly related to production 
of TNFα.
(29,33,34) Indeed, in our cohort, PAI-1 levels 
and CLTs were significantly higher in patients with 
sepsis compared with those patients without sepsis. As

the inflammation-induced impairment of fibrinolysis 
plays a pivotal role in multiple organ dysfunction by 
promoting microvascular fibrin deposition in sepsis￾associated disseminated intravascular coagulation in 
patients without underlying liver disease,(28) it seems 
plausible that a similar mechanism acts in patients with 
ACLF. Indeed, the functional characteristics of organ 
failure associated with sepsis in patients without under￾lying liver disease are very close to the sequence of 
events leading to ACLF in cirrhosis. For example, the 
severity of systemic inflammation in ACLF is similar 
to that of patients with sepsis.(35) Interestingly, fibrino￾lytic capacity did not differ between patients stratified 
according to ascites severity, although ascites is an estab￾lished source of fibrinolytic activity.(36) Indeed, D-dimer 
levels, which were reported in our cohort(37) and reflect 
in vivo fibrinolytic activity, progressively increased with 
increasing severity of ascites (data not shown). Even 
though the presence of ascites does not appear to alter 
plasma fibrinolytic potential, it may be that patients 
with ascites do have altered local fibrinolytic activity, 
and this possibility requires additional study.
Our present data are in line with another study 
from our group that showed increased short-term 
mortality in those critically ill patients with cirrhosis 
with a relative hypofibrinolytic status as assessed by 
thromboelastometry at 72  hours after admission.(14)
Given the large variability in the fibrinolytic status in 
AD and ACLF and its potential significance, it would 
be useful to have a diagnostic global fibrinolytic test 
as predictor of outcome and possibly to guide prohe￾mostatic and antifibrinolytic therapy in these patients. 
Although thromboelastometry is widely available for 
clinical use, it is limited by the low sensitivity com￾pared with the global tests of fibrinolysis performed in 
a research setting (such as the CLT). Efforts to bring 
such tests into clinical practice would be desired, for 
example, by adapting the test for use on automated 
coagulation analyzers used in the diagnostic labora￾tory. It has to be noted, however, that AD and ACLF 
are very dynamic syndromes, and it is not unlikely 
that fibrinolytic potential changes substantially over 
time. Theoretically, patients may shift from a very 
hyperfibrinolytic to a very hypofibrinolytic phenotype, 
for example, when sepsis develops during the course 
of their decompensating event. Future studies are 
required to study the dynamics of fibrinolytic potential 
over time and its consequences for the use of fibrino￾lytic capacity in clinical management and prediction.
In summary, our study demonstrates a mixed fibrino￾lytic phenotype in acutely ill patients with cirrhosis with 
hypofibrinolysis associated with sepsis, organ failure, 
and short-term mortality. Efforts to implement sensi￾tive fibrinolytic assays into clinical practice will assist 
in personalized management of fibrinolytic dysfunction 
and will aid outcome prediction of these patients.
