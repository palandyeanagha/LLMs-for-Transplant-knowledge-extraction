Prostacyclin in the Treatment of Protamine-Mediated Right Ventricular Failure and Acute 
Pulmonary Hypertension. Tohoku J. Exp. Med., 2005, 207 (1), 51-58 ── Protamine is 
used after cardiopulmonary bypass was stopped in order to reverse the anticoagulant ef￾fects of heparin administered during open-heart operations. Adverse hemodynamic re￾sponses to protamine are common, ranging from minor perturbations to cardiovascular 
collapse. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a prostacyclin is effec￾tive in the treatment of protamine-mediated acute pulmonary hypertension and right ven￾tricular failure in the perioperative period of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) operations. In sixty-eight (1.78%) of 3800 patients who underwent isolated 
CABG, acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure developed during or 
following the protamine infusion. These 68 patients were included in the study and were 
randomized into two groups. Thirty-eight of the patients received prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), 
norepinephrine and dopamine (PGI2 group), whereas 30 patients received nitroglycerin, 
norepinephrine and dopamine (control group). Hemodynamic data were recorded before 
and after the above drug combinations. The mean value of left ventricle ejection fraction 
significantly increased (p < 0.05) and mean values of central venous pressure, pulmonary 
artery systolic and diastolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary 
vascular resistance significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the PGI2 group. The mean value 
of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased (p < 0.05) and the mean 
value of central venous pressure significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the control group. In 
conclusion, prostacyclin (PGI2) is effective in the treatment of protamine-mediated acute 
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure in the perioperative period in isolated 
CABG operations. This finding may be an important contribution to the treatment of se￾vere protamine complications during open-heart operations. ──── prostacyclin; prot￾amine; heparin; pulmonary hypertension; right ventricular failure

Protamine sulfate is a polycationic peptide 
that is used in order to reverse the anticoagulant 
effects of heparin (Viaro et al. 2002). In open￾heart surgery, protamine is used after cardiopul￾monary bypass (CPB) was stopped. However, the 
side effects of protamine show a wide spectrum 
ranging from minimal cardiovascular deteriora￾tion to grave cardiovascular collapse which can 
threaten the life of the patient (Stewart et al. 1984; 
Levy et al. 1986, 1989; Pearson et al. 1992). 
Acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricu￾lar dysfunction, for instance, can occur as devas￾tating complications of protamine infusion.
Once these complications develop, immedi￾ate abortion of intravenous infusion of protamine, 
readministration of heparin and the recommence￾ment of CPB are the safe and most-applied initial 
therapeutics. However, there is yet insufficient 
literature to define therapeutic agents for further 
treatment.
The purpose of the current study was to in￾vestigate the efficiency of prostacyclin in the 
treatment of protamine-mediated right ventricular 
failure and acute pulmonary hypertension in the 
perioperative period of isolated coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) operations.
METHODS
Subjects. Between January 1991 and December 
2004, 3,800 consecutive patients underwent isolated 
CABG operations in three hospitals in Turkey. In 68 
(1.78%) of 3,800 patients, acute pulmonary hypertension 
and right ventricular failure developed during or follow￾ing the protamine infusion intraoperatively. The patients, 
in whom protamine reactions occured, were included in 
the study. They were 37 (54%) men and 31 women 
(46%), and the mean age of the patients was 53 ± 3.1. 
Coronary arteriography was performed for the diagnosis 
of the coronary artery disease during cardiac catheteriza￾tion in all patients in the preoperative period. 
Angiographic evaluation of the left subclavian artery and 
left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was done to elimi￾nate any atherosclerotic lesion in the subclavian artery, 
which may cause subclavian steal syndrome (Cınar et al. 
2004). The use of aspirin had been ceased in all patients 
one week prior to the operation. Inclusion criteria of the 
study were intraoperative development of pulmonary hy￾pertension and right ventricular failure during or follow￾ing intravenous infusion of protamine. Patients with 
heart valve disease and prior diagnosed pulmonary hy￾pertension were excluded from the study. Table 1 pres￾ents the characteristics of the patients in the preoperative 
period. This research was conducted with approval of 
the ethic committee of the School of Medicine, Suleyman

Operative technique. Standard anesthetic tech￾niques and anesthetics were used in all patients. A Swan￾Ganz catheter was inserted through the right internal jug￾ular vein after anesthesia induction for hemodynamic 
measurements. Following a standard median sternotomy, 
the ascending aorta was cannulated for arterial inflow 
and the right atrial appendage was cannulated with two￾stage cannula for venous uptake. A cardioplegic tack 
was introduced into the aortic root proximal to the aortic 
cannulation site for antegrade cardioplegic delivery. A 
purse-string suture was passed in the right atrium, and 
the retrograde cannula was placed into the coronary sinus 
for retrograde cardioplegic delivery. Heparin was given 
at a dose of 3 mg/kg for systemic anticoagulation effect 
and CPB was established. Myocardial protection was 
maintained using initially cold (0-4°C) crystalloid car￾dioplegia solution followed by cold blood (10°C) cardio￾plegia and finally warm blood (37°C) cardioplegia as de￾scribed in “Integrated Cardioplegia Protocol.” Mild 
systemic hypothermia (32°C) was applied. The left in￾ternal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the 
left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and sa￾phenous venous grafts were used for bypass to the other 
coronary arteries. Both single-clamp and side-clamp 
techniques were used for construction of proximal anas￾tomoses. After cessation of CPB, removing the venous 
cannulas and confirmation that hemorrhage was not se￾vere, the heparin was reversed through the use of intrave￾nous protamine, in a ratio of 1.5 mg of protamine to 1 
mg of circulating heparin.
Treatment of protamine adverse reactions. Pulmo￾nary hypertension was defined as follows: > 40 mmHg 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure, > 20 mmHg pulmo￾nary artery diastolic pressure, > 20 mmHg pulmonary ar￾tery wedge pressure and > 250 (dyn × sec) / cm5
 pulmo￾nary vascular resistance. Right ventricular failure was 
described on inspection as determination of diminished 
right ventricular contractions with unaffected left ven￾tricular contractions. When pulmonary hypertension and 
right ventricular dysfunction developed, intravenous in￾fusion of protamine was immediately aborted. Heparin 
was given at a dose to ensure an activated clotting time 
(ACT) of more than 450 seconds and CPB was restarted 
in necessitating patients. When right ventricular disten￾sion was noted, 200-250 ml of blood was drained back to 
the heart-lung machine to decrease over-volume. In ad￾dition to these measures, patients were randomized into 
two groups, who were treated with two different treat￾ment schemes. One group (n = 38) received intravenous 
(IV) injection of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) (Flolan®, 
GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) (2 ng/kg/min), nor￾epinephrine (4 μg/kg/min) and dopamine (2.8 μg/kg/
min). The control group (n = 30) received IV injection 
of nitroglycerin (5 μg/kg/min), norepinephrine (4 μg/kg/
min) and dopamine (2.8 μg/kg/min). These drugs were 
administered directly into the pulmonary artery via distal 
lumen of the Swan-Ganz catheter. Rapid administration 
of protamine was avoided and corticosteroids were used 
to avoid recurrence of protamine reactions after termina￾tion of secondary CPB.
Hemodynamic data. Systolic systemic arterial pres￾sure (SSAP) (mmHg), diastolic systemic arterial pressure 
(DSAP) (mmHg), heart rate (HR) (per minute), cardiac 
output (CO) (L/min), cardiac index (CI) (L/min/
m²), pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures 
(PASP) and (PADP) (mmHg), pulmonary artery capillary 
wedge pressure (PCWP) (mmHg), left ventricle ejection 
fraction (EF) (%), central venous pressure (CVP) 
(mmHg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ([dyn 
× sec]/cm5
) were recorded in all patients. PVR was cal￾culated using the following formula:
 PVR = 80 × (MPAP-PCWP) / CO
(PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance; MPAP, mean 
pulmonary artery pressure; PCWP, pulmonary artery 
wedge pressure; CO, cardiac output).
All measurements except EF were done through the 
Swan-Ganz catheter. EF was measured by transthoracic 
echocardiography in the preoperative period and by 
transesophageal echocardiography in the operating the￾ater. In order to define severity of protamine reactions, 
hemodynamic data were recorded just after CPB had 
stopped (time 1 = t1) and at the time protamine reactions 
developed (time 2 = t2). In order to define the efficiency 
of the treatment schemes, hemodynamic measurements 
were done just after the secondary CPB had stopped (time 
3 = t3) and six hours after the starting of IV infusions of 
drugs according to treatment schemes. Additionally, the 
need for restarting CPB, secondary CPB duration (min), 
intraaortic balloon pump usage, intensive care unit stay 
(days) and extubation duration (hours) were recorded in 
all patients.
Analysis of data
Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. or percentages. 
Differences within and among groups were analyzed by

the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney’s 
U-test. All tests were two tailed and a probability value 
of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical ana￾lysis was done with SPSS software (version 6.1, Chicago, 
Illinois, USA).
RESULTS
Protamine reactions
Termination of CPB was uneventful in 3,800 
cases. However, protamine adverse effects devel￾oped in 68 patients during or following protamine 
infusion. Pulmonary artery pressures (PASP, 
PADP, PCWP) and PVR abruptly and significant￾ly increased in all patients (Tables 2 and 3) (p < 
0.05). Right heart distension and tendency to bra￾dycardia developed. The right ventricular con￾tractions decreased whereas the left ventricular 
contractions remained unaffected in the early 
minutes. HR and EF significantly decreased 
whereas CVP significantly increased in both 
groups (p < 0.05). Restarting of CPB was re￾quired in 14 patients (39%) in the PGI2 group, 
whereas in all patients in the control group. Mean 
durations of secondary CPB were 17 ± 7.8 and 38 
± 12 minutes in the PGI2 group and in the control 
group, respectively and the difference between 
the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Treatment of the reactions
PGI2 group. Hemodynamic data after CPB, 
at protamine reactions and after reCPB are shown 
in Table 2. PASP, PADP, PVR and PCWP signifi￾cantly decreased following administration of drug 
combination (p < 0.05). Mean values of PASP, 
PADP, PVR and PCWP were 24 ± 2.1 mmHg, 10 
± 0.9 mmHg, 224 ± 18.6 (dyn × sec)/cm5 and 16 ± 
2.1 mmHg, respectively, six hours after the start￾ing of IV infusion of drugs. Right heart disten￾sion diminished and right ventricular contractions 
improved following administration of drug com￾bination. SSAP, DSAP, HR, CO and CI slightly 
increased (p > 0.05), CVP significantly decreased 
(p < 0.05) whereas EF significantly increased (p < 
0.05). Mean values of SSAP, DSAP, HR, CO, CI,

IV infusion of drugs. SSAP, DSAP, HR, CO, CI 
and EF slightly increased (p > 0.05) and CVP sig￾nificantly increased (p < 0.05) following adminis￾tration of drug combination. Mean values of

± 7.6 mmHg, 70 ± 6.7 mmHg, 72 ± 1.7 per min￾ute, 3.8 ± 1.4 L/min, 2.4 ± 0.6 L/min/m², 38 ± 2.9% 
and 14 ± 1.6 mmHg, respectively, six hours after 
the starting of IV infusion of drugs. The parame￾ters that altered statistically significant following 
administration of the drug combinations in each 
group are shown in Table 4.
Outcome of the patients
Intraaortic balloon pumping was necessary 
in four patients in the PGI2 group and in five pa￾tients in the control group. Mean duration of in￾tensive care stay was 2.4 ± 1.2 and 4.2 ± 1.7 days 
in the PGI2 group and in the control group, re￾spectively. Mean duration of extubation was 8 ± 
1.1 and 14 ± 2.1 hours in the PGI2 group and in 
the control group, respectively. In total five pa￾tients died in the intraoperative and postoperative 
periods. There were two intraoperative deaths 
due to catastrophic pulmonary hypertension, all of 
which were in the control group. There were 
three postoperative deaths: one patient in the PGI2
group and two patients in the control group. One 
patient in the PGI2 group died due to pulmonary 
complications on postoperative third day. Two 
patients in the control group died due to multi-or￾gan failure on postoperative fourth and fifth days, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION
The question addressed by the present study 
was whether prostacyclin is effective in the treat￾ment of protamine-mediated acute pulmonary hy￾pertension and right ventricular failure in the peri￾operative period in isolated CABG operations. 
The main finding of the study is that prostacyclin 
is effective in the treatment of these protamine￾mediated complications in the perioperative peri￾od in isolated CABG operations.
Protamine adverse reactions usually have 
three different categories: systemic hypotension, 
anaphylactoid reactions and catastrophic pulmo￾nary vasoconstriction (Viaro et al. 2002). The 
precise mechanism that explains protamine-medi￾ated systemic hypotension is unknown. However, 
diminished peripheral vascular resistance may be 
a causative factor (Marin-Neto et al. 1979; 
Masone et al. 1982; Shapira et al. 1982; Milne et 
al. 1983; Paulo et al. 1995). In our study, mean 
values of systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, 
cardiac output, cardiac index and left ventricle 
ejection fraction decreased and central venous 
pressure increased following protamine reactions. 
The differences for mean values of SSAP, DSAP, 
CO and CI were not statistically significant in ei￾ther group, and this may suggest a slight systemic 
hypotension. Differences for mean values of HR, 
EF and CVP were statistically significant (p < 
0.05) and this may suggest diminished right ven￾tricular contractions and severe bradycardia. The 
majority of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions 
are associated with complement activation and the 
release of anaphylotoxins complement 3a (C3a) 
and 5a (C5a) (Hobbhahn et al. 1991). Morel et al. 
(1987) found increased plasma levels of trombox￾ane B2 (TxB2) and C5a levels in patients who de￾veloped acute pulmonary hypertension and sys￾temic hypotension following right atrial protamine 
injection. Anaphylactoid reactions result in cata￾strophic pulmonary vasoconstriction which in￾duces right and eventually global ventricular fail￾ure (Hobbhahn et al. 1991). In our study, 
pulmonary artery pressures and PVR increased in 
all patients during protamine infusion. However, 
differences were statistically insignificant in both 
groups and this may suggest a mild form of an 
anaphylactic reaction rather than a catastrophic 
pulmonary vasoconstriction except in two patients 
in the control group.
When protamine-mediated right ventricular 
failure and acute pulmonary hypertension occurs, 
the basis of the treatment is to reduce pulmonary 
artery pressure and maintain systemic arterial 
pressure and right ventricular contractility. 
Vasodilators such as nitroglycerin and phosphodi￾esterase inhibitors may be useful in this setting. 
We used dopamine for bradycardia, whereas nor￾epinephrine was given to fight acute peripheral 
vasodilation caused by abrupt decrease of system-

56 A. Ocal et al. Prostacyclin for Protamine-Mediated Reactions 57
ic vascular resistance. In addition, nitric oxide 
(NO) is an important endothelium-derived relax￾ing factor and produces profound relaxation of 
vascular smooth muscle. Fratacci et al found that 
inhaled NO is a selective pulmonary vasodilator 
that can prevent thromboxane-induced pulmonary 
hypertension during the heparin-protamine reac￾tion in lambs and can do so without causing sys￾temic vasodilation (Fratacci et al. 1991).
Prostacyclin (PGI2) and TxA2 are the pre￾dominant cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic 
acid. PGI2 is mainly formed by vascular endoteli￾um and dilates both bronchial and vascular
smooth muscle whereas TxA2 is formed by plate￾lets and constricts bronchial and vascular smooth 
muscle. Disturbance of the balance between pros￾taglandin and TxA2 in favor of TxA2 by prot￾amine may be considered a causative factor in the 
etiology of acute pulmonary vasoconstriction and 
consequently acute pulmonary hypertension. It 
was the basis for adding PGI2 to norepinephrine 
and dopamine in therapy scheme in our study.
When t 2 and t 3 were compared in the PGI2
group, there was a statistically significant differ￾ence for all pulmonary pressures and PVR (p < 
0.05). This may suggests that PGI2 effectively 
decreased pulmonary pressures and PVR. 
However, when same comparison was done, there 
was a statistically significant difference for only 
PVR (p < 0.05). This may suggest that nitroglyc￾erin is also an useful agent but is not as effective 
as PGI2 in the fight against acute pulmonary hy￾pertension.
The number of patients who required restart￾ing of CPB was lower in the PGI2 group than in 
the control group (38% vs 100%). The mean du￾ration of secondary CPB was shorter in the PGI2
group than in the control group. These indicate 
the possible beneficial effects of PGI2 on lower 
necessity of secondary CPB and shorter CPB du￾rations. Additionally, mean duration of intensive 
care stay and mean duration of extubation were 
shorter in the PGI2 group than in the control 
group, indicating a more favorable postoperative 
course in the PGI2 group.
A few potential pharmacologic agents are 
under development as alternatives to protamine. 
Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a naturally occurring 
protein synthesized in megakaryocytes and even￾tually stored in the alpha granules of platelets for 
later release. Although the complete physiologic 
role of PF4 is unknown, it is highly effective for 
the neutralization of heparin anticoagulation. 
Several preliminary animal studies and trials us￾ing blood obtained from cardiopulmonary bypass 
circuits suggested recombinant PF4 would be an 
effective alternative to protamine (Shanberge et 
al. 1987; Cook et al. 1992; Bernabei et al. 1995; 
Dehmer et al. 1995; Levy et al. 1995; Mixon et al. 
2004). Heparinase I, a specific enzyme that inac￾tivates heparin, is another possible alternative to 
protamine (Michelsen et al. 1996). Heres et al. 
(2001) found that heparinase-I successfully re￾stored activated coagulation time with no adverse 
hemodynamic events in patients undergoing coro￾nary artery surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass 
in an open-label dose-determining trial. Finally, 
heparin-binding filters have been also considered 
as an alternative to protamine but additional hu￾man studies are needed to demonstrate the safety 
and efficacy of the method (Ma et al. 1992).
In conclusion, our findings suggest that pros￾tacyclin (PGI2) is effective in the treatment of 
protamine-mediated acute pulmonary hyperten￾sion and right ventricular failure during the peri￾operative period in isolated CABG operations. 
However, additional data from further studies is 
required to clarify the role of PGI2 in the treat￾ment of these complications.
