Evidence for a major role of genetic factors in the determination of body mass index (BMI)
comes from studies of related individuals. Despite consistent evidence for a heritable com￾ponent of BMI, estimates of BMI heritability vary widely between studies and the reasons
for this remain unclear. While some variation is natural due to differences between popu￾lations and settings, study design factors may also explain some of the heterogeneity. We
performed a systematic review that identified 88 independent estimates of BMI heritabil￾ity from twin studies (total 140,525 twins) and 27 estimates from family studies (42,968
family members). BMI heritability estimates from twin studies ranged from 0.47 to 0.90
(5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.58/0.75/0.87) and were generally higher than those from fam￾ily studies (range: 0.24–0.81; 5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.25/0.46/0.68). Meta-regression of
the results from twin studies showed that BMI heritability estimates were 0.07 (P = 0.001)
higher in children than in adults; estimates increased with mean age among childhood stud￾ies (+0.012/year, P = 0.002), but decreased with mean age in adult studies (−0.002/year,
P = 0.002). Heritability estimates derived from AE twin models (which assume no contri￾bution of shared environment) were 0.12 higher than those from ACE models (P < 0.001),
whilst lower estimates were associated with self reported versus DNA-based determina￾tion of zygosity (−0.04, P = 0.02), and with self reported versus measured BMI (−0.05,
P = 0.03). Although the observed differences in heritability according to aspects of study
design are relatively small, together, the above factors explained 47% of the heterogeneity
in estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies. In summary, while some variation in BMI
heritability is expected due to population-level differences, study design factors explained
nearly half the heterogeneity reported in twin studies. The genetic contribution to BMI
appears to vary with age and may have a greater influence during childhood than adult life.

INTRODUCTION
Studies of twins and families have quantified the contribution of
genetic variation to inter-individual differences in body mass index
(BMI). In the last comprehensive review of BMI heritability, Maes
et al. (1997) reported that the proportion of phenotypic variance
(VP) that can be attributed to genetic factors (h2) ranged from 0.40
to 0.90 in twin studies and 0.20 to 0.50 in family studies, demon￾strating the wide variation in the magnitude of BMI heritability
observed both within and between these study designs (Maes et al.,
1997). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far iden￾tified 32 loci robustly associated with adult BMI (Frayling et al.,
2007; Loos et al., 2008; Thorleifsson et al., 2009; Willer et al., 2009;
Speliotes et al., 2010). Despite highly statistically significant asso￾ciations, these 32 loci account for less than 2% of the total VP in
BMI. Sub-genome-wide significant variants may be able to explain
a substantial portion of the unexplained genetic variance of com￾plex traits. However, even when considering such variants, the
Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; DZ, dizygotic; MZ, monozygotic.
variance explained remains lower than estimates of heritability
(Yang et al., 2011) and much attention has been focused on finding
the so-called “missing heritability” (Manolio et al., 2009).
Twin studies are used to quantify genetic and environmental
contributions to variation in BMI by comparing intra-pair con￾cordance between monozygotic (MZ) twins and dizygotic (DZ)
twins. Assignment of zygosity (MZ or DZ) to twin pairs is achieved
either using questionnaires or more accurate DNA-based meth￾ods. Twin studies model the VP to be the composite of up to
four components: (A) additive genetic factors; (D) non-additive
or dominant genetic factors; (C) shared environmental factors;
and (E) non-shared environmental factors (Neale and Cardon,
1992; Rijsdijk and Sham, 2002). Heritability is usually reported
as the proportion of overall VP that can be attributed to additive
genetic factors (h2 =A/Vp), as dominant genetic factors (D) are
confounded with shared environmental factors (C) and cannot be
estimated in the same model. The “best estimate” of heritability is
calculated from the statistically best fitting and most parsimonious
combination of the three remaining variance components (A, C,
and E), determined by sequentially removing components from

the model and testing for deterioration in fit in structural equation
modeling (Rijsdijk and Sham, 2002; Figure A1 in Appendix).
Quantitative genetic analysis in family studies also allows vari￾ance in BMI to be partitioned into genetic and environmental
components. Estimates of familiality indicate to what extent mem￾bers of the same family share traits (representing the A, D, and
C components of VP combined) to infer an inherited compo￾nent. Heritability estimates can be estimated by maximum like￾lihood variance decomposition (Almasy and Blangero, 1998) or
by regressing offspring phenotype onto mean parental phenotype
(Lawlor and Mishra, 2009). However, it should be noted that fam￾ily studies cannot explain to what extent this familial similarity
arisesfrom genetic relatedness as opposed to shared environmental
factors.
We aimed to identify papers that have estimated the heritability
of BMI, and to identify and quantify by meta-regression the effects
of demographic and methodological factors that contribute to the
heterogeneity between estimates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
LITERATURE SEARCH
Papers that reported BMI heritability were identified on PubMed.
A search was performed in February 2010 with the term “heritabil￾ity,” combined with the MeSH term “body mass index,” limited to
human studies reported in the English language, and this gen￾erated 209 papers. Titles and abstracts were assessed for their
relevance; inclusion criteria were twin or family studies reporting
a quantitative estimate for BMI heritability (h2) as a measure of
additive genetic factors (N = 64 papers). Supplementary searches
(for example, using the term “genetic contribution” rather than
heritability) were performed together with cross-referencing to
identify further studies that had not been captured by the original
search. For papers duplicating estimates from the same popula￾tions, either the study reporting a secondary analysis or using a
smaller subset of the dataset was excluded (N = 10). One study
was excluded because it reported the heritability of maximal life￾time BMI. To enable a quantitative meta-analysis, measures of
uncertainty for the heritability estimates were required. For twin
study papers not reporting SE or confidence intervals, heritability,
and confidence intervals were calculated directly. This calculation
was not possible if twin studies also did not report MZ/DZ correla￾tions (N = 6), mean BMI by zygosity (N = 4), or SD of mean BMI
by zygosity (N = 2). Family studies not reporting SE or confidence
intervals for BMI heritability were also excluded (N = 6). In total,
31 papers reporting twin studies and 25 papers reporting family
studies were eligible for inclusion (Figure A2 in Appendix); many
of these papers reported estimates from more than one study.
DATA EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION
Estimates of BMI heritability as a measure of additive genetic
components were extracted from each paper, where possible by
independent subgroup based on sex, age group, ethnicity, or set￾ting, the source study and, in twin studies, whether twins were
raised apart or together. Information was also obtained on the
location of the study, the study to which the twins or family
members were recruited (where relevant) and the mean age, age
range, and number of participants in each study. Twin studies
were categorized according to: whether they were conducted in
adults (>18 years) or children (≤18 years); the variance compo￾nent model used to derive the best heritability estimates (ACE
versus AE); the method used to assign zygosity (DNA or biolog￾ical versus questionnaire); and whether BMI was calculated from
objective measurements or self reported body size. Where studies
had used mixed strategies to determine twin zygosity, for example
if they DNA tested uncertain cases, they were categorized as using
a DNA-based/biological strategy.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For studies that did not report measures of uncertainty around
BMI heritability, heritability estimates, and their confidence inter￾vals were re-calculated using OpenMx (Boker et al., 2011). Firstly,
datasets were simulated based on the reported number of MZ and
DZ twins in each study and the mean and SD of BMI in each class of
twins. Structural equation modeling was then used to decompose
the variance in BMI into additive genetic, shared environmental
and unique environmental components based on intra-class cor￾relations of BMI in MZ and DZ twin pairs. In studies that reported
heritability from AE models, we also excluded the C component in
our re-calculation. To make this analysis more robust, a bootstrap￾ping approach was applied,whereby twin pairs were sampled 1,000
times for each heritability estimate. Re-calculated estimates were
highly correlated with originally reported estimates (r = 0.91).
A meta-analysis of the reported or re-calculated estimates of
heritability from each study was performed separately for twin
and family studies using metan in Stata (Version 11.0). A random
effects model was used which accounts for inter-study heterogene￾ity.Where possible, estimates from men and women were included
separately in the twin study meta-analysis, and subgroup estimates
by sex were calculated. In longitudinal studies, the baseline her￾itability or the estimate based on the measurement with largest
number of twins was selected. To investigate potential explana￾tions for heterogeneity in estimates across twin studies, random
effects meta-regression analyses were conducted using the metareg
(Sharp, 1998; Harbord and Steichen, 2004) command in Stata. In
these analyses, weights are assigned according to the inverse of the
total variance, comprising the individual study variance and the
residual between study variance. The influence of sex, age, setting
(populations of white compared with East Asian descent), pub￾lication year, sample size, choice of variance component model,
method used to determine zygosity and method used to determine
BMI were quantified. To test for effects of age on BMI heritability,
twin study estimates from adults versus children were compared.
Secondly, as we have observed biphasic patterns of age modifica￾tion of genetic effects of FTO and MC4R on BMI and body weight
(Hardy et al., 2010), a meta-regression of mean age (or, when this
was not reported, the mid-point of the age range as a proxy) was
performed in childhood and adulthood studies separately. A sim￾ilar meta-regression was performed on family study estimates to
test for any detectable effects of sample size, mean, or mid age
of participants, publication year, and setting of the study (US or
European versus East Asian).
The overall heterogeneity in BMI estimates explained by all
significant factors was calculated as the proportion of the τ2 sta￾tistic, which measures between study variance (Thompson and
Frontiers in Endocrinology | Genomic Endocrinology February 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 29 | 2

Elks et al. Variability in BMI heritability estimates
Sharp, 1999), that is accounted for when including these covari￾ates in a meta-regression model. This analysis was based on 70
heritability estimates which could be categorized into adulthood
or childhood, AE or ACE models, biological or questionnaire￾based zygosity determination and self report or objective BMI
assessment.
RESULTS
TWIN STUDIES

0.90 (5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.58/0.75/0.87; Figure 1). In some
papers, estimates were reported separately by sex, age subgroup,
or geographical location. The overall sample represented a total

of 30,702 twins between the study samples, the pooled analy￾sis comprised at least 140,525 independent twins. Between study
heterogeneity across these estimates was substantial (I 2 = 86.1%,
P < 0.001; Figure 2).
DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS
In estimates from twin studies, there were similar overall heri￾tability estimates for men (0.73; 95% CI: 0.71–0.76) and women
(0.75; 95% CI: 0.73–0.77; Figure 2). This was confirmed by
meta-regression, which found no effect of sex on the heritabil￾ity estimate (Table 2). Nineteen of the 88 heritability estimates
from twin studies were from children and adolescents (≤18 years),
whilst 67 were in adulthood (two estimates were from pop￾ulations that included participants spanning both childhood
and adulthood). Meta-regression showed that, on average, BMI
heritability in childhood was 0.07 higher (95% CI: 0.03–0.11,
P = 0.001) than in adulthood (Table 2). Heritability estimates
rose by 0.012/year throughout childhood (age ≤18 years; 95%
CI: 0.005–0.019, P = 0.002), but decreased by −0.002/year in

adulthood (95% CI: −0.004 to −0.001, P = 0.002; Figure 3). BMI
heritability from East Asian populations (N = 5 populations) was
0.11 higher than that in populations of white European descent
(95% CI: 0.03–0.18, P = 0.006), but this difference diminished
after adjustment for age category (child versus adult studies; 0.06;
95% CI: −0.02–0.15, P = 0.125). The influence of birth cohort
(year of birth of the twins) on heritability estimates was diffi￾cult to assess because some studies did not report the birth year
of the participants and others reported large ranges, sometimes
spanning multiple decades. More recent publication year was
nominally associated with heritability in meta-regression analyses
(0.003/+1 year, P = 0.055). However, this association was attenu￾ated after adjustment for age category (child versus adult studies;
P = 0.405).
METHODOLOGICAL FACTORS
The number of twins included in each estimate of BMI heritability
ranged from 66 to 8,142 individuals. In meta-regression mod￾els, sample size was unrelated to the BMI heritability estimates
(P = 0.202, adjusted for age category). Fifteen of the best esti￾mates of BMI heritability from twin studies were derived from
the three-component ACE model, while the more parsimonious
AE model was chosen as the best fitting model for 61 estimates.
Eight estimates were derived from the ADE model and four esti￾mates were obtained by direct comparisons of the within-pair
correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Best estimates
from AE variance component models were on average 0.12 higher
than those from ACE models (P = 0.005), adjusted for age cate￾gory (Table 3). When stratified into childhood or adult studies,
this difference was of similar magnitude in children (0.11, 95%
CI: 0.06–0.17, P = 0.001) and adults (0.13, 95% CI: 0.008–0.26,
P = 0.038).
A total of 33 of the 88 twin study estimates used DNA or bio￾logical (blood typing or fingerprints) assignment of zygosity; the
remaining 55 relied completely on questionnaire-based methods.
Reliance on questionnaires to determine zygosity (compared with
DNA or other biological methods) was associated with a 0.04 lower
heritability estimate (P = 0.02), when adjusted for age category.
Similarly, the heritability was on average 0.05 lower (P = 0.03)
in studies that calculated BMI based on self reported height and
weight (N = 59 estimates) compared with studies (N = 21 esti￾mates) that objectively assessed BMI. Eight study estimates based
on a combination of both methods were excluded from this
meta-regression analysis.
Together, age category, type of variance component model,
method of zygosity assignment and BMI measurement, explained
46.7% of the between study heterogeneity in BMI heritability.
FAMILY STUDIES
A total of 28 independent estimates of BMI heritability were
reported in 25 family study papers retrieved comprising 42,968
family members (Table 4; Longini et al., 1984; Hunt et al., 1989,
2002; Moll et al., 1991; Vogler et al., 1995; Bijkerk et al., 1999;

Bogaert et al., 2008; de Oliveira et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2008;
Friedlander et al., 2009; Zabaneh et al., 2009; Figure 1). Reported
BMI heritability estimates ranged from 0.24 to 0.81 (5th/50th/95th
centiles: 0.25/0.46/0.68),with substantial heterogeneity across esti￾mates (I 2 = 90.4%, P < 0.001; Figure 4). Meta-regression found
no significant effect of sample size, age, setting, or publication year
on heritability estimates in family studies (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In a large meta-analysis of more than 140,525 twins and 42,968
family members, we observed that estimates of BMI heritability
remain broadly in line with results from the earlier review by Maes
et al. (1997). A substantial amount of the variation between esti￾mates from twin studies could be explained by considering demo￾graphic and methodological factors. Estimates from twin studies
suggest that the influence of genetic factors on BMI is relatively
higher in children than in adults. In addition, we have identified
and quantified the likely effects of three potential methodological
biases in twin studies; these are the choice of final variance com￾ponent model, and the use of subjective methods to assess both
zygosity and BMI. Together these factors explained nearly half
of the wide heterogeneity in BMI heritability estimates between
studies.
Our finding of a biphasic change in the heritability of BMI with
age, increasing with age in children and adolescents and decreas￾ing with age adults, is entirely consistent with studies using specific
genetic variants. Hardy et al. (2010) reported that the effect size
of the rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO
on BMI rises until around age 20 years, before gradually attenu￾ating into adulthood. We acknowledge limitations in our analysis

including the lack of longitudinal information and reliance on
the mean or mid-point of age used in meta-regression analyses.
However, in support of our findings, the heritability of BMI has
previously been shown to increase over childhood (Haworth et al.,
2008) and decrease with age in adults (Korkeila et al., 1991) in twin
studies with longitudinal data.
We found no difference in BMI heritability estimates between
men and women. Individual studies have been inconsistent; some

have reported higher BMI heritability estimates in women (Allison
et al., 1994; Harris et al., 1995; Estourgie-van Burk et al., 2006),
whilst others have reported the opposite finding (Stunkard et al.,
1990; Korkeila et al., 1991). Other studies have found no dif￾ference or reported a pooled heritability estimate for men and
women combined. BMI heritability does not differentiate fat and
fat free mass heritability, and given the differences in body com￾position between sexes, it is plausible that genetic contributions to
the variation in BMI may operate differently in men and women.
Hur et al. (2008) reported that heritability estimates for weight,
height, and BMI were consistently higher in Caucasian compared
with East Asian populations. However, in that study the observed
differences were small and confidence intervals were overlap￾ping. In this study, no significant difference was found in the
magnitude of BMI heritability from European and East Asian
settings after accounting for whether the studies were in child￾hood or adulthood; however there were only a few studies in East
Asians.
The majority of studies reported estimates of BMI heritabil￾ity from the more parsimonious AE variance component model,
rather than from the more complete ACE model. Not surprisingly,
heritability (variance attributed to the A component) was higher in
studies reporting the AE model, presumably because the variance
that would have been attributed to C is re-allocated to compo￾nents A and E in these analyses. Silventoinen et al. (2010) reported
that the C component was relevant to BMI variation only in chil￾dren up to age 13 years old. However, we found that exclusion
of the C component had a similar magnitude of effect on higher
heritability estimates in both children and adults. While omission
of the C component is statistically best fitting in some analyses,
smaller twin studies are often underpowered to identify a signifi￾cant contribution of this component (Visscher et al., 2008a). These
findings suggest that it may be inappropriate to simply ignore any
contribution relating to common environmental factors.
The twin study design relies on the accurate identification of
MZ and DZ twin pairs. The “gold standard” method is by DNA
typing of all twins but, before genotyping technologies became
widespread and cost–effective, questionnaire-based methods were
common and were used to generate more than half of the BMI her￾itability estimates that we identified. Such questionnaires are based
on subjective assessment of physical resemblance and, although
some have been validated against genetic and biological methods
(Sarna et al., 1978; Ooki et al., 1993), any non-differential mis￾classification error would inflate the E component and reduce the
additive genetic component. Similarly, non-differential errors in
self reported height and weight to calculate BMI would also inflate
the unique environment component. These findings are consistent
with those of Macgregor et al. (2006), who showed that heritability
estimates for self reported height were lower than for objectively
measured height.
Heritability estimates from twin studies are considerably higher
than estimates from family studies. Twin studies are generally
thought to provide a more robust discrimination between envi￾ronmental and genetic contributions due to the more precise
estimation of shared genetic factors and the automatic match￾ing for age, prenatal environment, and birth cohort. However, it

is suggested that the twin study design overestimates heritability
because of its over-reliance on critical assumptions (Kyvik, 2000).
The most commonly highlighted assumption is that of equal com￾mon environments in identical and non-identical twin pairs. In
reality, MZ twin pairs may share a common environment to a
larger extent than DZ pairs,which would lead to an overestimation
of heritability (Hettema et al., 1995; Guo, 2001). This can be over￾come by studying twin pairs who were separated at birth (Stunkard
et al., 1990), a natural experiment whereby individuals are geneti￾cally identical but environmentally different. However, such twins
are rare and difficult to study, as adoption data is not easy to obtain.
Family studies do not invoke some of the problems of the twin
study design. For example, questions of equal environments and
accurate zygosity recording are eliminated and singletons are more
representative of the general population than twins (Estourgie-van
Burk et al., 2006). However, the family study design does not per￾mit the differentiation of familial similarity arising from genetics
as opposed to shared environmental conditions. In addition, in
family studies, parents and children are usually measured at very
different ages, often across generations, and lack of consideration
of age–genotype interactions will lead to under-estimation of heri￾tability. This might explain why heritability estimates are generally
lower in family studies despite the fact that they do not distinguish
between genetic and shared environmental variance components.
A limitation of this study was the inability to distinguish effects
of demographic and methodological factors from other correlated
Frontiers in Endocrinology | Genomic Endocrinology February 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 29 | 10

Elks et al. Variability in BMI heritability estimates
study characteristics. For example, studies on children are likely to
be over-representative of individuals from more recent birth years,
making it difficult to separate effects of age and era. Genetic fac￾tors may have been relatively more important before the onset of
the obesogenic environment, but others have suggested that these
conditions may amplify the effects of obesity susceptibility loci
(Andreasen et al., 2008). Era effects were difficult to assess in this
study and the separation of birth cohort and age effects on BMI
heritability requires confirmation by longitudinal data from large
twin cohort studies spanning wide eras.
It should be noted that the models used to calculate heritabil￾ity are often based on the unlikely assumption that there is no
synergistic interaction between genes. Although the study designs
discussed here do not usually permit their determination because
of confounding with effects of the common environment, non￾additive genetic factors may also play an important role (Segal
and Allison, 2002). Furthermore, gene–environment interaction
is not accounted for in these studies, and any such contribution is
allocated to the A component (Visscher et al., 2008b).
It is important to emphasize that there is no single true value
for heritability, as the balance between genetic and environmental
contributions will naturally vary with the environmental setting
and genetic lineage. However, we now show that issues relating to
study design also explain a substantial part of the differences in the
reported estimates of BMI heritability. In family studies we were
unable to explain any of the heterogeneity across estimates. How￾ever, it is likely that other unmeasured factors, for example more
precise measurement of geographical and population-level envi￾ronmental factors such as urban versus rural setting, recreational
facilities, nutritional availability, affluence, and also cultural fac￾tors and ethnicity, might contribute to the remaining variability in
BMI heritability estimates in both twin and family studies.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, while many studies in the current GWAS era report
estimates from heritability studies as a rationale to look for spe￾cific genetic factors for complex traits, it should be emphasized
that “missing” heritability is difficult to quantify given the wide
heterogeneity in these estimates due to both natural variation and
differences in study design. Given the higher heritability estimates
in childhood and adolescence, focusing on periods of growth
and development to study the genetic etiology of obesity risk is
justified.

Elks et al. Variability in BMI heritability estimates
APPENDIX
FIGURE A1 | Modeling heritability in twin studies. This diagram shows
how twin studies can model variance components, based on the path
diagram proposed by Neale and Cardon (1992). The lines adjoining variance
components indicate the degree of correlation (r), shown for both
monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Additive genetic variance (A) is
100% correlated for MZ twin pairs and 50% correlated for DZ twin pairs.
Common environment is shared (C) 100% by both types of twin. E represents
a unique environmental component, and hence there is no correlation.
Statistical modeling allows phenotypic variance to be quantitatively
decomposed into A, C, and E subcomponents (the ACE model). The estimate
of A gives a measure of the heritability of the trait. In a more parsimonious AE
model, the C component would be missing from this diagram.
