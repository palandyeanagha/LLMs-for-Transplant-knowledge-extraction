Abstract
BACKGROUND In a retrospective study the value of
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the diagnosis of pneumonia was
investigated in 95 immunocompromised patients suffering from
haematological disorders and receiving a regimen of broad
spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents (BSAR).
METHODS With the exception of four afebrile patients, all had
fever, raised C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and new infiltrates
visible on chest radiography. All patients underwent BAL to identify
the organism causing the pneumonia and surveillance cultures were
performed regularly for pathogens at different sites. Following
classification of the isolates, patients with positive cultures were
subdivided into two groups, pathogenic or contaminated. We
investigated whether relevant pathogens were cultured only from
the BAL fluid and whether they were susceptible to BSAR.
RESULTS Although 77 of the 95 patients were thrombocytopenic,
bleeding during BAL occurred in only 15% of all patients. Ten days
after the procedure the fever improved in 88% of patients,
radiographic findings improved in 71%, and CRP levels improved in
75% of patients; 22% of patients died within 28 days.
Pathologically relevant isolates were found in 65% of all patients.
Respiratory pathogens were detected only in the BAL fluid of 29 of
the 95 patients (35% Gram positive species, 40% Gram negative
species, 11% Mycobacterium, 11% fungi, and 3% cytomegalovirus).
In 16 of these 29 patients (55%) the pathogens cultured only from
the BAL fluid were resistant to treatment. Pathogens detected only
in the BAL fluid were not susceptible to a standard broad spectrum
antibiotic and antifungal regimen including teicoplanin, ceftriaxon,
tobramycin, and amphotericin B in 12 of the 29 patients (41%).
CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that 12 patients were treated with
broad spectrum antimicrobial agents which were not directed at the


appropriate organism on in vitro sensitivity tests without BAL. BAL
is a relatively safe procedure in the diagnosis of pneumonia,
supplying important information in immunocompromised patients
as well as in immunocompromised patients receiving BSAR.
