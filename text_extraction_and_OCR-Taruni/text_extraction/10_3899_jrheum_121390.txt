ABSTRACT. Objective. To determine survival and causes of death in an unselected and complete cohort of
Norwegian patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) compared to the background population.
Methods. Multiple methods were used to identify every patient with SSc living in southeast Norway,
with a denominator population of 2,707,012, between 1999 and 2009. All patients who met either
the American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Medsger and LeRoy criteria for SSc were
included. Every patient was matched for sex and age with 15 healthy controls drawn from the
national population registry. Vital status at January 1, 2010, was provided for patients and controls
by the national population registry. Causes of death were obtained from death certificates and by
chart review. 
Results. Forty-three (14%) of 312 patients with SSc died during the study period. The standardized
mortality rate (SMR) was estimated to be 2.03 for the entire cohort and 5.33 for the subgroup with
diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 91% and 70%, respectively, for
dcSSc and 98% and 93% for limited cutaneous (lc) SSc. Causes of death were related to SSc in 24/43
(56%) patients, mostly cardiopulmonary diseases (n = 13), including pulmonary hypertension 
(n = 8). Factors associated with fatal outcome included male sex, dcSSc, pulmonary hypertension,
and interstitial lung disease. 
Conclusion. Compared to the Norwegian background population, our cohort of 312 unselected
patients with SSc had decreased survival. The survival rates observed were, however, better than
those previously reported from SSc referral centers. (First Release May 1 2013; J Rheumatol

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a serious multiorgan disease
characterized by progressive vasculopathy, fibrosis, and
distinct serum autoantibodies1,2. The etiology of SSc is
largely unknown, but involves both genetic and environ￾mental factors3. Classification of SSc is still done with the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification
criteria from 19804, but alternative classification criteria are
increasingly used, particularly the Medsger and LeRoy
system, which divides patients into 3 subsets: diffuse
cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), and
limited SSc (lSSc)5. SSc incidence data vary from 0.6 to
19/100,000 and prevalence rates range from 5/100,000 to
30/100,0006. Recently, we estimated the prevalence of SSc
in Norway at 9.9/100,0007.
SSc is clearly a disorder with increased mortality, but the
observed mortality rates differ considerably between
studies. Reported standardized mortality ratios (SMR) range
from 1.5 to 7.28,9,10,11,12,13 and the 5- and 10-year
cumulative survival estimates range from 80% to 90% and
60% to 85%, respectively13,14,15,16,17,18. Moreover, the
frequency of deaths related to SSc varies from 30% to
80%13,19,20,21,22,23,24. Because most previous mortality
studies in SSc were conducted in single centers with
selected cohorts, the large variations may partly be
explained by selection bias. Also, previous studies used
different SSc criteria and life tables, rather than disease
control groups, to determine the SMR. Notwithstanding,
patients with SSc continue to carry one of the highest risks
of mortality of all connective tissue diseases24,25.
Factors previously associated with increased mortality
have included male sex, older age at disease onset, dcSSc
subtype, and the presence of serum antitopoisomerase I

antibodies (ATA) as well as cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
renal disease involvement14,24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35.
Norway is particularly suitable for mortality studies
because of reliable mortality statistics, which are necessary
to evaluate the health effects of diseases at the population
level. We recently established an unselected SSc cohort,
which includes every identifiable patient in southeast
Norway (population 2.7 million). The patients were
included by the ACR and Medsger and Leroy criteria and
were followed for a mean 11 years with no loss to followup.
Using the unique possibility of comparing patients with
controls matched for sex/age from the national population
registry, we were able to obtain complete SMR data. We
describe the survival and causes of death of unselected
patients with SSc in southeast Norway compared to the
Norwegian background population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study cohort. The study cohort, which included every identifiable patient
with SSc living in the study area between January 1, 1999, and December
31, 2009, has been described7. Briefly, 5 different acquisition routes were
used as follows to identify all patients in the study area who had been regis￾tered with an SSc diagnosis code (i.e., M34) according to the 10th revised
version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which has
been used in all Norwegian hospitals since 1999. (1) The Norwegian
Systemic Connective Tissue Disease And Vasculitis Registry at the
Department of Rheumatology, Oslo University Hospital (OUH) was
searched. (2) All the other 7 departments of rheumatology in southeast
Norway were asked to search their hospital databases. (3) All rheumatology
consultants practicing within the study region were invited to provide
details of patients under their care whom they considered to have SSc. (4)
The 1 rheumatology department for children in Norway (located at OUH)
was asked to search its database for juvenile patients with SSc. (5) The
Department of Dermatology at the OUH (the only dermatology department
in southeast Norway) was asked to search its database for SSc patients not
taken care of by the rheumatology department. Because every person living
in Norway has a unique Norwegian identity number, no patients were
double-registered.
The study was approved by the regional committee of health and
medical research ethics in southeast Norway.
Disease characteristics. All the 312 patients fulfilled either the ACR
criteria or the Medsger and LeRoy criteria for SSc4,5. Patients were divided
into 3 subgroups: (1) lSSc with Raynaud phenomenon (RP) plus SSc-type
nailfold capillary pattern or SSc selective autoantibodies; (2) lcSSc with
skin thickening distal to the elbow/knee; and (3) dcSSc7,24.
Disease onset was defined as the timepoint when the first non-RP
symptom was reported and was retrospectively registered from 1965 until
study end. The observation period was terminated by the end of 2009 or at
the time of death. Disease duration was defined as the time from onset of
the first non-RP symptom to the end of the observation period or to time of
death. The period from first non-RP symptom to time of SSc diagnosis was
defined as diagnostic delay. The period from the SSc diagnosis until study
end or death was defined as the followup time.
Clinical characteristics. The presence of the following disease measures
during the disease course was recorded retrospectively by chart review: (1)
serum autoantibody status: antinuclear antibody (ANA), anticentromere
antibody (ACA), and ATA; (2) digital ulcers (DU); (3) scleroderma renal
crisis (SRC); (4) gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) as evidenced by
gastroscopy; (5) the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) as evidenced
by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs and
pulmonary function tests (PFT); and (6) pulmonary hypertension (PH). The
presence of PH was defined according to the latest criteria from the
European Society of Cardiology as mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)
≥ 25 mm HG by right heart catheterization (RHC) at rest36. RHC was
conducted when PH was suspected clinically and/or by elevated systolic
PAP by echocardiography. All patients who underwent RHC were
evaluated by an experienced cardiologist to exclude that the PH was
secondary to heart disease.
In accord with recent PH criteria37, the PH was classified as
ILD-associated (PH-ILD) if the patient had a restrictive PFT pattern with
forced vital capacity (FVC) < 70% and severe lung fibrosis on HRCT of the
lungs, while patients who had FVC > 70% or no/mild HRCT abnormalities
were classified as having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). ILD was
staged as mild or extensive according to the criteria suggested by Goh, et
al38. We had access to charts on all 312 patients, but not all the charts had
complete data on every clinical variable. In the statistical analyses, missing
data were recorded as “parameter not present.” To assess the influence of
clinical variables on mortality, OR were calculated. Patients’ treatment was
not evaluated.
Assessment of SMR and survival rates. Using the personal identification
numbers, we were able to identify every death and all the reported causes
of death in the SSc cohort between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2010.
Vital status at the end of the study was established by contacting the
Norwegian Central Person Register and by chart review. To calculate the
SMR, Statistics Norway provided a control group from the general
Norwegian population. Altogether, 15 random controls were selected for
each individual patient with SSc. The controls were matched with the SSc
patients for sex, year of birth, and residence area. Additionally, all 15
controls were alive on the date of patient’s disease onset. For calculation of
SMR in the followup period we excluded all controls dying during the
period of diagnostic delay and reduced the number of controls per patient
accordingly. Cumulative survival rates were computed by the
Kaplan-Meier method and significance was tested with the log-rank test.
Survival curves were compared to curves of the control group.
Causes of death. Causes of death were based on information from medical
charts (38 patients), death certificates (all 43 deceased patients), and
autopsy (1 patient). When the information from the different sources was
not consistent (4 patients), we used data from the medical chart and not
from the death certificate. On 3 death certificates, SSc was not mentioned
as a contributing cause of death (cause of death unknown). Causes of death
of the control group were given by Statistics Norway. The causes of death
of SSc patients were classified as SSc-related mortality and mortality
unrelated to SSc. SSc-related deaths were defined as deaths related to
progressive, active SSc or deaths caused by organ failure directly related to
SSc. Deaths unrelated to SSc were of all other causes and divided into
several subgroups. If there was no notification on the death certificate or in
the patient chart, the cause of death was defined as “unknown.” 
Statistics. All information was imported to the Microsoft Office Access
database after scanning with Cardiff Teleform 10.1 software. Statistical
analyses were performed by SPSS, version 18. Causes of death were
analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves and significance were tested with the log-rank test. Items with
significant effects on survival were entered into the Cox proportional
hazards model. The SMR was calculated as the ratio between the observed
rate of death in the SSc cohort and the observed rate of death in the com￾parable age- and sex-matched control group from Statistics Norway, repre￾senting the Norwegian background population. The association between
potential risk factors and mortality was quantified by OR with 95% CI.
Further, all independent risk factors significantly associated with SSc from
the univariate analysis were considered as candidates in the multivariate
logistic regression analysis. In the univariate analysis we considered the
following potential risk factors: sex, age, disease subtype, ANA, ACA, ATA,
GAVE, DU, SRC, ILD, and PAH. A manual backward stepwise elimination
procedure using a multivariate logistic regression model was performed to
identify independent risk factors of mortality. Multivariate analyses were
preceded by estimation of correlation between risk factors. Differences in

clinical findings between survivors and deceased patients were analyzed
using Pearson chi-square test for contingency tables for categorical variables
and independent sample t test for continuous variables. 
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical variables. The total study cohort
consisted of 95% whites and included 312 patients who
fulfilled the ACR classification criteria for SSc and/or the
Medsger and LeRoy criteria (Table 1). Forty-three (14%) of
these 312 patients died during the study period from
December 31, 1999, until January 1, 2010. The deceased
patient group had a higher mean age at disease onset and
higher mean age at diagnosis and at death, but the same
mean disease duration as the group of surviving patients
(Table 1). The mean diagnostic delay was 2.9 years (SD
4.3). The deceased patient group consisted of 6 men with
lcSSc and 9 with dcSSc compared to 20 women with lcSSc
and 8 with dcSSc. Men with dcSSc had a higher mortality
(43%) compared to women with dcSSc (17%) and to men
and women with lcSSc (12% and 10%, respectively). In the
small subgroup with lSSc, only 1 death was observed during
the study period. 
Chart review showed a higher frequency of ILD, PH
associated with ILD (PH-ILD), and PAH in the 43 patients
who died during the study period than in the surviving
patients (Figure 1). Indeed, univariate analyses identified
ILD and PH (PAH and PH-ILD) as factors associated with
mortality (Table 2). Male sex and the dcSSc subtype were
also factors associated with a poor prognosis, whereas ACA
was negatively associated with mortality (Table 2). The
multivariate logistic regression analysis using a manual
backward elimination procedure showed that PAH (OR 8.0,
95% CI 3.4–18.8) followed by ILD (OR 3.1, 95% CI
1.5–6.6) were the strongest predictors for mortality.
Standardized mortality ratios. During the observation
period, the mortality rate in the patients was 14%, while it
was 7% in the age- and sex-matched control group (i.e., 317
deaths in 4680 controls). Thus, the overall SMR of the
observation period was 2.03. The all-cause SMR was higher
in men than in women; SMR for dcSSc was 5.33 compared
to 1.62 for lcSSc (Table 3). We also calculated the overall
SMR of the followup period separately and found that this
was 2.00 (95% CI 1.4–2.7), i.e., not different from the SMR
of the total observation period. 
Survival rates. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative 5-year overall
survival for patients with SSc was 95%, and the 10-year
survival was estimated to be 86% (Figure 2a). The 5- and
10-year survival rates for lcSSc were estimated to be 98% and
93%, and 91% and 70% for dcSSc, respectively (Figure 2b). 
Causes of death. Chart review and review of death certifi￾cates suggested that the death was attributable to SSc in 24
of the 43 deceased patients (Table 4). Of the remaining 19
patients, 16 had causes of death not attributable to the
disease and 3 died sudden deaths that, according to the death
certificates, had unknown causes. Review of the medical
charts of these 3 patients, all having clinically stable SSc,
did not provide any further information on the causes of
death. 
In total, 56% of the SSc-attributable deaths were due to
cardiopulmonary diseases, with pulmonary fibrosis (20%)
and PAH/PH (20%) the most frequent causes (Table 4). All
5 patients dying of pulmonary fibrosis had extensive fibrosis
according to the staging system of Goh, et al38. All patients
dying of PAH/PH had precapillary PH; no signs of postcap￾illary PH were noted. 
Another 25% of the patients died of SSc-associated
gastrointestinal causes, such as bleeding, aspiration,
cachexia, and malabsorption. Renal causes accounted for
the death of 5 patients (20%). Three of the 5 patients with
renal failure were diagnosed with SRC during their disease

course (12.5% of SSc-related deaths). They all died within 3
years after their SRC diagnosis. 
The 16 cases with non-SSc-related causes of death
included malignancies (n = 6), infections (n = 2), coronary
arterial disease (n = 2), obstructive lung diseases (n = 2),
stroke (n = 2), and bleeding anemia (n = 2; Table 4). 
Statistics Norway provided data on the causes of death of
the control group, as stated on their death certificates. The
most common causes of death in the controls were malig￾nancies (45%), cardiovascular disease (20%), stroke (11%),
infections (6%), and obstructive lung disease (6%). No
comparison of the causes of death between patients with
SSc and controls was performed. 
DISCUSSION
Data on the survival and causes of death in unselected SSc
cohorts are limited. We followed 312 patients with SSc over
an 11-year period and compared the mortality in this SSc
cohort with age- and sex-matched controls from the
Norwegian background population. Our results reinforce the
view that SSc is a disease with increased mortality and that
male sex, dcSSc, and cardiopulmonary diseases are factors
associated with a poor prognosis. 
Both the observed SMR of 2.03 and the 5- and 10-year
survival rates of 95% and 86% indicate that the mortality of
SSc in southeast Norway is lower than reported in most
other countries8,10,14,15,17,19,21,39. We tentatively suggest,
however, that the relatively low mortality reflects that the
current cohort is unselected and therefore includes propor￾tionally more patients with mild and early disease than
cohorts from referral centers. In accord with the recent
metaanalysis by Komocsi, et al30, we observed that males
and patients with dcSSc had the worst outcome. 
Since previous mortality studies have not included the
lSSc subset, this subgroup was excluded from the mortality

rate analyses. Although the mortality in the lSSc group was
very low (only 1/35 patients died), the inclusion of this
subgroup would have influenced the total SMR only
slightly. 
In our study, 56% of deaths were related to SSc. This
frequency of SSc-attributable deaths and the distribution of
SSc-related causes of mortality are comparable to figures
reported from the European League Against Rheumatism
Scleroderma Trials and Research group database, Elhai and
Komocsi and their coworkers’ metaanalyses, and
others12,19,20,22,30,31. However, we report a lower frequency
of death caused by cardiovascular disease and malignancies
than some other studies10,13,14,22,27,39. This might be due to
the unselected design of this cohort, different interpretations
of causes of death, or other causes, including genetic or
environmental variations. SRC accounted for 12% of the
SSc-related deaths; this is in the same range as recent data
from Brazil and supports the results of Steen and Medsger
showing decreasing frequency of SRC as an SSc-related
cause of death19,27. Interestingly, we did not identify any
deaths caused by arrhythmia, but cannot exclude the possi￾bility that this was the cause in the 3 patients with sudden
deaths.
The selection of the initial timepoint from which survival
was estimated could have affected the survival results. Like
Bryan, et al39 we used the first non-RP symptom as the
initial timepoint when estimating disease duration.
However, this might lead to higher survival for patients than

for the controls. Further, our results using non-RP symptom
as the initial timepoint may be difficult to compare with those
preferring diagnosis as the start of the followup11,13,14,15,16,19.
Therefore, we additionally estimated the overall SMR from
the time of diagnosis, which yielded an SMR of 2.00 versus
2.03 using time of first non-RP symptom. Notably, the
choice of the initial timepoint did not significantly affect the
SMR. Only 10 (3%) of the 317 deaths observed in the 4680
age- and sex-matched controls occurred during the
diagnostic delay period; this mainly explains the lack of
difference. The rather long followup period is another
partial explanation.
This study has some major strengths. First and probably
most important is that our study provides reliable mortality
data on an SSc cohort with unselected patients. It is, in fact,
the only mortality study from Northern Europe with
unselected patients10,14,39. Second, we believe that the
robust acquisition strategy enabled us to enroll (almost) all
the patients with SSc in the study area and to establish a
complete SSc cohort. Third, the composition of the SSc
cohort, with 75% women and about 25% patients with
dcSSc, is similar to population-based cohorts, but different
from the selected cohorts reported in the majority of
mortality studies40. Fourth, because of the unique identifi￾cation numbers in Norway and the official mortality
statistics, no patients were lost to followup. Finally, to our
knowledge the study is the first SSc mortality investigation
that has used age- and sex-matched controls instead of
life-table analyses to determine SMR.
The most important limitation of our study is probably
the “immortality bias,” which was unavoidable given the
study design41. This bias potentially leads to an underesti￾mation of the true mortality and is caused by the inclusion
of longtime survivors in the study population (i.e., patients
who were diagnosed before 1999 and survived throughout
the whole study period). We did, however, find that the
SMR in the patient subgroup diagnosed before 1999 (n =
118) was only slightly lower than the SMR of the entire
cohort (1.7 vs 2.0). This argues that the immortality bias had
no major influence on the results. Another potential
limitation is the retrospective design. All data on the causes
of death relied on medical records, which frequently lack
documentation, and death certificates, which may also lack
critical information. Finally, because we assessed the
mortality rate of SSc in a rather homogeneous population of
white descent, our results are not necessarily comparable to
data from other populations. 
Our data show that mortality in SSc remains high, partic￾ularly in the subset of patients with dcSSc and male sex. The
major causes of death were PH and lung fibrosis.
