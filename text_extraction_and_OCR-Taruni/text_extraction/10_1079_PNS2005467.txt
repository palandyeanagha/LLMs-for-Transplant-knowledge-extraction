and mechanism of action

Se is an unusual trace element in having its own codon in mRNA that specifies its insertion into
selenoproteins as selenocysteine (SeCys), by means of a mechanism requiring a large SeCys￾insertion complex. This exacting insertion machinery for selenoprotein production has impli￾cations for the Se requirements for cancer prevention. If Se may protect against cancer, an
adequate intake of Se is desirable. However, the level of intake in Europe and some parts of the
world is not adequate for full expression of protective selenoproteins. The evidence for Se as a
cancer preventive agent includes that from geographic, animal, prospective and intervention
studies. Newly-published prospective studies on oesophageal, gastric-cardia and lung cancer
have reinforced previous evidence, which is particularly strong for prostate cancer. Interven￾tions with Se have shown benefit in reducing the risk of cancer incidence and mortality in all
cancers combined, and specifically in liver, prostate, colo-rectal and lung cancers. The effect
seems to be strongest in those individuals with the lowest Se status. As the level of Se that
appears to be required for optimal effect is higher than that previously understood to be
required to maximise the activity of selenoenzymes, the question has been raised as to whether
selenoproteins are involved in the anti-cancer process. However, recent evidence showing an
association between Se, reduction of DNA damage and oxidative stress together with data
showing an effect of selenoprotein genotype on cancer risk implies that selenoproteins are
indeed implicated. The likelihood of simultaneous and consecutive effects at different cancer
stages still allows an important role for anti-cancer Se metabolites such as methyl selenol
formed from g-glutamyl-selenomethyl-SeCys and selenomethyl-SeCys, components identified
in certain plants and Se-enriched yeast that have anti-cancer effects. There is some evidence
that Se may affect not only cancer risk but also progression and metastasis. Current primary
and secondary prevention trials of Se are underway in the USA, including the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) relating to prostate cancer, although a large
European trial is still desirable given the likelihood of a stronger effect in populations of lower
Se status.
Selenium: Cancer: Mechanism: Selenomethyl-selenocysteine: Selenoprotein
single-nucleotide polymorphism
Se is an essential trace element like no other. Its unique
redox chemistry has been exploited by biological systems
since the advent of dioxygen in the earth’s environment
created a requirement for a two-electron detoxification
system for dealing with peroxides (Frausto da Silva &
Williams, 2001). Its crucial role is underlined by the fact
that it is the only trace element to be specified in the
genetic code (RJP Williams, personal communication),
as selenocysteine (SeCys; the 21st amino acid), which
when incorporated into selenoproteins, protects tissues
and membranes from oxidative stress and controls cell
redox status (Rayman, 2000). As will be seen later, SeCys
is ‘dramatically different from the other twenty amino
acids in the mode of its incorporation and basic biosyn￾thetic steps’ (Hatfield & Gladyshev, 2002) and this
complex insertion machinery for selenoprotein production
has implications for the Se requirements for cancer
prevention.

Evidence is accruing, some of which will be presented,
that the level of intake of Se affects the risk of cancer and
may even inhibit its spread from a primary tumour. Since
UK deaths from cancer in adults now outnumber deaths
from IHD and stroke, and approximately one in three of
the European population will be diagnosed with cancer
during their lifetime (CancerStats, 2004a,b), it is timely to
consider the potential of Se for cancer reduction.
The nature of the Se species involved in anti-cancer
processes is still a matter of speculation and much ongoing
experimental work. Whether the selenoproteins are crucial
to the anti-cancer effects requires some understanding of
the biosynthetic machinery involved and of the function
of some of the selenoproteins most likely to be relevant to
cancer. These issues will be addressed.
Selenoproteins
Biosynthesis
Unlike the other twenty amino acids, SeCys is biosynthe￾sised on its own tRNA, Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, from selenophos￾phate as the Se source. Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec has many unusual
features, including its long length (Hatfield & Gladyshev,
2002). The insertion of SeCys is specified by the UGA
codon in mRNA. However, as UGA is also a stop codon
the presence of a stem–loop structure in mRNA, a SeCys
insertion sequence (SECIS) element, downstream from
UGA in the 30
-mRNA-untranslated region is also required
for UGA to be read as SeCys. SECIS elements function by
recruiting additional factors, including the SECIS-binding
protein, the SeCys-specific elongation factor and Sec
tRNA[Ser]Sec, to form the large SeCys insertion complex
required for the synthesis of selenoproteins and known as
the selenosome (Berry et al. 1991, 1993; Hatfield &
Gladyshev, 2002). The human selenoproteome consists of
twenty-five selenoproteins (Kryukov et al. 2003).
Some selenoproteins of particular relevance to cancer
The functions of many of the twenty-five human seleno￾proteins are as yet unknown, although they generally par￾ticipate in antioxidant and anabolic processes (Hatfield &
Gladyshev, 2002). Selenoproteins that may be relevant to
cancer risk are described in Table 1 and include a number
from the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family, the 15 kDa
selenoprotein (Sep15), selenoprotein P and the thioredoxin
reductases, although a beneficial role of the thioredoxin
reductases in cancer prevention is doubtful.
Selenium intakes and status of adults in
different countries
If Se may protect against cancer, an adequate intake of
Se is desirable. Whether the intake of Se is adequate is,
however, questionable in much of Europe and some other
parts of the world. Mean intake levels in a number of
countries (Combs, 2001; Rayman, 2004) are shown in
Fig. 1, which also indicates the range of Se intake believed
to be required for optimal activity of plasma GPx
(Thomson et al. 1993; Duffield et al. 1999). It is clear that
the level of intake in Europe and some parts of China is not
adequate for full expression of GPx. (According to Combs
(2001), the same may be true of other parts of the world, as
there is little or no information on Se intake or status for
most of Africa, South America and central and south Asia.)
Furthermore, an updated study of Se requirements by
Burk’s group in collaboration with Chinese colleagues
(Xia et al. 2005) has shown that full expression of sele￾noprotein P requires a greater Se intake than that required

for full expression of plasma GPx. Thus, it is even more
likely that current intakes are inadequate for optimising the
protective effects of the selenoproteins. Indeed, there is
evidence that will be outlined that suggests that levels of
Se intake that are supra-nutritional may be required to
reduce cancer risk (Combs, 2001; Rayman, 2002).
Evidence for an effect of selenium on cancer risk
The evidence for Se as a cancer preventive agent has been
reviewed ably by a number of researchers (for example,
see Combs & Grey, 1998; Ip, 1998; Combs & Lu¨, 2001;
Knekt, 2002; Whanger, 2004; Combs, 2005), and includes
findings from in vitro, animal, geographic (ecological) and
prospective studies, and from interventions with Se. Such
evidence will be summarised and updated, although
in vitro studies and studies on Se compounds that cannot
arise from food sources will only be referred to briefly (for
more detail, see Combs & Grey, 1998; Ip, 1998; Combs &
Lu¨, 2001; Knekt, 2002; Whanger, 2004; Combs, 2005).
Case–control studies will be excluded as it is not possible
to distinguish between Se concentration as an indicator of
cancer risk and Se concentration that is a consequence of
the disease process (Overvad, 1998).
Animal studies
Extensive experimental evidence indicates that Se supple￾mentation reduces the incidence of cancer in animals
(Medina & Morrison, 1988; Combs & Gray, 1998; Combs
& Lu¨, 2001). However, it is difficult to generalise from
such studies and extrapolate to the human situation, as
animal studies have generally used doses at least ten times
greater than those required to prevent clinical signs of
deficiency, which, on a per unit body-weight basis, are
considerably higher than most human Se intakes. However,
it is worth describing a supplementation study on male
beagle dogs, a species that develops spontaneous prostate
cancer, as the lower dose given is reasonable for man.
Supplementation of the diet of sexually-intact elderly male
dogs with Se, as selenomethionine or high-Se yeast, at 3 or
6 mg/kg body weight per d for 7 months was found to
reduce DNA damage and up-regulate epithelial cell apop￾tosis in their prostates, while no such effects were seen in
the dogs that were not supplemented (Waters et al. 2003).
It appears that Se sensitises prostate epithelial cells so that
cells with extensive DNA damage undergo apoptosis
in vivo.
Geographical (ecological) studies
Since as early as the 1960s geographical studies have
shown a consistent trend for populations with low Se
intakes to have higher cancer mortality rates (Shamberger
& Frost, 1969; Schrauzer et al. 1977; Clark et al. 1991). In
one such study (Schrauzer et al. 1977), inverse correlations
were observed between apparent dietary Se intakes esti￾mated from food-consumption data in twenty-seven

countries and age-corrected mortality for a number of
cancers, including that of the prostate. However, the value
of evidence from this type of study is not rated very highly
by epidemiologists.
Prospective and nested case–control studies
Knekt (2002) has tabulated the results of prospective
studies of Se and cancer published up to the end of 1998.
The following categories are included: all cancers; lung
cancer; colo-rectal, gastrointestinal and stomach cancers;
prostate cancer; female cancers; miscellaneous cancers that
include cancers of the liver, bladder, mouth, pharynx,
oesophagus and malignant melanoma. Of approximately
seventy-two table entries, fifty entries show a lower risk
associated with higher Se intake or status, although only
in eighteen studies (25%) that included all cancers and
cancers of the bladder, lung, ovary, prostate, stomach and
thyroid is the risk significantly reduced.
More recent evidence that Se status can influence
mortality from all cancers combined has been found in a
cohort of 1389 male and female volunteers recruited in the
Etude du Vieillissement Arte´riel (Akbaraly et al. 2005).
Mean baseline plasma Se levels in the cohort were reported
to be 86 mg/l, which is similar to levels in much of Europe.
During the 9-year follow-up, 101 subjects died, fifty-five of
them from cancer. The risk of mortality from cancer was
shown to be increased fourfold in subjects in the bottom
quartile of baseline plasma Se compared with those in the
top quartile (relative risk (RR) 4.
06 (95% CI 1.
51, 10.
92);
P = 0.
006).
The strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of Se from
prospective studies appears to relate to lung cancer,
oesophageal and gastric-cardia cancers and, most notably,
prostate cancer. The risk of colo-rectal adenoma, a pre￾cancerous condition, also seems to be affected.
Lung cancer. A recent meta-analysis of existing
epidemiological evidence from sixteen studies has shown
a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer (summary
RR 0.
74) associated with higher Se exposure (Zhuo et al.
2004; Table 3). The effects were found to occur primarily
in populations of low Se exposure (defined as serum Se
<100 mg/l or intake <55 mg/d). In studies carried out in
high-Se areas (defined as serum Se >100 mg/l or intake
>55 mg/d) protective effects appeared on moving from the
lowest Se category to the second-lowest Se category, but
increasing Se exposure thereafter appeared to have little
further effect, suggesting the existence of a threshold
effect.
Oesophageal cancer and gastric-cardia cancer. In a
nested study from the Nutrition Intervention Trial in
Linxian, China, significant inverse associations were found
between baseline serum Se concentration as a continuous
variable and death from oesophageal squamous cell carci￾noma (RR 0.
83 (95% CI 0.
71, 0.
98)) and gastric-cardia
cancer [RR 0.
75 (95% CI 0.
59, 0.
95)] in 1103 subjects
randomly-selected from the larger trial cohort and followed
for 15 years (Wei et al. 2004). When the subjects were
classified by quartile of baseline Se, those in the highest
quartile had a 65% significant reduction in the risk of death
from oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (RR 0.
35
(95% CI 0.
16, 0.
81)) and a 69% significant reduction in
the risk of death from gastric-cardia cancer (RR 0.
31 (95%
CI 0.
11, 0.
87)) when compared with the subjects in the
lowest quartile. The mean population serum Se concentra￾tion in the cohort (73 mg/l) was relatively low. It has been
suggested by Wei et al. (2004) that population-wide Se
supplementation in regions of China with low serum
Se levels and high rates of these cancers merits serious
consideration.
Prostate cancer. Results from large prospective
studies of prostate cancer (Knekt et al. 1990; Yoshizawa
et al. 1998; Helzlsouer et al. 2000; Nomura et al. 2000;
Brooks et al. 2001; Goodman et al. 2001; van den Brandt
et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004) are shown in Table 2. Those
published in 2003 and 2004 were large studies with 540
(van den Brandt et al. 2003) and 586 (Li et al. 2004) cases.
Of the eight prospective studies listed seven show a
reduced risk of prostate cancer overall for the highest
v. lowest category of Se status, the risk being significantly
reduced in five studies. When the analysis is confined to
subjects who had advanced prostate cancer or a baseline
prostate-specific antigen of >4 ng/ml, six of the eight
prospective studies show a significant reduction in
prostate cancer in the subjects in the highest category of
Se status.
Although the study of Knekt et al. (1990) in Finland
showed no relationship between serum Se concentration
and prostate cancer risk, Platz & Helzlsouer (2001) have
noted that the participants had circulating levels almost
three times lower than those reported in the other studies
(approximately 50 mg/l v. 150 mg/l). Thus, it may be pos￾sible that the concentration of Se in this cohort was below
the threshold at which Se can exert a protective effect on
prostate cancer risk. This possibility is given credence by
the study of Nomura et al. (2000), which has shown that
there is a protective effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.
5) mainly in
subjects with serum Se concentrations >147 mg/l, with an
OR of approximately 1 in lower quartiles of plasma Se.
In a number of these studies (Yoshizawa et al. 1998;
Nomura et al. 2000; van den Brandt et al. 2003; Li et al.
2004) the protective effect of Se has been shown to be
stronger for advanced prostate cancer, i.e. disease that has
spread beyond the prostate, than for localised disease.
Furthermore, when data from the Physicians’ Health Study
were analysed according to baseline prostate-specific anti￾gen level, the protective effect was found to be significant
for all prostate cancers (both localised and advanced
disease) but only in those with baseline prostate specific
antigen >4 ng/ml (Li et al. 2004), again suggesting a major
effect of Se on prostate cancer progression rather than
initiation.
Two studies have suggested that smoking modifies the
effect of Se. The Netherlands Cohort Study has shown by
far the strongest effect of Se in ex-smokers (van den
Brandt et al. 2003), while the inverse association between
Se and prostate cancer was found to be mainly present in
current or past cigarette smokers in the study of Nomura
et al. (2000).
Colo-rectal adenoma. Colo-rectal adenoma is closely
associated with subsequent development of colo-rectal
cancer (Weingarten et al. 2005). Jacobs et al. (2004) have
530 M. P. Rayman
https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2005467 Published online by Cambridge University Press

carried out a pooled analysis of data from three studies that
could be considered as prospective studies of Se and risk
of colo-rectal adenoma. The Wheat Bran Fiber Trial
(Alberts et al. 2000), the Polyp Prevention Trial (Schatzkin
et al. 2000) and the Polyp Prevention Study (Greenberg
et al. 1994) were 3–4-year interventions in subjects that
had recently undergone adenoma removal, 1763 of whom
had baseline serum or plasma Se levels measured. The risk
of adenoma recurrence was not affected by any of the
interventions. Analysis of pooled data showed that the
subjects with baseline serum or plasma Se in the highest
quartile (median 150 mg/l), when compared with those in
the lowest quartile (median 113 mg/l), had a significantly
lower risk of adenoma recurrence (OR 0.
66 (95% CI 0.
50,
0.
87). These results support previous findings that are
suggestive of a beneficial effect of higher Se status on
colo-rectal cancer risk (Jacobs et al. 2004).
Intervention studies including randomised controlled trials
Chinese trials. National Cancer Institute-sponsored
trials in China for the prevention of oesophageal and
gastric cancer have observed a reduction in total cancer
mortality and a reduced incidence of oesophageal and
gastric-cardia cancers in the intervention arm comprising
Se, b-carotene and vitamin E (Blot et al. 1993; Mark et al.
2000). Although Se was not a single agent in these trials, it
is likely to have been the most effective component,
particularly in the light of subsequent studies (Wei et al.
2004). (As one of a number of agents in an Indian trial Se
has also been shown to aid the remission of precancerous
lesions of the oral cavity (Krishnaswamy et al. 1995;
Prasad et al. 1995).)
Hepatocellular carcinoma is highly prevalent in
China. In Qidong county, near Shanghai, its incidence is

particularly high. In this region approximately 15% of
adults carry the hepatitis B surface antigen and these
individuals are 200 times more likely to develop hepato￾cellular carcinoma. In a study in which 226 hepatitis B
antigen carriers were randomised to a Se (200 mg)-enriched
yeast tablet or a placebo, no case of hepatocellular carci￾noma was reported to occur in the Se-supplemented group
after 4 years, while seven subjects in the unsupplemented
placebo group had developed hepatocellular carcinoma
(Yu et al. 1997). However, as full details of the metho￾dology of this study are not available, it is difficult to
assess whether its protocol was sufficiently well-controlled
or robust to be confident in its conclusions.
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of anti￾oxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal
cancers has assessed the evidence for an effect of Se
(Bjelakovic et al. 2004). Data from three Chinese trials
were included, two of which used selenised yeast (Yu et al.
1997), while the third trial used Na2SeO3 (Li et al. 2000).
Bjelakovic et al. (2004) concluded that, in contrast to other
antioxidant nutrients, Se showed a significant beneficial
effect, reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by
50% (RR 0.
50 (95% CI 0.
35, 0.
71)).
The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial and
follow-up analyses. The strongest evidence of the
efficacy of Se as an anti-cancer agent, particularly for
prostate cancer, is provided by the Nutritional Prevention
of Cancer (NPC) trial, carried out by Clark and co-workers
(Clark et al. 1996, 1998; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002,
2003a,b). Subjects (n 1312) with a history of non￾melanoma skin cancer were randomised to placebo or
200 mg Se (as Se-enriched yeast)/d. After 4.
5 years of
treatment and 6.
5 years of follow-up no effect was found
on the primary end point of non-melanoma skin cancer.
However, in those subjects receiving Se, significant
secondary end-point effects of 50% lower total cancer
mortality and 37% lower total cancer incidence were
found, with fewer prostate, colo–rectal and lung cancers
(Table 4). Follow-up analyses to the end of the blinded
treatment period, a further 25 months, showed a reduced
effect on total cancer, but while the protective effect on
prostate cancer was maintained there was no longer a
protective effect on lung and colo-rectal cancers (Duffield￾Lillico et al. 2002; Table 4).
Although the initial finding that Se supplementation
was not significantly associated with the incidence of
basal-cell carcinoma (Cox proportional hazards model;
hazard ratio (HR) 1.
09 (95% CI 0.
94, 1.
26)) was confirmed
in the follow-up analyses, the elevated risk of squamous￾cell carcinoma and total non-melanoma skin cancer was
raised by the extended period of treatment to significant
levels (HR 1.
25 (95% CI 1.
03, 1.
51) and 1.
17 (95% CI
1.
02, 1.
34) respectively; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2003b).
However, there are a number of reassuring factors that are
relevant here: first, when a treatment lag of 2 years
following randomisation was introduced, thus excluding
lesions already in the course of development, the sig￾nificant effect disappeared; second, when subjects were
divided into tertiles according to baseline Se status, those
in the bottom tertile (see earlier discussion), whose status
resembled that found in Europe, did not have an increased
risk of squamous-cell carcinoma (HR 0.
87 (95% CI 0.
62,
1.
22)). Finally, it must be remembered that the subjects in
the NPC trial were all patients with skin cancer whose skin
had sustained heavy sun damage (Duffield-Lillico et al.
2003b).
The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial subgroup
analyses. The protective effect of Se was found to be
confined to men, both in the initial and follow-up analyses,
although the fact that there were many fewer women than
men (319 v. 931) must be taken into consideration (Clark
et al. 1996; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002). As seen in some
of the prospective studies discussed earlier, the protective
effect of Se was found to be stronger in former smokers
(Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002).
Analysis of treatment effect by initial plasma Se status
in the NPC trial has shown that the strongest treatment
effect was in subjects in the lowest tertile of plasma Se at
baseline, i.e. those subjects whose plasma Se concentration
was <106 mg/l at entry to the trial (Duffield-Lillico et al.
2002). Se supplementation was found to reduce total
cancer incidence in this tertile by 49% (HR 0.
51 (95% CI
0.
32, 0.
81)) (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002) and prostate
cancer incidence by 86% (HR 0.
14 (95% CI 0.
03, 0.
61);
Duffield-Lillico et al. 2003a) in the follow-up analyses.
Most UK and European populations would fall into this
tertile.
A significant interaction between baseline plasma Se and
treatment was detected such that those subjects in the top
tertile (>121.
6 mg/l) that were supplemented with Se had a
significantly increased risk of total cancer (HR 1.
88 (95%

Although this is a subgroup analysis of a secondary end￾point analysis and must therefore be regarded with caution,
it does raise queries about the advisability of supplement￾ing individuals of already-adequate status (e.g. ‡120 mg/l)
with Se.
Insights from the evidence presented
What lessons can be learned from the NPC trial? It would
appear that plasma Se should reach approximately 120 mg/l
to optimise the anti-cancer effect of Se. This level is higher
than that previously understood to be required to maximise
the activity or concentration of selenoenzymes such as GPx
(Thomson et al. 1993; Duffield et al. 1999), although ideas
for optimum levels have recently had to be revised
upwards as a result of new findings on requirements for
selenoprotein P (Xia et al. 2005). Does this outcome mean
that the selenoenzymes are not relevant to the anti-cancer
effects of Se, or do some individuals have a higher Se
requirement, perhaps as a result of single-nucleotide poly￾morphisms (SNPs) in their selenoprotein genes? This
issue will be addressed as part of a general consideration
of possible mechanisms by which Se may reduce cancer
risk.
Selenium anti-cancer mechanisms
A number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain
the anti-cancer effects of Se. These are summarised in
Table 5. Although there is fairly general acceptance that
methyl selenol (CH3SeH) is involved in the anti-cancer
effects of Se at supra-nutritional doses, as will be
explained below, evidence is accruing, some from effects
of functional selenoprotein polymorphisms, that the seleno￾enzymes do play a role, particularly at nutritional levels of
intake. Se in selenoproteins can reduce oxidative stress and
limit DNA damage, both of which have been linked to
cancer risk. Some of these anti-cancer processes or path￾ways are discussed more fully later (p. 536).
Methyl selenol and its precursors
The in vivo production of small-molecular-weight Se
metabolites such as CH3SeH that have potent anti-cancer
properties has been inferred from work carried out by a
number of research groups (Ip, 1998; Jiang et al. 1999; Ip
et al. 2000, 2002; Davis & Finley, 2003; Spallholz et al.
2004; Whanger, 2004). The metabolism of dietary forms
of Se is shown in Fig. 2 (adapted from Combs, 2001;
Rayman, 2004), from which it can be seen that CH3SeH
can be formed by the methylation of H2Se as part of the Se
excretory pathway. There is also some evidence that
CH3SeH can be formed directly from selenomethionine
either by the action of a g-lyase, also known as methioni￾nase (Nakamuro et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2002; Spallholz
et al. 2004) or by an a, g-elimination reaction (Okuno
et al. 2005). Alternatively, it can be formed from a storage
form of Se, i.e. g-glutamyl-selenomethyl (SeMe)-SeCys,
that is present in plants of the Brassica and Allium families
(Ip et al. 2000; Kotrebai et al. 2000; Whanger, 2004)
and probably accounts for the anti-tumour effects of
Se-enriched broccoli and garlic (Ip et al. 2000; Davis &
Finlay, 2003). Metabolism removes the g-glutamyl group
to give SeMe-SeCys, which is acted upon by a b-lyase to
give CH3SeH directly (Ip et al. 2000; Combs, 2001). There
is a suggestion that the b-lyase is present at a higher level
in cancer cells than in normal cells, ensuring greater
exposure of the tumour cells to the anti-cancer agent
(Spallholz et al. 2004).
Speciation studies have been carried out on Se-enriched
yeast, the form of Se shown to be effective in most human
interventions. These studies have shown the presence of
small amounts of both g-glutamyl-SeMe-SeCys and SeMe￾SeCys, dependent on the method of extraction, inferring
that CH3SeH may be produced directly from the Se￾enriched yeast without the necessity of conversion from
selenomethionine, its major Se constituent (Goenaga
Infante et al. 2004, 2005). As SeMe-SeCys has been found
to be more than twice as effective as selenomethionine in
reducing mammary tumours in rats (Whanger, 2004), even
these small amounts may be important.
Precursors of CH3SeH, typically methyl seleninic acid
(CH3SeO2H) in experimental in vitro systems, have been
shown to block progression of the cell cycle, induce
apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit the formation of new
blood vessels, without which tumours cannot grow or
metastasise (Ip, 1998; Jiang et al. 1999; Ip et al. 2000;
Davis & Finley, 2003; Whanger, 2004). Processes by
which these effects are achieved may involve redox
cycling linked to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, as
described by Spallholz et al. (2004), and include changes
in the expression of genes that control the cell-cycle
checkpoint and regulate signalling pathways and caspase￾mediated apoptosis (Dong et al. 2003). For instance,
SeMe-SeCys activates caspase-3 in mouse mammary
epithelial tumour cells in vitro (Unni et al. 2001) while
CH3SeO2H is known to activate initiator caspases-1, 8, 10,
and 12 (Zu & Ip, 2003). Apoptosis induced by CH3SeO2H
in DU-145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells is
principally initiated by caspase-8 and involves cell
detachment as a prerequisite (Jiang et al. 2001; Zu & Ip,
2003). Caspase-12, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident
caspase essential for endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced
apoptosis, is also activated during apoptosis induced by
CH3SeO2H in PC-3 cells, suggesting a possible role for
endoplasmic reticulum stress in apoptosis induced by
CH3SeH (Zu & Ip, 2003).
Reduction of DNA damage
Evidence that Se can reduce DNA damage comes from
studies in dogs and man. In a canine model of prostate
cancer forty-nine elderly male beagle dogs, physiologically
equivalent to 62–69-year-old men and similarly subject to
prostate cancer, received nutritionally-adequate or supra￾nutritional levels of dietary Se as selenomethionine or
Se-enriched yeast for 7 months (Waters et al. 2005). DNA
damage in the prostate was measured by the alkaline comet
assay while Se was measured in toenails. The percentage
of prostate cells with extensive DNA damage was found
to fall with increased Se exposure up to a level of

9 mg/g, as measured in dog toenails. Damage began
to rise at >1.
0 mg/g toenails, demonstrating the typical
‘U’-shaped response to a nutrient that is toxic at high
levels. Although the authors claim to have supplemented
the dogs over the range of intake seen in US men, the
baseline maintenance diet, at 0.
3 mg Se/g, gave an intake
in the control group of 6 mg/kg body weight, already
equivalent to a high human intake, i.e. 450 mg/d for a 75 kg
man. The highest supplement level was an additional 6 mg
Se/kg body weight, equivalent to a total daily intake of
900 mg/d for a 75 kg man. It is not surprising, therefore,
that the upward arm of the ‘U’-shaped response was
breached.
In a New Zealand study of men aged 50–75 years at risk
of prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen >4 ng/ml),
the comet assay was reported to show a significant
(P = 0.
02) inverse relationship with overall accumulated
DNA damage in blood leucocytes from subjects with
serum Se levels below the mean (Karunasinghe et al.
2004). As the mean serum Se was measured as 98 (SD 17)
mg/l, this finding suggests that serum levels >98 mg/l
are required for the prevention of DNA damage in New
Zealand men.
Women born with a BRCA1 mutation carry a lifetime
risk of breast cancer of 80% and a lifetime risk of ovarian
cancer of 40% (Kowalska et al. 2005). The BRCA1 gene
product is involved in maintaining the integrity of the
human genome and helps repair double-strand breaks.
When blood lymphocytes from BRCA1 carriers are
exposed to bleomycin, a known mutagen that induces
double-strand breaks, an increased frequency of chromo￾some breaks per cell occurs, i.e. 0.
58 in BRCA1 carriers v.
0.
39 in non-carriers (Kowalska et al. 2005). In thirty-two
female BRCA1 carriers supplemented with Se (276 mg as
Na2SeO3/d) for 1–3 months, the frequency of chromosome
breaks was found to be reduced from 0.
63 per cell
before supplementation with Se to 0.
40 per cell after sup￾plementation, bringing it to the level in non-carrier con￾trols. Thus, Se may have the potential to reduce breast
cancer risk in these women.
Reduction of oxidative stress
The modification of the anti-cancer effects of Se by other
antioxidant nutrients suggests that the ability of Se in
selenoproteins to reduce oxidative stress is relevant to its
anti-cancer effects. Thus, Se intake or status becomes more
important when the concentration of other antioxidants or
the activity of other antioxidant enzymes is low. The
strongest effect of Se on cancer risk has been shown
among those subjects with the lowest levels of dietary
antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids (Willett et al. 1983;
Salonen et al. 1985; Kok et al. 1987; Knekt et al. 1990;
van den Brandt et al. 1993, 2003; Yu et al. 1999), and
particularly at low a-tocopherol concentrations (Combs &
Gray, 1998). In the study of Yoshizawa et al. (1998),
summarised in Table 2, the inverse association between Se
status and advanced prostate cancer was found to be
slightly stronger after excluding men with an intake of
vitamin E >30 mg/d, mostly from supplementary sources
(OR 0.
29 v. 0.
35). Data, as yet unpublished, from the NPC
trial (M Reid, personal communication) show that the
effect of Se supplementation on prostate cancer risk only
reaches significance in subjects in the bottom half of
a-tocopherol status, i.e. plasma concentrations <21.
66 mM
(P = 0.
03 v. P = 0.
31 in the top half of a-tocopherol
status).
A further indication of a link between the antioxidant
capacity of Se and cancer risk is seen in the modification
of the Se-dependent risk by a polymorphism in Mn
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), the primary antioxidant
enzyme in mitochondria. MnSOD has an Ala/Val poly￾morphism at codon 16 in the mitochondrial targetting
sequence that affects the structure of the protein. The
relationship between prostate cancer, the MnSOD poly￾morphism and baseline plasma Se concentration has been
investigated in 567 cases and 764 controls nested within
the prospective Physicians’ Health Study (Li et al. 2005).
Although little overall association was found between
MnSOD polymorphism and prostate cancer risk, in men
with the Ala/Ala genotype high Se status (4th quartile v.

2) for total
and clinically-aggressive prostate cancer respectively; Li
et al. 2005). The interdependence of MnSOD, Se status
and prostate cancer risk implies a role for the antioxidant
selenoenzymes.
Evidence from selenoprotein genotype data for a role
of selenoproteins in cancer prevention
It had been thought that selenoenzymes were not involved
in anti-cancer mechanisms because the level of Se
supplementation that reduced cancer risk (200 mg/d) was
greater than the amount then believed to be needed to
optimise selenoenzyme activity (Combs & Gray, 1998).
However, it has recently become clear that optimal
expression of some selenoproteins, notably selenoprotein
P, requires a higher amount, as yet undetermined, of
dietary Se (Xia et al. 2005) and, furthermore, that a sub￾stantial number of individuals may have a higher require￾ment for Se for efficient synthesis of selenoproteins, as will
be explained later (p. 537).
Individuals differ substantially in their ability to increase
selenoprotein activity in response to additional dietary Se
(Brown et al. 2000). This inter-individual variation in
selenoprotein expression levels may be accounted for by
SNPs in selenoprotein genes that determine the efficiency
with which individuals can incorporate Se into selenopro￾teins (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000; Ratnasinghe et al. 2000;
Hu et al. 2001; Hu & Diamond, 2003). Thus, requirements
for dietary Se for optimal protection against cancer may be
much higher in individuals carrying particular functional
selenoprotein SNPs such as those that will be described.
Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase. Recent studies have
reported a link between cancer risk and polymorphisms in
the cytosolic GPx selenoprotein (GPx1) gene at Pro198-
Leu. Possession of the Leu198 allele has been found to be
associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in
Caucasians but not among ethnic Chinese, who do not
appear to show this polymorphism (Ratnasinghe et al.
2000). Possession of the Leu198 allele also confers an
increased risk of bladder cancer (see Table 6) and that risk
is further raised in men who have one or two Ala alleles at
codon 9 (apparently identical to codon 16, as described
earlier) in exon 2 of MnSOD (Ichimura et al. 2004). In the
213 patients with bladder cancer, when compared with the
Pro/Pro genotype, the Pro/Leu genotype was found to be
significantly associated with advanced tumour stage
(OR 2.
58 (95% CI 1.
07, 6.
18); P = 0.
034 for tumour stage
T2–4 v. tumour stage Ta+1; Ichimura et al. 2004). By
contrast, in a case–control study of 399 cases of incident
invasive breast cancer and 372 controls, no association
between breast cancer and GPx1 Pro198Leu was found
(Knight et al. 2004). However, the allele of GPx1 con￾taining four GCG repeats was found to be significantly
associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal
women (OR 1.
55 (95% CI 1.
04, 2.
30) for carriers v. non￾carriers). Importantly, GPx1 with the Leu allele has been
shown to be less responsive to stimulation of its enzyme
activity by Se supplementation than GPx1 with the Pro
allele (Hu & Diamond, 2003).
Studies showing selective loss of the Pro198 allele of the
GPx1 gene during tumour development, as detected by loss
of heterozygosity at this locus, implicate GPx1 in the risk
and development of tumours. The Leu/Leu genotype has
been found to be almost twice as common in DNA from
breast cancer tissue as it is in DNA from cancer-free
individuals, while the Pro/Leu genotype was found to be
underrepresented, indicating loss of heterozygosity at this
locus in breast tumour development (Hu & Diamond,
2003). Similarly, DNA samples from head and neck
tumours exhibit fewer heterozygotes and an increased
frequency of the Leu/Leu genotype compared with DNA
from the cancer-free population (Hu et al. 2004).
15 kDa selenoprotein. Sep15 is expressed at high
levels in normal liver and prostate but at reduced levels in
the corresponding malignant organs (Behne et al. 1997).
It is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, tightly com￾plexed to UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase,
an enzyme involved in the quality control of protein fold￾ing (Korotkov et al. 2001). (The location of Sep15 may be
of interest as some forms of Se appear to activate endo￾plasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis, as mentioned
earlier.) The Sep15 gene lies on chromosome 1p22.3 at a
locus commonly deleted or mutated in human cancers
(Kumaraswamy et al. 2000; Kryukov et al. 2003). Two
SNPs at positions 811 (C/T) and 1125 (G/A) that are in
strong allelic association have been studied in the 30
-UTR
of the Sep15 gene; G1125A lies within a functional SECIS
element (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). The T811/A1125
variant has been shown to be more effective in supporting
UGA read-through than the C811/G1125 variant, but less
responsive to the addition of Se to the culture medium
(Hu et al. 2001; Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). Thus, the
identity of the nucleotides at 811 and 1125 influences the
function of the Sep15 SECIS element in a Se-dependent

manner (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). Individuals posses￾sing one or other of these haplotypes may therefore differ
in the efficiency with which they can make Sep15 and in
how well they can use dietary Se.
The frequency of the T811/A1125 haplotype is 0.
25 in
Caucasians and 0.
57 in African Americans, who have a
higher incidence of prostate cancer (Hu et al. 2001). If
lower levels of the Sep15 gene product predispose cells to
malignant transformation in the human population, then
those individuals carrying a particular Sep15 gene poly￾morphism may be at a greater risk of cancer and might
require a higher Se intake for protection. Furthermore, a
difference was found among African Americans (but not
Caucasians) in allele frequencies in DNA from breast or
head and neck tumours compared with DNA from cancer￾free controls. The authors (Hu et al. 2001; Diwadkar￾Navsariwala & Diamond, 2004) suggest that this difference
is likely to be largely related to loss of heterozygosity at
the Sep15 locus.
Additional evidence for an effect of this polymorphism
on cancer risk comes from a study of Apostolou et al.
(2004), which has shown that the A1125 variant of Sep15
is less responsive to the apoptotic and growth-inhibitory
effects of Se than the G1125 variant. The Sep15 gene
was shown to be down-regulated in 60% of malignant￾mesothelioma cell lines and tumour specimens in this
study.
Phospholipid glutathione peroxidase. Phospholipid
GPx (Gpx4) decreases lipid hydroperoxide levels, and thus
inhibits the lipoxygenases that metabolise arachidonic
acid to generate intermediates that mediate signals for
increasing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Kim
& Milner, 2001). In particular, it inhibits 5-lipoxygenase
and reduces the production of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid, which is known to stimulate the proliferation of
prostate cancer cells (Ghosh & Myers, 1998). Inhibition of
5-lipoxygenase has been shown to trigger massive apop￾tosis in human prostate cancer cells (Ghosh & Myers,
1998). The C718 allele of the GPx4 T718C SNP, which is
close to the SECIS element in the 30
-UTR, has a frequency
of 0.
45 in Caucasians and is associated with increased
levels of lymphocyte 5-lipoxygenase total products
(Villette et al. 2002). Thus, this polymorphism has
functional consequences and may influence the production
of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and consequently the
proliferation or apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Villette
et al. 2002). Two genetic studies (Hsieh et al. 2001;
Wiklund et al. 2003) have shown linkage of the chromo￾some 19p13.
3 region that contains the GPx4 gene to
prostate cancer.
Selenoprotein P. SNPs have also been identified in
selenoprotein P, a selenoprotein believed to be involved
both in protection from reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species and in the transport of Se to tissues. Normally, the
selenoprotein P gene is highly expressed in prostatic
epithelium but it is down regulated in a subset of human
prostate tumours, mouse tumours and prostate carcinoma
cell lines (Calvo et al. 2002). Calvo et al. (2002) have
suggested that reduced selenoprotein P synthesis occurs in
a subset of patients resulting in loss of protection from
oxidative stress.
Likelihood of simultaneous and consecutive effects at
different cancer stages
Given the breadth of evidence for the involvement of
forms of Se in various anti-cancer processes, it is likely
that Se acts at a number of stages in cancer development
and by a number of different mechanisms that may operate
simultaneously, or consecutively, involving both small￾molecular-weight Se metabolites and selenoproteins.
Diwadkar-Navsariwala & Diamond (2004) have proposed
a model in which the likelihood of cancer development
is linked to reduced levels of one or more protective
selenoproteins resulting from (1) inadequate dietary Se
intake and/or (2) genetic polymorphisms that result in an
increased Se requirement for selenoprotein synthesis
and/or (3) allelic loss of one or two gene copies during
tumour development. It may even be that exposure to some
forms of Se provokes cellular stress, up-regulating protec￾tive response systems (such as glutathione-S-transferase)
that reduce cancer risk (V Gladyshev, personal communi￾cation). Clearly, this very complex area is far from being
fully understood.
Effect of selenium on progression and metastasis
There are a few indications that Se can have an effect on
cancer progression or metastasis. Three examples are: (1)
the effect of Se status on prostate cancer is greater for
advanced disease (disease that has spread beyond the
prostate) than for primary disease (Nomura et al. 2000;
van den Brandt et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004), suggesting
an inhibitory effect on tumour spread; (2) angiogenesis
is required for progression and metastasis. It requires
growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth
factor and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular
matrix by the family of matrix metalloproteinases.
Vascular endothelial growth factor expression and
protein levels are significantly lowered, as is the activity
of matrix metalloproteinases by CH3SeH precursors
(Jiang et al. 1999, 2000, 2004), while selenite inhibits
invasion of human fibrosarcoma cells by reducing the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (Yoon
et al. 2001); (3) the tumour stage of bladder cancer is
affected by GPx1 genotype, giving indirect evidence that
GPx1 is relevant to bladder cancer progression (Ichimura
et al. 2004).
Current and future selenium-cancer projects
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
(SELECT), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute at
a cost of US$180 · million, is a phase III randomised
double-blind placebo-controlled trial designed to test the
efficacy of Se (200 mg L-selenomethionine) and vitamin E
(400 mg DL-a-tocopherol), both alone and in combination,
in the prevention of prostate cancer (Klein, 2004). The
target accrual of 32 400 male volunteers has been achieved
and final results are expected in 2013.
The possibility of raising even one-tenth of the sum
made available in the USA for the Selenium and Vitamin E
Micronutrients through the life cycle 537
https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2005467 Published online by Cambridge University Press

Cancer Prevention Trial for a similar-scale trial in Europe
is remote. However, European investigators are still
hopeful that a sufficient sum can be raised to carry out a
less-expensive web-based trial (Prevention of Cancer by
Intervention with Selenium) with Se-enriched yeast in
Europe where Se intakes and status are so much lower.
As the strongest treatment effect in the NPC Trial has been
observed in subjects in the lowest tertile of plasma Se at
baseline (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002), Se intervention in
European subjects would greatly increase the chance of
seeing an effect. Equally importantly, it would eliminate
the possibility of adverse effects in individuals of already￾adequate Se status (‡ 120 mg/l) such as were seen in the
top tertile in the NPC Trial (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002).
Furthermore, women as well as men would be included in
the European trial.
Se-enriched yeast is currently being used in further
prostate cancer studies at the Arizona Cancer Center
at doses of 200–800 mg/d, i.e. the Negative Biopsy
Trial (Stratton et al. 2003a), the Preprostatectomy Trial
(Marshall, 2001) and the Watchful Waiting Trial (Stratton
et al. 2003b).
There has not yet been a human trial with SeMe-SeCys,
although preparation for such a study in human subjects
by Ip and colleagues is apparently underway (M Reid,
personal communication). As SeMe-SeCys is not a very
good precursor for selenoproteins, the results of such a
study would be very informative.
The present author and colleagues are investigating the
effect of functional selenoprotein SNPs on prostate cancer
risk using DNA samples from 1400 prostate cancer
cases and 800 age- and location-matched controls from
the Swedish prostate cancer study (Wiklund et al. 2003).
Careful speciation work (Goenaga-Infante et al. 2004,
2005) is also being extended to identify low-molecular￾weight Se species in body tissues and fluids and in
Se-enriched yeast and plants.
Will industry allow us to find the definitive answer?
Much time has elapsed during which scientists have spent
increasing amounts of time and effort in fund-raising for
demanding and meticulous studies to clarify whether Se
truly has an effect in reducing cancer risk. Industry has
already made up its mind and is not prepared to wait. Apart
from Se supplements that have been available for many
years, there is now a greater push towards Se-containing
functional foods and fertilisers and the selection or
breeding of high-Se crop varieties (Broadley et al. 2006).
The worry is that population-based studies will become
increasingly difficult to carry out under these circum￾stances, so that the answer on Se and cancer in populations
may never be definitive unless a European-based trial can
be prioritised.
