Abstract
Neutrophils act as first-line-of-defense cells and the reduction of their
functional activity contributes to the high susceptibilityto and severity
of infections in diabetes mellitus. Clinical investigations in diabetic
patients and experimental studies in diabetic rats and mice clearly
demonstrated consistent defects of neutrophil chemotactic, phagocyt￾ic and microbicidal activities. Other alterations that have been re￾ported to occur during inflammation in diabetes mellitus include:
decreased microvascular responses to inflammatory mediators such as
histamine and bradykinin, reduced protein leakage and edema forma￾tion, reduced mast cell degranulation, impairment of neutrophil adhe￾sion to the endothelium and migration to the site of inflammation,
production of reactive oxygen species and reduced release of cyto￾kines and prostaglandin by neutrophils, increased leukocyte apopto￾sis, and reduction in lymph node retention capacity. Since neutrophil
function requires energy, metabolic changes (i.e., glycolytic and
glutaminolytic pathways) may be involved in the reduction of neutro￾phil function observed in diabetic states. Metabolic routes by which
hyperglycemia is linked to neutrophil dysfunction include the ad￾vanced protein glycosylation reaction, the polyol pathway, oxygen￾free radical formation, the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine-3'-5’mono￾phosphate pathway, and the glycolytic and glutaminolytic pathways.
Lowering of blood glucose levels by insulin treatment of diabetic
patients or experimental animals has been reported to have significant
correlation with improvement of neutrophil functional activity. There￾fore, changes might be primarily linked to a continuing insulin
deficiency or to secondary hyperglycemia occurring in the diabetic
individual. Accordingly, effective control with insulin treatment is
likely to be relevant during infection in diabetic patients.

Diabetes mellitus and inflammation
There is evidence that hormones are in￾volved in the development of the inflamma￾tory response. Inflammation evokes remark￾able changes in the behavior of microves￾sels, hematogenous cells, and other reacting
components. Though these changes are
mainly brought about by release or activa￾tion of endogenous mediators, hormones play

an important part in the control of inflamma￾tion (1,2).
Several aspects have been shown to be
impaired during inflammation in diabetes
mellitus. These include decreased microvas￾cular responses to inflammatory mediators
such as histamine and bradykinin (3,4), de￾creased protein leakage and edema forma￾tion (5-7), reduced mast cell degranulation
(8), decreased leukocyte-endothelial cell in￾teractions and reduced number of leuko￾cytes in inflammatory lesions (9-15), low￾ered airway inflammatory response to anti￾gen challenge (16,17), low superoxide gen￾eration, and reduced release of tumor necro￾sis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1ß and
prostaglandin E2 by leukocytes upon expo￾sure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (18-20);
low content of arachidonic acid in neutro￾phils (20), and a reduction in lymph node
retention capacity (21). These abnormalities
might contribute to the increased suscepti￾bility and severity of infections in diabetic
patients.
In a series of experiments conducted in
the early 1970’s, Garcia-Leme and co-work￾ers (5,6) clearly demonstrated that insulin
exerts direct regulatory effects on several
stages of inflammation. Rats rendered dia￾betic by the administration of alloxan or by
subtotal pancreatectomy fail to present the
edema that follows the injection of chemical
irritants or application of physical stimuli.
This inhibition is abolished by previous in￾jection of insulin and is not associated with
increased blood glucose concentrations. In
addition, diabetic rats exhibit decreased re￾sponses to permeability factors such as his￾tamine, bradykinin, or serotonin injected into
the skin compared to normal rats (5,6). Light
and electron microscopy studies have re￾vealed that microvessels of alloxan diabetic
rats challenged with histamine or serotonin
exhibit less labeling by intravenously in￾jected colloidal carbon particles than do ves￾sels of normal animals (7). The integrity of
the microcirculatory responses to noxious
stimuli may consequently depend on the
availability of insulin.
Neutrophil function in diabetes
mellitus
Neutrophils play an essential role in the
host inflammatory response against infec￾tion. Mowat and Baum (22) showed for the
first time that the chemotactic activity of
neutrophils from diabetic patients is signifi￾cantly lower than in cells from healthy con￾trols. Studies of the phagocytic and microbi￾cidal activities of diabetic patients reveal,
with few exceptions, an impairment of these
functions. Decreased bactericidal activity
(23), impairment of phagocytosis and de￾creased release of lysosomal enzymes (24),
and reduced production of reactive oxygen
species (25) by neutrophils of diabetic pa￾tients have been described. Furthermore, re￾duction in leukocyte phagocytosis and bac￾tericidal activity showed a significant corre￾lation with increases in blood glucose levels
(26). It should be emphasized that investiga￾tion of well-controlled diabetic patients may
fail to demonstrate any consistent defect that
might predispose the patient to infection.
However, in poorly controlled diabetic pa￾tients abnormalities in granulocyte chemo￾taxis, phagocytosis and microbicidal activ￾ity have been described by several groups.
Studies with diabetic rats and mice also
showed a decreased neutrophil migration (9-
12), phagocytosis capacity (27) and hydro￾gen peroxide production (28). Furthermore,
the reduction of blood glucose levels by
insulin treatment of diabetic patients (26) or
rats (28) has been reported to be significant￾ly correlated with improvement of neutro￾phil phagocytosis capacity.
During an inflammatory response, leu￾kocytes roll along the lining endothelium of
post-capillary venules and eventually be￾come firmly attached to the vascular wall
before migrating into tissues. Specific adhe￾sion glycoproteins expressed on the surface

www.bjournal.com.br
of leukocytes and endothelial cells play a
relevant role in the accumulation of leuko￾cytes in the inflammatory lesion (29,30).
Members of the selectin family of cell adhe￾sion molecules are thought to mediate leu￾kocyte rolling along the walls of the mi￾crovasculature (29). Glycoproteins of the
CD11/CD18 complex (ß2integrins) ex￾pressed on leukocytes interact with ligands
such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) on endothelial cells to mediate
leukocyte adhesion and migration (30).
Monoclonal antibodies against cell adhe￾sion molecules either on leukocytes or endo￾thelial cells, or both can effectively inhibit
inflammation (31). Accordingly, one pos￾sible explanation for the abnormal leuko￾cyte function in diabetes mellitus might be a
down-regulation of adhesion molecules that
regulate leukocyte recruitment during the
course of inflammatory processes.
The impaired local exudative cellular re￾action in alloxan-induced diabetic rats is a
consequence of defective leukocyte-endo￾thelial interactions (11,12,15). Intravital mi￾croscopic examination of the internal sper￾matic fascia microcirculatory network
showed that a reduced number of leukocytes
rolling along the venular endothelium is ob￾served from the early stages of diabetes.
Under the influence of an inflammatory
stimulus, only few leukocytes accumulate in
the perivascular tissue of diabetic rats in
contrast to the massive number of leuko￾cytes that normally emerge into the tissue
around a vessel (12). These abnormalities
are not related to changes in mean arterial
pressure and heart rate values, blood flow
velocity, venular shear rate, or blood glu￾cose levels (15). Treatment of diabetic ani￾mals with insulin completely reverses defec￾tive leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Quan￾titation of the immune staining for ICAM-1
in postcapillary venules showed that, rela￾tive to naive rats, there is a significant in￾crease in ICAM-1 protein levels in control
rats under the influence of recombinant rat
TNF-α. A similar effect is observed in ICAM￾1 mRNA levels, suggesting that TNF-α in￾duces transcription and synthesis of ICAM￾1 in the microcirculation. However, in allox￾an-induced diabetic rats increased levels of
ICAM-1 mRNA are not accompanied by a
similar increase in ICAM-1 protein levels.
Furthermore, treatment of diabetic rats with
insulin restores the expression of ICAM-1
on microvascular endothelium to values at￾tained in control rats, without changes in the
levels of mRNA for ICAM-1. The sugges￾tion is that up-regulation of ICAM-1 in￾duced by recombinant rat TNF-α depends
on the availability of insulin (15). On the
other hand, in LPS-induced lung inflamma￾tion, despite no significant differences in
lung ICAM-1 and E-selectin immune stain￾ing between LPS-instilled diabetic rats and
LPS-instilled controls, treatment of diabetic
rats with insulin potentiates the expression
of both adhesion molecules (19), suggesting
that upregulation of both might be associ￾ated with the circulating levels of this hor￾mone. Therefore, the number of leukocytes
migrating to the lungs remarkably increases
after treatment of diabetic rats with insulin
when compared to values observed in LPS
controls (19,20).
High glucose levels and neutrophil
function in diabetes mellitus
Another important advance in under￾standing the pathogenesis of neutrophil dys￾function and inflammatory disorders in dia￾betes is the observation that glucose or its
analogues interact with proteins or lipids.
The end products of this non-enzymatically
catalyzed reaction, termed advanced glyca￾tion (glycosylation or glycoxidation) end
products (AGEs), have been linked to the
development of long-term complications of
diabetes (32). Early glycation and oxidation
processes result in the formation of revers￾ible Schiff bases, which undergo an intramo￾lecular rearrangement to form the Amadori

1040

products like glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
that is elevated in diabetic patients. A small
proportion of these products undergo further
slow and irreversible chemical rearrange￾ments to form AGEs, which accumulate in
the vasculature under conditions that are
accelerated during hyperglycemia and when
protein turnover is delayed (32). By interact￾ing with several different receptors on endo￾thelial cells, smooth muscle cells and infil￾trating mononuclear phagocytes, AGEs
modify cell structure and function leading to
microvascular and macrovascular compli￾cations of diabetes (33). Non-enzymatic gly￾cation of proteins may also interfere with
leukocyte function. Masuda et al. (34) dem￾onstrated that glycosylated proteins sepa￾rated from the serum of diabetic rats de￾crease the membrane fluidity of leukocytes
from control animals and may affect leuko￾cyte migration. Corroborating these obser￾vations, aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of AGE
formation, was shown to prevent the de￾creased leukocyte rolling behavior, as well
as the reduced adhesion and migration of
leukocytes in response to noxious stimuli
observed in alloxan-diabetic rats (11). In￾deed, the presence of a functional receptor
for AGEs at the mRNA and protein level in
human neutrophils is linked to a rise in intra￾cellular Ca2+ and to actin polymerization
(35). In addition, these investigators demon￾strated impaired chemotactic peptide formyl￾Met-Leu-Phe-induced migration of neutro￾phils through endothelial cell monolayers,
suggesting that sustained stimulation of neu￾trophils with AGEs might reduce their abil￾ity to respond to physiological chemotactic
stimuli (35).
The polyol pathway is another metabolic
route by which hyperglycemia is linked to
leukocyte dysfunction. Under physiological
conditions, glucose is converted to glucose￾6-phosphate by hexokinase. When in ex￾cess, because the hexokinase pathway is
saturated, glucose is converted to sorbitol by
aldose reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of
the polyol pathway. Sorbitol is then con￾verted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogen￾ase, and to fructose-3-phosphate by the ac￾tion of 3-phosphokinase (36). Abnormali￾ties in neutrophil functions have been shown
to be associated with the polyol pathway.
The impaired killing of Escherichia coli in
diabetic patients is improved by treatment
with ponalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibi￾tor (37). During the course of an inflamma￾tory response, the reduced number of ad￾hered and migrated leukocytes presented by
diabetic rats is not observed when the ani￾mals are treated with tolrestat, an aldose
reductase inhibitor (13). These observations
demonstrate a positive association between
polyol pathway activation and leukocyte
dysfunction in experimental diabetes melli￾tus. The hypothesis is that the accelerated
formation of sorbitol in diabetic animals
may increase the intracellular osmolarity or
decrease the availability of the enzyme co￾factor NADPH, leading to a disturbance of
endothelial cell functions that might alter
leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. In
fact, inhibition of the polyol pathway cor￾rects the defective leukocyte-endothelial in￾teraction found in experimental diabetes and
may have a similar effect in diabetic patients
(13).
Besides increased polyol pathway flux,
the major metabolic change caused by hy￾perglycemia is an increase in oxygen-free
radical formation, decreased resistance to
oxidative stress and advanced protein glyco￾sylation. All of these factors can trigger the
development of diabetic complications (32).
Antioxidant treatment can also be particu￾larly important regarding decreased leuko￾cyte migration. In support for this hypo￾thesis, Zanardo et al. (14) demonstrated that
vitamin C and probucol, antioxidant agents,
correct the reduced cell migration in alloxan￾diabetic rats. On the other hand, experiments
carried out on neutrophils showed that both
inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity
and protein expression are increased in rats

rendered diabetic by alloxan injection. In
addition, treatment of these animals with
NPH insulin (2 IU/day, for 3 days) reduces
both inducible NO synthase activity and ex￾pression to normal levels (38). Cyclic gua￾nosine-3'-5'-monophosphate (cGMP) con￾tent was determined in these cells for the
investigation of the immediate second mes￾senger effector of NO. Ten days after alloxan
injection, basal levels of cGMP were increased
in neutrophils from diabetic rats compared to
controls. cGMP levels were reduced after treat￾ment of diabetic animals with NPH insulin
for at least 3 days. This information suggests
that insulin modulates cGMP levels in neu￾trophils by NO production and that an in￾crease in the NO-cGMP pathway may con￾tribute to the impaired leukocyte function in
diabetes mellitus (Figure 1).
Neutrophil metabolism and diabetes
mellitus
The maximal activities of several en￾zymes of neutrophil metabolism such as hex￾okinase (glycolytic pathway) and citrate syn￾thase (Krebs cycle) have been investigated
by our group (39,40). Also, the rates of
metabolite production and utilization have
been measured in incubated neutrophils
(28,39,40). The ATP required for neutrophil
functions (22) is mainly produced by the
metabolization of glucose to lactate (41). In
fact, only 2-3% of glucose is oxidized through
the Krebs cycle in neutrophils (42). The
stored glycogen can be utilized by neutro￾phils to obtain energy (43) mainly during the
phagocytosis process. When the intracellu￾lar level of glucose is re-established, the re￾synthesis of glycogen is then initiated (44).
In addition to glucose, however, neutro￾phils also utilize glutamine at high rates
(39). Glutamine is the most abundant amino
acid in plasma and skeletal muscle, being
produced in muscle, lung and liver (45).
Glutamine utilized by neutrophils is mainly
converted to glutamate, aspartate, lactate,
and CO2 (39,46). The partial oxidation of
glucose to lactate and the glutaminolytic
pathway are the main source of ATP and of
the production of intermediate metabolites
for the synthesis of macromolecules such as
fatty acids and phospholipids (40).
Many studies have shown metabolic al￾terations in neutrophils from diabetic pa￾tients. High levels of glucose and ketone
bodies seem to influence neutrophil func￾tion by the production of polyols (47).
Esmann (48) and Munroe and Shipp (49) did
not observe differences in glucose utiliza￾tion by neutrophils from healthy and dia￾betic patients, whereas decreased utilization
of glucose by neutrophils was verified by
others (50,51). Munroe and Shipp (49) did
not observe alterations, whereas Martin et
al. (50) and Esmann (51) found decreased
production of lactate by neutrophils from
diabetic patients. In our study (28), there
was no alteration in glucose consumption or
oxidation by neutrophils from streptozoto￾cin-induced diabetic rats, but decreased lac￾tate production and increased phosphofruc￾tokinase (PFK) maximal activity were ob￾served (Figure 2). Similar results were ob￾served in mesenteric lymph nodes and thy￾mus lymphocytes from diabetic rats (52,53).
The activity of PFK is stimulated by fructose
2,6-biphosphate (54) and inhibited by ATP
at low fructose 6-phosphate content, but not
at high fructose 6-phosphate concentration
(55). Therefore, under these conditions, the
content of intermediates of glycolysis, such

were rendered diabetic by the
injection of alloxan (42 mg/kg,
iv) 10 days before. Insulin (NPH,
2 IU/day, sc) was given for 1 or
3 days before testing. Glycogen￾elicited peritoneal neutrophils
from 3 to 4 rats were pooled,
each animal yielding approxi￾mately 1 x 108 cells. Data are
reported as pmol cyclic GMP per
108 cells, as mean ± SEM of 3
independent experiments (9 to
12 animals in each group). *P <

as fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-
biphosphate, is expected to be elevated in
neutrophils. This may partially explain the
increase in PFK activity. In agreement with
this proposition, Moreno-Aurioles et al. (52)
found increased fructose 2,6-biphosphate
content and PFK activityin neutrophils from
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.
Neutrophils from diabetic rats showed
no significant change in glucose oxidation,
citrate synthase, or NAD+- and NADP+-
linked isocitrate dehydrogenase activities,
suggesting that the flux of substrates through
the Krebs cycle was unchanged (28) (Figure
2). The pentose-phosphate pathway oxidizes
glucose-6-phosphate to intermediates of the
glycolytic pathway, generating NADPH and
ribose-5-phosphate for fatty acid and nucleo￾tide synthesis, respectively (56). NADPH is
important for NADPH oxidase activity and
for glutathione reductase to recycle oxidized
glutathione in neutrophils (57).
Glutamine oxidation and glutaminase
activity are significantly decreased in neu￾trophils from diabetic rats (28) (Figure 2).
Glutamine plays an important role in protein
(as an amino acid source), lipid (by NAD(P)H
production) and nucleotide synthesis (by
purine and pyrimidine production), and in
NADPH oxidase activity (58). Glutamine
raises the in vitro bacterial killing activity
and the rate of reactive oxygen species pro￾duction by neutrophils (57,59). In addition,
Pithon-Curi et al. (60) showed that gluta￾mine has a protective effect on neutrophil
apoptosis. Therefore, decreased glutamine
utilization may contribute to the impaired
inflammatory response in diabetic patients
by increasing the occurrence of apoptosis in
neutrophils.
These data, taken as a whole, show that
neutrophils from diabetic rats present im￾paired metabolism of glucose and glutamine.
On the other hand, palmitic acid oxidation is
increased, and this may compensate for the
reduction in glucose and glutamine utiliza￾Figure 2. Summary of the effects

cells (28).
Concluding remarks
Survival depends on the ability of the
host to respond appropriately to pathogenic
challenges. It has long been recognized that
many diabetic patients have a worse progno￾sis once infection is established. Abnormali￾ties in neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis
and microbicidal mechanisms are responsi￾ble, at least in part, for the increased suscep￾tibility to and severity of infections in dia￾betic patients. Considerable support to these
clinical investigations was given by experi￾mental studies on diabetic rats and mice. In
addition, metabolic routes linked to leuko￾cyte dysfunction, including advanced pro￾tein glycosylation, the polyol pathway, oxy￾gen free radical formation, and the NO-cGMP
pathway, have been described. Insulin re￾stores the appropriate response to injury
through a direct or indirect action on endo￾thelial cells and leukocytes. For future stud￾ies the challenge remains to better under￾stand the integration of both innate and
adaptive immune systems with the endo￾crine and nervous systems, providing new
insights into how inflammation is regulated.
