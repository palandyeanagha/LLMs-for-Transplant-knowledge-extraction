The success of pancreatic b-cells transplantation to treat type 1 diabetes has been hindered by massive b-cell dysfunction and
loss of b-cells that follows the procedure. Hypoxia-mediated cell death has been considered one of the main difficulties that must
be overcome for transplantation to be regarded as a reliable therapy. Here we have investigated the mechanisms underlying
b-cell death in response to hypoxia (1% O2). Our studies show that mouse insulinoma cell line 6 (Min6) cells undergo apoptosis
with caspase-3 activation occurring as early as 2 h following exposure to hypoxia. Hypoxia induces endoplasmic reticulum
stress in Min6 cells leading to activation of the three branches of the unfolded protein response pathway. In response to hypoxia
the pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is upregulated. The important role of CHOP in the
apoptotic process was highlighted by the rescue of Min6 cells from hypoxia-mediated apoptosis observed in CHOP-knockdown
cells. Culturing isolated pancreatic mouse islets at normoxia showed intracellular hypoxia with accumulation of hypoxia￾inducible factor-1a and upregulation of CHOP, the latter one occurring as early as 4 h after isolation. Finally, we observed that
pancreatic islets of type 2 db/db diabetic mice were more hypoxic than their counterpart in normoglycemic animals. This finding
indicates that hypoxia-mediated apoptosis may occur in type 2 diabetes.

Transplantation of the whole pancreas or allogenic islet
transplantation is the therapy of choice to cure type 1 diabetes
patients and to minimize recurrent severe hypoglycemia
achieved by exogenous insulin treatment. Whole pancreas
transplantation has considerable peri-transplant complica￾tions and post-transplantation morbidity. In contrast, islet
transplantation is minimally invasive and has low morbidity.
However, islet transplantation is neither currently leading to
insulin independence nor becoming the successful therapy
that was initially predicted, and it is considered that significant
progress must be achieved for this procedure to be regarded
as a reliable therapy.1 One of the main problems of islet
transplantation is the massive cell death occurring after islet
isolation and transplantation, with the consequent require￾ment of high number of islets in order to restore glucose
homeostasis.2
Pancreatic b-cells consume large amounts of oxygen
during insulin secretion due to the high demand of mitochon￾drial respiration. Oxygen dependence of b-cell function
renders these cells very sensitive to hypoxia. Studies have
shown that 1 day after intraportal transplantation about 70% of
the islets are hypoxic.3 The hypoxic state of b-cells following
isolation and transplantation of pancreatic islets has been
suggested to be a major contributor to b-cell dysfunction and
apoptosis.3,4
Adaptive responses to hypoxia (1% O2) are regulated by
hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that induce transcription
of genes involved, for example, in angiogenesis, glucose
metabolism, and erythropoiesis, In contrast to hypoxia of
1% O2, in cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) exposure to o0.1% O2 (severe hypoxia or anoxia)
induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of

the unfolded protein response (UPR) in a HIF-independent
manner.5–9
In mammalian cells, ER stress causes activation of the ER
stress sensors, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring
endonuclaease-1 (IRE-1) and activating transcription factor 6
(ATF6). These are ER-resident transmembrane proteins that
are able to sense the protein folding status in the ER by
dissociation of immunoglobin binding protein binding immuno￾globin protein (BiP). ER stress sensors are activated by
phosphorylation (PERK and IRE-1) or transport to the Golgi
(ATF6). The PERK pathway attenuates protein translation as
an early response to alleviate ER stress. The transcription
factors induced by UPR, activating transcription factor 4
(ATF4), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) and ATF6 upregu￾late the expression of ER chaperon genes, ER-associated
degradation components and genes that maintain ER home￾ostasis.10 When UPR fails to restore ER homeostasis cells
undergo apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial cell
death pathway.11
In the present study we show that, in contrast to cancer
cells, exposure of pancreatic b-cells to acute hypoxia of 1% O2
leads to ER stress and apoptosis via the mitochondrial cell
death pathway. Hypoxia-induced ER stress upregulates the
pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein
(CHOP). The key role of CHOP in this response was
highlighted by the rescue of b-cells from hypoxia-induced
apoptotic cell death in CHOP-knockdown cells. Finally, we
show that pancreatic islets of type 2 db/db diabetic mice are
hypoxic when compared with islets of normoglycemic mice,
suggesting that hypoxia may contribute to b-cell dysfunction
and cell loss occurring in type 2 diabetes.
Results
Culture of isolated pancreatic islets at normoxia leads to
intracellular hypoxia and cell death. To investigate the
impact on intracellular hypoxia of culturing isolated pancrea￾tic islets at normal oxygen levels we have assessed the
formation of pimonidazole adducts by immunoblot analysis.
Our results show that pancreatic mouse islets kept at
normoxia for 24 h following isolation presented intracellular
hypoxia as indicated by the formation of pimonidazole
adducts (Figure 1a). Staining of islets with an antibody￾recognizing pimonidazole adducts demonstrated that the
central region of an isolated mouse islet becomes hypoxic
after 24 h in culture (Figure 1b). Culturing of pancreatic islets
for 24 h also compromises cell viability. As shown in
Figure 1c islets cultured for 24 h presented a higher number
of dead cells in the center of the islets when compared
with the islets at time point 0 h (Figure 1a). These results
demonstrate a correlation between hypoxia and cell death
in the islet cells.
Exposure of Min6 cells to hypoxia induces apoptosis.
Although several studies have investigated the impact of
hypoxia-induced b-cell death upon islet transplantation,4 the
underlying mechanism of b-cell death has not yet been
unraveled. To investigate whether hypoxia induces apoptosis
of pancreatic b-cells we exposed the mouse insulinoma cell
line 6 (Min6)12 or primary mouse brain endothelial cells
(MBECs) to 1% O2 (hypoxia). Our results show that 24 h of
hypoxia induces apoptosis in Min6 cells as illustrated by the
detection of TUNEL (terminal dUDP nick-end labeling)-
stained cells. In contrast to Min6 cells, no TUNEL-positive
cells were observed in MBECs (Figure 2a). FACS analysis of
cells stained in the TUNEL assay showed that 11 or 55% of
cells undergo apoptosis after 8 or 24 h of hypoxia, respec￾tively (Supplementary Figure 1). As expected, in both Min6
and MEBCs, HIF-1a protein levels were increased in
response to hypoxia (Figure 2b).13,14 In Min6 cells, active
caspase-3 was detected after 2 h of hypoxia treatment, and
the induction peaked at 8 h, indicating that commitment of
Min6 cells to apoptosis occurs after a short period of
exposure to hypoxia. Treatment of Min6 cells and MBECs
with the apoptosis inducer staurosporine upregulated clea￾vage of caspase-3 (Figure 2b). In contrast to staurosporine,
treatment with the ER stress inducer thapsigargin only
upregulated active caspase-3 levels in Min6 cells indicat￾ing that b-cells are more sensitive to ER stress-induced CalceinAM/PI

apoptosis than the endothelial cells used in this study.
In contrast to caspase-3 protein levels, mRNA levels
of CASP3 were not induced by hypoxia or thapsigargin
(Figures 2c and 2d) and exposures longer than 4 h of
hypoxia downregulated expression of the CASP3 gene
(Supplementary Figure 2a). To assess the contribution of
caspase-3 activity to hypoxia-induced apoptosis, we have
treated Min6 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
and performed FACS analysis to quantify TUNEL-positive
cells. Treatment of Min6 cells with Z-VAD-FMK inhibited
caspase-3 activation (Figure 2e) As demonstrated in
Figure 2f inhibition of caspase activity rescued Min6 cells
from hypoxia-induced apoptosis (from 49.9% in untreated
cells to 28.2% in Z-VAD-FMK-treated cells). In conclusion,
these results show that Min6 cells undergo apoptosis in
response to acute hypoxia of 1% O2 and activation of
caspase-3 is required for the apoptotic cell death.
HIF-1a does not contribute to hypoxia-dependent apop￾tosis in Min6 cells. Earlier studies have suggested that
HIF-1a could participate in hypoxia-mediated apoptosis by
stabilizing p53 or by upregulating the pro-apoptotic regulator
BNIP3.15 Expression of HIF-1a has also been shown to
colocalize topographically with active caspase-3 in the
pancreatic islets indicating a correlation between HIF-1a
expression and b-cell apoptosis.13 In this context, we have
investigated the role of HIF-1a in hypoxia-induced apoptosis
in Min6 cells. To this end we used lentivirus delivery to
generate stable cells expressing short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) specifically targeting HIF-1a expression.

Induction of b-cell apoptosis by hypoxia of 1% O2

Cell Death and Disease

Successful HIF-1a knockdown was achieved in two different
cell lines named HIF-1a#1 and HIF-1a#2 (Figure 3a and
Supplementary Figures 3a and b). In these cell lines hypoxia￾induced upregulation of procaspase-3 and active caspase-3
demonstrating that induction of apoptosis is not HIF-1a￾dependent. FACS analysis of cells stained by TUNEL
showed that apoptosis in HIF-1a knockdown stable cells
was not significantly distinct from control cells (control cells:
63.2%, stable cell line HIF-1a#1: 64.2%, and HIF-1a#2:
68.7% TUNEL positive; Figure 3c). Cell viability was also
assessed, and we observed that there was no significant
difference between control and HIF-1a knockdown cells
following hypoxia treatment at different time points
(Figure 3d). The role of HIF-2a in the apoptotic response
was not investigated because previous studies have
indicated that mouse b-cells do not express HIF-2a.
16
Consistent with these observations, we have failed to
detect the HIF-2a transcript in Min6 cells (data not shown).
In conclusion, our results show that HIF-1a does not
contribute to apoptosis or apoptosis-independent cell death
induced by exposure of Min6 cells to 1% O2.
Hypoxia activates the UPR in the pancreatic b-cell line
Min6. Induction of ER stress leads to activation of UPR to
restore ER homeostasis. However, when ER stress is not
resolved UPR-dependent pathways will lead to apoptosis.11
As we have observed that hypoxia induces apoptosis of Min6
cells by a HIF-1a-independent mechanism we investigated
whether exposure of the cells to 1% O2 activated the UPR.
One of the first events in response to ER stress is PERK￾mediated phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor
eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) leading to the reduction
of global protein synthesis and preferential translation of
selected mRNAs including ATF4.10,17 Our results show that
in Min6 cells, but not in MEBCs, phosphorylated levels of
eIF2a were upregulated and peaked at 8 h of hypoxia
treatment (Figure 4a). Protein levels of ATF4 were also
increased in response to hypoxia. Between 1 and 48 h of
hypoxia ATF4 levels were upregulated above the levels
observed in normoxic cells with the induction peaking at 2, 4
and 48 h of exposure (Figure 4a). ATF4 mRNA levels were
also induced with the peak at 4 h of hypoxia exposure
(twofold; Figure 4f). In contrast to the induction observed
at 2–6 h, long exposure to hypoxia (24 or 48 h) led to
downregulation of ATF4 gene expression (Supplementary
Figure 2b). These results demonstrate that the PERK/eIF2a/
ATF4 branch of the UPR is activated by exposure to 1% O2 in
Min6 cells, and that high levels of ATF4 protein are sustained
during hypoxia treatment.
The involvement of IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR was
also investigated. In Min6 cells, the activated IRE-1 protein
accumulates at 2 and 4 h of hypoxia (Figure 4b), whereas the
spliced form of XBP-1 is detected at 4 and 8 h of hypoxia
(Figure 4c) indicating that the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR
is also activated in response to 1% O2.
The third branch of UPR is mediated by ATF6. Our results
show that cleavage of ATF6 was induced by hypoxia in Min6
cells, resulting in depletion of the 90-kDa uncleaved form and
appearance of the 50-kDa cleaved form of ATF6 (Figure 4d).
The cleaved form of ATF6 is detected after 1 h of hypoxia and
accumulates during the first 8 h of treatment consistent with
activation of the ATF6 branch of the UPR in Min6 cells
exposed to 1% hypoxia.
Together these pathways upregulate the transcription of
UPR target genes such as the ER chaperon BiP, which will
contribute to the restoration of protein folding homeostasis.18
Our results show that protein levels of BiP were upregulated
by hypoxia in Min6 cells (Figure 4e). However, although we
observed increased expression or activation of the three UPR
transcription factors ATF4, XBP-1 and ATF6 known to induce
BiP gene expression,19,20 BiP mRNA levels were not
upregulated in response to hypoxia (Figure 4i).

Induction of b-cell apoptosis by hypoxia of 1% O2

Cell Death and Disease

Treatment of Min6 cells with thapsigargin showed that both
protein and mRNA levels of components of the UPR pathways
were positively regulated by the ER stress inducer in Min6
cells (Figures 3a–e and j–m). In contrast to thapsigargin,
hypoxia treatment inhibited mRNA expression of XBP-1,
ATF6 and BiP genes (Figures 3g–i; Supplemetary Figure 2b)
indicating that, although the UPR pathway is activated by 1%
O2 in Min6 cells, the induced mechanism does not trigger the
same response as thapsigargin.
Hypoxia changes levels of expression of several Bcl-2
family proteins in Min6 cells. B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2
(Bcl-2) family proteins have a pivotal role in the induction
of apoptosis in response to ER stress.21 We therefore
examined the impact of hypoxia on the expression levels of
several proteins of the Bcl-2 family. As shown in Figure 5a,
levels of Bcl-2 family members were unchanged in MBECs,
whereas in Min6 cells, the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins
p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Bad and
Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were elevated after 8 h of
hypoxia treatment. To further investigate whether Bad is
activated in response to hypoxia, we have assessed protein
levels of phosphorylated-Bad. Our results show that Ser112 of
Bad was completely dephosphorylated after 8 h of hypoxia

(Figure 5a). Dephosphorylation of Bad occurs as early as 2 h
of hypoxia and was inhibited at late time points of treatment
(24–48 h; Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure 4). Regula￾tion of Bcl-2 interacting mediator (Bim) in response to
hypoxia presented a more complex pattern of regulation
with an accumulation of the protein at 1–2 h of treatment
(Supplementary Figure 4) and a second peak of induction at
48 h (Figure 5a). Hypoxia also downregulated protein levels
of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL at early time points
whereas Bcl-2 levels were slightly reduced after 48 h of
treatment. mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was
also analyzed. Only PUMA and Bim mRNA levels were
induced by hypoxia. Time points of PUMA upregulation
correlated positively with the time course upregulation of
protein levels (Figure 5b), indicating that PUMA is transcrip￾tionally induced by hypoxia. In contrast to PUMA, Bim mRNA
levels were only induced at 48 h of hypoxia indicating that
Bim is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional
levels. In contrast to PUMA and Bim, the other genes
analyzed were downregulated or remained unchanged in
response to hypoxia indicating that Bad and Bax are post￾transcriptionally regulated. Activation of the ER located
caspase-12 was not observed in Min6 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5).
To demonstrate the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway we have investigated whether hypoxia activates
caspase-9 in Min6 cells. Our results show that treatment of the
cells with 4–8 h of hypoxia led to accumulation of cleaved
caspase-9 (Figure 5c), indicating activation of the mitochon￾drial apoptotic pathway.
Regulation of CHOP by hypoxia in Min6. CHOP has been
identified as an ER stress-induced transcription factor that is
a significant mediator of apoptosis in response to ER
stress.22,23 We therefore examined the impact of hypoxia
treatment on CHOP expression in Min6 cells. As shown in
Figure 6a, protein levels of CHOP were upregulated by
hypoxia in Min6 cells, but not in endothelial cells. In Min6
cells, protein accumulation was increased in a time-depen￾dent manner from 4 to 24 h of hypoxia treatment. Increased
protein levels correlated with induction of CHOP gene
expression (Figure 6b). As expected, thapsigargin upregu￾lated protein and mRNA levels of CHOP (Figures 5a
and c).24
Induction of CHOP gene expression has been shown to be
primarily mediated by the PERK/eIF2a/ATF4 UPR pathway,
although contribution of the other two other arms of the UPR

indicated time points. Cells were treated during 8 h with 1 mM thapsigargin (Tg), or
1 mM staurosporine (St). Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and proteins were

pathway has also been suggested.25,26 We therefore inves￾tigated the contribution of each UPR branch to CHOP gene
induction by using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting
the corresponding UPR transcription factors. In parallel we
also transiently silenced HIF-1a and Arnt expression. The
efficiency of knockdown of each transcription factor is shown
in Supplementary Figures 6a–e. Silencing ATF4, XBP-1 or
ATF6 expression significantly reduced hypoxia-dependent
induction of CHOP mRNA levels, while silencing of HIF-1a or
Arnt had no impact on CHOP induction (Figure 6d). In contrast
to CHOP, hypoxia-mediated induction of the HIF target genes

and was insensitive to silencing of UPR transcription factors
(Figure 6e, Supplementary Figures 6f and g). These results
show that the three branches of UPR contribute to upregula￾tion of CHOP in response to hypoxia of 1% O2.
CHOP is the main mediator of hypoxia-induced apoptosis
in Min6 cells. To investigate the contribution of CHOP to
apoptosis induced by hypoxia in Min6 cells, we generated by
lentivirus delivery stable cells expressing shRNAs specifically
targeting CHOP expression. Efficient knockdown of CHOP
was achieved in two different cell lines named CHOP#1, and
CHOP#2 (Figure 7a). Upon 24 h of hypoxia treatment, the
levels of active caspase-3 were dramatically diminished in
CHOP-knockdown cell lines when compared with control
cells (Figure 6b). FACS analysis of cells stained by TUNEL
showed that apoptosis induced by hypoxia was significantly
decreased from 57.7% in control cells to 12.2% and 10.1% in
CHOP#1 and CHOP#2 stable cell lines, respectively
(Figure 7c), indicating that silencing CHOP expression
rescued Min6 cells from apoptotic cell death. Cell viability
was also partially rescued in CHOP-knockdown cells from
45.9% in control cells to 65.7 and 71.8% in CHOP#1 and
CHOP#2 stable cell lines upon 24 h of exposure to hypoxia,
or from 31.1 to 49.8% and 63.9% upon 48 h of exposure to
hypoxia, respectively (Figure 7d). Considering that silencing
CHOP expression only partially rescued Min6 cell viability at
hypoxia, it is conceivable that other pathways contribute to
hypoxia-induced cell death. In agreement with this hypo￾thesis our studies show that LC3B-II protein levels were
induced by hypoxia indicating upregulation of autophagy
(Supplementary Figure 7). In conclusion, these results
suggest that CHOP is a major contributor to Min6 cells
apoptosis at hypoxia.
CHOP protein is upregulated in isolated pancreatic
islets cultured at normoxia. As our results showed that
pancreatic islets cultured at normoxia present intracellular
hypoxia (Figures 1a and b) we have investigated whether
CHOP protein was activated in this condition. With this aim
we have cultured isolated pancreatic islets for different
periods of time and we have assessed protein levels of HIF-1a
and CHOP. Our results show that HIF-1a accumulated in
the islets in culture with the peak of protein stabilization at
8 h of culture (Figure 8a). Also protein levels of CHOP were
upregulated starting as early as 4 h and remained induced
up to 24 h of culture. These results indicate that although
islets are cultured at normoxia, b-cells became hypoxic
with subsequent induction of the pro-apoptotic transcription
factor CHOP.
Islets of db/db mice are hypoxic. Previous studies have
shown that islets of the diabetic db/db mice have higher
levels of apoptotic cells when compared with islets of his
counterpart control mice.27,28 However, the state of oxygen
availability in the islets of these animals has not been
previously investigated. We have therefore assessed the
potential hypoxic status of these islets by evaluating the
formation of pimanidazole adducts. As shown in Figure 8b
islets of db/db mice are stained positively for the hypoxia
marker adduct pimonidazole while no staining was detected
in the islets of control animals. These observations indicate
that b-cells of db/db mice are hypoxic with levels of oxygen
below 1.5% O2 making the above-described apoptotic
mechanism a potential pathogenic mechanism in type 2
diabetes.
Discussion
Pancreatic b-cells are particularly sensitive to hypoxia, which
has been suggested to contribute to the massive cell loss that
occurs during the isolation and transplantation of islets.2,29
Here we have investigated the mechanism underlying
apoptotic b-cell death in response to hypoxia and we have
identified hypoxia of 1% O2 as a new pathological ER stress
inducer in pancreatic b-cells. Pathological ER stress is
induced by exposure of b-cells to stimuli such as chronic
high glucose, free fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines.30

Induction of b-cell apoptosis by hypoxia of 1% O2

Cell Death and Disease

pathological ER stress highlights the dependence of b-cell
function on molecular oxygen. The correct folding of proinsulin
in the ER requires the formation of three disulphide bonds, a
process that requires molecular oxygen.31 Therefore, lack of
molecular oxygen will lead to accumulation of unfolded
proinsulin and other proteins compromising b-cell function
and disrupting ER homeostasis.
Molecular oxygen is also consumed in large amounts by
b-cells due to the dependence of insulin secretion on ATP
production. Thus, both secretion of insulin and correct folding
of proinsulin will be compromised when b-cells become
hypoxic. Interestingly, in contrast to other cell types, b-cells
display a hypoxic phenotype even following very modest
reductions in oxygen supply.32 The dependence on molecular
oxygen for b-cell function suggests a potential role for hypoxia
in type 2 diabetes. Indeed, our results show that islets of db/db
animals are more hypoxic than their control counterparts.
These results are in agreement with a recent study using two
other diabetic mouse models, ob/ob and kky, where hypoxia
was detected in pancreatic islets.32
Hypoxia is known to induce ER stress in cancer cells or
MEFs.5–9 However, the oxygen levels required for induction
of ER stress in these cells are much lower than 1% O2.
In contrast to b-cells, in cancer cells or MEFs activation of UPR
is observed in response to prolonged and severe hypoxia
or anoxia (o0.1% O2).33 In cancer cells or MEFs, severe
hypoxia leads to inhibition of global translation and to
activation of the transcription factors ATF4 and XBP-1.5–9
The involvement of the ATF6 branch of UPR in hypoxia￾induced ER-stress has not been as well documented as the
two previously described branches. However, ATF6 activation
was observed in response to ischemia in a primary cardiac
myocyte model.34 Activation of UPR has been suggested to
protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, as illustrated
by the higher sensitivity to hypoxia-induced apoptosis
observed in PERK and XBP-1 knockout MEFs.5,7,9 However,
prolonged or intense hypoxic stress will lead to apoptosis of
cancer cells or MEFs. Our results indicate that in Min6 cells
the three branches of UPR are activated and all of them
contribute to the upregulation of the ER stress-dependent
pro-apoptotic regulator CHOP. The key role of CHOP in the
apoptotic process in b-cells in response to 1% O2 exposure is
clearly demonstrated by the rescue of Min6 cells from
hypoxia-induced apoptotic cell death following knockdown
of CHOP.
In response to ER stress the translation initiation factor
eIF2a is phosphorylated by PERK leading to attenuation of the
translation of most mRNAs.10,17 Inhibition of translation by the
PERK/eIF2a branch of UPR may account for downregulation
of gene expression observed at latter time points of hypoxia
for several components of the UPR and Bcl-2 family proteins.
These observations suggest that in Min6 cells under hypoxia,
transcription of hypoxia-target genes is efficiently maintained
while the transcription of many non-target genes is inhibited
due to repression of translation.
Activation of apoptosis executor caspases is a process that
is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Among these,
the BH3-only domain proteins PUMA and Bim are known
to be activated by ER stress and then convey the signal to
the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery.21 Early induction of
PUMA and Bim by hypoxia correlates well with the increase
in cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 observed, suggesting
that PUMA and Bim are initiators of the apoptotic process in
Min6 cells. Changes in expression of BCL-2 family of proteins
with the consequent activation of caspase-9 demonstrate
that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by hypoxia in
Min6 cells.
Pancreatic islets transplantation is minimally invasive and
therefore has the potential to become a major therapeutic
approach to treat type 1 diabetes patients.1 However, it is well
established that the success of this therapy is jeopardized
by the massive cell death occurring during islet isolation
and transplantation.1,2 This question is highlighted in our
study by the cell death occurring in cultured islets kept at
normoxia, which was positively correlated with the high levels
of intracellular hypoxia. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic factor
CHOP identified in Min6 cells as a major driving factor of
hypoxia-induced apoptosis is upregulated in isolated islets
after a few hours of culture. Early induction of CHOP protein
in cultivated islets indicate an early activation of apoptosis
and emphasizes the importance of preventing intracellular
hypoxia in order to maintain b-cell function during islet
transplantation.
Previous studies have shown that islets in db/db mice have
a higher number of b-cells undergoing apoptosis when
compared with islets of control animals.27,28 Also UPR
components such as Bip and XBP-1 and the pro-apoptotic
transcription factor CHOP have been shown to be upregu￾lated in db/db pancreatic islets.35,36 Furthermore, an increase
in CHOP protein has been observed in human islets of
diabetic patients.35 The hypoxic state that we have now
identified in db/db islets and the induction of ER stress and
apoptosis that we observed in Min6 cells following exposure
to 1% O2 suggest that hypoxia may trigger b-cell dysfunction
and cell loss during the progression of type 2 diabetes.
In conclusion, we have identified induction of ER stress
together with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic CHOP protein
as the main pathway mediating b-cell apoptosis in response to
environmental or intracellular hypoxia. The finding that
pancreatic islets of a type 2 diabetic mouse model are hypoxic
suggests that hypoxia-mediated b-cell death may contribute
to the progression of type 2 diabetes.

Animals and experimental protocol. C57BL/KsJm/Leptdb (db_/db_)
mice (Stock 000662) and their normoglycemic heterozygous litter-mates were
obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA), housed five per cage in a
12-h light/dark cycle at 22 1C and provided ad libitum with standard laboratory food
and water. The animals were caged individually for 1 week and handled daily.
Isolation of pancreatic islets for cell viability assays was performed from 5–8
week-old female C57BL/6 mice as previously described.37 Isolation of pancreatic
islets for preparation of whole-cell extracts was performed from 6-month-old male
C57BL/6 as previously described.37 The animal experimental procedures were

Staining for pimonidazole adducts. The hypoxia level within the
pancreatic islets of mice 12–14 weeks of age was assessed using the
Hypoxyprobe kit (Natural-Amersham Pharmacia, Burlington, MA, USA) following
the instructions of the manufacturer. Analysis was done blinded by two observers
in a semiquantitative manner, using a four-point scale (0, no positive cells;
1, low number of positive cells; 2, moderate number of positive cells; and 3, high
number of positive cells). Staining for pimonidazole adducts in the isolated islets
was described previously.32
Cell culture and hypoxia treatment. The mouse pancreatic beta cell line
Min6 was kindly provided by Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Osaka University, Japan.12
Min6 cells (passages 20–32) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium

negative control (1027310) siRNA were obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).
siRNA (100 nM) was transfected into Min6 cells using Lipofectamin 2000
(Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were cultured under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions for 24 h before harvest.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting assays. Cells were lysed in
high salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and 20% glycerol)
supplemented with 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 5 mM
2-mercaptoehanol. Isolated islets were sonicated in lysis buffer (25 mM Hepes,
100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM b-glycerophosphase, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mM
o-vanadate) supplemented with 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, 2 mM
dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor mix (Complete-Mini; Roche

Lentiviral transduction for generation of shRNA-mediated
stable knockdown cell lines. MISSION lentiviral transduction particles
expressing shRNA targeting HIF-1a (HIF-1a#1: TRCN0000232222, HIF-1a#2:
TRCN0000054448) or CHOP (CHOP#1: TRCN0000103709, CHOP#2:
TRCN0000103707) and lentiviral-negative control particles (SHC002V) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stably transduced cell lines were generated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded on a
12-well plate. The following day cells were infected. After 24 h medium was
changed. Selection of stable clones started 24 h later with the addition of 2 mg/ml
of puromycin. Knockdown efficiency of different cell lines was determined by
immunoblot analysis and real-time PCR.
TUNEL assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using the DeadEnd
Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and image was captured
using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Goettingen,
Germany). Apoptosis was also quantitatively determined by flow cytometry of
cells stained with a FITC-labeled anti-BrdU antibody using the APO-BRDU
kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Detached cells present in the supernatant were included in the assay.
Viability assay. Cell viability was determined by measuring live-cell protease
activity using the CellTiter-Fluor Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For viability assays in isolated islets, the islets were
cultured in RPMI containing 11.1 mmol/l glucose supplemented with 10% FBS for
24 h under normoxic conditions. Then, the islets were incubated with Calcein-AM

(1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and propidium iodide (10 mg/ml, Invitrogen) for 20 min at
37 1C. After washing the islets with PBS, the images were captured by CDD
camera (CoolSNAP, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) under a microscope (IX70,
OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). The ratio of the propidium iodide staining positive islets
per total islets was calculated. 46 islets for 0 h, and 52 islets for 24 h from tree
mice each were analyzed.
XBP-1 splicing assay. Total RNA was reversely transcribed using Super￾script II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The region of XBP-1 containing the splice junction was then amplified
by PCR using primers (sense: 50
-AAACAGAGTAGCAGCGCAGACTGC-30
;
antisense: 50
-TCCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG-30
) with the cycling conditions
of 94 1C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 1C for 10 s, 65 1C for 30 s, and 72 1C
for 30 s. Unspliced (uXBP-1, 476 bp) and spliced (sXBP-1, 450 bp) XBP-1 fragments
were separated in 3% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Caspase-12 activity. Caspase-12 activity was measured by a fluorometric
assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed, and proteins (150 mg) were transferred into a
black-bottom 96-wells microplate and incubated with the caspase-12 substrate
ATAD-AFC (50 mM) for 1.5 h at 37 1C. Results were analyzed using a fluorescence
plate reader (Ex/Em ¼ 400/505 nM). Control reactions were performed with no
protein in the wells and by omitting the substrate.
