Viruses can enter the body by diverse routes, infect almost 
every type of host cell and mutate to avoid immune 
recognition. Destroying rapidly dividing viruses effi￾ciently requires the coordination of multiple immune 
effector mechanisms. At the earliest stages of infection, 
innate immune mechanisms are initiated in response 
to the binding of pathogens to pattern-recognition recep￾tors (PRRs), and this stimulates the antiviral activities of 
innate immune cells to provide a crucial initial block on 
viral replication. Innate immune responses then mobi￾lize cells of the adaptive immune system, which develop 
into effector cells that promote viral clearance.
Activation through PRRs causes professional antigen￾presenting cells (APCs) to upregulate co-stimulatory 
molecules and promotes the migration of these cells to 
secondary lymphoid organs. Here, they present virus￾derived peptides on MHC class II molecules to naive 
CD4+ T cells and deliver co-stimulatory signals, thereby 
driving T cell activation. The activated CD4+ T cells 
undergo extensive cell division and differentiation, giv￾ing rise to distinct subsets of effector T cells (BOX 1). The 
best characterized of these are T helper 1 (TH1) and TH2 
cells, which are characterized by their production of 
interferon‑γ (IFNγ) and interleukin‑4 (IL‑4), respec￾tively1
. Specialized B cell helpers, known as follicular 
helper T (TFH) cells, and the pro-inflammatory TH17 cell 
subset also develop, along with regulatory T (TReg) cells, 
which are essential for avoiding over-exuberant immune 
responses and associated immunopathology2
.
A key role of CD4+ T cells is to ensure optimal 
responses by other lymphocytes. CD4+
 T cells are neces￾sary as helpers to promote B cell antibody production 
and are often required for the generation of cytotoxic and 
memory CD8+ T cell populations. Recent studies have 
defined additional roles for CD4+ T cells in enhancing 
innate immune responses and in mediating non-helper 
antiviral effector functions. We discuss what is known 
about the T cell subsets that develop following acute 
viral infection and how different subsets contribute 
to viral control and clearance.
Following a rapid and effective antiviral response, 
infection is resolved and the majority of effector CD4+
T cells die, leaving a much smaller population of memory 
CD4+ T cells that persists long-term3,4. Memory CD4+
T cells have unique functional attributes and respond 
more rapidly and effectively during viral re-infection. 
A better understanding of the functions of memory 
CD4+
 T cells will allow us to evaluate their potential con￾tribution to immunity when they are induced by either 
infection or vaccination. We describe the antiviral roles 
of CD4+ T cells during the first encounter with a virus 
and also following re-infection.
Generation of antiviral CD4+
 T cells
To develop into effector populations that combat viral 
infections, naive CD4+ T cells need to recognize pep￾tide antigens presented by MHC class II molecules on 
activated APCs. PRR-mediated signalling activates 
APCs to upregulate their expression of MHC class II 
molecules, co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD80 
and CD86) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such 
as type I IFNs, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL‑1, 
IL‑6 and IL‑12)5
. When the activated APCs migrate to 
draining lymph nodes, they prime naive virus-specific 
CD4+ T cells, which then differentiate into antiviral 
effectors (FIG. 1). The priming environment can vary

Expanding roles for CD4+ T cells in 
immunity to viruses
Susan L. Swain, K. Kai McKinstry and Tara M. Strutt
Abstract | Viral pathogens often induce strong effector CD4+
 T cell responses that are best 
known for their ability to help B cell and CD8+
 T cell responses. However, recent studies have 
uncovered additional roles for CD4+
 T cells, some of which are independent of other 
lymphocytes, and have described previously unappreciated functions for memory CD4+
 T cells in 
immunity to viruses. Here, we review the full range of antiviral functions of CD4+
 T cells, discussing 
the activities of these cells in helping other lymphocytes and in inducing innate immune 
responses, as well as their direct antiviral roles. We suggest that all of these functions of CD4+
T cells are integrated to provide highly effective immune protection against viral pathogens.

T-bet
A member of the T‑box family 
of transcription factors. T-bet 
is a master switch in the 
development of T helper 1 (TH1) 
cell responses through its ability 
to regulate the expression of 
the interleukin‑12 receptor, 
inhibit signals that promote TH2 
cell development and promote 
the production of interferon‑γ.
dramatically during different viral infections and is 
influenced by many variables, including the route of 
infection, the viral dose and the organ or cell types 
targeted. As has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, 
the extent of T cell proliferation and the determina￾tion of T cell subset specialization are affected by the 
specific subset of APCs that is activated6,7
, the antigen 
load and the duration of antigen presentation8
, and 
the patterns and amounts of cytokines produced by 
different APCs9
.
Effector TH cell subsets in viral infection
In contrast to TH cell populations that are generated 
in vitro, effector T cells that are found in vivo are often 
characterized by plasticity and heterogeneity in terms 
of their cytokine-producing potential. Nevertheless, 
the CD4+ T cells that are generated in response to viral 
infection mainly have a TH1‑type phenotype and pro￾duce large amounts of IFNγ and express T‑bet. This 
phenotype classically depends on the exposure of 
T cells to high levels of IL‑12, type I IFNs and IFNγ in 
Box 1 | Subsetting CD4+
 T cell responses based on TH cell polarization
Following recognition of a specific antigen presented by an appropriately activated antigen-presenting cell, naive 
CD4+
 T cells undergo several rounds of division and can become polarized into distinct effector T helper (TH) cell 
subsets that differentially orchestrate protective immune responses (see the figure). The differentiation of polarized 
effector T cells is controlled by unique sets of transcription factors, the expression of which is determined by multiple 
signals but particularly by soluble factors that act on responding CD4+
 T cells during their activation. The elucidation 
of the crucial cytokines that govern the differentiation of distinct TH cell subsets has allowed researchers to examine 
the protective capacities of differently polarized CD4+
 T cell subsets in several models of infectious disease.
Although the production of the signature cytokines interferon‑γ (IFNγ), interleukin‑4 (IL‑4) and IL‑17 is routinely used 
to assign subsets (TH1, TH2 and TH17, respectively) to responding CD4+
 T cells, it is increasingly clear that considerable 
plasticity exists within TH cell subsets in vivo, especially during responses to pathogens. Moreover, certain cytokines 
(for example, IL‑10) can be produced by subpopulations of cells within multiple effector subsets. Finally, the successful 
clearance of viral pathogens in particular often depends on complex CD4+
 T cell responses that encompass multiple 
TH cell subsets. Together, these T cell subsets are capable of mediating direct antiviral functions, of providing help for 
B cells, of regulating immunopathology and of mediating cytotoxic killing of virus-infected cells. CD4+
 T cells with 
cytotoxic activity have been described in several models of viral disease as well as in the clinic. Following re-stimulation, 
memory CD4+
 T cells retain their previous effector functions and rapidly produce effector cytokines. This property of 
primed CD4+
 T cells represents a key advantage of the memory state.
Certain TH cell subsets — including follicular helper T (TFH) cells and regulatory T (TReg) cells — are often defined less by 
their cytokine profile and more by their functional attributes. Further studies will be required to determine whether 
populations of CD4+
 T cells with specialized functions can include cytokine-polarized cells from several subsets.

the priming milieu10, although TH1 cell responses are 
generated in response to certain viruses independently 
of IL‑12 or type I IFNs11–13, suggesting that other fac￾tors can also contribute to TH1 cell polarization. IL‑12 
and type I IFNs promote TH1 cell differentiation both 
directly and indirectly (by repressing the development 
of other TH cell subsets), and can even influence effector 
T cells that are already polarized. For example, polar￾ized TH2 cells that were transferred to hosts infected 
with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 
acquired a mixed TH1/TH2 cell phenotype, which was 
characterized by high levels of IFNγ production and 
diminished IL‑4 production. Interestingly, most IFNγ￾producing cells in the TH1/TH2 cell population co￾produced IL‑4 or IL‑13, and IL‑12 and type I IFNs were 
shown to drive this mixed TH1/TH2 cell phenotype14. 
In vivo, IL‑12 can also reprogramme in vitro-polarized 
TH17 cells to a TH1‑type phenotype15,16.
Originally, it was thought that IL‑4‑producing TH2 
cells were needed to drive optimal humoral immune 
responses. Thus, the predominance of TH1 cells over 
TH2 cells during viral infection was somewhat surpris￾ing, given the important role of neutralizing antibodies 
in viral clearance and in providing long-term immunity 
to re-infection. However, adoptive transfer of either TH1 
cells or TH2 cells was shown to provide efficient help for 
the generation of neutralizing antiviral IgG responses17,18. 
The signature TH1‑type cytokine, IFNγ, enhances IgG2a 
class switching, and this explains why IgG2a is usually the 
dominant isotype in IgG responses generated against 
viruses19.In fact, several studies have found that, far from 
promoting antiviral responses, TH2 cell-associated media￾tors (and IL‑4 in particular) have a strong negative impact 
on immune protection and drive immunopathology 
during infection with many viruses, including influenza 
virus20,21, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)22, herpes 
simplex virus (HSV)23 and vaccinia virus24. Instead, it is 
now clear that IL‑4‑producing TFH cells provide much of 
the help required for IgG1 production (see below).
The roles of TH17‑type effector responses during viral 
infection are not well understood, but virus-specific 
IL‑17‑producing CD4+ T cells have been detected in 
mice following infection with mouse cytomegalovirus 
(MCMV)25, HSV26, vaccinia virus27
, Theiler’s murine 
encephalomyelitis virus28 or influenza virus16, although 
at levels lower than those of TH1 cells. The generation 
of polarized TH17 cells during viral infection has been 
correlated with high levels of IL‑6 and may also be 
influenced by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)28. 
TH17 cells are implicated in driving harmful inflamma￾tion during autoimmunity, and IL‑17 may contribute 
to immunopathology during responses against viruses, 
as demonstrated in studies using influenza virus or 
vaccinia virus27,29. However, in some cases, TH17 cells 
contribute to host protection against viruses16. One pro￾tective mechanism mediated by TH17 cells might be the 
promotion of enhanced neutrophil responses at sites 
of infection. IL‑17 upregulates CXC-chemokines that 
promote neutrophil recruitment30, and neutrophils can 
contribute to protection against certain viruses, includ￾ing influenza virus31. We expect that other roles for 
TH17 cells will be identified in future studies, as TH17 
cells often produce significant levels of IL‑21 and IL‑22 
in addition to IL‑17 (REF. 16). Although not extensively 
studied in viral systems, IL‑22 production by TH17 
cells could be involved in regulating the expression of 
defensins, and could also play an important part in tissue 
repair (reviewed in REF. 32). IL‑21 production may also 
regulate aspects of the innate immune response during 
viral infection. Moreover, IL‑21 is involved in sustaining 
CD8+ T cell responses during chronic viral infection, as 
discussed below.
Figure 1 | Generation of antiviral effector CD4+
 T cells. The crucial initial steps 
in generating primary antiviral T cell responses are the uptake of viral antigens by 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in infected tissue, the activation of APCs by pattern￾recognition receptor (PRR) ligation, and the migration of these cells to draining lymph 
nodes. The nature of the viral infection, as well as PRR ligation, can influence the 
activation status of antigen-bearing APCs and the T helper (TH) cell-polarizing 
environment. The recognition of antigens on activated APCs by naive T cells during viral 
infection predominately results in the generation of TH1 cells owing to the presence of 
type I interferons (IFNs) and interleukin‑12 (IL‑12). However, TH17, TH2 and regulatory T 
(TReg) cell populations are also generated to some degree in certain viral infections.

Class switching
The process by which 
proliferating B cells rearrange 
their DNA to switch from 
expressing the heavy-chain 
constant region of IgM 
(or another class of 
immunoglobulin) to 
expressing that of a different 
immunoglobulin class, thereby

different effector functions. The 
decision of which isotype to 
generate is strongly influenced 
by the specific cytokine milieu

T helper cells.

antibodies.

Roles of CD4+
 T cells during primary infection
Although the best-studied pathways of CD4+ T cell￾mediated help are those that promote antibody produc￾tion by B cells, CD4+ T cells also enhance effector CD8+
T cell responses during certain viral infections and con￾tribute to the maintenance of a functional memory CD8+
T cell pool (FIG. 2). Furthermore, effector CD4+ T cells 
regulate the inflammatory response and can directly 
mediate viral clearance.
CD4+ T cell-mediated help for B cells. Current licensed 
vaccines directed against viral pathogens are evaluated 
almost exclusively on their ability to generate strong 
neutralizing antibody responses. Antibody-mediated 
protection can be extraordinarily long-lived33, and 
neutralizing antibodies present at the time of patho￾gen encounter can prevent rather than combat infec￾tion, thereby achieving ‘sterilizing’ immunity. Thus, 
it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which 
CD4+ T cells help B cells during viral infection in order 
to define what is required for effective vaccination 
(FIG. 2a). CD4+ T cells that enter B cell follicles and pro￾vide help to B cells, resulting in germinal centre forma￾tion, are now referred to as TFH cells. The generation 
and functions of TFH cells have been expertly reviewed 
elsewhere34,35, so we focus only on the roles of these 
cells during viral infection.
Following viral infection, the expression of SLAM￾associated protein (SAP) by TFH cells is necessary to 
direct the formation of germinal centres36,37
, where 
TFH cells promote the generation of B cell memory and 
long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells36,38. Thus, 
TFH cells are likely to be important for generating long￾lived antibody responses and protective immunity to 
most, if not all, viruses. Indeed, CD4+ T cells have been 
shown to be required for the generation of optimal anti￾body responses following infection with coronavirus39, 
vaccinia virus40, yellow fever virus41 or vesicular sto￾matitis virus (VSV)42. It is not yet clear how distinct 
cytokine-polarized CD4+ T cell subsets influence the 
B cell response during primary viral infection. One 
possibility is that distinct TH cell subsets, such as TH1, 
TH2 and TH17 cells, can each develop into TFH cells and 
provide efficient help for B cells. This hypothesis is 
supported by a recent study demonstrating that such 
polarized subsets can be reprogrammed to express TFH
cell characteristics in vitro43. As different TH cell sub￾sets have been associated with distinct antibody class￾switching responses, the broad range of protective anti￾body isotypes that is often found in individuals with 
immunity to a virus favours such a model.
Several co-stimulatory ligands expressed by CD4+
T cells contribute to the promotion of B cell activation 
and antibody production. One notable ligand is CD40 
ligand (CD40L). Interactions between CD40 (which is 
expressed on B cells) and CD40L (which is expressed on 
activated CD4+ T cells) are crucial for generating opti￾mal humoral responses against several viral pathogens, 
including LCMV, Pichinde virus, VSV, HSV and influ￾enza virus44–46. The expression of inducible T cell co￾stimulator (ICOS) by TFH cells has also been shown to 
be important for germinal centre formation34, and ICOS 
expression is required for optimal induction of humoral 
responses against LCMV, VSV and influenza virus47. 
The roles during viral infection of other co-stimulatory 
molecules expressed by TFH cells are less clear. For exam￾ple, OX40‑deficient mice generate normal levels of 
class-switched antibodies during infection with LCMV, 
VSV or influenza virus48. Further studies are required to 
determine the importance of additional signals that pass 
between TFH cells and B cells in generating protective 
antibody responses during viral infection.
CD4+ T cell-mediated help for CD8+ T cells. The mecha￾nisms by which CD4+ T cells promote CD8+ T cell effec￾tor and memory responses are less well understood than 
B cell help. As in B cell help, CD40L–CD40 interactions 
between CD4+ T cells and APCs are crucial (FIG. 2). One 
possible mechanism — the ‘licensing’ of APCs by CD4+
T cells — may be of only minor importance during 
viral infection, as APCs can be activated effectively by 
viruses through PRRs49,50, thus obviating the need for 
this process50–52. However, it is unclear whether APCs 
that are activated directly through PRRs are functionally 
similar to those licensed by CD4+ T cells53. An absence 
of CD4+ T cells has been shown to compromise the 
generation of primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) 
responses against vaccinia virus54 and HSV55 (and influ￾enza virus in some, but not all, studies56–58), suggest￾ing that the two modes of APC activation are distinct. 
Whether CD4+ T cell-mediated help is required for the 
generation of optimal antiviral CD8+ T cell responses 
probably depends on which elements of the innate 
immune response are triggered following infection 
by a virus and to what extent. For example, the strong 
type I IFN response that is induced by administration of 
polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) can bypass 
the otherwise obligate requirement for CD4+ T cell￾mediated help in the generation of CD8+
 T cell responses 
following vaccinia virus infection59. 
It is not clear whether different TH cell subsets have 
distinct roles in helping CD8+ T cells. During the pri￾mary response, the licensing of APCs by CD4+ T cells 
probably occurs before the full polarization of effec￾tor CD4+ T cells, but fully polarized TH cells might 
also promote efficient CD8+ T cell responses against 
viral pathogens through mechanisms other than APC 
licensing. For example, chemokines produced following 
antigen-specific interactions between APCs and CD4+
T cells can actively attract CD8+ T cells to the activated 
APCs60, and CD40L–CD40 interactions between CD4+
T cells and APCs can protect APCs from CTL‑mediated 
death61, perhaps leading to more-efficient CD8+
T cell priming.
In addition, CD4+ T cells facilitate the develop￾ment of functional, pathogen-specific memory CD8+
T cells that can respond following re-infection51,52,62,63. 
One mechanism by which CD4+ T cells promote this 
process involves the downregulation of TNF-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression on 
responding CD8+ T cells (FIG. 2). It is thought that CD8+
T cells that are helped by CD4+ T cells downregulate

TRAIL expression and become less susceptible64, or 
have delayed susceptibility65, to TRAIL-mediated apop￾tosis. By contrast, CD8+
 T cells that have not been helped 
undergo enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis follow￾ing antigen re-exposure. CD4+ T cell-mediated help 
also controls the expression of other molecules. For 
example, CD4+ T cells downregulate the expression of 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on CD8+
 T cells, 
and this can enhance the function of pathogen-specific 
memory CD8+ T cells66–68.
CD4+ T cells may promote the generation of effec￾tor and memory CD8+
 T cell populations through many 
possible pathways. One such pathway involves enhanc￾ing the APC-mediated production of cytokines that 
augment initial CD8+ T cell responses; these cytokines 
include IL‑1, IL‑6, TNF and IL‑15 (REF. 69). Paracrine IL‑2 
produced by CD4+ T cells during the initial priming of 
CD8+ T cells in LCMV infection dramatically improves 
the CD8+
 T cell recall response potential70. Furthermore, 
CD4+
 T cells have been shown to upregulate the expres￾sion of CD25 (also known as IL‑2Rα) on CD8+ T cells 
during infection with vaccinia virus or VSV71. At later 
stages of the response, CD4+ T cells produce additional 
cytokines, such as IL‑21, which appears to be a crucial 
signal for downregulating TRAIL expression on CD8+
T cells responding to vaccinia virus72. Finally, evidence 
suggests that direct ligation of CD40 on naive CD8+
T cells by CD40L on CD4+ T cells can enhance the 
generation of memory CD8+
 T cells73 (FIG. 2).
CD4+ T cells seem to be particularly important for 
maintaining memory CD8+ T cell populations74, and the 
presence of CD4+ T cells during priming may influence 
the homing pattern and, ultimately, the tissue distribu￾tion of memory CD8+ T cells75. Whereas a specialized 
T cell subset (namely, TFH cells) provides help for B cells, 
no analogous helper subset for CD8+ T cells has been 
identified to date. Defining the conditions that lead to 
the generation of CD4+ T cells with potent CD8+ T cell 
helper activity could be important for developing better 
vaccines against several viral pathogens.
More than just lymphocyte helpers
In addition to activating cells of the innate immune sys￾tem and providing potent help to promote the functions 
of B cells and CD8+ T cells during viral infection, CD4+
T cells develop into populations of effector T cells that 
migrate to sites of infection76. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that effector CD4+
 T cells have potent protective 
roles during viral infection that are independent of their 
helper activities. Strong immune protection mediated 
by CD4+ T cells has been described in animal models 
of infection by rotavirus77
, Sendai virus78,79, gamma￾herpesviruses80,81, West Nile virus (WNV)82, HSV83,84, 
influenza virus85,86, dengue virus87
, Venezuelan equine 
encephalitis virus88, coronavirus89, VSV90 and Friend 
virus91,92. In many cases, the direct protective mechanism 
used by CD4+ T cells has not been defined. However, 
effector CD4+ T cells have, in general, been shown to 
protect against viral pathogens through two distinct 
mechanisms: first, through the production of cytokines, 
most notably IFNγ and TNF81,82,85,87,89,90,92; and second, 
through direct cytolytic activity78,81,82,87,92 mediated by 
both perforin and FAS (also known as CD95)84,86 (FIG. 3). 
Cytotoxic CD4+
 T cells have also been observed following 
infection with LCMV93.
The cytotoxic activity of CD4+ T cell effectors does 
not depend on TH1 cell polarization94, and expression of 
the transcription factor eomesodermin, but not T‑bet, 
may be crucial in driving the development of cytotoxic 
CD4+
 T cells in vivo95. Thus, CD4+
 T cells with cytotoxic 
activity could be considered a separate functional T cell 
subset. The fact that MHC class II expression is largely 
restricted to professional APCs under steady-state condi￾tions may limit the protective potential of virus-specific 
cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. However, cells other than pro￾fessional APCs are capable of upregulating MHC class II 
expression following pathogen challenge and could 
therefore become targets of cytotoxic CD4+
 T cells during 
viral infection. For example, epithelial cells that are acti￾vated by infection96 or IFNγ-mediated signals97 strongly 
upregulate their expression of MHC class II molecules.
Although immune protection mediated by cyto￾toxic CD4+ T cells requires direct recognition of virus￾infected cells, soluble factors released by other effector 
CD4+ T cells can act more broadly. For example, IFNγ 
can promote the establishment of an antiviral state in 
surrounding tissue and can also activate several innate 
immune cell populations, most notably macrophages, to 
mediate antiviral activity98. Thus, effector CD4+ T cells 
that migrate to infected tissues probably promote viral 
clearance through both cytotoxic and cytokine-dependent 
mechanisms.
Immunoregulation by effector CD4+
 T cells
Effector CD4+ T cells are capable of potent immuno￾regulation at sites of infection. A subset of TH1 cells has 
been found to transiently produce both IFNγ and IL‑10 
at the peak of the effector CD4+
 T cell response in many 
models of infectious disease99. Several signals have been 
found to stimulate the generation of IL‑10‑producing 
effector CD4+ T cells, including high levels of antigen, 
soluble factors such as IL‑12 and IL‑27, and co-stimulatory 
signals such as ICOS (reviewed in REF. 99). IL‑10 is a pleio￾tropic cytokine that is most often associated with anti￾inflammatory or inhibitory functions (FIG. 3). The impact 
of IL‑10 production by effector CD4+ T cells is compli￾cated and can be variable, especially in situations in which 
strong immune responses (which are capable of serious 
immunopathology) are required to eliminate a rapidly 
replicating pathogen. For instance, the absence of IL‑10 
during influenza virus infection can lead, on the one hand, 
to improved host survival, owing to enhanced T cell16
and antibody100 responses, but also, on the other hand, to 
exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology, which 
result in increased mortality101. Similarly, ablating Il10 has 
been found to enhance protection against WNV102 and 
vaccinia virus103, but to cause increased pathology follow￾ing infection with RSV104 and death following infection 
with mouse hepatitis virus105 or coronavirus106. Finally, as 
well as producing IL‑10 themselves, effector CD4+
 T cells 
can also promote IL‑10 production by effector CD8+
T cells during viral infection107.

Regulatory CD4+
 T cells
Increased frequencies of CD4+ TReg cells (of both the 
forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ and FOXP3–
 populations) 
have been observed in numerous human and animal 
studies of viral infection. Most studies that have assessed 
the impact of TReg cells during viral infection have con￾centrated on models of chronic infection. In such set￾tings, TReg cells have been found, depending on the 
particular pathogen, to have both beneficial roles, such 
as limiting collateral tissue damage, and detrimental 
roles, including diminishing the overall magnitude of 
antiviral immune responses108. The antigen specificity 
of TReg cells in the context of infectious disease has not 
been addressed often, but it is likely that TReg cell popula￾tions contain at least some virus-specific cells and that 
these populations are generated in concert with antiviral 
effector T cell responses. Indeed, this has recently been 
shown in a coronavirus infection model109. The accumu￾lation of virus-specific FOXP3+ TReg cells during viral 
infection could be due to the expansion of pre-existing 
populations of thymus-derived ‘natural’ TReg cells that 
are specific for viral antigens, or could also reflect the 
de novo generation of ‘induced’ TReg cells from naive 
virus-specific CD4+ T cells. An important factor in the 
generation of induced TReg cells appears to be TGFβ110,111, 
although how induced TReg cells affect viral infection is 
not yet well understood. For example, some viral patho￾gens may promote the development of TReg cell popula￾tions to limit the host antiviral response. Evidence for 
this hypothesis has been found in several models, mainly 
of chronic viral infection112,113. In acute viral infection, 
which has not been studied as fully as chronic infection, 
TReg cells have been shown to limit pathology during 
infection with WNV114 or RSV115,116 and in a model of 
influenza A virus infection117. A detailed account of TReg
cell induction and responses during viral infection is 
available elsewhere118.
CD4+
 T cells and chronic viral infection
Compared with our understanding of CD8+ T cells119, 
much less is known about how chronic infection affects 
CD4+ T cell phenotype and function. However, the 
impact of persistent viral infection on CD4+ T cell func￾tion and the importance of CD4+ T cells during chronic 
viral infection are receiving increasing attention. During 
persistent infection with LCMV clone 13, responding 
CD4+ T cells lose the ability to produce TH1‑type effec￾tor cytokines and to function optimally following viral 
rechallenge120. The loss of function of CD4+ T cells 
responding to persistent antigen is probably driven by

Box 2 | CD4+
 T cell help for CD8+
 T cells during chronic viral infection
The best-characterized function of CD4+
 T cells during persistent viral infection is the 
maintenance of competent CD8+
 T cells that retain robust effector functions long-term153. 
Although this has been most-rigorously studied in models of lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
virus (LCMV) infection, CD4+
 T cells have also been found to affect CD8+
 T cell 
responses to varying degrees in other models of chronic infection, including mouse 
cytomegalovirus154, mouse polyomavirus155 and gammaherpesvirus156 infection. Recent 
studies using LCMV infection suggest that interleukin‑21 (IL‑21) production by CD4+
T cells during chronic infection is crucial for maintaining functional CD8+
 T cells that are 
able to contain the infection157–159. Importantly, clinical evidence also correlates the 
presence of higher numbers of IL‑21‑producing CD4+
 T cells with improved CD8+
 T cell 
function and improved control of HIV infection160,161. These observations suggest new 
avenues that could improve vaccination strategies and adoptive transfer therapies162
through the generation of CD4+
 T cell populations specifically geared towards the 
provision of maximal help in the context of chronic infection.
Box 3 | Tissue-resident memory T cells
Following the resolution of primary immune responses, most effector T cells die by apoptosis, leaving behind a small 
population of long-lived memory cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in addition to recirculating through 
lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, some memory cells reside at sites of infection. Although most of these studies have 
concentrated on CD8+
 T cell memory, CD4+
 T cells also appear to survive for long periods in peripheral tissues163,164.
Often, the expression of distinct surface proteins distinguishes tissue-specific memory cells from conventional 
lymphoid memory populations. These molecules are likely to have a crucial role in the retention of memory T cells at 
different sites through specific interactions with ligands that are expressed in particular tissues. For example, the 
expression of α1β1 integrin (also known as VLA1) by airway-resident memory CD4+
 T cells in the lungs can facilitate 
binding to collagen164, and high levels of CD103 expression by brain- or skin-resident memory CD8+
 T cells facilitates 
their interaction with cells that express E‑cadherin165,166.
Tissue-resident memory T cells act as a first line of defence. Combined with the ability of memory T cells, but not naive 
T cells, to be activated through the recognition of antigens in peripheral tissues132,167, the location of memory CD4+
 T cell 
populations at potential sites of re-infection represents a powerful advantage of the memory state over the naive state, 
in which a lag of several days precedes the influx of antigen-specific cells into infected sites. Tissue-resident memory cells 
may facilitate more-rapid recruitment and activation of innate cell populations that are capable of controlling initial viral 
titres. Moreover, these memory cells may simultaneously accelerate the development of pathogen-specific effector 
populations of B and T cells by promoting the earlier activation of antigen-presenting cells. Elucidating the important 
cues that drive the development of long-lived tissue-resident memory cells is likely to become an important area of 
research, especially as this understanding may lead to the design of improved vaccination strategies. 
high levels of antigen following the priming phase121
and seems not to be regulated by the intrinsic changes 
in APCs that are caused by chronic viral pathogens120.
Chronic infection may not lead to irreversible exhaus￾tion of responding CD4+
 T cells. For example, function￾ally impaired CD4+
 T cells have been observed in patients 
with HIV, and treatment with antibodies that stimulate 
CD28 (REF. 122), block T cell immunoglobulin domain 
and mucin domain protein 3 (TIM3)123 or block PD1 
signalling124 dramatically increased the proliferative 
potential of these T cells in vitro. Also, a recent study by 
Fahey et al. found that during chronic LCMV infection 
responding CD4+
 T cells progressively adopt a functional 
TFH cell phenotype125. That CD4+
 T cells may retain spe￾cific functions during chronic infection helps to explain 
earlier observations that persistent LCMV infection is 
eventually cleared through mechanisms that are depend￾ent on CD4+ T cells (BOX 2). For instance, interactions 
between exhausted CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells may 
restore CD8+ T cell function during chronic infection 
with LCMV126. These findings and others (reviewed in 
REFS 127,128) have important implications for the design 
of vaccines against viruses that cause chronic infection 
in humans (such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C).
Memory CD4+
 T cell responses against viruses
Following the resolution of infection, or after successful 
vaccination, most virus-specific effector CD4+
 T cells die. 
This leaves a small population of memory T cells, which 
ensures that the frequency of virus-specific T cells is 
greater than it was before priming. The population of 
CD4+ memory T cells diminishes with time and may 
require boosting. It is unclear which responding effector 
CD4+ T cells make the transition to a memory pheno￾type, but a recent study suggests that those with lower 
expression of LY6C and T‑bet have a greater potential 
to do so129. A quantitative gain in antigen-specific cells 
represents one important advantage of the memory state, 
but memory T cells also differ from naive T cells by 
broad functional criteria. Compared with naive T cells, 
memory CD4+ T cells respond much faster, respond to 
lower antigen doses, require less co-stimulation and 
proliferate more vigorously following pathogen chal￾lenge130. In addition, subpopulations of memory CD4+
T cells have wider trafficking patterns and some are 
retained at or near sites of previous infection131, and this 
contributes to their ability to be rapidly activated follow￾ing local re-infection. Tissue tropism and/or retention 
of tissue-resident memory CD4+ T cells may depend on 
specific interactions between adhesion molecules and 
their receptors (BOX 3).
Memory CD4+ T cells enhance early innate immune 
responses following viral infection. Memory CD4+
T cell-mediated recognition of antigens presented by 
APCs following re-infection has rapid consequences. 
Within 48 hours of intranasal infection with influenza 
virus, antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells cause an 
enhanced inflammatory response in the lung, and this 
is characterized by the upregulation of a wide array 
of pro-inflammatory mediators132 (FIG. 4). In infected 
tissues, transferred TH1‑type and TH17‑type memory 
cells, as well as memory CD4+ T cells generated by 
previous infections, upregulate the expression of pro￾inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including

Figure 4 | Activation of APCs through PRRs and through the recognition of 
antigens by memory CD4+
 T cells. a | Several classes of pattern-recognition receptors 
(PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), sense the presence of viral pathogens, and the 
triggering of these receptors leads to the activation of antigen-presenting cells(APCs), 
including dendritic cells (DCs). Activated APCs upregulate their expression of MHC 
molecules and co-stimulatory molecules, which are important for the priming of naive 
virus-specific T cells. Triggering of PRRs at the site of infection induces local 
inflammation, which involves the activation of several populations of innate immune 
cells that can control viral titres and establish chemokine gradients to attract further 
antiviral effector cells. The efficiency of PRR triggering can determine whether viral 
replication or protective immunity gains the upper hand. b | Virus-specific memory CD4+
T cells can directly activate DCs through the recognition of antigens presented by MHC 
class II molecules, even in the absence of co-stimulation delivered via PRR-mediated 
signalling. The crucial signals delivered by memory CD4+
 T cells to DCs in this process are 
unclear and could involve both cell-surface interactions and cytokine signals. The 
outcome of DC activation and the initiation of inflammatory responses are similar 
whether triggered through PRRs or memory CD4+
 T cells but, in situations of infection 
with a rapidly replicating virus (such as influenza virus), memory CD4+
 T cell-mediated 
enhancement of innate immunity is substantially quicker and more effective than that

IL‑1α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, IL‑12p40, CC-chemokine ligand 2 
(CCL2), CXC-chemokine ligand  9 (CXCL9) and 
CXCL10. By contrast, TH2‑type and non-polarized 
(TH0) memory T  cells have a minimal impact on 
pulmonary inflammation following influenza virus 
challenge. To induce innate inflammatory responses, 
memory CD4+ T cells must recognize antigens on 
CD11c+ APCs. These APCs become activated during 
interactions with memory CD4+ T cells, and this results 
in the upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory 
molecule expression by the APCs. Activated APCs con￾tribute to the subsequent innate inflammatory response 
through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
such as IL‑6 and IL‑1β. By contrast, the naive CD4+
T cell response in vivo does not have an appreciable 
impact on the tissue inflammatory response at 48 hours 
post-infection132. In other studies, naive CD4+ T cells 
could actually downregulate tissue inflammation fol￾lowing mouse hepatitis virus infection133. The ability 
of TH1‑type and TH17‑type memory CD4+ T cells, but 
not TH2‑type or non-polarized memory T cells, to pro￾mote an early inflammatory response may help to explain 
why transfer of virus-specific TH1 and TH17 effector cells, 
but not transfer of TH2 or non-polarized T cells, pro￾motes early control of viral loads in mice infected with 
influenza virus16,86,132. A similar impact of memory CD4+
T cells on early viral control during secondary influenza 
infection was recently reported by Chapman et al.134, 
and this also correlated with a dramatic enhancement 
of innate immune responses against the virus. However, 
this effect has not yet been studied in other models of 
viral infection.
We suggest that the early activation of innate immune 
mechanisms by memory CD4+ T cells serves to lessen 
the ‘stealth phase’ of infection, during which titres of the 
virus are still too low to generate robust inflammatory 
responses135. This would prevent viruses from gaining a 
‘foothold’ in the host by infecting and replicating in cells 
at a level that is below immune detection. Importantly, 
the induction of early innate immune responses by 
memory CD4+ T cells does not require PRR activa￾tion132 and could therefore be important for enhancing 
protection against viral pathogens — such as vaccinia 
virus and influenza virus — that can actively antagonize 
key components of innate recognition pathways, such as 
dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)136.
One intriguing finding is that memory CD4+ T cells 
specific for ovalbumin enhance antiviral immunity when 
ovalbumin is co-administered with an influenza virus 
that does not express ovalbumin132. Thus, we hypoth￾esize that the induction of innate immune responses 
by memory CD4+ T cells could have an adjuvant effect, 
which could be exploited (and substituted for PRR stim￾ulation132) to promote immune responses to vaccines 
that do not contain live viruses. For example, a vaccine 
could activate the innate immune system through 
antigen-specific stimulation of memory CD4+ T cells 
that are known to be widespread in the human popula￾tion (for example, most individuals have memory CD4+
T cells specific for tetanus toxin). This method could 
possibly enhance the immunogenicity of ‘weak’ vaccines.
Heterologous memory responses. Heterologous viral 
immunity occurs when memory T cells that were gen￾erated in response to a particular virus cross-react with 
epitopes expressed by other, unrelated viruses. It has 
recently become clear that this is quite a widespread 
phenomenon that is likely to be important in the 
human population, as humans are exposed to numer￾ous antigens as a result of infection and vaccination137.

Although heterologous immune responses can be 
protective, they may in some cases be deleterious and 
can result in dramatic immunopathology138. It will be 
important to determine to what extent the ability of 
memory CD4+ T cells to induce innate immunity con￾tributes to both beneficial and deleterious heterologous 
responses.
Helper functions of memory CD4+ T cells. Several stud￾ies indicate that memory CD4+ T cells are superior 
to naive T cells in providing help for B cells, and they 
have been shown to promote earlier B cell prolifera￾tion, higher antibody levels and earlier class-switching 
responses compared with naive CD4+ T cells139–141. In 
many cases, when pre-existing circulating antibodies 
are able to recognize the virus, re-infection may never 
occur. Faster antibody production could be particu￾larly important after re-infection with rapidly mutat￾ing viruses (such as influenza virus), as the generation 
of neutralizing antibodies specific for new variants 
that evade previously generated antibodies could be 
necessary for immunity.
That memory CD4+ T cells are superior helpers 
for B cells compared with naive T cells is suggested 
by multiple criteria, and many mechanisms may con￾tribute. Memory CD4+ T cells contain preformed 
stores of CD40L, an important signal in CD4+ T cell￾mediated help for antibody production142. The location 
of memory CD4+ T cells may also be an advantage. For 
example, antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells with a 
TFH cell phenotype are retained in the draining lymph 
nodes of mice for over 6 months following immuni￾zation143. The increased levels and polarized profile of 
cytokines produced by memory CD4+ T cells, as com￾pared with those of naive T cells, is likely to promote a 
more-robust B cell antibody response and to dictate the 
antibody isotype, which has a key role in the efficacy 
of antibodies specific for viruses such Ebola virus144, 
WNV145 and influenza virus146. Recent observations 
suggest that IL‑4 and IFNγ produced by TFH cells have 
a central role in driving not only immunoglobulin class 
switching in the germinal centre, but also B cell affinity 
maturation147.
Whether memory CD4+ T cells are superior to naive 
CD4+ T cells at providing help for primary or second￾ary CD8+ T cell responses during viral infection has not 
been rigorously tested. However, the features of memory 
cells described here suggest that memory CD4+ T cells 
could promote an accelerated response by naive CD8+
T cells, both through more-rapid licensing of APCs 
and through faster and more-robust production of 
IL‑2 and possibly other cytokines; these possibilities 
need to be explored. In support of this concept, a study 
using Listeria monocytogenes found that TH1‑type but 
not TH2‑type memory CD4+ T cells enhanced primary 
CD8+ T cell responses in terms of both magnitude and 
cytokine production, although the mechanism of mem￾ory CD4+ T cell-mediated help was not determined148. 
Whatever the pathways involved, the fact that memory 
CD4+ T cells enhance the generation of CD8+ T cell 
memory and that this process has a greater dependence 
on CD4+ T cell-mediated help when PRR stimulation 
is limited suggests that CD4+ T cell-mediated help will 
be of particular importance in achieving optimal CD8+
T cell memory responses with vaccines that do not 
contain live, replication-competent viruses.
Finally, we should point out that the impact of 
memory CD4+ T cells on the early innate immune 
response may also affect subsequent antigen-specific 
immune responses against viruses, owing to altera￾tions in the expression of chemokines. For example, 
by upregulating local production of CC-chemokine 
receptor 5 (CCR5) ligands at the site of infection, 
memory CD4+ T cells can promote the recruitment 
of memory CD8+ T cells that contribute to early viral 
control in influenza virus infection149. In HSV‑2 infec￾tion, IFNγ expression by CD4+ T cells is required to 
induce chemokines that recruit effector CD8+ T cells 
to the infected vaginal tissue150. Similar roles for CD4+
T cells in promoting CD8+ T cell recruitment may 
occur during infections with other viruses, although 
it is often difficult to separate the roles of CD4+ T cells 
in generating effector CD8+ T cells from their roles in 
modifying CD8+ T cell trafficking39,85,151.
Secondary effector T cells
The presence of memory CD4+
 T cells that are capable of 
producing multiple cytokines has been correlated with 
superior protective capacity in numerous studies152, 
but how such cells achieve enhanced protection has 
not been addressed. One possibility is that ‘secondary’ 
effector CD4+ T cells that arise from memory precur￾sors may be much more efficient in directly combating 
pathogens than primary effector CD4+ T cells that arise 
from naive cells. Our recent experiments that directly 
compared such primary and secondary effectors during 
influenza virus infection support such a view (T.M.S., 
K.K.M., L. M. Bradley and S.L.S., unpublished obser￾vations). We found that following adoptive transfer of 
either antigen-specific memory CD4+
 T cells or an equal 
number of antigen-specific naive CD4+
 T cell precursors, 
the secondary effector populations that developed from 
the memory CD4+ T cells showed greater expansion 
and contained higher frequencies of T cells that secrete 
multiple cytokines. Furthermore, although high levels of 
IL‑10 were produced by primary effector CD4+ T cells 
during influenza virus infection, secondary effector 
cells produced much less IL‑10. Thus, memory CD4+
T cells seem to give rise to secondary effector T cells 
that are distinct from and superior to the primary effec￾tors derived from naive CD4+ T cells. We suggest that 
this results in more-protective recall responses, and we 
predict that further functions of secondary effectors 
will be discovered as additional comparative analyses 
are carried out.
Summary
Here, we have reviewed how CD4+ T cells contribute 
to protective immunity to viruses, during both pri￾mary and secondary infections. Several key principles 
emerge. Distinct CD4+ T cells subsets — including TH1 
cells, TH17 cells, TFH cells and CD4+
 T cells with cytotoxic

functions — have important roles in the antiviral 
response. Key among these roles is the provision of help 
to B cells, but CD4+
 T cells also contribute to the antiviral 
response by producing cytokines and chemokines, by 
enhancing CD8+ T cells responses and through direct 
cytotoxic effects on virus-infected cells.
Memory CD4+ T cells have additional protective 
functions compared with naive cells. They induce early 
innate inflammatory responses in the tissue that con￾tribute to viral control. Importantly, memory CD4+
T cells provide more-rapid help to B cells, and prob￾ably to CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to a faster 
and more-robust antiviral immune response. Finally, 
secondary effectors derived from memory CD4+ T cell 
precursors are likely to be more capable of mediating 
direct antiviral activity than primary effectors derived 
from naive CD4+ T cells.
The picture that emerges is one in which CD4+
 T cells 
carry out an impressive variety of functions at differ￾ent times and in different sites, and we suggest that the 
synergy of these distinct mechanisms can provide an 
extraordinarily high level of viral control. Depending on 
the particular pathogen and the level of infection, these 
mechanisms may often be redundant, but they are likely to 
each make key contributions following exposure to high 
doses of rapidly replicating viruses or to viruses that have 
evolved mechanisms to evade specific immune pathways. 
We point out that the study of the immune response to 
viral infections has revealed new mechanisms by which 
CD4+ T cells function to protect against pathogens, and 
we predict that additional mechanisms will be identi￾fied in the future. Thus, this area of study will lead to a 
better understanding of how vaccines can be designed to 
harness the power of CD4+
 T cell memory.
