ARTICLE FIGURES AND DATA INFO AND METRICS
Abstract
Although venous thromboembolism rates and risk factors are well
described in patients with cancer, there are limited data on the
incidence, risk factors and outcomes of thrombosis after allogeneic
stem cell transplantation, a curative therapy for patients with
hematologic malignancies. We aimed to determine the incidence
and risks associated with venous thrombosis in allogeneic stem cell
transplants. We studied 2276 recipients of first transplant between
2002–2013 at our institution with a median follow up of 50 months
(range 4–146). Using pharmacy records and subsequent chart
reviews, 190 patients who received systemic anticoagulation for
venous thrombosis were identified. The 1-and 2-year cumulative
incidence of all venous thrombotic events were 5.5% (95%
confidence interval (CI) 4.6–6.5%) and 7.1% (95% CI 6.1–8.2%),
respectively. There was no difference in age, sex, body mass index,
diagnosis, disease risk index, conditioning intensity, donor type or
graft source between transplant recipients with and without
subsequent thrombosis. In multivariable models, both acute and
chronic graft-versus-host disease were independently associated with
thrombosis occurrence (Hazard ratio (HR)=2.05, 95% CI 1.52–
2.76; HR=1.71, 95% CI 1.19–2.46, respectively). Upper extremity
thrombosis differed from all other thromboses in terms of timing,
risk factors and clinical impact, and was not associated with non-
relapse mortality (HR=1.15; 95% CI 0.69–1.90), unlike all other
thromboses which did increase non-relapse mortality (HR=1.71;
95% CI 1.17–2.49). In subgroup analysis evaluating conventional
thrombosis predictors by comparing patients with and without
thrombosis, a history of prior venous thrombosis was the only


significant predictor. Venous thromboembolism has a high
incidence after allogeneic stem cell transplant and is associated with
graft-versus-host disease and non-relapse mortality.
Introduction
The care of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), a curative modality for advanced/
aggressive hematologic malignancies, is highly complex, involving
central venous catheters, conditioning chemotherapy, immune
suppressive therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of graft-versus-
host disease (GvHD), donor graft infusions, and infection
monitoring and treatment. Their medical acuity and complexity
makes allogeneic HSCT recipients potentially vulnerable to venous
thromboembolism (VTE) despite eradication of the underlying
malignancy, but this complication remains incompletely
characterized. Studies in autologous HSCT recipients have described
a VTE incidence between 3% and 23.5%31 but this incidence
cannot be directly extrapolated to allogeneic HSCT recipients. For
instance, autologous HSCT recipients are not at risk of GvHD and
have a lower risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease, both of which
are associated with vascular disruption and prolonged systemic
inflammation. Many autologous HSCT recipients are also
increasingly exposed to thrombophilic medications such as
lenalidomide for multiple myeloma (MM), which creates a VTE risk
profile that is different from allogeneic HSCT recipients.
Limited studies in allogeneic HSCT recipients have reported a wide
range in the incidence of VTE, from 0.5% to 13%.104 The older
studies are difficult to interpret as allogeneic transplant practices
have changed over time. For example, a study that examined the
risk of VTE in a cohort of over 400 HSCT recipients included
patients receiving heparin as prophylaxis for veno-occlusive
disease.11 This is no longer a common strategy and would have
altered the incidence of VTE. A recent meta-analysis of 12 studies in
allogeneic HSCT recipients estimated the cumulative incidence of
VTE at 4% (95% CI 2–6%), but was fraught with significant
heterogeneity between studies (I2=80).12
Although some studies have described an association between


GvHD and the risk of VTE, the follow up was generally short, and
insufficient to determine if the risk of VTE changes over time.1310
The largest cohort study of 1514 HSCT recipients (including
approximately 60% autologous transplants), reported that 4.6% of
patients developed VTE.10 This study, however, had only 6 months
of follow up after HSCT, making it difficult to establish an
association between chronic GvHD and VTE. Furthermore, it
included mostly myeloablative conditioning regimens, making it
difficult to assess VTE incidence after reduced-intensity
conditioning regimens.
We therefore sought to rigorously examine the risk of VTE after first
allogeneic HSCT in a large retrospective cohort of patients
uniformly treated at a single center, describing VTE incidence, sites
of involvement, risk associations and outcomes. The significant
strength of this cohort at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham
and Women’s Hospital is that patients remain under the care of
their transplant physicians long-term, creating a cohort with
extended follow up of outcomes after HSCT.
In allogeneic HSCT it is also important to identify subgroups at the
highest VTE risk that might benefit disproportionately from
thromboprophylaxis, recognizing also the potential for harm
associated with anticoagulation due to the higher risk of bleeding
during thrombocytopenia and intestinal inflammation, as well as
drug interactions with anticoagulants and GvHD medications. We
therefore undertook further analyses in this cohort to determine if
conventional VTE risk factors could identify a cohort of patients at
particularly high risk for VTE after HSCT, who could potentially
benefit from VTE prophylaxis.
Methods
Patients
We studied a retrospective cohort of 2276 patients who underwent
first allogeneic HSCT between January 1, 2002 and December 31,
2013 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women’s
Hospital. Patient, transplant, and outcome related factors were
extracted from both the transplantation database and through


medical chart review. Outpatient pharmacy records and subsequent
medical chart review identified patients with VTE on systemic
anticoagulation. This study was approved by the Dana-Farber/
Harvard Cancer Center institutional review board.
Definitions
Venous thromboembolism sites were categorized as lower extremity
deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (LE DVT/PE), upper
extremity and other. LE DVT/PE included PE, symptomatic
proximal or distal lower extremity DVT, and the combination of PE
and DVT, requiring systemic treatment. Upper extremity VTE
included any arm DVT with or without a concurrent central line or
peripherally inserted central catheter in place. Other VTE included
superior vena cava (SVC), pelvic, abdominal, or right-sided
ventricular thrombosis requiring systemic treatment. VTE was
defined as an event confirmed by radiologic imaging (ultrasound,
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan) requiring systemic
anticoagulation that occurred after stem cell infusion (ie., day 0 of
HSCT). Systemic anticoagulation included low-molecular-weight
heparin, warfarin, fondaparinux, and dabigatran. At our center,
patients do not receive systemic thromboprophylaxis at the time of
HSCT due to the expected fall in platelet count. If, however,
patients are re-admitted with normal platelet counts and normal
renal function, the standard of care at our center would include
enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily or unfractionated heparin
5000 units subcutaneously three times a day for VTE prevention.
For systemic therapy of VTE, practitioners at our center manage
anticoagulation. If patients were on warfarin, they were managed
by a central anticoagulation monitoring service. Information on the
duration of anticoagulation and choice of anticoagulant was not
obtained.
Statistical analysis
Patient baseline characteristics were reported descriptively.
Endpoints of interest were overall survival, progression-free
survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality. Overall survival was
defined as the time from stem cell infusion to death from any cause.


Patients who were alive or lost to follow up were censored at the
time last seen alive. Progression-free survival was defined as the
time from stem cell infusion to disease relapse, progression or death
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who were alive
without disease relapse or progression were censored at the time
last seen alive and progression-free. A cumulative incidence curve
of VTE was constructed in the competing risks framework
considering death without developing VTE as a competing event.
All time to events were measured from the date of stem cell
infusion. The analysis is composed of two cohorts: the entire study
population (N=2276) for identifying patient and transplant-related
factors that are associated with post-HSCT VTE; and a subgroup of
patients (N=168) to additionally investigate known VTE risk
factors in depth. For the entire study population (N=2276),
univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis was
performed to examine whether occurrence of VTE was a risk factor
for overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse, non-relapse
mortality, and chronic GvHD. Risk factors considered in
multivariable analysis included age, patient and donor sex
combination, disease risk index (DRI),14 graft source, donor HLA
type, comorbidity index,15 sirolimus use as GvHD prophylaxis,
body mass index (BMI), disease type (myeloid vs. other), acute and
chronic GvHD, and occurrence of VTE. Occurrence of VTE and
acute and chronic GvHD were analyzed as time-dependent
covariates. GvHD had to occur prior to the VTE event to be
considered as a risk factor for VTE. Cox models were stratified by
conditioning intensity because conditioning intensity did not meet
the proportional hazards assumption. To identify potential risk
factors for VTE, univariable and multivariable Cox regression
analysis was utilized. For the subgroup analysis (N=168), we
included all recent VTE events over a fixed time interval from
January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012 (N=56), with a control
cohort of 112 HSCT patients who were randomly selected from 721
patients without VTE in the same transplantation period in a 1:2
ratio between cases and controls. To preserve the ability to test the
association between risk factors and VTE, the control cohort was a
random subset of patients without VTE and not matched on the
characteristics of VTE cases. There were no significant differences in
age, patient sex, donor sex, sex mismatch, BMI, diagnosis, DRI,
donor type, conditioning intensity, cell source, or cytomegalovirus


(CMV) seropositive status between the randomly selected and
nonselected controls (all P-values >0.5). Using this subset of
patients with and without VTE, we additionally collected baseline
conventional risk factors known to be associated with VTE: a past
medical history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, prior
myocardial infarction, prior stroke, and prior VTE. From pharmacy
records, we also collected information on the use of hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) in women from the time of HSCT
onwards.
All analyses were done using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA), and R version 3.2.2 (The Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN) project). Multiplicity was not considered and the
significance level was set to 0.05.
Results
Incidence and Timing of VTE after HSCT
Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2013, 2276 patients
underwent first-time allogeneic HSCT. The median follow-up time
was 50 months (range 4–146) among survivors. Of these patients,
190 (8.3%) developed VTE requiring systemic anticoagulation. The
1- and 2-year cumulative incidence of all VTE were 5.5% (95% CI
4.6–6.5%) and 7.1% (95% CI 6.1–8.2%), respectively, Figure 1.
Amongst the 190 patients who developed VTE, 120 (62.3%) were
LE DVT/PE (45 were PE, 65 were lower extremity DVT and 10 were
both PE and DVT), 57 (30%) were upper extremity (48 had a
catheter in situ at time of thrombosis, 9 had a catheter removed less
than one month prior to arm DVT) and 13 (6.8%) were other VTE
(4 of which were SVC thrombosis). Upper extremity VTE occurred
at a median of 1.3 months (range 0.1–41.1) after HSCT, which was
significantly shorter than LE DVT/PE (9.2 months, range 0.2–72.3)
and other VTE (10.2 months, range 1.1–67.1), P<0.0001 (Figure
2).

Figure 1.Cumulative Incidence of VTE after HSCT. The 1-year


cumulative incidence of any VTE event after HSCT was 5.5% and
the 2-year cumulative incidence was 7.1%, with LE DVT/PE being
the most common type of VTE. DVT/PE: deep vein thrombosis or
pulmonary embolism; VTE: venous thromboembolism.

event after HSCT. Upper extremity VTE occurred at a median of 1.3
months after HSCT, whereas LE DVT/PE occurred at a median of
9.2 months and other VTE at a median of 10.2 months (upper
extremity versus LE DVT/PE and other, P<0.0001). DVT/PE: deep
vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
Platelet count at Time of VTE
Platelet count at time of VTE diagnosis in 176 patients was
established by chart review. In 56 patients with an upper extremity
VTE, the median platelet count at VTE diagnosis was 114.5 × 10/L
(range 14–298), lower than for LE DVT/PE (N=108, median 142×
10/L, range 22–474) and other VTE (N=12, median 192.5 × 10/L,
range 42–473), P=0.0046. The median platelet count at time of
any VTE event was 130.5 × 10/L (range 14–474).
Risk Factors for VTE
Evaluating usual patient, disease and transplant variables, there was
no difference in age, sex, BMI, diagnosis, DRI, conditioning regimen
intensity, donor type (HLA-matched or HLA-mismatched, related or
unrelated, or cord blood), or graft source (bone marrow or
peripheral blood) between allogeneic HSCT recipients with and
without VTE (Table 1).

Table 1.Baseline Characteristics of Patients with and without VTE
after HSCT.
In a multivariable model to identify potential risk factors for VTE,


both acute and chronic GvHD were independently associated with
developing any type of VTE (HR=2.05, 95% CI 1.52–2.76,
P<0.0001 and HR=1.71, 95% CI 1.19–2.46, P=0.0035,
respectively), Table 2. As median time of VTE after HSCT and
platelet count at time of VTE were significantly different for upper
extremity VTE versus other types of VTE, we further performed
multivariate models separating these types of VTE events. When
examining upper extremity VTE only, conditioning regimen
intensity, donor type and acute and chronic GvHD were risk factors
for VTE. When upper extremity VTE was excluded, donor type
(matched unrelated donor (MUD) vs. matched related donor (MRD),
mismatched vs. MRD), myeloid disease and both acute and chronic
GvHD were associated with all other VTE (Table 2).
[image]
Table 2.Multivariable Model of HSCT Variables Associated with
VTE.
In patients who had a VTE after HSCT, 98 patients (51.6%) had
active GvHD on therapy, 28 patients (14.7%) no longer had active
GvHD but remained on therapy, 54 patients (28.4%) were on a
GvHD prophylaxis regimen and 10 patients (5.3%) had no history
of GvHD and were not on immunosuppressive therapy. The most
common immunosuppressive regimens for patients with a VTE were
tacrolimus and prednisone (N=35, 19.3%), tacrolimus and
sirolimus (N=32, 17.7%) and tacrolimus, sirolimus and prednisone
(N=26, 14.4%). In patients who developed GvHD after their first
VTE, 8% had a subsequent VTE event. For patients with active or
previous GvHD at the time of VTE, the most prevalent organ
involved was the skin, including sclerodermatous GvHD (N=83,
65.9%), followed by gastrointestinal GvHD (N=37, 29.4%), ocular
and/or oral GvHD (N=36, 28.6%) and liver GvHD (N=27, 21.4%).
In order to compare conventional VTE risk factors, we performed a
subset case control analysis between HSCT recipients with and
without VTE. The only conventional risk factor associated with a
risk of VTE after HSCT was a prior history of VTE before HSCT. The
incidence of prior VTE was higher in patients who developed VTE
after HSCT: only 10 out of 112 patients (8.9%) without VTE after


HSCT had a prior VTE event, while 12 out of 56 patients (21.4%)
with VTE after HSCT had a prior VTE event (P=0.03, Table 3).

HSCT Recipients.
Clinical Outcomes
In multivariable analysis, any VTE event was associated with
increased non-relapse mortality (HR=1.47; 95% CI 1.08–2.00;
P=0.015), but not with relapse (HR=0.88, 95% CI 0.63–1.23;
P=0.47), progression-free survival (HR=1.13, 95% CI 0.90–1.41;
P=0.29) or overall survival (HR=1.05, 95% CI 0.84–1.31;
P=0.65). Evaluating by site of VTE, upper extremity VTE alone did
not impact any clinical outcome including non-relapse mortality. LE
DVT/PE and other VTE remained significantly associated with non-
relapse mortality (HR=1.71; 95% CI 1.17–2.49; P=0.005). Table 4
summarizes the multivariable models.

Discussion
Venous thromboembolism in cancer is well described, but the
incidence and risk factors after allogeneic HSCT, a presumptively
curative therapy for aggressive hematologic malignancies, is not
well defined. While treating the underlying malignancy with
allogeneic HSCT can reduce the risk of VTE, the study herein
reports that the incidence of VTE post-HSCT remains high. In the
largest allogeneic HSCT cohort evaluated to date with a median
follow up of over 4 years, we demonstrated a very high incidence of
VTE of 8.3%. We found that acute and chronic GvHD were
independent risk factors for developing VTE. A prior history of VTE
was also significantly associated with developing VTE in this cohort


of patients. Lower extremity DVT and PE, as well as VTE in unusual
locations such as splanchnic veins, was associated with an increased
risk of non-relapse mortality (HR=1.71). Although allogeneic HSCT
recipients have a 2.5% incidence of upper extremity VTE (which is
associated with central venous catheters), thrombosis at this site
was not associated with increased non-relapse mortality. Upper
extremity VTE represents a unique cohort of patients with VTE, as
evidenced by the shorter time to VTE after HSCT which reflects that
these events were due to central venous catheter placement
routinely used during conditioning chemotherapy and HSCT at our
center. The lower platelet count observed with upper extremity VTE
also likely reflects the early timeframe when VTE was diagnosed in
this cohort, reflecting that these patients were still undergoing
platelet recovery after HSCT.
Prior to this study, the largest cohort examining VTE in HSCT
recipients by Gerber and colleagues reported that 4.6% of patients
developed VTE,10 but that study differs significantly from our
analysis as it includes patients treated with autologous transplant
who were excluded from our cohort. Gerber’s study also included
mainly myeloablative conditioning, which differs from our report in
which about 60% of patients received reduced intensity
conditioning. One could hypothesize that myeloablative
conditioning may increase the incidence of VTE due to more
vascular endothelial damage, veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and
organ toxicity, but this was not the case in our multivariate models
for VTE risk. Conditioning intensity was only associated with upper
extremity VTE, perhaps because patients receiving myeloablative
conditioning are more likely to have an indwelling central line for a
longer time.
In the study herein, GvHD was independently associated with VTE
after HSCT. We postulate that GvHD does indeed induce a pro-
inflammatory state which likely makes patients more prone to VTE.
As this was a database study, we were limited by the data collected
and did not have enough information regarding GvHD therapy or
immobilization. Of note, we did see a high incidence of skin GvHD
(65%) in patients who developed VTE which could be due to a
decreased mobility of limbs and possible impact on venous return.
This is merely hypothesis generating at this point and as such


requires a prospective analysis of VTE after HSCT.
The limitations of our study are related to the constraints of
database research and our reliance on outpatient pharmacy records
to identify patients on anticoagulation who were then assessed for
VTE. The incidence of VTE captured may therefore be an
underestimation of the true rate of VTE. Patients who had an
inpatient thrombotic episode but were not treated as an outpatient
would have been missed, although this number is likely to be small,
as most patients receive a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation
which is generally longer than hospital admissions for HSCT
recipients. Patients who had contraindications to anticoagulation,
such as thrombocytopenia, would also have been missed. While our
overall incidence of VTE at 8.3% is high, this may be an
underestimation given the aforementioned limitations in identifying
all cases, reinforcing the message that VTE is a prevalent and
concerning complication after allogeneic HSCT. Variables that could
not be formally addressed in this analysis included incidence of
VOD and cause of death.
In an effort to assess for VTE risk factors, we evaluated both
standard HSCT and VTE related variables, and also evaluated
sirolimus use in the multivariate analysis. Patients receive sirolimus
either as GvHD prophylaxis or treatment. There is literature
suggesting that the use of sirolimus is associated with vascular
disruption, possibly leading to more vascular complications such as
VTE.1816 In our analysis, we did not find an association between
sirolimus and VTE incidence, suggesting that GvHD itself, and not
treatment with sirolimus, is the risk factor for developing VTE. We
do however recognize that the number of patients in each of the
GvHD prophylaxis/therapeutic categories is small, and thus this
analysis is likely not sufficiently powered to draw any firm
conclusions regarding the impact of immunosuppressive
medications on the risk of VTE in HSCT.
Although we documented an increased risk of VTE after HSCT, it is
difficult to make recommendations about routine
thromboprophylaxis without further study. Current CHEST
guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized patients
with a VTE risk greater than 10%,19 while the International Society


on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines recommend that
patients with a Khorana risk score of 3 or more and a VTE risk of
about 7%, receive thromboprophylaxis,20 as the high rates of VTE
justify the risk of bleeding from anticoagulation in these patient
groups. In our population, the cumulative 1-year and 2-year
incidence of VTE in all allogeneic HSCT patients was 5.5% and
7.1%, respectively, which would be within the range of the current
recommendations. For patients with normal platelet counts, no
additional bleeding risk, active GvHD and prior history of VTE,
thromboprophylaxis could be considered. Carefully designed
prospective interventional trials of thromboprophylaxis after
allogeneic HSCT are needed, targeting the subsets of patients that
we have identified as being at the highest risk of VTE.
