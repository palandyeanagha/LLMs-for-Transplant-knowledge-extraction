Abstract
Objective We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of pulmonary aspergillosis associated with
interstitial pneumonia.
Methods We reviewed the medical records of all patients treated for interstitial pneumonia with or without
pulmonary aspergillosis at our institution between April 2006 and August 2012 and evaluated the clinical fea￾tures as well as risk and prognostic factors for pulmonary aspergillosis associated with interstitial pneumonia.
Results Among 539 patients with interstitial pneumonia, 15 who suffered from pulmonary aspergillosis
were identified. The median age was 69.2±7.0 years, and fourteen patients were men. The subtypes of pul￾monary aspergillosis were chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (n=14) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (n=
1). The forms of interstitial pneumonia included idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n=9), rheumatoid arthritis￾related interstitial pneumonia (n=4) and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (n=2). The underlying conditions
were emphysema (n=9) and a history of oral corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive use (n=4). Home oxy￾gen therapy (HOT) was administered in 11 patients. Following the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, all
patients were treated with antifungal drugs. Ten patients (66.6%) died. A comparison of the interstitial pneu￾monia patients with and without pulmonary aspergillosis showed that the presence of emphysema, use of
HOT and death were significantly associated with pulmonary aspergillosis.
Conclusion Pulmonary aspergillosis is one of the major complications of interstitial pneumonia and its
prognosis is poor. Therefore, providing careful monitoring and proper treatment is extremely important.

Introduction
Aspergillus is a mold spread by aerosols of spores. The
organism is ubiquitous and saprophytic in nature, being
commonly found in water, soil, and organic debris. Follow￾ing inhalation, the conidia may be promptly destroyed by
host defense mechanisms, colonize the conducting airways
or cavities, or invade and destroy host tissues (1, 2). Pulmo￾nary aspergillosis is classified into invasive pulmonary as￾pergillosis (IPA), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and
allergic forms of aspergillosis (3). IPA occurs primarily in
severely immunocompromised patients, including those with
neutropenia, a history of hematopoietic stem-cell transplan￾tation, solid-organ transplantation or prolonged and/or high￾dose corticosteroid treatment. IPA rapidly progresses, and
the mortality rate is high (2, 3). CPA is a locally invasive
disease often found in patients with chronic lung disease or
mild immunodeficiency. Affected patients usually have an
underlying pulmonary disease involving the destruction of
lung tissue. CPA may also occur in patients who are mildly
immunocompromised due to diabetes mellitus, alcoholism,
chronic liver disease or the use of low-dose corticosteroid
therapy (2, 3). Common underlying pulmonary diseases in￾clude chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and previous
pulmonary tuberculosis (4, 5). There is also a potential risk

for pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with interstitial pneu￾monia, although reports of these cases are few (6, 7). There￾fore, we conducted a retrospective study of patients diag￾nosed with pulmonary aspergillosis associated with intersti￾tial pneumonia over the last six years in order to investigate
the clinical features of this condition.
Materials and Methods
We reviewed the medical records of all patients treated
for interstitial pneumonia with or without pulmonary asper￾gillosis at our institution between April 2006 and August
2012 at Jichi Medical University. We classified interstitial
pneumonia into two types: idiopathic interstitial pneumonia
(IIP) and non-IIP. To diagnose IIP, we used the American
Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)
consensus classification (8). In patients with histological evi￾dence, the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was dependent
on pathological findings (i.e., surgical specimens, necropsy
or autopsy). In patients without histological evidence, the di￾agnosis was based on the findings of high-resolution com￾puted tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest, medical his￾tory taking and physical examinations. Interstitial pneumonia
was diagnosed based on the detection of bilateral honey￾combing or reticular or ground-glass opacity predominantly
in the peripheral, subpleural or bilateral lungs on CT im￾ages. The diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was further
confirmed by some of the authors prior to study commence￾ment, and patients with sarcoidosis were excluded. Among
the cases of pulmonary aspergillosis, the incidence of IPA
and CPA was analyzed. IPA was diagnosed according to the
European Organization for the Research and Treatment of
Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria (9); proven
IPA cases were included in this study. The diagnosis of CPA
was made according to the following criteria (including
probable disease) (2, 10, 11): (i) clinical symptoms lasting
for >1 month caused by pulmonary aspergillosis (at least
one of the following: fever, coughing, sputum production,
hemoptysis and dyspnea) and elevated levels of inflamma￾tory markers (the C-reactive protein level and white blood
cell count); (ii) chest radiologic findings (cavitary lesions,
fungus balls, consolidation, pleural thickening); and (iii) the
isolation of Aspergillus species via culture or the presence
of pathological proof obtained from a respiratory sample
(i.e., sputum, samples obtained via bronchoscopy) and/or a
positive serum Aspergillus precipitin test (Aspergillus￾precipitating antibody test performed according to the
Ouchterlony method and/or an Aspergillus galactomannan
antigen test). The Aspergillus-precipitating antibody tests
were performed by SRL, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) using an As￾pergillus immunodiffusion system (Microgen Bioproducts
Ltd., Camberley, UK). The tests were judged to be positive
if immunoelectrophoresis showed at least one distinct pre￾cipitation arc. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen tests were
also performed by SRL, Inc. using the platelia Aspergillus
enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la￾Coquette, France), with a cut-off index set at 1.0. Patients
diagnosed with CPA satisfied all of the above criteria (i-iii),
while those diagnosed with IPA, allergic forms of aspergillo￾sis and simple aspergilloma were excluded.
We evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory find￾ings, radiologic findings and pulmonary function test results.
Laboratory tests included Krebs von den Lugen-6 (KL-6),
surfactant protein D (SP-D) and (1→3) β-D glucan assays
in addition to the Aspergillus precipitin test. The β-D glucan
assay was carried out according to the MK method (20 pg/
mL cut-off value; Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Radiologic examinations included chest radiography and CT.
Treatment protocols and outcomes were also reviewed. In
addition, we investigated risk and prognostic factors by
comparing the cases of interstitial pneumonia with and with￾out pulmonary aspergillosis. All data are expressed as the
mean (±SD) or median (range). Categorical variables were
compared using Fisher’s exact test or Student’s t-test. A p
value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi￾cance. This study was approved by the ethics committee of
Jichi Medical University Hospital. Informed consent was not
required due to the retrospective study design.
Results
Patient characteristics
The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Among the patients with interstitial pneumonia, we identi￾fied 320 cases of IIP (176 cases of idiopathic pulmonary fi￾brosis/usual interstitial pneumonia) and 219 cases of non-IIP
(136 cases of collagen vascular disease related-interstitial
pneumonia). A total of 15 patients suffered from pulmonary
aspergillosis associated with interstitial pneumonia, with a
median age of 69.2±7.0 years. Fourteen patients were men
and one patient was a woman. All 15 patients were either
current smokers or ex-smokers. The subtypes of pulmonary
aspergillosis were as follows: 14 patients had CPA and one
patient had IPA. Three forms of interstitial pneumonia were
detected: nine patients had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), four patients had
rheumatoid arthritis-related interstitial pneumonia (RA-IP)
and two patients had pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
(PPFE). The period from the diagnosis of interstitial pneu￾monia to the detection of pulmonary aspergillosis was 44.0±
37.8 months. As for underlying systemic conditions other
than interstitial pneumonia or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we
detected emphysema in nine patients, a history of oral corti￾costeroid and/or immunosuppressive use in four patients,
liver cirrhosis in two patients, diabetes mellitus in two pa￾tients, post-lobectomy of lung cancer in one patient and
post-subtotal resection of stomach cancer in one patient. Of
those who received steroids and/or immunosuppressive
agents, three patients were treated for RA with a daily pred-

nisolone dose of 2 mg (over two years), 5 mg (over five
years) and 7.5 mg (over three years), respectively, all of
whom developed CPA. The remaining patient was also
treated with 10 mg of cyclosporine daily in addition to 7.5
mg of prednisolone. On the other hand, one patient was
treated with high doses of steroids and immunosuppressive
agents due to the severity of IPF and developed IPA. The
patient was administered 17.5 mg of prednisolone and 90
mg of cyclosporine per day for over eight months (the ther￾apy began with steroid pulse treatment with subsequent oral
prednisolone at a dose of 60 mg daily, which was gradually
reduced to 17.5 mg daily). At the time of diagnosis, all pa￾tients presented with at least one of the following clinical
symptoms: cough in 10 patients, sputum production in eight
patients, dyspnea in seven patients, hemoptysis in five pa￾tients and fever in two patients.
Laboratory findings
Serum Aspergillus-precipitating antibody tests were per￾formed in 14 patients (all with CPA), 12 of whom had posi￾tive results. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen tests were
performed in all patients, three of whom exhibited a score
above 1.0 (index). Aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing
of the two CPA patients who tested negative on the
Aspergillus-precipitating antibody test revealed scores of 1.1
and 2.4, respectively, and the one patient who did not re￾ceive an antibody test was diagnosed based on pathological
proof at autopsy (proven IPA). β-D glucan assays were per￾formed in 15 patients, four of whom exhibited results above
20 pg/mL. Aspergillus cultures and/or pathologic proof were
positive in five patients: two patients were found to have As￾pergillus fumigatus, while the details of Aspergillus species
in the other three patients were unknown. The median KL-6
level (normal range, <500 U/mL) at 566±239 U/mL was
elevated, as was that of SP-D (normal range, <110 ng/mL)
at 138±84.8 ng/mL.

six of whom were found to have a restrictive disorder (per￾cent vital capacity <80%). In addition, home oxygen therapy
(HOT) was initially administered in four patients, and fol￾lowed by the addition of seven patients.
Chest CT findings
The CT findings are summarized in Table 2. The CT find￾ings showed cavitary lesions in 12 patients, pleural thicken￾ing in 10 patients, fungus balls in 10 patients and consolida￾tion in nine patients. The shadows of Aspergillus infection
included bullous and/or emphysematous lesions in eight pa￾tients (Fig. 1), honeycombing in four patients (Fig. 2) and
upper lobe fibroelastosis in two patients with PPFE. A
shadow of Aspergillus infection was found in the postopera￾tive cavity in one patient. Nine patients had emphysema, in
particular those with predominantly upper lobe emphysema,
including bullous paraseptal changes distributed in the upper
lobes. Of the nine patients with emphysema, upper lobe
bullous infection with Aspergillus was detected in seven
cases and honeycombing was detected in two cases. The site
of Aspergillus infection was the upper lobe in nine patients,
the lower lobe in four patients and both the upper and lower
lobes in two patients.
Treatments and outcomes
The treatments and outcomes are summarized in Table 3.
Following the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, all pa￾tients were treated with antifungal drugs. Oral itraconazole
was administered in six patients (14.8±8.0 months), oral
voriconazole was administered in five patients (6.4±5.5
months) and both were administered in three patients due to
side effects (two patients were treated with itraconazole after
voriconazole for approximately two months and 10 months,
respectively, while one patient was treated vice versa for
over five years). Meanwhile, intravenous micafungin was
administered in one patient who had IPA (Fig. 3). At the
end of therapy or follow-up, the conditions of six patients
had improved, while those of eight patients had worsened
and that of one patient did not change. Ten patients (66.6%)
died. The cause of death in these 10 patients was as follows:
pulmonary aspergillosis in four patients, bacterial pneumonia
in two patients, gradual worsening of interstitial pneumonia
in two patients, heart failure in one patient and acute respi￾ratory failure in one patient. Since the patient with IPA died
within one week, the mortality rate of CPA was 64.2% (9/
14), with an observation period of 21.4±16.2 months. No
patients were changed from oral to intravenous antifungal
drugs. Surgical treatment was also not performed due to an
impaired pulmonary function, hypoxic state or poor general
status. In addition, a comparison between survivors and non￾survivors showed that a higher proportion of patients who
died had an increased KL-6 level and emphysema, whereas
the type of antifungal drug and use of HOT were not sig￾nificantly different between the two groups (Table 4).
Risk and prognostic factors
The results of the comparison of the cases of interstitial
pneumonia with and without pulmonary aspergillosis, as
summarized in Table 5, showed that the presence of emphy￾sema, use of HOT and death were significantly associated
with pulmonary aspergillosis, while the use of steroids and/
or immunosuppressive agents was not.
Discussion
This study investigated the clinical features of 15 patients
who suffered from pulmonary aspergillosis associated with
interstitial pneumonia and evaluated risk and prognostic fac￾tors. In this study, of the 15 patients, 14 had CPA and one
had IPA. The one patient with IPA was diagnosed based on
an autopsy lung specimen showing lung parenchyma inva￾sion with necrosis and pulmonary artery invasion due to As￾pergillus hyphae. The diagnosis of CPA in this study was
made according to criteria similar to those recommended by
Kousha et al. (2), Denning et al. (10) and Kohno et al. (11).
As for the serum Aspergillus precipitin tests, the Aspergillus
antigen has been shown to be an excellent serum marker for
diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (12). However, for the di￾agnosis of CPA, the Aspergillus-precipitating antibody test is

this study, therefore, platelia Aspergillus EIA test results
were added to the diagnostic criteria for diagnosing CPA in
cases involving a negative Aspergillus antibody test. The
cut-off level was set at an index of 1.0 in order to avoid
false-positive results (11). In this study, only two CPA pa-

tients had both a negative Aspergillus-precipitating antibody
test and positive platelia Aspergillus EIA test (see Results).
In addition, the rate of positivity for both Aspergillus galac￾tomannan antigens and β-D glucan was low. These results
support the findings of a previous report showing low rates
of positivity for both of these tests in CPA patients (13).
Emphysema was found in 9/15 patients; the radiologic
findings on HRCT in these cases demonstrated upper lobe
emphysema and lower lobe interstitial fibrotic changes.
These characteristic radiologic findings are considered to re￾flect so-called combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema
(CPFE), as proposed by Cottin et al. (14, 15). Of the pa￾tients diagnosed with CPFE, upper lobe bullous infection
with Aspergillus was detected in more patients than honey￾combing. In addition, a comparison of the cases of intersti￾tial pneumonia with and without pulmonary aspergillosis
showed the presence of emphysema to be a risk factor for
pulmonary aspergillosis. The features of PPFE include sub￾pleural upper lobe fibrosis without honeycombing and a
slowly progressive clinical course similar to that of chronic
idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (16, 17). PPFE is also
called pulmonary apical fibrocystic disease (18) or idi￾opathic pulmonary upper lobe fibrosis (19). Bullous or em￾physematous lesions, honeycombing and upper lobe fibro￾elastosis constitute destructive changes in lung tissue that
are likely to result in infection with Aspergillus due to dis￾turbed local clearance.
In the present study, steroid and/or immunosuppressive
use was not found to be a significant risk factor for pulmo￾nary aspergillosis. However, steroid therapy inhibits the kill￾ing of conidia and hyphae by macrophages and the migra￾tion of neutrophils around the fungus (1, 20, 21). Three
CPA patients in this study were treated for long periods
(over two years) with prednisolone, although the dose was
low, under 7.5 mg daily. On the other hand, one IPA patient
was treated with high doses of steroids and immunosuppres￾sives. Therefore, patients treated with steroid therapy require
special attention regarding the potential for Aspergillus in￾fection.
Following the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, all
patients were administered antifungal drugs. Treating IPA
remains difficult, and the mortality rate continues to be
high (2). For the primary treatment of IPA according to the
guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America
(IDSA), intravenous or oral voriconazole is recommended in
most patients (3). Echinocandins, such as micafungin, can
be considered as alternative or salvage therapy (3). Success￾ful treatment of IPA depends on the ability to obtain an
early diagnosis and provide prompt treatment, as any delay
is associated with a high mortality rate (20). Therefore,
treatment should be initiated empirically without waiting for
a definitive diagnosis in patients suspected of having IPA.
The IPA patient in this study was first treated empirically
with micafungin once he was suspected of having pulmo￾nary aspergillosis. However, respiratory failure rapidly de￾veloped, resulting in death within one week due to IPA;
thus, we should have considered voriconazole treatment ear￾lier. As for the treatment of CPA according to the IDSA

Intern Med 53: 1299-1306, 2014 DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.53.1578
1305
guidelines, oral therapy with voriconazole or itraconazole is
recommended as the primary treatment (3). In recent reports
of CPA patients treated with voriconazole or itraconazole,
the mortality rate was documented to be 51% by Nam et
al. (22) and 50% by Ohba et al. (23). In the present study,
the mortality rate of CPA was higher than that observed in
the above two reports, and a diagnosis of pulmonary asper￾gillosis was shown to be a poor prognostic factor. The com￾parison of the survivors and non-survivors showed signifi￾cant differences, not in the type of antifungal drugs adminis￾tered, but rather in the KL-6 level and the presence of em￾physema. Moreover, more patients received HOT, although
this trend was not statistically significant and the use of
HOT was found to be a risk factor for pulmonary aspergillo￾sis; therefore, these patients’ respiratory condition was likely
related to their poor prognosis. With regard to surgical treat￾ment, none of the CPA patients underwent surgery due to an
impaired pulmonary function, hypoxic state and/or poor
general status. However, changing from oral to intravenous
antifungal drugs should have been considered, as intrave￾nous antifungal drugs have been reported to be more effec￾tive in CPA patients (3, 11).
There are some limitations to the present study, including
the retrospective design and the small number of patients
who suffered from pulmonary aspergillosis associated with
interstitial pneumonia. In addition, the selection of treatment
was based on the judgment of the treating physician. More￾over, the rate of positivity of mycological proof was low at
33.3% (5/15), although the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergil￾losis was made according to commonly used criteria.
In conclusion, in this study, among the patients with pul￾monary aspergillosis associated with interstitial pneumonia,
most had emphysema (9/15), which was considered to re￾flect CPFE, in which bullous and/or emphysematous lesions
are more likely to be infected with Aspergillus and are re￾lated to a poor prognosis. Patients with RA and interstitial
pneumonia are frequently treated with steroids and immuno￾suppressive agents, and we found that low-dose treatment
with such drugs may have contributed to the development of
Aspergillus infection in our study population. Moreover, we
found that the patient who suffered from severe interstitial
pneumonia and had been treated with high-dose steroids and
immunosuppressive therapy developed IPA and died early.
Despite the administration of antifungal treatment in all pa￾tients following the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, the
prognoses were poor and the mortality rate was high. Pul￾monary aspergillosis is a major complication of interstitial
pneumonia, and it is extremely important to properly moni￾tor and treat affected patients due to the poor prognosis of
the disease.
The authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).
