Abstract
Background: Rats are widely used in modeling orthotopic lung transplantation. Recently the introduction of the
cuff technique has greatly facilitated the anastomosing procedure used during the transplant. However, the
procedure is still associated with several drawbacks including twisting of blood vessels, tissue injury and the
extensive time required for the procedure. This study was performed to optimize the model of rat lung
transplantation (LT) with the cuff technique.
Methods: A total of 42 adult Lewis rats received orthotopic LT with our newly modified procedures. The modified
procedures were based on the traditional procedure and incorporated improvements involving orotracheal intubation;
a cuff without a tail; conservative dissection in the hilum; preservation of the left lung during anastomosis; successive
anatomizing of the bronchus, the pulmonary vein, and the pulmonary artery; and one operator.
Results: Transplants were performed in 42 rats with a successful rate of 95.23% (40/42). The mean duration for the
complete procedure was 82.93 ± 14.56 minutes. All anastomoses were completed in one attempt without vessel
laceration, twisting or angulation. In our study, two animals died within three days and one animal died ten days after
the operation. All grafts were well inflated with robust blood perfusion and functioned normally as demonstrated by
blood gas analysis.
Conclusions: We have developed a modified orthotopic LT technique that can be easily performed while overcoming
major drawbacks. The modified technique has many advantages, such as easy graft implanting, shortened operation
time, fewer complications and high reproducibility.

Background
Lung transplantation (LT) is an established therapy for a
variety of end-stage pulmonary diseases. According to the
report from The Registry of the International Society for
Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in 2010, more
than 2700 lung and heart-lung transplantations are
performed annually [1]. The overall survival rate after
transplantation is currently 79% at one year and about 52%
at five years [1]. However, most immune and non-immune
mechanisms that complicate the following pathophysio￾logical processes remain poorly understood. Accordingly,
many experimental LT models are employed to develop
novel preventative and therapeutic strategies [2-6].
Orthotopic LT in an animal model is a procedure that
simulates human LT, including rejection, infection and is￾chemia/reperfusion processes, which can offer much more
information for transplantation research. By far, the rat
has been one of the more promising candidates employed
for LT since first performed in 1971 [7], especially after
Mizuta’s cuff technique and a variety of its modifications
were introduced in 1989 and later [6,8-11]. We previously
established a rat LT model with a modified cuff technique.
In our experience there were several disadvantages asso￾ciated with this procedure, such as the twisting of blood
vessels or bronchus and the time required. Recently, we
attempted to optimize and modify the previously esta￾blished cuff model. Our improvements in procedure allow

easy handling, a shortened operation time, fewer compli￾cations and high reproducibility.
Methods
Animals
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal
Research Committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical
school, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
All animals received adequate care in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. Male inbred Lewis rats were pur￾chased from Hunan Slac Laboratory Animal Company,
Ltd (Changsha,Hunan Province, P.R. China). Eight-to-ten￾week-old animals weighing 250 to 300 g were used as both
donors and recipients. A total of 42 orthotopic LTs were
performed in the study.
Surgical technique
All surgical procedures were performed with sterile tech￾niques in the barrier system of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology. An SXP-1C operating micro￾scope with 10x magnification (Shanghai Medical Instru￾ments Company, Ltd, Shanghai, P.R. China.) was used
for both donor and recipient operations. Animals were
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of so￾dium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Shanghai, P.R. China.). Rats were orotracheal intubated
with a 16 G angiocatheter and were connected to a
ventilator (Shanghai Alcott Biotech Company, Ltd.,
Shanghai, P.R. China) for respiration assistance with room
air and a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg at 85 breaths/minute.
The donor rat was placed in a supine position and a
median laparo-sternotomy was performed to expose
heart and lungs. The left atrial appendage was cut and
lungs were flushed with 20 ml cold (4°C) heparinized
LPD (Perfadex™, Addmedica, Paris, France) from the root
of the pulmonary artery. The semi-inflated left lung was
harvested at end-tidal volume. Its bronchus, pulmonary
vein and pulmonary artery were passed through a 14 G,
16 G, and 18 G cuff without tail respectively, with their
proximal ends being everted over the cuff and circumfer￾entially fixed.
Recipients were placed in the right lateral decubitus.
Left thoracotomy was performed through the fifth inter￾costal space and the left lung was retracted laterally out of
the thoracic cavity to expose the hilum. The beginning of
the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein were sepa￾rated from the bronchus. Thus freeing spaces between
them were acquired, where the blood flow was occluded
and the anastomosis was finished. Because the pulmonary
vein was vulnerable to laceration, dissection was carried
out as close to mediastinum as possible and the overlying
connective tissues were preserved to antagonize tension
and to protect stomas. The three structures in the hilum
were individually blocked with slip knots and 7–0 nylon
circumferential ligatures were positioned loosely around

them. Distal from them, short incisions were made on the
anterior wall of the bronchus and the vessels. From which,
bronchus, vein and artery cuffs of the donor lung were
placed in sequence into the equivalent recipient structures
and secured with prepared ligatures (Figure 1A).
The whole procedure was a modification of the trad￾itional method. The differences between the procedures
are listed in Table 1.
Vital signs
We sampled three LTs to acquire the circulation para￾meters during operation. The recipient rat was placed in
a supine position. Skin in the right groin was prepared
and incised. The right common femoral artery was iso￾lated and controlled by arterial clamp. A 24 G angio￾catheter (BD Medical Company, Lt, Suzhou, Jiangsu
Province, P.R. China)was used to access the artery under
visualization and was connected to a transducer for
blood pressure measuring. Blood pressure was continu￾ously monitored and recorded by PowerLab data acqui￾sition systems (ADinstruments,Shanghai, P.R. China).
Data were processed and analyzed with LabChart Pro
software (ADinstruments).
Functional graft assessment
Blood gas analysis was performed to assess the lung graft
function. At the time of sacrifice on postoperative day 7,
the right lung pulmonary hilum was occluded for ten
minutes. Two samples of blood were drawn from the left
atrium pre-occlusion and post-occlusion respectively.
PaO2 and PaCO2 were measured on a FiO2 of 0.21. In
addition, photographs were taken on day 7 after lung
transplantation to evaluate changes in the chest cavity.
Histology
Transplanted lungs were harvested after pulmonary flush￾ing with normal saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, sec￾tioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Grading
for rejection pathology was performed by a pathologist
using standard criteria developed by the Lung Rejection
Study Group [12].
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 13.0
software (Chicago, IL, USA). Data were reported as
means ± SD and compared with paired t test. P values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Outcomes
We performed 42 transplants with a success rate of
95.23%. Two animals died of bleeding and pulmonary vein
injury during the operation. Another two animals died
within three days after the operation and one died on
postoperative day 10. All remaining animals were eutha￾nized on the day of our predetermined end point of the
study. The whole procedure was performed in 82.93 ±
14.56 minutes and the relevant periods of procedure times
are listed in Table 2. All the anastomoses were completed
in one attempt. Some common complications such as ves￾sel laceration, twisting and angulation that occur in trad￾itional procedures were not observed.
Vital signs
Generally, vital signs of the recipients were stable for the
entire operation procedure, with the exception of two tran￾sient hypotensive episodes. These were observed at the be￾ginning of mechanical ventilation but subsequently normal

pressure returned gradually and the period of hilum block￾ing recovered with the reperfusion of graft (Figure 2).
Functional graft assessment
Exploration on postoperative day 7 showed that the grafts
were well inflated with a robust blood supply (Figure 3).
Postoperative chest radiography illustrated the graft was
well inflated and blood gas analysis demonstrated normal
function (Table 3).
Histology
The hematoxylin and eosin (H.E) stain of recipient lung
section showed lung injury of alveolar exudation, septa
edema and interstitial infiltration on postoperative day 3.
However, those lesions disappeared on postoperative day
7, indicating recovery from ischemia-reperfusion lung in￾jury sustained in the first 3 days posttransplant (Figure 4).
Discussion
Orthotopic LT in rats challenges surgeons greatly for its
all-around demands, such as well sensation of microma￾nipulation under microscope, good performance during
operation, precise collaboration between surgeons and
intensive care after transplant. Therefore, a simple and
easy-to-perform model with high reproducibility is of
great importance. Although the Mizuta’s cuff technique
greatly facilitates anastomosis during the operation,
many drawbacks remain. For example, vessels and bron￾chus are likely to twist during the procedure, and the
pulmonary vein is vulnerable to laceration during anasto￾mosis. Our experience shows that the modified technique
we adopted has fewer complications and improved out￾comes. Compared with our previous study, the whole pro￾cedure could be executed easily by one instead of two
surgeons. Although this reflects the learning curve of the
model to some extent, its high reproducibility and low in￾cidence of mortality indeed illustrate the rationality of
these improvements.
Minitracheostomy is a reliable method of guaranteeing
undisturbed intubation and ventilation. However, it is time￾consuming and traumatic. For those laboratory animals
that will be euthanatized at the end of experiment, it is an
acceptable method. But for the study of lung transplant￾ation, acute rejection often happens within the first post￾operative week and studies of chronic rejection require a
longer observation period. Infection, scarring and even

stenosis in trachea following tracheostomy might confound
the interpretation of experimental data due to its potential
impact on lung function of the recipient. Another disad￾vantage of tracheostomy is the inconvenience of postopera￾tive care. We previously observed that rats undergoing
tracheostomy often had difficulty breathing as demon￾strated by inspiratory and expiratory stridor, which accom￾panied a high mortality during the first three days after
operation. But in this study, animals demonstrated steady
breathing and recovered rapidly during the early postopera￾tive period. Accordingly, we translated tracheostomy into
orotracheal intubation after operation and intensive post￾operative care was needed for those animals. Clear expo￾sure of the glottis is the most important step in the
orotracheal intubation. According to our experience, as
long as the rat head is flexed back to keep the chest, neck
and lower jaw in a straight line, which provides a moderate
stretch to the rat tongue, the glottis of the rat is easily
visualized.
A traditional cuff consists of a body 1.5 mm in length
and a tail 1 mm in length [8]. Its tail is designed for the
convenience of cuff setting and inserting. However, in
addition to the foreign-body reaction and fibrous formation
caused by this kind of cuff, it also occupies more space.
Therefore, a relatively longer length of the bronchus or
vascular vessels needs to be dissected during the oper￾ation, otherwise the lung tissue in the hilum would be
compressed and even injured by the cuff tail. Further￾more, when the vascular cuff is prepared, its orientation
should be taken into consideration during anastomosis.
Vessel twisting or angulation related to inappropriate
placement of cuff could affect the flow of pulmonary cir￾culation, which then would cause graft ischemia or con￾gestion. In this study, the cuff tail was removed, but we
could hold any point of the cuff body and make slight
adjustments when necessary, which effectively avoided the
twisting of vessels or bronchus without increasing diffi￾culty of implantation. Because our cuffs were cut from
smooth angiocatheters, everted tissue on the surface was
inclined to slip out because of tension from the graft dur￾ing delivery. Although roughening the cuff with sandpaper
and everting more tissue could prevent detachment, the
apical segmental bronchus and left upper pulmonary vein
would be affected because they originated from the prox￾imal trunk. Focal imbalance of ventilation/perfusion would
in turn occur for the reason of their stenosis or occlusion.
To overcome these disadvantages, we created a nick 0.2
mm to one end, where cuffs were circumferentially ligated.
Thus, only a small amount of tissue is required to be
everted but it remains well-fixed.
The main cause of death in operation is hemorrhage,
which is most often caused by the tearing of the pulmonary
vein. As a result, preventive procedures must be performed
to avoid this disastrous event. In our previous study, we
routinely removed the native lung to make sufficient space
in the chest cavity and we preserved enough length of
proximal blood vessel for anastomosis. The main proce￾dures were done in the small chest cavity, which is incon￾venient. Furthermore, a pull-out force should be exerted
for exposition and cuff inserting, which cannot be done
without assistance. During these procedures, thin-walled
vessels may be torn due to carelessness or miscoordination
between surgeons, especially in the area adjacent to the
lung parenchyma. Accordingly, sophisticated techniques,
repeated practice, and precise collaboration are required.
During this new procedure, the native lung was preserved
and laterally retracted out of the thoracic cavity until anas￾tomosis was finished. Consequently, the mediastinum
shifted to the left and the hilum was exposed superficially.
Those modifications allowed for better visualization and
made dissection and anastomosis easier.

Among the three hilar structures, the pulmonary vein is
vulnerable as a result of its anatomic character [10]. Pre￾serving its overlying connective tissues to antagonize ten￾sion during anastomosis could help to prevent accidental
laceration and protect stomas. Our experience showed
that conservative dissection near the mediastinum and
the creation of these two small free spaces yielded suffi￾cient space for ligation and anastomosis. Accordingly, it is
unnecessary to thoroughly isolate the hilum during re￾cipient procedure. In addition, successive anastomosing
of artery, bronchus and vein respectively, or in a reverse
order with the intention of protecting the vein, was
adopted by different researchers [8,13]. But those proce￾dures have a potential risk of vessel twisting. To improve
this, we anastomosed the bronchus first, followed by vein,
and then artery. The advantage of this modification is that
the wide lumen and thick wall of bronchus is convenient
for cuff inserting and fixation. The circumferential liga￾ture between cartilage rings on the cuff will secure the
firm fixation of the graft, enabling it to resist tension
during the following procedure. More importantly, the
anastomosed bronchus constitutes a major part of the
three-dimensional structure of hilum, which was used to
guide insertion of vessels. The pulmonary vein and artery
cuff were easily placed into their equivalent structure
while in their natural state. Therefore, no twisting oc￾curred in our study.
In order to prevent injury to the bronchial and vascu￾lar wall, an incision is made only on the anterior wall of
the one-third of the bronchus and vessel of the recipi￾ent. If the incision is not long enough, the surgeon can
cut the incision into a ‘├’shape towards the recipient
hilum. The operator uses his left hand to lift the front
wall of the recipient bronchial-vascular structures to ex￾pose the lumen and uses his right hand to hold the
donor’s bronchial-vascular structures, inserting them into
the recipient’s lumen through the incision in the wall
mediastinally. Thus, this superficial modification makes it
easy for the surgeon to perform LT without an assistant.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our modified procedure could further fa￾cilitate graft implanting, reduce operating time and in￾crease reproducibility in a rat LT model.
