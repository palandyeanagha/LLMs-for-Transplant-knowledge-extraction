Abstract
Aims-To assess which pathological fea￾tures are associated with a sensitive
marker of liver fibrogenesis and thus of
the potential development of fibrosis in
hepatitis C.
Methods-The degree ofliver fibrogenesis
was evaluated by quantification of type I
collagen mRNA and transforming growth
factor (TGF) P1 mRNA (a major profibro￾genic cytokine) in liver biopsy specimens
from 28 patients with chronic hepatitis C
and five controls, using a quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results of
mRNA quantification were correlated
with histological lesions scored semiquan￾titatively in the same specimens.
Results-Type I collagen mRNA was more
strongly expressed in patients than in con￾trols and correlated with the degree of
fibrosis, but not with any of the necro￾inflammatory lesions (portal inflamma￾tion, piecemeal necrosis, and lobular
necrosis). TGF1l mRNA concentration
was higher in patients than in controls and
correlated with histological grade ofactiv￾ity and lobular necrosis. This result was
confirmed by in situ hybridisation experi￾ments which showed that TGFf1 mRNA
was mainly expressed in areas of focal
lobular necrosis in chronic hepatitis C.
Conclusion-This study shows that fibro￾sis, rather than necro-inflammatory le￾sions or activity scores, is associated with
fibrogenesis and thus with potential ag￾gravation of the fibrous deposit in chronic
hepatitis C. Lobular necrosis is an impor￾tant predictor of prognosis in chronic
hepatitis C, as shown by its strong associ￾ation with TGFP1 mRNA expression.

Keywords: chronic hepatitis C, liver fibrogenesis, in situ
hybridisation, TGFO1 mRNA.
The course of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection, even after antiviral treatment, is diffi￾cult to predict. Although the disease is
frequently asymptomatic, the development of
liver fibrosis is common, and cirrhosis, occur￾ring in about one in five cases, is the major
complication of this chronic disease.' There are
no reliable biological or clinical indicators that
can predict which patients will develop fibrosis,
but if found, these would also help select
appropriate patients for antiviral treatment.
Liver biopsy is used to assess the extent of
liver damage, as a means of monitoring disease
progression, and as a source of information for
correct management. Histological examination
of the liver biopsy specimens allows activity and
fibrosis to be assessed.2 3 Activity gives an over￾all picture of the degree of necro-inflammatory
lesions (grade), while fibrosis reflects the
disruption to the liver architecture (stage).2 It
has been suggested that in hepatitis B virus
infection fibrosis is the result of activity, and
thus histological activity might predict the sub￾sequent development of fibrosis or cirrhosis.4
This hypothesis has been extended to chronic
hepatitis C so that the presence of histological
activity is a major criterion for starting antiviral
treatment. However, this has been challenged,
as data from several series of liver biopsy speci￾mens from patients with chronic hepatitis C
showed that activity is usually mild, but that
fibrosis and cirrhosis are common findings.'68
As far as we are aware no studies have assessed
the predictive value of these different histologi￾cal features in terms of the aggravation of liver
fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.
Liver tissue can also be used to investigate
tissue markers of ongoing fibrogenesis, a com￾plex process that examines the different extra￾cellular matrix (ECM) components, such as
collagens, fibronectin, and proteoglycans.' 10 In
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, collagens, especially
type I collagen, are much in evidence."
Furthermore, type I collagen mRNA seems to
be a definitive and reliable marker for fibro￾genic activity and so of potential fibrous
deposition.'2 13
The aim of this study was to determine the
pathological features associated with the po￾tential progression to fibrosis in chronic hepa￾titis C. We therefore evaluated the degree of
fibrogenesis in liver biopsy specimens by quan￾tification of liver type I collagen mRNA, using
a sensitive quantitative reverse transcription￾polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We
also performed semiquantitative scoring of the
different pathological features present in the
same liver biopsy specimens and assessed the
correlations between histological scores and
type I collagen mRNA concentration.
As transforming growth factor (TGF) f31 has
a major role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in
chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis-mainly by
stimulation of fat storing cells, the main cellu￾lar source of matrix proteins'415 we also
quantified its mRNA concentration in the same
biopsy specimens and correlated it with
histological variables. TGFP1 mRNA expres￾998 Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. . Technical Services Serials

and the results compared with quantitative
data.
Methods
Twenty eight patients (nine women and 19
men; mean age 48 years, range 29-69 years)
were included in the study. All patients were
positive for antibody to HCV by second
generation tests. Serum viral load was quanti￾fied by branched DNA (Amplec Chiron, Chri￾ron, Emeryville, California, USA). Genotypes
were also determined by a competitive oligo￾nucelotide priming (COP) PCR assay in 21
patients.16 Serum aminotransferases (ALT),
bilirubin, and y-glutamyltranspeptidase were
measured on entry to the study. None of the
patients had received antiviral treatment. The
delay between presumed infection and time of
inclusion was determined for 19 patients.
Selection of patients was based on consecutive
recruitment and on the availability of enough
liver tissue to perform both an accurate
histological study and RNA extraction for
mRNA quantification.
Twelve patients received interferon a 2b
(Intron-A, Schering Plough, UK) in a dose of 3
mU, three times weekly for six months. Two
patients were non-responders (no improve￾ment in ALT activity during treatment), four
were partial responders (decrease of less than
50% of initial value of ALT), and six were
complete responders (return to normal of ALT
values).
Five patients without HCV infection, normal
liver function tests, and neither chronic hepati￾tis nor fibrosis on the biopsy specimen, consti￾tuted the control group.
Liver biopsy specimens were obtained for
each patient using a percutaneous procedure.
About half of each specimen was immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until RNA extraction was performed; the rest
of the specimen was fixed, embedded in paraf￾fin wax and processed for histological study
according to standard procedures.
A set of representative paraffin wax embed￾ded liver biopsy specimens showing chronic
HCV infection with differing degrees of activity
were selected for in situ hybridisation. These
were cut into 5 jm thick sections.
HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF LIVER BIOPSY
SPECIMENS
Liver biopsy specimens were examined simul￾taneously by two different pathologists, neither
of whom was aware of clinical and biological
data except for positivity for antibody to HCV.
For each liver biopsy specimen, the semi￾quantitative assessment of elementary features
potentially present in HCV hepatitis was
performed using a standardised question￾naire.'7 The following lesions were recorded: por￾tal fibrosis (FO = no fibrosis, Fl = portal fibrosis
without septa, F2 = portal fibrosis with rare
septa, F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis, F4
= cirrhosis); focal lobular necrosis (0 = less than
one necro-inflammatory focus per lobule, 1 = at
least one necro-inflammatory focus per lobule, 2
= several necro-inflammatory foci per lobule or
confluent or bridging necrosis); portal inflamma￾tion (0 = absent, 1 = presence of mononuclear
aggregates in some portal tracts, 2 = mononu￾clear aggregates in all portal tracts, 3 = large and
dense mononuclear aggregates in all portal
tracts); and piecemeal necrosis (0 = absent, 1 =
focal alteration of periportal plate in some portal
tracts, 2 = diffuse alteration of periportal plate in
some portal tracts or focal lesions around all por￾tal tracts, 3 = diffuse alteration of periportal plate
in all portal tracts). Fatty changes (micro and/or
macrovesicular) were graded as 0 = absent, 1 =
mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Bile duct damage
was also reported.
The activity of chronic hepatitis was re￾corded as follows: AO = no histological activity,
Al = minimal activity, A2 = moderate activity,
A3 = severe activity. The degree of disease
activity was defined by the integrated assess￾ment of all necro-inflammatory lesions accord￾ing to an algorithm, including piecemeal
necrosis as a major decision criterion and
lobular necrosis as a secondary criterion. The
reproducibility of this activity grading was
reported as acceptable according to a previous
study.'7 Finally, the histological activity index
of Knodell et al'8 (periportal ± bridging necro￾sis, lobular necrosis, inflammation and portal
fibrosis scores) was separately recorded.
Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tis￾sue using a method derived from the procedure
of Chomczynski and Sacchi.'9 The concentra￾tion and purity of total RNA were evaluated by
spectrophotometry at 260 and 280 nm. The
quality of RNA was also controlled by electro￾phoresis on a 1 % agarose gel by checking the
18S and 28S RNA bands.
Type I collagen and TGFp1 mRNA of each
liver biopsy specimen were quantified by a
quantitative RT-PCR assay.20 Expression of an
endogenously expressed RNA (transcription
factor TFIID) was used as the internal control
for each specimen. Each sample was normal￾ised on the basis of its internal control content
(TFIID).
Reverse transcription of total RNA was per￾formed in a final volume of 20 jtl containing lx
RT-PCR buffer (1 mM each dNTP, 5 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM KC1, 10 mM TRIS-HCI, pH
8.3), 1 unit of RNase inhibitor, 50 units of
Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse tran￾scriptase (RT) (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City,
California, USA), 2.5 mM random hexamers,
and 1 jig of total RNA. Samples were incubated
at 20°C for 10 minutes, 42°C for 30 minutes,
and reverse transcriptase was inactivated by
heating at 99°C for five minutes and cooled at
5°C for five minutes. Thereafter, the 20 jl vol￾ume was brought to 100 ,ul with lx RT-PCR
buffer.
Quantitative PCR is based on co￾amplification of specific cDNA with a quanti￾tative DNA standard (QDS) using the same
pair of primers.20 Specific QDS were generated
by creating a 12 base pair insertion in the wild
type cDNA sequence for each target gene.
QDS were constructed by PCR from cDNA
using a composite primer. With this procedure,
target cDNA and QDS yield labelled PCR
products of different sizes which were identi￾999Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. . Technical Services Serials

fled by a DNA sequencer. We ensured that the
amplification efficiency between target cDNA
and QDS was maintained during the exponen￾tial and non-exponential phases.
Selection of PCR primers was performed
using the OLIGO program from Bioscience
Inc. (Plymouth, Minnesota, USA). Fluorescein
labelling was carried out during primer synthe￾sis by adding Fluorprime (Pharmacia, Upp￾sala, Sweden). The sequence of each primer
and PCR product sizes are presented in table 1.
For each PCR run, a master mix was
prepared on ice using lx PCR buffer (2 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM KC1, 10 mM TRIS-HCI, pH
8.3), 10 pM each dNTP, 200 gM each primer,
1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer)
and a known amount of the corresponding
QDS. The QDS amount for each target cDNA
was chosen to obtain similar fluorescence
intensities for standard and corresponding
cDNA derived PCR products. Ten microlitres
of diluted RT were added to 40 gl of the PCR
master mix. Amplification was achieved by 30
cycles for type I collagen and TGF,B1 and 35
cycles for TFIID (94°C, 30 seconds; 55°C, 30
seconds; 72°C, one minute), followed by a final
incubation of five minutes at 72°C. In each
PCR run a control without template was run in
parallel. All PCR reactions were performed
using a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermocycler.
Fluorescence PCR products were co￾electrophoresed with internal size standards
(Genescan 2500 Rox, Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California, USA) through a 6%
denaturing gel run on a 373A DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) and analysed using
Genescan 672 Software (Applied Biosystems).
PCR products of target cDNA and corre￾sponding QDS are represented by two different
peaks of fluorescence. The area of each peak,
expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU),
was correlated with the amount of PCR prod￾uct. Results for each gene were expressed as a
ratio between target cDNA RFU and its corre￾sponding QDS RFU. Experiments were per￾formed twice with three sets for each data
point.
Results are presented as mean (SD) unless
otherwise stated. Variability of the different
assessments was estimated by standard devia￾tion and coefficient of variation. Statistical
analysis was performed using Student's t test
and the Mann-Whitney U test. When neces￾sary, statistics were performed after logarithmic
transformation of the data. Correlations be￾tween type I collagen, TGF 1 mRNA concen￾trations with the different histological scores,
clinical and biological data were performed
using Pearson's test.
IN SITU HYBRIDISATION
A cocktail of single stranded oligonucleotides,
chemically synthesised, and modified at the 5'
end with digoxigenin by the manufacturer (R
and D Systems Inc., Minnesota, USA) was
used. It consisted of an equimolar mixture of
three exon specific probes based on the
antisense sequence of exon 6 (28 mer), exon
7A (27 mer), and exon 7B (26 mer) of the
TGFl1 gene.
In situ hybridisation was performed on
paraffin wax embedded liver sections, as
described before.2' Briefly, sections were de￾waxed in xylene and graded ethanol, rinsed in
DEPC water for five minutes, and treated with
proteinase K at a final concentration of 10
,ug/ml for 10 minutes at 37°C in 50 mM TRIS,
pH 7.6. Slides were post-fixed in 0.4%
paraformaldehyde in lx PBS for 20 minutes at
4°C. Liver sections were then hybridised over￾night at 370C in 4x SSC, 50% formamide, lx
Denhart's solution, 5% dextran sulphate, 0.5
mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast
tRNA containing 500 ng/ml of digoxigenin
labelled TGFP1 antisense probe. After washing
in decreasing concentrations of SSC (sodium
citrate/sodium chloride) (twice for five minutes
in 4x SSC at 37°C, twice for five minutes in 2x
SSC at 37°C, and once in lx SSC for 15 min￾utes at room temperature), tissue sections were
incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody at a 1
in 500 dilution (Boehringer Mannheim, Man￾nheim, Germany) in 100 mM TRIS-HCI, 150
mM NaCl, pH 7.5, for 20 minutes at 37°C.
After two rinses in the same buffer for five
minutes and washing in DEPC-water with
levamisole 1 mM, alkaline phosphatase was
detected using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride.
Digoxigenin labelled sense oligonucleotide
as well as sections incubated without probe
were used as negative controls. Liver sections
incubated with a digoxigenin labelled poly-dT
oligoprobe and recombinant CHO cell lines
expressing TGF31 incubated with the TGFP1
antisense probe were used as positive controls.
These controls were systematically processed
in each experiment and under the same condi￾tions.
Results
The mean delay between presumed infection
and liver biopsy was 16.8 months (range seven
to 40 months) in the 19 patients for whom data
were available. The mean (SD) values of serum
ALT, bilirubin, and y-glutamyltranspeptidase
were, respectively: 2.9N (2.1), 9.4 (3.61)
,umol/l and 5N (0.8) (N = upper limit). Ten
patients were genotype lb, three were genotype
la, one was genotype 2a, five were genotype 3a,
and the other two could not be determined
using the current procedure.
For each liver biopsy specimen, the principal
histological features and the degree of activity
according to the METAVIR and Knodell index
are reported in table 2. According to META￾VIR, fibrosis was graded as Fl in 10 patients,

(A2), and one had severe activity (A3). The
mean value of the Knodell index was 8.3 (2.2)
(range 5-12).'
Type I collagen and TGFf1 mRNA were
quantified in the livers of 28 patients with
chronic hepatitis C and in five controls. The
concentrations of type I collagen and TGFI1
mRNA in each subject were normalised to that
of the TFIID mRNA value in the same biopsy
sample. The mean coefficients of variation of
triplicate assessments of TFIID, type I colla￾gen, and TGF3l mRNA in the 30 samples
were, respectively: 0.06 (range 0.02-0.10),
0.1 1 (0.04-0.15), and 0.06 (range 0.01-0.09).
In the control group the mean concentration
of type I collagen mRNA was 0.43 (0.08) and
that of TGF 1 mRNA was 0.15 (0.08). In
patients with chronic hepatitis C type I
collagen mRNA was 1.7 (1.9), which was
significantly higher than that in the control
group (p < 0.01). The mean TGFP1 mRNA in
patients with chronic hepatitis C was 0.5 (0.3),
significantly higher than that of the control
group (p < 0.01).
The concentration of TGFP1 mRNA corre￾lated significantly with type I collagen mRNA
concentration (r = 0.45; p = 0.02).
CORRELATIONS BETWEEN TYPE I COLLAGEN
MRNA AND BIOLOGICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL DATA
In chronic hepatitis C patients, the concentra￾tion of type I collagen mRNA correlated with
neither the biological data nor the delay in
contamination. No correlation was observed
between type I collagen mRNA and the HCV
genotype (1.8 (2.1) and 1.2 (1.1) in the lb
compared with the non-lb genotype groups).
Nor was there any correlation observed with
the extent of HCV viraemia.
Among the different primary pathological
features assessed, fibrosis was the only lesion to
be correlated with the type I collagen mRNA
concentration (r = 0.39; p = 0.03). The mean
concentration of type I collagen mRNA was
significantly lower in the 20 patients with Fl or
F2 (1.2 (1.3)) than in the eight patients with F3
or F4 (2.9 (2.6); p = 0.03) fibrosis. No correla￾tion was observed with other histological
features. Results are shown in details in table 3.
Among patients with significant fibrosis
(F>F2), mean type I collagen mRNA was not
significantly different between patients with no
or mild activity (AO or Al, n = 8, 1.4 (1.2)) and
those with moderate or severe activity (A2 or
A3, n = 10, 2.3 (2.5)).
To analyse in more detail the correlation
between type I collagen mRNA and histologi￾cal features, the patients were divided into two
groups according to the concentration of type I
collagen mRNA: those with higher than the
median value (>1.1, n = 15) and those with
lower than the median value (<1.1, n = 13).
Comparisons between these two groups
showed that the degree of fibrosis was signifi￾cantly higher in the group of patients with
higher type I collagen mRNA than in the other
group (2.3 (1.0) vs 1.5 (0.7); p = 0.01). No
significant difference was observed for other
histological features.

The patients were divided into two groups
according to the concentration of TGF,1
mRNA: those with above the median value
(>0.4, n = 16) and those with below (<0.4, n =
12). Comparisons between these two groups
showed that the degree of lobular necrosis and
histological activity according to METAVIR
was significantly higher in the group of patients
with TGF[1 mRNA than the other group
(lobular necrosis: 0.9 (0.4) vs 0.4 (0.4), p =

A significant trend was also observed for fibro￾sis (1.5 (0.9) vs 2.2 (1.0), p = 0.06). No signifi￾cant differences were observed for other histo￾logical features.
The mean concentration of type I collagen
mRNA in the non- or partial responders was
higher but not significantly different (1.95
(2.45)) from that in the complete responders
(0.66 (0.66)). TGF,1 mRNA was also higher,
but not significantly different (0.56 (0.3)), in
the non- or partial responders from that in
complete responders (0.39 (0.28)).

C TGFI31 mRNA was expressed in isolated
mononuclear cells of portal tracts and peripor￾tal inflammatory infiltrate as well as in some
cells of the hepatic capsule (fig 1). In chronic
hepatitis with severe activity, the major source
of TGFP1 mRNA was detected in the liver
lobule (fig 2A). An intense signal was observed
in focal areas of lobular necrosis composed of
aggregates of mononuclear inflammatory cells
in contact with a few necrotic liver cells. Close
to these areas, TGFP1 transcripts were also
detected in perisinusoidal cells (fig 3). No
expression was observed neither in hepatocytes
nor in biliary cells. No staining was detected in
negative controls (fig 2B).
Discussion
In chronic liver disease development of fibrosis
induces substantial changes in the liver struc￾ture. Because this evolution is frequently, but
not always, observed in HCV infection, it is
important to have histological indicators that
can predict liver fibrosis and thus help in the
selection of patients for treatment. An ideal
study would be to follow up untreated patients
with chronic hepatitis C by sequential liver
biopsy, and then to deduce which features
present on initial biopsy specimens are associ￾ated with further development of fibrosis. Such
a study is not feasible, largely for ethical
reasons. To predict the development of liver
fibrosis, we quantified liver type I collagen
mRNA, a sensitive marker of active fibrogen￾esis. Type I collagen is one of the major extra￾cellular matrix components in liver fibrosis,"'
and an increase in expression of its mRNA is a
necessary early step in the fibrogenic
process."2 -24
To quantify accurately the mRNA, we used a
quantitative RT-PCR procedure, as conven￾tional methods of mRNA analysis, such as
northern and dot blotting, are neither sensitive
nor accurate enough.'5 26 This method uses
endogenously expressed RNA as an internal

Features predictive of liverfibrosis in chronic hepatitis C infection
control to monitor the extent of degradation
and recovery of mRNA, and to control sample
to sample variations. For this reason, we quan￾tified TFIID in each biopsy sample, a consist￾ently expressed transcriptional factor. For each
sample, results of mRNA quantification (type I
collagen and TGF 1) were expressed on the
basis of its internal control (TFIID) content.
Type I collagen mRNA expression was
increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
A wide range of mRNA values was observed in
this group and it may be related to the sampling
ofpatients, based only on an anti-HCV positive
serology irrespective of an increase in transami￾nase activity or histological lesion.
To assess the histological lesions reflecting
ongoing fibrogenesis, we correlated type I col￾lagen mRNA with semiquantitative scores of
the different histological lesions. Interobserver
variation is a major drawback in the semiquan￾titative assessment of histological features in
hepatitis C."7 To minimise interobserver varia￾tions, two pathologists experienced in liver
pathology performed simultaneous readings of
all biopsy specimens, as we had already shown
that this procedure significantly decreased
interobserver variations.'7 Analysis of results
showed that the degree of fibrosis was the only
histological lesion that correlated with the type
I collagen mRNA concentration. This result
means that, in chronic hepatitis C, a pre￾existing fibrosis is a predictive histological
indicator of further aggravation of fibrosis.
None of the necro-inflammatory lesions,
whether taken independently or combined in a
scoring system, correlated with an increase in
type I collagen mRNA, either throughout the
whole group of patients or in the group of
patients with clinically important fibrosis. Our
data suggest that fibrosis is at least as important
as grade in the prediction of further fibrosis.
These results also underline the usefulness of
independent assessment of activity (grade) and
fibrosis (stage), as recently recommended.2 3 If
these results are confirmed in a larger group
the presence of fibrosis, whatever the degree of
histological activity, would have to be consid￾ered when selecting patients for treatment.
Our study shows that TGF 1 mRNA is
highly correlated with histological grade ac￾cording either to METAVIR'7 or the Knodell
index.'8 Furthermore, among the different pri￾mary necro-inflammatory features, only lobu￾lar necrosis correlates with the increase in
TGF 1 mRNA value. This finding emphasises
the importance of this histological feature in
the global assessment of necro-inflammatory
features (activity) and in the fibrogenetic proc￾ess in hepatitis C. Results of our in situ
hybridisation experiments confirm these data.
Like other similar studies" 2 2 we detected
TGF,1 mRNA in some portal and periportal
inflammatory cells in chronic hepatitis C. Fur￾thermore, when activity was pronounced, we
found that a major site of TGFP1 mRNA pro￾duction were areas of focal lobular necrosis and
that perisinusoidal cells adjacent to these areas
of lobular necrosis also strongly expressed
TGFP1 mRNA. Taken together, these results
fit well with the concept that, in chronic hepa￾titis C, aggravation of chronic histological
lesions occurs throughout episodes of lobular
necrosis.2
Discrepancies exist concerning a correlation
between TGF1 mRNA concentration and
piecemeal necrosis or portal inflammation.
While Castilla et al'2 found a significant corre￾lation between the TGF,B1 mRNA concentra￾tion and all necro-inflammatory lesions in￾cluded in the Knodell index, Roulot et alf9
found none. These differences could be
explained by patient sampling as some studies
included patients with both chronic hepatitis B
and C,22 or else by the different mRNA quanti￾fication procedures used. Another major factor
is the accuracy of the histological analysis, as
we have already shown high interobserver vari￾ations in the assessment of histological lesions
in chronic hepatitis C, especially necro￾inflammatory features such as piecemeal
necrosis and portal inflammation."
Several studies have emphasised the im￾portance of the HCV genotype and viral load in
the severity of disease and the treatment
response.30 We found no correlations between
either type I collagen or TGF31 mRNA with
the HCV genotype or viral load. Furthermore,
although higher type I collagen and TGF,1
mRNA concentrations were observed in the
non- or partial responders than in the complete
responders, differences did not reach signifi￾cance.
We have shown that the expression of type I
collagen mRNA in the liver correlates with
TGFp1 mRNA. This agrees with previous
studies using semiquantitative mRNA
procedures.22 23 Furthermore, in our study, we
found a trend for correlation between an
increase in the TGF 1 mRNA concentration
and semiquantitative scoring of fibrosis. These
results suggest that TGFP1 has a role in the
fibrogenesis in hepatitis C.
In conclusion, our study shows that the his￾tological features of necro-inflammation and
fibrosis differ in their correlation with a
sensitive marker of fibrogenesis in chronic
hepatitis C. This underlines the importance of
separate assessment of these two features in
chronic hepatitis C liver biopsy reports. The
correlation between lobular necrosis and
TGF,B1 mRNA suggests a major role for this
lesion in chronic hepatitis C.
