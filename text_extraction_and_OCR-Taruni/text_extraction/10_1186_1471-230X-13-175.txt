Abstract
Background: Assessment and characterization of human colon microbiota is now a major research area in human
diseases, including in patients with hepatitis B liver cirrhosis (HBLC).
Methods: We recruited 120 patients with HBLC and 120 healthy controls. The fecal microbial community and
functions in the two groups were analyzed using high-throughput Solexa sequencing of the complete metagenomic
DNA and bioinformatics methods.
Results: Community and metabolism-wide changes of the fecal microbiota in 20 HBLC patients and 20 healthy
controls were observed and compared. A negative correlation was observed between the Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores
and Bacteroidetes (P < 0.01), whereas a positive correlation was observed between the scores and Enterobacteriaceae
and Veillonella (P < 0.01). Analysis of the additional 200 fecal microbiota samples demonstrated that these intestinal
microbial markers might be useful for distinguishing liver cirrhosis microbiota samples from normal ones. The functional
diversity was significantly reduced in the fecal microbiota of cirrhotic patients compared with in the controls. At the
module or pathway levels, the fecal microbiota of the HBLC patients showed enrichment in the metabolism of
glutathione, gluconeogenesis, branched-chain amino acid, nitrogen, and lipid (P < 0.05), whereas there was a decrease
in the level of aromatic amino acid, bile acid and cell cycle related metabolism (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: Extensive differences in the microbiota community and metabolic potential were detected in the fecal
microbiota of cirrhotic patients. The intestinal microbial community may act as an independent organ to regulate the
body’s metabolic balance, which may affect the prognosis for HBLC patients.

Background
The human gut harbors up to 100 trillion microbes,
equivalent to 1011–1012 cells/g colonic content with a
biomass of >1 kg [1,2], which encode 100-fold more
unique genes than the human genome [3]. Microbial
communities in the human gut exhibit high levels of
variation; however, they are dominated by members of
just two bacterial phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [4].
Obligate anaerobes, such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium,
Bacillus, and Peptostreptococcus, account for 99.9% of the
intestinal microbiota, with Bacteroides and Bifidobacter￾ium accounting for 55% of them [5]. Most of the resident
microbes in the gut have a profound influence on human
physiology and nutrition [6,7].
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is widespread in China
and other Asian countries and chronic HBV infection may
develop into cirrhosis after several years. In a previous
study, patients with cirrhosis of different etiologies (HBV￾related and alcohol-related) had similar fecal microbial
communities, which led to the conclusion that the changes
observed between the different fecal microbiota were
mostly caused by cirrhosis [8]. Intestinal microbiota

constitutes a symbiotic ecosystem that keeps homeostatic
balance within the human body [6]. However, when
cirrhosis develops, portal hypertension promotes gastro￾intestinal stasis and edema, slowing down of peristalsis,
and increased permeability of the gut lining. Moreover,
impaired liver function leads directly to decreased de￾toxification ability and reduced secretion of bile acids
[9]. All these factors will disrupt the normal intestinal
microbiota equilibrium.
The intestinal microbiota significantly influences the
human metabolic phenotype, which involves in a broad
co-metabolism between human and microbiota. The anat￾omy and physiological functions of liver and intestinal
microbiota share a close relationship as a result of
enterohepatic circulation. The previous study suggested
that cirrhosis may be related to the intestinal microbiota
structure [8], but how the function and metabolism of
intestinal microbiota changed was not addressed. Our
understanding of the relationship between human distal
gut microbiota and cirrhosis was based mainly on the
results of culture-based studies until recent initiatives
utilizing a high-throughput sequencing approach [10,11],
which made it possible to characterize significant cirrhosis￾related alterations in the microbiota community and func￾tions in the present study. Our findings may generate novel
perspectives on the progress and prognosis of cirrhosis.
Methods
Human fecal sample collection
The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scoring system was used
to assess the severity of cirrhosis. A total of 240 individ￾uals, including 120 hepatitis B liver cirrhosis (HBLC)
patients (40 with CTP score A, 40 with CTP score B,
40 with CTP score C) and 120 healthy individuals, 40–
60 years old, with a body mass index (BMI) = 18.5–24.9
kg m–2 and without food preferences, were enrolled in
this study. Cirrhosis was diagnosed histologically in all
patients. None of the patients had comorbid diseases.
The control group consisted of 120 normal individuals
who visited the People’s Liberation Army 302 Hospital
in Beijing for routine health examinations. All healthy
individuals had normal liver biochemistry test results
with no evidence of hepatic or other diseases. None of
the subjects had received antibiotics, probiotics, steroids
or other hormones (including oral, intramuscular or intra￾venous injection) for at least 3 months before sampling.
Characteristics of the two groups are given in Table 1 and
Additional file 1: Table S1. Patients and normal individuals
were each asked to provide a fresh stool sample, which
was frozen immediately for DNA extraction. Samples from
20 patients with HBLC (6 with CTP score A, 7 with CTP
score B, 7 with CTP score C) and 20 normal individuals
were subjected to metagenomic analysis and the other 200
samples were subjected to real-time qPCR analysis. All
participants signed an informed consent form prior to
entering the study. The study conformed to the ethical
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Metagenomic DNA extraction, DNA library construction
and sequencing
A frozen aliquot (200 mg) of each fecal sample was sus￾pended in 250 μL guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1 M Tris (pH
7.5) and 40 μL of 10% thiocyanate. Metagenome extraction
was conducted as described previously [12,13]. DNA
library preparation was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Illumina). Workflows were
designed to perform cluster generation, template hybrid￾ization, isothermal amplification, linearization, blocking
and denaturation, and hybridization of the sequencing
primers. High-throughput Illumina/Solexa sequencing
of a 350-bp library for each sample was conducted using an
Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx with read lengths of 90 bp.
The base-calling pipeline (version Illumina Pipeline-0.3)
was used to process the raw fluorescence images and call
sequences. High-quality reads were extracted by filtering
out low quality reads with ‘N’ bases, adapter contamination,
or human DNA contamination from the Illumina raw data.
Gene catalogue construction
The short read assembler SOAPdenovo 2.20 [12], with
the same parameters used to construct the MetaHIT gene
catalogue in 2010 [13], was used to assemble the high￾quality short reads from the samples. Gene prediction was
performed using GeneMark v2.7 [14]. All the predicted
genes were aligned pairwise using BLASTN. To construct
a non-redundant gene catalogue, sequences that aligned
over at least 90% of their length with more than 95% iden￾tity (no gaps allowed) were removed as redundancies.
Bioinformatic analysis
Genes were aligned to the NCBI nr database (e-value < 1e￾10, identity > 90%) and taxonomic assignment of the
predicted genes was performed using an in-house pipeline
as described previously [15]. In this study, samples were
clustered using Hellinger distance and then principle
component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify
the significant features of the intestinal microbes that
distinguished patients from healthy individuals. The top five
principal components (P value in Tracy-Widom test < 0.05
and contribution > 3%) were tested. Using the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test method based on the pair-wise comparison
matrix, genes with significantly differential abundance
between the patients and normal subjects were assessed
and subjected to taxonomic assignment at the species level.
Genes were aligned to the eggNOG (v 3.0) and KEGG
(release 59.0) databases using BLASTP (e-value ≤1e-5)
for functional annotations [16,17]. Each sequence was
assigned to a KEGG orthologous group or to an eggNOG
Wei et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2013, 13:175 Page 2 of 8

orthologous group based on the highest scoring annotated
hit(s) that contained at least one high-scoring segment
pair (HSP) scoring over 60 bits. For genes with no hits in
the eggNOG database, novel gene families were identified
based on all-against-all BLASTP results and clustered using
the Markov Cluster (MCL) algorithm with an inflation
factor of 1.1 and a bit-score cutoff of 60 [15].
Real-time qPCR
Real-time qPCR was performed using a DNA Engine
Opticon 2 apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the
associated Opticon Monitor software (version 3.0, Bio￾Rad). All primer sets used are listed in Table 2 [18-20].
Each primer mixture (25μL) contained 12.5μL of SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Dalian, China) containing MgCl2,
Tris–HCl, KCl, deoxynucleoside triphosphate, SYBR Green
I, and Taq DNA polymerase, 0.5μM primer, and 2μL of the
template DNA. Amplifications were performed under the
following temperature profiles: one cycle at 95°C for 3 min,
30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing for
40 s, and extension for 45 s, followed by a final elongation
step at 72°C for 7 min. Fluorescence was measured after
the extension phase of each cycle at an appropriate
temperature for 10 s to avoid interference of primer￾dimers, secondary structure, or spurious priming. The DNA
template concentration was determined by comparison with
serially diluting standards (101 to 108 copies of plasmid
DNA containing the respective amplicon for each set of
primers) running on the same plate. Each reaction was
repeated in triplicate on separate run plates.
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to
identify the association between microbiota abundance
and cirrhosis. Correlation between variables was com￾puted using Spearman rank correlation. The Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, Spearman rank correlation and Student
t test were conducted using SPSS version 11.0 for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We applied
the “q-value” method proposed previously to estimate
the FDR (false discovery rate) instead of a sequential
P-value rejection method [21]. The statistical hypoth￾esis tests were performed on a large number of features
of the gene, KEGG orthologue, and eggNOG ortholo￾gue profiles.
Results
High-throughput Illumina/Solexa sequencing data
The proportion of high-quality reads in all 40 of the
fecal DNA samples was about 91%, and the actual insert
sizes ranged from 327–384bp. We obtained an average
of 18,852,250 paired-end reads and 8,657,932 single-end
reads for each sample, making up a total 1.3 billion
high-quality reads that were free of human DNA and
adaptor contaminants. We constructed non-redundant gene
catalogues that contained 1,603,579 genes from the patient
samples (an average of 80,179 genes per sample) and

2,118,215 genes from the normal samples (an average
of 105,911 genes per sample).
Comparison of the microbial structure in the healthy and
HBLC samples
Analysis on the composition of fecal microbiota (Figure 1)
clearly demonstrated that the samples from the cirrhotic
patients contained reduced numbers of Bacteroidetes and
increased numbers of Proteobacteria compared with
the normal samples. Specifically, our data showed that
Bacteroidetes made up 53% of the normal fecal microbiota
but only 4% of the HBLC fecal microbiota, whereas
Proteobacteria, which contains most of the opportunistic
pathogens, made up only 4% of the normal fecal micro￾biota but increased to 43% of the HBLC fecal microbiota.
These trends observed at the phylum level were also seen
at the family level. For example, the Enterobacteriaceae,
Veillonellaceae, and Streptococcaceae families made up
less than 1% in normal fecal microbiota but were relatively
dominant, with proportions ranging from 18–39% in
HBLC fecal microbiota, which is consistent with the
results of Chen and Zhao [8,22] for intestinal micro￾biota from cirrhosis patients.
To further investigate the differences in fecal micro￾biota between the HBLC and normal samples, PCA was
employed. We found that the first and second principal
components clearly separated the normal and HBLC fecal
microbiota structures (Figure 2A). Some of the species
with significantly different abundance between the two
groups were Escherichia coli,Veillonella dispar,Veillonella
parvula, which were significantly enriched, and Bacter￾oides species, which were reduced, in the HBLC samples
compared with the normal samples.
To find which species were significantly absent or
enriched in patients, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test method to analyze the genes that were in signifi￾cantly differential abundance between the HBLC and
normal fecal microbiota. We found that 49,442 genes
and 72,584 genes were significantly enriched (P < 0.01)
in patients and normal samples, respectively. Of these,
a total of 103,099 genes could be matched to known
species with a large ratio of coverage (Figure 2B). We
found that the fecal microbiota from the cirrhotic
patients contained a remarkable absence of Bacteroides
cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides intestinalis, Bacteroides unifor￾mis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides_fragilis, Bacteroides
Figure 1 Composition of fecal microbiota from HBLC patients and healthy individuals. Data are represented as the average percentage of
each individual profile. Fecal microbiota community analysis at the phylum, class, order, family levels demonstrated that the fecal microbiota from
the HBLC patients contained a significant absence of Bacteroidetes (4% compared with 53% in the microbiota from the controls) and enrichment
of Proteobacteria (43% compared with 4% in the microbiota from the controls), which included most of the pathogens. The microbiota in the HBLC
patients showed a significant enrichment of Gammaproteobac (42%), Negativicutes (21%), and Bacilli (20%) at the class level, Enterobacteriales (41%),
Selenomonadales(20%), and Lactobacillales (19%) at the order level, and Enterobacteriaceae (39%), Veillonellaceae (19%), and Streptococcaceae (18%) at
the family level.

thetaitaomicron, Bacteroides sp.D1, Bacteroides eggerthii,
Bacteroides stercoris, and Bacteroides vulgates, all of
which belong to the Bacteroides genus (P < 0.01) and
were negatively correlated with the CTP scores (R < −0.7).
In contrast, the fecal microbiota from the cirrhotic
patients contained high abundances of Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloaca, Veillonella_-
parvula, Shigella dysenteriae, Veillonella dispar, Shigella
flexneri, Salmonella enteric, Enterobacter cancerogenus,
and Escherichia albertii, all of which belong to the Veillo￾nella genus or Enterobacteriaceae family (P < 0.01) and
were positively correlated with the CTP scores (R > 0.7).
A comparison of the dominant and subdominant bacteria
genera between the HBLC and normal fecal microbiota
was carried out by real-time qPCR (Figure 2C). Compared
with the normal samples, Enterobacteriaceae and Veillo￾nella were significantly increased, and Bacteroides and
Clostridium were significantly decreased in the HBLC
samples, confirming the results obtained from the high￾throughput Illumina/Solexa sequencing.
Functional characterization of HBLC fecal microbiota
A functional analysis of our data revealed functions that
were enriched or decreased in the HBLC fecal microbiota
compared with the normal fecal microbiota (Figure 3A, B).
At the highest hierarchical levels, fecal microbiota from
HBLC patients revealed an enrichment in amino acid
transport and metabolism (P < 0.01), secondary metabolites
biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (P = 0.005), inor￾ganic ion transport and metabolism (P = 0.001), extra￾cellular structures (P = 0.001), energy production and
conversion (P = 0.014), and intracellular trafficking and
secretion (P = 0.019), and a decrease in cell wall/membrane
biogenesis (P = 0.047), signal transduction metabolism
(P = 0.02), replication, recombination and repair (P = 0.018),
and general function prediction only (P = 0.012). Interest￾ingly, for most of these strikingly different functions, the
relative abundance of genes in each category was statisti￾cally lower in the HBLC microbiota samples compared
with their abundances in the normal microbiota samples,
indicating a reduction in functional diversity in the HBLC
microbiota.
Bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) are members of the choloyl￾glycine hydrolase family (EC 3.5.1.24) and are important in
bile acid metabolism. BSHs have been isolated and/or char￾acterized from several species of intestinal bacteria [23].
We found that genes annotated as BSH related to primary
and secondary bile acid biosynthesis [KEGG:K01442] were
in much higher abundance in the normal microbiota than
in the HBLC microbiota (P = 0.013) (Figure 3C).

Human gut bacteria are expected to encounter a broad
spectrum of carbohydrate substrates. The fecal microbiota
from the cirrhotic patients showed enhanced metabolic
ability for carbohydrate transportation because of the
high abundance of genes involved in phosphotransferase
systems (P = 0.006) and ABC transporters (P = 0.004).
Furthermore, the HBLC microbiota showed an enhanced
ability to transform non-carbohydrate carbon substrates
into glucose because of the high abundance of genes
involved in the metabolism of gluconeogenesis (GNG)
and pyruvate (pyruvate is one of the main gluconeogenic
precursors) (P < 0.05).
In the lipid metabolism KEGG pathway, the fecal
microbiota from the HBLC patients was significantly
enriched in genes associated with fatty acid metabolism
(R = 0.84, P = 0.025), unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis
(R = 0.59, P = 0.018), glycerophospholipid (R = 0.82, P =
0.004), alpha-linolenic acid (R = 0.77, P = 0.007), and
butanoate (R = 0.78, P = 0.011), which may provide add￾itional energy resources in these patients.
In the amino acid metabolism pathway, the fecal
microbiota from HBLC patients was significantly enriched
in genes associated with the metabolic ability of branched￾chain amino acid (BCAA) involved in the valine, leucine
and isoleucine biosynthesis (P = 0.030) and degration (P =
0.002). Conversely, genes associated with the metabolism
of aromatic amino acids, including tyrosine (P = 0.0007),
phenylalanine (P = 0.011), were less abundant in the
microbiota from HBLC patients than in the microbiota
from the healthy controls.

In addition, the fecal microbiota of HBLC patients were
enriched for glutathione metabolism (P = 0.008), glutathione
synthase (EC 6.3.2.3) and glutathione reductase (NADPH)
(EC 1.8.1.7) (P < 0.01).
In brief, our data showed that the fecal microbiota
structure, as well as a variety of functions were different
in HBLC patients compared with in the normal controls,
suggesting that the microbiota had changed to adjust to
the cirrhosis-related intestinal microenvironment.
Discussion
The human gut harbors a vast ensemble of microbes
and has the highest recorded density of any microbial
habitat in nature [2]. Genes of intestinal flora are consid￾ered as a second genome, which can affect the health status
of humans [13]. The reduced intestinal blood perfusion,
mesenteric ischemia, and decreased bowel movement
caused by cirrhosis appears to have changed the normal
microenvironment that is suitable for beneficial populations
Bacteroides and Clostridium, thereby allowing opportun￾istic pathogens like Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonella to
invade and colonize. Veillonella can hydrolyze conjugated
bile salts and promote the impairment of micelle for￾mation or cirrhosis. The abnormal intestinal microbiota
structure that we detected in HBLC patients may negatively
affect their prognosis.
Our data revealed striking functional differences between
the patients’ fecal microbiota and the normal fecal micro￾biota. The fecal microbiota from the cirrhotic patents
contained genes that are important for toxins depredation
and nutrient absorption. For nearly every major function,
the relative abundance of the associated genes was statisti￾cally lower in the patients compared with the controls.
Furthermore, the microbiota from the cirrhotic patients
contained a marked enhancement of genes related to
material transport and metabolism and an absence of
genes for metabolism related to cell cycle. Therefore, we
inferred that the microbiota from HBLC patients harbored
more fastidious bacteria that required more nutrients in
the external environment for survival and growth.
Glutathiones, with broad-spectrum detoxification activity,
are involved in biotransformations that change the harmful
toxins in the body into harmless substances that can be
excreted. Most of the intestinal anaerobic bacteria do
not have a glutathione metabolic pathway, so we inferred
that the microbiota genes that were enriched for gluta￾thione metabolism in the HBLC patients might have
arisen as a result of the decrease in the abundance of
Bacteroidetes. Large doses of administered drugs, impaired
liver function, and increased toxins from opportunistic
pathogens or drug accumulation in a patients’ intestine,
may stimulate a compensatory mechanism in the micro￾biota to adjust their metabolic structure to degrade the
harmful toxins.
Strong correlations of interdependence, mutual compe￾tition, and mutual inhibition are known to occur between
bile acids and the intestinal microbiota community.
Conjugated bile acids released into the intestine are hydro￾lyzed by BSHs, which are secreted mainly by Bacteroides
and Clostridium, to form deconjugated bile acids [24,25].
These bacteria may be crucial for the 7α-dehydroxylation
of free-form primary bile acids, so that the secondary bile
acids can be combined with insoluble fiber flocculates
or absorbed through the membranes of cells lining the
colon, thereby reducing the bile acid concentration in the
intestine. The dissociation role catalyzed by BSH provides
carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources and energy for
Bacteroides and Clostridium [24,25]. Our data showed
that the BSH level was significantly reduced in fecal
microbiota from the HBLC patients, which was con￾comitant with the reduced abundance of Bacteroides
and Clostridium.
The fecal microbiota of the patients showed the ability
to compensate for the impaired liver functions in terms
of energy and nutrient metabolism. In healthy individuals,
GNG takes place mainly in the liver to keep blood glucose
levels from dropping too low. The decreased content of
hepatic glycogen caused by impaired liver function could
stimulate GNG metabolism in HBLC patients. Our data
suggested that the fecal microbiota of HBLC patients also
showed enhanced GNG, resulting in the generation of
glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as
pyruvate, to maintain the body’s energy supply. Cirrhotic
patients, who use lipids instead of carbohydrate as the
main energy source, had decreased level of total fatty acid
and unsaturated fatty acids in their plasma. The fecal
microbiota in the HBLC patients seemed to play a
compensatory role by enhancing unsaturated fatty acids
synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid
metabolism, which may provide energy resources for the
patients. HBLC patients have weak fitness and as a result
the peripheral tissues need to increase their consumption
of BCAA. Interestingly, the fecal microbiota in HBLC
patients also significantly enhanced the biosynthesis of
valine, leucine and isoleucine, which are all BCAA, to
partially supplement the need for BCAAs.
Conclusions
Intestinal microbiota acts as a fundamental system in
humans, regulating the body’s metabolic balance by
gene adjustment and microbe restructuring, which are
important in disease prognosis. Further comparative in￾vestigations into the interactions between human and
microbial communities, including whether a core set of
genes or functional biomarkers are associated with the
microbiota of HBLC patients versus the microbiota of
healthy individuals. Genetic or behavioral traits of the

need to be investigated further.
