Abstract
Background: A polymorphism (rs35705950) in the promoter region of the mucin MUC5B is associated with both
familial and sporadic forms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. (IPF) We hypothesize that this common MUC5B variant
will impact the expression of cough, a frequent disabling symptom seen in subjects with IPF.
Methods: We genotyped 136 subjects with IPF. All living subjects were provided with a Leicester Cough
Questionnaire (LCQ) to measure cough severity. We assessed allele effects of the MUC5B polymorphism on the LCQ
scores using SAS General Linear Models (GLM) in the patients with IPF.
Results: In the 68 of the total 136 IPF patients who returned the LCQ, MUC5B minor allele frequency (T) is
consistent with prior published studies (31%). We found a significant independent effect of the T allele on the LCQ
score (p = 0.002 for subjects with IPF). This effect is independent of other common causes of cough, including
gastroesophogeal reflux disease and upper airway cough syndrome.
Conclusions: Cough severity, a common disabling phenotypic component of IPF, is significantly associated with
the presence of the minor allele of a MUC5B promoter polymorphism. This study highlights a possible genetic
mechanism for phenotypic heterogeneity in pulmonary fibrosis.
Main text
Introduction
The Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous
group of lung diseases that result in progressive pulmon￾ary functional decline and death. Idiopathic pulmonary fi￾brosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic ILD, with an
estimated 100,000 Americans affected. Current theory
suggests that fibrotic lung disease occurs when genetically
susceptible individuals are exposed to environmental trig￾gers. Recently, a common variant in the promoter region
of the mucin 5B (MUC5B) gene [1] was found to be asso￾ciated with the development of idiopathic pulmonary fi￾brosis as well an increased production of MUC5B, an
airway mucin.
Cough is a prominent but not universal symptom in
patients with IPF. Cough is estimated to be present
in 84% of patients with IPF and is more prevalent in
patients who have never smoked or have more ad￾vanced disease [2]. IPF related cough can be extremely
debilitating with detrimental impact on quality of life
[3]. Moreover, in IPF, cough is an independent predictor
of disease progression [2]. While the etiology of cough
in a patient with IPF can be attributed to many causes
and a thorough investigation is warranted [4], often the
IPF itself is ultimately determined to be the primary
cause for cough.
The etiology of cough attributed to IPF is not clear.
There may be mechanical factors at play including de￾struction of the cough inhibitory fibers as the lung is
distorted with the fibrotic process [5]. Studies have dem￾onstrated that patients with IPF and ILD associated with
systemic sclerosis have increased cough sensitivity [6].
We hypothesize that the minor allele of the MUCB
promoter polymorphism (rs35705950), associated with
increased mucin production, correlates with a clinical
phenotype of IPF characterized by a more severe cough. * Correspondence: scholand@genetics.utah.edu 1

Methods and materials
Study subjects
Subjects were recruited from ongoing University of Utah
ILD studies between 2005 and 2012. The diagnosis of
IPF was established utilizing current diagnostic criteria
[7,8]. This study was approved by the University of Utah
Institutional Review Board (#00031215). All subjects
provided a written informed consent for participation.
Measurements
Subjects were given the Leicester Cough Questionnaire
(LCQ) [9]. This questionnaire provides a total cough in￾tensity score and three subscales measuring physical,
psychological, and social impacts of cough [9]. As speci￾fied in Birring [9], items for each scale were summed
and divided by the total number of items endorsed by
the scale. The total score is the sum of the scale scores
and ranges from 0–21.
Comorbid conditions known to cause cough were
determined by chart review and by personal interview
when possible. These conditions include smoking status
and history, use of ACE inhibitors, evidence of upper
airway cough syndrome (UACS; none, possible, or defin￾ite), history of sleep apnea, and gastroesophogeal reflux
disease (GERD). In addition, spirometry measuring forced
vital capacity (FVC) and Forced Expired Volume in one
second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) was per￾formed utilizing standard methodology [10].
Genotyping
Genotyping was performed using a commercially avail￾able TaqMan assay; rs35705950 (MUC5b) according to
the manufactures methods (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Each 5 ul PCR reaction contained 20 ng of
genomic DNA, primers, probes, TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix (containing AmpErase UNG, AmpliTaq Gold
enzyme, dNTPs, and reaction buffer). PCR was carried
out under the following conditions: 50°C for 2 minutes to
activate UNG, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
92°C for 15 sec, and 60°C for 1 minute using a 384 well
dual block ABI 9700. Fluorescent endpoints of the
TaqMan reactions were measured using a 7900HT se￾quence detection instrument.
Analyses
Chi-square test, T-test, and Fisher’s exact test were used
to compare diagnostic subgroups within our sample for
demographic characteristics and the rs35705950 minor
allele frequencies. We used SAS General Linear Models
(GLM) to test for association between the LCQ scale
scores and MUC5B genotype within the IPF group, first
employing a full model including all the secondary co￾variates listed above, in addition to age, gender, and IPF
status. Any subject with a missing value on any predictor
was not included in the analysis. From these analyses,
we report allele effects on questionnaire scales inde￾pendent of these other model effects, and also total vari￾ance (R2
) explained by the model. We then employed a
parsimonious model including only predictors that were
significant in the full model. We compared total variance
by the full model to variance explained by the parsimo￾nious model to explore the relative contribution of the
additional predictors and the potential loss of statistical
power due to missing data across all the predictors in
the full model.
Results
Descriptive results
A total of 136 subjects with IPF were genotyped for the
MUC5B SNP rs35705950. At the time of our study, 45
subjects had already died. 68 living subjects returned the
LCQ.
Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the
subset of 68 IPF cases for whom LCQ scores were avail￾able. The population was male dominant (61.76% (42/
68)) and mean age was 74.41 (standard deviation = 8.01).
The demographics of subjects who did not return the
questionnaire were 67.6% male (46/68) with a mean age
of 76.16. The two groups (with and without question￾naire) are age and sex matched with a chi-square of 0.39
and a t-score of 1.49 respectively. All subjects had a
diagnosis of IPF by ATS/ERS criteria.
Amongst the 68 patients with LCQ data, 71.64% of the
subjects endorsed a history of GERD. All subjects with
GERD reported treatment with proton pump inhibitors.
A smaller percentage of patients reported a history of
known UACS and were treated with a variety of therap￾ies including nasal steroids and antihistamines, mostly

on an intermittent basis. Only 35.82% of the patients re￾ported a history of smoking. None were current smokers.
The mean FVC and FEV1/FVC demonstrated restrict￾ive disease as expected. The DLCO was reduced. This is
summarized in Table 2. FVC and FEV1/FVC were en￾tered as predictors in two separate full models because
the use of FVC in defining FEV1/FVC results in multi￾collinearity if both are entered together as predictors in
the same model [11]. In each of these full models, the
FVC, the FEV1/FVC nor the DLCO were significant pre￾dictors of the cough measures, and the significance of
other predictors in the model were not substantively dif￾ferent in comparing one full model to the other. Of the
68 subjects for whom we did not have LCQ responses,
the mean FVC was 63.89% predicted (sd = 21.59). This
score is statistically significantly lower (t-2.34, p = 0.02)
than the group who answered the questionnaire, likely
reflecting accrual of these patients at the end stage of
their diseases.
The mean total LCQ score was 16.16 with a range of
7.16 – 21.0. A lower score reflects a more severe cough.
In IPF subjects with available LCQ data, the T allele is
observed with a frequency of 0.37. In the IPF subjects
for whom we do not have LCQ data, the T allele fre￾quency was 0.33.
Associations with LCQ
Table 3 presents results of the full model, controlling for
age, gender, GERD status, UACS status, percent pre￾dicted FVC, DLCO, smoking status, sleep apnea, ACE-I
use for patients with IPF. Cough intensity as measured
by the LCQ was significantly related to the T allele sta￾tus, age, ACE inhibitor use; all other covariates were not
significant. We see a significant association between the
genotype and the presence of cough.
Discussion
In our cohort of 68 IPF patients, we replicate the re￾ported association between the minor T allele of SNP
rs35705950 in the MUC5B promoter region and ILD.
Our data demonstrate a minor allele frequency (MAF)
of 37% in the group with LCQ and 33% in the group
without the LCQ, similar to previously published IPF
data [1,12]. Seibold et al. [1], reported a MAF of 37.5%
in cases and 9.1% in controls. Data from the 1000 Ge￾nomes Project gives a frequency of the T allele of 5.1%
for controls. Our study is therefore consistent with the
current observations that the minor allele is associated
with IPF.
Within the subset of patients for whom we have data
on cough severity, we found statistically significant asso￾ciation of the minor T allele with cough severity. This
association is independent of effects of age, gender and
other clinical variables (GERD, UACS, smoking status,
sleep apnea, FVC, FEV1/FVC and DLCO). This lack of
association with the FEV1/FVC ratio and DLCO sug￾gests that concomitant emphysema or other obstructive
disease does not account for any of the observed cough
differences. There were an additional 68 patients who
did not return the cough questionnaire. This is in part
because 45 of these patients had died prior to the initi￾ation of this study. It is notable that this group matches
the questionnaire group in age, sex and genotype fre￾quency. However, the pulmonary function was signifi￾cantly lower, likely related to the late phase of their
disease at the time of recruitment. The IPF subjects
demographics are consistent with the current literature
in that they were predominantly male and older in age.
Of note, our population does have a smaller percentage
of smokers than is typically reported. This reflects the
population of Utah where smoking is less common.
There are several possible mechanisms for our obser￾vation that MUC5B genetic variation is related to cough
severity. MUC5B expression is upregulated in patients
with IPF who carry the minor allele [1]. The upregula￾tion may impact airway clearance of mucus or increase
mucus secretion resulting in a symptomatic cough. Mur￾ine models suggest that quantities of intracellular mucin
in airway epithelial cells results from the balance be￾tween mucin production, clearance and secretion. This
balance is tightly controlled by MUC5AC and MUC5B
[13]. In normal airways, MUC5B appears to be the pri￾mary gel forming mucin in the small airways. Expression
of both of these mucins can be altered by several inflam￾matory factors [14] although it appears that MUC5B ex￾pression is less influenced in inflammatory states than is
MUC5AC [15].
The MUC5B polymorphism relationship to cough in
IPF observed in our study may be consistent with recent
findings by Seibold et al. [16] demonstrating that MUC5B

is the dominant mucin in the normal distal airway epithe￾lium and in the honeycomb lesion seen in IPF [16]. Mucin
may be developing distally in those patients with overex￾pression driven by the MUC5B mutations. Distal mucin
accumulation may trigger a cough that may or may not be
productive. This phenomenon is postulated in other dis￾eases such as asthma, bronchiolitis and emphysema where
the presence of excess mucus from the surface epithelium
primarily impacts the distal airways [17]. The previous
study by Siebold suggested that mucus production is en￾hanced in all patients with IPF regardless of the MUC5B
genotype [1,18]. However, MUC5B is the overexpressed
mucin in these patients and may possess specific qualities
that trigger an exaggerated cough. Interestingly, in our
study, the MUC5B polymorphism did not appear to im￾pact sinus disease suggesting there is no role of this gen￾etic variant in upper airway tract disease.
The presence of the minor (T) allele has been associated
with improved survival in IPF [18]. This finding supports
the genetic basis of disease heterogeneity associated with
the MUC5B genotype. The presence of cough would be
expected to increase shear stress postulated to be a factor
in IPF [19] and thus, from a biomechanical perspective, it
is difficult to reconcile increased cough and improved sur￾vival. While it is not immediately apparent how an en￾hanced cough and improved survival are interrelated, it
could be postulated that the cough encourages clearance
of infectious agents or decreases time of exposure to ex￾cess MUC5B and other deleterious molecules in the
respiratory bronchioles that potentially interfere with al￾veolar repair.
This study has a number of limitations. The number
of patients who responded to the questionnaire is rela￾tively small, mostly reflective of the death of subjects
who were accrued in earlier years prior to the current
study with the cough questionnaire. For these subjects,
descriptive information including sinus disease, acid re￾flux disease or estimates of cough severity on subjects
are not uniformly available. Thus, although the genotype
frequencies were similar in subjects with and without
cough questionnaires, we do not know if this group’s
cough severity has any relation to the T allele. A second
limitation is that our measure of cough was a self-report
rather than an objective cough count. This methodology
may introduce some reporter bias. However, it should be
noted that a well-accepted validated questionnaire was
utilized. Our analysis of the comorbidities known to
impact cough is suboptimal. Subjects were assigned a
categorization of affectation by self-report and medical
record review when available. In the case of GERD,
current estimates that up to 90% of patients with idio￾pathic pulmonary fibrosis have GERD [20]. Our reported
percentage of GERD likely underestimates true prevalence
of the GERD in our subjects. Moreover, we do not have
validated data quantifying the severity of reflux or the ef￾fectiveness of treatment. Future studies to follow up on
our observation would benefit from a larger study popula￾tion, more precise measures of the comorbidities known
to produce cough and an objective cough measure. In
addition, evaluating the relationship between the MUC5B
polymorphism and the Cough Quality of Life question￾naire, which has recently been validated for use in IPF
[21], should be considered. Evaluation of the association
between mucus characteristics, MUC5B allele and cough
severity might also be interesting.
The variable expression of cough in IPF patients is not
predictable. Cough is a problematic symptom in many,
but not all, patients with this disease. While well-known

cough risk factors such as GERD or ACE inhibitors can
sometimes be controlled, clinicians are often unsuccess￾ful in mitigating this troubling symptom. Recently, use
of thalidomide has been shown to decrease cough sever￾ity in IPF [22], but there are very few effective thera￾peutic options for treating cough. Understanding genetic
underpinnings of this and other specific clinical features
of IPF may allow for personalized therapeutic ap￾proaches with potential to improve cough or even slow
disease progression.
Our findings represent a potentially important applica￾tion of the role MUC5B plays in the phenotypic expres￾sion of IPF. Phenotypic heterogeneity is observed clinically
in patients with IPF but the genetic components of this
heterogeneity are not understood. As further genetic con￾tributions to IPF are elucidated, it is important to deter￾mine the associations between genotypes and phenotypic
expression. Our observation of the possible relationship
between MUC5B and cough suggests a possible influence
of this polymorphism and suggests that the presence of
the minor allele in MUC5B may account for a specific
phenotypic component of IPF.
