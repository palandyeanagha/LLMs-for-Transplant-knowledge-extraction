Abstract
CO is produced in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)
by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). CO increases cGMP levels
in VSMC; however, its possible additional roles in the vascu￾lature have not been examined. We report that a product
of HO, released from VSMC and inhibited by hemoglobin,
has paracrine effects on endothelial cells: it increases endo￾thelial cGMP content and decreases the expression of the
mitogens, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and platelet-derived growth
factor-B (PDGF-B). This product has the characteristics of
CO, and its production is increased sevenfold under hyp￾oxia. The VSMC-derived CO caused a fourfold rise in endo￾thelial cell cGMP. In addition, it inhibited the hypoxia-in￾duced increases in mRNA levels of the ET-1 and PDGF-B
genes. Inhibitors of HO, and hemoglobin, a scavenger of CO,
prevented the rise in cGMP and also restored the hypoxic
response of these genes. The inhibition of ET-1 and PDGF￾B mRNA by CO resulted in decreased production of these
endothelial-derived mitogens, and in turn, inhibition of
VSMC proliferation. These findings suggest an important
physiologic role for VSMC-derived CO in modulating cell￾cell interaction and cell proliferation in the vessel wall dur￾ing hypoxia. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:2676-2682.) Key

Introduction
Endothelial-derived NO maintains normal vascular tone through
the regulation of cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC).' Increased cellular cGMP causes relaxation of VSMC
and may affect permeability and coagulant function in endothe￾lial cells (1, 2). We reported that CO, a molecule similar to

NO, is synthesized by rat VSMC and is responsible for increas￾ing cGMP levels in these cells under hypoxic conditions (3).
These findings suggest that endogenous CO plays an important
role in regulating vascular tone.
Hypoxia has profound effects on vascular tone, endothelial
permeability, and coagulant function (4, 5). It mediates these
effects partly by regulating the transcription and release of vaso￾active mediators in vascular cells. For instance, the expression
of such vasoactive agents as endothelin-l (ET-1) and platelet￾derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) is dramatically induced in
endothelial cells exposed to low oxygen tension (6, 7), and
similarly, vascular endothelial growth factor is induced in
smooth muscle cells (8, 9). Hypoxia can affect both endothelial
and VSMC gene expression independently, and the factors re￾leased in this setting can modulate endothelial-VSMC interac￾tions leading to a number of vascular disorders including vaso￾constriction and excessive proliferation of VSMC, edema in the
lung, and thrombus formation in the venous circulation.
Hypoxia also increases the transcriptional rate of the heme
oxygenase- 1 (HO-1) gene in VSMC causing a net increase in
enzymatic activity (3). HO-1 catalyzes the breakdown of heme
to CO and biliverdin and hence regulates both heme homeostasis
in the body and CO levels in VSMC. We have shown that
VSMC-derived CO increases cGMP levels in VSMC under
conditions of hypoxia (3). However, additional effects of CO
on vascular cells have not been investigated.
Using a coculture system of endothelial cells and VSMC,
we designed this study to examine the autocrine and paracrine
effects of VSMC-derived CO on these two vascular cell types
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
Methods
Cell culture. Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were used for the endothelial cell layer because we have
previously characterized the expression of ET-1 and PDGF-B in these
cells in response to hypoxia. They were subcultured on gelatin-coated
plates in the presence of heparin (15 U/ml) and endothelial growth
supplement (2.5 mg/ 100 ml media; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO) in medium 199 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) with
20% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) at 37°C, 5% C02, in a
humidified incubator. Cells were passaged by trypsinization with
0.025% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco Laboratories) every 3-4 d and were used
between passages 5 and 10. Rat aortic VSMC were used as they were
shown to produce CO (3). VSMC and primary cultures of bovine aortic
endothelial cells (BAECs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DME) (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) with 10% FBS
(Hyclone Laboratories) and were passaged similarly. The hypoxic gas
mixture (95% N2, 5% C02) was preanalyzed and infused into airtight
incubators with inflow and outflow valves (Billups-Rothenberg, Del
Mar, CA) at a flow rate of 3 liters/min for 15 min/d as previously (7).
Coculture system. HUVECs, BAECs, and VSMC were cultured sep￾arately in Transwell plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), and when
starting coculture, media were changed to 1% FBS/DME. VSMC were
plated at the bottom and endothelial cells were grown on the insert

above. The ratio of endothelial cells to VSMC during coculture was
1:3.
RNA analysis. Total cellular RNA was prepared by guanidinium
isothiocyanate extraction from HUVECs, BAECs, or VSMC exposed
to normoxia and hypoxia for various periods. Total RNA (15 mg/lane)
was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing formal￾dehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by blotting. The
filters were hybridized with cDNA probes specific for the rat HO-I gene
(3), the human ET-l (hET-l) and bovine ET-l (bET-i) genes (10),
and the human transforming growth factor /3 (TGF,6) gene (11). The
probe for the PDGF-B chain gene was the 1,300-bp DNA fragment of
simian sarcoma virus clone C60 encoding the v-sis oncogene (12).
The cDNA fragments were labeled with [a-32P]dCTP using a standard
random-primed reaction to a specific activity of 1-2 x 109 cpm/,g.
The membranes were hybridized for 2 h at 680C in QuikHyb solution
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 2 x 106 cpm/ml of probe, and washed
twice in 2x SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min,
followed by 0.1x SSC/0.1% SDS at 60C for 30 min, and were then
exposed to film (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) with
intensifying screens at -800C. The membranes were subsequently
stripped and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled, 800-bp PstI fragment of
the mouse /3-actin gene. For quantitation, we scanned autoradiographs
with a laser densitometer (Ultroscan XL; LKB Instruments Inc.,
Bromma, Sweden) running the Gel Scan XL software package (Phar￾macia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ).
Measurement ofET-J peptide levels in conditioned media. HUVECs
were exposed to hypoxia alone, or hypoxia plus tin protoporphyrin IX
(SnPP-9), hemoglobin (Hb), or Nw-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) in the
presence or absence of VSMC for various periods from 6 to 48 h.
Parallel cultures were maintained under normoxic conditions. The media
conditioned by HUVECs alone or HUVECs with VSMC were collected,
spun to remove cells, and kept frozen at -20°C until assay. ET-l peptide
was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Corp., Arling￾ton Heights, IL) with a detection limit of I0--5 grams/ml. The antiserum
used in this assay does not cross-react with big endothelin. ET-1 produc￾tion is shown as ET-1 concentration per cell number (pM/I05 cell).
Measurement of carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) levels in conditioned
media. Relative amounts of CO released into the media were measured
by adding Hb for the last hour of incubation and quantifying HbCO
levels spectrophotometrically using a CO-oximeter (Coming 270; Ciba
Coming Diagnostics, Medfield, MA). HbCO gives maximal absorbance
at a wavelength of 569 nm and is calculated as the percentage of total
Hb. The appropriate amount of Hb was determined from a standard
curve using exogenous CO and varying amounts of Hb over a range of
concentrations where the absorbance was linear.
VSMC replication. Cell replication was assessed by counting cells
cultured in the Transwell system. After various incubation periods, cells
were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and centrifuged. Cell
pellets were resuspended with ice-cold PBS and counted with a Coulter
counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). To determine whether ET-1 or
PDGF-B were active in stimulating VSMC replication, polyclonal anti￾bodies to ET-l (1:4,000 dilution) and PDGF (25 Og/ml) were added
from the beginning of coculture. The concentrations of antibodies were
determined empirically.
cGMP accumulation in hypoxia-exposed HUVECs. To determine
the relationship between cGMP concentration and the production of CO
by VSMC, HUVECs were exposed to hypoxia for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h
and cGMP concentrations were determined at each time point, in the
presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine (1
mM) added to the media 20 min before obtaining cell extracts. The
effect of SnPP-9 on hypoxia-induced cGMP accumulation was evaluated
by exposing cells to hypoxia for 12 h and adding SnPP-9 to give a final
concentration of 10 ,uM or 1 mM in the media, 1 h before the end of
the exposure period. To examine if the CO generated from VSMC
regulates cGMP levels, we added Hb to give a final concentration of 1
or 50 jLM to the cultures 1 h before the end of the exposure period, and
cGMP concentration was determined. To eliminate the role of NO on
hypoxia-induced cGMP accumulation, cells were incubated in L-argi￾nine-free medium for 24 h and then exposed to hypoxia for 12 h. The
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NNA (2.5 mM) was added to
plates 1 h before the end of the exposure period, and cGMP concentra￾tion was determined in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine.
Measurement of cGMP concentration. cGMP was extracted from
the cells by rapid aspiration of medium, ice-cold PBS washes, and the
addition of ice-cold ethanol to give a final concentration of 65%. The
cells were harvested and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4TC. Super￾natant was transferred to fresh tubes, evaporated under 60'C vacuum
oven until completely dry, and kept at -800C until assay. The cGMP
concentration in cell extracts was determined by radioimmunoassay
(Amersham Corp.). cGMP concentration was normalized to protein
content as determined by a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) using bovine serum albumin as standard.
Reagents. SnPP-9, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP-9), and cobalt
protoporphyrin IX (CoPP-9) were purchased from Porphyrin Products,
Inc. (Logan, UT). A polyclonal antibody to human ET-1, which showed
no cross-reactivity with big endothelin, ET-2, or ET-3, was obtained
from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Polyclonal antibody to
human PDGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake
Placid, NY). All other reagents used were obtained from Sigma Chemi￾cal Co. unless otherwise specified. Pure Hb was prepared by treatment
with excess reducing agents as described previously (3).
Data analysis. Significant differences were determined by one-way
ANOVA and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Hypoxia increases HO-I mRNA levels in VSMC and not in
endothelial cells. We reported that VSMC cultured under hyp￾oxic conditions express significantly higher levels of HO-I than
normoxic cells. To determine the expression of HO-I by VSMC
grown in the presence of endothelial cells, HUVECs were cocul￾tured with rat aortic VSMC under hypoxia and RNA was iso￾lated from each cell layer after various time periods of coculture.
Under these hypoxic conditions, the Po2 measured in the media
was 18-20 mmHg, as we reported previously (3). Northern
blot analysis of VSMC RNA is shown in Fig. 1 A and HUVEC
RNA in Fig. 1 B. HO-1 mRNA levels were induced sevenfold
in VSMC exposed to hypoxia for 12 h while in the presence
of endothelial cells. In contrast, HO-1 mRNA levels in the
cocultured HUVEC were progressively suppressed under the
same hypoxic conditions. Levels of ,B-actin mRNA are shown
below HO-1. The relative mRNA levels of HO-1 indicated are
normalized to those of /3-actin for the corresponding time points.
The time course of hypoxia-induced HO-1 mRNA in VSMC
cocultured with HUVECs was found to be the same as described
previously on VSMC cultured alone (3).
Kinetics of CO production by VSMC in coculture. We have
shown that increased HO-I mRNA results in increased HO-1
activity manifested by the increased release of CO (3). To
determine the production of CO by VSMC grown in the pres￾ence of endothelial cells and to examine the kinetics of its
release, relative CO levels in conditioned media were deter￾mined as formed HbCO and measured spectrophotometrically.
Fig. 2 shows the relative amounts of HbCO in media condi￾tioned by VSMC in the presence of HUVECs and compared
with levels in media of endothelial cells cultured alone. After
hypoxic exposure for 12 h, HbCO levels in the conditioned
media of VSMC cocultured with HUVECs were increased sev￾enfold above the levels in normoxic conditioned media and
declined to twofold by 48 h hypoxia. In contrast, HUVECs did
not produce CO, as shown by the absence of HbCO in condi￾tioned media of cells cultured alone under either oxygen condi￾Paracrine Effects of Smooth Muscle Cell-derived Carbon Monoxide 2677

tion. The CO in the conditioned media of cocultured endothelial
and VSMC is therefore produced by the VSMC with maximal
amounts released after 12 h of hypoxia.
Hypoxic VSMC increase cGMP levels in HUVECs. VSMC￾derived CO was shown to regulate cGMP levels in VSMC
under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (3). We thus examined
whether VSMC-derived CO can regulate cGMP levels in the
adjacent endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, cGMP levels
in HUVECs alone were not changed under either normoxic or
hypoxic conditions during the indicated periods. In contrast,

cGMP levels in HUVECs cocultured with VSMC were dramati￾cally increased at 12 h of hypoxia and declined subsequently.
The time course of the increase in cGMP levels was essentially
similar to the time course of CO release in the conditioned
media. cGMP levels were slightly but significantly elevated in
HUVECs cocultured with VSMC under normoxic conditions
compared with levels in cells cultured alone. To examine the
role of CO in increasing endothelial cell cGMP levels, we added
SnPP-9 (an inhibitor of CO synthesis) to the cultures. As shown
in Fig. 3 B, SnPP-9 lowered cGMP levels in HUVECs in a dose￾dependent manner under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
Since metalloporphyrins have been reported to inhibit guanylyl
cyclase (13) as well as HO, the suppression of cGMP may be
independent of HO activity. We therefore added Hb, a scavenger
of CO and NO, to the cultures and found that it suppressed

cGMP dose-dependently. Using L-NNA, we eliminated the role
of NO on endothelial cell cGMP production (as also shown by
others [14]), demonstrating that it is an HO product, most
likely CO, that is the regulator of cGMP under these coculture
conditions.
VSMC suppress the hypoxia-induced increases in ET-I and
PDGF-B mRNA in HUVECs. Exogenous administration of CO
inhibits the hypoxia-induced increases in the expression of the
ET-1, PDGF-B, and vascular endothelial growth factor genes
(15, 16). We investigated whether CO at the physiologic con￾centration released by VSMC could have similar effects on
endothelial cell gene expression. First we examined whether
the presence of VSMC could regulate ET-1 and PDGF-B gene
expression on adjacent endothelial cells. HUVECs cocultured
with VSMC were exposed to hypoxia for various periods. The
parallel cultures were maintained in the absence of VSMC.
Northern blot analysis of HUVEC RNA showed that in the
absence of VSMC, ET-1 mRNA levels increased fourfold by
12 h of hypoxia and sevenfold by 48 h above control levels
(Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). In contrast, ET-1 mRNA
in HUVECs cocultured with VSMC was not induced until 24
h of hypoxia (less than twofold; Fig. 4 A, lane 8) and the
maximal induction was fivefold above control levels at 48 h
(Fig. 4 A, lane 9). The middle panel of Fig. 4 A shows that
the hypoxia-induced increases in PDGF-B mRNA were also
suppressed by the presence of VSMC in a pattern similar to
those of ET-1 mRNA. In contrast, the levels of TGF,6 mRNA
expression were not altered by VSMC under the same hypoxic
conditions (data not shown). These findings suggest that the
factor responsible for suppressing hypoxia-induced increases in
ET- 1 and PDGF-B mRNA is produced from VSMC in the early
hypoxic period and its production decreases by 48 h of hypoxia.
Furthermore, its effects are specific for the ET-1 and PDGF-B
genes, that is, genes regulated by hypoxia in these cells. A
similar pattern of ET-1 expression was observed when VSMC
were cocultured with BAECs (Fig. 4 B), indicating that VSMC
can alter gene expression in endothelial cells derived from the
same or different vascular beds as the smooth muscle cells
themselves. Fig. 4 C demonstrates graphically the relative
changes in mRNA levels of the hET-1, bET-1, and PDGF-B
genes in hypoxic endothelial cells incubated alone or in cocul￾ture with VSMC for 48 h.
An HO-dependent factor produced by VSMC and inhibited
by Hb suppresses the hypoxia-induced increases in ET-J mRNA
in HUVECs. VSMC specifically suppressed the expression of
hypoxia-responsive genes in endothelial cells with a time course
similar to CO release, indicating that VSMC-derived CO may
be the factor responsible for this phenomenon. To examine this,
we added Hb, which is a scavenger of CO, or SnPP-9, a potent
inhibitor of HO, to the cultures. Furthermore, to eliminate NO
as the molecule mediating the suppression of the increases in
ET-1 mRNA, we added L-NNA to the cultures, since NO is
reported to have the same effect on these genes as CO (15).
Fig. 5 A shows Northern blot analysis of RNA from HUVECs
exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 12 h in the presence or
absence of Hb, SnPP-9, or L-NNA. Under normoxia, neither
VSMC nor these reagents had any significant effect on the levels
of ET-1 mRNA expression by the endothelial cells (Fig. 5 A,
lanes 1-5). In contrast, under hypoxia, SnPP-9 (Fig. 5 A, lane
8) and Hb (lane 10) reversed the effect of cocultured VSMC
on endothelial cells, such that ET-1 mRNA was expressed at
high levels, similar to those in HUVECs cultured alone (lane

in this coculture system. We tested additional inhibitors of HO
and found that, as was the case with SnPP-9, ZnPP-9 and CoPP￾9 reversed the effects of coculture on ET-1 mRNA levels,
allowing for higher expression under hypoxia as in cells cultured
alone (Fig. 5 B). Hemin, however, an inducer of HO, sup￾pressed ET-1 mRNA levels in cocultured endothelial cells.
Taken together, these findings suggest that CO, the product of
HO, released by hypoxic VSMC into the conditioned media is
responsible for the suppression of hypoxia-induced increases in
ET-1 mRNA expression.
VSMC inhibit the hypoxia-mediated increases in ET-] se￾cretion. To determine whether ET-1 protein accompanies
changes in ET-1 gene expression, we measured ET-1 peptide
levels in the conditioned media. HUVECs exposed to hypoxia
secreted twofold greater ET-1 protein than those in normoxia
by 12 h and fourfold by 24 h (Fig. 6 A, solid lines). In contrast,
ET-l peptide levels in conditioned media of HUVECs cocul￾tured with VSMC were low, comparable with normoxic control
levels at both 12 and 24 h of hypoxia (Fig. 6 A, dotted lines).
By 48 h of hypoxia, ET-1 levels in the media of HUVECs
cocultured with VSMC increased to threefold above normoxic
control levels, but were still less than the levels in the media
of hypoxic HUVECs cultured alone. These changes in the kinet￾ics of ET-1 protein production by endothelial cells paralleled
those in ET-1 mRNA expression under coculture conditions.
To examine whether CO may be responsible for the decreased
production of ET-1, we added SnPP-9 or Hb to the cultures.
L-NNA was added to examine the effect of NO. Fig. 6 B shows
the resulting ET-1 peptide levels in the media of cells cocultured
for 12 h under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, in the presence
or absence of these agents. Under normoxia, ET- 1 peptide levels
were not altered with these reagents in coculture. Under hyp￾oxia, ET-1 levels were elevated twofold in HUVECs cocultured
with VSMC but only in the presence of Hb and SnPP-9. These
effects of Hb and SnPP-9 on ET-1 peptide are essentially similar
to those on ET-l gene expression and suggest that CO, the
product of HO, decreases the production of ET- 1 from endothe￾lial cells. Due to the low amounts of PDGF-BB relative to the
other PDGF dimers released in the medium of HUVEC (17),
PDGF-BB activity was detected in coculture by neutralizing
antibody studies described below.
A product of HO alters VSMC replication predominantly
through the regulation of ET-J and PDGF-BB production. The
above data indicate that VSMC exposed to hypoxia for 12 h
release about fivefold greater amounts of CO into their medium
than cells exposed to hypoxia for 48 h and suggest that CO,
the product of HO, may be the factor responsible for suppressing
the production of ET-1 and PDGF-B in endothelial cells. PDGF￾A is not affected by hypoxia or CO (6). Both ET-1 and PDGF￾BB proteins are known to have a potent proliferative effect on
SMC (18, 19). We thus inhibited the formation of CO with
SnPP-9 and examined VSMC proliferation in the presence of
endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 7, coculture with HUVECs
under normoxic or hypoxic conditions increased the number of
VSMC slightly to 1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively, above control
levels at 24 h. SnPP-9, the inhibitor of HO, had no additional
effect on VSMC number under normoxia (Fig. 7, compare bars
3 and 1), however, replication of VSMC was stimulated almost
threefold with SnPP-9 in hypoxia. To confirm that the stimula￾tion in the presence of SnPP-9 was mediated by ET- I or PDGF￾BB released from endothelial cells, polyclonal antibodies to ET￾1 and PDGF were added to the cultures. Anti-PDGF and anti￾ET-1 together (Fig. 7, bar 5) reduced the VSMC proliferative
response markedly to levels of VSMC cultured in the absence
of this HO-inhibitor (bar 2). Either antibody alone had only a
partial effect on inhibiting VSMC growth in coculture and nei￾ther affected the replication rate of VSMC cultured alone (data
not shown). These findings suggest that a diffusible factor,
generated from hypoxic VSMC and readily inhibited by SnPP￾9, reduced the proliferation of VSMC by suppressing ET-1 and
PDGF-BB production in cocultured endothelial cells.

rived, have been thought to modulate the effects of hypoxia on
vascular tone. Hypoxia alters the expression of many mamma￾lian genes. It increases ET-1, PDGF-B, and IL, expression (6,
7, 20) and decreases NO production in endothelial cells (21).
The perturbation of these vasoconstrictors and vasodilators af￾fects endothelial-smooth muscle cell interactions, leading to
hypoxia-related vascular disorders, including excess prolifera￾tion and constriction of smooth muscle cells, as well as in￾creased permeability and coagulant function of endothelial cells
(5). Although the VSMC layer can contract in response to
hypoxia in the absence of the endothelium (22), little is known
about VSMC-derived vasoactive substances and their role in
modulating vessel tone. We have reported previously that
VSMC produce large amounts of CO under hypoxic conditions,
resulting in elevated intracellular cGMP levels (3). VSMC may
thus serve to regulate local tone by releasing molecules such
as CO that modulate the action of the endothelial-derived va￾somediators on the smooth muscle cells.

we report here that VSMC-derived CO may regulate VSMC
proliferation indirectly, by suppressing the production of the
endothelial cell-derived mitogens, ET-1 and PDGF-BB. An
earlier report had shown that ET-1 release is inhibited in endo￾thelial cells by coculture with cells of vascular media via an
unidentified transferable factor (23). We found that under basal,
normoxic conditions, ET-1 and PDGF-B production was unaf￾fected by coculture. However, under hypoxic conditions, a fac￾tor released by VSMC suppressed the induction of both genes.
Our findings suggest that this factor is CO generated from
VSMC via HO-1, since the effect of this factor was abolished
by metalloporphyrins which are potent inhibitors of HO, and
by Hb, a scavenger of CO, in a dose-dependent manner. In
addition, we showed that VSMC-derived CO may control
VSMC growth by suppressing ET-1 and PDGF-BB production:
SnPP-9, the inhibitor of CO synthesis, stimulated the prolifera￾tion of VSMC, whereas antibodies to PDGF and ET-1 reduced
VSMC growth in the presence of SnPP-9. This is the first report
to show that endogenous CO generated by VSMC may regulate
endothelial function, which, in turn, affects VSMC growth via
feedback mechanisms.
This VSMC-derived factor inhibited by Hb, but unaffected
by L-NNA, also increased cGMP levels in cocultured endothe￾lial cells under basal conditions and more dramatically under
stimulated conditions of hypoxia. The predominant effect of
increased endothelial cell cGMP levels may be the control of
endothelial barrier function and platelet adhesion under both
basal and hypoxic conditions ( 1, 24, 25 ). Elevated cGMP levels
have been reported to inhibit the thrombin-induced increases in
ET-1 production (26). However, the effects of VSMC-derived
CO on ET-1 and PDGF-B are not mediated by cGMP because
neither methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, nor 8-
bromo-cGMP addition to the cultures affects the hypoxic induc￾tion of the ET-1 and PDGF-B genes, as we have reported pre￾viously (15).
CO shares some of the properties of NO. Both are gas
molecules normally produced in the body and capable of bind￾ing and activating guanylyl cyclase. Both molecules have been
implicated as neuronal messengers in the brain (27, 28). NO
Paracrine Effects of Smooth Muscle Cell-derived Carbon Monoxide 2681

has been reported to affect the production of ET-1 and PDGF￾B in HUVECs under both basal and stimulated conditions ( 15 ).
In this study, we showed that CO suppressed ET-1 and PDGF￾B gene expression under hypoxic conditions; however, the basal
levels of these genes were unaffected by CO. NO has been
shown to inhibit cell growth directly by affecting cell cycle
events (29). Our findings suggest that VSMC-derived CO may
alter VSMC growth indirectly through the regulation of ET-1
and PDGF-B. Further experiments are being conducted to clar￾ify the mechanisms by which CO may regulate cell growth
directly.
We speculate that, in the normal vasculature, the basal pro￾duction of CO may be lower than NO. Unlike NO, CO is a less
potent vasodilator than NO (30) and may not be the predomi￾nant regulator of vessel integrity under basal conditions. How￾ever, once the production of NO in endothelial cells is impaired
for any reason, such as hypoxia, VSMC-derived CO may take
over as the important regulator of gene expression and cGMP
levels in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Addi￾tionally, by binding to the heme group of NOS, hypoxia-induced
CO may shut down electron flow through the enzyme, leading
to further suppression of NOS and NO formation. In this man￾ner, the CO produced by VSMC may play an important physio￾logic role in regulating endothelial-smooth muscle cell interac￾tions in response to hypoxia and modulating blood vessel tone.
