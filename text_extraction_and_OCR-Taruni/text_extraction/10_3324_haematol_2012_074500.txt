Lymphoproliferative Disorders
Introduction
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) com￾prises a wide spectrum of lymphoproliferative conditions fol￾lowing solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplanta￾tion.
1 The disorder represents an important cause of morbidity
and mortality in transplant recipients. The strongest risk factors
for occurrence of PTLD are primary Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-
infection, type of transplanted organ, T-cell depletion, and total
burden of immunosuppression.
2,3
Current diagnosis of PTLD is based on clinical and biochem￾ical suspicion and (at least in some cases) on increasing EBV
viral replication rates, with tissue biopsy being the gold stan￾dard. Following diagnosis, disease staging is performed by
means of conventional computed tomography (CT) scanning,
bone marrow biopsy and, in case of clinical evidence, central
nervous system imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination.
However, diagnosis and staging of PTLD is characterized by
some specific difficulties. Firstly, obtaining a representative tis￾sue biopsy is not always easy due to severe thrombocytopenia,
especially in the case of hematopoietic stem cell transplanta￾tion. Secondly, many physicians tend to start therapy (either
reduction of immunosuppression or a monoclonal anti-CD20
antibody such as rituximab) in an early phase before all diag￾nostic procedures have been performed. Finally, PTLD is often
characterized by frequent extranodal involvement, rendering

We investigated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 18F-flu￾orodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in 170 cases with suspected or biopsy-proven posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder. All solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who underwent an
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan between 2003 and 2010 in our center for the indica￾tion posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, were retrospectively reviewed and results were compared with
tissue biopsy whenever possible. One hundred and seventy positron emission tomography scans in 150 patients
were eligible for evaluation. In 45 cases, the patient had a biopsy-confirmed posttransplant lymphoproliferative
disorder before positron emission tomography scanning and positron emission tomography was performed for
staging purposes. In the remaining 125 cases, positron emission tomography was performed to differentiate
between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and other diseases. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake was
quantitatively expressed by calculation of maximum and mean standardized uptake value in the most intense
lesion or, in the absence of attenuation corrected positron emission tomography scans, by comparing uptake in
target lesion to liver and mediastinal uptake. We found an overall sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 89%, positive
predictive value of 91% and negative predictive value of 87% for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder
detection by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. In a subanalysis of the 125 scans performed
for differentiating posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder from other diseases, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and negative predictive value were 90%, 89%, 85% and 93%, respectively. 18F-fluorodeoxyglu￾cose-uptake in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was generally high with a median mean and maxi￾mum standardized uptake value of 9.0 (range 2.0-18.6) and 17.4 (range 2.6-26.4). Posttransplant lymphoprolifera￾tive disorder often had an atypical presentation on positron emission tomography with high incidence of extran￾odal involvement. In conclusion, from these data, we can conclude that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography is highly sensitive for detecting posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and has an excellent abil￾ity to differentiate posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder from non-malignant diseases.
ABSTRACT

conventional CT scan less appropriate for adequate staging
and less suitable for image-guided biopsy.
Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET) combined with CT has emerged as
the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diag￾nosis and staging of both Hodgkin’s and different subtypes
of aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
4 The role of FDG￾PET scan in PTLD, however, has not yet been established.
Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy and clinical per￾formance of FDG-PET scan in the diagnosis of PTLD in a
large cohort of transplant recipients.
Design and Methods
Data collection
We conducted a monocentric retrospective analysis of all
solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi￾ents who underwent a PET scan between January 2003 and
December 2010 in order to confirm or to eliminate the clin￾ical and/or biochemical suspicion of PTLD.
Positron emission tomography (PET)
FDG-PET scanning was performed from the skull to the
mid-thigh. In the first years of this survey, only non-attenu￾ated PET scans (Siemens ECAT HR+) were available. In 73
(43%) and 97 (57%) cases, a PET scan without CT or a
combined PET/CT scan were performed, respectively.
Scanning protocol has changed slightly over time since the
introduction of a hybrid PET/CT imaging system (Biograph
40 TruePoint with True V, Siemens Medical Solutions).
Standard administered FDG-dose was 4 x body weight (kg)
+ 20 MBq in all patients.
All PET scans were evaluated by 2 experienced nuclear
physicians (LB and RV) and blindly scored visually accord￾ing to a 4-point scale. In cases in which no arguments for
lymphoma were withheld, a score of 0 was allocated; if
only a few arguments could be retrieved, a score of 1 was
given. This was often the case when the reviewer was in
doubt of inflammatory changes. A score of 2 was reserved
if there was a clear preference for lymphoma and, finally,
when PET scan was very suggestive for lymphoma, a score
of 3 was allocated. In order to improve and facilitate the
interpretation scores, 0 and 1 were considered ‘PET nega￾tive’, while scores 2 and 3 were designated as ‘PET positive’.
For every attenuation corrected PET scan, mean and maxi￾mum standardized uptake value (SUV) was determined.
SUV mean was determined by a visual 3D-delineation of
the most active lesion undoubtedly attributed to PTLD. For
non-attenuated PET, FDG intensity was compared to medi￾astinal and liver uptake. Whenever possible, results of the
PET scan were compared to histological data. All biopsies
were reviewed by 3 expert hematopathologists (CDWP, XS,
TT) and, in case of PTLD, classified according to the WHO
2008 classification.
1 In ideal circumstances, a biopsy of all
suspected lesions should have been obtained. However,
from a practical and ethical point of view, this was rarely
possible. In cases in which a tissue biopsy was lacking, cor￾relations between the PET results and the findings on CT
scan and clinical characteristics were performed. The final
diagnosis of PTLD in patients without biopsy was consid￾ered unlikely if another cause of biochemical/clinical PTLD
suspicion was found, or if rapid spontaneous regression
occurred without any intervention. Besides PET data, base￾line characteristics of the patients were collected from the
medical files. These included the type of transplantation,
the presence of clinical symptoms (fever, night sweats,
weight loss, pain, fatigue) and biochemical abnormalities
(elevated lactate dehydrogenase, anemia, leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, Epstein Barr virus viral load). Clinical
symptoms and biochemical abnormalities were considered
to be present if at least one clinical symptom or biochemical
abnormality was observed. This study was approved by the
Ethical Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven and
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical analysis
Sensitivity was defined as: [number of true positive
cases]/[total number of true positive and false negative
cases]). Specificity was defined as: [number of true negative
cases]/[total number of false positive and true negative
cases]. Positive predictive value was defined as: PPV, [num￾ber of true positive cases]/[total number of true positive and
false positive cases]. Negative predictive value (NPV) was
defined as: [number of true negative cases]/[total number of
true negative and false negative cases]. Overall accuracy
[total number of true positive and true negative cases] / [all
cases]) was calculated for different settings of PET imaging.
PPV and NPV were only defined for this particular studied
population. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on
the binomial distribution were calculated for each of these
indices. Separate analyses were performed for the evalua￾tion of PET as: a) a tool for the detection of lesions of suspect￾ed PTLD (all patients); b) a tool for the differentiation of PTLD
versus other diseases (no biopsy-confirmed diagnosis before
PET scan); and c) a staging tool for biopsy-confirmed PTLD
(before PET scan was performed).
Results
Between January 2003 and December 2010, 240 PET
scans were performed for the indication PTLD. After a first
selection, which was performed by revising the initial clin￾ical request forms and ensuring the quality of data for cor￾rect interpretation, 185 scans remained. Afterwards, a sec￾ond selection excluded an additional 15 PET scans. The
main reason for exclusion during the second selection was
the inability to obtain a correct diagnosis based on histology
or clinical characteristics in 8 patients. Three patients with
one single PTLD localization had a PET scan following
resection, whereas in 2 patients a second malignancy was
diagnosed at the same time. Finally, two PET scans were
excluded because of the different characteristics of the lym￾phoproliferative disorder: one patient had an indolent NHL
occurring more than twenty years following transplanta￾tion, whereas in another patient the lymphoproliferative
disorder was already present before transplantation, as pre￾viously published.
5 In 10 patients, two episodes of PTLD
suspicion were reported, and in 5 patients, three different
PET scans (at different time points) were recorded.
Eventually, a final evaluation was made on 170 PET scans in
150 different transplant patients.
In 45 (26.5%) of the 170 selected PET scans a biopsy-con￾firmed diagnosis of PTLD was made before the PET scan
was performed. In these cases, PET was considered as stag￾ing tool. In the remaining 125 (73.5%) cases, PTLD was sus￾pected but not confirmed at time of PET scan.
Male:female ratio was 1.5:1 which is an exact reflection
of the gender distribution of transplant recipients in our

center (60% males). Median time between transplantation
and PET scan was 68.71 months (range 1-322). The majori￾ty of PET scans were performed in kidney transplant recip￾ients (34%), followed by liver (15%), lung (15%), heart
(15%), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (15%), combined
(5%) and bowel (1%) transplant recipients. Table 1 shows
the different clinical and biochemical characteristics of the
study cases. A biopsy was obtained in 119 (70%) cases.
Biopsy-proven PTLD cases included early lesions in 11
(12%), polymorphic PTLD in 3 (3%), diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) type monomorphic PTLD in 64 (69%),
non-DLBCL type monomorphic PTLD in 12 (13%), and
Hodgkin-like PTLD in 3 (3%) cases.
Table 2A shows data on sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of
PET scan for the detection of PTLD in all 170 PET scans.
Table 2B shows sensitivity for the 45 patients in whom the
diagnosis of PTLD was already confirmed before PET scan
(staging indication). Finally, Table 2C shows the same
parameters of the remaining 125 patients who had PET for
differentiating PTLD versus other disease. False positive
results (n=8) were mainly due to infectious (3 cases) or
inflammatory conditions (3 cases). In the 2 remaining cases,
diagnosis remained unknown but PTLD was considered
very unlikely due to spontaneous regression without any
therapeutic intervention. False negative results (n=10) were
mainly reported in limited stage early lesions (4 cases), with
2 cases presenting with respectively isolated (kidney and
heart) graft localization. Other subtypes presenting with
negative PET scan included early stage diffuse large B-cell
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (3 cases), primary central nerv￾ous system PTLD (2 cases) and limited stage Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (1 case).
Visualized lesions on PET scan showed an intense FDG
uptake with a median mean standardized uptake value
(SUV) of 9.0 (range 2.0-18.6) and a median maximum SUV
of 17.4 (range 2.6-26.4). Atypical extranodal presentation
was a frequent finding with diffuse pulmonary involve￾ment, gastrointestinal lesions and kidney, bone, liver,
spleen, muscle and skin invasion (Figures 1, 2 and 3).
Discussion
Historically long-term outcome of solid organ and
hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was limited
by low graft and patient survival, mainly due to acute organ
rejection, acute graft-versus-host disease and infectious com￾plications. However, due to improvement in immunosup￾pressive therapy and clinical prophylactic management
strategies, overall outcome has improved. Posttransplant
malignancies and cardiovascular disorders have emerged as
the most important long-term complications, in particular,
following solid organ transplantation. The incidence of
malignancies in solid organ transplant patients is estimated
to be 20% after ten years of chronic immunosuppression.
6
Skin cancer and lymphoproliferative disorders are the two
most frequent malignancies in this specific patient popula￾tion.
7
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a
rare but life-threatening disorder, characterized by an
uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes, caused by
immunosuppressive drug-induced diminished immune sur￾veillance. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) 2008 classification, PTLD can be classified into
early lesions, polymorphic PTLD, monomorphic PTLD and
Hodgkin-like PTLD.

Metabolic imaging with FDG-PET, combined with CT is
widely accepted for the diagnosis and staging of both
Hodgkin’s and different subtypes of aggressive non￾Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
4 The role of PET scan in PTLD, how￾ever, is less clear.
The staging system most frequently used for lymphoma
is the Ann Arbor classification, classifying patients based on
the number of involved lymph node regions, the localiza￾tion of nodal involvement and the presence of organ inva￾sion.
8 However, as extranodal involvement is a frequent fea￾ture of PTLD, CT scan may not be the most appropriate
staging tool. Another potential problem is the need for
intravenous contrast with CT, which is relatively contra￾indicated in transplant patients due to the relative frequent
co-existing renal (allograft) impairment.
9 These drawbacks
have stimulated growing interest in the use of FDG-PET for
detecting and staging of PTLD. However, as PET scan lacks
anatomic detail, recent years have seen the development of
hybrid PET/CT and this is now considered state of the art
imaging for both staging and response assessment in
DLBCL and HL.
4,10
Experience with the use of PET in PTLD has been limited
to case reports and rather small single-center case series.
11-17
These reports reveal that PET scan may have a high sensi￾tivity for the detection of PTLD lesions. Our study included
a large number of transplant patients for whom a PET scan
was ordered because of clinical PTLD suspicion (diagnostic
PET scan) or biopsy-proven PTLD (staging PET scan) and
showed a high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value and negative predictive value. However, probably due
to specific immunosuppression-related problems, PET scan
seems more difficult to interpret compared to metabolic
imaging of lymphomas occurring in immunocompetent
patients. These problems include the presence of diffuse
pulmonary involvement, non-typical organ invasion and
concomitant infectious problems. These difficulties seem
comparable to those observed in PET scans in HIV associat￾ed lymphomas, with HIV-associated nodal reactive hyper￾plasia and infections confounding correct PET interpreta￾tion.
18
From a clinical point of view, the high sensitivity is impor￾tant. However, three specific problems leading to false neg￾ative results need to be taken into account. Firstly, although
not considered real PTLD according to the WHO 2008 clas￾D. Dierickx et al.
774 haematologica | 2013; 98(5)
Figure 1. A 64-year old man presented with infiltrative skin lesions
ten years following second kidney transplantation. Transaxial FDG￾PET, CT and fused PET/CT images of the skull (left), maximum inten￾sity projection (center) and histology of subcutaneous nodule (right).
FDG PET/CT showed multiple cutaneous lesions (white arrow) and
both axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathies. Skin biopsy revealed
a CD8-positive epidermotropic EBV-negative T-cell lymphoprolifera￾tive disorder, extending in the subcutis, compatible with a monomor￾phic cytotoxic T-cell PTLD. SUV: standardized uptake value.
Figure 2. A 28 year-old woman presented with asymptomatic pul￾monary nodules associated with increasing EBV viral load in the
peripheral blood four months following lung transplantation.
Transaxial FDG-PET, CT and fused PET/CT images of the chest (left),
maximum intensity projection (center) and histology of pulmonary
nodule (right). FDG PET/CT showed a bilobar pulmonary nodule in the
right lung (white arrow) and a lesion in the liver and left chest wall.
Histological analysis of a core needle biopsy of the pulmonary nodule
revealed an EBV-driven diffuse large CD20-positive lymphoid prolifer￾ation, compatible with a monomorphic PTLD, type DLBCL, NOS of non￾germinal center B-cell origin. SUV: standardized uptake value.
Figure 3. A 44-years old man presented with bone pain and B symp￾toms 14 years following kidney transplantation. Transaxial FDG-PET,
CT and fused PET/CT images of the scrotum (left), maximum inten￾sity projection (center) and histology of testis (right). FDG PET/CT
showed a focal FDG-avide lesion in the right scrotum (white arrow)
and both nodal, extranodal and bone marrow involvement in supra￾and infradiaphragmatic locations. Histological analysis of the right
testis revealed a large B-cell lymphoproliferation, diffusely growing
between the seminiferous tubules, compatible with an EBV-negative
monomorphic B-cell PTLD, type primary testicular DLBCL of germi- nal center B-cell origin. SUV: standardized uptake value.

sification, indolent lymphomas frequently lack FDG avidi￾ty.
19 However, their incidence might increase in the future
due to improved patient survival and given the higher age
of transplant recipients.
20 Secondly, PET scan is not the pre￾ferred examination in case of suspicion of central nervous
system localization. In this situation, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain and cytological examination of
cerebrospinal fluid should be performed. Finally, PET scan
might not be the ideal imaging modality to detect isolated
allograft localization in heart or kidney transplant recipients
due to its high physiological background uptake and renal
clearance. Besides excellent sensitivity, the high positive
predictive value indicates that FDG-PET has, at least in
experienced hands, an excellent ability to differentiate
PTLD from other FDG-avid conditions, mostly infectious or
inflammatory disorders.
Our data show intense FDG uptake in all visualized
lesions on PET scan, with a median mean SUV of 9.0 (range
2.0-18.6) and a median maximum SUV of 17.4 (range 2.6-
26.4). These values are more in favor of aggressive lym￾phomas, although no clear cut-off values have been report￾ed.
21-25 FDG uptake intensity was high in all WHO subtypes,
although the numbers of especially polymorphic and
Hodgkin-like PTLD were too small to draw conclusions
about intensity in these lesions. An additional confounding
factor in interpretation of SUV is the fact that patients may
have more than one histological subtype in different lesions
simultaneously.
In conclusion, our study shows a high accuracy when
using PET scan in the diagnosis and staging of PTLD fol￾lowing solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplan￾tation. Despite some methodological limitations, includ￾ing its retrospective nature and the lack of well-defined
and general accepted diagnostic scoring systems, our
analysis confirms the promising role of PET scan in diag￾nosis and staging of this rare but important disorder. An
additional advantage, though this has not been studied
yet, may be the use of PET scan to guide biopsy to the
most suspicious and easily accessible lesions and to mon￾itor therapy response.
