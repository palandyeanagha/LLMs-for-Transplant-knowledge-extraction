ABSTRACT
Despite the clinical complexity of patients with severe liver disease and the
technical demands associated with the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS), the major complication rate of this procedure is less than 5%. Delayed
recognition and treatment of complications related to TIPS can have life-threatening
consequences. This article provides an overview of the spectrum of periprocedural and
delayed complications related to the performance of TIPS and offers the reader pearls for
both avoiding and managing those complications.

The creation of a transjugular intrahepatic por￾tosystemic shunt (TIPS) is one of the most challenging
procedures performed by interventional radiologists.
With increased experience, the technical success rate of
the procedure should be greater than 95% with a major
complication rate of less than 5%.1,2 This article will
focus on the most common complications related to the
TIPS procedure and some practical solutions to avoid or
solve these complications.
PATIENT’S INDIVIDUAL RISK FOR
COMPLICATIONS
Earlier studies have evaluated independent predictors of
30-day mortality after TIPS placement in attempts to
identify patients at risk. Several risk factors have been
identified including sex, age, preexisting encephalopathy,
elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, high creati￾nine, low albumin levels, presence of ascites, and emer￾gent versus elective TIPS procedure.3–7 It has also been

well described that patients undergoing an emergency
TIPS have a higher postprocedural mortality when com￾pared with patients undergoing elective TIPS.8,9 The
utility of clinical and biochemical scoring systems such as
the Child-Pugh score, the prognostic index (PI) score,
and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evalua￾tion (APACHE) II score have also been evaluated.6,10 In
general, it has been described that patients undergoing
emergent TIPS and have a Child-Pugh score > 12, a PI
score > 18.52, or an APACHE II score> 18 have a poor
prognosis.6,10,11 Recently, the model of end-stage liver
disease (MELD) score was developed to predict the
3-month mortality of patients undergoing elective
TIPS.12 In this scoring system, the serum bilirubin levels,
serum creatinine levels, and international normalized
ratio are plotted in a formula and a score is calculated.13
A MELD score greater than 18 has been described to
be associated with a poor prognosis.14–16 The first step
to a successful TIPS is careful patient selection.
PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS
Vascular Access
CAROTID ARTERY INJURIES
Puncture of the carotid artery may occur while attempt￾ing an internal jugular vein approach for the TIPS
procedure, especially if the landmark technique to access
the jugular vein is employed. Venous access should be
obtained using real-time sonographic guidance. This
maneuver is very safe and expedites the venous access
step of the procedure.
RIGHT ATRIAL PERFORATION
Perforation of the right atrium caused by the 10-F access
sheath has been described.17 This complication has
occurred after the TIPS procedure in patients in whom
the sheath was left in place for intravenous fluids,
medications, or a 24-hour post-TIPS follow-up.17 The
long, rigid sheath may perforate the wall of the right
atrium, with the risk exacerbated by trauma to the atrial
wall resulting from the heart’s pulsations. To avoid this
problem, the long 10-F sheath must be exchanged for a
short 10-F sheath if the access must be preserved for
further medical management.
Complications during Portal Vein Localization
BLEEDING AFTER PERCUTANEOUS PORTOGRAPHY
The key step during the TIPS procedure is obtaining a
safe access into the portal vein. Many authors have
emphasized the importance of portal vein localization
before attempting the transhepatic puncture.18–21 If the
precise position of the portal vein is known, the operator
has a target to aim toward and in theory, the number of
transhepatic punctures can be reduced. When the TIPS
procedure was in its early stages of development, one of
the first maneuvers described for localization of the
portal vein was the percutaneous placement of a retrieval
basket into the main portal vein.22 The retrieval basket
was used as a target for the transhepatic punctures.18
Investigators soon found that there was a high incidence
of bleeding through the transhepatic tract with a high
potential for a fatal outcome, and this technique was
rapidly abandoned.22
CAPSULAR LACERATION DURING WEDGED HEPATIC
VENOGRAM
In current practice, the wedged hepatic venogram is
probably the most commonly employed method for
portal vein localization during a TIPS procedure.20
An angiographic catheter or a balloon-occlusion cath￾eter is placed in a wedged position in one of the hepatic
veins. Next, either iodinated contrast or CO2 is injected
through the catheter to obtain retrograde opacification
of the portal vein. With this technique, successful
opacification of the portal vein is achieved in over
90% of cases.20 Liver laceration with capsular perfora￾tion can occur during a wedged hepatic venogram23
(Fig. 1) and is probably related to either forceful
injection of the iodinated contrast or explosive delivery
of CO2. This complication may have a fatal outcome23
;
however, in our experience, three patients have survived
this event. We think that the most appropriate action
when this complication is identified is to stay calm and
try to create the shunt as soon and safely as possible.
This complication is best avoided by performing a

careful wedged hepatic venogram using CO2 delivery
through a closed-bag system. We recommend gentle
pressure during CO2 injection at a rate of 15 mL/s 
2 seconds. Excellent images of the portal vein can be
obtained with this technique.
Complications during Portal Vein Access
PORTAL VEIN PERFORATION
Obtaining access into the portal vein is the most
challenging step during the TIPS procedure. Several
techniques have been described to facilitate portal vein
puncture and make it safer, including real-time ultra￾sonographic guidance,21 placement of a guide wire in
the portal vein, and recently, using a sectorial intra￾vascular ultrasound to perform the puncture.24 A punc￾ture directly into the main portal vein with subsequent
portal vein perforation may result in massive bleeding.
The main portal vein is extrahepatic in 47% of
patients and thus a direct puncture into the main portal
vein may result in massive extravasation when angio￾plasty of the tract is performed.19,20 This is probably the
most feared complication during TIPS. Fortunately,
this is an uncommon complication, reported to occur in
0.5% of cases,25 but if it occurs, it may result in a fatal
outcome.26,27 The first sign of portal vein perforation is
a sudden increase in the patient’s heart rate. Angio￾graphically, the portogram demonstrates massive ex￾travasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity
(Fig. 2A). If this complication is encountered, the
operator should act rapidly and effectively. The first
step is to stabilize the patient by rapidly placing an
angioplasty balloon (usually a 10-mm balloon) and
inflating it at the perforation site26 (Fig. 2B). The
next step is the deployment of a stent, making sure
that the perforation site is covered. In some cases,
the extravasation is sealed after placement of a bare
stent20,27; however, with the current availability of stent
grafts, we would recommend primary placement of a
stent graft as this maneuver will solve the problem in
most cases (Figs. 3A and 3B and Figs. 4A and 4B).28
The key to preventing this complication is to have
a clear understanding of the vascular anatomy of the
liver.19,20,29 The best way to avoid this complication is to
attempt entry into the right portal vein 3 cm lateral to
the portal bifurcation.30 This segment of the portal vein
is intrahepatic over 95% of the time, thereby minimizing
the risk of this complication.19,20,29
LACERATION OF THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA DURING
TRANSCAVAL PUNCTURE
When the hepatic veins cannot be used to create a TIPS,
alternative methods can be employed including direct
puncture through a hepatic vein stump such as in Budd￾Chiari patients31 (Figs. 5A to 5C), direct puncture from
the inferior vena cava to portal vein,32 methods such as
the ‘‘gun-sight’’ approach,33 or even the use of mesen￾teric vein access assisted with a minilaparotomy followed
by retrograde puncture from portal vein to hepatic veins
or inferior vena cava, as described by Rozenblit and
colleagues.34 These approaches increase the risk of

extravasation. This maneuver will control the bleeding most of the time. The next step would be the placement of a stent graft. Note the

vena cava laceration or injury and should be performed
with extreme caution and careful preprocedural plan￾ning, always keeping in mind the anatomic relationship
between the inferior vena cava, portal vein, and arterial
structures and ‘‘free’’ zones of the liver.19
HEPATIC ARTERY INJURY
Injuries to the hepatic artery during a TIPS procedure
are reported to occur in less than 1% of all TIPS cases.25
Severe hepatic artery injuries may have a fatal out￾come.35 It is very important that the operator is aware
of the catheter position at all times during a TIPS
procedure to identify this complication in a timely
fashion to prevent a major mistake with a fatal con￾sequence. First of all, we must be aware that it is not
uncommon to puncture the hepatic artery during a
TIPS procedure. This is usually an insignificant event
during the procedure and usually the operator may
ignore it, continue on, and complete the TIPS.20
Significant problems may occur when a catheter is fully
advanced into the hepatic artery (Figs. 6A to 6C)35 and
may be much worse if a communication is inadvertently
created between the hepatic artery and an hepatic
vein.36 If the hepatic artery is entered with a catheter

Direct portogram after placement of a 10 mm  7 cm VIATORR stent-graft (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) demonstrates a patent TIPS and
no further extravasation is observed.

vein is identified. Note the central puncture site within the main portal vein. (B) Portogram after Wallstent placement still demonstrates
the site of extravasation. In this case, placement of a bare stent did not control the portal vein leak and the patient required surgical repair
of the portal perforation.

or the large TIPS sheath, the recommended maneuver
is to slowly withdraw the catheter/sheath combination
until the hepatic artery is disengaged and then proceed
with tract embolization.37 It is important not to emb￾olize the hepatic artery as this maneuver may cause a
large liver infarction (Fig. 7) as the patient is already at
risk of developing ischemic liver failure after TIPS.35
Hepatic artery injury may also result in pseudoaneur￾ysm formation, hepatobiliary fistula with consequent
hemobilia, or hepatic infarction.
BILIARY DUCT INJURY
Puncture and opacification of the biliary ducts is com￾mon during a TIPS procedure (Fig. 8), but severe bile
duct injury is uncommon and reported to be present in
less than 1% of cases.25 A large communication between
the shunt tract and the biliary system can be associated
with fever, sepsis, and shunt stenosis or occlusion.38–40 A
fistulous communication with the biliary system must be
suspected in cases of subacute TIPS occlusion or in cases
with midshunt stenosis that do not respond well to

repeat angioplasty, requiring frequent revisions. It is
relatively difficult to demonstrate a TIPS to biliary
fistula, angiographically; however, if the complication
is demonstrated, the best approach is to manage the
problem with the placement of a stent graft41,42
(Figs. 9A to 9C). The incidence of this complication
may decrease significantly now that TIPS are more often
created using stent grafts.43 In some cases a biloma may
form as a consequence of bile duct injury during TIPS.
This may be managed with either percutaneous drainage

of the fluid cavity or endoscopic placement of a biliary
stent to drain the biliary system.
Complications during Stent Placement
STENT MISPLACEMENT
Early shunt dysfunction is usually related to an under￾lying technical problem, such as incomplete stent cov￾erage of the parenchymal tract or the presence of a kink
along the shunt tract.44,45 Incomplete stent coverage of
the transhepatic tract may be related to stent misplace￾ment, stent migration, or stent recoil. Ideally, the stent
should have a smooth curve with the portal vein end
placed 2 to 4 cm into the portal vein20 and the hepatic
vein end extending to the hepatocaval junction,46 being
careful not to extend the stent into the right atrium.
Until recently, the most common stent used for TIPS
creation has been the Wallstent (Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA). An advantage with the use of the Wall￾stent is that the operator has the ability to recapture and
reposition it if the initial deployment is inadequate,
reducing the risk of misplacement. If stent misplace￾ment occurs such as excessive protrusion of the stent
into the portal vein or insufficient stent covering of the
transhepatic tract, the key issue is to avoid losing wire
access and to place a second stent in tandem to cover the
entire tract. Misplacement with stent protrusion into
the right atrium may cause atrial perforation and
development of an aortoatrial fistula with devastating
consequences.
47 Probably the best maneuver here is
prevention, insisting on very careful stent deployment
technique during TIPS. If for any reason the stent ends
up protruding into the right atrium, it may be necessary
to remove the stent with a loop snare before perforation
occurs.48
Early shunt thrombosis caused by stent misplace￾ment resulting in a short or insufficiently stented tract
needs to be addressed with an expedited shunt revi￾sion.49,50 Stent revision usually requires removal of
thrombus with either a mechanical thrombectomy device
or pulse-spray thrombolysis. Once the thrombus is
removed, the revision is usually completed with place￾ment of an additional stent.49
STENT RECOIL
A disadvantage of the use of the Wallstent for TIPS is
that the stent has a tendency to recoil. Stent recoil may
make the length of the stent insufficient to maintain
shunt patency (Fig. 10). This phenomenon tends to occur
more often at the hepatic vein end of the shunt and is very
uncommon at the portal vein end of the shunt. When this
complication occurs, shunt revision is necessary. Revision
requires shunt catheterization, thrombectomy of the
occluded stent, and usually, additional stent placement.
If access into the shunt cannot be obtained, an option is
the creation of a new parallel shunt.49,50
STENT MIGRATION
Stent migration is a problematic situation. If the stent
migrates forward into the portal vein, it is very important
not to lose wire access and to attempt placing a second
stent in tandem to cover the entire tract with stent
material. The real problem comes when the stent mi￾grates centrally. If a guide wire is kept through the stent
at all times, the problem is relatively minor, the stent will

ascites.

migrate centrally into the right atrium, and it may be
retrieved with a loop snare with relative ease.50,51 How￾ever, if for any reason the wire is not kept through the
stent at all times, there is a possibility of stent migration
into the right ventricle and even into the pulmonary
artery, and this is really a distressing complication that
needs to be solved immediately as severe hemodynamic
complications or perforation of the cardiac chambers
may occur.52,53 Several authors have described techni￾ques for Wallstent retrieval during TIPS procedures.
The use of snares and large-bore access sheaths is key to
the success of migrated stent retrieval.51,54–56
Stent migration can also occur if an angioplasty
balloon is accidentally caught within the struts of the

stent.57 The most dangerous aspect of this complication
is that the stent may be dragged back into the right
atrium, causing perforation of the right atrium and
fistulization to the aorta. This complication may have a
fatal outcome.57 The best way to prevent this complica￾tion is to make sure that the angioplasty balloon used to
dilate a recently placed stent is completely deflated
before removal. Continuous extranegative pressure can
be applied with a 20- or 30-mL syringe if the operator
considers that the angioplasty balloon may have large
wings.
Complications after a Successful TIPS
HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES AFTER TIPS
The creation of TIPS causes diversion of the portal flow
with preferential flow through the shunt, redirecting
blood from the portal circulation to the systemic circu￾lation, and thereby exacerbating the hyperdynamic cir￾culatory state of the cirrhotic.58 Changes that occur after
a successful TIPS include significant elevation of the
pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure, cardiac
index, and pulmonary vascular resistance.58,59 These
changes may lead to an acute decompensation post￾TIPS in patients with limited cardiac reserve. If this
complication occurs, the management is medical with
diuretics, high-pressure O2 via a nonrebreather mask,
and sedation with morphine at a dose of 4 to 6 mg
intravenously. The best way to prevent this complication
is to perform a careful patient evaluation before TIPS. If
there is a clinical suspicion of right heart failure, a full
workup with echocardiography and indirect pressure
measurements may be necessary. If right ventricular
failure is diagnosed, the patient should not undergo a
TIPS procedure.60

retraction into the liver parenchyma with insufficient extension
into the portal vein. The shunt was occluded and required a TIPS
revision with extension of the stent further out into the portal vein.

shunt. The portogram shows successful shunt reduction after reducing stent placement.

LIVER FAILURE AFTER TIPS
The total portal flow diversion caused by a functioning
shunt may also result in fulminant liver failure after
TIPS.61,62 Most of the flow to the liver is supplied by
the portal vein and 20 to 25% is supplied by the hepatic
artery. The hepatic artery buffer response is the physio￾logical response of the hepatic artery to a sudden decrease
in portal flow.63 In a normal hepatic artery buffer re￾sponse, the flow in the hepatic artery increases enough to
compensate for the loss of portal flow.63 If the response is
insufficient, the patient may develop fulminant liver fail￾ure post-TIPS.61 Patients who develop liver failure after
TIPS usually present with a significant sudden elevation
of the total bilirubin along with a moderate elevation of
liver enzymes. If this phenomenon progresses rapidly
within the next few days, the outcome may be fatal. In
some cases, the derangement in liver function reaches a
peak and then slowly drifts down. If severe, this compli￾cation may be treated by placing a reducing stent in an
effort to decrease the flow through the shunt, and thus,
diminish the total portal flow diversion (Figs. 11A
and 11B). If placement of a reducing stent is not
successful in decreasing the flow through the shunt, it
may be necessary to occlude the shunt completely.
ENCEPHALOPATHY
The development of encephalopathy after TIPS is prob￾ably the most frequent complication related to the
procedure, its incidence ranging between 5 and 35%.64
Most of the time, encephalopathy can be managed
medically with a protein-restricted diet, branched-chain
amino acids, and the administration of oral lactulose.64
This approach controls 95% of cases of encephalopathy;
however, 3 to 7% of these patients show encephalopathy
that is refractory to therapy and a more aggressive
approach is required.64,65 The options include shunt
occlusion,66,67 creation of a reducing stent with a bare
stent,68,69 and the creation of a reducing stent using a
stent graft.70
Intentional permanent TIPS occlusion with coils
or other permanent occluding material has been associ￾ated with immediate severe hemodynamic changes such
as elevation of portal vein pressure and decrease in cardiac
output resulting in hypotension. These hemodynamic
changes may result in a fatal outcome and for this reason,
this maneuver is preferably avoided.66 Temporary shunt
occlusion67 has the advantage of enabling the operator to
recanalize the shunt if required. It appears that the
placement of a reducing stent is a much more reasonable
approach. Forauer and McLean created a reducing stent
by deploying a 10  42 mm Wallstent within a P-154
Palmaz stent ( Johnson & Johnson, Warren, NJ). The
constraining stent is then loaded into a 10-F sheath and it
is advanced to its final position by using a pusher from a
Vena-Tech inferior vena cava filter system (Braun, Evan￾ston, IL). The creation of a reducing stent by using a stent
graft was described by Madoff et al and is probably a
better option because the regulation of blood flow
through the stent graft is slightly more predictable than
the regulation of blood flow achieved by the use of a
reducing stent created with bare stents.64 These authors
deploy the Wallgraft on the back table. A dilator is then
used as a template to predetermine the diameter of the
reducing stent. A purse-string suture is then woven
through the mesh and graft material to create the ‘‘waist’’
in the reducing stent. The trailing two thirds of the graft
material are removed to prevent hepatic vein occlusion.
The stent graft is then loaded on a new 9-F sheath and
deployed within the existing patent shunt. With this
technique, Madoff and colleagues reported a 100% tech￾nical success and clinical benefit in four out of five
patients.64
RADIATION INJURIES
Radiation injuries are uncommon but may occur after a
lengthy TIPS.71 The technical difficulties associated
with this procedure have been overcome by most oper￾ators and now, a standard TIPS takes only 2 hours
with a total of 20 to 35 minutes of total fluoroscopy time
employed. Probably the best way to avoid radiation
injuries is to follow the basic rules to decrease excessive
radiation exposure (i.e., avoiding unnecessary fluoro￾scopy, not using largely magnified fields for long periods
of time, trying to avoid continuous fluoroscopy over the
same region, and restricting the area exposed to radiation
by using field collimation).
CONCLUSION
The TIPS procedure is considered safe. Major compli￾cations may occur but they are uncommon, presenting in
3 to 5% of patients undergoing the procedure. Oper￾ators performing TIPS should be aware of all the
potential major complications during this technically
difficult interventional procedure.
