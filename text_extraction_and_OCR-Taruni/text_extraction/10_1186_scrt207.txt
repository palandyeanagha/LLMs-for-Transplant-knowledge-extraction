Abstract
Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential for treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy;
however, the repair capability of MSCs declines with age and disease. MSCs from diabetic animals exhibit impaired
survival, proliferation, and differentiation and therefore require a strategy to improve their function. The aim of the
study was to develop a preconditioning strategy to augment the ability of MSCs from diabetes patients to repair
the diabetic heart.
Methods: Diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 mice (6 to 8 weeks) with streptozotocin injections (55 mg/kg) for 5
consecutive days. MSCs isolated from diabetic animals were preconditioned with medium from cardiomyocytes
exposed to oxidative stress and high glucose (HG/H-CCM).
Results: Gene expression of VEGF, ANG-1, GATA-4, NKx2.5 MEF2c, PCNA, and eNOS was upregulated after
preconditioning with HG/H-CCM, as evidenced by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Concurrently, increased AKT phosphorylation, proliferation, angiogenic ability, and reduced levels of apoptosis
were observed in HG/H-CCM-preconditioned diabetic MSCs compared with nontreated controls. HG/H-CCM￾preconditioned diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs (dmMSCs) were transplanted in diabetic animals and demonstrated
increased homing concomitant with augmented heart function. Gene expression of angiogenic and cardiac
markers was significantly upregulated in conjunction with paracrine factors (IGF-1, HGF, SDF-1, FGF-2) and, in
addition, reduced fibrosis, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis was observed in diabetic hearts 4 weeks after
transplantation of preconditioned dmMSCs compared with hearts with nontreated diabetic MSCs.
Conclusions: Preconditioning with HG/H-CCM enhances survival, proliferation, and the angiogenic ability of
dmMSCs, augmenting their ability to improve function in a diabetic heart.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus increases the incidence of heart failure
and mortality in diabetes patients [1]. Diabetic cardio￾myopathy is associated with diastolic and systolic im￾pairments, leading to endothelial dysfunction, alterations
in glucose metabolism, increased fatty acid oxidation,
and generation of free radicals [2-4]. Endothelial dys￾function significantly alters angiogenesis in a diabetic
heart because of impaired nitric oxide production [5]
that further contributes to the etiology of the disease.
Restoration of neoangiogenesis within a diabetic heart
remains a desirable treatment modality and may aug￾ment the depleted diabetic heart function.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit multilineage
differentiation potential [6-8] and have been widely used
in cell-based therapies for the alleviation of a number of
impairments, including cardiovascular disorders [9,10].
Even though MSCs represent a feasible choice for myo￾cardial repair, recent evidence implies that the capability
of MSCs to repair damaged tissues declines with age and

disease [11-14]. A number of preconditioning strategies
have been used to enhance depleted stem cell function
by treatment with growth factors, hypoxic shock, and
antiaging compounds [15,16]. Interestingly, hypoxic pre￾conditioning has been shown to increase mobilization,
adhesion, survival, and cardiomyogenic differentiation of
MSCs [17-19]. In addition, the age-depleted angiogenic
ability of MSCs can be enhanced by hypoxic precon￾ditioning, leading to improved therapeutic efficiency of
aged MSCs [20].
Onset of diabetes leads to premature aging of stem
cells [21] and is associated with impaired proliferation,
paracrine ability, and myogenic differentiation of bone
marrow-derived MSCs [22]. Diabetic MSCs demonstrate
low differentiation ability in culture conditions, yet pre￾conditioning strategies have not been exploited to improve
their function and thus represent an area of further
research. In the present study, we demonstrated that
diabetic-mouse MSCs (dmMSCs) cultured under high
glucose and oxidative stress have increased survival, pro￾liferation, and angiogenic ability. Furthermore, adoptive
transfer of preconditioned dmMSCs leads to significant
improvement in diabetic heart function.
Materials and methods
Animals
The animals used in this study were treated as per Ins￾tructions of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85–23, revised 1985), and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Committee at the
National Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology,
Lahore, Pakistan.
Cell culture
MSCs were isolated and cultured as described [23]. In
brief, 60 days after diabetes induction, animals were
anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal pentobarbital
(40 mg/kg) injection. MSCs from tibias and femurs of
C57BL/6 mice were isolated and cultured in Iscove Mo￾dified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM) supplemented with
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and
streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Sprague–Dawley rat pups
(n = 10) were anesthetized on ice followed by whole￾heart removal for cardiomyocyte isolation by using a
cardiomyocytes isolation system (Worthington Biomedical
Corporation, NJ USA), as described previously [14].
Oxidative stress
Cardiomyocytes were divided into four experimental
treatment groups: (I) low glucose (LG; glucose, 5 mM);
(II) low glucose H2O2 (LG/H); (III) high glucose (HG;
glucose, 25 mM); and (IV) high glucose H2O2 (HG/H).
Oxidative stress was induced with H2O2 (100 μM) for 60
and 90 minutes in serum-free medium. Cardiomyocytes
kept in glucose and serum-free medium were used as
the control.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
VEGF concentration was determined by using VEGF
ELISA kit (Invitrogen, CA USA), according to the manu￾facturer’s protocol. Medium from cardiomyocyte cul￾tures after no treatment and oxidative stress was
collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
Preconditioning of diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs
Preconditioning of diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs
(dmMSCs) was done by using two strategies. In the
first strategy, dmMSCs were preconditioned with car￾diomyogenic medium (CCM) comprising the four
treatments described that is, (I) LG, (II) LG/ H, (III)
HG, and (IV) HG/H.
In the second strategy, we used VEGF pretreatment in
concentrations corresponding to ELISA readouts in four
CCM treatment groups with the aim to differentiate the
effect of cardiomyogenic medium from the solitary effect
of VEGF on dmMSCs function. VEGF concentrations
in the four groups were as follows: (I) 0.1 ng/ml, (II)
0.05 ng/ml (II), (III) 0.065 ng/ml, and (IV) 0.145 ng/ml.
Preconditioning was done for 48 hours, and nontreated
dmMSCs were used as controls.
Gene-expression profiling
RNA was extracted from normal MSCs, nontreated
dmMSCs, preconditioned dmMSCs, and heart tissue sam￾ples by using Trizole reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and quan￾tified with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, DE USA). cDNA synthesis was performed
from 1 μg RNA by using a reverse transcriptase kit
(Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out by using
SYBR Green PCR Super Mix (BioRad, CA USA), 8
mM of each primer, and 100 to 500 ng/ml of tem￾plate cDNA on BioRad System iQ5. The relative ratio
and standard deviation between the normal and
treated samples were calculated by using the com￾parative Ct method (DD Ct value), as recommended
by the BioRad iQ5system. RT-PCR analysis was carried
out for IGF-1, p16INK4a, p66shc, p53, VEGF, ANG-1, NF￾κB, MEF2c, GATA-4, NKx2.5, CD31, CD34, PCNA,
eNOS, and iNOS on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700
(Applied Biosystems, CA USA). GAPDH was used as an
internal control, and bands were quantified by using
ImageJ. The sequences (5′ to 3′) for the primer pairs and
their product lengths (bp) are mentioned in Table 1.

Analysis of preconditioned diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs
Two groups of preconditioned dmMSCs were selected
for further analysis on the basis of RT-PCR results (that
is, HG/H-CCM and the VEGF (0.065 ng/ml) groups.
Cell viability
Viability of dmMSCs after preconditioning was done
with the trypan blue exclusion method. The precon￾ditioned (CCM and VEGF preconditioned) diabetic cells
and diabetic nontreated cells were trypsinized, centri￾fuged, and counted by using a hemocytometer.
Lactate dehydrogenase assay
LDH assay was used to determine the extent of cell
damage in both preconditioned groups by using the
LDH assay kit (Sigma T0X-7, MO USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance values were
measured by using Spectra max PLUS 384 (Molecular
Devices, CA USA) at 490 nm.
Apoptosis
Apoptosis was measured in nontreated and precondi￾tioned dmMSCs by using the Phycoerythrin Annexin-V
kit (Abcam, CA USA). In brief, 6 × 104 diabetic MSCs
were plated in a 24-well plate (Corning, MA USA) and
treated with HG/H-CCM and VEGF (0.065 ng/ml)
groups followed by H2O2 (100 μM) treatment for 90 mi￾nutes to induce apoptosis. The Annexin-V+ cells were
then counted at random in five fields per triplicate
well for each treatment.
Immunoblot
Total protein was extracted from both preconditioned
groups and nontreated dmMSCs by using RIPA buffer and
estimated with Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, CA USA)
followed by separation on 10% SDS-PAGE. The membrane
was then incubated overnight at 4°C with AKT (Santa
Cruz, CA USA), phospo-AKT serine 473 (Abcam), and β￾actin (Abcam, CA USA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit sec￾ondary antibodies (Abcam) HRP-conjugated were applied
for 1 hour, and bands were visualized with an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, PE USA).
Cell proliferation
A cell-proliferation assay was carried out with a XTT
(sodium 3–[1- {phenylaminocarbonyl}-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis
{4-methoxy-6-nitro} benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) cell
proliferation kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Roche, IN USA). In brief, 4 × 103 dmMSCs were plated in
triplicate in a 96-well plate (Corning, USA) overnight in
IMDM supplemented with 20% FBS in an incubator at
37°C and 5% CO2. Absorbance was taken at 450 nm by
using Spectra max PLUS 384 (Molecular Devices), with
650 nm as the reference wavelength.
In vitro tube-forming assay
In vitro angiogenic potential of both preconditioned
groups and nontreated dmMSCs was assessed with a gela￾tinous protein mixture (Matrigel) assay (BD Bioscience,
CA USA), as described previously [23]. In brief, 8 × 103
cells from each treatment group were plated on Matrigel￾coated wells and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. The forma￾tion of tubular network was examined after 48 hours. The
images were taken in a phase-contrast microscope (IX-51,

Olympus, Tokyo Japan) equipped with a digital camera,
DP-71 (Olympus).
Nitric oxide activity
NOS activity was determined with an NOS colorimetric
assay kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, NB 78, Upper
Heyford, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, protein was isolated by using lysis buffer from
both preconditioned groups and nontreated dmMSCs to
measure NOS activity. Absorbance values were measured
by using Spectra max PLUS 384 (Molecular Devices) at
540 nm.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy model for cell transplantation
Diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by strep￾tozotocin administration, as described previously [23]. In
brief, diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type mice
(6 to 8 weeks old) by intraperitoneal injection of strep￾tozotocin (55 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. Because
streptozotocin metabolizes within 24 hours, mice were
housed with absorbent bedding and food and water ad
libitum. At day 16 after the initial injection, mice were
weighed, and their blood glucose level was measured.
Only streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice with blood
glucose levels >300 mg/dl were included in the study.
Mice after 2 months of diabetes induction were divided
into four groups (n = 6). Mice in group I served as nor￾mal control; group II, as diabetic control injected with
saline; group III, as diabetic animals transplanted with
nontreated dmMSCs; and group IV, as diabetic animals
transplanted with preconditioned dmMSCs. In brief,
mice were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal in￾jection of pentobarbital, and the adequacy of anesthesia
was monitored by animal-reflex responses to stimuli.
The heart was exposed by left-side limited thoracotomy,
and cells were transplanted into the left ventricle. Mice
were given subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) in￾jections before the procedure and 24 hours after surgery.
Cell concentration used was 1 × 106
/ml, and animals
were given intramyocardial injections of MSCs (10 μl ~
100,000 cells/animal) at two distinct sites in the left
ventricle.
Assessment of heart function
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40
mg/kg), and hemodynamic function was assessed by
using the Millar apparatus (Millar Instruments, Inc.,
Houston, TX, USA), as described previously [24]. Left
ventricle (LV) systolic function was evaluated with Pmax,
dp/dtmax, and arterial elastance. LV diastolic function
was evaluated with end-diastolic pressure and dp/dtmin.
Analysis was carried out by using the Millar PVAN soft￾ware (version 3.3).
Fibrosis
Histologic analysis was performed to determine colla￾gen deposition in the diabetic heart. Heart sections were
stained with Masson trichrome stain, and 10 random
fields were selected and photographed with light micros￾copy at 200× magnification. The extent of fibrosis in the
respective images was quantified by using Image J ana￾lysis software.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized and killed by cervical dislocation
4 weeks after MSC injections. The hearts were removed,
and sections were analyzed for the detection of cleaved
caspase-3 and eNOS through application of enzyme￾labeled polymer (Vector ImmPRESS kit; Vector Laborator￾ies, CA USA). The frozen tissue was cut into 5-μm
sections, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized
by using 0.2% Triton X-100. Sections were treated with 3%
H2O2 for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase
activity, followed by blocking in 5% donkey serum for 1
hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated over￾night with primary antibodies of polyclonal rabbit anti￾caspase-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a
rabbit polyclonal anti-eNOS antibody (Abcam) and treated
with enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
specific secondary antibodies. Sections were incubated with
chromogen substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydro￾chloride (DAB) solution and counterstained with the
Weigert Iron Hematoxylin solution to stain the nuclei.
Capillary density was measured by staining sections from
control and transplanted groups with α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO USA), and small arte￾rioles per five random fields of each section were counted.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Graph Pad
Prism-5 software and SPSS software. All data values are
expressed as mean ± SEM. The comparison between
more than two parameters was assessed with ANOVA
with the Bonferroni post hoc test. The comparison bet￾ween two groups was performed by using a Student t test.
P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Preconditioning of diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs
Diabetic-mouse-derived MSCs (dmMSCs) were isolated
from diabetic mice 60 days after induction of diabetes
and confirmed by blood glucose levels >300 mg/dl
(Figure 1A). Characterization of dmMSCs demons￾trated increased levels of p16INK4a, p66shc, and p53
concomitant with decreased expression of IGF-1, VEGF,
and Ang-1, compared with normal MSCs, as evidenced by
RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1B, C). The dmMSCs were
preconditioned with Conditioned Cardiomyogenic Medium

(CCM) to improve dmMSCs function. CCM was prepared
by induction of oxidative stress in neonatal rat car￾diomyocytes (NRCMs) in combination with low glu￾cose (5.5 mM) and high glucose (25 mM). Results
showed that VEGF release increased significantly after
90 minutes of H2O2 induced oxidative stress compared
with 60 minutes in NRCMs (Figure 1D). In contrast,
VEGF levels were not detected in nontreated cardiomy￾ocytes kept in glucose and serum-free medium (data not
shown). Because 90 minutes of oxidative stress resulted in
maximal VEGF release, it was selected as the optimal
treatment to be used in combination with high and low
glucose for subsequent experiments.
Alternatively, to determine whether VEGF alone can
be used as a comparable preconditioning strategy to
treatment with CCM, dmMSCs were preconditioned with
various concentrations of VEGF corresponding to VEGF
ELISA readout after exposure of NRCMs to various treat￾ments, as described earlier.
Gene-expression analysis of angiogenic and cardiac mar￾kers was done for all groups of CCM- and VEGF-treated
dmMSCs by RT-PCR, whereas nontreated dmMSCs were
used as controls. Elevated levels of VEGF, ANG-1 (angio￾genic markers), MEF2c, NKx2.5, and GATA-4 (cardiac
transcription factors) were observed in the HG/H-CCM
group (Figure 1E, F) compared with all other CCM treat￾ment groups. Among the VEGF treatment groups, 0.065
ng/ml VEGF concentration resulted in significantly higher
levels of the same angiogenic markers and cardiac tran￾scription factors mentioned earlier compared with other
VEGF concentrations and the diabetic nontreated group
(Figure 1G, H). Furthermore, a significant decline in

p53 expression was observed in dmMSCs treated with
HG/H-CCM compared with all other treatment groups
(Figure 1I). Determine the best preconditioning strategy,
dmMSCs were treated with HG/H-CCM or 0.065 ng/ml
VEGF and analyzed with RT-PCR for angiogenic and
cardiac-specific markers. Gene-expression analysis results
indicated a significant increase in VEGF, ANG-1, MEF2c,
NKx2.5, and GATA-4 after treatment with HG/H-CCM
compared with 0.065 ng/ml VEGF and the diabetic non￾treated group (Figure 1J to L).
CCM preconditioning promotes survival and proliferation
of dmMSCs
The effect of preconditioning on survival was analyzed
with immunoblot for AKT and phosphoAKT. In vitro ex￾periments showed that the HG/H-CCM preconditioned
group significantly increased AKT phosphorylation com￾pared with VEGF (0.065 ng/ml) or nontreated dmMSCs
(Figure 2A, B). Increased cell viability was observed
in HG/H-CCM (76% ± 5.54%) compared with VEGF
(45% ± 3.7%) and nontreated dmMSCs (28% ± 1.4%),
evidenced by the trypan-blue exclusion assay (Figure 2C).
Cellular damage evidenced by the LDH-release assay was
significantly reduced after HG/H-CCM (18% ± 3.5%)
treatment compared with VEGF (48% ± 2.3%) and
nontreated dmMSCs (66% ± 3.4%) (Figure 2D). Concur￾rently, a significantly low number of Annexin-V+ cells
was observed in HG/H-CCM (6% ± 1.88%) compared
with VEGF (9% ± 1.4%) and nontreated dmMSCs (20% ±
6.1%) (Figure 2G).
Gene expression of PCNA was observed to be signi￾ficantly increased after HG/H-CCM treatment versus
VEGF versus nontreated dmMSCs (Figure 2E, F). In ad￾dition, cell proliferation was assessed after treatment
with HG/H-CCM and VEGF (0.065 ng/ml). Precondi￾tioning with HG/H-CCM resulted in significantly higher
proliferation at 24 and 48 hours (2.61 ± 0.10; 3.1 ± 0.14)
followed by VEGF treatment (1.44 ± 0.84; 2.0 ± 0.96)
and nontreated dmMSCs (1.2 ± 0.11; 1.74 ± 0.12)
(Figure 2H).
Increased angiogenic ability of dmMSCs after CCM
preconditioning
The effect of HG/H-CCM or VEGF preconditioning on
the ability of dmMSCs for tube formation was assessed
by their culture on Matrigel. The in vitro tube-formation
ability of dmMSCs was significantly improved in the
HG/H-CCM-conditioned group compared with VEGF
(0.065 ng/ml) and nontreated dmMSCs (Figure 3A
through D). Significant upregulation of angiogenic

markers CD31 and CD34 was observed in the HG/H￾CCM group compared with VEGF and nontreated
dmMSCs, as evidenced by gene-expression analysis
(Figure 3E, F). Concurrently, dmMSCs showed signifi￾cantly augmented NOS activity after 48 hours of
preconditioning in HG/H-CCM (196 ± 2.0 μM) treatment
compared with VEGF (107 ± 8.8 μM) and nontreated
dmMSCs (57 ± 6.3 μM) (Figure 3G).
Increased homing and paracrine signaling
Increased survival of preconditioned dmMSCs was ob￾served in diabetic animals 4 weeks after transplantation
compared with nontreated MSCs, confirming the effect
of preconditioning on dmMSC homing ability (Figure 4A
to C). Analysis of paracrine factors demonstrated signifi￾cant upregulation of IGF-1, FGF-2, SDF-1, and HGF in
group IV animals transplanted with dmMSCs precondi￾tioned with HG/H-CCM compared with group III animals
transplanted with nontreated dmMSCs (Figure 4D). Fur￾thermore, gene-expression analysis demonstrated that
group IV animals, transplanted with dmMSCs precon￾ditioned with HG/H-CCM, exhibited significantly upre￾gulated expression of VEGF, ANG-1, MEF2c, NKx2.5,
GATA-4, and NF-κB, as evidenced by RT-PCR compared
with group III animals transplanted with nontreated
MSCs and diabetic control animals (Figure 4E, F).
CCM preconditioning improves cardiac function
Cardiac function of diabetic mice transplanted with
HG/H-CCM preconditioned or nontreated dmMSCs
was assessed after 4 weeks with the Millar apparatus

observed in the cardiac tissue of group IV mice
transplanted with HG/H-CCM-preconditioned MSCs,
whereas it was much weaker in the group III and II
mice. Quantification of eNOS+ cells confirmed signifi￾cantly more cells in diabetic hearts treated with HG/H￾CCM-preconditioned MSCs compared with all other

diabetic myocardium transplanted with HG/H-CCM￾preconditioned MSCs (Figure 7E through I).
Discussion
Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for development
of myocardial infarction in a large segment of the popu￾lation, causing an enormous economic burden. A num￾ber of studies have shown that diabetic hearts are more
sensitive to ischemic insults that can lead to heart failure
[25,26]. Development of diabetic cardiomyopathy is as￾sociated with decreased diastolic compliance, increased
interstitial fibrosis, and myocyte hypertrophy [25]. Ac￾crual of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a diabetic heart
leads to endothelium dysfunction characterized by
vascular remodeling, disappearance of capillary endothe￾lium, and altered gene and protein expression in endo￾thelial cells [27]. Cell-based therapies using MSCs have
been successfully used for treatment of the damaged
heart, yet stem cells isolated from diabetic animals have
severely reduced reparability [21], resulting in dimin￾ished heart repair after autologous transplantation [28].
Therefore, the present study demonstrated that precon￾ditioning with HG/H-CCM can augment survival, proli￾feration, and angiogenic ability of MSCs isolated from
streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
Bone marrow-derived MSCs have been shown to be
the best candidates for myocardial regeneration and pos￾sess the ability to form cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells,
and smooth muscle cells [29,30]. Adoptive transfer of
MSCs in a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy is asso￾ciated with enhanced angiogenesis, myogenesis, and car￾diac function [31,32]. Nevertheless, the success of MSCs
therapy for diabetic heart repair has been accompanied
by reports of functional MSC decline as a consequence
of diabetes. MSCs from streptozotocin-induced diabetic
rats have impaired abilities for proliferation, paracrine,
antiapoptosis, and myogenic differentiation [22]. Simi￾larly, the onset of diabetes can attenuate the osteogenic
differentiation ability of MSCs [33]. Therefore, augmen￾tation of depleted MSC function becomes imperative if
MSCs are to be used for autologous therapy to repair
diabetic heart failure.
Preconditioning of stem cells with growth factors [23],
hypoxic shock [34], and antiaging [35] compounds rep￾resents an effective strategy to enhance survival, proli￾feration, and differentiation of MSCs. Recent studies
showed that ischemic preconditioning is a powerful re￾gulator of cardioprotection [36-38], and we hypothesized
that short-term stimulation of cardiomyocytes with a
combination of stress stimuli can mimic in vitro the

effects of ischemic preconditioning observed in vivo.
Therefore, the normal and diabetic microenvironments
of the myocardium were simulated in vitro by treating
NRCMs with a combination of oxidative stress and high
glucose, with the premise that treatment of dmMSCs
with HG/H-CCM can enhance survival, proliferation, and
importantly, increase the angiogenic ability of dmMSCs.
We showed previously that diabetic mouse-derived MSCs
have impaired proliferation, antioxidant levels, and sur￾vival signaling [23], meriting the need for preconditioning.
Increased VEGF levels were observed in conditioned me￾dium from NRCMs treated with HG/H and concurs with
previous reports showing upregulation of VEGF as a con￾sequence of hypoxia [34]. In parallel to medium precondi￾tioning, dmMSCs were preconditioned with VEGF alone
to highlight that HG/H-CCM may contain other angio￾genic and nonangiogenic paracrine factors, and these fac￾tors collectively can produce the optimal cellular response
compared with treatment with VEGF alone.
dmMSCs were preconditioned with HG/H-CCM in
parallel with VEGF. HG/H-CCM preconditioning signifi￾cantly increased survival and proliferation of dmMSCs
compared with treatment with VEGF alone and non￾treated control. Our study also shows that the HG/H￾CCM preconditioning favors commitment of dmMSCs
to the endothelial lineage, as confirmed by RT-PCR ex￾pression of endothelial lineage markers CD31 and CD34,
concomitant with increased tube formation and nitric
oxide production. These results concur with previous
reports showing that oxidative stress can enhance re￾cruitment [39], survival [34,40], migration [16], and dif￾ferentiation [41] of MSCs. Furthermore, it has been
shown that oxidative stress can augment the angiogenic
potential of age-depleted bone marrow and adipose￾derived MSCs [42] and concurs with our observed re￾sults showing increased angiogenic ability of diabetic
MSCs after preconditioning with HG/H-CCM.
Adoptive transfer of HG/H-CCM-preconditioned
dmMSCs in diabetic animals showed augmented car￾diac function and was concomitant with reduced collagen
deposition and apoptosis, compared with nontreated
dmMSCs and diabetic controls. Interestingly, transplant￾ation of HG/H-CCM-preconditioned dmMSCs resulted in
significant augmentation of angiogenesis in the diabetic
heart, evidenced by increased SMA+ cells and eNOS
expression, whereas iNOS expression was significantly re￾duced compared with animals transplanted with non￾treated dmMSCs and diabetic controls. Gene-expression
analysis of hearts from animals transplanted with HG/
H-CCM-preconditioned dmMSCs showed increased an￾giogenic (VEGF, ANG-1) and cardiac (MEF2c, GATA-4,
NKx2.5) markers but decreased expression of NF-κB com￾pared with animals with nontreated dmMSCs and diabetic
controls. Conversely, increased paracrine factors (IGF-1,
FGF-2, SDF-1, HGF) were found in the hearts of animals
transplanted with CCM-preconditioned dmMSCs, sup￾porting the idea that preconditioned dmMSCs have better
survival, angiogenic ability, and can improve heart func￾tion by augmentation of a diabetic environment, possibly
through a paracrine-mediated effect.
MSCs represent an attractive option for cell-based the￾rapies for the repair of the diabetic heart. However, MSCs
from a diabetic animal have attenuated ability to survive,
proliferate, and repair the heart. Therefore, we showed
that preconditioning with HG/H-CCM can augment sur￾vival, proliferation, and the angiogenic ability of dmMSCs.
Furthermore, adoptive transfer of dmMSCs precondi￾tioned with HG/H-CCM improves cardiac function and
angiogenesis while reducing fibrosis and apoptosis in the
diabetic heart, possibly through a paracrine effect. Thus,
preconditioning of dmMSCs represents an effective stra￾tegy to improve depleted MSC function and holds pro￾mise for the treatment of diabetic heart failure.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that preconditioning with cardiomyo￾genic medium can improve survival, proliferation, and
cardiac-repair ability of dmMSCs. Development of dia￾betes mellitus has been shown to attenuate MSC sur￾vival, proliferation, and the ability to repair the heart
after myocardial infarction. Preconditioning strategies
consist of growth factors, hypoxia, and other factors and
can augment depleted stem-cell function to repair dam￾aged organs. We used a preconditioning strategy based
on medium from cardiomyocytes treated with oxidative
stress and high glucose, with the premise that acute
exposure to stress can stimulate cardiomyocytes to re￾lease paracrine factors in the medium. Preconditioning
of dmMSCs with medium rich in paracrine factors from
the cardiomyocytes increased survival, proliferation, and
angiogenic ability to dmMSCs. Therefore, we report here
a viable strategy to enhance dmMSC function and in￾crease repair of diabetic myocardium.
