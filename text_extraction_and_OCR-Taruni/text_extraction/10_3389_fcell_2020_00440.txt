Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a clinically and anatomically severe form of
congenital heart disease; however, its etiology remains largely unknown. We previously
demonstrated that genetic variants in the MYH6 gene are significantly associated with
HLHS. Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs)
from an HLHS-affected family trio (affected parent, unaffected parent, affected proband)
carrying an MYH6-R443P head domain variant demonstrated dysmorphic sarcomere
structure and increased compensatory MYH7 expression. Analysis of iPSC-CMs derived
from the HLHS trio revealed that only beta myosin heavy chain expression was observed
in CMs carrying the MYH6-R443P variant after differentiation day 15 (D15). Functional
assessments performed between D20-D23 revealed that MYH6-R443P variant CMs
contracted more slowly (40 ± 2 vs. 47 ± 2 contractions/min, P < 0.05), shortened less
(5.6 ± 0.5 vs. 8.1 ± 0.7% of cell length, P < 0.05), and exhibited slower shortening
rates (19.9 ± 1.7 vs. 28.1 ± 2.5 µm/s, P < 0.05) and relaxation rates (11.0 ± 0.9 vs.
19.7 ± 2.0 µm/s, P < 0.05). Treatment with isoproterenol had no effect on iPSC-CM
mechanics. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, introduction of the R443P
variant into the unaffected parent’s iPSCs recapitulated the phenotype of the proband’s
iPSC-CMs, and conversely, correction of the R443P variant in the proband’s iPSCs
rescued the cardiomyogenic differentiation, sarcomere organization, slower contraction
(P < 0.05) and decreased velocity phenotypes (P < 0.0001). This is the first report
to identify that cardiac tissues from HLHS patients with MYH6 variants can exhibit
sarcomere disorganization in atrial but not ventricular tissues. This new discovery
was not unexpected, since MYH6 is expressed predominantly in the postnatal atria
in humans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of employing patient-derived

Kim et al. iPSC-CMs With MYH6-R443P in HLHS
iPSC-CMs, in combination with patient cardiac tissues, to gain mechanistic insight
into how genetic variants can lead to HLHS. Results from this study suggest that
decreased contractility of CMs due to sarcomere disorganization in the atria may effect
hemodynamic changes preventing development of a normal left ventricle.

INTRODUCTION
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe form of
congenital heart disease (CHD) characterized by atresia/stenosis
of the aortic and mitral valves, and severe hypoplasia of the
left ventricle and aorta (Noonan and Nadas, 1958). HLHS
affects more than one in every 4000 live births (Mai et al.,
2019). Evidence supporting a genetic basis for HLHS includes
observations of familial clustering, high heritability, and its
occurrence with specific chromosomal disorders such as Turner
and Jacobsen syndromes (Tomita-Mitchell et al., 2016; Lara
et al., 2017; Yagi et al., 2018). HLHS exhibits complex genetic
inheritance along with an increased frequency of bicuspid aortic
valve (BAV) and coarctation of the aorta (CoA) in relatives of
HLHS patients (Hinton et al., 2007, 2009). Variants in genes such
as GJA1 (Dasgupta et al., 2001), NKX2.5 (Elliott et al., 2003),
NOTCH1 (Garg et al., 2005; McBride et al., 2008; Hrstka et al.,
2017; Yang et al., 2017), and MYH6 (Theis et al., 2015; Tomita￾Mitchell et al., 2016), as well as observations of syndromic or
rare copy number variants (CNVs) in cardiomyogenic genes
(Grossfeld, 2007; Grossfeld et al., 2009; Tomita-Mitchell et al.,
2012; Warburton et al., 2014; Glidewell et al., 2015) have
been associated with HLHS. We previously reported that rare
variants in MYH6 (alpha myosin heavy chain; α-MHC) were
observed in 10% of HLHS patients, and that cardiac transplant￾free survival was reduced in HLHS subjects containing MYH6
variants in comparison with HLHS patients without MYH6
variants. Furthermore, cardiac tissue from MYH6 variant carriers
exhibited significant upregulation of sarcomere genes, including
ACTA1 (actin alpha 1), MYL2 (myosin light chain 2), TNNT2
(cardiac troponin T), and the MYH6 homolog MYH7, which
encodes the beta-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) isoform. Using
cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) obtained from an HLHS patient carrying an MYH6-
R443P variant, we discovered that sarcomere structure was
dysmorphic (Tomita-Mitchell et al., 2016).
Two myosin heavy chain proteins (α-MHC and β-MHC)
are expressed in the human heart. During development,
α-MHC is expressed in both the primitive atrium and
ventricle until gestational day 35, after which its expression
continually decreases in the ventricle (Wessels et al., 1990,
1991). In contrast, β-MHC expression gradually increases
in the ventricles throughout gestation and this expression
pattern persists throughout adult stages, so that β-MHC is
the predominant ventricular isoform, while α-MHC is the
predominant atrial isoform in adults (Cummins and Lambert,
1986; Reiser et al., 2001). We previously noted that MYH6
mRNA strongly predominates during the earliest stages of
in vitro cardiomyogenesis in H1 human embryonic stem cells
wherein MYH6 comprises ∼99% of total MHC transcripts in
differentiation day 8 (D8) cultures, and declines to ∼86% at D14
(Kim et al., 2015). This likely reflects a prominent role for α-MHC
in nascent myocyte development that may be disrupted by MYH6
variants associated with HLHS.
Fetal heart development relies on proper blood flow, as
signaling pathways responsive to shear stress and pressure￾related strain both affect cardiac chamber formation. The
prevailing hypothesis is that HLHS pathophysiology stems from
impaired blood flow through the left ventricle (LV) during
cardiogenesis (Fishman et al., 1978; Gruber and Epstein, 2004;
deAlmeida et al., 2007). Our findings are consistent with this,
as disruptions in an atrial protein such as α-MHC would alter
ventricular preload with consequent defective expansion and/or
differentiation of cardiomyocytes resulting in a dysmorphic and
dysfunctional ventricle (Hove et al., 2003; Burggren et al., 2004;
Hierck et al., 2008; McCain and Parker, 2011; Santhanakrishnan
and Miller, 2011; Lee et al., 2016; McCormick and Tzima, 2016;
Hoog et al., 2018). This is further supported by studies of
weak atrium (wea) zebrafish, which harbor myh6 mutations and
exhibit defects in both cardiac chambers, including defective
atrial contraction along with abnormal sarcomere organization
and an underdeveloped ventricle (Berdougo et al., 2003).
Current non-invasive imaging methods allow detection of
HLHS as early as 16 weeks gestational age (Friedberg et al.,
2009; Galindo et al., 2009), long after the fetal heart is formed
and septated at 7–8 weeks. The primitive heart, expressing only
MYH6, begins beating even earlier, during the third week of
development. Thus, the pathological changes associated with
HLHS are likely present long before we are able to detect them.
Given these limitations, developmental defects such as HLHS are
often investigated using murine models. However, the chamber￾specific MHC expression in rodents is the opposite of humans,
making them an unsuitable option for our studies. Here we
studied human cardiac tissue and patient-specific iPSC-CMs
to identify structural characteristics of atrial and ventricular
tissue of HLHS patients and contractile properties of human
iPSC-CMs with an MYH6 variant. The latter permitted us to
monitor early stages of cardiomyogenesis in CMs of HLHS
patients in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the MYH6 variant
iPSC-CMs exhibit depressed extent and velocity of shortening
that can be rescued by correcting the variant in proband-iPSCs
using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing. Importantly, we show the feasibility
of employing iPSC-CMs to ascertain functional consequences
of the MYH6-R443P variant, demonstrating that changes in the
myosin isoforms confer contractile limitations.

Kim et al. iPSC-CMs With MYH6-R443P in HLHS
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants
Study subjects have been previously described (Tomita-Mitchell
et al., 2016). All subjects provided written informed consent,
and procedures were approved by the MCW Institutional
Review Board and conformed to the principles in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Gene Editing iPSC Lines
Guide RNA and ssODN Design
All CRISPRs were designed as previously described (Mitzelfelt
et al., 2017). Briefly, CRISPR target sites within 30 bps of
the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MYH6-R443P were
identified using ZiFiT Targeter (Version 4.2). Three guide
RNAs were cloned into pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9
(Addgene, Cambridge, MA, United States) to introduce MYH6-
R443P into the heart healthy parent’s iPSCs. CRISPR efficiency
was determined using the Cel-1 surveyor assay in HEK293 cells.
The variant MYH6-R443P was flanked approximately 60 bp on
either side by single strand oligonucleotides (ssODNs) (Table 1).
Silent mutations were incorporated to prevent re-cutting by Cas9
by disrupting the target sequence. An additional AAVS1 locus was
targeted for incorporation of GFP-puromycin resistance using
the AAVS1 Safe Harbor TALE-Nuclease kit (SBI, Palo Alto,
CA, United States).
To correct the MYH6-R443P variant in proband iPSCs, we
designed CRISPR targets (Table 1) to align with the variant allele
and purchased synthesized RNA (AltR CRISPR-Cas9 cr RNA,
Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, United States),
RFP-labeled repetitive sequence (AltR CRISPR-Cas9 tracr RNA,
Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, United States) and
purified Cas9 enzyme (40 Um/U1). Additionally, we designed
and validated a CRISPR targeting the AAVS1 locus to introduce

Transfecting iPSCs
Prior to transfection, iPSCs were pretreated for 3–4 h with 5 µM
Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y27632, Stemgent,
Lexington, MA, United States), dissociated with accutase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States)
to ensure single cell suspension, and transferred to an
electroporation cuvette. For each transfection (D0), 1 µg of
the gene-specific CRISPRs, 80 µM of the relevant ssODN, 1 µg
of each of the two AAVS1-specific cassettes, and 1 µg AAVS1
donor plasmid were added to 100 µl P4 solution (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) and electroporated using program CB-150 on
a 4D NucleofectorTM (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) into iPSCs
(1 × 106
cells/transfection). iPSCs from each transfection were
then seeded into one well of a geltrex-coated 24-well plate
(5 × 105
cells/cm2
) for recovery in mTeSR1 supplemented
with 5 µM ROCK inhibitor. The following day (D1), iPSCs
were cultured with mTeSR1. Two days post-transfection (D2),
iPSCs from one well of 24-well plate were sub-cultured at a
clonal density (∼5 × 104
cells/cm2
) into all wells of a 6-well
plate pre-seeded with mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic
fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, United States) in human ESC medium. ESC
medium was comprised of Knockout DMEM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) supplemented with
20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, United States), MEM-NEAA (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), 2 mM L-glutamine
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States),
Penicillin/Streptomycin, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), 10 ng/ml human basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
United States), 50 ng/ml L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, United States) and 5 µM ROCK inhibitor. Medium
was changed 2 days later (D4) to ESC medium without ROCK
inhibitor. Five days post-seeding (D5), medium was changed to
puromycin (0.5 g/ml)-supplemented MEF-conditioned medium
with bFGF and L-ascorbic acid, which was replaced every 2 days
for 1 week. Following maintenance (∼D12), distinct colonies
(∼1 mm diameter) were manually transferred to a single well
of a 24-well plate pre-coated with geltrex in mTeSR1 medium
plus ROCK inhibitor without MEFs. Following genotyping (see
below), clones were expanded to a geltrex-coated well of a 12-well
plate in mTeSR1 plus ROCK inhibitor and further expanded and
frozen in mFreSR freezing medium (STEMCELL Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada). Isolated CRISPRed iPSC lines were
frequently sub-cloned to ensure homogeneity of the population.
Allele-Specific SNP Genotyping and Sanger
Sequencing
To isolate genomic DNA from iPSCs, 30 µl Quick Extract
Solution (Epicentre, Madison, WI, United States) was added to
each cell pellet and incubated for 15 min at 65◦C, followed by
5 min at 95◦C. PCR was carried out using gene-specific primers

Kim et al. iPSC-CMs With MYH6-R443P in HLHS
(Table 1), and 2 µl of PCR product were used for further allele￾specific SNP genotyping with Quantstudio7 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). After confirmation of
gene edit, ∼100 ng of PCR product was treated with Exosap￾IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and
sent to Retrogen (San Diego, CA, United States) for Sanger
sequencing. Clones that were positive for iPSCs containing the
edited MYH6-R443P gene were sequenced at the conserved
region in MYH7 as well to check the CRISPR’s off-target activity.
Cardiomyocyte Differentiation of iPSCs
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated
from dermal fibroblasts donated by HLHS probands and their
parents. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed to pluripotent stem
cells using Sendai reprogramming as previously described
(Tomita-Mitchell et al., 2016). Pluripotency was confirmed with
morphological appearance and % of cells exhibiting Oct4-positive
immunostaining (99–100%). The cells were karyotypically
normal and had the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages
(definitive endoderm and cardiomyogenic mesoderm) (Tomita￾Mitchell et al., 2016). In short, iPSCs were maintained in a
hypoxic incubator at 5% CO2 and 4% O2. All experiments
were performed on cells during passages 10–50. One day
prior to inducing cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation, the
iPSCs were seeded at a cell density of >1 × 105
/cm2 on a
10 µg/cm2
geltrex-coated (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, United States) tissue culture dish. The cells were cultured
in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC,
Canada) supplemented with 5 µM ROCK inhibitor. The cells
were induced with 10 µM CHIR99021 (Stemgent, Lexington,
MA, United States) and 10 ng/ml Activin-A (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, United States) in insulin-free RPMI/B27
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). On
D3, the medium was exchanged for insulin-free RPMI/B27 with
5 µM IWP (Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom). Starting at D7,
at 2-day intervals the medium was changed to RPMI/B27 with
insulin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States).
Cultures were evaluated for % of cardiac troponin T (cTnT)
positive cells via flow cytometry and MHC (MF20) expression
by immunostaining. The cardiomyocytes were either frozen at
D15, or were sub-cultured between D10–D15 after dissociation
into single cells with 0.25% trypsin; specifically, cells centrifuged
at 1,000 rpm for 5 min were either frozen at a density of >2 × 106
in cryovials with 10% DMSO and 90% FBS, or were re-plated at
a density of 2 × 104–5 × 104
/cm2 on a geltrex-coated 12 cm2
round cover glass for single cell-based contractility studies, or at
>5 × 104
/ cm2
for automated contractility video analysis (Pulse
Video Analysis, Dana solutions, Palo Alto, CA, United States).
Cardiomyocyte
Sarcomere-Immunostaining
The iPSC-CMs and tissues were co-immunostained with
anti-sarcomeric α-actinin (AF594) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
United States) to image sarcomere organization, and anti-MHC
monoclonal MF20 (AF488) (DSHB, University of Iowa, Iowa
City, IA, United States) to inform myocyte identity. Sarcomeres
in iPSC-CMs were visualized with a Nikon inverted fluorescent
microscope at 400x.
Contractility of iPSC-CMs
All the contractile experiments with iPSC-CMs were conducted
in a non-biased blinded fashion. Contractile data were collected
from iPSC-CMs at differentiation days D20, D27, D34, and D41.
Experiments were conducted over 3 days such that D20 includes
D20-D23, D27 (D27–D30), D34 (D34–D37), and D41 (D41–
D43). The iPSC-CMs were transferred to a recording chamber
containing 1 mM Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution (35◦C) mounted on the
stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000). Spontaneously
contracting iPSCs were visualized at 40x and contractile events
recorded using a MyoCam-S video 250 Hz camera and a CFA300
cell framing adapter (IonOptix, Boston, MA, United States). The
left and right edges of iPSC-CMs were defined and contractions
per minute (CPM), shortening (µm), % cell shortening, and rates
of shortening and relaxation (µm/second) were measured using
the IonWizard image detection program (IonOptix, Boston, MA,
United States). Ten cells on a 12 cm2
round cover glass were
evaluated for 10 contractions each. For a subset of D20 iPSC￾CMs, the same parameters were determined for responses to 1
and 2 Hz stimulation or to 1 µM isoproterenol. As an alternative
method, an automated contractility software1
(Dana solution,
Palo Alto, CA, United States) (Maddah et al., 2014, 2015) was
used to study videos of contracting iPSC-CMs.
Action Potentials of iPSC-CMs
Action potentials of iPSC-CMs were obtained with
microelectrodes (50–70 M) filled with 2.7 M KCl and
10 mM HEPES and recorded at 35◦C using Clampex9.2 software
(Axon Instruments, Axoclamp-2A, San Jose, CA, United States).
For each iPSC-CM measured, the lowest membrane potential
(referred to as diastolic potential), threshold potential, peak spike
potential, and action potential duration were averaged from 5
action potentials per cell. Action potential duration (APD90) was
defined as the time (ms) from the start of the action potential
until membrane potential returned to 10% of its peak height.
Calcium Transients of iPSC-CMs
The iPSC-CMs were plated on an 18 mm2
round cover glass at
D15. At D20, the iPSC-CMs were incubated for 45 min at 35◦C in
0.5 mM Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution containing 2.5 µM of Fura-2 AM
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). Then, cover glasses
were inserted into a quick-release chamber (RC-49MFS, Warner
Instruments, Hamden, CT, United States) bathed in 1 mM Ca2+
Tyrode’s solution at 35◦C. Whole cell Ca2+ transients were
recorded using Fura-2 AM as described previously (Wang and
Fitts, 2018). Briefly, Fura-2 AM was excited at 340 and 380 nm
switching between wavelengths with a LAMBDA DG4 (Sutter
Instrument, Novato, CA, United States) and the fluorescence
emission measured at 510 nm. To determine the Ca2+ transient
rate of rise and fall and the peak amplitude, the ratio was analyzed
with IonWizard and data were expressed as ratio units (peak

Ca2+ transients were averaged for every iPSC-CM.
Protein Expression Analysis of iPSC-CMs
Sample Preparation
Following contractile studies, iPSC-CMs were scraped from cover
glasses into 1 mM Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution and centrifuged for
5 min at 16,100 × g. The pellet of iPSC-CMs was collected in
10 µl SDS sample buffer (10% SDS, 23 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol,
0.4% bromophenol blue, and 5.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8)
and stored at −80◦C until studied.
Silver Staining
MHC composition was determined by silver staining 5% SDS￾PAGE gels as previously described (Sundberg et al., 2018). Briefly,
gels were run for 28–30 h at 4◦C to separate α-MHC and β-MHC,
and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify
protein expression. Samples were also run for 1 h at 150 V
on 12% precast polyacrylamide gels using a Mini-PROTEAN
Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and
silver stained to examine lower molecular weight proteins.
Western Blotting
Diluted samples were run on a 4–15% gradient gel for 1 h at
150 V and transferred to a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane using
a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States)
at 100 V for 50 min. The gel was run in Tris-glycine running
buffer and transferred with running buffer containing 20%
methanol. Following transfer, membranes were blocked for
3 h in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-0.1% Tween pH 7.6
(TBST) and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4◦C.
Primary antibodies for MHC (MF20, 1:800, DSHB), GAPDH
(ab181602, 1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and
ventricular myosin light chain-2 (MLC2v) (7C9, 1:2,000, Fisher
Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States) were diluted in 5%
non-fat dry milk in TBST. Then, the blots were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(sc-516132, 1:6,500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; NBP2-30347H,
1:6,500, Novus Biologicals; G-21234, 1:1,600, Fisher Scientific,
Hampton, NH, United States) in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST
for 1 h at room temperature. Protein expression was detected
on autoradiography film (Hyblot CL, Fisher Scientific, Hampton,
NH, United States) by chemiluminescence. ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health) was used for densiometric analysis and
protein expression was normalized to GAPDH.
Tissue Sarcomere-Immunostaining
Tissue Sample Preparation
A total of 27 samples from atrial and ventricular tissues were
examined, including two 4-day old neonatal atrial tissues, one
from an HLHS subject without an MYH6 variant and one
from an HLHS subject with the MYH6-R443P variant. The
25 non-neonatal tissues were from subjects between 227 days
to 24-years old. These samples were divided into three study
groups: control (non-HLHS CHDs and structurally normal
cardiac control), HLHS subjects without an MYH6 variant, and
HLHS subjects with an MYH6 variant. In each study group,
when available, we included atrial and ventricular tissues. In all
cases, the samples were pieces of tissue dissected and phenotyped
at the time of surgery. They were snap frozen immediately
after removal from the patient. Some tissues came at the
time of heart implantation, and some came from the time of
reparative surgery.
Tissue Immunostaining
Cryo-sections (10 µm) of the frozen tissues were prepared. The
tissues were co-immunostained with anti-sarcomeric α-actinin
(AF594) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, United States) to image
sarcomere organization, and anti-MHC monoclonal MF20
(AF488) (DSHB, University of Iowa) to inform myocyte
identity. Sarcomeres in tissue sections and iPSC-CMs were
visualized with Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) at
1000x magnification.
Statistical Analyses
Characterization of Gene-Edited iPSC-CMs
Significant differences between two groups were analyzed
through an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test using Excel
(Microsoft). If the data were not normally distributed,
comparisons were made using the non-parametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Contractile Studies
When necessary, data were transformed to meet assumptions
of normality and homogeneity of variance. For the time course
study, a two-way ANOVA was performed to compare iPSC￾CM contractility of wild-type (WT) vs. variant (VAR; MYH6-
R443P) at timepoints D20, D27, D34, and D41. Post hoc pair-wise
comparisons were performed using Tukey’s test. All subsequent
studies (action potentials, contractile responses to stimulation,
isoproterenol, and Ca2+ transient recordings) were restricted to
D20. Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA, except for
stimulation data, which were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA.
Statistics were performed using Minitab v18.1 with significance
set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS
CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Edited iPSC-CMs
Insertion of the MYH6-R443P Variant Into the Heart
Healthy Parent’s iPSCs Results in Expression of the
Proband’s Sarcomere Phenotype
Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, the MYH6-R443P variant was
introduced into the heart healthy parent’s iPSCs, generating
CRISPRed control wild-type (WTcc) lines, as well as lines
having one allele (inserted +/VAR) or both alleles inserted
(inserted VAR/VAR). The CRISPR target site has one base￾pair mismatch, and the sequences of both MYH6 (Figure 1A)
and its close homologue MYH7 (Supplementary Figure S1)
were confirmed in CRISPRed iPSCs with Sanger sequencing
for any off-target effects. The experiments performed in
VAR-inserted cells were obtained with only one line per
genotype. Following cellular expansion and verification of

genotype, iPSCs representing WTcc, inserted +/VAR and
inserted VAR/VAR were induced to undergo cardiomyogenic
differentiation as we previously described (Kim et al., 2015)
(depicted in Figure 1B). The efficiency of cardiomyogenic
differentiation during D10–D15 was reduced in both the
inserted +/VAR and inserted VAR/VAR iPSC-CMs determined
by MF20 immunostaining (Figure 1C) and flow cytometry
assessment of % cTnT-positive cells (Figures 1D,E). We
also evaluated sarcomere structure in iPSC-CMs at later
stages of differentiation in both mass cultured CMs at D50
(Figure 1F) and individual CMs isolated from the culture at
D73 (Figure 1G). Over 100 isolated iPSC-CMs of each line
were judged for dysmorphic sarcomere organization at D69
and D73 (Figure 1H). “Normal” iPSC-CMs exhibit crisp and
elongated ladders with wide Z-bands. Dysmorphic iPSC-CMs
are characterized by more than 50% of the myocyte area
displaying blurred α-actinin staining and/or sarcomeric ladders
with punctate or truncated deposits of α-actinin (Figures 1G,H).
iPSC-CMs with the MYH6-R443P variant were substantially
disorganized in both the inserted +/VAR and inserted VAR/VAR
compared to WTcc-CMs.
Correction of the MYH6-R443P Variant in iPSCs
Normalizes the Proband’s Sarcomere Phenotype
Using CRISPR-Cas9, we corrected the MYH6-R443P variant
(corrected WT) in the proband’s iPSCs (Figure 2A). This
improved the efficiency of cardiomyogenic differentiation
as assessed by MF20 immunostaining (Figure 2B) and by
flow cytometric quantitation of the % of cTnT-positive cells
(Figures 2C,D). Perhaps most notable was the appearance
of the sarcomeres, which were relatively disorganized
in CRISPRed control proband (Probandcc) iPSC-CMs
expressing the R443P variant (Figure 2E, left) and became
organized upon correction in corrected WT iPSC-CMs
(Figure 2E, right).
Contractility of iPSC-CMs From WT, VAR,
and MYH6-R443P CRISPRed Lines
Contractile data were collected from WT (heart healthy
parent wild-type) and VAR (proband with the MYH6-R443P
variant) iPSC-CMs at time points D20, D27, D34, and D41
(Supplementary Table S1). WT iPSC-CMs showed a higher
percent shortening and relaxation rate at D20 compared to
VAR. However, by D27, there were no significant differences
in contractile parameters except values for contraction rate
per minute (CPM), which was higher in WT iPSC-CMs
(Supplementary Table S1). This indicates that the primary
difference in contractile parameters between WT and VAR
manifests at relatively early stages. Consequently, the focus of
our study shifted to a detailed examination of D20 cells. At
D20, the extent of shortening (µm), the % shortening, and the
rates of shortening and relaxation were higher in WT iPSC-CMs
in comparison with VAR (Table 2). In Figure 3A, the best-fit
lines demonstrate the measurement of maximal cell shortening
and relaxation rates. For this cell, we measured the following
parameters: CPM (WT, 57.2 and VAR, 45.7), shortening (WT,
2.9 µm and VAR, 2.4 µm), percent shortening (WT, 6.7%
and VAR, 4.3%), rate of shortening (WT, 28.3 µm/s and VAR
23.2 µm/s) and rate of relaxation (WT, 22.5 µm/s and VAR,
17.4 µm/s). Addition of 1 µM isoproterenol had no effect on
iPSC-CMs mechanics of either cell type. However, both cell
types responded to 1 Hz stimulation, contracting at 60 ± 4
(WT) and 64 ± 4 (VAR), and while CPM increased further
with 2 Hz stimulation, neither cell type was able to respond
at 2 Hz (WT, 73 ± 6 and VAR, 76 ± 8). The amplitude of
the Ca2+ transient was higher in WT compared to the VAR
(Figure 3B) cells, but no differences were observed in the
rate of rise or fall of the transient (Supplementary Table S2).
Isoproterenol had no effect on the amplitude of the Ca2+
transient in either cell type but did increase the rate of rise
and fall of the transient in the VAR (Supplementary Table S2).
Figure 3C shows representative action potentials for WT and
VAR at D20, followed by a 5 s recording from the same cell.
The APD90 for these cells are 298 and 300 ms for WT and
VAR, respectively.
Contractile data revealed that MYH6-R443P variant-inserted
iPSC-CMs contracted more slowly, while the % shortening
as well as the rates of shortening and relaxation were not
different between the WTcc vs. inserted +/VAR and inserted
VAR/VAR iPSC-CMs (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3).
All three of the CRISPRed genotypes responded to 1 and
2 Hz stimulation, but the inserted VAR/VAR iPSC-CMs had
a higher CPM compared to WTcc at 2 Hz (Supplementary
Table S3). The inserted VAR/VAR iPSC-CMs also had a greater
shortening rate compared to the inserted +/VAR iPSC-CMs
at 1 Hz but not 2 Hz. There were no differences in the
Ca2+ transients of the WTcc, inserted +/VAR and inserted
VAR/VAR iPSC-CMs (Supplementary Table S4). The mean
action potential characteristics for the WT, VAR, WTcc, inserted
+/VAR and inserted VAR/VAR were not different (Table 4).
This is important as it demonstrates that neither the variant nor
the CRISPR technology altered the electrical properties of the
sarcolemma membrane.
In mass cell cultures, using a separate automated contractility
software (see section “Materials and Methods” for details), we also
analyzed velocity of corrected WT iPSC-CMs at D20-D22. With
this analysis, we obtained similar results as single-cell studies.
Corrected WT iPSC-CMs exhibit faster contraction (Figure 4A,
P < 0.05) and increased velocity (Figure 4B, P < 0.0001)
compared to Probandcc iPSC-CMs.
Protein Expression of Typical Muscle
Proteins
Both α-MHC and β-MHC were present in WT iPSC-CMs
throughout the time course of D15-D34, while VAR iPSC-CMs
showed the presence of only β-MHC after D15 (Figure 5A). The
12% SDS gel (Supplementary Figure S2) shows that both cell
types contain multiple proteins known to exist in cardiac muscle,
including actin and MLC2v. Western blot analyses confirmed
the presence of MHC and MLC2v in all iPSC-CM samples and
densitometric analyses found no difference between cell types in
the expression of either total MHC (both α- and β- isoforms of
MHC) or MLC2v (Figure 5B).

Sarcomere Organization in Patient
Cardiac Tissues
We observed a dysmorphic sarcomere phenotype in cardiac
tissues from HLHS subjects with MYH6 variants. Detailed
sample information is listed in Table 5 and Supplementary
Table S5. We also identified combined annotation dependent
depletion (CADD) scores for variant pathogenicity for all the
MYH6 variants (GRCh38-v1.6 for SNP and GRCh38-v1.3 for
deletion): 26.5 for MYH6-R443P (Figure 6I), 25.9 for MYH6-
K849- (Figure 6J), 33 for MYH6-E1503V (Figure 6K), and
22.9 for MYH6-S385L/25.2 for M436V compound heterozygous
variant (Figure 6L; Rentzsch et al., 2019).
Sarcomeres in the atria and ventricles of healthy (Figures 6A–
D) and HLHS tissues without MYH6 variants (Figures 6E–H
and Supplementary Figures S4A–D,G) were organized except
two samples, which are further described below. This was also
the case in atrial tissues of other CHD subjects, including
Ebstein’s Anomaly (Figure 6A) and Dextrocardia (Figure 6B).
The organized sarcomere structure in HLHS patients without
the MYH6 variant is clearly seen by comparing the atrial tissue
in Figure 6E with the ventricular tissue in Figure 6M, both
obtained at the time of surgery from the same HLHS subject.
Notably, 3 of the 4 atrial tissues from HLHS subjects possessing
the MYH6 variant (Figures 6I–L) exhibited poor sarcomere
organization, while ventricular tissues showed normal structure
(Figures 6Q,R). Sarcomeres in atrial tissues from HLHS subjects
with MYH6 variants are absent, or if detectable are disorganized
[Figure 6I (MYH6-R443P), Figure 6J (MYH6-K849-), Figure 6K
(MYH6-E1503V)]. The MYH6-R443P variant is in the head
domain whereas MYH6-K849- and MYH6-E1503V are in the tail
domain. The atrial and the ventricular tissues in Figures 6J,R
are from a HLHS patient with MYH6- K849-, while the atrial
and the ventricular tissues in Figures 6K,Q are from a HLHS
patient with MYH6-E1503V. At the neonatal stage, sarcomeres
are organized in both atrial tissues from HLHS patients with
and without MYH6 variants (Supplementary Figure S3). The
atrial restriction of this sarcomere phenotype corresponds to
the predominance of MYH6 expression in the atria after the
neonatal stage. The samples in Supplementary Figure S3B were
from the same HLHS patient with MYH6-R443P (Figure 6I).
Additional samples exhibited disrupted sarcomeres in HLHS
subjects without an MYH6 variant, one carrying a Dystrophin
hemizygous variant (DMD-I228N, scaled CADD-score 26.6)
(Supplementary Figure S4E) while the other HLHS subject
did not reveal any sarcomere gene variants from whole exome
sequencing (Supplementary Figure S4F).
DISCUSSION
HLHS etiology remains incomplete, in part due to its diverse
phenotype and complex genetic inheritance, as well as

environmental factors. To understand the molecular and
cellular mechanisms of HLHS, we investigated patient-specific
HLHS etiology using an iPSC-CM model and examined cardiac
tissue from HLHS patients with sarcomere immunostaining. To
further demonstrate the impact of the MYH6-R443P variant
on HLHS, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate
isogenic controls. Insertion of the MYH6-R443P variant into
the heart healthy parent’s iPSCs recapitulated the dysmorphic
sarcomere phenotype (Figure 1) and contractile dysfunction
(compare Tables 2, 3). Correcting the MYH6-R443P variant in
the proband’s iPSCs rescued the phenotypes of decreased CM
differentiation efficiency, dysmorphic sarcomeres, and abnormal
CPM and velocity (Figure 4).
Based on functional analysis of iPSC-CMs with the MYH6-
R443P variant, the primary contractile defects were reduced
CPM, impaired cell shortening (expressed as a % of cell length),
and decreased rates of shortening and relaxation. These defects
occurred early (by D20) and likely resulted from reduced
development of the SR including the SERCA pump and the
increased expression of the slow β-MHC isoform in the variant
iPSC-CMs (Figure 5A). The reduced SR SERCA pump activity
would explain the slower relaxation rates in the VAR. Regarding
contraction rate, the β-MHC isoform is known to have a lower
ATPase activity which limits cross-bridge cycle speed, and skeletal
fibers containing this isoform are 3–4 times slower than α-MHC
fast fibers (Schluter and Fitts, 1994; Fitts, 2008). The reduced
contractile function in the MYH6-R443P variant compared to
WT iPSC-CMs at D20 may be due to delayed development, as
by D27 there were no differences in the contractility between
the WT and VAR. Beyond D27, the loss of difference between
cell types in contractile function was likely at least in part due
to delayed development of the VAR particularly the SR. This
is best demonstrated by the relaxation rate where at D20 the
WT was twofold higher but by D27 the VAR relaxation rate
had increased to match the WT (Supplementary Table S1).
Despite no differences in shortening rate between WT and
VAR past D20, the β-MHC content remained high in the VAR
from D21 through D34 (Figure 5). We know iPSC-CMs are
immature at D20, which may explain why cell contractility
was not increased by adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol
(Supplementary Table S2). This lack of response most likely
indicates immaturity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but also
could indicate lack of the ß1 receptor on the surface membrane
(Pillekamp et al., 2012).
The MYH6-R443P variant showed a reduced amplitude of
the Ca2+ transients upon activation compared to WT, but
both showed diminished Ca2+ release compared to adult rat
ventricular cardiac cells (Wang and Fitts, 2017). It is likely that
the reduced Ca2+ release relates to lower sarcoplasmic reticulum
content and not to differences in surface membrane activation, as
the recorded action potentials were identical between the WT and
VAR. Differences in membrane excitability at D20 were noted,
indicated by lower CPM in the VAR compared to the WT. Since
the lowest membrane potential (referred to as diastolic potential)

and the threshold potential were not different between cell
types, this suggests that the rate of spontaneous depolarization
to threshold may have been faster in the WT. However, our
recordings did not show an obvious difference in the rate of
depolarization to threshold between cell types (Figure 3 and
Table 4). This may be because the difference is too small for
detection during the single-cell level experiments performed at
D20. Sorting out differences between the WT and VAR iPSC-CMs

will require additional studies of organelle function (particularly
the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofilaments).
The basic contractile unit of striated (cardiac and skeletal)
muscle is the sarcomere, a highly ordered structure containing
contractile and regulatory proteins. Disruptions in sarcomere
proteins have been implicated in many cardiac diseases
(Redwood et al., 1999; Seidman and Seidman, 2001; Richard
et al., 2003; Laing and Nowak, 2005). Here, we observed
dysmorphic sarcomeres in tissues from HLHS patients with
certain MYH6 variants and these changes were phenocopied in
iPSC-CMs generated from a HLHS patient with the MYH6-
R443P variant. Sarcomere disorganization in cardiac tissues
from three out of four HLHS patients with MYH6 variants
was observed in atrial but not in ventricular tissues (Figure 6).
This result was expected as α-MHC protein expression is
predominantly in the postnatal atria in humans. Likely, the
in vivo contractile dysfunction is mainly in the atria, with the
hypoplastic ventricular phenotype representing a developmental
response resultant from diminished inflow pulsatility. Adding to
the idea that poorly organized sarcomeres might contribute to the
development of HLHS, atrial tissues from a HLHS patient with a
costameric variant in Dystrophin (DMD) also showed sarcomere
disruption (Supplementary Figure S4E). Furthermore, we
observed that variants with the highest scaled CADD-scores:
MYH6-R443P (26.5), MYH6-K849- (25.9), MYH6-E1503V (33)
and DMD-I288N (26.6) had the most apparent disruptions in
sarcomere structure in atrial tissues ex vivo. One limitation
was lack of paired controls, however tissue samples showed
convincing evidence of abnormalities (Figure 6).
Investigating HLHS etiology requires a physiological system
of electrically and mechanically connected iPSC-CMs. One
concern with employing iPSCs is the clonal variability; to
reduce variability, we conducted all experiments multiple times
(as indicated in each figure legend) in a non-biased, blinded
fashion. A WT line was always differentiated along with
experimental lines to compare differences among cell types at
each differentiation stage. Additionally, isogenic MYH6-R443P
cell lines were created using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and these
lines recapitulated the phenotypes of patient-specific MYH6-
R443P iPSC-CMs. An additional limitation is the heterogenous
population of iPSC-CMs, including both atrial and ventricular
cells. There are MLC-2a, MLC-2v, as well as double-positive
iPSC-CMs in our cultures upon immunostaining at D31-D35
(data not shown). As our protein expression (Figure 5) and
automated contractility assays (Figure 4) were analyzed in masse,
they may underestimate the true heterogeneity of our cells. While
we have a relatively pure population of cTnT positive CMs that
express our cardiac gene of interest, MYH6, single-cell analyses
similar to those completed by other groups may help further
clarify their composition (Weber et al., 2016).

Kim et al. iPSC-CMs With MYH6-R443P in HLHS
Despite being relatively immature, iPSC-CMs expressing the
MYH6-R443P allele showed morphological and physiological
differences from WT. iPSC-CMs could be used for clinical
applications such as pharmacological drug testing, but these
applications require mature CMs. A number of strategies have
been employed to promote the maturity of iPSC-CMs, including:
the administration of biochemical agents [adrenergic receptor
agonists, Triiodothyronine (Yang et al., 2014b; Jackman et al.,
2018), insulin-like growth factor 1 or microRNA (mir1 or
mir208)], altering substrate stiffness or utilizing molds for cell￾patterning (Ribeiro et al., 2015, 2016, 2017; Carson et al.,
2016; Jung et al., 2016), application of mechanical stimuli
(Hirt et al., 2014), and co-culture with different cell types to
mimic human tissue, including bioengineering of 3D tissue
(Yang et al., 2014a; Ronaldson-Bouchard et al., 2018). iPSC￾CM maturation can then be confirmed using a multiparametric
quality assessment, including gene expression profiling and
structural, electrophysiological, and contractile measurements
(Sheehy et al., 2014).
We showed contractile and sarcomere organization
differences between WT and MYH6-R443P iPSC-CMs,
however, how the early stage CM-phenotype affects cardiac
morphogenesis in vivo and how this phenotype progresses to
adulthood is complex and not understood. To investigate this
progression in vivo it may be beneficial to use an animal model
in parallel with iPSC-CMs. While murine models have opposite
chamber-specific expression of Myh6 and Myh7, zebrafish may
be a suitable alternative for studying MYH6-associated CHD
despite having a two-chambered heart. Importantly, zebrafish
chamber-specific MHC expression is the same as humans. The
phenotype of weak atrium (wea) myh6-mutant zebrafish exhibits
a hypoplastic ventricle (Berdougo et al., 2003).
Our study proposes a new potential mechanism for the
development of HLHS related to MYH6-R443P: sarcomere
disorganization likely causes decreased atrial contractility and
results in hypoplastic left ventricular development. The failing
structural and contractile changes of the atrial sarcomere may
effect hemodynamic changes that prevent the development of
a normal left ventricle and downstream structures including
the mitral valve, the aortic valve and the aorta. In addition,
postnatally, atrial dysfunction due to sarcomere disorganization
in single ventricle patients may result in decreased atrial kick,
which would be expected to lead to heart failure over time.
Further studies are needed to test potential ways to correct these
contractile changes. It is possible that drugs targeting contractility
may be able to alleviate some of the contractile changes due
to the MYH6-R443P variant. Ultimately, we may be able to
alter the developmental pathways and minimize or prevent the
development of MYH6 variant associated HLHS.
