ABSTRACT
Background Human bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (hMSCs) improve
survival in mouse models of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and reduce pulmonary oedema in a
perfused human lung preparation injured with
Escherichia coli bacteria. We hypothesised that clinical
grade hMSCs would reduce the severity of acute lung
injury (ALI) and would be safe in a sheep model of
ARDS.
Methods Adult sheep (30–40 kg) were surgically
prepared. After 5 days of recovery, ALI was induced with
cotton smoke insufflation, followed by instillation of live
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5×1011 CFU) into both
lungs under isoflurane anaesthesia. Following the injury,
sheep were ventilated, resuscitated with lactated Ringer’s
solution and studied for 24 h. The sheep were randomly
allocated to receive one of the following treatments
intravenously over 1 h in one of the following groups:
(1) control, PlasmaLyte A, n=8; (2) lower dose hMSCs,
5×106 hMSCs/kg, n=7; and (3) higher-dose hMSCs,
10×106 hMSCs/kg, n=4.
Results By 24 h, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly
improved in both hMSC treatment groups compared with
the control group (control group: PaO2/FiO2 of
97±15 mm Hg; lower dose: 288±55 mm Hg (p=0.003);
higher dose: 327±2 mm Hg (p=0.003)). The median
lung water content was lower in the higher-dose hMSC￾treated group compared with the control group (higher
dose: 5.0 g wet/g dry [IQR 4.9–5.8] vs control:
6.7 g wet/g dry [IQR 6.4–7.5] (p=0.01)). The hMSCs
had no adverse effects.
Conclusions Human MSCs were well tolerated and
improved oxygenation and decreased pulmonary oedema
in a sheep model of severe ARDS.

INTRODUCTION
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
a common cause of acute respiratory failure and is
often caused by pneumonia and/or sepsis.1–3 ARDS
is characterised by severe pulmonary oedema,
leading to arterial hypoxaemia (PaO2/
FiO2<300 mm Hg).4 Advances have been made in
understanding the pathophysiology of ARDS, but
therapies remain limited. Supportive care with lung
protective ventilation,5 prone ventilation6 and a
conservative fluid management strategy7 have
improved clinical outcomes, but no specific therapy
has improved survival. Thus, new treatments are
needed.
In this regard, cell-based therapies may be promis￾ing for treatment of patients with ARDS. Bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells
(MSCs) have shown therapeutic value in preclinical
studies of myocardial infarction,8 diabetes,9
sepsis,10 hepatic failure,11 acute renal failure12 and
acute lung injury (ALI).13 Work from our laboratory
demonstrated that intravenously administered clin￾ical grade, allogeneic human bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) restored alveolar
fluid clearance to a normal level and decreased
inflammation in an ex vivo isolated human lung
preparation injured with live bacteria.14 We also
reported that intravenous hMSCs increased survival
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Will intravenous delivery of bone
marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem
(stromal) cells reduce the severity of lung injury
in a clinically relevant 24 h sheep model of
severe pneumonia-related acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS)?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Treatment with human mesenchymal stem
(stromal) cells reduced the severity of
inhalational and bacterial inoculation induced
lung injury as measured by improved
oxygenation and decrease of extravascular lung
water without adverse effects on
haemodynamics.
Why read on?
▸ Because this preclinical study provides
additional data to support the potential value
of testing human bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells in patients
with moderate to severe ARDS.

in a rodent model of gram-negative peritoneal sepsis15 and in a
mouse model of pneumonia.16
In the present study, we hypothesised that clinical grade
hMSCs would reduce the severity of lung injury and would be
well tolerated in a sheep model of ARDS induced by cotton
smoke inhalation and instillation of live Pseudomonas aerugi￾nosa into both lungs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch and
conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the National
Institute of Health and the American Physiological Society for
the care and use of laboratory animals.
Surgical procedures
Adult sheep were surgically prepared 5–7 days before the
experiment. The surgical protocol has been described in previ￾ous studies.17 18 Briefly, under isoflurane anaesthesia (Aestiva/5,
Compact 7100, Tec 7 vaporizer, Datex Ohmeda, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA) administered via endotracheal tube, the right
femoral artery was cannulated for arterial access (Intracath,
16GA, 24IN, Becton Dickinson, Sandy, Utah, USA) and a ther￾modilution catheter (Swan Ganz, model 131F7, Baxter,
Edwards Division, Irvine, California, USA) was introduced
through the right common jugular vein into the pulmonary
artery. A catheter (Duralastic Silicone Tubing DT08, 0.062 in.
ID, Allied Biomedical, Paso Robles, California, USA) was also
positioned in the left atrium through the fifth intercostal space.
To determine pulmonary transvascular fluid flux (lung lymph
flow), a thoracotomy in the sixth intercostal space was per￾formed and the efferent vessel of the caudal mediastinal lymph
node was cannulated with Silastic medical grade tubing (0.025
in. ID, Dow Corning, Midland, Michigan, USA). Following the
operative procedures, sheep were awakened and the catheters
were connected to monitors through pressure transducers.
During the 5-day recovery period, the condition of the sheep
was checked three times daily to ensure good recovery as
demonstrated by lack of fever, appropriate eating and drinking,
and good physical appearance.
Experimental protocol
After 5 days of recovery, baseline values were obtained and a
tracheostomy was done under ketamine/isoflurane anaesthesia.
Smoke inhalation injury was produced by insufflation of cotton
smoke as previously described.19 20 Four sets of 12 breaths of
smoke were delivered. Following the inhalation injury, P. aeruginosa
(American Type Culture Collection) was instilled through a bron￾choscope (Model PF-P40, Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).
The P. aeruginosa (strain 12-4-4) had been cultured overnight and
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The bacteria were mixed with
saline and their numbers adjusted to ∼2.5×1011 CFU in 30 mL
solution. Aliquots (10 mL) of the bacterial mixture were instilled
into the right middle, right lower and left lower lobes (30 mL
total).19 20 After the injury, the sheep were ventilated (Servo
Ventilator 300C, Siemens-Elema, Sweden) with positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O and a tidal volume of
15 mL/kg throughout the 24 h experimental period. The inspira￾tory concentration of O2 was maintained at 100% for the first 3 h
following injury and adjusted thereafter according to blood gas ana￾lysis. The respiratory rate was initially set at 20/min, and it was
adjusted according to arterial CO2 concentration. All sheep
received maintenance intravenous fluid during the study period,
initially with lactated Ringer’s solution at 4 mL/kg/h, after which
the infusion rate was adjusted to maintain the haematocrit close to
baseline levels (± 3%).
Control and hMSC-treated groups
Two or three sheep were injured at one time and then studied
simultaneously. After injury, each sheep was randomly allocated
to one of three groups1
: control (treated with PlasmaLyte A
only, n=8)2
; lower dose hMSCs (treated with 5×106
/kg
hMSCs, n=7); and3 higher dose hMSCs (treated with 10×106
/
kg hMSCs, n=4). Each experimental group always included one
control sheep. Clinical grade hMSCs were obtained from the
NHLBI Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies at the
University of Minnesota. Prior to administration, the cryopre￾served hMSCs were thawed in a water bath, washed with
PlasmaLyte A and centrifuged to remove the DMSO and cell
debris in the supernatant. They were then resuspended in
PlasmaLyte A and counted prior to infusion. The cells were
administered intravenously over 1 h via central line, starting 1 h
after injury.
Measurements
Several cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously,
including pulmonary arterial, central venous, systemic arterial
and left atrial pressures. Cardiac output was measured by ther￾modilution technique using a cardiac output computer
(COM-1TM, Baxter, Edward Division). Peak airway and pause
airway pressures (similar to plateau airway pressure in patients
ventilated with volume control ventilation) were measured
hourly. Arterial blood gases were analysed at multiple time
points (GEM Premier 3000, Instrumental Laboratory,
Lexington, Massachusetts, USA). Lymph flow and lymph and
plasma protein concentrations were measured hourly from
hours 1 through 6, and every third hour thereafter. It was
assumed that lymph flow remained constant during the 3 h
intervals. The pulmonary transvascular fluid flux was evaluated
every 3 h based on the lung lymph flow measurements.17 18
Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was calculated using
standard equations. Urine output was measured every 3 h.
Chemistry measurements
Serum BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, lactate and glucose were mea￾sured at baseline, 12 and 24 h.
Prespecified criteria for euthanasia
Systolic blood pressure <50 mm Hg, heart rate <40 beats per
minute over 1 h, arterial PaO2 <50 mm Hg at FiO2=1.0 over
1 h or an arterial PaCO2>90 mm Hg were prespecified as cri￾teria for euthanasia. Sheep that did not require euthanasia prior
to the end of the experimental period were sacrificed under
deep anaesthesia 24 h after injury.
Postmortem bronchoalveolar lavage
A modified 14 French Foley catheter was wedged in a subseg￾mental division of the left lower lobe, and 40 mL of room tem￾perature normal saline was instilled and the lavage fluid was
aspirated. Unspun samples were used to determine the bacterial
and neutrophil counts (Hemavet HV950FS, Drew Scientific,
Inc., Oxford, Connecticut, USA).
Postmortem lung wet-to-dry weight ratio
The right lung and the upper half of the left lower lobe were
used for determination of bloodless wet-to-dry weight ratio.21

Statistical analyses
Bivariate analysis was used for baseline data. Continuous variables
are expressed as mean ±SE and compared using one-way ANOVA
tests with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Wet-to-dry weight ratios and bacterial and neutrophil counts in
BAL fluid are presented as median with IQRs; they were compared
using Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance, followed by
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests with Bonferroni adjustments
because they were not normally distributed.
For variables measured repeatedly over 24 h, the data are pre￾sented as mean and SEs at different time points, and include
available data from the four sheep that expired prior to 24 h. To
assess the impact of hMSC treatment on each measurement at
the 24 h time point, analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) was per￾formed, controlling for the baseline level. Only the 15 sheep
that survived the full 24 h were included in the ANCOVA ana￾lyses at 24 h. Furthermore, a generalised estimating equation
(GEE) approach was used to test the impact of hMSC treatment
over time, taking repeated measurements into account and using
an exchangeable correlation matrix with robust variance estima￾tor. An interaction term with treatment group and time was
introduced into the full model and was removed for p￾values>0.05. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statis￾tically significant.
RESULTS
There were no differences among the three study groups in any
of the variables at baseline.
Mortality
Four sheep required euthanasia by the prespecified criteria
before the end of 24 h, including 2 of 8 control sheep (at 12 h
and 15 h), 1 of 7 lower-dose hMSC-treated sheep (at 18h) and
1 of 4 higher-dose hMSC-treated sheep (at 21 h).
Systemic haemodynamics
Heart rate increased in all three groups after injury compared to
baseline (figure 1A). At 24 h, sheep treated with higher-dose
hMSCs had an attenuated increase in heart rate compared with
control sheep (p=0.01). In the 15 sheep alive at 24 h, systemic
blood pressure (mean) was higher in sheep treated with higher￾dose hMSCs at 24 h compared with controls (p=0.05).

Systemic blood pressure in the high-dose group was also higher
over the entire 24 h compared with controls (p=0.004) (figure
1B). The cardiac output did not differ among the three groups
during the experimental period (table 1). Systemic vascular
resistance index (figure 1C) was not different among the three
groups. At 24 h, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (figure
1D) was lower only in the lower-dose hMSC-treated sheep
(p=0.007). Except for one time point, the haematocrit was not
different among the three groups (table 1). There were also no
differences in arterial pH levels after the injury among the three
groups (table 1).
Pulmonary haemodynamics
The mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased after injury in
all three groups and remained elevated throughout the study
period (figure 2A). At 24 h, the surviving sheep treated with
either lower or higher dose hMSCs had significantly attenuated
increases in pulmonary arterial pressure compared with sheep in
the control group (p<0.001 and p=0.008, respectively).
Pulmonary arterial pressure was also lower during the 24 h
period in the high-dose hMSC-treated sheep compared with the
control sheep (p=0.04) (figure 2A). Pulmonary vascular resist￾ance index (figure 2B) was not different at 24 h or during the
experimental period.
Airway pressures
The peak and pause airway pressures increased in all three
groups compared with baseline, but there were no differences
among the groups over time or at 24 h (figure 3A and B). While
peak airway pressures were numerically lowest in the higher￾dose hMSC group, this difference did not quite reach signifi￾cance (p=0.08).
Lung lymph flow and protein balance
Lymph flow and lymph protein flux increased in all groups but
there were no statistical differences among the groups (see
online supplementary material).
Total fluid balance
The control sheep accumulated 3 L over 24 h and sheep treated
with lower dose hMSCs accumulated 2.5 L, while sheep treated
with the higher dose hMSCs had an even fluid balance (figure 4).

The fluid intake was similar in all three groups, but the higher￾dose hMSC-treated sheep had numerically more urine output.
The differences in fluid balance were not statistically significant.
Chemistry measurements
There were no differences in the serum BUN, creatinine, ALT,
lactate or glucose among the three groups at baseline, 12 or
24 h (table 2). Serum AST was significantly lower in the sheep
treated with lower dose hMSCs vs control sheep (p=0.03).
Oxygenation
The control sheep developed severe hypoxaemia that progressed
throughout the experimental period; at 24 h the PaO2/FiO2
ratio was 97±15 mm Hg (figure 5). In the 15 sheep that
remained alive at the 24 h time point, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was
significantly higher in both hMSC-treated groups compared
with the control group (lower dose: 288±55 mm Hg
(P=0.003); higher dose: 327±2 mm Hg (P=0.003)) (figure 5).
The PaO2/FiO2 ratios in both the lower-dose and higher-dose
hMSC groups were also numerically higher than in the control
group over the 24 h period; this difference almost reached stat￾istical significance (p=0.07 and p=0.053, respectively).
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bacterial and neutrophil counts
There were no differences in the median number of bacteria in
control sheep or in the number of neutrophils (see online sup￾plementary material).

Postmortem extravascular lung water
Lung water content was lower in the higher-dose hMSC-treated
group (median=5.0 g wet/g dry [IQR 4.9–5.8]) compared with
the control group (median=6.7 g wet/g dry [IQR 6.4–7.5])
(p=0.01). There was no statistical difference in lung water
content in the lower-dose hMSC-treated group compared with
the control group (p=0.73) (figure 6).
DISCUSSION
There were two primary objectives of this preclinical
large-animal sheep study. The first was to test the safety of
hMSCs in critically ill sheep with ALI. The second was to test
the efficacy of hMSCs in the treatment of ALI with the primary
focus on lung fluid balance and oxygenation, and to determine
whether there were any significant differences between a lower
and a higher dose of hMSCs. Both doses of hMSCs were well
tolerated. Both doses of hMSCs were associated with improved
oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) at 24 h, and the higher dose of
hMSCs decreased the quantity of postmortem pulmonary
oedema. These results provide the foundation for translation to
test hMSCs in critically ill patients with moderate-to-severe
ARDS in a phase 1/2 clinical trial.22
We and other investigators have completed several preclinical
studies in small animal models, as well as studies in an ex vivo
perfused human lung preparation. Prior to this study, however,
there had been no clinically relevant studies of hMSCs in a large
animal model of ALI. This model is analogous to the clinical
setting because the sheep were managed as if they were in an
intensive care unit; three investigators stayed with the sheep at
all times throughout the 24 h time period, adjusting the ventila￾tor settings and fluid administration, and monitoring haemo￾dynamics, gas exchange and several other variables.
Additionally, the sheep received positive pressure ventilation and
PEEP, similar to patients with ARDS. Thus, multiple features
allowed by this large animal model make it more a more rele￾vant comparison to human patients with ARDS; most of these
features simply cannot be replicated in small animals or in the
ex vivo perfused human lung.
Equally important, the sheep model made it possible to
measure several clinically relevant physiological endpoints for
both pulmonary and systemic circulation, and to obtain labora￾tory data regarding kidney function, liver function, and acid
base status. Finally, we were able to measure peak and pause
(plateau) airway pressure, as well as to obtain postmortem data
on the quantity of pulmonary oedema, adding to our ability to
test for safety and efficacy.
The testing of hMSCs in critically ill large animals with ALI
for safety is perhaps most important. The safety record of
hMSCs in several clinical trials has been excellent, but we
wanted to determine whether intravenous administration of
hMSCs would result in a significant increase in pulmonary arter￾ial pressure (an effect that could decrease in right ventricular
stroke volume and cause systemic hypotension). The results
demonstrate that there were no differences in pulmonary vascu￾lar resistance, cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance
among the three groups. In particular, mean pulmonary arterial
pressure was significantly lower at 24 h in both the lower-dose
and higher-dose hMSC-treated sheep compared with the
control sheep. Thus, hMSCs did not compromise pulmonary
haemodynamics and may have even exerted a favourable effect
on the acutely injured pulmonary circulation. Similarly, the sys￾temic arterial pressure was higher at 24 h in the higher-dose
hMSC-treated sheep compared with the control and lower-dose
hMSC-treated sheep, suggesting no deleterious effect of hMSCs
on systemic haemodynamics, and potentially a favourable effect
on systemic blood pressure with the higher hMSC dose. Taken
together, these results provide some reassurance that testing of
this cell-based therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe
ARDS is warranted in terms of anticipated tolerability.
In regards to efficacy, oxygenation was significantly improved
at 24 h in the sheep treated with either dose of hMSCs com￾pared with the controls. There was also a trend for oxygenation
to be higher in both hMSC-treated groups throughout the
entire 24 h period, although this trend did not achieve statistical
significance. Additionally, the postmortem measurement of
extravascular lung water (a standard measure for the quantity of

pulmonary oedema) showed a significant decrease in sheep
treated with the higher dose of hMSCs. Although both doses
were effective in improving oxygenation, the evidence that
extravascular lung water was significantly reduced in the higher￾dose hMSC group provides a rationale for making the higher
dose (10×106 cells/kg) the target dose for testing tolerability
and efficacy in a clinical trial of hMSCs for ARDS.
There are several limitations to this study. First, this study of
ALI in sheep models only the first 24 h of human ARDS.
Logistically it was not possible to sustain this model for more
than 24 h. Second, it will not be possible to administer hMSCs
in the clinical setting of ARDS within 1 h of injury to the lung.
Thus, when tested in patients, the time window for treatment
after ARDS develops will be longer. Third, although the sheep
model includes the lung physiologic abnormalities that occur in
patients with ARDS, and also replicates some of the
process-of-care variables (positive pressure ventilation and intra￾venous fluid administration), it does not reflect the comorbid￾ities that complicate the course of many patients with ARDS
(eg, diabetes, immunosuppression and advanced age).
Moreover, we did not test the effect of antibiotics in this model,
although we have recently reported the differential effect of
antibiotics and hMSCs in our ex vivo perfused human lung
experiments.14 Finally, although investigators were not aware of
the treatment arm to which sheep would be assigned before
injury, they were not blinded to treatment group after injury.
In summary, administration of hMSCs in sheep with severe
lung injury demonstrated no safety issues. Moreover, there was
evidence of efficacy in terms of improved oxygenation with
either dose of hMSCs, and a decrease in the quantity of pul￾monary oedema in the sheep treated with the higher dose of
hMSCs. Based on these results, our plan is to proceed to clinical
testing of allogeneic bone marrow-derived hMSCs in patients
with moderate-to-severe ARDS with an FDA-reviewed clinical
trial22
