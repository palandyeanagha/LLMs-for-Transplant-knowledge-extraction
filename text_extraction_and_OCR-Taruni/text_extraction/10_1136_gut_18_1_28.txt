SUMMARY Increased antibody production and hypergammaglobulinaemia in cirrhosis are probably
to a large extent due to decreased hepatic extraction of antigens. The decreased extraction is pre￾sumably related to changed microcirculation caused by damaged anatomical structure of the liver.
It is therefore to be expected that immunoglobulin and antibody levels in serum in cirrhotic patients
are related to the degree of certain morphological changes of the liver. This hypothesis has been
tested. In 50 patients with cirrhosis, 28 alcoholics and 22 non-alcoholics, the degree of architectural
destruction, the degree of fibrosis, the degree of fatty infiltration, and the degree of 'activity' were
compared with immunoglobulins G, A, and M and E. coli 0 antibody levels. The comparison was
carried out within each of the aetiological groups. Identical relationships were found in both groups.
Patients with completely destroyed lobular architecture had higher levels of E. coli 0 antibodies
than patients with partly destroyed architecture. Patients with severe fibrosis had higher IgA and
E. coli 0 antibody levels than patients with moderate or slight fibrosis. Patients with moderate and
severe steatosis and patients with no or slight steatosis had the same immunoglobulin and E. coli
O antibody levels. Patients with active cirrhosis had higher IgG levels than patients with inactive
cirrhosis. When architectural destruction and fibrosis were combined significantly higher IgG,
IgA, IgM, and E. coli antibodies were found in the group with the most severe changes. These
findings support the hypothesis that immunoglobulin and antibody levels are related to the degree
of morphological changes in the liver-namely, destruction of lobular architecture, fibrosis, and
'activity'.
Hepatic extraction of substances normally phago￾cytised by the Kupffer cells is decreased in cirrhosis
of the liver (Halpern et al., 1959; Rankin et al.,
1961). In experimental cirrhosis decreased hepatic
uptake of antigens is accompanied by increased
splenic uptake (Thomas et al., 1973) and increased
antibody production (Triger and Wright, 1973).
Kupffer cell blockade influences hepatic and splenic
uptake as well as antibody production in the same
way (Souhami, 1972; Souhami et al., 1975). Nor￾mally functioning Kupffer cells destroy the immuno￾genicity of phagocytised antigens (Inchley, 1969;
Franzl, 1972; Archer and Wust, 1973). The decreased
hepatic uptake and elimination of antigens resulting
in a spillover of antigen to antibody producing sites

such as the spleen is now considered the main cause
for the increased antibody production and hyper￾gammaglobulinaemia in cirrhosis (Bj0rneboe et al.,
1972; Triger et al., 1972; Prytz et al., 1974). The
reduction in hepatic uptake of antigens is directly
related to the histological severity of experimental
cirrhosis in rats (Thomas et al., 1973). The purpose
of this study is to investigate if this is true for human
cirrhosis as well.
Methods
Fifty consecutive patients were studied, in whom liver
biopsies performed according to the method of Men￾ghini exhibited cirrhosis defined as a diffuse lesion
of the liver with regeneration nodules and fibrosis.

Correlation between hepatic morphology and immunoglobulins and antibodies to E. coli in cirrhosis
They were divided into two aetiological groups,
alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Alcoholic cirrhosis is
cirrhosis in patients who admitted to have been
drinking more than 50 g ethanol a day for more than
five years. At the same time as the biopsy was
performed serum immunoglobulin concentrations
were determined by electrophoresis in antibody￾containing agarose gel (Laurell, 1966). E. coli 0
group antibodies in serum were measured by
agglutinin titration as described elsewhere (Bj0rne￾boe et al., 1972). Each serum was tested with 12
common 0 group antigens. A titre of 1:40 was
considered to be positive. The result of the E. coli
antibody determinations was indicated as the
number of positive reactions per serum.
The assessment of the liver biopsies was performed
without knowledge of the clinical data. The degree
of destruction of lobular architecture was indicated
as partly or completely destroyed lobular architec￾ture depending on the presence or absence of
demonstrable remnants of lobules in the biopsy.
The fibrosis was registered semi-quantitatively
according to the amount of connective tissue related
to the amount of parenchyme in the following
manner: slight fibrosis (+) when the fibrous tissue
surrounding the parenchymal nodules was seen as
slender septa, moderate fibrosis (+ +) if the septa
were broad, and severe (+ + +) when large con￾fluent areas of fibrosis were predominant.
The degree of histological activity (inactive or
active) was graded on the basis of the amount of
liver cell necroses and the mesenchymal reaction on
these. The liver cell necroses (focal, piecemeal,
alcoholic hepatitis, lipogranulomas, and the ac￾companying mesenchymal reaction) were registered
and the cases were graded as inactive or active in the
following manner: inactive-none or only one or two
liver cell necroses per nodule; active-more than
two liver cell necroses per nodule.
The fatty changes were quantified in the following
manner: + -the biopsy specimens contain fatty
vacuoles, but on an average in less than one third of
the cells; + + -the specimens contain fatty vacuoles
in one-third or more but in less than two-thirds of
the cells; + ++ -the specimens contain fatty
vacuoles in two-thirds or more of the cells.
The following analysis was carried out in each of
the two aetiological groups. Immunoglobulin G, A,
and M and E. coli antibodies expressed as number of
positive reactions have been compared in subgroups
with different degrees of each morphological
abnormality.
Results
The patients comprised 27 males and 23 females.
Twenty-eight were chronic alcoholics, while 22
patients denied ethanol abuse. No patient had
clinical evidence of biliary tract infection but two
had urinary tract infections with E. coli-that is,
growth of more than 105 E. coli per ml midstream
urine. The age range in years was, for the 28 alco￾holics, 33-74 years (median 55 years) and, for the
22 non-alcoholics, 22-81 years (median 63 years).
Fifteen patients had ascites and 4 had oesophageal
varices demonstrated by radiography. The main
histological features of the liver biopsies are shown
in Table 1. Completely destroyed lobular architecture
was more frequent in alcoholic than in non-alcoholic
cirrhosis. Moderate and severe fatty change was
seen in 43 % of the alcoholics, whereas it was never
demonstrated in the non-alcoholics. Active cirrhosis

was more often seen in non-alcoholics. The immuno￾globulin concentrations and E. coli antibody levels
in the two groups are shown in Table 2. IgG levels
are higher in non-alcoholic cirrhosis, whereas IgA
and E. coli antibody levels are higher in alcoholic
cirrhosis. The relationship between the different
morphological features and immunoglobulin con￾centrations and E. coli antibody levels within each
aetiological group are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
With regard to the destruction of lobular archi￾tecture, E. coli levels were highest in the groups with
completely destroyed architecture in alcoholics as
well as in non-alcoholics. However, the difference
was significant only in the alcoholic group. With
regard to fibrosis IgA levels were significantly higher
in the groups with severe fibrosis in the alcoholics as
well as in the non-alcoholics. There were significant
differences between IgG and the number of E. coli
reactions in the group of alcoholics but not in the
non-alcoholics. With regard to histological 'activity'
IgG levels were significantly higher in active cirrhosis
in the alcoholics as well as in the non-alcoholics.
IgA was also higher in both groups with active
cirrhosis, but only significantly so in the non￾alcoholics. Finally, when immunoglobulins and E.
coli antibody levels were compared in two groups of
alcoholic cirrhosis-patients with completely des￾troyed lobular architecture and + + + fibrosis, and
patients with less severe morphological changes￾IgG, IgA, IgM and E. coli antibodies were signifi￾cantly higher in the former group (Table 5). The
comparison could not be made in the non-alcoholic
group because of the small number of cases. Alcoholic
patients with severe or moderate steatosis had no

Correlation between hepatic morphology and immunoglobulins and antibodies to E. coli in cirrhosis 31
significantly different E. coli antibody or Ig levels
from patients with slight or no steatosis (figures not
shown).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that a relationship can be
found between certain changes in the liver structure
in alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis, and
immunoglobulins and E. coli antibody levels. The
results cannot be biased by aetiological factors, as
the data have been analysed within each aetiological
group. Destruction of lobular architecture influences
E. coli antibody levels, fibrosis influences IgA and
E. coli antibody levels, and 'activity' influences IgG
levels. Steatosis of different degrees has no effect on
immunoglobulins or E. coli antibody levels in
alcoholic cirrhosis.
The study suggests that structural changes in the
liver have an effect on immunoglobulin and E. coli
antibody production in cirrhosis. The various
morphological changes do not influence the different
Ig classes and E. coli antibodies with the same
intensity. However, when the alcoholic cases are
divided into two groups-those with total archi￾tectural destruction and severe fibrosis, and those
with less severe changes-all Ig classes and E. coli
antibody levels are higher in the former group.
Structural changes may influence antibody produc￾tion through changes in the hepatic extraction of
antigens. In human alcoholic cirrhosis an increase of
individual cellular reticuloendothelial phagocytic
activity was found, while the total reticuloendo￾thelial phagocytic capacitywas reduced. This capacity
was closely correlated with reticuloendothelial
perfusion (Cooksley et al., 1973). Reduced hepatic
uptake of antigens in human cirrhosis is therefore
most probably caused by decreased sinusoidal blood
flow. This has recently been shown also in animal
experiments (Lloyd and Triger, 1975). Architectural
destruction with formation of regenerative nodules,
fibrosis, and 'activity' may all influence the micro￾circulation of the liver and reduce the sinusoidal
blood flow (Leevy et al., 1958; Shaldon et al., 1961;
Preisig et al., 1966; Rappaport et al., 1966; Reynolds
et al., 1969).
Findings of the relationship between liver mor￾phology and IgG and E. coli antibodies can be
explained, if a decreased extraction of antigens in the
cirrhotic liver with these morphological changes is
supposed. The increase in IgA levels is more difficult
to account for. Part of the circulating IgA is syn￾thesised by plasma cells in the small intestinal
mucosa (Vaerman and Heremans, 1970). It is
unlikely that this synthesis can be influenced by
changes in liver morphology. Part of IgA is, however,
produced in the bone-marrow and this part of IgA
may be related to liver morphology. Higher doses of
antigen are required to elicit specific IgA than IgG
responses, but certain increments in antigenic doses
appear to cause a greater rise in the number of
specific IgA antibody producing cells than IgG
producing cells (Benner et al., 1974). In the present
study the relationship between liver morphology and
increased IgA may be related to such critical
increments in antigenic spillover from the liver.
We have in an earlier study shown that the pre￾sence of steatosis also in patients without cirrhosis
increases E. coli antibody levels (Prytz et al., 1973).
That the present study does not demonstrate a
relationship between different degrees of steatosis
and E. coli antibody levels may indicate that the
impact of steatosis on the microcirculation of the
cirrhotic liver is so little that variations in the degree
of steatosis are not reflected in the extraction of
antigen.
