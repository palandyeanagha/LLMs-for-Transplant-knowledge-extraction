THE EFFECT IN PATIENTS OF STREPTOCOCCAL FIBRINOLYSIN
(STREPTOKINASE) AND STREPTOCOCCAL DESOXYRIBO￾NUCLEASE ON FIBRINOUS, PURULENT, AND SAN￾GUINOUS PLEURAL EXUDATIONS'

Medical Division of Bellevue Hospital, New York City)
(Received for publication August 6, 1948)
The results described in this article were ob￾tained by the injection of concentrated and par￾tially purified preparations derived from broth
cultures of hemolytic streptococci into the pleural
cavity of selected patients who were suffering
from different types of diseases that gave rise to
pleural exudations. The possibility has been ex￾plored of utilizing two of the defined properties
elaborated by hemolytic streptococci that have the
unique capacity of causing rapid lysis of the solid
elements (fibrin and nucleoprotein) that are sig￾nificant parts of exudates. In a companion ar￾ticle, Christensen (1) has described additional
steps in the purification of the materials employed
and has given quantitative methods of measure￾ment of various increments concerned in the
fibrinolytic system, including trypsin inhibitor and
specific antibodies, which have been employed in
this study.
In the study of patients it was first necessary
to: (a) develop the investigation within non￾toxic but effective ranges of doses of the material
employed, and (b) determine whether or not the
enzymatic activities of the streptococcal products
were effectively operative when introduced di￾rectly into the site of the disease in the patients.
This article is essentially limited to findings that
are pertinent to the two aspects of the study men￾tioned above.
A brief description of the two streptococcal
products that have been the subject of the in￾vestigation is as follows:
I. Streptococcal fibrinolysin (2) (Strepokinase)
This has been found to be elaborated character￾istically by strains of hemolytic streptococci
(Group A) causing acute infections in patients.
It is also produced by some strains of strepto￾1 This study was supported by a grant from the Na￾tional Institute of Health, United States Public Health
Service.
coccal groups C and G (3). The product is
abundantly excreted into the culture medium in
which the organisms are grown and is readily ob￾tainable free from the bacterial cells in sterile
filtrates.
The fibrinolytic action, in tests conducted un￾der optimal laboratory conditions, is unusually
rapid in action on the fibrin coagulum of normal
human blood, requiring only a few minutes when
whole plasma is employed as a source of fibrin,
and an even shorter time when preparations of
fibrinogen and thrombin of human origin are
used. The ultimate proteolytic nature of the
fibrinolysis has been evident in the liberation of
breakdown products of protein digestion (4).
Another interesting feature of the phenom￾enon is the high degree of activity of the strepto￾coccal lytic system in the presence of normal hu￾man blood as contrasted with its inaction or de￾layed effect when tests are conducted with the
blood of various animal species with the exception
of monkeys (3). Although studies of factors in￾volved in streptococcal fibrinolysis have indicated
a basis for the differences in the behavior of blood
from different animals, nevertheless the existence
of the difference has rendered impossible most
experimental studies, in vivo, on animals and has
limited them to observations conducted in pa￾tients, such as those initially described in this
article.
The mechanism of the reaction has been a sub￾ject of study by various investigators.
In an earlier report (2) it was noted that fibrin
formed from mixtures of either human fibrinogen
and rabbit thrombin, or of rabbit fibrinogen and
human thrombin were susceptible to streptococcal
lysis, whereas the fibrin derived from rabbit
fibrinogen plus rabbit thrombin was unaffected.
Milstone (5) demonstrated that an increment of
human serum present in the euglobulin fraction,
173

WILLIAM S. TILLETT AND SOL SHERRY
was necessary for the reaction to occur and that if
preparations of human fibrinogen and thrombin
were highly purified no lysis would occur when
the streptococcal product was added. Further￾more, if this human globulin fraction was added
to fibrin made up of rabbit components, lysis oc￾curred. He referred to the euglobulin constituent
of human blood as "lysing factor" and suggested
that streptococcal fibrinolysis was mediated by the
same system as that involved in other examples of
fibrinolysis.
Christensen (4), and Christensen and Mac￾Leod (6) have presented results concerning the
mechanism, and have concluded that the strepto￾coccal product to which they have given the name
streptokinase acts as a catalyst or kinase in caus￾ing the transformation of a zymogen of normal
human blood, designated by them plasminogen,
into a proteolytic enzyme, designated plasmin.
Kaplan (7) has made extensive studies on
several aspects of the mechanism of the strepto￾coccal fibrinolysin-serum protease system. These
studies have in part dealt with the dissimilarity
of serum protease and trypsin and also with the
inhibition of streptococcal fibrinolysis by antipro￾tease. The findings are predicated upon the
kinase nature of the action of the streptococcal
product and the identity of the protease of serum
as the lysing principle. Ratnoff (8), studying a
proteolytic enzyme in human plasma, gave special
attention to the fibrinolytic system activated by
the streptococcal product and obtained data indi￾cating that the activation of plasma proteolytic
enzyme by streptococcal fibrinolysin behaved as
if it involved a stoichometric reaction. This
finding implies that the streptococcal product may
take an active part in the lytic system rather than
exert only a catalytic effect.
Without developing the discussion of the mech￾anism, it is sufficient to state that the objective
demonstration of changes in constituents of
pleural exudates that have been effected by the
streptococcal fibrin-dissolving system, acting
within the pleural cavity of patients, constitutes
definitive results around which this report cen￾ters. The conditions, unavoidably inherent in
the several factors that may be simultaneously op￾erative in association with the processes of dis￾ease within patients, makes it impossible at the
present time to analyze and identify the mecha￾nism of fibrinolysis that may be responsible for
the end results that we have observed.
Nomenclature. The fibrinolytic principle de￾rived from hemolytic streptococci is referred to
in this article as streptokinase. The kinase type
of action of the streptococcal product has been
consistently observed by several investigators.
However, whether or not its complete activity
is solely that of kinase remains to be determined.
The term fibrin-lysing system has been employed
as an objectively descriptive expression which
avoids the different recommendations of various
investigators (6, 9-1 1). The activatable fibrin-ly￾sing system may be closely identified with the
plasminogen of Christensen and MacLeod (6),
and the active fibrin-lysing system with their
term plasmin.
II. Streptococcal desoxyribonuclease
In recent articles the occurrence of desoxy￾ribonucleoprotein in significant amounts in puru￾lent empyematous fluids was reported (12) and
its depolymerization by a desoxyribosenuclease
found to be present in the concentrated strepto￾coccal flltrates was also described (13).
The solid sediments of the samples of pus were
found to contain as much as 30% to 70% nucleo￾protein. Since the physical characteristics of
desoxyribose nucleoprotein are fibrous and gel￾atinous, the similarity of its appearance to that
of fibrin became a matter of importance in identi￾fying the dual enzymatic systems with which we
were dealing; namely, fibrin substrate in the
fibrinolytic system, and nucleoprotein substrate
acted upon by nuclease. In each instance rapid
liquefaction of the respective solid substrate
occurred.
Each of the substrates mentioned has been
identified in varying amounts in different types of
pleural exudation. For example, empyemal pus
of bacterial origin is high in its content of nu￾cleoprotein, which is presumably derived from
the leucocytes, while the constituent most con￾spicuously present in hemothorax is fibrin. Fi￾brinous pleural exudates such as may be en￾countered in association with pneumonia, pul￾monary neoplasm, and other diseases, or the ef￾fusions of tuberculous pleurisy have been studied
chiefly for the fibrinolytic effect, although from
174

STREPTOKINASE AND STREPTONUCLEASE EFFECT IN PATIENTS
observations on preparations of the exudates
stained by the Feulgen method (12), it is evi￾dent that varying amounts of nucleoprotein are
present.
Streptococcal concentrates 2
The preparations employed in this study have been pre￾pared by Christensen according to the method of partially
purifying the concentrated filtrates of hemolytic strepto￾cocci previously described and further elaborated in the
accompanying article (1, 14). A strain of hemolytic
streptococcus (H46A) belonging to Lancefield Group C
has been employed. This strain is potent in its produc￾tion of both streptokinase and desoxyribose nuclease (13)
and most of the lots of concentrated filtrate used in this
study have possessed both properties. In addition it
seemed reasonable to assume that since the strain (a
group C) was not of patient origin its products might
presumably be least likely to contain other noxious, but
as yet unidentified, increments associated with acute in￾fections in man and would, therefore, be more desirable
for preparing material to be used in patients than would
a Group A fibrinolytic strain. All the partially purified
and concentrated preparations, with one exception, that
were introduced into patients, contained both streptokinase
and nuclease. In an additional preparation used in a
single patient with hemothorax, the content of nuclease
was reduced substantially by Christensen (1) but the
streptokinase activity remained unimpaired.
The dosage of streptokinase has been based upon a unit,
developed and described in the accompanying article by
Christensen (1). The dosages per patient are given in
the individual protocols. In general they ranged from
20,000 to 400,000 units. The concentration per cubic
centimeter ranged from 2,000 to 40,000 units. The total
dose was usually contained in 10 cc. of normal saline
solution.
The desoxyribonuclease content of the various prepara￾tions of streptococcal concentrates has not yet been elab￾orated so extensively as that of streptokinase. Christensen
(1) has suggested a unit basis which is at present being
employed. In general the concentrates contained a ratio
of approximately 6,000 units of nuclease to 15,000 units
of streptokinase. The nuclease was of special significance
in the cases of empyema, and the dosage is given in the
description of the results obtained in that group.
Toxicity of streptococcal concentrates. Among the in￾itial studies (2) concerned with the characterization of
the streptococcal fibrinolytic phenomenon, preliminary
observations (unpublished) were made with respect to
the skin reactivity of active filtrates derived from strains
of fibrinolytic streptococci. Following intracutaneous in￾jections, areas of local erythema developed that simulated
the type of a positive reaction elicited by the erythrogeriic
scarlatinal toxin. However, by comparative tests in
2Lederle and Co. have cooperated by growing large
volumes of culture and supplying the filtrate in its initial
concentrated form.
which both scarlatinal toxin and fibrinolytic filtrates were
injected into Dick positive and Dick negative individuals,
no correlation was detected. From the limited observa￾tions, it seemed reasonable to assume that the primary
toxicity of the fibrinolytic filtrate was due either to the
fibrinolytic principle itself or to some contaminating prod￾uct other than the established erythrogenic toxin of
hemolytic streptococcal origin.
When the recent concentrates prepared by Christensen
(1) in the process of purifying the streptococcal fibrinoly￾sin were being considered for introduction into patients,
intradermal tests were performed. Although the concen￾tration of streptokinase was increased many hundred-fold
over the preparations of earlier use, the degree and fre￾quency of erythematous reactions were found not to be
any greater than those previously encountered nor to be
related to the concentration.
Samples of the concentrates were then injected intra￾muscularly. No reactions occurred that were detectable
by the development of local redness, tenderness or swell￾ing, or as a generalized pyrogenic effect. When increas￾ingly large concentrations failed to produce untoward
effects intramuscularly, small amounts were introduced
intrapleurally into patients with empyema, inflammatory
pleural effusions, or hydrothorax.
Without describing the details of the progressive ob￾servations following intrapleural injections it may be
stated that as the procedures of purification and concen￾tration conducted by Christensen developed, the evidences
of toxicity have diminished in relationship to amount
injected. The studies have, therefore, up to the present
time indicated that the primary toxicity of the fibrinolytic
principle or the accompanying desoxyribonuclease is not
great and that the transient pyrogenic reaction may be
due particularly to contaminating substances still present
in even the purest preparations now available.
The manifestations of toxicity when they occurred have
consisted of a pyrogenic reaction beginning approximately
six to eight hours after the injection, reaching its peak
of a rise of one to four degrees at 24 hours after injection
and decreasing gradually over the next 24 to 72 hours to
the pre-injection level which in some instances was a
normal temperature and in others was elevated prior to
the injection due to the underlying disease. General
malaise accompanied the febrile period. Nausea and
gastro-intestinal discomfort were noted in some patients.
Local pain, although never severe, was present in some
instances, and not in others.
An outpouring of polymorphonuclear leucocytes oc￾curred which was demonstrable 24 hours after the injec￾tion and decreased to the pre-injection level within the
next two to ten days. The increase in the leucocyte
counts ranged from 1,000 to 25,000 cells per cubic centi￾meter.
The general pyrogenic reaction together with individ￾ual symptoms as mentioned, and the local outpouring of
cellular constituents did not follow any uniform or cor￾related pattern, since all of the manifestations were not
present to the same degree and some of them were
entirely absent. In several instances in which two injec￾175

WILLIAM S. TILLETT AND SOL SHERRY
tions were given, the first may have caused a reaction
while the second elicited no toxic response, or the first
was silent and the second evoked some reaction. Fur￾thermore, the occurrence of reaction was not clearly
related to dosage of concentrate.
In this study a total of 34 injections was given to 23
patients. Utilizing a rise of 1° F in fever as an indi￾cation of a reaction-and irrespective of whether or not
the patient was febrile before the injection-on 17 (50%)
occasions a pyrogenic response was noted.
The degree of reaction appeared to be most directly
related to the nature of the patient's disease. In instances
where considerable thickening of the pleura was present
or other circumstances that may have impaired the ab￾sorbing surface, minimum or no toxic reactions occurred.
In other cases where the contrary situation of a thin
pleura or presumably a relatively freely acting absorbing
surface was present, the reactions as described were more
consistently noted.
Other factors that may participate in the reaction in
a manner as yet undetermined are the breakdown prod￾ucts derived on the one hand from the fibrinogen and
fibrin system and, on the other hand, from the nucleo￾protein system through the action of nuclease. No spe￾cific information on this phase of the subject is available
except the fact that the toxic reaction, whatever its exact
cause may be, was a transient one of the classical brief
pyrogenic type without any residual effects. No indica￾tion of chronic alterations of an untoward nature have
been evident. Because of the implications of hemolytic
streptococci in relation to rheumatic fever and acute
hemorrhagic nephritis, detailed examinations for their
possible presence have been frequently made with uni￾formly negative findings.
It has been of special importance to make preliminary
tests with each new lot of purified concentrates made
available for use in patients by injecting a small amount
intrapleurally and noting the degree of reaction. When
the reaction appeared to be relatively greater than would
be expected from the small dose, the lot was not further
employed in the study of patients. This precautionary
procedure of selecting individual preparations for intra￾pleural use has been regularly adhered to, and, as a result,
no contraindications for the development of the study
have been encountered.
PROCEDURE
Observations on Patients. In the study of patients
numerous quantitative determinations have been made on
samples of exudate obtained prior to the injection of
streptococcal concentrates and at stated intervals there￾after, usually one hour, 24, 48, 72 hours, etc., according to
the nature of the case and the findings.
The tests and procedures employed have included the
following: fibrinogen, N.P.N., total protein, formal titra￾tion, amount of sediment, viscosity, pH, volume of pleural
exudate, free streptokinase, activatable fibrin-lysing sys￾tem, active fibrin-lysing system, trypsin inhibitor, and
specific anti-fibrinolytic antibody (anti-streptokinase).
Cytological studies, including total and differential
counts, determination of motility and viability of cells
and the appearance of Feulgen-stained preparations for
the purpose of identifying- intra- and extracellular de￾soxyribose nucleoprotein have also been made. These
results will be referred to briefly in this article and be
reported in detail in a subsequent communication.
The technical procedures in each instance have been
as follows:
Streptokinase titre, activatable fibrin-lysing system
(equivalent to plasminogen), trypsin inhibitor, and
anti-streptokinase titre were determined on chest fluid
according to the methods described by Christensen (1).
Active fibrin-lysing system (equivalent to plasmin) was
determined as follows: To 0.1 cc. samples of chest
fluid, brought to neutral pH, were added 0.5 cc. of
0.25% Bovine Fibrinogen (Armour) in 0.01 M saline
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 0.5 cc. of 0.25%
Human Plasma Fraction III (Cohn) in saline phos￾phate buffer. One tenth ml. of 1/3 dilution of Lederle
Hemostatic Globulin (or 1/500 dilution of Parke Davis
Bovine thrombin) in saline phosphate buffer was then
rapidly added. The tubes were incubated in a water bath
at 37°. One tenth cc. of saline instead of chest fluid was
used for controls. The time of complete lysis of the
fibrin clot was noted. Since the lysis of fibrin in the
absence of extra increments of streptokinase was rela￾tively slow and, therefore, could not be expressed in
the same unitage scale, the results were expressed as
0-++++ as follows:
lysis up to one hour ++++
lysis one to six hours +++
lysis six to 24 hours ++
lysis 24 to 48 hours +
lysis 48 to 72 hours but no lysis in controls ±
No lysis 0
Estimations of the degree of activity of the fibrin￾lysing system with respect to time have proved impor￾tant since the period required for lysis, in vitro, re￾flected to some degree the activity of the process, in
vivo, which was significant with respect to changes in
the exudates that continued for several days after the
initial injection.
Amount of sediment: Wintrobe hematocrit tubes were
filled to the mark with a heparinized sample of chest
fluid and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for one hour. The
results are expressed as per cent.
pH was determined on separately collected heparinized
samples by glass electrode after chest fluid was allowed
to equilibrate with room temperature. A previously
determined temperature correction for the instrument
used was applied, so that the results are expressed as
pH at 370 C.
Viscosity: The viscosity of thin fluids was determined on
heparinized samples in an Ostwald viscosimeter at
370 C. The viscosity of thick purulent fluids was
determined with an LV model Brookfield electric
viscometer at 370 C.
176

STREPTOKINASE AND STREPTONUCLEASE EFFECT IN PATIENTS
Total protein and N.P.N. were done on the supernatant
of centrifuged oxalated specimens of chest fluid. The
total protein was determined by Kjeldahl digestion and
nesslerization. The N.P.N. was determined by diges￾tion and nesslerization of a trichloracetic acid filtrate.
The results are expressed as milligrams per cent for
N.P.N., and grams per cent for total protein.
Fibrinogen was determined on the supernatant of centri￾fuged oxalated specimens. Five-cc. samples were di￾luted to 30 cc. with normal saline, to which were added
1 cc. of 2.5%o CaCI, solution and 1 cc. of a 1/100 dilu￾tion in normal saline of Parke, Davis Bovine Thrombin.
The tubes were then placed in the refrigerator over￾night. The clots were removed with a stirring rod,
washed with distilled water, and the nitrogen deter￾mined by digestion and nesslerization. The results are
expressed as milligrams per cent.
Formol titration: Ten-cc. samples of heparinized fluid
were brought to pH 7.0 by addition of either 0.1 N
NaOH or 0.1 N HCl. Five cc. of 40% formaldehyde
were added, and the mixture titrated with standard
0.1 N NaOH by glass electrode to pH 8.6. The vol￾ume of alkali necessary to bring 5 cc. of 40% formalde￾hyde to pH 8.6 was subtracted from the titration. The
results are expressed as cubic centimeters of 0.1 N
NaOH per 100 cc. of chest fluid.
Volume of pleural fluid: Since information concerning
the volume of pleural effusions was desirable, the fol￾lowing method was developed. The fluid volume was
determined in pleural transudates and non-purulent
exudates by injecting known quantities of T-1824 and
sampling the pleural fluid from 15 to 60 minutes there￾after. This method is not applicable to purulent em￾pyemas where a significant portion of the dye is bound
to the sediment of the fluids and probably to the shaggy
pleural surface, but quantitative determinations on non￾purulent pleural effusions have yielded satisfactory
results.
RESULTS
Twenty-three patients have been studied fol￾lowing the injection of amounts of streptococ￾cal concentrates sufficiently large to bring
about definitive and measurable biochemical and
biophysical changes in the area of exudation at the
site of the injection. Although the general plan
of study has been the same in all instances the
presentation of the results has been arranged ac￾cording to a grouping of the cases based on the
types of exudates which were present in the
pleural cavities of the patients. The changes that
have been effected by the concentrates have been
found to bear a relationship to the character of
the exudates.
The three major groups were: acute fibrinous
pleurisy, bacterial empyema, and hemothorax.3
Group I. Acute fibrinous pleurisy, 13 patients.
Five cases of tuberculous pleurisy with effusion.
Six cases of primary or metastatic malignant
pulmonary neoplasm with pleural effusion.
Two cases of congestive heart failure with
pleural effusion.
Figure 1 contains data derived from serial de￾terminations of fibrinogen and nonprotein nitro￾gen made on seven patients before and after the
introduction of streptococcal concentrate. The
dosages, given in the figure, ranged from 20,000
to 200,000 units of streptokinase, and approxi￾mately 20 to 200 units/cc. chest fluid. Three of
the patients received a second injection.
The fibrinogen represents the chief parent pro￾tein (plus an undetermined amount of solid
fibrin) that was acted upon by the fibrin-lysing
system, and the N.P.N. represents the end-prod￾uct of the local proteolysis.
The findings in each of the seven patients dem￾onstrate the rapidity of the beginning decrease
in measurable fibrinogen and increase in N.P.N.,
the samples taken as early as one hour after the
injection revealing changes in the values of each.
In patient W. H., for example, the immediate drop
in fibrinogen was from 41 to 20 mgm.%, and in
patient J. G., from 108 to 26 mgm.%o. The con￾comitant rise in N.P.N. in patient W. H. was
from 45 to 52 mgm.%o, and in patient J. G., from
31 to 41 mgm.%o.
In five of the seven patients of the charted
group, a further drop in fibrinogen was noted in
the specimen obtained 24 hours after the injection,
and in each of the seven the N.P.N. either con￾tinued to rise or maintained a higher level than
that of the pre-injection figures.
Three of the patients received a second injec￾tion of streptococcal concentrate; patient C. L. re￾ceived 100,000 units of streptokinase four days
later, patient E. H. received 40,000 units of strep￾tokinase three days later, and patient J. G. re￾ceived 200,000 units of streptokinase three days
later. In each case there was a further abrupt

decrease in fibrinogen and rise in N.P.N. follow￾ing the second injection.
In five cases in which the fibrinogen content was
followed for long periods of time by examining
samples of pleural fluid obtained at repeated in￾tervals, the levels of fibrinogen were found to re￾turn to the control value only after ten days to
one month. Why the fibrinogen remained low
for this period of time is not readily apparent.
Continuing lytic action during this period was not
evident by the measurements of the active fibrin￾lysing system employed. Furthermore, the fibri￾nogen levels remained low despite the appearance
of antistreptokinase, and was independent of the
reappearance of additional increments of the ac￾tivatable fibrin-lysing system through further exu￾dation of serum into the pleural area. It may

additional fibrinogen to occur into the area of
pleurisy, or slow proteolysis may have continued
but at a rate not determinable by our present
methods.
There were in the patients several uncontrolla￾ble factors that altered the serial findings as they
extended over several days. For example, when
the patient's disease was in an acute active state,
there was a continuing increase in the effusion to￾gether with the inflammatory constituents. When
the disease was stationary or subsiding, the con￾tents of the pleural cavity were not substantially
altered during the period of observation. In ad￾dition, the variable degree of local irritation
caused either by the injection material itself or
the breakdown products of proteolysis contributed

an additional increment of exudate. Further￾more, the rate of absorption of the newly formed
non-protein nitrogen proceeded at variable rates.
Consequently, the figures obtained by analysis of
the exudate were only relative with respect to
total proteolysis.
In spite, however, of the variables outlined
above, the intrapleural degradation of fibrinogen
in significant amounts following each injection of
the streptococcal concentrates has uniformly oc￾curred in each of the patients in this series, as
well as in those of the other groups. The extent
to which solid preformed fibrin underwent lysis
was not measurable but its breakdown undoubtedly
contributed to the N.P.N. that was liberated.
In some of the patients, estimations of blood
N.P.N. were done but no significant rise above
normal levels was noted, the rate of absorption
from the pleural area being insufficient to raise the
content of the general circulation.
The data contained in Figure 2 concern three
elements involved in the streptococcal fibrin-lysing
system, namely: free streptokinase, and both the
activatable and the active fibrin-lysing system.
They are recorded for five patients of the acute
fibrinous pleurisy group. Similar findings were
obtained from most of the patients studied of
all the groups.
Prior to injection the amount of activatable
fibrin-lysing system present in the pleural exudate
was approximately the same as that found in
normal serum but within one hour after the in￾jection of streptokinase striking changes occurred
in the elements of the fibrin-lysing system of the
pleural exudate. When streptokinase was intro￾duced, the activatable elements of the lytic sys￾tem were replaced by active increments which
were demonstrable immediately following injec￾tion but progressively disappeared during the
next 24 to 48 hours. This implies that once the
system assumes the active form it is subsequently
destroyed, or disappears through combination
with substrate. Its replenishment must await,
through further exudation from the general cir￾culation into the local area, the addition of new
components of the activatable system which were
rapidly depleted following the introduction of
streptokinase. The rate at which the replenish￾ment occurred has depended upon factors that
control the reformation of exudate. In the series
of cases used in this study, it has been demon￾strable within a few days. These findings indi￾FIG. 3. THE

to which it may be dissipated by combining di￾rectly with substrate, or by inactivation by some
inhibitor, or by neutralization with specific anti￾body is not at present determined. Also suggested
by the data in Figure 2 is the finding of active
fibrin-lysing elements only in the presence of
free streptokinase. This observation may have
a bearing on the mechanism of the phenomenon
as it occurs in exudates and will be given further
study. However, once the activatable system has
been depleted, new increments of free strepto￾kinase alone produce very little new active fibrin￾lysing elements.
The development of specific antifibrinolytic an￾tibodies following acute streptococcal infections
has been previously demonstrated (15, 16). That
the injection intrapleurally of streptococcal con￾centrates containing streptokinase also evokes the
specific antistreptokinase response has been men￾tioned by Christensen (1), and was observed in
connection with the earlier injections which were
made primarily to estimate degrees of toxicity.
In Figure 3 evidence is presented from five
cases of the development of antistreptokinase anti￾bodies that were demonstrable in pleural exudates
and followed intrapleural injections of streptococ￾cal concentrates.
The rise in titre in the exudates occurred be￾tween the sixth and 11th days and was noted si￾multaneously in the serum.
The exact significance of the presence of spe￾cific antibody in nullifying the action of the
fibrin-lysing system in local areas is not at pres￾ent clearly established. Subsequent reference will
be made to this point in connection with patient
A. M. of Figures 7 and 8.
Figure 4 is presented for the purpose of demon￾strating the total findings with respect to their
correlation obtained serially in a single patient.
In addition to the data described in Figure 1
(fibrinogen and N.P.N.) and Figure 2 (activa￾table fibrin-lysing system, active fibrin-lysing sys￾tem, and free streptokinase) and Figure 3 (spe￾cific antistreptokinase), measurements of total
protein and formol titratable substances are in￾cluded.
The patient, J. G., had acute fibrinous pleurisy
of tuberculous origin which had been active for
ten weeks when first studied. He received two in￾jections of streptococcal concentrate, the first con￾training 100,000 units and the second, three days
later, containing 200,000 units of streptokinase.
The individual findings are comparable to
those presented in Figures 1 to 3 and they dem￾onstrate the rising and falling changes previously
described. The fibrinogen drops and the N.P.N.
rises; the activatable fibrin-lysing system drops
as it is rapidly transformed into the active fibrin￾lysing system which attacks the fibrinogen and the
local deposit of fibrin; antistreptokinase being
evident in increased titre in the exudate on the
11th day.
The total proteins have exhibited no quantita￾tive changes. They have been determined in
grams rather than milligrams as has been the case
with fiArinogen. This is in agreement with
Christensen's findings (unpublished) of little or
no in vitro digestion of serum albumins or globu￾lins.
The formol titrations which have risen coin￾cident with the rise in N.P.N. after each injec￾tion were of the same magnitude and probably
represent further evidence of the intrapleural
breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin.
The findings in the case of patient J. G. of
Figure 4 are similar to those obtained in each
of the other cases of Group I. In addition to the
results noted in Figures 1 to 4, the following ob￾servations have been noted in this group of pa￾tients. The pH of the chest fluids fell significantly
(0.2 to 0.3 units) in 24 hours after the injec￾tion of the streptococcal concentrate, slowly re￾turning to the control values, and has been con￾sidered as part of the phenomenon of increased
proteolysis. Small but significant falls in viscosity
were noted, which are consistent with the break￾down of the long eccentric fibrinogen molecules
and depolymerization of any small amounts of
desoxyribosenucleic acid that may be present.
Twenty-four to 48 hours after injection, the sedi￾ment increased from 0.5% to 2.0%, then slowly
decreased over the next two to ten days to the
control levels. This appeared to be directly re￾lated to the increased cellular content occurring
in the pleural fluids in association with the local
irritation. As noted earlier, no significant changes
in the amount of trypsin inhibitor were found in
the samples of pleural fluid. Finally, the values
for activatable fibrin-lysing system, trypsin in￾hibitor and antistreptokinase were found to agree

closely for both chest fluid and serum prior to the
injection of streptococcal concentrates. The de￾crease noted in the activatable fibrin-lysing system
after streptokinase injections occurred only locally
since no changes in this value occurred in the serum
at any time. Antibody changes, however, as pre￾viously described, were evident simultaneously
both locally and in the general circulation.
Group II. Cases of bacterial empyema, Eight
patients.
Four cases of mixed infections associated with
tuberculous empyema and bronchopleural
fistula.
One case of empyema due to Friedlander's
bacillus.
One case of pneumococcal (Type XVII)
empyema.
One case of post-pneumonic empyema (sterile).
One case of empyema due to anaerobic strep￾tococcus.
Interesting differences were observed between
the constituents of purulent empyemal fluid and
those of acute fibrinous pleurisy. For example,
fibrinogen has not been found to be present in
the purulent material aspirated before the in￾jection of the concentrates. The supernatant por￾tion of centrifuged specimens failed to produce
coagulum when thrombin was added. It seems
probable that the formation of fibrin had previ￾ously occurred to a considerable degree at the
site of infection and depleted the exudate of its
fibrinogen.
In the empyemal group, the presence of de￾soxyribose nucleoprotein as a significant portion
of the granular sediment was regularly noted,
and, as previously reported (12), constituted from
30% to 70% of the total solids. In addition, al￾though not recorded in detail in this article, prep￾arations stained by the Feulgen method have re￾vealed the presence of nucleoprotein occurring
extracellularly as fibrous reticulum, granules, and
amorphous plaques.
In Figure 5 comprehensive data are presented
concerning one of the patients with empyema.
The patient, T. H., had chronic pulmonary tu￾berculosis, with a left bronchopleural fistula,
draining thoracotomy, and a mixed empyema.
After aspirating a sample of pus, streptococcal
concentrate containing approximately 160,000
units of desoxyribonuclease and 400,000 units of
streptokinase in 10 cc. of saline were injected.
The rapid and extensive liquefaction of the nu￾cleoprotein by the desoxyribonuclease was demon￾strated by the marked fall in viscosity from 150 X
water to 3 x water and decrease in measurable
sediment from 70%c to 23% in one hour. These
quantitative changes persisted over the 24 hours
of sampling. Subsequent drainage of the em￾pyema was temporarily facilitated following the
liquefying changes. However, the lysing pro￾cedure was not continued and consequently the
clinical value was not extensively tested.

STREPTOKINASE AND STREPTONUCLEASE EFFECT IN PATIENTS
Definite increases in N.P.N. and formol titra￾table material were also observed. One hour
following the injection the free streptokinase
titre was 640 units/cc., and subsequently fell to
10 units/cc. in 24 hours. As in the cases pre￾viously described, the active fibrin-lysing system
appeared but to a less degree than in the fibrinous
pleuritic group.
Even though the above data indicate some de￾gree of activity of the fibrinolytic system, the find￾ings in this patient demonstrate the significant ac￾tion of the streptococcal desoxyribonuclease.
The changes in the physical character of the
empyemal pus are strikingly illustrated in the
photographs shown in Figure 6. The amount of
lysis of sediment that occurred at the site of infec￾tion within the patient's thorax is evident and it
was to the greatest degree due to the depolymeri￾zation of the nucleoprotein of the pus by the nu￾clease contained in the concentrate that was in￾troduced.
Similar findings were obtained in six of the
eight cases of empyema. One of them is worthy
of further mention. The patient, T. P., entered
the hospital with acute lobar pneumonia of four
days' duration. He was treated with penicillin
but his course and X-ray were suggestive of
empyema. Aspiration of the chest performed on
the tenth day of hospitalization yielded only a
few cubic centimeters of thick green fluid which
was sterile on culture. Introduction of air intra￾pleurally revealed the presence of several locu￾lations within the empyemal cavity. Ten days
later, 50 cc. of thick greenish pleural fluid was
withdrawn and streptococcal concentrate con￾taining approximately 40,000 units of desoxyri￾bose nuclease and 100,000 units of streptokinase
in 10 cc. of saline was introduced into the site of
aspiration. Examination of specimens of fluid ob￾tained by subsequent repeated aspirations revealed
that the viscosity of the pus fell from 38 x water
to 14 x water in one hour, and to 5 X water in 24
hours. The sediment decreased from 35%So to 14%
in one hour, and to 10% in 24 hours. The N.P.N.
rose from 58 mgm.% to 73 mgm.% in one hour,
and to 84 mgm.% in 24 hours. Twenty-four
hours after the injection 465 cc. of thin greenish￾grey fluid was removed with ease. An X-ray of
the chest at this time revealed that the latest as￾piration had effected almost complete drainage of
the empyemal cavity and that the previous evi￾dence of loculation had disappeared. Following
this tap, the temperature fell rapidly to normal,
the leucocytosis disappeared within a few days,
and the patient made an excellent clinical re￾covery.
In one case of mixed empyema and in the one
due to Friedlander's bacillus infection, the pHs of
the fluids were found to be very acidic (5.50, and
5.21) apparently due to extensive proteolysis and
digestion (N.P.N.'s 184, and 400) that had oc￾curred spontaneously as a result of the diseases
themselves. The injected streptococcal concen￾trate had no effect due to the low pH since stud￾ies, in vitro, have shown that both streptokinase
and desoxyribonuclease are rapidly inactivated at
this pH.-
In cytological studies of the sediment of exu￾dates, both of the acute fibrinous and the purulent
groups, one feature of special interest has been
the consistent breaking up of clumps of white
blood cells. This change has been evident in the
contrast between the cells of the pre-injection
specimen and those of the sample obtained one
hour after the introduction of the streptococcal
concentrate. Whether or not the clumping was
due to the fact that the cells were made ad￾herent by a coating of fibrin or fibrous nucleo￾protein is not yet established. However, since
the concentrates contained both streptokinase and
nuclease a final explanation of the cellular effect
awaits further study. As mentioned previously
a detailed report of the cytological studies will be
the subject of an early communication.
From the results obtained in the observations
on the empyemal cases there is ample evidence
that nucleoprotein depolymerization and probably
fibrinolysis occurred, the former by the extensive
decrease in the nucleoprotein sediment and fall
in viscosity, the latter by changes in the fibrin￾lysing system and changes in the N.P.N. and
formol titration.

WILLIAM S. TILLETT AND SOL SHERRY
The multilocular condition had been transformed
into a unilocular state. It seems likely that the
fibrinolytic system was chiefly operative.
It is of special interest to note that this patient
had a high titre of antifibrinolysin (antistrepto￾kinase) at the beginning of the study. Although
not proved by cultures it seems likely that he had
previously had one or more infections with hemo￾lytic streptococci since the height of antibody titre
is consonant with that previously found in patients
convalescent from known infection with hemolytic
streptococci.
In spite of the presence of immune bodies, how￾ever, impairment of the action of the streptococcal
product was not apparent. It is not possible at the
present time to offer an explanation of these find￾ings. However, the possibilities suggest them￾selves either that a sufficient amount of strepto￾kinase was injected to bind with antibody and
leave an excess, or that the active lysing system
was put in operation before the antibody took
effect. Further study of this phase of the prob￾lem is required. Also evident from the data, as
in the results with the previous cases, is the fall
in the activatable fibrin-lysing system coincident
with the appearance of an active fibrin-lysing sys￾tem, and its slow return toward the control value.
Trypsin inhibitor did not change despite the ac￾tivation and rapid inactivation of the fibrin-lysing
system.
The course in the patient just described ap￾pears to represent an example of a beneficial
therapeutic result effected by the action of the
streptococcal fibrin-lysing system.
The second patient with postoperative hemo￾thorax will be referred to only briefly since he
is still under observation. Thirty-two days post￾operatively the patient was transferred to our
Service because it was impossible to obtain more
than a few cubic centimeters of fluid from the
postoperative side of the thorax. X-ray examina￾tion revealed a large shadow with fluid levels oc￾cupying approximately one-half of the thoracic
cavity. From three aspirations at different sites
a total of 3 cc. was obtained. Into each of the
sites streptokinase was injected up to a total of
250,000 units. In the preparation of concentrate
employed in this case almost all of the nuclease
had been eliminated. Consequently only the fibrin￾olytic system was operative to any significant
degree. Twenty-four hours later 600 cc. of thin
brownish fluid were removed by thoracentesis
from a single site without difficulty. Immediately
after the aspiration, by fluoroscopy and X-ray,
only a small amount of effusion remained. Al￾though fluid reaccumulated over the next few
days, successful aspirations were readily performed
indicating a considerable reduction in the pres￾ence of loculation, and the creation of a favorable
situation for further intercostal drainage.
DISCUSSION
A group of unique enzymatic activities have
been utilized to produce changes in fibrinous,
purulent and sanguinous exudations within the
pleural cavities of patients. Thus through the
mediation of substances elaborated by hemolytic
streptococci, fibrin is caused to undergo lysis;
fibrinogen is altered so that it no longer can as￾sume the solid form of fibrin; and the coarse sedi￾ment of purulent exudate (primarily desoxyribose
nuceloprotein) is degraded to a thin solution..
Once it had been well established by detailed
preliminary observations that the methods of
purification of the streptococcal products devel￾oped extensively by Christensen (1) yielded
preparations that were progressively less toxic,
although maintaining constant or increased po￾tency, a demonstration of the occurrence and de￾gree of action in patients of the active principles￾streptokinase and desoxyribose nuclease-be￾came a center of interest. For this purpose quan￾titative estimations were made of the results of
the action of each enzymatic system on its re￾spective substrate in the areas of disease. The
rapidity of the beginning of action, and the dura￾tion of continuing action after a single, and in
some instances after a second injection, were de￾termined.
Definitive enzymatic changes of a significant
degree were regularly obtained and were demon￾strable within an hour after the injection and en￾dured for several days before the effect sub￾sided and disappeared. The phenomenon was a
self-limiting one following each injection.
The clinical courses of the patients have been
followed by frequent physical, laboratory, and
X-ray examinations over extended periods. Fol￾lowing the injections a febrile response occurred
188

STREPTOKINASE AND STREPTONUCLEASE EFFECT IN PATIENTS
not infrequently and there was also evidence of
local irritation. Both signs of reaction were,
however, transient.
Since the periods, in which the action of the
concentrates was operative, were limited to a few
days, striking evidence of favorable alterations of
a permanent nature was not expected nor defi￾nitely demonstrated except for the results ob￾tained in cases of loculated hemothorax, one ex￾ample of which is described in detail, and in some
of the instances of empyema. In patients with
hemothorax, it is obvious that consideration must
be given to the broad principles and problems of
thoracic surgery before the application of the pro￾cedure may be most advantageously made.
The findings, however, constitute a background
against which the scope of the study is being
broadened to include a consideration of the pos￾sible usefulness of the procedure when utilized
under appropriate circumstances. The desira￾bility of causing the liquefaction of fibrin or of
preventing its formation, or of resolving purulent
nucleoprotein containing sediments, would on
theoretical grounds depend upon a variety of con￾ditions associated with the pathogenesis and ex￾pected evolution of the disease processes to which
this method involving lytic activities might be ap￾plied. Comparable principles would also be ap￾plicable to exudative diseases involving locations
in the body other than the pleural area.
If the solid increments constitute part of an
advantageous walling off process then the lique￾faction of the wall might promote a spread of the
infection in its acute phases before the patients'
immunity was sufficient to restrain the dissemina￾tion of the infection. On the other hand, the same
walling off may prevent the introduction of anti￾bacterial reagents of an immunological nature, as
well as antibiotic substances, into the field of
disease. Under the latter circumstances elimi￾nation of the wall might be advantageous. Other
sets of conditions concern factors that are involved
in the ultimate formation of scar tissue, or of ad￾hesions, and the permanent thickenings that are
related to the final organization of infected areas.
The results presented in this article serve as a
basis for extending the study along the lines that
have been discussed.
SUMMARY
1. Twenty-three patients suffering from exu￾dative pleurisies associated with different types of
diseases have received intrapleural injections of
partially purified concentrates containing strepto￾coccal fibrinolysin (streptokinase) and desoxy￾ribose nuclease.
2. Intrapleural fibrinolytic and proteolytic
changes due to the activity of the fibrin-lysing
system were demonstrable in samples of the exu￾dates taken at repeated intervals after the in￾jection. The effects were self-limiting after each
injection.
Intrapleural depolymerization of the nucleopro￾tein of the solid sediment of the exudates was
also demonstrable in a similar manner.
3. When toxic manifestations occurred follow￾ing the injections, they were limited to transient
febrile reactions with general malaise, and a local
outpouring of leucocytes of a few days' duration.
4. The possibility is discussed of influencing
favorably by the enzymatic systems the course of
exudative types of diseases and it is being given
additional study.
The authors wish to acknowledge the excellence of the
technical assistance which they have received from Miss
Harriet Heffernan, Mr. John Goeller, and Miss Doris
Bitz.
