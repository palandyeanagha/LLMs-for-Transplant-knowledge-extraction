Abstract
Kidneys age at different rates, such that some people show little or no effects of aging whereas others show rapid functional
decline. We sequentially used transcriptional profiling and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping to narrow down
which genes to test for association with kidney aging. We first performed whole-genome transcriptional profiling to find
630 genes that change expression with age in the kidney. Using two methods to detect eQTLs, we found 101 of these age￾regulated genes contain expression-associated SNPs. We tested the eQTLs for association with kidney aging, measured by
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using combined data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the
InCHIANTI study. We found a SNP association (rs1711437 in MMP20) with kidney aging (uncorrected p = 3.661025
, empirical
p = 0.01) that explains 1%–2% of the variance in GFR among individuals. The results of this sequential analysis may provide
the first evidence for a gene association with kidney aging in humans.

Introduction
Aging trajectories vary among individuals. Both the age at
which physiological function begins to decline and the rate of such
decline varies among individuals. The heritability of human
longevity ranges from 0.23–0.26, but little is known about specific
genes that affect the rate of aging or human lifespan [1].
Candidate gene studies have found a few genes in which certain
alleles are enriched in centenarians versus the normal population,
including APOC3 (GeneID 345), IGF1R (GeneID 3480) and
FOXO3A (GeneID 2309) [2–4]. These alleles may promote better
health and contribute toward extended lifespan.
We chose to identify genes that associate with a focused
phenotype of aging rather than the nonspecific phenotype of living
to age 100. Specifically, we examined aging in the kidney, an
organ that shows an objectively quantifiable decline in function
with age. With age, the kidney gets smaller, particularly in the
cortex, and kidney function begins to measurably decline after age
40–50 [5,6]. The glomeruli are ball-shaped structures in the
kidney composed of capillary blood vessels actively involved in the
filtration of the blood to form urine. The rate at which blood is
filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the
overall renal function, is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The
major aging phenotype in the kidney is a 25% decline in GFR
starting at age 40 [7]. Individuals show variable rates of kidney
aging. In one longitudinal study, one third of individuals showed
no decrease in GFR measured over a 20 year period, whereas the
remainder of the population showed a distinct decline [8]. The
heritability of GFR is estimated to be 0.40–0.46 [9,10]. In a
genome-wide association study, single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in three gene regions (UMOD, GeneID 7369; SHROOM3,
GeneID 57619; GATM-SPATA5L1, GeneIDs 2628 and 79029)
were shown to associate with GFR [11].
In genome-wide association studies, hundreds of thousands of
SNPs are tested, thus the penalty for multiple hypothesis testing is
a large obstacle to overcome. A powerful alternative to genome￾wide association studies is genomic convergence, which selects
candidate genes for a specific phenotype based on genome-wide
expression studies [12–17]. Differential expression between cases
and controls may indicate that the gene is functionally involved in

disease pathogenesis. DNA chips can be used to identify gene
expression increases or decreases in affected individuals compared
to controls, and then SNPs within the genes that change
expression can be used as candidates in genetic association studies.
This approach scans the entire genome for expression changes
associated with a disease in order to prioritize genes with a greater
chance of contributing to the disease phenotype. This approach
was first used to identify genes associated with Parkinson’s disease,
schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease [12–17].
In this study, we have extended the genomic convergence
approach to find genes associated with kidney aging by adding an
eQTL analysis after the initial genome-wide transcriptional
analysis. If a gene is functionally involved in kidney aging and if
DNA differences in the gene cause variation in expression among
individuals, then there may be an association between the specific
allele carried by an individual and that individual’s physiological
aging trajectory. Finally, we tested the set of eQTLs for association
with kidney aging in two studies of normal aging, the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging and the InCHIANTI study. Using
this sequential approach, we were able to find SNPs in the matrix
metallopeptidase gene MMP20 (GeneID 9313) that are signifi￾cantly associated with kidney aging.
Results
Selection of Age-Regulated Genes
We used a sequential method involving transcriptional profiling,
eQTL mapping and gene association to identify genes that may
contribute to kidney aging. We determined which genes change
expression with age in the kidney because these are likely enriched
for genes that affect physiological aging. For example, a gene that
decreases expression with age may contribute to poor renal
function because it is expressed at levels below a physiological
threshold in the elderly. We obtained a set of 447 age-regulated
genes from a genome-wide transcriptional profile of aging in the
human kidney [18]. In addition, a previous gene set enrichment
analysis identified four genetic pathways that were coordinately
age-regulated in each of three human tissues (kidney, muscle and
brain). These pathways include 152 extracellular matrix genes, 85
ribosomal genes, 35 chloride transport genes and 95 electron
transport chain genes [19]. We combined the age-regulated genes
with the age-regulated pathways and obtained a set of 630 genes
that change expression with age.
Identification of eQTLs by Total Expression Analysis
If age-regulated genes are important for kidney function, then
variation in gene expression may correlate with kidney function. We
focused on finding expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) using two
methods. The first method searched for eQTLs by pooling
individuals that have the same genotype for a particular SNP, and
then determining whether the different SNP genotypes are
associated with average expression of the corresponding gene. We
selected 1041 SNPs in the promoter regions and 386 SNPs in the
coding and untranslated regions of the 630 age-regulated genes. We
then used a custom Illumina GoldenGate assay to genotype these
SNPs in 96 kidney samples (Table S1). Total expression data for
these 96 samples was obtained from whole-genome microarrays of
69 kidneys from Rodwell et al. (2004) and new expression data from
26 kidney samples. Kidney samples were from normal tissue from
patients aged 29 to 92 years. The kidney samples were dissected into
cortex (94 samples) and medulla (59 samples). Expression levels of
each gene in the genome were determined using Affymetrix HG￾U133A and HG-U133B microarrays.
We compared the genotypes from our chosen SNPs to their
corresponding gene expression levels and found 16 SNPs in 12
genes associated with total expression level (Linear Regression,
p,0.001, Table S2). Four of the genes have two significant SNPs; in
two cases, the SNPs are in different linkage disequilibrium blocks
indicating that the eSNPs are independent, and in two cases, the
SNPs are linked to each other (r2
.0.8 HapMap CEU population)
and thus represent only one significant association [20].
One promoter region SNP that showed strong association with
total expression is rs705704, which is 274 base pairs upstream of
the transcription start site of ribosomal protein S26 (RPS26,
p = 1.2610220, Figure 1A). Individuals with the AA genotype have
the highest expression, heterozygotes have medium expression,
and GG homozygotes have the lowest expression of RPS26
(GeneID 6231). RPS26 has been identified as an eQTL in other
studies (Figure 1B) [21–25].

Author Summary
Although family studies have shown that genes play a role
in longevity, it has proven difficult to identify the specific
genetic variants involved. We developed a sequential
transcriptional profiling and eQTL mapping approach to
find genes associated with aging in the kidney. First, we
used genome-wide transcriptional profiling to determine
which genes change expression with age in kidney tissue.
Next, we used two methods to determine which of these
age-regulated genes contain SNPs that associate with
expression level. The allele-specific expression method,
which compares the mRNA levels of the two alleles within
heterozygous individuals, was more sensitive than the
total expression method. We tested the eQTLs for
association with kidney aging in two populations. One
gene that encodes an extracellular matrix protein, MMP20,
significantly associated with kidney aging, providing the
first gene association with kidney aging. Our approach of
combining both expression and genotype data can be
applied to any phenotype of interest to increase the power
to find genetic associations.

Identification of eQTLs by Allele-Specific Expression
Analysis
The second method identified differential allelic expression
within individuals that are heterozygous for a specific SNP. In this
method, the expression levels of each allele are measured directly
by assaying SNPs within the mRNA transcript. Heterozygotes
were examined for allelic transcript levels that differ from each
other, using genomic DNA allelic ratios as a control of 1:1
hybridization intensity. Because differential expression is examined
within heterozygotes, mRNA levels are measured within the same
genetic background and cellular environment.
Allele-specific expression analysis was used to test all of the age￾regulated genes that had SNPs in their mRNAs. We assayed the
relative expression levels of 386 mRNA SNPs in 276 age-regulated
genes in 96 individuals. Most of the mRNA SNPs were in the 39
untranslated regions of genes (249), some were in coding regions
(115), and a few were in the 59 untranslated regions (22).
Oligonucleotides specific for each allele of each SNP were
designed for use in the Illumina GoldenGate multiplex PCR assay.
Kidney cortex mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA prior to
the start of the GoldenGate assay. In the assay, the PCR products
for each allele were labeled with a different fluorophore and the
intensities of each allele were compared to determine if one allele
was expressed higher than the other. The cDNA allelic intensities
for each SNP were compared within heterozygotes to test for
differential allelic expression. Because the intensities from each
fluorophore (Cy3 and Cy5) can differ, the genomic DNA allelic
intensities of heterozygotes were used as a control to define a 1:1
allelic ratio for each SNP. The cDNA allelic ratio for each
heterozygote was compared to the 95% confidence interval
surrounding the mean genomic DNA allele intensity ratio for
each SNP. At least five heterozygotes were tested per SNP. If the
cDNA allele intensity ratio for more than 50% of individual
heterozygotes fell outside the 95% confidence interval and the
combined p-value was less than 1026
, the SNP was considered to
be an eSNP.
In total, 105 eSNPs in 93 age-regulated genes were detected
(Table S3, Figure 2). The median fold-change of the higher
expressed allele to the lower-expressed allele was 2.1. The level of
overexpression of one allele varied widely among genes, from 1.4-
fold to apparent monoallelic (.10-fold) expression (Table S3).
Two genes (SPP1, GeneID 6696 and TIMP3, GeneID 7078) had
linked eSNPs (r2
.0.8 HapMap CEU population) that both
showed allele-specific differences in expression. Ten genes
contained two eSNPs that independently showed differences in
expression.
For most of these eSNPs (96/105), the higher-expressed allele
was usually the same across heterozygotes. For example, the A
allele is expressed higher than the C allele in 11 of 12
heterozygotes tested at rs2245803 in the gene matrix metallopro￾teinase 20 (MMP20, Figure 3A), and the G allele is expressed
higher than the A allele in 14 of 15 heterozygotes tested at rs8643
in TXNDC5 (GeneID 81567, Figure 3B). In these SNPs, the
functional SNP causing the expression difference is likely linked to
the SNP we measured. For a smaller subset of the SNPs (9/105
eSNPs), both alleles were observed at a higher level in different
heterozygotes. One explanation for this is that the functional SNP
causing the expression difference is not closely linked to the SNP
we measured in the transcript. Another explanation is that
epigenetic effects such as imprinting could cause the differences in
expression from the two homologs. For example, one of the genes
in which either allele was associated with higher expression is
PEG3 (GeneID 5178, paternally expressed 3), which is known to be
imprinted [26,27]. Presumably, the higher-expressed allele in our
studies is from the paternal homolog.
386 SNPs were tested for association with expression by both
the allele-specific method and the total expression method. While
105 eSNPs were identified by the allele-specific method, only five
eSNPs were identified by the total expression method. Of the five
SNPs found by the total expression method, four were also found
by the allele-specific expression method (Bold in Table S3). One
example is rs8643 in the gene TXNDC5, in which both methods
found that the G allele is associated with higher expression than
the A allele (Figure 3B and 3C). These results indicate that the
allele-specific assay identified many more eSNPs and is likely more
sensitive in detecting expression differences than the total
expression assay. A probable reason is that for the allele specific
assay, expression is measured from two alleles in heterozygotes and
thus variability due to genetic background and environmental
effects are reduced or eliminated.
Genetic Association with Kidney Aging
Our sequential experimental approach identified 101 genes that
show age-related changes in expression in the kidney and that also
contain eSNPs, indicating a presence of functional polymorphisms.
We used these eQTLs as candidates in a gene association study of
normal kidney aging. We genotyped a total of 2038 SNPs within
these 101 genes (Table S4) in two different cohorts selected to
study normal aging. In these studies, the function of the kidney was
measured by GFR using 24-hour creatinine clearance. The first
cohort is the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA),
which is a long-running study of human aging begun in 1958 [28].
This study has enlisted over 3000 healthy volunteers from the
Baltimore area for clinical evaluations of many age-related traits
and diseases [29]. GFR was measured at multiple ages for each
individual, with an average of 3–4 measurements per individual
taken at different times spanning decades. Thus, this study shows
Figure 2. Distribution of allele-specific expression. The white
bars show the distribution of the allelic expression ratio for all
heterozygotes that express the transcript of the 309 SNPs tested. The
red bars show the distribution of the allelic expression ratio for
heterozygotes that show allele-specific expression.

not only the average level of kidney function with respect to age,
but also shows the age-related downward trend in kidney function
for each individual. Multiple GFR measurements and genotype
data were available for 1066 participants.
The second cohort is the InCHIANTI study, which is a
population-based epidemiological study aimed at measuring factors
important for aging in the older population living in the Chianti
region of Tuscany, Italy [30]. About 90% of the elderly from two
towns participated in this study, making it an exceptionally useful
source to study genetic determinants of normal aging. GFR
measurements were performed at one age in 1130 individuals.
Characteristics of both cohorts are shown in Table 1.
We used regression models that included age as a covariate to
test the SNP genotypes in each population for association with
GFR (See Methods). In order for an allelic association with GFR
to be considered significant, we first required evidence of
association in both populations (p,0.05 in each population). A
total of 13 genes contained SNPs that met these criteria (Table 2).
Next, we combined these p-values using Fisher’s meta analysis, a
method for combining p-values from independent tests with the
same overall hypothesis [31]. To correct for multiple hypothesis
testing, we performed 1000 permutations of each model by
swapping identification labels and keeping the genotypes together
to preserve linkage disequilibrium (See Methods). Two linked
SNPs (rs1711437 and rs1784418) in matrix metalloproteinase 20
(MMP20) remained significant after permutation testing (uncor￾rected p,561025
, corrected p = 0.01).
We considered whether associations found in the BLSA cohort
could have been due to population structure. Concern for population
structure was minimal in the InCHIANTI cohort because it is a
homogeneous Italian population. Most of the BLSA cohort is made of
Caucasian individuals (84%). Our mixed-effect regression model
included a covariate for self-reported race, which should control for
differences due to population structure. In addition, we found that
rs1711437 in MMP20 showed an association with kidney aging using
only data from self-reported Caucasians in the BLSA cohort
(uncorrected p = 0.0010). These results indicate that the MMP20
SNPs associate with kidney aging per se, and are not artifacts arising
from genetic differences between races.
A SNP in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene (IGF1R)
was strongly associated with GFR when taking age into account in
the meta-analysis (rs11630259, p = 7.861025
, Table 2). Decreased
activity of this gene has been associated with longer lifespan in
model organisms and humans [3,32,33]. However, SNPs in IGF1R
did not remain significant following permutation testing. There￾fore, further studies are required to establish a connection between
this SNP and kidney aging.
In both populations, one or two copies of the A allele at
rs1711437 in MMP20 associated with a higher GFR (Figure 4).
For an individual who carries the A allele, his or her creatinine
clearance is approximately that of someone 4–5 years younger
who does not carry the A allele. In the BLSA population, the
genotype of rs1711437 explains 2.1% of the variation in creatinine
clearance and in the InCHIANTI population, the genotype
explains 0.9% of the variation. Similar results were found for the
second SNP rs1784418, which is in linkage disequilibrium with
rs1711437.
Both rs1711437 and rs1784418 are associated with variation in
kidney aging, but the functional SNP is not known. The eSNP
rs2245803 identified by allele-specific expression analysis is not
linked to rs1711437 and rs1784418 (Figure 5). Thus, some other

SNP in this linkage disequilibrium block, such as a coding SNP or
a different eSNP, may cause differences in activity of MMP20 and
be responsible for association with the kidney aging phenotype.
Interestingly, two nonsynonymous coding SNPs, rs1784424
(Asn281Thr) and rs1784423 (Ala275Val) are contained within
this linkage disequilibrium block (Figure 5). These amino acid
differences might affect MMP20 function and these coding
changes may be causal for differences in kidney aging among
individuals.
Discussion
The goal of our approach was to converge on genes that
influence human kidney aging through sequential genomic
analyses. We began with a genome-wide transcriptional profile
of aging in the human kidney, which gave an unbiased view of
gene expression changes that occur with age [18]. Then, we used
total expression analysis and allele-specific expression analysis to
determine which alleles are differentially expressed. We identified
101 age-regulated eQTLs. SNPs in one of these genes, MMP20,
showed a statistically significant association with normal kidney
aging. Although significant by combining the data from two
independent populations, the best way to confirm our gene
association with renal aging is to replicate the findings in
additional populations.
The populations used to identify aging SNPs, BLSA and
InCHIANTI, stand out for their usefulness in studying normal
kidney aging. Both of these studies were purposefully designed to
study healthy individuals, instead of those harboring diseases
associated with old age. The BLSA study includes longitudinal

measurements of traits associated with normal aging, which added
considerable power to the analysis.
Two SNPs in MMP20 significantly associated with age￾related decline in GFR of the kidney. Matrix metalloproteinases
are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal
physiological processes, such as embryonic development,
reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease
processes, such as arthritis and metastasis [34,35]. Matrix
metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix proteins in￾cluding laminin, elastin, proteoglycans, fibronectin, and colla￾gens [36]. A role for MMP20 in renal function has not been
described before, although previous studies show that MMP20
plays an important role in tooth development [37]. The finding
that a matrix metalloproteinase is involved in kidney aging is
striking because changes in the extracellular matrix play a key
role in aging of the kidney. The glomerular basement
membrane thickens, and the mesangial matrix increases in
volume with age [38]. Interstitial fibrosis occurs during aging
because of an increase in matrix and fibrillar collagen
accumulation in the subintimal space [39].
MMP20 was included in our candidate aging gene set not
because the gene itself is significantly age-regulated in the kidney.
Instead, MMP20 was included because it is a component of the
extracellular matrix, one of the pathways that coordinately
increased expression with age in three human tissues including
the kidney [19]. Therefore, polymorphisms in MMP20 may not
only associate with aging of the kidney, but may associate with
phenotypes of aging in other tissues as well. Additionally, if
MMP20 is a common regulator of aging, certain alleles may also
be enriched in centenarians.
The second-highest scoring gene in our kidney aging association
study is the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Although the
SNP in this gene did not reach statistical significance in this study,
this result is interesting because this gene is part of the insulin-like
signaling pathway that has been shown in be involved in aging in
worms, flies and mice [40]. Specifically, reduced signaling in this
pathway results in longer lifespans for these model organisms. In
worms, the orthologous gene is called daf-2 (GeneID 175410), and
daf-2 mutants can have lifespans that are 100% longer than wild￾type worms [33]. In humans, rare variants in the IGF1R gene in
centenarians are associated with reduced IGF1R levels and
defective IGF signaling [3].
Sequential use of transcriptional profiling and eQTL mapping
could be used as a general method to increase the statistical power
for any human gene association study. Like candidate gene
approaches, an advantage of our approach to identify variants
associated with kidney aging is that it increases the statistical power
of the gene association study by decreasing the number of SNPs
that are tested to potentially functional SNPs. An advantage of our
sequential approach over a candidate gene approach is that the
entire genome was screened for genes that are age-regulated in the
first step.
Several groups have used DNA microarrays to measure gene
expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and have found polymor￾phisms that associate with expression level [21,23,41–47]. In a
total expression analysis of human brain cortical tissue, 21% of
genes have SNPs that associate with expression levels [22]. Other
groups have used the allele-specific expression approach to identify
differentially-expressed genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines [48–51],
brain [52], white blood cells [53], fetal kidney and fetal liver [54].
These studies found that 20–50% of the genes in the genome are
differentially expressed. Sixteen of the genes showing allele-specific
expression found by our study were also found in previous studies
(Table S5) [50,53–55]. Thus, 77 of the 93 allele-specifically
expressed genes identified in this work represent novel findings.
Our finding that 41% of tested genes showed allele-specific
expression is similar to the percentage found in previous studies
[48–54].
Of the expression-associated SNPs we identified, most were
found using allele-specific expression measurements within
heterozygotes. Specifically, 41% of genes assayed contained
eSNPs using the allele-specific expression method, whereas only
2% of genes assayed contained eSNPs using the total expression
method. The statistical cutoff for finding eSNPs using the allele￾specific method was more stringent than the one used for the total
expression method. Thus, our results may underestimate the
improved sensitivity of the allele-specific method over the total
expression method.
Unlike the total expression method, the allele-specific method
examines alleles within the same cellular environment in
heterozygous individuals. This maximizes the sensitivity of the
assay because the alleles are expressed from the same environment
and genetic background. Previous work with a smaller set of 64
genes also showed that allele-specific analysis in heterozygotes was
more sensitive than total expression methods for finding SNPs
associated with expression levels in cis [48]. The results from the
allele-specific analysis demonstrate that differential expression is
widespread across the human genome and suggest that differential
expression could be a major factor contributing to differences in
phenotype among individuals. As the Genotype-Tissue Expression
(GTEx) project [56] moves forward, it will be important to

consider allele-specific expression data to maximize sensitivity to
detect differential expression.
Finding new human aging genes, possibly MMP20, contributes
to our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the
human aging process. Among young individuals, an unfavorable
SNP genotype may indicate risk for rapid decline in kidney
function and this information could be extremely useful to identify
patients who may require early intervention. Among older
individuals, a favorable SNP genotype may indicate that they
may still be eligible as kidney donors even though they are over the
current upper age limit. As more aging genes are confirmed, the
alleles belonging to a patient can be combined to better predict the
aging trajectory of the kidney.
Methods
Ethics Statement
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Stanford
University Institutional Review Board (IRB). All subjects provided
written informed consent for the collection of samples and
subsequent analysis. This study was conducted according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Stanford Kidney Samples
Normal kidney tissue was obtained from Stanford University
Medical Center with informed consent either from biopsies of
kidneys from transplantation donors or from nephrectomy patients
with localized pathology. Kidney tissue from nephrectomy patients
was harvested meticulously with the intention of gathering normal
tissue uninvolved by the tumor. Samples that showed evidence of
pathological involvement or in which there was only tissue in close
proximity to the tumor were not used. Kidney sections were
immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at 280uC until use.
RNA and DNA Preparation
Frozen kidney samples were weighed (25–50 mg), cut into small
pieces on dry ice, and then placed in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) for RNA
extraction or 600 ml of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen, Valencia,
California, United States) for DNA extraction. The tissue was
homogenized using a PowerGen700 homogenizer (Fisher Scien￾tific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States). Total RNA was
isolated according to the TRIzol Reagent protocol and genomic
DNA was isolated according to the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA
Mini Kit protocol.
SNP Selection
Candidate aging genes were chosen from previous transcrip￾tional profiling studies and include 447 age-regulated kidney
genes [18] as well as the genes in the four pathways that are
commonly age-regulated in the kidney, muscle and brain:
extracellular matrix, ribosome, chloride transport and electron
transport chain [19]. The candidate kidney aging genes were first
searched for mRNA SNPs that could be used in an allele-specific
expression assay. In addition to being within the transcript on an
autosome, the SNPs had to have a minor allele frequency greater
than 0.05 in the HapMap CEU population, an Illumina SNP
score greater than 0.4, and be greater than 30 bp from an exon
boundary (NCBI Build 36.1) to ensure the Illumina genotyping
assay would work properly for both genomic DNA and cDNA.
For genes that had multiple assayable mRNA SNPs, those closest
to the 59 end of the gene were chosen, with a maximum of two
SNPs per gene. These criteria were met for 386 SNPs in 276
genes. For candidate aging genes that did not have an
appropriate mRNA SNP, promoter region (defined as 5 kb
upstream or downstream of the transcription start site) SNPs
meeting the same minor allele frequency (.0.05) and SNP score
(.0.4) criteria were chosen. One to four SNPs were chosen per
gene for analysis, totaling 1041 promoter SNPs in 354 candidate
aging genes.
Genotyping
The candidate aging SNPs were genotyped using a GoldenGate
Custom Panel from Illumina (San Diego, California, United
States). Oligonucleotides specific for each allele of each SNP were
designed for use in a multiplex PCR. A standard protocol designed
by Illumina and implemented at the Stanford Human Genome
Center was used to determine the genotypes of the 96 individuals
for whom we had kidney tissue. Samples were hybridized to
custom Sentrix Array Matrices and scanned on the Illumina
BeadStation 500GX. Allele calls were determined using the
Illumina BeadStudio clustering software. The genotyping was
successful (.90% call rate, HWE p.0.001) at 1341/1427 of the
SNP loci in 599/630 genes (95%). The 1341 SNPs are listed in
Table S1.
Total Expression Quantification
Most of the microarrays (68 cortex and 59 medulla samples)
used in our total expression association study were previously
analyzed [18]. The same Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California,
United States) HG-U133A and HG-U133B high-density oligonu￾cleotide arrays used in Rodwell et al. were used here to measure
total expression levels in 26 additional cortex samples. The
samples were processed at the Stanford Genome Technology
Center using their standard protocol [18]. Eight micrograms of
total RNA was used to synthesize cRNA for each sample, and
15 mg of cRNA was hybridized to each microarray. Using the
dChip program [57], microarray data (.cel files) were normalized
according to the stable invariant set, and gene expression values
were calculated using a perfect match model. All arrays passed the
quality controls set by dChip. The raw microarray data are
available at the Stanford Microarray Database (http://smd.
stanford.edu).
Ancestry Analysis
Because our kidney tissue samples were from individuals living
in the diverse San Francisco Bay Area, we needed to control for
population structure. Most of the individuals in our study self
reported their ancestry (84/96). Genetic clustering analysis has
been shown to highly correlate with self-identified ancestry [58].
To determine the ancestry of the 12 unknown individuals, we used
the clustering program STRUCTURE [59]. We used the
genotypes of 839 unlinked SNPs from our 96 samples and from
the CEU, YRI, and JPT+CHB HapMap populations in our
analysis. Using the STRUCTURE admixture model, we deter￾mined our Stanford samples cluster with the greatest probability
into three populations, each clustering with one of the HapMap
populations. Because most of the Stanford samples were
predominantly of Caucasian genetic ancestry and because it is
simplest to use a Boolean covariate value in regression analysis
when chronological significance of the state (genetic ancestry in
this case) is unknown, we chose to divide the individuals into two
groups. In the first group we included individuals with an average
percent CEU ancestry .75%. This group included 72 individuals.
The second group contained the other 24 individuals. The 84 self￾reported ancestries matched the ancestries calculated with
STRUCTURE.

Total Expression Regression Models
We used a linear regression model to determine which SNP
genotypes showed a statistically significant association with gene
total expression levels:
Yij~b0jzb1jgijzb2jageizb3jtizb4jancizb5jsizeij ð1Þ
In equation 1, Yij is the base 2 logarithm of the expression level for
the gene of SNP j in kidney sample i, gij is the genotype (0,1,2 for
AA, AB, BB) of individual i at SNP j, agei is the age in years of the
individual i, ti is 0 if sample i was from kidney cortex and 1 if
sample i was from kidney medulla, anci is 0 if the individual
contributing sample i has .75% CEU ancestry and 1 for other
ancestry proportions, si is 0 for males and 1 for females, and eij is a
random error term. The coefficients bkj for k = 0–5 were estimated
by least squares from the data. Our primary interest was b1j values
that significantly differed from zero, indicating that SNP j
associates with total expression level. Because our microarrays
were processed on two different scanners three years apart, we
analyzed the two sets of data separately. The first set comprised
the 127 samples previously analyzed in Rodwell et al. and the
second set comprised the 26 additional samples processed here.
We combined the results from the two regression analyses using
Fisher’s combined probability test [31]. The b1j p-values from each
of the two analyses were combined into one test statistic (x2
)
having a chi-square distribution and four degrees of freedom using
the formula:
x2
~{2
X2
i~1
logeðÞ ð pi 2Þ
Using Fisher’s method, we found 11 promoter SNPs in seven
genes and five mRNA SNPs in five genes that associated with total
expression level (p,0.001).
Allele-Specific Expression Quantification
Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California, United States). The same Illumina
GoldenGate Custom Panel used for genotyping was used to
measure cDNA levels according to which allele of the SNP is
present in the transcript. Only SNPs for which the DNA
genotyping was successful were analyzed. After the cDNA PCR
products were hybridized and scanned, the raw allelic
intensities were first used to determine which transcripts were
expressed. The expression threshold was defined by the absent
allele in normal homozygotes. That is, for an AA genotype, the
intensity of the B allele was taken to be background. The
expression threshold was calculated for each SNP as the mean
of the background intensity plus two standard deviations. SNPs
with five or more heterozygotes showing expression of at least
one of the two alleles were carried through the rest of the
analysis. Of the SNPs measured, 309 of them in 225 genes were
genotyped correctly (call rate.90%, HWE p.0.001) and
expressed above a background threshold in at least 5
heterozygotes. To determine which alleles were associated with
expression level, a confidence interval was calculated for each
SNP using the DNA allele intensities of heterozygotes. The
confidence interval for each SNP was defined as the mean of the
normalized DNA allele A/B raw intensity ratios plus or minus
two standard deviations. If the cDNA allele intensity ratio for
more than 50% of individual heterozygotes fell outside the 95%
confidence interval and the meta p-value [31] was less than
1026
, the SNP was considered to be an eSNP. eSNPs were not
observed simply due to low, noisy transcript levels because the
relative abundance of each gene in the total cDNA sample
(calculated from whole-genome microarray data) was greater
than the relative abundance of the gene in the genomic DNA
sample.
BLSA Samples
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is an
intramural research program within the National Institute on
Aging [28]. Healthy volunteers aged 18 and older were enrolled in
the study starting in 1958. BLSA participants are predominantly
Caucasian, community-residing volunteers who tend to be well￾educated, with above-average income and access to medical care.
These subjects visit the Gerontology Research Center at regular
intervals for two days of medical, physiological, and psychological
testing. Each participant has a health evaluation by a health
provider (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant).
Currently, the study population has 1450 active participants, aged
18–97 years (http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/blsa/blsa.
htm). The level of kidney function in the participants has been
measured longitudinally in each individual between 1 and 16 times
over a 10 to 50 year time period. The kidney aging phenotype of
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by calculating
creatinine clearance. Specifically, serum creatinine and 24-hour
urinary creatinine levels were obtained from participants using
standard clinical procedures [60], and were used to calculate
creatinine clearance as follows:
CCr~ UCr|VU
PCr|1440 ð3Þ
where CCr is creatinine clearance in ml/min, UCr is urinary
creatinine concentration, VU is the volume of urine collected over
24 hours, PCr is the plasma concentration of creatinine, and 1440
is the number of minutes in 24 hours. We were granted access to
genotype and GFR data for 1066 individuals. The genotype data
comprised the 2038 SNPs genotyped on the Illumina Human￾Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip that are within the 101 genes that
contain SNP associations with expression and have minor allele
frequencies .0.01 (Table S4). The GFR data included 3672
creatinine clearance measurements.
InCHIANTI Samples
The participants in the InCHIANTI study consist of residents of
two small towns in Tuscany, Italy [30]. The study includes 1320
participants (age range 20–102 yrs), who were randomly selected
from the population registry of Greve in Chianti (population
11,709) and Bagno a Ripoli (population 4,704) starting in 1998
[30]. Over 90% of the population that were over the age of 65
participated in this study, and thus the cohort is a good
representation of normal aging (http://www.inchiantistudy.net).
GFR was calculated using creatinine clearance from 24-hour
urine collection as in the BLSA study. In this study, the
measurement for creatinine clearance was performed at one age
only. The genotype data generated by HumanHap550 Genotyp￾ing BeadChip consisted of the same 2038 SNPs in 101 candidate
aging genes obtained from the BLSA (Table S4). The sample size
was 1130 individuals.
Glomerular Filtration Rate Regression Models
Due to the longitudinal nature of the BLSA data, we used a
mixed-effect regression analysis to search for SNP associations
eQTLs and Kidney Aging
PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 8 October 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e1000685

with creatinine clearance. Because the creatinine clearance
measurements within one subject over time are correlated, the
regression coefficients are allowed to vary between individuals.
First, we developed the following model using a likelihood ratio
approach to explain how creatinine clearance changes with time:
Yia~b0izb1iaizb2ia2
i zb3idiazb4id2
i zb5isizb6irizeia ð4Þ
In equation 4, Yia is the creatinine clearance of subject i at age a, ai
is the age of subject i, dia is the date in decimal years of the visit of
subject i at age a, si is the sex of subject i, ri is the self-reported race
of subject i, and eia is a random error term. Most of the data points
(84%) came from self-reported Caucasian individuals. These
individuals were coded 0 for the ri term and everyone else was
coded 1. The coefficients bki of each subject i for k = 0–6 were
estimated by maximum likelihood from the data using the ‘‘lmer’’
function from the ‘‘lme4’’ package of R version 2.8.0. Next, to
determine if the genotype of any of our candidate aging genes can
account for some of the variance in creatinine clearance, we added
two terms to the model:
Yia~b0ijzb1ijaizb2ija2
i zb3ijdiazb4ijd2
i zb5ijsi
zb6ijrizb7ijgijzb8ij gij|ai
 zeija
ð5Þ
In equation 5, gij is the genotype of SNP j in subject i. We
obtained estimates for three different inheritance models:
additive, recessive and dominant. In the additive model g is 0,
1, or 2 for homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozy￾gous recessive genotypes, respectively. In the recessive model, g
is 0 for the homozygous dominant and heterozygous genotypes
and g is 1 for the homozygous recessive genotype. In the
dominant model, g is 0 for the homozygous dominant genotype
and g is 1 for the heterozygous and homozygous recessive
genotypes. For each SNP and each inheritance model, we
compared the results from equation 5 to the results from
equation 4 using a likelihood ratio test to generate a p-value for
each SNP. Even though we included a self-reported race term in
our models, we also confirmed the rs1711437 association with
GFR by analyzing only the data points from Caucasian
individuals (p = 0.0010).
For the InCHIANTI data, we used a simple linear regression
model because the data are not longitudinal to search for SNP
associations with creatinine clearance. We tested the three
inheritance models for SNP association with creatinine clearance
at every age (equation 6) and for SNP association with the rate of
creatinine clearance decline with age (equation 7):
Yi~b0jzb1jgijzb2jaizb3jsizeij ð6Þ
Yi~b0jzb1jgijzb2jaizb3j gij|ai
 zb4jsizeij ð7Þ
In equations 6 and 7, Yi is the creatinine clearance of subject i, gij is
the genotype of subject i at SNP j, ai is the age of subject i, si is the
sex of subject i, and eij is a random error term. The coefficients
were estimated by least squares from the data. In equation 6, our
primary interest was b1j values that significantly differed from zero,
indicating that SNP j associates with creatinine clearance at every
age. In equation 7, our primary interest was b3j values that
significantly differed from zero, indicating that SNP j associates
with the rate of creatinine clearance decline with age.
Testing for Evidence of SNP Association with GFR in Both
Datasets
In order to be confident of a SNP association with GFR, we
required the SNP to show evidence of association in both the
BLSA and InCHIANTI populations. That is, we combined the p￾values from the BLSA and InCHIANTI data using Fisher’s
method (equation 2) only if the individual p-values for a particular
SNP and inheritance model in each population were both less than
0.05. We used the p-value from the likelihood ratio test for the
BLSA data and the p-value from the b1j estimate from equation 6
or the b3j estimate from equation 7 for the InCHIANTI data to
calculate the meta p-value.
Permutation Analysis
To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we performed
permutations to test how often our results could appear by
chance. We resampled the data for each population and each
model 1000 times, keeping the genotypes together, but swapping
the sample labels. The creatinine clearance, age, date and sex
information remained together, but the 2011 SNP genotypes
connected to each individual were changed in each permutation.
Therefore, only the phenotype-genotype relationship was altered
by permutation, the linkage disequilibrium patterns between SNPs
remained the same. For each permutation, we calculated Fisher’s
meta p-values only when both individual p-values from each
population were less than 0.05, as we did in the observed data.
Then, for each model, we determined how many of the
permutations met or exceeded the number of SNPs we found in
the observed data at meta p-value thresholds. The permuted p￾value was the number of permutations that met these criteria
divided by 1000. Permuted p-values less than 0.05 were
considered significant.
