Hope for haemophilic patients with hepatitis
The high incidence of hepatitis after treatment with large
pool clotting factor concentrates was first reported by
Kasper and Kipnis in 1972.' However, there was an initial
gross underestimate of its prevalence because most cases
of acute and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB) were
asymptomatic. Two prospective studies showed that
virtually 100% of patients who received clotting factor
concentrate for the first time, developed NANB hepatitis
- which has now been identified as hepatitis C (HCV).2 3
The scale of HCV infection among people with
haemophilia is large. In the UK it has been the practice
since 1977 to register all treatment administered nationally
at a registry based at Oxford, and it has been established
that, in 1994, there were at least 3122 patients living who
had been infused with large pool clotting factor concen￾trate and thereby infected with HCV between 1977 (when
records began) and 1985 (when sterilisation of concen￾trates began).4
The ultimate treatment for liver failure is liver trans￾plantation. As this is clearly a treatment option, an under￾standing of the natural history of chronic HCV infection
in haemophilia is required to direct the appropriate
resources in the future.
In a cohort of 183 haemophilic patients where the data
of first infusion with large pool clotting factor concentrate
(and hence HCV infection) was known, the Kaplan-Meier
progression to liver failure at 20 years was 1 1% (confidence
intervals 14-18%).5 On average, patients with haemophilia
were infected in 1978 (range 1965-85). Thus, we are only
now seeing the beginnings of the impact of the epidemic.
Furthermore, as yet, progression to liver failure is much
more common in people co-infected with HIV and HCV
- using a Cox proportional hazards model, the relative
hazard of developing liver failure after HIV infection is 21
times. Indeed, in the study by Telfer,5 10 of 11 patients
who developed liver failure were co-infected: the remaining
patient who was HIV negative, was a chronic alcoholic. All
people who became infected with HIV from clotting factor
concentrate must also been infected with HCV - either
with the same infusion or before. Thus in the UK, the 50%
survivors among those with HIV infection (1227 subjects)
must have co-infection and be at risk of developing liver
failure. Thus conversely, in a cohort of HIV infected
patients, 1 0% of deaths have been in liver failure.6
The paper by McCarthy et al in this issue reports a
further four liver transplantations to those already in the
literature, approximately nine in number.7-"l These
experiences have identified some of the features of liver
transplantation that are peculiar to haemophilia.
In the past, perioperative therapy with clotting factor
concentrate has been by bolus injection: twice daily for
factor VIII, which has a half life of 12 hours and less
frequently for factor IX, which has a half life of 16-20
hours. However, experience is now considerable for the use
of constant infusion to maintain levels at 100%, particularly
for factor VIII replacement. This was used for patients 1
and 3 in the reported study. The issues are complex because
of concern of 'sticking' of the clotting factor to plastic
tubing and pump driven syringes, as well as induction of
inhibitors to factor VIII. Thus, treaters are cautious.
However, there are tremendous advantages to constant
infusion - maintenance of a clotting factor at 100% without
peaks and troughs, as well as cutting the cost by one third.
(For a 70 kg man with severe haemophilia A, factor VIII
<2 U/dl requires 3500 U twice daily - about £1000 twice
daily).
Of course, one of the great advantages of liver
transplantation in haemophilia is phenotypic cure - the
ultimate in 'gene therapy'. Thus in this series, the clotting
factor levels were substantially increased in all four patients
by 12 hours post transplantation. In the series reported by
Bontempo et al one patient showed increase in the clotting
factor at six hours. This also means that the operation of
liver transplantation is far less daunting: both from the
reduced bleeding risk and the cost of clotting factor
concentrate compared with other surgery for the
haemophilic patient.
The most difficult issue in the management of such
patients is co-infection with HIV, and it is these patients
who are predominantly presenting currently. Patient 3 in
this series was infected with HIV and successfully trans￾planted: however, it may be significant that his immunity
was well preserved with CD4+ at 300/pil. Perhaps co￾infected people should be considered at an earlier state of
liver compromise than those with HCV infection alone.
Patients with HIV infection can now expect increased
survival, particularly with a large array of anti-HIV viral
therapy becoming available. It is of note that patient 3 had
not been treated with interferon 'because he was infected
with HIV'. Although the response to interferon in HIV
infected subjects is poor, it should be considered,
particularly for type III HCV where it may be possible to
clear the virus (unpublished data).
Thus, it is likely that liver transplantation will become
more common in the management and treatment of end
stage HCV disease in haemophilia. The cost-benefit is
obvious: the failing liver results in multi clotting deficit in
a patient with a single inherited coagulation deficiency and
potential bleeding varices - after transplantation, the
haemophilia is cured and the liver functions. Even if the
patient has HIV infection and the transplant becomes
infected with HCV, he can expect a much better quality
of life, as well as saving perhaps £30 000 a year in clotting
factor concentrate.
