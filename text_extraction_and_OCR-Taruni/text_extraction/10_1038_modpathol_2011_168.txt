Immunofluorescence detection of the complement split product C4d along peritubular capillaries in renal
allograft biopsies is the mainstay for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. The extent of peritubular
capillary C4d positivity may have significant clinical ramifications; however, peritubular capillary density in
the renal cortex is often difficult to assess with single-channel immunofluorescence. In this study,
we report a C4d/CD34 double-immunofluorescence staining protocol for renal allograft frozen sections
that allows rapid and sensitive detection of C4d positivity, as well as improved accuracy in estimating the
C4d-positive fraction of peritubular capillaries. In addition, this method aids in determining whether
C4d-positive structures correspond to peritubular capillaries or whether they represent common mimics of
peritubular capillaries such as tubular basement membranes. C4d/CD34 double immunofluorescence provides
rapid, convenient, and low-cost implementation for laboratories currently utilizing single-channel C4d
immunofluorescence.

Positive immunostaining for the complement split
product C4d within peritubular capillaries is critical
for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection in
renal allograft biopsies. Diffuse C4d positivity,
defined as 450% peritubular capillary involve￾ment, is highly correlated to the presence of
circulating donor-specific antibodies and is required
by the Banff 07 Classification of Renal Allograft
Pathology for the diagnosis of acute and chronic
antibody-mediated rejection.1 However, the clinical
significance of focal (o50%) peritubular capillary
C4d positivity remains unclear. Some studies
suggest that even focal C4d staining may have
significant clinical ramifications, while other
studies fail to show such outcomes.2–5 Nevertheless,
the data are limited and further evaluation with
regard to long-term graft survival is needed.
In order to make any headway into tackling this
issue, a reliable method for assessing the extent of
C4d-positive peritubular capillaries is essential.
Currently, indirect immunofluorescence staining
with anti-C4d antibody on frozen sections of fresh/
unfixed tissues is the most widely used method and
offers slightly higher sensitivity than immunohisto￾chemical stains.6–8 Although the fraction of C4d￾positive peritubular capillaries can be visually
estimated using this method, it is not uncommon
to come across situations where single-channel C4d
immunofluorescence is extremely difficult to inter￾pret. This obstacle is especially evident in biopsies
with significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy where the density of peritubular capillaries
is uncertain. Furthermore, positive C4d signal in
other structures, such as tubular basement mem￾branes, may mimic peritubular capillaries. There￾fore, an accurate and reproducible method for
assessing the percentage of peritubular capillary
C4d positivity is greatly needed.
In this study, we improve on single-channel C4d
immunofluorescence by using C4d in combination
with the vascular endothelial marker CD34 to
implement a C4d/CD34 double-immunofluorescence Received 25 March 2011; revised 7 September 2011; accepted 7

staining protocol for frozen tissue. This method
of dual-channel immunofluorescence evaluation
not only allows for rapid and sensitive detection
of C4d positivity in renal allograft biopsies,
but it also provides improved accuracy when
assessing the extent of C4d-positive peritubular
capillaries.
Materials and methods
Seventeen renal allograft biopsies with positive
peritubular capillary C4d staining, as determined
by single-channel C4d immunofluorescence on
frozen sections, were used for the study. The
biopsies were chosen to represent a range of positive
C4d intensities and extent of peritubular capillary
staining as reported previously in the diagnostic
pathology report. Four renal allograft biopsies
negative for C4d immunofluorescence were used as
negative controls.
Four-micrometer-thick frozen sections of the
biopsies were fixed in acetone for 5 min at 20 1C
and incubated with a mixture of polyclonal
rabbit anti-C4d (ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA) and
mouse monoclonal anti-CD34 (DAKO, Carpinteria,
CA, USA) antibodies for 60 min at a dilution of
1:50 and 1:100, respectively. Subsequently, the
slides were incubated with a mixture of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit
(Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) and Texas Red￾labeled horse anti-mouse (Vector) antibodies for
30 min. Both secondary antibodies were used at
a dilution of 1:100. All incubations were performed
in a humidified chamber in the dark at room
temperature.
C4d/CD34 double-immunofluorescence frozen
section slides were visually examined under
immunofluorescence microscopy using an Olympus
BX41 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Center
Valley, PA, USA), and digital images were captured
using an attached Olympus DP71 digital camera
with the  20 objective. Multiple non-overlapping
fields were captured in order to provide full cover￾age of the entire biopsy tissue. For each field, two
images were captured, one using a green filter for
FITC fluorescence and one using a red filter for
Texas Red fluorescence. The digital images were
saved as 24-bit RGB TIFF files with a final resolution
of 2040  1536 pixels. These files were imported
into the freely available image processing computer
program ImageJ, converted to 8-bit grayscale images,
and background subtraction was performed using a
‘rolling ball radius’ of 50 pixels and with the ‘sliding
parabaloid’ function set to on (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, http://imagej.nih.
gov/ij/). Next, glomeruli and large vessels were
manually masked. Subsequently, a pixel intensity
threshold was automatically set using the built-in
‘moments’ thresholding method. Finally, each pro￾cessed image for the C4d/FITC green channel along
with its corresponding CD34/Texas Red channel was
imported into the ImageJ plugin Just Another
Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) to calculate Manders
coefficient M2.9
Results
Visual examination of C4d/CD34 double-immuno￾fluorescence sections revealed excellent signal with
low background in both channels. These sections
exhibited comparable C4d intensities as sections
stained for C4d alone (Table 1). The CD34 immu￾nostain highlighted peritubular capillaries and
allowed determination of overall peritubular capil￾lary density. This channel also provided a basis of
comparison for estimating the percentage of C4d￾positive peritubular capillaries.
A common diagnostic dilemma encountered in
routine single channel C4d immunofluorescence is
differentiating between positive signals in tubular
basement membranes versus dilated peritubular
capillaries. C4d/CD34 double immunofluorescence
helps resolve this problem. Positive C4d staining
in tubular basement membranes does not co￾localize with CD34-positive peritubular capillaries,
while co-localization of the C4d and CD34 signals
indicates peritubular capillary C4d positivity
(Figure 1a).
Consistent with single-channel C4d immunofluor￾escence results, several of the biopsies exhibited
focal C4d positivity on C4d/CD34 double immuno￾fluorescence (Figure 1b). The percentage of C4d￾positive peritubular capillary was visually estimated
for each case using C4d/CD34 double immunofluo￾rescence and compared with the results from single￾channel C4d immunofluorescence. In most cases,
estimated peritubular capillary C4d extent was
comparable for the two methods; however, a few
cases showed dramatic differences (Table 1). The
disagreement arose from inaccurate assessment of
overall peritubular capillary density with single￾channel C4d immunofluorescence. With the aid of
the CD34 channel, accuracy for the extent of
peritubular capillary C4d staining by visual estima￾tion was improved. Of note, the extent of peritubular
capillary C4d staining demonstrated no correlation
with the degree of chronicity (interstitial fibrosis
and tubular atrophy) or concurrent pathology seen
in the corresponding paraffin-embedded tissue for
each case (Table 1).
As C4d/CD34 double immunofluorescence exhi￾bits strong signal with low background, computer￾assisted morphometric analysis to calculate the
extent of C4d positivity in peritubular capillaries is
also applicable. Using the freely available image
analysis program ImageJ, the green and red channel
immunofluorescence images corresponding to the
C4d and CD34 immunostains, respectively, were
processed, overlaid, and the Manders coefficients
(M2) were calculated (Figure 2 and Table 1).

M2 represents the fraction of CD34-positive pixels
that overlap/co-localize with C4d-positive pixels
and ranges from 0 to 1. A high M2 value indicates
substantial co-localization of the two channels,
whereas lower M2 values represent a lesser
degree of co-localization. M2 values determined
from morphometric evaluation correlated well with
visual evaluation of C4d/CD34 double-immuno￾fluorescence-stained sections (Figure 3).
Discussion
Standard single-channel C4d immunofluorescence
on frozen sections has inherent disadvantages that
limit accurate assessment of positive signal in
peritubular capillaries. Apparent ‘focal’ staining
using this standard method likely constitutes one
of two situations: (1) true focal staining in which
only a portion of the peritubular capillaries show
C4d positivity or (2) diffuse peritubular capillary
C4d positivity with focal loss of peritubular capil￾laries in the renal cortex. Distinguishing between
these two possibilities is especially difficult when
the distribution of peritubular capillary density is
uncertain, as is often the case in biopsies with
tubulointerstitial chronicity. In addition, positive
signal in dilated peritubular capillaries and tubular
basement membranes often mimic one another,
further complicating the interpretation of single￾channel C4d immunofluorescence results. The
implementation of concurrent CD34 immunostain
offers a simple solution to these problems by
highlighting the peritubular capillaries within the
renal parenchyma and establishing a basis of
comparison for C4d-positive structures.
A simple computer-assisted morphometric quan￾titation protocol can be applied to the images
captured from the C4d and CD34 immunofluores￾cence channels to calculate the fraction of C4d and
CD34 co-localization. Our results indicate that M2
calculated by the JACoP plugin for ImageJ is
comparable to visual estimation; however, M2 is
generally slightly lower than the expected fraction
of C4d/CD34 co-localization based on visual assess￾ment. The reason for this difference is that this
program uses a pixel-to-pixel comparison between
the two channels when determining the degree of
co-localization. Minor signal bleed into adjacent
pixels on brighter stains can contribute to slight
pixel non-overlap between channels, resulting in
lower M2. However, M2 shows excellent correlation
to visual estimation and may provide a more
consistent and reproducible quantitative method

for assessing the fraction of positive C4d peritubular
capillaries.
In summary, C4d/CD34 double immunofluores￾cence is a useful yet low-cost and convenient
method for C4d detection in renal allograft biopsies.
It requires minimal optimization and no additional
staining time. The CD34 antibody is simply mixed
with the C4d antibody, as are the secondary
fluorophore-labeled antibodies for each channel.
Thus, laboratories currently using single-channel
C4d immunofluorescence can easily implement this
technique.
