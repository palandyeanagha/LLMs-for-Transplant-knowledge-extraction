Abstract
Background: Chronic cough affects more than 70 percent of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and
causes significant morbidity. Gastroesophageal reflux is the cause of some cases of chronic cough; and also has a
postulated role in the aetiology of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. A high prevalence of acid; and more recently
non-acid, reflux has been observed in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis cohorts. Therefore, gastroesophageal reflux may
be implicated in the pathogenesis of cough in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
Methods: Eighteen subjects with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis underwent 24-hour oesophageal impedance and
cough count monitoring after the careful exclusion of causes of chronic cough other than gastroesophageal reflux.
All 18 were then treated with high dose acid suppression therapies. Fourteen subjects underwent repeat 24-hour
oesophageal impedance and cough count monitoring after eight weeks.
Results: Total reflux and acid reflux frequencies were within the normal range in the majority of this cohort. The
frequencies of non-acid and proximal reflux events were above the normal range. Following high dose acid
suppression therapy there was a significant decrease in the number of acid reflux events (p = 0.02), but an increase
in the number of non-acid reflux events (p = 0.01). There was no change in cough frequency (p = 0.70).
Conclusions: This study confirms that non-acid reflux is prevalent; and that proximal oesophageal reflux occurs in
the majority, of subjects with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. It is the first study to investigate the effect of acid
suppression therapy on gastroesophageal reflux and cough in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The
observation that cough frequency does not improve despite verifiable reductions in oesophageal acid exposure
challenges the role of acid reflux in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis associated cough. The finding that non-acid reflux
is increased following the use of acid suppression therapies cautions against the widespread use of acid suppression in
patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis given the potential role for non-acid reflux in the pathogenesis of cough
and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis itself.
Study registration: The study was registered with the Cardiff and Vale University Local Health Board Research and
Development Committee (09/CMC/4619) and the South East Wales Ethics Committee (09/WSE04/57).

Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fibrotic
interstitial lung disease of unknown origin associated with
the histological and/or radiological pattern of usual inter￾stitial pneumonia [1]. It typically presents with progressive
breathlessness and more than 70% of patients also com￾plain of a persistent, troublesome cough, which is resistant
to conventional antitussive therapy [2]. Cough is an airway
defence mechanism which is mediated via vagal sensory
nerves that are mainly located within the central and prox￾imal airways [3]. It is therefore interesting that cough
should be such a prominent symptom in IPF which pre￾dominantly affects peripheral lung parenchyma. A recent
study using 24-hour cough monitors has shown that pa￾tients with IPF have higher cough counts than both normal
controls and asthmatics; and that the cough counts correl￾ate well with subjective assessments of cough [4]. It has
also been demonstrated that cough has a significant, detri￾mental effect on quality of life in patients with IPF [5].
The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of IPF
remain unknown. However, one hypothesis proposes that
chronic aspiration of gastric contents may cause repeated
injury to alveolar epithelium resulting in the pathological
abnormalities of usual interstitial pneumonia [6]. This hy￾pothesis has recently received support from studies using
24-hour oesophageal pH monitoring and oesophageal
manometry. The largest of these found that 87% of pa￾tients with IPF had abnormal acid gastroesophageal reflux
(GOR) which was often clinically silent and occurred des￾pite treatment with acid suppression therapy [7]. Further￾more, two small, retrospective, observational studies have
reported clinical stabilisation of patients with IPF follow￾ing strategies aimed at the management of GOR [8,9].
Consequently, international guidelines recommend that
the majority of patients with IPF and asymptomatic acid
reflux should receive medical treatment with acid sup￾pression therapy, whilst acknowledging that the evidence
to support such a recommendation is weak [10,11]. Des￾pite the widespread use of acid suppression therapy in pa￾tients with IPF, the impact of such treatment on GOR and
cough in this condition has not been investigated.
Gastroesophageal reflux has long been known to be an
important cause of chronic cough [12]. Indeed a diagnosis
of acid GOR-associated cough is often made following a
successful, empirical trial of high-dose acid suppression
therapy [13]. Thus, a particular attraction of the reflux hy￾pothesis is that it could explain both the pathogenesis of
IPF and the associated symptom of cough.
Despite the accumulating body of evidence linking IPF,
cough and acid reflux, less is known about non-acid reflux
in this context. A recent advance in the assessment of non￾acid reflux is the technique of combined oesophageal pH
and impedance monitoring. This provides a means of de￾tecting and characterizing all reflux episodes regardless of
pH [14]. Using this technique a recent study has shown
a high prevalence of non-acid gastroesophageal reflux in
patients with IPF compared with controls [15]. A study
using pH-impedance monitoring in patients with sys￾temic sclerosis, a condition complicated by oesophageal
dysmotility and GOR, showed a positive relationship be￾tween the degree of acid and non-acid GOR and extent
of pulmonary fibrosis estimated on CT scan [16].
Cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin is known to be in￾creased in IPF suggesting there is up-regulation of sensory
C-fibres in the airways in IPF [17]. Cough reflex sensitivity
to capsaicin is similarly increased in patients with both
acid and non-acid reflux [18].
In this context, the objective of the present study was
to investigate the impact of high-dose acid suppressant
therapy on GOR and cough in this condition.
Methods
Subjects
We recruited 18 consecutive non-smoking subjects meet￾ing the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory
Society criteria for the diagnosis of IPF [1]. Other causes
of cough, except gastroesophageal reflux, were carefully
excluded by clinical history, examination and investigation
in accordance with national guidelines [13]. Subject char￾acteristics are shown in Table 1. One-third of the cohort
were taking immunosuppressive and immune-modulatory
therapies at the time of the study, with some variation
from triple therapy with prednisolone, N-acetylcysteine
and azathioprine due to individual subject’s drug intoler￾ances as detailed in Table 1.
Combined 24 hour pH-impedance and 24 hour
cough monitoring
All acid suppression and prokinetic medication was with￾held for at least one week prior to study assessment. The
18 subjects underwent oesophageal manometry immedi￾ately followed by 24-hour combined pH-impedance moni￾toring (ZepHr, Sandhill Scientific, Highlands Ranch, CO).
Impedance detected reflux events were defined according

to pH as follows: acid reflux, pH <4; weakly acid reflux,
pH 4 – 6.9; non-acid reflux, pH ≥ 7 [19]. Total reflux was
calculated as the sum of acid, weakly acid and non-acid
reflux events. The reference ranges used to define normal
values of reflux events were those previously published for
healthy populations [20]. Abnormal acid exposure was de￾fined as pH <4 for ≥4.2% of the total study time [21]. The
DeMeester score, a composite score based on the number
and length of acid reflux episodes and the length of time
that oesophageal pH <4 [22], was calculated automatically
by the pH-impedance software. Simultaneous 24-hour
cough monitoring was performed using a semi-automated
cough detection system (Leicester Cough Monitor, Version
1.2, with kind permission of Dr Surinder Birring) [23].
Manometry and 24-hour pH-impedance results were
analysed by two experienced operators blinded to the
results of the 24-hour cough count. Operator input for
the 24-hour cough counts was performed by a third op￾erator blinded to the results of the manometry and pH￾impedance as previously described [23].
All 18 subjects were then treated with open label high
dose proton pump inhibitor therapy (omeprazole 40 mg
twice daily or lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily) plus raniti￾dine 300 mg nocte for 8 weeks according to a protocol
agreed a priori. Proton pump inhibition is endorsed by na￾tional and international guidelines as an empiric treatment
for suspected GOR related cough [13,24]. Asymptomatic
GOR is known to be prevalent amongst IPF cohorts as out￾lined above. Therefore, high dose proton pump inhibitor
therapy was used to ensure adequate acid suppression and
H2-receptor antagonism was included in the protocol to
treat potential breakthrough nocturnal reflux [25]. Four￾teen subjects agreed to undergo repeat combined 24-hour
pH-impedance and 24-hour cough assessment following
the 8 week treatment period, the other four subjects with￾drew from the study prior to the second assessment. Three
subjects also received additional prokinetic therapy (meto￾clopramide 10 mg three times daily or domperidone 10 mg
three times daily).
Statistical analysis
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare
paired non-parametric continuous data. The Kruskal￾Wallis test was used to compare differences between
non-parametric categorical variables. Proportions were
compared using Fishers Exact Test. Spearman’s rank order
correlation was used to assess correlation coefficients be￾tween non-parametrically distributed variables. All tests
performed were two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of signifi￾cance (SPSS version 18).
Institutional approval
The study was approved by the South East Wales Ethics
Committee (09/WSE04/57) and the Cardiff and Vale
University Local Health Board Research and Development
Committee (09/CMC/4619). Subjects provided written
informed consent.
Results
Baseline 24-hour pH-impedance data
The spectrum of GOR events recorded for individual
subjects is shown in Figure 1. The number of 24-hour
total reflux events, 24-hour acid reflux events and 24-
hour weakly acid reflux events were within normal limits
for the majority of subjects (83% - 15/18, 78% - 14/18,
94% - 17/18 respectively). Acid exposure time was also
within normal limits for just over half the subjects (56% -
10/18). Most subjects had a negative DeMeester score
(61% - 11/18). Non-acid reflux was present in the majority
of subjects (72% - 13/18). A high proportion of proximal
reflux events (mean 74.7% - Table 2) and supine reflux
events (median 11.7% - Table 3) were recorded in the
study cohort as a whole.
Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was within normal
limits for 61% (11/18) of subjects. There was a significant
negative correlation between the number of total reflux
events and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (r = −0.68,
p < 0.01). Manometry studies showed 17% (3/18) of subjects
had evidence of ineffective oesophageal motility. No other
indices of abnormal oesophageal motility were detected.
Post treatment 24-hour pH-impedance data
Following eight weeks treatment with high dose acid sup￾pression therapy the majority of subjects had a decrease in
the number of acid reflux events (p = 0.02) and an increase
in the number of non-acid reflux events (p = 0.01) (Table 4)
(Figures 2A-D). In three subjects (subjects 4, 7 and 12)
there was no reduction in acid reflux events and no asso￾ciated increase in non-acid reflux events following acid
suppression therapy. There was no significant difference
between the number of 24-hour total reflux events before
and after acid suppression therapy (p = 0.81; Figure 2).
Post treatment 24-hour cough count data
There was no significant change in 24 hour cough count
(median; IQ Range) before (188; 338) and after (240; 382)
acid suppression therapy (p = 0.70; Figure 3). There was
no significant change in total reflux events (p = 0.18) or
cough counts (p = 0.59) before and after therapy in the
three subjects who also received prokinetic therapy.
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the effect of acid sup￾pression therapy on gastroesophageal reflux and cough in
patients with IPF. We have confirmed recent findings that
non-acid reflux is prevalent and that proximal oesophageal
reflux occurs in the majority of patients. This observation

may be important because non-acid reflux (pH ≥7) is
known to be rare in healthy individuals [20,26].
A potential mechanism for chronic cough in patients
with IPF and GOR is enhancement of cough reflex sensitiv￾ity due to neuronal changes within the airways induced by
gastroesophageal refluxate. It has been demonstrated that
induced sputum from patients with IPF contains higher
levels of the neurotrophins, nerve growth factor and brain￾derived neurotrophic factor, compared with normal con￾trols [17]. Furthermore, a study investigating pulmonary
neurotrophin expression in patients with idiopathic intersti￾tial pneumonia found evidence of enhanced expression of
neurotrophins in the lungs of patients with IPF compared
to other interstitial lung diseases, with fibroblastic foci in
particular showing intense immunostaining for brain￾derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB [27]. The
cause of the enhanced neurotrophin expression in the lungs
and airways of patients with IPF is unknown; however these
observations raise the possibility that the neurotrophins
may influence neuronal proliferation and differentiation in
more proximal airways.
Gastric juice is a complex mixture of gastric acid, gastric
enzymes such as pepsin; and bile acids and pancreatic
enzymes from the duodenum. Hence, it may be of acid,
neutral or alkaline pH. The pH of refluxate influences its
biochemical activity and cellular toxicity. For example,
animal studies have shown that within an acidic milieu
pepsin potentiates the degree of acid-induced injury to

oesophageal epithelial cells, but that at neutral pH pepsin
is inactive and its oesophageal epithelial toxicity is amelio￾rated [28]. The toxicity of individual bile acids also varies
with pH and conjugation. Animal studies have shown that
conjugated bile acids cause injury to the oesophageal mu￾cosa at acidic pH, whereas unconjugated bile acids are
more injurious at a neutral pH [29]. In-vitro studies have
shown that human airway epithelial cells exposed to uncon￾jugated bile salts produce increased levels of the fibrogenic
cytokine Transforming Growth Factor-β1 [30]. There is also
preliminary data to suggest that airway epithelial cells
exposed to pepsin can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal
transformation, a process which is implicated in the
pathogenesis of IPF [31]. In this context, our finding of
frequent proximal reflux events in IPF subjects might be
important because it demonstrates a potential mechan￾ism by which alveolar epithelial cells could come into
contact with the many components of gastric juice out￾lined above. A rodent model of chronic aspiration has
shown that lung injury was caused by pH-neutral gastric
constituents but not by hydrochloric acid [32]. There￾fore, it is possible that incremental lung injury caused
by chronic microaspiration is due to the non-acid com￾ponents of gastric juice.
Supine reflux from the stomach into the oesophagus is
rare in normal human subjects [20,26] probably because
lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations are uncommon
during sleep [33]. By contrast, reflux from the duodenum
into the stomach is a normal, physiological, postprandial
event and it also occurs nocturnally [29]. A previous study
in patients with GORD found increased levels of bile acids
in oesophageal aspirates compared with normal controls,
particularly postprandially and in the supine position [34].
Hence, it is also of interest that reflux occurred in the
supine position in the majority of our cohort.
As might be predicted, the present study objectively dem￾onstrated a marked decrease in acid reflux following treat￾ment with high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and
H2-receptor antagonists in the majority of patients with
IPF. However, an unexpected finding was that this was
consistently associated with an increase in non-acid reflux.
Proton pump inhibitors are widely prescribed for acid sup￾pression therapy in patients with IPF; therefore our findings
that increased non-acid reflux may be a consequence of
PPI therapy in such patients is an important observation.
The effect of PPIs on duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux
is complex. Whilst they reduce gastric volume, which
should reduce reflux into the oesophagus, they also delay
gastric emptying which might enhance reflux [35]. It has
been shown that PPIs have no effect on levels of pepsin
or bile acids in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients after
lung transplantation, despite reducing oesophageal acid
exposure [36]. We were careful to exclude other known
causes of cough in this patient cohort. Therefore, our
observation that cough can occur despite verifying low
levels of oesophageal acidity; and that cough counts do
not diminish following high dose acid suppression ther￾apy, suggests that acid-GOR per se is not the sole cause of
cough in IPF. This finding is in keeping with negative ran￾domized, controlled trials of acid suppression therapy in
patients with GOR and chronic cough [37,38].
The exclusion of confounding causes of cough and the
invasive nature of the investigations performed has limited
the size of the study cohort and also resulted in a high
withdrawal rate for the second pH-impedance assessment.
A combination of the small sample size and day to day var￾iations in reflux frequency [39] may explain the unexpect￾edly low rates of acid reflux observed in our population
compared with previous larger studies [7,40]. In addition, a
previous study has shown that objective cough frequency
and subjective cough severity are both reduced by the pres￾ence of an oesophageal catheter [41]. Such an inhibitory
effect may have influenced the detection of a difference in
cough count before and after acid suppression therapy.
However, given that an oesophageal catheter was in situ
both at baseline and eight weeks in the present study and
the absence of a trend towards reduced cough after acid
suppression therapy a type two error of this nature seems
unlikely.
Despite these limitations, the careful subject selection
process means that relevant observations about the rela￾tionship between cough, gastroesophageal reflux and acid
suppression therapy in this condition can be made. The
invasive nature of the investigations also made attempts to
recruit a suitable control group unrewarding. However,
the normal ranges for impedance detected reflux parame￾ters have been well defined in both North American [20]
and European populations [26]. Three subjects were also
treated with prokinetic therapy and whilst no clear evi￾dence of additional effect was observed, the group is too
small to draw conclusions from.
Conclusions
In conclusion, proximal, non-acid reflux is prevalent in
patients with IPF and may be implicated in both the
pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and sensitisation of
the cough reflex in this condition. The lack of improve￾ment in cough symptoms despite effective acid suppres￾sion therapy indicates that acid GOR reflux alone is not
responsible for cough in the majority of patients with IPF.
The finding that acid suppression consistently increases
the frequency of non-acid reflux cautions against the wide￾spread empirical use of acid suppression in IPF and GOR
in the absence of objective pH or impedance testing. Our
findings suggest that strategies for treating GOR in patients
with IPF should target both acid and non-acid reflux, per￾haps by including prokinetic therapies, rather than acid
suppression therapy alone.
