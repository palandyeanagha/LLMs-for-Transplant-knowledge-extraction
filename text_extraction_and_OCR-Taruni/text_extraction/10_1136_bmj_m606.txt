ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To study the clinical characteristics of patients in 
Zhejiang province, China, infected with the 2019 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-2019).
DESIGN
Retrospective case series.
SETTING
Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.
PARTICIPANTS
62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory 
confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected 
from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinical data, collected using a standardised case 
report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, 
incubation period. If information was not clear, the 
working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor 
responsible for treating the patient for clarification.
RESULTS
Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only 
one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no 
patients died during the study. According to research, 
none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province 
were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, 
the original source of the virus; all studied cases were 
infected by human to human transmission. The most 
common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 
(77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 
35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 
32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 
(3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of 
breath on admission. The median time from exposure 
to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 
days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital 
admission was 2 (1-4) days.
CONCLUSION
As of early February 2020, compared with patients 
initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the 
symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are 
relatively mild.
Introduction
In December 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia 
of unknown cause were confirmed to be infected with 
a novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, in Wuhan, 
Hubei province, China, which had previously not been 
detected in humans or animals.1
 Epidemiological 
evidence suggested that most of these patients had 
visited a local seafood market in Wuhan2
 and that 
the gene sequence of the virus obtained from these 
patients was highly similar to that identified in bats.3
The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 as 
it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of 
the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), with 
which it shares more than 79% of its sequence, but it is 
more distant to the coronavirus responsible for Middle 
East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), a member of 
the Merbecovirus subgenus (only 50% homology with 
SARS-Cov-2). All these viruses are categorised within 
the same genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae 
within the family Coronaviridae.4-7 Some researchers 
have found that SARS-Cov-2 has strong affinity to 
human respiratory receptors,8
 suggesting a potential 
threat to global public health.
Initially, the first confirmed cases were nearly all 
related to the Huanan seafood market (closed on 1 
January 2020) and were concentrated in Wuhan.9
Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) soon drew global 
attention because of the rapidly increasing numbers 
of new cases.2
 The new type of coronavirus infection 
was believed to have been transmitted from animals, 
and by January 2020 it was suspected that the initially

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
As of 8 February 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the 
2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has been 
responsible for more than 30 000 infections and 700 deaths globally, and the 
numbers are still increasing rapidly
The reported mortality from infection with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, China reached 
11-15%, which was inconsistent with what was observed outside of Hubei 
province
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan 
have not been described, especially in Zhejiang province, where by 8 February 
2020 more than 1000 people were diagnosed as having covid-19
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
In patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Zhejiang province, the median time from 
exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days) and from 
onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days
The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, headache, 
myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea, and haemoptysis, and only two patients developed 
shortness of breath on admission
At present, compared with the initial patients infected in Wuhan, the symptoms 
of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild

affected patients had been infected with the virus 
through human to human transmission.10 Since 
January 2020 the spread of covid-19 has escalated and 
the virus has extended rapidly to most parts of China 
as well as to other countries. As of 8 February 2020 
a confirmed 37589 people have been infected with 
SARS-Cov-2 globally, including 302 people across 24 
other countries.11 These figures are updated daily and 
are expected to increase further.
Despite the increasing number of confirmed cases, 
the clinical investigation of patients was insufficient. 
A previous study reported the clinical characteristics of 
the first 41 infected patients in the greater Wuhan area, 
contributing to an understanding of the epidemiological, 
clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics 
and treatment and clinical outcomes of those patients.9
A second study found a familial cluster of SARS-Cov-2, 
clearly suggesting human to human transmission in 
family homes and hospitals and showing that spread 
of the virus between cities is possible.10 In late January 
2020 large numbers of people across China were 
returning to their home towns after visiting Wuhan 
for the Chinese lunar new year. This weeklong holiday 
accounts for the largest mass movement of people 
worldwide each year. Consequently, over time more 
patients are expected to emerge across China and 
perhaps the world. We found that the characteristics of 
patients outside of Wuhan differed from those initially 
reported in patients in Wuhan.10
We describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory 
findings of patients in Zhejiang province infected with 
SARS-Cov-2 to provide an insight into the prevention 
and treatment of covid-19 across China and elsewhere.
Methods
Data sources
We conducted a retrospective study focusing on the 
clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 
in Zhejiang province from 10 January 2020 to 26 
January 2020. Since the outbreak of covid-19, strict 
precautionary measures have been implemented in 
Zhejiang province, including the creation of fever clinics 
that exclusively receive patients with suspected SARS￾Cov-2 infection, defined as presenting with a fever or 
any respiratory symptoms, including dry cough, and 
especially in those with a history of travel to Wuhan or 
exposure to infected people within two weeks before 
the onset of illness since January 2020. Case definitions 
of confirmed human infection with SARS-Cov-2 are in 
accordance with the interim guidance from the World 
Health Organization.1
 Only patients with a laboratory 
confirmed infection were enrolled in this study. We 
collected data on 62 patients admitted to hospital with 
laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection in seven 
designated tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang province (see 
supplementary file for further details). Information 
was collected on dates of illness onset, visits to clinical 
facilities, and hospital admissions. Epidemiological 
data were collected through brief interviews with each 
patient. Several investigators interviewed each patient 
to collect exposure histories during the two weeks 
before illness onset, including the dates and times of 
close contact (gathering, living, or working together) 
with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or 
suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection. The incubation period 
was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of 
illness, which was estimated among patients who could 
provide the exact date of close contact with individuals 
from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 
infection. We also investigated the possibility of 
familial clusters—that is, index patients who travelled 
to Wuhan and then infected others in their families.
We extracted the medical records of patients and 
sent these to the data collection centre in Hangzhou. 
A team of doctors who had been treating patients with 
covid-19 collected and reviewed the data. Because 
of the urgent need to collect data on this emerging 
pathogen, the requirement for informed consent 
was waived. We used a standardised case report 
form to collect clinical data. If information was not 
clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the 
doctor responsible for the treatment of the patient for 
clarification.
Laboratory confirmation and treatment
Sputum and throat swab specimens collected from 
all patients at admission were tested by real time 
polymerase chain reaction for SARS-Cov-2 RNA within 
three hours. Laboratory confirmation of the virus 
was performed using real time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction.9
 Virus detection was 
repeated twice every 24 hours.
Laboratory tests were conducted at admission, 
including a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, 
and identification of other respiratory pathogens such 
as influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza 
B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 
virus, and adenovirus. Most patients received antiviral 
treatment with interferon alpha inhalation (50 μg twice 
daily), lopinavir and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily and 
100 mg twice daily, respectively), and arbidol (200 mg 
three times daily). Patients received treatment with 
corticosteroid (40-80 mg/day) and gamma globulin (15-
20 g/day) for 3-5 days when their resting respiratory 
rate was more than 30 per minute, or oxygen saturation 
was below 93% without oxygen, or multiple pulmonary 
lobes showed more than 50% progression of disease in 
48 hours on imaging. Patients also received treatment 
with probiotics in most cases. Quinolones and second 
generation beta lactams (oral and intravenous) were 
administered if fever lasted for more than seven days or 
C reactive protein levels were 30 mg/L or more (normal 
range 0-8 mg/L). Patients suspected of being infected 
with SARS-Cov-2 were discharged from hospital 
once the results of two real time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction tests taken 24 hours apart 
were negative for SARS-Cov-2 antigens.
Statistical analysis
As a previous study9
 has shown that patients’ condition 
worsens on the 10th day after illness onset, we divided 
the cohort into patients with symptoms for more than Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

10 days and those with symptoms for less than 10 days. 
We summarised continuous variables as either means 
and standard deviations or medians with interquartile 
ranges. For categorical variables, we calculated the 
percentages of patients in each category. All analyses 
were done with SPSS software, version 22.0.
Patient and public involvement
This was a retrospective case series study and no 
patients were involved in the study design, setting the 
research questions, or the outcome measures directly. 
No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or 
writing up of results.
Results
Epidemiological characteristics
By 26 January 2020, clinical data were collected on 
62 patients in Zhejiang province with laboratory 
confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Twenty five (40%) 
of the patients were aged 19-40 years, 33 (53%) were 
aged 41-65 years, 2 (3%) were aged 10 and 11 years, 
and 2 (3%) were aged 65 years and older. The median 
age was 41 years (interquartile range 32-52 years; 
table 1). As of 26 January 2020, more than half of 
the 62 patients (35, 56%) were men. No patients had 
a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market 
and all 62 patients had been exposed to individuals 
with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Among the 62 
patients, 23 (37%) resided in Wuhan and the remaining 
39 (63%) had made short term trips to Wuhan before 
illness onset. Fifty six (90%) patients could provide 
the exact date of close contact with someone with 
confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Of the 33 patients with symptoms for more than 10 
days after illness onset, 10 (30%) were aged 19-40 
years, 22 (67%) were aged 41-65 years, and 1 (3%) 
was older than 65 years. The median age of patients 
was 45 years (interquartile range 37-54 years; table 1).
Clinical features
Twenty of the 62 patients (32%) had underlying 
diseases—seven (11%) had liver disease, five (8%)

had hypertension, and one (2%) each had chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, renal 
disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Twenty one of 
the 62 patients (34%) were associated with familial 
clusters.
Of the 33 patients with symptoms for more than 
10 days after illness onset, 13 (39%) had underlying 
diseases: four (12%) patients had liver disease, four 
(12%) had hypertension, and one each had chronic

who could provide the exact date of close contact 
with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS￾Cov-2 infection, the median incubation period from 
exposure to symptoms was 4 days (interquartile range 
3-5 days). The median time from onset of symptoms 
to first hospital admission was 2.0 (1.0-4.3) days. The 
most common symptoms at illness onset were fever 
(48, 77%), cough (50, 81%), expectoration (35, 56%), 
headache (21, 34%), myalgia or fatigue (32, 52%), 
diarrhoea (3, 8%), and haemoptysis (2, 3%). Only two 
(3%) patients developed shortness of breath. Among 
the 33 patients who had symptoms for more than 10 
days after illness onset, the median incubation period 
from exposure to symptoms was 3 days (interquartile 
range 3-4 days). The median time from onset of 
symptoms to first hospital admission was 6.5 (5.0-9.0)

Fifty five (89%) patients had normal serum levels of 
procalcitonin (<0.1 ng/mL). Abnormalities on chest 
computed tomograms or radiographs were detected 
among all of the patients except for one. Fifty two 
(84%) patients showed bilateral involvement on 
chest radiographs (table 2). Typical chest computed 
tomography findings of infected patients on admission 
were bilateral or multiple lobular or subsegmental 
areas of consolidation or bilateral ground glass opacity 
(fig 1). Only one patient did not have pneumonia. Of the 
62 patients, only one was transferred to an intensive 
care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome 
and received mechanical ventilation (table 3). Fifty 
five (89%) patients received antiviral treatment, 28 
(45%) were given empirical antibiotic treatment, and 
16 (26%) were given systematic corticosteroid and 
gamma globulin treatment. At this point, one (2%) 
patient had been discharged and no patients had died. 
Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever 
for at least three days, with improved evidence on 
chest radiography and viral clearance in samples from 
the lower respiratory tract.
Discussion
As of 8 February 2020, more than 30000 laboratory 
confirmed cases of infection with the novel coronavirus 
(SARS-Cov-19) were reported in China.12 The number 
of infections is increasing rapidly. It is possible that an 
even greater number of infected patients exist without 
a diagnosis because their symptoms were less severe 
and because of the incubation period. Thousands of 
patients with suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection could 
eventually receive a diagnosis. The clinical features of 
early cases of covid-19 in Wuhan were not the same as 
those in other areas of China. According to our data, 
none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province had 
been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, and as 
the number of familial clusters in infected patients in 
our study is large, this might suggest human to human 
transmission. This finding is also consistent with a 
published article.10 Further detailed investigations 
should aim to ascertain the exact mode of transmission.
Most of the infected individuals in Zhejiang province 
were male patients, but the age range of patients is 
large as SARS-Cov-2 also infected children and those 
older than 65 years.9 13 No major differences were 
found between the initial clinical symptoms of patients 
in Zhejiang province and those in Wuhan. Most of

the patients in Zhejiang province, however, had mild 
to moderate symptoms, and only a small portion of 
them had dyspnoea. Only one patient developed acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and was admitted to an 
intensive care unit. The laboratory test results showed 
that the patients also experienced mild illness. There 
were fewer patients with abnormal renal function 
and lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin levels. 
Through media and national advocacy, patients 
with fever, cough, expectoration, and other upper 
respiratory tract symptoms were asked to go to hospital 
at an early stage. Even those who had contact with 
other patients, or patients with suspected infection 
were asked to go to hospital. We also analysed patients 
with symptoms for more than 10 days after illness 
onset. We found that the clinical features of patients 
with symptoms for longer than 10 days in Zhejiang 
province were less severe than those of the primary 
infected patients from Wuhan.9 13 This phenomenon 
was also apparent during the transmission of MERS￾CoV. The global case mortality of MERS-CoV was about 
40%, whereas the mortality from second generation 
MERS-CoV was about 20%.14 15
Patients in the two cohorts received antiviral 
treatment, but the types of drugs used varied between 
patients. Treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir 
were reported to have the potential to treat SARS 
infections,16 and we suppose this treatment might be 
a beneficial part of the treatment for covid-19. The rate 
of antibiotic and corticosteroid use was different. Less 
than half the patients in Zhejiang province received 
antibiotics. Whether the use of antivirals, antibiotics, 
or steroids affects the prognosis of patients remains 
unknown.
Given that most infections in Zhejiang province 
were in patients who had no direct contact with the 
original site of outbreak, our findings provide valuable 
information in the understanding of the clinical 
features of covid-19, as the number of people with 
confirmed disease continues to increase rapidly. Our 
study population might represent most of the clinical 
characteristics of infected patients since January 2020. 
Further containment proposals should be implemented 
by the Chinese government, such as preventing people 
from Wuhan having contact with those elsewhere, 
banning gatherings of more than 100 people, 
conducting daily public-wide educational campaigns 
on precautionary measures against exposure to SARS￾Cov-2, encouraging people to cancel traditional family 
gatherings such as during the Chinese lunar new year, 
and extending the Chinese lunar new year holiday to 
prevent large scale spread.
Limitations of this study
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 62 
patients were included. A large number of patients 
were continually being admitted to hospital as data 
were being collected, and thus we obtained data 
on most but not all of the patients with laboratory 
confirmed infection in Zhejiang province during the 
study period. Secondly, as the patients were only 
from Zhejiang province, it might be that more clinical 
features related to covid-19 will be identified. Thirdly, 
at the time of study submission, most patients had 
not been discharged, so we are unable to estimate 
either the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality. 
Moreover, the time since illness onset in some of our 
patients might be shorter than the observation period 
of 10 days, which could result in biases of clinical 
observation characteristics.
Conclusion
Compared with the symptoms of the initial patients 
with SARS-Cov-2 infection in Wuhan, those of patients 
from Zhejiang province in our study were relatively 
mild. Currently, no effective drug treatment or vaccine 
exists. It is necessary for monitoring of the virus to be 
strengthened and drugs and vaccines to be developed 
against SARS-Cov-2 infection as soon as possible.
