Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen of which several species of animal were reported as reservoirs. Swine stands
out as the major reservoir for HEV infection in humans, as suggested by the close genetic relationship of swine and human
virus. Since 2000, Genotype 4 HEV has become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in China. Recent reports showed
that genotype 4 HEV is freely transmitted between humans and swine in eastern and southern China. However, the
infection status of HEV in human and swine populations in central China is still unclear. This study was conducted in a rural
area of central China, where there are many commercial swine farms. A total of 1476 serum and 554 fecal specimens were
collected from the general human and swine populations in this area, respectively. The seroepidemiological study was
conducted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conserved genomic sequences of open reading frame 2 were detected
using reverse transcription-PCR. The results indicated that the overall viral burden of the general human subjects was 0.95%
(14/1476), while 7.0% (39/554) of the swine excreted HEV in stool. The positive rate of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in the serum
samples was 7.9% (117/1476) and 1.6% (24/1476), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 150 nt partial sequence
of the capsid protein gene showed that the 53 swine and human HEV isolates in the current study all belonged to genotype
4, clustering into three major groups. However, the HEV isolates prevalent in the human and swine populations were
classified into known distinct subgenotypes, which suggested that no cross-species transmission between swine and
humans had taken place in this area. This result was confirmed by cloning and phylogenetic analysis of the complete capsid
protein gene sequence of three representative HEV strains in the three major groups. The cross reactivity between anti-HEV
IgG from human sera and the two representative strains from swine in central China was confirmed by Dot-blot assay. In
conclusion, although all the HEV strains prevalent in central China belonged to genotype 4, there is no evidence of cross￾species transmission between human and swine in this area.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a member of the genus Hepevirus, is
a non-enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome
approximately 7.2 kb in length [1]. HEV has been the cause of
waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis in Asia and Africa and is a
major cause of sporadic hepatitis in these regions. Acute
infection primarily affects young adults and is generally self￾limiting and resolves in 1–6 weeks, except in women during late
pregnancy, among whom 20% mortality has been reported.
Chronic HEV infection has recently been reported in transplant
recipients [2]. Person-to-person transmission is uncommon [3].
Parenteral and vertical transmission of HEV has been reported,
though the role of such transmission in the spread of disease is
likely to be limited.
HEV and antibodies to HEV have been found in a wide variety
of animals [4–7]. It has been hypothesised that zoonosis is involved
in the transmission of HEV, especially in non-endemic areas.
Swine stands out as a reservoir for hepatitis E virus (HEV)
infection in humans,because of the close genetic relationship
between swine and human virus and reports of cross-species
infection of HEV [8,9]. The first animal strain of HEV, designated
swine HEV, to be isolated and characterized was obtained from a
pig in the United States [8]. Subsequently, many HEV samples
from swine in over a dozen countries have been identified. Some
isolates of swine HEV have been shown to be capable of infecting
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8156

rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees, although other isolates can only
infect swine [10].
HEV isolates were divided into four distinct genotypes
according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 1
was previously believed to only infect humans, but this has been
disputed recently by a report of this subtype in a pig from
Cambodia [11]. Genotype 2 has only been identified in humans in
Mexico and Africa (Nigeria, Chad). Genotype 3 is prevalent in
swine herds and humans all over the world. Genotype 4 HEV was
first detected in humans in 1993 [12] and is mainly distributed in
China, Japan, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Genotype 4 HEV
has a wide host range, being prevalent in humans, swine, and
some other animals. Hepatitis E was first recognized in China after
a large epidemic in the southern part of the Xinjiang Uighur
autonomous region [13]. Since 2000, Genotype 4 HEV has
become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in China [14].
Recent reports showed that genotype 4 HEV is transmitted
between humans and swine in eastern and southern China [9,15].
The aim of the present study, which was conducted in the swine￾farming districts of central China, was to elucidate the relationship
between concurrent isolates from swine and humans and thereby
ascertain whether swine is a significant source of HEV for human
hepatitis E disease in this area.
Results
Occurrence of HEV
Table 1 presents the prevalence of HEV antibodies and RNA in
1476 serum samples collected from the general human populations
in the central China. The 122 serum samples which were positive
for HEV antibodies (IgG or IgM) were analysed further for the
presence or absence of HEV RNA by RT-PCR. The results
showed that 24 individuals (1.63%) had current infection (i.e., they
were reactive for anti-HEV IgM), and 58.3% (14/24) of these
infections were accompanied by viremia (i.e., they were positive
for viral RNA). The overall viral burden of the study subjects was
estimated to be 0.95% (14/1476). This probably approximates the
viral burden of the general human population in central China.
None of the 98 serum samples which were only positive for IgG
tested positive for HEV RNA.
Table 2 shows the age-specific prevalence of anti-HEV among
the general population in central China from 2007 to 2008. The
40–59 years age group shows the highest prevalence rate of anti￾HEV IgG (10.2%), while the 2–19 years age group shows the
lowest prevalence rate of anti-HEV IgG (5.1%). No significant
difference of anti-HEV IgG prevalence was found between the
males and females: 8.1% (63/779) of male and 7.8% (54/697) of
females (P = 0.462). Our questionnaire showed that 176 individ￾uals had a history of frequent travel to other regions, 9.1% (16/
176) of them tested positive for IgG, which was not significantly
different from those who did not report frequent travel to other
regions (7.8% or 101/1300 P = 0.271). Of the 98 individuals who
were positive for anti-HEV IgG, only two have ever been admitted
to a hospital because of hepatitis E.
Table 3 presents the prevalence of HEV RNA in the swine
group in central China. The pigs at age of 10–15 weeks old
showed the highest prevalence rate of 9.8% (14/143), and the pigs
older than 20 weeks showed the lowest prevalence rate 4.6% (5/
109). The overall prevalence rate was 7.0% (39/554), and this
probably approximates the HEV burden of pigs on swine farms in
central China.
Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis
The 150-nt PCR-amplified products from 39 swine and 14
human HEV isolates were sequenced. The results identified 28
swine and 14 human HEV isolates with distinct nucleotide
sequences. The sequences were deposited in GenBank, isolate
names were from Ch-MD-hu1 to Ch-MD-hu14 and from Ch￾MD-sw1 to Ch-MD-sw28, and the corresponding accession
numbers were FJ641988-FJ641993 and FJ641994-FJ642021,
respectively. A BLAST search using these 42 sequences showed
that these isolates all belonged to genotype 4 HEV, and some of
the matching sequences from GenBank are included in Figure 1.

In order to further classify the 42 genotype 4 HEV strains,
phylogenetic analysis was performed including 16 well character￾ized reference sequences [16]. Results indicated that 41 of the
strains determined in the present study partitioned into three main
groups, designated group 1, 2 and 3, while the other specimen
clustered alone (Fig. 1). Group 1, which consisted of 21 diverse
swine specimens, clustered with a bootstrap value of 59%, and had
an intra-group diversity which ranged from 0.6% to 7.1%.
Reference sequence (AF151962) identified group 1 to be of
subtype 4a. Group 2 consisted of 6 swine specimens which group
together with a bootstrap value of 97%. Group 2 shows an intra￾group diversity from 0.3% to 2.4% and could be classified into
subtype 4d according to the reference sequences (AJ272108 and
AY594199). Group 3 was also diverse and included all 14 human
specimens which group together with a bootstrap value of 97%
and have an intra-group diversity ranging from 0.4% to 6.4%.
The reference used (AB080575) defined group 3 as subtype 4c.
The left four columns of table 4 show the sequence differences
between the three groups and the strains with full genome
available in GenBank over the 150nt region. From these
differences we could conclude that group1, 2 and 3 were most
similar to genotype4a, genotype4d and genotype4c, respectively,
which confirmed the results of the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1).
From the three major groups, three representative strains, Ch￾MD-sw1, Ch-MD-sw23 and Ch-MD-hu1, were selected and their
complete ORF2 sequences were determined. Sequence analysis
based on the complete ORF2 sequence indicated that the two
swine HEV strains, Ch-MD-sw23 and Ch-MD-sw1, shared 91.7%
sequence homology with each other, and 89.7% and 89.3% with
the human isolate Ch-MD-hu1, respectively. Their putative amino
acid sequences shared 98.5–99.4% sequence identity. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed based on the three representative isolates
in the present study and 17 referenced, and well characterized,
genotype 4 HEV isolates [16]. The Ch-MD-hu1 strain clustered
together with 2 Japanese human genotype 4 isolates (AB080575
and AB220979) with a 92% bootstrap value and shared 93.0%
and 92.2% sequence identity with them, respectively, which
classified Ch-MD-hu1 as genotype4c. The swine isolate Ch-MD￾sw1 clustered together with two Chinese isolates (AJ272108 and
AY594199) with a 100% bootstrap value and they shared a 90.8%
and 92.4% sequence identity, respectively, which indicted Ch￾MD-sw1 belonged to genotype4d. The other swine HEV isolate,
Ch-MD-sw23, clustered with 5 other Chinese or Japanese
genotype 4 strains with a 100% bootstrap value and they shared
92.3-93.6% sequence identity. The references used here defined
Ch-MD-sw23 as genotype4a. The three columns on the right of
table 4 show the genetic differences between the three strains
whose entire ORF2 was sequenced in the present study and those
of all the full genome strains available in GenBank calculated over
the full ORF2 region. We conclude that Ch-MD-sw1, Ch-MD￾sw23 and Ch-MD-hu1 show the closest sequence identity with
genotype4d, genotype4a and genotype4c, respectively, which is
consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis based on the
entire ORF2 region (Fig. 2).
Combining these results, it suggests that there are two different
subgenotypes of genotype 4 HEV strains prevalent in swine
populations in central China, and they are genetically distinct from
the strains which are prevalent in general human populations in
this area.
Dot-Blot Assay
The reactivity of the two representative swine HEV strains (Ch￾MD-sw1 and Ch-MD-sw23) with the 29 serum samples which were
positive for anti-HEV IgG was determined by Dot-blot assay.
Fig. 3A presents the Dot-blot assay using the 9 serum samples which
were positive for IgM, IgG and HEV RNA. Results show a strong
reaction between the 9 sera and the two representative HEV strains
in the dot-blot assay. Fig. 3B presents the Dot-blot assay using the 20
randomly selected serum samples which were positive for anti-HEV
IgG but not for IgM or HEV RNA. Results showed that 19 (95%) of
them reacted with the two HEV strains. None of the negative
controls showed evident reactivity in the assay.
Discussion
There is gathering evidence that HEV is enzootic and pigs are
considered one of the major reservoirs of human infection with this
virus. The zoonotic transmission of HEV from pigs to humans has
been suggested previously, particularly for cases in non-endemic
areas. This hypothesis was mainly based on phylogenetic analysis,
which showed that swine and human HEV strains from same
geographic regions share a high genomic similarity [9,17–19]. Tei
et al. provided direct evidence of zoonotic transmission of HEV
from deer to human: patients became infected with HEV after
eating raw meat of an infected deer [20]. A similar scenario has
also been documented [21]: a patient was hospitalized after eating
wild boar meat. Furthermore, there was only one nt difference
between the sequence from the patient and the wild boar meat
over the 1,980 nt of the entire ORF2 giving a nucleotide sequence
identity of 99.95%.
Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 150 nt partial ORF2
HEV sequences from both humans and pigs, Zheng et al reported
that genotype 4 HEV transmitted freely between swine and
humans in eastern China [9]. In the present study, our research
was conducted in three swine farming districts in the central
China, however, the HEV strains prevalent in swine (Fig. 1,
group1 and 2) were genetically distinct from those prevalent in the
human populations (Fig. 1, group3). This was confirmed by the
phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 genome sequence of
three representative strains from the three groups, though these 53
strains all belonged to genotype 4 virus. Previous analysis has
shown the 150-nt ORF2 sequence used in this study to be
phylogenetically informative and to give similar trees to those
based on the entire viral genome [22,23], and on this we base the
phylogenetic relationship of the 44 isolates in the present study
established in the radial phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1).
From the sequencing results, some of the 39 swine HEV strains
showed non-unique sequences over the 150nt region. Among these
were four strains which had identical sequences but came from
two different farms. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that some
of swine or human strains were very closely related (e.g. Ch-MD￾sw4, 7 and 10 in group 1, and Ch-MD-hu4, 6 and 11 in group3 in
Fig. 1), although our sampling/questionnaire records showed that

not all of the non-unique or closely related strains were collected
from the same farm or households. These probably represent an
outbreak with the same HEV strain within this area or, imported
via other transmission routes.
Hepatitis E is classically a water-borne infectious disease. Water
contaminated by hepatitis E virus (HEV) that is being shed
enterically from humans and animals may lead to large outbreaks
of Hepatitis E [13,24]. Recent studies suggested that genotype 4
virus freely circulated among swine and humans in eastern China
where there are many rivers. One study found that persons living
in communities downstream of swine farms were at 29% higher
risk of infection than persons living in communities upstream [9].
Therefore, water contaminated by HEV may contribute to the
zoonotic transmission from swine to human in eastern China.

Over the last few years there have been a flurry of case reports,
case series and descriptions of small scale outbreaks relating to
hepatitis E from Japan [20,21]. There, HEV is enzootic among
deer, boars and swine, and disease is linked to the eating of raw
venison and boar liver, and of inadequately cooked boar meat and
pig liver. The evidence appears to indicate that hepatitis E in
Japan is a food-, not water-, borne disease, and also a zoonosis.
In the present study, our research was conducted in central
China, which is an area of plains with few rivers. Most of the local
rural residents consume deeply drilled borehole water. Moreover,
the residents in this area are not known to have a penchant for
eating raw meat. All these factors make the circulation of HEV in
swine or humans independent in central China and thus
significantly reduce the chance of HEV cross-species transmission

from animals to human. Whether there are other factors which
hinder human HEV strains from infecting pigs or vice versa will
need to be elucidated by further research.
In the present study, all the human serum samples were
collected from the general population. None of the 24 persons
who were positive for anti-HEV IgM showed evident clinical
symptoms of hepatitis, and only two of the 98 persons who were
only positive for anti-HEV IgG had a history of being diagnosed
with hepatitis E. This suggests that HEV infection in central
China is commonly sub-clinical. Thus, HEV infection may
persist in disease-endemic populations by serial transmission
among susceptible persons in the form of subclinical and
asymptomatic infection. These subclinical cases, which go
unnoticed, may act as one of the reservoirs for persistence of
this infection in the population and as a source of sporadic acute
hepatitis E. A similar continual transmission of subclinical
infection was the main reservoir of poliovirus in areas in which
the disease was endemic. Subclinical HEV infection in laboratory
infected cynomolgus macaques was observed by Aggarwal, who
reported that subclinical HEV infection in some animals was
associated with failure of the development of an immune response
when compared with animals with clinical HEV infection [25].
Further study should be performed to elucidate whether the
phenomenon occurs routinely during human subclinical HEV
infection.
Most of the evidence supporting animal–human transmission of
HEV is from regions where HEV infection is not endemic. In
India, an endemic area for HEV, some reports indicate that
zoonotic transmission of HEV from pigs to humans does not exist,
and the strains prevalent in human populations all belong to
genotype 1 HEV while those prevalent in pigs belong to genotype
4 [26,27]. The genotype 1 HEV strains were proven to be unable
to to infect pigs [28,29]. Therefore, the phenotypically distinct
genotypes could be used to interpret why zoonotic transmission
was not observed in India.
In the present study, although HEV strains prevalent in human
and swine groups in central China all belonged to genotype 4, and
the complete ORF2 sequence of representative strains shared
nucleotide and amino acid identity of more than 89% and 98%,
respectively, they clustered separately into genetically distinct
clusters. This suggested that the swine and human HEV isolates in
central China are distinct from each other, this phenomenon is not
attributed to virus genotype but non-viral factors, such as human
living habits, living environments, and local climate.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the full or partial ORF2
sequences showed that the human or swine isolates in the present
study cross clustered with the swine and human isolates from other
regions of China and even Japan (Fig. 1 and 2), which may be due
to travel of infected persons or or trading of infected pigs between
China and Japan. This phenomenon should be elucidated by
future research.
So far, genotype 1 and 4 HEV viruses have been found to be
prevalent in human populations in China where genotype 4 HEV
has become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease since 2000
[14]. Zheng et al. isolated 21 HEV strains in the human sera
collected from 2002 to 2005 in eastern China [9]. Only 4 of the 21
HEV strains belonged to genotype 1, and all 4 strains were isolated
from the sera collected in 2002.

In the present study, we used the primers which had been
optimized for genotypes 1 and 4 virus RNA detection [22], but all
the 14 HEV strains that were isolated from the sera collected from
central China belonged to genotype 4, suggesting genotype 4 HEV
is the main genotype prevalent in this area. Although the primers
also afford sensitive detection for genotype 3 strains, a genotype
that was recently reported to be prevalent in swine groups in some
areas of China [19,20], we did not detected genotype 3 strains
among the 554 swine fecal samples collected from central China.
In the present study, the age group 20–39 years had the highest
positive rate of IgM, suggesting that people in this age group have
the highest clinical attack rates in central China. This is consistent
with the current opinion that the peak incidence in sporadic cases
of hepatitis E in endemic regions occurs in 15-35-year-olds
[31,32]. IgG seropositivity reaches a plateau in the age group 40–
59 years (Table 2) which was consistent with a recent age￾prevalence study performed in southern China that indicated that
the highest seropositivity was recorded in the age group 45–55
years [15]. A similar conclusion was reached in Japan where
seropositivity reaches a plateau in the age group 40–49 years [33].
Specific IgG is usually produced early in infection and concen￾trations rise rapidly afterwards [34]. Estimates of the duration of
the IgG response and immunity to subsequent infection vary, but
the antibody has been detected for at least 12 years after acute
infection [35]. Therefore, we believe that the higher positivity rate
of IgG in older people (.40 years) is mostly due to infection earlier
in life (20–39 years).
HEV has been isolated and fully sequenced. Sequence analysis
of the various genotypes of HEV isolates shows significant
similarity of the genomes and many cross-reactive epitopes
between these different genotypes. It has been shown that
antibodies to one strain are cross-reactive with the other strains,
indicating cross-protection between strains. The anti-HEV assays
used in the current study used a recombinant peptide of a
genotype 1 HEV structural protein that occurs naturally as a
homodimer [36]. Previous studies have shown that the IgM
antibody detected by the assay is a reliable marker of recent HEV
infection and that the seroprevalence of IgG antibody reflects the
cumulative exposure of a study population to HEV [37,38]. In the
current study, the reactivity of the two representative swine HEV
with antibodies in their serum samples were tested by Dot-blot
assay. The results suggested that the anti-HEV antibodies
prevalent in human populations can cross-protect against the
strains prevalent in swine groups in central China.
In conclusion, the present study investigated the HEV infection
status in the general human population and swine groups in
central China. The positive rate of anti-HEV IgG and IgM of the
studied subjects was 7.9% (117/1476) and 1.6% (24/1476),
respectively. HEV RNA was detected in 0.95% (14/1476) of the
general human subjects and 7.0% (39/554) of the swine stool
samples. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that although all the HEV
strains prevalent in central China belonged to genotype 4, the
strains prevalent in swine were genetically distinct from those
prevalent in the human populations, which suggested that cross￾species transmission of HEV between human and swine might not
exist in this area.
Materials and Methods
Sampling
From September in 2007 to September in 2008, a total of 1476
serum specimens were collected from general populations (779
males and 697 females, age range 2-79 years) of rural communities
in central China, including Fuyang ( lies on the boundary of Anhui
and Henan Province), Huaibei (lies on the boundary of Anhui and
Shandong Province ), and Suzhou (lies on the boundary of Anhui
and Jiangsu Province). Most of the participants in the present
study were farmers who mainly working on crops growing, and
agricultural products processing. All participants $16 years of age
gave written consent after receiving a full explanation of the study,
and written consent was also obtained from the parents of the
participants ,16 years of age. The Ethics Committee of Shanghai
Research Center for Biomodel Organism approved the study. A
questionnaire was used to record individual’s history of ever being
admitted to a hospital because of hepatitis E and frequently
tripping to other regions. A total of 554 fecal samples were
obtained from pigs aged from 4 to 26 weeks old from March to
August in 2008. The swine fecal samples were obtained from 11
swine farms in Fuyang, Huaibei, and Suzhou. Fuyang lies about
200 km from Suzhou and Huaibei. Huaibei lies about 100 km
from Suzhou. All the swine farms are formalized and have good
sanitation status.
Detection of Anti-HEV IgG and IgM
Anti-HEV IgG and IgM levels were determined using
commercial ELISAs (Wan Tai Pharmaceutical, Beijing, China).
The ELISAs were performed with a recombinant peptide
corresponding to aa 394–606 of the major structural protein
specified by open reading frame (ORF) 2 of the HEV genome.
Testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Detection of HEV-RNA
Total RNA was extracted from 100 uL of serum sample or
feacal suspension, using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA). RT-PCR was
performed as described elsewhere [22]. Briefly, a 150-nt segment
of ORF2, nt 6317–6466 relative to HEV D10330, was amplified
using primers E1 (59-CTGTTTAAYCTTGCTGACAC- 39) and
E5 (59-WGARAGCCAAAGCACATC-39) for the first round of
PCR and primers E2 (59-GACAGAATTGATTTCGTCG- 39)
and E4 (59-TGYTGGTTRTCRTAATCCTG-39) for the second
round. PCR cycling conditions for both rounds consisted of 35
cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94uC, annealing for 30 s at 53uC,
and extension for 40 s at 72uC.
Determination of the Full Nucleotide Sequences of ORF2
The complete sequences of ORF2 of the three representative
strains of the three major clusters in the phylogenetic analysis were
determined using RT-PCR method with the primers designed
according to the related sequences available in GenBank.
Sequencing
Specific bands for HEV were purified from 1% agarose gel
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Gemany). The
purified PCR products were ligated into pMD18-T Vector
(TaKaRa, Japan). For each product, three positive colonies were
selected and sequenced. A consensus sequence of each fragment
was saved and used for phylogenetic analysis or assemble of the full
ORF2 sequence.
Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis
The viral nucleotide or putative amino-acid sequences were
aligned using ClustaX1.8 or DNAstar software. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the neighbor-joining method and evalu￾ated using the interior branch test method with MEGA software
(version 4.0; available at: http: //www.megasoftware.net/).

Dot-Blot Assay
To test the reactivity between the anti-HEV IgG detected in
human sera and HEV particles in the swine fecal suspensions. The
9 serum samples which showed positive for both anti-HEV IgG
and HEV RNA, and 20 of the 98 serum samples which showed
positive only for anti-HEV IgG were selected and examined by
Dot-blot assay using two representative strains: Ch-MD-sw1 and
Ch-MD-sw23, whose complete ORF2 sequences were determined
in the present study. A HEV-negative swine fecal suspension was
included as a negative control. Briefly, HEV-positive swine feacal
specimens were converted to 10% (w/v) suspensions in PBS, and
clarified by centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min. Then about
30 ul suspension were spotted onto PVDF membrane strips. Blots
were blocked by shaking the at 37uC for one hour with TBS-T
(2% Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20)
containing 5% skim milk powder. Then, blots were washed three
times with TBS-T and incubated with each serum diluted 1:200 in
TBS-T (1 h at room temperature with constant shaking). A human
serum negative for anti-HEV IgG were included as negative
control. After incubation, blots were washed four times with TBS￾T, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat
anti-human IgG (Dingguo, Beijing, China) at a 1:10,000 dilution.
After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, blots were washed
four times with TBS-T and color development was carried out
using a chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL AdvanceTM
Western Blotting Detection kit, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).
