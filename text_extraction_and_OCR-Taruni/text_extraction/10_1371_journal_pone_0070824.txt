Abstract
Background: Immunosuppressive therapy is usually administered following renal transplantation to protect the graft from
rejection. However, this often causes complications such as infections to occur. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
within the CTLA4 gene, such as 21772T/C (rs733618), +49A/G (rs231775) and +6230 G/A (rs3087243), can affect graft
rejection and the long-term clinical outcome of organ transplantation. The role of CTLA4 SNPs in T cell-mediated immunity
in renal transplantation and association with infection after transplantation is unknown.
Methods: In this study, the risk of infection according to CTLA4 SNPs was investigated in 304 patients who received kidney
graft transplants between 2008 and 2012.
Results: The frequency of the rs4553808 GG genotype was significantly higher in recipients with viral infection (14.89%)
than in those without infections (3.50%) (Bonferroni-adjusted p = 0.005). A significant difference (p = 0.001) in patients with
the rs4553808 GG genotype from those with the AA+AG genotypes was found in the viral cohort using the log-rank test. A
significant association was found between the rs4553808 genotype and onset of viral infection in transplant recipients
(p = 0.001). The frequencies of the CGTAG and CGCAG haplotypes were significantly higher in the viral infection group (9.6%
and 5.3%) than in the non-viral infection group (3.8% and 1.4%) (p = 0.0149 and p = 0.0111). No association between any
CTLA4 SNP and bacterial infection was found. Multivariate analyses revealed that one risk factor, the use of antibody
induction therapy (p = 0.007), was associated with bacterial infection, and two risk factors, antibody use (p = 0.015) and
recipient rs4553808 genotype (p = 0.001), were associated with viral infection.
Conclusions: The rs4553808 GG genotype may be a risk factor for viral infection in kidney transplantation. The CTLA4
haplotypes CGTAG and CGCAG were partially associated with the development of viral infection in Chinese kidney
transplant recipients.

Introduction
Immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine A (CsA),
tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or prednisone
(Pred), are typically administered to renal transplant patients to
prevent graft rejection. However, this can lead to complications
including various bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, such as
pneumonia and urinary tract infections [1–5].
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a
critical negative regulator of the T cell-mediated immune response
and a key element that induces immune tolerance in the immune
system [6]. It is also expressed constitutively on the surface of
regulatory T cells (Tregs); it is detectable on approximately 50% of
Tregs, but found on only ,1% of naive helper T cells [7]. CTLA4
ligation on Tregs results in a significant decrease in the
presentation capacity of antigen-presenting cells and effector T
cell downregulation in mice [8]. CTLA4 plays an important role in
the downregulation of the immune response. The expression
pattern of the protein encoded by CTLA4 was found to be altered
by the polymorphisms rs4553808 (21661A/G) and rs5742909
(2318C/T) in the CTLA4 gene promoter [9]. Similarly, the
rs733618 (21772T) allele was found to decrease the transcription
level of CTLA4 by influencing the binding of transcription factors
[10]. The rs231775 (+49A/G) SNP is located within the signal
peptide of the molecule and influences the expression of the full￾length isoform on the T cell surface. The rs3087243 (+6230G/A)
SNP is located within the 39 untranslated region of the CTLA-4
gene and was found to be associated with susceptibility to
autoimmune diseases [11]. Furthermore, the SNPs within the
CTLA4 gene, such as 21772T/C (rs733618), +49A/G (rs231775)
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e70824

and +6230 G/A (rs3087243), play an influential role in graft
rejection and the long-term clinical outcome of organ transplan￾tation [12–17].
The CTLA4 gene polymorphism has been suggested to influence
infection after pediatric heart transplantation. Ohmann et al. [18]
reported that SNP CTLA4 +49(rs231775) may be associated with
late post-transplantation viral infection in pediatric heart trans￾plant recipients in the USA.
The role of CTLA4 SNPs in T cell-mediated immunity in renal
transplantation and association with infection after transplantation
is unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the
associations between five CTLA4 SNPs (rs733618 C/T, rs4553808
A/G, rs5742909 C/T, rs231775 A/G, and rs3087243 G/A) and
infection in Chinese kidney transplant recipients.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This study included 304 transplant recipients (264 deceased
donor cases and 40 living donor cases; 192 men and 112 women)
in the Shanghai Organ Transplantation Center between Jan 2008
and Dec 2012; post-transplant infections occurred in 123
recipients, and no infection occurred in 181 cases. Of the 123
patients with infections, 61 recipients suffered from bacterial
infection, 47 from viral infection, 11 from fungal infection and 4
from other infection. The mean age of the patients in the study
was 43.76612.01 years. Overall, 287 of the patients received
transplantation for chronic glomerulonephritis, 9 for polycystic
kidney disease, and 8 for pyelonephritis. Only subjects with
negative infection status were eligible for transplantation. All of the
recipients were blood group-matched with their donors and were
tested for panel-reactive antibody and HLA-A-B-DR matching.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee
review boards of our hospital and Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Each organ
donation or transplant in our center was strictly selected according
to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee review board of our
hospital, the Organ Transplant Regulation Committee of Shang￾hai Jiao Tong University and the Declaration of Helsinki. The
research process, including the collection and storage of blood,
isolation of DNA and determination of gene polymorphisms, was
explained in detail to every candidate patient. Every participant
provided written informed consent.
Infection was defined as clinical evidence of an infectious
process occurring within the first year after transplantation. The
date of infection, type of infection (bacterial, viral, fungal,
protozoan, or no organism identified), location of infection,
therapy administered, and outcome were reported on standard￾ized forms.
In our hospital, the virus was detected by Fluorescent PCR
(detection of viral DNA) and immunohistory (detection of viral
antibody and antigen). Viral DNA detection was used in
cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus, Epste in-Barr virus (EBV),
Human papilloma virus (HPV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Viral antibody and/or antigen detection
was used in hepatitis C virus (HCV), CMV, HBV, EBV, human
parvo-virus and HSV. For the detection of bacteria (Including
Gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria), smear and
culture were applied in sputum, blood, urine and bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid.
This was a cross-sectional study. Each patient underwent a 12-
month follow-up observation, and clinical information was
gathered from clinical observations, medical records and outpa￾tient follow-up visits. Severe patients required hospitalization and
intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Patients were monitored
monthly, and additional data collection forms were completed to
record any significant clinical events, including rejection, severe
infection and death. Demographic characteristics (gender and age
at transplantation), transplant etiology, HLA match, and clinical
outcomes were collected prospectively. The exclusion criteria were
(1) observation time less than 12 months, (2) death for other
reasons (except for various infections) within 12 months post￾transplantation, (3) discontinued use of immune suppressants due
to graft function failure, and (4) inability to provide written
informed consent. This study was performed from Jan 2008 to Dec
2012. All patients were discharged within approximately 30 days
after surgery and visited our outpatient clinics thereafter; all
patients who did not meet the exclusion criteria (n = 304) were
invited to take part in the present study.
Immunosuppression
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1.0 was given as a premedicant.
A subset of recipients used antibodies for induction therapy,
including multiclonal antibodies (ATG and ALG) and monoclonal
antibodies (basiliximab and daclizumab). Intravenous infusion of
500 mg/d methylprednisolone was applied throughout the pro￾cedure and for 2 days after the operation. The dose was then
decreased to 360 mg, 180 mg, 80 mg and 40 mg on each
subsequent day, followed by the initiation of prednisone (15–
20 mg/d) as a maintenance therapy. Triple therapy with
cyclosporine A (CsA)/tacrolimus (TAC), MMF and prednisone
was administered beginning on the third day after the operation.
The dosage of MMF was 1.0–1.5 g/d, with a weight of 60 kg as
the critical value. CsA and TAC were given at initial doses of
8 mg/kg/d and 0.2 mg/kg/d, respectively, and then adjusted
according to the plasma drug concentrations and the serum
creatinine concentrations. Acute rejection was diagnosed based on
clinical and biopsy findings using the Banff 97 working classifica￾tion for renal allograft pathology (modified) [19] as the patholog￾ical rejection criteria.
Sample collection and polymorphism genotyping
A total of 304 patients were included in this study. Peripheral
blood samples (3 ml) were collected, the DNA was extracted, and
the SNPs of CTLA4 were genotyped using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The primers and annealing
temperatures (ATs) employed for rs733618 C/T, rs4553808 A/G,
rs5742909 C/T, rs231775 A/G and rs3087243 G/A are shown in
Table S1.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of clinical characteristics between patients with
and without infection were analyzed by the Pearson x2 test and an
independent sample test. We assessed the Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) for both infection and non-infection using
the x2 test. Haploview version 4.2 software was used to calculate
linkage disequilibrium (LD) [20]. A correlation test was used to
assay the degree of correlation between the onset of infection and
the CTLA4 genotypes of the recipients. Genotype associations were
analyzed using a dominant model (minor-allele homozygotes plus
heterozygotes vs. major-allele homozygotes) and a recessive model
(minor-allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes plus major-allele
homozygotes). The allelic frequencies were counted in a single
strand of measured DNA. The differences in the genotype
distributions between groups were analyzed by the x2 test or
Fisher’s exact test. The time to infection was designated as the
number of days post-transplantation of the first infection. The
associations between the CTLA4 SNPs and time (days) to first

infection were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier test. Multivariate
logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate several risk
factors, including age, gender, primary disease, number of HLA
mismatches, acute rejection, blood transfusion, CTLA4 SNPs and
antibody induction therapy. These risk factors were analyzed
together. We explored the haplotype associations for 5 SNPs using
Haploview version 4.2. All statistical tests were two-sided, and
statistical significance was set at p,0.05. Correction for multiple
testing was carried out using the Bonferroni method. Statistical
analysis was performed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences) version 11.5 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL,
USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics of 304 renal transplant recipients
A total of 304 patients were recruited to the study, including 192
male and 112 female cases. During the first 12 months post￾transplantation, a total of 20.07% (61/304) recipients developed
bacterial infection, 15.46% (47/304) developed viral infection,
3.62% (11/304) developed fungal infection and 1.32% (4/304)
developed another infection. The baseline characteristics of the
304 renal transplant recipients and types of infection are listed in
Table 1. No significant differences in age, sex, primary disease,
human leukocyte antigen mismatches, blood transfusion, renal
transplantation or immunosuppressant regimen were found
between patients with infection and those without (controls)
(Table 1). The incidence of acute rejection (AR) following renal
transplantation was similar in both groups. However, the groups
that suffered from bacterial infection and from viral infection were
significantly different from the control (non-infection group)
(p= 0.007 and p= 0.015).
Associations between the CTLA4 SNPS and two types of
infection
All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Using
Haploview version 4.2 software, the five loci were found to be in
linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D9 = 0.900–1.000). No significant
differences in the genotype distributions of rs733618, rs4553808,
rs5742909, rs231775 or rs3087243 were found between patients
with bacterial infection and those without bacterial infection
(Table 2). In the viral infection group, no significant differences
were found among rs733618, rs5742909, rs231775 and
rs3087243; however, the frequency of the rs4553808 GG genotype
in recipients with viral infection was significantly higher (14.89%)
than in those recipients without infection (3.50%) (p = 0.001,
OR = 4.822, 95% CI = 1.700–13.679, Bonferroni-adjusted
p= 0.005) (Table 3). No differences in the determined allelic
frequencies of rs733618, rs4553808, rs5742909, rs231775 or
rs3087243 were found between the bacterial infection cohort and
the viral infection cohort (Table 4 and Table 5).
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the relationships
between CTLA4 SNPs and bacterial or viral infection (Table S2
and Table S3); no significant differences in the genotype
frequencies of rs733618, rs4553808, rs5742909, rs231775 or
rs3087243 existed between the bacterial infection and non￾bacterial infection groups (Figure S1). A significant difference
(p= 0.001) was found between patients with the rs4553808 GG
genotype and those with the AA+AG genotypes using the log-rank
test (Figure S2) in the viral cohort. The mean and 95% CI of time

between the rs4553808 genotype and onset of viral infection was
found (p= 0.001).
To further examine the associations of infection with these
variables, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out for
the following variables: age, gender, primary disease, immuno￾suppressive regimen, blood transfusion, HLA mismatch, renal
transplantation, antibody induction therapy, acute rejection (AR)
and rs4553808 genotype (Table 6).
Multivariate analyses revealed that age, gender, primary

associated with bacterial infection. Two risk factors, the use of
antibody induction therapy (p = 0.015) and the rs4553808
genotype (p = 0.001) were associated with viral infection.
The association of CTLA4 haplotype and infection
No differences in the frequencies of nine haplotypes covering
the 5 SNPs was observed between the bacterial infection and non￾bacterial infection groups (Table 7). The frequencies of haplotypes
CGTAG and CGCAG were significantly higher in the viral
infection group (9.6% and 5.3%) than in the non-viral infection
group (3.8% and 1.4%) (p= 0.0149 and p= 0.0111). No statistically
significant differences between the viral infection and non-viral
infection groups were found for any of the remaining haplotypes
(p.0.05) (Table 8).
Discussion
In kidney transplant recipients, immunosuppressive therapy is
usually administered as a triple regimen, typically including
cyclosporine A (CsA)/tacrolimus (TAC)+mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF)+prednisone (Pred). Antibody induction therapy is used in
some recipients in cases of acute rejection. Antibody induction is
favored because it produces a more effective immunosuppression
and prolongs graft survival. However, various infections after
surgery are common due to the use of immune suppression.
In Chinese Han populations, patients carrying CTLA4+
49(rs231775) AA and A exhibited a higher frequency of chronic
HBV infection, and haplotype+49A-318C was significantly over￾represented [21]. Data indicated that the +49A allele increases the
risk of development of viral and parasitic diseases (e.g., dengue,
Chagas disease and American cutaneous leishmaniasis) but confers
resistance to autoimmune diseases (MG, PE) [22]. Ohmann et al.
[18] reported that SNP CTLA4 +49(rs231775) may be associated
with late post-transplantation viral infection in pediatric heart
recipients in the USA. For the SNP rs5742909 C/T, several
studies have shown that the CC genotype is associated with viral
disease and chronic HBV infection [23]. However, no statistically
significant associations for the SNPs rs5742909 and rs231775 were
found in the study. This lack of association may be due to the
sample size and lack of power to detect an association;
furthermore, the frequency of the G allele at the CTLA4 +49
(rs231775) locus is much higher in the Chinese population than in
other populations [24]. This may indicate that this genetic bias
does not play a significant role in infection susceptibility. A recent

(21661) AA plays a protective role in the autoimmune disease and
that the genotype GG as the risk factor for SLE. Likewise,
rs733618 (21772) TT was found to be associated with the risk of
AR following renal transplantation in our previous study [17]. Our
study revealed that the frequency of the rs4553808 GG genotype
was higher in the viral infection cohort than in the non-viral
infection group (p= 0.001). The statistical significance remained
after correction for multiple testing (correction p= 0.005). It is
likely that the rs4553808 (21661) G allele affects CTLA4
transcription by altering a putative transcription factor binding
site as rs5742909 (2318) C/T upregulates CTLA4 transcription,
resulting in the abnormal expression of CTLA4 [31].
The frequencies of the haplotypes CGTAG and CGCAG,
including the rs231775 A allele, were significantly higher in the
viral infection group than in the non-viral infection group
(p= 0.0149 and p= 0.0111).
Susceptibility factors such as age and gender are thought to
confer an increased risk for the development of infectious
complications [32]. Our multivariate analysis showed that age
and gender are not apparently susceptibility factors for the
development of infection (p= 0.250 and p = 0.448, respectively),
which contradicts some previous studies. In general, increased age
is a risk factor for infection following transplantation [32]. Women
are widely viewed as being more likely to develop infections [33].
The x2 test showed no correlation between bacterial or viral
infection and acute rejection (AR) (p= 0.059 and p= 0.839)
(Table 7). The percentage of AR recipient with bacterial infection
(32/61, 52.46%) was higher than that of non-AR recipients (95/
243, 39.09%), although this difference only approached signifi￾cance (p= 0.058). In our previous study [17], a correlation
between CTLA4 SNPs and AR was observed. That data was not
sufficient to determine whether AR is associated with a higher risk
of infection, but a multivariate analysis published by Mourad et al.
[33] this year showed that acute rejection was a risk factor for
infectious complications after renal transplantation. The associa￾tion between AR and infection in that study is statistically weak,
with a p value close to the threshold. It is possible that different
populations and other statistical biases could affect these results.
Therefore, further studies in different populations and larger
patient cohorts are needed to address this question. Patients with
biopsy-confirmed AR typically receive an intravenous steroid
bolus and antibodies, which may to some extent precipitate the
development of infection.
Multivariate analysis showed that antibody use was a risk factor
(p= 0.007) for bacterial infection and that antibody use (p= 0.015)
and recipient rs4553808 genotype (p= 0.001) were risk factors
associated with viral infection. Susceptibility factors such as
antibody induction therapy may confer an increased risk of
infection. Baek et al. [34] discovered that serious infectious
complications increased in kidney transplant recipients who were
treated with an anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab).
In conclusion, the CTLA4 haplotypes CGTAG and CGCAG
were partially associated with the development of viral infection in
Chinese kidney transplant recipients. The rs4553808 GG geno￾type may be a risk factor for viral infection in kidney
transplantation. The role of CTLA4 SNPs in infection following
renal transplantation has not been completely elucidated and
needs to be studied in greater depth.
