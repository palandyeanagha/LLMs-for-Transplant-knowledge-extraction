Abstract
The human end-stage kidney and its experimental analogue,
the remnant kidney in the rat, exhibit widespread tubulo￾interstitial disease. We investigated whether the pathogenesis
of such tubulo-interstitial injury is dependent upon adaptive
changes in tubular function and, in particular, in ammonia
production when renal mass is reduced. Dietary acid load was
reduced in 143nephrectomized rats by dietary supplementation
with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), while control rats, paired
for serum creatinine after 14 nephrectomy, were supplemented
with equimolar sodium chloride. After 4-6 wk, NaHCO3-
supplemented rats demonstrated less impairment of tubular
function as measured by urinary excretory rates for total
protein and low molecular weight protein and higher transport
maximum for para-aminohippurate per unit glomerular filtration
rate, less histologic evidence of tubulo-interstitial damage, less
deposition of complement components C3 and C5b-9, and a
lower renal vein total ammonia concentration. Such differences
in tubular function could not be accounted for simply on the
basis of systemic alkalinization, and differences in tubular
injury could not be ascribed to differences in glomerular
function. Because nitrogen nucleophiles such as ammonia react
with C3 to form a convertase for the alternative complement
pathway, and because increased tissue levels of ammonia are
associated with increased tubulo-interstitial injury, we propose
that augmented intrarenal levels of ammonia are injurious
because of activation of the alternative complement pathway.
Chemotactic and cytolytic complement components are thereby
generated, leading to tubulo-interstitial inflammation. Thus,
alkali supplementation reduces chronic tubulo-interstitial disease
in the remnant kidney of the rat, and we propose that this
results, at least in part, from reduction in cortical ammonia
and its interaction with the alternative complement pathway.
Introduction
Chronic tubulo-interstitial disease dominates the structural
disarray of the end-stage kidney in humans (1, 2), as well as
in its experimental analogue, the remnant kidney in the rat
(3, 4). These structural abnormalities are functionally significant
in that various histologic indices of tubulo-interstitial disease
correlate quite closely with levels of both hemodynamic and
tubular transport functions in a variety of human renal diseases
(1, 2). The mechanisms by which tubulo-interstitial injury

arise, and the reasons for continuing damage even in primary
glomerular diseases are unknown. Recently, support has ap￾peared for the hypothesis that adaptive changes in nephron
function underlie nephron injury: in particular, that compen￾satory increments in ultrafiltration pressure that occur in
remnant glomeruli constitute a mechanism of self-perpetuating
injury to these residual units (5-8). We questioned whether
compensatory changes in remnant tubular function with de￾clining renal mass may prove injurious to the tubulo-intersti￾tium.
Adaptive changes in ammonia production occur as func￾tional renal mass is reduced (9). Studies in human and
experimental renal disease demonstrate that, despite reductions
in total ammonia production, ammonia excretion factored for
glomerular filtration rate is increased severalfold (10-12).
Ammonia production per surviving nephron more than doubles
in rats with 70% reduction in renal mass (13). In addition,
estimates of renal cortical partial pressure of ammonia based
on direct measurement of intrarenal ammonia levels are
elevated in rats with reduced renal mass on standard diets
(14). Because ammonia has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of both renal (15-17) and extrarenal tissue injury (18), we
explored the role of ammonia in the pathogenesis of tubulo￾interstitial injury in the remnant model of chronic renal
insufficiency.
Methods
Our investigation consisted of three studies, designated studies I, II,
and III, all of which involved the use of the remnant model of chronic
renal failure in the rat. This model was made by removal of the right
kidney and segmental infarction of the left kidney under methohexithal
anesthesia (5 mg/l00 g of body weight, i.p.). Serum creatinine was
measured 3 d after nephrectomy on a Beckman Creatinine Analyzer
2, (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) from a tail vein blood
sample. In studies I and II, animals were then paired into two groups
based on serum creatinine, ensuring similar starting levels of renal
function in both groups. In these studies, the diet of the experimental
group was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to reduce
dietary acid load and to suppress ammonia production. We calculated
that 2.5 meq of bicarbonate per 10 g of food intake of a 20% powdered
protein diet (Teklad No. 170597, Teklad, Madison, WI) would exceed
the daily nonvolatile acid production yielded by such a diet. The
control group was maintained on an identical 20% powdered protein
diet but supplemented instead with equimolar sodium chloride (NaCl).
Study I was designed to compare the effect of dietary supplemen￾tation with NaHCO3 versus NaCI on the remnant kidney model 4-6
wk after 13 nephrectomy, a time when indices of renal injury, both
functional and morphologic, can be measured. Study II was performed
to assess the role of glomerular hemodynamics in renal injury in rats
supplemented with either NaHCO3 or NaCl. Micropuncture studies
were thus undertaken at I'-2 wk after subtotal nephrectomy, before
the occurrence of severe renal injury and heterogeneity of nephron
function. Study III examined the acute effects of systemic alkalosis on
renal function in subtotally nephrectomized animals.

Study I: renal function, morphology and
immunofluorescence 4-6 wk after subtotal nephrectomy
In vivo renal studies. Male rats, weighing 225-250 g and paired for
serum creatinine after 13 nephrectomy, were maintained for 4-6 wk
on a 20% protein diet supplemented with either NaHCO3 (experimental
group) or NaCI (control group). The animals had free access to food
and water. At the end of the study period, the animals were housed
separately in metabolic cages for 24 h, during which time food and
water intake was monitored and 24-h urine output was collected. Total
urinary protein excretion was assayed by the sulfosalicyclic acid
method in each animal. For quantitation of low molecular weight
protein excretion over 24 h, a urine sample from each of the animals
was filtered on a PM-10 membrane in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell
(Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) to permit the passage of proteins with
molecular weight < 10,000. For each urine sample the fraction of the
total urinary protein that comprised protein molecules < 10,000 mol
wt was measured ( 19). Using this fraction, and the total urinary protein
excretion per 24 h as determined by the sulfosalicyclic acid method
the amount of low molecular weight (<10,000 mol wt) protein excreted
over 24 h was determined.
On the morning of clearance studies, animals underwent trache￾ostomy after Inactin anesthesia (100 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.). PE￾50 polyethylene catheters were inserted into both internal jugular veins
for infusion. A PE-50 catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery
for blood sampling and for blood pressure monitoring via a Statham
pressure transducer (model P23Db, Statham Instruments, Oxnard,
CA) connected to a Gilson Duograph recorder, (model ICT-2H, Gilson
Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI). The left ureter was cathe￾terized with PE-IO tubing and urine was collected under oil. To
determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR),' a solution of normal
saline containing [methoxy-3H]inulin (10 uCi/ml) was infused at a rate
of 1.2 ml/h after a priming dose of 0.5 ml over 5 min. To assess
transport maximum for para-aminohippurate, TmPAH, a 4% solution
of para-aminohippurate (PAH) was infused at a rate of 1.2 ml/h after
a priming dose of 0.5 ml over 5 min. After allowing 45 min for
equilibration, two clearance collections were performed. Urine volume
was measured in a calibrated glass tube. Hematocrit was determined
by the Micro-Capillary Hematocrit Reader (International Equipment
Co., Needham Heights, MA) and total plasma protein concentration
by refractometry. Radioactivity in urine and plasma was determined
by liquid scintillation counting. Plasma and urine concentrations of
PAH were determined by the method of Smith et al. (20). GFR and
TmPAH were calculated by standard formulas.
After the completion of clearance studies, a sample of renal vein
blood was drawn for measurement of renal vein total ammonia
concentration. After centrifugation at 4°C, the plasma was frozen and
analyzed for total ammonia concentration by the ion-exchange resin
and Bertholet reaction method (21). A sample of aortic blood was
immediately analyzed for arterial blood gases and derived bicarbonate
by an Instrumentation Laboratory blood gas analyzer (Instrumentation
Laboratory, Inc., Waltham, MA).
Remnant kidney tissue was divided for histology and immunoflu￾orescence. Tissue for histopathology was fixed in glacial acetic acid
Zenker's solution, sectioned at 5 ,m, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. Sections were examined in a coded blinded manner with
regard to cast formation, dilatation of tubules, interstitial fibrosis and
cellular infiltrate, and the extent of glomerular sclerosis. The largest
external diameters were measured for 20 randomly selected tubules at
the cortico-medullary junction. The number of intratubular casts at
the cortico-medullary junction in a 2,500-Mm2 area were counted and
the number of casts per 1,000 tubules was derived.
For immunofluorescent studies, remnant kidney tissue was first
snap-frozen in isopentane in a dry ice/acetone bath. 4-am sections

were cut on a cryostat at -20'C, fixed in acetone, and stained by a
double antibody sandwich technique for C3, C5b-9, IgG, and albumin.
Appropriate dilutions of IgG fractions of goat anti-rat C3, goat anti￾rat IgG, and rabbit anti-rat albumin (Cappel Laboratories, Malvern,
PA) were applied to tissue sections, incubated for 60 min at 20'C in
a humidified chamber, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline. Secondary antibodies, applied in the same fashion, included
fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates of rabbit anti-goat IgG and goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel Laboratories). Rat C5b-9 was purified on Bio￾Gel A-15m (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) as a macromolecular
complex from detergent-solubilized membranes of IgG-sensitized sheep
erythrocytes after hemolysis in rat serum, according to the method of
Ware et al. (22). Antiserum to the C5b-9 complex was raised in rabbits
after three immunizations with 0.2 mg of protein complex in 0.5 ml
of complete Freund's adjuvant and was precipitated with caprylic acid
to isolate the IgG fraction for use as a primary antibody in immuno￾fluorescence.
In vitro complement studies. To assess the effects of ammonia on
the formation of amidated C3 and its activity as an alternative pathway
convertase, a standard assay for the hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes
by the alternative pathway was employed (23). 1.5-10 Ai of daily
prepared stock solutions of 20 mM or 1 M NH4CI in distilled H20
was added to 200-A&I aliquots of normal human serum for final
concentrations of 0.150, 0.250, 0.500, 1.0, and 10.0 mM NH4Cl. After
incubation at 37°C for 3 h, control and amidated serum samples were
diluted 1:20, 1:26.6, 1:40, and 1:50 with a standard solution of 0.0025
M magnesium chloride, 0.075 M NaCl, 0.01 M EGTA, 0.14 M D￾glucose, 0.1% gelatin, and 0.01 M veronal (pH 7.5), held at 40C for
15 min to chelate calcium, and incubated with 2.5 X 107 rabbit
erythrocytes for 60 min in a 37°C water bath. At the end of the
incubation period, 4.0 ml of 0.15 M NaCl was added to each specimen,
and the degree of hemolysis was assessed spectrophotometrically as the
optical density at 414 nm. For each experiment, hemolytic controls
consisted of 200 Ml of serum without NH4CI (base-line control), buffer
alone, and buffer with NH4Cl in concentrations ranging from 0.150 to
10 mM.
Study II: glomerular function as assessed
by micropuncture 12 wk after subtotal nephrectomy
Male Munich-Wistar rats, 13 nephrectomized, weighing 210-325 g and
paired into two groups on the basis of serum creatinine as described,
were maintained on NaHCO3- or NaCl-supplemented 20% protein
diets for 1-2 wk. On the morning of micropuncture, rats were
anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.), and were
prepared for micropuncture. At the beginning of each experiment, an
arterial blood sample was taken for the determination of background
counts, hematocrit, and total protein. All animals were infused with
isoncotic rat plasma equal to 1% of body weight to replace surgical
losses and maintain constancy of initial hematocrit. To determine
GFR and single nephron glomerular filtration rates (SNGFR), normal
saline containing [methoxk-3H]inulin (100 MCi/ml) was infused at a
rate of 1.2 ml/h after a priming dose of 0.5 ml given over 5 min.
Timed samples of proximal tubular fluid were obtained by micro￾puncture from random proximal surface convolutions for determination
of total radioactivity. To obtain renal venous samples, a 23-gauge
needle connected to a tuberculin syringe by PE-50 tubing was inserted
in the left renal vein. Filtration fraction was calculated from the
extraction of inulin. Hydraulic pressure measurements were made in
cortical tubules, cortical vessels, and glomerular capillaries of surface
glomeruli by the servo-null micropipette technique. SNGFR, filtration
fraction, initial glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA), and the
mean transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient (AP) were calculated
by standard formulas.
Study III: effect ofsystemic alkalosis on renal function
in subtotally nephrectomized rats
Subtotally nephrectomized male rats, weighing 250-275 g, were main￾tained on a 20% protein diet and water ad libitum for 2-3 wk.

Determinations of GFR, TmPAH, and TmPAH/GFR were then
performed by clearance techniques as described (see above, study I).
After basal clearance determinations, a solution containing 125 mM
NaHCO3 and 15 mM KHCO3 was infused, at a rate of -15% body
weight/hour for a duration of 20 min. Clearance of inulin and PAH
was repeated after the infusion. A sample of aortic blood was taken at
the end of the last clearance period for determination of arterial blood
gases and derived bicarbonate. Concentration of albumin in urine
samples obtained during the clearance study was measured by rate
nephelometry using the Beckman Immunochemistry Analyzer (Beck￾man Instruments, Ihc.). Goat-derived anti-rat albumin (Cappel Labo￾ratories) was used to generate the antigen-antibody reaction for this
measurement.
Study IV: effect ofgenetic deficiency ofcomplement
component C5 on proteinuria in subtotally
nephrectomized mice
Mice sufficient (BlO.D2NSN) and deficient (BIO.D20SN) for the fifth
component of complement (CS) were obtained from Jackson Labora￾tories (Bar Harbor, ME). Adult male mice of each strain were subjected
to partial renal ablation by right nephrectomy and infarction of
approximately one-third of the remaining kidney by ligation of the
single segmental renal artery. The mice were allowed ad libitum access
to the same diets. They were placed in metabolic cages before and at
regular intervals after the ablative procedure. 24-h urines were collected
for measurement of total protein as described above.
Statistics
Data are presented as means±standard errors. The Student's t test was
used to assess statistical significance; differences were considered statis￾tically significant for P < 0.05.
Results
Study I
In vivo renal studies. After 4-6 wk both NaHCO3- and NaCI￾supplemented rats appeared healthy. There was no difference
in mean body weight, food intake over 24 h, total plasma
protein concentration, or hematocrit (Table I).
Total urinary protein excretion in NaHCO3-supplemented
rats, 41±13 mg/24 h, was almost half that of the NaCl￾supplemented rats, which was 74±16 mg/24 h (P < 0.05)
(Table II). Similarly, urinary excretion of low molecular weight
proteins (mol wt < 10,000) in NaHCO3-supplemented rats,
14±3 mg/24 h, was diminished by 50% as compared to 28±8
mg/24 h, in NaCI-supplemented rats (P < 0.02). Thus, protein
excretion rates suggested less renal injury in NaHCO3-supple￾mented rats as compared to NaCl-supplemented rats and the
decreased urinary excretion of low molecular weight protein

suggested preservation in tubular functional capacity to reabsorb
low molecular weight proteins. There was no difference in
GFR in NaHCO3- versus NaCI-supplemented rats. TmPAH
in NaHCO3-supplemented rats, 113±24 jg/min, was higher
than in NaCI-supplemented rats, 73±16 ,sg/min, although this
difference did not attain statistical significance. However,
TmPAH/GFR in NaHCO3 rats, 250±30 gg/ml, was signifi￾cantly higher (P < 0.05) than in NaCl rats, measured at
140±30 ,ug/ml. Hence, per unit glomerular filtration rate,
NaHCO3-supplemented rats demonstrated greater ability to
secrete PAH.
Plasma chemistries demonstrated a statistically higher
plasma bicarbonate concentration in NaHCO3-supplemented
rats, 31±0.7 meq/liter, as compared to NaCI-supplemented
rats, 20.4±1.6 meq/liter (P < 0.01). Mean renal vein total
ammonia concentration in NaHCO3-supplemented rats,
145±20 AM, was lower than in NaCl rats, 240±20 MM (P
< 0.05). Thus, supplementation of the 20% protein diet with
NaHCO3 achieved a lower renal vein ammonia concentration
in conjunction with systemic alkalinization.
Analysis by light microscopy demonstrated fewer intratu￾bular casts in NaHCO3 rats, measured at 5±2 casts per 1,000
tubules at the corticomedullary junction as compared to 23±8
intratubular casts per 1,000 tubules in NaCl-supplemented rats
(P < 0.05). Moreover, interstitial infiltration and tubular dilation
and atrophy were less pronounced in NaHCO3-supplemented
rats as compared to NaCl rats (Fig. 1). Mean external tubular
diameter, was 35±3.2 gm in NaHCO3-supplemented rats and
42±3.8 ,om in NaCl-supplemented rats (0.05 < P < 0.1). Hence,
less severe histologic evidence of tubulo-interstitial injury
occurred in conjunction with less damage to tubular transport
functions of organic anion secretion and protein reabsorption
in rats with lower renal venous levels of ammonia.
Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated markedly different
patterns in the remnant kidney of NaCl-supplemented versus
NaHCO3-supplemented rats (Fig. 2). In NaCl-supplemented
rats, there was widespread circumferential fluorescence for C3,
whereas in NaHCO3-supplemented rats, peritubular immuno￾fluorescence was much reduced. C5b-9 was also found to be
diffusely deposited in a more granular but circumferential
peritubular pattern in NaCl rats, whereas in the NaHCO3-
supplemented rats there was again marked diminution of such
deposition. Peritubular immunofluorescence for IgG and al￾bumin was absent for all rats of both groups. Thus, the
peritubular deposition of complement components appears

unique and is not the consequence of nonspecific deposition
of macromolecules.
In vitro complement studies. Titration of hemolytic activity
in control samples and in samples containing increasing con￾centrations of NH4Cl (range 0.150-10 mM) revealed a biphasic
effect of the presence of ammonia on the hemolytic activity
of normal human serum (Fig. 3). In comparison to the control
samples, the presence of 0.150 mM NH4Cl in serum led to a
tendency to increased hemolytic activity over baseline, whereas
0.250 mM NH4Cl caused an even greater increase in hemolytic
activity (P < 0.05). No hemolysis was observed when rabbit
erythrocytes were incubated with 0.150-10 mM NH4Cl in the
absence of serum.
At concentrations > 0.500 mM NH4Cl, however, hemolytic
activity of amidated serum samples fell below that of control
samples and was significantly different from base-line values
at concentrations of 1.0 and 10 mM NH4Cl (P < 0.05 and
0.001, respectively).
Micropuncture studies were performed I' 2 wk after subtotal
nephrectomy. Results are summarized in Table III. Both
NaHCO3- and NaCl-supplemented rats had comparable body
weights, total plasma protein concentrations, hematocrits, mean
arterial pressures, and GFR. Glomerular hemodynamics were
remarkably similar in that there was no statistical difference
in SNGFR, QA, and AP (Table III). Thus, although there was
evidence of glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion in
both the NaHCO3- and NaCl-supplemented rats, the extent to
which glomerular pressures and flows were augmented was
not different in these two groups.
Study III
Results are summarized in Table IV. Mean plasma bicarbonate
concentration achieved after NaHCO3-supplemented infusion
was 38±3 meq/liter. There was no statistical difference in basal
rates of albumin excretion and basal TmPAH/GFR as com￾pared to values for these parameters after plasma bicarbonate
levels were elevated (Table IV). Thus differences in rates of
protein excretion and tubular function as assessed by TmPAH/
GFR are not attributed simply to systemic alkalinization or to
elevation of plasma bicarbonate concentration.
Study IV
Mice sufficient or deficient for the fifth component of comple￾ment were studied by measurements of 24-h excretion of total
protein before and after subtotal nephrectomy. As demonstrated
in Table V, animals with deficiency of the fifth component of
complement, had a tendency to lower protein excretions even
before nephrectomy, however, this difference was not of statis￾tical significance. For the first 20 wk after subtotal nephrectomy,
this tendency for slightly greater proteinuria persisted though
the rate did not change within either sufficient or deficient
groups. At the 30th week after partial renal ablation, both
groups demonstrated increased protein excretion and to a
substantially greater degree in the sufficient animals.
Discussion
With chronic progressive renal disease, structural abnormalities
increasingly envelop the tubulo-interstitial and glomerular
compartments of the kidney (1, 2). The process culminates in
the typical architectural disarray of the end-stage kidney in
which the interstitium is invaded by cellular infiltration and
fibrosis; tubules become atrophic and dilated and are frequently
filled with casts; and glomeruli are transformed into partially
or totally sclerosed tufts (1, 2). Such structural changes are of
functional significance for both glomerular and tubulo-inter￾stitial diseases; histologic evidence of tubulo-interstitial abnor￾malities correlates closely with the decline in such indices of
renal function as GFR, renal plasma flow, concentrating
ability, and the ability to maximally acidify the urine (1, 2,
24, 25).
With loss of renal mass, tubular adaptation in the handling
of solutes and water occurs. Our study focuses on the adaptive
changes in acid excretion in general and ammonia production
in particular. In human and experimental chronic renal disease,
total urinary ammonium excretion decreases (10, 11). However,
when corrected for GFR, ammonium excretion increases several
fold above control values (10-12). Studies in rats subjected to
70% reduction of renal mass have demonstrated that ammo￾670 K. A. Nath, M. K. Hostetter, and T. H. Hostetter

Figure 2. Sections of the remnant kidney examined by immunofluo￾rescence for complement proteins C3 and C5b9. NaCl-supplemented
rats (A, C, E) display circumferential peritubular staining for C3 at
nium production per nephron more than doubles (13), a
finding corroborated by the demonstration of increased am￾monia production from its major metabolic source, glutamine,
by renal cortical slices taken from the remnant kidney (12).
Thus adaptive increments in ammonia production occur with
reduced renal mass. Micropuncture analysis in the remnant
kidney has localized this increased production principally to
the proximal tubule (14), the same site where the bulk of

ammonia production occurs in the normal animal (26). In
addition, calculation of renal cortical levels of ammonia has
revealed significant elevations in the cortex of the remnant
kidney (14), presumably the result of augmented ammonia￾genesis out of proportion to rates of removal.
Our data demonstrate that in NaHCO3-supplemented rats,
with a mean HCO- intake per day of 2.8 meq, the plasma
HCO- was significantly elevated and the renal venous total

ammonia concentration was significantly reduced from control
values. Systemic alkalinization was sustained in these rats
presumably because of the reduction in GFR induced by
ablation (27). Based on the data of Schoolwerth et al. (12), we
have calculated that rats would excrete 1 meq of ammonium
and 1.3 meq total acid per day on a 20% protein diet. Thus
the mean intake of 2.8 meq of HCO- should more than match
the acid load that the kidney is called upon to excrete and
thereby lead to net negative acid loads. The finding of systemic
alkalosis is consistent with this calculation. By buffering the
dietary acid load, bicarbonate supplementation would be ex￾pected to diminish the adaptive increases in ammonia produc￾tion, and thereby decrease the tissue levels of ammonia. In
NaHCO3-supplemented rats, renal cortical ammonia levels, as
indicated by renal vein total ammonia concentration (28),
were reduced.
NaHCO3-supplemented rats also exhibit less tubule-inter￾stitial disease as demonstrated by three lines of evidence. (a)

Histologic analysis revealed fewer intratubular casts at the
cortico-medullary junction, reduced interstitial infiltration and
fibrosis, and less tubular atrophy and dilatation in NaHCO3-
supplemented rats. (b) TmPAH/GFR, a widely used marker
of tubular function in health and disease (29, 30), is increased
in NaHCO3-supplemented rats. Such an increase in TmPAH￾GFR cannot be ascribed to differences between NaHCO3 and
NaCl-treated rats in terms of urinary flow rates, plasma protein
concentration, or the effect of systemic alkalinization. Thus,
the higher TmPAH/GFR in NaHCO3-supplemented rats in￾dicates a greater functional capacity for organic ion secretion
by the renal tubule in the remnant kidney. (c) NaHCO3 rats
exhibit less urinary excretory rates for total protein and low
molecular weight protein. It is unlikely that the differences in
urinary total protein excretion derive entirely from differences
in glomerular injury. Rather, we contend that differences in
urinary excretion protein reflect differences in tubular handling
of filtered protein, a contention directly supported by lower
urinary excretion rates of low molecular weight protein in
NaHCO3 rats. Tubulo-interstitial injury impairs the capacity
of the proximal tubule to catabolize low molecular weight
protein, either by intraluminal enzymic degradation or by
endocytosis, thus allowing these molecules to escape degradation
and be excreted in the urine. Thus, the finding of decreased
urinary excretion rate of low molecular weight and total
protein in NaHCO3 rats indicates greater preservation of

tubular function of protein reabsorption and/or degradation.
In addition, micropuncture studies performed 10-14 d post￾ablation revealed that glomerular pressures and flows were
augmented to the same degree in NaHCO3- and NaCl-treated
rats. Thus, the severity of glomerular damage, sustained on a
hemodynamic basis, predictably, should be similar in both
groups.
We propose that ammonia reacts biochemically with the
third component of complement to promote tubulo-interstitial
injury. Peritubular deposition of complement proteins has
been observed in a wide variety of chronic human renal
disease, both nephritic and nonnephritic (31). As demonstrated
in several experimental models ofglomerulonephritis, antigen￾antibody complexes at the glomerular basement membrane
trigger the classical complement pathway, and its component
proteins, including C3 and C5b-9, are deposited in the glo￾merulus (32, 33). For nonnephritic diseases, antigen-antibody
complexes that activate the classical pathway are not present,
and the mechanism by which complement proteins are depos￾ited about the tubules is unknown (31).
The remnant kidney in the rat provides one such model
of nonnephritic renal disease (6). Evidence implicating the
classic agents of immune renal injury, such as antibasement
membrane antibody, is lacking (8, 34). However, our studies
in the subtotally nephrectomized rat, chronically maintained
on an NaCl-supplemented diet, demonstrate a pattern of
peritubular deposition of complement components similar to
that described by Falk et al. (31) in a variety of human renal
diseases. In our model, this peritubular deposition of both C3
and C5b-9 is diminished by NaHCO3 supplementation. Neither
IgG nor albumin is observed in the peritubular area in either
group of animals. Thus the difference in peritubular deposition
of complement is not a consequence of nonspecific trapping
of macromolecules. The marked reduction in the amount of
C3 deposited in NaHCO3-treated rats is also associated with
decreased tubulo-interstitial injury and lower renal cortical
levels of ammonia.
The availability of animals with a single genetic defect
resulting in the absence of the fifth component of complement
allows a test of the role of the terminal complement components
in the injury sustained by the remnant nephrons. Our studies
indicate that the generation of the terminal cascade, the
membrane attack complex, is important in the development
of proteinuria in this model of chronic renal insufficiency.
Although these studies do not distinguish between glomerular
and tubulo-interstitial disease engendered by terminal comple￾ment components, they do support the view that in this model
the presence of an intact terminal complement pathway is
important in the resultant net renal injury.
We propose that lowering the renal cortical ammonia level
leads to diminished deposition of C3 by reducing the reaction
of ammonia with the reactive thiolester bond of C3. Interest￾ingly, 25 yr ago, Beeson and Rowley (35) described an "anti￾complementary effect of kidney tissue" in a rat model of
coliform pyelonephritis and presented evidence that ammonia
produced in the kidney attacked plasma complement proteins.
More recently, the biochemistry of this reaction has been
rigorously explored in vitro (36-38).
The molecular structure of C3 consists of two polypeptide
chains, a and ,B. A conserved sequence of seven amino acids
in the chain-Gly-Cys-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asn-Met-forms a macro￾cyclic ring in which resides the reactive thiolester bond of C3.
Nucleophilic amines, such as ammonia, attack the thiolester
directly, breaking the bond and forming an amide linkage at
the glutamyl carbonyl (37). This reaction is stoichiometric and
specific only for the second glutamyl carbonyl: the amidated
thiolester peptide has been sequenced for confirmation (39).
The modification of C3 by nucleophiles such as methyl￾amine confers C3b-like properties including the ability to form
the alternative pathway convertase (40-42). To assess the
effects of free-base ammonia on the formation of amidated C3
and its activity as an alternative pathway convertase, we
compared hemolytic activity of normal human serum with
that of serum samples containing increasing concentrations of
NH4Cl (range 0.150-10 mM) by using a standard assay for
the hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes by the alternative pathway
(Fig. 3).
It was not surprising that concentrations of NH4CI > 1
mM depressed the hemolytic activity of normal serum. Tack
and colleagues (37) were the first to observe that 10 mM
methylamine reduced by 50% the hemolytic activity of human
C3, and these experiments were subsequently confirmed with
other nucleophiles (38, 39). Thus in our assay at concentrations
of NH4Cl > 1 mM, the accelerated formation of the enzymatic
convertase (amidated C3) depletes its substrate (native C3)
which alone is hemolytically active.
We, however, are the first to observe the stimulation of
alternative pathway activity at lower concentrations, a range
not studied in earlier papers. The physiologic importance of
our observations is that, at the concentrations of ammonia
measured in the kidneys of the experimental animals, the
activity of the alternative pathway is amplified beyond that
observed in the absence of ammonia. Amidated C3 thus forms
the C3/C5 convertase of the alternative pathway and cleaves
both unreacted C3, which can then bind directly to carbohy￾drates or amino groups on cell surfaces (39, 43) as well as C5,
generating the chemoattractant CSa and triggering the assembly
of the membrane attack complex, COb-9. Moreover, we have
recently shown that amidated C3 binds to the CR1 receptor
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes and stimulates
phagocytic oxidative metabolism (42). Thus, the rise in intra￾renal ammonia concentration engendered by the adaptation
to chronic renal disease determines attendant immunologic
effects. Because ammonia reacts directly with C3 while in the
fluid phase (39, 44), the formation of amidated C3 is sufficient
in itself to trigger the alternative complement pathway, to
mediate the peritubular deposition of C3 and C5b-9, and to
generate multiple molecular mediators of tissue injury.
While our data and hypothesis focus on complement￾mediated tubulo-interstitial injury and the degree to which it
is influenced by ambient ammonia levels, other changes oc￾curring with systemic alkalinization may underlie some of the
structural and functional differences between NaHCO3 and
NaCI rats. A higher urinary pH in conjunction with less
proteinuria might inhibit intratubular cast formation, which
in turn may diminish tubular injury. Also, the role of hyper￾bicarbonatemia per se in protecting remnant nephron against
functional and structural injury is unknown. We demonstrate,
however, that augmented PAH transport in NaHCO3-treated
rats is not simply a consequence of systemic alkalosis, in that
acute alkalinization failed to significantly raise TmPAH/GFR.
However, it is conceivable that other chronic effects of alkalin￾ization may have contributed to these results. Finally, our
concern that systemic alkalinization may induce greater negative

charge on circulating plasma protein and/or the glomerular
filtration barrier and thereby reduce the degree of proteinuria,
led us to study the effect of acute systemic alkalinization on
protein excretion in the remnant rat kidney (45, 46). Again,
no significant differences occurred in albumin excretory rates.
We suspect that the lack of effect of acute alkalinization in
remnant kidneys may be due to the overriding influence of
already established size and charge permselective defects in
remnant glomeruli (8). Furthermore, the differences in excretory
rate of low molecular weight proteins argues for a difference
in tubular absorption. However, the extent to which charge
permselective defects in remnant glomeruli might also be
improved by chronic alkalinization remains uncertain.
Our studies on dietary supplementation with NaHCO3 in
rats with remnant kidneys demonstrate lower tissue levels of
ammonia, less deposition of complement components and a
diminution of tubulo-interstitial damage, both functionally as
well as structurally. On the basis of these findings, we propose
the following mechanism for ongoing tubulo-interstitial injury
in the progression of chronic renal disease. First, tubular
hyperfunction occurs in response to a reduction in renal mass.
In remnant nephrons increased ammoniagenesis then super￾venes, with increased renal concentration of ammonia. Local
toxic and inflammatory effects of ammonia include the trig￾gering of the alternative complement pathway by the reaction
of ammonia with the C3 thiolester, culminating in the depo￾sition of complement proteins and in the initiation of comple￾ment-mediated cellular infiltration and tissue injury. Tubular
function is thereby further impaired, fueling a self-perpetuating
cycle of adaptation and injury.
