ABSTRACT
Objective Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterised by
overwhelming hepatocyte death and liver inflammation
with massive infiltration of myeloid cells in necrotic
areas. The mechanisms underlying resolution of acute
hepatic inflammation are largely unknown. Here, we
aimed to investigate the impact of Mer tyrosine kinase
(MerTK) during ALF and also examine how the
microenvironmental mediator, secretory leucocyte
protease inhibitor (SLPI), governs this response.
Design Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry,
confocal imaging and gene expression analyses
determined the phenotype, functional/transcriptomic
profile and tissue topography of MerTK+ monocytes/
macrophages in ALF, healthy and disease controls. The
temporal evolution of macrophage MerTK expression and
its impact on resolution was examined in APAP-induced
acute liver injury using wild-type (WT) and Mer-deficient
(Mer−/−) mice. SLPI effects on hepatic myeloid cells were
determined in vitro and in vivo using APAP-treated WT
mice.
Results We demonstrate a significant expansion of
resolution-like MerTK+HLA-DRhigh cells in circulatory and
tissue compartments of patients with ALF. Compared
with WT mice which show an increase of MerTK
+MHCIIhigh macrophages during the resolution phase in
ALF, APAP-treated Mer−/− mice exhibit persistent liver
injury and inflammation, characterised by a decreased
proportion of resident Kupffer cells and increased
number of neutrophils. Both in vitro and in APAP-treated
mice, SLPI reprogrammes myeloid cells towards
resolution responses through induction of a MerTK+HLA￾DRhigh phenotype which promotes neutrophil apoptosis
and their subsequent clearance.
Conclusions We identify a hepatoprotective, MerTK+,
macrophage phenotype that evolves during the
resolution phase following ALF and represents a novel
immunotherapeutic target to promote resolution
responses following acute liver injury.

Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Liver inflammation is central to the
pathogenesis of acute liver failure (ALF) where
infiltration of myeloid cells in areas of hepatic
necrosis is contrasted by systemic immune cell
depletion and dysregulation.
▸ Mer tyrosine kinase ( MerTK) regulates innate
immune responses and promotes the clearance
of apoptotic cells following acute tissue injury.
▸ Secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is
produced within the inflamed liver in ALF and
is a key modulator of monocyte
anti-inflammatory responses.
What are the new findings?
▸ Patients with ALF have an expansion of
resolution-like MerTK+HLA-DRhigh monocytes
and hepatic macrophages, characterised by
suppressed innate and enhanced efferocytic/
phagocytic responses.
▸ MerTK+ monocytes exhibit a distinct pattern of
adhesion, phagocytosis, pattern-recognition,
and cytokine receptors and genes associated
with antigen presentation and macrophage
polarisation.
▸ A similar phenotype (MerTK+MHCIIhigh) with
enhanced phagocytic capabilites evolves during
the resolution phase of APAP-induced acute
liver injury in mice.
▸ MerTK-deficient mice exhibit persistent liver
injury and inflammation after APAP overdose
and are characterised by a depletion in
MHCIIhigh-bearing prorestorative resident
Kupffer cells and by increased numbers of
activated neutrophils.
▸ SLPI reprogrammes myeloid cells towards
resolution responses by inducing the
prorestorative MerTK+HLA-DRhigh phenotype
which promotes neutrophil apoptosis and their
subsequent clearance.

leading to jaundice, encephalopathy and multiorgan dysfunc￾tion.1 Drug-induced liver injury, particularly acetaminophen
(APAP)-induced ALF (AALF), is the most common cause of
ALF, and despite liver transplantation as an option it has a high
mortality rate.1 Although the inciting event in ALF is hepatocel￾lular death, mortality is a consequence of activation of systemic
inflammatory responses (SIRS) and its attendant complications
of multi-organ failure and recurrent infection, generated by
uncontrolled immune-mediated liver injury.2 3
Central to the pathogenesis of ALF is liver inflammation
where the infiltration of myeloid cells in areas of centrilobular
necrosis is contrasted by immune cell depletion and dysregula￾tion.4 Due to their inherent plasticity, monocytes/macrophages
execute diverse functions during tissue inflammation, at both
initiation and resolution phases, and exist in numerous activa￾tion states influenced by different microenvironmental cues.5 At
steady state, monocytes traffic to the liver, augmenting the local
macrophage pool, a process that is markedly increased during
ALF.6 7 Patients with ALF exhibit an expansion of hepatic macro￾phages, localised in areas of necrosis, through chemokine￾dependent recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages
(MoMF) and proliferation of resident Kupffer cells (KCs).4 6–10
Studies in humans and mice indicate that hepatic macrophages
orchestrate both tissue-destructive and resolution/repair responses
following acute liver injury.4 6 10 11 Both resident KCs and MoMF
populations are important effectors of resolution/tissue-repair pro￾cesses following acute liver injury, where, in the absence of both
or either of these phagocytes, there is significantly impaired recov￾ery and clearance of intrahepatic neutrophils.6 7 12 13 14
Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) is a member of the Tyro3-Axl￾MerTK (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases expressed
predominantly on macrophages.15 Following acute tissue injury,
MerTK dampens innate immune responses and promotes clear￾ance (efferocytosis) of apoptotic cells.15 Engagement and activa￾tion of MerTK inhibit signalling pathways triggered by cytokines
and toll-like receptor ligands through suppressor of cytokine sig￾naling protein (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 signalling.16 MerTK recog￾nises the exposed phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic
cells, in association with its ligands (Gas-6 and Galectin-3), while
their efferocytosis induces a monocyte/macrophage functional
switch towards resolution–tissue repair responses.17
Secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a small
protein (11.7 kDa) secreted by epithelial and myeloid cells that
can suppress monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory responses
through inhibition of NF-κB signalling.18–21 SLPI is shown to
exert immune-modulatory activities during tissue inflammation
in a variety of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, asthma and
cancer.22 We recently identified SLPI, secreted in the liver by
biliary epithelial cells and hepatic macrophages, as a modulator of
circulating monocyte function in human ALF.11 In this study, we
used a combination of human and murine experimental models
in order to investigate the role of MerTK during resolution
following acute liver injury and examine how SLPI, as a prore￾solving mediator, governs this immunological response in ALF.
METHODS
Patients
Patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF (AALF, n=23) and
non-acetaminophen induced ALF (NAALF, n=9) were recruited
to the study within 24 hours following admission to the Liver
Intensive Care Unit of King’s College Hospital (London, UK).
Inpatients with chronic liver disease (CLD, n=10) and healthy
volunteers (HC, n=15) served as pathological and healthy con￾trols. Exclusion criteria: age <18 or >65 years, neoplasia and
immunosuppressive therapy; patients were identified for emer￾gency transplantation according to King’s College Hospital (KCH)
criteria.23 The study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service (NRES) Health Research Authority (12/LO/0167).
All diseased (06/Q2708/11) and normal (06/Q2702/61) liver tissue
and blood samples (04/Q2708/41) were obtained through the
Liver Unit of Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Birmingham, UK) after
local ethics committee approval and patient consent. Clinical,
haematological and biochemical parameters were determined on a
haematological analyser (Siemens Advia 2120, Berks, UK).
Mice
All animal experiments were conducted with approval by the
Home Office and local ethics committees (PPL 70/7578).
B6.129-MerTKtm1Gr1/J (Mer−/−
) and wild-type (WT) mice with an
identical background (B6.129SF2/J) were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory. WT and Mer−/− mice were age-matched and
sex-matched (male, 8–10-week-old) for the experiments. Mice
fasted overnight received an intraperitoneal injection of APAP
(300 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or saline and were studied at
several time points. SLPI administration in APAP mice. WT mice
(male, 8–10-week-old, C57BL/6J) fasted overnight and received an
intraperitoneal injection of APAP or recombinant human (rh)-SLPI
(16.5 mg/kg) (R&D Systems, UK) or both based on the SLPI
plasma levels (8 hours post APAP) (see online supplementary
methods 1). Mice sacrificed at 24 or 48 hours received a second
SLPI intraperitoneal injection at 8 hours, while mice sacrificed at
48 hours received a third SLPI intraperitoneal injection at 24 hours.
Flow cytometry
Human monocytes and liver-derived macrophages were pheno￾typically characterised using flow cytometry on a fluorescence￾activated cell sorting (FACS) Canto II analyser (BD Biosciences,
UK), and data were analysed with FlowJo 10.1 software
(Treestar, Ashland, OR). Murine liver-derived macrophages were
phenotypically characterised using flow cytometry on an LSR
Fortessa analyser (BD Biosciences, UK), and data were analysed
with Flowlogic 600.0A software (Inivai Technologies) (see
online supplementary methods 2–4).
Gene expression analysis
Gene expression analysis was performed using the NanoString
nCounter GX Human Immunology V2 assay (NanoString
Technologies, Seattle, Washington, USA) profiling 594
immunology-related genes on FACS-separated cells (see online
supplementary methods 5). The differential gene expression
among subsets was calculated and plotted as heat map using the
nSolver Analysis Software V.3.0 (NanoString Technologies,
Seattle, Washington, USA). Statistically relevant results are con￾sidered with p<0.05 and a fold-change of 50% higher or lower.
Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ SLPI is a pivotal proresolving mediator in ALF that promotes
MerTK-dependent hepatic resolution responses following
acute liver injury.
▸ Harnessing the prorestorative capabilities of MerTK+ cells
represents a novel therapeutic strategy to promote resolution
following acute hepatic inflammmtory disorders.

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem
mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) of acetaminophen and
metabolites in mouse plasma
Mouse plasma samples were analysed for acetaminophen
(APAP) and five metabolites (APAP-glucuronide, APAP-sulfate,
APAP-cysteinyl, APAP-glutathione and APAP-N-acetylcysteinyl),
as detailed (see online supplementary methods 6). Samples,
deproteinised via solvent precipitation, were analysed by
reversed-phase gradient chromatography on an Acquity Ultra
Performance Liquid Chromatography system (Waters
Corporation, Manchester, UK) with selective detection via MS/
MS, in positive electrospray ionisation mode, via a Waters Xevo
tandem quadruple (TQ)-S mass spectrometer. Quantification of
each compound was relative to an appropriate deuterated
internal standard (see online supplementary methods 6).
Tissue sampling and imaging
Human liver tissue was obtained from patients with ALF
(n=14) undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation,4 diseased
liver tissue from patients with CLD (n=10), while normal liver
(NL, n=6) tissue was derived from hepatic resection margins of
colorectal malignancies. For phenotyping of macrophages,
mononuclear cells were freshly isolated from ALF (n=8), CLD
(n=10) and NL (n=6) liver tissue. For immunohistochemistry
(IHC), liver and mesenteric lymph node tissues were obtained
from ALF (n=6) and hepatic resections, serving as pathological
controls (n=4). Single/double epitope enzymatic IHC on forma￾lin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was performed to
assess the number of positive cells for MerTK, HLA-DR,
CD163, MPO and TUNEL. Double epitope fluorescent IHC
was used to demonstrate colocalisation by Nuance multispectral
analysis and confocal microscopy (see online supplementary
methods 7).
Cell culture and functional assays
SLPI effects were determined on cells cultured with (rh)-SLPI (0
and 0.5 μg/mL) (R&D Systems, UK). Cells were analysed for
their phenotype and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
(100 ng/mL) cytokine levels using flow cytometry and ELISA.
SLPI effects on (a) monocyte migration and efferocytosis and
(b) neutrophil oxidative burst and extracellular trap (NET) for￾mation were also assessed; for blocking experiments, culture
supernatants were preincubated with anti-SLPI antibody
(α-SLPI) (R&D Systems, UK)11 (see online supplementary
methods 8–14).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California).
Statistical significance was assessed with non-parametric ana￾lyses, and results are presented as median with IQR, unless
otherwise specified in figure legends.
RESULTS
Resolution-like MerTK+ monocytes and hepatic
macrophages are expanded in ALF
Using flow cytometry, we assessed the phenotype of both circu￾lating monocytes and hepatic macrophages, freshly isolated
from human explant tissue, in ALF, CLD and HC. Patients with
ALF exhibit a marked increase in the proportion of MerTK+
cells, when compared with HC and CLD (table 1 and figure 1A,
B). Patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF (AALF) show a
higher percentage of MerTK+ monocytes, physiological and
biochemical indices of disease severity, compared with those
with non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (NAALF) (table 2).
MerTK+ cells correlated positively with SIRS score (r=0.47;
p<0.01), AST (r=0.45; p<0.01), international normalised ratio
(r=0.37; p<0.01), heart rate (r=0.36; p<0.05), and negatively
with bilirubin (r=−0.4; p<0.05), mean arterial pressure (r=
−0.49; p<0.01) and monocyte count (r=−0.47; p<0.01).
In line with previous data,24 MerTK+ cells in ALF are charac￾terised by a resolution-like HLA-DRhighCD163highTie-2high
immunophenotype compared with CLD and HC (figure 1C).
Peak levels of MerTK+HLA-DRhigh cells are detected on admis￾sion to the Liver Intensive Care Unit (figure 1D), which subse￾quently decline to levels similar to HC by day 3–5. In contrast
to HC and CLD groups, MerTK+HLA-DRlow cells are detected
and significantly elevated in circulatory and tissue comparments
in patients with ALF and remain persistently elevated following
their admission (figure 1D and see online supplementary figure
S2A,B). Analyses of MerTK+ cells based upon their HLA-DR
expression identify key differences in their functional profile.
Compared with HC and MerTK+HLA-DRlow cells, MerTK
+HLA-DRhigh cells have an enhanced clearance of apoptotic
(CMFDA+ Annexin-Vhigh neutrophils) and infective (pHrodo
E. coli BioParticles) material, with attenuated secretion of

Gene expression profile of MerTK+ monocytes in ALF
To fully characterise the MerTK+ population in ALF, we per￾formed FACS-sorting of MerTK± monocytes from HC and
ALF (figure 2A) and subjected these cells to a quantitative gene
expression array. Compared with MerTK−, MerTK+ mono￾cytes at steady state (figure 2B, C), and in ALF (see online
supplementary figure S2), have a transcriptional profile consist￾ent with a more differentiated ‘tissue-like’ phenotype, charac￾terised by a significant upregulation of genes responsible for
adhesion (eg, ICAM2, ITGA4, ITGB1), phagocytosis/pattern￾recognition (FCGR2A/C, FCGR3A/B, MSR1, C1q), cell prolif￾eration/survival (eg, C81, LAIR1, SRC), antigen presentation
(HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA) and macrophage M2-like
polarisation (LGALS3, MARCO, MRC1, CMKLR1, CSF1R)
(figure 2B, C and see online supplementary figure S2).
Comparison of the transcriptional profile between MerTK+
monocytes in ALF and HC (figure 2D, E) revealed striking differ￾ences in line with the phenotypic and functional readouts (figure
1A–F). MerTK+ monocytes in ALF exhibit a marked reduction
in a number of regulatory pathways, notably in antigen￾processing MHC class II associated transcripts (HLA-DMA,
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA), TLR/NF-kB-dependent
proinflammatory pathway (NFKBIA, NFKBIZ, TICAM1,
TLR4, TLR8), phagocytosis/pattern-recognition (FCGR2A/C,
FCGR3A/B) and cytokines/chemokines (CCL5, PTGS2, TNF)
(figure 2D, E). Moreover, these cells maintain an M2-like skewed
profile (eg, CD163, MARCO, MRC1), activation of the down￾stream MerTK/cytokine signalling pathway (IRF3, JAK3) with a
concomitant downregulation in genes linked with cell activation
(NLRP3, SMAD3, SRC) (figure 2D, E).
MerTK+ macrophages are important in the resolution of
acute liver injury
We employed multispectral and confocal imaging to delineate
the topography and phenotype of MerTK+ macrophages in
human ALF liver tissue. Compared with pathological controls,
we confirm a numerical increase of MerTK+ cells, of mono￾cyte/macrophage lineage (CD163+), that localise to areas of
centrilobular necrosis in the ALF liver (figure 3A and see online
supplementary figure S3A). In non-acutely inflamed tissue, the
proportion of MerTK+ cells derived from infiltrating mono￾cytes (MAC387+MerTK+) was <39%. Interestingly, the pro￾portion of these circulatory derived cells was similar in ALF
explant tissue (figure 3A and see online supplementary figure
S3C). Similar to other models of sterile liver injury,25 26 we
show that these avidly phagocytic (figure 1F) MerTK
+HLA-DRhigh macrophages infiltrate and form ring-like struc￾tures around necrotic areas in the ALF liver (figure 3A).
Given our data demonstrating a marked expansion of MerTK
+ cells in human ALF, with resolution-like properties, we sought
to determine their biological relevance in acute liver injury, using
APAP-treated WT and Mer-deficient (Mer−/−) mice. First, by
applying UPLC-MS on plasma derived from both groups (base￾line vs 8 hours post APAP), we show that WT and Mer−/− mice
have no differences in APAP metabolite concentrations, indicat￾ing that the Mer−/− do not differ in their APAP metabolism (see
online supplementary figure S4). Next, we examined the tem￾poral expression and immunophenotype of MerTK+ hepatic
macrophages in WT mice (figure 3B, E). Here, we identify an
increase in the overall proportion of F4/80+CD11b+Ly6G−
MerTK+ macrophages at 24 and 48 hours after APAP adminis￾tration (figure 3B). Using established gating strategies,7 10 27 we
demonstrate that the increase in MerTK+ cells is predominantly
on the resident KC population (figure 3D). Compared with
MoMF, MerTK+ KC are characterised by a MHCclassIIhigh
Ly6Clow expression profile (figure 3D) which is associated with
highly phagocytic14 28 and prorestorative capabilities27 29 and
bears striking similarities to the MerTK+HLA-DRhigh phenotype
observed in patients with ALF (figure 1D). Thus, KC greatly con￾tribute to the increased proportion of MerTK+MHCclassIIhigh
macrophages detected at 24 and 48 hours following APAP treat￾ment (figure 3E).
However, APAP administration in Mer−/− mice resulted in a
significantly higher and persistent degree of acute liver injury,
compared with WT mice (figure 4A). Mer−/− mice had a signifi￾cantly lower proportion of F4/80+ hepatic macrophages at
steady state and following APAP dosing (figure 4B) that was
attributable to a depletion in the proportion of
MHCclassIIhighLy6Clow expressing resident KCs (figure 4B, C
and see online supplementary figure S1D). In keeping with its
role for neutrophil homeostasis and clearance,30 mice lacking
MerTK displayed a significantly higher number of activated
(MPO+) and proportion of (Ly6G+) hepatic neutrophils at
peak (8 hours) and resolution phases (24 hours) of
APAP-induced liver injury, when compared with WT mice
(figure 4D, E).

MerTK+ macrophages can be induced by the
microenvironmental mediator SLPI in vitro
Given the marked upregulation of MerTK within the ALF liver,
we sought to examine whether the key microenvironmental
mediator SLPI,11 released by monocytes/macrophages11 in ALF
(figure 1E), could be responsible for its induction. We show
that SLPI induces MerTK+HLA-DRhigh monocytes following
their transmigration across activated hepatic endothelium31
(figure 5A, B), a phenotype that is also recapitulated in human
liver-derived hepatic macrophages (figure 5C). Importantly,

activation and their subsequent clearance. We confirm that SLPI
does not directly alter neutrophil survival, TLR-evoked inflam￾matory responses and reactive oxygen species production (see
online supplementary figure 5A,B). However, in line with recent
reports,32 SLPI directly (at physiological concentrations detected
in ALF) reduced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETosis) following stimulation with either phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA) or LPS (figure 6B). To evaluate whether
MerTKhigh cells modulate neutrophil function in a paracrine
manner (figure 6C), we assessed the effects of soluble mediators
released from healthy SLPI-treated and ALF monocytes on neu￾trophils (figure 6B, D). Neutrophils cultured in supernatants
derived from SLPI-treated and ALF monocytes had a signifi￾cantly reduced survival and PMA-induced NETosis (figure 6B,
D). To determine whether the elevated SLPI levels in ALF11
could account for that, we repeated these experiments following
SLPI blockade (α-SLPI). Inhibition of SLPI’s activity in
ALF-derived monocyte supernatants restored neutrophil sur￾vival, LPS-stimulated secretion (TNF-α) and increased
PMA-evoked NETosis (figure 6E).
In addition to suppressing neutrophil activation, SLPI also
augments their clearance. Similar to MerTK+HLA-DRhigh cells
in patients with ALF (figure 1F), both SLPI-treated and
dexamethasone-treated (positive control)33 monocytes exhibited
enhanced uptake of apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis) (figure
7A, D), but not hepatocytes, when compared with untreated
cells (figure 7E-F). Together, we identify that SLPI fulfils the cri￾teria as a proresolving mediator34 in ALF through the induction
of a MerTK+HLA-DRhigh phenotype which (a) counter￾regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines while
promoting resolution/tissue-repair mediator release, (b) sup￾presses neutrophil activation and NET formation, (c) induces
neutrophil apoptosis and enhances their subsequent clearance.
SLPI induces MerTK+ macrophages in vivo and promotes
resolution following acute liver injury
We determined whether prorestorative MerTK+ macrophages
could be induced by exogenous SLPI administration in mice
using the experimental model of ALF. We found comparable
biochemical and histological indices of liver injury at 24 hours

between APAP and APAP+SLPI-treated mice (figure 8A, B).
However, SLPI administration in APAP mice led to a significant
reduction in those indices during the resolution phase (48-hour
timepoint) of APAP-induced injury (figure 8A, B). To examine
whether SLPI induces resolution-like macrophages in vivo, as
described in vitro (figure 5A–C), we determined the MerTK
expression levels of (F4/80+) hepatic macrophages at steady
state and during APAP-induced acute liver injury with/without
SLPI administration (figure 8C, D). Here, we show that SLPI
induces an increase in the (F4/80+) overall proportion of
MerTK+ macrophages at steady state (figure 8C) and at
48 hours post APAP dose (figure 8D). Furthermore, the increase
in MerTK expressing macrophages following SLPI treatment is
confined to the resident KC population (figure 8D).
In view of the data identifying the mechanisms by which SLPI
promotes neutrophil death and clearance, we also examined the

number of apoptotic neutrophils in APAP mice using immuno￾histochemistry and confocal imaging. SLPI-treated APAP mice
had a significantly lower number of MPO+ cells and higher pro￾portion of apoptotic neutrophils (MPO+TUNEL+) at 24 and
48 hours, when compared with APAP mice (figure 8E, F). Taken
together, our results reveal that during APAP-induced liver injury
in mice, SLPI administration promotes resolution responses by
imprinting a resolution-like, MerTK+, hepatic macrophage
phenotype and modulates neutrophil activation and survival.
DISCUSSION
We describe an expansion of monocytes and hepatic macro￾phages that exhibit an immune-regulatory MerTK+HLA-DRhigh
phenotype with resolution-like characteristics, detected in both
circulatory and tissue compartments of patients with ALF. We
also show that these cells infiltrate the inflamed liver and form
ring-like structures around areas of hepatic necrosis. In line with
other models of acute tissue injury,24 35–37 functional analyses
of these cells reveal that they possess suppressed innate immune

but enhanced resolution responses, typified by augmented clear￾ance of cellular/infective material and secretion of anti￾inflammatory/tissue-repair mediators (eg, SLPI) but reduced
proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α). In line with previous
data,24 comparison of gene expression profiles between MerTK
+ and MerTK− monocytes in steady state and ALF reveal that
they possess a more differentiated lineage ‘tissue-like’ profile,
with increased expression of a number of genes associated with
innate and adaptive effector functions.
Our data demonstrate marked elevations in circulating levels
of MerTK+ cells in patients with both acetaminophen-induced
and non-acetaminophen induced ALF, with highest MerTK
levels detected in patients with AALF with a greater severity of
acute liver injury and adverse clinical outcome. Peak circulating
MerTK levels are detected early on admission to our unit,
which may reflect the extent of hepatic tissue resolution
responses following acute hepatocellular necrosis. Future pro￾spective studies are warranted to assses the utility of circulating
MerTK levels as an early mechanistic biomarker of resolution
responses and outcome in patients with acute liver injury.
Our data from the experimental model for this disease are
first to provide novel insights into the origin and biological rele￾vance of these regulatory cells during acute hepatic injury. Here,
we show that the proportion of MerTK-expressing cells are spe￾cifically increased in the resident KC, and not infiltrating macro￾phage, population following APAP-induced acute liver injury.
Moreover, MerTK+ KCs bear a MHCclass IIhighLy6Clow
phenotype which is the dominant phagocytic14 28 and prores￾torative27 29 hepatic macrophage population and bears striking
similarities with the ‘prophagocytic’ MerTK+HLA-DRhigh cells
in human ALF. Furthermore, while the proportion of monocyte￾derived macrophages expressing MerTK does not substantially
increase in acute liver injury, these cells also acquire the
MHCclassIIhighLy6Clow phenotype, in line with their role in
resolving inflammation.6 7
We demonstrate that Mer-deficient mice have a reduced pro￾portion of resident KCs prior to and following APAP administra￾tion. In view of its role in promoting cell survival through
activation of antiapoptotic pathways,38 these data suggest that
activation of MerTK in KCs is of importance in differentiation
and restoration following acute liver injury. Further studies are
warranted to identify the precise mechanisms through which
MerTK regulates this process in both human and experimental
models of disease.
Our findings in APAP-treated Mer-deficient mice echo recent
data showing that MerTK promotes resolution responses by
dampening innate responses and augmenting clearance of neu￾trophils following acute tissue injury.30 39 40 In the absence of
MerTK, we report a significant depletion in hepatoprotective
resident macrophages12 13 (MHCclass IIhighLy6Clow) with the
highest phagocytic capabilities,28 a reciprocal increase in hepatic
neutrophils and persistent necrosis following APAP administra￾tion. Taken together, these data indicate that the MerTK￾bearing cells identify a hepatic macrophage population with
enhanced phagocytic capabilities that evolve following acute
hepatocellular necrosis serving to drive hepatic resolution
responses.
In both experimental and human models of ALF, we identify
SLPI as a microenvironmental mediator that critically regulates
the interplay between myeloid cells to promote hepatic reso￾lution responses through the induction of a MerTKhigh pheno￾type. Specifically, we show that SLPI selectively induces MerTK
expression in the resident KCs while concomitantly increasing
the number of apoptotic neutrophils. However, there are no
data on how SLPI modulates neutrophil function. Here, we
demonstrate that SLPI induces neutrophil apoptosis in a para￾crine manner and augments their subsequent clearance through
MerTKhigh cells. The effect of SLPI on cell clearance appears to
be highly selective in view of the fact that it does not alter clear￾ance of APAP-treated apoptotic or necrotic parenchymal cells.
Furthermore, we determined that SLPI can also drive proresolu￾tion responses through attenuation of NET formation, a process
that has been shown to exacerbate acute tissue damage through
activation of the inflammasome in ischaemia–reperfusion
injury.41 Further studies are required to examine the role of
NETosis in modulating myeloid cell activation and its effects on
acute liver injury.
Although anti-inflammatory programmes initiated following
apoptotic cell uptake are beneficial in resolving tissue injury,
they have the undesirable potential to dampen antimicrobial
responses.25 Our data support this notion as we demonstrate
that acute liver injury reprogrammes myeloid cells towards
MerTK-dependent resolution responses, which quell tissue
inflammation and promote the clearance of debris, while at
the same time suppress antimicrobial responses. Indeed, com￾parisons of MerTK transcriptional and functional profiles
between ALF and healthy controls reveal striking differences.
Here, MerTK+ monocytes in ALF have significant reductions
in immune pathways associated with innate immune recogni￾tion, signalling, antigen presentation with a concomitant upre￾gulation of M2-like and downstream MerTK signalling
pathways. Taken together, we propose that circulating mono￾cytes are specifically reprogrammed during ALF following acti￾vation of MerTK-dependent resolution responses.4 24 42
Further research is required to delineate the precise mechan￾isms of monocyte reprogramming in response to overwhelming
tissue injury.
The functional ‘reorientation’ of myeloid cells is likely to be
of pathogenic relevance in ALF, a condition that is charac￾terised by systemic immune dysregulation, immuneparesis and
a marked susceptibility to secondary infections.4 11 Here, we
also detect expanded numbers of MerTK+HLA-DR− cells, an
immune cell subset with impaired innate responses to micro￾bial challenge, during the evolution of human ALF. Given
their enhanced lymph node and tissue homing receptor expres￾sion, it is tempting to speculate that these cells are generated
following reprogramming within the inflamed liver and subse￾quently home to extrahepatic and circulatory compartments
where they serve to suppress antimicrobial responses.43 Further
work is required to delineate the recruitment and subsequent
fate of MerTK-expressing myeloid cells during acute liver
injury.
This work identified the induction of a prorestorative
MerTK-positive cell subset in ALF that may promote
tissue-repair responses, with implications for therapeutic inter￾vention, where enhancing the local function of these cells could
promote liver repair/regeneration. In this study, we used the pro￾resolving actions of SLPI as proof-of-principle in order to high￾light the biological significance of the MerTK+ phenotype in
promoting resolution responses following acute liver injury.
Using targeted strategies to harness the prorestorative capabil￾ities of MerTK+ cells represents a promising therapeutic avenue
in promoting tissue repair potentially in a number of acute
hepatic inflammatory disorders. However, caution would need
to be exercised when considering any of these therapeutic
approaches, given the evidence of peripheral monocyte suppres￾sion in ALF,11 42 indicating that the timing of therapy would
need to be carefully calibrated in order to promote resolution

while minimising the impact on immuneparesis. The balance of
these biological processes must be rationalised when considering
interventional strategies that promote liver repair processes
while not exacerbating the risk of infection.
In conclusion, our data describe a marked expansion of a pro￾restorative MerTK+ phenotype in circulating monocytes and
tissue-resident macrophages in ALF. These immunoregulatory
cells evolve in response to acute liver injury and represent a
novel immunotherapeutic target in acute hepatic injury to quell
tissue-destructive responses and promote resolution.
Furthermore, we show that SLPI acts as a key mediator in regu￾lating the function of hepatic myeloid cells, to promote reso￾lution responses through induction of MerTK expression within
the resident macrophage population.
