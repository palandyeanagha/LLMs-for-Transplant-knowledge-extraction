ABSTRACT
Objectives To test the hypothesis that vascular
abnormalities on high-resolution CT (HRCT) would be
associated with echocardiographic changes and lung
function abnormalities in patients with sickle cell disease
(SCD) and the decline in lung function seen in SCD
patients.
Methods HRCT, echocardiography and lung function
assessments were made in 35 adults, 20 of whom had
previously been assessed a median of 6.6 years prior to
this study. The pulmonary arterial dimensions on HRCT
were quantified as the mean segmental pulmonary
artery/bronchus (A/B) ratio and the summated cross￾sectional area of all pulmonary vessels <5 mm in
diameter (cross-sectional area (CSA)<5 mm%).
Results The segmental A/B ratio was negatively
correlated with FEV1, vital capacity (VC), forced
expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of VC (FEF25/75)
and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and positively with
the residual volume: total lung capacity ratio (RV:TLC)
and respiratory system resistance (Rrs). CSA<5 mm%
was negatively correlated with FEV1, FEF25/75 and SpO2
and positively with RV, RV:TLC and respiratory system
resistance (Rrs). There were significant correlations
between cardiac output assessed by echocardiography
and the segmental A/B ratio and CSA<5 mm%. Lung
function (FEV1 p=0.0004, VC p=0.0347, FEF25/75
p=0.0033) and the segmental A/B ratio (p=0.0347) and
CSA<5 mm% (p<0.0001) significantly deteriorated over
the follow-up period.
Conclusions Abnormalities in pulmonary vascular
volumes may explain some of the lung function
abnormalities and the decline in lung function seen in
adults with SCD.
INTRODUCTION
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest
inherited disorders worldwide, affecting an esti￾mated 300 000 newborns every year.1 With
improved general healthcare, the majority of
patients with SCD in developed countries can
expect to survive to adulthood. In adulthood,
however, SCD can be associated with multiorgan
damage, including pulmonary complications. Acute
chest syndrome is the commonest cause of death in
young adults, and pulmonary dysfunction is a
major contributor to morbidity in aging adults with
SCD. Lung function abnormalities are common in
adults with SCD.2–7 Adults with SCD can suffer
from parenchymal lung disease and pulmonary vas￾cular disease or both; affected individuals can
suffer premature death. Echocardiographic
abnormalities consistent with raised pulmonary
artery systolic pressure (PAP) suggestive of pulmon￾ary hypertension occur in approximately 30% of
adult SCD patients 8–10 and are associated with
increased morbidity and mortality.8 9 11 Right heart
catheterisation studies, however, have demonstrated
that only a proportion of SCD patients have pul￾monary arterial hypertension (PH), that is, elevated
pulmonary arterial vascular resistance, and it is the
presence of PH that is associated with early
death.12 Nevertheless, elevated tricuspid valve
regurgitant velocities demonstrated by echocardiog￾raphy and thought to be suggestive of raised PAP
are independently predictive of mortality.8 13
We have previously demonstrated that the major￾ity of a cohort of adult patients with SCD had pul￾monary abnormalities on high-resolution CT
(HRCT).7 The HRCT findings significantly corre￾lated with pulmonary function testing results; in
particular, there were correlations between reduc￾tions in FVC and FEV1 and the prominence of the
central vessels on HRCT. Prominent central vessels
were found on HRCT in eight of the nine patients
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Vascular abnormalities on high-resolution CT
(HRCT) would be associated with
echocardiographic changes and lung function
abnormalities in patients with sickle cell
disease (SCD) and with the decline in lung
function seen in SCD patients.
What is the bottom line?
▸ We have demonstrated an association between
small vessel pulmonary vascular dimensions on
HRCT reflecting pulmonary vascular volume,
lung function abnormalities and
echocardiographic estimates of ventricular
function and cardiac output in adults with SCD;
in addition, the decline in lung function
correlated with changes in vascular dimension.
Why read on?
▸ Alterations in pulmonary vascular volumes due
to anaemia in SCD patients may be responsible
for some of their lung function abnormalities
and changes seen on HRCT and their decline in
lung function.

with restrictive abnormalities. The prominent central vessels
may reflect the raised pulmonary capillary blood volume as a
result of chronic anaemia causing an increased cardiac output
(CO)14 and dilation of the pulmonary vessels.15 We have
demonstrated in SCD children that the increased pulmonary
capillary blood volume contributes to their increased airways
obstruction.16 Hence, we hypothesised that the central vessel
prominence would be associated with echocardiographic
changes and lung function abnormalities. The aim of this study
was to test that hypothesis by prospectively undertaking HRCT
studies, lung function and echocardiographic assessments. A
further aim of this study was to reassess the cohort examined
7 years ago7 to determine whether any decline in lung function
correlated with vascular changes evidenced by HRCT studies.
METHODS
Adults with SCD were assessed between 2009 and 2013.
Subjects included in the previous study7 had initially been
assessed between 2003 and 2005. All participants gave written
informed consent.
Lung function assessments
FEV1, vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory flow between 25
and 75% of VC (FEF25/27), total lung capacity (TLC), residual
volume (RV) and mean respiratory system resistance (Rrs) were
measured.
CT
CT patterns were quantified independently by two thoracic radiol￾ogists blinded to the clinical and functional data. The extent and
severity of CTabnormalities were recorded in individual lobes, the
lingula being considered a separate lobe for scoring purposes.
Distal vessel dimensions, including both arteries and veins at the
sub-subsegmental level,17 were measured using the method of
Matsuoka et al.
18 19 The total summated cross-sectional area for
the vessels was then expressed as a percentage of the total lung
area of the three selected slices using threshold values between
−500 and −1024 HU (cross-sectional area (CSA)<5 mm%)
(figure 1). The mean segmental artery/bronchus (A/B) ratio in at
least three of four lobes was calculated. CT total lung volume
(TLVCT) was derived using a proprietary lung segmentation algo￾rithm (figure 2). For the longitudinal analyses, initial and
follow-up CT scans were compared.
Echocardiography
Two-dimensional and three-dimensional transthoracic echocardi￾ography was performed according to the international guide￾lines.20 Examinations were performed using digital acquisitions
on a Phillips Sonos 7500 ultrasound system. Valvular
regurgitation was graded from Doppler determinations of trans￾valvar flow. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was assessed in the
parasternal right ventricular inflow, parasternal short axis and
apical four-chamber views. A minimum of five sequential com￾plexes were recorded. Continuous-wave Doppler signals of the
peak regurgitant jet velocities (TRV) (normal <2.5 m/s) were
used to estimate the right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP)
using the Bernoulli equation (ie, 4 × [tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity]2
). PAP (normal <25 mm Hg) was calculated as the sum
of RVSP and right atrial systolic pressures. CO (normal range
4.0–8.0 L/s) and right-ventricular diastolic volumes (RVDV)
(normal range 100–160 mL) were also measured. Right and left
ventricular function were assessed by measurement of the tricus￾pid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (normal >1.5 cm)
and the ratio of early diastolic LV inflow (E) to lateral mitral
annulus velocity (e0
) measured by tissue Doppler (E/e0
) (normal
<8). Technically acceptable TAPSE measurements were available
in 32 patients and E/e0 in 33 patients.

initial assessment 38, range 17–66 years) had been assessed at a
median of 6.6 (range 5.5–6.7) years previously.
Lung function test results
There was a wide variation in the lung function of the cohort
(table 1). In total, 28 of the 35 patients (80%) had lung function
abnormalities: 8 (23%) had a restrictive abnormality, 6 (17%)
an obstructive abnormality, 4 (11%) a mixed abnormality and
10 (29%) an isolated reduction in carbon monoxide diffusing
capacity (DLCO). Six patients (17%) had a significant response
to bronchodilator; three had an obstructive, one a mixed and
one a restrictive abnormality, and one no lung function abnor￾mality. Sixteen patients (46%) had elevated Rrs; six of whom
otherwise had normal lung function.
HRCT abnormalities
A reticular pattern on HRCT was the most prevalent and exten￾sive abnormality, seen in 26 patients (median 5 (range 0–17.5)
%). Ground glass opacification was present in nine patients
(median extent 0 (range 0–3)). Consolidation was seen in nine
patients (median extent 0.4 (0–4.2)). Reduction in lobar volume
was seen in 19 patients (median severity 1 (range 0–7)). Linear
bands were seen in 23 patients (median 1 (range 0–6)) and sub￾pleural curvilinear lines in 9 patients (median 0 (range 0–3)).
Subpleural consolidation (n=6), thickened interlobular septa
(n=2), infarcts (n=7) and traction bronchiectasis (n=0) were
present in a minority of patients and excluded from further ana￾lysis. The median pulmonary artery to ascending aorta ratio
(PA/AA) was 0.90 (range 0.8–1.30), the A/B ratio 1.30 (range
1.0–2.50) and CSA<5 mm% 0.48 (range 0.22–10.2). The
extent of a reticular pattern was positively correlated with the
presence of linear bands (r=0.64, p<0.0001) and ground glass
opacification score (r=0.42, p=0.0115). The presence of linear
bands was positively correlated with subpleural curvilinear lines
(r=0.39, p=0.0204), which were positively related to the A/B
ratio (r=046, p=0.0056). The A/B ratio and CSA<5 mm%
were positively correlated (r=0.72, p<0.0001).
Relationships between pulmonary function and HRCT results
Subpleural curvilinear lines were negatively correlated with
FEV1 (r=−0.39, p=0.0230) and FEF25/75 (r=−0.44,
p=0.0403), and the extent of a reticular pattern was negatively
correlated with Rrs(0) (r=−0.40, p=0.0198). TLVCT was posi￾tively correlated with FEV1 (r=0.57, p=0.0014), VC (r=0.66,
p < 0.0001) and TLC (r=0.82, p<0.0001). The segmental A/B
ratio was negatively correlated with FEV1 (r=−0.53,
p=0.0011), VC (r=−0.48, p=0.0036), FEF25/75 (r=−0.44,
p=0.0403) and SpO2 (r=−0.47, 0.0037), and positively with
RV:TLC (r=0.45, p=0.0073), and Rrs(1) (r=0.22, p=0.0267).
The CSA<5 mm% was negatively correlated with FEV1 (r=
−0.71, p<0.0001), VC (r=−0.72, p<0.0001), FEF25/75 (r=
−0.51, p=0.0010) and SpO2 (r=−0.44, p=0.0070), and posi￾tively to RV (r=0.51, p=0.0020), RV:TLC (r=0.695,
p<0.0001), Rrs(0) (r=0.35, p=0.0417) and Rrs(1) (r=0.67,
p<0.0001).
The segmental A/B ratio and CSA<5 mm% exhibited a
strong degree of multicollinearity. Therefore, separate models
were generated with segmental A/B ratio or CSA<5 mm% as
predictors. On stepwise regression, the segmental A/B ratio was
independently related to a reduced FEV1, VC, FEF25/75 and
SpO2 and to an increased RV, RV:TLC, Rrs(0) and Rrs(1)
(table 2). Linear bands were independently linked to a reduced
FVC and TLC (table 2).The CSA<5 mm% was independently
linked to a reduced FEV1, VC, FEF25/75 and SpO2 and to an
increased RV, RV:TLC, Rrs(0) and Rrs(1) (table 3). The extent
of a reticular pattern was associated with a reduced Rrs(0) and
Rrs(1) (table 3).

Echocardiography results
The median TRV was 2.65 (range 1.19–3.60) (m/s), the median
estimated PAP 33.5 (range 9.0–70.0) (mm Hg), the median CO
6.0 (range 3.3–9.1) (L/min) and the median RVDV 93.9 (range
36.7–182.6) (mL). The median TAPSE was 2.30 (1.00–3.95)
(cm), and the median E/e0 ratio was 7.60 (4.70–16.60).
Significant correlations were observed between CO and the A/B
ratio (r=0.41, p=0.0120) and the CSA<5 mm% (r=0.35,
p=0.0440), but not with the estimated PAP. There was a correl￾ation of CSA<5 mm% with E/e0 (r=0.45, p=0.009). There was
also a correlation of CSA<5 mm% with TAPSE (r=−0.38,
p=0.035), but only one subject had an abnormal TAPSE result
(<1.5) and thus we cannot comment on the relationship
between HRCT indices of vascular dilatation and echo indices
of RV dysfunction.
The segmental A/B ratio and the CSA<5 mm% were signifi￾cantly correlated with the haemoglobin level (r=−0.50,
p=0.0021; r=−0.42, p=0.0090, respectively) and the
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (r=0.33, p=0.0450; r=0.33,
p=0.0492, respectively). The segmental A/B ratio was related to
the bilirubin level (r=0.47, p=0.0037) and the CSA<5 mm%
to the reticulocyte count (r=0.39, p=0.0167).
Longitudinal analysis
The lung function results of the 20 patients who were reassessed
had declined significantly (table 4). There were, however, no sig￾nificant changes seen in the prevalence or extent/severity of lung
parenchymal abnormalities on CT, but both the median segmen￾tal A/B ratio and CSA<5 mm% had increased significantly over
the follow-up period (table 5). The percentage change from
baseline in the A/B ratio correlated negatively with that in FEV1
(r=0.330, p=0.0156) and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient,
corrected for haemoglobin concentration (KCO) (r=−0.554,
p=0.0139) and positively with that in RV (r=0.475, p=0.0342)
and RV:TLC (r=−0.557, p=0.0107). The percentage change
from baseline in CSA<5 mm% correlated negatively with that
in FEV1 (r=−0.330, p=0.0079) and VC (r=−0.487,
p=0.0357) and positively with RV:TLC (r=0.557, p=0.0164).
Logistic regression demonstrated that a higher CSA<5 mm% at
baseline was predictive of a subsequent overall deterioration in
HRCT appearance, that is, a gestalt change score of 1 (OR 2.62
(95% CI 1.14 to 6.01) per unit increase in CSA<5 mm%,
p=0.023). Linear mixed model analysis demonstrated a signifi￾cant association of baseline CSA<5 mm% with subsequent
decline in TLC, with an increased decline of −1.84% (95% CI
−3.31 to −0.37) per year for each unit increase in CSA<5 mm
% at baseline, p=0.014. CSA<5 mm% was also predictive of a
more rapid change in RV:TLC, with a change in slope of
+4.93% (95% CI 0.88 to 8.99) per year per unit increase in
CSA<5 mm% at baseline, p=0.017.
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that pulmonary vascular abnormalities
on HRCT were significantly related to pulmonary function
impairment in adults with SCD. The segmental A/B ratio and
CSA<5 mm% were independently linked to reductions in
FEV1, VC and FEF25/75 and to increased respiratory system
resistance and RV:TLC. In addition, small vessel size correlated
with reduced oxygen saturation and haemoglobin concentration
and increased LDH, bilirubin and reticulocyte levels. Those
results suggest relationships between anaemia, haemolysis,
hypoxia and pulmonary function abnormalities. We found a
positive correlation between CSA<5 mm% (a measure of distal
arteries and veins) and E/e0 which is a marker of left atrial filling
pressure that is elevated if there is LV diastolic dysfunction. A
higher E/e0 would result in some elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure, and this result suggests a role for precapillary and post￾capillary pulmonary vascular changes in SCD-related lung

disease. There was a negative relationship with vascular dimen￾sions and VC, FEV1, FEF25/75 and SpO2 and a positive relation￾ship with RV, RV:TLC, Rrs(0) and Rrs(1), suggesting vascular
dimensions were related to an obstructive defect. VC, FEV and
FEF25/75, however, can be reduced in both obstruction and
restriction and thus the correlations with markers of vascular
dilation and reductions in VC, FEV1 and FEF25/75 may also
indicate a relationship between vascular dilation and the devel￾opment of restrictive lung function.
In our cohort, 23% of patients had evidence of a restrictive
lung function defect and 17% had evidence of an obstructive
defect. Those results are consistent with those of Santoli et al5
but differ from those of Klings et al,
3 who found a much lower
incidence of airflow obstruction. The differences may be due to
a number of factors. We used a recently reported ethnic-specific
reference range for spirometry,21 whereas Klings et al3 used a
Caucasian reference range with fixed correction factors to adjust
for ethnicity. We classified abnormalities based on the lower
limit of normal based on percentiles recommended by the
American and European Thoracic Societies,22 whereas Klings
et al used a fixed percentage predicted value to define the lower
limit of normal for all lung function indices, which does not
take into account that the limits of the normal range vary with
age, sex and ethnicity. Furthermore, the classification scheme in
the Kling’s study specified that in order to be classified as
obstructive or mixed, the DLCO had to be normal, which pre￾cluded the possibility that impaired gas transfer coexisted with
airway abnormalities.
Restrictive lung function defects, that is, a reduced TLC and
RV, were not associated with the extent of ground glass opacifica￾tion or a reticular pattern and showed only a modest association
with linear bands, suggesting interstitial fibrosis may not be the
predominant mechanism for loss of lung volume in patients with
SCD. Indeed, most CT markers of pulmonary fibrosis showed no
association with reductions in VC, FEV1, FEF25/75, RV:TLC
SpO2, Rrs(0) or Rrs(1). The extent of a reticular pattern was
associated with a reduction in respiratory system resistance; we
speculate that this might be due to the tractional effects of areas
of fibrosis on adjacent bronchi. Subpleural curvilinear bands were
noted in 26% of patients; this is an unusual CT sign, formerly
believed to be pathognomonic of early asbestosis.23 Subpleural
curvilinear bands have subsequently been described in association
with micro-atelectasis in patients with atrial septal defect24 or
respiratory muscle weakness25 and as reversible sign caused by
interstitial oedema resulting from pulmonary congestion.26
Observations in subjects without lung disease and undergoing
lymphography have led to the suggestion that the sign may repre￾sent an engorged subpleural lymphatic network.27 Given the
presence of a high-output state in SCD, and the correlation of
subpleural curvilinear lines with markers of small-vessel dilata￾tion observed in our cohort, it is tempting to speculate that this
pattern may be related to interstitial oedema and/or increased
lymphatic drainage.
We highlight a decline in lung function over a mean of
6.6 years in adults with SCD. A significant decrease was
observed in VC, FEV1, FEF25/75, FEV1:VC and KCOc with a
significant increase in RV:TLC. There were no significant
changes in the results of the CT assessments other than in vascu￾lar dimension assessments, where both the A/B ratio and
CSA<5 mm% significantly increased. Those results suggest
changes in pulmonary vascular dimensions may be responsible
for the decline in lung function. Furthermore, a greater baseline
CSA<5 mm% was predictive of a more rapid progression of
both obstructive (increasing RV:TLC) and restrictive (decreasing
TLC) lung disease and an increased likelihood of a deterioration
in parenchymal disease, as evidenced on HRCT examination.
Our results emphasise the phenotypic heterogeneity of SCD
lung disease. The changes in vascular morphology related to
obstructive defects and the likelihood of deteriorating interstitial
lung disease, suggesting that there may be a shared mechanism
involving small pulmonary vessels. Field et al28 demonstrated
that bone marrow-derived fibrocytes may be mobilised into the
circulation and subsequently extravasate into the lungs of SCD
mice. There they function as mesenchymal progenitor cells for
the production of extracellular matrix and contribute to the
development of fibrosis. Elevated levels of circulating fibroctyes
have been observed in humans with SCD.28 We, therefore,
speculate that pulmonary vascular engorgement and distension
may potentiate extravasation of circulating fibrocytes.
This study has strengths, but some limitations too. A strength
of this study was the use of two different quantitative methods
for assessing pulmonary vascular morphology, the segmental
A/B ratio and CSA<5 mm%, which yielded similar results. We
used ethnic-specific references for spirometric indices, but the
static lung volume results were related to reference ranges
derived from Caucasian subjects with a fixed correction factor
to account for ethnicity. All the study population were African
or Caribbean, thus correlations within the cohort and compari￾sons between results at baseline and follow-up were valid. A
limitation is that we did not have right heart catheterisation data
for pulmonary artery pressures and resistance, but all the
patients underwent the same echocardiographic protocol.
Studies have demonstrated a minority of patients with elevated
TRV have elevated pulmonary artery pressure. In a recent study,
only 8 of 26 patients with elevated TRV at echocardiography
had elevated pulmonary artery pressure confirmed by right
heart catherisation29 and similar findings were reported in a
larger study with 10.4% of 243 patients with elevated TRV
having pulmonary hypertension.30 It should be noted, however,
that a TRV of >2.5 m/s (corresponding to an estimated mPAP
greater than or equal to approximately 2 SDs above normal)
does not meet the criteria for right-heart catheter-defined pul￾monary arterial hypertension (mPAP >25 mm Hg), which is 3
SDs above normal. The latter corresponds to a TRV of approxi￾mately 3.0 m/s, which occurs in only about one-third of
patients. Different HRCT protocols were used in our earlier
study,7 and in this study, however, care was taken to ensure that
all the images used for comparisons were from anatomically
comparable sections. In addition, scoring was undertaken by
observers who were blinded to the results of lung function and
echocardiography results. The consistent relationship between
CSA<5 mm%, A/B ratio and lung function test results suggests
the different protocols did not adversely influence our results.
We have shown that, if TLVCT is measured, volumetric HRCT
scans are able to capture both restrictive and obstructive func￾tional abnormalities, providing an alternative method to assess
global pulmonary impairment in patients with SCD.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an association between
small-vessel pulmonary vascular dimensions on HRCT reflecting
pulmonary vascular volume, lung function abnormalities and
echocardiographic estimates of CO and ventricular function in
adults with SCD. Our results suggest that abnormalities in pul￾monary vascular volumes may explain some of the lung function
abnormalities and the decline in lung function seen in adults
with SCD.
