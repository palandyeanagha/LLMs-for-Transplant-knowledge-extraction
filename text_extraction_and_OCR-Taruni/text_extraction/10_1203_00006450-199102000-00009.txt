phenylacetate, 12 g (64.5 mmol) of sodium phenylbutyrate, and 
14 g (75.2 mmol) of sodium phenylbutyrate. His daily diet during 
the three periods consisted of 1 1 g of natural protein, 1 1 g of an 
essential amino acid mixture (nitrogen density 12%), and 4.5 g 
(25.7 mmol) of citrulline. The total nitrogen intake was calcu￾lated to be 3.84 g, which included 0.4 g of nitrogen in the gelatin 
capsules containing the drugs and the one third of administered 
citrulline nitrogen that enters the free amino acid pool. Total 
urinary nitrogen, urea nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen were 
measured in each period. 
In the second study, the overnight fasting plasma levels of 
phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, and PAG were measured in pa￾tients with various urea cycle disorders receiving varying dosages 
of sodium phenylbutyrate. 
In the third study, the diurnal variation in plasma levels of 
glutamine, phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, PAG, and ammo￾nium was studied in five patients with deficiencies of carbamyl 
phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, four of 
whom were treated with phenylaceate or phenylbutyrate. 
Plasma levels of phenylacetate and PAG were measured by 
reverse phase HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) after precipitation 
with methanol. The technique includes isocratic elution using 
the mobile phase of 0.005 M phosphoric acid in 10% methanol 
at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min with spectrophotometric detection 
at 2 18 nm. Urine levels were similarly measured after appropriate 
dilution. The detection limits in plasma and urine for phenyl￾butyrate, phenylacetate, and PAG were 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02 
mmol/L, respectively. 
Phenylbutyrate levels in plasma were also similarly measured 
except for the mobile phase, which consisted of 0.005 mol/L 
phosphoric acid in 40% methanol. PAG (for use as an external 
standard) was synthesized from phenylacetyl chloride and glu￾tamine (10). Plasma amino acids were measured by automated 
column chromatography (model 6300; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). 
Urinary creatinine was measured by the Jaffe reaction after 
absorption and elution from Lloyds reagent (1 I). Plasma am￾monium was measured by visible spectrophotometry using the 
indophenol reaction after separation of the ammonium ion by a 
batch cation exchange technique (1 2). Urine glucuronides were 
measured using the naptharesorcinol reagent (1 3). Urinary nitro￾gen was measured by the Kjeldahl method previously described 
(14) and urinary urea and ammonium were measured as de￾scribed by Chaney and Marbach (1 5). 
These studies were approved by The Johns Hopkins Joint 
Committee on Clinical Investigation. 
RESULTS 
Table 1 compares the stoichiometry between phenylacetate or 
phenylbutyrate administration and urinary excretion of PAG. 
The amount of PAG excreted was a function of phenylacetate 
or phenylbutyrate dose; between 80 and 90% of the predicted 
amount of PAG synthesized is excreted. That these may be 
minimum excretion values is suggested by the coeficient of 
variation of the creatinine excretion over the 9 d, which was 
14%. Table 1 also demonstrates that when PAG excretion is 
expressed as PAG nitrogen, it accounts for at least 38-44% of 
dietary nitrogen intake. Phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, or total 
glucuronide excretion in the urine did not exceed 1% of the 
administered drug in any period.

appears to be completely oxidized to phenylacetate and that 
phenylacetate is completely, or nearly so, conjugated with glu￾tamine. 
That complete conjugation of the drugs occurs may be further 
adduced by the insignificant amount of unchanged drugs or their 
esters in urine and by the lack of accumulation in overnight 
fasting plasma (Table 2). 
Table 1 also shows the relationship between PAG nitrogen 
excretion and dietary nitrogen. At doses of sodium phenylbutyr￾ate of 0.44 1 and 0.5 15 g/kg/d, 1.62 and 2.88 g/d of PAG nitrogen 
were excreted representing at least 42 and 44% of dietary nitro￾gen. When compared to the relationship between urea nitrogen

nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen in each of the 3-d periods, 
during which he received between 1 1 and 12 g of dietary nitrogen 
and 13.5 g (77.1 mmol) of citrulline. 
To evaluate whether phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, or PAG 
accumulate, overnight fasting plasma levels were measured in 10 
patients receiving oral sodium phenylbutyrate at doses varying 
from 0.306 to 0.65 g/kg/d (Table 3). With only two exceptions, 
overnight fasting plasma levels of phenylbutyrate and phenylac￾etate were below the limits of detectability. Plasma levels of PAG 
were below 0.5 mmol/L. 
Figure 1 shows the diurnal variation of plasma glutamine level 
in two untreated females with ornithine transcarbamylase defi￾ciency and four treated patients with a deficiency of either 
carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase. 
Plasma glutamine levels returned to normal during the day in 
each treated patient regardless of the overnight fasting glutamine 
levels, which were 0.67, 1.3 1, 1.26, and 1.20 mmol/L (normal, 
0.596 + 0.66 mmol/L). The plasma glutamine level remained 
unchanged at high levels (>I mmol/L) in the two untreated 
patients. 
In patients receiving sodium phenylbutyrate, the mean (a1 
SD) diurnal plasma levels of phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, and 
PAG (excluding overnight fasting values described earlier) were 
0.37 + 0.3, 0.17 + 0.25, and 1.42 + 0.9 1 mmol/L, respectively. 
For the patient who received only sodium phenylacetate, the 
mean (+SD) diurnal plasma levels of phenylacetate and PAG 
were (excluding overnight fasting levels) 0.88 + 0.49 and 0.79 a 
0.48 mmol/L, respectively. Excluding overnight fasting values, 
the range of plasma levels of phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, and 
PAG were 0.026-1.87, 0-0.872, and 0.093-3.15 mmol/L, re￾spectively. Throughout the day, the mean plasma ammonium 
level for the four treated patients was 25.5 a 3.3 pmol/L, range 
20-34 (upper limit of normal, <30). 
- 
That this patient synthesized little or no urea may be inferred 
by comparing urinary urea excretion (Table 2) with citrulline 
intake. Urinary urea nitrogen excretion in each 3-d period varied 
from 0.94 g (33 mmol urea) to 1.75 g (62.5 mmol urea), all of 
which can be accounted for by the normal metabolic fate of the 
supplementary dietary citrulline in each period (77.1 mmol). 
It has been apparent for a number of years that hyperammo￾nemia in patients with inborn errors of urea synthesis is always 
associated with high plasma glutamine levels (1, 16). It also has 
been shown in such patients that plasma glutamine levels increase 
before the onset of symptomatic hyperammonemia (17). Figure 
1 suggests that phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate are effective in 
maintaining normal nitrogen homeostasis as manifested by 
maintenance of plasma glutamine levels at normal or near nor￾mal levels during the day without significant accumulation of 
drugs or their reaction products. 
Our data support the hypothesis that high doses of phenylac￾etate or phenylbutyrate will result in the synthesis and excretion 
of PAG nitrogen similar to the amount of urea nitrogen that is 
excreted in normal subjects on a low-protein diet. Unlike urea 
synthesis, which will increase or decrease in proportion to nitro￾gen intake, PAG nitrogen synthesis is a function of the dose of 
phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate. Therefore, the appropriate dose 
will be a function of dietary nitrogen and nitrogen retention. 
Under circumstances of avid nitrogen retention (e.g. premature 
or full-term infants and patients on marginal nitrogen intakes) it 
may be possible to induce riegative nitrogen balance by admin￾istering high-dose phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate. For example, 
a nutritionally stable 6-y-old boy with ornithine transcarbamyl￾ase deficiency receiving an essential amino acid diet developed 
alopecia, periorbital edema, and hypoproteinemia shortly after 
phenylbutyrate was substituted for benzoate (unpublished obser￾vations). His nutritional deficiencies promptly resolved when 
protein was added to his diet. 
Whether phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate may be helpful in 
the management of other nitrogen accumulation diseases, such 
as hepatic encephalopathy or chronic renal disease, remains to 
be tested. Although both the liver and the kidney have the 
requisite enzyme activity for glutamine conjugation (1 8, 19), 
phenylacetyl CoA ligase and acyl-CoA:L-glutamine N-acyl-trans￾ferase, it is not certain that either organ alone will have the 
requisite activity or, in the case of chronic renal disease, whether 
PAG accumulation may limit the usefulness of these drugs.
