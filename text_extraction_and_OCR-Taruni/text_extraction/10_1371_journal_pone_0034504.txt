Abstract
Background: Oxidative stress is known to play an important role in the pathology of traumatic brain injury. Mitochondria
are thought to be the major source of the damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) following TBI. However, recent work has
revealed that the membrane, via the enzyme NADPH oxidase can also generate the superoxide radical (O2
2), and thereby
potentially contribute to the oxidative stress following TBI. The current study thus addressed the potential role of NADPH
oxidase in TBI.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The results revealed that NADPH oxidase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal
CA1 region increases rapidly following controlled cortical impact in male mice, with an early peak at 1 h, followed by a
secondary peak from 24–96 h after TBI. In situ localization using oxidized hydroethidine and the neuronal marker, NeuN,
revealed that the O2
2 induction occurred in neurons at 1 h after TBI. Pre- or post-treatment with the NADPH oxidase
inhibitor, apocynin markedly inhibited microglial activation and oxidative stress damage. Apocynin also attenuated TBI￾induction of the Alzheimer’s disease proteins b-amyloid and amyloid precursor protein. Finally, both pre- and post￾treatment of apocynin was also shown to induce significant neuroprotection against TBI. In addition, a NOX2-specific
inhibitor, gp91ds-tat was also shown to exert neuroprotection against TBI.
Conclusions/Significance: As a whole, the study demonstrates that NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide production
exhibit a biphasic elevation in the hippocampus and cortex following TBI, which contributes significantly to the pathology
of TBI via mediation of oxidative stress damage, microglial activation, and AD protein induction in the brain following TBI.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and
disability in young people in the United States. Approximately 1.5
million people are affected each year with TBI, and despite
advances in research and care, severe TBI still exhibits a mortality
index as high as 35%–40%. Thus, the clinical outcome of severely
head-injured patients is still poor. Primary damage in TBI is
thought to result from mechanical forces applied to the skull and
brain at the time of impact, leading to focal or diffuse brain injury
patterns [1]. Secondary brain injuries, on the other hand, evolve
over time [2]. These are characterized by a complex cascade of
biochemical events that lead to neuroinflammation, brain edema,
and delayed neuronal cell death [3–7].
Oxidative stress has been implicated to play a significant role in
the pathology of TBI [8–10]. The most commonly occurring
cellular free radical is superoxide radical (O2
2), which is produced
when an oxygen molecule gains one electron from another
substance. Excess O2
2 leads to tissue damage by promoting
hydroxyl radical (OH2) formation through hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), and by combining with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite
(ONO2
2), a powerful oxidant formed from superoxide and NO
that can damage a wide array of molecules in cells [11]. It has
been generally assumed that mitochondria are the major source of
O2
2 following brain injury [12]. However, recent work has shown
that the enzyme, NADPH oxidase can also contribute to O2
2
production in cells. NADPH oxidase is a membrane enzyme
composed of several subunits that include NOX and phox subunits
[13,14]. There are several isoforms of NOX, termed NOX 1–5
[13]. Previous work by our laboratory and others has shown that
the NOX2 NADPH oxidase is highly localized in the cerebral
cortex and hippocampal CA1 region [15,16]. Our laboratory and
others also demonstrated that NOX2 is localized in neurons and
microglia in the cortex and hippocampus [13,15,16]. NOX2
activation is dependent upon forming an active complex with
several phox subunits (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox) and activated

Rac1, which upon cell stress or activation translocate to the
membrane from the cytoplasm to form the activated NADPH
oxidase complex [13,15]. Work from several labs including our
own has shown that over-activation of neuronal NOX2 NADPH
oxidase contributes significantly to ischemic oxidative damage to
neurons and other cell types following cerebral ischemia
[13,16,17]. NADPH oxidase is also localized in microglial and
thus has the potential to contribute to neuroinflammation, as the
extracellular ROS produced by microglia is directly toxic to
neurons, and intracellular ROS in the microglia can amplify the
production of several pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic cytokines
[18].
Currently, there is little known on the role of NADPH oxidase
in TBI. One recent report suggested that NADPH oxidase plays a
role in microglia activation in the cerebral cortex at 24 h–48 h
following TBI [19]. It is unknown whether NADPH oxidase
mediates earlier elevations in ROS that occurs within 1–3 h after
TBI, and whether it plays a significant role in oxidative stress
induction and damage that has been shown to occur as early as
3 h after TBI [9]. It is also unclear as to whether NADPH oxidase
may play a role in the induction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-
related proteins such as amyloid processing protein (APP) and b￾amyloid, which have been implicated in the pathology of TBI. The
current studies were designed to address these key deficits in our
knowledge.
Methods
Controlled Cortical Impact
Animal studies were approved by the Committee on Animal
Use for Research and Education at Georgia Health Sciences
University (protocol # BR10-05-330), in compliance with NIH
guidelines. Adult male CD-1 (Charles River, Wilmington, MA)
mice were anesthetized with xylazine (8 mg/kg)/ketamine
(60 mg/kg) and subjected to a sham injury or controlled cortical
impact, as detailed by our laboratory [20,21]. Briefly, mice were
placed in a stereotaxic frame (Amscien Instruments, Richmond,
VA, USA) and a 3.5 mm craniotomy was made in the right
parietal bone midway between bregma and lambda with the
medial edge 1 mm lateral to the midline, leaving the dura intact.
Mice were impacted at 4.5 m/s with a 20 ms dwell time and
1 mm depression using a 3 mm diameter convex tip, mimicking a
moderate TBI. Sham-operated mice underwent the identical
surgical procedures, but were not impacted. The incision was
closed with surgical staples and mice were allowed to recover.
Throughout all procedures, body temperature was maintained at
37uC using a small animal temperature controller (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). The NADPH oxidase inhibitor,
apocynin (Sigma-Aldrich, 4 mg/kg) or saline were administered
by intraperitoneal (IP) injections 20 min prior to TBI or 2 h after
TBI. In addition, in some studies, a NOX2 competitive inhibitor,
gp91ds–tat or its scrambled control peptide (Scr) (250 mg/mouse,
synthesized by AnaSpec) were administered by IP injection 20 min
prior to TBI.
Assessment of Cerebral Edema
Brain water content (BWC), a sensitive measure of cerebral
edema, was quantified using the wet-dry method, as detailed by
our group [20,22]. At 24 h post-injury, a time-point associated
with significant edema formation after experimental TBI
[20,23,24], BWC was estimated in 3 mm coronal sections of the
ipsilateral cortex (or corresponding contralateral cortex), centered
upon the impact site. Tissue was immediately weighed (wet
weight), then dehydrated at 65uC. The sample was reweighed 48 h
later to obtain a dry weight. The percentage of tissue water
content was calculated using the following formula: BWC = [(wet
weight–dried weight)/wet weight]6100%.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blotting was performed as described in detail by our
laboratory [25]. The pericontusional cerebral cortex was micro￾dissected from brain tissue and immediately frozen in dry ice.
Tissues samples were homogenized using a glass homogenizer with
ice-cold homogenization buffer. Protein concentrations were
determined by the Modified Lowry Protein Assay (Pierce,
Rockford, ILL). Samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis,
transferred to PVDF membranes, and Western blotted with an
anti-b-Amyloid (sc-28365, Santa Cruz), anti-APP (#36-6900,
Invitrogen) or anti-b-Actin (sc-81178, Santa Cruz) antibody.
Bound proteins were visualized using the Odyssey Imaging System
(LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NB) and analyzed with the Image J
analysis software (Version 1.30v; NIH, USA). Band densities were
normalized to actin and expressed as fold changes of control
animals. A Mean 6 SE were calculated from the data from all the
animals for graphical presentation and statistical comparison.
Immunohistochemistry
DAB staining was performed using the VECTASTAIN Elite
ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., CA) as described previously
by our laboratory [25]. Briefly, after blocking with normal goat/
horse serum for 1 h, sections were incubated with the primary
antibodies overnight at 4uC, followed by incubation with
secondary biotinylated antibodies and ABC reagents for 1 h,
separately. Color was developed with DAB reagent for 2–10 min.
Images were captured using an AxioVision4Ac microscope system
(Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis
Confocal analysis was performed as described previously by our
laboratory [25]. Briefly, coronal brain sections (20 mm) were cut
on a microtome after perfusion and cryoprotection. Staining was
performed using a mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (1:500,
Chemicon, MA, USA), and the anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody
(OX-42, 1:500, Abcam) following the manufacturer’s instruction.
All the confocal images were captured on an LSM510 Meta
confocal microscope and images were viewed using LSM510 Meta
and Volocity 4.0 imaging software.
Histology and Assessment of Surviving Cells
Coronal sections (25-mm thick) were collected throughout the
entire dorsal hippocampus from animals sacrificed at 4 d after
TBI, and every eighth section was collected and stained. Sections
were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Cresyl violet for 5 min, dehydrated
through graded concentrations of ethanol, and cleared in xylene.
The slides were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 (Zeiss,
Germany), and the densities of surviving neurons in the
pericontusional cerebral cortex and the medial CA1/CA3
pyramidal cell layer were counted on each section using the
unbiased Stereologer System (Stereology Resource Center,
Chester, MD, USA) [26]. The counting parameters utilized were
the distance between counting frames (75 mm), the counting frame
size (2006200 mm), the disector height (10 mm), and the guard￾zone thickness (2 mm). Intact cells showing round nuclei but not
condensed, pyknotic nuclei were counted as surviving cells. Means
6 SE were calculated from the data in each group, and statistical
analysis was performed as described below. The numbers of
surviving cells were expressed as percentage of sham control.

NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide production assay
NADPH oxidase activity was determined as described previ￾ously by our laboratory [27]. Briefly, assays were carried out in a
final volume of 1 ml containing 50 mM Krebs-Ringer Phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM
lucigenin, 0.1 mM NADPH, and 50 mg tissue homogenate.
Photoemissions, expressed in terms of relative light units (RLU),
were measured every min for 5 min using a luminometer.
Superoxide production was measured using a LumiMax Super￾oxide Anion Detection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 50 mg sample proteins were
suspended in 100 ml assay medium, and then mixed with 100 ml of
reagent mixture containing 0.2 mM luminol, 0.25 mM enhancer.
Light emissions at 30-sec intervals were recorded by a standard
luminometer. All the values were standardized to the amount of
protein and were calculated as RLU/mg protein/min. A Mean 6
SE was calculated from the data collected in each group for
graphical depiction.
In situ detection of superoxide production
The production of superoxide (O22) radicals was investigated
using hydroethidine (HEt) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, CA) as
described previously by our group and others [28,29]. HEt (1 mg/
ml in 200 ml PBS) was administered intravenously 30 min before
ischemia. Fluorescent intensity of the oxidized HEt was measured
on a confocal laser microscope using an excitation wavelength of
543 nm and the emission will be recorded at wavelengths between
560 and 590 nm.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) analysis, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls
post-hoc tests to determine group differences. Statistical signifi￾cance was accepted at the 95% confidence level (P,0.05). Data
was expressed as mean 6 standard error (SE).
Results
Temporal Induction of NADPH Oxidase Activation and
O2
2 Generation in the Brain Following TBI
In initial studies, we first examined the temporal pattern of
NADPH oxidase activation and O2
2 generation in the adult male
mouse cerebral cortex and whole hippocampus samples following
moderate TBI induced by controlled cortical contusion. As shown
in Fig. 1, there was rapid, robust elevation of NADPH oxidase
activity and O2
2 levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at
1 h after TBI. This rapid elevation of NADPH oxidase activity
and O2
2 levels was followed by a fall to lower but still elevated
levels at 3–6 h after TBI. Interestingly, a second significant
elevation of NADPH oxidase activity and O2
2 levels was also
observed from 24 h–96 h after TBI. In the majority of the
subsequent studies, we chose to use the 1 h time-point for further
analysis, as this was when peak NADPH oxidase activity and O2
2
levels were observed. We next sought to confirm in situ elevation of
O2
2 in the cortex and hippocampus by utilizing the hydroethidine
(HEt) method, in which HEt is selectively oxidized by O2
2 to yield
a fluorescent signal that is easily detectable in brain sections by
confocal microscopy. We also used immunohistochemistry for the
neuronal marker, NeuN, so as to determine if changes in O2
2
generation occurs in neurons. As shown in Fig. 2 in situ O2
2
levels, as measured by oxidized HEt fluorescent signal, increased
markedly at 1 h after TBI in the cortex (Fig. 2A) and
hippocampal CA1 region (Fig. 2B) in saline-treated animals as
compared to sham control animals. Furthermore, the HEt
fluorescent signal was strongly colocalized in cortical and
hippocampal neurons, as evidenced by colocalization with the
neuronal marker NeuN, suggesting that neurons are major sources
of O2
2 generation in the cortex and hippocampus in the initial
early period following TBI (Fig. 2A&B). It is likely that microglia
are the source of superoxide at later time-points; however, this
could not be confirmed using the HEt method as the elevation of
superoxide was much lower at 24–96 h as compared to 1 h post
TBI and the sensitivity of the HEt method was too low to allow
detection.
Role of NADPH Oxidase in O2
2 Generation and Oxidative
Damage in the Brain Following TBI
We next examined whether the increase in O2
2 generation in
cortical and hippocampal neurons following TBI was due to
activation of NADPH oxidase. This was determined by examining
the effect of pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor,
apocynin (4 mg/kg ip, 20 min prior to TBI) on O2
2 generation in
cortical and hippocampal neurons following TBI. As shown in
representative photomicrographs in Fig. 2A–B, pretreatment with
apocynin markedly attenuated generation of O2
2 in the cortical
and hippocampal neurons at 1 h after TBI as compared to the
saline-treated group, suggesting that NADPH oxidase plays a
critical role in O2
2 production in neurons following TBI. Fig. 2C–
D shows the mean values and statistical analysis of O2
2 generation
(as measured by using cerebral cortex and hippocampal protein
samples) in all animals, demonstrating that there is an approxi￾mate 3-fold and 7-fold increase in O2
2 levels in the cortex and
hippocampus, respectively, in saline-treated animals at 1 h after
TBI as compared to sham controls, and that pretreatment with the
NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin markedly attenuated the
induction of O2
2 following TBI. These findings suggest that
NADPH oxidase has a major role in the robust O2
2 generation
observed in the cortex and hippocampus in the early period
following TBI. We thus next examined whether inhibition of
NADPH oxidase via administration of apocynin leads to a
decrease in oxidative damage in the brain following TBI. To
accomplish this aim, brain sections were collected at 2 days after
TBI and immunohistochemistry was performed for several well
characterized markers of oxidative damage, including 4-HNE (4-
hydroxynonenal), 8-OHdG (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), and p￾H2AX (phospho-histone), which are markers of lipid peroxidation,
DNA damage and oxidative histone phosphorylation, respectively.
The results show robust increases in immunostaining intensity for
all three oxidative stress markers in the cortex and hippocampal
CA1 region in the saline-treated (TBI) group as compared to sham
controls (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both pre- and post-treatment with
the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin markedly attenuated the
oxidative stress damage following TBI, as indicated by a strong
attenuation of 4-HNE, 8-OHdG and p-H2AX immunostaining in
the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region as compared to saline￾treated (TBI) controls (Fig. 3). The results suggest an important
role for NADPH oxidase in oxidative stress damage to the brain
following TBI.
Role of NADPH Oxidase in Microglia Activation Following
TBI
It is well known that microglial activation occurs several days
after TBI and plays a role in inflammation and pathology of TBI.
We thus examined whether activation of NADPH oxidase has a
critical role in microglial activation following TBI by assessing the
effect of administration of apocynin upon microglia activation
following TBI. To access microglial activation, we performed
NADPH Oxidase and Brain Injury

immunohistochemistry on brain sections at 4 d after TBI for the
microglial activation marker, CD11b. We also performed
immunostaining with the neuronal marker, NeuN in order to
assess apocynin effects upon preservation of neuronal density. As
shown in Fig. 4 A&B, sham animals showed robust NeuN
immunostaining and low CD11b immunostaining in the cortex
and hippocampal CA1 region, indicating healthy neurons and
little microglial activation in the non-injured state. In contrast,
saline-treated animals examined at 4 d after TBI showed clear
reduction of immunostaining intensity for the neuronal marker
NeuN, and robust immunostaining for the microglial activation
marker, CD11b in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region, as
compared to the sham control (Fig. 4A&B). Intriguingly, both
pre- and post-treatment of apocynin markedly attenuated CD11b
immunostaining in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region at 4 d
after TBI, suggesting a role for NADPH oxidase activation in
microglial activation following TBI. In addition, apocynin￾pretreated animals showed enhanced NeuN immunostaining in
both the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 region at 4 d after
TBI, suggesting enhanced preservation of neurons following TBI.
NADPH Oxidase Activation Mediates b-Amyloid
Induction in the Brain Following TBI
It has been previously shown that TBI is associated with an
elevation of b-amyloid levels in the brain, which may explain an
increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia in TBI patients
[30,31]. We therefore examined b-amyloid induction in the brain
at various time-points following TBI and assessed the potential
role of NADPH oxidase activation in b-amyloid induction via use
of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin. As shown in
Fig. 5A(a), Western blot analysis revealed that b-amyloid protein
levels are significantly increased in the cerebral cortex at all time￾points examined (1 h, 2 d and 4 d after TBI) as compared to sham
controls. Interestingly, apocynin pretreatment significantly atten￾uated the elevation of b-amyloid protein levels in the cortex at all
time-points examined following TBI (Fig. 5A), suggesting that
NADPH oxidase activation is important for the induction of b￾amyloid. Fig. 5A(b) shows a similar pattern of change for amyloid
precursor protein (APP) when examined at the 2day time-point,
with TBI (saline) showing increased levels of APP in the cortex and
treatment with apocynin preventing the increase of APP. To
provide more information on potential cell types and organelles in
which the b-amyloid changes occur, we utilized immunohisto￾chemistry. As shown in Fig. 5B, sham animals showed very little
b-amyloid immunostaining in the cortex. In contrast, saline
treated (TBI) animals showed robust b-amyloid immunostaining in
the cortex at the 1 h time-point after TBI, with the staining
appearing to be in neuronal soma and axons, at least from
morphological appearance (e.g. immunostaining in round cells
and in long fiber like processes). At 2 d after TBI, many cells in the
cortex of saline-treated (TBI) mice that were b-amyloid-positive
had the morphological appearance of microglia. Both pre- and
post-treatment of apocynin caused a marked attenuation of b￾amyloid immunostaining intensity in the cortex (Fig. 5B) at 2 d
following TBI. We should add that b-amyloid immunostaining
was also observed in the hippocampal CA1 region, but at lower
levels than the cortex, and that apocynin similarly decreased the b￾amyloid immunostaining intensity in the hippocampal CA1 region
as it did in the cortex (data not shown).

Administration of the NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor,
Apocynin, Provides Significant Neuroprotection Against
TBI
Since apocynin inhibited ROS production, oxidative damage,
microglial activation and b-amyloid/APP induction in the brain
following TBI, we next examined whether apocynin exerts
significant neuroprotection against TBI. Apocynin (4 mg/kg ip)
was administered 20 min before TBI, and cell death in the
cerebral cortex and hippocampus was examined 4 days after TBI
using the cresyl violet staining procedure. Figure 6A presents
representative photomicrographs of the cresyl violet staining
results in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 and CA3
regions at 4 d after TBI. The cresyl violet staining results show
that while cortical and hippocampal cells in sham animals
displayed round and pale stained nuclei typical of normal healthy
cells; cresyl violet-stained cortical and hippocampal cells in saline￾treated (TBI) animals had a shrunken morphology with pyknotic
nuclei, indicating many dead or dying cells in the cortex and
hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Apocynin pre-administration
dramatically attenuated TBI-induced neuronal cell death in the
cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 4 days after TBI, as
determined by cresyl violet staining, which revealed less damaged
or dead cells and more healthier, normal cells as compared to the
saline-treated (TBI) control group. Unbiased stereological analysis
was used to determine cell density in the cortex and hippocampus
following TBI. As shown in Fig. 6B, the results revealed that
saline-treated (TBI) animals have very low cell density as
compared to sham controls in the cerebral cortex and hippocam￾pal CA1 and CA3 regions at 4 d after TBI. Additionally, apocynin
pretreatment resulted in a preserved cortical and hippocampal cell
density – e.g. up to 60–70% of the sham controls, indicating a
strong and significant neuroprotective effect of apocynin pretreat￾ment. Interestingly, apocynin post-administration at 2 h after TBI
also significantly attenuated the delayed neuronal cell death. This
suggests that NADPH oxidase activation and superoxide eleva￾Figure 6. Neuroprotective effects of apocynin in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus(CA1 and CA3 regions) following TBI. A:

tions after the peak induction at 1 h play a major role in neuronal
cell death following TBI.
Evidence that the NOX2 isoform of NADPH Oxidase Plays
a Critical Role in Neuronal Damage Following TBI
We next examine the role of the major NOX2 isoform of
NADPH oxidase in TBI damage. Fig. 7A shows the results of
double immunohistochemistry for NOX2 and the neuronal
marker, NeuN in the cerebral cortex at 1 h after TBI. The results
show that NOX2 is expressed in the extranuclear membrane
region of cortical cells 1 h after TBI and is highly colocalized in
neurons as evidenced by colocalization with NeuN. To determine
the role of NOX2 in TBI damage in the cortex, we administered a
competitive NOX2 inhibitor, gp91ds-tat, which is a 9 amino acid
peptide inhibitor that binds the p47Phox binding site on NOX2,
preventing activation of NOX2 [32]. A scrambled tat peptide was
also administered as a control. As shown in Fig. 7B (a–b),
pretreatment with gp91ds-tat resulted in significant neuroprotec￾tion against TBI as evidenced by enhanced neuronal density in the
cerebral cortex as compared to the scrambled-tat peptide control.
In addition, we examined the ability of the NOX2 inhibitor to
reduce brain edema following TBI. As shown in Fig. 7C, TBI
induced a significant increase in brain edema in the ipsilateral
hemisphere as compared to the contralateral hemisphere and
sham controls. Pretreatment with gp91ds-tat significantly reduced
brain edema in the ipsilateral hemisphere following TBI.

Discussion
ROS generation and oxidative stress has been implicated to
contribute significantly to neuronal cell death and functional
impairments following TBI [9,10,33]. The current study adds to
our understanding regarding the source of the ROS by
demonstrating that the membrane, via activation of the enzyme
NADPH oxidase, contributes significantly to generation of O2
2 in
the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There are at least five
different isoforms of NADPH oxidase identified to date, termed
NOX 1–5 [14]. The NOX2 isoform has been shown to be highly
expressed in the cortex and hippocampus and to be involved in
oxidative damage following focal and global cerebral ischemia
[15,27,34–36].
In our study, two peaks of NADPH oxidase activation were
observed at 1 h and 24–96 h after TBI, which paralleled
elevations of O2
2. The secondary peak of NADPH oxidase may
have the greater role in neuronal cell death, as apocynin post￾treatment after the first peak of NADPH oxidase (e.g. 2 h after
TBI) still exerted significant neuroprotection, which was statisti￾cally not different from pretreatment (although mean values for
neuronal cell density were 5–15% lower in the post-treatment
group). That NADPH oxidase activation is responsible for the
O2
2 elevations observed in our study was suggested by the fact
that administration of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin
strongly attenuated the elevation of O2
2. O2
2 is well known to be
metabolized to highly toxic free radicals such as hydroxyl ion and
peroxynitrite, which cause oxidative damage to cells and neurons
[37]. Our study showed that NADPH oxidase activation plays an
important role in oxidative damage to neurons following TBI, as
pre- or post-treatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor,
apocynin significantly reduced oxidative damage in the cortex
and hippocampus, as evidenced by assessment of oxidative stress
markers of lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage, and
significant neuroprotection against TBI. Intriguingly, apocynin has
also been shown to reduce ischemic injury and improve outcome
in mouse stroke models [35,38,39], suggesting that NADPH
oxidase activation also has a pathological role in ischemic type
injury in addition to concussion injury. Furthermore, the ability of
apocynin to reduce neuronal cell death, neurological impairment
and mortality in the stroke studies was lost when it was
administered in NOX2 knockout mice, which strongly suggests
that the beneficial neural effects of apocynin are due specifically to
inhibition of NOX2 NADPH oxidase [35].
Our study implicates NOX2 NADPH oxidase as having a
significant role in TBI, as dual immunohistochemistry studies
revealed that NOX2 is highly colocalized in neurons at 1 h after
TBI. Furthermore, pretreatment with the specific NOX2
inhibitor, gp91ds-tat significantly attenuated neuronal damage
and edema following TBI. It should be pointed out that a recent
study using NOX2 mutant knockout mice found that TBI damage
to the brain was likewise significantly attenuated in NOX2
knockout mice as compared to wild type mice [19]. In that study,
which examined only late time-points (24–48 h) after TBI, the
authors concluded that NOX2 activation in microglia at 24–48 h
contributed significantly to neuronal damage following TBI. Our
study examined both early and late time-points after TBI and
found that there are two peaks of NADPH oxidase activation and
O2
2 elevation, an early peak at 1 h and a delayed peak at 24–96 h
after TBI. The first peak appears to be of neuronal origin as
colocalization studies showed strong colocalization of NOX2 and
in situ O2
2 (HEt) signal in neurons at 1 h after TBI. The cellular
source for the NADPH oxidation and O2
2 elevation at 24–96 h is
unclear, but our study showed enhanced microglial activation that
paralleled the NADPH oxidase activation and enhanced O2
2
levels at 24–96 hr. This observation suggests that enhanced
microglia activation likely contributes to the delayed secondary
elevation of NADPH oxidase activation and O2
2 production after
TBI. In support of this possibility, NOX2 knockout mice have
been reported to have significantly reduced generation of O2
2 in
microglia at 24–48 h after TBI [19]. From a functional standpoint,
microglial activation has been implicated to play a role in
mediating the inflammation that occurs after TBI and contribut￾ing to neuronal damage through release of inflammatory cytokines
[40,41]. Microglia have also been shown to enhance beta￾amyloid–induced neurotoxicity [42]. Thus, the attenuation of
microglia activation following NADPH oxidase inhibition could
potentially reduce inflammation and b-amyloid-induced neuro￾toxicity, and facilitate neuronal survival following TBI. In support
of this suggestion, post-treatment with apocynin at 2 h after TBI
was strongly neuroprotective. Previous work has shown that TBI is
also associated with a significantly enhanced risk of cognitive
decline and dementia [31,43]. Intriguingly, TBI has been
demonstrated to induce significant elevations of the AD proteins,
APP and b-amyloid protein in the regions adjacent to the site of
injury [30,44]. Our study confirms elevation of APP and b￾amyloid in the brain following TBI, and extends these observa￾tions by providing evidence that NADPH oxidase activation is
critical for the induction of APP and b-amyloid.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate that
the membrane, via NADPH oxidase activation can contribute
significantly to ROS generation, oxidative stress damage, and
neuronal cell death following TBI. The study also suggests that
targeting NADPH oxidase for inhibition via use of specific
NADPH oxidase inhibitors may have clinical efficacy in TBI.
