Induction chemotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage III with gemcitabine and cisplatin for downstaging of the
tumour with the aim for further treatment with ionising radiation is one of the treatments for lung cancer patients. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the influence of the waiting time for radiotherapy, that is, the interval between induction chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, on the rate of tumour growth for patients with NSCLC. Interval times between the end of induction chemotherapy
and date of diagnostic CT, planning CT and first day of radiotherapy were determined for 23 patients with NSCLC. Increase in gross
tumour volume was measured for 18 patients by measuring the dimensions of the primary tumour and lymph node metastases on
the diagnostic CT after induction chemotherapy and on the CT used for radiotherapy planning. For each patient, the volume doubling
time was calculated from the time interval between the two CTs and ratio of the gross volumes on planning CT and diagnostic CT.
The mean time interval between end of chemotherapy and day of diagnostic CT was 16 days, and till first day of radiotherapy 80.3
(range 29 – 141) days. In all, 41% of potentially curable patients became incurable in the waiting period. The ratio of gross tumour
volumes of the two CTs ranged from 1.1 to 81.8 and the tumour doubling times ranged from 8.3 to 171 days, with a mean value of
46 days and median value of 29 days. This is far less than the mean doubling time of NSCLC in untreated patients found in the
literature. This study shows that in the time interval between the end of induction chemotherapy and the start of radiotherapy rapid
tumour progression occurs as a result of accelerated tumour cell proliferation: mean tumour doubling times are much shorter than
those in not treated tumours. As a consequence, the gain obtained with induction chemotherapy with regard to volume reduction
was lost in the waiting time for radiotherapy. We recommend diminishing the time interval between chemo- and radiotherapy to as
short as possible.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men
(32%) and women (25%) (Perez and Brady, 1998). In the last
decades, there was a sharp increase in the incidence of lung cancer
(Storm et al, 1999; Teppo et al, 1999). About two-third of non￾small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are diagnosed with distant
disease, which restricts the option of radically intended treatment
to less than one-third of patients (Jensen et al, 2002). The results of
radiotherapy alone for lung cancer patients are still disappointing.
Overall, only 5% of patients survived more than 5 years;
locoregional control was about 20% after 5 years and more than
60% of patients developed distant metastases (Fietkau, 2001).
Shortening of the overall treatment time (OTT) improved local
control and survival after radiotherapy of lung cancer patients (Fu
et al, 1997; Bonner et al, 1998; Saunders et al, 1999), indicating the
importance of cellular repopulation as a cause of failure in the
radiotherapy of NSCLC (Saunders et al, 1997; Fowler and Chappell,
2000). Furthermore, tumour progression during the waiting time
till the start of radiotherapy for lung cancer and head-and-neck
tumours, respectively, was reported, indicating a possible negative
influence on treatment results (O’Rourke and Edwards, 2000;
Waaijer et al, 2003). Owing to restaging procedure after induction
chemotherapy and waiting times for radiotherapy, we were
interested to know to what extent the OTT and, in our case, the
waiting period between the end of induction chemotherapy and the
start of radiotherapy might influence tumour behaviour. To our
knowledge, such a study on behaviour of NSCLC after induction
chemotherapy has not been reported yet. The purpose of this study
was to investigate the influence of the waiting time on the rate of
tumour growth in patients with NSCLC treated with induction
chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In the period 1999 –2000, 23 patients with stage III NSCLC received
induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in the
University Medical Centre Utrecht and in 10 regional hospitals.
Gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 –1250 mg m2 on
days 1 and 8, and in some regional hospitals also on day 15.
Cisplatin was given at doses ranging from 80 to 100 mg m2 on
day 1. The treatment was repeated every 3 –4 weeks. In general, the
23 patients received 3 –4 cycles before re-evaluation with CT scan
and 22 were referred to the Radiotherapy Department in Utrecht

with curative intent for stages III-A and downstaged III-B NSCLC.
Patient characteristics – gender, age and histology, curative or
palliative intent – are shown in Table 1.
A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the duration of
the waiting period between the end of induction chemotherapy and
the start of radiotherapy, and to look at tumour volume increase in
that waiting period. CT scans were made for re-evaluation of
tumour response after induction chemotherapy (CTr) at the
referring hospitals and for planning purposes (CTp) at our
Radiotherapy Department. Before CT planning, contrast infusion
was given to all patients. Most of the diagnostic CT and all
planning CT scans were spiral scans. The diagnostic scans were
performed with breath-hold, the planning CT’s during quiet
respiration. Tumour movement as a consequence of both cardiac
and respiratory activity may occur with the greatest average
movement near 1 cm (Ross et al, 1990). However, for the present
analysis of tumour volumes and subsequent tumour volume
doubling times, changes in organ positions would not significantly
affect the analyses of changes in apparent physical volume due to
the state of breathing at the time of CT data acquisition (Balter
et al, 1996). The gross tumour volumes, that is, the sum of the
volume of the primary tumour and that of a lymph node metastasis
if present, Vr at restaging and Vp on planning CT, could be
determined for 18 patients. The delineation of tumour volume on
CT scans was performed using PLATO IPS version 2.7 (Nucletron,
The Netherlands). Tumour volume V was calculated by multi￾plying 0.5 times the maximum diameters in ventral/dorsal dvd and
lateral directions dl and the number n of CT slices in craniocaudal
direction on which the tumour was visible times slice thickness t:
V ¼ 0.5dvddlnt. CTr scans had a slice thickness of 8 –10 mm; CTp
scans had a slice thickness of 5 mm. Measurements were
performed by one observer (SYES) without the involvement of a
radiologist. Most of the restaging CT’s were made in the regional
hospitals and we were not able to use the digital formats of these
CT’s. Therefore, all CT’s for restaging and planning purposes were
analysed using the same method as described. For each patient the
gross tumour volumes Vr and Vp were calculated and with the
time interval T between CTr and CTp, the tumour volume
doubling time Td could be estimated: Td ¼ Tln2/ln(Vp/Vr)
(Hasegawa et al, 2000).
According to our protocol, patients with stage III-B NSCLC
receive palliative radiotherapy and with stage III-A high-dose
radiotherapy with curative intent. In case of downstaging from
stage III-B to III-A or no upgrading from stage III-A to III-B high￾dose locoregional radiotherapy was given. Otherwise, palliative
radiotherapy was given. The given doses for curative intended
radiotherapy was 66 Gy in 33 fractions, 5 times/week, and for
palliative radiotherapy it was 30 Gy in 10 fractions of 3 Gy in 4
fractions/week.
RESULTS
After induction chemotherapy, 23 patients were referred to the
Radiotherapy Department. One patient had complete response and
17 patients had partial response, thus the response rate after
chemotherapy was 78% (18 out of 23 patients). In all, 22 patients
were referred for treatment with curative intent. However, nine out
of these 22 patients (41%) had progression of their disease in the
waiting period to such extent (i.e. upgrading to stage III-B) that
they became ineligible for high-dose radiotherapy. The interval
time between the end of induction chemotherapy and CTr was 15.8
days (range 14 to 33 days; one patient had CTr during
chemotherapy). The interval between CTr and CTp was 52.3 days
(range 16 –99 days), and interval between end of chemotherapy
and first day of radiotherapy was 80.3 days (range 29 –141 days).
The overall treatment time, from the start of the chemotherapy till
the end of radiotherapy varied between 115 and 219 days, Table 2.
Based on CTr and CTp scans, all patients had tumour volume
increase. Gross tumour volumes at CTr varied between 1 and
367 cm3
, at the moment of CTp they varied between 45 and
793 cm3
, Table 3. For the patient with complete response, the
volume at CTr could not be determined, the volume was assumed
to be 1 cm3
. In Figure 1, the CTs of a patient made 78 days before
the induction chemotherapy, 55 days after the start of chemother￾apy and 72 days after the end of chemotherapy for planning
purposes, are shown. It illustrates the efficacy of the induction
chemotherapy and the fast regrowth of the tumour after
chemotherapy. The ratios of gross tumour volumes at CTp and
at CTr are shown in Table 3. It varies from 1.1 to 81.8. The Td
values are shown in Table 3. Td values ranged from 8.3 to 171.4
days with a mean of 45.8 days and a median value of 29.4 days. The
number of tumour volume doubling times in the waiting period
between the end of induction chemotherapy and the start of
radiotherapy was calculated by dividing waiting time by tumour
volume doubling time, Table 3. The number of Td’s as a function
of the waiting period is also presented in Figure 2. Although the
correlation coefficient is rather low, it demonstrates that the
number of Td’s increases for longer waiting periods. The number
of Td’s in the waiting period ranges from 0.3 to 10, the mean is 3.3
and the median value is 2.7.
The tumour doubling times as a function of the volume as
determined with CTr (starting volume) are shown in Figure 3. It
illustrates that the tumours with the smallest starting volumes after
chemotherapy had the fastest Td, indicating fast proliferating of
the tumour cells surviving the induction chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Waiting time
In the last years, delays in starting radiotherapy is becoming an
increasing problem. Apart from the psychological distress for the
patients, the question is whether waiting times and delays have any
bearing on prognosis and treatment. Specifically, the hypothesis is
raised that longer delays are associated with poorer survival or
more advanced stage disease. A strong independent association
between tumour volume and survival in patients with NSCLC was
reported (Etiz et al, 2002; Bradley et al, 2002; Willner et al, 2002). It
was recommended that waiting times for radiotherapy should be as
short as reasonably achievable (ASARA) (Mackillop et al, 1996).
Delay in treatment increases the risk that metastases will develop
before treatment is started. Treatment delay may also lead to
increased complication rate. As tumours increase in size, larger
volumes of normal tissue have to be irradiated to encompass them,
and the probability of radiation complications increases as a
function of the volume irradiated.
O’Rourke and Edwards (2000) described that in the waiting
period for potentially curative radiotherapy that lasted from 35 to
187 days, six of their 29 lung cancer patients (21%) became
incurable. An even larger percentage of patients in our study
became incurable, nine of 22 potentially curable patients (41%)
were treated with palliative intent after a waiting period ranging
from 29 to 141 days. These nine patients had progression of their
tumour to stage III-B at the time of planning CT and became
ineligible for high-dose radiotherapy.
Waaijer et al (2003) investigated tumour growth of orophar￾yngeal tumours in the waiting time for radiotherapy and estimated
an average control loss of 16 –19% for these tumours during the
waiting time.
Fortin et al (2002) concluded that delaying radiotherapy had a
deleterious effect on patients with early head-and-neck squamous
cell carcinomas. Radiotherapy should be started as soon as
possible, preferably within 20 –30 days after evaluation by a
radiation oncologist.
Among patients with an upper aerodigestive tract cancer,
professional delays of more than 1 month contributed to an
increased risk for being diagnosed with late-stage disease (Allison
et al, 1998). However, no significant correlation between waiting
time and the outcome of early-stage laryngeal and nasopharyngeal
cancers was found (Barton et al, 1997; Brouha et al, 2000). Lee et al
(1993) however, have shown that advanced stage of head-and-neck
tumours have a clear negative effect on treatment results. From the
above reports, we conclude that long waiting times and delays may
lead to important deterioration in local control rates.
In the present study, we observed a large variety in waiting times
for radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy varying from 29 to
141 days and an increase in tumour volume in all patients.
Pulmonologists and radiotherapists made the decision for
combined chemo/radiotherapy for NSCLC patients in our region;
however, patients were referred only after postchemotherapy
evaluation to the department of radiotherapy. The causes of the
long waiting times, therefore, are the restaging procedure after the
induction chemotherapy, the time to overcome possible side
effects of the chemotherapy, the time till referring patients as well
as the waiting time from referring the patient till the start of
radiotherapy (waiting time for the first visit, for performing the
planning CT and for the start of radiotherapy). In that waiting
period, we observed an increase in the gross tumour volume with a
factor of more than 3. This volume increase, however, is faster after
induction chemotherapy than in untreated tumours.
Repopulation and tumour doubling time
There are many publications on experimental tumours that have
shown rates of repopulation after radiotherapy that are equal to or
often faster than the rates of cell repopulation in tumours without
radiotherapy (Hermens and Barendsen, 1967; Suit and Urano,
1969; Abe et al, 1991; Begg et al, 1991; Milas et al, 1994). Intervals
between chemotherapy doses are needed to allow repopulation of
normal tissues. During these intervals, however, the surviving
tumour cells can proliferate and repopulate (Stephens and
Peacock, 1977; Rosenblum et al, 1976; 1983; Milas et al, 1994).
Data on tumour volume doubling time (Td) for human lung
tumours are reported by Hasegawa et al (2000), Steel (1977),
Usuda et al (1994), Fujimura et al (1979), Filderman et al (1986)

and Geddes (1979). The data are summarised in Table 4. They
indicate that for untreated NSCL tumours the mean Td is in excess
of 93 days. O’Rourke and Edwards (2000) reported that the delay
between diagnostic CT scan and planning CT amounted 18 –131
days with a median of 54 days. Tumour growth in terms of
percentage change in tumour cross-sectional area ranged from 0 to
373% with a median increase of 19%. If this value of 19% is used
for the median interval of 54 days, a Td of 68 days can be derived,
and for an interval of 113 days, the Td is 143 days.
In the present study, we observed after induction chemotherapy
a clear progression in tumour volume with Td’s varying from 8.3
to 171.4 days with a mean and median value of 45.8 and 29.4 days,
respectively. This latter Td value is far less than Td’s found for
untreated NSCLC, Table 4. It indicates accelerated repopulation of
cells surviving the induction chemotherapy course. Our findings
are in line with those of others who observed a rapid regrowth after
irradiation of pulmonary metastases (Battermann et al, 1981), and
after surgery in head-and-neck cancer (Trotti et al, 1998; Ang et al,
2001; Awwad et al, 2002). In their review, Davis and Tannock

(2000) reported on repopulation of tumour cells between cycles of
chemotherapy as a neglected factor. We can conclude that fast
regrowth of remaining tumour cells occurs after induction
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.
As illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 3, the number of Td’s in the
waiting period ranges from 0.3 to 10. The mean number is 3.3.
Thus, in the waiting period the tumour volume increases with a
factor of more than 3.
As shown in Figure 3, the small tumours have the shortest Td.
For instance, tumours with a volume up to 40 cm3 have a mean Td
of 24.5 days (range 8.3 –46.9 days). To our knowledge such a short
mean Td value for lung tumours has not been reported earlier.
Hasegawa et al (2000) determined growth rate of small lung
cancers detected on mass CT screening. The shortest Td they
found was 52 days. From the CT scans inserted in Figure 1 in the
paper by O’Rourke and Edwards (2000), a Td of 18.3 days can be
derived. This value is for a patient receiving prior chemotherapy
(O’Rourke, pers. com., 2003) and confirms our findings that after
induction chemotherapy fast regrowth occurs. In our study, the
shortest Td was 8.3 days.
In conclusion, we present evidence that after induction
chemotherapy fast regrowth of NSCLC occurs and that accelerated
repopulation of surviving tumour cells is responsible for the fast
regrowth. It is clear that the beneficial result of induction
chemotherapy, that is, tumour volume regression, has faded away.
The Td is far shorter than that of untreated lung tumours. This
influences the treatment results significantly. It is tragically that
interval times up to more than 3 months are found whereas
radiotherapy can be started within 1 month after induction
chemotherapy as observed here. In all, 41% of potentially curable
patients became incurable in that waiting period. We recommend
that radiotherapy should start as soon as possible, preferably
within 2 –3 weeks, after the last chemotherapy cycle. Owing to the
accelerated cell proliferation observed, accelerated radiotherapy
should be given serious consideration to keep overall treatment
time short. In further studies, concurrent chemo/radiotherapy
treatment should be considered since a growing body of data show
that concurrent chemo/radiotherapy improves survival in selected
patients in stage III NSCLC (Schaake-Koning et al, 1994; Furuse
et al, 1999; Curran et al, 2003).
