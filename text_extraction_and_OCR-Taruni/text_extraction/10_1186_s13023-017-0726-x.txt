Abstract
Hereditary ATTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis (also called transthyretin-type familial amyloid polyneuropathy [ATTR-FAP]) is
an autosomal-dominant, adult-onset, rare systemic disorder predominantly characterized by irreversible, progressive,
and persistent peripheral nerve damage. TTR gene mutations (e.g. replacement of valine with methionine at
position 30 [Val30Met (p.Val50Met)]) lead to destabilization and dissociation of TTR tetramers into variant TTR
monomers, which form amyloid fibrils that deposit in peripheral nerves and various organs, giving rise to
peripheral and autonomic neuropathy and several non-disease specific symptoms.
Phenotypic and genetic variability and non–disease-specific symptoms often delay diagnosis and lead to
misdiagnosis. Red-flag symptom clusters simplify diagnosis globally. However, in Japan, types of TTR variants, age of
onset, penetrance, and clinical symptoms of Val30Met are more varied than in other countries. Hence, development
of a Japan-specific red-flag symptom cluster is warranted. Presence of progressive peripheral sensory-motor
polyneuropathy and ≥1 red-flag sign/symptom (e.g. family history, autonomic dysfunction, cardiac involvement,
carpal tunnel syndrome, gastrointestinal disturbances, unexplained weight loss, and immunotherapy resistance)
suggests ATTR-FAP. Outside of Japan, pharmacotherapeutic options are first-line therapy. However, because of
positive outcomes (better life expectancy and higher survival rates) with living donor transplant in Japan, liver
transplantation remains first-line treatment, necessitating a Japan-specific treatment algorithm.
Herein, we present a consolidated review of the ATTR-FAP Val30Met landscape in Japan and summarize findings
from a medical advisory board meeting held in Tokyo on 18th August 2016, at which a Japan-specific ATTR-FAP
red-flag symptom cluster and treatment algorithm was developed. Beside liver transplantation, a TTR-stabilizing
agent (e.g. tafamidis) is a treatment option. Early diagnosis and timely treatment using the Japan-specific red-flag
symptom cluster and treatment algorithm might help guide clinicians regarding apt and judicious use of available
treatment modalities.

Background
Transthyretin-type familial amyloid polyneuropathy
(ATTR-FAP), or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis
(ATTRm amyloidosis), is an autosomal-dominant, adult￾onset, rare systemic disorder predominantly characterized
by irreversible, progressive, and persistent peripheral
nerve damage [1, 2]. ATTR-FAP can present as a progres￾sive, axonal, sensory autonomic and motor neuropathy,
restrictive cardiomyopathy (transthyretin cardiomyop￾athy), or as a cerebral amyloid angiopathy; however, most
cases are classified as neuropathic [1]. In analysis of data
from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan
(MHLW), during 2003–2005, 110.8–135.4 cases of famil￾ial amyloidosis were found, equating to an estimated
prevalence of 0.87–1.1 per 1,000,000 persons; the highest
prevalence was in the Nagano prefecture, followed by
Kumamoto, and Ishikawa (11.0–15.5, 10.1–10.3, and 3.5–
4.2 per 1,000,000 persons, respectively) [3].
TTR—a homotetramer plasma transport protein that
carries thyroxine and retinol-binding protein—is produced
primarily in the liver but also in the choroid plexus and
retinal pigment epithelium, and is secreted into the blood,
cerebrospinal fluid, and eye, respectively [1, 4–9].
There are over 130 different TTR gene mutations
identified worldwide, of which >40 mutations are linked
with ATTR-FAP in Japan (Table 1). However, replace￾ment of valine with methionine at position 30 (ATTR￾FAP Val30Met [p.Val50Met]) is the most commonly
observed mutation, the only one found in large foci of
patients, and is associated primarily with neuropathy
[1, 10]. TTR gene mutations destabilize TTR, leading
to dissociation of tetramers and partial unfolding of
resultant monomers. Variant TTR monomers aggregate to
form amyloid fibrils [1, 11–13]. Because of diffuse amyloid
fibril deposition (e.g. in the extracellular space in periph￾eral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, eyes,
meninges, vessels, and connective tissue of the transverse
carpal ligament) [14], ATTR-FAP is associated with vari￾ous symptoms, many of which are non-specific [1, 11, 15].
Disease onset, which occurs between the 10s and 90s, is
generally classified as early-onset (<50 years old) and late￾onset (≥50 years old) [16, 17]. Within approximately
10 years of disease onset, progressive organ dysfunction
and death (due to cardiac dysfunction, infection, or cach￾exia) occur [1, 18–21]. Several studies have indicated that
onset of ATTR-FAP symptoms in Japan is bimodal, with
one peak occurring in the 30s to 40s (early-onset) and an￾other distinct peak in the 60s (late-onset) [1, 3, 16, 22–24].
In contrast, other countries have a single peak of symptom
onset (e.g. between 25 and 35 years with a mean of
33.5 years in Portugal and in the 50s or 60s in Sweden)
[25–27] (Fig. 1; Pfizer Inc., data on file).
In addition to heterogeneity of amyloidogenic TTR
mutations and variability in the age of onset, phenotypic
heterogeneity at various levels makes ATTR-FAP diag￾nosis challenging. Carriers of the same TTR point muta￾tion may exhibit very different clinical manifestations,
even among family members [1]. Also, absence of family
history in non-endemic areas, and sporadic cases present
additional diagnostic challenges [28–31]. As ATTR-FAP
is a progressive disease and can cause largely irreversible
tissue damage, timely recognition and diagnosis are crit￾ical for appropriate treatment and optimal outcomes
[32–34]. Unfortunately, diagnosis of ATTR-FAP is often
delayed because of phenotypic and genetic variability,
varied clinical presentation, and the non-specific nature
of most symptoms [1, 19, 30, 31, 35]. Misdiagnosis also
may occur for similar reasons (see Common diagnostic
pitfalls).
In the past decade, the situation surrounding ATTR￾FAP and its treatment has changed dramatically in Japan:
owing to heightened awareness of the disease, the number
of ATTR-FAP patients in this country has reportedly
increased from 110.8–135.4 [3] to approximately 300
(Sekijima et al., unpublished observations). In terms of
treatment, liver transplantation (LT) has been the only
standard of care since the 1990s [1, 36–41]; in the early
2010s, however, treatment options were widened by the
advent of minimally invasive, disease-modifying pharma￾cotherapy such as TTR tetramer stabilizer [1, 35, 42].
Nevertheless, a number of patients with ATTR-FAP still
remain undiagnosed and thus untreated because of diverse
clinical presentations and various non-specific symptoms
of the disease; especially in Japan, presence of diverse
types of patients (e.g. early-onset Val30Met in endemic
areas, late-onset Val30Met in non-endemic areas,
non-Val30Met variants whose cardinal symptoms are
cardiomyopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, or cerebral
amyloid angiopathy) often makes accurate diagnosis
difficult [15, 16, 24, 43–45].

In view of the enormous possibility of misdiagnosis or
delayed diagnosis, Conceição and colleagues reported
red-flag symptom clusters suggestive of ATTR-FAP and
treatment algorithms [46]. However, these clusters and
algorithms are not necessarily applicable to Japan
because situations specific to this country (e.g. presence
of diverse types of patients) are not fully reflected.
Herein, we provide a consolidated review of the world￾wide landscape of ATTR-FAP and our treatment experi￾ence in Japanese ATTR-FAP patients to propose revised
red-flag symptom clusters and treatment algorithm.
Methods
The authors (YS, MU, HK, SM, and YA) held a medical
advisory board meeting in Tokyo, Japan on 18th August
2016 with the aim to promote early diagnosis and to
stipulate consensus on diagnosis and management of
ATTR-FAP Val30Met in Japan. The red-flag symptom
clusters and treatment algorithm presented in this article
are developed as per findings from this medical advisory
board meeting.
Clinical features
ATTR-FAP Val30Met can be endemic (i.e. localized to a
small area, with a traceable family history and early￾onset of the disease) or non-endemic (i.e. scattered,
frequently without family history, and late-onset of the
disease) [3, 16, 29–31, 34, 47]. The clinical picture of
ATTR-FAP differs between patients from endemic and
non-endemic areas [1, 15, 16, 48]. Generally, patients
from endemic areas have early-onset disease, while
those from non-endemic areas have late-onset disease
[15, 16, 20, 44, 49]. In Japan, however, despite an
identical TTR genotype and generally homogenous
ethnic background, two major ATTR-FAP Val30Met
phenotypes have been identified: early-onset and en￾demic (Nagano and Kumamoto), and late-onset and
non-endemic [16, 20, 31]. Common clinical features
of the early-onset and endemic phenotype in Japan
resemble those of Portuguese FAP patients [10, 27, 50,
51], while clinical features of the late-onset phenotype
in non-endemic areas are distinct from those pheno￾types [16, 20, 31]. Differences in clinical features be￾tween early-onset and late-onset disease are presented in
Table 2. Early-onset ATTR-FAP generally starts between
the late 20s to the early 40s and is characterized by pre￾dominant loss of superficial sensation including nocicep￾tion and thermal sensation (i.e. sensory dissociation),
presence of family history, high penetrance rate, severe
autonomic dysfunction, and atrioventricular conduction
block requiring pacemaker implantation [15, 16, 49, 52–
54]. On the other hand, late-onset disease starts after
50 years of age and is characterized by sensorimotor
symptoms beginning in the distal lower extremities, initial
involvement of both superficial and deep sensation, loss of
all sensory modalities rather than sensory dissociation,
low penetrance rate, relatively mild autonomic dysfunc￾tion, frequent presence of cardiomegaly, and extreme male
preponderance [15, 16, 24, 31, 55]. Genetic anticipation is
frequently considered a differentiating feature due to its
presence in early-onset disease and its absence in late￾onset disease [43, 56]. However, the occurrence of antici￾pation may be overestimated since not all asymptomatic
individuals undergo molecular genetic testing, and hence
some asymptomatic individuals with the Val30Met variant
may not be identified [57].

The clinical and paraclinical features of ATTR-FAP are
presented in Fig. 2. In general, fiber length-dependent
peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy is a hallmark
feature of ATTR-FAP [1, 15]. A number of previously
reported studies have discussed initial symptoms in
ATTR-FAP patients in Japan [15, 16, 20, 31, 45, 46, 50].
The initial symptoms in Japanese ATTR-FAP patients
are presented in Table 3. Symptoms of ATTR-FAP can
be broadly divided into neuropathic symptoms and other
systemic symptoms as described below.
Neuropathic symptoms
In classical early-onset disease, damage is first ob￾served in distal small myelinated and unmyelinated
nerve fibers associated with pain and temperature
and manifests as paresthesia, dysesthesia, allodynia,

hyperalgesia, or spontaneous pain in the feet [15, 16]
and impaired thermal sensitivity with decreased pin￾prick sensation on clinical examination [1, 15, 16].
Larger myelinated sensory and motor nerve fibers are
affected over the following years, impairing light
touch, vibration, and position sensation. Further
length-dependent progression leads to distal lower
limb motor deficit, resulting in walking difficulty and
weakness [15]. In late-onset disease, unmyelinated
nerve fibers are preserved, and axonal sprouting is
observed [15]. Autonomic dysfunction presents as
sexual impotence; disturbances of gastrointestinal
motility, most commonly diarrhea alternating with
constipation but also constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and
vomiting; orthostatic hypotension; and neurogenic bladder
[16, 20, 58]. These autonomic symptoms are relatively
mild in late-onset disease particularly in the early phase of
neuropathy [16, 20]. Symptoms of the lower limbs usually
precede those of the upper limbs by several years in early￾onset disease, while the involvement of the upper and
lower limbs may appear simultaneously in late-onset dis￾ease [20]. Occasionally carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)
may appear in the patients with non-Val30Met and lead to
diagnosis in the progression of systemic neuropathy after
carpal tunnel release surgery [1, 59–62].
Other systemic symptoms
In addition to nervous tissue, amyloid fibrils may deposit
in various organs and tissues resulting in progressive
dysfunction [1, 14, 15, 63–66]. Amyloid deposition in
the media and adventitia of medium-sized and small
arteries, arterioles, and, occasionally, veins of the sub￾arachnoid space, leptomeninges, and cerebral cortex
leads to transient focal neurological episodes, cerebral in￾farction and hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, ataxia, spastic
paralysis, convulsion, and dementia [1, 61, 62, 64, 67]. In￾filtration of amyloid fibrils in cardiovascular structures
such as the conduction system may lead to bundle branch
block and, occasionally, atrioventricular and sinoatrial
block [15]. Myocardial infiltration may lead to cardiomy￾opathy, with a hypertrophic phenotype and restrictive
pathophysiology [1, 68]. Deposition of amyloid fibrils in
the eye may cause ocular manifestations such as abnormal
conjunctival vessels, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, pupillary

abnormality, vitreous opacity, and glaucoma [69]. Amyloid
fibril deposition in the kidney might lead to micro￾albuminuria, which often precedes subjective symptoms
of ATTR-FAP. Renal involvement, including nephritic
syndrome and progressive renal failure, occurs in about
one-third of patients in Portugal [70]; however, severe
renal dysfunction rarely occurs in Japanese ATTR-FAP pa￾tients. Further, as the kidney is the major site of erythro￾poietin production, anemia might develop because of
significantly lower serum erythropoietin levels [71].
Non-specific symptoms
Weight loss, muscle wasting and atrophy, hoarseness, cold￾ness, decreased skin temperature, dyscoria, dysesthesia,
dissociated anesthesia, arrhythmia, edema, burning, and
Charcot’s joint also may be present in patients with ATTR￾FAP [1, 16].
Japan-specific red flag symptom clusters
Heritability and multisystem involvement are character￾istic features of ATTR-FAP [46]. Red-flag symptom
clusters suggestive of ATTR-FAP reported by Conceição
and colleagues included: family history; early autonomic
dysfunction; gastrointestinal complaints; unexplained
weight loss; cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, ven￾tricular blocks, or cardiomyopathy; bilateral CTS;
renal abnormalities; and vitreous opacities [46]. In the
light of published literature and the medical advisory
board’s expert opinion, red-flag symptom clusters sug￾gesting ATTR-FAP in Japan are reviewed and pre￾sented below (Fig. 3). The presence of progressive
peripheral sensory-motor polyneuropathy and ≥1 of
the following red-flag signs and/or symptoms is sug￾gestive of ATTR-FAP.
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, early satiety,
recurrent vomiting, watery diarrhea, severe constipation,
and/or alternating diarrhea and constipation that occur
as manifestations of autonomic neuropathy are docu￾mented early on in ATTR-FAP [1] and are the initial
symptoms in nearly half of early-onset cases in endemic
areas [16, 72, 73]. Patients from non-endemic areas
mainly present with lower gastrointestinal tract symp￾toms such as diarrhea and/or constipation [20]. Notably,
Japanese patients have an earlier onset of gastrointestinal
disturbances than Swedish patients [74], making it an
important red-flag symptom in Japanese patients.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
CTS is an early but non-specific orthopedic manifest￾ation of ATTR-FAP. Often, ATTR-FAP patients are ini￾tially misdiagnosed with idiopathic CTS, and progressive
symptoms or lack of improvement after release surgery
often leads to the correct diagnosis. Therefore, CTS
without obvious cause, particularly bilateral CTS that re￾quires surgical release, should raise suspicion of ATTR￾FAP [1]. In a retrospective, observational study involving
76 Italian ATTR-FAP patients, CTS was an inaugural
symptom in 33% patients, with no other clinical
manifestations for a mean period of 4.6–5.6 years [75].
Likewise, in a study involving 31 Japanese patients di￾agnosed with systemic wild-type transthyretin amyl￾oidosis at Shinshu University Hospital, CTS was the
most common initial symptom, indicating that careful
examination of patients with CTS may lead to earlier
diagnosis [76].
Unexplained weight loss
Unintentional weight loss is frequently observed in
ATTR-FAP patients because of gastrointestinal distur￾bances [1]. Cachexia is a major cause of death in early￾onset ATTR-FAP Val30Met patients from endemic foci
in Japan and Portugal [50, 73, 77].
Autonomic dysfunction
Although sensory and motor manifestations are gener￾ally presenting symptoms, autonomic dysfunction can be
the first clinical presentation in early-onset cases [49]. In
a nationwide survey conducted by the Study Group for
Hereditary Neuropathy (under the auspices of the
MHLW), autonomic dysfunction was the initial com￾plaint in 48% of early-onset and 10% of late-onset cases
[16]. Autonomic symptoms in late-onset ATTR-FAP are
generally mild in the early phase of the disease [31].
However, autonomic dysfunction usually becomes appar￾ent in the later phase of the disease, even in late-onset
cases [20]. Further, as inadequate attention of neurolo￾gists to autonomic symptoms is a major diagnostic pitfall
in ATTR-FAP, special attention must be paid to patients
with concurrent autonomic dysfunction, CTS, and
cardiac involvement [1, 19, 31].
Cardiac involvement
Approximately 50% of patients with ATTR-FAP experi￾ence cardiac disease [1], and cardiac dysfunction is the
major cause of death, particularly among patients from
non-endemic areas [20, 78]. Although signs and symp￾toms of cardiac disease generally appear in the later phase
of ATTR-FAP, early assessments might reveal cardiac in￾volvement [20]. Detection of subclinical cardiac involve￾ment (e.g. cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, and thickening of
the interventricular septum and granular sparkling on
echocardiography [31]) may help diagnose late-onset
ATTR-FAP Val30Met in patients without a family history
of the disease [79]. Furthermore, detection of uptake of
technetium-99m-pyrophosphate with cardiac scintigraphy
Sekijima et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:6 Page 6 of 17

helps early diagnosis of TTR-cardiac amyloidosis with
high sensitivity and specificity [80, 81].
Family history
In the aforementioned nationwide survey conducted in
Japan, family history of ATTR-FAP Val30Met was found
in 94% of early-onset and 48% of late-onset cases [16].
Despite a lower incidence of family history among pa￾tients with late-onset disease and those in non-endemic
areas [16, 24, 79], red-flag symptom clusters should raise
suspicion of ATTR-FAP, particularly in those with a fam￾ily history. Further, experienced neurologists in endemic
areas might possibly diagnose ATTR-FAP solely based
on family history and clinical features [1, 46].
Immunotherapy resistance
Failure to respond to immunomodulatory treatment
helps to differentiate ATTR-FAP from chronic inflam￾matory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), which is
the most common misdiagnosis if associated with steady
progression of the neuropathy, an axonal pattern, and
autonomic dysfunction [31, 46].
The knowledge and awareness of the above red-flag
symptom cluster among physicians in Japan may provide
practical direction and promote early identification and
diagnosis of the disease in this country.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of ATTR-FAP involves two primary steps [82]:
1. Patient history and physical examination, which may
raise clinical suspicion and permit a tentative
diagnosis of ATTR-FAP
2. Confirmation using accurate diagnostic tools,
including histopathology and genetic analysis (Fig. 4)
Patient history and physical examination
A thorough clinical history of the patient should be
taken to identify the presence of family history and the
multisystem red-flag signs and/or symptoms [1, 82]. In
Fig. 3 Red-flag symptom clusters specific to ATTR-FAP Val30Met in Japan. E early-onset Val30Met, L late-onset Val30Met, N non-Val30Met, BNP brain

the absence of a family history of amyloidosis, the diag￾nosis of ATTR-FAP should be considered in patients
with a progressive, length-dependent, axonal polyneur￾opathy predominantly affecting temperature and pain
sensation [1] (Fig. 4). After diagnosis, the modified body
mass index (mBMI) as a measure of nutritional status is
helpful to monitor progression or prognosis of ATTR￾FAP [1, 83].
Histopathology
Tissue biopsy: Demonstrating amyloid deposits via tissue
biopsy is essential to confirm an ATTR-FAP diagnosis,
especially in patients without a family history [1, 84, 85].
Tissue biopsy using Congo red stain [85] directly reveals
amyloid deposits in affected tissues, including the labial
salivary gland and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue,
gastrointestinal tract, nerve tissue, and other organs with
evidence of involvement [18, 31, 86–90]. TTR immunola￾beling of amyloid deposits helps identify TTR amyloidosis
[82] but does not aid differentiation between wild-type
ATTR (ATTRwt) and mutant ATTR (ATTRm). Further,
in the presence of typical signs and symptoms, negative
biopsy results do not rule out ATTR-FAP [1] (Fig. 4).
Genetic testing
In patients with suspected ATTR-FAP, TTR genotyping
should be performed to document the specific patho￾genic TTR mutations; genotyping is the most reliable
diagnostic approach, and absence of a pathogenic muta￾tion excludes diagnosis of ATTR-FAP [1, 82]. TTR geno￾positivity should be established by DNA analysis in all
suspected cases [1, 30, 91–93]. In patients having family
history with previous diagnosis, a targeted approach can
be used to detect the pathogenic mutation. In the
absence of family history and in patients with atypical
symptoms, TTR gene sequencing may be required to de￾tect suspected and new pathogenic mutations [35, 57].
Further, an online registry will prove useful to investigate
amyloidogenic TTR mutations [94] (Fig. 4).
Serum variant TTR protein
TTR protein normally circulates in serum as a soluble
protein with a tetrameric structure. The normal serum
TTR concentration is 0.20 to 0.40 mg/mL (20 to 40 mg/
dL) [57, 95, 96]. After immunoprecipitation with anti￾TTR antibody and dissociation of the tetrameric struc￾ture of TTR (into pro-amyloidogenic monomers), serum

variant TTR protein can be detected by mass spectrom￾etry [97–100]. Approximately 90% of TTR variants are
identified by this method and they exhibit the mass shift
predicted by the one amino acid substitution of the
variant TTR [57, 97, 101] (Fig. 4).
Neurologic examination
On the basis of presenting signs and symptoms, patients
should undergo a complete neurological examination to
identify, characterize, and measure the severity of neuro￾pathic abnormalities involving small and large nerve fi￾bers [1, 82]. Scores used to assess neuropathy, and local
variants and scales that quantify neurologic function in
patients with diabetic polyneuropathy but are useful for
patients with ATTR-FAP, should also be used to assess
neuropathic symptoms [1]. Likewise, nerve conduction
velocity, sensory action potentials, and other tests for
characterizing small-fiber (coolness and heat detection)
and large-fiber (vibratory detection) peripheral sensory
thresholds should be used to evaluate ATTR-FAP pro￾gression [1] (Fig. 4).
Following diagnosis and assessment of neurological
symptoms, systemic extension of the disease should be de￾termined via assessment of heart, eyes, kidney, etc. [1, 82].
Cardiac evaluation
Cardiac investigations should be conducted to detect
infiltrative cardiomyopathy and serious conduction
disorders carrying risk of sudden death [1] (Fig. 4).
Ophthalmologic evaluation
Ophthalmological assessment is necessary to identify pos￾sible ocular manifestations such as keratoconjunctivitis
sicca, secondary glaucoma, vitreous opacities, or pupillary
abnormalities [69, 102] (Fig. 4).
Kidney evaluation
In view of possible microalbuminuria, and/or mild azo￾temias and subsequent renal failure, monitoring for pro￾teinuria and abnormal renal function (creatinine
clearance and albuminuria) parameters is recommended
in ATTR-FAP patients [70, 82, 103].
Common diagnostic pitfalls
Though length-dependent sensory-motor polyneurop￾athy is a hallmark feature of ATTR-FAP, it is not dis￾tinctive of this condition and can be present in more
prevalent neurological conditions, potentially leading to
misdiagnoses [82, 92].
CIDP
CIDP, which is characterized by a demyelinating
sensory-motor neuropathy, is the most common neuro￾pathic misdiagnosis for sporadic ATTR-FAP. In one
study, 53% of 15 Japanese patients with sporadic ATTR￾FAP Val30Met were initially misdiagnosed with CIDP
[31, 34]. Electrophysiological characteristics of ATTR￾FAP can resemble those of CIDP; however, no symptoms
of autonomic dysfunction are present [30, 31]. Cerebro￾spinal fluid protein levels are elevated to a greater extent
than those seen in ATTR-FAP [30, 92]. Also, a nerve bi￾opsy revealing congophilic deposit differentiates ATTR￾FAP from CIDP [1]. ATTR-FAP should be suspected in
patients diagnosed with CIDP that do not respond to
immunomodulatory treatment if associated with steady
progression of the neuropathy, an axonal pattern, and
dysautonomia [30, 31, 46, 92].
AL amyloidosis
ATTR amyloidosis often was misdiagnosed as AL
amyloidosis because of a high incidence of monoclonal
gammopathy in elderly patients or false immunolabeling
of amyloid deposits. However, this misdiagnosis can be
avoided by careful typing of the amyloid precursor
protein and genetic testing [1, 30, 91–93].
Other common misdiagnoses include idiopathic
axonal polyneuropathy, other types of inherited sensory
polyneuropathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic
neuropathies, Fabry’s disease, leprous neuropathy,
mimicking neuropathies due to diabetes or chronic
alcoholism, Charcot–Marie–Tooth neuropathy or motor
neuron disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, anxiety, and
vitamin B12 deficiency [1, 18, 104].
Management
The management of ATTR-FAP involves three primary
steps [82]:
1. Disease-modifying targeted therapy to prevent
further production of amyloid deposits (e.g. LT,
transthyretin kinetic stabilizers such as tafamidis,
diflunisal) [1, 35]
2. Symptomatic therapy of sensorimotor and
autonomic polyneuropathy and cardiac, renal, and
ocular injury [1, 35]
3. Genetic counseling and supportive care [1, 105]
Unlike European countries that have adopted pharma￾cotherapeutic treatment options for ATTR-FAP, LT
remains first-line treatment in Japan [42, 106]. The
Japan-specific ATTR-FAP treatment algorithm [107–109]
developed at a medical advisory board meeting in Tokyo
suggests that ATTR-FAP patients in Japan should initially
be evaluated for presence of indications for LT. In patients
who do not meet these indications, tafamidis should be
administered. When indicated, patients should be further
assessed for the presence of risk factors of cardiac dys￾function after LT. Patients without risk factors should
Sekijima et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:6 Page 9 of 17

undergo LT and be administered tafamidis until LT. Pa￾tients with risk factors may either undergo LT (tafamidis
could be prescribed until transplantation) or may only be
prescribed tafamidis (Fig. 5). Although ATTR-FAP disease
duration <5 years is one of the indications for LT, some
patients with mild symptoms, who meet other criteria
may be considered for LT even if disease duration (from
onset) is greater than 5 years [56, 110, 111].
LT
Since 1990, LT has been the only potentially curative
and disease-modifying treatment option for ATTR-FAP
patients [1, 36–41]. Serum TTR is mainly produced in
the liver, and LT removes the primary source of mutant
TTR, eliminates approximately 95% of variant TTR, and
can slow or halt disease progression [1, 112–114]. A
study that evaluated histopathological and biochemical
characteristics of abdominal fat amyloid in patients who
had undergone LT over 10 years earlier showed that
tissue-deposited amyloid in FAP patients can gradually
regress over the long term after LT [112]. Results from
the Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy World Trans￾plant Registry (FAPWTR) initiated in 1995 show excel￾lent patient survival (overall 5-year patient survival 77%,
20-year survival 55.3%), which is comparable to the sur￾vival rates seen in LT performed for other chronic liver
disorders [33, 115]. The 20-year retrospective analysis by
the FAPWTR also revealed that early disease onset,
short disease duration, and the Val30Met mutation were
significantly related to decreased mortality in LT patients
(p < 0.001), while sex does not relate to increased
survival for the early-onset LT patients (p = 0.442) [33].
A study of 80 consecutive patients with ATTR-FAP
Val30Met who visited Kumamoto University hospital
between January 1990 and December 2010 showed that
Japanese patients undergoing LT have prolonged survival
(p < 0.001) and higher (100% vs 56.1%) estimated prob￾ability of survival at 10 years after the onset of FAP
[116]. In early-onset disease, significantly (p < 0.001)
improved survival is observed in transplanted patients as
compared to non-transplanted cases. However, in late￾onset disease, survival of transplanted patients does not
differ from that of non-transplanted patients [108]. Also,
while early-onset cases showed no significant difference
in survival after LT between male and female patients,
late-onset disease female transplanted patients had
significantly (p = 0.02) improved survival than male
transplanted cases [108]. It is also noteworthy that 10-
year survival rate after LT was numerically (but not
significantly) better in patients who received a living￾donor liver graft than those who received a graft from a
deceased donor (72.3% vs 33.8%, p = 0.092) [117]. An￾other study of 45 patients with symptomatic ATTR-FAP
showed overall 1- and 5-year survival rates of 82% and
60%, respectively, a marked reduction in circulating mu￾tated TTR levels (2.5% of pre-LT values), and a markedly
lower rate of axonal degeneration (0.9/mm2 vs 70/mm2
of endoneurial area/month in transplanted vs non￾Fig. 5 Treatment algorithm specific to ATTR-FAP Val30Met in Japan. a
Most late-onset ATTR-FAP patients show progression of the disease even
after LT. However, our experience in Japan and evidence in literature suggest a good outcome after LT in some of the late-onset patients;
especially, late-onset females showed significantly improved survival after LT than their male counterparts (p = 0.02, Okamoto S, et al. 2009 [108];
hazard ratio 1.57 [male vs female, p = 0.014], Ericzon BG, et al. 2015 [33]). b
Even in the late-onset cases, LT sometimes show good outcome in
females (Ericzon BG, et al. 2015 [33]). The outcome of LT is comparably good in neuropathic type of non-Val30Met ATTR-FAP patients from our
experience in Kumamoto University Hospital and Shinshu University Hospital in Japan (unpublished observations). LT liver transplantation,
ATTR-FAP transthyretin familial amyloid neuropathy, Val30Met replacement of valine with methionine at position 30 in the TTR gene
Sekijima et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:6 Page 10 of 17

transplanted patients) after LT; LT at first symptom on￾set and exclusion of patients with a Norris score <55
and/or with urinary incontinence have been recom￾mended [118]. Long-term survival after LT can be pre￾dicted by calculating the 5-year risk of death from the
polyneuropathy disability (PND) score, presence or
absence of orthostatic hypotension, New York Heart
Association (NYHA) functional class, QRS duration, and
interventricular septal thickness [119].
Of note, the situation surrounding the use of LT for
ATTR-FAP in Japan is different from that in other areas
of the world. Liver tissue from live donors is used for LT
in Japan, whereas cadaveric liver tissue is used elsewhere
[1]. Consequently, better LT treatment outcomes, includ￾ing higher survival rates post LT, are achieved in Japan
[116]. Therefore, despite the use of a recently approved
therapy tafamidis, which is a first-line treatment option
for patients with early-stage ATTR-FAP in Europe [42],
LT remains the first-line treatment option in Japan,
especially for early-onset ATTR-FAP Val30Met [106].
Despite being a standard therapeutic strategy for
ATTR-FAP, LT has several limitations [113]. Organ
impairment occurring before LT is not reversed [1]. As
seen in the FAPWTR, the outcomes of LT are mutation￾specific (10-year survival rate is 74% for Val30Met vs
44% for non-Val30Met patients; 20-year mortality rate in
Val30Met patients is 61% that of non-Val30Met patients,
p < 0.001) [1, 33]. Further, in some patients, disease pro￾gression occurs even after LT [62, 120]. For example,
progression of cardiac amyloid infiltration continues
post-LT because wild-type TTR continues to deposit on
existing amyloid deposits [121–124]. Likewise, ocular
and leptomeningeal deposits continue to increase after
LT because of local, mutant TTR synthesis in the retinal
epithelium and choroid plexus [61, 62, 113, 125–129].
Hence, although autonomic disturbances decrease post
LT, nerve function rarely improves [1]. Also, in addition
to the risks of surgery, long-term post-LT immunosup￾pressive therapy is required in these patients [1]. Further,
many patients are not suitable candidates for LT, while
in many others LT is not readily accessible [82, 130]. In
addition, the risk of acquired systemic TTR amyloidosis
in patients receiving domino LT should not be underesti￾mated [131].
Pharmacotherapy
As destabilization of the TTR-tetramer along with
misfolding and fibril formation contribute to its pro￾amyloidogenic potential, TTR-tetramer stabilization was
identified as a rate-limiting step and several new
pharmacologic therapies such as TTR stabilizing agents
were evaluated for the treatment of ATTR-FAP. These
can be prescribed at an early stage of disease in anticipa￾tion of LT or to potentially delay the need for LT [1].
Tafamidis
Tafamidis (Vyndaqel®; Pfizer Inc.) approved in Europe in
2011 [42] and in Japan in 2013 is the only prescription
drug for ATTR-FAP [132]. In addition to improved diag￾nostic techniques, availability of tafamidis prompted
earlier diagnosis of cases from non-endemic areas, as it
marked the transformation of ATTR-FAP from an un￾controllable condition into a treatable disease entity.
Tafamidis, a disease-modifying agent, kinetically stabilizes
mutant TTR tetramers and prevents their dissociation
into monomers, which is a critical, rate-limiting step in fi￾bril formation and amyloidogenesis [1, 133–135]. In a ran￾domized, double-blind trial, where early-stage ATTR-FAP
patients received tafamidis meglumine 20 mg (tafamidis
12.2 mg) once daily or placebo for 18 months, although
no differences were observed between the tafamidis and
placebo groups for the Neuropathy Impairment Score–
Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) responder analysis (45.3% vs 29.5%
responders; p = 0.068) and change in Norfolk Quality of
Life Diabetic Neuropathy total score (TQOL; 2.0 vs 7.2;
p = 0.116) in the intent-to-treat population (n = 125), a
significantly greater proportion (60.0% vs 38.1%; p <
0.041) of patients receiving tafamidis were NIS-LL re￾sponders and tafamidis patients had better-preserved
TQOL (0.1 vs 8.9; p = 0.045) in the efficacy-evaluable
population (n = 87). Additionally, patients on tafamidis
had better-preserved TQOL (0.1 vs 8.9; p < 0.045) and
showed 52% less neurologic deterioration with adverse
events (AEs) comparable to patients receiving placebo
[32]. Another 12-month, open-label extension study
that evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability, and ef￾ficacy of tafamidis 20 mg once daily in 86 patients
showed reduced rates of neurological deterioration in
patients treated with tafamidis for 30 months. Further,
patients treated for 30 months had 55.9% greater pres￾ervation of neurologic function (as measured by the
NIS-LL) than those in whom tafamidis was initiated
later, thus demonstrating that early initiation of tafami￾dis was required to slow disease progression. Urinary
tract infection, diarrhea, thermal burn, and nasopharyn￾gitis were some of the most commonly observed AEs in
the tafamidis group. However, no new safety or toler￾ability concerns were identified and the overall inci￾dence of AEs and serious AEs was similar between
tafamidis and placebo groups [42, 136]. Furthermore,
an ongoing long-term, open-label extension study has
revealed that early treatment with tafamidis for up to
5.5 years sustainably delayed neurologic progression
and preserved nutritional status (mean changes from
baseline: NIS-LL, 5.3 points; mBMI, −7.8 kg/m2 × g/L),
without any new safety concerns [137].
In Japan, the efficacy and safety of tafamidis meglu￾mine 20 mg (tafamidis 12.2 mg) once daily in ATTR￾FAP patients (n = 10, male 70%, mean age 60.1 years)
Sekijima et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:6 Page 11 of 17

were evaluated for 1.5 years in a phase III, single-arm,
open-label study [138]. The majority had the Val30Met
mutation (90%) and were late-onset cases (70%, mean
onset age 65.6 years). At week 8 of treatment, TTR
stabilization was achieved in all the 10 patients (primary
endpoint, percent stabilization ≥32%) and maintained
over week 78 in 8 (80%) patients. Treatment with tafa￾midis delayed neuropathic progression (mean [SD] NIS￾LL change at week 78, 3.3 [4.7]), maintained quality of
life (mean [SD] TQOL change at week 78, 10.8 [13.7])
and improved nutritional status (mean [SD] mBMI in￾crease at week 78, 53.7 [81.4]) over the study period.
Nasopharyngitis, muscular weakness, bacterial pneumo￾nia, and thermal burn were the most common AEs. Two
AEs (gingival swelling and sudden death) in two patients
were treatment-related, but no discontinuation due to
AEs was observed [138]. These findings were consistent
with previous tafamidis trials [32, 136] although
generalizability is limited due to the small patient number
and the non-comparative setting.
Diflunisal
Diflunisal, a generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID), also slows the rate of amyloidogenesis by
preventing the dissociation, misfolding, and misassembly
of mutated TTR tetramers. Diflunisal preferentially sta￾bilizes TTR tetramers by increasing the tetramer dissoci￾ation barrier via small molecule binding and by binding
to the 99% unoccupied L-thyroxine binding sites in TTR
[139, 140]. Because of high serum concentrations after
oral administration, diflunisal imposes kinetic stability
on TTR heterotetramers exceeding that of the wild-type
homotetramer and compensates for its modest binding
affinity and selectivity to TTR over all other serum pro￾teins. Thus, diflunisal is the most promising NSAID for
the treatment of TTR amyloidosis [140]. Diflunisal ad￾ministered at a dose of 250 mg twice a day is sufficient
to impose kinetic stabilization on the tetrameric native
state of TTR and achieves kinetic stabilization under
very demanding denaturing conditions. In an inter￾national randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study conducted among 130 ATTR-FAP patients in
Sweden, Italy, Japan, England, and the United States
from 2006 through 2012, polyneuropathy progression
(measured by the Neuropathy Impairment Score plus 7
nerve tests [NIS+7]) was significantly less (NIS+7 score:
8.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.3–14.1] vs 25.0 [95%
CI, 18.4–31.6]) in patients receiving diflunisal. Also, pa￾tients on diflunisal showed significant improvement in
quality of life measures than patients on placebo in whom
quality of life deteriorated. Further, a greater proportion of
patients receiving diflunisal (29.7% vs 9.4%) exhibited
neurological stability at 2 years (<2-point increase in NIS
+7 score; p = 0.007) [141]. A retrospective analysis of off￾label use of diflunisal in patients with ATTR-FAP reported
treatment discontinuation in 57% of patients due to
gastrointestinal side effects [142].
The contraindication for NSAIDs in patients with
severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV) or
renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance
<30 mL/min) may limit its use in ATTR-FAP patients
with cardiac or renal involvement [106, 141, 143].
Although the incidences of cardiac or renal events
were similar in the diflunisal and placebo groups in a
phase III study, two patients in the diflunisal group
discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal bleed￾ing and congestive heart failure, respectively [141].
Because of risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, altered renal
function, or fluid retention, patient selection, management
of anti-inflammatory drug liabilities and long-term
surveillance for AEs may be required [1, 139, 144].
Symptomatic therapy
The immediate goal of ATTR-FAP management is to al￾leviate symptoms; therefore, symptomatic management
of sensory-motor neuropathy and autonomic dysfunc￾tion should be initiated immediately after diagnosis, irre￾spective of presenting symptoms [1]. Symptomatic
treatments include prophylactic pacemaker implantation
to reduce major cardiac events; medications to treat car￾diomyopathy, pain, diarrhea, orthostatic hypotension,
urinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, and cardiac
failure; erythropoietin or iron for anemia; CTS-release
surgery; hemodialysis for renal failure; and vitrectomy or
trabeculectomy for ocular amyloidosis [1, 82, 145]. In a
45-month study, prophylactic pacemaker implantation
mitigated major cardiac events in patients with poly￾neuropathy and conduction disorders [146]. Likewise, in
older ATTR-FAP patients with cardiomyopathy,
stabilization of fluid balance with a goal of reduction in
filling pressure was achieved with very low doses of loop
diuretics [106, 147].
Genetic counseling
Considering that genetic testing is a major tool for
diagnosis and that it helps carrier detection in a
genetic-counseling setting, relatives should be strongly
encouraged to undergo genetic testing and tissue
biopsies (in cases of TTR genopositivity) [1, 34].
However, as genetic testing in patients with a family
history of ATTR-FAP may lead to severe anxiety, gen￾etic counseling and psychological support for patients
and their family members is necessary [1, 34]. Pre￾dictive genetic testing should be carried out in adult
(aged ≥20) relatives of ATTR-FAP patients, once they
are able to understand the medical, social, and
psychological outcomes of a positive genetic test [1].
Also, during genetic counseling, individuals with a
Sekijima et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:6 Page 12 of 17

positive result should be made aware of the disease’s
variable penetrance and the differences in age of
symptom onset [24, 148, 149].
Supportive care
As management of ATTR-FAP is extremely challenging,
it is important to provide patients and their families with
all the social and moral support possible. Efforts should
be intensified to achieve early identification and diagno￾sis. Symptomatic treatment should be initiated immedi￾ately, and a long-term strategy should be devised. The
FAPWTR [150] was established for collaboration and
exchange of experience, monitoring international
transplant activity, and optimization of patient selection,
to ensure satisfactory follow-up after transplant and to
serve as an exploratory research tool for treatment
centers. Other country- and region-specific networks
and centers of excellence also should be established
for exchange of clinical, pathological, and genetic evi￾dence, and sharing of expertise and best management
practices [82].
Emerging therapies
A number of investigational pharmacologic treatments
for ATTR-FAP are in development. Antisense oligo￾nucleotide- and RNA interference-based therapeutics
are two distinct methodologies aimed at reducing total
TTR production [106]. ISIS-TTRRx is an antisense
oligonucleotide-based therapy that causes destruction of
wild type and mutant TTR transcripts. Within 12 weeks
of treatment, ISIS-TTRRx treatment reduced hepatic
TTR mRNA and serum TTR protein levels by 80% in
mouse and non-human primate models [151, 152].
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) employs TTR-targeting, small
interfering RNAs to reduce wild-type and mutant TTR.
In a phase II, open-label, multidose, dose-escalation
study involving 29 patients with stage I or II h-ATTRm
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, patisiran 0.3 mg/kg
every 3 weeks resulted in a maximum mean reduction of
87% in TTR level; a maximum of 96% was attained in
one patient [153]. Likewise, revusiran (ALN-TTRsc), a
subcutaneously administered and TTR-targeting siRNA
conjugated to a triantennary, reduced TTR protein ex￾pression by approximately 80% in non-human primate
models at doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg [154].
Synergistic combination of doxycycline (an in vitro
TTR fibril disrupter) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid
(TUDCA; a biliary acid acting as a potent anti-apoptotic
and anti-oxidant) has demonstrated removal of amyloid
deposits in mouse models [155], and clinical trials
(NCT01855360, NCT01171859) are seeking to replicate
these findings in patients. Finally, endogenous and ex￾ogenous monoclonal antibodies can be used to target
amyloid deposits [106, 156]. A humanized, anti-amyloid,
monoclonal antibody NEOD001 and the combination of
a serum amyloid P depleter (GSK2315698) and an anti￾serum amyloid P monoclonal antibody (GSK2398852)
are being tested in patients with various forms of amyl￾oidosis (NCT01707264, NCT01777243).
Conclusions
Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity may delay diagno￾sis of ATTR-FAP in Japan. The Japan-specific red-flag
symptom clusters proposed herein may simplify diagno￾sis for physicians and prevent misdiagnosis or delayed
diagnosis of ATTR-FAP. Likewise, our consensus-based
ATTR-FAP treatment algorithm, which was also based
on treatment outcomes observed in Japan, may guide
clinicians regarding apt and judicious use of available
treatment modalities.
