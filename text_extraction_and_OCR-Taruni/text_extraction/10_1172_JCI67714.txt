The magnitude of the clinical problem
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents the most common 
blood-borne viral infection without a vaccine, and an estimated 
3% of the world’s population is infected (i.e., approximately 180 
million individuals) (1). Only a minority (~20%) of individuals 
exposed to HCV can spontaneously clear the infection, and most 
infected patients remain undiagnosed (2). HCV-related liver fail￾ure is a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and is a primary 
indication for liver transplantation (3, 4). There have been extra￾ordinary advances in HCV treatment in the last two decades, and 
the current standard of care involves pegylated IFN, ribavirin, and 
as of May 2011, a protease inhibitor targeting genotype 1 (either 
boceprevir or telaprevir) (1). Complicated regimens, drug toxici￾ties, and costs remain significant hurdles for many patients, and 
triple therapy may not be available for the majority of HCV-in￾fected patients (5). Further, approximately one-third of treated 
patients fail to experience a sustained virologic response and 
therefore remain at risk for disease progression, with the propor￾tion being even higher in prior nonresponders and others, all of 
whom comprise the difficult-to-treat patient groups (6). However, 
improved treatments are on the horizon, and in the near future, 
all-oral regimens not requiring IFN and given for shorter treat￾ment durations will become a reality (7).
The virus and the innate hepatocyte response
First cloned in 1989 (8), hepatitis C is an enveloped, posi￾tive-stranded RNA hepacivirus that is approximately 9.6 kb in 
length. Following binding to cell surface proteins and entry by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis (reviewed in refs. 9, 10), HCV 
translation and replication begin in the cytosol. Pattern recogni￾tion receptors (PRRs) play major roles in the recognition of HCV 
RNA, such as retinoic-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which serves as a 
cytoplasmic viral sensor. In addition, the PRR toll-like receptor 3 
(TLR-3) recognizes extracellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) 
generated from virus released from an infected cell and subse￾quently relocalizes to the endosome. A single-point mutation in 
RIG-I and a lack of TLR-3 expression in the human hepatocellular 
carcinoma–derived cell line Huh-7.5 and its derivatives contribute 
to a 50-fold greater permissiveness for HCV replication (11, 12). 
In 2005, the cloning of Japanese fulminant hepatitis (JFH-1) — 
an HCV genotype 2a isolate with exceptional efficiency at viral 
genome replication that does not require adaptive mutations 
(13–15) — combined with expression in Huh-7.5–derived cells, for 
the first time allowed the production of workable titers of infec￾tious virus in culture, overcoming a major obstacle that had hith￾erto hindered the development of antiviral agents (9).
Innate recognition of HCV in hepatocytes occurs through dsRNA 
sensor protein kinase R (PKR), RIG-I, and TLR-3 (Figure 1A). 
PKR binds to the HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) as early 
as 2 hours after infection and prior to the interaction with RIG-I; 
both pathways result in the recruitment of mitochondrial antiviral 
signaling (MAVS, also known as CARDIF/IPS-1/VISA) and tumor 
necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3 (TRAF3) (16). PKR 
preferentially induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) including the 
ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 that negatively regulates RIG-I ubiq￾uitylation. ISG15 induction inhibits the ability of RIG-I to recruit 
MAVS and TRAF3, and thereby may lead to a net proviral effect (16, 
17). The latter is supported by recent data indicating that pharma￾cological PKR inhibition decreases HCV replication and increases 
IFN induction (18). RIG-I binds the polyuridine motif of the HCV 
genome 3′ nontranslated region, i.e., HCV pathogen–associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the recruitment of a sig￾naling complex that activates transcription factors and the pro￾duction of type I and III IFNs as well as proinflammatory cytokines 
(refs. 19, 20, and Figure 1A). The signals driving this response are 
relayed through MAVS localized within both mitochondria and 
peroxisomes (21). The ER contains a specialized domain, the 
mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM), which physically 
links the ER to mitochondria and has been implicated in NLRP3 
inflammasome signaling (21). Once sufficient viral proteins have 
accumulated in the cytosol, HCV uses its multifunctional NS3/4A 
protease, essential for HCV replication, to target the MAM-an￾chored synapse, cleaving MAVS from the MAM (but not from 
the mitochondria) and ablating RIG-I–mediated innate immune 
signaling (21). Another independent signaling pathway involves 
the binding of activated TLR-3 to the adaptor TRIF (Toll/inter￾leukin-1 receptor domain–containing adapter–inducing IFN-β), 
which can also be cleaved by NS3/4A (19). Thus, the NS3 serine 
protease inhibitors that are part of the current triple-therapy reg￾imen inhibit replication but would also be expected to restore 
innate responses within hepatocytes. Signaling from either MAVS

Since the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) by molecular cloning almost a quarter of a century ago, unprece￾dented at the time because the virus had never been grown in cell culture or detected serologically, there have been 
impressive strides in many facets of our understanding of the natural history of the disease, the viral life cycle, the 
pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy. It is apparent that the virus has developed multiple strategies to evade immune 
surveillance and eradication. This Review covers what we currently understand of the temporal and spatial immu￾nological changes within the human innate and adaptive host immune responses that ultimately determine the 
outcomes of HCV infection.

or TRIF leads to the activation of various transcription factors, 
which in turn induce the production of type I and type III IFNs 
(via IFN regulatory factors [IRFs]), as well as proinflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines (via NF-κB and AP-1).
Type III IFNs, which consist of four IFN-λs, are antiviral 
cytokines that display type I IFN-like (IFN-α/β–like) antiviral 
activity (22, 23), but are structurally and genetically closer to the 
members of IL-10 family of cytokines. Type III IFNs signal through 
a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-28Rα (also known 
as IFN-λR1) and the IL-10 receptor β chain (IL-10Rβ) (ref. 24 
and Figure 1). In contrast to the nearly ubiquitous expression of 
the IFN-α receptor (IFN-αR), IL-28Rα has been found primarily 
on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) (24). Following both 
in vitro and in vivo HCV infection, type III IFNs are upregulated at 
Figure 1
Hepatocyte innate immune responses. (A) LDL receptors (LDLRs) on the basolateral hepatocyte surface, SR-BI, CD81, and tight-junction proteins 
CLDN-1 (claudin-1) and OCLN (occludin) are essential for HCV uptake (9). Intracellular HCV recognition occurs through dsRNA sensors such as 
RIG-I and TLR-3. MAMs function as the central scaffold that coordinates MAVS-dependent signaling of the RIG-I pathway between mitochondria 
and peroxisomes (21). MAVS interacts with the essential adapter protein TRAF3 to further recruit downstream kinases; activation of the kinases 
IKK-ε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphorylate the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 (19), and binding to NF-κB lead to the 
induction of antiviral and immunomodulatory genes, including types I and III IFNs, as well as chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines that 
function in parallel with IFNs to mediate the response to HCV (147). (B) Binding of type I IFNs to the IFN-α/β receptors (IFN-αR1 and -2) and type 
III IFNs (IFN-λ) to the heterodimeric IL-28Ra/IL-10Rβ receptor (24) results in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, conferring stable association 
with IRF-9. The resulting IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription factor complex localizes to the hepatocyte nucleus, where it binds to 
the ISREs within the promoter/enhancer region of hundreds of ISGs (147). Autocrine and paracrine signaling in neighboring cells results in anti￾HCV amplification loops (including IRF-7, which binds to IFN promoters). HCV core protein subverts immunity by the induction of suppressors of 
cytokine signaling (SOCS1/SOCS3) and by impairing the binding of ISGF3 to nuclear IFN ISREs (19). See text for details.

the mRNA and protein levels to an even greater extent than type I 
IFNs (25, 26). IFNs activate the JAK/STAT pathway, culminating in 
the induction of hundreds of ISGs encoding effector proteins that 
include ISG56, IFITM1, viperin, and 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthase 
(OAS1), which restrict HCV infection within hepatocytes (27, 28), 
as well as PKR and IRF-7. Moreover, the promoters of early ISGs 
can be stimulated directly by IRF-3 (16). The relative requirement 
for IRF-3, IRF-7, or both vary according to cell and IFN type (29). 
Notably, type III IFNs, in addition to inducing well-known ISGs, 
activate a distinct set of genes in primary human hepatocytes from 
the type I IFNs (including those involved in chemotaxis and anti￾gen presentation) with different kinetics of induction, suggesting 
divergent signaling pathways following receptor engagement (25).
Multiple proteins expressed by HCV have evolved important 
interactions with host cell proteins that benefit the viral cycle 
either directly or indirectly by disarming antiviral responses 
(reviewed in refs. 10, 30, 31). In addition to actions of the NS3/4A 
protease described above, for example, HCV core protein inter￾feres with STAT signaling (via the induction of SOCS1/3) and 
may contribute to IFN resistance by diminished binding of ISGF3 
to nuclear IFN–stimulated response elements (ISREs) (Figure 1B 
and ref. 19). An additional negative feedback loop is exemplified 
by USP18, a protease that decreases ISGylation of cellular pro￾teins, thereby attenuating tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 
and the expression of ISGs, decreasing the antiviral activity of 
IFNs (32). Paradoxically, higher hepatic ISG expression is predic￾tive of a nonresponse to IFN-α treatment (33, 34), and a number 
of mechanisms have been proposed. The induction of type IIIs as 
the predominant antiviral pathway and driver of ISG induction 
(25, 29) may render hepatocytes refractory to further type I IFN 
action, conceptually supported by the observation that blocking 
type III IFN enhances the antiviral activity of exogenous IFN-α
(ref. 25 and Figure 1B).
Association of genetic variation in IFN-λ genes 
and HCV recovery
One of the most ground-breaking discoveries in the area of HCV 
host response within the past five years has been that SNPs in 
chromosome 19 within or near the IFNL3 gene (encoding IFN-λ3, 
also known as IL-28B) are highly predictive of both antiviral suc￾cess and spontaneous recovery in untreated patients (35, 36). As 
described above, in humans, four genes encode the members of 
the type III IFN family, i.e., IFN-λ1 (IFNL1, also known as IL29), 
IFN-λ2 (IFNL2 or IL28A), IFN-λ3 (IFNL3), and IFN-λ4 (IFNL4). 
Among these, IFN-λ3 is the most potent in inhibiting JFH-1 rep￾lication (25, 37). A genome-wide association study that examined 
the frequencies of about 600,000 SNPs demonstrated that patients 
homozygous for the C allele at the rs12979860 SNP of IFNL3 had 
a 2-fold greater chance of cure with pegylated IFN and ribavirin 
compared with those with the TT genotype (35). The advanta￾geous allele is more frequently found in mixed–European descent 
and Asian populations relative to African-Americans, and much 
of the race-related impairment in response to antiviral therapy 
is explained by population differences in the incidence of IFNL3
genotypes. Subsequent reports have confirmed that the IFNL3
genotype is the most important baseline predictor of sustained 
virologic response (SVR) after treatment with pegylated IFN plus 
ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 infection (38). The effect of 
the IFNL3 genotype is evident within the first 48 hours following 
treatment initiation, indicating that IFN-λ3 somehow primes the 
host response to HCV, decreasing the threshold for virologic con￾trol with treatment (24). The favorable IFNL3 variant is associated 
with lower ISG expression in pretreatment liver biopsies (39), and 
exogenous IFN-α induces a rapid antiviral state (40). Interestingly, 
serum levels of IFN-γ–induced protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10), a 
well-characterized marker of HCV (41) that may antagonize T cell 
recruitment in chronic infection (42), enhance the predictive value 
of the IFNL3 genotype in patients receiving dual therapy (43). In 
addition, the dinucleotide ss469415590 variant of IFNL4 (44), a 
newly identified gene upstream of IFNL3, provides an even greater 
prediction of impaired viral kinetics among African-Americans 
than rs12979860 variants of IFNL3 (44). Recent data suggest that 
while IFN-λ4 induces weak expression of ISGs that could provide 
an antiviral response to lower HCV load, it uniquely induces genes 
involved in HCV-related liver injury (e.g., chemokine CCL5 and the 
proto-oncogene FOS) and also reduces the responsiveness to type I 
and type III IFNs that are required for efficient HCV clearance (44).
The multicellular immune response to HCV
DCs. The orchestration of diverse, multifunctional cell types fol￾lowing HCV infection (Figure 2) ultimately governs the outcome 
of infection, and these cell types represent potential targets for 
pharmacologic and immunotherapeutic approaches (31). DCs 
play crucial roles in innate pathogen sensing as well as in the initia￾tion of adaptive immunity (45). Several major subsets of DCs have 
been identified, including plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid 
DCs (mDCs). pDCs are the main producer of type I IFNs, synthe￾sizing up to 109 IFN molecules per cell within 12 hours after acti￾vation (46). IFN production by pDCs requires cell-to-cell contact 
and is proportional to the number of HCV-infected hepatocytes; 
further, IFN production is mediated by TLR7 activation indepen￾dently of HCV RNA replication within pDCs (47). Recently, HCV 
RNA–containing exosomes produced by infected hepatocytes 
have been shown to transfer their RNA to pDCs that subsequently 
respond by secreting IFN-α (48); moreover, HCV subgenomic rep￾licon cells that replicate viral RNA without producing infectious 
virus particles can also trigger type I IFNs. Recent work from our 
group (49) has demonstrated that intracellular sensing of the HCV 
PAMP by pDCs leads to robust types I and III IFN production and 
is mediated by signaling through RIG-I, challenging the dogma 
that TLR, and not RLR, signaling within pDC predominates (50). 
Furthermore, conditioned medium from HCV PAMP–transfected 
human pDCs greatly inhibits HCV replication and induces STAT1 
and IRF9 within Huh 7.5.1 cells. Although these collective data 
implicate sentinel roles for pDCs in HCV sensing, further work is 
necessary to understand the characteristics of pDCs that favor acti￾vation, which occurs in only a small subset, and the mechanisms 
that lead to their depletion or functional impairment in chronic 
infection, as described in some but not all studies (48, 51–54). 
In this regard, the ligation of C-type lectin immunoreceptors, 
blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA2), and DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) 
on pDCs by HCV E2 glycoprotein antagonizes the production 
of IFNs (55), and the relative expression of these receptors likely 
affects the ability of pDCs to respond to HCV within the hepatic 
microenvironment. Another C-type lectin, CLEC9A, is expressed 
by a distinct population of DCs, blood DC antigen 3 (BDCA3)+, 
which are enriched in the liver and produce significantly higher 
levels of type III (but relatively lower levels of type I) IFN compared 
with other DC populations following coculture with HCV (56). 
The latter study found that the IFNL3 allele associated with a more

Immune response to HCV infection within the liver. Viral RNA is transferred to pDCs, triggering robust production of IFNs that inhibit HCV replica￾tion in hepatocytes. pDCs produce more type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) IFNs, whereas BDCA3+ DCs produce more type III IFNs with HCV infection and 
do not require direct cell-to-cell contact. NK and NKT cells comprise a large proportion of intrahepatic lymphocytes, mediating antiviral functions 
through a combination of IFN type II (IFN-γ) production and cytolytic function. IFNα-induced TRAIL is associated with the control of HCV (78, 82). 
Hepatic accumulation of NKp46hi NK cells is associated with lower viral replication and attenuated fibrosis (78). KCs phagocytose HCV, leading 
to the induction of innate immune (IFN-β) as well as inflammatory (IL-1β) responses. HCV core protein inhibits type I IFN responses (89) and also 
drives proinflammatory responses, augmenting processes that result in liver fibrosis (87). IFN-γ induces KC upregulation of Gal-9 and PD-L1, 
inhibitory ligands that promote T cell dysfunction. LSECs can pinocytose viral particles and produce a broad array of IFNs. Multispecific and 
polyfunctional CD4+ T (Th) cells provide “help” for clonal expansion of B cells and CTLs required for spontaneous viral control. Early expression 
of CD127, IL-2 production, development of neutralizing Abs, and HCV-specific CTL cells contribute to immune response (148, 149). PD-1 and 
TIM3 demarcate functionally impaired CTLs. Moreover, CD33+ myeloid–derived suppressor cells (150) and FOXP3+ Tregs (10, 151) attenuate T 
cell responses and immune-mediated liver injury.

favorable response also correlates with greater type III IFN pro￾duction than the less favorable IFNL3 genotypes, shedding some 
light on the puzzling lack of association between IFNL3 SNPs and 
hepatic expression of IFN-λs (57). Although hepatocytes com￾prise most of the mRNA message from liver biopsies, recent data 
suggest that there may be cell-specific effects on expression, and 
BDCA3+ DCs and pDCs are potent sources of IFN-λs (56). This 
concept is further supported by the recent demonstration that 
donor and recipient IFNL3 polymorphisms differentially affect 
HCV outcomes following liver transplantation (58).
NK cell phenotype and function associated with HCV infection outcomes. 
NK cells constitute an early host defense against viral pathogens 
(59–61), eliminating virus-infected cells both directly via cytolytic 
mechanisms and indirectly by secreting cytokines such as IFN-γ
(62, 63). Although NK cells have been classically viewed as innate 
immune cells, their effects can extend into periods of adaptive 
immunity, and hepatic NK cells demonstrate adaptive immu￾nity to structurally diverse antigens (64, 65). NK cell activity is 
stringently controlled by activating and inhibitory NK receptors 
(NKRs). NKRs include the predominantly inhibitory killer Ig–like 
receptors (KIRs), C-type lectin-like receptors of the NKG2 fam￾ily comprising inhibitory (NKG2A) and activatory (NKG2C/D) 
isoforms, as well as the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) such 
as NKp30 (also known as NCR3), NKp44 (also known as NCR2), 
and NKp46 (also known as NCR1) that deliver activating signals 
(66–68). Emerging data indicate that NK cells play central roles in 
every stage of HCV infection, from the protection against infection 
in injection drug users (IDUs) to the prediction of antiviral success 
or failure with IFN-based therapies.
By convention, CD56+ NK cells have been assigned to func￾tional categories on the basis of the relative cell surface density of 
CD56; namely, CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, predominant in periph￾eral blood, display potent cytolytic activity, whereas the poorly 
cytolytic CD56bright NK cells enriched in tissue are responsible 
for cytokine production, although recent data call into question 
this simple classification (69). IDUs repeatedly exposed to HCV 
infection but who remain uninfected have proportionally higher 
circulating frequencies of CD56dim mature effector NK cells (70). 
The balance between positive and negative signals from activating 
and inhibitory cell surface receptors is likely to result in NK cell 
functional changes (71). In our IDU cohort, there was a correlation 
between the frequency of NK cells expressing the activating recep￾tor NKp30 and in vitro lymphokine-activated killing. NKp30, 
which is induced by IL-2, is most highly expressed on the NK and 
NKT cells of exposed, uninfected subjects (70). The NKp46 recep￾tor is considered the major human natural cytotoxicity receptor 
involved in NK cell–mediated killing (72, 73) and is more highly 
expressed on the NK cells of women and people of mixed Euro￾pean descent (i.e., populations known to demonstrate higher rates 
of spontaneous resolution of HCV infection) (74–76). NKp46 
ligand expression is induced on hepatocytes following HCV infec￾tion (76), although whether this represents a specific HCV compo￾nent or an unspecific stress response is not yet clear. TLR stimula￾tion of purified NKp46hi is associated with increased transcription 
of cytotoxicity-related genes as compared with NKp46lo counter￾parts. Two recent studies (76, 77) with further discussion in an 
editorial (78) highlight that NKp46hi NK cells (or ligation with 
an agonist NKp46 antibody) have increased anti-HCV activity in 
vitro, a process mediated by IFN-γ; accordingly, intrahepatic accu￾mulation of NKp46hi NK cells is inversely correlated with HCV 
RNA levels (77). An inverse correlation also exists with the stage 
of fibrosis and ex vivo intrahepatic NKp46hi frequencies; in vitro, 
blockade of NKp46 reduces NK cell–mediated killing of human 
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), implicating potentially important 
antifibrotic roles (77) for this population of NK cells (Figure 2).
NK cells are rapidly activated by cytokine stimulation, and thus, 
studies have examined whether the response to anti-HCV therapy 
(the major component of which is IFN-α) would be predicted by 
the phenotype and function of NK cells. Pretreatment expansion 
of CD56– NK cells functionally skewed toward MIP-1β production 
(rather than IFN-γ) is a predictor of failure to pegylated IFN-α and 
ribavirin (79). Patients with impaired viral kinetics following initi￾ation of antiviral therapy have NK cells with higher expression lev￾els of inhibitory receptors (80), and a multivariate model based on 
two inhibitory receptors (NKG2A and CD158e) is highly predictive 
of SVR. Pegylated IFN-α transcriptionally upregulates ISGs and 
TNF-related apoptosis–inducing ligand (TRAIL) in NK cells. HCV 
also enhances the susceptibility of primary human hepatocytes 
to TRAIL-mediated killing via increased expression of the death 
receptors DR4 and DR5 (81). The ex vivo expression of TRAIL and 
CD107a on NK cells increases as early as hours following the ini￾tiation of antiviral therapy (82, 83), correlates with the induction 
of phosphorylated STAT1 levels (84), and is associated with early 
virologic response. Thus, on aggregate, these data identify NK cell 
markers associated with protection from early infection and pre￾dictors of response to IFN-based therapy. Moreover, NK cells can 
demonstrate regulatory and reciprocal interactions with B and T 
cells, DCs, macrophages, and endothelial cells (ECs), thus func￾tioning to amplify or attenuate immune responses (60).
Liver-resident macrophages and ECs. Kupffer cells (KCs) constitute 
the first macrophage population with which pathogens, bacterial 
endotoxins, and microbial debris derived from the gastrointestinal 
tract come into contact, and together with the liver sinusoidal ECs 
(LSECs), make up the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (ref. 85 
and Figure 2). ISG upregulation within KCs is a strong positive 
and independent predictor of subsequent response to antiviral 
therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin, whereas hepatocyte ISG 
expression was associated with nonresponse (86), underscoring the 
importance of examining different patterns of cellular activation. 
HCV enters KCs (but not undifferentiated monocytes) via a phago￾cytic uptake that is independent of productive infection, leading 
to the induction of IFN-β–dependent innate immune responses 
through RIG-I/MAVS, as well as inflammatory IL-1β–dependent 
signaling through TLR7/MyD88-dependent and NLRP3 inflam￾masome pathways (87). The induction of proinflammatory genes 
may lead to the recruitment of immune cells to the liver and aug￾ment the processes that result in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Tolerance is a critical mechanism that protects against excessive 
inflammation. However, monocytes/macrophages from patients 
with chronic HCV are activated and lack tolerance to proinflam￾matory cytokine–inducing TLR ligands (88). Moreover, the com￾bination of HCV core protein, IFN-γ, and LPS during macrophage 
differentiation recapitulates the ex vivo findings in chronic HCV 
patients (88). Recombinant HCV core protein, which engages 
TLR-2, induces primary human KCs to secrete IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
IL-10 and inhibits TLR-3–mediated type I IFN responses (89). 
The HCV core further subverts host immunity by attenuating 
KC expression of TRAIL, a transcriptional target of IRF-3 (90) 
and strongly upregulates the expression of programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is known to promote T cell dysfunction

and the development of viral persistence (89, 91, 92). These effects 
are largely mediated through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), 
indicating shared regulation between MyD88- and TRIF-depen￾dent TLR signaling pathways (89). Galectin-9 (Gal-9), another 
important inhibitory ligand (93), is expressed robustly by KCs and 
circulates at high levels in HCV-infected patients (94). Gal-9 binds 
to T cell Ig and mucin domain–containing molecule 3 (TIM3), 
inducing apoptosis of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells and expanding 
Tregs (94). Further, KC-derived Gal-9 mediates T cell dysfunction 
and predicts poor prognosis in patients with hepatitis B–related 
hepatocellular carcinoma (95). Gal-9 has pleiotropic roles that 
include the inhibition and regulation of NK cell functions that 
may impact viral persistence (96).
LSECs function to clear waste molecules that have entered the 
circulation (97) and comprise approximately 50% of nonparenchy￾mal cells in the liver. Although long recognized as central to the 
induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (CTL) tolerance and apoptosis 
(98, 99), an understanding of the roles in antiviral responses of 
LSECs, which express a wide array of PRRs (100), is just begin￾ning to emerge. Their strategic anatomic position (Figure 2) places 
LSECs as the first cells in contact with blood flow in the sinus￾oids (101). Expression of the C-type lectin L-SIGN by LSECs was 
postulated to mediate capture of HCV particles and transcytosis 
of the virus across the endothelial barrier, thereby concentrat￾ing infectious particles and facilitating their direct contact with 
hepatocytes (102). Moreover, LSECs are highly efficient scavengers 
that pinocytose particles less than 0.2 μm in size, which typically 
encompasses virus-sized particles (103). The recent demonstration 
that LSECs, rather than KCs, clear the bulk of blood-borne human 
adenovirus underscores their importance during the viremic phase 
of any natural viral infection (103). Even if LSECs do not sus￾tain active replication, viral sensing and its downstream effector 
responses, including exosomal transfer of ISG products (ref. 104 
and Figure 2), may impact other processes within the hepatic 
microenvironment and warrant further investigation.
B cells and humoral immunity. Whether the humoral response plays 
an important role in controlling HCV infection remains contro￾versial (105, 106); indeed, the fact that hypogammaglobulinemic 
humans can spontaneously eradicate HCV (107) may suggest 
that antibody responses are dispensable. Studies showing a lack 
of association between neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and viral 
clearance were confounded by poorly defined viral inoculum and 
heterogeneous patient populations. However, in a study of healthy 
young women infected with identical, single-source viral inocu￾lum, spontaneous resolvers demonstrated an early induction of 
NAb responses directed against HCV envelope glycoproteins, 
including broader cross-neutralization of heterologous strains, 
whereas chronically evolving subjects had delayed and low-titered 
NAb responses (108). The use of retroviral pseudoparticles bearing 
autologous HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) from the initial inocu￾lum allowed the precise examination of strain-specific neutraliza￾tion. The late phase of chronic infection is accompanied by the 
induction of NAb responses as well as an increasing rate of enve￾lope viral sequence evolution (106), indicative of ongoing humoral 
selection pressure. Viral escape may occur through several addi￾tional mechanisms (108), including an impaired cross-neutral￾izing activity that selects the outgrowth of viral variants and the 
interplay of HCV glycoproteins with HDL and the scavenger recep￾tor SR-BI (Figure 1A), which can prevent the effect of NAbs and 
enhance cell entry of HCV and infection (109). Only a minority 
of patients with resolved HCV infection exhibit NAbs 10–17 years 
after viral clearance (108), which may underlie the absent or lim￾ited protective immunity against reinfection (110). Moreover, 
human liver chimeric mice infused with HCV E2–specific human 
monoclonal antibodies directed against a conserved epitope are 
protected against heterologous HCV (111), raising the possibility 
Figure 3
Interplay of host T cell responses and the evolution of HCV epitopes. 
(A) A sustained CD4+ T cell response with multispecific CTLs may 
constrain the development of viral escape mutations, leading to viral 
clearance during acute infection. (B) If CTL responses are weak (man￾ifested by high PD-1 and TIM3 expression) with impaired CD4 help and 
priming, escape mutations likely will not develop. High viral levels and 
intact HCV epitopes are associated with increased levels of inhibitory 
receptors. (C) Failure of the CD4+ T cell response in the presence of a 
narrow but vigorous CTL response favors the development of escape 
mutations. Additional compensatory mutations may be required for 
replicative fitness (120–122). Viral amino acid substitution is associ￾ated with decreased inhibitory receptor expression on CTLs, perhaps 
accounting for their robust proliferation to wild-type, nonmutated virus 
(115). (D) Without a restricting HLA allele and immune selective pres￾sure, reversion to the wild-type sequence likely occurs because of the 
high fitness cost associated with an escape mutation. (Adapted with

that future approaches using a combination of such NAbs and 
blocking receptors involved in viral entry (112) might demonstrate 
efficacy in high-risk populations (e.g., to prevent allograft reinfec￾tion in patients who have undergone liver transplantation or in 
healthcare workers with needle-stick injuries).
CTLs in HCV infection. CTLs are the primary effector cells that 
mediate viral clearance through the secretion of antiviral cytokines, 
which is about 100- to 1,000-fold more effective than cytolytic activ￾ity (10) (113). In the absence of viral clearance, the display of HCV 
peptides persists on the surface of hepatocytes, and the continued 
presence of CTLs results in significant immune-mediated liver 
injury (31). Further, the secretion of inflammatory and profibrotic 
cytokines such as TGF-β activates stellate cells, the primary source 
of fibrosis, ultimately leading to progressive liver damage. Chim￾panzee and human studies were highly instructive in understanding 
the distinguishing features of CTL responses that provide perma￾nent viral control versus viral persistence (10, 114–118), includ￾ing the recognition that CD4+ T cells are critical both for limiting 
immune evasion and priming effector memory CTLs (119, 120). 
A complex interplay between the opposing forces of immune 
selection pressure and viral fitness costs drives mutations in HCV 
(Figure 3). The high rate of replication coupled with the lack of 
proofreading ability of its polymerase provides the HCV genome 
with a means to escape HLA-restricted immune responses (10, 121). 
The ability of HCV to mutate at an amino acid residue is con￾strained, however, by fitness costs, and compensatory mutations 
may be required to restore HCV replicative capacity (121–123).
Anergy occurs when T cells are initially primed improperly by sig￾naling through the TCR in the absence of costimulatory or inflam￾matory signals (124, 125), which results in a failure to develop 
proper function from the outset. In contrast, exhausted T cells are 
primed by antigen, costimulation, and inflammation. Although 
these T cells initially develop effector functions, prolonged, exces￾sive stimulation leads to the progressive loss of function over time 
(124). Compelling evidence exists for both anergy and exhaustion 
in chronic HCV infection. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
is an immunoreceptor tyrosine–based inhibition motif–contain￾ing (ITIM-containing) receptor expressed on activated T cells that 
mediates hyporesponsiveness. PD-1 is upregulated in chronic 
infection within the intrahepatic compartment (91, 126) and its 
ligand PD-L1 is expressed by a number of nonparenchymal cells 
in the liver including KCs, LSECs, and DCs, as well as IFN-exposed 
hepatocytes (10). Moreover, PD-1 expression on HCV-specific CTLs 
inversely correlates with early and sustained virologic response to 
combination IFN-based antiviral therapy (127) and is associated 
with impaired control of replication in vitro (128). In association 
with PD-1, the coexpression of multiple inhibitory receptors, 
including 2B4, CD160, KLRG1, and TIM3, identifies HCV-spe￾cific CTLs with impaired proliferation and cytokine production 
and correlates with the absence of sequence variation within cog￾nate epitopes, consistent with the necessity for ongoing antigen 
triggering (129, 130). In this regard (131), the frequency of dual 
TIM3posPD-1pos HCV–specific CTLs is predictive of viral persistence 
in patients with acute HCV infection and is increased within the 
central memory subset (compared with the effector memory popu￾lation) and within the hepatic compartment relative to the periph￾eral compartment. Increased levels of TIM3 and PD-1 expression 
are associated with CTL dysfunction, with TIM3hi/PD-1hi CTLs pro￾ducing less IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CD107a than their TIM3lo/PD-1lo
counterparts. Importantly, blockade of different coinhibitory path￾ways may differentially enhance CTL effector functions. CTL avid￾ity, also termed “functional avidity” (132, 133), refers to the overall 
sensitivity of the T cell response to antigen density. High-avidity 
CTLs are those that secrete substantial amounts of IFN-γ when 
stimulated with relevant APCs loaded with low concentrations of 
peptide. Considerable data in other model systems demonstrate the 
immense potential of high-avidity CTLs to preferentially control 
certain viral infections as well as tumors (134). In infections that 
can rapidly evolve escape mutations, such as with HCV, another 
potentially important attribute of CTLs is the ability to cross-recog￾nize mutated epitopes (135–137). From a standpoint of the design 
of novel immunotherapeutic approaches, the use of TCRs derived 
from CTLs demonstrating relatively higher avidity and cross-reac￾tivity would seem optimal (Figure 4). HCV TCR transduction of 
human T cells renders them responsive to HCV peptide–loaded 
hepatocytes (138) and inhibits viral replication in vitro (139).
Future directions
The past five years have seen a remarkable degree of progress in the 
understanding of HCV pathogenesis, and we are in the midst of 
an extraordinary phase of development with direct-acting antiviral 
agents that may cure the majority of patients undergoing antivi￾Figure 4
Paradigm for avidity and cross-reactivity pertaining to HCV-specific 
CTLs, their antiviral efficacy and probability of mutational escape. 
(i) CTLs with low functional avidity rarely select for escape variants, 
particularly with broad cross-recognition of mutant virus. HCV-specific 
CTLs that respond effectively to low concentrations of peptide have 
greater potency than those requiring high peptide concentrations. (ii) 
CTL responses rapidly selecting for HCV escape variants require a low 
concentration of peptide for stimulation (high avidity), (iii) but if coupled 
with poor cross-recognition, they are associated with decreased anti￾viral efficacy and potentially impaired recognition of variant peptides 
as they emerge (note that there is the least amount of supportive data 
in this poor cross-recognition paradigm). (iv) CTLs with low functional 
avidity rarely select for escape variants. The most effective CTL spec￾ificities express both functional attributes (in light purple) during the 
earliest stages of infection and predate the resolution of viremia. Taken 
together, the data suggest that strong immunity will eradicate HCV 
infection, weak immunity will drive few mutations, and intermediate 
immunity will select for escape but allow for persistence, resulting in a 
broader viral quasispecies.

ral therapy. However, as antiviral therapy will not be accessible for 
most patients in resource-limited regions, the development of a 
safe and effective HCV vaccine is paramount. HCV poses multi￾ple important obstacles to vaccine development (140), including 
a considerable primary sequence divergence that is greater than 
HIV (141). In vaccinated animals, despite initial control, viral 
persistence is associated with T cell immune escape (142), higher 
viral mutation rates (143, 144), and expression of inhibitory recep￾tors, which suggest that in the absence of rapid viral clearance, an 
environment for selective pressure or T cell exhaustion remains. 
Longitudinal liver biopsies revealed correlations between higher 
PD-1 expression and failure to control viremia, pointing to the 
possibility that strong induction and activation of CTLs may be 
counterproductive if they target promiscuous HCV epitopes that 
do not impact viral fitness (145). HCV is able to suppress the early 
innate immune response both within hepatocytes and innate 
lymphocytes, such as NK cells, and can attenuate or escape T cell 
responses. The nature and extent of immune restoration that 
occurs with regimens not including IFN-α, which is known to have 
antiproliferative effects (146), remain to be defined. Greater under￾standing of the complex crosstalk between different cell types 
within the hepatic microenvironment may soon allow the identi￾fication of targeted approaches to address the sequelae of chronic 
infection, including fibrosis and the development of cancer.
