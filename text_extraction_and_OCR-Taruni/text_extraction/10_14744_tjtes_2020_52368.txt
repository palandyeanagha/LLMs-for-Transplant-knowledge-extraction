ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare liver transplant and non-liver transplant patients who underwent appendectomy with 
a presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
METHODS: Demographic and clinicopathological features of 13 liver transplant recipients (transplant group) who underwent post￾transplant appendectomy with a presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis were compared with the features of 52 non-liver transplant 
patients (non-transplant group). They underwent appendectomy with a presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the same time 
period. The transplant group was matched at random in a 1: 4 ratio with the non- transplant group. While the continuous variables 
were compared using the Mann Whitney-U test, categorical variables were compared with Fisher’s exact test. A p-value of less than 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients aged between one year and 84 years were included in this study. While the age of the 52 patients 
(32 male and 20 female) in the non- transplant group ranged from 17 years to 84 years, the age of the 13 patients (nine male and four 
female) in the transplant group ranged from one year to 64 years. Statistically significant differences were noted between both groups 
concerning WBC (p=0.002), neutrophil (p=0.002), lymphocyte (p=0.032), platelets (p=0.032), RDW (p=0.001), CRP (p=0.009), PNR 
(p=0.042), WNR (p=0.03), and appendiceal length (p<0.001). The negative appendectomy rate was relatively higher in transplant than 
the non-transplant group but this difference was not statistically significant (30.8% vs. 21.2%; p=0.477). Perforated acute appendicitis 
occurred more frequently in the transplant group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (30.8% vs. 9.6%; p=0.070).
CONCLUSION: WBC and neutrophil were lower in the LT group; however, the CRP and RDW were higher in the LT group. Fur￾ther, perforation and negative appendectomy rates were higher in the LT group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

respectively.[1] Parameters, such as leukocyte count, neutro￾phil count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, some interleukins 
(IL), procalcitonin level, and the findings of physical examina￾tion, used in the diagnosis of AAp depend on the extent of 
the host response to the inflammation in the body. Despite 
the contradicting findings in the literature, there is a general 
consensus that AAp signs and symptoms in an immunocom￾promised individual may differ from AAp signs and symptoms 
in an immunocompetent patient.[6–8] Thus, it has been sug-

INTRODUCTION
Acute appendicitis (AAp) is one of the most common causes 
of admission to emergency units, and appendectomy is one 
of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the 
world.[1] The lifetime risk of an AAp episode is 8.6% in male 
and 6.7% in female patients.[1–5] Epidemiologic studies state 
that the risk of undergoing an appendectomy at any point 
in their lives in male and female patients is 12% and 23%,

Sarıcı et al. Liver transplant versus non-liver transplant patients underwent appendectomy with presumed diagnosis of AAp
gested that transplant patients may have a higher rate of late 
diagnosis and risk of fatal complications, such as perforation 
and abscess formation, due to immunosuppressive therapy 
received in the postoperative period.[7] The present study 
aims to compare the demographic and clinicopathologic data 
of the immunosuppressed liver transplant (LT) recipients who 
underwent an appendectomy due to AAp to that of their 
non-transplant counterparts who underwent appendectomy 
during the same period. This study will provide an indirect 
means of investigation of the effects of immunosuppressive 
therapy on the signs and symptoms of inflammation in AAp. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between March 2002 and October 2019, a total of 2442 pa￾tients underwent LT in Inonu University Liver Transplant Insti￾tute, and 13 (0.53%) of these patients underwent appendecto￾my with a presumed diagnosis of AAp after LT. This group was 
defined as the LT group (n=13). A control group was created 
for comparison with the transplant group, and this group was 
defined as the non-LT group (n=52). The non-LT group com￾prised patients who presented to our emergency unit with 
abdominal pain in the same time period and underwent ap￾pendectomy with the presumed diagnosis of AAp. Patients 
with a history of corticosteroid, chemotherapeutic agent, or 
other immunosuppressive drug use for any reason were not 
included in the non-LT group. The LT group was matched at 
random in a 1:4 ratio with the non-transplant group (G*Pow￾er 3.1.9.2 software; effect size=0.7, two-tailed, power: 81.8%, 
Df:63, critical t=1.349, non-centrality parameter=2.257). To 
minimize the bias risk, the non-LT group (control group) was 
enrolled by a surgeon who was not related to this study. Both 
groups were compared concerning age (years), sex (male, fe￾male), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lym￾phocyte count, platelets, red cell distribution width (RDW), 
platelet distribution width (PDW), mean corpuscular hemo￾globin (MCH), mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), bilirubin level, CRP level, white cell neutrophil 
ratio (WNR), white cell lymphocyte ratio (WLR), neutrophil 
to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), 
platelet to the neutrophil ratio (PNR), appendix diameter 
(mm), appendix length (mm), presence of acute appendicitis, 
ultrasonographic findings, and histopathological findings. 
Immunosuppression for LT Recipients
Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered immedi￾ately after the completion of the hepatic artery anastomosis 
during liver graft implantation. Thereafter, peroral steroid 
treatment was initiated on a postoperative day one and ta￾pered from 100 mg/day to 0.25 mg/kg/day and stopped 3-6 
months after surgery, except in patients with autoimmune 
diseases. Cyclosporine was only prescribed in pediatric pa￾tients who underwent LT due to acute liver failure or neuro￾logical Wilson’s disease. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolim￾us were usually initiated on postoperative day 3. Tacrolimus 
was the first choice for immunosuppressive therapy in most 
cases except in patients with renal dysfunction or hepatore￾nal syndrome. In patients with impaired or deteriorated renal 
function, tacrolimus was stopped or tapered and everolimus 
was added until renal function improved. 
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Sta￾tistics v25.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Inc, 
Chicago, IL, USA). The quantitative variables were expressed 
as, median and min-max. The qualitative variables were re￾ported as number and percentage (%). Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test was used to determine whether the quantitative vari￾ables showed normal distribution. Mann Whitney-U test was 
used to compare the quantitative variables. Fisher’s exact 
tests were used to compare qualitative variables because the 
minimum expected count was less than 5 for all compared 
parameters. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered sta￾tistically significant. Patient medical records were retrospec￾tively reviewed after obtaining approval from Inonu Univer￾sity institutional review board for non-interventional studies 
(Approval No: 2019/16-381).
RESULTS
A total of 65 patients (41 male and 24 female) aged between 
one year and 84 years were included in this case-control study. 
While the age of the 52 patients (32 male and 20 female) in 
the non- transplant group ranged from 17 years to 84 years, 
the age of the 13 patients (nine male and four female) in the 
LT group ranged from one year to 64 years. Patients in the LT 
group underwent appendectomy with a preliminary diagnosis 
of AAp a median 339 days (min-max: 20–2023 days) after LT. 
While living donor LT was performed in 10 patients in the LT 
group, deceased donor LT was performed in the remaining 
three patients. Eleven of the patients in the LT group were 
adults, and the remaining two were in the pediatric age group 
(one and eight years).
There was no statistically significant difference between 
the groups concerning age (p=0.163), sex (p=0.753), PDW 
(p=0.700), MCH (p=0.115), MPV (p=0.611), MCV (p=0.081), 
TBil (p=0.528), NLR (p=0.228), PLR (p=0.682), WLR 
(p=0.412), diameter of appendix (p=0.717), presence of acute 
appendicitis according to histopathological findings (p=0.477), 
ultrasonographic findings (p=0.139), and detailed histopatho￾logical findings (p=0.064). However, statistically significant dif￾ference was noted between the groups with respect to WBC 
count (p=0.002), neutrophil count (p=0.002), lymphocyte 
count (p=0.032), platelet count (p=0.032), RDW (p=0.001), 
CRP level (p=0.009), PNR (p=0.042), WNR (p=0.03), and ap￾pendix length (p<0.001).
The negative appendectomy rate was relatively higher in the 
LT group than in the non-LT group, but this difference was 
not statistically significant (30.8% vs. 21.2%; p=0.477). Similar￾706 Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg, September 2020, Vol. 26, No. 5

ly, the clinical and histopathologically-proven perforated AAp 
rate was higher in the LT group than in the non-LT group; 
however, this difference also was not statistically significant 
(30.8% vs. 9.6%; p=0.070). There was no significant difference 
between the two groups in terms of postoperative wound 
infection, wound dissociation, intra-abdominal abscess, and 
adjacent organ injury. In both groups, the subcutaneous col￾lection was treated with simple drainage in only one patient.

Comparison of the LT and No-LT appendectomy groups in

DISCUSSION
AAp is the most common disease requiring emergency surgi￾cal therapy worldwide and its current global incidence is 100–
151 per 100.000 population.[9,10] Conversely, its incidence fol￾lowing solid organ transplantation is low compared to that 
in the normal population. However, as the frequency of solid 
organ transplantation is increasing with enhanced survival 
due to recent advancements in immunosuppressive therapy, 
the incidence of AAp in this subgroup of patients is increas￾ing.[5,8,9,11] The first publication regarding AAp in patients with 
LT was published in 2005 by Abt et al.,[11] and since then, 14 
articles have been published with one being a review article.
[2–16] Our literature review with 33 LT patients who received 
appendectomy for AAp has been summarized in Table 3. The 
studies in the field show that AAp incidence in patients with 
LT ranges between 0.09%–0.67%.[4,6,8,9,11,15] De’Angelis et al.[5]
found that AAp developed in 0.29% of the transplant patients 
and 38.9% of them had undergone an LT. In our opinion, the 
term incidence used for documenting AAp occurrence fol￾lowing solid organ transplantation is inappropriate, consider￾ing its low rate of occurrence. In fact, we believe “prevalence” 
is a better term to define the frequency of this disease in 
transplant patients.
It has been suggested by many researchers that the classical 
signs and symptoms of AAp, such as right lower quadrant 
pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and fever, are not 
observed in transplant patients due to the suppressive ef￾fects of immunosuppressive therapy, which in turn delay the 
diagnosis and increase the complication rates observed. On 
the contrary, some researchers state that in this subgroup of 
patients, the signs and symptoms of the disease are not dif￾ferent; rather, the severity of the symptoms may be altered.
[4,6–8] It has been suggested that combined immunosuppressive 
therapy used, especially in the early post-transplant period, 
could mask the symptoms of AAp by suppressing the inflam￾matory response and result in atypical manifestations of the 
disease.[7] Furthermore, graft-related complications encoun￾tered in the early post-transplant period could also mask the 
clinical manifestations of the AAp.[9]
As a result of the literature analysis we performed, fever-re￾lated data of 21 patients were retrieved, and 66.7% of these 
patients developed a fever during AAp episodes. In our 
case-control study, we found that 23.7% of the patients with 
LT had a fever during the development of AAp. In the lit￾erature, the interval between LT and development of AAp 
was reported to be 8–5430 days, and in 24.2% of the pa￾tients, AAp developed in the first 15 days following LT. Our 
case-control study showed that in 7.7% of the patients, AAp 
developed in the first postoperative month. Thus, based on 
our results, we disagree with the idea of the other research￾ers[7] proposing that AAp develops in the early postoperative 
period in LT patients.
Some researchers have proposed that immunosuppressive 
therapy reduces the leukocyte count and suppresses the in￾flammatory response leading to a delayed diagnosis of AAp.
[7,8,14] The opponents of this hypothesis state that there is, 
in fact, no difference concerning leukocyte count between 
transplanted and non-transplanted patients with AAp. Shep￾pard and colleagues[6] have stated that leukocytosis was ob￾served in 73% of the LT patients with AAp, comparable to 
that in the non-transplanted patient population, and their 
hypothesis was supported by Savar et al.[4] Our literature re￾view showed that 28 of the 33 patients reported had data 
regarding leukocyte count, and 71.4% of these patients had 
leukocytosis (>10.000 cells/mm3
). In our case-control study, 
leukocytosis was observed in 30% of the LT patients in con￾trast to 76.9% of the non-transplant patients during the study 
period. The results of the study by Fonseca-Neto et al.[8] are 
consistent with the findings obtained in our study. All in all, 
our results and the results of previous studies regarding this 
subject are contradictory. However, in our experience of 
over 2500 cases of LT, leukocyte levels in the post-transplant 
period are lower than the normal range observed in the gen￾eral population as a result of immunosuppressive therapy. 
The diagnosis of AAp in LT patients requires evaluation of 
anamnesis, physical examination findings, laboratory values, 
and imaging studies. The differential diagnosis in LT patients 
with AAp should include intraabdominal infections, gastro￾intestinal perforations, biliary fistula, graft-related complica￾tions, rejection, and vascular thrombosis.[8,9,15] As previously 
discussed, the leukocyte count and inflammatory response 
are reduced in immunosuppressed individuals. On the con￾trary, some studies state that inflammatory markers, such as 
RDW and CRP level, are elevated significantly in LT patients 
in contrast to non-transplant patients. However, when ana￾lyzed in detail, these parameters were found to be especially 
increased in complicated cases.[17] Therefore, although sta￾tistically not significant, a higher perforation rate in the LT 
patients may explain the elevated CRP and RDW levels. Fur￾ther, even though ultrasonography is a very effective diagnos￾tic tool when performed by experienced personnel, abdomi￾nal computerized tomography is both effective in diagnosing 
complications related to the transplanted graft and also has 
higher sensitivity (91% vs. 78%) and specificity (90% vs. 83%) 
when compared to ultrasonography.[6,8] Radiological studies 
are especially useful in post-transplant patients in whom leu￾kocytosis is not observed.[9,15]
The majority of researchers have found no difference con￾cerning the etiopathogenetic factors of AAp between trans￾plant and non-transplant patients.[8,9,15] However, there are

some opponents of this opinion.[6] In fact, luminal obstruction 
and bacterial overgrowth are the two triggering factors in the 
development of clinical AAp.[8] Our literature review revealed 
that only one LT patient had acute appendicitis due to CMV 
infection.[13] Further, CMV-associated AAp is more common 
after kidney and bone marrow transplantation.
The gold standard therapeutic option for AAp is open or 
laparoscopic appendectomy. The timing of appendectomy 
depends on the development of complications (pylephlebitis, 
periappendicular abscess, and plastron) at the time of diag￾nosis. The basic principles of management for AAp in LT pa￾tients are the same as those for non-transplant patients. Our 
literature review showed that 27 transplanted patients had 
received open appendectomy, whereas five transplanted pa￾tients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy.[2,6,7,13,14] In the 
remaining patient, a perforation was noticed during laparo￾scopic exploration and the operation was converted to open 
surgery.[3] Although laparoscopic surgery is recommended in 
the early postoperative period, laparoscopic appendectomy 
may also be performed many years after the transplant sur￾gery.[2,6,7,13,14] The first trocar should always be placed under 
direct vision during laparoscopic appendectomy. In the open 
approach, if the diagnosis is confirmed in the preoperative 
period, a McBurney incision is preferred. Conversely, in cases 
with uncertain diagnoses, the old incision or midline incision 
should be used for the exploration of the abdomen.[15] In the 
present case-control study, 12 LT patients underwent opera￾tion through the McBurney incision, and one patient received 
a paramedian incision for an appendectomy. 
The most dreaded complications of appendicitis in trans￾plant patients are perforation and intraabdominal sepsis. The 
rate for perforation in the non-transplant population ranges 
between 4–41.5%, whereas it was reported to be 0–50% in 
LT patients.[8,11,18] Abt et al.[11] showed that in LT patients in 
whom the diagnosis was delayed or the admission was de￾layed by three days, the perforation rate was 75%. This is sup￾ported by many other researchers.[2,9] Our literature review 
showed that among the 26 patients with documented opera￾tive parameters, the perforation rate was 30.7%, and no mor￾tality case was noted.[3,7,8,11] In previous literature, during the 
4–2220 days of follow up, only one case of mortality related 
to AAp was observed.[9] In the present study, 30.8% of the 13 
LT patients developed perforation and none of the patients 
died. In our opinion, the main causes of perforation were the 
non-specific symptoms observed in the patients enrolled and 
late admission to the emergency department. Conversely, a 
high negative appendectomy rate in our institution may be at￾tributable to our decision to operate in LT patients suspected 
to have AAp to avoid any complications.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this study is the first study 
to compare AAp in LT patients to that in the normal popu￾lation. WBC and neutrophil counts that are biomarkers of 
inflammation were lower in LT patients; however, the CRP 
level and RDW, markers of severe appendicitis, were higher 
in the LT patients. Although AAp has been known to be more 
frequent in the early post-transplant period, we showed that 
it may occur at any time following LT. Further, the rates of 
perforation and negative appendectomy were higher in LT pa￾tients than in the normal population, although this difference 
was not statistically significant. We believe that our results 
are relevant as, to our knowledge, this is the first and largest 
study on this subject concerning design and the number of 
cases reported. In addition, since AAp after LT is a very rare 
clinical entity, the multicentric study should be designed to 
comprehensively evaluate AAp in transplanted patients.

AMAÇ: Bu çalımanın amacı akut apandisit ön tanısıyla apendektomi olmuş karaciğer transplantlı ve transplant dışı hastaları karşılaştırmaktır.
GEREÇ VE YÖNTEM: Posttransplant dönemde akut apandisit ön tanısıyla apendektomi yapılan 13 karaciğer transplantlı hasta (transplant grubu) ile 
aynı dönemde apendektomi olmuş transplant dışı 52 hasta (non-transpalnt grubu) demografik ve klinikopatolojik özellikler yönünden karşılaştırıldı. 
Transplant ve non-transplant gruplar 1:4 rastgele eşleştirme yöntemi kullanılarak oluşturuldu. Devamlı değişkenlerin karşılaştırılmasında Mann￾Whitney U-testi kullanılırken kategorik değişkenlerin karşılaştırılmasında Fisher kesin testi kullanıldı. P değeri <0.05 istatistiksel anlamlılık sınırı olarak 
kabul edildi.
BULGULAR: Bu çalışmaya yaşları 1 ile 84 yıl arasında değişen toplam 65 hasta alındı. Non-transplant grubundaki 52 hastanın (32 erkek ve 20 kadın) 
17 ile 84 yıl arasında değişirken transplant grubundaki 13 hastanın (9 erkek ve 4 kadın) yaşları 1 ile 64 yıl arasında değişmekteydi. Gruplar arasında 
WBC (p=0.002), nötrofil (p=0.002), lenfosit (p=0.032), trombosit (p=0.032), RDW (p=0.001), CRP (p=0.009), PNR (p=0.042), WNR (p=0.03) 
ve apendiks uzunluğu (p<0.001) açısından istatistiksel olarak anlamlı farklılıklar saptandı. Negatif apendektomi oranı transplant grubunda nisbeten 
daha yüksek olmakla birlikte bu farklılık istatistiksel olarak anlamlı değildi (%30.8 ve %21.2; p=0.477). Perfore apandisit transplant grubunda çok 
daha sık görülmekle birlikte bu farklılık istatistiksel olarak anlamlı değildi (%30.8 ve %9.6; p=0.070).
TARTIŞMA: WBC ve nötrofil LT grubunda daha düşüktü; CRP ve RDW LT grubunda daha yüksekti. Perforasyon ve negatif apendektomi oranları 
LT grubunda daha yüksekti, ancak bu fark istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bulunmamıştır.
Anahtar sözcükler: Akut apandisit; karaciğer alıcıları; karaciğer nakli; negatif apendektomi; perfore apandisit.
