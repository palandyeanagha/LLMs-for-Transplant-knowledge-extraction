Abstract
In Tanzania, the first cases of schistosomiasis were reported in the early 19th century. Since then, various studies
have reported prevalences of up to 100% in some areas. However, for many years, there have been no sustainable
control programmes and systematic data from observational and control studies are very limited in the public
domain. To cover that gap, the present article reviews the epidemiology, malacology, morbidity, and the milestones
the country has made in efforts to control schistosomiasis and discusses future control approaches. The available
evidence indicates that, both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are still highly endemic in Tanzania and cause
significant morbidity.Mass drug administration using praziquantel, currently used as a key intervention measure, has
not been successful in decreasing prevalence of infection. There is therefore an urgent need to revise the current
approach for the successful control of the disease. Clearly, these need to be integrated control measures.

Review
Background
Human schistosomiasis is second only to malaria in sub￾Saharan Africa (SSA) for causing severe morbidities.
Of the world's 207 million estimated cases of schisto￾somiasis, 93% occur in SSA and the United Republic of
Tanzania is the second country that has the highest bur￾den of schistosomiasis in the region, Nigeria being the
first [1,2]. Two major schistosome species are prevalent
in the region, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma
haematobium causing intestinal and urogenital schisto￾somiasis, respectively [1,2]. In Tanzania, numerous sur￾veys have been conducted in the past and more recently
to describe the epidemiology, transmission (malacology),
clinical trials of anti-schistosomes and control efforts
against schistosomiasis (both intestinal and urogenital
schistosomiasis), however, this information is very lim￾ited in the public domain where they can be easily
accessed by public health intervention managers and
policy makers. Availability of this information will not
only help in implementation of control programs but
also will serve to guide control activities in areas with
the greatest needs and allocation of resources such as
drugs. In attempts to cover that gap, the present article,
reviews the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, past
and current control approaches and the progress Tanzania
has made to control the disease. Clinical features and
treatments are discussed. Our review supports the need to
reverse the current control approach based on preventive
chemotherapy, to an integrated multidisciplinary control
approach.

Mwanza, Tanzania. The centre has a library established
in the 1940’s with archives of information since 1850.
To identify relevant studies on schistosomiasis in
Tanzania, the search initially began with the text string
“schistosom*” and a combination of the following words
in permutations were used: “epidemiology”, “epidemi￾ology + Tanzania/Tanganyika”, “Schistosoma mansoni +
Tanzania/Tanganyika”, and “Schistosoma haematobium
+ Unguja + Pemba”, “schistosomiasis + Zanzibar”,
“Biomphalaria/Bulinus + Tanzania/Tanganyika”. Avail￾able literature was categorized into population-based
studies, clinical trials and basic malacology. Inclusion
criteria were used with less stringency for the articles or
papers that reported co-infections of schistosomiasis and
other tropical diseases in Tanzania.
The past and current epidemiology of schistosome
infections in Tanzania
Historical studies have revealed that both Schistosoma
haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni have been en￾demic for a long time in Tanzania. The first scientific re￾port of schistosomiasis in Tanzania can be traced back
to 1895 when Manson-Bahr published the first recorded
case of intestinal bilharziasis [3,4]. The early studies in
the Lake Victoria province (Tanzania mainland) by Cook
in 1905 at Kwimba identified and described the distribu￾tion of S. mansoni and S. haematobium in the region
[3,5]. Over 50% of individuals examined had urogenital
schistosomiasis [5] and S. mansoni was noted to be
widespread on the southern and eastern shores of Lake
Victoria [5]. In 1903, urogenital schistosomiasis was
noted to be prevalent among men by Petrie in Zanzibar
[6,7]. However, it was not until 1925 that urogenital
schistosomiasis epidemiology was described [3,7]. Other
schistosomes species found in the country include Schis￾tosoma bovis, Schistosoma matheei and Schistosoma lei￾peri which infect bovine species [8,9].
Since the 1920s to date, large and small scale epi￾demiological surveys have been conducted in the coun￾try to determine the distribution [10-12], intermediate
hosts [11-13], prevalences and intensity of both urogeni￾tal and intestinal schistosomiasis [14-18]. The results
revealed that schistosomiasis was highly endemic
throughout the country and the level of endemicity var￾ied from region to region. The north-western regions,
surrounding Lake Victoria, the northern, central, south￾ern and south east of the country were identified to be
highly endemic for S. mansoni [11,13,17],while the hin￾terland areas of the country were highly endemic for S.
haematobium [14,15,18].
The distribution of S. mansoni and S. haematobium
were reviewed by McCullough in 1972 and Doumenge
in 1987 [3,19] and their reports indicated that the distri￾bution of S. mansoni was found to be characteristically
focal but the main extensive zones were found in the
south eastern and south western sides of Lake Victoria
and its island [19]. Schistosoma haematobium was widely
distributed and two extensive zones where noted to have
high transmission, namely the inland on the eastern and
south-eastern hinterland of Lake Victoria and lowland
zones on the eastern coast of the country [19].
The islands of Unguja and Pemba (Zanzibar islands)
were only endemic to Schistosoma haematobium and
the geographical distribution of the disease was largely
restricted to north-western and central areas of Unguja
Island [3,6,7,19-22]. However, Pemba Island, was en￾demic for S. haematobium on the western, southern,
central and northwest of the island [23-27]. Two trans￾mission seasons of the disease were noted in the islands
part of the country: the high season, accompanying
the long rains which end in between June/July, and
low transmission during the dry seasons [28]. It was
observed that S. mansoni was of little public health im￾portance in the two islands due to absence of its inter￾mediate hosts: snails, the Biomphalaria species [3,7,19].
The construction of the hydroelectric dams and devel￾opment of irrigations schemes in the late 1970s and
early 1980s to meet the needs of the growing population
for food production and water supply altered the trans￾mission pattern of schistosomiasis in the country. These
water development projects were identified as the risk
areas for transmission of schistosomiasis for communi￾ties that lived and worked in areas surrounding the
hydroelectrical dams and irrigation schemes. The areas
created favourable environmental conditions for the
snail intermediate hosts and the major impact was that
the disease was seen to spread to the areas that were not
previously known to be endemic [12,29-35].
Of the national population of 17.5 million people
(Tanzania mainland) in 1977, a total of 3.3 million (19%)
people were conservatively estimated to have constant
exposure risk to schistosomiasis [36]. According to the
estimates in national surveys of 1979–1980, 28.3% of the
population of mainland Tanzania (an approximate of 4.3
million people) and 23.2% (approximate 3.9 million
people) had urogenital and intestinal schistosomaisis,
respectively [36,37]. The nationwide survey conducted in
1980 among schoolchildren (aged between 9 and 14
years old) showed that more than 50% had S. haemato￾bium infection, the majority living in the endemic zones
of western and eastern parts of the country [3,36,37]. In
1990, for the projected population of 23.8 million
people, the estimated national prevalence for schisto￾somiasis was 51.5% (an approximate of 12.3 million
people with schistosomiasis infection) [36].
Today, both urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis
remains as a major public health problem in Tanzania that
are endemic at varying transmission levels in all

administrative regions. Schistosoma haematobium is widely
distributed while the endemic areas for S. mansoni are
mostly focal [3,38,39]. Recently, attempts have been made
to map the distribution and risk areas for schistosomiasis
transmission using geographical information systems
(GIS), remote-sensing (RS) and spatial analysis Figure 1
[40-45]. The observed geographical distribution supports
the previous historical mapping on schistosomiasis in the
country. Specifically, S. haematobium is highly endemic
along the eastern and south-eastern coasts, the islands of
Unguja and Pemba (Zanzibar) and the interland areas of
the north-western zones of the country [41]. These have
been identified as potential areas for the intermediate-host
snail species responsible for transmission of S. haematobium
[41]. Schistosoma mansoni is absent on the coastal area due
to the absence of its intermediate host snails and thermal
exclusion [42,43] but is dominant along the shores and
islands of Lake Victoria [19].
In the last decade, attempts have been made to esti￾mate the population infected or at risk of contracting
schistosomiasis in Tanzania [38,46]. In 2000, it was esti￾mated that, of the 29.6 million people in Tanzania, 15.4
million were infected with both urogenital and intestinal
schistosomiasis [37]. In 2009, it was estimated that ap￾proximately 19 million people are infected with schisto￾somiasis [47]. The recent report of 2012 indicated that
of the estimated population of 43.5 million people, about
23,189,294 million are infected with schistosomiasis (the
country prevalence estimated to be 51.5% [48]. Because
of the wide distribution of schistosomiasis, the entire
population of approximately 43.5 million people remains
at risk of the disease and the prevalence of the disease
appears to increase with increase in population size
(from the prevalence of 19% in 1977 to approximately
51.5% in 2012).
Malacological survey and disease transmission
The early malacological surveys to incriminate fresh
water snails as intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis
started in 1879 in Unguja islands [46,48], where Isidora

(Physopsis) ovoidea was identified as the likely inter￾mediate host of S. haematobium [49,50]. Mozley in 1938
studied the molluscs of the continental part of the coun￾try, around the coastal area, the shores of Lake Victoria
and the islands and identified Physopsis globosa as the
intermediate host of S. haematobium [51].
The earlier reviews of Sturrock [12], McCullough [19]
and Brown [51] in the 1970s and 1980s revealed that
three Planorbidae were the principal intermediate hosts
of S. haematobium, which includedBulinus nasutus,
Bulinus globosus and Bulinus africanus. Bulinus nasutu￾soccurred in the hinterland areas and was commonly
observed in a variety of permanent water bodies, which
were small and man-made, such as quarry excavations
for road construction, rice paddies, swampy pools and
temporary water sources throughout the country
[3,12,51,52]. Bulinusafricanus and B. globosus were
reported to inhabit permanent and larger water bodies
both on the hinterland and coastal plain and were com￾monly seen in temporal streams [3,12,27,51,52].
Molecular data and anatomical classification of the
intermediate hosts of schistosomes have helped to re￾solve the taxonomic identification of important inter￾mediate hosts of schistosomes in Tanzania [52-57].
Through the use of DNA characterization technique, it
is now clear that on Unguja island Bulinus globosus is
the main intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium
[53,56,58]. Although Bulinus nasutushas been identified
to exist on the island, it is noteworthy that it is not the
intermediate host of S. haematobium [53,56,58]. These
observations indicate that the transmission of S. haema￾tobium in Unguja could only take place within the distri￾bution ranges of B. globosus [53,56,58,59]. On Unguja
Island, the distribution of urogenital schistosomiasis
corresponds with the distribution of B. globosus
[53,56,58,59]. Bulinus globosushas been commonly
observed towards the north of the island [56]. On Pemba
Island, both B. globosus and B. nasutus are important
intermediate hosts of S. haematobium, with the latter
restricted to the eastern central border of the island but
not widely spread [58].
In the mainland part of the country, there are several
species of Bulinus and Biomphalaria responsible for
transmission of urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis
[13,54]. The potential intermediate hosts of S. mansoni
are Biomphalaria choanomphala, Biomphalaria pfeifferi,
Biomphalaria sudanica and Biomphalaria angulosa
[13,19]. Biomphlaria choanomphala is restricted to the
large water bodies such as Lake Victoria and hydroelec￾trical dams in southern and east-south of the country,
whereas B. sudanica is commonly observed in dams, in
permanent and seasonal water sources around the
southern shores of Lake Victoria and on the northern
part of the country [12,13,19,56]. Biomphlaria pfeifferi
has a widespread distribution and occurs throughout the
inland (almost 2/3 of the country). The species is com￾monly observed in seasonal water sources and swamps
whereas the B. angulosa is commonly seen in swamps in
southern highlands [13,19,52]. For S. haematobium, the
main intermediate hosts are Bulinus africanus, B. globo￾sus and B. nasutus [19,60-62]. On the eastern coastal
areas, B. globosus is the main snail host responsible for
transmission [51]. However, B. africanus is also present
in the area but has local importance [51]. By contrast, B.
nasutus is the major intermediate host in north-western
region and is commonly seen in temporary water bodies
[15,19,54]. The geographical distribution of important
snail intermediate hosts and attempted control measures
are presented in Table 1.
The distribution and density of the intermediate snail
host is an important determinant, accounting to a large
extent for seasonal transmission of the disease
[3,12,27,51]. The absence of members of the susceptible
species of the planorbid genus Biomphalaria along the
east coast areas and on the two islands of Unguja and
Pemba is associated with the apparent absence of S.
mansoni transmission in these areas [12,19]. Similarly,
the distribution of S. haematobium and S. mansoni along
Lake Victoria is largely related to the distribution of the
intermediate hosts [65]. Along the shore of the lake
members of the genus Biomphalaria are common
[13,67] with populations living along the lake shores and
islands being highly affected by S. mansoni as the risk of
infection increases [67,68]. For S. haematobium, Bulinus
species occurs far inland from the lake shores [14-16]
and transmission of the infection is very common in the
hinterland areas, except for parts of Kagera region where
transmission does not occur due to the absence of these
intermediate hosts [13,52,54,61,67].
Epidemiology and transmission
The prevalence, intensity of infection, and transmission
intensity of schistosomiasis is determined by numerous
factors including socio-economic, human behaviour,
ecology and biological factors which influence the inter￾actions between human and animal hosts and life cycle
stages of the parasites.
Human water contact behaviours and transmission patterns
The various permanent and temporal water bodies exist￾ing in the country contribute significantly to the eco￾epidemiological transmission of schistosomiasis. The
inland water bodies on the southern shore of Lake Victoria
contribute significantly to the transmission of S. haemato￾bium [13,52,54,61,67]. Malacological and ecological surveys
have identified several of the inland water bodies infested
with Bulinus species (B. nasutus, B. africanus and B.
globosus), which were shedding cercariae [61,68]. Large

water bodies such as Lake Victoria, hydroelectrical dams
and irrigations schemes (paddy and sugarcane irrigation
schemes) are inhabited by Biomphalaria species (B. chao￾nomphala, B.sudanica and B.pfeifferi) [29-34]. The major￾ity of the transmission of schistosomiasis occurs within
the large water bodies, dams, irrigation schemes and in
seasonal/temporal water bodies, predominantly around
Lake Victoria shores and its islands. Dams and irrigation
schemes for S. mansoni and the eastern coast belt and the
Unguja and Pemba islands are predominant areas for S.
haematobium [3,19]. To date, studies on human water
contact and the influence of socio-economic factors on
the transmission of schistosomiasis are very limited in
Tanzania. These types of studies from other schistosomia￾sis endemic countries, using direct observations or
interviews/surveys [75-78] have contributed significantly
to identifying high risk individuals and groups in areas
with focal transmission of the disease [28,75-78]. High
water contact is a risk factor and a means of becoming
infected for groups involved in fishing, farming, washing
in water bodies and swimming [28,75-78]. Among these
groups, high water contact behaviour is gender related.
Males are reported to have higher water contact behav￾iour than females [28,75-78]. In addition, high water
contact in males has been observed to correspond with
a high peak of cercarial shedding [28,75-78]. Age-related
water contact behaviour has also been observed. Studies
in Africa have reported high water contact in the age
group < 21 years and other studies in age group > 21
year [28,75-78].

In Tanzania, human exposure to schistosomiasis is
mostly related to occupational activities such as fishing,
farming or recreational activities around the basin or
within the permanent or temporal water bodies such as
lakes, rivers, dams, swampy areas or road side ditches.
There is variation in water contact behaviour from one
region to another region due to differences in distance
to water bodies, socio-economic conditions and eco￾logical variation [28,75-78] Figure 2.
The transmission pattern of schistosomiasis is seasonal
and alternates between rainy and dry seasons [15,16]. In
areas surrounding the southern shore of Lake Victoria
and on Unguja Island, two distinct transmission seasons
of S. haematobium have been observed [13,16,52]. The
first season is observed between February- May and is
concurrent with the long rainy seasons [13,16,52]. Dur￾ing this season, the number of temporal water bodies in
hinterland increases, volume of water in seasonal rivers
increases and the female Bulinus species starts to lay a
large number of eggs which hatch by the end of long
rainy season [15,16]. Thus, shortly after the long rainy
season, the population density of Bulinus increases and
both young and mature snails shed cercariae at high
rates [13,16,52]. At the start of the dry season, between
June and July, the ambient temperature increases and
creates a favourable environment for human water con￾tact through swimming and fishing. This exposure to
cercariae infested water increases the rate of disease
transmission [13,16,52]. The second transmission season
is observed during the dry season (July – September/
October) characterized by decreased Bulinus population
density, drying out of most of the temporal water bodies,
decreased water volume in seasonal rivers and no agri￾culture work in the hinterland areas [13,16,52]. The
adult snails die during the dry season and the young
snails undergo aestivation under the soil to ensure sur￾vival during the next season and species survival adapta￾tion [13,16,52]. During this period, the transmission rate
is low and sporadic. However, in other areas the trans￾mission pattern is observed shortly after the short dry
season [54].
For S. mansoni, in the hinterland areas, the transmis￾sion pattern follows that of S. haematobium due to sea￾sonality of water bodies. However, in permanent water
bodies, such as around Lake Victoria, irrigation schemes
or around hydroelectrical dams, the transmission is dif￾ferent and does not occur in seasons. In these areas,
there is continual transmission with slight or no differ￾ence between the rainy and dry season [13,15,16,52].
Primate - Human schistosomiasis transmission
The zoonotic transmission of S. mansoni between
human and other primates occurs in Tanzania, but this
topic has received little attention [79-81]. Monkeys and
baboons are known to be infected by S. mansoni in their
ecological areas [79-81]. Studies involving these primates
in their vicinity or protected national parks have
reported high incidence of S. mansoni in monkeys and
baboons. These primates act as reservoirs for the infec￾tion to humans and play a major role in the transmission
of the disease [79-81]. However, the potential roles
played by monkeys/baboons as reservoir hosts of human
schistosome infections have never been studied in detail.
The movement of baboons from the national parks to
human settlements may establish transmission of intes￾tinal schistosomiasis in areas known to be free of the
disease, especially if the intermediate hosts are present
in that area. Thus, advanced studies are required to
understand the roles played by baboons/monkeys in the
dynamic transmission of intestinal schistosomiasis.
Population prevalence and intensity of infection
Like other schistosomiasis endemic countries, in Tanzania
the prevalence of schistosomiasis and intensity of infection
varies between geographical areas, age groups and gender.
Studies have reported high prevalences (40% to 100%) of
S. mansoni in populations living along the Lake Victoria
shores and within islands, irrigation schemes and around
the hydroelectrical dams [5,17,44,45,82-84]. For S. haema￾tobium, the high prevalence is observed in hinterland
areas located on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, the
eastern coastal areas and on Unguja and Pemba islands
Figure 2 Active water contact activities such as fishing, fetching water direct from the lake and agriculture along the lake basin
increases the risk of S. mansoni transmission on the southern shore of the Lake Victoria, north-western Tanzania.

[3,10,11,14,15,18,19]. Prevalence and infection intensity
are highest among school children <15 years of age
[36,37]. The age distribution pattern of schistosomia￾sis has been reported to peak between ages 10–19
years and decrease there after with increased age
[36,37]. Similarly, a gender variation in prevalence of
S. mansoni appears to have a variation and the varia￾tions are attributed to differences in economic activ￾ities and exposure to cercariae infested water. Males
are exposed more to water during fishing and swim￾ming as compared to females [36,37,85]. In terms of
age variation in prevalence, community studies have
observed individuals aged < 30 years having higher
S. mansoni prevalence as compared to those who
were > 30 years [83-85]. Similarly, for S. haemato￾bium infection an age-dependent pattern of infection
peaks at the age group of 5–19 years old and a de￾crease in the >20 year-olds [86]. The intensity of in￾fection differs significantly between males and females
with mainly young age groups (14–19 years old) diag￾nosed with heavy infection both for S. mansoni and
S. haematobium [5,82,83,86]. Development of immun￾ity against schistosomiasis is attributed to the age pat￾tern observed and the decrease of the prevalence and
intensity of infection at older ages.
In communities where occupational exposure is un￾avoidable for a large proportion of the adult population,
for example in fishing and farming communities, adults
are more exposed to cercarial infested water than the
young generation due to their occupations, such as
paddy cultivation in swamps or fishing in lakes
[54,65,86]. This age difference in prevalence and infec￾tion intensity can also be influenced by school based
control approaches, in which the control intervention is
only centered around school children and the adult
population is not included, which has been for example,
observed in China and the Philippines [87,88].
Schistosomiasis pathology and patterns of morbidity
Chronic schistosomiasis (both intestinal and urogenital)
results from the host’s immune response against the egg
antigens (hepatotoxins -Omega-1) which reach the body
tissue through the micropores in the egg shells and
[89,90]. The hepatotoxins provoke an eosinophilic re￾sponse and type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions
mediated through T helper cell (Th2) immune response
to antigens [89,90]. The immunological reaction pro￾duced eventually leads to formation of granuloma, which
ends up as a fibrosis formation [89,90]. The resulting
pathology depends on several factors such as host￾parasite genetics [91], degree and length of exposure
[92], intensity of infection [92], host immune response
to the parasites and co-infections with other tropical dis￾eases such as malaria and HIV-1 [93,94]. Chronic
schistosomiasis associated with immune response
against eggs trapped in various body tissues is commonly
reported in Tanzania [4,83,84,86].
Chronic urogenital schistosomiasis
Schistosoma haematobium worms are strategically
located at the terminal venules, which tend to enhance
passage of the laid eggs to the lumen of the bladder, pel￾vic organs and rarely in the gastrointestinal organs [95].
The deposited eggs provoke granulomatous inflamma￾tion and the primary organ affected is the ureter
[89]. The developed lesions lead to the formation of
sandy patches, ulcerations and polypoid lesions in the
bladder and ureters, resulting in haematuria, obstruc￾tions of urine flow, calcified bladder wall and cancer
[14,18,95,96]. Common early signs include dysuria, pro￾teinuria, and haematuria [95-111]. The development of
urological abnormalities related to S. haematobium in￾fection is associated with the intensity of infection
[96,112-115]. Several epidemiological and clinical studies
conducted in Zanzibar (Unguja and Pemba) and the
mainland part of the country have reported high preva￾lences of S. haematobium and different types of morbid￾ities associated with urogenital schistosomiasis across
all age groups and gender (Table 2). The common
urogram abnormalities were calcified urinary bladder,
calcified and distorted ureters, hydronephrosis and non￾functioning kidney [96,112-116]. In addition, multiple or
bilateral lesions were also identified, including calcified
bladder, deformity of the ureter, hydronephrosis and
non-functioning kidneys [112-116]. A direct relationship
between intensity of infection and the abnormalities of
the urinary tract was observed, in which calcified urinary
bladders, deformed ureters and hydronephrosis were sig￾nificantly more common in schoolchildren who had
higher infection intensities (excreted >250 eggs/10ml of
urine) [112-115]. Similar findings were reported in
Unguja and the observed urological complications were
associated with high intensity of infection [112-115].
Ultrasonographical surveys in the south east of the
country, the areas endemic for S. haematobium, pro￾duced similar results, but the overall rate of urological
abnormalities was high [96]. Recently, factors such as
pain on micturating, urgency, loin pain, tired by midday,
self-reported frothy urine, self-perceived haematuria,
self-reported schistosomaisis in past year, detected
haematuria and presence of S. haematobium eggs in
urine were major risk factors for urinary tract abnormal￾ities detected by ultrasound [116]. Details of the results
of other studies on morbidities associated with urogeni￾tal schistosomiasis are presented in Table 2.
In Tanzania, genital schistosomiasis due to eggs of
S. haematobium trapped especially in the female repro￾ductive tract is a public health concern [120,123-125].

(6–19 years) was 21%. The highest prevalence was observed in both
sexes in the age group 15–19 years. Distinct variations in prevalence
were found between the individual schools examined, ranging from 5
to 71% and indicating a focal transmission of the disease. The intensity of
S. haematobium infection in the individual schools was relatively low,
ranging from 5 to 36 eggs/10 ml urine. However, the frequency of
microhaematuria among infected subjects was high, reaching 100%
from an egg output of 50 eggs/10 ml onwards. Forty-nine water-bodies,
most of them man-made-with Bulinus (Ph.) globosus and/or B. (Ph.)
nasutus were identified.

More males (23.5%) than females (15.0%) were infected, and the highest
prevalence was recorded in the 11–16 year old age group. Intensity of
infection was higher, ranging from 12 to 96 eggs/10 ml urine in individual
schools. 26% of the infected excreted more than 50 eggs/10 ml urine
and high rates of haematuria and proteinuria were observed in infected

study participants was observed both in the whole population and the
age group 5–19 years. The prevalence of participants excreting one or ≥
50 eggs/10 ml of urine ranged between 36% - 61%. Gross haematuria had
higher specificity (100%) in relation to positive filtration on any day of
examination and egg counts of ≥ 50 eggs/10mls of urine. Also a positive
reaction of haematuria of any day of examination was associated with the
study participants having a high egg count (≥ 50 eggs/10ml urine).

S. haematobium 879 individuals examined for S. haematobium and 520 had six days
complete urine samples examination. Overall prevalence based on urine
filtration technique was 26-34% and in the age group 5–19 years and the
highest prevalence of heavy infection was in the age group 10–14 years.
The prevalence of haematuria detected by the reagent strips was similar
to prevalence of infection as measured by the highest egg counts. Thus,
urine reagent strips are useful diagnostic indicators of S. haematobium.

S. mansoni Parasitological and ultrasonographical examination of 1,659 and 898
individuals for S. mansoni. High prevalence and intensity of infection in all
the three villages was observed, with children and adolescents more
infected than adults, and males excreting more eggs than females. Overall
prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 86.3% and mean egg output was
514 epg (geometrical mean egg output was 161.1 epg). Prevalence of
hepatomegaly (detected by ultrasonography) was 35% and 80% had
splenomegaly. Organomegaly was strongly associated with heavy epg.
For periportal fibrosis, 29.8% had grade I, 5.1% had grade II, 1.1% had
grade III and fibrosis was observed to increase with age. Late stage disease
with a high degree of periportal fibrosis, shrinking of the right lobe of the
liver and features of portal hypertension was seen in 2.1% of the individuals.
The overall level of schistosomal morbidity was classified as intermediate.

S. haematobium 533 school children examined for urinary tract pathologies. Baseline data
collection found urinary tract pathology in 67% of 533 children. Lesions of
the bladder were significantly associated with egg positivity and
microhematuria. The attributable fraction estimate of major bladder lesions
due to S. haematobium was 75%. In a cohort study, 224 infected children
were examined by ultrasound and then treated with a standard dose of
40 mg of praziquantel/kg of body weight. They were re-examined at two,
four, six, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. Before treatment, 76% had
pathologic lesions of the urinary tract. The proportion showing lesions
decreased sharply during the first months after treatment to 11% at six
months. At 24 months, lesions were detected in 57%, and 11% had
developed new severe pathology. In 18 cases, pathology was present
throughout, and 34 did not show any pathology throughout the study.

Symptoms such as bleeding disorders, ulcers, lower ab￾dominal pain and infertility are common among infected
women [120,123-125]. Gynecological and pathological
findings are mainly confined to the cervix, where com￾mon findings include so-called sandy patches, oedema,
erosions/ulcerations, and polyps [120,123-125]. In
addition, co-occurrence of genital S. haematobium infec￾tions and carcinoma of the uterine cervix or carcinomas
of the urinary bladder or prostate gland have been
reported Figure 3 [117,125,126]. The association be￾tween S. haematobium infection and squamous-cell car￾cinoma of the bladder has been the subject of debate for
a long time. Co-existence of squamous-cell or adenocar￾cinoma of the urinary bladder, prostate gland and eggs
of S. haematobium has been observed in hospitalized
cases [117,125,126]. Evidence from other studies indi￾cates an association between S. haematobium infections
and some types of bladder cancers [95]. In addition, S.
haematobium associated lesions in the reproductive
tract of women may facilitate the transmission of other
sexual diseases including HIV (Table 2) [121,127].
Chronic intestinal schistosomiasis
The predilection sites of S. mansoni are the mesenteric
veins. Eggs from the fertilized adult female worm tend to
transverse the large bowel walls, causing mild to severe
gut pathologies [128,129]. In mild infections, the symp￾toms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stool, nau￾sea, fatigue and drowsiness [83,129]. Eggs which do not
manage to pass through the intestinal mucosa to reach
the lumen are trapped in the mucosa or other parts, and
are swept by the portal blood flow. Because the eggs are
too large to pass through the sinusoidal plexus, they accu￾mulate in the presinusoidal venules within the portal
triads [128,129]. Immunological response against the
accumulated eggs results in extensive fibrosis of the liver,
which may lead to hepatomegaly or splenomegaly/hepa￾tosplenomegaly, venous obstructions, portal hypertension
and development of oesophageal varices [128-130]. The
rupture of collateral veins in oesophageal varices results in
haematemesis [129].
Detailed liver pathology, liver function and haemato￾logical findings associated with S. mansoni identified and
reported by various epidemiological and clinical surveys
are presented in Table 2 [17,82-84,119,122]. In clinical
studies common symptoms reported include vague ab￾dominal pain, general weakness, diarrhea, intermittent
dysentery and blood/mucus in stool [82,83,119]. Ultraso￾nographical examination has revealed high prevalences
of hepatomegaly and hepatomegaly, splenomegaly,
hepato-splenomegaly and portal fibrosis. A consistent in￾crease in the proportion of hepatomegaly and spleno￾megaly with increasing egg output has been observed.
Individuals with heavy infections had higher prevalence
of both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly [83,84,119,122].
Similarly, histological findings have demonstrated exten￾sive fibrosis and granulomatous lesions in liver sections
of individuals who had heavy infection intensity (≥ 500
epg) [82]. In addition, portal tract fibrosis was severe in
liver sections with ≥ 250 eggs of S. mansoni per gram of
faeces [82].
In pregnancy, S. mansoni is not only the cause of
hepatosplenomegaly and other morbidities, but has also
been associated with anaemia [118]. Heavy S. mansoni
infection (≥ 400 epg) was associated with anaemia [118].
In hospital reports, S. mansoni is the causal factor of ap￾pendicitis and intestinal obstructions Figure 4 [131].

Growth retardation and defects in cognitive function
Schistosomiasis infections during childhood have been
associated with growth retardation, anaemia and poor
cognitive functions [132-134]. Studies have shown that
light to severe infections of either S. mansoni or S. haema￾tobium are associated with stunted growth and under￾nutrition in infected children [132-135]. In Tanzania,
heavy infections of either S. mansoni or S. haematobium
were associated with reduced height and weight in
infected schoolchildren, in comparison to an uninfected
control group [132,133]. Importantly, heavy infection with
S. haematobium was associated with impaired mental per￾formance or poor cognitive function in Tanzanian school
children [134,136]. Evidence from randomized interven￾tion studies indicates that successful chemotherapy results
in successful but incomplete catch-up of growth, cognitive
function and haemoglobin levels [137].
Co-infection of schistosomiasis with other tropical diseases
In Tanzania, co-infection of schistosomiasis with other
infectious and parasitic diseases such as malaria, geohel￾minths and HIV are common [107,110,121,138-141]. In
primary school children, double or triple infections of
schistosomiasis with either malaria or Soil-Transmitted
Helminth infections are common [110,138]. In this age
group, malaria and hookworm infections cause and in￾fluence schistosomiasis-related morbidities such as hepa￾tosplenomegaly and anaemia [138,142]. Schistosomiasis
is reported to influence the severity of malaria infection
in school children [143,144]. Co-occurrence of S. hae￾matobium/S. mansoni and HIV-1 infections among rural
populations has been noted in Tanzania [121], and uro￾genital schistosomiasis was associated with HIV infec￾tion [121]. Emerging putative evidence suggests that
there are interactions of schistosomiasis and HIV-1
infections in Africa, with schistosomaisis reported to in￾crease susceptibility to HIV transmission and speed up
the progression of HIV/AIDS in Africa [145,146]. The
same holds for associations between hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and S. mansoni in￾fection [147]. As noted in previous studies, there is evi￾dence that co-infections of HBV and HCV and
S. mansoni are associated with deterioration of hepatic
function [147].
Past and current control of schistosomiasis in Tanzania
From the mid-1950s to 1970s, comprehensive control
measures were carried out with an emphasis on the con￾trol of the intermediate hosts. Various field trials were
conducted in the country, using molluscicides to control
intermediate snail hosts of S. haematobium and S. man￾soni species (Table 1) [63,70-74,85,148-151]. The com￾mon molluscicides studied and used in control of
intermediate snail hosts were N-tritylmorpholine,
niclosamide ethanolamine salt, sodium pentachlorophe￾nate and Bayer 73 (2-hydroxy-5, 2-dichloro-4-nitro-ben￾zanilide) [63,70-74,85,148-151]. After several field trials
of molluscicides, control programmes started and fo￾cused mainly in irrigation schemes and the control ap￾proach significantly reduced the incidence of S. mansoni
[63,70-74,85,148-152]. However, the wide distribution of
the intermediate snail host of schistosomiasis and their
habitats in the country did not allow large-scale country
coverage. In addition, molluscicides were expensive and
required substantial human and material resources for
efficient application [151]. In addition, the toxic nature
of the molluscicides to other aquatic macro and micro￾organisms gave rise to ecological concerns.
In the 1960s, the major antischistosomal drugs were
antimonials. Various clinical trials were conducted in the
country to evaluate their efficacy [153-159]. The main
antischistosomes were lucanthone hydrochloride, so￾dium antimony Dimercaptosuccinate (TWSb) and
ambilhar (a nitrothiazole derivative, 1-(5-nitro-2-thiazo￾lyl)-2-imidazole) [153-157]. The parasitological cure
rates of the antimonials varied widely. For instance,
TWSb for treatment of S. haematobium had 90% cure
rates among individuals with light infections but in indi￾viduals with heavy infection intensity, the cure rate was
below 40% [153-155]. In addition to low cure rates, the
antimonials were highly toxic, involved prolonged
courses of treatment and had very severe side effects
such as epileptiform seizures, psychoses, giddiness and
epistaxis [153-157]. Thus, most of these drugs were not
recommended for community mass treatment.
The current global strategy of schistosomiasis control
is to reduce morbidity by decreasing worm burden and
intensity of infection. The strategies aim to improve chil￾dren’s health and prevent irreversible complications in
adulthood. This has become possible by the use of prazi￾quantel, and the national control programme uses it
[160]. In 1986, a control programme for urogenital
schistosomiasis was initiated on the island of Pemba
(Pemba Schistosomiasis Control Programme, 1986–
1990) [23-27]. In 2003 the new Schistosomiasis Control
Programme (“Kick out Kichocho”) was launched in
Unguja. The two programs targeted school children and
offered praziquantel treatment. The report of Schisto￾somiasis Control Initiatives indicates that for the period
of three years (2004–2006), Zanzibar had successfully
completed a countrywide coverage treatment of all
school children, using praziquantel (www.sci-ntds.org).
At present, SCORE is supporting an ambitious operation
research in Pemba and Unguja aiming at (i) eliminating
schistosomiasis in Unguja in the coming three years and
interrupting transmission in the next five years (ii) to
control schistosomiasis in Pemba (prevalence < 10%) in
the next three years and to eliminate the disease in the
Mazigo et al. Parasites & Vectors 2012, 5:274 Page 14 of 20

next five years. The project was implemented in 2011
under the within the context of ongoing national control
and prevention efforts. Zanzibar Elimination of Schisto￾somiasis Transmission (ZEST) is working to achieve
these common goals and their results are highly waited.
A recent report from Unguja have indicated that the
prevalence of S. haematobium and other helminth infec￾tions have markedly declined on the island for the past
20–25 years and this was attributed to the morbidity
control programmes [161]. These findings are encour￾aging and call for the need of integrating control ap￾proach to meet the objectives of the SCORE project.
In 2004, the National Schistosomiasis and Soil￾transmitted Helminths Control Programme (NSSCP)
under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare was
established with support from the Schistosomiasis Con￾trol Initiative (SCI) on the mainland part of Tanzania
[162,163]. According to an NSSCP report, the school￾based Mass Deworming Treatment (MDA) has covered
21 regions and each region has received one, two or
three rounds of treatment [162].
In the country, various approaches have been used for
delivering treatment to endemic communities. The main
approach is the school-based MDA, where all primary
school children receive praziquantel (40 mg/kgBWT) ir￾respective of infection status (blanket mass treatment)
[162]. In this approach, school teachers administer treat￾ment to the school age children in their respective
schools. The school-based deworming programme is
advocated as a highly cost effective public health inter￾vention [162]. The other approach is the community￾directed treatment (ComDT) approach, where commu￾nities are empowered to decide their own methods of
distributing drugs, at their convenient time and ideal
places of delivery [111,164]. In reported cases, the com￾munities selected people whom they believe would be
able to distribute drugs to the children after training
[164]. The ComDT approach was at least as effective as
the school-based approach in reducing prevalence and
intensity of schistosomiasis among school children [164].
Public health education focusing on behavioral change,
treatment-seeking and sanitation forms an important
part of control programmes for schistosomiasis, espe￾cially in rural villages. Knowledge of local perceptions
and practices are important in designing and implemen￾tation of any of the schistosomiasis control approaches
[165]. At community level, qualitative and quantitative
studies have reported a fairly good knowledge of symp￾toms and health-seeking behaviour for schistosomiasis
[165,166]. On the other hand, poor knowledge on the
causes of schistosomiasis was observed [165,166]. Vari￾ous methods of health education have been tried and
practiced in risk groups such as school children, for in￾stance, in Unguja, to increase awareness and knowledge
of the school children about schistosomiasis. A booklet
titled “Juma na kichocho” (Juma and schistosomiasis)
was developed as a teaching aid [167]. However, the in￾formation from the booklet did not provide significant
changes in knowledge and attitudes of the school chil￾dren [167]. This was similar to other observations
around the Lake Victoria area, where the posters about
schistosomiasis provided in primary schools as a source
of information did not influence the children’s know￾ledge about the disease [166].
Future control of schistosomiasis: Integrated control
approach
Considering the wide distribution of schistosomiasis in
the country and the wide media of transmission, an inte￾grated and sustainable approach is required to control
the disease and its associated morbidities. A combin￾ation of approaches could be used in human hosts and
the intermediate hosts.
For human hosts, repeated mass chemotherapy using
praziquantel, public health education focusing on behav￾iour changes towards risk factors, improve sanitation/hy￾giene-constructions and use of toilets and supplying tap
water in risk groups such as fishing and farming com￾munities, changes of agriculture practices – cultivation
in flooded paddy fields and sugarcane plantations and
use of gumboots are important measures.
For the intermediate hosts, taking into consideration
the seasonal fluctuation of population density of inter￾mediates hosts, timed and selective mollusciciding be￾fore aestivation begins, and treatment of snail’s habitats
at the beginning of the rainy seasons would help to con￾trol the disease in small scale [16]. Furthermore, bio￾logical control- use of insects or fish, which will feed on
snails, or use of competitor snails, is another option for
small scale control [72,73].
Recently, integrated control approaches, which used
praziquantel treatment along with environmental im￾provement, water and sanitation, snail control and
public health education activities have been reported
to be highly effective, and the prevalence of schisto￾somiasis japonicum infection in human declined
to <1% in China and in regions of Indonesia (from
4.66% and 4.8% to 0.89% and 0.3% respectively)
[160,168].
The WHO, through its fifty-fourth World Health
Assembly resolution, has endorsed chemotherapy with
praziquantel as a public health strategy to control
schistosomiasis related morbidities [160]. In addition,
the resolution has recognized the importance of other
public health measures such as the use of safe tape
water, improving sanitation and public health educa￾tion as means to control schistosomiasis [160].

Conclusions
In general, Tanzania has made collective steps to under￾stand the transmission dynamics and control efforts of
schistosomiasis over the past seven decades. The evi￾dence revealed here indicates that despite considerable
efforts made to control schistosomiasis using various
approaches in Tanzania, the disease remains a serious
public health problem and its prevalence continues to
increase with increase in the population size.
Currently, to respond to the sixty-fifth World Health
Assembly resolution, which called for endemic countries
and the international community to allocate resources
for intensification of schistosomaisis control activities
[160], there are new efforts to control schistosomiasis in
Tanzania. The funding provided by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation and to the Schistosomiasis Initiatives
Control (SCI), and the commitment of the Tanzanian
government through the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare, has enabled millions of Tanzanian school chil￾dren to receive at least one to three rounds of prazi￾quantel treatment [162]. In addition, the call of the
central government of Tanzania to local district author￾ities to allocate budget for controlling schistosomiasis,
especially for buying and distributing drugs (praziquan￾tel) to risk groups (primary school children) are encour￾aging measures [169]. However, a single approach of
preventive chemotherapy using praziquantel alone can￾not overcome the problem of schistosomiasis in Tanza￾nia. There is a need for integrated control programs,
acting beyond preventive chemotherapy [160]. In fact,
there is a need for deliberate efforts to enforce health
education, and more action is needed in improving ac￾cess and supply of clean tap water and adequate sanita￾tion (especially the use of toilets) [160].
For preventive chemotherapy, there is a need to
expand treatment programs to other risk groups such
as fishermen, farmers and non-school going children.
Furthermore, with the expansion of praziquantel
distribution under SCI support (from 2004–2007,
about 36.75 million praziquantel tablets were received
in Tanzania), there is a need to understand the best
approach to distribute the drugs to communities
living in various endemic levels of schistosomaisis.
Another SCORE funded project is also going on
around the Lake Victoria aiming at understand the
best approach to distribute anthelminthic to commu￾nities with different endemicity level. We hope that
the two control projects will yield fruitful results for
the future control of the disease.
Lastly, in view of the fact that schistosomiasis occurs
in rural areas where the majority of the population are
highly stricken by poverty, improvement of the life
standard of these communities should go hand in hand
with schistosomaisis control activities.
