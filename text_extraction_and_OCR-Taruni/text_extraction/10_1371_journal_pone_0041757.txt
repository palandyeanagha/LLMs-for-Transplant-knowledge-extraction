Abstract
Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inhibition of the
renin-angiotensinsystem (RAS) in hypertension causes differential effects on central and brachial blood pressure (BP), which
has been translated into improved outcome. The objective was to examine if a more complete inhibition of RAS by
combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) compared to
monotherapy has an additive effect on central BP and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), which are known markers of CVD.
Methods: Sixty-seven CKD patients (mean GFR 30, range 13–59 ml/min/1.73 m2
) participated in an open randomized study
of 16 weeks of monotherapy with either enalapril or candesartan followed by 8 weeks of dual blockade aiming at a total
dose of 16 mg candesartan and 20 mg enalapril o.d. Pulse-wave measurements were performed at week 0, 8, 16 and 24 by
the SphygmoCor device.
Results: Significant additive BP independent reductions were found after dual blockade in aortic PWV (20.3 m/s, P,0.05)
and in augmentation index (22%, P,0.01) compared to monotherapy. Furthermore pulse pressure amplification was
improved (P,0.05) and central systolic BP reduced (26 mmHg, P,0.01).
Conclusions: Dual blockade of the RAS resulted in an additive BP independent reduction in pulse-wave reflection and
arterial stiffness compared to monotherapy in CKD patients.

Introduction
Markers of arterial stiffness such as aortic pulse-wave velocity
(PWV) and central blood pressure (BP) are known independent
predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic
kidney disease (CKD) [1–3]. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensinsys￾tem (RAS) with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)
or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to afford
cardio-renal protection beyond the BP lowering effects [4–8]. This
may be due to preferential lowering of the central BP by the RAS
blockers compared to other antihypertensives [9,10]. Central BP,
which is markedly influenced by vascular stiffness, has been found to
beabetter predictor ofcardiovascular outcomethantheconventional
brachial BP [11–13]. Treatment with combinations of ACEI and
ARB in full doses would expectedly leadto a more complete blockade
of the RAS than can be obtained with either drug group. Such dual
blockade has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on arterial
wave reflection and PWV in resistant hypertension [14,15].
Surprisingly, in the recent ONTARGET study no beneficial effect
of dual blockade on cardio-renal outcome was found in high risk
cardiovascular patients [16]. Furthermore, in another recent
observational study dual blockade did not reduce cardiovascular
death in chronic hemodialysis patients [17].
In the present study it was investigated for the first time whether in
CKD patients dual RAS blockade has an additive effect on central
pressure waves and arterial stiffness evaluated by pulse-wave analysis
(PWA) and PWV respectively, compared to mono RAS blockade,
and whether these effects if present are BP independent.

Study Population
Sixty-seven patients, all Caucasians, from the outpatient
nephrology clinic, Herlev University Hospital, 52 men and 15
women, mean age 60 (range 31–75) were enrolled in this open
randomised cross-over trial from September 2005 to September
2009. All patients gave informed consent and the study was
approved by the Ethical Committee of Copenhagen County. The
authors adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and the study was
monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit at
Copenhagen University Hospitals, and was registered by Eu￾draCT number 2005-001568-29 and in the public trial registry:
www.clinicaltrials.gov, registration number NCT00235287.
The eligibility criteria for patients entering the study were pre￾dialysis CKD with plasma creatinine between 150 and 350 mmol/
l, plasma potassium below 5.6 mmol/l, systolic BP above
109 mmHg and age between 18 and 75 years. Patients with
congestive heart failure (NYHA III-IV), chronic liver insufficiency,
amputation of a limb or the presence of cardiac arrhythmia or a
pacemaker were not included. None of the patients were to be
treated with immunosuppressives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, aldosterone antagonists or dual RAS blockade at the entry
of the study.
Seventy-two per cent of the patients were treated with ACEI or
ARB before enrolment and thus were known RAS blockade
tolerant. Additionally, most were treated with furosemide and non
ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy, which were continued
during the trial. Demographic data and renal diagnoses are
shown in table 1.
Study Protocol
In order to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at
any time during the trial, block randomization was used [18]. In
every block of 10 participants five would be allocated to each arm
of the trial.
Mono therapy period. Randomization of patients treated with
either an ACEI or an ARB prior to the study was carried out by drawing
a closed envelope; to ensure that half of the patients had enalapril
for the first 16 weeks and the other half had candesartan the first
16 weeks.
Randomization of patients not treated with an ACEI or ARB prior to the
study was likewise carried out by drawing an envelope from a bag
to ensure that half of the patients had enalapril in the first 8 weeks
and candesartan in the following 8 weeks and the other half of the
patients had candesartan in the first 8 weeks and enalapril in the
following 8 weeks. By this means, tolerance to either drug was
demonstrated in the patients not previously treated with RAS
blockers before dual blockade.
In either of the four randomized patient groups, doses were increased
gradually over a period of 8 weeks from enalapril 5 mg to 20 mg,
and from candesartan 4 mg to 16 mg, given once daily. All
randomisations were carried out by the GCP-trained nurse staff
members of the outpatient clinic without any conflict of interest in
the trial. A flowchart of the randomized patients in the study is
found in figure 1.
Dual blockade period. All patients: After 16 weeks of
monotherapy with either enalapril or candesartan, the comple￾mentary drug was added in incremental doses over a period of 5
weeks, aiming at reaching a combination of enalapril 20 mg and
candesartan 16 mg and maintaining this full dose dual blockade
for an additionally 3 weeks. The therapeutic goal was a systolic/
diastolic BP of 130/80 mmHg or below according to the K/
DOQI-guidelines [19]. Additional antihypertensive treatment was
simultaneously reduced, discontinued or added as needed.
During the 24 weeks study period, 10 control visits were
planned: 4 visits in the laboratory, at which pulse-wave
measurements were done and blood samples drawn, at the
beginning of the trial and after 8, 16 and 24 weeks; 6 ‘clinical
control’-visits in the outpatient clinic, at which BP was measured
and blood samples drawn. All the visits were planned with an
interval of 2–3 weeks throughout the study, so that 2 ‘clinical
control’-visits were placed between two pulse-wave measurements.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated at the first and last
visit in the trial by the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA as
described below. Urinary albumin excretion/24 h was measured
at each of the four visits of pulse-wave measurements.
Measurements of pulse-wave analysis and pulse-wave
velocity. Measurements of PWA and PWV were performed
using the SphygmoCor device [20] (version 7.0, Atcor Medical,
Sydney, Australia). All measurements were performed in the
morning in the supine position after a minimum of 10 min rest in
a quiet, temperature-controlled room. Patients were requested to
be fasting and abstain from tea, coffee and smoking for 8 h and
from alcohol for 24 h. Diabetic patients were allowed a light meal
before examination. Study and other morning medication were to
be taken 2 hours before measurements. The method of PWA and
PWV measurement has been described in detail elsewhere [21].
Briefly, PWA was done with the use of a validated general transfer
function [22]. The central pressure waveform was estimated based
on radial pressure waveform recordings, calibrated to a brachial
BP on the same arm. PWV was calculated based on the pulse
transit time divided by the travel distance. The PWV of the ‘aortic’
segment (aortic PWV) was recorded between the femoral and
carotid artery and the PWV of the ‘brachial’ segment (brachial
PWV) was recorded between the radial and carotid artery. When
determining the aortic PWV, the distance from the carotid
recording site to the suprasternal notch was subtracted from the
distance between the femoral recording site to the suprasternal
notch [23]. When determining the brachial PWV, the distance

from the carotid-suprasternal notch was subtracted from the
distance between the radial-suprasternal notch.
The quality demands of PWA and PWV were followed as
suggested by the manufacturer. This included visually acceptable
pulse-wave recordings with variations in pulse height, diastole and
pulse length #5% and the mean pulse height $80 mV as
expressed by a quality index (%) provided by the software. A
quality index $80% was accepted. In case of PWV, the time
difference between the ECG-signal and the signal from the
recording sites should have a SD #10% of the mean value. All
measurements of PWA and PWV were made in duplicate.
Management of hyperkalemia, excess rise in plasma creatinine and
hypotension have been described in details elsewhere [24].
BP Measurement and Clinical Chemistry
The brachial BP used for calibration of PWA and all other
brachial BPs were measured by use of a mercury sphygmoma￾nometer after at least 10 min of supine rest. The mean of the last
two out of three BP measurements were averaged and used for
analysis. Plasma creatinine was analyzed using reagents from
Vitros Chemistry 5.1, which are compatible with the IDMS
method (isotope dilution mass spectrometry). Plasma potassium

and other clinical chemistry parameters were measured using
standard methods.
51Cr-EDTA Clearance
Plasma clearance was calculated on the basis of plasma activity
in four blood samples drawn at 20-min intervals in the fourth hour
after injection [25]. In case of an expected GFR ,21 ml/min,
blood samples were drawn at 5 and 24 h after injection of 51Cr￾EDTA [26].
Arterial Hemodynamics
The pulse-wave is composed of an initial pulse-wave generated
by left ventricular ejection and its reflection from the periphery.
AIx@HR75 defined as the difference between the first and second
systolic peaks expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure
adjusted to a heart rate of 75 beats/min- was taken to represent
measures of arterial wave reflection [21]. Time to reflection (TR)
was defined as the total travel time of the pulse-wave to the
periphery and its return. Aortic PWV and brachial PWV are
measures of central and muscular arterial stiffness, respectively
[21] and were the pre-specified primary outcome measures. Pulse
pressure (PP) amplification was calculated as the ratio of brachial
PP/central PP [27]. Furthermore the following parameters were
registered: central and brachial systolic and diastolic BP, left
ventricular ejection duration (ED) and heart rate, which were the
secondary outcome measures in addition to AIx@HR75, TR and
PP-amplification.
Statistics
The sample size was calculated using a two-sided paired sample
t-test based on variations from previous data [28]. Twenty patients
were needed without previous treatment with RAS-blockade, with
previous treatment with ACE-I and with previous treatment with
ARB, respectively. This sample size would give a 99% chance of
detecting a difference of 1 m/s in aortic PWV and 80% in brachial
PWV with an alpha-level of 5%.
The two groups with or without prior RAS-blockade were then
randomized to four different treatment groups, which were
compared for differences in demographic characteristics by
analysis of variance. As no differences were found between groups
demographic data are shown for all patients together. The effects
of dual therapy and monotherapy on pulse-wave measurements
were analyzed by general linear models for repeated measure￾ments. As no differences were found between the four treatment
arms data were pooled and further analyzed in total. We aimed to
evaluate the effects of dual blockade on pulse-wave measurements
and therefore based the statistical analysis on the 57 patients who
completed dual blockade.
The effects of treatment on kidney function were evaluated by
use of Student’s t-test for dependent data. During the analyses of
repeated measurements, AIx@HR75, aortic PWV and brachial
PWV were adjusted for diastolic BP, gender and age. Furthermore
AIx@HR75 was adjusted for body-height, aortic PWV, TR and
ED in a similar way, like the PP-amplification ratio which was
adjusted for heart rate and body-height. Data are presented as
mean 6 standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Due to
skewed distribution urine albumin excretion and GFR were log￾transformed before analysis and the geometrical mean presented
with range in brackets. A P-value ,0.05 was considered
significant. Data were analyzed by use of a statistical computer
program (SPSS, version 17).
Results
Of the 67 randomized patients, 57 completed the trial. All
pulse-wave measurements were within our quality standard as
described in the methods section. The mean quality index was
9566%.

Pooling of Randomization Groups
No differences were found between randomization groups in
demographic data or baseline-values of pulse-wave measurements
and clinical chemistry parameters. No differences were detected
between treatment arms in the response of dual- versus mono￾RAS blockade. These data are therefore presented as pooled data
(table 1 and 2). Treatment with ACEI, ARB or the absence of
RAS-blocking treatment prior to the trial, did not influence the
response of dual RAS therapy versus mono-therapy for any of the
parameters.
Blood Pressures
The effects of mono- and dual RAS-blockade on pulse-wave
measurements and on kidney function are presented in table 2.
Brachial and central systolic BP (figure 2) decreased significantly
after start of combination treatment compared to monotherapy,
but no further change was seen in brachial and central diastolic
BP. Even though neither central nor brachial pulse pressure (PP)
achieved a significant reduction, a significant increase (P = 0.02) on
PP amplification was seen as illustrated in figure 3. This PP
amplification changed from 1.26 at study entry to 1.30 and 1.30
after 8 and 16 weeks of monotherapy respectively and increased to
1.34 after dual blockade without any influence of height or heart
rate.
Pulse-wave Velocity and Augmentation Index
A significant additive reduction was observed in aortic PWV of
0.3 m/s after combined treatment compared to monotherapy
corresponding to a difference of 3%. This was independent of
diastolic BP, age and gender. No significant change was detected
in brachial PWV (table 2). The heart rate adjusted augmentation
index.
(AIx@HR75) decreased significantly during dual blockade
versus monotherapy by 2% corresponding to a proportional
difference of 11%. This was independent of diastolic BP, age,
body-height and gender (figure 4). This change in AIx@HR75 was
related to the change in brachial PWV (P = 0.009) and not related
to changes in Time to reflection (TR), Ejection duration (ED) or
aortic PWV. No additive change was seen in TR, heart rate or ED
during dual-blockade.
Change in Clinical Chemistry Parameters
There was a further increase in p-creatinine and p-urea after
dual blockade compared to mono-blockade (table 2). No additive

effects were seen in p-potassium or urinary albumin excretion.
There was a significant reduction seen in glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) after dual blockade compared to baseline.
Tolerance and Other Medication
Thirty-three (49%) of the patients failed to tolerate full dual
blockade with enalapril and candesartan, and had to be given
lower doses of one or both of the drugs, or in 10 cases withdrawn
from the study [24]. Hence, 34 (51%) of the patients tolerated the
full dual blockade. Eight patients were withdrawn during mono￾therapy: 2 due to early technical difficulties with the pulse wave
measurements, 3 due to adverse reactions (unacceptable increase
in p-creatinine, intractable rise in p-potassium or night sweats),
one patient due to suspicion of malignancy early in the trial and 2
patients due to non-compliance. Two patients were withdrawn
during dual-therapy, both because of unacceptable increases in p￾creatinine. There were no differences in other antihypertensive
medicine between the mono-therapy and dual-therapy period.
Notably, the frequency of increasing or prescribing diuretics due to
hyperkalemia was the same for the two periods.
Transient hyperkalemia was frequently seen as previously
described [24], but was evenly distributed between the two
treatment regimens.
Discussion
The main finding of this study is the BP independent reduction
in arterial stiffness and pulse-wave reflection after combined
treatment with enalapril and candesartan compared to monother￾apy in patients with CKD. Furthermore pressure amplification
was increased during dual blockade compared to monotherapy.
Aortic PWV is considered a direct measure of arterial stiffness
[21] and is a strong independent predictor of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality and events in patients with ESRD [1,29]
and CKD [3]. We found a significant reduction in aortic PWV of
0.3 m/s during dual blockade independent of BP and corrected
for age and gender. In contrast no significant change was seen in
brachial PWV.
Pulse-waves are in most studies analyzed by three parameters:
central PP, central systolic BP and AIx [21] of which all have
shown independent predicting value of all-cause mortality in
ESRD [2,30]. In one study, for each increase of AIx of 10%, the
relative mortality risk was increased by 1,51 [2]. We found a
modest but significant reduction in the heart rate adjusted AIx
(AIx@HR75) of 2% after dual blockade compared to a reduction
during mono-blockade of 2% as well. Even after adjustment for
known determinants of AIx as diastolic BP, height, gender and age
[21,31] the reduction in AIx@HR75 was still significant. This
reduction in AIx@HR75 was related to the change in brachial

PWV even though this change did not achieve statistical
significance. This indicates that the reduction in the intensity of
wave-reflection was the principal mechanism of the change in
AIx@HR75 caused by a dilatation of medium-sized muscular
arteries and thereby a reduced brachial PWV. This relationship
has been emphasized by others [32].
Dual blockade significantly reduced brachial and central systolic
BP on average by 7 and 6 mmHg respectively on top of a decrease
during monotherapy of 11 and 12 mmHg respectively. A
significant increase in PP-amplification was seen (figure 3),
indicating a larger effect of dual blockade on central BP than on
brachial BP. This was despite the lack of proven significant
changes in central or brachial PP which were most likely caused by
a statistical error type II due to a limited number of patients. A
lower pressure amplification indicates a higher left ventricular
afterload because of higher central PP [33]. Thus the reduction of
PP amplification has prospectively been shown to be a strong
independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality in ESRD and
superior to central PP [30]. RAS-blocking agents have previously
been shown to cause increased pressure amplification. London et
al. reported an increase in amplification ratio from 1.0 to 1.13
after treatment with perindopril in patients with ESRD for 12
months [34]. In hypertensive patients Dhakam et al. found an
increase in PP amplification ratio from 1.38 to 1.42 after treatment
with eprosartan for 6 weeks [35]. In our study, 8 weeks of dual
blockade increased amplification ratio from 1.30 to 1.34.
No previous studies have been conducted on the effects of dual
blockade on pulse-wave measurements in CKD patients. A study
of 18 hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with
ACEI showed that add on valsartan reduced central BP more than
brachial BP. A significant reduction in AIx of 13% was found after
2 weeks [14]. In contrast, the same group observed no further
change in amplification in another study of 12 hypertensive
patients with normal renal function, comparing the effects of
valsartan, captopril and their combination [36]. Significant
reductions of both the central and brachial BP were found, but
to the same extent. Like us, they observed a BP independent
additive reduction of AIx and aortic PWV during combination
therapy compared to monotherapy. In a third study in 31
hypertensive patients with normal renal function, combining
valsartan and perindopril did also further reduce PWV but
without correction for BP [15].
Our patients had moderate to advanced CKD (stage 3–5) where
inhibition of RAS can be a challenge due to loss of kidney function
[37] and hyperkalemia [38]. Ten patients were withdrawn from
the study including two during the dual blockade period. Patients

were closely monitored and incidences such as hyperkalemia and
unacceptable increases in p-creatinine [39] were carefully man￾aged. Thus the full dose study medication of RAS blockers was
reduced in 42% of the patients. We have previously reported on
the feasibility of dual blockade in the first 47 patients of the study
[24].
Reduction of BP is known to reduce arterial stiffness [32]. The
fact that the decrease in aortic PWV and AIx@HR75 was
independent of BP suggests that the decrease in arterial stiffness
was caused by the direct effect of the drug on the vascular wall.
The common feature of ACEI and ARB appears to be their
dilating capacity on especially peripheral muscular arteries and
their ability to reduce wave-reflections, as expressed by AIx [32].
Combination of ACEI and ARB might produce a more complete
inhibition of RAS and enhance bradykinin accumulation resulting
in increased endothelial NO production. Furthermore ANGII is
known to cause cardiovascular remodelling and vascular hyper￾trophy, and it therefore seems likely that the action on vascular
wall includes chronic inverse remodelling of the small arteries
leading to improved viscoelastic properties. Because of the
relatively short period of treatment in our study, the additive
beneficial effects of dual blockade are probably caused by
functional changes, but due to the BP independent findings
structural changes cannot be excluded.
Study Limitations
The cross-over design allowed for comparisons within the same
patient. It would, however have been valuable with a control
group treated with ACEI/ARB monotherapy parallel to the dual
treatment period to rule out the time factor as a confounder. The
period of dual blockade was deliberately not randomized, because
of the crucial need for a cautious dose titration in each mono￾therapy before start of dual blockade in these vulnerable patients,
which necessitated the placement of the dual blockade treatment
period in the end of the trial.
There was no statistical difference between randomization arms,
which allowed for analysis of data pooled together. We cannot
though, exclude the possibility that inter-group differences did
exist, but were not found due to small numbers in each
randomization group. However, we consider, that by pooling
data more powerful results were achieved.
Conclusion
In CKD patients, combined RAS blockade with enalapril and
candesartan caused additive significant BP independent reductions
in aortic PWV and AIx@HR75 compared to mono-therapy.
Likewise, central systolic BP was reduced and PP-amplification
was increased during dualblockade. As these are all independent
predictors of cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients, the
beneficial effects of dual RAS blockade found in this study might
lead to a favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes in CKD
patients beyond that achieved by monotherapy.
