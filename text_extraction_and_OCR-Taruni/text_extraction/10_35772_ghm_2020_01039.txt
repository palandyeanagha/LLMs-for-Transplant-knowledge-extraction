COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (1). 
Global confirmed cases approached 4,445,000 patients 
with 302,493 deaths across over 187 countries as of May 
15, 2020 (2).
After the initial description in Wuhan, China (3,4), 
Italy was hit first in Europe and the impact has been 
rapidly enlarging with Lombardy and Veneto being the 
two most affected regions. Italian government ordered 
a nationwide lockdown effective from March 12, 2020. 
In early April, at the epidemic peak, there were more 
than 33,000 patients hospitalized including more than 
4,000 in Intensive Care Units (ICU). On May 15, the 
confirmed cases in Italy approached 224,000 patients 
(5th highest number worldwide), with more than 31,000 
deaths (3rd highest number worldwide) (2). Lombardy, 
the most affected district, suffered from a huge number 
of severely diseased people overwhelming its capability 
to absorb the need for care. That, despite Lombardy 
is one of the most efficient regions within the Italian 
NHS, recently ranked as the 9th among 195 healthcare 
systems worldwide (5). In this context, a high number of 
contagions among the hospital health care professionals 
(HcP) has been reported, with over 10,000 healthcare 
professional infected and more than 100 physicians died 
of the disease (6). On March 9, the Lombardy lockdown 
was established, and on March 12 the entire country 
underwent lockdown, almost completely released on 
May 18.
Non-urgent, non-cancer procedures were stopped 
to reallocate nurses and anesthesiologists to face the 
COVID-19 emergency. This measure freed ventilators 
for patients with COVID-19 and converted surgical 
theatres into additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds as 
needed.
Most surgical departments were closed and converted 
to medical wards specifically dedicated to COVID-19 
patients. More and more surgeons were also requested 
to help medical personnel in the COVID-19 elective 
and emergency wards, an absolutely unpredictable 
event. Figure 1 shows the timeline of the progressive 
involvement by COVID-19 patients of 36 hospitals 
referrals for surgical oncology in Italy (7).
In this setting, only emergency, and elective 
oncological procedures were allowed with obvious 
limitations in terms of numbers of operable cases. 
Exceeding half of the surgical departments largely 
decreased their own activity, doubling in most cases the

Abstract: After the initial description of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, Italy was hit first in Europe and the impact has 
been rapidly enlarging. In early April 2020, at the epidemic peak, there were more than 33,000 patients hospitalized 
including more than 4,000 in Intensive Care Units (ICU). On May 15, the confirmed cases in Italy approached 224,000 
patients (5th highest number worldwide), with more than 31,000 deaths (3rd highest number worldwide). Non-urgent, 
non-cancer procedures were stopped to reallocate nurses and anesthetists to face the COVID-19 emergency. The 
timeline of the progressive involvement by COVID-19 patients of 36 hospitals referrals for surgical oncology in Italy 
was shown in this article. Only emergency, and elective oncological procedures were allowed with obvious limitations 
in terms of numbers of operable cases. Criteria for prioritizing oncologic patients waiting for surgery were released 
by each region, mainly issuing main factors for decision making, biological aggressiveness or symptomatic disease, 
the interval from the latest treatment, and the risk of un-resectability if delayed. However, the lack of facilities mostly 
influenced the decision or not to proceed. The risk of operating on oncological patients with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 
syndrome is real, and a preoperative flowchart for ruling out this occurrence has been promoted. In our center, the day 
before surgery, chest CT and swab testing have been introduced, and a similar behavior has been recommended prior to 
patients' discharge. The care of patients addressed for surgical oncology should be featured by dedicated paths to secure 
proper and prompt disease management.

waiting lists (7). 
Criteria for prioritizing oncologic patients waiting 
for surgery were released by each region, mainly 
issuing main factors for decision making, biological 
aggressiveness or symptomatic disease, the interval from 
the latest treatment, and the risk of un-resectability if 
delayed. However, the lack of facilities mostly influenced 
the decision or not to proceed. The constrain of ICU 
beds, the lack of expert anesthesiologists emphasized by 
the need of interventions just for patients with advanced 
diseases, the reductions of other facilities, as endoscopy, 
interventional radiology, and radiotherapy hampered 
the clinically and biologically based prioritization. 
NHS authorities activated oncological hub-and-spoke 
programs identifying as Hubs, those hospitals recognized 
as referrals in surgical oncology, and preferentially not 
heavily involved in caring for SARS-CoV-2 positive 
patients. Provided criteria for prioritizing the patients 
essentially based on tumor biology, tumor burden, 
therapeutic alternatives, and American Society of 
Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score risk (8), the Hubs should 
have served for caring for those patients who could not 
be operated on in those hospitals mostly impacted by the 
COVID-19 (spoke). Theoretically, wisdom, it partially 
failed for those Hub centers which resulted also as 
COVID-19 hospitals, then suffering similar conditions 
to those affected institutions in need of sharing their 
oncological waiting lists (7). Conversely, the centers, 
which were able to address the request to be Oncological 
Hubs were the Cancer Centers without emergency 
departments. For sure, Cancer Centers physically 
separated from emergency and infectious disease 
departments, should be implemented to preserve surgical 
oncology activity even in conditions similar to that.
The risk of operating on oncological patients with 
ongoing COVID-19 syndrome is real, a preoperative 
flowchart for ruling out this occurrence have been 
promoted. In our center, the day before surgery, chest 
CT and swab testing have been introduced, and a similar 
behavior has been recommended prior to patients' 
discharge.
The risk of healthcare professionals represents 
something to be considered too. The WHO recommends 
minimizing the need for personal protective equipment 
(PPE), and in doing that demands to rationalize its 
distribution (9). However, providing PPE to the 
healthcare professionals is a priority since in-hospital 
transmission could deeply undermine their ability to 
address the request of a system already under significant 
strain. One third of the departments of surgical oncology 
in Italy suffered surgeons becoming SARS-CoV-2 
positive (7), which significantly impacted the working 
power of the teams. Providing extensive testing for 
healthcare professionals, and warranting adequate 
availability of PPE, is also crucial for protecting those 
patients affected from other problems, and particularly 
those oncologic. This issue still remains to be addressed 
in many institutions. Particular attention should be also 
paid to the safety assessment in the operating room as 
emphasized by many scientific societies (10,11).
Hospital layouts enabling respect for social distance, 
with paths for patients with infectious disease, and 
those for oncological patients clearly separated, should 
be the next target. Existing modalities of telemedicine 
would help and should probably be implemented to 
overcome for now and for the future the problem of 
travelling for many patients. Similarly, it should be done 
for multidisciplinary meetings, particularly involving 
multiple centers.
In conclusion, the adaptation of the system did not 
work adequately. As partial justification, it is worthwhile 
to be mentioned that the COVID-19 outbreak was 
really overwhelming. Indeed, Italy has been the country 
where the COVID-19 outbreak started in the Western 
world. At that time, it was still an epidemic, and the 
country did not have benefit of the time needed to 
better organize an efficient reaction. An option, which 
was conversely suitable for the other nations despite 
most of them anyhow heavily suffered the epidemic, 
which meanwhile became a pandemic (12). Preemptive 
measures such as the acquisition of PPE, and swab test 
kits, and support to the general practitioners, should 
have been implemented once the risk of diffusion was 
advisable. Strengthening the healthcare system within 
the territory would have been probably helpful in better 
monitoring the contagion searching for the asymptomatic 
carrier (13), and trying to prevent complications by 
improved patients' care. Missing all of that we have 
had to sustain an overwhelming strain for the hospital's 
network, otherwise well established and internationally 
recognized: its reaction anyhow allowed to overcome the 
pandemic peak. This dramatic experience should convey 
helpful insights for the future. Particularly now, since the 
outbreak is decrementing, testing the population, treating 
the patients, and tracking the contagion paths are crucial
