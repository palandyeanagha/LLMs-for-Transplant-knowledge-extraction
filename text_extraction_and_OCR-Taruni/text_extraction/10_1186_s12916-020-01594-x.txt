The role of testosterone in chronic kidney
disease and kidney function in men and
women: a bi-directional Mendelian
randomization study in the UK Biobank
Jie V. Zhao1* and C. Mary Schooling1,2
Abstract
Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has an apparent sex disparity, with a more rapid progress in men than
in women. Whether the well-established sex-specific evolutionary biology trade-off between reproduction and
longevity might inform CKD has not previously been considered. Relevant evidence from randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) is not available.
Methods: We used a bi-directional Mendelian randomization study to obtain unconfounded estimates using the
UK Biobank. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that strongly (p value < 5 × 10−8
) predicted testosterone in a
sex-specific manner were applied to 179,916 white British men (6016 CKD cases) and 212,079 white British women
(5958 CKD cases) to obtain sex-specific associations with CKD, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR). We also used multivariable MR to control for sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). For validation, we
similarly examined their role in hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). We also assessed the
role of kidney function in serum testosterone, by applying eGFR-related SNPs to testosterone in the UK Biobank.
Results: Genetically predicted testosterone was associated with CKD in men (odds ratio (OR) for bioavailable
testosterone 1.17 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.33) based on 125 SNPs but not in
women (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14 for total testosterone) based on 254 SNPs. Multivariable MR allowing for SHBG
showed consistent patterns. Genetically predicted bioavailable testosterone in men and women and genetically
predicted total testosterone in women increased hemoglobin and lowered HDL-c, as seen in RCTs. Genetically
predicted eGFR was not related to serum testosterone in men or in women.
Conclusions: Genetically predicted testosterone was associated with CKD and worse kidney function in men, whilst
not affected by kidney function. Identifying drivers of testosterone and the underlying pathways could provide new
insights into CKD prevention and treatment.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major burden
of morbidity and mortality globally, affecting 10% of the
population worldwide [1]. Renal replacement therapy (dia￾lysis or kidney transplantation), which is the treatment to
enable survival during end-stage renal disease, has become
the leading cost in health care systems in developed coun￾tries [2]. Notably, CKD has an apparent disparity in men
and women [3]. Specifically, kidney function declines fas￾ter in men than in women, and the mortality rate is higher
in men at all levels of pre-dialysis CKD [3]. Understanding
the reasons underlying men’s disadvantage may provide
new clues about etiology, with relevance to identification
of new modifiable targets in primary care and develop￾ment of clinical treatment for CKD. It may also provide
information that can be used to address the sexual dispar￾ity in life expectancy.
Accumulating evidence suggests androgens may play a
key role in differences in longevity by sex [4]. From the
perspective of evolutionary biology, growth and
reproduction trade off against longevity, with men and
women having different investments in these trade-offs
and as a result have different vulnerabilities to disease
[4–6]. Correspondingly, hypothalamic-pituitary axis dys￾function is closely related to infertility and to CKD [7,
8], supporting a role of reproductive factors in CKD.
Animal experiments have repeatedly shown that testos￾terone damages renal function [9, 10]. For example,
in vitro experiments show testosterone induced renal
tubular epithelial cell death in a dose-response manner
[10]. Correspondingly, castration in males increases
renal clearance [11], lowers proteinuria, and protects
against glomerular injury assessed from renal morph￾ology [11, 12]. Nevertheless, evidence, especially experi￾mental evidence, in humans is limited. A clinical case
report showed testosterone therapy induced renal im￾pairment [13]. A randomized controlled trial in 48 men
showed 6-month testosterone treatment lowered esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [14]. In contrast,
some observational studies have found higher testoster￾one associated with lower mortality in CKD patients
[15] and higher eGFR [16]. These observed associations
in patients are difficult to interpret because observa￾tional studies, essentially of survivors, are open to selec￾tion bias [17]. No large-scale RCT has ever been
implemented to assess the long-term effect of testoster￾one on CKD. Moreover, no study has specifically exam￾ined the sex-specific role of testosterone in CKD and
kidney function.
In this situation where a large RCT is not available,
using naturally occurring testosterone-related genetic
variants as proxies of exposure, i.e., a Mendelian
randomization (MR) study design, enables us to obtain
unconfounded associations without any potentially
harmful interventions. Genetic variants resulting in life￾long differences in endogenous exposures are unlikely to
be associated with socioeconomic position or other con￾founders as they are determined at conception [18]. In
this study, for the first time, we examined the association
of genetically predicted testosterone with CKD events
and kidney function using an MR study in the UK Bio￾bank. For validation of the genetic instrument, we simi￾larly examined the effect of genetically predicted
testosterone on hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL)-cholesterol, because meta-analysis of RCTs has
clearly shown testosterone increases hemoglobin and
lowers HDL-cholesterol [19]. As serum testosterone may
also be affected by kidney function [20], we used a bi￾directional MR to examine the effect of genetically pre￾dicted eGFR on serum testosterone.
Methods
Study design
We used univariable MR, as well as multivariable MR, to
control for pleiotropic effects of SHBG where necessary
[21]. We used a one-sample MR study to examine the
role of genetically predicted testosterone in CKD and
kidney function (indicated by albuminuria and eGFR),
by applying testosterone-related, genome-wide signifi￾cant SNPs in univariable MR and additionally including
SHBG-related, genome-wide significant SNPs in multi￾variable MR, to the individual level outcome data in
men and women separately in the UK Biobank, by far
the largest cohort in Europeans [22]. For validation, we
assessed the associations of genetically predicted testos￾terone with hemoglobin and HDL-cholesterol; a finding
consistent with well-established effects in RCTs provides
some validation of the genetic instrument. We also
tested the role of genetically predicted eGFR in serum
testosterone to check for the reverse association.
The role of testosterone in CKD and eGFR
Data source
The genetic predictors for testosterone and their associa￾tions with CKD and kidney function were both obtained
from the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a large, on￾going, prospective cohort study, with median follow up
time of 11.1 years [22]. The UK Biobank recruited 502,
713 people (aged 40–69 years, mean age 56.5 years,
45.6% men) from 2006 to 2010 from England, Scotland,
and Wales; 94% were of self-reported European ancestry.
Genetic predictors for testosterone
MR is based on three assumptions, i.e., the genetic vari￾ants, specifically here single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), are strongly related to the exposure (relevance),
are not associated with confounders of the exposure￾outcome relation (independence), and only influence the
Zhao and Schooling BMC Medicine (2020) 18:122 Page 2 of 10

outcome via the exposure (exclusion-restriction) [23].
To meet these assumptions, we used genome-wide sig￾nificant (p < 5 × 10−8
) SNPs. The genetic instruments
were obtained from the largest, sex-specific genome￾wide association study (GWAS) conducted in the UK
Biobank (178,782 white British men and 230,454 white
British women) and replicated in three independent
studies (CHARGE Consortium, Twins UK, and EPIC￾Norfolk) [21]. The GWAS provided 125 independent
SNPs (r
2 < 0.05) for bioavailable testosterone in men and
254 independent SNPs for testosterone in women, with
minor allele frequency > 0.1%, imputation quality score >
0.5, and little genetic correlation with SHBG (− 0.05 in
men and − 0.06 in women) [21]. We checked for the
Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium (HWE) and dropped any
SNP with HWE p value < 10−50 [24]. The GWAS also
provided 231 independent SNPs for total testosterone in
men and 180 independent SNPs for bioavailable testos￾terone in women [21], which are highly correlated with
SHBG [21]. As such, multivariable MR controlling for
SHBG may have the greatest validity for these instru￾ments, but for comprehensiveness, we also presented re￾sults of univariable MR for comparison.
To satisfy the assumption of independence, we
checked for their association with potential confounders,
including Townsend index, smoking, alcohol drinking,
and physical activity in the UK Biobank summary statis￾tics. We dropped SNPs associated with any of these po￾tential confounders at genome-wide significance (p <5×
10−8
). We also checked in PhenoScanner (www.phenos￾canner.medschl.cam.ac.uk), a platform with comprehen￾sive information on the associations of genotype and
phenotype, to see whether these SNPs were associated
with the potential confounders, and dropped SNP(s) as￾sociated with any of these potential confounders at
genome-wide significance.
Genetic predictors for multivariable MR
Multivariable MR controlling for SHBG used genetic
predictors for the exposure (bioavailable testosterone or
total testosterone) and SHBG. The genetic predictors for
testosterone were as used in univariable MR. The gen￾etic predictors for SHBG were provided by the GWAS
in the UK Biobank, with 357 SNPs in men and 359 SNPs
in women [21]. After combining the genetic predictors
for an exposure and SHBG, we dropped overlapping
SNPs, correlated SNPs (r
2 > 0.05), and SNPs whose cor￾relations with other SNPs not available in MR-Base or
LDlink (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/). The remaining SNPs
were used for multivariable MR.
Genetic associations with CKD and kidney function
The genetic associations with CKD were obtained using
individual-level, de-identified information from the UK
Biobank (under application #42468). CKD events in￾cluded mortality, morbidity, and self-reported chronic
renal failure (ICD10-code: N18, ICD9-code: 5859, and
self-report code: 1192); indications of renal replacement
therapy (ICD-10 code Z99.2 (dependence on renal dialy￾sis), Z94.0 (kidney transplant status), and Z49 (encoun￾ter for care involving renal dialysis)), identified based on
a nurse-led interview at recruitment; record linkage to
all health service encounters; deaths in the ongoing
follow-up [22]; and eGFR, calculated based on the CKD￾EPI formula using serum creatinine [25], less than 60
ml/min per 1.73 m2
. Other outcomes included albumin￾uria and eGFR calculated based on the CKD-EPI for￾mula using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) [25] and using
both creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr_cys) [26].
In the UK Biobank, genotyping was assessed using two
very similar arrays, i.e., the UK BiLEVE array and UK
Biobank Axiom array. To control for population stratifi￾cation, we restricted our analysis to participants with
white British ancestry based on self-report and genetic
quality control information. For quality control, we ex￾cluded participants with inconsistent self-reported and
genotyped sex, or excess relatedness (more than 10 puta￾tive third-degree relatives) or abnormal sex chromo￾somes (such as XXY), or poor-quality genotyping
(heterozygosity or missing rate > 1.5%). After quality
control, we identified 179,916 white British men (6016
CKD cases) and 212,079 white British women (5958
CKD cases) updated till December 2019. Albuminuria
was identified based on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(UACR) > 30 mg/g [27], where urine microalbumin was
measured using an immune-turbidimetric assay, and
urine creatinine was measured using an enzymatic assay
(http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/showcase/docs/
urine_assay.pdf); participants with microalbumin lower
than the detection limit were considered to be free from
albuminuria. We identified 8845 men and 8275 women
with albuminuria. Logistic regression was used to obtain
the association of each SNP with CKD and albuminuria,
and linear regression was used for eGFR. We controlled
for age, sex, 20 principal components, assay array, body
mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP). BMI and blood pressure
were controlled for because they are risk factors in com￾mon for various chronic diseases such as CKD and car￾diovascular disease (CVD) [28, 29]; controlling for the
common risk factors may partly address selection bias
from competing risk from other diseases before recruit￾ment [29, 30].
Genetic associations with hemoglobin and HDL-cholesterol
For validation, we examined the association of genetically
predicted testosterone with hemoglobin and HDL￾cholesterol as positive controls. The sex-specific associations
Zhao and Schooling BMC Medicine (2020) 18:122 Page 3 of 10

of each SNP with hemoglobin and HDL-cholesterol were ob￾tained from the UK Biobank summary statistics provided by
Neale Lab (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/), using linear
regression adjusted for age, age2
, and 20 principal compo￾nents in the UK Biobank.
The role of kidney function in serum testosterone
Genetic predictors for eGFR
To meet the MR assumptions, we used genetic predic￾tors reaching genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8
) in
the recent GWAS meta-analysis in CKDGen [31]. We
selected independent SNPs (r
2 < 0.01) predicting eGFR
using the “clumping” function of MR-Base. Given it is a
two-sample MR, we also checked for palindromic SNPs
(i.e., SNPs with alleles (A/T and C/G) that pair with each
other) and aligned on effect allele frequency. We
dropped palindromic SNPs if the minor allele frequency
was close to 0.50, such as 0.48 to 0.52, which are difficult
to align unequivocally.
Genetic association with serum testosterone
We obtained the association of each eGFR-related SNP
with serum testosterone from the UK Biobank summary
statistics, provided by Neale Lab (http://www.nealelab.is/
uk-biobank/), in 167,020 white British men and 194,174
women, adjusted for age, age2
, and 20 principal compo￾nents. If the SNPs predicting eGFR were not in the UK
Biobank, proxy SNPs (r
2 ≥ 0.8), identified from the
LDlink (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/), were used.
Statistical analysis for MR estimates using univariable MR
MR estimates were derived from the Wald estimates
(genetic association with outcome divided by the genetic
association with the exposure), i.e., genetic association
with CKD, albuminuria, or eGFR divided by the genetic
association with testosterone when assessing the renal
effect of testosterone, and genetic association with tes￾tosterone divided by the genetic association with eGFR
when assessing the role of kidney function in testoster￾one. We obtained the Wald estimate for each SNP and
then meta-analyzed them using inverse variance weight￾ing (IVW) with multiplicative random effects. To exam￾ine whether the MR estimates were larger in men than
in women, we calculated the p value for the differences
in sex-specific estimates (log odds ratios for CKD and al￾buminuria, and beta-coefficients for eGFR), where we
used a well-established formula to calculate the z-statis￾tic, and then obtained the one-tailed p value [32].
In sensitivity analysis, we used other statistical
methods, specifically a weighted median [33] and Men￾delian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier
(MR-PRESSO) [34]. The weighted median estimate is ro￾bust to invalid instruments and able to provide consist￾ent estimation even when up to 50% of the weight is
from invalid SNPs [33]. MR-PRESSO is able to identify
outliers with potential horizontal pleiotropy amongst
multiple genetic variants and provide a corrected esti￾mate after removing these outliers [34]. If MR-PRESSO
identified outlier(s), we used the corrected estimates
from MR-PRESSO instead of IVW in the main analysis.
Power calculations were conducted where the sample
size needed for MR is approximately the sample size for
the conventional observational study divided by the vari￾ance in the exposure explained by the SNPs [35]. Specif￾ically, the variance explained by each SNP was
calculated using beta2 × 2 × minor allele frequency
(MAF) × (1 − MAF), where beta is the standardized beta
coefficient for the effect allele and MAF is the minor al￾lele frequency [36]. For CKD events, the required sample
size was calculated based on the log odds ratio, the ratio
of cases to non-cases, and the variance explained by the
SNPs [37]. For eGFR, the continuous outcome, it was
calculated based on the effect size and the variance ex￾plained by the SNPs [35].
Statistical analysis for MR estimates using multivariable
MR
Multivariable MR is an extension of conventional uni￾variable MR. It takes advantage of pleiotropic SNPs pre￾dicting two or more exposures and can be used to
estimate the effect of one exposure after controlling for
the other exposure(s) [38], here the effect of testosterone
on CKD and kidney function after controlling for SHBG.
In multivariable MR, we used MR Egger to detect
whether the genetic predictors were acting other than
via testosterone or SHBG (directional pleiotropy) indi￾cated by a non-zero intercept [39], in which case we
used multivariable MR Egger estimates in the main
analysis.
All statistical analyses were conducted using R version
3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria), the “clumping” function of MR-Base, and the R
package “MendelianRandomization.”

Results
The role of testosterone in CKD and kidney function
We used the previously published 125 genome-wide sig￾nificant SNPs for bioavailable testosterone in men and
254 SNPs for total testosterone in women. No SNP vio￾lated HWE. One SNP in men and 2 SNPs in women
were related to alcohol drinking. Given the unclear
causal role of alcohol in CKD, we kept these SNPs in the
main analysis but excluded them in the sensitivity ana￾lysis. Of these SNPs, 6 SNPs in men and 2 SNPs in
women were not available in the summary statistics
from Neale Lab (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/),
nor were their proxies, so 119 SNPs in men and 252
SNPs in women were used for hemoglobin and HDL￾cholesterol, whereas all SNPs were used for CKD and
kidney function. Similarly, we used the previously pub￾lished 231 genome-wide significant SNPs for total tes￾tosterone in men and the 180 SNPs for bioavailable
testosterone in women. All SNPs were used for CKD
and kidney function; 224 SNPs in men and 176 SNPs in
women were used for hemoglobin and HDL-cholesterol.
In multivariable MR for bioavailable testosterone con￾trolling for SHBG in men, there were 125 SNPs for bio￾available testosterone and 357 SNPs for SHBG (in total
482 SNPs). After excluding 3 duplicate SNPs, 8 corre￾lated SNPs, and 7 SNPs with unclear correlation infor￾mation, 464 SNPs remained and were used. In women,
there were 180 SNPs for bioavailable testosterone and
359 SNPs for SHBG (in total 539 SNPs). After excluding
26 duplicate SNPs, 47 correlated SNPs, and 3 SNPs with
unclear correlation information, 463 SNPs remained. In
multivariable MR for total testosterone controlling for
SHBG in men, there were 231 SNPs for total testoster￾one and 357 SNPs for SHBG (in total 588 SNPs). After
excluding 39 duplicate SNPs, 87 correlated SNPs, and 2
SNPs with unclear correlation information, 460 SNPs
remained and were used. In women, there were 254
SNPs for total testosterone and 359 SNPs for SHBG (in
total 613 SNPs). After excluding 2 duplicate SNPs, 29
correlated SNPs, and 1 SNPs with unclear correlation in￾formation, 581 SNPs remained.
Using univariable MR, genetically predicted bioavail￾able testosterone was associated with higher risk of CKD
and albuminuria, and lower eGFRcr and eGFRcr_cys in
men, but had null associations in women (Table 1),
whilst neither bioavailable nor total testosterone was re￾lated to CKD or kidney function in women (Table 1 and
Additional file 1: Table S1). The difference by sex was
significant for CKD and albuminuria (p values for sex
difference 0.04 and 0.01, respectively) as well as for
eGFR (p values for sex difference less than 1 × 10−5 for
both eGFRcr and eGFRcr_cys). The associations were
robust to different methods (Additional file 1: Table S2)
and to excluding SNPs related to alcohol drinking (Add￾itional file 1: Table S3). Similar patterns of associations
were found in multivariable MR (Table 2). Multivariable
MR Egger did not indicate directional pleiotropy except
for bioavailable testosterone and CKD in women (Add￾itional file 1: Table S4). At an approximate R2 of 0.056
in men and of 0.085 in women, the UK Biobank has 0.8
power to detect an odds ratio (OR) of about 1.17 for
CKD and 1.14 for albuminuria per one standard devi￾ation increase in testosterone in men and an OR of
about 1.14 for CKD and 1.12 for albuminuria in women
[37], as well as an effect size of about 0.03 standard devi￾ations for eGFR in men and of 0.02 in women [35]. Gen￾etically predicted bioavailable testosterone in men and
women, as well as genetically predicted total testoster￾one in women, showed the associations expected from
meta-analysis of RCTs [19], i.e., a positive association
with hemoglobin and inverse association with HDL￾cholesterol (Table 3), whist total testosterone in men
was related to higher HDL-cholesterol in univariable
MR but was as expected, related to lower HDL￾cholesterol, in multivariable MR controlling for SHBG
(Additional file 1: Table S5).
The role of kidney function in testosterone
There were 264 SNPs for eGFR in the GWAS meta￾analysis [31]. Of the 264 SNPs, 228 were uncorrelated.
After excluding 1 SNP not available for genetic associ￾ation with testosterone and 4 SNPs that are palindromic
with minor allele frequency close to 0.5, 223 SNPs were
used (Additional file 1: Table S6). Genetically predicted
eGFR was not related to testosterone in men or women
(Table 4). The associations were robust to different ana￾lysis methods (Table 4).
Discussion
In an MR study using univariable and multivariable MR,
our study for the first time suggests testosterone affects
CKD and kidney function in a sex-specific way. Testos￾terone might be an underlying cause of CKD in men but
not in women. Meanwhile, genetically predicted kidney
function did not affect serum testosterone. Our finding
may be relevant to the sex disparity in CKD and kidney
function, consistent with the sex-specific role of testos￾terone in CVD [40], and with expectations from evolu￾tionary biology [4–6].
Our findings did not corroborate a beneficial associ￾ation of testosterone with kidney function sometimes
seen in observational studies [15, 16], possibly due to
poor health lowering both testosterone and kidney func￾tion [41, 42]. However, dietary factors, such as a high
Zhao and Schooling BMC Medicine (2020) 18:122 Page 5 of 10

protein diet, which boost testosterone in men [43], in￾crease CKD. In contrast, some medications lowering tes￾tosterone show a benefit for kidney function. For
example, statins lower testosterone [44] and can slow
down the progression of CKD [45]. Although the bene￾fits may be due to lipid lowering, recent MR studies do
not support a role of LDL-cholesterol in CKD [46]. Our
findings are also consistent with changing disease pat￾terns with economic development. Improvements in
living conditions that enable higher levels of testosterone
[47], with corresponding effects on kidney function, may
be relevant to the rising rates of CKD that emerge with
economic development, such as in China [1].
To our knowledge, this MR study is the first to exam￾ine the role of testosterone in CKD and kidney function.
Despite the novelty, our study has several limitations.
First, MR relies on three assumptions, i.e., relevance, in￾dependence, and exclusion-restriction [23]. To satisfy

these assumptions, we used genetic variants from the
largest sex-specific published GWAS of testosterone
based on the UK Biobank and with replication in three
independent studies [21]. We also checked the
randomization from their associations with potential
confounders, such as socioeconomic position and life￾style. To address the assumption of exclusion￾restriction, we tested and corrected for potential plei￾otropy using MR-PRESSO. We also used multivariable
MR to control for pleiotropic associations with SHBG.
Second, measurement error might exist in the classifica￾tion of CKD or the single time-point assay of testoster￾one. However, any measurement error should be non￾differential, thus bias toward a null association, which
should not affect the directions of associations. Third,
our study could be affected by survivor bias [30] and by
competing risk, i.e., by an event whose occurrence pre￾cludes the occurrence of CKD [29]. For example, if tes￾tosterone leads to death from ischemic heart disease at
74 years [48], death from CKD which usually occurs at
85 years will not be observed [49]. As such, the potential
harm for CKD will be underestimated due to competing
events. To control for the bias arising from competing
risk, we adjusted for common causes of CKD and CVD
[29], specifically BMI, smoking, and blood pressure.
Fourth, the participants in the UK Biobank are healthier
than the general population [50], and the majority do
not suffer from CKD, so the estimates may not be ap￾plicable to CKD patients; however, the directions of as￾sociations should be consistent. Fifth, the associations in
Europeans may not apply to other populations, such as
Asians. However, causal effects should be consistent
across settings, for example the effect on HDL￾cholesterol was also reported in our previous MR study
in Chinese [51]. Nevertheless, the effect size might vary
by population according to testosterone levels; as such,
replication in Asians would be worthwhile. Sixth, the
genetic effects might be buffered by compensatory pro￾cesses or feedback mechanisms. Such compensation
would be expected to mitigate the genetic effects, thus
biasing toward the null. As such, the estimates for CKD
and kidney function might be underestimated. Finally,
the wide age range in the UK Biobank participants may
increase the variation in testosterone levels. However,
this will only lower the precision of the testosterone
GWAS and MR estimates, rather than affect the direc￾tions of association.
Despite the consistency with evolutionary biology [4–
6], the known sex disparity [3], and evidence from ani￾mal experiments [9, 10], these novel findings need to be
interpreted cautiously. First, the association with CKD
needs to be replicated in a larger sample with more
power. Second, due to the limited number with follow￾up measures of kidney function, we used baseline rather
than decline in kidney function. It would be valuable to
assess the role of testosterone in CKD progression, spe￾cifically the relevance to decline in kidney function,
when sufficient follow-up data in the UK Biobank and
suitable analytic techniques are available [52]. Third, the
role of endogenous testosterone might be different from
the role of testosterone supplementation or other life￾style factors that modulate testosterone. However, the
findings for hemoglobin and HDL-cholesterol in MR
showed consistency with meta-analysis of RCTs [19].

Moreover, MR estimates lifetime effects rather than the
effects of a short-term exposure. As such, the effect on
CKD and kidney function might not be comparable to
the acute renal effect of testosterone supplementation,
although the use of testosterone gel lowers eGFR in
RCT [14]. Finally, the underlying pathways from testos￾terone to kidney function remain to be clarified. The in￾verse association with eGFRcr might be due to or partly
due to testosterone increasing muscle mass and thereby
increasing serum creatinine. However, the inverse asso￾ciation remained for eGFRcr_cys. The similar pattern of
associations for CKD and albuminuria also provides con￾sistent evidence concerning the renal effects of testoster￾one. The effect size is small and might not be clinically
significant; however, an MR study is more useful in de￾termining the direction of causation than the magnitude
of an effect size [53]. Moreover, a small effect size may
be highly relevant at the population level [54]. Several
mechanisms might underlie the renal effects of testoster￾one, including an effect on cellular apoptosis that may
impact renal disease progression, an effect on glomerular
matrix accumulation, an influence on the synthesis and
activity of several cytokines and vasoactive agents, an
interaction with the renin-angiotensin system [55], an
increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species [55,
56], and a pro-inflammatory effect in the kidney [57]. In￾flammation and immune function may underlie the
pathology of CKD [58], and testosterone is known to be
immunomodulatory [59]. In a clinical case report, testos￾terone directly modulated kidney perfusion [13], but the
specific pathway is unclear. Clarifying these pathways,
especially as regards any sex differences in the response
to testosterone, such as immune function [59], would be
valuable.
From the perspective of clinical and public health
practice, our findings suggest that testosterone and
drivers of testosterone are potential targets for lowering
the burden of kidney disease in men rather than in
women, consistent with the dominant role of testoster￾one in men’s reproduction and health [4]. Medications
or lifestyle factors that modulate testosterone might be
effective for the prevention and treatment of CKD and
may be expected to play a sex-specific effect. As such,
our study highlights the importance of considering sex￾specific causes and treatments for CKD and raises the
question as to whether any causes of CKD specific to
women exist. Exploration of such factors and the under￾lying pathways would give insights to the re-positioning
of existing drugs, new drug development, and lifestyle
recommendations.
Conclusions
Genetically predicted testosterone was associated with
CKD and unfavorable kidney function in men, which
might contribute to the sex disparity in CKD. Serum tes￾tosterone was not affected by kidney function. Clarifying
the underlying pathways could provide new insights for
prevention and treatment strategies in both men and
women. Replication in other studies, especially in under￾studied populations, is needed.
