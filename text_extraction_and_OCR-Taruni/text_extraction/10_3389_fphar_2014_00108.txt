Introduction: The use of opioids has been increasing in operating room and intensive
care unit to provide perioperative analgesia as well as stable hemodynamics. However,
many authors have suggested that the use of opioids is associated with the expression of
acute opioid tolerance (AOT) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) in experimental studies
and clinical observations in dose and/or time dependent exposure even when used within
the clinically accepted doses. Recently, remifentanil has been used for pain management
during anesthesia as well as in the intensive care units because of its rapid onset and offset.
Objectives: Search of the available literature to assess remifentanil AOT and OIH based
on available published data.
Methods: We reviewed articles analyzing remifentanil AOT and OIH, and focused our
literature search on evidence based information. Experimental and clinical studies were
identified using electronic searches of Medline (PubMed, Ovid, Springer, and Elsevier,
ClinicalKey).
Results: Our results showed that the development of remifentanil AOT and OIH is a
clinically significant phenomenon requiring further research.
Discussions and Conclusions: AOT – defined as an increase in the required opioid dose to
maintain adequate analgesia, and OIH – defined as decreased pain threshold after chronic
opioid treatment, should be suspected with any unexplained pain report unassociated with
the disease progression. The clinical significance of these findings was evaluated taking
into account multiple methodological issues including the dose and duration of opioids
administration, the different infusion mode, the co-administrated anesthetic drug’s effect,
method assessing pain sensitivity, and the repetitive and potentially tissue damaging nature
of the stimuli used to determine the threshold during opioid infusion. Future studies need
to investigate the contribution of remifentanil induced hyperalgesia to chronic pain and the
role of pharmacological modulation to reverse this process.

INTRODUCTION
Even though remifentanil increases analgesia and respiratory
depression in a dose-dependent manner (Hughes et al., 1992;
Egan et al., 1993; Glass et al., 1993; Westmoreland et al., 1993;
Kapila et al., 1995), these effects disappear rapidly after discon￾tinuing administration of the drug because of the extremely
short elimination half-life (9.5 ± 4 min). Especially, remifentanil
has the shortest context-sensitive half-time and terminal elim￾ination half-life among other opioid after 3-h infusion (Kapila
et al., 1995). Therefore, remifentanil can be given in high doses
throughout surgery without the risk of delayed postoperative
recovery or respiratory depression. Because of its pharmacody￾namic and pharmacokinetic effects, remifentanil has been used in
clinical anesthesia as an induction and maintenance agent, and
postoperative pain management in the intensive care units.
Most of the studies conducted with remifentanil showed car￾diovascular responses during perioperative manipulations. They
recommended a bolus injection of remifentanil of 1 μg/kg as
more effective dose in reducing the pressor response during
laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (McAtamney et al., 1998;
O’Hare et al., 1999). However, while the cardiovascular responses
reaches a peak 1–2 min after laryngoscopy and intubation, and
usually subsides within 5–6 min (Singh et al., 1995), the context￾sensitive half-time of bolus remifentanil is only 3.2 min (Glass
et al., 1993; Kapila et al., 1995). Therefore, remifentanil bolus
alone is not enough to attenuate the responses and the use of a
bolus-infusion regimen is required (McAtamney et al., 1998). The
commonly accepted and recommended dose of remifentanil is
1 μg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5–1 μg/kg/min for induction
of anesthesia or 0.05–2.0μg/kg/min for maintenance of anesthesia
(Burkle et al., 1996; Hall et al., 2000; Sneyd et al., 2001). In postop￾erative period, remifentanil continuous infusion (CI) also can be
used for controlling the pain, and the final remifentanil infusion
rates have been reported as 0.05–0.26 μg/kg/min for satisfactory

analgesia after surgery (Bowdle et al., 1996, 1997; Schuttler et al.,
1997; Yarmush et al., 1997; Sneyd et al., 2001).
Common concerns regarding the use of opioids are poten￾tial detrimental side effects, physical dependence, and addiction.
However, an additional concern has recently risen that these
opioids can induce an acute tolerance and hyperalgesia in dose
and/or time dependent manner even when used within clinical
accepted doses. They provide straight analgesic and antihyper￾algesic effects originally, but subsequently are associated with
expression of hyperalgesia (Angst and Clark, 2006). The use of
opioids may seem to be a double-edged sword. In other words,
patients receiving opioids to control their pain somewhat paradox￾ically may become more sensitive to pain as a direct result of opioid
therapy.
Therefore, a review of literature was carried out to analyze acute
tolerance and/or hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in peri￾operative period using electronic searches of Medline (PubMed,
Ovid, Springer, and Elsevier, ClinicalKey). The objective was
to address the following issues: (1) what is the definition of
acute opioid tolerance (AOT) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia
(OIH)? (2) Dose remifentanil may induce the acute tolerance and
hyperalgesia? (3) Are AOT and OIH significant enough to con￾sider reducing the dose of remifentanil or adopting preventive
modulations?
DEFINITION OF ACUTE OPIOID TOLERANCE AND
OPIOID-INDUCED HYPERALGESIA
Before we discuss AOT and OIH induced by remifentanil, we have
to understand the definitions of AOT and OIH because manage￾ment for pain control is different according to make a diagnosis
one of them;While AOT can be overcome by increasing the dosage,
OIH even worsens the pain. Consequently, OIH is reduced by
reducing or eliminating the opioid.
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is defined as a state of nociceptive
sensitization, which is characterized by a paradoxical response,
whereby a patient receiving opioids for pain treatment might have
an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli (Angst and Clark, 2006;
Chu et al., 2008). Even though controlled preclinical experiments
have defined OIH in animals as a decrease in pain threshold from
baseline after chronic administration of opioids (Fishbain et al.,
2009), there still is no accepted operational definition of OIH
among researchers in human clinical trials; hyperalgesia is defined
as decrease in either pain threshold or pain tolerance after chronic
opioid exposure (Martinez and Fletcher, 2012). Pain threshold is
the lowest intensity of stimulation at which pain is experienced,
and pain tolerance is the amount of pain from a given stimulus a
person can handle before seeking relief.
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia often is confused with opioid tol￾erance because of the manifestations of similar symptoms. AOT is
defined as an increase in the dose required maintaining adequate
analgesia in patients receiving opioid medication for the treatment
of pain in clinical settings (Angst and Clark, 2006; Chu et al., 2008).
Clinical data indicates that early postoperative pain scores and
subsequent greater demand of opioids could be attributed to tol￾erance, while the greater requirement for opioids at a later recovery
stage could be associated with OIH after high-dose remifentanil
anesthesia.
GENERAL CONSENSUS OF AOT AND OIH
Recently, many studies have focused on the development of AOT
and OIH after using opioids based on idea that OIH might be
a potential risk factor for the development of chronic pain after
surgery (Perkins and Kehlet, 2000; Woolf and Salter, 2000; Wilder￾Smith and Arendt-Nielsen, 2006). The circumstances under which
OIH may occur are also not yet entirely understood but may
include high doses, long-term treatment, or abrupt changes in
concentrations (Simonnet and Rivat, 2003). Most authors have
suggested that the higher dose of opioids induce the higher tol￾erance and/or hyperalgesia. OIH was observed either to follow
analgesia and lasted long after opioid exposure ended (Celerier
et al., 2000; Kissin et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001), or during con￾tinuous opioid exposure (Laulin et al., 1999; Vanderah et al.,
2000). It has been reported that high intraoperative doses of
opioids not only increase postoperative pain scores and acute
morphine consumption, but also induce significant nocicep￾tive threshold changes (Chia et al., 1999; Guignard et al., 2000;
Mao, 2002; Angst et al., 2003; Joly et al., 2005; Van Elstraete
et al., 2005; Cabanero et al., 2009). Celerier et al. (2000) showed
that fentanyl injection was associated with sustained lowering of
the nociceptive threshold below baseline value, and the higher
the fentanyl dose used, the more pronounced was the fentanyl￾induced hyperalgesia. Laulin et al. (1999) reported that repeated
once-daily heroin injections induced a gradual lowering of the
nociceptive threshold which progressively masked a sustained
heroin analgesic functional effect, which is suggested as opiate
tolerance.
If all types of opioids have been shown to induce such a
dose-dependent hypersensitivity, exposure to short-acting opi￾oids, such as remifentanil, seems more likely to be responsible
for postoperative high pain scores, high morphine consumption,
and hypersensitivity to pain (Guignard et al., 2000; Angst et al.,
2003; Hood et al., 2003; Koppert et al., 2003a). A relatively large￾dose of intraoperative remifentanil has been shown to induce
postoperative hyperalgesia more rapidly and more frequently as
compared with longer-acting opioids (Derrode et al., 2003; Joly
et al., 2005; Koppert and Schmelz, 2007). These results are in agree￾ment with the clinical observation of increased postoperative pain
and morphine requirement (Zarate et al., 1999; Guignard et al.,
2000, 2002).
As many papers suggest, remifentanil could induce AOT
and/or OIH (Vinik and Kissin, 1998; Hayashida et al., 2003;
Gomez de Segura et al., 2009; Aguado et al., 2011). Many
authors documented that remifentanil CI alone induced AOT
in the dose-dependent manner within first few hours in ani￾mal models (Hayashida et al., 2003; Aguado et al., 2011). A
study in healthy human volunteers performed by Vinik and
Kissin (1998) also suggested that AOT was profound and devel￾oped very rapidly, and remifentanil of 0.1 μg/kg/min resulted
in the maximum analgesic effect in 60–90 min, and then
began to decline despite the constant-rate infusion, eventually
reaching 1/4 of the peak value after 3 h of infusion, mea￾suring by cold thermal and mechanical noxious stimulation
(Vinik and Kissin, 1998).
A small number of clinical studies have looked at AOT and
OIH in the setting of acute perioperative opioid exposure. A series

Kim et al. Opioid induced hyperalgesia of remifentanil
of studies in patients undergoing surgery suggested that expo￾sure to a high rather than to a low intraoperative opioid dose was
associated with the increased opioid consumption and/or pain in
the postoperative period (Cooper et al., 1997; Chia et al., 1999;
Guignard et al., 2000; Joly et al., 2005). A feasible explanation for
these findings is either the development of acute tolerance on the
rescue opioids for controlling the postoperative pain or a possi￾ble OIH in patients exposed to a high intraoperative opioid dose
(Angst and Clark, 2006). Guignard et al. (2000) suggested that
AOT as well as OIH might be induced by the acute exposure to
large doses of opioids. The patients received 0.3 ± 0.2 μg/kg/min
of the intraoperative remifentanil required morphine significantly
earlier and needed nearly twice more morphine in the first 24
postoperative hours than those who remifentanil was kept con￾stant at 0.1 μg/kg/min. Furthermore, despite higher morphine
requirement, higher pain scores were observed in group that
remifentanil was infused higher. Joly et al. (2005), in their random￾ized, double-blind study, showed that intraoperative remifentanil
of 0.4 μg/kg/min triggered the larger hyperalgesia as well as
the larger morphine consumption for 48 postoperative hours,
compared with remifentanil of 0.05 μg/kg/min. In prospective,
randomized, double-blind study, they suggested that remifentanil
of mean 0.28 μg/kg/min was associated with the development
of clinically relevant AOT, in patients underwent the general
anesthesia using propofol infusion (Crawford et al., 2006).
Many authors showed that the OIH can develop differently
for different types of pain such as transdermal electrical stim￾ulation (Angst et al., 2003; Hood et al., 2003; Koppert et al.,
2003a,b; Troster et al., 2006), cold pressor pain (Compton et al.,
2003, 2004), and pressure-evoked pain (Luginbuhl et al., 2003).
Transdermal electrical stimulation used for inducing mechanical
hyperalgesia on an experimental skin lesion rendered hyperal￾gesia in human volunteers. These investigators suggested that
30–90 min of remifentanil exposure significantly enlarge the skin
area with pre-existing mechanical hyperalgesia by transdermal
electrical stimulation with direct relation of the infusion dura￾tion and the opioid dose (Angst et al., 2003; Hood et al., 2003;
Koppert et al., 2003a,b; Troster et al., 2006). This hyperalgesia
was sustained up to 4 h after stopping infusion (Hood et al.,
2003). They also documented that the pain score was increased
and the pain threshold was decrease, by dose-dependent man￾ner, after the discontinuation of opioids (Angst et al., 2003; Hood
et al., 2003; Koppert et al., 2003a). In a model of acute physi￾cal opioid dependence, which withdrawal was precipitated with
the opioid antagonist naloxone after a single injection of opioid
(Compton et al., 2003, 2004), the authors showed that sensitiv￾ity to cold pressor pain was significantly increased after injection
of naloxone and OIH may be triggered if opioid effect is sud￾denly disappeared or reversed. Finally, Luginbuhl et al. (2003)
suggested that remifentanil alone induced significant hyperal￾gesia detected by test for pressure pain tolerance threshold in
volunteers.
SUGGESTED DOSES OF REMIFENTANIL INDUCING AOT AND
OIH
Most articles documented that AOT and OIH were induced dur￾ing and after remifentanil infusion at ≥0.1 μg/kg/min (Vinik
and Kissin, 1998; Glass et al., 1999; Guignard et al., 2000; Gus￾torff et al., 2002; Angst et al., 2003; Koppert et al., 2003a; Joly
et al., 2005; Angst et al., 2009; Cabanero et al., 2009). In a
mouse model, they suggested that remifentanil-induced hyper￾algesia was induced by dose-dependent manner and the calcu￾lated ED50s for thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia was 1.7
(95% confidence interval, 1.3–2.1) and 1.26 (1.0–1.6) μg/kg/min,
respectively (Cabanero et al., 2009). Infusion of remifentanil
at a rate of 0.1 μg/kg/min induced the very rapid and pro￾found acute tolerance during infusion (Vinik and Kissin, 1998;
Glass et al., 1999), while a rate of 0.08 μg/kg/min could not
induce acute tolerance in the cold pressor test and in mod￾els of electrical and heat pain (Gustorff et al., 2002). Angst
et al. (2003) showed that pre-existing mechanical hyperalgesia
was significantly aggravated after discontinuation of remifentanil
at a rate of 0.10 μg/kg/min. Koppert et al. (2003a) also sug￾gested that even though remifentanil dose-dependently reduced
pain and mechanical hyperalgesia during the infusion, after
discontinuation of infusion, pain and mechanical hyperalgesia
increased significantly in group which was administered remifen￾tanil at a rate of 0.10 μg/kg/min compared with at a rate of
0.05 μg/kg/min. Furthermore, in the patients receiving higher
intraoperative remifentanil, such as 0.3 ± 0.2 and 0.4 μg/kg/min,
than 0.10 μg/kg/min, the time of first morphine requirement
was significantly earlier and the morphine consumption in the
first 24 or 48 postoperative hour was significantly lager, which
suggest that remifentanil causes AOT and hyperalgesia (Guig￾nard et al., 2000; Joly et al., 2005). Therefore, AOT as well as
OIH might be induced by the acute exposure to large doses of
opioids.
In studies on AOT and OIH, while most authors have used
the CI mode, there are a few reports using the target-controlled
infusion (TCI) mode (Hood et al., 2003; Angst et al., 2009; Shin
et al., 2010; Richebe et al., 2011). Hood et al. (2003) showed that
areas of hyperalgesia continuously enlarged 4 h after remifen￾tanil (targeted concentration of 3.1 ± 1.2 ng/ml) was stopped, to
180% ± 47%. Shin et al. (2010) suggested that remifentanil using
TCI at 4 ng/ml induced the more increased cumulative morphine
consumption and postoperative hyperalgesia than that at 1 ng/ml
during sevoflurane anesthesia. This result is similar with that of
previous studies using CI mode; higher dose of opioid, higher
development of AOT and OIH. The infusion rate for remifen￾tanil 0.1 μg/kg/min can achieve a stable plasma concentration
ranging between 2.7 and 2.9 ng/ml during the infusion (Angst
et al., 2003). A bolus of remifentanil 1 μg/kg followed by infu￾sion 0.2 μg/kg/min will produce stable plasma concentrations of
4–5 ng/ml within a few minutes (Minto et al., 1997). Angst et al.
(2009) documented that target remifentanil concentrations cor￾responding to infusion rates of 0.065 and 1.3 μg/kg/min did not
induce tolerance in any of their pain models. Remifentanil con￾centrations of 1.6 and 3.2 ng/ml, which are commonly used in a
clinical setting to provide analgesia during surgery, correspond to
steady-state concentrations achieved when infusing remifentanil
at a constant rate of about 0.065 and 0.13 μg/kg/min (Glass et al.,
1999). Therefore, according these references, ≥0.1 μg/kg/min
using CI mode and ≥2.7 ng/ml using TCI mode seem to be
sufficient to develop hyperalgesia.

CONTROVERSIAL RESULTS ON DEVELOPMENT OF AOT AND
OIH BY REMIFENTANIL
There is controversial results on AOT and OIH induced by
remifentanil at the perioperative period, even though many
authors suggested that remifentanil could induce them (Schraag
et al., 1999; Cortinez et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 2005; Lahtinen
et al., 2008; Angst et al., 2009; Yeom et al., 2012). Angst et al.
(2009) documented that 3 h infusion of remifentanil of up to
4.0 ng/ml was not associated with the development of significant
tolerance to analgesic in placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
Cortinez et al. (2001) also suggested that remifentanil-based anes￾thesia (0.23 ± 0.10 μg/kg/min, average duration; 116 min) did not
induce the AOT when compared with sevoflurane-based anesthe￾sia in patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Hansen
et al. (2005) investigated how remifentanil of 0.4 μg/kg/min intra￾operatively affected post-operative pain and opioid consumption
after major abdominal surgery. In a double-blind study, although
they found higher visual analog scale score in the remifentanil
group compared with placebo during the immediate postoper￾ative period, this difference was no longer significant 2 h after
surgery or during the remainder of the 24-h observation period.
A prospective, randomized, double-blind study, showed that
3 h infusion of remifentanil of 0.3 μg/kg/min did not increase
postoperative pain or opioid consumption in cardiac surgery
patients who underwent sufentanil/propofol-based general anes￾thesia (Lahtinen et al., 2008). Yeom et al. (2012) suggested that
remifentanil did not appear to cause AOT and OIH in patients
undergoing spinal fusion even though there was significant dif￾ferences in the mean intraoperative infusion rate of remifentanil
(0.16 μg/kg/min vs. 0.03 μg/kg/min) for a short period of time
(averaging 225 and 216 min, respectively). Schraag et al. (1999)
found that Remifentanil infusion using specially designed patient￾maintained TCI systems, which was controlled according to the
patients demand for postoperative pain control by up-and-down
method (intervals 0.2 ng/ml) did not show any evidence of
rapid development of acute tolerance in patients maintained hyp￾notic dose of remifentanil in the first six postoperative hours
from end of total intravenous anesthesia with remifentanil and
propofol.
FACTORS THAT LEAD TO DISCREPANCIES REGARDING AOT
AND OIH
The clinical relevance of above mentioned results is question￾able and there is some limitation in negative results concerning
AOT and OIH. These discrepancies can be explained by multi￾ple methodological issues including the administrated dose and
duration of opioids administration, the different infusion mode,
the co-administrated anesthetic drug’s effect, method assessing
pain sensitivity, and the repetitive and potentially tissue damaging
nature of the stimuli used to determine the threshold during opi￾oid infusion (Angst and Clark, 2006; Lahtinen et al., 2008; Fishbain
et al., 2009; Simonnet, 2009).
First, we can explain these discrepant results by differences
in exposed opioid doses and administration duration. Stud￾ies reporting positive results have shown that AOT develops in
dose-dependent fashion and only becomes evident when total
opioid exposure is quite high. The non-significant increase of
postoperative pain and opioid consumption in studies reporting
negative results may be noticed because of lower total intraoper￾ative opioid exposure when compared with the positive results,
suggesting a dose-dependent effect of opioids on the development
of OIH (Guignard et al., 2000; Cortinez et al., 2001; Lee et al.,
2005). Cabanero et al. (2009) agreed that remifentanil induced
dose-dependent pronociceptive effects for thermal and mechani￾cal hyperalgesia, which lasted longer with higher doses, but they
suggested that the duration of infusion did not alter the prono￾ciceptive effects of remifentanil. This negative result might be
explained by the shorter exposed duration, just over 30 or 60 min,
than the positive results studies, in which Acute tolerance is
typically investigated during CI over 2–3 h, whereas hyperalge￾sia is usually assessed within1hpost-infusion (Guignard et al.,
2000, 2002; Laulin et al., 2002; Hayashida et al., 2003; Gomez
de Segura et al., 2009; Benito et al., 2010; Aguado et al., 2011;
Ishida et al., 2012; Ishii et al., 2013). In the recent animal study,
they showed that intravenous remifentanil infusion alone induced
transient hyperalgesia associated with the duration of exposure to
remifentanil (Ishida et al., 2012). While 30 min remifentanil infu￾sion did not induce hyperalgesia, 120 min remifentanil infusion
induced the hyperalgesia regardless of dose. However, hyperal￾gesia was not sustained more than 60 min. Other study also
documented that remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia started from
2 h after surgery and reached its peak at 24–48 h after surgery
(Gu et al., 2009).
Also, it is not sufficient to explain the cause of these discrepan￾cies by using the dose and duration of remifentanil infusion. Some
authors have reported the negative results even though they used
remifentanil infusion rate that was enough to develop hyperalge￾sia. It can be partially explained by the effect of co-administrated
anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, sevoflurane and nitrous oxide.
Fodale et al. (2006) suggested that AOT was not induced when
remifentanil was co-administered with propofol or sevoflurane,
which produced an inhibiting effect at NMDA receptors neutral￾izing the remifentanil stimulation on these receptors. However,
Solt et al. (2006) documented that sevoflurane has only a mini￾mal inhibitory effect on NMDA receptors, which are considered
to be involved in the development of opioid-related hypersensitiv￾ity (Tompkins and Campbell, 2011). Relatively low sevoflurane
concentrations (1.0%) reverse OIH, but there was the lack of
effect of sevoflurane concentrations of 1.0 and 1.5% to oppose
hyperalgesia following high-dose opioids (Solt et al., 2006; Richebe
et al., 2009). Shin et al. (2010) also suggested that remifentanil￾induced hyperalgesia was not apparent during propofol anesthesia
compared with the effect produced during sevoflurane anesthe￾sia even though dosage of remifentanil was increased from 1.0
to 4.0 ng/ml. This result can be supported by that propofol
may have some modulatory effect on OIH, through inhibi￾tion of the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor (Orser
et al., 1995; Kingston et al., 2006), which is one of the poten￾tial mechanisms that induced the OIH, and possibly through
interactions with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptors
at the supraspinal level (Wang et al., 2004; Singler et al., 2007).
Specifically, sub-hypnotic dose of propofol has analgesic effects,
which delayed the onset of anti-analgesia after remifentanil infu￾sion (Singler et al., 2007). However, the clinical significance of

Kim et al. Opioid induced hyperalgesia of remifentanil
these findings, especially in higher dosages used in the intra￾operative setting, remains to be studied. In addition, some
authors ignored the impact that nitrous oxide might have against
the AOT and hyperalgesia (Cortinez et al., 2001; Yeom et al.,
2012). Echevarria et al. (2011) reported that the group using the
70% nitrous oxide with remifentanil of 0.3 μg/kg/min showed
a greater decreased mechanical threshold than the group with￾out nitrous oxide at postoperative 12–18 h, even though the
postoperative pain scores and cumulative morphine consump￾tion was similar between the groups. Lee et al. (2005) suggested
that 70% nitrous oxide showed comparable effect on the post￾operative opioid consumption similar to remifentanil at mean
0.17 μg/kg/min.
Next, different infusion mode also can influence the develop￾ment of AOT and OIH even though they have an equipotential
effect on the pain control. TCI has been shown not only to
improve intraoperative hemodynamic stability but also to decrease
intraoperative remifentanil requirements (Minto et al., 1997; De
Castro et al., 2003). Interestingly, Richebe et al. (2011) evalu￾ated whether the use of TCI mode also would lead to decrease
in early postoperative period hyperalgesia after cardiac surgery.
They suggested that an infusion of intraoperative remifentanil
using TCI mode (7 ng/ml) reduced postoperative hyperalgesia,
compared with that using CI mode (0.3 μg/kg/min), and this
decrease in postoperative hyperalgesia was sustained and lasted
throughout the 1st postoperative week. The conclusion of the
study was supported by the difference of intraoperative infused
total remifentanil dose, which was greater in CI than in TCI
group.
Then, the possibility of cumulative tissue injury manifesting
as AOT or OIH should be carefully excluded (Petrenko et al.,
2012). Especially, this is likely to occur with repetitive testing
protocols in a situation in which protective withdrawal reflexes
are impaired or abolished by opioid administration. In Luginbuhl
et al.’s (2003)study, they exposed volunteers to significantly higher
nociceptive input during remifentanil vs. during saline placebo
administration. It cannot be excluded that postinfusion hyperal￾gesia resulted from more intense noxious stimulation during the
remifentanil infusion rather than the opioid administration itself.
On the other hand, Ishii et al. (2013) documented that neither
acute tolerance nor hyperalgesia was observed even in the set￾ting when they used a tapered remifentanil infusion to rapidly
attain maximum analgesic effect of remifentanil and tried to min￾imize the repetitive and potentially tissue damaging nature of the
stimuli.
Finally, it might contribute to influence of development of OIH,
in studies exposing patients to high intraoperative opioid doses,
whether assessment of pain sensitivity before and after surgery
was formally done or not. No causal relationship between acute
perioperative opioid exposure and development of OIH can be
established without direct measurement of pain sensitivity. If
patients have a comorbidity affecting sensory thresholds preop￾eratively, this condition could distort postoperative measures on
OIH. The German Network on Neuropathic Pain established a
standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol to inves￾tigate the somatosensory thresholds in healthy subjects and in
patients with neuropathic pain (Rolke et al., 2006). Reference
values from healthy subjects could be used to establish normal
sensory functioning in patients before anesthesia. In a clinical set￾ting, this direct measure could be used for distinguishing between
OIH and AOT, because of clinical importance, as AOT can be
overcome by dose increase, while OIH may be aggravated by the
same intervention. Without direct measures to assess hyperal￾gesia such as QST, the results are not easy to distinguish from
acute tolerance (Vinik and Kissin, 1998). Clinical studies exam￾ining remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia by QST showed that, at
a relatively high dose, remifentanil decreased the pain threshold
(Gustorff et al., 2002; Joly et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2007; Song
et al., 2011; Yalcin et al., 2012). These studies used remifentanil
infusions at clinically standard rates, and all of them showed clear
hyperalgesia either shortly after discontinuing infusion or 1 and
2 days postoperatively. However, most studies confirmed the real￾ity of this phenomenon using indirect evidences, such as greater
postoperative pain and morphine consumptions instead of using
QST (Guignard et al., 2000; Rauf et al., 2005). Treskatsch et al.
(2014) did not demonstrate any influence on clinical outcome
parameters of pain after remifentanil of >0.2 μg/kg/min, and
they suggested that indirect evidences might be less sensitive to
detect OIH compared with QST. Therefore, we think that a fur￾ther study is needed to reveal the development of AOT and OIH
using QST.
IMPORTANCE OF AOT AND/OR OIH IN CONSIDERING THE
REDUCTION OF REMIFENTANIL DOSAGE AND ADOPTING
PREVENTIVE MODULATIONS
Forty-one percentage of all surgical patients still experience mod￾erate to severe acute postoperative pain and that 24% experience
inadequate pain relief (Dolin et al., 2002). It has recently been
highlighted that chronic pain as a direct result of surgery is more
common than previously recognized (Perkins and Kehlet, 2000).
Furthermore, in cohort study on postoperative remifentanil￾induced hyperalgesia, its incidence was reported 16.1% of patients
undergoing general anesthesia with remifentanil (Ma et al., 2011).
Hyperalgesia and increased pain in the postoperative period is
now considered a major candidate mechanism for the develop￾ment of chronic pain (Perkins and Kehlet, 2000; Woolf and Salter,
2000; Wilder-Smith and Arendt-Nielsen, 2006). Therefore, less
postoperative hyperalgesia results in better acute postoperative
pain control (Joly et al., 2005), and interventions associated with
alterations of postoperative hyperalgesia are also associated with
changes in acute postoperative pain outcomes (Guignard et al.,
2000; Rauf et al., 2005).
However, there is a lack of good quality clinical research in
this area, despite the fairly extensive basic science evidence. In
a structured evidence-based review for all levels of evidence on
OIH in humans (Fishbain et al., 2009), they suggested that there
was not sufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of
OIH in humans except in the case of normal volunteers receiv￾ing opioid infusions. There was consistent evidence that opioid
infusion in normal volunteers induced either an increase in sec￾ondary hyperalgesia or allodynia, and there was inconsistent
evidence on pain threshold and tolerance in normal volunteers
or chronic pain patients although the threshold decreased with
opioid infusion. They also documented that using of opioid in
www.frontiersin.org May 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 108 | 5

Kim et al. Opioid induced hyperalgesia of remifentanil
perioperative period increased the postoperative pain or opi￾oid requirements with inconsistent evidence. In other recent
evidence based systematic review (Rivosecchi et al., 2014), they
suggested that remifentanil might induce a degree of hyperalgesia,
but it did not reach a level of clinical significance that requires
prevention.
There are some questions regarding the importance of the drug
use to preventAOT and OIH in postoperative patients and whether
the assessment of OIH at immediate postoperative period is suit￾able. Clinical studies assessing the preventive effect of drugs on
OIH in the immediate postoperative period, showed that the clin￾ical benefit is either absent (Echevarria et al., 2011), limited to a
moderate opioid-sparing effect (Joly et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2010),
or a slight reduction in pain scores (Shin et al., 2010; Song et al.,
2011). According to these results, Martinez and Fletcher (2012)
suggested that the immediate postoperative period may not be
the optimal period to detect the preventive effects on OIH, even
though additional clinical data need to confirm it.
Furthermore, Simonnet and Rivat (2003) suggested that OIH
should be considered as a normal adaptive response counter￾acting the perturbations caused by administration of analgesic
opioids. However, it is tempting to speculate that the long
lasting hyperalgesia induced by endogenous or exogenous opi￾oids may still facilitate learning processes and memorization of
drives so that environmental changes which might lead to pain
may be better avoided. From a medical viewpoint, OIH fol￾lowing a first opioid administration is not a passive response
but it might be considered as the first step of an active pro￾cess leading to pain sensitization. This suggests that opioids have
reinforced a nociceptive memory which could contribute to pain
chronicization.
CONCLUSION
Current experimental and clinical data generally support the
development of AOT and OIH in specific settings such as acute
remifentanil exposure in human volunteer and postsurgical pain
cohorts when remifentanil was infused at ≥0.1 μg/kg/min either
alone or with inhalation anesthetics. Therefore, in these sit￾uations, clinicians need to be cautious for the possibility of
the development of AOT and OIH, which may impair treat￾ment of pain or even aggravate preexisting pain. Clinicians
should suspect manifestation of OIH when opioid treatment
effect seems to decline in the absence of disease progression,
with unexplained pain reports or allodynia unassociated with
the site of injury. According to the previous reported results,
co-administrated anesthetic drugs, such as propofol and nitrous
oxide, and using of TCI model seem to be helpful to modu￾late the development of the AOT and OIH. However, there are
not sufficient data to support the evidence of modulatory effect
of them. Finally, we also cannot find any strong consistent evi￾dence to support the need to reduce the dose of remifentanil
or apply the modalities for preventing the AOT and the OIH.
Consequently, further studies will need to investigate whether
remifentanil induce the AOT and the OIH after general anesthesia
using propofol, nitrous oxide, or TCI mode through high quality
prospective trials. And the development of the AOT and the OIH
should be evaluated with direct measures such as QST. It is also
important to investigate if remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia may
contribute to the development of chronic pain, and if this contri￾bution can be attenuated or even reversed through pharmacologic
modulation.
