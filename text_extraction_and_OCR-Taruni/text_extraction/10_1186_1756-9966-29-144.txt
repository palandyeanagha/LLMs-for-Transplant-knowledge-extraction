Abstract
Background: Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is frequently used for gene expression quantification
due to its methodological reproducibility and sensitivity. The gene expression is quantified by normalization to one
or more reference genes which are presumed stably expressed throughout a given experiment. The aim of this
study was to validate a standardized experimental setup to identifying reference genes for normalization of
qRT-PCR in the metastatic and non-metastatic colon cancer.
Methods: In this study, expression of 16 commonly used reference genes was quantified in tumour tissue and
individual-matched normal mucosa in 18 non-metastatic colon cancer patients and 20 colon cancer patients with
distant metastases using TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA). The expression stability was determined and
compared by means of geNorm and NormFinder.
Results: Two pairs of genes, HPRT1/PPIA and IPO8/PPIA, were identified to be suitable to normalize gene
expression data in metastatic and non-metastatic colon cancer patients, according to geNorm and NormFinder
respectively.
Conclusion: We propose a standardized approach of finding the most suitable reference gene(s) in every qRT-PCR
experiment using TLDA.
Background
qRT-PCR is one of the most sensitive methods for
mRNA detection and quantification. The method has
also become the preferred method for validating results
obtained by other techniques, such as microarray [1].
There are differences among different qRT-PCR assays
due to biological and technical variations [2,3]. In order
to identify truly gene specific variations it is important to
use a suitable normalization method. One of the most
commonly used approaches involves relative quantifica￾tion of target genes against one or more reference genes
which are thought to be stably expressed in the examined
tissue [4]. There have been a number of reports that
demonstrate that the expression levels of putative refer￾ence genes vary extensively in different tissues and dis￾eases and thus are unsuitable for normalization purposes
[5-15]. Consequently, each research group has to validate
multiple reference genes in their own experimental setup
and normalize qRT-PCR data against a few reference
genes tested from independent pathways using at least
one algorithm. It appears that improvements in methods
of identifying reference genes are more important than
the identification of the particular reference genes them￾selves [16].
It has been argued for use of multiple genes in the nor￾malization of qRT-PCR analysis and several algorithms
have been developed [17-20]. Vandesompele et al., 2002,
used the geometric mean of the most stable genes to
improve the accuracy of the analysis in a method called
geNorm [19]. This method relies on the principle that
the expression ratio of two ideal reference genes is identi￾cal in all samples regardless of the experimental condi￾tions. For every reference gene geNorm determine the
pairwise variation with all other reference genes. The
average pairwise variation of a particular gene is defined
as the internal control stability measure; M. Genes with

the lowest M values are the most stable ones. Another
algorithm in which the expressional stability of genes is
evaluated is NormFinder [17]. NormFinder estimates the
intra-group and the inter-group expression variation.
Both of these sources of variation are combined into a
stability value. This method can account for heterogene￾ity of the tested tissue samples. Genes with the lowest
stability value have the most stable expression.
Colorectal cancer is among the most frequent malignant
diseases worldwide, and is one of the leading causes of
cancer-related deaths [21]. The majority of colorectal
tumours develop along a well-defined adenoma-carcinoma
sequence in which oncogenes are activated and tumour
suppressor genes lose their function [22]. Despite a high
5-year survival rate in early colorectal cancer, only 10% of
the patients with distant metastases survive after five years
[23]. Thus, it is important to elucidate the biology that
contributes to this progression, especially those processes
that facilitates the switch to invasive and metastatic dis￾ease. Biological changes are a result of partly differential
gene expression, which can be confirmed by qRT-PCR. It
is necessary to validate reference genes in the particular
experimental system in order to trust the differential gene
expressions which are detected. Previous studies have
tried to find universally stable reference genes across sev￾eral types of cancers, including colon cancer [24-26].
Recent reports, however, claim that stably expressed genes
in one tumour type may not predict stable expression in
another tumour type [12,27]. Moreover, results in one
tumour type, like colorectal cancer, show stably expressed
genes in one experimental in which are different from the
stably expressed genes in another experimental setup
[28-30]. Hence, reference genes should be validated and
selected in every experiment in any tissue type. Recently, it
has been suggested that the focus should be on introdu￾cing and validating novel approach for reference gene
identification and standardizing experimental setup rather
than giving general suggestions for different tissues [16].
Applying TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) to examin￾ing reference genes is a step towards a more standardized
experimental setup. TLDA was evaluated in colorectal
cancer by Lü et al., 2008, as a roughly robust and labour￾saving method for gene quantification compared with rou￾tine qRT-PCR [31]. Well-designed TaqMan probes require
little optimization, and TLDA allows simultaneously real￾time detection of many gene products in several samples
offering higher through put than established single array
method [31,32]. Hence, in the present study we used
TLDA to find potential reference genes for data normali￾zation in qRT-PCR experiments in metastatic and non￾metastatic colon cancer patients. The gene expression of
16 commonly used reference genes in tumour tissue
and individual-matched normal mucosa of metastatic and
non-metastatic colon cancer patients were analyzed and
the expression stability was determined and compared
using geNorm and NormFinder.
Methods
Patients and tissue specimens
RNAlater-stored tumour tissue samples and individual￾matched normal mucosa were obtained from 38 patients
with colonic adenocarcinoma who underwent resection
at Akershus University Hospital Trust between 2004
and 2009. The dissected tissue samples were collected in
the operating room and stored immediately in approxi￾mately five volumes of RNAlater (Ambion Inc., Austin
TX, USA) and frozen at -80°C. Eighteen patients with
non-metastatic disease, Dukes B (with a minimum of 12
negative lymph nodes) where no metastases occurred
during 5 years follow up, and 20 patients originally
staged as Duke C who displayed distant metastases dur￾ing a 5 year follow-up (Duke C) or patients classified as
Dukes D were included in the study. There were 22
women and 16 men with a mean age of 69 +/- 14 years
(range 29-92) at surgery. Three sectioned pieces of the
tumour samples were made. The central piece was
further processed for RNA isolation, while the two end
pieces were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
(FFPE). Four μm sections of FFPE samples were stained
with Hagens Hematoxylin and examined by a patholo￾gist for determination of percentage tumour cells. To
avoid bias from necrosis or minimal tumour representa￾tion we included tumour tissue samples with more than
70% tumour cells.
mRNA isolation
Total RNA isolation was performed using the method of
Wei and Khan, 2002, [33] modified according to T. Lüders
(unpublished work) to also include miRNA for further
analyses. Approximately 60 mg frozen tissue was homoge￾nized in TriReagent (Ambion) using Mixer Mill MM301
(Retch) for 2 × 2 min at 30 Hz. After phase-separation
with chloroform, the aqueous phase (containing RNA)
was mixed with 1.5 volumes 100% ethanol and transferred
to an RNeasy Mini spin column (Qiagen). Further proces￾sing was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol.
A DNase treatment was included in the procedure. RNA
was eluted in 60 μl RNase-free water and stored at -80°C.
The concentration of each RNA sample was obtained
from A260 measurements using the NanoDrop 2000
(Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.). The RNA integrity num￾ber (RIN) was tested by using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies).
cDNA synthesis
Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were produced from 1
μg RNA of each sample using the High Capacity RNA￾to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to

the manufacturer’s instructions. The following thermal
cycler conditions were used: 5 min at 25°C, 30 min at
42°C and 5 min at 85°C. Three random RNA samples
were additionally run in the absence of reverse tran￾scriptase enzyme to assess the degree of contaminating
genomic DNA. Real-time PCR with genomic DNA spe￾cific assay revealed that RNA was free of genomic DNA
(data not shown).
TLDA design and preparation
TaqMan Endogenous Control Assays (Applied Biosys￾tems) are 384-well microfluidic cards containing 16 preop￾timized human TaqMan Gene Expression Assays
commonly used as endogenous controls and genes that
exhibit minimal differential expression across different tis￾sues (Table 1). The assay was performed in triplicates. 50
μl cDNA (1 μg mRNA) was used as a template. Matched
samples from 4 patients where loaded on each card. NTC
(no template control) was added in one loading port. PCR
amplification was performed using the ABI Prism 7900
HT Real Time PCR System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosys￾tems, Foster City, California, USA). Thermal cycling con￾ditions were used as follows: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at
94.5°C, 30 sec at 97°C, and 1 min at 59.7°C for 40 cycles.
TLDA analysis and Statistical analysis
RealTime Statminer 3.0 Software (Integromics, Madrid,
Spain) was used for implementation of quality controls in
addition to calculation of optimal endogenous controls.
This program uses the comparative Ct method for relative
quantification analysis, and the results are expressed as a
fold change of expression levels (DDCt values). The mean
value of triplicates was applied for all calculations. Med￾ians were used to replace missing values that occurred due
to inconsistencies between replicates rather than from low
expression. The detectability threshold was set to 36,
meaning failing detectors are those with a Ct greater than
or equal to 36. To measure the expressional stability of the
candidate endogenous control genes, two commonly used
programs were employed: geNorm [19] and NormFinder
[17], both of which available in RealTime Statminer. Ct
coefficients of variations (CtCV%) were calculated for
every reference gene across all samples. All data are
expressed as means ± SD. Except from the analyses in
RealTime Statminer, all other calculations were performed
using SPSS (version 14.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

was ranged from 7.2 to 10.0, with a mean value of 8.9,
which indicates good preservation of the RNA; thus sui￾table for RNA studies.
Range of expression of candidate endogenous control
genes
Table 2 presents the mean Ct and SD values obtained
across the candidate endogenous control genes in nor￾mal and tumour tissue separated into the two groups of
patients; non-metastatic and metastatic colon cancer
patients. Additional calculations across all patients are
shown in Table 3. Mean Ct values ranged from 8.71
(± 1.31 SD) (18S) across all samples to 26.70 (± 1.69
SD) (TBP). The gene with the lowest standard deviation
across all samples was IPO8 which showed an overall
SD of 1.28, while the gene with the highest standard
deviation across the samples was PGK1 with an overall
SD of 2.49. The reference genes displayed a relatively
broad range of expression. PGK1 had the widest range
of Ct values between 8.35 and 29.83 (mean 21.03 ± 2.49
SD, range of 21.47), while B2M had the narrowest range
of Ct values between 15.25 and 23.59 (mean 17.10 ±
1.31 SD, range of 8.34). During the subsequent analyses
using Statminer Ct values above 36 are excluded and
imputed, because Ct values above this level are not reli￾able. This quality control will thus influence the Ct
ranges.
Results of validation programs
In order to determine the stability of genes and thus
find the best endogenous controls, the data were ana￾lysed by geNorm and NormFinder. In these analyses,
medians were used to replace missing values because
they occurred due to inconsistencies between replicates
rather than from low expression. The ranking of the
gene expression stability values (M) of the tested endo￾genous control genes using geNorm is illustrated in
Figure 1.A. The genes with the highest M, i.e. the least
stable genes, gets stepwise excluded until the most
stable genes remain. The best two genes are ranked
without distinguishing between them. HPRT1 and PPIA
were identified as the most stable pair of genes, followed
by PGK1 as the third most stable gene. Furthermore,
pairwise variation were also calculated using geNorm in
order to determine the optimal number of genes
required for normalization, Figure 1.B. The analysis
showed that HPRT1 and PPIA may be sufficient for cal￾culation of the normalization factor and normalization
to genes of interest, since the V2/3 value is in this ana￾lysis equal to the cut-off value of 0.15 [19]. However,
there is a gradual decrease in the pairwise variability
plot and thereby an improvement to the normalization
factor by adding additional genes to the calculation.
Nevertheless, two or three genes would be satisfactory
for normalization according to the cut-off value of 0.15.
While geNorm uses a pairwise comparison approach,
NormFinder first estimates the intra-group and then the
inter-group variability of expression of a control gene
[17]. In contrast to the geNorm results, NormFinder
ranked RPLP0 as the most stable gene, with TBP and
GUSB closely behind as second and third, respectively
(Figure 2). However, using this algorithm the combina￾tion of IPO8 and PPIA turned out to have a lower stabi￾lity score than the most stable single gene. Thus this

combination is more suitable for normalizing qPCR.
There was considerably closer agreement between the
geNorm and Normfinder results on the least stable
genes, with the order of 4 out of 5 worst ranking genes
being identical; ACTB, 18S, B2M and TFRC. These
genes had a stability value more than twice so high
(geNorm) and more than 3 times so high (NormFinder)
as the best ranking genes.
Due to different ranking by geNorm and NormFinder
of the most stable genes, cycle threshold coefficient of
variation (CtCV%) was calculated for each of them. This
calculation was recommended by Caradec et al., 2010, in
order to validate the NormFinder and geNorm results
[12]. According to the CtCV% calculation, one of the
NormFinder pairing genes, IPO8, was ranked as the most
stable gene with a CtCV% of 5.12%, which supports the
NormFinder result. GUSB (5.5%) and HPRT1 (6.04%) are
ranked as the second and third respectively, which do
not give identical ranking of results obtain using geNorm
and NormFinder. The least stable gene using CtCV% was
18S (14.99%), which was according to geNorm and
NormFinder ranked as the second and fifth least stable
gene, respectively. The summary of the best ranking
genes as determined by each of these calculations is illu￾strated in Table 4.
Discussion
qRT-PCR has been a breakthrough for the quantification
of gene expression in many biological systems. In this
study we assume that no single gene stays unaffected
under malignant development in colon cancer and there￾fore identify genes with least variation. We identified two
pairs of genes, HPRT1/PPIA and IPO8/PPIA, which may
be suitable to normalize gene expression data in studies
conducted in metastatic and non-metastatic colon cancer
patients. In addition, we found that B2M, ACTB and 18S
were unstable in the tissue examined. We propose a stan￾dardized approach of finding the most suitable reference
gene(s) in every qRT-PCR experiment using TLDA.
Complex signalling pathways have been related to the
metastatic progression of colon cancer, hence pathway
based gene expression assays, often revealed by qRT￾PCR, are significant in cancer biology. Publications deal￾ing with colon cancer have reported gene expression
studies in metastatic diseases [34,35]. However, the sta￾bility of the reference gene expression in metastatic and
non-metastatic primary tumours remains crucial.
Ramaswamy et al., 2003, described a gene expression
signature that distinguished primary and metastatic ade￾nocarcinomas, indicating that the metastatic potential of
human tumours is encoded in the bulk of the primary
tumour [36], fully in accordance with modern clonal
stem cell theories [37]. Hence, one may presume that
the metastatic capacity of the primary tumour will influ￾ence commonly chosen reference genes.
The most recent study of reference genes in colon
cancer was reported by Kheirelseid et al., 2010, where
64 colorectal tumours and tumour associated normal
specimens were examined using qRT-PCR followed by
three different statistical algorithms, geNorm, NormFin￾der and qBaseplus [30]. Kheirelseid et al., 2010, found
that the combination of two reference genes, B2M and
PPIA, more accurately normalized qRT-PCR data in col￾orectal cancer. This is in concordance with our findings,
where PPIA was one of the two genes identified as the
most stable pair. In contrast, B2M was identified as one

of the most variable genes in the tissue examined. This
disparity may be explained by the difference in patient
material since Kheirelseid et al., 2010, included all stages
of colon cancer and even included rectum tumour sam￾ples. Furthermore the percentage of tumour cells in the
samples was not addressed. In the study of Kheirelseid
et al., 2010, all three algorithms confirmed the selection
of the B2M and PPIA pairing as the best combination
of reference genes. In the present study however, the
geNorm algorithm differs from the results obtained by
NormFinder. According to geNorm HPRT1 and PPIA
were the most suitable genes for normalization, but
NormFinder suggested IPO8 and PPIA. This discre￾pancy confirms previous results reported by Caradec
et al., 2010, concluding that the evaluation of suitable
reference genes dramatically differs according to the sta￾tistical method used [12]. Caradec et al., 2010, investi￾gated reference genes in four cell lines treated with four
different oxygen concentrations, and observed large var￾iations in gene expression results depending of statistical
method used. Thus Caradec et al., 2010, recommended
Ct coefficients of variation (CtCV%) calculation for each
reference gene for validation of the statistical methods.
It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the

mean. Genes with low CtCV% value indicate more
stable expression of those genes. In the present study,
IPO8 was the most stable gene on the basis of CtCV%
(5.12%), followed by GUSB (5.55%) and HPRT1 (6.04%)
as the second and third most stable gene. Using Norm￾Finder IPO8 was one of the genes which were identified
as the most stable pair of genes, which may indicate
that the CtCV% verifies the NormFinder results. Never￾theless, PPIA, which was suggested by both geNorm and
NormFinder as one of the stable pair of genes, was
ranked as the tenth most stable gene with a CtCV% of
7.34%. This may be explained by the low Ct mean of
this particular gene (18.0), resulting in a relatively high
CtCV% despite a low standard deviation. Another aspect
which strengthens the results achieved by NormFinder
compared with geNorm is the argument that geNorm
lacks robustness compared with NormFinder [32].
Reports show that exclusion of one sample in a specific
tissue collection led geNorm to change a suggested
reference gene (18S) from being an unstable gene to
one of the top ranking stable genes [32]. NormFinder
also enables estimation of the variation between sample
subgroups, like tumour and normal tissue, thus this
algorithm can account for heterogeneity in the tested
samples, which may be important considering the het￾erogeneity of the samples studied.
The optimal normalization will vary with study design.
The most suitable reference gene in one medical condi￾tion may be regulated in other tissues or diseases. Blan￾quicett et al., 2002, found that 18S, S9 and GUS were
the least regulated genes among 15 putative reference
genes when examining tumour and normal colorectal
and liver tissues [28]. Furthermore, Dydensborg et al.,
2006, identified B2M as the most appropriate gene for
normalizing colon carcinomas comparing to normal
mucosa when they investigated seven colon adenocarci￾nomas containing both epithelial and stromal cells [29].
B2M was in this study identified as the least stable gene
using NormFinder, and the third most variable gene
using geNorm. In the present study where the tumour
tissue samples consisted of more than 70% tumour cells
some of the stromal cells are excluded. This might
explain the discrepancies in the ranking of B2M since
tumour tissue is heterogeneous and the fraction of dif￾ferent cells may influence the gene expression results.
Moreover, different patient groups, including age and
clinical background, may also give dissimilarities across
studies. Experimental variations may also influence the
gene expression results, though using triplicates in the
qRT-PCR analysis as used in this study will diminish
this variation.
Single assays qRT-PCR are time- and labour-intensive,
and require relatively large amounts of cDNA and PCR
reagents in multivariate gene expression studies. TLDA

overcome these drawbacks since this technique allows
for simultaneously detection of expression of up to 384
genes and requires less template cDNA and PCR
reagents than routine qRT-PCR [1,31,38-40].
Conclusions
In this study we applied TaqMan Low Density Array in
order to identify reference genes in metastatic and non￾metastatic colon cancer. The genes often used for nor￾malization of gene expression data may be unstable and
thus not suited for use, and therefore identifying stable
reference genes in the specific experiment is vital for the
results. The approach described herein can serve as a
template to identify valid reference genes in any disease
state. However, the optimal statistical approach to iden￾tify the best reference gene(s) remains to be determined.
In the present study NormFinder and geNorm identified
two different pairs of the most stable genes. The use of
CTCV% might be a good validation of the two results.
Nevertheless, the expression of target genes should be
evaluated and a comparison of the effect of each pair of
reference genes should be determined.
