ABSTRACT
Background Whole blood viscoelastic testing (VET) 
devices are routinely used in a variety of clinical settings to 
assess hemostasis. The Quantra QStat System is a cartridge￾based point of care VET device that measures changes 
in clot stiffness during coagulation and fibrinolysis using 
ultrasound detection of resonance. The objective of this 
study was to assess the ability of the Quantra QStat System 
to detect coagulopathies in trauma patients.
Methods A multicenter observational study was 
conducted on adult subjects at two level 1 trauma centers. 
For each subject, whole blood samples were drawn upon 
arrival to the emergency department and again, in some 
cases, after administration of blood products and/or 
antifibrinolytics. Samples were analyzed on the Quantra 
in parallel to ROTEM delta. The QStat cartridge provides 
measures of Clot Time (CT), Clot Stiffness (CS), Fibrinogen 
and Platelet Contributions to clot stiffness (FCS and PCS), 
and Clot Stability to Lysis (CSL). Data analyses included 
linear regression of Quantra and ROTEM parameters and an 
assessment of the concordance of the two devices for the 
assessment of hyperfibrinolysis.
Results A total of 56 patients were analyzed. 42% 
of samples had a low QStat CS value suggestive of an 
hypocoagulable state. The low stiffness values could 
be attributed to either low PCS, FCS or combination. 
Additionally, 13% of samples showed evidence of 
hyperfibrinolysis based on the QStat CSL parameter. 
Samples analyzed with ROTEM assays showed a lower 
prevalence of low CS and hyperfibrinolysis based on 
EXTEM and FIBTEM results. The correlation of CS, FCS 
and CT versus equivalent ROTEM parameters was strong 
with r-values of 0.83, 0.79 and 0.79, respectively.
Discussion This first clinical experience with the 
Quantra in trauma patients showed that the QStat 
Cartridge was strongly correlated with ROTEM 
parameters and that it could detect coagulopathies 
associated with critical bleeding.
Level of evidence Diagnostic test, Level II.
INTRODUCTION
Trauma patients often present with an array of 
coagulation defects during their clinical course, 
with hemorrhage posing the greatest risk of early 
mortality following traumatic injury.1–3 Coagu￾lopathy, defined as disturbance of the physiologic 
balance between bleeding and clotting, is observed 
in up to one-third of major trauma patients.2 4 5
This condition, in combination with hypothermia 
and metabolic acidosis, is responsible for signifi￾cant mortality in the injured patient population. 
While the pathophysiology of trauma-induced 
coagulopathy is currently a subject of intense clinical 
and scientific research, the current understanding 
indicates a multifactorial condition driven primarily 
from hypoperfusion, endothelial cell damage, 
inflammation and tissue trauma.5–11 These factors 
have been shown to result in variable activation 
of the protein C pathway resulting in dysfunction 
of several coagulation factors, autoheparinization 
from glycocalyx damage, fibrinogen consumption, 
platelet dysfunction and unregulated fibrinolytic 
function.5 6 12 13 In particular, hyperfibrinolysis, an 
increased and unbalanced activation of the fibrino￾lytic system, has been recognized as one of the main 
factors contributing to the coagulopathic spectrum 
observed in trauma and other critical care settings. 
Recent studies have suggested that measurement of 
fibrinolysis is a marker for acute traumatic coagu￾lopathy and a predictor for massive transfusion.14 15
Whole blood viscoelastic testing (VET) devices 
have been used to monitor coagulation and 
fibrinolytic function in trauma and emergency 
departments.16–19 The main technologies include 
thromboelastography, TEG 5000 (Haemonetics 
Corp, Braintree, Massachusetts, USA) and throm￾boelastometry, ROTEM delta (Instrumentation 
Laboratory, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA). To date, 
many major trauma centers have adopted whole 
blood VET devices to assess coagulopathies and 
direct transfusion therapy in bleeding patients with 
major injury.
The Quantra System (HemoSonics, LLC, Char￾lottesville, Virginia, USA) was recently introduced 
as an alternative technology for VET designed for 
operation at the point of care and in critical care 
settings.20 The system uses an ultrasound-based 
technology that does not require moving parts or 
direct contact with the sample being measured 
while enabling a comprehensive set of internal 
quality control measures.21 The performance of 
the Quantra with the QPlus Cartridge has been 
previously reported in a number of single-center 
and multicenter studies involving patients under￾going elective surgical procedures22–26 and, most 
recently, in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.27 A 
new cartridge has been developed for the Quantra, 
the QStat Cartridge, which provides CT and CS 
measurements and a test to assess fibrinolytic func￾tion. In this study, we sought to compare the Quantra 
Hemostasis Analyzer with the QStat Cartridge to 
the ROTEM analyzer in a first multicenter study in 
the adult trauma population. We hypothesized that 
there would be a strong correlation in clot parame￾ters between the two instruments.

METHODS
A multicenter prospective, observational pilot study evaluating 
the performance of the Quantra Hemostasis Analyzer with the 
QStat Cartridge was conducted at two sites in the USA: the Texas 
Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso, Texas, in the 
University Medical Center of El Paso Emergency Department 
and at Parkland Memorial Hospital/The University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. The study protocol 
was registered under Clinical Trial numbers NCT03912545 
and NCT03934983, respectively. Through a deferred consent 
process, each participant or their legally authorized represen￾tative was approached to provide written informed consent to 
enable release of their data to the study database.
The assessment of the clinical performance of the Quantra 
QStat System in trauma patients was based on two primary 
analyses: (1) correlation of QStat results with corresponding 
ROTEM delta parameters and (2) concordance between the 
QStat assessment of fibrinolysis (CSL) and the corresponding 
ROTEM delta lysis parameter (EXTEM ML).
Population and study protocol
The study population included adult patients, 18 years or older, 
experiencing major trauma requiring care at a level 1 trauma 
center. Exclusion criteria included the inability to obtain consent 
(either prior to performing any study related procedure or by 
deferred consent) or enrollment in another study that might 
confound results. Both clinical sites currently use site-specific 
algorithms for ROTEM delta guided trauma resuscitations, 
including indications for antifibrinolytic therapy. While both 
centers allow for the empiric, prophylactic administration of 
antifibrinolytics in bleeding patients, it is rarely done.
From each enrolled subject, whole blood samples were 
collected in 2.7 mL evacuated tubes containing 3.2% sodium 
citrate on arrival in the emergency department, prior to the 
administration of blood products or antifibrinolytics. One 
sample was used for analysis with the Quantra QStat System 
and one sample was used in parallel for standard of care 
analysis on the ROTEM delta running the following assays: 
INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM. All ROTEM assays 
were run for 60 min and were analyzed according to the site’s 
normal protocols. For some patients, additional samples were 
taken after the administration of an antifibrinolytic or blood 
product if significant bleeding persisted and fibrinolysis was 
suspected.
The Quantra analyzers and the QStat Cartridges used in 
the study were labeled for Investigational Use Only (IUO). 
The results from Quantra analysis were blinded to the 
trauma clinical teams. Clinical decisions were based on each 
site’s standard of care and were not influenced by the study. 
Quantra analyzers were located either in a laboratory adja￾cent to the trauma emergency department/operating rooms 
or in a clinical research laboratory.
Data collection
For each enrolled subject, in addition to Quantra and ROTEM 
test results, the following information was documented in the 
study database: demographics: age, sex, race, ethnicity, height 
and weight; trauma information: reason for admittance to the 
hospital, type of injury, injury severity score based on the Revised 
Trauma Score (RTS); anticoagulant/antifibrinolytic medications 
taken prior to first test, if known; results of diagnostic tests 
performed within 30min of Quantra testing as part of the insti￾tution’s standard of care including platelet count, fibrinogen 
and hematocrit; blood loss recorded within 24hours of Quantra 
testing; and blood products and relevant therapies (antifibrino￾lytics and anticoagulants) administered within 24hours after 
Quantra testing.
Quantra QStat System
The Quantra QStat System is a cartridge-based VET device that 
measures changes in CS resulting from coagulation and fibrino￾lysis using ultrasound detection of resonance. A detailed descrip￾tion of the system and its operating principle is presented in refs 
20 21. The QStat Cartridge is the second single-use disposable 
developed for the Quantra platform, and it is intended for the 
management of patients with traumatic injury and in the periop￾erative setting of liver transplantation. The QStat Cartridge 
requires a whole blood sample collected in a 2.7mL citrated 
tube. The cartridge outputs five parameters: Clot Time (CT), 
Clot Stiffness (CS), Fibrinogen Contribution to clot stiffness 
(FCS), Platelet Contribution to clot stiffness (PCS) and Clot 
Stability to Lysis (CSL). The parameters CT, CS, FCS and PCS 
and their respective reference range intervals are the same as 
those previously described for the QPlus Cartridge.22 The CSL 
parameter is calculated as the normalized difference between the 
clot stiffness change after maximum clot stiffness in the absence 
of tranexamic acid and the corresponding clot stiffness change 
in the presence of tranexamic acid. The CSL reportable range 
extends from 100% (no fibrinolysis) to 10% (significant fibri￾nolysis). The reference range for CSL was estimated as between 
100% and 93% in a study of 43 healthy adult volunteers. A CSL 
value below the 93% threshold may indicate a reduction in clot 
stiffness caused by fibrinolysis. CSL is computed and reported as 
soon as fibrinolysis is detected.
Statistical analysis
Data analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4 or higher or R 
V.3.2.1 or higher (https://www.r-project.org/). Summary statis￾tics were determined for each of the Quantra and ROTEM test 
parameters combined by time point. The Pearson correlation test 
was used to demonstrate correlation between the Quantra and 
ROTEM test parameters. A simple linear regression model was 
used to evaluate the linear relationship between device measure￾ments: CT versus INTEM CT, CS versus EXTEM A20 and FCS 
versus FIBTEM A20. The strength of the concordance and the 
correlation (r value) was interpreted according to common defi￾nitions: 0.00–0.19: ‘very weak’, 0.20–0.39: ‘weak’, 0.40–0.59: 
‘moderate’, 0.60–0.79: ‘strong’ and 0.80–1.0: ‘very strong’.28
A clinical concordance analysis was performed using a 2×2 
confusion matrix to determine the agreement between the 
Quantra and ROTEM clot lysis parameters. As previously stated, 
for the Quantra QStat Cartridge, clot lysis was defined as posi￾tive if CSL was below the normal range threshold of 93%. For 
ROTEM, positive clot lysis was defined as EXTEM maximum 
lysis (ML) parameter >15% (determined at 60min).
RESULTS
A total of 56 adult trauma patients were enrolled in this multi￾center study. Patients demographics data are summarized in 
table 1. Thirty-five subjects had an RTS between 9 and 12; only 
five subjects had RTS in the lower category of 0–4. Blunt injuries 
accounted for 64.3% of the cases, penetrating injuries for 39.3% 
and neurological injuries for 32.1% (note that more than one 
injury type was recorded for some subjects).
Table 2 provides some basic summary statistics of the data 
from the Quantra and ROTEM delta devices on samples that

were tested in parallel. Forty-two per cent of samples had a low 
CS value suggestive of an hypocoagulable state. The low stiff￾ness values could be attributed to either low platelet contribu￾tion (PCS), low fibrinogen contribution (FCS), or a combination 
of the two. Fewer samples analyzed on standard ROTEM assays 
showed evidence of low clot stiffness based on low EXTEM and 
FIBTEM A20 results and hyperfibrinolysis based on EXTEM 
ML results.
Fibrinolysis concordance analysis
Eight samples (13.3%) had a QStat CSL value below the reference 
range threshold of 93%, indicating the presence of hyperfibrino￾lysis. Conversely, only five samples (8.2%) had an EXTEM ML at 
60min greater than 15%. Table 3 summarizes the results of the 
concordance analysis between the Quantra CSL and the ROTEM 
EXTEM ML for the detection of hyperfibrinolysis. Note that for 
one of the samples determined to be fibrinolysis positive based on 
CSL <93%, there was no corresponding EXTEM ML reported, 
thus this sample was excluded from analysis.
Table 3 indicates that overall, for 96.6% of samples, QStat 
and ROTEM results were in agreement with each other with 
respect identifying fibrinolysis positive and fibrinolysis negative 
samples. One of the two subjects identified as fibrinolysis posi￾tive by the Quantra but not by the ROTEM had a CSL value 
of 92%, just below the cut-off value of 93%; the second was a 
patient that received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior 
to sample collection and analysis.
Figure 1 shows the QStat dials and curves generated on arrival 
to the emergency room and after the administration of antifibri￾nolytics. Significant hyperfibrinolysis is observed on arrival as 
indicated by a CSL value of 10%. After administration of TXA, 
CSL returns within the normal reference range.
Correlation analysis
The results of the linear regression analysis are summarized 
in figure 2, which shows the scatter plots of the three paired 
QStat and ROTEM parameters: CS versus EXTEM A20, FCS 
versus FIBTEM A20 and CT versus INTEM CT, respectively. 
For these analyses, the ROTEM measurements of clot amplitude 
were converted from millimeters (mm) to units of shear modulus 
(Pascals) before performing regression analysis.29 30
These data demonstrate a strong correlation between QPlus 
parameters and corresponding ROTEM delta parameters, although 
in the presence of an inherent bias associated with the differences in 
measurement principles. As previously discussed with respect to the

QPlus parameters, the bias does not introduce concerns regarding 
the comparison of these devices since measured results are inter￾preted in relation to the respective reference intervals.22
Although not shown here, the correlation between CSL and 
EXTEM ML had an r value of 0.95, thus indicating a very strong 
correlation in addition to high concordance between the two 
measurements.
DISCUSSION
This manuscript describes the first clinical experience with 
the Quantra and the QStat Cartridge in adult trauma patients 
requiring the highest level of trauma activation. It also intro￾duces the CSL, a new parameter generated via viscoelastic 
analysis of fibrinolysis with the Quantra System. The results 
of this observational multicenter study showed strong correla￾tion and strong concordance of QStat parameters with equiva￾lent metrics obtained from the ROTEM delta, the standard of 
care at the level I trauma centers participating in the study. VET 
with goal-directed treatment algorithm is recommended, when 
such testing capabilities are available, by several clinical guide￾lines for the management of massive bleeding and coagulopa￾thies in trauma patients. These include the American College of 
Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program and the most 
recent European guideline on management of major bleeding 
and coagulopathy following trauma.11 31
The comparative data obtained with the QStat parameters CT, 
CS and FCS versus ROTEM are in agreement with the results 
previously presented in studies in cardiac and major orthopedic 
surgeries using the QPlus Cartridge.22–26 Notwithstanding the 
strong correlation between the two systems, the Quantra-based 
stiffness results demonstrated a higher number of samples with 
values below the respective reference ranges as compared with 
the ROTEM delta. Interestingly, the main contributor to a low 
Quantra CS value was a low PCS value, highlighting the potential 
importance of an indicator of platelet contribution to clot stiffness 
(note that the correlation of PCS with platelet count was moderate 
with r value of 0.54, data not shown).
The data presented here demonstrated that the CSL param￾eter had a very strong overall agreement with the EXTEM ML 
parameter even though only a few patients experienced hyperfi￾brinolysis. The ROTEM EXTEM ML is a dynamic parameter 
that measures the per cent clot firmness lost after maximum clot 
firmness. Although this parameter is routinely used as part of goal￾directed treatment algorithms in the trauma and liver transplant 
populations, for example, there is no reference range interval, nor 
an approved threshold value provided by the manufacturer. Based 
on several published studies in civilian and military trauma, clinical 
practice has converged to the definition of hyperfibrinolysis as a 
reduction in MCF of greater than 15% (ML >15%) 60min after 
the onset of clot formation.18 32–35 Lang et al36 performed a multi￾center study on adult normal subjects (n=150) and reported an 
EXTEM ML reference interval of 0%–18%, thus in line with the 
clinically used cut-off value of 15%.
Furthermore, the Quantra identified a higher number of 
samples categorized as ‘fibrinolysis positive’ (ie, with values 
below the CSL threshold) as compared with the ROTEM delta. 
The two discordant observations include a sample just below the 
CSL threshold (CSL of 92% and corresponding EXTEM ML of 
9%) and a sample from a patient undergoing CPR that gener￾ated a CSL value of 57%, indicating significant hyperfibrinolysis

a different color and a warning sign. As expected, after the administration of antifibrinolytics, the QStat CSL parameter returns within the normal 
range from an initial value of 10% indicating significant clot dissolution (as also confirmed from the corresponding curves). CSL, Clot Stability to Lysis;

but a corresponding EXTEM ML of 2%. While the reason for 
this significant difference between the two systems is currently 
unclear, we hypothesize that out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 
longer CPR times may be associated with higher incidence of 
hyperfibrinolysis.37
The CSL is a new Quantra-based parameter that was designed 
to quantify the reduction in clot stiffness caused by fibrinolysis. 
The computation of CSL is based on a differential test strategy 
with and without tranexamic acid, therefore mitigating the 
effects of clot relaxation, often observed in viscoelastic testing 
systems as a reduction in clot stiffness not attributable to fibrino￾lysis but to the interactions between platelets and fibrinogen with 
the walls of the measuring chambers. A similar approach can be 
implemented with the ROTEM delta combining the EXTEM 
test (no inhibitor of fibrinolysis) and the APTEM test, which 
inhibits fibrinolysis using aprotinin. However, the majority of 
ROTEM-based treatment algorithms do not typically rely on the 
APTEM/EXTEM ML differential. Furthermore, looking at the 
FIBTEM curve for evidence of fibrinolysis, as plasmin cleaves 
fibrin, demonstrates further confirmation of true fibrinolysis.38
The QStat FCS curve provided similar evidence of fibrinolysis.
Another difference with respect to other VET platforms is that 
CSL is not calculated at fixed time points, such as in the case of 
the TEG LY30 or LY60 parameters or the ROTEM ML at 60min, 
but instead it is computed and reported as soon as fibrinolysis is 
detected. In this study, CSL was computed, on average, within 
44.2min from test initiation (SD of 9.7min), with a minimum 
value of 11.6min recorded in one of the samples with the lowest 
CSL values. An earlier indication of CSL coupled with the ability 
to run the test near point-of-care may provide the clinician clini￾cally important information sooner to guide therapy.
Finally, it is important to note that CSL is based on the 
direct measurement of shear modulus, measured in hectoPas￾cals, which offers a larger available measurement range than 
the corresponding clot amplitude in units of mm. As previously 
demonstrated, the relationship between shear modulus and clot 
amplitude is non-linear, with larger values of shear modulus 
being compressed more in millimeters.22 30 This means that small 
relative changes in mm from a high clot stiffness represent large 
changes in shear modulus, which should be readily measured by 
CSL.
The study had several limitations that need to be considered. 
First, the number of enrolled patients was limited and, in partic￾ular, the number of hyperfibrinolytic samples/patients was small. 
Furthermore, even though the ROTEM was used as the compar￾ator in this study, there is no widely accepted gold-standard test/
assay for the diagnosis of fibrinolysis. The study was observa￾tional; therefore, the actual impact of the Quantra QStat System 
on patient care remains unknown and should be investigated 
in the future through interventional studies. Finally, interpre￾tation of the strength of the correlation of the Quantra versus 
ROTEM was based on the definitions presented by Schober et 
al28 as previously utilized by Huffmyer et al23 and Naik et al,
25
among others, even though we recognize that other definitions 
with different thresholds exist.
In conclusion, these results support the use of the Quantra 
QStat System as an aid to monitor coagulation and fibrinolysis 
status in the trauma population. The ability to perform testing 
at the point of care, the ability to generate fast results and the 
closed tube handling of blood samples may provide additional 
clinical advantages and safety considerations over existing 
devices. However, additional studies are needed to fully char￾acterize the performance of the system and its ability to affect 
patient care.
