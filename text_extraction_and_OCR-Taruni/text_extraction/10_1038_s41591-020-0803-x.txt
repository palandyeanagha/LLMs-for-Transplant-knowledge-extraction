People with obesity commonly face a pervasive, resilient form of social stigma. They are often subject to discrimination in the 
workplace as well as in educational and healthcare settings. Research indicates that weight stigma can cause physical and psy￾chological harm, and that affected individuals are less likely to receive adequate care. For these reasons, weight stigma dam￾ages health, undermines human and social rights, and is unacceptable in modern societies. To inform healthcare professionals, 
policymakers, and the public about this issue, a multidisciplinary group of international experts, including representatives of 
scientific organizations, reviewed available evidence on the causes and harms of weight stigma and, using a modified Delphi 
process, developed a joint consensus statement with recommendations to eliminate weight bias. Academic institutions, profes￾sional organizations, media, public-health authorities, and governments should encourage education about weight stigma to 
facilitate a new public narrative about obesity, coherent with modern scientific knowledge.

Consensus Statement NATuRe MeDicine
general. Weight stigma can cause considerable harm to affected 
individuals, including physical and psychological consequences. 
The damaging impact of weight stigma, however, extends beyond 
harm to individuals. The prevailing view that obesity is a choice and 
that it can be entirely reversed by voluntary decisions to eat less and 
exercise more can exert negative influences on public health poli￾cies, access to treatments, and research1–3
.
Although raising awareness of the negative consequences of 
weight stigma is important, awareness alone is not sufficient 
to eliminate the issue. Challenging and changing widespread, 
deep-rooted beliefs, longstanding preconceptions, and prevailing 
mindsets requires a new public narrative of obesity that is coher￾ent with modern scientific knowledge. Given the pervasiveness 
of societal weight bias, this goal can only be achieved through 
the concerted efforts of a broad group of stakeholders, including 
healthcare providers (HCPs), researchers, the media, policymak￾ers, and patients.
To best inform HCPs, policymakers, and the public about stigma 
associated with obesity, a multi-disciplinary group of international 
experts, including representatives of ten scientific organizations 
(Table 1), reviewed available evidence on the causes and harms of 
weight stigma, developing a joint consensus statement with recom￾mendations to eliminate weight bias.
A specific goal—representing novelty from previous related 
initiatives—was to address the gap between stigmatizing narra￾tives around obesity and current scientific knowledge regarding 
mechanisms of body-weight regulation. The overarching objective 
was to gather a broad group of experts and scientific organizations

to recognize the problem and, to our knowledge for the first time, 
‘speak with one voice’ about this important issue.
Here we report the conclusions of this exercise and resulting 
joint consensus statements, with a call to action for all stakeholders 
to take a pledge (Box 1) to end weight stigma and discrimination.
Methodology
Partner organizations and selection of voting delegates. The 
consensus-development conference was convened by F.R. (con￾ference director), jointly with the following partner organizations: 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American 
Association for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, American 
Diabetes Association, Diabetes UK, European Association for 
the Study of Obesity, International Federation for the Surgery 
of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, Obesity Action Coalition, 
Obesity Canada, The Obesity Society, and World Obesity 
Federation.
The conference director (F.R.), co-chairs (D.E.C., D.H.R., and 
J.B.D.), and the partner organizations appointed a multidisciplinary 
expert panel (Table 1) of 36 internationally recognized academics 
representing multiple scientific disciplines, including endocrinol￾ogy, nutrition, internal medicine, surgery, psychology, molecular 
biology, cardiology, gastroenterology, primary care, public health, 
and health policy. The expert panel also included patient-advo￾cacy experts, plus an individual with obesity to speak on behalf of 
patients. Given that the main aim of this consensus conference was 
not to define weight stigma or assess it from an ethical perspective, 
we did not include ethicists in the expert panel.
The 36 members of the expert panel, who constituted voting 
delegates for the entire consensus-development process, were 
selected primarily from academics with documented exper￾tise about the topics of the conference and relevant publication 
records. Each of the ten partner societies used their own criteria to 
choose their representatives for the expert panel. Criteria included, 
expertise in weight stigma, obesity, and/or previous participation 
in relevant committees or initiatives related to weight stigma. One 
independent, non-voting moderator (O.B.C.) with previous expe￾rience in Delphi methodology administered questionnaires for the 
modified Delphi process and chaired the face-to-face meeting of 
voting delegates.
Review of evidence. A subgroup of expert panel members (F.R., 
D.E.C., and J.B.D.) contributed to a review of scientific publications 
in Medline on a broad set of topics related to weight bias, stigma, and 
discrimination. Specific, preset research questions for the review of 
evidence included: (i) prevalence of weight bias and stigma (in the 
media, healthcare, education, and workplace); (ii) psychologically 
and physically harmful effects on individuals; (iii) impact on access 
to care and research, and evidence of workplace weight discrimina￾tion; (iv) biological mechanisms of weight regulation in physiology 
and disease; (v) clinical evidence of uptake and barriers to access of 
available treatments; and (vi) mechanisms of body-weight regula￾tion and energy homeostasis. We also searched broader data sources 
for references to weight discrimination in current legislation.
Members of the expert panel with specific expertise (R.M.P., 
C.A., L.J.A., D.H.R., T.J.R., and S.W.F.) were also tasked to inde￾pendently conduct a short narrative review of current knowledge 
on one of the above research questions, according to their specific 
expertise.
Given the objectives of the consensus conference, the diversity 
of the subjects under consideration, and the variance in quality of 
evidence across disciplines, we considered a broad evidence base, 
including previously published systematic reviews, and various 
types of observational studies, experimental medicine, and trans￾lational studies in animals (weight-regulation mechanisms). For 
evidence about media portrayal of obesity, we used a 2010 review 
based on PsycINFO database searches using weight bias and stigma￾tization-related terms and phrases to identify journal articles pub￾lished in English between 1994 and 2009 (ref. 4
). We also identified 
papers related to these subjects in Medline published between 2011 
and 2019. To assess beliefs about obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related 
treatment options, we used research surveys and pools of opinion 
conducted among HCPs and/or the general public, and reported 
in Medline.
A document with the results of this review was circulated among 
the rest of the group in preparation for the modified Delphi process, 
seeking further input.
Delphi-like consensus-development process. Based on results of 
the review of evidence, a subgroup of expert panel members with 
special expertise in specific subtopics developed questionnaires, 
including a set of statements and recommendations that were 
believed to summarize and reflect available evidence. These ques￾tionnaires were then circulated among the expert panel. An online 
Delphi-like method was used to measure the degree of consensus for 
the statements and recommendations by a web-based survey tool 
(SurveyMonkey; https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk). We adapted 
the original Delphi method5
 to the scopes and nature of this exer￾cise. Unlike other Delphi studies, in which the first round consists 
mainly of open-ended questions, we used agree/disagree questions 
designed by a subgroup of members of the expert panel (F.R., S.W.F., 
D.E.C., and J.B.D.) for the first round.
Approximately three weeks before the survey was first admin￾istered, we informed potential participants of the objectives of the 
Box 1 | Pledge to eliminate weight bias and stigma of obesity
We recognize that
•	 Individuals affected by overweight and obesity face a 
pervasive form of social stigma based on the typically 
unproven assumption that their body weight derives primar￾ily from a lack self-discipline and personal responsibility.
•	 Such portrayal is inconsistent with current scientific evidence 
demonstrating that body-weight regulation is not entirely 
under volitional control, and that biological, genetic, and 
environmental factors critically contribute to obesity.
•	 Weight bias and stigma can result in discrimination, and 
undermine human rights, social rights, and the health of 
afflicted individuals.
•	 Weight stigma and discrimination cannot be tolerated in 
modern societies.
We condemn
•	 The use of stigmatizing language, images, attitudes, policies, 
and weight-based discrimination, wherever they occur.
We pledge
•	 To treat individuals with overweight and obesity with dignity 
and respect.
•	 To refrain from using stereotypical language, images, and 
narratives that unfairly and inaccurately depict individuals 
with overweight and obesity as lazy, gluttonous, and lacking 
willpower or self-discipline.
•	 To encourage and support educational initiatives aimed at 
eradicating weight bias through dissemination of current 
knowledge of obesity and body-weight regulation.
•	 To encourage and support initiatives aimed at prevent￾ing weight discrimination in the workplace, education, and 
healthcare settings.

Consensus Statement NATuRe MeDicine
Table 2 | Consensus statements on the stigma of obesity
Item Topic Grade
1. Prevalence of weight stigma and weight-based discrimination
1. 1 A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that weight-based stigma is extremely pervasive among people of 
diverse ages and backgrounds.
A
1.2. People with obesity are often subject to unfair treatment and discrimination in the workplace, education, and 
healthcare settings.
U
1.3. Weight-based discrimination is one of the most common forms of discrimination in modern societies. A
1.4. Women are more likely to suffer weight-based discrimination compared to men; this has the potential to contribute 
to inequalities in employment and education.
A
2. Weight stigma and the media
2.1 Media portrayal of obesity is influential; it plays an important role in shaping public attitudes and beliefs about 
people with obesity and related diseases.
U
2.2 In news media, obesity is frequently attributed to personal responsibility, and afflicted individuals are often 
represented—without evidence—as being lazy, gluttonous, and lacking will power and self-discipline.
U
2.3 Media portrayals of diet and exercise as the only appropriate therapies for obesity are scientifically inaccurate and 
may deter patients from pursuing additional evidence-based interventions.
U
2.4 Media portrayals that encourage weight-based stigma and discrimination are harmful and should be discouraged. U
3. Weight stigma in healthcare
3.1 Many healthcare professionals hold negative attitudes about obesity, including stereotypes that affected patients are 
lazy, lack self-control and willpower, are personally to blame for their weight, and are noncompliant with treatment.
A
3.2 Weight-based stigma among healthcare professional is unacceptable, especially among those who are specialized 
in the care of people with obesity.
A
3.3 Many healthcare facilities are inadequately equipped to treat patients with obesity. U
4. Weight-based discrimination
4.1 Obesity stigmatization and discrimination occur in schools, such that children and adolescents living with obesity 
are at an increased risk for poor peer relations and experience high rates of bullying.
A
4.2 Weight-based stigma unfairly undermines opportunities for employment, career progression, and income for people 
with obesity.
A
4.3 For most people with obesity who experience discrimination in recruitment or in the workplace, there is no legal 
protection under current legislation.
A
5. Physical and mental health consequences
5.1 Weight-based stigma and internalized weight bias can be particularly harmful to mental health, increasing risks of 
depressive symptoms, anxiety, and promoting lower self-esteem, social isolation, stress, and substance use.
U
5.2 Adults and children who experience weight-based stigma are more likely to avoid exercise and physical activity, and 
to engage in unhealthy diets and sedentary behaviors that increase the risk of worsening obesity.
A
6. Quality of care, access to care
6.1. Quality of health care is adversely affected by weight-based stigma. U
6.2 Fear of prejudice and internalized weight bias cause direct and indirect harm to patients with obesity, as they are 
less likely to seek and receive appropriate treatment for obesity or other conditions.
A
6.3. Despite the well-recognized risks of obesity and related illnesses, it is common for health insurance companies 
to have significant limitations or complete lack of coverage for evidence-based treatments of obesity—especially 
metabolic surgery. These policies can cause harm, are indefensible, and are ethically objectionable.
A
7. Weight stigma and public health
7.1 Despite significant evidence that weight-based stigma causes damage to individuals and society, public health 
efforts to date have not widely addressed stigma as a barrier to combat the obesity epidemic.
A
7.2 Stigmatizing public health campaigns that emphasize the role of personal responsibility and ‘healthy lifestyle’ 
choices focusing only on nutrition and physical activity overlook important societal and environmental factors that 
critically contribute to the epidemic of obesity.
A
7.3 Some public health campaigns appear to embrace stigmatization of individuals with obesity as a means to 
motivate behavior change and achieve weight loss through self-directed diet and increased physical exercise. These 
approaches are not supported by scientific evidence, and they risk further increasing societal discrimination against 
people with obesity, yielding the opposite to the intended effect.
A
8. Weight stigma and research
8.1 Misconceptions about the causes of obesity are likely to play an important part in public support for obesity 
research and relative allocation of public funding, compared to other diseases that are believed not to depend on 
factors completely controllable by individuals’ actions (for example, cancer, infectious diseases, etc.).

study, provided information about the Delphi process, and invited 
them to contribute. Participants were assured that responses were 
confidential, with individual responses known only to the impartial, 
non-voting survey moderator.
The moderator administered the questionnaires through two 
rounds of Delphi-like process. Delegates who did not agree with the 
proposed statements were asked to state their reasons and propose 
amendments. A further (third) round of Delphi was administered 
after the in-person meeting. All questions also contained a box for 
individual, non-compulsory comments.
Each survey round was conducted over two weeks: one week for 
response acquisition (including e-mail reminders before the clos￾ing date), and one week for data analysis and preparation of the 
subsequent round. A personalized email message was sent to each 
respondent with a URL link to the survey.
Response rate for both of the first two Delphi rounds was 34/36 
expert panel members, and all 36 members responded in the third 
Delphi round.
In-person consensus meeting. Supporting evidence and draft con￾clusions generated through the Delphi process were presented at the 
4th World Congress on Interventional Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes 
2019 (WCITD2019, New York, 10 April, 2019). Proceedings were 
open to public comment by other experts in the field (WCITD2019 
faculty members) and by the entire audience through opinion polls, 
using real-time electronic voting (Turning Technology software). 
On 10 April 10, 2019, voting delegates met face-to-face to review, 
amend, and vote on each consensus statement.
Final steps. After the meeting in New York, the document with 
conclusions reached by the experts underwent a final review and 
approval through a third round of Delphi process.
The final consensus document, including the ‘Pledge to 
Eliminate Weight Bias and Stigma of Obesity’ (Box 1), was then sub￾mitted to the scientific committees and executive boards of partner 
organizations and other stakeholders for review and endorsement. 
A subgroup of the expert panel (F.R., R.M.P., D.E.C., R.H.E., D.H.R., 
J.I.M., J.N., X.R.S., P.R.S., D.T., and J.B.D.) generated the first draft 
of the report. The draft report was then circulated among all other 
members of the expert panel for further input and approval before 
submission for publication.
All members of the expert panel, all partner organizations, and 
additional organizations listed in Box 2 have formally endorsed the 
statement and taken the pledge to eliminate weight stigma.

8.2. Diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes receive far less research funding than do other chronic diseases, 
relative to their prevalence and the costs they impose upon society.
A
9. Causes and contributors of weight stigma/discrimination
9.1 Causal attributions of personal responsibility for obesity are associated with stronger weight bias, whereas lower 
levels of weight-based stigma are associated with stronger beliefs in genetic/physiological or environmental causes 
of obesity.
U
9.2 The absence of policies to prohibit weight discrimination communicates a message that weight stigma is acceptable 
and tolerable, thus reinforcing weight-based inequities.
A
9.3 The idea that the causes of obesity depend on individuals’ faults, such as laziness and gluttony, provides the 
foundation for stigma against obesity.
A
10. The science of obesity versus misconceptions in the public narrative of obesity
10.1 The assumption that body weight is entirely under volitional control, and that voluntarily eating less and/or 
exercising more can entirely prevent or reverse obesity is at odds with a definitive body of biological and clinical 
evidence developed over the last several decades.
U
10.2 Popular expressions such as ‘energy in versus energy out’ or ‘calories in versus calories out’ are misleading because 
they inaccurately imply that body weight and/or fat mass are solely influenced by the number of food calories 
ingested, and the amount of energy burned through exercise. This narrative is not supported by evidence and 
provides a foundation for popular, stigmatizing views that blame individuals’ lack of willpower for their obesity.
A
10.3 The idea that obesity is a ‘choice’ is a misconception, inconsistent with both logic and scientific evidence showing 
that obesity results primarily from a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.
A
10.4 There is a widespread assumption, including among many medical professionals, that voluntary lifestyle changes 
(diet and exercise) can entirely reverse obesity over long periods of time, even when severe. This assumption runs 
contrary to indisputable scientific evidence demonstrating that voluntary efforts to reduce body weight activate 
potent compensatory biologic responses (for example, increased appetite, decreased metabolic rate) that typically 
promote long-term weight regain.
A
10.5 Metabolic surgery is not an ‘easy way out’ but an evidence-based, physiologic approach to treating obesity and type 
2 diabetes, given its ability to influence underlying mechanisms of energy and glucose homeostasis.
A
11. Obesity: ‘condition’ or ‘disease’?
11.1 There is objective evidence that in many patients, obesity presents the typical attributions of a disease status, which 
include specific signs and/or symptoms, distinct pathophysiology, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of 
complications/mortality.
U
11.2 Although prevailing evidence supports a rationale for obesity to be defined as a disease, as recognized by leading 
worldwide authority bodies and medical associations, current diagnostic criteria for obesity (only based on BMI 
levels) are inadequate to accurately diagnose obesity.

NATuRe MeDicine Consensus Statement
was iteratively modified to maximize agreement, and the degree 
of consensus for each statement was graded according to the fol￾lowing scale: grade U was 100% agreement (unanimous); grade A 
was 90–99% agreement; grade B was 78–89% agreement; and grade 
C was 67–77% agreement. This grading scale is meant to indicate 
statements that reflect unanimous or near-unanimous opinions 
(grades U and A), strong agreement with little variance (grade B), 
or a consensus statement that reflects an averaging of more and pos￾sibly extremely diverse opinions (grade C). All statements included 
in this consensus document achieved either grades U or A, which 
we report for each statement.
The first questionnaire asked 58 questions, including six on 
expert panel demographic information. During the three Delphi￾like rounds and the in-person voting session, the expert panel elimi￾nated five consensus questions that were deemed to be duplicative 
or redundant. Our iterative changes throughout the process yielded 
47 final statements (Tables 2 and 3), all with >89% consensus 
(grades A and U), as summarized in Box 3.
In this document, we use the terms ‘weight stigma’, ‘weight-based 
stereotypes’, or ‘weight bias’ to refer to biases against individuals 
with overweight and obesity, not underweight. We provide defini￾tions in Box 4.
Summary of evidence
Prevalence of weight bias, stigma, and discrimination. Substantial 
research has demonstrated that weight stigma and discrimination 
are pervasive, global issues7,8
. Weight stigma has been documented 
in multiple societal domains, including the workplace, education, 
healthcare settings, and within families9,10. Stigma has persisted 
despite the markedly increased prevalence of obesity in recent 
decades. Among adults with obesity, the prevalence of weight dis￾crimination is 19–42%, with higher rates among those with higher 
body-mass index (BMI), and among women compared with men11–13.
Estimates from a 2018 study suggest that approximately 40–50% 
of US adults with overweight and obesity experience internalized 
weight bias, and about 20% of US adults experience this at high lev￾els14. Internalized weight bias is present in individuals across diverse 
body-weight categories, but especially among individuals with 
higher BMI who are trying to lose weight14.
Evidence suggests that the media is a pervasive source of weight 
bias and can reinforce stigma through the use of inaccurate framing 
of obesity and inappropriate images, language, and terminology that 
attribute obesity entirely to personal responsibility15. It has been esti￾mated that over two thirds of images accompanying US media reports 
of obesity contain weight stigma, and experimental studies show that 
viewing these types of images leads to increased weight bias16.
Weight bias has been reported among HCPs in the United 
States and around the world, including among primary care pro￾viders, endocrinologists, cardiologists, nurses, dietitians, mental 
health professionals, medical trainees, and professionals engaged in 
research and clinical management of obesity17,18.
Physical and mental health consequences of weight stigma.
Children with overweight and obesity are frequently subject to 
weight-based teasing and bullying at school. Compared with stu￾dents of lower body weight, adolescents with overweight or obesity 
are significantly more likely to experience social isolation19–21 and 
are at increased risk for relational, verbal, cyber, and physical vic￾timization22. They are also more susceptible to developing mental 
health disorders, especially anxiety and depression, in addition to 
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in later life23.
Weight stigma, rather than obesity itself, may be particularly 
harmful to mental health and is associated with depressive symp￾toms, higher anxiety levels, lower self-esteem, social isolation, 
perceived stress, substance use24–26, unhealthy eating and weight￾control behaviors, such as binge eating and emotional overeat￾ing27. Experimental studies also show, paradoxically, that exposing 
individuals to weight stigma can lead to increased food intake, 
regardless of BMI3,28. Correlative and randomized-controlled 
studies also show that experience of weight stigma is linked with 
lower levels of physical activity, higher exercise avoidance29–31, 
consumption of unhealthy diets, and increased sedentary behav￾iors1–3
, as well as increased obesity and weight gain over time32, 
and increased risk of transitioning from overweight to obesity in 
both adults and adolescents33–35.

26 February 2020 (continued)
Box 3 | Executive summary
(Grade of consensus (GoC): U is unanimous; A is >90% 
consensus)
Weight stigma is reinforced by misconceived ideas about 
body-weight regulation and lack of awareness of current 
scientific evidence. Weight stigma is unacceptable in modern 
societies, as it undermines human rights, social rights, and the 
health of afflicted individuals (GoC: A).
Research indicates that weight stigma can cause significant 
harm to affected individuals. Individuals who experience it suffer 
from both physical and psychological consequences, and are less 
likely to seek and receive adequate care (GoC: U).
Despite scientific evidence to the contrary, the prevailing 
view in society is that obesity is a choice that can be reversed 
by voluntary decisions to eat less and exercise more. These 
assumptions mislead public health policies, confuse messages in 
popular media, undermine access to evidence-based treatments, 
and compromise advances in research (GoC: A).
For the reasons above, weight stigma represents a major 
obstacle in efforts to effectively prevent and treat obesity and 
type 2 diabetes. Tackling stigma is not only a matter of human 
rights and social justice, but also a way to advance prevention 
and treatment of these diseases (GoC: A).
Academic institutions, professional organizations, media, 
public health authorities, and government should encourage 
education about weight stigma and facilitate a new public 
narrative of obesity, coherent with modern scientific knowledge 
(GoC: U).

Consensus Statement NATuRe MeDicine
Individuals with overweight and obesity who experience weight 
discrimination show higher levels of circulating C-reactive pro￾tein36, cortisol37, long-term cardio-metabolic risk38, and increased 
mortality39 compared with those who do not experienced weight 
discrimination.
Quality of care and health care utilization. Evidence suggests that 
physicians spend less time in appointments and provide less edu￾cation about health to patients with obesity compared with thin￾ner patients17, and patients who report having experienced weight 
bias in the healthcare setting have poor treatment outcomes40 and 
might be more likely to avoid future care41. Obesity also adversely 
impacts age-appropriate cancer screening, which can lead to delays 
in breast, gynecological, and colorectal cancer detection42.
A thematic analysis of 21 studies examined the perceptions of 
weight bias and its impact on engagement with primary health 
care services43. Negative influences on engagement with primary 
care were evaluated and ten themes were identified: contemp￾tuous, patronizing, and disrespectful treatment, lack of train￾ing, ambivalence, attribution of all health issues to excess weight, 
assumptions about weight gain, barriers to health care utilization, 
expectation of differential health care treatment, low trust and poor 
communication, avoidance or delay of health services, and seeking 
medical advice from multiple HCPs.
The widespread, but unproven, assumption that body weight 
is entirely controllable by lifestyle choices and that self-directed 
efforts can reverse even severe forms of obesity or type 2 diabe￾tes44 could explain the low level of public support for coverage 
of anti-obesity interventions beyond diet and exercise45, regard￾less of their evidence base. For example, many public and private 
health insurers either do not provide coverage or have substan￾tive limitations in the coverage of metabolic surgery, including 
fulfilment of a number of criteria for which there is limited or 
no clinical evidence46,47. These attitudes are in stark contrast with 
coverage of treatment for other chronic diseases (for example, 
cancer, heart disease, and osteoarthritis) that are not conditional 
to similar restrictions, and for which use of similarly arbitrary 
coverage criteria would be socially indefensible and ethically 
objectionable.
Stigmatization of surgical treatment for obesity. Metabolic sur￾gery (also known as bariatric surgery) provides a compelling exam￾ple of how weight stigma can also extend to treatments for obesity. 
Compared with individuals who lose weight using diet and exercise

alone, those who lose weight through metabolic surgery can be at 
risk of stronger stigma because they are stereotyped as being lazy 
and being less responsible for their weight loss48,49. It is not surpris￾ing that many hide their surgical status49.
Despite evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness50,51 of surgical 
interventions for obesity, only 0.1–2% of surgical candidates who 
qualify worldwide currently undergo such surgery52. A research 
survey in the United States showed that only 19.2% of responders 
supported insurance coverage of metabolic operations45.
Weight stigma and public health policies. Historical examples of 
illnesses whose social construction incorporated moral judgments 
about the role of individuals’ actions in contracting the disease (for 
example, plague, cholera, syphilis, HIV/AIDS), demonstrate that 
stigma can interfere with public heath efforts to control epidemics53. 
These examples also highlight the importance of initiatives aimed 
at combatting stigma and social exclusion (for example, United 
Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS and 2002–
2003 World AIDS Campaign)54.
Public health efforts to date have typically neglected stigma as a 
barrier in efforts to address obesity. By contrast, some public health 
strategies openly embrace stigmatization of individuals with obesity, 
based on the assumption that shame will motivate them to change 
behavior and achieve weight loss through a self-directed diet and 
increased physical exercise55. Both observational and randomized￾controlled studies show that these strategies can result in the oppo￾site effect, and may instead induce exercise avoidance, consumption 
of unhealthy diets, and increased sedentary behaviors1–3
, leading to 
poor metabolic health, increased weight gain56,57, and reduced qual￾ity of life57.
Some public health messages and government-supported anti￾obesity campaigns also characterize the merits of prevention of 
obesity as a preferable alternative to treatments for established 
obesity, such as pharmacotherapy or surgery, which are often con￾sidered more expensive. This is a misconception, as it frames pre￾vention and treatment as being mutually exclusive, whereas these 
approaches should generally be directed toward two distinct popu￾lations, with different needs.
Discrimination in employment. Workplace discrimination against 
individuals with overweight and obesity is common in high-income 
countries58. Individuals with obesity have reported receiving lower 
starting salaries, can be ranked as less qualified, and can work lon￾ger hours than do thinner employees59. Persons with obesity can be 
perceived to be less suitable for employment and are less likely to be 
invited for an interview60, or, if employed, are perceived to be less 
successful compared with thinner peers61. Women with obesity are 
the especially unlikely to be hired62.
A UK study of 119,669 individuals aged 37−73 years found a 
strong association between higher BMI and lower socioeconomic 
status, especially in women63. Similarly, a US study reported 
that overweight women are more likely to work in lower-paying 
jobs and make less money compared with average-size women 
and all men64.
For the vast majority of individuals with obesity who experience 
discrimination in recruitment or the workplace, there is gener￾ally no protection under current legislations62. Although some US 
states have recently introduced a legislation that protects against 
height and weight discrimination65, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
does not identify weight as a protected characteristic, and only in 
some instances a condition of very high BMI can meet the defini￾tion of disability under a 2008 amendment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act legislation66. This amendment, however, does not 
cover individuals who are not disabled, even though they can also 
be victims of weight discrimination.
Similarly, in 2014 the European Court of Justice ruled that being 
severely overweight could be considered a disability if this condi￾tion disrupts an employee’s ability to work. However, obesity per se 
is generally not specified as a disabling condition in current EU 
employment law; hence, most anti-discrimination laws require 
interpretation of whether a person with obesity has a disability. The 
UK Equality Act (2010)67 specifically prohibits discrimination on 
the grounds of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and 
civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, ethnicity, religion or 
belief, sex, and sexual orientation—but not for obesity.
Weight bias and research. Research into obesity and diabetes is 
underfunded compared with other diseases, relative to their bur￾den and costs on society. For example, the US National Institutes 
of Health’s projected budgets for cancer, HIV/AIDS, and digestive 
diseases are 5–10 times greater than the budget for obesity, despite 
that the latter affecting substantially more Americans.
Among the 5,623 participants in a recent multi-national 
research survey (the ASK study), higher weight stigma was asso￾ciated with lower prioritization of spending on obesity research44. 
There are also several ways in which stigma can hinder support 
of research and scientific advances. For instance, oversimplified 
notion that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too 
little, implies that the causes of obesity and its epidemic are well￾understood, and not complex. In this context, research designed to 
elucidate etiologic mechanisms of obesity may not be perceived as 
a priority. Furthermore, funding could be skewed toward projects 
that are anticipated to be effective (that is, implementation of behav￾ior and lifestyle interventions), reducing support for investigation 
of novel methods of prevention and treatment or implementation 
of available evidence-based therapies (that is, pharmaceutical or 
surgical approaches).
Causes and contributors for weight stigma. Evidence from sev￾eral countries68–71 shows that when individuals attribute the causes 
of obesity primarily to internal, controllable factors or personal 
choices, they exhibit higher weight bias, whereas acknowledging 
the complex causes of obesity (including elements such as genetics, 
biology, and environmental factors) is associated with lower levels of 
weight bias and less blame. These findings suggest that the prevail￾ing narrative of obesity in news coverage, public health campaigns, 
and political discourse—centered heavily on notions of personal 
Box 4 | Definitions
Weight stigma refers to social devaluation and denigration of 
individuals because of their excess body weight, and can lead to 
negative attitudes, stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.
Weight-based stereotypes include generalizations that 
individuals with overweight or obesity are lazy, gluttonous, lacking 
in willpower and self-discipline, incompetent, unmotivated to 
improve their health, non-compliant with medical treatment, 
and are personally to blame for their higher body weight.
Weight discrimination refers to overt forms of weight-based 
prejudice and unfair treatment (biased behaviors) toward 
individuals with overweight or obesity.
Weight bias internalization occurs when individuals engage 
in self-blame and self-directed weight stigma because of their 
weight. Internalization includes agreement with stereotypes and 
application of these stereotypes to oneself and self-devaluation6
.
Explicit weight bias refers to overt, consciously held negative 
attitudes that can be measured by self-report.
Implicit weight bias consists of automatic, negative attributions 
and stereotypes existing outside of conscious awareness.

Consensus Statement NATuRe MeDicine
responsibility72,73—can play an important part in the expression of 
weight stigma and reinforce weight-based stereotypes74.
The absence of national laws that prohibit weight discrimination 
can also contribute to expression of weight stigma, as it communi￾cates a societal message that weight stigma is acceptable and toler￾able. However, evidence in North America, Europe, Australia, and 
Iceland suggests that there might be substantial public support to 
enact and pass legislation to prohibit weight discrimination75,76.
The gap between scientific evidence and misconceptions in the 
public narrative. The notion that the causes of overweight and 
obesity depend on individuals’ faults, such as laziness and gluttony, 
stems from the assumption that body weight is entirely under voli￾tional control. This assumption and many of its corollaries are now 
at odds with a definitive body of biological and clinical evidence 
developed over the last few decades.
1. Body weight = calories in – calories out. This equation is often 
oversimplified in the public narrative of obesity, and even by HCPs, 
as if the two variables (calories in and calories out) were dependent 
only on two factors, amount of food consumed and exercise per￾formed, therefore implying that body weight is completely control￾lable by voluntary decisions to eat less and exercise more.
However, both variables of the equation depend on factors 
additional to just eating and exercising. For instance, energy intake 
depends on the amount of food consumed, but also on the amount 
of food-derived energy absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, 
which in turn is influenced by multiple factors, such as digestive 
enzymes, bile acids, microbiota, gut hormones, and neural signals, 
none of which are under voluntary control. Similarly, energy out￾put is not entirely accounted for by physical activity, which only 
contributes to ~30% of total daily energy expenditure. Metabolic 
rate accounts for 60–80% of total daily energy expenditure, with 
the thermic effect of feeding constituting approximately 10%77. 
Thus, even when individuals expend energy via exercise, except 
for elite athletes the overall contribution to energy expenditure is 
relatively small78.
The existence of a powerful, precise homeostatic system that 
maintains body weight within a relatively narrow, individualized 
range is supported by scientific evidence. This regulatory system 
can counteract voluntary efforts to reduce body weight by activat￾ing potent compensatory biologic responses (for example, increased 
appetite and decreased metabolic rate) that promote weight regain. 
Clinical evidence shows that a 10% weight loss elicits compensa￾tory changes in energy expenditure79, and modifications of appetite 
signals that increase hunger and reduce satiety. These metabolic and 
biologic adaptations can persist long-term after losing weight and 
continue even after partial weight regain80.
2. Obesity is primarily caused by voluntary overeating and a seden￾tary lifestyle. Although this concept might appear to be a straight￾forward conclusion, given common personal experiences of the 
fluctuations of body weight during periods of excess energy intake 
or sedentary lifestyle, the evidence supports a more nuanced situ￾ation. For example, in a Canadian study that used accelerometers 
to measure physical activity, girls with obesity took more steps per 
day than girls within the normal weight range81. Similar findings 
have been observed for adults82. Despite substantially higher levels 
of physical activity, total daily energy expenditure among hunter￾gatherers in Africa’s savannahs today is largely similar to that of 
adults living in modern European or US cities, where obesity preva￾lence is high83. These findings contrast with conventional views that 
primarily attribute the cause of obesity to sedentary lifestyles and 
suggest that compensatory metabolic adaptations maintain total 
energy expenditure relatively constant among human populations 
and across various levels of physical activities.
Additional evidence is now also available indicating other pos￾sible causes and contributors to obesity, including genetic84 and 
epigenetic factors85, foodborne factors86, sleep deprivation and cir￾cadian dysrhythmia87, psychological stress, endocrine disruptors, 
medications, and intrauterine and intergenerational effects. These 
factors do not require overeating or physical inactivity to explain 
excess weight88–90. A dominant role of genetic factors in obesity 
pathogenesis has also been demonstrated in studies comparing 
the concordance of body weight among fraternal versus identical 
twins91, for example, as well as studies of adults adopted as infants 
compared with their biological and adoptive parents77,92. Hence, 
overeating and reduced physical activity, when present, might be 
symptoms rather than the root causes of obesity93. Finally, the fre￾quent failure of therapeutic and public-health strategies focused on 
the recommendation to ‘eat less and move more’ should call into 
question a causal role of voluntary overeating and sedentary lifestyle 
as primary causes of obesity.
3. Obesity is a lifestyle choice. Persons with obesity typically recog￾nize obesity as a serious health problem, rather than a conscious 
choice. More than two thirds of 3,008 individuals with obesity sur￾veyed in the ACTION Study considered obesity to be as or more 
serious than other health conditions, including high blood pressure, 
diabetes, and depression94. Given the negative effects of obesity on 
quality of life, the well-known risks of serious complications and 
reduced life expectancy associated with it, it is a misconception to 
define obesity as a choice.
4. Obesity is a condition, not a disease. Labeling obesity as a disease, 
risk factor, or condition has implications for treatment and policy 
development and can contribute to promoting or mitigating stigma￾tizing views toward affected individuals. An argument often used 
against labeling obesity a disease is that doing so communicates a 
societal message that individual responsibility is not relevant in obe￾sity, thus reducing adherence to healthier lifestyles. Defining obesity 
as a disease, or not, however, should be based on objective medical 
and biological evidence, not sociologic implications.
The criteria generally used for recognition of disease status are 
clearly fulfilled in many individuals with obesity as commonly 
defined, albeit not all. These criteria include specific signs or symp￾toms (such as increased adiposity), reduced quality of life, and/or 
increased risk of further illness, complications, and deviation from 
normal physiology—or well-characterized pathophysiology (for 
example, inflammation, insulin resistance, and alterations of hor￾monal signals regulating satiety and appetite).
As reviewed in a statement from the World Obesity Federation95, 
many medical societies as well as the World Health Organization, 
the US Food and Drug Association, the US National Institutes of 
Health, and the Nagoya Declaration have now defined obesity as a 
disease or disease process.
Admittedly, however, defining obesity as a disease, but measur￾ing it only by BMI thresholds (as in contemporary medical practice), 
risks labeling as ill some individuals who, despite possibly being 
at risk of future illness, have no current evidence of disease—for 
example, in cases where high BMI results from being particularly 
muscular or having short stature. This potential risk of misdiagnosis 
underscores the inadequacy of current diagnostic criteria for obe￾sity, and the need to identify more meaningful clinical and biologi￾cal criteria than just BMI to diagnose the disease.
5. Severe obesity is usually reversible by voluntarily eating less and 
exercising more. This assumption is also not supported by evi￾dence. First, body weight and fat mass are known to be regulated by 
numerous physiological mechanisms, beyond voluntary food intake 
and physical exercise. A large body of clinical evidence has shown 
that voluntary attempts to eat less and exercise more render only

NATuRe MeDicine Consensus Statement
modest effects on body weight in most individuals with severe obe￾sity96,97. When fat mass decreases, the body responds with reduced 
resting energy expenditure79,80 and changes in signals that increase 
hunger and reduce satiety93 (for example, leptin, ghrelin)98. These 
compensatory metabolic and biologic adaptations promote weight 
regain and persist for as long as persons are in the reduced-energy 
state, even if they gain some weight back98.
Metabolic surgery is often referred to as an easy way out, based 
on assumptions that these interventions mechanically restrict food 
intake in a manner that individuals are not sufficiently disciplined 
to achieve on their own. However, evidence demonstrates that sur￾gical interventions elicit numerous metabolic effects opposite to the 
compensatory physiologic responses normally triggered by diet￾induced weight reduction, thereby promoting major, long-term 
weight loss99. Such mechanisms include a paradoxical decrease in 
appetite and increase in metabolic rate, which change adaptively in 
the opposite directions to those following most non-surgical weight 
loss77. There are also favorable post-operative alterations in gastro￾intestinal hormones, bile-acid signaling, gut microbiota, absorption 
and utilization of glucose by the gut, modulations of gastrointestinal 
nutrient signaling that influence insulin sensitivity, and others100.
Discussion
In this initiative, we sought to inform HCPs, policymakers, and the 
public about the prevalence, causes, and harmful consequences of 
weight stigma. A novel, specific goal not formulated in prior related 
initiatives was to address the gap between popular, stigmatizing nar￾ratives around obesity and current scientific knowledge regarding 
mechanisms of body-weight regulation. We found ample evidence 
of pervasive weight bias and stigma in many diverse domains of 
society, causing serious mental and physical harm to individuals 
with obesity. We met our primary objective of gathering a broad 
group of experts and scientific organizations to appraise the prob￾lem and, to our knowledge for the first time, speak with one voice 
against this important issue, pledging to do what we can to end it 
(pledge in Box 1, executive summary in Box 3, and recommenda￾tions in Table 3).
There are several limitations to our work. For example, largely 
owing to the nature of relevant publications, we did not perform 
a formal systematic review with stringent criteria for levels of evi￾dence. Our method of literature study was closer to a structured 
rapid review, performed over approximately 6 months, and it only 
included English-language papers. Also, although our expert panel 
comprised representatives from ten nations spanning five conti￾nents, it was heavily weighted toward individuals from the United 
States and other high-income countries. Much of the evidence base 
is also derived from these regions. It is important to note, however, 
that our final report has been formally endorsed by over 100 orga￾nizations at the time of publication (Box 2), including some from 
low-income and middle-income countries—attesting to the global 
relevance of the problem and our statements. A strength of our 
work is that we engaged a diverse group of panelists including aca￾demics from disparate disciplines, representatives of patient-advo￾cacy organizations and patients. The broad endorsement of this 
statement and pledge by a diverse group of organizations, including 
scientific societies, patient-advocacy groups, academic and medical 
centers, scientific journals, and a parliamentary group provides an 
unprecedented opportunity for a concerted effort of all stakehold￾ers to effectively tackle this important problem for medicine and 
society.
Conclusions
Weight stigma and discrimination are pervasive and cause sig￾nificant harm to affected individuals. The widespread narrative of 
obesity in the media, in public health campaigns, in political dis￾course, and even in the scientific literature attributing the cause of 
obesity primarily to personal responsibility has an important role 
in the expression of societal weight stigma, and reinforces weight￾based stereotypes. Weight stigma can mislead clinical decisions, 
and public health messages, and could promote unproductive 
allocation of limited research resources. Weight bias and stigma 
can result in discrimination, and undermine human rights, social 
rights, and the health of afflicted individuals. Explaining the 
gap between scientific evidence, and a conventional narrative of 
obesity built around unproven assumptions and misconceptions 
might help to reduce weight bias, and its harmful effects. A con￾certed effort of all stakeholders is required to promote educa￾tional, regulatory, and legal initiatives designed to prevent weight 
stigma and discrimination.
