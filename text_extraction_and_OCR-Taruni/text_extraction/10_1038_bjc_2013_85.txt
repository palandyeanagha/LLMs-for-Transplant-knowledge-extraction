Background: Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has not been shown to be superior to bland embolisation (TAE) for
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods: We conducted a randomised phase II/III trial in patients with untreated HCC. Patients were randomised to TAE with
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles alone or sequential TACE (sTACE) in which cisplatin 50 mg was administered intrarterially
4–6 h before PVA embolisation. Treatment was repeated 3-weekly for up to three treatments. The primary endpoint was overall
survival and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, toxicity and response. Target sample sizes for phase II and III
were 80 and 322.
Results: The trial was terminated at phase II after 86 patients had been randomised. Patients were well matched for prognostic
criteria. All three planned treatments were given to 57.1% (TAE) and 56.8% (TACE) patients. Grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in 63.5%
and 83.7%, respectively (P ¼ 0.019). End-of-treatment RECIST response (CR þ PR) was 13.2 and 32.6% (P ¼ 0.04) (mRECIST 47.3%
and 67.4) and median overall survival and progression-free survival was 17.3 vs 16.3 (P ¼ 0.74) months and 7.2 vs 7.5 (P ¼ 0.59),
respectively.
Conclusion: Transarterial chemoembolisation according this novel schedule is feasible and associated with a higher response rate
than TAE alone. The survival benefit of TACE over TAE remains unproven.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common type
of cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of
death from cancer, resulting in around 600 000 deaths annually
(Parkin et al, 2005). The major risk factors are infection
with hepatitis B and C virus, which increase the risk of liver
cancer 20-fold. Liver cirrhosis is present in 80% of cases and both
prognosis and treatment are determined by liver function as well as
tumour-related factors and performance status (Okuda et al, 1985;
CLIP Investigators, 1998; Llovet et al, 1999). Overall the prognosis
is extremely poor with incidence closely matching mortality.
Potentially curative options including transplantation, resection or
ablation are applicable to less than 30% of patients who meet
defined criteria and the majority of patients are therefore treated
with palliative intent.

Transarterial embolisation (TAE) and chemoembolisation
(TACE) have been widely used to treat HCC and exploit the dual
blood supply to the liver in which the liver parenchyma receives
most of its blood supply from the portal vein, while the tumour is
supplied predominantly by the hepatic artery. This allows selective
cannulation of vessels supplying the tumour and occlusion by
embolic particles leading to tumour hypoxia and necrosis. The
procedure can be performed with the co-administration of arterial
chemotherapy (transarterial chemoembolisation, TACE), but there
is considerable heterogeneity in the technique in relation to the type
of embolic particle, the chemotherapy drugs used and the schedule
of administration (Marelli et al, 2007). Evidence that TACE
improves survival comes from two small randomised trials in which
gelfoam embolisation was performed with either doxorubicin
(Llovet et al, 2002) or cisplatin (Lo et al, 2002) and found to be
superior to best supportive care. These trials were included in a
subsequent meta-analysis of seven trials including 545 patients,
which concluded that TACE, but not TAE, was associated with a
significant 2-year survival benefit over best supportive care (Llovet
and Bruix, 2003). Since the publication of this meta-analysis two
further trials have been reported and an updated meta-analysis
performed by the Cochrane Collaboration which included nine
trials and 645 participants (Oliveri et al, 2011). It was observed that
the individual trials were underpowered, at risk of bias and that
there was heterogeneity between the trials. Overall, the authors
concluded neither TAE nor TACE improved survival compared
with best supportive care. The discrepancy between these two
reviews is attributable to application of different criteria for trial
inclusion and the validity of the Cochrane review has been
questioned on this basis (Ray, Jr et al, 2011; Forner et al, 2012).
The contribution of chemotherapy to the effectiveness of TACE
has also been questioned given that HCC is relatively chemoresistant
(Burroughs et al, 2004; Asghar and Meyer, 2012), and there is
currently no definite evidence that TACE is superior to TAE (Marelli
et al, 2007). However, the conventional method of delivering TACE
may not be optimal in terms of achieving maximum cytotoxic effect
from chemotherapy. First, TACE is usually performed at intervals of
several months rather than according to more frequent oncological
schedules designed to prevent tumour repopulation. Second, the co￾administration of chemotherapy with particles may compromise the
delivery of drug to the tumour, and the resulting tumour hypoxia is
known to be an important cause of chemoresistance (Tak et al, 2011;
Asghar and Meyer, 2012).
Given these considerations and the uncertain benefit of TACE
over TAE, we designed a randomised trial in which the delivery
of chemotherapy was optimised to maximise its potential benefit.
We selected cisplatin, as this drug is well tolerated in liver
impairment and was effective in a previously reported randomised
trial (Lo et al, 2002). Cisplatin induces DNA damage by inducing
intra- and interstrand crosslinks which in turn lead to apoptosis or
cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. For our study, cisplatin was
administered 4–6 h before embolisation allowing DNA damage to
occur before acute hypoxia. We have termed this procedure sTACE
(sequential TACE) to distinguish it from other types of TACE such
as; (a) lipiodol-based TACE, which has been termed ‘conventional’
TACE (cTACE) in which TAE is performed immediately following
administration of a lipiodol/cytotoxic suspension, (b) drug-eluting
bead (DEB)-TACE in which chemotherapy is conjugated directly
to DEBs. To reduce the opportunity for tumour repopulation,
a 3-weekly treatment schedule was mandated.
METHODS
Trial Design. This phase II/III trial was designed to compare TAE
with sTACE in patients with non-resectable HCC. Patients were
randomised to one of the two treatment arms in a 1 : 1 ratio.
Randomisation was carried out by the coordinating centre using a
paper list, and was stratified by recruiting site. The purpose of the
phase II aspect of the trial was to examine the safety, tolerability
and feasibility of delivering the treatments.
This trial was ethically approved by the institutional review
board and registered on an appropriate clinical trial databases
(ISRCTN63349435). The trial was coordinated centrally by the
Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials
Centre (UCL CTC). Ongoing safety and efficacy were indepen￾dently assessed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee.
The design, conduct and reporting of this trial adheres to the
CONSORT 2010 Statement (Schulz et al, 2010).
Patients. Patients were eligible if they were X16 years old and had
HCC diagnosed according to the EASL criteria (Bruix et al, 2001);
(1) histology or (2) evidence of a focal lesion 42 cm with arterial
hypervascularisation detected on two radiological studies (any two
of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging or angiography) in a patient with a background of
cirrhosis; or (3) a single radiological study with an a-fetoprotein
greater than 400 ng ml  1
. Patients were not eligible if they were
candidates for surgical resection. The extent of disease was
required to be either a solitary hepatic tumour 43 cm in diameter
or multifocal. Other eligibility criteria included ECOG perfor￾mance status (PS) 0–2, platelets X50  109 per litre, INRp1.5,
GFRX50 ml min  1
, bilirubinp100 mmol l  1
. Patients were not
eligible if they had received prior treatment for HCC, if there was
evidence of extra-hepatic metastases, or if they had a Child Pugh
score of C. Patients were also excluded if they had active sepsis or
bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites refractory to diuretic
therapy, or documented occlusion of the hepatic artery or portal
vein. Pregnant or lactating women were not eligible for the trial.
Procedures. Patients received either TAE or sTACE. Treatment
with TAE consisted of selective angiography followed by
embolisation with 50–150 mm polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles
at segmental or lobar level. Bilobar lesions were treated separately if
they could not be treated by highly selective (segmental or sub
segmental) embolisation. Prophylactic antibiotics were adminis￾tered to reduce the risk of infection. For sTACE, cisplatin (50 mg in
50 ml) was administered intra-arterially as an injection over
15 min. The cisplatin injection was preceded by intravenous (i.v.)
hydration and anti-emetics and followed by more i.v. hydration.
TAE was performed as described above 4–6 h after cisplatin
administration. Treatment was repeated up to three times at
3-weekly intervals. Patients were withdrawn from further trial
treatment if treatment was delayed by more than 3 weeks due to
haematological toxicity or if they experienced any grade IV non￾haematological toxicity. After the final treatment, patients were
assessed at 1 month and then 3 monthly, thereafter. Further TAE
procedures were undertaken at the investigator’s discretion if the
tumour demonstrated residual vascularity but sorafenib was not
offered on progression because approval and funding only became
available after the completion of the trial.
Adverse events (AEs) were assessed before each treatment, at
completion of treatment and at all follow-up visits and graded
according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Patients were invited to complete
quality of life (QoL) questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and
EORTC QLQ-HCC 18). QoL questionnaires were completed
before start of treatment, at completion of treatment and 3 and 6
months after completion of treatment.
Before commencing treatment, patients were staged by means of
a triphasic spiral CT scan of the chest and abdomen or a CT scan
of the thorax and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
abdomen. Repeat scanning was carried out at completion of
treatment and 3 monthly thereafter until progression. Response

was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 (Therasse et al, 2000)
criteria and mRECIST (Lencioni and Llovet, 2010; Gillmore et al,
2011). Patients who initially responded were offered a further
course of treatment upon progression, provided they met the
treatment criteria listed above. Patients who received a liver
transplant were followed-up according to the local transplant
protocol.
Statistics. The recruitment target for the phase II trial was 80
patients (40 in each arm) with the aim of assessing safety,
tolerability and the feasibility of delivering the treatments. We
considered that an underlying grade 4 toxicity rate of greater than
30% would be unacceptable. Therefore, if 19 patients in either arm
suffered any toxicity of grade 4 (except pain), the trial was to be
stopped. Patients who were recruited into TACE, and then
subsequently received a liver transplant, were replaced by
recruiting additional patients to be able to fully evaluate treatment
safety. In April 2009, the independent data monitoring committee
(IDMC) were asked to advise on increasing the phase II
recruitment target to compensate for patients who underwent
liver transplants. The IDMC agreed that this was reasonable and
the sample size for the phase II trial was increased to obtain 80
evaluable patients.
The phase III part of the trial was designed to detect a difference
in 2-year survival from 50 to 63% with 80% power and a 5% level
of statistical significance. For this, 322 patients would have been
recruited over 4 years with follow-up of at least 1 year. In February
2010, the IDMC recommended terminating the trial because the
recruitment rate was not compatible with a timely completion of
the phase III trial.
Comparison of survival between the two treatment groups was
made using the log-rank test and Cox regression was used to
estimate the hazard ratio. We also ran models that included the
site, the stratification factor used in the randomisation. The
following planned subgroup analyses were carried out; Child Pugh,
Okuda, Barcelona-Clı´nic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Cancer of the Liver
Italian Program (CLIP) and French staging classifications (10).
Quality of life scores were analysed by comparing changes from
baseline scores between the two treatment groups.
We performed an update to our published meta-analysis
comparing TAE vs TACE (Marelli et al, 2007) using as primary
outcome the number of patients reported as dead during follow-up.
The meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA
recommendations (Moher et al, 2009). Studies were identified by
searching Medline and Embase using the following keywords:
‘hepatocellular carcinoma’ or ‘HCC’ or ‘hepatic tumour’ or ‘liver
tumour’ or ‘hepatic cancer’ or ‘liver cancer’ and ‘TACE’ or ‘TAE’ or
‘chemoembolisation’ or ‘embolisation’ and ‘clinical trials’. The
analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.1 (Nordic
Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Meta-analyses were
performed using random effects models due to expected clinical
heterogeneity. The number of events and number of patients in
each intervention arm were used to calculate relative risks (RR) and
95% confident intervals (CI). I
2 values were calculated as measures
of the degree of intertrial heterogeneity. Data on all patients
randomised were extracted to allow intention-to-treat analyses.

RESULTS
Patients and treatment. A total of 86 patients were recruited from
two sites; the Royal Free Hospital and University College London
Hospital, between December 2003 and November 2009. Patients
were randomised to TAE (n ¼ 42) or sTACE (n ¼ 44) with 38 and
43 patients, respectively, receiving the allocated intervention
(Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients were well
matched in terms of key prognostic criteria including Child Pugh
score, focality, performance status and aetiology of liver disease.
Overall 82.6% had Child Pugh A cirrhosis, 67.4% were ECOG
performance status 0, 67.4% had multifocal disease, 39.5% were
BCLC stage B and 31.4% stage C due to PS 40.
In the TAE arm, 57.1% of patients received all three planned
treatments compared with 56.8% in the sTACE arm and at least
two treatments were delivered to 64.3% and 75.0% of patients in
the two arms, respectively. Two patients in the sTACE arm
received only chemotherapy and were not embolised for one or
two of their treatments due to development of portal vein
occlusion and extent of bilobar disease, respectively. There was
no significant difference between the arms with respect to the
number of treatments patients received (P ¼ 0.26). The most
common reason that patients stopped treatment early was adverse
events or toxicity. However the number of patients stopping early
was similar in each arm; 7 (16.7%) in the TAE and 8 (18.2%) in the
sTACE arm. Treatments were delivered in a timely manner with
over 84.3% of treatments in the TAE arm being given within 48 h
of the planned procedure and 84.8% in the sTACE arm. In 66.8%
of cases, particle embolisation was unilobar and there were no dose
reductions required for cisplatin. The median length of hospital
stay for all treatments was 2 days range (1–41 days).
Toxicity and safety. For TAE and sTACE, the most common
grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicity was grade 3 pain occurring
in 7 (18.4%) and 10 (23.3%) patients (Table 2). One patient in the
TAE arm and two in the sTACE arm had grade 4 pain. Two
patients receiving sTACE developed a liver abscess. The most
common biochemical disturbance was grade 3 elevation of gamma￾glutamyl transpeptidase occurring in 9 (23.7%) and 17 (39.5%)
patients (1 patient in the TAE arm had a grade 4 elevation) and
grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia in 5 (13.2%) and 4 (9.3%) patients.
One patient in the TAE arm and two in the sTACE arm
experienced grade 4 hyperbilirubinaemia. Within the sTACE
group, myelosuppression was very uncommon with only one
patient experiencing grade 3 neutropenia. Overall grade 3/4
toxicity occurred in 63.5% and 83.7% in the TAE and sTACE
groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.019). There were two deaths that were
classified as treatment-related. One patient in the sTACE arm
completed all three planned treatments and died 43 days later after
his third sTACE from decompensated liver disease. The second
patient was in the TAE arm and developed renal and liver failure
following the first treatment and died 17 days after the TAE
procedure.
Efficacy. For patients who had at least one treatment, the end-of￾treatment response rates according to RECIST 1.0 were 13.2% and
32.6% (P ¼ 0.04) for TAE and sTACE, respectively. Four patients
in each group achieved a partial response (PR) on further follow￾up giving a best overall response rate (PR) of 23.7% and 41.9%.
There were no complete responses (CR) by RECIST and
progressive disease (PD) occurred in 26.3% and 7%. Applying
the mRECIST criteria, the overall response rate (CR and PR) was
47.3% and 67.4%, respectively (Table 3).
All 86 patients were included in the final survival analysis,
which was conducted 15.6 months after the last patient was
randomised. At the time of the analysis, the median follow-up was

24.0 months (range: 0.03–56.0), 54.7% patients had died and 68.6%
had met the progression-free survival endpoint. The cause of death
in 83.0% of cases was progressive hepatocellular carcinoma.
According to the intention-to-treat analysis there was no difference
in survival between the TAE and the sTACE group (HR: 0.91, 95%
CI: 0.51–1.62, P ¼ 0.74) with a median survival of 17.3 and 16.3
months for each group, respectively (Figure 2B).
The 1-year survival rates were 68% (95% CI; 50–81) and 64%
(95% CI; 45–78), and the 2-year survival rates were 39% (95% CI
22–56) and 32% (95% CI 15–50) for TAE and TACE, respectively.
There was also no difference in progression-free survival time
between the two arms (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.52–1.45, P ¼ 0.59) with
a median of 7.2 months for TAE and 7.5 months for TACE
Figure 2A).
Four patients in the TAE group and two in the TACE group
underwent liver transplantation during the course of the planned
treatment and a further five and eight, respectively, underwent
transplantation during the follow-up period. When the trans￾planted patients were censored at the time of transplant the 1-year,
2-year and median overall survival was; 64.5% (44.8–78.8), 32.7%
(16.0–50.5) and 16.2 months for TAE and 61.9% (42.4–76.5),
25.4% (9.8–44.7) and 16.0 for sTACE.
Quality of life. Quality of life data was collected at baseline, 72 h
pre-randomisation, 2–4 weeks after treatment completion and at
the 3 and 6 month follow-up appointments using the EORTC
QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Data for the later time points was sparse
so the decision was taken to analyse only the change in scores from
baseline to post-treatment. This gave 33 assessable patients. None
of the scores showed any significant difference between the arms
suggesting that the addition of chemotherapy did not lead to
deterioration in quality of life compared with bland embolisation
(Table 4).
Meta-analysis of trials comparing TAE vs TACE. We identified
five eligible trials including the present one, of which three,
including the current study, had a mean follow-up of 2 years
(Kawai et al, 1992; Llovet et al, 2002) and the remaining two of 1
year (Chang et al, 1994; Malagari et al, 2010). We wrote to the
authors of one study to obtain information not included in the
article (Chang et al, 1994). Transarterial chemoembolisation was
performed with doxorubicin and lipiodol in two studies (Kawai
et al, 1992; Llovet et al, 2002), with doxorubicin-loaded DEB￾TACE in one (Malagari et al, 2010) and cisplatin in our study and
one other (Chang et al, 1994). TAE was performed with a variety of
materials: lipiodol and gelfoam (Kawai et al, 1992; Chang et al,
1994), gelfoam alone (Llovet et al, 2002), BeadBlocks (Malagari
et al, 2010) and PVA particles in our study. As shown in Figure 3,
there was no significant difference in mortality between the two
modalities (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84–1.41, P ¼ 0.13) and although
there was some heterogeneity between studies (I
2 ¼ 44%), it was
not significant (P ¼ 0.13).
DISCUSSION
According to the most recent EASL-EORTC practice guidelines,
chemoembolisation is recommended for patients with BCLC stage
B, multinodular asymptomatic tumours without vascular invasion

or extra-hepatic spread (European Association For The Study Of
The Liver and European Organisation For Research And
Treatment Of Cancer, 2012). However, the optimal method or
schedule remains undefined and the contribution of chemotherapy
remains uncertain (Marelli et al, 2007). In our trial, we evaluated a
novel TACE protocol (sTACE) designed to optimise the effect of
chemotherapy and overcome some of the theoretical flaws in the
conventional protocols. The protocol proved to be feasible and
tolerable in the majority of patients although grade 3/4 toxicity was
increased in the sTACE arm compared with the TAE arm. The
response rates according to both RECIST 1.0 and mRECIST tended
to be higher in the sTACE arm and we have previously shown that
end-of-treatment response according to mRECIST is an indepen￾dent factor predicting better survival (Gillmore et al, 2011).
However, in this trial, the differences in the mRECIST response
between the two arms did not reach significance nor was there
evidence that sTACE improved survival compared with TAE.
The patient population included in our study had characteristics
similar to those reported in the two previous studies reporting
positive outcome with TACE (Llovet et al, 2002; Lo et al, 2002) and
the majority of patients were BCLC stage B. Those patients with
BCLC stage C disease were classified as such on the basis of their
performance status only. The survival outcome in our study was
also very similar to that reported by Lo et al (2002), who also used
cisplatin-based TACE and reported a 1-year survival of 57% and
2-year survival of 31%, which compares with 66% and 36% in our
trial (Lo et al, 2002). The recent EASL guidelines (European
Association For The Study Of The Liver and European
Organisation For Research And Treatment Of Cancer, 2012)
acknowledge the wide range of survival outcomes reported for
TACE-treated patients, which varies between 13 months in
multicentre prospective trials (Doffoel et al, 2008) to 48 months
in single centres (Burrel et al, 2012). Within the BCLC B
classification, there is no limit on tumour size, number of tumours

or level of AFP, and both child A and B patients are included.
Hence, the prognostic spectrum within this group is wide and
patient selection is likely to be an important determinant of
survival.
The anticipated benefit of adding chemotherapy to TACE
assumes that hepatocellular is sufficiently chemosensitive to
improve survival over and above that obtained by TAE alone.
However, systemic chemotherapy has been used for over 30 years
in the treatment of HCC and is associated with response rates of
less than 10% in large randomised trials (Burroughs et al, 2004;
Asghar and Meyer, 2012). Furthermore, the survival benefit is
uncertain, as there have been no large randomised trials comparing
chemotherapy vs best supportive care. Given that transarterial
embolisation alone is highly effective in inducing tumour necrosis
(Marelli et al, 2007), it may be difficult to detect any improvement
by adding local chemotherapy, which has limited efficacy as a
single agent. In our study, we did not use lipiodol and we have
previously reported the lack of evidence for its use (Marelli et al,
2007). As chemotherapy is hydrophilic, it rapidly moves into the
systemic circulation when co-administered with lipiodol, and
pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that area under the
concentration–time curve for doxorubicin is the same whether
administered as bolus injection or as an emulsion with lipiodol
(Johnson et al, 1991; Dodds et al, 1996). The recent introduction of
DEBs allow the delivery of high local concentrations of
doxorubicin with reduced systemic AUC (Varela et al, 2007), yet
trials comparing DEB-TACE with conventional lipiodol-based
TACE (cTACE) do not show an improved response rate, although
the toxicity attributable to chemotherapy is substantially reduced
(Lammer et al, 2010; Malagari et al, 2010). Moreover, the results of
a randomised trial comparing DEB-TACE with bead-alone TAE
has recently been reported and published in abstract form. No
significant difference in response rate or survival was found
(Brown et al, 2012).
As our trial was discontinued at phase II, we were not able to
assess the primary survival endpoint of the phase III component.
However, some evidence regarding survival has been provided by
an update of our previous meta-analysis (Marelli et al, 2007) in
which we have included data from the current trial and another
recently published study (Malagari et al, 2010), which increases the
total number of patients included to 582 from five randomised
trials. No significant difference was found and there is therefore no
current evidence that TACE using any method is superior TAE
alone. A definitive answer to this question can only be obtained by
adequately powered randomised phase III trials.
Despite TAE or TACE, patients relapse at the treated site, or at
new hepatic sites or in extra-hepatic locations. Efforts should
therefore focus on reducing the rate of relapse or progression by
the addition of effective systemic therapy. The current standard of
care for advanced disease is sorafenib, which acts partly through
the inhibition of signalling through VEGFR and PDGFR, both
known to be important for tumour angiogenesis. Tumour
embolisation results in hypoxia and the transcription of genes
such as VEGF leads to angiogenesis and this may contribute to
tumour re-growth. Hence the concurrent administration of
sorafenib with intra-arterial embolisation may prevent relapse of
treated disease and growth of new or metastatic tumours. This
combination has been shown to be safe in phase I and II trials
(Dufour et al, 2010; Pawlik et al, 2011; Lencioni R et al, 2012) and a
randomised phase II trial has also been reported (Lencioni R et al,
2012). Two randomised phase III trials; TACE 2 (NCT01324076)
and ECOG1208 (NCT01004978), continue to accrue and a number
of other systemic agents are also being evaluated in this setting.
