Abstract
Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESC/hiPSC) are promising cell sources for the derivation of large
numbers of specific cell types for tissue engineering and cell therapy applications. We have describe a directed
differentiation protocol that generates fibroblasts from both hESC and hiPSC (EDK/iPDK) that support the repair and
regeneration of epithelial tissue in engineered, 3D skin equivalents. In the current study, we analyzed the secretory profiles
of EDK and iPDK cells to investigate the production of factors that activate and promote angiogenesis. Analysis of in vitro
secretion profiles from EDK and iPDK cells demonstrated the elevated secretion of pro-angiogenic soluble mediators,
including VEGF, HGF, IL-8, PDGF-AA, and Ang-1, that stimulated endothelial cell sprouting in a 3D model of angiogenesis
in vitro. Phenotypic analysis of EDK and iPDK cells during the course of differentiation from hESCs and iPSCs revealed that
both cell types progressively acquired pericyte lineage markers NG2, PDGFRb, CD105, and CD73 and demonstrated
transient induction of pericyte progenitor markers CD31, CD34, and Flk1/VEGFR2. Furthermore, when co-cultured with
endothelial cells in 3D fibrin-based constructs, EDK and iPDK cells promoted self-assembly of vascular networks and vascular
basement membrane deposition. Finally, transplantation of EDK cells into mice with hindlimb ischemia significantly reduced
tissue necrosis and improved blood perfusion, demonstrating the potential of these cells to stimulate angiogenic responses
in vivo. These findings demonstrate that stable populations of pericyte-like angiogenic cells can be generated with high
efficiency from hESC and hiPSC using a directed differentiation approach. This provides new cell sources and opportunities
for vascular tissue engineering and for the development of novel strategies in regenerative medicine.

Introduction
It is well established that mesenchymal progenitor cells make an
important contribution to angiogenesis during repair and regen￾eration. Multiple growth factors regulate the mobilization and
recruitment of mesenchymal cells to sites of neovascularization,
while directing these cells to a variety of mesenchymal cell fates
and functions [1–3]. Thus, the biological plasticity of mesenchy￾mal progenitor cells is linked to their ability to promote
angiogenesis and vascular regeneration which is essential for
defining their therapeutic utility. However, the broad-scale use of
mesenchymal cells for regenerative therapies remains somewhat
limited due to their heterogeneity in vivo that complicates the
isolation of well-defined populations of mesenchymal progenitor
cells.
The development of functional mesenchymal progenitor cells
for specific therapeutic applications has been further complicated
by their inherent plasticity. For example, recent studies have
suggested that perivascular mesenchymal cells, such as pericytes,
may constitute a subset of mesenchymal progenitor cells [4]. It has
been shown that the ontogeny of pericytes is complex because they
can be traced to various developmental origins including
neuroectoderm [5,6] and mesoderm [7–9]. Pericytes do not
display definitive molecular markers that can clearly distinguish
these cells from other mesenchymal cell types and they share many
properties with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including
perivascular localization in vivo, common molecular markers, and
ability to differentiate in vitro into various mesenchymal lineages
[3,4,10,11]. While pericytes and other stromal cell types of
mesenchymal origin play a central role in neovascularization, this
uncertainty about their cellular origins and fate currently limit
their applications for regenerative therapies.
In light of this, human pluripotent stem cells, such as human
embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSC), may be complementary to adult sources of mesenchymal
progenitor cells for therapeutic applications. These pluripotent cell
sources can be differentiated in ways that direct them to cell types
that manifest the functional properties important for angiogenic
responses during tissue regeneration. However, the angiogenic
potential of hESC- and hiPSC-derived mesenchymal progenitor
cells has not been fully explored. Several recent studies have
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83755

described the isolation of cells with properties overlapping with
MSCs from hESC and hiPSC that show several cellular functions
that are typical of pericytes [12–14]. These cells have been
generated upon the spontaneous differentiation of embryoid
bodies [12] or by differentiating monolayer cultures of hESC
and hiPSC [13,14]. Cells derived in this way have been shown to
stabilize endothelial cell networks in vitro and to promote re￾vascularization and functional recovery of ischemic tissues in vivo.
These studies have suggested that these cells are mesenchymal
progenitors based on their multilineage differentiation potential,
expression of commonly accepted surface markers and their
capacity to support angiogenesis both in culture and in vivo.
However, a more detailed analysis of the ontogeny of these cells
has not been explored. In addition, it is not clear whether these
previous approaches can generate sufficient numbers of mesen￾chymal progenitor cells with a proliferative potential that would be
useful for clinical applications.
We have recently reported a directed differentiation approach
that generates fibroblasts from human pluripotent stem cells using
defined substrate and media conditions and exposure to bone
morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) [15,16] that support epithelial
tissue repair and regeneration [17,18]. We now report that
fibroblasts generated using our differentiation protocol from both,
hESC and hiPSC (named EDK and iPDK, respectively) support
angiogenic processes in vitro and in vivo. These cells express
phenotypic markers of pericytes, secrete angiogenic growth factors
and cytokines, promote angiogenesis and formation of vascular
network in vitro, and rescue limb ischemia in vivo. As the critical
role of vasculogenesis in tissue repair and regeneration has been
elucidated, the innovative use of pluripotent stem cell sources for
derivation of angiogenic cells opens new possibilities for disease
modeling and for the development of novel strategies for
regenerative therapies.
Results
EDK and iPDK Cells Secrete Elevated Levels of Pro￾angiogenic Growth Factors
We first analyzed the secretory profiles of EDK and iPDK cells,
that were generated and cultured as previously described [15,16].
The directed differentiation protocol and the morphology of EDK
and iPDK cells are shown in Fig. 1. To identify paracrine factors
that may be associated with an angiogenic response, secretory
profiles of EDK and iPDK cells were assessed using an antibody
array designed to detect soluble mediators of angiogenesis (Fig. 2A).
Profiles of EDK and iPDK were generated by quantifying the
mean spot pixel densities from the array membranes and
normalizing to their respective positive controls (Fig. 2A, 2B,
Table 1). EDK and iPDK cells showed very similar secretion
profiles (Table 1). Both cell lines expressed elevated levels of pro￾angiogenic factors Angiogenin-1 (Ang-1), Amphiregulin (AR),
HGF, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IL-8, PDGF-AA, Trombospondin-1
(TSP-1), and VEGF, as well as anti-angiogenic factors Endostatin,
PTX3, and Serpin E1 (Fig. 2B). In addition, both EDK and iPDK
showed elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase regulators
TIMP1 and TIMP4, which are known to play a role in proteolytic
matrix degradation during angiogenic sprouting (Fig. 2B). There
was a noticeable difference in levels of Coagulation factor III (TF),
CXCL16, KGF, MCP-1, and MMP9 in EDK when compared to
iPDK cells (Table 1). Analysis of the secretory profile of control,
dermal-derived fibroblasts (BJ) using the same antibody array
showed that the levels of key angiogenic regulators VEGF, PDGF￾AA, HGF, Ang-1, AR, Endostatin, and TIMP-4 were significantly
lower when compared to secretory profiles of EDK and iPDK cells
(Fig. 2A, 2B, Table 1). We then confirmed the expression levels of
select pro-angiogenic factors VEGF, HGF and IL-8 using ELISA
and found that the production of these factors was dramatically
induced by hypoxia in both EDK and iPDK cells (Fig. 2C). These
findings demonstrated that cells derived from hESC and hiPSC
secrete a similar spectrum of paracrine factors known to stimulate
angiogenesis.
EDK and iPDK Cells Express Phenotypic Markers of
Pericytes
To learn more about the lineage of EDK and iPDK cells, these
cells were monitored for expression of neural crest and mesoder￾mal progenitor markers during sequential stages of differentiation.
The change in mRNA and protein expression following induction
of differentiation of hESC and hiPSC was analyzed at days 0, 7,
14, and 28 days by real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Data
analysis revealed similarities in temporal gene expression profiles
of differentiating hESC and hiPSC, which showed downregulation
of neural crest markers p75(NTR), HNK1 and Sox10 and
transient induction of mesodermal progenitor markers GATA4,
T (Brachyury homolog) and Mesogenin-1 (MSGN1) following
BMP4 treatment at day 7 (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that
culture conditions supporting the differentiation of hESC and
hiPSC towards mesodermal progenitors and the divergence from
neuroectodermal fate. Further analysis revealed the transient
induction of markers associated with vasculogenic progenitors,
including VEGFR2, CD34 and CD31 following BMP4 treatment
at day 7 of differentiation (Fig. 3B). Analysis of markers associated
with pericytes showed a gradual increase in expression levels of
NG2, PDGFRb, CD73, and CD105 (Fig. 3C, 3E, Table 2).
Analysis of levels of CD146 showed a slight decrease throughout
the differentiation of hESC and hiPSC, from 95% to 75% and
95% to 80%, respectively (Fig. 3E, Table 2). The gene expression
level of aSMA was increased at day 7 of differentiation, however
this level decreased significantly by day 14, and was 5-fold
downregulated at day 28 compared to pluripotent cells (Fig. 3C).
Flow cytometric analysis of aSMA protein showed that 40% of
differentiated EDK and 50% of iPDK cell population stained
positively for this protein (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that aSMA was
sustained in these cells. Taken together, temporal gene and protein
expression patterns suggest that culture conditions were conducive
for differentiation of hESC and iPSC towards a lineage with
features overlapping with pericytes.

Angiogenic Factors Secreted by EDK and iPDK Cells
Induce Endothelial Sprouting in vitro
To determine whether soluble factors produced by EDK and
iPDK cells could promote endothelial sprouting, these cells were
incorporated into a 3D, in vitro sprouting assay that recapitulates
the early stage of the angiogenic process [19]. For this assay,
microcarrier beads were coated with human dermal-derived
microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and embedded into a
fibrin gel. EDK and iPDK cells were then layered on the gel
surface to test if their secretion of soluble factors could promote
endothelial cells sprouting from the surface of the beads. After
incubation for 48 hours, numerous sprouts were seen in EDK- and
iPDK-containing cultures compared to control cultures grown in
basal media or basal media supplemented with 50 ng/ml of
VEGF (Fig. 4A). VEGF supplementation led to a slight increase in
sprouting when compared to levels seen for incubation with basal
media (Fig. 4A). Quantification of endothelial sprouts revealed
that their number was significantly increased in both EDK- and
iPDK-containing cultures when compared to both control cultures
(Fig. 4B). These findings suggest paracrine mechanisms are linked
to the activation of endothelial cell sprouting by EDK and iPDK
cells.
EDK and iPDK Cells Support 3D Vascular Network
Formation in vitro
As another functional outcome linked to angiogenesis, we next
studied the ability of EDK and iPDK cells to support in vitro,
vascular network formation within 3D fibrin-based constructs
(Fig. 5A). RFP-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(RFP-HUVEC) were mixed with either EDK or iPDK cells at
ratios of 5:1, 3:1 and 1:1 within fibrin matrices, and allowed to
spontaneously assemble into vessel-like networks for 8 days.
Confocal microscopy analysis showed that after 8 days, RFP￾HUVEC cells formed interconnected vessel-like networks in the
presence of both EDK and iPDK cells at all ratios of RFP￾HUVEC: EDK and RFP-HUVEC: iPDK tested (5:1, 3:1 and 1:1)
(Fig. 5B). Assessment of network morphology revealed a significant
increase in mean vessel length and a decrease in vessel thickness as
the ratio of RFP-HUVEC to EDK and iPDK decreased (Fig. 5C).
In contrast, RFP-HUVEC cultured alone in complete endothelial
media or in the media conditioned by EDK or iPDK cells for 24
hours failed to form interconnected vascular networks (Fig. 5D).
Foreskin-derived BJ fibroblasts co-cultured with RFP-HUVEC at
ratio 3:1 could promote a minor degree of patterning of
endothelial cells but failed to induce formation of capillary-like
structures of uniform length or diameter as seen for EDK- and
iPDK-containing cultures (Fig. 5D). This indicates that EDK and
iPDK cells provide a specific set of signals to drive the formation of
stable capillary-like network.
EDK and iPDK Cells are Required for Stabilization of 3D
Vascular Network and Deposition of Vascular Basement
Membrane
In order to obtain further insights into interactions between
pluripotent stem cell-derived fibroblasts and endothelial cells,
EDK and iPDK cells were labeled with GFP and incorporated
into fibrin constructs with RFP-HUVEC at a ratio 3:1
(HUVEC:EDK/iPDK). Fibrin constructs were monitored for 8
days after seeding using confocal microscopy. During this 8 day
period, RFP-HUVEC co-cultured with GFP-EDK and GFP￾iPDK underwent phenotypic changes that resulted in formation of
interconnected vascular networks (Fig. 6A). After 1 day in culture,
GFP-EDK and GFP-iPDK cells began spreading in the matrix
while RFP-HUVEC remained rounded (Fig. 6A, 1d). After 4 days
in culture, RFP-HUVEC became elongated and formed disorga￾nized partially connected vascular networks that co-localized with
GFP-expressing EDK and iPDK cells situated at various points
above and below the focal plane (Fig. 6A, 4d). After 8 days in
culture, RFP-HUVEC assembled into stable vascular networks
with segments of uniform diameter (,15–20 mm) that co-localized
with GFP-expressing, EDK and iPDK cells (Fig. 6A, 8d, Fig. 6B,
Video S1). As neither monoculture of RFP-HUVEC in complete
endothelial media nor monoculture of RFP-HUVEC in EDK￾and iPDK-conditioned media resulted in formation of intercon￾nected vascular networks (Fig. 5D), direct interactions between
EDK and iPDK cells are likely to be necessary to promote
organization and stabilization of vascular networks by endothelial
cells, suggesting a possible pericyte function for these cells. Since
the formation of the vascular basement membrane is a hallmark of
vessel maturation [20], we next analyzed the deposition of vascular
basement membrane matrix in 3D fibrin-based constructs
prepared with RFP-HUVEC and EDK and iPDK cells 8 days
after seeding. Confocal whole mount immunofluorescence analysis
of fibrin constructs stained with antibodies specific to Type IV
Collagen (Coll4) and Laminin subunit a5 (Lam5), main constit￾uents of vascular basement membrane, revealed Coll4 and Lam5

deposition at the interface between RFP-expressing HUVEC and
EDK and iPDK cells that enveloped the vascular networks
(Fig. 6C). In addition, immunofluorescence staining of aSMA
revealed abundant aSMA-positive EDK and iPDK cells in direct
contact with RFP-HUVEC (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that
EDK and iPDK cells supported the deposition of vascular
basement membrane matrix as well as the organization of 3D
vascular networks that suggest a pericyte-like function in our
in vitro models.
EDK Cells Reduced Tissue Necrosis and Improved Blood
Perfusion when Transplanted in a Murine Model of Limb
Ischemia
To analyze whether hESC-derived mesenchymal cells could
stimulate angiogenic responses in vivo, we transplanted EDK cells
into a murine model of hindlimb ischemia that was created by
femoral artery and vein ligation in SCID mice. RGD-coupled
alginate scaffolds (Fig. 7A) were utilized as a cell delivery vehicle to
transplant EDK cells into ischemic areas to support their host
integration [21]. Blank alginate scaffolds (n = 5) and alginate
scaffolds seeded with 0.56106 of EDK cells (n = 5) were
transplanted subcutaneously into the area of femoral artery
ligation (Fig. 7B) and the mice were followed for 6 weeks post￾transplantation. Hindlimbs subjected to surgery were visually
examined at 1 and 3 days and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery
and scored based on the evaluation of degree of necrosis
(5 = normal 4 = presenting nail discoloration, 3 = multiple necrotic
toes, 2 = necrotic foot, 1 = necrotic leg, 0 = complete amputation).
Visual examination of hindlimbs revealed that mice treated with
blank scaffolds rapidly suffered from necrosis and loss of the
ischemic hindlimbs within three days after surgery, and could not
be used for any further analysis (Fig. 7B, 7C). In contrast,
transplantation of EDK cells greatly limited such autoamputation
and the overall degree of necrosis was reduced (Fig. 7B, 7C). By 4
weeks after surgery, ischemic hindlimbs in EDK group stabilized
at either the necrotic foot or necrotic leg stage (Fig. 7C). To
analyse the perfusion of ischemic hindlimb after cell transplanta￾tion, Laser Dopler Perfusion Image (LDPI) analysis was performed
at 1 day and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery. Femoral artery and
vein ligation led to a rapid loss of perfusion in the ligated limbs as
animals treated with blank scaffolds demonstrated rapid limb
necrosis and no perfusion images were obtained. Animals treated
with EDK cells demonstrated rapid loss of blood perfusion linked
to induction of hindlimb ischemia (,30% of normal perfusion
levels), which stayed constant for 2 weeks following surgery
(Fig. 7D). By 4 weeks, significant blood flow recovery was observed
in EDK group reaching ,60% of normal perfusion levels
(Fig. 7D). These findings demonstrated that transplantation of
EDK cells activated angiogenic responses in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Adult dermal-derived human blood microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC) were purchased from Lonza Inc. (Lonza, Basel,
CH). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and RFP￾expressing HUVEC (RFP-HUVEC) were purchased from Angio￾Proteomie (Angio-Proteomie, Boston, USA). All endothelial cells
were expanded and maintained on tissue culture plastic in EGM￾2MV media (Lonza, Basel, CH). EDK and iPDK cell lines were
differentiated from the H9 hESC cell line and an iPSC line derived
from BJ fibroblasts as previously described [15,16]. The H9 line of
hESC was purchased from the WiCell Institute (Madison, WI).
For all experiments, EDK and iPDK cell lines were grown on
Type I Collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in
NHK media consisting of 3:1 DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), 5% FCII (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 0.18 mM adenine, 8 mM
HEPES, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 10210 M cholera toxin,
10 ng/mL EGF, 5 mg/mL insulin (all from Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). All cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma
contamination using MycoAlertH Mycoplasma detection kit
(Lonza, Rockland, ME).
Flow Cytometry
Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and re-suspended in 2% FBS in
PBS. Cell suspensions were stained with PE-conjugated anti￾CD73, -CD105, -CD140b, -CD146 - or Isotype control-IgG1k
(BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) for 30 min on ice. For aSMA
staining, cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and fixed in 0.01%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 0.5% Saponin, and
stained with anti-aSMA primary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugatedgoat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All data were
acquired using a FACSCalibur (BD, San Jose, CA) and analyzed
using CellQuest (BD, San Jose, CA) and Summit V4.3 software
(Dako, Carpentaria, CA). Analysis was performed on 20,000 cells
per sample and results are representative of two independent
experiments.

Real-time RT-PCR
RNA was isolated using QiagenRNeasy purification kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and then converted to cDNA with the
iScriptcDNA synthesis kit (Biorad, Hercules, CA) using 0.5 mg
RNA. PCR reactions were done in triplicate with 26 SYBR￾greenSupermix (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and run on a iQ5 Real￾Time PCR detection system (Bioad, Hercules, CA). Error bars
represent standard deviation of 3 biological replicates. The primer
sequences for the genes used in this study are listed in Table S1.
Antibody-based Cytokine Array
EDK and iPDK 106 cells were plated onto 100 mm plates in
tissue culture media and grown to 80–90% confluence. All cells
were fed with 5 ml of fresh tissue culture media 24 hours prior the
experiment. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested, and the
supernatants from the plates containing equal cell numbers were
processed using Proteome Profiler Human Angiogenesis Antibody
Array (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufac￾turer’s protocol. Histogram profiles were generated by quantifying
the mean spot pixel densities from the array membranes using

Maryland, USA) and plotted as percentages of the respective
internal positive controls. For angiogenesis array alignment and
coordinates see Table S2.
ELISA
Cells were grown either in normoxic or hypoxic conditions (1%
O2) for 48 hours. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested and
processed using DuoSetVEGF, HGF and IL-8 ELISA kits (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Media was assayed in triplicates from at least three independent
samples. The values were normalized according to cell numbers
counted in the respective cultures at the time of supernatant
harvesting and expressed in pg/ml per 104 cells.
3D In Vitro Sprouting Assay
3D in vitro sprouting assay was performed using HMVEC￾coated dextran beads embedded in fibrin gel in a 24-well plate as
previously described [22]. The composition of the fibrin gel in
each well was 0.68 mg fibrinogen, 11.4 mg aprotinin, 0.455 U
thrombin (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 393 mL of PBS and
57 mL of basal EGM-2MV. The basal EGM-2MV media
containing VEGF (50 ng/ml), or the basal EGM-2MV media
containing EDK or iPDK cells (0.56104
cells/cm2
) were added
into each well and incubated for 48 h. After 48 h, the gels were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized with an Olympus
IX2 microscope. Sprouts were identified as continuous multi￾cellular structures extended from the microcarrier beads with a
minimum of two cells in the structure.
Preparation of 3D Vascular Networks
3D vascular networks were prepared as previously described
[23]. RFP-HUVEC 0.36106
, 0.156106
, or 0.066106
and P-EDK
or P-iPDK 0.066106 were mixed together, pelleted, and
resuspended with 60 ml of fibrin solution. The composition of
the fibrin solution in each was 7 mg/ml fibrinogen, 50 mg/ml
aprotinin, and 20 U/ml thrombin (all from Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). Mixtures were pipetted into glass-bottom 12-well plates and
incubated at 37uC for 15 min to gel. EGM-2MV media (Lonza,
Basel, CH) was added into each well and incubated for 7 h. Media
were changed every other day.
GFP Labelling of EDK and iPDK Cells
Lentiviral particles carrying GFP (gift of the lab of Dr. Larry
Feig. Tufts University) were generated in 293FT cells using
ViraPowerTM Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The pLenti-CMV￾GFP-puro vector was purchased from Addgene (Addgene, Cam￾bridge, MA). GFP-P-EDK and GFP-P-iPDK cell lines were
generated by infection of 50,000 cells with 1 MOI of lentivirus
carrying GFP sequence. Stable cell lines were selected with
puromycin (2 mg/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging
3D fibrin constructs were scanned by LeicaTM TCS SP2
confocal microscope after 1, 4, and 8 days in culture. Laser
excitation wavelengths included 488 nm and 561 nm. Emission
spectrum was freely tunable between 425 nm and 740 nm.
Sample scanning was recorded every 10 mm for 620 magnifica￾tion, and every 1 mm for 640 magnification. For immunofluores￾cence, 3D fibrin constructs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min, permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min,

and immersed overnight in blocking solution containing 10% goat
serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4uC. Constructs were stained
overnightwith anti-Type IV Collagen(Sigma, St. Louis, MO),
Laminin5 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and aSMA (Abcam, Cam￾bridge, MA) primary antibodies followed by 3 h incubation with
Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Quantification of 3D Vascular Networks
3D fibrin constructs were scanned by LeicaTM TCS SP2
confocal microscope after 8 days in culture using 620 lens
generating 2562.5 optical slices of 10 mm each. The resulting
image stacks of RFP-HUVEC were subjected to a series of image
analyses using SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments,
Sterling Heights, MI). Vessel length was calculated between
proximity branches. Vessel thickness was calculated in the middle
of each sprout. Two independent constructs and three z-stacks of
images taken at different focus depths per construct were analyzed
for each condition.
Preparation of RGD-coupled Alginate Scaffolds
Alginate scaffolds were prepared using high molecular weight
(,250 kDa) ultrapure sodium alginate powder (Novamatrix
Pronova UP MVG alginate) enriched ($60%) in G blocks as
previously described [21]. Briefly, a 2% w/v alginate solution in
dH2O was oxidized to 1% with sodium periodate to create
hydrolytically labile bonds in the polymer. Oxidized alginates were
coupled with oligopeptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp cell
adhesion sequence (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Richmond,
VA) following aqueous carbodiimide chemistry. Hydrogels were
prepared by mixing the alginate solution with calcium sulfate
slurry and the mixture was injected between glass plates with a
spacer of 1 mm. After curing for 20 min, gel disks with diameter of
10 mm were punched out. These gel disks were frozen and stored
at 220uC, and after 24 h, gel disks were lyophilized to yield
macroporous materials.
Ischemic Hindlimb Model in SCID Mouse
All procedures were carried out at Harvard University and were
approved by the Experimental Animal Committee of Harvard
University. SCID mice were subjected to femoral artery and vein
ligation to induce hindlimb ischemia. Immediately after ligation
cell-loaded alginate scaffolds (56106 cells per scaffold) or control
blank scaffolds were transplanted on the medial side of thigh
muscle. Before the surgery (day 0), and 1 day, 7 days, 2, 4 and 6
weeks postsurgery, hindlimbs subjected to surgery were visually
examined, and each received a score based on the evaluation of
the degree of necrosis. Measurements of the ischemic/normal limb
blood flow ratio were performed on anesthetized animals (n = 5/
time point/experimental condition) using a Periscan system blood
perfusion monitor laser Doppler equipment (Perimed Instruments,
Ardmore, PA).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics
19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). All results are reported as mean
6 standard deviation of at least three independent samples.
Statistical comparison between two groups was performed using
Student’s t-test. When comparing more than two groups One-Way
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used followed by the post
hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Results were considered
significant for p#0.05.
Discussion
Cell-based therapies are currently generating a great deal of
interest to more effectively treat ischemic diseases. Previous studies
have shown that the most effective strategies to promote
neovascularization involve co-delivery of endothelial cells with
supporting stromal cells that control functional properties of the
developing capillaries [24]. However, neither an optimal source
nor optimal type of stromal cells that support angiogenic responses
has been defined so far. In light of this, human pluripotent stem
cells, such as hESC and hiPSC, provide plentiful and renewable
cell sources for derivation of stromal cell types that manifest
properties important for the induction of angiogenic responses
during tissue regeneration.
There are a number of studies that have shown the derivation of
MSC-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells that express
phenotypic markers of pericytes, support formation of endothelial
networks in vitro and promote re-vascularization of ischemic tissues
in vivo [12–14]. We have extended these findings to demonstrate
that fibroblasts derived from hESC and hiPSC (EDK and iPDK,
respectively) using our differentiation protocol manifest a more
diverse repertoire of cellular features that support angiogenesis.
Comparative studies of EDK and iPDK cells demonstrated that
both, hESC and hiPSC-derived fibroblasts show similar patterns of
gene expression, secretion of pro-angiogenic growth factors and
functional angiogenic outcomes. This suggests that our directed
differentiation approach allows differentiation of angiogenic
stromal cells from human pluripotent stem cells with high
reproducibility and efficiency.
Functional recovery of ischemic tissue, such as an ischemic limb
and heart by pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal progen￾itor cells have been previously reported [12,13,25,26]. However,
the mechanism by which these cells may contribute to the repair of
ischemic tissues remains somewhat controversial. One possibility is
that multipotent progenitor cells are capable of incorporating into
mature vasculature by differentiating into pericytes and smooth
muscle cells. A second option is that the various stromal cell types
secrete distinct pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines that enhance
angiogenesis and augment blood flow to ischemic tissue. Although
the homing of transplanted hESC-derived MSCs into ischemic
tissues has been reported [26], the findings of low proliferation and
the limited survival of transplanted cells appear to support the
paracrine hypothesis. Several studies have demonstrated the
paracrine effects of adult tissue-derived MSC including bone￾marrow and adipose tissue-derived MSCs, both in vitro and in vivo
[27–32]. For example, pro-angiogenic growth factors and cyto￾kines, such as VEGF, HGF, bFGF, Ang-1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and
others, have been identified within in vito secretome of adult tissue￾derived MSCs [27,28,32]. Paracrine contribution of adult tissue￾derived MSC in vivo has also been demonstrated in a murine
model of hind limb ischemia [27], where MSCs promoted the
recovery of ischemic limb through secretion of pro-angiogenic
growth factors, specifically VEGF that was detected in situ around
3D vascular networks formed within fibrin matrix following seeding of RFP-HUVEC mixed with EDK and iPDK at ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1 (collapsed Z￾stacks of total 250625 mm). Bar, 100 mm. C. Quantification of vessel length and thickness of 3D vascular networks formed within fibrin constructs

the transplanted cells [27]. However, the paracrine effects of
hESC- and hiPSC-derived stromal cells have not been fully
explored.
To gain insight into the mechanism by which hESC- and iPSC￾derived fibroblasts may contribute to angiogenic responses, we
analyze the secretion profiles of EDK and iPDK cells in vitro, by
focusing on factors that activate and promote angiogenesis.
Importantly, both EDK and iPDK cells demonstrated very similar
secretory profiles of angiogenic factors showing elevated levels of
VEGF, Ang-1, PDGF-AA, HGF, AR, Endostatin, and TIMP-4
when compared to control, BJ fibroblasts. These findings indicate
that these paracrine factors may play an important role in
angiogenic process mediated by EDK and iPDK cells. Indeed,
when incorporated into 3D in vitro angiogenesis assay in a medium
devoid of growth factors, angiogenic factors secreted by EDK and
iPDK cells induced sprouting of microvascular endothelial cells
(HMVEC), thus indicating their potential to activate therapeutic
angiogenesis. Beyond this, transplantation of EDK cells to
ischemic hindlimbs demonstrated similar injury responses that
were characterized by increased blood perfusion over time and
constructs at day 1, 4, and 8 co-cultures (collapsed Z-stacks of total 250625 mm). Bars, 50 mm. B. Confocal images taken at higher magnification

partial recovery of ischemic limbs. These results demonstrated the
potential of hESC-and hiPSC-derived fibroblasts to induce
neovascularization in vivo. Additional in vivo studies will be
necessary to further establish the role that EDK and iPDK play
in this vascular response.
In order to explore the correlation between developing origin of
EDK and iPDK cells and phenotype to angiogenic properties, we
analyzed the ontogeny of these cells following their differentiation
from pluripotent stem cells. Analysis of the ontogeny of these cells
revealed markers that are reminiscent of pericytes, including NG2,
PDGFRb, aSMA, CD73, and CD105, that may help explain the
angiogenic outcomes we found in vitro and in vivo. We found the
expression of these markers shortly after BMP4 treatment that
occurred concomitant with the transient induction of FLK1/
VEGFR2+
, CD34+ and CD31+
. We have shown that expression of
the pericyte marker CD146 was not dependent on BMP4
treatment and remained stable throughout differentiation. Analysis
of mesodermal and neural crest progenitor markers showed that
BMP4 treatment promoted expression of mesodermal markers
GATA4, T (Brachyury homolog), and MSGN1 at the expense of
neural crest markers p75 (NTR), HNK1, and Sox10.
A pericyte-like functionality of EDK and iPDK cells was further
established in our co-culture experiments, as seen by the direct
interaction between EDK and iPDK cells and endothelial cells in
3D fibrin-based tissue constructs, and by the ability of these cells to
promote the formation of the vascular network. These results are
consistent with previous reports showing that pericytes contribute
to endothelial cell proliferation and survival and promote
endothelial sprouting [2,3,33]. Confocal immunofluorescent anal￾ysis of vascular networks further demonstrated the deposition of
Type IV Collagen and Laminin 5 at the interface between
endothelial cells and EDK and iPDK, indicating the formation of
vascular basement membrane. These results are consistent with
previous reports showing that, in mature vasculature, pericytes
provide supporting functions, including stabilization of blood
vessels, formation of permeability barrier and deposition of
vascular basement membrane proteins [14,34,35]. These results
suggest that pericyte-like phenotype of hESC- and iPSC-derived
fibroblasts is a key to controlling their ability to promote
angiogenesis and to provide supporting functions for maturing
vasculature.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that highly angio￾genic cells can be generated with high efficiency and purity from
pluripotent stem cells using our directed differentiation system.
These cells display a pericyte-like phenotype and stimulate and
support different stages of the angiogenic process. Considering the
limtations associated with the isolation and use of mesenchymal
progenitor cells and pericytes from existing sources, such as limited
growth and cell heterogeneity, the isolation of hESC- and hiPSC￾derived fibroblasts that support angiogenesis may inform new
advances in regenerative therapies.
