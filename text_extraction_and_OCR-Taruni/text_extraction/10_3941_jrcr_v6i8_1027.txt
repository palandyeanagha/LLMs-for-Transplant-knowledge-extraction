ABSTRACT
Inguinal herniation of ureter is an uncommon finding that can potentially 
lead to obstructive uropathy. We report a case of inguinal herniation of 
ureter discovered incidentally during workup for acute renal failure and 
ultrasound finding of hydronephrosis.
CASE REPORT
The patient was a 76 year old male who presented with 5-
6 week history of intermittent left upper quadrant, left flank 
pain, dysuria, nausea, and fever. Past medical history was 
significant for motor vehicle accident approximately 20 years 
ago resulting in multiple pelvic surgeries and left renal trauma 
that led to a non-functional left kidney after that. On 
admission, laboratory investigations showed an elevated 
creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, increased from his baseline 
creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL.
Ultrasound evaluation on admission showed an atrophic 
left kidney and a large left perinephric abscess as well as right 
renal pelviectasis (Figure 1). Percutaneous drainage of the left 
perinephric abscess was performed. Followup renal ultrasound 
performed 6 days later showed partial resolution of left 
perirenal fluid collection and redemonstration of right renal 
pelviectasis. A CT urogram was performed to further evaluate 
his right kidney and ureter. 
CT scan demonstrated atrophic left kidney with air-fluid 
collection inferior to the lower pole of the left kidney. A
percutaneous drain had been previously placed within this 
fluid collection (Figure 6). Evaluation of the right kidney 
showed dilated renal pelvis without calyceal dilatation. There 
was no effacement of the renal pelvic fat. The proximal ureter 
appeared dilated but tapered down to normal caliber without 
evidence of obstruction. These findings were consistent with 
an extra-renal pelvis. Delayed phase evaluation of the distal 
ureter with 3-D reconstruction showed prolapse of the ureter 
into the right inguinal canal, where it made a U-turn back up 
towards and connecting to the bladder (Figures 2, 4, and 5). 
Bilateral inguinal hernia sacs were noted (figure 3), and the 
contrast-filled herniated ureter was seen medial to the hernia 
sac. This is consistent with a paraperitoneal, acquired type of 
inguinal ureteral hernia.
 
Herniation of ureter into the inguinal canal has been 
reported as a complication of renal transplant as well as 
spontaneous herniation of native ureter [1, 7]. Herniation of 
native ureter into the inguinal canal is a rare finding, with 
approximately 140 cases reported in literature as of 2009 [1]. 
It is usually an indirect inguinal hernia [5] and is divided into 
paraperitoneal type and extraperitoneal type, with the 
paraperitoneal type being more common (approximately 80% 
of all cases) [2]. 
In the paraperitoneal type, a loop of ureter is extended 
alongside a peritoneal sac. The herniated ureter is adherent to 
the posterior peritoneum, both of which are present in the 
hernia. It is a sliding type of hernia that is thought to be due to 
traction of underlying structures or adhesions that attach the 
ureter to the posterior peritoneum. Paraperitoneal type of 
ureteral hernia is believed to be acquired. Herniated bowel 
may also be present. It has been noted that the ureteral loop is 
located medial to the peritoneal sac, and when the ureter is 
extended into the scrotum it is more likely to be obstructed [3].
In contrast to the paraperitoneal type of ureteral hernia, 
the extraperitoneal type is thought to be due to a congenital 
embryonic defect that results in fusion between the ureter and 
the genitoinguinal ligaments. It is theorized to be the result of

failure of separation of the ureteric bud from the Wolffian 
duct, both of which are then drawn down to the scrotum to 
form the epididymis and vas deferens [1, 3]. As such, in the 
extraperitoneal type of inguinal ureteral hernia the ureter 
herniates without peritoneum attached to it. 
There has been one case report of an extraperitoneal 
ureteral hernia that was thought to be possibly due to 
adhesions from previous hernia repair [6], but in general the 
extraperitoneal type of inguinal ureteral hernia is thought to be 
congenital. It has been noted that in the extraperitoneal type of 
inguinal hernia there is often a large amount of fat tissue 
within the hernia [6]. While the distinction between 
paraperitoneal and extraperitoneal types of inguinal ureteral 
hernia is classically made during surgical exploration, CT 
urogram provides a non-invasive method to determine the 
hernia type. 
Although rare, inguinal ureteral hernia can cause 
obstructive uropathy, and herinorrhaphy is indicated in these 
cases to relieve the obstruction. In our patient, the herniated 
ureter is not causing obstruction, with the proximal ureteral 
dilatation due to extra-renal pelvis. His symptoms and acute 
renal failure are attributable to his left renal atrophy and acute 
infection. His creatinine level gradually improved during his 
hospital stay until it was back to baseline. Thus a conservative 
approach with observation was chosen regarding his herniated 
right ureter. The patient was discharged in good condition. 
Subsequent followup showed that the patient is doing well 
with stable renal function.
Inguinal hernia of the ureter is a rare finding that may be 
acquired or congenital and may lead to obstructive uropathy, 
and the inguinal ureter is prone to injury during herniorrhaphy. 
CT urogram with 3-D reconstruction provide good anatomic 
details that can diagnose the presence of a herniated ureter.

Figure 2: Extra renal pelvis and inguinal herniation of the 
right ureter. The patient is a 76 year old male presenting with 
acute renal failure. Here is an oblique reconstructed CT image 
showing a dilated renal pelvis with intact renal pelvic fat and 
gradual tapering of the proximal ureter consistent with an 
extrarenal pelvis. The ureter is seen going into the inguinal 
canal. There is no evidence of ureteral obstruction. This study 
was performed using GE LightSpeed 16-slice CT scanner 
using kV 140 and mA 379. 40 cc in intravenous Visipaque was 
injected at time 0. At 5 minutes an additional 120 cc of 
Visipaque was injected. At 7 minutes a combined 
nephrographic/execretory phase helical CT was performed of 
the abdomen and pelvis using 0.625 mm collimation with 2.5 
mm axial reconstructions and 3 mm bilateral oblique 
reconstructions.

Etiology Extraperitoneal type – congenital; failure of separation of ureteric bud from Wolffian duct. Ureter 
descends with testes.
Paraperitoneal type – slides along with inguinal hernia sac. Questionable relationship with prior surgery 
and trauma.
Incidence Rare; approximately 140 cases reported to date.
Gender ratio Extraperitoneal type only occurs in males.
Paraperitoneal type likely reflects the gender ratio of inguinal hernias, which is 25:1. Femoral herniation 
of the ureter has been reported in female patients.
Age predilection Extraperitoneal type is present since birth. However, they may not present until later in life.
Paraperitoneal type tends to present in older patients.
Risk factors Male gender. Prior surgery and trauma may be a questionable risk factor for paraperitoneal type.
Treatment Signs of obstructive uropathy warrant surgical correction of the hernia. Watchful waiting is reasonable in 
cases with no evidence of obstruction.
Prognosis Depends on the timing of surgery to relief obstructive uropathy; early diagnosis and treatment improves 
prognosis.
Findings on 
imaging
Ultrasound may show signs of obstruction (i.e. Pelvicaliectasis). 
CT urography will show ureter going into the inguinal canal. Presence of a hernia sac with herniated ureter 
medial to the sac is suggestive of paraperitoneal type of inguinal ureteral hernia.
