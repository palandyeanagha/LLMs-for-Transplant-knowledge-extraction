Pregnancy in a liver transplant patient 
treated with everolimus and tacrolimus
To the Editor,
We appreciated the paper regarding the quality of life in 
patients after liver transplantation (LT) by Domingos et al. [1], 
recently published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal and Liver 
Diseases. The authors reported a similar or superior quality 
of life in LT patients compared to the general population. 
Due to advances in immunology and transplant medicine, 
women with a history of LT could have successful pregnancies. 
However, data on pregnancy outcomes is still limited, especially 
for women with a history of liver graft failure, receiving 
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. 
Recently, many studies focused on everolimus benefits in 
the immunosuppression regimen after LT, which might be 
initiated early post-LT or in later monitoring phases, allowing 
the calcineurin inhibitor reduction [2]. Published reports 
on pregnant women exposed to tacrolimus documented no 
increased risk of malformations, but data on pregnancy under 
everolimus is still relatively scarce [3, 4]. 
We report a good clinical outcome of an unplanned 
pregnancy in a LT female patient aged 30 under everolimus 
and tacrolimus immunosuppression therapy. 
The patient had a successful LT at 20-year old for 
decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by Wilson disease. The 
recipient received tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy 
for 5 years with stable graft liver function. In 2016, at 25-years 
old, she had an unplanned pregnancy discovered at 8 weeks 
of gestation. The immunosuppressive therapy was reduced 
and then completely stopped by the patient herself, during 
the second semester of pregnancy. At 27 weeks of pregnancy 
she was admitted in the hospital with high levels of bilirubin 
(total bilirubin 10.7 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 9 mg/dl, 
upper normal value 1 mg/dl), mild cholestasis and elevated 
aminotransferase levels (8 times the upper normal limit). The 
liver biopsy depicted mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate 
in the portal space with disappearance of bile ducts and

perivenular mononuclear inflammation in the terminal hepatic 
venules, corresponding to chronic liver graft rejection. The 
patient received tacrolimus and pulse therapy with solumedrol, 
with no benefit. She had a cesarean section at 29 weeks of 
pregnancy (the newborn presented Apgar score 7, respiratory 
distress syndrome, and no congenital malformations). The 
chronic rejection was successfully managed after delivery, by 
adding 2 mg of everolimus (blood trough levels 3-8 ng/mL) to 
tacrolimus (blood trough levels of 3-5ng/ml).
In 2020 she had the second unplanned pregnancy, 
discovered at 7 weeks. The patient was carefully monitored 
by the obstetrician and the hepatologist. She received lower 
doses of everolimus (1.5 mg/day and decreased to 1 mg/daily 
from the 28 weeks of gestation) and lower doses of tacrolimus 
(4.5 mg/day), with normal liver graft function. Ultrasound 
monitoring did not detect any fetus abnormalities. Considering 
her history of chronic graft liver rejection, a cesarean section 
was scheduled at 34 weeks to balance between the mother risk 
for graft rejection and the optimal time for fetus delivery. The 
newborn weighted 2,250 g had an Apgar score 8 and presented 
respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure for which 
surfactant administration and non-invasive respiratory support 
were ensured; no clinical signs of malformations were reported. 
The patient and her newborn were in good clinical condition 
at 3 months follow-up. 
Although mTOR inhibitors have been reported to increase 
the fetus mortality in experimental animals, no teratogenic 
effects have been seen either in rats or rabbits [3]. As the 
teratogenic risk cannot be ruled out, the guidelines recommend 
that another drug be used as a substitute for mTOR inhibitors. 
The antiproliferative effect of mTOR inhibitors might prevent 
maturing of the fetus [4]. The mTOR signaling in the fetal 
liver, trophoblast, and decidua serves as a critical hub in the 
overall homeostatic control of fetal growth [5]. In the fetal liver 
mTORs regulate the secretion and phosphorylation of insulin￾like growth factor binding protein 1, thereby controlling the 
bioavailability of growth hormones [5]. In the placenta, mTORs 
respond to a large number of growth-related signals and in 
the maternal compartment, mTORs are an integral part of

a decidual nutrient sensor, connecting oxygen and nutrient 
availability to the growth hormones. Based on these scientific 
reports our patient was exposed to lower doses of everolimus 
during the second pregnancy.
This presentation reports a good clinical outcome 
for a newborn exposed to everolimus and tacrolimus 
immunosuppressive therapy for LT.

The use of a proton pump inhibitor does not 
increase the risk of colorectal cancer: a meta￾analysis
To the Editor,
The association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
use and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial 
in literature [1-10]. We summarize the existing evidence on 
the risk of CRC in patients with PPIs use by conducting a 
meta-analysis.
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web 
of science for studies evaluating the association of PPIs use 
with the risk of CRC until July 2020. The following key words 
were used: ‘proton pump inhibitor’, ‘PPI’, ‘lansoprazole’, 
‘dexlansoprazole’, ‘esomeprazole’, ‘pantoprazole’, ‘omeprazole’, 
rabeprazole’, ‘colon cancer’, ‘colon neoplasm’, ‘colon tumor’, 
‘colon carcinoma’, ‘rectal cancer’, ‘rectal neoplasm’, ‘rectal 
tumor’, ‘rectal carcinoma’, ‘colorectal cancer’, ‘colorectal 
neoplasm’, ‘colorectal tumor’, ‘colorectal carcinoma’. Boolean 
operators, such as ‘OR’ and ‘AND’, were used to combine the 
above keywords. No language restrictions and manually search 
for references in included studies.
The following content criteria were used to select studies for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis: (1) the association of PPIs use 
with the risk of CRC was evaluated; (2) sufficient data to allow 
calculation of odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI) was provided. Studies with insufficient data were excluded. 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding each study in 
turn. Egger’s test quantified the publication bias.
A total of 3,431 articles were initially collected. After 
removing 1,059 duplicates, 2,372 articles remained. After 
screening title and abstract, ten articles that explored the 
relationship between PPI use and CRC risk published between 
2007 and 2020 were selected [1-10]. Among them, eight were 
published in full text [1, 3, 4, 6-10], one was a conference 
abstract [5], and another was a letter [2]. All included articles 
underwent a qualitative and quantitative assessment. The basic 
information of included articles is displayed in Supplementary 
Table I.
We identified three cohort and seven case-control studies 
including 1,069,716 participants (Supplementary Table I). 
Eight studies were conducted in Europe and America, and 
two in Asia. Pooled results showed that there was no obvious 
association of PPIs use with the risk of CRC (OR 1.22, 
95%CI 0.93-1.62, p =0.154) (Fig. 1). The results did not differ 
significantly from the overall analysis based on sensitivity 
analysis, revealing that the outcome was stable. No significant 
bias was detected (p=0.918, Egger’s test). The subgroup analysis 
[study type (cohort study or case-control study), sample size 
(> 50000 or ≤ 50000), cumulative use of PPIs (> 5 year or ≥ 10 
years)] showed the ORs consistent with the overall analysis. 
The 95%CI lower limit of combined OR gradually approached 
1 with the extension of medication time (duration of PPIs 
use ≥ 10 years: OR 1.11, 95%CI 0.84-1.46; duration of PPIs 
use> 5years: OR 1.25, 95%CI 0.80-1.97), which may indicate 
a gradual increased risk of CRC. 
There are several limitations in our meta-analysis. Firstly, 
all included studies are retrospective. Secondly, considering 
the heterogeneity among the meta-analysis, the results should 
be treated with caution. Thirdly, most of the patients are from 
Europe and America. Finally, no adjustment was performed 
concerning the family history of CRC, which is one of the most 
important risk of CRC. 
 Despite these limitations, the meta-analysis also has some 
advantages. Firstly, our study included more than four times 
as many patients as previous meta-analyses [11, 12], and the 
results had higher statistical power and were more persuasive. 
Secondly, based on sensitivity analysis the results were stable. 
Furthermore, there was no possible publication bias. More 
importantly, we found that the risk of CRC might increase 
with prolonged PPIs use.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that use of PPIs 
does not increase the risk of CRC, which is consistent with 
the other two studies [11,12]. However, the risk of CRC 
may gradually increase with long-term PPI use. CRC is a

progressive disease that takes many years from the initiation 
to the progression to cancer. Therefore, with the extension of 
PPIs use time, people would expect to see an increased CRC 
risk become obvious. Multi-area randomized controlled studies 
are required to confirm our results.

Micro-elimination of hepatitis C virus 
infection - the beginning of the end
To the Editor,
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of 
chronic liver disease and liver-related deaths, worldwide [1]. 
The revolution in HCV treatment with direct acting antiviral 
agents (DAAs) since 2014 has entirely changed the landscape of 
HCV therapy. A disease that was cured only in less than half of 
patients with a long therapy and with side effects is now a disease 
that can be eradicated in 8-12 weeks, almost in all patients, 
with all-oral interferon free regimens based on DAAs. Despite 
this triumphal therapeutic event, HCV still is a global concern, 
affecting around 71 million people worldwide [1]. This epochal 
therapeutic progress of HCV through DAAs has led to an 
immense international interest for global elimination of HCV 
as a public health threat and to the ambitious decision of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to eliminate viral 
hepatitis by 2030 (90% reduction in incidence, treatment of 80% 
patients who are eligible and 65% reduction in mortality) [1].
Romania is considered the country with the highest 
prevalence of HCV in Europe, with various reported figures 
in the last decades (5.9% in 1990, 3.23% in 2010, recently 
estimated 1.39%) [2-4]. Moldavia is a Romanian province with 
the highest prevalence of HCV [3].
To fulfil the WHO targets each country should have its 
individual plan as there is no “one size-fits-all” approach [5]. 
Thus, several strategies have been proposed. One is micro￾elimination, a concept that breaks down the national elimination 
goals into smaller, easier to accomplish tasks such as specific 
subpopulations (prisoners, people with haemophilia or HIV, 
hemodialysis, transplant recipients, people who inject drugs, men 
who have sex with men) as well as geographical areas (regions, 
cities, villages). The community-based strategy combined 
educational campaign, testing and treatment [4]. We adopted 
such a strategy in a project designed to educate, test and treat 
HCV with the aim of eliminating HCV infection in all adults, in 
a village named Vetrisoaia, located in Eastern Romania, in the 
Moldavia province, Vaslui county, a region considered as having 
a poor socioeconomic level, with difficult access to healthcare 
system. A mobile team of gastroenterologists, residents and 
nurses from the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 
St. Spiridon Hospital Iasi was created and undertook community 
mobilization with the aid of the local leadership (mayor, village 
council, general practitioners, teachers, priest). Our project was 
carried out between 1st March 2019-31st December 2019. The adult 
population of Vetrisoaia, comprising 3,507 people were invited to 
be tested by direct communication, house-to-house. For certain 
situations, the screening was organized at a household level, this 
being one of the reasons for the high coverage of the village. 
The screening was made using rapid diagnostic orientation 
tests: 2,945 (84%) subjects were tested and 78 (2.64%) were 
found with positive HCV antibodies and were scheduled for 
further evaluation in our hospital, in order to be linked to care. 
Out of sixty-six (85%) presented for evaluation, 55 (83%) had 
HCV RNA detectable and 25% had advanced fibrosis (F3/F4). 
Fifty-four (98%) completed antiviral treatment and 53 (99%) 
obtained sustained virological response (SVR). 
To our knowledge this project is the first in Romania and 
among only a few in Europe. A similar project was performed 
in Egypt [6]. This proof-of-concept study could inspire similar 
projects in Romania and other countries, which have a high 
percentage of rural populations.

Liver injury in COVID-19 patients - a 
multidisciplinary experience and a call for 
national consensus
To the Editor, 
We read with considerable interest the recent detailed 
systematic review and meta-analysis by Xin et al. [1] published 

Letters to the Editor 689
J Gastrointestin Liver Dis, December 2020 Vol. 29 No 4: 685-693
in the Journal of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases, on the 
abnormal liver function tests of patients with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Mainland China. In their study, 
the severity of COVID-19 was associated with liver damage and 
could be a risk factor for abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). 
We also focus on the impact of abnormal liver function on the 
prognosis of COVID-19, by presenting a multidisciplinary 
approach.
By the end of September 2020, COVID-19 had affected 
more than 31 million patients worldwide, with a mortality 
rate of approximately 4% [2] and still represents an important 
medical challenge for physicians worldwide [3, 4]. 
We performed a retrospective, single-centre, observational 
study of 1,479 patients confirmed with COVID-19, admitted to 
Mureș County Clinical Hospital, designated as a support hospital, 
in three different Departments: Gastroenterology, Infectious 
Diseases and Intensive Care Unit. The observed patients were 
admitted during a 6-month period (March 2020-August 2020). 
We analysed clinical features, laboratory tests, medications, 
comorbidities, clinical outcomes such as intensive care unit 
admission, discharge, death, and length of hospital stay. 
Adult patients, with a laboratory confirmation of COVID-19, 
irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, were included in 
the study. Pre-existing liver disease with a documented history 
of abnormal LFTs was the main exclusion criteria.
From a total of 1,479 patients admitted in Mureș County 
Clinical Hospital, 146 patients (9.87%) which presented 
with abnormal LFTs at admission or during the first 7 days 
of hospitalisation were included in the study. Mean age was 
48.68 years (46.54-50.82), with a male: female ratio of 1.43:1. 
No deaths were reported in our inclusion group compared to 
the total number of deaths of 85 (5.74%).
Paraclinical characteristics of patients in the severe 
COVID-19 and non-severe groups, as well as those of patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit are shown in Table I. During 
hospitalisation, the majority of patients (68.4%) presented with 
mild liver injury and median duration of liver injury was 5 
days. None of the patients with severe liver injury expressed 
normal liver function at discharge, and the predominant 
mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) related liver injury was hepatocellular (59.5%). 
The average length of hospital stay was 16.21 days (standard 
deviation 7.43) and was not statistically longer in patients with 
severe liver injury. 
Consistent with Xian et al. [1] results, this study has found 
that severe COVID-19 patients, presented early onset of liver 
injury, and a slow decrease of abnormal LFTs, with a lack of 
normalization of LFTs at discharge. Moderate to severe liver 
injury was more common in patients with severe COVID19, 
admitted to the intensive care unit. More studies are required

in order to corelate and establish the pathogenesis of LFTs 
abnormality in patients with a mild form of the disease. 
In June 2020, EASL-ESCIMD provided a consensus 
position paper [5] regarding the approach and management 
of patients with pre-existing liver disease, taking into 
consideration the fact that they represent a vulnerable cohort 
of patients. Our study emphasises the need for a consensus 
regarding the type of approach and management of SARS￾COV2 liver injury, as well as the need to follow up patients 
without any known or manifest pre-existing liver disease, but 
who present with abnormal LFTs associated with COVID-19. 
Thus, the challenge of hepatologists in the future will be to 
predict and prevent any other additional source of liver injury 
in COVID-19 patients. 
Standardized definitions and guidelines of liver damage 
management in COVID-19 are required for consultant 
hepatologists in order to clarify differential diagnosis and to 
apply a unitary measure of care [6].
Etiological investigations should be performed at an early 
stage in COVID-19 liver damage, especially in patients with a 
length of disease higher than 7 days, or in patients who present 
a rapid decrease of SARS-COV2 viral load. Close follow￾up of patients with SARS-COV2 liver injury should not be 
disregarded, even after the normalization of LFTs. A national 
consensus, as well as an updated international guideline on the 
approach of these patients is required for the improvement of 
physician care.

Occurrence and recurrence of hepatocellular 
carcinoma in patients with HCV genotype 
1b related cirrhosis treated with Ledipasvir + 
Sofosbuvir ± Ribavirin
To the Editor,
Although direct antiviral agents (DAAs) therapy for 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been revolutionary, with a 
sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of more than 90%, 
with favorable effects on improving liver function and reducing 
cirrhosis complications, the impact of treatment on de novo 
or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is 
still debated [1, 2].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and 
risk factors for occurrence and recurrence of HCC in patients 
with HCV genotype 1b related cirrhosis treated with Ledipasvir 
+ Sofosbuvir ± Ribavirin (LDV/SOF±RBV). We conducted 
a multicentric retrospective cohort study on 349 patients 
with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to HCV infection 
genotype 1b treated with LDV/SOF±RBV for 12-24 weeks from 
September 2018 to September 2019. The median follow-up 
period was 20 months (5-24).
In this cohort, 18 subjects were previously treated for 
HCC (transarterial chemoembolization in 10 cases, surgery 
in 4 and radiofrequency ablation in 4). None of these patients 
was coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patients were 
eligible for DAAs therapy if they had no imaging sign of HCC 
recurrence 3 months after the HCC treatment. At the beginning 
of DAAs treatment, the median viremic load was 196,000 IU/
mL (1,210÷6,590,000IU/mL) and SVR12 was obtained in 12 
(66.7%). The HCC recurrence appeared in 8 subjects (44.4%), 6 
of them (75%) with HCC BCLC stage A and 2 (25%) with HCC 
BCLC stage B. The median time elapsed between the last HCC 
procedure and the start of DAAs was 20 months (3-60), between 
last procedure for HCC and recurrence 25 months (13-39) and 
between start of DAAs therapy and HCC recurrence 12 months 
(6-12). The proportion of patients with HCC recurrence since 
the start of DAAs therapy is represented in Supplementary file. 
Four patients (22.2%) died during the follow up period.
The SVR rate was significantly lower in the subgroup 
of patients with recurrence compared with those without 
recurrence (50% vs. 80%, p=0.034). No statistically significant 
differences were obtained for gender, age, interval between 
HCC diagnosis and initiation of DAAs therapy, alpha￾fetoprotein value and MELD score (Supplementary file). 
The second analysis focused on HCC occurrence was 
conducted on 321 subjects (12 cases stopped the therapy to 
severe adverse reactions), divided in two subgroups: without 
HCC diagnosis during follow-up (306 patients) and with HCC 
occurrence (15 individuals). Surveillance for HCC was made

according to guidelines: liver ultrasound with alpha fetoprotein 
every 6 months [3].
After DAAs treatment, patients significantly improved 
their liver function. (Supplementary file). HCC occurred 
de novo in 15 out of 321 (4.7%) subjects. In the subgroup 
of HCC occurrence compared with the subgroup without 
HCC, a significantly lower value of platelet count (56x109
/L 
vs 95x109
/L, p=0.001), as well as albumin levels (2.8g/dL vs. 
3.4g/dL, p=0.001), a significantly higher level of bilirubin 
(2.64 mg/dL vs. 1.6 mg/dL, p=0.014) were noted. There were 
no significant differences regarding the baseline clinical 
and biological parameters, except the Child-Pugh score 
(significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with de novo 
HCC). There were no differences in the response to DAAs, 
with a similar SVR12 rate between the two groups (76.9% vs 
89.2%, p=0.171) (Supplementary file).
Our results regarding the HCC recurrence rate was 
higher than expected, 44.4% (30.6/100 patient-year) and 
the SVR rate was only 66.7%, as we included only patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis. The HCC-DAAs interval was 
between 3 to 60 months. Most of the authors recommend 
a delay of at least 6 months of DAAs therapy after HCC 
complete response [4-6]. Reig et al. [7] found 27.6% 
recurrence rate of for a median follow-up of 5.7 months, 
higher than expected, with a median period of 3.5 months 
between treatment and HCC recurrence. Cardoso et al. [8] 
found a significantly lower rate of HCC recurrence (7.4%), 
but still higher than expected, with a median follow-up of 
12 months. All the studies mentioned above had a SVR rate 
higher than 90%. Idilman et al. [9] obtained similar results: 
48.5% recurrence rate of HCC with a median follow-up of 6 
months after treatment and a statistically significant period 
of time between HCC diagnosis and DAAs treatment (24 
months without recurrence vs. 9 months with recurrence), 
that may explain the higher recurrence rate. Our HCC￾DAAs interval was 20 months in the patients with no 
HCC recurrence versus 13.5 in those recorded with HCC 
recurrence (p=NS).
In our analysis, the lack of SVR did not predict the 
occurrence of a HCC; instead, we found similar predictive 
factors with the data from the literature [10]: poor liver 
function [high Child score (p=0.007), low albumin (p=0.001) 
and high bilirubin levels (p=0.01)].The DAAs – HCC interval 
was 3-18 months, with a median length of 6 months. 
In conclusion, the recurrence rate of HCC in cirrhotic 
patients treated with LDV/SOF±RBV was 44.4% (30.6/100 
patient-year). The occurrence rate of HCC was 4.7% in a 
median follow-up period of 20 months. The predictive factors 
for the HCC occurrence were a lower platelet number and an 
impaired liver function.

Fighting Hepatitis C in a COVID-19 
ecosystem. Public health policies are needed 
more than ever
To the Editor,
One of the most important lessons that National Health 
Systems have learned with the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic was that more than clinical measures, 
diseases that depend on human behavior are primarily 
fought with targeted Public Health Policies (PHP) [1]. All the 
countries that deviated from this approach have registered the 
worst results [2]. In the opposite direction, those that most 
vigorously resorted to structured forms and with an effective 
transfer of concepts to the field were the ones that have been 
obtaining better results.
Hepatitis C is also one of the diseases in which its 
transmission depends the most on adopted behaviors of 
oneself and among communities [e.g., persons who inject drugs 
(PWID), prisoners, etc.].
The LEHC Project approach is to focus on PHP towards 
achieving the hepatitis C elimination by 2030, as proposed 
by the Sustainable Development Goals [3]. This project 
encompasses an epidemiological model based on five 
populations (PWID, prisoners, vertical transmission, blood 
products, remaining population) [4]. Each population group 
has specific dynamics and epidemiological history, with specific 
reactions to each of the twenty-four PHP focused on hepatitis 
C that were considered in the LEHC project. Modelling results 
were obtained by considering different implementation 
levels of each PHP, integrating the classic Markov Chain 
epidemiological mathematical along with a statistical one 
based on Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) that results from 
the National Experts reading about the impact of each PHP in 
a national population.
The LEHC project allows to simulate different PHP 
implementation levels, for each year until 2030, forecasting 
results in each of the five populations and the country’s total 
population. This model has been progressively implemented 
in a group of ten European countries, chosen for the diverse 
characteristics among them, with five being already completed: 
Bulgaria, Romania, Portugal, Spain and Austria.
For the total population in Bulgaria, it is estimated that in 
2019 there were close to 67,800 hepatitis C cases (distributed 
by: PWID=42,200; prisoners 6,200; blood products 1,600; 
remaining population 17,800).
According to the LEHC model, Bulgaria can further 
intensify eleven PHP measures. Focusing on PHP related to 
Awareness and Prevention, as well as Testing and Diagnosis, it 
would be possible to have the most impact in reducing HCV 
infection cases in Bulgaria. Despite Bulgaria’s broad resource 
allocation and current PHP directed to eliminate hepatitis C by 
2030, results from the LEHC model suggest that the country will 
not achieve the goal established by WHO in that year. However, 
by testing the implementation of all the PHP considered in the 
LEHC project, forecasts suggest that the elimination goal can 
be attained as soon as 2029. Further implementing PHP to 
shorten the necessary time to achieve the HCV elimination goal 
has also been verified in a recent published article about the 
LEHC model application in Romania [5]. This reading is also 
aligned with the obtained results for the remaining countries 
with complete LEHC modelling, with corresponding articles 
being also under submission.
Modelled data were produced previously to the COVID-19 
pandemic. We see with enormous concern that hepatitis C may 
be one of the most punished diseases by COVID-19: the drastic 
reduction on the number of aerosol generating procedures 
across Europe; human, monetary and technical resources are 
diverted to assist the COVID-19 emergency, being known that 
hepatitis C is formed mainly by stigmatized populations, hence 
where decision-making powers are more prone to decrease 
investment without great public impact. Therefore, we consider 
that COVID-19 is a huge threat to the fulfillment of the WHO 
elimination goal for hepatitis C, which may only be countered 
by a strong defense of what was already positively worked.
