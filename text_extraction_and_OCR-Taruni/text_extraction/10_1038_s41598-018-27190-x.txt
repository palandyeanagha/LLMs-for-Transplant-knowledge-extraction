A System of Cytokines 
Encapsulated in ExtraCellular 
Vesicles

Cytokines are soluble factors that mediate cell–cell communications in multicellular organisms. 
Recently, another system of cell–cell communication was discovered, which is mediated by extracellular 
vesicles (EVs). Here, we demonstrate that these two systems are not strictly separated, as many 
cytokines in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo are released in EV-encapsulated forms and are capable of eliciting 
biological effects upon contact with sensitive cells. Association with EVs is not necessarily a property 
of a particular cytokine but rather of a biological system and can be changed upon system activation. 
EV-encapsulated cytokines were not detected by standard cytokine assays. Deciphering the regulatory 
mechanisms of EV-encapsulation will lead to a better understanding of cell–cell communications in 
health and disease.
Multicellular organisms are sustained by complex systems of intercellular communications. These include: 
cell-cell contacts, soluble factors (cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters) and recently discovered extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) that carry proteins, lipids, and micro RNAs1
. Cytokines are generally considered to function as 
classical soluble molecules. Here, however, we report on a system of bioactive cytokines that are released being 
encapsulated in extracellular vesicles.
We systematically analyzed the association between 33 cytokines and EVs in eight in vitro, ex vivo and 
in vivo biological systems (cultured T cells, cultured monocytes, explants of tonsillar, cervical, placental villous, 
and amnion tissues, amniotic fluid, and blood plasma of healthy volunteers). We found that a cytokine could be 
released predominantly either in soluble or in EV-associated form depending on the biological system. Moreover, 
upon stimulation, the pattern of encapsulation is changed depending on the stimulus, suggesting that the encap￾sulation of cytokines in EVs is not simply the property of a particular cytokine, but rather a tight biological pro￾cess. Importantly, EVs carrying cytokines are biologically active upon interacting with sensitive cells. The system 
of EV-encapsulated cytokines, which is not revealed by traditional assays, may play a significant role in health 
and disease.
Results
Free (soluble) and EV-associated cytokines. Culture medium from all cultured cells and explants as well 
as body fluids contained different amounts of EVs with mean sizes ranging from ~120–220 nm (Supplementary 
Table 1). We separated EVs from culture medium or body fluids using ExoQuick (for blood plasma) or ExoQuick 
TC (for culture supernatants and other body fluids). Cytokines were evaluated in both EVs and soluble frac￾tions using a Luminex platform. To evaluate cytokines encapsulated in EVs they were lysed with 1% Triton X 
and the resultant cytokine concentration (released both from the surface and from inside of EVs) was evalu￾ated. The amounts of encapsulated cytokines were calculated by subtracting the amounts of surface-attached 
cytokines, measured before adding the detergent, from that detected after EVs were lysed. Trypsin treatment of 
EVs was used to verify cytokines were on the surface or internal to EVs. Trypsinization resulted in the decrease 
of surface-bound cytokines, but the encapsulated ones remain largely intact: measurement of cytokines following 
trypsin treatment of tonsil-released EVs removed all but 26.3±9.1% of the surface-associated cytokines, while

inside 95.1±18.8% of the initial cytokine amount remained (n=5). Likewise, after trypsin treatment of placental 
villi-released EVs 15.5±11.4% of cytokines were left on the surface but 94.4±27.4% remained encapsulated 
compared to untreated EVs (n=2). To verify that free cytokines are not co-precipitated with EVs when using 
ExoQuick, we spiked fresh culture medium with recombinant cytokines of known quantities, isolated EVs with 
ExoQuick, and measured cytokines in the EV fraction. Only trace amounts of cytokines were found in EV frac￾tions (on average 0.24% of total cytokine). Additionally, we verified that cytokine association with the surface of 
EVs was not the result of binding of free cytokines to EVs when we spiked EVs from Jurkat cells with recombinant 
cytokines and again performed ExoQuick isolation and cytokine measurements on supernatant and EV fractions. 
Again we detected virtually no EV-associated cytokines (on average 0.76% of total cytokine).
Free vs. EV-associated cytokines in different biological systems. We evaluated the absolute 
(Supplementary Table 2) and relative (Fig. 1) amounts of each cytokine in the free (soluble) fraction and in the 
EV fraction for each system. Distribution of cytokines between free and EV-associated form was to a large extent 
a characteristic of a system, rather than of the cytokines being secreted by the same pathway in all systems. In 
one system, a cytokine was released mostly in a soluble form, whereas in another system the same cytokine was 
released in EV-associated form (Fig. 1a–h).
In general, placental villous tissue preferentially secreted cytokines in free (soluble) form: 26 cytokines were 
found more in soluble form (>50% of total) and only 1 cytokine, IL-33, was predominantly EV-associated 
(Fig. 1a). Over 90% of IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, GRO-α, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1β, MIP-3α and RANTES were secreted 
in solution by placental villous explants. In contrast, T cells and monocytes produced cytokines more in 
EV-associated form than in free form (Fig. 1g,h).
The other studied tissues and body fluids displayed a more heterogeneous mixture of free and EV associated 
cytokines (Fig. 1b–f).
Analysis of individual cytokines across the various systems revealed that 9 cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-16, 
IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MIP-3α, were more often found in free form. Eleven cytokines, IL-2, IL-4, 
IL-12p70, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, IL-33, IFN-γ, ITAC, TGF-β, and TNF-α, were found in greater levels in EVs than 
in the free form in most systems; 13 cytokines were relatively evenly split between two forms, being present more 
in EV in some systems and more in soluble form in other systems.
Amnion seems to release cytokines somewhat differently from other studied tissues. While in other tissues, 
IL-1α, IL-15, IL-16, IL-18, Calgranulin A, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and MIG were released predominantly in free form, 
for amnion tissues they were predominantly associated with EVs.
We found that the pattern of free and EV-associated cytokines released by explants during culture is rel￾atively stable. For example, tonsil explants continued to release cytokines in similar ratios at days 3, 6, and 9 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Cytokines associated with EVs: surface-bound vs. encapsulated. For each of the 33 cytokines in all 
eight systems we evaluated the cytokine fraction that was bound to the EV surface or EV-encapsulated (Fig. 2a–
h). In the system of placental villous explants 7 cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, GRO-α, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1β, 
were found predominantly (>50% of total) on the surface of EVs, whereas 20 cytokines were more often enclosed 
within EVs (Fig. 2a). In amnion explants 4 cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, GRO-α, and MIP-1β were predominantly asso￾ciated with the surface of EVs, whereas 21 cytokines were predominantly inside (Fig. 2b).
EV-associated cytokines released by tonsillar and cervical explants were distributed more evenly between the 
surface and interior of EVs (Fig. 2c,d). Among EV-associated cytokines released by cervical explants 13 were pre￾dominantly on the surface and 19 inside EVs (Fig. 2d). However, only 6 EV surface associated cytokines released 
by tonsillar and cervical tissues were the same for both systems: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, Calgranulin A, GRO-α and 
MCP-1.
Platelet poor plasma displayed the greatest fraction of EV-associated cytokines on the EV surface: 20 cytokines 
were more on the surface and 9 were more inside EVs (Fig. 2e), the former included IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, 
eotaxin, MIG, and TNFα that in other systems were encapsulated.
In contrast to plasma, in amniotic fluid out of all EV-associated cytokines only two, IL-17 and IFN-γ, were 
preferentially on the surface of EVs and only small fractions of another three, IL-1α, IL-22, and ITAC, were pres￾ent on the surface of EVs; whereas 27 other cytokines were almost exclusively inside EVs (Fig. 2f).
For T cells (Fig. 2g) and monocytes (Fig. 2h) fewer cytokines were on the surface of EVs, whereas for both 
types of cells EV-associated cytokines were predominantly inside the vesicles (25 and 20 respectively).
When comparing EV-associated cytokines released by different tissues/cells/body fluids, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, 
IL-12, IL-15, IL-16, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IL-33, Eotaxin, IP-10, ITAC, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-3α, TGF-β, and TNF-α
were preferentially encapsulated in EVs, whereas IL-8, IL-17, and GRO-α were found to be greater on the surface 
of EVs in the majority of systems (≥75%). Among the EV-associated cytokines, IL-6 release is uniquely selective, 
as it was mostly bound to the EV surface when released by tissues whereas it was mostly found inside EVs in body 
fluids or released by cultured immune cells. Also, the rates of EV encapsulation for some cytokines were unique 
for particular tissues: IL-13, IFNγ, and M-CSF were higher on the EV surface only in cervix, IL-16 and eotaxin 
were higher on the EV surface only in tonsil, IP-10 was higher on the EV surface only in villi, and MCP-1 was 
higher inside EVs only for amnion explants.
We investigated whether the EV-encapsulated cytokines were more stable than free cytokines. In experiments 
with tonsil and placental villous explants, we took samples of cell-free conditioned medium (containing both 
free and EV-associated cytokines) and incubated them for 2 days at 37 °C and then compared the concentration 
of cytokines with those measured immediately. The amount of free cytokines was significantly decreased in the 
conditioned medium by ~30% (70.2 ± 4.6% of the original amount remained (p=0.01, n=6)), while the amount 
of EV encapsulated cytokines was not different from the initial amount (88.8 ± 8.9% of original concentrations

(p=0.76, n=6)). Least stable in the free form were IL-1β, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IFNγ, IP-10, M-CSF, MIP-1α, 
MIP-1β, MIP-3α, and RANTES and TNF-α, while these and all other EV-encapsulated cytokines were protected.
In an attempt to address the nature of vesicles involved in cytokine encapsulation, we used three pharmaco￾logical inhibitors: ketotifen and manumycin A to inhibit exosomes2,3
, and imipramine to inhibit ectosomes4
. The 
strongest effect was obtained with manumycin A which decreased the amount of several EV-associated cytokines, 
namely IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, GRO-α, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MIP-3α, by 55–90%, consistent with their 
association with exosomes. Ketotifen and imipramine had less pronounced effects.

Activation changes EV-cytokine association. We investigated whether in the same system this pattern 
may be modulated. We compared the release of EVs by untreated and activated tonsillar explants. Activation with 
pokeweed mitogen resulted in drastic changes in the pattern of release of cytokines (Fig. 3a,b): For IL-7, IL-15, 
IL-33, Eotaxin, IFN-γ, IP-10, ITAC, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-1β, RANTES, and TNF-α there was a statistically signifi￾cant (p<0.05) shift toward a more soluble and less EV-associated pattern of cytokine secretion.

We investigated whether there was a change in cytokine secretion pattern of monocytes activated with two 
different stimuli, either LPS or Poly I:C (Fig. 4a,b,c). Activated monocytes release slightly more EVs (1.6±0.2 
compared to control (p=0.06, n=3)), however, the pattern of cytokine association with EVs was changed signifi￾cantly and was dependent on the stimuli. Monocytes activated by Poly I:C displayed shifts toward higher amounts 
of soluble cytokines especially for IL-21 and GM-CSF, and shifts toward more EV-associated cytokines for IP-10, 
MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and RANTES (p<0.05). Activation of monocytes with LPS resulted in a statistically 
significant (p<0.05) decrease in the fraction of EV-associated IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, GM-CSF, 
Gro-α, and TNF-α. A similar trend was observed for several other cytokines (Fig. 4). In contrast, MCP-1 shifted 
to more EV-associated form (p<0.05).
Not only the distribution of cytokines between EVs and free soluble form is changed upon monocyte acti￾vation, but the pattern of cytokine EV encapsulation versus surface association was modified as well, again in a 
stimulus-specific way (Fig. 4d,e,f). Monocytes activated by Poly I:C displayed shifts toward higher amounts of EV 
surface cytokines, which were significant (p<0.05) for IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α and RANTES, and shifts toward 
more EV-encapsulated cytokines for IL-1α and M-CSF (p<0.05). Activation of monocytes with LPS resulted 
in the general shifts in cytokine release toward more EV surface bound form, especially for IL-1β, IL-18, Gro-α, 
IP-10, M-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-1α (p<0.05).

Thus, in the same system, activation resulted in dramatic changes in the pattern of cytokines’ release and their 
encapsulation in EVs.
EV-encapsulated cytokines trigger responses in sensitive cells. With the discovery of so many 
cytokines associated with EVs, we investigated whether these cytokine-carrying EVs are biologically active. To 
answer this question, we incubated EV-associated cytokines with indicator cell lines TF-1 and MC/9 that are 
dependent on particular cytokines for their proliferation5
. First, we tested EVs isolated from plasma that carry 
IL-6 more on the surface of EVs than inside (66.7±1.9% on the surface and 8.3±1.4% inside EVs). We found 
that these EVs were active in eliciting responses from sensitive cells, and the response to the same EVs that were 
sonicated to release the internal cytokines was not significantly different from the response to the intact EVs 
(n=3, p=0.600) (Fig. 5a). Similar results (p=0.708, n=5) were obtained (Fig. 5b) when the sonication experi￾ments were performed with the entire medium rather than with isolated EVs, this time using supernatants from 
tonsil cultures which contain 69.3±3.9% of total IL-6 in free form and 30.7±3.9% EV-associated.
Similar experiments were conducted with intact and sonicated EVs from activated monocyte cultures which 
have 100±0% of IL-10 encapsulated in EVs and none on the EV surface. Responses to both intact and soni￾cated EVs were similar (n=3, p=0.094) (Fig. 5a). Likewise in experiments with intact and sonicated super￾natants from tonsil cultures, in which 4.6±1.9% of IL-10 was in free form and 95.4±3.9% was EV-associated 
(with 63.3±3.9% encapsulated), there was not a significant difference in response (p=0.676, n=4) (Fig. 5b). 
These experiments provided evidence that EVs that carry cytokines are biologically active and the encapsulated 
cytokines contribute to their activity.
Discussion
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a diverse family of lipidic particles pinched off plasma membranes or 
released from multivesicular bodies (exososmes) as reviewed in6
. EVs have been shown to alter characteristics 
of cells exposed to them7–9
 thus constituting a third system of cell-cell communications, complementing cell-cell 
contacts and communication by soluble factors, like cytokines. Although cytokines are generally thought to 
exert biologic influence as soluble molecules, several cytokines have been reported to be associated with extra￾cellular vesicles, for example, a membrane bound form of TNF-alpha from individuals with osteoarthritis10, 
chemokines associated with lipid rafts11, multiple cytokines inside human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem 
cell EVs12, or cytokines, such as the IL-1 family, which lack a signal peptide for secretion by the classical path￾way13. Additionally, it was shown that the amount of EV-associated cytokines was increased in HIV-infection14. 
Whether association with EVs reflects the chemical property of particular cytokines or whether association with 
EVs is a general regulated physiologic process remains to be understood.
Here we undertook a first comprehensive study of cytokine association with EVs in an attempt to answer the 
following questions: (i) how general is the phenomenon of cytokine association with EVs? (ii) are only particular 
cytokines associated with EVs? (iii) can a cytokine released in association with EVs in one system get released as 
a free (soluble) molecule in another? (iii) is the association of cytokines with EVs a regulated process that can be 
modulated? (iv) are cytokines encapsulated in EVs rather than merely attached to them? (v) can EV-encapsulated 
cytokines be delivered to sensitive cells and trigger a physiological response?
To answer these questions, we systematically analyzed the expression of 33 cytokines and their association 
with EVs in eight diverse in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo biological systems.
We demonstrated that being associated with EVs is not necessarily the property of a cytokine but rather is 
the regulated property of a system. In the eight different systems we studied, a given cytokine in one system can 
be released predominantly in a soluble form, while in another it can be predominantly EV-associated. Indeed, 
placental villous explants preferentially elaborated more cytokines in soluble form, including eight cytokines that 
were found over 90% in the free form. In contrast, T cells and monocytes released some of the same cytokines 
predominantly associated with EVs. The difference between placental villous explants and immune cells may be 
related to the high level of expression of cytokines by these tissue explants while T cell and monocyte suspensions 
that express much lower levels of cytokines may need to concentrate them in EVs rather than dissolving them in 
solution.

Among EV-associated cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-16, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IL-33, Eotaxin, 
IP-10, ITAC, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-3α, TGF-β, and TNF-α were preferentially encapsulated in EVs across all sys￾tems, in some instances all EV-associated cytokine was inside EVs (for example, IL-10 in cervix, T cell and mono￾cyte cultures, and IFN-γ in placental villous and amnion cultures as well as in amniotic fluid).
Thus, different biological systems differentially distribute the released cytokines between free and 
EV-associated forms. The pattern of the cytokine released is not a fixed property of the system but rather can be 
modulated, for example upon activation. In our experiments, the total number of EVs increased upon stimulation 
but only slightly probably because the total number of EVs may be the result of superimposition of EVs released 
by activated and non-activated cells. In general, the increased release of EVs was reported earlier and often was 
associated with immune activation15,16. Importantly, the relative fractions of free and EV-associated forms of 
cytokines are altered upon activation. Moreover, the two stimuli used here to activate monocytes changed the 
pattern of cytokine association with EVs in dramatically different patterns. In general, with some exceptions, 
relatively more cytokines are released in a free form upon stimulation and the association with EVs shifted from 
encapsulated to surface-attached forms. Whether these changes in the pattern of cytokine release occur at the 
single-cell level or some cells release free cytokines while others release EV-associated ones remains to be deter￾mined as all of the systems, including cultures of T cells or monocytes are comprised of populations that are 
heterogeneous in both activation status and phenotype. In any case these experiments show that the term “acti￾vation” may describe very diverse biological processes, in particular, in relation to cytokine encapsulation in EVs. 
The ability of one system to change the pattern of EV encapsulation of cytokines is another indication of the tight 
biological regulation of this process.
There could be multiple biologic meanings to loading EVs with cytokines. It was suggested that EV-entrapment 
is a mechanism to dispose of products when they are over-produced9
 simultaneously protecting the releasing 
cell from an autocrine effect. More probable is that EVs protect cytokines from environmental degradation. 
Indeed, EV-entrapped cytokines are protected from trypsin digestion. Also, in a more physiological environ￾ment, in the medium conditioned by tissue explants, free cytokines started to degrade in two days at 37 °C, while 
EV-encapsulated ones were largely protected. Also, EV-encapsulation may facilitate cytokine delivery and target￾ing to distant target cells. This targeting could be mediated by binding of EV-surface cytokines to cells that express 
specific cytokine receptors. Also, sialic-acid binding immunoglobulin lectins17, C-type lectins18, lactadherin19, 
membrane receptors like MHC I and II20, transferrin receptors21, and tetraspanins22 as well as viral proteins23 have 
been suggested as promoting targeting of EVs. In general, encapsulating cytokines in EVs may be a mechanism 
whereby the cytokine expressing cell could expand its sphere of influence to concentrate cytokines at the surface 
of other cells that might not otherwise be targeted by cytokines in solution.
Such a targeting would require that EV-associated cytokines are biologically active. Here we provide evidence 
for such activity using reporter cell lines that need particular cytokines to proliferate. We found that these cells 
responded to EVs containing IL-6 and IL-10 even when all of the cytokine is encapsulated. Our sonication exper￾iments indicated that the biological activity of the EV-encapsulated cytokines was the same whether we released 
the cytokines or provided them in EVs. In our model experiments EVs play a role of passive carriers releasing 
cytokines upon contacting cell surface. In vivo EVs may be delivered to selective target cells that respond to these 
EVs depending what cytokine receptors these cells express and what cytokines are associated with EVs. This com￾plex aspect of the in vivo situation is not reflected in the in vitro experiments with cell lines.
Since the cellular receptors for both IL-6 and IL-10 as well as for most cytokines, are on the cell surface24 mech￾anisms by which EV-encapsulated cytokines trigger biological effects should include the release of the entrapped 
cytokines when EVs interact with the cell surface. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated with other lipid 
vesicles which become leaky upon their contact with plasma membrane25,26 or in the process of fusion27. Similarly, 
a stimulus-dependent mechanism was suggested for cytokine liberation from cell-free eosinophil granules28.
In principle, the release of cytokines at the surface of a cell should be more efficient than depositing free mol￾ecules into the extracellular space since the release of the vesicle cargo in the close vicinity of target cells would 
create a high surface concentration even with a small quantity of released molecules. Therefore, while the biolog￾ical relevance of EV-associated cytokines whose concentration is comparable to those in a free form (e.g., IL-1α
(plasma, amnion, cervix), IL-10 (tonsil, cervix), IL-16 (amnion, T cells, monocytes), IL-17 (tonsil), eotaxin (villi, 
tonsil), Gro-α (tonsil), MCP (tonsil), MIP-3α (tonsil)) is obvious, we cannot exclude that even when the amount 
of cytokines associated with EVs is small (e.g IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β) they play an important role as 
they are delivered to the cell surface receptor rather than dissipated in a large volume.
In spite of a significant fraction of cytokines being encapsulated in EVs, these cytokines are not detected by 
standard target cell-free cytokine assays, such as ELISA or other multiplexed immunoassays since they are hidden 
from the cytokine-specific detection antibodies by the EV membrane. In our work, these cytokines were released 
by detergent or sonication. None of the conventional protocols for cytokine measurements include these proce￾dures. Therefore, the interpretations of the roles of these cytokines in health and disease based on these standard 
assays should be now reconsidered. For example, by traditional assays ITAC produced by LPS activated mono￾cytes would be 2-fold higher than Poly I:C activated (161 versus 81pg/ml), but when EV encapsulated cytokines 
are taken into account, LPS monocytes actually produce slightly less ITAC (238 versus 283pg/ml).
Our study has several limitations: We did not separate EVs into different fractions by size or by the presence of 
particular surface molecules to allow analysis of these fractions separately. Undoubtedly, patterns would emerge 
to show preferential packaging of particular cytokines into particular EVs. In an attempt to reveal these patterns, 
we used pharmacologic inhibitors of exosomes (ketotifen and manumycin A2,3
) and of ectosomes (imipramine4
). 
The strongest inhibition of several cytokines (55–90%) was obtained with manumycin A. However, it would be 
premature to conclude that these cytokines are associated with exosomes since inhibition by the other two inhib￾itors was less pronounced and affected different cytokines. Also, not all of these inhibitors are 100% specific2–4
, 
and moreover, in different cells different cytokines may be encapsulated in different vesicles. Another limitation

is that we do not know the stability of different types of vesicles that may affect their ability to retain enclosed 
cytokines. It was reported that exosomes are relatively stable29,30, however the stability of other vesicles has not 
been well studied.
Regardless of cytokine segregation in different EVs and their biogenesis, EVs seem to protect the encapsulated 
cytokines as shown by their stability, compared to free cytokines, when kept in conditioned medium for 2 days 
at 37 °C. This may be an important biological meaning of cytokine encapsulation while EV surface associated 
cytokines may contribute to addressing EVs to particular distant cells that express appropriate cytokine receptors.
In summary, our work is the first systematic study on cytokine association with EVs in diverse biological sys￾tems that showed that (i) cytokine encapsulation into EVs seems to be a general biological phenomenon observed 
in different in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo systems; (ii) although some cytokines are preferentially released in EVs 
and others in a free form, it seems that any given cytokine can be encapsulated into EVs; (iii) the same cytokine 
can be released in association with EVs in one biological system while in another it can be released as a free (sol￾uble) molecule; (iv) in the same biological system, the pattern of cytokine encapsulation into EVs is dramatically 
changed by activation; (v) EVs that encapsulate cytokines can deliver them to sensitive cells and trigger their 
physiological response.
The release of cytokines either in a free or EV-associated form might reflect an adaptation to specific phys￾iological needs, in particular whether these cytokines are needed to act near the secreting cell or at a distance. 
In support of this concept, tissue explants where cells were sustained in close proximity to the cells contained in 
their in vivo neighborhoods, tended to release more of their cytokines in a soluble form than were found in T cell 
or monocyte cell suspensions or in plasma where a greater proportion of cytokines were found associated with 
EVs. A system of EV-encapsulated cytokines as described above may represent an important system of cell-cell 
communication in health and disease and may serve as a new therapeutic target.
Methods
Sample preparation and storage. Placental tissues (the placenta and fetal membranes) from women who 
delivered at term without labor (n=10) were obtained at the Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, 
and the Perinatology Research Branch, an intramural program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute 
of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human 
Services (NICHD/NIH/DHHS) (Detroit, MI, USA). The collection and utilization of biological materials for 
research purposes were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of these institutions. All participating 
women provided written informed consent. Immediately after delivery, placental tissues were transported to the 
laboratory and three random samples from the placental villi were collected using a metal grid and the Random 
Position Generator DICE software (Perinatology Research Branch, Detroit, MI, USA). In addition, the amnion 
was gently separated from the chorion of the fetal membranes. Samples from the placental villi and amnion were 
placed in individual 50mL tubes containing DMEM and shipped overnight to NIH on cold packs. Upon receipt, 
villi were sectioned into strips of approximately 2mm×6mm, washed 3 times in PBS and cultured on Gelfoam 
adsorbable collagen sponges (Pharmacia and Upjohn) at the air-liquid interface, as has been described for other 
tissues31 in 0.1 μm filtered phenol red free DMEM (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 5% characterized, char￾coal stripped FBS (Hyclone), 50μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5μg/ml Amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher) at 37 °C, 5% 
CO2. Amniotic membrane was sectioned into 3×3 mm pieces, washed three times with PBS, and cultured in 
same medium. Equivalent masses were cultured in three wells of a six-well plate for each donor. Medium was col￾lected and changed at days 1, 4, and 7 after initiation. Medium was centrifuged at 400×g for 5minutes to remove 
cells and frozen at −80 °C.
Tonsillar tissue (n = 5) was obtained from routine tonsillectomies performed at the Children’s National 
Medical Center in Washington DC. Cervical tissue (n=6) from routine hysterectomy was received through 
the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA). All tissues were anonymous pathologi￾cal samples obtained according to an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Healthy tonsil tissue and 
mucosal areas of both ecto- and endo-cervix were dissected as previously described31. Briefly, tissue was dissected 
into 2 mm ×2 mm blocks and cultured on collagen sponges at the air liquid interface, with a minimum of 18 
blocks per condition, in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 15% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts), 100μM 
Modified Eagle’s medium (MEM)-nonessential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 50μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5μg/
ml Amphotericin B (all from Thermo Fisher). Medium was collected and changed at day 3, 6, and 9. Collected 
medium was centrifuged at 400×g for 5minutes to remove cells and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Activated 
tonsil cultures were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of pokeweed mitogen (PWM, Sigma) for 3 days and medium was 
collected as above.
Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was received from the Laboratory of Atherothrombosis at the Moscow University 
of Medicine and Dentistry under an IRB-approved protocol from 52 donors. Briefly, peripheral blood was col￾lected from healthy volunteers with risk factors of coronary artery disease (mild hypertension, obesity, dyslipi￾demia, smoking) into vacuum tubes with sodium citrate and centrifuged at 3,000×g for 15minutes for removal 
of cells and recovery of plasma. The plasma was again centrifuged at 3,000×g for 15minutes to remove platelets. 
Aliquots were frozen at −80 °C and later shipped to NIH on dry ice.
T cells (n=6) and monocytes (n=6) were harvested from whole blood obtained with written informed con￾sent at Case Western Reserve University/University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, OH under approval of 
the Institutional Review Board of University Hospitals. Following preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) by Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare) density sedimentation, T cells were enriched using magnetic 
bead negative selection (Miltenyi). Monocytes were enriched from whole blood using RosetteSep (STEMCELL) 
purification followed by CD61+platelet depletion (Miltenyi). T cell purity was 97%±1.17 and monocyte purity 
was 78%±2.26. Cells were cultured overnight in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal 
bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Culture supernatants were

collected, centrifuged at 2000×g for 15 minutes to remove cells and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C and later 
shipped to NIH on dry ice. For activated monocyte cultures, cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 
Sigma) at 100ng/ml or Poly I:C (Invivogen) at 25μg/ml for 24hours and medium was collected as above.
Amniotic fluid was collected by transabdominal, ultrasound-guided amniocentesis from women enrolled 
at Hutzel Women’s Hospital (Detroit, MI). All women provided written informed consent prior to the collec￾tion of biological samples. The utilization of samples for research purposes was approved by the Institutional 
Review Boards of Wayne State University and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(NICHD/NIH/DHHS). Amniotic fluid not required for clinical assessment was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 
4 °C at 1300×g for 10minutes shortly after the amniocentesis, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 
−80 °C. Fluid from 3 donors was pooled and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C and shipped to NIH on dry ice.
Preparation of EV fractions. All samples collected above were split into multiple fractions. One aliquot was 
kept untreated, another portion was treated with ExoQuick (SBI) for plasma or Exoquick TC for all other fluids 
according to manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, Exoquick was added to plasma without addition of thrombin at a 
ratio of 63ul of Exoquick to 250μl plasma and refrigerated for 30minutes at 4 °C. For all other samples, ExoQuick 
TC was added to supernatants at a ratio of 100 μl of ExoQuick TC to 500 μl of sample and refrigerated over￾night at 4 °C. ExoQuick/sample mixtures were centrifuged at 1500×g for 30minutes to pellet EVs. Supernatant 
was collected and saved for cytokine measurement of EV-free supernatant. The pellet was centrifuged again at 
1500×g for 5 minutes and all traces of fluid were removed resulting in an EV enriched preparation. The pellet 
was resuspended in 1X PBS in the original volume and saved for measurement of cytokines on intact and lysed 
EVs. In most instances, these fractions were stored at 4°C and run within 24hours. However, T cell and monocyte 
fractions collected at Case Western Reserve University were stored at −80 °C until shipment to NIH on dry ice. 
For experiments where EV fractions were added to cell cultures, EV contents were released by sonication for 3 x 
10minutes in an ultrasonic water bath32. Release of cytokines from EVs by sonication was compared to detergent 
lysis using EVs from tonsillar, villous, and amnion explants. Sonicated EVs released on average 98.9 ±6.4% of 
that released by detergent lysis. The only exception was Calgranulin A, the amount of which cannot be correctly 
measured in the presence of Triton X (see below).
EVs from tonsil and placental villous explants were isolated by ExoQuick procedures and treated with 0.25% 
trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher) for 20minutes at 37 °C to remove EV surface bound cytokines. Trypsin digestion 
was halted by addition of serum and EVs were isolated again by ExoQuick, followed by cytokine evaluation of 
intact and lysed EVs.
To verify that free cytokines are not co-precipitated with EVs when using ExoQuick, we spiked complete cul￾ture medium with recombinant cytokines of known quantities for all proteins measured. This spiked medium was 
treated with ExoQuick, and supernatant and EV fractions were collected and cytokines were measured in these 
fractions. We also verified that EVs from FBS did not contribute to our cytokine measurements. Next, the same 
recombinant protein spiked culture medium was incubated with EVs from Jurkat cells for one hour at 37 °C and 
treated with ExoQuick. Supernatant and EV fractions were analyzed for cytokine content and compared to levels 
of Jurkat EVs only (which contained low levels of only a few cytokines).
LPS activated monocytes were treated with 1 μM and 10 μM ketotifen, manumycin A, imipramine (Sigma). 
Medium samples were collected after 24hours and analyzed for EV-associated cytokines.
NanoSight measurement of EV. Aliquots of samples (not treated with ExoQuick) were diluted and char￾acterized with Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software using a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern), which uses light 
scattering and Brownian motion to obtain particle size distributions and concentrations. Briefly, samples were 
diluted 1:10 or 1:100 in particle-free PBS and placed in the analyzer. Three representative samples for each sys￾tem were analyzed by 2 video captures of 60 seconds each to generate averaged concentrations of EV/ml±SEM, 
mean±SEM particle size (nm), mode (most commonly found particle size)±SEM of particle size (nm), and D90 
(the size above which 90% of particles are contained)±SEM (nm). Samples from tissue explants were evaluated 
on day 3 (accumulation of EVs from day 1–3 of culture) for tonsillar and cervical explants, and day 4 (accumu￾lation of EVs from day 2–4 of culture) for villi and amnion explants. Samples from T cells and monocytes were 
evaluated at day 1 of culture.
Cytokine measurement. We previously developed an in-house multiplexed bead-based assay for meas￾urement of the following 33 cytokines: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, 
IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IL-33, Calgranulin A (S100A8), Eotaxin (CCL11), granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth-regulated alpha (GRO-α or CXCL1), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), 
interferon-γ-induced protein (IP-10 or CXCL10), interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (ITAC 
or CXCL11), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 
or CCL2), monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG or CXCL9), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α
or CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), MIP-3α (CCL20), regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted 
(RANTES or CCL5), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as described 
previously with slight modifications33,34. All antibody pairs and cytokine standards were purchased from R&D 
Systems except those for IL-4 (Biolegend) and IL-21 (eBioscience). Magnetic beads (Luminex) with 33 distinct 
spectral signatures (regions) were coupled to cytokine specific capture antibodies according to manufacturer’s 
recommendations and stored at 4 °C. All cytokine pairs were verified to be free of cross reactivity. Standards 
and samples were diluted in assay buffer (1X PBS with 20mM Tris-HCl, 1% each normal mouse and goat serum 
(Gemini Bioproducts) and 0.05% Tween 20) and combined with bead mixtures and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 
Intact EV samples and lysed EV samples to which Triton X was added at final concentration of 1% were run in 
separate wells. Plates were washed 3 times and incubated with mixtures of polyclonal biotinylated anti-cytokine

antibodies (R&D Systems) in assay buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times and 
incubated for 25 minutes with 16 μg/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen) in PBS. Plates were washed 3 
times and beads were resuspended in PBS. Plates were read on a Luminex 200 analyzer with acquisition of a 
minimum of 100 beads for each region and analyzed using Bioplex Manager software (BioRad). Cytokine con￾centrations were determined using 5P regression algorithms. Concentrations of analytes in EV free supernatants 
were adjusted for dilution by ExoQuick reagent. For tissue explants, the sum of cytokines over the entire culture 
period (7–9 days) was calculated, T cells and monocyte cytokines were measured after 1day in culture, and body 
fluids were measured directly ex vivo.
We evaluated the effect of detergent treatment on “free” cytokines by measuring cytokines in the supernatant 
fractions after Exoquick treatment (containing no EVs) with and without Triton X. We found that the difference 
between measuring free cytokines with or without detergent was statistically not different. The only exception 
was Calgranulin A, for which Triton X interfered with the assay by decreasing the apparent measurement to 
43.4±4.4% that of control without detergent (n=12, p=0.01).
Cytokine bioassay. Cultured cell line-based cytokine driven proliferation assays were used to test bioactivity 
of cytokines in the EV fractions. TF-1 (ATCC) is a human erythroleukemic cell line responsive to a number of 
human cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13, as well as erythropoietin, leukemia inhib￾itory factor, nerve growth factor, and stem cell factor. This cell line was cultured in RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2mM 
L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2 ng/ml GM-CSF. We used proliferation of this cell line to measure activity 
of IL-6. MC/9 (ATCC) is a mouse mast cell line used to measure activity of IL-10. MC/9 is cultured in DMEM 
high glucose supplemented with 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2mM L-glutamine, 50μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% 
Rat T-STIM (Becton Dickenson), and 10% FBS. Cells were counted, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at a 
concentration of 2×105
 cells/ml in culture medium without exogenous cytokine or T-STIM. Briefly, 50 μl of cells 
per well were added to 96 well flat bottom plates and then treated with intact or sonicated supernatants or EV 
fractions. Since lysed fractions are not compatible with cell culture we instead sonicated supernatant or EV frac￾tions for 30minutes and verified that this released EV contents (IL-6 released 83.7±8.2% and IL-10 92.9±6.0% 
that released by detergent lysis). These fractions were added at 50μl per well, in addition to positive control wells 
of cells with complete growth medium and negative control wells of cells with medium not containing growth 
factors. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Metabolic activity was measured by an MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. MTT (Sigma) was prepared at 5mg/ml 
in PBS and sterile filtered. 5 μl of MTT was added to each well and plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37 °C. 
Lysis buffer of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/50% dimethyl formamide (DMF)(Sigma) was added at 50μl 
per well and plates were incubated for 1hour and absorbance was measured at 570nm on Tecan Sapphire 2 using 
Magellan 5.0 software. Plates were read a second time after overnight incubation, to ensure all formazan crystals 
were completely dissolved. Results were expressed as % of positive control (cells in complete growth medium).
Statistical Analysis. We conducted statistical analysis using JMP10 (SAS Institute). Results are represented 
as means±standard error of the mean (SEM). The statistical differences between various experimental groups 
were evaluated with paired Student’s t test. All hypothesis tests were two-tailed and a p value of ≤0.05 defined 
statistical significance.
