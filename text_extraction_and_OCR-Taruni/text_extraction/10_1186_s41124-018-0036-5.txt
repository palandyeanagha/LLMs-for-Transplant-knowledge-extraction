Abstract
Background: Universal access to the hepatitis C direct acting antiviral (DAAs) regimens presents a unique
opportunity to eliminate hepatitis C in Australia. Large numbers of Australians have already been cured using these
treatments, however, the numbers presenting for treatment have begun to plateau. This study explored how
people experienced and understood being cured of hepatitis C, with the aim of informing interventions to increase
uptake of DAA treatment among people with hepatitis C.
Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of people with hepatitis
C taking DAAs accessing both hospital and community clinics. Interviews were conducted 12 weeks after treatment
completion. Participants were asked to reflect on their experience of living with hepatitis C, their reasons for
seeking treatment, and their experience of, DAA treatments. Participants were also asked to reflect on the meaning
of being cured, and how they shared this experience with their peers. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and key
themes were identified using inductive thematic analysis.
Results: Twenty participants were interviewed. While participants described a range of physical health benefits of
achieving a hepatitis C cure it was an improved sense of psychological wellbeing that had the most significant
impact on participants’ lives. The majority described their relief about no longer living with the burden of an
uncertain future due to anxiety about developing liver disease or cancer, as well as fear of infecting others.
Participants who had a past history of injecting drug use, described being cured as a way to break the connection
with their past. Participants who were current injectors raised concerns about re-infection.
Conclusion: Feeling “normal” and not infectious allows people to live with reduced psychological distress, in
addition to the physical benefits of no longer being at risk of developing serious liver disease. Future engagement
strategies targeting people who are not accessing hepatitis health care need to promote the lived experience of
being cured and the substantial psychological, and physical health benefits, offered by achieving a cure.
Interventions aimed at people who are currently injecting also need to highlight the availability of re-treatment in
conjunction with primary prevention strategies.

Background
The universal, government funded access to direct acting
antiviral (DAA) treatments for hepatitis C in Australia
presents a unique opportunity to eliminate hepatitis C.
The Australian Government [1], in line with the World
Health Organization (WHO) [2], has set the ambitious
target of eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat
by 2030. During the first 15 months of access, an
estimated 43,360 people initiated DAA treatment in
Australia [3]. However, an estimated 200,000 Australians
remain infected with hepatitis C and data suggests the
number of people presenting for treatment in Australia
plateaued in 2017 [3]. The decline in number of people
accessing DAA treatment compared to 2016 reflects the
clearing the of the so called “treatment warehouse” where
patients were regularly engaging with clinical services
while waiting for the DAAs, and highlights the importance
of ongoing vigilance regarding testing and linkage to care.
The reason for the plateau in number of people presenting
for treatment is thought to be multifactorial: lack of know￾ledge about hepatitis C, [4, 5] the asymptomatic nature of
the disease and the negative perceptions of previous
interferon-based treatment mean that many people with
hepatitis C do not prioritise the treatment [6]. Addition￾ally, the social marginalisation related to current or
past injecting drug use and the stigma and discrimin￾ation associated with injecting drug use, have been
shown to act as significant barriers to accessing hepa￾titis C testing and treatment [7, 8].
Hepatitis C infection has been associated with multiple
extrahepatic manifestations such as depression and
diabetes [9], which can have a profound impact on
quality of life [10, 11]. The clinical impact of achiev￾ing a sustained virological response (SVR) measured
at 12 weeks after treatment completion, and now
referred to as hepatitis C cure, [12] has been widely
reported to reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity
and mortality, [13, 14] and the risk of developing ex￾trahepatic manifestations, [15–17] and is associated
with improved quality of life [18]. From the patients’
perspective cure of hepatitis C is associated with im￾proved energy levels, reduced uncertainty about the
future, a more positive outlook on life, and improved
personal relationships [19, 20].
While the public health approach to hepatitis C treat￾ment focuses on population level elimination, [12]
understanding the impact of cure for individuals and
affected communities and communicating these experi￾ences to people with hepatitis C and service providers is
central in persuading others to access treatment services.
This qualitative study explores experiences of being
cured of hepatitis C; the findings contribute new
knowledge to inform interventions to promote access to
hepatitis C treatment.
Methods
Recruitment
Ethics approval for this study was granted by the St
Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, Low and Negligible Risk
Human Research and Ethics Committee (LRR-209/15).
Participants were recruited through one Melbourne
metropolitan tertiary hospital-based liver clinic and three
affiliated community-based clinics between October 2016
and April 2017. The three community-based clinics were
located in inner and northern metropolitan Melbourne
and staffed by medical specialists and nurses employed by
the tertiary hospital to offer an outreach specialist service
including access to hepatitis C testing, liver diseases as￾sessment and DAA treatment. Nursing staff from each
clinic invited consecutive patients who had achieved an
SVR, 12 weeks after treatment completion to contact the
researcher (JR), who provided a participant information
statement and consent form. If the individual decided to
proceed, written informed consent was obtained prior to
the interview. Interviews were conducted by author JE
and were conducted either face to face at the hospital
liver clinic or on the phone. Interviews lasted
between 20 and 45 min. Participants were offered a
$AUD30 gift voucher after the interview.
Data collection
Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore
the experiences of people who achieved an SVR after
taking DAA treatment. Participants were asked to:
 Identify the barriers and enablers to treatment
success from their perspective
 Explore the meaning of ‘cure’
 Describe the ways they shared knowledge and
experiences of treatment within their peer networks
 Describe adherence strategies they used while taking
the DAAs.
Analysis
Interviews were transcribed verbatim and imported and
coded in NVivo Pro, a qualitative data analysis computer
software package. A thematic analysis was undertaken
by authors JR and RT to identify text relating to the key
themes associated with the research questions and
informed the development of a coding framework. New
themes identified after repeated close reading of the
transcripts were added to the coding framework. Memos
were used to record ideas about connections between
the themes and to the overarching concept of cure.
Results
Participants
Twenty participants were interviewed during the study,
with their characteristics presented in Table 1. Equal

numbers of men (n = 10) and women (n = 10) were inter￾viewed. Twelve participants attended the tertiary hos￾pital liver clinic, with the remaining eight participants
attending one of three community-based clinics. Partici￾pants reported being diagnosed with hepatitis C between
two to twenty-seven years ago. Two participants reported
being diagnosed with cirrhosis and a further two
participants reported they had test results that indi￾cated severe liver disease. Seven participants had
completed interferon-based therapy prior to this
course of the DAAs. For the remaining 13 partici￾pants, this course of the DAAs was their first hepa￾titis C treatment experience.
The meaning of achieving a ‘hepatitis C cure’
Psychological impact
Participants discussed their understanding of being
cured in several ways. The most frequently identified
outcome of achieving a ‘cure’ was being relieved of the
psychological burden of living with hepatitis C, and this
outcome was often prioritised over that of physical
symptoms. Most participants reported experiencing few
symptoms prior to commencing treatment, and as such,
were often unaware of any physical burden of living with
hepatitis C:
It hasn’t changed my life that much because I never
really had any symptoms… The biggest change is
just…emotionally…you go from being someone with a
chronic disease that has the potential to cut your life
short to being free (Participant 18, female).
Three participants were excited about not having to
worry about their health and instead being able to plan
for their future and old age, with a more positive
outlook:
It’s like a real weight has just been lifted from you.
I probably believed that one day it would get me
because you just think oh, liver cancer, it’s such an
insidious nasty thing. If you get that, you’re buggered
(Participant 5, female).
Reduced uncertainty and fear
While some participants associated being cured with less
uncertainty and fear about the future, others highlighted
that being cured allowed them to clarify the physical ef￾fects of hepatitis C infection, which reduced their uncer￾tainty related to their general health. Four participants
noted that while they lived with hepatitis C, they were
never sure whether to attribute illness or fatigue to their
hepatitis C infection or another illness, or ageing. Since
being cured, participants reported being more certain
about the cause of other physical conditions or illnesses:
It’s hard to tell what it’s actually doing to you and
whether the fatigue or ill health is related to it because
it was never very clear what [hepatitis C] did to you
(Participant 7, male).
Another participant described no longer worrying
about whether symptoms were underlying signs of a
more serious health condition:
The fact that that’s not there anymore, like if I get sick
or I’m ill means all I’ve got is that. I’ve just got the ‘flu
... It’s not that it’s my liver’s fricking packing up on me
or something (Participant 5, female).
“Feeling normal”
The experience of the cure also related to participants
reporting they no longer felt infectious, particularly in
the context of their family or people they lived with.
This was often expressed in a marked shift in how they
thought about themselves. For many the implied
meaning of feeling “normal” was not being “dirty” or
“infectious”:

I feel normal again … I don’t feel different to everyone
else (Participant 6, male).
For some, no longer being infectious meant they
could change their behaviour and personal interac￾tions because they did not have to worry about
transmission:
At my house, with toothbrushes and razors and
stuff, it’s been something that I’ve had to be really,
really vigilant with, with children in the house and
with my partner … it’s really nice to know that I
don’t have that in me anymore, and there aren’t
those risks there of passing it on to anyone else
(Participant 6, male).
However, one participant continued long term habits in
avoiding physical contact to prevent possible transmission:
I’ve got issues where I can’t kiss anyone or I won’t
let anyone take a drag of my cigarette…I still
can’t, because it’s been years like I’ve been
doing that, so I still can’t stop doing that
(Participant 2, female).
One participant discussed the impact of cure on their
interactions with health providers such as dentists and
pathology collectors:
I love not being infectious…That for me has probably
been the biggest thing – not having to feel guilty every
time I had a blood test done that I might infect
somebody, going to the dentist is nowhere near as
stressful (Participant 17, female).
Breaking a connection to the past
Several participants who contracted hepatitis C
through sharing injecting equipment, and who no
longer injected, described a sense of guilt and shame
about their past injecting; feelings which persisted
years after they had stopped injecting. These partici￾pants explained that hepatitis C was an ongoing
marker of their injecting history and that being cured
broke that connection:
It’s like the last mark … is now gone. All the rest is
just memories that I don’t have to think about
(Participant 6, male).
Participants reflected on the ways being cured shifted
their sense of self self-perception, and some felt that no
longer having the disease would enable a break with the
past:
It does make me feel more normal in a community
sense … that I don’t have appointments or doctors are
going to find out or my daughter’s friends are going to
find out. That’s very liberating (Participant 2, female).
Others expected they would continue to experience
guilt in relation to their past drug use:
I still feel guilty about it…about having used drugs
when I was younger, about having contracted the
hepatitis C… It’s just a bit of a mental scar that I
suppose I’m going to carry for a long time
(Participant 16, male).
Physical impact
While many participants had not felt they had physical
symptoms before commencing treatment, some de￾scribed experiencing improved physical health as a result
of being cured. Three participants explicitly attributed
their improved physical health to being cured of hepa￾titis C, while others were uncertain whether their per￾ception that their health had improved was directly
related to hepatitis C or a result of the psychological
benefits that flowed from no longer living with the virus:
I don’t know how much of that is psychological. I don’t
think it’s all psychological. I’m sure there is a physical
element … I have more energy, I am sleeping better,
just a whole range of things (Participant 16, male).
One participant with hepatitis C-related liver damage
noted that even after being cured, she needed to
undergo regular monitoring for liver disease. However,
her concern about one day dying of liver disease was
reduced:
Because I am cirrhotic I still have to have regular
FibroScans and liver function tests. In some ways those
things haven’t changed. I think it is just more that my
outlook has changed (Participant 17, female).
For many participants the physical effects of living
with hepatitis C only became apparent post cure. For
those participants with significant liver damage, the on￾going need to monitor the liver for complications was a
reminder of the physical damage inflicted by living with
the virus for a long time.
Adherence strategies
In addition to exploring the impact and meaning
ascribed by participants to achieving a cure, the
interviews explored the experiences of taking the
DAAs. Overall, participants reported that adherence
Richmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 4 of 9

to the DAAs was easy and unproblematic. One reason
cited for the ease of adherence was a strong desire to
be hepatitis C free and a belief that inconsistent
adherence to the treatment would affect their chance
of being cured.
I just made sure I did what the doctors recommended
to beat this bloody thing (Participant 3, female).
The most common adherence strategy described by
participants was taking the tablet(s) at the same time
every day, and either by establishing a new routine or fit￾ting the DAAs into an established routine. Participants
who were already taking daily medication commonly
discussed incorporating the DAAs into this routine and
taking the DAAs at the same time as the other medica￾tion, most often in the morning:
In the morning with my contraceptive pill. As soon as I
wake up … that’s usually what I do, the pill, brush my
teeth, shower (Participant 15, female).
Those who were not already taking medication
discussed incorporating the DAAs into other daily
routines:
It was straightforward for me and I think that’s
why it was good to do them at night. I had them
by the bed and I’d have a drink of water and I’d
plug my phone in … I built it into that kind of a
routine (Participant 5, female).
One participant, taking up to five DAA tablets a day,
used a dosette box to support adherence while another
used a calendar, and others mentioned checking each
dose off on a chart that had come with the DAA pack￾aging. Another who was not accustomed to taking daily
medication recalled finding it difficult to remember to
take the DAAs, and set a daily mobile phone alarm as a
reminder.
Fourteen participants reported forgetting to take one
or two doses, which in some cases made them feel
extremely anxious as they were concerned it would
influence the efficacy of the treatment. This episode
motivated those participants to take the tablets as soon
as they remembered:
A couple of days I thought, you know, at lunchtime,
oh, strewth, I haven’t taken my pills. (Laughs)… no, no,
no, no. And I mean, it was so important. I mean, my
future sort of rode on it (Participant 18, female).
Other participants checked with their doctors regard￾ing the recommended strategy for missed doses:
I told the doctor and he said that’d be fine as long as I
made sure that I kept everything, you know, spot on
from then on, and I did (Participant 6, male).
Overall, participants reported ease with adhering to
the DAA regimen and developed individual strategies to
support their daily administration.
Barriers and enablers to taking DAA treatment
The challenges associated with using DAA regimens
related to individual circumstances, such as pharma￾ceutical management of existing medical conditions
and lack of awareness among health professionals of
the DAAs. One participant discussed the need to
cease taking existing medication to manage a mental
health condition and this required closer monitoring
while she was on the course of DAAs. Another par￾ticipant replaced one medication with another as her
liver enzymes had risen.
In terms of side effects, one participant reported
experiencing high blood pressure from taking the DAAs,
which caused side effects throughout the duration of the
treatment:
I still didn’t have an easy time because my specialist
told me it would lower my blood pressure and it
didn’t. It made my blood pressure go higher … it
wasn’t fun for me at all (Participant 14, female).
Inexperience and lack of confidence amongst health
professionals regarding DAAs and potential drug inter￾actions was highlighted by several participants as a
potential barrier to access. One participant identified
that their doctor was unwilling to prescribe the DAAs
given their lack of knowledge:
When I’d decided and rocked up to my appointment
to ask her about it and she told me that she wasn’t
prepared to prescribe because she hadn’t got her head
around it, that was just a huge blow…if people aren’t
even prepared to prescribe it, well, why are we doing
this? (Participant 19, female).
Another participant was disappointed about their
doctor’s lack of understanding about potential drug
interactions:
[A Nurse] …told me about this website from … a
hospital that listed all the interactions of the hepatitis
C drugs with existing drugs. I’d gone right through that
and checked what I was taking against all that and
that was how I realised that I shouldn’t actually be
taking [the medication]. So I spoke to my GP about it
and we sorted that out … It was really only the fact
Richmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 5 of 9

that [the nurse] was so on the ball that we ended up
getting it sorted out (Participant 16, male).
However, most participants reported being supported
by health professionals during treatment. One partici￾pant, who was currently injecting drugs discussed
difficulties in treatment adherence as their life was “a
bit chaotic”, and described how the health profes￾sionals in a community-based service supported
adherence.
Another participant discussed that the anticipation of
side effects was a barrier to their commencing treat￾ment; the fear of potential side effects was worse than
the experience.
I approached it with a degree of trepidation but as it
turned out I just simply got stuck into it and had very
minimal side-effects (Participant 5, female).
Most participants were treated through specialist
services either in a tertiary hospital or in an outreach
clinic in the community; only three participants were
prescribed their DAA course by a General Practitioner
(GP). As interviews were conducted at the beginning of
the implementation phase of the DAAs in Australia
when few GPs were involved in prescribing DAAs and
awareness raising activities had not officially com￾menced, the experiences of participants with GPs may
have been be less than ideal.
Sharing knowledge with peers
All participants reflected on their positive experiences of
the treatment and being cured by recommending that
people with hepatitis C seek advice from their doctor
about taking DAAs:
I have told a few people and other people have asked
me … I recommend it (Participant 1, female).
I’m reasonably medically aware I suppose and
cautious, but with that background I would urge
anybody with hep C to very much be confident
about getting onto this drug to cure themselves
(Participant 12, male).
While all participants emphasised the positive aspects
of being cured, some also thought that it was important
to inform prospective patients of the potential side
effects:
The only thing was that I really would be reluctant to
tell people that these medications are side-effect free …
there’s a 2% chance that anyone would have the
reaction I did (Participant 17, female).
One participant said that although they would like to
share their experiences of being cured with peers and the
broader community, they remained cautious about telling
people about their experience of living with hepatitis C
given the stigma associated with contracting the virus
through injecting drugs:
One part of me wants to sort of yell it at the top of my
voice and say, look, this is an amazing, miraculous
cure out there. Please, anyone that’s got hep C, go and
get involved with it. But then the other part of me, sort
of I suppose the conservative – but … I still feel guilty
about it (Participant 16, male).
There was a strong sense that the DAAs needed to be
distinguished from interferon-based treatments with
participants emphasising the need to advertise that DAAs
were more effective and had fewer side effects than
interferon-based treatment, and were simple to take:
I’d tell them, no matter what your experience
with past drugs … this is totally different
(Participant 18, female).
The two participants who identified as current inject￾ing drug users were positive about their treatment
experience and said they would encourage peers to seek
treatment. One participant shared her experiences
formally as a peer educator:
I’d already started working as a peer educator, so
part of that was an obligation to other users and
needing to know what I was trying to tell people
and encourage people to do... if I’m going to tell
another user to do something I want to at least
have experienced it, so I know what the hell I’m
telling them (Participant 19, female).
While the current injectors were positive about
taking the DAAs, they identified potential barriers fa￾cing other people who inject, including the potential
for re-infection. One participant was concerned that
re-infection would become a new source of stigma:
I think that there’s also something to be said about the
stigma and the guilt that goes along with re-infection.
That’s a whole new monster that we’re going to have to
deal with soon (Participant 19, female).
This same participant also proposed that some
current injectors would continue to hold off on treat￾ment because they conceptualised treatment as some￾thing to embark upon after they finished injecting
drugs:
Richmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 6 of 9

I am finding that just even talking to the community
on the street, it’s just like - yeah, big deal, there’s a
treatment, but I’m not done with the life at the
moment here, you know. And they do see it as
something to happen when they’ve done with their
using life (Participant 19, female).
Discussion
There is no disputing the revolutionary impact the
DAAs have had on the clinical management of hepatitis
C. While most participants involved in the current study
had not experienced symptoms related to hepatitis C,
they described feeling lucky to have escaped the
infection relatively unscathed. Most significant was the
psychological impact of being cured, highlighting the
serious impact of hepatitis C and drug use
related-stigma on the lived experience of people with
hepatitis C and the uncertainty related to the physical
impact of living with the infection.
Participants no longer felt infectious or a threat to
their families and friends in terms of onward transmis￾sion, and for several participants, the benefit of breaking
a link to previous drug use was transformative. This
experience is echoed by the findings of Harris (2017)
who describes hepatitis C treatment as promising social
reconnection, social redemption from the drug using
past and a return to ‘normality’ [21]. While most partici￾pants were not currently injecting drugs, the label of
“drug user” inferred by a diagnosis of hepatitis C was an
important motivator to access treatment. Also, the relief
of no longer needing to worry about the risk of illness or
death because of an infection contracted during their
youth was immensely important.
Participants were passionate advocates for sharing the
benefits of being cured with people in their network and
complete strangers. The unexpected result of feeling
“normal” because they were no longer infectious was
highlighted as an important message to communicate to
people not currently engaged in hepatitis C health care.
The psychological relief, in addition to the physical ben￾efits of no longer being at risk of developing serious liver
disease and cancer were perceived as positive outcomes
of being cured. However, while participants were keen to
share their cure stories with peers and the communities,
they also articulated a continuing fear of “outing” them￾selves as someone who contracted a disease most preva￾lent among people who inject drugs. As discussed, this
label can have severe social ramifications such as alien￾ation and discrimination that result in poor access to
health services, [22, 23] and the ongoing fear of stigma
created a barrier to sharing the good news.
In Australia, the number of people initiating DAAs
has plateaued from extremely high volumes in 2016
to a lower but constant number during 2017.
Although evidence suggests that Australia has a high
diagnosis rate of approximately 80%, [24] the quality
and understanding of the meaning of the diagnosis is
unknown. Increasing testing rates and subsequent en￾gagement in treatment is essential if hepatitis C elim￾ination is to be achieved. Hence it is vital to engage
and re-engage people with, or at risk of hepatitis C,
many who were given outdated information decades
ago or were frightened by the side effects associated
with interferon-based therapy. Re-engaging people
with or at risk of hepatitis C requires a committed
health system response and knowledgeable and en￾gaged health professionals, as well as directly promot￾ing the experience of people with recent treatment
experience. A first step could be a systematic testing
campaign where the benefits of cure negate the po￾tential fear of stigma and discrimination associated
with hepatitis C. Integrating and normalising hepatitis
C treatment and care in the primary care setting with
systematic programs that offer testing to all patients
attending the practice regardless of risk factors is one
possible strategy [25].
In the current study, 13 participants were naïve to pre￾vious hepatitis C treatment, including interferon-based
regimens. These participants were among the first group
treated in Australia and sought DAA treatment quickly;
two participants reported being forced to commence the
DAAs early due to the imminent risk of illness resulting
from severe liver disease. The desire to physically re￾move the virus and reduce their risk of morbidity and
mortality was the predominant motivator to accessing
the DAAs, however, the psychological impact of being
cured was significant.
One barrier to accessing DAAs noted by several
participants was the lack of knowledge and awareness
among health professionals about hepatitis C and the
DAAs. Twelve participants accessed DAAs through a
tertiary hospital clinic because they had all been attend￾ing the clinic for several years for ongoing surveillance
and monitoring of their liver health. Whereas the eight
participants recruited from a community-based clinic
had sought out the clinics for the purpose of accessing
DAAs, although technically they should have been able
to access them through any GP. It is worth noting that
this study was conducted during the early DAA imple￾mentation phase in Australia; while the initial proportion
of DAA prescriptions initiated by primary care practi￾tioners was low (8%), it steadily increased over time to
39% in June 2017 [3]. Therefore, while participants were
all able to find health services or practitioners that could
facilitate access to the DAAs, this was not a universally
straightforward at the time the interviews were conducted.
Relying on individuals’ personal motivation to access
Richmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 7 of 9

DAAs is not a sustainable response. There are many
workforce development projects underway in Australia,
that aim to build the capacity of primary care practitioners
and ensure that people with hepatitis C have multiple
access points to DAA treatment; these programs need to
be sustained overtime.
Future promotion of the next wave of DAA candidates
in Australia should draw on the firsthand experiences of
people who have been through the DAA treatment and
have achieved cure, including people who currently in￾ject drugs. Roger’s ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ theory seeks
to explain how, why, and at what rate new innovations
(ideas, technology and/or products) gain momentum
and diffuse or spread through a specific population.
This theory suggests that when an innovation, in this
case, DAAs, are promoted by respected individuals
within a social network, it creates a desire to adopt
the innovation [26]. This perspective is supported by
research that shows that people with hepatitis C have
played an important role in engaging people who inject
drugs with hepatitis C in treatment services [27–30].
The limitations of this study should be acknowledged
when interpreting the data; the small sample size and in￾herent limitations regarding the generalisability of quali￾tative data at a population level and the timing of
recruitment during the early stages of the DAA imple￾mentation in Australia could all affect the relevance of
this data to the current cohort of people seeking DAA
treatment. Study participants most likely represent early
adopters of the DAAs, who sought out the treatment be￾cause they were well informed and motivated, compared
to people currently accessing treatment who have pre￾ferred to wait and gather evidence of the DAA’s success.
The environment, in terms of the public’s and health
workforce’s awareness has most likely improved over time,
making access to treatment less reliant on highly moti￾vated individuals. The focus of this study was on partici￾pants’ experiences of being cured, therefore, demographic
information about participants’ age, mode of infection and
liver disease staging were not systematically collected. The
authors acknowledge that these factors may influence peo￾ple’s experience of being cured of hepatitis C.
Most participants in this study found DAAs easy to
take with generally mild and manageable side-effects.
Nonetheless they indicated it was important to acknow￾ledge the potential for DAA side effects, as this would
enable people to plan and establish contingency plans
for the treatment course and support adherence. Overall,
adherence to the DAAs was not an issue of concern, in
this study, participants described how they identified
their own memory hooks and existing routines to sup￾port the daily administration of the DAAs [31]. However,
these participants were particularly motivated to achieve
a cure. In the future, more planning and support may be
needed to support adherence for people who are more
sceptical about the DAAs and of their own need to
achieve a cure.
The perspectives of participants who currently inject
drugs illustrates that the availability and effectiveness of
DAAs are not the only factors that influence their
decision to start treatment, which is supported by
Goutzamanis and colleagues (2016) [32]. Health promo￾tion messages need to shift the perceptions of current
injectors around treatment and re-treatment to ensure
they understand that DAAs are universally available and
people who currently inject are a priority population for
treatment access. In providing hepatitis C treatment and
care, clinicians, pharmacists and other service providers
should highlight the individual health benefits of
re-treatment and the population level benefits of stop￾ping onward transmission. The issue of re-infection also
demonstrates the importance of promoting ongoing
hepatitis C testing for current injectors and for continu￾ing investment in harm reduction programs including
needle and syringe programs.
Conclusion
Future engagement strategies targeting people with
hepatitis C who are not currently accessing DAA treat￾ment need to use the lived experience of being cured,
particularly the significant psychological impact such as
relief about no longer being a transmission risk for
family members. Promoting this alongside the health
benefits offered by the hepatitis C cure, and having a
reduced risk of developing liver disease and liver cancer
are crucial in supporting elimination efforts.
