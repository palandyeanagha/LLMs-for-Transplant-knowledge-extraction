Abstract
Systematic review of the use of bone turnover markers
for monitoring the response to osteoporosis treatment:
the secondary prevention of fractures, and primary
prevention of fractures in high-risk groups

Background: There is currently no standard practice for the monitoring of patients receiving treatment
for osteoporosis. Repeated dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is commonly used for monitoring
treatment response, but it has its limitations. Bone turnover markers have advantages over DXA as they are
non-invasive, relatively cheap and can detect changes in bone turnover rates earlier. However, they do
have disadvantages, particularly high within- and between-patient variability. The ability of bone turnover
markers to identify treatment non-responders and predict future fracture risk has yet to be established.
Objectives: We aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness, test accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and
cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for monitoring the response to osteoporosis treatment.
Data sources: We searched 12 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library
and trials registries) without language restrictions from inception to March 2012. We hand-searched three
relevant journals for the 12 months prior to May 2012, and websites of five test manufacturers and the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were
also searched.
Review methods: A systematic review of test accuracy, clinical utility, reliability and reproducibility,
and cost-effectiveness of two formation and two resorption bone turnover markers, in patients being
treated for osteoporosis with any of bisphosphonate [alendronate (Fosamax®, MSD), risedronate (Actonel®,
Warner Chilcott Company), zolendronate (Zometa®, Novartis)], raloxifene (Evista®, Eli Lilly and Company
Ltd), strontium ranelate (Protelos®, Servier Laboratories Ltd), denosumab (Prolia®, Amgen Ltd) or
teriparatide (Forsteo®, Eli Lilly and Company Ltd), was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Given the breadth of the review
question, a range of study designs and outcome measures were eligible. The development of a decision
model was planned to determine the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for informing changes in
patient management if clinical effectiveness could be established.
Results: Forty-two studies (70 publications) met the inclusion criteria; none evaluated cost-effectiveness.
Only five were randomised controlled trials (RCTs); these assessed only the impact of bone marker
monitoring on aspects of adherence. No RCTs evaluated the effectiveness of bone turnover marker

monitoring on treatment management. One trial suggested that feedback of a good response decreased
non-persistence [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.95], and feedback of a
poor response increased non-persistence (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.89); it is not clear whether or not the
trial recruited a population representative of that seen in clinical practice. Thirty-three studies reported
results of some assessment of test accuracy, mostly correlations between changes in bone turnover and
bone mineral density. Only four studies reported on intra- or interpatient reliability and reproducibility in
treated patients. Overall, the results were inconsistent and inconclusive, owing to considerable clinical
heterogeneity across the studies and the generally small sample sizes. As clinical effectiveness of bone
turnover monitoring could not be established, a decision-analytic model was not developed.
Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence to inform the choice of which bone turnover marker to use
in routine clinical practice to monitor osteoporosis treatment response. The research priority is to identify
the most promising treatment–test combinations for evaluation in subsequent, methodologically sound,
RCTs. In order to determine whether or not bone turnover marker monitoring improves treatment
management decisions, and ultimately impacts on patient outcomes in terms of reduced incidence of
fracture, RCTs are required. Given the large number of potential patient population–treatment–test
combinations, the most promising combinations would initially need to be identified in order to ensure
that any RCTs focus on evaluating those strategies. As a result, the research priority is to identify these
promising combinations, by either conducting small variability studies or initiating a patient registry to
collect standardised data.

Scientific summary
Background
Osteoporosis is a progressive systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mass and
micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and
susceptibility to fracture. Approximately 3 million people in the UK have osteoporosis, with about 20% of
women aged 60–69 years being affected. There are approximately 230,000 osteoporotic fractures every
year. Medical therapies available for osteoporosis include bisphosphonates, raloxifene, strontium ranelate,
teriparatide and denosumab.
There is currently no standard practice for the monitoring of patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis.
Repeated dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a commonly used diagnostic test for monitoring
treatment response but has its limitations, including the time needed prior to a repeated measure to detect
changes in bone mineral density (BMD); limited access to the technology; cost (average £72 per scan);
and evidence of the limited value in regular monitoring of BMD in patients on bisphosphonate therapy.
Bone turnover markers may offer an alternative monitoring strategy. They measure bone resorption
or formation. Bone turnover markers have advantages over DXA for monitoring response to osteoporosis
therapy; they are non-invasive, relatively cheap (commonly £20 to £25 per test), and have the ability to
detect changes in bone turnover rates as early as 2 weeks for some therapies, and between 3 and 6 months
for most. However, they do have disadvantages, most notably the variability across samples (both within
and between patients). This leads to the need for a proportionately high percentage change in the rate of
the bone turnover marker being measured in order to identify treatment responders. In addition, their
ability to identify treatment non-responders and their use as independent predictors of future fracture
risk has yet to be established.
Objectives
The primary aims of this assessment are to determine the clinical effectiveness, test accuracy, test reliability
and reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of monitoring regimens with at least one of four bone turnover
markers, namely procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
(BALP), carboxy-terminal telopeptide cross-linked type 1 collagen (CTX) and type 1 collagen amino-terminal
telopeptide (NTX), in patients with osteoporosis being treated with any of bisphosphonate, raloxifene,
strontium ranelate, denosumab or teriparatide.
Methods
The review was conducted systematically following the general principles recommended in the Centre for
Reviews and Dissemination’s guidance for undertaking reviews in health care and the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Data were sought systematically from
12 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library) from inception up to
March 2012. These were supplemented by searches of reference lists of included studies and relevant
reviews, recent contents pages of relevant journals, and relevant websites. Inclusion was restricted to
studies in adults (> 18 years of age) but not by date or language of publication.
To be included in the review, a study had to be either (1) a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a
monitoring regimen that included at least one bone turnover marker test with a monitoring regimen

without bone turnover marker testing, or a different bone turnover marker, and reporting either change in
patient management strategies and/or treatment adherence rates; (2) a study evaluating the impact of bone
turnover marker test results on the decision-making process, that also reported the subsequent rate of
fracture in the population; (3) a prospective study that compared the results of bone turnover marker tests
with the results of bone biopsy or a composite reference standard of BMD and subsequent fracture
outcome; (4) a prospective study that reported at least a p-value for the association between changes in
bone turnover markers and BMD, biopsy, and/or the incidence of fractures from correlation or multivariate
regression analyses; (5) a prospective study reporting inter- and/or intrapatient variability on bone turnover
marker test results for patients receiving one of the treatments being evaluated; or (6) a cost-effectiveness
analysis of bone turnover marker monitoring strategies. Non-effectiveness prospective studies had to recruit
at least 20 patients with osteoporosis who were receiving one of the treatments of interest.
An economic model was to be developed only if sufficient evidence was found to establish the clinical
effectiveness of bone turnover marker monitoring on treatment management.
Results
Forty-two studies (across 70 publications) met the inclusion criteria, all of which were included in the
review of clinical effectiveness. Of the 42 studies, five were RCTs. Of the 37 non-randomised studies,
21 were cohorts derived from the treatment arms of RCTs, 15 were uncontrolled cohort studies and one
was a controlled cohort study. All included studies were judged to be low quality. The high level of clinical
heterogeneity across the studies precluded the use of standard meta-analytic techniques. A narrative
synthesis was therefore employed.
Clinical effectiveness
Five RCTs and one post hoc analysis from a RCT assessed the effectiveness of feedback of bone turnover
marker results on adherence, compliance and/or persistence. Five trials reporting on compliance showed
little difference between the feedback and no feedback arms: high rates of baseline compliance mean that
these are unlikely to be representative of clinical practice. Only one trial reported on persistence. Notably,
feedback of a good urinary NTX (uNTX) response (> 30% reduction) was associated with a decreased rate
of discontinuation [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.95]. In contrast, feedback
of a poor uNTX response was associated with an increased rate of discontinuation (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.27
to 3.89). Two RCTs reported on the quality of life (QoL) using the osteoporosis-specific questionnaire; these
variably reported small improvements for patients receiving feedback in the overall, feeling informed,
satisfaction and confidence scores. No studies were identified for the evaluation of the effectiveness of
bone turnover marker monitoring on treatment management.
Test accuracy
Thirty-three studies reported results of some assessment of test accuracy, 23 reported only the results
of correlation analyses, four only the results of multiple regression analyses, and four reported both.
Five studies reported predictive accuracy using alternative analytical methods; three also reported results
from correlation and/or multiple regression analyses. Therefore, most of the data identified for the review of
test accuracy were results from correlation analyses; the majority of these evaluated associations between
changes in bone turnover markers with changes in BMD. Although there were a number of statistically
significant associations between these two measures across the different treatments, the vast majority had
small effect sizes and were considered weak (r < 0.50). The studies that used regression analyses to adjust
for confounding factors gave some indication that changes in bone turnover markers may be significantly
associated with subsequent changes in BMD. However, there were too few of these studies to draw any
firm conclusions. Studies assessing the association between changes in bone turnover markers with either
biopsy results or fracture outcomes were uncommon. Two studies used biopsy and seven used fracture, and
these gave some indication that changes in bone turnover markers may be significantly associated with
changes in fracture risk; however, again, there were too few studies to draw any firm conclusions.

Overall, the results from the studies utilising correlation and regression analyses were inconsistent and
inconclusive. This may be due to the considerable clinical heterogeneity across the included studies in
terms of the definitions used to identify those with osteoporosis, patient populations recruited, the
treatment regimens administered, and the type and timing of the tests being evaluated. Most of the
included studies had small sample sizes, resulting in low statistical power to detect significant associations.
Test reliability and reproducibility
Four studies reported signal to noise (S/N) ratios for a bone turnover marker in patients being treated
with etidronate, teriparatide or raloxifene. Within-study comparisons showed that serum P1NP (sP1NP) had
a higher S/N ratio than serum CTX (sCTX) at 25 weeks, and a higher S/N ratio than serum BALP (sBALP)
at 6 months.
Cost-effectiveness
No studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover
marker monitoring strategies.
Economic model
Given that the review could not establish the clinical effectiveness of bone turnover marker monitoring
strategies, a decision-analytic model could not be produced and, consequently, an expected value of
perfect information could not be undertaken to assess the value of future research.
To assist future developers of any decision-analytic model in investigating the cost-effectiveness of bone
turnover marker monitoring strategies, we undertook a scoping review of current modelling methods in
related decision problems. We also discussed the gaps in the current evidence base that would be
essential to address before any such cost-effectiveness analysis of bone maker monitoring regimens could
be undertaken.
Of the modelling strategies identified, 12 modelled measures of adherence and one modelled treatment
change. Ten of the models incorporated compliance as a binary variable, using a variety of cut-off points for
what constituted compliance. Eleven models incorporated persistence, modelled as the percentage of
patients initiating and subsequently discontinuing treatment at different time points. Only six studies
modelled compliance, non-compliance and persistence separately, incorporating the different aspects of
adherence. Some models included an estimate of primary non-adherence. The one model that incorporated
treatment change allowed for switching to a second-line treatment if results of a bone turnover marker test
during follow-up led to the conclusion that compliance or response to treatment was inadequate.
The key part of any future cost-effectiveness analysis of bone turnover marker tests for monitoring response
to treatment for osteoporosis is accounting for test accuracy, the prognostic outcomes for true-positive,
false-positive, true-negative and false-negative test results, and the effect of feeding back the results of
bone turnover marker tests on patient adherence to treatment. These data were either absent completely,
insufficient given the different tests and treatments, or applicable to populations with unrealistic adherence
rates for clinical practice.
Discussion
The systematic review of clinical effectiveness found no evidence evaluating the impact of treatment
monitoring regimens that included a relevant bone turnover marker on treatment management decisions.
The review identified limited data assessing the effect of bone turnover marker feedback on patient
compliance, persistence and/or adherence to treatment, the results of which suggested that the positive
feedback results encouraged patient persistence.

Most of the data relating to test accuracy were in the form of correlations between changes in bone
turnover markers (usually between 1 month and 6 months of starting treatment) and subsequent changes
in BMD (usually between 1 year and 3 years after the start of treatment). Treatment-induced changes in
BMD account for a limited proportion of the observed reduction in fracture risk and, therefore, BMD is a
poor surrogate for fracture risk; using BMD as a surrogate for the evaluation of the predictive accuracy of
bone turnover markers to identify patients on treatment who remain at risk of fracture is inappropriate.
In addition, results of correlation analyses are influenced by sample size: the greater the sample size, the
more likely a correlation will be statistically significant from zero. Although there were a number of
statistically significant correlations, these on the whole suggested weak correlations. These data, and the
data from studies conducting multiple regression analyses, were further limited by the considerable
between-study clinical heterogeneity in terms of the definitions of osteoporosis, patient populations,
treatment regimens and the type and timing of tests being evaluated.
In terms of the evaluation of test reliability and reproducibility, some evidence was available that suggested
sP1NP may have a greater S/N ratio than sBALP and sCTX at a short-term follow-up, but the data on this
outcome were sparse and longer-term follow-up data absent.
The systematic review of cost-effectiveness identified no studies evaluating different treatment monitoring
strategies, where BALP, P1NP, CTX or NTX was incorporated as part of one of the strategies, and there
was insufficient evidence from the clinical review to develop a de novo decision-analytic model.
Overall, the evidence required to address the decision problem was lacking. The evidence that was
available was heterogeneous and of poor quality. Consequently, it was impossible to draw any conclusion
as to whether or not bone turnover markers were able to identify non-responders or predict fracture risk
independently of BMD in patients receiving osteoporosis treatment. There are a number of uncertainties
that remain in need of clarifying; these include:
l the ability of changes in bone turnover markers to identify treatment non-responders
l the ability of changes in bone turnover markers to impact on compliance, persistence and adherence
to each of the treatments being evaluated
l the accuracy of changes in bone turnover markers to predict future fracture risk
l the ability of bone turnover markers to inform treatment change
l the most appropriate timing of the conduct of bone turnover marker testing; this may vary depending
upon the treatment–test combination
l which bone turnover marker is superior in terms of its ability to identify treatment non-responder and
predict fracture risks for monitoring specific osteoporosis treatments
l the reliability and reproducibility of bone turnover marker tests in patients receiving treatment
for osteoporosis
l the most cost-effective monitoring regimen for patients being treated with bisphosphonates,
raloxifene, strontium ranelate, teriparatide or denosumab.
Conclusions
Implications for service provision
The lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness and the heterogeneity and poor quality of the available
evidence on the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of bone turnover markers for monitoring response
to osteoporosis treatment precluded the possibility of making any recommendations on the choice of bone
turnover marker being used in routine clinical practice for its superiority to monitor osteoporosis treatment
response. In addition, the evidence to support the use of bone turnover marker feedback results to
improve patient adherence to osteoporosis treatment was not convincing.

Suggested research priorities
In order to determine whether or not bone turnover marker monitoring improves treatment management
decisions and ultimately impacts on patient outcomes in terms of reduced incidence of fracture, RCTs are
required. The predictive accuracy of bone turnover markers for future fracture outcomes in patients receiving
osteoporosis treatment could be investigated using prospective, long-term observational studies with large
sample sizes. However, in view of the large number of potential patient population–treatment–test
combinations, the most promising combinations would need to be identified in order to ensure the more
costly and time-consuming studies, such as RCTs, focus on evaluating those strategies. Therefore, we
consider the research priority to identify these promising treatment–test combinations. This can be achieved
by either conducting small variability studies or initiating a patient registry to collect standardised data. The
former would be quicker, easier and less costly, but the quality of the data would be poorer. Further, prior to
establishing the latter it is likely that a more widespread use of bone turnover markers in clinical practice
would be required. Once the most promising treatment–test combinations have been identified,
well-designed RCTs can be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of those monitoring regimens; this would
include measuring outcomes such as the proportion of non-responders, adherence rates, treatment
management decisions and fracture outcome. Data from these RCTs along with other sources can then be
included in a decision-analytic model in order to investigate cost-effectiveness.

Chapter 1 Background
Description of health problem
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a progressive systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural
deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture.1,2
Bone turnover (remodelling)
Bone turnover is the process of resorption followed by replacement by new bone with little change in
shape, and it occurs throughout a person’s life. Osteoclasts break down bone (bone resorption), releasing
the minerals, resulting in a transfer of calcium from bone fluid to the blood. The osteoclast attaches to the
osteon (layers of compact bone tissue surrounding a central canal), and secretes collagenase and other
enzymes. Calcium, magnesium, phosphate and products of collagen are released into the extracellular fluid
as the osteoclasts tunnel into the mineralised bone. Osteoblasts are mature bone cells responsible for bone
formation and ossification. They produce the organic portion of the matrix of bone tissue, osteoid, which is
composed mainly of type I collagen, and are responsible for mineralisation of the osteoid matrix.
Ossification fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream. Repeated stress,
such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of high stress.
Remodelling in adults repairs micro-damage to bone and plays a role in the regulation of calcium
homeostasis. An imbalance in the bone remodelling processes in adults is thought to impact on bone
strength as a result of reductions in bone volume and mineralisation, loss of trabeculae, deterioration of
trabecular connectivity, and the formation of resorption cavities and trabecular perforations.3,4 Therefore,
an increase in bone turnover where resorption exceeds formation is not only inversely correlated with bone
mineral density (BMD), but may also alter bone architecture and porosity, increasing the risk of fracture
beyond that due to reduced BMD, and can therefore be an independent predictor of fracture risk.3–6
Diagnosis
Osteoporosis causes no symptoms until a bone is broken. As osteoporosis is associated with low bone
density, bone density scanning [using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)] has become the most
commonly used diagnostic technique.2 There are accepted diagnostic criteria based on DXA: osteopenia
(low bone mass) is present when the BMD is between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the mean
value for young adults (BMD T-score of –1 to –2.5); osteoporosis is diagnosed when BMD is < 2.5 standard
deviations below young adults’ (BMD T-score of < –2.5).7
Risk of fracture
A reduction in BMD results in the thinning of the trabeculae and an increase in the fragility of the bones.8
Therefore, people diagnosed with osteoporosis have an increased risk of suffering low trauma (fragility)
fractures. When BMD is measured by DXA, a reduction of 1 standard deviation in BMD is reportedly
associated with a 50–150% increase in the risk of osteoporotic fracture.9 Increasing age is one of the
major risk factors for osteoporosis; after 35 years of age bone loss increases gradually as part of the
natural ageing process.2 By 75 years of age, approximately half of the population will have osteoporosis.
In addition, there is an increased risk of falling which increases the risk of fracture; one in two women and
one in five men over the age of 50 in the UK will fracture a bone, mainly as a result of skeletal fragility.2,10
The most common fractures in people with osteoporosis are of the wrists, hips and spinal bones; these are
most common in older people, but younger people can sometimes be affected.8,11

According to recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance [clinical guideline
(CG) 146], assessment of the risk of fragility fractures should be considered in:12
l all women aged 65 years and over and in all men aged 75 years and over
l in women aged under 65 years and in men aged under 75 years in the presence of risk factors,
for example:
¢ previous fragility fracture
¢ current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoids
¢ history of falls
¢ family history of hip fracture
¢ other causes of secondary osteoporosis
¢ low body mass index (BMI) (< 18.5 kg/m2
)
¢ smoking
¢ alcohol intake of more than 14 units per week for women and more than 21 units per week for men.
An assessment tool for assessing fracture risk, FRAX®, has been developed by the World Health
Organization (WHO).13 The factors taken into account are age, gender, weight, height, previous fracture,
parental history of hip fracture, smoking status, the use of oral glucocorticoid steroids, a diagnosis of
rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of a disorder strongly associated with osteoporosis and alcohol
consumption, with or without BMD as determined using DXA.12,14
Treatments for osteoporosis
Diet and exercise can be modified to improve a person’s fracture risk. Exercises considered best for
people with osteoporosis are those that (1) are thought to have an effect on density and strength, such as
weight-bearing exercises that cause force on the bones like jogging, stair climbing, walking briskly and
resistance exercises, and (2) can reduce the risk of falling, such as balance training (e.g. tai chi), leg
strengthening and flexibility training (e.g. yoga). Exercises that people with osteoporosis are advised to
avoid are those that might increase the risk of falling, those that involve twisting the spine or bending
from the waist, high-impact activities such as high-intensity aerobics or jumping and the use of excessive
weight during resistance exercise. A diet containing foods rich in calcium and vitamin D (vitamin D is
required for the absorption of calcium) or the use of calcium and vitamin D supplements can also improve
bone strength.
The most common medical therapies for osteoporosis are bisphosphonate drugs. Bisphosphonates inhibit
the activity of mature osteoclasts and reduce the rate of resorption.4 The most commonly prescribed
bisphosphonate is generic alendronate; other bisphosphonates include etidronate, risedronate (now
available in generic form), ibandronate, and zoledronate. The recommended dose of alendronate is one
70-mg tablet per week, rather than 10 mg daily as originally prescribed, to reduce the incidence of
gastrointestinal adverse effects and increase adherence. A strict technique must be adhered to when
taking oral bisphosphonates to ensure satisfactory absorption. They must be taken on an empty stomach
first thing in the morning, while remaining upright to prevent reflux, at least 30 minutes before the
first food, drink or other medication of the day. The tablet should be taken with plain water only; other
drinks (including mineral water), food and some medicines are likely to reduce the absorption of
bisphosphonates.15 Intravenously administered bisphosphonates are available; the recommended doses are
3 mg 3-monthly of ibandronate, or 5 mg annually of zoledronate. Pamidronate is not licensed for the
treatment of osteoporosis but has been widely used off-licence at a dose of 30 mg quarterly.
Other medical therapies available include:
l raloxifene (Evista®, Eli Lilly and Company Ltd): a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which
is a synthetic hormone that copies the effects of oestrogen on the bones
BACKGROUND
2
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

l strontium ranelate (Protelos®, Servier Laboratories Ltd): a strontium(II) salt of ranelic acid, which is a
dual-action bone agent that stimulates new bone growth and reduces bone loss
l teriparatide (Forsteo®, Eli Lilly and Company Ltd): a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone
(PTH 1–34) that helps regulate calcium levels and the activity of cells involved in bone formation
l denosumab (Prolia®, Amgen Ltd): a monoclonal antibody that targets the RANK ligand
l hormone replacement therapy (HRT): a mix of hormones (oestrogens, progesterone or progestins,
and sometimes testosterone) prescribed to post-menopausal women (natural or surgically induced) to
reduce the symptoms caused by reduced circulating oestrogen and progesterone. The risk of
development and progression of osteoporosis can therefore be reduced by the maintenance of
oestrogen levels.
Burden of the disease on the NHS
Approximately 3 million people in the UK have osteoporosis, with about 20% of women aged 60–69
affected. There are thought to be about 230,000 osteoporotic fractures every year, with broken wrists,
hips and spinal bones being the most common. Of the 60,000 people who suffer osteoporotic hip
fractures each year, 15–20% are likely to die within a year from causes related to the fracture.2
As stated in Diagnosis, above, there are a range of treatments available for osteoporosis, and the costs of
these vary (pamidronate has not been costed as it is not licensed for use in osteoporosis):16
l Generic sodium alendronate: a 28-tablet pack of 10-mg tablets is £1.44 (approximately £19 annually);
a four-tablet pack of 70 mg for once-weekly administration is £1.10 (approximately £14 annually).
Fosamax® (MSD) costs £23.12 for 28 10-mg tablets and £22.80 for four 70-mg once-weekly tablets.
l Generic sodium risedronate: a 28-tablet pack of 5-mg tablets is £17.99 (approximately £220 annually);
a four-tablet pack of 35 mg for once-weekly administration is £19.12 (approximately £230 annually).
l Zoledronate: Zometa® (Novartis) costs £174.17 for 4 mg in 5 ml, and Aclasta® (Novartis) costs £253.38
for 5 mg in 100 ml – 5 mg administered once annually.
l Strontium ranelate (Protelos®, Servier) costs £25.60 for 28 sachets each containing 2 g of granules daily
(approximately £330 annually).
l Denosumab (Prolia®, Amgen Ltd) costs £183.00 for 60 mg/ml in a 1-ml prefilled syringe – 60 mg
administered 6-monthly (£366 annually).
l Raloxifene (Evista®, Daiichi Sankyo) costs £17.06 for 28, and £59.59 for 84, 60-mg tablets – 60 mg
daily (approximately £220 annually).
l Teriparatide (Forteo®, Eli Lilly and Company Ltd) costs £271.88 for 250 µg/ml in a 3-ml pre-filled
pen – 20 µg self-administered daily (approximately £3540 annually).
According to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), in 2005–6 in England there were 5759 consultations
and 4034 admissions (2368 emergency) for osteoporosis with a pathological fracture, and a further
8725 consultations and 8313 admissions (716 emergency) without pathological fracture.17 For surgical
interventions for fractures of the spine and hip (not only those associated with osteoporosis), there were
809 consultations and 667 admissions (353 emergency) for fixations of spinal fractures (approximately
26% in patients 60 years and older), and 46,812 consultations and 46,191 admissions (1611 emergency)
for primary total prosthetic replacement of hip joint [depending on method used, approximately 50% (not
using cement) to 85% (using cement) 60 years and older].17 Given the discrepancies in the numbers of hip
replacements in the elderly and consultations of osteoporotic fractures, the incidence/consultation rate for
osteoporosis may be underestimated. A recent report published by the Royal College of Physicians stated
that only 32% (1933 out of 6083) of non-hip fracture and 67% (2324 out of 3484) of hip fracture
patients had a clinical assessment for osteoporosis/fracture risk.18 Osteoporosis reportedly costs the NHS
and government £2.3B per year (£6M per day).2

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance
NICE has produced a number of technology appraisals (TAs) and CGs that have some relevance to this
area. Three relevant TAs have been published: TA160 (Osteoporosis – primary prevention; postmenopausal
women),19 TA161 (Osteoporosis – secondary prevention including strontium ranelate; postmenopausal
women)20 and TA204 (Osteoporotic fractures – denosumab).21
For the primary prevention of fractures, alendronate is recommended as the first-line treatment for most
women at risk of fractures. Risedronate, etidronate and strontium ranelate are alternative treatments for
post-menopausal women who cannot adhere to the required alendronate regimen, or those women with
pre-specified combinations of T-score, age and number of independent clinical risk factors; strontium
ranelate is not recommended as a first-line treatment for osteoporosis. Raloxifene is not a recommended
treatment for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures.19 The recommendations for the
secondary prevention of fractures are similar to those for primary prevention. The two differences are that
(1) strontium ranelate can be used as a first-line treatment and (2) raloxifene is recommended as an
alternative treatment for post-menopausal women who cannot adhere to alendronate, or in women with
pre-specified combinations of T-score, age and number of independent clinical risk factors.20 Denosumab
has now also been added to the list of alternative second-line treatments for the primary or secondary
prevention of fractures.21
There are also four potentially relevant CGs available that deal with the management of independent risk
factors for fracture: CG146 (Osteoporosis fragility fracture),12 CG21 (Falls: the assessment and prevention
of falls in older people),22 CG59 (Osteoarthritis: the care and management of osteoarthritis in adults)23 and
CG79 (Rheumatoid arthritis: the management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults).24
This review will focus on patients being treated for osteoporosis with any of bisphosphonate, raloxifene,
strontium ranelate, teriparatide or denosumab.
Description of the technologies under assessment
Bone turnover markers
Biochemical markers of bone turnover are used to monitor treatment response and may prove to be more
useful than serial BMD measurements as they are non-invasive, relatively cheap compared with DXA, and
there is an increased availability of auto-analysers in clinical chemistry laboratories.
Formation markers (detects products from the action of osteoblasts)
Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP): serum alkaline phosphatase has several dimeric isoforms that
originate from a range of tissues (liver, bone, intestine, spleen, kidney and placenta), with approximately
40–50% of the total alkaline phosphatase activity arising from the bone as a result of osteoblast activity.25
The bone-specific isoform can be detected with immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies.26,27 There are
two main types of assay to measure BALP: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; measures BALP
enzyme activity) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA; measures BALP in protein mass units).28 The least
significant change between a sample taken at baseline to 3 months after commencement of treatment
has been reported as 30%.27 It has been suggested that BALP testing should occur at baseline before
starting osteoporosis therapy and again at 3 to 6 months after commencement of therapy.29
Procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP): anti-P1NP antibodies are used to detect the trimeric
structure of P1NP by ELISA or radioimmunoassay. It has been claimed that P1NP is a more sensitive marker
of bone formation rate than other available formation markers, and therefore is particularly useful for
monitoring bone formation therapies and antiresorptive therapies.26,29 As with BALP, it is recommended
that the test be performed at baseline before starting osteoporosis therapy and again 3–6 months later.29
BACKGROUND
4
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

Osteocalcin (or bone gla protein): a small protein, detected using ELISA or radioimmunoassay that is rapidly
degraded in the serum so that intact and fragmented segments from osteoblast activity coexist in the
serum. Advantages of osteocalcin have been reported as being its tissue specificity, wide availability, and
relatively low within-person variation; however, heterogeneity of the fragments in the serum is thought to
limit its use.26 Osteocalcin is a marker of corticosteroid effects on osteoblasts and is decreased in patients
receiving acute high-dose steroids, a risk factor for osteoporosis;27 osteocalcin may also be affected by use
of warfarin.29 It is recommended that the test be performed at baseline before starting osteoporosis
therapy and again 3–6 months later.29
Procollagen type 1 carboxy-terminal propeptide (P1CP): the carboxy-terminal propeptide cleaved during the
assembly of collagen fibres, and detected using ELISA or radioimmunoassay.30
Resorption markers (detects products from the action of osteoclasts)
Carboxy-terminal telopeptide cross-linked type 1 collagen (CTX): peptide fragments from the
carboxy-terminal end of type 1 collagen produced during osteoclastic resorption and detected in the
urine or serum using ELISA.29
Type I collagen amino-terminal telopeptide (NTX): peptide fragments from the amino terminal end of type
1 collagen produced during osteoclastic resorption and detected in the urine or serum with competitive
inhibition ELISA or a chemiluminescence assay.27,29 The least significant change between samples taken at
3-month intervals is 50%. Suppression of NTX by more than 50% from baseline has been reported as
being expected as early as 3 months after commencement of bisphosphonate therapy, but routine
follow-up may be left to 6 months post therapy.27 It has been recommended that the test be performed at
baseline before starting osteoporosis therapy and again 3 to 6 months later.29
Urine deoxypyridinoline: derived only from bone matrix degradation, released from type I collagen.
Excretion of deoxypyridinoline expressed as ratio to creatinine excretion. Urine deoxypyridinoline is
detected by high-performance liquid chromatography or competitive ELISA.27 Increases of between two
and three times the upper limits of normal have been reported in people with osteoporosis, primary
hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, thyrotoxicosis and several inflammatory conditions, though the biggest
increases (four or more times upper limit of normal) are seen in immobilisation, Paget’s disease of bone
and metastatic cancer.27 A decrease in the pretreatment value of > 30% has been considered indicative of
a good response in osteoporosis.27
The Supra-Regional Assay Service (SAS) is a UK-based service for the analysis and clinical interpretation of a
wide range of specialised diagnostics tests; those offering BALP, uNTX, serum osteocalcin and urine
deoxypyridinoline are listed on the SAS website.27
Variability in bone turnover markers
Several factors can impact on the bone turnover marker levels, causing variability across samples, which
can reduce repeatability and comparability, both within patients and between patients. These include
specimen collection and storage;25,31–35 differences between analytical methods used;32,34 temporal
variations (diurnal, menstrual, seasonal);25,31–35 diet and fasting;36 patient characteristics (age, gender or
ethnicity);25,31,33,35 concomitant medication other than osteoporosis medications [HRT, anabolic agents,
glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists or oral
contraception];25,31 and comorbid conditions (renal impairment, liver disease, diabetes, thyroid disease,
osteomalacia, systematic inflammatory diseases, degenerative joint disease, conditions causing immobility,
or eating disorders).25,31,33,35
Intrapatient variability for serum markers is lower than for urinary markers.34 Some tests are more accurate
when monitoring the response to specific treatments (e.g. CTX with bisphosphonates). Some tests have
the advantage of not requiring the patient to fast prior to sampling (e.g. P1NP), or are less affected by
diurnal variations (P1NP and BALP), and/or have lower overall intraindividual variability (BALP) than other

bone turnover markers.37 Each of these tests also has disadvantages: CTX has a large circadian rhythm,
and therefore repeat sampling must be done at the same time of day, fasting is required prior to
sampling, and the marker requires freezing soon after sampling as it can be unstable; BALP is affected by
cross-reactivity with the liver form of alkaline phosphatase, limiting its use in patients with liver disease;
and P1NP has a higher cost compared with other bone turnover markers.37 Given the advantages that
CTX, P1NP and BALP offer, and the availability of NTX, these are the bone turnover markers that will be
investigated in the current review.
Use of bone turnover markers
The use of bone turnover markers varies greatly across the UK, in terms of both the test used and the
frequency of its measurement. Several factors will need to be considered when choosing the bone
turnover marker to be used, not least the availability of the assay methods. Bone turnover markers have a
number of potential uses, including:6,37
1. predicting bone loss
2. identifying people at risk of primary or secondary osteoporosis and fracture
3. predicting treatment response prior to commencement
4. monitoring the response to osteoporosis treatment; identifying non-responders, which will include
those not adhering with osteoporosis treatment (including patients not taking the medication or not
following the instructions for administration)
5. identifying oversuppression of bone turnover in patient on long-term osteoporosis therapy
6. monitoring of people who have been on long-term treatment, or shown signs of oversuppression, and
are taking a ‘treatment holiday’.
The main focus of this systematic review will be role 4: monitoring the response and non-response to
osteoporosis therapy (and change in fracture risk).
Monitoring response to treatments for osteoporosis
There is currently no standard practice for the monitoring of patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis.
The options include the use of repeated DXA, repeated measures of bone turnover markers, clinical review,
or a combination of these. The use of DXA to monitor the response to osteoporosis treatment has
limitations. Firstly, detectable changes in bone density due to treatment can take up to 2 years to become
apparent;38 therefore, the identification of non-responders to treatment is delayed. Secondly, there is limited
access to the technology and the test is relatively expensive (average £72 per scan). Thirdly, there is evidence
that there is limited value in the regular monitoring of BMD in patients on bisphosphonate therapy.39,40
As stated earlier, the relationship between bone turnover and bone density and architecture means that
the rate of bone turnover may be an independent predictor of fracture risk;3–6 this can be measured using
one or more of the bone turnover markers listed above. However, it is still unclear whether or not changes
in bone turnover detected by bone turnover markers are reliable surrogate measures for improved bone
density and architecture, and consequently accurate predictors of future fracture risk. Two studies have
suggested that bone turnover markers can have independent predictive value in assessment of fracture
risk.41 If biochemical markers of bone turnover are reliable indicators of future fracture risk, their use may
prove advantageous compared with serial BMD measurements, as not only are they non-invasive, relatively
cheap compared with DXA, and the availability of auto-analysers in clinical chemistry laboratories is
increasing, but a response to treatment can be detected much earlier than with DXA.
Changes in bone turnover rates have been detected in post-menopausal women within as early as 2 weeks
after starting HRT,42 although the peak accuracy of changes in bone turnover markers to predict fracture
risk in response to osteoporosis treatment may be later than this, between 3 and 12 months after initiating
treatment, depending on the treatment and bone turnover marker used.43–46 The ability to identify
non-responders early within the treatment can be beneficial for patients by allowing early changes in
management strategy if deemed necessary. The definition of treatment success varies depending upon

the baseline risk of the patient being treated; in some patients a reduction in bone turnover would be
considered a treatment success, but in others success may be a stabilisation of bone turnover. For all
patients a continued increase in bone turnover rates would be considered a treatment failure. The
definitions used throughout this project will reflect clinical practice and be based upon evidence for least
clinical significant change.
There is a complex association between changes in bone turnover and fracture risk that is influenced by
the treatment–bone turnover marker combination; the observed change in bone turnover markers will
depend upon the treatment being administered. In studies of raloxifene, risedronate, alendronate and
zoledronic acid, bone turnover markers have been reported as explaining between 28% and 77% of
fracture risk reduction.47
Bisphosphonates are antiresorptive therapies, and therefore they reduce the rate of bone resorption. Bone
resorption is closely coupled to bone formation; consequently, there is usually a subsequent reduction in
the rate of bone formation. This results in a transient uncoupling of bone turnover, which leads to a small
increase in BMD. This increase in BMD may account in part for the decrease in fracture risk, but the
reduction in bone turnover may independently improve bone strength by improving bone architecture and
porosity.48 Both raloxifene and denosumab reduce bone resorption, and therefore act as antiresorptive
therapies; decreases in both bone resorption markers and subsequently bone formation markers should be
observed in treatment responders as with bisphosphonates.
Teriparatide causes a small, transient increase in serum calcium, mainly due to the stimulation of tubular
reabsorption of calcium from the proximal kidney tubules and increased calcium absorption from the
bowel, but in a small part by increasing bone resorption (hence chronically elevated PTH can deplete
bone). However, intermittent administration of PTH (i.e. daily injections of teriparatide) activates
osteoblasts more than osteoclasts, stimulating new bone formation and increasing BMD. Therefore, a
positive response in bone formation markers would be expected in treatment responders, with a
subsequent increase in bone resorption markers due to the coupling of the processes, the opposite
response to that seen with antiresorptive therapies.
Strontium ranelate increases new bone formation as well as reducing bone resorption and is classed as a
dual-action bone agent. These effects are more modest than those seen with anabolic and antiresorptive
treatments, with smaller positive changes in bone formation and negative changes in bone resorption
markers, respectively. However, strontium ranelate appears to lead to persistent uncoupling of
bone turnover.
The interpretation of changes in bone turnover markers is also influenced by the type of sample used:
serum or urine. The intraindividual variability is greater for urine markers, giving serum markers a better
signal to noise (S/N) ratio;34 the percentage change in a urinary biomarker needed to indicate a treatment
response (least significant change) is greater than that required for a serum biomarker.
Treatment non-response
Treatment non-response could have a number of causes, including non-compliance; non-persistence; an
underlying, untreated cause of the osteoporosis; an inability to absorb the drug; and/or test error. The
most common reasons are thought to be non-compliance, non-persistence, or both (non-adherence).
Adherence to osteoporosis treatment is known to be poor, particularly to bisphosphonates, which are often
associated with gastrointestinal upset and sometimes oesophagitis.49 According to the summary of product
characteristics (SPC), gastrointestinal upset with alendronate is common (occurring in 1–10% of patients)
and oesophagitis is rare (0.01–0.1% of patients).15 The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects associated
with osteoporosis treatments is thought to be higher than that specified in the SPC; NICE guidance states
that up to one-third of post-menopausal women may experience some type of gastrointestinal upset.50,51

put down to taking alendronate with little or no water, lying down during or shortly after taking the tablet,
continuing to take alendronate after the onset of symptoms, or pre-existing oesophageal disorders.49
Patients are now given strict instructions on the technique for taking bisphosphonate drugs, as described
previously. Adverse events have been reported in nearly 50% of patients; however, a 2006 Cochrane
review showed no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between bisphosphonates
and placebo.52 In addition to the potential for adverse events, bisphosphonates are difficult to absorb.
Patients have to adhere to strict instructions on how to take oral preparations; if these are not followed,
the effectiveness of the drug is likely to be reduced and gastrointestinal side effects are more likely
to be experienced.15,53
Bone turnover markers can identify treatment non-responders, and therefore they may be a useful
method for monitoring non-adherence with treatment, as this is a major reason for non-response.6
Adherence to treatment can be improved with the introduction of treatment regimens that require
less frequent administration of the medication,54–59 and the availability of intravenously administered
bisphosphonates.53,59 The move to the use of intravenously administered treatment based on the results
of the bone turnover markers could have cost implications; anaphylaxis could occur and, if experienced,
it may require hospitalisation. Monitoring adherence through the use of bone turnover markers is not a
main focus of the systematic review; however, where this information is reported it will be extracted
and summarised.
Cost of the technologies under assessment
In England, in 2010–11, DXA cost, on average, £72 per scan (range £45 to £85: Health Resource Group
code RA15Z).60 In comparison, a bone turnover marker assay can cost approximately £20 to £25; this
includes administration and clinical interpretation costs as well as the cost of the reagents. P1NP had been
reported as costing between £25 and £83 in 2007.61
Summary
Bone turnover markers may be useful in monitoring the response of bone turnover to treatment regimens
in patients with osteoporosis, and hence to identify patients who are non-responders. This in turn will
allow changes in management or treatment strategies to be implemented in a timely manner to ensure
maximum benefit to the patient. An evidence synthesis using systematic review methodology will be used
to investigate potential uses of bone turnover markers and a decision-analytic model will be developed,
if sufficient evidence is found, to establish clinical effectiveness.
BACKGROUND

Chapter 2 Definition of decision problem
Decision problem
In relation to the use of bone turnover markers for the monitoring of patients receiving osteoporosis
treatments, the decision problem in clinical practice is: ‘What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of
monitoring regimens that include at least one bone turnover marker, over and above monitoring regimens
where a bone turnover marker is not used, and which, if any, bone turnover marker should be introduced
into routine practice for the monitoring of response to osteoporosis treatments?’
Overall aims and objectives of the assessment
The primary aims of the systematic review are to determine the clinical effectiveness, test accuracy, test
reliability, test reproducibility and cost-effectiveness of bone turner markers in people being treated with
any of bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, denosumab or teriparatide for osteoporosis.
The review of the clinical evidence will focus on three key clinical areas:
l Clinical effectiveness: how does bone turnover marker monitoring impact on the decision-making
process and patient outcomes?
l Test accuracy: how well do changes in the level of bone turnover markers associate with changes in
bone density, architecture and incidence of fracture?
l Test reliability and reproducibility: how much do the results of tests vary within and between patients?
If possible (i.e. if clinical effectiveness can be established) a decision model will be developed to determine
the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for monitoring treatment response and making changes in
patient management, addressing the question: ‘Which monitoring regimen is the most cost-effective for
informing treatment decisions?’ The treatments considered in the model will be those considered in the
clinical review and no treatment. If a decision model is produced, expected value of perfect information
(EVPI) analyses can be conducted and will be used to determine the need for further research, identify the
research questions critical to decision-making, and help inform the design of future studies.

Chapter 3 Assessment of the clinical effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness evidence
Methods for reviewing the evidence
The review was conducted systematically following the general principles recommended in the Centre for
Reviews and Dissemination’s guidance for undertaking reviews in health care62 and the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.63–65
Identification of studies
The screening of titles and abstracts was conducted by two independent reviewers. All potentially relevant
studies were retrieved where available, and two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to the
full papers. Disagreements were resolved by team discussion. Where consensus could not be reached at
the title and abstract stage, the full paper was ordered. Inclusion was not restricted by language or date of
publication. Abstracts were included if no additional information was available and there were sufficient
outcome data to extract.
Search strategy
The aim of the literature searches was to systematically identify studies on the effectiveness, test accuracy,
test reliability, test reproducibility and cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers in people being treated
for osteoporosis. Search terms were identified by scanning key papers identified at the beginning of the
project, through discussion with the review team and through the use of database thesauri. The creation
of the search strategy was an iterative process originally using the MEDLINE database and then adapted as
appropriate to the other sources searched.
The base search strategy included the following components:
1. bone turnover marker terms
AND
2. osteoporosis terms
AND
3. intervention terms.
Sources of information were identified by an information specialist with input from the project team.
The following databases were searched without language or date restrictions to identify primary studies,
relevant reviews and economic studies:
l Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (via EBSCOhost 1982 to
4 March 2012)
l The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 of 12 February 2012), which includes:

l ControlledTrials.com (via website at http://controlled-trials.com to March 2012)
l Paid Clinical Trials (via website at www.paidclinicaltrials.org to May 2012).
Other sources
The reference lists of included papers and relevant reviews were assessed for additional relevant studies.
Where necessary, authors of eligible studies were contacted for further information and experts in the field
were contacted to see if they had access to further material. We also hand-searched (in May 2012) the
contents pages for the previous 12 months of three relevant journals that were the source of a large
proportion of identified studies (Osteoporosis International, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research and
Bone) as these recent issues may be poorly indexed in the electronic databases.
The websites of the following organisations were also searched in May 2012 for information on relevant
trials and other research:
l Eli Lilly and Company: www.lilly.com/
l GlaxoSmithKline: www.gsk.com/
l Novartis: www.novartis.com/
l Nycomed: www.nycomed.com/
l Procter & Gamble: www.pg.com/
l US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): www.fda.gov/
¢ FDA website search included specific searches of:
¢ Office for Women’s Health (OWH): Research Science Program Awards: osteoporosis section
¢ Publications based on OWH projects: osteoporosis section
¢ Medical devices section.
The total number of records found after deduplication was 4002. Records were managed within an
EndNote library (EndNote version X3, Thomson Reuters, CA, USA). The full search strategies for each
database searched are provided in Appendix 1.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Index tests being evaluated
The review evaluated four bone turnover marker tests, two serum bone formation markers (sP1NP and
sBALP), and two bone resorption markers that can be measured in either the serum or urine (s/uCTX
and s/uNTX).

Population
Studies eligible for inclusion were those in adults (> 18 years of age) either:
l receiving any of bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, denosumab or teriparatide for the
secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures, regardless of the baseline pathology; or
l in any high-risk group being treated with any of bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate,
denosumab or teriparatide for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
Study designs
Effectiveness
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any size, where patients are randomised to a standard monitoring
regimen (with or without DXA) or to a standard monitoring regimen with additional bone turnover marker
monitoring. Studies reporting the impact of bone turnover marker test results on the decision-making
process for management of osteoporosis, that also reported the subsequent rate of fracture in the
population being assessed, were also sought (‘Decision studies’). Studies assessing the effectiveness of
treatments for osteoporosis using changes in bone turnover markers solely as an outcome were excluded.
Test accuracy
Studies comparing the results of bone turnover marker tests with the results of bone biopsy or a composite
reference standard of DXA and subsequent fracture outcome were included. Given the nature of the review
question, we believe it unlikely that such studies would be available, so in addition we included prospective
studies that measured the association between bone turnover and bone density, biopsy results and/or fracture
rates, and that reported a correlation coefficient for this association. Prospective studies that evaluated changes
in bone turnover markers in patients receiving one of the specified osteoporosis treatments, that provided
sufficient data to produce a measure of the risk of fracture, or that reported the results of multivariate regression
analyses in which a bone turnover marker of interest is an independent variable, were also eligible for inclusion.
Prognostic studies using a bone turnover marker to identify patients at risk of osteoporosis and fracture at
baseline, prior to commencing treatment, were excluded, as were studies that included fewer than 20 patients,
meeting the population inclusion criteria, in analyses of outcomes applicable to this review.
Reliability and reproducibility
Prospective controlled studies of serial bone turnover marker measurements that reported a measure of
within- and/or between-patient variability in patients receiving a treatment being evaluated in this review were
included. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included at least 20 patients in at least one analysis of interest.
Economic evaluation
Full economic evaluations meeting the population and intervention inclusion criteria. A full economic
evaluation was defined as any study in which a comparison of two or more relevant alternatives was
undertaken with costs and outcomes examined separately for each alternative.
Outcomes
Effectiveness
Randomised controlled trials and decision studies reporting either change in patient management
strategies, the incidence of fracture and/or treatment adherence rates were included.
Test accuracy
Studies had to report either:
l estimates of diagnostic accuracy, or sufficient data for these to be calculated
l a correlation coefficient, or sufficient data for this to be calculated, for the association between a bone
turnover marker and bone density and/or the incidence of fracture

l the risk/incidence of fracture associated with the bone turnover marker test results
l at least a p-value for a bone turnover marker of interest that is used as an independent variable in a
multivariate regression.
Reliability and reproducibility
Studies reporting a measure for intra- and/or interpatient variability in bone turnover marker test results
were included.
Economic evaluation
Study inclusion was not restricted by outcome.
Data extraction strategy
Clinical data extraction was conducted by one reviewer using a standardised data extraction form and
checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third
reviewer when necessary. Attempts were made to contact authors for missing data. Data from multiple
publications of the same study were extracted and reported as a single study. Where applicable and
available, extraction included data on study details (e.g. study/EndNote identifier, author, year, country,
setting, number of participants and duration of follow-up), patient characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
duration of osteoporosis, risk group, concomitant renal/liver disease; baseline bone turnover marker levels
and BMD), details of intervention (serum or urine; sample collection details; pre-sampling preparations/
restrictions; sample storage details; assay used; adjustments for creatinine excretion for urinary markers;
delay between sample collection and assay; single/serial measures; intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation; value for least significant change), study quality, and reported outcomes as specified above.
Economic data extraction was planned on the comparators, study population, main analytic approaches
(e.g. patient-level analysis/decision-analytic modelling), primary outcome specified for the economic
analysis, details of adjustment for QoL, direct costs (medical and non-medical) and productivity costs,
estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness and approaches to quantifying decision uncertainty
(e.g. deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analysis).
Critical appraisal strategy
The quality of the individual studies was assessed at the study level by one reviewer and independently
checked by a second; disagreements were resolved by consensus. The quality of included studies was
assessed using relevant criteria suitable for the study design selected from standard checklists for RCTs,
observational studies and economic evalutaions;62,66–68 topic-specific quality issues were incorporated
where necessary (see Appendix 2 for details and guidance for completion).
Methods of data synthesis
Key study characteristics, patient outcomes and study quality were summarised in a narrative and tables.
Meta-analyses suitable to the clinical data extracted were planned to estimate a summary measure of effect
when sufficient numbers of comparable studies were available for an outcome. Given the substantial
heterogeneity across the studies, this was not possible. It was also not possible to investigate the potential
sources of heterogeneity that were specified in the protocol, as insufficient numbers of studies similar in other
population, intervention and methodological characteristics were identified. The analyses planned were:
l investigation of potential subgroups of interest where sufficient data are available; for example, post￾menopausal women (overall and for specific age ranges if data are available), elderly, skeletal site (hip,
spine or wrist), and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
l sensitivity analyses conducted, where appropriate, to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity
such as study quality, and differences in sample acquisition, storage and assay methods.
A narrative synthesis of the methods and results of the cost-effectiveness studies was planned.

As a result of the electronic and hand searching, 4002 papers were identified for initial screening.
Of these, 437 were retrieved as full papers; 35 were reviews that underwent screening of their
bibliographies.5,6,11,15,34,47,50,69–96 Sixteen of the full papers were published in languages other than
English.37,52,74,76,79,81,95,97–105 Nineteen studies had duplicate publications; where this was the
case14,40,42,43,56,103,104,106–144 one paper was allocated as the primary publication (full paper if the duplicate
was an abstract or letter; the published paper if the duplicate comprised data from the manufacturer’s
online trials database, the most recent publication, or the paper published in English) and used as the
citation for the study throughout the review;14,40,42,43,56,106,131–140,142,143 relevant data were extracted from all
publications where applicable. After full-paper screening, 42 studies (across 70 publications) met the
inclusion criteria for the review of clinical effectiveness; the flow of studies through the review is given in
Figure 1 (some of the studies were excluded for more than one reason). A list of excluded studies with the
reasons for exclusion is given in Appendix 3.
The majority of the studies were conducted primarily, or entirely, in post-menopausal women; only four

Quantity and quality of the included randomised controlled trials
Of the 42 included studies, five were RCTs.56,133,143,148,149 Of these, one reported using an adequate method
for randomisation and allocation concealment;56 the methods were not reported for the other four
RCTs.133,143,148,149 As a result, the appropriateness of the control group in the four RCTs was also deemed to
be unclear; however, given the limited information available, it is unlikely that the control group was not
selected from the same population as the intervention group. Only one RCT recruited a representative
osteoporotic patient population;148 the others were conducted in a selected subgroup of post-menopausal
women, restricted either by ethnicity133,143 or by age.56,149 Baseline comparability could be assessed in only
two trials; groups were comparable.56,133 Although blinding of patients and care givers is not feasible for
these types of interventions, blinding of outcome assessors is; none of the RCTs reported blinding outcome
assessors.56,133,143,148,149 Descriptions of the intervention details were considered adequate to allow replication
in two RCTs.148,149 None of the five RCTs reported the characteristics of the patients lost to follow￾up,56,133,143,148,149 and only three reported reasons for the losses.56,133,148 Three of the five reported using an
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,143,148,149 one used ITT for some analyses,133 and one reported excluding
patients who were randomised but did not return electronic monitors from the ITT population.56 The
imputation methods used for missing data were not reported for any of the RCTs.56,133,143,148,149 Four of the
RCTs had a period of follow-up less than the 1 year considered by the authors of this review to be the
minimum duration required to identify changes in treatment strategies and subsequent fracture
risk;56,133,143,148 however, none of the RCTs assessed either of these outcomes. Given the limitations of the
included RCTs, all were considered to be at a high or uncertain risk of bias, and therefore of low quality. The
full results of the quality assessment and the guidance used for its completion are given in Appendix 2.
Quantity and quality of the included non-randomised studies
Of the 37 non-randomised studies, 21 were cohorts derived from the treatment arms of RCTs that
compared a treatment regimen with either placebo or an alternative treatment.14,40–43,132,137,139,140,146,147,
151–153,156,159,161–165 The cohorts were derived either directly from reports of the RCT42,43,132,139,140,147,151–153,
156,159,161 or from a paper reporting a post hoc analysis of the RCT40,146,162–164 or from a post hoc analysis of
a subgroup of patients from the RCT.14,41,137,165 These derived cohorts were assessed for quality as cohort
studies rather than RCTs, as this is the manner in which they were used in the review.
The remaining 16 studies were 14 uncontrolled cohort studies58,99,106,131,135,136,142,145,150,154,155,157,158,160 and two
controlled cohort studies; one compared two groups with different prior treatment regimens,38 and the
other treated one group of women with HRT and the other with alendronate, although the groups seem to
have been established after recruitment.44 Single cohorts were derived from both controlled cohort studies.
In the only truly controlled cohort study, the recruitment of the control group was considered appropriate
and the groups comparable at baseline.38 Of the 16 studies that were designed as cohort studies, only four
appeared to use consecutive recruitment (though this was usually inferred, not explicitly stated),38,142,154,160
one was not consecutive,136 and recruitment was unclear in 11.44,58,99,106,131,135,145,150,155,157,158
Across the 37 non-randomised studies, 16 recruited a representative population,38,40,58,99,131,132,137,140,151,155,
157,158,160,163–165 17 did not,14,41–44,106,136,139,142,146,152–154,156,159,161,162 and in the remaining four, it was unclear
whether or not the population was representative.135,145,147,150 Only nine studies provided sufficient
intervention details to allow repetition.38,41,58,153,155,157,158,160,163 Ten studies had no loss to follow-up for the
analyses they conducted (some were post hoc analyses of the specific group of patients with the required
outcome measures).41,44,58,106,137,154,157,159,164,165 The controlled cohort study used a ‘modified’ ITT analysis;
seven patients were excluded from the ITT population, and last observation carried forward was used for
the imputation of missing data for those in the modified ITT population.38 The reasons were given for
losses to follow-up in a further 11 studies.14,42,131,136,139,142,146,153,156,158,160

Confounders were clearly identified and described in five studies.137,151,154,155,161 Although six studies
adjusted for confounding factors in multiple regression analyses,137,139,151,155,161,163 only two adjusted for all
the confounders considered important by the review authors (age, gender, prior fracture, baseline BMD,
and BMI).151,155 Twenty-seven of the studies had a minimum of 1-year follow-up in all patients.14,38,41,42,44,58,
99,106,131,132,135–137,139,142,145,150–152,155,157–161,163,165 The assessment of the reporting of adverse events of bone
turnover markers was not assessed for these studies as their focus was not the assessment of the
effectiveness or safety of bone turnover markers. A summary of the results of the quality assessment is
given in Figure 2.
Given the limitations of the non-randomised studies included, all were considered to be at a high
or unclear risk of bias, and therefore the overall quality of each of the studies was considered to be low.
The low quality assigned to the cohorts derived from RCTs is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of
the original RCT; this classification was primarily driven by the post hoc nature of the selection of patients
in the paper reporting the outcomes of interest for this review, which can introduce bias. The full results of
the quality assessment and the guidance used for its completion, including the criteria on which the overall
quality was primarily based upon, are given in Appendix 2.

Assessment of clinical effectiveness
Five RCTs56,133,143,148,149 and one post hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients41 from a previous RCT166
evaluated the effectiveness of feedback of bone turnover marker results on QoL and/or adherence,
compliance, or persistence in post-menopausal women. These terms were defined variably across the
studies, particularly the proportion of medication taken which was the definition used across the studies
for adherence, compliance and persistence. We decided to standardise the definitions by adopting the
system used by Delmas et al.:
56 persistence is the time until discontinuation of medication, compliance is
the proportion of medication taken, and adherence is a combination of persistence and compliance. None
of the RCTs reported on the impact of bone turnover marker monitoring on treatment management.
Adherence
One study reported on adherence and found a significantly greater average daily proportion of patients
who were persistent and compliant to 5 mg/day risedronate in those receiving feedback after the first
reinforcement visit at 13 weeks (p = 0.01).56 The decrease in adherence observed over time was attributed
to the increasing number of patients who did not persist with treatment.
Compliance
Five studies reported on compliance (Table 2).41,133,143,148,149 The rate of compliance with bisphosphonate
therapy, even in the no-feedback arms of the trials, was very high and unlikely to be representative of
clinical practice. Therefore, with such a high rate of baseline compliance, the capacity for feedback of bone
turnover marker results to impact on the compliance is limited and there seems to be little difference
between the feedback and no-feedback arms of the trials. Where odds ratios (ORs) could be calculated,
there was no significant difference between the feedback and no-feedback arms; this could not be
calculated for most of the studies owing to insufficient data (see Table 2).
Persistence
One study reported 77% of patients persisting with 5 mg/day risedronate in those receiving feedback of
uNTX results, and 80% in those that were not; this was a high baseline rate that may not be
representative of clinical practice.56 When adjusted for compliance, there was no significant impact of
uNTX on persistence in the no-feedback arm (p = 0.71); feedback of uNTX results significantly affected
persistence in the feedback group (p = 0.0029). Overall, there was a significant impact of feedback of
uNTX results on discontinuation (p = 0.017); where the message given to the patient was a good uNTX
response (> 30% decrease), the hazard ratio (HR) for discontinuation was 0.71 [95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.53 to 0.95]. Where the message given was a poor uNTX response, the HR for discontinuation was
2.22 (95% CI 1.27 to 3.89). Where the message given was that uNTX was stable, there was no significant
difference in discontinuation between those receiving feedback and those who were not.56
Quality of life
Two studies reported the results of the Osteoporosis Patient Perception Survey (OPPS) QoL questionnaire.133,148
One reported statistically significant differences of at least 3.8% favouring feedback for all domains and the
composite score (p ≤ 0.021) in women aged between 55 and 85 years, with the exception of the motivation
domain (p > 0.05).148 The mean scores reported in the second study are given in Table 3; there were
significant increases in feeling informed, satisfaction and the overall composite score.133 Although statistically
significant, it is unclear whether or not the small absolute changes are clinically significant.

Assessment of test accuracy
Most of the evidence available evaluating the accuracy of bone turnover markers was in the form of
correlations between changes in bone turnover marker levels and BMD measured using DXA. The studies
were extremely heterogeneous precluding the use of any meta-analytical models; the data were therefore
presented in tables for each type of treatment (bisphosphonates, teriparatide, raloxifene, strontium
ranelate and denosumab) with a brief narrative. Even if the data were not heterogeneous, the usefulness
of these correlation data to inform the accuracy of bone turnover marker tests for identifying patients who
remain at risk of fracture is limited; this is discussed in more detail in Limitations of the available evidence.
Twenty-seven studies reported the results of correlation analyses,14,38,40,42–44,58,106,131,135,136,140,145,146,150,
152–155,157–163,165 eight reported the results of multiple regression analyses,132,137,139,151,153,155,161,163 and four
reported both.153,155,161,163 The r-values reported were derived using Pearson’s correlation in seven
studies44,58,152,157,160,162,163 and Spearman’s rank correlation in 11;14,43,106,135,140,146,153,158,159,161,165 the method
was not reported in nine studies.38,40,42,131,136,145,150,154,155 Five studies reported predictive accuracy results
in terms of sensitivity,140,156 results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses,140,156,159,161 or
reported sufficient data to produce 2 × 2 tables of test performance.163 One uncontrolled cohort study
reported the difference in bone turnover marker measurements between those with and without a
fracture,142 and another between those who did and did not have a response in BMD to treatment.162
Bisphosphonates
Eighteen studies treated patients using bisphosphonates.14,40,44,58,131,136,137,139,142,145,153–158,163,165 The variables
that have been correlated, the time points at which they were measured and the patient population
receiving treatment are given in Table 4 for each bisphosphonate, along with the results of the correlation
analyses. As can be seen from the table, no two studies assessed the same combination of variables and
patient population, either within each drug or across bisphosphonates as a whole. Of the 54 r-values
reported for correlations between changes in bone turnover marker and BMD, 19 were statistically
significant (p < 0.05); however, all of the correlations were weak (r < 0.5). There were insufficient data for
any combination of bone turnover marker, DXA site, time points at which tests were conducted, and
patient population to identify any patterns in the data. One study reported correlations between changes in
bone turnover markers and fracture incidence; there was a significant treatment by time interaction after
the third administration of intravenous zoledronate with sCTX, but no significant association with sP1NP.40
Limited data from studies conducting multiple regression analyses indicated that there may be a significant
association between the changes in bone turnover markers and either BMD or the incidence of hip or
vertebral fractures (Table 5). However, although the studies adjusted for confounding factors, only one
adjusted for all of the confounders considered important by the review authors.155 Predictive ability was
assessed using alternative methods in some studies (Table 6); these data provided little evidence regarding
the predictive ability of the tests being evaluated.

Overall, the type of data and quality of the evidence base are insufficient to draw any strong
conclusion regarding the predictive accuracy of bone turnover marker tests in a population being treated
with bisphosphonates.
Teriparatide
Ten studies treated patients using teriparatide.14,38,42,106,140,146,150,152,159,162 Seven studies administered
20 µg/day (Table 7),14,38,42,140,146,150,162 two administered 40 µg/day (Table 8),140,159 two reported results for a
combined population that received either 20 or 40 µg/day,140,152 and one study did not report the dose
administered (Table 9).106
Of the nine studies that reported the results of correlation analyses, the r-values reported were derived
using Pearson’s correlation in one study152 and Spearman’s rank correlation in seven;14,38,42,106,140,146,159 the
method was not reported in one study.150 Across 71 reported r-values for correlations between changes in
bone turnover and BMD in patients treated with 20 µg/day teriparatide, 22 were statistically significant
(see Table 7); however, all of them were weak (r < 0.5). In patients being treated with 40 µg/day, 9 of
21 reported r-values indicated statistically significant, but weak, correlations (see Table 8). When data for
patients receiving 20 and 40 µg/day were combined, 12 of 20 reported r-values were statistically significant
(see Table 9), but, again, all correlations were weak. One of these studies analysed data for the 20 µg/day
and 40 µg/day arms separately and combined;140 the results for the patients receiving 40 µg/day teriparatide
were similar to those of the combined arm, whereas the correlations between changes in bone turnover
and BMD in those receiving 20 µg/day were much smaller.140 The study that did not report the dose of
teriparatide used reported a single non-significant r-value (see Table 9).106 As with the results for those
treated with bisphosphonates, no two studies assessed the same combination of variables and patient
population, and there were insufficient data for each combination of bone turnover marker, DXA site, time
points at which the tests were conducted, and patient population to identify any patterns in the data.
One study reported correlations between changes in bone turnover markers and dynamic bone parameters
determined by bone biopsy in patients receiving 20 µg/day (see Table 7).150 This study suggests that sCTX
and sP1NP may be positively correlated with improvements in dynamic bone parameters measured after
24 months of treatment, particularly when the bone turnover marker was also measured at 24 months
(no results were presented for the associations with 3, 6 and 12 months’ bone turnover marker tests;
however, the study was reported as an abstract and there was no response from the study authors to a
request for further information); moderate to strong correlations were observed between the 24-month
change in sCTX and sP1NP and the 24-month change in activation frequency (r = 0.69 and r = 0.73,
respectively).150 A second study reported correlations between changes in bone turnover markers and bone
structural and dynamic parameters for a population that combined patients receiving 20 or 40 µg/day
(see Table 9).152 This study reported significant correlations between the changes in sBALP conducted at
1 month and some structural parameters, with a strong correlation between the change in sBALP and
mean wall thickness (r = 0.73); there were no significant correlations with dynamic parameters. There were
no significant correlations between structural or dynamic parameters and uNTX.152 It is possible that
significant correlations could have been detected if the bone turnover marker test had been delayed
beyond 1 month, as demonstrated in the first study,150 or if the analyses included a greater number of
patients. In addition, as demonstrated by Chen et al.,
140 the strength of the correlation will be affected by
the combining of data for 20 and 40 µg/day, particularly in such a small study.

NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

No studies were identified that reported the results of multiple regression analyses in patients being
treated with teriparatide. Predictive ability was assessed using alternative methods in some studies
(Table 10); these data provide little evidence regarding the predictive ability of the tests being evaluated.
Overall, the quality of the evidence base is insufficient to draw any strong conclusion regarding the
predictive accuracy of bone turnover marker tests in a population being treated with teriparatide. Further,
the lack of evidence of a correlation between changes in bone turnover markers and BMD does not
indicate a lack of association between changes of bone turnover and fracture risk.
Raloxifene
Three studies treated patients using raloxifene.132,151,160 Of the 12 reported r-values, none was statistically
significant and all correlations were weak (Table 11). There is some evidence that changes in sBALP may be
associated with the incidence of fracture (Table 12); however, this was assessed in a single study that did
not distinguish between women receiving 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day of raloxifene;151 it is unclear whether
or not the significant association seen in this study of raloxifene for the combined dose would be evident
with both doses if analyses had been conducted separately for each dose. The evidence base is insufficient
to draw conclusions regarding the predictive accuracy of bone turnover marker tests in a population being
treated with raloxifene.
Strontium ranelate
Two studies evaluated patients treated using strontium ranelate.135,161 Of the seven reported r-values, six
were statistically significant (Table 13); sP1NP and sCTX showed moderate correlations with absolute
changes in BMD (r = 0.615 and 0.56, respectively). A single study reported the results of a multiple
regression analysis and correlation (Table 14). Although the correlation between changes in sBALP and
changes in BMD at the femoral neck were found to be weak and non-significant, when evaluated in the
multiple regression analysis on a percentage change basis a significant association was evident; several
explanatory variables were included in the multiple regression analysis. The opposite was true of sCTX,
where significant but weak correlations were not evident in the subsequent multiple regression analysis.161
Predictive ability was assessed using area under the curve (AUC) in one study (Table 15);161 these data
provide little evidence regarding the predictive ability of the tests being evaluated. Overall, the evidence
base is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the predictive accuracy of bone turnover marker tests in
a population being treated with strontium ranelate.

Denosumab
One study treated patients using denosumab.43 Of the six reported r-values, five were statistically
significant (Table 16); all correlations were weak (r < 0.50). No studies were identified that reported the
results of multiple regression analyses or results from any alternative methods of analysis. There is
insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding the predictive accuracy of bone turnover marker
tests in a population being treated with denosumab.
Assessment of test reliability and reproducibility
Four studies reported S/N ratio for a bone turnover marker in those being treated with either etidronate,156
teriparatide42 or raloxifene.147,164 Each study calculated the S/N ratio differently, making comparisons across
studies difficult (Table 17). Within-study comparisons show that sP1NP at 2 weeks had a lower S/N ratio
than sCTX at 2 weeks but a higher S/N ratio at 25 weeks,147 and sP1NP had a greater S/N ratio than sBALP
when measured at 6 months.42 Blumsohn et al.42 reported the intraclass correlation coefficients measured
at two time points between 3 and 14 days apart, which were 0.988 for sBALP and 0.983 for sP1NP.

Results of the systematic review of cost-effectiveness
No studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review of bone turnover marker monitoring
strategies. A list of excluded studies with the reasons for exclusion is given in Appendix 3.
Discussion
This systematic review set out to (1) determine the clinical effectiveness of monitoring regimens that
included at least one bone turnover marker, over and above monitoring regimens where a bone turnover
marker was not used, and (2) identify which bone turnover marker, if any, should be introduced into
routine practice for the monitoring of response to osteoporosis treatments with the aim of identifying

non-responders to treatment and informing treatment choice. In order to address these questions we
sought a range of study designs. No studies were identified that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of bone
turnover marker monitoring strategies, and therefore the focus of this discussion is the clinical
effectiveness evidence.
Randomised controlled trials were included if they compared monitoring with or without a bone turnover
marker, the feedback of results of bone turnover tests, or monitoring with different bone turnover
markers. We also searched for evidence on the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of these tests in
people with osteoporosis receiving treatment. There are a large number of RCTs that compare different
treatment regimens, using bone turnover markers as an outcome to determine treatment response; we
excluded these trials. Although such trials of treatment effectiveness indicate the magnitude of change in a
bone turnover marker in response to treatment and potentially identify treatment non-responders, without
a direct analysis of the association of the change in the bone turnover marker with a measure of fracture
risk (such as BMD, incidence of fracture or biopsy), there is no evidence that that the bone turnover
markers have accurately identified non-responders. We therefore restricted our review of test accuracy to
those studies that presented an analysis that directly compared the results of bone turnover markers with a
measure of fracture risk.
The review identified a number of studies that used a range of methods to evaluate the clinical
effectiveness and predictive value of bone turnover marker tests. Unfortunately, no studies meeting the
inclusion criteria investigated the impact of bone turnover marker monitoring on patient management and
treatment choices.
Key findings
The included RCTs evaluated the impact of the feedback of results of bone turnover marker tests on QoL
and/or adherence, compliance and/or persistence with bisphosphonate therapy. Although this is an
important area of research, the usefulness of these data is limited because of the treatment regimens
administered and the high baseline compliance and persistence rates; these issues are discussed further in
Limitations of the available evidence, below. There was some evidence that the feedback of bone turnover
marker results, and the message given, impacted on persistence with treatment; a positive result seems to
encourage persistence and a negative result to discourage it.56 This may not be the response expected to
the feedback of such results in clinical practice. It may be expected that a message that treatment was not
working could encourage adherence rather than discourage it, assuming that the potential risk of fracture
is highlighted to the patient. It is worth noting that the RCT evaluating this, firstly, was conducted in older
women aged 65–80 years, and may not be reflective of the response of younger post-menopausal women
or of those with secondary osteoporosis, and, secondly, used daily risedronate which is a regimen that is
not commonly used in current clinical practice.
Two of the included RCTs also reported on the QoL using the OPPS questionnaire; these studies reported
small improvements for those patients receiving feedback in the overall, feeling informed and satisfaction
scores133,148 and the confidence score,148 compared with those who did not receive feedback. Although
this is based on only two studies, one received questionnaires from 563 of the 596 participants recruited,
and the other study recruited 585 participants although it was not clear how many of these returned
questionnaires. A study identified during the scoping review of modelling methods explored the impact of
monitoring antiresorptive treatments using a bone turnover marker on quality-adjusted life-years
(QALYs).167 The decision tree (up to 3 months) and Markov model (3 months to 5 years) was based on a
60-year-old woman with post-menopausal osteoporosis with a total hip T-score of –3, no concurrent
disease, and second-generation bisphosphonate therapy for 5 years. The comparators were no monitoring
beyond a simple short-term follow-up to rule out adverse reactions, and monitoring with a serum bone
resorption marker after 3 months of treatment. This modelling study showed small improvements in
QALYs when adherence to treatment was assumed to be the same in both monitoring strategies, with the
improvement being greater if monitoring improved adherence.167

The majority of the evidence for the review of clinical effectiveness was based around the predictive
accuracy of bone turnover marker tests in the form of correlations with changes in BMD; the limitations of
these data are discussed in Limitations of the available evidence, below. Given the extreme heterogeneity
across the studies, it was impossible to determine trends for any particular treatment–bone turnover marker
monitoring combination. Studies correlating changes in bone turnover with either biopsy results or fracture
outcomes were uncommon, with two studies using biopsy results as the comparator150,152 and seven using
fracture.40,42,132,137,139,151,161 The use of biopsy in all patients in a study is unlikely to be considered ethical
because of the invasive nature of the procedure and the risk of complications. In addition, there are several
limitations to the use of fracture outcomes as the comparator: the outcome is relatively rare, resulting in the
need for larger studies; there needs to be a longer duration of follow-up in order to detect the outcome;
and attrition is likely to be a problem over the time period required. These limitations may be the reason
that DXA is most commonly used for the comparator. Data from the studies that used either biopsy or
fracture were heterogeneous in terms of patient population and treatment regimen, and method of data
analysis. The results of these studies were inconsistent and there were insufficient data to determine trends
for any particular treatment–bone turnover marker monitoring combination.
There was no evidence available to inform the question as to the clinical effectiveness of treatment
monitoring including a bone turnover marker over and above monitoring regimens where a bone turnover
marker was not used. Further, the evidence available relating to the predictive accuracy, reliability and
reproducibility was heterogeneous and of low quality, precluding the ability to draw any conclusions
regarding the choice of bone turnover marker for use in monitoring in routine clinical practice.
Strengths and limitations of the review
The systematic review was based on an extensive search with well-designed search strategies. Abstracts
were included when there were sufficient data to be extracted; authors of all potentially included abstracts
were contacted in an attempt to identify full publications and/or obtain unpublished data. In addition, no
study was excluded based on date of conduct or language of publication. Studies were selected using
inclusion criteria defined a priori. We included RCTs of any size in the review of the clinical effectiveness of
bone turnover marker monitoring. However, given (1) the large number of non-randomised studies and
randomised studies from which cohorts were derived, from which data on test accuracy, reliability and
reproducibility could have been extracted, (2) the apparent poor quality of this evidence base, and (3) the
time constraints on the project, an additional criterion not specified in the protocol was applied. We
excluded non-randomised studies and derived cohorts that included fewer than 20 osteoporotic patients,
receiving one of the treatments of interest, in all the analyses of outcomes relevant to this review.
This cut-off was used to distinguish between a case series and a cohort study, excluding from the review
the lowest levels of evidence. This is the only change made to the protocol. Although the studies were too
heterogeneous to pool using statistical meta-analytical models, we conducted a narrative synthesis in an
attempt to summarise the evidence available.
Limitations of the available evidence
As with all systematic reviews, the reliability and generalisability of the results are governed by the
quality and quantity of the evidence available. Although we included 42 studies, all were considered to be
at a high or unclear risk of bias, and therefore of low quality. Furthermore, no RCTs were identified that
addressed one of the primary aims of the review: to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of monitoring
regimens that included at least one bone turnover marker, over and above monitoring regimens
where a bone turnover marker was not used. Where RCTs were conducted, these reported primarily
on compliance.56,133,143,148,149
Adherence to treatment (in terms of both compliance and persistence), particularly with oral
bisphosphonates, is a considerable problem in the management of patients with osteoporosis.32,168–171
Oral bisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal adverse events,15,32,49–51,172 and require adherence
to specific instructions for administration to maximise absorption and bioavailability that many patients find
inconvenient.15,32,53 Non-adherence to treatment regimens will result in a non- (or inadequate) response to

treatment and a continued higher risk of fracture.173,174 A recent systematic review of 27 observational
studies, most of which were retrospective database analyses, reported a rate of fracture ranging from 6%
to 38% in patients who were non-compliant, and 5% to 19% in patients who were non-persistent with
osteoporosis medications.175 The meta-analysis conducted included 12 of the studies and indicated a
statistically significant increased risk of fracture of approximately 30% in patients who were non-compliant
(OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.38), and 30% to 40% in patients who were non-persistent (OR 1.40, 95% CI
1.29 to 1.52) with treatment.175 Most of the patients in the review received bisphosphonates; however,
raloxifene, strontium ranelate, calcitonin, HRT, vitamin D and calcium were included in the
regimens administered.175
In the five RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review,56,133,143,148,149 a very high proportion of
patients were adherent to medication; this is unlikely to be representative of clinical practice. Why there
was such a high rate of compliance in the trials is unclear. It could be due to the use of a once-monthly
dosing regimen used in most of the trials rather than daily or weekly dosing, as less frequent dosing is
generally preferred by patients and can result in increased adherence.32,173,176 Other potential reasons are:
the short duration of follow-up used in most of the studies; that patients giving consent to be part of the
trial are more likely to be compliant; and/or the increased attention and resulting patient awareness that
being part of a trial may result in. It is, therefore, unclear how the feedback of bone turnover marker
results would impact on the population seen in generally clinical practice, which is likely to be less
compliant and/or persistent.
Most of the evidence available relating to the accuracy of the bone turnover markers was in the form of
correlations with BMD, measured using DXA. Some of the correlations, but not all, were statistically
significant. The fact that a correlation coefficient is statistically significant is not indicative of a strong
association between the two variables. The likelihood of the results of a correlation analysis achieving
statistical significance is influenced by study sample size; small samples are unlikely to have sufficient
power to detect statistically significant results. Indeed, the results showed non-significant but strong
correlations in small studies, and significant but weak correlations in larger studies; the majority of the
studies where a strong correlation was detected were small, thus lacking the power to detect significant
results. Although pooling these studies to derive a summary estimate could be a solution to increase the
statistical power, the high level of clinical heterogeneity across the studies precluded the use of meta￾analytical techniques. In addition, a non-significant result reflects only that there is no linear association
(which is what the correlation coefficient evaluates) and not that there is no association at all.
These correlation data may be further limited in their usefulness, as BMD is only one factor that impacts on
bone strength and therefore on fracture risk,177 and the association between bone turnover markers and
BMD may vary depending on the population and on the menopausal status in women.70 There are three
factors that determine bone strength: density, architecture and porosity,177 and therefore increases in BMD
explain only a limited proportion of the reduction in fracture risk.91,178 Bone turnover impacts on all the
three aspects of bone strength,177 and so unlike BMD, biomarkers used to measure bone turnover reflect
changes in overall bone strength, and hence potentially fracture risk.91,177 It has been suggested that it is
reductions in activation frequencies and reductions in bone turnover resulting in thickening of critical
trabeculae, reductions in perforation of trabecular plates and promotion of bone mineralisation, rather
than increases in BMD, that reduce a patient’s risk of fracture with antiresorptive therapy.48,179 In studies of
raloxifene, risedronate, alendronate and zoledronic acid, bone turnover markers reportedly explained
between 28% and 77% of the fracture risk reduction, compared with changes in BMD explaining up to
28% with the same agents.47 Therefore, even if there is no significant correlation between changes in
bone turnover markers and increases in BMD, it cannot be assumed that there is no correlation with
fracture risk. BMD is a poor surrogate on which to assess the accuracy of bone turnover markers, and any
presumption that bone turnover markers are not effective in identifying patients who are not responsive to
treatment and still at risk of fracture based on these data would be unwise.70,177,178

The lack of value of the correlation data was compounded by the extreme heterogeneity across the
studies in terms of patient populations, the definitions used to diagnose osteoporosis, treatment regimens,
bone turnover marker tests used and their timing, and the DXA sites used and the timing of DXA scans;
no two studies reported the results for the same combination of these factors, precluding the use of any
meta-analytical models. In addition, where reported, there was heterogeneity across studies in terms of
obtaining and handling of samples. For the studies evaluating serum bone turnover markers, patients were
not fasted in one study using sBALP,142 storage temperature ranged from –20 °C140,157,158,160 to –80 °C,58,163
and the assay method used also varied (most noticeably for sBALP, which was measured using

IRMA,14,132,139,140,151,152,157,161,164 or an ostase assay where the variant was not reported146). For studies
evaluating urinary bone turnover markers, where reported, collection was the first morning void151 or
second morning void,44,56,137,142,152,158,161 storage temperature ranged from –20 °C44,137,140 to –70 °C,154,158
and the assay method used varied, with chemiluminescence10,162 and ELISA44,56,99,131,140,142,152,154,155,158,161
being used in studies that reported the assay; two of the studies using uNTX did not report whether or not
the results were corrected for creatinine.56,136 These limitations in the data prevented us from drawing any
strong conclusions regarding the relationship between change in bone turnover markers and BMD, or
fracture, from the results of these correlation analyses.
Correlations between changes in bone turnover markers and biopsy results and, more importantly, fracture
outcomes70 may be more useful than correlations between changes in bone turnover markers and BMD.
These two outcomes do not solely measure changes in bone density, but incorporate bone porosity and
microarchitecture. In addition, an assessment of the association with fracture incidence is a direct
assessment of the association with the event the bone turnover markers are attempting to predict at the
time of testing. The only study to report correlations to both BMD and fracture incidence showed that
post-menopausal women over 55 years of age receiving teriparatide reported statistically significant
correlations between changes in sP1NP at 1 month and BMD at 24 months, but not fracture.42 However,
the correlations with BMD were weak, and the correlation coefficients for the association with fracture
were not reported; therefore, the strength of the association with fracture is unclear. Whether this would
be true of other population–bone turnover marker–treatment combinations, or if sP1NP was measured
after more than 1 month of treatment, is uncertain.
The assessment of the relationship between changes in bone turnover markers and biopsy or fracture
outcomes would be further improved if confounding factors were adjusted for in a multivariate regression
analysis. Even if significant correlations are identified between bone turnover markers and these other
measures for fracture risk, it is unclear whether or not the use of correlation statistics fully explains the
relationship. If these variables were to be incorporated into a multiple regression analysis where other
important predictive variables are also included, it is possible that these other variables, or combination of
variables, may be stronger predictors of fracture risk than bone turnover markers. In addition, where there
is a non-significant association between change in bone turnover markers and fracture risk, the association
may change and become significant when other predictive factors are included in a multivariate regression
analysis, owing to a synergistic effect of combined variables. These apparently non-significant associations
may therefore be important influences within a multivariate regression analysis. Therefore, evaluations of
the association between changes in bone turnover markers and subsequent fracture risk outcomes should
incorporate confounding factors. In order to assess the accuracy of bone turnover markers in terms of their
ability to identify patients who remain at risk of fracture, research needs to be conducted to investigate
their independent predictive value of fracture risk.
Data from studies conducting multiple regression analyses gave some indications that a significant
association between the changes in bone turnover markers and the incidence of hip or vertebral fractures
in patients being treated with bisphosphonates was observed. However, although we have indicated that
data from multiple regression analyses that adjust for important confounding factors are of more value
than data from correlation analyses, the limited use of these analyses, and the heterogeneity across the
studies that did conduct them, limits the usefulness of these data.
CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS EVIDENCE

NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

As a consequence of the limitations of the data discussed, there is currently insufficient high-quality,
consistent evidence available to draw any firm conclusions on the ability of changes in bone turnover
markers to identify patients not responding to treatment, or to predict future fracture risk. There are
substantial gaps in the clinical evidence base, particularly in terms of the impact of bone turnover marker
monitoring on treatment management decisions, and the independent predictive value of bone turnover
markers for future fracture. Further research is required. However, given the large number of possible
combinations of patient population–treatment–monitoring regimens, decision-analytic modelling will be an
essential component of that research if we aim to inform efficient decision-making. Therefore, suggestions
for future research are discussed in Chapter 6, Suggested research priorities so that these can incorporate
the needs of the assessments of both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
Comparison with previous systematic reviews
One review included RCTs that compared antiresorptive treatment regimens with placebo in
post-menopausal women, reported associations between changes in a bone turnover marker (or BMD)
and the incidence of fracture.75 The review was based on 18 trials involving 26,494 women, which
amounted to 69,369 woman-years. Poisson regression analyses were used to investigate associations
between the difference in percentage change in bone turnover marker between the treatment and
placebo groups and the relative risk of fracture, weighted by woman-years. As with our review, the trials
were heterogeneous in terms of the bone turnover markers used, treatment regimens, patient population
and duration of follow-up over which fracture was assessed. Antiresorptive therapy in general resulted in a
decrease in resorption bone turnover marker, and a concomitant decrease in the rate of bone formation
turnover markers. Therefore, a decrease in either type of marker is seen as an indication of a reduction in
bone turnover. Overall, regression coefficients were 0.0067 [standard error (SE) 0.0034; range of change
in bone turnover marker compared with placebo across studies +1% to –70%] for changes in resorption
bone turnover marker and 0.0134 (0.0051; range of change in bone turnover marker compared with
placebo across studies +7% to –56%) for formation markers. There was a 40% decrease in fracture risk
for those treatments that decrease resorption markers by 70% compared with placebo and a 44%
decrease in fracture risk for those treatments that decrease formation markers by 50% compared with
placebo. Changes in bone turnover marker were significantly correlated with changes in BMD (p ≤ 0.002);
regression coefficient (R2
) = 0.58 for resorption markers and 0.41 for formation markers.75
It is unclear how comparable the results of this review are to our review, for several reasons. Firstly, trials
that evaluated calcitonin and alendronate combined with oestrogen were included in the analyses; these
are treatments not being considered in our review. Calcitonin is now authorised only for short-term use in
Paget’s disease and acute bone loss due to sudden immobilisation and hypercalcaemia caused by cancer,
and not for treatment of osteoporosis,180 and oestrogen is a HRT used to treat and prevent a range of
post-menopausal symptoms which could lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of alendronate.
Secondly, data for resorption markers (urinary deoxypyridinoline, CTX, NTX and urinary hydroxyproline)
were combined, as were data for formation markers (serum osteocalcin and sBALP); the specific bone
turnover markers used in each study were not reported in the publication, and therefore it is unclear how
many of the studies used the bone turnover markers being evaluated in our review. Thirdly, the analyses
were restricted to changes in bone turnover markers at 12 months (three studies used data from 6 months
where 12-month data were not available); our review was particularly interested in the changes at 3 (and
secondarily at 1 and 6) months, as it is the early detection of treatment non-responders that makes bone
turnover marker monitoring a potentially useful strategy. In addition, sensitivity analyses conducted by the
review authors showed that the overall statistically significant association between resorption and bone
formation turnover markers, and the risk of fracture was lost when the largest trial that administered
raloxifene was removed from the analysis (p = 0.09), and for resorption bone turnover markers when any
one of three alendronate trials were removed, two of which were the second and third largest trials.
Therefore, it is uncertain whether there are specific population–treatment–bone turnover marker
combinations that produce significant associations with fracture, or whether this is a sample size issue
and that most studies were underpowered to detect the association.

A second review that addressed a broader question, including studies of patients with and without
osteoporosis, conducted a separate analysis investigating the association between bone turnover markers
and fracture outcomes in osteoporotic patients receiving antiresorptive therapy.47 This section of the review
included seven publications; one of these reported only on the results of serum osteocalcin, which is not
being evaluated in our review. All six of the relevant studies included in the review by Vasikaran et al.47
were included in our review.40,132,137,139,151,161 The same data (results from regression analyses) were
extracted for both reviews from one study.151 However, the data extracted from the other studies varied
between the two reviews, making comparisons of the results of the two reviews more difficult. Vasikaran
et al. extracted the percentage treatment effect explained (TEE) for two of the studies,132,137 an outcome
not considered in our review; we extracted regression data from both of these studies,132,137 whereas
Vasikaran et al. extracted regression data from only one.132 Predictive data in the form of AUCs were
extracted by both reviews from one study; we also extracted regression data.161 Both reviews extracted
regression data from a further study; we extracted data only for sBALP, as this is the only bone turnover
marker that had results reported for the subgroup of patients with osteoporosis. The analyses of the other
bone turnover markers included patients with osteopenia who were not being considered in our review.139
For the final study included in the review by Vasikaran et al., we extracted data on the correlations
between bone turnover markers (sP1NP and sCTX) and fracture outcomes, whereas Vasikaran et al.40
extracted the relative risk/odds ratio of fracture for the treatment compared with placebo in the subgroup
of patients who had been tested using sP1NP. In addition, our review included results from regression
analyses from three studies,154,155,163 and other predictive data from three studies,142,156,163 that were not
included in the review by Vasikaran et al. The review by Vasikaran et al. did not consider results from
correlation analyses;47 we included data on correlations between bone turnover markers and fracture
from two studies.40,42
Vasikaran et al. concluded that the evidence available relating to the association between bone turnover
marker changes and fracture risk reduction is promising, but further studies are needed to address sample
handling, the timing of bone turnover marker testing, and the statistical methods used; an assessment of
whether or not the final bone turnover marker level is a guide to fracture risk was suggested. Vasikaran
et al. also included an assessment of the impact of bone turnover monitoring on adherence to osteoporosis
medication. Vasikaran et al. included two studies in this assessment, one of which was included in
our review56 and the other excluded as it was conducted on patients with osteopenia rather than
osteoporosis.181 We included a further four RCTs that evaluated the impact of feedback of bone turnover
marker results in patients with osteoporosis.133,143,148,149 Vasikaran et al.47 concluded that both of the studies
included in their review showed that the feedback of results from a positive result encouraged adherence,
and a negative result discouraged it. As already mentioned, this response may be surprising; however, the
two studies were conducted in populations that were not representative of a general osteoporotic
population or of a population of osteoporotic post-menopausal women (one conducted in older women
aged 65–80 years56 and the other in patients who had not yet developed osteoporosis181). Therefore, it is
unclear whether or not this response would be representative of the osteoporotic population seen in clinical
practice. In addition, the inclusion of additional RCTs in our review casts doubt on the impact of feedback
of bone turnover marker test results on compliance and adherence. However, as stated above in Limitations
of the available evidence, these studies are unlikely to be reflective of clinical practice.
A third review evaluated the use of bone turnover markers for the monitoring of osteoporosis therapy in
post-menopausal women.6 This review included 48 studies, most of which were excluded from our
review because they evaluated serum osteocalcin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAPc5b) or
P1CP; recruited patients who did not have osteoporosis or mixed populations where results for those
with osteoporosis were not reported separately; made comparisons between baseline bone turnover
marker test results and BMD or fracture outcomes only; had fewer than 20 treated patients in their
analyses; or received an osteoporotic treatment that was not one of those being considered in this review.
Of the 48 studies included in Funck-Brentano et al.,
6 nine assessed the correlation between changes in
bone turnover markers and either BMD or fracture risk in at least 20 patients with osteoporosis

receiving one of the treatments being considered in this review, and were therefore included in our
review.132,139,140,151,157,160,161,163,165 We included a further 17 studies that reported correlations between
bone turnover markers and BMD or fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis receiving one of the
treatment regimens of interest,14,38,40,42–44,58,99,106,131,135,145,146,153,155,159,160 two that reported correlations with
results from biopsy,150,152 and one that reported correlations with vertebral strength index.136 Funk-Brentano
et al.6 did not include data from regression analyses or other types of predictive data. The review by
Funk-Brentano et al. concluded that short-term changes in bone turnover markers were significantly
correlated with BMD variation, but there was no evidence that they predict benefit on fracture risk at the
individual level. A high proportion of the non-significant correlations were in those studies that also met
the inclusion criteria for our review and, therefore, if based solely on those nine studies, the conclusions
drawn are unlikely to have been so strong.
Summary
There was no evidence available evaluating the clinical effectiveness of treatment monitoring including
a bone turnover marker. The evidence available relating to the predictive accuracy, reliability and
reproducibility was heterogeneous and of low quality, precluding the ability to draw any conclusions as to
which bone turnover marker should be introduced into routine practice for the monitoring of response
to osteoporosis treatments in the absence of evidence from RCTs. Much of the available evidence was in
the form of correlations between changes in bone turnover BMD. As stated previously, BMD is a poor
surrogate for fracture risk on which to assess the accuracy of bone turnover markers, and any presumption
that bone turnover markers are not effective in identifying patients who are not responsive to treatment
and still at risk of fracture based on these data would be unwise. Further research is required, particularly
in terms of the impact of bone turnover marker monitoring on treatment management decisions, and the
independent predictive value of bone turnover markers for future fracture risk. However, suggestions for
future research need to be made with modelling in mind; therefore, in order to achieve this,
recommendations are discussed in the overall discussion (see Chapter 6, Suggested research priorities).
No studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover
marker monitoring strategies.

Chapter 4 Economic modelling
Methods for the methodological scoping review
In addition to the systematic review, we undertook a number of additional small focused searches of the
economic databases searched as part of the systematic review (HEED, IDEAS, and NHS EED) to identify
studies that modelled adherence and/or treatment change in patients in the context of monitoring treatment
response. The purpose was to identify modelling methods that may be useful for the development of
economic models in the future. No critical appraisal was planned. The objective was to survey the modelling
methods and provide a narrative synthesis. Data were extracted on the country, type of model, study
objective, adherence definition, approach to modelling adherence and the approach to modelling treatment
change. Full search strategies for each database searched are provided in Appendix 1.
Paper titles and abstracts were examined for relevance and all potentially relevant papers were ordered.
Papers were then screened for relevance by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by consensus.
Results of the methodological scoping review
The searches identified 130 records after deduplication; 21 papers were retrieved. Of these, 12 modelled
adherence to treatment for osteoporosis and one modelled treatment change and adherence, and were
included in the scoping review. The search strategy was not limited by indication, but did not identify any
studies that modelled adherence and/or treatment change as a result of monitoring treatment response
using a biomarker within a different indication. This section provides a narrative summary of the modelling
methods for adherence and treatment management used in the 12 included studies. Summary tables for
each study can be found in Appendix 5.
Country
The country setting for four studies was North America:167,182–184 three in the USA167,182,183 and one in
Canada.184 The remaining eight papers were conducted for western European countries.185–192 Five studies
were conducted by the same authors in Belgium,188–192 (these are included separately because there were
slight variations in the methods used), one was undertaken in the UK,187 one in Sweden,185 and one in the
Netherlands and the UK.186
Type of model
Nine studies were based on individual patient-level Markov (or state transition) microsimulation
models.182,185–192 Five of these were by the same group of Belgian investigators.188–192 Two studies used
a combined decision tree and Markov modelling approach,167,184 and one used a Markov cohort
model alone.183
Study objective
The objectives of the studies were to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different treatments for
osteoporosis;186–188,190 to model adherence or persistence to treatments of osteoporosis;182,183,185,189,191,192 to
model the cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve osteoporotic care by encouraging
patients to come forward and receive treatment after fracture of the wrist;184 and to evaluate different
follow-up regimes for antiresorptive treatments for post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.167
The latter assessed only health benefits, measured in QALYs, and did not include costs.

Adherence definition
Nine studies used the term ‘adherence’.
167,185–192 Ten studies used the term ‘compliance’.
167,182,185–192
Nine studies used the term ‘persistence’.
183–185,187–192
In Chapter 3 (see Assessment of clinical effectiveness) we adopted standard definitions for adherence,
compliance and persistence owing to variation in their use. Persistence is the time until discontinuation of
medication, compliance is the proportion of medication taken, and adherence is a combination of
persistence and compliance. The remaining sections will use these definitions, rather than those specified
by the study authors, to ensure consistency. However, where the terms used differ from these definitions,
this will be highlighted.
Compliance
Ten studies incorporated compliance into their modelling.167,182,185–192 In seven of the studies, cut-off
compliance thresholds were applied to delineate compliant from non-compliant patients. In four studies,
patients were considered to be compliant if their medical possession ratio (MPR) was ≥ 80%.185,190–192
In one study, compliance was defined in terms of the MPR which ranged from 10% to 100%.189 In two
studies, a compliance rate was used, but the threshold was not stated.186,188 Three studies assumed that
when a patient was on treatment then they were 100% compliant with their medication use.167,182,187
Persistence
Eleven studies incorporated persistence into their model.167,182–185,187–192 A definition of ‘primary
non-adherence’ was also mentioned in two studies and was used to describe the situation where patients
were prescribed a drug but never had the prescription filled.185,192
Compliance and persistence
Of the studies that modelled persistence, six were studies which modelled compliance using a range of
cut-offs between 0% and 100%.185,188–192 Other studies that modelled persistence assumed that all those
on treatment were fully compliant.
How compliance, persistence and adherence were modelled
Compliance
In the four studies which defined compliance as a MPR ≥ 80%, the probabilities of a MPR < 80% were
modelled with declining annual percentage rates assigned following the first, second and third years of
therapy;185,190–192 all conducted sensitivity analyses on the compliance rate. The rate of fracture depended
on the MPRs, which were derived from Belgian observational data. In the study where the compliance
threshold ranged from 10% to 100% based on individual patient data, the risk of hip fracture for the
different thresholds was again estimated from Belgian observational data, and the risk of non-hip fracture
was estimated from US observational data.189 In one study the compliance rate was estimated at 70.5%.188
In one study full compliance was assumed in each arm in the base-case analysis, but non-compliance was
assumed to be 30% in sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of different compliance rates on the
results.186 Three further studies assumed that when a patient was on treatment then they were 100%
compliant with their medication use.167,182,187 Two of these studies conducted sensitivity analyses on the
compliance rate.167,187 In one of these studies fracture risk for those adherent to treatment was further
differentiated depending on whether or not the patient was considered a treatment responder
or non-responder.167
Persistence
In related studies by the same authors, persistence was modelled as the percentage of patients who
initiated treatment and subsequently discontinued treatment at different time points ranging from
3 months to 2.5 years.188–192 The time points and the discontinuation rates varied between studies. In one
study, persistence rates were estimated for the first 3 years and then were assumed to be stable from
3 years until 5 years.185 Another study modelled persistence as 39% at 6 months and assumed a continual
ECONOMIC MODELLING

decrease thereafter over 5 years.183 The initial persistence rate was obtained from a clinical trial, and the
assumption of a continual decrease was derived from a UK general practitioner (GP) research database.
In another study, 1-year persistence was 80% and this was assumed to continue for the next 4 years.184
In one study, there was a probability of discontinuation every 3-month period, and patients were
permitted to reinitiate treatment (but there was no apparent switching to a different treatment).182
In one other study, persistence was assumed to be 50% over the duration of treatment.167
In three studies, patients modelled as discontinuing treatment at 3 months were assigned no treatment
benefit but incurred 3 months’ drug/treatment and monitoring costs.187–189 In four studies, patients
modelled as discontinuing treatment at 6 months were assigned no treatment benefit but incurred
3 months’ drug/treatment and monitoring costs.185,190–192
Compliance and persistence
In every paper judged as distinguishing the different aspects of adherence, compliance rates were applied
to patients continuing treatment. In two of these studies primary non-adherence was also incorporated
and was modelled as 4.6–11.6%.185,192 It was assumed that these patients incurred only the cost of a
physician visit and BMD measurement in one study,185 or cost of screening in another.192
How treatment management was modelled
Only one study incorporated a change of treatment into their model structure.167 The model allowed for
switching from a bisphosphonate to a second-line treatment, such as teriparatide, if results of a bone
turnover marker test during follow-up led to the conclusion that compliance or response to treatment was
inadequate. The authors appeared to have assumed that bone turnover markers were able to correctly
identify responders and non-responders to treatment, and so test accuracy data were not included in
their model.
Summary of approaches for modelling adherence and treatment change
Only one study modelled treatment change as a result of bone turnover marker monitoring during
treatment, and this study did not include test accuracy data. The other studies only modelled aspects of
adherence to treatment; compliance was the most commonly modelled variable, with persistence and
compliance being distinguished in some studies.
Compliance was considered a binary variable in most studies that modelled compliance. That would allow
a relative risk of compliance to be utilised in a model of monitoring strategies that gave test feedback to
patients to encourage adherence. The cut-off point for determining compliance/non-compliance was 80%
in several studies, chosen to be consistent with that reported in the literature, although it is not clear how
that cut-off point was derived. It is likely that there will be more evidence on the risk of fracture for
compliant and non-compliant patients defined with that cut-off point than for other cut-off points.
Potential confounders should be accounted for when estimating the relative risk of fracture between
compliant and non-compliant patients.
Real-life persistence rates were estimated, where possible, based on observational data from databases,
and hazard rates could be estimated if survival models fit the data. Six studies modelled compliance,
non-compliance and persistence separately, and therefore incorporated the different aspects of adherence.
Including an estimate of primary non-adherence where patients are prescribed treatment is a useful
approach if there are a significant proportion of patients for whom that applies. These primary
non-adherent patients would not be captured in a survival model.

Economic model
As previously stated, the systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses did not identify any relevant
published studies. In addition, the review of the clinical effectiveness evidence could not establish the
clinical effectiveness of bone turnover marker monitoring strategies. As well as a lack of clinical
effectiveness data, other key parameters for which there were inadequate data included the test accuracy
data at different time points; fracture risk given compliance and responder status; and the effect of bone
turnover marker feedback on compliance and persistence for different tests and treatment regimens.
Owing to the lack of these relevant data, no economic model was developed and consequently no
expected value of information analyses conducted. Expected value of information analyses can be
conducted only when valid estimates for the model parameters are available and valid estimates of
uncertainty are available for the relevant parameters.
This section, therefore, describes what the necessary information to undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis
of the treatment and monitoring strategies described in the section below, Modelling data requirements
for hypothetical strategy, might be, and the research that is required to fill the gaps in the current
evidence base.
The objective of an economic model is to determine the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for
monitoring treatment response and informing patient management decisions. There are two potential uses
of bone turnover marker tests within the proposed monitoring strategy: (1) to encourage patients to adhere
to treatment; and (2) to inform treatment change. The premise for both uses is that the bone turnover
marker tests can accurately identify response to treatment. The decision alternatives relevant to the decision
question posed will include various treatment and test combinations, including the option of no treatment.
The optimal test will depend on the choice of treatment, which includes the dose, frequency and mode of
delivery. The timing of the tests and associated decision rules may depend on the type of test (e.g. P1NP,
BALP, CTX) and the threshold cut-off point for determining treatment response and non-response. Decision
rules involve specifying a timetable of tests and the patient pathway that would be followed based on the
results of those tests. Having defined these alternatives, the cost-effectiveness of the alternative monitoring
strategies can be assessed.
Current practice
Based on discussion with a clinical advisor the timings of GP visits and DXA tests in current practice are
presented in Figure 3. In this monitoring strategy decisions on treatment change as a result of a poor DXA
test result occur at either 2 or 3 years, depending on whether or not a fracture occurred within the first
2 years. Decisions may also be influenced by the occurrence of side effects and patient statement on
compliance to treatment: if a patient discontinues treatment because of side effects, then a different class
of treatment may be prescribed. If there is a poor DXA test result and the patient claims to be compliant
to treatment then a new class of treatment would be prescribed; however, if the patient admits to
non-compliance then an alternative dose or mode of delivery of the same treatment may be appropriate,
where one is available.
Alternative monitoring strategy using bone turnover marker tests
We are not aware of any published guidelines on the use of bone turnover markers in the UK for
monitoring response to treatment for osteoporosis which could be used to inform alternative monitoring
strategies incorporating bone turnover markers. Therefore, based on discussion with a clinical advisor, a
feasible monitoring strategy using bone turnover marker tests was constructed and is presented in Figure 3.
The purpose of this figure is to allow the presentation and discussion around the type of data that might be
required to evaluate similar strategies.
The numbers in circles indicate four different stages to the strategy. In this hypothetical strategy, patients
are started on treatment at stage 1. At stage 2, after 3–6 months, depending on the type of test and
treatment, a first bone turnover marker test is done. The results are fed back to the patients in order to

improve, or encourage continued, adherence. At stage 3, a second bone turnover marker test is done
only for patients who received a negative result on the first test. This would be done at 6–12 months
depending on the type of test and treatment. Using a predefined decision rule after a second negative test
result, a treatment change would be recommended. The clinician may recommend a new treatment class
to everyone with two negative test results. Alternatively, if the clinician has assessed patient adherence, he
or she may recommend a new treatment class only to adherent patients and a different mode of delivery
and/or frequency of the same treatment class to non-adherent patients where one is available.
Given the lack of evidence, it has not been possible to determine clinically relevant strategies for
evaluation. The timing of the bone turnover marker tests may vary by the type of test used and the type of
treatment administered that the test is monitoring a response to. The optimal timing of a bone turnover
marker test needs to be determined by, for example, studies that evaluate the S/N ratio at different time
points; there may be a trade-off between a greater S/N ratio and delay to response monitoring. While
some S/N ratio data were identified in the review, these were inadequate to address the issue of optimal
timing and combination of treatment and tests.
Different cost-effectiveness analysis methods
Based of the review of modelling methods, the two most common models employed to address this type
of decision question are:
(a) individual patient-level Markov simulation
(b) decision tree and Markov model combined.
Both of these modelling methods require the combination of evidence on the risk of fracture given different
risk factors, the effect of feedback on response rates and bone turnover marker test accuracy data.
Modelling data requirements for hypothetical strategy
Stage 1: osteoporosis treatment
At the start of the model a population will be defined and individuals will be assigned characteristics. For
this discussion our population will comprise post-menopausal women. Each woman will belong to an age
group, will have an assigned T-score (e.g. < –2.5) and a fracture history (e.g. no prior fractures or two prior
fractures). She will start on treatment for osteoporosis. Based on her characteristics (e.g. T-score < –2.5, no
prior fractures, aged 55 years) and treatment (e.g. oral bisphosphonates) there will be an associated
fracture risk. That risk will vary depending on whether a patient is a responder or non-responder
to treatment.
The ideal method to model the true-positive, false-positive, true-negative and false-negative test results,
and their impact on treatment change later on in the model, is to distinguish patients by treatment
response defined by a cut-off point related to the test being used. The fracture risk for these population
groups would need to be determined. The optimal cut-off point in terms of the least significant change for
any of the bone turnover markers is uncertain.
Stage 2: initial monitoring stage
The second stage of the model occurs when the first bone turnover marker test is done. In our
hypothetical strategy this is at 3 months, but in clinical practice this would be a variable optimal time point
determined for each test and treatment combination being evaluated. Bone turnover markers test for
treatment response. In the hypothetical strategy we have assumed that poor results of the first bone
turnover marker test feedback will be a signal to the clinician to encourage compliance and persistence.
Stage 3: the effect of bone turnover marker tests on treatment change
Stage 3 of the model is when a second bone turnover marker test is done to identify response to
treatment. At this stage clear decision rules regarding what defines a responder from a non-responder in
ECONOMIC MODELLING

terms of bone turnover marker test results would be required. Only patients with a negative result from
the first test get a second test. The decision rule considered in the hypothetical strategy is that a change in
treatment class would occur only if there were two negative test results.
Stage 4: the effect of a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry test on the
treatment pathway
At stage 4 of the hypothetical strategy DXA testing is conducted at 2 or 3 years after the start of
treatment. DXA testing is also done in current practice at 2 or 3 years.
Test accuracy
When diagnostic or prognostic tests are included in a decision-analytic model, test accuracy needs
to be considered and the clinical outcomes for patients with correct (true-positive and true-negative) and
incorrect (false-positive and false-negative) test results need to be incorporated.193 Test accuracy will be an
important factor in any decision model used to investigate the current decision problem as test errors may
result in an incorrect treatment pathway being followed. A non-responder incorrectly identified as a
responder (false-positive) would likely remain on their current treatment, and would not benefit from a
change in treatment class. Conversely, a responder who was incorrectly classified as a non-responder
(false-negative) may be prescribed a different drug unnecessarily. Where patients have true-positive
(a responder identified as a responder) or true-negative (a non-responder identified as a non-responder)
results, they will benefit from appropriate treatment management choices based on the correct test results.
For this decision problem, test accuracy will need to be determined for each of the tests within the
pathway; in the example, test accuracy for bone turnover markers would be needed for stages 2 and 3,
and test accuracy for DXA at stage 4. The major limitation for establishing the accuracy of bone turnover
marker tests in identifying treatment non-responders is the lack of a gold standard.
There are a range of reference standards available, but each has its limitations. Bone biopsy could be
seen as the ideal reference standard. However, given the invasiveness of the test and the high risk of
complications it would be considered unethical to conduct studies where all patients would undergo
biopsy to confirm treatment response. The next most complete reference standard would be the use of
BMD with clinical follow-up to determine fracture incidence to supplement the BMD results. Where BMD
indicated a response to treatment sufficient enough to reduce a patient’s fracture risk but the patient went
on to have a fragility fracture, the patient could be reclassified as a non-responder. This would mean that
if the bone turnover marker was negative in this patient, it would be reclassified from a false-negative to a
true-negative. Whether a patient who did not have a response in BMD but did not go on to have a
fragility fracture within a certain time frame could be reclassified from a non-responder to a responder is
less certain.
Less perfect reference standards are the incidence of fracture alone and BMD alone, the latter being the
poorest available reference standard. The lack of suitability of BMD as a surrogate for fracture risk against
which we can judge the accuracy of bone turnover tests is discussed in Chapter 3 (see Limitations of the
available evidence). An alternative method for estimating the test error rates for a test at a particular time
point would be to use the intraindividual variation data that is used to calculate S/N ratios, but these
estimates may be inferior to test accuracy data with an appropriate comparator.194 When establishing the
accuracy of DXA, the only reference standards are bone biopsy and fracture incidence, and the limitations
of these have already been discussed.
Once the proportion of true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives and false-negatives had been
established, fracture risk for each of these groups would need to be estimated.
Measures of adherence
As discussed previously, adherence has two aspects: compliance and persistence – both of these are
important causes of non-response to osteoporosis treatment. Clearly, adherence to treatment will affect a

patient’s response to treatment, at all stages of the treatment pathway. Therefore, any attempt to model
adherence would apply to each stage in Figure 3. Several studies modelling the effectiveness of treatment
have modelled compliance and persistence. Our decision problem involves the ability of tests to identify
treatment responders and non-responders rather than to establish treatment effectiveness. For patients
identified by a test as a non-responder (bone turnover markers at stage 2 and 3; DXA at stage 4),
treatment non-response could have a number of causes, including: non-compliance; non-persistence;
an underlying, untreated cause of the osteoporosis; an inability to absorb the drug; and/or test error.
The issue of test accuracy has been addressed in earlier in this chapter (see Test accuracy).
Including measures of adherence in the model would be of use only if there would be different treatment
pathways for adherent and non-adherent non-responders, and/or there was evidence that feedback of
bone turnover marker test results increased adherence. It is possible that there would be different
treatment pathways for adherent and non-adherent non-responders for those who were treated with
first-line oral bisphosphonates, as true non-responders are unlikely to respond to a different dosing
frequency or mode of administration, but patients who are non-compliant with a daily or weekly oral dose
may become compliant with a monthly oral dose or intravenous administration. Therefore, the importance
of modelling adherence may differ depending on the choice of first-line treatment. Adherence rates may
improve by providing feedback from bone turnover marker tests to the patients, but there is no strong
evidence for this effect.
The ideal method to model adherence would be to include adherence from the start of treatment.
A primary non-adherence estimate could be modelled, which is a percentage of patients who are
recommended treatment but do not start treatment. This could be estimated from the number of
prescriptions that are not filled; however, this would underestimate the value, as some patients may have
a prescription filled and not commence treatment. To include measures of adherence in subsequent stages
of a model, the proportions of non-compliant non-responders and compliant non-responders would need
to be established. There are limitations with the methods available for determining these estimates. It is
likely that the most common means of identifying these data would be based on patient reporting, which
is prone to bias. Measures such as the MPR rate are also problematic, as patients may have their
prescriptions filled but not take all of the medication prescribed. In the case of bisphosphonates, patients
may take their tablets but not comply with the strict regimen required, adding a further complication to
the establishment of a rate of compliance. Persistence could be estimated by reviewing the attrition rates
from RCTs evaluating treatment effectiveness; this would likely underestimate the rate. Such a review
could be supplemented with data from observational studies that use sources such as GP databases.183
Any estimate of compliance, persistence or overall adherence would be highly uncertain, making it
extremely important that it is incorporated into the modelling in a manner which allows appropriate
sensitivity analysis to be undertaken.
In addition to the adherence data, the fracture risk for these population groups would also need to be
determined. If it can be assumed that the relative risk of fracture given treatment versus no treatment is
based on a compliant population, then the relative risk of fracture given good compliance versus poor
compliance enables the calculation of the risk of fracture for poorly compliant patients to treatment. There
would be an interaction between compliance and response. The optimal cut-off point is uncertain and
needs to be established prior to modelling.
One aspect of adherence deserves separate consideration, namely discontinuation rates due to
treatment-related adverse events; this is a particular issue for bisphosphonates. Gastrointestinal upsets
are common with oral bisphosphonate therapy, but an additional, serious, side effect would have to be
incorporated in the model; osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). This is a side effect specific to the use of
bisphosphonates, and can lead to the need for costly dental surgery. Although this is a rare adverse event,
there is some evidence that the risk of developing ONJ is much higher with intravenous bisphosphonates
than with oral preparations.195 The rate of ONJ may be investigated initially by a review of long-term RCTs

that evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonate therapy; the review could supplement
these data with the available prospective observational and retrospective studies.
Summary of modelling approaches and available evidence
The key part of a cost-effectiveness analysis of bone turnover marker tests for monitoring response to
treatment for osteoporosis is accounting for test accuracy, the prognostic outcomes for true- and
false-positive and negative test outcomes, and the effect of bone turnover marker feedback on patient
adherence to treatment. This affects both who benefits from bone turnover marker feedback and who
benefits from treatment change. These data were either absent completely in the evidence identified in
this review, were insufficient given the different tests and treatments, or were applicable to populations
with unrealistic adherence rates for clinical practice.
Compliance and persistence are commonly modelled separately. The effect of test feedback on adherence
is often reported as the effect on compliance or persistence. Given the relationship between the two and
bone turnover marker levels, this does require assumptions to simplify the model.
This section has focused on those gaps in the evidence that would be essential to any future
decision-analytic model but may be difficult to establish estimates for. Other variables, such as estimates
of treatment effectiveness and data on utilities or other relevant QoL outcomes, would be required.
Information would also be required on resource use, including the cost of tests, GP/clinic visits, treatment
costs, and the costs associated with treating serious side effects such as ONJ.

Chapter 5 Discussion
Statement of principal findings
The systematic review of clinical effectiveness found no evidence evaluating the impact of treatment
monitoring regimens that included a relevant bone turnover marker on treatment management decisions.
The review identified limited data assessing the effect of bone turnover marker feedback on patient
compliance, persistence and/or adherence to treatment, the results of which suggested that the positive
feedback results encouraged patient adherence.
A moderate number of correlation data were identified relating to the predictive accuracy of the four bone
turnover markers, namely P1NP, BALP, CTX and NTX, in osteoporotic patients being treated with one of
the targeted drug therapies: bisphosphonates, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, teriparatide and denosumab.
Most correlations had a small effect size, indicating a weak association between changes in the level of
bone turnover markers (usually between 1 month and 6 months of starting treatment) and subsequent
changes in BMD (usually between 1 year and 3 years after the start of treatment). The studies that used
regression analyses to adjust for confounding factors when evaluating the association between bone
turnover markers and either subsequent changes in BMD or fracture gave some indication that changes in
bone turnover markers may be significantly associated with these outcomes; however, there were too few
of these studies to draw any firm conclusions.
In terms of the evaluation of the test reliability and reproducibility, some available evidence suggested that
sP1NP may have a greater S/N ratio than sBALP and sCTX at short-term follow-up, but the data on this
outcome were sparse and longer-term follow-up data absent.
Overall, the evidence required to address the decision problem was lacking, and the limited evidence that
was available was heterogeneous and of poor quality. Consequently, it was impossible to draw any
conclusion as to whether bone turnover markers were able to identify treatment non-responders or predict
fracture risk independently of BMD in patients receiving osteoporosis treatment.
The systematic review of cost-effectiveness identified no studies evaluating different treatment monitoring
strategies, where BALP, P1NP, CTX or NTX were incorporated as part of one of the strategies. Given the
lack of evidence on the clinical effectiveness of bone turnover marker monitoring on treatment
management, a de novo decision-analytic model could not be developed, and consequently the value of
any future research could not be investigated.
The scoping review of modelling methods used in the broader context of osteoporosis treatment identified
12 modelling studies, of which only one modelled treatment change. A range of methods were used to
deal with modelling adherence; adherence was defined in different ways, but several studies distinguished
between compliance and persistence components of adherence which was consistent with the standard
definitions that this review adopted from Delmas.56 Compliance was defined using the MPR, and the
threshold for distinguishing compliant and non-compliant patients varied, although 80% was the most
common threshold. Real-life persistence rates based on observational data were often modelled for
different time points, and primary non-adherence, where patients fail to start treatment, was also included
in two studies. Separating these different components of adherence presents a practical method of
modelling adherence and the effect of adherence on fracture risk. The one model that incorporated
treatment change allowed for switching if the clinician concluded that compliance or response to
treatment was inadequate, but the authors assumed perfect test accuracy.

Strengths and limitations of the assessment
Strengths
We conducted a rigorous systematic review which addressed clear research questions using pre-defined
inclusion criteria. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to locate all relevant published and
unpublished studies without any language restrictions, thereby minimising both publication and language
biases. Efforts were also made to identify additional studies by hand-searching the reference lists of relevant
publications. We are therefore confident that we have been able to include all the relevant studies
in the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness, predictive accuracy, reliability and reproducibility, and
cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for monitoring treatment response that met our inclusion criteria.
Each stage of the review was conducted in duplicate, reducing the risk of error and bias. Owing to the high
degree of clinical heterogeneity across the studies in terms of patient populations, treatment regimens and
duration of follow-up, the clinical data were appropriately synthesised using a narrative approach.
As we were unable to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, we conducted additional assessments of the
economic models used to address similar decision problems in order to inform future decision-analytic
modelling that may be undertaken to address the decision problem investigated in this review.
Limitations
The main limitations of the review of clinical effectiveness were the lack of data on the effectiveness of
monitoring regimens and the poor quality of the data that were available; all of the included studies were
judged as low quality. This lack of robust data relating to the comparative predictive values of the different
bone turnover marker tests for monitoring the response to a specific osteoporosis treatment precludes the
possibility of determining which bone turnover marker, if any, is superior in terms of its ability to identify
treatment non-responders and predict future fracture risk when used for monitoring osteoporosis treatment.
Despite the moderate amount of correlation data identified for the evaluation of the relationship between
changes in bone turnover markers and BMD, it remains unclear whether or not these findings can also be
utilised as an indicator of the association with the outcome of fracture risk. As discussed in Chapter 3
(see Limitations of the available evidence), BMD is a poor surrogate for fracture risk.47,70,177,178
Treatment-induced changes in BMD account for a limited proportion of the observed reduction in fracture
risk;91,178 therefore, using BMD as a surrogate for assessing the accuracy of bone turnover markers for
identifying patients on treatment who remain at risk of fracture is inappropriate.
Although the incidence of fracture is a more robust outcome measure for fracture risk,70 there was a
paucity of data correlating the changes in bone turnover marker levels to this outcome. There was also a
paucity of studies that adjusted the associations between changes in bone turnover markers and either
changes in BMD, fracture, or other measures such as spinal strength indices or results of biopsy, for
confounders in multiple regression analyses. As discussed in Chapter 3, where strong associations are
identified between bone turnover markers and fracture or other measures in correlation analyses, there is
no evidence that these would produce significant associations when other important confounding
variables are included in regression analyses. Alternatively, where there is a non-significant correlation
between change in bone turnover markers and one of these outcomes, the association may change and
become significant when other predictive factors are included in a multivariate regression analysis. Either
way, assessing the association between changes in bone turnover markers and any outcome in isolation,
without adjusting for confounders within a multivariate regression analysis, is unlikely to reflect the true
association between these variables within a patient; it was impossible to draw any conclusion as to
whether or not these bone turnover markers were able to identify treatment non-responders and predict
fracture risk independently of BMD measurements in patients receiving osteoporosis treatment.
It should be noted that the results from the studies utilising correlation and regression analyses were
inconsistent. This may be due to the considerable clinical heterogeneity across the included studies in
terms of the definitions used to identify those with osteoporosis for inclusion in the studies, patient

populations recruited, the treatment regimens administered, and the type and timing of the tests being
evaluated. Most of the included studies had small sample sizes, resulting in low statistical power to detect
a significant association.
The analysis of test reliability and reproducibility in women being treated for osteoporosis was limited; very
few studies reported these data. Test reliability and reproducibility is most commonly measured in either
healthy individuals or control subjects who are not receiving treatment. Although this provides baseline
intraindividual and interindividual CVs and a S/N ratio, it does not inform us as to how these tests perform
in women receiving treatment. Whether receiving treatment would increase or decrease these measures of
variability is unknown.
The lack of any published decision-analytic models investigating the decision problem being addressed in
this review, and the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of monitoring treatment response using bone
turnover markers, meant that the cost-effectiveness of different monitoring strategies could not be
investigated at this time. In order to construct such a model, the large gaps in the current evidence base
will need to be filled. We identified these gaps and the data required for a future cost effectiveness
analysis of different monitoring strategies and discussed how these data could be obtained in Chapter 4
(see Economic model). The uncertainties that remain and research priorities are highlighted in the section
below and in Chapter 6 (see Suggested research priorities), respectively.
Uncertainties
There are currently large gaps in the evidence base relating to the use of bone turnover markers for
monitoring osteoporosis treatment. These include:
l the ability of changes in bone turnover markers to identify treatment non-responders
l the ability of changes in bone turnover markers to impact on compliance, persistence and adherence
to each of the treatments being evaluated
l the accuracy of changes in bone turnover markers to predict future fracture risk
l the ability of bone turnover markers to inform treatment change
l the most appropriate timing of the conduct of bone turnover marker testing; this may vary depending
on the treatment–test combination
l which bone turnover marker is superior in terms of its ability to identify treatment non-responder and
predict fracture risks for monitoring specific osteoporosis treatments
l the reliability and reproducibility of bone turnover marker tests in patients receiving treatment
for osteoporosis
l the most cost-effective monitoring regimen for patients being treated with bisphosphonates,
raloxifene, strontium ranelate, teriparatide or denosumab.

Chapter 6 Conclusions
Implications for service provision
The lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, and the heterogeneity and poor quality of the available
evidence on the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of bone turnover markers for monitoring response
to osteoporosis treatment, precluded the possibility of making any recommendations on the choice of
bone turnover marker being used in routine clinical practice for its superiority to monitor osteoporosis
treatment response. In addition, the evidence to support the use of bone turnover marker feedback results
to improve patient adherence to osteoporosis treatment was not convincing.
Suggested research priorities
In order to determine whether or not bone turnover marker monitoring improves treatment management
decisions and ultimately impacts on patient outcomes in terms of reduced incidence of fracture, RCTs are
required. The predictive accuracy of bone turnover markers for future fracture outcomes in patients
receiving osteoporosis treatment could be investigated using prospective, long-term observational studies
with large sample sizes. However, as the nature of bone turnover marker response is determined by the
mechanism of action of the drug, any future research needs to identify the most appropriate treatment–
test combinations in order to identify whether or not the predictive accuracy of a particular bone turnover
marker can be maximised to aid treatment management decisions. All future studies should adopt a
standardised definition of osteoporosis, such as the WHO criteria.7
There are potentially a large number of patient population–treatment–test combinations; therefore,
conducting RCTs or even larger observational studies to establish the effectiveness for all of these
combinations would not be feasible. Therefore, it is likely that identifying the most promising combinations
would be beneficial in order to ensure that the most promising are evaluated in the more costly and
time-consuming studies such as RCTs. This would include not only identifying which bone turnover test
best identifies non-responders to specific treatments, but also the optimal timing of these tests. This may
feasibly be achieved through the use of a patient registry, where relevant pre-specified standardised data
would be collected and trends both in the use of different tests and in outcomes related to test–treatment
combinations could be identified. However, without more widespread use of these tests in clinical practice,
the usefulness of such a registry would be questionable. If a registry is not established, a survey of the
current use of bone turnover markers may be useful. An alternative to establishing a registry to identify
promising test–treatment combinations might be to undertake smaller, less costly studies that identify
those treatment–bone turnover marker combinations that have the lowest inter- and intraindividual patient
variability (and therefore a higher S/N ratio). These smaller feasibility studies could be used to help to
identify the most promising combinations for future more costly research. Such studies would be of use
only when conducted in the context of establishing inter- and intraindividual patient variability in bone
turnover markers and would not be useful if the decision was made to either establish a patient registry,
or if there was considered to be sufficient experience within the clinical setting already available to identify
treatment-test combinations that could be evaluated in effectiveness studies.
To further limit the number of RCTs and other costly and time-consuming research, there are some
areas of uncertainty that could be classified as low priority. These could be investigated initially within a
decision-analytic framework, once sufficient evidence becomes available on monitoring effectiveness and
the predictive value of bone turnover markers. By using this strategy, those areas of uncertainty that are
key drivers of cost-effectiveness can be identified. Further research can then focus on investigating the
impact of those areas of uncertainty that most influence the cost-effectiveness of the monitoring regimens,
rather than being conducted to inform those estimates and assumptions to which the cost-effectiveness
analysis is robust.

We consider that the research priority is to identify the most promising treatment–test combinations.
This can be achieved either by conducting small variability studies or, if more widespread use is feasible,
by initiating a patient registry to collect data. The former would be quicker, easier and less costly, but the
quality of the data would be poorer and likely to be collected in small selected populations. This would
mean that the results may not reflect the broader population seen in clinical practice, and the choices
made as to which treatment–test combinations to evaluate in a RCT may be inappropriate. Once the most
promising treatment–test combinations have been identified, well-designed RCTs can be conducted to
evaluate the clinical effectiveness of those monitoring regimens; this would include measuring outcomes
such as the proportion of non-responders, adherence rates, treatment management decisions, and fracture
outcome. Data from these RCTs along with other sources can then be included in a decision-analytic
model in order to investigate cost-effectiveness.

Guidelines for completing the quality assessment
1. Patient selection
Randomised – method appropriate: random numbers computer generated or number table, controlled by external source
(pharmacy, biochemistry laboratory), or similar
Randomised – method not reported: date of birth, day of recruitment or similar
Randomised – no details: states patients were randomised but did not report method used
Consecutive recruitment: non-randomised study: all patients recruited consecutively
Non-consecutive recruitment: non-randomised study: selective recruiting
Post hoc analysis of prior RCT: results of patients recruited prospectively into a RCT were reanalysed
Post hoc analysis of prior cohort: results of patients recruited prospectively into a cohort study were reanalysed
Random selection (derived cohort): patients were recruited prospectively into a RCT comparing an antiresorptive drug of
interest with placebo or an alternative drug; those receiving a drug of interest were treated in the review as a
prospective cohort
Patients were selected for an open-label extension of a RCT
Unclear: ‘patient selection’ mentioned but no details as to method used
Not reported: no mention of a patient selection process, just number included in the study
2. Population representative
Yes: the population in the study is representative of that expected in clinical practice (i.e. a heterogeneous population of
patients with osteoporosis or a study recruiting unselected post-menopausal women with osteoporosis); population details
includes the drug regimen
No: the population in the study is not representative of that expected in clinical practice (i.e. it is in a subgroup of patients),
a selected population of post-menopausal women, or it is a study in a heterogeneous population that excludes
specific subgroups)
Unclear: there was insufficient information to determine whether or not the population in the study is representative of
that expected in clinical practice
3. Allocation concealment
Method appropriate: sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes or containers, controlled by external source
(pharmacy, biochemistry laboratory), or similar
Method inappropriate: the method used was not one of those stated above, for example date of birth, day of recruitment
Unclear: details regarding allocation concealment were not reported
Not applicable: single-arm study or data from a RCT used as a derived cohort
4. Control group selection appropriate
Yes: part of an adequate randomisation/allocation concealment in RCTs, or drawn from same population at the same time
in observational studies
No: drawn from a different population or time (e.g. historical control)
Unclear: details regarding the selection of controls were not reported
Not applicable: single-arm study or data from a RCT used as a derived cohort
5. Baseline comparability
Yes: baseline characteristics were similar across groups
No: baseline characteristics were not similar across groups
Unclear: insufficient details provided to determine similarity across groups at baseline
Not applicable: single-arm study or data used as a derived cohort from a RCT

whether or not loss was random
No: characteristics of those who dropped out were not reported and no comparison with those who remained in the
study was made
12. Loss to follow-up: reasons given

No: a measure of variance was not reported around the point estimate; this not inappropriate for a correlation coefficient
16. Adverse events reported
Yes: adverse events associated with the BMs were reported
No: adverse events associated with the BMs were not reported
Not applicable: the study was a derived cohort where BMs were an outcome measure not an intervention
17. Duration of follow-up

≥ 1 year: follow-up was at least 1 year in all patients
Unclear: the duration of follow-up was not reported
18. Confounders: clearly described
Yes: potentially confounding factors described
No: potentially confounding factors not described
Not applicable: RCT with appropriate methods of randomisation
19. Confounders: all important confounders adjusted for
Yes: all important confounding factors (age, gender, prior fracture, baseline BMD, BMI) were adjusted for in the analysis

confounding factors
Unclear: it was not clear whether adjustments were made or, if they were, the variables adjusted for were not reported
Not applicable: RCT with appropriate methods of randomisation and ITT analysis
Overall quality:
High: the study is not subject to bias, or the bias/limitations of the study will not impact on the reliability of the results
RCTs: appropriate randomisation and allocation concealment methods used; patients, carers, investigators and
outcome assessors blinded; ITT results reported using established imputation methods; minimum of 1-year follow-up
in all patients
Cohort studies: patients were recruited consecutively from a representative population with a control group
recruited from the same population, methods and interventions were clearly defined to allow repetition, all important
confounders were identified and adjusted for in the analyses, and all patients were followed up for at least 1 year
Derived cohorts from RCTs: the cohort was derived from a RCT with appropriate randomisation and allocation
concealment methods were used; patients, carers, investigators and outcome assessors blinded; ITT results reported;
minimum of 1-year follow-up in all patients.
APPENDIX 2
130
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

Moderate: the study is subject to bias/limitations, but these are unlikely to significantly impact on the reliability of
the results
RCTs: appropriate randomisation and allocation concealment methods used but some imbalance at baseline in
non-essential confounders; outcome assessors blinded; ITT results reported; mean/median follow-up at least 1 year
Cohort studies: patients were not recruited consecutively but were from a representative population with a control
group recruited from the same population or patients were recruited consecutively from a representative population
with no control group, methods and interventions were clearly defined to allow repetition, confounders were
identified and adjusted for in the analyses, and the mean/median follow-up was 1 year or longer
Derived cohorts: the cohort was derived from a RCT where appropriate randomisation and allocation concealment
methods were used; patients and outcome assessors blinded; ITT reported; mean/median follow-up at least 1 year
Post hoc analyses: the analysis was based on all the patients from a RCT with appropriate randomisation and
allocation concealment methods were used; patients, carers, investigators and outcome assessors blinded; ITT results
reported; minimum of 1-year follow-up in all patients
Low: the study is subject to bias/limitations, and these are likely to significantly impact on the reliability of the results
RCTs: the RCT fails to meet one of the essential criteria (appropriate randomisation or allocation concealment methods;
blinding of patients and outcome assessors) or extreme imbalance at baseline in essential confounders, and follow-up
was not at least 1 year in all patients
Cohort studies: patients were not recruited consecutively, there was no control group, important confounders were
not identified and/or adjusted for in the analyses, and the minimum follow-up was not at least 1 year in all patients
Derived cohorts: the cohort was derived from a RCT that failed to meet one of the essential criteria (appropriate
randomisation or allocation concealment methods; blinding of patients and outcome assessors) and follow-up was
not at least 1 year in all patients
Post hoc analyses: the analysis was based on a subset of the patients from a RCT, all the patients from a RCT
that would be considered as moderate or low quality, or patients from a cohort study
Unclear: there is insufficient information to judge the quality of the study

Systematic review of the cost-effectiveness evidence
1. Examined health benefits only.167
2. Review article mentioned cost-effectiveness in the abstract, but reported only the characteristics and
clinical effectiveness of bone turnover markers in the results; bibliography was scanned for relevant
cost-effectiveness studies but none was cited.497

Appendix 5 Summary of the methods for
modelling adherence and treatment management
Study Question Summary
Charpurlat
(2002)167
Country?
Type of model?
USA
Decision tree (3 months) and Markov model (post 3 months to 5 years)
Study objective? To explore the potential value of bone markers to monitor
antiresorptive treatments of osteoporosis
Two different treatment pathways were compared: (1) without specific
follow-up (no BM, no BMD, only simple short-term follow-up to rule
out adverse reactions) and (2) follow-up including an early
measurement of a serum marker of bone resorption (3 months after
beginning treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis)
Adherence definition? The terms adherence and compliance appeared to be used
interchangeably. Compliance with treatment was considered as a
dichotomous variable: patients were assumed to take 100% of their
medication or not to take it at all
How was adherence
modelled?
Adherence rates were assumed to be constant over the time horizon of
the model. In the upfront decision tree part of the model, the
population cohort was divided into adherent and non-adherent groups
according to an adherence rate estimate, which was assumed to be
50% in the base case
It was assumed that bone marker feedback would not increase
adherence, owing to lack of evidence. The effect of feedback on
adherence was varied in sensitivity analysis
The adherent population was further divided into responders and
non-responders, given a 3% non-response rate obtained from clinical
experts. No response was described as a real bone tissue resistance.
This was varied from 3% to 30% in sensitivity analysis
How was treatment
management modelled?
Permitted in the model if: ‘the BM measurement leads to the
conclusion that compliance or response to treatment was inadequate.
The second treatment might pertain to a different pharmacological
class, such as parathyroid hormone’
It was assumed that markers were able to identify true and false
responders and non-responders. So no test accuracy data were
included in the model
Earnshaw
(2007)183
Country?
Type of model?
USA
A Markov cohort model
Study objective? To model the cost-effectiveness of a monthly and weekly
bisphosphonates as an example and explicitly examine differences in
costs and outcomes related to persistence
Adherence definition? Only persistence was included in the model. Persistence was the time
spent on medication
How was adherence
modelled?
Persistence rates were derived from a clinical trial. Persistence was
found to be 39% at 6 months for weekly alendronate (and 57% for
ibandronate). In this model, they assumed persistence on
bisphosphonates would be that value. A continual decrease in
persistence was modelled post 6 months over 5 years by extrapolating
data from persistence studies and longer-term drug utilisation patterns
from a UK GP research database. These data approximated a Weibull
distribution. Discontinuation is modelled as having no treatment.
There was no switch to an alternative

Markov microsimulation
Study objective? To describe and validate an original Markov microsimulation model to
accurately assess the cost-effectiveness of the prevention and treatment
of osteoporosis
Adherence definition? Adherence was divided into compliance and persistence
Persistence was the time spent taking treatment
Compliance was how appropriately the correct treatment was taken.
No cut-off point was specified
How was adherence
modelled?
Medication costs and fracture reduction efficacy were assumed to be
proportional to compliance
The compliance rate was estimated at 70.5% for persistent women
from a clinical study
It was assumed that 30%, 12%, 18%, and 15% of patients stopped
drug therapy after 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years from
the same clinical study

Type of model?
Belgium
Markov microsimulation
Study objective? To evaluate the potential clinical and economic implications of
non-adherence to bisphosphonate therapy
Adherence definition? ISPOR definition
Adherence: a general term, encompassing two different constructs,
i.e. persistence and compliance
Compliance: the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the
prescribed interval and dose of a dosing regimen. Often expressed as the
number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed (MPR)
Persistence: the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of
therapy. The proportion of patients receiving treatment at a given
time period
How was adherence
modelled?
A Markov microsimulation model was developed. Persistence and
compliance with bisphosphonate therapies were derived from a large
observational (Belgian) study. Two persistence scenarios were modelled:
full persistence over 3 years and real-world persistence
Real-world persistence: assumed that 30%, 12%, 18% and 15%
discontinued therapy at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years of
therapy.176 If patients discontinued therapy at 3 months, they were
assumed to receive no treatment benefit, but 3 months of drug and
monitoring costs were incurred. Patients who discontinued therapy
were assumed to receive no further treatment

Study Question Summary
Compliance measured as MPR ranged from 10% to 100% in a data
set. There was a gradient of compliance rates. The relative risk (RR) of
fracture was dependent on the MPR value and the drug cost was
assumed to be proportional to the MPR. It was assumed that the
effectiveness of oral bisphosphonates in the meta-analysis was
applicable to a population with an MPR value of 80%
For hip fracture, a linear reduction between the MPR value and the
probability of fracture was suggested by a Belgian study. A non-linear
relationship for non-hip fracture was found from a US observational study

Country?
Type of model?
Belgium
Markov microsimulation
Study objective? To estimate the cost-effectiveness of denosumab compared with oral
bisphosphonates (branded and generic drugs) in the treatment of
post-menopausal osteoporotic women in Belgium
Adherence definition? Adherence was divided into compliance and persistence
Compliance: the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the
prescribed interval and dose of a dosing regimen. Often expressed as the
number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed (MPR)
Persistence: the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of
therapy. The proportion of patients receiving treatment at a given
time period
How was adherence
modelled?
Adherence to alendronate in a real-life setting was derived from a
Belgian study. It was divided into compliance and persistence
Persistence: 42.5% of those who initiated treatment discontinued within
6 months. These were given no treatment benefit but incurred 3 months’
treatment cost. Another 18.1%, 8.3%, 5.6% and 4.1% were dropped
off therapy at 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years and 2.5 years, respectively.
Patients discontinuing therapy received no further treatment
Compliance: patients were considered compliant if their MPR was
≥ 80%. The probabilities of being less than 80% compliant were 23.9%,
4% and 1.2% in the first, second and following years of therapy,
respectively. From the Belgian study, poor compliance was associated
with an increased fracture rate of 35% for hip fractures. From an
alternative source, it was assumed that for non-hip fractures the increase
in fracture rate would only be 17%. The relative risks of fracture from the
meta-analysis were associated with a population with a MPR of ≥ 80%,
so if alendronate was assumed to reduce the risk of hip fracture by 38%
then non-compliant women would receive a reduction in hip fractures of
16% (0.62 × 1.35 = 0.837). For poorly compliant women, the drug cost
was restricted to 80% of full price
Sensitivity analysis was done on reducing poor compliance and
discontinuation rates by 25%

but did not take any medication
How was adherence
modelled?
Adherence to alendronate in a real-life setting was derived from a
Belgian study. It was divided into compliance, persistence, and
primary non-adherence
Primary non-adherence: estimated at 11.6%. These only incurred the

Study Question Summary
Persistence: 42.5% of those who initiated treatment discontinued within
6 months. These were given no treatment benefit but incurred 3 months
treatment cost. Another 18.1%, 13.9% and 7.2% were dropped off
therapy at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively. Patients discontinuing
therapy received no further treatment
Compliance: patients were considered compliant if their MPR was
≥ 80%. The probabilities of being less than 80% compliant were 23.9%,
4% and 1.2% in the first, second and following years of therapy,
respectively. From the Belgian study, poor compliance was associated
with an increased fracture rate of 35% for hip fractures. From an
alternative source, it was assumed that for non-hip fractures the increase
in fracture rate would only be 17%. The relative risks of fracture from the
meta-analysis were associated with a population with a MPR of ≥ 80%,
so if alendronate was assumed to reduce the risk of hip fracture by 38%
then non-compliant women would receive a reduction in hip fractures of
16% (0.62 × 1.35 = 0.837). For poorly compliant women, the drug cost
was restricted to 80% of full price
Sensitivity analysis: because the adherence rates varied by region,
additional analyses were conducted assuming that adherence rates were
20% and 40% higher than in the real-world scenario

Study Question Summary
Primary non-adherence: if patients are prescribed a drug and never fill
the prescription they are termed a primary non-adherent
How was adherence
modelled?
Patients on treatment were classified as fully adherent or partially
adherent. A fully adherent patient would receive treatment for the
prescription duration. These patients received the expected treatment
benefit of a fully compliant patient. A partially adherent patient was at
risk of dropping out of treatment and had only a fraction of the benefit
that a fully compliant patient would have
The risk of dropping out of treatment would apply within the first 3 years;
thereafter, persistence would be stable. Non-parametric dropout rates
were obtained from a US database. A sensitivity analysis of different rates
for different parts of the world was conducted. If a patient dropped out
within 6 months, they received no treatment benefit but the cost of
physician visits, BMD measurements and 3 months of drug costs
were incurred
It is stated that in most large clinical trials, ≥ 80% of patients are persistent
until end of trial, but no adjustments were made here for the adherent
group because of its conceptual context
Using MPR as a measure of compliance, studies have estimated differences
in fracture rates between compliant and non-compliant patients to range
between 16% and 44%. However, non-compliant patients have higher
comorbidities, are more frail, and have higher medical expenditure than
compliant patients and fracture rates are higher in non-compliant patients
taking placebo. As these estimates are seldom controlled for clinical risk
factors, a base-case fraction of the benefit of 80% was assumed and
sensitivity analysis was done between 0% and 100%
Primary adherence was set to 4%. They were assumed to incur the cost of
one physician visit and one BMD measurement

Appendix 6 Final protocol
1. Title of the project:
Bone turnover markers for monitoring the response to osteoporosis treatment: the secondary prevention of
fractures, and primary prevention of fractures in high risk groups.
2. Name of TAR team and ‘lead’
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group,
University of York.
Summary
Bone turnover markers may be useful for identifying patients with osteoporosis who are not responding to
treatment, which in turn will allow changes in management or treatment strategies to be implemented
in a timely manner to ensure maximum benefit to the patient. An evidence synthesis using systematic
review methodology will be used to investigate potential uses of bone turnover markers, and a decision
analytical model developed if sufficient evidence is found to establish clinical effectiveness.
5. Decision problem
The review of the clinical evidence will focus on three key clinical areas:
l Clinical effectiveness: how does bone marker monitoring impact on the decision making process
and patient outcomes?
l Test accuracy: how well do the results of the biomarker tests correlate with changes in bone density,
architecture and incidence of fracture?
l Test reliability and reproducibility: how much do the results of tests vary within and between patients?
If clinical effectiveness can be established, a decision modelling will be developed and a expected value of
perfect information (EVPI) analysis undertaken. Any EVPI analysis is dependent on the ability to undertake
decision modelling. The decision model will focus on the effect of bone marker testing on patient
management decisions, and will address the question: ‘Which monitoring regimen is the most cost-effective
in informing treatment decision.’ The treatments being considered are bisphosphonates (oral and
intravenous), raloxifene, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, denosumab and no treatment.
6. Objectives
The primary aims of the systematic review are to determine the clinical effectiveness, test accuracy,
test reliability and test reproducibility, of bone turner markers in people being treated with any
bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, denosumab or teriparatide for osteoporosis. If possible,
a decision model will be developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for
monitoring treatment response and making changes in patient management. If a decision model is
produced, EVPI analyses will be used to determine the need for further research, identify the research
questions critical to decision making, and help inform the design of future studies and to consider
implementation issues.

7. Methods of synthesising evidence of clinical effectiveness
The review will be conducted systematically following the general principles recommended in CRD
guidance for undertaking reviews in health care62 and the PRISMA statement.63
Search strategy
The following databases will be searched to identify primary studies, relevant reviews and
economic studies:
l CINAHL
l Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Reviews of
Abstracts of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation
Database (NHS EED), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials)
l EconLit
l EMBASE
l MEDLINE
l Science Citation Index
The following sources will be searched to identify grey literature and ongoing research:
l Clinical Trials.gov
l Conference Proceedings Citation Index - – Science
l Controlled Clinical Trials.com
A draft search strategy for use with MEDLINE is provided in Appendix 1. No language or date restrictions
will be applied during the search. Additional searches will be conducted as required.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Population
Studies eligible for inclusion will be those in adults (> 18 years of age) either:
l Receiving any bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, denosumab or teriparatide for the
secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures, regardless of the baseline pathology, or
l In any high-risk group being treated with any bisphosphonate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate,
denosumab or teriparatide for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
Interventions
P1NP (serum), CTX (urinary and serum), NTX (urinary and serum), and BAP (serum).
Study designs
Effectiveness: RCTs where patients are randomised to a standard monitoring regimen (with or without
DXA), or to standard monitoring regimen with additional monitoring with a bone turnover marker. Studies
reporting the impact of bone marker test results on the decision making process for management of
osteoporosis, that also report the subsequent rate of fracture in the population being assessed, will also be
sought (‘Decision studies’).
Test accuracy: Studies comparing the results of bone marker tests to the results of bone biopsy or a
composite reference standard of DXA and subsequent fracture outcome will be included. Given the nature
of the review question, we believe it is unlikely that such studies will be available. So in addition we will
include prospective studies that measure the association between bone turnover and bone density and/or
fracture rates, and that report a correlation coefficient for this association. Prospective studies that evaluate
changes in bone biomarkers in patients receiving one of the specified osteoporosis treatments, that
APPENDIX 6
176
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

provide sufficient data to produce a measure of the risk of fracture, or that report the results of
multivariate regression analyses in which a biomarker of interest is an independent variable, will also be
eligible for inclusion.
Reliability and reproducibility: Prospective controlled studies of serial bone marker measurements that
report a measure of within and/or between patient variability, will be included.
Studies assessing the effectiveness of treatments for osteoporosis using changes in bone turnover
biomarkers solely as an outcome will be excluded. Prognostic studies using biomarkers to identify patients
at risk of osteoporosis and fracture at baseline, prior to commencing treatment, will also be excluded.
Outcomes
Effectiveness
RCTs and decision studies reporting either change in patient management strategies, the incidence of
fracture and/or treatment adherence rates.
Test accuracy
Studies will have to report either:
Estimates of diagnostic accuracy or sufficient data for these to be calculated
A correlation coefficient, or sufficient data for this to be calculated, for the association between a bone
turnover marker and bone density and/or the incidence of fracture
The risk/incidence of fracture associated with the bone marker test results
At least a p-value for a bone marker of interest that is used as an independent variable in a
multivariate regression.
Reliability and reproducibility
Studies reporting a measure for intra- and/or inter-patient variability in bone marker test results.
Data extraction strategy
Data extraction will be conducted by one reviewer using a standardised data extraction form and checked by
a second reviewer. Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer when
necessary. If time constraints allow, attempts will be made to contact authors for missing data. Data from
multiple publications of the same study will be extracted and reported as a single study. Where applicable
and available, extraction will include data on: study details (e.g. study identifier/EndNote ID, author, year,
country, setting, number of participants, and duration of follow up), patient characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
ethnicity, duration of osteoporosis, risk group, concomitant renal/liver disease; baseline P1NP, CTX and/or
NTX levels), details of intervention (serum or urine, sample collection details; pre-sampling preparations/
restrictions; sample storage details; assay used; adjustments for creatinine excretion; delay between sample
collection and assay; single/serial measures; thresholds/cut-offs/reference values), study quality, and reported
outcomes as specified above.
Quality assessment strategy
The quality of the individual studies will be assessed by one reviewer, and independently checked by a
second reviewer. Any disagreements will be resolved by consensus and if necessary a third reviewer will be
consulted. The quality of included studies will be assessed using standard checklists62 suitable for the study
design, and adapted as necessary to incorporate topic-specific quality issues.

Methods of analysis/synthesis
Key study characteristics, patient outcomes and study quality will be summarised in a narrative and tables.
Where appropriate, meta-analysis suitable to the data extracted will be employed to estimate a summary
measure of effect based on intention to treat analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity will explored:
l Subgroups of potential interest will be investigated if sufficient data are available, for example,
post-menopausal women (overall and for specific age ranges if data are available), elderly, skeletal site
(hip, spine, wrist)), and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
l Sensitivity analyses will be conducted, where appropriate, to investigate potential sources of
heterogeneity such as study quality, and differences in sample acquisition, storage and assay methods.
8. Methods of synthesising evidence of cost-effectiveness
• Identifying and systematically reviewing published
cost-effectiveness studies
Systematic searches will be undertaken to identify existing published studies reporting the cost-effectiveness
of bone-turnover markers for monitoring the response to osteoporosis treatment. The following databases
will be searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and EconLit. In addition, searches of NHS EED and HEED will
be carried out, along with a search of the Economics Working Papers archive (IDEAS).
Only full economic evaluations that compare two or more options, that meet the inclusion criteria for the
clinical review and consider both costs and consequences (including cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and
cost-benefit analyses), will be included in the review of economic literature.
The quality of the cost-effectiveness studies will be assessed according to a checklist updated from that
developed by Drummond et al. (2005)68 and Philips et al. (2002).499 This checklist will reflect the criteria for
economic evaluation detailed in the methodological guidance developed by the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence. This information will be tabulated and summarised within the text of the report.
In particular, information will be extracted on the comparators, study population, main analytic approaches
(e.g. patient-level analysis/decision-analytic modelling), primary outcome specified for the economic
analysis, details of adjustment for quality-of life, direct costs (medical and non-medical) and productivity
costs, estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness and approaches to quantifying decision uncertainty
(e.g. deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analysis).
The review will examine the full economic evaluations that meet the inclusion criteria in detail, with the
aim of identifying important structural assumptions, highlighting key areas of uncertainty and outlining the
potential issues of generalising from the results of existing economic evaluations.
• Development of a new decision-analytic model
If relevant effectiveness evidence can be identified (this may be in the form of an effect measure from an
RCT or an appropriate predictive value from a test accuracy study), a decision-analytic model will be
developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of bone turnover markers for monitoring treatment response
and informing changes in patient management. One possibility is to use an existing peer-reviewed decision
model developed by ScHARR (University of Sheffield) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis
interventions, using the most recent work undertaken.500 The model developer has agreed to provide access
to this model for the purposes of this project (Personal communication: Dr Matt Stevenson). However,
potential issues of academic in confidence data will need to be clarified before determining the final version
of the model which will be used. If monitoring clinical effectiveness data and adherence data are identified
then the Sheffield meta-model could be utilised.500 The Sheffield meta-model is a simpler summary model
of the original individual patient simulation (IPS) model. Cost data in the model will be updated using the
most contemporary estimates from national databases (e.g. reference costs), and a literature review will be
APPENDIX 6
178
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk

conducted to identify any relevant utility estimates in addition to those used in the existing model.
Discounting will be undertaken at an annual rate of 3.5% on costs and benefits.
If test accuracy data is available and it is possible to utilise these data in the original IPS model then this
will also be considered.500 Additional searching will be undertaken, if required, to identify relevant model
structures from published cost-effectiveness analyses. These will be used to help inform this adaption of
the IPS model. Further, if the use of the Sheffield model is not an option the published models identified
will be utilised in the development of a new decision model.
The presence of any data gaps (e.g. resource use data) that may need to be filled during the development
of the model will be identified from the literature identified during the systematic review process and
additional searches if required. The primary outcome of the model will be the cost-utility of different
monitoring strategies. The number of fractures prevented will also be reported. Cost-effectiveness will be
established by estimating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The number of fractures prevented will also
be reported. The risk-benefit uncertainties such as the clinical effect, adverse event and net-benefit
uncertainties, and the model assumptions will be presented clearly.
To consider future research priorities in the NHS, the model will also be used to undertake analyses of the
EVPI. Depending on whether a model is built on the fracture risk clinical effectiveness of monitoring
strategies or test accuracy, EVPI analyses will be conducted for the relevant data in the model. EVPI
represents the expected costs of decision uncertainty since perfect information would eliminate the
possibility of making the wrong decision. Hence, EVPI for the overall decision problem represents the value
of eliminating all uncertainty and EVPI for key parameters (termed partial EVPI) represents the value of
eliminating uncertainties in particular subsets of parameters. Separate analyses will be undertaken to reflect
the variability considered in the decision model itself if the model allows. Per patient EVPI estimates will be
scaled up to reflect the relevant UK population size and will adopt an appropriate time-horizon. EVPI also
represents the maximum amount that a decision-maker should be willing to pay for additional evidence to
inform this decision in the future. EVPI provides an upper bound on the value of additional research. The
objective of this analysis (termed partial EVPI) is to identify the model parameters where it would be most
worthwhile obtaining more precise estimates. The results from the clinical effectiveness review and the EVPI
results will be used to identify future research recommendations.
9.7 TAR Centre
The Technology Assessment Review team at the University of York is drawn from two specialist centres:
the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and the Centre for Health Economics (CHE). This
Technology Assessment will be conducted by CRD.
CRD undertakes reviews of research about the effects of interventions used in health and social care
(www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd). The centre maintains various databases, provides an enquiry service and
disseminates results of research to NHS decision makers.
Recent TARs undertaken by CRD/CHE at York relate to the identification of the seizure focus in patients
with refractory epilepsy being considered for surgery, aldosterone treatment for post-MI heart failure,
treatments for bipolar disorder, sugammadex for the reversal of muscle relaxation in general anaesthesia
and photodynamic therapy in the treatment of specified cancer sites.
