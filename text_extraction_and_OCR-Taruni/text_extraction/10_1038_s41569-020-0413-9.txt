Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported 
in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 (refs1–3
). Since 
then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and has 
become a global pandemic affecting >200 countries 
and territories, with an unprecedented effect not only 
on public health, but also social and economic activi￾ties. The exponential increase in the number of patients 
with COVID-19 in the past 6 months has overwhelmed 
health-care systems in numerous countries across the 
world. At present, preventive vaccines and prophylactic 
therapies for COVID-19 are not available.
COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syn￾drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a member 
of the genus Betacoronavirus like the two other coro￾naviruses that have caused pandemic diseases (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(MERS-CoV))1–4
. As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 
SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory infection, which leads 
to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) in some patients1
. However, in addition to res￾piratory symptoms, uncontrolled SARS-CoV-2 infection 
can trigger a cytokine storm, whereby pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines such as tumour necrosis 
factor-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are overproduced by the immune 
system, resulting in multiorgan damage5
. Furthermore, 
COVID-19 causes coagulation abnormalities in a sub￾stantial proportion of patients, which can lead to throm￾boembolic events6,7
. The genomic sequence1–3,8
 and viral 
protein structure9–11 of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied 
intensively since its emergence. To date, research shows 
that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with 
SARS-CoV owing to 79.6% genomic sequence identity1,2
. 
In particular, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the 
same system of cell entry, which is triggered by binding 
of the viral spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of the host cell4
.
Understanding the biological features of the virus 
will contribute to the development of diagnostic tests, 
vaccines and pharmacological therapies and can further 
our knowledge of tissue tropism. Early clinical data indi￾cate that both the susceptibility to and the outcomes of 
COVID-19 are strongly associated with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD)12–16. A high prevalence of pre-existing 
Acute respiratory distress

Abstract | Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a strain of coronavirus known as 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic 
that has affected the lives of billions of individuals. Extensive studies have revealed that 
SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV, the zoonotic virus that caused the 
2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, including the system of cell entry, which is 
triggered by binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical 
studies have also reported an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. 
Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk 
of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, 
arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism. Potential drug–disease 
interactions affecting patients with COVID-19 and comorbid cardiovascular diseases are also 
becoming a serious concern. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 
from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives, focusing on the interaction between COVID-19 
and the cardiovascular system. By combining our knowledge of the biological features of the virus 
with clinical findings, we can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying 
COVID-19, paving the way towards the development of preventative and therapeutic solutions.

CVD has been observed among patients with COVID-19, 
and these comorbidities are associated with increased 
mortality17–22. Furthermore, COVID-19 seems to pro￾mote the development of cardiovascular disorders, 
such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) and venous thromboembolism23–25. 
Children with COVID-19 have also been reported to 
develop hyperinflammatory shock with features akin 
to Kawasaki disease, including cardiac dysfunction and 
coronary vessel abnormalities26. Together, these data 
indicate the presence of a bidirectional interaction 
between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system, 
but the mechanisms underlying this interaction remain 
elusive. The high burden of systemic inflammation 
associated with COVID-19 has been proposed to accel￾erate the development of subclinical disorders or cause 
de novo cardiovascular damage5,12–14. ACE2, which is a 
key surface protein for virus entry and part of the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is also thought 
to be involved in this interaction on the basis of findings 
from animal models12–15.
The fast-moving nature of this research field neces￾sitates the integration of available biological data with 
clinical findings of COVID-19 to improve our under￾standing of the pathophysiology of the disease and to 
contribute to the development of potential therapies. 
In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge 
of SARS-CoV-2 from a biological viewpoint, with an 
emphasis on the interaction between the viral S protein 
and human ACE2. Furthermore, we provide an overview 
of the clinical findings related to the effects of COVID-19 
on the cardiovascular system. Finally, we discuss the 
possible link between common cardiovascular drugs 
and susceptibility to COVID-19 and the potential 
cardiovascular effects of drugs used to treat COVID-19.
Of note, several limitations of this Review need to 
be acknowledged. First, given the fast-moving nature 
of this research field, we will discuss and cite data from 
preprint reports on bioRxiv or medRxiv in addition to 
peer-reviewed articles that have cited preprint reports. 
These findings need to be interpreted with care and 
require validation in larger studies. Second, the major￾ity of clinical COVID-19 data mentioned in this Review 
are from China, given their early experience with the 
disease. Finally, the clinical data on COVID-19 are 
predominantly derived from non-randomized studies. 
Therefore, potential biases and confounding factors 
associated with observational data, such as differences in 
patient background, diagnostic methods and health-care 
systems, should be taken into account.
Biology of SARS-CoV-2
Genome, genes and proteins
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, extensive efforts 
have been made to characterize the features of this 
novel coronavirus through genomic sequence studies1–3
and the evaluation of viral protein structure9–11,27,28. 
Coronaviruses, which are a large family of single-stranded 
enveloped RNA viruses, were not recognized as being 
highly pathogenic in humans until the outbreak of SARS 
caused by SARS-CoV in 2002–2003 (refs29,30). A decade 
after the SARS pandemic, an outbreak of MERS was 
detected in Saudi Arabia, caused by MERS-CoV, another 
highly pathogenic coronavirus29. In the ensuing years, 
extensive studies of SARS and MERS have contributed to 
our understanding of coronavirus biology. On the basis 
of phylogenic analyses, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 
are thought to have originated in bats, which are likely to 
be a major natural reservoir of coronaviruses29. A num￾ber of genetically diverse coronaviruses that are related 
to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have been discovered in 
bats worldwide1,29,31. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to 
have 79.6% genomic sequence identity with SARS-CoV 
and 96.0% with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (refs1–3,8
). 
Given this genomic sequence homology, SARS-CoV-2 
is thought to share many biological features with 
SARS-CoV, suggesting that we can apply, at least in 
part, our rich knowledge of SARS-CoV biology and 
pathogenesis to understanding SARS-CoV-2 (refs4,29,30). 
For example, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use 
ACE2 as an attachment receptor to enter host cells, 
whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 as the 
attachment receptor1,2,29,30.
Coronaviruses have a crown-like morphology, con￾sisting of four structural proteins known as spike (S), 
envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) 
proteins29,30,32 (Fig. 1a). The viral genome surrounded 
by the N protein is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
that functions as both a genome and an mRNA29,30,32. 
Coronaviruses can be divided into four genera: α, β, γ 
and δ, of which only α and β-coronaviruses are known to 
infect humans. Phylogenetic studies have revealed that 
all three highly pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) belong to the genus 
Betacoronavirus1–3,29. Like other coronaviruses, the 
Key points
•	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that 
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), shares many biological features with 
SARS-CoV, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, owing to 80% 
genomic sequence identity.
•	The interaction between the viral spike (S) protein and angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2, which triggers entry of the virus into host cells, is likely to be involved 
in the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19.
•	The presence of underlying cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 
is associated with high mortality.
•	COVID-19 can cause cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial injury, 
arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism.
•	Several medications used for the treatment of COVID-19 have uncertain safety and 
efficacy profiles.
Tissue tropism
The ability of a given pathogen 
to infect specific cell or tissue 
types of a host.
Kawasaki disease
An acute febrile illness of 
unknown cause that primarily 
affects children aged <5 years 
and can cause coronary artery 
aneurysms.
Positive-sense, 
single-stranded RNA

known as plus-strand RNA, 
that can be directly translated 
to a sequence of amino acids to 
synthesize proteins without a 
complementary RNA 
intermediate.

Fig. 1 | Structure, genome and life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. a | Corona￾viruses form an enveloped spherical particle that consists of four struc￾tural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid 
(N)) and a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome that is 
30kb in length. b | The 5′-terminal two-thirds of the severe acute respira￾tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome encodes poly￾proteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved into 16 different non￾structural proteins. Structural proteins are encoded in the 3′-terminal 
one-third of the genome. The S protein consists of two subunits; the 
S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells, 
whereas the S2 subunit mediates fusion between the membranes 
of the virus and the host cell. Compared with the S protein of SARS-CoV, 
the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has two notable features. First, within the 
RBD of the S1 subunit, five of the six residues that are crucial for binding 
to human ACE2 are mutated. Second, an insertion of four amino acid 
residues at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits is present 
in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV, which introduces a novel furin 
cleavage site. c | SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by the binding of the 
S protein to ACE2 on the surface of host cells, and the viral complex is 
incorporated into the cytoplasm either by direct fusion with the cell 
membrane or via endocytosis with later release into the cytoplasm from 
the endocytic vesicle. The S protein is cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary 
and the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion. The viral genome 
RNA is released into the cytoplasm, and the first open reading frame 
(ORF) is translated into polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are then 
cleaved by viral proteases into small, non-structural proteins such as RNA￾dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The viral genomic RNA is replicated 
by RdRP. Viral nucleocapsids are assembled from genomic RNA and 
N proteins in the cytoplasm, whereas budding of new particles occurs 
at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermedi￾ate compartment. Finally, the genomic RNA and structural proteins are 
assembled into new viral particles, leading to their release via exocytosis.

genome of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 30kb in length 
and contains ten open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 
24–27 genes1,2
. The 5′-terminal two-thirds of the genome 
encodes polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved 
into 16 non-structural proteins, such as RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRP). The S, E, M and N structural 
proteins are encoded in the 3′-terminal one-third of the 
genome29,30,33 (Fig. 1b).
Among the structural proteins, the S protein has 
pivotal roles in virus attachment and entry and disease 
pathogenesis9–11,29,30. In SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, 
the binding of the viral S protein to ACE2 triggers 
virus entry into the host cell. Therefore, the interaction 
between the S protein and ACE2 has been considered to 
be a promising therapeutic target for the development 
of vaccines34,35, neutralizing antibodies36,37 and antiviral 
compounds38,39 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The 
sequence similarity between the S protein of SARS-CoV 
and that of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 76% for the 
whole protein, 73% for the receptor-binding domain and 
50% for the receptor-binding motif11.
The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains two dis￾tinctive features that are not present in the S protein of 
SARS-CoV4,8
. First, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 main￾tains a high binding affinity to human ACE2 even though 
five of the six residues present in the SARS-CoV recep￾tor binding motif that are critical for binding to human 
ACE2 are mutated in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 
(L455, F486, Q493, S494 and N501)4,8
. Cryogenic elec￾tron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the 
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind directly to human 
ACE2 with a similar or even higher affinity than that 
of SARS-CoV9–11. This high binding affinity is likely to 
be related to the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 
and the severity of COVID-19. Second, the S protein 
of SARS-CoV-2 has an insertion of four amino acid 
residues (12 nucleotides) at the boundary between 
the S1 and S2 subunits, which introduces a novel 
furin cleavage site4,8
. This novel cleavage site has not been 
observed in SARS-CoV or other SARS-related corona￾viruses originating from bats and seems to facilitate the 
processing of S protein at the S1 and S2 subunit bound￾ary by ubiquitously expressed furin-like proteases for 
preliminary activation4
. Although the function of this 
novel cleavage site is unknown, similar cleavage sites 
have been described in highly pathogenic avian influenza 
viruses and the Newcastle disease virus4,8
. This notable 
feature has been proposed to have a role in expanding 
cell or tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 (ref.4
), contributing 
to the multiorgan effects of COVID-19 (Fig. 1b).
Life cycle of the virus
Infection with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 
involves binding of the viral S protein to ACE2 on the 
surface of the host cell. The receptor-binding domain 
on the surface subunit S1 of the S protein is responsi￾ble for attachment of the virus to ACE2. After binding, 
the S protein is cleaved at the S1/2 and S2′ regions (in 
a process known as S protein priming) by the trans￾membrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which in turn 
facilitates the fusion of the viral membrane with the 
membrane of the host cell and direct entry of the virus 
into the cytoplasm4,29,30,40 (Fig. 1c). Respiratory tract 
epithelial cells express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on 
their surface, and this direct or ‘early’ entry pathway 
seems to be the predominant mode of in vivo entry by 
SARS-CoV and, probably, SARS-CoV-2 into the respira￾tory tissue40. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can also use an 
endosomal entry pathway, whereby the ACE2–virus 
complex is translocated to endosomes and S protein 
priming is performed by the endosomal cysteine pro￾teases cathepsin B and cathepsin L, after which the 
virus is released from the endosome into the cytoplasm. 
This endosomal entry pathway, which can be blocked 
by either lysosomotropic agents (such as hydroxychlo￾roquine) or cathepsin inhibitors, might be the pre￾dominant entry pathway used by coronaviruses in the 
infection of cells cultured in vitro40, but the importance 
of this pathway for infection in vivo remains unclear. 
After the release of the viral genomic RNA into the 
cytoplasm, the first ORF is translated into polyproteins 
pp1a and pp1ab, which are then cleaved by viral pro￾teases into small non-structural proteins such as RdRP. 
The viral genomic RNA is then replicated using viral 
RdRP, and the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) 
are translated through the endoplasmic reticulum and 
Golgi complex of the host cell. Finally, the genomic RNA 
and structural proteins are assembled into new viral 
particles, leading to their release through exocytosis29,30
(Fig. 1c). Each step of the viral life cycle described here is a 
potential therapeutic target, including S protein priming 
by TMPRSS2 (a target of the serine protease inhibitor 
camostat mesylate), membrane fusion and endocyto￾sis (a target of the antimalarial drug chloroquine and 
anti-influenza drug umifenovir) and RNA replication 
by RdRP (a target of the antiviral agents favipiravir, 
remdesivir and ribavirin)41,42.
The cardiovascular system and COVID-19
Underlying cardiovascular comorbidities
CVD is a common comorbidity observed in patients 
infected with SARS or MERS (with a prevalence of 10% 
and 30%, respectively)12–14,43,44. A series of reports on 
the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 
have also described similar findings12–15. Early reports 
from China found that CVD and its risk factors, such 
as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, were common 
pre-existing conditions in patients with COVID-19, 
but the definition of CVD used in each study was 
vague17,18,21,22,45 (Table 1). In an early report from Wuhan 
involving 41  patients who were hospitalized with 
COVID-19 by 2 January 2020, the prevalence of any 
comorbidity was 32% and the most common under￾lying diseases were diabetes (20%), hypertension 
(15%) and other CVDs (15%)17. The high prevalence 
of these comorbidities was confirmed in subsequent 
studies18–22,45–47. Importantly, the prevalence of these 
pre-existing conditions was higher in critically ill patients 
(such as those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)) 
and in those who died. In a single-centre cohort study 
of 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 
46% of patients had any comorbidity (72% of patients 
in the ICU), 31% of patients had hypertension (58% of 
patients in the ICU), 15% of patients had other CVDs

(25% of patients in the ICU) and 10% of patients had 
diabetes (22% of patients in the ICU)18. Similarly, in a 
multicentre cohort study involving 191 patients hos￾pitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 48% of patients 
had any comorbidity (67% of those who died), 30% of 
patients had hypertension (48% of those who died), 
19% of patients had diabetes (31% of those who died) 
and 8% of patients had coronary heart disease (24% of 
those who died)19. Furthermore, in a report involving 
1,099 patients with COVID-19 from mainland China, 
24% of patients had any comorbidity (39% of critically 
ill patients), 15% of patients had hypertension (24% 
of critically ill patients), 7% of patients had diabetes 
(16% of critically ill patients) and 3% of patients had 
coronary heart disease (6% of critically ill patients)20. 
The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 reported by the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as of 
11 February 2020 was 2.3% (1,023 deaths among 44,672 
confirmed cases)21,45. The individual case fatality rate of 
patients with CVD was 10.5% (highest among those with 
any comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease 
(6.3%) or cancer (5.6%)), the case fatality rate of patients 
with diabetes was 7.3% and that of patients with hyper￾tension was 6.0%45. Of note, these early approximations 
of case fatality rate are likely to be overestimated given 
that the estimates did not account for the many people 
who had the virus but were not tested.
A similar trend in the prevalence of comorbidities has 
been reported by researchers in other countries46–51. In 
a report involving 1,591 patients with COVID-19 who 
were admitted to the ICU in Italy, 49% of patients had 
pre-existing hypertension, 21% had CVD and 17% 
had diabetes46. Furthermore, in a report of 393 con￾secutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New 
York, USA, up to 50% of patients had hypertension 
(54% of ventilated patients), 36% had obesity (43% of 
ventilated patients), 25% of patients had diabetes (28% 
of ventilated patients) and 14% of patients had coronary 
artery disease (19% of ventilated patients)47. Of note, this 
study from New York highlighted the high prevalence 
of comorbid obesity among patients with COVID-19, 
which had not been reported in the studies on patients in 
China probably owing to differences in the background 
prevalence of obesity between the USA and China. 
Investigators in this study suggest that obesity might 
also be a risk factor for respiratory failure and the need 
for invasive mechanical ventilation47.
Diverse cardiovascular manifestations
Although the predominant clinical manifestation of 
COVID-19 is viral pneumonia1,2,48,49, COVID-19 can 
also cause cardiovascular disorders such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, ACS and thromboembolism12–15
(Fig. 2). Some patients who present without the typical 
symptoms of fever or cough have cardiac symptoms as 
the first clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (refs52,53). 
Myocardial injury during the course of COVID-19 
is independently associated with high mortality23. 
Furthermore, a possible link between COVID-19 and 
a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome has been described 
in children26.
Myocardial injury and myocarditis. Acute myocar￾dial injury, as evidenced by elevated levels of cardiac 
biomarkers or electrocardiogram abnormalities, was 
observed in 7–20% of patients with COVID-19 in early 
studies in China17–21. The presence of myocardial injury 
was associated with a significantly worse prognosis23. 
In the initial report of 41 patients with COVID-19 in 
Wuhan, 5 patients had myocardial injury with elevated 
levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (>28pg/ml), 
and 4 of these 5 patients were admitted to an ICU17. In a 
multicentre cohort study of 191 patients with COVID-19, 
33 patients (17%) had acute cardiac injury, of whom 
32 died19. In a subsequent study of 416 patients hospi￾talized with COVID-19, 82 patients (20%) had evidence 
of cardiac injury, which was associated with a 5-fold 
increase in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation 
and an 11-fold increase in mortality23. Of note, cardiac 
injury was found to be an independent risk factor for in￾hospital mortality23. Another study confirmed this find￾ing and reported that the rate of death in patients with 
elevated levels of cardiac troponin T was 37.5%, whereas, 
in patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidi￾ties plus elevated levels of cardiac troponin T, it was 
almost double (69.4%)24. Furthermore, a subsequent 
study demonstrated that markers of myocardial injury 
were predictive of the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.25). The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of the initial 
cardiac troponin I level for predicting in-hospital mor￾tality was as high as 0.92. Other predictors of myocardial 
injury include advanced age, presence of comorbidities 
and high levels of C-reactive protein.
Whether typical clinical features of myocarditis were 
present in patients who had elevated levels of cardiac 
troponins during the course of COVID-19 is unclear 
because most of the early studies did not include echo￾cardiography or MRI data12–14,54. In a cohort study involv￾ing 112 patients with COVID-19, the 14 patients with 
myocardial injury who had elevated high-sensitivity lev￾els of cardiac troponin I (>0.12ng/ml) plus abnormalities

on echocardiography and/or electrocardiogram did not 
have typical signs of myocarditis such as segmental wall 
motion abnormality or reduced left ventricular (LV) 
ejection fraction (LVEF), suggesting that myocardial 
injury was secondary to systemic causes rather than 
a result of direct viral infection of the heart53. By con￾trast, several case reports have described typical signs 
of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. A woman 
aged 53 years with myocardial injury, as evidenced by 
elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers and diffuse ST seg￾ment elevation on the electrocardiogram, had diffuse 
biventricular hypokinesis on cardiac MRI, especially in 
the apical segments, in addition to severe LV dysfunc￾tion (LVEF = 35%)55. MRI data also revealed marked 
biventricular interstitial oedema, diffuse late gadolin￾ium enhancement and circumferential pericardial effu￾sion, features that are consistent with acute myocarditis. 
Furthermore, in a man aged 37 years with chest pain 
and ST segment elevation, echocardiography revealed 
an enlarged heart (LV diastolic dimension=58mm) and 
LV dysfunction (LVEF=27%)56. This patient was diag￾nosed with COVID-19-induced fulminant myocarditis 
and treated with methylprednisolone. Cardiac size and 
function recovered to normal after 1 week (LV diastolic 
dimension=42mm, LVEF=66%).
Histological evidence of myocardial injury or myo￾carditis in COVID-19 is also limited. An autopsy of a 
patient with COVID-19 and ARDS who died of a sud￾den cardiac arrest showed no evidence of myocardial 
structural involvement, suggesting that COVID-19 did 
not directly impair the heart57. By contrast, another case 
report described a patient with low-grade myocardial 
inflammation and myocardial localization of coronavi￾rus particles (outside of cardiomyocytes), as measured 
by endomyocardial biopsy, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 
might infect the myocardium directly58. Autopsy reports

Fig. 2 | Bidirectional interaction between cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19. Cardiovascular comorbidities such 
as hypertension and coronary artery disease are associated with high mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have numerous effects that might influence susceptibility to or the severity of 
COVID-19. Furthermore, although the main presentation of COVID-19 is viral pneumonia, COVID-19 can also induce 
cardiovascular manifestations including myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and 
thromboembolism. Among these cardiovascular manifestations, myocardial injury has been independently associated 
with high mortality among patients with COVID-19 (ref.23). Finally, medications that have been proposed as treatments for 
COVID-19 such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have pro-arrhythmic effects. AF, atrial fibrillation; VF, ventricular

have also revealed the presence of mild inflammation 
and viral RNA in the hearts of patients with COVID-19 
(refs59,60). However, whether these patients had myo￾carditis or whether the findings were a consequence of 
systemic inflammation remains unclear.
Our understanding of the pathophysiology underly￾ing SARS might help to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 
can infect cardiac cells directly, given that SARS-CoV and 
SARS-CoV-2 share the same mechanisms of entry into 
the host cell4,12,43 and that the heart expresses high levels of 
ACE2 (refs15,61). In a report that described autopsy samples 
from ten Canadian patients with SARS, the viral RNA of 
SARS-CoV was detected in 35% of the heart samples, but 
the infected cell types were unknown62. A marked increase 
in macrophage infiltration with evidence of myocardial 
damage was also detected, suggesting that SARS-CoV 
can infect the heart directly62.
Taken together, these findings suggest that myo￾cardial injury is not only a common manifestation of 
COVID-19, but also a risk factor for poor prognosis. 
At present, we do not understand the mechanisms under￾lying COVID-19-related myocardial injury. However, on 
the basis of the available clinical evidence, myocardial 
injury seems to be largely attributable to advanced sys￾temic inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 might also infect the 
myocardium directly, resulting in viral myocarditis in a 
small proportion of patients with COVID-19.
Acute coronary syndrome. As with other infectious dis￾eases, including SARS and influenza, COVID-19 can 
trigger ACS44,63–66. In early studies from China, a small 
proportion of patients with COVID-19 presented with 
chest pain on admission to hospital, but the charac￾teristics of the chest pain were not described17,18. In a 
case series from New York involving 18 patients with 
COVID-19 and ST segment elevation, which is indica￾tive of potential acute myocardial infarction, five of the 
six patients with myocardial infarction required percuta￾neous coronary intervention66. In a case series from Italy 
involving 28 patients with COVID-19 and ST segment 
elevation myocardial infarction, assessment by coro￾nary angiography showed that 17 patients had evidence 
of a culprit lesion that required revascularization52. Of 
note, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction was 
the first clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in 24 of 
these 28 patients who had not yet received a positive 
test result for COVID-19 at the time of coronary angi￾ography. These observations suggest that COVID-19 
can cause ACS even in the absence of substantial sys￾temic inflammation. However, the incidence of ACS in 
patients with COVID-19 is still unknown. Considering 
the overwhelmed health-care facilities of many cities 
during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of cases 
of acute myocardial infarction among patients with 
COVID-19 might be underestimated in early studies. 
The mechanisms underlying COVID-19-induced ACS 
might involve plaque rupture, coronary spasm or micro￾thrombi owing to systemic inflammation or cytokine 
storm67,68. For example, activated macrophages secrete 
collagenases that degrade collagen, a major constituent 
of the fibrous cap on atherosclerotic plaques, which can 
lead to plaque rupture67. Activated macrophages are also 
known to secrete tissue factor, a potent procoagulant that 
triggers thrombus formation when the plaque ruptures67. 
Direct endothelial or vascular injury caused by SARS￾CoV-2 infection might also increase the risk of thrombus 
formation and ACS69.
Despite the potential for COVID-19 to induce ACS, 
the number of reported cases of ACS during the COVID-19 
outbreak in Italy, Spain and the USA was actually sig￾nificantly lower than during pre-COVID-19 periods, 
with a reported 42–48% reduction in hospitalizations 
for ACS and a 38–40% reduction in percutaneous cor￾onary interventions for ST segment elevation myo￾cardial infarction70–73. By contrast, the incidence of 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increased during the 
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, which was strongly associ￾ated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (ref.74). 
This observation is in accordance with the finding that 
the number of patients with myocardial infarction 
seeking urgent hospital care declined by >50% during 
the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, as reported in an 
extensive global survey by the ESC75.
Heart failure. In an early study from Wuhan involving 
799 patients, heart failure was one of the most commonly 
observed complications of COVID-19, with a reported 
incidence of 24% in all patients and 49% in patients who 
died76. Elevated levels of amino-terminal pro-B-type 
natriuretic peptide were identified in 49% of all patients 
(85% of those who died)76. Similarly, in another study 
of 191 patients in Wuhan, heart failure was identified 
in 23% of all patients and in 52% of patients who died19.
The aetiology of acute or decompensated heart fail￾ure in COVID-19 has not been studied77. Given that 
patients with COVID-19 are likely to be older and to 
have pre-existing comorbidities such as coronary artery 
disease, hypertension and diabetes, heart failure might 
be the result of an exacerbation of these pre-existing 
conditions, whether already diagnosed or unknown, 
or the uncovering of subclinical cardiac dysfunction. 
In particular, elderly patients with reduced diastolic func￾tion might develop heart failure with preserved EF dur￾ing the course of COVID-19, which can be triggered by 
high fever, tachycardia, excessive hydration and impaired 
renal function77. In patients with heart failure with pre￾served ejection fraction, cardiac MRI might help to detect 
changes induced by COVID-19 (refs78,79). Acute myo￾cardial injury and ACS triggered by COVID-19 can also 
aggravate pre-existing heart disease or provoke contrac￾tile dysfunction. In the advanced stages of COVID-19, the 
response of the immune system to infection might trig￾ger the development of stress-induced cardiomyopathy 
or cytokine-related myocardial dysfunction, as with 
sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction80,81.
Given that COVID-19 primarily causes respira￾tory symptoms and viral pneumonia with bilateral, 
peripheral and lower lung distribution, the pulmonary 
oedema that is observed in these patients, which is 
usually accompanied by ARDS, is mainly regarded as 
non-cardiogenic. However, given that approximately 
25% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 develop 
heart failure, the potential contribution of pulmo￾nary congestion by heart failure should be taken into 
NAture RevIeWS | CARDIOLOGy

consideration77. Additional haemodynamic data from 
patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure are 
needed to validate this involvement.
Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. Arrhythmias 
and sudden cardiac arrest are common manifestations of 
COVID-19. Heart palpitations have been reported to be 
the main presenting symptom of COVID-19 in patients 
without a fever or cough82. In a cohort of 138 patients with 
COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, the presence of cardiac 
arrhythmia was reported in 17% of all patients (44% of 
patients in the ICU), but the specific types of arrhythmia 
were not recorded18. In another study in Wuhan involv￾ing 187 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those with 
elevated levels of troponin T were more likely to develop 
malignant arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia 
and fibrillation, than those with normal levels of troponin 
T (12% versus 5%)24. In-hospital and out-of-hospital sud￾den cardiac arrests have also been reported in patients 
with COVID-19 (refs57,66,74). However, the exact contribu￾tion of COVID-19 to cardiac arrhythmias remains uncer￾tain given that arrhythmias, such as atrial and ventricular 
tachycardia and fibrillation, can be triggered by myocar￾dial injury or other systemic causes such as fever, sepsis, 
hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities24,83. Furthermore, 
patients with advanced COVID-19 are often treated with 
antiviral medications and antibiotics that are known 
to induce arrhythmias in some patients (described in 
detail below)13,41.
Coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis. COVID-19 
is associated with coagulation abnormalities, which 
can result in thromboembolic events73. Patients with 
COVID-19 often have elevated levels of d-dimer, 
modestly reduced platelet counts and slightly prolonged 
prothrombin time. In an early study of 1,099 patients 
with COVID-19 from China, elevated levels of d-dimer 
(>0.5mg/l) were observed in 46% of all patients (60% of 
those with severe illness)20. Similarly, another study in 
patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan showed that d-dimer 
levels were elevated (>1mg/l) in 42% of all patients (81% 
of those who died), which, if detected at admission to 
hospital, was associated with an 18-fold increased risk of 
death19. By contrast, the changes in platelet counts and 
prothrombin time were modest. Among 41 patients with 
COVID-19 in Wuhan, only 5% had a low platelet count 
(<100×109
 cells per litre) and the prolongation of pro￾thrombin time was mild even in patients admitted to the 
ICU (11.1s versus 12.2s)17. Moreover, levels of fibrinogen 
and factor VIII were elevated in these patients, indicating 
a hypercoagulable state84,85. These findings show that a 
substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19 have 
coagulation abnormalities that typically do not meet the 
criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation estab￾lished by the International Society on Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis86, but nevertheless might contribute to the 
development of the diverse cardiovascular manifestations 
of COVID-19.
Clinical observations of increased thromboembolic 
events in patients with COVID-19 suggest the presence 
of a hypercoagulable state. Venous thromboembolism, 
which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism, is a common complication in critically ill 
patients with COVID-19. An autopsy study revealed that 
deep vein thrombosis was present in 7 of 12 patients who 
died with COVID-19 in whom venous thromboembo￾lism was not suspected before death, whereas pulmo￾nary embolism was identified in 4 of the 12 patients59. 
Arterial thrombotic events have also been reported. 
A case series from New York described five patients 
aged ≤50 years who presented to the same hospital 
with large-vessel ischaemic stroke and who all tested 
positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection87. Furthermore, 
acute limb ischaemia was also reported in 20 patients 
with COVID-19 (90% men, mean age 75±9 years) in a 
case series from Italy88. All 20 patients were diagnosed 
with COVID-19-related pneumonia before acute limb 
ischaemia was detected.
The mechanisms underlying these coagulation 
abnormalities, particularly hypercoagulation, in the 
setting of COVID-19 are unclear. One hypothesis is 
that the severe inflammatory response and endothelial 
damage induced by COVID-19 in combination with 
underlying comorbidities might predispose patients 
to a hypercoagulable state6
. Of note, certain antiviral 
medications and investigational therapies given to these 
patients might promote thrombosis or bleeding events 
through drug–drug interactions with antiplatelet agents 
and anticoagulants41.
A retrospective study in New York showed that sys￾temic anticoagulation was associated with prolonged 
survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ref.89). 
Among 2,773 patients, 786 (28%) received systemic 
anticoagulation. The median survival time of patients 
who were treated with anticoagulation was longer than 
in those who were not treated (21 days versus 14 days), 
although overall mortality between the two groups 
remained similar (22.5% versus 22.8%)89. The differ￾ences in median survival time and mortality were more 
pronounced among patients who required mechanical 
ventilation (21 days versus 9 days and 29.1% versus 
62.7%, respectively)89. Another retrospective study in 
China also showed reduced mortality in patients with 
COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who were treated 
with prophylactic heparin90. Importantly, findings from 
these retrospective studies are limited by potential selec￾tion bias, the presence of confounding factors and the 
undefined indication of anticoagulation treatment. In 
addition, the optimal anticoagulation agent to prevent 
thromboembolic events in these patients is not known 
(for example, low-molecular-weight heparin, unfrac￾tionated heparin, direct oral anticoagulants or others). 
Prospective, randomized trials are needed to validate the 
protective effect of anticoagulation therapy in patients 
with COVID-19.
Kawasaki disease. Children are thought to be less sus￾ceptible than adults to COVID-19, and the majority of 
children with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or present 
with only mild symptoms91. However, COVID-19 has 
been reported to cause severe inflammatory symptoms 
in a small proportion of paediatric patients26,92. A case 
series from the UK reported an unprecedented cluster 
of eight children (aged 4–14 years) presenting with a

hyperinflammatory syndrome with features of Kawasaki 
disease, five of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or 
were potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from family 
members26. Clinical presentations included fever, variable 
rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, extremity pain 
and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. A common find￾ing on echocardiography was echo-bright coronary ves￾sels, which progressed to a giant coronary aneurysm in 
one patient. Furthermore, researchers in Bergamo, Italy, 
found a 30-fold increase in the incidence of Kawasaki￾like disease among children during the peak of the 
pandemic92. These paediatric patients were older and 
had a higher rate of cardiac involvement than patients 
diagnosed with Kawasaki disease before the pandemic. 
Together, these early clinical findings are suggestive of 
a new phenomenon caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection 
in children that can lead to a hyperinflammatory syn￾drome with features that are similar to those of Kawasaki 
disease, including coronary artery abnormalities.
Immunocompromised patients
In general, patients with depressed immunity are at a 
higher risk of infectious diseases. The effect of COVID-19 
on the cardiovascular system in immunocompromised 
patients, such as those with cancer or those who have 
undergone organ transplantation, is largely unknown. 
Heart transplantation recipients might be at higher 
risk of COVID-19 owing to their immunosuppressed 
state combined with their baseline cardiovascular 
disorders14,93. COVID-19 has been reported in two 
heart transplantation recipients from China, both of 
whom made a full recovery94. The clinical presenta￾tions of these two patients were not distinct from those 
of non-immunosuppressed patients. In a retrospec￾tive case series of heart transplantation recipients with 
COVID-19 admitted to hospitals in Michigan, USA, 
between 21 March 2020 and 22 April 2020, 13 patients 
were identified, all of whom were African American 
men95. Six patients required admission to the ICU and 
two patients died during hospitalization. Of note, the 
clinical presentation and laboratory markers of disease 
severity of these patients were not distinct from those 
of the general population, despite immunosuppression 
use to preserve allograft function. However, another case 
series involving 28 heart transplantation recipients with 
COVID-19 in New York reported higher mortality and 
an increased incidence of severe complications in these 
individuals than in the general population96. A total of 
22 patients were hospitalized, of whom 7 patients required 
mechanical ventilation and 7 patients died (case fatality 
rate 25%). Moreover, 13 out of 17 patients had myocar￾dial injury, as evidenced by elevated levels of troponin T 
(>0.022ng/ml).
These findings suggest that recipients of heart trans￾plantation are at high risk of severe complications from 
COVID-19. Whether organ transplantation recipients are 
more susceptible to COVID-19 and whether immuno￾suppressive treatments have harmful (or protective) 
effects on disease progression needs to be assessed in 
large-scale studies. Another important point regarding 
heart transplantation is the need to screen for COVID-19. 
Given that individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
might be asymptomatic, routine screening of donor 
tissues is necessary during the pandemic. Screening of 
recipients before transplantation will also be required to 
avoid worsening of subclinical infection after starting 
immunosuppression.
As with patients with CVD, patients with cancer are 
thought to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symp￾toms than the general population97–99. This high risk 
of poor outcomes might be attributable to suppressed 
immunity by chemotherapy, the presence of cardiovas￾cular risk factors (such as hypertension and diabetes), 
cardiotoxicity of cancer treatment and/or cardiovascular 
damage by COVID-19, combined with their impaired 
baseline condition97. Therefore, a major considera￾tion in the delivery of care to these patients during the 
pandemic is to balance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infec￾tion with the need to provide timely cancer treatment. 
Clinicians need to determine the optimal timing of treat￾ment in patients with cancer and cardiovascular comor￾bidities, especially if they are infected with or exposed to 
SARS-CoV-2. Routine COVID-19 screening might be 
necessary before cancer treatment to avoid worsening 
of a subclinical infection.
ACE2 and cardiovascular manifestations
The mechanisms underlying the development of 
COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury are not 
known. ACE2 expression is thought to be one of the 
major factors involved in the biological mechanism 
underlying tissue-specific infection. As with SARS-CoV, 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by binding of viral 
S protein to human ACE2, whereas TMPRSS2 induc￾es S protein priming4
. The interaction between S protein 
and ACE2 has gained much research interest given that 
ACE2 is known to have crucial roles in both the cardi￾ovascular system and the immune system61,100. ACE2 is 
a part of the RAAS and is involved in the development 
of diabetes, hypertension and heart failure. At the tissue 
level, ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs, kidneys, 
heart and blood vessels61,100. According to bulk RNA 
sequencing data in the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) project V8, the expression of ACE2 in the heart 
and coronary arteries is even higher than in the lungs101. 
At the single-cell level, ACE2 is highly expressed in 
pericytes of adult human hearts102. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing data have also revealed that cardiomyocytes 
(especially those in the right ventricle) express ACE2 at 
a lower level than pericytes and that neither pericytes 
nor cardiomyocytes express TMPRSS2 (ref.103). However, 
both cell types have a high expression of cathepsin B 
and cathepsin L, which facilitate S protein priming and 
might promote entry of the virus into the cell via the 
endocytic pathway. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might be 
capable of directly infecting multiple cardiovascular cell 
types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and 
pericytes. Importantly, however, expression of ACE2 is 
not in itself sufficient for entry of the virus into a cell, 
and the efficiency of viral replication and release might 
also have a role in host cell infection. To date, clinical 
evidence of direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes 
has not been found. Given that myocarditis related 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare23,53, the interaction 
NAture RevIeWS | CARDIOLOGy
Reviews
 volume 17 | September 2020 | 551

between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 might affect the 
cardiovascular system in an indirect manner61,100. 
Genome-wide association studies would help to facil￾itate the identification of novel pathways involved in 
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis104,105.
Potential downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV entry into cells has been shown to downregu￾late ACE2 expression62,106,107. In a mouse model of SARS, 
ACE2 levels in the heart were significantly reduced 
after SARS-CoV infection62. In addition, a separate 
study reported that knockout of Ace2 in mice resulted 
in a significant reduction in cardiac contractility108. 
Furthermore, Ace2–/–Apoe–/– mice had greater atheroscle￾rotic plaque accumulation and upregulated expression of 
genes encoding adhesion molecules and inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-6 and CCL2 compared with Apoe–/–
mice109. These results support a cardioprotective role of 
ACE2 (ref.61).
Similarly, ACE2 has a protective effect in the lungs. 
ACE2 is expressed primarily in alveolar epithelial type II 
cells in the normal adult lung110–112. These cells produce 
surfactant proteins that reduce surface tension, pre￾venting the alveoli from collapsing. In a mouse model 
of ARDS, Ace2 knockout exacerbated acute lung injury, 
whereas treatment with recombinant ACE2 rescued 
lung damage106. Therefore, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 
infection might result in the downregulation of ACE2, 
which can lead to cardiac dysfunction and progression 
of atherosclerosis, as well as exacerbated lung damage.
ACE2 as a therapeutic target. Angiotensin II, the main 
effector molecule in the RAAS, is upregulated in many 
diseases and is a common treatment target for various 
cardiovascular disorders61,100,113. ACE2 inactivates angi￾otensin II by converting angiotensin II to angioten￾sin (1–7)61,100. Cryogenic electron microscopy studies 
have demonstrated that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 
can directly bind to human ACE2 with a similar or 
even higher affinity than the binding of the S protein 
of SARS-CoV to human ACE2 (refs9–11). In this con￾text, a study has shown that exogenous administration 
of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) can prevent 
SARS-CoV-2 infection by acting as a decoy114. The 
investigators demonstrated that clinical-grade rhACE2 
can reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture and in 
engineered human blood vessel organoids and kidney 
organoids114. Given that rhACE2 has been shown to be 
protective against various CVDs61,115,116, rhACE2 therapy 
might be a promising approach to treat patients with 
COVID-19-related cardiovascular disorders114.
Broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2
Although SARS-CoV-2 preferentially infects the lungs 
and respiratory tract like other respiratory viruses, 
COVID-19 can cause a diverse range of extrapulmo￾nary manifestations including CVD, stroke, seizures, 
liver damage, renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal 
symptoms117. Systemic hyperinflammation induced 
by viral pneumonia is likely to have an important role 
in the development of these varied manifestations of 
COVID-19, but numerous studies have also reported 
histological evidence of direct viral infection in 
non-respiratory organs such as the heart, brain, liver 
and kidney59,69,118.
In an autopsy case series involving 12 patients with 
COVID-19, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected 
by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in the lungs 
at high concentrations in all patients, 5 patients also 
had high viral RNA titres in the heart, liver or kidney59. 
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lungs, 
heart, brain, liver or kidneys in an autopsy analysis of 
27 patients who died with COVID-19 (ref.118), indicat￾ing a broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2. Although 
the specific cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 in each 
organ are unknown, these preliminary data support 
the possibility that the extrapulmonary manifestations 
and multiorgan failure observed in patients who died 
with COVID-19 are not just a consequence of systemic 
inflammation or cytokine storm, but might also be 
caused by direct infection of numerous organ systems by 
SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, the broad tissue tropism 
of SARS-CoV-2 might be a result of the instability of the 
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 related to the presence of 
the novel furin cleavage site, as mentioned above4
.
Viral targeting of endothelial cells
Preliminary histological data from a case series of three 
patients with COVID-19 have shown that endothelial 
cells might be a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 infection69. 
In a patient with a history of renal transplantation who 
died from COVID-19-induced multiorgan failure, 
viral particles were detected by electron microscopy in 
endothelial cells in the kidney69. A prominent endotheli￾itis (inflammation within the endothelium) with recruit￾ment of inflammatory cells was identified on histological 
assessment, as well as an unusually high concentration of 
apoptotic bodies in numerous organs including the lungs, 
small bowel and heart69. In another patient who died from 
COVID-19-related multiorgan failure and ST segment 
elevation myocardial infarction, lymphocytic endotheli￾itis was observed in the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys69. 
In the third patient who had mesenteric ischaemia and 
underwent resection of the small intestine, histological 
assessment of the small intestine revealed prominent 
endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels in addition to a 
large concentration of apoptotic bodies69. Findings from 
this case series suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect 
endothelial cells directly, which can lead to inflammation 
in the endothelium69. Given that endothelial cells are an 
important component of every organ and have a high level 
of ACE2 expression, inflammation in the endothelium 
caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 might underlie the 
diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19.
Potential drug–disease interactions
The potential drug–disease interactions in patients with 
COVID-19 have become a highly researched topic12–14
(Fig. 2). First, whether antihypertensive agents such as 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers 
(ARBs) are involved in the progression or prevention of 
COVID-19 is unknown113,119. Second, some of the poten￾tial antiviral drugs used to treat patients with COVID-19 
are known to induce cardiotoxicity41.

Effect of RAAS inhibitors on COVID-19
Given that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, clini￾cians have expressed concern that medications that 
upregulate the cell surface expression of ACE2 might 
be harmful113,119,120. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been 
shown to increase the expression of ACE2 in animal 
models121. Given that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs are 
commonly used worldwide for the treatment of hyper￾tension and other CVDs, whether these drugs should 
be discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic has 
become a pertinent question. Importantly, indiscrim￾inate withdrawal of these drugs could harm high-risk 
patients. Several medical societies including the ACC, 
AHA, Chinese Society of Cardiology, ESC and the Heart 
Failure Society of America have issued statements rec￾ommending continuation of RAAS antagonists for those 
who are currently prescribed these agents122–124. Findings 
from clinical studies support this recommendation. In 
four studies from Spain (n=1,139)125, Italy (n=6,772)126
and the USA (n=5,894 and 1,735)127,128, the use of RAAS 
inhibitors was not associated with a positive COVID-19 
test, suggesting that these agents do not affect suscep￾tibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the 
use of these agents was not associated with a substan￾tial increase in the risk of severe or fatal illness among 
patients with COVID-19 (refs126,127).
Two main points need to be discussed on this 
topic. First, the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 is 
controversial113. As shown in Fig. 3, the targets of ACE 
and ACE2 are different despite high structural similarity 
between the two enzymes. ACE converts angiotensin I to 
angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 degrades angiotensin II 
to angiotensin (1–7). ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion 
from angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ARBs inhibit 
the angiotensin II receptor type 1, which is downstream 
of angiotensin II61,113. Therefore, neither class of drugs 
affects ACE2 directly. Although some animal studies have 
shown that treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs can 
increase the expression of Ace2 (refs121,129), findings from 
other preclinical studies were more mixed113,119,120,130–132. In 
clinical studies, long-term exposure to the ACE inhibitor 
captopril133 or the ARB olmesartan134 was associated with 
increased plasma levels of angiotensin (1–7) or urinary 
levels of ACE2, respectively, indicating increased ACE2 
activity. However, other studies have not shown evidence 
of upregulated ACE2 by RAAS inhibitors in patients with 
heart failure135, aortic stenosis136, atrial fibrillation137 or cor￾onary artery disease138. These inconsistent results are likely 
to be attributable to the indirect effects of ACE inhibitors 
or ARBs on ACE2, which depend on conditions such as 
baseline expression levels of ACE2, dosing and treatment 
periods. Second, whether potential upregulation of ACE2 
is harmful or protective is uncertain. Even if ACE inhib￾itors or ARBs can upregulate ACE2, no direct evidence 
has been found to show that upregulation of ACE2 affects 
susceptibility to viral infection113. Furthermore, as shown 
in Ace2-knockout mice106–109 and rhACE2 studies114–116, 
ACE2 is considered to be protective rather than harm￾ful in settings of lung injury and CVDs61,100. Together, 
these findings indicate no benefit of withdrawal of ACE 
inhibitors or ARBs in protecting against COVID-19.
Cardiovascular effects of antiviral drugs
At present, many research teams worldwide are focused 
on the development of drugs for the prevention and treat￾ment of COVID-19 (ref.41). Of note, the development and 
testing of new drugs are time-consuming processes139
and not a viable strategy during this COVID-19 
pandemic. Drug repurposing139, in which existing med￾ications that have already been approved for a disease 
are tested for a new condition, is currently the main 
approach in the search for new drugs for COVID-19 
(refs41,42,140,141). However, some of the drugs under 
investigation have known or unknown cardiovascular 
adverse effects142 or might be involved in drug–drug or 
drug–disease interactions41,140 (Table 2).
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Chloroquine 
and hydroxychloroquine have been widely touted as 
potential treatment strategies for COVID-19 (refs143–145). 
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can poten￾tially block virus entry into cells, particularly via the 
endosomal pathway, by inhibiting the glycosylation of 
host receptors, proteolytic processing and endosomal 
acidification41,145. These agents can also mediate immuno￾modulatory effects through attenuation of cytokine 
production and inhibition of autophagy and lysoso￾mal activity41. Both drugs are used in the treatment of 
malaria and chronic inflammatory diseases such as sys￾temic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis41,146. 
A French observational study involving 36 patients 
with COVID-19 reported improved virus clearance with 
hydroxychloroquine treatment144. Furthermore, com￾bining hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin in six 
patients resulted in even better virus clearance than with 
the use of hydroxychloroquine alone144. Importantly, 
however, several concerns have been raised regarding

Fig. 3 | ACE2 as a part of the RAAS. Angiotensin II, the main effector molecule in the 
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is upregulated in many pathological 
conditions, for which inhibition of angiotensin II by RAAS inhibitors is a common 
therapeutic strategy.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produces angiotensin II 
from angiotensin I, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II by converting it to 
angiotensin (1–7). Therefore, ACE2 has a protective effect against cardiovascular 
disease and lung injury. In the setting of coronavirus disease 2019, downregulation 
of ACE2 by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection 
might be involved in mediating cardiovascular damage. ARB, angiotensin II receptor

the characteristics of the control group (which consisted 
of patients recruited from a separate hospital) and ethics 
approval147. In a randomized study involving 62 patients 
with COVID-19 in China, patients in the treatment group 
received hydroxychloroquine (400mg per day) for 5 days, 
whereas patients in the control group received standard 
treatment (oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial 
agents and immunoglobulin, with or without corticos￾teroids)143. Hydroxychloroquine improved the time to 
clinical recovery, body temperature recovery time, cough 
remission time and pneumonia-related symptoms com￾pared with standard treatment alone. Furthermore, in a 
retrospective study from Wuhan involving 550 critically 
ill patients with COVID-19, mortality was significantly 
lower among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine 
plus standard treatment (which included other anti￾viral drugs and antibiotics) compared with standard 
treatment alone (18.8% versus 47.4%)148. However, in a 
large observational study involving 1,376 patients from 
New York City, hydroxychloroquine treatment did not 
alter the risk of the composite end point of intubation or 
death149. These inconsistent results show that the efficacy 
of hydroxychloroquine is still controversial and needs to 
be validated in large, randomized studies150.
Although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have 
a long history of clinical use for numerous conditions, 
these agents are also known to induce arrhythmias41,142,151. 
Azithromycin, which has been assessed in combination 
with hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, 
is also known to prolong the QT interval152. In a cohort 
study of 90 patients with COVID-19 who received 
hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin), 
those who received a combination of hydroxychloro￾quine and azithromycin had greater QT interval prolon￾gation than those taking hydroxychloroquine alone151. 
Furthermore, in a retrospective cohort study of 1,438 
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, 
treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or 
both was compared with neither treatment153. None 
of the groups had an increase in in-hospital mortality, 
but the secondary outcome of cardiac arrest was more 
likely in patients receiving both hydroxychloroquine and 
azithromycin than in patients receiving neither drug153. 
Given that some patients with COVID-19 might have 
impaired renal function owing to systemic illness, fre￾quent electrocardiographic evaluation should be strongly 
considered in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine 
and/or azithromycin.
Remdesivir. Remdesivir is a promising investigational 
nucleotide analogue for the treatment of COVID-19 that 
has broad-spectrum antiviral activity and functions by 
targeting RdRP27,154,155. Remdesivir was originally devel￾oped for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. Prophylactic 
and therapeutic administration of remdesivir has been 
shown to improve pulmonary function and to decrease 
viral load in a mouse model of MERS156. In a rand￾omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 
237 patients with COVID-19 in China, remdesivir was 
associated with a numerically (but not statistically signif￾icant) faster time to clinical improvement than was the 
placebo155. Preliminary results from a double-blind, ran￾domized, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial involving 
1,063 patients with COVID-19 indicate that those who 
received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery 
than those who received placebo (median time to recov￾ery 11 days versus 15 days)157. Of note, in light of these 
preliminary findings, the FDA granted emergency use of 
remdesivir for COVID-19 in May 2020 to meet the urgent 
demand for treatment of hospitalized patients158. The 
optimal dosing and duration of treatment is still under 
investigation. Under the emergency use authorization, a 
10-day treatment regimen (200mg on day 1 followed by 
100mg per day for 9 days) is suggested for patients requir￾ing invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation, and a 5-day treatment course is 
suggested for patients with milder symptoms. Although 
prominent cardiovascular adverse effects associated with 
remdesivir have not been reported so far, these might 
become apparent with more widespread use158.
Lopinavir–ritonavir. Lopinavir–ritonavir is a fixed-dose 
drug combination used for the prevention and treat￾ment of HIV infection and works by inhibiting protease 
activity159. Lopinavir is available only in combination 
with ritonavir, which functions to slow the breakdown 
of lopinavir by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 (ref.41). 
In a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 
199 patients with COVID-19, no benefit was observed 
with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment compared with 
standard care159. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were 
more frequently reported in the lopinavir–ritonavir 
treatment group than in the standard group, but adverse

cardiovascular effects were not reported in either 
group159. Nevertheless, lopinavir–ritonavir should be 
used with caution in patients with COVID-19 because 
this drug combination might interact with common car￾diovascular drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome 
P450 3A4, including antiarrhythmic agents, antiplatelet 
drugs and anticoagulants41,160.
Conclusions
Given that numerous studies have demonstrated 
that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features 
with SARS-CoV, our knowledge of the pathophysio￾logical mechanisms underlying SARS can be used to 
understand the disease processes involved in COVID-19. 
Mechanistically, the interaction between the S protein 
and ACE2 is likely to have a central role in disease patho￾genesis, especially in cardiovascular manifestations of 
this disease, and this interaction is a potential target for 
the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Several hurdles need to be overcome in the study of 
the mechanisms underlying COVID-19. First, biological 
experiments using SARS-CoV-2 can be performed only in 
laboratories with a biosafety level 3 rating161,162. Second, the 
use of animal models to mimic the disease process is asso￾ciated with numerous challenges163–165. Given that cellular 
or tissue tropism is likely to be an important factor con￾tributing to the diverse phenotypes of COVID-19 (ref.4
), 
mouse or rat models are not ideal to study host tropism 
because they are not as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as 
humans owing to differences in the amino acid sequence 
of ACE2 (ref.166). To use mice or rats, human ACE2 needs 
to be introduced artificially. Transgenic mice expressing 
ACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported 
to show signs of pneumonia, but the overall symptoms 
experienced by these mice are much milder than those in 
humans163. Therefore, alternative platforms might involve 
genome-edited mouse or rat models in which Ace2 is 
replaced by human ACE2, other animal species that are 
naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (such as 
ferrets, hamsters and non-human primates)164,165,167–170
or in vitro models such as induced pluripotent stem 
cells171–173 and organoids114,174,175.
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing our lives in 
unprecedented ways. Given the lack of safe and effec￾tive vaccines or proven treatments for COVID-19, 
our main strategy to combat the pandemic is social 
distancing. The capacity of health-care systems glob￾ally has been severely tested (and in some countries 
completely overwhelmed), and the effect of this pan￾demic on social interactions, health-care delivery and 
the global economy continues to mount. Reduced 
physical activity owing to lockdown measures might 
also contribute to poor control of cardiovascular 
risk factors. Vaccine development is expected to take 
12–18 months34. To meet the urgent need for effective 
treatment and preventative strategies, a concerted effort 
must be made by researchers globally to investigate 
and integrate biological and clinical findings related to 
COVID-19 (Box 1).
