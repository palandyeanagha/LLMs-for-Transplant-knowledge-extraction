A controversial necrotizing enterocolitis outbreak
in a neonatal unit
To the Editor:
In a recent article Faustini et al. [1] reported an out￾break of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
which occurred in 1999 in the Teaching Hospital
Umberto I in Rome, Italy. The authors claimed that
18 cases of NEC occurred 5–7 days after two clusters
of diarrhoea (14 cases) and an infective origin for the
outbreak.
Our account of the outbreak, published in 1999 [2],
was not referenced by Faustini et al. In our investi￾gation, over the 5-week period NEC was initially
diagnosed in 10 neonates as stage II (definite) and in
four as stage I (suspect). Only the first two cases (stage
II) underwent surgery (NEC histological diagnosis)
[3]. Because of the unusual factors in the outbreak,
which included no mortality, a majority of full-term
babies, few recognized risk factors, and no micro￾organism isolated, a clinical revision of cases,
according to the definition proposed by Bell et al. [4]
was undertaken.
A panel of experts, working double blind, reviewed
the clinical features and checked the radiographs for
NEC confirmatory hallmarks [5], which are essential
for diagnosis [6, 7]. The final result confirmed NEC
stage II diagnosis in three newborns (including the
two who underwent surgery) and stage I in one. This
finding confirmed there had been an epidemic but less
serious than at first feared [2].
In their conclusions Faustini et al. appear to have
misjudged several aspects.
First the authors admit explicitly to having
included as NEC cases neonates not conforming
to Bell’s case definition [4], justifying this decision
by quoting other studies [8–13]. However in these
studies babies without clear signs of pneumatosis
intestinalis on X-ray were included on the basis
of a common isolated aetiological infective agent
[8–10] which was not the case in the outbreak under
review. They also refer to a study showing that
among 136 patients with strictly documented NEC,
19 had never demonstrated pneumatosis intestinalis.
However 15 out of these 19 (79%) patients died of
NEC complications and the remaining four had
NEC confirmed from surgically resected tissue [11].
Another study [12] made a clear distinction between
definite and suspected cases on the basis of radio￾graphic criteria. The final article described an
important multicentre study carried out in 1976 by
Ryder et al. [13] before Bell’s case definition had been
adopted.
Second, the absence of mortality was explained by
stating that the NEC outbreak was consistent with a
less severe form of the disorder which occurred in
healthy, full-term infants. However, this does not ex￾plain why the only two neonates who underwent sur￾gery for their critical conditions, were not the smallest
ones (weight >2500 g).
Third, no microrganism was isolated. NEC aeti￾ology is multifactorial and includes both infective and
non-infective factors [14, 15]. The authors appear
committed to the ‘infective hypothesis’ in spite of the
time elapsed between the first case on 6 June and the
others, and the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms
in the full-term babies. Furthermore to support the
‘infective hypothesis’ they quote ‘ the interruption of
NEC clustering by the use of antibiotics and by con￾trol measures’. However, they omitted to mention
that newborn admissions were stopped on 6 July
1999, and could have avoided overestimating NEC by
doing so.
Fourth, NEC onset age was very low at 1.
3 days
(0–6 days). In a recent review of 17 epidemics [14] a
mean age of 9.
5 days (range 6.
6–29 days) was found.
Faustini et al. cited a study by Wiswell et al. [16],
showing a median onset of 2 days. However, it should

be stressed that all their cases fulfilled Bell’s case
definition [5], especially regarding the radiological
signs.
In conclusion it appears that by ignoring the pre￾ceding clinical revision of cases [2, 5] and misjudging
the unusual conditions occurring in the outbreak
the authors seriously overestimated the size of the
epidemic [1].

The authors reply:
Professors Orsi and Fara question the case definitions
we used in the investigation of an outbreak of mild
necrotizing entercolitis (NEC) in 1999 at the Umberto
I Teaching Hospital, Rome [1]; the size of that epi￾demic; and the infective hypothesis we postulated.
However, neither in the letter they published in 1999
[2], nor in the comments above, do they cast doubt
on the occurrence of an epidemic or on the diagnosis
of NEC.
The correspondents commented that we did not
reference their 1999 account of the outbreak [2].
In fact, their account of the NEC outbreak was based
on our official Italian report [3] and served as a start￾ing point to discuss the ‘errors in radiology and
pathology’. The point was well taken as during the
outbreak more than one revision of NEC cases was
performed by two expert panels (the former com￾missioned by the Umberto I Teaching hospital, the
latter charged by the judge) and the internal
Committee on Nosocomial Infections in which the
correspondents took part. None of these unpublished
revisions was blind with regard to the disease status of
the newborns, as only the suspected NEC cases were
considered. However, a revision of NEC cases in￾volved in the epidemic was published in a study on
reliability of radiological diagnosis carried out after
the outbreak [4]. The study considered 297 X-rays
from 57 high-risk infants, with and without a diag￾nosis of NEC, which were examined blind by three
independent experts in paediatric radiology. In our
report [1], we took into account the results of this
1144 Correspondence

study as the methods and the findings were part of the
available literature.
For the case definition of NEC, we included both
stage II (confirmed) and stage I (suspected) NEC cases
in our analysis, according to Bell’s criteria. Although
we discussed the possibility that stage I cases may
not be NEC cases, as Bell himself underlined, we
preferred to adopt a more sensitive case definition;
in fact, by using both radiological and clinical eva￾luations we reduced the false-negative errors. The
study of the reliability of radiological diagnosis [4]
came to the same conclusion: the reliability was ‘low
for NEC diagnosis and individual radiological signs
among the three expert radiologists’ as ‘ the level of
agreement beyond chance for radiographic diagnosis
suspected/confirmed was 0.
31 (P<0.
01)’. These
authors concluded ‘clinical information and the
presence of more than one radiological sign can re￾duce the margin of observer’s error that inevitably
exists when dealing with a diagnosis as difficult
as NEC’. In our study, the clinical radiologists diag￾nosed 10 pneumatoses (stage II of NEC) and six
loop distensions (stage I of NEC) (the radiological
diagnosis for two children was not reported in the
chart). Despite the poor reliability of radiology for
this condition, the independent and blind revision of
13 NEC cases in our study confirmed (based on the
agreement between two radiologists) three cases as
NEC stage II, and eight cases as NEC stage I; the
radiographs of two children were classified as nega￾tive. We did overestimate the epidemic, for two cases,
as we tried to be as sensitive as possible in describing
an epidemic for a disease characterized by low sensi￾tivity of diagnosis.
The isolation of an infective agent is not included at
all among Bell’s criteria for confirmed NEC, because
of the multi-factorial nature of the disease and be￾cause no single bacterial agent or virus has been con￾sistently identified as a cause of NEC. There is general
agreement, however, that NEC does not occur with￾out bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.
We hypothesized an infective nature of the epi￾demic based on three observations: (a) the time-space
clustering of cases, (b) the clinical characteristics of
the NEC cases (higher birth weights, fewer perinatal
complications, lower case fatality rate than usually re￾ported in sporadic cases), (c) the sequence diarrhoea –
NEC, as reported in at least seven papers previously.
The characteristics of a disease in populations or
groups have allowed epidemiologists to hypothesize
the nature and even the aetiology of an emerging
disease or an epidemic, even those not yet confirmed
microbiologically. This contribution to public health
is very important, as occurred with Burkitt’s lym￾phoma, AIDS, and SARS.
The detection of an infective agent did not confirm
the diagnosis of NEC for single patients, but in many
other epidemics referenced in our paper, it allowed the
authors to conclude that when a cluster of NEC oc￾curs, the infective hypothesis is highly probable. In
this case, it is legitimate to include even stage I cases in
analysing the epidemic, because infective cases gener￾ally had mild symptoms, and were not in critical
condition. Obviously, if a microorganism had been
isolated from NEC cases in this outbreak, we could
have confirmed the nature of the epidemic, instead of
only making a hypothesis. Unfortunately, the stools
of the children involved in the outbreak were tested
only for Salmonella and Shigella before antibiotic
therapy, and no blood cultures were done. That was
an obvious mistake. The only conclusion that can be
made is that microorganisms were not tested ad￾equately. We cannot conclude that no microorgan￾isms were isolated. This mistake surprised us, because
a laboratory surveillance of diarrhoea was active in
the region (including Rome) during the outbreak,
testing any bloody stool samples for Escherichia coli,
one of the bacteria frequently implicated in NEC
epidemics.
The infective hypothesis seems to be the only
possible explanation of the two confirmed stage II
cases, which underwent surgical intervention. They
were not the smallest (weight >2500), nor were
they in critical condition. They underwent surgery
because of the serious lesions in their abdomen, and
not because of their overall poor condition. What
possible explanation besides infection can the
commentators suggest for these two cases of con￾firmed NEC ?
Professors Orsi and Fara did not present alterna￾tive hypotheses which we would have liked to discuss.
Their criticisms do not provide additional evidence to
alter our conclusions.

Tattoos, incarceration and hepatitis B and C among
street-recruited injection drug users in New Mexico,
USA: update
To the Editor:
In a previous report [1], we described significant risks
for hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) posi￾tivity associated with receipt of tattoos, particularly
while incarcerated, among a street-recruited popu￾lation of injection drug users (IDUs) in New Mexico,
United States from 1995 to 1997. Another recent
report in this Journal, based on a study conducted on
prisoners in Australia, found tattooing in prison to be
an independent risk for HCV [2]. Another report also
described a strong association between tattoos and
HCV, but found the strongest association to be with
commercial tattooing venues [3]. That study found the
risk associated with receipt of tattoos in prison elev￾ated, but not statistically significant. That same report
reviewed other articles and found a significant risk for
HCV infection associated with tattoos in six out of
eight studies that had data available. Further, a recent
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) document summarized the literature on risks
for hepatitis infections in correctional settings and
developed extensive control guidelines [4].
We noted in our previous report that the observed
association between HBV/HCV and tattoos received
while incarcerated may have been confounded by
history of incarceration. Many studies have described
elevated rates of HBV and HCV in prison settings [4],
including HBV in the penitentiary of New Mexico
prior to identification of the HCV virus [5]. Therefore,
in an attempt to independently assess the effect of
tattoos, incarceration, and receipt of tattoos while
incarcerated, we added items to our 1998 IDU out￾reach programme asking specifically about lifetime
history of incarceration.
A total of 469 IDUs participated in the 1998 pro￾gramme, which was conducted in Bernalillo County,
New Mexico (where Albuquerque, the largest city in
New Mexico, is located). The demographic and
behavioural characteristics of these participants were
similar to the characteristics previously described [1].
Notably, these participants were primarily male
(70.
2%) and Hispanic (70.
1%). Of these participants,
1.
3% (6/469) were HIV antibody positive, 64.
5%
(285 out of 442 tested) were HBV antibody (anti-HBc)
positive, and 86.
7% (386 out of 445 tested) were HCV
antibody positive. Twenty-four participants not
tested for HBV or HCV were excluded from further
analyses. The associations between most of the
demographic (e.g. gender, race/ethnicity) and beha￾vioural (e.g. sharing injection equipment, years of
injection, and tattoo) characteristics with HBV and
HCV were similar to our previous report. In particu￾lar, Hispanics were more likely to be HBV and HCV
positive than were non-Hispanic whites. One excep￾tion to our previous report was that even in the
youngest age groups, a large proportion of partici￾pants were already HCV positive [e.g. 86.
4% of 15- to
24-year-olds (n=22); compared to 45.
5% (n=112)
previously, P<0.
001].
Overall, 9.
0% of project participants reported
never having been in jail or prison, 49.
2% reported
having been in jail only, 2.
9% reported having been in
prison only, and 38.
9% reported have been in both
jail and prison. Because prison generally involves a
much longer period of incarceration than jail, and
because the number of participants that had been in
prison only was small, for this analysis ‘prison only’
and ‘jail and prison’ were combined into ‘ any pris￾on’. Table 1 shows that participants who had been in
prison were significantly more likely to be positive for
both HBV (78%) and HCV (94%) than were par￾ticipants who had not been incarcerated (43% and
75% respectively). Participants who had been in jail
only were also more likely than those never incar￾cerated to test positive for both HBV (57%) and HCV
(83%), but these differences were not statistically

significant. The statistical power for these compari￾sons is limited because only 40 participants reported
never having been incarcerated. Table 1 shows that
participants with tattoos were significantly more
likely to be HCV positive (90%) than participants
without tattoos (78%). The same pattern is seen for
HBV seropositivity but this difference did not reach
statistical significance (P=0.
06). Table 1 also shows
the very strong association between increasing years
of injection and both HBV and HCV seropositivity.

Because of strong interrelationships between these
key variables and potential confounding, multivariate
logistic regression using SAS version 8 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) was used to assess independent
associations of these characteristics with HBV and
HCV positivity. We used standard stepwise pro￾cedures to determine the final models, and reassessed
these models by forcing certain variables into or out
of the models. Because ‘ tattoo’ and ‘venue of tattoo’
could not be included in the same model due to
complete collinearity, we ran separate models that
included a dichotomous ‘yes/no’ tattoo variable, and
a four-level ‘no tattoo, tattoo-none in prison/jail,
tattoo-some in prison/jail, tattoo-all in prison/jail’
variable. For HBV, tattoo (both dichotomous and
four level), age, and years of injection were retained in
the final models, and tattoos in prison/jail appeared to
be associated with positivity more strongly than tat￾toos not in prison/jail (Table 2). For HCV, similar
associations were seen, but age was not retained; and
sharing contaminated equipment and race/ethnicity
were retained. Importantly, the incarceration variable
was not significant in any final model, and appears to
be significant in the univariate analysis only because
of the strong confounding effect of years of injection.
Data not shown indicate a very strong association of
incarceration with years of injection – they indicate,
not surprisingly, that the longer people have been
injecting, the more likely they are to be in jail and then
in prison. Length of time in prison was assessed for
persons who had been in prison, and it was also found
to be associated with HBV and HCV in univariate but
not multivariate analyses. The incarceration variables
were only significant in multivariate models if the
years of injection variable was forced out of the
models.
These 1998 outreach project data found a strong
association in univariate analysis of having been in
prison, compared to never having been incarcerated,
for both HBV and HCV. Univariate analysis also
found a strong association of tattooing and HCV and
a marginal association with HBV. However, multi￾variate analysis indicates that the observed associ￾ation between prison and HCV and HBV positivity is
due to confounding by years of injection. In final
analyses, an independent association of tattooing
with both HBV and HCV remained significant, and
for HBV tattoos received in prison appear to be par￾ticularly risky. These findings suggest that the
previously reported association of HBV and HCV
with having received a tattoo in prison is more from
the tattooing risk than any other prison risk.
Hepatitis prevention activities should include edu￾cation about risks associated with tattooing and
should support efforts to emphasize sanitary tattoo￾ing practices in all settings. Because of previously
described unsanitary tattooing practices in prisons
[1, 6], public health action needs to be taken to prevent
bloodborne pathogen transmission in prisons, includ￾ing consideration of making sterile tattooing equip￾ment available.
