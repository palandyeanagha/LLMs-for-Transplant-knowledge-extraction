Abstract
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of green tea extract on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipid
abnormalities on glycemic and lipid profiles, and hormone peptides by a double-blinded, randomized and placebo￾controlled clinical trial. This trial enrolled 92 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipid abnormalities randomized into 2
arms, each arm comprising 46 participants. Of the participants, 39 in therapeutic arm took 500 mg green tea extract, three
times a day, while 38 in control arm took cellulose with the same dose and frequency to complete the 16-week study.
Anthropometrics measurements, glycemic and lipid profiles, safety parameters, and obesity-related hormone peptides were
analyzed at screening and after 16-week course. Within-group comparisons showed that green tea extract caused a
significant decrease in triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index after 16 weeks. Green tea
extract also increased significantly high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The HOMA-IR index decreased from 5.463.9 to
3.562.0 in therapeutic arm only. Adiponectin, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B100 increased significantly in both
arms, but only glucagon-like peptide 1 increased in the therapeutic arm. However, only decreasing trend in triglyceride was
found in between-group comparison. Our study suggested that green tea extract significantly improved insulin resistance
and increased glucagon-like peptide 1 only in within-group comparison. The potential effects of green tea extract on insulin
resistance and glucagon-like peptide 1 warrant further investigation.

Introduction
Both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and dyslipidemia are
individually associated with a cluster of risk factors of atheroscle￾rosis. Lipoprotein abnormalities also increase the thrombotic risk
of diabetic patients [1]. Common risk factors for coronary artery
disease explain only 25–50% of increased atherosclerotic risk in
diabetes mellitus. Other obvious risk factors are hyperglycemia
and dyslipidemia. However, hyperglycemia is a very late stage in
the sequence of events from insulin resistance to frank diabetes,
whereas lipoprotein abnormalities are manifested during the
largely asymptomatic diabetic prodrome and contribute to the
increased risk of macrovascular disease [2]. Combining medica￾tion with lifestyle modification is a logical approach to reduce
cardiovascular risk in individuals with dyslipidemia and T2DM
[3].
Tea, derived from the plant Camellia sinensis is consumed in
the world as green, black or Oolong tea. Among them, green tea
has the most significant effects on cardiovascular protection, and
the effects of green tea are mainly attributed to its flavonoid-like
polyphenols, such as catechins. Catechins concluded mainly
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin, epicatechin
gallate, and epicatechin, which are the most common green tea
extracts (GTE). EGCG is the major catechin in tea and may
account for 50–80% of the total catechins in tea [4]. Although
several studies implied that EGCG may have the potential to
improve the glycemic and lipid profiles in patients with diabetes
and dyslipidemia [5–8], the effect of GTE on glucose and lipid
control was inconsistent, and the underlying mechanism was still
unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of
decaffeinated GTE on anthropometric measurements, glycemic
and lipid profile, as well as hormone levels by a randomized,
double-blinded, and placebo-controlled clinical trial.

This clinical trial was conducted from April 2011 to March
2012 at Taipei City Hospital in Taiwan. Among 236 registered
patients with T2DM, whose glycemic hemoglobin higher than
6.5% within 3 months, screened at our outpatient clinic, 102
subjects met the following criteria were enrolled: (1) age between
20 and 65 years, (2) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for more than one
year, (3) body mass index (BMI) $ 18 kg/m2 and #30 kg/m2, (4)
fasting triglyceride $ 150 mg/dl or fasting low-density-lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL) $100 mg/dl and (5) willing to participate in and
fill out questionnaires for this trial. The exclusion criteria include
(1) serum alanine transaminase .80 U/L, (2) serum creatinine
.1.8 mg/dl, (3) breast feeding or pregnancy, (4) heart failure,
acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heavy injury, and (5) any other
conditions not suitable for trial as evaluated by the physician.
Letters explaining the purpose of the study were sent to all the
patients inviting their participation. Finally, with a written
informed consent, 102 subjects were enrolled in this study. The
protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Taipei
City Hospital. This trial (NCT01360567) was registered with the
ClinicalTrials.gov Registry on 20 May 2011 and followed the
CONSORT 2010 statements. The protocol for this trial and
supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting
information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.
Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a decaffeinated
GTE EGCG (Group A) or a placebo (cellulose; Group B) for 16
weeks (Figure 1). Both experimental and placebo treatments were
contained in the same opaque capsules, which were administered
by a blinded research assistant. Subjects were instructed to
maintain an isocaloric diet and to continue their previous eating
habits during the study period. Every four weeks, subjects returned
to our clinics and reported to the study center for adverse events
and compliance assessment. Subjects were free to withdraw at any
time. Throughout the study period, subjects were directed to
continue taking the same dose of any prescribed hypoglycemic
agents unless hypoglycemia or severe complications occurred, in
which case they were directed to reduce their dose immediately.
Preparation of samples and treatment
Decaffeinated GTE was obtained from the Tea Research and
Extension Station, Taoyuan County, Taiwan. It was extracted
from dried leaves of green tea according to pre-set standard
procedures. The decaffeinated GTE used in this study was
standardized for several tea catechins in addition to EGCG
(Table 1). The placebo comprised pure microcrystalline cellulose.
Capsules contained either 500 mg decaffeinated GTE extract or
cellulose. Subjects were asked to take one capsule 30 minutes after
meals three times daily for 16 weeks. Table 1 lists the total daily
dose of GTE compounds received by the active group.
Analysis of obesity-related hormone peptides
The levels of obesity-related hormone peptides, including leptin,
insulin, ghrelin, adiponectin, apolipoprotein (apo) A1, apolipopro￾tein B100, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (7–36) were
measured in the morning after 8–9 hours of fasting. Whole blood
sample was drawn and centrifuged at 4uC, with 1 ml aliquot of
serum rapidly frozen at 280uC for the subsequent radioimmuno￾assay concentration analysis. Leptin was detected by the Millipore
Human Leptin assay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) using
I125-labled human leptin antiserum with a sensitivity of 0.5 ng/ml
for a 100-mL sample. Ghrelin and adiponectin were detected by
Millipore Ghrelin RIA Kits (Millipore, St. Charles) and Millipore
Adiponectin RIA kits (Millipore, St. Charles) with a sensitivity of
93 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively. We used the same process as
that for leptin detection only with different I125-labled antibodies
specific for ghrelin or adiponectin. BioSource INS-IRMA Kits
(BioSource Europe S.A., Nivelles, Belgium) were employed to
determine the level of insulin in serum as previously reported
[9,10]. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were
3.1% and 4.9%, respectively. The limit of sensitivity is 0.5 ng/ml.
Sampling would be reported if a difference exceeding 10%
coefficients of variation was found between duplicated results of
the sample. The level of insulin resistance was evaluated by the
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA￾IR), which was calculated with the following model: HOMA-IR
= insulin [mIU/L] 6 glucose [mmol/L]/22.5, and values
exceeding 2.25 would denote insulin resistance [11]. Circulating
level of GLP-1 (7–36) was determined by the Millipore Human
glucagon-like peptide-1 RIA kits (Millipore, St. Charles) with a
sensitivity of 3 pmol for a 300-mL extracted sample. [12,13] Apo
AI and apo B-100 were detected by immunoturbidimetric assay
(K-assay, Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, USA).
Quality of life
To measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among
our subjects, we used the self-administered life-quality question￾naires, world health organization quality of life-BREF (WHO￾QOL-BREF), Taiwan version which was well validated with
consistency coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.77 [14]. The
WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire evaluated quality of life in
physical, psychological, social and environmental domains, with
scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores in this questionnaire
represent better health condition. Previous study showed that body
weight loss could improve HRQOL; hence we use WHOQOL￾BREF questionnaire to assess the effects of green tea extracts on
quality of life [15].
Assessment
The single primary outcome was defined as the change of
triglyceride (TG) level. The secondary outcomes were evaluated by
anthropometric measurements in terms of body weight, height,
BMI, waist circumference, and hip circumference. Biochemical
characteristics of blood sample including fasting blood sugar,
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol
levels, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), obesity-related
hormone peptides, and HRQOL scores on the WHOQOL-BREF
were also assessed. The safety parameters included serum alanine
transaminase, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR), and adverse event reports. All measurements of
biochemical characteristics and obesity-related hormone peptides
of blood sample were made at 0800–0900 after an overnight
fasting using standardized methods, as detailed in our previous
research [16]. All participating physicians received prior training
before the study on how to interview the participants and assist
them in completing the questionnaires.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 17.0,
Chicago, IL.) Independent t-tests were employed to examine the
difference in anthropometrics, biochemical characteristics, obesity￾related hormone peptides, and life-quality scores between EGCG
group and placebo group. Paired t-tests were employed to examine
the difference between before and after intervention for 16 weeks
in both groups. All p values were two-tailed and a level of
significance was set at 0.05. Our own experience suggested a
standard deviation (SD) of 3.5% in a previous series of 60 patients
with diabetes. It was calculated that to detect a reduction in

triglyceride level of 2.4% with a significance level of 0.05 and a
power of 0.8, that 64 patients would be required. Allowing for a
10% dropout, 70 patients would be needed in this study.
Results
Data were analyzed on a per-protocol basis, with subject
exclusion occurring before release of the double-blind procedure.
A total of 102 subjects were enrolled. Nine subjects did not receive
their allocated intervention as they failed to attend study visit
because of work commitments or moving out of the area. One
subject with poor blood sugar control (fasting plasma glucose
values $ 500 mg/dL) at baseline was excluded as the primary
investigator considered the risk of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
nonketotic coma. In the end, 92 subjects were randomly assigned.
Further 7 subjects in the EGCG group and 8 subjects in the
placebo group discontinued the intervention. Consequently, the
data reported here came from 77 subjects (Fig. 1).
Baseline characteristics for both placebo and EGCG groups are
shown in Table 2. No significant differences between any of the
group means were detected in demographic, disease duration,
glycemic, and lipid parameters (Table 2). To monitor compliance,
subjects were required to return all packaging and unused
capsules. Each subject received 336 capsules and on average
9.9613.0 capsules per subject (12.3615.0 capsules from the
EGCG group and 7.5610.1 capsules from the placebo group)
were returned, indicating that more than 95% of doses were taken.
To clarify the effect of concomitant medications on blood
pressure, sugar and lipid levels, medications taken by the subjects
were reviewed (Table 3). More than half of the participants, 21
subjects (53.8%) in the EGCG group and 23 subjects (60.5%) in
the placebo group, took the oral antidiabetes medications.
Although the percentage of antidiabetes medication usage was
higher in the placebo group, the difference was not statistically
significant (p = 0.097). Moreover, 6 subjects (15.4%) in the EGCG
group and 4 subjects (10.5%) in the placebo group took

antihypertensive medications; while 6 subjects (15.4%) in the
EGCG group and 2 subjects (5.3%) in the placebo group took the
lipid modifying medications. There was no statistically significant
difference in any concomitant medication between the two groups.
The 16-week treatment with decaffeinated GTE resulted in
decreasing body weight and BMI (p ,0.1), compared with
baseline measurements, as shown in Table 4a. On the other
hands, there is no significant changes in other anthropometric
data, including waist circumference, hip circumference, and blood
pressure after the 16-week course. Between-group comparison
results are listed in Table 5a. There were no statistically significant
differences detected for any of the variables assessed after 16 weeks
of decaffeinated GTE versus placebo treatment.
Regarding serum lipid profiles, fasting TG decreased from
178.26105.3 to 159.3691.6 with statistical significance in the
EGCG group (p = 0.03). However, fasting TG increased from
198.36127.9 to 208.26118.2 in the placebo group. In spite of the
2.1638.5 percent of decrement in EGCG group and the
18.8658.3 percent of increment in placebo group, decaffeinated
EGCG led to a decreasing trend in serum TG (p,0.1). The total
cholesterol level decreased slightly from 195.5637.4 to
193.6640.0 without statistically significant difference in EGCG
group. HDL increased significantly from 49.5613.6 to 52.2615.7
in the EGCG group (p = 0.04), but the level after cellulose
treatment was almost the same. In the between-group analysis, the
percentages of increment in HDL were 6.1616.0 in the EGCG

statistical significance. LDL increased from 109.7631.9 to
111.8637.7 in the EGCG group but declined from 115.2635.4
to 111.9632.4 in the placebo group; and neither difference was
statistically significant.
As for blood sugar and insulin resistance, fasting glucose
increased from 139.2645.1 to 148.2648.1 in the EGCG group,
but decreased slightly from 152.2653.5 to 151.6661.7 in the

the EGCG group also decreased after the 16-week course but did
not achieve statistical significance. Adiponectin increased mark￾edly in both groups but showed no statistically significant
difference between groups. There was also no statistically
significant difference in leptin level in the two groups. The hsCRP
significantly increased in both groups with difference of 0.160.2.

Apo AI increased significantly in both groups and the differences
were 53.9664.3 in the EGCG group and 31.3658.7 in the
placebo group. Apo B-100 also increased significantly in both
groups and the differences are 34.4657.7 in the EGCG group and
17.3637.0 in the placebo group. GLP-1 in EGCG group
increased from 1.461.2 to 2.661.6 with statistical significance
(p = 0.001), but the difference in GLP-1 in the placebo group
didn’t achieve statistical significance. However, none of the
differences between the groups reached statistical significance
(table 5b).
Adverse Effects
In the experimental group, one subject in the experimental
group experienced symptoms of epigastric dullness and two
developed mild constipation, while one subject in the placebo
group had abdominal discomfort. All these symptoms were
relieved in the first week after treatment. No major adverse effects
of either experimental or placebo group were noted.
Discussion
The present initial results revealed no statistically significant
difference between the EGCG and placebo groups in any of the
anthropometric, glycemic, lipid or hormone peptide variables
assessed. Despite of adequate sample size after calculation, the
metabolic responses to EGCG in those patients with type 2
diabetes were various. Because the small sample size, the
difference between the randomized groups was non-significant in
our study. But our within-group analysis explored some new
findings on GLP-1, insulin resistance, and lipid profile such as
triglyceride and HDL, which were less affected by current
antidiabetic medications.
The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has continued to increase
dramatically instead of the improvement in outcomes for
individual patients with diabetes. Lifestyle modification will
undoubtedly play a key role in the ultimate solution to the
problem of diabetes [17]. The anti-diabetic effect of green tea
extracts may raise the potential of green tea to be the lifestyle
modification for diabetic prevention. People who drink at least 4
cups of tea per day may have a 16% lower risk of developing type
2 diabetes than non-tea drinkers [18]. However, green tea
catechins alone do not positively alter anthropometric measure￾ments. A meta-analysis showed that GTE have a positive effect on
weight loss and weight maintenance in obese people (BMI between
25 and 30) [19,20]. To understand the effect of green tea catechins
in anthropometrics of diabetic subjects, and to avoid the potential
confounding effect caused by caffeine in green tea, this study used
decaffeinated GTE. Although a decreasing trend in body weight
and BMI was observed, GTE did not significantly reduce body
weight and BMI of diabetic subjects (BMI around 26) in our study.
This result is similar to other studies for diabetic rats and diabetic
population (BMI around 30) [21,22]. The difference may be due
to the degree of obesity or disease nature, and it merits further
investigation.
To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of GTE on
GLP-1. Our results showed significant within-group changes in
GLP-1 level and HOMA-IR index after 16 weeks of treatment
only in the GTE group, despite there being no significant change
in fasting glucose and HbA1c. Previous research reported a
significant interaction between circulating GLP-1, serum HDL,
and triglyceride concentrations but not waist circumference,
fasting glucose, HbA1c, or presence of diabetes [23]. This result
is consistent with the within-group findings in the present study.
GLP-1 could lower blood sugar with insulin resistance through up￾regulating the pancreatic b-cell to enhance insulin secretion and
suppressing glucagon secretion with gastric emptying. Therefore,
the incretin therapy has been used in different stages of diabetes in
recent years [24–26]. Several studies have shown that T2DM
patients generally exhibit attenuated GLP-1 secretion [27–29]. In
our patients, GLP-1 secretion was lower in both groups and
enhanced only in GTE group, but whether the levels of GLP-1
secretion were sufficient could not be determined. Thondam et al.
reported that metformin increased serum GLP-1 level in T2DM
patients [30], and metformin could also enhance GLP-1 secretion
in GLP-1 producing cell line [31]. This study has avoided the
confounding effects of chronic antidiabetic treatment, because
these treatments did not show any significant difference between
GTE and placebo groups. Although several studies demonstrated
the glucose-lowering effects of GTE, the fasting glucose and
HbA1c did not decrease after GTE supplementation in our study.
This discrepancy might be due to the more obvious patients with
diabetes in our study, whose mean disease duration was around 5
years. The glucose-lowering effects of GTE supplementation are
better in patients with diabetes history of less than 5 years than
those with a history of more than 5 years. The increased GLP-1,
lower insulin, and decreased HOMA-IR were only significant in
the population with disease duration of less than 5 years (data was
not shown). Future studies with larger numbers of patients will be
required to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with a
better GLP-1 response to GTE.
Virtually every lipid and lipoprotein is affected by insulin
resistance and diabetes mellitus, but control of hyperglycemia is
unlikely to correct existing dyslipidemia. Although plasma glucose
control is important in reducing microvascular complications due
to diabetes, lipid management is also essential in these patients to
decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events [32]. In this study,
EGCG significantly reduced fasting triglyceride and increased
HDL in within-group analysis and caused a decreasing trend of
fasting triglycerides in between-group analysis. Adiponectin,
apoA1 and apoB-100 increased significantly in both groups in
within-group comparison. Whether adiponectin is positively
associated with green tea consumption or not remains controver￾sial [33–36]. Green tea extracts also could reduced fat deposit and
ameliorated in high fat-fed rats via the adiponectin associated
pathway [37]. Since adiponectin plays a role in regulating insulin
function and is negatively associated with risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, the clinical effects of GTE on adiponectin
merits further clarification. ApoAI and apoB-100 are the major
apolipoproteins of HDL and LDL, respectively[38]. In vitro study
revealed that EGCG decreased apoB-100 secretion [39,40], which
is inconsistent with our findings. Increased serum LDL, rather
than decreased triglyceride, possibly leads to this discrepancy.
However, the increase in apoAI after EGCG supplementation is
compatible with that in HDL. Current guidelines recommend
statin therapy and lifestyle modification as primary intervention
for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM. However,
even with intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol, patients remain
at high residual risk because of low HDL cholesterol and/or
elevated triglycerides, justifying the need for additional therapy
specifically aimed at the management of these abnormalities [3].
EGCG may be the logical dietary supplement for combination
with a statin in this setting. Large prospective studies are needed to
evaluate the clinical benefits and tolerability of these combinations.
Although the literature reported several suspected green tea￾related hepatic reactions [41], the hepatotoxicity is probably due
to metabolism or concomitant medications of a particular patient.
Neither impaired liver/renal function nor major adverse effects
were seen in our study. As for the limitation of this study, the
Green Tea Extract and Glucagon-Like Peptide 1

relatively small sample size and relatively large variance of the
metabolic measurements made the outcome non-significant.
Besides, the compliance was monitored only by counting the
returned packages and unused capsules. This study didn’t measure
the participants’ serum level of EGCG to confirm the bioavail￾ability and the effects on metabolism. Further research on the
bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of EGCG in human studies is
needed.
In conclusion, the present study showed no statistically
significant difference between decaffeinated GTE and placebo in
anthropometrics, glycemic and lipid profiles, as well as obesity￾related hormone peptides after 16 weeks of treatment. Daily taking
decaffeinated GTE with dose of 856 mg EGCG for 16 weeks is
safe and free of severe adverse effects. The metabolic effects on
GLP-1 and insulin response of decaffeinated GTE in humans
warrant continued investigation.
