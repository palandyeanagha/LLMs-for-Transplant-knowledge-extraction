Abstract
Object To validate the cross-sectional and longitudinal use of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36
(SF-36) for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF).
Methods Patients were administered the SF-36 and concomitantly underwent laboratory and physiologic
tests and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Forty-six patients participated in the initial cross￾sectional study, and 32 patients who were available more than one year later again underwent these studies
under the same conditions.
Results Patients with IPF had significantly lower scores across all 8 domains of the SF-36 when compared
with the general population. Significant decline of HRQL was observed in 2 physical domains. There were
significant differences in within-subject changes in a few domains according to worsening of the physiologic
parameters. Vital capacity as percent of predicted was significantly correlated with the results of 6 subscales
and its changes were significantly correlated with those of 4 subscales. The 6-min-walk distance was corre￾lated significantly with 3 subscales and its changes were significantly correlated with those of 4 subscales.
Changes in the HRCT ground-glass score were significantly correlated with those of 3 subscales. No signifi￾cant correlations between changes in 3 domains and those of any clinical parameters were observed.
Conclusion Patients with IPF had significantly impaired HRQL in both physical and psychological func￾tions. This disease clearly decreased the physical aspects of HRQL over time. HRQL instruments should be
incorporated into routine evaluations of IPF patients, since they measure dimensions not fully estimated by
clinical assessment.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronically pro￾gressive interstitial lung disease that results in severe disabil￾ity and death in the majority of cases. Although currently
available medications, particularly corticosteroids and im￾munosuppressants, are prescribed with the hope of slowing
progression of the disease, they are associated with signifi￾cant side effects and morbidity. The primary reason why
physicians intervene and treat patients with chronic disorders
such as IPF when a cure is known to be impossible is to
improve the length and quality of life. Thus, one of the pri￾mary goals in the current management of IPF is to improve
quality of life (1, 2).
Health-related quality of life (HRQL) has been recognized
as an important feature in determining goals for treatment
and measuring outcome in the care of patients with chronic
disabling illness. Although during the last 20 years HRQL
has been studied for many chronic respiratory diseases, in￾１ Department of Respiratory Medicine, Nishi-Kobe Medical Center, Kobe, ２ Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kobe Nishi City Hospital,

cluding asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), only a handful of studies have examined HRQL in
IPF patients (3-9). In fact, the impact of IPF on patients’
HRQL is not fully understood, and the International Con￾sensus Statement on IPF (1) notes that measurement of
quality of life in IPF patients requires additional study.
Therefore, we cross-sectionally and longitudinally assessed
HRQL in patients with IPF using the Medical Outcome
Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), a generic HRQL instrument.
At present, pulmonary function tests and high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) are used clinically as non￾invasive means of evaluating the activity and monitoring the
course of the disease. In particular, HRCT is the best non￾invasive method for assessing the pattern and quantifying
the extent of the disease in IPF patients (1, 10). In addition,
a recently developed serum marker for interstitial lung dis￾eases, i.e. KL-6, has appeared on the clinical stage to evalu￾ate interstitial lung diseases, including IPF (11, 12). Since
the previous investigators in this field, with one exception
(8), did not use some of these modalities, their studies may
have failed to detect associations between clinical variables
determined by these modalities and HRQL. Furthermore, to
our knowledge, no study has measured longitudinal changes
in HRQL in patients with IPF. The purposes of this study
were (1) to compare the HRQL of IPF patients with that of
the general population as a whole, (2) to test the a priori
hypothesis that low HRQL scores correlate with more severe
clinical parameters demonstrated by KL-6, pulmonary func￾tion tests, exercise tests, and HRCT, (3) to examine longitu￾dinal changes in HRQL and (4) to test the a priori hypothe￾sis that there is a correlation between decline in HRQL and
clinical parameters.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
Forty-six Japanese patients with IPF who were referred to
or followed at the outpatient pulmonary clinic of the Nishi￾Kobe Medical Center, a 500-bed teaching hospital, were re￾cruited for this study between March 2000 and November
2005. Subjects were excluded if they were 80 years of age
or older or if they had an illness other than IPF that might
have an impact on HRQL. In 7 patients, the diagnosis of
IPF was based on the presence of usual interstitial pneumo￾nia (UIP) by a surgical (open or thoracoscopic) lung biopsy.
In the remaining 39 patients, IPF was diagnosed clinically
on the basis of an international consensus statement (1). The
HRCT criteria included a subpleural bilateral interstitial pul￾monary process, including honeycomb changes with mini￾mal areas of associated ground-glass opacity. In 5 of these
39 patients, a UIP pattern was confirmed on autopsy. Pa￾tients with other known possible causes of interstitial lung
disease, such as drug toxicity, environmental exposure, and
collagen vascular diseases, were excluded.
Methods
Pulmonary function tests consisted of determinations of
vital capacity (VC) and diffusing capacity of the lung for
carbon monoxide (DLco) using a CHESTAC-33 system
(Chest, Tokyo, Japan). Predicted normal values for the Japa￾nese population were derived from reference values of the
Japanese Respiratory Society (13) for VC and Nishida et al
(14) for DLco.
Subjects performed a modified 6-min walk test according
to the method of Chang et al (3) in an enclosed level mea￾sured corridor. Supplemental oxygen was permitted at the
same concentration inspired normally during daily activities
at baseline. Oxygen saturation was measured continuously
during the walk using a pulse oxymeter (NPB-40, Mallinck￾rodt Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Only one test was performed.
Either a Pro Seed or a Pro Seed Accell (GE Yokogawa
Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was used for computed to￾mography. HRCT scans were performed with a 2-mm sec￾tion thickness and a 1-s scanning time during breath holding
at the end of inspiration. These scans were reconstructed
with a high spatial frequency algorithm and viewed at win￾dow levels appropriate for pulmonary parenchyma (window
level, -700 Hounsfield units; width, 2000 Hounsfield units).
One radiologist, who was unaware of clinical and functional
findings, examined the HRCT scans following the method
of Xaubet et al (15) with slight modifications. A semiquanti￾tative analysis of the relative proportion (to within 10%) of
both ground-glass and reticular patterns at three predeter￾mined levels, which were the great vessels, pulmonary ve￾nous confluence, and the right diaphragm, was made. Scores
of the three lung zones were then averaged to obtain one
mean score. The serum concentration of KL-6 (normal value
<500 U/ml) was determined by enzyme immunoassay using
commercially available kits (Eisai, Tokyo, Japan).
HRQL was assessed using the SF-36 Japanese test ver￾sion, which is adapted and psychometrically validated for
Japanese (16, 17). In the present study, the SF-36 question￾naire was self-administered, as is the typical procedure. The
questionnaire consisted of 36 questions covering 8 health
concepts: physical function (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily
pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social func￾tioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH).
These 8 health components were scored separately and
transformed to a 0-100 scale according to the guidelines
(18) and using their methods for handling missed items. An
ascending scale was used for scoring, with higher scores in￾dicating a better HRQL and lower scores a worse quality of
life.
All patients were evaluated at our outpatient clinic during
a period of clinical stability. Laboratory tests, which in￾cluded KL-6 measurement, HRCT, pulmonary function tests
and the HRQL questionnaire were administered within one
month. Those who were available more than one year later
again underwent these studies under the same conditions.
The same concentration of supplemental oxygen was used

for both the baseline and repeated 6-min walk test. Informed Table1. BaselineCharacteristicsofPatients(n=46)
consent was obtained from all participants, and the study
protocol had the approval of the local ethics committee.
Some data that we used had been collected as part of a pro￾spective study of aerosolized N-acetylcysteine for IPF (19).
Statistical Analysis
In the cross-sectional study, deviation values for the 8
health components against Japanese reference values were
calculated according to the guidelines (18), and differences
between patients’ scores and the general population mean,
i.e. 50, were tested with the Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Then Spearman’s rank correlation was used
to examine the correlation between the transformed
subscales of the SF-36 and clinical parameters measured.
In the longitudinal study, changes in parameters were ex￾pressed as an absolute value from the initial study. Changes
in the SF-36 transformed subscales and clinical parameters
were analyzed with a paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. Then Spearman’s rank correlation was used to examine
the correlation between the changes of transformed
subscales and those of clinical parameters. Furthermore, for
each clinical parameter the examined patients were divided
into 2 groups (i.e., subjects whose VC decreased by ≧10%
and subjects whose VC did not, subjects whose DLco de￾creased by ≧15% and subjects whose DLco did not, sub￾jects whose lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk
test decreased by ≧4 percentage points and subjects whose
lowest oxygen saturation did not, and subjects who devel￾oped the need for supplemental oxygen during the follow-up
and subjects who did not). Then comparisons were made be￾tween each group and within-subject changes in each SF-36
domain using the Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. Regarding VC, DLco and oxygen desaturation, the ba￾sis for the division was in accordance with the assessment
of pulmonary function tests recommended in the guidelines
(1). Significance was defined as p< 0.05. All analyses were
performed using JMP statistical software (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Cross-sectional Study
Baseline characteristics of the patients (32 males, 14 fe￾males; age 55 to 79 year) are shown in Table 1. Of the 46
subjects, at the time of the initial study, 7 were dependent
on supplemental oxygen and 2 were treated with predniso￾lone (25 mg/day and 2.5 mg/day, respectively). Thirteen pa￾tients were current smokers (they had smoked cigarettes
regularly within the previous year), 19 were former smokers
(they had not smoked cigarettes in the previous year but had
smoked in the past), and 14 were never smokers. The KL-6
value was elevated (mean, 1,198±952 U/ml; range 268 to
4,330 U/ml). DLco was not performed in 2 patients because
of a severe reduction in lung volume.
Figure 1 presents the profile of the deviation values of the
8 health components of the SF-36. All of the mean devia￾tion values were significantly below the national reference
values, i.e. 50. In particular, the mean deviation values of
PF and RP were 37.2 (95% confidence interval, 33.5 to
41.0), and 34.3 (29.8 to 38.7), respectively, which were
markedly low.
Spearman correlation coefficients between each SF-36 do￾main and the clinical parameters are presented in Table 2.
The serum level of KL-6 was not significantly correlated
with scores for any domain. With respect to physiological
parameters, VC as a percent of predicted was significantly
correlated with 6 items; the exceptions were BP and VT.
However, there were no significant correlations with DLco
as a percent of predicted. The 6-min-walk distance was sig￾nificantly correlated with PF, RP and VT. The strongest cor￾relation was observed between PF and the 6-min-walk dis￾tance (ρ=0.68, p<0.01). The lowest oxygen saturation during
the 6-min walk significantly correlated with GH, SF, and
MH. With regard to HRCT scores, the reticular score was
significantly correlated with only PF. When the relation be￾tween pulmonary function tests and HRCT scan scores was
examined, the following significant correlations were found:
VC as a percent of predicted versus ground-glass score
(ρ=-0.33, p<0.05) and reticular score (ρ=-0.50, p<0.001)
and DLco as a percent of predicted versus reticular score

Longitudinal study
Out of the 46 subjects who participated in the initial
cross-sectional study, 32 patients (21 males) completed the
follow-up study. In 2 patients, the observation period from
the initial study was less than one year. Follow-up data were
not available for the remaining 12 patients because of death

due to respiratory failure (n=5) or gastrointestinal bleeding
(n=1), being lost to follow-up (n=3) or the occurrence of
other disorders (lung cancer, gastric cancer, and thrombocy￾topenic purpura, n=1, respectively). Periods from the initial
study to the follow-up study were 12 to 31 months (median
14 months). Newly begun treatment during the follow-up
period was as follows: corticosteroid n=4 and aerosolized N￾acetylcysteine n=11. Although 4 patients developed the need
for supplemental oxygen during the follow-up, all 4 under￾went the 6-min-walk test without supplemental oxygen at
the follow-up study.
Figure 2 presents mean SF-36 scores at baseline and at
follow up. There was a significant decline of HRQL in 2
subscales: PF (p<0.001) and BP (p<0.05). The decrease in
the PF score was particularly noteworthy (mean, -14.6; 95%
confidence interval, -7.1 to -22.0). Although there were de￾clines in SF and MH that were almost significant (mean,
-8.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.26 to -16.7, p=0.057, mean,
-5.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 to -12.1, p=0.064), no
significant changes in the other 4 health components were
shown over time. When within-subject changes in each SF￾36 domain were compared between two subgroups divided
according to the follow-up period, declines did not differ
significantly in each SF-36 score between subjects whose
follow-up period was within 15 months (n=20) and those
whose follow-up period was more than 15 months (n=12)
(data not shown).
Some of the clinical parameters in the 32 patients
changed significantly. Examples of changes included ∆KL-6
in serum = -53.6±656.1 U/ml (p=0.75), ∆VC = -5.8±13.6%
of predicted (p<0.05), ∆DLco = -10.0±18.4% of predicted
(p<0.005), ∆6-min-walk distance = -37.3±120.9 m (p=0.20),
∆lowest saturation during 6-min walk test = -4.0±6.5% (p<
0.005), ∆ground-glass score on HRCT = 2.6±11.2 (p<0.05),
and ∆reticular score on HRCT = 6.4±8.0 (p<0.0001). When
correlations between changes in HRCT scores and those in
pulmonary function tests, including VC and DLco, were ex￾amined, no significant correlations were found (data not
shown).
Correlations between changes in clinical variables and
those in each SF-36 domain are presented in Table 3.
Changes in the serum level of KL-6 did not significantly
correlate with changes in any domain. With respect to physi￾ological parameters, changes in VC as a percent of predicted
were significantly correlated with those of PF, BP, GH and
VT, and changes in DLco as a percent of predicted were
significantly correlated with those of PF, BP and GH.
Within-subject changes in distance in the 6-min-walk were
significantly correlated with changes in 4 items, i.e., BP,
GH, VT and MH; these were most highly correlated with
changes in GH (ρ=0.61, p<0.01). Change in the lowest oxy￾gen saturation during the 6-min-walk was significantly cor￾related with changes in PF and GH. With regard to HRCT
scores, changes in the ground-glass score were significantly
correlated with changes in BP, GH and MH, and changes in
the reticular score were significantly correlated with those of
GH. There were no significant correlations between changes
in 3 domains (RP, SF and RE) and those of any of the clini￾cal parameters examined.
When within-subject changes in each SF-36 domain were
compared between two subgroups divided according to
clinical parameters, the following results were obtained.
First, declines in PF, BP and VT were significantly more se￾vere in subjects whose VC decreased by ≧10% (worsening
of VC) than in subjects whose VC did not (stable or im￾proved VC) (p<0.05, respectively) (Table 4). Second, de￾clines in PF (p<0.005), BP (p<0.05), GH (p<0.05) and VT
(p<0.05) were significantly more severe in subjects whose
DLco decreased by ≧15% (worsening of DLco) than in
those without such a decrease (stable or improved DLco)
(Table 5). Third, deterioration in PF and GH (p<0.05, re￾spectively) were significantly more severe in subjects whose
lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test de￾creased by ≧4 percentage points than in subjects without
such a decrease (Table 6). Finally, deterioration in PF (p<
0.05), GH (p<0.05), VT (p<0.005), SF (p<0.01) and MH (p
<0.05) was significantly more severe in subjects who devel￾oped the need for supplemental oxygen during the follow-up
than in subjects who did not (Table 7). When scores for
each SF-36 subscale before and after introduction of home
oxygen therapy in these 4 patients were compared, signifi￾cant declines were found as follows: ∆PF=-36.1±18.8 (p<

Discussion
This is the first longitudinal study of HRQL in IPF pa￾tients showing impaired HRQL in both physical and psycho￾logical functions when compared with the general popula￾tion and that scores in a few physical domains worsened
significantly over time. Some clinical parameters were sig￾nificantly related to the HRQL scores in the cross-sectional
study and changes in scores in the longitudinal study; how￾ever, the HRQL and its longitudinal changes were incom￾pletely predicted by these clinical parameters.
When evaluating HRQL for a specific disease, both ge￾neric questionnaires and disease-specific questionnaires are
available. In the present study, we chose the SF-36, a ge￾neric HRQL instrument, due to its relative simplicity, wide
use in chronic pulmonary disease, and availability of a vali￾dated version for the Japanese population. Although disease￾specific questionnaires are likely to be more sensitive to par￾ticular symptoms and to slight responses to therapeutic in￾terventions than are generic measures, the advantage of
disease-specific measures is not frequently proven (3, 20,
21). However, there is no disease-specific instrument for use
in patients with IPF. Investigators have noted problems with
some of the existing non-IPF respiratory disease-specific in￾struments when applied to patients with IPF. Developing an
IPF-specific instrument that includes items most relevant to
IPF patients would be ideal for evaluating the real HRQL in
IPF (2).
There are a few cross-sectional studies (3, 5-8) of IPF pa￾tients that used the SF-36, although one study (3) included
interstitial lung diseases other than IPF such as nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis, or asbestosis. As did
these studies, we also demonstrated that using national-norm
characteristics our patients with IPF had significantly im￾paired HRQL in both physical and psychological function￾ing. Although Martinez et al (5) and Ohno et al (8) reported
that IPF patients and control subjects had similar scores
only for the BP component, all of the 8 domains, including
BP, were significantly below the national reference values in
our patients.
Although longitudinal assessments are needed to map the
trajectory of HRQL in relation to disease progression and to
reveal whether different aspects of HRQL become impaired
over time (2), such assessments in IPF patients have yet to
be performed. In our longitudinal study, we found clear evi￾dence of a measurable and progressive deterioration in the
physical aspects of quality of life of this population. Particu￾larly, PF showed remarkable aggravation, so it is possible
that the PF domain is the initial health component to decline
in patients with IPF, as in patients with COPD (22). Further￾more, there were significant differences in within-subject
changes in a few SF-36 domains when subjects were di￾vided according to changes in physiologic parameters. Our
results showed that PF was very sensitive to the deteriora￾tion of physiologic clinical parameters assessed by VC,
DLco and desaturation during exercise. As the SF-36 has
been reported to be responsive to changes in quality of life
in COPD (23, 24) or asthma (25), it also demonstrated sen￾sitivity to changes in IPF in the present study.
Longitudinal studies also provide a platform for evaluat￾ing how IPF patients adapt to disease (2). From the present

DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.46.6218
1541
longitudinal study showing that all of the psychosocial do￾mains revealed no significant aggravation over time despite
results of the cross-sectional study that showed significantly
lower scores than the national norm, it is indicated that an
individual’s assessment of HRQL might change over time.
The present results showed that not only the physical
function domains (PF and GH) but also the psychosocial do￾mains (VT, SF, and MH) deteriorated more severely in sub￾jects who developed the need for supplemental oxygen com￾pared with those in subjects who did not (Table 7). Of
course, these patients started long-term oxygen therapy due
to the progression of the disease. Although further examina￾tion is necessary as to the usefulness of long-term oxygen
therapy in IPF, it is possible that supplemental oxygen use
does not attenuate the decline of HRQL in patients with IPF.
It is reported that long-term oxygen therapy does not affect
quality of life in patients with COPD (26).
Since HRQL is an important outcome in IPF manage￾ment, we examined various clinical parameters to identify
factors that were correlated with HRQL and its longitudinal
changes. The cross-sectional correlations between clinical
parameters and HRQL observed in this study are similar to
those reported in the literature (3, 5, 7, 8). In the present
study, VC as percent of predicted showed a significant cor￾relation with 6 subscales and its changes were significantly
correlated with those of 4 subscales. It appears as if VC
covers a significant part of the HRQL of IPF patients in
both cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments. The
analyses of efficacy endpoints in the large multicenter con￾trolled trial of interferon-γ1b for IPF revealed that a decre￾ment in the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity
represents a valid measure of disease progression (27).
Therefore, these longitudinal measurements are important
from the viewpoint of both length and quality of life in IPF
patients.
The 6-min-walk distance was significantly correlated with
3 subscales, with the correlation greatest with the PF do￾main. In addition, its changes were significantly correlated
with those in 4 subscales, suggesting that this measurement
reflected a change of those HRQL domains comparatively
well. In the same way, the lowest oxygen saturation showed
a significant correlation with 3 subscales and its changes
were significantly correlated with those of 2 subscales. To
our knowledge, there has been no report on the relationship
between desaturation during the 6-min-walk test and HRQL
in IPF patients. Interestingly, the lowest oxygen saturation
was significantly correlated with psychological functions
such as SF or MH, and in contrast, the 6-min-walk distance
was significantly correlated with physical functions such as
PF or RP. Desaturation during the 6-min-walk might be re￾lated to the psychological aspects of HRQL. Nishiyama and
coworkers (9) also reported a significant relationship be￾tween the lowest saturation during a cycle ergometer exer￾cise test and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire
scores. It is possible that desaturation during exercise affects
the HRQL of patients with IPF. Exercise physiology mea￾surements are important to predict the impairment of HRQL
of IPF patients, as with COPD (20).
Although HRCT scanning has come to play a central role
in the diagnosis and assessment of the clinical course of
IPF, previous studies in this field did not use this modality.
Semiquantitative assessment of disease extent by HRCT fol￾lowing the method of Xaubet et al (15), which correlates
with the evidence of physiological impairment, including
forced vital capacity and DLco, was performed to evaluate
the impact of the HRCT findings on HRQL of IPF patients.
However, the present results suggested that HRCT scanning
was not so useful in predicting impairment and longitudinal
changes in HRQL of IPF patients because it showed only
correlations with a few SF-36 domains, and the magnitude
of those correlations was weak in comparison with physi￾ological parameters.
In addition to the above-mentioned clinical variables, we
examined KL-6, the recently developed serum marker for
interstitial lung diseases. However, the present results sug￾gested that KL-6 was not useful in predicting impairment of
HRQL or its longitudinal changes in IPF patients. Ohno and
coworkers (8) also reported no correlation between SF-36
scores and KL-6 values.
From these observations, although some conventional
clinical parameters correlated with HRQL and its change,
the magnitude of these correlations was moderate to weak.
Therefore, these clinical parameters, even when HRCT scan￾ning is included, should not be used in place of measuring
HRQL directly. HRQL has come to be recognized as an im￾portant parameter for measuring the impact and progression
of chronic diseases, including IPF (2-9). Therefore, these re￾sults indicate that HRQL instruments should be incorporated
into routine evaluations of IPF patients.
The present study has some limitations. First, the study
was limited to one medical center, so the small sample size
weakens the power of the study. Second, in this longitudinal
study the management of patients varied, so we could not
address the impact of drug therapy on HRQL. Limited at￾tempts have been made to evaluate HRQL as an outcome
measure in clinical trials of IPF. Investigators using The St.
George Respiratory Questionnaire (28), Chronic Respiratory
Disease Questionnaire (29) and the SF-36 (18) found no dif￾ference in HRQL between control and treatment groups.
Any of the following 3 possibilities could explain the lack
of a significant change in HRQL scores: (1) the investiga￾tional drug truly had no effect on HRQL; (2) the study was
not adequately powered to detect a significant change in
HRQL; or (3) the instrument was not sensitive to detect a
true change in HRQL (2). The present study showed that the
SF-36 was responsive to changes in HRQL in IPF, so a ma￾jor focus of future research should include improvement of
the SF-36 score as a study endpoint. Third, our study lacked
an evaluation of dyspnea, which may be more useful to pre￾dict the impairment of HRQL in IPF patients than the clini￾cal parameters mentioned above. Across the 4 studies (3, 5,
6, 9) that examined IPF, dyspnea correlated better with

HRQL than any other disease symptom or measure of clini￾cal severity.
In conclusion, patients with IPF had significantly im￾paired HRQL in both physical and psychological functions.
This disease clearly decreased the physical aspects of quality
of life over time. HRQL instruments should be incorporated
into routine evaluations of IPF patients, since they measure
dimensions not fully estimated by clinical assessment even
when HRCT is used.
