SUMMARY
The presence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to multiple 
infections has been reported, predominantly viral, 
but also bacterial and fungal. It is well known that 
COVID-19 can present a wide variety of complications 
during the course of infection; however, the presence 
of rhabdomyolysis as an initial condition has not been 
reported so far. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis as 
an initial presentation in a patient diagnosed with SARS￾CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
2) infection.
BACKGROUND
Rhabdomyolysis is defined as a dissolution of skel￾etal muscle, with acute kidney injury (AKI) as the 
most important and comorbid complication, espe￾cially in severe cases. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 
infection can have a wide variety of complications 
during the course of infection. Pulmonary, cardio￾vascular and thrombotic complications have been 
widely reported. The present case reports a patient 
diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respira￾tory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection presenting 
with rhabdomyolysis.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 71-year-old man, who had a history of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia and of smoking 20 ciga￾rettes a day for the past 30 years, presented to the 
emergency department with a 1-week history of 
dry coughing, mild dyspnoea and a fever of 38°C 
that did not resolve with paracetamol. Two weeks 
previously, he had returned to Mexico City from 
Miami. On the day of his admission, he felt greater 
dyspnoea and was suffering from severe myalgia 
and arthralgia, predominantly in his legs.
At his initial evaluation, the patient reported 
generalised weakness and malaise. He did not report 
any nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, urinary or neuro￾logical symptoms. He had not taken any medica￾tion except paracetamol (750mg) every 8hours to 
control the fever. He had no known allergies.
A physical examination revealed a blood pressure 
of 120/68 mmHg, a pulse of 90 beats/min and a 
respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. His tempera￾ture was 36.5°C and his oxygen saturation was 
84% while breathing ambient air. He was alert and 
oriented, but his speech was slow and pausing. A 
cardiopulmonary examination revealed rales in 
both lung bases, but without signs of respiratory 
distress. Otherwise, his physical examination was 
unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Blood tests showed a normal leucocyte count 
with lymphopaenia (0.85 ×109
/L), haemo￾globin level (161g/L) and mild thrombocyto￾paenia (118000×109
/L). His creatinine level was 
increased, at 1.68mg/dL, and his C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were elevated, at 
2.9mg/dL and 2.89ng/mL, respectively. His inter￾leukin (IL)-6 was also increased (233pg/mL). His 
muscle enzymes were markedly elevated (creatine 
phosphokinase at 8720 U/L and myoglobin at 2079 
ng/mL). His ferritin and lactic dehydrogenase levels 
were high as well (at 2603ng/mL and 541U/L, 
respectively). A urinalysis showed haemoglobin 
without erythrocytes in the sediment microscopy 
(table 1). A nasopharyngaeal swab for SARS-CoV2 
was positive. Multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses 
and HIV test were negative. A lung CT scan showed 
bilateral infiltrates with areas of consolidation and 
extensive ground-glass opacities.
TREATMENT
The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 ward 
and administered oxygen by nasal cannula. We 
started aggressive fluid and bicarbonate therapy as 
well as enoxaparin, azithromycin and ceftriaxone. 
The patient agreed to the use of compassionate 
drug therapy, so we started him on hydroxychlo￾roquine and lopinavir/ritonavir. His condition 
deteriorated on the third day of hospitalisation and 
he required invasive mechanical ventilation. Over 
the next 2days, his condition continued to dete￾riorate, with fever, hypotension and high ventila￾tory requirements. His CRP and IL-6 levels also 
increased (to 26.9mg/dL and 275pg/mL, respec￾tively). His family agreed to the use of tocilizumab 
on a compassionate use scheme. Consequently, we 
gave him two doses of tocilizumab 400mg intrave￾nous on the fifth and sixth day after admission.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
On the seventh day after admission, his condition 
started to improve and he showed a decrease in 
lactic dehydrogenase, ferritin, CRP and PCT levels. 
It was possible to extubate him on the 12th day 
after admission. His clinical condition continued to 
improve and after a negative SARS-CoV2 test, we

were able to finally discharge him to his home on the 16th day 
after admission.
DISCUSSION
This case illustrates that rhabdomyolysis could be related to 
SARS-CoV2 infection and could be a presenting problem in 
patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia, rather than being 
only a late complication, as was previously reported.1
 In a large 
series of COVID-19 patients, Guan et al reported two cases of 
rhabdomyolysis in non-severe cases. However, the study does not 
clarify specificities about the patients.2
 Likewise, Suwanwongse 
et al described a case of a patient with non-severe COVID-19 
pneumonia with rhabdomyolysis as a presenting feature and 
Gefen et al described the first paediatric patient with rhabdomy￾olysis and non-severe COVID-19 infection.3 4
Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with viral infections and 
especially influenza.5
 It has also been reported in association 
with SARS.6
 Our patient presented with clinical and biochemical 
evidence of rhabdomyolysis before he was started on any drug or 
had been placed on paralytic therapy for mechanical ventilation, 
which are known causes of muscular injury.7
A recent report of renal histopathological features in post￾mortem COVID-19 patients found pigmented cast in three 
cases; the authors stated that drug-relevant or hyperventilation￾relevant rhabdomyolysis contributed, although they did not 
rule out a possible direct viral injury on muscle.8
 However, 
SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in multiple tissues as kidneys, 
liver, brain and heart, which could suggest that the virus could 
also infect striated muscle tissue.9
 In our case, the patient also 
presented with AKI possibly associated with rhabdomyolysis 
because the urinalysis had haemoglobin without red blood cells 
in the sediment.
Although high PCT is associated with severe bacterial infec￾tions,10 it has also been related to other conditions as pancre￾atitis, burn injury, mechanical trauma and rhabdomyolysis.11
Our patient presented with a high serum PCT without a proven 
bacterial infection. It is possible that the PCT level was associated 
with the COVID-19 infection severity and the rhabdomyolysis.12
Luckily, our patient responded well, and although tocilizumab 
use is anecdotic, the patient’s temporal sequence could suggest a 
possible positive role.
Learning points
► Rhabdomyolysis can be the initial presentation of COVID-19.
► High creatine kinase level could be related to rhabdomyolysis 
and acute kidney injury, which requires an aggressive 
treatment to prevent further complications.
► Rhabdomyolysis and COVID-19 infection can be associated 
with an increased procalcitonin level without a bacterial 
infection.
