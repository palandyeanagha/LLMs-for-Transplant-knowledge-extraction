Skeletal muscle blood flow and neurovascular
reactivity in liver disease1
MICHAEL LUNZER, S. P. NEWMAN, AND SHEILA SHERLOCK
From the Departments ofMedicine andPhysics, Royal Free Hospital, London
SUMMARY There was no significant difference in forearm muscle blood flow, measured by the
clearance of 133Xenon when 38 patients with liver disease were compared with 38 normal subjects.
Patients with a clinically hyperdynamic circulation, finger clubbing, and previous portocaval
anastomoses were included in the study.
The changes in forearm skeletal muscle blood flow and pulse rate caused by a head-up tilt of
70 degrees were measured in 15 patients with chronic liver disease and 15 age-matched controls.
Head-up tilting resulted in significantly less peripheral vasoconstriction and tachycardia in the group
with liver disease than in the control group.
These results suggest an impairment of baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic reactivity in liver
disease. Such a defect might explain the relative rarity of hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.
A hyperdynamic circulation is often found in
patients with liver disease (Kontos, Shapiro, Page
Mauck, and Patterson, 1964; Murray, Dawson, and
Sherlock, 1958) and increased blood flow to the hand
has been demonstrated in cirrhosis (Abramson and
Lichtman, 1937; Martini and Hagemann, 1956).
As it is generally accepted that blood flow to the
hand is almost entirely cutaneous (Kontos et al,
1964), skin blood flow would appear to be increased
in liver disease.
The major components of forearm blood flow in
normal subjects at rest are those to skin and skeletal
muscle (Cooper, Edholm, and Mottram, 1955).
Kontos et a! (1964) have presented indirect evidence
that in some patients with cirrhosis there are in￾creases in both muscle and skin blood flow whereas
in others only one of these two components is
increased. However, there has been no direct
evaluation of skeletal muscle blood flow in liver
disease.
The factors responsible for the circulatory changes
of liver disease are unknown, many unsuccessful
attempts having been made to identify a humoral
vasodilator substance. We have investigated neuro￾vascular responsiveness in patients with chronic
liver disease in order to determine a possible alter-

native explanation for these circulatory changes.
Head-up tilting from the horizontal position is a
powerful stimulus to the baroreceptors in the low
pressure vascular compartments in the chest. Firing
of these baroreceptors results in reflex vasoconstric￾tion of blood vessels in the forearm and a con￾comitant tachycardia. These reflexes are transmitted
via the sympathetic nervous system.
Methods
Skeletal muscle blood flow was measured using the
technique of Lassen (Lassen, Lindbjerg, and Munck,
1964). All subjects were supine and had neither
eaten nor smoked for at least two hours. Studies
were performed at room temperature (23-26°C).
133Xenon gas, 150-250 ,Ci, dissolved in not more
than 0.15 ml of saline was injected directly into the
brachioradialis muscle. The injection was given
over a 15-second period and the needle left in situ
for a further 15 seconds. At least 15 minutes was
allowed to elapse before recording was commenced.
The clearance of xenon was monitored by a
scintillation detector connected to a rate meter with
a three-second time constant and thence to a poten￾tiometric chart recorder.
The clearance curve was replotted on log-linear
graph paper as a straight line and the best-fit slope
was found using linear regression analysis.
Skeletal muscle blood flow in ml 100 g-' min-1 was
calculated from the formula 100 AK, where A is the

partition coefficient for xenon between muscle and
blood, and K, the slope of the best-fit line, is the
fraction of activity cleared from the forearm per
unit time.
In the second part of the study skeletal muscle
blood flow was measured with the subject horizontal
and repeated with the subject tilted head-up at an
angle of 70 degrees to the horizontal. Count rates at
30-second intervals were recorded on a digital rate
meter and were used to calculate skeletal muscle
blood flow before and after tilting using linear
regression analysis. A few recordings with regression
coefficients of less than 0.975 were discarded. Pulse
rates were measured immediately before and after
tilting.
Results
Resting skeletal muscle blood flow was estimated in
38 patients with liver disease and 38 controls.
The control group was composed of 11 normal
volunteers, 12 patients admitted for minor surgical
procedures, and 15 patients with various medical
conditions unrelated to the liver. The mean age of
this group was 39.7 (SD 12.6) years.
The composition of the group with liver disease
was as follows:
Cryptogenic cirrhosis .14
Chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. 6
Primary biliary cirrhosis .5
Alcoholic cirrhosis 3
Alcoholic hepatitis 2
Subacute hepatitis 2
Chronic intrahepatic cholestasis. 2
Fatty liver of pregnancy. 1
Chronic persistent hepatitis 1
Halothane hepatitis 1
Viral hepatitis. 1
The mean age of this group was 41.3 years (SD 13.8).
The mean resting skeletal muscle blood flow in
the control group was 1P48 ml 100 g muscle-'
minute-' (SD 0.56) while the group with liver
disease had a mean flow of 1*40 ml 100 g muscle-'
minute-' (SD 0.51). There was no significant
difference in blood flow between the two groups
(p between 0.4 and 0.5) (fig 1).
The group with liver disease included patients with
clinically hyperdynamic circulations, finger clubbing,
and previous portocaval anastomoses (fig 2). Muscle
blood flow was not increased in these groups and, if
anything, was decreased in the patients with finger
clubbing.
The changes in skeletal muscle blood flow and
pulse rate due to head-up tilting were measured in
15 patients with chronic liver disease and 15 age￾25.

matched controls (see table). The changes in flow are
shown diagrammatically in fig 3 and expressed as
percentage decreases in figure 4. There was no
history of excessive alcohol consumption in the
patients with liver disease, nor was there any clinical
evidence of diabetes or peripheral neuropathy. No
subjects were receiving drugs known to affect
peripheral blood flow or impair vasoconstriction.
There was a highly significant difference between
the two groups, the patients with liver disease
showing less vasoconstriction than the control
subjects (p < 0.001).
Radial pulse rates before and after vertical tilting
showed a highly significant difference between the
two groups, patients with liver disease showing less
tachycardia in response to tilting than the control
group (p < 0O001) (fig 5 and fig 6).
Discussion
Clinical stigmata of liver disease thought to be related
to peripheral vasodilatation include warm ex￾tremities, bounding pulses, haemic ejection murmurs,
spider angiomata, and clubbing of the fingers.
The increased cardiac output and decreased
peripheral resistance of other 'high-output states',
such as thyrotoxicosis and arteriovenous fistulae,
have been well described in patients with cirrhosis
(Murray et al, 1958; Kowalski and Abelmann, 1953).
However, 'high-output' cardiac failure appears to
be distinctly uncommon in liver disease (Sherlock,
1971).
It was the expectation of previous authors that in
patients with liver disease there would be increases

358 Michael Lunzer, S. P. Newman, and Sheila Sherlock
(Kontos et al, 1964; Abramson, Fierst, and Flachs,
1943). However, we have shown forearm skeletal
muscle blood flow to be normal in patients with
various forms of liver disease, suggesting that the
peripheral vasodilatation is entirely cutaneous in
origin.
The patients with a clinically hyperdynamic cir￾culation and finger clubbing, signs that have usually
been associated with a high total peripheral blood
flow (Kontos et al, 1964; Martini and Hagemann,
1956), did not show an increase in skeletal muscle
blood flow (fig 2). Ginsburg (1958) has shown that
in some patients with clubbing due to hypertrophic
pulmonary osteoarthropathy flow in the forearm
and calf is increased, whilst that of the resting hand
and foot is normal. This suggests that skeletal muscle
blood flow is increased in such patients in contrast
to our findings in patients with cirrhosis. Several
mechanisms responsible for clubbing have been
suggested and it is possible that the factors involved
are different in the two diseases. The large internal
diversion of venous blood created by portocaval
anastomoses did not appear to affect skeletal muscle
blood flow.
When the normal subject is tilted from the supine
to the erect posture there is a decrease in forearm
blood flow and an increase in pulse rate that do not
occur in the sympathectomized forearm (Brigden,
Howarth, and Sharpey-Schafer, 1950). These reflexes
are thought to be transmitted by thoracic barorecep￾tors via the sympathetic nervous system.
In 1956 Sharpey-Schafer demonstrated the ab￾sence of baroreceptor reflexes in patients suffering
from tabes dorsalis (Sharpey-Schafer, 1956). Sub￾sequently impaired vasoconstrictor responses
following vertical tilting or lower body negative
pressure have been described in a variety of disorders
including orthostatic hypotension (Bannister, Ardill,
and Fentem, 1967; Burns, Downey, Frewin, and
Whelan, 1971), peripheral neuritis (Barraclough and
Sharpey-Schafer, 1963), diabetes (Odel, Roth, and
Keating, 1955), Parkinson's syndrome (Appenzeller
and Goss, 1971), and chronic hypoxaemia (Heistad,
Abboud, Mark, and Schmid, 1972).
It has been emphasized that defective circulatory
reflexes are most likely to be associated with hypo￾tension if there is acute interruption of the reflex and
that with a chronic baroreceptor block hypotension
may only develop with a reduction in blood volume
(Barraclough and Sharpey-Schafer, 1963). Plasma
volume is frequently increased in patients with
cirrhosis (Eisenberg, 1956; McCloy, Baldus, Tauxe,
and Summerskill, 1967) and this increase may exert
a protective influence against the development of
symptomatic hypotension. Severe hepatic failure
may, however, be associated with hypotension and
in these cases the plasma volume is often reduced.
The finding of hypertension among patients with
chronic liver disease is very unusual (Loyke, 1955;
Loyke, 1962a; Spatt and Rosenblatt, 1949) and
previous hypertension has been found to revert to
normal blood pressure with the development of
cirrhosis (Loyke, 1962b).
Our results suggest that patients with chronic
liver disease have an impairment of peripheral
vasoconstriction. Such a defect may be responsible
for the peripheral vasodilatation and the relative
rarity of hypertension in patients with liver disease.
It may also contribute to the development of hypo￾tension in severe hepatic failure.
Recent work by Fischer and his colleagues
(Fischer and Baldessarini, 1971; Fischer and James,
1972) has suggested that some of the neurological
and cardiovascular complications of hepatic failure
might be explained by the accumulation of false
adrenergic neurochemical transmitters. It is pos￾tulated that 'false neurotransmitters' replace the
physiological transmitters, noradrenaline and
dopamine, in the nerve endings and that stimulation
of these nerve endings results in release of less active
transmitters with consequent diminution in the
response of the effector organ. Such an hypothesis
could explain a defect in sympathetic vasocon￾striction in liver disease as noradrenergic transmission
is required for this reflex.
