he new Japanese legislation for organ transplantation 
from brain death donors was established in October 
1996, and 49 heart transplants have been performed 
in Japan to the end of 2007.1,2 At the National Cardiovas￾cular Center, 22 patients received heart transplants during 
the same period. Of the first 2 patients, 1 had the standard 
biatrial anastomosis technique (BAAT) and the other under￾went the original bicaval anastomosis technique (BCAT).2
The following 20 consecutive patients underwent transplan￾tation using a modified BCAT (mBCAT) developed at our 
center.3 At present, nearly 70% of heart transplant operations 
in Japan use this technique, probably because of its easy 
applicability and some advantages.4 We report the results of 
a mid-term hemodynamic and echocardiographic evaluation 
of 20 consecutive patients who have undergone heart trans￾plantation using the mBCAT. We also compare our results 
with previously published functional results of different 
transplant techniques.

Methods
The 20 consecutive patients comprised 14 males and 6 
females, ranging in age from 14 to 61 years, with a mean of 
41±11 years; the body surface area (BSA) varied from 1.35 
to 1.83m2 (mean 1.60±0.16m2). The diagnosis confirmed by 
pathological examination of the recipients’ original heart was 
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 17 patients, 
dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 1 and 
cardiac sarcoidosis in 2. Preoperatively, 5 patients had a 
pacemaker and 2 had an implantable cardiac defibrillator 
(ICD); 18 (90%) patients had had a left ventricular assist 
device (LVAD) before transplantation and the remaining 2 
patients had been on multiple inotropic agents, requiring 
intensive care. Consequently, all 20 patients were in the 
status 1 category. Most LVAD implantations were preceded 
by insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump, and the LVAD 
was a Toyobo type for 16 patients and a HeartMate VX 
device for 2. The average waiting time for transplantation 
from the time of registration with the Japan Organ Trans￾plant Network and that of heart transplantation varied from 
59 to 2,748 days, with a mean of 947±697 days, and the 
period on LVAD was 702±366 days, varying from 99 to 
1,444 days.
Pre- and postoperative cardiac dimensions were assessed 
by ultrasound cardiography, and hemodynamics were evalu￾ated by cardiac catheterization using a Swan-Ganz catheter.

Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and echocardiographic function of 
hearts transplanted with the modified bicaval anastomosis technique (mBCAT).
Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients (14 males, 6 females, age range 14–61 [41.3±11.5 years]) 
were evaluated 3.4±2.2 years after heart transplantation using the mBCAT. All patients were in status I on the 
waiting list, and 18 (90%) had had a left ventricular assist device. The donor age was 39±12 years. Triple immu￾nosuppressive regimen and cardiac biopsy were routinely performed. There was no hospital mortality. One death 
occurred 4.2 years after the operation because of bone marrow dysplasia and infection. The 8-year survival was 
89% (95% confidence interval: 0.43–0.98). All the hemodynamic variables returned to the normal range. Low 
right atrial pressure (3.2±1.5mmHg) and low pulmonary wedge pressure (6.7±2.1mmHg) were associated with 
an excellent cardiac index (3.9±0.7L·min–1·m–2). Echocardiography revealed an excellent late peak velocity 
(52±19cm/s) and an E/A ratio (1.4±0.6) of tricuspid flow. The grade (0–4) of tricuspid regurgitation averaged 
1.5±0.8.
Conclusions: Hemodynamic and echocardiographic results for mBCAT were excellent. The 8-year survival 
was 89% with all surviving patients in New York Heart Association class I. The mBCAT is easy to perform and 
further facilitates cardiac transplantation.  (Circ J 2009; 73: 1235–1239)

Assessment of the pre-transplant hemodynamics and plasma 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was performed prior 
to LVAD installment. Post-transplant studies were done 
3.4±2.2 years after operation. The demographics of the 20 
patients are listed in Table 1.
Operation
Donor Heart Procurement  The age of the donors aver￾aged 39±12 years, ranging from 18 to 54 years. The donor 
hearts were recovered at various locations in Japan and 
usually transported by jet charter flight unless they were 
retrieved at a near-by hospital in which case road transport 
was used. For the most of recent patients (80%), Celsior 
solution5 was used for both cardioplegic arrest during 
extraction and storage during transportation, whereas for the 
initial 4 patients in this series, St Thomas solution was used.2
The total ischemic time from cardiac extraction to aortic 
declamping at the final stage of the transplant procedures 
varied from 137 to 255min with a mean of 207±26min.
Transplant Procedure  The transplantation procedure 
used in the present series was the mBCAT, reported by us 
in 2000.3 Briefly, the posterior right atrial (RA) wall is left 
undivided as a cuff connecting the superior (SVC) and infe￾rior venae cavae (IVC), as illustrated in Figure 1. Without 
complete division and separation of the SVC and IVC their 
anatomical orientation is well maintained and the distance 
required for the graft tissue to fit exactly between them is 
easily judged, thereby avoiding traction, kinking or distor￾tion of either of the vessels. This modification is particularly 
useful when there is a size mismatch between the donor and 
recipient hearts.
Postoperative Management and Episodes of Rejection
Triple immunosuppressive regimen was routinely used. All 
patients, except 4 (80%), started with Neoral (cyclosporine

A), Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil), and prednisone.6
Prograf (tacrolimus) was selected as the first calcineurin 
inhibitor in 4 patients, mainly to enhance our clinical expe￾rience with this drug. Serum concentrations of cyclosporine 
A, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were routinely 
monitored to facilitate dose adjustment.7
Endomyocardial biopsy was performed according to 
schedule in the usual manner. Rejection was judged micro￾scopically, based on the criteria of the 1990 report of the 
International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation8 with 
reference to the 2004 revision.9 Rejection episodes greater 
than grade 2 occurred 1.1±1.4 times per patient during the 
follow-up. Rejection of more than 3A was identified in 2.7% 
of 340 biopsy specimens from the 20 patients, and was 
successfully controlled by steroid pulse therapy, switching 
cyclosporine A to tacrolimus or a combination.
Statistical Analysis
Values are mean±standard deviation. Pre- and post trans￾plant cardiac dimensions and function in each patient were 
compared by paired t-test. Survival was calculated by the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences were judged statistically 
significant at P<0.05.

Results
Survival
There were no operative or hospital deaths and all patients 
were successfully discharged from hospital. A 59-year-old 
male patient died 4 years and 2 months after transplantation. 
His postoperative course was complicated by dysplasia of 
the bone marrow and cytomegalovirus gastric ulcer requir￾ing an emergency gastrectomy. The final cause of death was 
pneumonia. The remaining 19 patients were all doing well 
in New York Heart Association class I, and the Kaplan￾Meier survival rate up to 8 years was 89% (95% confidence 
interval 43–98) (Figure 2). No one required a pacemaker 
or ICD implantation after transplantation.
Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Assessments
The hemodynamic and echocardiographic assessments 
of the heart before and after transplantation are shown 
in Tables 2,3. After transplantation, all cardiac function 
parameters and dimensions completely returned to normal. 
Preoperative and post-transplant differences in the hemody￾namic and echocardiographic variables were all markedly 
significant at P<0.001, except for heart rate (P=0.089) and 
pulmonary vascular resistance (P=0.25). All patients were in 
normal sinus rhythm. The mean RA pressure in the mBCAT 
patients was 3.2±1.5mmHg. There were no measurable 
pressure gradients between the SVC or IVC and the RA. 
The late peak velocity of tricuspid flow was 52±19cm/s 
and the E/A ratios of tricuspid and mitral flow were 1.4±0.6 
and 2.2±0.7, respectively. The incidence of moderate to 
severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (TVR) was 5%, with a 
mean grade of 1.5±0.8 (range 0–3). In 1 patient in this series, 
chordal injury of the tricuspid valve accidentally occurred 
at the time of endomyocardial biopsy, which resulted in 
grade 3 TVR. The pre-transplant plasma level of BNP was 
725±291pg/ml (range 342–1,099) and it was significantly 
reduced to 55±49 pg/ml (range 5–172), postoperatively 
(P<0.0001).
Discussion
Orthotropic heart transplantation is a well-established 
treatment for end-stage heart failure and the post-transplant 
recovery of patients is dramatic. Although life-long care for 
the control of rejection and infection is necessary, this has 
significantly improved in recent years. As shown in this 
study, the grade of hemodynamic improvement with heart 
transplantation was really excellent, with a resultant 8-year 
survival of 89%, in contrast to that for left ventricular res￾toration surgery for congestive heart failure because of 
DCM.10
On the other hand, operative techniques for heart trans￾plantation have not changed significantly from the original 
BAAT developed in the experimental era by Shumway, 
Lower, and Stofer.11 The only option to the standard BAAT 
is the BCAT developed by Dreyfus et al.12 Multiple com￾parisons of these surgical techniques have been conducted 
to date,13–17 most of which favor the BCAT because the 
well-maintained RA architecture and function (contraction) 
reduces the incidence of TVR.
The hemodynamic and echocardiographic data for our 
patients undergoing the mBCAT resembled those previously 
reported for the original BCAT.13–17 The values for RA, right 
ventricular, pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressures in our series agreed with those obtained 
after BCAT and reported by El-Gamel et al,13 Aziz et al,14
Traversi et al,15 and Sun et al.16 The RA pressure was always 
lower with the BCAT than with the BAAT. The increased 
late diastolic tricuspid flow (52±19cm/s) in the present 
patients after the mBCAT was similar to that with the BCAT 
(48±18cm/s) reported by Sun et al16 and clearly indicated 
more vigorous RA contraction followed by better RA and 
right ventricular relaxation with the BCAT or mBCAT. 
Also, the E/A ratio of tricuspid flow in our patients (1.4±0.6) 
was close to that with BCAT in Traversi et al’s series (1.2±
0.5).15 The incidence of moderate to severe TVR was as low 
as 5%, with a mean grade of 1.5±0.8 (range 0–3), and that 
of mitral regurgitation was essentially none, and there has 
been no requirement for pacemaker implantation in any of 
the patients from this series. Accidental chordal damage of 
the tricuspid valve at the time of endomyocardial biopsy is 
an important causative factor for significant TVR, and 
occurred in 1 patient in this series, causing acute onset of 
grade 3 TVR (5%). The biopsy specimen contained a piece 
of the chordal tissue. Otherwise, the grade of TVR has been 
mild and stable to date in this series.
The adverse impact of significant TVR on mortality or 
the need for re-transplantation has also been stressed in 
pediatric heart transplantation,18 and prophylactic donor 
tricuspid annuloplasty by the DeVega method in order to 
prevent post transplant TVR was recently reported to be 
effective in decreasing cardiac-related mortality.19 In addi￾tion, some previous articles15,16,19 strongly suggested bene￾fits of the BCAT that contribute to a reduction in long-term 
cardiac-related mortality. However, 2 recent papers dealing 
with the same subject either by conducting a systemic review 
and meta-analysis20 or by analyzing the UNOS database21
reached a similar conclusion, namely, that both the BCAT 
and BAAT lead to equivalent survival, and that the long￾term beneficial effects, such as exercise capacity and health￾related quality of life, remain to be evaluated. Nevertheless, 
both reports again admit the clinically relevant beneficial 
effects of the BCAT in comparison with the standard 
BAAT.
Although this was an observational study and it is diffi￾cult to demonstrate the superiority of the mBCAT compared 
with the original BCAT, which was performed in only 
1 patient2 not included in this series, clinical outcomes, 
including the survival rate up to 8 years, were excellent with 
similar hemodynamic and echocardiographic results to those 
previously reported for the BCAT.13–17 With this modified 
technique, there have been no adverse effects attributable to

leaving a strip of the posterior wall of the right atrium. The 
mBCAT has been accepted as an easy alternative in nearly 
70% of orthotopic heart transplantation in Japan.4 The 
mBCAT can prevent some technical disadvantages encoun￾tered with the original BCAT, such as shrinkage, retraction 
and distortion of the SVC and IVC, with no additional 
operating time required. Moreover, we often found that the 
anastomosis could be carried out with ease in cases of mis￾matched donor–recipient hearts because we could create a 
large anastomotic orifice by expanding the suture line into 
the preserved posterior wall of the right atrium when the 
donor heart was large or we could easily adjust the distance 
between the SVC and IVC when the donor heart was small. 
There have been no episodes of caval anastomotic stenosis22
in our series. In conclusion, this modification further facili￾tates techniques for transplantation with the same hemo￾dynamic and echocardiographic benefits as with the original 
BCAT.
