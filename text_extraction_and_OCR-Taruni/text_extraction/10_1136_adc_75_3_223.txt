Byler-like familial cholestasis in an extended
kindred
B Bourke, N Goggin, D Walsh, S Kennedy, K D R Setchell, B Drumm
Abstract
Progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis (PFIC) occurs in many com￾munities and races. A form ofPFIC in five
children from two consanguineous mar￾riages in an Irish kindred is described. In
addition, a review of clinical information
from the records of three deceased mem￾bers of the kindred strongly implies that
they also suffered from PFIC. The chil￾dren had a history of neonatal diarrhoea,
sepsis, and intermittent jaundice that
ultimately became permanent. They suf￾fered intractable pruritus and growth
retardation. Despite evidence of severe
cholestasis, serum y-glutamyl transferase
and cholesterol were normal in these chil￾dren. Sweat sodium concentration were
raised in three children. Liver histology
showed severe intrahepatic cholestasis
and hepatocellular injury. Urinary bile
acid analysis revealed a non-specific pat￾tern consistent with chronic cholestasis.
These children suffer from a form ofPFIC
remarkably similar to that occurring in
members of the Byler kindred.

In 1969 Clayton et al described seven members
of an Amish family descended from Jacob
Byler with progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis (PFIC).' Although there have been
reports of a similar disease occurring in various
individuals and, races2-101 1-2 many of these
patients differed clinically from the Byler
children. Therefore, it is recognised that PFIC
comprises a heterogenous group of condi￾tions." We describe eight affected children
from a single kindred with a form of familial
intrahepatic cholestasis very similar to that of
the original Byler family. This kindred is part
of a group of highly intermarried (fig 1) Irish
travellers (an indigenous Irish nomadic com￾munity). Familial cholestasis affecting eight
related children offered a unique opportunity
for a detailed clinical and pathological study of
the natural history of this rare disease.
Patients
Clinical and biochemical profiles for the five
members of the kindred reviewed in this hospi￾tal were obtained from other hospital records
and appear in tables 1 and 2. Before cholestasis
became clinically apparent these children
suffered from episodes of sepsis and severe,
protracted diarrhoea. These features continued
after cholestasis was established and caused
significant morbidity throughout early child￾hood years.
In three of the children, episodic jaundice
appeared within the first two months of life.
However, the onset of jaundice was delayed
until 6 and 9 months respectively in the other
two children.
For each of the children, the established
illness was dominated by the complications of
chronic cholestasis. Severe, intractable pruritus
that was unresponsive to trials of phenobarbi￾tone,rifampicin,ursodeoxycholic acid,orphoto￾therapy was a particularly distressing symp￾tom. Marked hepatosplenomegaly was present
in all children. The liver was palpable between
4 and 10 cm below the right costal margin and
spleens were palpable up to 4 cm below the left
costal margin. In all cases the liver was of very
firm consistency. Short stature and failure to
thrive were also prominent (table 1).
Recurrent epistaxis was common to all five
children. However, haematemesis occurred in
only one child. Intellectual development was
normal in all of these children.
A number of additional features were also
present. Each of the five living children had
fine hypopigmented hair. These children also
manifested a spectrum of dystrophic nail
changes. Mild fingernail pitting, which was
evident in the younger children, was super￾ceded by gross dystrophic changes in the older
two. Nail scrapings taken from the eldest child
grew Candida inconspicua.
Results
Varying degrees of conjugated hyperbilirubi￾naemia and liver enzyme elevation were
present (table 2). However, in all of the
children, serum albumin and prothrombin
time were normal, suggesting hepatic synthetic
function was relatively preserved. During
intercurrent illness liver enzyme values in￾creased markedly. y-Glutamyl transferase and
cholesterol were normal or near normal in all
five children studied. All of the children had
markedly raised faecal fat content and severe
fat soluble vitamin deficiency.
Abnormal sweat tests were documented in
three of these children (table 2). Results of
sweat tests performed during infancy were
available for four living children (patients 1, 3,
4, and 5) and for two of the children now dead.
These sweat tests were all in the normal range
during infancy. In view of the abnormal sweat

manifestations of Alagille's syndrome, such as
posterior embryotoxin and butterfly vertebrae,
were sought but not found. Karyotype was
normal in all of the children.
Three other children from this kindred died
from sepsis. Two children were aged 4 months
and one was 15 months. Clinical information
was available for two of these children. The 15
month old child was diagnosed in another hos￾pital with PFIC. She had recurrent diarrhoea
and failure to thrive before the onset of
jaundice and pruritus at age 7 months. Her
disease was clinically and biochemically identi￾cal to that of the five living children described
above. The 4 month old child suffered with
severe diarrhoea and failure to thrive from age
1 month. At the time of death (4 months) he
was anicteric but had markedly raised
transaminases (alanine aminotransferase = 468
U/1). No clinical notes were available for the
third child. However, he was jaundiced at the
time of death.
Each of the five living children were followed
up at this institution for three years since the
initial referral; they were maintained on fat
soluble vitamin replacements. The eldest child
required intermittent hospitalisations during
intercurrent infections, which were commonly
accompanied by bouts of watery diarrhoea.
Although copious, stool output diminished
appropriately during fasting. Invariably, patho￾genic organisms were absent from stools
during these episodes. Furthermore, immuno￾logical investigations performed on a subgroup
of these children including immunoglobulin
concentrations (patients 1 and 3) and T cell
subsets (patient 1) were normal. IgG1, IgG2,
and IgG4 subclasses were raised in the one
child (patient 3) in whom they were evaluated.
Despite the severity of cholestasis during this
period there was no clinical or biochemical evi￾dence of disease progression among any of the
children.

Byler-like familial cholestasis in an extended kindred
LIVER HISTOLOGY
Liver biopsy specimens were obtained from
each of these children. The specimens from the
youngest children (patients 3, 4, and 5) showed
moderate periportal inflammation and portal
expansion. In these specimens there was
apparently normal bile duct number and
calibre with neocholangiole formation at the
periphery of the portal tracts. Changes within
the lobular parenchyma included pseudoro￾sette or pseudoacinar formation with bile
thrombi and canalicular bile stasis (fig 2A). In
the specimens from the older children (patients
1 and 2), pseudoacinar change and cholangi￾olar bile stasis were equally prominent with
giant cell transformation in the children aged
11 and 12 years (fig 2B). Steatosis was not
seen. Thin fibrous bands extended out from
the portal tracts in these specimens, although
bridging fibrosis and regenerative nodules were
not present (fig 2C). In specimens from these
older children there were inflammatory aggre￾gates within the hepatic parenchyma and occa￾sional acidophil bodies. Hepatocellular archi￾tectural changes such as irregular liver cell
plates were seen at this stage. An acquired pau￾city of intralobular bile ducts was also present
in these specimens.
URINARY BILE ACID ANALYSIS
Urinary bile acids were analysed for four of the
children (patients 1, 2, 3, and 4). Bile acids
were extracted, concentrated, and analysed by
fast atom bombardment ionisation-mass spec￾trometry (FAB-MS) and gas chromatography￾mass spectrometry (GC-MS).'s'6 The results
of FAB-MS and GC-MS analysis revealed
similar patterns for each of the four children.
All children were capable of synthesising the
two primary bile acids. Each had markedly
increased total urinary bile acid excretion.
Raised excretion of glycine, taurine, and
sulphate conjugates of dihydroxy, trihydroxy,
and tetrahydroxy cholanoic acids was detected.
The pattern of bile acid excretion was consist￾ent with chronic cholestasis rather than an
inborn error of bile acid synthesis.
Discussion
Since the report of Clayton et al in 1969,' the
terms PFIC and Byler disease have been used
synonymously for this condition. However, it is
clear that many cases described subsequently
demonstrate considerable clinical, biochemi￾cal, and pathological heterogeneity.2A 6 11
Therefore, it is now speculated that PFIC
includes a group of conditions of varying aeti￾ologies." In this report we have described a
form of PFIC affecting an extended kindred of
Irish travellers.
Members of this kindred suffered with a
form of PFIC identical in many respects to that
of the Byler kindred. Specific features common
to this Irish family and the original Byler
kindred include early onset of diarrhoea
followed by episodic cholestatic jaundice,
which ultimately becomes permanent, intrac￾table pruritus, growth, but not mental, retarda￾tion, fine blond hair, the complications of fat
soluble vitamin deficiency, normal serum
cholesterol, and recessive inheritance pat￾tern.' 17 It is also noteworthy that a high degree
of intermarriage is common among both the
Amish and Irish travelling people. However,
some features specific to the children in this
report (for example nail dystrophy) suggest
that this Irish family may suffer from a unique
form of PFIC.
Death in early life is a feature among some
children with this condition. 8 17 Three chil￾dren in this kindred are dead, two in infancy
and one at 15 months old. Of the five living
children, all spent the greater part of the first
year of life in hospital. True Byler disease and
Byler-like familial cholestasis associated with
low serum y-glutamyltransferase is associated
with a poor prognosis.' 1 However, it is
noteworthy that survival past infancy in this
Irish kindred has been followed by relatively
slow disease progression, albeit in the face of
severe cholestasis and a high level of morbidity.

Recurrent diarrhoea and sepsis were features
of this disease in the original Byler kindred.
A
recent report from Switzerland describes
a
similar case presenting with idiopathic diar￾rhoea and recurrent sepsis.8 Although we are
not told of any relationship between this case
and the Byler family, it is of interest that the
Byler kindred were of Swiss descent."7
Sweat electrolytes are reported to be raised
in some children with PFIC.'9 20 In this study,
raised or high normal sweat sodium values
were observed in all except one child (patient
5) over
6 months old. Frankly raised sweat
sodium was found in three children aged 4, 6,
and 12 years. Normal sweat test results were
documented elsewhere for five of these chil￾dren during infancy. This suggests that sweat
sodium is normal in early life when diagnostic
confusion with cystic fibrosis would be most
likely to occur. Conversely raised sweat sodium
or chloride may be
a useful marker for this
condition in later childhood. Despite some
phenotypic similarities these children do not
appear to have cystic fibrosis as they have no
evidence of respiratory disease and do not
manifest any of the more common cystic fibro￾sis mutations found in the Irish population. In
addition, the immune reactive trypsinogen
value was not depressed in one child (patient
3) in whom it was measured, consistent with
intact pancreatic ftunction.
Cell mediated immunity has been docu￾mented to be abnormal in patients with
PFIC," which may account for the recurrent
episodes of sepsis in these children. Although
dystrophic nail changes associated with
chronic candidiasis have not previously been
reported in PFIC, nail channel osteomyelitis
occurred in
a very similar case.8 Although we
failed to observe an abnormality in immuno￾globulin concentrations or T cell subsets in
members of this family, chronic nail infection
offers further evidence for
a defect in cell
mediated immunity in PFIC. The relevence of
the observed increase in IgG sublasses in one
of the kindred is as yet uncertain.
In this series the liver disease is characterised
at the histological level by
a combination of
intrahepatic cholestasis and hepatocellular in￾jury consistent with the toxic affect of accumu￾lated bile acids. Giant cell transformation was
not remarkable in the biopsy specimens of the
original Byler kindred.' '7 However, giant cell
transformation has been commented on in
other cases of PFIC," including
a case typical
of the original family in other respects.8
Pseudoacini or rosettes are
a prominent feature
of the disease in most reports. Paucity of bile
ducts has been
a prominent feature in some
reports of PFIC.' 22 Ductular proliferation
rather than paucity was present in the early
infancy biopsy specimens in the original report
of this condition.' However, ductular paucity
(with focal ductular proliferation) was present
in
a child aged 3.5 with the typical disease.8
There is considerable disagreement about
the typical pattern of bile acid excretion in
PFIC.'
2 517 However, there is no evidence to
implicate an inborn error of bile acid synthesis
as
a cause of this disease. We found no
evidence to suggest
a primary defect in bile
acid synthesis in this family. We were also
unable to detect
a raised cholic acid to cheno￾deoxycholic acid ratio in urine from this family
with PFIC as has been described for other
patients with PFIC.9
A recent report from
France implicates
a defect in canalicular secre￾tion of bile acids in the aetiology of PFIC."
This assumption was based on the finding of
very low concentration of biliary bile acids in
the presence of raised serum bile acids coupled
with normal serum y-glutamyltransferase in
seven unrelated children with PFIC. Further
studies comparing the bile acid profiles of
urine, serum, and bile from patients of the
original Byler kindred and others displaying
a
similar disease (such as those described in this
report) will help confirm this finding. Such
studies would also help to more precisely
establish the relationship of Byler disease to
other forms of PFIC.
Although not phenotypically identical, this
extended non-Amish family suffers from
a
form of PFIC remarkably similar to that of the
Byler kindred. An understanding of these rare
diseases may provide insights into the aetio￾pathogenic events underlying more frequently
encountered cholestatic conditions such as that
associated with cystic fibrosis. Therefore,
further investigations are warranted to eluci￾date the aetiology of these conditions.

ing theme: bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among others,
are listed together as causes of wheezing but
would rarely be considered together as possi￾ble diagnoses.
In the text I would have welcomed more
emphasis on differential diagnosis and more
information about the relative incidence of
the conditions mentioned under each head￾ing. There are some excellent concise ac￾counts. These are particularly useful where
information in textbooks is lacking, for
example Munchausen disease by proxy, and
where an overview directs further reading, for
example headaches and convulsions. How￾ever, combining an attempt to say something
about every condition with a need for brevity
often results in simplistic accounts, for exam￾ple, 'Crohn's disease is a rare though impor￾tant cause of abdominal pain in childhood'.
This book, despite its limitations, usefully
supplements standard texts. Paediatricians
may be helped when encountering less com￾mon symptoms and signs and when there is a
need to consider the rarer causes of common
symptoms. I have found it helpful when con￾sidering the differential diagnosis of such
diverse symptoms and signs as livedo reticu￾laris, excessive sweating, and the rarer causes
of apnoea in infancy. The enthusiastic
student may also usefully refer to the book
when starting to face diagnostic dilemmas.

Paediatric Pathology. 3rd Ed. Edited by Sir
Colin Berry. (Pp 942; £195 hardback.)
Springer-Verlag, 1996. ISBN 3-540-
19936-5.
Professor Berry's Paediatric Pathology now
enters its third edition, only six years after its
second. Over the three editions the size has
increased significantly with a smaller text size
on more pages. As a paediatric book, it largely
avoids those diseases and conditions associ￾ated more with the process of birth or prema￾turity, although of course congenital malfor￾mation features large. While some overlap is
inevitable, it is a stablemate of, and largely
complementary to, Keeling's Fetal and Neo￾natal Pathology. The book is directed prima￾rily towards the general rather than the
specialist paediatric pathologist and, as there
is no direct competition in paediatric pathol￾ogy, should find a receptive audience.
As a paediatric pathologist, I have found
previous editions a little too thin to be of very
much practical help when faced with a prob￾lem. Exception are those chapters that
describe a very practical approach to a prob￾lem whether of description (cardiac) or of
specimen handling and diagnostic require￾ments (metabolic).
If described at all, conditions have been
covered too briefly with little discussion of
differential diagnosis. As I doubt a general
pathologist will need less information and
explanation to understand a problem than a
specialist, I suspect my experience is true for
the target readership.
But that is the past, what of the third
edition? There is no significant change to the
overall format. As before, chapters cover
organ and system pathology in a conventional
manner but also with chapters on sudden
unexpected infant death, embryonal tu￾mours, and theoretical aspects of congenital
malformation. There are some changes in
authorship and new chapters on the pathol￾ogy of AIDS and bone marrow pathology.
The text is well set out and the illustrations
generally of good quality.
However, the most significant alteration
since the first edition is a cumulative one. The
modification of chapter titles together with a
gradual expansion of some chapter lengths,
not necessarily extensive, has led to a text that
will be a better resource to general and
specialist pathologists needing an introduc￾tion to less familiar areas. It may be
premature to look forward to the fourth edi￾tion, but I hope this trend towards expansion
continues.

Gellis and Kagan's Current Pediatric
Therapy. 1 5th Ed. Edited by F Burg, J Ingel￾finger, E Wald, and R Colin. (Pp 894; £55
hardback.) WB Saunders, 1996. ISBN 0-
7216-5016-3.
Over the years successive editions of Gellis
and Kagan's classic work, just like Topsy,
have 'growed and growed'. Thirty years on
and now in its 15th edition, this magnum
opus has four editors and 435 contributors. It
seemed a little incongruous (and more than a
little overwhelming) for a single reader to
comment on such a body of scholarship and,
in an attempt to redress the numerical imbal￾ance, I enlisted a handful of willing colleagues
to help me undertake the task! These
included a couple of general paediatricians,
one with an interest in rheumatology, a
paediatric oncologist, and a senior registrar.
We each chose relevant sections of the book
to read. I then collected comments, allowed
them to simmer for several weeks and finally
tried to prepare a distillate which was
representative of our views.
Firstly, the design characteristics of the
book were appreciated; printing was clear,
subheadings stood out, tables were easily
assimilated, and key references were ap￾pended after each author's contribution.
Inevitably the style of the text was a little
uneven with such a huge authorship but it
was easy to find one's way around the
volume. The book is truly comprehensive
with sections on fetal and adolescent medi￾cine, behavioural and social medicine, and
balanced consideration is given to emergency
management of acute disorders as well as
long term management of chronic condi￾tions. I failed to find guidance on one topic
only-pain relief in the dying child.
The consensus view is that Gellis and
Kagan is a good reference book for providing
the historic perspective on treatment as well
as current concepts, although precise practi￾cal advice on challenging problems is some￾times lacking.
It should be noted that despite our reserva￾tions, my willing helpers have extracted a
promise that the copy of this book that we are
allowed to keep as a reward for our labours is
generally available !

smaller affected sibship, from the second consanguineous grandparental marriage was
inadvertently omitted from figure 1. The correct depiction of the figure is shown below.
