Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy revisited:
recent insights into pathophysiology and
clinical spectrum
Andreas Charidimou, Qiang Gang, David J Werring
ABSTRACT
Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common
age related cerebral small vessel disease, characterised by
progressive deposition of amyloid-b (Ab) in the wall of
small to medium sized arteries, arterioles and capillaries of
the cerebral cortex and overlying leptomeninges. Previously
considered to be a rare neurological curiosity, CAA is now
recognised as an important cause of spontaneous
intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the
elderly, two fundamental challenges in the field of
cerebrovascular disease. Our understanding of the
pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of CAA
continues to evolve rapidly, with the use of transgenic
mouse models and advanced structural and/or molecular
neuroimaging techniques. Yet, despite remarkable recent
interest, CAA remains under-recognised by neurologists
and stroke physicians. In this review, a fresh look at key
developments in understanding the complex
pathophysiology, important clinical and radiological features,
diagnostic approaches and prospects for rational therapies
for this enigmatic small vessel disorder is provided.
INTRODUCTION
Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is
a common small vessel disease of the brain, char￾acterised by the progressive deposition of amyloid￾b (Ab) protein in the walls of small to medium
sized arteries (up to about 2 mm in diameter1
),
arterioles and capillaries in the cerebral cortex and
overlying leptomeninges.2 3 CAA can also affect
cerebellar vessels but only rarely those in the
brainstem or basal ganglia. Although known to
pathologists for over a century,4 5 CAA was not
linked to clinical disease until as late as the 1960s
when it was suggested to be a rare cause of intra￾cerebral haemorrhage (ICH).6e8 In recent years,
CAA has been ‘rediscovered’ as a common and
important cause of spontaneous ICH, which
remains the most devastating form of stroke, with
a death rate approaching 50% in contrast with
improved outcomes from ischaemic stroke.9 10 An
increased understanding of CAA thus holds promise
for improved prevention and treatment of ICH.
The growing interest in CAA is at least partly
thanks to two fields of research, which have been
important in defining the expanding clinicale
radiological phenotype and the underlying patho￾physiology of the disease: (1) neuroimaging, which
now allows an unprecedented ability to investigate
CAA dynamics in vivo using MRI to reveal complex
patterns of cerebral bleeding (including lobar
microbleeds11) and ischaemia, and an increasing
repertoire of specific amyloid binding ligands3 12e16;
and (2) transgenic mouse studies, which have
allowed the experimental alteration of amyloid
peptide expression and molecular structure,
providing significant mechanistic insights. Despite
these advances, CAA remains under-recognised by
neurologists and stroke physicians, making a fresh
look especially timely. In this review (see box 1 for
search strategy), we provide a comprehensive
update, emphasising the widening spectrum of
CAA clinical presentations and neuroimaging
features, including diagnostic approaches to reliably
identify the disease in vivo. Finally, we discuss
improved prospects for rational preventive or
disease modifying therapies for this common and
devastating microangiopathic disorder.
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Pathologically defined CAA is common in the
elderly.17e20 Population based autopsy studies
indicate a CAA prevalence of 20e40% in non￾demented and 50e60% in demented elderly
populations (figure 1).19 21e24 Furthermore, CAA
pathology may be severe in older individuals
(figure 1): in the HonolulueAsia Ageing Autopsy
Study, severe CAA was found in 43% of demented
and 24% of non-demented elderly individuals
(mean age at death 85 years).23 In Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), CAA is almost invariable being found
at autopsy in more than 90% of cases.17 25
However, most of these patients have mild CAA;
severe CAA is found in about 25% of AD brains.26
Advancing age is the strongest known clinical risk
factor for developing CAA.2 In a community based
sample of 100 individuals, the prevalence of cortical
vascular Ab deposition progressively increased from
the seventh to the ninth decades,27 a pattern also
observed in 784 consecutive autopsies, corrected for
over-representation of AD.28 Moreover, patients
with CAA related ICH (suggesting advanced
disease) in large autopsy series were all older than
60 years (and most over 70 years of age).7 29 30
Sporadic CAA is seldom reported before the sixth
decade of life; occasional patients presenting in their
50s have been described.31
In contrast with hypertensive arteriopathydthe
other main form of small vessel disease and cause of
ICH32dthe risk of CAA is not accounted for by
conventional cardiovascular risk factors other than
age.2 Hypertension is not considered a risk factor

ICH. Vinters2
din a clinicopathological series of 107 pathologi￾cally proven CAA casesdfound the prevalence of hypertension
to be around 32%, similar to community dwelling elderly
populations,33 while another pathological study reported that
CAA patients with ICH were more frequently hypertensive
(50%) than those without ICH (23%), suggesting that hyper￾tension may contribute to CAA related cerebral bleeding.34 In
a recent multicentre cohort of patients with spontaneous ICH,
we found that the prevalence of hypertension in CAA related
ICH was 62%dsignificantly less than in non-CAA related ICH
(85%).35 Whether hypertension in association with CAA confers
a greater risk for ICH compared with CAA alone is an important
clinical question.36e38 Evidence from the PROGRESS trial of
blood pressure lowering after stroke showed that a mean blood
pressure reduction of 9/4 mm Hg reduced the risk of future
CAA related ICH by about 77%, supporting an important causal
role for hypertension.38
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles are the only known genetic
risk factors for sporadic CAA.39 ApoE is a protein with crucial
roles in lipoprotein complexes, which regulate lipid metabolism
by binding to cell surface receptors and proteins associated with
lipid transfer and lipolysis.39 There are three major poly￾morphisms in the ApoE genednamely, 34, 32 and 33dresulting
in a single amino acid change40 which dramatically alters the
functional properties of ApoE isoforms.41 These alleles have
a strong dose dependent effect on the risk of developing CAA
and its clinical severity. Thus ApoE 34 in both postmortem and
clinical series increases the risk of sporadic CAA related lobar
ICH; moreover, the number of 34 alleles relates to clinical
severity.39 42e44 Individuals carrying the ApoE 32 allele also have
an increased risk of CAA related lobar ICH.44 45 Both of these
risk alleles are also associated with a younger age of first ICH,46
greater likelihood of haematoma expansion, poorer clinical
outcome47 48 and a higher risk of recurrence.49 Furthermore, the
two allelic variants interact: patients with both ApoE 32 and 34
alleles have the earliest disease onset and highest risk of
early ICH recurrence.49 50 The 32 and 34 alleles might promote
CAA related haemorrhage through distinct mechanisms: 34
by promoting Ab deposition and 32 by inducing structural
changes in amyloid laden vessels, making them prone to
rupture.47 48 50e52 Other as yet unidentified genetic poly￾morphisms relating to amyloid metabolic pathways (figure 2A)
may also play a role in sporadic CAA, (eg, presenilin-1, neprilysin
and transforming growth factor b-1),57e59 and are a topic of
ongoing investigation.
NEUROPATHOLOGY
Morphological characteristics, natural history and severity
grading
CAA primarily involves neocortical and leptomeningeal arteri￾oles, to a lesser extent capillaries and, very rarely, venules.3 In
contrast with amyloid plaques found in ADdwhich are
predominantly composed of the 42 amino acid residue fragment
(Ab42)dthe vascular amyloid in CAA is mostly composed of the
more soluble, 40 amino acid fragment (Ab40), suggesting
different pathophysiological mechanisms for pathological
deposition (see below).60e63 Cerebral vessels with moderate to
severe CAA show an acellular wall thickening with a strongly
eosinophilic smudgy appearance on haematoxylineeosin stained
sections.64 Congo red staining, under polarised light, reveals
amyloid deposits as ‘apple green’ birefringence (hence the term
congophilic angiopathy)2 65 although immunological stains for
Ab are highly specific and now widely used (figure 3). The
development of CAA is progressive, with Ab first appearing in
the abluminal aspect of the tunica media, surrounding smooth
muscle cells, and in the adventitia (figure 3).2 At the initial stage,
the vessel wall structure is intact, but as the disease progresses,
there is pan-mural amyloid accumulation and loss of smooth
muscle cells.3 In severe CAA, detachment and delamination of
the outer part of the tunica media result in the so-called ‘double
barrel’ appearance (figure 3)3
; fibrinoid necrosis and micro￾aneurysm formation also occur in advanced disease. There may
also be microbleeding with perivascular deposition of erythro￾cytes and blood breakdown products.64 Endothelial cells are
usually preserved even in vessels severely affected by CAA.66
Occasionally Ab is deposited in the surrounding brain paren￾chyma immediately adjacent to an affected vessel (sometimes
called ‘dyshoric CAA’).
CAA is also associated with cerebral ischaemic damage,17 26 67 68
including cortical microinfarcts,69 and white matter pathology
(demyelination and gliosis).8 17 62 Microinfarcts are predominantly
lobar (corticalesubcortical), usually in patients with severe CAA.
One possible mechanism for these ischaemic lesions is occlusion or
reduced perfusion in amyloid laden cortical vessels affected by CAA.
The changes described above provide the basis of neuropath￾ological scoring systems for CAA,34 67 70 each with strengths and
limitations.71 No standardised consensus neuropathological
criteria for rating CAA are available72 but are desirable to allow

comparison of CAA pathological studies between centres.
A more detailed discussion of CAA severity grading can be found
in a recent review by Attems and colleagues.3
Pathological subtypes of sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy
At least two distinct pathological subtypes of CAA have been
described: CAA type 1, characterised by Ab in cortical capillaries
(with or without involvement of other vessels)3
; and CAA type 2,
where Ab deposits are restricted to leptomeningeal and cortical
arteries, arterioles and, rarely, veins.73 Ab deposition in the wall of
capillaries (capillary CAA) may cause luminal obstruction in the
most severe stages.1 The Apo E 34 allele is most strongly asso￾ciated with CAA type 1 while Apo E 32 is more associated with
CAA type 2.73 CAA type 1 appears to be more closely associated
with parenchymal amyloid deposition in AD.74
Topographical distribution
Sporadic CAA favours posterior cortical regions; the occipital
lobe is most frequently affected, followed by the frontal,
temporal and parietal lobes.2 3 The occipital lobe is also most
severely affected.75 76 The cerebellum can be affected in
advanced stages while the basal ganglia, thalami, white
matter and brainstem are typically spared.71 The distribution of
CAA pathology shows a characteristic patchy pattern,2 so that
foci of vessels severely affected by CAA may be adjacent to
other with mild or absent Ab deposition.2 3 The practical

production, elimination and deposition
in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
Converging evidence indicates that the
major source of Ab is neuronal. It is
generated by sequential cleavage
of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
b- and g-secretases, in proportion to
neuronal activity. Ab is eliminated from
the brain by four major pathways: (a)
proteolytic degradation by
endopeptidases (such as neprilysin and
insulin degrading enzyme (IDE)); (b)
receptor mediated clearance by cells in
the brain parenchyma (microglia,
astrocytes and to a lesser extent
neurones); (c) active transport into the
blood through the bloodebrain barrier
(BBB); (d) elimination along the
perivascular pathways by which
interstitial fluid drains from the brain.53 54
Specialised carriers (eg, ApoE) and/or
receptor transport mechanisms (eg, the
low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
and LDLR related protein (LRP1)) are
involved in all major cellular clearance
pathways. Vascular deposition is
facilitated by factors that increase the
Ab40:Ab42 ratio (while increased Ab42
leads to oligomerisation and amyloid
plaques) and impede perivascular
passage. As the clearance mechanisms
fail with age, Ab is increasingly
entrapped from the perivascular drainage
pathways into the basement membranes
of capillaries and arterioles of the brain
leading to CAA.55 56 ApoE alleles have
a differential effect on different molecular
and cellular processes of Ab production,
elimination and deposition in a way that
they either increase or decrease the risk
of developing CAA. (B) The roles of
different ApoE alleles in various

consequence of this is that cerebral biopsy may miss patchy
CAA pathology.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS
Amyloid-b production, clearance and accumulation
Ab is generated by sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor
protein (APP) by b- and g-secretases. Mutations in the gene
encoding the APP account for some rare (usually autosomal
dominant) forms of CAA, including CAA Dutch type.77 Familial
non-Ab forms of CAA include familial British dementia,78 79
familial Danish dementia80 and Icelandic cystatin C mutation.81
In general, hereditary forms of CAA have an earlier onset and
more severe clinical manifestations than sporadic CAA.64 82
Although exceptionally rare, familial CAAs have provided
significant insights on how mutations in the coding region of
the APP contribute to CAA pathogenesis: for example, the Iowa,
Dutch, Italian and Arctic mutations render Ab highly toxic to
vessel wall components83e85 and more resistant to proteolytic
degradation86 or clearance from the brain (figure 2).55
Factors that initiate or promote Ab peptide deposition in the
much more common sporadic CAA are not as well understood.
Nevertheless, transgenic mouse models of cerebral amyloid
deposition3 have provided the following insights (figure 2): (1)
the major source of human Ab is neuronal87 88; (2) an increased
ratio of Ab40:Ab42 in the brain results in a shift from brain
parenchyma to the vasculature (perhaps by increasing the
solubility of Ab and thus its diffusion into the vessel wall)53; and
(3) vascular Ab deposition largely results from impaired clear￾ance of Ab (rather than overproduction), especially along
perivascular drainage pathways.3 54 89 Impairment of peri￾vascular drainage pathways has emerged as a key mechanism in
sporadic CAA3 56 90: these efflux channels may be conceptualised
as a cerebral ‘lymphatic system’, allowing interstitial fluid and
solutes to drain out of the brain along basement membranes in
the capillary walls, and between smooth muscle cells in the
tunica media of small arteries (in the opposite direction to
arterial blood flow) (figure 2).91 This transport system is thought
to be driven by pulsations of the blood vessel wall.91 92 As this
and other clearance mechanisms fail in the ageing brain, or under
other pathological conditions, Ab is increasingly trapped
and deposited in the walls of small arteries (figure 2).91 Evidence
is emerging that cerebrovascular disease may impede the
drainage along the perivascular pathways, contributing to CAA
pathogenesis.90 93
It has been suggested that Ab deposition could further impair/
block the perivascular drainage, leading to dilation of peri￾vascular spaces (also known as VirchoweRobin spaces), not
only within lobar regions but also in the underlying white
matter that itself is unaffected by CAA.94 95 These enlarged
perivascular spaces can reach several millimetres in diameter and
may be visible on appropriate brain imaging; this requires
further investigation as a potential useful neuroimaging marker
of CAA.95 96
As we have seen, ApoE is a strong genetic risk factor for CAA,
an effect mediated by its important role in Ab metabolism,
aggregation and clearance (figure 2B).39 54 89 ApoE 34 increases
the Ab40:Ab42 ratio, shifting amyloid deposition to the vessels
instead of brain parenchyma,53 and may reduce the efficiency of
efflux of Ab along perivascular channels,3 97 influencing CAA risk
and age of onset.39 98 ApoE genotype may also interact with

other small vessel disease changes: hypertensive arteriopathy,
which leads to stiffening of the vessel wall, may reduce the
pulsatile driving movements required for efficient perivascular
drainage and thus contribute to the risk of CAA.3
From amyloid-b deposition to cerebral amyloid angiopathy
pathogenesis
Ab deposition has complex effects on vascular structure and
function which can result in brain injury.32 99 Important
morphological changes include: loss of smooth muscle cells100;
vessel wall thickening and lumen restriction67; endothelial
dysfunction; and a loss of compliance leading to brittle, fragile
vessels prone to microaneurysm formation and leakage.3
Acute trigger factorsdfor example, sudden increases in blood
pressuredor minor trauma (regularly encountered in clinical
practice but not to our knowledge formally studied) may cause
the rupture of these abnormally weak, amyloid laden vessels. Ab
deposition may also impair local regulation of cerebral blood
flow,99 neurovascular unit function101 and general homeostatic
mechanisms in the ageing brain.35 Other effects of vascular Ab,
including bloodebrain barrier disruption and active inflamma￾tion, could also contribute.3 99 Moreover, even without vascular
deposition, soluble Ab can cause abnormal vascular reactivity99
and induce the activation of inflammatory mediators, including
matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2.3 102 103
THE EXPANDING CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF SPORADIC
CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY
There are at least four important clinical presentations associ￾ated with CAA:
< Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage
< Cognitive impairment and dementia
< Rapidly progressive cognitive and neurological decline
< Transient neurological symptoms
Intracerebral haemorrhage
Association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and intracerebral
haemorrhage
CAA is most often recognised in life by symptomatic, sponta￾neous, lobar ICH in elderly patients. The majority of ICHs
(>75%) in the elderly are classified as spontaneous (sometimes
also termed primary or non-traumatic), resulting from rupture
of small arteries affected by two main processes: hypertensive
arteriopathy or CAA. Hypertensive arteriopathydcharacterised
by lipohyalinosis and fibrinoid necrosis of small lenticulostriate
arterial perforatorsdis considered an important cause of spon￾taneous ICH in deep or infratentorial locations (basal ganglia,
thalamus and pons). By contrast, CAA related ICHs preferen￾tially affect corticalesubcortical (lobar) regions (especially the
occipital and temporal lobes104), less commonly the cerebellum
and rarely deep or brainstem structures, reflecting the distribu￾tion of the underlying microangiopathy.2 30 75 The predilection
for the occipital lobes is not well understood but one hypothesis
is that greater tortuosity of occipital small arteries impairs
perivascular drainage.3
Clinicopathological studies suggest that CAA related ICH
accounts for at least 5e20% of all spontaneous ICH,2 17 26 34 105 106
and that the link is strongest for lobar ICH. However, there are
methodological challenges in attributing ICH to CAA: most
pathological case control studies did not systematically control
for potential confounding risk factors for CAA, including
cognitive impairment, ethnicity or age. Furthermore, patholog￾ical studies showed differences in the prevalence of ICH only
when comparing the presence of low grade CAA versus moderate
to high grade CAA,23 26 34 67 107e110 suggesting that mild CAA
may not confer such a high risk of ICH. Since many elderly
individuals in population based studies have subclinical CAA
without haemorrhage, CAA (especially if mild) may not be
a sufficient cause of lobar ICH alone, but may interact with
other factorsdfor example, hypertension, neurodegenerative
pathology or the use of anticoagulant drugs.23 26 34 67 107e110
Clinical features of cerebral amyloid angiopathy related intracerebral
haemorrhage
CAA related ICHs have some distinct neuroimaging features,
which are shown in figure 4.75 111 However, the clinical
presentation of CAA related ICH is similar to other forms of
lobar ICH (eg, due to tumours or arteriovenous malformations)
and varies according to ICH size and location. Patients usually
present with an acute stroke syndrome with focal neurological
deficits that may be associated with headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizures and/or altered level of consciousness (especially large
lobar bleeds).10 There may also be a history of apparently minor
head trauma, which might predispose to ICH in individuals
with CAA. The typical lobar location of haemorrhage more
often leads to acute seizures than in deep ICH. A first ever ICH
due to CAA may be relatively mild clinically but this is coun￾terbalanced by the high risk of recurrent haemorrhages; indeed,
subsequent ICH (which characteristically may cluster over
a short period of time (days to weeks)) is often much more
severe.112 In the longer term, survivors of lobar ICH are at higher
risk of recurrence compared with deep ICH, with a rate of about
10% per year in elderly cohorts.2 112 Recurrent haemorrhages are
typically lobar, often in the same lobe as the initial CAA related
bleed.104 Multiple simultaneous lobar haemorrhages are charac￾teristic of CAA related ICH. Recovery from lobar ICH is
often poor: negative prognostic factors include older age46 and
larger haematoma size113; conversely, a small superficial ICH
without intraventricular extension is associated with better
outcome.
Anticoagulant related haemorrhage
CAA may be an important risk factor or cause for ICH related to
oral anticoagulation use. Over the past decade there has been
a fivefold increase in the incidence of anticoagulant related ICH,
which now accounts for about 15% of all ICH.114 This trend is
probably due to increasing use of warfarin to prevent cardi￾oembolic stroke in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation.
Anticoagulant use per se should not cause ICH if cerebral vessels
are intact but the presence of CAA, rendering vessels brittle and
fragile, is a plausible aggravating factor for such haemorrhage; an
otherwise innocuous minor and self-limiting vessel leak (eg,
a cerebral microbleed (CMB), see below) could form a life
threatening haematoma if the leaking vessel is damaged by
advanced CAA. Evidence supporting a link between CAA and
anticoagulation related ICH includes the following observations:
first, most such ICH occur with international normalised ratios
within the therapeutic range115 suggesting that an intrinsic
disorder of cerebral small vessels could be important; and second,
the ApoE e2 allele is more common in warfarin related ICH than
in patients on warfarin without ICH, supporting a role for
CAA.115 Although CAA may underlie a substantial proportion of
anticoagulation related haemorrhages, prospective studies with
reliable diagnosis of CAA in life (eg, by MRI evidence of lobar
CMBs or molecular imaging) in cohorts of patients treated with
anticoagulants are urgently needed to answer this question (one
large prospective MRI study is currently underway in the UK:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cromis-2).

CAA may also be a risk factor for ICH after thrombolysis:
spontaneous CAA related and thrombolysis related haemor￾rhages share some features, including a predilection of lobar
brain regions, multiplicity of haemorrhages, age dependency and
an association with dementia and leukoaraiosis.116 In one small
study, two of five cases of ICH after thrombolysis for acute
myocardial infarction had severe CAA identified.117
Cognitive impairment and dementia
There is now increasing evidence that CAA is an important
contributor to cognitive impairment72 118 although dissecting its
independent cognitive impact is confounded by the presence of
coexisting AD and other age related pathologies (eg, hyperten￾sive arteriopathy). Nevertheless, in population based clin￾icalepathological studies, the prevalence of CAA is consistently
higher in demented compared with non-demented patients
(figure 1).19 In the population based Medical Research Councile
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study, CAA was significantly
associated with dementia (OR 9.3, 95% CI 2.7 to 41.0), even
after controlling for age and dementia related neuropathologies
(eg, neuritic and diffuse plaques).22 Similarly, the Honolulue
Asia Ageing Autopsy Study revealed a significantly higher
prevalence of severe CAA in demented versus non-demented
patients (43% vs 24%) (figure 1).23 CAA may worsen the severity
of cognitive dysfunction in AD: CAA together with AD
pathology has been associated with significantly worse cognitive
performance during life, compared with AD alone, even after
controlling for age, neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques
number, infarctions and ApoE genotype.23 There are few studies
of the specific pattern of cognitive impairment associated with
CAA; a recent autopsy series found that moderate to severe CAA
(present in 19% of the study population) was associated with
lower performance in specific cognitive domains, notably
perceptual speed and episodic memory, after accounting for AD
pathology and other potential covariates.119 The pathophysio￾logical mechanisms by which CAA could cause cognitive
impairment have not been well established118 but relevant
lesions on brain imaging could include cerebral microbleed,120
microinfarcts35 121 and white matter changes.122
CAA is thus emerging as a potentially important link between
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathology.123 Vascular
cognitive impairment and AD are now conceptualised as
a continuum118 124 125 with complex interactions and shared risk
factors.99 123 CAA seems likely to exacerbate the deleterious
effect of neurodegenerative pathology on the brain, lowering the
threshold for overt dementia.99 118 Unravelling the independent
contribution of CAA to cognitive function is particularly
important as it could lead to new therapeutic strategies.

Rapidly progressive cognitive and neurological decline: cerebral
amyloid angiopathy related inflammation
CAA is clearly a direct cause of cognitive impairment in the
uncommon but clinically striking presentation of CAA related
inflammation (also termed cerebral amyloid angiitis, amyloid
b related angiitis and cerebral amyloid inflammatory vasculop￾athy).126 CAA related inflammation typically affects older
adults, who present with acute to subacute cognitive decline,
headache, behavioural change, seizures and focal neurological
deficits.126 Typical MRI findings include patchy or confluent,
asymmetric T2 weighted or FLAIR white matter hyper￾intensities (with or without mass effect and leptomeningeal or
parenchymal enhancement).126 T2* weighted gradient recalled
echo (T2*-GRE) or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) may
reveal previous lobar haemorrhage and/or multiple cortical and
subcortical microbleeds.126 The major differential diagnoses
include infections (in particular progressive multifocal leucoen￾cephalopathy), neurosarcoidosis, immune related conditions (eg,
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)127 and malignancies.126
Definite diagnosis requires brain and leptomeningeal biopsy
showing perivascular inflammation with mononuclear or
multinucleated giant cells associated with Ab laden vessels
and/or frank vasculitis.126 Although the clinical course of
CAA related inflammation is varied, it is important to recognise
because it may respond well to immunosuppressive treatment
(eg, high dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide).126 128
This distinct syndrome has parallels with that observed in
patients with AD who developed meningoencephalitis after
immunisation against human Ab, where postmortem examina￾tion revealed inflammation and/or vasculitis associated with
CAA.129 130
Transient focal neurological episodes
After ICH, the next most commonly described clinical presen￾tation of sporadic CAA is with transient neurological
episodes,131e133 sometimes termed ‘amyloid spells’. The most
common type of attack involves recurrent, stereotyped episodes
of ‘positive’ spreading sensory symptoms (paraesthesias).131 132
Although there are a number of small case reports and
series,131 132 134 135 no large systematic studies have investigated
the prevalence or semiology of these phenomena. At least two
other types of transient events have been described: partial
motor seizure-like episodes (eg, limb shaking); and visual
disturbances (usually positive visual symptoms similar to
migrainous auras). Spells are typically brief, almost always less
than about 30 min, and usually less than a few minutes. The
attacks seem likely to be related to haemorrhagic components of
CAA: associated neuroimaging findings reported include CMBs
and convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH) in the cortical
region corresponding to the spell (figure 4E).131 135 The diagnosis
of these CAA related attacks is of clinical relevance as they seem
to precede serious symptomatic ICH in some patients; anti￾platelet or anticoagulant use following such an attack misdiag￾nosed as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) could therefore cause
potentially avoidable intracranial bleeding. The underlying
mechanisms of CAA transient spells remain unclear but could
include seizure-like activity (perhaps related to small areas of
bleedingdfor example, microbleeding, cSAH or superficial side￾rosis); a direct effect of amyloid or bleeding on local cortical
function; or spreading cortical depression.131 The responsiveness
of these attacks to antiepileptic drugs as well as their spreading
nature in many of the reported cases is in favour of a seizure-like
mechanism for their pathophysiology. In a case series by Roth
and colleagues,132 four out of six patients with these transient
attacks responded to anticonvulsants while the other two
patients showed improvement after cessation of antiplatelet
therapy. Typical TIA-like episodes have also been reported in
CAA133 but whether these are genuinely due to ischaemia and
should be treated with antithrombotic agents requires further
study.
NEUROIMAGING (MRI) CORRELATES OF CEREBRAL AMYLOID
ANGIOPATHY
The important MRI correlates of CAA (figures 4 and 5) include:
< Cerebral microbleeds
< White matter changes (leukoaraiosis)
< Convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage
< Cortical superficial siderosis
< Silent acute ischaemic lesions
Cerebral microbleeds
The widespread use of T2* weighted MRI sequences in the past
decade or so has led to the increasing detection of CMBs: small,
well demarcated, hypointense, rounded lesions, not detected on
conventional MRI (figure 4DeG).136 Histopathological studies
show that CMBs correspond to focal accumulations of haemo￾siderin laded macrophages (a blood breakdown product) adja￾cent to abnormal small vessels affected by hypertensive
angiopathy or CAA.137 138 There is increasing evidence that
hypertensive vasculopathy is associated with CMBs in deep
brain regions (basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem) whereas
CAA is characterised by CMBs in a lobar distribution136 138 with
a predilection for the parietal lobes.104 The Rotterdam scan
study139 140 showed a strong association between strictly lobar
(but not deep) CMBs and ApoE 34, consistent with the well
known relation of this allele with CAA.49 A recent imaging
study in clinically probable CAA, using non-invasive amyloid
imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), found that CMBs
correspond to areas with a high concentration of amyloid.141
Moreover, CMBs correlate with the risk of lobar ICH recur￾rence,142 suggesting an important role in prognosis (as well as
diagnosis) in CAA.11

Recent population based studies have revealed a high
percentage of community dwelling elderly people with strictly
lobar microbleeds (particularly in the posterior brain regions),
suggesting subclinical CAA.139 140 143 144 This may have
important implications: if strictly lobar CMBs are validated as
a diagnostic marker of CAA, such asymptomatic individuals
could benefit from new therapeutic agents to reduce the
progression of the disease.
Neuroimaging studies have revealed lobar CMBs in more than
20% of patients with AD,145 probably reflecting advanced CAA
(in keeping with neuropathological findings). Patients with
autosomal dominant forms of familial AD (who have a younger
age at symptom onset), also seem to have a prevalence of lobar
CMBs similar to sporadic AD146da striking recent observation
since these patients are much more likely to have ‘pure’ neuro￾degenerative AD without coexisting sporadic small vessel
disease. It has been suggested that the presence of multiple lobar
CMBs in patients with AD may identify a specific subgroup of
patients with a different clinical phenotype with therapeutic
implications which need to be explored in future studies.145
Leukoaraiosis
Leukoaraiosis is a radiological term which describes imaging
changes (often confluent) in deep cerebral white matter.
Leukoaraiosis appears as low attenuation on CT scans or hyper￾intensity on T2 weighted or FLAIR MRI, typically sparing
subcortical U fibres (figure 4C).147 Pathological substrates include
demyelination, axon loss and mild gliosis. The pathogenesis of
leukoaraiosis in CAA probably involves chronic hypoperfusion of
the vulnerable periventricular white matter and disruption of the
bloodebrain barrier due to amyloid in the overlying cortical small
vessels.32 95 148 Another possible mechanism of leukoaraiosis in
CAA is as a result of the accumulation of silent ischaemic lesions
(microinfarcts).12 35 149 Indeed, leukoaraiosis is very common in
CAA, preferentially involving posterior regions,150 although some
studies suggest no major difference in the topography of
leukoaraiosis in CAA compared with hypertensive arterio￾pathy.122 150 A recent investigation suggested that subjects with
CAA related lobar ICH have a higher prevalence of occipital
dominant leukoaraiosis compared with normal elderly
controls151; this interesting finding requires further clinical
attention and investigation. Leukoaraiosis may be an important
contributor to overall disease burden, especially progressive
cognitive impairment,152 given its tendency to accumulate over
time.153 A recent study found that leukoaraiosis volume was
greater in patients with CAA and hypertension than those
without, suggesting that strict control of hypertension might
reduce leukoaraiosis related disability in CAA.152
Convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage and cortical superficial
siderosis
Atraumatic cSAH and superficial siderosis are recently recog￾nised imaging correlates of sporadic CAA154 which seem to be
quite characteristic of the disorder (figure 4E,F). cSAH is local￾ised bleeding, usually in up to several adjacent sulci, without
other subarachnoid bleeding at the base of the brain in the
pattern typically associated with saccular aneurysm rupture.155
Although rare in isolation, in CAA, cSAH often results from
lobar ICH extending to the cortical surface.134 154 156 The largest
cohort of patients with isolated cSAH published (n¼29) found
that CAA was a frequent apparent cause in patients over
60 years old.155 157 A recent retrospective analysis of consecutive
patients admitted to a tertiary stroke unit with cSAH suggested
that CAA could be a common cause in the elderly, with
a characteristic clinical presentation of single or recurrent tran￾sient focal neurological attacks.135 Another recent study of
a cohort of patients presenting with cSAH reported similar
findings.158
Cortical superficial siderosis describes haemosiderin deposition
in the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex (figure 5), and may
follow repeated episodes of bleeding in the subarachnoid
space.154 On T2*-GRE MRI sequences, cortical superficial side￾rosis shows a characteristic ‘gyriform’ pattern of hypointense
signal (figure 5E,F).154 Linn et al have recently detected cortical
superficial siderosis in 47.4% (n¼38) of patients with a clinical
diagnosis of CAA compared with no controls (mean age
54 years), suggesting that it might be helpful for the clinical
diagnosis of CAA (see below).159 Compared with the well
known syndrome of CNS superficial siderosis, which typically
affects the brainstem and posterior fossa (associated with cere￾bellar and brainstem signs), CAA related siderosis has a predi￾lection for the cerebral convexity160 and may be associated with
transient neurological manifestations.132
Silent acute ischaemic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging
Neuropathological evidence of asymptomatic ischaemic infarc￾tion is an established finding in the brains of patients with
advanced CAA.8 67e69 Recent studies using magnetic resonance
diffusion weighted imagingdwhich is extremely sensitive to
even small areas of acute ischaemiadhave shed light on the
dynamics of this phenomenon in vivo (figure 4H). A case
report13 and a recent case control study12 found a high preva￾lence of diffusion weighted imaging positive lesions in patients
with advanced CAA. These lesions were associated with CMB
burden, suggesting shared pathophysiological pathways.161
Gregoire et al recently established that acute, subclinical
ischaemic brain lesions are frequent after recent acute ICH, and
are three times more common in CAA related ICH than other
spontaneous bleeds35; the lesions were associated with the
severity of leukoaraiosis and lobar CMBs, suggesting that they
were due to a CAA related occlusive arteriopathy.35 These data
suggest a dynamic interplay between the haemorrhagic
(‘microbleeding’) and ischaemic (‘microinfarction’) components
in CAA161 although the therapeutic implications and prognostic
significance of these findings require further study.
MOLECULAR IMAGING OF VASCULAR AMYLOID IN VIVO
MRI indirectly detects the consequences of CAA (eg, CMBs,
cSAH and siderosis) rather than vascular amyloid itself. Conse￾quently, a large proportion of ‘silent’ CAA may be as yet
undetectable. Positron emission tomography methods allow the
in vivo imaging of amyloid in the brain, using several radio￾ligands, of which the most widely studied is 11C PiB.162 Ly et al
demonstrated that CAA subjects had increased global PiB uptake
relative to a healthy elderly control group, and found an occipital
predominance of PiB retention in CAA compared with AD.16 PiB
positron emission tomography might therefore ultimately
detect CAA in vivo, even before it causes symptomatic ICH or
the known radiological sequelae, including CMBs.14 15 141 163
DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO CEREBRAL AMYLOID
ANGIOPATHY: THE CRITICAL ROLE OF NEUROIMAGING
A common clinical scenario where sporadic CAA should be
suspected is in elderly patients presenting with lobar ICH. The
most commonly used criteria for CAA diagnosis are the Boston
criteria (box 2).164 In the absence of direct neuropathological
examination, CAA is diagnosed based on characteristic

neuroimaging findings.164 The diagnosis of ‘probable CAA’
requires the following (box 2):
< Age $55 years
< Detection of multiple haemorrhagic cerebral lesions
< Haemorrhages confined to cortical or corticalesubcortical
(lobar) brain regions
< Exclusion of secondary causes of ICH, such as arteriovenous
malformations, head trauma, brain tumour, vasculitis and
excessive anticoagulation.
The specificity of the Boston criteria has been validated
against the established gold standard of neuropathological
diagnosis from autopsy, haematoma evacuation or cortical
biopsy.164 In this study, the criteria showed excellent specificity:
all cases identified as ‘probable CAA’ (n¼13) had pathological
evidence of severe CAA. However, the sensitivity of the probable
category was 44%, so that it failed to identify over 50% of those
with severe CAA pathology.164 However, this study does not
reflect current radiological practice as only 15 patients had T2*-
GRE imaging. Recently, the application of the Boston criteria
with a greater use of T2*-GRE MRI in Dutch-type hereditary
CAA found a much improved sensitivity (especially when lobar
CMBs were included in the criteria).165 The rationale for the
inclusion of lobar CMBs in the criteria is that both lobar CMBs
and lobar ICH represent independent vascular rupture events
which are considered to offer equal evidence for the presence
of CAA.166 The recently introduced SWI, a three-dimensional
T2*-GRE technique, enables visualisation of CMBs with much
increased sensitivity, resulting in higher lesion counts (at
least 67% more compared with conventional T2*-GRE)
(figure 4D),167e169 but its effect on diagnostic accuracy for CAA
requires further study. Superficial siderosis and cSAH, which
have a high prevalence in CAA related ICH but are rare in other
forms of ICH, have been shown to enhance the sensitivity of the
Boston criteria without loss of specificity.159
Although the value of T2* weighted MRI and SWI in
detecting CMBs, cSAH and siderosis has mainly been validated
in cohorts of patients who presented with symptomatic ICH,
such imaging may also have a role in the diagnosis of patients
presenting without major haemorrhage but with other
syndromes, raising suspicion of CAA; for example, elderly
patients with progressive cognitive impairment.118 135 168 170 171
In addition, although at present T2* MRI or SWI sequences are
not part of the routine investigation of TIA-like attacks, there
might be useful in patients with CAA related transient focal
neurological episodes (‘amyloid spells’)drather atypical of TIAs
(figure 4G).132 135 However, current data are insufficient to make
evidence based recommendations.
Other biomarkers might also prove useful in the non-invasive
diagnosis of CAA, in particular the assessment of Ab concen￾trations in CSF. Decreased levels of CSF Ab42 but not Ab40 are
found in AD172 while it has been reported that both Ab42 and
Ab40 concentrations are decreased in CAA, relative to control
and AD patients.173 It has also been suggested that the combi￾nation of low Ab42 with increased total s levels in CSF, can
discriminate CAA patients from normal controls with high
accuracy.173 Another potentially promising marker of CAA
might include retinal changes (microaneurysms and dot and blot
haemorrhages174). A critical goal of all of these potential
approaches is to reliably identify CAA at the early (asymptom￾atic) stages of the disease, to allow the best chance for disease
modifying or preventive treatments to be effective.
MANAGEMENT AND PROSPECTS FOR DISEASE MODIFICATION
Acute treatment
No treatment is specific for symptomatic management of CAA or
CAA related ICH. As in all forms of spontaneous ICH, CAA
related haematomas enlarge in the first few hours after onset,
providing a potential target for treatment. One of the most
promising available treatments in acute ICH is lowering blood
pressure, which has been shown to reduce haematoma expansion
in a randomised trial,175 presumably by reducing hydrostatic
pressure into the ICH in the critical hyperacute phase; a further
large study is underway.176 The role of neurosurgery in ICH
remains to be defined clearly and is a topic of ongoing investi￾gation.177 Although there have previously been concerns
regarding surgery in CAA due to the risk of bleeding from fragile
amyloid laden vessels, the available evidence does not suggest
a particularly high operative risk.178e180 Neurosurgery for
haematoma evacuation appears relatively safe in at least some
patients with CAA related ICH, particularly in patients less than
75 years of age without intraventricular extension.180 Until

further evidence of specific acute treatments is available, it is
reasonable to follow the American Heart Association Stroke
Council guidelines for acute management of ICH, without
modification for individuals with suspected CAA.181 Active
research into new approaches for acute ICH treatment is
expected to benefit patients with CAA related bleeds. Novel
approaches, including neuroprotective drugs182 183 which target
the multitude of processes that occur after ICH (eg, cerebral
oedema, thrombin release, red blood cell lysis and haemoglobin
induced neurotoxicity)184 and iron chelating agents (such as
deferoxamine)185 are all being studied in early phase trials.9 181 186
Prevention of recurrent ICH
Withholding anticoagulants and antiplatelets
It is a paradox that many elderly patients at highest risk of
occlusive vascular events are also at the highest risk of
haemorrhage complications, including ICH. Judging the balance
of risk and benefit of antithrombotic treatment after ICH in
those patients with an indication for vascular secondary
prevention is thus a major clinical challenge. The available
evidence on this topic is limited, consisting of generally small
case control and prospective observational studies. In a recent
prospective cohort of patients with spontaneous lobar ICH, an
association was found between aspirin use and ICH recurrence
after adjusting for other potential ICH risk factors (HR 3.95,
95% CI 1.6 to 8.3; p <0.021).187 Rebleeding risk was associated
with the number of lobar CMBs and the presence of leukoar￾aiosis in posterior brain regionsdpossible markers of underlying
CAA and its severity.187 Gregoire et al in a small case control
study found that lobar CMBs were associated with antiplatelet
related ICH, also supporting a link between CAA and anti￾platelet related ICH.188 Another small case control study of
warfarin related ICH and matched ICH-free warfarin users
showed an association of warfarin with CMBs, but with
large CIs around the ORs for the association.189 There are no
randomised trial data but a decision analysis suggested that in
patients with CAA related ICH, the use of anticoagulants to
prevent future cardioembolic (atrial fibrillation related) stroke
would lead to an ICH rate that outweighs any benefit from the
treatment.190
Whether multiple lobar CMBs (without symptomatic ICH)
confer an unacceptably high risk of future ICH with the use of
antithrombotic agents requires further study. In a recent meta￾analysis, Lovelock et al pooled the information of 1461 patients
with ICH and 3817 patients with ischaemic stroke or TIAs and
they showed that CMBs were more common in warfarin related
ICH than ‘spontaneous’ ICH. In pooled follow-up data for 768
patients treated with antithrombotics (anticoagulant or anti￾platelet drugs), the presence of CMB at baseline was associated
with a significantly increased risk of future ICH (OR 12.1; 95%
CI 3.4 to 42.5; p<0.001), but this study did not separately
investigate the effects of lobar versus deep CMBs.191
For the moment, anticoagulation should usually be avoided in
patients with a diagnosis of CAA and symptomatic lobar ICH,
unless there is a very compelling need to treat that could
outweigh the very high risk of recurrent ICH (eg, life threat￾ening pulmonary embolism or a mechanical heart valve).
Although antiplatelet drugs probably also increase future ICH
risk in CAA, it may be reasonable to consider them in selected
patients with CAA for secondary prevention in whom the risk of
intracerebral bleeding is judged to be low and the risk of occlu￾sive vascular events high, based on their clinical and imaging
characteristics. In primary prevention, the risk/benefit ratio may
favour withholding treatment in patients with multiple lobar
CMBs. Further randomised clinical trials are urgently needed to
help clarify the optimum antithrombotic treatment in these
different CAA patient groups.
Blood pressure control
A recent subgroup analysis of the PROGRESS trial reported that
lowering blood pressure with the antihypertensive drug peri￾ndopril (with or without indapamide) reduced the risk of
probable CAA related ICH by 77% (95% CI 19% to 93%) over
a follow-up period of 3.9 years.38 Despite a small total number
of CAA related ICH events, this is the first trial to show that
blood pressure lowering treatment protects against CAA
related ICH, regardless of the presence of hypertension.38 Blood
pressure lowering may also be associated with a more general
benefit in cardiovascular risk and mortality in patients over
the age of 80 years.192 Thus most patients with CAA and a
history of symptomatic ICH should be offered antihypertensive
treatment.
Statins
Recently, concerns have been raised over statins as a risk factor
for ICH, in light of the results of the SPARCL trial of atorvas￾tatin in patients with stroke, which showed a small increase in
the incidence of ICH among patients receiving high doses of the
drug193; the hazard was higher for patients with baseline
haemorrhagic compared with ischaemic stroke (HR 4.1 vs
1.6).194 A decision analysis showed that the risk of statin
therapy likely outweighs any potential benefit in patients with
recent lobar ICH.195 Thus although there are inadequate data for
clear recommendations on statin use,181 they should perhaps be
avoided in the setting of a recent CAA related ICH.196 For
individuals with suspected CAA based on the presence of
multiple lobar CMBs (without any associated macrobleeding)
the risks and benefit of statin therapy are uncertain.11
Disease modifying agents
An important hope for the future treatment of CAA is to
identify patients early in the natural history of the disease before
ICH or dementia occurs, to allow the use of disease modifying
therapies.197 Given the rarity of the inflammatory variant of
CAA, it is unlikely that randomised data will become available to
guide treatment, and it therefore seems reasonable to employ
anti-inflammatory and immune modulating agents.197 198
However, future treatments for the great majority of sporadic
CAA cases are likely to focus on preventing CAA progression by
decreasing the production, deposition, toxicity and/or clearance
of vascular amyloid. A candidate agent which might delay or
inhibit the progression of CAA is tramiprosate, an ionic
compound which binds soluble Ab and interferes with the
amyloid cascade.199 Tramiprosate has been shown to be a safe
treatment option for patients with suspected CAA in a phase 2
study, supporting future efficacy trials.200 Emerging data from
the use of secretases inhibitors and/or immunisation against Ab
in AD will be invaluable in guiding further efforts for disease
modification in CAA.
CONCLUSIONS
During the past decade, there have been tremendous advance￾ments in our understanding of CAA, relating to its pathophys￾iology, clinical spectrum, imaging manifestations and diagnosis.
< Sporadic CAA is a common disease of the elderly and will
become an increasingly important healthcare challenge as
populations age further.
