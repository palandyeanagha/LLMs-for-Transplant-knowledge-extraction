Abstract
Post-transplant malignancy is the major cause of later death of recipients after liver transplantation. Tumor
recurrence after liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the end stage of cirrhosis has
been frequently encountered. However, de novo hepatocellular carcinoma originating from the liver allograft has
only rarely been reported. Here we reported a case of de novo hepatocellular carcinoma developed 2 years after
living donor liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis with viral YMDD mutation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of de novo hepatocellular carcinoma in a liver graft with recurrent hepatitis B virus
infection after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis with YMDD mutation. Moreover, the de novo
cancer first presented as a lung mass with minimal liver involvement and was obscured by a pulmonary fungal
infection.

recurrence, YMDD mutation
Background
Liver transplantation (LTx) is the sole curative strategy
option for end-stage liver diseases. Transplant recipients
are thought to have increased risk of developing malig￾nancies due to their lifelong immunosuppressant require￾ment. This has become a major cause of late mortality
after LTx [1]. Carcinomas occurring in transplant recipi￾ents after LTx have been increasingly reported. Tumor
recurrence after LTx for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
in end-stage liver cirrhosis is frequently encountered,
especially with advanced HCC patients [2]. However, de
novo HCC originating from liver allograft in a patient who
received LTx for benign disease has only rarely been
reported. To date, there have only been 11 cases of de
novo HCC after LTx, reported in 8 papers in the literature
[3-11]. In this paper, we report an additional case of de
novo HCC developed after liver graft in the setting of
hepatitis B (HBV) recurrence after living donor liver
transplantation (LDLT) for HBV-related end-stage liver
cirrhosis with viral YMDD mutation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of de novo HCC in a
liver graft with HBV recurrence after LTx for HBV-related
liver cirrhosis with YMDD mutation. Moreover, the de
novo tumor first presented as a lung mass with minimal
liver involvement, and was obscured by a pulmonary
fungal infection.
Case presentation
A 36-year-old man with decompensate hepatitis-B￾related cirrhosis underwent LDLT in our hospital on 23
June 2009. His younger brother, who was virus negative
and had no evidence of tumor, donated the right lobe of
his liver. The patient was hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), hepatitis B E antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B
core antibody (HBcAb) positive. The serum tests at the
time of hospitalization showed that his HBV-DNA copy
level was 2 × 108
/L accompanied by YMDD mutation
(rtM204I). Because the patient had a 3-year history of
lamivudine treatment, adefovir was then added on for
treatment; 1 month later the serum HBV-DNA level de￾creased to 1 × 104
/L and he underwent LDLT. Preoperative

ultrasonography, computed tomography and MRI all ruled
out the presence of tumor. Histopathology of the explanted
liver also showed no evidence of malignancy, but micro￾nodular cirrhosis with lymphocytic infiltration in portal
tracts and moderate steatosis in the cirrhotic nodules was
seen. After LDLT, the patient received an immunosup￾pressive strategy consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate
mofetil and prednisone. For antivirus treatment as well as
prophylaxis of HBV recurrence, a combination of add-on
adefovir plus lamivudine and hepatitis B immune globulin
was used according to our protocol [12]. Serum HBsAg
was continually negative and hepatitis B surface antibody
(HBsAb) positive on multiple tests post transplantation
until 1.5 years later, when HBsAg was detected and
remained positive for the remainder of his follow-up
sessions. At 2 years after LDLT, the patient complained of
cough with fever. A thoracic computed tomography scan
showed a lower left lung infection with a nodule in the
hilum of the left lung; bronchofibroscopic biopsy of the
same confirmed a bulk Aspergillus infection (Figure 1).
After 2 weeks of antifungal treatment, however, his symp￾toms were not alleviated. Further ultrasonography and
MRI showed a small nodule that was only 0.7 cm in dia￾meter in segment VI of the allograft (Figure 2). At the same
time, serum tests showed his α-fetoprotein (AFP) level was
400 ng/ml and a HBV-DNA copy test was positive. Fine
needle aspiration biopsies were performed immediately for
the nodule in the liver as well as a second time for the lung
mass. Immunostaining for both specimens showed hepato￾cyte (+), AFP (+), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)
(−) and surfactant protein A (SPA) (−) indicating HCC
(Figure 3). Thus, the diagnosis was HCC with lung metas￾tasis with concurrent fungal infection. At the time of
diagnosis, the patient had normal liver function. Therefore,
his dose of tacrolimus was decreased by one-third and
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) maintained, but prednisone
stopped. He underwent radiofrequency ablation for HCC
in the liver and radiotherapy for the lung metastasis. At 3-
month follow-up, his liver imaging screen was clear.
However, more nodules were found in the lung, suggesting
uncontrolled metastasis. Our patient died from respiratory
failure due to rapid progression of the lung metastases
4 months later.
Discussion
In the last few decades, increasing numbers of patients
have been undergoing LTx worldwide. Owing to the
maintenance therapy of immunosuppressive agents, the
survival of transplant patients has greatly improved.
However, an increased risk of de novo malignancies
remains one of the major long-term complications after
LTx. Potential factors related to de novo malignancies
following LTx have been proposed as viral infection,
long-term immunosuppressive therapy, longer survival
of transplanted patients and possible malignant gene trans￾fer from donors [13,14]. The reported predominant post￾transplant de novo malignancies are post-transplantation
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and skin tumors [15].
Other disorders such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer,
breast cancer and so on have also been reported [16,17].
Developing HCC after LTx most often happens in patients
who have HCC before transplantation. Such cases are
considered as HCC recurrence and have become a serious
problem after LTx for HCC recipients. However, for non￾tumor recipients, de novo occurrence of HCC is extremely
rare, with only 11 cases reported in recent years [3-11]. In

those cases, HCC developed from 3 to 22 years after the
patient had received liver transplantation for end-stage
liver diseases (HBV-related cirrhosis in four patients,
HCV-related cirrhosis in four patients, alcoholic cirrho￾sis in two patients and Budd-Chiari syndrome in one
patient). The present work reports a case of de novo
HCC in the setting of HBV recurrence after LDLT for
HBV-related cirrhosis.
Though the exact carcinogenic mechanisms are un￾known, the etiology of HCC is strongly associated with
cirrhosis of any cause, but is most related to chronic
HBV or HCV infection [18]. Most of the reported de
novo HCC cases were related to recurrent cirrhosis,
either alcohol or viral related due to recurrent HBV or
HCV infection [3,4,7,8]. Morita et al. reported a case of
de novo HCC in a patient with sustained clearance of
HCV after LDLT. Though cirrhosis had become establi￾shed due to the HCV flare-up at 3 years after LDLT,
successful clearance was obtained by treatments there￾after [11]. In the present case, HBV recurrence had also
occurred prior to the diagnosis of de novo HCC. Faria et al.
have suggested that pretransplant HBV-DNA viral load
was positively associated with HBV recurrence at a median
recurrence time of 15 months after transplantation des￾pite receiving hepatitis B immunoglobulin, lamivudine
and/or adefovir [19]. Our patient had a high load of
HBV virus with YMDD mutation when he underwent
LTx. Entecavir and tenofovir are newer antiviral drugs for
HBV. Previous rescue therapy for chronic lamivudine￾resistant HBV included switching to entecavir and adding

adefovir or tenofovir. The lamivudine selected rtM204I/V
mutant is part of the entecavir resistance profile and the
tenofovir-lamivudine combination resistance profile [20].
At present, switching to entecavir is not recommended for
rescue therapy of lamivudine-resistant HBV. Though
individual data showed that tenofovir had good efficacy in
blocking viral replication in HBV patients with lamivudine￾resistant mutants [21], it has not been approved for HBV
in China. A systemic review showed that lamivudine plus
adefovir combined treatment was more effective and pro￾duced longer-lasting effects than other drugs to date [22].
Therefore, we applied adefovir add-on lamivudine antivirus
treatment and the HBV-DNA copy level in our patient
decreased dramatically. HBV was transiently cleared after
transplantation and regular prophylaxis therapy was given,
however, the patient still developed recurrent HBV infec￾tion 1.5 years after LDLT. Though the underlying mechan￾ism was not clear, it is possible that the HBV recurrence
could be attributed to the positive HBV-DNA viral load
before transplant. This was also considered to be strongly
associated with the HCC occurrence thereafter.
When considering de novo HCC, the time period from
LTx to the diagnosis of de novo HCC is of interest. Re￾ports in the literature show that most recurrent HCC
occurred shortly after LTx, whereas de novo HCC usually
develops several years after recurrent HBV or HCV
infection; enough time to develop cirrhosis. According
to the previously reported cases, the earliest cases of de
novo HCC occurred 3 years after LTx, and the latest oc￾curred 22 years after LTx. However, in the present case,
de novo HCC developed only 2 years after LDLT/6
months after recurrent HBV. This was a rather short
time for de novo HCC after LTx. Recently, a more pre￾cise genomic allelotyping method has been applied for
distinguishing recurrent and de novo HCC after LTx.
Multiple polymerase chain reaction amplification of the
highly polymorphic short tandem report DNA sequences
extracted from tumor tissues can effectively discriminate
between donor and recipient origin [7,10,11]. This is
extremely useful in cases where primary HCC existed
before LTx [11,23]. However, some reports considered
de novo HCC based on the clinical evidence rather than
this method [5,6,8]. Use of this method was hampered in
the present case due to technical reasons.
Neither pretransplant image studies nor intensive
histopathology of the explanted liver revealed any
evidence of malignancy existing before LTx. Moreover,
evidence was clear that de novo HCC can develop in a
short time after LTx. Vernadakis et al. reported a case of
de novo HCC diagnosed 3 years after LTx without
cirrhosis or any other clear reasons [10]. Indeed, HBV
infection can lead to HCC in the absence of cirrhosis
[18]. Therefore, it is not surprising that the recurrent
HBV infection in the present case may be associated
with the unusually rapid development of HCC without
cirrhosis. However, viral YMDD mutation might also be
associated with HCC development. Hosaka et al. repor￾ted that HCC could develop in HBV patients receiving
adefovir add-on lamivudine treatment independently
related to the YMDD mutation [24]. Thus, the positive
HBV-DNA viral load and YMDD mutation before trans￾plantation increased the risk of developing HBV recur￾rence and consequent elevated carcinogenesis after LTx
under immunosuppression therapy in the present case.
Taken together, though lacking direct genetic evidence
of donor origin, we did observe HCC shortly after LTx
that might be attributable to the HBV recurrence and
YMDD mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of de novo HCC in a liver graft with HBV
recurrence after LTx for HBV-related liver cirrhosis with
YMDD mutation.
Of interest, the present case of de novo HCC first
presented as a lung mass followed by the detection of a
minimal liver nodule that was only 7 mm. The patient
only showed symptoms of pulmonary infection during
the initial period. The existence of a pulmonary fungal
infection obscured the primary diagnosis because fungal
infection usually presents as a lung mass. We could not
determine whether the fungal infection occurred before
or as a result of obstruction of bronchi by the lung
metastasis. Nevertheless, the fungal infection suggested
a poor immunocompromised situation in the lung.
Therefore, we presume that it might have contributed to
the early lung metastasis despite a minimal liver involve￾ment, thus compromising the therapeutic effect.
Conclusions
De novo HCC is a rare finding in post-LTx patients and
may be associated with recurrent HBV infection. Patients
with positive HBV-DNA loads before LTx, especially those
with pre-existing YMDD mutations, also have a higher
risk of developing de novo HCC. In addition, unexplained
fungal infection may also warrant evaluation as a possible
cause of HCC development.
