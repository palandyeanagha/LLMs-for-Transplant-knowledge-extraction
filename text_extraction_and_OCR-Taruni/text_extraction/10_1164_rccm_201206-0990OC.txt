ABSTRACT. Rationale: Mesenchymal stem cells secrete paracrine factors that can regulate 
lung permeability and decrease inflammation, making it a potentially attractive therapy for acute 
lung injury. However, concerns exist whether mesenchymal stem cells’ immunomodulatory 
properties may have detrimental effects if targeted toward infectious etiologies of lung injury. 
Objective: Therefore, we tested the effect of mesenchymal stem cells on lung fluid balance, 
acute inflammation, and bacterial clearance. Method: We developed an Escherichia coli
pneumonia model in our ex vivo perfused human lung to test the therapeutic effects of 
mesenchymal stem cells on bacterial-induced acute lung injury. Measurements and Main 
Results: Clinical grade human mesenchymal stem cells restored alveolar fluid clearance to a 
normal level, decreased inflammation and were associated with increased bacterial killing and
reduced bacteremia, in part through increased alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and secretion 
of anti-microbial factors. Keratinocyte growth factor, a soluble factor secreted by mesenchymal 
stem cells, duplicated most of the anti-microbial effects. In subsequent in vitro studies, we 
discovered that human monocytes expressed the keratinocyte growth factor receptor, and that 
keratinocyte growth factor decreased apoptosis of human monocytes through AKT 
phosphorylation, an effect that increased bacterial clearance. Inhibition of keratinocyte growth
factor by a neutralizing antibody reduced the anti-microbial effects of mesenchymal stem cells in 
both the ex vivo perfused human lung and monocytes grown in vitro injured with Escherichia coli
bacteria. Conclusion: In Escherichia coli injured human lungs, mesenchymal stem cells
restored alveolar fluid clearance, reduced inflammation and exerted anti-microbial activity, in part 
through keratinocyte growth factor secretion.

INTRODUCTION
Despite extensive research into the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and the acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), mortality remains high[1-3]. Current treatment is supportive with 
lung protective ventilation and a fluid conservative strategy[4, 5]. Innovative therapies are 
needed. Recent studies have suggested that mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) may 
have therapeutic applications in multiple models of lung disease[6-17]. Despite initial interest in 
their multi-potent properties, engraftment in the lung does not appear to play a major therapeutic 
role. The beneficial effect of MSCs derives from their capacity to secrete paracrine factors that 
modulate immune responses and alter the responses of the endothelium or epithelium and 
inflammatory cells to injury[17-28]. Because of the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs, one 
safety concern is a potential deleterious effect on host defense against bacterial infection. 
Bacterial pneumonia and sepsis from a non-pulmonary cause are the two most common 
etiologies of ALI/ARDS[2]. However, recent studies in mice have provided evidence for the 
beneficial effects of MSCs in the treatment of sepsis[17, 29], although the mechanism for
enhanced bacterial clearance was not clearly identified. 
In the first part of this study, we hypothesized that clinical grade, cryopreserved bone 
marrow derived human allogeneic MSCs from a Good Manufacturing Practice facility would be 
as effective in restoring alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) as human MSCs cultured in vitro in our ex 
vivo perfused human lung injured with E.coli endotoxin. These clinical grade human MSCs were 
thawed and infused as they would be in a clinical trial. Clinical grade MSCs restored AFC rate to 
a normal level and decreased inflammation following endotoxin-induced ALI with similar efficacy 
as cultured human MSCs[30]. 

3
In the second part of these studies, we hypothesized that these same clinical grade 
human MSCs would be effective in an infectious model of lung injury, E.coli pneumonia. Intra￾bronchial instillation of live E.coli bacteria resulted in a marked decrease in AFC and an intense 
pro-inflammatory response. Human MSCs administration following E.coli pneumonia-induced 
lung injury fully restored AFC, decreased inflammation and reduced total bacterial load in the 
injured alveolus. During the period of this study, Wu et al. reported in a mice pneumonia model
that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) stimulated the secretion of GM-CSF by alveolar epithelial 
cells, which activated alveolar macrophages by STAT5 phosphorylation and increased the 
phagocytosis and killing of Gram-negative bacteria[31]. Previously, we reported that MSCs
secreted KGF and was an important paracrine mechanism through which MSCs restored 
vectorial ion and fluid transport in injured human alveolar epithelial type II cells[30]. To determine 
if KGF secretion by MSCs was involved in bacterial killing, we conducted studies with MSCs or 
KGF in the ex vivo perfused human lung and isolated blood monocytes exposed to E.coli
bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Ex Vivo Perfused Human Lung and In Vitro Monocyte Studies. A detailed description of the 
ex vivo perfused human lung as previously published[30] and blood monocytes grown in vitro
injured with E.coli bacteria as well as the measurement of various parameters such as AFC, 
percent phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages and total neutrophil and bacterial CFU counts in 
the alveolar fluid or conditioned medium can be found in the Online Data Supplement. All 
other techniques and reagents used are standard.

Data Analysis Plan. Results were expressed as the mean  SD if the data was normally 
distributed. Comparisons between two groups were made using the unpaired t-test. 
Comparisons with a sample over time were made by repeated measures of analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) using the Bonferroni correction for multiple-comparison testing using Statview (SAS 
Institute Inc.). 
RESULTS
Clinical Grade Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Restored Alveolar Fluid Clearance 
Following E.coli Endotoxin Induced Acute Lung Injury. Similar to our prior work with cultured 
human MSCs[30], instillation of 5 x 106 clinical grade human MSCs processed as if in a clinical 
trial and given intra-bronchially (IB) or into the perfusate (IV) 1 h following endotoxin-induced ALI 
restored AFC to a normal level at 4 h (Supplemental Figure E1A in the Online Data 
Supplement). Instillation of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) as cellular controls had no 
effect. Instillation of human MSCs also significantly decreased IL-1 and IL-8 levels in the injured 
alveolus, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect (Supplemental Figure E1B in the Online Data 
Supplement). In addition, PKH26 labeled human MSCs preferentially migrated to endotoxin￾injured lung tissue; PKH26 labeled MSCs was observed in the alveolar space 2.5 times more 
often in the endotoxin-injured alveoli than in the uninjured controls (Supplemental Figure E2 in 
the Online Data Supplement). To test the effect of these clinical grade human MSCs on an 
infectious cause of ALI, we developed an E.coli pneumonia model in the ex vivo perfused human 
lung (Figure 1). 

5
Effect of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Fluid Clearance and Inflammatory 
Cell Infiltration into the Injured Lung Following E.coli Pneumonia. Instillation of 109 colony 
forming units (CFU) of E.coli markedly impaired AFC by 80%, increased the influx of neutrophils 
into the injured alveolus, and was associated histologically with inflammatory cells influx, 
thickening of the interstitium and hemorrhage at 6 h. Instillation of 5 x 106 human MSCs IB or IV
1 h following E.coli induced lung injury restored AFC rate to a normal level (Figure 2A), reduced 
the absolute neutrophil count in the alveolus to baseline (Figure 2B), and restored the lung 
morphology to nearly normal by histology (Figure 2C). Instillation of NHLF as cellular controls 
had no beneficial effect. Although not statistically significant by ANOVA, administration of human 
MSCs IV 1 h following E.coli pneumonia reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in a dose 
dependent manner; doubling the dose of MSCs to 10 x 106 cells reduced IL-1 level by 63% and 
TNF by 87% in the alveolar fluid as compared to E.coli injured lung lobes (IL-1: 1193  549 for 
E.coli, 926  156 treatment with MSC (1X), 437  345 treatment with MSC (2X); TNF: 3019 
1767 for E.coli, 1604  377 treatment with MSC (1X), 384  189 treatment with MSC (2X), 
values are mean  SD pg/ml, N = 3-4).
Effect of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Bacterial Load Following E.coli
Pneumonia. Instillation human MSCs IB or IV 1 h following E.coli pneumonia significantly 
reduced the bacterial load at 6 h in the injured alveolus (Figure 3A). Instillation of NHLF had no 
effect. Doubling the dose of MSCs to 10 x 106 cells IV decreased the bacterial load by an 
additional 40% from E.coli pneumonia, suggesting a dose response. To determine if MSCs
secreted anti-microbial peptides/proteins into the injured alveolus, we removed cells and 

6
bacteria from the alveolar fluid of lungs exposed to E.coli with and without MSCs therapy and re￾exposed this alveolar conditioned medium to E.coli in vitro. Alveolar fluid from lungs treated with 
MSCs had increased anti-microbial activity compared to the lungs exposed to E.coli alone
(Figure 3B). Doubling the dose of MSCs to 10 x 106 cells IV to E.coli injured human lungs further 
increased the anti-microbial activity of the alveolar fluid.
Effect of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytosis of E.coli
Bacteria. In addition to the anti-microbial factors secreted by MSCs[32, 33], recent evidence 
showed that MSCs could increase bacterial clearance by enhancing monocyte phagocytosis[29]. 
Therefore, we tested the effect of MSCs on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis in the human 
lung injured with E.coli. Although there was no significant difference in total alveolar macrophage 
counts, instillation of human MSCs IB 1 h following E.coli pneumonia significantly increased the 
phagocytosis % and index of alveolar macrophages against E.coli bacteria at 6 h. Although not 
statistically significant, instillation of human MSCs IV 1 h following E.coli pneumonia also 
increased the phagocytosis % and index of alveolar macrophages against E.coli bacteria by 
80% and 110% respectively at 6 h. (Figure 4). 
Effect of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Human Lung Injured with E.coli Pneumonia
for Ten Hours. To determine if the therapeutic effect of MSCs would persist in human lungs
injured with E.coli bacteria for a longer time period, we extended the pneumonia model to 10 h, 
increased the bacterial load to 1010 CFU of E.coli in order to cause bacteremia and administered 
the MSCs IB 2 h following the induction of injury. Similar to the results at 6 h, MSC 
administration restored AFC, reduced the inflammatory cell infiltration into the injured alveolus 

7
and decreased the total bacterial load at 10 h. In addition, MSCs eliminated the bacteremia 
present following the more severe pneumonia (Figure 5A-D). In separate experiments, to 
determine the effect of antibiotics alone, we administered 0.2 gm ampicillin into the perfusate at 
1 h. The antibiotic treatment restored most of the parameters of lung injury, but there was no 
effect on AFC. However, the addition of IB MSCs at 2 h following IV ampicillin at 1 h significantly 
restored AFC and had an additive effect in reducing the total bacterial load in both the injured 
alveolus and the perfusate following the induction of the pneumonia.
Effect of Human KGF on E.coli Pneumonia. Although not statistically significant, 
administration of human MSCs IB or IV following E.coli pneumonia increased the levels of KGF
by 20% and 40% respectively in the alveolar fluid compared to E.coli injured lung lobes (29  18
for E.coli, 34  30 treatment with MSC IB, 40  17 treatment with MSC IV (1X), values are mean 
 SD pg/ml, N =3-4). Based on our prior publication which identified KGF as a key paracrine
secreted protein by MSCs that enhanced AFC following ALI[30] and a recent study which 
reported an anti-microbial effect of KGF for both Gram positive and negative pneumonia[31], we 
tested the hypothesis that recombinant human KGF would replicate some of the effects of 
MSCs. Similar to MSCs, KGF (100 ng) IB 1 h following E.coli pneumonia was as effective as 
human MSCs in treating several parameters of ALI: the loss of alveolar fluid clearance, increase 
in inflammatory cell influx into the injured alveolus, the increase in alveolar E.coli bacterial load
and a decrease in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis (Figure 6A - D). 
Effect of KGF on Blood Monocytes. Wu et al. recently demonstrated that the anti-microbial 
effect of KGF[31]. To determine if KGF had a direct effect on macrophage/monocyte activity 

8
against bacteria, we exposed blood monocytes to KGF and tested their efficacy in bacterial 
killing. The addition of KGF to human blood monocytes increased E.coli bacteria killing by 20% 
(Figure 7A). This was a modest effect compared to the bacterial killing in Figure 3A but 
statistically significant. By both RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses, human blood monocytes 
expressed both the mRNA and protein for FGFR2, the receptor for KGF (Figure 7B). The 
addition of KGF decreased LDH release following 24 h, an effect that was associated with an 
increase in intra-cellular AKT phosphorylation at 1 h (Figure 7C & D), indicating that KGF 
increased the survival of monocytes, one possible additional mechanism for increased bacterial 
clearance. Although not statistically significant, STAT5 phosphorylation was elevated by 20% 
with KGF treatment. In separate experiments, we administered several doses of KGF (10 ng/ml 
to 1 g/ml) to monocytes in vitro and found that there was a dose dependent response on both 
LDH release and bacteria killing (Supplemental Figure E3 in the Online Supplement).
Effect of Human MSCs on Blood Monocytes. Similar to the effect of KGF, the simultaneous 
addition of human MSCs, mixed together or separated by a Transwell plate, with human blood 
monocytes increased E.coli bacterial killing by 25% and 50%, respectively (Figure 8A). The 
level of TNF was also decreased and the level of IL-10 was increased, suggesting an anti￾inflammatory effect (Figure 8B). To determine if MSCs reprogrammed the monocytes to an anti￾inflammatory cell with an increase in phagocytosis, gene markers of M2 phenotype were 
measured by RT-PCR. However, MSCs did not increase the expression of human MRC1 and 
Arginase on the monocytes (Supplemental Figure E4 in the Online Supplement). Human 
MSCs, whether mixed together or separated by a Transwell plate, with human blood monocytes 
also increased GM-CSF secretion by 17x and 6x from baseline (Figure 8C); in the perfused 

9
human lung at 6 h, MSCs administration IB or IV at 1 h increased GM-CSF levels by 200% and 
80% respectively in the injured alveolus. The addition of KGF or human MSCs also had a
similar effect on human blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days to acquire the phenotype of 
alveolar macrophages, in terms of bacterial killing (Figure 8D). Finally, inhibition of KGF by a 
neutralizing antibody abrogated the anti-microbial effect of human MSCs in both the ex vivo
perfused human lung and cultured blood monocytes in vitro, demonstrating the importance of 
KGF secretion in bacterial killing. In separate experiments, inhibition of GM-CSF by a 
neutralizing antibody also abrogated the anti-microbial effect of MSCs in vitro, indicating an 
additional paracrine factor with anti-microbial properties (Figure 9A - C). 
DISCUSSION
The primary findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: (1) Clinical grade, 
cryopreserved allogeneic human MSCs were as effective as cultured MSCs in restoring AFC 
following E.coli endotoxin-induced ALI whether these MSCs were given IB or IV (Supplemental 
Figure E1 in the Online Data Supplement); (2) clinical grade human MSCs were also effective 
in restoring normal AFC following E.coli pneumonia-induced ALI whether given IB or IV (Figure 
2A); (3) the restoration of AFC by human MSCs following E.coli pneumonia was associated with 
increased bacterial killing, explained in part by an increase in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis 
and secretion of anti-microbial soluble factors (Figure 3 & 4); (4) the therapeutic effects of 
human MSCs on E.coli pneumonia was duplicated in separate experiments with the intra￾bronchial instillation of KGF, a paracrine factor secreted by MSCs and previously found to be 

10
important for net fluid transport[30] (Figure 6); (5) both human MSCs and KGF in co-culture 
experiments increased the anti-microbial effect of human blood monocytes, which expressed the 
KGF receptor by RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first 
demonstration that KGF activates monocytes directly, not through epithelial cells, to increase the 
anti-microbial activity of monocytes (Figure 7 & 8); (6) human MSCs or KGF had a similar anti￾microbial effect on monocytes grown in vitro for 1 week to acquire the phenotype of 
macrophages (Figure 8D); (7) inhibition of KGF by a neutralizing antibody abrogated the anti￾microbial effect of MSCs on alveolar macrophages or blood monocytes against E.coli (Figure 9); 
(8) KGF increased AKT phosphorylation and decreased LDH release by blood monocytes in a 
dose dependent manner, suggesting an anti-apoptotic effect as an additional explanation for the 
increase in bacterial clearance (Figure 7C & D & Supplemental Figure E3 in the Online 
Supplement); (9) in co-culture experiments, human MSCs secreted higher levels of GM-CSF, 
suggesting another paracrine mechanism for the increase in bacterial phagocytosis of 
monocytes (Figure 8C); (10) MSCs in vitro decreased TNF and increased IL-10 secretion by 
monocytes injured by LPS, indicating an immunomodulatory effect (Figure 8B); and (11) in 
experiments in which the duration of E.coli pneumonia was increased to 10 h, MSC had an 
additive effect on injured lungs that were treated with IV antibiotics in restoring AFC and further
reducing the bacterial load in the injured alveolus and perfusate (Figure 5).
Recent studies have provided evidence for the beneficial effects of MSCs in the treatment 
of bacterial-induced sepsis and pneumonia. In the mouse model of sepsis, Nemeth et al. found 
that syngeneic MSCs reduced mortality, improved organ function and decreased total bacterial 
counts in the blood and peritoneal fluid, in part by the secretion of PGE2[17]. Gonzales-Rey et al. 
reported the protective effect of adipose tissue-derived human and mouse MSCs in mouse 

11
experimental colitis and sepsis, which was associated with improved bacterial clearance[34]. 
However, the actual mechanisms underlying enhanced bacterial clearance were not clearly 
identified.
Macrophages and monocytes play an important role in the production of inflammatory 
mediators during sepsis, and they appear to be a major cell target in the protective effect of 
MSCs. Mei et al. reported that the improvement in bacterial clearance in syngeneic MSCs
treated septic mice could be in part explained by enhanced phagocytic activity of splenic 
monocytes[29]; these authors demonstrated enhancement of phagocytosis in the CD11+ cell 
population isolated from mouse spleen after MSCs treatment. Kim and Hematti[35] reported that 
human MSCs improved phagocytic activity of monocyte-derived macrophages when co-cultured 
in vitro. They reported that co-culture of human MSCs and macrophages induced an alternative 
state (M2) of macrophage activation, which is characterized by anti-inflammatory properties and 
more potent phagocytic activity. In a mouse model of peritoneal sepsis induced by Gram 
negative bacteria, we recently found that blood monocytes isolated from mice treated with MSC 
showed increased phagocytic activity compared to monocytes from control groups[36]. We also 
demonstrated that MSCs can inhibit bacterial growth directly in part through the secretion of 
antimicrobial peptide/proteins, such as LL-37 and Lipocalin-2[32, 33]. More recently, several 
investigators found that MSCs have Toll-like and formyl peptide-like receptors and become 
activated in response to different bacterial products, suggesting that MSCs may be directly 
involved in innate immune response[13, 37]. 
In this study, we identified several mechanisms underlying the anti-microbial effect of 
MSCs, primarily dependent on the secretion of KGF. KGF is a potent epithelial specific mitogen 
and differentiation factor that plays a central role in development and repair of injured epithelial 

12
tissues[38]. KGF is produced exclusively by mesenchymal cells and act on epithelial cells 
through the alternatively spliced FGF-2 tyrosine kinase receptor, FGFR2-IIIb. Recombinant KGF 
pretreatment reduced mortality following intra-tracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid[39, 40], 
bleomycin[41, 42], hyperoxia[43, 44] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa[45]. The protective effects
of KGF have been linked to stimulation of type II cell proliferation and differentiation, DNA repair, 
up-regulated alveolar epithelial vectorial ion and fluid transport, and enhanced surfactant lipid 
and protein production. More recently, Wu et al. also found that KGF enhanced the clearance of 
E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ALI in mice in part through the augmentation of 
recruitment, phagocytic activity and oxidant responses of alveolar macrophages[31]. However, in 
these studies, KGF treatment was only effective if given prior to or simultaneous with the injury.
In our studies, MSCs or KGF given as therapy decreased the bacterial load in the ex vivo
perfused human lung injured by E.coli pneumonia (Figure 3A & 6C). In addition, both MSCs and 
KGF increased the phagocytosis and killing of both human alveolar macrophages and 
monocytes against E.coli bacteria, in part through a direct anti-apoptotic effect (Figure 7 & 8),
and possibly through the release of GM-CSF or other anti-microbial peptide/proteins by alveolar 
epithelial cells or by MSCs itself (Figure 8C). These beneficial effects of MSCs supplemented 
the benefit of antibiotics in perfused human lung injured to 10 h (Figure 5). The importance of 
KGF secretion was confirmed in these experiments because administration of an anti-human 
KGF antibody abolished the anti-microbial effect of MSCs (Figure 9). Although MSCs decreased 
TNF and increased IL-10 secretion by monocytes following LPS stimulation in vitro, suggesting 
an immunomodulatory phenotype (Figure 8B), we did not find an increase in MRC1 or arginase 
expression in monocytes, markers of the M2 phenotype (Supplemental Figure E4 in the 
Online Data Supplement). 

13
There are some limitations to the current studies. It is unclear if the anti-microbial 
properties of MSCs are dependent on cell-cell contact or the inflammatory milieu, or both. For 
instance, MSCs had a more significant effect on suppressing the release of TNF and 
increasing GM-CSF secretion by 300% in vitro if the cells were mixed together with the 
monocytes following LPS stimulation compared to separation by a Transwell plate (Figure 8B & 
C). In addition, Islam et al. recently reported that MSC formed connexin 43 gap junctional 
channels with LPS injured alveolar epithelium in mice, releasing mitochondria-containing 
microvesicles that the epithelium engulfed, which restored alveolar ATP levels and reduced lung 
injury[46]. The contribution of cell-mediated effects on both the alveolar epithelium and
macrophages to understand the net therapeutic activity of MSC will need to be further studied to 
determine if MSCs are more potent than the individual secreted peptides/proteins, such as KGF.
In conclusion, clinical grade, cryopreserved allogeneic human MSCs are therapeutic in 
E.coli pneumonia in the ex vivo perfused human lung. The effects are mediated by the capacity
of MSCs to suppress anti-inflammatory responses, restore AFC to a normal level, and to 
enhance bacterial clearance, including the ability to prevent translocation of bacteria into the 
blood stream. The anti-microbial effects of MSCs could be largely duplicated by KGF, a major 
paracrine product of MSCs. In both ex vivo and in vitro studies, MSCs or KGF increased alveolar 
macrophage or blood monocyte phagocytosis and killing of E.coli bacteria, explained in part by a 
decrease in monocyte apoptosis through AKT phosphorylation. In addition, MSCs secreted GM￾CSF, a cytokine previously found to have significant anti-microbial activity[31]. These anti￾microbial properties of MSCs may reduce concern for clinical testing of cell-based therapy with 
significant immune-suppressive effects following sepsis or pneumonia induced ALI. From the 
perspective of evolutionary biology, it is remarkable that MSCs have evolved the capacity to 

14
inhibit bacterial growth, reduce acute inflammation, and enhance the function of a tight epithelial 
barrier that has been injured by pathogenetic bacteria.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Escherichia coli Pneumonia in the Ex Vivo Perfused 
Human Lung. The right or left human lung declined for transplantation by the Northern 
California Transplant Donor Network is selected for perfusion if the total ischemic time is < 48 h 
and if the selection criteria as described in the methods are met. The lung is gently rewarmed 
and perfused with a crystalloid solution (DME H-21 with 5% albumin) over 1 h and oxygenated 
with 10 cmH2O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (FiO2 0.95). The perfusion rate or 
cardiac output is set at 0.2 liter/min and the left atrial pressure at 0 mmHg to prevent hydrostatic 
pulmonary edema. If the AFC rate  10%/h in the control RUL or LUL, then 109 CFU of E.coli 
bacteria (K1 strain) is instilled into the RML or LLL and 100 ml of fresh whole blood is added to 
the perfusate. For MSCs treatment groups, human MSCs are instilled intra-bronchially (IB) into 
the RML or LLL or into the perfusate (IV) 1 h following the initiation of the injury.
Figure 2. Effect of Clinical Grade, Cryopreserved Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem 
Cells on Alveolar Fluid Clearance and on Inflammatory Cell Infiltration into the Injured 
Lung Lobe and Histology Following Escherichia coli Pneumonia. (A) Instillation of clinical 
grade, cryopreserved human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells IB or IV restored the decrease 
in AFC in the lung lobe injured by E.coli pneumonia at 6 h. AFC was measured by the change in 
protein concentration of a 5% albumin instillate in the lung lobe over 1 h and expressed as mean 
AFC (%/h, per 150 ml of BAL) ± SD for each condition. N = 20 for control lobe, N = 4 for E.coli
injured lung lobe, N = 3 for Ecoli injured lung lobe treated with MSCs IB or IV or NHLF, * P< 
0.008 compared to controls by ANOVA (Bonferroni). (B) Instillation of clinical grade MSCs IB or 
IV decreased the influx of inflammatory cells, specifically neutrophils, into the lung lobe injured 

23
by E.coli pneumonia at 6 h. Absolute neutrophil counts are expressed as mean total neutrophil
counts (x 107 cells) ± SD for each condition. N = 20 for control lobe, N = 4 for E.coli injured lung 
lobe, N = 3 for Ecoli injured lung lobe treated with MSCs IB or IV or NHLF, * P<0.0001 compared 
to controls by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.0002 vs. E.coli pneumonia by ANOVA (Bonferroni). 
There was no statistical difference in the absolute alveolar macrophage counts between groups. 
(C) Human lungs exposed to E.coli bacteria with and without MSCs were fixed in 10% formalin 
at 6 h. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The administration of human MSCs 1 
h after E.coli pneumonia injury reduced the level of hemorrhage, edema and cellularity in the 
injured lung lobe at 6 h. 
Figure 3. Effect of Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Escherichia
coli Bacterial Load Following Escherichia coli Pneumonia. (A) Instillation of clinical grade, 
cryopreserved human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells IB or IV decreased the total bacterial 
load in the lung lobe injured by E.coli pneumonia at 6 h. Total bacterial counts were expressed 
as mean (x 106 CFU counts/ml) ± SD for each condition. N = 18 for control lobe, N = 3 for E.coli
injured lung lobe with or without administration of MSCs IB or IV or NHLF, * P<0.0005 vs. control 
CFU counts/ml by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.0001 vs. E.coli pneumonia CFU counts/ml by 
ANOVA (Bonferroni). (B) The alveolar fluid conditioned medium of lung lobes treated with 
human MSCs IB or IV had increased anti-microbial activity against E.coli bacteria re-exposed in 
vitro. Total bacterial counts were expressed as mean (x 104 CFU counts/ml) ± SD for each 
condition. N = 19 for control lobe, N = 4 for E.coli injured lung lobe, N = 3 for Ecoli injured lung 
lobe treated with MSCs IB or IV or NHLF, * P<0.0005 vs. control CFU counts/ml by ANOVA 
(Bonferroni).

Figure 4. Effect of Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Macrophage 
Phagocytosis of Escherichia coli Bacteria. (A) A representative alveolar macrophage found 
from cytospin slides of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the injured alveolus under different 
treatment conditions: IB MSCs, IV MSCs and IB KGF. (B) The instillation of human MSCs IB 1 h 
following E.coli pneumonia significantly increased the percent phagocytosis and phagocytosis 
index of alveolar macrophages against E.coli bacteria at 6 h. Although not statistically 
significant, the instillation of human MSCs IV 1 h following E.coli pneumonia increased the 
percent phagocytosis and phagocytosis index of alveolar macrophages against E.coli bacteria 
by 80% and 110% respectively at 6 h. The percent phagocytosis (1) and phagocytosis index (2) 
were calculated by (1) quantifying the number of alveolar macrophages containing bacteria out 
of 100 macrophages from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 3 different lung preparations per 
condition and (2) quantifying the average number of bacteria per macrophage in 100 
macrophages containing the bacteria from 3 different lung preparations per condition. The 
values are expressed as mean ± SD for each condition. N = 3. * P< 0.05 for % phagocytosis and 
* P< 0.03 for phagocytosis index. 
Figure 5. Effect of Antibiotics and/or Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Escherichia coli
Pneumonia at Ten Hours. We extended the ex vivo perfused human lung model injured with 
E.coli pneumonia to 10 h to determine if MSC treatment would be therapeutic if given at a later 
time-point. We also increased the E.coli IB dose to 1010 CFU from 109 CFU to cause a transient 
bacteremia in the perfusate. Similar to the previous set of experiments at 6 h, IB MSC restored 
all the parameters of lung injury when given 2 h following the induction of E.coli pneumonia: (A) 

25
the loss of alveolar fluid clearance. AFC is expressed as mean AFC (%/h, per 150 ml of BAL) ± 
SD for each condition. N = 12 for control lobe, N = 3 for E.coli injured lung lobe treated with or 
without administration of MSCs or ampicillin IV  MSCs, * P<0.0001 vs. control,  P<0.0.0001 
vs. E.coli and # P<0.0005 vs. E.coli + IV Amp AFC by ANOVA (Bonferroni); (B) the influx of 
neutrophils into the injured alveolus. Absolute neutrophil counts are expressed as mean total 
neutrophil counts (x 107 cells) ± SD for each condition; (C) the increase in the total bacterial 
CFU counts in the injured alveolus. Total bacterial counts were expressed as mean (x 106 CFU 
counts/ml) ± SD for each condition. * P<0.002 vs. control CFU counts/ml by ANOVA 
(Bonferroni); (D) the bacteremia present in the perfusate. The highest bacterial count found in 
the perfusate/h was expressed as mean (x 106 CFU counts/ml) ± SD for each condition. * 
P<0.0001 vs. control,  P<004 vs. E.coli CFU counts/ml by ANOVA (Bonferroni). Treatment of 
E.coli pneumonia with ampicillin (0.2 gm) IV at 1 h restored most of the parameters of ALI similar 
to MSCs except for the restoration of AFC (A-D). The addition of IB MSC at 2 h given following 
IV Amp at 1 h following E.coli pneumonia had an additive effect in restoring AFC rate in the 
injured alveolus as well as decreasing the total bacterial load in both the alveolus and perfusate 
(C-D). 
Figure 6. Effect of Recombinant Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor on Escherichia coli
Pneumonia. KGF instillation (100 ng) IB 1 h following E.coli pneumonia restored many of the 
parameters of ALI similar to MSCs: (A) Instillation of KGF IB restored the decrease in AFC in 
the lung lobe injured by E.coli pneumonia at 6 h. AFC is expressed as mean AFC (%/h, per 150 
ml of BAL) ± SD for each condition. N = 20 for control lobe, N = 3-4 for E.coli injured lung lobe
treated with or without KGF, * P<0.009 vs. control AFC by ANOVA (Bonferroni); (B) Instillation of 

26
KGF IB decreased the influx of neutrophils into the injured lung lobe at 6 h. Absolute neutrophil 
counts are expressed as mean total neutrophil counts (x 107 cells) ± SD for each condition. N = 
20 for control lobe, N = 4 for E.coli injured lung lobe treated with or without KGF, * P<0.0001 vs. 
control by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.006 vs. E.coli pneumonia by ANOVA (Bonferroni); (C) 
Instillation of KGF IB decreased the total bacterial load in the injured lung lobe at 6 h. Total 
bacterial counts were expressed as mean (x 106 CFU counts/ml) ± SD for each condition. N = 18
for control lobe, N = 3 for E.coli injured lung lobe with or without KGF, * P<0.007 vs. control CFU 
counts/ml by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.0001 vs. E.coli pneumonia CFU counts/ml by ANOVA 
(Bonferroni); and (D) Instillation of KGF IB 1 h following E.coli pneumonia significantly increased 
the percent phagocytosis and phagocytosis index of alveolar macrophages against E.coli
bacteria at 6 h. The values are expressed as mean ± SD for each condition. N = 3. * P< 0.03 for 
% phagocytosis and * P< 0.05 for phagocytosis index.
Figure 7. Effect of Recombinant Keratinocyte Growth Factor on Peripheral Blood 
Monocytes. (A) The simultaneous addition of KGF (100 ng/ml) to isolated human blood 
monocytes increased E.coli bacteria killing by 20%. Total bacterial counts were expressed as 
mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 14-16, * P<0.0001 vs. control CFU count; (B) 
By both RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses, human blood monocytes were found to express 
both the mRNA and protein for FGFR2, the receptor for KGF. Primary cultures of human 
alveolar epithelial type II cells (TII) were used as a positive control; (C & D) The addition of KGF 
decreased LDH release following 24 h, which was associated with an increase in intra-cellular 
AKT phosphorylation at 1 h. LDH released was expressed as mean (% of total LDH) ± SD for 
each condition. N = 20-24, * P<0.0008 vs. control LDH release; the ratio of phosphorylated 

27
AKT/Total AKT was expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 10, * P<0.03 
vs. control P-AKT/Tot AKT ratio. The ratio of phosphorylated STAT5/Total STAT5 was 
expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 10, * P>0.05 vs. control P￾STAT5/Tot STAT5 ratio. 
Figure 8. Effect of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Peripheral Blood Monocytes. (A) 
The simultaneous addition of human MSCs, mixed together or separated by a Transwell plate, 
with isolated human blood monocyte increased E.coli bacteria killing. Total bacterial counts were 
expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 8-15, * P<0.0002 vs. control CFU 
counts; (B) In addition, the level of TNF was decreased and the level of IL-10 was increased, 
suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. The TNF level was expressed as mean (% of control) ± 
SD for each condition. N = 8-11, * P<0.02 vs. control and  P<0.0001 vs. MSCs (Transwell) for 
TNF level. The IL-10 level was expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 
8-11, * P<0.03 vs. control for IL-10 level. (C) Human MSCs, whether mixed together or 
separated by a Transwell plate, with human blood monocytes increased GM-CSF secretion by 
17x and 6x from baseline. The GM-CSF level was expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for 
each condition. N = 8-15, * P<0.003 vs. control and  P<0.0001 vs. MSCs (Transwell) for GM￾CSF level. (D) The addition of KGF or human MSCs had the same anti-microbial effect on 
monocytes cultured for 7 days to take on the phenotype of alveolar macrophages. Total bacterial 
counts were expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition. N = 4, * P<0.05 vs. 
control CFU counts/ml and  P<0.05 vs. KGF CFU counts/ml.

Figure 9. Effect of Anti-Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor or Anti-Granulocyte 
Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Neutralizing Antibody on the Effect of Human 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Macrophages and Peripheral Blood Monocytes. The 
inhibition of KGF by a neutralizing antibody abrogated the anti-microbial effect of human MSCs 
on (A) alveolar macrophages in the ex vivo perfused human lung and (B) blood monocytes 
cultured in vitro. (C) Similar to anti-KGF Ab, the inhibition of GM-CSF by a neutralizing antibody 
abrogated the anti-microbial effect of human MSCs in vitro. Total bacterial counts in the alveolar 
fluid for the perfused human lung were expressed as mean (x 106 CFU counts/ml) ± SD for each 
condition. N = 3-5, * P<0.05 vs. MSCs CFU counts/ml treated with Goat Control IgG. Total 
bacterial counts for monocytes grown in vitro were expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for 
each condition. N = 8-9. For anti-KGF Ab, * P<0.05 vs. MSCs treated with Goat Control IgG. N 
= 14-16. For anti-GM CSF Ab, * P<0.04 vs. MSCs treated with Goat Control IgG.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Alveolar Fluid Clearance Following Escherichia coli
Endotoxin Induced Acute Lung Injury. (A) Instillation of clinical grade, cryopreserved human 
allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells IB or IV restored the decrease in AFC in the lung lobe 
injured by E.coli endotoxin at 4 h. AFC was measured by the change in protein concentration of 
a 5% albumin instillate in the lung lobe over 1 h and expressed as mean AFC (%/h, per 150 ml 
of BAL) ± SD for each condition. N = 12 for control lobe, N = 6 for endotoxin, N = 3 for endotoxin

the alveolar fluid of the lung lobe injured by E.coli endotoxin at 4 h. N = 14 for control lobe, N = 8
for endotoxin, N = 3 for endotoxin injured lung lobe with or without administration of MSCs IB or 
IV, * P<0.0001 vs. control by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.0001 vs. LPS (0.1 mg/kg) by ANOVA

mg/kg) by ANOVA (Bonferroni) for IL-8.
Supplemental Figure E2. Trafficking of PKH26 Labeled Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Ex 
Vivo Perfused Human Lung Injured with Escherichia coli Endotoxin. Although not 
statistically significant, PKH26 labeled MSCs preferentially trafficked into the alveolar space 
injured with E.coli endotoxin than to the control uninjured lung lobe. The movement of the 
labeled MSCs was not effected by the level of perfusion of the lung lobe. The number of MSCs 
in the alveolar space in the control lung lobe was the same whether the control lobe was the 
RUL or the RLL. N =3.
Supplemental Figure E3. Dose Dependent Effect of Recombinant Keratinocyte Growth 
Factor on Peripheral Blood Monocytes. (A) The addition of increasing amount of KGF 
decreased LDH release in a dose dependent manner following 24 h. LDH released was 
expressed as mean (% of total LDH) ± SD for each condition. N = 15-21, * P<0.001 vs. control 
LDH release by ANOVA (Bonferroni),  P<0.0006 vs. LPS + 1 g/ml LDH release by ANOVA 
(Bonferroni). (B) The simultaneous addition of increasing amounts of KGF (10 ng/ml to 1 g/ml) 
to isolated human blood monocytes increased E.coli bacteria killing in a dose dependent 
manner. Total bacterial counts were expressed as mean (% of control) ± SD for each condition.

Supplemental Figure E4. Effect of Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on 
Expression of Markers for M2 Monocyte Phenotype. Blood monocytes co-cultured with 
human MSCs did not increase the expression of mannose receptor C type 1 (MRC1) or arginase 
by RT-PCR. Both cellular markers are representative of the M2 or the anti-inflammatory 
phenotype of monocytes/macrophages. N=4.
