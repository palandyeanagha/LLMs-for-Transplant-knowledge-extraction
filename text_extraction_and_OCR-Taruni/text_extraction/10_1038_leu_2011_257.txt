Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a serious
complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans￾plantation (HCT). In 2005 the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
established new criteria for chronic GVHD based on retro￾spective data and expert recommendations. We prospectively
evaluated the incidence of NIH-defined chronic GVHD and its
prognostic impact in 178 consecutive patients. The cumulative
incidence of chronic GVHD at 3 years was 64, 48 and 16% for
chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome. Prior acute GVHD
and myeloablative conditioning were significantly associated
with increased risk of chronic GVHD. Three-year survival
(overall survival (OS)) for late-acute GVHD, chronic classic
and overlap chronic GVHD when assigned on day 100 were
69, 83 and 73%. OS was significantly worse for patients with
platelet counts below 100 g/l at onset of chronic GVHD
(35% versus 86%, Po0.0001) and progressive as compared
with de novo and quiescent onset of chronic GVHD (54.5%
versus 89.5% versus 84%, P ¼ 0.022 and 0.001). Peak severity of
chronic GVHD had no impact on non-relapse mortality (NRM)
and OS. Recurrent acute GVHD, platelet counts below 100 g/l at
diagnosis of chronic GVHD, progressive onset of chronic GVHD
and advanced disease stage prior to HCT were significantly
associated with increased NRM. This prospective analysis
provides for the first-time data on the incidence rates of NIH￾defined chronic GVHD categories and identified risk factors
for the occurrence of chronic GVHD. A prognostic value of
thrombocytopenia and progressive onset type of chronic GVHD
for survival after HCT was observed in NIH-defined chronic
GVHD.

Introduction
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious compli￾cation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HCT), affecting up to 80% of patients otherwise cured of their
underlying hematologic or oncologic disease.1,2 Chronic GVHD
substantially impairs patients’ quality of life and daily activities,
and is the leading cause of late transplant-related mortality.3,4
Affected patients can present a variety of clinical manifestations
resembling autoimmune disorders.5 Historically, the presence
of any symptoms of GVHD beyond 100 days after HCT was
called chronic GVHD, even if the manifestations could not
be distinguished from acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was
stratified as limited and extensive.6,7
In 2005 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published
consensus criteria for diagnosis, organ scoring and global
assessment of chronic GVHD recommending the distinction of
acute and chronic GVHD by clinical manifestations and not
time after HCT.5 Furthermore, chronic GVHD was stratified into
chronic classic GVHD presenting with manifestations that can
be ascribed only to chronic GVHD and overlap syndrome that
has diagnostic or distinctive chronic GVHD manifestations
together with features typical of acute GVHD.5 Severity of
chronic GVHD was graded by the NIH consensus according to
number of organs involved and the degree of functional
impairment in the affected organs.5 Currently, it is unclear
whether pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in chronic
classic GVHD differ from the ones leading to overlap syndrome.
As the proposed NIH criteria were based on expert opinion,
retrospective analyses performed by several investigators
assessed their validity.8–12 Reclassification of patients with
GVHD beyond day 100 after HCT according to the NIH
consensus criteria revealed persistent, recurrent or delayed
(‘late’) acute GVHD in 9–37% of patients who historically
would have been considered to have chronic GVHD.8–12 In
three previous studies worse overall survival (OS) was observed
in patients with late acute GVHD compared with those with
NIH chronic GVHD,8,10,13 whereas in two others no statistically
significant differences in OS were seen.9,11 The discrepant
results among these studies may be explained by inadequacies
of medical records in documenting the presence or absence of
diagnostic and distinctive manifestations of chronic GVHD
according to NIH criteria. Therefore, prospective studies are
needed to determine the impact of the NIH criteria on outcomes
of patients with GVHD beyond day 100 after HCT. Furthermore,
it is currently unclear whether survival rates are similar or
different between the two newly defined subtypes of chronic
GVHD. In addition, the impact of known risk factors such as
progressive onset type of chronic GVHD and thrombocytopenia
at diagnosis of chronic GVHD on survival and non-relapse
mortality (NRM) has not been assessed yet in NIH-defined
chronic GVHD.

Here, we present data on 178 patients transplanted at a single
institution and prospectively assessed for presence or absence of
chronic GVHD from day 100 after HCT. The aim of this study
was to determine the incidence and outcomes of the various
subtypes and severities of NIH-defined chronic GVHD and their
impact on survival and NRM.
Materials and methods
Patients and trial conduct
Between June 2005 and October 2009 all consecutive patients
given an allogeneic HCT at the Medical University of Vienna,
Austria, and alive without malignant disease on day 101 after
HCT were asked to participate in this study. Patients given a
second allogeneic HCT, donor lymphocyte infusions or chemo￾therapy for a relapse after allogeneic HCT were excluded to
constitute a homogenous cohort. Patients were censored prior
to administration of donor lymphocyte infusions, post-transplant
chemotherapy and second allogeneic HCT for relapse. Patients
gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declara￾tion of Helsinki. The study had the approval of the institutional
review board of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria.
One-hundred seventy-eight patients with a median age of
40 (range, 20–65) years participated in the study and their
characteristics are shown in Table 1.
During routine follow-up visits in the Outpatient Clinic of the
BMT Unit of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, patients
were assessed for presence of chronic GVHD according to the
NIH consensus recommendations,5 including physical exams;
laboratory tests (complete blood counts and differential, liver
and renal function tests); examination by an ophthalmologist
in case of clinical complaints; gynecological examination in
case of clinical complaints and examination by a dermatologist
in case of skin manifestations among others. All patients had
pulmonary function tests prior to start of conditioning therapy
for allogeneic HCT, and starting on day 100 after HCT, every
3 months and in case of decrease of forced expiratory volume
in 1 s (FEV1) 410% as compared with the value prior to HCT,
a high-resolution CT scan of the lungs and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) with transbronchial biopsy were performed. In case
of gastrointestinal symptoms, including weight loss, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea, endoscopic examinations of the gastro￾intestinal tract by biopsies and CT scan of the abdomen were
performed.
Transplant regimens
All patients underwent HCT following standard of care or
institutional review board-approved protocols. Myeloablative
conditioning consisted in the vast majority of patients of
cyclophosphamide at 120 mg/kg and total-body irradiation of
13.2 Gy. For dose-reduced conditioning, fludarabine-containing
chemotherapy regimens were administered to 63 patients and
fludarabine in combination with total-body irradiation of 2 Gy to
five, respectively. Forty-one patients administered dose-reduced
conditioning according to the FLAMSA protocol (fludarabine,
cytarabine, amsacrine, total-body irradiation of 4 Gy and
cyclophosphamide)14 received anti-thymocyte globulin on days
3 and 2 as part of their conditioning. Ten patients with
Hodgkin’s lymphoma were administered alemtuzumab as part
of their dose-reduced conditioning regimen. Patients received a
median of 6.6 (range, 1.33–14)  106 CD34 þ cells per kg body
weight (b.w.) on day 0. Standard GVHD prophylaxis with either
cyclosporine-A and methotrexate (MTX) after myeloablative
conditioning, or cyclosporine-A with or without mycophenolate
mofetil after dose-reduced conditioning, was used. All patients
received antimicrobial and antifungal prophylaxis according
to institutional guidelines. Patients were monitored for cyto￾megalovirus reactivation by PCR assays, and were treated
preemptively with ganciclovir as described.15 After engraftment
anti-infectious prophylaxes were administered to all patients as
recommended.15

Diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic GVHD
Acute GVHD was graded weekly until day 100 after HCT
and thereafter every 2–3 weeks during routine controls in
the Outpatient Clinic by using the modified Glucksberg
criteria.16Acute GVHD was subdivided into classic acute
GVHD occurring within 100 days of HCT, persistent (defined
by features of unresolved acute GVHD beyond day 100 after
HCT), recurrent (defined as recurrence of acute GVHD after day
100) and late-onset (defined by features of acute GVHD first
observed after day 100). All patients with cutaneous manifesta￾tions of acute GVHD had skin biopsies confirming the diagnosis.
All patients with persistent nausea and/or diarrhea had endo￾scopic examinations of the gastrointestinal tract, including
biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of acute GVHD of the gut.
Only patients with elevation of bilirubin levels were assigned to
the category acute GVHD of the liver.
Treatment of acute GVHD grades II–IV consisted of methyl￾prednisolone at 2 mg/kg b.w. for a minimum of 7 days followed
by a taper every 5–7 days in responding patients. The vast majo￾rity of steroid-refractory acute GVHD patients were referred to
extracorporeal photopheresis.
Chronic GVHD was graded according to the NIH consensus
criteria and subdivided into chronic classic (defined as presence
of chronic GVHD features alone) and overlap syndrome
(defined as presence of features of both acute and chronic
GVHD).5 Patients with maculopapular rash without lichenoid
or sclerotic cutaneous manifestations and/or features of biopsy￾proven acute GVHD of the gut were assigned to the category
overlap syndrome of chronic GVHD when they had other
diagnostic signs of chronic GVHD present in addition. Only
esophageal web, strictures or stenosis in the esophagus,
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic wasting syndrome
were considered to be chronic classic GVHD of the gut. If
patients had marked elevations of transaminases with or without
cholestasis, with diagnostic signs of chronic GVHD, they were
assigned to the category chronic classic GVHD. Pulmonary
scoring of all patients was performed by using both the NIH
symptom scale as well as pulmonary function tests, starting prior
to conditioning for allogeneic HCT and repeating the tests from
day 100 after HCT every 3 months for 2 years. Severity of lung
involvement was graded according to the symptom scale and
FEV1. In close cooperation with our pulmonary specialists, all
other potential lung diseases, including infections, allergic
reactions, cardiac diseases, infectious or allergic sinusitis, were
excluded before the diagnosis of lung involvement by chronic
GVHD was established. We used the following criteria for
diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome: absence of
infection, another chronic GVHD manifestation, FEV1 below
75% predicted or decline more than 10% compared with the
value prior to HCT, and signs of obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio
below 0.7 or air trapping in high-resolution CT scan of the lung).
Quiescent onset of chronic GVHD was defined as absence
of all symptoms of acute GVHD for at least 2 weeks
and discontinuation of steroid therapy or steroid dose of
0.1–0.2 mg/kg b.w. (equaling 10–12 mg absolute dose of
methylprednisolone) during taper of steroids for acute
GVHD. Progressive onset of chronic GVHD was defined as
presentation of diagnostic signs of chronic GVHD within
2 weeks of presence of symptoms of acute GVHD or therapy
with steroids at doses above 0.5 mg/kg b.w. for treatment of
acute GVHD.
After appropriate examinations diagnosis of chronic GVHD
was established followed by assessment of severity of all
organ manifestations and global severity scoring. Assessments
for presence of chronic GVHD and its severity were repeated
every 3 months or in case of change of immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory therapy, prior to therapeutic changes.
Patients with isolated oral, ocular or mild skin involvement by
chronic GVHD were treated with topical immunosuppressants
such as topical steroids. Patients with moderate or severe
chronic GVHD received systemic immunosuppressive therapy
except four patients with moderate chronic GVHD and high risk
for relapse who were administered only topical therapies. First￾line therapy for chronic GVHD consisted of methylprednisolone
at 0.5–1 mg/kg b.w. in 20 patients, a calcineurin inhibitor
plus steroids in 53, sirolimus plus steroids in 2, topical psoralen
plus ultraviolet A irradiation plus steroids in 2, extracorporeal
photopheresis plus steroids in 1 and extracorporeal photopher￾esis plus calcineurin inhibitor plus steroids in 16, respectively.
Salvage therapy of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD patients
included extracorporeal photopheresis, mycophenolate mofetil
and other immunosuppressants.
Statistical analysis
The study was designed as a prospective cohort study inclu￾ding 178 patients who were followed longitudinally. Data
were analyzed as of 1 September 2010. Fisher’s exact test was
used to examine the significance of the association between
two variables. The events analyzed were calculated from the
time of HCT by using Kaplan–Meier estimates. NRM was
defined as any death in the absence of the underlying
malignancy. Cumulative incidence of NRM was estimated
by using the Kaplan–Meier method with adjustment for relapse
as a competing risk event. Relapse was defined as recurrence
of malignancy after achievement of complete remission or
any progression of malignant disease. OS was calculated
from day 0 of HCT to the day of death from any cause or
last follow-up. Patients were censored at the date of last
contact.
The subtype of GVHD was assessed at study entry around
day 101 after allogeneic HCT, at onset of chronic GVHD and
at peak severity. In case of transitions from late acute GVHD
to chronic GVHD, a date of onset of chronic GVHD was
assigned and the patient was considered as having chronic
GVHD thereafter. Cumulative incidences of acute and chronic
GVHD were estimated by considering relapse/progression and
death as competing risk events.17 Failure times were counted
from 100 days after HCT, whereas chronic GVHD with
onset time before 100 days was counted from the onset time.
Follow-up was censored at the time when patients underwent
donor lymphocyte infusions. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
was performed by SPSS test. SPSS version 16 (IBM Company,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analyses. Cox
proportional cause-specific hazard models were used to assess
the association of patient and transplant covariates with relapse
and NRM.
For outcome analysis, the proportional sub-distribution
hazards’ regression model of Fine and Gray17 was used. In
order to investigate the relation of relevant covariables on acute
GVHD or on chronic GVHD, univariate competing risk
regressions using NRM and relapse as competing events were
calculated. For the outcome analysis of relapse, the same
covariables were studied and competing events were NRM and
vice versa for the outcome analysis of NRM. Univariate
significant influence factors were studied in multivariate
analyses. These analyses were performed by using R 2.11.1
(using the cmprsk package). Differences were considered
statistically significant at a P-value o0.05.

Results
GVHD incidence and severity according to NIH criteria
At study entry on day 101 after HCT, 11 patients each (6.2%)
had recurrent or persistent acute GVHD. In 10 patients (5.6%)
acute GVHD was first diagnosed a median of 120 (range,
101–133) days after HCT, thus, fulfilling the criteria of late-onset
acute GVHD. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD was
63% (95% confidence interval (CI), 56–71%). For classic acute,
persistent acute, recurrent acute and late-onset acute GVHD,
the cumulative incidences were 49% (95% CI, 42–56%), 6.2%
(95% CI, 2.6–9.7%), 3.9% (95% CI, 1.1–6.7%) and 4.5%
(95% CI, 1.4–7.5%), respectively.
One hundred and fifteen of 178 patients (65%) presented
chronic GVHD a median of 152 (range, 67–490) days after
HCT (Table 2). On day 101 after HCT 55 patients had already
chronic GVHD, including 42 (76%) with chronic classic
GVHD and 13 (24%) with overlap syndrome. The median time
to onset of chronic classic GVHD was 159 (range, 99–490)
days as compared with 111 (range, 67–167) in patients with
overlap syndrome (Po0.0001). Among the 32 patients with
persistent, recurrent or late-onset acute GVHD, 20 later
transformed to chronic classic GVHD and four to overlap
syndrome.
The most frequent organ manifestations of chronic GVHD
at onset were skin (48%), mouth (39%), liver (33%) and eyes
(30%). No significant differences in organ manifestations and
severity between chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome
were observed (Table 2). Significantly more patients with
overlap syndrome had progressive onset of chronic GVHD
compared with patients with chronic classic GVHD (62% versus
7%, P ¼ 0.001). Seventeen patients (15%) had platelet counts
below 100 g/l at onset of chronic GVHD, with no significant
difference between chronic classic GVHD and overlap syn￾drome (P ¼ 0.8). Seventy-three patients (63%) had a Karnofsky
performance score of X90% at onset of chronic GVHD.
Maximum grade was reached after a median of 6 (range,
1–16) months after onset of chronic GVHD and consisted of
mild in 17 (15%), moderate in 36 (31%) and severe in 62 (54%)
patients. Most frequent peak organ manifestations were skin
in 86%, liver in 59%, oral mucosa in 59% and eyes in 58%,
respectively (Table 2). Peak severity of organ manifestations
according to global severity of chronic GVHD is shown in
Figure 1. Only 18 (16%) and 50 (43%) patients had a Karnofsky
performance score of X90 and X80% at peak severity of
chronic GVHD.
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 3 years was
64% (95% CI, 56–75%). It was 48% (95% CI, 38–56%) for
chronic classic GVHD and 16% (95% CI, 10–24%) for overlap
syndrome, respectively. In univariate competing risk regres￾sion analysis, prior acute GVHD (hazards ratio (HR) 2.76,
95% CI, 1.6–4.77, Po0.0001) was significantly associated with
increased risk of chronic GVHD, whereas use of dose-reduced
conditioning regimen (HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.34–0.82, P ¼ 0.0043)
was significantly associated with decreased risk of chronic
GVHD. Donor type and stem cell source had no significant
impact on occurrence of chronic GVHD. Of note, the CD34 þ
cell dose transplanted was not significantly different between
patients with and without chronic GVHD. Age below or equal
to 40 years was significantly associated with decreased chronic
classic GVHD (HR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.44–0.87, P ¼ 0.0124).
In univariate competing risk regression analysis, only use of
dose-reduced conditioning (HR 0.08, 95% CI, 0.01–0.57,
P ¼ 0.0119) was significantly associated with decreased risk of
overlap syndrome.

In multivariate analysis, only use of myeloablative condition￾ing was significantly associated with increased risk of chronic
GVHD (HR 1.55, 95% CI, 1.04–2.31, P ¼ 0.0317).
Overall survival
Fifty-four of 178 patients (30%) died within the median follow￾up period of 31 (range, 3–69) months including 3 with acute
GVHD, 26 without chronic GVHD, 17 with chronic classic
GVHD and 8 with overlap syndrome at study entry.
Three-year OS for the whole cohort was 72.5%. When
assigned on day 100 to either late acute (persistent acute,
recurrent acute, late-onset acute GVHD combined) GVHD
or chronic GVHD, 3-year OS for patients with late acute GVHD
and chronic GVHD were 69 and 80%, and not significantly
different, as shown in Figure 2a. Three-year survival for late￾acute GVHD, chronic classic and overlap chronic GVHD when
assigned on day 100 were 69, 83 and 73% as shown in
Figure 2b. Patients without chronic GVHD with late acute
GVHD excluded had significantly worse 3-year OS compared
with those with chronic classic GVHD with late acute GVHD
excluded (62% versus 83%, P ¼ 0.003). Of note, 3-year OS was
not significantly different for patients with chronic GVHD
present on day 100 after HCT as compared with patients with
later onset of disease (P ¼ 0.351).
When patients with late acute GVHD transitioning into
chronic GVHD at later time points than day 100 after allogeneic
HCT were assigned to the respective chronic GVHD subcate￾gory, 3-year OS for chronic classic and overlap syndrome
were 82 and 69%, and not significantly different, as shown in
Figure 2c. However, patients without chronic GVHD had
significantly worse 3-year OS compared with chronic classic
GVHD (P ¼ 0.002).
OS according to GVHD severity and other risk factors
Three-year OS for mild, moderate and severe chronic GVHD at
onset were 93%, 79% and 62.5%, and significantly different
between mild and severe (P ¼ 0.007), respectively. Three-year
OS according to maximum severity of chronic GVHD was 88,
83 and 74% for mild, moderate and severe chronic GVHD, and
thus, not significantly different, as shown in Figure 3a, when
patients with initial persistent, recurrent or late-onset acute
GVHD who later transitioned into chronic GVHD were
included in the analysis. Three-year survival according to
maximum severity of chronic GVHD was 87, 78 and 80% for
mild, moderate and severe chronic GVHD, and not significantly
different when patients with late acute (persistent acute,
recurrent acute, late-onset acute GVHD combined) GVHD
were excluded from the analysis. No significant differences
in 3-year OS according to severity of chronic GVHD were
observed between chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome
at both onset as well as peak severity. Furthermore, patients
with progressive onset type of chronic GVHD had significantly
worse 3-year survival compared with de novo (54.5% versus
89.5%, P ¼ 0.022) and quiescent type of onset (54.5% versus
84%, P ¼ 0.001) as shown in Figure 3b. Three-year OS was
also significantly worse in patients with platelet counts below
100 g/l at onset of chronic GVHD (35% versus 86%, Po0.0001)
(Figure 4). Furthermore, 3-year OS was significantly worse in
patients with a Karnofsky performance score below 90% as
compared with X90% at onset of chronic GVHD (67% versus
86%, P ¼ 0.024). Karnofsky performance score at peak severity
of chronic GVHD had no significant impact on 3-year OS
(P ¼ 0.772).

In Cox regression analysis including all patients, only
advanced disease stage prior to allogeneic HCT (P ¼ 0.025),
absence of chronic GVHD (P ¼ 0.030) and severe form of
chronic GVHD at onset (P ¼ 0.022) had a significant negative
impact on OS. When focusing on the cohort of chronic GVHD
patients, platelet counts below 100 g/l at onset of chronic
GVHD had a significantly negative impact on OS (Po0.001),
whereas other variables, including severity of chronic GVHD
at peak, history of acute GVHD, occurrence of late acute
GVHD, age, donor type, stem cell source, disease stage and
conditioning, had no significant influence on OS. Of note, no
significant differences in survival probabilities according to
main severe organ manifestations of chronic GVHD were
observed.
Non-relapse mortality
Fifty-four patients died, including 32 (59%) of relapse, 7 (13%)
of infection, 12 (22%) of GVHD and 3 (6%) of cardiovascular
failure. Two of 54 patients had late acute (1 persistent acute and
1 late-onset acute) GVHD on day 101 after allogeneic HCT and
died of acute GVHD and infection. One patient with late-onset
acute GVHD died of relapse.
NRM included 9 of 60 patients (15%) without chronic GVHD,
7 of 89 patients (8%) with chronic classic GVHD and 4 of 26
patients (15%) with overlap syndrome. According to severity at
onset of chronic GVHD, NRM affected 10 of 32 patients (31%)
with NIH severe chronic GVHD and 1 of 53 patients (2%) with
NIH moderate chronic GVHD, and was significantly different
(P ¼ 0.001). According to peak severity of chronic GVHD, all
non-relapse deaths (11 of 62, 18%) were in the patient cohort
with severe chronic GVHD. When compared with NRM of
patients with no chronic GVHD (9 of 60, 15%), no significant
difference was observed.
Three-year cumulative NRM with relapse as a competing risk
for all patients was 14% (95% CI, 8–20%). When calculated
according to the disease status on day 101 after allogeneic HCT,
3-year cumulative NRM was 11% (95% CI, 5–17%) in patients
with chronic GVHD compared with 18% (95% CI, 4–30.5%) in
patients without chronic GVHD. Three-year cumulative NRM
was 9% (95% CI, 1–17%) and 14% (95% CI, 1–29.5%) in
patients with chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome.
It was 21.5% (95% CI, 5–38%) in patients with late acute
(persistent acute, recurrent acute, late-onset acute GVHD
combined) GVHD. When patients with late acute GVHD
transitioning into chronic GVHD at later time points than day
100 after allogeneic HCT were assigned to the respective
chronic GVHD subcategory, 3-year NRM was 11% (95% CI,
5–17%) in patients with chronic GVHD compared with 19%
(95% CI, 6–32%) in patients without chronic GVHD. Further￾more, 3-year NRM was 10% (95% CI, 3–17%) and 16% (95%
CI, 1–30%) in patients with chronic classic GVHD and overlap
syndrome, respectively.
In competing risk regression analysis of all patients, advanced
disease stage prior to HCT (HR 2.46, 95% CI, 1.04–5.8,
P ¼ 0.0397) and recurrent acute GVHD (HR 4.15, 95% CI,
1.43–12.08, P ¼ 0.009) were significantly associated with
increased risk of NRM. There was a trend of increased risk
of NRM in overlap syndrome as compared with chronic classic
GVHD (HR 3.04, 95% CI, 0.93–9.99, P ¼ 0.0663). Compared
with progressive onset type, quiescent onset type had signi￾ficantly lower risk of NRM (HR 0.24, 95% CI, 0.08–0.7,
P ¼ 0.0097). NRM was also significantly higher in chronic
GVHD patients with platelet counts below 100 g/l (HR 3.05,
95% CI, 1.13–8.22, P ¼ 0.0272). Of note, history of acute

GVHD; occurrence and severity of chronic GVHD both at
onset and at peak intensity; different organ manifestations of
chronic GVHD and pre-transplant variables such as condition￾ing, donor type and stem cell source had no significant impact
on NRM.
In multivariate competing risk analysis of all patients, only
quiescent onset type was significantly associated with decreased
risk of NRM (HR 0.16, 95% CI, 0.05–0.52, P ¼ 0.0020) whereas
platelet counts below 100 g/l were significantly associated
with increased risk of NRM (HR 6.70, 95% CI, 1.50–29.87,
P ¼ 0.0126).
Relapse
Fourteen patients with chronic GVHD (12%) died of relapse,
including 4 with mild (13%), 7 with moderate (13%) and 3 with
severe (9%) chronic GVHD at onset. According to peak severity,
2 patients with mild (12%), 4 with moderate (11%) and 8 with
severe (13%) chronic GVHD died of relapse. No significant
differences between these cohorts with regard to relapse-related
deaths were observed.
The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse with NRM as a
competing risk was 19.5% (95% CI, 13–26%) for the whole
cohort. When calculated according to the disease status on day
101 after allogeneic HCT, 3-year incidence of relapse was 13%
(95% CI, 4–21%) and 14% (95% CI, 1–30%) for patients with
chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome. Of note, in
patients without chronic GVHD 3-year cumulative incidence of
relapse was 35% (95% CI, 21–48%) compared with 13% (95%
CI, 6.5–19%) in patients with chronic GVHD. Furthermore,
3-year incidence of relapse was 13% (95% CI, 1–25%) in
patients with late acute (persistent acute, recurrent acute, late￾onset acute GVHD combined) GVHD. When patients with
late acute GVHD transitioning into chronic GVHD at later time
points than day 100 after allogeneic HCT were assigned to the
respective chronic GVHD subcategory, 3-year relapse inci￾dence was 32% (95% CI, 19–45%) in patients without chronic
GVHD compared with 13% (95% CI, 6.5–19%) in patients with
chronic GVHD. Three-year relapse incidence was 12% (95%
CI, 5–19%) and 16% (95% CI, 1–30%) for patients with chronic
classic GVHD and overlap syndrome, respectively.
In competing risk regression analysis, occurrence of chronic
GVHD (HR 0.33, 95% CI, 0.17–0.66, P ¼ 0.0017), chronic
classic GVHD (HR 0.29, 95% CI, 0.13–0.67, P ¼ 0.0038),
quiescent onset type of chronic GVHD (HR 0.32, 95% CI,
0.15–0.70, P ¼ 0.0042) and late acute GVHD (persistent acute,
recurrent acute, late-onset acute GVHD combined) (HR 0.33,
95% CI, 0.11–0.96, P ¼ 0.0410) significantly decreased the risk
of relapse. Of note, disease stage had no influence on relapse.
In multivariate analysis, only presence of chronic GVHD
(HR 0.19, 95% CI, 0.08–0.45, Po0.0001) was associated with
decreased relapse rate.
Discussion
Our study of 178 patients assessed serially after allogeneic HCT
revealed a cumulative incidence of NIH-defined chronic GVHD
of 64% at 2 years. To our knowledge this is the first report on the
use of the NIH consensus criteria for the diagnosis and staging of
chronic GVHD5 in a prospective study including the distinction
between chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome, with
cumulative incidences of 38% and 12% at 3 years, respectively.
In retrospective analyses incidences of chronic classic
GVHD and overlap syndrome reportedly were 42–87% and
13–30%,8,10,11,12,18,19 with the main limitation that up to 48%
of patients originally classified as chronic GVHD according to
Seattle criteria had to be reclassified as acute GVHD when using
the NIH criteria (Table 3).8,10,11,12 Thus, our study presents for
the first time accurate incidences on the two new categories of
chronic GVHD in a cohort of consecutive patients treated at
a single institution.
Severity at onset of chronic GVHD and distribution of organ
manifestations were not significantly different between patients
with chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome. Skin, mouth,
liver and eyes were most commonly involved as has also
been reported recently by Arai et al.
20 in a prospective study
validating the NIH consensus chronic GVHD global severity
score. These investigators, however, observed higher rates of
skin (63% versus 48%), mouth (62% versus 39%), eye (51%
versus 30%), gastrointestinal (27% versus 2%), liver (50% versus
33%), joint (26% versus 1%) and genital (13% versus 1%)

manifestations of chronic GVHD at enrolment compared with
our study. Furthermore, lung involvement reportedly was 50%,
with an additional 5.7% of patients with bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome as compared with 7% of patients at onset and 18% of
patients at peak of chronic GVHD in our study. As Arai et al. do
not provide any details on how many patients’ lung involvement
was graded with the symptom scale, FEV1 or lung function
score, the assessment of chronic GVHD could have been
different in the two studies. Pulmonary scoring of all our patients
was performed by using both the NIH symptom scale as well as
FEV1 from the serial pulmonary function tests that were started
prior to conditioning for allogeneic HCT and repeated from day
100 after HCT every 3 months for 2 years. All pulmonary
function tests were performed at the same institution by using
the same reference equations used for all calculations. In close
cooperation with our pulmonary specialists, all other potential
lung diseases were excluded before the diagnosis of lung
involvement by chronic GVHD was established. Serial exam￾inations also allowed valuable comparisons and confirmed the
patients’ course. We did not use the lung function score as it
does not separate obstructive and restrictive lung manifestations,
and has not been validated yet. Furthermore, Arai et al.

enrolled only patients with an indication for systemic treatment
into their study and thus, patients with very mild chronic GVHD
who only needed topical therapy were not represented. We,
however, present all patients with chronic GVHD, including
those with mild forms. In the cohort reported by Arai et al., only
53% of cases were classified as incident (enrolment less than 3
months after chronic GVHD diagnosis), which is in contrast to
our study including all patients from the day of onset of chronic
GVHD in the analyses.
Onset of overlap syndrome as compared with chronic
classic GVHD was significantly earlier after HCT. Significantly
more patients with overlap syndrome had progressive onset of
chronic GVHD compared with patients with chronic classic
GVHD as has been reported previously in a retrospective
analysis.10
In our study, history of acute GVHD was a significant risk
factor for chronic GVHD, which is in line with previous
reports.1,21–23 Whereas other investigators observed a significant
increase in chronic GVHD after allogeneic HCT by using a
mismatched or unrelated donor,1,23,24 this was not the case in
our study. As donors were selected based on high-resolution
typing of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, C, DRB1, DRB3/
4/5 and DQB1 as reported previously,25 and only a minority of
10% of patients had an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor, our
study most likely did not have the statistical power to assess HLA
mismatching as a risk factor for chronic GVHD. In multivariate
analysis we observed a significantly lower risk for chronic
GVHD after reduced-intensity conditioning. As the majority of
patients had received anti-thymocyte globulin as part of dose￾reduced conditioning, our results confirm previous findings
on decreased rates of chronic GVHD after in vivo T-cell
depletion.23,26 Recently, Soiffer et al.
27 reported significantly
lower 3-year rates of chronic GVHD in patients administered
alemtuzumab-containing and anti-thymocyte globulin-contain￾ing regimens for reduced-intensity allogeneic HCT in 1676
adults with hematologic malignancies. Our data in a far smaller
cohort of patients are in line with these findings. Surprisingly,
in our study grafting with growth factor-mobilized blood
cells was not significantly associated with increased risk for
chronic GVHD as has been reported by others.23,28 However,
the median CD34 þ cell dose transplanted in our cohort was
below 8  106
/kg, which was reported to be the cut-off for
increased risk of developing clinical extensive chronic GVHD.29
Furthermore, Arai et al.
20 observed no association of conven￾tional risk factors for development of chronic GVHD such as
age, gender match, donor type, stem cell source or disease status
with global severity categories of chronic GVHD.
In our prospective study, the 3-year survival of patients with
chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome was 82 and 69%,
and not significantly different. Whereas Kim et al.
12 observed a
significantly different 5-year GVHD-specific survival of 87 and
70% in patients with chronic classic GVHD and overlap
syndrome, others reported no significant differences in survival
of these two new chronic GVHD entities (Table 3).9–11 Jagasia
et al.
8 observed a significantly worse 3-year survival of patients
with any features of acute GVHD, including overlap syndrome,
as compared with chronic classic GVHD. Considering inade￾quacies of medical records in documenting the presence or
absence of diagnostic and distinctive manifestations of chronic
GVHD according to the NIH consensus criteria, and differences
in historical criteria used to make the diagnosis of chronic
GVHD at various transplant centers, these retrospective analyses
have clear limitations. We confirm the worse survival of patients
with persistent, recurrent or late onset acute GVHD,8,10,11 but
observed no significantly worse survival in patients with overlap
syndrome of chronic GVHD. Our data obtained prospectively
provide the first evidence that these two new entities of chronic
GVHD have similar survival and that a distinction between late
acute GVHD and overlap syndrome is of importance for patient
outcome. Of note, recurrent acute GVHD was significantly
associated with increased risk of NRM as has been reported
previously in retrospectively reclassified patient cohorts.10,19
Furthermore, the increased NRM in patients with overlap
syndrome as compared with chronic classic GVHD has to
be interpreted cautiously as the numbers of patients affected
are small.
Three-year survival in patients with mild, moderate or severe
chronic GVHD at onset was 93, 79 and 62.5%, and significantly
different. Furthermore, no significant differences in survival
were observed when correlated with peak intensity of chronic
GVHD, which is in contrast to reports on retrospective
analyses.12,18 Perez-Simon et al.
18 observed a significantly
worse 5-year survival of 46% in patients with severe chronic
GVHD as compared with 83 and 77% in moderate and mild
chronic GVHD. We observed no significant impact of severity of
chronic GVHD at its peak intensity on NRM, confirming reports
by Jagasia et al.
8 However, it has to be kept in mind that the NIH
consensus group’s original purpose of diagnosing and staging of
chronic GVHD was to define the need for systemic treatment
and to reflect clinical effects of chronic GVHD on the patient’s
functional status, and not to predict outcomes.5 Thus, the NIH
consensus project was originally developed based on expert
opinion and retrospective data analyses as a tool to be used in
clinical trials, with the understanding that the criteria could
be revised as they underwent evaluation.5 Although patients
with chronic GVHD were treated on a routine daily basis
with immunosuppressive agents and immunomodulatory strate￾gies according to the recently published recommendations
of the German/Austrian/Swiss consensus group on chronic
GVHD,30,31 this therapeutic strategy was not a comparative
trial on therapy of chronic GVHD. Thus, any impact of severity
of chronic GVHD on transplant outcome should be investigated
in the future in therapeutic clinical studies. In addition, it has to
be considered that our prospective study was performed on
patients with newly diagnosed chronic GVHD and thus, some
patients’ characteristics could not be comparable to the ones
defining patients with long-lasting chronic GVHD in recently
published retrospective analyses. Furthermore, the lack of

association of severity of chronic GVHD with NRM could be
potentially due to the limited follow-up in our study and may be
more pronounced after a longer follow-up period. Of note, in
the two retrospective analyses revealing significantly worse OS
in patients with severe chronic GVHD compared with mild and
moderate one, median follow-up were 46 and 37 months, and
thus, longer than in our study.11,12
Most interestingly, platelet counts below 100 g/l had a
significant negative impact on survival after allogeneic HCT as
has been reported previously by investigators using the revised
Seattle criteria of chronic GVHD32–39 or reclassifying their
chronic GVHD patient cohort according to the NIH consensus
criteria.9
In our study progressive onset type of chronic GVHD was
significantly associated with worse survival and increased NRM.
Several investigators demonstrated this association in patients
with historically defined chronic GVHD32–37,40 or in patient
cohorts reclassified according to the NIH criteria.18 As persistent
acute GVHD may have many features similar to progressive
onset type of chronic GVHD, reclassification of historically
defined chronic GVHD cohorts according to the NIH criteria
can be highly problematic and most likely includes a substantial
number of patients with acute GVHD as has been reported by
several investigators.8–11,41 Thus, our prospective study provides
for the first time accurate data on the impact of progressive onset
type of NIH-defined chronic GVHD on survival and NRM after
allogeneic HCT.
We observed significantly worse 3-year survival of patients
without chronic GVHD as compared with patients with any
form of chronic GVHD both when analyzing patients according
to their GVHD status on day 100 after allogeneic HCT as well as
when transition of late acute GVHD into chronic or no chronic
GVHD was considered. This is in accordance with findings of
Jagasia et al.
8 reporting significantly worse OS of 44% in
patients without chronic GVHD compared with 60% in patients
who developed GVHD after day 100. Although the causes of
death were not significantly different compared with patients
with GVHD after day 100, in this retrospective analysis, patients
without GVHD had a significantly shorter time to death
compared with patients with GVHD after day 100.8 In our
prospective study occurrence and severity of chronic GVHD
both at onset and at peak intensity, and different organ
manifestations of chronic GVHD, had no significant influence
on NRM, whereas presence of any chronic GVHD significantly
decreased risk for relapse both in competing risk regression
analyses as well as in multivariate analysis. Recently, Inamoto
et al.
42 using the NIH consensus criteria retrospectively in 2656
patients showed that chronic GVHD was not associated with an
increased risk of early or late mortality but a reduction in risk of
relapse. Besides chronic GVHD we observed a significant
association of late acute GVHD (persistent acute, recurrent
acute, late-onset acute GVHD combined) with decreased risk of
relapse, which has also been reported by Inamoto et al.
42 in a
larger patient cohort. Other investigators reported an association
of risk of relapse with only acute GVHD43 or only chronic
GVHD.19,44 Of note, disease stage prior to HCT had no
significant impact on risk of relapse in our study. In view of
the low relapse rates and the powerful impact of any GVHD on
disease recurrence, our study most likely did not have the
statistical power to assess disease stage as a risk factor for
relapse.
Besides survival and NRM other endpoints, including side
effects and duration of systemic medications, relief of symptoms,
prevention of disability, quality of life, time to withdrawal of
systemic immunosuppressive treatment without exacerbation of
residual disease manifestations and developing immunologic
tolerance, should be important goals in the management of
chronic GVHD. Previous studies have shown a median duration
of systemic treatment for chronic GVHD of up to 3 years.1,2,35
Besides uniform criteria for diagnosis and staging of chronic
GVHD, the NIH consensus group developed documents on
chronic GVHD assessment both by clinicians as well as patients,
and chronic GVHD-nonspecific ancillary measures, including
assessments of functional impairments and quality of life.45
Although these documents represent a huge effort by the
research community, they are based on expert opinion and
have to be prospectively implemented and validated to advance
the standards and comparability of chronic GVHD research, and
hopefully thereby improving patient outcome in the near future.
Recently, Herzberg et al.
46 validated the Human Activity Profile
Questionnaire in patients after allogeneic HCT as suggested
by the NIH consensus group for measurement of physical
functioning. Currently, the Chronic GVHD Consortium in the
United States is conducting a multicenter, prospective, long￾itudinal study designed to validate and refine the recommenda￾tions of the NIH consensus conference and to provide improved
tools for clinical trials in chronic GVHD.47 Although this study
will evaluate the natural history of chronic GVHD under
currently used treatment regimens, and will evaluate prognostic
factors and surrogate endpoints for therapeutic response,
treatment is not standardized and the study is conducted during
routine clinical practice. Within the German/Austrian/Swiss
consortium on chronic GVHD we recently assessed the
usefulness of the NIH consensus criteria for patient care in
clinical practice by conducting a survey of current practices of
diagnosis, staging and overall grading of chronic GVHD, and
three meetings with participants representing 88% of all allo￾geneic HCT activities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.48
For definitions of chronic GVHD as well as overall and organ￾specific severity staging, high rates of acceptance were obtained
among the vast majority of participants. Furthermore, most
NIH recommendations were deemed to be highly suitable for
clinical routine, which is in line with our experience as this
prospective study was performed during routine patient visits in
the Outpatient Clinic of our BMT unit. Mucocutaneous
assessments, serial pulmonary function tests even in clinically
asymptomatic patients and referral to specialist consultants such
as ophthalmologists were shown to be highly suitable during
routine clinical practice and were easily performed in 3 months’
intervals. Most discussions arose in the assessment of isolated
GVHD of the liver after day 100 after HCT and its assignment to
either late acute or chronic GVHD. Most likely we will not be
able to resolve this issue with future clinical studies alone but
will need blood biomarkers or molecular studies of liver
biopsies, which we plan to perform within our consortium in
the near future.
In conclusion, this study provides for the first time prospective
data on the incidence rates of NIH-defined chronic GVHD
categories and identified risk factors for the occurrence of
chronic GVHD. Thrombocytopenia and progressive onset
type of chronic GVHD were significantly associated with
worse survival. Our findings can provide the basis for risk￾adapted strategies for treatment of NIH-defined chronic GVHD
patients.
