Pediatric heart transplantation is standard of care for children with end-stage heart failure. The diverse 
age range, diagnoses, and practice variations continue to challenge the development of evidence-based 
practices and new technologies. Outcomes in the most recent era are excellent, especially with the more 
widespread use of ventricular assist devices (VADs). Waitlist mortality remains high and knowledge of 
risk factors for death while waiting and following transplantation contributes to decision-making around 
transplant candidacy and timing of listing. The biggest gap impacting both waitlist and overall survival 
remains mechanical support options for infants and patients with single ventricle physiology. Though acute 
rejection has decreased progressively, both diagnosis and management of antibody-mediated rejection has 
become increasingly challenging and complex, as has the ability to understand the implication of anti-HLA 
antibodies detected both pre- and post-transplantation—including when and how to intervene. Trends in 
immunosuppression protocols include more use of induction therapy and steroid avoidance or withdrawal 
protocols. Common long-term morbidities include renal insufficiency, which can be mitigated with 
surveillance and renal-sparing strategies, and infections. Functional outcomes are excellent, but significant 
psychosocial challenges exist in relation to neurodevelopment, non-adherence, and transition from child￾centered to adult-centered care. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a barrier to long-term 
survival, though it is more apparent that objective evidence of an impact on the allograft is important with 
regards to impact on outcomes. Retransplantation is rare in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Pediatric 
heart transplantation continues to evolve in order to address the challenges of the diverse group of patients 
that reach end-stage heart failure during childhood.

Introduction 
Pediatric heart transplantation continues to evolve in order 
to address the challenges of the diverse group of patients 
that reach end-stage heart failure during childhood. This 
keynote article strives to address some of the contemporary 
key topics in pediatric heart transplantation. Some 
important topics are covered elsewhere in this special 
issue in more detail and the reader is encouraged to refer 
to these excellent sources for a review of indications 
for transplantation, mechanical circulatory support/
ventricular assist devices (VADs), donor selection, donation 
after cardiac death, heart retrieval and preservation, the 
transplant operation, early graft failure, and featured articles 
on neonatal transplantation, single ventricle patients, and 
adult congenital patients.
Data sources/registries and collaborations
The small numbers of pediatric patients that approach end 
stage heart failure and follow a trajectory towards heart 
transplantation continue to challenge us with regards to 
acquiring the information to develop evidence-based or best 
practices and/or to study the effect of any new diagnostic or 
therapeutic strategies on outcomes. Throughout this brief 
review of the current state of pediatric heart transplantation,

factors affecting the ability to carry out clinical and/or 
observational trials, either prospectively or retrospectively, 
in this patient population will be highlighted.
There are two main sources of multicenter data for 
children following listing for transplantation and after 
transplantation, the registry of the International Society of 
Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) (1,2), and the 
Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (3), in addition to single 
center reports and smaller collaborations. The ISHLT 
registry is an international registry where federal mandate in 
the United States requires all data from the United Network 
of Organ Sharing (UNOS) to be shared with the database, 
but is otherwise voluntary. It currently contains data on 
over 14,000 transplants in children worldwide, which is 
felt to represent three quarters of the worldwide transplant 
activity (2). The PHTS is a voluntary, research-based and 
event-driven multicenter registry that was established in 
1993 in order to capture data relative to outcomes, and 
currently includes 7,716 patients listed for transplantation, 
of which 5,586 patients underwent transplantation, between 
January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2016 from 53 centers in 
North America, the United Kingdom and Brazil.
Recipient demographics
The number of pediatric heart transplants reported to the 
ISHLT registry has increased over time with 442 in 2004, 
586 in 2014 (Figure 1) and more recently 684 in 2015 (2). 
The age distribution of the recipients has remained stable 
since the mid-1990s (Figure 2). Geographical differences 
exist worldwide. Most centers in Europe average <10 
transplants per year while centers averaging >10 per year 
make up 60% of transplants in North America; this is 
contrast to an average of 1 to 4 transplants performed by 
the majority of centers elsewhere in the world. Teenagers 
account for half of the recipients in Europe and other areas 
of the world, whereas in North America proportionately 
more infants undergo transplantation (Figure 3).
Primary diagnoses prior to transplantation have evolved 
over time. Congenital heart disease has remained the 
commonest underlying diagnosis in infants younger than 1 
year of age though the proportion of infant recipients with 
cardiomyopathy has doubled to almost 40% in the most 
recent era (Figure 4). In older patients, cardiomyopathy 
remains the predominant diagnosis (Figures 5-7). Primary 
diagnoses also show geographic variation, with congenital 
heart disease and retransplantation both more common in 
North America compared with Europe and the rest of the 
world (Figure 8) (1,2). Congenital heart disease represents 
a diverse group of diagnoses with a variety of reasons 
leading to transplantation not related to the traditional 
“congestive heart failure” paradigm thus impacting

Waitlist mortality
Mortality for children waiting for heart transplantation 
continues to be higher than for any other solid organ 
transplant (4). This is related to a combination of factors 
including availability of donor organs, the medical state 
of the recipient, recipient age, weight and diagnosis, and

appropriate timing of listing a patient for transplantation, 
and stratification of patients listed for heart transplantation.
An analysis of the US Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients (SRTR) database demonstrated that even 
though the overall 1-year mortality for all listed patients 
while waiting was 17%, waitlist mortality varied by as 
much as 10-fold based on recipient factors (5–39%) (4). 
Recipient characteristics associated with an increased 
waitlist mortality included extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) support, ventilator support, listing 
status 1A, congenital heart disease, dialysis support 
and non-white race. Waitlist mortality for infants was 
consistently higher than that of older patients, ranging 
from 25–30%, identifying the group with the most critical 
donor organ shortage. Patients with cardiomyopathy had 
better waiting list outcomes than patients with congenital 
heart disease, a group within which waitlist mortality 
varied according to underlying diagnosis and previous 
surgical palliation, especially for those patients with single 
ventricle physiology (5-7). These observations led to 
the revision of the UNOS heart waitlist stratification to 
attempt to better reflect clinical acuity and optimize the 
allocation of organs to the recipients most in need and 
less likely to survive waiting (with an acceptable transplant 
benefit). That being said, in the current era, we are still 
faced with the smallest patients, who are more likely to 
have congenital heart disease, having the greatest donor 
organ shortage and the fewest mechanical support options 
as a bridge to transplantation. This population is in 
critical need of targeted efforts to expand the donor organ 
pool, including donation after cardiac death, and develop 
miniaturized mechanical support options with variations 
amenable to use in single ventricle configurations.
Several predictive models have been developed that 
take into account multiple, coexisting clinical variables/
risk factors to estimate survival; therefore, allowing for risk 
stratification to assist in decision-making around listing 
for transplantation and allocation of donor organs to 
specific recipients to optimize survival both pre- and post￾transplant (8-11). 
Of note, in this era of more widespread availability and 
use of VADs, a recent analysis from the UNOS database has 
shown a 50% reduction in waitlist mortality with a 4 times 
higher likelihood of surviving to transplantation (12).
Mechanical support
The current state of mechanical circulatory support 
and available devices in pediatrics is covered elsewhere 
in this special issue. Multiple options exist now due to 
Figure 8 Diagnosis distribution of recipients of pediatric heart transplants by geographic location (from the registry of the International 
Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. J Heart Lung Transplant 2016;35:1185-95). CAD, coronary artery disease; CHD, coronary 
heart disease; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy.

the evolution of mechanical support options including 
temporary versus durable support and bridge to decision, 
recovery or transplant, that also allow for crossover between 
these options. The use of VADs as a bridge to transplant 
in the pediatric population has continued to increase 
significantly and currently over 50% of pediatric patients 
beyond the infant age group are transplanted from VAD 
support (2) (Figure 9). These patients can often be mobile 
and undergo physical and nutritional rehabilitation while 
awaiting transplantation, which has likely contributed to the 
reduced waitlist mortality (12,13) without compromising 
post-transplant survival (Figure 10). However, serious 
morbidity including stroke, bleeding, infection and device 
malfunction remains common (14). As depicted in Figure 
9, more infants require ECMO support, especially those 
with congenital heart disease, with the resultant suboptimal 
outcomes (13,15). Mechanical support options for single 
ventricle patients and outcomes pre- and post-transplant 
remain poor (7).
Post-transplant outcomes
The most recent analysis from the ISHLT registry shows 
a median survival of 22.3 years for those <1 year of age at 
transplantation, 18.4 years for those 1 to 5 years, 14.4 years 
for those 6 to 10 years and 13.1 years for those >11 years—
numbers that continue to improve almost annually 
(Figure 11). Remarkably, survival to 10 years in the most 
recent era conditional on survival to 1 year post-transplant 
is now 83% for all age groups <10 years at transplantation 
(1,2) (Figure 12). The diagnosis before transplantation 
also affects survival; congenital heart disease continues to 
be associated with a significantly higher early mortality 
compared to cardiomyopathy (2,7). Interestingly, the 
overall survival of cardiomyopathy patients by 3 years post￾transplant was 88% compared to 79% for patients with 
congenital heart disease but this difference was negated 
by 10 years post-transplant with 70% and 68% survival 
respectively (1) (Figure 13). Single ventricle patients with 
prior staged surgical palliation fare worse with 53% 10-year 
survival (7). Myocarditis continues to be associated with 
a worse post-transplant outcome with survival of 83% at 
1 year and 65% at 3 years post-transplant (16). Some other 
factors that have been shown to affect 1-year mortality 
include ECMO, being on a ventilator or dialysis at the time 
of transplant, other markers of renal insufficiency (creatinine 
and glomerular filtration rate), recipient body mass index, 
recipient total bilirubin, ischemic time, and transplant

center volume (2). Graft failure, rejection, infection, and 
cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) continue to be the 
major causes of death within the first 5 years post-transplant 
(Figure 14).
ABO-incompatible heart transplantation
Infants continue to experience the best long-term survival 
following pediatric heart transplantation with a median 
survival of 20.7 years (Figure 11). There is a belief that this 
is due in part to the immaturity and malleability of the 
infant immune system. This has allowed the evolution of 
ABO-incompatible heart transplantation or transplantation 
across blood groups (17). In the current era, ABO￾incompatible heart transplantation is accepted as standard 
of care—both from a waitlist mortality and a post-transplant 
survival perspective. Looking at ABO-incompatible listing 
as a strategy, failure to list for an ABO-incompatible 
graft and high clinical status emerged as the only factors 
associated with mortality (18). Multiple publications have 
now shown equivalent outcomes for ABO-incompatible 
heart transplantation, including rejection, co-morbidities, 
CAV, and graft survival (19-21). From an immune 
perspective, the observations about production of donor￾specific isohemagglutinins or lack thereof has provided 
insight and impetus for further study into mechanisms of 
B cell tolerance (22). More importantly, experience in both 
the cardiac and renal literature show that successful ABO￾incompatible transplants can be undertaken in older patients 
(and even adults), even when significant isohemagglutinins 
are present. Risk of significant rejection exists and strategies 
including plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, and 
complement inhibition (eculizumab) may be necessary in 
order to achieve a reasonable outcome (23).
Sensitization
Sensitization to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies 
depends upon the sensitivity of the testing methodology 
and is usually related to a medical intervention, especially 
blood products and homograft tissue used in congenital 
heart disease repair and VADs. In the past, in the 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) test, the serum 
was tested against a panel of different HLA donors and the 
likelihood of the serum of the potential recipient having 
HLA antibodies against a random donor was calculated 
as a percentage—the panel reactive antibody test (PRA). 
More recently, solid-phase immunoassay has superseded

transplant (from the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. J Heart Lung Transplant 2016;35:1185-95). 
CMV, cytomegalovirus.

the CDC test for the detection and characterization of 
HLA antibodies, which is a much more sensitive technique 
but has resulted in new challenges with respect to the 
interpretation of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). This test 
is able to detect HLA antibodies with a high sensitivity but 
applying this knowledge clinically has proved difficult as the 
presence of the antibody in and of itself does not mean that 
it is detrimental to the graft (24).
Donor selection/organ allocation
Sensitization in the era of solid phase assays now plays a 
key role in the decision-making around organ allocation 
and acceptance, predominantly related to the impact on 
outcomes. The PHTS registry was evaluated for outcomes 
of sensitized versus non-sensitized recipients and 1 year 
after listing, of those with a PRA of <10%, 76% were 
transplanted and 9% deceased versus 57% and 19% for 
those with a PRA ≥50%. For those that were transplanted, 
a PRA <10% had a 90% 1-year survival versus 73% with a 
PRA ≥50% (25). Waiting for a compatible donor increased 
the risk of dying on the waiting list while accepting a 
donor to which the recipient was sensitized led to a 
poorer post-transplant outcome. The requirement for a 
negative prospective crossmatch increased probability of 
death waiting but not post-transplant in an analysis of US 
listings (26). To help decide which is the best approach—
take the first organ offered or wait for the best match, a 
decision model analysis utilizing the OPTN database was 
undertaken and demonstrated that taking the first available 
organ offered provided the best outcomes overall (27).
In contrast, the ISHLT registry did not show any impact 
of an elevated PRA on overall survival (2). In a subset of 
patients in the PHTS registry with hypoplastic left heart 
syndrome and staged surgical palliation, post-transplant 
survival was not affected by sensitization, likely related to 
current management strategies (7).
Given the importance of sensitization in the current era, 
the outcomes of transplanting across a positive crossmatch 
are currently being explored in a prospective, multi￾institutional observational cohort study assessing the impact 
of pre-transplant sensitization [Clinical Trials in Organ 
Transplantation in Children (CTOTC), National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, U01AI077867] (28,29). 
Sixty percent of patients were sensitized but only 11% of 
those had a positive crossmatch. Patients with a positive 
crossmatch had a higher incidence of antibody mediated 
rejection (AMR) and acute cellular rejection (ACR) but 
there was no difference in death, retransplantation or 
rejection with hemodynamic compromise. 
Immunosuppression
With the ongoing improvement in survival following 
transplantation, there has been the need to develop 
protocols and practices to screen for and to minimize 
morbidities related to chronic immunosuppression in 
addition to promote graft longevity. There are many center￾specific protocols for maintenance immunosuppression, 
with collegial debates around the optimal regimen 
(Figure 15). One interesting observation has been the 
increase over time in induction therapy, currently used in 
71% of pediatric heart transplant recipients, but without 
impact on overall survival (1,2) (Figure 16). For the first 
time, in the most recent era, patients who have received 
induction therapy have a higher freedom from CAV in 
the ISHLT registry. A recent PHTS analysis looking at 
induction demonstrated less rejection in the induction 
group but no impact on survival on multivariate analysis 
and an attempt was made to make recommendations based 
on immunologic risk (30). There was no difference in post￾transplant lymphoproliferative disorder or CAV.
Sirolimus or everolimus use in pediatrics remains very 
low at <2% at hospital discharge but increasing to 19% 
by year 5 post-transplant (Figure 17). Use is significantly 
more common in retransplant patients (28%) compared to 
other diagnoses (8–10%) (1). A recent propensity-matched 
analysis from the PHTS registry showed sirolimus use in 
less than 10% of the patients from 2004 to 2013 with no 
difference in survival or major adverse events (31). Steroid 
use has also decreased over time with increasing adoption 
of steroid withdrawal and steroid avoidance protocols 
(Figure 18). Reported experience and outcomes remains 
variable with data from ISHLT showing a worse conditional 
1-year survival with maintenance steroid use and data from 
PHTS showing no difference in 30-day or 1-year rejection 
or graft survival with a steroid-free regimen (32). 
Increasingly being considered is the influence of genetic 
polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of different 
immunosuppressants and the potential impact on short 
and long-term outcomes. Identification of potential 
pharmacogenetic effects on outcomes could influence 
immunosuppressant choices and has been the focus of a 
number of multicenter collaborations in pediatric heart 
transplant recipients (33).

that are used for both induction and maintenance of 
immunosuppression make definitive comparisons and 
recommendations difficult, and add to the challenges with 
designing clinical trials in this patient population.
DSA post-transplant
Much still needs to be learned about the significance of 
either pre-existing or newly detected DSA (ndDSA) post￾transplant (34,35). These may be transient in which case, 
especially if early in the post-transplant course, may be of 
little significance. However, if they are persistent they are 
associated with worse graft survival (36). In the CTOTC 
trial noted above, one third of patients developed ndDSA 
in the first post-transplant year, mostly within the first 
6 weeks, implying that memory responses may 
predominate over true de novo DSA production. In the 
absence of pre-transplant DSA, patients with ndDSA 
had significantly more ACR but not AMR, and there was 
no impact on graft and patient survival in the first-year 
post-transplant (37). The more long-term impact of pre￾existing and ndDSA are being followed in this cohort 
of patient. Strategies to reduce post-transplant DSA are 
similar to those pre-transplant, however the indications, 
necessity and efficacy are as yet unknown.
Rejection
Acute rejection remains an important cause of mortality 
and morbidity after transplantation (Figure 14). The risk of 
rejection is highest in the first-year post-transplant, but data
from both the PHTS and ISHLT have shown an overall 
decline in rejection even in the first-year post-transplant 
(1,38,39) (Figure 19). This decrease significantly impacts the 
ability to use rejection as an endpoint in any study design 
or analysis. The definition of rejection varies and it is often 
difficult to differentiate ACR and AMR both clinically and 
in the published literature, further challenging risk factor 
and outcome analyses and interpretation of therapeutic 
interventions. There are few identifiable risk factors for 
rejection prior to transplantation other than sensitization. 
Both registries show that treated rejection in the first￾year post-transplant decreases long-term survival (1,40) 
(Figure 20). Myocarditis continues to be associated with 
death from acute rejection leading to the hypothesis that 
either immune or infectious mechanisms play a role in the 
suboptimal outcomes (16).
Surveillance
Endomyocardial biopsy remains the mainstay for the 
Figure 19 Percentage of pediatric heart transplant recipients experiencing treated rejection between discharge and 1-year follow-up by era 
(from the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. J Heart Lung Transplant 2016;35:1185-95).

diagnosis of rejection. There are significant differences 
in the use of routine surveillance biopsies with varying 
frequencies, centers continuing them indefinitely, others 
discontinuing them after a period of a few years, and even 
geographic variation (41). Standardized grading scales from 
ISHLT exist for biopsy reporting (42,43). For ACR, Grade 
0 R indicates no rejection, Grade 1 R mild rejection, Grade 
2 R moderate rejection, and Grade 3 R severe rejection. 
More recently, to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of AMR, 
ISHLT also developed a pathology-based AMR grading 
system (43). There have been many efforts to identify 
and validate non-invasive tests for diagnosing rejection, 
including echocardiography, intramyocardial electrography, 
and profiling of gene expression that are beyond the scope 
of this chapter (44). As yet, no non-invasive test has been 
developed to consistently and accurately diagnose and/or 
predict rejection.
Treatment
Treatment for acute rejection depends on multiple factors 
including the type, grade, time post-transplant, clinical and 
hemodynamic effect, maintenance immunosuppression and 
co-morbidities, and potential co-factors (e.g., infection, 
non-adherence, etc.). There is general agreement that mild 
rejection does not require specific intervention. Moderate 
rejection usually requires some degree of increased 
immunosuppression, which generally includes an oral 
or intravenous bolus of corticosteroid, and an increase 
in maintenance immunosuppression. There remains the 
question as to whether asymptomatic rejection found on 
routine surveillance biopsy needs to be treated at all given 
the lack of evidence for an impact on overall outcomes (45).
Antibody mediated rejection
AMR in adult recipients has been reported to be associated 
with CAV and graft failure, but there is a paucity of data in 
pediatrics. As noted above, the diagnosis of AMR is fraught 
with challenges, both clinically and from a pathologic 
perspective. This is further confounded by the evolution 
of HLA antibody detection technology and the increasing 
surveillance and detection of DSA as discussed above. 
Retrospectively assigning the ISHLT pathologic AMR 
(pAMR) grades in a single center review showed pAMR2 
or higher in 18% of biopsies and 59% of patients; pAMR3 
was associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes (46). 
Using a cohort of patients from 2010–2014 to look at AMR 
Figure 20 Kaplan-Meier survival in pediatric heart transplant recipients based on the presence of rejection within the first year after 
transplantation (conditional on survival to 1 year) (from the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. J Heart 
Lung Transplant 2016;35:1185-95).

in a more recent era, an analysis from PHTS showed an 
incidence of treated AMR of 12% in the first 3 years post￾heart transplant with risk factors including a diagnosis of 
coronary heart disease (CHD), sensitization, a positive 
crossmatch, severe ACR, and the use of maintenance 
steroids (40). Mixed rejection was seen in a total of 30% of 
patients with moderate to severe ACR by biopsy grading. 
Follow up was too short to ascertain an impact on more 
long-term outcomes. There is general agreement that AMR 
with graft dysfunction should be treated and treated AMR is 
associated with worse outcomes. Controversy exists around 
the optimal approach to asymptomatic biopsy-detected 
AMR, including whether to treat, frequency of follow up, 
and surveillance. 
Late rejection and rejection with hemodynamic 
compromise
Rejection beyond 1 year post-transplant, or late rejection, 
has also decreased over time, though with a persistent 
impact on CAV and mortality (47). Risk factors include 
early rejection, anti-HLA antibodies, older age, African￾American race, and non-adherence (39). Observations 
regarding rejection with hemodynamic compromise 
requiring inotropic support have not revealed the same era 
effect as with the other types of rejection, and worse survival 
of 49% at 5 years persists (39). Hemodynamic supports 
appropriate for the clinical presentation and aggressive 
intensification of immunosuppression is required to manage 
any rejection with hemodynamic compromise.
CAV
CAV is a leading cause of death beyond 3 years after 
transplantation (Figure 14). Risk factors for CAV in children 
include older donor age, older recipient age, donor cigarette 
use, recipient black race, transplant era, no induction 
therapy, re-transplantation, rejection in the first year post￾transplant and repeated episodes of cellular rejection (2,48). 
Freedom from CAV is 40% by 17 years post-transplant 
(Figure 21) but does vary by age (Figure 22), and is one of 
the few things that is impacted upon by induction therapy 
(Figure 23).
Diagnosis is highly dependent on the type and 
frequency of surveillance post-transplant which is 
highly variable. Coronary angiography remains the 
gold standard but has limitations and provides minimal 
information on the impact of CAV on allograft function. 
The consensus ISHLT grading system for CAV was 
developed both for purposes of standardization and to 
take into account functional parameters from invasive 
measurements or surrogate markers of hemodynamics

Intravascular ultrasound has been proposed as a better 
or complementary diagnostic tool for the detection and 
grading of CAV. Initial optimism has been tempered by 
technical issues, cost, and lack of meaningful end-points for 
management and/or prognosis. It is presently being used 
in a handful of centers on older children due to the size of 
the available catheters, and most often plays a secondary 
role (51). MRI is being trialed in a few centers but has yet 
to reach the level of replacing angiography, either from an 
imaging perspective or, more recently, microcirculation 
assessment (52). Optical coherence tomography has been 
tried in a few centers as a supplementary tool, but has not 
achieved widespread application in pediatrics (53).
Statins have been shown to play a beneficial role in 
slowing the development of CAV. Adult studies have clearly 
shown a benefit of statins on the incidence of acute rejection 
with hemodynamic compromise, improved 1-year survival, 
and reduced development of CAV. Two studies in children 
have shown a lower incidence of CAV during treatment 
with simvastatin or atorvastatin (54,55), though the PHTS 
analysis showed no impact on outcomes (56). Despite the 
paucity of pediatric data, statin use has been incorporated 
in the majority of maintenance protocols for pediatric heart 
transplant recipients.
Intervention for established CAV is challenging, 
especially in children. The limited experience and reports 
in the literature make definitive recommendations difficult 
(57-59). Due to the diffuse nature of the disease, the 
majority of patients are not amenable to interventional 
techniques. Ultimately, patients with moderate-to-severe 
CAV and evidence of graft dysfunction may require 
consideration for retransplantation.
Retransplantation
Retransplantation makes up a very small proportion of 
heart transplants in children annually (albeit with age and 
geography-related differences) (Figures 5-9); these numbers 
have decreased over time with less than 20 retransplants 
reported to the ISHLT Registry in 2014 (1). Given organ 
donor shortages and ongoing waitlist mortality, controversy 
remains regarding the role of retransplantation in light of 
the decreased long-term survival (Figure 25) and increased 
transplant-related morbidities (60,61). Retransplantation 
is a risk factor for death at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years post￾transplant (60). Survival following retransplantation nears 
that of primary transplantation only when retransplantation 
occurs at 5 years or more after primary transplantation, 
compared to shorter time intervals, and this difference 
remains significant on multivariable analysis (60)

(Figure 26). Patients retransplanted for rejection or graft 
failure, the most common reason within the first year post￾primary transplant, have a much lower survival in the first 
year following retransplantation and serious consideration 
needs to be given to the candidacy of these patients for 
retransplantation. Retransplantation for CAV has the 
highest survival but a lower freedom from CAV in the 
retransplanted heart and transplant-related morbidities

including rejection and renal dysfunction (61).
Other post-transplant complications
Late renal dysfunction continues to be a potential risk 
after heart transplantation in children with some children 
progressing to dialysis and/or renal transplant (Figure 27). 
Risk factors from PHTS include black race, rejection with 
hemodynamic compromise, and decreased glomerular 
filtration rate at 1-year post-transplant (62). Heart 
transplant programs should have protocols in place for 
proactive surveillance of renal function over time, practice 
renal-sparing strategies with all medication and therapy 
choices, encourage a minimum fluid intake daily, and 
have interventional strategies planned for mild, moderate 
and severely reduced renal function following heart 
transplantation.
Infections remain a challenge across the whole post￾transplant period. Bacterial infections, especially in the 
first month post-transplant, were the most common cause 
of severe infections with an overall mortality of 34% (63). 
Cytomegalovirus has been purported to be possibly associated 
with acute rejection, CAV and graft loss, but this was not 
born out in the PHTS analysis should no demonstrable 
association with death or CAV (64). Regarding infections, 
the type, severity, risk factors, prophylaxis, management 
strategies, and impact on outcomes vary and are beyond 
the scope of this chapter though excellent summaries and 
guidelines exist in the literature (65).
Psychosocial considerations
Functional status
The most consistent data collection regarding functional 
status is within the US using the Lansky score and reported 
to the ISHLT registry (2). A recent expanded analysis 
showed that the vast majority of children who survive at least 
1 year post-transplant have an excellent functional status with 
few limitations to daily life (66). Furthermore, children with 
intellectual disability are increasingly being considered for 
transplantation and an analysis from a similar dataset showed 
no difference in survival or acute rejection in addition to 
improvement in functional status following transplantation 
in 107 children with a diagnosis of intellectual disability, 
raising awareness of and supporting a shift in the historical 
practice of considering intellectual disability as a relative 
contraindication to transplantation (67).
Non-adherence
An awareness of and efforts to mitigate non-adherence 
Figure 27 Freedom from severe renal dysfunction by age group in pediatric heart transplant recipients (from the registry of the 
International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. J Heart Lung Transplant 2016;35:1185-95).

are a significant part of the management of pediatric heart 
transplant recipients—especially during adolescence. The 
adolescent age range itself is independently associated with 
worse survival (1), with non-adherence being linked to late 
rejection and to high rates of death in adolescents (68). The 
ability and willingness to follow medical recommendations, 
biological factors, and the normal developmental challenges 
of adolescence that affect the ability to self-monitor 
and self-care all play a role in non-adherence (68-70). 
Identification and confirmation is challenging and can strain 
the relationships between the medical team, the adolescent 
and the family. A variability in trough levels of medications 
has been shown to be a marker for recurrent rejection and 
hospitalization after transplantation, and presumably non￾adherence (71). Technologies aimed at targeting adolescents 
to help identify and manage non-adherence (including web￾based and/or medical apps) continue to be developed (72). 
A coordinated approach between the transplant team, the 
adolescent, and the family must be in place, particularly 
when transitioning from pediatric to adult-based care. 
Transition
Another area that has received tremendous attention in the 
recent past is the transition from pediatric-centered care 
to adult-centered care. Outcomes, especially rejection and 
graft loss, have been associated with a suboptimal transition 
process (73). It is clear now that transition needs to be a 
planned process that addresses the medical, psychological, 
and educational needs of adolescents and young adults with 
chronic physical and medical conditions. Also recognized 
more is the existence of a transition timeline; the process 
should be initiated with patients and families in their early 
teens and is an ongoing educational endeavor with a goal of 
providing uninterrupted health care. Focuses should include 
learning about their heart disease, medication doses and side 
effects, and signs and symptoms of infection and rejection. 
Skills to promote self-management are key and include 
learning to contact the pharmacy for medication refills, 
understanding when and how to contact the transplant 
team, practicing scheduling their own appointments and 
arranging transportation for clinic visits. Approaches to 
transition for continue to evolve, including the use of smart 
phones and other technologies (73).
Limitations
This keynote article was intended to provide a snapshot 
of the current state of pediatric heart transplantation. 
It summarizes key contemporary literature in the area. 
However, as is often the case both in transplantation 
and in pediatrics, the quality and strength of evidence is 
limited mostly to single center experiences and registry 
analyses with all of their inherent limitations. A handful 
of attempts at risk prediction models and/or decision￾making algorithms are also included but are also based 
on retrospective registry-based analyses. Prospective, 
multicenter observational and/or interventional studies are 
sorely lacking in the field, though data from the cardiac 
consortium of the NIAID/NIH-sponsored CTOTC 
program (www.ctotc.org; U01AI077867) is forthcoming 
and will provide greater strength and level of evidence for 
many of the key challenges in the field.
Conclusions
Pediatric heart transplantation is standard of care for 
children with end-stage heart failure. The diverse age 
range, diagnoses, and practice variations continue to 
challenge the development of evidence-based practices 
and new technologies. Outcomes in the most recent era 
are excellent, with the biggest gap impacting both waitlist 
and overall survival being availability of mechanical 
support options for infants and patients with single 
ventricle physiology. Functional outcomes are excellent, 
but significant psychosocial challenges exist in relation to 
neurodevelopment, non-adherence, and transition from 
child-centered to adult-centered care. Pediatric heart 
transplantation continues to evolve in order to address the 
challenges of the diverse group of patients that reach end￾stage heart failure during childhood.
