Abstract
Purpose: To evaluate the protective effects of bortezomib (Velcade) on ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in the rat retina.
Methods: The rats were randomized to receive treatment with saline, low-dose bortezomib (0.05 mg/kg), or high-dose
bortezomib (0.2 mg/kg) before the induction of IR injury. Electroretinography (ERG) was used to assess functional changes
in the retina. The expression of inflammatory mediators (iNOS, ICAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-a), anti-oxidant proteins (heme
oxygenase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin), and pro-apoptotic proteins (p53, bax) were quantified by PCR and western blot
analysis. An immunofluorescence study was performed to detect the expression of iNOS, oxidative markers (nitrotyrosine, 8-
OHdG, acrolein), NF-kB p65, and CD 68. Apoptosis of retinal cells was labeled with in situ TUNEL staining. Neu-N staining was
performed in the flat-mounted retina to evaluate the density of retinal ganglion cells.
Results: ERG showed a decreased b-wave after IR injury, and pretreatment with bortezomib, especially the high dosage,
reduced the functional impairment. Bortezomib successfully reduced the elevation of inflammatory mediators, anti-oxidant
proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins and oxidative markers after IR insult in a dose-dependent manner. In a similar fashion, NF￾kB p65- and CD 68-positive cells were decreased by bortezomib treatment. Retinal cell apoptosis in each layer was
attenuated by bortezomib. The retinal ganglion cell density was markedly decreased in the saline and low-dose bortezomib
groups but was not significantly changed in the high-dose bortezomib group.
Conclusions: Bortezomib had a neuro-protective effect in retinal IR injury, possibly by inhibiting the activation of NF-kB
related to IR insult and reducing the inflammatory signals and oxidative stress in the retina.

Introduction
Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is caused by transient disrup￾tion of blood supply in tissues followed by reperfusion. This
phenomenon contributes to various clinical problems after stroke,
myocardial infarction, shock, and organ transplantation. Emerging
evidence suggests that IR injury is also implicated in the
pathogenesis of several vision-threatening ophthalmic disorders,
such as retinal vascular occlusive disease, glaucoma and diabetic
retinopathy [1–3]. The postulated pathophysiologic mechanisms
of ischemic cell injury include depletion of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis, which
results in cell death [4]. Furthermore, the reperfusion status
aggravates the tissue insult because of released reactive oxygen
species and proinflammatory mediators, which recruit inflamma￾tory cells into tissues [5–7].
The retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) state of a rat can be
accomplished by increasing the intraocular pressure through
cannulation of the eye to interfere with retinal circulation followed
by natural reperfusion [8,9]. Electroretinography (ERG) showed a
decreased a-wave and b-wave after the ischemic event, with the b￾wave predominantly affected. Histologically, the IR model was
shown to cause apoptosis in retinal neurons and decreased
thickness in retinal cell layers, especially in the inner retinal layer
[9–11]. Consistent with TUNEL staining results for apoptotic
neurons in the inner nuclear layer, increased caspase-3 was also
observed [12]. Several inflammatory and neurodegenerative
processes in the retina have been observed in this animal model
[5]. Increased inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL￾6, IL-10, CCL-2 (MCP-1), CCL-5 (RANTES), CXCL-10, ICAM￾1, VCAM-1, and iNOS, were noted in several studies. Notably,
NF-kB is crucial for up-regulating these inflammation-associated
genes [5,11,13–16].
NF (nuclear factor)-kB, a ubiquitous transcription factor, is
involved in the expression of many genes associated with
inflammation, cell injury and stress, and it also plays an important
role in the regulation of cell survival and death. NF-kB may also
be a pivotal factor in the IR injury of organs [17–19]. Several
experimental studies have demonstrated an increased expression
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64262

of activated NF-kB after retinal IR injury [13,20,21]. NF-kB
consists of two subunits, p50 and p65 (RelA), and its activation
depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major
non-lysosomal pathway for intracellular protein degradation to
maintain several basic cellular functions, including cell cycle
progression, the stress response, and apoptosis [22–24]. Under
normal conditions, NF-kB is bound to its inhibitory factor, IkB,
and the complex is present in the cytosol. Certain stimuli, such as
inflammatory signals and oxidative stress, can trigger the
phosphorylation of IkB and lead to the ubiquitination and
degradation of IkB by the proteasome. After dissociating from
IkB, the active form of NF-kB translocates into the nucleus and
promotes the transcription of related genes [25,26].
Proteasome inhibitors have been demonstrated to be beneficial
in several pathologic conditions, including autoimmune disorders
in animal models and cancers in human [27,28]. Proteasome
inhibitors are also shown to have organ-protective effects in
experimental IR injury of the brain, heart and kidney [29–32].
Blockage of NF-kB activation is thought to account for the
majority of protective effects by proteasome inhibition. The effect
of proteasome inhibitors on retinal IR injury has never been
studied. Bortezomib (Velcade), previously known as PS-341, LDP￾341 and MLM341, is a 26S proteasome inhibitor. It is approved
by the FDA for use in the treatment of multiple myeloma [33]. We
have demonstrated that bortezomib had anti-inflammatory effects
in endotoxin-induced uveitis of rats in a previous study [34].
Concerning retinal IR injury, we hypothesized that bortezomib
could inhibit the activation of NF-kB and associated inflammatory
mediators, alleviate oxidative stress in the retina and reduce retinal
neuron death and ganglion cell apoptosis. To provide evidence for
these predictions, we designed an animal study to investigate the
effect of bortezomib on pressure-induced IR injury in the rat
retina.
Methods
Animals
We used 8-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats that weighed
200–250 g. The rats were injected with drugs or vehicle
intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to the induction of IR injury.
The rats were randomly assigned into one of four groups:
(1) The control group (sham-operated group): no drug or vehicle
was given, and the anterior chamber was penetrated by needle
without elevating the intraocular pressure;
(2) The saline group: injection of PBS before inducing retinal
ischemia;
(3) The bortezomib (L) group: injection of a low dose of
bortezomib (0.05 mg/kg; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cam￾bridge, MA) before inducing retinal ischemia; and
(4) The bortezomib (H) group: injection of a high dose of
bortezomib (0.2 mg/kg) before inducing retinal ischemia.
Total number of animals used in each group of the experiments
was summarized in Table 1. The treatment was blinded to the
experimenter.

Ethics Statement
All experiments were performed in compliance with a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
National Taiwan University and with the ARVO Statement for
the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.
Pressure-induced Ischemia-reperfusion Injury in the
Retina and Tissue Retrieval
Under deep anesthesia with zolazepam+tiletamine (Zoletil 50;
Virbac Laboratories, Carros, France) (25 mg/kg) and xylazine
(Rompun; Bayer Inc., Toronto, Canada) (5 mg/kg), the anterior
chamber of one eye in each rat was cannulated with a 30-gauge
needle connected to a saline infusion bottle, and the bottle was
elevated to a 180-cm height to achieve a 130-mmHg pressure
intraocularly. The ischemic effect was confirmed by the presence
of retinal blanching. The pressure was held for 45 minutes,
followed by removal of the needle to regain natural reperfusion of
the retina.
Some rats in each group were euthanized at 24 hours after
reperfusion by intracardiac injection of phenobarbital (25 mg/kg)
under deep anesthesia, and the remaining rats received a booster
injection of drugs or vehicles after 3 days and were sacrificed on
Day 7. The eyeballs were extracted and processed immediately for
further evaluation.
Electroretinogram (ERG)
The ERG was performed at 24 hours and 7 days after retinal
reperfusion, and the rats were kept in the dark room for 24 hours
before the examination. The rats were subjected to measurement
of ERG waves under deep anesthesia in a room with dim light
only. To normalize the data, a relative b-wave ratio indicative of
the b-wave amplitude in the normal eye compared to that in the
IR-injured eye of the same individual was calculated and used for
statistical analysis.
Semi-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Twenty-four hours after the IR injury, some rats in each group
were euthanized for determination of the expression of iNOS,
ICAM-1, MCP-1, heme oxygenase, thioredoxin, and peroxire￾doxin in the retina. Total RNA in the retina was extracted with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD). One microgram of total RNA from each sample was
annealed with 300 ng oligo (dT) (Promega, Madison, WI) for 5
minutes at 65uC and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using 80 U
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV￾RT; Invitrogen-Gibco, Grand Island, NY) per 50-mg sample for
1 hour at 37uC. The reaction was halted by increasing the
temperature to 90uC for 5 minutes. The cDNA product from each
sample was subjected to PCR with specific primers (Table 2). The
50-mL reaction mixture contained 5 mL cDNA, 1 mL sense and
antisense primers, 200 mM of each deoxynucleotide, 5 mL of 106
Taq polymerase buffer, and 1.25 U Taq polymerase (Promega).
Amplification was performed in a thermocycler (MJ Research,
Waltham, MA) with a 1-minute denaturation at 94uC and a 3-
minute extension at 72uC. The annealing temperature was
between 62uC and 42uC, and the temperature was decreased in
1uC increments, followed by 21 cycles at 55uC. Finally, the
temperature was elevated to 72uC for 10 minutes and then
reduced to 4uC. We obtained a 10-mL sample of each PCR
product to perform electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing
ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). The results were analyzed
under ultra-violet light using DNA molecular length markers. The
intensity was quantified using image analysis software (Photoshop,
ver.7.0; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), and the results were
standardized against the intensity of rat b-actin, a housekeeping
gene.
Western Blot Analysis
For the rats sacrificed at 24 hours after retinal reperfusion, total
protein was extracted from the retina by lysing the sample in
Figure 1. Evaluation of functional changes of the retina by ERG. The relative b-wave ratio was significantly decreased in the saline, low-dose
bortezomib [Vel (L)] and high-dose bortezomib [Vel (H)] groups compared with the control group, both at 24 hours and 7 days after injury. Notably,
the relative b-wave ratio in the high-dose bortezomib [Vel (H)] group was significantly higher than that in the saline and low-dose bortezomib [Vel
(L)] groups in time-matched comparisons. The data are expressed as the mean 6 SD of the mean in 6 rats for each group (bar graph). *P,0.05

radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [0.5 M Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40,
10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche
Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN)]. The extract and Laemmli
buffer were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and the mixture was boiled for 5
minutes. A 100-mg sample was separated on 10% SDS-polyacryl￾amide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The
membranes were incubated with anti-iNOS, anti-ICAM-1, anti￾TNF-a, anti-p53, anti-bax, and anti-b-actin antibodies. Then, the
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conju￾gated secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence
(GE Healthcare). The density of blots was determined using
image-analysis software after scanning the image (Photoshop,
ver.7.0; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). The optical densities of
each band were calculated and standardized based on the density
of the b-actin band.
Immunofluorescence (IF) Stain of the Retina
Twenty-four hours after IR injury of the retina, the eyeballs
were enucleated and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 M
phosphate buffer for 24 hours. After fixation, the eyes were
dehydrated with alcohol and then embedded in paraffin. The
specimens were cut into 5-mm sagittal sections near the optic nerve
head to evaluate the expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, 8-OHdG,
acrolein, NF-kB p65, and CD 68 in the retina.
After deparaffinization with xylene solutions and rehydration
with a graded series of ethanol in PBS, the tissue sections were
incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against iNOS,
nitrotyrosine, 8-OHdG, acrolein, CD 68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol￾ogy, Santa Cruz, CA) and the p65 subunit of NF-kB (Chemicon,
Figure 2. Evaluation of the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators and anti-oxidant proteins by PCR. The mRNA expression
levels of iNOS (A), ICAM-1 (B) and MCP-1 (C) were significantly higher in the saline, low-dose bortezomib [Vel (L)] and high-dose bortezomib [Vel (H)]
groups compared with normal rats. The expression of these inflammatory mediators was significantly lower in the bortezomib-pretreated groups,
especially in the high-dose group, than in the saline group. The mRNA expression levels of heme oxygenase (C), thioredoxin (D) and peroxiredoxin (E)
were significantly higher in the saline group compared with the control group. The expression of these anti-oxidant proteins was significantly lower
in the bortezomib-pretreated groups than in the saline group, and the levels of thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin did not differ significantly between the
high-dose bortezomib and control groups. The data are expressed as the mean 6 SD of the mean in 5 rats for each group (bar graph). *P,0.05

Temecula, CA) separately at 4uC. The immunoreactivity was
detected by adding a rhodamine-labeled (for CD 68) or fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled (for the others) secondary antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), and the cell nuclei were counter￾stained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Specimens
stained without the primary antibody were used as negative
controls.
In situ TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-end Labeling (TUNEL)
Assay
Retinal cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay at 24
hours after the IR injury. The retinal sections were stained using a
TUNEL-based kit (TdT FragEL; Oncogene, Darmstadt, Ger￾many) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sections
incubated with DNase I prior to the labeling procedure were used
as positive controls, and the sections stained with label solution
containing no terminal transferase were used as negative controls.
NeuN Stain in Flat-mounted Retina and Counting of
NeuN-positive Cells
The density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was evaluated by
immunofluorescence staining with NeuN 7 days after retinal
reperfusion. Briefly, the eyeballs were incised at the ora serrata and
immersion-fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 1 h, and

in the saline group compared with the control group, and expression of these oxidative markers were less prominent in the bortezomib-pretreated
groups, especially in the high-dose bortezomib group [Vel (H)]. The images represent three rats in each group. There was little variation between eyes
in the same group.

the retina tissues were extracted. The retina was cryoprotected
overnight in 30% sucrose followed by three freeze–thaw cycles and
incubated overnight with monoclonal FITC-conjugated NeuN
antibody (Chemicon, USA). Finally, the retina was flat-mounted
and viewed with a Leica TSL AOBS SP5 confocal microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA, USA).
The number of NeuN-positive cells for each retinal section was
counted in 4 selected retinal areas located at the same eccentricity
(approximately 1.5 mm from the optic disk) in the four retinal
quadrants. The cell number was quantified with image-analysis
software (Image-Pro Plus, ver.6.0; Mediacybernetic, Atlanta, GA,
USA).
Measurement of Proteasome Activity in the Retina
The chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in the rats
sacrificed at 24 hours after retinal reperfusion was determined
using commercial proteassome assay kits (Proteasome-GloTM assay
systems; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the Suc-LLVY-GloTM substrate was added to the mixture
of the Proteasome-GloTM buffer and the luciferin detection
reagent and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The
retinal tissue was minced in 100 mL of ice-cold buffer PBS
containing 5 mM EDTA followed by centrifugation at 12000 g at
4uC for 10 minutes. A 50-mL retinal sample was added by equal
volume of reagent mixture and incubated for 1.5 hours. Finally,
the luminescence of retinal sample was detected by a microplate
luminometer (Promega).

Statistical Analysis
The values are shown as the mean 6 SD. To compare the
numerical data among the four groups, Kruskal Wallis H test
followed by post hoc Dunn test was used. P,0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
The Effect of Bortezomib on Retinal Functional Change
following IR Injury
The relative b-wave ratio was approximately equal to 1 in the
normal controls. For the IR-injured rats, whether pretreated with
saline, low-dose bortezomib or high-dose bortezomib, the ratios
were all significantly decreased, both at 24 hours and 7 days after
injury (P,0.05 in all paired comparisons with normal rats).
Notably, in rats pretreated with high-dose bortezomib, the relative
b-wave ratio was higher than that in the saline and the low-dose
bortezomib groups, both at 24 hours (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002) and
7 days (P = 0.021 and P = 0.014) after the IR injury (Figure 1).
The Effect of Bortezomib on the mRNA Expression of
Inflammatory Mediators and Anti-oxidant Proteins in IR￾injured Retinas
The mRNA expression levels of iNOS, ICAM-1 and MCP-1
were significantly higher in the IR-injured rats pretreated with
saline compared with normal rats (P,0.05 in all paired
comparisons). In the IR-injured rats pretreated with low- or
high-dose bortezomib, the expression of these inflammatory
mediators was significantly lower than that in the saline group
(P,0.05 in all paired comparisons). In addition, the levels of
ICAM-1 and MCP-1 were more reduced in the high-dose
bortezomib group than in the low-dose bortezomib group
(P = 0.004 and ,0.001, respectively) (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C).
In a similar fashion, the mRNA expression levels of heme
oxygenase, thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin were significantly
higher in the saline group compared with the control group
(P,0.05 in all paired comparisons). The expression of these anti￾oxidant proteins was significantly lower in the bortezomib groups
than in the saline group (P,0.05 in all paired comparisons), and
Figure 6. IF study for evaluating CD 68-positive cells infiltrating the retina. No CD 68-positive cells were found in the control group. Some
CD 68 cells were noted in the inner retina in the saline group, as well as in the low-dose bortezomib group [Vel (L)]. However, no CD 68 cells were
found in the high-dose bortezomib group [Vel (H)]. The images represent three rats in each group. There was little variation between eyes in the
same group.

the levels of thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin did not differ
significantly between the high-dose bortezomib and control groups
(P = 0.900 and 0.970, respectively) (Figure 2D, 2E, 2F).
The Influence of Bortezomib on the Levels of
Inflammatory Mediators and Pro-apoptotic Proteins in IR￾injured Retinas
The protein levels of iNOS, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and TNF-a were
significantly higher in the IR-injured rats pretreated with saline
compared with normal rats (P,0.001 in all paired comparisons).
In the IR-injured rats pretreated with low- or high-dose
bortezomib, these inflammatory mediators were significantly lower
than in the saline group (P,0.05 in all paired comparisons). In
addition, the levels of iNOS, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 were more
reduced in the high-dose bortezomib group than in the low-dose
bortezomib group (P,0.05 in all paired comparisons) (Figure 3A,
3B, 3C and 3D).
The levels of p53 and bax were significantly higher in the saline
group compared with the control group (P,0.05 in all paired
comparisons). The expression levels of p53 and bax were lower in
the bortezomib group compared with the saline group, and the
differences were statistically significant in the high-dose bortezo￾mib group (P,0.001 in all paired comparisons) (Figure 3E and
3F).
The Effect of Bortezomib on the Expression of iNOS and
Oxidative Markers in IR-injured Retinas
IF staining revealed marked expression of iNOS in each retinal
layer in the saline group compared with the control group. In rats
pretreated with bortezomib, the expression of iNOS was less
prominent, especially in the high-dose bortezomib group
(Figure 4A).
In a similar fashion, increased expression levels of nitrotyrosine,
8-OHdG, and acrolein in the retina were noted in the saline group
compared with the control group, and the expression levels of
these oxidative markers were less pronounced in the bortezomib
groups, especially in the high-dose bortezomib group (Figure 4B,
4C and 4D).
The Inhibitory Effect of Bortezomib on NF-kB Activation
in Retinal IR Injury
Increased staining of the NF-kB p65 subunit in each layer of the
retina was noted in the saline group and low-dose bortezomib
group. In contrast, there was no significant difference in p65
expression between the high-dose bortezomib group and the
control group (Figure 5).
Bortezomib Reduced the Recruitment of CD 68 Cells in
IR-injured Retinas
Normally, nearly no CD 68-positive cells were present in the
retina. Some CD 68 cells were noted in the inner retinal tissue in
the saline group, as well as in the low-dose bortezomib group.
However, in the high-dose bortezomib group, no CD 68 cells were
found in the retinal sections (Figure 6).
The Anti-apoptotic Effect of Bortezomib on IR-injured
Retinas
Increased cell apoptosis in each retinal layer was noted in the
saline group compared with the control group by in situ TUNEL

especially in the high dosage group, the density of TUNEL￾positive cells was markedly reduced compared with rats pretreated
with saline (Figure 7).
The Influence of Bortezomib on the Density of Retinal
Ganglion Cells in IR-injured Retinas
Decreased numbers of retinal ganglion cells were noted in the
saline and the low-dose bortezomib groups compared with those in
the control group by Neu-N IF staining (P = 0.005 and 0.028,
respectively). However, there was no difference in the numbers of
retinal ganglion cells between the high-dose bortezomib group and
the control group (P = 0.989) (Figure 8).
The Effect of Bortezomib on Chymotrypsin-like Activity of
the Proteasome in IR-injured Retinas
Increased signal of luminescence, indicating increased chymo￾trypsin-like activity, in the retinal tissues was noted in the saline
group compared with the control group. The signals were
significantly lower in the bortezomib-pretreated groups than in
the saline group. There was no significance difference in the signal
of luminescence between the low-dose and the high-dose
bortezomib groups (P = 0.125) (Figure 9).
There was no mortality or extraocular morbidity associated
with the induction of IR injury or the treatment in the
experimental animals. The body weight and the number of the
red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) of the rats did
not differ significantly between the control and the treated groups
both at 24 hours and on Day 7 (Figure S1, S2).
Discussion
Our study demonstrated that pretreatment with bortezomib
could dose-dependently reduce the b-wave decrement in ERG,
and PCR and western blot analysis showed that pretreatment with
bortezomib could decrease the expression of inflammatory
mediators and production of p53 and bax. IF staining of retinal
sections revealed that bortezomib decreased tissue oxidative stress,
activation of NF-kB and recruitment of CD 68 cells resulting from
IR insult. We observed that cell apoptosis, revealed by in situ
TUNEL staining, was attenuated by bortezomib. IF staining with
Neu-N indicated that retinal ganglion cells were largely preserved
in the high-dose bortezomib group after 7 days of initiating IR
injury.
Currently, the clinical application of bortezomib is primarily in
the treatment of human hematologic diseases, such as multiple
myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and acute graft-versus-host
disease after allograft bone marrow transplantation [35,36]. Other
potential applications of bortezomib, such as the anti-inflamma￾tory effects in autoimmune diseases and the protective effects in IR
injury of brain, heart, and kidney [27–32,34,37,38], are under
investigation and currently limited to use in animal models.
Although not fully understood, the postulated mechanism of the
drug’s effect is primarily achieved through the inhibition of NF-kB
activation, which in turn reduces the transcription of inflamma￾tion-related genes and avoids the induction of inflammatory
cascades. Therefore, a proteasome inhibitor could protect target
tissues from inflammation-induced oxidative stress and cell
damage.

were significantly decreased numbers of retinal ganglion cells in the saline and the low-dose bortezomib [Vel (L)] groups but not in the high-dose

Effects of Bortezomib on IR Injury in the Retina
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64262

Whether proteasome function is altered in the process of IR
injury is still controversial. Increased proteasome activity has been
observed in an experimental study of IR injury in liver tissue, as
well as in the retina demonstrated by our study [39]. Moreover,
proteasome inhibitors theoretically normalize the proteasome
function and exert anti-inflammatory effects through the inacti￾vation of NF-kB. However, impaired proteasome function has
been found in some animal studies of IR injury in brain and heart
tissue. A plausible explanation for this impairment is the depletion
of ATP during ischemia, which inhibits the conversion of 20S to
26S proteasome. Another possibility is that the oxidative protein
and lipid products interfere with the enzyme activity of protea￾somes. Furthermore, the functional impairment of proteasomes
will lead to the intracellular accumulation of oxidative and
ubiquitinated proteins, resulting in a vicious cycle [40–42].
Paradoxically, the use of proteasome inhibitors in these animal
models has been demonstrated to lead to a tissue-protective effect,
which may be related to the time of drug administration. It has
been postulated that short-term use of proteasome inhibitors in the
acute stage of IR injury, during which the proteasome function
was only minimally affected, may be more beneficial than
persistent use of the drug in the chronic stage [32].
Our study demonstrated that the activation of NF-kB was
involved in the pathogenesis of IR injury in the retina, which was
compatible with the results of other animal studies [11,13,20,21].
In these studies, the activation of NF-kB was found to peak at 12
to 24 hours after the injury [20,21]. Furthermore, several studies
have demonstrated that the activation of NF-kB was associated
with an increased expression of inflammatory mediators, including
TNF-a, MCP-1 (CCL2), ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS, after
retinal IR injury. These studies also showed that inhibition of NF￾kB could reduce the cell damage [11,13–16,43]. Increased levels
of TNF-a were observed in the early stage of retinal ischemia and
in several neurodegenerative diseases, and TNF-a was proposed as
a pivotal cytokine mediating neuron death [44–47]. MCP-1 is an
important chemokine in attracting monocytes/macrophages to
target tissues [48]. TNF-a is one of the cytokines responsible for
up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells of blood
vessels to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration into
interstitial space [49–51]. As a result, the increase of inflammatory
cells can lead to occlusion of the capillaries in local tissue, which
further augments the ischemic insult. Further oxidative products
are generated, and severe tissue damage ensues [52]. In addition,
increased expression of iNOS in infiltrating leukocytes and inner
retinal layer occurs after retinal ischemia, and the increased
production of NO, a cytotoxic free radical, results in neural cell
death by impairing oxidative enzyme activity, leading to the
formation of oxidative products, and directly attacking DNA
[44,53–55]. Our experiment demonstrated that bortezomib could
inhibit the NF-kB activation after retinal IR injury and decrease
the expression of TNF-a, MCP-1, ICAM-1 and iNOS. Bortezo￾mib also inhibited the infiltration of CD 68 (a cell marker of
microglia/macrophages)-positive cells and decreased the expres￾sion of oxidative markers, including nitrotyrosine, 8-OHdG and
acolein, in retinal tissue. Decreased production of anti-oxidant
proteins, including heme oxygenase-1, thioredoxin, and peroxir￾edoxin, presumably occurred because the drug decreased oxida￾tive stress with less induction of these anti-oxidant proteins.
Several studies indicated that oxidative stress is one of the most
important causes of retinal neuron death after IR injury and
demonstrated that the damage can be alleviated by decreasing
oxidative stress [56–59]. Decreasing the production of free radicals
could reduce the activation of NF-kB and down-regulate the
expression of TNF-a, which is the ligand for the TNFR-1/Fas￾mediated extrinsic pathway of apoptosis [60]. In addition, the
activated NF-kB could promote cell apoptosis by up-regulating
p53 expression and interrupting the balance between bax and bcl￾xL/bcl-2 [61–64]. Therefore, inhibition of NF-kB may protect
cells from apoptosis by decreasing p53 expression. Our study
demonstrated that bortezomib could reduce the inflammation
response and oxidative stress after retinal IR injury. In addition,
the expression of p53 and bax was reduced, retinal cell apoptosis
was decreased and retinal function was preserved.
In the present study, the results showed that bortezomib had
protective effects in retinal IR injury, both anatomically and
functionally. No optimal treatment methods yet exist for several
sight-threatening ophthalmic disorders involving the mechanisms
of IR injury, and proteasome inhibition may be a potential
strategy for managing these diseases. Our study has some
limitations. First, bortezomib was administered before the
induction of ischemia to ensure the onset of the drug’s effect,
which would not happen in a clinical situation. However, the main
purpose of our study was to evaluate the drug’s effect and possible
mechanisms, so we still consider the results to be informative and
referable. Second, due to the ubiquitous distribution of protea￾somes, the systemic administration of proteasome inhibitors
inevitably causes many unwanted adverse effects. Therefore,
investigation of the heterogeneity between proteasomes in different
organs is mandatory. These differences include the composition of
subunits, protein structures, post-translational modification, and
the associating partners of proteasomes [32,65]. The designation
of organ-specific proteasome inhibitors theoretically provides
better efficacy with increased safety. In conclusion, our study
demonstrated that bortezomib successfully inhibited the activation
of NF-kB and the induction of inflammatory cascades after retinal
IR injury in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of
bortezomib also reduced the oxidative stress in tissues and exerted
protective effects on retinal tissue, both anatomically and
functionally.
