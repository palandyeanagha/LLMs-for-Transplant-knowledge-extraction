Abstract
Pseudomembranous colitis is an uncommon complication in
patients with cystic fibrosis, despite the use of multiple high-dose
antibiotic regimens and the frequency of hospital admissions. Four
patients from a total of 137 patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing
lung transplantation are described who developed fulminant
pseudomembranous colitis. Initial presentation was variable and the
mortality rate was 50% despite urgent colectomy. In one case the
presenting abdominal distension was thought to be due to
meconium ileus equivalent. It is concluded that Clostridium difficile
colitis may be a difficult diagnosis in patients with cystic fibrosis
and follows a fulminant course after lung transplantation.
