Abstract
Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths with liver metastases developing
in 25–30% of those affected. Previous data suggest a survival difference between right- and left-sided liver metastatic
CRC, even though left-sided cancer has a higher incidence of liver metastases. The aim of the study was to describe
the liver metastatic patterns and survival as a function of the characteristics of the primary tumour and different
combinations of metastatic disease.
Methods: A retrospective population-based study was performed on a cohort of patients diagnosed with CRC
in the region of Stockholm, Sweden during 2008. Patients were identified through the Swedish National Quality Registry
for Colorectal Cancer Treatment (SCRCR) and additional information on intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic pattern and
treatment were retrieved from electronic patient records. Patients were followed for 5 years or until death. Factors
influencing overall survival (OS) were investigated by means of Cox regression. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier
estimations and the log-rank test.
Results: Liver metastases were diagnosed in 272/1026 (26.5%) patients within five years of diagnosis of the primary.
Liver and lung metastases were more often diagnosed in left-sided colon cancer compared to right-sided cancer
(28.4% versus 22.1%, p = 0.029 and 19.7% versus 13.2%, p = 0.010, respectively) but the extent of liver metastases were
more extensive for right-sided cancer as compared to left-sided (p = 0.001). Liver metastatic left-sided cancer, including
rectal cancer, was associated with a 44% decreased mortality risk compared to right-sided cancer (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.
39–0.79) with a 5-year OS of 16.6% versus 4.3% (p < 0.001). In liver metastatic CRC, the presence of lung metastases did
not significantly influence OS as assessed by multivariate analysis (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.80–1.53).
Conclusion: The worse survival in liver metastatic right-sided colon cancer could possibly be explained by the higher
number of metastases, as well as more extensive segmental involvement compared with left-sided colon and rectal
cancer, even though the latter had a higher incidence of liver metastases. Detailed population-based data on the
metastatic pattern of CRC and survival could assist in more structured and individualized guidelines for follow-up of
patients with CRC.

Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer￾associated death in Western populations and the third
most frequent cause of cancer-related death in the world
[1]. Population-based studies have shown that around
25–30% of patients diagnosed with CRC develop liver
metastases during the course of their disease [2, 3]. Indi￾cations for curative-intended treatment of CRC liver
metastases (CRCLM) have expanded in recent years.
Unfortunately, despite the oncological and surgical ad￾vances made, only about 25% of patients affected are
amenable to resection, which is regarded as the only way
to achieve cure [3]. Historically, the indication for resec￾tion of liver metastases was based on tumour-related
factors, for example tumour number, size and distribu￾tion in the liver. Currently the focus is rather on the
future liver remnant (FLR), with resectability defined as
the ability to perform a complete (R0) resection, while
preserving a sufficient FLR. The presence of unresect￾able extra-hepatic disease is still considered a contraindi￾cation to liver surgery [4]. Liver resection can achieve
5-year survival rates of above 50%, compared to only
around 5% for patients treated with palliative intent [5].
Although results are not consistent, primary tumour
location in terms of right- versus left-sided cancer seems
to play a role in metastatic pattern and survival [6–9].
The observed differences in survival may depend on dif￾ferences in embryologic origin, faecal exposure of the
bowel, molecular profile, response to chemotherapy as
well as the difference in time of detection with right￾sided cancer generally presenting at a more advanced
stage [7, 10, 11]. A number of studies on differences be￾tween right- and left-sided colon cancers that only in￾cluded patients with resected stage I-III colon cancer
found no difference in survival, or even improved sur￾vival for right-sided colon cancer [12, 13]. Studies on
stage IV CRC showed a higher incidence of liver and
lung metastases in left-sided colon cancer [6, 7]. Since
right-sided metastatic cancer still implies a worse sur￾vival, it has been speculated whether the delay in diagno￾sis for right-sided cancer results in more extensive
metastatic disease at diagnosis [7]. If so, it could explain
the lower resection rate of liver metastases from right￾sided cancer reported in some studies [6, 14].
The aim of the study was to describe the liver meta￾static patterns and survival in a population-based cohort
as a function of primary tumour characteristics and dif￾ferent combinations of metastatic disease.
Methods
Study population and data collection
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm who also
deemed the need for informed consent unnecessary
according to national regulations. All patients diagnosed
with CRC in the counties of Stockholm and Gotland,
Sweden from January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2008
were identified using the Swedish National Quality
Registry for Colorectal Cancer Treatment (SCRCR). The
register has a validated coverage of over 99% [15]. In the
region, CRC is treated at 9 hospitals. Data on pre￾therapy CRC staging, time and type of surgery and histo￾pathology staging were retrieved from the registry.
Patients that during the course of follow-up developed
any metastases were identified by reviewing the clinical
records of all patients for at least five years after time of
diagnosis of the primary tumour, or until time of death.
Date of diagnosis and distribution of metastases were re￾corded in detail. It was also noted whether patients with
CRCLM were assessed by a liver multidisciplinary team
(MDT), and surgical and oncological treatment were
documented in detail.
Definition of terms
Synchronously detected metastases were defined as me￾tastases detected prior to or during resection of the pri￾mary tumour, and in the case of non-resected patients
as detected prior to or concurrently with the primary
tumour. The TNM stage of disease at diagnosis of the
primary tumour was based on histology in resected pa￾tients and on imaging in non-resected patients. Overall
survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis
of the primary tumour or date of metastatic disease to
the date of death, or to the date of censoring of live pa￾tients in January 2014. Perioperative deaths were in￾cluded in survival analyses.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were assessed by medians (inter￾quartile range) for continuous variables and categorical
variables were expressed as totals and frequencies.
Differences in medians between groups were assessed
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-normally distrib￾uted data) and the Pearson’s chi-square test was used to
test differences in proportions. Logistic regression was
used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and a 95%
confidence interval (CI) for factors predictive of surgical
resection. Variables with p < 0.10 in the univariate ana￾lysis were included in the multivariate model. Cox pro￾portional hazards regression models were performed to
determine factors that were associated with risk of death
in the overall population, and among patients with liver
metastases and presented as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI.
Variables with p < 0.15 in the univariate analysis were in￾cluded in the multivariate model. Survival probabilities
were estimated with Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank
test for testing equality of survival functions between
groups. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. STATA

Results
Demographic and clinico-pathological features
In 2008, a total of 1026 patients were diagnosed with
CRC. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years, liver me￾tastases were diagnosed in 272 patients (26.5%) of which
52.7% were male and 47.3% female (Table 1). In 166 pa￾tients (16.2%) the metastases were diagnosed synchron￾ously and in 106 (10.3%) metachronously. Males were
significantly younger than females at detection of the
primary tumour (p < 0.001) but no difference in age was
observed between those with or without liver metastases
(p = 0.397). Liver metastases were detected more often
in males than females (29.0% versus 23.7%, p = 0.054). A
higher proportion of liver metastases was seen in the
lower age categories as compared to the older age cat￾egories (p = 0.001). Liver metastases were also signifi￾cantly associated with a higher T-stage and node￾positive disease at diagnosis of the primary tumour. No
difference was seen in the incidence of liver metastases
for colon versus rectal cancer (27% versus 25%, p =
0.657). However, when categorizing tumours according
to embryologic origin, patients with left-sided cancers
(descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum) significantly
more often had liver metastases, compared to patients
with right-sided cancers (cecum, ascending colon, trans￾verse colon) (28.4% versus 22.1%, p = 0.029). Synchron￾ous or metachronous detection of liver metastases was
not influenced by embryologic or anatomical origin of
the primary cancer (Table 1). The cumulative incidence
of CRCLM as related to the time of diagnosis of the pri￾mary tumour is shown in Fig. 1a. Seventy-six percent of
all liver metastases were diagnosed within the first year,
and 89% and 93% within 2 and 3 years respectively.
Intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic pattern
At the time of diagnosis of liver metastases, 81 patients
(48.8% of those with synchronous liver metastases) had
liver-only metastases with 60 patients (36.1%) having
widespread metastases engaging all liver segments.
Twenty-two patients with metachronously detected liver
metastases had liver-only metastases of which none de￾veloped any extra-hepatic metastases during follow-up.
A single liver metastasis was detected in 55 patients
(20.2%) and 148 patients (54.4%) had four or more tu￾mours (Table 2). A higher tumour burden (number of
metastases and number of involved segments) was seen
when liver metastases were synchronously detected, as
compared with metachronous detection (Table 2).
Extra-hepatic metastases were detected in 251 patients
(24.5%). The lungs were the most common extra-hepatic
metastatic site (174 patients, 16.9%), followed by peritoneal
metastases (73 patients, 7.1%) and distant lymph node me￾tastases (49 patients, 4.8%). Within the first year after diag￾nosis of CRC, the cumulative incidence of lung metastases
was 51% and at 3 years, 84% of all lung metastases were di￾agnosed (Fig. 1b). Patients with metachronously detected
liver metastases were significantly more often diagnosed
with lung metastases (56.6% versus 44.0%, p = 0.042). Lung
metastases were more frequent in left-sided colon and rec￾tal cancer, (19.7% versus 13.2%, p = 0.010), and peritoneal
metastases were more frequent in right-sided colon cancer
(10.6% versus 5.5%, p = 0.003).
Liver metastatic patterns in patients with right-sided
versus left-sided colon and rectal cancer are shown in
Table 3. Patients with right-sided colon cancer and liver
metastases had a higher tumour burden in terms of
number of metastases and the number of segments in￾volved, compared to patients with liver metastases ori￾ginating from left-sided colon and rectal cancer.
Treatment of liver metastases
A total of 102 patients (37.5%) were referred to a liver
MDT conference and 69 of the 272 patients (25.4%) were
treated with curative intent. No patients treated outside of
a liver MDT conference had a liver resection. Recurrence
of liver metastases was diagnosed in 29 patients, corre￾sponding to a recurrence rate of 42%. Of these, 11 patients
(38%) were re-resected. Patients with metachronous de￾tection of liver metastases were more likely to undergo an
intervention with curative intent than patients with syn￾chronously detected metastases (33% versus 16.9%, p =
0.002) and major resections were less likely to be per￾formed in the latter group (p = 0.001). Patients with liver
metastatic left-sided cancer were more often resected,
compared to patients with liver metastatic right-sided can￾cer (30.8% versus 14.2%, p = 0.005). In a multivariate logis￾tic regression, the probability of undergoing a liver
resection was associated with age ≤ 68 years (OR = 2.71,
95% CI: 1.29–5.69), primary tumour-stage T-stage (T3-T4
versus T1-T2, OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.03–0.87) and number
of liver metastases (>5 versus 1–2, OR = 0.07, 95% CI:
0.03–0.19) (Table 4), while gender (OR = 0.94, 95% CI:
0.45–1.98), nodal stage of the primary (N0 versus N+, OR
= 0.72, 95% CI: 0.31–1.67), synchronous versus metachro￾nous detection (OR = 1.20, 95% CI:0.57–2.55) and primary
tumour origin (right-sided versus left-sided, OR = 1.92,
95% CI: 0.81–4.52) were not. Thirty-nine patients (56%) in
whom liver metastases were resected received pre￾operative chemotherapy. There was no statistically signifi￾cant difference in administration of palliative chemother￾apy or best supportive care (no chemotherapy) between
synchronous or metachronous detected liver metastases
(p = 0.521). Of the 251 patients with extra-hepatic metas￾tases, 30 (12%) were treated with curative intent (22 with
surgical resection and 8 with stereotactic radiotherapy).

Survival
Five-year OS for the entire CRC cohort was 56.2%.
Factors influencing OS among patients with liver metas￾tases are shown in Table 5. In the multivariate Cox
regression analysis, primary tumour location was a sig￾nificant prognostic factor for survival with better sur￾vival for left-sided colon and rectal cancer (HR = 0.56,
95% CI: 0.39–0.79). The other factors that remained
significant in the multivariate analysis were age (HR =
1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05), size of liver metastases
>50 mm (HR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.73–3.65) and liver resec￾tion (HR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.13–0.33) (Table 5). In the
stage-adjusted multivariate analysis, primary tumour site
in liver metastatic cancer remained a prognostic factor
for survival in stage III (HR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.05–0.35)
and stage IV CRC (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47–0.90) while

stage II (HR = 6.40, 95% CI: 0.62–66.00) did not
(Additional file 1: Table S1). The limited number of pa￾tients with stage I disease, and to some extent stage II dis￾ease, resulted in hazard ratio estimations with extremely
wide CI. When excluding rectal cancer from left-sided
colon cancer, site of primary tumour remained significant
in the multivariate analysis among patients with liver
metastases (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36–0.86) and non￾significant (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.81–1.28) in the univari￾able analysis of the overall population, adjusting for the
same factors as in Table 5. In liver metastatic CRC, the
presence of lung metastases did not significantly influence
OS as assessed by multivariate analysis (HR = 1.11, 95%
CI: 0.80–1.53) (Table 5).
The proportional hazards function was tested graphic￾ally and was found to be valid.
As could be expected, patients with liver metastases
had a significantly lower 5-year OS compared to patients
without liver metastases (16.9% versus 70.4%, p = 0.001).
The survival of patients with non-metastatic CRC pa￾tients and liver-only metastases, lung only metastases,
and liver and lung metastases combined are shown in
Fig. 2. Patients without any metastatic disease had a 5-
year OS of 75.1% compared to 25.2%, 45.7% and 12.7%
respectively for patients with liver-only metastases, lung
only metastases, and liver and lung metastases combined.
The 1- and 5-year survival of patients with liver metas￾tases treated with resection was 92.8% and 48.6% re￾spectively. Patients treated with palliative chemotherapy
had a 1- and 5-year survival of 58.1% and 2.2% respect￾ively, while patients receiving best supportive care (BSC)
had a 1-year survival of 8.2% and there were no 5-year
survivors (Fig. 3).
In patients with liver metastases, right-sided cancers
had a significantly worse OS compared to left-sided
colon and rectal cancers with 2-year survival rates of
14.3% and 40.3%, respectively, and 5-year survival rates
of 4.3% and 16.6%, respectively (p < 0.001), irrespective
of treatment strategy and counting from date of diagno￾sis of liver metastases (Fig. 4). When taking treatment

into account, patients with resected liver metastases
from left-sided cancers had a 5-year survival of 51.8%
while patients resected for their liver metastases origin￾ating from a right-sided tumour had a 5-year survival of
27.3% (p = 0.012) (Fig. 5). There was also a significant
survival difference between right-sided and left-sided
liver metastatic cancer if not resected (p = 0.007) (Fig. 5).
The same survival pattern, with superior survival in
left-sided cancer, was seen in patients with lung me￾tastases with 5-year survival of 13.0% versus 21.9% (p =
0.008) in right-sided compared with that of left-sided
colon and rectal cancer.
Discussion
In this study, the incidence of CRCLM was lower than
the 50% often cited in the literature, but similar to re￾sults from previously reported population-based studies
[2, 3]. Liver metastases were more often detected in the
lower age groups as compared to the older age groups,
which could possibly be attributed to a lower tendency
to perform an extensive liver work-up in the old and
frail. CRC originating from the left colon and rectum
had a higher incidence of liver metastases compared
with that of right-sided cancer. In spite of that, patients

diagnosed with liver metastases secondary to a right￾sided colon cancer had a higher T- and N-stage stage at
diagnosis. Previously published retrospective analyses
have shown the same pattern, with right-sided colon
cancer having a higher TNM stage at diagnosis [11, 16]
and lower incidences of liver metastases [6, 10]. Price et
al. speculated on whether the delay in diagnosis for
right-sided cancer could result in more extensive meta￾static disease at diagnosis, explaining the worse survival
in metastatic right-sided cancer [7]. The present study
supports this hypothesis with a higher number of metas￾tases and more liver segments involved at detection, ob￾served in patients with liver metastases from a right￾sided colon cancer. Since most other studies present the
presence of metastatic disease as a dichotomised value
(yes or no), the information regarding differences in the
actual extent of the disease is usually scant. Lung metas￾tases, typically detected a year later than liver metasta￾ses, were also significantly more often detected in
patients with left-sided colon and rectal cancer, com￾pared to patients with right-sided cancer, while periton￾eal dissemination was more often seen in right-sided
cancer. There are known molecular differences between
right- and left-sided colon cancer with the former more
often being poorly differentiated, as well as more often
KRAS and/or BRAF mutated [8, 10, 17]. RAS mutations
have been reported to be associated with a more aggres￾sive tumour biology and occur in 35–45% of all patients
with metastatic CRC [18, 19]. Among patients with re￾sectable liver metastases, the presence of RAS mutations
is 10–15% lower, indicating that the underlying biology
is prognostic and influences the likelihood of surgical re￾section [20]. Furthermore, patients with RAS mutations
undergoing liver resection have worse overall and
recurrence-free survival [20].
Since this study included reviews of abdominal im￾aging, detailed information of intrahepatic metastatic
spread can be presented. Almost one-third of all patients
with metastases in the liver had widespread disease at
diagnosis, engaging all segments. On the other hand,
nearly 50% had liver-only metastases at presentation
with metastatic disease, indicating a more pronounced
intrahepatic spread than previously reported [2, 3].
This might in part be explained by the true population￾based nature of this study, where patients were not
excluded from analysis based on treatment status of the
primary tumour.
Patients with liver metastases from a right-sided can￾cer had a significantly worse overall survival compared
to patients with liver-metastasized left-sided colon can￾cer. This is in agreement with previous reports of infer￾ior survival of right-sided colon cancer in the presence
of metastatic disease [7, 14]. Norén et al. also reported
better survival in liver metastatic left-sided CRC and fur￾ther demonstrated that the resection rate of liver metas￾tases varied according to site of the primary tumour,
with lower resection rates for right-sided cancers [6].
This was also found to be true in the present study,
where patients with liver metastatic right-sided cancer
were resected for their liver metastases less often and
had an intermediate survival as compared to patients
resected for liver metastases from a left-sided cancer and
patients not resected at all. However, tumour site was
not significantly associated with the likelihood of under￾going a resection in the multivariate logistic regression
analysis. Reasons for these survival differences are most
likely multifactorial. Patients with right-sided cancer
present later, are older at diagnosis and may have more
comorbidities than patients with left-sided cancer [11, 21].

In a study by Gervaz et al. the difference in stage could
not explain survival differences, since the survival differ￾ence was still present when adjusting for multiple factors,
including stage [11]. The stage-adjusted subgroup analysis
in this study was limited by the low number of patients in
each stage group but still, the results were similar to other
studies, with stage III and IV right-sided cancer having
significantly worse survival compared with that of left￾sided cancer [8, 12]. Stage II right-sided cancer on the
other hand is associated with better survival compared
with that of left-sided [12, 13, 22]. This might be explained
by a higher proportion of right-sided stage II cancers hav￾ing microsatellite instability, which in turn is associated
with a more favourable outcome and a decreased likeli￾hood of distant organ metastases at diagnosis [23]. In a re￾cent publication by Warschkow et al., using propensity
score analysis on patients with resected stage I-III colon
cancer, a worse survival for left-sided colon cancer was
found which contradicts the previous paradigm [13]. A
Danish population-based study challenged the right/left
categorization since no clear trend was found regarding
survival and their more detailed colon sub-site analysis re￾vealed a much more complex picture [9].
The proximal and distal colon segments are of dif￾ferent embryological origins, where the former de￾velops from the midgut and the latter from the
hindgut. Most other studies on location of colon can￾cer as a prognostic factor for survival do not include
rectal cancer. In the few studies that do, the results
are consistent with right-sided cancer having worse
survival compared with left-sided cancer [7, 10] When
analysing early stage disease, there could be merit in
not including rectal cancer in in the analyses due to
different treatment strategies, but in the setting of
metastatic disease treatment of metastases is not dif￾ferent between metastatic rectal and colon cancer.
Even when excluding rectal cancer from left-sided
colon cancer in the subgroup analysis in this study,
the findings remained comparable with primary tumour
site still being a statistically significant prognostic factor,
influencing survival.
The location of extra-hepatic disease is known to
affect survival, with lung metastases having better out￾comes [24]. The present study shows that patients with
metastases confined to the lungs did much better and
had three times longer median survival (4.3 years) com￾pared to patients with liver-only metastases. In the
multivariate analysis of factors influencing survival, the
presence of lung metastases did not significantly influ￾ence overall survival in patients with liver metastases,
nor in the overall patient population. This finding could
stimulate the debate on whether there is merit in
treating liver metastases in a subset of patients with
unresectable lung metastases. Such an approach is also
supported by data reported by Dave et al. showing a 30%
5-year survival in a cohort of patients that were planned
for liver and lung resection, but where the pulmonary
treatment was not carried out due to tumour progres￾sion after liver resection [25]. The expected 5-year
survival in these patients were much less, indicating
that resection of the liver metastases had an influence
on survival.
In the present study the referral rate to a liver
MDT was higher than the figure reported by Young
et al. where 22.5% of patients with CRCLM were re￾ferred for evaluation by a liver surgeon [26]. As a
likely consequence, the resection rate of liver metasta￾ses in this study (25.4%) were higher than the resec￾tion rate in the Young study (17%) [26], but in the
same range as other population-based studies [3]. The
5-year survival rate of 48.6% in patients resected for
liver metastases presented in this study indicates that
high survival rates can be achieved even in a
population-based setting, where referral and selection
bias could be assumed as being minimal. It is clear
that with applying current indications for curative￾intended treatment of CRCLM, not all resected pa￾tients will benefit from the procedure in terms of OS.
Conversely, some patients with liver metastases that
currently are assessed as not suitable for curative￾intended treatment might have a survival benefit from
hepatic disease-control.
A weakness of the present study is the retrospective
design where follow-up of patients could have been in￾fluenced by differences in adherence to guidelines by the
treating physicians. Some patients could have had a less
stringent follow-up because of advanced age, severe
comorbidities or early carcinomas perceived to have a
lower risk for metastasizing. Even if it is unlikely to have
affected overall survival, it could to some extent have
affected the time of detection of metastases. A major
limitation of this study is the lack of knowledge of
the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA)
classification that could potentially be a confounder
in the survival analyses. Due to the limited number of
patients in the group of metastatic right-sided colon
cancer, a proper stage-adjusted analysis could not be
conducted. This of course makes inference on survival
in these groups uncertain. Lung metastases did not
significantly influence survival in the multivariate Cox
regression analysis, but one cannot exclude immortal￾ity bias, since lung metastases were found to be diag￾nosed later in the course of the disease. Furthermore,
no information on tumour markers and mutation
status of the primary tumours was available, which
could possibly shed light on the difference in survival
seen between liver metastatic right-sided and left￾sided colon cancer.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the study offers detailed population-based
data on the metastatic pattern of CRC that could assist
in more structured and individualized guidelines for
follow-up and treatment of CRCLM. It also supports
earlier findings regarding metastatic CRC, namely that
right-sided tumours are associated with worse outcomes
compared to left-sided tumours. Moreover, data suggest
that lung metastases are not always associated with poor
survival. With increasing focus on the benefit of liver
intervention in terms of prolonged survival, there might
be a subgroup of patients that could benefit from liver
intervention, despite the presence of lung metastases not
suitable for treatment.
