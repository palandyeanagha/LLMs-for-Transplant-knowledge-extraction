Until a little over two decades ago, hypoplastic left heart
syndrome was considered an inoperable and fatal
condition, with most deaths occurring in early infancy, and
almost all of those affected dying before their first birthday.
However, the advent of surgical palliation and advances in
peri-operative care, have offered hope to these patients
and their families.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a
continuum which can affect all left sided
cardiac structures, from the mitral valve to
the aortic arch. Since Norwood’s first description
of surgical palliation in 1981,1 HLHS has been
managed either by staged palliation in the
majority of cases, or, in a minority, by primary
cardiac transplantation. In this article we will
discuss the early medical and surgical manage￾ment of the neonate with HLHS, focusing on the
evolution of new surgical strategies, and on the
changing emphasis of peri-operative circulatory
management on the intensive care unit.
INTENSIVE CARE OF THE INFANT WITH
HLHS
The primary goal of peri-operative care of the
neonate undergoing stage 1 palliation (Norwood
operation or its modifications) is to optimise
systemic oxygen delivery and organ perfusion.
This must be addressed as early as possible, and
in most cases the critical period begins before
transfer to a cardiac centre.2
PREOPERATIVE STABILISATION
The arterial duct
In the preoperative period, systemic perfusion is
critically dependent on a patent arterial duct, a
non-restrictive inter-atrial communication, and
good right ventricular function. The arterial duct
is the main source of systemic blood flow, and
provides retrograde filling to the aortic arch,
diminutive ascending aorta, and coronary
arteries. Babies with HLHS require prostaglandin
E to maintain ductal patency. This should be
commenced in the delivery room if the diagnosis
has been made prenatally, or otherwise as soon
as the diagnosis is suspected.2 Early intervention
with prostaglandin maximises systemic perfu￾sion, and optimises the condition of the infant
before surgery.
The inter-atrial communication
In contrast to the majority of HLHS patients, in
whom low systemic perfusion is in the context of
excessive pulmonary blood flow, an important
subgroup may have inadequate inter-atrial mix￾ing due to a restrictive atrial septal defect (ASD).
This results in global hypoperfusion, with pro￾found hypoxaemia and acidosis, severe pulmon￾ary venous hypertension, and overwhelming
pulmonary venous congestion on chest x ray.
These infants are generally unresponsive to
measures aimed at improving pulmonary flow
such as aggressive mechanical ventilation with
high inspired oxygen fractions or nitric oxide,
and if left untreated they rapidly develop
progressive pulmonary venous hypertension.
This is associated with increased mortality in
infants with HLHS.3 4
A restrictive ASD requires urgent intervention.
If this has been diagnosed antenatally, delivery
should be planned in a centre able to urgently
institute cardiopulmonary bypass. Decompres￾sion can be achieved by open surgical septec￾tomy, or by the transcatheter route. In a recent
series of 355 neonates with HLHS, 21 required
interventional cardiac catheterisation for crea￾tion or enlargement of restrictive or absent ASD.5
A number of transcatheter techniques have been
used. The Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy
(often unsuccessful) and blade septectomy (car￾rying a high risk of tamponade) have been more
recently superseded by techniques using trans￾atrial needle puncture followed either by serial
balloon dilatation (septoplasty) or stent implan￾tation (see fig 1).
Following relief of inter-atrial restriction, a few
days should be allowed before stage 1 palliation.
This allows for resolution of organ damage
secondary to severe hypoxia, and for improve￾ment in lung function.5
Respiratory management
All neonates with HLHS should have continuous
monitoring of their oxygen saturation. In the
preoperative setting, the systemic, pulmonary,
and coronary circulations run in parallel, and are
all supplied by the right ventricle.6 The balance
between pulmonary flow (Qp) and systemic flow
(Qs) is critically important: an excess of one will
by definition compromise the other. The balance
between pulmonary and systemic flow depends
on the relative resistances in the two circulations.
Deliberate or inadvertent manipulation of the
pulmonary resistance (primarily with changes in
respiratory management), or of the systemic
resistance (using pharmacotherapy), will result

in changes in this balance in favour of one or other circuit.
The most common early sign of pulmonary overcirculation is
an increase in arterial oxygen saturation, and seemingly
minor increases in saturation can result in significant
increases of pulmonary flow.7 If left untreated, the later,
more sinister manifestations of systemic hypoperfusion may
result; these are metabolic acidosis, diastolic hypotension,
coronary ischaemia, and myocardial and end-organ dysfunc￾tion. The sequelae of this—mesenteric ischaemia leading to
severe necrotising enterocolitis,8 and hypoxic-ischaemic or
haemorrhagic cerebral damage—can ultimately preclude
surgical intervention.
Initial respiratory care of the neonate with known or
suspected HLHS should be targeted at avoiding pulmonary
overcirculation. This pre-emptive approach is by far prefer￾able to treatment of unwanted sequelae. Pulmonary blood
flow in the neonate is exquisitely sensitive to alveolar oxygen,
carbon dioxide, and pH. Immediate management should
therefore include the routine avoidance of factors which
increase pulmonary flow (such as excessive oxygen admin￾istration or respiratory alkalosis), or with early intervention
using strategies which modestly increase pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR), and the careful introduction of systemic
vasodilators. The basic goals of respiratory management of
infants with HLHS are described in box 1. Mechanical
ventilation is not mandatory in stable infants; indeed, in a
series of 171 babies with HLHS, 30% did not require
preoperative ventilatory support.9 However, careful monitor￾ing is essential.
A number of ventilatory manipulations aimed at increasing
PVR have been described for infants with pulmonary over￾circulation, at risk of systemic hypoperfusion. Hypoxic gas
(14–20% FiO2) can be delivered by adding nitrogen to
ventilator or ambient gases.10 Arterial pCO2 can be deliber￾ately increased by hypoventilation or delivery of additional
carbon dioxide (2–5%).11 12 Deliberate hypoventilation carries
the risk of progressive atelectasis and is probably the least
favourable method. Data comparing hypoxic and hypercarbic
gas mixtures are limited. In an animal model, the ratio of
pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) responded simi￾larly to both manoeuvres.13 In the only published clinical
comparison of hypoxia (17%) and hypercarbia (FiCO2 2.7%),
10 anaesthetised infants with unoperated HLHS were
evaluated in a prospective, randomised, crossover trial.14
Both manoeuvres similarly decreased Qp:Qs and arterial
oxygen saturations. Hypercarbia, but not hypoxia, increased
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and also increased the
mixed venous and cerebral oxygen saturations, suggesting
improved systemic oxygen delivery.
Pharmacotherapy
Intravenous vasodilators are frequently used to optimise
systemic blood flow, and two main classes of agent are used
in the preoperative setting. Sodium nitroprusside is a
vasodilator with a rapid onset of action, and has the potential
advantages of a relatively titratable dose dependent effect,
and a short half life.15 Phenoxybenzamine, an a-adrenergic
receptor blocker, was shown to reduce Qp:Qs in a prospective
study of 15 patients with HLHS.16 Higher superior vena cava
saturation and a narrower arteriovenous oxygen difference
were noted, indicating improved systemic oxygen delivery
with phenoxybenzamine. In another study, the use of peri￾operative phenoxybenzamine was associated with increased
survival.17 Systemic vasodilators should be used carefully in
order to avoid excessive hypotension, which can to an extent
be avoided if the intravascular volume status is adequate.
However, systemic blood pressure is a poor marker of
systemic blood flow. A lower mean arterial pressure in the
infant who is systemically vasodilated is preferable to
hypertension with systemic vasoconstriction.
Inotropes are not specifically indicated in the preoperative
setting, but may be beneficial in some individuals. Infants
with severe metabolic acidosis at presentation, and those
with coronary ischaemia secondary to hypoperfusion are at
particular risk of right ventricular dysfunction. In this
situation, a low dose infusion of an inotrope such as
dobutamine (5–10 mg/kg/min) may improve ventricular
function.
Prenatal diagnosis
Prenatal diagnosis has allowed for more careful planning of
delivery and immediate postnatal care of infants with HLHS.

survival is variable, infants diagnosed prenatally are certainly
less likely to experience the sequelae of pulmonary over￾circulation or acidosis. Prenatal diagnosis is associated with
improved neurological outcome18 and with a lower incidence
of preoperative acidosis and ventricular dysfunction, and the
need for less inotropic support.19 For the minority with a
restrictive ASD, prenatal diagnosis allows for immediate
postnatal intervention. These data undoubtedly reinforce the
importance of early pre-emptive intensive care of neonates
with HLHS.
SURGERY FOR HLHS
Staged surgical palliation begins with the Norwood opera￾tion,1 or one of its modifications, typically performed during
the first week of life. The aim of stage 1 palliation is to
enlarge the aorta and to establish its continuity with the right
ventricle; to provide free mixing of the pulmonary and
systemic venous blood through an atrial septectomy; and to
provide the lungs with flow through a systemic-to-pulmonary
artery modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt, or latterly via a
conduit between the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries.
Right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit: a recent
modification of stage 1 palliation (fig 2)
Survival of infants born with HLHS has steadily improved
since the first description of staged palliation by Norwood
and colleagues. Historically, the use of an RV-PA conduit as
the source of pulmonary flow had been abandoned in the
early 1980s, due to high mortality. However, in retrospect this
outcome was probably related to the generous diameter of
the conduits (8 mm or more), resulting in massive pulmon￾ary flow and systemic hypoperfusion, rather than the concept
itself.
Recently, this approach has been revived, using smaller
(4–6 mm) and therefore more limiting conduits, with
encouraging results.20 21 The so-called ‘‘Sano’’ modification
has become increasingly popular in major institutions around
the world. Though still early in its evolution, the over￾whelming impression from major centres is that the early
postoperative course of infants with a conduit is smoother
than for those with a BT shunt.13 22 23 A prospective
randomised comparison of the two surgical techniques may
never be feasible, but a number of retrospective cohort
comparisons have now been published. While recognising
their limitations in design and size, and relatively short
follow up period, results have been remarkably uniform, and
encouragingly in favour of the use of a conduit rather than a
shunt.
Systemic perfusion and diastolic blood pressure are
generally better maintained after the conduit procedure,
and active manipulation of pulmonary blood flow (beyond
standard measures) is rarely necessary.21 An important
advantage of the conduit over the shunt is the maintenance
of diastolic coronary perfusion, avoiding the ‘‘run-off’’ which
can potentiate myocardial ischaemia in the latter group. This
is supported by a number of observational studies which have
reported a higher diastolic pressure in patients with a
conduit;21 23–25 and echocardiographic data showing that
infants with conduit palliation have no diastolic flow reversal
in the aortic arch, in contrast to those with a BT shunt. We
have recently shown that these encouraging early signs may
be translated into improved right ventricular performance in
the convalescent phase.26
Clearly, as with any new technique where long term results
are not yet available, one must be cautious in over￾interpreting the current data. Indeed, there are theoretical
concerns regarding the long term implications of a right
ventriculotomy in the conduit modification. However,
right ventricular failure or arrhythmias have failed to
materialise so far. Furthermore, our tissue Doppler data,26
catheterisation data of others,25 and increased survival to
stage 2 palliation23 would all suggest improved, rather than
diminished right ventricular function in patients with a
conduit.
POSTOPERATIVE INTENSIVE CARE AFTER STAGE 1
PALLIATION
Stage 1 palliation, whether with a classical Norwood
operation or with the conduit modification, is a complex
procedure, which imposes profound physiological changes on
a precarious substrate. Some infants have been in a sub￾optimal condition preoperatively, and all are subjected to a
long period of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross￾clamp, with deep hypothermia and, in the majority of
patients, a period of circulatory arrest. The early postoperative
period therefore imposes on these infants the major,
immediate demands of adapting to a new circulation, while
recovering from a long open heart procedure.
Again, the key to the intensive care of infants after stage 1
palliation is to optimise systemic oxygen delivery, and to act
early on any disturbances of this. This is achieved with the
combination of careful monitoring, avoidance of factors
which lead to excessive pulmonary flow, maintenance of
haemoglobin level, optimisation of ventricular performance,
and systemic afterload reduction. Historically, early post￾operative care of the Norwood patient focused on ventilatory
manipulation of PVR to limit pulmonary blood flow. This
often subjected the infants to a degree of acidosis which we
now recognise as being undesirable. Over recent years,
smaller and more limiting BT shunts, the advent of the
conduit, and the more routine and liberal use of systemic
vasodilators, have somewhat obviated the need for such
aggressive control of PVR while appropriately optimising
systemic perfusion.
Haemoglobin
The important contribution of haemoglobin to systemic
oxygen delivery should not be underestimated. In the
hypoplast, where systemic saturation is kept relatively low,
haemoglobin should be maintained around 140–160 g/l to
maximise tissue oxygenation.

Monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation
The adequacy of systemic oxygen delivery, which is so
critical, and so variable, is paradoxically difficult to assess. An
increasing or persistent metabolic acidosis, or an increased
serum lactate, may simply confirm that perfusion is under
threat or already compromised. Furthermore, these para￾meters are not continuously monitored, and therefore give
only periodic information. Mixed venous oxygen saturation
provides a useful, continuous surrogate measure of the
efficiency of systemic oxygen delivery in the functionally
univentricular circulation,27 and can be used to guide therapy
with systemic vasodilators.16 17
In the infant after stage 1 palliation, mixed venous
saturation can be continuously monitored using a co￾oximeter placed directly into the SVC at the time of surgery.28
Although the absolute numbers obtained by this method
are not always accurate, the trend in data generated by a
well positioned co-oximeter can be useful, with subtle
changes often preceding changes in other haemodynamic
parameters. A falling saturation would suggest increased
tissue oxygen extraction, towards the anaerobic threshold,29
and most importantly should stimulate us to search for a
cause.17
Ventricular performance
Systemic oxygen delivery after stage 1 palliation can be
compromised by two components of right ventricular
performance: impaired contractility, and tricuspid regurgita￾tion. Impaired systolic function is an inevitable consequence
of bypass related myocardial injury, and can be exacerbated
by coronary ischaemia. Ventricular contractility and compe￾tence of the tricuspid valve should be assessed using
echocardiography. Right ventricular performance can then
be optimised with inotropic therapy and appropriate after￾load reduction using vasodilators, while avoiding factors
which may result in excessive pulmonary blood flow and
reduced coronary perfusion.
Pharmacotherapy
Most patients after stage 1 palliation require inotropes to
maintain cardiac contractility. Dobutamine and dopamine
are both appropriate for this role, though the additional
vasodilatation afforded by dobutamine would make this the
drug of choice in some centres. Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibi￾tors such as milrinone are ‘‘inodilators’’, which improve
systemic oxygen delivery by producing a combination of
inotropic and vasodilatory effects. Milrinone has recently
been shown to prevent the development of a low cardiac
output state in selected children after cardiac surgery,30 and is
being increasingly used in infants early after stage 1
palliation. The use of pure systemic vasodilators in addition
to inotropes, in the palliated circulation has a number of
desirable effects. Peripheral vasodilatation results in afterload
reduction, and improved cardiac output and systemic
perfusion, and reduces tricuspid regurgitation. Many centres
now routinely use phenoxybenzamine intra-operatively and
postoperatively after stage 1 palliation, and there is some
evidence to suggest that this, in combination with other
advancements in peri-operative management, results in
improved systemic oxygen delivery, and improves out￾come.16 17 28 31 Interestingly, higher levels of arterial oxygen
are much better tolerated, and may even improve systemic
oxygen delivery in the presence of aggressive afterload
reduction.32 33 In our institution, intravenous dilators are
commenced in the operating room or early after surgery
in the majority of patients; and once enteral feeds have
been established, an oral vasodilator such as captopril is
introduced.
Ventilation
All infants require mechanical ventilation postoperatively,
and initial target blood gases are in general similar to those
preoperatively—with a normal pH and CO2, and an arterial
PO2 of less than 40 mm Hg. The pulmonary vasculature after
surgery is often labile, and factors which may give rise to
unwanted increases in pulmonary blood flow, such as
hyperventilation, should be routinely avoided. If however,
despite all of the above measures, there is persisting
oversaturation with evidence of inadequate systemic oxygen
delivery, then the addition of nitrogen to give hypoxic
inspiratory gas mixtures can be considered. There is little, if
any evidence to show that this manoeuvre has any more than
a cosmetic effect—in other words, hypoxic gas effectively
reduces the arterial oxygenation, without any convincing
effect on systemic oxygen delivery.
Extracorporeal life support
Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been used to support
many children with refractory cardiopulmonary dysfunction
after surgery for congenital heart disease, with a hospital
survival of around 40%. Historically, the survival for the
subgroup requiring ECLS after stage 1 palliation for HLHS
has been much lower, at less than 30%. In fact many centres,
until very recently, considered HLHS to be a relative contra￾indication for ECLS. However, it is becoming increasingly
recognised that the period of myocardial ‘‘rest’’, and optimal
systemic perfusion afforded by ECLS may have advantages
over high dose inotrope therapy in borderline patients. In
some centres this approach is becoming much more routine,
with very encouraging outcomes.34 Therefore, although
carrying a significant risk, ECLS can, if initiated promptly,
improve the outcome in infants with impaired cardiopul￾monary function after stage 1 palliation.35
Vascular access
Most infants require central venous access in the first days or
weeks after stage 1 palliation, for drug delivery, and in some
cases for parenteral nutrition. Line related venous thrombosis
is a well recognised complication of central venous catheters,
and this can have disastrous consequences in infants with
HLHS. In particular, thrombosis of the superior caval vein can
preclude any further surgery. Many units have now moved
away from using internal jugular central venous catheters, in
favour of direct atrial lines. Although there is little evidence
base in the current literature, it would be worth considering
the routine use of low dose intravenous heparin in infants
with HLHS who have central venous lines.
INTERSTAGE MORTALITY
This term refers to deaths occurring after hospital discharge
and prior to stage 2 palliation, the bi-directional cavopul￾monary shunt. Most institutions quote an interstage mortal￾ity of 10–15%,9 36 though early data would suggest that this
figure may be lower with the conduit modification.25
Most interstage deaths are sudden and apparently unpre￾dictable. Infants after stage 1 palliation require close and
regular monitoring, with regular medical review. Ghanayem
et al reported a reduction of interstage mortality from 16% to
0% in 81 consecutive infants with HLHS, following the
introduction of systematic daily monitoring following dis￾charge:37 parents maintained a log of daily weight and
saturations. Oxygen saturations below 70% and/or failure to
gain at least 20 g weight within three days triggered review
by a physician. In our institution, all infants have weekly
echos, and remain hospitalised, or in hospital accommoda￾tion until stage 2 palliation.
Stage 2 palliation is associated with very low mortality, and
following this procedure patients show improved growth,
and are low risk candidates for their Fontan completion

(stage 3). A recent review of a cohort of 332 patients did not
identify HLHS as an independent risk factor for mortality
after the Fontan operation.38
TRANSPLANTATION
In some centres, the option of heart transplantation in early
infancy is offered as an alternative to stage 1 palliation.
Centres routinely performing transplantation have previously
reported impressive early survival figures which would favour
this option over stage 1 palliation.39 For the single reason of
limited donor organ supply, primary transplantation is not a
realistic option in most institutions outside North America.
Transplantation is not an easy option. Most infants
awaiting transplantation require long term therapy with
prostaglandin, may need repeated septal decompressions,
and potentially other extracardiac procedures. Also, trans￾plantation introduces a new set of considerations: the need
for lifelong immune suppression, the accelerated onset of
coronary artery disease, and the unknown question of the
long term viability of a neonatal donor heart. Moreover, with
improving survival rates for staged palliation, the relative
benefits of heart transplantation have narrowed over the past
decade. Thus, a study from the USA, of 2264 infants
diagnosed with HLHS, showed a reduction in the proportion
being transplanted during the past decade.40
CONCLUSION
Survival of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome has
improved dramatically over the past 20 years, with many
centres now quoting a survival after stage 1 palliation of over
80%.9 17 19 34 However, mortality for these infants remains
higher than for other congenital heart defects requiring
surgical intervention in the neonatal period. Three main
reasons for this have been identified: preoperative instability,
mainly caused by inadequate systemic oxygen delivery;
mortality following stage 1 palliation; and out-of-hospital
mortality whilst waiting for stage 2 palliation. In this article,
we have emphasised the need to optimise systemic perfusion
in the peri-operative period, the particular challenge caused
by a restrictive ASD, and the benefits of prenatal diagnosis
and early optimisation of medical management. We have also
highlighted recent advances in the surgical technique of stage
1 palliation by using a right ventricle to pulmonary artery
conduit, the role of heart transplantation, and the use of
ECLS.
All in all, over recent years, the refinement of surgical
techniques, with pre-emptive management and improved
intensive and convalescent care, have dramatically changed
the outlook for infants with HLHS and their families.

Congenital absence of the left sternomastoid muscle
T
his baby was brought to medical atten￾tion at 1 hour of age. The birth was a
normal spontaneous vaginal delivery,
after an uneventful pregnancy. Examina￾tion revealed an absent left sternomastoid
muscle with paradoxical movement of the
soft tissues in the left supraclavicular space.
This was more pronounced on crying, as
illustrated in figs 1 and 2. The rest of the
clinical examination was unremarkable. The
swelling seen superior to the clavicle was
confirmed as being the herniating apex of
the left lung.
A literature search found only one paper1
that describes a similar infant.
