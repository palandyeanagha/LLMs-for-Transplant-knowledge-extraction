Summary
The distance covered in 12 minutes' walking was used to
test exercise tolerance in chronic bronchitis. The distance
covered bore a poor relation to the forced expiratory
volume in 1 second but a significant relation to the
forced vital capacity and the maximum oxygen consump￾tion and ventilation on a bicycle ergometer. The test may
be a simple practical guide to everyday disability in
chronic bronchitis.
Introduction
Clinicians commonly judge exercise tolerance in patients with
chronic bronchitis on the basis of the clinical history and simple
spirometric tests.1 Exercise testing in a laboratory is less
common.2 We have investigated a simple practical test-a
measurement of the distance covered in 12 minutes' walking￾as a further estimate of exercise tolerance.
A 12-minute test was originally described by Cooper3 as a
guide to physical fitness. He found a close relation in healthy
young men between the distance covered in 12 minutes' running
and the maximum oxygen uptake measured on a treadmill and
subsequently published tables relating to oxygen consumption,
fitness, and 12-minute distance in both sexes over a range of
ages.4 We describe here our initial experience of a test of this
kind in chronic bronchitis, compare the results with other indices
of respiratory function, and attempt to evaluate the test as a
guide to respiratory disability.
Methods
The test was carried out in a level enclosed hospital corridor. Each
patient was instructed to cover as much ground as he could on foot
in 12 minutes. He was told to keep going continuously if possible but
not to be concerned if he had to slow down or stop to rest. His aim was
to feel at the end of the test that he could not have covered more
ground in the time. A doctor accompanied the subject, acting as
timekeeper and giving encouragement as necessary.
Other tests-Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and
forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured on a low-resistance
spirometer,5 the best of three readings being taken.6 Progressive
exercise testing was performed on an electrically braked bicycle
ergometer (Elema). The work load was initially 17 W (100 kpm/min)
for two minutes, increasing thereafter by 17 W (100 kpm/min) each
minute. Expired gas was collected in a Tissot spirometer during the
last half minute of each work load and was analysed for oxygen and
carbon dioxide. The values of oxygen uptake and ventilation during
the second half minute of the greatest work load which the subject
could maintain for one minute were designated Vo2 (ex) and VE (ex).
Patients and procedure-The 35 subjects were men aged 40 to 70
years with chronic bronchitis according to the criteria laid down by the
Medical Research Council. Their mean FEV, (± SD) was 105 +
0 58 litres and mean FVC 2 84 + 0 93 litres at body temperature and
pressure, saturated (BTPS). They were tested on at least two days,
which were not necessarily consecutive. The order of the tests was
always: spirometry, the 12-minute test, and, after a rest of about
20 minutes, the progressive exercise test. The progressive exercise
test was performed by only 29 subjects.
Results
The reproducibility of the 12-minute test was investigated in 12
hospital inpatients who performed it three times on different days.
The 12-minute distances ranged from 238 metres to 1463 metres, and
the mean distances (4+ SD) covered on the three days were 891 286
metres, 955 ± 313 metres, and 996 336 metres. Thus the differences
(+ SE of mean) between the mean distances were 64 + 21 metres
between days I and 2 and 41 i 18 metres between days 2 and 3. In
this group, the mean FEV, was found to rise from 0-96 litre on day
1 to 1-14 litres on day 3. Analysis of covariance showed that, by
allowing for the changing FEV, the increase in distance travelled on
day 2 compared with that travelled on day 1 was significant at the 5",)
level, but the further increase on day 3 was not significant. A compari￾son of the results of day 3 with those of day 2 showed that four patients
walked less far and eight patients walked further. The mean change
(+ SD), as a percentage of the distance on day 2, was + 7 33
4 220,. The range of change was -6 70,, to + 15 30°,; the range of
the change in metres was -46 metres to + 137 metres.
Data from two days' tests were available in more subjects, both
inpatients and outpatients. In this group the mean increase in the
12-minute distance on day 2 (+ SE of mean) (49 13 4 metres) was
again highly significant (measured in 29 patients; P <0 001). But no
significant change between the two days occurred in FEVy, FVC, or
maximum work loads achieved on the ergometer (in 29 patients) or
Vo2 (ex) (in 26 patients) or the standard values2 of ventilation and
heart rate at an oxygen consumption of 33-5 mmol/min (750 ml/min)
(in 22 patients). Because of these findings the results of the tests on
the second day were used in the following analysib.
Data from the 35 patients, including the initial 12, were available
for correlating 12-minute distance, FEV,, and FVC. Distance walked
correlated significantly with FVC (r = 0 406; P<0 05) but not with
FEV, (r = 0-283; P>0 05).
Twenty-nine patients performed both the 12-minute test and the
progressive exercise test. Vo2 (ex) correlated well with FEV, (r￾0-65; P<0 01) and FVC (r = 0 67; P<0 01). There were less close,
though still significant, relationships between Vo2 (ex) and 12-minute
distance (r 0-52; P<0 01), and between VE (ex) and 12-minute
distance (r 0 53; P<0 01).
No ill effects of the walking test were observed apart from some
muscular stiffness.
Discussion
These results suggest that the distance covered in 12 minutes'
walking is a reproducible measure of effort tolerance in patients
with chronic bronchitis. The test requires no apparatus and is
applicable to patients with disease of all grades of severity. The
act of walking is familiar to all, while this is less true of exercise
on a bicycle ergometer or treadmill. Furthermore, the patient
can choose and adjust his own pace throughout the test, pausing
for rest if necessary. The use of a standard time rather than a
standard distance applies a more uniform test of endurance.
Twelve minutes has in other studies been shown to be an
appropriate length of time to test oxygen uptake and endurance.8
The important increase in distance walked on the second
occasion may have been due to practice, although no similar

improvement occurred in the values of the progressive exercise
test. The walking test must be carried out twice, therefore, to
achieve reproducible results.
In reviewing the usefulness of measuring the FEV, in chronic
bronchitis, most importantly this has been described as a guide
to prognosis. 9 It also correlates well with the maximum oxygen
uptake and ventilation achieved during a progressive exercise
test.'0 The relationships that we found closely match those
reviewed by Spiro et al."1 The FEV, and the closely related
maximum voluntary ventilation also correlate with effort
intolerance as assessed by a questionnaire.' 12 But Gilson and
Hugh-Jones12 studied coal miners who were not necessarily
bronchitics and many of whom had no or minimal symptoms.
Capel and Smart' showed a trend of diminishing FEV, from
controls through those with mild and moderate effort intolerance
to those with severe effort intolerance due to airways obstruction.
Their figures show, however, that at an FEV, of around 1 litre
there is a considerable range of effort intolerance. Confirming
this point, our data, based on direct measurement of effort
intolerance, showed that there was a striking lack of correlation
between FEV, and 12-minute distance, which emphasises the
range of performance found in patients with established airways
obstruction.
Performance in tests of the type of the 12-minute walk must
depend on various factors, iTicluding motivation, endurance,
respiratory function, cardiovascular fitness, and neuromuscular
function. These are also factors that govern "everyday disability."
We suggest that the 12-minute test shares with the respiratory
questionnaire the potential to establish everyday disability￾information that is not available from measurements of maximal
exercise performance. The 12-minute test has the advantage over
the questionnaire, however, that it is objective and allows patients
to be placed on a continuous scale of performance rather than in
arbitrary grades of disability.
Thus, although the FEV1 in chronic bronchitis correlates well
with the maximum performance, it does not predict effort
intolerance in tests requiring more-prolonged submaximal effort.
The reason for this may be that in patients with airways obstruc￾tion of this severity the factors limiting performance in tests
requiring maximum effort (including FEV1, maximum expiratory
flow volume curves, and progressive exercise testing) are the
mechanical properties of the airways.13 The 12-minute test and,
indeed, most everyday activities do not necessarily take all
patients to these limits.
The 12-minute test provides useful objective information
about exercise tolerance in chronic bronchitis. We are continuing
to explore its use in assessing exercise tolerance in chronic
bronchitis and other forms of respiratory disease.

How are mobile miniature radiography units insulated, what radiation
protection is used, and what scatter is there in the vicinity of the van?
The arrangements required for the radiation protection of mass
miniature radiographic equipment are governed by the principles that
apply to all radiographic procedures,' and responsibility for all
radiation protection matters lies with the controlling authority. The
scattered radiation dose near the van is influenced by three factors.
Firstly, the level of the primary beam is such that its lower edge is
a few metres off the ground. Secondly, the dose will be attenuated as
the beam passes through the wall of the van. Thirdly, it will fall off
rapidly outside the van as it is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance. The dose received by a member of the public
standing immediately next to the wall of a van for one hour should not
exceed one-tenth of the annual dose limit.2

Are combined oral contraceptives contraindicated in hyperlidaemia of
Frederickson type IIa ?
Presumably the answer depends, firstly, on whether the patient has
this condition or whether the oral contraceptive caused the hyper￾lipoproteinaemia in the first place and secondly whether further
treatment with an oestrogen-progestogen combination is apt to
exacerbate the abnormality. Certainly oral contraceptives can cause
a rise in serum cholesterol,1 and could therefore be responsible for the
xanthelasma and the Frederickson type IIa lipid profile. But oral
contraceptives usually have a more severe effect on the serum
triglyceride concentration, which are normal in these patients. The rise
in triglyceride is related to the dose of the oestrogen2 and may be
expected to be low with low-dose oral contraceptives. The question
is more complicated than appears at first sight. Although attention is
usually focused on the oestrogen component of the pill, the pro￾gestogen element is not without effect on lipid metabolism. Thus the
rise in serum triglyceride concentration is more in women receiving
mestranol and chlormadinone acetate than in women given mestranol
and norethisterone.3 Perhaps if the right combined oral contraceptive
is chosen the effect on this patient's lipid profile would be minimal.
None of this adds up to an absolute interdict on oral contraceptives
for women with a raised serum cholesterol. But this woman is already
in a category of increased risk of coronary artery disease. Why add
to that risk? I would not unless efficient contraception is imperative
for her and there is no other means of dealing with the problem.

A postmenopausal patient living in central Africa has suffered for a year
with what appears to be urethritis. The foul-smelling, brown urine grows
Doderlein's bacillus in great numbers. What investigation and treatment
are advisable?
Doderlein's bacillus is a normal commensal of the vagina. It does not
usually smell foul but the smell could be due to other anaerobic
organisms from the vagina such as bacteroides and streptococci. The
growth of these organisms suggests there is a connection between the
urethra or bladder and the vagina. This fistula may be quite small and
very difficult to detect. It may be easier to see if a dye such as methy￾lene blue is instilled into the urethra. Milk, which does not stain the
tissues yet is readily seen, may also be used. In the absence of a fistula
the urine may be becoming contaminated with vaginal organisms
during collection. The presence of many vaginal squames in the urine
deposit would indicate this. Urine should be examined within an hour
or two of collection to eliminate spuriously high bacterial counts due
to growth of contaminating organisms in the urine. A careful search
should also be made for pathogens in the vagina (trichomonas, candida,
etc) and these treated where appropriate.
