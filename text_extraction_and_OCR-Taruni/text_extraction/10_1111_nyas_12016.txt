Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the Western world and its incidence
is increasing rapidly. NAFLD is a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis, which is relatively benign hepatically, to
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis. Obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and dyslipidemia are the most important risk factors for NAFLD. Due to heavy enrichment with metabolic
risk factors, individuals with NAFLD are at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Individuals with
NAFLD have higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis of NAFLD requires imaging evidence of hepatic
steatosis in the absence of competing etiologies including significant alcohol consumption. Liver biopsy remains
the gold standard for diagnosing NASH and for determining prognosis. Weight loss remains a cornerstone of
treatment. Weight loss of ∼5% is believed to improve steatosis, whereas ∼10% weight loss is necessary to improve
steatohepatitis. A number of pharmacologic therapies have been investigated to treat NASH, and agents such as
vitamin E and thiazolidinediones have shown promise in select patient subgroups.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the
name given to a spectrum of liver disorders asso￾ciated with hepatic steatosis that is not due to sig￾nificant alcohol consumption or other secondary
causes, such as steatogenic medication, or inborn
errors of metabolism (Table 1). This disorder en￾compasses a wide range of diseases, from simple
steatosis, which is relatively benign, to hepatic in￾flammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrosis, a syn￾drome referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis.1–3 Over
the last three decades, NAFLD has emerged as one
of the leading causes of cirrhosis in the United States,
and a large proportion of individualswho previously
had been classified as having cryptogenic cirrhosis
are now believed to have cirrhosis due to NASH.4
NAFLD is becoming an increasingly impor￾tant health issue. In Western nations, including
the United States, NAFLD has become the most
common cause of chronic liver disease. The rate
of NAFLD is increasing likely due to the rising
prevalence of associated conditions such as obe￾sity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has
been projected that, within the next two decades,
NASH will become the predominant cause of
cirrhosis requiring orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion.5,6
This review focuses on clinical aspects of
NAFLD, such as epidemiology, natural history,
need for liver biopsy, and treatment options.
A detailed discussion of pathogenesis, genetic
investigations, and histological classification is
beyond the scope of this review, and interested
readers are referred to several recent excellent re￾views.7–14 A recently published multi-society prac￾tice guideline offers guidance on the diagnosis and
management of NAFLD for practicing healthcare
providers.15

Epidemiology of NAFLD
The epidemiology and natural history of NAFLD
remain incompletely understood, although studies
have begun to more clearly elucidate them. The inci￾dence offatty liver disease has been examined in only
a few studies. In an early study from Japan, the in￾cidence of NAFLD was estimated to be 31 per 1,000
person-years based on the incidence of elevated
aminotransferases as a surrogate for NAFLD.16 In a
more recent Japanese study, which employed bien￾nially abdominal ultrasound examination of 1,635
Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors without NAFLD
at baseline, the incidence of NAFLD was 19.9 per
1000 person-years (22.3 for men, 18.6 for women)
and peaked in the sixth decade of life.17 The annual
incidence of NAFLD in England was estimated to be
29 per 100,000 individuals in one study, but this fre￾quency is likely an underestimation because it was
based on outpatient hepatology referrals.18 In this
study, the incidence of NAFLD was much higher
than other types of chronic liver disease.
The estimated prevalence of NAFLD varies widely
likely secondary to difference in the population
studied and the method used to detect NAFLD.
The prevalence of suspected NAFLD based on el￾evated aminotransferases without imaging is be￾tween 7% and 11%, but this likely is an un￾derestimation because aminotransferases can be
normal in individuals with NAFLD.19 The preva￾lence of significant hepatic steatosis in potential
living donors for liver transplantation was 20%
by liver biopsy.20 The prevalence of NAFLD in
participants of the Dallas Heart Study, a multi￾ethnic population based study in Dallas County,
Texas, was 34% using magnetic resonance spec￾troscopy for hepatic triglyceride quantitation.21
The estimated prevalence of NASH is lower, rang￾ing from 3 to 5% of the general population
whereas the prevalence of NASH-related cirrhosis is
unknown.19
Ethnicity has a significant impact on the preva￾lence of NAFLD. In the Dallas Heart Study, the
prevalence of hepatic steatosis was 45% in Hispan￾ics, 33% in non-Hispanic Caucasians, and 24% in
African Americans.21 This difference in prevalence
was only partially explained by differences in obesity
and insulin resistance especially in African Ameri￾cans where the prevalence of NAFLD was lower than
in Caucasians with similar risk factors. This condi￾tion is highly prevalent in Asian population as well.
For example, in a Korean study of potential liver
donors who underwent liver biopsy, the presence of
NAFLD was 51%, with 10% revealing >30% steato￾sis and 2.2% with NASH.22
Gender has a significant impact on the prevalence
of NAFLD, withmost epidemiologic studies demon￾strating almost twice the prevalence of NAFLD in
males compared with females. In a study of 26,527
subjects undergoing medical checkups in China, the
prevalence of NAFLD by abdominal ultrasound was
31% in men and 16% in women.23 Similarly, a pop￾ulation based study in India demonstrated a 25%
prevalence of NAFLD in men compared with 14%
in women.24 The prevalence of NAFLD in the Dal￾las Heart Study was 42% in white men compared
with only 24% in white women and this difference
was not attributable to differences in body weight
or insulin sensitivity.21 However, this study found
no gender difference in the prevalence of NAFLD
in Hispanic and Black Americans. Studies have sug￾gested that estrogen may reduce the risk of develop￾ing NAFLD.25
Jejunoileal bypass surgery has long been recog￾nized as a cause of NAFLD likely due to the rapid￾ity of weight loss and bacterial overgrowth leading
to increased levels of endotoxin in the portal cir￾culation.26,27 This procedure has now been aban￾doned, and the current foregut bariatric surgical
procedures are not believed to cause or significantly
worsen NAFLD. The efficacy and role of foregut
bariatric surgery in individuals with NAFLD will
be discussed later in detail. Pancreaticoduodenec￾tomy has also been associated with an increased
risk of subsequent development of NAFLD. In one

series from Japan, the incidence of NAFLD after
pancreatico-duodenectomy NAFLD was 37% with
10% exhibiting NASH.28
A number of studies have examined the preva￾lence of NAFLD in patients attending obesity clin￾ics or undergoing bariatric surgery. The reported
prevalence of NAFLD in this group ranges from
57% to 91% whereas the prevalence of NASH ranged
from 26% to 37%.22,29–31 Unsuspected cirrhosis was
1.6–1.7%.29,30
Although obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM,
and dyslipidemia are the most important risk
factors, other endocrine conditions, such as
hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism,
and polycystic ovary syndrome, are also associated
with NAFLD (Table 2).32–35
Relationship of NAFLD to obesity
and diabetes
The majority of patients with NAFLD have
metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, T2DM, and
dyslipidemia. Conversely, the presence of NAFLD
is a risk factor for the subsequent development of
some metabolic disorders such as T2DM. T2DM is
not only a risk factor for the development of NAFLD
but also a riskfactorfor the development of cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma.36,37
Obesity and dyslipidemia are well-established
risk factors for NAFLD. A Japanese study found that
obesity, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance, and hy￾pertension were risk factors for the development of
NAFLD, though in the multivariate analysis, only
obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension re￾mained predictive.17 Similarly, a Korean study of
living donors found obesity, older age, and hyper￾triglyceridemia were independent risk factors for
NAFLD.22 The prevalence of NAFLD in patients re￾ferred to a lipid clinic was found to be 50% in one
series.38 Visceral fat accumulation appears to be a
significant risk for the development of NAFLD. A
study from Japan found that the severity of hep￾atic steatosis by ultrasound was positively correlated
with visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance
in both obese and nonobese subjects, suggesting that
hepatic steatosis may be influenced by visceral fat
accumulation regardless of body mass index.39
Metabolic syndrome, as defined by the Adult
Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria, is defined by
the presence of three or more of the following:
(1) waist circumference greater than 102 cm in
men or greater than 88 cm in women; (2) triglyc￾eride level greater than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or
drug treatment for elevated triglycerides; (3) high￾density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level less than
40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men and less than
50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women or on drug
treatment for low HDL; (4) systolic blood pressure
≥130 mm Hg or diastolic pressure ≥85 mm Hg or
treatment for hypertension; and (5) fasting plasma
glucose level ≥110 mg/dL or drug treatment for ele￾vated blood glucose.40 Patients with metabolic syn￾drome have an increased prevalence of NAFLD with
86% of patients with metabolic syndrome having
NAFLD, 24% exhibiting steatohepatitis, and unex￾pected cirrhosis in 2% by liver biopsy.41 An observa￾tional study from Japan demonstrated that men and
women with metabolic syndrome at baseline were
more likely to develop NAFLD during a 14 month
follow-up with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.0 and
11.2, respectively.42 Conversely, NAFLD increases
the risk for subsequent development of metabolic
syndrome.43
Insulin resistance and diabetes are both very im￾portant risk factors for the development of NAFLD.
Several studies have demonstrated that an elevated
insulin resistance index, either HOMA-IR greater
than 5.8 or FAIR score of 2 or greater, is a risk factor
for the development of NAFLD in overweight non￾diabetic individuals.29,30 In one series of patients
undergoing gastric bypass, the odds of NASH were
128 times greater and the odds of severe fibrosis 75
times greater in patients with T2DM than in those
without T2DM.31 Several recent studies have ob￾served that adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo
IR) may be an important predictor of liver histology

in individuals with NAFLD and may indeed predict
fibrosis progression.44,45 There are unconfirmed
reports that T1DM is associated with NAFLD
but these reports have not provided histological
confirmation of hepatic fat accumulation.46,47
NAFLD is an independent risk factor for the de￾velopment of T2DM. A study from South Korea
examined the effect of NAFLD on the risk of subse￾quent development of T2DM in patients with im￾pairedfasting glucose. Theincidence of T2DMin the
NAFLD group was 9.9% compared with 3.7% in the
non-NAFLD group suggesting that NAFLD has an
independent and additive effect on the development
of T2DM in individuals with insulin resistance.48
Natural history of NAFLD
The natural history of NAFLD has been examined
in a number of studies, although it remains incom￾pletely understood. The majority of patients with
simple steatosis will not develop NASH or advanced
fibrosis. However, simple steatosis may not be to￾tally benign as a portion of patients will progress
to NASH. Approximately 23% of patients with sim￾ple steatosis noted on an initial liver biopsy were
found to have NASH on a subsequent liver biopsy
36 months later.37 However, patients with NASH are
certainly at risk for histologic progression including
the development of cirrhosis. Age and the degree of
inflammation observed in the initial liver biopsy are
risk factors for progression to advanced fibrosis.49
Although only a small percentage of patients with
NAFLD will eventually develop cirrhosis, given the
large number of patients with NAFLD, this repre￾sents a significant disease burden. It is estimated that
approximately 5% of patients with NAFLD develop
cirrhosis.1
Subjects with NAFLD are at significantly higher
risk for cardiovascular disease, and in fact cardio￾vascular events are their most common cause of
death (Table 3). This association likely reflects high
prevalence of metabolic risk factors in individu￾als with NAFLD, rather than additional atherogenic
risk posed by the hepatic steatosis itself. Compared
to simple steatosis, NASH has higher liver-related
mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.71 for NASH
and an OR of 10.06 for NASH with advanced fibro￾sis.50 The cardiovascular mortality was found to be
similar between patients with simple steatosis and
those with NASH.50 When compared to patients
with chronic hepatitis C, patients with NAFLD with
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis have lower rates of
liver-related complications and hepatocellular can￾cer but similar overall mortality.51
Diagnosis of NAFLD
Diagnosis of suspected NAFLD involves establish￾ing that the patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria
for NAFLD and excluding the presence of other co￾existing liver diseases. Diagnosis of NAFLD requires
demonstration of hepatic steatosis by imaging or

histology and exclusion of significant alcohol use or
other secondary causes of steatosis. In addition to
alcohol consumption, secondary causes of hepatic
steatosis include medications, chronic hepatitis C
infection, parenteral nutrition, and Wilson’s disease
(Table 1).
Liver biochemistries and other laboratory
testing
In patients with suspected NAFLD, initial labora￾tory evaluation typically involves obtaining liver
biochemistries and exclusion of chronic viral hep￾atitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, and au￾toimmune hepatitis via appropriate diagnostic tests.
In patients with NAFLD, serum aminotrans￾ferases can be normal or mildly elevated. Serum
aminotransferases generally wax and wane and they
rarely exceed 200 U/L. Typically, ALT exceeds AST
although the serum AST frequently exceeds ALT
when there is advanced fibrosis.52 Alkaline phos￾phatase can also be elevated as well, and patients
can have only an isolated elevation of serum alkaline
phosphatase with normal aminotransferase levels.53
NAFLD is the most common cause of incidentally
found abnormal liver biochemistries in the primary
care setting.54 The sensitivity of abnormal amino￾transferases in detecting NAFLD is poor since 55%
to 79% of individuals with NAFLD may have nor￾mal transaminase levels.21 In patients with NAFLD,
neither the degree of elevation nor the pattern of
abnormal liver biochemistries are reliable in deter￾mining that the disease activity and risk of disease
progression. In addition, changes of aminotrans￾ferase levels do not parallel changes in fibrosis stage
preventing them from being a reliable surrogate for
fibrosis progression.55
Mildly elevated serum ferritin is common in
patients with NAFLD though it is typically not
associated with increased hepatic iron stores.56
However, elevated serum ferritin and transferrin
saturationin patientswith suspected NAFLD should
prompt genetic testing for hereditary hemochro￾matosis. A liver biopsy should be considered in a
patient with suspected NAFLD who is homozygous
or compound heterozygous for the C282Y mutation
in the HFE gene to assess hepatic iron concentra￾tion and to evaluate for significant liver injury and
fibrosis.
Mild elevations of autoantibodies are relatively
common in patients with NAFLD. A similar phe￾nomenon has been observed in liver disorders such
as viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury and
is generally considered as an epiphenomenon. A re￾cent study from the NASH Clinical Research Net￾work (NASH CRN), found that positive serum
autoantibodies, defined as antinuclear antibody
(ANA) titer ≥1:160 or antismooth muscle antibody
(ASMA) ≥1:40, were present in 21% of patients
with biopsy-proven NAFLD and they were not as￾sociated with more advanced histologic features.57
However, if there are additional features suggestive
of autoimmune hepatitis, such as markedly elevated
aminotransferase, high -globulin, or high serum
immunoglobulin G, then a liver biopsy may be con￾sidered necessary to firmly establish the diagnosis.
Several models have been developed that com￾bine laboratory testing, demographic variables, and
clinical data to predict NASH with advanced fi￾brosis, but their detailed discussion is beyond the
scope of this review article. The NAFLD fibrosis
score (http://nafldscore.com/) is a promising bed￾side tool for identifying NAFLD patients who are at
high risk for advanced fibrosis, and it employs six
easily available variables (age, hyperglycemia, body
mass index, platelet count, albumin, and AST/ALT
ratio).58 In a recent meta-analysis of 13 published
studies, the NAFLD fibrosis score had a pooled area
under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic
(AUROC) of 0.85 for predicting advanced fibro￾sis (stage 3 or 4). The NAFLD fibrosis score less
than 1.455 had 90% sensitivity and 60% specificity
to exclude advanced fibrosis, while a score greater
than 0.676 had 67% sensitivity and 97% speci￾ficity to identify the presence of advanced fibro￾sis.50 Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) panel employs
automated immunoassay of three serum markers of
matrix constituents andmediators ofmatrix remod￾eling (hyaluronic acid, amino-terminal propeptide
of type III collagen, and tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase 1).59 The ELF panel has an AU￾ROC of 0.90 for detection of advanced fibrosis with
a threshold of 0.3576 associated with a sensitivity of
80%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value
of 71%, and a negative predictive value of 94%.60
Studies suggest that hepatocyte apoptosis plays
an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH.
Hepatocyte apoptosis results in caspase 3 generated
cleavage fragment of cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) being
released. The serum CK-18 fragments can be mea￾sured by ELISA, and they significantly increased in

Masuoka & Chalasani Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
patients with NASH compared with simple steato￾sis and normal controls.61 The circulating levels of
CK-18 fragments have been shown to reflect disease
activity, and change in their level may correlate with
the change in NAFLD activity score.37 In a recent
meta-analysis, the pooled AUROC of serum CK-18
for detection of NASH was 0.82 with a sensitivity
and specificity of 78% and 87%, respectively.50
Imaging
A number of imaging modalities have been em￾ployed in the diagnosis of NAFLD. Although sev￾eral different imaging techniques are valuable in
demonstrating steatosis, the ability of current imag￾ing technologies to evaluate fibrosis and especially
inflammatory activity is limited.
Abdominal ultrasound is a relatively inexpensive,
noninvasive diagnostic test to demonstrate steatosis
with excellent sensitivity in individuals with mod￾erate to severe hepatic steatosis. Steatosis is visual￾ized as increased echogenicity with bright liver echo
pattern on ultrasound B-mode examination and
increased attenuation.62 In a study of ultrasound
paired with liver biopsy the reported sensitivity ul￾trasound for the detection steatosis of 64% to 91%,
and a specificity of 93% to 97%.63,64 Morbid obesity
was associated with a lower sensitivity, and higher
degrees of steatosis with a greater sensitivity.
Noncontrast abdominal CT is also useful in
demonstrating hepatic steatosis. When contrast en￾hanced CT is performed, the portal phase images
should be employed for the determination of steato￾sis though contrast may result in decreased sen￾sitivity and specificity compared with noncontrast
scans.65 On a CT scan, hepatic steatosis is visualized
as decreased attenuation of the liver, resulting in the
liver appearing darker than the spleen and is associ￾ated with decreased liver attenuation index, which is
the difference between the mean hepatic and splenic
attenuation in Hounsfield units. The sensitivity of a
CT scan for detecting steatosis greater than 30% was
as high as 82% in a study involving potential living
liver donors.65
Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is a sensitive technique for demonstrating steatosis.
T1-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance im￾ages are acquired with an echo time such that water
and lipid spins are in phase or opposed phase allow￾ing lipid quantitation by relative loss of signal inten￾sity on opposed-phase images compared with that
on in-phase images.66 In a study of potential living
donors MRI demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity,
and accuracy of 100%, and 92.3%, and 93%, re￾spectively, for detection of steatosis in patients with
greater than 20% steatosis by liver biopsy.67 Mag￾netic resonance spectroscopy has been employed to
quantitate hepatic steatosis by measuring hepatic
triglyceride content although its use remains pri￾marily investigational.68
Heterogeneity of hepatic steatosis including focal
sparing is a relatively common finding with each
of the imaging modalities.69–74 The most common
locations are the gallbladder fossa, and the areas ad￾jacent to the porta hepatis and falciform ligament.
Conversely, focal fatty infiltration can also be ob￾served where steatosis is increased in only one region
of the liver.
Transient elastography is an ultrasound-based
noninvasive method of assessing of fibrosis through
measurement of liver stiffness. Although insensitive
for detection of early fibrosis, transient elastogra￾phy can be useful in screening for advanced fibrosis
in many patients. In a study involving patients with
NAFLD, transient elastography demonstrated a sen￾sitivity of 91% and a specificity of 75% for detecting
stage 3 or higher fibrosis with positive and negative
predictive values of 52% and 97%, respectively.75
Unfortunately, body habitus can limit the applica￾tion of this study since there is an increased failure
rate in obtaining a successful transient elastogra￾phy measurement with increasing degree of obesity.
Also, transient elastography is not currently com￾mercially available in the United States. Magnetic
resonance elastography is a promising technique
that measures liver stiffness over a larger region of
the liver than transient elastography; this research
tool is currently available at a limited number of
centers.
Liver biopsy
Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for char￾acterizing the histology of NAFLD. It can play an
important role in the diagnosis of NAFLD, but
it is expensive and carries risk of morbidity and
very rarely mortality. Histological examination of
liver tissue allows for exclusion of competing eti￾ologies as well as for the assessment of coexisting
liver diseases. Currently, liver biopsy is the only tool
available for assessing the degree of inflammation
and cell injury and to stage for the degree of fibrosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Masuoka & Chalasani
It is invaluable to differentiate simple steatosis from
NASH.
Macrovesicular steatosis is a predominant feature
of NAFLD, and the presence of steatosis in greater
than 5% of hepatocytes is generally accepted as
fatty liver (Fig. 1A).76 In addition to steatosis,
common histologic findings in NASH include
hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation that is
either mixed type or neutrophil predominant, and
varying degrees of fibrosis (Figs. 1B and C).77 There
are no histologic features that reliably differentiate
NASH for alcoholic hepatitis, and the term NASH
was originally employed in a report from the Mayo
Clinic regarding 20 patients with a liver disease
that histologically mimicked alcoholic hepatitis
in patients without significant alcohol intake.78 A
histopathological classification system for NASH
was originally developed by Brunt et al., with
histologic features distinctive to NASH employed
in determining the necroinflammatory activity
(grade) and architectural alterations (stage).79 The
NAFLD activity score (NAS), an unweighted sum of
steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning scores, was
developed by the NASH CRN as a tool to quantify
changes in liver histology in NAFLD therapeutic
trials.76 There is not a threshold value of NAS that
reliably identifies the presence of NASH.80
There can be significant sampling error due to
the small portion of the liver sampled by a biopsy
and the inhomogeneous distribution of the histo￾logic lesions of NASH. This sample variability is
moderate for hepatocyte ballooning and perisinu￾soidal fibrosis and is somewhat higher for lobular
inflammation.81,82
Pathogenesis of NAFLD
Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the basis for fat accumulation,
liver injury, and fibrosis in NAFLD, but their detailed
discussion is beyond the scope of this review article.
Interested readers are alerted to several recent com￾prehensive reviews on this subject.7,8,10,83,84 Despite
considerable research in this area, the pathogenesis
of NAFLD remains incompletely understood. It has
been very challenging to differentiate causative fac￾tors from associated phenomena and downstream
effects. Although there is an increased understand￾ing of the pathogenesis of hepatic fat accumulation,
there are critical knowledge gaps in our understand￾ing of mediators and mechanisms of hepatocyte

injury, mediators of stellate cell activation, and
fibrosis. It remains a puzzle why some individuals
with NAFLD have advanced histological features
and develop cirrhosis whereas others with compara￾ble risk factor profile have simple steatosis with min￾imal or no disease progression. A genetic basis for
inter-individual phenotypic variability is strongly
suspected, but genetic studies are very limited in
individuals with histologically characterized NASH.
Insulin resistance is nearly universal in NAFLD
and it is believed to play a crucial role in the patho￾genesis of NAFLD. In adipocytes, insulin resistance
results in increased activity of hormone-sensitive li￾pase, which results in lipolysis of triglycerides and
release of free fatty acids into circulation. Fatty acids
taken up by hepatocytes from circulation and pro￾duced by de novo lipogenesis undergo esterifica￾tion resulting in hepatocytes steatosis. Initially it
was proposed that NASH resulted from a “two-hit”
mechanism with hepatocyte steatosis being the ini￾tial metabolic insult that then allows a second injury
leading to NASH.85 However, subsequent research
has cast significant doubt on this paradigm, and it
is now widely believed that free fatty acids and their
metabolic products (e.g., diacylglycerol) and seque￾lae (e.g., free radicals) are the likely mediators of
hepatocyte injury.8,86–89
At a cellular level, several different mechanisms
have been proposed for causing hepatocyte injury,
including apoptosis, perturbations in autophagy,
mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in natural
killer T cell and Kupffer cell function, and an in￾crease in inflammatory cytokines.8,90–96 Apopto￾sis appears to play an important role in hepato￾cyte death in NAFLD, and free fatty acids could
be the primary mediators of hepatocyte apopto￾sis (lipoapoptosis).83,90 In addition, phagocytosis of
hepatocyte apoptotic bodies by stellate cells leads to
their activation and likely plays an important role in
fibrosis.
Treatment of NALFD
Lifestyle modification
Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of treat￾ment of NAFLD. These interventions are not only
effective in improving NAFLD but also associated
conditions such as metabolic syndrome, T2DM, and
the related risk of cardiovascular disease.
Weight reduction plays an important role in the
treatment of NASH. Weight loss has been shown
to decrease hepatic steatosis and improve abnor￾mal aminotransferase levels.97–99 Weight loss can be
an effective treatment to improve the histology of
NASH if patients can attain sufficient weight reduc￾tion. In a study by Harrison et al., subjects with
biopsy-proven NASH who lost 5% of body weight
had improvement in insulin sensitivity and hep￾atic steatosis compared with those who lost less
than 5% of their body weight.100 However, it was
only in subjects who achieved at least 9% weight
reduction that there was significant improvement
in inflammation, ballooning, and NAS. A random￾ized controlled trial (RCT) involving patients with
biopsy-proven NASH by Promrat et al. examined
the efficacy of lifestyle intervention using a combi￾nation of diet, exercise, and behavior modification
compared to the control group that received struc￾tured education.101 The primary end-point in this
study was improvement in liver histology. Partici￾pants who achieved the study weight loss goal of at
least 7% had significant improvements in steatosis,
lobular inflammation, and ballooning injury. Per￾cent weight reduction correlated significantly with
improvement in NAS. Weight loss has been shown
to prevent progression of fibrosis in NASH.37
However, very rapid weight loss may lead to in￾creased portal inflammation and fibrosis. In a small
study of severely obese patients with NAFLD who
were placed on a very low calorie formula diet re￾sulting in a median weight loss of 34 kg over an
8-week period, 24% of patients developed mild por￾tal inflammation or portal fibrosis.102 Therefore,
one should be cautious in recommending very low
calorie diets for individuals with NAFLD.
Weight reduction surgery
Because NAFLD is present in the majority of pa￾tients who undergo bariatric surgery, there has been
an interest in foregut bariatric surgery as a potential
treatment option for NASH. Currently, there are no
RCTs that have examined foregut bariatric surgery
as a treatment option for NAFLD or NASH. How￾ever, several retrospective and prospective cohort
studies have compared liver histology in the severely
obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery.
Unfortunately, a majority of them do not have
uniform histologic evaluation by post-bypass liver
biopsies and instead performed biopsies at varying
intervals and only in selected patients undergoing
other surgical procedures such as abdominal hernia

repair. However, one exception is the seminal study
byMathurin et al., that prospectively correlated clin￾ical and metabolic data with liver histology before
and 1 and 5 years after bariatric surgery in 381 adult
patients with severe obesity.103 There was a signif￾icant improvement in steatosis and ballooning at 1
and 5 years following bariatric surgery compared to
baseline. In patients with probable or definite NASH
at baseline, there was significant improvement in
steatosis, ballooning, and NAS and resolution of
probable or definite NASH at 1 and 5 years follow￾ing bariatric surgery. The majority of histological
benefits were present at 1 year with no differences
in liver histology between 1 and 5 years following
bariatric surgery. Because no patient in this study
had cirrhosis at baseline, the effect of bariatric
surgery in patients with cirrhosis could not be
evaluated.
There are two meta-analyses that evaluated the
influence of bariatric surgery on liver histology
in adults with NAFLD. Mummadi et al. found
that steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis improve
or completely resolve after bariatric surgery in a
significant proportion of patients.104 However, a
Cochrane review concluded that lack of RCTs or
other high-quality clinical studies prevents defini￾tive determination of benefits and risks of bariatric
surgery as a treatment option for patients with
NASH.105
A recently published multi-society practice
guideline concluded that it is premature to consider
foregut bariatric surgery as an established option
to specifically treat NASH.15 However, it concluded
that foregut bariatric surgery is not contraindicated
in otherwise eligible obese individuals with NAFLD
or NASH.
Vitamin E
Oxidative stress has been proposed as an impor￾tant mediator of hepatic injury in NASH.88,106,107
Vitamin E comprises a series of closely related com￾pounds with antioxidant activity that have been
employed in several therapeutic trials of NASH,
although small sample sizes, differences in vita￾min E preparations, and differences in endpoints
have made them difficult to compare. The PIVENS
trial, a recent randomized double blind placebo
controlled trial, is the largest study to investigate
the effectiveness of vitamin E supplementation on
nondiabetic adults with histologically confirmed
NASH.108 This study employed unmodified RRR￾alpha-tocopherol administered as a once daily dose
of 800 IU given for 96 weeks. Vitamin E supplemen￾tation resulted in significant improvement in patho￾logic features of NASH with improvement in NAS
seen in 42% of patients receiving vitamin E com￾pared with 19% of patients receiving placebo with
a number needed to treat of 4.4. Compared with
placebo, vitamin E significantly improved amino￾transferases as well. Vitamin E was well tolerated
in this trial. The effectiveness of vitamin E supple￾mentation has not been evaluated in diabetic pa￾tients with NASH or in patients with NASH-related
cirrhosis.
Some concerns have been raised regarding the
long-term safety of vitamin E, although current data
suggest that serious toxicity from vitamin E is likely
very small if present. A recent RCT of vitamin E
administered at a dose of 400 IU/day found a sta￾tistically non-significant increase in prostate cancer
risk in the vitamin E group with an absolute in￾creased risk of 1.6 per 1,000 person years of vita￾min E use.109 Whether vitamin E supplementation
may increase all-cause mortality remains contro￾versial. While some early meta-analyses suggested
a possible increase in all-cause mortality associ￾ated with vitamin E supplementation, subsequent
studies have failed to demonstrate any increased
mortality.110–115
Insulin-sensitizing agents
Insulin-sensitizing agents have been investigated ex￾tensively in therapeutic trials since insulin resistance
is believed to play an important role in the patho￾genesis of NAFLD.
Metformin has been employed in a number of
therapeutic trials of NASH. While several small
open-label studies suggested some improvement
in aminotransferase levels with metformin ther￾apy, a study in which only the metformin arm
underwent biopsy suggested that it might lead to
histologic improvement.116 However, subsequent
randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials have
failed to show a significant difference in liver histol￾ogy in nondiabetic patients with insulin resistance
and NASH.117,118 Because metformin does not have
a significant effect on liver histology in patients with
NASH compared with lifestyle modification alone,
the use of metformin as therapy for NASH is not
recommended.15

Masuoka & Chalasani Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are oral antidiabetic
medications that increase insulin sensitivity by ac￾tivation of peroxisome proliferator-activated recep￾tors present in a number of tissues, including liver,
skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. An early non￾randomized trial, involving 22 patients with biopsy￾proven NASH (including 50% with impaired
glucose tolerance and diabetes) treated with rosigli￾tazone 4 mg twice daily for 48 weeks, demon￾strated improvement in inflammation, hepatocyte
ballooning, and fibrosis on an end-of-treatment
liver biopsy.119 However, weight gain occurred in
67% of patients with a median body weight increase
of 7.3%.
The RCTs of TZDs have generally shown his￾tologic improvement with TZDs in patients with
NASH, although there has been variability in cer￾tain parameters, such as improvement in inflamma￾tion and fibrosis. In an early double-blind placebo
controlled study by Belfort et al., pioglitazone
(45 mg/day) combined with a hypocaloric diet sig￾nificantly improved steatosis, hepatocyte balloon￾ing, and inflammation compared with a hypocaloric
diet alone in patients with biopsy-proven NASH and
either T2DM or insulin resistance.120 Improvement
in the NAS was seen in 73% of patients treated with
pioglitazone compared to 24% of placebo-treated
patients (P < 0.001), and there was a trend toward
improvement in fibrosis in patients receiving pi￾oglitazone (P < 0.08). A randomized trial of 63
patients with biopsy-proven NASH by Ratziu et al.,
found that rosiglitazone treatment (4 mg/day for the
first month and 8 mg/day thereafter) for one year
improved aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis,
but not necroinflammation, fibrosis or NAS.121 A
two-year open-label extension phase of this study
demonstrated similar results with no significant im￾provement in hepatocyte ballooning, intralobular
inflammation, fibrosis, or NAS seen in the rosiglita￾zone treatment group compared with the control
group.122 Aithal et al., conducted a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of lifestyle intervention
with either pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or placebo for
12 months in a total of 74 nondiabetic patients with
NASH.123 Although steatosis did not improve sig￾nificantly compared to placebo, cellular injury and
fibrosis improved significantly. Weight gain was ob￾served in the TZD group in each of these studies
and ranged from 1.5 to 2.77 kg, whereas the placebo
control groups lost 0.55 to 1 kg.
The PIVENS study is a recent large RCT that
randomized 247 nondiabetic patients with biopsy￾proven NASH to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin
E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months.124 The
primary endpoint was an improvement in NAS by
at least 2 points, with at least a one-point improve￾ment in hepatocellular ballooning and a one-point
improvement in either the lobular inflammation
or steatosis score, and no increase in the fibrosis
score.108 This endpoint was achieved in 34% of the
pioglitazone group (P = 0.04 vs. placebo) and 43%
of the vitamin E group (P = 0.001 vs. placebo) com￾pared with 19% in the placebo group. The resolution
of NASH, a key secondary end point, was achieved in
significantly higher percentage of patients receiving
pioglitazone compared with placebo (47% vs. 21%,
P = 0.001). Similar to prior trials, pioglitazone was
associated with a 4.7 kg weight gain compared to
placebo. A recent meta-analysis that included four
high quality randomized placebo controlled trials
showed that TZDs significantly improved steato￾sis (OR 3.39, 95% 2.19–5.25), inflammation (OR
2.58, 95% CI: 1.68–3.97), and ballooning (OR 2.11,
95% CI:1.33–3.36), but not fibrosis (combined OR
1.40, 95% CI 0.87–2.24).125 When studies involving
pioglitazone alone were analyzed, there was statisti￾cally significant improvement in fibrosis (combined
OR 1.68, 95% CI: 1.02–2.77).
The addition of metformin to rosiglitazone has
recently been investigated but metformin did not of￾fer additional histologic improvement over rosigli￾tazone treatment alone in two open-labeled RCTs
and more importantly metformin did not mitigate
TZD associated weight gain.118,126
There is considerable debate about the long￾term safety of TZDs with reference to increased
risk of cardiovascular events, congestive heart
failure (CHF), bladder cancer, and bone loss.
A meta-analysis of trials involving rosiglitazone
demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of
myocardial infarction (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.98,
P = 0.03).127 This is distinct from the meta-analysis
of 19 trials of pioglitazone enrolling a total of 16,390
patients with T2DM, pioglitazone treatment was as￾sociated with a significant reduction in the primary
outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke
(P = 0.005).128 However, there was increased
incidence of CHF with pioglitazone (2.3% vs.
1.8% in the control group, P = 0.002). Therefore,
caution must be exercised when considering
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1281 (2013) 106–122 c 2013 New York Academy of Sciences. 115

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Masuoka & Chalasani
TZDs in patients with preexisting cardiac dis￾ease. Owing to increased risk of cardiac events,
rosiglitazone availability is highly restricted in
the United States and is no longer marketed in
Europe.
Statins, omega-3 fatty acids, and
ursodeoxycholic acid
Dyslipidemia is almost universal in patients with
NAFLD, and the effect of lipid-lowering therapy
with statins on NALFD has been evaluated in several
studies. The St. Francis Heart Study demonstrated
that atorvastatin 20 mg combined with vitamins
C and E is effective in reducing the odds of hav￾ing hepatic steatosis as determined by CT although
no histologic evaluation was performed.129 The
post hoc analysis of the Greek Atorvastatin and Coro￾nary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study of
227 patients with possible NAFLD based on moder￾ately abnormal liver tests at baseline treated with a
statin demonstrated improvement inliver tests with￾out an increase in liver-related adverse effects com￾pared with controls.130 Several other studies have
demonstrated that statins are safe in patients with
liver disease, and there is no evidence that patients
with NAFLD are at increased risk for serious liver in￾jury from statins compared with those without liver
disease.131–134 There are no RCTs with histological
end points that have examined the use of statins
in the treatment of NASH, and thus statins specif￾ically to treat NASH cannot be advocated at this
time.15
Treatment of NAFLD with fish oil supplemen￾tation or polyunsaturated fatty acids that are en￾riched in fish oil omega 3 fatty acids has been
investigated in animal studies and a small num￾ber of preliminary human studies. Epidemiologic
studies have suggested that there may be an in￾verse relationship between the level of fish oil
intake and risk of NAFLD.135,136 However, the as￾sociation is relatively modest and was not statis￾tically significant in some studies after adjusting
for confounding factors. Several small nonrandom￾ized open-label study of omega-3 fatty acids alone
or with supplements such as olive oil have found
improvement in liver tests, serum triglycerides,
and steatosis by ultrasound.137–140 A large multi￾center trial of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapen￾tanoic acid to treat NASH is ongoing in the United
States. At this point, it is premature to recommend
omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of NAFLD al￾though they may be considered for the treatment of
hypertriglyceridemia.
There has been interest in the use of ursodes￾oxycholic acid (UDCA) to treat NAFLD although
studies to date have yielded disappointing results.
UDCA is a secondary bile acid that is approved for
the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis and has
effects on cholesterol absorption and inflammation.
Initial small uncontrolled clinical studies suggested
that UDCA may offer benefit to individuals with
NASH. However, a two-year prospective, double￾blind trial of UDCA (13–15 mg/kg per day) of
166 patients failed to demonstrate improvement
in laboratory data or liver histology.141 Subsequent
studies have employed high dose UDCA with mixed
results. A RCT of high-dose UDCA (28–35 mg/kg
per day) given for 12 months in patients with NASH
by Ratziu et al., demonstrated that UDCA improved
transaminase levels and markers of insulin resis￾tance and fibrosis.142 Critically, no histologic eval￾uation was performed. Leuschner et al. performed
a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
trial of high-dose UDCA (23–28 mg/kg/day) in
185 patients with histologically proven NASH.143
The treatment was provided over 18 months
with both pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies.
Although lobular inflammation was improved
in patients in the treatment group, there was
no improvement in fibrosis and no significant
difference in NAS between the treatment and
control group. In summary, there is no evidence
that UDCA is effective to treat NASH.
Emerging therapies
Table 4 describes selected compounds that are being
tested in large phase 2/3 studies. A large randomized
placebo controlled trial of two doses of eicosapen￾tanoic acid is near completion in the United States
and its results are eagerly awaited. Pentoxifylline has
shown encouraging histological benefits in several
small studies and it is a suitable candidate for fur￾ther testing in large multicenter RCTs. The NASH
CRN is conducting a multicenter RCT of obeticholic
acid in adults with NASH and a multicenter RCT of
cysteamine bitartrate in children with NASH. Their
results will not be available until 2014 and 2015, re￾spectively. Obeticholic acid is a novel FXR agonist,
whereas cysteamine bitartrate is a potent antioxi￾dant.

Surveillance for the development
of complications
In addition to their risk of developing cirrhosis,
liver failure, and hepatocellular cancer, patients with
NAFLD are at significantly higher risk for develop￾ing diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and thus
there should be heightened attention to monitoring
for the development of these conditions.
In patients with NASH related cirrhosis, regular
surveillance for cirrhosis related complications such
as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and esophageal
varices should be performed. As with other causes
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1281 (2013) 106–122 c 2013 New York Academy of Sciences. 117

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Masuoka & Chalasani
of cirrhosis, surveillance for HCC should be per￾formed every 6 months with abdominal ultrasound,
or intravenous contrast enhanced abdominal CT or
MRI. Yearly cumulative incidence of HCC in pa￾tients with NASH-related cirrhosis was found to be
2.6% in one series. This was less than the yearly
cumulative incidence in patients with hepatitis C
cirrhosis of 4.0% though the difference was not sta￾tistically significant.144
Conclusions
Individuals with obesity and T2DM are at signif￾icantly higher risk for NAFLD. The incidence of
NAFLD is rapidly increasing throughout the world
due to the increasing frequency of obesity and
T2DM. The NAFLD is a spectrum of chronic liver
diseases ranging from simple steatosis, which is rel￾atively benign from a liver standpoint, to NASH,
which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.
The diagnosis of NAFLD requires imaging evi￾dence of hepatic steatosis while excluding com￾peting etiologies, such as significant alcohol con￾sumption, viral hepatitis, and hemochromatosis.
Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diag￾nosing NASH and for assessing fibrosis. Recent
advances in laboratory testing and noninvasive
imaging have shown promise for identifying steato￾hepatitis and advanced fibrosis in individuals with
NAFLD. Weight loss of at least 5% is required to im￾prove steatosis, whereas weight loss in the range of
7–10% may be needed to improve steatohepatitis. A
number of pharmacologic therapies have been eval￾uated in NASH, and agents such as vitamin E and
TZDs have shown some promise. Ongoing studies
hold promise for developing more effective diag￾nostic tests and therapies.
