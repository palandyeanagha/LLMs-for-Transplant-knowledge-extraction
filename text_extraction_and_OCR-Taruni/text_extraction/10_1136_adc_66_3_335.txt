Staff training: a key factor in reducing intravascular
catheter sepsis
J W L Puntis, C E Holden, S Smallman, Y Finkel, R H George, I W Booth
Abstract
A children's hospital nutritional care team
prospectively monitored the frequency of sep￾sis in central venous catheters used for admi￾nistering parenteral nutrition. During an ini￾tial study period of 12 months, 26/58 (45%) of
catheters were removed because of proved
sepsis. The possible causes of this alarmingly
high rate were examined, with catheter care
techniques on the wards coming under parti￾cular scrutiny. As a result protocols were
modified and an intensive staff training prog￾ramme implemented throughout the hospital,
led by the nutritional care sister. Subse￾quently, the catheter sepsis rate was signifi￾cantly reduced with only 9/107 (8%) of con￾secutive catheters becoming infected. These
findings emphasise the key role that education
of staff plays in controlling central venous
catheter sepsis and the importance and cost
effectiveness of special nursing staff in imple￾menting such measures.

Central venous catheterisation provides reliable
venous access during parenteral nutrition and
permits the administration of hypertonic solu￾tions. Catheter related sepsis remains an impor￾tant unsolved problem1 2 and results in signifi￾cant morbidity and mortality. Infection control
measures should include periodic prospective
review of sepsis rates. In our hospital all paren￾teral nutrition is prescribed by a member of the
nutritional care team3; this team also monitors
complications related to nutritional support.
Over a 12 month period (study 1) it became
apparent that there had been a considerable
increase in the rate of catheter sepsis above the
15% previously determined.4 A number of
different strategies for preventing sepsis have
been proposed,5 some of which have not been
proved effective in practice.6 7 The importance
of impeccable catheter care, although difficult
to define, is generally regarded as being crucial.
We therefore determined to focus attention on
existing central venous catheter care protocols
and examine the way they were applied on the
wards. This study describes our investigation of
the epidemic, the ways in which we sought to
improve matters, and the results of a planned
education programme (study 2).
Subjects and methods
STUDY 1
Forty consecutive patients referred to the nutri￾tional care team for parenteral feeding were
included. Two thirds had undergone gastro￾intestinal surgery, most in the neonatal period.
Cardiac surgery accounted for 20% and cardiac,
oncology, and gastroenterology patients made
up the rest. The median (range) age at starting
parenteral feeding was 15 days (2 days-9 years).
A total of 58 central venous catheters were
studied, comprising equal numbers of percuta￾neous Silastic8 and Broviac catheters. Percuta￾neous catheters were inserted on the ward and a
dry dressing applied to the skin entry site before
taping in place with adhesive plaster. The skin
entry site was not routinely inspected unless
there were clinical suspicions of catheter sepsis,
and dressings were not routinely changed unless
soiled or loose. Broviac catheters were inserted
under general anaesthesia in an operating
theatre, usually by cutdown onto an internal
jugular vein. A clear adhesive dressing (Opsite,
Smith and Nephew) was then applied. All
catheters were sited with their tip just within
the right atrium.
Catheters were used exclusively for parenteral
nutrition and not for administration of drugs or
blood sampling. Parenteral feed source con￾tainers were changed every 24 hours and a 0-2
micron filter used in line with the amino acid/
dextrose preparation. In the event of the cathe￾ter hub being disconnected (occlusion requiring
flushing, or filter breakage), feed solutions were
replaced with 10% dextrose until the next day's
feed prescription became available.
A diagnosis of probable catheter sepsis was
made in a feverish or unwell patient without evi￾dence of focal infection such as otitis or pneu￾monia, and when urine culture was negative.
Primary catheter sepsis was then considered to
be proved when peripheral blood cultures were
positive for bacterial pathogens. Treatment
involved catheter removal and intravenous anti￾biotics, usually vancomycin and gentamicin,
until sensitivities of organisms were available.
Non-quantitative bacteriological techniques
were used for blood cultures. Samples were
placed in brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid UK
Ltd) for aerobic culture, and thyoglycollate
medium USP (Oxoid UK Ltd) for anaerobic
culture. Broth bottles were incubated at 37°C
and examined each day for evidence of growth.
Positive cultures were subcultured to blood agar
and examined by Gram film. All bottles were
routinely subcultured at 48 hours and again
after seven days' incubation. Fungal organisms
were routinely sought.
Catheter tips were rolled across the surface of
5% blood agar plates, using the technique of
Maki et al,9 and were then incubated aerobically
at 37°C. Using this method colony counts
greater than 15 were considered additional evi￾dence for catheter sepsis. The final diagnosis

was based on positive blood cultures and clinical
features, including symptomatic improvement
after catheter removal. In four cases of catheter
sepsis occurring in patients on long term paren￾teral feeding, antibiotic treatment was given
with the catheter left in situ. In two instances
blood cultures remained positive at 48 hours
and the catheter was then removed, and on two
occasions after 48 hours of treatment, blood
cultures remained negative and antibiotics were
successfully discontinued after two weeks with
the catheter left in situ.
Education programme
Staff communication-After the analysis of the
results in study 1, meetings were held between
the nutritional care team and consultant micro￾biologist and staff from medical and surgical
units. Routines for changing parenteral feed
infusions and dealing with blocked lines were
scrutinised by the microbiologist as they were
being performed on the ward.
Hand washing-Forty per cent of medical and
nursing staff were observed to follow an incom￾plete hand washing technique and efforts were
directed at teaching correct hand washing
procedure.
o
Bag changes-After their usual practice of hand
washing for two minutes in antiseptic soap
(Hibiscrub), nurses were asked to start wearing
sterile gloves. In addition to immersing the
catheter hub in 70% isopropyl alcohol before
disconnection, it was decided that the tubing up
to 20 cm on either side of the catheter hub
should also be cleaned with
a gauze soaked in
alcohol and then allowed to dry.
New guidelines for catheter care were drawn
up,"1 emphasising the importance of aseptic
technique, and the importance of minimising
hub disconnections and line violations. It was
agreed that two nurses rather than one should
always be involved with changing parenteral
nutrition feed bags so that one could handle
only sterile equipment and the other 'dirty'
equipment. This practice had lapsed under
pressure of work on the ward where most paren￾terally fed patients were cared for, and only one
nurse had been changing feeding bags.
Training-Given the high turnover of medical
and nursing staff it was apparent that training
programmes should recur at regular intervals so
that new medical and nursing staff could be
taught correct procedures. The need for junior
medical staff to seek guidance from senior ward
nurses on line care, for example when flushing
a
blocked central venous catheter, was empha￾sised and accepted. A further series of meetings was arranged
between medical and surgical teams and nutri￾tional care sister to emphasise the importance of
central venous catheter care, and arrangements
made for this topic to be covered at each induc￾tion day for new medical and surgical staff.
Practical demonstrations of line care and bag
changing were organised for all nursing staff.
Attendance was compulsory, and training car￾ried out over a three month period. The nutri￾tional care sister and clinical support nursing
officer also arranged practical demonstrations of
line care on all those wards regularly dealing
with central lines.
A video film showing bag
changing and line flushing was also made by the
department of medical illustration and the nut￾ritional care sister and used in subsequent
teaching sessions.
STUDY
2
After the intensive education programme, 92
patients were studied with
a median age (range)
at the start of parenteral feeding of 13 days
(1 day-15 years). Seventy five (81%) patients
were under
1 year of age and most (50, 54%)
were recovering from gastrointestinal surgery;
24 (26%) had had cardiac surgery and the
remaining patients had various different indica￾tions for nutritional support. In all, 107 central
lines were inserted, and these comprised 35
triple lumen and 12 double lumen Vygon cathe￾ters, 34 percutaneous Silastic, and 26 Broviac
catheters. Vygon catheters were inserted percu￾taneously either in theatre or on the intensive
care unit and one channel devoted exclusively to
administration of parenteral feeding solutions.
Otherwise catheter insertion, dressing, and
parenteral feeding protocols together with cri￾teria for diagnosing sepsis were the same as in
study 1.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Comparisons of the ages of patients at the start
of parenteral nutrition and of catheter life was
made using the Mann-Whitney
U test. The inci￾dence of catheter sepsis in each study was com￾pared using the x2 test.
Results
STUDY
1 (BEFORE EDUCATION PROGRAMME)
The median (range) catheter life was 15 (3-66)
days, giving
a total of 963 catheter days in all.
Thirteen of each type of catheter (26/58, 45%)
became primarily infected, representing one
episode of sepsis every 42 catheter days. Infec￾tions occurred sporadically after line insertion
and no significant difference was found compar￾ing the duration of catheter life in infected and
non-infected catheters (p=0 64). In 23 cases,
coagulase negative staphylococci were isolated
from blood and/or line, with Staphylococcus
aureus being found in two cases and Escherichia
coli in one.
STUDY
2 (AFTER EDUCATION PROGRAMME)
The median (range) catheter life was 10 (1-84)
days giving
a total of 1684 catheter days in all.
Now, only 9/107 (8%) of catheters became pri￾marily infected (five percutaneous Silastic,
three Vygon, one Broviac),
a significantly lower
number than before the education programme
(p<000l) representing one episode of sepsis/
189 days of catheter use. Again, infections
occurred sporadically after catheter insertion
and the life of infected catheters was not signifi￾cantly greater than that of non-infected cathe￾ters (p=017). E coli was isolated from four
cases of catheter sepsis, coagulase negative
staphylococci from three, and Klebsiella
aerogenes and Streptococcus viridans from the
remaining two.

Stafftraining: a keyfactor in reducing intravascular catheter sepsis 337
There was no significant difference found
when comparing the age of patients at the start
of parenteral feeding in each group (p=0 24)
but catheter life was significantly shorter in the
patients in study 2 (p=001).
Discussion
The first part of this study showed that catheter
sepsis rates among parenterally fed patients had
increased from 15% to 45%, after a period when
catheter infection had not been closely moni￾tored. An intensive programme of staff educa￾tion was then initiated, which emphasised the
importance of scrupulous aseptic technique and
led to several changes in catheter care protocols.
We cannot, of course, be sure about the precise
mechanisms by which our education prog￾ramme brought about such a dramatic reduc￾tion in catheter sepsis rates from 45% to 8%
(see table). Perhaps the most important of these
was the requirement that two people should be
involved with each central venous catheter dis￾connection and feed bag change. Although this
had previously been our recommendation, the
practice had lapsed during a period when
increasing numbers of patients were cared for
by fewer nursing staff.
The reduction in catheter sepsis after imple￾mentation of the education programme could
not be accounted for by other factors. The age
of patients and clinical indications for feeding
were much the same in each part of the study.
Although the length of time for which catheters
were in situ was significantly greater in study 1,
in neither study was there a simple association
between days in situ and risk of infection.
Sepsis occurred sporadically after insertion, and
no significant difference was found comparing
catheter life in non-infected and infected cathe￾ters. Although Vygon percutaneous catheters
were used during study 2, the reduction in
catheter sepsis remains unchanged even if these
are excluded from the analysis.
In controlling complications of parenteral
nutrition, particularly catheter related sepsis,
the key role of specially trained nursing staff,7 12
often in the context of a nutritional care team,'3
has gained widespread recognition, together
with the appreciation that they are cost effec￾tive. Based on the assumption that patients who
develop catheter sepsis probably stay on average
a week longer in hospital than they would
otherwise have done, the cost saving brought
about by our intervention study through a
reduction in infection over the next year would
have been approximately £80 000 (£870-00 per
parenterally fed patient). This takes into
account the cost of antibiotic treatment and
mean cost of one week's inpatient care.
Factors which may help reduce central venous catheter sepsis
Prospective audit Warns of adverse trends
Raises staff awareness
Catheter use Dedicated to parenteral feeding
Minimal line violation
Bag changes Two nurse system
Sterile gloves
Attention to hub and adjacent tubing
Training Recurrent staff training programme
Ward demonstrations
Video film
Central role of nutritional care nurse
Infecting organisms come primarily from the
catheter hub,'1'6 and studies which have con￾centrated on minimising the risk of bacterial
hub contamination have shown significant
reductions in sepsis rate. 7 Catheter infection by
organisms gaining access to the bloodstream
from the skin entry site is relatively uncommon;
this explains why attempts to reduce sepsis rates
by topical application of antibiotic and antisep￾tic agents,6 or by bringing the catheter out
through a skin tunnel,'8 have not been shown to
be effective.
Prevention of central venous catheter sepsis is
particularly difficult in infants, who often have
skin contaminated with faeces, and who tend to
play with or chew on catheters and connections.
There is a natural reluctance on the part of
many units to publish figures showing a high
catheter sepsis rate, although some have
reported experiences similar to our own.'9 20
We suspect that even collection of such data is
not routine in many centres and yet our study,
the first of its kind in children, emphasises how
infection rates can suddenly increase. Careful
prospective monitoring of catheter sepsis is
essential if adverse trends are to be reliably
identified at an early stage and then reversed.
