Abstract
We describe the establishment and current content of the ImmuneCODE™ database, which includes
hundreds of millions of T-cell Receptor (TCR) sequences from over 1,400 subjects exposed to or infected
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as over 135,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. This
database is made freely available, and the data contained in it can be downloaded and analyzed online
or offline to assist with the global efforts to understand the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
and develop new interventions.
Introduction
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December of 20191 and the ensuing pandemic declared by the WHO
at the end of January 20202 created an urgent need to understand the disease and its causative agent.
Initial studies have shown a strong T-cell based adaptive immune response3,4,5, but its detailed nature
remains uncharacterized. We therefore applied our previously described immunoSEQ® Assay6,7,8 and
MIRA™ tool9,10 to deepen the understanding of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
in support of COVID-19 research. 
To generate these data, we partnered with Microsoft, Illumina, Labcorp/Covance, and health
organizations across the world to generate the ImmuneCODE database described herein. These data are
being made freely available to the scientific community so that any researcher, public health official or
organization can utilize the data to accelerate ongoing global efforts to develop better diagnostics,
vaccines and therapeutics, as well as to answer important questions about the virus.
The database consists of two distinct but related datasets. (A) The immunoSEQ dataset includes 1,414
deeply- sampled TCRb repertoires from subjects who at the time of sampling either had been exposed
to, were actively suffering from, or had recovered from COVID-19. These data originate from two sources
(Table 1): ImmuneRACE (Immune Response Action to COVID-19 Events), an ongoing prospective study
enrolling participants across the
U.S. to decode how immune systems detect and respond to the virus, which includes self-reported
demographic and clinical data, and (2) thousands of de-identified geographically and ethnically diverse
patient blood samples collected by institutions around the world. (B) The MIRA dataset maps TCRs
binding to SARS-Cov-2 virus epitopes, and includes data obtained from exposed subjects and naïve
controls. In total, the MIRA dataset includes more than 135,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific
TCRs.
The data include varying degrees of demographic and clinical information (as allowed by each institution
and corresponding IRB). Additional metadata may be added in the future.

Page 5/29
The ImmuneCODE database will continue to grow both as we continue to recruit participants to
ImmuneRACE and as we add samples collected by additional institutions. This will result in additional T￾cell repertoires of exposed and infected individuals and SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs, allowing the
association of T-cell signatures with disease and outcomes. We hope that this freely available resource
will inform our understanding of the immune response to the virus and that it will be useful for
researchers around the world by accelerating their work in basic and applied immunology, thus
contributing to the development of new therapeutic and preventive measures.
Results
Dataset Access
The ImmuneCODE database includes both immunoSEQ and MIRA data (Figure 1a). and is being shared
through the immuneACCESS® data portal (Figure 1b), which enables the export of complete or selected
data, as well as real-time analysis using a rich suite of custom-built tools. Data are available at
(https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/covid-2020; DOI 10.21417/ADPT2020COVID). Note that the
dataset will continue to grow over time; subjects described in this article can be identified by selecting
samples with the “ImmunoCODERelease” tag value “002”. 
immunoSEQ data
The ongoing immueRACE study aims to enroll 1,000 subjects who have been exposed to, are currently
infected with, or have recovered from COVID-19. The current release of the database includes T-cell
repertoire data from the first 160 participants in the study (including multiple samples from some
subjects); new data will be added as it is generated. This release also includes T-cell repertoire data from
1,254 subjects from 6 global collaborators (Table 1); new T-cell repertoires may be generated both by
adding new samples from these ongoing studies, and by incorporating additional institutions to this
effort.
These data were generated from participant samples using the TCRb immunoSEQ Assay as previously
described6,7,8. They include a list of unique TCRb rearrangements found in each analyzed sample, a
count for each rearrangement, and sample-level metadata. Certain pre-configured analyses we believe
will be most used will also be available through immuneACCESS, so that users do not need to recreate
them. The data can be exported using dedicated links on the immuneACCESS project page for offline
analysis.
By default the immunoSEQ Analyzer includes many metadata fields that are useful across different
research contexts; Tables 2 and 3 describe the key fields most relevant to this dataset and should be
useful to users interested in understanding the definitions of the different fields. Specifically, Table 2
describes the sample level fields included, whereas Table 3 describes the sequence-level fields. The
amount of metadata available varies by source and participant; we include all available, uncurated

Page 6/29
metadata for each sample in the “sample_tags” field. In almost all cases, these include de-identified
subject IDs, COVID-19 status, age in years, and sex. 
MIRA data
Antigen-specific TCRs were identified using the ‘Multiplex Identification of Antigen-Specific T-Cell
Receptors Assay (MIRA)9,10. MIRA is a high-throughput multiplex tool, enabling the identification of
antigen-specific TCR to large numbers of query antigens (hundreds to thousands at a time and in
parallel) by combining immune assays with T-cell receptor sequencing. We use cell sorting based on the
upregulation of activation markers to separate a population of antigen-specific T cells. This positive
population is sequenced via immunoSEQ, and clonotypes specific to antigen are identified by virtue of
enrichment in the positive population compared to a sample of unenriched or unsorted T cells.
With the goal of identifying SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs, we interrogated T-cell repertoires from both
healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. Input cell types used varied and included PBMCs from healthy
donors or COVID- 19 patients, and naïve T cells from healthy donors. To maximize TCR yield per
experiment, we expanded T cells from both types of input cells. When starting with PBMCs from either
healthy donors or COVID-19 patients, T cells were expanded polyclonally with soluble anti-CD3. When
starting with naïve CD8+ T cells from healthy donors,  T  cells  were  expanded  following  co-culture  with
monocyte-derived  DCs loaded  with  a  pool  of   all peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2.
We used two different MIRA tool approaches: peptide- or transgene-based. Both enable the identification
of antigen-specific TCRs, however the transgene-based approach enables identification of TCRs that are
specific to epitopes encoded and presented by APCs following expression upon transfection of
transgenes. This approach enables us to distinguish the subset of TCRs that respond to endogenously￾presented epitopes rather than those that only respond to exogenously loaded peptides. Binding or
activation following a multimer stain or incubation with peptides is therefore not an indicator of whether
a T cell is specific to an endogenously presented epitope. The underlying assumption for any
immunological assay involving multimers or exogenously loaded peptides is that the epitope being
tested is actually a presented epitope. For well-characterized epitopes this assumption is reasonable,
however when querying large numbers of novel epitopes from a novel virus (SARS-CoV-2, for example)
the risk for false positives (defined as TCRs specific to a never-before tested peptide that was
exogenously loaded), is higher. 
In total, the MIRA dataset includes more than 135,000 high-confidence high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-
specific TCRs. These data are made available as a set of downloadable files “ImmuneCODE MIRA
Release 002.zip”, which can also be accessed through the immuneACCESS project page.
The dataset includes experiments from three MIRA panels. Two of these panels, named “minigene_Set1”
and “minigene_Set2”, targeted large protein sequences intended to narrow down which parts of the
genome generally elicit immune response. The third panel, named “C19_cI”, targeted individual peptides

Page 7/29
or small groups of peptides. Most of the MIRA data included in this dataset corresponds to the C19_cI
panel.
Tables 4 through 9 describe the MIRA data included in the database, as follows: Table 4 (subject￾metadata.csv) includes available metadata for each sample from subjects included in the MIRA
experiments (both in the two minigene and in the peptide panels described above). HLA types are
provided when available. Missing values are generally represented with “N/A”, except for HLA types,
where missing data is represented as an empty string. Note that the metadata contained in this file
relates to the MIRA results, and is distinct from the immunoSEQ-related metadata (I.e. “tags” in the
tables above). Table 5 (orfs.csv) includes the genomic location of the MIRA targets as per GenBank11.
Table 6 (minigene-hits.csv) contains counts of the number of unique TCRs that bound to targets within
the “minigene_Set1” and “minigene_Set2” MIRA panels, while Table 7 (minigene- detail.csv) describes
the identity of the TCRs bound per target for both minigene MIRA panels. Finally, Table 8 (peptide￾hits.csv) contains counts of the number of unique TCRs that bound to targets within the “C19_cI” MIRA
panel, while Table 9 (peptide-detail.csv) describes the identity of the TCRs bound per target for the
C19_cl MIRA panel.
Discussion
To assist in the understanding of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we generated the freely￾available ImmuneCODE database described herein, which includes a dataset of TCR rearrangements
observed in individuals exposed to, infected with or recovered from COVID-19, and describes the ability
of a subset of these TCRs to recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. These data are provided to the scientific
community at large with the goal of contributing to their research efforts to develop novel interventions
to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections. 
In-depth understanding of the T-cell response to the COVID-19 causative agent may improve the
accuracy of existing testing paradigms, and potentially provide an assessment of immunity. These
immune response data may help to solve two of the key challenges we are facing in the current
diagnostic paradigm, namely (1) detection of the virus in infected people who are asymptomatic, and (2)
detection of past infections later than serology and in other cases where antibodies are not present.
Additionally, it is possible that identifying and tracking the T-cell response to the virus may provide
insight as to the severity of a patient’s illness, the length of any post-infection immunity period, the effect
of the infection on individuals with cancer and other conditions conferring higher risk of severity, and the
potential efficacy of vaccines in development.
Online Methods
ImmuneRACE experimental cohort and study approval

Page 8/29
The ImmuneRACE study is a prospective, single group, multi-cohort, exploratory study of unselected
eligible participants exposed to, infected with, or recovering from COVID-19 (NCT04494893).
Participants, aged 18 to 89 years and residing in 24 different geographic areas across the United States,
were consented and enrolled via a virtual study design. Cohorting was based on participant-reported
clinical history following the completion of both a screening survey and study questionnaire.
Cohort 1 included participants exposed within 2 weeks of study entry to someone with a confirmed
COVID-19 diagnosis, either based on positive PCR testing or clinician diagnosis. Cohort 2 participants
included those clinically diagnosed by a physician or with positive laboratory confirmation of active
SARS-CoV-2 infection via PCR testing. Cohort 3 included participants previously diagnosed with COVID￾19 disease who have been deemed recovered based on two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal or
oropharyngeal (NP/OP) PCR tests, clearance by a healthcare professional, or the resolution of symptoms
related to their initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The ImmuneRACE study was approved by Western
Institutional Review Board (WIRB reference number 1-1281891- 1, Protocol ADAP-006). All participants
were consented for sample collection and metadata use via electronic informed consent processes.
Both whole blood and serum and a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab were collected from
participants by trained mobile phlebotomists. Blood samples were shipped frozen or at room
temperature to Adaptive Biotechnologies for processing, including, but not limited to, DNA extraction,
and TCRb analysis via the immunoSEQ Assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA) from DNA
extracted from blood samples (Table 1). NP/OP swabs and serum were sent to Covance/Labcorp for
further testing. An electronic questionnaire was administered to collect information pertaining to the
participant’s medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests performed for COVID-19 disease.
Participants have the option to undergo additional blood draws and questionnaires over 2 months.
Global data collaborations
Whole blood samples were collected in K2EDTA tubes based on each institution’s protocol and
supervised by their respective Institutional Review Board. Samples were stored at the institution and sent
to Adaptive as frozen whole blood, isolated PBMC or DNA extracted from either sample type for TCRb
analysis via the immunoSEQ
Assay (see Table 1). Samples provided by the NIAID were collected under approval by Comitato Etico
Provinciale (protocol NP-4000), by Comitato Etico, Ospedale San Gerardo Monza (protocol COVID￾STORM) and by Comitato Etico Pavia Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia (protocol
20200037677). Whole blood samples from DLS (Discovery Life Sciences, Huntsville, AL) were collected
under Protocol DLS13 for collection of remnant clinical samples. From Bloodworks Northwest (Seattle,
WA), volunteer donors recovered from COVID-19 were consented and collected under the Bloodworks
Research Donor Collection Protocol BT001. Samples were processed for PBMC and donor data reported
by the Biological Products division of Bloodworks NW under standard operating procedures.
Sample analysis

Page 9/29
A subset of the samples were processed for both T-cell receptor variable beta chain sequencing and
MIRA, and another subset was processed only by one of these approaches. For each subject included in
the dataset, SubjectID can be used to determine which assay the samples were processed in.
T-cell receptor variable beta chain sequencing
Immunosequencing of the CDR3 regions of human TCRβ chains was performed using the immunoSEQ
Assay as previously described6,7,8. In brief, extracted genomic DNA was amplified in a bias-controlled
multiplex PCR, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Sequences were collapsed and filtered in order
to identify and quantitate the absolute abundance of each unique TCRβ CDR3 region for further analysis.
Multiplexed Identification of TCR Antigen Specificity (MIRA)
To identify antigen-specific TCRs, T cells derived post-expansion from either of the above input cell types
were used for the MIRA tool. Antigen-specific TCRs were identified as previously described9,10. Briefly, T
cells were incubated overnight with MIRA peptide pools, and the antigen-specific subset was identified
by CD137 upregulation. Following addition of peptides, cells were incubated at 37°C for ~18 hours. At
the end of the incubation, replicate wells of cells were harvested from the culture and pooled and then
stained with antibodies for analysis and sorting by flow cytometry. Cells were then washed and
suspended in PBS containing FBS (2%), 1mM EDTA and 4,6-diamidino- 2-phenylindole (DAPI) for
exclusion of non-viable cells. Cells were acquired and sorted using a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences)
instrument. Sorted antigen-specific (CD3+CD8+CD137+) T cells were pelleted and lysed in RLT Plus
buffer for nucleic acid isolation. Analysis of flow cytometry data files was performed using FlowJo
(Ashland, OR). 
RNA was isolated using AllPrep DNA/RNA mini and/or micro kits, according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Vilo kits (Life Technologies). TCRβ
amplification, sequencing and clonotype determination were performed as described in the ‘T-cell
receptor variable beta chain sequencing’ section above.
MIRA tool design
T-cell populations were exposed to pooled peptides or transgenes in a combinatoric format, similar to
the approach described in reference 10. According to the MIRA panel design, each antigen is
strategically placed in a subset of K unique pools while being omitted from the remaining pools (total
pools = N). This design allows for antigens to be placed into a unique combination of N choose K
occupancies (or also referred to as “addresses”), and allows for increased economies of scale as the
number of replicate pools (N) increases. In order to estimate an empirical false discovery rate and gauge
assay quality, we purposefully left > 40% of the unique occupancies empty to assess the rate at which
are clones are spuriously sorted and detected in K pools with no query antigen present (hereinafter
referred to as invalid TCR associations).
Matching clonotypes to antigens

Page 10/29
T cells were aliquoted into 11 pools, and activated T cells were sorted using T-cell markers after
overnight stimulation, as described previously10. These putative antigen responding cells were set aside
to characterize the T-cell  clonotypes  present  in  each  sorted   pool   using the   immunoSEQ   Assay  
as   described   above.   After immunosequencing, we examined the behavior of T-cell clonotypes by
tracking the read counts of each unique TCRb sequence across each sorted pool. True antigen-specific
clones should be specifically enriched in a unique occupancy pattern that corresponds to the presence
of one of the query antigens in K pools. We have reported on methods to assign antigen specificity to
TCR clonotypes previously12; in addition we also developed a non-parametric Bayesian model to
compute the posterior probability that a given clonotype is antigen specific. This model uses the
available read counts of TCRs to estimate a mean-variance relationship within a given experiment and as
well as the probability that a clone will have zero read counts due to incomplete sampling of low
frequency clones. Together, this model takes the observed read counts of a clonotype across all N pools
and estimates the posterior probability of a clone responding to all possible N choose K addresses and
an additional hypothesis that a clone is activated in all pools (truly activated, but no specific to any of our
query antigens). To define antigen specific clones, we identified TCR clonotypes assigned to a query
antigen from this model with a posterior probability >= 0.9.

Description
Rearrangement rearrangement string
A     particular     nucleotide    sequence
generated through V(D)J recombination,
as
detected by the immunoSEQ assay.
Extended
Rearrangement
extended_rearrangement string
The full length TCR imputed via algorithm
for the Rearrangement; includes the full
CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 region.
Bioidentity bio_identity string
T cell bioidentity refers to the overall
protein sequence of a T cell receptor.
This is defined as the identified V gene,
the amino acid sequence of the CDR3
region and the identified J gene. Two
rearrangements with the same bioidentity
would be expected to demonstrate the
same binding and activation behavior.
