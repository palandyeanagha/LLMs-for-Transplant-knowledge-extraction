INTRODUCTION
The technological advances in cochlear implants 
and processing strategies have enabled subjects affected 
by severe to profound hearing loss to hear sounds and 
recognize speech in various different degrees1
. The varia￾bility of hearing outcomes in subjects with post-lingual 
deafness has been significant, and the most relevant factors 
to predict good outcome are short period of pre-implant 
hearing deprivation and some residual hearing2
. That is 
why cochlear implant indications have been extended to 
include an ever larger population1
.
Several studies have been published within the last 
few years comparing the hearing outcomes obtained by 
severe and profound hearing loss patients using conven￾tional hearing aids or cochlear implants3
. This paper aims 
to look into the groups of post-lingual deafness patients to 
find where cochlear implants have yielded better outcomes 
than conventional hearing aids, having papers published 
in the literature as reference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a systematic review carried out upon the 
medical literature after a search conducted on June of 
2010, including papers written in Portuguese, English 
and Spanish. The search for relevant references was done 
on databases SciELO, Cochrane, MEDLINE, and LILACS-
-BIREME. The publications selected for review were rated 
as A or B on evidence strength on the day of the review. 
Their authors analyzed and compared hearing aids and 
cochlear implants in populations of post-lingually deaf 
patients. The following search terms (keywords and delimi￾ters) were used: cochlear implants/cochlear implantation; 
hearing aid; therapy; prognosis; comparative study and the 
corresponding translated terms in various combinations.
Some of the included studies might be biased, as 
they were written by cochlear implant manufacturers4-6.
RESULTS
Eleven out of the 2,169 papers searched were found 
to be pertinent to the topic and were rated B for evidence 
strength (four were rated 2b1,7-9 and seven 2c2-6,10,11). No A￾rated publications were found. Six of the selected studies 
were prospective cohort trials, four were cross-sectional 
studies and one was a clinical trial (Table 1).

a standardized procedure, was considered as a useful 
tool in advising and selecting patients for cochlear im￾plant use.
Snik et al.10, using speech perception tests, assessed 
seven children users of cochlear implants and another 
eleven who used conventional hearing aids to conclude 
that the scores on the presented phonemes were similar 
for both groups.
In 2001, a study by MED-EL Ltda.4 (Innsbruck, 
Austria) looked at speech perception and compared pre￾implantation scores of conventional hearing aid users to 
their scores six months after they started using cochlear 
implants. The authors carried out two series of subgroup 
analyses: pre and post-lingually deaf; and (2) time of hear￾ing loss in post-lingually deaf patients (mean 25 years of 
age). The mean difference (pre/post) for post-lingually deaf 
patients was 62% in silent environments, and patients with 
less than 25 years of hearing loss yielded greater benefits 
from cochlear implants than those who had experienced 
hearing loss for over 25 years (71% vs. 53% respectively). 
In noisy environments, post-lingually deaf patients with 25 
years or less of hearing loss also performed better.
Ching et al.1
 observed 21 adult patients wearing co￾chlear implants Nucleus 22 (Cochlear Ltd., Lane Cove, Aus￾tralia) or Nucleus 24 (Cochlear Ltd.). Twelve patients made 
combined use of conventional hearing aids and cochlear 
implants, while nine did not use conventional hearing aids 
after implantation. The combined use of cochlear implant 
and hearing aid was compared to cochlear implant or con￾ventional hearing aids alone. Patients wearing both devices 
performed significantly better on speech tests, on functional 
performance questionnaires, and made many fewer mistakes 
as they had to locate a sound source when compared to 
patients wearing either cochlear implants or conventional 
hearing aids. The authors used the Bamford-Kowal-Bench 
(BKB) Sentence Test in noisy situations to measure speech 
perception and showed a significant benefit for cochlear 
implant users (CI user mean score was 39, while conven￾tional hearing aid users’ was 2, p < 0.001).
Mo et al.2 evaluated 134 patients (75 CI users and 59 
hearing aid users) aged between 19 and 85 years of age 
using the Performance Inventory for Profound and Severe 
Loss. The CI group scored better (p < 0.01) on Visual Cues 
(USV), Intensity (INT), Response to Auditory Failure (RAF). 
No significant difference was found on Environmental 
Sounds (ES), Visual Cues (USNV) and Personal (PER). Note 
that CI patients had mean preoperative hearing in their best 
ears of 113 dB. On the other hand, conventional hearing 
aid users had mean hearing of 82 dB. Nevertheless, at the 
end of the study the cochlear implant group had better 
social hearing capabilities.
Mo et al.3
 compared 84 adult users of cochlear 
implants to three groups of severe/profound hearing loss 
patients: 19 patients accepted for implantation, but on 
whom surgery was not performed (subgroup non-CI-A); 
16 candidates to CI whose hearing loss was not severe 
enough for them to use cochlear implants (subgroup 
non-CI-B); and 60 conventional hearing aid users. Five 
questionnaires were applied: Patient Quality of Life Form 
(PQLF), Index Relative Questionnaire Form (IRQF), Short 
Form 36 (SF-36), Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-25) 
and Performance Inventory for Profound and Severe Loss 
(PIPSL). The most significant differences were observed 
on quality-of-life and degree of depression and anxiety 
(HSCL-25) between the groups of cochlear implant patients 
and subgroup non-CI-A. Cochlear implant patients had 
significantly less depression and anxiety than their non￾implanted counterparts. The only significant difference 
between cochlear implant and conventional hearing aid 
users was elicited on questionnaire SF-36, in which the 
CI group scored better.
Hamzavi et al.7
 measured speech perception in 
severe/profound hearing loss patients before implantation 
and 12 months into follow-up in cochlear implant and con￾ventional hearing aid users. The authors also looked into 
alterations between 12 and 36 months after implantation 
on silent and noisy conditions using the Hochmair, Schultz 
and Moser (HSM) sentence test. They found that cochlear 
implant patients had a mean improvement of 90% on their 
pre/post-implantation test scores, while conventional hear￾ing aid users improved by 37%. Monosyllabic word test 
scores improved by 43% for CI users and by 19% for con￾ventional hearing aid users. In two years, the HSM scores 
in silent conditions improved by 16% for CI users and by 
0% for conventional hearing aid users. In noisy conditions, 
conventional hearing aid users failed to show improvement, 
whereas CI users improved on all noise levels.
In 2004, the United Kingdom Cochlear Implant Study 
Group5 (UKCISG) studied 316 patients with severe/profound 
hearing loss who wore either conventional hearing aids 
or cochlear implants. The authors assessed the cost for 
the United Kingdom National Health Service to provide 
and maintain cochlear implants, as estimated by the Mark 
III Health Utilities Index. The study showed acceptable 
cost-effectiveness for cochlear implantation in all assessed 
patients. It further indicated median cost-effectiveness for 
cochlear implants in patients affected by hearing loss for 
over 30 years and who were then using conventional hear￾ing aids. Additionally, age was a factor that worsened CI 
cost-effectiveness, once it is estimated that older individuals 
have fewer years of life ahead of them.
On that same UKCISG6
 cohort, 84 patients were 
tested for speech perception using the Bamford-Kowal￾Bench (BKB) Sentence Test and the City University New 
York (CUNY) Sentence Test before implantation and nine 
months since in patients with profound hearing loss. Re￾sults have shown improved scores on both measurements 
nine months after surgery [BKB: Marginal hearing aid 
users (MHU) = 44.0 (95% IC 37-51); AVGN: MHU = 31.0 
(95% IC 26-37)].

According to Poissant et al.8
, there is no significant 
difference in the ability to understand speech in silent or 
noisy conditions between younger and older cochlear 
implant users (p<0.05). The author observed fewer cases 
of depression among older cochlear implant users and 
of loneliness in both older and younger subjects. Older 
cochlear implant users were not more depressed or lonely 
than their counterparts with mild to moderate hearing loss 
who used conventional hearing aids.
Assuming that conventional hearing aid users would 
have better musical perception skills than cochlear implant 
individuals, Looi et al.11 looked into the performance of 
subjects with similar levels of hearing loss who used either 
of the devices. The results for both groups were nearly 
identical for rhythm tests, with the conventional hearing 
aid group marginally outperforming the cochlear implant 
group in pitch and melody tests. Nonetheless, there was 
no difference between the groups in their ability to identify 
musical instruments or ensembles.
DISCUSSION
Hearing loss is a problem of significant prevalence 
in the population that affects one’s personality and social￾ization, possibly leading to isolation and reclusion. Hearing 
test results of cochlear implant patients vary. Some can 
communicate without the aid of orofacial reading and even 
talk on the phone, while others can only hear sounds from 
the environment, alarm buzzers or beepers, and improve 
their lip reading skills.
Several changes are taking place as to how cochlear 
implant candidates are chosen, often driven the increasingly 
global and dynamic pace of knowledge acquisition. Patients 
with low frequency residual hearing in the implanted ear 
can undergo less traumatic procedures, avoid endoco￾chlear trauma, and use shorter or perimodiolar electrode 
bundles, thus allowing them to preserve their hearing at 
lower frequencies and even use conventional hearing aids 
and cochlear implants in a combined fashion on one ear.
Uma questão importante é a comprovação cien￾tífica de que o IC pode trazer benefícios superiores aos 
das próteses auditivas convencionais, que justifiquem o 
procedimento cirúrgico, em termos de riscos operatórios 
e encargos psicossociais e financeiros ao paciente, sua 
família e ao sistema de saúde. Thus, cochlear implant 
candidates must be chosen as a function of observed 
outcomes and their predictive factors.
According to the Brazilian Association of Otorhino￾laryngology, adolescents aged 12 and over and adults with 
post-lingual deafness are candidates for unilateral or bilateral 
cochlear implants if they meet the following criteria: severe 
or profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss; open form 
sentence recognition of 50% or less; hearing aids on both 
ears and patient adequately motivated to use cochlear 
implants and undergo speech and hearing rehabilitation.
After a broad systematic review, we have been able 
to find methodologically distinct studies, mainly when 
outcomes are analyzed. However, they make it clear that 
cochlear implants are superior when compared to conven￾tional hearing aids in several aspects. Some studies, such 
as the UKCISG5 cohort and the paper by Hamzavi et al.7
, 
compared patients in an ideal form while they were using 
hearing aids and later as they receive cochlear implants, 
using the same tests pre and postoperatively.
It has been found that cochlear implants allow for 
improvements in speech understanding and on quality￾of-life, aside from significantly easing one’s insertion into 
the social and professional worlds and reducing the onset 
of depression and feelings of loneliness1,3,4,6-8,10. Shorter 
hearing deprivation time has been singled out as a factor 
connected to better outcomes4,6.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of the studies included in this sys￾tematic review has enabled us to conclude that cochlear 
implants allow for better performance in post-lingually 
deaf patients when compared to conventional hearing aids 
as verified by audiological tests, improved quality-of-life, 
and overall procedure cost-effectiveness.
