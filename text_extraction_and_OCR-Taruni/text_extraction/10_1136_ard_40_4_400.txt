Search for cross-reactivity between HLA B27
and Klebsiella pnetumoniae
J. R. ARCHER
From the Immunology Section, Bone and Joint Research Unit, London Hospital Medical College
SUMMARY HLA B27 is associated with a number of forms of arthritis, including ankylosing
spondylitis. It has been suggested that the disease is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and that the
bacterium evokes an odd immune response because it cross-reacts with HLA B27. This proposed
cross-reactivity was investigated in a number of ways. The results consistently failed to confirm
evidence from cross reaction, even in antisera with activity against both HLA B27-positive lympho￾cytes and klebsiella. It is suggested that the anomalous anti-klebsiella response of rabbits immunised
with pools of HLA B27-positive leucocytes may be caused by antigenic bacterial fragments on the
cells of infected individuals.
HLA B27 is associated with a number of forms of
arthritis-notably ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's
syndrome. Shigella flexneri, Yersinia entercolitica,
Brucella abortus, and Salmonella typhimurium have
all been implicated in triggering rheumatic attacks.' 2
The Ebringers and their colleagues have also
suggested that many London area cases of ankylosing
spondylitis are started by Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Evidence for this has come in 3 forms. Welsh et al.,3
working on the hypothesis that disease association
with HLA haplotypes was caused by antigenic cross￾reactions between HLA and infective agents, tried to
identify the agent by immunising rabbits with B27
positive cells and looking for antibacterial agglu￾tinins. They found that rabbits developed antibodies
against Yersinia enterocolitica and Klebsiella pneu￾moniae. It has further been reported -6 that faecal
carriage of klebsiella was higher in patients with
active disease, or who were about to become active,
than it was in nonspondylitic controls or patients in
whom the disease was quiescent (although this result
has been disputed7). More recently an Australian
group8 has shown that rabbit antisera to some strains
of K. pneumoniae are cytotoxic for cells from certain
patients but not against healthy B27 positive controls.
If the Ebringer cross-reactive hypothesis is
correct, the following propositions should hold:
(a) Cross-reactive rabbit anti-B27 lymphocyte serum

should have B27 specificity. (b) It should be possible
to remove anti-klebsiella activity from this serum by
absorption with B27-positive cells. (c) Cross-reactive
antigen should be demonstrable on the lymphocytes
of patients with inactive disease as well as active
spondylitis sufferers. (d) Rabbit anti-K. pneumoniae
serum should have greater reactivity with B27-
positive than B27-negative cells.
This paper describes attempts to confirm these
postulates and failure to find evidence for any of
them.
An alternative explanation is needed for the high
anti-klebsiella activity of some anti-B27 lymphocyte
sera.
Materials and methods
Animals. Rabbits for immunisation were held in the
animal house of G. D. Searle and Co, High
Wycombe.
Bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae MX100, originally
isolated from an ankylosing spondylitis patient at the
Middlesex Hospital by Dr R. W. Ebringer and
Mrs D. R. Cawdell, was obtained from Dr Ebringer
and freeze-dried in gelatin capsules on arrival at the
laboratory.
Lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro￾bably contained capsular polysaccharide as well as
endotoxin. It was extracted by the phenol-water
method of Westphal et al.9 from bacteria which
had been grown on nutrient agar (Oxoid) and washed
3 times with saline. Further purification was carried

out by precipitation with 5 volumes of ethanol. It
was finally dialysed against distilled water to remove
the last traces of phenol. The 'LPS' could not be
precipitated by high-speed centrifugation at neutral
pH but formed a heavy flocculent precipitate on
addition of a few drops of acetic acid. The final
product contained uronic acid (7% by the Dische
carbazole technique) and methyl pentose (10-5%
by the method of Dische and Shettles).10
Haemagglutination. Sheep red blood cells in
Alsever's solution were washed 3 times in phosphate
buffered saline (Dulbecco's A), resuspended at a
concentration of 4 %, and mixed with an equal
volume of LPS at 40 ,g/ml. They were incubated at
370C for 1 hour with occasional gentle shaking and
washed 3 times for 10 minutes at 200 g. Aliquots
(20 >1l) were added to doubling dilutions of anti￾serum (20 V.1) in Cooke U-welled microtitre trays.
Trays were incubated at 370C for 1 hour and checked
for evidence of haemagglutination after storing
overnight at 40C.
Tissue culture cells. Human B cells (BRI 8-HLA
A1, A2, B8, B13) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Flow)
containing 5 % pig serum by Dr J. Birch in the cell
culture unit of G. D. Searle and Co, High Wycombe.
Lymphocytes. Unless otherwise stated, lympho￾cytes were obtained from volunteers in the HLA
typing panel of G. D. Searle and Co. Cells for
cytotoxicity testing or absorption were obtained
from heparinised blood by the Ficoll-Triosil method
of B6yum.11
Immunisations. Two rabbit antisera3 against pools
of HLA B27 positive lymphocytes were obtained
from Dr A. Ebringer. Serum A was from a rabbit
immunised with a pool of frozen lymphocytes from
a panel of 83 normal B27-positive individuals. It had
an antilymphocyte activity of about 1/1000 and
anti-Klebsiella haemagglutination activity of 1/128.
Serum B came from a rabbit immunised with cells
from 3 patients who appeared to be homozygous for
B27, and had a haemagglutinating titre of 1/512.
Other rabbits were immunised either intravenously
or subcutaneously with lymphocytes from individual
human donors-10 ml blood at fortnightly intervals.
Klebsiella for immunisation were grown over￾night on McConkey or nutrient agar (Oxoid) and
washed 3 times with saline. They were killed with
either alcohol (96%) or formalin and rewashed 3
times in saline. Rabbits were injected with an
initial 106 bacteria followed by doses of 108 at
fortnightly intervals. Two rabbits were immunised
intra-peritoneally and one intravenously with
formalin-killed bacteria, and two intravenously
with alcohol-killed bacteria. Two further
antisera made by subcutaneous injection with
ultraviolet-light killed bacteria were obtained from
Dr A. Ebringer.
Cytotoxicity tests. Cells for test (lymphocytes
from 10 ml blood or cultured cells) were washed 3
times in HEPES buffered Eagles basal essential
medium (Flow) containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum (10 HBEM), resuspended in 2
drops of medium, and mixed with 5 Fd 51Cr (20
V.Ci/ml) (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham). After
incubation at 370C for 90 minutes the cells were
washed 5 times in 10 HBEM and resuspended at
1 x 105/ml. Test serum (20 ,tl) was titrated in
doubling dilutions in a V-welled microtitre tray.
Equal volumes of cells and pretitrated rabbit
complement were added, and the mixture was
incubated for a further 1 hour before further
reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA in
saline and the amount of 51Cr released was measured.
Absorption. Antiserum for absorption with BRI 8
cells was diluted 1/3 with HBEM. Cells were washed
3 times in 10 HBEM and divided in 3 before the
final wash. Antiserum (1 ml) was added to the
pellet in the first tube (containing approximately
3 x 108 cells) absorbed at 4°C on a rocking platform,
centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes, and then re￾absorbed twice more. The final supernatant was
centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 hour, and the absorbed
serum was stored at -200C in 100 [LI aliquots.
Human lymphocytes for absorption were obtained
from 20 ml of fresh heparinised blood on Ficoll￾Triosil. Antiserum diluted to 1/20 was added to
approximately 3 x 106 cells. After a single absorp￾tion cells were centrifuged out at 200 g and the
supernatants tested.
Results
B27 SPECIFICITY IN 'CROSS-REACTIVE' SERA
Rabbit anti-pooled B27 cell serum A, with an anti￾klebsiella haemagglutination titre of 1/128, was
absorbed with BRI 8 cells and tested for cytotoxicity
against normal B27-positive and negative lympho￾cytes. In the course of 4 separate absorption experi￾ments, with target cells from 3 B27-positive and 3
negative donors, no consistent difference was found
in reactions against the 2 groups of cells. We con￾cluded that there was no demonstrable specific anti￾B27 cytotoxic antibody in the rabbit anti-B27
lymphocyte serum.

intervals intravenously for 1 year and 2 subcu￾taneously over a period of 4 months. The animals
were bled regularly to look for anti-klebsiella
activity but none was found.
We concluded that immunogenic klebsiella-like
antigen was not invariably present in HLA B27-
positive cells. It seemed more likely either that the
original anti-klebsiella activity in sera A and B was
an artefact or that antigen is present only sporadic￾ally.

tests were carried out with cells from a total of 3
patients, 2 healthy B27-positive individuals, and 4
healthy B27-negative controls. Typical results of
cytotoxicity tests on these sera are shown in Fig. 1.
The same samples were tested for klebsiella
haemagglutinating activity before and after absorp￾tion. In each case, whether the absorption was by
cells from patients or from controls, the titre fell
from 1/512 to 1/320.
The results are unsatisfactory because it was not
possible to obtain enough lymphocytes to carry out
a complete absorption on the serum. It is clear,
however, that an absorption which removed 90%
of the antilymphocyte activity from the serum had
only a slight nonspecific effect on its anti-klebsiella
activity, and it seems most likely that the anti￾human and anti-klebsiella activities are on separate
molecules.
IMMUNISATION WITH CELLS FROM
B27-POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS
Cells from a 34-year-old male (HLA Al, All, B44,
B27) who claimed that he had been healthy for many
years were used to immunise 3 rabbits at fortnightly
CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF ANTI￾KLEBSIELLA SERA
Eight rabbit anti-klebsiella MX100 sera were tested
for cytotoxicity reactions against a panel of normal
and B27-positive cells. A few tests showed slightly
high 51Cr release at the greatest antiserum concentra￾tion, but this could be rapidly titrated out. Table 1
shows the number of tests on B27-positive and
negative normal cells giving a release of more than
20% in one of the first 2 wells of the titrations.
(Background and full release are approximately
10% and 70% respectively). Cells from a total of 12
B27-positive (including 3 patients), and 11 B27-
negative individuals were used. The healthy B27-
positive donors included a symptom-free person who
had had Reiter's syndrome diagnosed 2 years
previously. Cells from this person did not differ
significantly from the others. There was clearly no
reaction between anti-klebsiella serum and the cells
of the healthy individuals tested, even though at
least 1 appeared to carry the genetic susceptibility
to HLA B27-associated arthritis.
Discussion
This paper describes how we attempted and failed to
find evidence for cross-reaction between HLA B27
and Klebsiella pneumoniae MX100 by a number of
conventional tests, many using the original sera and
bacterial strain used to define the cross-reaction. It
can always be argued, with negative results, that the
experimental model was not sufficiently sensitive to
detect the true result. However, I think it unlikely
that the 'cross-reaction' we were seeking would
have been very difficult to detect. The rabbit anti￾lymphocyte sera had substantial anti-klebsiella
titres by the haemagglutination assay ('normal' sera

tested in the same system seldom had titres greater
than 1/20 (Welsh, unpublished)). In spite of this our
complement-dependent cytotoxic assay could detect
no specific B27 activity in what should have been the
same population of antibodies directed against the
homologous system. Although a few examples are
reported of situations in which antibody is more
potent against a cross-reactive than a homologous
antigen (original antigenic sin,12 13 heteroclitic anti￾bodies14), these generally involve a primary response,
and the effect is reduced on further immunisation: the
rabbit sera here described are hyperimmune.
The cross-reactive hypothesis poses chemical
difficulties. HLA antigens are heat-labile proteins.
That they should cross-react with antigens extracted
from a hot phenol soup is implausible.
It could be argued that if association of suscepti￾bility to arthritis with HLA B27 is caused by a gene
in close linkage disequilibrium, and not B27 itself,
our panel of nine 'normal' B27 individuals lacked
the appropriate gene. This also seems unlikely. The
panel included at least 1 individual with a history of
B27-associated arthritis.
If the high anti-klebsiella titre of anti-B27 pooled
lymphocytes is accepted as genuine, the simplest
explanation of these results is that klebsiella￾reactive antigen is found on lymphocytes of B27-
positive persons only sporadically. This agrees with
the observation of Seager et al.8 that anti-klebsiella
serum reacts only with lymphocytes from certain
patients with ankylosing spondylitis and not with
cells from normal B27-positive controls. The most
likely source of antigen is klebsiella, and the activity
of the Ebringer sera is attributable to inclusion of
lymphocytes from affected individuals. On this
hypothesis HLA B27 acts as a marker for a process￾ing defect in the cells of certain individuals which
makes their leucocytes pick up certain Gram￾negative bacterial antigens but fail properly to
handle them (perhaps to pass them to another cell to
elicit an immune response). Cells carrying antigen
would act as immunogens when injected into rabbits
in Ebringer's system, or act as targets for cytotoxic
reactions in the experiments of the Sydney group.8 15
How the reaction of bacterial products with HLA
antigens leads to arthritis is still a matter for
speculation.
Most of the experimental data in this paper were obtained
by Miss C. J. R. Welsh, and form part of her PhD thesis
submitted to the University of London. It is a pleasure to
thank her for her intelligent and skilful collaboration, as well
as access to her data. I would also like to thank Dr A.
Ebringer and Dr R. W. Ebringer for the supply of rabbit
antisera and their 'cross-reactive' strain of klebsiella.
