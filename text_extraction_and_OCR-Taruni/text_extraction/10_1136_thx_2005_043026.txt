Abstract
Background: Obliterative bronchiolitis in chronic rejection of lung
allografts is characterised by airway epithelial damage and fibrosis.
The process whereby normal epithelium is lost and replaced by
fibroblastic scar tissue is poorly understood, but recent findings
suggest that epithelial cells can become fibroblasts through
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is hypothesised that
EMT occurs in lung allografts and plays a potential role in airway
remodelling.
Methods: Sixteen stable lung transplant recipients underwent
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial
biopsies, and bronchial brushings. Biopsy sections were stained for
the fibroblast marker S100A4. Brushings were cultured on collagen,
stained with anti-S100A4, and examined for further EMT markers
including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) zymographic activity
and epithelial invasion through collagen coated filters.
Results: A median 15% (0–48%) of the biopsy epithelium stained
for S100A4 in stable lung transplant recipients and MMP-7 co-
localisation was observed. In non-stimulated epithelial cultures
from lung allografts, S100A4 staining was identified with MMP-2
and MMP-9 production and zymographic activity. MMP total


protein and activity was increased following stimulation with
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Non-stimulated transplant
epithelial cells were invasive and penetration of collagen coated
filters increased following TGF-β1 stimulation.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence of EMT markers in lung
allografts of patients without loss of lung function. The EMT process
may represent a final common pathway following injury in more
common diseases characterised by airway remodelling.
