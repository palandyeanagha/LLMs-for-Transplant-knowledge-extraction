Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative therapy
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastases
when resection cannot be performed or, in the case of
HCC, when transplant cannot be performed in a timely
enough manner to avoid the risk of dropping off the trans￾plant list. RFA has the advantage of being a relatively low-risk
minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of focal liver
tumors. In this review article we discuss the science, com￾plications, and imaging follow-up after RFA, as well as its
indications.
Technique
The goal of RFA is to completely destroy a tumor without
damaging the surrounding liver tissue by inducing thermal
injury to the tissue through electromagnetic energy deposi￾tion. In the most common configuration of clinical RFA,
monopolar RFA, the patient is a part of a closed-loop circuit
that includes an RF generator, a needle electrode, and a large
dispersive electrode (grounding pads).1 This creates an alter￾nating electric field within the tissue that causes agitation of
the ions present in the target tissue that surrounds the
electrode, resulting in frictional heat around the electrode.2
The discrepancy between the small surface area of the needle
electrode and the large area of the grounding pads causes
the generated heat to be focused and concentrated around the
needle electrode while the grounding pads disperse the
energy over a larger area to avoid skin burns.3
Permanent tissue destruction occurs at temperatures of
45°C. With temperatures from 46°C to 60°C, irreversible
cellular damage is produced only after relatively longer periods
of exposure; in contrast, temperatures between 60°C and 100°C
cause almost instantaneous protein coagulation with irrevers￾ible damage to mitochondria and cytosolic cell enzymes. When
temperatures exceed 100°C, tissue fluids undergo boiling,
vaporization, and ultimately carbonization.3 Vaporization,
which occurs when tissues are heated to >100 to 110°C,

Abstract Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma
and liver metastases when resection cannot be performed or, in the case of hepatocel￾lular carcinoma, when transplant cannot be performed in a timely enough manner to
avoid the risk of dropping off the transplant list. RFA has the advantage of being a
relatively low-risk minimally invasive procedure used in the treatment of focal liver
tumors. This review article discusses the current evidence supporting RFA of liver
tumors, as well as the indications, complications, and follow-up algorithms used after
RFA.

produces significant gas that both serves as an insulator and
retards the ability to effectively establish a RF field.1 Therefore,
the key aim of RFA is to achieve and maintain a 50 to 100°C
temperature range throughout the entire target volume.
Another important factor that affects the success of RFA is
the ability to ablate all viable tumor tissue and an adequate
tumor-free margin. To achieve rates of local tumor recurrence
with RFA that are comparable with those obtained by hepatic
resection, a 360-degree 1-cm-thick tumor-free margin
around each tumor should be obtained, which may require
multiple overlapping ablations.4 Thus the target diameter of
an ablation must be 2 cm larger than the diameter of the
tumor that undergoes treatment (►Fig. 1).2 Inadequate abla￾tion can be due either to heterogeneity of tissue composition,
by which differences in tumor density, including fibrosis and
calcification, alter electrical and thermal conductance, and
blood flow, by which perfusion-mediated tissue cooling
(vascular flow) reduces the extent of thermally induced
coagulation.1
RFA is usually performed following the administration of
intravenous sedation and analgesia with standard cardiac,
blood pressure, and oxygen monitoring. Targeting of the
lesion can be performed with ultrasound, computed tomog￾raphy (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending
on operator preference and the local availability of dedicated
equipment.
Complications
RFA is a safe procedure with very low rates of death and major
complications. Complications include abdominal hemor￾rhage (►Fig. 2), hepatic abscess, pleural effusion, hepatic
infarction, bronchobiliary fistula, bile peritonitis, biloma,
hemobilia, thrombosis of vessels in the hepatic venous sys￾tem, skin burn, tumor seeding, and perforation of the stom￾ach, intestine, or diaphragm.
In a multicenter study by Koda et al on 16,346 treated
nodules in 13,283 patients, 579 complications (3.5%) were
observed; five patients (0.04%) died due to complications of
RFA.5 A total of 276 hepatic injuries (1.69%) occurred includ￾ing 75 liver infarctions (0.469%) and 32 liver abscesses
(0.19%), 110 bile duct injuries (0.67%), and 37 bilomas
(0.23%). Other hepatic injuries included portal thrombosis,
refractory ascites, and hepatic failure.5 Another study found

that bilomas occurred in 3.3% of cases (109 of 3284) following
RFA but only one required percutaneous drainage.6 One study
demonstrated that intraoperative central bile duct cooling
could prevent biliary complications in patients undergoing
RFA for periductal HCC.7 Other studies have found that intra￾ductal chilled saline perfusion through a nasobiliary tube was
a potential intervention to prevent biliary injury by percuta￾neous RFA.8,9 These are small studies, and this practice is not
yet widespread.
Koda et al found that a total of 113 extrahepatic organ
injures occurred (0.69%) including 2 patients with cardiac
tamponade, 9 cases of pneumothorax (►Fig. 3) (0.06%), 9
gastrointestinal injuries, 5 gallbladder injuries, 8 diaphrag￾matic injuries, 43 refractory pleural effusions, and 32 skin
burns.5 Most of the extrahepatic complications due to ther￾mal damage may be prevented by artificial ascites or pleural
effusion, which creates a space between the tumor and
adjacent organs such as the abdominal wall, diaphragm,
gastrointestinal tract, or gallbladder (►Fig. 4).10–12 Artificial
ascites, however, poses a theoretical risk of a heat-sink effect
that may decrease the effectiveness of the ablation. This risk
was not proven in a study on percutaneous RFA of hepatic
tumors abutting the diaphragm.13
Koda et al also found tumor seeding at the needle tract in
seven cases (0.04%) and eight cases of peritoneal dissemina￾tion (0.05%),5 which was significantly lower than the 12%
reported in an earlier study.14 A recent literature review
found that the risk of seeding was 0.61% (0 to 5.56%) for
RFA without biopsy and 0.95% (0 to 12.5%) for RFA with
biopsy.15 Subcapsular location and poor differentiation
have been associated with an increased risk of seeding.14
Another major drawback of RFA is the high rate of disease
recurrence after treatment (►Figs. 5 and 6). A few studies,
predominantly from early experiences with RFA, found a
statistically significantly shorter recurrence-free interval in
patients with subcapsular tumors compared with nonsub￾capsular tumors following RFA.16–18 However, more recent
studies have found that the expected morbidity and local
tumor progression in patients with subcapsular liver tumors
who undergo percutaneous RFA was comparable with those
in patients with nonsubcapsular tumors.19,20 Another early
study found that the presence of vessels at least 3 mm in size
contiguous to the hepatic tumors is a strong independent
predictor of incomplete tumor destruction by RFA.21 Again, a
more recent study found that RFA was an effective procedure,
even for high-risk tumors adjacent to large blood vessels.22
Follow-Up After Ablation
Because tumor is treated in situ, imaging follow-up is neces￾sary to assess treatment response. Protocols vary among
institutions, but ongoing surveillance is performed with
shorter intervals initially. At our institution, contrast-en￾hanced imaging with CT or MRI (with subtraction images)
is performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment and at
6-month intervals thereafter. On the initial follow-up imag￾ing, successful ablation is seen as a nonenhancing area with or
without an enhancing rim. The enhancing rim that may be
observed along the periphery of the ablation zone appears to
be a relatively concentric, symmetrical, and uniform process
in an area with smooth inner margins and without nodularity
(►Fig. 4).23 Benign peri-ablation enhancement must be dif￾ferentiated from irregular peripheral enhancement due to
residual tumor that occurs at the treatment margin. Ablation
site recurrence can present as focal enhancing lesions within
or around the ablation zone or as an overall increase in the
size of the ablation zone.24
Primary Liver Tumors
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
HCC is well suited to treatment with locoregional therapy
because it has a tendency to stay within the liver, with distant
metastasis generally occurring late. RFA plays a role in

multiple situations: resectable HCC, unresectable HCC, as a
bridge to transplant, and in recurrent HCC.
Resectable HCC
Prior to the routine use of liver transplant, surgical resection
was the only modality for curative treatment of HCC. Based on
the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) treatment strategy,
resection is considered the first treatment option for early￾stage patients (single tumor <2 cm).25 A recent study, how￾ever, reported that the efficacy and safety of percutaneous
RFA were better than those of surgical resection with HCC
measuring 2 cm, especially those with central HCC.26 A
study comparing resection or RFA in patients with a solitary
HCC <5 cm reported 1- and 4-year overall survival rates after
percutaneous RFA and surgery of 96%, 68%, and 93%, 64%,
respectively.27 The corresponding disease-free survival rates
were 86%, 46%, and 87%, 52%, respectively.27 A randomized
trail comparing RFA and surgical resection for HCC conform￾ing to the Milan criteria reported a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year
overall survival rates for the RFA group and the resection
group of 87%, 77%, 70%, 66%, 55%, and 98%, 97%, 92%, 83%, 76%,
respectively.28 The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence
rates were 17%, 38%, 50%, 59%, and 63% for the RFA group and
12%, 23%, 34%, 39%, and 42% for the resection group.28
Unresectable HCC
A retrospective study comparing the outcome of RFA and
trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with
unresectable HCC found that the 1- and 2-year overall sur￾vival rates were 82% and 72%, respectively, in the RFA group
and 80% and 58%, respectively, in the TACE group.29 A second
study found that the overall recurrence-free rate was signifi￾cantly higher in the RFA group than in the TACE group: The
2-year local recurrence-free rates in the RFA and TACE groups
were 60% and 49%, respectively.30 A meta-analysis of five
randomized controlled trials comparing RFA and percutane￾ous ethanol injection (PEI) demonstrated that patients
treated with RFA had better 1- and 3-year overall survival

rates than those treated with PEI.31 Disease recurrence rates
at the ablation site were also significantly lower in the RFA
group than in the PEI group (2 to 14% versus 11 to 35%).31 The
combination of RFA with other locoregional treatments such
as PEI or TACE has been shown to result in better survival and
lower recurrence rates than RFA alone.32–34
Bridge to Transplant
The concept of liver transplant as the treatment of HCC is
evolving. According to the Milan criteria, patients with a large
single (5 cm) or multiple tumors (fewer than three and 3 cm
in size) are eligible for transplantation (►Fig. 2). However,
because of the discrepancy between the increasing demand
and the inadequate supply of liver from deceased donors, many
potential recipients either die before an organ becomes avail￾able or drop off the transplant waiting list because of tumor
progression. RFA and other locoregional treatments, such as
TACE and PEI, have an emerging role to play as bridging
interventions. Using the UNOS inclusion criteria, a study found
that the respective dropout probabilities at 6, 12, and
18 months would have been 11.0%, 57.4%, and 68.7%, respec￾tively.35 In comparison, a study that used multimodality abla￾tive techniques, such as RFA, TACE, ethyl alcohol ablation, or a
combination of techniques as a bridge for transplantation,
found a dropout rate of 0%, 0%, and 6% at 6, 12, and 24 months
using the same exclusion criteria.36 The role of RFA alone as a
bridge to transplantation was specifically addressed in two
studies. One study reported a dropout rate of 14% after a
waiting time of 11.9 months,37 and the other a rate of 5.8%
after a mean waiting time of 12.7 months.38
Recurrent HCC
Recurrent HCC occurs in 50 to 80% of patients at 5 years after
resection, with the majority occurring within 2 years after
resection.39 RFA has been increasingly used in these patients,
with cohort studies reporting the 5-year overall survival rate
ranging from 18 to 52%.39
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
Hepatic resection is the only curative treatment option for
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; however, most patients are
not candidates for this option because of either advanced
disease at the time of presentation, likely insufficient function
of the remaining portion of the liver, or poor surgical candi￾dacy. Patients with untreated unresectable cholangiocarci￾noma have a median survival of 3.9 months.40 A recent study
reported a median overall survival period of 38.5 months in
patients with unresectable primary intrahepatic cholangio￾carcinoma treated with RFA.41 This is likely highly influenced
by patient selection with tumors small enough in both size
and number to be treated with RFA.
Metastatic Disease
Over the last 2 decades, advances in surgical techniques have
led to effective treatment for selected patients with hepatic
metastases. However, only 10 to 25% of patients with metas￾tases isolated to the liver are eligible for resection because of
extent and location of disease or concurrent medical con￾ditions.1 RFA has proved to be a safe and feasible treatment
option for extending survival in select patients with liver
metastases from many different primaries such as colorectal
cancer (►Fig. 5),42,43 pancreatic cancer,44 cholangiocarci￾noma,45 neuroendocrine tumors,46 breast cancer,47 and gas￾tric cancer.48
Studies on the long-term survival of nonsurgical patients
with hepatic colorectal metastases who underwent RFA
reported a 1-year survival rate of 86 to 99%, a 3-year survival
rate of 46 to 68%, and a 5-year survival rate of 24 to 44%.1
Another study found that the 3-year survival rate in patients
with a solitary colorectal metastases was 55% for patients
treated with surgery and 52% for those who underwent
RFA.49 A more recent study reported that the overall survival
and disease-free survival did not differ between patients
treated with resection or RFA in patients with a solitary

colorectal metastasis < 3 cm; however, in patients with a
solitary metastasis >3 cm, the disease-free survival was
significantly lower in the RFA group as compared with the
resection group.42 A recently published systematic review,
however, concluded that the available evidence was insuffi￾cient to recommend RFA for a radical oncologic treatment of
colorectal liver metastases.50
Conclusion
RFA has been shown to achieve effective and reproducible local
tumor control with minimal morbidity in patients with small
HCC and metastases. It is a desirable treatment option in
patients with early-stage HCC when resection or transplant is
precluded or delayed. It has also been proven a viable treatment
option in patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease. For
large tumor burdens, RFA is limited in effectiveness, and
alternatives such as TACE or systemic therapies are preferred.
