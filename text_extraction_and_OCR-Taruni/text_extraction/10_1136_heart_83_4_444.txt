Abstract
OBJECTIVE To review the anatomical structure of the right
atrioventricular junction, including the specialised atrioventricular
conduction system, in hearts with Ebstein's malformation, to
identify potential substrates for the abnormalities in conduction.
METHODS Five heart specimens representing the morphological
spectrum of Ebstein malformation were examined grossly and
histologically.
RESULTS On the endocardial surface, the atrioventricular junction
was marked by a faint line in two hearts, and by a small ridge in
the other three. Analysis of the right parietal junction in four hearts
revealed only two accessory muscular atrioventricular connections.
A plane of fibrofatty tissue separated atrial from ventricular
myocardium in the right parietal junction in all hearts. The compact
atrioventricular node was closer to the coronary sinus than usual.
Accessory nodoventricular connections were present in four hearts,
while accessory fasciculo-ventricular connections were found in
one. The right bundle branch was hypoplastic or absent in four
hearts.
CONCLUSIONS In this small series, the parietal atrioventricular
junction was better developed than previously thought. Structural
abnormalities of the atrioventricular conduction system, however,
were present. These may account for some of the conduction
abnormalities frequently observed with the Ebstein malformation.
