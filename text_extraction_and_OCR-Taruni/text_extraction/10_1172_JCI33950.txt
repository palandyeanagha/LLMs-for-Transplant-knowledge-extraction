Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by distorted lung architecture and loss of respiratory
function. Enhanced (myo)fibroblast activation, ECM deposition, and alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cell
dysfunction contribute to IPF pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways linking ATII cell dysfunction
with the development of fibrosis are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate, in a mouse model of pulmo￾nary fibrosis, increased proliferation and altered expression of components of the WNT/β-catenin signal￾ing pathway in ATII cells. Further analysis revealed that expression of WNT1-inducible signaling protein–1
(WISP1), which is encoded by a WNT target gene, was increased in ATII cells in both a mouse model of pulmo￾nary fibrosis and patients with IPF. Treatment of mouse primary ATII cells with recombinant WISP1 led to
increased proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while treatment of mouse and human
lung fibroblasts with recombinant WISP1 enhanced deposition of ECM components. In the mouse model of
pulmonary fibrosis, neutralizing mAbs specific for WISP1 reduced the expression of genes characteristic of
fibrosis and reversed the expression of genes associated with EMT. More importantly, these changes in gene
expression were associated with marked attenuation of lung fibrosis, including decreased collagen deposi￾tion and improved lung function and survival. Our study thus identifies WISP1 as a key regulator of ATII cell
hyperplasia and plasticity as well as a potential therapeutic target for attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis.
Introduction
Pulmonary fibrosis can occur secondary to lung injury — pro￾voked by, for example, chemotherapy, toxin inhalation, or col￾lagen vascular disease — or as an idiopathic entity in the form 
of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) (1, 2). Idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; also termed cryptogenic fibrosing 
alveolitis) is the most common form of IIP and exhibits a poor 
prognosis and unresponsiveness to currently available therapies 
(2–5). Respiratory failure, due to distortion of the normal lung 
architecture, develops in patients with IPF as a result of alveolar 
epithelial cell damage that drives enhanced (myo)fibroblast pro￾liferation and activation and, ultimately, increased deposition 
of ECM in the lung interstitium (4, 6). The hallmark lesions of 
IPF are fibroblast foci, which are aggregates of activated myofi￾broblasts promoting excessive ECM deposition. Fibroblast foci 
occur in subepithelial layers, close to areas of alveolar epithelial 
cell injury and repair (7, 8). The presence of fibroblast foci consti￾tutes an important prognostic factor, as their numbers have been 
correlated with survival in IPF (9, 10).
The pathogenetic mechanisms of IPF, however, remain enigmatic. 
IPF resembles a lung remodeling process originating from dysregu￾lated wound repair in response to local inflammation (11) and, at 
the same time, a disorder of inappropriate alveolar regeneration in 
response to repetitive epithelial injuries (3). It is well accepted that 
alveolar epithelial cell injury and subsequent repair, in the presence 
or absence of local inflammation, represent a key pathogenic fea￾ture consistently observed in patients with IPF and animal mod￾els of lung fibrosis, such as the bleomycin-induced mouse model 
(3, 6, 12, 13). Impaired epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk between 
alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells and subepithelial fibroblasts, 
as well as dysregulated precursor cell recruitment, have been shown 
to contribute to the pathobiology of IPF (12, 14, 15). It is currently 
unclear, however, whether increased apoptosis and/or proliferation 
of ATII cells, or a combination thereof, represents the initial trigger 
for enhanced ECM deposition in lung fibrosis.
In IPF, active ECM deposition occurs within fibroblast foci in 
close proximity to hyperplastic ATII cells, but little information 
about the specific phenotype, as well as gene regulatory networks, 
of ATII cells in lung fibrosis is currently available. In the present 
study, we comprehensively characterized gene expression patterns 
of ATII cells freshly isolated from fibrotic mouse lungs, using 
whole genome microarray analysis. We report increased prolif￾eration and altered gene expression profiles of ATII cells in lung 
fibrosis. In particular, we demonstrate that the WNT/β-catenin 
signaling pathway is activated in the epithelium during lung fibro￾sis. WNT1-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP1) RNA and pro￾Conflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.

tein expression were highly upregulated in experimental and idio￾pathic lung fibrosis. Enhanced WISP1 protein expression localized 
to hyperplastic ATII cells in vitro and in vivo. WISP1 treatment 
of primary ATII cells resulted in increased ATII cell proliferation, 
profibrotic marker gene expression, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT). In contrast, WISP1 treatment of primary fibro￾blasts resulted in enhanced ECM deposition but did not affect 
their proliferation. Finally, depletion of WISP1 (using neutralizing 
antibodies) resulted in marked attenuation of bleomycin-induced 
lung fibrosis and improved survival in vivo. Thus, our study identi￾fied WISP1 as a cell type–specific regulator in lung fibrosis in vitro 
and in vivo and highlights WISP1 as a potential therapeutic target 
in pulmonary fibrosis.
Results
Enhanced expression of WISP1 in proliferating ATII cells in experimental 
lung fibrosis. We initially characterized primary ATII cells in lung 
fibrosis by investigating the morphology and proliferative capacity 
of freshly isolated ATII cells from mice subjected to bleomycin￾induced lung fibrosis, as well as from time-matched, saline-treated 
control mice. A similar purity was observed when isolating ATII 
cells from control or bleomycin-treated mouse lungs (95% ± 3% of 
pro-surfactant protein C–positive [SPC-positive] and α-SMA–neg￾ative cells) (Figure 1A). Morphological analysis revealed the expres￾sion of the epithelial marker proteins SPC, tight junction protein 1 
(TJP1), and E-cadherin (ECAD) (Figure 1B; for secondary antibody 
controls, see Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material avail￾able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI33950DS1) as well 
as occludin (OCCL) and pan-cytokeratin (panCK) (Supplemen￾tal Figure 1B) in both cell isolations. ATII cells isolated from the 
lungs of bleomycin-treated mice, however, demonstrated a signifi￾cant increase in cell proliferation, as assessed by Ki67 staining and 
[3H]thymidine incorporation (186%–225% of control ATII cells, 
95% CI) (Figure 1, C and D). In accordance with these observa￾Figure 1

tions, ATII cells from bleomycin-treated mice exhibited increased 
mRNA levels of the proliferation markers Ki67, cyclin G1 (Ccng1), 
and Ccnb2, when compared with time-matched, saline-treated 
mice (Figure 1E). To uncover potential gene regulatory networks 
driving increased ATII cell proliferation, we next performed whole 
genome microarray analysis comparing gene signatures of freshly 
isolated ATII cells from bleomycin-treated mice with those from 
saline-instilled mice. As depicted in Figure 2 and Supplemental 
Figure 2, several gene families were differentially expressed in ATII 
cells obtained from fibrotic lungs, the details of which are outlined 
in the Supplemental Data. In accordance with our initial observa￾tions, ATII cells isolated from fibrotic mouse lungs demonstrated 
a remarkable upregulation of proliferative mediators and/or 
markers, such as oncogenes and cell cycle–associated genes (Sup￾plemental Figure 2). Furthermore, the ATII cell gene expression 
profile also indicated an enrichment of inflammatory stimuli and 
proinflammatory cytokines in experimental lung fibrosis, suggest￾ing that, at least in the mouse, this is part of the alveolar epithelial 
cell response to fibrogenic stimuli.
Differentially expressed transcripts also included genes that have 
previously been reported to be upregulated in bleomycin-induced 
lung fibrosis and IPF, including Spp1 (16, 17), Timp1 (18), Sfrp1
(19), and Pai1 (20). To confirm these findings, we further investi￾gated the gene expression profiles in an independent set of freshly 
isolated and short term–cultured (48 hours) ATII cells by quantita￾tive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 2B), and the findings were essen￾Figure 2

tially the same as in the microarray analysis. Of interest, the expres￾sion of genes of the WNT signaling pathway (Wnt10a, Sfrp1, Tcf4, 
Ccnd1) was upregulated in ATII cells during bleomycin-induced 
lung fibrosis. In particular, expression of Wisp1, a member of the 
recently described CCN family of secreted signaling molecules (21, 
22), was highly upregulated (Figure 2B).
Increased expression of WNT/β-catenin signaling molecules in lung 
epithelial cells during experimental lung fibrosis. The WNT family of 
highly conserved secreted growth factors is essential to organ 
development and known to determine epithelial cell fate (23, 24). 
The canonical WNT signaling pathway, or β-catenin–dependent 
pathway, regulates gene transcription by stabilization of β-catenin. 
Upon WNT stimulation, receptor activation leads to glycogen 
synthase kinase–3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation, thereby prevent￾ing β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK-3β. As a result, β-catenin 
accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates target gene 
expression via interaction with the T cell–specific transcription 
factors (TCFs) (23, 24).
As recently demonstrated, this pathway is expressed and opera￾tive in adult lung epithelium in IPF (25, 26). To further elucidate 
whether WNT/β-catenin activation is an early event in experi￾mental lung fibrosis, as indicated by our initial gene expression 
analysis, we sought to quantify the mRNA expression of canoni￾cal WNT/β-catenin signaling components in ATII cells isolated 
from the lungs of bleomycin- or saline-treated mice. The inves￾tigated WNT ligands were variably expressed in ATII cells, and 
Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt7b, and Wnt10b mRNA levels were markedly 
upregulated, whereas Wnt3a was significantly downregulated 
(Figure 2C). The common WNT receptors frizzled 1–4 (Fzd1–4), 
as well as the intracellular signal transducers Gsk3b, Ctnnb1, and 
Tcf4, were expressed in ATII cells, with a relatively high abundance 
of Ctnnb1. Fzd1 and Gsk3b were significantly upregulated in ATII 
cells of bleomycin-treated mice (Figure 2D). To further confirm 
cell-specific expression of the WNT/β-catenin signaling molecules, 
we identified the cell types capable of WNT secretion and signaling 
by immunohistochemistry of WNT1, CTNNB1, and GSK-3β (Fig￾ure 3). All signal components were largely expressed in bronchial 
and alveolar epithelium, with enhanced staining of alveolar epithe￾lial cells in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs in early and advanced 
stages of lung fibrosis (Figure 3, arrows).
Active WNT/β-catenin signaling in vivo during the development of exper￾imental lung fibrosis. TOPGAL reporter mice were used next to local￾ize the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway in vivo in experi￾mental lung fibrosis. The detailed treatment scheme is outlined in 
Supplemental Figure 3. Mice were treated orotracheally with either 
recombinant WNT3A, to demonstrate the capability of the lung to 
activate WNT/β-catenin signaling (Figure 4A, top row), or bleomy￾cin, to induce lung fibrosis (Figure 4A, bottom row). As depicted, 
bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells routinely stained for β-gal in 
response to WNT3A or bleomycin. Examination of mouse lungs 
harvested at different time points after a single administration 
of bleomycin revealed an activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling 
as early as 5 days after the initial injury, with distinct bronchial 
and alveolar epithelial cells responding to WNT activation (Fig￾ure 4A). The epithelial nature of cells with active WNT signaling 
was further confirmed by colocalization of β-gal and the ATII cell 
marker SPC and the clara cell–specific protein (CCSP), respectively 
(Figure 4B). Increased expression of the WNT target genes Ccnd1
and Wisp1 upon WNT3A stimulation in primary ATII cells in vitro 
further confirmed these results (Figure 4C).
Increased expression of WISP1 in ATII cells in vitro and in vivo in experi￾mental and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Based on the evidence that 
(a) the WNT target WISP1 was one of the most highly regulated 
genes in ATII cells isolated from fibrotic mouse lungs and (b) 
active WNT signaling is present in lung fibrosis, we focused our 
further studies on WISP1 as a potential novel mediator and ame￾nable therapeutic target. WISP1 is a member of the CCN family of 
matricellular proteins, which consist of CYR61/CCN1, connective 
tissue growth factor/CCN2 (CTGF/CCN2), NOV/CCN3, WISP1/
CCN4, WISP2/CCN5, and WISP3/CCN6 (21, 27, 28). Except for 
CCN5, all CCN proteins comprise 4 conserved cysteine-rich mod￾ular domains. They act through binding to specific integrin recep￾tors and heparin sulfate proteoglycans or modulating the activities 
of other growth factors and cytokines, thereby triggering a variety 
of cell functions, such as mitosis, adhesion, and migration of mul￾tiple cell types (27). CCN family members have been associated

with different developmental and disease processes; however, little 
is known about WISP1 and WISP2.
We next analyzed the expression of all CCN family members 
in vivo in mice subjected to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Of 
the 6 CCN family members, Wisp1 mRNA exhibited the highest 
fold increase in lung homogenates during bleomycin-induced 
lung fibrosis (Figure 5A). WISP1 protein localized to ATII cells 
in vivo, as documented by immunohistochemistry, and increased 
expression in lung homogenates was demonstrated by Western 
blot analysis (Figure 5B). In support of this finding, Wisp1 mRNA 
exhibited the highest fold upregulation of all CCN family mem￾bers in isolated ATII cells, but not primary fibroblasts, isolated 
from bleomycin-treated mouse lungs (Figure 5C), underscoring 
that WISP1 originates from ATII cells during lung fibrosis. WISP1 
expression was increased at the protein level in isolated ATII cells, 
as documented by coimmunofluorescence staining of WISP1 and 
ECAD (Figure 5D).
We next investigated whether increased WISP1 expression was 
also evident in human lung tissues derived from IPF patients. To 
this end, we analyzed the mRNA levels of all CCN family members 
in lung specimens obtained from IPF (usual interstitial pneumo￾nia [UIP] pattern) or control (transplant donors) patients. With 
the exception of WISP3, all CCN family members were expressed in 
human lungs (Figure 6A). WISP1 demonstrated the lowest overall 
lung mRNA expression but the greatest difference in expression 
in IPF compared with donor lung homogenates. Furthermore, 
increased expression of WISP1 mRNA was detectable in septae 
obtained by laser-assisted microdissection from IPF compared with 
donor lungs (Figure 6B). qRT-PCR analysis of primary human ATII 
cells and fibroblasts further revealed that WISP1, and to a lesser 
extent CTGF, was highly upregulated in ATII cells but not in pri￾mary fibroblasts obtained from IPF patients (Figure 6C). Con￾sistently, WISP1 localized to hyperplastic, proliferating ATII cells 
in close proximity to epithelial lesions and fibroblast foci in IPF 
(Figure 6D; for antibody control, see Supplemental Figure 4), as 
assessed by staining of WISP1 and phospho–histone H3 in serial 
sections. WISP1 protein expression was increased in tissue samples 
from IPF patients, as determined by Western blot analysis (Figure

each) at the indicated time points and plotted as log-fold increase (ΔΔCt) of mRNA levels in WNT-stimulated versus unstimulated cells. Results 
are presented as mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.02.

6E). Importantly, increased expression of WISP1 was specific for 
IPF, whereas in other lung disorders, such as nonspecific intersti￾tial pneumonia (NSIP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), no regulation of WISP1 mRNA was observed (Figure 6F).
Increased ATII cell proliferation and profibrotic marker release in 
response to WISP1. To begin to delineate the functional contribu￾tion of WISP1, we next assessed the effect of recombinant WISP1 
on ATII cells. WISP1 treatment exerted a strong proliferative effect 
on primary ATII cells (154%–220%, 95% CI), which was more pro￾nounced than that of CTGF or keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) 
(Figure 7, A and B). Similarly, WISP1 treatment led to increased 
proliferation of A549 cells (Supplemental Figure 5A). In con￾trast, ATII cells obtained from bleomycin-treated animals were 
not responsive to WISP1 stimulation (bleomycin, 186%–213% vs. 
bleomycin plus WISP1, 199%–215%) (Figure 7A). Since these cells 
secreted higher amounts of WISP1 (Figure 5), thereby driving a 
proliferative response, we sought to neutralize WISP1 using 2 dif￾ferent approaches: As depicted in Figure 7C, WISP1 antagonism 
using neutralizing antibodies attenuated the increased baseline 
proliferation of fibrotic ATII cells (bleomycin plus α-WISP1, 
103%–148%). Second, these results were confirmed using an 
siRNA against Wisp1 (mRNA and protein knockdown efficiency 
are shown in Supplemental Figure 5, B and C). The knockdown of 
Wisp1 led to decreased proliferation of primary ATII cells isolated 
from bleomycin- and saline-treated mouse lungs, as analyzed by 
cell counting (Figure 7D) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (Sup￾plemental Figure 5D), respectively.
EMT in response to WISP1. EMT is the reversible phenotypic switch￾ing of epithelial to fibroblast-like cells and has recently gained rec￾ognition as a possible mechanism underlying the increase in the 
(myo)fibroblast pool that occurs in pulmonary fibrosis (29, 30). It 
has been demonstrated that TGF-β represents a main inducer and

gene expression was performed using qRT-PCR of lung homogenates harvested 7, 14, or 21 days after administration of bleomycin. Respec￾tive mRNA levels were plotted as log-fold change (ΔΔCt) of mRNA levels in bleomycin- versus time-matched saline-treated mice (n = 4) and are 
presented as mean ± SEM. (B) WISP1 protein expression was assessed using immunohistochemical staining of whole-lung sections of bleomy￾cin- or saline-treated mice 14 days after application (upper panels) and Western blot analysis in total protein lysates (lower panels). Recombinant 
mouse WISP1 protein served as a positive control; β-actin served as a loading control. Data are representative of at least 2 independent experi￾ments using 6 (Saline) or 5 (Bleo) different lung tissues each. (C) The mRNA levels of all CCN family members were determined by qRT-PCR in 
primary ATII cells (black bars, n = 6) or primary mouse fibroblasts (mFb; white bars, n = 4) isolated from the lungs of saline- or bleomycin-treated 
mice 14 days after administration. Results are plotted as log-fold change (ΔΔCt) of mRNA levels in bleomycin-derived versus saline-derived cells 
and are presented as mean ± SEM. (D) WISP1 protein expression was assessed using double immunostaining for ECAD (green) and WISP1

regulator of EMT in multiple organ systems (30, 31), but little is 
known about other cytokines or mediators that are able to induce 
EMT during lung fibrosis. Here, we show that WISP1 treatment of 
primary ATII cells led to decreased mRNA levels of Tjp1, Cdh1, and 
Ocln but elevated mRNA levels of Fsp1 an Acta2, as analyzed by qRT￾PCR, indicating that WISP1 is a potent inducer of EMT in ATII 
cells in vitro (Figure 8A). The induction of EMT was corroborated 
by immunofluorescence staining, which revealed an increase in 
α-SMA–positive cells (Figure 8B, left panel), as well as α-SMA and 
TJP1 double-positive cells (mesenchymal and epithelial markers, 
respectively; Figure 3B, middle panel, and Supplemental Figure 6) in 
response to WISP1. This was abrogated by neutralizing antibodies 
against WISP1 (Figure 8B, right panel, and Supplemental Figure 6). 
Furthermore, treatment with WISP1 led to enhanced migration of 
ATII cells, which is associated with the process of EMT (Figure 8C). 
WISP1 treatment of ATII cells rapidly induced the expression of 
promigratory genes, such as Mmp7 and Mmp9, as well as the pre￾viously identified mediators in pulmonary fibrosis Pai1 and Spp1
(Figure 8D). This strongly suggests that WISP1 not only is causally 
involved in ATII cell hyperplasia but also induces increased expres￾Figure 6

sion and secretion of profibrotic mediators, thereby perpetuating 
the process of lung fibrosis. Finally, the potential of ATII cells to 
undergo EMT in vivo was supported by qRT-PCR analysis of freshly 
isolated ATII cells, which revealed a gain of mesenchymal marker 
expression and a loss in epithelial cell marker expression in ATII 
cells isolated from fibrotic mouse lungs (Figure 8E).
Enhanced myofibroblast activation and ECM deposition in response to 
WISP1. Disturbed epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk is a hallmark 
of lung fibrosis (3, 12). We therefore next assessed the effects of 
WISP1 on lung fibroblasts, the key effector cell type in lung fibro￾sis. WISP1 treatment led to a significant induction of the ECM 
components type I collagen α1 (Col1a1) and fibronectin 1 (Fn1), 
as well as (myo)fibroblast activation markers in NIH 3T3 cells 
(Figure 9A) and human lung fibroblasts (Figure 9D), as assessed 
by qRT-PCR of WISP1- and vehicle-treated fibroblasts. Further, 
WISP1 treatment resulted in a marked increase in collagen pro￾duction by fibroblasts in vitro (Figure 9, B and E). Moreover, 
collagen production was similar in WISP1- and TGF-β1–treated 
cells (219% ± 42% vs. 184% ± 45% for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and 
238% ± 14% vs. 195% ± 11% for human lung fibroblasts, respec￾tively). This was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of 
type I collagen in fibroblasts, which demonstrated increased col￾lagen staining in response to WISP1 (Figure 9C). Interestingly, the 
proliferation of fibroblasts was not affected by WISP1 treatment, 
independent of serum conditions (Supplemental Figure 7).
In sum, these findings suggest that WISP1 also exerts paracrine 
effects on lung fibroblasts, further contributing to its profibrotic 
action and demonstrating its relevance to IPF pathogenesis.
Attenuation of lung fibrosis in vivo by WISP1 inhibition. To assess 
whether modulation of WISP1 activity represents an effective thera￾peutic option in lung fibrosis, we depleted WISP1 during bleomy￾cin-induced lung fibrosis using antibodies shown to be effective in 
neutralizing WISP1 activity (Figure 7C). To this end, we subjected 
mice to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and treated them with 
repetitive orotracheal applications of α-WISP1 or species-matched 
preimmune control antibodies. As depicted in Figure 10, mice sub￾jected to WISP1 neutralization exhibited significantly less pulmo￾nary fibrosis and a marked decrease in ECM deposition, as assessed

by immunohistochemistry for type 1 collagen (Figure 10A), quanti￾fication of total lung collagen (bleomycin plus IgG, 295% ± 17% vs. 
bleomycin plus α-WISP1, 160% ± 31%, compared with saline-treated 
controls) (Figure 10B), as well as α-SMA and tenascin C immunos￾taining (Figure 10C and Supplemental Figure 8, respectively).
These findings were corroborated by the finding that WISP1 
neutralization also led to decreased mRNA expression of the profi￾brotic markers Col1a1, Spp1, Mmp7, and Pai1 (Figure 11B and Sup￾plemental Figure 9A), which is of significance, as we have shown 
that WISP1 induces the expression of these markers in primary 
ATII cells (Figure 8D). In addition, WISP1 neutralization resulted 
in a reversal of EMT marker gene expression in vivo (Figure 11C 
and Supplemental Figure 9B), which were induced by WISP1 in 
vitro (Figure 8A). Interestingly, WISP1 neutralization led to a 
marked decrease in ECM deposition but did affect inflammatory 
cell influx in response to bleomycin (Figure 11A, right panels).
Finally, WISP1 neutralization partially restored normal lung 
function, as assessed by lung compliance measurements (bleomy￾cin plus IgG, 0.065 ± 0.073 ml/kPa vs. bleomycin plus α-WISP1, 
0.09 ± 0.11 ml/kPa, 95% CI; Figure 11D). Most importantly, WISP1 
neutralization significantly improved the survival of bleomycin￾challenged mice (bleomycin plus IgG, 47% vs. bleomycin plus 
α-WISP1, 74%; n = 18 for each) (Figure 11E), suggesting a valuable 
novel approach for the treatment of lung fibrosis.
Discussion
In the current study, we identify WISP1, a member of the CCN fam￾ily of secreted cysteine-rich matricellular proteins, as a mediator of 
disturbed epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in lung fibrosis that 
represents a potential therapeutic target in this disease. We dem￾onstrate that WISP1 was highly expressed in hyperplastic ATII cells, 
mediated enhanced ATII cell proliferation, and induced profibrotic 
marker gene expression in ATII cells. In addition, WISP1 enhanced 
fibrogenesis by inducing EMT of ATII cells and increasing collagen 
production by fibroblasts, indicating that WISP1 exerts its profi￾brotic effects by a multitude of autocrine and paracrine effects in the 
lung (Figure 12). Most importantly, neutralization of WISP1 result￾ed in marked attenuation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.
These findings are of special interest, as the prognosis for indi￾viduals with IPF is poor due to unresponsiveness to currently 
available therapies. IPF is the most common of the IIPs, which all 
exhibit distortion of normal tissue architecture and a loss of lung

function (2, 32). This fibrotic tissue transformation is character￾ized by an increase in total lung collagen levels, with the inability 
of the lung to properly conduct gas exchange. While historically, 
inflammatory processes were thought to trigger and facilitate the 
progression of IPF (32), this view has recently been questioned, 
primarily due to the ineffectiveness of antiinflammatory therapy 
in IPF (3, 33). A major key pathophysiological event in IPF that 
is currently under discussion is repetitive alveolar epithelial cell 
stimulation and injury without appropriate repair and subsequent 
fibroblast activation (3, 6).
At the onset of our studies, we sought to define alterations in 
the phenotype and gene expression profile of ATII cells that may 
initiate and perpetuate the progression of lung fibrosis. The find￾ings that ATII cells from fibrotic lungs exhibited an increased 
proliferative capacity and enhanced gene expression of prolif￾erative mediators indicated to us that ATII cell proliferation is 
a dominant pathophysiologic mechanism after initial injury in 
experimental lung fibrosis. Indeed, injury and apoptosis within 
the alveolar epithelium, with subsequent ATII cell hyperplasia, 
are consistent findings in experimental and human lung fibrosis. 
For example, it has been shown that epithelial apoptosis occurs in 
experimental lung fibrosis (34–36) and human IPF lungs (37–40), 
but a causality between apoptosis and the fibrogenic process has 
not been clearly established (12, 41). Epithelial hyperplasia and 
proliferation are reported in both experimental lung fibrosis (42, 
43) and IPF (44–46). Ultrastructural studies have revealed the exis￾tence of proliferative alveolar epithelial cells immediately adjacent 
to injured epithelial cells (47–49), suggesting that epithelial apop￾tosis and proliferation and hyperplasia occur simultaneously dur￾ing the process of fibrosis.
One of the most important decisions following a microarray 
screen of diseased tissues/cells is the choice of the gene of inter￾est for functional intervention studies. Of all genes differentially 
expressed in fibrotic ATII cells, we focused our study on further 
delineating WISP1 function in lung fibrosis for the following 
reasons: First, WISP1 is reported to be a WNT target, and WNT 
signaling is essential to organ development, a process that is reca￾pitulated in organ failure (24, 50, 51). Second, we and others dem￾onstrated that the WNT/β-catenin pathway is expressed and oper￾ative in adult lung epithelium in IPF (25, 26). Third, we provided

evidence that the WNT/β-catenin pathway is activated in epithe￾lial cells during the development of experimental lung fibrosis. 
Fourth, WISP1 regulation was previously reported in microarray 
lists derived from IPF lung homogenates, indicating that WISP1 is 
consistently upregulated in IPF lung tissues from different cohorts 
(17, 19). Notably, Selman and colleagues also identified WISP1 to 
be regulated in a microarray analysis comparing IPF specimen 
with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (17). Fifth, increased WISP1 
expression has been shown to be causally involved in epithelial cell 
hyperplasia in breast cancer cell lines (52). Finally, recent evidence 
has suggested that WISP1 exhibited antiapoptotic and prolifera￾tive effects on epithelial as well as mesenchymal cell lines (53, 54) 
and its mRNA expression is associated with lung cancer (55).
In our current study, we present in vitro and in vivo evidence 
demonstrating that WISP1 acts as a proliferative mediator of ATII 
cells in vitro and localizes to hyperplastic ATII cells in vivo. These 
data are in agreement with recent reports showing a proliferative 
effect of WISP1 on epithelial cell lines (52, 56). Further, we showed 
that WISP1 acted in an autocrine fashion by increasing the release 
of profibrotic cytokines from the alveolar epithelium, including 
SPP1, MMP7, MMP9, and PAI1. In particular, MMP7 has recently 
been assigned a key role in pulmonary fibrosis and shown to be 
expressed in ATII cells (57, 58). In this study, we demonstrated 
that expression of MMP7, along with SPP1, PAI1, and MMP9, is 
induced by WISP1, essentially suggesting that a plethora of profi￾brotic markers released from ATII cells in fibrosis are under tran￾scriptional control of WISP1. Further studies are needed to reveal 
the distinct signaling pathways involved in WISP1-induced effects. 
In this respect, we observed the activation of the Akt kinase (data 
not shown), which is in line with previous data demonstrating Akt 
activation in response to WISP1 (53).
IPF is considered a disease of disturbed epithelial-mesenchymal 
crosstalk (3, 12), evidenced by the close proximity of hyperplastic 
and injured alveolar epithelial cells to fibroblast foci (8, 47). The 
pathological remodeling of lung tissue during disease patho￾genesis of IPF can be dictated by direct cellular contact or, as 
described herein, the secretion of soluble mediators in an auto￾crine and/or paracrine fashion. WISP1 expression was increased 
in lung fibrosis, but its expression was regulated exclusively in 
alveolar epithelial cells, whereas we did not detect increased 
expression of either mRNA or protein in fibroblasts derived from 
experimental lung fibrosis or IPF lungs. Several findings, how￾Figure 10

ever, also support a paracrine effect of ATII cell–derived WISP1 
on interstitial fibroblasts. We demonstrated that WISP1 led to 
increased expression of (myo)fibroblast activation markers and 
deposition of ECM molecules. While we did not observed an 
influence of WISP1 on fibroblast proliferation, a recent publica￾tion by Colston et al. (54) demonstrated a proproliferative effect 
of WISP1 on cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting a role for WISP1 in 
the remodeling of myocardial infarction.
The hallmark lesions of IPF are fibroblast foci, which are sites 
featuring activated myofibroblasts, synthesizing and depositing 
a collagen-rich ECM. The number of α-SMA–positive, activated 
(myo)fibroblasts is significantly increased in multiple forms of 
pulmonary fibrosis, including IPF, but their origin remains to 
be elucidated. Currently, 3 major theories attempt to explain the 
origin of interstitial fibroblasts. It has been demonstrated that 
resident pulmonary fibroblasts can be activated in response to 
fibrogenic cytokines and growth factors, thereby increasing the 
fibroblast pool via local fibroproliferation (15). In addition, several 
recent studies have shown that bone marrow–derived circulating 
fibrocytes traffic to the lung during experimental lung fibrosis and 
serve as progenitors for interstitial fibroblast (59–61). Third, it was 
recently proposed that ATII cells are capable of undergoing the 
process of EMT, the reversible process by which cells switch from 
an epithelial to a fibroblast-like phenotype, which is initiated by an 
alteration of the transcriptional and proteomic profile of ATII cells 
(30, 31, 62). Here, we report that WISP1 led to EMT by regulation 
of marker gene expression and induction of ATII cell migration. 
As TGF-β represents a main inducer of EMT in multiple organ 
systems (29, 30), further studies are needed to fully appreciate the 
mechanistic role of WISP1 in this context.
In summary, our study demonstrates disturbed epithelial￾mesenchymal crosstalk in IPF and suggests that the autocrine and 
paracrine effects of WISP1, a member of the CCN family of secreted, 
cysteine-rich regulatory proteins, can initiate and perpetuate the 
fibrotic process at the interface of ATII cells and interstitial fibro￾blasts in the lung (Figure 12). Whether WISP1 induces prolifera￾tion, EMT, and/or ECM deposition in vivo is most probably dic￾tated by the ATII cell microenvironment in disease. While an intact 
subepithelial ECM may facilitate proliferation, a disrupted and/or 
perturbed ECM will facilitate EMT, as recently suggested in the 
case of TGF-β (31). WISP1, a signaling molecule downstream of 
the WNT signaling pathway, has thus far not been assigned a role

in pathologies of the lung. Recent evidence, however, suggested 
that the WNT pathway, which is critical during normal devel￾opment and morphogenesis, is reactivated in IPF. Future work 
will undoubtedly shed more light on the molecular mechanisms 
of WISP1 signaling involved in IPF and reveal new therapeutic 
options for this disease.
Methods
Materials. Antibodies against SPC and α-SMA were obtained from Chemi￾con (Millipore); panCK from Dako; TJP1 from Zymed (Invitrogen); α-tubu￾lin and lamin A/C from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; CD45, CD16/32, 
ECAD, and OCCL from BD Biosciences; and Ki67 from Invitrogen. Anti￾bodies against total β-catenin, total GSK-3β, and phospho–histone H3 
were from Cell Signaling Technology; WNT1 and β-gal from Abcam; 
COL1A1 from Biodesign; and CCSP from Upstate (Millipore). Antibodies 
against WISP1 were purchased from R&D Systems (AF 1680, MAB 1680, 
MAB 1627) and Abcam (ab60114). DMEM and FCS were obtained from 
Invitrogen. Recombinant WISP1, PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, WNT3A, and CTGF 
was purchased from R&D Systems. Recombinant KGF was a gift from 
Veronica Grau (University of Giessen).
Animals. Six- to 8-week-old pathogen-free female C57BL/6N mice 
(Charles River Laboratories) were used throughout this study. All experi￾ments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics 
Committee of the University of Giessen School of Medicine and approved 
by the Regierungspräsidium Giessen, Hesse, Germany. Mice had free access 
to water and rodent laboratory chow. Bleomycin sulphate (Almirall) was 
dissolved in sterile saline solution and applied by MicroSprayer MS-IA-1C 
(Penn-Century) as a single dose of 0.08 mg in 200 μl saline solution per ani￾mal (≈5 U/kg BW). Control mice received 200 μl saline. Lung tissues were 
excised and snap-frozen or inflated with 4 % (m/v) paraformaldehyde in 
PBS (PAA Laboratories) at 21 cmH2O pressure for histological analyses.
TOPGAL mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The deri￾vation of TOPGAL mice has been described in detail previously (63). The 
following primers were used for identification of transgenic animals: 
Lac(Z)-F, 5′-GTTGCAGTGCACGGCAGATACACTTGCTGA-3′; Lac(Z)-R, 
5′-GCCACTGGTGTGGGCCATAATTCAATTCGC-3′. Four- to 8-week-old 
mice were used for all experiments.
Alveolar epithelial cell isolation and culture. Primary ATII cells were isolated 
from saline- and bleomycin-treated mice as previously described (64). In 
brief, lungs were lavaged twice with 1 ml sterile PBS and tissues digested 
with dispase and minced. The suspension was sequentially filtered through 
100-, 20-, and 10-μm nylon meshes and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min￾utes. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM, and negative selection for 
lymphocytes/macrophages was performed by incubation on CD16/32- 
and CD45-coated Petri dishes for 30 minutes at 37°C. Negative selection 
for fibroblasts was performed by adherence for 45 minutes on cell culture 
dishes. Cell purity and viability were analyzed in freshly isolated ATII cells 
directly after isolation. Cell purity was routinely assessed by epithelial 
cell morphology and immunofluorescence analysis with panCK and SPC 
(both positive) as well as α-SMA and CD45 (both negative) of cytocentri￾fuge preparations of ATII cells. Cell viability was checked by trypan blue 
exclusion. ATII cells used throughout this study demonstrated 95% ± 3% 
purity and greater than 97% viability. Finally, ATII cells were suspended in 
DMEM plus 10% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 
g/ml streptomycin and cultured for 24 hours to allow attachment. Pheno￾typic characterization was done after this time period. After media change, 
cells were cultured for a maximum of 2 days in a humidified atmosphere 
of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Fibroblast isolation and culture. The NIH 3T3 murine fibroblast cell line and 
human lung fibroblasts (HFL1) (German Collection of Microorganisms 
and Cell Cultures [DSMZ]), as well as primary lung fibroblasts isolated 
from bleomycin- or saline-treated mice were maintained in DMEM contain￾ing 10% FCS and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C as 
described previously (64, 65). Primary cells were used at passages 3 and 4.
Human tissues. Lung tissue biopsy samples were obtained from 10 patients 
with IPF (UIP pattern; mean age, 51 ± 11 years; 4 females, 6 males), 4 patients 
with NSIP pattern (mean age, 55 ± 5 years; 2 females, 2 males), 6 patients 
with COPD (mean age, 54 ± 4 years; 4 females, 2 males), and 10 control sub￾jects (organ donors; mean age, 48 ± 14 years; 5 females, 5 males). Samples 
were snap-frozen or placed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde immediately after 
explantation. Human ATII cells were isolated as previously described (66). 
The purity and viability of ATII cell preparations was assessed as described 
for mouse ATII cells and was consistently greater than 90% and greater 
than 95%, respectively. Freshly isolated human ATII cells were used for 
gene expression analysis. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Figure 12
The role of WISP1 in lung fibrosis. A proposed model depicting the 
role of WISP1 in lung fibrosis is shown. Initial injury leads to increased 
WISP1 expression by hyperplastic ATII cells, which sustains ATII cell 
hyperplasia. Fibrogenesis is then promoted via autocrine (lower right) 
or paracrine (lower left) effects on ATII cell mediator release and EMT 
and/or fibroblast ECM synthesis, respectively.

Informed consent was obtained from each subject for the study protocol.
Laser-assisted microdissection. Microdissection was performed as described 
previously (67). In brief, 10-μm cryosections were mounted on glass slides, 
stained with hemalaun for 45 seconds, immersed in 70% and 96% ethanol, 
and stored in 100% ethanol until use. Alveolar septae were selected and 
microdissected with a sterile 30 G needle under optical control using the 
Laser Microbeam System (PALM; Zeiss). Microdissected tissues were then 
transferred into reaction tubes containing 200 μl RNA lysis buffer and 
samples processed for RNA analysis.
Microarray experiments. Primary ATII cells were isolated from normal 
and fibrotic mouse lungs 14 days after saline and bleomycin instillation, 
respectively, and directly used for whole genome microarray analysis. 
Freshly isolated ATII cells were pooled from 6 different saline- or bleomy￾cin-treated mice. Three independent groups of healthy and fibrotic sam￾ples were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy 
columns (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 
RNA quality assessed by capillary electrophoresis using the Bioanalyzer 
2100 (Agilent Technologies). All samples contained 0.3–1.0 μg RNA, which 
was preamplified and labeled using the Low Input RNA T7 kit (Agilent 
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three sam￾ples each (saline- and bleomycin-treated mice) were labeled with Cy3 and 
Cy5. The labeled RNA was hybridized overnight to 44K 60mer oligonu￾cleotide spotted microarray slides (Human Whole Genome 44K; Agilent 
Technologies). Slides were washed with different stringencies, dried by gen￾tle centrifugation, and scanned using the GenePix 4100A scanner (Axon 
Instruments). Data analysis was performed with GenePix Pro 5.0 software, 
and calculated foreground and background intensities for all spots were 
saved as GenePix results files. Stored data were evaluated using R software 
(http://www.cran.r-project.org/) and the limma package from BioConduc￾tor (http://www.bioconductor.org). Experimental conditions and results 
from all microarray experiments are outlined in detail in Supplemental 
Data, according to the MIAME guidelines.
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using QIAGEN extrac￾tion kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and cDNAs were gener￾ated by reverse transcription using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Quantita￾tive PCR was performed using fluorogenic SYBR Green and the Sequence 
Detection System 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Hydroxymethylbilane syn￾thase (HMBS) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) for 
mouse and human, respectively, and ubiquitously and equally expressed 
genes that lack pseudogenes, were used as reference genes in all qRT-PCR 
reactions. PCR was performed using the primers listed in Supplemental 
Tables 1 and 2, at a final concentration of 200 nM. Relative transcript 
abundance of a gene is expressed in ΔCt values (ΔCt = Ctreference – Cttarget). 
Relative changes in transcript levels compared with controls are expressed 
as ΔΔCt values (ΔΔCt = ΔCttreated – ΔCtcontrol). All ΔΔCt values correspond 
approximately to the binary logarithm of the fold change.
Detection of β-gal in TOPGAL mice. β-gal was detected using the X-gal 
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase) reporter gene staining kit 
from Sigma-Aldrich. Lung tissues were excised and immediately trans￾ferred to fixative containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM 
MgCl2 in 0.1 M NaPO4 (pH 7.3) for 4 hours at 4°C with 1 solution change. 
The samples were transferred to 15% sucrose in PBS for 4 hours and subse￾quently to 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight. Samples were embedded 
in Tissue-Tek O.C.T., and 15-μm sections were cut. The sections were dried 
at room temperature for 2 hours before staining. For staining, the sections 
were washed twice with PBS, and the X-gal staining solution was incubated 
overnight at 37°C. Counterstaining was performed with hemalaun.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. For immunofluorescence 
analysis, cells were plated on chamber slides, fixed with acetone/methanol 
(1:1), and blocked for nonspecific binding sites with 3% (m/vol) BSA. Fixed 
cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 60 minutes 
in PBS containing 0.1% (m/vol) BSA. Indirect immunofluorescence was 
performed by incubation with FITC- or Alexa 555–conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Zymed and Molecular Probes [Invitrogen], respectively). Nuclei 
were visualized by DAPI (Roche Diagnostics). For immunohistochemical 
analysis, lungs were processed using standard procedures, embedded in 
paraffin, and mounted on poly-l-lysine–coated slides. Antigen retrieval was 
performed in 6.5 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, in a pressure cooker, after 
which endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% (v/v) H2O2
for 20 minutes. Proteins of interest were visualized using the Histostain￾Plus Kit (Zymed; Invitrogen).
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested, lysed in extraction buffer 
(20 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% [v/v] Triton 
X-100, supplemented with CompleteProteinase Inhibitor Cocktail [Merck 
Biosciences]). Protein extracts were clarified by centrifugation (6,000 g) at 
4°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Brad￾ford, and 25 μg total protein was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide 
gels. Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes 
(Invitrogen), and the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 
TBS and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. After washing, 
membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary, HRP-linked anti￾bodies (Pierce). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence 
and autoradiography (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare).
Proliferation assays. Primary ATII cells were plated at a density of 15 × 104/
well in 48-well plates, synchronized for 24 hours in serum-free medium, 
and treated for 24 hours as indicated. Primary mouse fibroblasts or human 
lung fibroblasts (HFL1) were seeded at a density of 15 × 103/well and syn￾chronized for 24 hours in serum-free medium. [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml; 
Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) was added to the medium for the 
last 6 hours of each experiment. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS 
and lysed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and incorporation of [3H]thymidine 
was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In addition, proliferation 
was assessed by cell counting 24 hours after stimulation with WISP1, with 
counting performed at least 3 times for each condition.
Migration assay. Cell migration was determined using a Boyden chamber 
assay (ThinCert Tissue Culture Inserts, 24 wells, pore size 3.0 μm; Greiner 
Bio-One) (67). Cells were cultured for 24 hours to allow their attachment to 
the membrane and serum starved, and migration was induced by addition of 
either WISP1 or TGF‑β1 to the medium in the lower wells, as indicated. After 
24 hours, cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet solution (Sigma￾Aldrich), and nonmigrated cells were removed by cotton swabbing.
siRNA transfection. The siRNA duplexes targeting mouse Wisp1 mRNA 
were obtained from Dharmacon Inc. (Thermo Scientific). Two different 
siRNA sequences were tested (si#1 and si#2). The following sequence (si#1) 
was used for all experiments: 5′-UUGAUUGAACUUAUUAGCCTC-3′. 
The siRNAs (150 nM) were transiently transfected into primary ATII 
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) at an siRNA/Lipo￾fectamine ratio of 1:2 (μg/μl). To control for nonspecific gene inhibi￾tion of the siRNAs, a negative control siRNA (scrambled) sequence was 
employed. Cells were harvested and analyzed on mRNA and protein levels 
24 hours after the transfection.
Collagen assay. NIH 3T3 cells or human lung fibroblasts (HFL1) were 
plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well in 6-well plates, synchronized for 24 
hours in serum-free medium, and treated for 24 hours as indicated. Whole￾lung homogenates were used for in vivo analysis. Total collagen content 
was determined using the Sircol Collagen Assay kit (Biocolor) (68). Equal 
amounts of protein lysates were added to 1 ml Sircol dye reagent, followed 
by 30 minutes of mixing. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, 
the supernatant was aspirated, and 1 ml of alkali reagent was added. Sam-

ples and collagen standards were then read at 540 nm in a spectrophotom￾eter (Bio-Rad). Collagen concentrations were calculated using a standard 
curve with acid-soluble type I collagen.
Compliance measurements. Anesthetized and relaxed mice were tracheot￾omized, placed in a small animal whole-body plethysmographic chamber 
(Buxco), and ventilated in volume-driven mode (with a positive end-expira￾tory pressure [PEEP] of 0 mmHg). Before measurement of lung compli￾ance, chambers were calibrated with a rapid injection of 300 μl room air. 
Respiration rate was set to 20/min, and ventilation pressure was recorded 
while inflating the lung at a tidal volume of 200 μl. Ventilator compliances 
are given in kPa/ml and corrected for mouse whole-body weight.
Statistics. All ΔCt values obtained from qRT-PCR and all data derived 
from compliance measurements were analyzed for normal distribution 
using the Shapiro-Wilk test, with a P value greater than 0.05 indicating 
normal distribution. Normality of data was confirmed using quantile￾quantile plots. All ΔΔCt values were analyzed using the 2-tailed, 1-sample 
t test. Intergroup differences of ΔCt values in patients and bleomycin-treat￾ed mice were derived using a 1-tailed, 2-sample t test. Proliferation assay 
data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the signed-rank 
test. Compliance values were analyzed using the 2-tailed, 2-sample t test. 
All P values obtained from multiple tests were adjusted using the proce￾dure described by Hochberg and Benjamini (69). All results are presented 
as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated and were considered statistically 
significant when P was less than 0.05.
