Abstract
Background: Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from a hemizygotic deletion of
approximately 27 genes on chromosome 7, at locus 7q11.23. WS is characterised by an uneven cognitive profile,
with serious deficits in visuospatial tasks in comparison to relatively proficient performance in some other cognitive
domains such as language and face processing. Individuals with partial genetic deletions within the WS critical
region (WSCR) have provided insights into the contribution of specific genes to this complex phenotype. However,
the combinatorial effects of different genes remain elusive.
Methods: We report on visuospatial cognition in two individuals with contrasting partial deletions in the WSCR:
one female (HR), aged 11 years 9 months, with haploinsufficiency for 24 of the WS genes (up to GTF2IRD1), and
one male (JB), aged 14 years 2 months, with the three most telomeric genes within the WSCR deleted, or partially
deleted.
Results: Our in-depth phenotyping of the visuospatial domain from table-top psychometric, and small- and
large-scale experimental tasks reveal a profile in HR in line with typically developing controls, albeit with some
atypical features. These data are contrasted with patient JB’s atypical profile of strengths and weaknesses across the
visuospatial domain, as well as with more substantial visuospatial deficits in individuals with the full WS deletion.
Conclusions: Our findings point to the contribution of specific genes to spatial processing difficulties associated
with WS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of spatial cognition and the divergent effects of genetic deletions
within the WSCR on different components of visuospatial ability. The importance of general transcription factors
at the telomeric end of the WSCR, and their combinatorial effects on the WS visuospatial phenotype are also
discussed.

Background
Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant
disorder arising from the hemizygotic deletion of approxi￾mately 27 genes on chromosome 7, at locus 7q11.23 [1,2].
The deletion occurs spontaneously during meiosis and is
due to unequal crossing over at misaligned repeat seg￾ments [3]. This typically results in a deletion spanning
some 1.55 Mb (approximately 95% of cases) to around
1.84 Mb (approximately 5% of cases) of genomic DNA
[4-8]. However, a number of individuals with partial dele￾tions within the WS critical region (WSCR) of chromo￾some 7 have also been identified [for examples, 9,10]. Such
cases can provide important insights into the contribution
of specific genes to the phenotypic outcome of WS.
Given the uneven cognitive profile characteristic of
WS, particularly the contrast between poor non-verbal
abilities relative to verbal cognition [for example, 11],
research into individuals with partial deletions has sought
to identify candidate genes responsible for deficits in
domains such as global intellectual difficulties [10], social
cognition [12], and spatial cognition [13-15].

In the case of individuals with the full WS deletion,
spatial deficits have been well documented, with poor
performance reported on visuospatial construction tasks,
[16,17], mental imagery [18,19], and the use of spatial
frames of reference [20,21]. More recently, deficits in
large-scale spatial navigation have also been identified in
WS [22,23]. But which genes contribute to these small￾scale and large-scale spatial impairments remains a topic
of debate. One study that examined two families with a
partial WS phenotype, including supravalvular aortic
stenosis (SVAS) and deficits in visuospatial construction,
found that affected family members were hemizygous
for the elastin (ELN) and LIM-Kinase1 (LIMK1) genes
[13], which lie within the WSCR. Given that ELN is not
expressed in the brain and mutations of which are not
associated with spatial deficits but with cardiovascular
abnormalities, it was concluded that it must be the other
deleted gene, LIMK1, that plays an important role in the
phenotypic expression of impaired spatial cognition in
WS. Indeed, in vivo, Limk1 knockout mice have impaired
spatial learning performance when tested on reversal
learning in the Morris water maze [24]. They also present
with abnormal synaptic structure and neuronal spine
morphology, as well as altered hippocampal long-term
potentiation.
The role of LIMK1, however, has remained inconclu￾sive, with other studies of patients with partial deletions
that include LIMK1 suggesting that hemizygosity for this
gene does not in itself result in deficits in visuospatial
cognition [for examples., 9,15]. Using a large battery of
perceptual and visuospatial tasks, Gray and colleagues
[15] report a very detailed assessment of two patients
with deletions of only ELN and LIMK1, compared with
two adults with full WS matched on verbal ability. A
profile of normal spatial performance emerged from the
two partial deletion patients compared to those with the
full deletion, suggesting that LIMK1 alone did not explain
spatial deficits in WS. In addition, the successful perform￾ance of these same two partial deletion patients on a
large-scale spatial task indicated that the hemizygotic dele￾tion of LIMK1 was also insufficient to result in the poor
large-scale search strategies identified in individuals with
full WS on the same task [14].
These findings concur to indicate that the sole deletion
of LIMK1 is not sufficient to result in deficits in any form
of spatial cognition. Instead, the authors suggest that
LIMK1 may play a role in the spatial cognitive profile in
WS only when deleted alongside other genes, particularly
those at the telomeric end of the WSCR. It is these latter
genes that have been the focus of recent studies.
Hirota et al. [25] present a detailed analysis of the
relationships between partial deletions in three patients
and their performance on standardised psychometric tests.
The authors suggest that the general transcription factors
GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, at the telomeric end of the WSCR,
are likely to play a disproportionate and crucial role in the
development of neural pathways involved in visuospatial
cognition. Dai et al. [26] also sought to delineate the role
of these transcription factors in the WS phenotype, find￾ing that an individual with an atypical deletion that
included GTF2IRD1, but not GTF2I, presented with poor
performance on a number of spatial subtests from the
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence￾Revised (WPPSI-R) [27], including ‘Block Design’, ‘Object
Assembly’, and ‘Mazes’. Preservation of the normal copy
number of GTF2I in this individual was argued to contrib￾ute to the relative strengths found in those non-verbal
cognitive measures that did not require visual-motor
integration (‘Picture Completion’ and ‘Geometric Design
Recognition’), and in verbal cognition. It appears, then,
that the general transcription factor genes at the telomeric
end of the WSCR are likely to make a significant contribu￾tion to the WS visuospatial phenotype.
The general transcription factor (GTF) genes are also
thought to have widespread effects on the expression of
other genes [28], and are differentially expressed in the
developing brain compared to the adult brain [1]. The
impact of mutations of these telomeric genes, in particular
on the expression of other genes, may therefore be diverse
and have varying cascading effects throughout develop￾ment. As such, to gain a more thorough understanding of
the role, combinatorial effects, and penetrance of all 28
transcripts within the WSCR (particularly the GTF genes)
on the phenotypic profile of WS, research must examine
the different effects of specific genetic mutations across
partial deletion patients with differing genomic makeup.
It is not only at the level of the genotype that more
in-depth research has been necessary; the phenotypic
outcome also calls for more subtle analyses rather
than solely relying on psychometric spatial tasks. Indeed,
recent research has sought to elucidate whether there are
dissociable deficits within the visuospatial domain in indi￾viduals with the full WS deletion. In particular, the differ￾ent cognitive demands associated with understanding the
location of the self (‘egocentric’ spatial representations)
and object-based spatial relationships (‘allocentric’ spatial
representations) have been examined through the use
of both small-scale table-top tasks [for example, 20]
and large-scale navigation tasks [for examples, 14,23].
The findings of such studies have identified difficulties in
the use of both egocentric and allocentric spatial repre￾sentations in WS. However, little can as yet be concluded
regarding the genetic contributions to the specific deficits
in the use of these different spatial frames of reference.
Given the importance of these aspects of spatial represen￾tation to human navigational abilities, and hence to every￾day living, attempts to examine the genotypic correlations
with these specific spatial deficits must address the use of

these different cognitive processes both in individuals with
the full WS deletion and in individuals with partial dele￾tions within the WSCR. We therefore argue that it is
critical to test, not only performance on psychometric
spatial tasks, but particularly performance on novel, hy￾pothesis-driven small-scale tasks and navigational large￾scale search tasks that tap into egocentric and allocentric
spatial cognitive demands.
Here, we present case studies of spatial cognition in
two individuals (HR and JB) neither of whom meets
both genetic and phenotypic criteria for a typical diagno￾sis of WS, but present with contrasting partial genetic
deletions within the WSCR. Previous comparisons of the
socio-cognitive profiles of these two patients highlighted
the different levels of social impairment that result from
such contrasting deletions [12]. The current study focussed
on visuospatial cognition and examined the impact of these
differing genetic deletions in the WSCR by investigating
performance of HR and JB, using a range of table-top psy￾chometric tasks, and small- and large-scale spatial tasks.
Visuospatial abilities of both individuals were also com￾pared to performance on the same tasks previously repor￾ted both in typical development and in individuals with the
full WS genotype.
Methods
Participants
Data are presented from two individual cases with differ￾ent genetic deletions occurring within or overlapping the
WSCR. The extent of genetic deletion in each individual
was determined using array comparative genome hybrid￾isation (aCGH). HR is a female, aged 11 years 9 months
and has a deletion of approximately 1 Mb which spans
from the centromeric end of the WSCR at NSUN5 to
GTF2IRD1 (72716513 to 73900000). The breakpoint lies
within GTF2IRD1 such that HR is partially deleted for
GTF2IRD1, leading to reduced expression and thus
haploinsufficiency for this general transcription factor
[29]. The remaining three telomeric genes of the WSCR
(GTF2I, NCF1, GTF2IRD2) are present in HR. JB is a
male, aged 14 years 2 months and, in contrast with HR,
has a deletion of approximately 2 Mb with a breakpoint in
the distal WS region within (and so partially deleted for)
GTF2I that extends beyond the WSCR in the telomeric
direction (including a deletion of NCF1 and GTF2IRD2
within the WSCR) to HIP1 (74133268 to 75333536). JB’s
deletion therefore contains 21 reviewed RefSeq genes
based on the most recent build of the human genome
(hg19). Figure 1 shows the genetic deletions of HR
and JB together with the regions typically deleted in
patients with WS.
Both participants underwent a broad range of cognitive￾functioning and visuospatial tasks. Performance by HR
and JB on a mental rotation task, a visual perspective￾taking task, and a large-scale navigation strategies task is
compared to performance by typically developing (TD)
individuals aged five, six, eight and ten years, and a
group of individuals with full WS, previously reported
by Broadbent et al. [21,23] (see Tables 1 and 2 for partici￾pant details). Furthermore, performance by HR and JB on
a large-scale route learning task is compared to perform￾ance from two groups of TD individuals aged six to seven
years and eight to nine years and a group of individuals
with full WS, previously reported by Farran and colleagues
[30] (see Table 3). The TD group age ranges were selected
as marked developmental changes in the spatial abil￾ities measured here occur during this period [31-35].
In addition, the range of verbal and non-verbal abilities in
individuals with WS corresponds with performance on
the same tasks in TD children within these chronological
age ranges [21,23,30]. Ethical approval for the study
was obtained from the Institute of Education ethics
committee.
Psychometric cognitive functioning measures
‘Verbal’, ‘Non-verbal Reasoning’, and ‘Spatial’ intellect
were assessed using the British Ability Scales-II School
Age (BAS-II) [36]. Verbal scores from the BAS-II are
calculated from the Verbal Similarities and Word Defini￾tions core scales, and Non-verbal reasoning is calculated

from the Matrices and Qualitative Reasoning core scales.
Spatial scores are derived from the Recall of Designs and
Pattern Construction core scales. The Raven’s Coloured
Progressive Matrices (RCPM) [37] was included as an
additional measure of non-verbal ability as it has been
established as a sensitive and reliable measure of non￾verbal functioning in WS [38].
Experimental spatial measures
Two small-scale and two large-scale spatial tasks were
chosen in order to measure a diverse range of visuospatial
abilities in HR and JB, which have been previously used to
highlight specific spatial deficits and atypical functioning
in individuals with WS. A behavioural distinction can be
made between the mental transformation of objects and
imagined self-rotations (perspective-taking) [33,39], with
performance on these two types of task associated with
activity in dissociable, although overlapping, neural sys￾tems [for example, 40]. Tasks requiring the use of different
types of mental transformation (namely, object-based men￾tal rotation and visual perspective-taking), measures of
egocentric and allocentric spatial-coding and route learn￾ing in large-scale space were therefore conducted.
i) Mental rotation (MR) task
The ability to imagine the rotation of a 2D object at vary￾ing degrees of displacement from upright was measured
using the monkey MR task, based on the classic mental
rotation paradigm by Shepard and Metzler [41]. Partici￾pants were asked to view images of two monkeys above a
horizontal line and one monkey below the line at varying
degrees of rotation from upright, presented on a 14” laptop
computer screen. Participants had to select which of the
two monkeys on the top matched the rotated one under￾neath, indicating their response by pressing a left or right
button on a keyboard in front of them. The MR task con￾sisted of 28 rotation trials, and four control trials where the
monkey underneath was not rotated (0° position). The test
positions of the target monkey included 45°, 90°, 135° and
180° clockwise rotations and -45°, -90°, -135° anticlockwise
rotations [for full details of task design, see 21].
ii) Visual perspective-taking (VPT) task
The VPT task was used to examine participants’ ability to
imagine the self rotating around a circular array of four
objects, and adapted from VPT tasks used in previous
studies [35,39]. Throughout the task, the participant was
asked to imagine looking at the array from different view￾points as well as a series of questions about the position of
the different objects from the imagined perspectives
(which object would be to your left, right, furthest, near￾est). Given that young children and some individuals with
WS have difficulties distinguishing their left from right
sides [42], each participant was given a sticker on one
hand (randomised left and right across participants) so
that instead of declaring a left or right turn, they stated
whether they would turn to their ‘sticker’ or ‘no-sticker’
side. This was similar to previously reported methods [35]
that significantly improved performance on such tasks.
Using two separate arrays, each participant was tested on
a variety of imagined displacements of the self (45°, 90°,
135° and 180°, collapsed across clockwise and anti-clock￾wise rotations). The test consisted of 28 rotation trials and
four control trials where no imagined rotation was re￾quired [for full details of task design, see 21].
Although validity and reliability of the experimental
measures used in this study have not been established,
on account of their novelty, robust levels of convergent
validity and reliability of the measures on which the
VPT task is based have been reported [39]. In addition,
it has been established that VPT measures are dissoci￾able from mental rotation tasks [39], providing support
for discriminant validity of the small-scale experimental
measures used here.

iii) Large-scale navigation strategies task
When navigating through a virtual environment (VE)
compared to a real one, behavioural performance is
largely equivalent [43], and broadly comparable cognitive
mechanisms underlie learning to orientate [44]. However,
despite showing substantial shared neural activation, there
are some differences in neural activity for virtual versus
real-world environments [43]. This has been attributed to
the finger and hand movements required to navigate
VEs [43].
An interactive VE maze was presented to participants
to examine the spontaneous strategy used by each par￾ticipant during large-scale navigation, and also whether
the participant could develop an understanding of the
spatial relationships between landmarks in the environment
(an allocentric understanding of space), when required. The
VE consisted of a brick wall cross-maze with four paths
radiating from a central square and six distal landmarks
surrounding the perimeter; a modified version of the
‘starmaze’ paradigm used in other navigation studies
[for examples, 45,46]. The VE presented participants
with an environmental layout within which individuals
could use either a sequential egocentric strategy (using the
same sequence of left-right body turns) or an allocentric
strategy to navigate, or a combination of the two (mixed
strategy) for [full details of maze design, see 23].
The participant was first shown the correct route
through the VE from start to finish, by being asked to
follow a green grass path. They then navigated the route
without the aid of the grass path by using the arrow keys
on the keyboard, referred to as learning trials. Learning
trials were repeated until the participant had completed
the route without errors on two trials. Participants were
then asked to continue finding the exit on 12 further
trials, four of which were ‘spontaneous strategy trials’
where the participant was started unknowingly from a
different starting position in the environment.
After the spontaneous strategy trials, participants were
taught a new route in the environment. Following suc￾cessful learning, they were then asked to find the new
exit six times, using the quickest route, when this time
they were knowingly started from different starting
places (a test of allocentric knowledge). An ‘allocentric
score’ was calculated from these six trials, with two
points given for each allocentric strategy used, one point
for a mixed strategy, and zero points for an egocentric
strategy or incorrect trial (maximum twelve points). As
a further measure of their mental representation of the
spatial relations of the environmental layout, at the end
of the task participants were shown a selection of six
birds-eye-view maps and asked to choose the correct
layout of the environment through which they had been
navigating.
iv) Large-scale route learning task
Participants viewed a second VE task presented on a
17-inch laptop screen. The VE consisted of a brick wall
maze with six junctions and sixteen landmarks. Land￾marks were either close to junctions (junction landmarks),
or were mid-way along a path section (path landmarks)
[for full details of maze design, see 30].
The experimenter showed each participant the correct
route through the maze from start to finish. The partici￾pants then navigated the route themselves, using the
arrow keys on the keyboard, referred to as learning tri￾als. Learning trials were repeated until the participant
had completed the route without errors on two consecu￾tive trials. Participants were then tested on their recall of
the landmarks. The number of learning trials required
and the number of cumulative errors made across learning
trials provided a measure of route learning. The number
of landmarks recalled provided a measure of whether
landmarks were used (a key component of route learning
in the typical population).
Statistical analyses
Comparisons of performance on MR, VPT and large￾scale navigation and route learning tasks by HR and JB
with WS and TD data were conducted using Crawford￾Howell modified t-tests for case–control comparisons
[47], developed to compare an individual's (N = 1) score
to that of a small control group or normative sample
(where N < 50). The program ‘Singlims_ES.exe, was used to ’
analyse the data [48], available at: http://homepages.abdn.
ac.uk/j.crawford/pages/dept/psychom.htm [last accessed
3 May 2014]. The modification of the independent samples
t-test takes into account the mean and standard deviation
for the comparison group on the task (and group N), and
the raw score of the single case. A point estimate of

reported for statistically significant findings.
Results
Psychometric cognitive functioning
HR had a Verbal score of 80 (ninth percentile) and Spatial
score of 73 (fourth percentile) on the BAS-II, demonstrat￾ing relatively impaired performance in both of these do￾mains. In contrast, she presented with a relative strength
in Non-Verbal Reasoning, with a score of 98 (45th per￾centile). HR’s age-appropriate score of 32 on the RCPM
also indicated a cognitive strength.
In contrast to HR, JB showed impaired performance on
all measures of the BAS-II, with a Verbal score of 59 (0.3
percentile), a Spatial score of 47 (0.1 percentile), and a
Non-Verbal Reasoning score of 65 (first percentile). Simi￾larly, JB presented with impaired performance on the
RCPM, with a score of 18, an age-equivalent level of 7 years
pointing to a score of only half his chronological age.
Experimental spatial measures
Descriptive statistics for HR, JB, TD and WS groups
from the mental rotation and visual perspective-taking
tasks are shown in Table 1, navigational strategies tasks
are shown in Table 2, and route learning task are shown
in Table 3.
i) Mental rotation (MR) task
On the monkey mental rotation task, HR scored 18 out
of 28 on rotation trials (64.29% correct). This was in line
with the level of performance observed in TD 5 and
6 year-olds (t = -.19, p = .42; and t = -.28, p = .39, respect￾ively), but reliably poorer than performance seen in
TD 8 and 10 year-olds (t = -2.61, p = .01, z-cc = -2.68
(CI = -3.71 to -1.64), and t = -2.26, p = .02, z-cc = -2.33
(CI = -3.29 to -1.36), respectively). HR’s performance
was at a similar level to that of individuals with WS
(t = .64, p = .27), who were at chance level. Conversely,
JB scored 25 out of 28 on rotation condition trials
(89.29% correct), demonstrating a high, near-ceiling
level of performance on this task. Unlike HR, JB
scored significantly above the WS group on this task,
t = 2.03, p = .03, z-cc = 2.08 (CI = 1.29 to 2.87). Al￾though JB’s performance was at a similar level to TD
8 and 10 year-olds, who perform at near-ceiling on
this task, using the statistical methods noted above,
scores were not reliably different from any TD groups
(5 years: t = .81, p = .22; 6 years: t = .84, p = .21; 8 years:
t = .19, p = .42; 10 years: t = -.04, p = .48). That said,
given JB’s high level of performance compared to in￾dividuals with WS, clearly, performance on this task
is a key indicator of genotype-phenotype relations for
the genes under investigation here.
ii) Visual perspective-taking (VPT) task
HR showed no deficits on this task, performing at ceiling
with all 28 self-rotation responses correct, HR’s score for
left-right responses on the task being 100% (14/14). This
reliably exceeds performance by individuals with WS
(t = 4.44, p < .001, z-cc = 4.55, (CI = 3.04 to 6.04)), who
show substantial deficits on self-rotations greater than
45° from their own vantage point. Similarly, JB showed no
deficits on this task, apart from on trials when asked to
state the ‘nearest’ object. This may have reflected a diffi￾culty in understanding the meaning of the word, although
he did get this correct on the control trial. On the trials
requiring a left-right response, JB performed at ceiling
with all 14 self-rotation responses correct. Again, this per￾formance was greater than that observed in individuals
with WS (t = 4.44, p < .001, z-cc = 4.55, (CI = 3.04 to
6.04)), and at a similar level to TD 8 and 10 year-olds
(t = .69, p = .25; and t = .57, p = .29, respectively), many
of whom also performed at ceiling. Of note however,
is that neither HR nor JB performed reliably above
TD 5 and 6 year-olds (p > .05 for all), given that some
individuals in these groups also performed well on
this task. This may be a reflection of the stringent nature
of the modified t-test, given that age-related differences
were found between TD groups on this task [21].
In sum, HR and JB had similar performance on this
task, demonstrating no deficit in VPT. Given ceiling per￾formance, this task may not have been sensitive enough
to reveal differences between HR, JB and older TD chil￾dren. However, performances by both PD patients were
indicative of a visuospatial profile different to that
typically seen in individuals with WS. This high level
of performance by JB was particularly surprising, given his
poor scores on psychometric measures of cognitive func￾tioning, although it is in line with his good mental rotation
performance. The high level of performance in JB on these
two experimental tasks provides a vital clue to the role(s)
of the GTF genes within the WSCR.
iii) Large-scale navigation strategies task
HR learnt the route quickly, in only four trials. Although
this was marginally slower than the ceiling performance
seen in TD 10 year-olds, t = 1.78, p = .05, z-cc = 1.84
(CI = 1.01 to 2.64), this was in line with TD children
aged 8 years and younger and individuals with WS,
who all reached criteria after a short number of trials
(p > .05 for all). On trials examining the spontaneous
navigation strategy, HR did not use a consistent strategy,
but was incorrect on the first trial, then used an egocentric
strategy for one trial and a mixed strategy on the final two
trials. Comparable with spontaneous performance in typ￾ical adults [46], TD children predominantly rely on the
use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate on this
type of task [23,45], a strategy associated with preferential

activation in the dorsal striatum and left hippocampus
[49]. Individuals with WS, however, tend to rely on a
mixed strategy on this task, likely due to the use of visual￾matching and a reliance on landmarks for guidance. In
contrast to individuals with WS, on trials examining the
ability to use an allocentric strategy when prompted, HR
was able to use this effectively, showing an allocentric
strategy and ability to take the shortest route on 5/6 trials.
The calculated allocentric score for HR on this task was at
an age-appropriate level, in line with TD 10 year-olds
(t = .95, p = .18), and at a level significantly higher
than TD 5 year-olds (t = 1.76, p=.04, z-cc = 1.82 (CI = .99
to 2.62)); 6 year-olds (t = 2.96, p = .01 z-cc = 3.06 (CI =
1.82 to 4.28)); and 8 year-olds (t = 1.89, p = .04, z-cc = 1.95
(CI = 1.12 to 2.76)). Similarly, HR scored significantly
higher than individuals with WS (t = 4.79, p < .001, z-cc =
4.94 (CI = 3.17 to 6.69)), who demonstrate particular defi￾cits in the use of spatial relational or allocentric frames of
reference for navigation [23]. HR also chose the correct
map layout, further suggesting an appropriate spatial
relational representation of the environmental layout.
JB took a significantly greater number of trials
than TD 8 and 10 year-olds to learn the route (t = 2.24,
p = .02 z-cc = 2.31 (CI = 1.38 to 3.22), and t = 4.64,
p < .001, z-cc = 4.78 (CI = 3.01 to 6.53), respectively),
reaching criteria only after 6 trials. JB’s performance was
not reliably different to that observed in TD 5 year-olds
(t = .92, p = .19), 6 year-olds (t = .66, p = .26), or WS
(t = .58, p = .29). On trials examining the spontaneous
navigation strategy, JB made errors on two trials, but
used an egocentric strategy on the other two trials,
in line with the strategy predominantly observed in
TD children. On trials examining the ability to use an
allocentric strategy when required, JB made errors on half
(3/6) of the trials. However, on the other trials, JB demon￾strated an ability to use view-matching to search for the
correct path, albeit in an inefficient and laborious manner
that did not include taking the shortest route (2 trials as
mixed strategy, 1 as allocentric). Although this resulted in
an allocentric score that could be considered delayed
when contrasted with TD 10 year-olds, analyses did not
yield any significant differences between JB and any TD
group or the WS group, (p > .05 for all).
JB also correctly chose the environmental layout from
the map selection. This suggests that JB may have devel￾oped a partial mental representation of the environmen￾tal layout. It should be noted, however, that a few WS
participants also chose the correct layout despite show￾ing no other use of an allocentric strategy for navigation.
Although it cannot be concluded that JB developed an
allocentric spatial representation of the environment
to aid navigation, JB’s large-scale spatial performance
appeared stronger than typically observed in WS, and
particularly unexpected given JB’s very low scores on
measures of non-verbal reasoning and psychometric
measures of spatial intellect.
iv) Large-scale route learning task
Similar to her performance on the navigation strategies
task, HR performed at a high level on the large-scale
route learning task, in line with TD 8 to 9 year-olds on
the number of trials taken to learn the route, (t = -.85,
p = .20). She learnt the routes very quickly, in three
learning trials, although performance was only marginally
superior to that of the WS group and TD 6-7 year-olds
(t = -1.41, p = .08, z-cc = -1.44 (CI = -2.08 to -.78) and
t = -1.51, p = .07, z-cc = -1.55 (CI = -2.19 to -.88), respect￾ively). HR also produced only one error on learning trials.
This was, again, in line with the oldest TD group of 8 to
9 year-olds (t = -.84, P = .20), and so could be indicative
of age-appropriate performance, although was only
marginally superior to TD 6 to 7 year-olds (t=-1.49,
p = .08, z-cc = -1.52 (CI = -2.16 to -.86)) and not signifi￾cantly different from the WS group (t=-1.04, p = .16),
given that some individuals in these groups also per￾formed well on this task. HR was able to recall the loca￾tion and identity of landmarks on all eight trials for
junction landmarks, and on seven out of eight trials for
path landmarks. Given that memory for the location and
identity of junction landmarks was also at a high level in
TD and WS groups, HR did not differ significantly from
performance in these groups (TD 6 to 7 years: t = 1.36,
p = .09; TD 8 to 9 years: t = 1.24, p = .12, and WS: t = .79,
p = .22). HR’s memory for the location and identity of path
landmarks however was significantly stronger than the
WS group (t = 1.98, p = .03, z-cc = 2.03 (CI = 1.22 to 2.82)),
and both TD control groups (TD 6 to 7 years: t = 2.08,
P = .03, z-cc = 2.13 (CI = 1.32 to 2.92) and TD 8 to
9 years: t = 1.96, p = .03, z-cc = 2.01 (CI = 1.23 to 2.77)).
HR did not show the advantage for junction over path
landmarks observed in WS and TD. This could be evi￾dence for a somewhat atypical strategy, but it most likely
reflects ceiling performance.
Like his performance on the navigation strategies task,
JB took a large number of trials to learn the route in this
task (ten learning trials) and made fifteen errors, mainly
due to the perseveration of errors at the same junctions
over consecutive learning trials. Compared to individuals
with WS, JB required marginally more trials to learn the
route (t = 1.61, p = .06, z-cc = 1.66 (CI = .95 to 2.35)), but
did not make significantly more errors (t = .91, p = .19),
also due to a large number of perseverative errors in the
WS group [30]. Compared to TD groups, however, JB
required marginally more trials and made signifi￾cantly more errors than 6 to 7 year-olds (t = 1.51, p = .07,
z-cc = 1.55 (CI = .88 to 2.19) and t = 1.79, p = .04, z-cc =
1.84 (CI = 1.09 to 2.55), respectively), and required
significantly more trials and made more errors than 8
Broadbent et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders 2014, 6:18 Page 7 of 13

to 9 year-olds (t = 3.42, p = .001, z-cc = 3.50 (CI = 2.31 to
4.68) and t = 4.07, p < .001, z-cc = 4.17 (CI = 2.78 to 5.55),
respectively).
JB’s memory for the location and identity of the land￾marks was impaired, with a score of two out of eight
and one out of eight for recall of junction and path land￾marks respectively. However, JB’s memory for junc￾tion landmarks was not found to be poorer than in WS
(t = -1.07, p = .15), was only marginally poorer than TD 6
to 7 year-olds (t = -1.61, p = .06, z-cc = -1.65 (CI = -2.32
to -.96)) and not different from TD 8 to 9 year-olds
(t = -1.28, p = .11). For path landmarks, JB scored in
line with the WS group (t = -.92, p = .19) and TD 6 to
7 years (t = -1.43, p = .08) but significantly below TD
8 to 9 years: t = -2.03, p = .03, z-cc = -2.08 (CI = -2.85
to -1.28). JB also did not show an advantage of junc￾tion over path landmarks as observed in WS and TD,
but this might simply reflect his low scores, which
were almost at floor.
Discussion
The uneven cognitive profile in WS has provided insights,
but also controversies, into the genetic contributions to
human visuospatial cognition. Indeed, the elucidation of
which of the 28 WSCR genes play a role in the visuo￾spatial phenotype in WS is complex. Initial studies had
implicated LIMK1 as a major contributor to the visuo￾spatial deficits in WS, on the basis of human partial
deletion patients and mouse models [13,24]. However,
subsequent work on other partial deletion patients
showed that if LIMK1 played a role, it had to be in
combination with other genes at the telomeric end of
the WSCR [9,14,15]. The two genetically contrasting
case studies presented in this paper provide further
insight into the possible combinatorial effects of genes
within the WSCR, including the role of the general
transcription factors on some aspects of visuospatial
cognition. Moreover, whereas previous studies had
compared small-scale, table-top spatial deficits in WS
with large-scale navigational deficits in the mouse,
which place very different cognitive demands on each
species, the current study examined both small- and
large-scale visuospatial abilities in the same participants.
This more in-depth analysis of visuospatial cognition is
critical if we are to understand genotype/phenotype
relations in Williams syndrome.
An interesting pattern of strengths and weaknesses
within the spatio-cognitive domain emerged in both par￾ticipants. In particular, HR showed poor performance on
psychometric measures of spatial intellect (BAS-II) and
mental-rotation, alongside a relative strength in non￾verbal reasoning and VPT. HR’s performance on our bat￾tery of tasks was, despite her deletion of over 24 genes in
the WSCR, therefore not reflective of the cognitive profile
of individuals with the full WS deletion. Indeed, HR
performed at a level significantly above that observed in
individuals with full WS on the VPT task, but below an
age-appropriate level, and in line with individuals with
WS on the MR task.
Neither was the pattern of performance across the
small- and large-scale experimental tasks in HR entirely
typical. Relatively poor performance by HR both on the
psychometric measure of spatial intellect and the mental
rotation task, alongside proficient performance on VPT,
large-scale navigation and route learning, reflects the
multi-faceted nature of spatial cognition. In typical
individuals, moderate correlations are found between
performance on psychometric and small-scale spatial
measures and large-scale spatial abilities [50,51]. How￾ever, in typical development, although performance on
tests of visuospatial memory correlates highly with route
learning ability, this is largely moderated by executive
control [52]. As such, although somewhat overlapping,
small and large-scale spatial abilities are partly dissoci￾able and it can be inferred that visuospatial abilities may
be differentially affected by divergent genetic deletions.
What about the relationship between VPT and naviga￾tion strategies? Moderate correlations are also found in
typical adults between VPT and the ability to use an
allocentric navigation strategy in large-scale space [53].
Accordingly, HR’s high level of performance on the VPT
and navigation tasks (in contrast to individuals with the
full WS deletion, who show substantial deficits on both
of these tasks) suggests that she may be able to use this
ability to spatially update the location of the self and to
navigate successfully following a change in position in a
large-scale familiar environment. That said, little is
known about the extent to which performance on VPT
tasks account for the variance in navigational abilities
across development. Indeed, a high level of performance
in JB on the VPT task contrasted with his poor naviga￾tional ability and low overall cognitive functioning (dis￾cussed later) suggests that they are not wholly associated,
and may be differentially affected by genotypic variation.
In summary, in spite of HR’s deletion of over 24 genes on
the WSCR, including haploinsufficiency for GTF2IRD1,
only some atypical spatio-cognitive functioning was ob￾served that resembles that of individuals with full WS.
These findings suggest that the retention of the more telo￾meric 7q11.23 genes contribute to the relatively good large￾scale visuospatial performance observed in HR, particularly
in the face of her relatively low level of cognitive function￾ing as measured on Verbal and Spatial psychometric scales.
However, it remains inconclusive from this whether each of
these telomeric genes - GTF2I, NCF1 and GTF2IRD2- play
an equal role in large-scale spatial cognition.
If LIMK1 (deleted in HR) plays a role in spatial cogni￾tion, then it may be that the preservation of the most
Broadbent et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders 2014, 6:18 Page 8 of 13

telomeric genes within the WSCR allowed for the devel￾opment of compensatory spatial strategies in HR, reflected
in part by her good performance, albeit with some atypical
features, on the large-scale navigation and route learning
tasks. That said, it is difficult to disentangle between
whether such compensation is due to a genetic mech￾anism, or to the application of an alternative strategy
that transpired through specific training. Further con￾sideration of the modulatory role of both LIMK1 and
GTFs on various visual processes within the WS pheno￾type, particularly in regards to their expression in different
neural tissues [for example, 54], is therefore imperative.
As such, more comprehensive phenotypic studies at
different levels of the nervous system would highlight
more specifically the profile of visuospatial strengths and
weaknesses in relation to the genetic underpinnings.
The profile of HR was presented alongside that of JB,
an individual with a contrasting hemizygous deletion,
which extends telomerically from within GTF2I to be￾yond the WSCR. Two quite differing cognitive profiles
emerged from HR and JB. At the cognitive level, JB pre￾sented with profound impairments across the Verbal,
Non-verbal and Spatial domains, as measured using the
BAS-II. Despite his preservation of the majority of the
genes on the WSCR, this profile of deficits is expected,
given the probable role of the telomeric genes on the
expression of other genes [1] as well as the role of GTF2I
on general intellectual ability [10]. It should be noted
however, that JB’s deletion includes haploinsufficiency
for up to 21 genes, many of which have unknown func￾tion. As such, it remains unclear what contribution they
make to his profile. For example, haploinsufficiency for
HIP1 (deleted in JB) has been reported to be associated
with neurological and neuropsychological deficits inclu￾ding epilepsy and autistic traits in other individuals with
atypical deletions flanking the WSCR [55]. It is therefore
important to take into account that JB has a large num￾ber of genes deleted outside of the WSCR, and is likely
to have altered expression of GTF2I and is haploinsuffi￾cient for HIP1, deletions of which are known to contribute
to lower cognitive functioning. Conclusions regarding
comparisons of the two cases are therefore tentative. That
said, the inclusion of these two cases together provides
insight into the differential effects of deleted genes within
7q11.23 on visuospatial abilities at different spatial scales,
in the face of differing overall levels of intellectual ability.
Surprisingly, JB performed at a very high level on the
small-scale mental rotation and VPT tasks, with scores
significantly above those observed in individuals with full
WS. By contrast, on both of the large-scale navigation
tasks, and like individuals with WS, JB took a long time
to learn the route, with performance below TD 8 and
10 year-olds. Allocentric spatial coding was also some￾what compromised, although not significantly different
from any TD or WS groups (possibly due to the strin￾gent nature of the modified t-test, given that differences
are previously reported across TD and WS groups on
allocentric score [23]). Despite these impairments on
large-scale spatial tasks, his performance reflected an
overall profile unlike that observed in individuals with
the full WS deletion. Indeed, the uneven profile of JB’s
relative strengths and weaknesses across different spatial
scales in the visuospatial domain was also not compar￾able to that observed in TD individuals. Furthermore,
given that JB performed at a high level on mental rota￾tion and VPT tasks, his relatively poorer performance
on large-scale navigation cannot purely be considered a
reflection of low general cognitive ability. Instead, these
findings strongly indicate the role of other genes at
7q11.23 in mental rotation ability other than GTF2I or
GTF2IRD2 (for which JB is haploinsufficient). Similar ro￾bust conclusions cannot be made regarding the role of
WSCR genes on VPT ability, given that both JB and HR
performed at a high level on this task, and the vastly
differing intellectual profiles of the two cases. However,
there may be combinatorial effects of the GTFs and
other more centromeric WSCR genes on VPT, although
this can only be tentatively inferred given the difficulties
in drawing direct comparisons from the two cases
presented here.
Across the tasks in the current study, neither HR nor
JB presented with a clear WS spatio-cognitive profile,
and both performed outside of the typically-observed
variations in performance by individuals with full WS. A
spatial advantage, particularly for mental rotation [56], is
usually attributed to males, which could, at first blush,
be considered to explain the higher level of performance
on this task by JB than HR. However, no gender differ￾ences were apparent in the TD or WS participants
across the battery of spatial tasks employed here, includ￾ing in mental rotation, suggesting that differences in the
two cases presented here are not likely related to gender.
Furthermore, on other tasks HR typically performed at a
higher level than JB, which is more likely a reflection of
their differences in overall intellectual functioning, than
of gender.
These contrasting profiles pose an interesting question
as to the combinatorial effects of genes at locus 7q11.23
on the WS visuospatial phenotype, particularly those at
the telomeric end. As mentioned, HR’s deletion includes
that of LIMK1, a gene that had gained much attention in
the search for mapping from genotype to spatial pheno￾type. Although limk1 plays a critical role in long-term
potentiation in the mouse hippocampus [24], research in
humans with atypical deletions in the WSCR has chal￾lenged the independent contribution of LIMK1 to the
visuospatial deficits seen in WS [for examples, 9,14,15].
More recently, the chromosomal region telomeric to
Broadbent et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders 2014, 6:18 Page 9 of 13
http://www.jneurodevdisorders.com/content/6/1/18

RFC2, including CYLN2, GTF2IRD1, and GTF2I, has
become a focus of interest as a possible contributor to
the spatial cognitive profile in WS [6,57]. CYLN2 (also
known as CLIP2), for example, encodes CLIP-115, which
is expressed in dendrites and cell bodies in a number of
brain regions, and has been found to effect hippocampal
memory processes [57]. HR is not deleted for GTF2I
or other more telomeric genes, but her deletion does
include a reduced expression of (and thus haploinsuf￾ficiency for) GTF2IRD1. Given HR’s difficulties in mentally
rotating objects, these results support previous findings
that haploinsufficiency for GTF2IRD1 in combination with
other 7q11.23 genes such as CYLN2 or LIMK1 may play a
role in some of the (small-scale) visuospatial cognitive
deficits observed in individuals with WS [14,58]. This is
supported by JB who is not deleted for either of these
genes and performed well on the mental rotation task.
Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that the deletion of the
other more telomeric general transcription factors has
impacted the expression of CYLN2 and other 7q11.23
genes in JB [for example, see [58]. It also remains unclear
whether the deletion of other genes beyond the WSCR
plays a role in the expression of intact genes within
the WSCR.
Initially, the examination of visuospatial performance
by HR and JB seems indicative of the additive effect of
deleting each of the GTF2I family genes on the severity
of cognitive impairment, and is in line with other findings
in individuals with extended deletions (approximately
1.8 Mb) that encompass GTF2IRD2, who present with
significantly greater neurological impairments than indi￾viduals with shorter deletions typical of WS [59]. However,
although we cannot dismiss the effects of other deleted
genes in JB that extend beyond the WSCR on cognitive
functioning, JB’s high level of performance on small-scale
mental rotation and VPT rules out the conclusion of a
general deficit, and excludes the role of genes telomeric to
GTF2I in these specific small-scale spatial abilities. Indeed,
the preservation of most other genes within the WSCR in
JB suggest that spatial skills may be differentially affected
when GTF genes are deleted in combination with other
more centromeric genes on the WSCR. Of note here, is
that information regarding whether the deleted region in
any participants with WS in the study also included NCF1
and GTF2IRD2 (an approximate 1.8 Mb deletion that
occurs in around 5% of cases) was not obtained. This is
because, for the majority of individuals with WS, the
genetic contributor to diagnosis is via a Fluorescent in situ
Hybridisation (FISH) test, which does not provide deletion
size information. We assume that the majority of our sam￾ple had a standard 1.55 Mb deletion in line with 95% of
the WS population. Inclusion of individuals with greater
deletions would have resulted in an underestimation of
the ability of the WS group. That said, JB’s deletion did
include these genes and was found to perform at a higher
level than WS on some tasks and in line with WS on
others, findings that would not have transpired had WS
group data been compromised due to the inclusion of
such individuals.
While the current study has highlighted candidate
genotype/phenotype relations in the presentation of two
contrasting case studies, it is clear that future studies
need more in-depth genetics and phenotypics, measured
over developmental time [60]. Indeed, with reference to
genetics, it would be preferable to perform DNA and
RNA sequencing to delineate the precise genomic bound￾aries of the deleted regions, and to examine gene expres￾sion patterns in the WSCR region and throughout the
genome [4]. However, it is also critical that such detailed
genetic studies be accompanied by in-depth phenotypic
studies, particularly at the cognitive level. The phenotypic
analysis requires a broad spectrum of tasks, both psycho￾metric and hypothesis-driven, like in the current study,
[see also, 15] as examining performance only on psycho￾metric tasks [for example., 4] does not yield a detailed
account of phenotypic expression, particularly regarding
the multi-faceted nature of spatial cognition. The fact that
genome function is modified over developmental time as
a function of the epigenome requires a longitudinal assess￾ment from infancy onwards of the details of the changing
phenotype. Furthermore, case studies do not make it
possible to ascertain whether gender influences gene
expression in the WSCR nor whether, in our particular
cases, JB or HR have other genetic mutations elsewhere in
their genome, outside the WSCR, that may affect general
intellectual outcome.
Genetic and phenotypic examination of other family
members would be critical to complete the picture of
such case studies. Thus, numerous factors that include
changes in gene expression across development, but also
environmental influences, education and other individual
differences may contribute to the complex phenotypic
outcomes in HR and JB. For this reason, conclusions
regarding genotype-phenotype associations from individ￾uals with partial deletions must always be considered with
some caution and supplemented by appropriate animal
models. Moreover, such genotype-phenotype correlations
should take into account the possible role of candidate
genes in the development of other neural tissues. For
example, Castelo-Branco and colleagues [54] exam￾ined the contribution of the general transcription
factors to the neural retinal phenotype in WS, finding
patterns of visual impairment that were separate from
the known cortical dorsal-stream phenotype. This
highlights the important nature of in-depth phenotypic
analyses in order to draw more robust conclusions as
to the contributions of specific genes to cognitive
phenotypes.

Conclusions
The examination presented in this paper of two individ￾uals with such contrasting genetic deletions within the
WSCR provides further understanding as to candidate
genotype relations to the WS visuospatial cognitive pheno￾type. The pattern of strengths and weaknesses within the
visuospatial domain that emerged in both participants
speaks, in particular, of the multifaceted nature of spatial
cognition and the divergent effects of genetic deletions
within the WSCR on different components of visuospatial
ability.
A deletion in HR of over 24 genes on the WSCR, in￾cluding haploinsufficiency for GTF2IRD1, did not result
in a phenotypic expression typically observed in WS nor
in typical development. As such, the retention of the
more telomeric genes in HR likely contributes to relatively
good large-scale spatial cognition, albeit with atypical
features. In JB, an individual with a contrasting deletion in
the distal WS region from within GTF2I presented with
good performance on mental rotation and VPT, alongside
poor performance on large-scale spatial and general
cognitive functioning measures. As such, these findings
indicate that even in the face of a stark intellectual deficit
as seen in JB, mental rotation abilities in particular are not
affected by genes extending telomerically from GTF2I.
Indeed, although conclusions cannot be met from such
case studies regarding precise genotype-phenotype map￾ping, the current study provides further insight into the
complex, dynamic, and combinatorial role of different
genes within the WSCR on disparate phenotypic expres￾sion within the visuospatial domain.
