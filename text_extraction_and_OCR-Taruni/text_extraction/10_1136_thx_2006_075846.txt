Abstract
Background: Severe α1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an
autosomal recessive genetic condition associated with an increased
but variable risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


A study was undertaken to assess the impact of chronic bronchitis,
pneumonia, asthma and sex on the development of COPD in
individuals with severe AAT deficiency.
Methods: The AAT Genetic Modifier Study is a multicentre family-
based cohort study designed to study the genetic and
epidemiological determinants of COPD in AAT deficiency. 378
individuals (age range 33–80 years), confirmed to be homozygous
for the SERPINA1 Z mutation, were included in the analyses. The
primary outcomes of interest were a quantitative outcome, forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) percentage predicted, and a
qualitative outcome, severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 <50%
predicted).
Results: In multivariate analysis of the overall cohort, cigarette
smoking, sex, asthma, chronic bronchitis and pneumonia were risk
factors for reduced FEV1 percentage predicted and severe airflow
obstruction (p<0.01). Index cases had lower FEV1 values, higher
smoking histories and more reports of adult asthma, pneumonia and
asthma before age 16 than non-index cases (p<0.01). Men had
lower pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 percentage predicted than
women (p<0.0001); the lowest FEV1 values were observed in men
reporting a history of childhood asthma (26.9%). This trend for
more severe obstruction in men remained when index and non-
index groups were examined separately, with men representing the
majority of non-index individuals with airflow obstruction (71%).
Chronic bronchitis (OR 3.8, CI 1.8 to 12.0) and a physician’s report
of asthma (OR 4.2, CI 1.4 to 13.1) were predictors of severe airflow
obstruction in multivariate analysis of non-index men but not
women.
Conclusion: In individuals with severe AAT deficiency, sex,
asthma, chronic bronchitis and pneumonia are risk factors for
severe COPD, in addition to cigarette smoking. These results suggest
that, in subjects severely deficient in AAT, men, individuals with
symptoms of chronic bronchitis and/or a past diagnosis of asthma
or pneumonia may benefit from closer monitoring and potentially
earlier treatment.
