Abstract
Infections are frequent complications after liver transplan￾tation. The impact of surgical site infections on patient out￾come remains unclear. The aim of our retrospective study 
is to analyze the incidence and predictors of surgical site 
infections after liver transplant at our program and to deter￾mine their impact on patient outcome. Twenty-four (9.5%) 
surgical site infections were recorded among 252 liver 
transplants performed between January 2011 and Decem￾ber 2013. Among perioperative variables, re-transplantation 
was the only significant risk factor on univariate analysis (P 
= 0.015, CI 1.448-29.259), whereas age, gender, ethnicity, 
MELD score, donor type and cold ischemia time were not. 
The length of hospital stay was increased in the surgical site 
infection group (median 12 (5-152)) compared to the rest of 
the patients (median 9 (5-145)) (p = 0.032), while rejection 
rate was lower although not significantly different (0% ver￾sus 4.4%) (p = 0.295). Patient and graft survival at 1, 3 and 
5 years were lower in the SSI group compared to non-SSI 
(p = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively).
Conclusion: In our experience, re-transplants pose higher 
risk for SSI compared to primary transplants. SSI increase 
the length of hospital stay and impact negatively on survival 
after liver transplantation.

Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) is an established 
treatment for patients with acute and chronic liver 
failure. Currently over 6,000 liver transplants are 
performed every year in the US and the outcomes 
have improved dramatically over the last two decades 
compared to the early era due to the refinement of the 
surgical technique, more effective immunosuppression 
and better peri-operative care, including infection 
prophylaxis [1]. As a result, current 1-year survival 
rates approach 90% in many centers. Nevertheless, 
infections remain frequent complications after LT with 
a potential negative impact on outcomes. The most 
common infections after LT involve the surgical wound, 
the abdominal cavity, the biliary tract, the lung and the 
bloodstream [2,3]. In previous studies, SSI after LT have 
been associated with increased mortality, readmission 
rates and costs [4]. Recently, the emergence of multi￾drug resistant bacteria has raised concern [1,5] calling 
for an increased awareness and updated management 
of SSI after LT.
The rate of surgical site infections (SSI) has been 
used recently by regulatory agencies as a measure of 
quality of care and several studies have appeared in 
the surgical [6,7] and transplant [8,9] literature on the 
incidence and impact of SSI. However, the applicability 
to transplant recipients of quality metrics adopted in 
the general surgical population is not well established.

All grafts were procured with standard technique 
from brain-dead donors or from donation after 
circulatory determination of death (DCD). The recipient 
operation included standard vena cava replacement 
technique without the use of veno-venous bypass. 
Recipients Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 
score included in this analysis represents the native 
calculated score without exception points.
The immunosuppression protocol consisted of 
tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. 
In patients with SSI the immunosuppression regimen 
was modified as needed on an individual basis based 
on the risk profile. While the tacrolimus trough levels 
were generally maintained unchanged, mycophenolate 
mofetil dose was reduced or temporarily discontinued 
and steroid dose was tapered.
Peri-operative anti-bacterial prophylaxis consisted 
of ampicillin and cefoxitin for the first 48-hours post￾transplant. Anti-fungal and anti-viral prophylaxis 
included a combination of nystatin swish-and-swallow, 
micafungin, fluconazole, ganciclovir and valganciclovir 
for 3-6 months, depending on the risk profile. The 
post-transplant antimicrobial therapy was modified 
on an individual basis considering clinical factors and 
speciation of microbiology results.
The length of hospital stay was calculated from 
the date of transplant to the date of discharge, thus 
excluding any duration of hospital stay pre-transplant.
SSI were diagnosed according to standard criteria (see 
above) and treated depending on severity. Superficial 
SSI were managed at the bedside with wound care and 
antibiotics, while deep and organ space SSI were treated 
either with percutaneous drainage by interventional 
radiology or with laparotomy and open surgical 
drainage, in addition to antibiotics.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median 
(range), categorical variables were expressed as 
percentage. The cumulative incidence of SSI, graft loss 
and death was estimated by using Kaplan-Meier method 
[12]. Univariate and multivariate analysis using the Cox 
proportional hazard model [13] was used to investigate 
the association between patient, donor and operative 
characteristics and development of SSI post-transplant. 
A similar analysis was undertaken to investigate the 
impact of SSI on patient and graft survival.
Results
The demographic characteristics of 252 adult 
recipients of a LT performed at our program between 
January 2011 and December 2013 included in this study 
are reported in (Table 1).
Among them, 23 (9%) patients developed 24 SSI at a 
median interval of 21 days (range7-88) post-LT. Accord￾ing to the CDC classification of surgical site infections 
and post-transplant is usually more complex than the 
general surgery population due to the effects of end￾stage organ failure, poor general medical and nutritional 
status, frequent pre-transplant hospitalization, use 
of invasive equipment and vascular access, prolonged 
operative time and immunosuppression. As a result, 
LT patients are more likely to develop SSI compared 
to the general surgery population. Therefore, effective 
strategies to prevent SSI are needed in an attempt to 
constantly improve outcomes after LT.
The Center for Disease Control defined SSI as 
infections occurring within 30 days after the operation 
and classified them as superficial (limited to the skin 
and subcutaneous tissue), deep (involving the fascial 
and muscle layers) or organ-space infections (extending 
beyond fascia and muscle layer [10]. In the general 
surgery patient population, risk factors for SSI are the 
presence of coincident infections, pre-operative nares 
colonization with S. aureus, diabetes, cigarette smoking, 
obesity and the extremes of age [11]. Additionally, 
four operative variables were identified by the Study 
of Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) as 
independent predictors of SSI including abdominal 
operation, surgical time greater than 2 hours, 
contaminated or dirty/infected site as well as multiple 
co-morbidities [11]. In LT, the risk factors for SSI and the 
impact on outcomes are poorly defined.
The aim of our study is to review the experience 
at our program with SSI after LT and to analyze their 
incidence, predictors, and outcomes, including impact 
on survival.
Experimental Procedures
We conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult 
patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing primary liver 
transplant, re-transplantor simultaneous liver-kidney 
transplant at our institution between 2011 and 2013. 
Multi-visceral transplants (liver-small bowel, liver￾pancreas) were excluded. The study was approved by 
the Institutional Review Board.
The electronic medical records and the prospectively 
maintained transplant databases were reviewed to an￾alyze the incidence, clinical presentation, microbiology, 
treatment and outcome of patients who experienced 
SSI after LT. Patients with SSI were identified by review￾ing all microbiology records, operative notes, radiology 
reports and discharge summaries. SSI were classified 
according to CDC as superficial, deep and organ space 
[10]. In order to capture patients with prolonged hospi￾tal stay and complex post-operative course, we includ￾ed in our analysis SSI occurring up to 90 days post-LT in 
contrast with the 30 days post-transplant interval of the 
original CDC definition. Other parameters analyzed in 
this study included donor, recipient and operative char￾acteristics of all patients in the cohort.

(see Methods), there were 8 (33%) superficial, 4 (17%) 
deep and 12 (50%) organ space SSI. The clinical presen￾tation, microbiology results and treatment course for 
each SSI are reported in (Table 2).
Microbiology culture results were available for 21 
of 24 infections. Based on culture results, the infection 
was polymicrobial in 13/252 (5%) and monomicrobial in 
8 (3%) patients. The remaining 3 patients were treated 
empirically for a culture-negative symptomatic SSI 
based on clinical presentation.
In addition to antimicrobial therapy, 13 (5%) patients 
required an invasive procedure for the treatment of SSI: 
7 (3%) patients underwent percutaneous drainage by 
interventional radiology and 6 (2%) patients required 
re-operation. No patient died or lost the graft due to SSI 
in this cohort.
Among donor, recipient and operative characteristics, 
re-transplantation was associated with increased risk of 
SSI on univariate (p = 0.015) analysis (HR = 6.51 (1.448-
29.259)), while other variables such as age, gender, 
race, MELD score, DCD status and cold ischemia time 
were not significantly different between patients who 
experienced SSI versus not (Table 3).
The duration of hospital stay was longer in patients 
with SSI (median 12 days (5-152)) compared to non-SSI

Discussion
In this retrospective study we found that the current 
incidence of SSI at our program is 9.5%. In our series, 
24 SSI occurred in 23/252 patients after LT. One patient 
developed two SSI’s caused by different microorganisms: 
a superficial wound infection on day 18 and abdominal 
fluid collection on day 44 growing corynebacterium and 
alpha-hemolytic streptococcus.
Previous studies from other centers reported the 
frequency of SSI after LT between 8 and 37% and the 
variability is likely due to different definitions and 
patient selection [4,14-18].
SSI as classified by the CDC National Nosocomial 
Infection Surveillance system occur within 30 days of 
surgery. However, in our data collection we broadened 
the post-LT interval to 90 days after LT instead of only 
patients (9 days (5-145), p = 0.032). We also concluded 
that SSI is not a significant risk factor for rejection, 
which was of particular interest to us considering that 
patients with clinical suspicion for infection have their 
immunosuppression reduced (Table 4).
There were 10/252 (4%) episodes of biopsy-proven 
acute cellular rejection in the present cohort during the 
study period of 90-days post-transplant, none of which 
occurred in patients with SSI.
After a median follow-up of 47 months, patient 
survival at 1, 3, 5 years was 84%, 80% and 79%. Survival 
in the SSI group was significantly different from survival 
in the non-SSI group at 1, 3 and 5 years. (p = 0.006). 
Similarly, graft survival was inferior in SSI patients (58% 
58%, 58% at 1, 3, 5 years) compared to non-SSI (85%, 
80%, 80%, p = 0.003) (Figure 1).

Impact of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) on rejection rate and length of stay: We can conclude that SSI is not a significant risk factor 
for rejection, however SSI does significantly prolong hospital stay.

significantly longer compared to the threshold of 2 hours 
previously reported in general surgery patients [11].
Other transplant-specific risk factors for intra￾abdominal infection post-LT have been identified 
including the type of biliary anastomosis (duct-to￾duct versus roux-en-y hepatico-jejunostomy, due to 
the putative protective effect of preserving the native 
Sphincter of Oddi) and the occurrence of hepatic 
artery thrombosis post-LT [9,21]. Several other risk 
factors for SSI in LT recipients that have been reported 
include surgical complexity, poor nutritional status, co￾morbidities, frequent prolonged pre-transplant hospital 
stay, invasive procedures and use of intra-vascular 
catheters. Some of these factors are in common with 
patients undergoing non-transplant liver surgery whose 
reported incidence of SSI varies between 7 and 27%, 
attributed to hypoalbuminemia, dialysis, operative time 
and extent of liver resection [22]. In turn, these factors 
lead to increased risk of colonization with multi-drug￾resistant organisms [23].
Other significant findings of our study are the 
increased length of stay and negative impact of SSI 
on survival. Prior studies reported that SSI after LT 
are associated with significant increase in resource 
utilization. In a multicenter study that examined 916 LT 
cases between 1990-1995, patients who developed SSI 
(292/916) incurred an extra $160,000 in extra charges 
had 24 extra hospital stays on average. Further, SSI was 
the single most impactful factor on resource utilization 
when considering the cost of LT [16].
In our series the median length of stay was 4 days 
longer in the SSI group compared to non SSI. This has a 
direct impact on costs. A prior group reported that SSI 
patients were five times more likely to get readmitted 
to the hospital and twice as likely to die [15].
the first 30 days in order to capture late infections 
occurring in patients with prolonged post-LT course. 
Unlike in most elective general surgery operations, 
the recovery period after LT can be prolonged and 
complicated, occasionally extending for several 
weeks, especially in high MELD patients due to the 
advanced disease state of transplant candidates and 
the associate multi-organ system involvement, such 
as acute kidney injury and others. As a result, in such 
debilitated patients, SSI may occur beyond the first 30 
post-operative days and would not be captured by the 
current definition. We believe that the expansion of the 
post-LT period of surveillance for SSI to 90 days more 
accurately reflect the severity of their disease and more 
reliably captures relevant infections that would have 
otherwise not been included. Other studies adopted 
this wider post-LT interval up to 90 days [19] including 
the very first study on this subject where the study 
interval was extended up to one-year post-LT [16]. The 
current low rate of SSI in our experience results from 
a combination of effective peri-operative infection 
prophylaxis, close patient monitoring and individualized 
immunosuppression management. However, their 
frequency remains higher compared with the incidence 
of SSI in the general surgery population reported 
between 2-4% [10] highlighting, among other factors, 
the impact of the immunosuppression state on the 
increased risk of infection.
In addition to immunosuppression, several operative 
characteristics, including the length of operative time, 
impact on the risk of SSI after LT. Previous studies 
emphasized that the risk of surgical site infection 
can be stratified based on operative time [20]. Our 
length of operative time for LT is usually between 4-6 
hours depending on the complexity of the case (data 
not reported) and this duration of the operation is

In addition to increasing costs, SSI also impact patient 
outcomes. In our experience SSI has a significant impact 
on patient and graft survival. This is in line with prior 
studies that showed that transplant patients with SSI 
are more likely to lose their graft, with a relative risk 
of graft loss or death within one year of transplant of 
2.95. In the same study, the risk of graft loss or death 
was even greater when considering only deep or organ￾space infections [4]. There is no general consensus on 
the most effective prevention strategy for SSI since 
many observations from prior studies are center￾specific. According to the Cochrane Database Review 
from Almeida, et al. in 2015, no particular antibiotic 
prophylactic regimen has been identified so far to 
prevail over other regimens.
The strength in our study comes from a uniform 
protocol of single-center experience, a unified team 
of transplant surgeons and staff, infectious disease 
and transplant hepatology consultants. The detailed 
chart review was performed by a single investigator, 
ensuring all charts were reviewed in the same detailed 
and systematic fashion. The single-center experience is 
also a limitation of the study, in that it limits the overall 
number of patients that can be analyzed. Our results 
are therefore difficult to generalize to other programs. 
The limited sample size prevented a more meaningful 
multivariate analysis which would have allowed us to 
identify potential causal relationships between certain 
characteristics and SSI. The retrospective nature of this 
chart review may have also failed to identify certain 
empirically treated infections that lacked proper 
documentation. Finally, we did not evaluate the impact 
of induction immunosuppression on SSI.
In conclusion, patients undergoing re-transplantation 
are at a significantly increased risk for infections. 
SSI prolong the hospital stay and impact negatively 
on survival. Future studies are needed to identify 
independent predictors of surgical site infection and to 
design effective preventive strategies.
