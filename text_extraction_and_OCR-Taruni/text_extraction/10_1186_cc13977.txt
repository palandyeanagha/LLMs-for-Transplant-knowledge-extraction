Abstract
Introduction: Recently, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) proposed a new definition and
classification of acute kidney injury (AKI) on the basis of the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and
End-stage renal failure) and AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) criteria, but comparisons of the three criteria in
critically ill patients are rare.
Methods: We prospectively analyzed a clinical database of 3,107 adult patients who were consecutively admitted
to one of 30 intensive care units of 28 tertiary hospitals in Beijing from 1 March to 31 August 2012. AKI was defined
by the RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria. Receiver operating curves were used to compare the predictive ability for
mortality, and logistic regression analysis was used for the calculation of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
Results: The rates of incidence of AKI using the RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria were 46.9%, 38.4%, and 51%,
respectively. KDIGO identified more patients than did RIFLE (51% versus 46.9%, P = 0.001) and AKIN (51% versus
38.4%, P <0.001). Compared with patients without AKI, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for those
diagnosed as AKI by using the RIFLE (27.8% versus 7%, P <0.001), AKIN (32.2% versus 7.1%, P <0.001), and KDIGO
(27.4% versus 5.6%, P <0.001) criteria, respectively. There was no difference in AKI-related mortality between RIFLE
and KDIGO (27.8% versus 27.4%, P = 0.815), but there was significant difference between AKIN and KDIGO (32.2%
versus 27.4%, P = 0.006). The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve for in-hospital mortality were
0.738 (P <0.001) for RIFLE, 0.746 (P <0.001) for AKIN, and 0.757 (P <0.001) for KDIGO. KDIGO was more predictive
than RIFLE for in-hospital mortality (P <0.001), but there was no difference between KDIGO and AKIN (P = 0.12).
Conclusions: A higher incidence of AKI was diagnosed according to KDIGO criteria. Patients diagnosed as AKI had
a significantly higher in-hospital mortality than non-AKI patients, no matter which criteria were used. Compared
with the RIFLE criteria, KDIGO was more predictive for in-hospital mortality, but there was no significant difference
between AKIN and KDIGO.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common, especially in
the intensive care unit (ICU). It is also associated with
increased mortality and a longer stay in the hospital
[1-7]. There have been many definitions, such as acute
renal failure and renal impairment, and this has made it
difficult to compare results across studies. In 2004, the
Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group proposed a classi￾fication for AKI: the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of Kidney
Function, and End-stage Kidney Disease (RIFLE) classifica￾tion, the first evidence-based consensus [8]. The classifica￾tion includes three grades of severity of AKI (risk, injury,
and failure) according to relative changes in serum creatin￾ine (SCr) and urine output and two outcomes (loss of kid￾ney function and end-stage kidney disease, or ESKD). It
has been evaluated in many studies of critically ill patients
with AKI and has shown good relevance for diagnosing
and classifying the severity of AKI as well as comparable
predictive ability for mortality [7,9-13].
In 2007, the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) group
proposed a modified version of the RIFLE classification,
which aimed to improve the sensitivity of AKI criteria [14].
There were several changes: an absolute increase in SCr of

at least 26.4 μmol/L was added to stage 1; patients start￾ing RRT were classified as stage 3, irrespectively of SCr;
and the change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the
two outcome classes were removed. AKI diagnosis was
based on change between two creatinine values within a
48-hour period for AKIN classification and within a 1-
week window for RIFLE criteria. Severity of AKI in AKIN
is staged over the course of 7 days by fold-change in
creatinine from baseline.
The latest classification was proposed by the Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute
Kidney Injury Work Group, was based on the previous
two classifications, and had the aim of unifying the defin￾ition of AKI [15]. According to this definition, AKI was di￾agnosed as an increase in SCr by at least 26.4 μmol/L
within 48 hours or an increase in SCr to 1.5 times base￾line, which is known or presumed to have occurred within
7 days before, or a urine volume of less than 0.5 mL/kg per
hour for 6 hours. For KDIGO criteria, the 26.4 μmol/L
increase needs to be within 48 hours but a 1.5-fold increase
can occur within 7 days to diagnose AKI; and the 1-week
or 48-hour timeframe is for diagnosis of AKI, not for
staging. A patient can be staged over the entire episode
of AKI. Increase in SCr to 3 times baseline, or SCr of
more than 4.0 mg/dL (354 μmol/L), or starting RRT were
all classified as stage 3. KDIGO removes the 0.5 mg/dL
increase for creatinine more than 4 mg/dL to diagnose
stage 3. Besides, KDIGO explicitly states that a rolling
baseline can be used over 48-hour and 7-day periods for
diagnosis of AKI, but it is unclear how this is handled in
RIFLE or AKIN. The definition and difference among the
three criteria are shown in Additional file 1.
Many studies have compared RIFLE with AKIN in crit￾ically ill patients, but only a few have compared KDIGO
with these criteria in critically ill patients with AKI. The
purposes of this study were to determine the incidence
of AKI in critically ill patients according to the RIFLE,
AKIN, and KDIGO criteria and to compare their predict￾ive ability.
Materials and methods
Study cohort
This study used a database from a prospective, multicen￾ter, observational study which investigated the epidemi￾ology of AKI in critically ill patients at 30 ICUs of 28
tertiary hospitals in Beijing, China, from 1 March to 31
August 2012. (For a complete list of those hospitals and
the persons responsible for the acquisition of data, see
Additional file 2.) All patients who were older than 18 years
and who were consecutively admitted to any participating
ICU during the observational period were enrolled. For
patients with multiple admissions, only the first admis￾sion was considered. Patients who had ESKD, underwent
any renal replacement therapy (RRT), received kidney
transplantation during the past 3 months, or stayed in the
ICU for less than 24 hours were excluded.
Data collection
Demographic data, dates of admission to the hospital
and the ICU, primary diagnosis, co-morbidities, under￾lying chronic kidney disease, urine output (hourly or
total urine volume in a 6-hour period), SCr, the need for
mechanical ventilation, and the use of vasoactive drugs
were continuously recorded for 10 days or until dis￾charge from the ICU, whichever occurred earlier. Dates
of discharge from the ICU and the hospital were also
documented. In-hospital mortality was recorded as the
primary outcome. Non-renal Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) scores [16], Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and re￾lated clinical data were also recorded.
Definition of acute kidney injury
The occurrence of AKI after ICU admission was deter￾mined by using the RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria.
Patients were categorized on the basis of SCr or urine
output or both; the criteria that led to the worst classifi￾cation were used. We did not use the GFR criteria. We
used the lowest known SCr value during the past 3 months
as the baseline creatinine in RIFLE and KDIGO criteria.
For patients without known baseline, we used an esti￾mated baseline or the lowest creatinine value during their
stay in the ICU, whichever was lower. The baseline cre￾atinine was estimated by using the simplified modification
of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula, assuming a GFR
of 75 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, and customized for the Chinese
population, assuming a GFR of 75 mL/min per 1.73 m2
[17]. In this study, the baseline creatinine of 754 patients
was not known; the MDRD formula was applied for 120
patients to estimate baseline creatinine; for 634 patients, the
lowest creatinine values during stay in the ICU were used as
baseline. For AKIN criteria, the ICU admission creatinine
was used as the baseline, and a rolling baseline was
also used over the course of 48 hours. Severity of AKI based
on AKIN is staged over the course of 7 days by change
in creatinine. For KDIGO criteria, the 1-week or 48-hour
timeframe was for diagnosis of AKI, not staging; and a pa￾tient can be staged over the entire episode of AKI. Patients
were evaluated daily by using the RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO
criteria after admission, until day 10 or discharge from the
ICU, and the maximum RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO within
ICU hospitalization were recorded. The worst classification
during the patient’s ICU stay was used.
Ethics
The study was approved by the institutional review boards
of Fuxing Hospital, Capital Medical University, and all other
participating hospitals (Additional file 3). The institutional
Luo et al. Critical Care 2014, 18:R144 Page 2 of 8

review board specifically approved the informed consent
waiver because of the anonymous and purely observa￾tional nature of this study.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using SPSS 17.0.1 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Non-normally distributed continuous
variables were presented as median with inter￾quartile range (IQR) and compared by Mann–Whitney
U test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis-of-variance test with
Bonferroni correction. The categorical data were reported
as proportions and compared by using the Fisher exact
test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the as￾sociation of each RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO category with
in-hospital mortality. ICU patients without AKI were used
as the reference group. The discriminative ability of the
criteria to correctly predict mortality was assessed by
calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A comparison of the
ROC curves was performed by using a method described
by DeLong and colleagues [18]. A P value of less than 0.05
was considered to be significant.
Results
During the study period, 9,049 patients were consecu￾tively admitted to one of 30 ICUs. In total, 5,942 patients
were excluded; of these patients, 110 were younger than
18 years old, one received renal transplantation during the
past 3 months, and 95 patients had received RRT before
admission to the ICU. A further 5,725 patients were ex￾cluded because their length of stay in the ICU was less than
24 hours, and 11 were excluded because of insufficient clin￾ical recordings. Finally, 3,107 patients were enrolled. The
characteristics of the whole cohort are shown in Table 1.
Comparison of incidence of acute kidney injury
AKI was diagnosed in 1,458 (46.9%) patients by using
the RIFLE classification: 20.8% with Risk, 12.4% with
Injury, and 13.8% with Failure. According to AKIN cri￾teria, AKI occurred in 1,193 (38.4%) patients: 19% with
stage 1, 6.6% with stage 2, and 12.8% with stage 3. When
KDIGO criteria were used, AKI occurred in 1,584 (51%)
patients: 23.1% with stage 1, 11.8% with stage 2, and
16% with stage 3. The KDIGO criteria were more sensi￾tive than RIFLE (51% versus 46.9%, P <0.01) and AKIN
(51% versus 38.4%, P <0.001).
A total of 259 patients received RRT within 10 days
after ICU admission. According to the KDIGO and
AKIN criteria, 247 of them were identified as AKI with
stage 3; the other 12 patients without AKI received RRT
for a number of reasons, including sepsis and drug over￾dose. On the basis of the RIFLE criteria, 245 patients
were diagnosed with AKI: 14 with Risk, 33 with Injury,
and 198 with Failure.

The KDIGO criteria identified 126 more patients with
AKI than the RIFLE criteria did: 106 with stage 1, 12 with
stage 2, and 8 with stage 3 (Table 2). Among them, 124
patients were identified by an increase in creatinine alone,
and the other two patients received RRT. Seventy patients
were defined by KDIGO as stage 3 but not as failure by
RIFLE (19 with Risk, 44 with Injury, and 8 without AKI),
and 49 of them received RRT.
Compared with the AKIN criteria, KDIGO diagnosed
391 more patients as having AKI; 270 of them were cate￾gorized as stage 1, 84 as stage 2, and 37 as stage 3 (Table 3).
Among 391 patients, only 25 patients had chronic kidney
disease. However, the median creatinine of these 391 pa￾tients on the first day of ICU admission was 118.6 μmol/L
(IQR 78 to 159.7), which was much higher than the
baseline: 118.6 (IQR 78 to 159.7) versus 70 (IQR 49 to
86), P <0.001.
Comparison of outcomes
In-hospital mortality
Crude in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for
AKI patients than for non-AKI patients, regardless of the
definition used: the RIFLE (27.8% versus 7%, P < 0.0001),
AKIN (32.2% versus 7.1%, P < 0.0001) and KDIGO (27.4%
versus 5.6%, P < 0.0001) criteria. Mortality rate of patients
identified as AKI by AKIN was higher than by KDIGO or
RIFLE (32.2% versus 27.4%, P = 0.006, and 32.2% versus
27.8%, P = 0.013; respectively) but did not differ signifi￾cantly between RIFLE and KDIGO (27.8% versus 27.4%,
P = 0.82) (Table 4).
We also compared the in-hospital mortality of patients
without AKI according different criteria and found that
the patients identified by KDIGO but missed by AKIN
or RIFLE had higher mortality than patients with no￾AKI based on KDIGO (12.8% versus 5.6%, P < 0.01; 23%
versus 5.6%, P < 0.001).
The mortality rates of patients missed by the RIFLE
criteria but identified by KDIGO as stage 1, stage 2, and
stage 3 were 20.8%, 33.3%, and 37.5%, respectively. The
mortality rates of those missed by the AKIN criteria but
identified by KDIGO as stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3
were 9.6%, 19%, and 21.6%, respectively.
Length of intensive care unit stays (alive)
In our study, length of ICU stay was longer in patients with
AKI than in those without AKI, no matter which criteria
were used: the RIFLE (5 [3-10] versus 3 [2-6], P < 0.001),
AKIN (5 [3-11] versus 3 [2-6], P < 0.001), and KDIGO
(5 [3-10] versus 3 [2-6], P < 0.001) criteria. For patients
missed by RIFLE or AKIN but identified by KDIGO,
length of ICU stay was also longer than that of pa￾tients with no-AKI based on KDIGO (5 [3-8] versus 3
[2-6], P < 0.01; [3-10] versus 3 [2-6], P < 0.01; respectively).
Predictive ability for mortality
Irrespectively of which definition was used, AKI was in￾dependently associated with in-hospital mortality even
after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension,
chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, and SOFA
score (without renal component) (Table 5).
For patients diagnosed as AKI by KDIGO but not by RI￾FLE, AKI was also an independent risk factor of in-hospital
mortality (odds ratio (OR) 4.498, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 3.727 to 5.429, P < 0.001) even after adjustment for
age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease,
chronic heart failure, and SOFA score (without renal com￾ponent). Similarly, for patients identified as AKI by KDGIO
but not by AKIN, AKI was an independent risk factor for
mortality (OR 1.963, 95% CI 1.139 to 2.898, P < 0.01).
The area-under-ROC curves for in-hospital mortality for
RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria were 0.738 (P < 0.001),
0.746 (P < 0.001), and 0.757 (P < 0.001), respectively. Com￾pared with the RIFLE criteria, KDIGO had greater predict￾ive ability for in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001) (Figure 1
and Table 6). But there was no significant difference be￾tween AKIN and KDIGO (P = 0.38).
Patients with known baseline
For patients with known baseline (n = 2,353), the rates of
incidence of AKI according to RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO
were 45.5%, 39%, and 50.6%, respectively. The KDIGO
criteria were more sensitive than RIFLE (50.6% versus
45.5%, P < 0.01) and AKIN (50.6% versus 39%, P < 0.001).
Compared with patients without AKI, in-hospital mortal￾ity was significantly higher for those diagnosed as AKI by

the RIFLE (27.8% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001), AKIN (31.7% ver￾sus 7%, P < 0.001), and KDIGO (27.4% versus 5.7%, P <

mortality between RIFLE and KDIGO (P = 0.82), but there
was significant difference between AKIN and KDIGO
(31.7% versus 27.4%, P =0.031). These results were identi￾cal to that of the whole study cohort.
Discussion
Numerous studies have compared the RIFLE and AKIN
criteria for AKI. However, the incidence of AKI still var￾ied. Based on these two criteria, the KDIGO criteria
were recently proposed in order to unify the definition
of AKI. To date, only a few previous studies have com￾pared the incidence and mortality of AKI in critically ill
patients according to these three definitions [19-21].
This is the first, large, multicenter study to compare
these three different criteria in critically ill patients with
AKI in China.
The incidence of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria
was higher than that defined by RIFLE and AKIN, even
after we excluded patients without known baseline cre￾atinine. It was similar to the results of a study comparing
definitions of AKI in hospitalized individuals in Boston
[20] but differed from a retrospective study of patients
after cardiac surgery, which concluded that incidence
and outcome of AKI according to the RIFLE, AKIN, and
KDIGO classification were similar [19]. The study of
hospitalized patients conducted by Fujii and colleagues
in Japan concluded that the rates of incidence of AKI
according to RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO were 11%, 4.8%,
and 11.6%, respectively [21]. KDIGO classified 126
(4.1%) more patients with AKI than RIFLE did, the ma￾jority of which were patients with stage 1. An in-depth
analysis of these patients found that the majority (124
patients) were identified by a small increase in creatinine
alone but that the remaining two patients received RRT
at the same time. Firstly, we found that for some pa￾tients there was a decrease in creatinine after admission
to the ICU, followed by a relative increase; these patients
could be identified by KDIGO and AKIN because a roll￾ing in-hospital baseline was used for the 48-hour rise,
but not by RIFLE. Secondly, patients who received RRT
would be classified as stage 3 by KDIGO and AKIN, irre￾spectively of SCr, but not by RIFLE.
When compared with AKIN, KDIGO diagnosed AKI
in an additional 391 patients, including 25 patients with
chronic kidney disease; these patients were predomin￾antly stage 1, followed by stage 2 and stage 3. The median

creatinine level in these 391 patients on their first day of
admission to the ICU was much higher than the baseline
level, and this means that AKI may have been present on
the day of ICU admission or even before. According to
the AKIN criteria, AKI was diagnosed by two creatinine
measurements within 48 hours. However, most patients
did not have creatinine measured every day prior to the
ICU admission: thus, when creatinine at ICU admission
was used, some community-acquired AKI cases may have
been missed [22-24]. In addition, patients with a slow re￾duction of renal function may have been missed by the
AKIN criteria [25]. The KDIGO definition reserved the
baseline creatinine from RIFLE as well as a small increase
in creatinine from AKIN criteria, allowing greater sensitiv￾ity than RIFLE and AKIN.
All definitions showed comparable and excellent associ￾ations with worse outcome according to increased severity
of AKI. As for the predictive ability of these criteria, all
were found to be significant predictors of increased mor￾tality using multivariate analysis adjusting for age, gender,
diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic
heart failure, and SOFA score. These findings were

identical to those of previous studies [3,4,26,27]. Patients
missed by RIFLE but identified by KDIGO, most of which
were classified as stage 1, had a longer length of ICU stay
than no-AKI patients based on KDIGO. The patients di￾agnosed by KDIGO criteria as stage 1 but missed by RI￾FLE had much higher mortality than patients without AKI
based on KDIGO (20.8% versus 5.6%, P < 0.001). Thus, we
deduced that a small increase in creatinine might be ac￾companied by increased mortality. Similar results were
observed in other studies [28,29]. A study by Wilson and
colleagues determined that the magnitude of the decrease
in creatinine generation rate may be correlated with the
severity of illness [30]. In other words, the patients with a
small increase in creatinine, accompanied by increased
mortality and longer hospital stay, could be identified by
KDIGO but not by RIFLE. The KDIGO definitions also
showed a little better predictive ability than RIFLE did, ac￾cording to the AUC curve for in-hospital mortality. For pa￾tients missed by AKIN but not by KDIGO, AKI was also
an independent risk factor for mortality, but of low risk;
and the mortality of these patients was only a little higher
than that of no-AKI patients according to the KDIGO cri￾teria (12.8% versus 5.6%, P < 0.01). In addition, the mortal￾ity of patients with AKI based on AKIN was a little higher
than those on KDIGO (32.2% versus 27.4%, P = 0.006) and
this was probably because KDIGO identified more pa￾tients in a mild severity level of AKI, with a relatively
low mortality rate. According to the AUC curve, there
was no significant difference between KDIGO and AKIN
in the predictive ability for in-hospital mortality (0.757
versus 0.746, P = 0.12). Therefore, we concluded that
KDIGO and AKIN were comparable on their predictive
ability for in-hospital mortality. So whether this small in￾crease in the mortality of these patients, identified by
KDIGO but missed by AKIN, is of high risk requires more
research. However, the study of hospitalized patients in
Japan concluded that KDIGO and RIFLE achieved similar
discrimination but that the discrimination of AKIN was
inferior [21]. Given that their conclusion is different from
ours, maybe more study is needed.
There are some limitations to our study. First, we used
the simplified MDRD formula as baseline for patients
without known baseline creatinine. In a prospective obser￾vational study, a good correlation of estimated as com￾pared with observed baseline values was found for patients
without chronic kidney disease [31]. Second, we did not
have any records of creatinine during hospitalization but
we did have records prior to ICU admission, and this may
have caused the incidence of AKI by AKIN to be underes￾timated. The AKIN criteria recommend applying only the
urine output criteria “following adequate fluid resuscita￾tion”, which is ambiguous. In our study, we did not adhere
strictly to this recommendation. Third, we received hourly
records of urine output for most patients, but for others
only the total urine volume in a 6-hour period was re￾corded. A study by Etienne Macedo and colleagues [32]
concluded that there was no significant difference between
assessing urine output every hour or the total urine volume
in a 6-hour period for the detection of episodes of oliguria,
and the latter did not decrease their sensitivity for identify￾ing patients with AKI. Finally, we did not have data regard￾ing additional factors that could influence urine output,
such as diuretic therapy.
Conclusions
The incidence of AKI in critically ill patients varied ac￾cording to the criteria used. The KDIGO criteria identified
more patients as AKI than RIFLE and AKIN did. Com￾pared with the RIFLE criteria, KDIGO was more predict￾ive for in-hospital mortality, but there was no significant
difference between AKIN and KDIGO.
Key messages
 KDIGO identified more patients as AKI than RIFLE
and AKIN did.
 AKI was independently associated with in-hospital
mortality, irrespectively of which definition was
used.
 For the patients diagnosed as AKI by KDIGO but
not by RIFLE or AKIN, AKI was also an
independent risk factor of mortality.
 KDIGO was more predictive for in-hospital mortality
than RIFLE was.
