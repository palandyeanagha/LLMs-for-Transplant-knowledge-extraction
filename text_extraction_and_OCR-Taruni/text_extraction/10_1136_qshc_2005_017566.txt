Abstract
Background: We hypothesized that time of day of surgery would
influence the incidence of anesthetic adverse events (AEs).
Methods: Clinical observations reported in a quality improvement
database were categorized into different AEs that reflected (1)
error, (2) harm, and (3) other AEs (error or harm could not be
determined) and were analyzed for effects related to start hour of
care.
Results: As expected, there were differences in the rate of AEs
depending on start hour of care. Compared with a reference start
hour of 7 am, other AEs were more frequent for cases starting
during the 3 pm and 4 pm hours (p<0.0001). Post hoc inspection
of data revealed that the predicted probability increased from a low
of 1.0% at 9 am to a high of 4.2% at 4 pm. The two most common
event types (pain management and postoperative nausea and
vomiting) may be primary determinants of these effects.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that clinical outcomes may be
different for patients anesthetized at the end of the work day
compared with the beginning of the day. Although this may result
from patient related factors, medical care delivery factors such as
case load, fatigue, and care transitions may also be influencing the
rate of anesthetic AEs for cases that start in the late afternoon.
