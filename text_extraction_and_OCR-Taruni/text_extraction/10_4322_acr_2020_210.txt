ABSTRACT
Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead not only to the development of hepatic cirrhosis, but also to 
the emergence of extra-hepatic manifestations (EHMs), such as oral lichen planus (OLP). Here, we describe a clinical 
presentation of massive, erosive OLP in an HCV-positive patient whose clinical management was difficult. Full remission 
was achieved after sustained virological response by using direct-acting anti-retrovirals. This case report demonstrates 
not only the importance of diagnosing EHMs for identification of HCV infection, but also the importance of controlling 
it for management of OLP and EHMs.

INTRODUCTION
The infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a 
characteristic immunological component in which 
there is a progressive loss of regulatory control 
over inflammation and increasing release of pro￾inflammatory cytokines capable of leading to the 
destruction of hepatic parenchyma.1,2
Persistent immune activation and systemic 
inflammation have an impact on the progression of 
hepatic disease and development of extra-hepatic 
manifestations (EHMs) involving kidneys, eyes, 
musculoskeletal system, nervous system, skin and 
mucosas.3 Due to the scarcity of specific symptoms 
and signs of HCV infection, EHMs may be the first 
evidence of this infection.4
Lichen planus (LP) is one of the EHMs usually 
observed in individuals infected with HCV. In its 
idiopathic form, LP is described as a mucocutaneous 
condition affecting middle-aged adults, with a slight 
gender predilection for females.4 Overall, LP is a 
reaction immunologically mediated by antigens and 
especially orchestrated by T CD8+ lymphocytes, which 
promotes destruction of the keratinocytes in the basal 
layer of the epithelium.5,6
The first report of an association between LP 
and HCV was published in 1991.7
 Since then, several 
hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the 
mechanisms involved in the interaction between both 
conditions. However, their pathogenesis is not fully 
understood.8
The objective of the present case report is 
to describe the diagnostic process and treatment 
approach for an aggressive oral lichen planus (OLP) in 
a patient with HCV chronic infection.

CASE REPORT
A 51-year-old male patient sought a specialized 
care center complaining of ulcerations in the mouth. 
Intense pain was making feeding, swallowing, speaking 
and oral hygiene difficult. He reported that oral lesions 
appeared 10 months earlier and were initially treated 
with acyclovir for 15 days, with no relief neither 
lesions’ improvement. His blood cell count showed a 
remarkable thrombocytopenia. A HCV serology using 
ELISA (MEIA, kit AxSYM® HCV version 3.0, Abbott 
Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois, USA) was positive 
result, and was confirmed with qualitative PCR (Cobas 
Amplicor HCV Monitor TM test, version 2.0, Roche 
Diagnostic Systems, NJ, USA) (Genotype 1a). The 
patient was treated with ribavirin and pegylated alpha￾interferon, according to the current clinical protocol 
and therapeutic guidelines of the Ministry of Health.
After seven months of treatment, the patient 
sought our service because the oral lesions were 
progressively worsening. The physical examination 
showed that the lower lip was swollen and had 
extensive ulceration with crust formation (Figure 1A). 
These ulcerative erosive lesions were scattered all over 
the oral mucosa, being surrounded and interspersed by 
whitish lichenoid lines (Figure 1B and 1C), and purple 
scaling papules on the palms and dystrophic fingernails 
were observed (Figure 2A and 2B).
An incisional biopsy of the buccal mucosa 
was performed and histopathological examination 
showed a fragment of mucosa covered by hyper￾parakeratinized stratified pavimentous epithelium, 
partially ulcerated, with intense and predominantly 
lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate arranged in a 
juxta-epithelial band, which was compatible with the 
diagnosis of lichen planus (Figure 3).
Additionally, immunohistochemical reactions 
with primary antibodies anti-CD8 (clone C8/144, 
DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and anti-FoxP3 (clone 
236/E7, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were also performed 
(Figure 4). Immune-positive cells were counted by using 
light microscope at magnification of 400x with LAS 
software V4.1. The counts of T CD8+ lymphocytes

were observed in the buccal mucosa bilaterally; C – Erosive areas in the hard palate.

and T regulatory cells (Treg) were, respectively, 1V 
and 50 cells/mm2
.
Although the skin lesions were not biopsied, 
we believe these lesions were also manifestation of 
the lichen planus. Similar lesions are reported in the 
literature.9,10
Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-DNA, anti-SSA 
and anti-SSB antibodies were analysed in order to rule 
out the possibility of systemic erythematous lupus, 
which were negative.
The initial treatment consisted of oral prednisone 
for 70 days (60 mg/day for 15 days, 40 mg/day 
for 10 days, 20 mg/day for 15 days and 5 mg/day 
for 30 days) and mouth rinsing with non-alcoholic 
solution of 0.05% clobetasol propionate (3x a day 
for 90 days). Significant improvement in the clinical 
picture was observed after 15 days of treatment with 
corticotherapy. The treatment of HCV was extended 
for 48 weeks, but the patient was considered a non￾responder at the end of this period.
The oral lesions had alternating periods of 
remission and exacerbation during the 10-year 
follow-up, being clinically controlled by means of 
mouth rinsing with 0.05% clobetasol propionate and 
prednisone tablets.
The patient evolved to hepatic cirrhosis and 
entered the transplant list. Four years ago, the 
patient was treated with direct-acting anti-retrovirals 
(Sofosbuvir 400 mg/day, Daclatasvir 30 mg/day) for 12 
weeks, which allowed sustained virological response 
(SVR) and significant improvement in the cirrhosis 
(compensated cirrhosis), resulting in his removal from 
the transplant list. The patient has been followed 
up since then (SVR) and until now he is in complete 
remission regarding the oral and cutaneous lesions. The 
patient is currently taking diuretics and non-selective 
beta-blockers for control of portal hypertension.
DISCUSSION
Hepatic diseases are usually silent, with slow 
progression and being typically diagnosed when the 
organ’s function is broadly impaired. When HCV 
infection is the cause of hepatic dysfunction, there 
is a triggering of systemic inflammatory reactions 
with deregulation of the patient’s immune response, 
which leads to the emergence of EHMs. These EHMs 
can help the clinician diagnose HCV infection. In the 
present case report, the presence of oral lesions led 
us to perform a further investigation, which resulted 
in the diagnosis of chronic C hepatitis.
Another importance of EHMs is that the literature 
seems to point to inflammatory characteristics similar 
to those observed in the progression of hepatic disease 
caused by HCV and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
diseases, such as OLP. The enhanced CD8+ response 
against HCV, 11 facilitated by the decrease in the amount 
and efficacy of Treg cells (Foxp3+),12,13 is involved in 
both fibrosis extension and rapid progression to 
cirrhosis, such as in the pathogenesis of OLP.14,15 This is 
precisely the inflammatory picture found in the present 
case of oral lesions, as there was a ratio of CD8+ 
cells to FoxP3+ cells evidencing an imbalance in the 
mechanisms of immunological tolerance. The presence 
of a great amount of T CD8+ cells is also thought to 
account for the more severe clinical presentation of 
OLP, which seems to be more common in patients 
with hepatitis C.16-19
In the present case, the lesions observed in 
the patient were not only more severe, but also of 
difficult therapeutic control. Even using systemic and 
local corticosteroids, the episodes of recurrence had 
to be controlled for several years. As one believes 
that HCV is the factor leading to deregulation of 
the systemic immune response, the therapeutic 
inefficiency of interferon and ribavirin in countering 
viral replication may have been the factor promoting 
the OLP recurrence observed in the patient.
Despite the improvement in the patient’s clinical 
picture with the use of corticosteroids, the complete 
resolution of the OLP lesions only occurred after 
the SVR was achieved with the use of direct-acting 
antiretrovirals. There are several studies in the 
literature reporting that interferon (associated or not 
with ribavirin) can lead to both establishment and 
impairment of the clinical picture of OLP. 20-22 Some 
authors believe that this fact is due to the drug’s side 
effects.20-22 On the other hand, the inefficiency of the 
interferon-based treatment in countering the HCV 
viral replication and in leading to SVR might also be 
a factor promoting exacerbation of OLP. This second 
hypothesis was further supported after the publication 
of case reports associating the involution of OLP and 
other EHMs 23,24 to the SVR with the use of AAD, 25-27
including re-establishment of immune tolerance in the

patients.28-30 These findings make us to suggest that 
the ideal treatment for cases of HCV-associated OLP 
should be coupled with the establishment of SVR.
This case report has demonstrated that it is 
important not only to diagnose EHMs for identification 
of HCV infection, but also to control it for management 
of OLP as EHMs.
