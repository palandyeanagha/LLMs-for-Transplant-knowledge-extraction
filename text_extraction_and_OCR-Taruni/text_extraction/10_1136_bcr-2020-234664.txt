SUMMARY
Midgut volvulus complicating congenital malrotation 
is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur 
in pregnancy. We present a case of intestinal infarction 
resulting from midgut volvulus in a healthy 32-week 
pregnant woman who underwent emergency laparotomy 
and small bowel resection in the setting of fetal death 
in utero. This case highlights several challenging issues 
in diagnosing and managing this uncommon condition 
which leads to increased adverse perinatal outcomes. 
Prompt investigation and definitive surgical treatment 
are required when pregnant women present with 
bilious vomiting and new-onset abdominal or back pain 
especially beyond the first trimester.
Bac kground
Bowel obstruction is rare in pregnancy with an 
approximate incidence of 1 in 10000.1
 The first case 
of intestinal obstruction in pregnancy secondary to 
sigmoid volvulus was described in 1885 where the 
patient delivered a stillborn infant and she passed 
away 2days later.
2
 Although uncommon, volvulus 
is the second leading cause of intestinal obstruction 
in pregnancy, occurring in up to 25% of cases, as 
compared with its involvement in only 3%–5% 
non-pregnant women, due to gravid uterus.2
Intestinal malrotation is a congenital abnormality 
that results from the failure of complete intestinal 
rotation and its subsequent fixation during early fetal 
development. This leads to the midgut mesentery 
being long and narrow-based in its attachment to 
the retroperitoneum, thus allowing the midgut to 
twist with relative ease around the superior mesen￾teric vascular pedicle. If left untreated, midgut 
volvulus results in a closed-loop mechanical small 
bowel obstruction and infarction of tissues supplied 
by the superior mesenteric artery. This condition 
typically presents in children.3 4 It is uncommonly 
seen in adulthood, let alone in pregnancy.
Here, we describe a rare case of midgut volvulus 
secondary to congenital malrotation in late preg￾nancy, which resulted in extensive infarction of the 
small and large bowel, as well as fetal death in utero 
(FDIU).
Case presentation
A 27-year-old G1P0 woman of 32 weeks’ gestation 
presented to our birthing suite with gradual onset 
of back pain associated with nausea and bilious 
vomiting. Her medical history was unremarkable 
aside from hyperemesis gravidarum during her first 
trimester of pregnancy. She has been complaining 
of intermittent back pain and nausea and vomiting 
antenatally but these were always regarded as 
normal pregnancy symptoms.
On presentation, she described a 2-week history 
of worsening nausea and vomiting, which became 
bilious 3 days prior to her hospital admission. 
This was associated with increasing anorexia, back 
pain and irregular bowel actions. Importantly, she 
denied recent trauma, abdominal pain, per vaginal 
discharge or fevers.
On examination, she appeared dehydrated, 
although her vital signs were all within normal 
limits. Her abdomen was soft and not tender. A 
gravid uterus appropriate for her gestational age 
was palpable. Her back was not tender to touch. A 
healthy fetal heart rate was confirmed on cardioto￾cography (CTG). She remained in the birthing suite 
for observation and was treated with intravenous 
fluids, antiemetics and analgesia.
Five hours later, she developed new-onset acute 
abdominal pain. Her abdomen was tender to palpa￾tion and worse in the epigastrium. Speculum exam￾ination was performed and revealed a closed and 
uneffaced cervix with no evidence of vaginal loss. 
Fetal fibronectin test was also negative.
However, the patient remained distressed with 
abdominal pain despite oral analgesia. An hour 
later, her abdomen appeared distended and perito￾nitic. She deteriorated haemodynamically with an 
elevated heart rate of 150 beats/min, an increased 
respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min and a fall in 
blood pressure to 100/80mm Hg. A surgical review 
was immediately consulted. Intravenous crystalloid, 
intramuscular morphine and betamethasone were 
promptly administered. CTG was reapplied but 
failed to detect a fetal heart rate. Unfortunately, a 
bedside ultrasound confirmed FDIU.
Investigations
Full blood examination, liver function test, renal 
function test, lipase and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
on admission were all unremarkable.
Serial blood tests which were performed 5hours
later revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.13), 
elevated lactate of 10.2mmol/L, leucocytosis of
21.1×109
/L, CRP of 13mg/L and evidence of acute
kidney injury (creatinine: 130mmol/L, estimated
glomerular filtration rate: 49mL/min/1.73m2
). 
Random blood glucose level was also elevated at 
12mmol/L. Her haemoglobin and liver function
remained normal.

Differential diagnosis
When the patient first presented, she was managed as having 
normal back pain and vomiting in pregnancy. Her admission 
blood tests were completely normal and therefore she was 
managed conservatively.
When the patient developed new onset of abdominal pain 
5hours later and subsequently deteriorated with shock in the 
setting of FDIU, intra-abdominal haemorrhage was suspected 
with uterine rupture and massive concealed placenta abruption 
considered as the most likely preliminary diagnosis. However, 
the absence of per vaginal bleeding and a drop in the haemo￾globin level did not support that differential diagnosis.
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and acute pancreatitis were 
ruled out due to normal liver function test, blood glucose level 
and lipase. Ruptured splenic artery aneurysm was also consid￾ered as an important differential diagnosis requiring exclusion 
due to severe epigastric pain and haemodynamic instability.
Despite being afebrile, abnormally elevated lactate and signif￾icant tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension raised suspicion 
of occult sepsis.
Treatment
Given the presence of an acute abdomen, the patient was 
promptly transferred to theatre under the care of obstetrics 
and general surgery teams. A lower uterine segment caesarean 
section was performed to deliver a stillborn female infant of 
2070g. There was no evidence of abruption, uterine rupture 
or frank haemoperitoneum. However, malodourous peritoneal 
fluid and infarcted bowel were detected necessitating a formal 
midline laparotomy. This revealed midgut volvulus in the setting 
of congenital malrotation (figure 1A). Following manual detor￾sion and active warming of the small and large intestine, 6m of 
infarcted bowel extending from mid-jejunum to distal transverse 
colon was resected (figure 1B). Due to the patient’s ongoing 
haemodynamic instability and the potential of further ischaemic￾reperfusion injury to the remaining intestines, a primary anasto￾mosis was not attempted. Instead, her abdomen was closed with 
a cusp of jejunum exposed at the skin level to facilitate moni￾toring (figure 1C) in the intensive care unit (ICU).
A relook laparotomy was conducted the next day following 
normalisation of physiological parameters. Given the lack of 
further ischaemia to the small bowel, a jejunocolonic anastomosis 
was fashioned to restore gastrointestinal continuity (figure 1D). 
In total, 2.5m of the intestine (2m of the small bowel, 0.5m of 
the large bowel) remained in situ.
Outcome and follow-up
Following 3days in ICU, the patient was transferred to the 
surgical ward with input from allied health teams. She was 
weaned off total parental nutrition over the following 2 weeks 
with minimal evidence of short gut syndrome. She received 
nutritional, psychological as well as social support and made an 
unremarkable recovery.
Discussion
Currently, there are no consensus guidelines describing the 
management of bowel obstruction and in particular, midgut 
volvulus in pregnancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first case of midgut volvulus in third trimester where extensive 
small and large bowel resection has been performed with an 
excellent maternal outcome. Despite this, FDIU was encoun￾tered and potentially avoidable. The diagnosis of midgut 
volvulus and congenital malrotation in pregnancy is challenging 
and not always immediately apparent until surgery as demon￾strated in our case. This is due to several reasons. First, the 
symptoms of midgut volvulus, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and constipation are shared with most normal pregnancies.5–7 In 
retrospect, symptoms of intermittent volvulus were suggested by 
new-onset back pain and vomiting. This was initially rationalised 
to be consistent with normal pregnancy symptoms. The transi￾tion to bilious vomiting 3 days prior to hospital presentation is 
in keeping with worsening small bowel obstruction secondary 
to progressive midgut volvulus. This subtle but critical piece of 
information was, however, not appreciated on clinical assess￾ment. The abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain, distension, 
peritonism and deranged biochemistry are late manifestations of 
bowel infarction secondary to complete mesenteric torsion.7
Second, the normal physiological changes that occur in preg￾nancy could mask the early signs of bowel obstruction.5
 For 
instance, leucocytosis and raised inflammatory markers are 
expected in a well pregnant woman, whereas this would usually 
heighten suspicion for sepsis in non-pregnant individuals. Simi￾larly, tachycardia is very common especially in late gestation due 
to increased cardiac output from the gravid uterus. In our case, 
false reassurance was created as the patient had a completely 
normal blood test and stable haemodynamic at presentation.
Third, the hesitation of using radiological investigations in 
pregnancy is a major barrier to achieving a diagnosis. The main 
reason is the fear of radiation exposure to the fetus.8 9 MRI,

Patient’s perspective
This was my first ever pregnancy. My pregnancy seemed to be 
going ‘normal’ until approximately 24 weeks gestation when 
I started to experience abdominal discomfort and upper to 
mid back pain which was associated with severe nausea and 
vomiting when I was lying in bed one night. I also experience 
hot and cold flushes, shaking and sweating. I was taken to the 
hospital two times during weeks 24 and 25 of my pregnancy. I 
was told the symptoms I was experiencing was ‘normal’ and was 
subsequently sent home with antinausea medication.
However, my symptoms persisted and they would mostly 
appear during the night while I was lying or sitting in bed. I had 
made sure to tell the midwives at all my antenatal appointments 
of my symptoms and what I was experiencing as I was unsure of 
this being my first pregnancy.
I began to experience the symptoms more frequently in the 
2weeks prior to my hospital admission at 32 weeks which also 
then included severe constipation. The weekend of my admission 
at 32 weeks, I had been vomiting yellow bile and was feeling 
extremely unwell. On the day of my admission, I was vomiting 
green bile and the pain in my back and abdomen had become 
excruciating despite the pain killers. Looking back, it ‘felt’ like I 
was dying. Everything was far from normal.
I would have gladly had tests and scans done were they 
recommended and deemed safe for my baby. I truly believe my 
‘now condition’ and circumstances could have been different had 
the imaging been performed.
Learning points
► Pregnant women presenting with abdominal pain, bilious 
vomiting and obstipation should always prompt further 
investigation to exclude small bowel obstruction and its 
underlying aetiology such as a midgut volvulus.
► Bowel obstruction in pregnancy is rare and limited diagnostic 
reassurance can be derived from a patient’s normal blood test 
and haemodynamic stability.
► Pregnancy itself should not limit the use of imaging studies 
if there is a high suspicion of intra-abdominal pathologies 
as early diagnosis could significantly decrease perinatal 
mortality and morbidity.
CT and abdominal X-rays have all been reported to be useful in 
diagnosing bowel obstruction and its underlying aetiology in the 
general population as well as in pregnancy.3–8 Diagnostic features 
of midgut volvulus on imaging include (1) a ‘whirlpool sign’ of 
the superior mesenteric pedicle and (2) closed-loop small bowel 
obstruction.8
 Characteristic features of intestinal malrotation 
on imaging include (1) location of the duodenojejunal flexure 
to the right of the spinal column, (2) the superior mesenteric 
artery located to the right of its associated vein, (3) the caecum 
located to the left of the spinal column, (4) small bowel loops 
that are predominately found in the right side of the abdomen 
and (5) colon that is predominately found in the left side of the 
abdomen. Pregnant women need to be adequately informed that 
the radiation exposure for all these studies is well below 10 rad 
which is the current maximum radiation dose that a fetus can be 
safely exposed to.9
In conclusion, despite a lack of consensus detailing the optimal 
management of midgut volvulus in pregnancy, awareness of this 
rare but life-threatening condition is critical. The combination of 
meticulous clinical assessment, short-interval serial observations 
and judicious use of radiological investigations will facilitate 
prompt diagnosis and treatment. Timely surgical intervention is 
necessary to avoid devastating perinatal outcomes.10
