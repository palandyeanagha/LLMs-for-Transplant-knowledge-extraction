In addition to producing lethal antibiotics, microorganisms may also use a new form of antagonistic
mechanism in which signal molecules are exported to influence the gene expression and hence the
ecological competence of their competitors. We report here the isolation and characterization of a
novel signaling molecule, cis-2-dodecenoic acid (BDSF), from Burkholderia cenocepacia. BDSF is
structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) that is produced by the RpfF enzyme of
Xanthomonas campestris. Deletion analysis demonstrated that Bcam0581, which encodes an RpfF
homologue, was essential for BDSF production. The gene is highly conserved and widespread in the
Burkholderia cepacia complex. Exogenous addition of BDSF restored the biofilm and extracellular
polysaccharide production phenotypes of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris DSF-deficient
mutants, highlighting its potential role in inter-species signaling. Further analyses showed
that Candida albicans germ tube formation was strongly inhibited by either coculture with
B. cenocepacia or by exogenous addition of physiological relevant levels of BDSF, whereas deletion
of Bcam0581 abrogated the inhibitory ability of the bacterial pathogen. As B. cenocepacia and
C. albicans are frequently encountered human pathogens, identification of the BDSF signal and its
activity thus provides a new insight into the molecular grounds of their antagonistic interactions
whose importance to microbial ecology and pathogenesis is now becoming evident.

Introduction
Microbe–microbe interactions are ubiquitous in
various natural ecosystems. Not surprisingly, var￾ious forms of symbiosis and antagonism have
surfaced. It has been known for a long time that
microorganisms may produce antibiotics to inhibit
or stop the growth of their competitors to gain
competitive advantages. Recently, evidence is accu￾mulating for a new form of microbial antagonism,
which was tentatively designated as signal inter￾ference (Zhang and Dong, 2004). This type of
antagonism acts not by killing, but instead by
influencing the signal-mediated gene expression of
the competitors and thus tips the balance of
interaction (Dong et al., 2004; Hogan et al., 2004).
For keeping up their competitive advantages, many
microorganisms appear to produce, release and
respond collectively to species-specific small signal
molecules to coordinate a range of important
activities, such as virulence factor production,
antibiotics biosynthesis and biofilm formation. This
cell–cell communication mechanism is commonly
known as quorum sensing (Whitehead et al., 2001;
Fuqua and Greenberg, 2002). Logically, microorgan￾isms might also boost their competitive strength in
ecosystems by interfering with the quorum-sensing
signaling of their competitors (Zhang and Dong,
2004).
Candida albicans causes various forms of candia￾sis ranging from mucosal infections to serious
systemic infections. Mutants defective in morpho￾logical transitions during infection are avirulent
(Lo et al., 1997; Braun et al., 2000; Saville et al.,
2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Therefore, this ability to
switch between yeast and hyphal-form is an im￾portant aspect of its pathogenesis. Intriguingly, the
chance of infection by C. albicans seems to be
influenced by the presence of certain bacterial
pathogens. While the fungal pathogen can be found
in various groups of patients who have undergone Received 2 July 2007; revised 27 August 2007; accepted 27 August

treatments with broad-spectrum antibiotics, it is
rarely found in individuals suffering from cystic
fibrosis that are chronically infected with Pseudo￾monas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia (Kerr,
1994). This putative antagonism seems to be at least
partially explained by the recent finding that the
long-chain quorum-sensing signal 3-oxo-C12HSL
produced by P. aeruginosa at physiological relevant
level was sufficient to inhibit C. albicans yeast-to￾hyphae transition (Hogan et al., 2004). However, C8-
HSL, the major quorum-sensing signal produced by
B. cepacia (Lewenza et al., 1999; Riedel et al., 2001),
was not able to suppress the fungal filamentation
(Hogan et al., 2004).
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) has emerged
as a major opportunist pathogen for immunocom￾promised individuals in particular the patients with
cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease
(Isles et al., 1984; Goldmann and Klinger, 1986;
Mahenthiralingam et al., 2005). The Bcc consist of at
least nine species that are phenotypically similar
but genetically distinct, and all the species are
capable of causing infections (Coenye et al., 2001;
Mahenthiralingam et al., 2005). Among them,
Burkholderia cenocepacia constitutes the majority
of the transmissible and epidemic strains and is
highly virulent (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2001,
2002). In this study, we report the identification
and characterization of a novel signaling molecule
designated as BDSF from B. cenocepacia. BDSF is a
structural homologue of diffusible signal factor
(DSF), which is the quorum-sensing signal produced
by the plant bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas
campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). In addition, we
demonstrate that the ORF Bcam0581 is essential for
BDSF production and can genetically substitute for
the DSF synthase gene rpfF in Xcc. Furthermore, we
show that the dimorphic transition of C. albicans
was inhibited by either exogenous addition of BDSF
or coculturing with B. cenocepacia.
Materials and methods
Bacteria strains and growth conditions
B. cenocepacia J2315, a cystic fibrosis clinical
isolate, was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. It is the
representative strain of the highly transmissible
ET12 clone (Govan et al., 1993). X. campestris pv.
campestris strain 8004 and its rpfF deletion mutant
8004dF were described previously (Wang et al.,
2004; He et al., 2006b). Xcc strains were maintained
at 30 1C in YEB medium (Zhang et al., 2002),
while Escherichia coli and B. cenocepacia strains
were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 1C.
The following antibiotics were supplemented
when necessary: rifampicin, 50 mg ml1
; tetra￾cycline, 10 mg ml1 (Xcc and E. coli) or 400 mg ml1
(B. cenocepacia); gentamycin, 100 mg ml1
; and
trimethoprim, 300 mg ml1
. C. albicans SC5314 were
grown either in GMM medium consisting of 6.7 g of
Bacto yeast nitrogen base (Difco, Sparks, MD, USA)
and 0.2% glucose or in minimum medium (pH 7.2).
The latter consists of K2PO4, 60 mM; KH2PO4, 30 mM;
citrate, 20 mM; (NH4)2SO4, 15 mM; MgSO4  7H2O,
0.8 mM; CaCl2, 90 mM; FeSO4, 30 mM; MnCl2, 15 mM;
and Casamino acids, 0.5%. DSF was added to the
medium in a final concentration of 5 mM unless
otherwise indicated.
Bioassay of BDSF
The assay was performed as described previously
using the biosensor strain FE58 (Wang et al., 2004).
Briefly, 4-mm diameter wells were introduced on
prepared bioassay plates and 20 ml concentrated
culture was added to each well. Alternatively, single
colonies were spotted on bioassay plates. The plates
were incubated at 30 1C overnight. DSF activity is
indicated by the presence of a blue halo around the
well or colony.
BDSF purification
B. cenocepacia J2315 was grown in LB overnight
with agitation at 37 1C. Seventy liters of culture
supernatant was collected by centrifugation and
extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate. The
crude extract (organic phase) was dried using a
rotary evaporator and dissolved with methanol. The
mixture was subjected to flash column chromato￾graphy using a silica gel column (12  150 mm,
Biotage Flash 12 M cartridge) and eluted with ethyl
acetate–hexane (20:80 v/v). The active fractions
were detected using the DSF bioassay and pooled.
These were then concentrated, subjected to flash
column chromatography again and eluted with ethyl
acetate–hexane (10:90 v/v). The purity of the col￾lected active components was analyzed by high￾performance liquid chromatography using a
C18 reverse-phase column (4.8  250 mm, Waters,
Milford, MA, USA), eluted with methanol–water
(80:20 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml min1
.

(Wang et al., 2004). BDSF was synthesized by

Construction of Bcam0581 in-frame deletion mutants
B. cenocepacia J2315, a cystic fibrosis clinical
isolate, was used as the parental strain to generate
the Bcam0581 in-frame deletion mutants. The up￾stream and downstream regions flanking Bcam0581
were isolated using two PCR primer pairs, that
is BCAM0581KO_LF (50
-ggatccctcgagatgcttgtcgaa),
BCAM0581KO_LR (50
-aagcttggtatgtcctcgtgagatgtg); and
BCAM0581KO_RF (50
-aagcttcgcacggtgtaatgcgac), BCA
M0581KO_RR (50
-tctagaggatcc acgtatcgcgtgttctcgctg),
respectively. This resulted in removal of 852 bp of
the 864 bp Bcam0581 coding sequence. To facilitate
construction, BamHI and HindIII sites were in￾cluded in the upstream fragment, whereas HindIII
and XbaI sites were tagged to the downstream
fragment. The PCR products were cleaved with
respective enzymes and ligated to the suicide vector
pEX18Tc (Hoang et al., 1998). The construct,
verified by DNA sequencing, was introduced into
B. cenocepacia J2315 by tri-parental mating with
pRK2013 (Figurski and Helinski, 1979) as the
mobilizing plasmid. The B. cenocepacia transconju￾gants were selected on LB agar plates containing
tetracycline and gentamycin. Colonies harboring
second crossover events were selected on LB agar
containing 10% sucrose. Bcam0581 deletion mu￾tants (DBcam0581) were identified by colony PCR
using the primer pair BCAM0581KO_LF and
BCAM0581KO_RR described above.
Complementation of strains 8004dF and DBcam0581
The coding region of Bcam0581 was amplified via
PCR using primers pair BCAM0581-F (50
-ggatccatg￾caactccaatcccatcc) and BCAM0581-R (50
-aagctttta￾caccgtgcgcagctt). The product was digested with
BamHI and HindIII and ligated separately to
plasmid vectors pMSL7 (Lefebre and Valvano,
2002) and pLAFR3 at the same enzyme sites. The
resultant construct was conjugated into DBcam0581
and 8004dF, respectively, by tri-parental mating.
The transconjugants of 8004dF and DBcam0581
were selected on YEB agar plates containing rifam￾picin and tetracycline and on LB agar plates
supplemented with gentamycin and trimethoprim,
respectively.
Extracellular polysaccharide and biofilm analysis
For quantification of extracellular polysaccharide
(EPS) production, 10 ml of overnight culture
(OD600B2.5) were centrifuged at 12 000 r.p.m. for
20 min. The collected supernatants were mixed with
2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol and the mixture was
incubated at 4 1C for 30 min. The precipitated EPS
was isolated by centrifugation and dried overnight
at 55 1C before determination of dry weights.
For analysis of biofilm formation, a single colony
of each strain was inoculated and grown overnight
at 37 1C with agitation in 5 ml of YEB medium. As a
positive control, 5 mM of DSF was added to Xcc
8004dF and methanol was added to the wild-type
strain as solvent control. Multiple samples were
obtained after overnight incubation and visualized
with a phase contrast microscope (Olympus BX50).
Imaging was performed using an Olympus DP70
digital camera.
Microscopic analysis and quantification of germ tube
formation in C. albicans
For testing the effect on C. albicans germ tube
formation, BDSF and other compounds were
diluted to appropriate concentrations in methanol.
The overnight culture of C. albicans strain SC5314
grown in GMM medium were diluted 10-fold in
fresh GMM medium containing the 3 kDa fraction of
fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 20%. The
3 kDa fraction was prepared by filtration of fetal calf
serum through a membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) with a 3 kDa pore size and collection of
the filtrates. This preparation was necessary as it
drastically reduced the crude serum-induced aggre￾gation but retained the potent germ tube induction
capability, thereby allowing accurate quantification.
The testing signal molecules were added separately
to appropriate final concentrations as indicated and
the cells were induced for 3 h at 37 1C. For growth
experiments, overnight cultures (OD600E1.0) were
diluted to OD600E0.06 in GMM medium and
cultured at 30 1C with agitation (200 r.p.m.). Cocul￾ture experiments were performed in minimum
medium using three B. cenocepacia strains, which
displayed a similar growth rate. Fresh bacilli and
yeast-form C. albicans were cultured together in the
ratio of 20:1 with E. coli DH5a as a negative control.
The mix cultures were grown for 15 h at 30 1C and
then 3 h at 37 1C for induction of germ tube
formation. Quantification of germ tube formation
was performed using a phase contrast microscope
(Olympus BX50) by counting about 400 C. albicans
cells per sample. Imaging was achieved using a
Leica DMR Fluorescence microscope with  100
objective and a Hamamatsu digital camera inter￾phased with METAMORPH software (Universal
Imaging, Downingtown, PA, USA).
Results
Detection of DSF-like activity in B. cenocepacia
In our preliminary screening, several environmental
isolates, belonging to Burkholderia spp. based on
16S rDNA analysis, were found capable of produ￾cing DSF-like signals when assayed using the DSF
biosensor Xcc strain FE58 (Wang et al., 2004). For
further characterization, strain B. cenocepacia
J2315, which is a clinical isolate with genome
sequence available (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/
blast/submitblast/b_cenocepacia), was obtained from
ATCC. A single colony of strain J2315 was spotted on
the bioassay plate containing the biosensor. A blue

was detected after incubation at 30 1C overnight
(Figure 1a), suggesting that B. cenocepacia J2315
may secrete a DSF-like molecule, which was tenta￾tively designated as BDSF.
Bcam0581 is the rpfF homologue of B. cenocepacia
J2315 essential for production of BDSF
In Xcc, a putative enoyl-CoA hydratase encoded by
rpfF is a key enzyme for DSF biosynthesis. Mutation
of rpfF abolishes DSF production and reduces the
DSF-mediated virulence gene expression (Barber
et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2004; He et al., 2006b). To
identify the gene responsible for BDSF biosynthesis,
the RpfF homologue was searched in the genome of
B. cenocepacia J2315 by using the BLAST program
(Altschul et al., 1990). The top hit is a peptide
encoded by Bcam0581 showing a 37.2% identity
with RpfF with an e-value of 1.8  1044. The gene is
located on chromosome 2 and encodes a protein of
32 kDa. Interrogation of the B. cenocepacia J2315
genome sequence with the protein sequence of
Bcam0581 did not reveal the presence of paralogues.
Domain analysis using the pfam database version
22.0 (Finn et al., 2006) showed that Bcam0581
contained an enoyl-CoA hydratase domain similar
to the RpfF enzyme of Xcc (Figure 2a).
The rpfF of Xcc is located within the same locus
as rpfC and rpfG, which encode a DSF sensor and
cognate response regulator, respectively. In contrast,
no rpfC or rpfG homologue was found in the vicinity
of Bcam0581 (Figure 2b), suggesting a different
origin of evolution of the BDSF system in
B. cenocepacia. The Bcam0581 gene appears to be
a single transcriptional unit and is flanked by
Bcam0582 and Bcam0580. The former encodes a
73 kDa hypothetical protein and the latter a 73.3 kDa
protein with PAS, diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) and
a phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains. This domain
structure is identical to that of PdeA from Xcc
(Xc2324), which had been shown to regulate the
synthesis of extracellular enzymes under oxygen￾limited conditions (Ryan et al., 2007). In addition,
protein blast analysis found that the peptide
encoded by Bcam0580 was about 39% identical to
PdeA. Taken together, these observations indicate
that Bcam0580 is a putative homologue of PdeA.
To verify the role of Bcam0581 in BDSF biosynth￾esis, the gene was deleted via homologous recombi￾nation. This resulted in a complete loss of BDSF
production, and expression of the wild-type
Bcam0581 gene in the deletion mutant resulted in
overproduction of the signal (Figure 1a).
Bcam0581 is a functional homologue of rpfF
It was curious whether Bcam0581, which shows a
moderate similarity to rpfF, could functionally re￾place the latter. For this purpose, the coding region of
Bcam0581 was PCR-amplified and cloned under the
control of the tac promoter in the expression vector
pLAFR3. The resultant construct was conjugated into
the rpfF deletion mutant 8004dF (He et al., 2006b).
As shown in Figure 1b, expression of Bcam0581 in
the mutant restored DSF production. Furthermore,
biofilm dispersal and EPS production were restored
to wild-type levels in the strain 8004dF expressing
Bcam0581 (Figure 3). Given that Xcc is rather
stringent in recognition and response to DSF-type
signal molecules (Wang et al., 2004), these data
suggest that Bcam0581 may produce the same DSF
signal or a closely related structural analogue.
BDSF purification and structural analysis
The active component was collected from 70 l of
B. cenocepacia J2315 culture supernatants by ethyl
acetate extraction and purified by flash column
chromatography. About 7 mg of BDSF was obtained
from the combined active fractions after evaporation
of the solvent. This was estimated at approximately
98% purity, based on the analysis by high-perfor￾mance liquid chromatography.
The 13C NMR spectrum showed that there were 12
peaks, which represent 12 carbons as stated below
(Figure 4b). The nine 13C peaks in the range of
14–32 p.p.m. were most likely from acyclic hydro￾carbons. The 1

indicated that the peak at 14.08 p.p.m. was corre￾lated with the three aliphatic protons at 0.88 p.p.m.
(Figure 4a), probably representing a terminal CH3
group. The remaining eight 13C peaks in the range of
14–32 p.p.m. represented eight CH2 groups based on
HMQC and distortionless enhancement by polariza￾tion transfer spectra, suggesting the presence of an
aliphatic chain. Among three carbon signals over
100 p.p.m., two at 118.91 and 153.43 p.p.m. were
correlated with the two olefinic protons at 5.78 and
6.34 p.p.m., respectively, and were assigned to a
double bond by HMQC spectrum. These two olefinic
protons coupled to each other with a coupling
constant of 11.5 Hz, thus establishing the cis config￾uration of the double bond. A quaternary carbon
peak at 171.34 p.p.m. should be assigned to a
carbonyl, which conjugated to the double bond
based on the 1
H-13C correlated heteronuclear
multiple bond coherence spectrum. Furthermore,
high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectro￾metry analysis of the purified BDSF revealed a
molecular ion (M-H) with an m/z of 197.1532,
suggesting a molecular formula of C12H21O2
(197.1542). Taken together, these data indicate that
BDSF is cis-2-dodecenoic acid (Figure 4c), a closely
related structural analogue of DSF. In addition, we
synthesized cis-2-dodecenoic acid and found that its
1
H and 13C NMR spectra and biological activity were
virtually indistinguishable from those of natural
BDSF (data not shown).
BDSF inhibited the germ tube formation by C. albicans
BDSF is structurally related to farnesol and highly
similar to DSF. Both were shown to inhibit germ
tube formation by C. albicans (Hogan et al., 2004;
Wang et al., 2004). For determination of the
potential inhibitory activity of BDSF against
C. albicans, the signal was added to the fresh fungal
yeast cells (Figure 5a). Farnesol and methanol were
used as a positive and solvent control, respectively.
After incubation at 37 1C for 3 h, more than 90% of
C. albicans cells in solvent control formed germ
tubes (Figure 5b), and farnesol at a final concentra￾tion of 5 mM slightly reduced the length of germ
tubes but seemed to have no effect on germination
(Figure 5c). In contrast, BDSF at a final concentra￾tion of 5 mM caused a marked reduction of germ tube
germination and elongation (Figure 5d).
The above data suggest that BDSF is a highly
potent inhibitor. Its activity was thus further
compared quantitatively with several similar mole￾cules, including DSF, 3OC12HSL and farnesol
(Figures 5e and f), using the same medium and

(lysS); aconitate hydratase (acnB) and two genes encoding hypothetical proteins (1861 and 1862). The region around the rpfF homologue
Bcam0581 of B. cenocepacia consists of the genes encoding two transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (Bcam0577 and
Bcam0584), a putative 5-oxoprolinase (Bcam0578), a PdeA homologue (Bcam0580), two hypothetical proteins (Bcam0582 and
Bcam0582a) and an AraC-type transcription regulator (Bcam0583).

growth condition as described previously (Hogan
et al., 2004). At a final concentration of 25 mM, none
of them were able to inhibit yeast growth, but
showed varied inhibitory effects on C. albicans
germ tube formation with BDSF being the most
effective, followed by DSF, farnesol and 3OC12HSL
(Figure 5f). Consistent with the previous observation
(Hogan et al., 2004), farnesol at a final concentration
of 100 mM caused about 45% reduction of germ tube
formation (Figure 5f). It is also interesting to note
that farnesol, 3OC12HSL and DSF at 100 mM did no
affect the yeast cell growth, but strikingly, BDSF at
the same concentration showed a detrimental effect
on yeast cell growth (Figure 5e). Further titration
to a final concentration of 5 mM, BDSF and DSF
resulted in about 60% and 12% reduction in germ
tube formation, respectively, whereas farnesol and
3OC12HSL had no obvious effect (Figure 5f). Inter￾estingly, even at 0.5 mM, BDSF outperformed its close
structural analogue DSF at 5 mM by reducing about
15% germ tube formation (Figure 5f).
DBcam0581 displays reduced ability to inhibit germ
tube formation when cocultured with C. albicans
To determine the ecological significance of BDSF,
we grew C. albicans together with B. cenocepacia or
its BDSF-deficient mutants as a mixed culture under
hyphae-inducing conditions. Observation under the
microscope showed that the presence of the wild￾type B. cenocepacia J2315 significantly decreased
the fungal morphological transition as a large
percentage of C. albicans cells grew in yeast-form
(Figure 6a). In contrast, majority of the fungal cells
appeared as filaments when grown together with the
BDSF-deficient mutant DBcam0581 (Figure 6b). In￾terestingly, the deletion mutant DBcam0581 formed
heavy cell aggregates together with C. albicans
hyphal cells (Figure 6b), whereas overexpression of
Bcam0581 in the mutant resumed the planktonic
phenotype and abolished the yeast-to-hyphal transi￾tion of C. albicans (Figure 6c). Quantitative analysis
found that approximately 50% of the C. albicans
cells counted were grown in hyphae-form when
cocultured with DBcam0581, which was close to the
E. coli control mix culture where approximately
65% fungal cells were of hyphae-form. However,
coculture of C. albicans with the wild-type
B. cenocepacia J2315 decreased the hyphae cell
level to about 20% (Figure 6d). The fungal hyphae
cell level was further reduced down to only about

Discussion
The results of this study show that the human
opportunistic bacterial pathogen B. cenocepacia
produces a potential cell–cell communication sig￾nal, which was structurally characterized as cis-2-
decenoic acid by mass spectrometry and NMR
analysis (Figures 1 and 4). The structure of BDSF
is similar to but not identical with the DSF (cis-11-
methyl-2-decenoic acid) signal produced by the
plant bacterial pathogen Xcc (Wang et al., 2004).
The only difference between the two molecules is at
the C-11 position where BDSF lacks a methyl group.
DSF is a well-characterized quorum-sensing signal
that regulates a few hundreds genes encoding
diverse biological functions through its signaling
network comprising RpfC/RpfG two component
system and a few transcriptional regulators (Ryan
et al., 2006; He et al., 2006a, b, 2007). Xcc belongs
to the g-subdivision of proteobacteria, whereas
B. cenocepacia is a member of the distantly related
b-subdivision. Identification of BDSF from B. cen￾ocepacia has strengthened the notion that DSF
may represent a new class of conserved signals
for bacterial cell–cell communications (Wang et al.,
2004).
The BDSF biosynthesis by B. cenocepacia is
encoded by the gene Bcam0581. This is supported
by several lines of evidence. First, the peptide
encoded by Bcam0581 shares about 37% identity
and a conserved enoyl-CoA hydratase domain with
RpfF (Figure 2), the key enzyme known for DSF
biosynthesis in Xcc (Barber et al., 1997; Wang et al.,
2004; He et al., 2006b). Second, expression of
Bcam0581 in the rpfF deletion mutant of Xcc
restored the biofilm dispersal and EPS production
to the wild-type level (Figure 3). Third, deletion of
Bcam0581 in B. cenocepacia abolished the BDSF
biosynthesis (Figure 1). Blast searches revealed the
Bcam0581 homologues in the other five Bcc geno￾movars with greater than 95% identity. They are
B. cepacia sp 383 (genomovar I), B. multivorans
(genomovar II), B. vietnamiensis (genomovar V),
B. dolsa (genomovar VI) and B. ambifaria (genomo￾var VII). The presence of the Bcam0581 homologue
in the remaining three Bcc genomovars is not clear
as their genome sequences are not yet available.
Thus, like CepIR, which is found in all strains of Bcc
(Lutter et al., 2001), the BDSF signaling system may
also be widely conserved in Bcc.
Among the several reported bacterial and fungal
signals, including the 3OC12HSL from P. aerugino￾sa, DSF produced by X. campestris and farnesol
produced by C. albicans itself, BDSF showed the
highest potency on inhibition of filament formation
by C. albicans (Figure 5). The previous assays
performed in different laboratories showed that
DSF is more effective than 3OC12HSL for inhibition
of germ tube formation (Hogan et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2004). This is consistent with our data that
treatment of the fungal cells with about 25 mM DSF
or four times more 3OC12HSL resulted in about
45% reduction in germ tube formation (Figure 5f).
Highly significantly, BDSF was able to inhibit germ
tube formation in approximately 70% of the cells at
5 mM. As DSF and BDSF differ only in the methyl
group substitution at C-11 position, revealing such a
structure–activity relationship is useful for further
drug design and development. Furthermore, our
data showed that at a high concentration (100 mM),
BDSF caused a complete growth inhibition of
C. albicans, whereas DSF and other signals had no
effect (Figure 5e). While the corresponding molecu￾lar mechanisms remain to be further investigated,
these apparent dosage-dependent dual functions of
BDSF on the fungal morphology and growth may
present an exciting prospect for treatment of
C. albicans infections.

The yield of 7 mg of pure BDSF isolated from 70 l
of cultures translates to a minimum of 0.5 mM present
in overnight cultures of B. cenocepacia without
taking into account the expected losses during the
purification process. Significantly, even at this
concentration, BDSF reduced the hyphal growth of
C. albicans by about 15% (Figure 5f), which suggests
that the signal might play a role in cross-kingdom
microbial competition in ecosystems. This specula￾tion was demonstrated by the findings that deletion
of the Bcam0581 gene significantly compromised
the inhibitory effect of B. cenocepacia on the hyphal
growth of C. albicans; and the mutant phenotype
was rescued by complementation with the same
gene (Figure 6). The ability to maintain an infection
at a susceptible host site that is likely populated by
several microbial species could be a combination of
several factors. These may include the evolved
survival mechanisms that are unique to ecological
niche as well as signal interference and commu￾nication systems that can result in a competitive
edge. There is increasing evidence that inter-genus
and cross-kingdom communication is a widespread
phenomenon (Zhang and Dong, 2004; Bassler and
Losick, 2006). The ability of BDSF to phenotypically
influence two organisms of different evolutionary
lineage underscores its potential as a cross-kingdom
and inter-genus signal, which may have a significant
impact on the ability of Bcc to establish and
maintain an infection in the host.
This work has uncovered a new DSF-like
signal from bacterial pathogen B. cenocepacia and

demonstrated its role in microbe–microbe interac￾tion under in vitro conditions. Elucidation of the
chemical structure and the gene encoding for
synthesis of BDSF, which is highly conserved in
Bcc complex, provides a new platform to explore
potential genetic and signaling mechanisms that
may modulate the physiology and virulence of these
important bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, the
finding that BDSF is a highly potent inhibitor on
C. albicans hyphal growth raises intriguing ques￾tions on the molecular mechanism of signal inter￾ference and the potential role of this signal in
competition between B. cenocepacia and C. albicans
under in vivo conditions. Particular noteworthy is
that the Bcc and C. albicans are frequent inhabitants
of human and animals (Kerr, 1994; Hermann et al.,
1999), identification of BDSF from B. cenocepacia
thus underpins the potential ecological significance
of DSF-like signals in bacteria–fungi interactions
and competitions.
