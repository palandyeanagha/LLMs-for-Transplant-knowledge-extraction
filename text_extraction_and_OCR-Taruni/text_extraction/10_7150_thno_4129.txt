Abstract
This themed issue provides up-to-date review and research articles covering the theranostic 
applications in the combined fields of protease research, diagnostics and drug development.
Key words: Biomarkers, diagnosis, drug development, molecular imaging, proteases, theranostics
Proteases, which are also known as proteolytic
enzymes, are important signaling proteins that play 
crucial roles in a number of pathological processes, 
such as cancer, inflammatory and cardiovascular 
diseases and neurological disorders [1]. Proteases 
were previously considered enzymes that only cata￾lyze protein degradation by hydrolysis of peptide 
bonds. Nowadays, proteases are recognized as excep￾tionally important molecules that are engaged in nu￾merous vital life processes. Because certain states of 
protease activity can affect, lead to or signal specific 
diseases, it is not surprising that proteases have been 
actively investigated as potential therapeutic and 
imaging targets. For instance, various novel protease 
inhibitors and protease-targeted prodrugs are under 
active clinical investigations and some of which are 
expected to enter the market in the next few years 
[2-4]. Since certain types of proteases can be used as 
biomarkers and/or prognostic markers, different 
types of diagnostics measuring proteases’ activities 
have been widely developed [5]. In addition, recent 
technological developments in molecular imaging 
have allowed detecting and imaging protease activi￾ties in living organisms using different imaging mo￾dalities. In this special issue of Theranostics, we 
would like to share ideas and opinions on why pro￾tease-targeted imaging and therapy is attractive in the 
drug development and diagnosis field through 
up-to-date review and research articles. 
This special issue contains 10 review and re￾search articles. The paper by Kim and Kim [6] pre￾sents the design of quantum dot-based molecular 
probes that can sense protease activities via fluores￾cence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 
systems. These promising protease sensors are ex￾pected to identify and contribute to the understanding 
of the specific role of proteases in particular biological 
processes and have great potential as high throughput 
drug screening tools for screening novel protease in￾hibitors as therapeutic drugs. In nature, proteolytic 
degradation often induces or sensitizes the controlled 
self-assemblies of certain proteins. Inspired by these 
unique phenomena, various self-assembled supra￾molecular nanostructures built up by enzymatic pro￾cesses have been studied. The exciting article by Chen 
and Liang [7] focuses on the concept and application 
of these enzyme-catalyzed or –regulated nanostruc￾tures for theranostics. In another review article, Chen 
et al. [8] introduces how molecular imaging tech￾niques can contribute to understanding the signaling 
cascades involved in cell death by targeting important 
kinases and proteases. The paper by Choi et al. [5]

introduces protease-targeted sensing and imaging 
applications, focuses on the strategies to develop so￾phisticated protease-sensitive prodrugs targeting 
various diseases and elucidates the importance of 
their therapeutic applications in the field of drug de￾velopment. 
A number of research articles introduce new 
theranostic materials or systems targeting specific 
proteases in vivo, in cells and in clinical samples. Yhee 
et al. [9] report fluorogenic peptides targeting two 
popular proteases, cathepsin B and matrix metallo￾proteinases (MMPs), and their applications in cancer 
theranostics. Jang and Choi [10] show a similar sub￾strate using an MMP fluorogenic peptide that can 
successfully turn into an theranostic agent when 
combined with photodynamic agents and gold na￾norods. They demonstrate both imaging and thera￾peutic applicability of this MMP-activatable photo￾sensitizing system in cellular models. Clinical transla￾tion of in vitro MMP diagnostics was also reported. 
Ryu et al. [11] exhibit an MMP diagnostic kit designed 
by immobilization of polymer-MMP probe conjugates 
and exemplify its use in monitoring early stages of 
osteoarthritis and acute inflammatory conditions of 
the knee joint by measuring MMP activities in the 
synovial fluids from patients. Two papers [12, 13]
describe methods of real-time monitoring of apoptosis 
in vivo and in cells by imaging the activity of the 
apoptotic protease, caspase-3, using bioluminescent 
and fluorescent proteins that are sensitive to caspa￾se-3. Since the most effective anticancer therapeutics 
rely on apoptosis, developing new techniques that 
enable real-time imaging of apoptotic processes will 
improve the understanding of drug-induced apopto￾sis and assist in the screening of apoptosis-related 
novel drug candidates. Lastly, the exciting paper by 
Habibollahi et al. [14] report a highly clinically trans￾latable technique by demonstrating how imaging 
protease biomarkers can improves the detection of 
esophageal adenocarcinoma in orthotopic small ani￾mal models when combined with a dual-channel flu￾orescent endoscopic system. 
The field of protease research is far-reaching 
ranging fundamental biology to drug development 
and to molecular imaging. Currently, one of the hot 
topics of research is the identification and validation 
of target proteases for drug development and diag￾nosis. Understanding the complex protease signaling 
in various disease conditions should be established to 
make these unique molecules useful in our lives. For 
successful real applications, multidisciplinary re￾search, like the combination of biological knowledge, 
engineering technologies, and clinical tools, is needed. 
Although a few examples were provided in this 
themed issue, there is no doubt that theranostics will 
play the role of locomotive, translating prote￾ase-related applications into the clinic. We thank all 
the authors for contributing their papers and hope the 
topics covered in this issue will provide new infor￾mation to readers of Theranostics.
