Abstract
The effects of short-term anoxia and hypoxia were studied in a
rabbit proximal renal tubule suspension in order to avoid the
hemodynamic consequences of clamp-induced ischemia. The
suspension was subjected to anoxia for 10-40 min and the effects
on a number of cellular transport and respiratory parameters
were monitored. Cellular respiration was measured upon addition
of nystatin (Nys) to maximally stimulate Na pump activity. Mi￾tochondrial respiration was measured in the tubules by addition
of digitonin and ADP to obtain the state 3 respiratory rate. The
release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured as an
index of plasma membrane damage. The cellular contents of K
and Ca were also measured. Results show that 10 and 20 min
of anoxia partially inhibited Nys-stimulated and mitochondrial
respiration, and partially decreased the K contents, but all these
effects were largely reversible after 20 min of reoxygenation.
After 40 min of anoxia and 20 min of reoxygenation, all these
variables remained irreversibly inhibited: Nys-stimulated res￾piration by 54%, mitochondrial respiration by 50%, K content
by 42%, and LDH release was 40% of total. Ca content decreased
slightly during anoxia, but increased up to fourfold during severe
hypoxia; the excess Ca was released during the first 10 min of
reoxygenation. The degree of respiratory impairment was iden￾tical during anoxia or hypoxia, suggesting that Ca accumulation
was not associated with the impairment. Decreasing the extra￾cellular Ca to 2.5MM decreased LDH release significantly during
anoxia, suggesting that plasma membrane damage during anoxia
may be associated with increased intracellular free Ca. Addition
of Mg-adenosine triphosphate during anoxia dramatically im￾proved recovery of all the measured parameters after the anoxic
period.
Introduction
The pathologic effects of ischemia have been extensively studied
in the kidney. By subjecting the kidney to ischemia of varying
duration, investigators have been able to describe the many
morphologic, physiologic, and biochemical alterations that occur
in the kidney as a function of time (1-6). Upon deprivation of

oxygen, proximal tubules rapidly lose K and gain Na (7, 8), and
decrease their ATP content (9, 10). Within 15 min of clamp￾induced ischemia, structural alterations are clearly observed in
the form of cellular and mitochondrial swelling and irregular
brush borders (10, 1 1). At the same time mitochondrial dys￾functions are clearly discernible (12). Subjecting the rat kidney
to 25 min of ischemia produces further ultrastructural alterations
that include the loss of brush border membranes (3), and these
are accompanied by loss in transport function. All these mal￾functions progress steadily with longer ischemia times (4-6, 10-
12), prompting extensive investigations to determine the course
of reversibility from ischemia upon reoxygenation. Both mor￾phology and function in the SI and S2 segments recover from
25 min of ischemia, after 4 h of reflow (3, 13). After 35 min of
ischemia, the morphology is reversible after 4 h of reflow but
transport function remains impaired (5). Subjecting the rat kid￾ney to 45 min of ischemia and longer causes irreversibility of
transport (1, 2, 6) and mitochondrial (6) function after even 24
h ofreflow. Similar results have been obtained with other animals
and other models of ischemia (14, 15). However, other studies
seem to indicate that reversibility of structure is achievable after
up to 60 min of ischemia (4, 1 1). Although many ofthese tubular
alterations have been described in detail, the underlying causes
for the dysfunctions remain unknown, especially the early in￾tracellular events.
Most renal ischemia studies have been performed in animals
in vivo by clamping the renal artery for varying amounts of
time, after which reflow is initiated (1-6, 10-19). Thus, anoxia
(or hypoxia) is produced simultaneously with a hemodynamic
blockage which eliminates tubule perfusion, inhibiting both
substrate support and removal of metabolic products. Therefore,
when experimental maneuvers have been applied which ame￾liorate the effects of ischemia, it has been difficult to separate
hemodynamic from tubular effects (16-19). In the present study,
we utilized a suspension of proximal tubules obtained from the
rabbit kidney (20, 21), which allowed the investigation of the
effects ofanoxia and hypoxia independently from the other con￾sequences of clamp-induced ischemia. The suspension was sub￾jected to hypoxia and anoxia ofshort duration (10-40 min) with
subsequent reoxygenation in vitro, and the effects of these per￾turbations were evaluated on a number of cellular transport and
respiratory parameters. Special attention was devoted to the role
of Ca in the observed dysfunctions, because numerous investi￾gators have suggested that Ca plays an important role in the
irreversible phase of cellular injury (4, 6, 19, 22). In addition,
the previously reported ameliorative effects of magnesium chlo￾ride-treated ATP (Mg-ATP)' on ischemic cellular injury (23, 24)
were evaluated in this preparation.

Methods
Preparation ofrenal tubule suspension
Renal cortical tubules were prepared from female New Zealand White
rabbits (Bunny Haven, Durham, NC; 3-4 kg wt) according to previously
published methods (21, 25). In brief, after the animal was injected with
heparin and anesthetized with ether, both kidneys were perfused at 370C
with a medium containing (in millimolar): NaCl (I 15), NaHCO3 (25),
NaH2PO4 (2), CaC12 (1), KCI (5), MgSO4 (1), glucose (5), lactate (4),
alanine (1), 0.6% dextran, and mannitol (25) equilibrated with 95% 02/
5% CO2 (pH 7.4). After clearing the kidneys with this solution, perfusion
was continued with the same solution to which collagenase was added
(124 U/ml), followed by the original solution to clear the collagenase.
The cortex was then excised, minced, dispersed, and washed three times
with ice-cold medium containing (in millimolar): NaCI (140), NaH2PO4
(2), BaCl2 (1), KCI (5), MgCl2 (1), and Hepes (10) (pH 7.4). The use of
BaCl2 throughout the preparative steps in the cold was instituted to obtain
tubules with total calcium contents comparable to those found in the in
vivo kidney (see Reference 26 for details). In order to remove nonvital
single cells and cellular debris, one ofthe washes involved use of a Ficoll
cushion (21). -90% oftubules in the resulting preparation were proximal
in origin and their lumens were open. The final pellet was resuspended
at a concentration of 6-8 mg protein/ml in the normal NaCl medium
containing (in millimolar): NaCl (1 15), NaHCO3 (15), NaH2PO4 (2),
CaCl2 (1), KCI (5), MgSO4 (1), glucose (5), lactate (4), alanine (1), glu￾tamate (5), malate (5), valerate (1), Hepes (10), 0.6% dextran, equilibrated
with 95% 0215% CO2 (pH 7.4).
Instrumentation
A specially designed cylindrical thermostated chamber previously de￾scribed (21) was used to achieve anoxic or hypoxic conditions and to
monitor the degree of hypoxia polarographically and spectrophotomet￾rically. Anoxia was obtained by closing the chamber and allowing the
tubules to consume all the oxygen in the solution. Hypoxia was achieved
by equilibrating the surface ofthe suspension with gas mixtures of various
02 concentrations containing 5% CO2. The Po2 ofthe solution was mon￾itored with a Clark oxygen electrode to a level of 1%, below which the
electrode was not deemed to be accurate. Because hypoxia occurred at
PO2 < 1% (27), the degree of hypoxia was determined by monitoring the
redox level of cytochrome oxidase in the tubules (21). A rapid scanning
spectrophotometer was used for this purpose (28) and the absorption of
cytochrome oxidase was measured at 605 nm, with respect to 575 and
630 nm as reference wavelengths.
Most measurements of oxygen consumption rate (QO%) were made
in a smaller closed magnetically stirred thermostated chamber of 1.6 ml
in volume, using a Clark-type oxygen electrode.
Experimental protocols
MEASUREMENTS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION AND MITO￾CHONDRIAL FUNCTION. Various parameters associated with respi￾ratory function were examined to determine the degree of dysfunction
created by anoxia and hypoxia:
Nystatin-stimulated respiration. Previous studies in our laboratory
(7) have determined that addition of nystatin to proximal tubules leads
to a rapid increase in Qo% caused by the entry of sodium from the ex￾tracellular medium and the consequent stimulation of Na,K-ATPase
activity. The Qo, obtained with nystatin addition has been shown to
equal the mitochondrial state 3 respiratory rate under normal conditions
(7). Therefore, the nystatin-stimulated Qo2 was used to measure the
maximal rate of coupled respiration obtainable in the intact tubules before
and after anoxia or hypoxia. Nystatin was added at a concentration of
160 mg/ml.
Mitochondrial function. The state 3 respiratory rate (7, 29) of the
tubular mitochondria was measured by permeabilization of the plasma
membrane of intact tubules with digitonin.(400 pg/ml) and addition of
ADP (400 ,uM). In these experiments, the tubules were suspended in a
mitochondrial solution containing (in millimolar): KCI (I120), KHIP04
(5), MgSO4 (1), glutamate (5), malate (5), valerate (1), Hepes (10), and
EGTA (2), pH 7.4. In some experiments, ADP was added prior to dig￾itonin in order to test the permeability properties of the plasma mem￾brane.
The rate ofelectron transfer from cytochrome c to cytochrome oxidase
in the respiratory chain of the tubular mitochondria was measured as
the Qo2 obtained in the presence of ascorbate (1.1 mM), tetramethyl￾phenylene diamine (TMPD) (1.1 mM), and carbonyl cyanide P￾trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1.7 MM) following digitonin
addition to tubules suspended in the aforementioned mitochondrial so￾lution.
ANOXIA AND HYPOXIA EXPERIMENTS. Each experiment was initiated
with a 20-min preequilibration of the tubule suspension at 370C in the
normal NaCl solution bubbled with 95% 0215% CO2. Anoxia or hypoxia
was achieved in the cylindrical chamber, as described above, and was
maintained for 10, 20, 30, or 40 min. After each period of anoxia, the
tubule suspension was reoxygenated for 20 min in a shaker bath under
a 95% 02/5% CO2 atmosphere at 370C. Samples were taken from the
suspension at three times during each experiment: immediately before
anoxia, immediately after anoxia, and after reoxygenation. For each ex￾periment, a tubule suspension was continuously maintained in parallel
under oxygenated conditions for the duration of the experiment. Samples
were obtained from this suspension at the same times, and the same
variables were measured and used as control values. Percent impairment
of each function was calculated using the respective control value obtained
at the same time for each experiment. At each sampling time, cellular
respiration and mitochondrial function were tested as described above,
and the percent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from the cells as
well as total cellular calcium and potassium contents were measured.
In one series of experiments, the effects of low Ca were tested by
replacing the I mM CaC12 in the normal NaCl solution with 2.5 4M
CaCl2. In another experimental group, Mg-ATP (1:1) was added to the
suspension in five aliquots, each of which added a concentration of 0.2
mM to the solution, at 10-min intervals during 40 min of anoxia. Mg￾ATP was added just before anoxia (time "0") and after 10, 20, 30, and
40 min of anoxia. No further additions of Mg-ATP were made during
reoxygenation.
Chemical assays
Total cell Ca content and total cell potassium content were measured
on a perchloric acid extract of the tubule cells using a Perkin-Elmer
(model 460) atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.,
Norwalk, CT). LDH was assayed according to the procedure ofBergmeyer
et al. (30). Released LDH from the cells was expressed as percent oftotal
LDH (released LDH plus nonreleased LDH in the cells). Total LDH
was measured after plasma membrane disruption by freeze thawing.
Protein was measured by the biuret method (31).
Materials
Collagenase (type 4) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
Mo.) or Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ). Digitonin, ny￾statin (mycostatin), Hepes, ATP, and ADP were obtained from Calbi￾ochem-Behring Corp. (LaJolla, CA). Dextran T40 and Ficoll were pur￾chased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Piscataway, NJ). Ouabain, and
Tris were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All other chemicals were
reagent grade. Nystatin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.
Statistics
All values are reported as the mean±standard error. For statistical analysis
of the differences between mean values, the unpaired Student's I test was
used. In the anoxia with Mg-ATP experiment, the paired Student's t test
was used.

protein-', and nystatin addition increased this rate by 39±1%
to 32.0±1.5 nmol 02 * min-' * mg of protein-' (n = 20). The
nystatin-stimulated Q02 was progressively inhibited as the du￾ration of anoxia was increased. Examination of the nystatin￾stimulated rate immediately after reoxygenation showed a large
degree of impairment even after 10 min of anoxia (Fig. 1 A),
linearly increasing to 63% impairment after 40 min of anoxia.
20 min of reoxygenation allowed a fairly good recovery of the
tubules exposed to 10 and 20 min ofanoxia (Fig. I B). However,
30 and 40 min of anoxia still elicited 40% and 55% impairment,
respectively, even after this period of reoxygenation.
The percentage of LDH released from the tubules increased
with the duration of anoxia (Fig. I A). The release was relatively
small (<10%) when the duration of anoxia was 20 min or less,
but increased rapidly with longer anoxia times. Most of this
release occurred during anoxia, inasmuch as reoxygenation
caused no further significant increase in %LDH released
(Fig. 1 B).
In another series of experiments, parallel measurements were
made of nystatin-stimulated Q02 and mitochondrial respiratory
function. The latter was measured under two conditions (see
Methods): ADP-stimulated Qo2 in the presence of digitonin in
a KCI medium (coupled respiration), and FCCP-stimulated Q02
in the presence of ascorbate and TMPD (uncoupled respiration).
Addition ofADP prior to digitonin elicited no significant increase
in Q02 either prior to anoxia or after 10, 20, 30, or 40 min of
anoxia (results not shown). Subsequent addition ofdigitonin (in
the presence ofADP) stimulated respiration to the mitochondrial
state 3 rate. These results indicate that plasma membranes of
the cells containing ADP-responsive mitochondria retain their
impermeability to ADP even after the anoxic insult.
The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2, plotted
as the percent control value after being subjected to the indicated
time in anoxia and 20 min of recovery. It appears that the cells
recover almost complete respiratory function after 10 and 20
min of anoxia, as expected from Fig. 1. However, after 30 and
40 mim of anoxia, a pattern of partial irreversibility of function
begins to emerge within the time course of these experiments.
After 30 min of anoxia, the nystatin-stimulated Qo2 demon￾strated a significantly higher degree of impairment than mito￾chondrial-respiratory function, as measured by the ADP- and
FCCP-stimulated Q02's. This suggests that the primary respi-

ratory impairment in this case may be due to the loss of adenine
nucleotides from the cells and subsequent decrease of Na pump
stimulation (see Discussion). After 40 min of anoxia, the im￾pairment in the nystatin- and the ADP-stimulated Q02's are
very similar to one another, and both are significantly larger
than that of the FCCP-stimulated Q02. Because the rate of elec￾tron flow through cytochrome oxidase is impaired less than the
ADP-stimulated QO2, it appears that an inhibition in the mi￾tochondrial ADP-ATP translocase may also become apparent
under these conditions (see Discussion). Therefore, differential
deterioration of cellular function is observed as the duration of
anoxia is increased. Almost complete reversibility is observed
after 10 and 20 min of anoxia; the effects of adenine nucleotide
loss are observed after 30 min, and the mitochondrial dysfunc￾tions become rate-limiting after 40 min of anoxia.
Cellular K+ content during anoxia and recovery. The K+
content of the tubules prior to anoxia was 300±7 nmol/mg of
protein. Upon initiation of anoxia, the tubular cells rapidly lose
their K+ owing to the inhibition in ATP production (7, 8). After
10 min of anoxia the K+ content was only 40% of control, and
longer periods of anoxia decreased this content another 5-10%
(Fig. 3). 20 min of reoxygenation produced complete recovery
of K+ content after 10 min of anoxia and almost complete re￾covery after 20 min. Recovery was significantly less after 30 and
40 min of anoxia. An additional 20 min of reoxygenation did
not appreciably change this situation (results not shown).

Role of calcium in the respiratory dysfunction induced by
anoxia and hypoxia. The role of calcium in the anoxia-induced
respiratory dysfunction was investigated using two different ap￾proaches. First, the relationship between total calcium accu￾mulation and respiratory dysfunction was studied. Preliminary
experiments suggested that renal tubules subjected to hypoxia,
rather than anoxia, accumulated calcium. These results
prompted an investigation into the relationship between Ca ac￾cumulation and the degree of hypoxia. The latter was measured
spectrophotometrically by the percent oxidation of cytochrome
oxidase in the tubular mitochondria (see Methods). During nor￾moxia, cytochrome oxidase has a high affinity for 02 and is
therefore almost 100% oxidized (21), whereas anoxia leads to
complete reduction (0% oxidation) ofthis cytochrome. Hypoxia
is present when the oxygen pressure within the cells is insufficient
to maintain cytochrome oxidase fully oxidized, leading to partial
reduction and impairment of electron flow (31). In the present
experiments, this was achieved by decreasing the Po2 of the
bathing medium below 1%. Under normoxic conditions, total
cellular calcium content average 16.6±0.5. nmol/mg of protein
(n = 20). As shown in Fig. 4, no change in calcium content
occurred until the P02 was decreased sufficiently to create severe
hypoxia, as measured by a partial reduction of cytochrome ox￾idase to the 10-30% oxidation level. This led to a large accu￾mulation of calcium. In contrast, a slight calcium release was
actually observed during anoxia.
The calcium accumulation observed during severe hypoxia
was studied as a function of the duration of hypoxia, as shown
in Fig. 5. Calcium content was seen to increase linearly with
time, reaching a maximum level after 30 min of hypoxia. This
process was rapidly reversible in all cases, since the tubules re￾gained their original calcium content within 10 min of reoxy￾genation.
The differences between anoxia and hypoxia were used to
determine whether calcium accumulation affected the observed
respiratory dysfunction. As seen in Table I, the inhibition of
nystatin-stimulated respiration was identical whether the tissue
was subjected to severe hypoxia (30 min), increasing its total
calcium content by 250%, or to anoxia (30 min), with unchanged
total calcium. Furthermore, the hypoxia-induced calcium ac￾cumulation was abolished by the addition of 3 ,uM ruthenium

red (Table I), an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake,
with no significant ameliorative effect on nystatin-stimulated
respiration after hypoxia. Two conclusions may be drawn from
these results: (a) calcium accumulates in the mitochondria during
severe hypoxia but not during anoxia; and (b) this accumulation
is unrelated to the respiratory dysfunction elicited by short-term
hypoxia or anoxia.
The second approach to study the involvement of calcium
with the respiratory dysfunctions induced by anoxia was to vary
the external calcium concentration in the extracellular medium
during anoxia. Decreasing the extracellular calcium from 1 mM
to 2.5 AM drastically reduced the percent LDH loss from the
tubules during 30 min of anoxia (Fig. 6). However, the low cal￾cium medium appeared to be harmful to the tubules during
reoxygenation, since the percent LDH release increased signif￾icantly in this medium whereas no significant change was ob￾served after reoxygenation in I mM calcium (Figs. I A and B,
and 6).
The respiratory responses ofthe tubules were not significantly
different in the low or normal calcium medium immediately
after 30 min of anoxia (Fig. 7 A). There was, however, a signif￾icant inhibition in the recovery of the ADP response after reox￾ygenation in the low calcium medium (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, it

appears that low extracellular calcium may play a mildly pro￾tective role during anoxia but be somewhat deleterious during
reoxygenation.
Protective effect of Mg-A TP. Addition of Mg-ATP to the
bathing medium provided dramatic protection against the an￾oxia-induced dysfunctions. In the presence of Mg-ATP, the per￾cent LDH release after 40 min of anoxia was decreased by 75%
and this was maintained during reoxygenation (Fig. 8). Some
protection of respiratory function was evident immediately after
40 min of anoxia (Fig. 9 A), in that the nystatin response was
significantly higher. The most dramatic effect of Mg-ATP was
on the recovery from anoxia, which was significantly improved
in all the measured parameters (Fig. 9 B).

ing times of short-term anoxia and reoxygenation. The impair￾ments were significant even after 10 min of anoxia and increased
progressively as the duration of anoxia was prolonged. These
results are consistent with those of Harris et al. (7), who found
that the effects of anoxia on tubular respiration were immediately
reversible only up to 4 min of anoxia. In the present study, the
effects of 10 and 20 min of anoxia could be largely reversed by
20 min of reoxygenation. Longer times of anoxia created im￾pairments that were not reversible within 20 min of reoxygen￾ation. Longer reoxygenation times were explored in some cases
(up to 40 min) with little added improvement in function (results
not shown). Similar types of results regarding reversibility of
function have been obtained by a variety of investigators using
renal artery occlusion in the intact animal (see Introduction).
The present studies allow the identification of a sequence of
impairments that occur during the early stages of anoxia, which
may persist for a long time during reoxygenation, and may be
a determinant of long-term reversibility of the proximal tubules
after an anoxic episode. The release of LDH progressively in￾creases with duration of anoxia, indicating that plasma mem￾brane damage occurs during anoxia and becomes more prevalent
as the duration of anoxia increases. This result is consistent with
the loss of brush border observed during ischemia (3-5, 10, 1 1,
13). It is important to note that all the LDH release occurs during
anoxia (Fig. I A and B) and, therefore, resealing ofplasma mem￾branes seems to occur rapidly after reoxygenation, as evidenced
in the morphologic studies of Venkatachalam et al. (13). This

Short-term Anoxia in Rabbit Proximal Tubules 2381

resealing process is also evidenced by the impermeability of
plasma membranes to ADP and the ability of the cells to reac￾cumulate potassium (Fig. 3).
A small but significant degree of irreversibility is observed
in nystatin-stimulated respiration after 10 and 20 min ofanoxia,
but a large impairment becomes manifest after 30 and 40 min
of anoxia (Fig. 1 B). Nystatin increases monovalent ion per￾meability through the plasma membrane, causing sodium to
enter the cells and thus stimulate Na,K-ATPase activity, with a
consequent increase in ATP turnover and respiration (7). Under
normal conditions, nystatin stimulates respiration to the max￾imum rate at which the tubular mitochondria are capable of
producing ATP. The Qo2 achieved with ADP in the presence
of digitonin (mitochondrial state 3 rate) is normally identical to
the nystatin-stimulated QO2 (7). Therefore, the inhibition in
nystatin-stimulated Q02 observed after anoxia could be due to
impairment in mitochondrial function, inhibited Na,K-ATPase
activity, and/or limited availability of adenine nucleotides. Mi￾tochondrial function was tested independently as the ADP- and
FCCP- stimulated Qo2's (Fig. 2) and found to be normal after
10 and 20 min of anoxia. Progressive impairment of mitochon￾drial function was found after 30 and 40 min of anoxia, similar
to that observed by other investigators (6, 12). However, after
30 min of anoxia, the ADP-stimulated Qo2 was impaired sig￾nificantly less than the nystatin-stimulated Q02 (P < 0.01), sug￾gesting that the mitochondrial dysfunction may not be the prin￾cipal cause of the severe inhibition of the nystatin response. The
Na,K-ATPase activity was not tested in these experiments in￾dependently from the availability of ATP; however, the ability
of the tubules to partially reaccumulate potassium (Fig. 3) sug￾gests that the function of this enzyme may not be appreciably
altered. Preliminary experiments (32) indicate that the loss of
adenine nucleotides from the tubules may be the most important
factor limiting nystatin-stimulated respiration after 30 min of
anoxia. The tubular contents of ATP and ADP decrease dra￾matically (55-75%) and hypoxanthine levels increase by an order
of magnitude after 30 or 40 min of anoxia followed by 20 min
of reoxygenation (32). Under these conditions, mitochondrial
respiration and the rate of ATP production could be limited by
the availability of ADP. Simultaneously, the increase in Na,K￾ATPase activity elicited by nystatin would be limited by the
cellular ATP concentration, because ATP appears to be rate￾limiting for this enzyme in the intact tubule (33). In this manner,
the limited availability of adenine nucleotides could cause re￾duction of both the Na,K-ATPase activity and the mitochondrial
respiratory response. The loss of adenine nucleotides due to an￾oxia has also been found in a variety of other tissues (22).
After 40 min of anoxia, the impairment in mitochondrial
state 3 respiration (ADP response) is equal to that of nystatin￾stimulated Q02. This decrease in mitochondrial function could
fully account for the decline in nystatin-stimulated QO2. How￾ever, an important role in this dysfunction may also be attributed
to the aforementioned depletion in cellular adenine nucleotides.
As shown in Fig. 2, the ADP response is more severely inhibited
than the FCCP response at 40 min, suggesting an inhibition in
ADP-ATP translocase activity (34). Various other investigators
have found similar mitochondrial defects in the kidney after
anoxia whether applied in vivo or in vitro (6, 12, 34-36).
Therefore, the present studies suggest that some ofthe earliest
dysfunctions caused by anoxia involve plasma membrane dam￾age, the loss of adenine nucleotides from the proximal tubular
cells, and the impairment of mitochondrial function. The bio￾chemical mechanisms responsible for these dysfunctions still re￾main largely unknown, although attempts have been made to
attribute them to cellular calcium accumulation (6, 17-19, 22),
ATP depletion (23, 24, 36), increase in fatty acyl-CoA concen￾tration (22), breakdown of membrane phospholipids (37), as
well as other possible mechanisms. In this study the first two of
these factors were investigated to determine their role in the
dysfunctions produced by anoxia.
In a variety of tissues, such as liver (22, 34), cardiac muscle
(38, 39), and kidney (6, 17-19), calcium accumulation in the
mitochondria has been observed during reoxygenation after
ischemia. This accumulation is often coincident with irreversible
cell damage, leading to suggestions from various groups that the
accumulation causes the irreversible damage (6, 22, 37, 38). In
the present studies, the observation of cellular calcium accu￾mulation during hypoxia was initially puzzling until the more
comprehensive experiments shown in Fig. 4 were performed.
Because ruthenium red prevented this accumulation (Table I),
it seems that the excess calcium is taken up by the mitochondria
(26). This uptake process requires mitochondrial energization,
as attested by the actual loss ofcalcium which occurs when com￾plete reduction of cytochrome oxidase is achieved (anoxia).
During normoxia, the mitochondrial calcium content is main￾tained in steady state because the rate of passive calcium entry
into the cells is equal to the rate of active extrusion, probably
through the Ca-ATPase (40, 41). This balance is maintained
even during mild hypoxia, down to -40% oxidation of cyto￾chrome oxidase. Severe hypoxia, however, seems to upset this
balance between cellular influx and extrusion, most likely be￾cause of the limited mitochondrial capacity to produce ATP
under these conditions (31). Cellular calcium entry would con￾tinue, but the Ca-ATPase would not be able to maintain the
efflux rate due to the limited availability of ATP. This situation
would be expected to cause an elevation ofcytosolic free calcium,
leading to mitochondrial uptake as long as this organelle remains
minimally energized. Mitochondria have been shown to take
up calcium at the expense of ATP production under conditions
of limited energy availability (42, 43).
The calcium accumulation observed during hypoxia was fully
reversible within 10 min of reoxygenation even after 40 min of
low oxygen availability (Fig. 5). This finding suggests that reduced
levels of ATP can maintain a normal cellular calcium extrusion
rate. Mitochondrial calcium accumulation did not cause any
additional damage to the cells in that no difference was observed
in the degree of respiratory impairment produced by hypoxia
or anoxia (Table I). Therefore, it seems that mitochondrial cal￾cium accumulation is not one of the limiting factors involved
in the early stages of anoxia- or hypoxia-induced respiratory
dysfunctions. These results are consistent with those of Miyohara
et al. (36), who subjected isolated liver mitochondria to anoxia
and found increasing membrane damage with time in anoxia,
leading to respiratory dysfunctions in the absence of calcium.
The clear difference in cellular calcium content between an￾oxia and hypoxia may be utilized to determine which of these
conditions are actually present at the cellular level when the
whole kidney is subjected to ischemia. For example, in the studies
of Wilson et al. (6), the mitochondrial calcium content imme￾diately after removal of the arterial clamp was elevated as com￾pared to controls. This may indicate that the cells were subjected
to hypoxia rather than anoxia, under these conditions.
The effects of calcium concentration during anoxia were
probed indirectly by lowering the extracellular calcium from I
2382 Takano, Soltoff; Murdaugh, and Mandel

mM to 2.5 AM. During anoxia, the inhibition of the Ca-ATPase
and mitochondrial calcium buffering presumably causes an in￾crease in cytosolic free calcium, which is dependent on the ex￾tracellular calcium concentration. Therefore, 2.5 AM extracel￾lular calcium would be expected to cause a smaller increase in
intracellular free calcium than would exposure to I mM Ca.
The lower calcium concentration was found to protect the plasma
membrane, reducing LDH leakage measured immediately after
anoxia by 50% (Fig. 6). However, the lower calcium did not
protect any of the measured respiratory parameters from anoxia
(Fig. 7 A). Low extracellular calcium proved to be deleterious
to function during reoxygenation, because LDH release increased
during this period (Fig. 6) and recovery of ADP-stimulated res￾piration was blunted (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the role of calcium in
these dysfunctions appears to be complex. The protection of the
plasma membrane by low calcium may indicate that the increase
in cytosolic free calcium that would normally be expected to
occur during anoxia (44), is associated with the observed damage
to the plasma membrane. Conversely, these results suggest that
the cytosolic free calcium does not appear to mediate the respi￾ratory dysfunctions elicited during anoxia. These results are
consistent with those of Miyahara et al. (36) who elicited respi￾ratory dysfunctions in isolated liver mitochondria exposed to in
vitro anoxia in the absence of calcium. These dysfunctions were
similar to those observed in kidney mitochondria after clamp￾induced ischemia (6, 12). Extracellular calcium seems to be pro￾tective during reoxygenation (Figs. 6 and 7 B), and this confirms
our previous observations (26) that long-term incubation of
proximal tubules in a low-calcium medium is deleterious to their
function.
The effects of extracellular addition of Mg-ATP were tested
in that various investigators (23, 24) have observed significant
improvements in the ability of the kidney to recover from isch￾emia under these conditions. In the present experiments, the
enhanced recovery from anoxia was dramatic. It is presently
unclear whether the improvements are due to the extracellular
ATP or due to the increased intracellular ATP levels found when
ATP is added extracellularly (45, 46). It is also not presently
known how this increase in intracellular ATP occurs, because
no transport system for ATP has been described for proximal
tubules. However, it is clear that Mg-ATP dramatically protects
the plasma membrane during both anoxia and reoxygenation
(Fig. 8). Interestingly, only the nystatin-stimulated respiration
was significantly protected during anoxia (Fig. 9), consistent with
the notion that extracellular Mg-ATP helps preserve higher in￾tracellular levels of adenine nucleotides. In the presence of Mg￾ATP, the recovery during reoxygenation was dramatically im￾proved. All the respiratory parameters and the K+ content re￾covered significantly better in the presence than in the absence
of Mg-ATP, which is consistent with findings (36) that liver mi￾tochondria recovered from anoxia dramatically better in the
presence of added ATP. These results emphasize the importance
of the preservation of intracellular adenine nucleotides in the
recovery from anoxia. By implication, the loss of adenine nu￾cleotides appears to be one of the most important factors which
contribute to the cellular damage induced by anoxia.
