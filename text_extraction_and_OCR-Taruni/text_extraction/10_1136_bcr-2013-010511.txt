SUMMARY
The UK NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence)
guidelines on management of depression in adults
recommends use of selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor (SSRI) as a first choice agent. Citalopram, an
SSRI antidepressant, is a preferred antidepressant in
those patients with concomitant chronic physical health
problems. Hyponatraemia because of syndrome of
inappropriate antiduretic hormone secrection has been
reported with SSRI antidepressants but is usually mild
and responds to fluid restriction and cessation of the
drug. We report a case of severe hyponatraemia because
of citalopram in a renal transplant patient who required
treatment with hypertonic (3%) saline, with a good
outcome avoiding any neurological complications.
BACKGROUND
The increasingly common usage of selective sero￾tonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants,
especially in elderly patients with multiple
comorbidities, has revealed an increased risk of
adverse events such as hyponatraemia. Although
this is usually mild and corrects with cessation of
the drug, in rare cases severe hyponatraemia can
occur.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 77-year-old woman presented with confusion
and unsteadiness 10 days after starting citalopram
for depression. The patient’s medical history
included end-stage renal disease of unknown cause
in 1982 and subsequent cadaveric renal transplant￾ation in 1985 with excellent graft function to date,
hypertension and depression. Other medications
included prednisolone, ciclosporin A, irbesartan
and doxazosin. On examination, she was euvolae￾mic, and had no focal neurological signs but was
confused and disoriented. She had a previous
history of a transient mild hyponatraemia after
starting of hydrochlorthiazide, which resolved on
stopping the drug, 18 months prior to this
presentation.
INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory investigations revealed severe hypona￾traemia with serum sodium of 104 mmol/L, potas￾sium 4.2 mmol/L, creatine 57 mmol/L, bicarbonate
23 mmol/L, serum osmolality 227 mmol/L,
inappropriately concentrated urine with an osmo￾lality of 341 mmol/L and urine sodium 30 mmol/L.
Serum sodium was 137 mmol/L 1 month prior to
this presentation. Thyroid function, serum glucose
and lipid profile were normal, as was a subsequent
short synacthen test. CT of the brain, chest,
abdomen and pelvis was normal. The history of
starting citalopram prior to the onset of the
patient’s symptoms, and the serum and urine find￾ings in the context of euvolaemic state (inappropri￾ately concentrated urine with a dilute serum),
confirmed the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropri￾ate antiduretic hormone secretion.
TREATMENT
The citalopram was stopped and a 500 mL/day
fluid restriction was instituted. In view of the sever￾ity of hyponatraemia and associated confusion and
potential risk of other neurological complications,
the patient was transferred to the high dependency
unit and was given hypertonic (3%) saline via a
central venous catheter. The rate of administration
of hypertonic saline was calculated as follows
Sodium deficit ¼ Total body water (TBW)
 ðdesired serum Na
 actual serum NaÞ
TBW is 0.5×body weight for a woman. For this
patient who weighed 48 kg, to achieve a rise in
serum Na of 10 mmol/L over 24 h, the calculated
sodium deficit=0.5×48×(114–104)=240 mmol.
As hypertonic 3% saline contains 513 mmol/L of
sodium, 480 mL would contain approximately
246 mmol of sodium. Therefore, this volume of
3% saline (480 mL) was administered at an initial
rate of 20 mL/h and subsequently reduced to
10 mL/h titrated to the rise in serum sodium mea￾sured at regular intervals over the next 48 h.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The serum sodium rose to 123 mmol/L 48 h later
at which point she was transferred to the renal
ward and started on slow sodium tablets in con￾junction with a 1 L fluid restriction. The serum
sodium continued to rise slowly to 130 mmol/L
over the next 8–10 days. Figure 1 illustrates the
rate of rise in serum sodium over a period of time.
The patient’s confusion resolved over several days.
DISCUSSION
Our patient was elderly and was on a salt restricted
diet because of hypertension both of which
increase the risk of development of hyponatraemia
on SSRIs. The incidence of hyponatraemia because
of citalopram reported in the literature varies from
0.5% to 32%1 and has been reported to be three
times higher than with other antidepressants.2

thought to be because of citalopram are associated with milder
degrees of hyponatraemia which improved on stopping the drug
or with fluid restriction. Two other cases report hyponatraemia
of less than 110 mmol/L.2 3 Hypertonic saline requires caution
because of the risk of osmotic demyelination particularly in
high-risk groups which include patients with alcoholism, malnu￾trition, hypokalaemia, burns and elderly women on thiazide
diuretics.4 Although calculation of the sodium deficit and rate of
administration as described above and by Adrogue and Madias5
is essential for the management of these patients, this may not
reliably predict the rate of rise of serum sodium and therefore,
frequent measurements of serum sodium are required to reduce
the risk of overly rapid correction of hyponatraemia. This case
illustrates a known but uncommon potential serious adverse
effect of commonly used SSRI antidepressant citalopram. Both
primary and secondary care physicians need to be aware of this
potential adverse effect of this commonly prescribed drug par￾ticularly in the elderly.

Learning points
▸ Hyponatraemia is a known but uncommon potential serious
adverse effect of commonly used selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor antidepressant citalopram.
▸ Severe hyponatraemia may necessitate use of hypertonic 3%
saline.
▸ The rate of administration of hypertonic saline can be
estimated by calculating the sodium deficit to achieve a rise
of around 10–12 mmol over 24 h.
▸ It is essential to titrate the infusion against regular
measurements of serum sodium in a controlled setting in
order to avoid over-rapid correction and the risk of osmotic
demyelination.
