CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells control many facets of immune responses ranging
from autoimmune diseases, to inflammatory conditions, and cancer in an attempt to main￾tain immune homeostasis. Natural Treg (nTreg) cells develop in the thymus and constitute
a critical arm of active mechanisms of peripheral tolerance particularly to self antigens.
A growing body of knowledge now supports the existence of induced Treg (iTreg) cells
which may derive from a population of conventional CD4+T cells. The fork-head transcrip￾tion factor (Foxp3) typically is expressed by natural CD4+ Treg cells, and thus serves as a
marker to definitively identify these cells. On the contrary, there is less consensus on what
constitutes iTreg cells as their precise definition has been somewhat elusive. This is in part
due to their distinct phenotypes which are shaped by exposure to certain inflammatory or
“assault” signals stemming from the underlying immune disorder. The “policing” activity
ofTreg cells tends to be uni-directional in several pathological conditions. On one end of the
spectrum, Treg cell suppressive activity is beneficial by curtailing T cell response against
self-antigens and allergens thus preventing autoimmune diseases and allergies. On the
other end however, their inhibitory roles in limiting immune response against pseudo-self
antigens as in tumors often culminates into negative outcomes. In this review, we focus on
this latter aspect of Treg cell immunobiology by highlighting the involvement of nTreg cells
in various animal models and human tumors. We further discuss iTreg cells, relationship
with their natural counterpart, and potential co-operation between the two in modulating
immune response against tumors. Lastly, we discuss studies focusing on these cells as
targets for improving anti-tumor immunity.

INTRODUCTION
Early studies of T regulatory (Treg) cells, defined as a subset of
CD4+ cells that co-express high levels of CD25, the high affin￾ity IL-2 receptor α-chain, demonstrated unequivocally that these
cells are crucial for maintenance of peripheral self tolerance as
their elimination led to development of multiple organ-specific
autoimmune diseases (1). Subsequent studies identified foxp3, a
member of the fork-head/winged-helix family of transcriptional
factor as uniquely expressed by Treg cells and allowed for more
precise phenotypic identification of these cells as CD25 alone
was insufficient due to its upregulation on activated T cells (1–
3). Endowed with highly suppressive machinery, it is now well
established that CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells regulate a diverse array
of immune responses ranging from autoimmune disease, allergies,
and transplant rejection, to infections and cancers (4). While gen￾erally beneficial in the former conditions, the inhibitory activity
of Treg cells often antagonizes protective immunity in the latter
settings. Depending on the microenvironment in which they are
found, and potential stimuli eliciting their recruitment or presence
at such sites, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are now broadly described
as natural or adaptive (5, 6). Natural CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are
the better understood of the two with the central dogma being that
the adaptive or “induced” cells are generally derived from existing
pool of naïve conventional CD4+ T cells. Regardless of their ori￾gin, they share one key feature: their ability to potently suppress
effector T cells (5). Although expression of Foxp3 generally iden￾tifies natural, thymus-derived CD4+ Treg cells, adaptive Treg cells
may or may not express this transcription factor (5, 7, 8).
Recent years have seen a surge in studies of cancer models and in
humans highlighting the elevated levels of Treg cells in the tumor
and/or in circulation (9, 10). This often correlates with poor anti￾tumor effector response, hence compromised tumor immunity
(11, 12). Whether the Foxp3+ cells widely described in many can￾cer settings are of natural or adaptive/induced type remains largely
a bone of contention. This review focuses on the current knowl￾edge about both subsets of Treg cells, their generation, phenotypic
characteristics, and ill-defined roles as described in various tumor
models and human cancers. Current therapeutic modalities geared
toward Treg depletion and how they may impinge on recruited
natural versus tumor-induced Treg (iTreg) cells are discussed.
INDUCED/ADAPTIVE TREGS, MORE THAN JUST Foxp3+
CELLS
Adaptive Tregs encompass a number of CD4+ cells with reg￾ulatory/suppressive capabilities (7, 8, 13). Although “iTregs” is
commonly used interchangeably with “adaptive Tregs,” the former
is perhaps a better nomenclature for all extrathymically derived
CD4+ Treg cells. In this context, iTreg cells range from Tr1 cells,
which are induced by IL-10, and secrete both IL-10 and TGF-β (7),
to TGF-β-producing Th3 cells (induced by oral antigen tolerizing

conditions) (8), to peripheral naïve CD4+CD25−Foxp3− cells
that become converted to Foxp3-expressing cells (13). Tr1 cells
regulate immune responses against ubiquitous commensal organ￾isms and promote tolerance in the gut, and accumulating evidence
reveal they play key roles in other facets of adaptive immune
response (7). Th3 cells on the other hand, appear critical in tol￾erance induced by oral antigen delivery (8). Both adaptive Treg
cell types are induced in peripheral sites and have been described
to generally lack expression of Foxp3 which distinctively iden￾tifies natural Treg (nTreg) cells of thymic origin (2, 3, 14). In
most tumor studies however, these cells have not been extensively
described. Most of the attention on iTregs in tumor settings has
largely focused on converted Foxp3-expressing cells mentioned
above. Since both peripherally induced Foxp3+ as well as Foxp3
non-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells (e.g., Tr1− cells) are
often discussed under the umbrella of “induced” Treg cells, for
simplicity sake, the term iTreg in this review will be restricted to
CD4+CD25−Foxp3− cells that have acquired Foxp3 expression.
In order to do justice to their contributions in tumor settings,
other Foxp3 non-expressing, peripherally induced CD4+ regula￾tory cells, specifically Tr1 cells, will be discussed separately as such
in one section and the rest of our discussion will focus on Foxp3+
peripherally converted iTregs.
NATURAL VERSUS INDUCED TREGS IN CANCER: ORIGIN
AND ACCUMULATION
Several lines of evidence reveal an accumulation of Treg cells
both at peripheral sites (spleen, peripheral blood), and within
the local tumor microenvironment [reviewed in Ref. (10, 12,
15)]. This often correlates with persistent tumor burden and poor
anti-tumor effector response (11, 12). Importantly, a low CD8+
effector T cell number is also noted relative to the high proportion
of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissue
in many cancer patients (12) suggesting active recruitment of
Foxp3+ Treg cells is a key feature of many tumors. Thus, a “guilty￾by-association” analogy means that these tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells must at least, in part, be responsible for dampening anti￾tumor immunity, namely preventing effective tumor immunosur￾veillance. One outstanding issue however is the source of these
cells, and this issue is currently a subject of debate within the
tumor immunology community.
From current knowledge, the composition of Foxp3+ Treg cells
within tumors and/or in circulation in human cancer patients
remains poorly understood. There are a few possibilities: (1) They
are nTregs recruited to the tumor site and actively expanding (16–
18); (2) They are a pool of induced, Foxp3-acquired Treg cells
(iTregs) derived from converted CD25− cells (19, 20); (3) They are
Tr1 cells (discussed in the following section). In support of the first
possibility, studies performed by Zou and colleagues demonstrated
specific recruitment of pre-existing human Treg cells into tumors
in a manner that was dependent on tumor-mediated CCL22 pro￾duction and gradient (16). Another study demonstrated that Treg
cells underwent substantial proliferation at tumor site and drain￾ing lymph node in response to TGF-β secreted by immature DCs
which themselves were a result of tumor cell modification (18). In
either study however, the possibility that iTregs were also recruited
or expanded at tumor site could not be excluded. The notion that
tumor-infiltrating Tregs are likely expanded nTreg cells was further
purported in a study that examined the TCR repertoire analysis
of tumor-infiltrating Treg and T conventional cells (17). In this
report, authors concluded that since the TCR repertoires of either
population were largely non-overlapping, the tumor-infiltrating
Tregs are likely of natural origin as a significant overlap would
have been observed if a fair amount of CD25− cell conversion to
Foxp3+ cells occurred.
Data supporting the second possibility comes from a number
of studies (19–21). One of these demonstrated that in thymec￾tomized, and anti-CD25-treated tumor-bearing mice, a popula￾tion of Treg cells converted from CD25− cells developed (20).
Anti-CD25 Treg depletion strategy has been described not to effi￾ciently eliminate Treg cells (22). So the possibility remains that
nTreg cells not touched by the treatment regimen expanded in
this system. In any case, the thymectomy would have at least
reduced any potential contribution by newly generated nTreg cells
after anti-CD25 treatment cessation. Many tumors secrete TGF-β
that may directly or indirectly induce naïve T cell conversion to
Foxp3+ iTregs (19, 20, 23) Consistent with this, another group
demonstrated that in a mouse prostate tumor model, tumor￾derived TGF-β potentiated the conversion of CD4+CD25− T
conventional cells into Foxp3-expressing, CD25+ iTreg cells (19).
However, sole presence of iTreg or nTreg cells within the tumor
need not be mutually exclusive as demonstrated by Zhou et al.
Using an influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-expressing tumors along
with HA TCR-transgenic T cells in an adoptive transfer system,
they were able to demonstrate that both de novo generated adap￾tive and nTreg cells contributed to the pool of tumor-Treg cells
(24). Thus, a more realistic view of their composition is that both
adaptive and nTreg cells contribute to the total Treg pool affiliated
with tumor microenvironment.
Tr1 CELLS IN CANCER
Not all regulatory CD4+ cells are endowed with Foxp3 suppressive
machinery. As mentioned previously, IL-10-producing Tr1 cells
fall under this umbrella of Foxp3-non-expressing cells. Tr1 cells by
their original description in the early literature are CD4+CD25−,
IL-10, and TGF-β-producing cells (7). The general consensus is
that they are derived from a pool of naïve CD4+ T cells that
are distinct from thymus-derived Foxp3+ cells. Suffice to say,
they are seemingly low in frequency in an unperturbed immune
environment but are readily detected in an environment rich in
cytokines such as IL-10,justifying their label as adaptive or induced
regulatory T cells.
Unlike CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, the involvement of Tr1 cells in
tumors has not received as much attention. There are a number
of studies showcasing the importance of these cells in tempering
anti-tumor response, some dating back to pre-Foxp3 years (25–
30). In a cohort of Hodgkins lymphoma patients, an argument
was made by Marshall and colleagues for a contributory role of
CD4+ IL-10+ Tr1 cells toward ineffective clearance of Hodgkins
lymphoma. This was in part based on their finding that these cells
were present at elevated proportions in associated lymph nodes,
and could suppress T cell response in corresponding PBMCs (26).
The co-existence of the Tr1 cells with CD4+CD25+ (presum￾ably natural Foxp3+) both of which were enriched in the lymph

nodes in this particular study makes it difficult to ascertain to what
extent, if any, the Tr1 cells played an inhibitory role. Whiteside
and colleagues have reported extensively the presence of Tr1 cells
in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients
(10). Although relatively low in frequency in circulation, they were
present in a sizable proportion in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(28). In vitro analysis of peripheral CD4+ cells in glioblastoma
patient also revealed a prominent Tr1 response against tumor cells
suggestive of an enriched population of Tr1 cells in this setting
(27). In a protocol involving adoptive transfer of in vitro-cultured
Th1-like cells to ovarian cancer patients, Tr1 cells were also shown
to contribute to the total circulating Treg pool (30). In general,
many of the analyses performed in these studies were dependent
on stimulation of patient’s PBMC with or without tumor anti￾gens plus Tr1 cell-enhancing cytokines to showcase their existence,
and demonstrate that cancer patients harbor more Tr1 cells than
healthy individuals. Perhaps, most of the Tr1 cells in the periphery
exist in precursor form and are only expanded at tumor site where
antigen is ubiquitous and key cytokines such as IL-10 are abun￾dant, similar to the in vitro simulations. The study performed by
Bergmann et al., certainly is in agreement with this notion (28).
The mechanisms by which Tr1 cells might be induced within the
tumor remains unclear. Some lines of evidence suggest that certain
factors uniquely produced by tumor cells could facilitate an IL-10-
rich environment that ultimatelyfosters Tr1 cell induction (10,27).
In one report, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpressing glioma
via Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis induced mature DCs to
express high levels of IL-10, which in turn induced CD4+ T cells
that secreted copious amounts of IL-10 and TGF-β (27). Further￾more,CD4+T cells isolatedfrom peripheral blood of glioblastoma
patient showed marked IL-10 production against tumor cells indi￾cating an enrichment of Tr1 cells within the peripheral CD4+ T
cell pool in this patient. This sentiment was echoed by another
study which demonstrated that in vitro, highly suppressive Tr1
cells were generated from CD4+CD25− T cells in the presence of
autologous DCs and irradiated COX-2+ HNSCC cells or exoge￾nous PGE2, with a cytokine cocktail that included IL-10 (29).
Like the afore-mentioned study, the overall conclusion here is that
COX-2 overexpression, and PGE2 production by HNSCC plays
a key role in the induction of Tr1 cells in this malignancy. The
Tr1 cells in this study however, were shown to have some Foxp3
expression.
One important point is that a unifying phenotype that defin￾itively identifies these CD4+ Tr1 cells is yet to be agreed upon.
Besides being CD25 negative, IL-10, and TGF-β-producing, their
Foxp3 status remains a divisive subject. Some studies showed they
express variable Foxp3 levels (28, 29, 31), others described them as
Foxp3 negative, or foxp3 status was not addressed (26, 27, 30, 32,
33). The differences between these studies may likely stem from
experimental designs although it can be argued that the stimula￾tory conditions used in some of the in vitro assays to amplify Tr1
cells are also conducive to Foxp3 induction in lieu of the fact that
conventional human T cells can upregulate FOXP3 upon activa￾tion (34). Regardless of how they are described, Tr1 cells, like their
natural counterparts, are capable of exhibiting potent suppres￾sive functions as demonstrated in some of the above-mentioned
studies.
With respect to their perceived function within the tumor
microenvironment, it remains a possibility that they co-operate
with nTregs, a notion that has been suggested by others (35). The
dichotomy that Tr1 cells are increased in frequency in advanced
cancer stage and also in patients who had no evidence of active
disease following oncologic treatments when compared with early
stage raises the possibility that they may play differing roles under
varying tumor burdens (28). On the far end of the spectrum of
possibilities is that Tr1 cells actually may play beneficial roles that
are masked by the over-representation of their “natural cousins”
within the tumor microenvironment. Perhaps the ratio between
nTregs and Tr1 iTregs may be key to understanding their con￾tribution to shaping the course of tumor progression. In sup￾port of this idea, ex vivo stimulated PBMCs of ovarian cancer
patients who had better survival outcomes upon previous infu￾sion with Th1-like CD4+ cells, contained higher fractions of both
CD4+CD25+CD45RO+FoxP3+ and CD4+CD25−FoxP3− IL￾10-producing cells compared to cells derived from short-term
survivors (30). Importantly, the ratio of the Foxp3+ nTregs versus
IL-10+ Tr1 cells was touted to be key to better outcome as the one
patient that remained cancer-free showed a dwindling pattern in
the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ cells while the Tr1 cell numbers
steadily increased with each cycle of T-cell infusion and ex vivo
PBMC stimulation. Could induced regulatory cells that present
in the form of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells be beneficial in the con￾text of tumor immunity? Perhaps some studies in the foreseeable
future may specifically tackle this question. IL-10 being a cytokine
that appears to play both inhibitory and immunostimulatory roles
(25, 26, 32, 36), an anti-tumor immunity-boosting role for IL-10+
Tr1 cells is thus, not unimaginable and the above study certainly
leaves room for such deduction. Consistent with this notion, IL￾10-producing CD4+ cells have been demonstrated to effect tumor
rejection in a murine glioma model by augmenting CTL and NK
cell response (32). Perhaps, “curative” outcome seen from a com￾bination of standard cancer treatments and immune modulatory
protocols favor an increase in a discrete, unobstructive, Tr1 cell
population with a concomitant decrease in a tampering nTreg
subset. At any rate, more studies are warranted to better under￾stand how Tr1 cells shape the course of anti tumor immunity,
and by extension, tumor progression. In addition, identification
of reliable markers to pin-point categorically their existence in
tumor mass and in circulation of cancer patients without a need
to amplify them in vitro is necessary.
DIFFERENTIATING NATURAL TREGS FROM INDUCED TREGS
HELIOS
Expression of Helios, a member of the Ikaros transcription factor
family has been described to be a part of Treg genetic signature
based on a number of gene array analysis (37, 38). In a recent
report, essentially all thymic Treg cells were Helios+but only about
70% of the peripheral pool retained their expression (39). Further￾more, in vitro and in vivo-generated iTregs failed to express Helios.
An argument was thus made that Helios expression may mark the
bona fide nTregs of thymic origin (39). Building on this obser￾vation, studies in tumor-bearing mice and human cancers have
also explored the composition of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells with
respect to Helios expression (40–42). Treg cells from peripheral

Adeegbe and Nishikawa Natural and induced Tregs
blood of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients were found to con￾sist of a population that expressed Helios (40). In human ovarian
carcinomas, CXCR3+ Treg cells were reported to be abundantly
represented in the majority of tumor-Treg cells and they co￾express Helios (41). In another study that used a xenogeneic mouse
model of malignant human brain tumor, it was demonstrated
that majority of tumor-associated Treg cells expressed Helios, and
their frequency decreased when tumor-bearing mice were thymec￾tomized prior to tumor cell implantation (42). In all of these
studies, the consensus was that the Treg cells within the tumors
are most likely natural due to their expression of this transcription
factor. On the contrary, it was reported that the vast majority of
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in a murine colon adenocarcinoma
expressed low levels of Helios and the authors concluded that
based on this phenotype, coupled with additional markers, these
are likely to be iTregs (43). In the absence of any immune pathol￾ogy in the colon however, it should be pointed out that colonic
Treg cells may be predominantly thymus-derived nTreg cells as
recently demonstrated (44). When weighed together, these obser￾vations only reinforce the possibility that the expression of Helios
on tumor-infiltrating Treg cells may not necessarily be an indica￾tion that they are derivatives of nTreg cells. Further putting into
question the reliability of Helios in resolving the dichotomy of “i”
versus “n” Treg cells are some existing reports (45–47). Using poly￾clonal or antigen-specific stimulation methods to activate T cells
derived from TCR-transgenic Rag−/− mice (hence, no endoge￾nous Tregs),Wraith and colleagues demonstrated that a substantial
fraction of in vitro-generated iTregs expressed Helios under the
latter stimulation condition (47). Another group also described
transient expression of Helios on activated human and murine T
conventional and Treg cells (45). Whether Helios positive versus
negative Foxp3+ cells simply represent different versions of the
same Treg group (i.e., n Tregs) is of particular interest given that
the profile of iTreg cells generated in adoptively transferred lym￾phopenic mice based on gene expression analysis was found to be
relatively similar to nTreg cells from normal mice (48). As Treg cells
encounter tumor-associated antigens (TAA), it remains a possibil￾ity that they become activated and upregulate Helios expression.
In this context, expression of Helios simply is not sufficient to
distinguish the origin of tumor-Tregs.
NEUROPILIN-1
Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), a type-1 transmembrane protein is yet
another molecule that is being implicated in the iTreg versus
nTreg identification issue (43, 49, 50). Using microarray analysis,
Haribhai and team demonstrated that iTreg cells induced in vitro
under TGF-β and IL-2 expressed very low levels of Nrp1 com￾pared to nTregs cells (49). In an MBP-specific TCR-transgenic
mouse model under Rag deficiency background, another report
demonstrated the existence of Foxp3+ iTreg cells in peripheral
compartments, which persisted even in athymic mice suggesting
that they were extrathymically derived (50). These cells expressed
low levels of Nrp-1. In a model of iTreg cell generation via mucosal
routes, Lafaille and colleagues demonstrated that mucosal iTreg
cells or iTreg cells generated in vivo under non-inflammatory con￾ditions also express low levels of Nrp-1 unlike nTreg cells in which
high expression levels were noted. Under inflammatory conditions
however, iTreg cells upregulated its expression (43). In tumor
settings, there is only scant data describing Nrp-1 expression in
association with sub-phenotypes of Treg cells. In one report, there
was a positive trend toward increased presence of a sizable fraction
of Foxp3+ cells which exhibited low expression levels of Nrp-1
in the tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice. In contrast, Nrp-1hi
cells predominated in the spleen suggesting that the Nrp-lo phe￾notype may represent a population of iTreg cells induced locally
within the tumor (43). Taken together, these studies allude to the
possibility that Nrp-1 expression may be a good indicator for dis￾tinguishing between peripherally induced adaptive Treg cells and
may be particularly suitable in deciphering the composition of
tumor-infiltrating Foxp3+ Treg cells.
OTHER MARKERS
Worth mentioning are a myriad of cell surface molecules and
receptors that have also been associated with tumor-infiltrating
Treg cells (41, 51–56). Garpin (GARP; glycoprotein A repetitions
predominant) was found in one study to be significantly higher on
Foxp3+ Treg cells in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (55). Lym￾phocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), a CD4 homolog that binds
MHC class II is yet another molecule that has been described
to distinguish a unique sub-population of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg
cells that expand at tumor sites (51). This study analyzed the
frequency and phenotype of Foxp3+ cells in melanoma and col￾orectal cancer patients at different stages of disease and discovered
that increased percentages of LAG-3-expressing Foxp3+ Treg cells
preferentially expanded in the peripheral blood and tumor sites
raising the notion that these cells represent a subset of tumor-iTreg
cells (51). Other studies identified TNFR2, TIM-3, and ICOS as
upregulated on Treg cells at tumor sites suggesting they may rep￾resent a distinct Treg cell subset that are generated specifically in
response to TAA (52–54, 56). In a human melanoma study, for
example, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells infiltrating tumor tissue not
only displayed upregulated expression of ICOS but also exhib￾ited a more potent suppressive activity compared to those derived
from circulating blood cells (54). While these assessments were
not particularly geared toward separating tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells into natural or induced subset, it could be insightful if their
expression patterns are considered in tandem with analysis focused
at determining the composition of tumor-Treg cells with respect to
their origin. (See Table 1 for a number of cancer studies in which
some of these markers or TCR repertoire pattern were implicated
in the suggested origin of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells.)
nTREG VERSUS iTREG IN TUMORS; A FUNCTION OF
ACTIVATION/DIFFERENTIATION STATUS?
Perhaps, a healthy dose of objectivity is ideal in our trying to piece
together the different phenotypes exhibited by Foxp3+ Treg cells
in different tumors and finding a unifying phenotype that specif￾ically identifies subsets. The increased expression of some of the
afore-mentioned molecules upon T cell activation (57, 58) raises
the possibility that the various unique phenotypes as observed in
many tumor models and human cancers may simply represent
an activation state and not an indication of a different cohort of
iTreg cells generated from peripheral non-Treg cells. For instance,
a recent study reported that the expression of GARP identifies

activated human CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells especially upon in vitro
stimulation (58). Although very few studies have demonstrated
the antigen specificity of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells (59, 60),
one might speculate that the bulk of the Treg cells infiltrating the
tumor have encountered and been activated by some TAA, hence
are antigen-experienced. Therefore, it remains plausible that the
different phenotypes as observed in different tumor models and
human cancers is a reflection of their activation status and a factor
of antigen repertoire to which the Treg cells are exposed in the
tumor and/or draining lymph nodes. In sync with this notion, a
recent study in late stage ovarian cancer patients noted a dominant
population of Helios+ activated Treg cells in disseminated tumors
(61). Another issue is whether the expression of these molecules
signals a terminal differentiation stage. We previously reported
that in humans, CD45RA-Foxp3hi cells are activated and termi￾nally differentiated (62). In a murine study, KLRG1-expressing
Treg cells were identified and also deemed to be terminally dif￾ferentiated (63). Thus, tumor-infiltrating Treg cells may well be
derived from pre-existing pool of peripheral nTreg cells but exhibit
unique phenotypic properties reflective of their activation status
and/or differentiation stage as opposed to being generated from
non-Treg precursors, hence induced.
Expanding on this issue, it has been said that tumor-infiltrating
Treg cells appear to display an effector phenotype that likely
emanates from chronic exposure to TAA (10, 64, 65). Could
expression of an effector phenotype distinguish between nTregs
from iTregs? This is unlikely given that both potentially co-inhabit
the tumor and are subjected to similar antigenic cues. Cretney et
al., opined that activated/effector Treg cells display unique phe￾notypic features that distinguishes them from naïve cells (66, 67).
In one of their studies, they described a distinct population of
Blimp-1-expressing Treg cells with an effector phenotype (67).
Given that IL-2 and inflammatory signals was shown to facilitate
their production, one might speculate that the prevalence of such
inflammatory cytokines/signals in the tumor surroundings may
favor the recruitment or generation of these functionally mature
effector Treg cells. In this context, Blimp-1 could be useful to iden￾tify effector Tregs which are derived from the natural pool versus
those induced from CD25− cells in situ. Perhaps, an evaluation of
a plethora of activation-associated markers such as described by
Cretney and colleagues may yield some clues as to which subset of
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells are natural or induced regardless of
their antigen experience.
At the genetic level, molecular analysis has revealed that while
nTreg cells show a stable hypomethylation pattern at the Foxp3
locus, iTregs generated in vitro and in vivo are fickle, present￾ing with unstable Foxp3 expression with partial hypomethylation
pattern (68, 69). Although both iTreg and nTreg in the tumor may
be indistinguishable in terms of having an effector phenotype,
assessing Foxp3 epigenetic modification patterns could be useful
to differentiate nTregs from iTregs.
TCR REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY AND ANTIGEN SPECIFICITY OF
TUMOR-INFILTRATING TREG CELLS
Currently, there is paucity of data addressing the issue of antigen
specificity and TCR repertoire within tumor-associated Treg cells
and how this information may define induced versus nTreg cells.
The notion that Treg cells accumulating within tumors might be
nTreg cells was presented by Gallimore’s lab. In one of their stud￾ies as mentioned previously, they analyzed the TCR repertoires
of Treg cells and T conventional cells within the tumor tissue
and found that they were largely distinct concluding that based
on this finding, tumor-Tregs are likely derivatives of nTregs (17).
In another study using non-TCR-transgenic mice, immunoscope￾based analysis of the TCR repertoire of tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells and T effector cells revealed that each population exhibited
a skewed and distinct repertoire indicative of clonal expansion,
hinting that the tumor-infiltrating Tregs are likely a few clones
www.frontiersin.org July 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 190 | 5

Adeegbe and Nishikawa Natural and induced Tregs
that proliferate extensively in the tumor (70). Further analysis of
CDR3 sequences revealed some public sequences that were unique
to Treg cells obtained from multiple tumor tissues but had little
overlap with T effector cells arguing against the possibility that
the Treg cells were converted from T effector cells, although based
on the limited scope of the work, such possibility still cannot be
excluded.
Treg cells are selected with TCRs specific for self peptide:
MHC constituents (71, 72) and many TAA are self antigens
(73). Furthermore, Treg cells can recognize an array of tumor￾associated immunogenic self antigens (74, 75). So, it is possible
that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells exhibit unique TCR repertoire
highly reactive against some of the TAA. Supporting this notion,
a human-melanoma-infiltrating Treg clone specific for LAGE-1,
a cancer/testis antigen that is expressed in many types of tumors
was identified in a study (76). It should be reiterated here that the
expression of cancer/testis antigens is normally restricted to male
germ cells but not in adult somatic tissues. On that account, they
are cancer tissue-specific self antigens. In another study, the same
group reported the establishment of CD4+ Treg clones gener￾ated from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of cancer patients which
were reactive against another tumor-derived ARTC1 peptide (77).
In another unrelated study, NY-ESO-1 (New York esophageal
squamous-cell carcinoma-1)-specific CD4+ T cells were gen￾erated from naïve T cell preparation upon Treg cell depletion
suggesting that Treg cells, presumably an antigen-specific subset
suppressed NY-ESO-1-specific T cell induction in cancer patients
(78). Thus, circulating tumor-antigen-specific Treg cells exist at
least in patients with certain cancers (79). While these studies sug￾gest to a certain extent, the self specificity of tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells, the issue of their origin was not addressed. How might iTreg
cells and nTreg cells in the tumor differ with respect to their anti￾gen specificity and repertoire? Answering this question requires a
clear understanding of which of these two subsets predominates
in specific cancers. Then, our efforts could expand to decipher￾ing their peptide specificity, immunodominant epitopes of such
peptides, and TCR diversity of Treg cells that may recognize them
through combination of techniques including but not limited to
cloning, proteomics, and spectratyping analysis.
TUMOR-TREG CELL RECRUITMENT AND TRAFFICKING
The recruitment of Treg cells (natural or induced) into tumors
likely involves complex, multi-step processes that ultimately cul￾minate in the high frequencies observed in many cancers. Perhaps,
the expression of certain receptors may be key to unraveling some
of these processes and sorting the suppressor cells. One potential
candidate protein is Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), the expression of which
was found to be low on in vivo-generated iTreg cells under non￾inflammatory conditions unlike nTreg cells which preferentially
expressed this protein at high levels (43). In tumor-bearing mice,
Nrp-1 expression on Treg cells was demonstrated to promote their
recruitment to tumor site via tumor-derived VEGF gradient (80).
Anecdotally, Nrp-1, the expression of which is very low in naïve T
conventional cells is under Foxp3 control as ectopic expression of
Foxp3 in these cells led to induction of Nrp-1 (37, 81). Given that
TGF-β can bind Nrp-1 in addition to inducing Foxp3 expression
(35, 82), it remains plausible that TGF-β-induced Foxp3+ iTreg
cells, armed with Foxp3-induced Nrp-1 expression, respond to
further TGF-β binding in a positive feedback loop, and ultimately
become recruited across similar gradient as the nTreg cells.
Chemokine receptor pattern while largely unexplored, could
be another critical aspect of tumor-affiliated Treg cells that could
be useful in determining Tumor-Treg sub-groups. For example,
in human ovarian carcinomas, selective accumulation of Treg
cells expressing high levels of chemokine receptor CXCR3 was
noted (41). Similarly, Treg cells that infiltrated colorectal tumor
mass preferentially expressed CCR6 which appeared to promote
their recruitment via tumor-associated macrophage production
of CCL20 (83). In skin tumor-bearing mice, CCR5 was preferen￾tially expressed on tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, which seemed to
be recruited to the tumor via its ligands, CCL3, 4, and 5 that was
produced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (84). Sim￾ilarly,CCR5 signaling appeared to facilitate the recruitment of Treg
cells to pancreatic adenocarcinoma (85). Other chemokine recep￾tors implicated in Treg trafficking to tumor sites include CXCR4,
which drives Treg cells toward tumor site via interactions with
CXCL12 that is produced within the tumor microenvironment, as
well as CCR8 and CCR10 (86–88). In the case of CCR10, hypoxia
within ovarian tumor environment promotes the secretion of
CCL28 by cancer cells which in turn enhances the recruitment of
Foxp3+ Treg cells via CCR10 (87). Furthermore, in studies of oral
squamous-cell carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, increased
frequencies of tumor-associated CCR4hi cells were reported (89,
90). Consistent with this and other reports (16, 91, 92), we have
recently identified CCR4 to be highly expressed on the majority of
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in a human melanoma study (manu￾script in preparation). Notably, their phenotype was unique and
distinct from their counterparts in non-tumor-associated periph￾eral blood. Whether these Treg cells are peripherally recruited by
tumor-derived factors such as CCL22, which is a chemokine that
is widely produced by a number of tumors, and a ligand for CCR4
(12, 65) remains to be determined and is a subject of our ongoing
investigations.
In contrast to our observations and that of others mentioned
above, one reportfound that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells exhibited
markedly reduced levels of CCR4 in HNSCC relative to circulat￾ing Tregs (61). One obvious explanation for variabilities between
these studies is that differences in tumor type, infiltrating immune
cells, and stage of disease likely impacts the phenotype of Treg
cells prevalent within tumors at time of investigation. Despite the
lack of any extrapolation from all these studies as to the natural or
induced status of tumor-Treg cells, they bring to light, the notion
that the tumor milieu likely shapes the composition of Treg cells
present within it as different Treg cell subsets express different
homing receptors based on the environmental cues to which they
are subjected (93). Thus, different tumors may exhibit distinct Treg
cell composition that reflects such properties. In this regard, eval￾uation of homing receptor expression pattern in various human
cancers may thus shed more light to whether they are locally
induced, or are expanded from a recruited natural population.
INDUCED/ADAPTIVE TREG GENERATION IN TUMORS
The mechanisms involved in de novo generation of adaptive
Treg cells are still unclear. Several lines of evidence point to the
Frontiers in Immunology | Immunological Tolerance July 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 190 | 6

Adeegbe and Nishikawa Natural and induced Tregs
suppressive cytokine milieu prevalent within the tumor environ￾ment as a major contributory factor (94). For instance, TGF-β
can induce iTreg cells and it is well established that several tumor
lines utilized in murine tumor studies secrete TGF-β (19, 95–97).
Other tumor-derived soluble factors such as GM-CSF and VEGF
may recruit or expand MDSCs which then secrete cytokines that
could potentially induce Treg cells (98, 99). Additionally, tumor￾associated macrophages or DCs may be instrumental in inducing
Treg cells or recruiting discrete subsets of Treg cells with distinct
phenotypes (83, 100).
Similar to the phenomenon of infectious tolerance (101), Treg
cells may also directly enlist naïve T cells into the regulatory
pool. In this regard, Treg cell production of IL-10 and TGF-β
(102, 103) may also modulate some naïve CD4+ T cells, convert￾ing them to cells with inhibitory function. Another possibility is
an indirect effect via modulation of DCs. Treg cells via CTLA￾4 may keep DCs in an immature state by engaging CD80 and
CD86 molecules on these antigen presenting cells (102). Such
immature DCs may induce Foxp3 or Foxp+-like phenotype, in
line with their demonstrated ability to efficiently induce iTreg cells
in vivo (104). The modification of tumor-associated APCs is how￾ever not restricted to Treg effect alone. Other inhibitory agents
produced by tumors such as IDO (105) may re-shape DCs to
become tolerogenic and in turn promote induction of Foxp3+
Treg cells (106). Taken together, adaptive Treg cell generation
may be promoted by tumor-related expression of key cytokines
and soluble factors that have the potential to induce Foxp3+
cells from existing pool of tumor-infiltrating conventional CD4+
T cells or recruit discrete regulatory CD4+ T cells from distal
sites.
In a nutshell, it is evident that the generation of adaptive Treg
cells is likely a complex phenomenon and multiple pathways may
be involved (Figure 1). Adding to this complexity is the tumor
itself: its properties such as cytokine and chemokine milieu, angio￾genic capabilities, etc. may determine or shape the generation of
these peripherally induced adaptive Treg cells.
FIGURE 1 | Generation and recruitment of adaptive/induced Tregs in the
tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells may secrete an array of cytokines
and soluble factors that facilitate the induction of Foxp3 in Foxp3− cells or
the recruitment of multiple cell types including natural Treg cells,
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), dendritic cells (DC), and
macrophages. These cells in turn may secrete inhibitory and
immune-suppressive factors such as TGF-β, IL-10, and indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that could potentially convert some Foxp3− CD4+
cells into Foxp3+ cells. Additionally, tumor-derived factors or Treg interaction
with DCs may promote generation of tolerogenic or immature DC (iDC) that
recruit distinct populations of natural Tregs. nTreg is CD4+Foxp3+ cells while
iTreg is CD4+Foxp3 variable.

Foxp3 STABILITY AS AN INDICATOR OF NATURAL VERSUS
INDUCED TREG CELLS IN TUMORS?
Addressing the issue of Foxp3 stability within tumor-associated
Treg cells, a recent report evaluated tumor-resident Treg cells.
Using reporter mice that bear melanoma, authors were able to dif￾ferentiate between “ex” and “current” Foxp3+ Treg cells (64). In
this study, it was found that majority of the tumor-Treg cells retain
Foxp3 expression and only a minor population lost its expression
providing evidence that Foxp3 expression even in an inflammatory
environment as the tumor remained stable. Since iTregs only show
a partial DNA hypomethylation pattern unlike nTregs (68, 69),
indicating a transient opening up of the Foxp3 locus, they do not
to stably express Foxp3 and may even likely lose its expression in
the absence of signals that elicited Foxp3 induction. Extrapolating
from this, it is tempting to conclude that majority of tumor-Treg
cells are likely nTregs based on their Foxp3 stability and not iTregs
as Foxp3 unstable Treg cells would otherwise constitute a sizable
fraction of tumor-Tregs if they were induced from conventional
CD4+ T cells. Evaluations such as genetic profiling of Foxp3 locus
thus may be useful in delineating what constituency Treg cells in
different tumors belong to, i.e., the “i” or the “n” family.
FUNCTION OF NATURAL VERSUS INDUCED TREG CELLS
Several questions linger as we attempt to understand the role of
iTreg cells versus nTreg cells in tumor immunobiology: is the role
of iTregs largely redundant when nTreg cells are present? If not, do
they possess similar specificity and or play similar roles as their nat￾ural counterparts? Two studies, one in a colitis model, the other
in Foxp3-deficient mice, which succumb to lymphoproliferative
disease, demonstrated that full protection from disease was only
achieved when both nTreg cells and iTreg cells were present, sug￾gesting that the function of each Treg cell group is complementary
(49, 107). As Lafaille and colleagues surmised, a division of labor
between nTreg cells and iTreg cells seems a plausible arrangement
as far as their functional roles in regulating immune responses
(13). One might speculate that given their sheer dominance and
omnipresence, nTreg cells share the greater bulk of curtailing T
cell responses while adaptive Treg cell contribution is solicited as
needed and differs on a case-by-case à la cancer-by-cancer model.
Relating to this principle, a study described the accumulation of
nTreg cells and iTreg cells in the tumor microenvironment, with
the latter possessing TCR specificityfor a defined antigen expressed
by the tumor. Suppression by cognate-antigen-specific iTreg cells
was restricted to CD4+ T cells and occurred only within the local
tumor environment while suppression of CD8+ T-cell response
was independent of these tumor-antigen-specific iTreg cells (108).
From this, one might deduce that iTreg cells evolve peripherally as
in the tumor only to control some arms of the immune response
while the nTreg cells control others.
In many colorectal cancer studies, the observation that
increased Foxp3+ Treg cells correlate with good prognosis is par￾ticularly intriguing (109). An argument has been made that the
Treg cells in this context may largely be involved in controlling
potential inflammation that could ensue in response against the
commensal bacteria present in the lower intestine if Tregs are
absent (13). Given that GALT environment is permissive for induc￾tion of iTreg cells, it is tempting to speculate that the FOXP3+ Treg
cells in colorectal cancer are mostly iTreg cells. To test this possi￾bility, phenotypic characterization, TCR repertoire analysis, and
FOXP3 methylation status of Treg cells in colorectal tumor tissues
in parallel with solid tumors from sites not heavily associated with
intestinal commensal bacteria could be a starting point.
Summarily, elucidating what environmental and molecular
cues facilitate the generation of iTreg cells and the type of role
they play particularly in various cancers would be eye-opening
and may pave way for manipulating the immune system to pre￾vent their generation in such context. At any rate, more studies are
warranted to tease out who does what and to what degree is this
division of labor shared.
TREG THERAPY: TARGETING NATURAL AND
ADAPTIVE/INDUCED TREGS
To prime and/or boost anti-tumor immune response, selective
removal or reduction of Treg cells have been carried out in a
number of murine tumor studies (12). This depletion is gener￾ally achieved via the use of anti-CD25 mAb (PC61), anti-FR4
mAb, and diphtheria toxin, the latter to DEREG mice (which
express diphtheria toxin receptor under the control of Foxp3
promoter (110–114). In humans, daclizumab (anti-CD25) and
denileukin diftitox (ONTAK, a fusion protein of diphtheria toxin
and recombinant human IL-2) treatment has also shown some effi￾cacy in some cancers, consequent to their Treg cell depletion effect
although with varying degrees of success (10, 115). Cyclophos￾phamide, a chemotherapy agent that is a part of treatment regimen
in some cancers is also known to target Treg cells by reducing their
frequencies or function (116–119). In combination with tumor
vaccination, all three agents were tested in melanoma patients
in one study. Interestingly, only modest reduction in Treg cells
(as determined by methylation status of FOXP3 intron 1 within
Treg cells) was noted in the peripheral blood of patients in the
treatment groups (120). In a recent clinical trial utilizing multi￾ple tumor-associated peptides as a therapeutic vaccine for renal
cell cancer, T-cell responses of treated patients were associated
with better disease control and correlated with lower numbers of
FOXP3+ Treg cells prior to vaccination. This revelation prompted
the incorporation of cyclophosphamide to the vaccine regimen
in subsequent study which demonstrated that reduced Treg cell
numbers achieved by this approach further improved patients’
immune responses to the tumor antigens and importantly, their
overall survival (121). The caveat to all these studies is that the
effect of these Treg cell depletion/reduction protocols have not
been evaluated on Treg cell subsets and essentially no informa￾tion is available on whether iTreg cells are more susceptible to
these regimen than nTreg cells or vice versa. Thus, critical eval￾uation of the residual Treg cell fractions not targeted by these
agents is warranted as they may represent an induced popula￾tion with phenotypic changes that make them evade depletion
regimen.
On the other hand, there is some evidence that nTreg cells are
more resistant to oxidative stress or apoptosis than conventional
T cells (122). Based on this, nTreg cells, assuming they account for
the majority of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, may be the subset that
is more resilient to therapeutic modalities aimed at eliminating
tumor-Tregs. In this regard, multi-pronged approach combining
Frontiers in Immunology | Immunological Tolerance July 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 190 | 8

Adeegbe and Nishikawa Natural and induced Tregs
multiple agents targeting “i” and “n” Tregs may be necessary to
achieve efficient elimination. While their differential expression
is yet to be assigned to either iTreg or nTregs cells, CCR4, PD￾1, and CTLA-4, which have been shown to be highly expressed
on tumor-Treg cells (123) offer potential targets for treatment
of cancers enriched in Treg cells with such phenotype. In align￾ment with this line of thinking, the combination of anti-CTLA-4
and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in a mouse B16 melanoma
study led to substantial reduction in Treg cells as well as myeloid
cells with a concomitant increase in tumor-infiltrating effector
T cells (124). Agonist antibody against Glucocorticoid-induced
tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related protein (GITR), also
expressed on Treg cells (125), is another treatment route that holds
promise. In a murine model of melanoma, its administration
promoted potent anti-tumor immune response (126). Similarly,
in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody, anti-GITR adminis￾tration evoked regression of established fibrosarcoma and colon
carcinoma in other studies (127, 128). In either case, the pos￾itive outcomes were ascribed to anti-GITR antibody-mediated
attenuation of Treg function or decreased intra-tumoral Treg
cell accumulation, in addition to augmented CD+ T-cell effector
response (126–128). For advanced melanoma,it is worth mention￾ing that administration of humanized anti-CTLA-4, ipilimumab
improved survival of patients with metastatic melanoma in a
clinical trial (129). In our recent investigations, we found that
tumor-infiltrating T cells contained a higher frequency of effec￾tor Tregs with activated phenotypes compared with peripheral
blood. Correspondingly, Tregs with a naive phenotype were barely
detected in tumors while peripheral blood contained both naïve
and effector Tregs. These tumor-infiltrating effector Tregs domi￾nantly expressed CCR4, proposing CCR4 as a possible target for
Treg control (manuscript in preparation).
The finding that human adaptive CD4+FOXP3+ Treg cells
which express CD39, and CD73, and produce adenosine was
described by Whiteside and co-workers (130). They demonstrated
in vitro, the generation of iTreg cells with similar phenotype
(except for FOXP3) in co-cultures simulating some of the fea￾tures unique to the human cancer in which equivalent Treg cells
were observed (131). They found that both adenosine and PGE2
produced by these iTreg cells co-operate in mounting strong
suppressive function against autologous T effector cells. Thus,
Whiteside proposed that targeting adaptive Treg cells by inter￾fering with adenosinergic pathways and PGE2 production could
be a viable therapeutic platform to disarm iTreg cells in human
cancers (132).
Lastly, methods aimed at disrupting iTreg cell induction such as
interfering with TFG-β signaling in relevant tumors could be com￾plementary approaches to vaccination. Using siRNA-mediated
downregulation of TGF-β production by B16 melanoma cells, this
idea was explored by Mills and colleagues and they reported that
tumor growth was hampered (133). This coincided with reduced
tumor-Treg cell numbers although it was not clear as to whether
this reduction affected iTreg cells as we might postulate based on
experimental design.
Worth mentioning is the issue of Treg function at the inter￾face of autoimmunity and cancer. The pivotal and positive role of
Treg cells is exemplified in mice as well as IPEX patients in which
impaired Foxp3+ Treg cell development culminates in wholesale
breakdown of immune tolerance (1, 134, 135). When placed in
the context of tumors however, Treg suppressive function appears
for the most part, to result in unfavorable prognosis. In fact, stud￾ies that portray Treg presence within the tumor in a bad light,
i.e., inhibiting anti-tumor response outweigh those demonstrat￾ing they may have favorable contributions in cancer (10–12). In
a recent report, melanoma patients who had better response fol￾lowing treatment with high dose IL-2 plus vaccine had higher
Treg frequencies portraying a correlation between Tregs and bet￾ter response against tumor (136). Thus, therapeutic strategies
that are focused on Treg reduction in order to promote tumor
clearance need to take this apparent duality in Treg function into
account. More importantly is the effect such depletion may have
on elevating a patient’s risk for developing autoimmune con￾ditions especially if systemic Treg depleting routes are utilized.
In this regard, localized Treg reduction by intratumoral admin￾istration of Treg depleting agents which has shown efficacy at
reducing tumor burden in mice (127) may offer a more favor￾able treatment platform without the inherent risk of the global
Treg elimination assuming the tumor is accessible. Furthermore,
since Treg cells in tumor environment appear to be of the effector
Treg phenotype and may exhibit augmented suppressive activity
when compared to those in circulation (64, 137–139), localized
Treg modulation approach could be a viable option to target
only a subset of highly suppressive, effector Treg cells based on
specific molecules which they uniquely upregulate in response
to tumor antigens. By so doing, the bulk of nTreg cells are left
intact while only those “in action” are removed. This should be
a feasible approach as we have recently tested the effect of anti￾CCR4 antibody on subsets of human Treg cells in melanoma
patients and found it to efficiently eliminate a population of
CCR4-expressing effector Tregs while sparing naïve Treg popu￾lations (manuscript in preparation). Until we have some evidence
of the nature and extent of the contributions of nTregs and
iTregs in various tumors, treading carefully on indiscriminate
Treg depletion for cancer therapy however seems a reasonable
proposition.
PERSPECTIVES
Different subsets of Treg cells may be committed to regulate
specific arms of immune responses (140). Understanding the
functional capabilities of both iTreg cells and nTreg cells will no
doubt help in guiding future treatment platforms. A number of
possibilities exist: their elimination from the tumor microenvi￾ronment, blocking their ability to produce a number of immune￾suppressive/immune-altering molecules such as adenosine, PGE2,
perforin, and granzyme B, targeting anti-apoptotic pathways, dis￾rupting their ability to proliferate and or persist in tumors, etc. The
list is not conclusive as our understanding continues to expand
about the nature of Treg cells that prevail in different cancer types.
Thus, additional investigations are necessary to first determine
whether the variabilities seen among different cancer studies with
respect to phenotype associated with the tumor-Treg cells relate
to their origin, i.e., are they natural or peripherally iTreg cells.
From such information, we may be able to optimize Treg cell￾targeted approaches to reduce or eliminate not just a major subset

Adeegbe and Nishikawa Natural and induced Tregs
that is prevalent within the tumor, but a minor subset that could
contribute to hindering optimal therapeutic success in the set￾tings where their presence is related to poor survival. To this end,
designing antibodies against some of the molecules that appear to
preferentially mark Treg cells infiltrating tumors may be a good
investigational direction worth pursuing in our quest to treat
cancers. It will be interesting to see whether such studies reveal
information about the effect of treatment on subsets of Treg cells
that are affected, and those that are resistant to modulation. At
any rate, treatment modalities focused on elimination of Tregs
or disruption of their function to bolster anti-tumor immunity
should take into account the differences between cancer types, the
subset of the Tregs that predominate within the tumor, and their
recruitment dynamics.
