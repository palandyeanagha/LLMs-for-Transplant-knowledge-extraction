Hepatitis E 
Outbreak, Dadaab 
Refugee Camp, 
Kenya, 2012
To the Editor: Hepatitis E vi￾rus (HEV) is transmitted through 
the fecal-oral route and is a common 
cause of viral hepatitis in developing 
countries. HEV outbreaks have been 
documented among forcibly displaced 
persons living in camps in East Africa, 
but for >10 years, no cases were docu￾mented among Somali refugees (1,2). 
On August 15, 2012, the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) in Nairobi, Kenya, was noti￾fied of a cluster of acute jaundice syn￾drome (AJS) cases in refugee camps 
in Dadaab, Kenya. On September 5, 
a CDC epidemiologist assisted the 
United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) and its part￾ners in assessing AJS case-patients in 
the camp, enhancing surveillance, and 
improving medical management of 
case-patients. We present the epidemi￾ologic and laboratory findings for the 
AJS cases (defined as acute onset of 
scleral icterus not due to another un￾derlying condition) identified during 
this outbreak. 
Dadaab refugee camp is located in 
eastern Kenya near the border with So￾malia. It has existed since 1991 and is 
the largest refugee camp in the world. 
Dadaab is composed of 5 smaller 
camps: Dagahaley, Hagadera, Ifo, 
Ifo II, and Kambioos. As of Decem￾ber 2012, a total of 460,000 refugees, 
mainly Somalians, were living in the 
camps; >25% were recent arrivals dis￾placed by the mid-2011 famine in the 
Horn of Africa (3). Overcrowding and 
poor sanitation have led to outbreaks 
of enteric diseases, including cholera 
and shigellosis (4); in September 2012, 
an outbreak of cholera occurred simul￾taneously with the AJS outbreak.
During July 2–November 30, 
2012, a total of 339 AJS cases were 
reported from the camps and 2 nearby 
villages: 232 (68.4%) from Ifo II, 57 
(16.8%) from Kambioos, 26 (7.7%) 
from Ifo, 12 (3.5%) from Dagahaley, 
10 (3.0%) from Hagadera, and 1 each 
(0.6%) from the nearby Kenyan vil￾lages of Biyamadow and Darkanley. 
The epidemic curve of the outbreak is 
shown in the Figure.
Of the 339 AJS case-patients, 
184 (54.3%) were female. The over￾all median age was 23.5 years (range 
1 month−91 years). The median age 
among female and male residents was 
24 years and 20 years, respectively. 
Among the 134 women of reproduc￾tive age (15−49 years), 72 (53.7%) 
reported being pregnant; the median 
gestational age was 17.4 weeks (range 
8.7-35.3 weeks). Death was reported 
for 10 of the 339 case-patients (case￾fatality ratio 2.9%), 9 of whom were 
postpartum mothers (case-fatality ra￾tio 12.5%) and 1 a 2-year-old child. 
Serum samples were obtained 
from 170 (50.1%) AJS case-patients 
for testing at the Kenya Medical Re￾search Institute/CDC laboratories in 
Nairobi, Kenya. Of the 170 samples, 
148 were tested for hepatitis E vi￾rus (HEV) IgM by using an ELISA

latrines and hygiene messaging) were initiated by health authorities.

(Diagnostic Systems, Saronno, Italy), 
and 93 were tested for HEV RNA by 
using the GeneAmp Gold RNA PCR 
Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA). Of the 170 
samples tested, 131 (77.1%) were 
positive for HEV IgM, HEV RNA, or 
both: 120 (81.1%) of 148 tested for 
HEV IgM and 48 (51.6%) of 93 tested 
for HEV RNA were positive. In re￾sponse to the outbreak, UNHCR and 
partners initiated control measures, 
including training of health care work￾ers, increasing community awareness, 
improving hygiene promotion activi￾ties, and hastening latrine construction.
The outbreak also affected refu￾gee resettlement to the United States 
and other countries. At the onset of the 
outbreak, ≈100 Dadaab refugees per 
month were scheduled for US resettle￾ment. The incubation period for HEV 
is 15–60 days (5); thus, there was con￾cern that refugees could become ill in 
transit or within weeks of US resettle￾ment. Acute HEV infection, including 
progression to fulminant hepatitis, had 
been reported among travelers return￾ing from regions where the disease 
is endemic (6). As a precaution, the 
International Organization for Migra￾tion and CDC conducted heightened 
AJS surveillance during pre-departure 
and arrival health screenings. As of 
February 2013, no cases of AJS were 
reported among refugees from Dada￾ab who resettled in the United States.
Dadaab has faced grave insecu￾rity: aid workers were abducted from 
the camp in late 2011, and Dadaab 
has experienced numerous blasts from 
explosive devices (7). Thus, UNHCR 
and CDC have been limited in their 
capacity to collect data and conduct 
a thorough outbreak investigation to 
identify risk factors. An earlier study 
in the Shebelle region of Somalia sug￾gested an increased incidence of HEV 
during the rainy season and elevated 
risk for infection in villages dependent 
on river water (8). Further evaluation is 
needed to identify the risk factors for 
HEV transmission and HEV-associated 
deaths in this region, including the role 
of person-to-person transmission. UN￾HCR and CDC investigations of HEV 
outbreaks in refugee camps in south￾ern Sudan may provide data to answer 
these questions.
HEV is believed to have infected 
humans for centuries (9); however, the 
reemergence of the disease in refugee 
camps is a major concern because of 
the difficulty in implementing effec￾tive preventive measures under camp 
conditions. Point-of-care tests will be 
useful for rapidly detecting outbreaks 
and could potentially save lives. The 
progress made in developing effective 
vaccines is encouraging (10). Once 
available, HEV vaccination should be 
prioritized in this population, especial￾ly for pregnant women.

Wild Poliovirus 
Importation, 
Central African 
Republic1
To the Editor: Since the 
Global Polio Eradication Initiative 
was launched in 1988, indigenous 
transmission of wild poliovirus 
(WPV) has been interrupted in 
all countries except Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, and Nigeria (1). However, 
during 2003–2011, outbreaks resulting 
from importation of WPV occurred 
in 29 previously polio-free countries 
in Africa, including Central African 
Republic (CAR) (1–3). In 2011, 350 
WPV cases were reported from 12 
countries in Africa, a 47% decrease 
from the 657 cases reported by 12 
countries in Africa in 2010 (1). 
In CAR, the last case of 
poliomyelitis caused by indigenous 
transmission of wild poliovirus was 
reported in 2000, but importation of 
WPV type 1 has been reported (4). We 
describe the importation of WPV1 and 
WPV3 into CAR during successive 
events in 2008, 2009, and 2011.
To investigate importation of 
WPV into CAR, we conducted a 
study using fecal samples collected 
from patients in CAR who had acute 
flaccid paralysis (AFP) during 2008–
2011. The samples were analyzed for 
virus isolation, typing, and intratypic 
differentiation at the Regional 
Reference Laboratory for Polio, 
Institut Pasteur de Bangui, using 
World Health Organization (WHO) 
standard procedures (5). Isolated 
WPV strains were sent to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(Atlanta, Georgia, USA) or the 
National Institute for Communicable 
Diseases (Johannesburg, South 
Africa) for sequencing according to 
WHO guidelines (6–8). Cases were 
classified as laboratory confirmed or 
polio-compatible according to WHO 
recommendations; a polio-compatible 
case was defined as AFP for which 
stool samples were not adequate or a 
situation in which the patient was lost 
to follow up or had residual paralysis 
60 days after testing.
Of 141 AFP cases from 2008, 
three, from Bangui, Ouham, and Ouaka 
districts, were laboratory confirmed as 
WPV1; this cluster was designated 
B2D1B (Figure). Sequencing results 
showed that the virus in this cluster 
belonged to the South Asia A (Indian) 
genotype, which was circulating in 
Angola and Democratic Republic of 
Congo at that time (Figure). 
Of 163 AFP cases from 2009, 
14 in Ouham-Pende district were 
laboratory confirmed as WPV3; this 
cluster was designated D2B2B1. 
Sequencing results showed that the 
virus in this cluster belonged to 
West Africa B genotype, which was 
circulating in Nigeria and southern 
Chad at that time (Figure). 
Of 142 AFP cases from 2011, 
four in Ouham district were laboratory 
confirmed as WPV1; this cluster was 
designated I6C2B4C1A2. Sequencing 
results showed that the virus in this 
cluster belonged to West Africa 
B genotype, which was circulating 
in south Chad and Nigeria at the
time (Figure).
The importation of wild poliovirus 
strains into CAR appeared to follow 
3 different routes. In 2008, WPV1 
originated from Democratic Republic 
of Congo and was first detected in the 
capital, Bangui, which is located in
