Abstract
Objective Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a 
genetically complex, inflammatory bile duct disease 
of largely unknown aetiology often leading to liver 
transplantation or death. Little is known about the 
genetic contribution to the severity and progression 
of PSC. The aim of this study is to identify genetic 
variants associated with PSC disease progression and 
development of complications.
Design We collected standardised PSC subphenotypes 
in a large cohort of 3402 patients with PSC. After 
quality control, we combined 130 422 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms of all patients—obtained using the 
Illumina immunochip—with their disease subphenotypes. 
Using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards 
models, we identified genetic variants associated with 
binary and time-to-event PSC subphenotypes.
Results We identified genetic variant rs853974 
to be associated with liver transplant-free survival 
(p=6.07×10–9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed 
a 50.9% (95% CI 41.5% to 59.5%) transplant-free 
survival for homozygous AA allele carriers of rs853974 
compared with 72.8% (95% CI 69.6% to 75.7%) for 
GG carriers at 10 years after PSC diagnosis. For the 
candidate gene in the region, RSPO3, we demonstrated 
expression in key liver-resident effector cells, such as 
human and murine cholangiocytes and human hepatic 
stellate cells.
Conclusion We present a large international PSC
cohort, and report genetic loci associated with PSC
disease progression. For liver transplant-free survival, 
we identified a genome-wide significant signal and 
demonstrated expression of the candidate gene RSPO3
in key liver-resident effector cells. This warrants further 
assessments of the role of this potential key PSC modifier 
gene.
Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a complex, 
cholestatic liver disease, in which chronic biliary 
inflammation and bile duct destruction leads to 
biliary fibrosis and liver cirrhosis, often in a slowly 
progressive manner.1
 PSC is characterised by a 
cholangiographic image of strictures interchanged 
with dilatations throughout the biliary tract. 
Reported incidence rates of PSC vary widely, with 
incidence rates of 0.91, 1.31 and 0.5 per 100 000
inhabitants per year for North America, Norway

Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► Several case–control genome-wide association studies 
have revealed 20 susceptibility loci for primary sclerosing 
cholangitis.
► Little is known about the genetic contribution to the severity 
and progression of complex diseases in general and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis in particular.
► RSPO3 plays a role in the activation of the canonical Wnt 
signalling pathway, which is involved in liver fibrosis.
What are the new findings?
► The genetic variant rs853974 is genome-wide significantly 
associated with liver transplant-free survival in primary 
sclerosing cholangitis.
► Candidate gene RSPO3 is expressed in both murine and 
human cholangiocytes and in human hepatic stellate cells.
► Three new loci were found to be associated with time to 
cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing 
cholangitis.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
► Through its effect on liver fibrosis, RSPO3 could play an 
important role in PSC disease progression, and insight in its 
mechanism could lead to new therapeutic targets.
► Furthermore, since we demonstrated that genetic variants 
are associated with PSC disease progression, genetics could 
provide a tool for risk stratification of patients with PSC in 
the future.
and the Netherlands, respectively.2 3 There is a male to female 
ratio of 2:1, and the disease can occur at any age, with a 
peak incidence around 40 years.3
 There is a close association 
between PSC and IBD, and PSC patients are subject to a five￾fold increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC) 
when compared with the general population.3
 In addition, 
PSC carries an excess risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) which 
seems to be unrelated to the disease duration and the presence 
of liver cirrhosis.4
 There is no effective medical therapy that 
can halt disease progression in PSC. The only curative option 
to date is liver transplantation.
The aetiology of PSC is still largely unknown. The aetiology is 
most likely to be multifactorial, in which the occurrence of PSC 
could be triggered by environmental factors in a genetic suscep￾tible host.5
 The relationship between susceptibility to PSC and 
environmental factors has been studied for several risk factors, 
of which smoking has repeatedly been shown to be associated 
with a decreased risk of developing PSC, independent of its 
protective effect in UC.6
Already in 1983, the identification of associations between 
PSC and HLA-B8 of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) 
complex located on chromosome 6—harbouring several genes 
that are involved in antigen presentation and are important 
in immunity—raised interest in the role of genetics in PSC.7
This was amplified by a large Swedish study on PSC herita￾bility demonstrated a nearly 4 to 17 times increased risk for 
first-degree relatives of patients with PSC to develop PSC 
when compared with the general population.8
 The additional 
3.3 times increased risk of UC and the presence of at least one 
concomitant immune-mediated disease outside the liver and 
bowel in approximately 20% to 25% of patients with PSC 
suggests a shared genetic component between these diseases.8–10
Over the last 5years, the application of genome-wide associa￾tion studies has resulted in an increasing insight in the genetic 
architecture of PSC, with the identification of 19 non-HLA risk 
loci at the time of writing.11–14
Little is known about the genetic contribution to the severity 
and progression of complex diseases in general and PSC specif￾ically. In Mendelian traits like cystic fibrosis and haemochroma￾tosis, consortia efforts have led to the identification of robust 
and important modifier genes.15 16 If genetic variants would be 
associated with PSC phenotypes, this could enable risk stratifi￾cation of patients with PSC according to disease behaviour and 
would lead to insight into pathogenetic mechanisms associated 
to disease progression. While translational research from suscep￾tibility genes has yet to prove useful for the development of new 
drugs in complex disease, modifier genes may point towards 
pathways involved in disease progression amenable by pharma￾cological interventions.
The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants associated 
with PSC disease progression and development of complica￾tions, in a large, international, multicentre PSC cohort.
Methods
Study design and patients
Patients with PSC previously recruited throughout Europe, the 
USA and Canada and genotyped using the Immunochip by Liu 
et al13 were included. Subject recruitment was approved by the 
ethics committees or institutional review boards of all partici￾pating centres. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants. Patients of whom PSC diagnosis was revised after 
they were genotyped were excluded.
The following phenotypic data were collected for patient 
and disease characteristics: sex, date of birth, PSC subtype 
(small or large duct), date of PSC diagnosis, intrahepatic and/
or extrahepatic disease, dominant strictures, concomitant IBD 
and type of IBD, date of IBD diagnosis and smoking status. 
Furthermore, follow-up data were collected for date and 
cause of death, date and indication of liver transplantation, 
occurrence and date of diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), CCA, CRC, gallbladder carcinoma and occurrence 
and date of a colectomy.
PSC diagnosis was based on clinical, biochemical, cholangio￾graphic and histological criteria, as formulated by the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines.17 IBD diag￾nosis was scored based on accepted endoscopic, radiological and 
histological criteria.18
PSC-related death was defined as death from liver failure, 
death from cholangiosepsis, death from CCA or death from 
gallbladder carcinoma. The time-to-event phenotype liver trans￾plant-free survival was defined as the time between PSC diag￾nosis and the composite endpoint of either liver transplantation 
or PSC-related death.
We used genotype data of patients with PSC as previously 
described.13 Online supplementary appendix 1 describes the 
quality control applied to this dataset. A total of 130 422
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 3402 PSC samples 
remained after quality control and were used in the analysis.
Statistical analysis
The age at PSC diagnosis was expressed as median value and 
IQR. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and 
percentages based on non-missing values.

Binary associations
Binary associations were calculated using multiple logistic 
regression. We corrected for clinical covariates by adding them 
to the regression model. To determine which clinical covariates 
to correct for, we performed a backward elimination procedure 
per binary phenotype. We started with the full model including 
sex, country, date of PSC diagnosis, established IBD diagnosis 
and smoking status and removed covariates from the model until 
the Akaike information criterion stabilised.
Time-to-event associations
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the 
effect of genetic variants on time-to-event PSC subphenotypes. 
Clinical variables that were significantly associated with the 
time-to-event phenotype in univariable Cox regression analyses 
(p<0.05) were entered into a multivariable Cox model along￾side the genotype. To visualise the effect of genotype on time-to￾event phenotypes, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were plotted 
(see methods described in online supplementary appendix 1).
We used the SNP2HLA software19 to impute classical HLA 
alleles from genotype data for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, 
HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 and their 
corresponding amino acid polymorphisms from the genotype data 
(methods described in online supplementary appendix 1).
Mouse experiments and in vitro experiments on the role of 
RSPO3 in PSC
Mouse experiments
C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from Charles River (Milan, 
Italy). Normal C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed at the age of 
8–10weeks. Organs were harvested and washed by cold phos￾phate buffered saline. Cholangiocytes were isolated both from 
normal mice (n=3) and from mice (n=3) fed 0.1% 3,5-diethoxy￾carbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4weeks, as a model of 
sclerosing cholangitis.20 Total RNA was extracted and sequenced 
on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine (see online supplementary 
appendix 1 for more details).
In vitro experiments on human primary biliary tissue, cholangiocyte￾like cells and hepatic stellate cells
Human primary biliary tissue was obtained from a liver and 
pancreas organ donor after obtaining informed consent from 
the donor's family. A section of the bile duct was excised and 
homogenised and RNA was extracted. Cholangiocyte-like cells 
(CLCs) were generated from human induced pluripotent stem 
cells and cultured. RSPO3 expression was determined using 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) and compared with the housekeeping 
gene using the 2−ΔCt method.21 Next to that, we used previ￾ously published microarray data to verify RSPO3 expression.22
The R/Bioconductor package limma23 was used to evaluate 
differential expression between pairs of conditions (human-in￾duced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) and CLCs and hIPSCs 
and primary bile duct). A linear model fit was applied and 
p values were corrected using the method of Benjamini and 
Hochberg.24 Methods are further described in online supple￾mentary appendix 1.
Primary human hepatic stellate cells were isolated and cultured 
from wedge sections of liver tissue, obtained from patients 
undergoing surgery at the Royal Free Hospital in London. 
Total RNA was extracted and retrotranscribed into complemen￾tary DNA, which was used for gene expression assessment with 
qPCR. Gene expression was compared with the housekeeping 
gene using the 2−ΔCt method.
Results
Patient characteristics and natural history
Clinical characteristics of the PSC cohort are described in 
table 1. The cohort consisted of 2881 patients from Europe and 
521 patients from the USA and Canada (see online supplemen￾tary table 1). A total of 2185 (65%) patients were male, and the 
median age at PSC diagnosis was 38.6years (IQR 28.0–50.1). 
Concomitant IBD was diagnosed in 2390 (75%) patients. The 
median follow-up was 8.7years. In total, 874 (26%) patients 
underwent liver transplantation and 181 (5%) patients died of 
PSC-related causes. Over 11% of patients developed a malig￾nancy, most often CCA (5.6%) or CRC (4.3%).
Genetic associations with binary subphenotypes
Genome-wide association analyses focusing on the occurrence of 
malignancy in patients with PSC revealed several suggestive asso￾ciations (see online supplementary table 2). When comparing 107 
patients with PSC autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with 3159 patients 
with PSC but without AIH overlap, a strong genetic association 
in the HLA-DQB1 gene was identified (top SNP rs3891175, 
p=4.6×10–11, OR=2.41). After imputation of the classical HLA 
alleles, we found that the alleles DQA1*05:01 and DQB1*02:01 
were most significantly associated with PSC/AIH overlap (p values 
of 3.8×10–11 and 1.8×10–07). For other binary subphenotypes—
small duct PSC, the occurrence of HCC, gallbladder carcinoma 
and proctocolectomy—no genetic associations were found.
Genetic associations with time-to-event subphenotypes
Next, we aimed to determine whether genetic variants are asso￾ciated with important time-to-event variables reflecting the PSC 
disease course, for example, time between PSC diagnosis and the 
development of a carcinoma. For this, we developed a frame￾work to perform immunochip-wide Cox proportional hazards 
analyses. We defined the liver transplant-free survival subphe￾notype as time from PSC diagnosis until liver transplantation or 
PSC-related death.
Univariable Cox regression analyses including clinical param￾eters showed statistically significant associations with the time 
to event endpoint transplant-free survival for sex, country, date 
of PSC diagnosis, established IBD diagnosis and smoking status. 
Next, we tested 130 422 SNPs for association with liver trans￾plant-free survival using multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
regression, including the genotype effect alongside the significant 
clinical covariables. We found SNP rs853974 to be associated 
with liver transplant-free survival of patients with PSC at genome￾wide significance (p=6.07×10-9). Kaplan-Meier survival anal￾ysis showed a 50.9% (95% CI 41.5% to 59.5%) transplant-free 
survival for homozygous AA allele carriers of rs853974 compared 
with 72.8% (95% CI 69.6% to 75.7%) for GG carriers at 10 years 
after PSC diagnosis (figure 1A). AA homozygotes had a 2.14 (95% 
CI 1.66 to 2.76) increased hazard, indicating a 2.14 larger rela￾tive risk for need for liver transplantation or for PSC-related death 
compared with GG homozygotes. Figure 1B shows a regional plot 
of this observed association.
SNP rs853974 is located on chromosome 6. We did not identify 
a direct functional effect of this SNP on gene expression or regula￾tory features (see online supplementary appendix 1). We hypoth￾esised that neighbouring gene R-Spondin 3 (RSPO3) would be the 
most likely positional candidate gene. The other neighbouring 
gene, CENPW, has a fundamental role in kinetochore assembly 
and is required for normal chromosome organisation and progress 
through mitosis and thtaberefore not a good candidate. In addition 
to SNP rs853974, additional suggestive genetic associations with

Expression of RSPO3 in key liver-resident effector cells
To assess whether RSPO3 is expressed in disease-relevant 
cells (cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cells), we performed 
RNA sequencing on healthy and cholestatic cholangiocytes 
and multiple organs derived from normal C57BL/6 mice. 
RSPO3 expression was 7 to 20 folds higher in cholangiocytes 
as compared with any of the organs. Furthermore, RSPO3
expression was higher in healthy cholangiocytes than in choles￾tatic cholangiocytes (figure 2A).
Next, using microarrays, we assessed expression of RSPO3 in 
hIPSCs, hIPSC-derived CLCs, and human PBD samples. RSPO3
expression was significantly higher in CLCs and PBD cells 
compared with hIPSCs (figure 2B). This finding was confirmed 
by qPCR (figure 2C).
Since activated hepatic stellate cells are the main cells involved 
in liver fibrosis,25 we also investigated expression of RSPO3
in human culture-activated hepatic stellate cells. We isolated,

Discussion
To date, very few disease-modifying genes have been identified 
in rare complex diseases. Collaboration within the international 
PSC study group enabled the establishment of a cohort of 
unprecedented size, for an orphan disease such as PSC, enabling 
the investigation of genetic variation underlying the progres￾sion of PSC through time. Overall, it is a major challenge to 
determine genetic variants associated with survival, and only 
few genetic studies investigating this have been published.26 We 
present a conceptually new method to determine associations 
between genetic variants and disease course, using genome￾wide multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression anal￾yses. Here, we identify a genome-wide significant association 
between SNP rs853974 —located close to the RSPO3 gene—
and liver transplant-free survival in PSC. Interestingly, this locus 
is not associated with PSC susceptibility and thus exemplifies 
different genetic regulation of disease susceptibility and disease 
progression.
This study is based on genotype data obtained using Illumina 
immunochip, a genotyping platform that densely covers genetic 
regions associated to immune-mediated diseases. Use of genome￾wide association study (GWAS) arrays, that more uniformly cover 
genetic variants all over the genome, would have been ideal. 
However, a complete GWAS dataset for the entire international 
cohort was not available at the time of study. For that reason, we 
started with the available immunochip data. Given the positive 
findings in this study, a similar study on GWAS arrays data could 
very well be of additional value.
For the binary phenotype of developing CCA or not, we found 
an association at chromosome 5 at 150Mb (see online supple￾mentary table 2). Of interest, this locus contains an established 
genetic association with Crohn’s disease susceptibility in the 
autophagy gene IRGM.
27 For the phenotype of developing 
colorectal carcinoma or not, we found an association at chromo￾some 14 at 35Mb. This locus appeared not to be associated with 
sporadic colorectal cancer.
Since transplant-free survival is a combined and heteroge￾neous phenotype, we assessed to which extent the following 
three subgroups contribute to the association:
(1) transplanted patients with indication for transplanta￾tion ‘end stage liver disease’ and patients died because of ‘liver 
failure’; (2) transplanted patients with indication for trans￾plantation ‘cholangiocarcinoma (cca)/high-grade dysplasia’ and 
patients died because of ‘cca or gallbladder carcinoma’ and (3) 
transplanted patients with indication for transplantation ‘intol￾erable complaints/pruritus/recurrent cholangitis’ and patients 
died of ‘cholangiosepsis’. We observed a stronger contribution of 
subgroups 1 and 3 to the association, indicating that the under￾lying biological mechanism is more likely one involved in causing 
progression of liver disease and/or cholangitis or cholangiosepsis 
rather than a mechanism involved in cancer development.
RSPO3is a member of the R-Spondin protein family (R-Spondin 
1–4).28 These proteins are secreted agonists of the canonical Wnt/
beta (β)-catenin signalling pathway.28 They activate the pathway 
leading to induced transcription of Wnt target genes. Wnt/β-cat￾enin signalling plays a central role in embryogenesis, organogen￾esis and adult homeostasis and is a critical regulator of stem cell 
maintenance.29 30 RSPO3 is a ligand of the Frizzled 8 and LRP5/6 
receptors.28 In the canonical form of the Wnt pathway, binding 
of ligands to the Frizzled receptor and LRP5 or 6 coreceptors 
causes β-catenin to dephosphorylate in the cytoplasm. Accumu￾lated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds to T 
cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor, causing transcrip￾tion of Wnt target genes—such as Fibronectin, MMP-7, Twist
and Snail. These factors activate hepatic stellate cells and induce 
liver fibrosis. Blocking the Wnt signalling pathway using Dick￾kopf-1, a Wnt coreceptor antagonist, restores hepatic stellate

Figure 2 RSPO3 expression in mouse cholangiocytes and in human CLCs, PBD and HSCs.  (A) RNA sequencing analysis of RSPO3 expression in 
DDC-induced cholestatic cholangiocytes, healthy cholangiocytes and multiple organs of normal C57BL/6 mice. (B) Microarray RSPO3 expression in 
hiPSCs, CLCs and PBD. RSPO3 expression is significantly increased in CLCs and in PBD compared with hiPSCs. n=3; error bars, SD. Asterisks represent 
statistical significance (****adjusted p<0.0001, ***adjusted p<0.001, Benjamini and Hochberg corrected p values). (C) Quantitative real-time PCR 
analysis demonstrating the expression of RSPO3 in hiPSC-derived CLCs and PBD samples compared with expression in hiPSCs. Expression levels 
are fold changes compared with housekeeping gene HMDS calculated using the 2−ΔCt method. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showing 
expression of RSPO3 and cytoglobin B in three patients without PSC. Cytoglobin B messenger RNA expression was evaluated as specific HSC marker. 
Target genes were normalised using GAPDH as endogenous control and their relative expression was calculated with the 2−ΔCt method. CLCs,

cells quiescence in culture.31 Hence, Wnt signalling is involved 
in both progression and regression of liver fibrosis, either by 
inhibiting or promoting activation and survival of hepatic stel￾late cells.31 32 Also, RSPOs have been shown to facilitate hepatic 
stellate cell activation and promote hepatic fibrogenesis.33 Here, 
we demonstrate that RSPO3 is expressed in key effector cells 
involved in the pathogenesis of PSC. Since we have shown that 
patients with PSC that are homozygote AA carriers of rs853974 
progress more rapidly towards PSC-related death or liver trans￾plantation, RSPO3 can be regarded a plausible candidate gene to 
be involved in PSC disease progression. Hypothetically, patients 
with PSC might benefit from reduction of RSPO3 or generally 
canonical Wnt signalling.
In an immunochip analysis of the International IBD Genetics 
Consortium including over 75000 individuals,34 an intronic 
SNP rs9491697 in RSPO3 (which is not in linkage disequilib￾rium with rs853974, r2
=0.014) was identified to be associated 
with Crohn’s disease (p=3.79×10–10, OR=1.077) but not with 
UC. Given the small number of patients with Crohn’s disease 
(n=357) within the present study, the lack of linkage disequi￾librium between the two ‘hit SNPs’ and the fact that our multi￾variate Cox model corrected for IBD-status, the identified 
association signal does not seem to be driven by the co-occur￾rence of Crohn’s disease in our cohort.
For several binary and time-to-event subphenotypes, we 
found suggestive genetic associations. Two additional SNPs, 
rs1532244 on chromosome 3 and rs17649817 on chromosome 
5, were suggestively associated with transplant-free survival. 
Furthermore, one SNP, rs7731017, was suggestively associated 
with the presence of CCA. We investigated whether any of the 
candidate genes in the locus overlapped with genes identified in 
tumour sequencing studies of CCA. We did not find an overlap 
with the 32 genes reported to be significantly altered in intrahe￾patic, extrahepatic and gallbladder cancer by Nakamura et al.
35
When comparing the genes in our CCA locus with 1146 genes 
containing non-synonymous somatic mutations in intrahepatic 
CCA,36 we found that the SYNPO gene was both in the list of 
1146 genes of the sequencing study as well as in the locus that 
we identified to be associated with the presence of CCA. There 
is little known about this gene and there is no connection with 
oncogenesis. Another gene, SP100, was found in this study to be 
in the locus associated with time to CCA and is also in the list 
of 1146 genes. SP100 is associated with autoimmune disease of 
the urogenital tract and also with PBC. Interestingly, anti-sp100

autoantibodies have been described for PBC.37 The genetic asso￾ciation of SP100 with both PBC and the time to CCA within 
patients with PSC as well as the existence of anti-sp100 auto￾antibodies makes this an interesting gene for future follow-up 
studies.
When comparing patients with PSC-AIH with patients with 
PSC but without AIH, we found a strong genetic association 
with PSC-AIH in the HLA-DQB1 gene. The identified variant 
was tagging the classical HLA haplotypes DQA1*05:01 and 
DQB1*02:01. These associations overlap the associations found 
by a previous genome-wide association study of AIH type 1 in 
the Netherlands,38 suggesting that the genetic basis for AIH type 
1 pathogenesis is similar for patients with isolated AIH type 1 
compared with patients with PSC-AIH.
This study is limited by the relatively small cohort size when 
compared with other GWAS studies that incorporate tens of 
thousands of samples. The resulting lack of statistical power may 
have played a role in the binary analyses, in which suggestive 
hits were found for CCA and CRC but genome-wide significance 
was not reached. However, PSC is a rare disease, and the present 
study has included patients recruited throughout the world in a 
joined effort. It is therefore not expected that a larger cohort of 
PSC cases will become available soon.
In conclusion, we present the largest association study of PSC 
genotypes with disease phenotypes to date. We identified several 
genetic variants associated with PSC disease course. Specifically, 
we report rs853974 to be genome-wide significantly associated 
with liver transplant-free survival in PSC. Findings of candidate 
gene RSPO3 being expressed in both mouse and human chol￾angiocytes and human-activated hepatic stellate cells warrant 
further assessments of the role of this potential key PSC modi￾fier gene.
