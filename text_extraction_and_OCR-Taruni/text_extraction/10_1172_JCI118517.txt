Abstract
Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD-IV) is an autosomal
recessive disease resulting from deficient glycogen-branch￾ing enzyme (GBE) activity. The classic and most common
form is progressive liver cirrhosis and failure leading to ei￾ther liver transplantation or death by 5 yr of age. However,
the liver disease is not always progressive. In addition, a
neuromuscular type of the disease has been reported. The
molecular basis of GSD-IV is not known, nor is there a
known reason for the clinical variability. We studied the
GBE gene in patients with various presentations of GSD￾IV. Three point mutations in the GBE gene were found in
two patients with the classical presentation: R515C, F257L,
and R524X. Transient expression experiments showed that
these mutations inactivated GBE activity. Two point muta￾tions, L224P and Y329S, were detected in two separate al￾leles of a patient with the nonprogressive hepatic form. The
L224P resulted in complete loss of GBE activity, whereas
the Y329S resulted in loss of z 50% of GBE activity. The
Y329S allele was also detected in another patient with the
nonprogressive form of GSD-IV but not in 35 unrelated
controls or in patients with the more severe forms of GSD￾IV. A 210-bp deletion from nucleotide 873 to 1082 of the
GBE cDNA was detected in a patient with the fatal neona￾tal neuromuscular presentation. This deletion, representing
the loss of one full exon, was caused by a 39 acceptor splic￾ing site mutation (ag to aa). The deletion abolished GBE ac￾tivity. Our studies indicate that the three different forms of
GSD-IV were caused by mutations in the same GBE gene.
The data also suggest that the significant retention of GBE
activity in the Y329S allele may be a reason for the mild dis￾ease. Further study of genotype/phenotype correlations may
yield useful information in predicting the clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD-IV)1
 is an autosomal
recessive disease caused by deficient glycogen-branching en￾zyme (GBE) activity. The disease is also referred to as amy￾lopectinosis, because the abnormally stored glycogen has
fewer branch points, more a1-4 linked glucose units, and
longer outer chains, resulting in a structure resembling amy￾lopectin (1–3). Clinically, GSD-IV is a heterogeneous disorder
with remarkable clinical variability. The most common and
classical form of GSD-IV is progressive liver cirrhosis, which
typically presents in the first 18 mo of life with hepatospleno￾megaly and failure to thrive. This is followed by progressive
liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension, ascites, esophageal va￾rices, and liver failure, leading to death by 5 yr of age. There
are, though less frequently, patients with liver dysfunction who
have survived without evidence of progressive liver disease (4–
7). In addition to the hepatic form, a neuromuscular form of
the disease has been reported. These patients may (a) present
at birth with severe hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and neuronal
involvement with death in the neonatal period (8–11); (b)
present in late childhood with myopathy or cardiopathy (12–
14); or (c) present as adults with diffuse central and peripheral
nervous system dysfunction accompanied by accumulation of
polyglucosan bodies in the nervous system (so-called adult
polyglucosan body disease) (15, 16).
The molecular basis of GSD-IV is not known, nor is there a
known reason for this remarkable clinical variability. All cur￾rent methods for determination of GBE activity are indirect
and therefore not suitable for quantitative analysis of GBE re￾sidual activity, and they cannot differentiate the various forms
of the disease (7, 8, 17). At the present time, it is difficult to
predict the patient’s prognosis after initial diagnosis. It is
hoped that the molecular characterization of the different clin￾ical presentations of GSD-IV may yield information that
would be helpful in predicting the clinical outcomes, allowing
better counseling and treatment.
A human GBE cDNA has been cloned (18). The full
length of the cDNA is z 3 kb. The coding sequence contains
2,106 bp encoding a 702–amino acid protein. The calculated
molecular mass of the GBE protein, derived from its cDNA
sequence, is 80,438 D. The human GBE gene has been shown
to be located on chromosome 3 (18). The availability of the
GBE cDNA will allow study of the disease at the molecular
level and unraveling of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the clinical variability.
In this paper, we studied the GBE gene in GSD-IV pa￾tients with three distinct presentations: the classic presentation
of progressive liver cirrhosis and failure; liver disease without

apparent progression; and the fatal neonatal neuromuscular
presentation. We report mutations in the GBE gene in these
patients. 
Methods
Patients. Only patients with an enzymatically confirmed diagnosis of
GSD-IV were included in this study. All patients were identified
through our diagnostic facility for study of glycogen storage disease,
except one in whom skin fibroblasts were obtained from National In￾stitute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Re￾pository (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ; GM
00572). Mutations were studied in detail in four patients with the fol￾lowing clinical histories.
Patient 1 was a neonate who presented at birth with profound hy￾potonia, muscle atrophy, and dilated cardiomyopathy, and died at 4
wk of age from respiratory and cardiac failure. The clinical and
pathologic findings of this infant have been reported (8). This patient
represents the neonatal fatal neuromuscular form of the disease.
Patient 2 is a 3 8/12-yr-old Jewish female who presented at 12 mo
of age with failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and elevation of serum
liver transaminases (7). The liver biopsy showed large accumulations
of fibrillar periodic acid Schiff-positive material in the hepatocytes,
which was partially resistant to diastase digestion. Portal areas ap￾peared broadened with advanced fibrosis. The liver enzymes peaked
at the age of 18 mo, and then gradually declined and returned to nor￾mal by 29 mo of age. During the past 15 mo, her liver function contin￾ued to be normal, and there was no clinical evidence of muscle, car￾diac, or neurological involvement. This patient represents the
nonprogressive hepatic form of the disease.
Patients 3 and 4 presented in early infancy with progressive liver
cirrhosis and failure. Patient 4 underwent liver transplantation, and
patient 3 died of liver failure before 4 yr of age. These two patients
represent the classic hepatic form of the disease.
Total cellular RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was extracted
from cultured skin fibroblasts using acid guanidinium-phenol-chloro￾form method (19).
Northern blot analysis. Total RNA (10–20 mg) was fractionated
on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane,
and hybridized to DNA probes, radiolabeled with a-[32P]dCTP using
Megaprime kit (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL).
Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and subcloning. First-strand cDNAs
were synthesized using a gene-specific primer (59-CTGCATCTG￾GTGGAGCTGAAATCAG-39 [BE2230(2)], nucleotides 2230–2206
of the published human branching enzyme cDNA sequence), and Su￾perscript RT (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). The second-strand
cDNA and additional PCR reactions were carried out using Vent
DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and a
pair of primers that covered the entire coding region of the human GBE
gene (nucleotides 88–105, 59-TTTGGGGGTACCAATATGGCG￾GCTCCGAT-39 sense [BE88(1)] and 2205–2186, 59-TTGGGGGAA￾TTCGCCTCTTCAATTCGGCAGAT-39 antisense [BE2205(2)]). The
sense and antisense primers contained additional KpnI and EcoRI
linkers, respectively, and, after digestion with KpnI and EcoRI, the
amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into the mammalian ex￾pression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). 
DNA sequencing. Double-stranded dideoxy-chain termination
method (20) was performed using [35S]dATP and Sequenase 2.0
DNA-sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland,
OH) with T7, SP6, or GBE gene-specific primers. Double-stranded
DNA cycle sequencing (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) was also
used for direct sequencing of PCR products.
Screening of genomic DNA library. A genomic DNA library con￾structed in l-GEM 11 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was screened
by the GBE cDNA probe (21). The probe was labeled with
a-[32P]dCTP by the random primer method using the Megaprime kit
(Amersham Corp.). The positive clones were partially sequenced by
using the cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.).
Determination of exon–intron boundary sequences. The exon–intron
boundary sequences containing suspected mutations were deter￾mined by PCR with the end trimming and cassette ligation method
(22). The oligonucleotides used in this procedure are listed in Table I.
Briefly, human genomic DNA was digested with three groups of re￾striction endonucleases: group 1, BamHI, BglII, BstYI, and Sau3AI;
group 2, AvrII, NheI, SpeI, and XbaI; group 3, SalI and XhoI. The di￾gests were then ligated with cassettes MC oligo 1AC1, MC oligo
1AC2, and MC oligo 1AC3 (Table I) followed by the initial PCRs
using MC outer and BE1060(2), or BE950(1) (Table I). These PCR
products were further amplified with nested primers MC inner and
BE930(2) or BE1020(1) (Table I). The PCR products were then
subcloned into a TA-cloning vector PCR II using TA cloning kit (In￾vitrogen Corp.). The boundary sequence was determined by the dou￾ble-stranded dideoxy-chain termination method using Sequenase 2.0.
Verification of mutations in the genomic DNA. To detect the splic￾ing site mutation in patient 1, genomic DNA was amplified with in￾tronic primers (oligonucleotides 1 and 2, Table II), and the PCR
products were sequenced directly by the cycle sequencing method. To
confirm further the splicing site mutation, the genomic DNA was am￾plified with another pair of primers (oligonucleotides 3 and 4, Table
II). The resulting PCR products were digested with HincII and elec￾trophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (23). To detect mutations
R515C and R524X, genomic DNA was amplified with primers (oligo￾nucleotides 5 and 6, Table II), and the PCR products were digested
with Sau3AI or TaqI, respectively. To confirm mutation F257L, ge￾nomic DNA was amplified with primers (oligonucleotides 7 and 8,
Table II), and the PCR products were digested with DdeI. To detect
L224P and A214T, genomic DNA was amplified with a pair of mis￾matched primers (oligonucleotides 9 and 10, Table II), and the PCR
products were digested with BslI or AluI, respectively. To detect

Construction of GBE mutant cDNAs. To construct the GBE cDNA
containing either A214T or L224P, site-directed mutagenesis was per￾formed. The entire coding region of wild-type human brancher
cDNA and the cDNA clone that contained both A214T and L224P
were used as the templates. The two outside primers were BE88(1)
and BE2205(2), which were described above. The two inside primers
were BE773(2) 59-TTGATcCTaGGTAGTACATTGC-39 antisense,
which contained two basepair mismatches at nucleotide 765 and 768
to create a restriction enzyme site AvrII, and BE757(1) 59-
GTACTACCtAGgATCAAAGGCC-39 sense, which contained two
basepair mismatches at nucleotide 765 and 768 to create the same re￾striction site. These two basepair changes made two silent mutations,
which did not alter the coding amino acids. Another inside primer
that contained the mutation L224P and the two silent mutations was
BE773(2) mutant 59-TTGATcCTaGGTgGTACATTGC-39 anti￾sense. The mismatched and mutant bases are indicated by lowercase
letters. PCRs with two pairs of primers, BE88(1) and BE773(2),
BE757(1) and BE2205(2), were performed on both the wild-type
and the cDNA clone which contained A214T and L224P, to create
the wild-type with the silent mutations and the A214T with the silent
mutations. PCRs with two pairs of primers, BE88(1) and BE773(2)
mutant, BE757(1) and BE2205(2), were performed on the wild-type
cDNA clone to create the L224P with the silent mutations. The PCR
products were digested with KpnI, AvrII, and EcoRI and then ligated
into pcDNA3 vector. All constructs were confirmed by DNA se￾quencing. Other mutant clones containing either R515C, F257L,
R524X, or Y329S were obtained directly from the original RT-PCR
products. 
Transient transfection in COS-7 cells. To confirm the mutations
causing GSD-IV, transient expression experiments were performed
in COS-7 cells. The wild-type or mutant cDNA in a pcDNA3 vector
(Invitrogen Corp.) was transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE￾dextran method (24). Mock transfections of COS-7 cultures with
pcDNA3 vector were used as controls. After incubation at 378C for
24 h, the transfected cultures were subcultured (1:2 split) and incu￾bated for an additional 24 h. One culture was harvested for branching
enzyme assays, and in some cases the other culture was used for RNA
isolation. For each cDNA clone, four transfection experiments were
performed, and the results were expressed as mean and range of four
separate determinations.
Enzyme assay for branching enzyme activity. Branching enzyme
activity was determined using phosphorylase as the indicating en￾zyme (3, 6).
Results
Northern blot analysis of GBE in patients and normal controls
The branching enzyme mRNA in normal control is z 3 kb
(Fig. 1, lane 1). The neonate with fatal neuromuscular presen￾tation of GSD-IV demonstrated a smaller size and reduced
amount of GBE mRNA (lane 2). Three patients who pre￾sented with progressive liver cirrhosis and failure, followed by
either liver transplantation or death in early childhood, were
shown to have either a reduced amount (lanes 4 and 5) or a
trace amount (lane 3) of brancher mRNA. Two other patients
(lanes 6 and 7) who presented with liver disease but no pro￾gression had normal amounts and sizes of brancher mRNA.
No striking difference in the g-actin mRNA levels was ob￾served among these samples. Southern blot analysis of ge￾nomic DNA digested with EcoRI, HindIII, or MspI did not
detect gross DNA rearrangements, deletions, or insertions in
the GBE gene of these patients (data not shown).

Identification and characterization of mutations 
A 39 acceptor splicing site mutation was present in a patient with
neonatal fatal neuromuscular form of the GSD-IV. A 210-bp de￾letion from nucleotide 873 to 1082 was detected in all 10
cDNA clones obtained from subcloning of the RT-PCR prod￾ucts from patient 1 (Fig. 2 A), consistent with the smaller size
of brancher mRNA in the Northern blot (Fig. 1, lane 2). This
deletion resulted in a loss of 70 amino acids from the GBE
polypeptide (262–331). The deletion did not shift the reading
frame and did not change any of the remaining amino acid se￾quence. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using the 210-
bp region that was absent from mRNA as a probe showed a
normal pattern (data not shown). The 210 bp, therefore, were
deleted during RNA processing, most likely because of a splic￾ing junction mutation. Using PCR with end trimming and cas￾sette ligation method (22), the 210 bp were shown to be a sin￾gle exon. The 59 and 39 boundary sequences of this exon were
determined and used as primers (Table II, oligo 1 and 2) for
PCR. Direct cycle sequencing of the PCR products showed a
39acceptor splicing site mutation changing ag to aa. The muta￾tion created a new restriction enzyme site for HincII that was
not present in the normal allele. PCR amplification of genomic
DNA showed an 84-bp fragment in normal control. After
HincII digestion, the 84-bp fragment remained intact in nor￾mal control. However, a 60-bp and a 24-bp fragment were ob￾served in patient 1 (Fig. 2 C). The result is consistent with
homozygosity or heterozygosity with failure of the other chro￾mosome to amplify in the PCR analysis. The completely abol￾ished branching enzyme activity by this deletion was demon￾strated by the transient transfection experiments in COS-7
cells (Table III).
Point mutations were detected in a patient with nonprogres￾sive hepatic form of GSD-IV. 13 cDNA clones were sequenced
from patient 2 (Fig. 1, lane 6), who had a nonprogressive he￾patic form of the disease. A G-to-A transition at nucleotide
730 and a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 761 (Fig. 3 A) were
detected in four clones. The other eight clones contained an
A-to-C transversion at nucleotide 1076 (Fig. 3 B). The G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 730 caused an Ala214-to-Thr substitu￾tion (A214T) and the T-to-C transition at 761 caused a Leu224
 -
to-Pro substitution (L224P). The A1076-to-C transversion
caused a Tyr329-to-Ser substitution (Y329S).
To ensure that the point mutations detected in cDNA
clones were not PCR artifacts, genomic DNA was studied. We
first determined the exon–intron boundary sequences around
these mutations and used this information to design primers
for PCR. The A214T and L224P were located in a single exon,
and Y329S was 4 bp away from the 39 border of another exon.
By restriction analysis of PCR-amplified genomic products,
these mutations were confirmed. Family study showed that the
proband inherited L224P from her father, and neither her
mother nor two unaffected siblings had the allele (Fig. 3 C).
The A214T allele also followed the same inheritance pattern Figure 2. Mutation study in patient 1. (A) A 210-bp deletion from

as L224P (data not shown), indicating that these two alleles are
on the same chromosome, consistent with the cDNA data. The
proband’s other allele, Y329S, was inherited from her mother,
and one of the two unaffected siblings also had the mutant al￾lele, suggesting carrier status (Fig. 3 D). 
Transient transfection experiments were performed to de￾termine which mutations resulted in disease phenotype. Since
A214T and L224P appeared on the same chromosome, site￾directed mutagenesis was performed to separate these two
mutations into two cDNA clones that contained either A214T
or L224P. To make GBE cDNA containing either A214T or
L224P, a restriction enzyme site (AvrII) was created by intro￾ducing two silent mutations (A765 to T and A768 to G) for the
purpose of ligation and subcloning. Transfection of cDNA
containing the L224P allele resulted in markedly reduced
GBE activity compared with experiments with wild-type
cDNA and wild-type cDNA with silent mutations (Table III).
The cDNA containing A214T allele, in contrast, had normal
GBE activity (Table III). This indicated that the L224P muta￾tion, but not A214T, is the disease-causing mutation. The
Y329S allele, however, had z 50% of GBE activity compared
with the wild type (Table III). Northern blot analysis of
branching enzyme transcripts from transfected COS-7 cells
showed that the wild-type and mutant brancher mRNAs were
expressed at similar levels (data not shown), indicating that the
degree of reduction of branching enzyme activity among the
mutant alleles compared with the wild-type allele was unlikely
to have been caused by differences in the efficiency of trans￾fection and/or transcription.
Y329S was detected only in patients with nonprogressive he￾patic form of GSD-IV. To test whether Y329S represents a
common polymorphism, we screened 35 unrelated control in￾dividuals. The Y329S mutation was not present in any of these
control individuals. We also screened for the Y329S mutation
in 11 additional GSD-IV patients (6 with progressive liver cir￾rhosis and failure, 2 with fatal neonatal neuromuscular presen￾tation, and 3 with the nonprogressive hepatic form). The
Y329S mutation was not detected in any of the more severe
forms of GSD-IV (Fig. 3 E). The Y329S allele was, however,
detected in another GSD-IV patient who had liver disease
without progression (Fig. 3 E). This patient is currently 20 yr
old and has normal liver function (7).

Partial sequencing of cDNA clones. The 
GBE gene of patient 2 contained a G-to-A 
transition at nucleotide 730 and a T-to-C 
transition at nucleotide 761, which caused 
an Ala214-to-Thr substitution (A214T) and 
Leu224-to-Pro substitution (L224P), re￾spectively. (B) Partial sequencing data of

Point mutations detected in patients with classical presenta￾tion of GSD-IV. Three point mutations were found in patients
3 and 4, who had the classical clinical presentation of progres￾sive liver cirrhosis and failure. A point mutation that involved
a C-to-T transition at cDNA sequence 1633 that changed
Arg515 to Cys (R515C) was detected in 19 of 20 cDNA clones
from patient 3. This mutation was also detected by direct se￾quencing of the RT-PCR product (a single band as shown in
Fig. 4 A). The mutation caused a loss of the restriction enzyme
site Sau3AI. Using a pair of primers (Table II, oligonucle￾otides 5 and 6), genomic DNA was amplified and digested with
Sau3AI. An 88-bp fragment amplified from patient 3 was di￾gested into three bands of 88, 50, and 38 bp (Fig. 4 B). This
suggested that patient 3 was a compound heterozygote with
another allele, presumably mRNA negative (decreased tran￾scription or unstable mRNA), consistent with the decreased
amount of GBE mRNA in the Northern blot (Fig. 1, lane 4).
In patient 4, nine cDNA clones obtained by subcloning of
the RT-PCR products were sequenced. Seven clones carried a
T-to-A transversion at cDNA position 861 that changed Phe257
to Leu (F257L) (Fig. 5 A), and two clones contained a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1660 that altered Arg524 to a stop
codon (R524X) (Fig. 5 B). To confirm the mutation in the pa￾tient’s genomic DNA, the exon–intron junction sequence was
determined by direct sequencing of the genomic clones con￾taining the mutation. Since F257L is close to the 39 end of an
exon, the genomic DNA was amplified with two primers: The
sense strand primer was generated from the exon and the anti￾sense strand primer from the intron (Table II, oligonucleotides
7 and 8). A 78-bp fragment was amplified. The mutation cre￾ated a new DdeI site. The restriction pattern of the digest
showing three fragments suggested that patient 4 is heterozy￾gous for the F257L mutation (Fig. 5 C). For mutation R524X,
an 88-bp fragment was amplified from genomic DNA using

primers 5 and 6 (Table II). The mutation eliminated a TaqI
site. The restriction pattern of the digest (three bands at 88, 67,
and 21 bp) confirmed that the other allele of patient 4 carried
the mutation R524X (Fig. 5 D).
None of the three point mutations in patients 3 and 4 were
present in normal controls or eight other GSD-IV patients
studied. These mutations inactivated the GBE activities to var￾ious levels, ranging from 80 to 99% (Table III).
Other sequence variations. A deviation of the published
GBE cDNA sequences (18) was observed at nucleotide 353 in￾volving a C-to-G change. This nucleotide difference, which al￾tered amino acid 88 from serine to cysteine, was detected in all
cDNA clones from controls and patients. We believe this rep￾resents the correct sequence and that the sequence in early re￾ports represents either a rare variant or an artifact. An A-to-G
transition at nucleotide 658 that altered Arg190 to Gly was ob￾served both in controls and in patients, with 67 and 33% fre￾quencies of A and G alleles, respectively. This nucleotide
change appeared to be a polymorphism as frequencies of the
two alleles in GSD-IV patients were not different from that in
the controls.
Discussion
Although progressive liver cirrhosis is the classic and most
common clinical presentation for GSD-IV, a review of the lit￾erature (1–16) and the patients presented here demonstrate
significant clinical variability. Enzymatically, except for adult
polyglucosan body disease (15, 16), most GSD-IV patients
have what appears to be a generalized enzyme defect. The de￾ficiency of GBE activity and the accumulation of amylopectin
can be demonstrated in almost all tissues studied, including
liver, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, leukocytes, and fibroblasts
(5, 9, 12). The differing degree of clinical severity and organ in￾volvement is unlikely to be due to defects in tissue-specific
isoenzymes encoded by different genes expressed in different
tissues, since there is no clear evidence for the existence of iso￾forms of the branching enzyme (25, 26). Based on these data,
we hypothesized that the various forms of GSD-IV are en￾coded by mutations in the same GBE structural gene. GSD-IV
patients studied in this work represented three very different
clinical presentations: neonates with a fatal neuromuscular dis￾order without liver fibrosis, patients with progressive liver cir￾rhosis and failure, and patients with liver disease but without
apparent progression. Despite the remarkable clinical variabil￾ity, we have identified molecular defects in the same GBE
gene, albeit different mutations, in these three different forms
of GSD-IV. Thus, these various forms of GSD-IV represented
an allelic heterogeneity of the GBE gene.
When an infant presenting with liver cirrhosis is diagnosed
as GSD-IV, the decision for liver transplantation is compli￾cated by the difficulty in predicting how the disease will
progress: either liver failure and death, or a benign course (4–7).
Our finding of a significant residual GBE activity (50% con￾trol) in the mutant Y329S allele may have clinical implications.
This mutant allele was found in two out of four nonprogressive
hepatic GSD-IV patients, but in none of the more severe
GSD-IV patients (two with the fatal neonatal neuromuscular
presentation and six with the progressive liver cirrhosis and
failure). The Y328S allele also was not present in any of the 35
unrelated control individuals. The presence of significant GBE
activity in the Y329S allele might be a reason why patients with
the mild hepatic form of the disease are protected from pro￾gression to liver failure.
It is interesting to note that, except for the deletion, none
of the missense mutations involved proposed catalytically ac￾tive sites of the GBE. The 210-bp deletion caused by the
39acceptor splicing site mutation in patient 1 is located in a re￾gion that is highly conserved between prokaryotic, yeast, and
human branching enzyme polypeptide sequences (27), and
also includes the first of the four regions (DVVHS) that consti￾tute the catalytically active sites of most amylolytic enzymes
(27, 28). The deletion completely abolished GBE activity in
transient expression experiments. The missense mutations
identified in this study also diminished the GBE activity; how￾ever, how these point mutations affect the GBE activity is not
clear. This will await structure–function analysis of the mutant
proteins.
We conclude that the three distinct forms of GSD-IV all re￾sult from mutations in the same GBE gene. Further study of
genotype/phenotype correlation may yield information useful
in predicting the clinical outcomes.
