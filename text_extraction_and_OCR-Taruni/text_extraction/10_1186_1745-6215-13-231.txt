Abstract
Background: Using reduced doses of Cyclosporine A immediately after heart transplantation in clinical trials may
suggest benefits for renal function by reducing serum creatinine levels without a significant change in clinical
endpoints. However, these trials were not sufficiently powered to prove clinical outcomes.
Methods: In a prospective, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial, 95 patients aged 18 to 65 years
old, undergoing de novo heart transplantation were centrally randomised to receive either a low (130 < trough CsA
concentrations <200 μg/L, n = 47) or a standard dose of Cyclosporine A (200 < trough CsA concentrations
<300 μg/L, n = 48) for the three first post-transplant months along with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.
Participants had a stable haemodynamic status, a serum creatinine level <250 μmol/L and the donors’ cold
ischemia time was under six hours; multiorgan transplants were excluded. The change in serum creatinine level
over 12 months was used as the main criterion for renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed on the
95 randomised patients and a mixed generalised linear model of covariance was applied.
Results: At 12 months, the mean (± SD) creatinine value was 120.7 μmol/L (± 35.8) in the low-dose group and
132.3 μmol/L (± 49.1) in the standard-dose group (P = 0.162). Post hoc analyses suggested that patients with higher
creatinine levels at baseline benefited significantly from the lower Cyclosporine A target. The number of patients
with at least one rejection episode was not significantly different but one patient in the low-dose group and six in
the standard-dose group required dialysis.
Conclusions: In patients with de novo cardiac transplantation, early Cyclosporine A dose reduction was not
associated with renal benefit at 12 months. However, the strategy may benefit patients with high creatinine levels
before transplantation.

Background
Cyclosporine A (CsA, calcineurin inhibitor) consider￾ably improves survival after heart transplantation, lead￾ing to its widespread use over the last 25 years [1,2].
The last registry report of the International Society for
Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) provides overall
survival rates of 80, 70, and 55% after one, five, and ten
years, respectively [3].
This long-term survival is impaired by CsA side
effects; in particular, nephrotoxicity that frequently leads
to renal impairment. Retrospective studies have shown a
5 to 10% risk of chronic renal failure in patients treated
with CsA after heart transplantation [2,4-6]. After trans￾plantation of a non-renal organ, patients have a five-year
risk of chronic renal failure from 7 to 21%, depending
on what kind of organ is transplanted [5].
To limit renal impairment, several approaches have
been explored in renal, cardiac, and liver transplantation.
Immunosuppressive regimens have used mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF) in combination with a calcineurin inhibi￾tor (CNI) [7]. These efficient strategies foster the use of
reduced CNI doses after the first high-risk rejection
period after transplantation. In long-term heart trans￾plant recipients with chronic renal dysfunction, a signifi￾cant improvement in renal function and metabolic
profile with no increased risk of acute rejection episodes
was observed [8,9].
The use of reduced CsA doses immediately after renal
transplantation has already been assessed in clinical
trials [10-14]. Results suggest a benefit on renal function
with a reduction in serum creatinine levels without a sig￾nificant change in clinical endpoints (biopsy-proven re￾jection episodes, death). However, these trials were not
sufficiently powered to prove clinical outcomes, but each
of them adds a piece of the puzzle and should be avail￾able through publication in order to reduce the risk of
bias when carrying out a systematic review.
Therefore, the reduction of CsA nephrotoxic effects
using low doses immediately after heart transplantation,
although attractive, has not been formally evaluated yet.
The present study investigated the effect of an early low
dose of CsA plus MMF on the change in serum creati￾nine level over a year in de novo heart transplant
recipients.
Methods
Study design and ethics
This is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, rando￾mised, parallel-group study. It was investigator designed.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon, France), declared to the
French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFS￾SAPS), registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under number
NCT00159159, and conducted in accordance with the
European Guidance for Good Clinical Practice and the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Randomisation and treatment
Within four days post-surgery, patients undergoing de
novo heart transplantation were randomised to receive
either a low dose or a standard dose of CsA, in a 1/1
ratio, as part of a triple immunosuppressant regimen, in￾cluding MMF, and corticosteroids.
Patients were randomised using a centralised proce￾dure. Randomisation was stratified by centre, age, pre￾sence of ischemia, and serum creatinine level before
transplantation. Patients were followed up for 12 months.
During the first three months, the low-dose group
received CsA targeting a whole blood pre-dose concen￾tration (C0) of 130 to 200 μmol/L, whereas the standard￾dose group received CsA with a C0 between 200 and
300 μmol/L. Both doses reflect current practice [15].
Thereafter, to follow standard practice, the CsA doses of
the standard-dose group were tapered to match the C0
of the low-dose group (130 μmol/L to 200 μmol/L).
The immunosuppressive treatment also included
MMF (3 g daily) and corticosteroids according to local
practice. MMF doses were adjusted according to indivi￾dual tolerance.
All other concomitant antibacterial, antifungal, anti￾viral, anticholesterol, or antihypertensive drugs were
administered at the discretion of physicians.
Patients
Overall, 95 patients were enrolled in 10 French heart
transplantation centres. Male and female heart trans￾plant patients, aged 18 to 65, undergoing de novo heart
transplantation were eligible. Donors’ cold ischemia time
was under six hours. The main recipient exclusion cri￾teria were: unstable haemodynamic status at the time of
randomisation, circulatory assistance, serum creatinine
level >250 μmol/L, multiorgan transplant, history of ma￾lignant disease within the past five years, a human
immunodeficiency virus-positive blood test, a positive
HB-antigen test, or a positive PCR hepatitis C test. Preg￾nant or breastfeeding women, patients participating in
another trial, drug addicts, and psychiatric patients were
also excluded. Each participant gave written informed
consent.
Study objectives, primary and secondary endpoints
The primary objective was to compare the renal function
between the two groups by assessing changes in serum
creatinine levels from inclusion up to 12 months. Crea￾tinine clearance, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria were
used as secondary endpoints. Immunosuppressive effi￾cacy endpoints included the incidence of acute rejection
episodes, the assessment of cardiac function (ejection

and shortening fractions), and treatment failure (defined
as death or withdrawal from the study for any reason).
Any time during participation, the treatment was to be
discontinued in patients of the low-dose group who
received less than 1.5 g MMF/day for more than 15 con￾secutive days.
In compliance with the intention-to-treat (ITT) ana￾lysis of the primary endpoint, patients who withdrew
early were followed up until the end of the study.
Strategy tolerance was assessed by the incidence of ad￾verse events. Vital signs (weight and clinical manifesta￾tions) and cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure,
lipid, and glucose profiles) were closely monitored at
each outpatient visit.
Clinical follow-up
Following standard clinical procedures, the patients were
monitored every two weeks during the first three
months, then at months 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 post￾transplantation to assess the efficacy and safety of the
strategy. Serum creatinine level was assessed at each
visit. Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, and albuminuria
were analysed at months 6 and 12. Cystatin C was
assessed at inclusion, then at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.
Endomyocardial biopsies were performed according to
local procedures. Biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes
were graded by a local pathologist using the Inter￾national Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation
(ISHLT) scale. All biopsies performed over the study
period were considered for analysis [16]. Acute rejection
episodes were considered serious adverse events and the
sponsor was immediately notified.
Statistical analysis
Forty-five patients in each group (53 recruited for a
drop-out of 15%) would ensure a 80% power to detect
an 18% reduction in serum creatinine level of the low￾dose group, at 12 months, assuming that the mean in
the standard-dose group is 140 μmol/L, the common
standard deviation is 43, and the two-sided two-group
t test significance level is 0.05 [17].
According to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle,
analyses were performed on all 95 randomised patients.
Given biological variability and the imprecision of
measurements, a mixed model of co-variance was used
to take into account all available measures. The main
analysis focused on a three- to twelve-month interval. It
tested the effects of treatment at three months (low dose
vs. standard dose) and whether the expected change
lasted until the end of follow-up, when both groups
started to receive the same low dose. Missing data were
included as random events. The treatment effect was
tested both on the intercept (treatment effect at three
months) and on the slope (interaction between
treatment and time of follow-up). The likelihood ratio
test was used for this test comparing the models given
below:
Model 1 : ηij ¼ β0 þ β1X1ij þ Ui0
Model 2 : ηij
¼ β0 þ β1X1ij þ β2X2 þ β3X1ijX2 þ Ui0
þ Ui1X1ijX2i
Where ηij is the predicted creatinine value (log10-
transformed) for patient i and measurement j, X1ij is the
time elapsed after transplantation (in days), X2i is the
patient group, X1ij X2i is the interaction between the pa￾tient group and the time interval, Ui0 is the random
intercept for patient i, and Ui1 is the random slope for
patient i.
A box plot distribution was used to describe changes
in creatinine level over time by treatment group.
A post hoc analysis was conducted on the primary
endpoint dichotomised according to a clinically mean￾ingful threshold (>120 μmol/L) in order to check that
the low dose was able to decrease the proportion of pa￾tient over this threshold after three months and/or up to
twelve months.
The threshold of 120 μmol/L was considered as clinic￾ally critical on the basis of literature data and clinical
observations [18,19]. Our hypothesis was that the low
dose could have a greater impact among the patients
with the highest creatinine values. A hierarchical logistic
regression model using a penalised quasi-likelihood
method (glmmPQL) was used to test this hypothesis.
The formula was similar to Model 2, but here, ηij was
the probability of having a creatinine level over the
threshold (logit transformation).
The statistical analysis used R and SASTM softwares.
Results
The flow diagram of the study is presented in Figure 1.
Between March 2004 and December 2005, 95 eligible
patients were included and randomised: 47 patients in
the low-dose group and 48 in the standard-dose group
of CsA treatment. The last follow-up visits took place in
December 2006. All 95 patients underwent heart trans￾plantation, received the assigned treatment, and were
included in the ITT analysis.
The study was completed by 33 patients in the low￾dose group and 38 patients in the standard-dose group.
In the two groups, treatment discontinuation was the
main reason for withdrawal; however, the number of dis￾continuations was lower in the standard-dose group
than in the low-dose group (10.4% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.039).

proportion of females in the standard-dose group than
in the low-dose group, all other variables were compa￾rable in the two groups of patients.
C0 levels were generally met in the two groups with
values in the upper end of the target range in the low￾dose group. For the first three months, C0 levels were
significantly higher in the standard-dose group than in
the low-dose group (P <0.001) but the two group distri￾butions overlapped with 16% of the values under the
threshold of 200 μmol/L in the standard-dose group and
17% of the values over the threshold of 130 μmol/L in
the low-dose group. As expected, from three months
after heart transplantation until the end of the study, C0
levels were similar in the two groups. All patients
received induction treatment with polyclonal antibodies
except for one patient in the standard-dose group.
Efficacy assessment
At 12 month post-transplantation, serum creatinine
levels were available for 91 patients. At intermediate vi￾sits, data were available for 89 to 91 patients. Some data
were missing for one to two patients at different study
time-points. Observed creatinine values displayed strong
individual variability. The results showed no significant
difference in renal function changes between the two
groups (P = 0.162) despite a trend towards a lower im￾pairment of renal function in the low-dose group be￾tween three and twelve months (Table 2).
Figure 2 presents a box plot distribution of observed
serum creatinine values. After one month of treatment
and during all of follow-up, the upper quartile was sys￾tematically lower in the low-dose group than in the
standard-dose group. At three months, the post hoc ana￾lysis in patients with baseline creatinine >120 μmol/L
showed a significantly lower number of patients above
the clinically defined threshold in the low-dose group
than in the standard-dose group (13% vs. 33%, P = 0.026)
but the difference did not remain statistically significant
thereafter and the treatment effect, as estimated by the
hierarchical logical regression model on all available
measures, was not statistically significant.
Other renal function parameters were favourable to the
low-dose regimen despite the absence of significant differ￾ences (except for Cystatin C at three months) (Table 2).

Safety assessment
Death
Four deaths were reported (Figure 1): one in the
low-dose group (septic shock) and three in the
standard-dose group (one herpetic infection with
hepatocellular dysfunction, one pseudomonas septi￾caemia associated with cytomegalovirus infection, and
one case of non-compliance with the immunosup￾pressive treatment). At 12 months, the survival was
comparable between the low-dose (97.9%) and the
standard-dose group (95.8%). No graft loss was
reported during the study period.
Immunosuppressive efficacy
The incidence of acute rejection episodes, whatever their
grade, was similar between the two groups (n = 41,
87.3%, in the low-dose group vs. n = 43, 91.5% in the
standard-dose group). Treatment for rejection episodes
graded 1B or higher concerned 20 patients (42.6%) in
the low-dose group and 17 patients (36.2%) in the
standard-dose group. The incidence of rejection episodes
graded 3A or higher, usually taken as serious by clini￾cians, was 17% in the low-dose group and 14.6% in the
standard-dose group (Table 3). The relative risk of severe
acute rejection was 1.14 (95% confidence interval (0.45
to 2.90)).
Study withdrawals
Treatment was discontinued in 10 patients of the low-dose
group who received a MMF dose below 1.5 g/day for more
than 15 consecutive days. Tacrolimus was used instead of
cyclosporine in three patients of the low-dose group and
five patients of the standard-dose group. Other reasons for
withdrawal were one renal failure and one deviation from
the protocol in the standard-dose group.
Other safety assessments
Excluding rejection episodes, at least one adverse event
was reported in 91.6% of the participants: 93.6% in the
low-dose group vs. 89.6% in the standard-dose group.
Serious adverse events were reported in 69.5% of the
participants: 72.3% in the low-dose group vs. 66.7% in
the standard-dose group.
During the study period, more dialysis episodes were
observed in the standard-dose group than in the low￾dose group, but the difference was not statistically

significant. Six patients had at least one dialysis episode:
one (2.1%) in the low-dose group vs. five (10.4%) in the
standard-dose group (P = 0.097).
The overall incidence of infections was similar be￾tween both groups. The incidence of cytomegalovirus in￾fection (PCR-positive, and/or infection) was 30% in the
low-dose group and 25% in the standard-dose group.
At 12 months, the mean systolic and diastolic blood
pressures were not significantly different: 136 ± 16.1 vs.
134 ± 13.5 and 85 ± 14 vs. 85 ± 11 in the low-dose and
standard dose groups, respectively. All patients received
statins and mean total cholesterol and triglyceride levels
remained within normal ranges and did not differ be￾tween the two groups (5.09 ± 1.12 vs. 5.07 ± 1.01 mmol/L
for cholesterol and 1.66 ± 0.86 vs. 1.58 ± 0.84 mmol/L for
triglycerides in the low-dose and the standard-dose
groups, respectively).
Discussion
Over 12 months, we observed less renal function impair￾ment in heart transplant patients receiving a low dose of
CsA than in those receiving a standard dose. However,
differences in creatinine levels between three and twelve
months were not statistically significant.
Several reasons may explain these results. First, the
observed difference at 12 months (12 μmol/L) was lower
than expected (24 μmol/L for an 18% reduction). Se￾cond, during the period under different dose regimens,
the two group distributions of blood CsA values over￾lapped. During the first three months in the low-dose
group, the C0 level remained at the upper end of the tar￾get range reflecting difficulties for physicians to signifi￾cantly reduce CsA doses. This difficulty has already been
reported [9]. Third, the primary endpoint was assessed
at 12 months; that is, after nine months of identical dose
regimens but the observed difference decreased after
three months under the same regimen. Therefore, the
low-dose strategy was not long enough to have a strong
impact on the results at 12 months. Fourth, the import￾ant heterogeneity of individual responses over time has
probably affected the power of the analysis. Finally, the
lower frequency of high creatinine values (upper quar￾tile) between three and twelve months in the low-dose
group suggests different response profiles possibly linked
to the severity of renal impairment. Even though less
patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine >120
μmol/L) were seen at three months in the low-dose
group, the post hoc analysis was not able to show a sta￾tistically significant effect, possibly because of a lack of
power.
Furthermore, a lower number of dialysis episodes were
reported in the low-dose group than in the standard￾dose group, but this was not statistically significant. A
meta-analysis by subgroup is being conducted to con￾firm whether or not patients with severe renal impair￾ment benefit from low-dose cyclosporine after heart
transplant. Other renal function indicators (creatinine
clearance, cystatin C) progressed at the same rate as our
primary endpoint, which is clinically consistent.
Overall, cardiac function remained stable and compa￾rable between the two treatment groups and, consist￾ently with other heart-transplant studies, serious adverse
events were frequent but not different between the two
groups.
An important number of patients under low-dose CsA
withdrew from the study because of intolerance to
MMF. In the study protocol, MMF <1.5 g/day for more
than 15 consecutive days was a reason for withdrawal
only in the low-dose group. Also, at the time of the trial,
the choice was made to maintain patients at 3 g MMF/day
without controlling blood levels. However, in patients with
renal insufficiency recommendations were changed to a
reduction of MMF dosage to 2 g/day and the use of
blood-level monitoring [20].
The present trial showed that there was no difference
between the two groups regarding the incidence of se￾vere acute rejection episodes. However, due to the small
size of the study, an increased risk of severe acute rejec￾tion episodes in the low-dose group cannot be excluded.
The use of post hoc combined criteria that include dialy￾sis plus death (two cases in the low-dose group vs. eight
cases in the standard-dose group, P = 0.049) may lead to
benefits when reducing CsA soon after heart transplant￾ation. These results could be relevant to 25% of patients
in the first year after heart transplant, who take CsA as a
first-line treatment [21].

Several limitations of our study have to be acknowl￾edged. These include the small number of new heart
transplantations in France, possible biases related to the
open-label design of the study, the choice of an endpoint
devoid of direct clinical relevance, and the insufficient
power to address all dimensions of the risk/benefit ratio
of the newly proposed strategy. Nevertheless, this study
is the first French multicentre trial in heart transplant￾ation that addressed this daily specialist concern. Ob￾viously, our results cannot be viewed as a definitive
answer to the issue of the risk/benefit ratio of the CsA
reduction strategy, but they may foster future research
in the same direction and orient future studies towards a
success/failure approach. They explore whether patients
fitting particular individual profiles are more likely to
benefit from a low-dose CsA strategy.
Conclusions
In patients with de novo cardiac transplantation, early
Cyclosporine A dose reduction was not associated with
renal benefit at 12 months. However, the strategy may
benefit patients with high creatinine levels before
transplantation.
