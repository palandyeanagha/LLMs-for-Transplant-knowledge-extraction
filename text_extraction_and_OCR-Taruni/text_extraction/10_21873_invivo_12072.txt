Abstract. Aim: To elucidate the common and different
points between sarcopenia and frailty in chronic liver
damage (CLD). Patients and Methods: Patients with both
grip strength decline and skeletal muscle index decline were
regarded as sarcopenia. Frailty was defined as a syndrome
in which 3 or more of the following criteria were met: i)
exhaustion, ii) body weight loss, iii) slow walking speed, iv)
muscle weakness, and v) low physical activity. Results:
Sarcopenia and frailty were identified in 52 patients (15.2%)
and 46 (13.5%), respectively. The prevalence of sarcopenia
and frailty was well stratified according to age and the liver
cirrhosis (LC) status. In the multivariate analysis, we
identified significant factors for sarcopenia: i) age, ii) LC,
iii) body mass index and iv) extracellular water (ECW) to
total body water (TBW) ratio, while only the ECW to TBW
ratio was significant for frailty. Conclusion: Sarcopenia and
frailty in CLD should be separately evaluated.
In individuals with chronic liver damage (CLD), metabolic
functions are frequently damaged leading to several
nutritional disorders, including protein-energy-malnutrition,
or muscle abnormalities (1). Since sarcopenia, as assessed by
muscle mass decrease and muscle strength impairment in
patients with CLD, can be related to falls, poor quality of life
or poor prognosis, it has become a very interesting topic to
examine for physicians (2-8). Sarcopenia is one of the most
common consequences found in patients with liver cirrhosis
(LC), affecting 30% to 70% of LC patients, and it can be a
main determinant for the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy
in LC patients (1, 9, 10-13). Japanese CLD patients can now
be found in aging populations, and this fact is also a crucial
public health issue since aging itself can cause sarcopenia
(14-16). To avoid unfavorable consequences related to
sarcopenia one needs to assess this disease as a condition
with a systemic involvement (17-19). Improving physical
activity or nutrition and adequately managing any underlying
diseases are essential steps for avoiding sarcopenia (6).
Frailty is a concept globally used in geriatrics that
precedes disability, and is defined as a condition of increased
vulnerability associated with physiological decline (20-22).
Originally, it was proposed to identify elderly people at an
elevated risk of adverse health outcomes, dependencies, falls,
disabilities, and mortality (20-22). Frailty is determined
based on the evaluation of physical, functional and cognitive
abilities. The frailty phenotype is defined as the presence of
3 or more of the following criteria: i) body weight (BW)
loss, ii) self-reported exhaustion, iii) skeletal muscle function
decline, iv) slow walking speed (WS) and v) low physical
activity (23, 24). Sarcopenia is an important component of
frailty (22). Aging is indeed closely linked to changes in
body composition, especially skeletal muscle mass decline,
resulting in disability and mortality (14, 16, 24). While any
chronic organ dysfunction can also lead to physiological
vulnerability (25-27). CLDs are not the exception. Carey, et
al. have reported that a six-minute walk reflecting physical
function shows a good prediction of mortality for liver

transplant candidates (25). It was this study that raised an
awareness for frailty in patients with CLDs.
The strong overlap between sarcopenia and frailty that can
be seen in CLD leads to a condition termed physical frailty
(19, 25). To translate the clinical relevance of sarcopenia and
frailty into practice, borders and bridges between the two
should be clearly defined. The aims of the study were to
identify the common and different points between sarcopenia
and frailty in patients with CLD.
Patients and Methods
Patients. Three hundred and forty-one CLD patients subjected to
evaluation for both sarcopenia and frailty consulted our hospital
between July 2015 and October 2019. LC was determined by: i)
liver biopsy analysis, ii) radiological findings (deformation of the
liver surface, varices or splenomegaly, etc.), iii) liver fibrosis
markers, and iv) laboratory data (lower platelet count or prolonged
prothrombin time, etc.) (28-31).
Grip strength (GS) was measured according to the current
guidelines, and decreased GS was defined as <26 kg for men and
<18 kg for women (14). The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was tested
using bioimpedance analysis (BIA) as described previously (32).
SMI decline was defined as <7.0 kg/m2 in men and <5.7 kg/m2 in
women referring to the guidelines (14). Patients with both GS
decline and SMI decline were regarded as having sarcopenia (14).
In all analyzed subjects, the six-meter walking test was done. The
test was performed twice in each subject and the walking speed
(WS; m/s) was defined as the mean value of the two measured
speeds.
Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which 3 or more
of the following criteria were met: i) unintentional BW loss (2 or
3 kg or more within the past 6 months), ii) self-reported
exhaustion, iii) muscle weakness (GS<26 kg in men and <18 kg in
women), iv) slow WS (<1.0 m/s), and v) low physical activity
(doing light exercise or not), while pre-frailty was defined as
patients with one or two of the aforementioned phenotypes.
Patients with none of the 5 phenotypes were regarded as having a
robust status (23, 24).
Due to the intrinsic limitations of BIA, such as the presence of
ascites (14), patients with severe ascites were not included in this
study. We compared the impact of sarcopenia and frailty in CLD
patients in a retrospective manner. Factors associated with
sarcopenia or frailty were identified in both univariate and
multivariate analysis. In addition, we classified the study cohort into
four groups: i) patients with sarcopenia alone (type A), ii) patients
with frailty alone (type B), iii) patients with both sarcopenia and
frailty (type C) and iv) patients with neither sarcopenia or frailty
(type D). Baseline characteristics were compared among the four
types.
The institutional review board in our hospital acknowledged this
research protocol, and the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki was strictly
adhered to ensure the rights of the patients. Due to the retrospective
nature of this study, an opt out approach was employed in order to
obtain informed consent from the subjects.
Statistics. The JMP 14 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was
used for our statistical analyses. For the numerical variables, Mann￾Whitney U-test, Student’s t-test, analysis of variance or Kruskal￾Wallis tests were used to adequately assess group characteristics.
For the categorical variables, Fisher’s exact test or Pearson χ2 test
was used to assess group characteristics. Baseline significant items
in our univariate analysis were subjected to the multivariate logistic
regression analysis to select candidate parameters. Data were
demonstrated as median values [interquartile range (IQR)]. The
statistically significant level was set at p<0.05.

Prevalence of sarcopenia or frailty according to age.
Prevalence of sarcopenia in patients <65 years, 65-75 years
and ≥75 years were 4.5% (7/155), 20.0% (26/130) and
33.9% (19/56), respectively (p<0.0001) (Figure 1A).
Prevalence of frailty in patients <65 years, 65-75 years and
≥75 years were 5.2% (8/155), 19.2% (25/130) and 23.2%
(13/56), respectively (p=0.0002) (Figure 1B). Prevalence of
pre-frailty or frailty in patients <65 years, 65-75 years and
≥75 years were 56.8% (88/155), 73.1% (95/130) and 89.3%
(50/56), respectively (p<0.0001).
Prevalence of sarcopenia or frailty according to body mass
index. Prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with body mass
index (BMI) <20 kg/m2, >20 kg/m2, <25 kg/m2 and ≥25
kg/m2 were 25.8% (16/62), 20.0% (35/175), and 1.0%
(1/104), respectively (p<0.0001) (Figure 2A). Prevalence of
frailty in patients with BMI <20 kg/m2, >20 kg/m2, <25
kg/m2 and ≥25 kg/m2 were 17.7% (11/62), 12.0% (21/175),
and 13.5% (14/104), respectively (p=0.5237) (Figure 2B).
Proportion of LC in patients with sarcopenia and non￾sarcopenia, and in patients with frailty and non-frailty. The
proportion of LC in sarcopenic patients was significantly
higher compared to non-sarcopenic patients [55.8% (29/52)
vs. 32.2% (93/289), p=0.0016] (Figure 3A). The proportion
of LC in patients with frailty was significantly higher
compared to patients with non-frailty [67.4% (31/46) vs.
30.9% (91/295), p<0.0001] (Figure 3B).
Proportion of WS decrease, fatigue, BW loss and low
physical activity in patients with sarcopenia or non￾sarcopenia. The proportion of WS decrease in patients with
sarcopenia was significantly higher compared to patients
with non-sarcopenia [36.5% (19/52) vs. 11.1% (32/289),

p<0.0001], while no significant link was observed in patients
presenting with fatigue and BW loss [fatigue: 55.8% (29/52)
vs. 48.1% (139/289), p=0.3665; and BW loss: 5.8% (3/52)
vs. 4.2% (12/289), p=0.7104] (Figures 4A-C). The
proportion of low physical activity in patients with
sarcopenia was higher with a tendency for significance
compared to patients with non-sarcopenia [36.5% (19/52) vs.
24.6% (71/289), p=0.0870] (Figure 4D).
Uni- and multivariate analyses of factors related to the
presence of sarcopenia. In the univariate analysis, i) age
(p=0.0458), ii) presence of LC (p=0.0016), iii) serum
albumin level (p=0.0017), iv) BMI (p<0.0001), v) ALBI
score (p=0.0357), and vi) extracellular water (ECW) to total
body water (TBW) ratio (p<0.0001) were significant factors
associated with the presence of sarcopenia (Table II). The
ALBI score includes total bilirubin and serum albumin; thus,
the serum albumin level was not included in the multivariate
analysis. In the multivariate analysis for the remaining 5
factors, i) advanced age (p=0.0114), ii) presence of LC
(p=0.0227), iii) lower BMI (p<0.0001) and iv) higher ECW
to TBW ratio (p=0.0002) were identified as significant for
the presence of sarcopenia (Table III).
Uni- and multivariate analyses of factors related to the
presence of frailty. In the univariate analysis, i) age
(p=0.0002), ii) presence of LC (<0.0001), iii) serum albumin
level (p<0.0001), iv) ALBI score (p<0.0001), v) alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) (p=0.0065), vi) branched-chain amino
acid to tyrosine ratio (BTR) (p=0.0083) and vii) ECW to
TBW ratio (p<0.0001) were significant factors associated
with the presence of frailty (Table IV). Serum albumin level
was not included in the multivariate analysis due to the same
reason as mentioned above. In the multivariate analysis for
the remaining 6 factors, only a higher ECW to TBW ratio
(p<0.0001) was found to be significantly linked to the
presence of frailty (Table V).
Comparison of baseline characteristics among the four
groups (type A, B, C and D). There were 32 patients (9.4%)
with type A, 26 (7.6%) with type B, 20 (5.9%) with type C
and 263 (77.1%) with type D. Comparing baseline
characteristics among the four groups, overall significance
was noted in terms of: i) age (p<0.0001) (Figure 5A), ii)
BMI (p<0.0001) (Figure 5B), iii) ECW to TBW ratio
(p<0.0001) (Figure 5C), iv) serum albumin level (p<0.0001)
(Figure 5D), v) ALBI score (p=0.0002) (Figure 5E), vi) ALP
(p=0.0017) (Figure 5F), vii) BTR (p=0.0015, Figure 5G),
and viii) proportion of LC (p<0.0001) (Figure 6). The
prevalence of LC in each type was: i) 53.1% (17/32) in type
A, ii) 73.1% (19/26) in type B, iii) 60.0% (12/20) in type C,
and iv) 28.1% (74/263) in type D. The p-Values from the

synonyms. Few studies have assessed both sarcopenia and
frailty as such in CLDs. Banjhi et al. have reported that in
both alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,
there was a large difference between the prevalence of
sarcopenia on computed tomography scans and frailty (40).
Despite the overlap between definitions and diagnostic
criteria, sarcopenia is not identical to frailty. Frailty is a
multidimensional clinical entity involving not only the
muscle status but also the well-being, disabilities,
exhaustion, dependencies and cognitive status. While skeletal
muscle mass decline and functional decline can be a strong
substratum of frailty (41), the opposite does not always stand
true and the absence of sarcopenia certainly does not always
deny the presence of frailty. Clues for frailty should lead to
an assessment of body composition. Based on these facts
regarding sarcopenia and frailty in CLDs, we believe that
common and different points in sarcopenia and frailty for
patients with CLDs should be clarified.
In our data, there were 32 patients (9.4%) with type A
(sarcopenia alone), 26 (7.6%) with type B (frailty alone), and
20 (5.9%) with type C (both sarcopenia and frailty). In
addition, i) advanced age, ii) presence of LC, iii) a lower BMI

and iv) a higher ECW to TBW ratio were independent
predictors for sarcopenia, while only a higher ECW to TBW
ratio was an independent predictor for frailty. By comparing
between type A and type B, significant differences were noted
in terms of BMI, ECW to TBW ratio and BTR. These
findings raised our awareness that sarcopenia and frailty in
CLDs are not synonymous. On the other hand, a significantly
high proportion of LC in sarcopenic and frailty patients
compared with each counterpart (i.e., not sarcopenic and not
frailty patients) implies that underlying liver diseases can be
involved not only in sarcopenia but also in frailty,
highlighting common points between the two conditions in
CLDs. Stratification of the prevalence of sarcopenia or frailty
according to age is another common points between the two
conditions in CLDs. While sarcopenia was associated with a
WS decline and a low physical activity, it was not associated
with fatigue or BW loss. Sarcopenia in CLDs is indeed
similar to physical frailty (41). Sarcopenia may be the
dominant driver of the physical frailty phenotype, especially
in LC patients where hepatic synthetic impairment may
accelerate the skeletal muscle mass decrease (14, 42, 43).
In our data, 13.5% of our patients had frailty, while
Fozouni et al. have reported that out of 291 LC patients, 54
LC patients (19%) had frailty (42). This is probably due to
the difference of background patient population (prevalence
of LC: 35.8% in our data vs. 100% in the study by Fozouni
et al.) (42). Age-stratified meta-analyses reported by Kojima
et al. have demonstrated that the pooled prevalence of frailty
among elderly people living in Japan was 1.9% (65-69
years), 3.8% (70-74 years), 10.0% (75-79 years), 20.4% (80-
84 years), and 35.1% (85 years or more) (44). In our data,
the prevalence of frailty in patients <65 years, 65-69 years,
70-74 years, 75-79 years, 80-84 years and ≥85 years were
5.2% (8/155), 8.8% (6/68), 30.7% (19/62), 27.0% (10/37),
15.4% (2/13) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively. Especially in our
CLD patients aged 70-74 years, the prevalence of frailty was
prominently higher compared to similar age elderly people
living in Japan, which may be linked to the influence of
underlying CLDs on frailty. Notably, a pre-frailty status
(frailty score 1 or 2) was identified in 54.8% of our patients.
Clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of the pre￾frailty status in CLDs. Early identification of frailty in CLDs
can lead to optimization of the CLD patients with the
potential for avoiding poor outcomes (45).
Elevated ECW to TBW ratio was an independent factor
associated with both the presence of sarcopenia and frailty.
ECW to TBW ratio defines the extracellular fluid status (water
homeostasis) in the whole body and the liver functional
reserve (46, 47). Excessive extracellular fluid in CLDs may
also lead to the physical functional decline as well as a
cognitive decline, which can be linked to our current results
(48-50). Excessive extracellular fluid in the brain can cause
cognitive decline (49, 50). While, notably, the prevalence of
sarcopenia was closely linked to BMI, however, frailty was

not in the multivariate analyses. These results suggest that
lower BMI in CLDs involves a poorer muscle status, however,
it does not involve phenotypes other than muscle status. Also,
in CLDs, higher BMI itself cannot exclude the possibility of
frailty although CLD patients with higher BMI have low
possibility for sarcopenia. This can be a significant different
point between sarcopenia and frailty in CLDs.
Several limitations associated with the study should be
mentioned. Firstly, this was a retrospective cross-sectional
observational study with patients from a single hospital.
Secondly, our data included population data from CLDs
patients in Japan, thus, additional studies on patients from other
parts of the world are necessary to confirm and expand or adapt
our results for each population. Thirdly, patients with large
ascites who could suffer from a WS decline were excluded due
to the limits of BIA, possibly making this a bias. Finally, due
to the cross-sectional nature of our study, the causal
relationship between sarcopenia and frailty is unclear.
Interpretation with caution to our data is needed. Our study
results nevertheless implied that sarcopenia and frailty in CLDs
had several common and a few different points. In conclusion,
sarcopenia and frailty in CLDs are not synonyms. These two
important clinical entities should be separately evaluated.
