Abstract


OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with constrictive
pericarditis have changes in collagen content and architecture that
could influence left ventricular function. DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Biopsy
specimens of myocardium from 13 patients admitted consecutively
for treatment of chronic constrictive pericarditis were compared
with normal heart tissue taken at necropsy from 15 patients free of
cardiac disease. INTERVENTION: Pericardiectomy through median
sternotomy. Biopsy specimens (4 or 5) were taken from the left
ventricular free wall. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biochemical
and histological assessment of total collagen content, relative
proportion of type I and III collagen, and amount of orthogonal
collagen fibre meshwork (crosshatching) in the left ventricular
tissue. RESULTS: There was more collagen in the myocardium of
patients with constrictive pericarditis than in controls when
measured either biochemically by hydroxyproline content (89.4 v
50.4 mg/g dry weight) or by histological measurement of the
collagen fraction of the myocardium (2.4% v 7.0%). Neither of
these measurements, however, correlated with left ventricular
ejection fraction, pulmonary wedge pressure, or right ventricular
end diastolic pressure. The thickness of the fibrous trabeculae in the
myocardium was, however, inversely related to both left ventricular
ejection fraction (r = -0.76) and deceleration time (r = -0.68).
Trabecular thickening was also related to NYHA class, with those in
class III and IV having the greatest thickening. CONCLUSION:
Changes in collagen content and architecture may contribute to
impaired ventricular function in patients with chronic constrictive
pericarditis.
