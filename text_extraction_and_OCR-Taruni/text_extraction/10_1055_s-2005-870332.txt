Izquierdo Rubio S et al. Polyp as a Complication of APC in Watermelon Stomach ´ Endoscopy 2005; 37: 921
Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), or
watermelon stomach, is an uncommon
cause of gastrointestinal blood loss and
iron−deficiency anaemia, that usually re−
quires periodic blood transfusions. Endo−
scopic treatments, including endoscopic
sclerotherapy, coagulation with Nd:YAG
and argon lasers, argon plasma coagula−
tion (APC), heater probe therapy, cryo−
therapy, and monopolar and multipolar
electrocoagulation, are now the ap−
proaches of choice [1]. They are effective
and safe, reducing transfusion require−
ments in these patients, although some
complications have been reported [2±4].
We report an uncommon complication in
a patient with GAVE that had been treated
by APC.
A 75−year−old woman, with liver cirrhosis
and portal hypertension associated with
the hepatitis C virus, had experienced
several episodes of anemia (hematocrit
below 20%; normal range 36%±47%) in
the previous 10 months, without macro−
scopic signs of bleeding. Despite oral iron
supplementation, she required eight
blood transfusions in this period. Upper
endoscopy revealed a typical image of
watermelon stomach, with visible col−
umns of vessels traversing the antrum in
longitudinal folds and converging in the
pylorus (Figure 1), and thus APC treat−
ment was given. Four sessions of APC
were required to avoid the need for trans−
fusion. During the last upper endoscopy
we observed a peduncular polyp in the
previously treated area (Figure 2). This
was removed by polypectomy and histo−
pathological examination showed it to be
a hyperplastic polyp.
Although endoscopic treatments for GAVE
are safe and effective, some complications
have been described. Reported complica−
tions of Nd:YAG laser treatment include
antral strictures, perforations, develop−
ment of hyperplastic polyps, and a case
of gastric multifocal neoplasia [2±3]. Al−
though such complications are uncom−
mon after APC treatment, antral stricture
[4,5] and a case of hyperplastic polyp
(DM Chaves, personal communication ci−
ted in [1]) have been reported following
APC. Even though the development of a
hyperplastic polyp more usually occurs
after Nd:YAG laser treatment, we must
consider this possibility when we observe
a polyp after APC treatment in a patient
with GAVE.
