Abstract
miRNAs have emerged as important players in the regulation of gene expression and their deregulation is a common
feature in a variety of diseases, especially cancer. Currently, many efforts are focused on studying miRNA expression
patterns, as well as miRNA target validation. Here, we show that the over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster in
HEK293T cells induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent pathway as proved by the annexin
assay, caspase activation, release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) from mitochondria. Furthermore, the
over expressed cluster modulates the expression of a number of genes involved in apoptosis including FADD (Fas
Associated protein with Death Domain). Bioinformatically, FADD is predicted to be the target of hsa-miR-27a and
interestingly, FADD protein was found to be up regulated consistent with very less expression of hsa-miR-27a in HEK293T
cells. This effect was direct, as hsa-miR-27a negatively regulated the expression of FADD 39UTR based reporter construct.
Moreover, we also showed that over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 sensitized HEK293T cells to TNF-a cytotoxicity. Taken
together, our study demonstrates that enhanced TNF-a induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells by over expression of miR￾23a,27a,24-2 cluster provides new insights in the development of novel therapeutics for cancer.

Introduction
miRNAs are a class of highly conserved, non-coding single￾stranded RNAs (18–24 nt) derived from the endogenously
produced pre-miRNA (precursor) having a hairpin (stem-loop)
structure [1–3]. miRNAs refine gene expression post-transcrip￾tionally either via the cleavage of target mRNAs or the inhibition
of translation of target mRNAs depending upon complementarity
between miRNA and the 39 untranslated regions (UTRs) of
targeted mRNA in animals and plants [4–8]. The emerging role of
miRNAs in the regulation of fundamental set of cellular
mechanisms such as proliferation, apoptosis, development, differ￾entiation and metabolism [9–16] clearly suggests that any
aberration in miRNA biogenesis pathway or its activity contributes
to the human disease pathogenesis including cancer [17]. Recent
findings have also demonstrated that miRNAs could act either as
potential oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes [18,19].
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated,
morphologically and biochemically distinct physiological cell death
event which is accompanied by cytoskeletal disruption, cell
shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and
internucleosomal DNA fragmentation [20]. Caspases, a family of
aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, play a critical role in the
execution of apoptosis. Broadly caspases can be divided into two
types - Initiator and Effector. Initiator caspases, with long
prodomains, such as caspases-8, -9 and -10, either directly or
indirectly activate effector caspases, such as caspases-3, -6 and -7.
These effector caspases then cleave intracellular substrates,
including structural and regulatory proteins such as cytokeratin,
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and are directly responsible
for many of the morphological features of apoptosis [21].
Literature also shows that cells can undergo apoptosis in
caspase-dependent and/or -independent manner. Caspase-depen￾dent pathway can be further divided based on the initiator
caspases into the extrinsic pathway or intrinsic pathway. The
extrinsic pathway (the death receptor-mediated pathway) is
triggered by the members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor super family. Binding of the ligand to its cognate receptor
results in receptor trimerisation and subsequent recruitment of the
dual adaptor molecule FADD leading to rapid activation of
caspase-8 through recruitment of procaspase-8. Intrinsic pathway
(the mitochondrial-mediated pathway) is activated in response to a
variety of stress conditions, such as cytotoxic drugs, UV irradiation
or growth factor withdrawal, which induce mitochondrial
perturbation and the cytoplasmic release of pro-apoptotic
mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome-c leading to the
activation of caspase-9. Both pathways finally lead to activation
of caspase-3, the executioner caspase responsible for the final
morphological changes observed during apoptosis. Accumulating
evidences suggest that a cross-talk between two pathways exists in

cells as the active caspase-8 cleaves a BH3-domain-only subfamily
protein, Bid. This truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochon￾dria and mediates cytochrome-c release [22]. Caspase- indepen￾dent pathway occurs via the translocation of AIF (Apoptosis
Inducing Factor) from the mitochondria towards the nucleus;
ultimately resulting in apoptosis [23].
Resistance towards apoptosis is a key factor for the survival of a
malignant cell. Cancer results if there is too little apoptosis and
cells grow faster and live longer than normal cells. In addition,
defects in apoptosis signaling contribute to drug resistance of
tumor cells. Thus, one of the main goals for oncologic treatment is
to overcome resistance of tumor cells towards apoptosis. The
exciting challenge in oncology is to translate the growing
knowledge of apoptotic pathways into clinical applications.
The objective of the present study was to examine the role of the
miRNA cluster (miR-23a,27a,24-2) in apoptosis. Understand￾ing the role of miRNA in apoptosis is likely to provide deeper
insights into various disease processes and thus totally revolution￾ize the scientific approach towards developing therapies against
these diseases. Since their discovery, a number of bioinformatic
softwares have come up predicting the targets of miRNAs, yet very
few miRNA-target interactions have been validated experimen￾tally.
Here, we show that the over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2
cluster in HEK293T cells induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent
as well as -independent pathway. We also show that hsa-miR-27a
negatively regulated the expression of FADD.
FADD/Mort1 is a cytosolic adaptor molecule which is critical
for signaling from CD95 (FAS/Apo1) and certain other members
of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family (called death
receptors). Two protein interaction domains have been identified
in FADD. The C-terminal ‘‘death domain’’ (DD) is needed for
recruitment of FADD/Mort1 to ligated death receptor and N￾terminal ‘‘death effector domain’’ (DED) mediates oligomerization
and activation of caspase-8 zymogens. Caspase-8 activates other
caspases by cleavage and this starts a proteolytic cascade which
constitutes the ‘‘point of no return’’ in apoptotic signaling. Besides
its role in apoptosis, this protein has also been implicated in
survival/proliferation and cell cycle progression. FADD can also
function as tumor suppressor gene [25]. Many reports also reveal
the underexpression of FADD in several cancers like thyroid
adenoma and acute myeloid leukemia [26,27]. Lack of FADD
protein confers survival/growth advantages in tumor cells.
The diverse roles of FADD ranging from cell survival to cell
death and little knowledge of regulation of FADD expression
makes it an interesting subject to study and we believe that finding
a miRNA targeting this gene would add a new dimension to the
ongoing research in the cancer therapeutics.
Materials and Methods
Sequences retrieval, Primer Designing and Cloning
The sequences of miRNAs were retrieved from miRbase
(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/), the 39 UTR sequence
was retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/
entrez/) and for primer designing primer 3 software was used
(http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). We cloned 39 UTR of FADD gene
into pMIR-REPORT miRNA Expression Reporter Vector

following primers: CCG CCG AAG CTT CAT CTC TGC TCC
AAG CAT CA and CCG CCG GGA TCC TCT CTT TCT
CCC CTC CAG GT and cloned in pSilencer4.1 vector (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA). The resulting plasmids were sequenced to
ensure accuracy.
Cell Culture and Transfection
A549 (NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular
adenocarcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), H520 (lung carci￾noma), HEK293T (human embryonic kidney), MCF7 (breast
carcinoma), Hep2 (laryngeal carcinoma) and Neuro2A (rat
neuronal) cells were obtained from National Centre for Cell
Science, Pune, India and maintained in DMEM medium
containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin in a humid￾ified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For luciferase assay, the cells were
cotransfected in 6-well plates by using lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
with 1 mg of the luciferase reporter vector, 1 mg of pSilencer4.1

Ambion Austin, TX, USA). For each well 40 nM/80 nM anti￾miR-27a (Ambion Austin, TX, USA) was used as indicated.
Luciferase and b-gal assays were done simultaneously on the cells
24 h after transfection using Promega kits. For over expression
studies, the cells were cotransfected in 6-well plates by using
lipofectamine 2000 with either 2 mg or 4 mg of the pSilencer 4.1
expressing the miRNA cluster.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA,
USA). Reverse transcription was carried out with M-MuLV
reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol using 2 mg of total RNA. Primers for
miR-23a (CCG CCG GGA TCC ACG GCC GGC TGG GGT

denaturation at 94uC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94uC for
30 sec, 56uC for 45 sec, 72uC for 45 sec, and an additional cycle
with extension at 72uC for 5 min. The normalization was done
using b-actin RT-PCR.
RT-PCR and real-time TaqMan PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and reverse
transcription was carried out with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers for pre-miR-24-

CA) that include specific RT primers and TaqMan probes were
used to quantify the expression of mature miR-27a (PN4373287)
and miR-24-2 (PN4373072). 18 s rRNA (PN 4333760F) was used
for normalization. The real time PCR data was normalized using

Annexin-V assay
Surface exposure of phosphatidylserine in apoptotic cells was
measured by Guava Nexin Kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Guava Technologies, Hayward, California, USA).
Annexin-PE fluorescence was analyzed by cytosoft software
(Guava Technologies, Hayward, California, USA). Wherever
indicated HEK293T cells were pre-treated with BOC-D-FMK
(broad caspase inhibitor, 300 mM, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri,
USA) for 30 min before transfection.
Measurement of intracellular ROS generation,
mitochondrial membrane potential (Dym) and
cytochrome-c release
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using DiOC6
(3,39-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide) dye and ROS production
was measured using DCFH-DA (29,79-dichlorfluorescein-diace￾tate) by flow cytometry as described before [29]. In brief,
untransfected and p(23a,27a,24-2) transfected HEK293T cells
were washed with PBS and DCFH-DA (5 mM) or fluorochrome
DiOC6 (40 nM) was added 30 min prior to harvesting. Fluores￾cence intensity was monitored using flow cytometer (Guava
Technologies, Hayward, California, USA). A minimum of 10,000
events were counted.
Cytochrome-c release was observed using Cell Fractionation Kit
from BD Biosciences [30]. In brief, untransfected and
p(23a,27a,24-2) transfected HEK293T cells were trypsinized,
harvested, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 100 ml of
lysis buffer. The cells were then homogenized and centrifuged to
separate mitochondrial pellet and cytosolic fraction. Cytochrome-c
release was analyzed in cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction by
immunoblotting. Cox IV was used to check the purity of cytosolic
and mitochondrial fraction. Equal loading was confirmed using b￾actin.
Protein preparation and western blot analysis
Untransfected and p(23a,27a,24-2) transfected HEK293T
cells were trypsinized and cell pellets were lysed with modified
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin,
1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM sodium fluoride) and kept in ice
for 30 min. Lysate was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min and
supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of sample
lysates (40 mg) were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate -
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to
PVDF membrane (mdi, Advanced Microdevices, India). The
membrane was blocked with 3% skim milk in Tris buffered saline
(20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween-20 for
1 h and then incubated with primary antibody (FADD/caspase 8/
caspase 3/PARP/Bid/Bcl-2/Bax) in 1% skim milk for 2 h
followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibody
(anti-mouse ALP linked or/anti-rabbit HRP linked) for 1 h. Blots
were developed using enzyme based chemiluminescence assays
(Alkaline phosphatase or Horse-radish peroxidase) using NBT￾BCIP or DAB as substrate. Equal loading of protein was
confirmed using b-actin antibody or GAPDH antibody. All
experiments were repeated at least three times; representative
results are presented [31].
Quantitiative and Statistical analysis of western blot data
Measurement of signal intensity on PVDF membranes after
western blotting with various antibodies was performed using
AlphaImager 3400 (Alpha InnoTech Corporation, San Leandro,
California). All data were expressed as integrated density values
(IDV). For FADD, Caspase 3, Caspase 8, Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, PARP
the IDV values were calculated as the density values of the specific
protein bands/b actin or GAPDH density values. All figures
showing quantitative analysis include data from atleast three
independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with
student’s two tailed t-test using SPSS (windows version 7.5); values
of p#0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Northern Blotting
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. For Northern blotting, the total RNA
(40 mg) was run on a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel, transferred to
a Hybond N+ membrane using semidry apparatus (BioRad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and UV-crosslinked (Stratalinker). The blot
was probed with a RNA probe using miRVana probe construction
kit (Ambion Austin, TX, USA). The blot was scanned in the
phosphorimager after overnight exposure. The normalization of
the result was done by stripping the blot in 0.01% SDS at 80uC for
2 hours and probing it for U6 expression.

Probe U6: TGC TAA TCT TCT CTG TAT CG
Luciferase assay
Twenty-four hours before transfection, HEK293T cells were
plated in 6-well plate. pMIR-REPORT miRNA Expression
Reporter Vector containing 39UTR region of the FADD and/or
p-Silencer 4.1 vector expressing hsa-miR-23a,27a,24-2
(p(23a,27a,24-2)) were transfected into HEK293T cells using
lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) as described by the
manufacturer. pCDNA 3.1/anti-miR-23a/anti-miR-27a/anti￾miR-24-2 (40 nm/80 nm Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) were also
used wherever indicated. Luciferase activity was measured using
Luciferase Kit Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
readings were taken on the luminometer (Berthold AutoLumat
LB953 rack luminometer). Luciferase activity was then normalized
by b-galactosidase activity for transfection in each well.
Reporter assay
The pNF-kB-luc reporter plasmid containing direct repeats of
the transcription recognition sequence for NF- kB (path detect
NF- kB Cis-Reporting system) was a kind gift from Zdenek
Dvorak. For reporter assay, untransfected and p(23a,27a,24-2)
transfected HEK293T cells were taken and following 8 h
incubation period, cells were treated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) for
16 h. At the end of treatment, cells were lysed and luciferase
activity was measured and standardized per milligram of protein
[32].
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy
Cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plate (Tarsons) at
1.66105 to 26105 per well for 24 h prior to transfection.
Transfection was done with p(23a,27a,24-2) using lipofectamine
2000 as described by the manufacturer. Cells were rinsed with
PBS and fixed with ice-cold acetone: methanol mix (1:1) for
10 min at 220uC. They were rinsed again and permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. This
was followed by washing with PBS and consequently blocking for
45 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature,

washed with PBS, and incubated with anti-AIF antibody (1:50,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h 30 min at room temperature.
Then, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the
secondary antibody anti-mouse-TRITC conjugated (1:200, Ban￾galore Genei) for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were
washed with PBS and stained with DAPI (0.5 ug/ml) for 10 min.
Fluorescent images were acquired through a Confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) [33].
Results
Expression of miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-24-2 in HEK293T
cells after p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster over expression
We first did northern blot analysis to determine the expression
of miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-24-2 in HEK293T cells. As shown
in Fig. 1A, northern blot analysis for microRNAs showed that
only microRNA 27a was abundantly expressed in the mature
form in HEK293T cells after over expression of
p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster. MicroRNA 23a levels were not
detectable and there was no change in the mature form of
microRNA 24-2 before and after p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster over
expression.
To better address the expression levels of miR-23a, miR-27a
and miR-24-2 in HEK293T cells before and after
p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster over expression, we did time course
study using semiquantitative PCR. Fig. 1B shows that expression
of microRNA 23a was very low whereas the expression levels of
microRNA 24-2 and microRNA 27a were significantly high after
p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster over expression in HEK293T cells as
compared to untransfected HEK293T cells. To further confirm
the semiquantitative PCR result, we did SYBR green based real
time PCR assay for the precursor form and TaqMan based real
time PCR assay for the mature form of miR-24-2 and miR-27a. As
inferred from the Fig. 1C (i, ii), there was a very significant
increase in the precursor form of both miR-24-2 and miR-27a and
there was 1.66 fold increase in the levels of the mature form of
microRNA 24-2 and 1.42 fold increase in the levels of the mature
form of microRNA 27a (Fig. 1C iii, iv) after p(23a,27a,24-2)
cluster over expression in HEK293T cells as compared to
untransfected HEK293T cells.
p(23a,27a,24-2) induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells
A number of studies have demonstrated that microRNAs can
act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors [34–35]. Infact, the same

microRNA can act as an oncogene in one biological condition and
as a tumor suppressor gene in another [18,36]. Recent report
suggests that upregulation of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster decreas￾es transforming growth factor-beta induced tumor suppressive
activities in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells [37]. In the
present study we wanted to investigate the biological effects of over
expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the annexin positive cells increased to
33.2%60.8% (p = 0.024) after over expression of miRNA cluster
in HEK293T as compared to 2.5%60.3% (p = 0.016) in
untransfected HEK293T cells. Moreover, in the presence of
caspase inhibitor (BOC-D-FMK) the annexin positive cells came
down to 12.3%60.4% (p = 0.015). The results of annexin assay
were also validated with a positive control (data not shown). Our
findings show that the over expression of this miR-23a,27a,24-2
cluster induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells by caspase-dependent
as well as caspase-independent pathway.
Since mitochondria plays a major role in both the types of
apoptosis, we examined disruption in the mitochondrial mem￾brane potential (Dym) by DiOC6 and ROS production by
DCFH-DA in untransfected and p(23a,27a,24-2) transfected
HEK293T cells. As indicated in Fig. 2B in comparison to controls
where only 18.24% (p,0.002) of cells shifted towards left,
approximately 74.64% cells (p,0.04) shifted towards left in
miR-23a,27a,24-2 transfected HEK293T cells. Our results
indicate that over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster
induces significant disruption of Dym in HEK293T cells.
mCICCP was used as positive control for DiOC6 experiments.
The DCFH-DA assay (Fig. 2C) also shows that over expression
of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster increases ROS production as we
observed an increase in fluorescence intensity from 26.80%
(p,0.03) in untransfected HEK293T cells to 57.78% (p,0.02)
in miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster over expressed HEK293T cells.
p(23a,27a,24-2) modulates expression of proteins of
apoptotic pathways
In order to better understand the molecular basis of this cluster
induced apoptosis, we checked the expression of various proteins
involved in apoptosis before and after the over expression of this
cluster in HEK293T cells. Our western blot analysis (Fig. 3A)
showed 0.70 fold (p = 0.02) decrease in procaspase-3 level, 2.20
fold (p = 0.01) increase in cleaved caspase-3 level, 0.72 fold

(p,0.04) decrease in PARP protein (116 kD fragment), 0.60 fold
(p = 0.023) decrease in Bcl-2 level, 0.67 fold (p = 0.011) decrease in
Bax level, 3.98 fold (p = 0.014) increase in cleaved caspase-8 level,
0.59 fold decrease (p = 0.04) in uncleaved Bid level and 0.50 fold
decrease in FADD protein level (p = 0.02).
To further confirm that miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster induces
apoptosis by caspase-dependent pathway we did western blot
analysis for cytochrome-c. As shown in Fig. 3B, the cytochrome-c
levels in the cytosol increased by 3.42 fold (p = 0.03) after the over
expression of this cluster.
It is known that apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), perhaps the
best-studied example of a caspase- independent cell death (CICD)
mediator, is slowly released from mitochondria following mito￾chondrial outer membrane permeabilization in a caspase-inde￾pendent manner although caspase activity may accelerate the
release [38]. Following release, AIF translocates to the nucleus. To
confirm that the over expression of this cluster induces apoptosis by
caspase- independent pathway also, we next performed immuno￾staining to look for nuclear translocation of AIF (Apoptosis Inducing
Factor) and confocal imaging was used to determine the location of
AIF in HEK293T cells before and after cluster over expression. We
observed that AIF translocates from mitochondria to the nucleus
after the cluster over expression (Fig. 3C).
The results obtained here suggest that over expression of this
cluster induces FADD independent caspase-8 activation as there
was decrease of FADD in miR-23a,27a,24-2 transfected
HEK293T cells as compared to untransfected cells. Hence, it
was confirmed that over expression of this cluster induces
apoptosis by both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways.
FADD is a potential target of hsa-mir-27a
MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through decreased
translation, increased degradation of the target message, or both
[39]. Prediction of animal miRNA targets is challenging because
there is only a partial pairing of miRNAs with their targets, and
the mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation is poorly under￾stood. To improve the accuracy of binding site prediction, we used
three target prediction algorithms, miRanda [40], RNAhybrid
[41] and Target Scan [42]. Only those miR-target pairs predicted
by all the three softwares were used in the analysis. The transcript

(ENST00000301838) arising from the FADD gene was identified
as a target to hsa-miR-27a. We observed that there is perfect
complementarity between miR-27a and the 39UTR of FADD
over the seed region (2–9 bases of the mature miRNA). To
ascertain if miR-27a regulates FADD, we transfected HEK293T
cells with p(23a,27a,24-2) and did northern blot and western
blot analysis. Northern blot analysis confirmed increased expres￾sion of miR-27a following transfection (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
HEK293T cells transfected with p(23a,27a,24-2) showed
reduced FADD protein by western blot (Fig. 4B). Since we
observed dose-dependent increase of miR-27a by northern blot
and dose-dependent decrease of FADD by western blot, FADD
appeared to be a potential target of hsa-miR-27a.
To demonstrate that the negative effect of miR-27a on FADD
expression was direct, we cloned the entire wild type 39UTR of the
FADD gene into luciferase reporter vector and did luciferase
reporter assay. The luciferase activity assay at 24 h post
transfection demonstrated that miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster sup￾pressed luciferase reporter activity by 32% (Fig. 4C). To
demonstrate that this suppression in luciferase activity was the
effect of miR-27a and not the effect of other two miRNAs (miR￾23a and miR-24-2), we used anti-miRs at two different
concentrations (40 nM and 80 nM). Results in the Fig. 4C show
that suppression was relieved by anti-miR-27a but not by
anti-miR-23a and anti-miR-24,2. Thus, our data confirms that
miR-27a directly inhibits expression of FADD by binding to its
target sequence.
miRNA cluster augments the effect of TNF-a
As TNF-a is known to induce apoptosis via the extrinsic
pathway and the miRNA cluster (hsa-miR-23a,27a,24-2) also
induced apoptosis by down regulating FADD, we next investigated
whether over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster has any
effect on the sensitivity of HEK293T cells towards TNF-a.
Our annexin assay (Fig. 5A) showed that p(23a,27a,24-2) and
TNF-a by themselves induced 30%60.3% (p = 0.04) and
8.4%60.5% (p = 0.02) apoptosis, as compared to 37.3%60.2%
(p = 0.018) apoptosis when HEK293T cells were over expressed
with the cluster and treated with TNF-a (20 ng/ml) for 18 h. We
observed only 2.3% apoptosis in untransfected cells. We also
studied their combined effect on the mitochondrial membrane
potential (ym). Our DioC6 assay showed (Fig. 5B) that 72% cells
moved towards left when TNF-a treatment was given to cells after
over expression of the miRNA cluster as compared to 29% cells
which shifted towards left after TNF-a treatment in HEK293T
cells and 57% cells that moved towards left in HEK293T cells
after over expression with the miRNA cluster. Because receptor

2 (TRAF 2) and the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)
are important effectors of TNFR1 signaling, we examined whether
miR-23a,27a,24-2 over expression induces apoptosis through
TNFR1. Results in the Fig. 5C show that apart from reducing
FADD protein, over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster in
HEK293T cells was causing significant increase in TRAF2 protein
levels both in presence or absence of TNF-a. Our western blot
data also showed non significant changes in RIP protein levels
both in presence or absence of TNF-a.
In literature, it has been found that in RIP and TRAF-2
deficient cells, RIP is most likely responsible for NF-kB activation,
whereas TRAF-2 preferentially activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) [43]. Since, in our study we observed increased TRAF2 and no
change in RIP expression, we postulate that miR-23a,27a,24-2
cluster might be inducing apoptosis in HEK293T cells by activating
JNK and inhibiting NF-kB. To prove this, we did western blot
analysis for p-JNK and NF-kB. (Fig. 6A, C) and also checked for NF￾kB transcriptional activity using a reporter assay with pNF-kB-luc
plasmid (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, we observed activation of JNK and
inhibition of NF-kB in miR-23a,27a,24-2 transfected HEK293T
cells as compared to untransfected HEK293T cells. It seems that
miR-23a,27a,24-2 induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells via JNK
activation.
Discussion
The recent report by Gu et al [37] showed that upregulation
of miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster decreases transforming growth

factor-beta-induced tumor-suppressive activities in human hepa￾tocellular carcinoma cells. Contrary to their findings is our study
where for the first time it is shown that upregulation of miR￾23a,27a,24-2 cluster induces caspase-dependent and caspase￾independent apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cells. Consis￾tent to our findings there are reports in the literature where it has
been shown that the same microRNA can act as an oncogene
under one set of conditions and as a tumor suppressor in another
[18,36].
In this investigation, several observations suggest that miR-27a
regulates FADD expression. For example, over expression of miR￾23a,27a,24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells induces dose-dependent
increase of hsa-miR-27a and dose dependent decrease of FADD as
seen by northern and western analysis, respectively. This effect was
direct, as p(23a,27a,24-2) cluster negatively regulated the
expression of FADD 39 untranslated region (UTR)-based reporter
construct.
Our data shows that over expression of this cluster induces
down regulation of FADD and up regulation of caspase-8 thereby
showing that there is FADD-independent caspase-8 activation in
HEK293T cells. In regard to caspase-8 activation there are mixed
reports. Caspase-8 activation has been extensively studied in
apoptosis mediated by members of the death domain receptor
family such as Fas/CD95 and TNFR [44]. Interactions between
Fas and FADD via their C-terminal death domains expose the N￾terminal death effector domain (DED) of FADD, which can
interact with DED domains in the caspase-8 proform, resulting in
the oligomerization of this protease and its subsequent auto￾cleavage and activation [45–48]. Recent studies have also
suggested that alternative pathways may also be responsible for
caspase-8 activation. Indeed, it has been observed that TGF￾mediated caspase-8 activation in Burkitt cells does not involve
death domain receptors [49], and FADD-independent caspase-8
activation by anticancer drugs has also been reported by
Wesselborg et al [50].
The data here suggests that there are at least two different
pathways through which miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster induces
apoptosis in HEK293T cells: conventional caspase-dependent
apoptotic cell death and caspase-independent cell death. Both
occur via the mitochondrial membrane disruption pathway. Here,
we propose a model (Fig. 7) for miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster
induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. There is FADD-indepen￾dent caspase-8 activation which in turn is followed by cleavage of
Bid, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, release of apoptotic
proteins from mitochondria, and subsequent caspase-dependent
apoptosis. Our findings were confirmed by the upregulation of
active form of caspase 3, down regulation of 116 kD PARP

protein, Bcl-2, Bax and release of cytochrome-c from mitochon￾dria to cytosol after over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2
cluster in HEK293T cells. Rapid ROS generation might be
causing the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the
mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus, hence, leading to caspase
3-independent apoptosis by miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster in
HEK293T cells. There are several reports in the literature which
support this fact [51,52]. Further dissection of miR-23a,27a,24-
2 induced apoptosis shows that there was increased TRAF2
expression after miR-23a,27a,24-2 cluster over expression.
Literature suggests that trimerised TNFR1 can recruit proteins
that engage various signal transduction pathways, some of which
either abrogate or potentiate the apoptotic response [53] for
example, the serine threonine kinase RIP and TRAF-2. Studies
using RIP and TRAF-2 deficient cells indicate that RIP is most
likely responsible for NF-kB activation, whereas, TRAF-2
preferentially activates c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK) [43]. Since
in our study we observed increased TRAF-2 and decreased RIP
levels we can hypothesize that in HEK293T cells TRAF-2 plays a
major role in this cluster induced apoptosis. To prove this we did
western blot analysis and observed that there was increased JNK
activation as we observed increased p-JNK after miR￾23a,27a,24-2 cluster over expression in HEK293T cells. We
also did not observe any NF-kB activation and the NF-kB
expression was found to be decreased after over expression of this
cluster. In conclusion, we can say that over expression of miR￾23a,27a,24-2 cluster induces caspase-dependent and indepen￾dent apoptosis via JNK.
Our study extends the knowledge on FADD protein, a key
death receptor adaptor molecule. In addition to death receptor
ligand, FADD is also regulated at the transcriptional level by
microRNA. Absence of FADD protein expression is a marker for
tumor development and a prognostic factor for poor response to
chemotherapy in humans. FADD deficient tumor cells resist death
receptor-mediated apoptosis by chemotherapeutics drugs. Our
data demonstrating that over expression of miR-23a,27a,24-2
sensitized HEK293T cells to TNF-a cytotoxicity could potentially
be of value in cancer therapy.
