Abstract
OBJECTIVES To investigate the potential relation between
cumulative exposure to cigarette smoking in patients with or
without rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a positive family history of
the disease.
METHODS 239 outpatient based patients with RA were compared
with 239 controls matched for age, sex, and social class. A detailed
smoking history was recorded and expressed as pack years smoked.
Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the association
between RA and pack years smoked. The patients with RA were also


interviewed about a family history of disease and recorded as
positive if a first or second degree relative had RA. The smoking
history at the time of the study of the patients with RA with or
without a family history of the disease was compared directly with
that of their respective controls. Patients with RA with or without a
family history of the disease were also compared retrospectively for
current smoking at the time of disease onset.
RESULTS An increasing association between increased pack years
smoked and RA was found. There was a striking association
between heavy cigarette smoking and RA. A history for 41–50 pack
years smoked was associated with RA (odds ratio (OR) 13.54, 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) 2.89 to 63.38; p<0.001). The
association between ever having smoked and RA was modest (OR
1.81, CI 1.22 to 2.19; p=0.002). Furthermore, cigarette smoking in
the patients with RA without a positive family history of RA was
more prevalent than in the patients with a positive family history of
RA for ever having smoked (72% v 54%; p=0.006), the number of
pack years smoked (median 25.0v 4.0; p<0.001), and for smoking
at the time of disease onset (58% v 39%; p=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS Heavy cigarette smoking, but not smoking itself, is
strongly associated with RA requiring hospital follow up and is
markedly more prevalent in patients with RA without a family
history of RA.
