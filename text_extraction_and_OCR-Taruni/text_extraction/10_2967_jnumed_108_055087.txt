Because 18F-FDG PET has insufficient sensitivity for the detec￾tion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 11C-acetate PET has
been proposed as another technique for this use. We prospec￾tively evaluated the value of PET/CT using these 2 tracers for
the detection of primary and metastatic HCC. Methods: One
hundred twelve patients (99 with HCC, 13 with cholangiocellular
carcinoma) underwent biopsy and 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate
PET/CT. Results: The overall sensitivities of 18F-FDG, 11C-acetate,
and dual-tracer PET/CT in the detection of 110 lesions in
90 patients with primary HCC were 60.9%, 75.4%, and 82.7%,
respectively. Elevated serum a-fetoprotein levels, an advanced
tumor stage, portal vein tumor thrombosis, large tumors, and
multiple tumors were significantly associated with positive
18F-FDG PET/CT results. Uptake of 11C-acetate was associated
with large and multiple tumors. For 18F-FDG, the sensitivities
according to tumor size (1–2, 2–5, and $5 cm) were 27.2%,
47.8%, and 92.8%, respectively; for 11C-acetate, these respec￾tive values were 31.8%, 78.2%, and 95.2%. 18F-FDG was more
sensitive in the detection of poorly differentiated HCC. Overall
survival was lower in patients with 18F-FDG PET/CT positive for
all indexed lesions than in those with FDG negative or partially
positive through the entire follow-up period. In analysis based
on biopsied lesions, the sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/CT was
64.4% for primary HCC and 84.4% for 11C-acetate PET/CT.
The overall sensitivities of 18F-FDG, 11C-acetate, and dual-tracer
PET/CT for 35 metastatic HCCs were 85.7%, 77.0%, and 85.7%,
respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity
of tracers according to metastatic tumor size, location, or differ￾entiation. Conclusion: The addition of 11C-acetate to 18F-FDG
PET/CT increases the overall sensitivity for the detection of pri￾mary HCC but not for the detection of extrahepatic metastases.
18F-FDG, 11C-acetate, and dual-tracer PET/CT have a low sensi￾tivity for the detection of small primary HCC, but 18F-FDG PET/CT
has a relatively high sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic
metastases of HCC.

The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is related to tumor stage at presentation and under￾lying liver function. Reliable staging of HCC is a funda￾mental precondition for deciding on the treatment modality,
and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging
system links tumor stage with treatment modality (1). In
particular, accurate characterization of primary and meta￾static HCC, showing the tendency toward early vascular
invasion of the tumor (2), is critical for proper treatment
(2). Imaging studies by dynamic CT and contrast-enhanced
MRI are important in the diagnosis and staging of HCC
(1,3,4), but there is no consensus on which imaging tests
are proper for detecting extrahepatic metastases. Whole￾body PET has been used in a portion of HCC patients, but
its usefulness has not yet been established.
Because whole-body combined PET/CT using 18F-FDG
effectively detects numerous cancerous lesions (5), this
method was expected to improve the accuracy of HCC
staging. However, the high level of glucose-6-phosphatase
in liver tissue leads to the release of FDG-6-phosphate,
resulting in reduced accumulation in differentiated HCCs
(6). Thus, 18F-FDG PET has an average false-negative rate
of 40%250% for the detection of HCC (7), and data on the
role of PET/CT in the detection of HCC metastasis are
limited (7–9). 11C-labeled acetate PET effectively detects urologic
malignancies (10). This tracer enters the Krebs cycle as a
substrate for b-oxidation in fatty acid synthesis and cho￾lesterol synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is believed to be the
major reason for uptake of 11C-acetate by liver tumors.
Recently, a Chinese study reported that 11C-acetate PET

has improved sensitivity for detection of well-differentiated
HCCs and that none of the primary HCC lesions was
negative for 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate tracers (6). However,
that study did not analyze sensitivity with regard to clinical
and tumor characteristics, including underlying liver func￾tion and tumor stage. PET/CT is used mainly to screen for
tumor metastasis, and its use is increasing because of an
increasing number of candidates for curative treatment such
as liver transplantation. Previous studies of PET/CT in
patients with primary and metastatic HCC enrolled few
patients or were retrospective (7–9,11,12).
The aim of this prospective study was to validate the
value of 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT for the detection
of primary and metastatic HCC in 112 patients admitted to
our center for diagnosis and treatment of primary liver
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between June 2006 and April 2007, 112 patients diagnosed
with primary liver cancer at the National Cancer Center Hospital
(Goyang, South Korea) were prospectively enrolled. All patients
gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the Internal
Review Board at the hospital. All patients had newly diagnosed
HCC, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), or a newly diagnosed
distant metastasis after curative resection of HCC that was
performed 6 mo before this study. Patients underwent 18F-FDG
and 11C-acetate PET/CT free of charge before treatment. Clinical
diagnosis of primary HCC was based on the guidelines of the
Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and the National Cancer Center
of Korea (13). CCC was diagnosed by pathologic examination and
exclusion of other metastatic adenocarcinomas. All 112 patients
were examined by spiral CT, and imaging was confirmed patho￾logically by liver biopsy or operative tumor resection that was
performed 1 wk before or after PET/CT. Liver biopsy was per￾formed on a typical index lesion. The inclusion criteria of subjects
were as follows: age between 18 and 80 y, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, adequate liver func￾tion (Child–Pugh classification A or B), and adequate renal function
(serum creatinine , 1.4 mg/dL). Patients were excluded if they had
any other malignancy, a concurrent nonmalignant severe illness, or
a psychiatric disorder.
Metastatic HCC lesions were screened and followed by chest
radiography and routine spiral liver CT that covered the area from
the hila of the lungs through the symphysis pubis or (in the case of
suspected positive symptoms) by additional bone scanning and
brain MRI. HCC metastasis was confirmed by histopathologic
diagnosis (in the case of tumor resection or biopsy), by follow-up
chest spiral CT with compatible nodules (when there was no
clinical evidence of a benign tumor or inflammation), or by bone
MRI or bone CT. Intraabdominal metastases and brain metastases
were diagnosed by routine spiral liver CT and brain MRI. An
intraabdominal lymph node metastasis was considered to be
present when the node was more than 1 cm in diameter.
The absence of HCC metastasis was confirmed by the serum
level of a-fetoprotein and by imaging (chest radiography and
routine spiral liver CT covering the area from the hila of the lungs
through the symphysis pubis) performed at the 3-mo follow-up.
Imaging Studies and Biopsy
Routine spiral CT was performed with multidetector CT scan￾ners (Lightspeed pro-16; GE Healthcare). Images were acquired
in a craniocaudal direction from the hila of the lungs through
the symphysis pubis with 1.25 · 16 mm beam collimation and a
reconstruction interval of 3.0 mm. Hepatic artery–phase imaging
was initiated 25 s after contrast medium injection. After admin￾istration of the contrast medium, the portal vein phase and
equilibrium phase were acquired at 70 and 180 s, respectively.
MRI was performed on a 1.5-T superconducting scanner
(Sigma; GE Healthcare) with a torso coil for signal reception.
Baseline MRI was performed, and dynamic imaging was performed
before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine
(Magnevist; Schering). Superparamagnetic iron oxide–enhanced
MRI was performed immediately after gadolinium-enhanced dy￾namic MRI. For superparamagnetic iron oxide–enhanced MRI,
ferumoxides (Feridex I.V.; Advanced Magnetics) were adminis￾tered and images were obtained at 30 s (hepatic artery phase),
70 s (portal vein phase), and 3–5 min (delayed phase). Spiral
CT and contrast-enhanced MRI were evaluated by 2 expert
radiologists.
Sonographically guided percutaneous core biopsies were per￾formed using a freehand technique. All biopsies were performed
with a 3.5- to 5-MHz convex probe (Acuson Sequia 512; Siemens
Medical Solutions) with 18-gauge automated core biopsy needles
(Acecut; TSK). Specimens were routinely processed and were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by the Masson trichrome
method. HCC was diagnosed according to the criteria of the
International Working Party (14).
18F-FDG and 11C-Acetate PET/CT 11C-acetate was synthesized using a fully automated custom￾made radiochemistry module based on the solid-phase extraction
method of Roeda et al. (15). 18F-FDG was synthesized at our
hospital using an automated radiochemistry module (Chemical
Process Control Unit; CTI/Siemens).
PET studies were performed with a dedicated PET scanner
(Biograph LSO; Siemens Medical Systems) or a PET/CT scan￾ner (Discovery LS; GE Healthcare). For the Biograph LSO
scanner, we used a scout view with 30 mA and 130 kVp,
followed by a spiral CT scan with an effective milliamperage of
50, 130 kVp, a 5-mm section width, a 4-mm collimation, a 12-
mm table feed per rotation, 0.8 s per rotation, and the patient’s
arms raised. For the Discovery LS scanner, we used a scout view
with 30 mA and 120 kVp, followed by a spiral CT scan with a
0.8-s rotation time, 80 mA, 140 kVp, a 5-mm section thickness, a
4.25-mm interval in high-speed mode, and the patient’s arms at
the sides of the torso. PET images were acquired after CT scans
at 3 min per bed position of 11.2 cm in the 3-dimensional
acquisition mode (Biograph LSO) or 4 min per bed position of
14.2 cm in the 2-dimensional acquisition mode (Discovery LS).
CT images were reconstructed onto a 512 · 512 matrix and
converted into 511-keV-equivalent attenuation factors for atten￾uation correction. PET images were reconstructed onto a 128 ·
128 matrix using ordered-subsets expectation maximization and
attenuation correction. The standardized uptake value (SUV) was
calculated as (decay-corrected activity [kBq] per milliliter of
tissue volume)/(injected 18F-FDG activity [kBq]/body mass [g]).
The SUVs of lesions were obtained by placing regions of interest
manually around the lesion. The maximum SUV within a region
of interest was used to minimize partial-volume effects.

All patients were normoglycemic and had fasted, except for
water and medications, for at least 8 h before the PET studies.
11C-acetate PET/CT was performed first, and 18F-FDG PET/CT
was performed at least 4 h later. 11C-Acetate PET/CT. Whole-body static PET/CT scans, ob￾tained 20 min after intravenous injection of about 370–555 MBq
(10–15 mCi) of 11C-acetate, were acquired from the cerebellum to
the upper third of the femur with 6–7 frames. To enhance and
standardize tumor uptake of 18F-FDG, we had the patients con￾tinue to fast after 11C-acetate PET/CT until the end of the 18F￾FDG PET/CT study. 18F-FDG PET/CT. The patients were kept well hydrated
because 18F-FDG is excreted through the kidney and urinary
bladder. Twenty milligrams of furosemide were administered
intravenously within 10 min of the 18F-FDG injection, and then
500 mL of water were given. 18F-FDG (444–740 MBq [12–20
mCi]) was injected intravenously 4 h after 11C-acetate PET/CT.
Patients were encouraged to rest during the 18F-FDG uptake
period. Sixty minutes after 18F-FDG injection, whole-body static
PET/CT was performed using the same method as for whole-body
11C-acetate PET/CT.
PET/CT Analysis
Separate CT and PET scan data were accurately coregistered.
PET, PET/CT, and CT images were reviewed using a dedicated
workstation and software (eNtegra; GE Healthcare, and e.Soft;
Siemens Medical Solutions). With this system, 3-dimensional
displays (transaxial, coronal, and sagittal) were available, as were
maximum-intensity projections of the PET data. PET/CT scans
were interpreted by 2 nuclear medicine physicians, who were
unaware of the results of other imaging studies on these patients.
Intrahepatic primary lesions were interpreted visually using a
3-point grading system (isometabolic, hypermetabolic, and hypo￾metabolic) that compared data with tracer uptake by normal liver
parenchyma for 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG PET. If a lesion was
hypermetabolic on at least 1 image from 11C-acetate or 18F-FDG
PET, it was assumed to be a malignant hepatic mass. Extrahepatic
lesions were interpreted visually using a 5-point scale: 0, no
visible accumulation; 1, less accumulation than in the liver; 2,
accumulation about the same as in the liver; 3, more accumulation
than in the liver but less than in the brain cortex; 4, accumulation
comparable to that of the brain cortex (16). An extrahepatic lesion
was considered to be malignant when its accumulation of 18F￾FDG or 11C-acetate was over 3 on this scale.
Interpretation and Statistical Analysis
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate
PET/CT, we calculated values in a lesion-to-lesion analysis for
all primary liver cancer lesions, lymph nodes, and distant meta￾stases. All analyzed lesions were larger than 1 cm and were
interpreted according to the criteria described above for spiral
CT or contrast-enhanced MRI. Patient-based analysis was also
performed. For the subgroup of patients with more than 4 lesions
or with diffuse infiltrative tumors, the index lesion was assigned
as the representative lesion or area before PET/CT analysis.
Liver biopsy sites were identified if biopsies were performed
before PET/CT analysis.
The data were analyzed using STATA software, version 9.1
(StataCorp LP). The Pearson x2 test and Fisher exact test were
used for categoric variables, and the Student t test was used for
continuous variables. The results of all continuous variables are
expressed as the mean 6 SD. The Kaplan–Meier method was used
to estimate overall survival curves, and survival curves were
compared using the log-rank test. Results were considered signif￾icant if the P value was less than 0.05.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of the 112 patients (99 with HCC, 13
with CCC) are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was
57.6 6 10.4 y (range, 34–85 y), and the sex ratio (M:F) was
3.7:1. Eighty-three patients (74.1%) tested positive for the
hepatitis B surface antigen. Ten patients had hepatitis C, 10
had a history of alcohol abuse, and 10 had non-B/non-C/
nonalcoholic etiologies. One hundred one patients had a
Child–Pugh classification of A. Nine patients who under￾went surgical resection had distant metastases but no
primary liver lesions; hence we analyzed 90 patients for
primary tumor characteristics. Analysis of the maximal
diameter of tumors showed that 7 patients (7.8%) had
lesions 1–2 cm in diameter, 42 patients (46.7%) had lesions
2–5 cm in diameter, and 41 patients (45.5%) had lesions
5 cm or more in diameter. Analysis of the number of nodules
showed that 46 patients (51.1%) had 1 nodule, 11 patients
(12.2%) had 2 nodules, 3 patients (3.3%) had 3 nodules,
and 30 patients (33.3%) had more than 3 nodules. Of the 99
HCC patients, 7 had biopsy specimens that were inadequate
for evaluation of tumor differentiation. We evaluated the
other 92 patients (83 with primary HCC, 9 with metastatic
HCC) using the Edmonson–Steiner grading system. Nine
patients were grade I, 51 were grade II, 29 were grade III,
and 3 were grade IV. Serum a-fetoprotein levels less than
20 ng/mL were detected in 43 HCC patients (43.4%). Using
the modified Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (Inter￾national Union Against Cancer) (UICC) staging system, we
enrolled 5 (5.1%) stage I patients, 37 (37.3%) stage II
patients, 16 (16.2%) stage III patients, 13 (13.1%) stage IVa
patients, and 28 (28.3%) stage IVb patients. According to
the BCLC staging system, 21 patients (21.4%) were in very
early or early stage HCC, 35 patients (35.7%) were in
intermediate stage HCC, and 43 patients (44%) in advanced
or terminal stage HCC (Table 1).
Lesion Uptake of PET/CT: Patient-Based Analysis
Among the 99 HCC patients, we evaluated all positive
results from 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT (Tables 2
and 3; Fig. 1). Because the number of index lesions varied
from 1 to 4 in each patient, we classified analysis of PET
positives in all lesions and partial lesions. In our patient-based
analysis, a PET-positive result indicates a positive result
for all index lesions. The following factors were signifi￾cantly associated with uptake of 18F-FDG findings on PET/
CT: level of serum a-fetoprotein, modified UICC stage,
BCLC stage, tumor size, number of tumors, and presence of
portal vein invasion. Higher levels of serum a-fetoprotein
1914 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE • Vol. 49 • No. 12 • December 2008

and larger tumors were associated with positive 18F-FDG
PET/CT results (P , 0.001). None of the 7 patients with
small tumors (,2 cm in diameter), 18 of 42 patients (43%)
with tumors 2–5 cm in diameter, and 32 of 41 patients
(78%) with tumors larger than 5 cm had positive findings
for all index lesions on 18F-FDG PET/CT. However, the
differences between these groups were not statistically
significant (Table 3). None of the patients in modified
UICC stage I and none of the patients in the very early
BCLC stage had positive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT. In
contrast, 11 of 13 patients (85%) in modified UICC stage
IVa and 31 of 42 patients (74%) in the advanced BCLC
stage had positive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT. Figure 2
shows the association between 18F-FDG PET/CT and
overall survival in HCC patients. Patients with positive
18F-FDG PET/CT findings for all indexed lesions had signif￾icantly lower survival than did patients with negative or
partially positive 18F-FDG PET/CT findings (P 5 0.0421).
The significant factors for uptake of 11C-acetate were
tumor size and number of tumors (Tables 2 and 3). Any
clinical factors and staging were not associated with uptake
of 11C-acetate PET/CT. In contrast to our 18F-FDG PET/CT
results, in 2 of 5 patients (40%) in modified UICC stage I
and 31 of 37 patients (84%) in modified UICC stage II, all
lesions were positive on 11C-acetate PET/CT. In 2 of 7
patients (29%) with small tumors (diameter , 2 cm) and 29
of 42 patients (69%) with 2- to 5-cm tumors, all lesions
were positive on 11C-acetate PET/CT (P 5 0.003; Table 3).
Compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, 11C-acetate PET/CT
showed positive findings for all lesions in more patients
with the following characteristics: the male sex, a perfor￾mance status of 0, a serum a-fetoprotein level of less than
20 ng/mL, hepatitis B virus positive, modified UICC stage
II, an intermediate-sized (2–5 cm) tumor, a single tumor, a
well-defined tumor, and no portal vein invasion (P , 0.05).
The positivity of 11C-acetate PET/CT was not related to the
survival of HCC patients (P 5 0.7271).
Sensitivity for Detection of Primary Liver Cancer by PET/
CT: Lesion-Based Analysis
Among the 110 lesions of the 90 patients with primary
HCC, we evaluated the lesions that were positive on
18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT (Table 4; Fig. 3). Tumor
size, number of tumors, and tumor differentiation were
significantly associated with the sensitivity for detection of
primary HCC on 18F-FDG PET/CT (P , 0.05). The
sensitivity for detection of HCC by 18F-FDG PET/CT was
27.2%, 47.8%, and 92.8% in index lesions sized 1–2 cm,
2–5 cm, and 5 cm or more, respectively. Twenty-seven of
46 single lesions (58.8%) and 26 of 33 index lesions (79%)
in patients who had more than 3 lesions were positive on
18F-FDG PET/CT. 18F-FDG PET/CT had significantly higher
sensitivity for poorly differentiated HCC (Edmonson–Steiner
grades III and IV) than for well-differentiated HCC (grades I
and II; P , 0.001).

PROSPECTIVE EVALUATION OF PET/CT IN HCC • Park et al. 1915

The sensitivity of 11C-acetate PET/CT for the detection
of primary HCC was significantly associated with tumor
size and number of tumors (Table 4). The sensitivity for
detection of primary HCC on 11C-acetate PET/CT was
31.8%, 78.2%, and 95.2% in index lesions sized 1–2 cm,
2–5 cm, and 5 cm or more, respectively. Larger tumors
were associated with significantly greater sensitivity (P ,
0.001). Thirty-seven of 46 single lesions (80.4%) and 28 of
33 index lesions in patients with multiple lesions (84.8%)
were positive for 11C-acetate uptake on PET/CT. Compar￾ison of the 2 PET modalities indicates that 11C-acetate
PET/CT had significantly higher sensitivity for detection of
medium-sized tumors (2–5 cm), single tumors, and well￾differentiated tumors (P , 0.05). The statistics for the
maximum SUV of the 110 index lesions are summarized in
Table 5.
For detection of the 110 index lesions in patients with
primary HCC, the sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/CT was
60.9%, the sensitivity of 11C-acetate PET/CT was 75.4%,
and the sensitivity of dual tracers was 82.7%. Among the
90 HCC lesions that underwent biopsy, 18F-FDG PET/CT
detected 58 lesions (a sensitivity of 64.4%) and 11C-acetate
PET/CT detected 76 lesions (a sensitivity of 84.4%). Of the
13 CCC lesions that underwent biopsy, all were positive by
18F-FDG PET/CT (a sensitivity of 100%) and 9 were
positive by 11C-acetate PET/CT (a sensitivity of 69.2%).

Sensitivity for Detection of Metastatic HCC by PET/CT
For the 28 patients with modified UICC stage IVb HCC,
patient-based analysis indicated that 19 (68%) were posi￾tive for 18F-FDG and 18 (64%) were positive for 11C￾acetate. In this analysis, ‘‘positive’’ indicated positive for all
index lesions and metastases in each patient (Table 2).
For lesion-based analysis, we evaluated the sensitivity of
PET/CT in the detection of 35 metastatic HCC index
lesions in 28 patients (Table 6). The locations of distant
metastases were lung (20 lesions), bone (6 lesions), adrenal
gland (4 lesions), abdominal peritoneum (3 lesions), brain
(1 lesion), and left atrium of the heart (1 lesion). The
overall sensitivity of 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT in
FIGURE 2. Overall survival after diagnosis of HCC. Kaplan–
Meier survival plots are classified by positivity of 18F-FDG. Overall
survival was lower in patients with positive 18F-FDG findings than
in those with negative or partially positive 18F-FDG findings
through entire follow-up period. P values were calculated using
log-rank test.

35 index lesions of 28 patients with metastatic HCC was
85.7%, 77.0%, and 85.7% by 18F-FDG alone, 11C-acetate
alone, and both tracers, respectively. All positive lesions
detected by 11C-acetate (Fig. 4) were also positive on 18F￾FDG PET/CT. Additionally, 5 index lesions of the lymph
node metastases 1 cm or larger were evaluated, 3 of which
were positive on 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT.
Of 20 small metastatic lesions (1–2 cm in diameter), 16
(80%) were detected on 18F-FDG PET/CT and 13 (65%) on 11C-acetate PET/CT. The sensitivity of both PET/CT
tracers in the 15 metastatic lesions 2 cm or larger was the
same: 93%. 18F-FDG PET/CT detected 100% of HCC

metastases in bone (6 cases) and the abdominal peritoneum
(3 cases). 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-acetate PET/CT
detected 80% and 70% of lung metastases, respectively.
Tumor differentiation did not show any significant differ￾ences in positive findings between the 2 modalities (90%
vs. 90.9% in grades I and II and 76.9% vs. 53.8% in grades
III and IV). In a comparison with poorly differentiated
HCC, metastatic tumors from well-differentiated HCC had
a greater number of positive results with 11C-acetate (P 5
0.032). There was no significant difference between the 2
tracers in sensitivity for metastatic tumor size, location, or
differentiation (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
PET/CT is used in HCC patients to detect extrahepatic
metastases (11,17), predict outcome after resection (18,19),
select liver transplantation candidates (20), and assess
residual tumors after treatment with transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation (21). The
usefulness of these applications depends on the ability of
PET/CT to detect small or atypical lesions—those for
which no diagnostic studies with spiral CT or contrast￾enhanced MRI are available, those in the liver, and those in
extrahepatic areas. Previous studies, which enrolled few
patients or were retrospective, reported inadequate sensi￾tivity for 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of primary
HCC (22–26) and suggested the addition of 11C-acetate
PET/CT to improve the accuracy of PET/CT (6). However,
these studies did not provide sufficient clinical detail for
hepatologists and oncologists, the primary users of PET/CT
for liver tumors.
In this study, the overall sensitivity for the detection of
primary HCC was 60.9% for 18F-FDG alone, 75.4% for 11C-acetate alone, and 82.7% for both tracers. Although
dual-tracer PET/CT had better sensitivity, the results of
tumor size–based analysis were disappointing. For 1- to
2-cm HCCs, the sensitivity was 27.2% with 18F-FDG PET/

CT and 31.8% with 11C-acetate PET/CT. Patient-based
analysis indicated that none of the 5 patients with stage I
HCC (modified UICC system) or very early stage HCC
(BCLC system) had positive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT
(Table 2). Therefore, 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT
appear not to be useful for the detection of small lesions in
the liver. The morphologic distinction of small HCC tumors
from other regenerative nodules and premalignant dysplas￾tic nodules can be difficult. Several PET/CT studies have
suggested that differentiation of these nodules is possible,
but our results do not support this conclusion. Biopsy￾based analysis indicated that the sensitivity was 64.4%
by 18F-FDG PET/CT and 84.4% by 11C-acetate PET/CT,
apparently better than the overall sensitivity. However, we
cannot exclude selection bias such as selection of a larger
tumor for biopsy as an indexed lesion. Comparison with
other benign tumors is not reasonable in clinical settings,
and we therefore designed this study for only HCC and
CCC patients. This study design (99 HCC patients, 13 CCC
patients), therefore, could be considered as a case-only
design, allowing computation of only the test sensitivity.
All 13 cases of CCC had positive findings on 18F-FDG
PET/CT. Although a previous study reported that 11C￾acetate did not accumulate in CCC (6), the number of
patients in this study was only 3, and 9 of our 13 CCC
patients had positive findings on 11C-acetete PET/CT.
Further study of the accuracy of 11C-acetate PET/CT in
CCC may be required.
We found that both tracers were more readily taken up
when there were large tumors or a large number of tumors.
Our patient-based analysis indicated that clinical factors
(age, sex, etiology, performance, Child–Pugh class) did not
affect tracer uptake. Serum a-fetoprotein level and tumor
stage (by the modified UICC and the BCLC systems)
affected uptake only of 18F-FDG. For analyzing accuracy
in the detection of small tumors or extrahepatic metastases,
we prospectively enrolled more patients who had modified
UICC stage I, II, and IVb, compared with the patient
population of our previous report (27). A high rate of
positive findings on 18F-FDG PET has been reported in
patients with elevated serum a-fetoprotein levels (7) and in
patients with poorly differentiated HCC (28).
Our study also showed a high positive rate for both
18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-acetate PET/CT in poorly differ￾entiated HCC. 11C-acetate accumulation was significantly
better than 18F-FDG accumulation in well-differentiated
HCC (50% vs. 71.4%), but there was no difference between
the tracers in poorly differentiated HCC (Table 4). These
results differ from those of a previous report (6), possibly
because we used a different protocol for classifying tumor
differentiation (2 categories in this study). However, in
comparing the 2 tracers, 11C-acetate PET/CT yielded better
results in male patients, in patients with better performance
status, and in hepatitis B virus–positive patients. These
results could be related to the biologic characteristics of
the tumors and requires further study. A previous study
reported that the 2-y recurrence-free survival rate of 18F-FDG
PET/CT–negative HCC patients was significantly higher than
that of 18F-FDG–positive HCC patients after liver trans￾plantation (20). In this study, patients with positive 18F-FDG
PET/CT findings for all indexed lesions had a significantly
lower survival rate (Fig. 2). Because uptake of 18F-FDG
PET/CT was associated with the level of serum a-fetoprotein,
modified UICC stage, BCLC stage, tumor size, number of
tumors, and presence or absence of portal vein invasion,
multivariate analysis did not reveal positive 18F-FDG findings
to be an independent risk factor for survival.
18F-FDG PET/CT might be useful in the evaluation of
extrahepatic metastases, although data supporting this pos￾sibility are limited (7–9,11,12). To our knowledge, our
study is the first that has prospectively evaluated the
sensitivity of dual-tracer PET/CT for the detection of
HCC metastases. Our patient-based analysis indicated that
only 68% of stage IVb HCC patients (modified UICC
system) had positive 18F-FDG findings for all lesions,
including primary and metastatic HCC (Table 2). The
finding of no 18F-FDG uptake by primary HCC lesions
decreased the positive rate in this patient-based analysis.
However, our lesion-based analysis of 35 indexed extrahe￾patic metastases indicated that 18F-FDG PET/CT detected
80% of lung metastases and 100% of bone metastases
(Table 6). Lung and bone are the 2 major sites of HCC
metastases. A metastatic tumor diameter greater than 1 cm
had no effect on the sensitivity of detection by either tracer,
and well-differentiated tumors were more likely to test
positive with 11C-acetate. In contrast to detection of pri￾mary 1- to 2-cm HCCs, 18F-FDG PET/CT was more
sensitive than 11C-acetate PET/CT for detecting metastases,
although this difference was not statistically significant
(Table 6). For metastatic HCC, dual-tracer PET/CT was not
superior to 18F-FDG alone. A previous comparison of bone
scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT reported that PET/CT
was more sensitive, but that study provided no data about
HCC (29). Evaluating the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT
for screening extrahepatic HCC metastases requires a
further cost–benefit study.
Our study had some limitations. Histopathologic confir￾mation of metastases (the gold standard) was not possible
in all cases. In our prospective study, we screened for
metastatic HCC lesions and followed up with imaging
studies or additional methods. The absence of HCC metas￾tasis was confirmed by the level of serum a-fetoprotein and
by imaging (chest radiography and routine spiral liver CT
covering from the hila of the lungs through the symphysis
pubis) performed at the 3-mo follow-up. The criteria we
used to determine metastasis may have resulted in some
underestimation, even though the study was prospective.
Lymph node metastasis is not rare in advanced HCC (30),
but confirmation of metastases to lymph nodes smaller than
1 cm in diameter is not possible through an imaging study.
Moreover, previous transarterial chemoembolization, hep￾atitis, endoscopic procedures on varices, and peritonitis, all
1920 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE • Vol. 49 • No. 12 • December 2008

of which are common in HCC patients, can increase lymph
node size. In our study, 3 of 5 index lesions of lymph nodes
greater than 1 cm in diameter tested positive on both 18F￾FDG PET/CT and 11C-acetate PET/CT (data not shown).
In summary, this study prospectively investigated the
value of 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT in the detection
of primary and metastatic HCC. The addition of 11C-acetate
to 18F-FDG PET/CT increases overall sensitivity in the
detection of primary HCC but not of extrahepatic metas￾tases. 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-acetate PET/CT have a
low sensitivity in the detection of small primary HCCs, but
18F-FDG PET/CT has a comparatively high sensitivity in
the detection of extrahepatic metastases. These results
suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-acetate PET/CT
appear not to be useful for the detection of small primary
HCC but that 18F-FDG PET/CT may be useful for the
screening of extrahepatic metastases of HCC.
