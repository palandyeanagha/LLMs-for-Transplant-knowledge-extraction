Abstract
Microbiota have been shown to have a great influence on functions of intestinal epithelial cells (ECs). The role of indole as a
quorum-sensing (QS) molecule mediating intercellular signals in bacteria has been well appreciated. However, it remains
unknown whether indole has beneficial effects on maintaining intestinal barriers in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the effect
of indole on ECs using a germ free (GF) mouse model. GF mice showed decreased expression of junctional complex
molecules in colonic ECs. The feces of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice contained a high amount of indole; however the
amount was significantly decreased in the feces of GF mice by 27-fold. Oral administration of indole-containing capsules
resulted in increased expression of both tight junction (TJ)- and adherens junction (AJ)-associated molecules in colonic ECs
in GF mice. In accordance with the increased expression of these junctional complex molecules, GF mice given indole￾containing capsules showed higher resistance to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. A similar protective effect of
indole on DSS-induced epithelial damage was also observed in mice bred in SPF conditions. These findings highlight the
beneficial role of indole in establishing an epithelial barrier in vivo.

Introduction
The human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microor￾ganisms, called commensal gut microbiota. Commensal microbi￾ota establish a symbiotic relationship with their host, to maintain
homeostasis of the gut environment. For example, gut commensal
microbiota support host metabolism by producing energy and
nutrients from the diet [1–3]. Furthermore, recent reports
demonstrate that gut microbiota influence not only metabolic
processes but also the development of the host immune system and
the maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier [4,5].
Various mechanisms by which gut microbiota modulate
epithelial functions were recently reported [6,7]. Gut microbiota
can influence the functions of epithelial cells (ECs) either through
the direct contact with ECs, or indirectly through mediating the
production of dietary metabolites. The direct recognition of
microbiota by ECs is mainly mediated by Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), which comprise a family of pattern recognition receptors.
TLR2 promotes the assembly of intestinal epithelial tight junction
(TJ)-associated molecules via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
and protein kinase B (Akt) pathway [8]. TLR4 regulates
proliferation and apoptosis of ECs [9]. Indirect effect by
microbiota can occur through a variety of mechanisms. For
example, acetic acid produced by a certain bifidobacterial strain,
one of the major bacterial species in probiotics, was recently shown
to promote the defense function of host ECs against enterohemor￾rhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) by inducing genes related to anti￾inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of ECs [10]. Short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) fermented by intestinal microbiota were also
reported to activate G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR41
and GPR43 expressed in ECs, leading to inflammatory cytokine
production [11]. Thus, microbiota directly or indirectly affect
epithelial barrier functions by modulating various pathways in
ECs.
Just as mammalian cells use a variety of cytokines and hormones
to communicate with each other, microbes also utilize specific
molecules for transducing certain signals to others, which are
called quorum-sensing (QS) molecules. Acyl-homoserine lactones
(AHLs) are one of the best-characterized classes of molecules
involved in this process [12]. The effects of AHLs on bacterial cells
include toxin expression, regulation of virulence, and cell growth.
A previous report showed that gut commensal microbes also utilize
this QS system for communication [13]. More importantly, some
of these QS molecules were recently shown to modulate immune
responses in the host. The Pseudomonas sp. QS molecule, 3-
oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) induced
apoptosis of macrophages and neutrophils [14]. Thus, certain
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80604

bacterial QS molecules mediate communication between bacteria
and their host [15,16].
Indole is produced by a variety of both gram-positive and gram￾negative bacteria possessing tryptophanase, a bacteria-specific
enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan. Indole has been shown to act
as a QS molecule that mediates intercellular signals in bacteria
[17]. A recent study indicated that indole enhances barrier
functions of ECs in vitro by inducing the expression of several genes
involved in EC functions [18]. These genes included those
responsible for TJs, adherens junctions (AJ), actin cytoskeleton
and mucin production, indicating the role of indole in strength￾ening the epithelial barrier. However, it remains unknown
whether indole has beneficial effects on maintaining the intestinal
barrier in vivo.
In this study, we showed that colonic ECs expressed decreased
level of TJ- and AJ-associated molecules in GF mice. Compared to
the feces of SPF mice, the feces of GF mice contained significantly
less amount of indole. Oral administration of indole-containing
capsules resulted in enhanced expression of both TJ- and AJ￾associated molecules in colonic ECs of GF mice. Furthermore,
beneficial effects of indole against DSS-mediated epithelial insult
were observed not only in GF mice but in SPF mice. These results
suggest that indole produced by gut commensal microbiota plays
an essential role in enhancing epithelial barrier functions in the
colon.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Indole was purchased from Sigma, and 3-indoxyl sulfate
potassium salt was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylfor￾mamide (DMF) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque. Indole was
dissolved in medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and seamless
microcapsules containing either indole or MCT were prepared at
Morishita Jintan. Anti-occludin rabbit polyclonal IgG was
purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-E-cadherin mouse polyclonal
IgG was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Alexa
Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 568-
conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Life Technol￾ogies. 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from
Wako.
Mice
ICR and IQI mice were purchased from CLEA Japan. ICR
mice are a well-appreciated outbred strain used as SPF mice,
whereas IQI mice are GF mice developed from the ICR strain in
Japan. IQI mice were bred and maintained in vinyl isolators under
GF conditions. For the administration of indole or MCT, mice
were given indole- or MCT- containing seamless microcapsules
(approximately 15 mg) once daily for 2 weeks by oral catheters.
Fifteen mg of microcapsules contained 0.369 mg of indole. All
animal experiments were performed following our institutional
guidelines.
Sample preparation for HPLC analysis
After feces were collected into microtubes, a 10-fold volume of
methanol was added and the feces were homogenized. Two
hundred microliters of the suspension was transferred to a new
tube, and 200 mL of methanol was added. The mixture was then
incubated at 220uC for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20,0006 g for
15 min at 4uC. Subsequently, 150 mL of the supernatant was
collected and 150 mL of distilled water was added. The solution
was centrifuged at 20,0006 g for 15 min at 4uC and the
supernatant was applied to HPLC analysis.
HPLC analysis for indole
HPLC analyses were performed with a HITACHI L-2000
(Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Separations were
carried out at 30uC with an Inertsil ODS-3, 5 mm, 4.66250 mm
(GL sciences). Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and solvent B
was acetonitrile. The initial composition of the binary solvent was
B 50% from 0 to 5.0 min. Solvent B was increased from 50 to
100% over 5.0 min. The composition of solvent remained for
5.0 min at B 100%, with the flow rate set at 1.0 mL min21
. Ten
microliters of the sample solution was subjected and fluorescence
was monitored. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 280
and 335 nm respectively. The sampling rate was set at 0.4 second.
The data at one run was acquired for 20 min. The control of
instrument, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed
with a D-2000 Elite (Hitachi High-Technologies).
Sample preparation for LC/MS/MS analysis
Blood was drawn from the heart using a heparinized syringe,
and centrifuged at 3,0006 g for 10 min at 4uC. Two hundred
microliters of methanol and 50 mL of 0.4 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl
sulfate (internal standard, in 15% acetonitrile) were added to
50 mL of the collected serum, and then the sample was incubated
at 220uC for 1 h. Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged at
20,0006g for 15 min at 4uC and the supernatant was dried in a
vacuum centrifugal dryer. Afterward, the residue was dissolved
with 100 mL of 15% acetonitrile. The solution was centrifuged at
20,0006g for 5 min at 4uC. The supernatant was applied to LC/
MS/MS analysis.
LC/MS/MS analysis for indoxyl sulfate
LC/MS/MS analyses were performed on a Waters ACQUITY
UPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Qattro Premier XE triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). LC separations were
carried out at 30uC with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column,
1.7 mm, 2.16100 mm (Waters). Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic
acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile. The initial composition of the
binary solvent was 15% B from 0 to 3.0 min. Solvent B was
increased from 15 to 100% over 2.0 min and the composition of
solvent remained for 1.0 min at 100% B. The flow rate was set at
0.3 mL min21
. Five microliters of sample solution was applied to
LC/MS/MS analysis. Mass spectrometer was operated using an
electrospray ionization source in the negative mode. The
ionization parameters were capillary voltage, 4.5 kV; extractor
voltage, 2 V; source temperature, 120uC; desolvation temperature,
350uC; desolvation gas flow, 800 L/h; cone gas flow, 50 L/h.
Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was conducted. SRM
transitions (m/z of precursor ion/m/z of product ion) for indoxyl
sulfate were 212.0/79.9 (quantification) and 212.0/131.8 (identi￾fication). For a former transition, cone voltage and collision energy
were set at 26 V and 22 eV. For a latter transition, they were set at
26 V and 18 eV. SRM transitions for 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate
were 255.0/174.9 (quantification) and 255.0/132.8 (identifica￾tion). For the former transition, cone voltage and collision energy
were set at 28 V and 16 eV, while for the latter transition, they
were set at 28 V and 36 eV. The dwell time for each SRM
transition was set at 100 ms and the data at one run were acquired
for 10 min. The control of instrument, data acquisition, and data
analysis were performed with a MassLynx 4.1 (Waters).
Isolation of intestinal epithelium
Intestines were incised longitudinally, washed to remove fecal
content, and incubated in HBSS containing 5 mM EDTA for
20 min at 37uC in a shaker, followed by vortexing for 1 min. After

centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min at 4uC, the pellet was used
as the intestinal epithelium.
Real-time RT-PCR
Epithelial samples were collected separately from 4 individual
mice maintained under either SPF or GF condition. Four mg of
RNA was reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Promega) and random primers (Toyobo) after treatment with
RQ1 DNase I (Promega). cDNAs were analyzed by qPCR using
the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) in ABI 7300 real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All data were normalized to the
expression of Gapdh, and the fold difference in expression relative
to that of Gapdh is shown. Amplification conditions were: 50uC
(2 min), 95uC (10 min), 40 cycles of 95uC (15 s), and 60uC (60 s).
Primers of Gapdh, Cldn7, Ocln, Tjp1, Ctnnb1, Cdh1 were purchased
from Invitrogen. The sequences of primers are listed in Table S1.
Caco-2 cell culture
Approximately 16104 Caco-2 cells were cultured on transwell
filters of 3.0 mm in the pore size (BD Biosciences). When the
transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) reached 1000 V (World
Precision Instruments ENDOHM 6), cells were considered to have
become confluent. After confirming the full confluency, 1 mM
indole or 2 mM indoxyl sulfate was added to both the upper and
lower chambers. DMF or PBS was used as controls respectively.
After 24 h incubation under each condition, total RNA was
extracted from the cultured cells by TRIzol reagent.
Induction of DSS colitis
Colitis was induced in male mice at the age of 8- to 12- weeks by
adding DSS (M.W = 36000–50000; MP Biomedicals) in the
drinking water for 5 days. DSS containing water was replaced
by tap water after 5 days, and mice were given the water until the
end of the experiments. Both body weights and survival rates in
each group were monitored throughout the experiments. The final
concentration of the DSS in the drinking water varied from 4 to
5% (w/v) as indicated in each experiment.
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse intestinal tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(Wako), and immersed in 30% sucrose for 24 h. The fixed tissues
were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura), and sections were
prepared with a thickness of 10 mm. Sections were blocked by 1%
BSA in PBS with Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 min, and stained with
either anti-occludin or anti-E-cadherin (1:100) antibody in PBS-T
containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h at 4uC, followed by secondary
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were stained with
DAPI for staining the nucleus, and mounted with PermaFluor
(Thermo SCIENTIFIC). Images were captured using a confocal
microscope (FV1000-D; Olympus).
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA and unpaired student’s t-test were used to
determine statistical significance. P values of less than 0.05 were
considered significant.
Results
Expression levels of junctional complex molecules are
decreased in colonic epithelia of GF mice
To examine whether commensal microbiota play an essential
role in establishing the epithelial barrier in the gut, mRNA
expression of TJ- or AJ-associated molecules were analyzed in SPF
and GF mice. Expression of TJ-associated molecules, such as
Cldn7, Ocln, and Tjp1, which encode claudin-7, occludin, and
zonula occludens (ZO)-1, respectively, was lower in the colonic
epithelia of GF mice than in those of SPF mice (Figure 1A). In
addition, expression of mRNAs that encode AJ-associated
molecules, represented by Ctnnb1 (encoding b-catenin) and Cdh1
(encoding E-cadherin), was also lower in GF mice than in SPF
Figure 2. Indole and indole metabolites are absent in GF mice. (A, B) Feces and serum were collected from either SPF (n = 3) or GF (n = 3)
mice. The concentration of indole in the feces was measured by HPLC-FL, and the serum concentration of indoxyl sulfate was measured by LC-MS/

mice (Figure 1A). In contrast, none of the TJ- or AJ-associated
molecules that were shown to be decreased in the colonic epithelia
of GF mice were decreased in the small intestines of GF mice
(Figure S1).
Immunohistochemical analysis further demonstrated that in GF
mice, protein expression of occludin was lower than in SPF mice
(Figure 1B). These results suggest that in the absence of
commensal microbiota, expression of junctional complex mole￾cules in colonic ECs is reduced. To examine whether the decrease
in the expression of junctional complex molecules affects
susceptibility to chemical insult of gut epithelium, we challenged
SPF and GF mice with oral DSS treatment. SPF mice and GF
mice were treated with 4% DSS for 3 days, and the survival rates
and changes in weight were monitored. In accordance with a
previous report [19], GF mice were more sensitive to DSS-induced
epithelial damage compared with SPF mice (Figure 1C).
Indole concentration is decreased in the feces of GF mice
We next examined which factor produced by commensal
microbiota enhanced the barrier function of the colonic epithelial
cells. Indole was previously reported to enhance the expression of
various genes related to junctional complexes in the human
enterocyte cell line, HCT-8 [18]. Therefore, to analyze the extent
to which commensal microbiota contribute to the production of
indole in the intestinal lumen, we measured the concentration of
indole in the feces of SPF mice and GF mice by an HPLC-FL
assay (Figure 2A). Indole concentration was severely reduced in
the feces of GF mice compared with those of SPF mice by 27-fold.
When the host absorbs indole, it is metabolized to indoxyl sulfate
by specific enzymes [20,21]. Indeed, LC-MS/MS analysis showed
that serum concentration of indoxyl sulfate was severely decreased
in GF mice (Figure 2B). Thus, commensal microbiota contribute
to production of substantial amount of indole in the gut lumen,
and to the increase in the concentration of indole metabolites. We
next analyzed whether indole or indoxyl sulfate play a role in
establishing intestinal epithelial barrier. Indole promoted mRNA
expression of TJ-associated molecules, such as Cldn7, Ocln, and
Tjp1 in the human adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2 (Figure 3A).
This is consistent with previously reported observations in HCT-8
cells [18]. In contrast, indoxyl sulfate-treatment rather showed a
slight reduction in the mRNA expression levels of all of these genes
(Figure 3B). The mRNA expression of AJ-associated molecules,
represented by Ctnnb1 and Cdh1, was unaffected in both indole￾and indoxyl sulfate-treated conditions. Thus, in Caco-2 cells,
expression of TJ-associated molecules is induced by indole, but not
its metabolite, indoxyl sulfate.
GF mice given indole-containing capsules show
enhanced expression of junctional complex molecules,
and are more resistant to DSS-induced epithelial damage
To examine whether indole possesses the capacity to enhance
intestinal epithelial barrier functions in vivo, we used seamless
microcapsules to deliver the compound to the colonic epithelium
[22]. To confirm the successful delivery and the dissolution of
these capsules at the colon, capsules containing carbon powder
were prepared and administered orally to the mice. Three hours
after the administration, the capsules were shown to successfully dis￾solve at the end portion of the small intestine (Figure S2). MCT- or
indole- containing capsules were then prepared following the same
manufacturing processes. HPLC analysis showed that indole
concentration in the feces of GF mice given indole-containg
capsules for 2 weeks reached approximately one third of that
observed in SPF mice (Figure 4A). These mice given indole￾containing capsules for 2 weeks showed increased mRNA
expression of Cldn7, Ocln, and Tjp1 in colonic ECs. Additionally,
mRNA expression of AJ-associated molecules, such as Ctnnb1 and
Cdh1, was also increased in GF mice given indole-containing
capsules (Figure 4B). In contrast, none of the junctional complex
molecules that showed increased expression in the colonic ECs were
increased in the small intestine, reflecting the release of the active
compound from the capsules in the distal small intestine (Figure S3).
Immunohistochemical analysis further demonstrated the in￾crease in occludin expression in the colonic epithelia for the
indole-treated group (Figure 4C). Because indole was suggested to
play a critical role in establishing epithelial junctional complexes,
we next examined whether indole treatment ameliorates the
disease course in GF mice challenged with DSS. After indole- or
MCT-containing capsules were given orally for 2 weeks, GF mice
were given 4% DSS, and survival rates were monitored. Only 15%
of GF mice treated with indole-containing capsules died during the
induction of DSS-colitis, whereas the mortality rate was over 90%
in the MCT-treated group (Figure 4D).
Indole reduces the weight loss of SPF mice with DSS￾induced colitis
Because indole was shown to have beneficial effects against
DSS-mediated epithelial damage in GF mice, we next examined
whether indole could also ameliorate the disease course in SPF
mice. When SPF mice were treated with either indole- or MCT￾containing capsules for 1 week prior to the induction of DSS
colitis, significant decrease in the weight loss was observed in the
indole-treated group (Figure 5). Thus, indole treatment has
beneficial effects on DSS-mediated epithelial impairment, even
in the presence of physiological level of indole.
Discussion
In the current study, we demonstrated that indole, a bacterial
QS molecule, promotes the establishment of the intestinal
epithelial barrier in vivo. Expression of junctional complex
molecules was decreased in colonic epithelia of GF mice, where
indole production was lower as measured from feces. GF mice
given indole-containing capsules showed increased expression of
TJ- and AJ-associated molecules. GF mice treated with indole￾containing capsules showed a higher resistance to epithelial
damage induced by DSS. The preventative effect of indole against
DSS was also demonstrated in SPF mice.
Our study demonstrated that the gut epithelium of GF mice had
significantly reduced expression of TJ- and AJ-associated mole￾cules exclusively in the colon. Considering that as much as 1011–13
bacteria exist per gram of colonic intestinal content [23], the
presence of commensal microbiota is suggested to be crucial for
the proper development of the colonic intestinal barrier. Indeed,
several reports demonstrated that certain strains of commensal
bacteria possess the capacity to promote intestinal barrier integrity.
Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, for example, was shown to

promote the expression and redistribution of ZO-2 in vitro [24].
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was reported to prevent TEER decrease
in cell monolayers after treatment with TNF-a and IFN-c [25].
Our study showed that indole produced by commensal microbiota
contributes to this process. In addition to indole, there are several
QS molecules used by microbes such as 7-hydroxyindole, isatin,
and competence and sporulation factor (CSF) [26,27]. CSF
derived from Bacillus subtilis, for example, was reported to activate
p38 and Akt pathway, and also induces heat shock proteins, which
prevent oxidant-induced impairment in ECs [28]. Identifying
other QS molecules with essential roles in maintaining the
intestinal epithelial barrier is warranted in the future investiga￾tions.
Unlike in the colon, in the small intestine of GF mice, there was
no significant alteration in the expression of junctional complex
molecules. A previous study showed that extracts of certain foods,
such as linden and star anise, decrease the permeability of Caco-2
cell monolayers [29]. Deprivation of glutamine was also reported
to result in reduced claudin-1 expression, and TEER decrease in
Caco-2 cells [30]. Given that the main function of the small
intestine is absorption of dietary nutrition, the induction of
junctional complexes in the small intestine might be regulated by
certain dietary components. Characterizing the dietary substances
that promote epithelial barrier functions will help us understand
the regulatory mechanism of the mucosal barrier in the small
intestine.
Both our in vitro and in vivo studies clearly demonstrated that
indole treatment induced the mRNA expression of junctional
complex molecules. This is consistent with the previous report that
showed indole enhanced the TJ-associated molecule mRNAs, such
as Cldn7 and Tjp1, in HCT-8 cells [18]. However, it remains
unknown which specific receptor or signaling pathway is involved
in indole-mediated regulation of host ECs. For the induction of
occuldin, a direct interaction of thyroid transcripton factor-1 with
the Ocln promoter is considerd to be essential [31]. The AP-1
transcription factor, JunD, was shown to regulate the transcription
and translation of Tjp1 [32]. On the other hand, previous report
showed that the expression of Cldn7 was regulated by ELF3, an
epithelia-specific member of Ets family of transcriptional factors
[33]. It would be interesting to investigate which of these pathways
is specifically involved in the enhancement of the epithelial barrier
by indole.
After indole is absorbed in the intestine, it is metabolized in
phase 1 of xenobiotic metabolism to indoxyl by the cytochrome
P450 isoform, Cyp2e1, then to indoxyl sulfate by sulfotransferase
1a1, Sult1a1, in phase 2. The conversion of indole into indoxyl
sulfate is thought to occur in the liver [20,21], but Cyp2e1 and
Sult1a1 are expressed in colonic ECs [34,35]. Therefore, it is
possible that effects of indole on host ECs are mediated by one of
its metabolites, indoxyl sulfate. Our in vitro studies, however,
demonstrated that indole, but not its metabolite, indoxyl sulfate,
serves as the critical factor to enhance the epithelial barrier
functions. The fact that indole itself promotes epithelial barrier
functions indicates that receptors that recognize hydrophobic
ligands are somehow involved in the pathway by which this occurs
[36]. It would be interesting to analyze whether other indole
derivatives, such as hydroxyindole, which is known to serve as a
QS molecule, are capable of exerting similar effects on epithelial
barrier functions in the future.
In GF mice treated with indole, a higher resistance to DSS￾mediated epithelial insult was observed. Previous studies have
shown that breakdown of the mucous and epithelial barrier
underlies the DSS-induced damage [37,38]. In this regard, the
importance of junctional complex molecules is suggested for the
protection against DSS-induced epithelial damage [39]. In the
acute phase of DSS-mediated colitis, junctional complexes are
initially disrupted by DSS and this impairment allows the luminal
bacteria to invade into the lamina propria, resulting in inflamma￾tory responses at the chronic phase. The critical role of claudin-7
in preventing intestinal inflammation was previously reported.
Mice deficient for Cldn7 were reported to suffer from spontaneous
development of colitis [40]. Thus, indole-mediated up-regulation
of TJ-associated molecules might contribute to the resistance to
intestinal inflammation. Alternatively, the observed changes in the
tight junction proteins may reflect an increase in epithelial
polarity. Whether the protection conferred by indole-treatment

is mediated by enhanced mucous layer by these well-differentiated
ECs would be an interesting issue to investigate in the future.
It is of note that the beneficial effects of indole were also
observed in SPF mice challenged with DSS. This observation
suggests that oral supplementation of indole can enhance the
mucosal barrier functions even in the condition when the
physiological level of indole is present. In recent years, probiotics
have attracted much attention for their preventative effect on
intestinal inflammation [41]. It would be interesting to examine
whether commensal microbiota-derived metabolites can be
applied in the future as a therapeutic option for the treatment of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
