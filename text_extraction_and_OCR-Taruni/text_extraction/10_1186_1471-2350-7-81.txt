Abstract
Background: Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a recessively-inherited disorder of iron
over-absorption prevalent in Caucasian populations. Affected individuals for Type 1 HH are usually
either homozygous for a cysteine to tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 282 (C282Y) of
the HFE gene, or compound heterozygotes for C282Y and for a histidine to aspartic acid change at
position 63 (H63D). Molecular genetic testing for these two mutations has become widespread in
recent years. With diverse testing methods and reporting practices in use, there was a clear need
for agreed guidelines for haemochromatosis genetic testing. The UK Clinical Molecular Genetics
Society has elaborated a consensus process for the development of disease-specific best practice
guidelines for genetic testing.
Methods: A survey of current practice in the molecular diagnosis of haemochromatosis was
conducted. Based on the results of this survey, draft guidelines were prepared using the template
developed by UK Clinical Molecular Genetics Society. A workshop was held to develop the draft
into a consensus document. The consensus document was then posted on the Clinical Molecular
Genetics Society website for broader consultation and amendment.
Results: Consensus or near-consensus was achieved on all points in the draft guidelines. The
consensus and consultation processes worked well, and outstanding issues were documented in an
appendix to the guidelines.
Conclusion: An agreed set of best practice guidelines were developed for diagnostic, predictive
and carrier testing for hereditary haemochromatosis and for reporting the results of such testing.
Background
The term haemochromatosis was originally used by von
Recklinghausen in 1889 [1] to describe tissue injury
caused by increased levels of iron. A modern definition of
haemochromatosis describes it as an inherited disorder of
iron metabolism, characterized by inappropriately high
absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading
to excessive storage of iron (particularly in the liver, skin,
pancreas, heart, joints and testes) and ultimately resulting
in impaired organ structure and function [2,3].
Haemochromatosis can be due to mutations in a number
of genes (Table 1) but in terms of prevalence and pheno￾type, the most important type is that due to mutations in
HFE, termed Type 1 hereditary haemochromatosis (HH).
HFE-related HH arises predominantly in males between

40 and 60 years and it is particularly common in people
of Northern European descent where it affects 1 in every
200–300 individuals. The condition has an autosomal
recessive mode of inheritance and, depending on the pop￾ulation, 80–93% of clinically symptomatic individuals
are homozygous for the HFE mutation, C282Y (G845A),
with most of the remainder being compound heterozy￾gotes for C282Y and H63D (C187G). Clinical expression
is variable and a significant proportion of individuals with
these genotypes do not develop the condition, which
demonstrates low penetrance of the mutations and
emphasises the need to define the genetic modifiers and
environmental factors which contribute to iron overload
in these individuals [4-7].
Treatment of haemochromatosis usually involves removal
of excess iron by weekly therapeutic phlebotomy (i.e.,
removal of blood) to reduce the serum ferritin concentra￾tion and the transferrin saturation. After initial treatment,
normal iron levels are usually maintained by occasional
phlebotomy. Specifics regarding treatment can be found
in guidelines published by The British Committee for
Standards in Haematology [8]. The earlier the diagnosis is
made, and treatment to normalize serum iron studies
commenced, the greater the likelihood that all the poten￾tial serious complications of HH can be prevented [3,5].
Clinical presentation and reasons for referral
Early symptoms are relatively non-specific and include
abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy and weight loss.
Untreated individuals may develop hepatic fibrosis or cir￾rhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 25% of
patients with established cirrhosis. In addition, untreated
individuals may also develop progressive increase in skin
pigmentation, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure
and/or arrhythmias, arthritis and hypogonadism. Symp￾tomatic individuals have biochemical evidence of iron
overload (elevated serum transferrin saturation and ferri￾tin concentration) and such biochemical evidence is
found even in the absence of symptoms [2,4,5].
Confirmatory diagnostic testing currently involves molecular
genetic testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the
HFE gene or histological assessment of hepatic iron stores
on liver biopsy. Most individuals with HFE related HH are
either homozygotes for the C282Y mutation (80–93%) or
compound heterozygotes for the mutations C282Y and
H63D (<5%). Genetic testing for non-HFE related haemo￾chromatosis is not widely available and diagnosis may
have to be based on liver biopsy findings [4,5].
Predictive testing for at-risk relatives (e.g. siblings of genet￾ically confirmed HH individuals) may be requested as
well as carrier testing for family members.
Pre-natal diagnosis is not usually offered as the condition is
a treatable, adult onset condition.
Population screening is not currently recommended prima￾rily due to the penetrance issue surrounding the C282Y
mutation [2].
Methods
A survey of current practice in the molecular diagnosis of
haemochromatosis was conducted by means of standard
questionnaire. Based on the results of this survey, draft
guidelines were prepared using the template developed by
UK Clinical Molecular Genetics Society. A workshop was
held to develop the draft into a consensus document. The
consensus document was then posted on the Clinical
Molecular Genetics Society website for broader consulta￾tion and amendment.

Criteria for testing
The clinical criteria required for molecular genetic testing
to proceed depend on local guidelines. Suggested bio￾chemical criteria include elevated, fasting, serum transfer￾rin saturation and persistently raised serum ferritin
concentration. Numerically, local biochemical testing
methodologies will dictate what constitutes elevated

transferrin saturation but a result of 45% would generally
be accepted for genetic testing, particularly to facilitate
early detection of iron overload. A value exceeding the
local upper limit of normal constitutes an elevated con￾centration of ferritin. However, an elevated ferritin is not
specific for HH and therefore should be considered in
conjunction with indicators of inflammation and liver
disease.
Iron studies are not necessary for predictive testing but
such cases may benefit from a referral to a clinical genetics
service.
Carrier testing is routinely offered to close relatives of con￾firmed cases or of confirmed carriers. When devising a car￾rier testing policy, it is worth considering whether more
distant relatives have carrier risks elevated above that of
the general population.
Testing strategy
A large number of methods are used by laboratories. Most
use a combination of PCR and restriction enzyme digest
for one or both mutations. Other methods employed
include real time PCR (LightCycler), allele-specific PCR,
heteroduplex analysis and PCR-SSCP. The EMQN and
UKNEQAS assessors have commented on the small
number of mistakes and general reliability of the wide
range of different technological approaches used.
It is important to note that the S65C variant (A193T),
which is just six bases away from the H63D mutation, has
been reported to interfere with H63D analysis for some
methods such as the LightCycler [9] and the Stott duplex
method [10] (Mark Hill, Kieran Guinan; personal com￾munications), such that H63D/S65C compound hetero￾zygotes appear as H63D homozygotes. Therefore,
apparent H63D homozygotes detected by such methods
must be subjected to further analysis to out rule interfer￾ence by S65C giving an erroneous result.
The method in the original paper describing the HFE gene
may be compromised by a sequence variation under the
reverse primer for C282Y, under some conditions [11]
and a modified primer [12] should be used instead. A sur￾vey of European laboratories indicated that use of the
original primer had not compromised HFE genotyping
[13].
Homozygotes for C282Y and C282Y/H63D compound
heterozygotes are known to be predisposed to the devel￾opment of HH. As the significance of H63D in the
homozygous state is unclear, H63D testing is currently
only clinically useful in individuals heterozygous for
C282Y. This would seem to imply that, ideally, C282Y
should be tested for initially and H63D analysis per￾formed on C282Y heterozygotes only as a reflex test. How￾ever, when there is a family history of HH, both mutations
should be tested for, even if the index case is homozygous
for C282Y and especially if extensive screening has not
been performed in the family. The reason is that, due to
the high carrier frequency of H63D (25% in the general
population) [5], it is possible for both C282Y and H63D
to be present in the same family and therefore for a family
member to be a compound heterozygote at risk of iron
overload. Such scenarios would be missed by reflex test￾ing. H63D testing is appropriate when carrier status is
required due to family history or for a spouse of a
homozygote or heterozygote. Where a method detects
both mutations concurrently, there is an obligation to
report the complete result.
With respect to testing for mutations/variants other than
C282Y & H63D, there is little published evidence that
warrants such testing for diagnostic purposes. If a method
picks up S65C, a lab may have an obligation to report the
presence of this variant if it occurs in a compound hetero￾zygote state with C282Y [14,15,18]. However, in the
absence of any clinical merit, it would be best to avoid
detecting S65C and hence the obligation to report on it is
removed.
Reporting
Each laboratory has its own reporting format and guid￾ance is available [19,20]. The following represents some
basic guidelines for reporting HH genotypes based on rea￾son for referral and resulting genotype. Points regarded as
essential are highlighted in italics.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and genotype C282Y 
homozygous
Reports should state, at a minimum, that this genotype is con￾sistent with a diagnosis of HH. Additional comments may
refer to implications of the result for other family mem￾bers, offer carrier testing and suggest that genetic counsel￾ling be considered. It is not considered appropriate to
state that all relatives must/should be tested.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and genotype C282Y/
H63D compound heterozygous
Some patients with this genotype have iron overload but
to a lesser degree than C282Y homozygotes [7]. This gen￾otype should therefore have a less weighted interpretation
than for a C282Y homozygote referred on the same basis.
Approximately 5% of patients with HH have this geno￾type but so also does 2% of the general UK population.
Therefore, the genotype is consistent with the presence of iron
overload and may be diagnostic of HH once all other reasons
for iron overload have been excluded (e.g. alcohol consumption,
hepatitis C, hyperferritinaemia). Additional comments may
refer to implications of the result for other family mem-

bers, offer carrier testing and suggest that genetic counsel￾ling be considered. It is not considered appropriate to
state that all relatives must/should be tested.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and genotype C282Y 
heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the C282Y mutation. This geno￾type makes a diagnosis of HH unlikely and such a diagnosis can
only be made on a clinical basis. It has been documented that
about 25% of C282Y heterozygotes may exhibit mild to
moderately raised indices of iron overload [5]. However,
complications in C282Y heterozygotes due to iron over￾load are rare and may be influenced by additional factors,
both genetic and environmental. In addition, other forms
of iron overload and other types of haemochromatosis
exist, therefore, a referral to a specialist unit may be sug￾gested. Additional comments may refer to implications of
the result for other family members and suggest that
genetic counselling be considered. It is not considered
appropriate to state that all relatives must/should be
tested. The report should not state that a diagnosis of
haemochromatosis is excluded.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and genotype H63D 
homozygous
This genotype is present in about 2% of the population
and its significance remains uncertain. It has been sug￾gested that H63D homozygotes have a slight risk of iron
overload [16-18] and therefore a diagnosis of haemochroma￾tosis cannot be excluded and must be made on a clinical basis.
Additional comments may offer carrier testing for other
family members and suggest that genetic counselling be
considered. It is not considered appropriate to state that
all relatives must/should be tested.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and genotype H63D 
heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the H63D mutation. This geno￾type makes a diagnosis of HH very unlikely and such a diagno￾sis can only be made on a clinical basis. Other forms of iron
overload and other types of haemochromatosis exist,
therefore, a referral to a specialist unit may be suggested.
Additional comments may refer to implications of the
result for other family members and suggest that genetic
counselling be considered. It is not considered appropri￾ate to state that all relatives must/should be tested.The
report should not state that a diagnosis of haemochromatosis is
excluded.
Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual) and a normal genotype
This genotype makes a diagnosis of HH very unlikely and such
a diagnosis can only be made on a clinical basis. Other forms
of iron overload and other types of haemochromatosis
exist therefore a referral to a specialist unit may be sug￾gested.
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and genotype 
C282Y homozygous
The individual is at risk of developing iron overload/HH and it
is recommended that the indices of iron overload (fasting,
serum transferrin saturation and ferritin) be regularly moni￾tored. Suggested frequency for biochemical monitoring of
individuals with this genotype is yearly [5]. Additional
comments may suggest a referral to a specialist. The report
may refer to implications of the result for other family
members and suggest that genetic counselling be consid￾ered. It is not accurate to state that the individual has HH
or will develop HH. It is not considered appropriate to
state that all relatives must/should be tested.
Reported penetrance values (in terms of iron accumula￾tion) for C282Y homozygosity range from 50% to 96%
depending on the definition of iron overload used in the
studies [6,7]. Since penetrance is age related and gender
influenced, these factors must be incorporated into any
genotype/phenotype correlation. Lyon and Frank [7] have
summarised that the penetrance of C282Y homozygosity
in males over 40 years is 95% for iron overload, when cor￾rected for age and gender. For males under 40 years, the
value is 80% with additional symptoms present in 12% of
males in this age group. In the over 40 year female age
group, 80% of C282Y homozygotes have iron overload
with 13% exhibiting other symptoms. Iron overload is
present in 39% of females under 40 years with no addi￾tional symptoms manifesting. In all cases, the penetrance
of clinical haemochromatosis is much lower than the pen￾etrance of iron overload [5-7].
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and C282Y/
H63D compound heterozygous
Five percent of individuals with HH have this genotype
but so do 2% of the general population and some individ￾uals with this genotype have iron overload but to a lesser
degree than C282Y homozygotes [4-6]. The individual may
be at risk of developing iron overload/HH and it is recom￾mended that the indices of iron overload (transferrin satura￾tion, ferritin) be regularly monitored. Suggested frequency
for biochemical monitoring of individuals with this geno￾type is every three years [5]. Additional comments may
suggest a referral to a specialist. The report may refer to
implications of the result for other family members and
suggest that genetic counselling be considered. It is not
accurate to state that the individual has HH or will
develop HH.
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and C282Y 
heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the C282Y mutation. The individ￾ual is at less than the population risk of developing HFE related
HH. The presence of additional risk factors cannot be
excluded. Suggested frequency for biochemical monitor-

ing of individuals with this genotype is every five years [5].
The report may refer to implications of the result for other
family members and suggest that genetic counselling be
considered.
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and H63D 
homozygous
It has been suggested that H63D homozygotes have a
slight risk of iron overload, therefore, regular monitoring
of the biochemical indices of iron overload (ferritin and
transferrin saturation levels) may be suggested. The report
may suggest that genetic counselling be considered. It is
not accurate to state that the individual has HH or will
develop HH.
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and H63D 
heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the H63D mutation. The individ￾ual is at no increased risk of iron overload. The report may
refer to implications of the result for other family mem￾bers and may suggest that genetic counselling be consid￾ered.
Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected) and normal 
genotype
The individual is unlikely to develop HH.
Carrier status referral and C282Y heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the C282Y mutation. The report
may refer to implications of the result for other family
members and suggest that genetic counselling be consid￾ered. The report may suggest carrier testing for any part￾ner.
Carrier status referral and H63D heterozygous
The individual is a carrier of the H63D mutation. The report
may suggest carrier testing for any partner.
Carrier status referral and normal genotype
The individual is not a carrier of the C282Y or H63D muta￾tions.
Information points on reports
Reports should contain information on the method used
to generate the result, the sensitivity and specificity of the
method if known and figures relating to haemochromato￾sis in the population being reported on, complete with
references. These information points are best kept periph￾eral and not in the main body of the report.
Other issues
Testing of minors
Guidelines from The Clinical Genetics Society [21] and
the American College of Medical Genetics [22] recom￾mend not to test minors (under 16 years of age) for carrier
status for late onset disorders. It is possible to offer to test
parents and from this information, determine the approx￾imate risk to each child of inheriting a genotype predis￾posing to the development of HH. The child may then
choose to have their own carrier status investigated when
they reach 16 years.
Discussion/conclusion
An agreed set of best practice guidelines has now been
developed for diagnostic, predictive and carrier testing for
hereditary haemochromatosis and for reporting the
results of such testing. The consensus and consultation
processes worked well. From the feedback received fol￾lowing the workshop, remaining issues concern the real
need to test for H63D and the carrier testing of spouses.
H63D testing
The issue here is a mixture of clinicians who think that
seeing families where only H63D is segregating may not
be the most appropriate use of health care resources.
Other specialties such as hepatology feel that the risk of
iron overload in H63D homozygotes is evident in their
clinical experience. The authors feel that the concerns over
testing for H63D seem to be due primarily to clinical and
laboratory workload implications. Some laboratories
have adopted a reflex testing strategy while others have
advocated use of streamlining referrals and testing for
both mutations rather than reflex testing. As indicated in
the agreed guidelines, when there is a family history of
HH, both mutations should be tested for, even if the index
case is homozygous for C282Y and especially if extensive
screening has not been performed in the family. The rea￾son is that, due to the high carrier frequency of H63D
(25% in the general population) [5], it is possible for both
C282Y and H63D to be present in the same family and
therefore for a family member to be a compound hetero￾zygote at risk of iron overload. Therefore, while reflex test￾ing is not discouraged, testing for H63D only on patients
heterozygous for C282Y, may be too constrained a policy.
This implies that the benefit of reflex testing may be
diminished if other considerations have to be taken into
account (e.g. family history). It then remains a local deci￾sion as to whether to abandon reflex testing and test for
both HFE mutations.
As the debate continues on the role (if any) of H63D in
iron overload (there are individuals homozygous for this
mutation who are iron overloaded but this may or may
not be due to H63D), it is the view of the authors that we
should continue to test for it. As the contribution of other
genes to iron overload becomes established, it is envis￾aged that there will eventually be a call for an "iron over￾load" genetic screen as opposed to an HFE genetic screen.

It would be useful, if hepatologists and other disciplines
published their clinical findings regarding H63D
homozygotes. There may be a need to investigate other
genes to ensure that any positive association is due to
H63D alone.
Testing of spouses
The value of a couple knowing that their child is at risk of
a C282Y homozygous genotype was queried since there
are no clinical consequences until well into adulthood
and such testing only adds to laboratory workload and
costs. The authors feel that many C282Y homozygotes
and heterozygotes identified by HH testing will have adult
offspring, so there could be some value in testing spouses
to assess risks in such cases. If their spouse is shown not to
carry either HFE mutation, offspring may be shown not to
be at risk and therefore the need for, and cost of testing, is
avoided.
