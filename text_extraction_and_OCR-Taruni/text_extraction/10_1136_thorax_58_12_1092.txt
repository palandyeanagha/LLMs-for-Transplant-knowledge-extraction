Abstract


The pathogenesis and clinical features of gastro-oesophageal reflux
related cough are complex and the diagnostic tests available are of
limited reliability. Treatment needs to be tailored to the specific
needs of individual patients and other possible causes of chronic
cough should be investigated. Treatment should only be considered
to have failed when cough persists after administration of proton
pump inhibitors at an adequate dosage for a sufficient length of
time.
