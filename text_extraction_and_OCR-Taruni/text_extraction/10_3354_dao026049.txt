ABSTRACT: The renal response to 2 doses of gentamicin (low dose of 5 mg kg-' of body weight and 
high dose of 25 mg kg-' of body weight) was examined in the tilapian fish Oreochromis nilotica. 
Gentamicin exposure induced acute tubular necrosis that peaked in severity at 2 d following intra￾peritonea] injection of the high dose and at 4 to 7 d following injection of the low dose. Necrosis 
following high dose exposure was more severe than that following low dose exposure. Histochemical 
staining for gamma glutamyl transpeptidase showed the site of injury to be localized in the proximal 
tubules. Immunohistochemical staining with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was used to mark cell prolifera￾tion during regeneration and nephroneogenesis. Regeneration of epithelia1 cells along the basement 
membrane of damaged tubules and development of new nephrons were both documented following 
nephrotoxic injury. Although the overall pattern of renal response to gentamicin exposure was similar 
to that which has been previously documented in other freshwater fish species, the commercially 
important tdapian fish was significantly more sensitive than other fishes.

INTRODUCTION 
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial agent 
that inhiblts bacterial protein synthesis. This drug has 
a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative 
bacteria. The severe nephrotoxicity of gentamicin at 
therapeutic doses is, however, a major impediment to 
routine therapeutic use of this agent (Houghton et al. 
1976, Kaloyanides & Pastoriza-Munoz 1980, Porter & 
Bennett 1981, Seale & Rennert 1982, Silverblatt 1982, 
Cojocel et al. 1984). 
The study of the bacterial pathogens of fish and their 
sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, including gen￾tamicin, has expanded rapidly (Ceschia et al. 1987, 
Schmitt et al. 1989, Fryer et al. 1990, Baya et al. 1991, 
Borrego et al. 1991), and the use of aminoglycosides 
'Addressee for correspondence. E-mail: stsmith7@vt.edu 
in the treatment of fish bacterial infections is well 
described (Stoskopf et al. 1986, Stoskopf 1988). The 
pharmacokinetics of gentamicin has been evaluated in 
the channel catfish (Rolf & Setser 1984). As clinical use 
of gentamicin in fish has increased, so has documenta￾tion of its toxicity in fish species, specifically its 
nephrotoxicity (Charnie & Reimschuessel 1994, Reim￾schuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994). Pre￾vious work described the histopathological changes in 
the fish kidney following exposure to gentamicin 
(Reimschuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994). 
Study of gentamicin nephrotoxicity in goldfish Caras￾sius auratus has shown characteristic changes in the 
proximal tubules of the nephron, including nuclear 
pyknosis and sloughing of the tubular epithelium 
(Reimschuessel & Williams 1994). The most startling 
finding to have arisen from these studies is the remark￾able reparative ability of kidney tissue in the investi￾gated fish species.

The ability of fish to regenerate apparently normal 
tissues and organs following injury or removal has long 
been known (Oliver 1915, Goss 1969). The regenera￾tion of fish tissues following nephrotoxic insult has 
recently been the focus of much investigation (Reim￾schuessel et al. 1990, 1993, Lombarte et al. 1993, 
Chamie & Reimschuessel 1994, Reimschuessel & 
Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994). Immunohisto￾chemical staining for the uptake of 5-bromo-2'- 
deoxyuridine (BrDU) has been used to detect cellu￾lar replication (Gratzner 1982, de Fazio et al. 1987, 
Schutte et al. 1987) and document the patterns by 
which fish kidneys regenerate. Goldfish Carassius 
auratus exposed to nephrotoxic injury repaired kidney 
tissue by 2 distinct mechanisms. The first of these 
mechanisms is shared with mammals and involves 
repopulation of denuded tubules by replication and 
migration of tubular epithelial cells along the intact 
basement membrane. The second mechanism is 
unknown in mammals and involves nephroneogenesis, 
the creation of new nephrons, in their entirety, from 
small clusters of basophilic-staining cells in the renal 
interstitium (Reimschuessel et al. 1990). Nephroneo￾genesis following sublethal toxic insults may have pro￾found implications for reversing serious renal injury 
resulting from aminoglycoside antibacterial therapy in 
fish. If nephroneogenesis occurs in other fish species, 
and not merely goldfish and salmonids, indications for 
the use of aminoglycosides in the treatment of bacter￾ial fish diseases may be expanded. 
To date, no studies have been reported on the 
nephrotoxicity of gentamicin in the tilapian fishes, or 
on the capacity of these species for nephroneogenesis. 
Oreochromis nilotica, an African cichlid fish, is exten￾sively cultured and harvested as a food source. The 
hardiness, ready availability, and commercial impor￾tance of this fish make it exceptionally well suited for 
investigation as a representative of the tilapian fishes. 
METHODS 
Expt 1: gentamicin exposure. A total of 270 juvenile 
tilapia Oreochromis nilotica, measuring 3 to 8 cm in 
length and weighing 5 to 20 g, were arbitrarily divided 
into 3 groups: control, low dose, and high dose. Control 
fish received a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 10 
m1 kg-' sterile 0.09% saline solution. Low dose fish 
received a single IP injection of 5 mg kg-' gentamicin 
as 10 m1 kg-' of a 0.5 mg ml-l solution of gentamicin in 
sterile saline solution. High dose fish received a single 
IP injection of 25 mg kg-' gentamicin as 10 m1 kg-' of 
a 2.5 mg ml-' solution of gentamicin in sterile saline 
solution. Fish were maintained in filtered tap water 
at 70 to 74°F (21-24°C) in established 20 gallon (75 1) 
aquaria with a stocking density of 30 or fewer fish per 
aquarium. Fish were fed a ground commercial fish diet 
(Zeigler Brothers, Gardner, PA, USA). Water quality 
was monitored with weekly assessments of ammonia 
and nitrite and maintained with 50% water changes 
weekly. Mortality of fish following injection was moni￾tored and recorded daily. 
Five fish from each group were sampled for histo￾logic examination at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 
and 42 d following injection. Fish were euthanized by 
anesthetic overdose with tricaine methane sulfonate 
(MS-222, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) 
followed by cervical dislocation. Kidney tissue was 
fixed in situ by immersion in a phosphate buffered 4 % 
formalid1 % glutaraldehyde solution (McDowell & 
Trump 1976). Fixed kidneys and surrounding tissues 
were then routinely processed for paraffin sectioning. 
Sections (6 pm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E). All sections were encoded and ran￾domized to prevent bias in interpretation and then 
examined by light microscopy. Pathological changes 
(interstitial edema, tubular dilation, necrosis, and 
epithelia1 regeneration along the tubule) were inde￾pendently graded on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 indi￾cating increasing degree and severity. Scores from the 
2 gentamicin-treated fish groups were then compared 
with each other and with control fish for each time 
period. Significant differences between groups were 
determined by t-test analysis (2-tailed, 2-sample of 
unequal variance, Microsoft Excel version 4.0). 
Nephroneogenesis was quantified by counting the 
number of developing nephrons found per unit area of 
caudal ludney tissue section on the encoded tissue 
slides. Developing nephrons were identified by their 
intense basophilia in comparison to surrounding tissue 
and their relatively smaller size and dense conforma￾tion (Reimschuessel et al. 1990, 1993, Reimschuessel & 
Williams 1994). The resulting ratio was compared 
across all groups from each time period. Statistical dif￾ferences between and within groups and time periods 
were distinguished as described above. 
Expt 2: staining for GGT activity. The enzyme 
marker gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was 
used to identify the proximal tubules and to document 
the presence of normal enzyme activity in the fresh, 
frozen tilapia kidney. Two juvenile tilapia with 
weights of 5 and 7 g and lengths of 6.5 and 7.7 cm, 
respectively, were utilized. The control fish received a 
single IP injection of 10 m1 kg-' sterile water. The 
treated fish received a single IP injection of 10 m1 kg-' 
of a 2.5 mg ml-' solution (25 mg kg-') of gentamicin in 
sterile water. Food was withheld following injection, 
and fish were maintained in isolated 50 gallon (190 1) 
aquaria with flow-through systems of filtered tap 
water. 

Augusto et a1 Nephrotox~city and nephroneogenesis in Oreochrom~s nllotlca 5 1 
Both fish were euthanized 3 d following injection. 
The caudal kidneys were removed and divided into 2 
pieces. The first piece was fixed in 10% formalin and 
routinely embedded in paraffin and processed for H&E 
sectioning. The second piece was embedded In Tissue￾Tek I1 O.C.T. Compound@ (Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN, 
USA), fast frozen with Frostbitem (Surgipath, Rich￾mond, IL, USA), and sectioned to make 6 pm frozen 
section slides. 
Earlier investigation had demonstrated that the 
established protocol utilizing formalin fixation resulted 
in loss of staining for GGT activity in tilapia renal 
tissue. To determine a method for obtaining an optimal 
combination of tissue fixation and staining for enzyme 
activity, frozen sections received different treatments. 
One frozen section slide received no post-fixation. The 
other frozen slides were post-fixed with a 1 min wash 
of chilled 95% ethanol, acetone, or 10% formalin. 
Frozen slides were then rinsed in phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS) and stained for GGT activity following 
established protocol (Rutenburg et al. 1969). Following 
GGT staining, 1 section on each slide was counter￾stained with Gills hematoxylin for 1 min and rinsed in 
water. Slides were then dried and coverslipped with 
glycerol gelatin. 
Tissues from the control fish kidney were assessed 
for presence of stain for GGT activity and preservation 
of morphology with respect to post-fixation technique. 
Differences in staining and morphology between the 
control and treated fish were also assessed within each 
technique. Paraffin embedded sections stained with 
H&E were used to correlate GGT staining differences 
with tissue pathology. 
Expt 3: staining for BrDU uptake. Eighteen adult 
tilapia, ranging in length from 13.5 to 16.5 cm and in 
weight from 33 to 82 g, were arbitrarily divided into 
2 groups of 9 fish each. The control group received a 
single IP injection of 10 m1 kg-' sterile water. The 
treated group received 25 mg kg-' gentamicin as a 
single IP injection of 10 m1 kg-' of a 2.5 mg ml-' solu￾tion of gentamicin in sterile water. Food was withheld 
following injection, and fish were maintained in estab￾lished 50 gallon (190 1) aquaria with flow-through 
systems of filtered tap water at a stocking density of 
6 or fewer fish per aquarium. 
Two fish from each group were sampled at 4, 7, and 
14 d following injection and treated with an IP injec￾tion of 10 m1 kg-' of a 10 mg ml-' solution of BrDU 
(Sigma Chemical Co.). Fish were euthanized 4 h fol￾lowing BrDU injection. Kidneys were removed and 
fixed in phosphate buffered 10 % formalin. Fixed tissue 
was routinely processed for paraffin sectioning. Sec￾tions (6 pm) were cut and 2 slides prepared from 
each sample. One slide was stained with routine H&E 
and the other was immunohistochemically stained 
for BrDU (de Fazio et al. 1987, Reimschuessel et al. 
1990). The BrDU and H&E sections were compared 
to identify areas of cell replication within collecting 
duct epithelium, among regenerating epithelia1 cells 
along the basement membrane of damaged tubules, 
and within developing nephrons. Differences in BrDU￾uptake between control and treated fish at each time 
period were assessed for the degree, locality, and 
chronology of cellular division following injection. 
RESULTS 
Expt 1: gentamicin exposure 
Clinical signs of toxicity (including anorexia, lethargy, 
exophthalmia, and abdominal distention) developed 
in the high dose group 2 d after injection, increased 
in severity until Day 5, and then regressed. No clinical 
signs were observed in the control or low dose fish. 
The mortality pattern for all 3 groups following IP 
injection is shown in Fig. 1. No mortality occurred after 
Day 5 post-injection. Total mortality during the entire 
course of this experiment was 0% for the control 
group, 1.3 % for the low dose group, and 29.9 % for the 
high dose group. 
The caudal kidney from control fish exemplified 
normal renal histological structure (Fig. 2A). The tilapia 
kidney was similar to that of other fish species in that it 
was not organized into cortical and medullary regions 
like mammalian kidneys. Glomeruli, proxinlal and dis￾tal convoluted tubules, and collecting ducts, each pre￾senting normal structural features, were found scattered 
throughout the caudal kidney (Sakai 1985). The normal 
tilapian kidney differs from that of many other fish 
species in its relative lack of hemopoietic and immuno￾2 -.-0-. control I

logic tissue in the renal interstitium of the caudal kid￾ney. Kidney tissue sections were examined for 5 histo￾pathological changes: interstitial edema (increased 
interstitial space between basement membranes), 
tubular dilation (increased tubule diameter from that 
found in normal tissue), necrosis, regeneration along 
the basement membrane, and nephroneogenesis. 
Mild edematous changes (Fig 2C, D) and moderate 
tubular dilation (Fig. 2C) were observed in all fish. 
Statistically significant increases in edema were found 
only in the Day 2, high dose group (Fig. 3). No sig￾nificant differences in tubular dilation were found 
between groups or time periods (Fig. 4). The degree 
of dilation and edema appeared to be exceedingly 
variable and relatively mild in all groups. 
Grading of renal tubular necrosis was based upon 
the degree and distribution of active cellular necrosis 
within the tubules. The most severe cases of tubular 
necrosis were found in the high dose group and 
presented cellular pyknosis and detachment of epithe￾lial cells from the basement membrane in every proxi￾mal tubule (Fig. 2B). Significant increases in renal 
tubular necrosis were found in the high dose group 
from Days 1 to 4, and in the low dose group at Days 4 
and 7 (Fig. 5). 
Regeneration along the tubular basement membrane 
was a characteristic sequel to profound tubular necro￾sis. Regenerating tubules were observed as basement 
membrane structures which partially or completely 
lacked normal tubular epithelium and were populated 
instead by small, flattened, basophilic (actively repli￾cating) cells (Fig. 2C). Significant increases in the 
degree of regeneration along the tubular basement 
membrane were evident only in the high dose group at 
3, 4, 14 and 21 d after gentamicin exposure (Fig. 6). 
Nephroneogenesis was characterized by the 
appearance of small, intensely basophilic clusters of

cells developing into small tubules and rudimentary

found adjacent to, and apparently invading, collect￾ing ducts (Fig. 2D). The number of developing 
nephrons per unit area of tissue section was used to 
quantify nephroneogenesis, and a significant increase 
in nephroneogenesis was evident only in the high 
dose group at Day 14 following injection (Fig. 7). 
Both high and low dose groups displayed decreases 
in number of new nephrons mm-* at varying time 
periods. The low dose group had a significant de￾crease in nephroneogenesis at l and 2 d following 
gentamicin exposure. The high dose group had a sig￾nificant decrease in nephroneogenesis from 1 to 4 d 
following injection (Fig. 7). No significant decreases 
or increases were found in the control group at any 
time.

Expt 2: staining for GGT activity 
Staining for GGT enzyme was successful in all con￾trol frozen slide samples, regardless of the post-fixative 
used. Intensity of staining was greatest in the ethanol 
post-fixed slides and most attenuated in the formalin 
post-fixed slides. The preservation of tissue morpho￾logy was poorest in those slides which received no 
post-fixation, marginal in the slides post-fixed with 
acetone, and reasonably good in slides post-fixed with 
ethanol or formalin. The best combination of staining 
and morphology preservation was obtained with post￾fixation of the frozen tissue slides with chilled 95% 
ethanol for 1 min. 
Examination for GGT staining of ethanol post-fixed 
slides from the control fish revealed intense staining of 
the enzyme marker around the renal tubular lumen 
and in the epithelial cell brush border (Fig. 8A). Slides 
from the treated fish showed no staining for GGT 
activity in the tubules, and disruption of the tubular 
morphology (Fig. 8B). Tissue samples stained with 
H&E revealed severe necrosis and sloughing of renal 
tubular epithelium in the treated fish in comparison to 
the normal renal appearance of the control fish. 
Expt 3: staining for BrDU uptake 
Immunohistochemical staining of the treated fish 
tissues for BrDU uptake revealed an increase in cellu￾lar replication in various parts of the kidney over 
normal control levels (Fig. 9A). At 4 d following in￾jection, replication was evident primarily in the large 
terminal collecting ducts (Fig. 9B). At 7 d, some activity 
in the collecting ducts was still evident but activity was 
also prominent in flattened epithelial cells on the pre￾0.25 0.5 1 2 3 4 7 14 21 28 35 42 Days Post-Injection Fig. 7.

By 14 d following injection, cellular division in the collecting ducts was greatly decreased, but divi- sion among tubular epithelial cells was increased. Division was also evident in clusters of cells identified on H&E stained sections as developing nephrons (Fig. 9D). Some clusters of basophilic staining cells were noted in both control and treated tissues which did not stain for BrDU. These were presumed to be inactive precursors to new nephrons. DISCUSSION Consistent with evidence found in other fish species (Chamie & Reimschuessel 1994, Reimschuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994)' tilapia were shown to be susceptible to nephrotoxic injury from exposure to gentamicin. A single injection of 5 mg kg-', less than double the recommended therapeutic dose of 3 mg kg-' (Stoskopf et al. 1986), was sufficient to induce marked necrosis and a low level of mortality in this species. A single injection of 25 mg kg-' (approxi- mately 8 times the recommended therapeutic dose) produced severe necrosis of the renal tubular epithe- lium and significant mortality. Tilapia are thus lethally more sensitive to the nephrotoxic effects of gentamicin than are the goldfish, in which a dose of 50 mg kg-' did not produce significant mortality (Reimschuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994). Mild and highly variable levels of interstitial edema and tubular dilation, 2 signs commonly associated with renal injury, were evident across all groups in this investigation. Only the high dose group, on Day 2,

(A) 300x, control, 3 d following IP injection with sterile water. Note the dense staining around the tubular lumen coinciding with 
the brush border of the proximal tubular epithelium. (B) 300x, 3 d following injection of 25 mg kg-' gentamicin. Note the loss 
of staining and the degree of morphological disruption compared with the control 
showed sufficiently severe edema to be determined 
significant from the background levels of edematous 
change. This finding might be partially explained by 
the presence of mild hypoxic renal injury as a result 
of the method of euthanasia. The anesthetic agent 
MS-222, utilized for euthanasia in this experiment, has 
been demonstrated to cause acute, severe hypoxia at 
narcotic doses (Iwama et al. 1989). This hypoxia may 
have resulted in mild, variable, background levels of 
interstitial edema and tubular dilation in all of the 
groups of this experiment. 
The high dose group had the highest incidence and 
seventy of necrosis with the peak necrotic changes 
occurring at Day 2 following injection. Peak necrosis 
was delayed in the low dose group until Days 4 to 7, 
and never reached the degree noted in the high dose 
group. The dramatic decrease in necrosis after peak 
levels were reached (Fig. 5) resulted from the con~plete 
obliteration of the renal tubular epithelium, which left 
denuded tubular basement membranes and no further 
cells to undergo active cellular necrosis. Regeneration 
along the basement membrane closely followed peak 
necrosis. The denuded basement membranes were 
rapidly, if sparsely, populated by flattened, basophilic 
epithelial cells. The low dose group had a low degree 
of epithelial regeneration that was consistent with the 
milder degree of tubular necrosis. The high dose group 
showed a high degree of regeneration that peaked at 
Day 4, closely following the peak in necrosis seen at 
Day 2, and continued through Day 21 following expo￾sure. Regeneration thus appeared to begin shortly 
after peak necrosis and continue for at least 2 wk 
before returning to background levels. 
Nephroneogenesis developed more slowly than 
necrotic or regenerative processes, first exceeding 
background levels and simultaneously peaking at 
Day 14 following injection. A greater number of new 
nephrons developed in the high dose group than in 
the low dose group, again consistent with the relative 
degree of necrosis. The developing nephrons seen at 
14 d were relatively mature, showing rudimentary 
glomeruli and tubules. There also appeared to be a 
trend for decreased nephroneogenesis during the 
period in which active necrosis and repair took place. 
A moderate level of nephroneogenic activity was 
present in all groups at 0.25 and 0.5 d, followed by a 
decrease in activity in both high and low dose groups 
(in some cases a significant decrease from the overall 
group level) between Days 1 and 4, and then a return 
to moderate activity following the peak nephroneo-

genesis at 14 d (Fig. 7). This trend may indicate that 
nephrotoxic injury suppresses the normal background 
level of nephroneogenesis in this species, and then 
stimulates a responsive burst of new nephron develop￾ment once active necrosis has ceased and regeneration 
along the tubules is under way. 
GGT is commonly found in the brush border of renal 
proximal tubules (Rutenburg et al. 1969, Reimschues￾sel et al. 1989). Loss of GGT staining was positively 
correlated with the histopathological appearance of 
tubular necrosis in gentamicin-treated fish, lending 
strong evidence that the proximal tubule is the target 
of gentamicin nephrotoxicity in this species. The sen￾sitivity of tilapian GGT to inactivation by formalin 
has not been reported in GGT from goldfish (Reim￾schuessel et al. 1989) and may indicate structural 
differences in this enzyme in goldfish and tilapia. 
This investigation demonstrated that the tilapian 
kidney responds to nephrotoxic insult with regenera￾tion of epithelial cells along the tubule and new 
nephron development in a manner similar to other fish 
species (Cuppage & Tate 1967, Reirnschuessel et al. 
1990, 1993, Reimschuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous 
et al. 1994). The time course for regeneration along the 
basement membrane appeared to be similar in Expts 1 
& 3 of this study with regeneration commencing in 
both by Day 4 and continuing beyond Day 14. Expt 3 
utilized BrDU uptake as a marker for cellular replica￾tion and demonstrated the chronology of the process 
of epithelial regeneration. Cellular division began in 
the collecting ducts shortly after nephrotoxic insult, 
progressed to regenerative cells migrating along the 
denuded basement membrane, and later tapered off in 
the collecting ducts while continuing in the cells lining 
the damaged tubules. This chronology may indicate 
that the collecting ducts are the source of replicat￾ing cells for repopulation of the proximal tubular 
epithelium. 
A marked difference was noted in the quality of 
nephroneogenesis in fish from Expt 3 compared to that 
in Expt 1. The developing nephrons found at Day 14 in 
Expt 3 were more immature, appearing as little more 
than clusters of rapidly dividing cells (Fig. 9D), while 
those in Expt 1 were more complex (Fig. 2D). This 
apparent disparity in the quality of new nephron 
development may be explained by the fact that the fish 
utilized in Expt 1 were less mature than those in 
Expt 3. A certain background level of new nephron 
development is probably normal in fish that have not 
reached maturity. Immature fish may respond to 
nephrotoxic insult with new nephron development 
more rapidly than adults because of this background 
level of ongoing nephroneogenesis. Future investiga￾tion on the effect of fish age or size upon the rate of 
new nephron development is indicated. Investigations 
using electron microscopy to document the ultrastruc￾tural changes involved in nephron regeneration and 
neogenesis would also be interesting. 
This investigation demonstrated that Oreochromis 
nilotica is more sensitive to the nephrotoxic effects of 
gentamicin than other previously examined non￾tilapian species in that the tilapia experienced nearly 
30 % mortality at 25 mg kg-' gentamicin whereas gold￾fish experience no mortality at the same dose (Reim￾schuessel & Williams 1994, Rokokous et al. 1994). This 
has important implications for therapeutic use of gen￾tamicin in tilapian fishes. Dosing must be approached 
cautiously if toxicity and mortality are to be avoided. 
Although tilapia are able to regenerate injured tubular 
epithelium and generate new nephrons in response to 
renal injury, acute renal damage may result in mortality 
before the regenerative responses can be initiated. A 
tilapian fish that is otherwise compromised by stresses 
such as bacterial infection, crowding, or poor water 
quality may be less well equipped to repair tubular 
injury resulting from the nephrotoxic insult of amino￾glycoside therapy and thus be more likely to succumb. 
Such stresses are particularly prevalent among tilapia 
in commercial aquaculture. Of further note, all nephro￾toxic injury induced in this investigation resulted from 
a single dose exposure, while most clinical therapy 
involves repetitive dosing regimes. Clearly, further 
investigation on the effects of repetitive dosing of 
gentamicin on the severity of nephrotoxicity in tilapia 
is warranted, as it would be helpful in determining the 
suitability of the clinical use of gentamicin antibac￾terial therapy in commercial tilapia culture.
