Abstract
Background: Previously, we have demonstrated that mucociliary clearance (MCC) is diminished within the first months after
surgery in lung transplant patients and the explanation for the reduction in MCC is unknown. We hypothesized that chronic
treatment with a commonly prescribed regimen of immunosuppressive drugs significantly impairs MCC. We tested this
hypothesis in a murine model of lung transplantation.
Methods: Fifteen C57BL/6 mice underwent vagotomy on the right side to simulate denervation associated with lung
transplantation in humans. For 6 days, seven mice (controls) were intraperitoneally injected with three 100 mL doses of
phosphate buffered saline and eight mice (immunosuppressed) were injected with three 100 mL injections of tacrolimus
(1 mg/kg), mycophenolate mofetil (30 mg/kg), and prednisone (2 mg/kg) once daily. Then, mice inhaled the radioisotope
99mtechnetium and underwent gamma camera imaging of their lungs for 6.5 hrs. Counts in the right lung at 1–1.5 hrs and
at 6–6.5 hrs were first background-corrected and then decay-corrected to time 0 counts. Decay-corrected counts were then
divided by time 0 counts. Retention at each time point was subtracted from 1.00 and multiplied by 100% to obtain percent
removed by mucociliary clearance.
Results: Although there was a slowing of MCC at 1–1.5 hrs for the immunosuppressed mice, there was no statistical
difference in MCC measured at 1–1.5 hrs for the two groups of mice. At 6–6.5 hrs, MCC was significantly slower in the
immunosuppressed mice, compared to controls, with 7.7865.9% cleared versus 23.01611.7% cleared, respectively
(p = 0.006).
Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that chronic treatment with immunosuppressive medications significantly
slows MCC in vagotomized C57BL/6 mice. These findings could shed light on why MCC is reduced in lung transplant
patients whose lungs are denervated during surgery and who are chronically treated with immunosuppressive drugs post
surgery.

Introduction
Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a vital pulmonary defense
mechanism providing protection in the lower and upper airways
against inhaled pathogens and irritants. Insoluble agents that
deposit in the airway mucus are removed within hours by the
MCC apparatus. Impairment to this defense mechanism leads to
prolonged exposure to irritants, bacteria and viruses, the de￾velopment of infections and subsequent re-injury to the MCC
apparatus [1].
Previously, we have demonstrated that MCC is diminished
within the first months after surgery in lung transplant patients and
does not improve for at least 12 months thereafter [2]. There are
several aspects of the lung transplantation process that might
account for the observed reduction in MCC in patients. Lung
transplantation requires a period of anesthesia with volatile agents
such as isoflurane. Similar agents (halothane and enflurane) have
been shown to impair MCC in the short-term (hours) in canine
models [3–4]. However, the depressant effects of these volatile
anesthetic agents on cilia [5] and on tracheal flow appear to be
reversible [4]. This reversibility suggests that mucus clearance
would be restored post-operatively in the absence of additional
factors. Devascularization, as measured by ischemic time, may be
another causative factor of the observed reduction in MCC
following lung transplantation. However, results from a previous

study in our laboratory showed that ischemic time was not
associated with a reduction in MCC in the transplanted lung of
individuals who had undergone transplantation [2]. The reduction
in MCC also could be due to loss of vagal control in the lungs.
During transplantation, the lung is denervated and the nerves are
not reconnected. Nevertheless, we found in a previous study in
mice that denervation did not affect basal MCC, suggesting that
denervation alone does not account for the observed reduction in
MCC in lung transplant patients [6]. The reduction in MCC also
could be the result of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs to
prevent rejection. The most commonly prescribed combination of
drugs includes tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and
prednisone [7]. Some of these drugs are known to alter Ca2+
fluxes, which have direct effects on ciliary beat frequency and
MCC [8–9].
In this pilot study, we hypothesized that chronic treatment with
this common regimen of immunosuppressive drugs would
significantly impair MCC in mice that are unilaterally vagoto￾mized, compared to placebo treated mice. If this combination
reduces MCC in a mouse model, it could have important
translational implications toward understanding the mechanism
behind reduced clearance in patients who undergo lung trans￾plantation.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Experiments were performed according to animal protocol
MO07M147, which was approved by the Animal Care Use
Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Mouse Cohorts
Mucociliary clearance was compared in 8–10 week old, male
C57BL/6 mice that were unilaterally vagotomized on the right
side and either treated with the three-drug cocktail of immuno￾suppression medications, or placebo. Animals were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).
Vagotomy
Vagotomy was accomplished by transection of the right vagus,
as described previously [6]. Prior to surgery, mice were weighed
and anesthetized intraperitoneally with 100 mg/g ketamine and
16 mg/g xylazine. While anesthetized, a medial cervical incision
was made and a 1–2 cm portion of the vagus was exposed, excised,
and ligated such that a .0.5 cm gap was established between the
proximal and distal nerve stumps. The nerve stumps were tightly
ligated to prevent reanastomosis of the vagus during the recovery
period. Mucociliary clearance was measured 7 days after this
surgery and the gap between the nerve stumps was in effect at the
time of those measurements.
Treatment
Mice were divided into either control, or immunosuppressed
groups. Eight mice (immunosuppressed) received doses of
tacrolimus (Prograf, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL)
(1 mg/kg), MMF (CellCept, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Boulder,
CO) (30 mg/kg), and prednisone (2 mg/kg) dissolved in PBS/1%
DMSO in 3 separate 100 mL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. In
previous protocols using murine models, other investigators have
shown that i.p. injection of these dosages results in positive
immunosuppressive effects with limited toxicity [10–12].
Drugs were combined and administered as a cocktail instead of
administering each individually. This is because previous studies
have shown that drug interactions in combination delivery are not
equivalent to the effects of the linear addition of the combination’s
constituents [13].
Seven mice served as controls and received three separate
100 mL i.p. injections of PBS/1% DMSO solution. All mice were
vagotomized on day 1 and given daily treatment for 6 days. MCC
was quantified 7 days after vagotomy.
As a gauge of general health during the treatment period, each
mouse was weighed daily and the final percent weight difference
between day 1 and 7 was compared for the two groups.
Oropharyngeal Aspiration
Mucociliary clearance was quantified using a non-invasive,
oropharyngeal aspiration procedure described previously [14–15].
Both groups of mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of
ketamine (100 mg/g) and xylazine (16 mg/g) and suspended from
their upper incisors at a 45u incline. Then, one 50 ml aliquot of
normal saline containing 50–70 mCi of the radioisotope 99mtech￾netium-labeled sulfur colloid (99mTc-SC) was introduced into the
distal part of the oropharynx and aspirated.
Gamma Scintigraphy Imaging Procedure
Mouse lungs were imaged immediately after aspiration (time 0)
and at 1–1.5 hrs and 6–6.5 hrs, thereafter, using an X-SPECT
gamma camera (Gamma Medica, Inc. Northridge, CA) with
pinhole collimation.
The effects of the anesthesia lasted approximately 45 min to
1 hr, so all mice were awake for most of the time between the first
and subsequent imaging procedures. Both groups of mice were re￾anesthetized a few minutes before the 1–1.5 hr and the 6–6.5 hr
image was obtained. Only a quarter of the original dose was used
at the 1–1.5 hr time point, since the mice had not fully recovered
from the time 0 anesthetic prior to imaging.
We analyzed images from the 1–1.5 hr and the 6–6.5 hr time
points because the first phase of mucociliary clearance of insoluble
particles from the respiratory tract (clearance from ciliated
airways) continues for between 20–24 hrs in animals and man,
with half-times between 3 and 12 hrs [14,16–17]. Based on this
information, we reasoned that we would be able to detect the
greatest signal in terms of MCC from the ciliated airways by
quantifying MCC over approximately 6 hrs.
Quantification of Mucociliary Clearance
Counts in the right lung at 1–1.5 hrs and at 6–6.5 hrs were first
background-corrected and then decay-corrected to time 0 counts.
Decay-corrected counts were then divided by time 0 counts.
Retention at each time point was subtracted from 1.00 and
multiplied by 100% to obtain percent removed by mucociliary
clearance. Equations (1) and (2) summarize how MCC was
determined:
Retention~Background- and Decay-Corrected
Counts at Time Xð Þ7Counts at Time 0 ð1Þ
MCC~ð Þ 1:0{Retention | 100% ð2Þ
The left lung was not included in the analysis because
interference/noise from the gastrointestinal tract made it difficult
to acquire meaningful counts from the left lung [6].

Quantification of Aerosol Distribution
It is well known that the site of deposition of the radiotracer can
affect MCC. For example, insoluble radiolabeled particles that
deposit in ciliated airways will be cleared from the respiratory tract
with half-times between 3–12 hrs in both animals and man
[14,16–17]. Removal from non-ciliated lung regions does not
usually occur by MCC mechanisms and requires more than
24 hrs. To avoid the possibility of differences in MCC due to
differences in regional lung deposition, we analyzed the initial
aerosol distribution within the right lung of all mice in this study. A
detailed explanation as to how distribution was determined is
found in Bhashyam et al. [6]. Briefly, the right lung image of each
animal was divided into 9 smaller squares. The square that was
most central and closest to the trachea was identified as the central
region (C). The remaining squares were collectively identified as
the peripheral region (P). See Figure 1, Bhashyam et al. [6].
Distribution was quantified in terms of a central to peripheral ratio
(C:P ratio), as described previously [6]. High C:P ratios indicated
greater deposition of the radiotracer in the large airways. Low C:P
ratios indicated greater deposition in the smaller airways and
alveoli. This method of quantifying aerosol deposition within the
lung has its limitations. This is mainly due to the fact that large
airways overlap smaller airways and alveoli in this 2D represen￾tation. Nevertheless, based on anatomy, we assumed that the
central region in the 2D image contained more large airways than
smaller airways and the peripheral region contained more small
airways and alveoli than large airways.
Qualitative Analyses of Histological Changes in Lung
Qualitative histological evaluations were performed to identify
possible differences in treated and untreated lungs that could
account for the observed changes in MCC. A separate cohort of
five immunosuppressed mice and five control mice were eutha￾nized and the excised lungs and trachea were inflated with
warmed (50–55uC) 1% low melt agarose at 30 cm H2O, as
described previously [15]. The inflation pressure was measured
continuously until the agarose started to gel. Lungs were fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The lung and trachea were
then paraffin-embedded, cut into five-micron sections and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). H&E sections of trachea and
large bronchi were qualitatively evaluated for the presence of
ciliated epithelial cells at 100 X and 40 X magnification.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on mouse lung tissue to
determine possible differences in PAS and iNOS expression.
Sections were prepared from the same separate cohort of five
immuonsuppressed mice and five control mice as described above
under Qualitative Analysis of Histological Changes in Lung.
PAS Expression. Formalin-fixed lungs were embedded in
paraffin and sectioned to five microns. The tissue was depar￾affinized and hydrated before staining. Sections were stained in
0.5% Periodic Acid and Schiff’s Reagent for 5 minutes and 15
minutes, respectively. After counterstaining with hematoxylin,
sections were rinsed with water, dehydrated and mounted.
Prepared sections were qualitatively evaluated at 20X magnifica￾tion for PAS expression.
iNOS Expression. Lung sections were deparaffinized and
rehydrated with water. Antigens were retrieved by heating the
sections in BorgDecloaketRTU (Biocare Medical; Concord, CA)
for 10 min. at 95uC. After antigen retrieval, non-specific binding
was blocked using Ultra V Block (UltraVision Detection System
from Thermo Scientific; Fremont, CA) for 10 min. Then, slides
were incubated in a humidity chamber with primary antibody
from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA) at 1:400 dilution for 1 hr. at
room temperature. As negative controls, adjacent slides were
incubated in normal rabbit serum. After two buffer washes, slides
were incubated for 10 min. with biotinylated Goat Snti-polyvalent
(UltraVision Detection System), followed by a buffer wash and
incubated for 10 min. in Streptavidin Peroxidase (UltraVision
Detection System). After a buffer wash, staining of interest was
developed with DAB chromagen (Dako; Carpinteria, CA) and
counterstained with Fast Green (Sigma; St.Louis, MO). Slides
were then dehydrated and mounted with Cytoseal (Thermo

hours, but differences in MCC were not statistically significant. Mucociliary clearance was statistically significantly slower in the drug-treated mice,
compared to controls, at 6–6.5 hours (p = 0.006).

Scientific). Prepared sections were qualitatively evaluated at 20X
magnification for iNOS expression.
Statistical Methods
Data are presented as mean 6 standard deviation for MCC
from the right lung. A non-parametric, two-sided Mann-Whitney
U test was used to compare MCC at 1–1.5 hrs, MCC at 6–6.5 hrs,
C:P ratio, and percent weight change in the control and
immunosuppressed groups of mice. P-values #0.05 indicated
a statistically significant difference between comparisons. Pair-wise
comparisons were performed using the Statistics Toolbox in
MATLAB version 7.7.0 (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA).
Results
Effect of Immunosuppression on Body Weight
Before surgery, control animals weighed 25.7462.11 grams and
immunosuppressed animals weighed 24.1061.76 grams. Follow￾ing treatment, mice in both groups had lost weight. On day 7,
controls weighed 23.8462.83 grams and immunosuppressed
animals weighed 21.9461.15 grams. However, there was no
statistically significant difference between the groups, with percent
change in body weight averaging 2865% and 2966% in the
control and immunosuppressed mice, respectively.
Effect of Immunosuppression on MCC
At 1–1.5 hrs post aspiration, MCC from the right lung of the
immunosuppressed mice averaged 3.8165.66%, which was not
statistically different from control mice with 7.5869.20%
(Figure 1). By 6–6.5 hours post aspiration, MCC from the right
lung was statistically significantly reduced in the immunosup￾pressed animals compared to control animals, averaging
7.7865.9% and 23.01611.7%, for the two groups, respectively
(p = 0.006) (Figure 1).
Distribution of Radiotracer: C:P Ratio
Regional distribution of radiotracer within the right lung was
not statistically different for the two groups of mice. The C:P ratio
averaged 1.6060.36 and 2.2660.90 in control and immunosup￾pressed mice, respectively (p = 0.105).
Effect of Immunosuppression on Lung Histology
H&E sections from the trachea of a control and immunosup￾pressed mouse are shown in Figure 2. Qualitatively, there was no
difference in the presence of ciliated epithelial cells observed in the
H&E sections of the trachea at either 100 X, or 40 X,
magnification for the control (Figures 2A and 2B) and the drug￾treated mice (Figures 2C and 2D), respectively. The presence of
cilia decreased significantly in the H&E sections for the bronchi at
both magnifications in the control and drug-treated mice (sections
not shown), making a qualitative comparison impossible.
PAS Expression. Qualitatively, both the drug-treated ani￾mals and control mice appeared to have similar PAS staining in
the seromucous cells of the tracheal glands (Figure 3), suggesting
that these cells remained in tact despite chronic treatment.
iNOS Expression. iNOS staining was qualitatively increased
in the bronchial epithelium of five of the five drug-treated mice
(Figure 4). Minimal iNOS staining was observed in five of the five
mice that were not treated with immunosuppressive agents
(Figure 4).
Discussion
This study was designed as a pilot study to answer a basic
question: Does one of the most common immunosuppressive drug
combinations that is currently administered to lung transplant
patients have a detrimental effect on mucociliary clearance? In
a previous study in lung transplant patients, we reported that
MCC is slowed after surgery and remains impaired for at least
one-year, thereafter [2]. Although the mechanism for the
impairment is unknown, we hypothesized that chronic treatment
with commonly prescribed immunosuppressive drugs could be one
explanation. We tested this hypothesis in a vagotomized murine
model. At 1–1.5 hrs after inhalation of the radioisotopic marker,
there was a trend towards slower clearance in the drug-treated
mice, compared to controls. However, those differences in MCC
were not statistically significant. By 6–6.5 hrs, MCC was

statistically significantly slower in the immunosuppressed mice,
compared to controls. The lack of statistical significance in MCC
at 1–1.5 hrs was likely due to greater variability in the
measurement at that time point. The coefficients of variation for
MCC in the immunosuppressed and control mice at 1–1.5 hrs
were 1.49 and 1.21, respectively. This is in contrast to the much
lower coefficients of variation observed at 6–6.5 hrs, with 0.76 and
0.51, respectively. It is unknown why there was greater variability
in the MCC measurements after 1–1.5 hrs, compared to 6–
6.5 hrs.
We chose not to include non-vagotomized animals in these
studies because human lungs are denervated following trans￾plantation and denervated mice chronically treated with immu￾nosuppressive drugs seemed the best model for translating our
findings to humans, which is our goal. Our findings do not rule out
the possibility that treatment with immunosuppressive drugs could
affect MCC in non-denervated animals and in humans who have
not undergone lung transplantation [18–19]. For this reason,
a group of non-vagotomized mice would be interesting to look at
in future studies in order to determine the potential impact of
chronic immunosuppression on MCC in transplant populations
that don’t undergo denervation (i.e. other solid organ trans￾plantation patients).
Mice were treated with a cocktail of tacrolimus, which inhibits
calcineurin, MMF, which impairs B- and T-cell proliferation, and
prednisone, which prevents acute rejection [7]. These drugs were
chosen to emulate one of the most common regimens currently
used to treat lung transplantation patients. Doses for each of the
drugs were based on previous efficacy in terms of reducing, or
eliminating, acute rejection in other murine models [10–12].
In terms of translating the doses used in this murine model to
doses used to treat patients after lung transplantation, clinical
doses for MMF range between 1 and 1.5 g daily and prednisone
ranges between 250–1000 mg daily [20]. Assuming an average
human weight of 70 kg, the doses of MMF and prednisone that
were administered in our study are similar to clinical doses for
patients who have undergone transplantation. The dose of
tacrolimus that was used in this murine model was significantly
higher than the dose used in humans, which ranges between 0.1–
0.2 mg/kg [20]. We used a higher dose of tacrolimus because
previous investigators have shown that dosages of 0.5 mg/kg or
lower are sub-therapeutic in mice, while higher doses (i.e. 2 mg/
kg) are therapeutic based on trough serum levels [10].
One explanation for the reduced MCC in the immunosup￾pressed mice could be a reduction in mucus transport due to a loss
of ciliated epithelial cells. Molecular mechanisms associated with

prednisone and MMF have been shown to affect epithelial
integrity [21]. However, qualitative histological examination of the
airway sections, as described, did not reveal any difference in the
presence of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea of the
immunosuppressed mice, compared to controls (Figure 2A–D).
These results should not be surprising since, contrary to what is
found in other species, the majority (50–60%) of cells in murine
airway epithelia is non-ciliated Clara cells [22] and ciliated cells
often occur in scattered patches [23]. Thus, there may be too few
ciliated cells to observe differences based on a qualitative analysis.
Other, more quantitative, histological analyses that were beyond
the scope of this pilot study might reveal differences.
PAS staining results suggested intact seromucous cells in the
tracheal glands of the chronically drug-treated animals (Figure 3).
It is unknown if there were any differences between other mucous
producing cells, since these analyses were performed retrospec￾tively and were not part of the original study design.
It is interesting that, qualitatively, the airways of the five drug￾treated animals showed significantly greater amounts of iNOS
than the five control animals (Figure 4). The explanation for this
difference is unknown. However, iNOS can be induced in
macrophages in response to stress such as drug toxicity or
infection [24] and, in our model, it appears that increased iNOS is
associated with impaired MCC. Nitric oxide (NO) levels were not
quantified in these animals. Therefore, it is not known if this
histological finding of an increase in iNOS in the airways of the
treated animals was associated with increased levels of NO. Future
studies could further examine the relationship between increased
iNOS and decreased MCC in this model.
Daily administration of the immunosuppression drug cocktail
may have altered the general health of the drug-treated mice and
this may have affected MCC in some unknown way. However, we
were unable to discern any difference in the overall health of the
two groups of mice. The drug-treated animals did not appear
lethargic and they did not lose more weight than the control
animals.
Differences in the initial deposition of the radioisotope such that
the marker was systematically deposited in more proximal airways
in the control mice and more distally in the immunosuppressed
animals might account for the faster MCC observed at 6–6.5 hrs
in the control group. However, analysis of the deposition
distribution in each of the mice showed it trending in the opposite
direction. C:P ratios were higher in the immunosuppressed mice,
compared to control mice. Since higher C:P ratios indicate more
proximal deposition of the radiomarker, this trend should have
resulted in an increase in MCC in the immunosuppressed mice,
compared to controls. However, this was not the case. Thus, it is
unlikely that a systematic difference in the distribution of the
radiolabeled aerosol particles was responsible for the observed
differences in MCC for the two groups of animals.
Another possible explanation for our observation of depressed
MCC in the vagotomized, immunosuppressed mice is the
combined negative molecular effects of tacrolimus, MMF and
prednisone. Molecular control of MCC is an intricate process that
is well-described in a recent review by Salathe [9]. In particular,
changes in baseline calcium ion concentration can modulate
ciliary beat frequency (CBF), which in turn can increase, or
decrease, MCC [9]. Immunosuppressive medications like tacroli￾mus have the potential to alter this ionic concentration.
Tacrolimus suppresses the FKBP-4 gene which produces the
FK506 binding protein (FKBP) in human cell cultures. As a result,
lowered FKBP levels inhibit Ca++ oscillations, which experimen￾tally reduce CBF [25]. In addition, tacrolimus decreases Ca++
content in thapsigargin-sensitive stores, suggesting that even

partial depletion of Ca++ levels causes an inhibition of Ca++
oscillations that could reduce CBF and, consequently, MCC
[8,25]. Future studies that determine the oscillations in the Ca++
influx, the levels of CBF, the expression of the FKBP-4 gene, as
well as the levels of FKBP and cGMP in the lungs of these animals
could provide much needed insight as to why MCC is depressed in
these vagotomized, immunosuppressed mice.
Prednisone, another agent used in this experiment, could also
depress MCC in our mouse model. Working with patients with
sarcoidosis, Hasani et al. [26] demonstrated that patients who
were using inhaled corticosteroids demonstrated a greater degree
of impairment in mucociliary clearance than patients who were
either in remission, or were receiving oral corticosteroid therapy.
They concluded that their findings raised the question of possible
consequences of long-term inhaled immunosuppressive therapy on
mucociliary clearance.
It was beyond the scope of this study to examine the individual
effects of the drugs that make up the typical immunosuppressive
drug cocktail on mucus clearance in our mouse model mice.
Future studies in which the three drugs are administered
separately, or in alternate combinations, could determine if there
are differences between the drugs, or drug combinations, in terms
of their effect on MCC, and if one drug is more potent than
another in reducing MCC in this animal model.
The notion that immunosuppressive drugs may have impaired
CBF in the mice in these studies is supported by our previous
findings in humans who underwent lung transplantation. In those
studies, we found that MCC in the transplanted lung was
significantly reduced after surgery and treatment with immuno￾suppressive drugs. However, the impairment was not permanent.
Mucociliary clearance was immediately restored to normal levels
following inhalation of 4 puffs of the beta2 adrenergic-agonist
albuterol from a pressurized metered dose inhaler [2]. These
findings suggest that lung transplantation leaves the cilia functional
and intact, but the immunosuppressive drugs inhibit or reduce the
Ca++ signal and, thereby, reduce CBF. In humans, this inhibition
of CBF appears to be overcome with inhalation of a beta2
adrenergic-agonist. It was beyond the scope of these experiments
to determine if a beta2 adrenergic-agonist would also rescue MCC
in the immunosuppressed mice.
Conclusions
Results from these experiments indicate that chronic treatment
with a commonly used cocktail of immunosuppressive medications
significantly slows MCC in vagotomized C57BL/6 mice. These
findings could shed light on why MCC is slowed in lung transplant
patients, as we have reported previously (2), since these patients
are chronically treated with similar immunosuppressive drugs post
surgery. Future studies are needed to determine if one drug is
more potent than another in reducing MCC in this animal model.
