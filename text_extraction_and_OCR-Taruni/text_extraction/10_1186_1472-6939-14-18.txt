Bariatric surgery for obese children and
adolescents: a review of the moral challenges
Bjørn Hofmann1,2
Abstract
Background: Bariatric surgery for children and adolescents is becoming widespread. However, the evidence is still
scarce and of poor quality, and many of the patients are too young to consent. This poses a series of moral
challenges, which have to be addressed both when considering bariatric surgery introduced as a health care
service and when deciding for treatment for young individuals. A question based (Socratic) approach is applied to
reveal underlying moral issues that can be relevant to an open and transparent decision making process.
Discussion: A wide range of moral issues with bariatric surgery for children and adolescents is identified in the
literature. There is a moral imperative to help obese minors avoiding serious health problems, but there is little high
quality evidence on safety, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness for bariatric surgery in this group. Lack of maturity and
family relations poses a series of challenges with autonomy, informed consent, assent, and assessing the best
interest of children and adolescents. Social aspects of obesity, such as medicalization, prejudice, and discrimination,
raise problems with justice and trust in health professionals. Conceptual issues, such as definition of obesity and
treatment end-points, present moral problems. Hidden interests of patients, parents, professionals, industry, and
society need to be revealed.
Summary: Performing bariatric surgery for obese children and adolescents in order to discipline their behavior
warrants reflection and caution. More evidence on outcomes is needed to be able to balance benefits and risks, to
provide information for a valid consent or assent, and to advise minors and parents.
Keywords: Bariatric surgery, Children, Adolescents, Ethics, Moral
Background
Obesity has become a pressing health problem world￾wide [1], not only for adults but, also for children and
adolescents [2-4]. It has been characterized as an epi￾demic, a surge and a crisis [2,4-8]. Obesity in children
and adolescents is associated with serious health conse￾quences, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin re￾sistance/diabetes, fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep
apnea, and psychosocial complications [4,9].
Even though prevention of obesity in children and ad￾olescents has obtained substantial attention, the evi￾dence on effectiveness of preventive measures is often of
poor quality [4,7,10-12]. As the number of obese chil￾dren and adolescents increases, there is a push for action
[2-4]. Several treatment options are available for young
obese persons [7,13-19]. Life-style interventions and
other non-pharmacological treatments are often consid￾ered to be the first option but, such interventions have
variable outcomes [10,14,20]. Pharmacological treatment
appears to have modest effectiveness when combined
with lifestyle interventions but, is associated with more
adverse effects than lifestyle interventions alone [20,21].
Several surgical procedures are available for children and
adolescents but, long term effects from high quality
studies are scarce [19,20].
The enthusiasm and apparent success of bariatric sur￾gery in adults has kindled an interesting debate on
performing bariatric surgery in children and adoles￾cents. Bariatric surgery for children as young as 5 years
old has been reported [22]. However, children and ado￾lescents are still developing, both physically and men￾tally [14,23-25], they may have reduced competency to
consent [26,27], and bariatric surgery may change their
life in a substantial way.

The pressing question in this debate is whether we
should normalize bariatric surgery for children and adoles￾cents. There is an imperative to help obese minors to
avoid serious health problems in the best possible way, but
the lack of high quality evidence on safety, outcomes, and
cost-effectiveness for bariatric surgery in this patient
group makes it difficult to do so. Moreover, lack of matur￾ity and strong family relationships pose a series of chal￾lenges related to autonomy and informed consent/assent.
Social aspects of obesity, such as medicalization, prejudice,
and discrimination, raise problems with justice and trust
in health professionals. Conceptual issues, such as the def￾inition of obesity and treatment end-points, are morally
demanding along with the handling and balancing of in￾terests of patients, parents, professionals, industry, and so￾ciety. These, and many other moral challenges, will be
presented and discussed in this article. They are important
in order to make open and transparent decisions on bar￾iatric surgery for children and adolescents.
Bariatric surgery refers to a variety of surgical procedures,
including gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve
gastrectomy, and duodenal switch, and includes both open
and laparoscopic procedures [25,26]. Due to restricted
space (and limited clinical evidence), this article will not
analyze each surgical procedure in detail, but discuss moral
issues that are common to the various procedures in bariat￾ric surgery which, call for attention. Moreover, there are
significant differences between young children and old ado￾lescents and there is substantial variability in maturity
within the same age group. Nevertheless, many moral ques￾tions are common. When there are specific differences be￾tween children and adolescents or special age groups are
addressed, this will be made explicit in the text.
This article presents an overview of the many moral
challenges that exist with bariatric surgery for children
and adolescents. Corresponding reviews for obese adults
already exist [28-30] but, children and adolescents are
special and deserve distinct attention.
Methods
To identify the moral issues at stake with bariatric surgery
for children and adolescents, a question based (Socratic)
approach was applied. A series of morally relevant ques￾tions are posed to highlight overt and covert value issues
with regard to a medical intervention. The approach is de￾scribed in detail elsewhere [31-33] and is implemented in
a core model of Health Technology Assessment [34-36]. It
is used for a wide range of health technologies, including
surgery [28,29,37,38].
The aim of the approach is to highlight the moral is￾sues in an open and transparent manner by revealing
underlying conceptions and hidden presumptions. It
does not analyze bariatric surgery for children and ado￾lescents within a particular ethical framework and does
not provide specific recommendations. The objective is
to inform decision makers (on various levels) about
values, viewpoints, and arguments which appear to be
important for actual decisions in context.
The literature search
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science,
Eurethics, Bioethics Research Library at Georgetown Uni￾versity, BELIT, and SIBIL was searched for systematic re￾views, primary studies, reports and books. Search words
were: obesity, obese, overweight, child*, adolescen*,
pediatric*, young*, teen*, youth*, ethic*, moral*, patient au￾tonomy, consent, assent, conflict, interest, self determin￾ation, health disparities, discrimination, mental capacity,
mental competency, parental, perceptive discrimination,
and beneficence. The search was performed in October
2012. Titles and abstracts were screened for morally rele￾vant issues. Selected references were assessed for content
and clarity of presentation. Articles only mentioning that
there are moral challenges, but without explaining or ana￾lyzing them, were excluded. Relevant references found in
the reviewed literature, were added.
Results
The literature search resulted in 1177 references which
were processed according to Figure 1.
How the morally relevant questions are addressed, and
the related arguments, are presented thematically in the
following sections.
Beneficence and bariatric surgery
Does bariatric surgery benefit children and adolescents?
What are the long term outcomes? What is the efficacy,
effectiveness, and efficiency of bariatric surgery? Utilitar￾ian assessments of bariatric surgery for young people are
difficult as high quality knowledge on benefits is scarce
[39]. Knowledge from uncontrolled series’ from selected
centers indicates that bariatric surgery may be beneficial
[40], but, evidence on important outcome measures is
lacking [19,25]. A systematic review and meta-analysis
found clinically significant BMI reductions for both Lap￾aroscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and Roux￾en-Y type gastric bypass (RYGB) [41]. Surgery was
reported to resolve some medical conditions including
diabetes and hypertension but, this was poorly reported.
Band slippage and micronutrient deficiency were the
most frequently reported complications for LAGB, but
band erosion, port/tube dysfunction, hiatal hernia,
wound infection, and pouch dilation were also reported.
More severe complications have been documented for
RYGB, such as pulmonary embolism, shock, intestinal
obstruction, postoperative bleeding, staple line leak, and
severe malnutrition [41]. A more recent level 1 evidence
study shows greater weight loss for those who
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 2 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

underwent laparoscopic banding procedures than for
those following a medical weight loss program [42].
However, the latter group showed substantial improve￾ment in hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resist￾ance. New non-invasive procedures trying to mimic
hormonal effects of bariatric surgery may become avail￾able [43], but, need testing before proper assessment.
History has shown that extrapolating results from adults
may be flawed. More evidence is needed. Moreover, the
conditions under which bariatric surgery is performed ap￾pears to be highly relevant for the outcome, such as pre￾operative evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, bariatric
surgery competency with children and adolescents, post￾operative care and follow up [4], and family support [25].
The same goes for timing, operations may be performed
too early (with a poor benefit/harm ratio) and too late
(missing relevant health benefits) [44,45]. This makes it
difficult to balance outcomes against risks [46,47],
and to plan post-procedural follow up both on an
individual (micro), institutional (meso), and a societal
(macro) level. Moreover, with bariatric surgery for
children and adolescents the question of “benefit for
whom?” becomes pertinent, as will be discussed in
further detail below.
Safety and risk
The risks and complications of obesity-related comorbidities
are definite and life-threatening [4]. This may justify fer￾vent interventions. However, bariatric surgery is associated
with serious risks and recognized complications, which
appear to be relevant [41]. As stated by Han and co￾workers, “The risks of bariatric surgery are considerable,
and its long-term safety and efficacy in children remains
largely unknown. Therefore, surgery should be reserved
for only the most severely obese (BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2 or
BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 with significant co-morbidities), and even
then, considered with extreme caution” [20]. Moreover,
adverse events are reported to be frequent even with very
experienced surgeons [12,48].
Most published studies measure anthropometric and
metabolic outcomes but, psychosocial effects may be
relevant. Childhood and adolescence is characterized by
intense psychological and social development and turbu￾lence. Only a few studies have investigated psychosocial
effects of bariatric surgery and the results are short term
and based on small patient series’ [49]. Some studies in￾dicate significant rates of high depression scores and
negative self-acceptance in adolescents after laparoscopic
adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) [50]. When bariatric
surgery does not work as expected, people can feel
shame and guilt [51], further enhancing the burden of
being obese. Moreover, persons evaluated for bariatric
surgery showed clinically significant depressive symp￾toms [52]. This indicates that there is a need for psycho￾logical monitoring before and after bariatric surgery and
for additional psychosocial support to be available for
vulnerable sub-groups of adolescents [49,53]. A signifi￾cant rate of unplanned pregnancy within the first 2 years
after bariatric surgery has been reported in female ado￾lescents [54].
Due to the learning curve of bariatric procedures, low
complication rates are typically seen after 100–150 proce￾dures which, indicates that bariatric surgery in children
and adolescents should be performed in specialized, high

volume centers [25]. Accordingly, assessment of safety
and risks may be complex and challenging.
Autonomy and compliance
The reduced autonomy and vulnerability of children and
adolescents pose challenges to decision making [55].
Bariatric surgery will influence a person’s everyday life
and restrict their life-style choices. This raises the ques￾tion of whether surgery decreases or increases patient
autonomy. Obesity is frequently characterized as a life￾style disease and eating is considered to be an individ￾ual’s act of free choice. Obesity is therefore sometimes
conceived of as a weakness of character [56,57] or a
weakness of the will (akrasia). At the same time, it is ar￾gued that obesity may have a genetic origin, reducing
the person’s autonomy. In both cases, it can be argued
that the need for bariatric surgery results from lack of
autonomy. However, a potential lack of control with eating
does not necessarily reduce a person’s ability to assent to
bariatric surgery or other health care issues. Accordingly,
obesity is not a general sign of reduced autonomy. Quite
opposite, as weight reduction can increase a sense of con￾trol and self-esteem, bariatric surgery may increase auton￾omy, e.g. some feel that they gain control because
treatment limits their choice and imposes control over
their eating habits [58]. However, the evidence for such ef￾fects is limited.
Health interventions aimed at obesity may be in the
best interest of the common good, as obesity in children
and adolescents is expected to become a significant
health problem. However, such interventions may be￾come paternalistic and infringe on personal autonomy
[59]. There are many other values involved than health
[60] and there are limits to intrusion on basis of a com￾mon good, even in the area of health [59,61,62].
As children and adolescents may have reduced auton￾omy, they will assent. Parents will frequently give con￾sent for operations for their minor children [63].
However, parents may have different conceptions of the
seriousness of obesity and diverging interests [64]. It is
generally assumed that parents are in the best position
to know what is best for their children but, for some
obese children this presumption can be questioned [65]
(see below). Assessing what is in the best interest of the
child is demanding, especially in cases where there is
justified doubt whether the parent(s) are able to manage
their child’s autonomy.
Furthermore, obesity treatment can be interpreted as a
way of disciplining human bodies. Exercise and dietary
therapy may be seen mainly as an external disciplining
of the human body through the regulation of behavior.
Accordingly, pharmacological therapy is a disciplining of
human behavior by medical intervention, and bariatric
surgery is disciplining through organ modification. If
such disciplining hampers or alters voluntariness, per￾sonal autonomy is challenged.
The intervention hierarchy often demands life-style in￾terventions (and pharmacological interventions) before
surgery [66]. This can be seen as a restriction of choice
and autonomy, and its effectiveness and efficiency is not
well documented [67], especially in children and adoles￾cents. However, the intervention hierarchy may find its
justification in the precautionary principle more than
from evidence on effectiveness and efficiency. Patient
autonomy, (i.e., of children and their parents) may also
be curbed by professionals’ strong opinions about treat￾ment options (discussed below).
It is also argued that patients “should be able to dem￾onstrate adherence to a lifestyle modification program
prior to surgery and the ability to comprehend and be
able to cope with nutritional and behavioral ramifica￾tions of bariatric procedures” [25]. Here, reduced auton￾omy is linked to expected results of bariatric surgery.
Lack of compliance is believed to give a poor outcome.
Some procedures, such as laparoscopic banding, appear
to require more patient compliance than e.g. RYGB [12],
and concerns exist whether young people are able to
comply with rigorous follow up. However, paternalism
may also be lurking, “An adolescent who is not reliable
in other aspects of his/her life, ‘forgets’ school assign￾ments or household chores, and frequently misses ap￾pointments may not be a suitable bariatric candidate.”
[63]. It may be erroneous to infer from the autonomy in
one area of life to the autonomy in another.
Informed consent
Information disclosure and understanding
It is difficult to inform eligible persons in a way that en￾sures valid informed consent [68,69] or assent as the evi￾dence of long-term effectiveness and safety of bariatric
procedures is not clear. It is especially challenging to in￾form individuals about potential harms and uncertain long
term benefits and to inform young people about prospects
that they find hard to identify and recognize. Age, matur￾ation and psychological state are important aspects for as￾sessment [70,71]. Studies show that patients undergoing
bariatric surgery do not remember information on poten￾tial complications [72,73]. Furthermore, the quality of
information on bariatric treatment on the internet pro￾vided by medical centers and professional organizations
is variable [74]. Children and adolescents with severe
obesity may also have difficulties with understanding and
assessing information due to depressive symptoms [52].
Patients, parents, and surgeons may be overly optimis￾tic [63]. Provided information can be biased or poorly
prepared for children and information may be received
and read with strong preferences and preconceptions.
Relevant information may not be disclosed such as,
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 4 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

variability in treatment outcomes from various health
care providers [63], how bariatric treatment may change
the daily life of the person in significant ways, and the
sometimes close relationships between health care pro￾fessionals and industry [75], e.g. with regards to drugs,
devices and surgical banding techniques. Moreover,
health illiteracy is a challenge [69], especially in children
and adolescents. Patients and parents may also seek sur￾gery because they are desperate or have become scared
[63]. Hence, informing children and adolescents is even
more challenging than informing adults eligible for bar￾iatric treatments in order to obtain valid informed con￾sent [27,76].
Competence to consent or assent
As already indicated, obesity is associated with psychiatric
comorbidity [77-86], reduced cognitive abilities [87,88],
and verbal skills [89], affecting patient autonomy and
competence to consent [90]. Obesity is related to anxiety,
depression, and impaired self-esteem [91-95] as well as
impaired social relationships [96]. About one third of the
adult candidates for bariatric surgery were identified as
victims of sexual abuse as children [6,97-99], and many
were subject to childhood mistreatment [97]. Past abuse
appears to be overlooked during assessment for bariatric
surgery [100]. It is argued that assessing mental capacity
in young surgical candidates is important, and psychiatric
comorbidity may be relevant [66] and should be screened
for [101].
Voluntariness
Children, adolescents and parents may have different
conceptions of obesity [102] and of its impact on their
lives [103-107]. Parents tend to focus on the negative
medical and psychosocial impact of obesity. Thus, there
is a risk of (overt or covert) coercion in the child or ado￾lescent’s assent or consent [16,63]. It is argued that it is
important to assess the cognitive, emotional, and social
development as well as support for the child and adoles￾cent’s independence [108]. Caniano provides a useful
checklist for assuring valid consent for surgery on chil￾dren and adolescents and underscores the importance of
making sure that patients and parents understand “the
irreversibility and likelihood of unanticipated negative
consequences several years later” [63].
Minors’ rights to consent to surgery are regulated differ￾ently in different countries. In many countries minors can
give consent to surgery from the age of 16. Parents may
consent for children but, for serious interventions, chil￾dren may have to assent (i.e., they have to be informed in
a way that they understand, and solicit their reactions).
This intensifies the above mentioned challenges with in￾formed consent. There are also other examples where bar￾iatric surgery for children and adolescents comes up
against existing laws and regulations in various countries
[61,62]. However, the legal aspects are beyond the scope
of this article.
Prejudices
Obese persons are subject to several kinds of prejudice
because of their weight [109,110]. Weight discrimination
and stigmatization is well documented and appears to be
rapidly increasing in adults [93,111-115] as well as chil￾dren [116-119]. Typically this takes the form of dispar￾ities in access to health-care facilities [120] and to
education [57]. Negative stereotypes exist, e.g., that over￾weight and obese persons are lazy, sloppy, unmotivated,
noncompliant, less competent, “willful deviants”, and
that they lack self-discipline [56,57,121-125]. Such stereo￾types also exist among health professionals [104,125-129].
Obese persons are subject to “invalid stereotypes”, “fat￾ism”, and “weight-harassment”, and should be regarded as
victims [130]. Although terms like “obesity epidemic” and
“obesity gene” highlight environmental or genetic factors
and indicate that obesity is something which happens to
people more than a result of their choices [131-133], obes￾ity is frequently considered to be a personal responsibility
[134,135]. Although this responsibility may be projected
on parents, children still feel guilt and shame for their
obesity (see below).
Health professionals tend to be pessimistic about
obese people’s ability to manage their situation [136],
and are sometimes reluctant to refer children to bariatric
surgery [137,138]. Almost half of the family physicians
and pediatricians participating in an American study
stated that they would never refer an obese adolescent
for bariatric surgery [138]. One reason for this appears
to be the scarce high quality evidence and fear for
complications.
Stereotypes and prejudices result in discrimination of
appearance and threaten the integrity and dignity of young
people with high body weight who are in a vulnerable situ￾ation and a susceptible phase of development. This also
raises the question of whether pharmacological and surgi￾cal interventions are medical solutions to social problems
(of unsound attitudes and discrimination) [28,29].
The social phenomenon of eating and the social
construction of obesity
Food and eating have strong social and cultural bearings.
At the same time they are considered to be profoundly
private [139]. Bariatric surgery changes people’s eating
habits and preferences, routines, medication regimens,
and ability to socialize. Accordingly, bariatric surgery
may represent an extensive intervention in people’s daily
living. On the one hand, this may not seem important to
children and adolescents at the time of intervention,
however, it may become important to them later in life.
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 5 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

On the other hand, improvement in body weight and in￾creased control with food intake, as well as altered
habits, may have positive effects on social behavior. Sur￾gery may enforce a structured lifestyle.
As obesity is associated with somatic diseases, body
ideals, and lack of self-control [59,60], it may be argued
that bariatric surgery consolidates existing social con￾demnation of fat [5,59] and sustains existing aesthetic
ideals of body and beauty [140]. Like other diseases,
such as HIV, the meaning of (severe) obesity goes be￾yond its actual pathology, e.g., as an indicator for social
status or moral weakness [131]. Interventions towards
obesity have complex social effects, such as social anxie￾ties about fat and physical appearance [141], and are dif￾ficult to gauge [142]. Moreover, defining obesity for
children is more difficult than for adults, in part because
the evidence on morbidity and mortality for obesity in
children are not as prevalent as in adults, as obesity
complications frequently take years to develop [143,144].
There are many social perspectives on “the obesity epi￾demic” in the literature which, have important moral
implications [145,146]. The obesity epidemic can be
interpreted as a social construction by government health
agencies, academic obesity scientists and researchers,
obesity associations, health care professionals with the aim
of creating a market, and industry [131,147]. It has also
been interpreted as a moral panic driven by an ideology of
gender, class and race [148-156], and as a tool for the
politicization of body size, i.e., making private issues sub￾ject to public regulation [131,157]. It is argued that the
construction of the "obesity epidemic" has less to do with
health consequences of excessive weight than with various
financial and political incentives of the public health bur￾eaucracy, weight loss industry, and the medical profession
[131,150]. Obesity has also been interpreted in terms of
the food industry and regulations [158-163]. Bariatric
treatment may be viewed as part of medicalization of peo￾ple’s private sphere and daily life [30,131,164]. Accord￾ingly, bariatric surgery is a way to correct unwanted moral
behavior (calorie intake) transforming persons into pa￾tients [5], and maintaining the “health industry” [131].
Such power perspectives are even clearer with children
and adolescents.
The point here is not that these perspectives are true
but, that they point to important moral and social issues.
As the etiology of obesity is complex and still unclear,
bariatric surgery can be conceived of in many ways and
some of these may be oppressive and discriminating, es￾pecially for children.
Equal access and justice
Bariatric surgery is costly and may drain resources from
other parts of health care. At the same time it may avoid
significant future health costs. Overweight and obesity is
unevenly distributed amongst children and adolescents
[165-167], and those of lower socioeconomic status and
minority status are disproportionately affected [168-173].
There appear to be differences between ethnic groups
[174-177]. In the USA obesity affects one in three socially
disadvantaged children. African American girls and His￾panic and Native American children of both genders have
high rates [63,178]. Hence, it is likely that there is (and will
be) an uneven access to bariatric surgery in children and
adolescents in the same manner as there is in adults
[99,179]. A difference in access challenges norms for
equality [180]. However, as the evidence for the safety, ef￾fectiveness, and efficiency for bariatric surgery for children
(and adolescents) is not yet convincing, it is difficult to
assess its distributive justice. Besides, there may be many
reasons for unequal distribution of bariatric surgery.
The criteria for selection of eligible and motivated candi￾dates for pediatric bariatric surgery is but one of these
[27,52,105].
Stakeholders’ interests
Health professionals are stakeholders with professional
and economic interests [181]. Their main interest is to
help in what they conceive of to be the best way, but they
may also profit from “the obesity epidemic” [5,131,182].
Surgeons may have invested time and prestige in particu￾lar procedures and may have close relationships with in￾dustry. Some surgical procedures require frequent follow
ups and ensure activity. Industry has reasonable interests
in selling equipment and devices. Society may have signifi￾cant long term interests in helping young people to avoid
developing serious and costly diseases. Moreover, informa￾tion providers may profit from communicating success
stories about young people becoming slim and happy after
bariatric surgery.
Parents are mostly devoted to the best interest of their
children but, this does not exclude some of them from
seeing their child’s obesity as a personal failure and that
they find surgery as a convenient solution. Moreover,
the best interest of the child is difficult to assess. Chil￾dren undergoing surgery may, later in life, come to re￾gret the decision (of their parents) and the intervention
by health professionals. This points to a responsibility
both for parents and professionals.
Responsibility
Bariatric surgery for children and adolescents differs
from surgery for adults in that a third party is involved.
Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their child,
including their nourishment [183]. Children have the
right to a healthy environment [184,185]. It is argued
that a children’s rights perspective can propel more ef￾fective health interventions [186]; that parents who do
not listen to advice should be targeted under child
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 6 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

protection laws [187], that children should be removed
from their home under certain conditions [65], and that
state intervention is justified in extreme cases [188-191].
As some parents are (partly) responsible for their child’s
obesity [192-195], surgery can be viewed as a quick fix
for neglected parental responsibility. Childhood obesity
may justify enforced treatment outside the home in the
case of neglect [65]. Parental responsibility may also be
relevant in assessing children (and families) eligibility for
surgery, as parents’ involvement is important in pre￾adolescent and adolescent treatment [196].
In contrast, parents may feel guilt for their child’s situ￾ation, even when such feelings are not justified. It is ar￾gued that parental responsibility should have no influence
on access to surgery [197], that although parents are caus￾ally and morally responsible, they may not be blame￾worthy [198], and that interventions in the families are
not justified [199]. It is also argued that personal and par￾ental responsibility should be analyzed in a social perspec￾tive as a matter of public health [178,200-202], and that
creating healthy defaults can bridge the divide between in￾dividual and social responsibility [160,203-205].
Lack of knowledge – a moral imperative
The present lack of high quality evidence on outcome
and risk in bariatric surgery for children and adolescents
is a moral quandary [181,206,207], and voices a moral
imperative to provide more high quality knowledge. This
of course presupposes that it is acceptable for children
and/or adolescents to participate in research with bariat￾ric surgery. Despite some reluctance in the professional
community, it is argued that as long as high quality evi￾dence of long term outcome is lacking, bariatric surgery
for children and adolescents should be considered in￾novative treatment [63] and that “surgery should be
performed in institutions that are equipped to meet the
tertiary care needs of severely obese patients and to
collect long term data on the clinical outcomes of these
patients” [14]. Children and adolescents enrolled in
studies should be treated at centers with special expert￾ise in care of this group [208]. Therefore, there is an im￾perative to do proper research [63], but, research on
children and adolescents poses a series of challenges, es￾pecially assessment of risks and benefits and informed
consent [209,210]. Research on vulnerable groups entails
special caution [211,212], especially as scientists may
have paternalistic attitudes and prejudice [213].
Conceptual challenges
So called factual issues, such as obesity prevalence and
treatment outcome, have normative (moral) underpinnings.
They depend on the definition of obesity, which has
changed over time [18,214,215], and is still not clear, espe￾cially not for children [216]. The selection of classifications
of nutritional status in children and adolescents, references,
cut-offs, and terms to be used in different contexts are is￾sues with moral foundations and implications, e.g., who
should be treated and how we assess success.
While there is some international consensus on thresh￾olds of body-mass index (BMI) for defining overweight
and obesity in adults, the effects of age, gender, pubertal
status and race/ethnicity on growth make classification
difficult for minors [20]. Consensus on definition and clas￾sification is of vital importance to obtain high quality
knowledge [217].
Obesity is not a category in nature, i.e., it is not a nat￾ural kind [218], but rather a social construction
established to find ways to help people considered to be
vulnerable and in need of aid. It is unclear whether obes￾ity, in itself, is a (biomedical) disease, and whose prob￾lem it is [58,219-222]. The WHO considers obesity to be
a disease, but not all medical experts agree [56,131].
Members of The Obesity Society (TOS) point out that
obesity is not a disease in a strict scientific sense but, a
normative concept suitable to obtain professional atten￾tion and respect [223]. Even where obesity is accepted as
a disease, there is little agreement on what kind of dis￾ease it is, e.g. whether it is a psychological, physiological,
metabolic, esthetical, or behavioral disease. Moreover,
widespread use of surgery can alter obesity from being a
typically “medical disease” to become a “surgical disease”.
Trying to differentiate morbid from non-morbid obes￾ity leads us back to square one; the challenge of defining
cases of obesity eligible for treatment. Focusing on
underlying biological causal factors is so far of little help,
as their interaction is complex and unclear. Moreover,
the underlying biological phenomena we pay attention
to may be addressed because we think they deserve
medical attention, resulting in a circular argumentation.
Furthermore, to alter a normal and well-functioning
organ in order to discipline human behavior may appear
conceptually and morally challenging [224]. Hence, con￾ceptual questions, such as whether obesity is a disease and
how it is to be defined, pose a series of moral issues with
bariatric surgery, especially for children and adolescents.
Discussion
Some studies indicate that bariatric surgery may be ef￾fective on short and medium term weight loss which, is
associated with a reduction of comorbidities, such as
diabetes. Furthermore, it is generally believed that sev￾eral types of bariatric surgery are cost-effective. This
poses a moral imperative to provide surgery to a vulner￾able group of patients in need of help. However, high
quality evidence on safety, efficacy, effectiveness, efficiency,
and cost savings for children and adolescents is lacking.
Exposing young people to potentially harmful treatment
with uncertain outcomes is morally problematic. Hence, it
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 7 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

is difficult to assess the risk/benefit ratio [63] and there is a
moral imperative to provide high quality evidence.
Moreover, bariatric surgery for children and adoles￾cents poses predicaments with informed consent and
assent due to the complexity and uncertainty of infor￾mation, reduced decision making capacity (e.g., due to
potential psychiatric comorbidity), and lack of voluntari￾ness due to family bonds. As obesity is frequently con￾sidered to be a life-style disease, it is associated with
parental responsibility. The involvement of third party
agents (parents) and the association with responsibility
and guilt complicate issues of consent, assent, justice
[30], and the assessment of the best interest of the child.
Obesity is subject to prejudice and discrimination,
posing challenges with prioritization and just distribu￾tion of health care. As prejudice is identified also among
health professionals it may alter the patient-professional
relationship and trust in the health care system. Wide￾spread bariatric surgery for minors can advance ideals
on health and beauty which, may be part of the primary
problem. Hence, bariatric surgery is more than a mere
medical intervention shaping biological bodies – it
shapes and is shaped by culture.
Whether obesity is a disease, how it is defined and
classified, and the selection of end-points for outcome
assessment strongly depends on social commitments
and moral conceptions, e.g., on what we believe to be
harmful and how we think we can provide the best help.
Accordingly, it may be important to avoid the critique
that bariatric surgery for obesity in minors is a
medicalization of their life-world and a quick fix [225].
The ethical analysis in this review does not end with
simple answers or concrete recommendations. The reason
for this is fourfold. First, the (Socratic) approach does not
aim at presenting clear cut conclusions. Rather it aims at
revealing important moral issues that are relevant for open
and transparent decision making processes. Second, deci￾sions have to be made in context and contexts are differ￾ent, e.g., the conceptions of the autonomy of minors is
assessed differently in different countries. Arguments have
to be assessed, values weighted, and alternatives appraised
in the context of decision making. Third, the conclusions
may change rapidly as new methods and new evidence
emerges. Still, many of the moral issues are generic and
may be relevant and have to be addressed in order to im￾plement and offer bariatric surgery to obese minors in a
morally acceptable way. Fourth, this review is written by
an ethicist with special interest in surgery, biotechnology,
and health technology assessment. Despite this compe￾tence, it is far from obvious that the opinion of experts in
ethics should have special weight or priority [226-228].
Others may be as well qualified. In particular, we should
listen to the group in question, and their voice is not al￾ways loud or apparent in the professional literature.
The analysis presented here displays the values at play
in, and related to, the assessment of bariatric surgery for
obese minors. In particular, it tries to highlight the
evaluative aspects of what is regarded as fact. In that
manner it does the preparatory work for the decision
making process. Even more, it tries to direct the process
towards openness and transparency. Ignoring unpleas￾ant, but important, value issues may become more diffi￾cult when they have been explicitly pointed to and
highlighted.
Moreover, the selection of questions and challenges
discussed in this review is by no means value neutral
[31,32]. Nevertheless, the review does not represent spe￾cific interests, such as patient interest groups, surgeons,
industry, health care managers, health insurers, or health
policy makers.
Other methods may, of course, have been applied
[35,36]. Nevertheless, the approach applied here is fairly
well established for assessing health technologies and is
able to highlight many of the challenges that are identified
in the literature. It has also been applied to bariatric sur￾gery for adults [28] and bariatric treatment for adults [29].
Sources of data other than the professional and scientific
literature could also have been applied. In particular, pri￾mary studies with qualitative interviews of eligible persons
for bariatric treatment, surgeons, industry, health insurers,
and health policy makers could shed new light on the
issue. However, primary research has been beyond the
scope of this review.
How specific are the reviewed moral challenges for
bariatric surgery? Are they as relevant for other health
care interventions as well? This may well be, but bariat￾ric surgery poses particular quandaries for minors be￾cause it uses medical interventions to alter everyday
behavior (diet therapy, exercise, cognitive-behavioral
therapies), as well as modifying organs and processes
that otherwise appear healthy and because it does not
remove the multifarious complex and in part unknown
causes of obesity on persons who often cannot give valid
informed consent or assent. It provides no cure but, of￾fers symptom relief and prevents other diseases. More￾over, the disease that bariatric surgery is directed at
alleviating is special in that it is considered to be self￾inflicted, resulting from lack of self-control, and is sub￾ject to prejudice. The evidence for the outcome is also
of poor quality for minors.
Accordingly, it can be argued that to operate or not to
operate, is not the question. The important questions
are; when is the right time for surgery? Which are the
right patients? How should they be prepared for surgery?
[25], and how should they be followed up? [25]. Surgery
very early in the development of obesity can have serious
consequences, but surgery late in the development of se￾vere obesity may also be harmful [99,229]: ‘[a] stitch in
Hofmann BMC Medical Ethics 2013, 14:18 Page 8 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/14/18

time versus a life in misery’ [230]. This dilemma corre￾sponds well with a long tradition in medical ethics
framed by the Greek concept kairos, finding the right
time for intervention. It also reminds us of Macbeth:
“one must ‘make assurance doubly sure.”
Summary
In sum, there is not one answer to the question of whether
bariatric surgery should be performed on obese children
and adolescents. To some minors, bariatric surgery may be
the only option in order to save their lives or to avoid se￾vere disease. For others, bariatric surgery may be morally
wrong, e.g. if more beneficent alternatives exist. This review
has intended to highlight a broad spectrum of moral issues
that have to be addressed to make decisions on whether to
perform bariatric surgery on children and adolescents. In
particular, decision making under uncertainty, informed
consent or assent, prejudice, discrimination, and justice
have been highlighted. These issues are relevant for deci￾sions on the micro, meso and macro level, and they have to
be addressed in context in order to make sound, open and
transparent decisions on bariatric surgery for children and
adolescents. Moreover, the moral issues highlighted in this
review may be crucial in providing a morally justified and
sound health service. Therefore, to cut or not to cut, is not
the question. The important questions are; who to operate
on, when to do it, who is to decide, how to decide, who is
to operate, how best to prepare, and how to follow up, and
last, but not least, how to generate more high quality evi￾dence in a morally acceptable manner. Additionally, we
should ask ourselves how to avoid prejudice and discrimin￾ation as well as surgery due to body ideals or parent’s feel￾ing of guilt and failure.
Cutting into children’s healthy organs in order to discip￾line their behavior, to satisfy social ideals for body shape,
or to compensate for poor parenting should be avoided.
More evidence on outcomes is needed to balance benefits
and risks, to provide information for a valid consent or
assent, and to advise minors and parents.
