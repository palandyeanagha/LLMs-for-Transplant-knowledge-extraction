Transplantation of Isolated Pancreatic 
Islets into the Portal Vein of Diabetic 
Rats 
REcENT work from this laboratory indicates that intraperi￾toneal transplantation of isolated pancreatic islets ameliorates 
the effects of experimental diabetes in rats'. Although the 
intraperitoneal siting of these islets reduces the hyper glycaemia 
and polyuria of streptozotocin induced diabetes in these 
animals, consistently normal values for blood sugar and urine 
volume are rarely achieved. 
In normal circumstances, insulin from the pancreatic 13-cells 
is secreted directly into the portal venous system and we have 
investigated the possibility that this intraportal site may provide

a more physiological environment for the transplanted islets 
and possibly more effective use of secreted insulin. 
Pancreatic islets were collected from Lewis rats by the col￾lagenase digestion method of Lacy and Kostianovsky• and 
separated from unwanted acinar debris by differential layering 
of dialysed 'Ficoll' 3 • This technique involves the mixing of 
digested pancreas with 'Ficoll' 25% (wjv) and the careful layer￾ing above this mixture of 'Ficoll' in decreasing concentrations 
(23 %. 20% and 11 %). Centrifugation for 10 min at 800g leaves 
the acinar tissue in the 25% 'Fico II' while islets rise through the 
density gradient to settle at the 20-11% interface. The isolated 
islets (400-600) were then injected through a I ml siliconized 
syringe and No. 23 needle into the portal vein of diabetic Lewis 
rats of the same inbred strain as the donors. Diabetes had been 
induced in these recipient rats 3 weeks before by the intravenous 
injection of streptozotocin ( 65 mg kg-') and the study included 
a group of ten diabetic rats as control animals. 
After the transplantation operation all rats were returned to 
their metabolic cages and observed for 4 weeks during which 
a free diet of rat chow and water was allowed. Urine volumes 
were measured daily and blood glucose levels estimated on 
alternate days. 
The ten control animals were grossly diabetic with blood 
glucose levels varying between 270 and 720 mg/100 ml and 
urine volumes between 80 and 150 ml daily. Direct injection of 
pancreatic islets into the portal vein resulted in normoglycaemia 
and normal urine volumes in the five rats studied (Fig. 1). 
These results suggest that if transplantation of isolated 
pancreatic islets is to be used in the treatment of clinical diabetes 
the portal venous system may be the site of choice for maximal 
effectiveness.

Sulphate Conjugation and L-Dopa 
Treatment of Parkinsonian Patients 
CoNJUGATION of catecholamines in man was first described for 
adrenaline by Richter in 1940'. He suggested that the con￾jugated product was an ester of sulphuric acid. Richter and 
Macintosh• later demonstrated that conjugation of adrenaline 
markedly reduced its pressor properties and proposed that 
conjugation is a mechanism of inactivation of the biological 
properties of this amine. Holtz and Credner• administered 
L-dopa to several animals including man and isolated both free 
and conjugated dopamine (DA) from urine. Conjugation of 
two metabolites of DA, homovanillic acid (HV A) and 3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), was observed by Shaw, 
McMillan and Armstrong• when they isolated these two pheno￾lic acids from the urine of human subjects who had received 
L-dopa orally. The conjugates of these compounds can be 
isolated by anion exchange chromatography6•
0• When con￾jugated derivatives in the eluates from anion exchange columns 
were hydrolysed by sulphuric acid'·" or sulphatase•, the uncon￾jugated parent compounds were identified by paper chromato￾graphy.
