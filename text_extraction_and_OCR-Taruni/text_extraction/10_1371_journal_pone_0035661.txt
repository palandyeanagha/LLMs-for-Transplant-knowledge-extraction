Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis portends a poor prognosis and cannot be reliably predicted. Early determination of
the metastatic potential of RCC may help guide proper treatment. We analyzed microRNA (miRNA) expression in clear cell
RCC (ccRCC) for the purpose of developing a miRNA expression signature to determine the risk of metastasis and prognosis.
We used the microarray technology to profile miRNA expression of 78 benign kidney and ccRCC samples. Using 28 localized
and metastatic ccRCC specimens as the training cohort and the univariate logistic regression and risk score methods, we
developed a miRNA signature model in which the expression levels of miR-10b, miR-139-5p, miR-130b and miR-199b-5p
were used to determine the status of ccRCC metastasis. We validated the signature in an independent 40-sample testing
cohort of different stages of primary ccRCCs using the microarray data. Within the testing cohort patients who had at least 5
years follow-up if no metastasis developed, the signature showed a high sensitivity and specificity. The risk status was
proven to be associated with the cancer-specific survival. Using the most stably expressed miRNA among benign and
tumorous kidney tissue as the internal reference for normalization, we successfully converted his signature to be a
quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay, which showed the same high sensitivity and specificity. The 4-miRNA is associated
with ccRCC metastasis and prognosis. The signature is ready for and will benefit from further large clinical cohort validation
and has the potential for clinical application.

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for about 3% of all
malignant tumors in adults. Its worldwide incidence and mortality
are approximately 209,000 and 102,000 per year respectively,
including approximately 39,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths in
the United States. [1] Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) represents the
most common renal cancer histology, comprising 70–80% of all
RCC cases. [2] About 30% of patients with newly diagnosed
disease have evidence of metastases at presentation. [3] In the
setting of metastasis, few patients achieve a durable remission with
currently available therapies, with the response rate of about 15–
25% and overall median survival of less than one year. [1] RCC
metastasis cannot be reliably predicted based on patients’ clinical
manifestations, pathologic findings or other currently available
laboratory tests. Although several algorithms have been used to
predict clinical outcome for patients with metastatic RCC
(mRCC) on the basis of clinical and pathologic features, these
do not incorporate the more complex biological features of
individual patients. [2,4] Recent studies have shown that the
metastatic capability of cancer is conferred by genetic changes
occurring relatively early in tumorigenesis and that metastatic
dissemination may occur continually throughout the course of
primary tumor development. [5–7] In light of this, it is
scientifically and clinically relevant to identify the metastasis￾specific molecular biomarkers at the time of nephrectomy to
predict ccRCC metastasis. The early identification of ccRCC
metastatic potential may be beneficial for a more precise
prediction of clinical outcomes and may ultimately be used to
identify subsets of patients that may benefit from specific targeted
therapies. [1].
MicroRNA (miRNA) is a group of small non-coding RNAs that
regulate gene expression during development and differentiation.
[8] Alteration of miRNA expression has been shown in
malignancies [9–11] and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis
and cancer progression [12–13]. Studies have specifically shown
that certain miRNAs play important roles in various steps of the
metastatic cascade, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), adhesion, migration, invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis.
[14–15] Since one miRNA could regulate the expression of

multiple genes, miRNA expression profiles can be more accurate
in cancer subtyping than RNA profiles of protein-coding genes.
[16–17] Molecular signatures based on miRNA expression have
been shown to aid in diagnosis and prognostication of cancer. [18–
19].
In this study, we used microarray technology to profile miRNA
expression in benign kidney and ccRCC specimens. We analyzed
the miRNA expression associated with metastasis in a training
cohort to develop a 4-miRNA expression signature model that can
determine the metastatic status and predict cancer-specific survival
of ccRCC patients. More importantly, this molecular signature has
been validated in an independent testing cohort and has also been
converted to a quantitative PCR (q-PCR)-based assay. This study
is ready for and will benefit from further large clinical cohort
validation and has the potential to be applied in a routine clinical
setting.
Results
Clinical Characterization of Patients’ Specimens in the
Training and Testing Cohorts
A set of benign kidney specimens (n = 10) and a 28-sample
ccRCC training cohort including localized (pT1, n = 13) and
metastatic (M1, n = 15) tumor samples were used to profile
miRNA expression in ccRCC and to develop a signature
associated with metastasis. In addition, an independent testing
cohort of primary tumors from 40 ccRCC patients was used to
validate the signature. At the time of nephrectomy, these patients
had stage I (pT1, n = 6), II (pT2, n = 5), III (pT3, n = 13) and IV
(N2 or M1, n = 16) diseases. In the testing cohort patient group, 35
(35/40) patients had been followed for at least 5 years if no
metastasis developed. At presentation, 16 (16/35) had concurrent
metastasis and 13 (13/35) developed metastasis in the follow-up
period, while 6 (6/35) did not have metastatic disease during the
follow-up period. The clinical characteristics of the specimens are
summarized in Table 1 and Table S1.
Profiling of miRNA Expression in ccRCCs
Using the Agilent microarray technology, the miRNA expres￾sion of all of the benign kidney samples (n = 10) and the training
cohort specimens (n = 28) was profiled. An unsupervised hierar￾chical clustering using these miRNA expression data could
separate the benign and tumor samples (Figure 1). With a cut￾off of a 2-fold change and FDR #0.05, 56 miRNAs were found to
be aberrantly expressed in ccRCCs; 29 were up-regulated and 27
were down-regulated (Table 2). Within the tumor group, 21
miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between
localized and metastatic specimens; 7 were upregulated and 14
were down-regulated in the metastatic tumors (Table 3).
Developing a 4-miRNA Signature Model for the
Determination of the Status of ccRCC Metastasis
Patients with stage I (T1) ccRCC usually have a favorable
clinical outcome and their 5-year survival reaches 95% post
nephrectomy. [20] In the study, T1 tumors were considered to be
‘‘good’’ tumors and were used to represent the control samples to
compare with the metastatic ccRCCs. Using a univariate logistic
regression test and Leave-One-Out cross validation (LOOCV)
within the training set, the optimal p value cut-off to select the
miRNAs associated with metastasis was determined. A range of p
values were tested in this LOOCV test and the p value ,0.01 was
determined due to its best performance among all the p value
cutoffs tested. Additionally, at least 2-fold change difference
between the miRNA expression in metastatic and localized tumors
was used to identify all the miRNAs that showed the largest
difference between metastatic and local tumors. Four miRNAs,
miR-10b, miR-139-5p, miR-130b and miR-199b-5p, satisfied the
above criteria, and hence were selected to build a metastatic tumor
signature. miR-199b-5p and miR-130b were over-expressed in
metastatic tumors, while miR-10b and miR-139-5p were down￾regulated (Figure 2A).
We used a risk score method to construct a signature model for
ccRCC metastasis. [18] Specifically, the risk score formula is a
linear combination of the expression levels of all the 4 miRNAs,
weighted by the regression coefficients derived from the univariate
logistic regression analysis, which is described as following: Risk
score = 21.2755646XmiR-10b+2.1067016XmiR-130b–2.2781926XmiR￾139-5p+1.1011396XmiR-199b-5p.
The next step was to determine a cut-off point for a risk score to
stratify patients into a group of high or low risk for metastasis. The

4-miR Signature for RCC Metastasis and Prognosis

risk score of each patient in the training set was calculated using
the signature model developed, and the FPR and TPR within a
range of cut-off scores were computed. The cut-off point of 28.12
was selected since it gave the best FPR and TPR (Figure 3).
Therefore, a 4-miRNA signature model was developed to
determine the risk status of tumor metastasis, in which a score
$28.12 indicates high risk.
Validation of the 4-miRNA Signature in an Additional
Independent Testing Cohort
To validate the signature, we used the independent testing
cohort of primary ccRCCs. Each specimen was predicted to be
either high or low risk based on its calculated risk score using
the signature. The predicted risk status for each patient was
then compared to the clinical outcome. Of 35 (35/40) patients
with at least 5-year follow-up if no metastasis developed, 22 of
29 (22/29) that had metastatic disease had high risk primary
tumors while 6 of 6 (6/6) with no metastasis had low risk
tumors predicted by the signature. This gave a sensitivity of
76% and a specificity of 100%. Specifically, 13 of 16 patients
(81%) with concurrent metastasis were predicted to be of high
risk; 9 of 13 (69%) with subsequent metastasis, including 2 of 5
(2/5, 40%) with T1/2 tumors and 8 of 9 (8/9, 89%) with T3
tumors, were predicted to be of high risk; and 6 of 6 (100%)
without metastasis were predicted to be of low risk (Figure 4A).
For all 40 patients with or without 5-year follow-up, the
signature showed a sensitivity of 76% (22/29) and a specificity
of 64% (7/11). If patients with concurrent metastasis (stage IV)
were not included, the sensitivity was 69% (9/13) and the
specificity remained the same (7/11, 64%). In the additional 5
primary ccRCC specimens, 1 (1/5) was predicted to be of low
risk and 4 (4/5) was predicted to be of high risk. However,
these specimens were collected within the last two years, and
whether these patients will develop metastasis is not known.
Interestingly, all 4 patients predicted to have high risk had stage
III diseases and the 1 predicted to have low risk had stage I
disease.
The risk score of each ccRCC specimen determined by the 4-
miRNA signature model is associated with the status of metastasis
(OR = 5.50, 95% CI = 1.23–24.51, p,0.05). Other varieties, such
as a patient’s sex, age, tumor grade and stage, did not reliably
predict metastasis (Table 4).
The 4-miRNA Signature Correlates with Overall Cancer￾specific Survivals
We were also interested in examining whether this signature
model could be independently associated with the cancer-specific
survival. With patients in the combined training and testing
cohorts (n = 68), a univariate Cox regression analysis showed that
the predicted risk status was a significant prognostic factor for the
patient’s cancer-specific survival (Table 5). The relative risk for
patients predicted to be of high risk was 12.68 compared to
patients of low risk (HR = 12.68, 95% CI = 2.97254.13,
p,0.0001). The stage of disease was the only other significant
prognostic factor, while age, sex, tumor grade and size were not
correlated with survival. Patients predicted to be of high risk had a
5-year survival rate of only 32%, whereas those of low risk had a 5-
year survival rate of 84% (Figure 5A).
Converting the Microarray-based Signature to a RT-PCR
Based Assay
The greatest challenge for performing RT-PCR based tissue
miRNA expression analysis is to find a reliable reference
miRNA or small RNA for the test normalization. To further
develop a 4-miRNA signature assay using a RT-PCR platform,
the microarray database of miRNA expression in all of the
benign and tumor kidney samples (n = 78) was analyzed. miR￾24 was found to be the most stably expressed in all of the

reference miRNA for normalization.
Each of the 4 miRNAs selected for the signature in each
specimen in the training and testing cohorts were used, and their
expression, normalized by that of miR-24, was analyzed using ABI
TaqMan MicroRNA Assay. Similar to the microarray study
described, using the training cohort, a PCR-based risk score
formula model (Risk score =1.4315596XmiR-10b–1.5305096XmiR￾130b+1.8881446XmiR-139-5p–2.5692806XmiR-199b-5p) was construct￾ed and the corresponding high risk score cut-off (218.11) was
determined (Figure 2B). The signature was then validated using
the testing cohort. For the 35 primary tumor cases with follow-up,

the sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR-based signature were
72% (21/29) and 100% (6/6). Among these cases, 12 of 16 (75%)
with concurrent metastasis were predicted to be of high risk; 9 of
13 (69%) with subsequent metastasis, including 2/5 (40%) T1/2
and 8/9 (89%) tumors, were predicted to be of high risk; and 6 of 6
(100%) without metastasis were predicted to be of low risk
(Figure 4B). For all 40 cases with or without follow-up, the overall
sensitivity and specificity were 72% (21/29) and 64% (7/11). The
signature was also found to be significantly associated with cancer￾specific survival (HR = 8.8, 95% CI = 2.62229.58, p,0.0001)
(Figure 5B, Table 5).
Discussion
Generally, mRCC has an extremely poor prognosis. [1] Early
identification of patients with high risk for cancer metastasis can
enhance disease outcome prediction, stratify patients for suitable
treatment and potential clinical trials and, ultimately, decrease
cancer-specific mortality.
miRNA plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progres￾sion. Many miRNAs reported to be dysregulated in RCC were
also seen in our current study. [21–24] Studies of cancer
metastasis have shown that certain miRNAs, termed ‘‘metasta￾mir’’, were specifically involved in the critical steps of the
metastatic cascade and appeared to be either pro-metastatic or
anti-metastatic by regulating their target genes. [15] In the
current study, we identified and used the altered expression of
miR-10b, miR-130b, miR-139-5p and miR-199b-5p to generate
a metastasis-specific signature. miR-139-5p is down-regulated in
endometrial serous and gastric adenocarcinoma. [19,25] Over￾expression of miR-130b is involved in the growth control of
breast epithelial cells via the modulation of the cell cycle
inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1. [26] Altered expression of miR-199b-5p
is associated with HES-1 gene regulation and metastatic spread
of medulloblastoma. [27] Dysregulation of miR-10b has been
observed in malignant glial tumors, esophageal cancer cell lines
and primary breast cancer, though whether it is involved in
breast metastasis was in debate. [28–32] In our study, miR-10b
has been found to be down-regulated in ccRCCs. The
expression appears to be even lower in metastatic ccRCCs
than that in localized non-metastatic tumors. Our preliminary
data revealed that the overexpression and knockdown of miR￾10b in a cell line derived from a metastatic ccRCC caused
decrease and increase in proliferation and invasion of tumor
cells, respectively (data not shown), which might be involved in
regulating CDK6 and other target genes (www.miRBase.com
and www.oncomine.org).
The 4-miRNA signature is associated with ccRCC metastasis.
Though the validation test has shown that the signature appeared
to be more powerful in identifying concurrent metastases (81%),

the signature is also significantly associated with subsequent/future
metastasis of the primary tumors (69%), including patients with T3
(89%) and T1/2 (40%) diseases. Patients with stage I or II ccRCCs
usually have 5-year survival of 95% and 88% and are often less
likely to develop metastasis compared to those with late stage
diseases. [10] Clinically, it is extremely helpful if the metastatic
potential of T3 tumors can be predicted early, ideally at the time
of nephrectomy. Due to the limitation of sample size, the signature
model warrants and will benefit from further large cohort
validations.
Currently, there is no clinically available molecular assay to
predict ccRCC metastasis. A retrospective study reported that
IMP3 expression analysis by immunohistochemistry could predict
RCC metastasis and prognosis. [33] The study identified IMP3-
positive tumors in 59/95 metastatic RCCs, 60/119 primary RCCs
with metastasis and 11/287 primary RCCs with no metastasis,
rendering an overall sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 96% and a
hazard ratio of 5.66. Our 4-miRNA signature achieves a higher
sensitivity (76% in overall and 69% for predicting tumor with
future metastasis), specificity (100%) and hazard ratio (12.68) as
compared to the IMP3 study. However, our current study has
fewer cases tested and is only limited to the clear cell type of
RCCs. We are planning to evaluate our signature model using
much larger cohorts and to test the effectiveness of the current
model for other types of RCCs.
Our signature has also shown its association with disease
prognosis. Currently, the UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS)
is a widely used prognostic tool for RCC patient’ outcome. It
classifies cases into high, intermediate and low risk groups, based
on tumor stage, histological grade and Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS). [34] As
reported in international multi-center studies [34–35], the overall
5-year cancer-specific survival rates estimated by the UISS were
92–94%, 65–78% and 30–48% for the low, intermediate and high
risk group patients, respectively. To compare the UISS with our
signature, we assigned a UISS risk score to the 35 of 40 testing
cohort cases with available information of ECOG performance
status. The predicted 5-year cancer-specific survival rates were
0%, 63% and 52% for the high, intermediate and low risk group
patients, respectively, by UISS, compared to 32% and 84% for the
high and low risk patients, respectively, by the 4-miRNA signature
(Figure 6). The UISS score seems not to be a significant prognostic
factor for the cases tested in our testing cohort. However, there are
only 35 cases tested, this finding might not be representative. Our
risk scores based on both microarray and RT-PCR are statistically
significant (Table 7). The hazard ratio of our high versus low risk
status is 6.81 (95% CI = 1.52230.53, p value ,0.01) and 4.88
(95% CI = 1.37217.38, p value ,0.01), by microarray and qPCR,
respectively.
In the study, we have found that the clinical stage was the only
other significant prognostic factor. Patients’ age, sex, tumor grade

and size have not been found to be significantly correlated with
survival using our data. As mentioned previously, the sample size
of our study is relatively small and further large cohort validation is
definitively needed for more accurate analysis.
The miRNA signature developed from the current study has
the potential to be applied in a routine clinical setting.
Certainly, converting a microarray-derived signature to a
PCR-based test will make the signature assay more practical
for a clinical laboratory usage. It is always very challenging to
perform qPCR-based miRNA expression studies in clinical
tissues, mainly because there have been no reliable convention￾ally known or commercially available reference miRNAs or
other small RNAs to serve as house-keeping genes in mRNA
expression studies. This probably explains why many published
PCR-based clinical tissue studies of miRNA expression are not
reproducible. It has been suggested to use miR-191 and miR￾103 for tissue miRNA normalization. [36] However, miRNA
expression is very tissue-specific. [8] Some miRNAs stably
expressed in certain tissue types might be expressed differently
in other tissue types. Having carefully analyzed our own
microarray data, we found that miR-24 is most constantly and
stably expressed among all the benign and malignant kidney
specimens. The 4-miRNA signature based on qPCR data also
showed a high sensitivity (72%) and specificity (100%), as well
as a similar association with cancer-specific death, which further
validated our microarray results and provided the technologic
basis for a possible larger scale qPCR-based validation. Our
recent study has shown that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) samples can be reliably used for miRNA expression
profiling studies. [24] We are planning to validate the signature
developed in the current study using a larger FFPE tissue cohort
and to evaluate it in the context of specific therapies.
Materials and Methods
Tissue Sample Preparation and Total RNA Extraction
A total of 78 frozen benign kidney and ccRCC specimens were
used for the study. All the samples were selected from the frozen
tissue specimens stored at the City of Hope National Medical
Center (COH) Tumor Bank. All the available frozen specimens
collected from ccRCC patients at COH between 1986 and 2008
which were included for the study were first tested using the 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara CA) as
quality control (total RNAs with the quality index .5.0 for each
specimen).
Specifically, the benign kidney tissue and primary tumors were
sampled from the nephrectomy specimens. All the qualified benign
samples (n = 10) were randomly selected from the available
specimen collection. All the localized ccRCC samples (n = 13)
for the training cohort were pT1 (stage I) primary tumors with no
reported subsequent metastasis were randomly selected from the
same available collection. The metastatic ccRCC samples (n = 15)
used for the training cohort included all the available frozen
specimens taken from the resection/biopsy specimens of distant
metastases or lymph nodes during the time period. All the
remaining available primary ccRCC specimens were used for the
testing cohort (n = 40). The information of the patients’ age, sex,
race and clinical tumor stage is listed in a table (see Table S1).
The samples were snap-frozen shortly after operation and had
been stored at –80uC at the COH Tumor Bank. The protocol for
using these samples was approved by the COH Cancer Protocol
Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and Institutional
Review Board (IRB). A waiver of informed consent and HIPAA
authorization has also been approved by the COH IRB. Total
RNA was extracted from up to 10 sections (10 mm in thickness) of
each sample as described previously. [24].
Microarray Analysis for miRNA
Microarray testing of miRNA expression was performed at the
COH Microarray Core using the Agilent human miRNA
microarray V2 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara CA),
which contains probes for 723 human miRNAs from Sanger
miRBase 10.1, as described previously. [24] Briefly, 1 mg total
RNA was labeled with Cy3 with T4 RNA ligase and hybridized to
the array for 20 hours at 55uC. The arrays were then washed and
scanned using an Agilent scanner with default settings. Scanned
images were subject to Agilent Feature Extraction Software v. 10.5
for raw data processing.
Statistical Analysis and the Method of miRNA Signature
Construction
The analysis was performed using R statistical language. Raw
data from Agilent miRNA array was processed by Quantile
normalization, followed by log2 transformation with an offset of 1.

[37] Differentially expressed miRNAs between tumor (training
cohort) and benign samples were selected using t-test with a FDR
#0.05 and fold change of 2.
To develop the miRNA signature, univariate logistic regression
analysis was used to identify miRNAs that were associated with
metastasis. Specifically, the miRNA signature development
consists of the following steps: 1) Univariate logistic regression
analysis was used to identify miRNAs that were associated with
metastasis; 2) A mathematical formula based on the expression
levels of the identified miRNAs was developed to assign a risk
score for each patient; 3) A risk score cut-off was determined to
classify each patient into a high or low risk group.
Step 1 is a feature selection step, and step 2 and 3 are model
building steps. In step 1, a range of p values (0.05, 0.02, 0.01,
0.005, 0.002 and 0.001) were tested with LOOCV and found the
best p value cutoff of 0.01. Specifically, at each iteration step of the
cross validation, one sample was tested (the test sample) while the
others remained in the training group (n = 28–1). During the
process, the feature selection and formula development were
repeated within each iteration step and the signature model was

used to predict the status of the test sample. Following Simon et
al’s suggestion [38], the feature selection and signature model
building steps were entirely independent of the test sample. This is
critical to ensure that the performance of the signature model
formula developed can be estimated without any bias. Using
LOOCV, we could achieve a minimal error rate with a p value
,0.01. We also arbitrarily required a fold-change between
metastatic and localized specimens of $2, which could help to
develop a PCR-based assay for the signature. These criteria
resulted in 4 miRNAs that were significantly associated with
metastasis.
To investigate the effectiveness of these four miRNAs as a
signature to determine the status of metastasis, a mathematical
formula constructed, taking into account both the strength and the
positive or negative association of each miRNA with metastasis.
More specifically, a risk score was calculated for each patient in the
training cohort group using the formula, which was a linear
combination of the expression levels of the miRNAs, weighted by
the regression coefficients derived from the aforementioned
univariate logistic regression analysis. To choose the optimal risk
score cutoff, a range of scores were tested to stratify these patients
into high and low risk groups. The false positive rate (FPR) and
true positive rate (TPR) of these cutoffs were calculated and a risk
score cutoff point was selected based on the lowest FPR and
highest TPR (FPR = 8%, TPR = 100%) (Figure 3). Therefore, a
miRNA signature model, which consists of a risk score formula
and a high risk score cutoff, was developed to classify patients into
high and low risk groups for developing metastasis.
The performance of the signature was further validated using
the additional independent testing cohort data set (n = 40), in
which each patient’s risk for developing metastasis was determined
based on the calculated risk score and then compared to the
clinical follow-up information.
To investigate whether the 4-miRNA signature was also an
independent prognostic factor for cancer specific survival,
univariate Cox regression analysis was used to examine the
patients’ risk status based on the signature, patient age and gender,
tumor histologic grade and size, clinical stage and available UISS
score (see discussion). A p value ,0.05 was used to determine
significance.
RT-PCR Testing
In each sample, the expression of hsa-miR-10b, 130b, 139–
5p and 199b-5p was analyzed using RT-PCR TaqMan
MicroRNA Assays and 7900 HT Fast Real-time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 10 ng of total
RNA from each sample was subjected to reverse-transcription
forming 1st strand cDNA with mature miRNAs specific
primers containing stem loop, followed by real-time PCR with
TaqMan probes. PCR reactions for each sample were carried
out in triplicate. Each miRNA expression, normalized by hsa￾miR-24, was quantified using the formula X=2–DCT, where
DCT = CT(miR-X)–CT(miR-24).
