 A NEW ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTIC, 
 SPERGUALIN : 
 ISOLATION AND ANTITUMOR 
 ACTIVITY 
Sir: 
 In testing the activity of culture filtrates to in￾hibit focus formation of chicken fibroblasts by 
Rous sarcoma virus, an antibiotic produced by a 
bacillus isolated from a soil sample collected at 
Ohira-san, Tochigi Prefecture was thought to be 
worthy of further study, even though daily intra￾peritoneal injection (0.25 ml) of its culture fil￾trate for 9 days caused death of mice and showed 
no effect in prolonging the survival period of mice 
bearing L-1210 leukemia. Since the culture 
filtrate inhibited the growth of B. subtilis and S. 
aureus, we extracted and purified the antibacterial 
activity. The antibiotic thus purified had a low 
toxicity and exhibited a marked effect against 
mouse L-1210 leukemia. The ratio of 50 
inhibition concentration (131tg/ml) against the 
growth of chicken fibroblasts to 50% inhibition 
concentration (5.5 pg/ml) against focus formation 
by Rous sarcoma virus was 2.3. On the basis of 
the structure which will be reported in the next 
papery, this antibiotic was named spergualin. 
In this paper, we will report on the isolation and 
antitumor activity of spergualin. 
 The strain producing spergualin was numbered 
as BMG162-aF2 in the authors' Institute. The 
taxonomic study suggested that this strain was 
closely related to Bacillus laterosporus. Sper￾gualin was produced, extracted and purified by 
the following processes. The strain BMG162-
aF2 was shake-cultured at 28°C in a medium con￾taining 2.0% glycerol, 2.0% dextrin, 1.0% soy 
peptone (Bacto-soytone, Difco Laboratories), 
0.3% yeast extract, 0.2% (NH4)2SO4 and 0.2 
CaCO3 (adjusted to pH 7.4). After 3-4 days 
culture, more than 100 lig/ml of spergualin was 
produced as shown by a cylinder plate assay 
using Bacillus subtilis PC1219 as the test organ￾ism. The antibiotic in the culture filtrate (4,900 
ml) was adsorbed on a column (500 ml in 5.2 cm 
diameter) of Amberlite IRC-50 (70% Na+ form) 
and eluted with 1 N HCI (2,000 ml). After neu￾tralization of the eluate, the antibiotic was ad￾sorbed on a column (400 nil in 4.3 cm diameter) 
of CM-Sephadex C-25 and eluted with 0.3 M 
NaCI. The active eluate was concentrated to 
dryness and the residue was extracted with
methanol (5 ml). The methanol solution was 
passed through a column (445 ml in 2.6 cm di￾ameter) of Sephadex LH-20 and the column was 
developed with methanol. The concentration 
of the active fractions gave pure spergualin 
trihydrochloride as a colorless hygroscopic pow￾der (460 mg). Physicochemical properties are 
described in the next papery. 
Spergualin trihydrochloride is easily soluble in 
water and as shown in Table 1, in the usual agar 
dilution method on a nutrient agar plate, sper￾gualin at 50-. 100 ltg/ml inhibited the growth of 
Gram-positive and -negative bacteria except Ser￾ratia marcescetrs and Ps. aeruginosa. B. subtilis 
PCI219, S. aureus Smith, Sal. typhi T-63 and Pr. 
vulgaris OX19 were relatively sensitive to sper￾gualin and their growth was inhibited at 6.25 lig/ 
ml. 
 In a test where 10° L-1210 cells were intraperi￾toneally inoculated and spergualin dissolved in 
saline was injected daily from the following day

the tumor cell inoculation, for 9 days, as shown in 
Table 2, 1.56 - 50 pig/mg/day prolonged the survi￾val period of mice markedly. All mice treated 
with spergualin 6.25 mg/kg/day survived. The 
control mice died 7.5 - 8.5 days after the tumor 
cell inoculation. The death of mice treated with 
25 or 50 mg/kg/day was not due to the toxicity of 
spergualin. This was due to L-1210 leukemia, 
because the tumor cells grew as ascites before 
death. Mice died 7'33 days after the last injec￾tion of spergualin. As will be reported in an 
other paper, the inoculation of the tumor cells 
taken from mice treated with 50 yg/mouse was 
significantly more resistant to spergualin treat￾ment than the inoculation of the original L-1210 
cells. 
 As shown in Table 3, spergualin showed a 
marked effect in prolonging the survival of mice 
to which 103 L-1210 cells were inoculated sub￾cutaneously. All mice treated by intraperitoneal 
injection of spergualin 12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg daily 
survived. The treatment was started I day after 
the tumor cell inoculation and continued for 9 
days. The mice without treatment died 8 - 10 
days after the inoculation. The mice which sur￾vived were resistant to the second inoculation of 
L-1210 cells. 
Spergualin also prolonged the survival period 
of mice to which 103 cells of EL-4 mouse leukemia 
were inoculated as shown in Table 4. 
 Spergualin also prolonged the survival period 
of mice bearing Ehrlich carcinoma in the ascites 
form: 2 x 100 Ehrlich carcinoma cells were ino￾culated intraperitoneally to tnice; spergualin 
was given intraperitoneally daily from I day after 
the inoculation for 9 days, and the percentage of 
the survival days to those of the control was 133 
by 1.56 mg/kg/day, 188% by 3.13 mg/kg/day, 
236% by 6.25 mg/kg, 170% by 12.5 mg/kg. 
Higher doses such as 25 or 50 mg/kg/day short￾ened the survival period (72 % by 25 mg/kg/day, 
54 % by 50 mg/kg/day). In this case, ascites did 
not increase and the cause of the death was not 
certain. 
 In experiments performed by a procedure 
similar to the one to test the effect against Ehrlich 
carcinoma, spergualin prolonged the survival 
period of mice bearing sarcoma 180: 220% by 
1.56 mg/kg/day, 243 % by 3.13 mg/kg/day, 181 
by 6.25 mg/kg/day, 279 % by 12.5 mg/kg/day. 
High doses such as 50 mg/kg/day or 25 mg/kg/day 
shortened the survival period (53% by 50 mg/kg/ 
day; 69 % by 25 mg/kg/day). 
 Spergualin has low toxicity: intravenous injec￾tion of 80 mg/kg did not cause the death of mice 
but the LD50 markedly fluctuated depending on 
the injection speed. The LD50 by intraperitoneal 
injection was about 150 mg/kg. It was found 
that spergualin seems to have no cumulative toxi￾city.
