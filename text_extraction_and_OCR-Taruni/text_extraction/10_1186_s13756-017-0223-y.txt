Abstract
Background: Surgical site infections (SSI) are one of the most common healthcare associated infections in the
low-middle income countries. Data on incidence and risk factors for SSI following surgeries in general and
Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries in particular are scare. This study set out to identify risk factors for SSI
in patients undergoing Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries in an Indian rural hospital.
Methods: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure between September 2010 to February 2013 in the
60-bedded ward of Obstetric and Gynecology department were included. Surveillance for SSI was based on
the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) definition and methodology. Incidence and risk factors for SSI, including
those for specific procedure, were calculated from data collected on daily ward rounds.
Results: A total of 1173 patients underwent a surgical procedure during the study period. The incidence of
SSI in the cohort was 7.84% (95% CI 6.30–9.38). Majority of SSI were superficial. Obstetric surgeries had a
lower SSI incidence compared to gynecological surgeries (1.2% versus 10.3% respectively). The risk factors for
SSI identified in the multivariate logistic regression model were age (OR 1.03), vaginal examination (OR 1.31);
presence of vaginal discharge (OR 4.04); medical disease (OR 5.76); American Society of Anesthesia score
greater than 3 (OR 12.8); concurrent surgical procedure (OR 3.26); each increase in hour of surgery, after the
first hour, doubled the risk of SSI; inappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis increased the risk of SSI by nearly 5 times. Each
day increase in stay in the hospital after the surgery increased the risk of contacting an SSI by 5%.
Conclusions: Incidence and risk factors from prospective SSI surveillance can be reported simultaneously for the
Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries and can be part of routine practice in resource-constrained settings. The incidence
of SSI was lower for Obstetric surgeries compared to Gynecological surgeries. Multiple risk factors identified in the present
study can be helpful for SSI risk stratification in low-middle income countries.

Background
Postoperative surgical site infections (SSI) are an important
health care associated (HAI) infection and one of the most
frequent causes of post-operative morbidity [1]. In high￾income countries, approximately 2% of surgeries are
affected by SSIs [1, 2]. Although the rates of SSI are low in
United States of America (USA) and European countries it
is second frequent type of HAI [1]. World Health
Organization (WHO) shows that SSIs are most frequently
reported type of HAI in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) with a pooled incidence of 11.8 episodes of SSI
per 100 surgical procedures [1].
In high-income countries the SSI rates for gynecological
surgeries are similar to that of other surgical procedures
[3]. Hysterectomy for gynecological causes is reported to
have a SSI rate of 1.7% according to the Centre for Disease
Control (CDC), USA data [3–5]. SSIs are the second most
common complication after urinary tract infections as HAI
in cesarean delivery (CD) with reported rates between 3 to
15% in USA [6–8] and a cumulative rate of 2.9% in
European Centre for Disease Control data from 20 net￾works in 15 European Union countries [9]. However, the
rates of SSI following CD have varied from 10 to 20% in
studies from LMIC’s [1, 10–12].
In USA an episode of SSI among the gynecological sur￾geries, doubles the episode cost of care and triples the risk
of re-admission [13]. Because of these financial implications
the efforts to improve quality of surgery in high-income
countries have been initiated. Some such efforts include the
CDC’s National Health Safety Network (NHSN) and
American College of Surgeon’s National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program in USA [14, 15]. These initiatives
have focused on establishing standard methods of data
collection on risk factors for SSI and 30-day post discharge
surveillance [14, 15]. However, the NHSN SSI risk model
for obstetric surgeries does not have more than 3 independ￾ent variables for predicting SSI [14]. Also, there are limited
numbers of study that simultaneously report SSI from both
obstetric and gynecological surgeries [12, 16, 17]. Simultan￾eous reporting of SSI rates from both obstetric and
gynecological surgeries would give a more complete picture
of SSI. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to esti￾mate the occurrence of 30-day postoperative SSI within a
single gynecology and obstetric department and to identify
the associated risk factors. To the best of our knowledge
this is the first study in India reporting incidence and risk
factors associated with Obstetric and Gynecological
surgeries simultaneously.
Methods
Setting
The study was carried out at the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology in the Chandrikaben Rashmikant Gardi
Hospital (CRGH), which is situated in a rural area of
Madhya Pradesh in India. The CRGH is a 600-bed teach￾ing, tertiary care hospital within the private, not-for-profit
health care sector and attached to RD Gardi Medical
College (RDGMC), Ujjain.
Patient characteristics
Duration of study
The study was conducted on consecutive women admitted
in CRGH from September 2010 to February 2013.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criterion was to have undergone a major
Obstetrics and/or Gynecological surgery at the CRGH.
Patients that stayed in the hospital for less than 24 h
post-operatively were not included in the study.
List of obstetric and gynecological procedures performed
The obstetric operative procedures performed were:
lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) for cesarean
deliveries (CD), exploratory laparotomy for ectopic
pregnancy and dilatation and curettage for medical ter￾mination of pregnancy. The gynecological procedures
performed were: vaginal hysterectomy for 2nd or 3rd
degree utero-vaginal discharge; abdominal hysterectomy
for fibroids or dysfunctional uterine bleeding; radical
hysterectomy for invasive carcinomas (for example
endometrial carcinoma and ovarian cancer). Exploratory
laparotomy for ovarian cancer; anterior colporraphy for
cystocele; cervical biopsy for suspected cervical cancer;
polypectomy for endometrial polyp; tubal ligation and
tubectomy; dilatation and curettage for dysmenorrhea or
dysfunctional uterine bleeding. No laparoscopic proce￾dures were done during the study period.
Risk factors for SSI
Risk factors for SSI were explored and grouped in following
categories: demographic features, peri-operative co-morbid
conditions like number of vaginal examinations up-to 48 h
prior to surgery, presence of vaginal discharge, elevated
blood sugar (due to either Diabetes mellitus or gestational
diabetes). Presence of medical disease defined as presence
of any of the following: hypertension (either essential or
pregnancy induced), severe anemia defined as preoperative
hemoglobin <7 g%, or presence of any diagnosed systemic
disease like renal, heart disease, or liver disease. Require￾ment of blood transfusion pre-surgery, during or 48 h post
surgery was recorded. American Society of Anesthesia
(ASA) class was dichotomized in ASA class 1 or class 2 (as
one class) and ASA class 3 or more [18]. Intraoperative
factors that were explored were: emergency or non￾emergency surgery, type of anesthesia, wound classification,
concomitant other surgical procedures and operative time.
Operative time was measured as the time from skin inci￾sion to completion of skin closure and was classified as less
Pathak et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control (2017) 6:66 Page 2 of 8

than or up-to one hour, between 1 to 4 h and more than
4 h. An operative time more than 4 h was considered a risk
factor for SSI based on previous work done by Culver et al.
[14]. Administration of antibiotic prophylaxis with intraven￾ous Cefazolin in the dose of 1 g given one hour prior to
surgery and continued for maximum up-to 48 h was
considered appropriate practice. Any deviation from above
practice was noted as inadequate prophylaxis. Duration of
pre and postoperative stay was calculated in days and
compared for patients with and without SSI’s.
Surgical preparation
All procedures followed the same protocol. Shaving was
done 24 h before surgery using razors. Surgical site was
prepared with alcohol-povidone iodine-alcohol sequence.
The initial dressing check was done 48 h after surgery.
Provider characteristics
During the study period, the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology had two operating units, having 30 beds
each, distributed in two wards. Each unit had at least
three residents and teaching faculty consisting of a pro￾fessor, an associate professor, and an assistant professor.
The teaching and surgical experience of each professor
was a minimum of 8 years, associate professor 5 years
and assistant professor at least 3 years. A senior and a
junior level resident, under the supervision of at least one
teaching faculty, assisted all the operative procedures.
Data collection
A surveillance system as suggested by the CDC NHSN
criteria were used for diagnosing SSI [19]. SSI was
defined as a wound swab culture confirmed infection at
the site of surgery within 30 days after an operation [19].
The SSIs were classified as: superficial incisional/vaginal
cuff cellulitis, deep incisional or pelvic cellulitis organ/
space infections as per NHSN criteria [19].
Data were collected prospectively using predefined
data collection forms developed after literature review to
identify risk factors for SSI and also after local expert
group consultations. Trained research assistant collected
information daily on all study participants after
obtaining informed written consent, and followed them
until discharge, completed a form containing potential
risk factors for SSI, sent wound swab for culture as
appropriate and completed post discharge surveillance.
The post discharge surveillance was done by actual
patient visit in majority of patients (81%) or by mobile
phones, as described elsewhere [20]. The in-charge
teaching faculty, junior and senior resident, did direct
surgical site surveillance by inspecting the surgical site
48 to 72 h after surgery.
Statistical analysis
Data were entered in EpiData Software (version 3.1,
EpiData Software Association, Odense, Denmark) and
transferred to Stata (version 11.0; Stata Corp, College
Station, TX) for analyses. Frequencies and percentages
were determined for binary and categorical variables.
Range and means were calculated for continuous
variables. Overall and procedure specific cumulative
incidence rate of SSI was also calculated.
Pearson Chi-square test was used to test for each risk
factor’s association with SSI. Stepwise multivariate logistic
regression with backward elimination was used to develop
the model. In bivariate analyses, a P value of <0.1 was
considered significant for entry into the model, with SSI
as outcome variable. The analysis was started with the full
model, then the variable with highest P value was re￾moved, and model was revised and refitted with remaining
predictors. The procedure was repeated till the P value of
all the predictor variables was less than 0.1 except age; we
designated this as final model. Adjusted odds ratios and
their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then
calculated from the final model. A P value of < .05 was
considered significant in the final model. For the final
model, model discrimination was done using C-statistics￾receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curve, while
model calibration was done using Hosmer-Lemeshaw
“goodness-of-fit” test [21–23]. The ROC quantifies the
ability of the model to accurately predict risk factors that
will lead to development of SSI versus those that will not.
A value more than 0.75 (and near one) predict excellent
discrimination [21, 22]. A better model calibration is mea￾sured by a high P-value of the chi-square value in the
Hosmer-Lemeshaw “goodness-of-fit” test [22]. Ethical
permission for the study was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of RDGMC (approval number 114/2010)
Results
Demographics
Of the 2560 admitted patients, 1173 underwent a
surgical procedure. These patients constituted the
final cohort. Age ranged from 10 to 80 years
(mean ± standard deviation: 37.3 ± 13.6). Three
patients died during the hospital stay in the study
period (3/1173;0.2%). SSI was not suspected in any of
the patient that died. The majority (75%) of surgeries
performed were elective procedures. Most surgeries
were clean (78%) or clean contaminated (18%). Very
few surgeries were contaminated (2%). The duration
of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 90 days
(mean ± standard deviation: 13.8 ± 8.6 days). The
mean length of postoperative stay for patients with
SSI was longer by 3.61 days compared to patients
without SSI (11.53 days vs. 7.92 days).

Incidence of SSI
SSI was confirmed in 92 of the 1173 patients in the co￾hort. Thus, the cumulative incidence rate of SSI was
7.84% (95% CI 6.30–9.38). These SSI were further classi￾fied into superficial incisional primary (5.62%; n = 66),
deep incisional primary (2.22%, n = 26). The SSI rates
were lower for obstetric surgeries compared to
gynecological surgeries; 1.23% (95% CI 0.02–2.4) versus
10.37% (95% CI 8.32–12.43), respectively. The list of surgi￾cal procedures performed and the distribution of the SSI
rates according to the different surgical procedures is
shown in Table 1. The characteristics of patients with and
without SSI are given in Table 2. Procedures like anterior
colporrhaphy, vaginal and radical hysterectomies were as￾sociated with higher SSI rates (between 9 to13%) whereas
lower SSI rates (between 3 to 7.6%) were observed for
dilatation and curettage and LSCS. The indications of
LSCS in the study are shown in Table 2.
Risk factors associated with SSI
There were no statistically significant differences between
patients having superficial versus patients having deep SSI,
therefore the risk factor for both are presented together.
a) Bivariate analysis. Patients older than 40 years of age
were more likely to have an SSI than those between
25 and 40 year of age (OR 2.95; vs. 2.19); as compared
to those less than 25 years of age. The odds of SSI
were almost 3 times higher for grand-multipara
(5 or more pregnancies) compared to primiparous
women. Number of vaginal examinations in 48 h prior
to surgery, were significantly related to SSI, with odds
increasing with increasing number of examinations
(OR 10.00 vs. 37.67 for 1–9 examinations and >10
examinations, respectively compared with no vaginal
examinations). Similarly, presence of vaginal discharge
before the surgery increased the risk of SSI. Presence
of high blood sugars (either Diabetes Mellitus or
gestational diabetes) and medical illness (severe
anemia, heart disease, hypertension and renal disease)
emergency surgical procedure and use of general
anesthesia during the surgery increased the risk of SSI
(Table 3). ASA class 3 or higher had greater risk for
SSI compared with class 1 or 2 (OR 20.28). Duration
of surgery of more than 4 h increased risk of SSI (OR
5.67), and also incorrect timing of antibiotic
prophylaxis was associated with increased risk of SSI
(Table 3).
b) Multivariate analysis. The results of final fitted
model (Table 4) showed that with increase
in the age the risk of SSI increased
(OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.06; P = 0.001). Compared
to no vaginal examination, each vaginal examination
increased the risk of SSI by 31% (OR 1.31, 95% CI
1.23–1.40; P < 0.001). Presence of vaginal discharge
at the time of admission also increased the risk of
SSI (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.77–9.20; P = 0.001).
Presence of a medical disease increased the risk of
SSI by nearly 6 folds (OR 5.76, 95% CI 2.84–11.67;
P < 0.001). An ASA class of greater than 3 was
associated with increased risk of SSI (OR 12.8, 95%
CI 5.32–30.79; P < 0.001). A concomitant surgery
increased the risk of SSI (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.36–
7.83; P = 0.008). Each increase in hour of surgery,
after the first hour, doubled the risk of SSI (OR 2.02,
95% CI 1.53–2.66; P < 0.001). If the antibiotic
prophylaxis timing was inappropriate i.e. not within
one hour of surgery, it increased the risk of SSI by
nearly 5 times (OR 4.91, 95% CI 2.04–11.81;
P < 0.005). Each day increase in stay in the hospital
after the surgery increased the risk of contacting an
SSI by 5% (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10;
P = 0.007).

c) Model performance. The ROC of the final model
was 0.9513 showing excellent model fit. The
Hosmer-Lemeshaw test showed that chi-square was
5.69 (P = 0.6823) showing good model calibration.
d) Power calculation. With 1173 patients that underwent
surgery in the cohort we could detect a change in SSI
rate (dependent variable) in the cohort from 3 to 10%
with at least 10% variation in predictor (independent
variables) with a power of 99%.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in India
reporting incidence and risk factors associated with
Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries simultaneously. A
study from Tanzania reported a SSI rate of 10.9% among
774 patients undergoing CD [11]. A study from Estonia
reported a SSI rate of 6.2% among 305 patients that
underwent cesarean section deliveries and had a 30-day
follow-up post surgery [24]. A cohort of women with CD
from Thai-Myanmar border showed a SSI rate of 5.9% [25].
All the above studies have reported a higher rate of SSI
among the CDs as compared to our study. An Italian study
reported an SSI rate of 4.7% from 430 mothers with CD in￾cluded in the study [26]. A study from Israel reported an
SSI rate of 3.7%, which is similar to our study [27]. One rea￾son for low rate of SSI in our study could be due to high
proportion of patients belonging to clean or clean contami￾nated wounds. It is well known that patients with contami￾nated wounds have nearly three-fold increased risk of SSI
compared to non-contaminated wounds [1, 14]. Other rea￾son could be due to the fact that most of the CDs were
done within an hour. This might be due to experience of
the operating team. However, it has been shown that CDs
performed by resident teaching services increased the risk
for SSI (OR 2.15) [8]. This might be due to lack of surgical
experience among the operating residents.
Most of the SSIs found in our study were superficial SSI.
This is similar to other studies from resource-constrained
settings [11, 25]. In USA also approximately two-thirds of
the SSI are superficial and remaining deep [3].
Gynacological surgeries showed higher SSI rates
compared to obstetric procedures (Table 1). In USA the es￾timated incidence of SSIs in hysterectomy is around 1.7%
[3]. However, according to the authors this seems to be an
underestimate as many hospitals lack the resources to track
SSI occurring outside of the hospital (up-to 30 days postop￾eratively) [3].
Young maternal age has been shown to be a risk factor
for SSI following cesarean section. However, our study
we found that age more than 40 years as a risk factor for
SSI. This may be due to the patient mix in our study,
which included both gynecological and obstetric surger￾ies. A regional collaborative data from USA did not
show any difference in age of the women having SSI
following hysterectomy [28]
Abdominal route of hysterectomy has been shown to
have a higher risk for SSI when compared to vaginal
hysterectomy.
Longer operative time by more than 30 min increases
the risk for SSI (OR 1.30) [28]. Another study identified
that an operative time longer than 75th percentile in￾creased the risk of SSI by 1.84 times compared to vaginal
approach [4]. Duration of surgery longer than one hour
has been shown to be associated with increased risk for
SSI. A longer operative time is probably a proxy for
complicated surgery [7]. Other explanations for associ￾ation between longer surgical time and risk for SSI
include: inadequate dosing of prophylactic antibiotic, tis￾sue trauma due to instrumentation and manipulation,

increased risk for hypoglycemia and hypothermia, in￾creased blood loss, exposure to environmental patho￾gens, and risk for breech of sterile technique [7, 29, 30].
Inappropriate timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in our
study was a significant risk factor for SSI. Similar results
have been reported earlier and are also in line with
recommendations from prophylaxis guidelines [31].
However, during the study period no standard policy
for prophylaxis was followed. The American Congress
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends
pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for hysterecto￾mies, induced abortions, hysterosalpingography, and
uro-gynacological procedures [31].
Multiple vaginal examinations and presence of vaginal
discharge increased the risk for SSI in our study. This
may be due to ascending infection leading to secondary
spread to the surgical site. Another study reported that
multiple vaginal examinations (more than three)
increased the risk for SSI by 2.6 times [11]. Another
study identified chorioamnionitis as a major risk factor
for SSI post cesarean delivery [8].
We grouped presence of medical diseases post-hoc be￾cause of small number of patients with individual medical
disease. Risk factors including medical diseases identified
for SSI from two large studies are: obesity, diabetes, smok￾ing, respiratory infection, poor nutrition, ASA score greater
than 2, and low socio-economic status [4, 7]. An ASA score
of more than three was reported to increase the risk of SSI
by 1.52 times [28]. A study on SSI following cesarean
section from Tanzania showed that ASA score more than 3
had about 2.7 times higher risk for SSI [11]. For superficial
SSI the risk was shown about 1.52 times for gynecological
surgeries [28], while another study showed the risk as 1.79
times [4]. For cesarean deliveries, a study reported the risk
1.61 times [8]. Diabetes has been significantly associated
with SSI secondary to gynecological surgeries [3]. The
specific risk reported in hysterectomies is 1.54 times [4].
Patients of diabetes especially with poor glycemic control
share much comorbidity, like obesity, poor nutritional
status, poor peripheral oxygen supply, and metabolic
derangements [3]. Obesity is an uncertain risk factor for
SSI in gynecological surgeries [4]. It has been shown in one
study that rather than obesity, subcutaneous thickness as
measure by MRI could be more important risk factor for
SSI [32]. Patients with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy
have been show to have 2.9 times higher risk for SSI [3]. A
history of cerebrovascular accidents with neurological
deficit has been shown to increase the risk of SSI by 4.41
times (95% CI 1.54–12.65; P < 0.001) [4]. Our study did not
find an association between preoperative blood transfusion
and SSI. The findings are similar to a large secondary
database analysis from USA [4] and also from a large
regional collaborative from Michigan [28]. However,
other studies have identified association between
blood transfusion and SSI [5]. An explanation for risk
for SSI following blood transfusion remains unclear
and probably reflects a proxy for severe anemia and
consequent low oxygen carrying capacity and delivery
to the tissues, potential contamination, and transfu￾sion related immunomodulation in presence of critical
illness [7, 33].
Most important strengths of our study are: 1) our
study was done using standard data collection methods
2) we collected data prospectively and did not use
computer generated codes 3) our risk factor analysis
included a large number of variable on patient charac￾teristics, operative detail and timing of antibiotic
prophylaxis 4) we calculated procedure specific SSI rates
5) all the surgeons participated 6) due to the study
design we could develop risk predicting statistical model.
Our study has certain limitations. We did not collect
socio-economic data and data on obesity, but most of
our patients belong to low socio-economic class and are
not obese, but could have malnutrition. We did not
calculate the cumulative experience of the operating
team for a given surgery, although we did know the over￾all experience of each member. This would have increased
the burden on our data collection team. Finally, lack of
antibiotic policy might have affected the SSI rates.
Conclusion
Incidence and risk factors from prospective SSI surveillance
can be reported simultaneously for the Obstetric and
Gynecological surgeries and can be part of routine practice
in resource-constrained settings. The incidence of SSI was
lower for Obstetric surgeries compared to Gynecological
surgeries. The study identified multiple risk factors for SSI
for Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries in a tertiary rural
hospital in India. Some of the risk factors identified are
amendable through interventions. Thus, the multiple risk
factors identified in the present study can be helpful for SSI
risk stratification and prioritizing interventions in low￾middle income countries.
