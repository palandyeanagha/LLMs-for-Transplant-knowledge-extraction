Abstract
Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
syndrome of chronic progressive airflow limitation which occurs as
a result of chronic inflammation of the airways and lung
parenchyma. However, the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the
treatment of COPD is controversial. We hypothesised that inhaled
corticosteroids reduce the progression of airflow limitation in
COPD.
Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted and
data were analysed using random effects methodology. The effect of
inhaled steroids on annual change in forced expiratory volume in 1
second (FEV1) was determined for all trials, for trials with high dose
treatment regimens, and for trials in subjects with moderate to
severe airflow limitation.
Results: Data from eight controlled clinical trials of ⩾2 years were
included (n=3715 subjects). Meta-analysis of all study data
revealed that inhaled corticosteroids reduce the rate of FEV1 decline
by 7.7 ml/year (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 14.2, p=0.02).
Meta-analysis of studies with high dose regimens revealed a greater
effect of 9.9 ml/year (95% CI 2.3 to 17.5, p=0.01) compared with
the meta-analysis of all studies.
Conclusions: Inhaled corticosteroid treatment for ⩾2 years slows


the rate of lung function decline in COPD. The effect observed with
high dose regimens is greater than that with all regimens combined.
These data suggest a potential role for inhaled corticosteroids in
modifying the long term natural history of COPD.
