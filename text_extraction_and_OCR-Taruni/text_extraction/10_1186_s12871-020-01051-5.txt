Abstract
Background: The volume effect of iso-oncotic colloid is supposedly larger than crystalloid, but such differences are
dependent on clinical context. The purpose of this single center observational study was to compare the volume
and hemodynamic effects of crystalloid solution and colloid solution during surgical manipulation in patients
undergoing major abdominal surgery.
Methods: Subjects undergoing abdominal surgery for malignancies with intraoperative goal-directed fluid
management were enrolled in this observational study. Fluid challenges consisted with 250 ml of either bicarbonate
Ringer solution, 6% hydroxyethyl starch or 5% albumin were provided to maintain optimal stroke volume index.
Hematocrit derived-plasma volume and colloid osmotic pressure was determined immediately before and 30 min
after the fluid challenge. Data were expressed as median (IQR) and statistically compared with Kruskal-Wallis test.
Results: One hundred thirty-nine fluid challenges in 65 patients were analyzed. Bicarbonate Ringer solution, 6%
hydroxyethyl starch and 5% albumin were administered in 42, 49 and 48 instances, respectively. Plasma volume
increased 7.3 (3.6–10.0) % and 6.3 (1.4–8.8) % 30 min after the fluid challenge with 6% hydroxyethyl starch and 5%
albumin and these values are significantly larger than the value with bicarbonate Ringer solution (1.0 (− 2.7–2.3) %)
Colloid osmotic pressure increased 0.6 (0.2–1.2) mmHg after the fluid challenge with 6% hydroxyethyl starch and
0.7(0.2–1.3) mmHg with 5% albumin but decreased 0.6 (0.2–1.2) mmHg after the fluid challenge with bicarbonate
Ringer solution. The area under the curve of stroke volume index after fluid challenge was significantly larger after
6% hydroxyethyl starch or 5% albumin compared to bicarbonate Ringer solution.
Conclusions: Fluid challenge with 6% hydroxyethyl starch and 5% albumin showed significantly larger volume and
hemodynamic effects compared to bicarbonate Ringer solution during gastrointestinal surgery.

Background
Recent investigations have demonstrated the benefits of
intraoperative goal-directed fluid management [1]. Al￾though the typical protocol recommends rapid adminis￾tration of rapidly degradable hydroxyethyl starch (HES)
solution in order to optimize stroke volume [2–7], crys￾talloid and iso-oncotic albumin (Alb) have also been
used for this purpose [8–10]. Traditionally, the distribu￾tion of fluid is thought to be dictated by the Starling
principle. In this paradigm, iso-oncotic fluid, such as 6%
HES and 5% Alb, remain in the vasculature, whereas iso￾tonic, non-oncotic fluids are equally distributed through￾out the entire extracellular space. Thus, iso-oncotic
fluids should demonstrate a 3- to 4-times larger volume
effect than crystalloid. Although this hypothesis is sup￾ported by the results of a study of healthy volunteers
[11], clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that
the difference in volume effect between colloid and crys￾talloid is much smaller than anticipated. Most available
evidence suggests that the volume effects of HES and
Alb are about 1.5 times larger than the volume effect of
crystalloid [12]; however, only a few reports have directly
compared volume and hemodynamic effects of crystal￾loid, HES, and Alb [10, 13]. Furthermore, the volume ef￾fect of an intravenous solution is typically assessed in
surgical patients before or after intraperitoneal manipu￾lation. Because volume effects are considered context￾sensitive, data collect during periods of surgical stress
and inflammation would be more clinically relevant than
data collect from healthy volunteers or from surgical pa￾tients before or after surgery.
The purpose of this study was to compare the volume
and hemodynamic effects of crystalloid, HES and Alb
during intraoperative goal-directed fluid management in
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
Methods
This prospective observational study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Toho University Ohashi Med￾ical Center (approval no. 14–13, approved on Feb. 10,
2014) and written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects participating in this study. This study was
registered prior to patient enrollment at UMIN Clinical
Trial Registry (www.umin.ac.jp/ctr; UMIN000017964).
During 18-month study period, we enrolled patients
scheduled to undergo major, elective abdominal surgery
for gastrointestinal, gynecological, or urological malig￾nancies at Toho University Ohashi Medical Center.
Patients were excluded from the study if they were
younger than 20 years, were pregnant, had an
arrhythmia, or underwent a laparoscopic procedure.
Prior to anesthesia induction, all study patients re￾ceived an epidural catheter at mid to low thoracic level.
General anesthesia was induced with combination of
propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl and maintained with
sevoflurane and remifentanil combined with intermittent
rocuronium administration. Initially, 6 to 8 ml of 0.375%
of ropivacaine was intermittently administered via epi￾dural catheter. The timing and the dose of supplemental
epidural ropivacaine were at the discretion of the attend￾ing anesthesiologists. Postoperatively, 0.2% ropivacaine
supplemented with fentanyl was continuously adminis￾tered via epidural catheter with elastometric pump. Pa￾tients were mechanically ventilated with a fixed tidal
volume of 8 ml kg− 1 of predicted body weight and a
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The re￾spiratory rate was adjusted to maintain an end-tidal car￾bon dioxide level between 3.5 and 4.5 kPa. Bicarbonate
Ringer’s solution (BRS; Bicanate, Ohtsuka Pharmaceut￾ical Factory, Tokushima, Japan) [14] was administered at
a rate of 1.5 ml kg− 1 h− 1
. Either the left or right radial
artery was cannulated with a 22-gauge Teflon catheter
(Introcan Safety; BBraun, Melsungen, Germany), and
stroke volume was continuously measured by non￾calibrated arterial pulse contour analysis (FloTrac/Vigi￾leo, ver. 3.04; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Air
bubbles were removed from the line and the arterial
catheter was carefully fixed at the wrist to prevent arter￾ial waveform distortion. A central venous catheter was
inserted when clinically necessary. The protocol of goal￾directed fluid management used in this study was a
modification of our previously reported protocol [15]
and is summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, the current protocol
aimed to achieve an individualized stroke volume index
(SVI) target by repeated fluid challenge [16]. Basically,
the SVI > 35 ml m− 2 was used to the target of intraoper￾ative hemodynamic target but target SVI up to 40 ml
m− 2 is allowed dependent on the attending
anesthesiologist discretion. Fluid challenges consisted of
250 ml of either BRS, 6% saline-based hydroxyethyl
starch 130/0.4 (Voluven; Fresenius-Kabi, Bad Homburg,
Germany, herein HES), or 5% albumin (CSL Behring,
King of Prussia, PA, herein Alb). Each fluid challenge
consisted of rapid injection of 250 ml fluid using a 50-ml
syringe [5, 17] and a typical fluid challenge was finished
in less than 5 min. BRS and HES were alternately used
for the fluid challenge during the majority of the intra￾operative period. In this study, Alb was selectively used
during the late phase of surgery in long cases and in
cases with significant blood loss. Additionally, phenyl￾ephrine was administered to maintain a mean arterial
pressure greater than 55 mmHg. If the SVI goal could
not be achieved with repeated fluid challenges, a small
dose of either dobutamine or norepinephrine was ad￾ministered. Other intraoperative care was at the discre￾tion of the attending anesthesiologist.
Immediately before each fluid challenge, heparinized
arterial blood was collected to determine the hematocrit

(Hct) and plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP). Hct
was measured using a standard blood gas analyzer
(Cobas b221; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
After centrifugation, plasma COP was measured using a
colloid osmometer (Model 4420; Wescor, UK) with a
semi-permeable membrane with a 30-kDa cutoff (SS￾030). COP analysis was repeated 30 min after the start of
each fluid challenge. This interval was based on our pre￾vious study wherein we found that the intraoperative
volume effect of crystalloid disappears after about 30
min [15]. This interval also corresponds with previous
volume kinetic studies that assessed the volume effect
30 min after the fluid infusion.
Data analysis
In order to eliminate the confounding effects of blood
loss and changes in vascular capacitance on the evalu￾ation of volume effect, fluid challenges were excluded if
they were concomitant with measurable blood loss,
within 2 h after an epidural bolus injection of local
anesthetic, vascular clamping/declamping, bolus admin￾istration or dose changes in the continuous infusion of

vasoactive drugs, and if an additional fluid challenge was
required during the 30-min observation period. The
change of plasma volume caused by each fluid challenge
was evaluated using the following formula [18]:
100  ð Þ pre‐challenge Hct=post‐challenge Hct‐1 =ð Þ 1‐pre‐challenge Hct :
The hemodynamic effects of each fluid challenge were
evaluated as follows. First, the trend of SVI was exam￾ined offline and the peak and duration of the SVI change
caused by each fluid challenge were determined by two
authors who were not involved in the intraoperative
management (DT and YK). Then, the time to peak SVI,
maximal SVI change, area under the curve of SVI
change above baseline, and mean arterial pressure
(MAP) change at the time of maximal SVI change were
determined and compared.
Statistical analysis was performed with customized ver￾sion of R software, ver. 3.4.4 (Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) [19] and Prism software,
ver. 7 (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). The
normality of distribution was examined with the
Shapiro-Wilk test. Data are expressed as either mean ±
SD or median (interquartile range (IQR)), according to
the distribution. Differences in the volume and
hemodynamic effects between the three fluids were ex￾amined with either one-way analysis of variance or the
Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the data distribution.
Either the Turkey test or Dunn’s test was used for post
hoc comparisons of BRS, HES, and Alb. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. In this study, we hy￾pothesized that the volume effect of colloid would be
50% larger than the volume effect of crystalloid. Based
on this hypothesis, we estimated that 40 measurements
for each fluid type were needed to achieve a beta error
less than 0.8 and an alpha error of 0.05.
Results
The flow of patients and data analysis is summarized in
Fig. 2. Of the 89 patients who met the inclusion criteria,
65 patients were included in the analysis. Most patients
underwent midline laparotomy while the patients under￾went hepatectomy received both midline laparotomy
and subcostal incision. Patient demographics and surgi￾cal data are summarized in Table 1, respectively. A total
of 391 fluid challenges were performed; however, 252
fluid challenges were excluded from the analysis based
on the predetermined exclusion criteria. Finally, 48 fluid

challenges with BRS, 49 fluid challenges with HES, and
42 fluid challenges with Alb were included in the ana￾lysis (Fig. 2). Since fluid challenges administered within
2 h of epidural administration of local anesthetics were
excluded, the mean interval between incision and each
analyzed fluid challenge was 210 ± 108 min for BRS,
209 ± 93 min for HES, and 309 ± 111 min for Alb. Most
of these fluid challenges occurred relatively late in the
surgery, especially during periods of significant surgical
stress due to intraperitoneal manipulation.
The median increase in plasma volume 30 min after
fluid challenge was 7.3% (IQR, 3.6 to 10.0%) with HES
and 6.3% (IQR, 1.4 to 8.8%) with Alb. Conversely, the
median increase in plasma after fluid challenge with BRS
was only 1.0% (IQR, 2.7 to 2.3%). Thus, the volume ef￾fects 30 min after fluid challenge with HES and Alb were
significantly greater than with BRS; however, there was
no significant difference between the volume effects of
HES and Alb (Fig. 3, left panel). Similarly, COP in￾creased by 0.6 mmHg (IQR, 0.2 to 1.2 mmHg) after fluid
challenge with HES and 0.7 mmHg (IQR, 0.2 to 1.3
mmHg) after fluid challenge with Alb; however, COP de￾creased by 0.6 mmHg (IQR, 0.2 to 1.2 mmHg) after fluid
challenge with BRS. Thus, COP changes after fluid chal￾lenges with HES or Alb were significantly greater than
after fluid challenge with BRS (Fig. 3, right panel). Not￾ably, there was no significant correlation between the
COP change and volume effect after fluid challenge with
any of the three study fluids (R2 between the volume ef￾fect after BRS, HES and Alb was 0.09, 0.17 and 0.02,
respectively).
The course of SVI after fluid challenge with each fluid
is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The time from the start of the
fluid challenge to the peak SVI was similar between the
three study fluids. The median SVI increase was 5 ml
m− 2 (IQR, 3 to 8 ml m− 2
) with BRS, 8 ml m− 2 (IQR, 5 to
12 ml m− 2
) with HES, and 5 ml m− 2 (IQR, 3 to 8 ml
m− 2
) with Alb. The maximal SVI was significantly
higher after fluid challenge with HES than with BRS or
Alb (p < 0.0001). After the fluid challenges, the median
area under the curve of SVI was 26 ml m− 2 (IQR, 11 to

Discussion
In this study, we compared the volume and
hemodynamic effects of fluid challenges with crystalloid,
6% HES 130/0.4, and 5% Alb during surgical manipula￾tion in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
We found greater hemodilution, as well as a larger in￾crease in COP and SVI, after fluid challenges with HES
and Alb than with crystalloid.
The current study has two distinct features. First, all
fluid challenges were rapid (finishing in less than 30
min). A meta-analysis by Toscani et al. revealed that
fluid challenges that finished in less than 30 min resulted
in a higher proportion of responders compared with
fluid challenges that took longer than 30 min [20]. Aya
et al. recently found that a 4 ml kg− 1 bolus over 5 min
was adequate to reliably discriminate fluid responders
from non-responders in post-cardiac surgical patients
[21]. Furthermore, Miller et al. recommended a fluid
challenge consisting of 5 consecutive injections of 50 ml
by syringe push for goal-directed fluid management,
which is the method adopted in the present study [5].
Collectively, our protocol corresponds well with recent
studies and likely represents the contemporary standard
of care for intraoperative goal-directed fluid manage￾ment. Second, the volume effects of each study fluid
were evaluated during actual surgical stress. Volume
effects of administered fluids are considered context￾sensitive [22, 23], and surgical manipulation and inflam￾matory response both increase vascular permeability,
resulting in a significant fluid shift from the intravascular
to the extravascular space [24–26]. Thus, the results of
this study may be more clinically relevant than studies of
healthy volunteers or surgical patients before or after
surgery.
Increases in plasma volume were sustained for at least
30 min after fluid challenge with HES or Alb, but not
with BRS. In patients undergoing major abdominal sur￾gery, intravascular volume may be continuously lost to
the interstitial space due to surgical stress and inflamma￾tion, as well as to the environment through evaporative
loss. These findings suggest that, despite these fluid
shifts, a significant proportion of administered HES or
Alb remains intravascular, whereas a significant amount
of administered BRS is lost from the vasculature after
30 min. Joosten and the colleagues analyzed the data of
existing trial and found that the initial hemodynamic
change during fluid challenge is independent of the
types of fluid [27]. They speculated that the lower num￾ber of boluses required to achieve hemodynamic target
might be related to the longer intravascular persistence
of the colloid solution. Our data support their specula￾tion that the volume effect of crystalloid and colloid so￾lutions becomes gradually different in the later phase
after fluid challenge. There was a slight increase in COP
30 min after fluid challenge with HES or Alb; however,
COP decreased 30 min after fluid challenge with BRS.
Two clinical studies of healthy volunteers demonstrated
slightly increased COP after colloid infusion [28, 29],
and our data are basically in line with these previous re￾ports. Therefore, we speculate that COP changes are at
least partially due to the different volume effects of col￾loid and crystalloid.
Since fluid administration is generally guided by either
subjective decision of the attending anesthesia providers
or objective hemodynamic parameters, the difference in
volume effects between crystalloid and colloid in many
clinical studies likely reflects differences in hemodynamic
effects. Unfortunately, reports with detailed hemodynamic
profiles after fluid challenges are rare. Aya et al. reported
that cardiac output peaked 1 min after fluid challenge with
250 ml crystalloid in postoperative ICU patients and the
effect was sustained for about 10 min after the completion
of the fluid challenge [17]. Gandos et al. reported that the
area under the curve of cardiac index was significantly
higher after fluid challenges with HES or Alb than with
crystalloid [13]. Our findings basically agree with these

previous reports; however, they also provide interesting in￾sights about the hemodynamic effects of fluid challenges.
Fluid challenge with HES resulted in a higher peak SVI
than fluid challenge with Alb; however, the area under the
curve of SVI was not statistically different between fluid
challenges with HES or Alb. Collectively, our data confirm
that colloid, such as HES and Alb, generate larger
hemodynamic effects than crystalloid. In addition, our
data support the observed differences in volume effects
between colloid and crystalloid [12, 30].
We believe that the results of this study have clinical
implications. HES was not associated with the improve￾ment of the majority of the outcomes despite the lower
fluid requirement in the recent large-scale randomized
trial. Instead, the authors found increased incidence of
low-stage AKI and concluded that use of HES is not
supported [31]. However, one of the co-authors of this
manuscript found that intraoperative HES use is associ￾ated with low stage AKI but is not associated with ad￾vanced stages of AKI, the use of renal replacement study
or increased mortality in the large retrospective study
[32]. Furthermore, slightly positive fluid balance at the
end of surgery is recommended based on the results of
large-scale trial [33, 34]. Such fluid balance may be
achieved without colloid in cases with 2 to 3 h of dur￾ation, we assume achieving such balance without colloid
is difficult during more invasive, extensive surgeries. In
this regard, we agree with the recent editorial comment
which supports the use of HES in the contemporary sur￾gical environment [35].
This study has several limitations. First, the context of
each fluid challenge significantly affects data interpret￾ation. We tried to minimize the influence of factors such
as blood loss, changes in vascular compliance (epidural
blockade and vasopressor use), and surgical manipula￾tion. Nevertheless, such adjustments still remain subject￾ive and cannot preclude the presence of confounding
factors. The robust results found in this study suggest
that the volume effects and subsequent hemodynamic
effects of the study fluids are real. Second, COP was de￾termined using a semipermeable filter with a cut-off
value of 30 kDa. The renal excretion threshold is around
50 kDa [36]; therefore, molecules with a molecular
weight between 30 and 50 kDa contribute to the COP
value measured by the osmometer but are not osmotic￾ally active in vivo. Because this issue is particularly rele￾vant to HES, this study may have overestimated the
effect of HES on COP. Third, we did not fully account
for the interaction between HES and BRS. Hahn et al.
reported that the volume effect of acetate Ringer’s solu￾tion was modified by the preceding administration of
HES [37]. Since all patients in the present study received
both HES and BRS, the results may be affected by this
interaction; however, we believe that the current
protocol represents a realistic balance of crystalloid and
colloid, which can maximize the benefits of goal￾directed fluid management and prevent dose-dependent
side effects of HES, especially in long cases. Fourth, this
study included a significant number of elderly patients
and the subjects with multiple comorbidities such as
with ASA PS 3, which may limit the generalizability of
these results. Fifth, the fluctuation of RBC size and Hct
during long surgical procedure may affect the accuracy
of plasma volume calculation. Sixth, several formulas
other than the one used in this study are used in the lit￾erature and it is not clear whether the current formula is
most adequate in this setting or not. Despite these limi￾tations, the current study demonstrates a significant dif￾ference in the volume and hemodynamic effects of
crystalloid and colloid during surgical manipulation
under general anesthesia.
In conclusion, this study showed that the increase in
plasma volume after rapid injection of crystalloid during
major abdominal surgery was almost completely lost
after 30 min. Conversely, rapid injection of both HES
and Alb resulted in significantly greater increases in
plasma volume and COP compared with BRS. Moreover,
increases in plasma volume were accompanied by con￾comitant increases in stroke volume. These results cor￾respond well with the results of other recent studies and
confirm that colloid can reduce the total fluid input dur￾ing goal-directed fluid management.
