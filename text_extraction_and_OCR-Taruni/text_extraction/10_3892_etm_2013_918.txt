Abstract. The incidence and clinical features of portopul￾monary hypertension (POPH) have not been adequately 
described and it is currently unknown whether an associa￾tion exists between the severity of POPH and liver function. 
Additionally, POPH risk factors are yet to be identified. The 
aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, describe 
the clinical features and investigate the potential risk factors 
of POPH. We conducted a study of 100 cirrhotic patients 
hospitalized between March 2011 and May 2012 at Tongji 
Hospital in Shanghai. The clinical characteristics of patients 
with and without POPH were analyzed. Clinical variables 
with a possible association with POPH were measured and 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was determined 
by cardiac Doppler echocardiography. Of the 100 patients 
enrolled in this study, 10 were diagnosed with POPH. Seven 
of the cases were mild, two were moderate and only one was 
severe; eight were attributed to viral infections. POPH was not 
detected in patients with schistosomal or alcoholic cirrhosis. 
Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were lower in patients with POPH 
compared to those without POPH (P<0.01) and the severity 
of POPH was not significantly correlated with Child-Pugh 
grade (R=-0.06, P=0.09). Hb levels, incidence of hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection and portal vein thrombosis differed 
between the two groups (P<0.05). Hb levels were identified 
as an independent risk factor associated with POPH and 
portal vein thrombosis may play an important role during the 
development of POPH. However, the severity of POPH was 
not associated with liver function. 
Introduction
Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) refers to the condition 
of simultaneous pulmonary arterial and portal hypertension. 
Hemodynamically, it is defined as a mean pulmonary artery 
pressure (MPAP) >25 mmHg and normal volume status or 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) <15 mmHg 
in patients with chronic liver disease and portal hyperten￾sion (1-3). POPH has been reported in ~6-9% of patients 
with advanced liver disease, that are referred for liver trans￾plants (4,5). This variation in prevalence results from the 
different groups of cirrhotic patients studied and different 
diagnostic procedures used.
Clinical manifestations of portal hypertension typically 
precede those of pulmonary artery hypertension by 2-15 years. 
The most common symptoms of POPH include dyspnea 
upon exertion, syncope, chest pain, fatigue, hemoptysis and 
orthopnea. The presence of molecular markers is also likely, as 
one study supported the hypothesis that pulmonary vasculature 
may be exposed to either cytokines or excess circulating vaso￾constrictors, including interleukin-6 and endotoxin produced 
by the diseased liver (6). However, to date, the predictors of 
and biological mechanism responsible for the development of 
this complication remain unknown.
There are no known clinical factors that determine the risk 
of POPH in patients with advanced liver disease. Similarly, 
the mechanism for pulmonary vascular obliteration in patients 
with portal hypertension, characterized by systemic vasodila￾tion remains unclear. It follows that the identification of patient 
characteristics associated with an increase or decrease in the 
probability of developing POPH may not only be clinically 
useful, but may also shed light on the etiology of this relatively 
common comorbidity of portal hypertension. Therefore, the 
aims of this study were to explore the clinical features of 
POPH and to identify risk factors associated with POPH in 
cirrhotic patients.
Patients and methods
Patients. From March 2011 to May 2012, 145 consecutive 
adult patients with cirrhosis (102 males, 43 females) from 
our hospital were enrolled in the study. The only inclusion 
criterion was the presence of clinical portal hypertension

with intrinsic liver cirrhosis. Patients with significant obstruc￾tive lung disease, restrictive ventilatory defects, human 
immunodeficiency virus, severe aortic or mitral stenosis, 
regurgitation or significant left ventricular dysfunction were 
excluded. Also excluded were individuals with hepatocel￾lular carcinoma or any other malignancy, known hemostatic 
disorders other than liver disease, bacterial infection, a clinical 
history of peripheral venous thrombosis or Budd-Chiari 
syndrome, spleen resection, lung and liver transplantation 
and those receiving endoscopic treatment or anticoagulation 
therapy. A total of 100 patients were considered acceptable 
and were enrolled in our study. Informed consent was obtained 
from all patients and the study was carried out according to the 
principles of the declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of 
the institutional ethics committee.
Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by clinical findings or 
morphology and liver function of the POPH patients was scored 
using the Child-Pugh classification (7). Past medical history 
and social history were recorded. Non-invasive screening for 
POPH was performed and evaluated by Doppler echocardiog￾Table I. Demographic and clinical features of the ten cirrhotic patients with POPH.

raphy. In order to identify risk factors associated with POPH, 
the patients were classified into two groups: a POPH group 
[pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) ≥40 mmHg] and a 
non-POPH group (PASP <40 mmHg) (8,9). 
Diagnosis of POPH. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 
is considered an essential feature of POPH. Diagnostic 
measurements of PVR are traditionally obtained by right 
heart catheterization (RHC) (10,11); however, since bleeding 
complications are a concern among cirrhotic patients, other 
forms of diagnosis are preferred. Results of Doppler echocar￾diography are comparable to RHC in non-cirrhotic patients 
with pulmonary hypertension (12,13). For cirrhotic patients 
undergoing liver transplantation (14,15), it decreases the 
requirement for repeated invasive measurements. In our study, 
PASP (measured by Doppler echocardiography) was used to 
diagnose POPH.
Noninvasive color Doppler echocardiographies were 
performed on all patients. The MPAP was calculated from 
PASP (MPAP = 0.61 PASP + 2 mmHg). PASP values of 
38-54 mmHg were considered to represent mild POPH, 
55-69 mmHg were moderate and values ≥70 mmHg were 
severe (16).
Collection and analysis of blood samples. Blood samples 
(20 ml) were collected from patients following at least 12 h 
of fasting. Hemoglobin (Hb) and blood platelet count (BPC) 
were determined using a Sysmex XE-2100 automated 
analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Total bilirubin (TBIL) and 
albumin (ALB) were determined using diazotization and the 
bromocresol green (BCG) assay method, respectively (Roche 
Cobas-c702, Germany). D-dimer and high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hs-CRP) levels were detected using the corresponding 
kits from Sun Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), following 
the manufacturer's instructions. Prothrombin time (PT), 
activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) and fibrinogen 
(Fib) were determined by routine coagulation methods with 
a coagulation detector, using a Sysmex CA-6000 automated 
analyzer (Sysmex, Milton Keynes, UK). Intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon-α (IFN-α) and tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immuno￾sorbent assay (ELISA).
Statistical analysis. The SPSS software package for Windows 
(SPSS version 11.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used 
for statistical analysis. Continuous data were summarized 
using mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile

range), as appropriate. Categorical variables were displayed 
as frequencies. Statistical analysis was performed using the 
appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. Differences 
between the POPH and non-POPH groups were evaluated 
by Chi-square test. For continuous data, the assumption of 
normality was evaluated using a normality test. The Pearson 
Chi-square test, corrected Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test 
were used, as appropriate. Multivariate binary logistic regres￾sion was performed to evaluate the correlation between the 
presence of portal vein thrombosis and thrombotic risk factors 
with respect to the odds of occurrence for an event. The model 
was estimated using a backward stepwise method (Wald). 
In this multivariate analysis, we used a number of variables, 
including those that were not significant univariate predictors, 
since they may contribute to a multiple regression model in 
unforeseen ways due to complex intercorrelations among 
them. The coefficients obtained from the logistic regression 
analyses were also expressed in terms of odds ratios (ORs) with 
95% confidence intervals. Considering the number of cases, 
we determined that the final multivariate model should include 
≤4 predictors to prevent overfitting. A two-tailed P-value ≤0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. 
Results
Clinical features. Ten of the 100 study patients (10%) were 
diagnosed with POPH. Five of these (50%) were males aged 
30-79 years (bivariate correlation analysis was used) with a 
mean age of 59.0±24.0 years. Five (50%) were females aged 
62-82 years, with a mean age of 73.0±9.0 years. The median 
age of the 10 POPH patients was 66 years. With regard to 
the etiology of subjects, eight of the POPH patients had viral 
cirrhosis [hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or 
HBV and HCV], one had autoimmune cirrhosis and one had 
cryptogenic cirrhosis. POPH was not observed in schistosomal 
or alcoholic cirrhosis patients. Among the ten POPH patients, 
PASP values were 40-70 mmHg. The severity of POPH in the 
subjects is listed in Table I. 
Clinical symptoms or signs. The presentations of the decom￾pensate liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, including 
jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, edema and gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage were observed in the cirrhotic patients with 
POPH. Although a number of patients with POPH are asymp￾tomatic (17), other POPH patients presented with syndromes 
and signs of pulmonary hypertension. Two patients presented 
dyspnea upon exertion, two with syncope, one with chest pain 
and one with hemoptysis.
Risk factors analysis. There were no significant differences in 
age or gender between the POPH and the non-POPH groups 
(mean age, 66.0±18.0 vs. 61.6±13.9 years; P=0.86, P=0.15, 
respectively). Of the etiologies studied, only the prevalence 
of HCV-related cirrhosis patients differed between the two 
groups (P=0.001). With regards to liver function, we identi￾fied that one POPH patient was Child-Pugh grade A, six were 
grade B and three were grade C. There were no significant 
differences in Child-Pugh grade between the two groups 
(P=0.76). With regard to the severity of POPH, liver damage 
was mild in seven patients, moderate in two patients and 
severe in one patient. With respect to past medical history 
only the incidence of portal vein thrombosis differed signifi￾cantly between the POPH and non-POPH groups (P=0.02; 
Tables II and III).
The levels of BPC, ALB, TBIL, Hs-CRP, D-dimer, 
thrombin time (TT), Fib, ICAM-1, IFN-α and TFN-α did not 
differ significantly between POPH and non-POPH patients. 
There were no significant differences in the levels of APTT 
and PT between the two groups. However, the levels of Hb 
were lower in the POPH group than those in the non-POPH 
groups (P=0.001). Hb was determined to be a risk factor of 
POPH by univariate analysis (Table IV).

Correlation between Child-Pugh class and severity of 
POPH. In our study, a correlation between Child-Pugh class 
and severity of POPH (reflected by the value of PASP) was 
investigated. The results revealed that the PASP values were 
not significantly correlated with Child-Pugh class (R=-0.06, 
P=0.09; Fig. 1).
Multivariate analysis. The Hb, HCV, D-dimer and portal vein 
thrombosis were included in multivariate logistic regression 
analysis. Only Hb was identified as an independent factor asso￾ciated with an increased risk of POPH (OR=0.952; Table V).
Discussion
In the present study, POPH was diagnosed in 10% of patients 
with cirrhosis. This is within the range of prevalence reported 
in the literature (20). In previous studies, POPH has been 
estimated to occur with a prevalence of 16.1% in patients with 
cirrhosis and refractory ascites and 0.25-4% in patients with 
cirrhosis without refractory ascites (18,19). 
Although our results demonstrated that there are higher 
percentages of females with cirrhosis that develop POPH, no 
significant difference was observed in the incidence of POPH 
across the gender (results not shown). This indicates that males 
and females with cirrhosis are at risk of developing POPH. 
These results contradict the findings of a previous study that 
identified that females are at a higher risk of POPH (11). 
In our study, the majority of the POPH patients had viral 
cirrhosis (HBV and HCV). Viral cirrhosis was the most 
common type of cirrhosis among our Chinese population; 
however, our results demonstrated that a higher incidence 
of POPH exists among patients with viral cirrhosis. While 
previous research identified that HCV infection was negatively 
correlated with POPH (11), this was not supported by our data. 
In contrast, the high incidence of POPH among patients with 
HCV infection indicates that patients with HCV cirrhosis may 
be at higher risk of developing POPH.
With regard to the severity of POPH, our results demon￾strated that the severity of POPH is unrelated to liver function, 
as we were unable to identify an association between POPH 
severity and Child-Pugh class. However, this conclusion 
is based on a small number of cases and larger studies are 
required to verify this correlation.
Previously hypothesized risk factors of POPH were not 
associated with POPH in our study. Age, gender and Child￾Pugh class did not differ between the POPH and non-POPH 
groups. Also, hepatic complications, including GI hemor￾rhage, hepatorenal syndrome ascites and encephalopathy did 
not differ between the groups. Similarly, HBP, DM, coronary 
artery disease, drug use and blood transfusion did not appear 
to affect the risk of developing POPH and smoking and alcohol 
use were common in the two groups. 
With respect to patient medical histories, only portal vein 
thrombosis differed between the two groups, indicating that 
portal vein thrombosis is associated with POPH. These results 
are supported by a previous study that described microembolism 
of the lungs in hepatic fibrosis due to recurrent cholangitis. The 
passage of small emboli to the lungs was attributed to the pres￾ence of small hepatic arteriovenous fistulae (21). The correlation 
between POPH and portal vein thrombosis may be explained 
by a similar anatomical mechanism. Portal venous obstruction 
secondary to portal vein thrombosis would likely enlarge such 
communications, resulting in repeated microembolism of the 
lungs. This may lead to pulmonary hypertension and, ultimately, 
congestive failure due to chronic cor pulmonale (21). 
Among the laboratory parameters examined in our study, 
levels of Hb were lower in the POPH group than in the 
non‑POPH group. To our knowledge, a correlation between 
POPH and Hb has not been described previously. However, it 
is known that a decrease in Hb leads to a significant increase 
in cardiac output and exacerbated hyperdynamic splanchnic 
circulation (22). The hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation is 
a major contributor to portal hypertension. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that Hb levels were significantly lower in the POPH 
group and that Hb level was the only variable independently 
associated with POPH. These findings indicate that Hb level is 
an independent risk factor and plays a key role in the develop￾ment of POPH. While HCV and PVT were also associated with 
a higher incidence of POPH, these factors were not independent 
predictors of POPH. Perhaps they contributed to the formation 
of POPH through interactions with other unknown factors. 
However, significant differences between the two groups were 
not observed for any of the other markers that we investigated.
In conclusion, within our study population POPH was 
present in 10% of cirrhotic patients. It was most common among 
patients with viral cirrhosis and absent among schistosomal 
and alcoholic cirrhosis patients. Notably, the severity of POPH 
was unrelated to liver function (Child-Pugh classification). 
HCV infection and portal vein thrombosis may play important 
roles during the development of POPH; however, Hb level is 
the only significant, independent predictor of POPH. Future 
studies should examine the mechanistic role of these factors in 
the development of POPH.
