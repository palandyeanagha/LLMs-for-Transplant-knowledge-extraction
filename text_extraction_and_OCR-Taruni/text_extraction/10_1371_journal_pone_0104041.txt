Abstract
Background: Little information is known about factors that influence perioperative and anesthesia-related cardiac arrest
(CA) in older patients. This study evaluated the incidence, causes and outcome of intraoperative and anesthesia-related CA
in older patients in a Brazilian teaching hospital between 1996 and 2010.
Methods: During the study, older patients received 18,367 anesthetics. Data collected included patient characteristics,
surgical procedures, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthesia type, medical specialty team
and outcome. All CAs were categorized by cause into one of four groups: patient’s disease/condition-related, surgery￾related, totally anesthesia-related or partially anesthesia-related.
Results: All intraoperative CAs and deaths rates are shown per 10,000 anesthetics. There were 100 CAs (54.44; 95%
confidence intervals [CI]: 44.68–64.20) and 68 deaths (37.02; 95% CI: 27.56–46.48). The majority of CAs were patient’s
disease-/condition-related (43.5; 95% CI: 13.44–73.68). There were six anesthesia-related CAs (3.26; 95% CI: 0.65–5.87) - 1
totally and 5 partially anesthesia-related, and three deaths, all partially anesthesia-related (1.63; 95% CI: 0.0–3.47). ASA I-II
physical status patients presented no anesthesia-related CA. Anesthesia-related CA, absent in the last five years of the study,
was due to medication-/airway-related causes. ASA physical status was the most important predictor of CA (odds ratio:
14.52; 95% CI: 4.48–47.08; P,0.001) followed by emergency surgery (odds ratio: 8.07; 95% CI: 5.14–12.68; P,0.001).
Conclusions: The study identified high incidence of intraoperative CAs with high mortality in older patients. The large
majority of CAs were caused by factors not anesthesia-related. Anesthesia-related CA and mortality rates were 3.26 and 1.63
per 10,000 anesthetics, with no anesthesia-related CA in the last five years of the study. Major predictors of intraoperative
CAs were poorer ASA physical status and emergency surgery. All anesthesia-related CAs were medication-related or airway￾related, which is important for prevention strategies.

Introduction
The global population is ageing. According to the World Health
Organization, people $60 years old in developing countries, such
as Brazil, are considered elderly [1]. A significant proportion of
older people are living with chronic diseases, such as cardiovas￾cular disease, cognitive impairments and a reduced physiological
reserve, which remain a challenge for all areas of medicine [2].
Few studies on perioperative cardiac arrest (CA) and mortality
carried out exclusively in geriatric patients undergoing all types of
surgery have been published [3–6]. However, there are no studies
on anesthesia-related CA and death exclusively in elderly patients.
Therefore, little information is known about factors that influence
intraoperative and anesthesia-related CA and death in older
surgical patients.
A survey performed from 1996 to 2005 in a Brazilian general
tertiary teaching hospital [7] and other studies that included
patients of all age groups [8,9], found that the perioperative CA
and mortality rates were higher in older adults than in young
adults. Recognizing the importance of identification of high-risk
patients to guide the planning, resourcing, and expert staffing
required to enhance the safety and improve the anesthesia
outcomes for older patients, our institution developed initiatives
for the purpose of improving the care of surgical patients. This
involved the organization of services for the care of older patients,
including the operating room (OR) materials and equipments such
as anesthesia workstations with ventilators to provide adequate
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104041

ventilation and monitoring, and devices for temperature control,
new drugs for anesthesia induction and increasing the number of
adult intensive care beds.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, triggering
factors, causes and outcome of intraoperative and anesthesia￾related CA in older surgical patients over a 15-yr period in a
Brazilian general tertiary teaching hospital.
Methods
The project was approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committee of the Botucatu Medical School (Ref: 3694-2010), who
waived the requirement for written informed consent. This survey
analyzed all reported CA in 18,367 consecutive anesthetics given
to all older patients at least 60 years of age requiring anesthesia
services at the Hospital of the Botucatu Medical School,
Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil,
a public tertiary teaching hospital, from January 1, 1996 to
December 31, 2010. The UNESP hospital is a 450-bed tertiary￾care referral facility with a catchment of 2 million people that
performs approximately 7,000 surgeries per year on people of all
age groups. The hospital has a 33-bed adult intensive care unit.
The basic safety monitoring protocol in the OR during regional
and neuroaxial anesthesia and sedation included electrocardio￾gram, automatic non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry.
For general anesthesia were measured the core temperature,
ventilation parameters, capnography and oxygen concentration.
After 2005 the delivered nitrous oxide and halogenated anesthetic
vapour concentrations were also measured. Critically ill patients
received invasive blood pressure and central venous pressure
monitoring. The same basic monitoring described for the OR was
also used in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
Cardiac arrests and deaths in older patients in the OR and
PACU were identified through an anesthesia database developed
from a quality assessment form that is part of the mandatory
documentation for each anesthetic procedure. The forms were
completed by the anesthesia staff responsible for each administra￾tion of anesthetic. The recorded data included the date and
location; patient characteristics; American Society of Anesthesiol￾ogists (ASA) physical status classification; surgical procedures
(elective, urgent or emergency surgery); medical specialty team;
anesthesia type (general, regional or monitored and supportive
anesthesia care associated or not with local anesthesia in critically
ill patients); outcome; and a 95-item checklist of airway,
respiratory, cardiocirculatory, neurological, renal and miscella￾neous events related to the OR or PACU stay.
Cardiac arrest was defined as the cessation of cardiac
mechanical activity with loss of effective circulation determined
by the absence of a palpable central pulse. The resuscitation was
performed according to the interventions and protocols for
Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines.
The anesthetist responsible for each case of CA was asked to
review the case and provide a written summary for peer review.
The medical and anesthesia records, the written summary, and,
when applicable, the necropsy report were analyzed by the
Anesthesia Cardiac Arrest Study Commission, which was com￾posed of three authors who are faculty members in the
Department of Anesthesiology (YMMC, JRCB and LGB). The
triggering factors of CA and death were retrospectively assigned to
one of four groups: (1) totally related to the surgery when a
technical surgical problem was the only or the major contributory
factor, (2) totally related to an older patient’s disease or condition,
(3) totally related to anesthesia when anesthesia was the only or the
major contributory factor or (4) partially related to anesthesia
when an older patient’s condition/disease or surgical procedure
was a factor additional to anesthesia in the CA or death.
Unanimity was reached on the triggering factors in the majority
of the CAs and deaths. Disagreements among the three members
were resolved by discussion, and agreement was reached in all
cases when at least two of the three members agreed on the
triggering factors.
Some of the CAs in the current study were likely included in our
previous study that examined perioperative CAs in all age groups
from April 1996 to March 2005, but did not evaluate CAs in older
patients exclusively [7]. Thus, only some of these older patients
who experienced intraoperative CA (48) are included in the
numerator in the present study whereas all of the older patients
(6,796 who received anesthesia) are included in the denominator.
Statistical analysis
The incidence (expressed per 10,000 anesthetics) and 95%
confidence interval (CI) of intraoperative CA and mortality were
calculated according to age, sex, ASA physical status, surgical
procedures, anesthetic technique, surgical area and triggering
factors. In these cases, the difference between rates were
considered statistically significant if their respective 95% CIs did
not overlap. Factors predicting intraoperative CA (age, sex, ASA
physical status, surgical procedures and anesthesia technique) were
analyzed with multivariate forward stepwise logistical regression
with odds ratio and 95% CI reported. The conditional indepen￾dence of all variables and stratifications was verified by the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test while the homogeneity of the odds
ratio was validated by the Breslow-Day test. The statistical analysis
was performed using the software Statistical Package for Social
Sciences for Windows (version 17.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). A P value,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Over the 15 years of the study, 18,367 older patients were
anesthetized. One hundred CAs (54.44 per 10,000 anesthetics;
95% CI: 44.68–64.20) and 68 deaths (37.02 per 10,000
anesthetics; 95% CI: 27.56–46.48) were identified within the
intraoperative period (OR and PACU). Thus, only 32% of the
older patients who experienced intraoperative CA survived. The
majority of CAs and deaths occurred in the OR (93% and
94.12%, respectively) compared with the PACU (7% and 5.88%,
respectively).
The intraoperative CA and death incidence in older surgical
patients increased with the ASA physical status classification, in
emergency surgery (12:1 compared with elective surgery) (Ta￾ble 1). General anesthesia (6.6:1 compared with neuroaxial
anesthesia) and an older patient’s disease/condition were impor￾tant factors of intraoperative CA (13.4:1 compared with anesthesia
and 5.7:1 compared with surgery) and death (Tables 2 and 3,
respectively). Multiclinical (two or more surgical areas) per 10,000
anesthetics (1034; 95% CI: 706–1,362), cardiac (412; 95% CI:
158–665), vascular (124; 95% CI: 61–185), thoracic (58; 95% CI:
24–91) or gastroenterological surgery (56; 95% CI: 10–102) were
also important CA factors.
Poorer ASA physical status (III–V), emergency surgery and
general anesthesia were significant predictive factors of intraop￾erative CA and death in older patient (Tables 4 and 5,
respectively). However, age and sex were not predictors of
intraoperative CA or mortality (Tables 4 and 5, respectively).
Anesthesia-related CA was considered a contributing factor in 5
cases and a primary factor in 1 case. Furthermore, anesthesia was
considered a contributing factor in all 3 anesthesia-related deaths

(Table 3). With regard to the triggering factors, 50% of the older
patients who experienced anesthesia-related CAs survived, com￾pared with 28.6% in the cases of surgery-related CAs and 31.25%
in those of patient condition-/disease-related CAs. All anesthesia￾related CAs and deaths in older surgical patients occurred from
1996 to 2005 at rates of 5.42 (95% CI: 1.2–9.6) and 2.7 (95% CI:
0.0–5.7) per 10,000 anesthetics, respectively, against CA and
mortality rates of zero per 10,000 anesthetics in the 2006–2010
period.
Additional information on the 94 intraoperative CAs and 65
deaths attributable to an older patient’s disease/condition or
surgery factors is provided in Table 6. Sepsis and multiple organ
failure were the most common causes of CA, while a ruptured
aneurysm was the most common cause of mortality.
Medication-related adverse events accounted for four (66.66%)
anesthesia-related CAs, three of which were caused by cardiovas￾cular collapse after neuroaxial anesthesia. Of these three patients,
two ASA physical status IV older patients passed away in the OR
during vascular surgery (lower limb amputation) while undergoing
continuous epidural anesthesia. In the third patient, a 63-year-old
male with an ASA physical status of III who suffered a femur
fracture in a motor vehicle accident, and had multiple rib
fractures, the CA occurred after the administration of a spinal
anesthetic with hyperbaric bupivacaine (20 mg). Immediately after
anesthesia induction, he developed hypotension and bradycardia,
followed by cardiovascular collapse and CA. In this case, CA was
attributed entirely to the anesthesia. Fortunately, the patient was
successfully resuscitated and recovered completely. There was 1
case of fluid overload followed by acute pulmonary edema in the
PACU after general anesthesia in a female patient with an ASA
physical status of III and a medical history of chronic renal failure.
This patient passed away.
Respiratory events accounted for two (33.33%) anesthesia￾related CAs. In both cases, there was loss of airway and difficulty
to intubate while the patients had significant underlying disease
with an ASA physical status of III or IV. One patient with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus had a cervical
abscess and mediastinitis; intubation and ventilation were difficult
after general anesthesia induction followed by hypoxemia,
cardiovascular collapse and CA. The patient was successfully
resuscitated and recovered. In another case, a patient, with atrial
fibrillation after thoracoscopy to drain a pleural effusion,
undergoing general anesthesia presented hypoventilation after
tracheal extubation in the PACU followed by a difficult
intubation, hypoxemia and CA. The patient was successfully
resuscitated and recovered with myocardial infarction.
Discussion
The main findings in this study were: (i) older patients continued
to present high incidence of intraoperative CA with high mortality;
(ii) anesthesia-related CA and mortality rates were 3.26 and 1.63
per 10,000 anesthetics, respectively; (iii) there was no anesthesia￾related CA in ASA I–II physical status patients; (iv) there were no
anesthesia-related CA and deaths rates in the last five years of the
study; (v) the large majority of CAs (94%) and deaths (95.5%) that
occurred during anesthesia were caused by factors not anesthesia￾related, and (vi) ASA physical status and emergency surgery, but
not age and sex, were significant predictors of intraoperative CA
and death in older patients.
A study conducted in Thailand in older surgical patients
reported a 24-hour perioperative death rate of 39.33 per 10,000
anesthetics [5]. Another Thai study reported 24-hour periopera￾tive CA and death rates of 40.42 and 31.44 per 10,000 anesthetics,

respectively, in older patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery
[3]. A previous survey of the perioperative CA rate in all age
groups conducted at our institution revealed a higher incidence of
perioperative CA in older patients of 70.62 per 10,000 anesthetics
[7]. A few other studies conducted in developed countries in the
last decade reported lower perioperative CA rates ranging from
10.73 to 16.08 per 10,000 anesthetics in older surgical patients
[9,10]. A systematic review [11] and a meta-analysis [12] of the
literature verified that perioperative mortality rates reported in
surgical patients of all age groups were higher in developing than
in developed countries.
It is difficult to compare the intraoperative CA and mortality
rates in our study with the results of previous studies (Table 7)
because of considerable differences in the methods and patient
populations among studies [3,5–10,13–16]. There is no consensus
in the literature regarding the definition of perioperative and
anesthesia-related mortality [17].
Some perioperative CA studies excluded ASA V older patients
[8], cardiac surgery [3,6,9,13,16] or trauma [9] and transplant
surgeries [9,16]. Therefore, the inclusion of both all surgery types
and poorer ASA physical status patients, resulting from certain
pre-existing morbidities, certainly influenced our CA and death
rates. Ninety-seven percent of the intraoperative CAs occurred in
poorer ASA physical status (III–V) patients with sepsis and
multiple organ failure being the most important causes (30.8%).
Sepsis occurs at a high incidence in Brazil and other developing
countries with high mortality [18].
The elderly are more predisposed to vascular disease than
young persons. Thus, a ruptured aneurysm, or complications
associated with cardiac surgery or intraoperative myocardial
infarction were also important causes of intraoperative CA and
death attributed to an older patient’s disease/condition or surgical
factors in the current study. Our study demonstrated that patients
presenting a poorer ASA physical status (III–V) were more likely
(14-fold) to suffer intraoperative CA than ASA I–II patients.
Previous studies have shown a similar association of perioperative
CA and mortality with poorer ASA physical status in the older
individuals [3,5,6]. In our study, it was verified that many older
patients arrived at the OR in poor health. Intraoperative CAs and
deaths that occurred in some of these patients might have been

prevented by an adequate preoperative assessment. A study
showed that perioperative death might have been prevented by
anesthesia care in approximately 1 per 13,900 anesthetics [19].
These findings demonstrate a persistent need to improve the
quantity and quality of resource utilization and access to
healthcare, which are inadequate in Brazil and in other developing
countries. In addition, it is necessary to adopt perioperative
medical practices with demonstrable effectiveness, organize
multidisciplinary discussion of adverse effects and implement of
evidence-based safety protocols to improve perioperative patient
care [20,21].
As demonstrated in our study and in others [3,5,6], the urgency
of surgery is a well-established preoperative predictive factor for
intraoperative CA and mortality in older patients. The risk of CA
in emergency surgery is likely due to many factors, such as the
impossibility of adequate evaluation and optimization of the
patients before the surgery.
Despite the differences in methodology, studies [6–10,15] have
suggested that anesthesia-related CA and mortality rates in older
people are lower today than they were 40 years ago (35.91 per
10,000 anesthetics) [14]. Most studies performed in the last two
decades in developed countries have reported in older patients
anesthesia-related death rates ranging from 0.00 to 1.72 per
10,000 anesthetics [8,15,19], which represents an improvement of
almost twenty-fold. Our study confirmed this trend (i.e., 1.63
anesthesia-related deaths per 10,000 anesthetics in its entire
timeframe and zero per 10,000 anesthetics in its last five years in
older patients). These data may be associated with the improve￾ments achieved in the geriatric anesthesia safety in our institution
in the recent years.

Intraoperative Cardiac Arrest and Its Mortality in Older Patients
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104041

In contrast to our current study, many prior works have
identified advanced age (.75 yr) as a risk factor for perioperative
CA [3,6,8,15], and also did not find age itself to be an independent
risk factor [10].
Sex was not a risk factor for intraoperative CA in our study. Sex
is known to be a significant risk factor for perioperative CA and
mortality in young men suffering from trauma [7]. In our study,
trauma was the fifth highest cause of intraoperative CA and death
in older surgical patients. The elderly are less predisposed to
trauma and violence than young persons.
Our study showed that general anesthesia was a predictor of
intraoperative CA. However, this may be attributable to the fact
that many high-risk surgeries (cardiac, thoracic, vascular, gastro￾enterological) in older patients were performed under general
anesthesia. Another possible confounding factor in this case is that
the anesthesiologist often prefers to give general anesthesia to the
most fragile patients, independently of the type of surgery.
In our study, respiratory causes of anesthesia-related CA were
less frequent (33%) than medication causes (67%). In a recent
study in all age groups [22], the authors verified that 64% of
anesthesia-related CAs were caused by airway complications.
There were three cases of CA after the administration of
neuroaxial anesthesia. After neuroaxial anesthesia, a condition in
which the loss of sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction may
decrease vascular resistance, and the loss of sympathetically
mediated cardiac stimulation may diminish both the heart rate
and stroke volume. The vasodilatation may permit the peripheral
pooling of blood and lower the end-diastolic volume, stroke
volume and cardiac output in older patients [23]. In the last five
years of our study, we preferentially used isobaric bupivacaine for
spinal anesthesia in older patients. This local anesthetic determines
lower levels of sympathetic block with lower cardiovascular effects
than hyperbaric bupivacaine in older patients [24].
There may have been some methodological weaknesses in our
study. First, the data are derived from adverse events reported by
faculty and residents. Underreporting is likely in this situation,
even though filling out the form for each case was mandatory. To
minimize the risk of underreporting CAs and deaths, the
information was cross-checked with the operating theater records
and hospital administration. Second, this study is representative of
the experience in one tertiary referral center. Practices specific to
our institution may have influenced our results and may not
represent the entire spectrum of elderly patient care practices. A
multi-institutional anesthesia database would not only provide
useful insights into injury mechanisms, but would also facilitate the
development of universally applicable strategies [25].
Conclusions
Our study has identified high incidence of intraoperative CA
with high mortality in older patients. The majority of CAs and
deaths were caused by factors not related to anesthesia.
Anesthesia-related CA and death rates were 3.26 and 1.63 per
10,000 anesthetics, respectively. Improvements achieved in
anesthesia safety in the older patients in our institution allowed
no anesthesia-related CA and mortality in the last five years of the
study and no anesthesia-related CA in ASA I-II physical status
older patients. Major predictor of CA and death was a
preoperative indicator of health, the ASA physical status, followed
by emergency surgery. The fact that all anesthesia-related CAs
were associated with medication administration or airway
management is important for the development of prevention
strategies. The high fatality rate in older surgical patients due to
poor physical status suggests that primary prevention might be the
key to reducing mortality from intraoperative CA. These findings
indicate the need to improve medical perioperative practices for
older people with highly complex medical problems in a
demonstrably effective manner in under-resourced settings.
