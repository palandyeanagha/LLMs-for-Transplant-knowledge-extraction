Abstract
Background: Family history of liver cancer is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study,
we investigated the prognosis of patients with HCC with or without family history.
Methods: Data for 1,313 patients who underwent hepatectomy as initial treatment for HCC between 2000 and
2008 at a tertiary cancer center hospital were retrieved from a prospective database. A positive family history was
defined as a self-reported history of HCC in first-degree relatives. Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared
by family history. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regressions were applied for overall survival
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
Results: Of 1,313 patients, 169 patients (12.9%) had first-degree relatives with a history of HCC. There were no
significant differences between patients with or without family history in basic clinicopathologic characteristics. In
either whole group or each stage according to the TNM staging system, first-degree family history was not
associated with survival in all patients, hepatitis B virus-positive patients, as well as male patients. Multivariate
analysis revealed that first-degree family history was not a prognostic factor, either for OS or DFS.
Conclusion: A first-degree family history of HCC is not associated with its patients’ prognosis after hepatectomy.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
cancer worldwide and the third most frequent cause of
death due to cancer [1]. Although the majority of cases are
still found in Asia and Africa, recent evidence has shown
that both incidence and mortality rate of HCC are rising in
North America and Europe [2-4]. More than 75% of cases
worldwide and 85% of cases in developing countries have
been attributed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C
virus (HCV), both of which increase the risk of HCC about
20-fold [5-8]. Other well-recognized risk factors for HCC
include advanced age, male gender, heavy alcohol drinking,
aflatoxin exposure, tobacco smoking, cirrhosis, and some
rare monogenic syndromes (for example, hemocromatosis,
alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and porphyria cutanea tarda)
[6-8]. Recent studies [5-8] demonstrated that a family
history of liver cancer increases HCC risk, independent
of HBV/HCV infection status. The combination of family
history of liver cancer and positive HBV/HCV serum
markers is associated with an elevated HCC risk of >70-
fold [8].
In the past decades the association between family his￾tory and cancer survival has been studied in various kinds
of cancers, including colorectal cancer [9,10], gastric can￾cer [11], breast cancer [12], and so on. Most of them dem￾onstrated that a positive family history was associated with
improved survival. Since the effect of a positive family
history of HCC on the survival remains unclear, we
performed the present study to evaluate the effect of fam￾ily history on the clinicopathologic characteristics and
prognosis of patients who received hepatectomy as initial
treatment for HCC in a Chinese population.

Methods
Ethics statement
The research was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center,
and written informed consent was obtained from each
patient involved in the study.
Patients
This is a retrospective study based on prospectively
collected data at our hospital. Data on patients who
underwent hepatectomy as initial treatment for HCC
at the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yat-Sen
University Cancer Canter (Guangzhou, China) from 2000
to 2008 were retrieved from a prospective database.
Only patients who met all of the following criteria were
included: (1) no previous treatment for HCC before
surgery; (2) histologic confirmation of HCC; (3) macro￾scopically completely resected, with a microscopically
tumor-free margin proven by the pathology (R0 resection);
(4) no lymph node or extrahepatic metastasis; (5) no
history of other malignant disease; and (6) completed
an interview about family history and health behavior.
Since the current study aimed to analyze the prognostic
factors for long-term survival, patients who died either
perioperatively <30 days following surgery or during
the original hospital stay if >30 days were excluded
from this study.

All the preoperative parameters was recorded and
evaluated as possible predictors of survivals including
gender, age, HBV status, platelet count (PLT), pro￾thrombin time (PT) alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine
transferase (ALT), total bilirubin level (TBIL), albu￾min (ALB), creatinine (Cr), liver function status,
tumor size and number, and tumor thrombus. Liver
functional reserve was also assessed using Child￾Pugh classification. HBV positive was defined as
HBsAg (+).
Family history assessment
Family history of HCC was ascertained by self￾reporting through an interview at the time of index
case diagnosis. Cases with family history of HCC in a
first-degree relative were recognized as those having
at least one first-degree relative with HCC. First￾degree relatives include parents, siblings, or offspring.
Family history in second-degree relatives was not
assessed in present analysis. No questions were asked
about family size.

Technique of hepatectomy
Hepatectomy was carried out by using the techniques
we described previously [13]. In brief, hepatectomy was
carried out under general anesthesia using a right subcostal
incision with midline extension. Intraoperative ultrasonog￾raphy was routinely performed to confirm resectability
and to visualize major vascular structures. Pringle’s
maneuver was routinely used with a clamp/unclamp
time of 10/5 min. The liver parenchyma was divided
with a clamp-crushing technique or ultrasonic dissector
(CUSA) according to the surgeon’s preference. Ana￾tomic resection was our preferred surgical method in
hepatic resection for multiple nodules in one segment
or in neighboring segments. For anatomic resection, the
hepatic parenchyma was transected at the intersegmental
plane as described by Couinaud. For multiple bilobar
nodules, anatomic resection was preferred for the main
tumor, while satellite nodules were resected non-anatomic￾ally with intent for a negative resection margin. When an
inadequate liver remnant was suspected, non-anatomic re￾section was performed with intent for a negative resection
margin. Hemostasis on the raw liver surface was achieved
with suturing and fibrin glue.
Follow-up
Patients were followed up every 3 months for the first 2
years, then every 6 months thereafter with physical
examination, blood tests for AFP and liver function, and
contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT). Chest
radiography was done every 6 months to detect lung
metastasis. When metastasis was suspected, CT chest,
bone scintigraphy, positron emission tomography (PET),
and biopsy if indicated were also performed to confirm
metastasis and/or recurrence. The last follow-up date
for patients still alive was in October 2012.
Causes of death and sites of recurrence were determined
from death certificates, medical interviews, and radio￾logical findings. Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the interval between surgery and time of either death
or last follow-up. Disease-free survival (DFS) was
defined as the length of time after liver resection for HCC
to detectable intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic recurrence.
The treatment for recurrent tumors was determined by
our multidisciplinary team (MDT) made up of surgeons,
oncologists, radiologists, hepatologists, and pathologists.
Statistical analyses
The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
13.0 statistical software (SPSS Company, Chicago, IL,
USA). The two groups were compared using student’s
t-test for continuous data and the Chi-square test for
categorical data. The OS and DFS were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank
test. The prognostic factors in predicting OS and DFS

were assessed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis. All covariates that affected survival
at the P <0.10 level of significance in univariate analysis
were included in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model. Results were given as mean ± SD. All statistical
tests were two-sided, and a significant difference was
considered when P <0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 1,427 patients with HCC who underwent hep￾atectomy as initial treatment were identified during the
study period. Based on our inclusion criteria, 114 patients
were excluded from this study, consisting of patients with
lymph node metastasis (n = 11), positive resection margins
(n = 77, 5.40%, 77/1,427), and those that died postopera￾tively (n = 26, mortality of 1.82%, 26/1,427).
Patients’ baseline characteristics were summarized in
Table 1. A total number of 1,313 patients were included
in the study, including 169 patients (12.9%, 169/1,313)
had a family history of HCC. The demographic and clin￾icopathologic characteristics of patients with or without
a family history of HCC were compared, and no signifi￾cant difference was identified between these two groups.
Effect of family history on survival
The median follow-up period was 44 months (range 2.5-
73.5 months). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for all patients

were 79.2%, 55.4%, and 45.5%, respectively, and the
median OS was 47 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS
was 52.6%, 36.1%, and 31.8%, respectively, and the median
DFS was 15 months.
Table 2 summarized the OS and DFS of patients with
or without a family history of HCC for all patients and
subgroups according to TNM-7. For either OS or DFS,
there was no significant difference in all patients nor in
subgroups (Table 2, Figure 1).
Since the synergism between HBV and a family history
of HCC was noted by several studies, the OS and DFS of
HBV positive patients with or without a family history of
HCC were compared in Table 3. Similarly, for either OS
or DFS, there was no significant difference in all patients
nor in subgroups (Table 3, Figure 2).
It was also reported that a family history of HCC was
only a risk factor in men but not women. The OS and
DFS of male patients with or without a family history of
HCC were compared in Figure 3. Similarly, there was no
significant difference in either OS or in DFS (P = 0.313
and P = 0.282, respectively, Figure 3).
Prognostic factors
All factors listed in Table 1 were included in univariate
analysis and the covariates that affected survival at the
P <0.10 level of significance in univariate analysis were
included in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model. Multivariate analysis showed that major vascular
invasion (HR 2.624, 95% CI 2.149-3.203, P <0.001), tumor
size (HR 1.670, 95% CI 1.405-1.986, P <0.001), tumor
number (HR 1.569, 95% CI 1.333-1.846, P <0.001), PT
(HR 1.424, 95% CI 1.217-1.666, P <0.001), ALB (HR 1.363,
95% CI 1.005-1.848, P = 0.046), PLT (HR 1.287, 95% CI
1.034-1.602, P = 0.024), and AFP (HR 1.179, 95% CI

1.011-1.375, P = 0.035) were significant prognostic factors
for OS (Table 4).
For DFS, multivariate analysis showed that major vascu￾lar invasion (HR 2.456, 95% CI 2.036-2.962, P <0.001),
tumor number (HR 1.617, 95% CI 1.397-1.872, P <0.001),
tumor size (HR 1.541, 95% CI 1.326-1.789, P <0.001),
micro vascular invasion (HR 1.338, 95% CI 1.082-1.655,
P = 0.007), and PT (HR 1.253, 95% CI 1.092-1.438,
P = 0.001) were significant prognostic factors (Table 4).
Family history was not a significant prognostic factor
for either OS or DFS.
Discussion
Numerous studies [8,14-24] have demonstrated that a
positive family history of liver cancer increases the risk
of developing HCC. However, no previous studies have
examined the influence of family history of liver cancer
on subsequent outcomes in patients with established
cancer. In this study, for the first time, we investigated
the effect of family history on the clinicopathologic char￾acteristics and prognosis of HCC. Our results showed
that there was no significant difference in clinicopatho￾logic characteristics and prognosis for patients with or
without family history of HCC, either in all patients or
in subgroups.
This study is based on family history as reported by
patients, and only cases with a family history of HCC in
first-degree relatives were included and analyzed. In the
Connecticut Family Health Study [25], reports from first￾degree relatives were more accurate than those from
second-degree relatives, with positive predictive values
between 78% and 80% for lung and breast cancer.
Furthermore, several studies [5,8,14,24] have shown
that only the family history of HCC in first-degree rela￾tives increases the risk of developing HCC, but not
second-degree relatives. Thus, we considered only first￾degree relatives and second-degree relatives were not
assessed in this study. We observed that 169 of the 1,313
patients (12.9%) had a family history of HCC in first￾degree relatives. Our results were similar to those pre￾vious epidemiologic studies from Asian, USA, and
European populations. Yu et al. [13] from China dem￾onstrated that 17.5% of 553 patients reported having
first-degree family members with HCC. Hassan et al.
[8] from the USA observed that 6.1% of the 347 pa￾tients with HCC reported having first-degree family
members with liver cancer. In a case-control study in Italy
[24], 37 of 284 HCC patients (13.0%) reported having first￾degree relatives with liver cancer.
Family history of the disease was found to be associated
with improved survival in some kinds of cancers [9-12],
including colon cancer, breast cancer, and so on. However
there was some controversy in regards to gastric cancer.
Han et al. [11] and Palli et al. [26] reported that a positive
family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives was
associated with a decreased risk of death and recurrence
in patients after adjustments for known prognostic factors.
However, a report from Japan [27] found that a family
history negatively affected survival among gastric cancer
patients. In Taiwan [28], the survival curve of patients with
a positive family history was similar to that of patients
without a family history. In our study, the impact of family
history of HCC on both OS and DFS were analyzed in
all patients and in subgroups according to TNM-7 stage.
However, no significant difference was identified in patients
with or without family history of HCC in either OS or DFS,
in all patients or in subgroups.
The synergism between HBV/HCV and a family history
of HCC was noted by several studies [5,8,14,24]. Turati
et al. [24] reported that the combination of family history
of liver cancer and HBV/HCV serum markers is associated
to a >70-fold elevated HCC risk. The prognosis of HBV￾positive patients with or without a family history was com￾pared in our study. Similarly, there was no significant
difference in either OS or DFS, in all patients or in sub￾groups. Only a few patients (9.5%, 16/169) with a family
history were HBV-negative, the survival of HBV-negative
patients with or without a family history cannot be ana￾lyzed in the present study.
Hassan et al. [8] observed that family history of liver
cancer was only a risk factor for HCC in men but not in
women. Similar results were also shown in a prospective
longitudinal 90,000-person cohort study in China [14]
and a case-control study from Italy [15]. But Turati et al.
[24] and two Japanese studies [20,21] observed a non￾significantly stronger association between HCC risk and

family history of liver cancer for men. The OS and DFS of
male patients with or without a family history of HCC
were also compared in current study. However, no signifi￾cant difference was identified either in OS or in DFS.
Several limitations of this study require commenting.
First, as we relied on self-reported family history, mis￾classification of family history status may be possible.
However, prior studies [25,29] have demonstrated such
data to be reliable. Moreover, because the data on family
history were collected at study baseline before treatment,
any errors in recall would have attenuated rather than
exaggerated a true association with patient outcome.
Second, we did not collect information regarding number
of siblings, and the likelihood of having a family history of
the disease may vary according to the number of siblings
at risk for the disease. However, it is unlikely that family
size independently affects survival. Another limitation
is the lack of information on family history of chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other inherited diseases such as
genetic hemochromatosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency, which may be related to HCC risk and prognosis
[30-32]. Third, because our study was based on a database
in a single tertiary cancer center hospital and all patients
received hepatectomy as initial treatment, our results may
not be generalizable to a larger population of patients with
HCC, or patients treated with other methods including
transcather artery chemoembolization, local ablation
therapy, systemic chemotherapy, and so on. However,
the rate of family history in this cohort is similar to
the general population of patients with HCC.
Finally, we cannot completely exclude the possibility
that patients with a family history may experience an
earlier detection of malignancy. However, the effect of
family history persisted after adjusting for other patient
and disease characteristics associated with cancer recur￾rence or survival. Additionally, administration of treatment,
therapies for recurrence disease, and follow-up care were
reasonably uniform among all participants. Moreover, the
association between family history and survival remained
largely unchanged across the TNM stage as well as HBV
status.
Studies suggested the importance of genetic contributions
to the development of HCC. However, the relationship
between family history and outcome is likely to be com￾plex and may be influenced by a confluence of genetic and
environmental factors [33-35]. We considered whether
shared environmental or lifestyle factors might contribute
to our findings. Further investigation to explore the re￾lationship between family history and these factors is
required.
Conclusion
Our results showed that there was no significant differ￾ence in clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis
for patients with HCC after hepatectomy with or with￾out family history of HCC, either in all patients or in
subgroups.
