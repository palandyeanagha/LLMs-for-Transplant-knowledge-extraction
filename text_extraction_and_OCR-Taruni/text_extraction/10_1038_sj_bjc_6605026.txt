The hypoxia-mediated response of tumours is a major determining factor in growth and metastasis. Understanding tumour biology
under hypoxic conditions is crucial for the development of antiangiogenic therapy. Using one of the largest cohorts of rectal
adenocarcinomas to date, this study investigated hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and HIF-2a protein expression in relation to
rectal cancer recurrence and cancer-specific survival. Patients (n ¼ 90) who had undergone surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma, with
no prior neoadjuvant therapy or metastatic disease, and for whom adequate follow-up data were available were selected.
Microvessel density (MVD), HIF-1a and HIF-2a expressions were assessed immunohistologically with the CD34 antibody for vessel
identification and the NB100-131B and NB100-132D3 antibodies for HIF-1a and HIF-2a, respectively. In a multifactorial analysis,
results were correlated with tumour stage, recurrence rate and long-term survival. Microvessel density was higher across T and N
stages (Po0.001) and associated with poor survival (hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 8.7, Po0.005) and decreased disease-free survival
(HR ¼ 4.7, Po0.005). hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and -2a were expressed in 450% of rectal cancers (HIF-1a, 54%, 48/90; HIF-2a,
64%, 58/90). HIF-1a positivity was associated with both TNM stage (Po0.05) and vascular invasion (Po0.005). In contrast, no
associations were shown between HIF-2a expression and any pathological features, and HIF-1a positivity had no effect on outcome.
The study showed an independent association between HIF-1a expression and advanced TNM stage with poor outcome. Our
results indicate that HIF-1a, but not HIF-2a, might be used as a marker of prognosis, in addition to methods currently used, to
enhance patient management.

The UK incidence of colorectal carcinoma is approximately 34 000
of which a third are rectal cancers (Kmietowicz, 2004). In the
United States, colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer
in women and the third commonest in men with over 148 000 new
cases each year (American Cancer Society, 2006). After potentially
curative surgical resection, local recurrence rates of rectal cancer
have been reported from 4 to 32% (Sagar and Pemberton, 1996)
with overall 5 year survival of less than 40% (Lindmark et al, 1994;
Dahlberg et al, 1998).
Hypoxia is one of the key stimuli for the release of angiogenic
factors necessary for angiogenesis and tumour growth. Tumours
outgrow their local blood supply resulting in a hypoxic micro￾environment. Although lesions 1 –2 mm in diameter receive
nutrients by cellular diffusion, an increase in tumour size beyond
this requires rapid adaptation to hypoxia to prevent cessation of
growth and necrosis (Pugh and Ratcliffe, 2003). A component of
this adaptation, increased microvessel density (MVD), has been
shown in polyps and colorectal cancers (Bossi et al, 1995) and
linked to increasing transmural tumour extension (Choi et al,
1998; Rasheed et al, 2009). High colorectal cancer MVD has also
been associated with an increased incidence of haematogenous
metastases and poor prognosis (Tomisaki et al, 1996; Gulubova
and Vlaykova, 2007; Rasheed et al, 2008).
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric basic helix￾loop-helix transcription factor involved in the regulation of
cellular adaptation to hypoxia by upregulating genes directly
responsible for angiogenesis. HIF consists of an a- and b-subunit
(HIF-a and HIF-b/ARNT; Conway et al, 2001), which can be
further subdivided into distinct isoforms, including HIF-1,
HIF-2 and HIF-3. The first two of these exhibit conserved
amino-acid sequences, but different mRNA expression patterns
(Conway et al, 2001; Aprelikova et al, 2004). The HIF-b/ARNT
subunit is constitutively expressed and involved in a number of

non-hypoxia-related processes, whereas the a-subunit is the
hypoxia-regulating component (Carmeliet et al, 1998; Talks et al,
2000). Both HIF-1a and HIF-2a are subject to post-transcriptional
regulation mediated by the von Hippel – Lindau protein (VHL), but
only HIF-1a regulates the induction of the glycolytic enzymes
essential for cell proliferation and survival under hypoxic stress
(Aprelikova et al, 2004). Under physiological normoxic conditions,
HIF-a is propyl hydroxylated after activation of VHL and then
prepared for degradation through mitochondrial ubiquitination.
However, under hypoxic conditions, this degradation cannot take
place due to a reduction in propyl hydroxylation, which leads to
HIF-1a accumulation; levels of HIF-1a correlate with the oxygen
status of the cell (Iyer et al, 1998; Blancher et al, 2000). HIF-a
upregulation causes activation of target genes and expression of
various growth factors, including VEGF, which induce endothelial
cell proliferation and migration resulting in new vessel growth
(Ratcliffe et al, 1997; Talks et al, 2000; Giatromanolaki and Harris,
2001).
Patients with mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene
develop highly vascular tumours, including renal cell carcinomas,
phaeochromocytomas and retinal haemangioblastomas (Semenza,
2001; Wykoff et al, 2001). Hypoxia-inducible factor has been
shown to play a major role in the angiogenesis and growth of
various tumours, including breast (Leek et al, 2002), bladder (Palit
et al, 2005), renal (Klatte et al, 2007), pancreatic (Shibaji et al,
2003) and cervical (Birner et al, 2000) cancers. Indeed, over￾expression of, in particular, HIF-1a, has been correlated with
unfavourable prognosis in a number of malignancies
(Theodoropoulos et al, 2005; Maynard and Ohh, 2007; Trastour
et al, 2007).
In colorectal cancer, Jiang et al (2003a, b) showed that HIF-1a
mRNA was present in a significant number of colorectal adenoma
and carcinoma specimens. They also found an increase in HIF-1a
expression concordant with more advanced Dukes’ stage. Kuwai
et al (2003) associated HIF-1a expression with tumour invasion,
venous invasion, liver metastasis and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) expression. Similarly, Lu et al (2006) found a strong
association between HIF-1a expression, high VEGF expression,
nodal metastasis and Dukes’ stage in rectal cancer and, in contrast
to Kuwai et al (2003) showed an overall reduction in survival in
patients with high HIF-1a expression. These findings were
supported by an investigation in patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer where an association was shown between HIF-1a
expression, lymph node metastasis and poor outcome. Antiangio￾genic drugs have been shown to be effective both experimentally
and in clinical trials in various malignancies, including colorectal
cancer. The monoclonal IgG1 antibody, Bevacizumab (Avastin),
which binds VEGF preventing receptor binding, has been
evaluated in the first- and second-line treatment in patients with
colorectal cancer (Willett et al, 2004, 2006; Chua and Cunningham,
2006; Rasheed et al, 2008). Interestingly, novel antiangiogenic
compounds have been developed that decrease HIF-1a and other
HIFs (Mackay et al, 2005; Zhu et al, 2007; Singh et al, 2008).
We are evaluating whether detection of hypoxic factor expres￾sion in rectal cancer can be used to identify patient subgroups at
increased risk of recurrences and poorer outcome. Recognising
positive factor expression will identify patients most likely to
benefit from specific antiangiogenic therapies, including HIF
inhibitors. In this study, we investigate one of the largest cohorts
of patients to date with rectal adenocarcinoma across all stages for
HIF-1a and HIF-2a expressions and have appraised associations
between expression and a number of clinicopathological variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma operated on between 1991
and 1997 at St Mark’s Hospital were selected for this study
provided they had curable, local disease before surgery. Those with
metastatic disease and/or had received neoadjuvant chemo￾radiotherapy were excluded. Complete follow-up data and
sufficient paraffin-embedded tissue to stain with antibodies for
HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CD34 (for MVD) were available in 90 cases.
Normal proximal adjacent bowel obtained from 25 randomly
selected patients was used as internal control tissue.
Tissue sections (4 mm) of archival paraffin-embedded block
specimens were mounted onto slides. The antibodies used were for
identification of CD34 blood vessels (Novus Biologicals, LLC,
Littleton, CO, USA, QBend10, dilution 1 : 100, no pre-treatment),
HIF-1a (NB 100-131B, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1 : 500, pressure
cooked for 2 min at full pressure, pre-treated with citrate buffer,
pH 6.0) and HIF-2a (NB100-132D3, Novus Biologicals, dilution
1 : 100, pressure cooked for 2 min at full pressure, pre-treated with
citrate buffer, pH 6.0; Talks et al, 2000; Koukourakis et al, 2002;
Leek et al, 2002). Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in a
DAKO Immuno Autostainer Plus (Glostrup, Denmark) with
‘Chemmate Envision’ after standard dewaxing with xylene and
ethanol and pre-treatment. Microvessel density was assessed by
counting vessels per power field (23-mm eye piece width) at  200
magnification following identification of the three most
vessel-dense ‘hotspots’ at  40 magnification (Figures 1 and 2;

rectal adenocarcinoma showing high vessel density (  200).

Bossi et al, 1995). Vessels were counted in the three most vessel￾dense areas within the central part of the tumour and at the
invasive tumour front. A mean score of all areas was calculated.
The mean value of 60 vessels per high power field was used as the
cutsoff between high and low MVDs.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and -2a (nuclear and cytoplasmic)
stainings (Figures 3 –5) were reviewed by two experienced
assessors (SR and TG) in terms of percentage of positive tumour
cells. The predominant site of distribution, for example, intra￾tumoral, invasive edge of tumour was noted. The following
clinicopathological factors were analysed: age at the time of
surgery; gender; surgical procedure categorised as abdomino￾perineal excision of rectum or anterior resection of rectum;
tumour grading; staging according to the Dukes’ and tumour node
metastasis (TNM) classifications; venous invasion (intramural and
extramural); perineural invasion, number of regional lymph nodes
and number of involved lymph nodes.
Data sources and study approval
The study was approved by the North West London Hospitals’
Research and Development Committee and the Harrow Research
and Ethics Committee.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS for Windows
version 14 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The Fisher’s exact test or
Yates continuity corrected w2
-test was used for testing relation￾ships between categorical variables where appropriate. Kaplan –
Meier survival curves were constructed, and the log-rank test was
used to determine statistical differences between the groups. A Cox
proportional hazard model was used to assess the effects of patient
and tumour variables on survival with Po0.05 taken as significant.
Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to assess the independent
relationship of variables with cancer-specific and disease-free
survivals.
RESULTS
Patients and clinicopathogical characteristics
A total of 90 patients comprising 56 males (62%), 34 females (38%)
were studied with a mean age of 59 (standard deviation, s.d.±12)
years and a median follow-up of 78 months (range: 2 –228
months). There was no significant difference between male and
female patients in terms of mean age or follow-up. Clinicopatho￾logical characteristics are described in Table 1.
Microvessel density differs between tumour and normal
tissue, across T and N stages and is associated with poor
survival
For the cases (n ¼ 90), the mean MVD was 63 vessels per high￾power field (HPF; s.d.±20) and for controls (n ¼ 23), the MVD
was 22 vessels per HPF. The MVD was significantly higher in
tumour versus non-neoplastic mucosa (63 vs 22; Po0.01, Fisher’s
exact) and across the various T stages: T1 ¼ 44 (s.d.±3); T2 ¼ 45
(s.d.±13); T3 ¼ 67 (s.d.±21) and T4 ¼ 68 (s.d.±9; post hoc,
ANOVA, Po0.001); and N stages: N0 ¼ 56 (s.d.±16), N1 ¼ 74
(s.d.±17), N2 ¼ 76 (s.d.±26; post hoc, ANOVA, Po0.001).
Survival analysis showed a significant difference in cancer-specific

MVD of 60 vessels per HPF (Figure 6A; log-rank test w2 ¼ 12.5,
d.f. ¼ 1 (degree of freedom); HR ¼ 8.7, 95% confidence interval
(CI:) 2.0 –37.3, Po0.005) and disease-free survival (Figure 6B; log￾rank test w2 ¼ 11.1, d.f. ¼ 1, HR ¼ 4.7, 95% CI: 1.6 –13.7, Po0.005).
HIF-1a but not HIF-2a protein expression is associated
with advanced pathological features and poor survival
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and -2a stains were present within the
epithelial and stromal compartments in over half of rectal cancers
(54%, 48/90 and 64%, 58/90, respectively). In contrast, HIF-1a
stain was only present in a small fraction of control sections
(8%, 2/25; HIF-1a staining in cases vs controls, Po0.005) and HIF￾2a stain was not seen in any of the control sections. The following
features were observed to be associated with HIF-1a positivity
(Table 2): lymph node stage (Po0.02); TNM stage (Po0.05); and
vascular invasion (Po0.005).
The association between Dukes’ stage and HIF-1a positivity
almost reached statistical significance (P ¼ 0.05), although com￾bining Dukes’ A and B cancers together and C1 with C2 cancers
resulted in a statistically significant difference in HIF-1a positivity
between Dukes’ A/B and C (Dukes’ A/B, 44% positive vs 56%
negative; Dukes’ C, 70% positive vs 30% negative; Po0.02). In
contrast to results for HIF-1a, there were no observed associations
between HIF-2a positivity and any of the pathological features
under investigation (Table 3). Cox regression univariate analysis
revealed a significant effect of HIF-1a positivity on cancer-specific
survival (Figure 7A; log-rank test w2 ¼ 12.2, d.f. ¼ 1, HR ¼ 5.47 95%
CI: 1.96 –16.03, Po0.002) and disease-free survival (Figure 7B; log￾rank test w2 ¼ 10.85, d.f. ¼ 1, HR ¼ 4.47, 95% CI: 1.68 –11.89,
P ¼ 0.003). On multivariate analysis, HIF-1a positivity retained a
significant effect on cancer-specific survival independent of TNM
stage and vascular invasion (HR ¼ 4.11, 95% CI ¼ 1.37 –12.35,
P ¼ 0.012; Table 4). Again, in direct contrast, there was no effect
of HIF-2a positivity on cancer-specific survival (log-rank test
w2 ¼ 2.275, d.f. ¼ 1, HR ¼ 0.545, 95% CI: 0.244 –1.217, P ¼ 0.139;
Figure 8A), although, contrary to HIF-1a, a trend towards
decreased recurrence (log-rank test w2 ¼ 2.51, d.f. ¼ 1,
HR ¼ 0.542, 95% CI ¼ 0.25 –1.17, P ¼ 0.12) was observed for HIF￾2a positivity (Figure 8B).

Our study comprises one of the largest groups of rectal cancer
cases across all stages and we have determined that both HIF-1a

and HIF-2a were widely expressed in rectal cancer compared with
normal large bowel mucosa (controls). Over half of all cases
showed HIF-1a expression (54%) and nearly two-thirds were
found to have positive HIF-2a expression (64%). As discussed
earlier by Talks et al (2000), as HIF-a-subunits are affected by
cellular oxygenation, it is uncertain as to whether the findings in
paraffin-embedded-fixed tissue accurately reflect cellular status
in vivo. However, our observed findings do show clear differences
between the two groups and, as cases and controls have been
processed in a consistent manner, this does represent a genuine
finding of increased hypoxic factor expression in rectal cancer
cases when compared with normal rectal tissue.
We have shown an association between increasing depth of
tumour invasion and MVD and have shown a relationship between
increased MVD and poor prognosis, a finding consistent with
earlier studies investigating colorectal cancers (Tomisaki et al,
1996; Choi et al, 1998). In a large series of 97 rectal cancer-specific
patients, Chen et al (2004) reported that cases with a higher MVD
were more likely to develop tumour recurrence or metastasis.
Tomisaki et al (1996), in assessing an association correlation
between MVD and liver metastasis, found a mean MVD of 64 in
colorectal cancer patients with hepatic metastasis compared with a
mean MVD of 52 in patients without metastasis (P ¼ 0.001). In
addition, the relationship in colorectal cancer between MVD and
prognosis has also been described in most studies indicating a
positive correlation between high MVD and poor outcome
(Vermeulen et al, 1999; Li et al, 2003). We have shown a direct
relationship between increasing MVD and cancer-specific survival.
In our study, an MVD of above the cutoff of 60 microvessels per
HPF was a clear determinant of poor outcome. As such, we would
propose that high MVD (above 60 HPF) can be used as a factor to
determine surveillance and adjuvant therapy. As yet, to our
knowledge, the effect of specific chemotherapeutic or antiangio￾genic agents has not been assessed in a randomised controlled trial
with groups determined by MVD.
Our data show an association between HIF-1a expression and
TNM stage, nodal stage, vascular invasion and Dukes’ stage, on
subdivision between node-positive and -negative cases, suggesting
a direct role for HIF-1a in disease progression. Interestingly, we
found no association between HIF-1a and MVD in our study, and
either more numbers may be needed to show an association or it
may suggest an alternative mechanism of action for this hypoxic￾inducible factor. We have also shown a strong correlation between
HIF-1a expression and cancer-specific mortality and tumour
recurrence suggesting that this factor is an integral component
of rectal cancer growth. Perhaps HIF is regulated by oncogenes in
addition to acting through the pathway regulated by hypoxia. For
example, interactions of HIF1 with b-catenin in colon cancer cell
lines have been reported (Kaidi et al, 2007). Also, it is possible that
as both mature and immature vessels are being assessed, this may
reflect effects of other growth factors and vascular differentiation.
Curiously, although HIF-2a is considered to act as an oncogene,
we did not find any association between the various pathological
factors studied and protein expression of this gene, nor did we find
an association between HIF-2a expression and cancer-specific
survival or recurrence. We did not show a relationship between
HIF-2a and MVD, which is also surprising. There did appear to be
a trend towards a reduction in tumour recurrence with HIF-2a

expression, although this did not reach statistical significance.
Both Jiang et al (2003b), in colorectal cancer, and Lu et al (2006),
in rectal cancer, showed increased positivity for HIF-1a expression
with increasing Dukes’ stage. The latter group also found an
overall reduction in survival in patients with high HIF-1a
expression. Theodoropoulos et al (2006) showed a significant
association between HIF-1a and lymph node metastasis, low rectal
location and advanced tumour grade. Although HIF-1a expression,
infiltrative tumour growth pattern, positive lymph node status and
VEGF upregulation were associated with decreased disease-free
and overall survival, multivariate analysis only revealed high
HIF-1a reactivity and lymph node positivity as predictors of poor
outcome. This is the more notable of the earlier rectal cancer
studies due to the higher numbers, and it is interesting to note the
similarities in terms of percentage of expression in these studies to
our own.
It is quite likely that numerous factors act separately to
cause tumour growth and spread, and pathways may interact in
an as yet undefined manner. A number of these factors have
been described to be hypoxia and non-hypoxia dependent,
including VHL, COX-2, CA-9, CHOP and ATF4, among many
others (Yoshimura et al, 2004; Kivela et al, 2005; Carracedo et al,
2006; Cleven et al, 2007).
