Abstract
Background
There is a need to understand the impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer care globally
and determine drivers of variation.
Objective
To evaluate COVID-19 impact on colorectal cancer services globally and identify predictors
for behaviour change.
Design
An online survey of colorectal cancer service change globally in May and June 2020.
Participants
Attending or consultant surgeons involved in the care of patients with colorectal cancer.
Main outcome measures
Changes in the delivery of diagnostics (diagnostic endoscopy), imaging for staging, thera￾peutics and surgical technique in the management of colorectal cancer. Predictors of
change included increased hospital bed stress, critical care bed stress, mortality and world
region.
Results
191 responses were included from surgeons in 159 centers across 46 countries, demon￾strating widespread service reduction with global variation. Diagnostic endoscopy was
reduced in 93% of responses, even with low hospital stress and mortality; whilst rising

critical care bed stress triggered complete cessation (p = 0.02). Availability of CT and MRI
fell by 40–41%, with MRI significantly reduced with high hospital stress. Neoadjuvant ther￾apy use in rectal cancer changed in 48% of responses, where centers which had ceased
surgery increased its use (62 vs 30%, p = 0.04) as did those with extended delays to surgery
(p<0.001). High hospital and critical care bed stresses were associated with surgeons form￾ing more stomas (p<0.04), using more experienced operators (p<0.003) and decreased lap￾aroscopy use (critical care bed stress only, p<0.001). Patients were also more actively
prioritized for resection, with increased importance of co-morbidities and ICU need.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with severe restrictions in the availability of colo￾rectal cancer services on a global scale, with significant variation in behaviours which cannot
be fully accounted for by hospital burden or mortality.
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct impact on global health, requiring the re-allocation
and rationing of scarce resources at an unprecedented scale [1]. However, this drastic re-pur￾posing is likely to have substantial indirect effects on the delivery of non-COVID-19 care. This
is of critical importance for cancer patients, where delays to diagnosis and treatment have long
term repercussions at both an individual patient and national level [2, 3]. This has been
recently modelled, predicting excess deaths over the pandemic’s first year of over 6000 in
England and over 33,000 in the USA [4]. In the UK, it has been reported that cancer screening
has been cancelled, urgent cancer referrals from the community have fallen by an average of
76% and that face-to-face outpatient appointments have been largely abandoned [4, 5]; with
similar changes expected worldwide. Colorectal cancer is the third commonest cause of cancer
related death globally [6], with its complex diagnostic pathways and multimodal treatment vul￾nerable to disruption by COVID-19 at every stage of the patient pathway. The availability of
diagnostic colonoscopy and CT colonography have been severely curtailed, based on multiple
international recommendations [7–9]. Similarly, resectional surgery has been cancelled in
many centers due to the requirement for space (hospital beds), equipment (ventilators) as well
as the redeployment of staff [2].
The speed at which the pandemic evolved was not anticipated in several countries and left
little time for the generation of national or international guidance. A clearer understanding of
precisely how colorectal practice has changed during the pandemic is now urgently needed, to
elucidate the driving factors of change and to effectively plan for the recovery. Furthermore,
many countries are anticipating a second wave of infections and services must be able to flexi￾bly scale to maintain cancer services.
We hypothesized significant variation in the organisational responses of colorectal centers
globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this snapshot survey of colorectal practice, we
collected survey data to determine the local impact on colorectal cancer diagnostic and thera￾peutic domains.
Materials and methods
This study was a global cross-sectional survey of the change in elective colorectal practice
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Survey design and data collection
A survey was designed through consultation of a core committee of surgeons experienced in
qualitative research methodology. Questions were a combination of multiple choice and
forced-ranking scales (S1 File). The questions were designed to cover demographic informa￾tion of each respondent and center, with exploration of how diagnostic and therapeutic
resources, treatment strategies and personnel allocation had been affected by the pandemic.
This survey was administered using Google Forms (Google LLC, USA) and invites were dis￾tributed to international colleagues, through governing bodies such as the Royal College of
Surgeons of England and through the PanSurg social medial channels; from 2nd April 2020.
Consultant or attending surgeons performing elective resections for colorectal cancer were eli￾gible for inclusion. National mortality was defined as the mortality from COVID-19 for each
country on the day the survey was received [10], reported as deaths/million.
Definitions of metrics used
COVID-19 Load was defined as the number of COVID-19 patients currently admitted to the
respondent’s center and was categorised as low (0–20), medium (21–100) and high (>100
patients). Total hospital bed capacity was stratified as low (0–500), medium (501–1000) and high
(>1000 beds); with critical care capacity also described as low (0–20), medium (21–100) and
high (>100 beds). By comparing the COVID-19 Load to the hospital and critical care bed capac￾ity in of each respondents’ center, we derived the metrics Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care
Bed Stress. Stress was low when the strata of capacity exceeded the COVID-19 Load, medium
when the strata of COVID-19 Load equaled that of bed capacity and high when the strata of
COVID-19 Load exceeded that of capacity. For large hospitals where the COVID burden was
also high, stress was determined to be high if the total patient burden was greater than 200.
Surgeons were asked to rank six factors for importance when prioritizing a patient for colo￾rectal resection. A pairwise comparison was made of the ordinal perceived importance
between each factor within a response and then aggregated across the dataset. The Priority
Score was defined for each factor as the sum of the scores against the other 5 factors, where a
higher score reflects the surgeon valuing it with greater general importance and the converse
true of negative scores. The absolute value relates to the strength of preference.
To interpret deviation from usual practice across 11 domains (endoscopy, computed
tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography
(PET), therapeutic endoscopy, rectal neoadjuvant therapy, colon neoadjuvant therapy, delays
to surgery, operators, laparoscopy, stoma formation) we defined a Change Score. For each
domain 1 point was given if a respondent’s center had limited availability and 2 were given if it
was unavailable.
Statistical analysis
Data were processed and analysed in R Studio v1.1.453 using the ‘tidyverse’ package [11, 12].
Categorical variables were analysed using Chi-squared or Fisher’s Exact test based on expected
cell values. Continuous data were analysed using ANOVA or Mann Whitney U test for
parametric and non-parametric data respectively. Statistical significance was defined using α =
0.05.
Results
198 survey responses were received until 17th May 2020, with 7 excluded from analysis due to
insufficient data (n = 6) or respondent not being a consultant or attending surgeon (n = 1).

This left 191 replies for inclusion, from 159 distinct centers across 46 countries. The demo￾graphics and characteristics of the included surgeons and centers are presented in Table 1.
COVID-19 burden and stress on hospital resources
162 of the respondents (85%) described the presence of patients suffering with COVID-19 in
their center, with a relative balance across low, medium and high burdens. The matrices com￾paring COVID Load with hospital and critical care bed capacities are demonstrated in Fig 1,
defining the metrics Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed Stress. These metrics were vali￾dated by comparing the strata to national mortality, demonstrating significant association (p =
<0.001, Fig 2). Global variation in COVID Load, Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed
Stress is presented in Table 2.
Impact of system stress on diagnosis and therapeutics
COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on the capability of centers to provide diagnostic and
therapeutic services for colorectal cancer (Table 3), with significant variation in the extent of
change across available modalities and how this correlates to the stress of the healthcare
center.

This is most notable when examining the availability of diagnostic endoscopy, which is
operating at normal levels in only 7% of responses. Having no diagnostic endoscopy rather
than a limited one was associated with high Critical Care Bed Stress (p = 0.02) and national
mortality (p < 0.001), however, not with Hospital Bed Stress (p = 0.24). There are slight dif￾ferences for therapeutic endoscopy. Of the 176 respondents that used it prior to the pan￾demic, there was greater success in maintaining a normal service (23%), however, there is
again evidence that many centers were limiting it despite low stress. The hospital and criti￾cal care bed stress metrics appear unable to account for why some units were ceasing this
service entirely. CT, MRI and PET showed a 40–49% reduction, with the impact on both
MRI and PET scanning appearing to be correlated with Critical Care Bed Stress and Hospital
Bed Stress.
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted significant changes in the use of neoadjuvant
oncologic treatments, with 48% of centers applying these differently for rectal and 23% for
colon cancer. If practice has changed, it is more likely to be an increase in use for rectal cancer
Fig 1. Low, moderate and high Hospital Bed Stress (A) and Critical Care Bed Stress (B), derived from the COVID-19 Load compared to the hospital and critical care bed
capacities respectively. Centers with low hospital or critical care bed capacity and no COVID patients were determined to have a low stress, whereas similarly sized
centers caring for <20 patients deemed at moderate stress. Centers with high hospital or critical care bed capacity and greater than 200 COVID patients were
determined to have a high stress, whereas similarly sized centers caring for <200 patients deemed at moderate stress.

with no clear preference in colon cancer. Which change is made does not correlate with the
country or hospital stress. There appears to be specific associations with an increased use of
neoadjuvant therapies rather than a decrease or no change. Centers that have stopped resec￾tional surgery entirely are significantly more likely to increase use of neoadjuvant therapy in
rectal cancer (62 vs 30%, p = 0.04) but not colon cancer (31 vs 11%, p = 0.11). In centers where
resectional surgery is continuing, greater use of neoadjuvant therapies is associated with
expecting an extended delay to surgery for rectal cancers (p = 0.001).
The impact of COVID-19 on the operative approach, strategy and personnel for elective
colorectal cancer is marked. 7% of centers have ceased elective resections entirely. Of those
continuing to operate, there is an increased use of attending surgeons as the principle and
assisting surgeon, strongly associated with high Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed
Stress. There is no standardised approach for preoperative patient screening with centers
using PCR (33%), imaging (most commonly CT chest, 15%), both PCR and imaging (17%),
risk survey (4%), clinical assessment (3%), both clinical and risk survey (2%) and a combi￾nation of serology, imaging and PCR (2%). No screening is performed in 24% of responses
and there is no clear association with geographical region. There has been a dramatic reduc￾tion in the use of laparoscopy (48%), with reducing or ceasing laparoscopy strongly associ￾ated with Critical Care Bed Stress (p = <0.001), but not to country, national mortality
(p = 0.09) or Hospital Bed Stress (p = 0.14). Of those using laparoscopy, 77% are deploying
smoke extraction devices. 54% of centers have increased their stoma formation rate, largely
within the context of left-sided resections (more likely to perform a Hartmann’s procedure
or to defunction a primary anastomosis). Increased stoma formation was significantly
associated with increased national mortality (p = 0.02) and both metrics of hospital stress
(p = <0.04).
Change Score
The Change Score across 11 domains (endoscopy, CT, MRI, PET, therapeutic endoscopy, rectal
neoadjuvant therapy, colon neoadjuvant therapy, delays to surgery, operators, laparoscopy,
stoma formation) demonstrates that on average, 7 aspects of patient care have changed, with
degree of change significantly increasing as Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed Stress
increase (p = 0.007 and <0.001 respectively, Fig 3).
Prioritisation of patients when scheduling for theatre
Of the 93% of responses where elective operating had not ceased, 64% were implementing new
strategies when prioritizing patients for resection, with guidance generated at a local (62%) or
national level (38%). The Priority Score for the six ranked variables could be calculated across

Surgeons were prioritizing patients for surgery differently based on the Hospital Bed Stress.
As it increases, co-morbidities became relatively more important, with extended delay follow￾ing neoadjuvant therapy and expected case difficulty becoming less important (Fig 4A). This
was such that for High Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed Stress, age surpassed extended
delay in priority; findings unique to this stratum. The findings for Critical Care Bed Stress were
generally similar to Hospital Bed Stress, however, as burden increases there is slightly greater
relative importance placed on the need for an ICU bed postoperatively (Fig 4B). The difference

under pressure, surgeons place a higher importance on these variables.
Discussion
This is a cross-sectional survey of the global change in elective colorectal cancer practice as a
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating 191 responses from 46 countries. The
primary finding was that whilst practice change has been widespread, there is considerable var￾iation in the response between centers. This can sometimes be understood within the context
of system burden (Hospital Bed Stress, Critical Care Bed Stress), national burden (mortality);
however, in many cases triggers for change cannot be directly identified.
The vast majority of centers globally have had to limit the care they provide across diagnos￾tic endoscopy, imaging for staging, neoadjuvant treatments and definitive surgery. The Critical
Care Bed Stress metric appears to be one of the best predictors of change, likely due to these
facilities experiencing the greatest demand during the pandemic. This would prompt the real￾location of resources from other services in the hospital—endoscopy units, theatres, and recov￾ery areas are all likely to be designated as contingency zones for additional capacity; with
doctors and nurses of other specialties redeployed here. However, there were many examples
of centers limiting their cancer care despite having low stress and mortality. Diagnostic endos￾copy is an excellent example of this. It appears that the initial response to COVID-19 was to
limit services even when hospital pressure is low, with rising Critical Care Bed Stress or
national mortality the triggers to cease services entirely. Concern over diagnostic endoscopy
being an aerosol generating procedure was unlikely to be solely responsible for low-stress cen￾ters limiting their service, as these centers were no more likely to reduce laparoscopy use or to
deploy filtered smoke extractors. Conversely, there were centers experiencing high stresses
who were able to provide care without excessive limitation. Understanding and predicting this
variance is challenging and given that it does not seem correlated to the country (and therefore
the guidance from relevant governing bodies), it is possible that there are local coping mecha￾nisms employed at certain centers which will need to be identified in future research.

Guidance issued from regulatory bodies frequently lacked the clarity demanded by clinicians,
could become outdated in weeks and often conflicted with the guidance of other bodies. Con￾sidering the disparity in COVID-19 impact worldwide, future guidelines will require marked
flexibility to allow effective application in individual centers.
Behaviour changes in surgical strategy and technique demonstrate high correlation with
increased Hospital Bed Stress and Critical Care Bed Stress, with changes designed to reduce risk
to both patients and operating room staff. Whilst there has been no clear evidence that laparos￾copy causes aerosolisation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this is the case with other viruses and
SARS-CoV-2 has been found in peritoneal fluid [13, 14]. This concern has caused conflicting
advice from regulatory bodies, with an intercollegiate paper including the Royal College of
Surgeons recommending a general stop to laparoscopy with other bodies recommending lapa￾roscopy continuing with additional safeguards such as smoke filtration [15–17]. Surgeons
have taken the cautious approach by limiting or ceasing laparoscopy by almost half, particu￾larly with higher mortality; but there is still inadequate appetite for risk mitigation given only
77% use smoke filtration. Preoperative COVID-19 screening is universally recommended but
still not standard of care in many centers [18–21]. The use of stomas was not driven by inter￾national guidance and appears subject to individual surgeon preference. Defunctioning left￾sided anastomoses and/or having a greater propensity to perform a Hartmann’s procedure is
likely to decrease the initial use of hospital resources and protect patient safety in the short￾term (by avoiding the risk and severity of anastomotic leakage). As services are restarted,
stoma reversal may struggle to compete for theatre space increasing the risk of stoma forma￾tion being permanent.
The variation in the application of neoadjuvant therapies for colorectal cancers is marked.
The fact that whether it an increase or decrease was made did not correlate with the country,
mortality or hospital stress implies it is driven by local practice from clinicians present at the
multidisciplinary meetings. The concern with such a cause of variation is that it is less likely to
be evidence-based and the lack of consensus suggests wider guidance is not being applied. The
greater propensity to change in rectal rather than colon cancer may be that the evidence base
is stronger in this cohort and centers have more experience in its use. There was a strong indi￾cation that in centers with extended delays to surgery or without resection happening, neoad￾juvant therapies were increasingly used. This provides oncologic therapy to slow progression
or cause down-staging [22]. The use of chemoradiation in rectal cancer can cause complete
clinical response in 7–27% of cases [23], with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer
appearing to improve oncological outcomes [24]. The concern is that the patients upon which
these studies focus had advanced cancers and it is unclear if the same benefits apply to earlier
stages. Furthermore, unlike more aggressive cancers such as of the esophagus and pancreas;
the relationship between treatment delay and disease progression is much less clear in colorec￾tal, with studies offering different perspectives between harmful delays in addition to the dif￾ference between colon and rectal cancers [25–27]. The optimal time between neoadjuvant
therapy and operative intervention is also unclear, with some evidence that delay beyond 6–8
weeks could be beneficial, however, the point at which extended delay becomes harmful has
not been defined [28]. Whilst hospital visits for chemoradiation and the resultant immunosup￾pression increase a patient’s risk from COVID-19, the balance between oncologic benefit and
COVID-19 risk is not clear and evidence is currently lacking. Centers should be flexible and
dynamic as new guidance and evidence becomes available [29]. Data on long-term oncological
outcomes following COVID-19 is eagerly awaited and will be necessary to guide strategies if
this pandemic is prolonged or when a similar threat arises in the future.
As the burden from COVID-19 increases, surgeons change their approach to prioritising
patients for theatre, likely as a necessity to identify which patients would benefit most when

access is limited. Co-morbidities appear to be of the highest importance. High Critical Care
Bed Stress was associated with increased importance of needing an ICU bed postoperatively
with age increasingly considered given the disproportionate mortality as age increases. Risk
prediction tools such as the American College of Surgeons calculator would better support
decision-making if the impact of COVID-19 was incorporated [30].
Although the key findings of this study are variance in behaviours and practice due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, it may be that these could be better predicted by factors not collected by
the survey, for example, patient choice regarding treatment strategies. There is a risk of selec￾tion biases caused by the survey being in English and that the distribution was likely to favour
Europe and high-income countries. It was not possible to make extensive comparisons by
country or region given that COVID-19 has disproportionally impacted different world areas
and therefore variation is not sufficient for meaningful comparisons on the smaller scale.
Whilst this may not reveal nuanced behaviours within world regions, by taking a global per￾spective, this work has been successful in making predictions of variation whilst considering
confounding factors such as national mortality. The self-reporting of outcomes risks response
bias, where response inaccuracies may be caused by individual personality, psychology or data
availability. The findings here do compare current practice to baseline however the degree of
change is cross-sectional and therefore trends over time cannot be explored. To address this,
the survey will continue to collect responses at: http://tiny.cc/4tkbpz.
This work has implications for research and clinical practice, both within colorectal surgery
and for wider service management during emergency scenarios. In future versions of the sur￾vey, questions will need to assess the evolving use of healthcare networks, either between pub￾lic-public or public-private partnerships; where centers have been increasingly cooperating to
support each other and provide contingency capacity. If there is a second pandemic wave, this
project has highlighted that it is possible to protect many vital elective colorectal services even
when the COVID burden is high, which will be crucial to reducing non-COVID deaths. The
change in oncologic practice which was identified, particularly the different use of neoadjuvant
therapies, provides a unique opportunity to study cancer outcomes with these different treat￾ment strategies. Studies will be required to determine if these new approaches may have
improved patient outcome (whether oncologic or quality of life), informing whether prospec￾tive interventional trials should be conducted.
Conclusion
This study gives new insight into elective colorectal cancer practice on a global scale, with wide
geographical coverage and a range of COVID-19 burdens. Whilst there is evidence of widespread
limitation of services, there is significant variation in behaviours which hospital burden and
national mortality cannot fully account for. The colorectal cancer clinical community requires best
practice to be defined based on consensus and emerging evidence, with improved information
transfer and learning between centers; especially from those better coping with this pandemic.
