Abstract
Background: Heart failure (HF) is associated with impaired maximal aerobic capacity as 
indicated by decreases in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2). Considering that aging by itself has 
a negative effect on this variable, the evaluation of maximum capacity is often questioned because 
current predicted peak VO2 is based on subjects without heart disease or b-blocker therapy. In 
contrast, if decline in predicted and attained peak VO2 were age-related, proportionally, loss of 
aerobic function (predicted peak VO2, %) would remain stable over time in these patients. The 
purpose of this investigation is to assess the effects of age on peak VO2 in HF patients taking 
b-blockers.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 483 (132 female) patients (aged 20–88 years, LVEF 
31 ± 11%) with non-ischemic (n = 362), ischemic (n = 74) and Chagas-related HF (n = 47) 
who had been submitted to an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a motorized 
treadmill. Linear regression was used to develop the equation to predict peak VO2, based on age.
Results: Peak VO2 decreased 0.9 mL/min/kg per age-decade, maximum HR also decreased 
with aging and VE/VCO2 slope was similar among all decades. The predicted new b-blocker 
equation to peak VO2bb was 20.934 – 0.092 × age.
Conclusions: Clinical interpretation of aerobic capacity impairment is influenced by aging 
in HF patients. This evidence must be considered when using peak VO2 for prognostic strati￾fication and clinical decision-making in patients with HF under b-blocker therapy. (Cardiol J

Introduction
Chronic heart failure (HF) is an increasingly 
common disorder in population, which causes high 
mortality and morbidity, despite modern deve￾lopments in medical therapy [1–4]. The primary 
symptoms of chronic HF are exertional fatigue and 
dyspnea due to a reduction in exercise tolerance 
[1]. Additional traits, as age, gender, weight, body 
surface area and muscle mass, can also be correla￾ted to functional capacity in patients with HF [5, 6].
Indeed, performing the cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing (CPX) became increasingly im￾portant in order to provide objective and reprodu￾cible measurement of exercise limitation [1] and 
to identify individuals suffering from HF with poor 
prognosis [1, 6]. Among exercise variables, the 
strongest and most consistent predictors of death 
are peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) [1, 4, 
6], VO2 at the ventilatory threshold, percentage 
of age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR) and 
VE/VCO2 slope [6, 7].
These data have also influence on the chosen 
treatment. In the early 90’s, it was shown that 
patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction 
and peak VO2 < 14 mL/min/kg would benefit 
from cardiac transplantation [1, 8]. More recently, 
a lower cutoff for peak VO2 (< 12.5 mL/min/kg) has 
been identified as predictor of mortality in patients 
with HF, taking b-blocker agents [9].
Nevertheless, a progressive decline in car￾diovascular system occurs with advancing age 
[10]. Age itself is an independent morbidity and 
mortality risk factor for a long list of diseases, 
hospitalization and length of hospitalization [11]. 
Physiological changes that occur during the aging 
process regarding quality of life and functional 
independence are muscle intrinsic abnormalities, 
low muscle mass or muscle perfusion [3], declining 
in muscle strength and in aerobic capacity, indexed 
as peak VO2 [5, 12, 13].
A few studies demonstrated that longitudinal 
rate of declining in peak VO2 is on average 8% to 
10% per decade in the general population and, at 
the age of 60, it is approximately two-thirds of that 
at 20 [10, 14]. Recently it has been reported that 
peak VO2 decreases with age in HF patients, how￾ever, these reports came from studies with patients 
classified as young, middle-aged and older, and the 
peak VO2 was assessed using either a treadmill or 
cycle ergometer CPX [15, 16]. On the other hand, 
there are no trials showing the effect of age by 
decade on peak VO2 in HF patients. It is possible 
that age can influence the peak VO2, as well as the 
cutoff point for cardiac transplant in patients suf￾fering from HF. The purpose of this investigation 
is to assess the effects of age on peak VO2 in HF 
patients taking b-blockers.
Methods
Population and study design
A retrospective analysis was performed in 
consecutive patients with systolic HF referred to 
heart transplant, from 1999 to 2009. Inclusion cri￾teria included clinical and pharmacological stability 
for at least 3 months prior CPX, age ≥ 20 years, 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45%, 
New York Heart Association functional class I–III 
and no participation in regular physical activity 
(≥ 30 min 3 times a week). Patients with cardiac 
device system (pacemaker or implantable defibril￾lator), CPX interrupted due to hemodynamic or 
electrocardiographic complications, respiratory 
exchange ratio (RER) < 1.0, neuromuscular or re￾spiratory limitations were excluded from the study.
A total of 655 clinically and pharmacologically 
stable HF patients underwent CPX during this 
period. One hundred seventy two patients were 
excluded from analysis because they were, either, 
under regular physical activity (n = 40), were un￾der 20 years old (n = 25), had no optimized drug 
therapy (n = 10), or interrupted test due to he￾modynamic or electrocardiographic complications 
(n = 40), respiratory limitations (n = 10), LVEF 
≥ 45% (n = 10), atrial fibrillation (n = 20), and 
pacemaker or implantable defibrillator (n = 15). 
The final sample included 483 patients with systo￾lic HF aged from 20 to 88 years, with stable dose 
of b-blocker for more than 3 months prior to the 
CPX. The patients were enrolled in six age groups 
ranging from 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 
60 to 69 and ≥ 70 years old. Clinical characteristics 
are listed in Table 1. 
The review board of the ethical committee at 
our institution had approved the study and it is in 
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.
Exercise testing
All referred patients had undergone maximal 
exercise testing using a modified Naughton pro￾tocol and a metabolic cart. CPX had been carried 
out on a programmable treadmill (TMX425 Stress 
Treadmill; TrackMaster, Newton, KS, USA) in 
a controlled-temperature room (21–23o
C) with 
monitoring of cardiac rhythm (CardioSoft 6.5; GE 
Medical Systems IT, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and 
blood pressure (Tango Stress BP; SunTech Medical 

www.cardiologyjournal.org 657
Emmanuel Gomes Ciolac et al., Effects of age on aerobic capacity in heart failure
Inc, Morrisville, NC, USA) as previously described 
[17]. The 12-lead electrocardiogram and HR had 
been monitored in the standing position before 
and throughout the exercise and recovery period. 
Ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon 
dioxide output (VCO2) had been measured breath-
-by-breath using a computerized system (Vmax 
Encore29; SensorMedics Corp., Yorba Linda, CA, 
USA). The RER had been recorded at each average 
sample obtained during each stage of the protocol. 
The highest VO2 uptake level (1 min mean) at the 
end of exercise was considered the peak VO2, and 
the VE/VCO2 slope was calculated by automatic 
linear regression fitting with the breath-by-breath 
values obtained throughout the whole exercise. 
Patients had been instructed and encouraged to 
exercise to their maximum capacity.
The predicted peak VO2 was calculated accor￾ding to normative values to age, sex and body 
weight by Wasserman et al. [18]. The percentage 
of predicted peak VO2 was determined by dividing 
the weight normalized peak VO2 by the predicted 
peak VO2 and then multiplying it by 100. Predicted 
maximum heart rate (HRmax) was determined by the 
equation HRmax = 164 – (0.7 × age), which was vali￾dated for patients receiving b-blocker therapy [19].
Statistical analysis
All data are reported as means ± standard 
deviation and the statistical program SPSS 13.0 for 
Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used 
to perform statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov-
-Smirnov test was applied to ensure a Gaussian 
distribution of the results. One-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze differences 
in the subject’s characteristics at baseline. Bon￾ferroni post hoc analysis was used to determine 
significance of data that was indicated by one-way 
ANOVA. Pearson correlation was used to assess 
the relationship between age and both peak VO2
and HRmax, and between age and percent predicted 
for them. Linear regression was used to generate 
equation to predict peak VO2 from age for HF 
patients receiving b-blocker therapy. Then, we 
calculated the predicted peak VO2 using this linear 
regression for patients taking b-blocker agents 
(VO2bb). The significance level was set at p < 0.05.

-ischemic HF etiology, as well as male subjects 
was greatest in all decades. The body mass index 
was significantly lower in the 20–29 year group 
when compared to patients in the 50’s and 60’s 
decades. The resting HR was significantly higher 
in the 20’s decade in relation to the 40’s, 50’s and 
60’s. LVEF and HF pharmacological therapy were 
not different among the groups. All patients were 
taking b-blockers (carvedilol 80%, bisoprolol 15% 
and metaprolol 5%) at maximum tolerated dose at 
the discretion of the treating physician.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test data are shown 
in Table 2. None of the exercise tests were termi￾nated secondary to electrocardiogram criteria and 
all patients stopped it by fatigue symptoms. The 
peak VO2 was significantly lower among patients 
in the 60’s and 70’s decades in relation to the 20’s, 
30’s and 40’s. We also observed that peak VO2
decreased approximately 0.9 mL/kg/min by deca￾de in this population. However, the percentage of 
the predicted peak VO2 and, the peak RER were 
similar in all groups, as well as their maximum and 
percentage of maximum HR. The other variable 
that was similar in all decades was VE/VCO2 slope.
The linear regression analysis of peak VO2 vs. 
age is shown in Figure 1. The intercept and slope 
were 20.93 ± 0.95 and –0.092 ± 0.018, respectively. 
So, the equation for estimated peak VO2bb to HF 
patients in b-blocker therapy is 20.934 – 0.092 × 
× age for whole population.
Table 2 shows the results of the new b-blocker 
prediction equation for peak VO2bb using a compu￾terized system in HF patients receiving b-blockers 
therapy underwent treadmill exercise testing. The 
peak VO2bb was not significantly different from the 
peak VO2 measured in all age-decades. However, 
the peak VO2bb was significantly different among 
all groups. The Figure 2 shows the interrelation 
between age, HRmax and peak VO2.
The correlations between age and peak VO2
(r = 0.21, p < 0.0001), and HRmax (r = 0.16, p = 
= 0.0007) were weak although statistically signi￾ficant (Fig. 3). The analysis for VE/VCO2 slope did 
not show correlation with age (r = 0.01, p = 0.6).
Discussion
The primary finding of the present study was that 
peak VO2 decreased 0.9 mL/kg/min for every 10-year 
increment in age in HF patients taking b-blockers. 
Additionally, our results show that aerobic function

(% predicted) did not differ among young, middle-
-aged and older patients with HF. The other finding in 
this investigation is that the new b-blocker equation 
for predicted peak VO2bb in this specific population 
between 20 and 88 years old corresponds to 20.934 – 
– 0.092 × age. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first study to determine an equation to predict peak 
VO2 and compare the effects of age on physical capa￾city among different decades in HF patients under￾going a CPX performed on a treadmill in all cases.
Two previous studies that have investigated 
the effect of age in HF patients showed a reduction 
in aerobic capacity [16, 17]. However, these authors 
analyzed these effects within broad aged groups 
and the exercise testing was completed using both 
treadmill and upright cycle ergometer. In spite of 
methodological differences, the decrease in value 
of peak VO2 was 1.0 mL/kg/min for every 7 years 
[16], which was similar to the findings in our study. 
The functional capacity is associated with age and 
begins to decline after age 30, with a more expo￾nential decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness and 
muscle strength after the age of 50 in apparently 
healthy individuals [20, 21]. This represents 
a decline in peak VO2 on average of 8% to 10% per 
decade [10–12]. Hence, age itself is an independent 
predictor for peak VO2. In previous specific inve￾stigations about aerobic capacity and aging in HF 
[16, 17] it was reported that physiologic reserve 
in HF is very reduced, which is supported by our 
results. Progressive decline in peak VO2 reflects 
the degree of disease’s severity and provides 
prognostic information in patients with HF [22].
However, our results demonstrated that the 
mean percent-predicted peak VO2 value for all 
groups was 45.8%, which may suggest that these 
patients are already in their comfort zone, consi￾dering age-decades. On the other hand, when new 
b-blocker equation for predicted peak VO2bb was used 
this reduction disappears. The peak VO2bb calculated 
by equation did not differ from the actual peak VO2
measured, so the percentage of predicted peak VO2bb
is around 100%. This finding itself indicates that 
both aerobic capacity and aerobic function, when 
adjusted by the equation, are in closer relationship 
with age than disease’s severity in patients with HF. 
Moreover, VE/VCO2 slope did not change among the 
Figure 3. Relationship between age and: A. Peak exercise oxygen consumption (peak VO2); B. Maximum heart rate (HRmax). 
There was a significant correlation between age and both A and B. Dashed lines represent 95% prediction interval.

consumption (peak VO2) and maximum heart rate (HRmax).

age-decades, reinforcing the theory that the fall in 
peak VO2 is not related to worsening of HF.
The results of the present study are accor￾ding to our previous investigation, which showed 
a cutoff point for peak VO2 of 12.5 mL/kg/min in HF 
patients undertaking b-blockers as better midterm 
prognosis [8].
The effects of physiologic aging are associated 
to declining in exercise capacity, HRmax and peak 
VO2 [11]. Although it was reported that the decline 
in peak VO2 seems to be primarily by reduction in 
HRmax [23], there was no significant difference in 
HRmax during age-decades among the groups.
The b-blocker therapy has become a primary 
pharmacologic intervention in patients with HF 
[24]. Previous report has shown that the maximal 
age-predicted HR depends on optimization of b-blo￾cker dosing in HF patient [2, 25]. In our study, the 
HR in maximal effort evaluation was 93.8 ± 4.9% 
of the predicted in the whole sample, estimated by 
the specific equation to predict HRmax in patients 
receiving this therapy [18]. Despite the tendency to 
HR decline during age-decades, the percentage of 
b-blocker predicted HRmax in middle-aged and older 
tends to be higher, which may suggest reduced in 
chronotropic reserve over the years in HF patients 
taking b-blockers [26]. 
Limitations of the study
This is a retrospective study using selected 
patients with HF referred to heart transplant of 
a single center. All patients underwent a single 
treadmill CPX to assess aerobic capacity. Even 
though data collection is not planned and statisti￾cal analysis is exploratory, all patients underwent 
testing on the same equipment and by the same 
team, which eliminates the differences in data 
collection and conduction. Considering the high 
morbidity and mortality in this population, the 
functional capacity decrease is probably higher 
over time, since decompensated patients or with 
excessive limitation cannot be evaluated by exer￾cise testing. However, our results are applicable 
to clinical setting where peak VO2 is an important 
prognostic parameter. Since present guidelines 
recommend cardiac rehabilitation for stable HF 
patients, excluding from analyses patients un￾dergoing regular physical activity is a limitation. 
However, the inclusion of small number of patients 
undergoing regular physical activity could bias 
study results. Future studies focused in analyzing 
how age affects stable HF patients compliant to 
exercise/cardiac rehabilitation guidelines are thus 
necessary. The number of patients between 20–29 
and ≥ 70 years was relatively small in comparison 
to the other groups, but the analysis showed that 
the sample size was sufficient to detect difference. 
Values of peak VO2 are lower for women than men 
[27], however we did not analyze it separately 
due to the small number of women in the sample. 
Finally, the new equation for predicted peak VO2 
in HF patients undertaking b-blockers is based on 
treadmill only and cannot be extrapolated to upright 
cycle ergometer exercise test. 
Clinical implication
The present finding shows an inverse and 
decreased association between aerobic capacity 
and aging in HF patients taking b-blockers. This 
association derives from patients who underwent 
a treadmill CPX. The finding suggests that a re￾duction in peak VO2 higher than 0.9 mL/kg/min 
per decade may indicate a significant worsening 
in aerobic capacity and may not reflect the expec￾ted decline in aerobic function in HF patients. 
The similarity between measured and calculated 
peak VO2 in all age-decades suggests that there 
is no functional physiologic reserve associated 
to aging in HF. Peak VO2 is used for clinical 
decision-making regarding the need for cardiac 
transplantation in all age-decades. However, the 
cutoff value was determined in middle-aged HF 
patient predominantly. Therefore, we may specu￾late that age-decades difference in peak VO2 could 
be an important factor for clinical decision-making 
in patients with HF.
Conclusions
In summary, this investigation suggests that 
age-adjusted peak VO2 may describe more accura￾tely the degree of aerobic capacity impairment in 
HF patients. This evidence should be considered 
when using the peak VO2 for prognostic strati￾fication and clinical decision-making in patients 
with HF.
