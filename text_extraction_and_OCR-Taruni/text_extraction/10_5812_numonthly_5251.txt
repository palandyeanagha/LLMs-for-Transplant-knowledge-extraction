ABSTRACT
Background: Nephrolithiasis is a widespread multifactorial disorder. Constitutional, environmental and genetic factors play a role in stone 
formation. Although important advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of stone formation, none of the many 
theories have given a satisfactory explanation of this process.
Objectives: The objective of study was to evaluate the probable relationship between cigarette smoking and nephrolitiasis in adult men.
Patients and Methods: A total of 102 cases diagnosed with nepholithiasis and 121 age-matched healthy controls were recruited from June 2010 
to September 2011. Smoking status and resultant data was obtained from both groups.
Results: Twenty seven (26.5%) of the patients with stones and eighteen (14.9%) of the control group were current cigarette smokers. Our 
findings showed that smoking significantly increases the risk of nepholithiasis (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.06-4.01, P = 0.034). There was no significant 
difference in the number of cigarettes smoked (P = 0.830) and years of smoking (P = 0.536) between subjects with and without stones (P = 
0.536).
Conclusions: This study suggests that cigarette smoking might be an independent risk factor for the development of nephrolithiasis.

1. Background
Renal stones or nephrolithiasis is a common challenge 
and affects populations worldwide. The worldwide preva￾lence of nephrolithiasis is between 2 and 20%. However, 
this prevalence varies by age, sex and race (1). Nephroli￾thiasis imposes a significant burden on human health 
and the economy. It is estimated that almost 50% of stone 
formers will have a recurrence within 10 years (2). A posi￾tive family history of nephrolithiasis is strongly associ￾ated with increased stone risk. Relative risk in those with 
a positive family history is 2.5 times higher (3).
Studies have shown that the prevalence of kidney 
stones is increasing in adults globally. The reasons for 
this increase are not clear. Changes in dietary habits, life-

styles and increased rates of obesity are thought to be 
contributing factors (4). In certain areas of the world, as 
in the Middle East, the lifetime risk appears to be higher 
(20% to 25%) (5). In Iran, the reported prevalence of neph￾rolithiasis is 5.7% and is more common in the central and 
southwest provinces (6).
Renal stone disease is a multifactorial disorder. Consti￾tutional, environmental and genetic factors play a major 
role in the development of stones. Although important 
advances have been made in understanding the patho￾physiology of stone formation, none of the many theo￾ries have provided a satisfactory explanation of this pro￾cess (7).
Cigarette smoking is clearly identified as the chief pre￾ventable cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. 
Despite growing knowledge about the adverse health and 
economic consequences of smoking, the pervasiveness of 
smoking remains alarmingly high. Cigarette smoke con￾tains more than 4,000 substances known to be antigenic, 
cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Many of these 
substances produce significant physiologic effects on hu￾man body and can harm almost every organ (8).
It has been posited by some authors that trace elements 
such as magnesium, zinc, aluminum, iron and copper 
may have role in lithogenesis but this contention is still 
under debating. Probably some of them may contribute 
or, conversely, inhibit crystal nucleation of stone compo￾nents (9, 10). The concentration of these trace elements 
and heavy metals in body tissues is elevated in cigarette 
smokers (11). Recent studies indicated that Lead and Cad￾mium induced glomerular dysfunction in smokers, pos￾sibly due to high serum levels in smokers than nonsmok￾ers (12). Based on the above finding, smoking may affect 
stone formation. Some epidemiological data links smok￾ing with the risk of stones (13, 14).
2. Objectives
Since nephrolithiasis is considered as a complex dis￾ease, identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms 
and the independent preventable risk factors could help 
decrease the number of patients suffering from this mal￾ady. The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible rela￾tionship between kidney stones and the smoking status 
of patients.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1. Patients
We conducted a case-control study from June 2010 to 
September 2011. Adult men (≥ 18 years old) who were 
newly diagnosed as having a stone in the upper urinary 
tract in nephrology clinic of Fatemieh Hospital during 
this period were enrolled as cases. This hospital is a uni￾versity affiliated center for kidney diseases in Semnan, 
Iran. Nephrolithiasis was diagnosed by ultrasonography 
and radiography. Eligibility and final diagnosis was con￾firmed by a university nephrologist.
Age (± five years) matched controls were randomly se￾lected from subjects receiving routine preventive health 
examinations at the same hospital during the same pe￾riod. The controls had no history and no clinical and im￾aging finding of urinary stones. All study subjects lived in 
Semnan city In center of Iran.
3.2. Study Design
Written informed consent was obtained from each 
participant in this study. The project was approved by 
research committee of Semnan university of medical 
science. Patients with well-documented conditions that 
increased the risk of formation of stones including gout, 
primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, 
diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease, chronic urinary tract 
infection, chronic diarrhea, renal failure and anatomi￾cal abnormality were excluded. Ultrasonography and 
radiogical studies were performed in order to exclude 
anatomical abnormality. All subjects were visited by a 
nephrologist and given a questionnaire which included 
questions about their age, the family history of stone 
disease and smoking status. The information about use 
of cigarettes was collected with regard to the duration of 
use, and the daily number of consumption. Subjects were 
defined as cigarette smokers if they had smoked five or 
more cigarettes per day for at least six months. Intermit￾tent and former smokers were excluded.
3.3. Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by Kolmogrov-Smirnov, t test and lo￾gistic regression using SPSS 18.0.P-values of less than 0.05 
were considered statistically significant.
4. Results
In this cross-sectional study, 102 male patients with kid￾ney stones and 121 healthy control subjects were evalu￾ated. The mean (± SD) age of patients was 42.5 ± 14.1 years 
and the controls were 42.8 ± 16.1 and showed no signifi￾cant difference (P = 0.870). Age distribution in case and 
control subjects is shown in Table 1 . First-degree relative 
family history of nephrolithiasis was positive in 42.2% (n 
= 43) of cases.
Among the cases with stones, 27 (26.5%) of subjects were 
current regular cigarette smokers whereas in the control 
group 18 (14.9%) were smokers. The mean (± SD) number 
of smokers was 15.1 ± 9.5 in the cases and 14.6 ± 4.4 in the 
control group and was not significantly different (P = 
0.830). The mean (± SD) duration of smoking was 19.1 ± 
11.9 and 17.2 ± 95.5 years in patients and control subjects, 
respectively. There was also no significant difference in 
years of smoking between subjects with and without 
stones (P = 0.536).

5. Discussion
The influence of smoking on human health is an impor￾tant worldwide problematic issue. In recent years, spe￾cial attention has been paid to different socioeconomic, 
alimentary, occupational, and environmental factors’ 
effects on the pathophysiology of urinary stone forma￾tion. One of the variables is smoking and a few published 
studies have examined the association between smoking 
and kidney stone disease (15).
In this study, the proportion of smokers among patients 
with nephrolithiasis was significantly higher than in the 
control subjects. Cigarette smoking was 2.06 times more 
common in stone formers than in the control group. 
Hence, smoking may be an independent risk factor for 
nephrolithiasis.
Urinary tract stones were found to be more common 
among workers chronically exposed to cadmium as 
compared to the general population (16). One of the pos￾sible factors which may explain the effect of smoking on 
stone formation is a high body cadmium and lead level in 
smokers. Cigarette smoking may induce urolithiasis by 
decreasing urinary flow and increasing serum cadmium 
in healthy subjects (17, 18). Also, Scott et al in their study 
proposed that increased serum cadmium levels associat￾ed with cigarette smoking may be a risk factor for urinary 
tract stone formation (19).
Another possible explanation is the increase in plasma 
arginine vasopressin level in smokers. Lower urine out￾put is thought to be an important risk factor for urinary 
stone formation. Arginine vasopressin has a strong an￾tidiuretic action (20). Mooser reported that significant 
increases in plasma arginine vasopressin levels were as￾sociated with cigarette smoking (21). Therefore, cigarette 
smoking may further decrease urinary output which 
may be a potential trigger for stone formation.
On the other hand, smoking can increase production 
of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in the kid￾ney, leading to renal injury (22). These injuries increase 
the nucleation, aggregation, and retention of crystals in 
the kidney thereby promoting the formation of stones 
(23, 24). Stones are more common in men than in women 
(2). Since smoking tends to be more common in men this 
may be one of the reasons for higher rate of stones in 
male sufferers.
In accordance with our finding, Liu et al. evaluated the 
impact of cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing on 
the risk of calcium urolithiasis. They showed that ciga￾rette smoking (OR=1.66; 95% 95%CI: 1.11–2.50; P = 0.014) was 
an independent risk factor for the development of calci￾um urolithiasis (14). Similarly, Hamano et al. confirmed 
that calcium oxalate stones are strongly associated with 
several coronary heart disease risk factors which include 
smoking habits. In this study, they found cigarettes can 
increase the risk of urolithiasis by as much as 4.29-fold 
(25).
In contrast to our findings, Siojewski et al. in their study 
do not support the possible association between smok￾ing, trace elements and urinary tract stones. They believe 
that further investigationis needed in this area (13). In an￾other study, the associations between diet and the risk of 
kidney stones in male smokers was evaluated. Following5 
years of follow-up, they concluded that smoking had not 
been found to be related to higher risk of lithogenesis 
(26).
Our findings showed that there was not a significant 
difference in number of cigarettes and the duration of 
smoking between the two groups. This may imply that 
smoking per se, versus duration and number, is a risk fac￾tor for stone formation. However, our study has several 
limitations. Firstly, our study sample was not large, thus 
limiting the variable of stronger statistical significance.

Secondly, we did not do analysis to determine the type 
of stones. Smoking may affect the formation of a specific 
kind of urinary stone. Third, some confounding variables 
such as dietary habits were not matched between the two 
groups.
In conclusion, our findings implied that cigarette smok￾ing may be a risk factor for urinary stone formation. 
Therefore, further studies, especially large population￾based and with consideration of other etiologic factors, 
is needed to better clarify the possible effect of smoking 
on stone formation.
