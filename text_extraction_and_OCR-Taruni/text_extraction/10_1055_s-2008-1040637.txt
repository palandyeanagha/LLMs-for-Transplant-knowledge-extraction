Beyond the milestone in transplantation repre￾sented by the introduction of cyclosporine as an im￾munosuppressant, other factors have continued to 
operate to enhance survival rates for liver recipients. 
Previous studies have stressed the importance of 
venous bypass,' the proper use of retransplanta￾ti~n,~ andrefinements in the use of cyclosporine 
along with antilymphocyte preparations in effect￾ing these additional improvement^.^ Each of these 
factors is reviewed in detail elsewhere in this issue 
of Seminars. 
At the same time, better overall survival rates 
have served to underscore the need to develop 
criteria that might aid in defining a population of 
patients upon whom the effects of better immuno￾suppression and better technique have had little or 
no impact. The purpose of the present study is to 
determine whether an assessment of certain recog￾nizable and measurable patient characteristics might 
aid in predicting survival (Fig. 1). More specifically, 
the primary interest is to elucidate those factors 
other than rejection itself or technical failures that 
seriously hinder survival. Only adults will be con￾sidered, since a preliminary examination of data 
suggested that such preoperative patient character￾istics are much less important in predicting survival 
among children. Only 6-month survival will be 
examined because the few patients who die after 
that date seldom die from causes related to their 
preoperative status.

METHODS 
A total of 160 adult patients received primary, 
orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of 
Pittsburgh Health Center between July 1, 198 1, and 
December 31, 1984. Of these, 35 eventually required 
retransplantation and seven were considered opera￾tive deaths. For survival calculations, only those 
118 patients surviving at least 1 day and not requir￾ing more than one graft were included. For con￾sideration of factors that influence blood loss 
during the first transplant operation, all 160 pa￾tients were included. 
Clinical Variables 
Patient variables considered included age, diag￾nosis, race, sex, date of transplantation, number of 
transplants, duration of survival, measurements of 
serum bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, and the pro￾thrombin time. All patients were given scores (based 
on a retrospective review of their preoperative 
records) in the following categories: 
1. Coma (COMA): A score of 2 was assigned 
for those patients experiencing episodes of stage 3 
or 4 coma; a score of 1, for those with intermittent 
episodes of moderate to severe confusion or fre￾quent problems with mild to moderate confusion; 
and a score of 0, for those with no gross evidence 
of encephalopathy. 
2. Malnutrition (MALN): A score of 2 was as￾signed for those with severe muscle wasting and 
obvious evidence of generalized malnutrition; a 
score of 1, for those with less severe malnutrition; 
and a score of 0 for those with no obvious signs of 
poor nutrition.

FIG. 1. Sigrnoid curve showing proposed relationship be￾tween prospective patient variables and probability of sur￾vival following liver transplantation. 
3. Ascites (ASCI): A score of 2 was assigned 
for those with massive, uncontrollable ascites; a 
score of 1, for those with moderate or controllable 
ascites; and a score of 0, for those with no evidence 
of ascites. 
4. Miscellaneous: If a history of recurrent vari￾ceal bleeding, biliary sepsis, or spontaneous bac￾terial peritonitis, was present, a score of 1 was as￾signed, 0 if absent. 
5. Previous Surgery: In addition, each patient 
was assigned an index of previous operative proce￾dures (IOP), which was an additive score as fol￾lows: multiple previous biliary reconstructions, 2; 
and a single attempt, 1; portosystemic shunt proce￾dure, 2; splenectomy, open liver biopsy, cholecys￾tectomy, or other procedures in the upper abdomen, 
1 for each separate laparotomy. 
Operative blood losses (RBC) were determined 
by a review of the records of the Central Blood 
Bank of Pittsburgh and are expressed in terms of 
the units of packed red blood cells administered to 
the patient during the transplant operation. 
Statistical Methods 
Complete survival data were available for all 
patients to 6 months. Life-table analysis was used to 
calculate survival probabilities for intervals beyond 
6 months. Multiple linear regression was used 
initially to examine the effects of the different vari￾ables on 6-month survival. Simple two-way linear 
regression was used to examine the isolated effect of 
each variable on survival and on RBC. 
Unpaired sample means were compared using 
the unpaired t test, and proportions compared with 
the chi-square test, using Yates correction when 
indicated. Risk ratios, which are an estimate of the 
relative risk associated with a variable, were calcu￾lated for different score groups and 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated using the standard error of 
the risk ratio. 
Disease Scoring System 
Finally, a disease scoring system was developed 
based on an examination of those factors most 
often associated with an eventual poor outcome. 
The scoring system was extensively modified by trial 
and error to allow a maximum separation between 
those patients who survived for 6 months and those 
who did not. 
RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the results of a simple two-way 
analysis of the variables using linear regression. 
Survival at 6 months was found to correlate inverse￾ly and to a significant degree (see p values in Table 
1) with RBC, COMA, MALN, bilirubin, and pro￾thrombin time, and directly with the date of the 
transplant operation. It did not correlate to a sig￾nificant degree with the patients' age, sex, race, or 
diagnosis, or with IOP or ASCI scores. Stepwise 
multiple linear regression analysis revealed RBC to 
have the highest inverse correlation with survival @ 
< 0.0001), followed by COMA @ = 0.0001). How￾ever, because of multicolinearity, the addition to 
the equation of the remaining scores of disease 
severity did not improve the correlation. Further 
work with various combinations of COMA, ASCI, 
and MALN scores revealed the best inverse correla￾TABLE 1. Survival After Orthotopic Liver

tion with survival was that obtained by adding 
COMA and MALN scores. 
The effect of RBC on survival in patients with 
different scores in the COMA, MALN, and ASCI 
categories was examined (Table 2). In those patients 
with marked encephalopathy (COMA = 2), the 
negative correlation of blood loss with survival was 
significant (p = 0.045) but less pronounced than in 
those with minimal or no encephalopathy (p = 
0.0004). The negative correlation of RBC with sur￾vival was significant (p = 0.001) in patients with 
fair to good nutritional status (MALN = 1 or 0), 
but not (p = 0.063) in those patients with severe 
malnutrition (MALN = 2). This may have been an 
effect of colinearity between RBC and MALN in 
the analysis, since mean RBC in the MALN = 2 
group (50.2 f 58.6 units) was markedly higher than 
in the lower MALN score group (23.4 * 24.6 
units). Finally, the correlation of better survival 
with lower blood loss was more pronounced in 
those patients with massive ascites (ASCI = 2) than 
in those with low ASCI scores (p < 0.0001, F = 
20.50 versus p = 0.027, F = 5.12, respectively). 
Figures 2 through 4 show life-table curves for 
the COMA and MALN score groups and for 
various RBC groups. The correlation of high RBC 
with high scores in MALN, COMA, or ASCI cate￾gories as well as with other variables was also 
examined with linear regression analysis (Table 3). 
A high degree of correlation was found between 
high blood loss (RBC the dependent variable) and 
COMA score (p < 0.001), MALN score (p = 
0.0005), ASCI score (p = 0.0001), and 
prothrombin time (p = 0.006). A significant nega￾tive correlation was found between RBC and the 
use of venous bypass (p = 0.040) and the date of 
transplantation (p = 0.002), a more recent trans￾plant date correlating with lower blood losses. Total 
RBC did not correlate with diagnosis, bilirubin, 
age, or a history of previous variceal bleeding. The 
correlation of high RBC with IOP, the index of 
previous surgical procedures, was also not signifi￾cant (although p = 0.066).

An examination of the various values of R~ (R 
= correlation coefficient) for the different regres￾sions revealed that most were less than 10%. This 
suggests that a linear model is not appropriate for 
defining the relationship between the variables. In 
fact, in a scatterplot of different variables on the X 
axis versus survival probabilities on the Y axis, the 
curves defined for each metric variable (such as 
bilirubin levels, RBC, or prothrombin times) were 
sigmoid in shape (Fig. 1). This suggests that the 
relationship between survival and many of these pa￾tient variables might best be described by a third 
order equation, that is, y = f (x).~ 
An examination of the sigmoid curve in Figure 
1 demonstrates how the probability of survival falls 
off sharply at a certain value of each patient vari￾able. This observation was the basis for construct￾ing a disease scoring system that would allow one to 
place patients into one of the three groups deline￾ated by the two inflection points along the sigmoid 
curve. Those with a disease score in the flat, upper 
left part of the curve would represent relatively low￾risk patients, and those in the flat portion of the 
lower right section of the curve would clearly be 
high-risk patients. Those patients with scores 
placing them between the inflection points of the 
curve would represent a group for whom the rela￾tive risks for transplantation would be difficult to 
estimate, since small errors in scoring (motion along 
the X axis in Figure 1) would drastically alter esti￾mates of survival probability (position along the Y 
axis). 
Development of the Disease 
Scoring System 
The scoring procedure developed was that 
which proved most useful in defining a clear separa￾tion between the highest and lowest risk groups. 
This was accomplished mainly by trial and error. 
During this process, patients who had low-risk 
scores but died from causes related to surgical or 
immunologic factors and not to their preexisting 
liver disease were eliminated from consideration. 
This represented 7 of the 22 patients who died by 6 
months. They are listed in Table 4 along with the 
causes of death. 
The disease score is determined by adding the 
COMA, MALN, and ASCI scores together, with 
the following modifications: (I) If the patient is in a 
deep coma at the time of going to the operating 
room for the transplant, the COMA score is in￾creased to 6; (2) an additional 1 point is given if the 
patient's age is more than 40 years; (3) 2 additional 
points are given if the serum bilirubin level is higher

less than 10 mg/dl; (6) if the resulting score is 5 or 
greater, 2 points should be subtracted if the pa￾tient's age is less than 25 years; and (7) the marked 
effect on survival of the RBC is accounted for as 
follows: for patients with a total score of 5 or more, 
1 point can be subtracted if RBC is 10 units or less; 
for all patients, if RBC is 40 units or more, an addi￾tional 1 point should be added to the total score. 
Patients with a resultant score of 0 to 3 repre￾sent relatively low-risk patients. Those with a score 
of 7 or more are at high risk. Those with scores 
from 4 to 6 are located between the inflection 
points of the sigmoid curve and thus represent pa￾tients whose relative risks are difficult to estimate. 
REVIEW OF RETROSPECTIVE SCORING 
The mean score of those patients who died by 6 
months (except those patients listed in Table 4) was 
6.3 3.1, compared with 2.1 +- 1.9 for those who 
survived at least 6 months @ < 0.0001). Mean 
scores before and after April 1, 1983, were 4.0 k 
5.6 and 3.3 k 8.2, respectively (p > 0.50). Thus, 
the improvement in survival occurring after that 
date does not appear to be the result of selection of 
lower risk patients (Table 5). 
Causes of Death After 6 Months 
Eight of the 96 patients who survived 6 months 
subsequently died during the follow-up period. Re￾currence of tumor was the cause of death in four of 
these patients (all whose disease scores were 1 or 0), 
at intervals of 265, 480, 490, and 617 days after 
transplantation. Two men, ages 53 and 38 years 
with scores of 0 and 2, died in foreign countries, at 
426 and 905 days, respectively, of causes that were 
unclear but thought to be of cardiac origin. A fifth 
patient, a 44-year-old man whose preoperative score 
would have been 7, died after 439 days with hepatic 
failure and sepsis related to recurrent hepatitis B. 
Finally, a 20-year-old man, (disease score = 3), 
died 339 days postoperatively following massive 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
High-Risk Patients Surviving 
More Than 6 Months 
Only 2 of the 96 patients who survived beyond 6 
months had scores in the high-risk range. One was a 
45-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis 
who is a remarkable exception to the rule. Her pse￾operative score would have been 9. The second pa￾tient was the 44-year-old man mentioned in the pre￾ceding discussion. Both patients required extended 
rehabilatation periods, particularly the woman. 
Five other patients had preliminary scores 
ranging from 5 to 8 that were reduced by 2 points 
because of ages less than 25 years. All are alive and 
well after recovery periods that were relatively short 
when compared with the group of older patients 
with scores of 6 to 9. This experience is the basis for

the reduction of score related to age less than 25 
years. 
Low-Risk Patients Surviving 
Less Than 6 Months 
Besides the exceptions listed in Table 4, two 
other patients who died in less than 6 months had 
scores of 0 and 3. One was a 19-year-old girl who 
died of disseminated herpes zoster, and the other 
was a 52-year-old woman who required multiple 
surgical reexplorations for intra-abdominal bleeding 
and sepsis. 
Patients with Scores Between the 
Inflection Points 
Five patients who did not survive at least 6 
months and 14 who did had scores between 4 and 6. 
One of those who died had a score of 8 before 
reduction to 6 for an age of 18 years. Death in two 
was related to opportunistic infection arising at 1 
and 4 months following discharge, most likely re￾lated to overimmunosuppression. Two others died 
largely as the result of surgical complications. 
Three of the surviving patients (with scores of 
5, 5, and 4), required prolonged hospitalization (4 
months to more than 1 year) for rehabilitation and 
for treatment of various surgical complications. The 
others experienced rather uneventful recoveries that 
were free of surgical complications. 
Scoring of Retransplanted Patients 
A group of 33 out of 35 patients who required 
retransplantation were scored subsequent to devel￾opment of the system (Table 5). (Two patients were 
eliminated from consideration because they under￾went transplantation using venous bypass with full 
systemic heparinization.) Four of these patients re￾quired three transplants, of whom two are still alive 
at 2 and 3 years. Blood loss at the first transplant 
operation only was considered for scoring purposes. 
Coma scores were given on the basis of mental 
status at the time of reoperation. All other variables 
were scored on the basis of their values prior to the 
first transplant operation. 
Among the 18 retransplanted patients who died 
within 6 months of the first transplant operation, 
scores ranged from 6 to 12, with the exception of 
one patient with a score of 0. That patient died 176 
days after the first transplant from acute colchicine 
toxicity. The mean score of the remaining 17 pa￾tients was 9.2 * 1.8). The major factor contribut￾ing to high scores for 16 of these patients was that 
of coma scores of 6, indicating stage I11 or IV coma 
at the time of retransplantation. 
Of the remaining 15 patients who were retrans￾planted, 14 are alive from 14 to 43 months follow￾ing their first transplant. The one patient who died 
had an arterial thrombosis in the second graft and 
was not transplanted a third time. Scores in this 
group ranged from 0 to 6, with a mean of 2.3 + 
1.7). None of these patients were in a coma at the 
time of retransplantation, although four were re￾transplanted urgently, two for accelerated acute re￾jection and two for primary nonf~nction.~ 
Estimation of Relative Risks 
Table 6 summarizes the scoring for those 11 1 
patients used in developing the disease scoring 
system. Relative risk ratios were calculated from a 
chi-square table (with Yates correction when indi￾cated) and 95% confidence limits estimated. A 
score of 7 or higher carries a 41 (95% confidence 
range 7.29 to 231) times greater risk of dying within 
the first 6 months following transplantation than 
does a lower score. The risk ratios and confidence 
limits for other scores, along with chi-square values, 
are shown in Table 6. Another way of interpreting 
each ratio is to use the inverse argument. Thus, not 
only are patients with a score of 7 or higher 41 
times more likely to die within 6 months of trans￾plantation, but those with a score of 6 or less are 41 
times more likely to survive the first 6 months than 
are patients with a higher score. Of course, the 95% 
confidence intervals for all scores are quite wide in

range. For example, the relative risk for a patient 
with a score of 7 or above has a 95% chance of 
being as high as 231 times greater or as low as 7.29 
times greater than the relative risk for a patient with 
a score of 6 or less. 
Effect of Previous Surgery on Blood Loss 
The mean RBC loss for patients with various 
operations and the comparison with that for pa￾tients with no history of prior surgery is shown in 
Table 7. Several comparisons were made. A group 
of 31 patients who had had either bile duct recon￾structions, cholecystectomies, or any kind of shunt 
procedure were compared with the 129 patients who 
had undergone either no perihepatic surgery or 
minimal procedures, such as open liver biopsy or 
exploratory laparotomy. Mean blood loss of the 
former group (35.4 +. 35.5 units) was not signifi￾cantly more O) > 0.10) than that of the latter (28.7 
k 34.8 units). A second comparison between 14 
patients with duct surgery only and the 129 without 
surgery also revealed no significant differences in 
RBC (31.4 ? 33.8 units, p > 0.50). However, the 
mean RBC for patients with shunts (70.5 ? 46.0 
units) was greater O) < 0.01) than for the other 
groups. (The range of blood loss for shunt patients 
was 7 to 143 units.) 
DISCUSSION 
Perhaps more so than for most surgical proce￾dures, candidates for liver transplantation present in 
a wide range of physiologic conditions. Although 
the most important reasons for failure in these pa￾tients are still related to rejection, with the introduc￾tion of cyclosporine and following major improve￾ments in surgical technique, the overall physiologic 
condition of the individual patient has assumed an 
even greater role in influencing the eventual out￾come following transplantation. This became partic￾ularly evident when, in a previous study, we 
examined the overall impact of venous bypass on

survival and discovered that, although the proba￾bility of surviving to 30 days was markedly im￾proved, by 6 months patients transplanted with the 
use of bypass no longer appeared to have an ad￾vantage over those transplanted without bypass. 
Further investigation revealed that the bulk of the 
patients in the bypass group who died between 30 
and 180 days could be classified, based on physio￾logic characteristics that they had before surgery, as 
belonging to a particularly high-risk category. The 
major purpose of the current study, then, was to 
determine whether a scoring system could be de￾veloped that would allow easier recognition of those 
patients for whom the probability of survival, 
despite all of the recent improvements in immuno￾suppression and technique, is still unacceptably low. 
A key to developing the scoring system was the 
definition of a population of patients for whom 
death or survival was related more to preoperative 
condition than to technical failures or failure of the 
hepatic allograft related to poor procurement, rejec￾tion, or surgical erorrs. Restricting the analysis to 
those patients who had only one liver transplant 
went a long way toward accomplishing this goal, 
largely because of an aggressive attitude in the Pitts￾burgh program toward early retransplantation of 
patients with a failing graft (see accompanying 
article "Retransplantation of the Liver" in this issue 
of Seminars). Other patients were eliminated from 
consideration solely for the purpose of developing 
the scoring system. The causes of failure in these 
patients are no less important to examine. As far as 
the accuracy of the scoring system is concerned, 
patients who fail to follow predicted courses may 
truly represent exceptions that prove the rule. 
Examination of the causes of failure in these pa￾tients may, in fact, reveal lessons ultimately more 
important than those provided by the scoring 
system itself. This is because, by and large, the 
scoring system can only make predictions that most 
physicians experienced in the field already know to 
be true. 
Nevertheless, some important findings are 
worth reiterating. 
Many patient variables, which in the overall 
analysis have no significant impact, do make a dif￾ference among certain groups. For example, overall, 
age itself is not a factor that correlates with survi￾val. However, patients younger than 25 years of age 
who otherwise have high scores appear to have an 
advantage over those who are older. An age over 40 
years does not influence the probability of survival 
in the overall group, or in all of the diagnostic cate￾gories, with the exception of cirrhosis. In the latter 
group, however, the correlation of poor survival

with age over 40 years appears to be more related to 
the coexistence of other risk factors in these older 
patients than to age itself. The extra 1 point added 
to scores for an age over 40 years, then, is largely to 
account for the observation that most older patients 
have had their liver disease for a longer period of 
time. Ultimately, its inclusion appeared to provide 
greater score separation of the survivors from non￾survivors. 
The most striking finding of the study is that 
of all the factors studied, survival at 6 months cor￾relates most strongly with RBC. In a sense, RBC is 
probably a kind of metric scoring system in itself. 
This is suggested by the observation that RBC cor￾relates most strongly with those other factors with 
which survival also correlates, namely, the COMA 
and MALN scores and serum bilirubin and pro￾thrombin time. At the same time, RBC clearly can 
play an active role in altering the eventual outcome. 
This is suggested by the observations that patients 
with high scores who have low blood losses appear 
to obtain an advantage over those with high scores 
and higher blood loss, and all patients, regardless of 
score, appear to have a lower survival probability if 
RBC exceeds 40 units. 
In this series of patients, neither RBC nor sur￾vival correlated with a history of previous surgery. 
This was true if one included any history of surgery 
around the liver, such as a cholecystectomy, open 
liver biopsy, one or multiple bile duct procedures, 
or shunt procedures. With one exception, it was 
also true when the larger group was broken down 
into smaller groups and individual procedures were 
considered. 
The one exception was the group of six patients 
who had had portosystemic shunts. Mean blood 
loss in these six was 70.5 units, but it was accounted 
for almost entirely by four patients. Three of these 
four patients died on the operating table. The 
fourth survived surgery and an operative blood loss 
of 104 units, but died 4 months later, at home, of 
an opportunistic infection. Two other patients had 
RBC less than 20 units and have survived for 9 and 
10 months. These last two patients and the other 
one who survived surgery were all three transplanted 
using venous bypass, whereas the three who died 
during surgery were not. 
The study makes several other things quite 
clear. It adds statistical confirmation to notions 
most surgeons in the field already hold. 
1. Patients taken to the operating room in deep 
coma from chronic liver disease almost never sur￾vive. Their score places them on the flat, high-risk 
portion of the sigmoid curve. If the status of these 
patients can be improved to the point that they are 
awake and able to breath without ventilatory sup￾port, and if they undergo a technically smooth 
operation with low blood loss and without surgical 
complications, then they probably begin their 
recovery period between the inflection points, 
perhaps even high up toward the lower risk portion 
of the curve. The same holds true for patients 
undergoing retransplantation. No one in a deep 
coma and requiring a second or third liver has sur￾vived long term. 
The example of the one patient in this series in 
stage IV coma from acute hepatic necrosis who sur￾vived long term underscores the need to act quickly, 
if at all, in the setting of acute and fulminant 
hepatic failure. Long-term support, beyond a few 
days, of a patient in stage IV coma with an extreme 
coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and other profound 
metabolic derangements will seldom result in a suc￾cessful outcome. The decision to transplant must be 
made with little hesitation and a suitable donor 
found quickly. 
2. The negative influence that a history of peri￾hepatic surgery has had in previous reports has 
become much less important in recent years. The 
routine use of venous bypass may have had an im￾portant role in minimizing the specter of previous 
surgery. 
3. Poor surgical technique or errors in surgical 
judgment can quickly obliterate the significance of 
any preoperative scoring system. In general, pa￾tients in better overall physiologic condition will 
tolerate most complications better than their less 
resilient counterparts. However, the health of all of 
these patients is compromised to begin with, and 
the additional burden of long operative procedures 
and immunosuppression leaves little room for 
errors. 
4. The improvement in survival correlating 
with a transplant date later than the spring of 1983 
reflects several developments. One is the full-scale 
use of venous bypass, introduced about 6 weeks 
before. The other is most likely the creation of a 
liver transplant team by the anesthesiologists in 
Pittsburgh and the evolvement of a more uniform 
and informed approach to the operative manage￾ment of these patients.435 
Finally, emphasis must be placed on the 
empirical nature of the scoring system. A much 
larger population of patients to study might allow 
more accurate mathematical description of the rela￾tionship between the variables and the survival 
probability. In addition, the system may not apply 
very well to other centers where differences in surgi￾cal technique or pre- and postoperative management 
of patients may drastically alter eventual outcome

in some or even all patients. In the final analysis, 
one of the most exciting prospects of the present 
study would be to discover that such things really 
will make a difference. 
SUMMARY 
A group of 118 adults who underwent primary, 
orthotopic transplantation of the liver over a 4-year 
period served as the subjects of a detailed examina￾tion of their ability to survive the first 6 months as 
a function of their preoperative condition. As a re￾sult, a scoring system was developed empirically in 
an attempt to separate very high-risk from relatively 
low-risk patients. The scoring method is based on 
the high degree of correlation between survival 
probability and various patient characteristics. It 
allows for additional scoring to account for the 
dramatic effect of operative blood loss on the 
eventual outcome. The curve that best describes the 
relationship between patient scores and survival 
probability is sigmoidal in shape. Many patients will 
have scores' located on the curve between the inflec￾tion points. They represent a group whose relative 
risk is difficult to estimate but for whom operative 
blood loss or the occurrence of surgical complica￾tions may prove particularly telling.
