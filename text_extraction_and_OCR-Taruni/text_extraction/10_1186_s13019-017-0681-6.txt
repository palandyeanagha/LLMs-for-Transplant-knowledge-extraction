Abstract
Background: Myocardial inflammation and injury occur during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We
aimed to characterise these processes during routine CABG surgery to inform the diagnosis of type 5 myocardial
infarction.
Methods: We assessed 87 patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective CABG surgery.
Myocardial inflammation, injury and infarction were assessed using plasma inflammatory biomarkers, high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) using both late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO).
Results: Systemic humoral inflammatory biomarkers (myeloperoxidase, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and c-reactive
protein) increased in the post-operative period with C-reactive protein concentrations plateauing by 48 h (median
area under the curve (AUC) 7530 [interquartile range (IQR) 6088 to 9027] mg/L/48 h). USPIO-defined cellular
myocardial inflammation ranged from normal to those associated with type 1 myocardial infarction (median 80.2
[IQR 67.4 to 104.8] /s). Plasma hs-cTnI concentrations rose by ≥50-fold from baseline and exceeded 10-fold the
upper limit of normal in all patients. Two distinct patterns of peak cTnI release were observed at 6 and 24 h. After
CABG surgery, new LGE was seen in 20% (n = 18) of patients although clinical peri-operative type 5 myocardial
infarction was diagnosed in only 9% (n = 8). LGE was associated with the delayed 24-h peak in hs-cTnI and its
magnitude correlated with AUC plasma hs-cTnI concentrations (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) but not systemic inflammation,
myocardial inflammation or bypass time.
Conclusion: Patients undergoing CABG surgery invariably have plasma hs-cTnI concentrations >10-fold the 99th
centile upper limit of normal that is not attributable to inflammatory or ischemic injury alone. Peri-operative type 5
myocardial infarction is often unrecognised and is associated with a delayed 24-h peak in plasma hs-cTnI
concentrations.

Background
Approximately 400,000 coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG) operations are performed each year in the
United States of America [1]. Cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB) during these procedures is known to induce sys￾temic and myocardial inflammation [2, 3]. Inflammatory
cytokines such a tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
depress cardiac function after CPB [4], whereas eleva￾tions of interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-8 are proportional to
levels of myocardial injury and apoptosis [5]. Elevated
cardiac troponin concentrations have been identified in
up to 100% of patients undergoing CABG [6]. However,
corresponding cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) evi￾dence of myocardial necrosis is evident in only 28% of
patients, suggesting that troponin release may reflect
reversible injury resulting from other processes such as
inflammation or ischaemia-reperfusion injury rather
than infarction [7]. The identification of clinically rele￾vant peri-operative myocardial injury and infarction can
be challenging but is important because it predicts short,
medium and long-term mortality [8, 9].
The universal definition of myocardial infarction
defines procedural (type 5) myocardial infarction as a >
10-fold elevation above the 99th centile of cardiac tropo￾nin within 48 h of CABG surgery accompanied by new
pathological Q waves or left bundle branch block, angio￾graphically documented new graft or new native coron￾ary artery occlusion, or imaging evidence of new loss of
viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnor￾mality [10]. Elevation of plasma cardiac troponin con￾centration is required but in the absence of these other
clinical features, is insufficient to make the diagnosis of
type 5 myocardial infarction.
The latest generation of high-sensitivity cardiac tropo￾nin I (cTnI) assays have been widely adopted since the
introduction of the third universal definition of myocar￾dial infarction. Our group has contributed to work dem￾onstrating the ability of these assays to define normal
plasma concentrations in healthy populations and to
identify at-risk patients presenting with chest pain and
very small elevations in cTnI concentration that would
pass undetected by older contemporary assays [11]. This
increased sensitivity may have consequences for the
identification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction in
patients undergoing CABG surgery.
Using a comprehensive panel of blood and imaging
biomarkers, we here explored the relationship between
perioperative myocardial inflammation, injury and in￾farction in order to characterise and to diagnose type 5
myocardial infarction with high-sensitivity cTnI assays.
Methods
The Elafin Myocardial Protection from Ischemia Reper￾fusion (EMPIRE, ISRCTN 82061264) randomized
controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of Elafin, a
neutrophil elastase inhibitor, on myocardial injury
during on-pump CABG surgery [12]. This single centre
clinical trial was performed with the approval of the na￾tional research ethics committee (11/MRE00/5), in ac￾cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000), under
a Clinical Trial Authorization (27,586/0015/001–0001)
from the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory
Authority (MHRA, United Kingdom), and the written
informed consent of all participants. The authors had no
conflicts on interests.
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery
The EMPIRE study recruitment, cardiac anesthesia, sur￾gery and protocols have been described previously [12].
Briefly, patients referred for elective CABG surgery were
recruited at Edinburgh Heart Centre between June 2011
and September 2013. Key exclusion criteria included
recent myocardial infarction (within 1 month of sur￾gery), emergency or concomitant valve surgery, signifi￾cant renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration
rate < 40 mL/min), severe respiratory disease, severe left
ventricular impairment (ejection fraction <40%), contra￾indication to magnetic resonance scanning and on-going
treatment for chronic inflammatory disease. Surgical
approach was via a median sternotomy and cardiopul￾monary bypass was started after heparin administration
with a non-pulsatile flow and a membrane oxygenator.
Cardioprotection was provided by cold-blood cardiople￾gia (1:4), which was administered anterogradely, after
cross-clamping the aorta, into the coronary arteries or
by cross clamp fibrillation. Where possible the left in￾ternal mammary artery was used for grafting. Other con￾duits were chosen from saphenous vein, radial artery or
the right internal mammary artery.
Electrocardiogram
An ECG was performed prior to surgery, and then im￾mediately post-surgery, 24 h, 48 h and at discharge.
Additional ECGs were performed only if clinically indi￾cated. Ischemia or infarction by ECG was defined as at
least 2 mm ST deviation in the chest leads or 1 mm in
the limb leads, development of new pathological Q
waves or new bundle branch block. Other ECG categor￾ies included T-wave inversion (TWI) with no signs of
ischemia or infarction, concave ST elevation with or
without PR segment depression and no changes.
Blood biomarkers
Blood samples were taken at baseline (time 0 h, skin in￾cision) and at 2, 6, 24 and 48 h post-operatively. Stored
plasma samples were analysed using the ARCHITECT￾STAT high-sensitive troponin I assay (Abbott Laborator￾ies, Abbott Park, IL) with a limit of detection of 1.2 ng/L
Alam et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017) 12:115 Page 2 of 10

and the inter-assay CV <10% at 4.7 ng/L. The 99th
centile upper reference limit (URL) were 34 ng/L (men)
and 16 ng/L (women) [13]. Plasma concentrations of
high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloper￾oxidase and elastase were quantified using enzyme￾linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs; R&D Systems,
U.K.; Elastase ELISA, Cambridge Biosciences, U.K.).
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging scans were
performed at baseline (up to 6 weeks before surgery)
and as soon as clinically feasible from the fifth post￾operative day. After the post-operative CMR scan,
patients received an intravenous infusion of ultrasmall
superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO; feru￾moxytol, Advanced Magnetics Inc., Cambridge, MA) at
a dose of 4 mg/kg. A third CMR scan was performed
24 h after USPIO infusion. All patients completed scan￾ning within 14 days of surgery. Quantification of left
ventricular mass, ejection fraction and late gadolinium
enhancement infarct size were determined using estab￾lished protocols and dedicated cardiac analysis software
by two trained independent blinded observers. Late
enhancement analysis was performed using QMass
software (Medis medical imaging systems, Netherlands),
allowing quantification of infarct size using the full￾width, half-maximum criterion [12].
Patients were scanned using a 3 T Siemens Verio scan￾ner (Siemens Medical, Germany) as described previously
[12]. USPIO imaging was performed using established
T2*-weighted multi-gradient-echo sequences, with USPIO
images quantitatively analysed using a susceptibility
gradient mapping post-processing technique previously
described [14, 15]. Quantitative analysis of USPIO accu￾mulation was achieved by calculation of T2* relaxation
times before and after administration of USPIO [16]. T2*-
weighted multi-gradient-echo images for the second and
third (post-USPIO) scan were spatially co-registered using
ANALYZE software (AnalyzeDirect Software, United
States). The four echoes from the range (TE = 2.13, 4.27,
6.41, 8.55 ms) in a multi-echo T2*-weighted sequence
were combined to generate a T2* map, using in-house
software developed in Matlab (Mathworks, US) as previ￾ously described [15]. The inverse of T2*, R2*, was then
calculated to assess USPIO uptake and thus a higher R2*
value would indicate a higher level of inflammatory cell
infiltration. The myocardium was divided into the stand￾ard 17-segment model, and a R2* value calculated for each
segment [17]. After calculating the increase in R2* value
between the second and third scans, a pan-myocardial R2*
value calculated from the mean of all segments. Since
inflammation in the myocardium was likely to be non￾uniform, a mean of the highest three segments was also
calculated.
Data and statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad
Prism version 4.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego
California USA). We have previously reported [12] that
Elafin had no effect on all outcome measures assessed
and data from patients receiving placebo and active
treatment arms were therefore aggregated. Plasma hs￾cTnI, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8 and MPO concentrations at
each time point were expressed as median [inter-quartile
range], mean ± standard error of mean or mean (95%
confidence intervals) as appropriate. Forty-eight hour
area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated for plasma
hs-cTnI, hsCRP and cytokines.
The change in mass of infarcted tissue was determined
by the difference in LGE from the preoperative and first
postoperative CMR scans. This was categorized as in￾creased, no change or reduced according to detection
threshold based on inter-observer variability and agreement
between both independent analysers. The absolute change
in ejection fraction from pre to post surgery was calculated
and an arbitrary value of 5% change was used to categorize
patients into increased, decreased or no change.
Categorical data were compared using the Pearson’s
chi-square test. Non-parametric R2* data were analysed
with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Multiple comparisons
for USPIO uptake were compared using Kruskal-Wallis.
If significant, Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test was
performed comparing R2* value across groups. Statistical
significance was defined as two-sided P < 0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics have been reported according to
treatment group previously [12]. Consecutive patients
were assessed for eligibility and 53% consented to par￾ticipate (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Pre-existing (previously un￾identified) myocardial infarction was common with 27%
(21/79 who underwent pre-surgery MRI) of patients hav￾ing pre-operative LGE. Two patients died in the early
post-operative period from graft failure and cardiac
arrest and a further 6 patients were diagnosed with a
myocardial infarction by the clinical team based on ECG
changes and troponin release giving a total of 8 (9%)
patients who were clinically diagnosed with type 5 myo￾cardial infarction. Unrecognised type 5 myocardial in￾farction was identified in a further 10 patients (total of
18; 21%) with new LGE on CMR.
Overall 25.3% of patients required intra-aortic balloon
pump counterpulsation, inotropes or vasoactive support
in the first 48 h, 33% required red cell transfusion, and
31% developed atrial fibrillation prior to discharge
(Table 2).

Humoral and cellular inflammation
Humoral inflammation
Systemic inflammatory markers rose following surgery
(Table 3, Additional file 1: Figure S1) with IL-6 and
MPO peaking at 2 h, and IL-8 and TNF-α continuing to
rise at 6 h. Plasma hsCRP concentrations rose steeply at
6 h and continued to rise at 48 h. There was no correl￾ation between cytokines and LGE on CMR. There was
weak correlation between AUC hsCRP release and hs￾TnI (r = −0.27, p = 0.01).

Cellular inflammation
In total, 54 patients underwent USPIO infusion and
CMR scanning within 14 days of surgery. USPIO infu￾sion was well tolerated, with only 1 patient reporting
muscle cramps after administration. There were 52 pa￾tients with evaluable data for USPIO analysis (Fig. 2)
and these were compared with 10 contemporaneous
healthy volunteers (mean age 26 ± 5 years, 5 male and 5
female) for reference. Previously published data analys￾ing the infarct zone of patients who had experienced
type 1 myocardial infarction are also provided for com￾parison (Fig. 3) [15]. Patients undergoing CABG had
increased pan-myocardial R2* (median 54.8 [interquar￾tile range 43.8 to 68.4] /s versus 41.2 [32.6 to 50.4] /s in
healthy volunteers, p < 0.05). It was also increased in the
highest 3 of the 17 segments (median 80.2 [67.4 to
104.8] /s versus 58.7 [48.8 to 68.6] /s in healthy volun￾teers, p < 0.0001) and was similar to patients who had
sustained type 1 myocardial infarction (109.5 [87.5 to
128.3] /s, p = 0.41). R2* increase correlated with plasma
hsCRP concentrations (Additional file 2: Figure S2; r = 0.3,
p = 0.03) but not with cTnI release (r = 0.15, p = 0.15) or
CPB time (r = 0.00, p = 0.49).
Myocardial injury
Complete cTnI profiles over 48 h were available in 84
patients. Plasma cTnI concentrations peaked at 6 h (me￾dian 3220 [1410 to 5610] ng/L; Fig. 4) with almost all
patients demonstrating >100-fold (median 760 [151 to
1623] fold) increase from baseline to 6 h and all patients
exhibiting >10-fold (median 102 [55 to 206] fold) eleva￾tion above the 99th centile URL. Patients without new
LGE had lower increases (median 83 [11 to 161] fold)
compared to patients with new LGE (median 174 [91 to
248] fold, p = 0.04; Fig. 4).

Two patterns of cTnI release were noted in the post￾operative period with peak concentrations at 6 (n = 67)
or 24 h (n = 18; Fig. 2). Median AUC for hs-cTnI release
was 74,478 [35,100 to 164,100] ng/L/48 h. There was no
correlation between cTnI AUC and cardiopulmonary bypass
(r = 0.14, p = 0.11) or cross clamp time (r = 0.02 p = 0.43).
Myocardial infarction
Electrocardiogram
Eleven (13%) patients developed new ST-change/new
bundle branch block/new Q-waves consistent with myo￾cardial infarction (Fig. 5). The majority of patients had
no ECG changes (n = 41, 48%) or non-specific
pericarditic change (n = 19, 22%) and T wave inversion
(n = 14, 16%). Patients with ECG evidence of infarction
exhibited a cTnI peak at 24 h: 6-h mean, 6124 ng/L
(95% CI 1758 to 10,490) and 24-h mean 23,410 ng/L
(95% CI 8530 to 38,300). Patients without specific ECG
changes of infarction (n = 74) had peak cTnI concentra￾tions at 6 h: 6-h mean 5186 (95% confidence intervals
3635, 6738) ng/L and 24-h mean 1905 (95% confidence
intervals 1353, 2458) ng/L.
Overall, 7/11 (64%) of patients with an ECG suggesting
infarction had a rise in cTnI concentration between 6
and 24 h. In patients with no evidence of infarction on
ECG, only 11/74 (15%) had a rise in cTnI concentration

between 6 and 24 h. Thus ECG analysis provided a posi￾tive predictive value of a late troponin peak of 64% (95%
confidence intervals 31% to 89%) and a negative predict￾ive value of 85% (95% confidence intervals 75% to 92%).
An ECG demonstrating infarction was 23% sensitive and
98% specific for the formation of LGE.
Cardiac magnetic resonance
Assessment of late gadolinium enhancement was avail￾able in 66 of 68 patients who underwent both pre- and
post-operative CMR. Thirteen patients developed new
LGE distributed by ECG category as follows; 3/4 (75%)
with ST-change/new bundle branch block/new Q-waves,
7/35 (20%) with no ECG changes, 3/17 (18%) with peri￾carditic changes and 0/10 (0%) with T wave inversion
(Fig. 5). Infarct volume by LGE correlated with AUC for
cTnI (r = 0.33, p < 0.01). For left ventricular function, 8/
68 (12%) of patients had at least 5% increase in ejection
fraction, 20/68 (29%) had a decrease and 40/68 (59%)
had no change (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Peak plasma cTnI concentration occurred at 24 h in
patients with new LGE: 6-h mean 3655 (95% confidence
intervals 2228 to 5081) ng/L and 24-h mean 9073 (95%
confidence intervals 5106 to 18,660) ng/L. By contrast,
patients without new LGE had a peak cTnI concentra￾tion at 6 h of 5487 (95% confidence intervals 3390 to
7585) ng/L compared to a mean of 1545 (95% confi￾dence intervals 1060 to 2031) ng/L at 24 h. Overall 6/13
(46%) of patients with new LGE had a rise in cTnI con￾centration between 6 and 24 h compared to 5/52 (10%)
in patients without LGE (p < 0.01). A rise in troponin
release after 6 h was 46% sensitive (95% CI 19 to 75)
and 90% specific (95% confidence intervals 79 to 97) for
detecting new LGE. The positive predictive value was
55% (95% confidence intervals 23.38 to 83.25) and the
negative predictive value 87% (95% confidence intervals
75.10 to 94.63).
Discussion
We believe this is the first in depth and detailed investi￾gation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin release and
perioperative myocardial inflammation, injury and in￾farction in patients undergoing CABG surgery. This
study was performed on a highly characterised and phe￾notyped population using the current gold standard
techniques to detect myocardial inflammation, injury
and infarction [11]. We have demonstrated that patients
undergoing CABG surgery invariably have plasma hs￾cTnI concentrations >10-fold the 99th centile that is not
attributable to inflammatory or ischemic injury alone.
Peri-operative type 5 myocardial infarction is often

changes (right). Post-operative evidence of infarction on ECG (bottom)

unrecognised and is associated with a delayed 24-h peak
in plasma hs-cTnI concentrations.
Using the latest generation high-sensitivity assay, we
have shown that cTnI release is >10-fold the upper limit
of normal (99th centile) in all patients following CABG
surgery. Importantly, we describe two patterns of release
with an early 6-h peak and a more delayed 24-h peak.
We suggest these peaks reflect perioperative myocardial
injury and infarction respectively as demonstrated by
late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic res￾onance imaging. There appears to be no single discrim￾inatory threshold for troponin concentration that could
reliably discriminate clinically overt myocardial infarc￾tion. Our data indicate that the profile, rather than peak,
of troponin release may be more important when
attempting to distinguish between myocardial injury and
type 5 myocardial infarction.
All patients in our study exhibited at least 50-fold rise
from baseline troponin and all but 4 had at least 100-
fold increase. Many factors contribute to myocardial in￾jury in the perioperative period including manipulation
of the heart during on-pump surgery, cardioplegia, is￾chemia and patients specific factors including severity of
underlying coronary artery disease and myocardial func￾tion. The average increase in cTnI concentration from
baseline was nearly 2000. The third universal definition
for type 5 myocardial infarction occurring during CABG
surgery stipulates a cardiac marker elevation of ≥10-fold
the upper limit of normal (99th centile). In our study, all
patients undergoing on-pump surgery fulfil this criterion
and this threshold is therefore unhelpful and has no
value. This leads to the questions of whether a higher
single threshold should be employed or whether alterna￾tive criteria looking at the profile of cTnI release may be
more discriminatory.
Our data would not support the approach of increas￾ing the troponin threshold to be more discriminatory.
For example, increasing the threshold to >100-fold 99th
centile would have excluded 64% of patients with LGE
proven macro-infarction and included 43% of patients
without. Our data support the findings by other groups
that multiple time-point sampling to detect a late rise in
troponin concentration is more discriminatory for type 5
myocardial infarction [18–20]. Selvanayagam et al. dem￾onstrated a late peak in troponin levels in patients with
new LGE compared to those without (20.3 ± 11.9 versus
11.3 ± 11.0 h) [18]. Both Pegg et al. and Lim et al. dem￾onstrated that subjects with new LGE showed a trend
for continuous increase of troponin up to 24 h whereas
those without new LGE showed peaks at 6 to 12 h [19, 20].
We have here found two distinct cTnI concentration peaks
at 6 and 24 h. Patients with ECG or LGE evidence of infarc￾tion were much more likely to have a peak cTnI at 24 h
compared to those without. In our study, an ECG
demonstrating infarction was highly specific (98%) for de￾tecting the formation of LGE. However both ECG and cTnI
profile in isolation had relatively low sensitivity for such de￾tection. This may be because greater volume of infarction
must occur in order to cause a change in the electrical or
biochemical profile. We suggest that the most effective and
practical method for diagnosing type 5 myocardial infarc￾tion involves cTnI testing at 6 and 24 h combined with
ECG evidence of infarction. Additional use of CMR is not
practical nor cost effective in the clinical setting. However,
patients with a late rise in cTnI could be targeted for add￾itional diagnostic testing such as echocardiographic im￾aging or angiography. Such patients may also benefit from
additional anti-platelet treatment, but further studies would
be required for validation.
A previous study reported new LGE in up to 78% of
patients undergoing CABG surgery, but the investigators
did not perform pre-operative CMR [21]. We identified
LGE in 27% of pre-operative MRI scans in patients with
no prior clinical history of myocardial infarction suggest￾ing the presence of sub-clinical infarction is common
even in stable patients. Consistent with our work, Pegg
and colleagues also reported new LGE from preoperative
scans in 8/40 (20%) of patients participating in a study
of a novel hybrid method of on-pump beating heart
CABG surgery [19].
Although it might have been anticipated that the mag￾nitude of myocardial injury would correlate with CPB
time, there was no association with AUC cTnI release.
Furthermore there was no correlation with inflammatory
cytokine release or myocardial inflammation. This sug￾gests that injury is not mediated by inflammation alone.
Other processes influence the cTnI injury such as micro￾emboli, surgical manipulation of the heart and patient
specific factors. Our data also confirm that substantial
cTnI release occurs in the perioperative period without
imaging evidence of infarction and new scar formation
consistent with reversible myocardial injury.
We used USPIO contrast for the first time to assess in
vivo myocardial inflammation following CABG surgery,
similar to macrophage infiltration in patients with type 1
myocardial infarction [15]. The average pan-myocardial
USPIO uptake was higher than that of healthy myocar￾dium from controls. However it would be expected that
inflammation would not be uniform throughout the
heart given variation in the distribution and severity of
coronary disease and surgical factors. Using the average
USPIO uptake in the three segments with the highest
uptake, we identified a 2-fold increase compared to the
pan-myocardial values. Macrophage recruitment into the
myocardium correlated weakly with hsCRP suggesting
that humoral and cellular inflammation are co￾ordinated. However there was no correlation with hs￾cTnI or CPB time indicating that the magnitude of
Alam et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017) 12:115 Page 8 of 10

myocardial inflammation was not dependent on degree
of myocardial injury or ischemia time. The determinants
and the sequelae of higher levels of cellular inflamma￾tion post-CABG surgery require further study.
Our study has some limitations. This was a sub￾analysis of the EMPIRE study [12]. In this trial, there
was no demonstrable effect from the intervention (the
neutrophil elastase inhibitor, elafin) on a range of clinical
and surrogate outcome measures. However we cannot
exclude the possibility of a weak effect on the current
outcome measures. Some patients had difficulty lying
flat and breath-holding in the MRI scanner for post￾operative scans. This sometimes resulted in reduced
scan quality. Since the USPIO-enhanced scans were car￾ried out at later time points (5 to 14 days post-surgery),
this may have hindered our ability to identify some of
the correlations with our early (first 48 h) biomarker
assessments.
Conclusions
All patients undergoing CABG surgery demonstrate
>10-fold elevation above the 99th centile of cardiac
troponin indicating the current universal definition of
type 5 myocardial infarction lacks specificity. Differing
levels of myocardial inflammation post CABG surgery
occurred, and did not correlate directly with the length
of CPB, hs-cTnI release or circulating cytokines. A peak
hs-cTnI at 6 h following CABG appears to be related to
the surgical process and non-specific myocardial injury
whilst a continuing increase at 24 h suggesting myocar￾dial infarction. We would suggest cTnI sampling at 6
and 24 h post CABG surgery together with ECG assess￾ment for the routine detection and diagnosis of type 5
myocardial infarction.
