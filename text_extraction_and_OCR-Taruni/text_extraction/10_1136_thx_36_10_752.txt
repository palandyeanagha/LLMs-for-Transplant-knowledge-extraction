ABSTRACT In 175 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (157 chronic bronchitic and 18 em￾physematous patients) exhibiting moderate to severe airway obstruction (mean FEV1/vital capacity
= 40X2 + 11 1 %), cumulative survival rates calculated by the actuarial method were compared in
subgroups according to the initial level of mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary volumes,
and arterial blood gases. Patients were catheterised between 1968 and 1972 and were followed for
at least five years. The results emphasise the high prognostic value of PAP since survival rates after
four and seven years were significantly lower in the subgroup with PAP > 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa).
Certain other parameters ("driving" pressure across_the pulmonary circulation, FEV, and PaCo2)
appear to be equally good at predicting survival as PAP in these obstructed patients. The effect of
age should be taken into account in prognostic studies such as ours since survival rates were sig￾nificantly lower in patients over 60 years of age. In 64 patients who underwent a second right heart
catheterisation at least three years after the first (average delay: 5*5 + 2 years), the prognostic value
of changes in PAP, arterial blood gases, and pulmonary volumes was studied but with the exception
of Pao2 was unremarkable. Further studies are needed in this field.
In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and especially in chronic bronchitis, the presence of
cor pulmonale is associated with a poor prognosis.1-3
However pulmonary arterial hypertension is measur￾able and therefore easier to assess than cor pul￾monale and prognostic studies have usually been
related to the presence of pulmonary hypertension
and its severity.4-7 Most of these studies have in￾cluded cases of severe COPD with a high proportion
of patients having experienced episodes of right￾sided heart failure. Only one recent study7 was
devoted to the prognosis of pulmonary hyper￾tension in a large series of patients with mild or
moderate airflow obstruction. Follow-up data were
generally not taken into account.
We have investigated the prognostic value of mean
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) taking into account
the influence of age, and compared it with other
functional data (FEV1, arterial blood gases) in our
series of patients with moderate to severe airway
obstruction. The actuarial method was used to assess
survival rate. In 64 patients who underwent a second

catheterisation at least three years after the first the
prognostic significance of follow-up data was
evaluated.
Methods
One hundred and seventy-five patients aged between
36 and 82 years (mean 59 8) with chronic bronchitis
or emphysema or both were included in this study.
All but two were male. All patients underwent a
right heart catheterisation between 1968 and 1972.
The fate of all patients at least five years after right
heart catheterisation was known. Dyspnoea on
exertion was present in all cases. Chronic airflow
limitation was assessed by a FEVi/vital capacity
ratio constantly less than 60 %. Cases with associated
left heart disease, systemic hypertension (diastolic
arterial pressure > 100 mmHg, 13-3 kPa), and other
severe disease were excluded. Patients were never
investigated during an acute exacerbation. Twenty￾five patients were excluded from the study having
been lost to follow-up. We do not consider that the
loss of this small number has introduced significant
bias.
Patients could be separated according to clinical,

group (n = 18) but clinical features of chronic
bronchitis (sputum) were sometimes present in
emphysematous patients, as were radiological signs
of emphysema in bronchitic patients.
The following measurements of lung function were
obtained in all patients: vital capacity, FEV1
(measured with a closed circuit spirograph), arterial
blood gases (Pao2, Paco2, pH) measured with
Radiometer electrodes. Haemoglobin saturation was
calculated from Pao2 and pH according to
Severinghaus.10
The procedure for right heart catheterisation used
in our laboratory has been described." Float
catheters were used. Patients were studied in the
supine position in the morning without premedi￾cation. The zero reference point was situated 7-5 cm
below the angle of Louis. Cardiac output was calcu￾lated in steady state conditions (10 to 15 minutes of
quiet breathing) according to the Fick equation. In
64 patients pulmonary haemodynamics were re￾investigated at least three years after the first
measurements (range 36-119 months, mean 67 ± 24
months). At the same time lung function studies
(pulmonary volumes, arterial blood gases) were
repeated.
The fate of patients at least five years after the
initial investigation was known in all cases. The first
catheterisations were performed in 1968 and data
were collected in 1978; thus the period of observation
varied from a few months (early deaths) to 10 years.
The survival rate was calculated according to the
actuarial method.12 The advantage of this method is
that it takes into account patients who might be lost
after five years of observation. Its value in this kind
of study has been emphasised recently by Massin et
al.7 Survival rates of subgroups (separated according
to PAP, FEV1, arterial blood gases, and so on) could

The average figures for the main parameters in
patients not surviving five years and in survivors were
compared using Student's t test for unpaired data.
In patients who underwent a second right heart
catheterisation, the average values of haemodynamic
measurements, pulmonary volumes, and arterial
blood gases between the first and the second investi￾gation were compared by Student's t test for paired
data. These patients were divided into two sub￾groups: dead patients and survivors of seven years
or longer, and rates of change in FAP, PaO2, PaCO2,
vital capacity, and FEV1 between these two sub￾groups were compared (Student's t test).
Results
Average values for pulmonary volumes, arterial
blood gases, and pulmonary haemodynamics are
listed in table l. Airway obstruction was moderate
to severe and the mean FEVi/vital capacity ratio for
the whole group was markedly abnormal (40-2 ±
11 1%). Hypoxaemia was observed in almost all
cases but was generally moderate (Pao2 < 60 mm Hg,

8 kPa in 71 cases, 40 6 %). Hypercapnia defined by a
PaCo2 > 45 mmHg (6 kPa) was present in only 42
subjects (24 %).
Pulmonary arterial hypertension was defined as
PAP > 20 mmHg (2-7 kPa) and was observed in 62
patients (35 4%). In only 17 cases (9.7%) was PAP >
30 mmHg (4 kPa). The pulmonary capillary (wedge)
pressure was normal (< 12 mmHg, 1 6 kPa) in all
but four cases. The driving pressure across the
pulmonary circulation was defined as the difference
between PAP and the pulmonary capillary pressure.
The survival rate of the whole group was compared
to that of a general population with a comparable
age distribution and with the same mean age (60
years).13 The survival rate was strikingly lower in
our group of patients after three years: 73 8 % versus
96% in the general population. After five years the
survival rate was 56-6 % versus 92%. After eight
years it was only 40-6% versus 86%. At the end of
the study 99 subjects had died. Death was directly
or indirectly related to cardiorespiratory causes in
56 cases. In 20 cases, it was due to other causes. In
23 cases the exact cause of death was not known.
Survival rates were calculated according to the
initial level of PAP (> 20 mmHg, 2-7 kPa, n = 62,
< 20 mmHg, n = 113), Pao2 (< 60 mmHg, 8 kPa,
n = 71, > 60mmHg,n = 104), PaCo2(> 45 mmHg,
6 kPa, n = 42, < 45 mmHg, n = 133), FEV1
(< 1200 ml, n = 85, > 1200 ml,n = 90), driving
pressure (> 15 mmHg, 2 kPa, n = 34, < 15 mmHg,
n = 71). The influence of age on survival rates was
also investigated ( > 60 years, n = 94, < 60 years,
n = 81). It would have been preferable to divide
each range into more than two groups, especially the
age range which is very large (36-83 yr). This was not
done because the actuarial method is invalid when
groups are numerically small. The division into two
groups for each parameter was either arbitrary in

order to have groups with comparable numbers of
patients or was based on the usual criteria of "nor￾mality" for example, PAP > 20 mmHg (2 7 kPa) =
pulmonary hypertension, Paco2 > 45 mmHg (6
kPa) = hypercapnia and so on.
Table 2 displays survival rates after four and
seven years and the statistical significance of the
comparison between subgroups. Survival rate curves
according to PAP, FEV1, and age are illustrated by
figs 1-3 (other curves (Pao2, Paco2, driving pressure,
survival rate curve for the whole group) may be
obtained from the authors on request). It may be
seen that survival rates differ significantly according
to the initial level of all the above-mentioned para￾meters except for Pao2 after seven years. The largest
differences between subgroups were observed for
Paco2, FEV1, and driving pressure.
Average values of the main parameters in the
group of subjects who died within five years (n = 76)
and the group of survivors (n = 99) were compared
by Student's t test. Table 3 shows that more effective
discrimination between the two groups was provided
by FEV1, age, and driving pressure.
In 64 patients who underwent a second right
heart catheterisation at least three years after the first,
we compared initial and final pulmonary haemodyna￾mic measurements, pulmonary volumes and arterial
blood gases. These results are presented in table 4.
This subgroup of 64 patients is fairly representative
of the whole group (except for age: 56-7 + 7-7 years)
since initial mean values are very close in the whole
group (table 1) and in this subgroup (table 4).
During the observation period pulmonary volumes
decreased significantly, Pao2 and Paco2 both in￾creased and changes in PAP were small although
statistically significant.
The fate of 51 patients who underwent a second
right heart catheterisation was known seven years
after the initial investigation. These patients were
divided into two subgroups: subjects who died
within seven years (n = 24) and subjects who sur￾vived seven years or more (n = 27). Changes in
PAP, arterial blood gases, and pulmonary volumes
in these two subgroups were compared and the re￾sults are shown in table 5. Mean changes were not
significantly different, except for Pao2 which in￾creased in the group of survivors but did not vary
appreciably in the group of patients who died within
seven years.
Discussion
In patients with moderate to severe airway obstruc￾tion the prognosis was significantly worse when
pulmonary hypertension was present. Patients with￾out initial pulmonary hypertension had a survival
rate of 71 8% after four years compared with a
survival rate of 49.4% in patients with initial pul￾monary hypertension. After seven years the differ￾ences were also very marked, there being 5566% of
survivors in the group without pulmonary hyper￾tension compared with 29.20% in the group with
pulmonary hypertension. The prognostic significance
of PAP is also illustrated by the comparison of the
average PAP in survivors after five years and in
patients who died within five years (table 3), but it
should be emphasised that overlap of individual
values between groups was important. Thus the
prognostic value of pulmonary hypertension in
COPD patients agrees fairly well with the results of
previous investigators.4 -7 14 Ourednik et al4 observed
that survival rates were significantly different after
three and five years when PAP was greater or less
than 20 mmHg (2 7 kPa) and when PAP was > 40
mmHg (5 4 kPa) survival rate was lower than in
patients with a PAP 20-40 mmHg (2 7-5-4 kPa), as
early as one or two years after the first examination.
In most previous studies subjects have been div￾ided, according to the level of PAP, into three,7
four,15 or five groups.6 14 Thus pulmonary hyper￾tension can be classified as mild (20-30 mmHg,
2 7-4 kPa), moderate (30-40 mmHg, 4-54 kPa) or
severe (> 40 mmHg, 5.4 kPa) and survival rates
clearly show that prognosis is particularly bad when
PAP is > 30 mmHg (4 kPa).6 715 For instance
Ourednik and Susa6 observed that in their subgroup
with PAP > 50 mmHg (6 6 kPa) all patients had died
within five years and that in the subgroup 30-50
mmHg (4-6 6 kPa) only 30 % had survived after five
years compared with 500% in the subgroup 20-30
mmHg (2 7-4 kPa). Conversely Bishop15 ob￾served that when PAP was initially normal, 900% of
subjects were alive five years later and Massin et at7
had very similar results for patients in whom PAP
was < 20 mmHg (2 7 kPa). We have divided our
patients into only two subgroups because although
pulmonary hypertension was present in 62 subjects,
it was moderate to severe (> 30 mmHg, 4 kPa) in
only 17 subjects, the actuarial method would have
been invalid for a group of this size.
Of the other haemodynamic parameters only
driving pressure (PAP-wedge pressure) had a signifi￾cant influence on survival rate, a finding which is in
agreement with the results of others who have
studied survival rate according to pulmonary vascu￾lar resistance.7 15 We found that levels of cardiac
output and wedge pressure did not influence prog￾nosis. Massin et al7 have recently investigated the
prognostic value of more sophisticated haemo￾dynamic parameters and have found that PAP-end￾diastolic right ventricle pressure and change in PAP
from rest to exercise were as good predictors of
mortality as PAP.

Prognostic value ofpulmonary artery pressure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
In our patients with chronic bronchitis and em￾physema, FEVI and Paco2 seem to be as good at
predicting survival as PAP. Tables 2 and 3 show that
the most significant differences were found when
survival rates were compared in relation to initial
FEV1 and that the best discrimination between
survivors after five years and patients who died
within five years was provided by FEV1. The high
prognostic value of FEV1 in patients with COPD is
well known16-21 and has been recently emphasised
by Traver et al.3
The influence of age should be taken into account
in this kind of prognostic study.3 We observed that
prognosis was significantly worse in patients > 60
years. The influence of age appears to be independent
of functional and haemodynamic impairment. Mean
values of PAP, driving pressure, Pao2, and Paco2
were almost identical in patients above and below
60 years, the only difference found being for FEV1
which was lower in patients aged over 60 years (1130
+ 375 ml versus 1350 ± 530 ml in patients of under
60 years, p < 0 05). As the effect of age on prognosis
is significant it would have been justified, when
studying the influence of haemodynamic and func￾tional parameters, to further subdivide all groups
according to age. This has not been done because
the actuarial method of statistical analysis used in
this study is inapplicable to small groups. The in￾fluence of age may partly account for the published
differences observed between authors. Thus in the
study of Massin et al,7 survival rates for the whole
group after five years (746 %) and 10 years (51 1 %)
were markedly higher than our finding of 56-6 % after
five years and 38-4 % after nine years. However
Massin et al excluded patients over 65 years and the
mean age of their group was 53-8 years.
Sixty-four patients underwent a second right heart
catheterisation at least three years after the first, and
we attempted to assess the prognostic value of
follow-up data in addition to that of the initial
"static" data. This group of patients was very similar
to the whole group in terms of mean functional and
haemodynamic data. In these patients changes in
pulmonary haemodynamics were unremarkable, in
agreement with recently published follow-up
studies,22-24 whereas pulmonary volumes had de￾creased markedly. Although survival rates in relation
to changes in PAP, arterial blood gases, and pul￾monary volumes could not be compared because of
the limited number of cases, we did compare changes
in these parameters in the survivors and the group
of patients who died within seven years, using
Student's t test. Decline of vital capacity and FEV1
and increase of PAP were generally more important
in the group of patients who died but the differences
were small. The only significant difference was re￾lated to change in Pao2. It is probable that some
differences would have become statistically significant
had the number of patients been greater in each
group. Some bias may have been introduced by the
loss from follow-up of patients who died within the
first three years. Further studies are needed to evalu￾ate the prognostic significance of changes in pul￾monary haemodynamics in patients with chronic
obstructive lung disease.
