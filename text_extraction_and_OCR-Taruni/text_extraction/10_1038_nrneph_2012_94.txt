RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
Estimates of glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) are central to the staging of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
for the prediction of risk associated with 
impaired renal function. Most laboratories 
estimate GFR using the Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study 
equation—an equation first proposed 
in 1999. New findings from the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, 
however, show that the more recently 
published Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD–EPI) 
equation categorizes the risk of mortality 
and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) more 
accurately than does the MDRD Study 
equation in a broad range of populations. 
“Our report with data from 1 million 
individuals from 40 countries shows that 
the CKD–EPI equation classifies risk 
better than the MDRD Study equation 
across diverse groups of people in terms 
of age, sex, race, world religions, and 
clinical characteristics, with impressive 
consistency”, says principal investigator 
of the Consortium, Josef Coresh. “Thus, 
we plan to use the CKD–EPI equation 
for GFR estimation in both clinical 
applications and research studies and we 
think many others will as well”.
The CKD–EPI equation, which was 
first derived in 2009, uses the same four 
variables as the MDRD Study equation 
to estimate kidney function, but has been 
shown by several studies to be superior to 
the MDRD Study equation for predicting 
risk of adverse events associated with 
reduced renal function. As Andrew Levey, 
the senior author of the Consortium 
study explains, “the published studies 
were predominantly based on data from 
white individuals with preserved kidney 
function, leaving uncertainties about the 
ability to generalize these findings to other 
groups of individuals in terms of race, 
ethnicity and clinical characteristics”.
To compare the associations of GFR 
estimates using the CKD–EPI equation 
and MDRD Study equation with outcomes 
in a broad population, the researchers 
performed a meta-analysis of data from 
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
The CKD–EPI equation—accurately stratifying risk in CKD
1.1 million adults from 45 cohorts (25 
general population cohorts, 7 cohorts 
at high risk of cardiovascular or kidney 
disease, and 13 CKD cohorts). “Given 
that GFR category is a central measure 
for CKD definition and staging, our 
comparison was focused on GFR estimates 
broken into six categories, corresponding 
to various stages of kidney disease”, 
explains lead author, Kunihiro Matsushita. 
The researchers assessed the proportion 
of individuals who were reclassified using 
the CKD–EPI equation rather than the 
MDRD Study equation and investigated 
whether reclassification was concordant 
with future risk of adverse outcomes. 
“This methodology directly shows 
whether physicians’ use of GFR categories 
in assessing risk will be improved by 
switching equations,” says Matsushita.
The researchers found that the newer 
CKD–EPI equation consistently classified 
future risk better than the older MDRD 
Study equation. Compared with the 
MDRD Study equation, use of the CKD–
EPI equation reclassified 24.4% and 0.6% 
of individuals in the general population 
cohorts to higher and lower GFR 
categories, respectively. The researchers 
observed similar reclassification among 
individuals from the high-risk cohorts 
(15.4% upwards and 1.2% downwards), 
but less upward and more downward 
reclassification among individuals 
from the CKD cohorts (6.6% and 3.2%, 
respectively). Approximately one-third 
of participants with mild to moderate 
kidney disease (estimated GFR 30–89ml/
min/1.73m2
) as classified using the 
MDRD Study equation were found to have 
a higher estimated GFR when the CKD–
EPI equation was used, resulting in a lower 
prevalence of CKD. These individuals also 
had a 1.3–2.0-fold lower risk of dying or 
developing ESRD, even after adjustment 
for potential cofounders. 
Subgroup analyses revealed that the 
CKD–EPI equation predicted clinical risk 
more accurately than did the MDRD Study 
equation in older and Asian individuals 
and performed at least as well for 
predicting risk in black individuals.
On the basis of their findings, the 
researchers recommend that more 
laboratories adopt the CKD–EPI 
equation to estimate kidney function. 
Given that the CKD–EPI equation uses 
the same variables as the MDRD Study 
equation to estimate GFR, they believe 
that implementation of the CKD–EPI 
equation would contribute to better and 
more targeted allocation of health care 
for CKD management without additional 
laboratory costs. “The totality of evidence 
now strongly favors the CKD–EPI 
equation for providing improvement in 
both validity of GFR estimation and risk 
prediction. As of 2011, 4% of laboratories 
that report GFR along with serum 
creatinine level had switched to the new 
equation ... our data should accelerate this 
trend”, Coresh concludes.
