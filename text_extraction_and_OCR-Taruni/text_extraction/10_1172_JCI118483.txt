Abstract
CTLA4Ig, a fusion protein that blocks CD28-B7 costimula￾tion, was studied in a LEW to F344 rat model of chronic
cardiac rejection. In rats treated with a single dose of
CTLA4Ig (0.5 mg intraperitoneally) 2 d after transplanta￾tion, allografts survived significantly longer (. 70 d in 64%)
than in untreated controls or rats treated with control Ig (all
rejected within 25 d). Only 25% of grafts from rats treated
with a single, high dose of cyclosporine A (25 mg/kg, 2 d af￾ter transplantation) survived longer than 70 d. Reverse
transcriptase PCR and immunostaining analyses of tissue
from 75-d, CTLA4Ig-treated allografts showed reduced ex￾pression of the T cell factor IFN-g and macrophage activa￾tion factors monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, inducible
nitric oxide synthase, and galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine
macrophage lectin, as well as TGF-b. Grafts from long￾term survivors (. 120 d) treated with CTLA4Ig showed sig￾nificant reductions in the frequency and severity of arterio￾sclerosis in comparison with cyclosporine A–treated rats.
Thus, T cell activation is a proximal event in the cascade
that culminates in the arteriosclerosis of chronic rejection.
Strategies for blocking T cell costimulation may help pre￾vent chronic rejection in clinical transplantation. (J. Clin.

Introduction
With advances in the control of acute rejection, chronic rejec￾tion manifested by arteriosclerosis of donor vessels has be￾come one of the leading obstacles to long-term survival after
solid organ transplantation (1, 2). The classic feature of trans￾plant arteriosclerosis is a vasculopathy characterized by accel￾erated fibrointimal thickening of most graft vessels (3, 4). Al￾though the precise molecular and cellular events that regulate
chronic rejection (and acute rejection) are not yet elucidated, a
number of alloantigen-dependent and -independent factors
have been implicated (2).
The LEW to F344 rat heterotopic abdominal cardiac trans￾plantation model has been used extensively to study chronic
allograft rejection and graft arteriosclerosis (5, 6). Chronically
rejecting rat allografts develop moderate lymphocyte and mac￾rophage infiltration within the interstitium and perivascular
space in association with arteriosclerotic lesions (7, 8). The
earliest vascular lesion (days 7–14) involves the adhesion of
monocytes/macrophages to the vessel wall (8). Between day 28
and day 75 the intima thickens, primarily because of macro￾phage accumulation interposed with smooth muscle cells. The
last phase involves myointimal thickening with smooth muscle
cell accumulation and fewer mononuclear cells.
Because of the early and sustained presence of T cells and
macrophages, we have studied T cell and macrophage activa￾tion in the LEW to F344 rat model. Intragraft levels of IFN-g,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1),1
 inducible ni￾tric oxide synthase (iNOS), galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine
(Gal/GalNAc) macrophage lectin, and endothelin-1 (9–12) are
all increased, and are believed to contribute to development of
graft arteriosclerosis.
The interaction of CD28 on T cells with its ligands (B7-1
and B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells is an important costimu￾latory pathway mediating the response to alloantigens (13, 14).
CTLA4Ig is a recombinant fusion protein that contains the ex￾tracellular domain of human CTLA4 (a homologue of CD28)
fused to a human IgG1 heavy chain (15). CTLA4Ig prevents
acute rejection and induces donor-specific tolerance in a num￾ber of rodent transplantation models (14–17). However, there
have been no studies of the effect that blocking T cell costimu￾lation has on development of chronic rejection. Here we stud￾ied the effect of blocking the CD28-B7 costimulatory T cell ac￾tivation pathway by examining alterations in graft survival, T
cell and macrophage activation, and arteriosclerotic lesion de￾velopment in the LEW to F344 rat model of chronic rejection.

scribed (18). LEW rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN)
were used as donors. F344 rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley) were used
as recipients in the allogeneic combination to produce chronic rejec￾tion. LEW rats were used in the isogeneic combination to produce
control hearts exposed to the same surgical procedure but free of vas￾cular abnormalities. Rejection was defined as the complete cessation
of palpable heart beat (19).
Treatment protocols. CTLA4Ig and control human Ig were gen￾erously provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Seattle, WA). Based on
survival data from Sayegh et al. (16) and Lin et al. (17) showing long￾term graft survival, one group (n 5 13) was given CTLA4Ig as a sin￾gle intraperitoneal injection 2 d after transplantation. The three refer￾ence groups included (a) untreated recipients (n 5 6); (b) recipients
treated with control human Ig given as a single dose on day 2 (0.5 in￾traperitoneally) (n 5 4); and (c) animals treated with cyclosporine A
(25 mg/kg intraperitoneally on day 2) (n 5 9). For reverse tran￾scriptase PCR analysis, surviving cardiac allografts were harvested af￾ter 70–75 d, which coincides with points demonstrated in previous
studies to correspond to elevated transcript levels in LEW to F344
cardiac allografts for the various factors analyzed here (11). Serial
midventricular sections were frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent
RNA extraction and immunohistochemical analysis. For morphomet￾ric analysis of arteriosclerotic lesion development, we harvested a
group of grafts after 100 d, a point at which myointimal thickening
had been observed to be maximal in long-term survivors (5). To ob￾tain a significant number of animals with allografts surviving long
term, we generated a separate group of F344 recipients (n 5 12)
treated with daily subcutaneous injections of cyclosporine A (5 mg/
kg) for 30 d starting on the day of transplantation and harvested for
arteriosclerotic lesion analysis after 100 d. Morphometric scores from
the long-term surviving grafts (n 5 7) were compared with those from
a group of allografts from recipients treated with CTLA4Ig (n 5 5) as
well as LEW to LEW cardiac isografts (n 5 5) harvested at 120 d.
Measurement of gene transcript levels. To evaluate the effects of
CTLA4Ig treatment on lymphocyte and macrophage activation, we
measured gene transcript levels for factors we have previously shown
(with the exception of TGF-b) to be upregulated in 75-d cardiac al￾lografts. Relative gene transcript levels were measured by reverse
transcriptase PCR assays which are sensitive, require only 2.5 mg of
total RNA, and permit replicates to be performed from a single
cDNA. Primers and reverse transcriptase PCR conditions (including
the logarithmic ranges for cycle number and template dilutions), an￾nealing temperatures, and cycle number for each of the various fac￾tors had been optimized already (9–11). The assay for TGF-b was set
up similarly, with optimization of the PCR reaction, confirmation of
the identity of the product by sequence analysis, and establishment of
the logarithmic assay range. The primer sequences used for amplifica￾tion of TGF-b-1 were 59 TGA ACC AAG GAG ACG GAA TAC
AGG and 39 TAC TGT GTG TCC AGG CTC CAA ATG generat￾ing a single PCR product band of 385 bp at an annealing temperature
of 578C for 24 cycles (20).
To identify relative differences, we derived corrected transcript
levels from sets of cDNAs (studied simultaneously) that included
negative controls (for which reverse transcriptase had been omitted
during cDNA synthesis or for which water had been used instead of
cDNA). The 9 cDNAs (experimental set) analyzed were prepared
from 75-d cardiac allografts treated in various subgroups with (a) a
single dose of CTLA4Ig (n 5 3), (b) a single dose of cyclosporine A
(n 5 3), and (c) 75-d LEW cardiac isografts (n 5 3). Each PCR analy￾sis was completed in quadruplicate. The mean value for the corrected
levels was obtained by pooling measurements from all animals in a
subgroup. Results for each analysis were subjected to multivariate
ANOVA without replication. If variance was significant, individual
comparisons were made and the level of significance was corrected by
the Bonferonni method (11).
Immunocytochemistry. Leukocyte populations and expression
levels of various gene products were evaluated in serial cryostat sec￾tions by immunoperoxidase labeling (peroxidase-antiperoxidase tech￾nique) (10, 16). This analysis included the use of mouse mAbs to rat
mononuclear phagocytes (ED-1; Accurate Chemicals, Westbury,
NY) and IFN-g (DB-10; Dr. P. van der Meide, Rijswijk, Holland) and
polyclonal rabbit antibodies to iNOS (Transduction Laboratories,
Lexington, KY), TGF-b (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and
MCP-1 (Dr. Barrett Rollins, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston,
MA).
Morphometric analysis. Sagittal sections of cardiac allografts
stained with Verhoeff’s elastin were compared by using the 0–5 grad￾ing system described by Adams et al. (5). In brief, a score of 0 indi￾cated a normal vessel, 3 implied 20–50% luminal occlusion, and a
score of 5 implied . 80% luminal occlusion. For a more quantitative
assessment, the actual percent luminal occlusion for each vessel was
determined using NIH-Image (version 1.51) on a Macintosh Centris
650 to trace the internal elastic lamina and the lumen in each vessel
from transmitted light images of elastin-stained sections. Percent lu￾minal occlusion was calculated using: (area within the internal elastic
lamina 2 area of the lumen)/(area within the internal elastic lamina)
3 100. Mean values for the vessel scores, percentage of diseased ves￾sels, and percent luminal occlusion were then derived by pooling all
of the vessels analyzed per graft. A total of 268 vessels were analyzed
with an average of 15.7 scored per graft. Mean scores were pooled for
all grafts in each group and subjected to multivariate ANOVA as de￾scribed above.
Results
Cardiac allograft survival. LEW heart allografts (Table I)
were rejected by week 4 after transplantation in the three con￾trol groups of F344 recipients: untreated, single dose of control
Ig on day 2, and single dose of cyclosporine A. Administration
of CTLA4Ig 2 d after engraftment resulted in a prolongation
of graft survival, with 64% of the allografts surviving longer
than 70 d (palpable cardiac impulses were similar to those in
isografts). In contrast, in only 22% of the animals that received
a relatively high dose of cyclosporine A (25 mg/kg 2 d after
transplantation) was graft survival prolonged beyond 70 d. As
expected, subcutaneous injection of cyclosporine A (5 mg/kg)
daily for 1 mo improved allograft survival, with 58% of the
grafts surviving longer than 100 d.
Inflammatory cell activation patterns. To study the effect
of CD28-B7 blockade on inflammatory cell activation in the
target organ, we measured relative gene transcript levels in
75-d cardiac allografts with reverse transcriptase PCR assays
optimized for CD4, IFN-g, TGF-b, iNOS, MCP-1, and Gal/
GalNAc macrophage lectin. For all six factors, transcript levels
were significantly higher in cardiac allografts from animals that
received cyclosporine A and survived longer than 70 d (P ,
0.001) than in the age-matched isografts (Fig. 1). As we ob￾served for the previously studied factors, TGF-b transcript lev￾els were higher in allografts (by day 7 and through day 90)
than in isografts or host hearts (data not shown). These find￾ings are consistent with reports of increased TGF-b transcript
levels in rat aortic allografts and in human endomyocardial bi￾opsy samples (21, 22). In contrast, in the cardiac allografts
from recipients treated with CTLA4Ig, transcript levels were
significantly lower for most factors studied in comparison with
levels in the group receiving cyclosporine A (Figs. 1 and 2).
Specifically, CTLA4Ig treatment was associated with reduced
gene transcript levels for the cell surface marker CD4. As
might be expected, this reduction correlated with a decrease in
mononuclear cell infiltration apparent on histologic examina￾tion of tissue from the CTLA4Ig group in comparison with
that from the cyclosporine A group. There was also a signifi-

cant reduction in gene transcript levels for the T cell activation
cytokine IFN-g, macrophage activation markers (iNOS and
Gal/GalNAc macrophage lectin), and TGF-b in the group re￾ceiving CTLA4Ig in comparison with the cyclosporine A
group (P , 0.007). The increase in MCP-1 gene transcript lev￾els was not affected significantly by single-dose CTLA4Ig
treatment, suggesting that MCP-1 may not be regulated at the
transcriptional level or that it may be regulated by factors
other than those in the CD28-B7 cascade.
Immunocytochemical analysis. The extent to which in￾creased levels of gene transcripts resulted in corresponding ex￾pression of gene products was determined by immunoperoxi￾dase labeling (Fig. 2). The 75-d allografts from recipients
treated with a single dose of cyclosporine A showed marked
mononuclear cell infiltration involving many ED-1–positive
macrophages (Fig. 2 b) associated with patchy fibrosis in the
myocardium and perivascular space. Intimal thickening typical
of chronic rejection was present in the group of allografts from
recipients treated with cyclosporine A (two vessels in b). In the
smaller vessel (left) the lumen was almost completely obliter￾ated, whereas in the larger vessel the neointima had expanded
(asterisk). Mononuclear cell infiltration was associated with
striking staining for IFN-g, MCP-1, and iNOS (Fig. 2 a, c, and
d). Also, for iNOS some smooth muscle cells in some vessel
subsets were also positive, as we have observed elsewhere in
control allografts (11). Finally, in the cyclosporine A group
(Fig. 2 e) there was dense staining for TGF-b associated with
mononuclear and neointimal cells and matrix. In contrast, in
75-d cardiac allografts from recipients treated with CTLA4Ig
there were far fewer cells staining positive and a decrease in
the intensity of staining for all five factors (Fig. 2, f–j). Of the
inflammatory cell factors studied, staining for MCP-1 was still
intense, in spite of the clear reduction in level in comparison
with the cyclosporine A–treated group. One possible explana￾tion for the discordance between the levels of MCP-1 tran￾scripts (which were not significantly lower) and those of the
MCP-1 gene product (which were reduced in the CTLA4Ig￾treated allografts) is that small decreases might not be identi￾fied in the reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Alternatively,
MCP-1 may be regulated at the translational level in these al￾lografts.
Morphometric analysis. LEW to F344 cardiac allografts
older than 100 d showed more advanced and frequent arterio￾sclerotic lesions after cyclosporine A treatment compared with
the group that received CTLA4Ig or isografts. Fig. 3 depicts
representative vessels from the isograft group without intimal
thickening (A), from the cyclosporine A–treated group (B)
with neointimal thickening obliterating the lumen, and from
the CTLA4Ig-treated group (C) with markedly reduced thick￾ening. In the cyclosporine A–treated group, the measured per￾cent luminal occlusion, mean intimal thickening score, and
number of affected vessels were significantly higher than in
vessels from the allografts treated with CTLA4Ig or isografts
(P , 0.0003)(Table II). Thus, a single dose of CTLA4Ig deliv￾ered on day 2 after transplantation affected both late inflam￾matory cell activation and arteriosclerotic development.

jection of CTLA4Ig 2 d after transplantation increased cardiac
allograft survival, decreased graft mononuclear cell infiltra￾tion, and significantly reduced gene transcript and product lev￾els for key T cell and macrophage activation markers in the
LEW to F344 rat model of chronic rejection. Our observations
in 75-d allografts indicate that effector cascades associated
with both T cell and macrophage activation were disrupted by
early administration of CTLA4Ig. Furthermore, our data show
that early CD28-B7 blockade attenuates arteriosclerotic devel￾opment, the sine qua non of chronic rejection, reducing both
its severity and the percentage of diseased vessels. Hence,
these findings provide clear support for the widely held hy￾pothesis that T cell recognition of alloantigen and activation
are critical and proximal events in the complex cellular and
molecular processes leading to chronic rejection.
We (16) and others (17, 23, 24) have shown previously that
CD28-B7 blockade by CTLA4Ig prevents acute rejection and
induces donor-specific tolerance in several experimental mod￾els. The data presented here are the first to demonstrate that
blocking this costimulatory T cell activation pathway prevents
chronic rejection. Of interest are our observations that rela￾tively high doses of cyclosporine A administered in a protocol
similar to that for CTLA4Ig were ineffective in prolonging al￾lograft survival and that they had little effect on development
of chronic rejection. This is not surprising given that humans
receive chronic cyclosporine A therapy and still develop trans￾plant arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, although prolonged daily
administration of maintenance doses of cyclosporine A was ef￾fective in prolonging allograft survival to a degree similar to
that seen with a single injection of CTLA4Ig, cyclosporine A
did not prevent development of chronic rejection at this dose.
Therefore our data underscore the importance of making de￾tailed examinations of allografts when examining strategies for
prolonging graft survival, since survival data alone may not re￾flect the degree of ongoing chronic rejection. Our observations
also emphasize that therapies targeted to induction of toler￾ance rather than immunosuppression may be essential in the
development of novel strategies for preventing chronic rejec￾tion (25, 26).
One of the known consequences of CD28-B7 signaling is
the regulation of cytokine production by T cells (13, 27). Little
is known, however, about the effects of the CD28-B7 costimu￾latory pathway on macrophage activation. In this report, we
show that early blockade of CD28-B7 also disrupts increases in
gene transcript levels (Gal/GalNAc macrophage lectin and
iNOS) associated with macrophage activation in 75-d cardiac
allografts. For those factors whose expression levels were re￾duced, this might have been caused by a direct inhibition of
macrophages through the B7 axis or, more likely, by an indi￾rect effect related to a decrease in levels of T cell cytokines
(such as IFN-g) required for induction of macrophage expres￾sion. In LEW to F344 rat cardiac allografts, we have shown
previously that upregulation of T cell factors such as IFN-g
and IL-6 occurs in concert with that of macrophage activation
factors (MCP-1, iNOS, Gal/GalNAc macrophage lectin, and
allograft inflammatory factor-1). Gene transcript levels in￾crease early in allografts (by day 7) and remain persistently el￾evated (through day 75 at least), and they are low in age￾Figure 2.

In the cyclosporine A–treated group, consecutive sections show perivascular, ad￾ventitial, and occasional intimal and interstitial mononuclear cells and an expanded neointima (to immediate right of asterisk in muscular artery

fewer macrophages (g), and greatly reduced labeling for MCP-1, iNOS, and TGF-b (h–j). (Cryostat sections, counterstained with hematoxylin

matched isografts. The sustained expression of these activation
factors is in keeping with a chronic alloimmune response, it oc￾curs in concert with development of arteriosclerotic lesions,
and it is modulated by other strategies that reduce arterioscle￾rosis (11).
These studies in the LEW to F344 rat model of chronic car￾diac rejection show that CTLA4Ig blockade of the CD28-B7
costimulatory T cell activation pathway modulates the state of
chronic inflammatory activation in both T cells and macro￾phages in allografts. More importantly, our findings demon￾strate that CTLA4Ig, in addition to protecting against acute
rejection, protects against the arteriosclerotic sequelae of
chronic rejection. These observations should have important
implications for clinical transplantation, as studies of CTLA4Ig
are being planned in humans.
