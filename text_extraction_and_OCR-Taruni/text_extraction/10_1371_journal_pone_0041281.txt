Abstract
Cardiovascular death commonly occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease. Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, has been
demonstrated in vitro as a contributory factor in cardiac fibrosis, a typical pathological finding in uremic cardiomyopathy.
This study aimed to determine if cardiac fibrosis is reversible by lowering serum IS levels using an oral charcoal adsorbent,
AST-120. Subtotal-nephrectomized (5/6-STNx) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either AST-120 (AST-120,
n = 13) or no treatment (vehicle, n = 17) for 12 weeks. Sham operated rats (n = 12) were used as controls. Early left ventricular
(LV) diastolic dysfunction was demonstrated by an increase in peak velocity of atrial filling [A and A’ waves] and a decrease
of E/A and E’/A’ ratios obtained by echocardiography. This was accompanied by a 4.5-fold increase in serum IS (p,0.001) as
well as elevated tail-cuff blood pressure (p,0.001) and heart weight (p,0.001). Increased LV fibrosis (p,0.001), gene
expression of pro-fibrotic (TGF-b, CTGF) and hypertrophic (ANP, b-MHC and a-skeletal muscle actin) markers, as well as TGF￾b and phosphorylated NF-kB protein expression were observed in STNx + vehicle rats. Treatment with AST-120 reduced
serum creatinine (by 54%, p,0.05) and urine total protein (by 27%, p,0.05) vs vehicle whilst having no effect on blood
pressure (AST-120 = 227611 vs vehicle = 22468 mmHg, ns) and heart weight. The increase in serum IS was prevented with
AST-120 (by 100%, p,0.001) which was accompanied by reduced LV fibrosis (68%, p,0.01) and TGF-b and phosphorylated
NF-kB protein expression (back to sham levels, p,0.05) despite no significant change in LV function. In conclusion, STNx
resulted in increased cardiac fibrosis and circulating IS levels. Reduction of IS with AST-120 normalizes cardiac fibrosis, in a
blood pressure independent manner.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major contributor to
cardiovascular (CV) mortality which is responsible for 40–50%
of all deaths in such patients. [1] Death from cardiac causes is
greater in dialyzed uremic patients by a factor of approximately
10–30 compared to the rates in the respective background
population. [2].
Studies on cardiac pathology in CKD have previously
demonstrated typical structural changes, ‘‘uremic cardiomyopa￾thy’’, comprising fibrosis, hypertrophy and a reduction in capillary
supply per unit volume of cardiac tissue. [3] Renal fibrosis is also a
key characteristic finding in progressive CKD, irrespective of the
nature of the initial renal insult.
A variety of mechanisms contributing to uremic cardiomyop￾athy have been proposed such as neurohormonal activation
specifically that of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympa￾thetic nervous systems, [4,5] hemodynamic alterations (especially
hypertension), [6] anemia, [6,7] pro-inflammatory cytokine
activation, [8] and oxidative stress. [9] Treatments targeting these
pathways have demonstrated beneficial effects on these structural
and functional changes as well as major clinical outcomes.
[10,11,12,13].
An important pathophysiological finding generally overlooked
as being contributory to cardiac dysfunction in CKD is the
accumulation of uremic toxins which are normally excreted by the
healthy kidney. In renal failure patients on conventional hemo￾dialysis, most of the accumulated toxins can be removed, however
some are insufficiently due to high protein-binding. Indoxyl sulfate
(IS) is one such protein-bound, poorly-dialysable uremic toxin. IS
is an intestinal bacterial metabolite derived from dietary trypto￾phan, [14] approximately 90% of circulating IS is albumin-bound.
[15] A pro-fibrotic effect of IS on the kidney has been reported
and found to be associated with CKD progression. [16] Treatment
with an IS-reducing agent, AST-120, has been shown to reverse
kidney fibrosis and delay CKD progression by adsorbing indole
(the IS precursor) in the gut. [16,17].

We have recently demonstrated that IS has both pro-fibrotic
and pro-hypertrophic effects on cardiac cells in vitro. [18] These
findings therefore suggest that IS may be implicated in uremic
cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the aim of the present in vivo study
was to test this hypothesis by determining whether IS-reducing
therapy may have beneficial effects on the cardiac manifestations
of CKD.
Results
The final total number of animals used in this study was 42
(Sham = 12, STNx + Vehicle = 17, STNx + AST-120 = 13). The
mortality rate after STNx surgery was 64.29% (54/84), this was
not different between the two STNx groups (61.36% for STNx +
Vehicle vs 67.5% for STNx + AST-120, p = 0.22).
Animal Characteristics
Table 1 shows general characteristics and renal function
parameters. A significant decrease in body weight (BW) was
observed in STNx + vehicle animals. The systolic tail-cuff BP was
significantly increased at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery in both
STNx groups.
Renal Function Assessment
Compared to sham, STNx animals had significantly higher
serum creatinine and urine total protein levels, and reduced GFR/
kg, creatinine clearance and hemoglobin levels. Treatment with
AST-120 significantly reduced serum creatinine by 54.2% and
urine total protein by 26.7% whilst having no effect on blood
pressure (Table 1).
Indoxyl Sulfate Levels
At week 8 and 12, STNx + Vehicle animals significantly had a
higher serum IS level than sham animals. A reduction in serum IS,
back to sham levels, was found in STNx + AST-120 animals from
8 weeks post-treatment. Baseline serum IS levels were comparable
among the groups (Table 1).
Serum IS at endpoint (12 weeks) showed a significant positive
correlation with serum creatinine (p,0.0001, r2= 0.6268) and 24-
hour urine total protein (p = 0.03, r2= 0.1573); expressed a
significant negative correlation with creatinine clearance
(p = 0.0006, r2= 0.3714) and GFR (p = 0.0006, r2= 0.3500).
Urine IS was significantly reduced in STNx + Vehicle animals
compared to sham animals and was significantly lower in STNx +
AST-120 than STNx + Vehicle animals (Table 1).
Cardiac Function and Hemodynamic Assessment
The heart weight/body weight (HW/BW), left ventricular
weight/body weight (LV/BW) and lung weight/body weight were
significantly increased in STNx + Vehicle and STNx + AST-120
compared to sham animals at 12 weeks. There was no difference
between STNx + Vehicle and STNx + AST-120 animals (Table 2).
Echocardiographic study. Compared to sham, both STNx
groups developed early diastolic dysfunction and cardiac hyper￾trophy.
E/A ratio and E9/A9 ratio was significantly reduced; and A
velocity and A9 velocity was significantly increased in STNx +
Vehicle and STNx + AST-120, however no difference between
these two groups was observed (Table 2). A trend toward increased
E/E9 ratio was observed in STNx + vehicle animals (p = 0.08).
LV mass, and individual interventricular septal (IVSd) and
posterior wall thicknesses (LVPWd) in diastole were significantly
greater in STNx + Vehicle and STNx + AST-120 with no
difference between these two groups.
Hemodynamic assessment. Pressure-volume loop analysis
showed a significant prolongation of t Logistic and t Weiss
following IVC occlusion and in steady state respectively in STNx +
Vehicle; this was not reversed by AST-120 treatment (Table 2).
Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), dP/dtmin
(mmHg/s), left ventricular end systolic pressure (LVESP), dP/
dtmax (mmHg/s) and the slope of the preload recruitable stroke
work (PRSW) relationship were not different among the three
groups (Table 2).
Cardiac Tissue Studies
Interstitial matrix deposition. Cardiac interstitial fibrosis
was significantly increased two-fold in STNx + Vehicle compared
to sham animals (p,0.0001). STNx + AST-120 significantly
reduced cardiac interstitial fibrosis by 68% (p,0.01 vs STNx +
Vehicle) (Fig. 1).
Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in
TGF-b, phospho-NFkB, phospho-p38 and phospho-p44/42,
protein expression in STNx + Vehicle (Fig. 2). Following treatment
with AST-120, a significant reduction in TGF-b and phospho￾NFkB was observed in STNx + Vehicle (p,0.05) back to sham
levels (Fig. 2).
Cardiac TGF-b1 and CTGF mRNA expression was signifi￾cantly increased in STNx + Vehicle compared to sham (p,0.01),
these were unaffected by AST-120 treatment (Fig. 3).
Degree of cardiac fibrosis was positively correlated with serum
IS levels (endpoint and change after STNx surgery) (Fig. 4,
p,0.01). On multivariate linear regression analysis, this was

significantly increased in STNx + Vehicle compared to sham
animals (p,0.001). This was unaffected with AST-120 treatment
(Fig. 5A).
Expression of ANP, b-MHC and a-SkM-Ac mRNA was
increased in both STNx + Vehicle and STNx + AST-120 groups
(Fig. 5B). AST-120 had no effect on pro-hypertrophic gene
expression.
Pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. A non￾significant increase in cardiac IL-6 mRNA expression was
observed in STNx + Vehicle animals. Treatment with AST-120
non-significantly reduced expression levels of IL-6 (data not
shown). There was no difference in cardiac TNF-a mRNA
expression among groups. Cardiac IL-1b mRNA expression was
expressed at levels too low to be detected with the same protocol
used to examine the other genes.
Discussion
In the present study, reductions in serum levels of the non￾dialysable uremic toxin, indoxyl sulfate, by the oral adsorbent,
AST-120, reduces the pathological cardiac fibrosis associated with
chronic kidney disease. This amelioration of cardiac fibrosis with
AST-120 occurred in the absence of any change in blood pressure.
CKD patients are more at risk of CV death than developing
end-stage renal disease. [2] The most common causes of CV death
are sudden cardiac death (SCD) and heart failure [6] which differs
from the general population. Coronary artery disease is also
commonly present in CKD patients but accounts for a much
smaller proportion than sudden cardiac death. [19] Increased risk
of SCD is associated with many factors such as cardiac structural
changes or the so-called uremic cardiomyopathy, large volume
and rapid electrolyte shifts during dialysis and derangements in
autonomic function. [20] Myocardial fibrosis with accompanying
hypertrophy, can mechanically impede electrical propagation
which induces electrical instability leading to arrhythmias and
SCD by re-entry mechanisms. [19] Noting that pathological
findings contributing to CV diseases in the CKD population are
not only limited to the heart but also present in blood vessels. For
instance, arterial stiffness and aortic calcification are common
vascular abnormalities correlated to left ventricular hypertrophy
[21] and possibly coronary heart disease if affecting coronary
arteries. [22].
Traditional CV risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes
mellitus and hyperlipidemia have less impact in CKD patients
than in the general population and are insufficient to explain the
unacceptably high prevalence of CV mortality. [23] A number of
non-traditional risk factors have been proposed as a contributor to
the progression of CKD including uremic toxins, in particular the
protein-bound subgroup. As previously mentioned, removal of

protein-bound uremic toxins is limited by current conventional
hemodialysis. Among these toxins, IS has extensively been studied
with regard to its adverse renal effects. IS has been demonstrated
to be implicated in increased renal oxidative stress, activation of
renal pro-fibrotic gene expression and progressive tubulointerstitial
fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis leading to further damage of the
remaining nephrons. [24].
Given common modes of induction of fibrosis in organs such as
heart and kidney we hypothesized that IS may also induce cardiac
fibrosis (as well as hypertrophy). We have reported this in our rat
cardiac cell culture studies. [18] The aim of the present study was
to test the hypothesis that reduction of serum IS levels that
accumulate in chronic kidney disease can prevent the cardiac
fibrosis that occurs in response to IS, as we had previously
demonstrated in vitro.
An oral carbonaceous adsorbent, AST-120, is well known as an
IS-lowering agent. AST-120 blocks the conversion of the IS
precursor, indole (a derivative of tryptophan), in the gut before it is
converted to IS by sulfation (a conjugation reaction which is part
of the liver detoxification system). A renoprotective effect of AST￾120 has previously been observed in both the CKD patient setting
as well as in pre-clinical models of renal dysfunction. Improved
renal function, delayed progression of CKD and improved survival
as well as a decrease in serum IS, urine IS and plasma TGF-b1
levels have been reported in non-dialysis CKD patients with AST￾120 treatment. [25,26,27,28] In a STNx animal model, admin￾istration of AST-120 prevents progressive glomerular sclerosis and
renal cortical interstitial fibrosis. [16,29] Increased renal TGF-b1
mRNA expression and NF-kB activation are induced by IS, both
in vitro and in vivo, [17,30] and these have been demonstrated in vivo
to be suppressed by AST-120. [17,29].
Recently, several clinical studies have reported beneficial
cardiovascular and cardiorenal effects of AST-120. Pre-dialysis
CKD patients who received AST-120 for more than 6 months had
a significant reduction in LV mass. [31] Another study of pre￾dialysis CKD patients showed significantly reduced arterial
stiffness and carotid intima media thickness. [32] Cardiorenal
protective effects of long-term (2 years) AST-120 treatment have
been demonstrated in chronic heart failure patients with moderate
CKD. These patients had an improvement in renal function,
edema, ANP levels, cardiothoracic ratio, length of hospital stay
and a reduced number of admissions after AST-120 treatment,
compared to before treatment. [33] However, mechanisms of the
cardioprotective effects of AST-120 have not been not well￾explored.
In the present study, the STNx model consistently produces
hypertension, fibrosis, hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction that
may precede development of systolic dysfunction. Levels of the
uremic toxin, IS, are markedly elevated in this model, consistent
with the observations made in clinical practice where the toxin is

unable to be adequately dialyzed and therefore accumulates in a
progressive manner. [34] Our finding that cardiac fibrosis was
reduced by AST-120 is parallel to reductions of serum and urine
IS levels. These changes occurred independently of changes in
blood pressure, suggesting an important contribution of uremic
toxins to the so-called uremic cardiomyopathy. A positive
correlation between cardiac fibrosis and serum IS levels, indepen￾dent of improvements in renal function (serum creatinine and 24-
hour urine total protein) suggest that the reduction of cardiac
fibrosis by AST-120 treatment is at least in part directly due to its
IS lowering effect.
Mechanistic analysis of AST-120 reducing cardiac fibrosis
showed a significant reduction in cardiac TGF-b and phospho￾NFkB p65 protein expression. These findings are consistent with
those previously reported in proximal tubular cells following AST￾120 administration. [35] This study also demonstrated IS-induced
phospho-NFkB p65 activation in cultured human proximal
tubular cells. Inhibition of NFkB p65 using an antioxidant
suppressed IS-induced TGF-b1 protein expression in uremic rats.
The authors concluded that the adverse effects of IS on the
proximal tubular cells may be mediated via reactive oxygen
species-NF-kB-TGF-b1 pathway. The same pathway may play a
role in IS-induced cardiac fibrosis in the present study.
NF-kB p65/p50 is a common dimer of the classical pathway of
NF-kB activation, which plays a pivotal role in regulating both
nuclear translocation and gene transcription. The anti-phospho￾NF-kB p65 antibody used in the present study is specific for the
phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 located in C-terminal
transcription activation domain. Phosphorylation of p65 at serine
536 is associated with nuclear translocation following activation.

an increase in cardiac TGF-b, phospho-NFkB, phospho-p38 and phospho-p44/42 expression (A, B, C, and D, respectively). AST-120 significantly
suppresses cardiac TGF-b and phospho-NFkB (A and B) but not phospho-p38 and phospho-p44/42 expression (C and D). *p,0.05, **p,0.01 vs Sham;

[36] Thus, the IS-induced NF- kB p65 (Ser536) phosphorylation is
likely to represent the functionality of NF-kB. In addition, an
increase in TGF- b protein expression observed in the present
study suggests that TGF- b may be one of the target genes
transcribed by an NF-kB in the IS-induced cardiac fibrosis
pathway.
The anti-fibrotic effect of AST-120 on the kidney has not only
been demonstrated in a severe CKD model of 5/6-STNx but also
in the less severe 3/4-STNx [29,37], combined unilateral
nephrectomy and diabetic nephropathy [38] and diabetic
nephropathy only models. [39] As previously mentioned, renal
fibrosis is also a key characteristic finding in progressive CKD.
This suggests that administration of AST-120 in earlier stages of
CKD may prevent CKD progression and in turn prevent
cardiovascular complications.
Systemic inflammatory activation is common and is a critical
mechanism in the progression of both CKD [40] and HF. [41]
However, the present study did not observe any significant
changes in cardiac pro-inflammatory mRNA expression in both
STNx + Vehicle and STNx + AST-120 groups. There was no
change in the mRNA levels of TGF-b1 and CTGF while a
reduction in the protein levels was observed in this study. This may
be explained by a different pattern of gene compared to protein
activation where by 16 weeks post-STNx gene activation had
already peaked and then declined prior to the observed increase in
protein expression.
Our group has investigated effects of protein-bound uremic
toxins on cultured cardiac fibroblasts determined by 3
H-proline
incorporation. The results showed that indoxyl sulfate had the
strongest pro-fibrotic effect while p-cresol had a weak effect and m￾cresol and m- and p-cresyl sulfate had no pro-fibrotic effect. [42] IS
has recently been demonstrated as the most promising biomarker
of the effect of AST-120 in STNx rats among other problematic
protein-bound uremic toxins (such as p-cresyl sulfate, hippuric
acid, phenyl sulfate and 4-ethylphenyl sulfate) of which circulatory
levels are reduced by AST-120. [43].
These findings are of considerable clinical significance given the
large burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated
with patients who have CKD. Given that AST-120 is available in
a number of countries (and currently in Phase III studies in Europe
and North America), these findings are also of therapeutic
relevance given that circulating IS levels were reduced and

cardiac fibrosis ameliorated with oral administration in the present
study.
The present study also sought to determine mechanisms by
which such amelioration of cardiac fibrosis in response to AST￾120 might be occurring. We observed a reduction in TGF-b
protein expression supporting this pathway as a key contributor to
the reduction in pathological cardiac fibrosis in the uremic
cardiomyopathy setting, via reduction of uremic toxins.
Study limitiations. In most patients with CKD, some form
of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade would
be prescribed as background therapy. However, only a partial, not
complete, reversal of uremic cardiomyopathy is observed with
ACE inhibitors in CKD patients on hemodialysis. [44] The
present study did not include a RAAS blocker, either as
comparator or in combination with AST-120, since we wished
to first conduct a proof-of-concept study examining the contribu￾tion of uremic toxins to cardiac fibrosis, as well as the potential
therapeutic implications of reducing of serum levels of IS. Such
combination studies to RAAS blockers remain to be performed
and will be of major clinical relevance.
We also did not observe any major evidence of amelioration of
cardiac dysfunction observed in the sub-total nephrectomy setting
by AST-120. Subtle changes in cardiac fibrosis with AST-120
treatment may not necessarily be accompanied by functional
alterations at 12 weeks. This may be at least in part representative
of the time it takes for pathological cardiac fibrosis to contribute to
the subsequent dysfunction and conversely the time it may take for
reduction in pathological cardiac fibrosis to contribute to reversal
of the ventricular remodeling process. Unfortunately, the 5/6
subtotal nephrectomy model is extremely aggressive and longer
term follow-up studies to test this hypothesis may be difficult to
conduct due to the high mortality observed over a relatively short
period of time.
Nevertheless, despite these considerations, the present study has
demonstrated a clear beneficial effect on pathological cardiac
fibrosis using a strategy to reduce serum indoxyl sulfate levels in
rats with chronic kidney disease. Given the absence of changes in
blood pressure these findings would suggest that uremic toxemia
contributes directly to the cardiac fibrosis observed in this setting
and that reduction in circulating levels of uremic toxins,
specifically that of indoxyl sulfate, may be of therapeutic benefit
with regard to the cardiac effects of CKD.
Methods
Study Design
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) underwent subtotal (5/
6) nephrectomy (STNx). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with
1.0–2.0% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. An upper midline
abdominal incision was performed. Left renal artery and its
branches were exposed and two-third of the blood supply to the
left kidney was blocked by ligation with a 4.0 silk suture. A surface
area of tissue discoloration was re-examined to confirm 2/3
infarction. The right renal artery was then ligated and the right
kidney removed and abdominal wall and skin sutured. When
conscious, all animals received subcutaneous buprenorphine
(0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) for analgesia. STNx animals were then
randomized after a full recovery to receive either AST-120 (STNx
+ AST-120, n = 13) or no treatment (STNx + vehicle, n = 17) for
12 weeks. AST-120 (KremezinH, Kureha Pharmaceuticals, To￾kyo, Japan) was administrated post-operatively in the chow at 8%
w/w. Sham operated rats (n = 12) were used as controls.
Figure 5. AST-120 shows no effects on cardiac hypertrophy as well as pro-hypertrophic mRNA expression in the STNx model.
Compared to sham, STNx animals show a significant increase in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (A) and cardiac mRNA expression of ANP, b-MHC
and a-SkM-Ac genes (B). There was no difference between untreated and AST-120-treated groups. **p,0.01, ***p,0.001 vs Sham.

Serum IS level was measured at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks;
and urine IS at 8 and 12 weeks. Cardiac and renal function,
including hemoglobin levels was assessed prior to sacrifice at 12
weeks. Tail-cuff blood pressure was measured in conscious rats at
4, 8 and 12 weeks post-STNx.
Tissues were assessed for pathological and molecular changes
using histological methods, western blot analysis and real-time
PCR.
The investigation conformed with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health (PHS Approved Animal Welfare Assurance
no. A5587-01). All animal usage was approved by St Vincent’s
Hospital’s Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) in accordance with
National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals (AEC no. 005/09).
Cardiac Function Assessment – Echocardiography and
Millar Catheterization
At the end of 12 weeks, echocardiography was performed in
lightly anaesthetized animals (ketamine 40 mg/kg, xylazine 5 mg/
kg, ip) using a Vivid 7 (GE Vingmed, Horten, Norway)
echocardiography machine with a 10 MHz phased array probe.
The procedure was performed as per published standard protocol
and as routinely performed in our laboratory. [45].
Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg, i.p.)
and intubated for cardiac catheterization procedures, as previously
described. [46] Briefly, animals were ventilated and a 2F
miniaturized combined catheter/micromanometer (Model
SPR838 Millar instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted into the
right common carotid artery to obtain aortic blood pressure and
then advanced into the left ventricle to obtain left ventricular
pressure–volume (PV) loops. PV loops were recorded at steady
state and during transient preload reduction, achieved by
occlusion of the inferior vena cava and portal vein with the
ventilator turned off and animal apnoeic. The following validated
parameters were assessed using Millar conductance data acquisi￾tion and analysis software PVAN 3.2: left ventricular end systolic
pressure (LVESP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP),
dP/dtmax, dP/dtmin, Tau (t Logistic and t Weiss at steady state),
and the slope of the preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW)
relationship.
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
One day prior to sacrifice, GFR was performed to measure
kidney function. Briefly, animals were injected with 0.26 ml (i.v.)
of the radioactive isotope, 99technetium-diethylene triamine penta￾acetic acid (99Tc-DTPA) prepared at a rate of 37 MBq/ml (1mCi/
mL). Animals were bled 43 minutes later and their plasma
radioactivity measured and compared to the counts of the
standard reference prepared at the time of injection. GFR/kg
body weight was calculated as described in previous studies
published by our group. [47].
Biochemical Analysis
Serum was separated from blood by centrifugation at
3000 r.p.m. for 15 min, and samples were stored at 280uC.
Urine samples were stored at 220uC until analysis. Serum and
urine IS levels were measured by a high performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). [48] Sample
(10 ml) were analyzed with HPLC-MS by mobile phase using 5%
tetrahydrofuran/0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min, and fluorescence detection (excitation 295 nm and emission
390 nm.) [48] Serum creatinine, urine creatinine and urine total
protein levels were measured using Cobas IntegraH 400 Plus
Bioanalyzer (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as per manufacturers’
instructions. Creatinine clearance was calculated using the
following formula:
Creatinine clearance ml ð Þ =min
~ urinary creatinine x collected urine volume ml ð Þ
serum creatinine x time period of urine collection min ð Þ
Histological Analysis
Hearts were removed after catheterization measurements and
weighed, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then
processed for histopathology. Paraffin-embedded sections (4 mm)
were prepared for histological staining.
Cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac sections, stained with
picrosirius red for matrix deposition, [49] were scanned (Aperio,
Aperio Technologies Inc., Vista, CA) for analysis. Picrosirius red￾stained matrix deposition from the whole LV myocardium,
excluding perivascular fibrosis was selected for its intensity, and
the proportional area was calculated using a preset algorithm for
picrosirius red stain intensity. [50].
Cardiomyocyte Cross-sectional Area
Fifty LV cardiomyocytes with equal-sized nuclei were randomly
selected for analysis of cross-sectional area from pre-scanned
images. Cell surface areas were calculated by measuring circum￾ferential length of the myocyte using Aperio ScanScope (Aperio,
Aperio Technologies Inc., Vista, CA). Measurements from each
animal were averaged and data expressed as mean 6 SEM for
each group.
Western Blot Analysis
Supernatant from homogenized LV cardiac tissue (30 mg) was
collected and protein concentrations measured by the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein
(30 mg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryl￾amide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). [51] Western
blot analysis was performed as per manufacturer protocol with
specific antibodies (TGF-b, phospho-p44/42, p44/42, phospho￾p38, p38, phospho-nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) p65 (Ser536),
NF-kB p65 antibodies– Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
USA; pan-actin antibody – NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) and then
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo
Scientific). Band intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software
(NCBI). [18] Pan-actin and total-proteins were used as endoge￾nous controls to correct for non-phosphorylated protein and the
corresponding phosphorylated-protein expression, respectively.
Quantitative mRNA Expression in Left Ventricular Tissue
Total RNA was extracted from 30 mg of cardiac tissue using the
RNAqueousTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA and triplicate cDNA aliquots were amplified
using either sequence-specific primers (Geneworks, Adelaide, SA,
Australia) with SYBR Green detection (for pro-fibrotic and pro￾inflammatory cytokine genes; Applied Biosystems) or premixed
primer-probe (for pro-hypertrophic genes and GAPDH; Applied
Biosystems) using an ABI prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was used to quantify pro-fibrotic [transforming growth

factor-beta 1(TGF-b1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)],
pro-hypertrophic [atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), beta-myosin
heavy chain (b-MHC), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (a-SkM-Ac)]
and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b) gene
expression. The primer pairs were designed using Primer Express
2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) based on published sequences
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The forward primer of TGF-b1
was 59-CCA GCC GCG GGA CTC T-39, and the reverse primer
was 59-TTC CGT TTC ACC AGC TCC AT-39; and the forward
primer of CTGF was 59-GCG GCG AGT CCT TCC AA-39, and
the reverse primer was 59-CCA CGG CCC CAT CCA-39.
GAPDH, used as the endogenous control to correct for the
expression of each gene, ANP, b-MHC and a-SkM-Ac probe and
primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems Assays on
Demand.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as means 6 SEM. One-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test or Kruskal-Wallis test with
Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used for comparisons
among all groups for parametric and non-parametric data,
respectively. For comparisons between 2 groups, unpaired Student
t-test was used for parametric data and Mann Whitney test for
non-parametric data. Statistical analyses were performed by using
GraphPad Prism software version 5 and multiple linear regression
analysis by SPSS. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
