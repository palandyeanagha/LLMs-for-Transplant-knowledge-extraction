Abstract
Background: The gene for methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) lies on 9p21, close to the gene CDKN2A that
encodes the tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p14ARF. MTAP and CDKN2A are homozygously co-deleted, with a
frequency of 35 to 70%, in lung and pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, mesothelioma, and
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In normal cells, but not in tumor cells lacking MTAP, MTAP cleaves the natural
substrate, 59-deoxy-59-methylthioadenosine (MTA), to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P), which are
then converted to adenine nucleotides and methionine. This distinct difference between normal MTAP-positive cells and
tumor MTAP-negative cells led to several proposals for therapy. We offer a novel strategy in which both MTA and a toxic
adenine analog, such as 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), 6-methylpurine (MeP), or 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade), are administered. In
MTAP-positive cells, abundant adenine, generated from supplied MTA, competitively blocks the conversion of an analog, by
adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), to its active nucleotide form. In MTAP-negative tumor cells, the supplied MTA
cannot generate adenine; hence conversion of the analog is not blocked.
Principal Findings: We show that this combination treatment – adenine analog plus MTA – kills MTAP-negative A549 lung
tumor cells, while MTAP-positive human fibroblasts (HF) are protected. In co-cultures of the breast tumor cell line, MCF-7,
and HF cells, MCF-7 is inhibited or killed, while HF cells proliferate robustly. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG)
may also be used with our strategy. Though neither analog is activated by APRT, in MTAP-positive cells, adenine produced
from supplied MTA blocks conversion of 5-FU and 6-TG to their toxic nucleotide forms by competing for 5-phosphoribosyl￾1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The combination of MTA with 5-FU or 6-TG, in the treatment of MTAP-negative tumors, may
produce a significantly improved therapeutic index.
Conclusion: We describe a selective strategy to kill tumor cells lacking MTAP.

Introduction
MTA was discovered almost one hundred years ago, and its
correct structure described not long after. But fifty years passed
before Pegg and Williams-Ashman found the enzyme MTAP that
catalyzes the phosphorolysis of MTA to adenine and MTR-1-P
[1]. This pathway is the only known source of free cellular
adenine. MTA is produced from S-adenosyl-L-methionine during
synthesis of the polyamines, spermidine and spermine. Both
products of MTA cleavage by MTAP are reused: adenine is
returned to the adenine nucleotide pool through the enzyme
APRT, and MTR-1-P is metabolized, by a series of additional
steps, to methionine and formate (Figure 1). Thus MTAP plays a
crucial role in recycling of the adenine and methylthio moieties of
MTA back to the metabolites from which S-adenosyl-L-methio￾nine is formed – ATP and methionine. All normal mammalian
tissues contain MTAP – at least no exceptions have been found –
and this enzyme keeps cellular MTA at very low levels [2].
After Toohey found that some murine leukemia cell lines lack
MTAP [3], others reported that many of the most common
human tumors are also deficient in MTAP. This deficiency occurs
because the MTAP gene is often homozygously co-deleted with
the CDKN2A gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor proteins
p16 and p14ARF. The common occurrence of MTAP-deficiency
in some of those tumors that have been most resistant to treatment
is striking. About 40% of non-small cell lung, pancreatic, and
biliary tract cancer, 70% of mesothelioma and glioblastoma, and
35% of osteosarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia lack MTAP [4–11].
In malignant melanoma, loss of MTAP-expression is also
common – with one report placing it as high as 60% – but in this
tumor the deficiency appears to be due to promoter hypermethy￾lation [12]. Information on the incidence of MTAP-deficiency in
breast cancer is still limited, but of nine cell lines tested, four,
including the often-studied MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were
MTAP-negative [13].
The discovery that MTAP is often absent in tumors led to
proposals for a selective therapy that would inhibit or kill tumor
cells, but leave host cells relatively unharmed. Two distinct
approaches were suggested. In the first, Carson and colleagues
showed that inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, methotrexate or
azaserine, in combination with MTA, selectively killed MTAP￾PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e5735

negative cells, while sparing MTAP-positive cells which could
derive their purine nucleotide requirements from the supplied
MTA [14]. A number of studies that followed up on this proposal
examined other inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, such as 5,10-
dideazotetrahydrofolate and L-alanosine, an inhibitor of AMP
synthesis from IMP [15].
To determine whether inhibitors of purine biosynthesis might act
selectively against MTAP-negative tumors, two multi-center Phase
I/II clinical trials of L-alanosine were started, but both trials were
suspended early [16,17]. A recent report on one of these
abbreviated trials concluded that this treatment was ineffective [18].
In the second approach, Tisdale proposed that if serum were
depleted of methionine by a methioninase, normal cells, but not
MTAP-negative tumor cells, could be rescued by providing MTA,
which is cleaved to MTR-1-P and leads to methionine synthesis
[19]. As yet, there have been no reported clinical trials of this
proposed therapy.
We have developed a novel strategy that takes advantage of
MTA metabolism to provide a selective therapy of MTAP￾negative tumors (Fig. 1). Our strategy involves two agents: a purine
or pyrimidine analog toxic to both MTAP-negative tumor cells and
MTAP-positive normal cells, and a second agent that protects the
normal cells.
The adenine analogs DAP, MeP, and F-Ade are especially
effective with our method. In normal, non-tumor cells, when
MTA, or another MTAP substrate, 59-deoxyadenosine (59-dAdo),
is present in sufficient amount, the abundant adenine produced
from these substrates, by the action of MTAP, competes with these
analogs for phosphoribosylation by APRT and the cells are
protected from toxicity. In MTAP-negative tumor cells, adenine is
not produced from MTA or 59-dAdo, and the cells are killed by
the adenine analog.
DAP was actually the first purine analog synthesized by Elion
and Hitchings and put into clinical trials at Memorial Sloan￾Kettering in the late 1940s, where it produced two good clinical
remissions in chronic granulocytic leukemia and one remarkable
long-term remission in a patient with acute leukemia, after only
three weeks of drug treatment [20]. Because two other patients
showed toxic side effects, however, clinical application of DAP was
abandoned.
MeP and F-Ade have also been of recent interest because of
their marked potency. Even single injections of MeP into tumors
growing in immunodeficient mice have shown pronounced and
prolonged antitumor effects [21]. Both analogs have also been
prepared as riboside prodrugs. When isolated pancreatic or glioma
tumors were transduced with a genetically engineered purine
nucleoside phosphorylase, MeP or F-Ade was released from the
prodrugs, producing a marked reduction in tumor size [22].
Other purine and pyrimidine analogs also require PRPP for
conversion, by cellular phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs), to their
toxic nucleotides. In MTAP-positive, but not MTAP-negative
cells, adenine derived from MTA (or another MTAP substrate)
competes with such analogs for reaction with PRPP in their
respective phosphoribosylations, thus blocking the conversion of
these drugs to their nucleotides.
Two clinical cancer drugs – 5-FU and 6-TG – might thus be
used in our proposed strategy. In the case of 6-TG, the PRT is
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. For 5-FU, sev￾eral different pathways can be involved in activation but a
principal one is conversion by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase to
the nucleotide of 5-FU. If MTA or 59-dAdo is supplied to an
MTAP-positive cell, the increased flux of adenine, through the
APRT-pathway, would reduce available cellular PRPP and thus
limit the conversion of 5-FU and 6-TG to their toxic nucleotides.
Consistent with this idea, previous in vitro studies did indeed find
that adenine reduces the toxicity of 5-FU and 6-TG [23,24] and
one report describes the same effect in mice [25].
Our proposed strategy may allow the use of high drug
concentrations, lethal to MTAP-negative tumors, but with
decreased toxicity to host cells.
Figure 1. MTAP metabolic pathway. In normal cells, MTAP cleaves MTA, a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis, into adenine and MTR-1-P.
Adenine is converted to AMP by the ubiquitous enzyme APRT, with PRPP serving as donor of the phosphoribosyl group. MTR-1-P is converted by a
series of steps to methionine. AMP is also produced in cells by de novo purine biosynthesis. In addition to APRT, other cellular
phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs), such as hypoxanthine-guanine phsophoribosyl transferase and orotate phosphoribosyltranferase, covert purines
and pyrimidines to nucleotides.

Killing MTAP Negative Tumors

Results
Selective killing of MTAP-negative cells by adenine
analogs
MTAP-positive HF cells were cultured for three days with DAP
(100 mM), MeP (5 mM), or F-Ade (0.3 mM), with or without the
MTAP substrates MTA or 59-dAdo. The adenine analogs
produced strong inhibition of growth of HF cells. This inhibition
was almost entirely prevented by 15 mM MTA or 59-dAdo
(Figure 2A). Adenine at 15 mM gave results similar to those with
59-dAdo (data not shown).
MTA alone caused modest inhibition of HF cell growth. After 3
days at 15 mM, growth reached 85% of control; at 30 mM, 75%.
In contrast, 59-Ado, tested at concentrations as high as 150 mM,
did not significantly inhibit growth.
Unlike MTAP-positive HF cells, MTAP-negative A549 cells,
treated with the adenine analog MeP (5 mM), were not protected
by the addition of MTA or 59-dAdo (Figure 2A). Three controls –
MeP (5 mM) with adenine (15 mM), MTA alone (15 mM), and 59-
dAdo alone (15 mM) – as expected, showed growth nearly equal to
that of untreated cells. Similar results were found with the analogs
DAP and F-Ade (data not shown).
Selective killing of MTAP-negative cells in co-culture with
MTAP-positive cells
To quantitatively assess selective killing of tumor cells when they
are present in excess of normal cells, co-culture experiments were
designed. For this purpose, a ouabain-resistant cell line, A549-r,
was used to facilitate determination of viable tumor clones in the
presence of HF cells.
45,000 A549-r and 3,000 HF cells were cultured, in
quadruplicate, with DAP at 125 mM, and 59-dAdo at 0, 7.5, or
15 mM. After three days of incubation, two of the four dishes were
trypsinized and serially diluted into fresh medium, with added
adenine (15 mM), for clonogenic assay of viable A549-r cells. After
two additional days of culture, ouabain (0.1 mM) was added to
inhibit or kill HF cells; without ouabain it would have been
difficult to count a small number of surviving A549-r clones among
a large number of growing HF cells. After several weeks in culture,
A549-r clones were sufficiently large to be seen readily after
staining with crystal violet. The remaining two dishes were serially
diluted into medium, with adenine (15 mM), but no ouabain was
added. Hence viable HF clones could grow and be counted.
Treatment of HF cell cultures with DAP for three days
decreased the number of colony–forming cells to about 15% of
the initial value. But with 59-dAdo (7.5 or 15 mM) added to DAP,
HF viability increased about three-fold, showing protection of HF
cells from toxicity of DAP. In contrast, when 59-dAdo and DAP
were added to cultures of MTAP-negative A549-r cultures,
viability of A549-r cells decreased markedly, and dishes that
initially contained 45,000 viable cells showed less than 200 clones
(Figure 2B).
To determine whether selective killing of tumor cells could be
demonstrated with a different MTAP-negative tumor cell line, we
co-cultured HF and MCF-7 for three days. With no additions,
both the fiber-like HF and the larger clumps of tumor cells grew
robustly (Figures 3A, 3B). With just DAP alone, both HF and
MCF-7 appeared to be dead, and subcultures confirmed that they
were (Figure 3C and data not shown). But in the presence of
protective MTA, while MCF-7 cells were killed, HF cells
continued to proliferate (Figure 3D). In a similar experiment,
HF and MCF-7, in the presence of DAP and MTA, were co￾cultured for four days and then subcultured for an additional five
days, without drugs, to assess survival of MCF-7 (Figure 4A,B,C,D).
By then, only HF cells could be seen, without any evidence of
MCF-7 clones (Figure 4D).
The results of the co-culture experiments with HF and MTAP￾negative tumor cells, in the presence of the toxic analog DAP and
the protective agents 59-dAdo or MTA, are significant (Figures 2B,
3, and 4). They suggest that if this strategy is to be applied in vivo,
the presence of large numbers of normal host cells will not
interfere substantially with selective killing of tumor cells.
Other analogs that compete for PRPP
As outlined in the introduction, MTAP substrates were expected
to protect MTAP-positive cells from toxicity of the analogs 5-FU
or 6-TG. Adenine produced from these substrates would compete
with 5-FU or 6-TG for PRPP, and prevent conversion of the
analogs to their nucleotides. To test this prediction, we treated
MTAP-positive cells ML-1 and HF cells with 5-FU (3 mM). This
concentration of 5-FU inhibited ML-1 and HF growth by about
50%. The addition of 59-dAdo (60 mM) resulted in a doubling of
growth, to levels about equal to that in untreated cultures
(Figure 5a,b). At a higher concentration of 5-FU (10 mM) we
could not demonstrate protection from toxicity by 59-dAdo, and at
a lower concentration of 5-FU (1 mM), cell growth was not
inhibited (data not shown).
We also tested 6-TG (20 mM) and found that 59-dAdo provided
strong protection of HF cells (Figure 5c). With DAP at 50 mM, a
concentration that does not cause maximum inhibition of growth,
59-dAdo, as expected, protected HF cells from toxicity (Figure 5d).
The combination of 6-TG and DAP at these concentrations was
strongly inhibitory, but 59-dAdo still provided strong protection
from toxicity (Figure 5e). This result shows that drugs with
different metabolic routes may act synergistically against MTAP￾negative tumors and that MTAP-positive cells can be protected
from these combinations. At a higher concentration of 6-TG
(40 mM), 59-dAdo (15 mM) still protected HF cells. Last, the
experiments with 6-TG were repeated with MTA as the MTAP
substrate, with results similar to those found with 59-dAdo (data
not shown).
Discussion
Summary of our findings
We demonstrate the salient features of a proposed strategy for
treating tumors deficient in MTAP. The MTAP substrates, MTA
and 59-dAdo, protect MTAP-positive HF cells from toxicity of the
adenine analogs DAP, MeP, and F-Ade (Figure 2A). In similar
experiments with MTAP-negative A549 cells, no such protection
occurred (Figure 2A).
In a stringent test of our strategy, we co-cultured HF cells with
an excess of MTAP-negative A549-r cells in the presence of DAP
and 59-dAdo. While HF cells were protected from DAP toxicity,
A549-r cells were not, and their viable cell numbers decreased
markedly (Figure 2B). Similarly, co-cultures of another MTAP￾negative cell line, MCF-7, with HF cells, in the presence of DAP
and MTA, killed the MCF-7 cells and gave rise to apparently pure
cultures of HF cells (Figures 3,4).
We also show that adenine produced by the MTAP substrate
59-dAdo protected MTAP-positive cells from the toxic effects of 5-
FU or 6-TG (Figure 5a,b,c,f). For 5-FU, we show this protection
for two different types of MTAP-positive cells: ML-1 and HF
(Figure 5a,b). The results with 5-FU and 6-TG are consistent with
the interpretation that the abundant adenine supplied by 59-dAdo
competes with 5-FU or 6-TG for PRPP, preventing conversion of
these analogs to their toxic products. In addition, 59-dAdo
protected HF cells not only from the toxicity of 6-TG alone, but

from three independent experiments, bars SE. (B) For co-culture experiments, the ouabain-resistant cell line A549-r was used. Stocks of HF and A549-r
cells were trypsinized and cell numbers counted to determine the amount of each cell line to be seeded for co-culture. To measure the initial number
of viable cells, each cell line was separately seeded, in duplicate, into dishes for clonogenic assay. For co-cultures, each dish had 45,000 A549-r and
3,000 HF cells, with DAP at 125 mM, and 59-dAdo at 0, 7.5, or 15 mM. After three days of incubation, two dishes were trypsinized and serially diluted
into fresh medium, with adenine (15 mM) added to suppress further action of DAP, for clonogenic assay of viable A549-r clones. After two additional
days of culture, ouabain (0.1 mM) was added to these dishes to inhibit or kill HF cells, while permitting the small number of surviving A540-r cells to
grow and form large clones. The remaining two dishes did not receive ouabain and hence viable HF clones could grow and be identified by staining.
Counts from duplicate dishes were averaged. Data from two independent experiments, bars SE.

also from the combination of 6-TG with DAP (Figure 5c,f).
Application of such combinations may provide not only synergistic
tumor killing but may also decrease the risk of resistance emerging
during treatment.
6-TG, 5-FU, and prodrugs, such as capecitabine, have, of
course, a long history of clinical applications. A trial of our strategy
to enhance the effective treatment of MTAP-negative tumors, by
6-TG or 5-FU, would require a clinical test of just one new type of
drug: MTA, or some other MTAP substrate.
Is MTAP active in serum?
If MTAP activity in serum were high enough to convert
administered MTA (or another MTAP substrate) to significant
levels of adenine, this might indiscriminately protect not just
MTAP-positive host cells, but MTAP-negative tumor cells as well.
MTAP was reported to be present in human serum [26]. But
MTAP has an absolute requirement for phosphate, and at
physiological levels of phosphate, MTAP activity in human serum
was found to be negligible [27].
Toxicity of MTA in vivo
MTA has been tested in mice and rats and found to be non￾toxic at high doses even when given over extended periods [28,29].
MTA has also been administered orally to ten humans at
1,600 mg/kg daily, for one month, and seems to be nontoxic
[30]. In mice, after intraperitoneal administration at 75 mg/kg,

drugs added as follows: (A) Start of co-culture. (B) Three days without drugs. (C) Three days with DAP (200 mM). (D) Three days with DAP (200 mM)
and MTA (50 mM). Representative fields are shown.

serum levels of MTA reached a peak of 28 mM rapidly and, at
30 minutes, MTA was still at 10 mM [29]. These levels are
comparable to those shown to protect HF cells in culture from
toxicity of adenine analogs and 6-TG (Figures 2A, 5). After
intraperitoneal doses of 75 mg/kg daily, for 28 days, no toxicity
was found [29].
MTA is a potent inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and
produces dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in culture [31–
33]. As noted above, it is not toxic to mice, at least at repeated bolus
doses of 75 mg/kg [29]. We found that it was not toxic at 50 to100
mg/kg and that it protected mice from lethal doses of 6-TG [34].
The strategy presented here does not depend entirely on use of
MTA. More than three dozen MTA analogs have been
synthesized [35–39]. There may be many that are good candidates
for testing.
Optimization of therapy
In mouse studies by others, F-Ade, MeP, and MTA, when given
intraperitoneally, were rapidly taken up by tissues [22,29]. We
found that treatment for four hours with either F-Ade or MeP was
highly cytotoxic (data not shown). For such toxic analogs, that are
absorbed and act rapidly, our proposed strategy may be most

effective if protective MTA (or another MTAP substrate) is given
as a bolus dose, followed at some interval by a bolus dose of the
toxic analog. Further improvements may be made by using
combinations of analogs.
Inhibitors of purine biosynthesis, such as methotrexate, are
known to increase the effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic
agents by raising PRPP levels [40]. Pretreatments with metho￾trexate may reduce the amount of analog needed for therapy and
also reduce the amount of MTAP substrate needed to protect the
host. Our strategy is directed at treatment of MTAP-negative
tumors. There are potent inhibitors of MTAP which, if targeted to
MTAP-positive tumor cells, could effectively make them pheno￾typically negative and susceptible to our treatment [41].
We have studied just a few toxic purine and pyrimidine analogs,
but many others are known or may be synthesized. Those that
deserve further study, because of their demonstrated anti-tumor
activity, include 6-mercaptopurine, 8-azaguanine, and 8-azaade￾nine. Of the many known MTAP substrates, we have tested just
MTA and 59-dAdo. The substrate 9-beta-D-erythrofuranosylade￾nine has only slight toxicity to hematopoietic progenitor cells in
human bone marrow, and is a promising candidate for use with
our strategy, in vivo [42].
Materials and Methods
Cell sources and culture
Colleagues at Dartmouth Medical School generously supplied
cells: MTAP-positive human dermal fibroblasts (HF), and the
myeloblastic leukemia cell line (ML-1) and MTAP-negative non￾small cell lung carcinoma (A549) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7).
A ouabain-resistant line, A549-r, was made in our laboratory by n￾methyl-n9-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis and selection in
ouabain. This cell line grows well in 0.2 mM ouabain.
For adherent HF, A549, A549-r and MCF-7, cells were
cultured in 6 cm-diameter tissue culture dishes at 37uC in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, dialyzed
against 20 volumes of isotonic saline, with four changes over two
days), penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 mg/ml). For
experiments with adherent cell lines, cells were seeded into dishes
and, one day later, by which time the cells had attached to the
substrate, medium was replaced with 4 ml of fresh medium and
drugs added as given in the Legends. ML-1 cells were seeded from
stocks and grown in suspension in RPMI-1640 with 10% dialyzed
FBS. Media, chemicals, and drugs were obtained from Sigma￾Aldrich and 2-fluoroadenine from the Drug Synthesis and
Chemistry Branch/ Developmental Therapeutics Program/Divi￾sion of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute.
Cell growth and viability
At the end of an experiment with adherent HF, A549, and
A549-r cells, culture dishes were trypsinized for determination,
with a Coulter counter, of cell numbers, or diluted serially into
complete medium for clonogenic assay. After a period sufficient
for clones to reach a size visible by eye (two to three weeks), they
were stained with a solution of crystal violet in saline/methanol.
From these counts and from the dilution factors, the numbers of
viable cells in the parent cultures were calculated. For photomi￾croscopy, culture dishes were rinsed with saline and fixed by the
addition of 5% glutaraldehyde/saline.
