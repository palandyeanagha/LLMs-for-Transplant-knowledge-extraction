Abstract
Background: Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity and bone turnover. Here, we
assessed the potential association of sclerostin with the development of coronary artery (CAC) and aortic valve
calcifications (AVC) in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-slice computed tomography (MS-CT) scanning study in 67 chronic
HD patients (59.4 ± 14.8 yrs) for measurement of CAC and AVC. We tested established biomarkers as well as serum
sclerostin (ELISA) regarding their association to the presence of calcification. Fifty-four adults without relevant renal
disease served as controls for serum sclerostin levels. Additionally, sclerostin expression in explanted aortic valves
from 15 dialysis patients was analysed ex vivo by immunohistochemistry and mRNA quantification (Qt-RT-PCR).
Results: CAC (Agatston score > 100) and any AVC were present in 65% and in 40% of the MS-CT patient group,
respectively. Serum sclerostin levels (1.53 ± 0.81 vs 0.76 ± 0.31 ng/mL, p < 0.001) were significantly elevated in
HD compared to controls and more so in HD patients with AVC versus those without AVC (1.78 ± 0.84 vs 1.35 ±
0.73 ng/mL, p = 0.02). Multivariable regression analysis for AVC revealed significant associations with higher serum
sclerostin. Ex vivo analysis of uraemic calcified aortic valves (n = 10) revealed a strong sclerostin expression very
close to calcified regions (no sclerostin staining in non-calcified valves). Correspondingly, we observed a highly
significant upregulation of sclerostin mRNA in calcified valves compared to non-calcified control valves.
Conclusion: We found a strong association of sclerostin with calcifying aortic heart valve disease in haemodialysis
patients. Sclerostin is locally produced in aortic valve tissue adjacent to areas of calcification.

Background
The majority of long-term haemodialysis (HD) patients
are affected by cardiovascular calcification (CVC) [1,2].
CVC constitutes one of the driving forces for the enor￾mously elevated cardiovascular mortality in patients with
CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [3,4].
Numerous proteins have been identified to be signifi￾cantly associated with the presence and amount of
uraemic CVC in the past (e.g. osteoprotegerin (OPG),
alkaline phosphatase (AP), fetuin-A, matrix-gla protein
(MGP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), C-reactive protein
(CRP)) [4-8], some of which are also associated with
morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients [9-11].
Several of these parameters are also involved in the
regulation of bone metabolism and osseous calcification
processes. Immunohistochemistry examinations of calci￾fied cardiovascular structures showed that some of these
“bone proteins” are deposited adjacent to calcification
nidus indicating an osseous transdifferention of the vas￾cular wall cells [12].

A novel candidate protein for this bone-vascular axis
is sclerostin (22.5 kDa), which is synthesized in osteo￾cytes and is a potent down-regulator of bone metabol￾ism by reducing osteoblast differentiation and function
via canonical Wnt-signalling inhibition [13,14]. High
serum sclerostin was described in patients with CKD
[15]. Recent reports indicated that serum sclerostin
levels may reflect reduced bone metabolism and may be
useful as marker for low-turnover bone disease in ESRD
patient [16]. Therefore, we hypothesized that sclerostin
is also linked to vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
The aim of the present study was to assess whether
CVC in haemodialysis patients is associated with levels
of circulating sclerostin and whether valvular calcifica￾tion goes along with local sclerostin production. We
performed a cross-sectional study among HD patients
who underwent MS-CT scanning for CAC and AVC as￾sessment. Additionally, an ex vivo study with aortic valve
tissue samples was performed in order to analyse local
valvular sclerostin expression in calcified versus non￾calcified aortic valve tissue.
Methods
Patient characteristics
Patients for MSCT calcification assessment were all
chronic HD patients. Standard bicarbonate dialysis pro￾cedures were thrice weekly haemodialysis or haemodia￾filtration sessions (4.5 to 5.5 hrs). Dialysate calcium
concentration was 1.25 or 1.5 mmol/L. All adult
hemodialysis patients from the Aachen University Hos￾pital and three collaborating dialysis centers were eligible
after written and informed consent. Patients were not
included in the study if they anticipated living kidney
donation, had current atrial fibrillation, severe comor￾bidities, a history of coronary bypass surgery, coronary
stent implantation or aortic valve surgery (patient char￾acteristics Table 1) (Figure 1: flow diagram of a detailed
list of inclusion and exclusion criteria). Two patients
underwent MSCT despite prior stent implantation.
These two patients were included only for AVC analysis.
Twenty-one patients had a previous renal transplant￾ation. Median interval between re-initiation of dialysis
after transplant failure prior to cardiac MS-CT was
28 months (range 4 – 63 months). A subgroup of 40 pa￾tients from the entire MS-CT cohort were included in a
previous publication [6]. In the entire cohort of 67 pa￾tients, the dominant causes for ESRD were glomerulo￾nephritis or systemic vasculitis in n = 21 (31%), ADPKD
in n = 9 (13%), renal vascular disease or hypertensive ne￾phropathy in n = 11 (16%) and diabetic nephropathy in
n = 6 (9%). Arterial hypertension was defined as use of
antihypertensive drugs or arterial blood pressure exceed￾ing 130/85 mmHg.
The sclerostin control group consisted of 54 patients
from an internal medicine outpatient department (n = 15
(28%) males, mean age 57.9 ± 9.7 years, eGFR >60 mL/
min (MDRD formula [17])), whose primary reason for
referral was not cardiovascular disease. Those patients
were recruited solely based on the absence of overt CKD
and not matched to the MSCT cohort in terms of age,
sex or underlying extra-renal disease. Within this cohort
a broad spectrum of internal medicine diseases was
present. Presence or absence of cardiovascular calcifica￾tion was not systematically evaluated in this cohort, so
we on purpose avoid the term “healthy” controls.
We performed ex vivo aortic tissue analyses from over￾all 15 consecutive long-term HD patients (10 with AVC,
5 without AVC) who did not participate in the MSCT
study. Mean age of HD patients with AVC was 56 ±
14 years (7 men). Mean age of HD patients with non￾Table 1 Clinical, demographic, and MSCT data of the

calcified aortic valves was 59 ± 9 years (three men). Non￾calcified aortic valves were identified based on negative
routine von Kossa staining. All valves were paraffin em￾bedded prior to IHC staining for sclerostin. The material
was retrieved from the Aachen University Pathology In￾stitute biobank after query for “dialysis and aortic valve”.
Patients with AVC as indicated by positive van Kossa
had undergone aortic valve replacement due to severe
aortic valve stenosis. The patients without AVC on van
Kossa staining had the clinical picture of endocarditis
with aortic regurgitation prior to surgery. Based on these
selection criteria via the pathology biobank, detailed
clinical and laboratory data regarding pre-operative
conditions and history were not available in all these
patients.
This study was approved by the ethical committee of
the RWTH Aachen University Hospital (ethical vote EK
239/11).
CT imaging procedure
All MSCT examinations were performed on a 16-slice
MSCT scanner (SOMATOM, Sensation 16, Siemens,
Forchheim, Germany). Scan parameters included a colli￾mation of 12 × 0.75 mm, a rotation time of 420 ms, a
table feed of 3.4 mm per rotation, a tube voltage of
120 kV and an effective tube current time product of
150 mAseff. For ECG-synchronization, retrospective
ECG gating was applied. Axial images were recon￾structed in mid-diastole at 60% of the RR interval with
an effective slice thickness of 3 mm and a reconstruction
increment of 2 mm. A dedicated convolution kernel
(B35f ), a field of view of 180 × 180 mm2 and a matrix of
512 × 512 were applied. Image analysis was performed
on a separate computer workstation (Leonardo, Siemens,
Forchheim, Germany) equipped with a dedicated soft￾ware tool for calcium scoring (Calcium Scoring CT,
Siemens, Forchheim, Germany). The CT scans started
cranially above the origin of the left main coronary
artery and moved caudally to the level of the diaphragm
to include all three coronary arteries completely.
Complete scanning of the entire aortic arch was not part
of the routine protocol. CAC and AVC scores were
calculated as the primary read-out according to the
method originally described by Agatston et al. [18].
Additionally, the results were expressed as the calcifica￾tion volume score and mass score automatically pro￾vided by the CT-software.
Biochemical analysis
The parameters serum creatinine (S-creatinine), serum
urea, serum phosphorus, total serum calcium (Ca2+),
haemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline
phosphates (AP) and albumin were all measured via
standard laboratory methods. We measured total serum
calcium without correction for albumin.
For centralized laboratory measurements serum was
harvested after an overnight fast after the long dialysis
interval prior to dialysis, according to standard proced￾ure, and immediately frozen (-20°C). Afterwards, sam￾ples were transferred to the University Hospital Aachen

for long-term storage at -80°C. The following parameters
were all measured centrally after study end: undercarbo￾xylated matrix-Gla protein (ucMGP), fetuin-A, osteopro￾tegerin (OPG), sclerostin, bone alkaline phosphatase
(BAP), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH).
UcMGP was measured using a competitive ELISA as
previously described by our group [19].
Commercially available ELISA assays were used to
determine levels of fetuin-A, OPG, and BAP (TECOme￾dical AG, Sissach, Switzerland). PTH was measured as
intact PTH (iPTH) by an assay provided by Biomerica,
USA. Serum sclerostin was assessed by the TECO®
Sclerostin EIA Kit which is a 96-well immuno-capture
ELISA product. Serum samples were incubated with a
biotinylated polyclonal antibody as well as with a horse￾radish peroxidase-labelled secondary monoclonal anti￾body that specifically recognizes human Sclerostin.
Sclerostin molecules are captured on the plate through
the binding of streptavidin to the biotinylated primary
antibody. After an overnight incubation, the unbound
material was washed away. After this washing step, the
TMB substrate, which reacts with the HRP, was added to
the well and colour was formed. After 15 minutes of in￾cubation, the reaction was stopped with HCl and the
plate was read using a plate reader at 450 nm. The
amount of colour generated is directly proportional to
the amount of sclerostin in the sample (intratest variabil￾ity 3.5 – 5.5%).
Analysis of sclerostin expression in aortic valves
After fixation (3.7% formaldehyde, 24 hours) the valves
were paraffin-embedded, cut with a rotating microtome
at 3-μm thickness (Leica), and stained according to rou￾tine histology protocols. Immunohistochemical analysis
was performed using the primary antibody for sclerostin
(rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA, sc-130258). Slide preparations were stained by
using an autostainer for immunohistochemistry (DAKO
cytomation) with the biotinylated secondary antibody
(rabbit/mouse, DAKO), as described previously [20].
Total RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin￾embedded aortic valves using RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). The RNA concentration was deter￾mined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm (Nanodrop,
Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). One microgram
of RNA was reverse transcribed using the high-capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR were carried out
with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosys￾tems). The expression of genes of interest was normal￾ized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The cDNA
of the non-calcified valves from the control patients was
used as a relative standard for the sclerostin expression
and relative gene expression was analysed with the 2-
ΔΔCt method. The following primers were used:
GAPDH Fw 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3′ Rv
5′-TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA-3′, Sclerostin Fw
5′-CCGGTTCATGGTCTTGTTGTT-3′ Rv 5′-ATGCC
ACGGAAATCATCCC-3′.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were done using SAS® statistical software,
V9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Grouping of
patients by the Agatston level was used to describe the
distribution of serum parameters. We expressed con￾tinuous factors as mean values and standard deviation
(SD). Categorical factors were presented by frequencies
and percentage. To characterize the relation between
Agatston level, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were
calculated. Unpaired t-tests were used in order to deter￾mine differences between groups (e.g. patients with high
versus low levels of CVC according to the Agatston level).
In order to investigate the association of various
biomarkers with CAC and AVC, we studied all explora￾tory factors in the first instance in a univariate regres￾sion model for continuous factors or in an ANOVA
model for categorical factors. Factors which showed a P￾value < 0.25 in the univariate analyses were studied sim￾ultaneously in a multivariate model (ANCOVA) to ex￾plore those factors contributing significant information
(P-value falling below the 5% margin) for predicting the
severity of cardiovascular calcification. These analyses
were done for the AVC and CAC expressed as Agatston
score (primary analysis target), and mass score as well as
volume score (secondary analysis targets). Regarding
CAC the multivariate analyses were repeated after log
transformation of CAC levels in those patients with
CAC baseline levels greater than zero (n = 61). Log
transformation was not performed regarding AVC levels
because of the high proportion of patients without AVC
calcification.
Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis of
sclerostin mRNA expression.
All test results are reported as P-values (P), estimates
and corresponding 95% limits of confidence.
Results
Serum sclerostin in patients
In 54 controls serum sclerostin levels were significantly
lower than in HD patients [0.76 ± 0.31 vs 1.53 ± 0.81 ng/
mL (p <0.00019)]. The median (25th to 75th percentile)
levels of sclerostin were 0.69 (0.58 to 0.89) ng/mL in
controls and 1.44 (0.95 to 2.01) ng/mL in patients. In
controls the distribution of sclerostin levels was as fol￾lows: 14% revealed serum sclerostin < 0.50 ng/mL, 72%
between 0.51 to 1.00 ng/mL, and 14% > 1.01 ng/mL. In
hemodialysis patients the distribution was broader and

right-shifted with levels < 0.50 ng/mL in 7%, 0.51 to
1.00 ng/mL in 14%, 1.01 to 1.50 ng/mL in 32%, 1.51 to
2.00 ng/mL in 19%, 2.01 to 2.50 ng/mL in 14% and >
2.51 ng/mL in 14%, respectively.
Distribution of calcification levels for CAC and AVC
There were only 6 patients (9%) without CAC and
40 patients (60%) without detectable AVC. The mean
Agatston CAC score was 647 ± 854 (range 0 – 3736). 23
patients had CAC levels below 100 (35%) and 29 (45%)
showed CAC scores exceeding 400. The mean CAC
mass and volume score were 118 ± 155 and 572 ± 720,
respectively. The mean level of AVC was 76 ± 233 (range
0 – 1596, Agatston score) at baseline. Twelve patients
(18%) showed AVC Agatston score > 100. The mean
AVC mass score was 13 ± 41and the AVC volume score
was 64 ± 194.
Association between CAC and AVC
There was a statistically significant correlation between
CAC and AVC (r = 0.34, p = 0.0055). For patients with
CAC exceeding 100, the AVC Agatston score was not
significantly different from patients with CAC below 100
(104 ± 288 vs 14 ± 35, p = 0.143). Accordingly, patients
positive for AVC at baseline did not have significantly
different CAC scores (870 ± 915 vs 507 ± 794 for patients
with no AV; p = 0.095).
Intergroup comparison between patients with different
levels of calcification
After stratifying the patients for CAC < 100 versus >100,
the group with CAC levels exceeding 100 revealed sig￾nificantly higher levels of OPG: 5.95 ± 2.53 vs 4.13 ± 2.62
pmol/L (P = 0.0133). These severely calcified patients
were also significantly older (64 ± 12 vs 51 ± 16 years;
P = 0.0003) (Table 2). None of the other parameters
listed in Table 2 were significantly different between the
two CAC groups. Patients with CAC Agatston score >
400 revealed OPG levels of 5.81 ± 2.67 (compared to
4.13 ± 2.62 pmol/L, p = 0.02). After stratifying patients
according to presence or absence of AVC, the intergroup
comparison revealed significantly lower sclerostin levels
in patients without AVC (1.35 ± 0.73 vs 1.78 ± 0.84 ng/
mL; P = 0.0311). There were no additional parameters
with significant differences between the two AVC groups
(Table 3).
Association between sclerostin and cardiovascular
calcification
For both CAC and AVC, univariate and multivariate re￾gression analyses were performed.
Depending on the P-values obtained in the univariate
analysis (P ≤0.25 in Table 4), age, male sex, BMI, dia￾betes, OPG, iPTH, and ucMGP were included in the
multivariable analysis for CAC. This multivariable ana￾lysis revealed that the presence of diabetes was signifi￾cantly associated with CAC levels (Table 5, Agatston
score). Similar results regarding the association with dia￾betes were obtained when analysing the volume CAC
score and the mass CAC score (data not shown). The
same model in n = 61 patients was applied after log
transformation of CAC levels with age, male sex, BMI,
calcium, OPG, CRP, and ucMGP entering the multivari￾ate analysis. None of these univariate associations with
log transformed CAC remained statistically significant
after multivariate analysis.
Regarding AVC (Agatston score) the univariate ana￾lysis (Table 6) resulted in inclusion of age, male sex, dia￾betes and serum sclerostin to the multivariable analysis.
There was a significant association between serum
sclerostin and the extent of AVC at baseline (P = 0.0170)
(Table 7). Similar results regarding the association of
serum sclerostin and AVC were obtained when anaylsing
the volume AVC score and the mass AVC score (data
not shown).

valves while there was no sclerostin expression in the
non-calcified control valves (Figure 2). The immunohis￾tochemistry showed a strong sclerostin expression very
close to the calcified regions (Figure 2B-i) but also a
faint sclerostin expression in the non-calcified regions
of the calcified valves from all of the haemodialysis
patients (Figure 2C-i). In contrast, we did not observe
any sclerostin expression in the non-calcified valves
(Figure 2B-ii and C-ii). This finding was confirmed on
the mRNA level via Qt-RT-PCR as we observed a highly
significant upregulation of sclerostin mRNA in the calci￾fied aortic valves of haemodialysis patients compared to
non-calcified control valves (P <0.001) (Figure 2D).
Discussion
The major findings of the present study were that in dia￾lysis patients high serum sclerostin was associated with
the extent of AVC and that in aortic valve tissue,
sclerostin strongly co-localized with areas of calcifica￾tion. In the last decade, numerous studies have investi￾gated cardiovascular calcifications in adult haemodialysis
patients (e.g. [6,21-23]). CVC clearly influences outcome
in ESRD patient since previous studies could show an
independent influence of baseline CVC [24] and its
progression [2] upon mortality in these patients.
Calcification of the aortic valves is an important part of
the uraemic calcification syndrome. It has been previ￾ously shown that in patients without advanced renal fail￾ure there is a significant correlation between the amount
of aortic valve calcification and the degree of aortic valve
stenosis [25].
Previously published studies in dialysis patients regard￾ing the association between various biochemical parame￾ters and the degree of cardiovascular calcification do not
show a homogeneous picture: Numerous circulating fac￾tors have been elaborated on so far as being associated
with CAC or AVC but other studies failed to confirm
these associations [1,6,22,26]. For example, the present
study does not confirm an independent association
between low levels of serum fetuin-A or high levels
of OPG with CAC in contrast to a previous study by
Moe et al. [12]. Our present data also differ from

previous results that indicated a link between ucMGP
levels and CAC in a smaller cohort of HD patients [27].
We can only speculate about the potential reasons. The
different methodology of calcification detection and co￾hort size may play a role. Similarly, different patient
characteristics (ethnic background, proportion of dia￾betics, dialysis vintage etc.) and moreover, preanalytical
biomarker stability and assay characteristics of the inves￾tigated biomarkers clearly influence such associative in￾vestigations. In that respect it is noteworthy that
especially fetuin-A serum measurements reveal mean￾ingful differences depending on analytical procedures
[28] and that previous data from our group indicating a
link between fetuin-A in serum and the magnitude of
VC had not been obtained by the TECOmedical assay
used in the present study. So differences in serum
fetuin-A assay set-ups most likely contribute to incon￾sistencies in terms of associations with the degree of cal￾cification [12]. Similarly we need to point out that also
previously reported serum sclerostin levels vary largely
with different assays in hemodialysis patients: Data from
our lab show a 45% lower circulating sclerostin concen￾tration in hemodialysis patients measured with the
TECOmedical assay compared to the Biomedica assay
(V. Brandenburg, unpublished data).
Despite these limitations regarding biomarkers in
uremic cardiovascular disease we see a convincing ra￾tionale to introduce sclerostin in CKD-mineral and bone
disorder. Sclerostin strongly regulates bone metabolism.
Genetically engineered animal models prove the role of
sclerostin as a bone-suppressive factor [29,30]. Sclerostin
knock-out mice were characterized by increased bone
density and strength. Sclerostin exerts its osteo-suppres￾sive actions via interference with the Wnt -signalling
pathway [31]. The regulation of the Wnt-signalling path￾way may contribute locally and/or systemically to bone
and mineral disorders in CKD [15,32]. Recent study
findings indicate that sclerostin is also involved in vascu￾lar disease. An in vitro and rodent study by Zhu et al.
could show that sclerostin is upregulated in experimen￾tal models of vascular calcification [33]. We extend these
findings for the first time to a potential linkage between
sclerostin levels and AVC in humans with ESRD. The
present data are in line with recent human study results
indicating an association of sclerostin expression with
non-uremic aortic valve calcification [34]. Therefore,
sclerostin appears to be a promising future research tar￾get in CKD-MBD offering potential therapeutic perspec￾tives [29,35].
Our data upon sclerostin expression in the vascular
system stimulate the discussion about osteocyte involve￾ment in vascular and valvular calcification processes. As
previously speculated by Zhu et al. [33] the occurrence
of sclerostin in the vasculature may indicate a terminal
transdifferentiation from VSMCs towards a mature,
osteocyte-like cell type. Zhu and coworkers investigated
various osteocyte markers (e.g. DMP-1 and sclerostin) in
different in vitro and in vivo calcification models. Indeed,
VSMC sclerostin expression was stimulated by incuba￾tion in pro-calcific media and accordingly, sclerostin was
detected in calcified aortas from ectonucleotide pyro
phosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 null mice [33]. More￾over, the different temporal course of osteocytic marker
expression in osteoblasts compared to VSMC indicates
that stimulated osteoblasts undergo this maturation pro￾cess more readily than VSMC [33]. At that point, a crucial
question arises whether local sclerostin production and
systemic levels play a causal role in, or even trigger, the de￾velopment CVC. Alternatively, sclerostin occurrence may
just reflect a general phenotypic change of the vascular
wall cells towards a bone-like phenotype. Most import￾antly, however, future longitudinal studies need to address
the question whether sclerostin overexpression might even
be vasculoprotective and anti-calcific via e.g. its indirect
BMP-2 antagonistic activities.

It remains unclear why there was apparently no associ￾ation between the amount of CAC and serum sclerostin
levels. It is also unclear if the increase of serum
sclerostin may be due to increased skeletal or extra￾osseous production, due to diminished renal clearance
or both. The trial design does not allow drawing reliable
conclusions of how CKD-MBD therapy (dialysis proce￾dure, co-medication) influences sclerostin levels. At
present, the biological meaning of the serum sclerostin
differences between patients with AVC versus those
without remains speculative. In conjunction with a re￾cent publication by our group [34] serum sclerostin
levels as measured with the present ELISA gradually
increase with increasing cardiovascular disease burden:
from controls without overt cardiovascular disease
(0.76 ± 0.31 ng/mL), via non-renal patients with AVC
(0.94 ± 0.45 ng/mL [34]), and via dialysis patients with￾out AVC (1.35 ± 0.73 ng/mL) finally to dialysis patients
Figure 2 Histological and immunohistochemical analyis of calcified and non-calcified valves from dialysis patients. Von Kossa staining
was strongly positive in calcified valves from dialysis patients (Ai) and completely negative in all non-calcified control valves (Aii). Immunhisto￾chemical staining for sclerostin revealed a strong expression in the calcified areas (arrows in Bi, calcification marked with asterisk) and a faint
sclerostin expression in non-calcified areas (Ci, arrows) of the calcified valves from dialysis patients. The immunohistochemistry for sclerostin was
negative in all non-calcified valves (Bii, Cii). Qt-RT PCR for sclerostin expression showed a highly significant upregulation of sclerostin expression
in the calcified valves compared to the non-calcified valves (D). Gene expression in the non-calcified control valves was set as 1. All scale
bars 50 ηm.

with AVC (1.78 ± 0.84 ng/mL). Overall, we are aware that
defining the exact association between serum sclerostin
and CKD-MBD is challenging, and future human scle￾rostin studies in CKD-MBD should incorporate both vas￾cular and osseous assessment [36,37]. The present data do
not allow drawing firm conclusions whether sclerostin is
within the aetiological pathway of uremic AVC develop￾ment and whether baseline sclerostin levels are a risk fac￾tor for future CVC development.
We acknowledge several additional limitations of the
present study including the cross-sectional nature, the
small sample size of the MSCT patient group, the lim￾ited ability to adjust for all potential confounders as well
as limited data availability in terms of treatment and
comorbidities regarding the patients with aortic valve re￾placement. Moreover, we used only one assay type per
parameter limiting the ability to universalize the associa￾tive data between biomarker with vascular calcification.
Conclusion
In summary, we identified an association between both
tissue sclerostin as well as serum sclerostin with aortic
valve calcification in haemodialysis patients. Strength of
our data is the homology between ex vivo (IHC) and
in vivo (MS-CT) data. These findings add novel aspects
to the well-described link between bone metabolism and
cardiovascular health (bone-vascular axis) in uraemia.
Further studies need to address the cellular origin of
local sclerostin production and also investigate whether
the appearance of sclerostin aggravates or rather slows
down cardiovascular calcification processes.
