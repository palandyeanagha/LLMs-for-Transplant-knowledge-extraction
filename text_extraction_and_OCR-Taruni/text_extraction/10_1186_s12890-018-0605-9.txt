Abstract
Background: Bacterial respiratory infections (BRI) are major complications contributing to increased morbidity and
mortality after lung transplantation (LT). This study analyzed epidemiology and outcome of 175 consecutive
patients developing BRI in ICU after LT between 2006 and 2012.
Methods: Three situations were described: colonization determined in donors and recipients, pneumonia and
tracheobronchitis during the first 28 postoperative days. Severity score, demographic, bacteriologic and outcome
data were collected.
Results: 26% of donors and 31% of recipients were colonized. 92% of recipients developed BRI, including at least
one episode of pneumonia in 19% of recipients. Only 21% of recipients developed BRI with an organism cultured
from the donor’s samples, while 40% of recipients developed BRI with their own bacteria cultured before LT. Purulent
sputum appears to be an important factor to discriminate tracheobronchitis from pneumonia. When compared to
patients with tracheobronchitis, those with pneumonia had longer durations of mechanical ventilation (13 [3–27] vs 3
[29], p = 0.0005) and ICU stay (24 [16–34] vs 14 [9-22], p = 0.002). Pneumonia was associated with higher 28-day (11
(32%) vs 9 (7%), p = 0.0004) and one-year mortality rates (21 (61%) vs 24 (19%), p ≤ 0.0001).
Conclusions: These data confirm the high frequency of BRI right from the early postoperative period and the poor
prognosis of pneumonia after LT.

Background
Among the many issues reported in the early postope￾rative phase after lung transplantation (LT), bacterial re￾spiratory infections (BRI) constitute major complications
largely contributing to increased mortality in transplant
recipients [1–6]. The etiologies of these infections are
very diverse, involving community bacteria and hospital￾acquired micro-organisms [4–7]. In a large cohort of
170 patients, Riera et al. recently demonstrated, for the
first time, an increased mortality rate of ventilator￾associated pneumonia (VAP) following LT [1].
Although recent guidelines have defined pneumonia,
tracheobronchitis and colonization after lung and heart
transplantation [8], the distinctions between these entities
are blurred by several confounding factors such as
ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, immunosuppression or
atelectasis [9]. Although a consensus has been reached
concerning the treatment of bacterial pneumonia [8], the
need to extend antibiotic therapy to tracheobronchitis re￾mains controversial. Criteria usually proposed for the
diagnosis of postoperative pneumonia in LT recipients are
difficult to identify, resulting in a high risk of missing
pneumonia in these immunocompromised patients [8].
Our local policy is to initiate antibiotic therapy as soon as

a patient is suspected of having BRI, even in the absence
of criteria of pneumonia.
The aim of the present study was to compare the
characteristics of patients who developed one or more
episodes of BRI during the first 28 days after LT in
ICU with those who did not. The influence of
colonization of the bronchial tree and tracheobronchi￾tis on the development of pneumonia and the role of
these entities on the outcome were also evaluated.
Methods
Study population
Between January 2006 and December 2012, all consecu￾tive adult patients undergoing LT and admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative care for at
least 24 h were retrospectively included in a database.
The study period included the length of ICU stay during
the first 28 days following transplantation. According to
French law, no informed consent was required in view
of the observational and retrospective nature of this
study. The study was approved by the Paris North Hos￾pitals Institutional Review Board (Paris VII University,
AP-HP, IRB No. 00006477).
Perioperative management
Surgical transplantation procedure is standardized
according to our local policy [10, 11]. Perioperative care,
including postoperative management, was standardized
for all patients according to our standard protocol [12].
Immunosuppressive therapy was based on a combin￾ation of prednisolone, ciclosporin and azathioprine
subsequently replaced by mycophenolate mofetil.
In patients without previous colonization of the re￾spiratory tract, perioperative antibacterial prophylaxis
consisted of cefamandole at induction of anesthesia and
continued for 48 h. In patients with preoperative
colonization, prophylaxis was adapted to the micro￾organisms isolated. Our center’s policy does not include
digestive or bronchial decontamination prior to LT.
Microbiologic samples
Respiratory colonization samples were performed in a
large proportion of patients more than 6 months before
transplantation. Respiratory samples are not routinely per￾formed immediately prior to transplantation in our center.
Pretransplant tracheal bacterial colonization was recorded.
Donor airway samples were obtained by bronchial aspiration
during the surgical procedure before transplantation.
During the postoperative period, fiberoptic bronchos￾copy was performed daily with invasive respiratory tract
samples collected by bronchial aspiration (BA) every two
or three days and by bronchoalveolar lavage [13] in the
case of suspected viral or fungal infection. Microbiologic
samples were processed according to the usual
techniques. Susceptibility testing was performed as
previously described [14].
Definitions of BRI
Pneumonia was defined as positive culture of BA
samples yielding ≥105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL
combined with new or persistent lung infiltrate on chest
X-ray, and two or more of the following criteria:
temperature ≥ 38.4 °C or < 36 °C, WBC count >11,000
/mm3 or <4000 /mm3
, at least 30% decrease of PaO2/
FiO2 ratio, and purulent secretions [15]. Tracheobron￾chitis was defined as positive culture of microbiologic
samples, normal appearance or moderate interstitial in￾filtrates on chest X-ray and at least one of the previously
described clinical signs [16]. Colonization was defined
as positive culture of microbiologic samples with no
clinical, laboratory or radiological signs [8].
Antibiotic therapy
According to local policy, all cases of suspected posto￾perative BRI (pneumonia or tracheobronchitis) were
treated by empiric antimicrobial therapy, followed, when
the diagnosis was confirmed, by targeted therapy accor￾ding to susceptibility testing for a total duration of seven
days. Our local empiric antimicrobial therapy consisted
of a combination of cefepime and amikacin.
Data collection
Demographic characteristics, underlying diseases and clin￾ical data were recorded. Severity scores (SOFA and SAPS
II) were assessed on ICU admission. At the time of pulmon￾ary samples, clinical characteristics (purulent secretions,
abundance of secretions, temperature), laboratory parame￾ters (white blood cell (WBC) count, PaO2), chest X-ray im￾aging and results of microbiologic cultures were collected.
Morbidity criteria (ICU length of stay, duration of mechan￾ical ventilation, primary graft dysfunction score) and 28-day
and one-year mortality after LT were assessed [17].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Quantitative variables
are expressed as median and interquartiles (25th–75th
percentiles) and were compared by a nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables are expressed
as proportions and absolute numbers, and were com￾pared by Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. In the
subgroup of patients with BRI, we compared the clinical
presentation, microbiologic data and outcome of
patients with and without criteria of pneumonia. Risk
factors for one-year mortality were analyzed by
univariate analysis. Variables with a p-value< 0.15 on
univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate logistic
regression model. One-year mortality was estimated by
Tanaka et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018) 18:43 Page 2 of 9

the Kaplan-Meier method. A p-value < 0.05 was consi￾dered statistically significant.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Between 2006 and 2012, 175 LT were performed. Demo￾graphic data are presented in Table 1.
One hundred sixty one (92%) patients required
mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay, and 64% of
patients were mechanically ventilated at the time of
diagnosis of BRI. A median of 7 [5–13] BAs were
performed per patient yielding 467 bacteria (Table 2).
During the first 28 days after LT, 161 (92%) patients de￾veloped at least one episode of BRI. A median of 2 [1–3]
episodes of BRI were observed per patient for a total of
380 episodes. In this population, 127 (73%) patients devel￾oped tracheobronchitis with no episode of pneumonia and
34 (19%) patients developed one or more episodes of pneu￾monia. Fourteen (8%) patients did not experience any BRI.
Bacterial colonization
Forty-seven donors and 55 recipients were colonized
before transplantation. Bacterial species involved in
colonization are presented in Table 3.
Twenty-two colonized recipients developed postoperative
BRI with one of their own micro-organisms cultured before
LT (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9), Staphylococcus aureus
(n = 6), Streptococcus spp. (n = 2), Klebsiella spp. (n = 2), En￾terobacter spp. (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Stenotropho￾monas spp. (n = 2) and Achromobacter spp. (n = 1)). Twelve
recipients developed BRI with a micro-organism cultured
from the donor’s samples (Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6),
Streptococcus spp. (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Pseudo￾monas aeruginosa (n = 1), Enterobacter spp. (n = 1) and
Proteus spp. (n = 1)). Data are presented in Fig. 1. Statistical
analysis of bacterial colonization could not be performed
due to missing data.
Tracheobronchitis
Three hundred thirty-eight cases of tracheobronchitis
were observed with a median time to onset of the first
episode of 6 [1–12] days after LT.
Pneumonia following LT
Overall, 42 episodes of pneumonia involving 51 micro￾organisms were diagnosed in 34 patients with a median
time to onset of 5 [1–8] days after LT (Table 1). No
significant microbiologic differences were observed

between the micro-organisms isolated from patients
treated for pneumonia and tracheobronchitis (Table 2).
Pneumonia occurred first in 17/175 patients (10%),
while tracheobronchitis was reported before the onset of
pneumonia in 158/175 (90%) patients. Time to onset of
pneumonia is shown in Fig. 2.
Seven (17%) of the 42 episodes of pneumonia were
caused by micro-organisms initially cultured from tra￾cheobronchitis (Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), Entero￾bacter aerogenes (n = 1), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
(n = 3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Enterococcus
faecium (n = 1), Hafnia alvei (n = 1) and Achromobacter
xyloxidans (n = 1)).
No significant difference in the frequency of pneumo￾nia due to organisms cultured from the host or the
donor was observed between single and double lung
transplantation (4/20 patients versus 5/14 patients,
respectively, p = 0.43).
Clinical characteristics of the patients in the various
subgroups
Apart from age, no significant differences were observed
between patients with and without BRI in terms of
demographic or severity characteristics (Table 1).
No significant demographic differences were observed
patients with pneumonia and patients with tracheobron￾chitis with no episode of pneumonia apart from the need
for ECLS (Table 1), while they presented different clin￾ical features at the time of pulmonary sampling
(Table 4).
Outcome
Patients with at least one episode of pneumonia had
higher 28-day and one-year mortality rates (Fig. 3) and
longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay
than patients with tracheobronchitis without pneumonia
(Table 5).

Univariate and multivariate analyses identified 3 inde￾pendent factors of one-year mortality (Table 6). Pneu￾monia (OR 7.1 [2.7–18.7], p < 0.0001); age > 60 years
(OR 3.0 [1.3–7.3], p = 0.013), and mechanical ventilation
> 14 days (OR 5.1 [2.2–11.8] p < 0.0001) were associated
with a higher one-year mortality rate.
Discussion
This study, based on a large cohort of 175 LT patients,
determined the epidemiology, prognosis and outcome
after BRI in the early postoperative period following LT.
Donor and recipient colonization played a limited role
in the development of BRI. BRI resulted in pneumonia

due to the same micro-organism in 17% of cases. This
study also confirms the poor prognosis of pneumonia
after LT.
Bacterial species/colonization
Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus spp. and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa were the predominant species isolated in our
cohort, in line with other studies analyzing the postoper￾ative period after LT [1, 5, 18].
Only 21% of recipients developed BRI with a micro￾organism cultured from donor samples. The majority of
these pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria (especially
staphylococci and streptococci) and Enterobacteriaceae.
Definition of pneumonia and tracheobronchitis
All patients with a diagnosis of BRI in our center re￾ceived antibiotics adapted to the species cultured. Our
antibiotic policy differs from that described in several
other published studies, in which only patients with
pneumonia were treated by antibiotics [4], resulting in a
lower selection pressure, but an increased risk of under￾treating true pneumonia, and increased mortality rates,
as reported by Iregui et al. [18]. Percentage adequacy in
our population, published in a previous paper, demon￾strated a high rate of MDR bacteria in cases of late
pneumonia [14].
It can be very difficult to distinguish between tracheo￾bronchitis and pneumonia during the postoperative
period following LT. In 2010, the International Society
of Heart and Lung Transplantation Infectious Diseases
Council working group defined proven pneumonia in
cardiothoracic transplant recipients on the basis of clin￾ical, radiologic and laboratory criteria. According to the
authors, this definition applied not only to the early
phase of LT, but also to the subsequent phase. However,
during this crucial LT postoperative period, several
criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia may be difficult
to assess.
We observed the presence of these criteria in both tra￾cheobronchitis and pneumonia. Low rates of fever or
hypothermia can be easily explained by administration
of steroids and immunosuppressive agents. High rates of
leukocytosis/leukopenia are frequently reported in the
LT postoperative period and are not specific to sepsis.

For example, ischemia-reperfusion is an important con￾founding factor, especially during the first five postoper￾ative days [19, 20]. Similarly, the characteristics, changes
and quality of sputum are difficult to assess during the
LT postoperative period. Ischemia-reperfusion syndrome
and fluid administration during and after surgery can
make sputum characteristics difficult to interpret. How￾ever, purulent sputum appeared to be a relevant factor
in our cohort of patients. Cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, or
pleural rub, rales or bronchial breath sounds are also
nonspecific signs and appear to be totally inappropriate
and of limited value during the postoperative period, es￾pecially in ventilated patients. While the PaO2/FiO2 ratio
appears to be a relevant parameter in ICU patients for
the diagnosis of VAP, this criterion can be misleading
after LT due to the presence of ischemia/reperfusion
syndrome, primary graft dysfunction, and atelectasis or
lung collapse. Finally, chest X-ray changes are challen￾ging issues in these patients with ischemia/reperfusion,
pulmonary edema, atelectasis and lung collapse, pleural
effusion or acute rejection. X-ray signs of infiltration
could be a very sensitive criterion for pneumonia in
these patients, but are associated with poor specificity,
as illustrated by the high rate of these signs in patients
with tracheobronchitis.
Links between BRI, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia and
outcome
Riera et al. recently described an increased mortality rate
in patients with postoperative pneumonia after LT [1].
ICU mortality increased to 40% and the in-hospital
mortality rate was 50% in patients who developed post￾operative pneumonia. This finding highlights the severity
of postoperative pneumonia, even when appropriate an￾tibiotics are rapidly prescribed. Although some studies
have not found any link between pneumonia and
mortality [21, 22], mortality rates remain high in this
disease, which can be explained by the severe immuno￾compromised status of these patients, especially during
this early phase of the immunosuppressive protocol,
with potentially limited access of antibiotics to the lung
during this crucial period.
In this context, we compiled all cases of pneumonia in
our cohort according to the definition proposed by Riera
et al. and identified 42 episodes of pneumonia in 34 pa￾tients. As described by Riera et al., the major finding is
that, compared to tracheobronchitis, postoperative
pneumonia is associated with dramatically increased 28-
day (32%) and one-year (61%) mortality.
With a 28-day mortality of 7% and a one-year mor￾tality of 19%, the outcome of patients with tracheobron￾chitis with no episode of pneumonia did not differ from
that reported in other studies conducted during the LT
postoperative period [1, 18]. However, no significant
difference in terms of demographic and microbiologic
data was observed between patients with one or more
episodes of pneumonia and patients with tracheobron￾chitis but no episode of pneumonia. In view of the high
mortality rate in this context, it is essential to rapidly
distinguish between these two entities in order to focus
on patients with pneumonia. Purulent sputum seems to
be a very strong and useful clinical criterion to distin￾guish tracheobronchitis from pneumonia. However, it is
a very subjective decision to note sputum as purulent.
Further studies are required to characterize this group of
patients with poor outcome.
Lastly, only a small proportion of patients (n = 14) did
not develop any form of lung infection during the early
postoperative period. No general characteristics were
identified to differentiate these patients from those with
BRI. However, the mortality rate of this small subset of
patients (21% at 28 day and 42% at one year) remains
high. This high 28-day mortality rate can be explained

by non-infectious causes, such as primary graft dysfunc￾tion or surgical complications, while infectious diseases,
especially late pneumonia, were mainly responsible for
the high one-year mortality rate.
Therapeutic consequences of our findings
The findings of this study cannot be used to determine
whether our local policy to treat all episodes of tracheo￾bronchitis was able to decrease the incidence of early￾onset pneumonia in our population.
Most episodes of pneumonia were due to species unre￾lated to the donor’s or recipient’s colonization flora, as
also observed in other studies in lung transplant cohorts.
For example, in the study by Riera et al. analyzing 170 pa￾tients, most cases of pneumonia were totally independent
of colonization prior to the graft [1]. Riera et al. observed
only 3/20 cases of pneumonia caused by species cultured
prior to the graft. In Riera’s study, gastroparesis was
significantly associated with both pneumonia and
ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis. Although most
emerging organisms were not cultured from the host’s re￾spiratory tract, we cannot exclude a host digestive tract
origin of these bacteria. The gastric reservoir is a well￾known source of contamination, which has led many
teams to propose the use of selective decontamination.
Limitations
Our study presents a number of limitations. Firstly, this
single-center study reflects our local practice and essen￾tially concerned COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) patients. The epidemiologic findings would therefore
probably be different in cystic fibrosis patients. Secondly,
bacterial resistance was not evaluated in this study, but
could be a relevant parameter, especially as all cases of
BRI in our cohort were treated. We have previously re￾ported a progressive increase of resistance rates, which
could be related to our local antibiotic policy [14].
Thirdly, analysis of the inflammatory status was not
included in our decision-making process, which is based
exclusively on microbiologic data. The specific host inflam￾matory response could be an important trigger to stratify
the development of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia. How￾ever, we have previously shown that the early inflammatory
response is a confounding factor for the diagnosis of early
pneumonia [12].
Fourthly, the pathogenic role of enterococci and
coagulase-negative staphylococci (coNS) in pneumonia
remains controversial, at least in immunocompetent
ICU patients [23]. Enterococci and coNS BRI were
treated according to our local rules. However, this policy
is subject to debate and could be considered to be
excessive.
Fifthly, respiratory colonization samples performed in
a large proportion of patients more than 6 months
before transplantation may have been a source of bias.
Information about species during the last 6 months in
our practice might be interesting, especially to determine
the most appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis during the
first 48 h following transplantation.
Lastly, this was a retrospective study and prospective
evaluation of our practice could be a useful approach in
future studies.

Conclusion
In our cohort of immunocompromised patients after LT,
92% of patients developed BRI during the ICU postope￾rative period. Donor and recipient colonization played a
limited role in the development of BRI. It can be difficult
to distinguish between tracheobronchitis or pneumonia
in the early postoperative phase after LT due to major
confounding factors. Finally, our data confirm the poor
prognosis of pneumonia after LT. Pneumonia has a
major impact on mortality, which cannot be explained
by microbiologic or demographic differences.
