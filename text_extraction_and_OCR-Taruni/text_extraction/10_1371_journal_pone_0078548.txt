Abstract
Background: Immigrants have increased mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to the host
populations, primarily due to undetected chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Despite this, there are no
systematic programs in most immigrant-receiving countries to screen for chronic HBV infection and immigrants are
not routinely offered HBV vaccination outside of the universal childhood vaccination program.
Methods and findings: A cost-effective analysis was performed to compare four HBV screening and vaccination
strategies with no intervention in a hypothetical cohort of newly-arriving adult Canadian immigrants. The strategies
considered were a) universal vaccination, b) screening for prior immunity and vaccination, c) chronic HBV screening
and treatment, and d) combined screening for chronic HBV and prior immunity, treatment and vaccination. The
analysis was performed from a societal perspective, using a Markov model. Seroprevalence estimates, annual
transition probabilities, health-care costs (in Canadian dollars), and utilities were obtained from the published
literature. Acute HBV infection, mortality from chronic HBV, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were
modeled over the lifetime of the cohort of immigrants. Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year.
Screening for chronic HBV infection, and offering treatment if indicated, was found to be the most cost-effective
intervention and was estimated to cost $40,880 per additional QALY gained, relative to no intervention. This strategy
was most cost-effective for immigrants < 55 years of age and would cost < $50,000 per additional QALY gained for
immigrants from areas where HBV seroprevalence is ≥ 3%. Strategies that included HBV vaccination were either
prohibitively expensive or dominated by the chronic HBV screening strategy.
Conclusions: Screening for chronic HBV infection from regions where most Canadian immigrants originate, except
for Latin America and the Middle East, was found to be reasonably cost-effective and has the potential to reduce
HBV-associated morbidity and mortality.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important global health
problem. Approximately 350 million people are chronically
infected with the virus worldwide, 25% of whom will die from
long-term sequelae, such as cirrhosis, liver failure and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), resulting in 600,000 to one
million deaths annually [1,2]. Chronic HBV is generally
asymptomatic for the first 30 to 40 years after infection.
Individuals then typically present with symptoms related to
long-term sequelae and generally respond poorly to treatment
[3]. Morbidity and mortality from HBV can be reduced through
screening individuals at risk for chronic HBV infection, and
offering appropriately timed antiviral therapy in those found to
be infected [4]. Furthermore, an effective HBV vaccine to
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78548

protect those who are susceptible to HBV and prevent
transmission has been available since the 1980s [5].
Over the past four decades, the majority of new migrants to
Canada, as well as to most other major immigrant-receiving
countries, have originated from countries with an intermediate
or high prevalence of chronic HBV infection (hepatitis B surface
antigen [HBsAg] seroprevalence ≥ 2%) [6]. Immigrants have
increased mortality from chronic viral hepatitis and from HCC
as compared to the Canadian-born and other native-born
populations in immigrant-receiving countries, likely due to
undetected chronic hepatitis B infection acquired in their
countries of origin [7-14]. As a result, organizations such as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
Canadian Collaboration for Immigrant and Refugee Health
(CCIRH) have recently recommended that 1) immigrants from
areas where HBV prevalence is ≥ 2% be screened for chronic
HBV, and 2) those found susceptible be vaccinated [4,15].
Despite this, there are currently no routine immigrant screening
programs for chronic HBV infection or targeted catch-up
vaccination programs before or after arrival in Canada and
most other host countries [4,15-17]. Previous cost￾effectiveness studies have shown that screening migrants for
HBV was at least moderately cost-effective [18-20]. However,
there were large variations in model assumptions, such as the
timing of screening, age and origins of the target populations,
estimated treatment compliance and economic perspective
used.
To identify the optimal strategy to decrease the burden of
HBV in the immigrant population we conducted a cost￾effectiveness analysis, from a societal perspective, of four HBV
vaccination and screening strategies for a representative
cohort of new adult immigrants upon arrival to Canada, taking
into consideration immigrant’s age and region of origin.
Materials and Methods
Intervention Strategies
A decision-analysis tree, which incorporated Markov
processes to represent the natural history of HBV disease, was
developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 (TreeAge Inc.,
Williamstown, MA) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four
screening and vaccination strategies in an incoming cohort of
new immigrants who were all assumed to be unaware of their
HBV infection status and asymptomatic if chronically infected.
These strategies were compared to the status quo of no
targeted screening or vaccination for new Canadian
immigrants.
The four strategies evaluated in this analysis were. 
a. Universal vaccination: Immigrants are offered the three￾dose vaccine series for HBV, without any serologic testing to
determine who is already infected or immune, during their first
year, after arrival in Canada. Those who are already infected
do not receive any benefit from immunization, regardless if they
complied with the intervention or not, and would proceed
normally through the natural history of HBV disease. Those
who are susceptible will generate protective antibodies
according to their compliance with receiving one, two or three
doses of the vaccine (see Figure 1 in Text S1).
b. Screening for prior immunity and vaccination: Immigrants
are offered serologic testing for only hepatitis B surface
antibody (anti-HBs) to determine who has prior immunity to
HBV. Those found to have no serologic evidence of immunity
are offered the three-dose vaccine series for HBV. Those who
decline serologic testing and those found to be immune are not
offered immunization. Similarly, those who are already
chronically infected and accept the vaccine will receive no
benefit from immunization (see Figure 2 in Text S1).
c. Chronic HBV screening and treatment: Immigrants are
offered serologic testing for chronic HBV only. Those found to
be positive for HBsAg will be referred to visit a liver specialist
for further investigations and to determine the need for antiviral
therapy. If treatment is indicated, then immigrants will be
offered treatment with a first-line nucleoside analogue
[3].Those immigrants who are found not to require antiviral
therapy will be followed up annually to determine if subsequent
treatment is needed (see Figure 3 in Text S1).
d. Combined screening for chronic HBV and prior immunity:
Immigrants are offered serologic testing for both anti-HBs and
HBsAg. As above, those found to be chronically infected are
referred to a liver specialist. Those found to be susceptible are
offered the three-dose vaccination series. Those who decline
initial serologic testing are not offered immunization and are not
referred to a liver specialist (see Figure 4 in Text S1).
Model Structure
The population of interest was a hypothetical cohort of
250,000 new Canadian immigrants, representing the
population of landed immigrants who have settled in Canada
each year during the last decade [21]. For the time horizon,
immigrants were followed until death. At entry, all immigrants
were assumed to be in one of four mutually-exclusive
underlying HBV health states: susceptible, immune, stable
chronic infection or active chronic infection. We assumed that
immigrants were otherwise healthy and did not arrive with
cirrhosis or HCC [18]. After accepting or declining the
intervention being offered during their first year, immigrants
entered the Markov model based on the outcome of the
intervention. For example, those who initially arrived
susceptible and accepted to be vaccinated would enter the
Markov model in the immunized state, if they developed an
immune response to the vaccine. Within the Markov model,
subjects can proceed to develop compensated cirrhosis,
decompensated cirrhosis, HCC, undergo a liver transplant or
hepatectomy, or die from these illnesses or die from other non
HBV-related causes (Figure 1). The annual probabilities of
transitioning between states in the model were obtained from
cohort studies and from other cost-effectiveness analyses and
systematic reviews (see Appendix Table 1 in Text S2). The
model was validated by comparing estimated age-specific HCC
mortality rates with data from the GLOBOCAN cancer registry
(See Appendix Figure 1 in Text S2) [22].
Immigrants who had a stable chronic infection were assumed
not to be candidates for antiviral treatment, as we considered
them to have normal liver enzymes levels with low levels of

circulating HBV DNA, and to be hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)
negative [3]. Immigrants who had an active chronic infection
were assumed to be candidates for antiviral therapy as we
considered them to have elevated liver enzymes, high levels of
circulating HBV DNA, and were HBeAg positive, indicating
active viral replication [23]. This dichotomous classification for
chronic HBV infection was used to simplify the different
combinations of clinical characteristics, such as viral load and
HBeAg status, which guide clinical management of patients
with chronic HBV [3]. Based on the relatively young age that
immigrants develop chronic infections in HBV endemic
countries and the fact that most of these perinatally acquired
chronic infections can remain in an immune-tolerant phase for
over twenty years [24], we assumed that 50% of chronically
infected immigrants would have stable chronic infection and
50% would have active chronic infection upon arrival [20]. This
assumption was varied in a sensitivity analysis to determine
how it would affect our results.
Susceptible individuals can become chronically infected,
after landing in Canada, if they acquire an acute infection and

B infection. Note: Every year individuals can transition to
different health states (straight arrows) or can remain in their
current health state. All health states can transition to an
absorbing death state (not shown). Transitions occur annually
until death. Immigrants enter the model based on their
compliance with one of the interventions being offered.

fail to clear the virus. We assumed that the annual risk of
infection in susceptible adults was 4.8 per 100,000 people
among 30 to 39 year-olds, and 3.1 per 100,000 people among
those ≥ 40 years [25]. We used rates from the general
Canadian population, as incidence rates of acute HBV infection
were unavailable for Canadian immigrants. The rates in the
Canadian population were similar to reported rates in the U.S.
foreign-born population, after accounting for under-reporting
due to the often-asymptomatic nature of acute HBV infections
in adults [26].

We estimated that 5% of adult immigrants who acquire an
acute HBV infection will subsequently develop chronic hepatitis
B [2,27]. All new cases of chronic HBV acquired in adult
immigrants were assumed to be active chronic infections
because most acquired cases in adults are associated with
elevated levels of liver enzymes and circulating viral DNA [24].
Seroprevalence Estimates
To determine the initial proportions of immigrants who
arrived chronically infected or with prior immunity, we used
Figure 4. Variation in the cost-effectiveness of the HBV
screen and treat strategy by immigrant
seroprevalence. Note: The seroprevalence from a recent
systematic review and meta-analysis is shown for the six major
immigrant-source regions to Canada.
doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078548.g004
data from a systematic review and meta-analysis that reported
region of origin-specific HBsAg and anti-HBs seroprevalence
estimates in immigrants and refugees [28]. These
seroprevalence estimates were weighted by the proportion of
Canadian immigrants, arriving between 2001 and 2006, from
each of the same world regions to determine an overall
average HBsAg and anti-HBs seroprevalence estimate for
newly-arriving immigrants in the model [29]. Accordingly, for
our base-case models, we estimated that 6.5% of the
hypothetical immigrant cohort would be chronically infected
upon arrival and 32% would have prior immunity to HBV (see
Appendix Table 1 in Text S2).
Model Assumptions
For each of the strategies involving serologic testing, we
assumed that 70% of the population would accept to be
screened. Similarly, we assumed that 70% would accept the
first dose of the HBV vaccine, if offered, and of these 85% and
then 90% would receive second and third doses, respectively,
given that they received the previous dose. As no empirical
data on compliance with voluntary serologic testing and
vaccination uptake in immigrant populations exists, these
estimates are our own assumptions and we examined the
sensitivity of these, and all other assumptions in our model
(see Sensitivity Analysis below). Vaccine immunogenicity
following each of the three doses was 42.5%, 75% and 90%,
respectively, and was assumed to provide lifelong immunity
[30]. We assumed that acceptance of serologic testing or
immunization was independent of an individual’s initial infection
status. Since chronic HBV is often asymptomatic in adults and
we assumed immigrants were unaware of whether they were
susceptible, immune or infected, this assumption of
independence is valid and is not expected to influence the
validity of our model. To account for screening that occurs

during routine clinical care, rather than during the targeted
public health programs, we assumed that members of the
cohort had a 2% annual probability of being serologically tested
for chronic HBV infection after arriving in Canada.
For those found to be chronically infected after serologic
testing, we assumed that 60% would agree to visit a liver
specialist to assess the need for treatment [19]. If treatment is
indicated because of an active chronic infection, we assumed
that 75% would immediately initiate antiviral therapy. We
assumed that antiviral therapy would reduce the risk of
progressing from active chronic infection to compensated
cirrhosis, HCC or death, by 50% [31].
Direct and Indirect Cost Estimates
All direct and indirect costs were calculated in Canadian
dollars for the year 2011 and are summarized in Appendix
Table 2 (see Text S2). Published costs from previous years
were converted into two thousand and eleven dollars using the
Consumer Price Index for health care goods and services [32].
Our economic evaluation was performed from a societal
perspective and included direct medical costs attributed to
acute and chronic HBV infections and their sequelae, as well
as indirect costs, which included out-of-pocket costs to patients
and their families, such as time taken by family members
during palliative care for hepatocellular carcinoma. Productivity
costs, measured by lost income due to death or disability from
chronic HBV sequelae, were not included in cost-effectiveness
calculations to avoid double counting of the impact of chronic
sequelae already captured by health-state utilities [33].
Program costs related to serologic testing and visits to liver
specialists were obtained from medical payment schedules
from the Quebec and British Columbia ministries of health
[34,35]. Vaccine costs were obtained through personal
correspondence from the Montreal Public Health Department.
Direct and indirect medical costs associated with an acute HBV
episode, including time lost from work for hospital visits and
care were incorporated into the model [36]. We estimated that
the average daily gross wage for an adult immigrant was
$142.50 ($19/hour for 7.5 hours), and that symptomatic acute
infections would result in time off work [37].
Direct health-care costs for chronic HBV and liver disease
sequelae were obtained from a Canadian study that calculated
the expected cost of care for patients with chronic HBV and
resulting complications [38]. Antiviral treatment was assumed
to cost $8,089 per year, which is the average between the
annual cost of Tenofovir and Entecavir, two first-line antiviral
medications for chronic HBV [39].
Health-State Utilities
Chronic HBV infections and the long-term liver diseases that
result from infection have a substantial impact on an
individual’s quality of life. We used utility estimates for chronic
HBV-related health states elicited from uninfected Canadian
respondents to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in
the cost-effectiveness analysis (Appendix Table 3 in Text S2)
[40]. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at an
annual rate of 3% [33].
Cost-Effectiveness Analyses
We first calculated expected costs and quality-adjusted
survival for each strategy. Strategies were compared by
calculating their incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER),
which is defined as the additional health benefit of an
intervention, measured in QALYs gained, with the next least
costly undominated strategy [41]. Strategies costing < $50,000
per additional QALY gained were considered to be cost￾effective. Base-case analyses assumed all cohort members
were 30 years old and the underlying HBV seroprevalence was
6.5%.
Sensitivity Analysis
We examined how ICERs for the strategies varied by
considering cohorts with different seroprevalence levels and
age structures, including one with the same age distribution as
current immigrants to Canada. One-way and two-way
sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how key
assumptions regarding compliance estimates and cost
parameters influenced base-case results. One-way sensitivity
analyses were represented with a tornado diagram which
shows how our base-case estimates for ICERs would change
as a single parameter is varied. We conducted a two-way
sensitivity analysis for treatment cost and treatment efficacy to
examine how our estimates would change if newer, more
effective, or inexpensive antivirals were utilized. A probabilistic
sensitivity analysis (PSA), using 10,000 Monte Carlo
simulations, was conducted to simultaneously assess
uncertainty around all key parameters [42,43]. Transition
probabilities and compliance estimates for the PSA were
assumed to follow a beta distribution and costs followed a
gamma distribution [44]. Results from the PSA were assessed
with a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, which shows the
probability that a strategy is cost-effective given several ICER
thresholds.
Results
Base-Case Analysis
In the base-case analysis, screening for chronic HBV and
offering appropriately timed antiviral treatment was the most
cost-effective strategy (Table 1 and Figure 2). The incremental
cost per additional QALY gained for this strategy compared to
no intervention was $40,880. The combined chronic HBV
screening and vaccination strategy was estimated to cost
$437,335 for each additional QALY gained compared to
chronic HBV screening alone. Both strategies involving
vaccination alone, with or without prior serologic testing for
immunity, were dominated by the HBV screening and treatment
strategies, as the former strategies cost more and yielded
fewer QALYs than the no intervention strategy. When we
considered a cohort which had a similar age-distribution as a
cohort of new Canadian immigrants, the ICER comparing the
screen and treat strategy to no intervention increased slightly to
$43,590 per QALY gained (Table 1). As in the base-case
analysis, both vaccination only strategies were dominated,
while the screen, treat and vaccination strategy was
prohibitively expensive.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78548

The cost-effectiveness of the screen and treat strategy
decreased as cohort age was increased in the model (Figure
3). The ICER comparing the HBV screen and treatment
strategy to no targeted intervention exceeded $50,000 per
additional QALY gained for new Canadian immigrants aged 55
years old and older. Screening newly arriving immigrants from
regions where the seroprevalence of chronic HBV infection was
greater than 3% was found to be cost-effective, using this
same threshold (Figure 4). For immigrants from low HBV
endemic areas (HBsAg seroprevalence < 2%), such as Latin
America and the Middle East, the screen and treat strategy
was estimated to cost approximately $64,000 per additional
QALY gained relative to the no intervention strategy. For
immigrants from intermediate HBV endemic areas (HBsAg 2%
to 8%), such as South Asia and Eastern Europe, the screen
and treat strategy was estimate to cost less than $43,000 per
additional QALY gained, and for highly HBV endemic areas
(HBsAg > 8%), such sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, the
same strategy was estimated to cost less than $37,000 per
additional QALY gained. The screen and treat strategy
dominated the vaccination only, as well as the screen and
vaccinate strategy, at every modeled seroprevalence level and
age group.
Other Sensitivity Analyses
The chronic HBV screening and treatment strategy remained
the most cost-effective strategy in all one-way sensitivity
analyses. The results of multiple one-way sensitivity analyses
are summarized in Figure 5. Notably, the ICER for the HBV
screening and treatment strategy increased from $37,728 to
$48,343 when the estimate of the proportion of immigrants with
stable chronic infection decreased from 70% to 30%. Results
were sensitive to the proportion of immigrants complying with
the various components of the interventions, although none of
the model assumptions had a major impact on the main
findings reported above. Specifically the cost-effectiveness of
the HBV screening and treatment strategy increased as the
proportion of those with chronic infection visited a specialist,
accepted or complied with treatment.
Results were sensitive to the cost of antiviral therapy and
treatment efficacy. In a two-way sensitivity analysis of the
screen and treat strategy, it was found that the incremental
cost per additional QALY gained exceeded $50,000 when the
cost of treatment was ≥ $10,000 per year, using the base-case
treatment efficacy of 50% (Figure 6). If treatment efficacy
increased to 75%, this strategy remained relatively cost￾effective, even at very high treatment costs. The probabilistic
sensitivity analysis produced no change in the ranking of
strategies and did not substantially change the ICER estimates.
At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained,
the chronic HBV screening strategy had a 78% chance of being
the most cost-effective strategy (See Appendix Figure 2 in Text
S2). At a threshold of $80,000 per QALY gained, it was found
that the chronic HBV screening strategy had a 99% chance of
being the most cost-effective.
Discussion
The results of our study suggest that targeted screening of
immigrants for chronic HBV infection, followed by appropriately
timed antiviral therapy is the most cost-effective option to
decrease HBV-associated morbidity and mortality in
immigrants. From a societal perspective, it was estimated that
this intervention would cost $40,880 per additional QALY
gained as compared to no intervention in Canada. The cost￾effectiveness of screening for chronic infection remained <
$50,000 per additional QALY gained when HBV
seroprevalence was as low as 3%. The CDC and the CCIRH
have recently recommended HBV screening for all immigrants
from countries where the HBV prevalence is ≥ 2% which would
include all world regions with the exception of most countries in

sensitivity analysis.

Screening and Vaccination of Canadian Immigrants

Latin America, the Middle East and Western Europe [4,15]. Our
results support this recommendation given that immigrants
from all other world regions have a mean seroprevalence of ≥
2% [28]. Although our findings differ slightly from the
recommendations made by the CDC and the CCIRH, the
benefits of screening an entire cohort of immigrants for chronic
HBV infection is, nonetheless, substantial. Furthermore, our
model estimates that the targeted screening program for
chronic HBV infection in all immigrants upon arrival would
results in an additional 1,675 productive life-years gained for
every 250,000 immigrants screened, relative to no target
screening. As a result, the findings of this cost-effectiveness
analysis strongly support the public health recommendations
made by the CDC and the CCIRH [4,15].
The benefit of screening for chronic HBV in immigrants is
that it identifies individuals with asymptomatic chronic HBV
infection acquired in their countries of origin, who, if left
undetected are at increased risk of progression to HBV-related
sequelae, such as liver cirrhosis and HCC. With the timely
identification and treatment of infected individuals the risk of
developing these long-term sequelae can be reduced [23].
Each case of compensated cirrhosis and HCC costs the
Canadian health-care system more than $9,000 and $15,000
per person every year, respectively. Although interventions that
involved immunization have the potential to eliminate future
HBV infections, they were dominated by those strategies that
involved screening for chronic infection. This is due to the large
costs associated with vaccinating an entire cohort, relative to
the small absolute decrease in morbidity and mortality that
would occur from preventing sequelae from a small number of
new chronic infections that actually develop in the adult
population. Immunizing adult immigrants has less of an impact
than vaccinating children, since only approximately 5% of
adults develop chronic infection after an acute episode,
whereas this risk is as high as 90% in the neonatal period and
25-50% in young children [45]. Furthermore, vaccination
interventions have no effect on reducing morbidity and mortality
among individuals already chronically infected with HBV.
There have been three previous cost-effectiveness analyses
that have addressed HBV screening or vaccination in
immigrant populations [18-20]. Hutton et al. found that
screening people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent would
be cost-effective ($36,000 per additional QALY gained [2006
$USD]), compared to no screening and would reduce HBV￾related mortality by 10% [18]. This study, however, only
considered Asian Americans, which are only one high-risk
immigrant group for liver disease and did not include indirect
medical costs in their analysis. Veldhuijzen et al. found that a
one-time screening program for immigrants to the Netherlands
would be cost-effective (€9,000 per additional QALY gained
[2008 €EUR]). This study considered varying levels of
compliance with the intervention, but examined only direct
medical costs and did not examine the sensitivity of their
estimates with respect to age and seroprevalence level [19].
Wong et al. examined the cost-effectiveness of screening all
Canadian immigrants for HBV and found it to be moderately
cost-effective ($45,000 per additional QALY gained), although
they assumed 100% compliance with the screening
intervention [20]. The results of the present cost-effectiveness
analysis, which estimated that screening new Canadian
immigrants would cost $40,880 per additional QALY gained,
are similar to the results obtained by Hutton et al. and agree in
general with the results in the other two analyses. Our analysis
adds to the previous published cost-effectiveness study by
estimating the cost-effectiveness of HBV prevention strategies
from a societal perspective, which included indirect costs, as
well as a calculation of the seroprevalence threshold of chronic
HBV infection above which it is worthwhile to perform HBV
screening in immigrants.
In our study, we used a simplified model of the natural
history of HBV, which did not account for HBeAg status, HBV
DNA viral load, or alanine aminotransferase levels as in two
earlier studies [20,46]. Instead, we partitioned chronic infection
into stable and active chronic HBV states. Both our simpler
approach, and the more elaborate classification scheme used
previously, estimate that approximately 50% of immigrants
diagnosed with chronic HBV infection are eligible for treatment.
We made several assumptions regarding compliance with
screening, vaccine uptake, specialist visits, and treatment
recommendations, in the absence of clinical or epidemiologic
studies documenting these parameters in immigrant
populations. However, our estimates for these parameters
were similar to those used in the Netherlands [19]. Our results
also demonstrated that the analysis was sensitive to
compliance with serologic testing, vaccination, antiviral therapy
and follow-up visits to a liver specialist highlighting certain
factors that need to be carefully considered when developing
and assessing HBV screening and vaccination programs in this
population [47].
The challenges of implementing a widespread HBV
screening program have been highlighted in the recent U.S.
Institute of Medicine Report addressing prevention and control
of hepatitis B and C [48]. Barriers to screening are a
particularly important issue and include lack of knowledge and
awareness about HBV infection and screening among patients,
health care and social service providers and policy makers. It
has been recommended that culturally sensitive outreach
programs that promote awareness about hepatitis B infection in
the community, as well as the potential benefits of screening
and vaccination strategies, be integrated with health-care
services that serve immigrant populations [49].
In Canada, it is estimated that less than 50% of immigrants
have undergone HBV screening [16]. Similarly, the United
States has reported low rates of HBV screening and vaccine
uptake in immigrant populations, particularly among Asian and
Pacific Islanders [50-52]. There is presently no program of
routine health-care for adult immigrants after arrival in Canada
and therefore broad-based community screening of all
immigrants would require new infrastructure as well as
educational efforts targeting both immigrants and health care
providers for the need for HBV screening. A review of
screening programs in the United States identified several
community screening programs serving foreign-born
populations, which were also providers of immunization,
education and specialist referrals for the population served
[53], however they were primarily community-based and were

unable to screen a large number of high-risk immigrants.
Screening at the time of arrival, when immigrants first come
into contact with the health-care system may overcome some
of these barriers, however programs to screen the large
number of immigrants at risk for chronic HBV still need to be
developed.
Conclusions
Screening for chronic HBV in adult immigrants soon after
arrival was found to be reasonably cost-effective, particularly in
younger immigrants and those from most intermediate and also
high HBV-endemic countries. To ensure immigrants will benefit
from these study results, policy makers need to be made aware
of the importance of developing targeted programs to screen
for chronic HBV and clinicians and immigrants need to be
educated about the importance of screening for this virus.
Introduction of targeted HBV screening for all immigrants has
the potential to substantially reduce HBV-associated morbidity
and mortality in this population.
