Introduction
Glomeruli are highly specialized filtration barriers
between the blood and urinary space. Each day, approx￾imately 180 l of blood passes through these filters in
the average adult human kidney. Although water and
small solutes must pass freely through this barrier, crit￾ical blood proteins such as albumin and blood clotting
factors must not. The filter has a number of unique
characteristics that provide the essential properties for
this renal filtration process and include highly special￾ized glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes), a
fenestrated glomerular capillary endothelial system,
and intervening glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) that is produced by both the podocytes and the
endothelial cells (1, 2) (Figure 1a). This filtration barri￾er is the target of injury and ultimate scarring in a wide
variety of kidney diseases (3–8).
During glomerular development, the podocytes
express numerous vascular growth factors such as
VEGF-A, while the glomerular endothelial cells express
the VEGF receptors fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1) and fms￾like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1) (9). In addition, the
podocytes are geographically situated at the develop￾ing vascular cleft adjacent to incoming endothelial cells
(2, 10) (Figure 1b). The location and gene expression
profile of podocytes suggests that they are required to
provide migratory cues to glomerular endothelial cells
to establish the renal filtration barrier. Furthermore,
similar to other fenestrated vascular beds in the body,
podocytes continue to express VEGF-A in the mature
glomerulus. This suggests that VEGF plays a role in
maintaining the filtration barrier either through sur￾vival, proliferation, and/or differentiation cues to the
adjacent specialized endothelia.
It is clear that VEGF is a critical mediator of vasculo￾genesis as heterozygous and homozygous null VEGF-A
mice die with major vascular defects at 11.5 and 9.5 days
after coitus, respectively (11, 12). However, its later role
in specific vascular beds, such as the glomerulus, is less
clear. Although dysregulation of VEGF-A expression

Kidney disease affects over 20 million people in the United States alone. Although the causes of renal
failure are diverse, the glomerular filtration barrier is often the target of injury. Dysregulation of
VEGF expression within the glomerulus has been demonstrated in a wide range of primary and
acquired renal diseases, although the significance of these changes is unknown. In the glomerulus,
VEGF-A is highly expressed in podocytes that make up a major portion of the barrier between the
blood and urinary spaces. In this paper, we show that glomerular-selective deletion or overexpression
of VEGF-A leads to glomerular disease in mice. Podocyte-specific heterozygosity for VEGF-A result￾ed in renal disease by 2.5 weeks of age, characterized by proteinuria and endotheliosis, the renal lesion
seen in preeclampsia. Homozygous deletion of VEGF-A in glomeruli resulted in perinatal lethality.
Mutant kidneys failed to develop a filtration barrier due to defects in endothelial cell migration, dif￾ferentiation, and survival. In contrast, podocyte-specific overexpression of the VEGF-164 isoform led
to a striking collapsing glomerulopathy, the lesion seen in HIV-associated nephropathy. Our data
demonstrate that tight regulation of VEGF-A signaling is critical for establishment and maintenance
of the glomerular filtration barrier and strongly supports a pivotal role for VEGF-A in renal disease.

has been demonstrated in a number of renal diseases,
the significance of these changes is presently unknown.
To determine the role of VEGF-A in the glomerular
filtration barrier, we generated mice with gain or loss
of function of VEGF specifically in the podocyte,
thus avoiding the embryo-lethal effects. The distinct
glomerular-specific haploinsufficient and null phe￾notypes observed in this study demonstrate for the
first time that the “dose” of VEGF is critical in the
establishment and maintenance of later vascular
beds, as it is in vascular formation during earlier
stages of embryogenesis.
By 2.5 weeks of age, mice with podocyte-specific het￾erozygosity for VEGF developed endotheliosis and
“bloodless glomeruli,” the renal lesion seen in
preeclampsia, which progressed to nephrotic syn￾drome, a common glomerular syndrome seen in
humans (13), and end-stage kidney failure by 9–12
weeks. The podocyte-specific homozygotes died at
birth or within 18 hours of birth with hydrops (gener￾alized swelling), kidney failure, and grossly abnormal
glomeruli that lack mature endothelial cells. In con￾trast, overexpression of the 164 isoform of VEGF-A in
podocytes also led to end-stage renal failure due to a
collapsing glomerulopathy, which is the pathologic
lesion seen in HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)
(14). This demonstrates that there is an ongoing
requirement for tight regulation of VEGF signaling
between the podocyte and glomerular endothelium;
disruption in this regulation leads to dramatic and dis￾tinct renal phenotypes that are determined by the
glomerular VEGF dose and suggests that VEGF is piv￾otal in a wide variety of renal diseases.
Methods
Cell-specific gene targeting. Three independent podocyte￾specific Cre recombinase murine lines, A15, GG8, and
V9, which all demonstrated 100% excision when
crossed to the Z/EG reporter mouse strain (15), were
bred to the floxed VEGF-A mouse (Figure 1c). The
VEGF-A mouse has loxP sites inserted around the third
exon (16). Site-specific recombination between the loxP
sites of the VEGF gene results in a null VEGF allele (16).
To generate homozygous floxed VEGF–Cre recombi￾nase mice, bitransgenic mice carrying both a nephrin￾Cre transgene and one floxed VEGF-A allele were bred
to homozygous floxed VEGF-A mice.
To generate transgenic founders that overexpress the
164 isoform of VEGF-A, a 645-bp fragment of the
VEGF gene, including a Kozak consensus sequence
(nucleotides 78–669 of GenBank accession no.
NM009505) and initiating ATG, were subcloned into
the XhoI and XbaI sites of a pNXRS vector between a
4.125-kb 5′ fragment of the murine nephrin gene that
is capable of podocyte-specific expression in vivo in the
kidney (17) and a 0.97-kb poly(A) signal from the SV40
polyoma virus (Figure 1e).
Genotyping. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse
tails as described. The nephrin-Cre transgenic mice
were generated and genotyped as previously described
(17). Floxed VEGF mice were received from Napoleone
Ferrara (Genentech Inc.). Presence of the floxed VEGF
gene was detected by PCR using the oligonucleotide
primers muVEGF 419.F (5′-CCTGGCCCTCAAGTACAC￾CTT-3′) and muVEGF 567.R (5′-TCCGTACGACG￾CATTTCTAG-3′) (both from Sigma-Genosys, The Wood￾lands, Texas, USA), which generate a 148-bp fragment
of the VEGF allele in the presence of the loxP-1 site and
a DNA fragment that is approximately 40 bp shorter
than for the wild-type allele (16).
To identify founder mouse lines that carried the
nephrin-VEGF-164 transgene, Southern blot analysis
was performed. Briefly, the DNA was digested with
EcoRI; the probe used was the 645-bp fragment encod￾ing the VEGF-164 cDNA that recognized a 1.3-kb
genomic fragment in the transgenic founders. To esti￾mate transgene copy number, 1 µg, 2 µg, and 5 µg of
genomic DNA from the transgenic founder or wild-type
mice was blotted on Biodyne B membrane (P/N 60207,
Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)
and hybridized with the VEGF cDNA probe described
above. The signal was quantified using the Quantity
One quantitation software program (4.2.1 version) (Bio￾Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Phenotypic analysis. Urine was collected passively in
an Eppendorf tube from 0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-week-old
mice. A urine dipstick (Chemstrip 5L; Roche Diag￾nostics Corp., Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) was used
to detect the presence or absence of protein and red
blood cells in the urine. The standard colorimetric
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In addition, 2 µl of urine from trans￾genic or control mice was placed in 18 µl of Laemmli
buffer (18), boiled, and loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE
gel. An SDS-PAGE low-range protein standard (Bio￾Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, California, USA) was
loaded in the first lane of the gel.
Blood samples were taken with a heparinized capil￾lary tube by femoral vein stab after warming. A total of
120 µl of blood was collected and creatinine, urea, and
blood chemistry measurements were recorded using a
Stat Profile M7 (Nova Biomedical Corp., Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA). The CBC (total blood count) was
performed on a Coulter Counter (AcT diff; Beckman
Coulter Canada, Ontario, Canada).
Histologic analysis. Embryonic tissues for histologic
analysis were dissected, fixed in 10% formalin/PBS, and
embedded in paraffin. Sections 4 µm thick were cut.
Sections were stained with H&E, examined, and pho￾tographed with a DC200 Leica camera and Leica
DMLB microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Deerfield,
Illinois, USA). Tissue for electron microscopy was fixed
in 1.5% glutaraldehyde, embedded in Spurr (Canemco
Inc., Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada), and sectioned.
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Kidneys
were dissected from mice on postnatal day 0 and at 1
week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, or 9 weeks of age. Kidneys were
708 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 2003 | Volume 111 | Number 5

washed briefly in RNase-free PBS and fixed overnight
in DEPC-treated 4% paraformaldehyde. These tissues
were then placed in 30% sucrose for 12–24 hours,
embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT 4583 compound (Saku￾ra Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, California, USA) and
snap frozen. Ten-micron tissue samples were cut on a
Leica Jung cryostat (model CM3050; Leica Microsys￾tems Inc.) and transferred to Superfrost microscope
slides (Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
USA). The slides were stored at –20°C until needed.
Digoxigenin-labeled probes were prepared according
to the Roche Molecular Biochemicals protocol (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany).
Probes used for in situ analysis were nephrin (19),
Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1; a kind gift of J.
Kreidberg, Children’s Hospital, Boston, Massachu￾setts, USA), podocin (a kind gift from C. Antignac,
Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médi￾cale, Paris, France), α-smooth muscle actin (VSMA; a
kind gift from P. Igarashi, Southwestern University,
Dallas, Texas, USA), VEGF-A (kind gift of A. Nagy,
Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Cana￾da). Details of the in situ analysis protocol may be
obtained upon request.
Immunostaining was performed with antibodies to
WT1 and PECAM as described (20).
Results
Mice that are heterozygous for VEGF-A in the podocyte develop
endotheliosis and nephrotic syndrome. To determine whether
there is any phenotype resulting from a reduction in
VEGF-A gene dose within the podocyte, we used the
Cre-loxP system. Nephrin–Cre recombinase mice were
generated in our laboratory and are capable of site-spe￾cific recombination in 100% of podocytes at the capil￾lary-loop stage in vivo (17). We generated mice that were
heterozygous for the floxed VEGF-A allele and carried
the nephrin-Cre transgene VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/–

the VEGF receptors migrate into the vascular (Vasc) cleft and differentiate in direct apposition to podocytes. In the mature glomerulus, the
fenestrated endothelial capillary loops (cap) remain in intimate contact with the VEGF-expressing podocytes (po). Mesangial cells (me) pro￾vide support to the capillary tuft. Urine is formed as blood (bl) is filtered from the capillaries, across the GBM, and through slit diaphragms
that connect adjacent podocyte foot processes (fp). (c) Scheme to generate heterozygous and homozygous podocyte-specific VEGF knock￾out mice. Triangles are 34 bp loxP sites. (d) The Cre recombinase transgene was identified as a 300 bp PCR product. The floxed VEGF allele

(Figure 1, c and d). They were born in the expected
mendelian frequency but developed end-stage kidney
failure by 9–12 weeks of age.
Physical examination of mice at this stage showed
that 30/30 of the VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/– mice had
lethargy and decreased skin turgor. Urinalysis was per￾formed and showed 3.0 g/l of protein (defined as
“nephrotic range” proteinuria) and 250 red blood
cells/µl of urine by dipstick analysis. SDS-PAGE analy￾sis demonstrated massive albuminuria in all of these
VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/– mice (Figure 2a), which is
pathognomonic for damage to the filtration barrier.
Blood chemistry showed mice to have severely decreased
renal function with an elevated serum creatinine that
measured 200 µM, more than ten times the normal
value, markedly elevated urea, and a normochromic,
normocytic anemia consistent with end-stage kidney
failure (Figure 2b). Of note, fragmentation of red blood
cells was not observed on the blood smear. The mice did
not demonstrate any gross signs of renal
failure prior to 7–8 weeks of age.
At 9 weeks of age, the kidneys were pale
and shrunken (Figure 2c). By light
microscopy, the glomeruli looked histo￾logically normal at birth and at 1, 3, and 6
weeks of age. However, by 9 weeks of age,
the glomerular tufts were retracted with
expansion of the mesangial matrix and
were surrounded by podocytes containing
large empty cytoplasmic vacuoles. The
tubules were packed with protein (Figure
2e and data not shown).
Serial transmission EM studies demon￾strated that the first detectable lesion
occurred at 2.5 weeks of age with swelling
of the endothelial cells (endotheliosis) and
hyaline deposits (Figure 3a) that resemble
the pathologic lesions seen in renal biop￾sies from patients with preeclampsia, a
common disease of pregnancy (21). At this
time, the podocytes and endothelial cells
appeared ultrastructurally normal with
well-formed foot processes and fenestra￾tions, respectively. By 6.5 weeks of age, the
GBM was expanded and endothelial fenes￾trations could no longer be identified (Fig￾ure 3b). By 9 weeks of age, the endothelial
cells were necrotic and no podocyte foot
processes could be identified (Figure 3b).
Molecular marker analysis confirmed the
disappearance of differentiated podocytes
with a complete absence of WT1, nephrin,
and VEGF-A in the majority of glomeruli
of terminally ill mice (Figure 4, g and h, and
data not shown). On occasion, a single cell
could be identified that stained positively
for these markers (Figure 4h). These mark￾ers were all present at birth and at 3 and 6
weeks of age (Figure 4, d–f and data not
shown). The level of VEGF-A mRNA was consistently
lower in the heterozygous VEGF glomeruli than in con￾trol glomeruli at the same developmental stage (Figure
4d). VSMA is not normally found in 9-week-old mesan￾gial cells unless they are “activated” in glomerular
injury; in the heterozygotes, occasional VSMA-positive
cells were identified in the glomeruli (Figure 4i).
VEGF-A is required in the podocyte to establish the glomeru￾lar filtration barrier. In order to investigate the pheno￾type resulting from a complete absence of VEGF-A in
the glomerulus, mice that were null for VEGF-A specif￾ically in the podocyte (VEGF-loxP+/+,Neph-Cre+/– mice)
were generated (n = 15). These mice were born at the
expected mendelian frequency but died at birth or
within 18 hours of birth. Some of these mice were born
with hydrops that can be seen in infants with congeni￾tal nephrotic syndrome (22).
Light microscopy demonstrated that all of the null
VEGF-A glomeruli were small with no or few distin￾710 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 2003 | Volume 111 | Number 5

albumin measuring 66.2 kDa is identified in the sick mouse and demonstrates dam￾age to the kidney filter. In contrast, low–molecular-weight proteins, which are nor￾mally found in mouse urine, are not different.

guishable glomerular capillary loops. Additionally,
podocytes were present but tended to pile up in sever￾al layers and lacked well-formed slit diaphragms, the
specialized intercellular junctions found between foot
processes (Figure 5a and data not shown).
Immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody to
PECAM that recognizes a cell surface receptor on
endothelial cells was performed. Although endothe￾lial cells were present in most immature glomeruli,
they were markedly reduced in number and mature
glomeruli lacked endothelial cells altogether (Figure
5b). BrdU labeling was performed; labeled endothelial
cells were easily identified in the vascular clefts of
wild-type S-shape stage glomeruli but were never
observed in podocyte-specific VEGF-A null glomeruli
(data not shown).
EM studies demonstrated widespread but not com￾plete effacement of podocyte foot processes (not
shown). Small capillary loops with a GBM could be
identified in some glomeruli. However, this GBM failed

podocyte foot processes can be identified.

Neph-Cre+/– control mouse demonstrate expression of VEGF-A and WT1 in podocytes, while VSMA is expressed in mesangial cells, which are
found inside the glomerulus and are required to support the capillary structure. (d–f) At birth (P0), capillary loop–stage glomeruli from a het￾erozygous VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/– mouse demonstrate normal levels of expression of WT1 and VSMA, while VEGF expression is consistently
reduced at the mRNA level compared with the wild-type controls. (g–i) By 9 weeks of age, the heterozygous VEGF mice are clinically unwell. At
this time, most glomeruli demonstrate a complete absence of markers of podocyte differentiation (i.e., no VEGF or WT1; both are absent). In
h, a single WT1-positive cell can be identified (arrow). (i) VSMA is not usually present in glomeruli at 9 weeks; however, occasional VSMA-pos￾itive cells can also be identified and likely represent “activated” mesangial cells (arrow). (j–l) In the null VEGF-loxP+/+,Neph-Cre+/– glomeruli at
birth, no VEGF is seen in glomeruli as predicted due to podocyte-specific excision of both VEGF alleles. WT1 is present in differentiated podocytes.
In contrast, VSMA is absent, demonstrating a defect in migration and/or differentiation of mesangial cells into the glomerulus. (m–o) In the
nephrin–VEGF-164 mouse, both VEGF and WT1 are expressed in podocytes present within collapsed glomeruli. VEGF is markedly upregulated.
In addition, VSMA and mesangial cells are present but appear to surround the collapsed glomerulus in a crescent shape. Magnification: ×350.

to fuse (data not shown). Endothelial cells were seen
only rarely in capillary loop glomeruli and always lacked
fenestrations (Figure 5c). In contrast, fenestrations were
easily observed in endothelial cells of capillary
loop–stage wild-type glomeruli (Figure 5c). Capillary
loops in fully differentiated (mature) glomeruli demon￾strated an absence of endothelial cells (Figure 5c).
In situ analysis showed that the podocytes that were
present expressed markers of differentiation appropri￾ately, including WT1 (Figure 4k), nephrin, and podocin
(data not shown), although VEGF-A was absent due to
genomic excision of the VEGF gene (Figure 4j). Of note,
VSMA, a marker for mesangial cells, was absent from
mutant glomeruli, although some desmin staining
could be identified (Figure 4l and data not shown).
Upregulation of VEGF-A in podocytes leads to a collapsing
glomerulopathy and death at 5 days of age. Given the dis￾tinct phenotypes observed when the dosage of VEGF is
reduced by excising one or both alleles from the
podocyte, we next sought to determine the effect of
increasing the level of VEGF within the podocyte and
its effect on the adjacent endothelium. Transgenic
founder lines that overexpressed the 164 isoform of
VEGF-A (nephrin–VEGF-164) under regulation of a
4.125-kb podocyte-specific promoter from the murine
nephrin gene (Figure 1e) were identified by Southern
blot analysis (Figure 1f). Two independent founder
mice were used for analysis. By dot blot analysis, each
of these founder mice demonstrated a 30-fold increase
in the VEGF copy number (Figure 1g).
The transgenic mice appeared normal at birth but
became growth-retarded within 2 days. By 5 days of age,
the mice were clinically unwell and demonstrated albu￾minuria by dipstick analysis.
Grossly, the kidneys appeared normal in size, were
hyperemic, and demonstrated cortical hemorrhages
(Figure 6, a and b). Light microscopy showed global
collapse of the glomerular tuft and dilation of proxi￾mal tubules that were packed with protein (Figure 6d
and data not shown). Complete collapse of the capil￾lary loops was illustrated by silver methenamine stain￾ing that recognizes the GBM (Figure 6f).
The few visible patent capillary loops were larger in
diameter (Figure 6h) and multiple endothelial cell
nuclei were visible within them (Figure 6, h and j) that
were not seen in wild-type glomeruli (Figure 6, g and i).
Although multiple endothelial cell nuclei could be
identified within the few remaining patent glomerular
capillary loops by EM, virtually all of the loops were col￾lapsed and no endothelial cells could be identified. In
addition, podocytes were abnormal and could be seen
detaching from the GBM (data not shown).
In situ analysis confirmed that the majority of cells
within the collapsed tufts were podocytes that contin￾ued to express WT1 (Figure 4n) and nephrin (not
shown) and very high levels of VEGF-A that were upreg￾ulated five- to tenfold (Figure 4m and data not shown).
Although mesangial cells were present as indicated by
the presence of VSMA (Figure 4o), they were situated in
a crescent shape at the periphery of the glomerulus.
Discussion
VEGF-A is a critical mediator of angiogenesis and vas￾culogenesis (11); both heterozygous and homozygous

knockout mice die during embryogenesis due to major
vascular defects. This demonstrates a dosage sensitivi￾ty for VEGF during development in the whole embryo
(11). Other studies have shown that VEGF-A is required
for the establishment and maintenance of endothelial
fenestrae in vitro (23, 24).
Given the expression pattern of VEGF-A in develop￾ing and mature podocytes, which are located in direct
apposition to fenestrated endothelial cells, and the fact
that VEGF-A expression is associated with a variety of
renal diseases, we hypothesized that VEGF-A is required
in developing podocytes to establish and maintain the
filtration barrier. To test this hypothesis, we used the
Cre-loxP system to manipulate levels of VEGF-A expres￾sion specifically within the podocyte. The mice devel￾oped distinct haploinsufficient, null, and overexpres￾sion phenotypes. Thus, similar to vascular development
in the early embryo, tight regulation of VEGF signaling
is essential in the establishment of later vascular beds
such as the glomerulus. In addition, sequential reduc￾tion in VEGF-A levels led to a loss of fenestrations or
failure of fenestrations to form, definitively demon￾strating for the first time a role for VEGF-A in mainte￾nance of endothelial fenestrations in vivo. Finally, the
distinct and dramatic renal phenotypes observed with
each alteration of VEGF level suggest that VEGF sig￾naling is pivotal in glomerular health and establish its
role in the pathogenesis of glomerular disease.
Complete loss of VEGF-A in the glomerulus was
100% fatal in the perinatal period. The null VEGF￾loxP+/+,Neph-Cre+/– mice died within 18 hours of birth
with generalized swelling (hydrops) and a failure of the
glomerular filtration barrier to form. Although occa￾sional endothelial cells were identified in most but not
all capillary loop–stage (immature) glomeruli, all of
these endothelial cells lacked fenestrations. Upon
glomerular maturation, no endothelial cells remained.
The variability in this phenotype is likely due to the
time of genomic excision of the VEGF-A floxed allele.
VEGF starts to be expressed during the S-shape stage
of glomerulogenesis, whereas nephrin-Cre–mediated
excision takes place slightly later during the capillary
loop stage (17). Thus it appears that transient expres￾sion of VEGF is sufficient to direct a reduced number
of incoming endothelial cells but insufficient to main￾tain survival and proliferation of these cells. In addi￾tion, our results suggest that there is a threshold level
required for VEGF to establish fenestrations that is not
reached in VEGF-null glomeruli. VSMA, a marker of
glomerular mesangial cells during glomerular devel￾opment, was also absent from null glomeruli, demon￾strating that mesangial cell differentiation and/or

migration is dependent upon successful establishment
of a glomerular capillary system.
In contrast, initial development of the glomerular fil￾tration barrier was unaffected in the heterozygous
VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/– mice. However, by 2.5 weeks of
age, marked swelling of the glomerular endothelial cells
led to the appearance of bloodless glomeruli and
endotheliosis, the pathognomonic lesion seen in
preeclampsia. Although preeclampsia is a common and
potentially fatal disease that affects 7–8% of all preg￾nancies, the pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly
understood. Patients typically develop proteinuria, and
renal biopsies performed early in the disease demon￾strate endotheliosis that progresses to glomeruloscle￾rosis in a subset of patients (21). By 9 weeks of age, all
of the podocyte-specific VEGF heterozygotes developed
end-stage kidney failure due to a severe form of
glomerulosclerosis with loss of differentiated
podocytes and endothelial cells. Although alterations
in circulating levels of VEGF have been implicated in
preeclampsia (25), the significance of these changes is
unknown and has not been studied in tissues of affect￾ed organs such as the kidney. Our results suggest that
downregulation of VEGF signaling within the
glomerulus may be involved in the renal lesion of
preeclampsia. Because the primary defect in preeclamp￾sia is believed to lie in the placenta and/or trophoblast,
it is interesting to speculate that some as-yet-unidenti￾fied factor that is generated by the placenta leads to
downregulation of VEGF-A expression within the
glomerulus and endotheliosis, and suggests future
areas of potential investigation.
Although glomerular defects were not observed prior
to 2.5 weeks of age, it is quite possible that earlier
endothelial and/or podocyte defects exist that we were
unable to detect. Furthermore, the dramatic loss of
podocytes by 9 weeks of age suggests that upon stimu￾lation with VEGF-A, endothelial cells “signal back” to
the podocyte, and that endothelial cell damage disrupts
these reciprocal signals, emphasizing the importance
and dependence of reciprocal interactions between
these two cell types.
In addition to its paracrine role in the glomerulus, it
is possible that VEGF-A has an autocrine function that
is required for podocyte survival. Presently, it is con￾troversial whether Flk1 is expressed even at low levels
in podocytes. However, we have crossed our nephrin–
Cre recombinase mice with floxed Flk1 mice (a kind
gift of J. Rossant’s lab at The Samuel Lunenfeld
Research Institute). By 4 weeks of age, these mice have
no phenotype that demonstrates an absence of
Flk1–dependent autocrine signaling within the
podocyte. VEGF-A is required for breast cancer cell sur￾vival in vitro; in this setting, VEGF-A appears to signal
in an autocrine fashion through the VEGF coreceptor,
neuropilin-1, in the absence of Flk1 (26). As neuropilin-1
is expressed in the podocyte, additional studies that
target neuropilin-1 in the podocyte are required to
definitively answer this question.
Previous studies that have globally reduced the
expression of VEGF-A in the mouse by using neutral￾izing antibodies (16, 27) or expressing only the 120 iso￾form of VEGF-A (28) have reported glomerular defects
that are different from those seen in our study. The
intraperitoneal injection of neutralizing antibodies to
human recombinant VEGF in postnatal day 1–3 mice
led to mesangiolysis and an arrest in postnatal kidney
development. Similarly, the postnatal administration
of a soluble chimeric VEGF receptor (Flt1) led to
hypocellular glomeruli with mesangial deposits and
mesangial cell vacuolization (16). In addition, the
authors observed a decrease in the number of glomeru￾lar capillaries and fewer endothelial cell fenestrations
(16). In the developing kidney, VEGF-A is expressed
both in podocytes and in tubular epithelial cells and
adjacent metanephric mesenchymal cells (29). The dif￾ferences seen between previous studies and the present
one are most likely due to alteration of VEGF levels in
multiple cell populations within the kidney and to a
variable reduction of the VEGF dose, which may be
more difficult to control with a circulating antibody or
receptor. In addition, endogenous VEGF-A levels were
upregulated in podocytes in a study by Kitamoto et al.
(27). In our model, there is a complete absence of VEGF
in podocytes. The glomerular phenotype was more
severe in our null mice than in mice treated with block￾ing antibodies or the soluble Flt receptor, suggesting
that the localized delivery of VEGF from the podocyte
across the heparan sulfate–rich GBM to the VEGF
receptors that face the GBM (30) is critical for its func￾tion in vivo.
More recently, Carmeliet and colleagues have report￾ed that mice that express only the secreted 120 isoform
of VEGF-A develop glomerulosclerosis by 6 weeks of
age (28). Although endothelial cells are lost, the
podocytes are reportedly normal. In our experiments,
all isoforms of VEGF-A are lost from the kidney and
the phenotype differs from the VEGF-120 mice.
Together, these results clearly emphasize the impor￾tance of isoform-specific functions of VEGF-A within
the glomerulus. Genomic targeting experiments that
will address the role of the different VEGF isoforms
within the podocyte are underway.
Given the exquisite sensitivity to VEGF dosage
reduction in glomerular development and function,
we also sought to determine the phenotype resulting
from overexpression of the 164 isoform of VEGF-A
specifically in the podocyte. The 164 isoform is secret￾ed and bound by heparan sulfate in the GBM. These
transgenic mice developed a dramatic glomerular phe￾notype and rapidly succumbed to end-stage renal fail￾ure. At the time of death, the majority of their
glomeruli demonstrated global collapse of the tuft as
seen in collapsing glomerulopathy and HIVAN (14).
Why do the capillaries collapse? At birth and from 1–5
days of age, the glomeruli are present and filter urine.
At this time, the patent glomerular capillary loops
have greater diameters and a greater number of

endothelial cell nuclei than do wild-type capillaries.
Other studies have shown that treatment of endothe￾lial cells with increasing doses of VEGF-A leads to coa￾lescence of endothelial cells and the formation of larg￾er endothelial tubes, a process that has been termed
“hyperfusion” (31, 32). In the absence of increased
glomerular capillary flow, this would lead to a fall in
intraluminal capillary pressure and collapse. Of clini￾cal relevance, the tat protein from HIV has been shown
to signal through Flk1 in endothelial cells in Kaposi
sarcoma (33–35), and the podocyte has been identified
as a reservoir for the HIV virus (36). Taken together,
these results present a possible explanation for the
similarity between the capillary collapse seen in the
VEGF-A overexpression model and HIVAN.
It has been hypothesized that damage to the
podocyte ultimately leads to the capillary collapse
seen in HIVAN and other forms of collapsing
glomerulopathies (37–40). However, our results
demonstrate that capillary collapse can occur in the
absence of dedifferentiation or dysregulation of
podocytes. In fact, the capillaries also collapse in het￾erozygous VEGF-loxP+/–,Neph-Cre+/– mice after the
endothelial cells are lost, and in this case, the differ￾entiated podocytes are lost. Thus, it is evident that a
single mechanism or phenotype cannot explain all
cases of capillary collapse in glomerular disease.
In summary, our results demonstrate an exquisite
dosage sensitivity for VEGF-A in the developing
glomerulus. Numerous clinical studies have docu￾mented that alterations in glomerular VEGF-A expres￾sion are associated with glomerular disease (41–44).
Our results demonstrate that dysregulation of VEGF￾A is not only associated with but also plays a patho￾genic role in initiating glomerular injury. The Cre-loxP
system and transgenic approach allowed us to engineer
mice with three different doses of VEGF within the
podocyte based on the allele copy number. Each VEGF
level was associated with a distinct mechanism that led
to one of three important glomerular phenotypes.
These results provide insight into the molecular mech￾anisms that underlie a variety of common and clinical￾ly important human diseases, including preeclampsia
and HIV, and suggest potential future avenues for ther￾apeutic intervention. In addition, it is clear that inter￾actions between podocytes and endothelial cells are
critical during development of the glomerular filtra￾tion barrier and continue in the filtering glomerulus.
Finally, these results provide a note of caution for
clinical trials aimed at altering VEGF levels. Although
the podocyte has not been specifically targeted in these
therapies, careful monitoring of renal function with a
particular emphasis on the glomerular filtration barri￾er should be included in the clinical protocols.
