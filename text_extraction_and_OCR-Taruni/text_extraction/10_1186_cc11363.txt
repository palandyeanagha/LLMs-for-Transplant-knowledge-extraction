Abstract
Introduction: Regional citrate anticoagulation is safe, feasible and increasingly used in critically ill patients on
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, in patients with hepatic or multi-organ dysfunction, citrate
accumulation may lead to an imbalance of calcium homeostasis. The study aimed at evaluating the incidence and
prognostic relevance of an increased total to ionized calcium ratio (T/I Ca2+ ratio) and its association to hepatic
dysfunction.
Methods: We performed a prospective observational study on n = 208 critically ill patients with acute kidney injury
(AKI) and necessity for CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (CRRT-citrate) between September 2009 and
September 2011. Critical illness was estimated by Simplified Acute Physiology Score II; hepatic function was
measured with indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate. After achieving a steady state of calcium
homeostasis patients were classified into tertiles according to the T/I Ca2+ ratio (<2.0 versus 2.0 - 2.39 versus ≥2.4).
Results: The T/I Ca2+ ratio was determined as an independent predictor for 28-day mortality in critically ill patients
with AKI on CRRT-citrate confirmed by receiver operating characteristics and multivariate analysis (Area under the
curve 0.94 ± 0.02; p<0.001). A T/I Ca2+ ratio ≥2.4 independently predicted a 33.5-fold (p<0.001) increase in 28-day
mortality-rate. There was a significant correlation between the T/I Ca2+ ratio and the hepatic clearance (p<0.001)
and the severity of critical illness (p<0.001). The efficacy and safety of citrate anticoagulation, determined by blood
urea nitrogen, mean filter patency and bleeding episodes, were not significantly different between the tertiles.
Conclusions: In patients on CRRT-citrate T/I Ca2+ ratio is closely related to the clinical outcome and emerged as an
independent predictor of 28-day mortality. Larger studies are required to define the cut-off and predictive value for
the T/I Ca2+ ratio. This ratio is associated with hepatic and/or multi-organ dysfunction and therefore an important
therapeutic target.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has an incidence of 30% in
intensive care units (ICUs) [1] and most frequently
occurs in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
[2,3]. Even though available studies do not demonstrate
a reduction in mortality under continuous renal replace￾ment therapy (CRRT) compared with intermittent
hemodialysis [4,5], CRRT has some advantages like slow
and balanced fluid removal leading to minimal variabil￾ity of plasma osmolality and electrolyte disturbances
with better cardiovascular and hemodynamic tolerability
[6]. The main disadvantage of CRRT is the requirement
for anticoagulation to prevent clotting of the extracor￾poreal circuit, and severe bleeding has been reported in
up to 30% of these patients, with heparin being the
most commonly used anticoagulant [7,8].
Regional citrate anticoagulation is an effective and safe
alternative to heparin [7,9-11]. Citrate is infused into the
extracorporeal circuit and chelates ionized calcium,
thereby inhibiting coagulation. Citrate and chelated

calcium enter the dialysate and are removed from the
hemocircuit with calcium chloride (CaCl2) infused sys￾temically, replacing the losses of calcium. Citrate not
dialyzed through the filters enters the systemic circula￾tion of the patient and is metabolized to bicarbonate
mainly by the liver. Non-metabolized citrate chelates
ionized calcium, leading to a decrease in its concentra￾tions [11-14]. CaCl2 is continuously administered to
achieve a steady state between citrate administration by
central infusion and citrate elimination determined by
liver metabolism. Once a steady-state citrate concentra￾tion is achieved, a normal ionized calcium concentration
can be achieved by an increased total calcium concen￾tration because a fraction of the ionized calcium is che￾lated by circulating systemic citrate. The total-to-ionized
calcium ratio (T/I Ca2+ ratio) should be directly propor￾tional to the concentration of serum citrate [15,16].
Therefore, impaired hepatic citrate metabolism leads to
citrate accumulation and increases T/I Ca2+ ratio with
normal ionized calcium [13]. Thus, citrate accumulation
is indicated indirectly by an elevated T/I Ca2+ ratio.
Patients with hepatic or multi-organ dysfunction (or
both) can develop citrate accumulation characterized by
low ionized calcium, elevated total calcium, and meta￾bolic acidosis [12,13]. In critically ill patients undergoing
CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (CRRT￾citrate), an increased T/I Ca2+ ratio in about 33% of
patients with severe hepatic impairment was found [13].
We prospectively evaluated the incidence and prognostic
relevance of an increased T/I Ca2+ ratio and its associa￾tion to hepatic and multi-organ dysfunction in all
patients undergoing CRRT-citrate in a medical ICU
within a 2-year period.
Materials and methods
Patients
With approval of the institutional review board (Ethical
Committee of the Saarland, Germany, 211/11), we eval￾uated all critically ill patients with AKI and necessity for
CRRT in the medical ICU of the University Hospital of
Saarland from September 2009 to September 2011.
Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled
patients or substitute decision makers. Critical illness
was defined by a commonly used score in intensive care
medicine (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, or SAPS
II) [17]. Thus, critical illness and MODS were defined as
a minimum SAPS II of 30 points. As shown in Figure 1,
in our center, all patients with AKI and necessity for
CRRT were assigned to regional citrate anticoagulation
(CRRT-citrate). A steady state of calcium homeostasis
was defined when a stable T/I Ca2+ ratio after at least
36 hours of CRRT was achieved and when no changes
in the infusion rates of CaCl2 or citrate were necessary
in the previous 36 hours. The primary endpoint was 28-
day mortality. Secondary endpoints were changes in
liver function and calcium homeostasis during citrate
anticoagulation.
According to the American College of Chest Physi￾cians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [18,19],
in all patients on CRRT-citrate, unfractioned heparin
(UFH) was given as an adjunctive in a thromboembolic
prophylactic dose regimen (300 to 500 IU/hour intrave￾nously). In cases of the demand for systemic effective
anticoagulation (for example, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart
valves, and decompensated heart failure), UFH was
given in a therapeutic dosage. During the study period,
in 11 patients (1.5%), a heparin-induced thrombocytope￾nia was diagnosed. These patients on CRRT-citrate were
additionally treated with argatroban in therapeutic
doses.
Safety
Patients underwent physical examination, hemodynamic
measurements (blood pressure and heart rate), and clini￾cal laboratory tests daily. Bleeding episodes were classi￾fied according to the modified McMaster criteria [20].
The episodes were defined as minor when bleeding
signs occurred but no transfusion was needed and as
major when transfusion of blood or coagulation factors
became necessary.
Continuous renal replacement therapy protocol
Vascular access for CRRT was established through a
double-lumen central venous catheter. Continuous
venovenous hemodialysis was performed with a polysul￾fone high-flux hemodialyzer by using a Fresenius multi￾filtrate (Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) with a
bicarbonate dialysate at a flow rate of 2,000 mL/hour.
The blood flow was 100 mL/minute. The ultrafiltration
rate depended on clinical requirements (0 to 200 mL/
hour). The hemodialysis tubes and filters were renewed
every 72 hours. We used regional anticoagulation with
4% trisodium citrate solution (Fresenius), which was
administered in the extracorporeal circuit before the site
of the hemofilter. We started with a standard dose of 4
mmol/L citrate/blood. In most patients, only minor cor￾rections in this dosing were necessary (3.5 to 4.2 mmol/
L) to achieve calcium levels of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L in
the blood of the extracorporeal circuit. On average, 4
mmol/L citrate/blood flow was used. The postfilter
CaCl2 replacement was accomplished by CaCl2 infusion
given via a central line before reinfusion of blood into
the patient. Citrate and CaCl2 infusions were adjusted
by the nursing team in accordance with the protocol of
the manufacturer (Fresenius). The target level of intra￾corporeal ionized systemic calcium was between 0.9 and
1.2 mmol/L.

In cases (n = 16) of an increasing T/I Ca2+ ratio of at
least 2.4, which is an indirect sign of citrate accumula￾tion, the dialysate flow was elevated up to 3,000 mL/
hour in order to increase the citrate clearance. In two of
these cases, as increasing dialysate flow was not efficient
enough to reduce the ratio, blood flow was reduced to
80 mL/hour in order to reduce citrate offer for
anticoagulation.
Laboratory tests
Ionized postfilter extracorporeal calcium and ionized
systemic calcium were measured initially every 20 min￾utes until a steady state was achieved and then every 4
hours. Sodium, potassium, and arterial blood gases were
analyzed every 4 hours. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red
and white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, urea, total
calcium, chloride, total bilirubin, albumin, cholinester￾ase, prothrombin time, antithrombin III, and transami￾nases were measured daily.
Assessment of hepatic function
Transaminases, total bilirubin, albumin, cholinesterase,
prothrombin time, and antithrombin III were measured
daily. In patients with signs of progressive hepatic
impairment and threatening hepatic failure, liver func￾tion was evaluated to avoid overdosage of administered

therapeutics. For dynamic liver function, indocyanine
green (ICG-PULSION; Pulsion Medical Systems,
Munich, Germany) was injected in the central venous
catheter (0.5 mg/kg). ICG is nearly exclusively elimi￾nated by the liver unconjugatedly into the bile and does
not undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Its elimination
may be expressed as the plasma disappearance rate
(ICG-PDR) and can be measured non-invasively at the
bedside by transcutaneous pulse densitometry with a
finger clip (LiMON monitoring; Pulsion Medical Sys￾tems). Normal values for ICG-PDR are considered to be
more than 18% per minute. In general, ICG removal
from the blood depends on liver blood flow, parenchy￾mal cellular function, and biliary excretion [21-23]. ICG￾PDR measurements were made once daily.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean value ± standard error of
the mean unless otherwise stated. All quantitative para￾meters were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test). Correlations of biomarkers were done by Pearson
correlation coefficient. For quantitative data, we used
one-way analysis of variance to compare three groups
(T/I Ca2+ ratio of less than 2.00, 2.00 to 2.39, and 2.40
or more) with Bonferroni post hoc test. Dependencies in
contingency tables (categorical data) were analyzed with
chi-squared test. Some biomarkers were used as diag￾nostic tests. The cutoff points were determined by the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Survival
curves were created by using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was per￾formed to determine predictor variables for 28-day sur￾vival. All statistical analyses were performed with
StatView (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
This prospective monocentric clinical study was per￾formed at an interdisciplinary medical ICU. During a
study period of 2 years, AKI was diagnosed in 233 of 923
critically ill patients (25.24%). In all 233 cases, CRRT￾citrate was performed. A steady state of calcium homeos￾tasis was defined when no changes in the infusion rates
of CaCl2 or citrate were necessary within 36 hours. Con￾secutively, 208 patients (89.3%) were analyzed (Figure 1)
and were distributed into three groups by tertiles of T/I
Ca2+ ratio (less than 2.00, 2.00 to 2.39, and 2.40 or more).
The main demographic data are presented in Table 1.
Among these three groups, there were no differences in
age, gender, reasons for MODS and AKI, any history of
kidney disease, and severity of critical illness as measured
by SAPS II. In the highest calcium ratio tertile, patients
with a history of liver disease were significantly cumu￾lated (7.7% versus 6.7% versus 24.5%, P = 0.003).
Laboratory parameters at the start, day 3, and last day of
CRRT are depicted in Table 2.
Outcomes
Higher T/I Ca2+ ratio was associated with a significant
increase in 28-day mortality (4.6% versus 38.9% versus
100%, P <0.001) (Table 1). Cox regression analysis,
including age, gender, heart rate, mean arterial blood
pressure, bilirubin, albumin, cholinesterase acticity,
prothrombin time index, ICG clearance, acid-base bal￾ance, and total and ionized calcium levels and their
ratio, was performed. Only albumin (P <0.001), ICG
clearance (P <0.001), and total and ionized calcium
levels (P <0.001) and their ratio (P <0.004) were signif￾icant independent predictors for 28-day mortality.
ROC analysis, calculating the area under the curve
(AUC), showed a high accuracy in predicting mortality
for the T/I Ca2+ ratio (AUC of 0.938 ± 0.02, P <0.001)
at day 3. This accuracy was as high as the predictabil￾ity of the well-established ICG clearance (AUC of
0.941 ± 0.02, P <0.001) (Figure 2). In ROC analysis, a
cutoff for the T/I Ca2+ ratio of at least 2.4 had a prog￾nostic sensitivity of 55.6% (95% confidence interval
(CI) 44.7% to 66.0%) and a specificity of 99.2% (95% CI
95.4% to 99.9%) to determine 28-day mortality. In the
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with a ratio of
at least 2.4 had the highest mortality rates (Figure 3a:
baseline; Figure 3b: levels on day 3). The log-rank tests
for all of these survival curves were significantly differ￾ent (P <0.001). The hazard ratio for mortality was
33.5-fold higher for a T/I Ca2+ ratio of at least 2.4
than for a ratio of less than 2.4 (Table 3).
Total-to-ionized calcium ratio and hepatic or multi-organ
dysfunction or both
None of the patients on CRRT-citrate developed rele￾vant signs of hypo- or hypercalcemia, chloride overload
because of CaCl2 infusion, or any signs of citrate toxi￾city. Mean pH values, carbon dioxide partial pressure
(pCO2), and bicarbonate levels remained in a normal
range during the whole study period (Table 2). Never￾theless, according to the distribution of patients in the
predefined T/I Ca2+ ratio tertiles after achieving a steady
state of calcium homeostasis after 72 hours, total cal￾cium concentrations and T/I Ca2+ ratios were already
elevated at baseline in tertile 3 (P <0.001) (Table 2).
Patients in tertile 3 were associated with a significantly
decreased hepatic clearance, measured by the ICG-PDR.
This contrasted to patients in tertiles 1 and 2 in whom
hepatic clearance increased significantly (P <0.001)
(Table 2). Strikingly, according to the duration of CRRT
(baseline, day 3, and last day), T/I Ca2+ ratios and ICG￾PDR clearances had a strong inverse correlation (r2 =
0.42, P <0.001) (Figure 4a). From the static liver

function parameters, bilirubin trended toward higher
levels and prothrombin time index was significantly
reduced (P <0.001) in tertile 3, whereas albumin and
cholinesterasis did not differ significantly between the
tertiles. Thus, monitoring of liver enzymes and hepatic
protein synthesis is not sensitive enough to detect func￾tional metabolic hepatic impairment. Within the T/I
Ca2+ ratio tertiles, the severity of critical illness changed.
Although SAPS II decreased in tertiles 1 and 2, we
observed a time-dependent significant increase of SAPS
II in tertile 3 (P <0.001) (Table 2). We found a signifi￾cant correlation between the T/I Ca2+ ratios and the
SAPS II (r2 = 0.42, P <0.001) (Figure 4b).
Dialysis therapy, efficacy, and safety
CRRT-citrate was performed with a blood flow of 100
mL/hour, a dialysate flow of 2,000 mL/hour, and a dialy￾sis dose (adjusted by patient weight) of 25 ± 0.2 versus
26 ± 0.2 versus 25 ± 0.3 mL/kg per hour (P = 0.483)

T/I Ca2+ ratio of at least 2.4, dialysate flow was raised
up to 3,000 mL/hour in order to increase the citrate
clearance; if necessary, as a second step, blood flow was
raised down to 80 mL/hour in order to reduce citrate
offer for anticoagulation. These procedures were effec￾tive, avoiding a further increase of T/I Ca2+ ratio and
citrate accumulation. CRRT-citrate was effective for all
patient groups, as evidenced by the average fall in urea,
blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine (P <0.001) (Table 2).
After achieving a steady state and comparing these para￾meters on the last day of therapy, they did not differ sig￾nificantly. The hemodialysis tubes and filters were
renewed every 67 ± 0.7 versus 69 ± 0.6 versus 67 ± 0.8
hours (P = 0.136) (Table 1). Fifty-five filters (5.3%) were
substituted because of technical problems and vascular
access malfunction. No patient developed severe
bleeding.
Discussion
CRRT-citrate is effective and safe, particularly in criti￾cally ill patients with elevated bleeding risks [7,9,10,24].
In cases of hepatic or multi-organ dysfunction or both,
citrate metabolism can be impaired, resulting in citrate
accumulation detected indirectly by an elevated T/I Ca2
+ ratio [9,13]. So far, the incidence and prognostic rele￾vance of an elevated T/I Ca2+ ratio on CRRT-citrate
patients remain unclear. We prospectively evaluated the
prognostic relevance of the T/I Ca2+ ratio in all critically
ill patients with AKI undergoing CRRT-citrate in a med￾ical ICU within a 2-year period. We demonstrate, for
the first time, that the T/I Ca2+ ratio (a) emerged as an
independent predictor of 28-day mortality in critically ill
patients on CRRT-citrate and was associated (b) with
hepatic impairment and (c) with multi-organ
dysfunction.
Monitoring the T/I Ca2+ ratio in patients on CRRT￾citrate is an easy procedure with high therapeutic and
prognostic impact. As shown in our study, measuring of
total and ionized calcium levels and calculating their
ratio provided independent predictors for 28-day mor￾tality in patients on CRRT-citrate. A T/I Ca2+ ratio of at
least 2.4 had a prognostic sensitivity of 55.6% and a spe￾cificity of 99.2% to determine 28-day mortality. In the
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with a ratio of
at least 2.4 had the highest mortality rates; in these
patients, the risk to die was 33.5-fold higher than in
patients with a ratio of less than 2.4. Larger studies may
be required to define the cutoff point with the greatest
diagnostic and prognostic efficiency more precisely.
It remains unclear whether changes in calcium home￾ostasis are only markers of critical illness and comorbid￾ity or whether they independently contribute to

mortality. First of all, ionized calcium levels remained
within the normal range by continuous CaCl2 infusion
and are unlikely to influence patient outcomes. Further￾more, serum chloride levels were not changed. Only
extreme abnormalities of ionized calcium were reported
to be independent predictors of mortality [25,26]. Sec￾ond, total calcium levels were increased in cases of
citrate accumulation caused by hepatic or multi-organ
dysfunction or both. In acute stressor states, increased
total calcium levels cause a shift of calcium from the
circulating pool to intracellular compartments and
facilitate an intracellular calcium overload [27], inducing
oxidative stress, permeability, and apoptotic cell death
[26]. Furthermore, calcium administration increased
mortality in animal models of sepsis [28,29].
Therefore, therapeutic strategies target the early detec￾tion of either elevated total calcium levels or elevated T/
I Ca2+ ratio caused by citrate accumulation in patients
on CRRT-citrate. Citrate levels could be decreased by
increasing citrate clearance through the use of a higher
dialysate flow, by reducing the blood flow (resulting in a
reduced need for citrate anticoagulation), or by reducing

the citrate offer in the extracorporeal circuit. Under
these strategies, the use of a higher dialysate flow (2,000
to 3,000 mL/hour) is associated with increased diffusion
mechanisms and is very effective in citrate clearance
[30]. Reducing blood flow by 20% (from 100 to 80 mL/
hour) is associated with a decreased need of citrate for
anticoagulation, but its effectiveness in lowering citrate
levels is less compared with increasing dialysate flow
[30]. Lowering citrate offer by reducing the citrate dose
(3.5 to 4.2 mmoL/L) in the extracorporeal circuit is
associated with an increased risk for coagulopathy and
is recommended only in selected patients according to
safety and filter patency criteria.
In critically ill patients on CRRT-citrate, total calcium
levels and the T/I Ca2+ ratio were increased in cases of
citrate accumulation. This decreased citrate metabolism
can be caused by a hepatic or multi-organ dysfunction
or both. We found a surprisingly high incidence of an
increased T/I Ca2+ ratio: close to 25%. Meier-Kriesche
and colleagues [13] described an incidence of 12%.
Another retrospective cohort study found, in patients
with hepatic impairment, lower ionized calcium levels
without elevated T/I Ca2+ ratio [9]. Neither study
reported the severity of critical illness.
Monitoring liver enzymes and hepatic protein synth￾esis has only limited diagnostic sensitivity for hepatic
dysfunction [31,32]. The dynamic hepatic clearance test,
the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (ICG￾PDR), is a valuable tool for sensitive and specific assess￾ment of liver function and is shown to correlate with
outcomes in critically ill patients [21-23]. Our data
demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between
hepatic function measured by the ICG-PDR and the T/I
Ca2+ ratio in patients on CRRT-citrate. Although an
increase in the T/I Ca2+ ratio was observed, critical
levels were not achieved. Thus, hepatic impairment does
not represent a contraindication for the use of regional
anticoagulation with citrate. Elevated T/I Ca2+ ratios
were also associated with the severity of critically illness,
as measured by SAPS II. This could be caused by poor
tissue perfusion because citrate metabolism takes place
in tissues rich in mitochondria, such as liver, skeletal
muscles, and kidney. Therefore, a very close monitoring
of calcium homeostasis in patients with hepatic impair￾ment and MODS is strongly recommended to detect
early citrate accumulation.
Conclusions
In patients on CRRT-citrate, T/I Ca2+ ratio is closely
related to the clinical outcome and emerged as an inde￾pendent predictor of 28-day mortality. Larger studies
are required to define the cutoff and predictive value for
the T/I Ca2+ ratio. This ratio is associated with hepatic
or multi-organ dysfunction or both and therefore is an
important therapeutic target.
Key messages
In critically ill patients on CRRT-citrate, an elevated T/I
Ca2+ ratio
• is an independent predictor for 28-day mortality,
• is associated with hepatic or multi-organ dysfunc￾tion or both,
• is an indirect marker of systemic citrate accumula￾tion, and
• signals the necessity to increase citrate clearance.
