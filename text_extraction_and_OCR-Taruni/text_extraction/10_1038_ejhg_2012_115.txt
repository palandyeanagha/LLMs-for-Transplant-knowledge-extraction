PRACTICAL GENETICS In association with
Bardet–Biedl syndrome
Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterised by retinal dystrophy, obesity, post-axial
polydactyly, renal dysfunction, learning difficulties and hypogonadism. Many associated minor features can be helpful in making
a diagnosis and are important in the clinical management of BBS. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and can be
confirmed by sequencing of known disease-causing genes in 80% of patients. BBS genes encode proteins that localise to the
cilia and basal body and are involved in cilia biogenesis and function. Mutations lead to defective cilia accounting in part for
the pleiotropic effects observed in BBS. We provide an overview of BBS including the clinical findings, current understanding
of cilia biology, and a practical approach to diagnosis, genetic counselling and up-to-date management.
INTRODUCTION
In 1866, Laurence and Moon described a family of four siblings with
retinal dystrophy, obesity, spastic paraparesis and cognitive deficit.1
Bardet2 and Biedl3 later reported separately on further similarly
affected individuals who in addition had post-axial polydactyly and
the condition was coined Laurence–Moon–Bardet–Biedl syndrome.
The syndrome is often divided into two entities: Laurence–Moon
syndrome and Bardet–Biedl Syndrome (BBS), but there is consider￾able phenotypic overlap, suggesting that they may be allelic.4 BBS is
now the standard term in common usage.
BBS is a pleiotropic genetic disorder with significant interfamilial
and intrafamilial variation.5,6 Inheritance is traditionally considered
autosomal recessive, although notable exceptions exist, whereby
BBS may be an oligogenic disorder.7 The prevalence of BBS varies
markedly between populations; from 1:160 000 in northern European
populations5 to 1:13 500 and 1:17 5000, respectively, in isolated
communities in Kuwait and Newfoundland, where a higher level of
consanguinity prevails.8,9 Studies on the families in Newfoundland
affected with BBS revealed a minimum of six BBS loci and eight
different BBS mutations and therefore the high prevalence cannot
be attributed to a single founder.10
CLINICAL OVERVIEW
The BBS phenotype evolves slowly throughout the first decade of life,
although there is a considerable variability. As a result, most patients are
diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood. Post-axial polydactyly is
common and may be the only obvious dysmorphic feature at birth. This
may affect all four limbs or only upper or lower limbs and may occur in
conjunction with brachydactyly and/or syndactlyly.
The most common diagnostic handle prompting investigation for
BBS is the development of rod-cone dystrophy. Primary loss of rod
photoreceptors is followed by later demise of cone photoreceptors.11
This presents as an atypical retinitis pigmentosa with early macular
involvement.12 The clinical manifestation is gradual onset of night
blindness, followed by photophobia and loss of central and colour
vision.11 Many variants of the ophthalmological phenotype in BBS
have been described and some patients develop the converse sequence
of pathological events with early loss of cone photoreceptors followed
by rod photoreceptors.4 Electroretinography is the investigation of
choice and may show early changes within the first two years of life,
although significant changes are rarely visible before the age of five.12
Symptoms usually develop in the first decade of life and most patients
are legally blind by the second or third decade,13 although moderate
forms of the disease do exist. Other eye abnormalities such as cataracts
and refractive errors are also prevalent in BBS.
Obesity is another major clinical finding and the incidence is
reported to be 72–86% in the BBS population.4,6,14–17 Birth weight
is usually within the normal range, although there is an evidence
of a skewed distribution towards the upper centiles.18 One-third of
those with a normal birth weight develop obesity by the age of one.18
Although adult obesity tends to be truncal, it appears to be
widespread and diffuse in childhood.
The development of type 2 diabetes is prevalent among patients.
It may be related to the level of obesity and it is often found in
association with other signs of metabolic syndrome.
Hypogonadism may manifest as delayed puberty or hypogenitalism
in males and genital abnormalities in females.4,17,19 This may occur

independently or in conjunction with biochemical hypogonadism.
A wide variety of genital malformations have been observed in
females, contributing to the low rates of fertility in BBS. Males are
almost invariably infertile.
Developmental delay and cognitive deficit are common in BBS.
Delay is often global but may be specific to certain areas of
development.12 In a cohort of 109 patients, cognitive deficit was
reported in 62% and half of these patients attended a special school.4
Children with BBS are often reported to have labile behaviour with
outbursts of frustration.4,17,19 Many prefer to have a fixed routine and
may have elements of obsessive compulsive behaviour and lack of
social dominance.4 Others have a more severe behavioural phenotype
and develop autistic spectrum disorder or psychosis.4
Renal abnormalities can be a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in BBS.20 The renal phenotype is variable but classically
manifests with cystic tubular disease and anatomical malformations.18
Urinary concentration defects are prevalent even in patients with
near-normal renal function and no major cysts.21
Speech deficit has been reported in 60% of patients.22 This mainly
consists of high-pitched nasal speech and children often do not
develop intelligible speech before the age of four. It has been suggested
that substitution of the first consonant of a word may be
characteristic.4 Speech difficulties may be complicated by hearing
loss, which is reported in 17–21% of patients.4,19 Most patients
suffer conductive hearing loss secondary to chronic otitis media.4
Speech delay in children with BBS is generally responsive to speech
therapy.4
Involvement of other organ systems such as the heart and
gastrointestinal system are also observed. The type of cardiac abnor￾malities observed in BBS is highly variable. An echocardiography
study of 22 individuals from three highly consanguineous Bedouin
families revealed a frequency of heart defects of 50%.23 Beales et al4
found a frequency of only 7% in a study based on 109 patients.
Cardiac abnormalities include valvular stenoses, patent ductus
arteriosis and cardiomyopathies.4 Hepatic involvement ranges from
fibrosis to cystic dilatation of the bile duct, intrahepatic and
extrahepatic tracts.12 Hirschsprungs disease has been documented in
BBS but the incidence of this association is unknown.24
Dental crowding and a high-arched palate are common. Other
abnormalities include hypodontia, malocclusion and enamel
hypoplasia.5 Anosmia has been described following observations in
a mouse model. In a study of 19 BBS patients, nine had anosmia/
hyposmia.25
Many affected individuals suffer from a degree of clumsiness and
40% of one cohort describe signs of ataxia and poor coordination.4
Dysdiadochokinesia and past pointing are common (79%) as are
difficulties with tandem walking and the Fogg test.4
There is a significant overlap in clinical features within the
ciliopathy disease spectrum. Although the classical features associated
with BBS are well documented, it has been suggested that the BBS
phenotype may be even more confluent with other ciliopathies
such as Alstro¨m and McKusick–Kauffman syndromes than previously
reported.19 Alstro¨m syndrome is usually differentiated from
BBS by the presence of hearing loss and absence of polydactyly and
learning difficulties. Patients with McKusick–Kauffman syndrome
have a high prevalence of urogenital anomalies but normally lack
the obesity, rod-cone dystrophy, and learning difficulties characteristic
of BBS. Diagnostic difficulties arise as these features are age￾dependent in BBS.26
Carriers of BBS do not appear to be at increased risk of
hypertension or diabetes,4,10 although conflicting evidence exists
regarding the possible increased risk of obesity in carriers.4,10,27,28
An increase in renal cancers and malformations,29 as well as retinal
dysfunction,30 has been reported in obligate carriers.
Of note, mutation analysis in non-BBS lean and obese Caucasian
patients revealed an association between single-nucleotide
polymorphisms in BBS2, BBS4 and BBS6 and common obesity.31
DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
Unless the diagnosis is suspected based on antenatal imaging revealing
polydactyly and structural renal abnormalities, BBS is usually not
diagnosed before the patient starts to develop the visual problems
characteristic of rod-cone dystrophy. Although there are some
distinctive dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, midface
hypoplasia and retrognathia, these are inconsistently present and
can be subtle. Figure 1 demonstrates the variation of facial features
seen in BBS. Modified diagnostic criteria by Beales et al4 suggest that
either four primary features or three primary and two secondary
features are required to make a clinical diagnosis. Table 1 summarises
the major and minor clinical features and their incidence in BBS.
Molecular confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained in nearly
80% via direct sequencing of the BBS genes. Billingsley et al32 have
suggested a practical approach to mutational screening where
sequencing is prioritised in accordance with the frequency
of pathogenic mutations between and within BBS genes in order to
provide an efficient and cost-effective service.
GENETIC BASIS OF THE DISEASE
The last decade has seen a rapid expansion in research into this
syndrome, resulting in the discovery of 16 BBS genes accounting for
approximately 80% of clinically diagnosed BBS (Table 2). The
majority of pathogenic mutations are found in BBS1 and BBS10,
accounting for 23.2% and 20%, respectively,5 although some regional
variation in prevalence exists.15 Some genes appear to have greater
ethnic specific frequency than others, although no mutated genes are
found exclusively in a single ethnic population. In northern European
individuals, BBS1 M390R and BBS10 C91LfsX5 are the most common
alleles, whereas mutations in BBS4, BBS5 and TTC8 are mainly seen
in patients of Middle Eastern and North African descent.32 Although
traditionally considered an autosomal recessive condition, there are
several reported cases of a triallelic mode of inheritance where three
mutations in BBS genes are required before the phenotype becomes
apparent, or alternatively where a third disease locus acts as a disease
modifier.7,33–36
As well as the phenotypic overlaps exhibited between ciliopathies,
there is an emerging evidence suggesting that genes mutated in BBS
and other ciliopathies exhibit some genetic overlap.37 For example,
mutations in BBS2, BBS4 and BBS6 have been identified in
patients with Meckel syndrome.38 Similarly, mutations in MKS1,
which normally lead to Meckel syndrome, may be associated with a
BBS phenotype and mutations in MKS3 have been identified in
patients with BBS and Joubert syndrome.39 It appears that the
ciliopathy phenotype reflects both the specific mutated loci and the
total mutational load.39,40
Genotype–phenotype correlation
Genotype–phenotype correlations are poor, although one study
suggests a milder phenotype associated with the common M390R
mutation found in BBS1.
15 Other studies have suggested that specific
ocular phenotypes41,42 and more severe digital abnormalities42 may be
linked to BBS2, BBS3 and BBS4 mutations. Large-scale studies have
not supported these findings, and predictions about correlation are

further compounded by the significant interfamilial and intrafamilial
phenotypic variability. This supports the hypothesis that the BBS
proteins interact in a common cellular process, thus making the
genotypes clinically indistinguishable.37
Submission of BBS gene variants to a public databases such as
Mutadatabase (www.mutadatabase.org) may aid in further delinea￾tion of the genotype–phenotype correlation.
BIOLOGY OF THE DISEASE
Cilia are highly conserved cellular structures projecting from the
apical surface of most vertebral cells. They fall into two classes: motile
and immotile (primary) cilia.12,14 Motile cilia are organised in a
‘9þ 2’ microtubule configuration in which nine microtubule pairs
surround a central doublet. These cilia generate flow or movement of
fluid. Figure 2 outlines the structure of the motile and immotile
cilium. Defective motile cilia can result in primary ciliary dyskinesias
manifesting with bronchiectasis, infertility and left-right asymmetry.43
Immotile (primary) cilia are thought to function mainly as a sensory
organelle regulating the signal transduction pathways and have a
‘9þ 0’ configuration, similar in structure to the motile cilia but
without the central pair.12,14,44 Defects in immotile cilia are
characterised clinically by retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, situs
inversus, learning difficulties and cystic kidneys, liver and
pancreas.39 BBS is a disease of immotile cilia.
The cilium is anchored in a basal body, a specialised centriole that
acts as a microtubule-organising centre. Ciliogenesis and maintenance
is orchestrated via the basal body acting in concert with the BBSome,
which in turn is modulated by a chaperonin complex and members
of the Rab family of proteins.43 Together these proteins facilitate
intraflagellar transport (IFT). This cellular process of bidirectional
movement of particles facilitates the formation and maintenance
of the cilium (Figure 2).

BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8 and BBS9 form the BBSome
complex45–47 and BBS6, BBS10 and BBS12 form the chaperonin
complex.48 The remaining known disease-causing genes have variable
predicted functions as outlined in Table 2. No phenotypic difference has
been ascertained between patients harbouring disease-causing mutations
in genes associated with the BBSome compared with individuals with
mutations in genes associated with the chaperonin complex.
The molecular pathogenesis of the pleiotropic effects of BBS
has been elucidated only in part. The obesity observed in BBS is
multifactorial in origin. Energy metabolism appears to be similar in
BBS patients and matched obese patients in the general population.49
Mouse models demonstrate an association between BBS deficiency,
increased food intake and decreased physical activity, and there is
evidence of peripheral leptin resistance.50 Leptin is a satiety hormone
that acts by binding to leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. BBS￾mutant mice have increased leptin levels. Co-immunoprecipitation
experiments show that the BBS1 protein interacts directly with leptin
receptors and that the common M390R mutation disrupts this
interaction.51,52
Marion et al53 found that primary cilia are transiently present in
differentiating pre-adipocytes and contain receptors for Wnt
and hedgehog pathways. These highly conserved signalling pathways
are integral to normal development and act as modulators of
adipogenesis. Inhibition of BBS10 and BBS12 induces adipogenesis
and suggested that this is secondary to disruption of Wnt signalling,
which could not be detected after BBS knock down.53
Rod-cone dystrophy is thought to be a consequence of abnormal
trafficking across the defective modified cilia connecting the inner and
outer segments of photoreceptors leading to apoptosis.50,54,55
Receptors for sonic hedgehog signalling are found on cilia in
the developing limb buds.55 IFT proteins are thought to modulate
this pathway39 and dysregulation has been associated with the limb
malformations observed in ciliopathies.56
The mTOR signalling inhibitor rapamycin rescues the renal
cysts found in BBS zebrafish morphants, implicating the signalling
pathways upstream of mTOR in BBS renal pathology.57
Hyposmia/anosmia may be attributed to defective ciliated olfactory
epithelium and subfertility in part to defective cilia in sperm cells/oviducts.
BBS was first linked to ciliary dysfunction following the identifica￾tion of BBS8, which localises to ciliated structures and to basal bodies
and centrosomes in cells.58 Since then several animal models have
confirmed these findings and have furthered current understanding of
the function of BBS proteins. Mouse and zebrafish models have
identified the role of BBS proteins in Wnt and sonic hedgehog
pathways, as well as other signalling pathways.39 BBS proteins have
been demonstrated to regulate IFT and lipid homoeostasis in worms
and modulate intracellular trafficking and centrosomal function in
zebrafish.59 Mouse models share many of the phenotypic features
observed in humans affected with BBS and therefore serve as an
excellent mammalian model of the disease. Simons et al60
demonstrated this with successful gene therapy preventing
photoreceptor death in the BBS4-null murine model. Furthermore,
progress in understanding the biological basis for obesity in mouse
models may lead to targeted drug therapy for the management of
obesity in BBS patients.28,52
MANAGEMENT
A multidisciplinary approach is required to effectively manage this
pleiotropic condition. Although research is in progress, there is still
no targeted treatment for BBS. Complications associated with BBS
should be treated symptomatically as in the general population.

outlines the appropriate assessment pathway of patients with sus￾pected BBS who do not fulfil the modified diagnostic criteria for BBS.
Blood pressure should be measured six monthly or more often if
there is evidence of hypertension. Antihypertensives and lipid-low￾ering medication should be prescribed as appropriate. It is recom￾mended that all the patients have at least one baseline renal
ultrasound to rule out any obvious malformations. Focused ques￾tioning regarding any symptoms of diabetes insipidus is helpful as this
often overlooked entity is frequently seen in patients with BBS.
Patients with renal impairment should be referred to a nephrologist.
A detailed ophthalmological assessment including an electroretino￾gram is required to determine the onset and degree of rod-cone
dystrophy and to screen for other visual defects such as refractive
error, diabetic retinopathy or cataracts. Visual aids and mobility
training can significantly improve the quality of life for those who are
visually impaired.
Effective weight management is imperative to avoid associated
morbidity such as metabolic syndrome to which patients with BBS
may be particularly susceptible. Exercise and dietetics review can assist
in providing a weight-loss strategy.
Regular developmental and educational assessment is required to
ensure that patients gain optimally from their learning environment.
It is noteworthy that although early assessment is helpful in placing a
child in the best educational environment, it is not always indicative
of full adult potential.4 Many patients benefit from a review by a
clinical psychologist to help with anxiety, depression or behavioural
issues, which are more common in BBS.
Endocrinological assessment must include assessment for any signs
and symptoms of diabetes mellitus with subsequent oral glucose
tolerance testing if appropriate. Assessment of thyroid function,
lipid profile and development of secondary sexual characteristics is
important. If appropriate, further pituitary function testing can be
done and hormone replacement therapy instigated.
Depending on individual need, referral to an orthodontist for
assessment of dental crowding/hypodontia or a cardiologist for inves￾tigation of any structural cardiac abnormalities may be appropriate.
Genetic counselling
BBS is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although
there are multiple cases of triallelic inheritance, these cases are difficult
to identify and thought to account for less than 10% of all cases.5 It is
therefore appropriate to counsel patients and families according to the
traditional autosomal recessive recurrence risk. Hence, any sibling of an
affected child has a 25% risk of being affected, 50% risk of being an
asymptomatic carrier and 25% of being unaffected and not a carrier.
In families where the disease-causing mutations are known,
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal testing may be
possible. Alternatively, in at-risk families where the mutation is
unknown, targeted second trimester sonography may be applied for
the visualisation of post-axial polydactyly and renal malformations
indicative of a diagnosis of BBS.61,62
Patients and parents should be advised of the heterogeneous nature of
the condition. The considerable interfamilial and intrafamilial variation
hampers predictions about individual educational attainments, visual
deterioration or other difficulties associated with BBS. Although
infertility is the norm, this cannot be assumed as there are several
reports of both men and women with BBS who have had children.4
CONCLUSION
Since the first gene for BBS was identified over a decade ago, there
have been extensive developments within the field. A total of
16 disease-causing genes have now been discovered and our under￾standing of their functional properties has facilitated an insight into
the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary phenotypes in general
and BBS in particular. In the coming years, it is likely that other
disease-causing genes will be identified and that there will be further
improvement of the clinical diagnostic services allowing for faster
diagnosis and prenatal testing.
The ability to more accurately predict the level of disability an
affected individual is likely to experience may be improved
by furthering our understanding of the molecular processes leading
to phenotypic variation. Understanding the epigenetic factors that
may account for intrafamilial variation and other modifiers of the
condition will be imperative in this process.
Elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of the clinical features of
BBS and research into therapeutics may yield novel treatment options
that target organ-specific aspects of the condition, such as renal cysts
