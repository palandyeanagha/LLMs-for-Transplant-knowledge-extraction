Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that also modulates physi￾ologic cell signaling pathways. MIF is expressed in cardiomyocytes and limits cardiac injury by enhancing
AMPK activity during ischemia. Reperfusion injury is mediated in part by activation of the stress kinase JNK,
but whether MIF modulates JNK in this setting is unknown. We examined the role of MIF in regulating JNK
activation and cardiac injury during experimental ischemia/reperfusion in mouse hearts. Isolated perfused
Mif–/– hearts had greater contractile dysfunction, necrosis, and JNK activation than WT hearts, with increased
upstream MAPK kinase 4 phosphorylation, following ischemia/reperfusion. These effects were reversed if
recombinant MIF was present during reperfusion, indicating that MIF deficiency during reperfusion exacer￾bated injury. Activated JNK acts in a proapoptotic manner by regulating BCL2-associated agonist of cell death
(BAD) phosphorylation, and this effect was accentuated in Mif–/– hearts after ischemia/reperfusion. Similar
detrimental effects of MIF deficiency were observed in vivo following coronary occlusion and reperfusion
in Mif–/– mice. Importantly, excess JNK activation also was observed after hypoxia-reoxygenation in human
fibroblasts homozygous for the MIF allele with the lowest level of promoter activity. These data indicate that
endogenous MIF inhibits JNK pathway activation during reperfusion and protects the heart from injury.
These findings have clinical implications for patients with the low-expression MIF allele.
Introduction
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflam￾matory cytokine that is released from immune cells (1) and
is involved in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis (1), atherosclerosis (2), and sepsis (3). MIF is released
from preformed storage pools and regulates the release of other
inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor–α and
interleukin 6 (4). MIF also counterregulates the antiinflamma￾tory effects of glucocorticoids (5).
MIF concentration is increased in the plasma of patients with
myocardial infarction (6), and ischemia increases MIF expression
in rat hearts (7). Excessive MIF can reduce cardiac contractility
in isolated, perfused rat hearts (8). However, MIF also regulates
metabolism and increases glycolysis and glucose utilization in
skeletal muscle (9). Our recent findings indicate that MIF stimu￾lates heart muscle glucose uptake and thatthe autocrine/paracrine
effects of endogenous cardiac MIF contribute to AMPK activation
and glucose uptake during ischemia (10). AMPK has emerged as a
cardioprotective stress kinase (11), and the action of MIF to modu￾late AMPK might be beneficial during ischemia. These findings
hold clinical interest, because human cells with a low-MIF–expres￾sion allele have impaired activation of AMPK during hypoxia that
is corrected by exogenous MIF (1, 10).
JNK is a MAPK that modulates multiple cellular functions,
including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis(12). JNK is
activated by cell stress, such as heat shock and ultraviolet irradia￾tion (12). JNK is also activated by ischemia/reperfusion but not
during ischemia alone (13). This activation is primarily mediated
by the JNK upstream enzyme, MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) (14). JNK
plays a key role in regulating reperfusion injury, and JNK-knock￾out mouse hearts have significantly less necrosis and apoptosis
induced by ischemia/reperfusion than hearts of control mice (15).
Although the mechanisms responsible for JNK-regulated cell
death have not been fully elucidated, previousstudiesindicate that
activated JNK regulates proapoptotic factors such as Bcl2 family
proteins during ischemia/reperfusion (12, 15).
MIF appearsto regulate JNK activation in isolated cells, variably
inhibiting (16, 17) or activating JNK (18, 19), depending on the
cell type and conditions. These effects of MIF on JNK activation
were paralleled by suppression (16, 17) or stimulation (18, 19) of
apoptosis. How these cellular effects of MIF relate to its action in
intact organs remains uncertain but has relevance to understand￾ing injury during ischemia/reperfusion. We hypothesized that
endogenous cardiac MIF might inhibit JNK activation during
post-ischemia/reperfusion and limit injury. Therefore, we assessed
the effects of genetic MIF deficiency in Mif–/– hearts on JNK path￾way activation during ischemia/reperfusion. We also examined
whether repletion of MIF during reperfusion or inhibition of JNK
activation in Mif–/– hearts would improve recovery of cardiac func￾tion and decrease injury during ischemia/reperfusion.
Results
Endogenous MIF regulates JNK activation through the CD74 receptor dur￾ing ischemia/reperfusion. Isolated, perfused WT and Mif–/– hearts
were subjected to global ischemia for 15 minutes, followed by up
to 30 minutes of reperfusion, in order to determine the role of

endogenous cardiac MIF in modulating JNK activation. In initial
studies, we observed that MIF was released from WT hearts into
the perfusate during reperfusion, reducing heart MIF content
(Figure 1A), as previously described (10). Ischemia/reperfusion
augmented the phosphorylation of JNK and downstream c-Jun in
both WT and Mif–/– hearts, but Mif–/– hearts demonstrated a sub￾stantially greater (2.5-fold greater) JNK activation compared with
WT hearts (Figure 1, A and B).
During post-ischemia/reperfusion, the deleterious effects of JNK
(15) are partially balanced by activation ofthe prosurvival Akt path￾way (20). JNK can also promote Akt activation in isolated cardio￾myocytes during hypoxia-reoxygenation (21). In order to evaluate
whether excessive JNK activation increased Akt activation in Mif–/–
hearts,we assessed Akt phosphorylation afterischemia/reperfusion.
However, we found that Akt phosphorylation at both the Ser473
and Thr308 sites wassimilar in WT and Mif–/– hearts(Figure 1C).
The MIF cell-surface receptor CD74 mediates the effect of MIF
to activate AMPK during hypoxia (10). To define whether CD74
is required for endogenous MIF to restrain JNK activation during
reperfusion, we used hearts from Cd74–/– syngeneic mice (BALB/c
mice) (22). In initial studies, we observed normal baseline LV con￾tractile function and histology in Cd74–/– hearts (Supplemental
Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article;
doi:10.1172/JCI39738DS1). However, during global ischemia/
reperfusion, JNK phosphorylation in Cd74–/– hearts was compa￾rable to that in Mif–/– hearts and wassignificantly higher than that
in WT hearts (Figure 1D).
MIF replacement during reperfusion decreases JNK activation, contrac￾tile dysfunction, and necrosis in Mif–/– hearts. We previously observed
impaired recovery of contractile function during post-ischemia/
reperfusion in Mif–/– hearts (10). This contractile dysfunction was
associated with reduced AMPK activation during ischemia, sug￾gesting that MIF deficiency impairs an adaptive response during
the ischemic period (10). In orderto determine the extent to which
the lack of MIF during reperfusion contributesto excessJNK acti￾vation and greater LV dysfunction, we perfused Mif–/– hearts with
or without the addition of 50 ng/mlrecombinant MIF (rMIF) after
global ischemia. Inclusion of rMIF in the perfusate eliminated the
excessJNK phosphorylation in reperfused Mif–/– hearts(Figure 1E).
In addition, Mif–/– hearts reperfused with rMIF had significantly
better recovery of LV contractile function and attenuated myocar￾dial necrosis compared with those reperfused without rMIF (Fig￾ure 1, F and G). These data indicate that endogenous MIF inhibits
JNK activation during reperfusion and suggest that excess JNK
activation might contribute to the greater injury of Mif–/– hearts
during ischemia/reperfusion.
The effects of MIF on cardiac function are complex, and excessive
MIF has been shown to be cardiodepressant in the heart(23). When
WT hearts were perfused with 50 ng/ml rMIF during reperfusion,
we observed decreased contractile function during reperfusion
after ischemia (Supplemental Figure 2). These findings contrast
with those in the Mif–/– hearts and indicate that while endogenous
MIF has a protective physiologic role, excessive MIF has a detrimen￾tal effect on the recovery of function in the reperfused heart.
MIF regulates MKK4 during post-ischemia/reperfusion. JNK is acti￾vated by phosphorylation of upstream MKKs and MKK kinases
(MKKKs) (12). Both MKK4 and MKK7 phosphorylate JNK (12),
but the exact MKK isoform responsible for JNK activation in the
heart during post-ischemia/reperfusion is not well understood.
We observed increased phosphorylation of MKK4 but not MKK7
in reperfused hearts (Figure 2, A and B), indicating a more impor￾tant role for the MKK4 isoform. In addition, Mif–/– hearts had
greater MKK4 activation compared with WT hearts (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, reperfusion of Mif–/– hearts with 50 ng/ml rMIF fol￾lowing ischemia eliminated their excess MKK4 activation (Figure
2C). Taken together, these results indicate that endogenous MIF
prevents excess MKK4 activation during reperfusion.
Several MKKKs regulate MKK4, including apoptosis signal-reg￾ulating kinase 1 (ASK1), transforming growth factor-β–activating
kinase 1 (TAK1), and mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) (12). In order
to better understand the mechanism responsible for the excess
MKK4 activation in the Mif–/– hearts, we evaluated the activation
of these kinases in Mif–/– and WT hearts. Mif–/– and WT hearts had
similarincreasesin phosphorylation at the major ASK1 inhibitory
site Ser967, suggesting that ASK1 is not responsible for increased
MKK4/JNK activation (Figure 2D). TAK1 Thr184/187 phosphory￾lation did not change with ischemia/reperfusion (data notshown).
MLK3 phosphorylation on its Thr277/Ser281-activating sites
increased to a similar degree in WT and Mif–/– hearts (Figure 2E).
These results suggest that MIF is either affecting other regulatory
sites, or alternatively inhibiting MKK4 phosphorylation or pro￾moting MKK4 dephosphorylation.
ER stress has been reported to increase JNK activation (24),
presumably through upstream kinases such as MKK4. Thus, we
assessed whether ER stress markers were altered in Mif–/– hearts.
However, there were no differences in either the phosphorylation
of protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase (PERK) or the expression
of ER chaperone (Bip) between Mif–/– and WT hearts during isch￾emia/reperfusion (Supplemental Figure 3).
Excess JNK activation in Mif–/– hearts leads to contractile dysfunction and 
altered BCL2-associated agonist of cell death phosphorylation. JNK activa￾tion is known to promote cardiac injury following ischemia/reper￾fusion (15). In order to determine whether there might be a causal
relationship between JNK activation and contractile dysfunction in
Mif–/– hearts following ischemia, we perfused hearts with the JNK
inhibitor, SP600125,which blocked excessive JNKactivation during
reperfusion (Figure 3A). SP600125 significantly improved cardiac
function during post-ischemia/reperfusion in Mif–/– hearts(Figure
3B), indicating that excessive JNK activation in Mif–/– hearts con￾tributes to poor recovery of contractile function after ischemia.
JNK mediates cardiac injury, in part, through the induction
of apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion (15, 25). JNK reduces
BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) phosphorylation at
the Ser112 site that mediates its interaction with antiapoptotic
factors (15). BAD Ser112 phosphorylation decreased in both WT
and Mif–/– hearts following ischemia/reperfusion. However, Mif–/–
hearts demonstrated less phosphorylation compared with WT
hearts, which would represent a proapoptotic effect (Figure 3C).
This effect was reversed by treatment with SP600125 (Figure 3C).
The effects of MIF on JNK phosphorylation in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.
MIF is secreted during ischemia/reperfusion from preformed
pools and exerts autocrine-paracrine effects in the heart (10). To
assess the autocrine role of MIF in JNK activation in an isolated
cell model, we subjected H9C2 cardiomyocytes to hypoxia-reoxy￾genation in the presence of either neutralizing anti-MIF antibody
or nonimmune IgG. After hypoxia-reoxygenation, H9C2 cells had
increased JNK phosphorylation (Figure 4A). Immunoneutraliza￾tion of MIF accentuated JNK activation (Figure 4A), demonstrat￾ing that endogenous, secreted MIF has an autocrine effect to sup￾press JNK activation.

In order to determine whether MIF suppresses JNK activation
through stimuli other than hypoxia, we treated H9C2 cells with
anisomycin, a potent activator of JNK (26). Anisomycin increased
JNK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplemen￾tal Figure 4). However, incubation with rMIF (50 ng/ml) inhibited
anisomycin-stimulated JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Figure 4,
B and C). These resultsindicate that MIF has a short-term effect to
inhibit JNK activation under nonhypoxic conditions.
Endogenous MIF blunts JNK activation and injury following ischemia/
reperfusion in vivo. Patients with myocardial infarction have elevat￾ed plasma MIF concentrations (6). In vivo, the combined effects
of cardiac and noncardiac MIF might impact on the physiologic
response of the heart to ischemia/reperfusion. Thus, to test wheth￾er whole-body MIF deficiency leads to excess heart JNK activation
in vivo, we subjected WT and Mif–/– mice to left coronary artery
occlusion for 20 minutes, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. In
the WT mice, plasma MIF had a 3-fold increase during ischemia/
reperfusion (Figure 5A). The heart MIF content also decreased
by 30%, suggesting that cardiac MIF release contributes to the
increase in plasma MIF observed (Figure 5B).
Similar to our observations in the isolated, perfused heart, coro￾nary artery occlusion and reperfusion increased JNK activation to
a greater extent in Mif–/– than in WT mice in the ischemic region
(Figure 5C). Proapoptotic JNK-mediated BAD dephosphoryla￾tion was also accentuated in Mif–/– mice compared with WT mice
in vivo (Figure 5C). Mif–/– hearts also demonstrated more cleaved
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein on Western blots and
apoptotic cellsthrough TUNEL staining when compared with WT
hearts(Figure 5D). To more directly assessthe role of JNK pathway
activation in mediating injury in the Mif–/– mice,we pretreated mice
with the JNKinhibitor SP600125 or vehicle priorto coronary occlu￾sion, as previously described (27). SP600125 treatment effectively
decreased JNK phosphorylation (Supplemental Figure 5) and cell
apoptosis(Figure 5D), as comparedwith those in the control group.
Mif–/– mice had more necrosis than WT mice, based on analysis of
triphenyl tetrazolium chloride–stained (TTC-stained) LV sections
and higher serum troponin I concentrations after ischemia/reper￾fusion (Figure 5, E and F). However, pretreatment with SP600125
reduced both parameters of necrosisin Mif–/– mice (Figure 5, E and
F). Thus, these results indicate that excess JNK activation contrib￾utes to myocardial injury during ischemia/reperfusion in vivo.
Recentstudies have linked AMPK activation to inhibition of JNK
activation in endothelial cells(28). Since we have previously found
that AMPK activation is blunted in Mif–/– hearts during ischemia
(10), we tested whether impaired AMPK activity leads to increased
JNK activation, using the well-characterized AMPK kinase dead

(KD) mouse model (11). We found that heart JNK phosphory￾lation was greater in AMPK KD mice compared with WT mice
following coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion (Supplemental
Figure 6), suggesting that AMPK plays a role in modulating JNK
activation during reperfusion.
Polymorphisms in the human MIF promoter influence cellular JNK activation.
A functional polymorphism in the human MIF gene promoter
modulates MIF expression. The promoter contains either 5, 6, 7, or
8 CATT tetra-nucleotide repeats at position –794, and the CATT5
allele demonstrates the lowest level of MIF promoter activity when
compared with the others (1, 10). In order to determine whether
this genetic difference influences JNK activation, we studied
human fibroblasts homozygousforthe CATT5 allele (5/5 cell lines)
and others with at least 1 high expression 6- or 7-CATT allele (non￾5/5 cell lines). As anticipated, following hypoxia-reoxygenation, the
MIF concentration in the incubation media increased least in the
5/5 cells (Supplemental Figure 7). Hypoxia-reoxygenation stimu￾lated JNK activation and downstream c-Jun phosphorylation in all
cells; however, the low-MIF–expression 5/5 cells showed the great￾estlevel of JNK pathway activation (Figure 6). These resultssuggest
that the activation of JNK during ischemia/reperfusion might vary
in patients, depending on their MIF genotype.
Discussion
MIF is a proinflammatory cytokine, which plays an important
role in chronic inflammatory diseases (1). However, MIF is also
expressed in several tissues, including the heart, in which it has
a physiologic role during ischemia (29). The current results indi￾cate that endogenous cardiac MIF inhibits activation of the JNK
pathway and limits myocardial reperfusion injury after ischemia.
Specifically, hearts from Mif–/– mice had increased activation of
the MKK4/JNK/c-Jun pathway during reperfusion. Excess activa￾Figure 3

tion of this pathway promoted greater BAD dephosphorylation
and increased both apoptosis and necrosis in Mif–/– hearts. MIF
deficiency during the reperfusion period appeared to have an
important role in the development of injury, since MIF replace￾ment during reperfusion improved recovery of cardiac function
and reduced necrosis. These mechanisms also were operative in
Mif–/– mice during in vivo coronary occlusion and reperfusion.
Finally, we found that human cells with a low-MIF–expression
genotype had accentuated JNK activation after hypoxia-reoxygen￾ation. These latter findings have potential relevance to patients
with the low-MIF–expression genotype who might be more suscep￾tible to ischemic injury.
JNK is activated by varioustypes of cellstress, including oxidative
stress, UV irradiation, heat shock, and ischemia/reperfusion (12).
Our results demonstrate that endogenous cardiac MIF suppresses
the activation of the JNK pathway through the action of its recep￾tor, CD74, during ischemia/reperfusion. Whetherthis observation
reflects autocrine or paracrine effects of MIF, or both, in the heartis

uncertain. However,the former possibility issuggested by ourfind￾ing that MIF has an autocrine action to suppressJNK pathway acti￾vation in heart-derived H9C2 cells during hypoxia-reoxygenation.
Suppression ofthe JNK pathway by MIF is consistentwith previous
observations that MIF inhibits JNK activation in HeLa cells (16)
and reduces apoptosis in noncardiac cells (17). In contrast, MIF
stimulates the JNK pathway in other cells, leading to the expres￾sion of matrix metalloproteinases (18, 30). The duration of MIF
exposure might be important in determining its effect. Prolonged
incubation with MIF appearsto increase JNK phosphorylation and
cell apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes (19). LDL cholesterol
increases MIF expression and JNK activation in human mesangial
cells(31). Thus,the relationship between MIF and the JNK pathway
may depend on the duration of exposure and the cell type.
JNK is activated by 2 upstream kinases, MKK4 and MKK7
(12). Our results and others indicate that MKK4 is the primary
upstream JNK kinase, which is activated during ischemia/reperfu￾sion in the heart (14, 32). MKK7 is activated by ischemia/reperfu￾sion in brain (33), but we did not observe thisin the heart. Howev￾er, the absence of endogenous cardiac MIF during reperfusion led
to increased MKK4 activation, which likely is responsible for the
excess activation ofthe JNK pathway. The MKK4 upstream kinases
(MKKKs) include MLK3 (34, 35), ASK1 (36), and TAK1 (37). Only
MLK3 phosphorylation increased during ischemia/reperfusion in
our experiments; however, it did so to a similar extent in WT and
Mif–/– hearts. Thus, these results suggest that MIF either affects
other MKKKs or MKKK regulatory sites, or potentially modulates
MKK4 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases.
The protective effect of exogenous rMIF during reperfusion in
Mif–/– hearts was likely due to its suppression of excessive JNK
pathway activation. We found that JNK pathway inhibition
improved the postischemic recovery of contractile function in
Mif–/– hearts and reduced myocardial necrosis in Mif–/– mice after
coronary artery ligation-reperfusion. Consistent with our results,
JNK-knockout mice are known to have less myocardial injury fol￾lowing ischemia/reperfusion (15). However, MKK7-overexpress￾ing mice have increased JNK activation but are also less suscep￾tible to ischemic injury (15). This paradoxical finding might be
explained in part by their abnormal baseline phenotype (hyper￾trophy and increased contractility).
Our results also indicate that enhanced JNK activation is respon￾sible for the increased apoptosis in Mif–/– hearts during ischemia/
reperfusion in vivo. These observations are consistent with find￾ings in isolated adult cardiomyocytes, in which activation of JNK
by MKK4 triggers the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (25). JNK
activation also is known to induce apoptosis in other tissues (15,
38). However, the relationship between JNK activation and apopto￾sis varies depending on the celltype and stimulus. Forinstance, neo￾natal cardiomyocytes have reduced apoptosis during hypoxia-reoxy￾genation,when treatedwith JNKinhibitors(21). Nonetheless, in the

intact heart, JNK activation appears to inhibit BAD Ser112 phos￾phorylation (15),which decreasesitsinteraction with antiapoptotic
factors. Previous results have shown that Jnk–/– mice had increased
BAD Ser112 phosphorylation (15), consistentwith ourfinding that
excessive JNK activation was associated with reduced BAD Ser112
phosphorylation in Mif–/– hearts during ischemia/reperfusion.
The current findings complement our recent observation that
MIF deficiency compromises the physiologic response during isch￾emia by blunting heart AMPK activation (10). Taken together, they
indicate that endogenous MIF has dual cardioprotective effects,
amplifying the AMPK response during ischemia and blunting the
JNK response during reperfusion. Interestingly, a recent study in
endothelial cells found that pharmacologic AMPK stimulation
attenuated JNK activation during exposure to hydrogen peroxide
(28).In support of a possible link between AMPKand JNKsignaling
in the heart, we observed greater JNK activation in AMPK-deficient
mouse hearts comparedwith WT mouse heartsfollowing ischemia/
reperfusion. These results raise the possibility that the impaired
AMPK activation, which we previously reported during ischemia
in Mif–/– hearts (10), might either directly or indirectly (through
reduction in ischemic injury) contribute to the excess JNK activa￾tion. However,the finding that MIF replacement during reperfusion
significantly reduced JNK activation in Mif–/– hearts highlights the
important effects of endogenous MIF during reperfusion.
Our findings that MIF modulates JNK activation during isch￾emia/reperfusion may have relevance to human disease. The com￾mon polymorphism in the human MIF gene promoter leads to
variable levels of constitutive and induced MIF expression (1). This
polymorphism has been linked to the clinical manifestations of
inflammatory diseases, including asthma (39), cystic fibrosis (40),
and rheumatoid arthritis (1). We recently showed that the low￾MIF–expression genotype led to reduced AMPK activation during
hypoxia (10). The current findings further demonstrate that the
MIF genotype modulatesthe activation of the JNK pathway. Taken
together, these observations suggest that patients with a low-MIF–
expression genotype may be more susceptible to myocardial injury
during ischemia/reperfusion. They also raise the possibility that
JNK pathway inhibition might be a particularly effective strategy to
prevent injury during acute coronary syndromes in these patients.
Methods
Experimental animals. WT (age, 10–16 weeks; Charles River Laboratories),
Mif–/–, Cd74–/– BALB/c, and AMPK KD C57BL/6 mice (generation N10,
male) (39) were fed and housed according to the guidelinesfrom the Ameri￾can Association for Laboratory Animal Care. All procedures were approved
by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Heart perfusions and global ischemia. Mice were anesthetized with pento￾barbital sodium (60 mg/kg i.p.), and hearts were removed and retrogradely
perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (10). Hearts were stabilized at flow
rate of 4 ml/min for 30 minutes, followed by either continued normal
perfusion (4 ml/min for 45 minutes) or 15 minutes of global ischemia plus
reperfusion (30 minutes), with or without rMIF (50 ng/ml) prepared fol￾lowing the procedure of Bernhagen et al. (41). To test the effects of JNK
pathway inhibition, hearts from WT and Mif–/– mice were initially perfused
for 10 minutes, treated with 10 μmol/l SP600125 for 15 minutes, perfused
without SP600125 for 5 minutes (42), and then subjected to 15 minutes of
no-flow ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion.
Coronary ligation and regional ischemia. WT and Mif–/– mice were anesthe￾tized and ventilated (Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Instruments)
with room airsupplemented with oxygen (10). After left thoracotomy, the
left coronary artery was ligated 2 mm below the left atrial appendage. Fol￾lowing 20 minutes of coronary occlusion, the ligature was released, and
the heart was reperfused for 3 hours. Sham operations were performed by
placement of a suture without ligation. Core temperature was maintained
and the electrocardiogram was monitored to document ST-segment eleva￾tion during coronary occlusion and to detect arrhythmias.
MIF measurements. Heart perfusate and plasma MIF concentrations were
measured by ELISA (10).
Western blotting. Heart homogenate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted (10)with rabbit phospho-JNKantibody from Promega,
and JNK, c-Jun, MKK4, ASK1, BAD, MLK3, phospho–c-Jun (Ser73), MKK4
(Thr261), Akt (Ser473), Akt (Thr308), ASK1 (Ser967), BAD (Ser112), MLK3
(Thr277/Ser281), and cleaved PARP antibodies from Cell Signaling.
TUNEL and TTC staining. Hearts were fixed in 10% formalin and embed￾ded in paraffin for TUNEL staining (Roche). Unfixed hearts were stained
following in vitro and in vivo ischemia/reperfusion to delineate the extent
of myocardial necrosis(10). Viable tissue in the ischemic region wasstained
red by TTC, leaving necrotic tissue white; the in vivo nonischemic region
was stained blue with Evan’s blue dye. Hearts were fixed and sectioned
into 1-mm slices, photographed, and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
Troponin I. Serum troponin I was measured by ELISA (Life Diagnostics).
H9C2 cells. Cardiac H9C2 cells(ATCC) were cultured in DMEM, with 10%
FBS and 1% antibiotic (streptomycin and penicillin). To examine the regula￾tion of JNK activation, the H9C2 cells were incubated with variable concen￾trations of anisomycin (0.001–0.05 μg/ml) for 1 hour. The effects of MIF on
JNK activation were examined by coincubating H9C2 cells with anisomycin
and rMIF (50 ng/ml). To study the effects of MIF during hypoxia and reoxy￾genation, H9C2 cellswere incubatedwith 100 μg/ml of nonimmune IgG or a
neutralizing anti-MIF antibody (10) and thenwere placed in a chamberfilled
with 95% nitrogen/5% CO2 for 1 hour, followed by room air/5% CO2 for
30 minutes. At the end of treatments, cells were lysed and immunoblotted.
Human fibroblasts. Human dermal fibroblasts, obtained from the Yale
Human Cell Resource Center, were used according to the regulations
and with the approval of the Yale Human Investigation Committee.
Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium, including 10% FBS, peni￾cillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C. MIF geno￾type was determined by polymerase chain reaction (10). Early-passage
fibroblasts were then incubated for either 9.5 hours of normoxia (room
air/5% CO2) or 9 hours of hypoxia (95% nitrogen/5% CO2), followed by
30 minutes of reoxygenation.
Statistics. Values are mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey
tests or the unpaired and paired 2-tailed Student’s t test with Bonferroni
correction were used to determine differences between group mean values.
P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
