Abstract
Background: Inhibition of the transporter-mediated hepatobiliary elimination of bile salts is a putative mechanism for liver
toxicity observed with some endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs).
Methods: Sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes were used to study the hepatobiliary distribution and accumulation of
exogenous taurocholate, ERAs and endogenous bile acids. The molecular mechanisms for findings in hepatocytes or clinical
observations were further explored using either vesicular assays (efflux transporters) or transfected cell-lines (uptake
transporters). Inhibition constants (IC50) were measured for the human hepatobiliary transporters bile salt export pump
(BSEP), sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), P-glycoprotein
(Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3.
Results: The ERAs showed dose-dependent reductions in exogenous taurocholate cellular accumulation in human
hepatocytes, with macitentan having the greatest effect. Consistent with their effects on bile acids, the ERAs inhibited bile
transporters. IC50 values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 ranged from 2 mM for macitentan to 47 mM for ambrisentan. Macitentan
and bosentan also inhibited NTCP with IC50 values of 10 and 36 mM, respectively. Similar to previously reported findings
with sitaxsentan, BSEP inhibition was observed for bosentan and macitentan with IC50 values of 42 and 12 mM, respectively.
In contrast, ambrisentan showed little or no inhibition of these transporters. Other transporters tested were weakly inhibited
by the ERAs. Accumulation in hepatocytes was also a factor in the effects on bile transport. Macitentan demonstrated the
greatest accumulation in human hepatocytes (,100x) followed by sitaxsentan (,40x), bosentan (,20x) and ambrisentan
(,2x).
Conclusions: Significant differences in the inhibition of hepatic transporters were observed between the evaluated ERAs
in vitro. Macitentan had the highest level of cellular accumulation and caused the greatest effects on bile acid distribution in
human hepatocytes followed by sitaxsentan and bosentan. Ambrisentan showed a low potential to affect bile acids.

Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and
fatal disease, characterized by increasing pulmonary vascular
resistance leading to right ventricular failure and premature death
[1]. Current treatment for PAH targets one or more of three
central biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the
disease: the prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelin pathways
[1,2]. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide
thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression
of PAH [3–5]. The biological effects of ET-1 are mediated
through the endothelin receptor subtype A (ETA) and endothelin
receptor subtype B (ETB). Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs)
developed to date for the treatment of PAH include ambrisentan,
bosentan, and sitaxsentan. Another ERA, macitentan, has recently
been approved by the FDA. Of these, ambrisentan and sitaxsentan
are ETA-selective ERAs while bosentan and macitentan have
mixed activity against both ETA and ETB receptors. Chemically,
ambrisentan is propanoic acid-based while bosentan, sitaxsentan,
and macitentan are sulfonamide-based.

In PAH clinical trials, the ERA class of therapeutics has been
shown to improve exercise capacity, improve functional capacity,
and delay clinical worsening [6–12]. Despite these clinical benefits,
bosentan and sitaxsentan have been associated with evidence of
liver toxicity as indicated by elevated serum aminotransferase
levels [7,13]. In fact, sitaxsentan was recently withdrawn from the
worldwide market due to hepatotoxicity, with several cases of
idiosyncratic and sometimes fatal liver toxicity [14]. Conversely,
evidence to date suggests that ambrisentan is associated with a low
risk of hepatic injury [11,12]. In the pivotal ARIES studies, none
of the patients randomized to ambrisentan (n = 261) experienced
serum aminotransferase concentrations .3 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN) as compared to several patients receiving placebo
[11]. This pattern continued in the long-term extension study
(ARIES-E), with an incidence of elevated aminotransferase .3
times ULN of 1.8% over a mean follow-up of 1.4 years [12]. While
the biological reasons for these observed differences in incidence of
liver abnormalities between these ERAs are unclear, it is possible
that there is a link between chemical structure (i.e. propanoic acid
vs. sulfonamide), endothelin receptor subtype selectivity and/or
differences in hepatocyte uptake, efflux, and accumulation.
Notably, while ETA is the main receptor subtype in smooth
muscle cells, ETB receptors are the predominate subtype in human
liver cells and ETB blockade has recently been linked to portal
sinusoid constriction, suggesting that ETB antagonism in the liver
may contribute to the hepatotoxicity seen with nonselective ERAs
[15,16].
In the phase 3 SERAPHIN study, PAH patients receiving
macitentan therapy for up to 103.9 weeks had a significantly
reduced risk of morbidity and mortality [17]. In preclinical
compound screening, macitentan was selected for its lipophilic
properties and its low tendency to increase circulating bile salts
when administered intravenously in rats [18]. In early testing in
humans, short-term dosing with macitentan did not appear to
result in any dose-dependent alterations in circulating amino￾transferases [18]. Preliminary data from the SERAPHIN study
indicated that the incidence of serum aminotransferase elevations
.3X ULN was 3.4% to 3.6% for macitentan patients as
compared to 4.5% in placebo patients [17,19]. However,
elevations .8X ULN were ,5-fold greater on macitentan
(2.1%) compared to placebo (0.4%) [19].
Perturbations in hepatobiliary elimination of bile salts has
emerged as a leading hypothesis for the mechanism of liver toxicity
observed with some ERAs [20–26]. Inhibition of hepatic
transporters is the net effect of a complex interplay between
intracellular accumulation, transporter inhibition, metabolism and
clearance. For this study, we used sandwich-cultured human
hepatocytes in order to best recapitulate these processes in vitro.
Hepatocyte uptake of bile acids is mediated primarily by the
basolateral Na+
-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)
transporters with additional support by organic anion-transporting
polypeptides (OATPs) while efflux into the bile canaliculi is
mediated by the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and multidrug
resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) (Figure 1). Alterations in
the activity of these proteins can lead to hepatic bile acid
accumulation and liver injury [20,27,28]. Bosentan has been
shown to inhibit BSEP and MRP2, an effect that has been
suggested to contribute to the hepatotoxicity seen with this ERA
[20,23]. Similarly, sitaxsentan has been shown to inhibit NTCP,
OATP and BSEP [29].
In the last few years, BSEP inhibition has emerged as a probable
mechanism for the development of drug-induced liver injury
[21,22,24–26,30]. In transgenic mice, inactivation of BSEP results
in a mild, persistent hepatic cholestasis which progresses towards
severe cholestasis with high mortality upon cholic acid feeding
[21,22]. In a comprehensive study of more than 200 clinical
compounds by Morgan et al., a strong correlation was observed
between BSEP inhibition and reported evidence of liver toxicity
[26]. In a follow-up study of .600 marketed or withdrawn drugs,
those compounds with an estimated steady-state concentration/
BSEP IC50 ratio $0.1 had an almost 100% correlation with some
evidence of liver injury in humans [30]. Finally, hereditary BSEP
deficiency leads to end-stage liver disease in humans [31–33].
Perhaps the most compelling evidence for a temporal relationship
between BSEP inhibition and cholestatic liver injury comes from
three cases of patients with hereditary BSEP deficiency that were
treated by liver transplantation but re-developed cholestatic
dysfunction post-transplant. In these individuals, recurrence of
disease correlated with the presence of BSEP antibodies that
potently inhibited bile salt transport. Consistent with the causative
role of these antibodies, the cholestatic dysfunction in these
patients was reversed by immunosuppressive therapy [25].
The objective of this study, therefore, was to investigate possible
mechanisms of clinical hepatotoxicity and the relative potential to
cause cholestatic liver injury for the ERAs ambrisentan, bosentan,
sitaxsentan, and macitentan. Hepatocellular accumulation and
efflux of the ERAs were evaluated in sandwich-cultured human
hepatocytes, as were their effects on bile acid transport. The
mechanism for observations in hepatocytes were further studied by
assessing the potential for ERAs to inhibit key hepatic transporters
in vitro using membrane vesicles or transfected cell lines and model
substrates.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Test ERAs (ambrisentan, bosentan, macitentan, and sitaxsen￾tan) were synthesized by Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA) and
stored at 220uC until use. DMSO stock solutions (100 mM) were
prepared the day of the study and aliquotted into small volumes in
glass vials for long-term storage at 220uC.
Human Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture
Sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes were obtained from
Celsis/IVT (Baltimore, MD) or Life Technologies (Durham, NC).
Donors were male (n = 3) and female (n = 1) between the ages of
31 and 62 years old. Hepatic uptake, biliary excretion and in vitro
biliary clearance (Clb) were determined using the B-CLEARH
hepatocyte sandwich culture model as described by Liu et al.,
1999 [34]. In this system, hepatocytes form functional bile
canalicular networks while maintaining the expression and

function of key uptake and efflux transporters. The canalicular
system of bile pockets remains separate from the cellular culture
media due to tight junctions between cells. The integrity of these
tight junctions is maintained in the presence of calcium (Plus (+)
buffer) while in the absence of calcium (Minus (2) buffer), these
tight junctions open and release the contents of the canalicular
network into the media.
ERA Effect on Hepatobiliary Disposition of
d8-Taurocholate
Pre-incubation solutions containing the ERAs (100 mM) or
rifamycin-SV (100 mM, control inhibitor) were prepared in Plus (+)
Buffer and Minus (2) Buffers. A dose solution containing 2.5 mM
d8-taurocholic acid (d8-TCA) was prepared in Plus (+) Buffer. Co￾incubation solutions were prepared by combining d8-TCA dose
solution and ERA or rifamycin-SV. Hepatocytes were washed and
then conditioned for 10 min in warm Plus (+) or Minus (2) buffer
with and without ERA or rifamycin-SV. Pre-incubation solutions
were then removed and replaced with dose or co-incubation
solutions and incubated for 10 min at 37uC. Following this 10
minute incubation, the dose or co-incubation solutions were
removed and the cells were then washed three times with ice-cold
Plus (+) buffer. The plates were then frozen at 280uC until
processed for bioanalysis.
Transporter Inhibition Studies
The cellular assays and experimental conditions for the
transporter inhibition studies are summarized in Table S1.
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from
Professor B. Stieger’s laboratory at University of Zurich, Zurich,
Switzerland. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney strain II (MDCKII)
cells were obtained from Nederlands Kanker Instituut (NKI),
Amsterdam, Netherlands. NTCP-CHO cells, BSEP and MRP2
membrane vesicles were developed and validated at Solvo
Biotechnology, Budaors, Hungary.
CHO cells, either wild type or transfected with the genes
encoding human NTCP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) containing 1,000 mg/L D-glucose, L-glutamine,
25 mM HEPES buffer, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, 1% Penicil￾lin/Streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.05 mg/mL L
proline and 0.5 mg/mL of geneticin G-418. Cells were main￾tained in incubators set at 37uC, 90% humidity and 5% CO2.
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 over-expressing cells were seeded in
BioCoat Poly-D-Lysine coated 96-well black cell culture plates
with clear bottoms at a density of 16105 cells/well. Sodium
butyrate (10 mM) was added to the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3
cells once seeded to increase the protein expression level and the
cells were grown to confluence overnight. The assay buffer
contained 142 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM
MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Glucose and 12.5 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4). After removal of the media and before adding test
compounds, the cells were washed twice with 37uC assay buffer
followed by a 0.5 h pre-incubation with assay buffer. Test
compounds were diluted in assay buffer containing 2 mM Fluo 3
and pre-incubated with cells for 1 h. Following removal of assay
buffer containing Fluo 3 and test compound, cells were washed 3
times with 200 ml of ice cold assay buffer and then lysed at room
temperature for 15 min in a lysis buffer containing 0.05% SDS in
a 1 mM CaCl2 solution. Wells were analyzed for Fluo 3
fluorescence at an excitation of 485 nm and emission of
530 nm. Inhibition of NTCP was studied using similar conditions
to those described for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 except that
inhibition of the uptake 3
H taurocholate into transfected CHO
cells was monitored using radioactive scintillation counting.
MDCKII cells were maintained in DMEM with sodium
pyruvate, Glutmax, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 10% FBS
in an incubator set at 37uC, 90% humidity and 5% CO2.
MDCKII cells were seeded in 96-well black cell culture plates with
clear bottoms at a density of 56104 cells/well for Pgp and 26104
cells/well for BCRP and grown to confluence. For the Pgp assay,
test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO and then added
into in cell culture medium (without FBS) containing 10 mM
Calcein AM and incubated for 1 h. Following the removal of
media containing Calcein AM and test compound, cells were
washed five times with 1 M phosphate buffered saline containing
magnesium and calcium (PBS). Wells were analyzed for Calcein
AM fluorescence at an excitation of 494 nm and an emission of
517 nm. For the BCRP assay, test compounds were serially diluted
DMSO and then spiked in cell culture medium (without FBS)
containing 1 mM pheophorbide a (PhA) and incubated for 18
hours with MDCKII-ABCG2 cells. Following the removal of
media containing PhA and test compound, cells were then washed
five times with PBS. Wells were analyzed for PhA fluorescence at
an excitation of 415 nm and an emission of 675 nm.
BSEP and MRP2 inhibition was studied in membrane vesicles
isolated from sf9 insect cells overexpressing the respective
transporters. Vesicular transport inhibition assays used test
compounds incubated with membrane vesicle preparations (total
protein: 50 mg/well) and probe substrates, taurocholate (2 mM) for
BSEP or Estradiol-17-beta-glucuronide (0.2 mM) for MRP2, in the
absence or presence of ATP. Reaction mixtures were preincubated
for 15 min at 37uC. Reactions were started by the addition of
25 mL of 12 mM MgATP or assay buffer (for background
controls), preincubated separately. Reactions were stopped after
5 min by the addition of 200 mL of ice-cold washing buffer and
immediate filtration via glass fiber filters mounted to a 96-well
plate (filter plate). The filters were washed, dried and the amount
of substrate inside the filtered vesicles determined by liquid
scintillation. Cyclosporin A (20 mM) or benzbromarone (100 mM),
for BSEP or MRP2, respectively, were used as positive control
inhibitors. Control membranes lacking transporter expression
were used as negative control.
All assays were performed in duplicate. IC50 was defined as the
test article concentration needed to inhibit the maximal trans￾porter specific accumulation by 50%. IC50 values were calculated
using non-linear fitting of % inhibition versus concentration to a
sigmoidal curve with a variable Hill Coefficient using GraphPad
Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
Hepatic Disposition of ERAs
Incubation solutions containing ERA (1, 10 and 100 mM) were
prepared in Plus (+) buffer. Cell culture medium was removed
from the wells and the cells were washed twice with Plus (+) or
Minus (2) buffer. The wash solutions were then removed and
replaced with fresh Plus (+) or Minus (2) buffer. The cells were
conditioned for 10 min at 37uC. After the 10 min exposure, the
buffer solutions were removed and replaced with the incubation
solutions and incubated for 10 min at 37uC. Following 10 min
incubation, the incubation solutions were removed and the cells
were then washed three times with ice-cold Plus (+) Buffer. The
plates were frozen at 280uC until processed for bioanalysis.
The cellular uptake of bosentan and macitentan was determined
in fresh human hepatocytes purchased from Celsis/IVT (Balti￾more, MD) or Life Technologies (Foster City, CA). Cells were pre￾incubated in Krebs-Henseleit Buffer containing 5% bovine serum
albumin for 30 min at 37uC prior to assay. Cells were then

co-incubated in the presence and absence of an inhibitor cocktail
containing 40 mM rifampicin and 5 mM of cyclosporin A for
15 min. Test compounds bosentan and macitentan were diluted to
3 fold of final target concentration in the same assay buffer and
equilibrated at 37uC for 30 min. The uptake assay was initiated by
adding 50 mL of test compound solution to the 48-well plate
containing 100 mL cell suspension, mixed and incubated at 37uC
for 30, 60 and 90 sec. Final cell density was 26106 cells/mL with a
final test compound concentration of 300 nM. The reaction
mixture was overlaid onto pre-prepared microcentrifuge tubes
containing 100 mL of 2 N NaOH (bottom layer) and 100 mL of
filtration oil (middle layer; 74.5:25.5 silicon oil:mineral oil mix)
followed by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 30 sec. The samples
were allowed to sit at room temperature for 2 h and then frozen at
280uC. The microcentrifuge tubes were then cut and the bottom
layer containing the cell lysate collected. HCl solution was added
to neutralize the solution. Samples were extracted with organic
solvents for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem
mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).
Effect of ERAs on Endogenous Bile Acids
Incubation solutions containing ERA (1, 10 and 100 mM) were
prepared in cell culture medium. On the sixth day of culturing of
the sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, cell culture medium was
removed from the wells and incubation solutions containing the
test ERAs were added to the cells. The cells were incubated with
ERA solution for 24 h at 37uC. After the exposure, the incubation
solutions were removed and the cells were rinsed with Plus (+) or
Minus (2) buffer. The buffer solutions were then removed and the
cells were incubated with fresh Plus (+) or Minus (2) buffer for
5 min at 37uC. Following this 5 minute incubation, the buffer
solutions were collected and any remaining buffers were removed.
The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold Plus (+)
buffer and the plates were frozen at 280uC until processed for
bioanalysis.
Bioanalysis
Study samples were stored in their original 24-well plates at
280uC until prepared for analysis. A volume of 500 mL of cell lysis
solution (70:30 methanol:water) containing 25 nM internal
standard was added to each well and mixed for 20 min of mixing.
The volume in each well was then transferred to a 96-well filter
plate stacked on a Greiner deep well collection plate. The filter
plate/collection plate was then centrifuged at 2000 rcf for 5 min.
The filtrate was then evaporated to dryness under nitrogen.
Samples were reconstituted in 200 mL of sample diluent (60:40
methanol:10 mM ammonium acetate, native pH), sealed, and
placed on a plate shaker for 15 min. These samples were then
transferred to a Whatman 96-well 0.45 mm PVDF filter plate
stacked on a Costar 3956 plate (HPLC injection plate), centrifuged
at 2000 rcf for 2–3 min, and sealed with a silicon cap mat prior to
LC-MS/MS analysis. d8-TCA standard spiking solutions were
prepared in 50:50 methanol:water. For a given lysate standard or
control, 10 mL was added to each well of a previously frozen
analytical plate. Standards representing 0.5–100 pmoles/well and
QC’s at the LLQ and ULQ were prepared. These lysate standards
and controls were then further processed as described above for
unknown study samples. Prepared samples were filtered and
analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Shimadzu binary HPLC system
(Columbia, MD) and tandem mass spectrometry using Thermo
Electron TSQH Quantum Discovery MAXTM (Waltham, MA)
with an Ion Max ESI source operating in negative ion electrospray
ionization mode. Results for unknowns and QCs were calculated
using a standard curve based on an internal standard processing
method.
Data Analysis
Data calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel, 2010
with all values reported as mean 6 standard deviation (SD).
Statistical comparisons across ERA treatments were performed
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher’s PLSD post hoc
analysis (Statview 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary NC); statistical
significance was considered to be P,0.05. All mass values were
normalized to mg protein by taking the average protein mass in
the taurocholate plate determined using a BCA protein assay
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Cellular accumulation
determined in Minus (2) buffer (Accumulation Minus (2) Buffer)
represents the total mass of analyte inside the hepatocyte at the
end of the incubation time period. Total accumulation determined
in Plus (+) buffer (Accumulation Plus (+) Buffer) represents the total
mass of compound taken up and excreted (Cells + Bile). The
biliary excretion index (BEI) was calculated according to the
following equation:
BEI~
AccumulationPlus(z)Buffer{AccumulationMinus({)Buffer
AccumulationPlus(z)Buffer
|100
The in vitro biliary clearance (Clb) was determined using the
equation:
Clb~ AccumulationPlus(z)Buf fer{AccumulationMinus({)Buffer
AUC(i:e: Time|ConcentrationMedia)
Clb was scaled to body weight using the factor of 2962 mg
protein/kg body mass for sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes
(Qualyst, Technical Application Bulletin, TAB Biol 007).
Results
ERA Effect on Hepatobiliary Disposition of
d8-Taurocholate
In sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, the hepatobiliary disposition
of d8-TCA is dependent on the NTCP and OATP influx
transporters and the BSEP efflux transporter (Figure 1). For the
untreated control samples, the mean total accumulation was
226.0676.0 pmol/mg with a mean cellular accumulation of
58.1622.7 pmol/mg. The BEI and Clb for the untreated controls
were 74.7% and 19.967.8 mL/min/kg, respectively. In the
presence of the control inhibitor rifamycin-SV, BEI and Clb were
reduced to 57.1% and 4.562.1 mL/min/kg, respectively. Dose￾dependent reductions in d8-TCA total accumulation were
observed for bosentan and macitentan, with total accumulation
values (% control) of 68.661.5%, 62.666.6%, and 31.765.9% in
the presence of 11, 33, and 100 mM bosentan, respectively and
total accumulation values of 23.660.5% and 4.860.2% for 33 and
100 mM macitentan, respectively (all P,0.05 compared to control)
(Figure 2A).
Significant reductions compared to control were also observed
in d8-TCA cellular accumulation (% control) in the presence of 11
and 100 mM bosentan (66.565.3% and 44.563.6%, respectively;
P,0.05) and for 33 and 100 mM macitentan (42.164.5% and
6.260.5%, respectively P,0.05) (Figure 2B). While ambrisentan
treatment also reduced d8-TCA cellular accumulation at higher
Hepatic Transporter Inhibition by ERAs

concentrations (71% at 33 mM and 52% at 100 mM), these effects
were not statistically significant. Together, these data suggest that
each of the tested ERAs alter NTCP/OATP-mediated uptake of
d8-TCA into hepatocytes to varying degrees, with macitentan
having the largest effect.
The efflux of d8-TCA mediated by BSEP was largely unaffected
by each of the ERAs, though exposure to 33 mM macitentan and
100 mM bosentan each resulted in slight, but statistically
significant, reductions as compared to control (72.968.0% and
85.2613.9%, respectively) (Figure 3A). Analysis of in vitro biliary
clearance (Clb) indicated dose-dependent reductions in Clb of d8-
TCA in treatments compared to control with bosentan (11 mM,
69.260.1%; 33 mM, 58.7611.4%; 100 mM, 27.069.3% [all
P,0.05]) and macitentan (33 mM, 17.262.3%; 100 mM
4.360.5% [all P,0.05]) (Figure 3B).
Inhibition of Hepatic Transporters
To explore the possible molecular mechanisms for the results
observed in the human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, inhibition
constants (IC50) were measured for BSEP, NTCP, MRP2, Pgp,
BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3; these results are summarized
in Table 1. For each assay, the positive control inhibitors for each
transporter showed .85% inhibition. Ambrisentan weakly inhib￾ited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, with IC50 values of 47.0 and
44.6 mM, respectively. At up to the highest concentration tested
(100 mM), ambrisentan did not inhibit NTCP, BCRP, BSEP or
Pgp (IC50.100 mM). Bosentan and macitentan more potently
inhibited OATP1B1 (5.0 and 2.0 mM, respectively) and
OATP1B3 (5.2 and 2.1 mM, respectively). Bosentan inhibited
NTCP and BSEP with IC50 values of 35.6 and 42.1 mM,
respectively, and showed no inhibition of BCRP or Pgp
(IC50.100 mM). Similarly, sitaxsentan has under similar condi￾tions shown no inhibition of BCRP or Pgp (IC50.100 mM) and
inhibited BSEP with an IC50 of 25 mM [35]. Macitentan inhibited
BSEP, NTCP, BCRP and Pgp with IC50 values of 11.9, 9.8, 75.0,
and 64.0 mM, respectively. The ERAs showed weak or no
inhibition of MRP2, with IC50 values from ,75 to .100 mM.

Hepatobiliary Disposition of ERAs
The intracellular concentration is the primary driving force for
metabolism, induction, efflux transporter based drug-drug inter￾actions and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, we assessed the hepatobil￾iary disposition for the four ERAs in sandwich-cultured hepato￾cytes. In general, ambrisentan, bosentan, sitaxsentan, and
macitentan demonstrated varying degrees of hepatocyte uptake
and accumulation with relatively minimal biliary efflux as
determined by the biliary excretion index (BEI) and Clb (data
not shown). The hepatocyte accumulation for each of the 4 ERAs
was generally dose dependent (Figure 4). When expressed relative
to the extracellular test concentration, the accumulation values
were approximately 2x, 20x, 40x and .100x for ambrisentan,
bosentan, sitaxsentan and macitentan, respectively (Figure 4). For
the ERA concentrations evaluated, both sitaxsentan (100 mM) and
macitentan (1, 10 and 100 mM) demonstrated significantly
(P,0.05) higher intracellular accumulation values than ambrisen￾tan at the same test concentration (Figure 4).
A recent paper reported that macitentan is not a substrate for
OATP transporters and that coadministration with cyclosporin A
only resulted in a relatively modest effect on macitentan plasma
pharmacokinetics in patients (10% increase in exposure and 38%
increase in trough concentration) [36]. To further characterize the
hepatic uptake of macitentan and bosentan, the effect of transport
inhibitors (40 mM rifampicin plus 5 mM cyclosporin A) on the
uptake of these ERAs into fresh primary human hepatocytes was
assessed. In the absence of transport inhibitors, the cellular uptake
of macitentan (31.963.4 pmol/million cells) was significantly
greater than that of bosentan (4.660.7 pmol/million cells;
P,0.05) (Figure 5). In the presence of transport inhibitors, the
cellular uptake of macitentan and bosentan was reduced by 41%
and 46%, respectively (P,0.05) (Figure 5).

Effect of the ERAs on Endogenous Bile Acids
The liver is not only an important site of bile acid recirculation
from portal blood flow into the intestine but also the biosynthesis
of bile acids. The accumulation and efflux of the endogenous
glycocholic acid (GCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid
(GCDCA) were determined after 24 h of exposure to the ERAs.
There were dose-dependent reductions in the total and cellular
accumulation of GCA and GCDCA following ERA treatment,
though the magnitude of the reduction varied depending on the
ERA (Tables S2 and S3). Generally, macitentan, sitaxsentan, and
bosentan demonstrated greater effects on GCA and GCDCA
intracellular accumulation and biliary efflux than did ambrisentan.
For example, GCA levels in the presence of 10 mM ERA were
75%, 84%, 55% and 32% the values measured in their absence for
ambrisentan, sitaxsentan, macitentan and bosentan, respectively
(Table S2). Given the 24 h ERA exposure in this assay, the
possible influence of ERA metabolite formation on the observed
results is unknown.
Discussion
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity involves the complex interaction
of drug metabolic pathways, induction/inhibition of hepatic influx
and efflux transporters, and hepatic accumulation of drug and
drug metabolites. The canalicular transporter BSEP is responsible
for the elimination of monovalent, conjugated bile salts along with
some xenobiotics into the bile canaliculi [37–39]. In the last few
years, BSEP has been identified as a leading mechanistic candidate
in the development of drug-induced hepatic toxicity including
what is often characterized as mixed hepatitis associated with
bosentan, cyclosporin A, rifampicin, troglitazone and glyburide
[20–22,25,26,40–44]. In this study, ambrisentan, bosentan, and

Hepatic Transporter Inhibition by ERAs

macitentan were evaluated for their ability to inhibit key hepatic
influx and efflux transporters. Of these, ambrisentan demonstrated
the least inhibition (IC50) of basolateral expressed OATP1B1
(47.0 mM), OATP1B3 (44.6 mM) and NTCP (.100 mM) while
macitentan demonstrated the greatest inhibition (2.0, 2.1 and
9.8 mM for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and NTCP, respectively).
Similarly, macitentan and bosentan inhibited BSEP with IC50
values of 11.9 and 42.1 mM, respectively, while ambrisentan had
no effect (.100 mM). Overall, ambrisentan, bosentan and
macitentan showed relatively minimal inhibitory effects on BCRP,
MRP2 and Pgp.
Previously, macitentan has been shown to inhibit murine Pgp
(IC50 4.4 mM), canine BCRP (13.2 mM), and human OATP1B1
(4.4 mM) and OATP1B3 (10.0 mM) [45]. Additionally, Bruderer
et al. demonstrated very similar IC50 values for macitentan with
respect to OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (6.3 mM and 11.8 mM,
respectively) [36]. While these prior data are rather comparable
to those observed in the current study with respect to
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, the values reported by Weiss et al.
for Pgp and BCRP are considerably lower than those seen in
the present study (4 mM vs. 64 mM and 13 mM vs. 75 mM, for
Pgp and BCRP, respectively). On the other hand, Kim et al.
reported no inhibition of human Pgp by macitentan at doses up
to 50 mM [46]. While it is difficult to compare across
experimental conditions, it is possible that these apparent
discrepancies may be at least partially linked to interspecies
differences (i.e. human, canine or murine) and/or differences in
cell type and probe substrate used. In the assays reported in this
study, results for known inhibitors done in side-by-side assay
wells were consistent with results in the literature and help to
validate the results obtained in the current study.
Given the increased interest in BSEP inhibition as a driving
mechanism of hepatotoxicity, it is notable that the observed
IC50 values for ambrisentan, bosentan and macitentan were
.100 mM, 42 mM, and 12 mM, respectively. Of note, under the
same assay conditions as used in this study, sitaxsentan was
previously found to inhibit BSEP with an IC50 of 25 mM,
suggesting that macitentan has similar or more potent inhibitory
effects on BSEP than either bosentan or sitaxsentan [35].
Though these inhibitory effects of macitentan on BSEP have
not been previously reported, the BSEP inhibition values
observed in this study for bosentan are comparable to those
previously reported (range: 12–76.8 mM) [20,26,28,30]. The
results presented here are also in agreement with those of
Hartman et al. who demonstrated that bosentan and sitaxsentan
inhibited NTCP while ambrisentan did not at the concentra￾tions tested (2, 20, and 100 mM) [29].
The intracellular concentration is the primary driving force for
processes that occur inside hepatocytes. Tissue distribution and
accumulation is an important factor to take into consideration when
assessing the potential for efflux transporter inhibition. When the
transport potential for the individual ERAs was evaluated, the
intracellular accumulation was the highest for macitentan and the
lowest for ambrisentan. In fact, the ambrisentan intracellular
accumulation was approximately two times the extracellular dose
concentration while that of macitentan was approximately 100
times the extracellular dose concentration. The relative order of
accumulation is in agreement with prior studies not including
macitentan showing that sitaxsentan accumulated to a greater
degree than bosentan or ambrisentan [29].
In human hepatocytes, the cellular uptake of macitentan was
approximately 7 times that of bosentan (31.9 pmol/million cells
vs. 4.6 pmol/million cells), though we cannot rule out the
possibility of some non-specific cellular association with the
more lipophilic macitentan. The addition of the transporter
inhibitors cyclosporin A and rifampicin significantly reduced the
uptake of both macitentan (41% reduction) and bosentan (46%
reduction). These data suggest that macitentan is subject to
transporter-mediated hepatic uptake. Bruderer et al. showed
that over-expressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 in CHO cells had
no effect on macitentan cellular uptake [36]. While the cause of
this apparent discrepancy is unknown, the effects of differences
in model systems (i.e. primary human hepatocyte vs. transfected
cell-line), contribution of hepatic uptake transporters other than
OATPs and assay conditions cannot be excluded. The reduction
in bosentan uptake in the presence of transport inhibitors
observed here is consistent with prior data showing that
bosentan is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and
the data demonstrating that bosentan has clinically relevant
drug-drug interactions with both cyclosporin A and rifampicin
[47–49].
Together, the in vitro data presented here suggest that among
the ERAs, macitentan is a relatively potent inhibitor of BSEP
that readily accumulates in human hepatocytes. However,
macitentan is given at a low dose and has correspondingly
low plasma exposures relative to other ERAs. This may explain
why the reported incidence of serum aminotransferase elevations
.3x ULN with 10 mg macitentan were similar to placebo
(3.4% vs. 4.5% for macitentan and placebo) following exposure
up to 103.9 weeks in the SERAPHIN study [17,19]. The in vitro
findings reported in this paper may, however, explain the
observation of the apparent incidence of aminotransferase
elevations .8x ULN being higher for 10 mg macitentan
(2.1%) than placebo (0.4%) [19]. While the clinical implications
of this difference are unknown, further data may be needed to
accurately assess the long-term risk of drug-induced hepatotox￾icity with macitentan.
Together, the data from this study with those of prior studies
continue to define the hepatic effects of ERA therapy through the
coordinated effects of these compounds on hepatic transport,
accumulation and metabolism. This study provides the first direct
comparison of ambrisentan, bosentan, sitaxsentan and macitentan
with respect to potential mechanisms of clinical hepatoxicity and
drug-drug interactions. The results indicate that these ERAs
exhibit significant differences in their ability to inhibit key hepatic
influx and efflux transporters, with macitentan being the most
potent inhibitor followed by bosentan and sitaxsentan. Significant
differences were also seen for these ERAs with respect to their
cellular accumulation in human hepatocytes and effects on
hepatobiliary disposition of exogenous and endogenous bile acids.
Macitentan had the highest level of accumulation in hepatocytes
and caused the greatest effect on bile acids followed by sitaxsentan
and bosentan. Ambrisentan showed very low accumulation and
potential to affect hepatic transporters. Further investigation is
warranted to continue to define the specific mechanisms by which
ERA therapy for the treatment of PAH can induce hepatic injury
and to identify important biological differences across individual
ERAs with respect to the development of hepatoxicity.
