Abstract
Background Pleural infection is a common complication of pneumonia 
associated with high mortality and poor clinical outcome. Treatment of pleural 
infection relies on the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, since reliable 
pathogen identification occurs infrequently. We performed a feasibility 
interventional clinical study assessing the safety and significance of 
ultrasound (US)-guided pleural biopsy culture to increase microbiological 
yield. In an exploratory investigation, the 16S rRNA technique was applied to 
assess its utility on increasing speed and accuracy versus standard 
microbiological diagnosis.
Methods 20 patients with clinically established pleural infection were 
recruited. Participants underwent a detailed US scan and US-guided pleural 
biopsies before chest drain insertion, alongside standard clinical 
management. Pleural biopsies and routine clinical samples (pleural fluid and 
blood) were submitted for microbiological analysis. 
Results US-guided pleural biopsies were safe with no adverse events. US￾guided pleural biopsies increased microbiological yield by 25% in addition to 
pleural fluid and blood samples. The technique provided a substantially higher 
microbiological yield compared to pleural fluid and blood culture samples 
(45% compared to 20% and 10% respectively). The 16S rRNA technique was 
successfully applied to pleural biopsy samples, demonstrating high sensitivity 
(93%) and specificity (89.5%).
Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the safety of US-guided pleural 
biopsies in patients with pleural infection and a substantial increase in 
microbiological diagnosis, suggesting potential niche of infection in this 

3
disease. qPCR primer assessment of pleural fluid and biopsy appears to have 
excellent sensitivity and specificity.

Introduction
Pleural infection is a common complication of pneumonia with a high 
mortality, affecting 80,000 patients per year in the USA and UK combined,
translating to 220 new cases per day 1
. Epidemiological data from Europe and 
the USA suggest the incidence is increasing year on year and most of all in 
the elderly 2-5
. Mortality of the disease is considerable at approximately 20% 
in the six months following initial presentation 6,7
.
Treatment for pleural infection requires fluid drainage and antibiotic therapy, 
which is initially necessarily broad-spectrum until culture results become 
available 1
. In up to 40% of cases of pleural infection, a microbiological 
diagnosis cannot be made using standard (pleural fluid and blood culture) 
techniques and antibiotic treatment is empirical based on local knowledge and 
clinical judgment 4,5,8
. This lack of a specific microbiological diagnosis leads to 
non-specific and broad antibiotic treatment, potentially risking inaccurate
management and contributing to poor outcomes, including the development of 
resistance and complications of antibiotic therapies (e.g. increasing incidence 
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 9 and Clostridium difficile 10
infections). 
Lack of guidance due to negative blood or pleural fluid microbiology may lead 
to medical treatment failure, which then often means surgical intervention is 
required in those fit enough to undergo such management, with all the 
associated risks inherent to such an approach 1,11
. Methods demonstrated to 
increase the microbiological yield include the use of nucleic acid amplification 
techniques (targeting 16S ribosomal RNA sequence -16S rRNA) which have
been proposed to potentially increase overall microbiology sensitivity 1,11
. 
Important questions regarding the disease microbiology remain unanswered, 
which may in part account for the lack of recent therapeutic advances 12
. 
Although infected pleural fluid is usually sampled in clinical practice, as this is 
available for analysis, there is no direct evidence that microbes infecting the 
pleural preferentially inhabit the fluid. A recent animal study of pleural infection 
identified the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the pleural tissue, 
raising questions as to whether sampling of the pleural tissue may improve 

4
diagnostics 13
. In conditions such as malignant pleural effusion and 
tuberculous pleuritis, it is well recognized that pleural biopsy has a much 
higher yield than that obtained from fluid alone 14
. It is hypothesized that due 
to a rich blood supply in pleural tissue, bacteria may anchor in pleural tissue 
with the minority of organisms existing in pleural fluid, but this theory has not 
been tested. 
We hypothesised that US-guided pleural biopsies would be safe and improve 
microbiological yield in addition to conventional methods in patients 
presenting with pleural infection. We aimed to assess the use of the 16S
rRNA technique in combined pleural fluid and biopsy samples, using 
specifically designed primers for common microbes causing pleural infection.
Methods
Study design
This was a pilot feasibility interventional study performed in two centres in the 
UK.
Subjects enrolled
Study enrolment was offered to all subjects fulfilling the entry criteria at the 
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Oxford, UK) and 
Southmead Hospital (Bristol, UK). Subjects were screened during normal 
clinical practice and enrolled at the point of initial diagnostic pleural aspiration, 
which diagnosed pleural infection. Specific details about inclusion and 
exclusion criteria can be found in the online supplementary material. 
Ultrasound imaging
All patients underwent ultrasound assessment prior to intervention by two 
respiratory physicians of Royal College of Radiology Thoracic Ultrasound 
level I or II competence 15. The size of effusion (small = one rib space, 
moderate = two to three rib spaces, large ≥ four rib spaces), echogenicity and 
average number of septations per image were recorded.
Study intervention
All patients underwent real-time US-guided pleural biopsies performed at the 
same procedure as chest drain insertion, using an 18-gauge Temno cutting 
needle with a throw of 2 cm (Temno BD)
16
. The site of biopsies was 
determined during the US assessment by targeting the rib space with 
evidence of more than 3 cm of pleural fluid and no underlying vessels on 
Doppler investigation. Evidence of pleural thickening was not prerequisite for 
US-guided pleural biopsies. Between six to eight biopsies were performed 
until macroscopically satisfactory material was obtained. US guided pleural 
biopsies were taken only from one site for safety and time reasons, as AUDIO 

5
study participants required urgent chest drain insertion for the infection. No 
other techniques or needles were tested in light of the results of a previous 
study published by our group 16
. The material was sent for microbiological 
examination in bottles with normal saline separately to the pleural fluid and 
blood for microbiological analysis in the local laboratory. 
Alongside with the study interventions all patients had pleural fluid (inoculation 
of fluid in BACTEC bottles and normal microbiology sample containers) and 
blood culture at enrolment as per standard treatment 17
. The same laboratory
on each site tested blood and pleural fluid and biopsies for all patients. Pleural 
fluid and biopsy samples were stored for further investigation in the 
exploratory phase of this study. 
Study outcomes
Primary end-point
The primary outcome was the frequency of positive microbiological results 
using pleural biopsy in addition to conventional microbiological culture and 
gram stain.
Secondary end-point
The secondary outcome was the association of 16S rRNA assessment of 
pleural biopsy tissue.
DNA Extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
DNA from both pleural fluid and biopsy samples was extracted using QIAamp 
UCP Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat No./ID: 50214). For the DNA extraction 
either two mls of pleural fluid or the whole pleural biopsy tissue were used. 
Before DNA extraction pleural fluid samples were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 
15 minutes. DNA quantity and quality was measured by NanoDrop 
2000/2000c. All our samples passed the quantity and quality cut-off, which 
was ten times the minimum amount of DNA per microliter needed for each
reaction. Equal volumes of DNA were used for each qPCR reaction. qPCR 
was performed using either Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix 
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat No 368706) or TaqMan® Fast Advanced 
Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat No 4444963) in a LightCycler® 480 
Instrument II (Roche, Cat No 05015243001). For the Power SYBR® Green 
PCR Master Mix assays, bacterial universal primers were used targeting the 
16S rRNA gene. (Supplementary Table 1) This primer set amplifies a 467 
nucleotide sequence of the gene, incorporating hypervariable regions V3 and 
V4 18. For the pathogen identification qPCR assays, aiming to increase the 
specificity of the technique, we chose the Taqman qPCR method and 
designed primers for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus
methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant 
(MRSA). (Supplementary Table 2) For the detection of anaerobic bacteria a 

6
previously published primer set (Supplementary Table 1) was used which 
amplifies a 1,500 nucleotide sequence of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer
19. Threshold cycle (Ct) values from triplicate qPCR reactions were used for 
the analysis. 
Study databases used for exploratory phase
Samples from the AUDIO study were used to assess the 16S rRNA technique 
in pleural fluid and biopsies. Samples (pleural fluid and biopsies) taken from 
patients without pleural infection stored in the Oxford Radcliffe Pleural 
Biobank were used as negative controls. The development of specific primers 
was based on samples from a previously published study in pleural infection 
(MIST2 database) 5
. 
Statistics
All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 7.0; GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean±sd or median with
interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarise patient characteristics. T-tests were used to examine differences 
between groups with parametric data. Mann–Whitney U-test and Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons were used for nonparametric data. Fisher's exact test 
was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was taken at the 
5% level.
Study approval
Ethical and regulatory approval for the study was obtained before recruitment 
commenced (UK research ethics committee reference 15/SC/0171). Ethics 
approval for sample analysis was obtained before the laboratory 
investigations (Oxford Radcliffe Biobank ethics committee reference 
15/A252). 
Study registration
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02608814.
Results
Patients
A flowchart showing enrolment, intervention and ultrasound findings of 
patients until primary analysis is presented in Figure 1. A total of 25 
participants were screened and 20 were recruited between June 2015 and 
December 2016 (17 patients from Oxford University Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK and 3 patients from Southmead Hospital, 
Bristol, UK). Five patients were not recruited due to no established diagnosis 
of pleural infection or the presence of exclusion criteria. Twenty participants 
underwent imaging with thoracic ultrasound and US-guided pleural biopsies 

7
prior to chest drain insertion. None of the patients had treatment with 
fibrinolytics prior to study enrolment. Baseline demographics are provided in
Table 1. 
Data quality
The primary outcome measure (assessment of microbiological yield) was 
available in all (20/20) participants. There were no losses to follow-up, with 
three-month post-recruitment data available in all participants who were alive.
Primary end-point
The addition of pleural biopsies to routine blood culture and pleural fluid 
significantly increased microbiological yield (Figure 2A). Of the 20 patients 
recruited, all had results from blood and pleural fluid samples either at or prior 
to enrolment during the same treatment period. Blood samples were positive 
in 10% of cases, pleural fluid in 20% and pleural biopsies in 45% (Figure 2). 
Addition of pleural biopsies to routine (blood and pleural fluid) microbiological 
analysis increased the diagnostic yield by 25%. Detailed microbiological 
results are presented in Table 2.
A total of 15/20 (75%) patients were established on antibiotic therapy prior to 
study recruitment. Of these patients, 1/15 (7%) blood cultures, 2/15 (13%)
pleural fluid cultures and 6/15 (40%) pleural biopsy cultures were positive. Our 
results suggest that in patients previously treated with antibiotics culturing of 
pleural biopsies samples is more likely to provide positive results compared to 
current standard practice (pleural fluid and blood samples). 
Pathological investigation of US-guided pleural biopsies identified microbes 
on the pleural surface. An example is shown in Figure 2C with gram-positive
cocci in the acute inflammatory exudate on the pleural surface (Figure 2C). 
Population with positive US guided pleural biopsies
In order to improve patient selection the baseline characteristics of individuals
with positive and negative US-guided pleural biopsy are illustrated in Table 3. 
The data revealed no difference in terms of duration of antibiotics, severity of 
pneumonia with CURB-65 score, CRP, pleural fluid LDH, blood platelets and
white bloods cell count that could improve patients’ selection with a potential 
positive pleural biopsy. 
Procedure side effects and safety data
There were no technical difficulties or adverse events in any patient, 
specifically including bleeding, vasovagal reaction, pain requiring intervention 
or serious adverse events. 
Use of 16S rRNA in pleural fluid and biopsies

8
In the exploratory phase we investigated the utility of molecular biology 
methods on increasing the sensitivity versus conventional procedures in 
AUDIO samples. 16S rRNA amplification in pleural infection positive biopsies 
significantly differed compared to negative samples (p<0.0001), mean positive 
samples 24.8 cycle threshold (Ct), (95% CI: 23.74 to 26.68) and mean 
negative samples 32.1 Ct (95% CI: 30.65 to 31.79) (Figure 3A). Pleural fluid 
DNA method exhibited greater mean qPCR cycle difference (p<0.0001), 
mean positive samples 13.1 Ct, (95% CI 12.4 to 14.9), mean negative 
samples 34.7 Ct (95% CI 33.8 to, 35.7) compared to pleural biopsy DNA 
method (difference of 7.25 cycles) (Figure 3B).
Development of specific primers for pleural infection
Pleural fluid samples were used from a previously published study of pleural 
infection (the MIST-2 study) as a platform to design specific primers for 
microbes to improve diagnostics 5
. All Taqman qPCR reactions for 
Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), exhibited 100% specificity and 100% 
sensitivity (total 42 samples) suggesting that qPCR based pathogen detection 
is feasible in pleural infection (Supplementary Table 3). By using universal 
primers for anaerobes (total 39 samples) we were able to confirm the 
microbiological pleural fluid culture in 5/8 (62%) samples and detected 
positive anaerobes in 13/31 (42%) samples with negative pleural fluid culture 
(Supplementary table 3). 
Taqman qPCR reactions identified two positive samples for Streptococcus 
pneumoniae with negative pleural fluid samples. The two samples with 
positive reactions had positive blood cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae
which confirms our results. No increase in the yield was detected with 
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) in our database.
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that US-guided pleural biopsies are safe and 
significantly improve diagnostic microbiological yield compared to routine 
techniques in patients with pleural infection. Pleural biopsies had the highest 
diagnostic yield of all techniques assessed (45% positivity compared with 
20% for pleural fluid and 10% for blood cultures). Furthermore, addition of 
pleural biopsies to blood and pleural fluid microbiological analysis increased 
the diagnostic yield by 25% and in these cases the pleural biopsy was the 
only microbiologically positive sample obtained. Moreover our results suggest 
that pleural biopsy samples are less likely to be negative due to prior 
antibiotics. The addition of biopsy results directly altered antibiotic treatment in 

9
2/20 (10%). In these two patients, biopsy results demonstrated Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Streptococcus intermedius, which permitted the use of 
focused antibiotic treatment based on sensitivities (altered 
Piperacillin/tazobactam to meropenem and co-amoxiclav to 
Piperacillin/tazobactam respectively). 
Given the safety, relative ease of learning and the increased yield of this 
technique, as well as the fact that it can be performed in the same procedure 
as chest tube insertion under US guidance and using a common local 
anaesthetic tract, we suggest that the technique is safe, meriting further 
evaluation as part of a wider study. It has the potential to become part of the 
standard of care in cases of suspected pleural infection. 
The microbiology results from pleural biopsies potentially further our 
understanding of the pathobiology of this difficult to treat condition. The high 
biopsy yield may suggest that microbes are topographically more likely to be 
located on the parietal pleural surface (perhaps due to blood supply and 
better nutrition) rather than being “planktonic” within the pleural fluid, which is 
known to be acidic, hypoxic and lacking in nutrition. If this theory is correct, it 
may help to explain the results seen with treatments that not only divide 
septations but have effects on biofilms in pleural infection 5
.
The majority of patients (75% of study population) were on antibiotics before 
study recruitment which might affected the percentage of positive pleural fluid 
culture that expected to be approximately 60% based on previous literature.
The fact that high number of patients had positive pleural biopsy culture 
results despite previous antibiotics treatment highlights the limited antibiotics 
penetration and efficacy to the pleural space. Our results suggest that 
negative microbiology in this situation is more likely from pleural fluid and 
blood samples than from biopsy samples Culture of pleural biopsies appears 
more robust in the presence of previous antibiotics and this may again 
suggest features of pathogenesis (such as biofilm formation) in this disease. 
The exploratory section of this study demonstrated the potential utility of the 
16S rRNA technique using pleural biopsies. We have here identified four 
primer sets for this assay with extremely high (93% and 89.5%) specificity and 
sensitivity for the detection of the four most common pathogens in pleural 
infection. Given that a 16S rRNA technique can be completed within a few 
hours of receiving samples, the practical clinical utility of this technique should 
now be explored further. 
Our results indicate that 16S rRNA is more sensitive in pleural fluid compared 
to biopsy; this could be related to contamination of tissue samples during 
processing. The specific primers tested in the AUDIO samples and in samples 

10
from a previous large scale multicentre published study suggests the 
possibility of rapid diagnosis of the underlying cause of common causes of 
pleural infection with excellent results 5
. These four underlying aetiologies 
(Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA and 
Staphylococcus aureus MRSA) can be combined and provide results within 
two hours with excellent specificity and thus potential clinical impact for 
patients. 
There are several limitations to this study. Due to the small sample size it was 
not possible to establish specific primers for microbes which have not been 
previously cultured in our studies. Our results show that 16S rRNA technique 
can be negative on patients with pleural infection and signifies the limitation of 
using the technique on everyday clinical practice. Additionally only two sites 
recruited for the AUDIO study with experienced respiratory physicians and 
radiologist in the technique.
US-guided pleural biopsies are safe in pleural infection and improve 
microbiological yield when combined with blood and pleural fluid samples.
The results of this feasibility study highlight that among currently standard 
practice tests (pleural fluid and blood culture) US-guided pleural biopsies is 
the most probable method to identify the underlying pathogen causing pleural 
infection. qPCR primer assessment of pleural fluid and biopsy appears to 
have excellent sensitivity and specificity. There is now a compelling need for 
large clinical studies using pleural biopsy technique as additional test in 
pleural infection and the exploration of qPCR use to improve diagnosis and 
management.
