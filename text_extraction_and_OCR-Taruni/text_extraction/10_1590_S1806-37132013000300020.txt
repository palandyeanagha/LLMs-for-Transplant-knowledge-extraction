To the Editor:
A 49-year-old woman underwent right lung 
transplantation due to pulmonary emphysema, 
with favorable evolution in the early postoperative 
period. A year later she was readmitted to our 
department with productive cough. During 
that admission, the patient was treated for 
cytomegalovirus pneumonia and received broad￾spectrum antibacterial therapy.
At outpatient follow-up, cavities appeared 
in the native lung, which gradually increased 
in size. Ten months later, she was admitted for 
the resection of a hyperinflated cavity. Chest 
X-rays showed an increase in the cavity in the 
left upper lobe with herniation of the lung and 
compression of the transplanted lung. Chest 
HRCT at various positions showed a round mass 
with soft tissue density within a lung cavity 
that moved when the patient changed position, 
thus strengthening the hypothesis of a fungus 
ball (Figure 1). Bullectomy was performed, 
and the histopathologic examination showed 
fungal colonization by Aspergillus fumigatus
in emphysematous bullae and bronchiectasis. 
She was treated with itraconazole and had a 
satisfactory response.
Lung transplantation has become an acceptable 
treatment option for many end-stage lung diseases 
and could be single or double.(1,2) However, 
Aspergillus sp. infections continue to be an 
important cause of morbidity and mortality in 
these patients. Aspergillus sp. is an ubiquitous 
fungus that can cause clinical entities of varying 
severity, such as asymptomatic colonization, 
aspergilloma, tracheobronchitis, active parenchymal 
disease, and angioinvasive aspergillosis.(1-6)
Airway colonization is a common occurrence 
in such patients because of the exposure of the 
transplanted lung to the environment and impaired 
local host defenses, including mucociliary clearance. 
In addition, colonization of the native lung, which 
commonly occurs in end-stage lung disease, is 
an important source of post-transplantation 
aspergillosis in single lung transplantation 
recipients. Aspergillus sp. colonization has also 
been related to cytomegalovirus infection and 
chronic rejection.(1-4)
Patients who undergo unilateral transplantation 
are often older and have a higher prevalence 
of COPD as an underlying disease, a condition 
that might predispose to airway colonization by 
Aspergillus sp.(1-3)
The most accurate way to perform the diagnosis 
is the demonstration of characteristic, acute 
branching, broad, septate hyphae showing zones 
of growth in biopsy/surgical/autopsy specimens 
and positive cultures for Aspergillus sp.(3,5,6)
Our patient presented with Aspergillus 
fumigatus fungal ball (aspergilloma) in 
emphysematous bullae and bronchiectasis in the 
native lung 26 months after transplantation, with 
a satisfactory response to medical and surgical 
treatment. She also had a history of cytomegalovirus 
infection one year after transplantation as another 
risk factor. The diagnosis was made through 
imaging and evaluation of surgical specimens. 
In fact, aspergilloma affecting the native lung in 
single lung transplantation recipients has been 
reported only rarely in retrospective studies.(3,4)
Aspergilloma is characterized by Aspergillus
sp. infection without tissue invasion. It leads 
to the conglomeration of intertwined fungal 
hyphae mixed with mucus and cellular debris 
within a pre-existing pulmonary cavity, bulla, or 
ectatic bronchus. The most common underlying 
causes are tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Although 
patients might remain asymptomatic, the most 
common clinical manifestation is hemoptysis.(5,6)
Risk factors for a poor prognosis of aspergilloma 
include the severity of the underlying lung disease, 
increase in size or in the number of lesions on

level of immunosuppression, and environmental 
factors for the early diagnosis and prevention 
of further complications, such as angioinvasive 
disease. Treatment should be considered only 
when patients become symptomatic, usually with 
chest X-rays, immunosuppression (including 
transplantation), increasing Aspergillus-specific 
IgG titles, recurrent large volume hemoptysis, 
and sarcoidosis. This highlights the importance 
of radiological findings, cultures, reviews of the

hemoptysis. There is no consensus on the best 
treatment approach; however, surgical resection 
of the cavity and removal of the fungus ball 
are usually indicated in patients with recurrent 
hemoptysis if their pulmonary function is sufficient 
to allow surgery.(4-6)
On CT scans and X-rays, aspergillomas are 
characterized by the presence of a round or oval 
mass with soft tissue density within a lung cavity. 
The mass can be separated from the wall of the 
cavity by an air space of variable size, resulting in 
the “air crescent” sign. The aspergilloma usually 
moves when the patient changes position, as was 
seen in our case. Another finding of aspergillomas 
is the thickening of the cavity wall and adjacent 
pleura, which might be the earliest radiological 
sign.(5,6)
In summary, the susceptibility of the native 
lung to Aspergillus sp. infections might be an 
additional factor to be considered in choosing 
the ideal transplantation procedure. In cases 
of single lung transplantation, radiological and 
clinical attention is especially directed to the 
transplanted organ. However, the native lung, 
structurally damaged, can be a nidus for Aspergillus
sp. and provide a source of infection.
