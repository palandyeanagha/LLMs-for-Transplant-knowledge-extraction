Abstract
Background: Disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification in hemodialysis
(HD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is the main regulator of phosphate metabolism. In this prospective
study, we aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-23 with progression of coronary artery calcification in HD
patients.
Methods: Seventy-four HD patients (36 male/38 female, mean age: 52 ± 14 years) were included. Serum FGF-23 levels
were measured by ELISA. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was measured twice with one year interval. Patients
were grouped as progressive (PG) (36 patients-48%) and non-progressive (NPG).
Results: Age, serum phosphorus, baseline and first year CACS were found to be significantly higher in the PG compared
to NPG group. Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in PG [155 (80–468) vs 147 (82–234), p = 0.04]. Patients were
divided into two groups according to baseline CACS (low group, CACS ≤ 30; high group, CACS > 30). Serum FGF-23
levels were significantly correlated with the progression of CACS (ΔCACS) in the low baseline CACS group (r = 0.51,
p = 0.006), but this association was not found in high baseline CACS group (r = 0.11, p = 0.44). In logistic regression
analysis for predicting the PG patients; serum FGF-23, phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were retained as
significant factors in the model.
Conclusions: Serum FGF-23 was found to be related to progression of CACS independent of serum phosphorus
levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in the progression of vascular calcification especially at the early stages of
calcification process in HD patients.

Background
Vascular calcification is common and contributes to in￾creased cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients [1,2]. Disordered mineral metabolism and dis￾turbances in the regulators of phosphorus homeostasis
such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) may be im￾plicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification
[3,4]. FGF-23 is a novel osteocyte-derived hormone
which has important roles in phosphate and vitamin D
metabolism [5,6]. Studies demonstrated significant
relationships between the serum FGF-23 levels and
atherosclerotic burden [7], endothelial dysfunction and
arterial stiffness [8] in non-uremic population. It has
been reported in cross-sectional clinical studies that in￾creased serum FGF-23 levels were associated with aortic
[4], peripheral vascular [9] and coronary artery [10,11]
calcifications in HD patients. High serum FGF-23 levels
were also found to be independent predictors of mortal￾ity in dialysis patients [12,13]. In this prospective study,
we aimed to investigate the possible effects of serum
FGF-23 on the progression of coronary artery calcifica￾tion in HD patients.
Methods
Seventy-four HD patients (36 male/38 female, mean age:
52 ± 14 years) were enrolled. Mean time on dialysis was
60 ± 4 months. All patients have been receiving dialysis

more than 6 months. Information on age, sex, weight, dur￾ation of HD treatment and the etiology of chronic kidney
disease (CKD) was gathered by review of medical records.
All patients received thrice weekly dialysis for a 4-h
period with a standard bicarbonate-containing dialysate
bath, using biocompatible HD membrane (Polysulphone,
FX-80 series, Fresenius, Germany). Blood flow rates
ranged from 350 to 400 ml/min, while dialysate flow rate
was kept constant at 500 ml/min. Adequacy of dialysis
received was calculated with double pool Kt/V and Kt/
V ≥ 1.4 was considered as target. All patients were on
calcium acetate as phosphate binder treatment as
needed according to KDOQI guidelines. Aluminum hy￾droxide was used as a rescue treatment for short pe￾riods. Active vitamin D treatment was also administered
as calcitriol according to KDOQI guidelines. None of
the patients was used selective vitamin D receptor acti￾vation treatment. One year average use of active vitamin
D and phosphate binder were also calculated. Etiology of
CKD included hypertension in 19 patients, diabetes mel￾litus in 9, chronic pyelonephritis in 6, glomerulonephritis
in 6, others 11 and unknown in 23 patients.
All biochemical blood samples were collected before
the midweek HD session. Laboratory values including
complete blood cell counts and serum levels of urea ni￾trogen, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus,
total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and
intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured.
Serum phosphorus levels were measured every month.
We summed up the monthly serum phosphorus levels
and divided by 12 to get the one-year phosphorus mean.
Intact serum FGF-23 (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan,
China) was determined with enzyme-linked immuno￾sorbent assay (ELISA). Intra-assay and inter-assay coeffi￾cient of variations of FGF-23 ELISA kit were reported to
be <10% and <12% respectively. Sensitivity of the FGF￾23 was 5.7 pg/mL.
Patients with increase of CACS more than 10% and 50
units were classified as progressive (PG) group as we de￾scribed previously [14].
Computed tomography examination
Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was measured
twice with one year interval by computed tomography. A
scan run consisted of acquisition of 40 contiguous trans￾verse two dimensional images of 3-mm-thick sections at
the level above the coronary artery origins to the cardiac
apex. Exposure duration was 0.1 s per tomographic level,
and other parameters were 130 kVp and 630 mA. Images
were acquired with electrocardiogram triggering at 71% of
the R–R interval during diastole and were obtained using
a 26-cm2 field of view and a 512 × 512 reconstruction
matrix. Contrast agents were not used. A calcification was
defined as a minimum of two adjacent pixels (>0.52 mm2
)
with a density over 130 Hounsfield units. The peak inten￾sity (in Hounsfield unit) and area (in square millimeter) of
the individual calcifications were calculated. As described
by Agatston et al. [15], calcium scores were obtained by
multiplying each area of interest by a factor indicating
peak density within the individual area. Image quality and
scoring accuracy was assessed by one radiologist who
carefully made vessel-by-vessel and calcific focus-by￾calcific focus inspections of each image. The radiologist
was blinded to the clinical and laboratory results of the
patients.
We divided the patients into two groups according to
baseline CACS as low (CACS ≤ 30) and high (CACS >30)
baseline CACS groups. We have two reason to use 30 as
the cut-off value. First, since we evaluate the progression
of CACS, to avoid the extreme percent increases among
individuals with little or no baseline calcification, we ex￾cluded subjects with baseline calcification scores below
30 in the relative change analyses. This cut-off level was
also used for this reason in the study by Chertow et al.
investigating the progression of coronary calcification in
HD patients [16,17]. Secondly, CACS of greater than 30
were considered clinically significant because this
threshold defines the acceptable level of reproducibility
in serial CT examinations [18].
Our examinations of the patients conformed to good
medical and laboratory practices and the recommenda￾tions of the Declaration of Helsinki on Biomedical Re￾search Involving Human Subjects. Written informed
consent for participation in the study was obtained from
all the patients. This study has been approved by Ethical
Committee of Istanbul Faculty of Medicine.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, we used the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Between-group comparisons of continuous data for two
groups were performed using the Student t-test or the
Mann–Whitney U-test when appropriate. The X2 test
with Yates correction and Fisher’s exact test were used for
2 × 2 contingency tables for non-numerical data, when
appropriate. Correlations between numerical parame￾ters with non-normal distribution were analyzed with
Spearman’s rho correlation test. To predict the CACS
progression, logistic regression analysis was performed.
Results are expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise
stated. Variables with non-normal distribution were
expressed as median (IQR). All tests of significance were
two sided, and differences were considered statistically sig￾nificant when the p-value was <0.05.
Results
General characteristics and baseline biochemistry were
presented in the Table 1. Comparison of PG and

non-progressive (NPG) groups in terms of baseline la￾boratory results were given in Table 2. Accordingly; age,
serum phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, hemo￾globin, baseline and first year CACS were found to be sig￾nificantly higher in the PG compared to NPG group.
More importantly, serum FGF-23 levels were significantly
higher in PG [155 (80–468) vs 147 (82–234), p = 0.04]
(Figure 1).
Patients were also divided into two groups according
to median serum FGF-23 levels. Comparison of high
and low FGF-23 groups was presented in Table 3. High
FGF-23 group was found to have significantly higher
serum PTH and 1-year average calcitriol dose. However,
serum phosphorus levels were not different between
FGF-23 groups.
Serum FGF-23 levels had tendency to be related to
progression of CACS (r = 0.207, p = 0.07). Patients were
divided into two groups according to baseline CACS as
low (CACS ≤ 30) and high (CACS >30) baseline CACS
groups. Serum FGF-23 levels were similar between low
and high baseline CACS groups [157 (86–351) vs 129
(78–329) pg/mL, p = 0.85]. Progression of CACS (Δ
CACS) in high baseline CACS group was significantly
higher than the low baseline CACS group [68 (0–287) vs
0.45 (0–2.70), p < 0.001]. Confirming this finding, per￾cent of the PG patients was higher in the high baseline
CACS group compared to low baseline CACS group
(30/46 (65%) vs 6/28 patients (21.4%), p <0.001), which
was independent of serum FGF-23 levels. In the low
baseline CACS group, percent of PG patients gradually
increased with increasing serum FGF-23 levels (Figure 2).
Consistent with this finding, serum FGF-23 levels were

phosphorus and FGF-23 levels (r = 0.16, p = 0.16).
In logistic regression analysis for predicting the PG pa￾tients; age, time on dialysis, serum phosphorus, baseline
CACS, and FGF-23 levels were included as independent
variables (−2 Log-likelihood = 68.72, p < 0.001). Serum
FGF-23, phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were
retained as significant factors in the model (Table 4).
Discussion
In the present study, we reported that FGF-23, which is
the major regulator of phosphorus metabolism in health
and disease, was associated with the progression of
CACS in HD patients. This association was especially
true in the patients with low baseline CACS.
Serum FGF-23 increases very early in the course of
CKD, long before the development of hyperphosphate￾mia; thus, a high FGF-23 concentration is the most sen￾sitive and earliest marker of disordered phosphorus
metabolism in CKD [19]. Furthermore, increased serum
FGF-23 is regarded as one of the most important pre￾dictor of mortality in CKD even when serum phosphate
levels are within normal ranges [10]. In the cross￾sectional studies, it was reported that serum FGF-23
levels were associated with high atherosclerotic burden
[7], endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness [8] and vas￾cular calcification [4,9].
The association of serum FGF-23 levels and vascular
calcification is controversial in the literature. Nasrallah
et al. reported that serum FGF-23 was independently
correlated with aortic calcification in non-diabetic dialy￾sis patients [4]. In this study, serum phosphate levels did
not show any correlation with calcification, suggesting
an interaction between aortic calcification index and
FGF-23 that was independent of serum phosphate levels.
Consistent with this report, we also found that the asso￾ciation between serum FGF-23 levels and progression of
CACS was independent of serum phosphorus levels. To
our knowledge, only two cross-sectional studies were
present regarding the possible relationship between
serum FGF-23 and coronary artery calcification. Gutierrez
et al. found significant univariate correlations between

serum FGF-23 levels and CACS however the association
was no longer significant after multivariable adjustment in
CKD patients [10]. In a recent study performed on 16
pediatric HD patients, serum FGF-23 levels were found to
be significantly associated with CACS [11]. In our pro￾spective study, we did not observe any association be￾tween serum FGF-23 levels and baseline or first year
CACS. However, FGF-23 levels were significantly higher
in the PG compared to NPG group. In the very recent
study by Scialla et al. [20], there was no association be￾tween serum FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcifica￾tion in the early stages of CKD patients. However the
patient population of this cross-sectional study composed
of only the patients with mild to moderate CKD. Patients
with early CKD respond to high FGF-23 by increasing
urinary phosphate excretion which results in better con￾trol of serum phosphorus, a well-known factor for devel￾opment of arterial calcification. Additionally, patients with
early CKD have lower FGF-23 as compared to HD pa￾tients. However, our study population composed of
chronic HD patients which was completely different from
that of the mentioned study. More importantly, our study
is a 1-year follow-up study, and we also did not find any
association between FGF-23 and CACS in the baseline
period as in the study by Scialla et al. However, we have
detected a significant association between serum FGF-23
and progression of CACS within 1 year. Importantly, in a
very recent study by Khan et al. [21], relationship between
serum FGF-23 levels and coronary calcification was inves￾tigated in 99 new to HD patients. Authors reported that
serum FGF-23 was not associated with baseline CACS but
serum FGF-23 levels were found to be significantly associ￾ated with CACS progression which were completely paral￾lel to our results.
Recently, it was shown that FGF-23 might have direct
effects on cardiovascular system. Faul et al. showed that
intramyocardial FGF-23 injection resulted in develop￾ment of left ventricular hypertrophy in experimental
models suggesting the direct role of FGF-23 on heart
[22]. This association was also supported by a clinical
study [10]. Serum FGF-23 levels have been also reported
to be related to mortality independent of serum phos￾phorus levels in HD patients [7] which probably repre￾sents the clinical outcome of the direct influences of
FGF-23 on cardiovascular system.
An important finding of our study was the association
of baseline CACS with the progression of CACS.

Independent of serum FGF-23 levels, patients with high
baseline CACS showed significantly more progression of
CACS. The association of serum FGF-23 levels with pro￾gression of CACS was quite prominent in patients with
low baseline CACS group. However this relationship
was not observed in the group with high baseline CACS.
These findings suggested that FGF-23 might have a
major role in the early stages of vascular calcification
process. In the later stages of calcification, progression
of CACS could be a self-accelerating process without re￾quiring the contribution of FGF-23. The influence of
FGF-23 may also be overridden by other uremic compo￾nents of calcification process in patients with higher
baseline CACS.
The role of serum phosphorus in the regulation of
FGF-23 secretion is not clear [23,24]. Consisting with
our data, studies have failed to show any association be￾tween serum phosphate and FGF-23 levels [25,26].
Serum phosphate levels represent only a small part of
total body phosphate, less than 0.1% [27]. It may be hy￾pothesized that osteocytes sense the total body phos￾phate load rather than serum phosphorus levels and
secrete FGF-23 accordingly.
Conclusions
In conclusion, serum FGF-23 levels were found to be re￾lated to progression of CACS independent of serum
phosphorus levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in pro￾gression of vascular calcification especially at the early
stages of calcification process. Association of serum
FGF-23 levels with the progression of CACS may in part
explain the increased mortality rate observed in patients
with high serum FGF-23 levels.
