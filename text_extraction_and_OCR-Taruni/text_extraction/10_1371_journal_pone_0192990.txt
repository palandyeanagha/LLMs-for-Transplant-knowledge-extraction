Abstract
Introduction
Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, frequently accompanies
chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to clarify the prevalence and the risk fac￾tors for sarcopenia among patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease
(NDD-CKD), focusing on the use of drugs.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on a cohort of 260 patients with NDD-CKD in a uni￾versity hospital, recruited between June 2016 and March 2017. We extracted data on
patient gender, age, cause of chronic kidney disease, use of drugs, and comorbidities that
could potentially affect the prevalence of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the
criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Logistic regression analysis was per￾formed to analyze the association of each factor on the prevalence of sarcopenia.
Results
25.0% of our study subjects had sarcopenia. Multivariable analysis revealed that an
increased risk of sarcopenia was significantly associated with age, male gender, body mass
index, diabetes mellitus, and loop diuretic use (odds ratio, 4.59: 95% confidence interval,
1.81–11.61: P-value 0.001).
Conclusions
In our cohort, the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with NDD-CKD was high, and diuret￾ics use, particularly loop diuretic use, was suggested to be a risk factor of sarcopenia.
Although loop diuretics are commonly used in patients with CKD, careful consideration of
the risk of sarcopenia may be necessary.

Introduction
Sarcopenia is defined as the age-related decline of skeletal muscle mass and function [1,2],
leading to frailty, disability, hospitalization, and death [3]. Sarcopenia is a complex phenome￾non with a multifactorial etiology, and the pathophysiological mechanism for its development
remains unclear. The major factors considered to be involved include decreased physical activ￾ity, mitochondrial dysfunction, anorexia, loss of motor neuron end plates, and loss of anabolic
hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor 1, all of which
tend to accompany aging. In addition, other factors including oxidative stress, insulin resis￾tance, and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and
tumor necrosis factor alpha are also presumed to be associated with sarcopenia [2,4]. Recent
studies have reported that sarcopenia is associated with a high risk of multiple adverse out￾comes such as falls [5], metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-alco￾holic fatty liver disease [6–8], cardiovascular events [9,10], and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
[11,12]. Patients with chronic disease are likely to remain on polypharmacy (i.e., multiple drug
use), which has also been reported to be associated with sarcopenia [13].
In CKD, the prevalence of sarcopenia has been reported to be 5.9% to 15.4% in non-dialy￾sis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) (CKD stage3-5) patients [12,14], and
13.7% to 33.7% in hemodialysis patients [15,16]. Multiple metabolic and nutritional abnormal￾ities associated with increased muscle degradation and impaired muscle regeneration result in
skeletal muscle loss in CKD. Several studies have shown that in addition to the general etio￾logic factors of sarcopenia, accumulation of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate, metabolic
acidosis, malnutrition, excess of angiotensin II and myostatin levels, and deficiency of vitamin
D are specifically associated with sarcopenia in patients with CKD [17–19]. It has thus been
suggested that patients with CKD are at risk for developing sarcopenia [3,20].
Factors such as nutritional status, inflammation, depression, and cognitive dysfunction
have been reported to be associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia in CKD [16]. Likewise,
polypharmacy is common among patients with CKD. Patients with CKD are frequently
treated with a multi-drug regimen, usually including antihyperglycemics, antihypertensive
agents, most commonly renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, antihyper￾uricemics, diuretics, statins, and vitamin D analogs, Although polypharmacy is considered to
be a risk factor for sarcopenia, there are only limited data concerning the contribution of these
drugs to the development of sarcopenia in patients with CKD, especially in patients with
NDD-CKD.
In this study, we launched a cohort of patients with NDD-CKD to evaluate the prevalence
of sarcopenia. The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of and associated risk
factors of sarcopenia using the baseline data of a cohort of patients with NDD-CKD, focusing
on the use of drugs accompanying CKD treatment.
Material and methods
Study design and participants
This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a cohort of patients with NDD-CKD who
visited the outpatient clinic at the Department of Nephrology, Tokyo Medical and Dental Uni￾versity Hospital. Subjects were recruited between June 2016 and March 2017. This study was
approved by the ethical committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University and was per￾formed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects
provided written informed consent. Inclusion of subjects in this study was based on the follow￾ing criteria: (1) over 20 years of age; and (2) CKD stages 3 to 5, according to the Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes classification. Patients were excluded if they had (1) malignan￾cies; (2) active infection; (3) received corticosteroid therapy before recruitment; or (4) under￾gone major operations no more than 6 months prior to study enrollment.
Clinical assessments and data collection
At enrollment, subjects’ baseline clinical data, such as age, gender, height, body weight, and
cause of CKD were collected. Information concerning the use of diuretics (aldosterone block￾ers, loop diuretics, and thiazides), DPP-4 inhibitors, RAAS inhibitors, statins, vitamin D ana￾logs, and xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors, was also collected. The presence of hypertension
or DM was confirmed as comorbidity. Hypertension was defined as either having systolic
blood pressure  140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure  90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive
agents. DM was defined as having hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of  6.5% or taking diabetic
medication. Finally, history of cardiovascular diseases (stroke, ischemic heart disease, conges￾tive heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease), history of fractures, and exercise and smok￾ing habits were recorded. An exercise habit was defined as a routine of one of the following
exercise: aerobic exercise, resistance training, or any other sports.
Measurements
Anthropometric measurements [triceps skinfold (TSF) and arm circumference (AC)] were
measured and arm muscle circumference (AMC) was calculated as follows: AMC (cm) = AC
(cm) −3.14 × TSF (cm). TSF was measured using a skinfold caliper and AC using a measuring
tape. In the sitting position, keeping his/her arms straight by the sides of the body, the subject
was measured for TSF and AC of the arm opposite to the dominant arm. Values were recorded
as the average of three trials. Handgrip strength of the both upper limb was measured using a
handheld dynamometer. In the standing position, with the arms straight by the sides, the sub￾ject gripped the instrument as hard as possible. Value (kg) was recorded as the better perfor￾mance of two trials. Whether gait speed was faster than 0.8 m/s was judged by observing the
subject actually walking. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure hemoglobin,
albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cr), cystatin C (cysC), HbA1c, C-reactive protein
(CRP), and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR). estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated using the modified three-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
equation revised by the Japanese Society of Nephrology to adjust for Japanese physical charac￾teristics: Cr-based eGFR (eGFRcr) = 194 × serum Cr−1.094 × age−0.287 (× 0.739, if female),
cysC-based eGFR (eGFRcys) = (104 × cysC−1.019 × 0.996age (× 0.929, if female))—8. Body com￾position was assessed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). We quanti￾fied muscle mass using skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) calculated as follows: SMI = sum of
lean mass for the arms and legs (kg) / height2 (m2
).
Diagnosis of sarcopenia
Sarcopenia was diagnosed by the criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS)
to assess the presence of both low muscle function (low muscle strength or low physical perfor￾mance) and low muscle mass. Patients meeting the following criteria were diagnosed with sar￾copenia: (1) aged 65 years and older; (2) having low handgrip strength (<26 kg in males and
<18 kg in females) and/or low usual gait speed (<0.8 m/s); and (3) having low SMI (<7.0 kg/
m2 in males and <5.4 kg/m2 in females) [20].

Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics are shown as mean ± standard deviation and median with interquartile
range for continuous variables; categorical variables are presented as numbers and percent￾ages. Comparisons between the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia group were performed
using Student’s unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney’s U test for continuous variables and chi￾squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, as appropriate. Variables signifi￾cantly different at P-values <0.10 between the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia group were
assessed as potential confounders. To identify independent risk factors of sarcopenia, logistic
regression analysis was performed. First, associations between sarcopenia and potential con￾founders were analyzed using univariate analysis. Then, variables associated with sarcopenia at
P-values <0.10 in the univariate analysis were included as independent variables in multivari￾able analysis, and the following five statistical models were used: model adjusted for age, gen￾der, body mass index (BMI), and eGFRcr (model 1); model adjusted for all variables in model
1 plus any type of diuretic use (model 2a) or loop diuretic use (model 2b); and model adjusted
for all variables in model 2a or 2b plus DM (model 3a or 3b). Due to its skewed distribution,
CRP was transformed to the natural logarithm of the actual data before the logistic regression
analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24 for Windows (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Overall, 366 patients participated in this study. After enrollment, patients who were less than
65 years of age or lacked the measurements of handgrip strength and gait speed were excluded.
Finally, 260 subjects were included in the analysis.
Baseline characteristics and relationship between sarcopenia and various
factors
Clinical characteristics of the subjects are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common ori￾gins of CKD were benign nephrosclerosis (48.8%), chronic glomerulonephritis (19.6%), and
diabetic nephropathy (13.1%). Almost half of the subjects had benign nephrosclerosis. The
proportion of subjects who met the sarcopenia criteria of low handgrip strength and/or slow
gait speed was 35.8%, and that of low SMI was 57.3%. When both criteria were used, 25.0% of
the subjects were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Median age was higher in the sarcopenia group.
The proportion of males was higher in subjects without sarcopenia (“non-sarcopenia group”),
but this difference was not statistically significant. Mean eGFRcr was lower in those with sarco￾penia (“sarcopenia group”). The overall proportions of subjects in each CKD stage are shown
in Fig 1. Almost 50% of subjects suffered from advanced CKD stages (stages 4, 5). Although
the proportion of subjects with advanced CKD stages seemed to be higher in the sarcopenia
group than in the non-sarcopenia group, no statistically significant difference was observed.
Median CRP level was higher in the sarcopenia group. The proportion of subjects with an
exercise habit was lower in the sarcopenia group, whereas no significant difference between
the two groups was observed for smoking habits. Concerning comorbidities and past history,
only the prevalence of DM was significantly different between the two groups, with a higher
prevalence in the sarcopenia group. The proportion of subjects using any class of diuretic was
higher in the sarcopenia group, and, further, when evaluated by CKD stages, it was higher in
advanced CKD stages (stage 4, 5) (Fig 2). When different classes of diuretic were analyzed, the
proportion of subjects treated with loop diuretics was higher in the sarcopenia group (Fig 3).
In addition, the proportion of subjects treated with XO inhibitors was significantly higher in

the sarcopenia group, while no significant difference was observed in DPP-4 inhibitors, statins,
or vitamin D analogs use. The proportion of subjects treated with RAAS inhibitors was mar￾ginally higher in the non-sarcopenia group (P-value 0.072). Mean BMI and AMC were lower
in the sarcopenia group. In univariate logistic regression analysis using potential confounders,

the following factors were significantly associated with the odds of having sarcopenia: age,
BMI, eGFRcr, DM, overall diuretic use, loop diuretic use, XO inhibitor use, UPCR  0.5 g/
gCr, hemoglobin, log CRP, and exercise habit (Table 3).
Risk factors independently associated with sarcopenia
The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis evaluating risk factors for sarcopenia are
shown in Tables 4 and 5. Older age, male gender, and lower BMI were associated with higher

; 4: eGFRcr 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m2
; 5: eGFRcr <15 ml/min/1.73 m2
). The difference in proportions of subjects in each CKD stage was
examined using chi-squared test (the non-sarcopenia group vs. the sarcopenia group). Although the proportion of subjects with advanced CKD stages
seemed to be higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group, no statistically significant difference was observed (P-value 0.078).

prevalence of sarcopenia in all models. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of eGFRcr value for sar￾copenia was statistically significant in model 1 but was non-significant in models 2a, 2b, 3a,
and 3b. DM remained significantly associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia after adjustment
for covariates. Similarly, both overall diuretic use and loop diuretic use remained associated
with a higher prevalence of sarcopenia after adjustment for covariates (models 1, 2a, 2b, 3a,
and 3b). Moreover, the aORs of loop diuretic use were higher than those of overall diuretic

any class of diuretic in each CKD stage were examined using chi-squared test (non-diuretic use vs. diuretic use) followed by a post hoc Bonferroni’s
correction for comparisons between CKD stages. The proportions of subjects using any class of diuretic were higher in advanced CKD stages (stage 4,
5) (P-value <0.05).

use. When CKD stage was selected as a covariate instead of eGFRcr, the results did not change
(Tables 6 and 7, models 4, 5a, 5b, and 6b). Even when log CRP was added to covariates in mod￾els 1–3b to evaluate the contribution of inflammation, the same results were obtained. Log
CRP was positively associated with the prevalence of sarcopenia (S1 and S2 Tables, models 7,
8a, 9a, 8b, and 9b). When eGFRcys was substituted for eGFRcr for adjustment, the aORs of
both overall diuretic use and loop diuretic use remained statistically significant and the aORs
of loop diuretic use were also higher than those of overall diuretic use (S3 and S4 Tables,

examined using chi-squared test. The proportion of subjects treated with any class of diuretic was higher in the sarcopenia group (P-value 0.001). When
different classes of diuretic were analyzed, the proportion of subjects treated with loop diuretics was higher in the sarcopenia group (P-value <0.001).

models 10, 11a, 12a, 11b, and 12b). XO inhibitor use was marginally associated with higher
prevalence of sarcopenia when adjusted for age, gender, BMI, eGFRcr, overall diuretic use,
and DM (S5 Table, model 15, P-value 0.042). On the other hand, the aORs of RAAS inhibitor
use were not statistically significant (S6 Table, models 16, 17, and 18).
Discussion
In the present cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of and associated risk fac￾tors for sarcopenia in patients with NDD-CKD, especially focusing on the relationship
between sarcopenia and drugs frequently administered to patients with CKD. We found that
approximately one-quarter of this cohort of patients with NDD-CKD met the definitions of

Loop diuretics and sarcopenia in patients with CKD

sarcopenia based on the criteria of AWGS, which consist of low handgrip strength, slow gait
speed, and low SMI. In multivariable logistic regression model, age, gender, BMI, eGFR, DM,
CRP, and overall diuretic use (particularly loop diuretic use) were significantly associated with
sarcopenia. XO inhibitor use was marginally associated with sarcopenia.
The prevalence of sarcopenia in our study was 25.0%. To our knowledge, only two other
published studies have investigated sarcopenia in a cohort of patients with NDD-CKD (CKD
stages 3–5) using skeletal muscle mass for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Pereira et al. diagnosed
sarcopenia with both skeletal muscle mass measured using a bioimpedance analyzer and hand￾grip strength, and reported its prevalence to be 5.9% [12]. Moon et al. diagnosed sarcopenia
only with skeletal muscle mass measured using DEXA, and reported its prevalence to be 15.4%
[14]. The latter study might have over-diagnosed sarcopenia because handgrip strength was
not included in the diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, the prevalence of sarcopenia in the two

studies were lower than that of our study. The fact that our study subjects tended to be older
than those of the aforementioned studies likely accounts for this discrepancy. Median age was
76 (interquartile range, 69–80) years in our study, compared to approximately 60 years in the
other studies [12,14].
In our study, risk factors significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia in
patients with CKD were DM, diuretic (particularly loop diuretic) use, and XO inhibitor use.
The association between DM and sarcopenia remained significant after adjustment for covari￾ates including either overall diuretic use or loop diuretic use. It is well known that DM is a risk
factor for sarcopenia [6,21] and our results are consistent with those of previous results.
Concerning the relationship between the drugs commonly used in patients with CKD, our
study demonstrated that both overall diuretic use and loop diuretic use were associated with
higher risk of sarcopenia even after adjustment for potential confounders. The association of
the loop diuretic use was stronger. Mandai et al. have reported that loop diuretics suppressed
skeletal muscle differentiation by blocking Na+
-K+
-2Cl￾cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), which was
highly expressed in skeletal muscle by using murine skeletal muscle cells in vitro and in vivo.
Thus, NKCC1 was presumed to play an essential role in myogenesis [22], and it is possible that
use of loop diuretics in patients with CKD may elevate the risk of sarcopenia. To date, our
study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate the effect of loop diuretics on risk of devel￾oping sarcopenia in a population-based sample.
Regarding XO inhibitors, several previous studies have shown that XO is involved in the
loss of muscle mass through oxidative stress, and XO inhibitor use prevents muscle atrophy in
rats [23,24]. It has also been also reported that XO inhibitor use improved muscle function in
a retrospective cohort of older rehabilitation patients [25]. In our study XO inhibitor use was
rather associated with a rather higher risk of sarcopenia with marginal significance, However,
this was only demonstrated in a model adjusted for covariates including DM (S5 Table, model
15) and the magnitude of association was quite small. Obviously, further studies are required
to assess the relationship between XO inhibitor use and sarcopenia in CKD.
Previous studies have demonstrated that use of RAAS inhibitors was associated with a
lower risk of sarcopenia [26,27]. In our study, use of RAAS inhibitors showed marginal

significance for a decreased risk of sarcopenia in univariate logistic regression analysis
(Table 3). However, this association was not apparent after adjustment for confounders (S6
Table, models 16, 17, and 18).
We also sought to identify associations of use of DPP-4 inhibitors, statins, or vitamin D
analogs with sarcopenia. DPP-4 inhibitors have shown beneficial effects on skeletal muscle
[28]; on the other hand, statins have been suggested to have muscular toxicity and induce mus￾cle weakness [29,30]. Supplementation with vitamin D analogs has been suggested to have a
positive effect on skeletal muscle dysfunction in populations with CKD; however, those studies
describing efficacy of vitamin D analogs had small sample sizes [31–33]. In our study, no sig￾nificant difference was observed in the proportions of subjects treated with any of these three
agents between the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia group (Table 1). The relatively low
sample size of this study may have affected the results of statistical analysis. Further studies are
needed to establish the relationship of specific drug use and sarcopenia in CKD patients.
We also observed that in multivariate analysis, the association between renal function and
sarcopenia dissipated after adjustment for either overall diuretic use or loop diuretic use
(Tables 4–6). This reflects the effects of both overall diuretic use and loop diuretic use on renal
function as confounders, since many of our subjects tended to have advanced renal dysfunc￾tion and needed to be treated with some class of diuretic for volume control as shown in Fig 2.
The possible association between renal function and sarcopenia is controversial; several studies
have reported that decreased renal function was a risk factor for sarcopenia [14,34–36],
whereas others did not find such an association, coinciding with the findings of our study
[9,37]. We assume that one of the reasons for this discrepancy is due to the difference in the
proportion of patients with advanced renal dysfunction among the studies.
In Tables 1–7, we evaluated renal function using eGFRcr. Since serum Cr levels may be
affected by muscle mass [38], we considered the possibility that renal function may have been
overestimated in the sarcopenia group. Recently, cysC has become more prevalent as a bio￾marker of renal function because compared to Cr, its concentration is less strongly influenced
by muscle mass [39]. Therefore, we analyzed the data with eGFRcys as well. Results confirmed
that after adjustment for potential confounders, eGFRcys was not associated with sarcopenia,
whereas loop diuretic use was strongly associated with sarcopenia (S3 and S4 Tables). Never￾theless, we deemed eGFRcys to be inadequate to correctly evaluate renal function in our sam￾ple. This judgment was made because it is known that unlike serum Cr, serum cysC does not
increase in association with a reduction of GFR in patients with advanced CKD [40], whereas
in our study almost half of subjects belonged to CKD stages 4 and 5. Although there are diffi￾culties in the accurate evaluation of renal function of patients with CKD with sarcopenia, the
main results of our study were consistent regardless of which parameter, eGFRcr or eGFRcys,
was used for evaluation of renal function.
Our study had several limitations. First, because of the cross-sectional nature of the study,
we could not reveal causal relationships between sarcopenia and diuretic use. We also could
not consider effects of the duration of diuretic use on the risk of sarcopenia. Further prospec￾tive studies will be necessary to elucidate these points. Second, the current study was con￾ducted in a university hospital in Tokyo, and results should not be generalized to subjects of
other races or nationalities. Third, the levels of inflammatory cytokines other than CRP were
not measured in this study; thus, we could not thoroughly evaluate the association between
inflammation status and sarcopenia. Finally, we had no information on the fluid volume sta￾tus, and cardiac function of subjects. We, therefore, could not exclude the possibility that
hypervolemic status or reduced cardiac function, which commonly accompany diuretic use,
may have partly contributed to our results.

In conclusion, loop diuretic use was associated with increased risk of sarcopenia in patients
with NDD-CKD, whereas DPP-4 inhibitor, RAAS inhibitor, statin, and vitamin D analog use
was not. The relationship between sarcopenia and XO inhibitor use was controversial and fur￾ther prospective studies are necessary to clarify this. Moreover, eGFRcr was not associated
with risk of sarcopenia after adjustment for potential confounders, including loop diuretic
use, and the same results were obtained when eGFRcys or CKD stage was used instead of
eGFRcr as a parameter of renal function. Our data showed that DM was also associated with
sarcopenia, similar to previous reports [6,21]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show
the risks of sarcopenia associated with use of loop diuretics in a cohort of patients with
NDD-CKD. Since loop diuretics are commonly used in patients with advanced CKD for the
treatment of volume overload, careful consideration of the risk of sarcopenia may be necessary
in such patients.
