Abstract. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been demon￾strated to have immunoinhibitory activity. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the role of HSCs in the development 
of immunotolerance following liver transplantation. A rat liver 
transplantation tolerance model [donor Lewis into recipient 
Dark Agouti (DA)] and rejection (donor DA into recipient 
Lewis) was established. On the 7th day following transplan￾tation, the HSCs and T cells were isolated from the rats of 
either the tolerance or rejection group and cultured together. 
The apoptosis rate of the T cells was determined 24 h later 
by flow cytometry following staining with anti‑CD3 mAb 
and Annexin V‑FITC/PI. Additionally, the FasL expression of 
HSCs was determined by flow cytometry following staining 
with anti‑FasL mAb. The protein levels of IL‑2, TNF‑α, TGF‑β
and IL‑10 in the supernatant collected from mixed lymphocyte 
reaction cultures of HSCs and T cells for 5 days were measured 
using ELISA assays. HSCs isolated from the tolerance group 
had a higher T‑cell apoptosis induction activity compared 
with those of the rejection group. The activity of the HSCs 
was partially reversed by FasL blocking mAb. Accordingly, 
the FasL expression level of HSCs in the tolerance group was 
revealed to be higher than that of the rejection group. Moreover, 
HSCs stimulated IL‑10 and TGF‑β production in the tolerance 
group. This study suggests that HSCs are involved in liver 
transplantation immune tolerance via the induction of T‑cell 
apoptosis partially mediated by the Fas/FasL pathway and the 
activation of Th2/Th3‑like cell cytokine production.
Introduction 
Although organ transplantation has been successful for 
decades, graft rejection and immunosuppression (IS)‑derived 
chronic toxicity remain as key problems which need to be 
overcome. However, in comparison with the majority of 
transplant recipients who have extreme difficulty achieving 
an IS‑free state following transplantation, a significantly 
higher proportion of liver transplant recipients achieve clinical 
operational tolerance (1). Moreover, liver allografts are able to 
protect co‑transplanted organs from rejection (2‑4), suggesting 
that the liver, unlike other solid organs such as the kidney or 
heart, is an immunoprivileged organ. Notably, although liver 
allografts are the most spontaneously accepted transplanta￾tions in a number of species, hepatocyte allografts alone are 
acutely rejected (5,6), suggesting that liver non‑parenchymal 
cells (NPCs), including resident dendritic cells (DCs), liver 
sinusoid endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and 
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), are considerably involved in liver 
immunotolerance. Previous studies have indicated that NPCs 
mediate immunosuppresion via a variety of mechanisms, 
including the secretion of anti‑inflammatory cytokines and 
the induction of T‑cell apoptosis (7), However, the underlying 
mechanism is not yet completely understood. 
HSCs (vitamin A‑storing cells, lipocytes, interstitial 
cells, fat‑storing cells and Ito cells), exist in the space 
between the hepatocytes and LSECs of the hepatic lobule 
and are well known for their functions of regulating retinoid 
homeostasis and participating in the pathogenesis of liver 
fibrogenesis. In addition, HSCs have been demonstrated to be 
antigen‑presenting cells (APCs) and tolerogenic (8). Activated 
HSCs express negative co‑stimulator B7‑H1 which inhibits 
T‑cell responses via the mediation of T‑cell apoptosis (9). 
Previous studies have revealed that co‑transplanted HSCs 
protect islet allografts from rejection and attenuate the 
severity of graft‑versus‑host disease (10,11), suggesting that 
the HSCs have immunosuppressive properties. The present 
study revealed that HSCs are involved in liver transplant 
immunotolerance via T‑cell apoptosis partly mediated by 
the Fas/FasL pathway and the regulation of TGF‑β and IL‑10 
production.

Materials and methods
Animals. Male Dark Agouti (DA) and Lewis rats, aged 
between 10 and 12 weeks and weighing 220-250 g (Vital River 
Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) 
were maintained in a pathogen‑free animal facility. The rats 
were allowed free access to tap water and food. The animal 
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
Committee.
Orthotopic liver transplantation. Previous studies have shown 
that liver grafts are spontaneously accepted in Lewis to DA 
transplantations, while DA to Lewis liver allograft recipients 
suffer from severe rejection (12). The present study included 
a tolerance group (Lewis into DA, n=5) and rejection group 
(DA into Lewis, n=5). The liver transplantation was performed 
according to the ‘2 cuff technique’ of Kamada and Calne (13). 
Briefly, after anesthesia and systemic heparinization, the livers 
were removed from the donors and prepared in 4˚C Ringer's 
solution. The grafts were then implanted into the recipients by 
anastomosis of the suprahepatic vena cava using a continuous 
everting suture, reconstruction of the portal vein and infra￾hepatic vena cava by the cuff technique and connection of 
bile duct by an end‑to‑end anastomosis over an indwelling 
stent without hepatic artery reconstruction. After surgery, the 
recipients were kept warm by lighting and had free access to 
food and water. Rats deaths within 5 days after transplanta￾tion were considered to be due to technical failures and hence 
excluded from the study.
Histological examination. Tissue specimens from the liver 
grafts were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin and 
used for histological examination. The specimens were then 
sliced into 5‑µm sections and stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) for routine histological examination.
Isolation of HSCs. On the 7th day after transplantation, 
the recipient rats were sacrificed. A 0.5x1.0 cm liver tissue 
specimen was obtained from each liver graft for histological 
examination. HSCs were then extracted from the left liver 
tissue as previously described (14‑16). Briefly, the grafts 
underwent serial in situ perfusions with 70 ml 0.1% pronase 
at a flow rate of 10‑15 ml/min for 7 min and 60 ml 0.05% 
collagenase IV (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a flow rate of 
10‑15 ml/min for 20 min. The liver tissue was then digested in 
50 ml buffer solution containing collagenase IV, pronase and 
DNase (Sigma), followed by density gradient centrifugation 
and 11% Nycodenz (Axis‑Shield PoC, Oslo, Norway) gradient 
centrifugation. The harvested HSCs were resuspended in 
high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 
Gibco‑BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 20% fetal calf 
serum (FCS). The viability of HSCs was >90% as determined 
using trypan blue exclusion and the purity of HSCs ranged 
from 90 to 95% as determined by desmin immunostaining. 
The typical light microscopic appearance of a lipid droplet 
was as described previously (17). The HSCs were cultured in 
DMEM containing 20% FCS for 7 days for further study.
Preparation of T cells. The spleens of the recipient rats were 
removed on the 7th day after transplantation and single spleen 
cell (SC) suspensions were prepared. Following lysis of red 
blood cells and density gradient centrifugation, T cells were 
isolated and purified using an adherence culture in DMEM 
containing 10% FCS and a nylon wool column.
FasL expression in HSCs. HSCs (2.5x104
) were incubated 
with mitomycin C (10 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37˚C in a 5% 
CO2‑humidified air atmosphere. Then, HSCs were stained with 
Hamster monoclonal anti‑rat FasL‑specific IgG (eBioscience, 
San Diego, CA, USA) followed by a second fluorescein‑labeled 
antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). The FasL 
expression levels of the HSCs were determined by flow cytom￾etry according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Flow cytometry analysis for alloreactive T‑cell apoptosis. 
After incubating with mitomycin C (10 µg/ml) for 30 min, the 
HSCs (2.5x104
) were resuspended in 100 µl DMEM containing 
10% FCS and then co‑cultured with 100 µl T cells (5x105
) in 
the presence or absence of FasL blocking mAb for 24 h. All 
cultures were incubated at 37˚C in a 5% CO2‑humidified air 
atmosphere. The nonadherent cells were isolated and the apop￾totic T cells stained with anti‑CD3 mAb (eBioscience) and 
Annexin V‑FITC/PI (BD Pharmingen) were determined by 
flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cytokine quantitation. A two‑way mixed lymphocyte reaction 
(MLR) was performed and 2.5x105
 Lewis and 2.5x105
 DA 
SCs were co‑cultured in 96‑well plates (200 µl) in DMEM 
containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml 
streptomycin, in the presence of 2.5x104
 HSCs. This co‑culture 
was incubated at 37˚C in a 5% CO2‑humidified air atmosphere 
for 5 days. The IL‑2, IL‑10, TNF‑α and TGF‑β levels in 
the supernatant of this co‑culture were quantified using the 
respective ELISA kits (Biosource International Inc, Camarillo, 
CA, USA). A standard curve using recombinant cytokine was 
generated for each assay.
Statistical analysis. The data are presented as the mean ± stan￾dard deviation (SD). The statistical significance of the parametric 
data was determined using the Student's t‑test. P<0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Histological characteristics of the liver grafts. Histological 
analysis confirmed that the liver grafts of the rejection group 
underwent serious acute rejection, while those of the toler￾ance group did not. In the rejection group, the H&E staining 
results showed severe acute rejection, which was character￾ized by extensive T‑cell infiltration of the portal tracts; bile 
duct damage; vacuolar degeneration, karyopycnosis and even 
necrosis of hepatocytes. Meanwhile, the tolerance group 
exhibited only minimal T‑cell infiltration without portal tract 
involvement and the hepatic parenchyma exhibited no signifi￾cant damage (Fig. 1).
HSCs induce T‑cell apoptosis through the Fas/FasL pathway. 
As T‑cell apoptosis is a well‑established mechanism of liver 
immunotolerance (18), we hypothesized that HSCs may 
contribute to liver immunotolerance by inducing T‑cell apop-

tosis. The results indicated that the HSCs of the tolerance group 
had significantly higher FasL expression than the rejection 
group (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the results also showed that the 
HSCs of the tolerance group were able to markedly enhance 
the apoptosis of T cells, suggesting that the immunosuppres￾sive effect of HSCs may induce T‑cell apoptosis (Fig. 3). 
The Fas/FasL is a well‑known pathway of apoptosis (19). To 
determine whether Fas/FasL was critical in HSC‑induced 
T‑cell apoptosis, HSCs were co‑cultured with T cells in the 
presence or absence of FasL blocking mAb. FasL blocking 
mAb partially but significantly inhibited T‑cell apoptosis in 
the tolerance group (P<0.05) and had little effect in the rejec￾tion group (P>0.05; Figs. 4 and 5).
HSCs promote Th2/Th3‑like cell cytokine production in the 
tolerance group. The IL‑2, TNF‑α, TGF‑β and IL‑10 cytokine 
levels in the supernatant of the MLR cultures in the presence 
of HSCs were measured using ELISA assays. The results 
indicated that there were no significant differences in the Th1 
cytokine (IL‑2 and TNF‑α) levels between the tolerance and 
rejection groups (P>0.05). However, in the tolerance group, 
the Th2‑like cell cytokine IL‑10 and Th3‑like cell cytokine 
TGF‑β levels were markedly increased (P<0.05; Fig. 6).
Discussion
Unlike other solid organs, liver allografts may be spontane￾ously accepted without IS in a number of species, including 
humans, demonstrating that the liver is an immunoprivileged 
organ (1,20‑22). Moreover, an accumulating amount of 
evidence suggests that NPCs, such as DCs, KCs and LSECs, 
are critical in liver transplant immunotolerance (23‑25). HSCs 
are a type of NPC, well known for their key role in liver 
fibrogenesis. Additionally, HSCs have been demonstrated to 
be immunoregulating (8‑10).
In the present study, the activated HSCs from the tolerance 
group had an increased T‑cell apoptosis-inducing activity, 
indicating that activated HSCs have an immune suppressive 
function, since induced T‑cell apoptosis is a significant mecha￾nism in the development of immune tolerance (18). The present
data also showed that in the tolerance group, the expression of 
FasL by HSCs was significantly higher than in the rejection 
group. Moreover, FasL blocking mAb partially but significantly 
reversed HSC‑induced T‑cell apoptosis in the tolerance group 
but not in the rejection group, suggesting that the Fas/FasL 
pathway is associated with HSC‑induced T‑cell apoptosis. It 
is generally accepted that Fas and FasL interactions are key 
to cell apoptosis and maintain the immunoprivilege (19). 
Moreover, other studies have revealed that the Fas system is 
involved in liver transplant immune regulation. Specifically, 
FasL expressed by infiltrating cells induces liver cell apop￾tosis during acute rejection following liver transplantation. 
However, the increased expression of FasL in liver allografts 
results in immunotolerance by combining with Fas expressed 
by the infiltrating lymphocytes (26,27). This phenomenon may 
be explained by the expression of FasL gradually switching 
from infiltrating cells to hepatocytes. Sun et al observed that 
KCs in the liver downregulate the T‑cell response via the 
Fas/FasL pathway following liver transplantation. The authors 
results indicated that the Fas/FasL pathway was involved in 
the immunotolerance of liver transplantation (24). However, 
FasL may not be the only molecule involved in the immuno￾suppressive effect of HSCs, since the blocking of FasL only 
partially reversed HSC‑induced T‑cell apoptosis. Studies 
have further demonstrated that the upregulation of B7‑H1 
suppresses T‑cell proliferation, promotes T‑cell apoptosis and 
induces the production of various cytokines by combining

with programmed death‑1 (PD‑1) B and T lymphocyte attenu￾ator. Therefore, B7‑H1 is considerably involved in peripheral 
immune tolerance and tumor immune evasion (28,29). B7‑H1 
negatively regulates the immune system and inhibits T‑cell 
activity, mainly at the effect phase since B7‑H1 receptor PD‑1 
is inducibly expressed on activated T cells(30‑32). Deficiencies 
of B7‑H1 lead to the accumulation of CD8+
 T cells in the 
liver, suggesting a role for B7‑H1 in the regulation of T‑cell 
homeostasis (33). A study by Yu et al showed that quiescent 
HSCs express very low levels of B7‑H1, while B7‑H1 expres￾sion in HSCs may be notably increased by various stimuli and 
the inhibition of B7‑H1 may partially reduce HSC‑induced 
T‑cell apoptosis (9). Therefore, we propose that the B7‑H1 
and Fas/FasL pathways are involved in HSC‑induced immune 
suppression.
The present study also showed that there were higher IL‑10 
and TGF‑β levels in the supernatant of the MLR cultures of 
HSC and T cells from the tolerance group. We hypothesize that 
HSCs may drive the T‑cell subset differentiation of Th2/Th3 
cells or activate the production of inhibitory cytokines, such as 
IL‑10 and/or TGF‑β, by HSCs. Th1‑like cell cytokines mediate 
cellular immunity and enhance rejection, while Th2‑like cell 
cytokines downregulate the activity of Th1‑like cells and cyto￾toxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and attenuate post‑transplantation 
rejection. It has been reported that IL‑10 and TGF‑β contrib￾uted to liver transplant immunotolerance (34,35). Studies have 
also demonstrated that KCs and LSECs negatively regulate the 
immune response by secreting TGF‑β (35). Therefore, HSCs 
may regulate the immune response following liver transplanta￾tion by regulating Th2/Th3‑like cell cytokine production.

In conclusion, the present study revealed that HSCs 
contribute to liver transplant immunotolerance by inducing 
T‑cell apoptosis and stimulating Th2/Th3‑like cell cytokine 
production. This immunosuppressive activity of HSCs 
provides a supplementary mechanism for the development of 
immunotolerance following liver transplantation.
