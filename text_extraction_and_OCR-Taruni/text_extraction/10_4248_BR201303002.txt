The role of Bone Tissue Engineering in the field of Regenerative Medicine has been the topic of substantial 
research over the past two decades. Technological advances have improved orthopaedic implants and surgical 
techniques for bone reconstruction. However, improvements in surgical techniques to reconstruct bone have 
been limited by the paucity of autologous materials available and donor site morbidity. Recent advances in the 
development of biomaterials have provided attractive alternatives to bone grafting expanding the surgical 
options for restoring the form and function of injured bone. Specifically, novel bioactive (second generation) 
biomaterials have been developed that are characterised by controlled action and reaction to the host tissue 
environment, whilst exhibiting controlled chemical breakdown and resorption with an ultimate replacement by 
regenerating tissue. Future generations of biomaterials (third generation) are designed to be not only osteo￾conductive but also osteoinductive, i.e. to stimulate regeneration of host tissues by combining tissue engineer￾ing and in situ tissue regeneration methods with a focus on novel applications. These techniques will lead to 
novel possibilities for tissue regeneration and repair. At present, tissue engineered constructs that may find 
future use as bone grafts for complex skeletal defects, whether from post-traumatic, degenerative, neoplastic or 
congenital/developmental “origin” require osseous reconstruction to ensure structural and functional integrity. 
Engineering functional bone using combinations of cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors is a promising strategy 
and a particular feature for future development in the area of hybrid materials which are able to exhibit suitable 
biomimetic and mechanical properties. This review will discuss the state of the art in this field and what we can 
expect from future generations of bone regeneration concepts.

cribe the state of the art of the bone tissue engineering 
field and present a perspective of its role in Tissue 
Engineering & Regenerative Medicine 3.0. Over the last 
ten years remarkable progress has been made in the 
development of surgical techniques for bone recons￾truction. Although these sophisticated techniques have 
transformed reconstructive surgery and significantly im￾proved clinical outcomes, they have already reached a 
number of their practical limits to further improve health-

care outcomes. Today major reconstructive surgeries 
(due to trauma or tumour removal) are still limited by the 
paucity of autologous materials available and donor 
site morbidity. Recent advances in the development of 
scaffold-based Tissue Engineering (TE) have given the 
surgeon new options for restoring form and function. 
There are now bioactive biomaterials (second gener￾ation) available that elicit a controlled action and 
reaction to the host tissue environment with a controlled 
chemical breakdown and resorption to ultimately be 
replaced by regenerating tissue. Third-generation bio￾materials are now being designed to stimulate regen￾eration of living tissues using tissue engineering and in situ
tissue regeneration methods. Engineering functional 
bone using combinations of cells, scaffolds and bio￾active factors are seen as a promising approach and 
these techniques will undoubtedly lead to ceaseless 
possibilities for tissue regeneration and repair. There are 
currently thousands of research papers and reviews 
available on bone tissue engineering, but there is still a 
major discrepancy between scientific research efforts on 
bone tissue engineering and the clinical application of 
such strategies. There is an evident lack of compre￾hensive reviews that cover both the scientific research 
aspect as well as the clinical translation and practical 
application of bone tissue engineering techniques. This 
review will therefore discuss the state of the art of 
scientific bone tissue engineering concepts and will also 
provide current approaches and future perspectives for 
the clinical application of bone tissue engineering.
Bone biology
Bone as an organ has next to its complex cellular com￾position a highly specialised organic-inorganic archi￾tecture which can be classified as micro- and nano￾composite tissue. Its mineralised matrix consists of 1) an 
organic phase (mainly collagen, 35% dry weight) res￾ponsible for its rigidity, viscoelasticity and toughness; 2) a 
mineral phase of carbonated apatite (65% dry weight) 
for structural reinforcement, stiffness and mineral homeo￾stasis; and 3) other non-collagenous proteins that form a 
microenvironment stimulatory to cellular functions (2).
Bone tissue exhibits a distinct hierarchical structural or￾ganization of its constituents on numerous levels includ￾ing macrostructure (cancellous and cortical bone), 
microstructure (Harversian systems, osteons, single trabe￾culae), sub-microstructure (lamellae), nanostructure 
(fibrillar collagen and embedded minerals) and sub￾nanostructure (molecular structure of constituent ele￾ments, such as mineral, collagen, and non-collagenous 
organic proteins) (Figure 1) (3). Macroscopically, bone 
consists of a dense hard cylindrical shell of cortical bone 
along the shaft of the bone that becomes thinner with 
greater distance from the centre of the shaft towards 
the articular surfaces. Cortical bone encompasses 
increasing amounts of porous trabecular bone (also 
called cancellous or spongy bone) at the proximal and 
distal ends to optimise articular load transfer (2). In 
humans, trabecular bone has a porosity of 50-90% with 
an average trabecular spacing of around 1mm and an 
average density of approximately 0.2 g·cm-3 (4-6). Corti￾cal bone has a much denser structure with a porosity of 
3-12% and an average density of 1.80g·cm-3 (5, 7).
On a microscopic scale, trabecular struts and dense 
cortical bone are composed of mineralized collagen 
fibres stacked parallel to form layers, called lamellae 
(3–7 µm thick) and then stacked in a±45° manner (2). In 
mature bone these lamellae wrap in concentric layers 
(3–8 lamellae) around a central part named Haversian 
canal which containings nerve and blood vessels to 
form what is called an Osteon (or a Haversian system), a 
cylindrical structure running roughly parallel to the long 
axis of the bone (3). Cancellous bone consists of inter￾connecting framework of rod and plate shaped trabe￾culae. On a nanostructural level, the most prominent 
structures are the collagen fibres, surrounded and infil￾trated by mineral. At the sub-nanostructural level three 
main materials are bone crystals, collagen molecules, 
and non-collagenous organic proteins. For further details 
the reader is referred to (3).
Mineralised bone matrix is populated with four bone￾active cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and 
bone lining cells. Additional cell types are contained 
within the bone marrow that fills the central intra￾medullary canal of the bone shaft and intertrabecular 
spaces near the articular surfaces (8). Bone has to be 
defined as an organ composed of different tissues and 
also serves as a mineral deposit affected and utilised by 
the body’s endocrine system to regulate (among others) 
calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the circulating 
body fluids. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that 
bone exerts an endocrine function itself by producing 
hormones that regulate phosphate and glucose homeo￾stasis integrating the skeleton in the global mineral and 
nutrient homeostasis (9).
Bone is a highly dynamic form of connective tissue 
which undergoes continuous remodelling (the orches￾trated removal of bone by osteoclasts followed by the 
formation of new bone by osteoblasts) to optimally adapt 
its structure to changing functional demands (mechani￾cal loading, nutritional status etc.). From a material sci￾ence point of view bone matrix is a composite material 
of a polymer-ceramic lamellar fibre-matrix and each of

these design and material aspects influence the me￾chanical properties of the bone tissue (10). The me￾chanical properties depend on the bone composition 
(porosity, mineralisation etc.) as well as the structural 
organisation (trabecular or cortical bone architecture, 
collagen fibre orientation, fatigue damage etc.) (11). 
Collagen possesses a Young’s modulus of 1-2 GPa and 
an ultimate tensile strength of 50-1 000 MPa, compared 
to the mineral hydroxyapatite which has a Young’s 
modulus of ~130 GPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 
~100 MPa. The resulting mechanical properties of the 
two types of bone tissue, namely the cortical bone and 
cancellous bone, are shown in Table 1. Age and related 
changes in bone density have been reported to sub￾stantially influence the mechanical properties of cance￾llous bone (12). As outlined above, bone shows a distinct 
hierarchical structural organization and it is therefore 
important to also define the mechanical properties at 
microstructural levels (Table 2). Although the cancellous 
and cortical bone may be of the same kind of material, 
the maturation of the cortical bone material may alter 
the mechanical properties at the microstructural level.
Bone tissue is also known to be mechano-receptive; 
both normal bone remodelling and fracture or defect 
healing are influenced by mechanical stimuli applied at 
the regenerating defect site and surrounding bone tissue
(17-20). In contrast to most other organs in the human 
body, bone tissue is capable of true regeneration, i.e. 
healing without the formation of fibrotic scar tissue (21). 
During the healing process basic steps of fetal bone 
development are recapitulated and bone regenerated 
in this way does not differ structurally or mechanically 
from the surrounding undamaged bone tissue (22). How￾ever, despite this tremendous regenerative capacity,

5-10% of all fractures are prone to delayed bony union 
or will progress towards a non-union and the develop￾ment of a pseudarthrosis (23-24). Together with large 
traumatic bone defects and extensive loss of bone 
substance after tumour resection or revision surgery after 
failed arthroplasties, these pathological conditions still 
represent a major challenge in today’s clinical practice. 
The range of bone graft materials available to treat such 
problems in modern clinical practice essentially include 
autologous bone (from the same patient), allogeneic 
bone (from a donor), and demineralised bone matrices, 
as well as a wide range of synthetic bone substitute 
biomaterials such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and 
composite materials. During the last decades, tissue 
engineering strategies to restore clinical function have 
raised considerable scientific and commercial interest in 
the field of orthopaedic surgery as well as reconstructive 
and oromaxillofacial surgery. Yet, the treatment of bone 
defects and the search for bone substitute materials is 
not just a modern day phenomenon, with its history 
reaching back through millennia.
Bone grafting and bone substitutes in the last
4 000 years
The quest for the most efficient way to substitute for lost 
bone and to develop the best bone replacement 
material has been pursued by humans for thousands of 
years. 
In Peru, archaeologists discovered the skull of a tribal 
chief from 2000 BC in which a frontal bone defect 
(presumably from trepanation) had been covered with 
a 1 mm-thick plate of hammered gold (25). Trephined 
Incan skulls have been found with plates made from 
shells, gourds, and silver or gold plates covering the 
defect areas (26). In a skull found in the ancient center 
of Ishtkunui (Armenia) from approx. 2000 BC, a 7 mm 
diameter skull defect had been bridged with a piece of 
animal bone (27). These pursuits are not limited to skull 
surgeries involving bone substitutes. Ancient Egyptians 
have been shown to have profound knowledge of 
orthopaedic und traumatological procedures with Sur￾geons having implanted iron prostheses for knee joint 
replacement as early as 600 BC, as analyses of preserved 
human mummies have revealed (28).
The first modern era report of a bone xenograft pro￾cedure is believed to be the Dutch surgeon Job Jans￾zoon van Meekeren in 1668 (29-30). A skull defect of a 
Russian nobleman was successfully treated with a bone 
xenograft taken from the calvaria of a deceased dog. 
The xenograft was reported to have become fully 
incorporated into the skull of the patient. In the 1800s, 
plaster of Paris (Calcium sulphate) was used to fill bone 
cavities in patients suffering from Tuberculosis (31). 
Attempts were also made to fill bone defects with 
cylinders made from ivory (32). In 1820 the German sur￾geon Phillips von Walters described the first clinical use of 
a bone autograft to reconstruct skull defects in patients 
after trepanation (33). Walters successfully repaired tre￾panation holes, following surgery to relieve intracranial 
pressure, with pieces of bone taken from the patient’s 
own head. In 1881, Scottish surgeon William MacEwen 
described the first allogenic bone grafting procedure: 
He used tibial bone wedges from three donors that had 
undergone surgery for skeletal deformity correction 
(caused by rickets) to reconstruct an infected humerus 
in a 3-year-old child (34)
Major contributions leading to the development of 
modern day bone grafting procedures and bone sub￾stitutes have been made by Ollier and Barth in the late 
1800s. Louis Léopold Ollier carried out extensive experi￾ments to study the osteogenic properties of the peri￾osteum and other various approaches to new bone for￾mation, mainly in rabbit and dog models. He also meti￾culously reviewed the literature on bone regeneration 
available at that time and in 1867 he published his
1 000-page textbook ‘Traite experimentel et clinique de 
la regeneration des os et de la production artificielle du 
tissu osseux’, in which he described the term ‘bone graft’ 
(“greffe osseuse”) for the first time (35). In 1895 the Ger￾man surgeon Arthur Barth published his treatise ‘Ueber 
histologische Befunde nach Knochenimplantationen’
(‘On histological findings after bone implantations’) 
presenting his results of various bone grafting procedures 
involving the skull and long bones (humerus, forearm 
bones) of dogs and rabbits including histological assess￾ment (36). Today, both Ollier’s and Barth’s work are con￾sidered to be milestones in the development of present 
day bone grafting procedures and bone substitute 
materials. 
With the development of new orthopaedic techniques 
and increased numbers of joint replacement procedures 
(prostheses), the demand for bone grafts increased in 
the 20th century, leading to the opening of the first bone 
bank for allogenic bone grafts in New York in 1945 (37).
But the risk of an immunological reaction from transplant￾ed allogenic bone material was soon recognized and 
addressed in various studies (38-39). Several procedures 
such as the use of hydrogen peroxide to macerate 
bone grafts (“Kieler Span”) in the 1950s and 1960s to 
overcome antigenity were not successful (40-41). Today, 
bone substitute materials such as (bovine) bone chips 
are routinely used in clinical practice after being pre￾treated to remove antigen structures. However, due to 

Bone tissue engineering

the processing steps necessary to abolish antigenicity, 
most of these grafts do not contain viable cells or growth 
factors and are therefore inferior to viable autologous 
bone graft options. When allografts with living cells are 
transplanted, there is a risk of transmitting viral and bac￾terial infections: Transmission of human immunodefici￾ency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-lympho￾zytic virus (HTLV), unspecified hepatitis, tuberculosis and 
other bacteria has been documented (mainly) for allo￾grafts (mainly from those containing viable cells) (42).
As early as 1932, the work of the Swiss H. Matti proved 
the paramount meaning of autologous cancellous bone 
grafts for bone regeneration approaches (43). Having 
conducted various experiments on the osteogenic 
potential of autologous and allogenic bone, Schwei￾berer concluded in 1970 that the autologous transplant 
remains the only really reliable transplantation material 
of the future, if applied to bring about new bone forma￾tion or crucially to support the bridging bone defects
(44). Even though this statement was made more than 
50 years ago, it still remains valid today, when bone is still 
the second most transplanted material, second only to 
blood. Worldwide more than 3.5 million bone grafts 
(either autografts or allografts) are performed each year
(45). Recent advances in technology and surgical 
pro-cedures have significantly increased the options for 
bone grafting material, with novel products designed to 
replace both the structural properties of bone, as well as 
promote faster integration and healing. The number of 
procedures requiring bone substitutes is increasing, and 
will continue to do so as the population ages and physi￾cal activity of the elderly population increases. Therefore, 
while the current bone grafting market globally is esti￾mated to be in excess of $2.5 billion US each year, it is 
expected to increase at a compound annual growth 
rate of 7-8% (45).
Although the last decades have seen numerous inno￾vations in bone substitute materials, the treatment of 
bone defects with autologous bone grafting material is 
still considered to be the ‘Gold Standard’ against which 
all other methods are compared (46). Autologous bone 
combines all the properties desired in a bone grafting 
material: It provides a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells 
necessary for bone regeneration (=osteoconductive); it 
promotes the proliferation of stem cells and their differen￾tiation into osteogenic cells (=osteoinductive) and it 
holds viable cells that can form new bone tissue (= osteo￾genic) (22, 47). However, the available volume of auto￾logous bone graft from a patient is limited and an 
additional surgical procedure is required to harvest the 
grafting material which is associated with a significant 
risk of donor site morbidity. 20-30% of autograft patients 
experience morbidity such as chronic pain or dysaesthe￾sia at the graft-harvesting site (48). Large bone defects 
(>5 cm) may be treated with bone segment transport or 
free vascularized bone transfer (49), as the use of an 
autologous bone graft alone is not recommended 
because of the risk of graft resorption despite good soft 
tissue coverage (50). The vascularised fibula autograft
(51) and the Ilizarov method (52-54) are the most com￾monly used treatment methods for larger bone defects; 
however, complications are common and the process 
can be laborious and painful for the patient as she/he 
may be required to use external fixation systems for up 
to one and half years (49, 55-56).
The limitations of existing bone grafting procedures, 
either autologous or allogenic in nature, and the in￾creased demand for bone grafts in limb salvage sur￾geries for bone tumours and in revision surgeries of failed 
arthroplasties have renewed the interest in bone sub￾stitute materials and alternative bone grafting proce￾dures (57). In 1986, Masquelet and colleagues (58) first 
described a new two-stage technique taking advan￾tage of the body’s immune response to foreign materials 
for bone reconstruction. The authors called it the ‘con￾cept of induced membranes’ – soon to become known 
as the ‘Masquelet technique’: In a first step, a radical 
debridement of necrotic bone and soft tissue is followed 
by the filling of the defect site with a polymethylmetha￾crylate (PMMA) spacer and stabilisation with an external 
fixator. After the definitive healing of the soft tissue, a 
second procedure is performed 6-8 weeks later, when 
the PMMA spacer is removed and a morcellised can￾cellous bone graft (from the iliac crest) is inserted into 
the cavitiy (59-60). The cement spacer was initially 
thought to prevent the collapse of the soft tissue into the 
bone defect and to prepare the space for bone recon￾struction. However, it was soon discovered that the 
PMMA spacer does not only serve as a place holder, but 
that a foreign body reaction to the spacer also induces 
the formation of a membrane that possesses highly 
desirable properties for bone regeneration (60-61): The 
induced membrane was shown to be richly vascularised 
in all layers; the inner membrane layer (facing the ce￾ment) composed of synovial like epithelium and the out 
part is made from fibroblasts, myoblasts and collagen. 
The induced membrane has also been shown to secrete 
various growth factors in a time-dependent manner:
High concentrations of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) as well as transforming growth factor β 
(TGF β) are secreted as early as the second week after 
implantation of the PMMA spacer; bone morphogene￾tic protein 2 (BMP-2) concentration peaks at the fourth 
week. The induced membrane stimulates the prolifera-

221
tion of bone marrow cells and differentiation towards an 
osteoblastic lineage. Finally, clinical experience has 
shown that the cancellous bone inside the induced 
membrane is not subject to resorption by the body. Ever 
since its introduction the ‘induced membrane’-technique 
has been used very successfully in various clinical cases 
(see (59) and references therein). However, the Mas￾quelet technique still requires the harvesting of an auto￾logous bone graft, and with that come all the potential 
aforementioned complications. Furthermore, the use of 
alternate bone substitute materials, such as hydroxy￾apatite tricalcium phosphate, in combination with the 
Masquelet technique has so far yielded results inferior to 
the use the Masquelet technique with autologous bone 
grafting material (59, 62).
Besides the Masquelet technique, a more recent inno￾vation has also significantly improved the clinical 
approach to restoring bone defects. The development 
of the Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator (RIA©)-System (DePuy￾Synthes) has given clinicians an alternative to iliac crest 
harvesting to retrieve bone grafting materials from pati￾ents: The RIA System provides irrigation and aspiration 
during intramedullay reaming, allowing the harvesting of 
finely morselised autologous bone and bone marrow for 
surgical procedures requiring bone grafting material (63). 
The RIA was initially developed to lower the intramedu￾llary pressure during the reaming of long bones to re￾duce the risk of fat embolisms and pulmonary compli￾cations such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom 
(ARDS), as well as to reduce local thermal necrosis of 
bone tissue (64-65). However, the finely morselised auto￾logous bone and bone marrow that is collected by the 
RIA has been shown to be rich in stem cells, osteogenic 
cells and growth factors and has been recognized to be 
a suitable bone graft alternative to the iliac crest auto￾graft tissue (66-67). Also, RIA enables the harvesting of 
larger bone graft volumes compared to the iliac crest 
(approx. 40 cm3 for the femur and 33 cm3 for the tibia)
(48, 65). Furthermore, the risk of complications from the 
harvesting procedure has been reduced significantly 
(RIA 6% vs. 19.37% for iliac crest autografts) (68). Since its 
introduction, the indications for use of RIA have been 
further extended to include the treatment of postopera￾tive osteomyelitis (69) and the harvesting of mesenchy￾mal stem cells (MSCs) (70). The innovation driven by the 
RIA systems was so significant, that the Journal “Injury” 
has dedicated a complete issue to the data available 
on RIA and its applications recently (71). A systematic 
review on the Reamer-irrigator-aspirator indications and 
clinical results has recently been published by Cox et al
(72). The Masquelet technique as well as the RIA-system 
is nowadays frequently used in clinical practice, in￾dependently. However, the two techniques may also be 
combined to further improve their effectiveness when 
treating severe bone defects, for example in post￾traumatic limb reconstruction (73). An example of a 
case from one of our author’s clinical practice (M.S.) 
combining the use of Masquelet technique and the use 
of the RIA-system to treat a complex case of tibial non￾union is provided in Figure 2.
Both the Masquelet technique and the development 
of the RIA-system represent significant improvements in 
today’s clinical approach to bone reconstruction and 
regeneration. However, utilising these techniques, we 
have still not been able to replace autologous bone 
grafting in order to avoid surgical graft retrieval proce￾dures with all the associated disadvantages. However, 
with research looking towards increasingly sophisticated 
bone tissue engineering techniques and their first clinical 
applications, the quest for developing improved bone 
substitute material advances to the next level.
Bone substitute materials (BSM)
Bone substitutes can be defined as “a synthetic, in￾organic or biologically organic combination-biomaterial￾which can be inserted for the treatment of a bone de￾fect instead of autogenous or allogenous bone” (74). This 
definition applies to numerous substances and a variety 
of materials have been used over time in an attempt to 
substitute bone tissue. Although merely of historic interest 
and with no significance in modern therapies, the use of 
seashells, nuts, gourds and so forth show that humans 
have strived for BSM for thousands of years. 
With the introduction of tissue engineering and its clini￾cal application the regenerative medicine in 1993 (75)
the modern day quest for BSMs has undergone a signifi￾cant change. The limitations of current clinical approa￾ches have necessitated the development of alternative 
bone repair techniques and have driven the develop￾ment of scaffold-based tissue engineering strategies. In 
the past, mostly inert bone substitute materials have 
been used, functioning mainly as space holders during 
the healing processes. Now a paradigm shift has taken 
place towards the use of new ‘intelligent’ tissue engineer￾ing biomaterials that would support and even promote
tissue re-growth (76).
According to the “diamond concept” of bone tissue 
engineering (77-78), an ideal bone substitute material 
should offer an osteoinductive three-dimensional struc￾ture, contain osteogenic cells and osteoinductive factors, 
have sufficient mechanical properties and promote 
vascularisation. Despite extensive research in the field of 
bone tissue engineering, apart from the “gold standard”

autograft bone, no currently available BSM can offer 
these properties in one single material. Therefore, the 
fundamental concept underlying tissue engineering is to 
combine a scaffold or three-dimensional construct with 
living cells, and/or biologically active molecules to form 
a “tissue engineering construct” (TEC), which promotes 
the repair and/or regeneration of tissues (79-80).
Currently used BSM can be classified into different sub￾groups according to their origin (76, 81):
1) BSM of natural origin
This group consists of harvested autogenous bone grafts 
as well as allogenic BSM, such demineralised bone ma￾trix, corticocancellous or cortical grafts, cancellous chips 
(from either cadavers or living donors) (82-84). Xenogenic 
materials, for example porous natural bone hydroxyapa￾tite from animal bones (bovine, equine, porcine etc.) 
are also part of this group (85). Phytogenic materials 
such as bone-analogue calcium phosphate originally 
obtained from marine algae or coral derived materials, 
also fall into this category (86-87).
2) Synthetic (alloplastic) materials
This groups contains ceramics such as bioactive glasses
(88), Tricalciumphosphates (TCP) (89-90), Hydroxyapatite 
(HA) (91-93) and glass ionomer cements as well as Cal￾cium Phosphate (CP) ceramics (94). Metals such as 
titanium also belong to this group. Furthermore polymers 
including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polylactides/
poliglycolides and copolymers as well as polycapro￾lactone (PCL) (95) are summarised in this group (76, 79, 
96-97).
3) Composite materials
BSM combining different materials such as ceramics and 
polymers are referred to as composite materials (92, 
98-99). By merging materials with different structural and 
biochemical properties into composite materials, the 
properties of composite materials can be modified to 
achieve more favourable characteristics, for instance 
with respect to biodegradability (79, 97).
4) BSM combined with growth factors
Natural or recombinant growth factors such a bone 
morphogenic protein (BMP), platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-β), 
insulin-like growth-factor 1, vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor can be add￾ed to increase the biological activity of BSM (100-101). 
For example, a composite material made of medical￾grade polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (mPCL￾TCP) scaffolds (combined with recombinant human 
BMP-7) has been demonstrated to completely bridge a 
critical-sized (3 cm) tibial defect in a sheep model (102).
5) BSM with living cells
Mesenchymal stem cells (103-105), bone marrow stromal
cells (106-107), periosteal cells (108-109), osteoblasts (110)
and embryonic (111) as well as adult stem cells (112)
have been used in bone tissue engineering (22, 101, 
113-116). These cells can generate new tissue alone or 
can be used in combination with scaffold matrices.
BSMs can also be classified according to their proper￾ties of action. An overview of the currently available BSM 
for clinical (orthopaedic) use and their mode of action is 
given in Table 3 (reproduced from (117)).
Three-dimensional scaffolds in bone tissue 
engineering
Scaffolds serve as three-dimensional structures to guide 
cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. In load 
bearing tissues, it also serves as temporary mechanical 
support structure. Scaffolds substitute for the function of 
the extracellular matrix and need to fulfil highly specific 
criteria. An ideal scaffold should be (i) three-dimensional 
and highly porous with an interconnected pore network 
for cell growth and flow transport of nutrients and meta￾bolic waste; (ii) should have surface properties which 
are optimized for the attachment, migration, prolifera￾tion and differentiation of cell types of interest (depend￾ing on the targeted tissue); (iii) be biocompatible, not 
elicit an immune response and be biodegradable with a 
controllable degradation rate to compliment cell/tissue 
in-growth and maturation; (iv) its mechanical properties 
should match those of the tissue at the site of implanta￾tion and (v) the scaffold structure should be easily and 
efficiently reproducible in various shapes and sizes (97).
Biocompatibility
Biocompatibility represents the ability of a material to 
perform with an appropriate response in a specific appli￾cation (118). As a general rule, scaffolds should be fabri￾cated from materials that do not have the potential to 
elicit immunological or clinically detectable primary or 
secondary foreign body reactions (119). Parallel to the 
formation of new tissue in vivo, the scaffold may under￾go degradation via the release of by-products that are 
either biocompatible without proof of elimination from 
the body (biodegradable scaffolds) or can be eliminated 
through natural pathways from the body, either by sim￾ple filtration of by-products or after their metabolisation 
(bioresorbable scaffolds) (97). Due to poor vascularisation 
or low metabolic activity, the capacity of the surround￾ing tissue to eliminate the by-products may be low lead￾ing to a build up of the by-products thereby causing 
local temporary disturbances (97): A massive in vivo
release of acidic degradation by-products leading to
inflammatory reactions has been reported for several

Another example is the increase of osmotic pressure or 
pH caused by local fluid accumulation or transient sinus 
formation from fibre reinforced polyglycolide pins used 
in orthopaedic applications (120). It is also known that 
calcium phosphate biomaterial particles can cause 
inflammatory reactions after being implanted (although 
this inflammatory reaction may be considered desirable 
to a certain extent as it subsequently stimulates osteo￾progenitor cell differentiation and bone matrix deposi￾tion) (123). These examples illustrate that potential pro￾blems related to biocompatibility in tissue engineering 
constructs for bone and cartilage applications may be 
related to the use of biodegradable, erodible and bio￾resorbable polymer scaffolds. Therefore, it is important 
that the three dimensional Tissue Engineering Construct 
(TEC) is exposed at all times to sufficient quantities of 
neutral culture media when undertaking cell culture 
procedures, especially during the period where the 
mass loss of the polymer matrix occurs (97). For applica￾tions in vivo, it is of course not possible to expose the TEC 
to neutral media, and one therefore has to carefully 
take into account the local specifications (pH, vascula￾risation, metabolic activity etc) of the tissue to be en￾gineered when accessing biocompatibility of a TEC.
Mechanical properties and degradation kinetics
The design of tissue engineering scaffolds needs to con￾sider physico-chemical properties, morphology and bio￾mechanical properties as well as degradation kinetics. 
The scaffold structure is expected to guide the develop￾ment of new bone formation by promoting attachment, 
migration, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells. 
Parallel to tissue formation, the scaffold should also 
undergo degradation in order to allow for ultimate 
replacement of scaffold material with newly formed, 
tissue engineered bone. Furthermore, the scaffold is also 
responsible for (temporal) mechanical support and 
stability at the tissue engineering site until the new bone 
is fully matured and is able to withstand mechanical 
load. As a general rule, the scaffold material should be 
sufficiently robust to resist changes in shape resulting 
from the introduction of cells into the scaffold (each of 
which should capable of exerting tractional forces) and 
from wound contraction forces that would be evoked 
during tissue healing in vivo (79). In order to achieve opti￾mal results, it is therefore necessary to carefully balance 
the biomechanical properties of a scaffold with its 
degradation kinetics. A scaffold material has to be 
chosen that degrades and resorbs at a controlled rate, 
giving the TEC sufficient mechanical stability at all times, 
but at the same time allowing new in vivo formed bone 
tissue to substitute for its structure. Figure 3 depicts the 
interdependence of molecular weight loss and mass loss 
of a slow degrading composite scaffold and also shows 
the corresponding stages of tissue regeneration (80).
At the time of implantation the biomechanical pro￾perties of a scaffold should match the structural pro-

perties of the tissue it is implanted into as closely as possi￾ble (124). It should possess sufficient structural integrity for 
the period until the engineered tissue ingrowth has 
replaced the slowly disappearing scaffold matrix with 
regards to mechanical properties. In bone tissue engin￾eering the degradation and resorption kinetics of the 
scaffold have to be controlled in such a way that the 
bioresorbable scaffold retains its physical properties for 
at least 6 months to enable cell and tissue remodelling 
to achieve stable biomechanical conditions and vas￾cularisation at the defect site (97). Apart from host 
anatomy and physiology, the type of tissue that is aimed 
to be engineered also has a profound influence on the 
degree of remodelling: in cancellous bone the remo￾delling takes 3-6 months, while cortical bone will take 
twice as long, approximately 6-12 months, to remodel
(79). Whether the TEC will be part of a load bearing or 
non-load bearing site will also significantly influence the 
needs for mechanical stability of the TEC as mechanical 
loading can directly affect the degradation behaviour 
as well (79). Utilising orthopaedic implants to temporarily 
stabilise the defect area also influences the requirements 
for biomechanical stability of the TEC significantly (18, 
125). It is therefore crucial to meticulously select the 
scaffold material individually for each tissue engineering 
approach to tailor the mechanical properties and de￾gradation kinetics exactly to the purpose of the specific 
TEC (97). Consequently, there is not one “ideal scaffold 
material” for all bone tissue engineering purposes, but 
the choice depends on the size, type and location of 
the bone tissue to be regenerated.
Surface Properties
The surface area of a scaffold represents the space 
where pivotal interactions between biomaterial and 
host tissue take place. The performance of a TEC de￾pends fundamentally on the interaction between biolo￾gical fluids and the surface of the TEC, and it is often 
mediated by proteins absorbed from the biological fluid
(126). The initial events include the orientated adsorption 
of molecules from the surrounding fluid, creating a 
specific interface to which the cells and other factors 
respond to the macrostructure of the scaffold as well as 
the microtopography and chemical properties of the 
surface determine which molecules are adsorbed and 
how cells will attach and align themselves (127). The 
focal attachments made by the cells with their substrate 
then determines cell shape, which in turn transduces 
signals via the cytoskeleton to the nucleus resulting in 
expression of specific proteins which may be structural 
or signal-related and contribute towards the cell pheno￾type. 
Due to technical progress, we are now able to mani￾pulate materials at the atomic, molecular, and supra￾molecular level, and bulk materials and surfaces can be 
designed at a similar dimension to that of the nano￾meter constituent components of bone (2): In natural 
bone, hydroxyapatite plates are approximately between 
25 nm in width and 35 nm in length while collagen type 1 
is a triple helix 300 nm in length, 0.5 nm in width and with 
a periodicity of 67 nm (128). “Nanomaterials” commonly 
refers to materials with basic structural units in the range 
1–100 nm (nanostructured), crystalline solids with grain 
sizes between 1 and 100 nm (nanocrystals), individual 
layers or multilayer surface coatings in the range 1–100 nm 
(nanocoatings), extremely fine powders with an average 
particle size in the range 1–100 nm and fibres with a 
diameter in the range 1–100 nm (nanofibres) (2). The 
close proximity of the scale of these materials to the 
scale of natural bone composites makes the application 
of nanomaterials for bone tissue engineering a very pro￾mising strategy. Surfaces with nanometer topography 
can promote the availability of amino acid and proteins 
for cell adhesion to a great extent, for example, the 
adsorption of fibronectin and vitronectin [two proteins 
known to enhance osteoblast and bone forming cell 
function (129)] can be significantly increased by de￾creasing the grain size on the scaffold/implant surface 
below 100 nm (130). It has also been shown that cal￾cium-mediated cell protein adsorption on nanophase 
material promotes unfolding of these proteins promoting 
bone cell adhesion and function (130). Current literature 
supports the hypothesis that by creating surface topo￾graphies with characteristics that approximate the size 
of proteins, a certain control over protein adsorption 
and interactions will be possible. Since the surface 
characteristics regarding roughness, topography and 
surface chemistry are then transcribed via the protein 
layer into information that is comprehensible for the cells
(127), this will enable the fabrication of surface proper￾ties directly targeted at binding specific cell types. In vitro, 
osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and differentiation 
and calcium deposition is enhanced on nanomaterials 
with grain sizes less than 100 nm (130-131). The adherence 
of osteoblasts has been shown to increase up to three￾fold when the surface is covered with nanophase titan￾ium particles instead of conventional titanium particles
(132). Nano- and microporosiy has also been shown to 
promote osteogenic differentiation (133) and osteo￾genesis (134). The use of nanomaterials to achieve better 
osteointegration of orthopaedic implants and for bone 
tissue engineering approaches has been extensively 
summarised in several recent reviews (2, 135-138) and 
will not be reviewed in its entirety here.

However, it becomes clear that rough scaffold sur￾faces favour attachment, proliferation and differentiation 
of anchorage-dependent bone forming cells (139). 
Osteogenic cells migrate to the scaffold surface through
a fibrin clot initially established immediately after implan￾tation of the TEC from the haematoma caused by the 
surgical procedure (101). The migration causes retraction 
of the temporary fibrin matrix and, if not well secured, 
can lead to detachment of the fibrin from the scaffold 
during wound contraction leading to decreased migra￾tion of the osteogenic cells into the scaffold (140-141).
With regards to surface chemistry, degradation pro￾perties and by-products (relating to pH, osmotic pressure, 
inflammatory reactions etc.) are of importance and 
have been briefly discussed already. In the following 
section, the role of calcium phosphate in the osteo￾inductivity of biomaterials will be summarized as an 
example of how surface chemistry may be manipulated 
to benefit scaffold properties. To date, most synthetic 
biomaterials that have been shown to be osteo￾inductive contained calcium phosphate underlining the 
crucial role of calcium and phosphate in osteoinduction 
properties of biomaterials (142). As summarised above, 
adequate porosity and pore size is crucial for bone tissue 
engineering scaffolds in order to allow sufficient vascula￾risation and enable a supply of body fluids throughout 
the TEC. Together with this nutrient supply, a release of 
calcium and phosphate ions from the biomaterial sur￾face takes places and is believed to be the origin of 
bioactivity of calcium phosphate biomaterials (143-145). 
This process is followed by the precipitation of a biologi￾cal carbonated apatite layer (that contains calcium-, 
phosphate- and other ions such as magnesium as well 
as proteins and other organic compounds) that occurs 
when the concentration of calcium and phosphate ions 
has reached super saturation level in the vicinity of the 
implant (142, 146-147). This bone-like biological car￾bonated apatite layer is thought to be physiological tri￾gger for stem cells to differentiate down the osteogenic 
lineage or could induce the release of growth factors 
that complement this process (142). For biomaterials 
lacking calcium phosphate particles, the roughness of 
the surface is considered to act as a collection of 
nucleation sites for calcium phosphate precipitation 
from the hosts’ body fluids, thereby forming a carbonat￾ed apatite layer.
Comparing calcium phosphate (CaP) coated fibrous 
scaffolds (fibre diameter approx 50 μm) made from me￾dical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) with non-coated 
mPCL-scaffolds, we have shown that CaP-coating is 
beneficial for new bone formation in vitro, enhancing 
alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralisation within 
the scaffolds (148). Interestingly, other research has 
shown that the implantation of highly soluble carbonat￾ed apatite ceramics alone did not result in bone in￾duction in vivo (149), suggesting that a relatively stable 
surface (e.g. through a composite material that con￾tains a less soluble phase) is needed for the facilitation of 
bone formation as discussed above (see “mechanical 
properties and degradation kinetics”). Bone formation 
requires a stable biomaterial interface and therefore, 
too rapid in vivo dissolution of calcium phosphate ma￾terials has been shown to be unfavourable for the 
formation of new bone tissue (150-151). Chai et al. and 
Barradas et al. have recently reviewed the effects of 
calcium phosphate osteogenicity in bone tissue engin￾eering (150, 152).
Further comprehensive reviews on the influence of sur￾face topography and surface chemistry on cell attach￾ment and proliferation for orthopaedic implants and 
bone tissue engineering are available (2, 126, 142, 150, 
153).
Porosity and pore size
Porosity is commonly defined as the percentage of void 
space in a so called cellular solid (the scaffold in bone 
tissue engineering applications) (154). Using solid and 
porous particles of hydroxyapatite for the delivery of the 
growth factor BMP-2, Kuboki et al. showed that pores 
are crucial for bone tissue formation because they allow 
migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and mesen￾chymal cells, as well as vascularisation; no new bone 
formed on solid particles (155). A porous scaffold surface 
also improves mechanical interlocking between the 
implanted TECs and the surrounding natural bone tissue, 
providing greater mechanical stability at this crucial 
interface in tissue engineering (156).
Scaffold porosity and pore size relate to the surface 
area available for the adhesion and growth of cells both 
in vitro as well as in vivo and to the potential for host 
tissue ingrowth, including vasculature, to penetrate into 
the central regions of the scaffold architecture. In 
assessing the significance of porosity several in vivo
studies have been conducted utilising hard scaffold 
materials such as calcium phosphate or titanium with 
defined porous characteristics (157). The majority of 
these studies indicate the importance of pore structure 
in facilitating bone growth. Increase of porosity as well 
as pore size and spacing of pore interconnectivity has 
been found to positively influence bone formation in 
vivo, which is also correlated with scaffold surface area. 
Pore interconnections smaller than 100 μm were found 
to restrict vascular penetration and supplementation of 
a porous structure with macroscopic channels has been

found to further enhance tissue penetration and bone 
formation (97, 158). Interestingly, these results correlate 
well with the diameter of the physiological Haversian 
systems in bone tissue that possess an approximate 
diameter of more than 100 µm. The ability of new capi￾llary blood vessels to grow into the TEC is also related to 
the pore size, thereby directly influencing the rate of 
ingrowth of newly formed bone tissue into the TEC: In 
vivo, larger pore sizes and higher porosity lead to a faster 
rate of neovascularisation, thereby promoting greater 
amounts of new bone formation via direct osteogenesis. 
In contrast, small pores favour hypoxic conditions and 
induce osteochondral formation before osteogenesis 
occurs (92). Pores and pore interconnections should be 
at least 300 microns in diameter to allow sufficient 
vascularisation. Besides the actual macroporosity (pore 
size >50 µm) of the scaffold microporosity (pore size <
10 µm) and pore wall roughness also have a large im￾pact on osteogenic response: Microporosity results in lar￾ger surface areas contributing to higher bone-inducing 
protein adsorption and to ion exchange and bone-like 
apatite formation by dissolution and re-precipitation
(139, 157). As outlined above, sub-micron and nanometre 
surface roughness favours attachment, proliferation and 
differentiation of anchorage-dependent bone forming 
cells (139).
Although increased porosity and higher pore size facili￾tate bone ingrowth, it also compromises the structural 
integrity of the scaffold, and if the porosity becomes too 
high it may adversely affect the mechanical properties 
of the scaffold at the same time (79). In addition, the 
rate of degradation is influenced by the porosity and 
pore size (for biodegradable scaffolds). A higher pore 
surface area enhances interaction of the scaffold 
materials with host tissue and can thereby accelerate 
degradation by macrophages via oxidation and/or 
hydrolysis (157). Therefore, scaffolds fabricated from 
biomaterials with a high degradation rate should not 
have high porosities (>90%) in order to avoid compro￾mise to the mechanical and structural integrity before 
adequate substitution by newly formed bone tissue. 
Scaffolds made from slowly degrading biomaterials with 
robust mechanical properties can, in contrast, be highly 
porous (157). Table 4 illustrates mechanical properties 
and degradation kinetics in relation to the porosity for 
many commonly used composite scaffolds. This illustrates

that there are a number of advantages and disadvan￾tages associated with any changes made to the poro￾sity or pore size of scaffolds. It is inevitable to find a 
balance between these pros and cons in order to tailor 
the scaffold properties ideally to the demands of the 
tissue engineering approach used. For comprehensive 
reviews on role of porosity and pore size in tissue engin￾eering scaffolds, the reader is referred to two recently 
published reviews (157, 159).
It becomes clear that a multitude of factors have to 
be taken into account when designing and fabricating 
scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. However, it is 
beyond the scope of this review to present all of them in 
detail and a number of comprehensive reviews have 
been published recently on this topic (2, 5, 79, 97, 101, 
160-161).
Additive manufacturing and Computer Aided 
Design – Game changers in the fabrication of 
three-dimensional scaffolds
The three-dimensional design characteristics in com￾bination with the material properties of a scaffold are 
crucial for bone tissue engineering purposes. Not only 
does the scaffold structure need to be controlled on a 
macroscopic level (to achieve sufficient interposition of 
the scaffold into the defect site), but also on a micro￾scopic level (to optimise tissue engineering properties 
with regards to osteoinduction, osteoconduction, osteo￾genesis and vascularisation as well as mechanical stabi￾lity) and even down to nanostructural configuration (to 
optimise protein adsorption, cell adhesion, differentiation 
and proliferation related to desired tissue engineering 
characteristics of the TEC). It is therefore necessary to 
exert strict control over the scaffold properties during the 
fabrication process. Conventional techniques for scaffold 
fabrication include solvent casting and particulate 
leaching, gas foaming, fibre meshes and fibre bonding, 
phase separation, melt molding, emulsion freeze drying, 
solution casting and freeze drying (162). All of these 
techniques are subtractive in nature, meaning that parts 
of the fabricated scaffold are removed from the 
construct after the initial fabrication process in order to 
generate the desired three-dimensional characteristics. 
Hence a number of limitations exist regarding these 
fabrication methods: conventional methods do not 
allow a precise control over pore size, pore geometry, 
pore interconnectivity or spatial distribution of pores and 
interconnecting channels of the scaffolds fabricated (92, 
163-164). In addition, many of these techniques require 
the application of organic solvents and their residues 
can impose severe adverse effects on cells due to their 
potentially toxic and/or carcinogenic nature, reducing 
the biocompatibility of the scaffold significantly (165).
The introduction of additive manufacturing (AM) tech￾niques into the field of bone tissue engineering has 
helped to overcome many of these restrictions (92, 162, 
166). In AM three-dimensional objects are created in a 
computer-controlled layer-by-layer fabrication process. 
In contrast to subtractive conventional methods of 
scaffold fabrication, this technique is additive in nature 
and does not involve removal of materials after the 
initial fabrication step. These techniques have also been 
named “rapid prototyping” or “solid free form fabri￾cation” in the past, but in order to clearly distinguish 
them from conventional methods the latest ASTM 
standard now summarises all of these techniques under 
the term “Additive Manufacturing” (167). The basis for 
each AM process is the design of a three-dimensional 
digital or in silico model of the scaffold to be produced. 
This computer model can either be created from 
scratch using “computer aided design” (CAD) methods 
or can be generated using data from a 3D-scan of 
existing three-dimensional structures (such as the human 
skeleton) (168). The digital model is then converted into 
an STL-file that expresses the three-dimensional structure 
as the summary of multiple horizontal two-dimensional 
planes. Using this STL-file an AM-machine then creates 
the three-dimensional scaffold structure in a layer-by￾layer fabrication method in which each layer is tightly 
connected to the previous layer to create a solid object. 
A number of different AM techniques are currently appli￾ed using thermal, chemical, mechanical and/or optical 
processes to create the solid three-dimensional object
(166). These methods include laser-based methods such 
as Stereolithography (STL) and Selective Laser Sintering 
(SLS), printing-based applications (e.g. 3D-Printing, Wax￾Printing) and Nozzle-based systems like Melt Extrusion/
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Bioplotting. The 
multitude of AM techniques and their specifications 
were reviewed by several authors lately (162, 166, 169-
170).
AM techniques have been used since the 1980s in the 
telecommunication industry, in jewelry making and 
production of automobiles (171). From the 1990s onwards, 
AM was gradually introduced to the medical field as 
well (172): AM was initially used to fabricate three￾dimensional models of bone pathologies in orthopaedic 
maxillofacial neurosurgical applications to plan surgical 
procedures and for haptic assessment during the sur￾gery itself (173-174). With recent technical advances AM 
is nowadays applied to make custom-made implants 
and surgical tools (175) and to fabricate highly detailed, 
custom-made three-dimensional models for the indivi-

dual patient (using data from CT, MRI, SPECT etc.) to 
plan surgical approaches, specifically locate osteotomy 
sites, choose the correct implant and to predict func￾tional and cosmetic outcomes of surgeries (176-177). 
Thereby the operating time as well as the risk of compli￾cations has been reduced significantly.
The application of AM in bone tissue engineering 
represents a highly significant innovation that has dras￾ticcally changes the way scaffolds are being fabricated; 
AM has more or less become the new gold standard for 
scaffold manufacturing (92). The advantages of rapid 
prototyping processes include (but are not limited to) 
increased speed, customisation and efficiency. AM tech￾nologies have relatively few process steps and involve 
little manual interaction, therefore, three-dimensional 
parts can be manufactured in hours and days instead of 
weeks and months. The direct nature of AM allows the 
economical production of customized tissue engineer￾ing scaffolds. The products can be tailored to match the 
patient’s needs and still sustain economic viability as 
compared to traditional techniques which must manu￾facture great numbers of devices. The conventional 
scaffold fabrication methods commonly limit the ability 
to form complex geometries and internal features. AM 
methods reduce the design constraints and enable the 
fabrication of desired delicate features both inside and 
outside the scaffold. Using STL, the AM technique with 
the highest precision, for example objects at a scale of 
20 µm can be fabricated (178). A two-photon STL-tech￾nique to initiate the polymerisation can be used to pro￾duce structures even at micrometer and sub-micrometer
levels (179).
AM methods allow for variation of composition of two 
or more materials across the surface, interface, or bulk of 
the scaffold during the manufacturing. Thereby, posi￾tional variations in physicochemical properties and 
surface characteristics can be created and utilized to 
promote locally specific tissue engineering signals. 
Several AM techniques operate without the use of toxic 
organic solvents. This is a significant benefit, since 
incomplete removal of solvents may lead to harmful 
residues that can affect adherence of cells, activity of 
incorporated biological agents or surrounding tissues as 
already described. AM allows the control of scaffold 
porosity leading to the applications that may have 
areas of greater or lesser structural integrity and areas of 
encouraged blood flow due to increased porosity. 
Fabricating devices and/or implants with differences in 
spatial distribution of porosities, pore sizes, mechanical 
and chemical properties can mimic the complex com￾position and architecture of natural bone tissue and 
thereby optimise bone tissue engineering techniques. In 
addition, scaffolds with gradients in porosity and pore 
sizes can be functionalised to allow vascularisation and 
direct osteogenesis in one area of the scaffold, while 
promoting osteochondral ossification in the other, which 
is an appealing approach to reproduce multiple tissues 
and tissue interfaces within one and the same biomaterial 
scaffold (157). Table 5 summarises the advantages of 
scaffolds designed and fabricated by AM techniques.

degradable polymer material (e.g. aliphatic polyesters) be affected in a controlled fashion as the polymer 
by-products are neutralized by ceramic components

structure

differing configurations can be altered so as to increase or decrease the mechanical properties of the 
scaffold

Translating bone tissue engineering strategies 
from bench to bedside
Musculoskeletal conditions are highly prevalent and 
cause a large amount of pain, illness and disability to 
patients. These conditions are the second most common 
reason for consulting a general practitioner, accounting 
for almost 25% of the total cost of illness and up to 15% of 
primary care (180). In addition, the impact of musculo￾skeletal conditions is predicted to grow with the increas￾ing incidence of lifestyle-related obesity, reduced physi￾cal fitness and increased road traffic accidents (180). 
The impact of bone trauma is significant-the consequen￾ces of failing to restore full function to an injured limb are 
dramatically demonstrated by the statistic that only 28% 
of patients suffering from severe open fractures of the 
tibia are able to resume full function and hence return to 
previous employment (180). Along with trauma, tumour 
resection is another major cause of large bone defects. 
Cancer is a major public health challenge, with one in 
four deaths in the United States currently due to this 
disease. Recent statistics indicate that 1 638 910 new 
cancer cases and 577 190 deaths from cancer are pro￾jected to occur in the United States in 2012 (181). As 
outlined above, the number of procedures requiring 
bone implant material is increasing, and will continue to 
do so in our aging population and with deteriorating 
physical activity levels (57). The current bone grafting 
market already is estimated to be in excess of $2.5 billion 
each year and is expected to increase by 7-8% per year
(45). With the introduction of tissue engineering the hopes 
and expectations were extremely high to be able to 
substitute natural organs with similar (or even better) 
tissue engineered replacement organs. However, at the 
time it was stated that “few areas of technology will 
require more interdisciplinary research than tissue engin￾eering” (75) and this assessment holds true today.
In the years to follow, numerous private and public 
institutes conducted scientific research and clinical trans￾lation efforts related to tissue engineering. At the begin￾ning of 2001, tissue engineering research and develop￾ment was being pursued by 3 300 scientists and support 
staff in more than 70 start-up companies or business units 
with a combined annual expenditure of over $600 million 
USD (182). The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
accounting for the largest cumulative US federal re￾search expenditures, has increased the funding in tissue 
engineering from 2.36 billion USD in the fiscal year 2003 
to more than 614 billion USD for the fiscal year 2006 (183). 
Between 2000 and 2008 the number of papers published 
on tissue engineering and scaffolds per year increased 
by more than 400% and more than 900%, respectively
(184). But despite the increasing research expenditure 
and the magnitude of discoveries and innovations in 
bone tissue engineering since its introduction more than 
three decades ago, the translation of these novel tech￾niques into routine clinical applications on a large scale 
has still not taken place. As Scott J. Hollister has pointed 
out, there is, on the one hand, a stark contrast between 
the amount of tissue engineering research expenditures 
over the last 20 years and the resulting numbers of pro￾ducts and sales figures. On the other hand, there is also 
a significant discrepancy between the complexities of 
intended tissue engineering therapies compared to the 
actual therapies that have reached clinical applications
(184). This evident gap between research and clinical 
application/commercialisation is commonly termed the 
“Valley of Death” due to the large number of ventures 
that “die” between scientific technology development 
and actual commercialization due to lack of funds 
(Figure 4) (184). The Valley of Death is particularly large 
for tissue engineering approaches because this field of 
research often utilises immensely cost intensive high-tech
biotechnologies for technological development eating 
up large parts of the funding available, but then addi￾tionally faces the challenges of funding large scale pre￾clinical studies and clinical studies to gain approval by 
regulatory bodies, demonstrate product safety and gain 
clinical acceptance (184-186).
Bridging the gap between tissue engineering research 
and clinical applications
To bridge the gap between the bench and bedside, the 
scaffold is required to perform as a developmentally 
conducive extracellular niche, at a clinically relevant 
scale and in concordance with strict clinical (economic 
and manufacturing) prerequisites (Figure 5) (187). In this 
context the scaffold facilitates for smaller and medium 
sized defects the entrapment of the hematoma and 
prevents it’s “too early” contraction (188). For large and 
high-load bearing defects the scaffold can also deliver 
cells and/or growth factors to the site of damage and 
provides an appropriate template for new tissue forma￾tion. The scaffold should thus constitute a dynamically 
long-lasting yet degradable three-dimensional architec￾ture, preferably serving as a functional tissue substitute 
which, over time, can be replaced by cell-derived tissue 
function. Designing and manufacturing processes are 
believed to be the gatekeepers to translate tissue engin￾eering research into clinical tissue engineering applica￾tions and concentration on the development of these 
entities will enable scaffolds to bridge the gap between
research and clinical practice (184). One of the greatest 
difficulties in bridging the Valley of Death is to develop

good manufacturing processes and scalable designs 
and to apply these in preclinical studies; for a descrip￾tion of the rationale and road map of how our multidisci￾plinary research team has addressed this first step to 
translate orthopaedic bone engineering from bench to 
bedside see below and refer to our recent publication
(185). In order to take bone tissue engineering approa￾ches from bench to bedside, it also imperative to meti￾culously assess the clinical demands for specific scaffold 
characteristics to achieve a broad and optimised range 
of clinical applications for the specific tissue engineering 
approach. A sophisticated bone tissue engineering tech￾nology will not necessarily have multiple clinical applica￾tions just because of its level of complexity, and defining 
specific clinical target applications remains one of the 
most underestimated challenges in the bridging the 
Valley of Death (184). There is often a great level of dis￾crepancy between the clinical demands on a tissue 
engineering technique and the scientific realisation of 
such technique, hampering the clinical translation. Thus 
a scaffold that is realistically targeted at bridging the 
Valley of Death should (187): (i) meet FDA approval (for 
further details on this topics see reviews by Scott J. Hollis￾ter 2011 and 2009) (184, 189); (ii) allow for cost effective 
manufacturing processes; (iii) be sterilisable by industrial 
techniques; (iv) enable easy handling without extensive 
preparatory procedures in the operation theatre; (v) 
preferably, be radiographically distinguishable from 
newly formed tissue; and (vi) allow minimally invasive 
implantation (190-191).
Rationale for translating bone tissue engineering 
strategies into clinical applications
In targeting the translation of a (bone) tissue engineer￾ing approach from bench to bedside, there is a distinct 
hierarchy and sequence of the type of studies that need 
to be undertaken to promote the translation process
(192): Having identified clinical needs and based on fun￾Figure 4 For tissue engineering, the Valley of Death is the gap and associated funding difficulties of taking tissue engineering technologies to 
tissue-engineered products. The Valley exists due to the need of obtaining funding to develop scalable/GMP design and manufacturing processes, the 
need for pre-clinical studies proving therapies in large animal models, and finally, the need to progress to clinical trials. Reproduced with permission

criteria the biomimetic scaffold plays a critical role bridging the gap between the developmental context of stem cell mediated tissue formation and

damental discoveries regarding biological mechanisms, 
a novel tissue engineering approach is designed and 
first studies are undertaken to characterise mechanical 
and chemical properties of the TEC to be used. The next 
step involves feasibility and bioactivity testing and 
should be carried out in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays 
using cell culture preparations are used to characterise 
the effects of materials on isolated cell function and for 
screening large numbers of compounds for biological 
activity, toxicity and immunogenicity (193-194). However, 
due to their nature using isolated cells, in vitro models 
are unavoidably limited in their capacity to reflect com￾plex in vivo environments that the TEC will be exposed to 
and are therefore inadequate to predict in vivo or 
clinical performances. Therefore, in vivo models (that is 
animal models) are required in order to overcome the 
limitations of in vitro models to provide a reproducible 
approximation of the real life situation. In vivo feasibility 
testing is almost exclusively done in small animals, mainly 
in rodents and rabbits (192, 195-197). The advantages of 
small animal models include relatively easy standardisa￾tion of experimental conditions, fast bone turnover rates 
(=shorter periods of observation), similar lamellar bone 
architecture and similar cancellous bone thinning and 
fragility, similar remodelling rates and sites, common 
availability and relatively low costs for housing and main￾tenance. Disadvantages of rodent and rabbit models 
include different skeletal loading patterns, open epiphy￾ses at various growth plates up to the age of 12-14 
months (or for lifetime in rats), minimal intra-cortical remo￾delling, the lack of Harversian canal systems, a smaller 
proportion of cancellous bone to total bone mass and 
their relatively small size for testing of implants (196). 
Whilst a large number of studies in rodents and rabbits 
have established proof of concept for bone tissue engin￾eering strategies, scaling up to larger, more clinically

relevant animal models has presented new challenges. 
Quoting Thomas A. Einhorn, when conducting animal 
studies, one has to keep in mind that “in general, the 
best model system is the one which most closely mimics 
the clinical situation for which this technology is being 
developed, will not heal spontaneously unless the tech￾nology is used, and will not heal when another tech￾nology is used if that technology is less advanced than 
the one being tested” (198). The most effective animal 
models will therefore 1) provide close resemblance of 
the clinical and biological environment and material 
properties, 2) encompass highly standardised measure￾ment methods providing objective parameters (qualita￾tive and quantitative) to investigate the newly formed 
bone tissue and 3) are able to detect and predict signifi￾cant differences between the bone tissue engineering 
methods investigated (192). For clinical modelling and 
efficacy prediction of the tissue engineering strategy to 
be translated into clinical application, up-scaling to 
large animal models is therefore inevitable. Thereby, the 
tissue engineering therapy can be delivered in the same 
(or similar) way in which it will be delivered in clinical 
settings utilising surgical techniques that match (or 
closely resemble) clinical methods at the site that 
matches the setting in which it will be used later as 
closely as possible (192). The advantage of large animal 
models (using nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, sheep, 
goats, pigs) is the closer resemblance of microarchitec￾ture, bone physiology and biomechanical properties in 
humans. They encompass a well-developed Haversian 
and trabecular bone remodelling, have greater skeletal 
surface to volume areas, show similar skeletal disuse 
atrophy, enable the use of implants and techniques 
similar to the ones used in humans and show highly 
localised bone fragility associated with stress shielding by 
implants. However, the use of large animal models has 
disadvantages as well, including the high cost and 
maintenance expenses, extensive housing and space 
requirements, relatively long life spans and lower bone 
turnover rates (making longer study periods necessary), 
difficulties in standardisation to generate large, homo￾genous samples for statistical testing as well as various 
ethical concerns depending on the species used (e.g. 
primates) (196). But despite several disadvantages, it is 
inevitable to perform the final pre-clinical in large ani￾mals, as realistically as possible, with relevant loading 
conditions and with similar surgical techniques as used in 
the final procedure in humans (197). Large animal models 
provide mass and volume challenges for scaffold-based 
tissue engineering and require surgical fixation techniques 
that cannot be tested either in vitro or in small animal 
models (184). In general, preclinical translation testing is 
performed in large skeletally mature animals, the species 
most utilised are dog, sheep, goat and pig (192, 199). If 
sufficient preclinical evidence for the efficacy and safe￾ty of the new bone tissue engineering system has been 
generated utilising large animal models, clinical trials 
care undertaken to prove clinical significance and safe￾ty, ultimately leading to the translation of the technology 
into routine clinical practice.
Taking composite scaffold based bone tissue 
engineering from bench to bedside
In accordance with the above outline rationale for 
translating bone tissue engineering research into clinical 
applications, during the last decade our interdisciplinary 
research team has focussed on the bench to bedside 
translation of a bone tissue engineering concept based 
on slowly biodegradable composite scaffolds made 
from medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) and cal￾cium phosphates [hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium 
phosphate (TCP)] (80, 200). Detailed descriptions of the 
scaffold fabrication protocol can be found in our recent 
publications (102, 109, 200-202).
The scaffolds have been shown in vitro to support cell 
attachment, migration and proliferation; degradation 
behaviour and tissue in-growth has also been exten￾sively studied (203-206). We subsequently took the next 
step towards clinical translation by performing small 
animal studies using rat, mice and rabbit models (207-
209). As reviewed in detail in Reference (200), we were 
able to demonstrate the in vivo capability of our com￾posite scaffolds in combination with growth factors or 
cells to promote bone regeneration within ectopic sites 
or critical sized cranial defects in the small animal models. 
Studies in large animal models that closely resemble the 
clinical characteristics of human disease, with respect to 
defect size and mechanical loading, then became 
essential to advance the translation of this technology 
into the most difficult and challenging clinical applica￾tions in orthopaedic tumour and trauma surgery. The 
choice of a suitable large animal model depends on the 
ultimate clinical application, and consequently there is 
no such thing as “one gold standard animal model”. 
Over the last years, our research team has investigated 
the application of our composite scaffolds in several
preclinical large animal models addressing different 
clinical applications: 
Load-bearing, critical-sized ovine tibial defect model
Well-characterised, reproducible and clinically relevant 
animal models are essential to generate proof-of￾principle pre-clinical data necessary to advance novel 
therapeutic strategies into clinical trial and practical

application. Our research group at the Queensland 
University of Technology (QUT; Brisbane, Australia) has 
spent the last 5 years developing a world-leading defect 
model to study pre-clinically different treatment options 
for cases of large volume segmental bone loss (159, 210). 
We have successfully established this 3 cm critical-sized 
defect model in sheep tibiae to study the mPCL-TCP 
scaffold in combination with cells or growth factors in￾cluding bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (211-212). 
This model has not only generated a series of highly 
cited publications (211-215), but also has attracted large 
interest in the orthopaedic industry to be used as a 
preclinical test bed for their bone graft products under 
development. The model enables control of experimen￾tal conditions to allow for direct comparison of products 
against a library of benchmarks and gold standards we 
have developed over the last 5 years (we have per￾formed more than 200 operations using this model to￾date). Our preclinical tibial defect model developed at 
QUT is one of the only available models internationally, 
which is suitable from both reproducibility and cost point 
of view for the evaluation of large segmental defect 
repair technologies in statistically powered study designs. 
We have chosen this critical sized segmental defect 
model of the tibia for our large animal model because 
tibial fractures represent the most common long bone 
fractures in humans and are often associated with sig￾nificant loss of bone substance (216-217). Also, tibial 
fractures result in high rates of non-unions or pseud￾arthroses (216, 218). From an orthopaedic surgeons point 
of view it can be argued that amongst all bone defects 
seen in the clinical practice, segmental defects of the 
tibia are often the most challenging graft sites. This owes 
to the grafts being required to bear loads close to 
physiological levels very soon after implantation, this is 
despite internal fixation, which often provides the 
necessary early stability, but also suffers from the poor 
soft tissue coverage (vascularisation issue) of the tibia 
compared to the femur. Hence, in a bone engineering 
strategy for the treatment of segmental tibial defects, 
the scaffold must bear (or share) substantial loads im￾mediately after implantation. The scaffold’s mechanical 
properties (strength, modulus, toughness, and ductility) 
are determined both by the material properties of the 
bulk material and by its structure (macrostructure, micro￾structure, and nanostructure). Matching the mechanical 
properties of a scaffold to the tibial graft environment is 
critically important so that progression of tissue healing is 
not limited by mechanical failure of the scaffold prior to 
successful tissue regeneration. Similarly, because me￾chanical signals are important mediators of the differen￾tiation of cell progenitors, a scaffold must create an 
appropriate stress environment throughout the site 
where new tissue is desired. Hence, one of the greatest 
challenges in scaffold design for load bearing tibial 
defects is the control of the mechanical properties of 
the scaffold over time. By trialing our bone tissue engin￾eering strategies in a tibial defect model, we will there￾fore address a highly relevant clinical problem and are 
creating valuable pre-clinical evidence for the trans￾lation from bench to bedside. With the 3 cm critical de￾fect being regenerated successfully by applying our 
mPCL-TCP scaffold in combination with BMP (102), we 
are now investigating bone regeneration potentials in 
even larger sized tibial defects (Figure 6).
Minimally-invasive ovine thoracic spine fusion model
Spinal fusion has been investigated in animal models for 
one hundred years now and a lot of the knowledge we 
have today on how spinal fusion progresses was gained 
through animal models (219-220). With regards to the 
above pictured rationale for translating bone tissue 
engineering approaches to clinical practice, it is of 
importance to note that the physical size of the sheep 
spine is adequate to allow spinal surgery to be carried 
out using the same implants and surgical approaches 
that are used in humans as well. Also, sheep spines allow 
for an evaluation of the success of the study using fusion 
assessments commonly used in clinical practice. When 
considering spinal fusion in large animal models, it is 
apparent that due to the biomechanical properties of 
the spine a biped primate animal model [such as in 
(221)] should ideally preferred over a quadruped large 
animal model [for example ovine (222) or porcine (223)]. 
But given the expenses and limited availability of pri￾mate testing as well as ethical concerns due to the close 
phylogenical relation, it is more feasible to trial large 
numbers of scaffold variations in the most appropriate 
quadruped large animal models and then evaluate the 
best performing scaffold in a primate model, if possible
(184).
We have outlined above that defining specific clinical 
target applications is a critical prerequisite for successful 
bone tissue engineering research that is meant to be 
translated into clinical practice. In accordance with this 
we have selected the thoracic spine for our animal 
model because we have identified idiopathic scoliosis 
as clinically highly relevant thoracic spine pathology. 
Idiopathic scoliosis is a complex three-dimensional de￾formity affecting 2-3% of the general population (224). 
Scoliotic spine deformities include progressive coronal 
curvature, hypokyphosis or lordosis in the thoracic spine 
and vertebral rotation in the axial plane with posterior 
elements turned rotated toward the curve concavity.

Scoliotically deformed vertebral columns are prone to 
accelerated intervertebral disc degeneration, initiating 
more severe morphological changes of the affected 
vertebral joints and leading to chronic local, pseudo￾radicular, and radicular back pain (225). One of the 
critical aspects in surgical scoliosis deformity correction is 
bony fusion to achieve long-term stability (226). Auto￾logous bone grafting is still the gold standard to achieve 
spinal fusion and superior to other bone grafts for spinal 
fusion (227-229). Nonetheless, the use of autologous 
bone grafting material has significant risks as outlined in 
detail above. A number of animal models for the use of 
tissue-engineered bone constructs in spinal fusion exists
(230) and the use of bone morphogenetic proteins for 
spinal fusion has been studied extensively (219, 222, 
231-232). However, to the best of our knowledge, our 
ovine thoracic spine fusion model is the first existing 
preclinical large animal model on thoracic interverte￾bral fusion allowing the assessment of tissue-engineering 
constructs such as biodegradable mPCL-CaP scaffolds 
and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein￾2 (rhBMP2) as a bone graft substitute to promote bony 
fusion (Figure 7) (233). We have been able to show that 
radiological and histological results at 6-months post 
surgery indicated had comparable grades of fusion and 
evidenced new bone formation for the mPCL-CaP sca￾ffolds plus rhBMP-2 and autograft groups. The scaffold 
alone group, however, had lower grades of fusion in 
comparison to the other two groups. Our results demons￾trate the ability of this large animal model to trial various 
tissue engineering constructs against the current gold 
standard autograft treatment for spinal fusion in the same
animal. In the future, we will be able to compare spinal 
fusion tissue engineering constructs in order to create 
statistically significant evidence for clinical translation of 
such techniques.

using a 12 hole DCP (Synthes) (F). Afterwards 6cm mPCL-TCP scaffold loaded with PRP and rhBMP-7 is press fitted into the defect site to bridge the 
defect (G-H) and the plate is fixed in its final position. Xray analysis at 3 months after implantation (I) shows complete bridging of the defect site with 
newly formed radio-opaque mineralised tissue (in order to provide sufficient mechanical support, the scaffold is not fully degraded yet and scaffold 
struts appear as void inside the newly formed bone tissue).

Current clinical applications of the composite scaffolds 
and future outlook
The interdisciplinary research group has evaluated and 
patented the parameters necessary to process medical 
grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) and mPCL composite 
scaffolds (containing hydroxyapatite or tricalciumphos￾phate) by fused deposition modeling (97). These “first 
generation scaffolds” have undergone more than 5 
years of studies in clinical settings and have gained 
Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approval in 2006 and 
have also been successfully commercialised (www.
osteoporeinternational.com). The scaffolds have been 
used highly successfully as burr whole plugs for cranio￾plasty (234) and until today more than 200 patients have 
received burr whole plugs, scaffolds for orbital floor re￾construction and other cranioplasties (Figure 8) (92). With 
their extensive, multidisciplinary approach the research 
team has achieved one of the rare examples of a highly 
successful bone tissue engineering approach bridging 
the gap between scientific research and clinical prac￾tice leading to significant innovations in clinical routines.
As shown above, “second generation scaffolds” pro￾duced by FDM and based on composite materials have 
already been broadly studied in vitro plus in vivo in small 
animal models and are currently under preclinical 
evaluation in large animal studies conducted by our re￾search group. Available data so far clearly supports the 
view that further translation into clinical use will take 
place and that a broad spectrum of targeted clinical 
applications will exist for these novel techniques. 
Our results are consistent with the results of other mem￾bers of the (bone) tissue engineering community all 
around the world, clearly showing the significance of 
innovations in the field of tissue engineering. In 2006 Chris 
Mason proposed two distinctly different periods of the 
regenerative medicine industry, namely, Regenerative 
Medicine 1.0 spanning 1985–2002, and Regenerative 
Medicine 2.0 commencing in approximately 2006 (1).

We herein propose that Regenerative Medicine 3.0 has 
commenced. We foresee that the complexity and great 
variety of large bone defects require an individualized, 
patient-specific approach with regards to surgical re￾construction in general and implant/tissue engineering 
selection in specific. We advocate that bone tissue 
engineering and bioengineering technology platforms, 
such as additive manufacturing approaches can be 
used even more substantially in bone grafting proce￾dures to advance clinical approaches in general and 
for the benefit of individual patient in particular.
The tremendous advantage of scaffolds made by 
Additive Manufacturing techniques such as Fused De￾position Modeling (FDM) is the distinct control over the 
macroscopic and microscopic shape of the scaffold 
and thereby control over the shape of the entire TEC in 
total. Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of 
highly structured scaffolds to optimise properties highly 
relevant in bone tissue engineering (osteoconductivity, 
osteoinductivity, osteogenicity, vascularisation, mechani￾cal and chemical properties) on a micro- and nanometre 
scale. Using high-resolution medical images of bone 
pathologies (acquired via CT, µCT, MRI, ultrasound, 3D 
digital photogrammy and other techniques) (168), we 
are not only be able to fabricate patient-specific instru￾mentation (235-237), patient-specific conventional im￾plants (238-242) or allografts (243), but also to realise 
custom-made tissue engineering constructs (TEC) tai￾lored specifically to the needs of each individual patient
and the desired clinical application (168, 174, 244). We 
therefore predict that the commencing area of Regen￾erative Medicine 3.0 will hold a significant leap forward
in terms of Personalised Medicine.
We have already proven the clinical application of
Figure 8 Clinical case showing the craniofacial scaffold applications for orbital floor fractures. Moldable scaffolds (A–D) are used and mechanical 
stability, early vascularisation, osteoconductivity and ease of handling have been well balanced in the design of mPCL scaffold sheets in order to 
properly meet the clinician's needs. The clinical follow up 2.5 years postsurgery (lower CT image) of a patient receiving a mPCL scaffold (defect site 
shown in upper CT image) for the reconstruction of a orbital floor fracture defect showed complete bone regeneration of the defect site (arrow).

this concept by fabricating a custom-made bioactive 
mPCL-TCP implant via CAD/FDM that was used clinically 
to successfully reconstruct a complex cranial defect
(245). We have also recently provided a rationale for the 
use of CAD/FDM and mPCL-TCP scaffolds in contributing 
to clinical therapy concepts after resection of musculo￾skeletal sarcoma (Figures 9 and 10) (246). Although it has 
to be mentioned that our approaches presented in this 
review are at different stages of clinical translation, their 
entity clearly represents a promising and highly significant 
21 century approach in taking bone tissue engineering 
strategies from bench to bedside and into the era of 
Regenerative Medicine 3.0.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the field of bone tissue engineering has 
significantly changed the millennia old quest by humans
Figure 9 Clinical case of a 52 year old man with a malignant bone tumour above his left hip. (A) X ray and computed tomogram showing mixed lytic 
sclerotic lesion above the left acetabulum, Technitium-MDP bone scan demonstrating focal area of increased tracer uptake within the tumour. (B) 
Tumour resection leaving a large pelvic defect (white arrows), f=femoral head. (C) Resected specimen including upper part of acetabulum (Clinical 
images: P.F.C.). The surgical resection creates a large bone defect in the pelvis that necessitates the use of autograft/allograft bone material and/or 
orthopaedic implants to reconstitute the pelvic anatomy. A novel approach (D-G) could be the use of custom made porous bone tissue engineering 
scaffolds fabricated via Computer Aided Design (CAD) to regenerate such defects: Data obtained from high-resolution CT can be used to create a 3D 
computer-aided designed (CAD) model of the patient's pelvis by additive manufacturing (D). This model can be used by the orthopaedic surgeon to 
indicate osteotomy planes to achieve tumour free margins, after which, after which the CAD model is virtually resected (E). A custom made scaffold 
to fit the defined defect is then created by mirroring the healthy side of the pelvis, adjusting the size of the scaffold accordingly and fabricating the 
scaffold from the virtual model using AM techniques (F). Flanges, intramedullary pegs and other details can be added to the porous scaffold structure 
to facilitate surgical fixation and to enhance its primary stability after implantation (G). Images D-G reproduced with permission from (246), © The

to optimise the treatment of bone defects and to iden￾tify suitable bone substitute materials. We have review￾ed the historic development, current clinical therapy 
standards and their limitations as well as currently availa￾ble bone substitute materials. We have also outlined 
current knowledge on scaffold properties required for
Figure 10 The vascularised fibula transfer is one of the most commonly used techniques for reconstruction of large tibial defects in orthopaedic 
oncology. The figure shows clinical case from a 16 year old girl with a malignant tumour of the mid-shaft of tibia. A: Xray showing destructive lesion. 
B: Segmental resection of tumour. C: Defect created by the removal of tumour. D: Example of reconstruction using vascularised fibular within 
allograft bone (Cappanna procedure). E: Reconstruction in-situ using vascularised fibular and allograft. F: postoperative X-ray images. G: 3D 
computed tomogram of reconstruction showing fibula enclosed by allograft bone material (Clinical case: P.F.C.). A novel biological approach to avoid 
the use of allograft material could be the combination of a vascularised fibula transfer with a custom made tissue engingeering construct as shown in 
H: After resection of the malignant tumour (1), a customized tubular scaffold is placed around the vascularised fibula autograft to fill the defect (2-3). 
Primary stability and even load distribution is achieved by using an internal fixation device (4). Secondary stability is achieved by osseointegration of 
both the fibula and the porous tissue engineering scaffold. Over time, the scaffold is slowly replaced by ingrowing tissue engineered bone and the 
defect is completely bridged and regenerated (5). H partly reproduced with permission from (246), © The Authors.

bone tissue engineering and the potential clinical appli￾cations as well as the difficulties in bridging the gap 
between research and clinical practice. Although the 
clinical translation of these approaches has not taken 
place on a large scale yet, bone tissue engineering 
clearly holds the potential to overcome historic limita￾tions and disadvantages associated with the use of the 
current gold-standard autologous bone graft. Optimi￾zing combinations of cells, scaffolds, and locally and 
systemically active stimuli will remain a complex process 
characterized by a highly interdependent set of variables 
with a large range of possible variations. Consequently, 
these developments must also be nurtured and moni￾tored by a combination of clinical experience, know￾ledge of basic biological principles, medical necessity, 
and commercial practicality. The responsibility for rational 
development is shared by the entire orthopaedic 
community (developers, vendors, and physicians). The 
need for objective and systematic assessment and 
reporting is made particularly urgent by the recent rapid 
addition of many new options for clinical use. By apply￾ing a complex interplay of 21st century technologies 
from various disciplines of scientific research, the gap 
between bone tissue engineering research and the 
translation into clinically available bone tissue engineer￾ing applications can successfully be bridged.
