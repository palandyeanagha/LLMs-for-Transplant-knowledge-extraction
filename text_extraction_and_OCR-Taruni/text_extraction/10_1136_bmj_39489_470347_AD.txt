ANALYSIS
advantages and disadvantages but also by their confi￾dence in these estimates. The cartoon depicting the 
weather forecaster’s uncertainty captures the difference 
between an assessment of the likelihood of an outcome 
and the confidence in that assessment (figure). The use￾fulness of an estimate of the magnitude of intervention 
effects depends on our confidence in that estimate.
Expert clinicians and organisations offering recom￾mendations to the clinical community have often erred 
as a result of not taking sufficient account of the quality 
of evidence.2
 For a decade, organisations recommended 
that clinicians encourage postmenopausal women to use 
hormone replacement therapy.3
 Many primary care phy￾sicians dutifully applied this advice in their practices.
A belief that such therapy substantially decreased 
women’s cardiovascular risk drove this recommenda￾tion. Had a rigorous system of rating the quality of evi￾dence been applied at the time, it would have shown 
that because the data came from observational studies 
with inconsistent results, the evidence for a reduction in 
cardiovascular risk was of very low quality.4 Recognition 
of the limitations of the evidence would have tempered
the recommendations. Ultimately, randomised 
controlled trials have shown that hormone replacement 
therapy fails to reduce cardiovascular risk and may even 
increase it.5 6
The US Food and Drug Administration licensed the 
antiarrhythmic agents encainide and flecainide for use 
in patients on the basis of the drugs’ ability to reduce 
asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias associated with 
sudden death. This decision failed to acknowledge that 
because arrhythmia reduction reflected only indirectly
on the outcome of sudden death the quality of the 
evidence for the drugs’ benefit was of low quality. 
Subsequently, a randomised controlled trial showed 
that the two drugs increase the risk of sudden death.7
Appropriate attention to the low quality of the evidence 
would have saved thousands of lives.
Failure to recognise high quality evidence 
can cause similar problems. For instance, expert 
recommendations lagged a decade behind the evidence 
from well conducted randomised controlled trials that 
thrombolytic therapy achieved a reduction in mortality 
in myocardial infarction.8
Insufficient attention to quality of evidence risks 
inappropriate guidelines and recommendations that 
may lead clinicians to act to the detriment of their 
Guideline developers around the world are inconsist￾ent in how they rate quality of evidence and grade 
strength of recommendations. As a result, guideline 
users face challenges in understanding the messages 
that grading systems try to communicate. Since 2006 
the BMJ has requested in its “Instructions to Authors” 
on bmj.com that authors should preferably use the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop￾ment and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading 
evidence when submitting a clinical guidelines article. 
What was behind this decision?
In this first in a series of five articles we will explain 
why many organisations use formal systems to grade 
evidence and recommendations and why this is 
important for clinicians; we will focus on the GRADE 
approach to recommendations. In the next two articles 
we will examine how the GRADE system categorises 
quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. 
The final two articles will focus on recommendations 
for diagnostic tests and GRADE’s framework for tack￾ling the impact of interventions on use of resources.
GRADE has advantages over previous rating systems 
(box 1). Other systems share some of these advantages, 
but none, other than GRADE, combines them all.1
What is “quality of evidence” and why is it important?
In making healthcare management decisions, patients 
and clinicians must weigh up the benefits and down￾sides of alternative strategies. Decision makers will be 
influenced not only by the best estimates of the expected

ANALYSIS
indicate whether (a) the evidence is high quality and 
the desirable effects clearly outweigh the undesirable 
effects, or (b) there is a close or uncertain balance. A 
simple, transparent grading of the recommendation 
can effectively convey this key information.
There are limitations to formal grading of recom
-
mendations. Like the quality of evidence, the balance 
between desirable and undesirable effects reflects a con
-
tinuum. Some arbitrariness will therefore be associated 
with placing particular recommendations in categories 
such as “strong” and “weak.” Most organisations produc
-
ing guidelines have decided that the merits of an explicit 
grade of recommendation outweigh the disadvantages.
What makes a good grading system?
Not all grading systems separate decisions regarding 
the quality of evidence from strength of recommenda￾tions. Those that fail to do so create confusion. High 
quality evidence doesn’t necessarily imply strong 
recommendations, and strong recommendations can 
arise from low quality evidence.
For example, patients who experience a first deep 
venous thrombosis with no obvious provoking factor 
must, after the first months of anticoagulation, decide 
whether to continue taking warfarin long term. High 
quality randomised controlled trials show that continu
-
ing warfarin will decrease the risk of recurrent throm
-
bosis but at the cost of increased risk of bleeding and 
inconvenience. Because patients with varying values 
and preferences will make different choices, guideline 
panels addressing whether patients should continue 
or terminate warfarin should—despite the high quality 
evidence—offer a weak recommendation.
Consider the decision to administer aspirin or para￾cetamol (acetaminophen) to children with chicken 
pox. Observational studies have observed an associa
-
tion between aspirin administration and Reye’s syn
-
drome.
9
 Because aspirin and paracetamol are similar 
in their analgesic and antipyretic effects, the low qual
-
ity evidence regarding the association between aspi
-
rin and Reye’s syndrome does not preclude a strong 
recommendation for paracetamol.
Systems that classify “expert opinion” as a category 
of evidence also create confusion. Judgment is neces
-
sary for interpretation of all evidence, whether that 
evidence is high or low quality. Expert reports of 
their clinical experience should be explicitly labelled 
as very low quality evidence, along with case reports 
and other uncontrolled clinical observations.
Grading systems that are simple with respect to 
judgments both about the quality of the evidence 
and the strength of recommendations facilitate use 
by patients, clinicians, and policy makers.
1
 Detailed 
and explicit criteria for ratings of quality and grading 
of strength will make judgments more transparent to 
those using guidelines and recommendations.
Although many grading systems to some extent 
meet these criteria,
1
 a plethora of systems makes their 
use difficult for frontline clinicians. Understanding a 
variety of systems is neither an efficient nor a realistic 
use of clinicians’ time. The GRADE system is used 
patients. Recognising the quality of evidence will help 
to prevent these errors.
How should guideline developers alert clinicians to 
quality of evidence?
A formal system that categorises quality of evidence— 
for example, from high to very low—represents an 
obvious strategy for conveying quality of evidence to 
clinicians. Some limitations, however, do exist. Quality 
of evidence is a continuum; any discrete categorisation 
involves some degree of arbitrariness. Nevertheless, 
advantages of simplicity, transparency, and vividness 
outweigh these limitations.
What is “strength of recommendation” and why is it 
important?
A recommendation to offer patients a particular treat
-
ment may arise from large, rigorous randomised con
-
trolled trials that show consistent impressive benefits 
with few side effects and minimal inconvenience and 
cost. Such is the case with using a short course of 
oral steroids in patients with exacerbations of asthma. 
Clinicians can offer such treatments to almost all their 
patients with little or no hesitation.
Alternatively, treatment recommendations may 
arise from observational studies and may involve 
appreciable harms, burdens, or costs. Deciding 
whether to use antithrombotic therapy in pregnant 
women with prosthetic heart valves involves weigh
-
ing the magnitude of reduction in valve thrombosis 
against inconvenience, cost, and risk of teratogenesis. 
Clinicians offering such treatments must help patients 
to weigh up the desirable and undesirable effects care
-
fully according to their values and preferences.
Guidelines and recommendations must therefore

widely: the World Health Organization, the American 
College of Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, 
UpToDate (an electronic resource widely used in North 
America, www.uptodate.com), and the Cochrane Col￾laboration are among the more than 25 organisations 
that have adopted GRADE. This widespread adoption 
of GRADE reflects GRADE’s success as a methodo￾logically rigorous, user friendly grading system.
How does the GRADE system classify quality of 
evidence?
To achieve transparency and simplicity, the GRADE 
system classifies the quality of evidence in one of four 
levels—high, moderate, low, and very low (box 2). Some 
of the organisations using the GRADE system have cho￾sen to combine the low and very low categories. Evi￾dence based on randomised controlled trials begins as 
high quality evidence, but our confidence in the evidence 
may be decreased for several reasons, including:
• Study limitations
• Inconsistency of results
• Indirectness of evidence
• Imprecision
• Reporting bias.
Although observational studies (for example, cohort 
and case-control studies) start with a “low quality” 
rating, grading upwards may be warranted if the 
magnitude of the treatment effect is very large (such 
as severe hip osteoarthritis and hip replacement), if 
there is evidence of a dose-response relation or if all 
plausible biases would decrease the magnitude of an 
apparent treatment effect.
How does the GRADE system consider strength of 
recommendation?
The GRADE system offers two grades of recommenda￾tions: “strong” and “weak” (though guidelines panels 
may prefer terms such as “conditional” or “discretion￾ary” instead of weak). When the desirable effects of an 
intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, 
or clearly do not, guideline panels offer strong recom￾mendations. On the other hand, when the trade-offs are 
less certain—either because of low quality evidence or 
because evidence suggests that desirable and undesir￾able effects are closely balanced—weak recommenda￾tions become mandatory.
In addition to the quality of the evidence, several 
other factors affect whether recommendations are 
strong or weak (table 1).
Summary points
Failure to consider the quality of evidence can lead to misguided recommendations; 
hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women provides an instructive example 
High quality evidence that an intervention’s desirable effects are clearly greater than its 
undesirable effects, or are clearly not, warrants a strong recommendation
Uncertainty about the trade-offs (because of low quality evidence or because the desirable 
and undesirable effects are closely balanced) warrants a weak recommendation
Guidelines should inform clinicians what the quality of the underlying evidence is and 
whether recommendations are strong or weak
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE ) 
approach provides a system for rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations 
that is explicit, comprehensive, transparent, and pragmatic and is increasingly being 
adopted by organisations worldwide
