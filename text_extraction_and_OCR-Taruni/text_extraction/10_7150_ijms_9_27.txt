Abstract
Background/Aims: Spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection occasionally occurs in its natural history, sometimes leading rapidly to fatal hepatic 
failure. We compared the effects of lamivudine (LAM) with those of entecavir (ETV) treat￾ments in acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B with 500 IU/L or higher alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT) levels.
Methods: Thirty-four patients with acute exacerbation were consecutively treated with 
LAM /ETV. Their clinical improvements were compared.
Results: Among LAM-treated and ETV-treated patients, none showed a reduction of <1 log
IU/mL in HBV DNA after 1 or 3 months of treatment. Initial virological response, defined as a 
reduction of 4 log IU/mL in HBV DNA at 6 months, with LAM and ETV, respectively, was
83.3% and 100%. One LAM patient developed hepatic encephalopathy, but all patients in both 
groups survived. Twelve months after treatment, 41.6% of 24 LAM group patients switched to 
another drug or added adefovir to their treatment due to the emergence of LAM-resistant 
mutants. On the other hand, patients receiving ETV did not need to change drugs. 
Conclusions: ETV appears to be as effective as LAM in the treatment of patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. Clinicians should carefully start to treat these patients as 
soon as possible.
Key words: acute exacerbation, ALT, entecavir, HBV, lamivudine
INTRODUCTION
Chronic hepatitis B infection is associated with 
the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. In￾fection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) also leads to wide 
a spectrum of liver injury, including acute, 
self-limited infection, fulminant hepatitis, and chronic 
hepatitis with progression to cirrhosis and liver fail￾ure, as well as to an asymptomatic chronic carrier 
state [2, 3]. 
Reactivation of hepatitis B is a well-characterized 
syndrome marked by the abrupt reappearance or rise 
of HBV DNA in the serum of a patient with previ￾ously inactivated or resolved HBV infection [4]. Reac￾Ivyspring

tivation is often spontaneous, but can also be trig￾gered by cancer chemotherapy and immune suppres￾sion. Spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic hep￾atitis B infection is seen with a cumulative probability 
of 15-37% after 4 years of follow-up [5]. Prognosis is 
generally poor in HBV carriers with spontaneous 
acute exacerbation together with high alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT) levels, jaundice, and liver failure 
[4, 6, 7]. This condition has been defined as 
acute-on-chronic liver failure according to a recent 
Asia-Pacific consensus recommendation [8]. Acute 
exacerbation occasionally leads to a critical scenario, 
meaning that clinicians need to treat this condition 
immediately.
Lamivudine (LAM) is a reverse-transcriptase in￾hibitor of viral DNA polymerase with an excellent 
profile of safety and tolerability, causing inhibition of 
viral replication, and it is approved for antiviral 
treatment of hepatitis B patients [9, 10]. LAM sup￾presses serum HBV DNA values in up to 98% of pa￾tients within a median period of 4 weeks, leading to 
aminotransferase normalization, increased hepatitis B 
e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rate, and im￾provement of histological parameters [11, 12]. A study 
from Taiwan showed that LAM had a survival benefit 
and was effective for patients with baseline bilirubin 
levels below 20 mg/dL [7].
Entecavir (ETV), a deoxyguanosine analogue, is 
a potent and selective inhibitor of HBV replication; its 
in vitro potency is 100- to 1,000-fold greater than that 
of LAM, and it has a selectivity index (concentration 
of drug reducing the viable cell number by 50% 
[CC50]/concentration of drug reducing viral replica￾tion by 50% [EC50]) of ~8,000 [13, 14]. At present, the
Japanese national health insurance system approves 
ETV as the first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B, 
although some patients are treated with standard in￾terferon-alfa. ETV is a nucleoside analogue (NUC) 
belonging to a new subgroup, cyclopentane [15], and
it has been shown to be highly effective in suppress￾ing HBV replication to an undetectable level and 
normalizing ALT, although NUCs do not eradicate 
the virus. ETV develops less resistance than LAM.
We undertook a retrospective study to compare 
the efficacy of LAM with that of ETV in the reduction 
of HBV DNA levels and associated improvement in 
disease severity and biochemical recovery in patients 
with acute exacerbation together with higher ALT 
levels due to HBV reactivation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A retrospective analysis of LAM/ETV-treated 
chronic hepatitis B patients at Chiba University Hos￾pital and Numazu City Hospital, Japan, between May 
2003 and December 2009 was performed. The inclu￾sion criteria were: acute exacerbation of chronic hep￾atitis B characterized by an elevation of ALT level ≥
500 IU/L along with HBV DNA ≥ 4.5 log IU/mL 
presenting in a patient with diagnosed chronic liver 
disease. The exclusion criteria were: acute hepatitis B, 
superinfection with other viruses (hepatitis E, A, D, or 
C), other causes of chronic liver failure [16, 17], coex￾istent hepatocellular carcinoma, portal thrombosis, 
coexistent renal impairment, pregnancy, coinfection 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or pa￾tients who had received a previous course of NUC 
treatment. This retrospective study protocol conforms 
to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of 
Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Ethics 
Committee of Chiba University, Graduate School of 
Medicine [18].
Baseline assessment of patients
Retrospectively collected data included patient 
demographics, clinical findings, all laboratory varia￾bles including virological tests and abdominal ultra￾sound. HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody and im￾munoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc antibody were de￾termined by ELISA (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) or 
CLEIA (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) [19]. HBV genotype 
was determined from patients’ sera by ELISA (Insti￾tute of Immunology, Tokyo, Japan) as reported by 
Usuda et al [20]. HBV DNA was measured by Roche 
AmplicorTM PCR assay (detection limits: 2.6 log 
IU/mL; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan).
Definitions
Primary antiviral treatment failure was defined 
as a reduction of < 1 log IU/mL in HBV DNA after 3 
months of therapy. Initial virological response (IVR) 
was defined as a reduction of ≥ 4 log IU/mL in HBV 
DNA after 6 months of therapy [21].
Follow-up
Clinical assessment and routine investigations
were done every 15 days or every month for at least 6 
months. HBV DNA measurements were repeated
monthly.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Mi￾crosoft Excel 2010 for WindowsTM 7 and StatView 5 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Continuous variables 
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and 
were compared by two-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and two-way repeated measures ANOVA. 
Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square

test. Baseline was taken as the date when the first dose 
of LAM/ETV was administered. Statistical signifi￾cance was considered at a P-value < 0.05.
RESULTS
Patients
Between May 2003 and December 2009, 34 pa￾tients with spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic 
hepatitis B, with ALT levels ≥ 500 IU/mL and treated 
with LAM or ETV, were consecutively enrolled and 
retrospectively analyzed. 24 (70.5%) were treated with 
LAM at 100 mg daily and 10 (29.4%) were treated with 
ETV at 0.5 mg daily. All patients were followed for at 
least 6 months. Mean follow-up in the LAM and ETV 
groups was 55.5 ± 25.4 and 16.5 ± 9.9 months, respec￾tively.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics in the two patient groups 
were similar (Table 1). Median age was 37 (21-73) 
years and 79.4% were men. One patient of the LAM 
group developed hepatic encephalopathy, but recov￾ered. All patients in both groups survived. At admis￾sion, the serological profile showed HBsAg positivity 
in all 34 (100%); 22 (64.7%) were HBeAg positive. The 
median HBV DNA level was 7.4 log IU/mL in the 
LAM group and 7.9 log IU/mL in the ETV group 
(Table 1).

Reduction in HBV DNA of total patients
LAM significantly reduced HBV DNA levels 
from baseline 7.24 log IU/mL to 3.27 log IU/mL at 1 
month (P < 0.001), to 2.21 log IU/mL at 3 months (P <

ETV also significantly reduced HBV DNA levels from 
baseline 7.56 log IU/mL to 3.12 log IU/mL at 1 month 
(P < 0.001), to 2.14 log IU/mL at 3 months (P < 0.001), 
and to 1.77 log IU/mL at 6 months (P < 0.001). There 
were no differences in HBV DNA levels from baseline 
to 6 months between the two groups. None with pri￾mary antiviral treatment failure was identified in ei￾ther group. There were no significant differences in 
IVR between the two groups (Figure 1).
Reduction in ALT levels of total patients
LAM significantly reduced ALT levels from 
baseline 1,130 IU/mL to 102 (P < 0.001) at 1 month, to 
28.6 (P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 23.1 (P < 0.001) at 6 
months. ETV also significantly reduced ALT levels 
from baseline 1,210 IU/mL to 117 (P < 0.001) at 1 
month, to 25 (P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 24.4 (P < 
0.001) at 6 months. There were no differences in ALT 
levels from baseline to 6 months between the two 
groups (Figure 2).

Reduction in HBV DNA of HBeAg-positive 
patients
It has been demonstrated that the levels of HBV 
DNA in the HBeAg-positive phase were generally 
higher than those in the ant-HBe-positive phase [19, 
22]. HBeAg positivity is also associated with HBV 
viremia and increased ALT levels in HIV/HBV 
co-infected patients [23]. Next, we compared the re￾sponse to LAM or ETV in 18 or 4 HBeAg-positive pa￾tients, respectively (Table 2). LAM significantly re￾duced HBV DNA levels from baseline 7.52 log IU/mL 
to 3.35 log IU/mL (P < 0.001) at 1 month, to 2.38 log 
IU/mL (P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 1.55 log IU/mL 
(P < 0.001) at 6 months. ETV also significantly reduced 
HBV DNA levels from baseline 8.42 log IU/mL to 3.87 
log IU/mL (P < 0.001) at 1 month, to 2.90 log IU/mL
(P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 2.22 log IU/mL (P < 
0.001) at 6 months. There were no differences in HBV 
DNA levels from baseline to 6 months between the 
two groups. Primary antiviral treatment failure was 
not observed in either group. Four patients in the 
LAM group did not achieve IVR.

Reduction in ALT levels of HBeAg-positive 
patients
LAM significantly reduced ALT levels from 
baseline 1,150 IU/mL to 84 (P < 0.001) at 1 month, to 
27.5 (P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 22.0 (P < 0.001) at 6 
months. ETV also significantly reduced ALT levels 
from baseline 1,460 IU/mL to 230 (P = 0.0038) at 1 
month, to 22.2 (P = 0.0016) at 3 months, and to 24.0 (P
= 0.0016) at 6 months. At 1 month after treatment, the 
ALT levels of the LAM groups were lower than those 
of the ETV group (P < 0.0001) (Figure 3). During fol￾low-up periods, 10 and 1 sero-converters of HBeAg to 
anti-HBe antibody phase were seen in 18 LAM-treated 
and in 4 ETV-treated patients, respectively.

levels in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine (N=18) vs.

Safety
No patient stopped taking medications. Twelve
months after treatment, 10 of 24 patients (41.6%) in the 
LAM group switched from LAM to ETV (n=4) or 
added adefovir (n=6) due to the emergence of 
LAM-resistant mutants. On the other hand, patients 
receiving ETV did not need to change their medica￾tion.
DISCUSSION
The present study compared the use of NUCs, 
LAM and ETV, for the treatment of acute exacerbation 
of chronic hepatitis B. The results clearly showed sig￾nificant benefits of a rapid reduction of HBV DNA 
levels, compared with untreated patients in a previ￾ous report [4]. 
It was reported that ETV treatment is associated 
with increased short-term mortality in patients with 
severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B, but 
that it achieves better virological response in the long 
run [24]. We used LAM or ETV for patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B presenting with 
ALT ≥ 500 IU/L in the present study. The effects of 
LAM on HBV DNA levels were the same as those of 
ETV (Figure 1). But the effects of LAM on ALT levels 
after 1 month were stronger than those of ETV in 
HBeAg-positive patients (Figure 3). In spite of the 
limited number of these patients, the effects were 
possibly related to immunomodulating activities of 
LAM [25]. The patients’ prognoses were more favor￾able than in the previous report [4]. This might have

depended on the fact that, in the present study, 
treatment was begun as soon as possible, and some 
patients may have had a milder grade of acute exac￾erbation of chronic hepatitis B than those in the pre￾vious report [4]. We believe that patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B need to be sub￾jected to treatment as promptly as possible.
The major routes of HBV infection in our country 
have been mother-to-child transmission and blood 
transfusion. However, cases with HBV transmitted 
through sexual contact are increasing, especially 
among HIV-1-seropositive patients [26]. One should 
bear in mind that knowledge about interactions be￾tween ETV and anti-HIV nucleoside analogues is 
limited [27]. Because long-term use of LAM induces 
LAM-resistant mutants [28], we can only use LAM for 
short-term treatment of patients with acute exacerba￾tion of chronic hepatitis B. On the other hand, the 
present study also revealed that patients receiving 
ETV did not need to change drugs.
Recently, there have been several reports that 
reactivation of HBV is a fatal complication following 
systemic chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive 
therapy including rituximab and steroid therapies 
mainly in HBsAg-positive and -negative lymphoma 
patients. It is important to enable early diagnosis of 
HBV reactivation as well as initiation of antiviral 
therapy [29, 30].
In conclusion, ETV appears to be as effective as 
LAM in the treatment of patients with acute exacer￾bation of chronic hepatitis B. Clinicians should start to 
treat these patients with NUCs as soon as possible.
