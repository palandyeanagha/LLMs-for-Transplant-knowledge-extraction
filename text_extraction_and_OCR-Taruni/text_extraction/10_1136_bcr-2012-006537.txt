Summary
Renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition that is often difficult to diagnose. Rarely, it
can occur as a complication associated with a percutaneous renal biopsy procedure. The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic
lesions found incidentally on imaging studies to a mass causing high blood pressure, pain, haematuria and rupture. Although the risk of
rupture is considered low, RAP is associated with a high death rate if ruptured. Currently, with the aid of high-quality interventional
radiology, this challenging pathology can be effectively treated. In this report, we describe a case of RAP that was incidentally discovered
4 years after percutaneous renal biopsy which was successfully treated with selective angiographic embolisation.
BACKGROUND
A percutaneous renal biopsy of native or allograft kidneys
is a useful procedure in the diagnosis of various renal
diseases. As evidenced by several reports on large series
of patients undergoing percutaneous renal biopsy, the
procedure is generally safe with low morbidity and
mortality.1 Although the risks are minimal, postrenal
biopsy complications include perirenal haematoma, lacer￾ation of the collecting system, arteriovenous fistula, for￾mation of a perirenal abscess, anuria and haematuria.1 2
In contrast, renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP), a rare
complication of percutaneous renal procedures, is of great
clinical significance because of its propensity to rupture.2–4
RAPs mainly develop after laparoscopic partial nephrec￾tomy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, traumatic penetrat￾ing and blunt renal injuries.5–7 Symptomatic RAPs after
renal biopsy are accompanied by massive gross haematuria,
urinary clot retention and bladder tamponade, and in the
case of ruptured pseudoaneurysms, by gastrointestinal
bleeding.6 7 In this report, we present a successfully treated
case of a 50-year-old woman with an asymptomatic RAP
incidentally found on screening abdominal sonography
4 years after percutaneous biopsy of the native kidney.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 50-year-old woman visited our clinic with an incidental
finding of an approximately 1 cm sized haematoma of the
left kidney during a health screening abdominal sonog￾raphy. The patient had no complaints or symptoms refer￾able to the intrarenal lesion before discovery by abdominal
imaging. She was diagnosed with membranous glomerulo￾nephritis stage III confirmed by renal biopsy 4 years prior.
She was discharged on that occasion without any acute
complications, with the abdominal sonography showing
only a small amount of perirenal haematoma after the
biopsy (figure 1).
INVESTIGATIONS
On assessment at our clinic, the physical examination
was unremarkable and blood pressure was normal.
Laboratory data showed a haemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dl
and a white cell count of 6.14×103
/ml with a normal dif￾ferential cell count. Urinalysis showed positive occult
blood test without proteinuria. Serum chemistry levels
including renal function markers were within normal
limits. Contrast-enhanced CT of the kidney showed a
2 cm renal mass with a strongly enhancing anterior half
and a cyst-like posterior half in the lower pole of the left
kidney. Radiological appearances corresponded with a par￾tially thrombosed pseudoanueurysm (figure 2).
TREATMENT
Embolisation using a 6 mm×7 cm microcoil was done
and postembolisation angiography showed a well￾occluded feeding artery (figure 3). There were no signs of

postembolisation syndrome or contrast-medium-induced
nephrotoxicity. The patient was discharged 1 day after the
embolisation.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
A follow-up CT scan 3 months after the embolisation
showed total occlusion of the RAP with chronic renal
infarction in the lower pole of the left kidney (figure 4).
DISCUSSION
RAP is a rare clinical entity that has been reported after
renal biopsy, percutaneous renal surgery, kidney trans￾plantation, penetrating trauma and blunt renal trauma.
Blood passage from a lacerated artery to the renal paren￾chyma leads to RAP. The walls of a true aneurysm
contain one or more of the original arterial coats while
the walls of a false aneurysm ( pseudoaneurysm) derive
from tissues surrounding the arteries.8 After the initial
renal injury, a combination of hypotension, coagulation
and pressure from the surrounding tissues such as the
vascular adventitia, renal parenchyma and Gerota’s fascia
result in temporary cessation of the bleeding.
Degradation of the clot and surrounding necrotic tissue
results in recanalisation between the intravascular and
extravascular space, and subsequently, the formation of a
pseudoaneurysm. With restoration of normal blood flow,
this pseudoaneurysm can grow and eventually become
unstable, with erosion into the surrounding perinephric
tissue.7
Symptoms may include abdominal tenderness, abdom￾inal mass, haematuria, hypertension and shock. Signs and
symptoms of the RAP may develop immediately after the
insult or they may be delayed.3 Mima et al3 reported a
case in which massive haematuria, urinary clot rentention
and bladder tamponade 7 h after the percutaneous renal
biopsy were the presenting signs of RAP. Haematuria is
the most common symptom associated with RAPs and
results from erosion of the RAP into the adjacent renal
collecting system9
; this may occur within 2–4 weeks after
the injury. One series study showed that average presenta￾tion time was 17 days after the original injury including
blunt and penetrating injuries.7 However, patients can
present with non-specific symptoms so that RAP is inci￾dentally found. In one case presented with haematuria
only, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysm were diag￾nosed 10 years after kidney allograft biopsy.2 Therefore, it
is difficult to diagnose an RAP without a high index of
suspicion. These findings suggest that after renal biopsy it
is necessary to periodically evaluate the kidney using
imaging studies.2
Figure 3 (A) Left renal angiography shows a 2 cm sized saccular pseudoaneurysm at the lower pole of the left kidney with an early
draining vein. (B) Angiography after embolisation using a microcoil shows a well-occluded feeding artery. The absence of filling of the
pseudoaneurysm with contrast material indicates successful embolisation.
Figure 2 (A) Contrast-enhanced CT in the arterial phase shows a 2 cm sized renal mass with a strong enhancing anterior half and a
cyst-like posterior half in the lower pole of the left kidney, suggesting a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm. (B) Coronal image
demonstrates a vascular connection to the contrast medium collection, confirming the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm.

In fact, the diagnosis of RAP is challenging.
Angiography has been the standard tool for diagnosis.
However, if the patient is stable, non-invasive tests such
as contrast medium-enhanced CT, colour Dopper sonog￾raphy or magnetic resonance angiography should be per￾formed.6 The advantage of CT is that it enables imaging
of the entire urinary tract, and is the technique of choice
for follow-up.10 RAP is best seen on the arterial phase,
appearing as a focal high attenuation lesion with a
density similar to that of the adjacent arterial vessels. The
RAP may also be visible in the nephrographic phase, but
may sometimes be missed when the adjacent renal paren￾chyma is densely enhanced, masking the high density of
the pseudoaneurysm. The RAP will not be seen in the
pyelographic phase due to washout of contrast material
from the pseudoaneurysm.5 Pseudoaneurysm may resem￾ble a cystic mass on sonography. The ultrasound findings
alone, therefore, may not be sufficient to distinguish a
haematoma from a pseudoaneurysm. However, colour
Doppler sonography shows characteristic to-and-fro flow
within the mass. If imaging findings are not conclusive
and there is clinical suspicion of RAP or the patient is
haemodynamically unstable, angiography should be
undertaken. In addition to high sensitivity in identifying
the RAP, the advantages of angiography include the
potential to achieve simultaneous endovascular manage￾ment of RAP.11 Embolisation of RAP has been reported to
have high success rates exceeding 90%.11 12
The risk of rupture is estimated to be low, but it is asso￾ciated with a death rate as high as 80%.13 Currently, no
consensus exists for the size at which an RAP should be
repaired in an asymptomatic patient. In general, aneur￾ysms greater than 2 cm in diameter are considered to have
a high risk of rupture. The incidental, asymptomatic and
2 cm sized RAP in our patient creates a dilemma of man￾agement: opinions among the physicians in our clinic
were varied with respect to the influence of the RAP size
of the likelihood of severe clinical presentation such as
rupture or deterioration in renal function. In fact, it has
been reported that most pseudoaneurysms are small and
asymptomatic and sometimes resolve spontaneously.14
Some clinicians followed a successful conservative treat￾ment of a RAP detected incidentally,9 although there is a
growing tendency to prefer active interventions.15
However, growth of the pseudoaneurysm may occur
rapidly. A previous report showed diameter evolving from
17 to 30 mm within 2 months.16 Another report demon￾strated that a pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed at 30 mm
while a CT scan performed 2 months before was
normal.17 Given that ruptures have also been reported in
smaller aneurysms if left untreated, it was decided that an
intervention on the RAP would decrease the risk of ultim￾ate rupture.18
Management methods of RAP are also a challenging
issue, and a variety of treatment modalities have been
exploited so far.9 Treatment of renal artery pseudoaneur￾ysm can be by nephrectomy, open vascular surgery or
angiographic embolisation, depending on the patient’s
clinical condition. Surgical indications for repair include
overt ruptures, an aneurysm greater than 2 cm, renovascu￾lar hypertension, expansion of the aneurysm and evidence
of renal damage.9 In general, angiographic embolisation is
the procedure of choice due to its minimally invasive and
selective nature and the maximal preservation of renal
parenchyma.3 However, embolisation for the management
of RAP appears to have some shortcomings, such as pos￾sible reflux of embolic material into the normal proximal
vessel if the distal branch has not been selectively cannu￾lated and the risk of more generalised ischaemia resulting
from thrombosis of a main feeding branch.9 11 In order to
overcome these limitations, treatment with covered stent￾grafts on RAP located in branches of visceral arteries has
been suggested.11 In selected cases, the use of ultrasound￾guided thrombin injection into an extracapsular pseudoa￾neurysm following renal allograft biopsy can also be
considered a treatment option.19
In conclusion, we herein showed a case of a 50-year-old
woman with asymptomatic RAP diagnosed 4 years after
percutaneous native renal biopsy. The RAP was treated
with percutaneous selective angioembolisation and
follow-up imaging showed successful resolution without
evidence of complications. Clinicians need to bear in mind
that patients with a history of minimally invasive inter￾vention of the kidneys may have RAP. It is also necessary
to follow up patients with imaging studies to prevent a
sudden disastrous rupture of the RAP.
Figure 4 (A,B) Follow-up CT scan 3 months after the embolisation shows total occlusion of the renal artery pseudoaneurysm with
chronic renal infarction in the lower pole of the left kidney.

Learning points
▸ Renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is a rare but fatal
complication of percutaneous renal biopsy.
▸ Management of renal RAP consists of elective or
urgent selective embolisation depending on the size of
the pseudoaneurysm and the severity of presentation.
▸ Recognition of pseudoaneurysm is critical, as the
follow-up with imaging studies after percutaneous
kidney biopsy leads to appropriate intervention.
