Thymically derived Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (tTregs) constitute a unique T cell lineage that
is essential for maintaining immune tolerance to self and immune homeostasis. However,
Foxp3 can also be turned on in conventionalT cells as a consequence of antigen exposure in
the periphery, under both non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. These so-called
peripheral Tregs (pTregs) participate in the control of immunity at sites of inflammation,
especially at the mucosal surfaces. Although numerous studies have assessed in vitro
generated Tregs (termed induced or iTregs), these cells most often do not recapitulate the
functional or phenotypic characteristics of in vivo generated pTregs. Thus, there are still
many unanswered questions regarding the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and function of
pTregs as well as conditions under which they are generated in vivo, and the degree to
which these characteristics identify specialized features of pTregs versus features that are
shared with tTregs. In this review, we summarize the current state of our understanding
of pTregs and their relationship to the tTreg subset. We describe the recent discovery of
unique cell surface markers and transcription factors (including Neuropilin-1 and Helios) that
can be used to distinguish tTreg and pTreg subsets in vivo. Additionally, we discuss how
the improved ability to distinguish these subsets provided new insights into the biology of
tTregs versus pTregs and suggested differences in their function and TCR repertoire, con￾sistent with a unique role of pTregs in certain inflammatory settings. Finally, these recent
advances will be used to speculate on the role of individual Treg subsets in both tolerance
and autoimmunity.

INTRODUCTION
Immune tolerance is a key feature of the immune system that is
designed to preserve self-tissues while allowing effective responses
against infections. While most autoreactive T cells are deleted
centrally in the thymus, peripheral T cells harbor self-reactive T
cells that are kept in check by a number of intrinsic and extrin￾sic immunoregulatory mechanisms, among which suppressor or
regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role. The importance of
Tregs in maintaining peripheral tolerance to self-tissues is evi￾denced in both mice and humans by the fatal autoimmune disease
that results from a loss of function mutation in the Foxp3 gene,
the master transcription factor expressed selectively in Tregs (1–
3). Tregs arise both in the thymus (tTregs) and extrathymically in
the periphery (pTregs) as a consequence of induction of Foxp3
upon antigen exposure (4, 5). This nomenclature used to describe
Treg subsets in this review is based on the recent recommenda￾tions by prominent researchers in the field (5). The discovery
that TGF-β induces Foxp3 expression and suppressive activity
in conventional T cells in vitro raised the possibility that Tregs
could be extrathymically generated from naïve T cells in both
mice (6, 7) and humans (8). However, signals that lead to the
generation of pTregsin vivo have been less clearly defined. Histori￾cally, sub-immunogenic doses of antigen (9) as well as endogenous
expression of foreign antigen in a lymphopenic environment (10)
have been shown to induce pTregs in vivo. It is now becoming
increasingly clear that pTregs arise in various conditions and could
constitute a significant portion of Tregs in the periphery, especially
in tissues such as the lamina propria (11). This also raises the
question of whether pTregs are functionally similar to tTregs. Are
pTregs induced to carry out a specific function or are they merely
generated as a byproduct of antigen exposure in the periphery?
Neonatal thymectomy experiments in mice strongly suggest that
Tregs generated in the thymus are key to immune tolerance and
peripherally generated Tregs are not sufficient to keep autoreac￾tive cells in check (12–14). However, recently, pTregs have been
shown to perform indispensable functions in controlling autoim￾mune responses under certain inflammatory conditions (15–17).
With recent advances in the ability to distinguish thymic versus
peripherally derived Tregs using neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) and Helios,
specific differences in gene expression, epigenetic modification,
and the stability of Foxp3 expression between these two subsets
are starting to emerge. Further defining their commonalities and
differences will be important for elucidating biological functions
and contributions of each Treg subset in maintaining peripheral
tolerance, as well as their respective role in a variety of disease
settings ranging from autoimmunity to cancer and infectious dis￾eases. Of note, other subsets of Foxp3− regulatory T cells with
suppressor functions have been described, such as IL-10 producing

Tr1 cells and TGF-β producing Th3 cells. However, in this review,
we will focus on Foxp3+ tTregs and pTregs, highlighting key find￾ings and recent progress in the field, and discussing the remaining
unanswered questions.
CHARACTERISTICS OF pTREGS
Ever since it was discovered that TGF-β plays a key role in inducing
Foxp3 expression in naïve T cells in vitro, there has been a consid￾erable amount of interest in determining if a similar conversion of
conventional T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs takes place in vivo. While
Foxp3 is a critical orchestrator of Treg biology, it is not enough by
itself to drive their full transcriptional program (18–21). Neither
the induction of Foxp3 by TGF-β nor its exogenous expression by
retroviral transduction can fully recapitulate the canonical Treg
signature or the suppressive activities of tTregs (19, 20). Hence,
in vitro generated iTregs may not replicate the true phenotype of
in vivo peripherally generated Tregs and therefore are not ideal for
studying pTregs.
Early evidence that pTregs were generated in vivo came from
studies performed before the identification of Foxp3 as the mas￾ter transcription factor for Tregs (22). Interestingly, pTregs in these
studies were shown to exhibit a true Treg phenotype and to express
canonical Treg markers such as CTLA-4, GITR, and CD103.
Although the role of antigen exposure was not addressed in those
studies, the requirement for IL-2 was clearly established. Later on,
it was shown that optimal induction of pTregs is associated with
non-immunogenic antigen delivery methods such as oral or intra￾venous injection, peptide pumps, or antibody-mediated DC tar￾geting in the absence of adjuvants (9, 23). In vivo converted pTregs
are effective suppressors in in vitro assays (9, 10, 24, 25) whereas
TGF-β induced iTregs are not fully suppressive and acquire only a
portion of the Treg transcriptional signature (6, 8, 19, 26) further
highlighting the differences between iTregs and pTregs.
Feuerer et al. performed a comprehensive gene-expression
analysis to characterize Foxp3+ Tregs generated under different
conditions in vivo. Their analysis showed a remarkable hetero￾geneity between different populations, which perhaps highlighted
the true adaptive nature of pTregs (20). Helios, an ikaros family
transcription factor, was recently described as a specific marker for
tTregs. Indeed, Thornton et al. reported that Helios is expressed
highly on Foxp3+ Tregs in the thymus while approximately 70%
of Tregs express Helios in the periphery (27). They suggested that
these Helios+ cells may represent tTregs and that Helios could
be used to distinguish between thymus- and periphery-generated
Tregs. However, others have argued that Helios is induced during
T cell activation and proliferation, and can also be upregulated in
Foxp3+ iTregs in vitro and pTregs in vivo (28, 29). In addition to
the these controversies, Helios is localized intracellularly and thus
has a limited value as a marker to separate the two subsets of Tregs
for functional studies.
We recently generated a myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific
T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) named 1B3 mouse in
which pTregs were spontaneously generated in the periphery
when these mice were crossed onto the RAG-2 knockout back￾ground. Through a series of experiments utilizing pTregs from
this strain, we found that Nrp-1 was expressed on tTregs only
and that Nrp-1 expression could be used to distinguish tTregs
from peripherally generated pTregs in other settings (30). Con￾sistent with the MBP.TCR.Tg 1B3 mouse, pTregs generated with
low dose-antigen in ovalbumin-specific TCR.Tg BALB/c mice also
failed to express Nrp-1, indicating that a lack of Nrp-1 expres￾sion is a general feature of pTregs. The Lafaille group reported
similar findings where mucosa-generated pTregs expressed low
levels of Nrp-1 in contrast to tTregs. This was further addressed
in studies in mice lacking conserved non-coding elements at the
Foxp3 locus (CNS1), the region that has binding sites for Smad 3
and the retinoic acid receptor. CNS1−/− mice have normal num￾bers of tTregs but show severe impairment in the development of
pTregs (16, 31). The frequency of Nrp-1−Foxp3+ Tregs is greatly
reduced in the periphery in the CNS1−/− mice, which is con￾sistent with a lack of pTregs. The defects were most striking at
mucosal surfaces, which are the primary sites for pTreg genera￾tion. Finally, Foxp3+ Tregs in the thymus express high levels of
Nrp-1, although a small proportion of Nrp-1lo cells are present
among CD8−CD4+Foxp3+ cells. Not surprisingly, this subset is
restricted to the CD24hiQa-2lo immature thymocyte subset, sug￾gesting that tTregs upregulate Nrp-1 before they mature in the
thymus (30). Weiss et al. further validated this finding in a series
of experiments showing that Nrp-1lo Foxp3+ cells in the thymus
upregulate Nrp-1 before exiting the thymus (31). Of note, expres￾sion of Nrp-1 can distinguish pTregs and tTregs in circulating cells
but not inflamed tissues since pTregs can upregulate Nrp-1 during
inflammation, as discussed in the next section.
Epigenetic regulation of gene-expression plays an important
role in differentiation and stabilization of T cell lineages (32, 33).
In tTregs, demethylation of CpG islands in Foxp3 conserved non￾coding region 2 (Treg-specific demethylation region or TSDR) is a
hallmark feature and is thought to reflect stable, constitutive Foxp3
expression in this population (34). In vitro induction of Foxp3 by
TGF-β is not sufficient to induce TSDR demethylation, whereas
in vivo generated pTregs exhibit variable patterns. Some of the
initial studies showed that in vivo generated pTregs have demethy￾lated TSDR (35), although, this has been contradicted in recent
studies showing that pTregs express methylated CpG motifs in
TSDR (15). This, as discussed above, may reflect differences in the
animal models used or perhaps may be due to the heterogeneity
of the pTreg population. In our studies, pTregs that were isolated
based on Nrp-1 expression show a pattern similar to tTregs with
>85% demethylation in TSDR. Similarly, a recent study by Miyao
et al. (36) showed that pTregs, once stabilized in vivo, display a
demethylated TSDR (36). Recently, the Sakaguchi group further
established that Treg development is contingent upon on CpG
demethylation not only in the TSDR but also in signature genes
such as Tnfrsf18, CTLA-4, Ikzf4, and Il2ra (37). Demethylation
in these genes in tTregs establishes a tTreg-type CpG hypomethy￾lation pattern, which is required for full Treg cell development
in addition to Foxp3 expression. Interestingly, in vivo converted
pTregs in their studies exhibited remarkable demethylation in the
genes listed above, similar to what was observed in tTregs (37).
Thus, Treg development is not solely dictated by the epigenetic
regulation of Foxp3 but is achieved by the establishment of Treg￾specific demethylation patterns and future epigenetic studies of
pTregs need to include not only TSDR but also other signature
genes to determine a fully committed Treg state.

ARE TREGS IN TISSUES COMPRISED MOSTLY OF pTREGS?
During inflammation Treg numbers increase in the relevant tis￾sue and could constitute up to 50% of all CD4+ T cells. Tregs
in tissues exhibit a unique phenotype that is reminiscent of the
tissue microenvironment, as exemplified by PPARγ expression
in Tregs in the adipose tissue (38). The term “tissular Tregs”
has been used to define these tissue-resident Tregs (39). Tissu￾lar Tregs are not only important in controlling inflammation
locally but also perform unique functions (which may be direct
or indirect) such as controlling insulin sensitivity in the fat (40).
Unpublished observations from our group further indicate that
Tregs in tissues such as the muscle may be involved in tissue
remodeling during an inflammatory or damage response (Vil￾lalta et al., unpublished observations). However, where these Tregs
originate from is still unclear. They could arise in the thymus
and accumulate in the tissue due to migration and prolifera￾tion in response to inflammation. Conversely, there is a strong
possibility that these Treg cells are generated by conversion of
CD4+CD25− conventional T cells (Tconv cells) upon antigen
encounter in the tissue. In support of this hypothesis, a recent
study showed that tissue-resident macrophages play a key role in
generation of pTregs in lungs. These macrophages coexpressed
TGF-β and retinal dehydrogenases (RALDH1 and RALDH 2)
under steady-state conditions and sampling of airborne antigens
by these macrophages and presentation to antigen-specific CD4
T cells resulted in the generation of tissue-resident Foxp3+ Tregs
(41). In ongoing studies in our lab, we have observed the accu￾mulation of Tregs in muscles during inflammation. The origin of
these Foxp3+ Tregs is still not known but they express high lev￾els of Nrp-1 (Villalta et al., unpublished observations), suggesting
their thymic origin. However, pTregs have been shown to upreg￾ulate Nrp-1 expression, especially in tissues during inflammation.
Indeed, pTregs upregulate Nrp-1 during EAE or lung inflamma￾tion, and we also observed upregulation of Nrp-1 expression on
pTregs during autoimmune response in pancreas (unpublished
observations). Thus, Nrp-1-expressing Tregs present in inflamed
tissues may not solely be thymically derived but could be gen￾erated by conversion. We believe that presence of pTregs could
play a critical role in controlling local inflammatory responses
in tissues and may have clinical significance for certain human
diseases.
DIFFERENCES IN pTREG VERSUS tTREG DEVELOPMENT
It has been postulated that tTreg development in the thymus
is associated with high affinity TCR/MHC-peptide interactions
while pTreg differentiation in the periphery is induced under sub￾immunogenic conditions (9, 23, 31, 42, 43). This was evident
in studies utilizing adoptive transfers of antigen-specific T cells,
where the largest induction of Foxp3 in the periphery occurred
after priming with low doses of their cognate antigen (44, 45).
Interestingly, a low dose of high affinity agonist peptide sup￾ports pTreg induction while a low affinity peptide agonist poorly
generates pTregs (46).
The relationship between the signaling pathways that promote
the development of tTregs in the thymus and that elicit conversion
into pTregs in the periphery is not entirely clear. TCR engage￾ment and IL-2 signaling are indispensable for generation of all
Tregs but pTregs require additional factors such as TGF-β and
retinoic acid (47, 48). Blockade of TGF-β in vivo inhibits differ￾entiation of antigen-specific pTregs (49). In mice lacking binding
sites for smad3 in the Foxp3 enhancer region (CNS1), there is a
lack of pTregs development (16). When congenically marked WT
or CNS1−/−CD4+Foxp3− T cells were transferred into RAG1−/−
recipient mice, the induction of Foxp3 was observed only in WT
and not in the CNS1−/− cells. Similarly, the in vitro assay demon￾strated a significant reduction in the induction of Foxp3 in naïve
T cells deficient in CNS1 (16) suggesting a dominant role for
TGF-β signaling in extrathymic pTreg generation. It has also been
argued that tTregs and pTregs have different requirement for co￾stimulation. CTLA-4 has been shown to be upregulated on iTregs
induced with TGF-β and its role in tTreg generation is debated
(50, 51). In contrast, contribution of CD28 co-stimulation in tTreg
generation in the thymus is well documented. The CD28-deficient
mice show markedly lower number of Foxp3+ in thymus and the
periphery (52, 53). CD28 may regulate Treg generation though
alteration of avidity of T cell antigen-presenting cell (APC) inter￾action, promote IL-2 production or directly affect T cells signaling
and survival (53, 54). However, whether CD28 is indispensable for
pTreg generation has not been proven.
Besides these factors, pTreg generation in the periphery is
thought to require self-antigen encounter by Tconv and may
depend on encountering a specialized subset of APCs. As discussed
earlier, APCs such as lung resident macrophages are conditioned
by the local milieu and can develop the ability to induce pTreg
conversion (41). In this regard, dendritic cells (DCs) are known
to be highly tolerogenic in certain circumstances and their deple￾tion can lead to decreased Foxp3+ Tregs and increased effector
T cell responses, suggesting a major role for antigen presenta￾tion by DCs in maintaining/converting Tregs in the periphery
(55–57). Recent studies have led to the hypothesis that certain
DC subsets are better equipped at converting Tregs than others.
It was initially believed that antigen presentation by immature
DCs leads to pTreg cell conversion whereas mature DCs promote
effector function but more recent studies have questioned this
(57–59). Targeting of antigen to immature DCs via DEC205 or
antigen presentation by CD103-expressing DCs favor the induc￾tion of pTregs in vivo (10, 48, 60). A recent report showed that
migrating DCs are superior to tissue-resident DCs in their ability
to induce Foxp3 (61). In this study by targeting self-antigen to skin
migratory or lymphoid-resident DCs the investigators found that
skin langerin+ DCs have unique ability to promote generation
of pTregs in vivo. Moreover, there is evidence that plasmacytoid
DC subsets can also enhance induction of pTregs in mucosal sites
such as the lung (62). Hence, the combination of soluble factors
in the microenvironment, such as TGF-β and IL-2, and antigen
presentation by specialized APCs seems to be critical for pTreg
cell generation. This is particularly evident in the gut mucosa,
where pTregs are generated with precise antigen specificities and
characteristics. This results in a specialized pTreg subset, which is
important for controlling local inflammatory responses but differ
functionally from the tTregs that are generated to maintain gen￾eral immune homeostasis. In this regard, the specific contribution
of individual APC subsets to Treg induction in the thymus is not
completely understood. Although it has been shown that antigen

presentation by AIRE expressing medullary epithelial cells and
DCs are important in Treg differentiation, the pathways involved
are still poorly defined (63–65). Recently, the CD27-CD70 pathway
has been shown to be important in promoting Treg development
by DCs and medullary epithelial cells (66). CD70 expression on
medullary thymic epithelial cells and on DCs enhanced positive
selection of Tregs and promoted the survival of developing Tregs.
Of note, AIRE expressing extrathymic cells have been described
as regulating peripheral tolerance but whether this is mediated
through pTreg induction has not been addressed (67).
FUNCTION AND STABILITY OF pTREGS
It is well established that tTregs are crucial for preventing autoim￾munity and exaggerated immune responses. Thymectomy in mice
on day 3 after birth results in organ-specific autoimmune diseases
due to lack of Treg development, which can be prevented by inoc￾ulation of CD25+CD4+ Tregs (13, 14). These findings suggest
a limited role for pTregs in the absence of tTregs in controlling
autoimmune responses. However, studies aimed directly at ana￾lyzing pTregs function in vivo have been few, due to the lack of
appropriate animal models. Most functional studies have utilized
in vitro TGF-β-induced iTregs and have shown them to be pro￾tective (25, 68, 69). In this regard, TGF-β-induced antigen-specific
iTregs are highly efficient in controlling onset of autoimmunity in
murine model of autoimmune gastritis through inhibition of DC
functions and modulation of T cell trafficking (70, 71). However,
studies comparing suppressive functions of Treg subsets directly,
have found iTregs to be less efficient than tTregs (15, 19). These
studies likely reflect a lack of acquisition of the full Treg program by
TGF-β-induced iTregs, which in combination with other factors,
such as number of cells injected and type of animal model used,
may influence their efficacy. The functional analysis of pTregs has
mostly been limited to mucosal tolerance, inflammatory responses
to foreign antigens, and animal models that may not reflect phys￾iological conditions. Haribhai et al. showed recently that tTregs
were unable to suppress chronic inflammation and autoimmu￾nity in the absence of pTregs (15). In their model, tTregs alone
were not sufficient to maintain tolerance when transferred into
Foxp3-deficient mice. However, when Foxp3− Tconv cells were
co-injected with tTregs, peripherally generated pTregs represented
∼15% of Treg pool and acted in concert with tTregs to restore tol￾erance. It is difficult to draw full conclusion based on these studies
due to the reported inconsistencies in the behavior of effector T
cell responses in scurfy mice. Despite this, if similar functions of
pTregs were observed in other animal models, it would support
an interesting paradigm, that pTregs are generated to complement
tTregs and contributions by both pTregs and tTregs are neces￾sary to establish tolerance. We further hypothesize that tTregs are
required for immune homeostasis and broad-spectrum control of
autoimmune responses, whereas pTregs are generated to control
inflammation locally in tissues and this suppression may be tran￾sient due to the short lifespan/stability of pTregs (Figure 1). In this
regard, the Rudensky group has argued that pTregs have a limited
role in maintaining tolerance by showing that the absence of pTregs
does not result in spontaneous autoimmunity or exacerbation of
induced tissue-specific autoimmunity. They used CNS1−/− mice,
which have selective impairment in pTreg generation, and showed
FIGURE 1 | Model depicting the generation and function of tTregs and
pTregs. Nrp-1hi tTregs are generated in the thymus and are important in
maintaining immune homeostasis and controlling autoimmune responses.
During the course of an immune response, Nrp-1lo pTregs are generated in
response to Ag presentation by specialized APCs and control effector T cells
(Teff) at the site of inflammation. pTregs help in controlling inflammation
locally and may be more effective than tTregs at suppressing Teff due to
overlapping antigen specificity.
that CNS1−/− mice developed pronounced Th2-type pathologies
with hallmarks of allergic inflammation and asthma (16). This
was attributed to a lack of GATA-3-expressing Tregs in CNS1−/−
mice, in agreement with recent studies showing that Tregs can
specifically suppress immune responses driven by a given effec￾tor T cell subset (Th1, Th2, etc. . .) by expressing transcription
factors and chemokine receptors typically associated with this
subset. Although consistent expression of Foxp3 is required to
reinforce the regulatory program, Treg cells can also undergo
stimulus-specific differentiation that is regulated by transcription
factors typically associated with the differentiation of conven￾tional CD4+ T cells. This results in effector Tregs with unique
migratory and functional properties expressing transcription fac￾tors involved in regulation of the corresponding type of effector
immune responses. These “effector Tregs” have unique functional
properties and are better equipped to control ongoing immune
responses (72, 73). The first evidence of effector Tregs came from
findings showing that the expression of IFN regulatory factor
(IRF) 4, which is required for the differentiation of Th2 and Th17
cells, is required for the control of Th2-driven autoimmunity (74).
This concept has further been extended after subsequent studies
showing T-bet and STAT3 expression in Tregs control Treg migra￾tion and suppressive functions during Th1 and Th17 immune
responses, respectively (75, 76). Hence, in CNS1−/− mice, the
lack of GATA-3+ Tregs could be responsible for the exaggerated
Th2 response. This raises an interesting possibility that effector
Tregs are part of the pTreg pool, which allows them to be bet￾ter equipped with effector T cell machinery. This possibility has
not been addressed directly. One of the most prominent func￾tions of pTregs has been reported in the maintenance of fetal
tolerance during pregnancy. During pregnancy, pTregs are gen￾erated against a paternal alloantigen in a CNS1 dependent man￾ner and enforce maternal-fetal tolerance. CNS1 deficient females
exhibit increased embryo resorption accompanied by increased

immune cell infiltration during allogeneic but not syngeneic preg￾nancy, which are features observed in human preeclampsia (17).
A similar phenomenon has been observed in human pregnancy,
where Helios−Foxp3+ Tregs are increased in the peripheral blood
of healthy pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant
controls or preeclamptic patients (77). These results argue that
pTregs serve as the predominant subset in suppressing the fetal￾specific immune response and defect in pTregs may be central to
pathogenesis of preeclampsia (78, 79).
In our studies, we found that pTregs were efficient in con￾trolling the islet-specific autoimmune response in lympho-replete
conditions in NOD.CD28−/− mice, which have a greatly reduced
number of tTregs (30). In contrast, in lymphopenic conditions,
we found that Nrp-1hi tTregs were able to control EAE induced
by MBP-reactive T cells but Nrp-1lo pTregs were unable to exhibit
similar suppressive functions in vivo. These results suggest that
the functions of pTregs and tTregs are not overlapping and these
subsets may present specialized suppressive functions adapted
to individual immunological milieus and inflammatory settings.
Nrp-1 is a key protein with important functions in Tregs that
may provide Nrp-1-expressing tTregs a functional superiority over
pTregs. Indeed, Nrp-1 can enhance the interactions between Treg
cells and DCs and can directly promote the activation of the latent
form of TGF-β (80, 81). It remains to be explored whether reduced
expression of Nrp-1 on pTreg cells result in compromised sup￾pressive function under certain inflammatory conditions. In this
regard, it has been shown that Treg cells from Nrp-1−/− mice are
less suppressive than WT Treg cells and blocking of Nrp-1 abro￾gates suppression of proliferation of responder T cells by Treg
cells (81).
One of the striking differences we observed between two subsets
of Tregs was the stability of Foxp3 expression. Under lymphopenic
conditions, where IL-2 availability might be limited, a greater pro￾portion of pTregs lost Foxp3 compared to tTregs. This was also
evident when the MBP.TCR.Tg 1B3 mouse was crossed onto a
Treg lineage reporter system. 1B3.RAG−/− mice, which develop
Tregs only in the periphery, lack Tregs in the thymus. In order
to lineage track Tregs we crossed MBP.TCR.Tg 1B3 mouse onto
Foxp3.GFP.Cre.YFPfl/fl background (82), there was a significant
increase in the frequency of YFP+GFP− “exFoxp3 cells” compared
to WT or 1B3.RAG+/− mice (Figure 2). Decreased stability and
plasticity of Foxp3 expression in pTregs is perfectly in line with the
overall function of pTregs, i.e., to control ongoing inflammation
and then decline once immune responses are terminated (83–85).
The instability of Foxp3 expression in pTregs may allow these cells
to revert back to Tconv cells once the inflammation is cleared or
antigen presentation is reduced, helping them in responding to a
local inflammation without having a long-term suppressive out￾come. This notion was further supported in studies by Miyao et
al. showing that peripherally induced Foxp3+ T cells contain both
unstable and stable cells which show reduced stability compared
to tTregs in lymphopenic conditions (36). Thus, the growing evi￾dence suggests that while tTregs are central to immune homeostasis
and controlling autoimmunity, pTregs have specialized functions
depending on the type of inflammation while playing an indispen￾sible role in certain settings such as mucosal immunity and fetal
tolerance.

DIFFERENCES IN THE TCR REPERTOIRE OF pTREGS AND
tTREGS
It is now well accepted that TCR diversity plays a crucial role in
thymic selection and also differentiation of Tregs. During T cell
development in the thymus, an extremely diverse set of TCRs is
selected into the peripheral repertoire during a process in which
thymocytes with highly reactive TCRs that potentially see self￾antigens are eliminated while cells with intermediate affinity TCRs
are selected into Tregs. The Treg repertoire is highly diverse with
a wide range of antigen specificities but marked reactivity to self￾antigens, and very little overlap with the repertoire of Tconv cells
(86–88). Although the affinity of TCRs expressed by Tregs for self￾antigenic peptide/MHC complexes remains to be fully defined, it
is believed to be 100-fold lower than negatively selected TCRs.
Only a handful of studies have tried to address the shaping of the
TCR repertoire in pTregs compared to tTregs, partly because of
the paucity of an appropriate model to generate pTregs in vivo.
The “division of labor” concept for the pTreg and tTreg popu￾lations would suggest a limited clonal relationship between these
two subsets. In this regard, studies of TCR repertoire in Tregs from
the intestinal mucosa, which comprises mostly pTregs (discussed
in details later), have provided some useful insights (89). Indeed,
Tregs isolated from the gut express TCRs that appear different from

Yadav et al. Characterizing peripherally induced Tregs
those used by Tregs in other locations, implying that pTregs in the
gut have a distinct repertoire that may be shaped by interactions
with local antigens.
We took advantage of our ability to separate Tregs into
different subsets based on Nrp-1 expression to compare the
TCR repertoire of Nrp-1hi and Nrp-1lo Treg subsets using
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequencing. To
limit the overall diversity of the repertoire for this study, we
used MBP.TCR.Tg.Foxp3-GFP mice and isolated Nrp-1hi tTregs,
Nrp-1lo pTregs, and Tconv (CD4+Foxp3−) cells, then amplified,
cloned, and sequenced a region of the α chain encompassing the
CDR3 for Vα2
+ TCR. Although it was a limited analysis and
may not represent the whole repertoire, it still provided useful
information. Out of nearly 290 clones per subset, 175 pTregs, 212
tTregs, and 192 Tconv cells had productive V–J rearrangements.
CDR3 amino acid sequence analysis of Vα2 revealed that there
was limited overlap between the tTreg and pTreg CDR3 sequences
(Figure 3). The pTreg subset shared only 8 and 9.1% CDR3 amino
acid sequences with Tconv cells and tTregs, respectively. As shown
in Figure 3, the most frequent CDR3 sequences detected in tTreg
and Tconv cells were rarely used in pTregs. The limited overlap
between the pTreg and tTreg subsets was expected and is consis￾tent with other recent studies using peripherally generated pTregs
(15, 89) and again emphasized the different lineage development
of Nrp-1hi tTregs and Nrp-1lo pTregs. Interestingly, very few of the
TCRs sequences overlapped with Tconv TCRs as well suggesting
that the pTregs represent a very small, presumably self-antigen￾specific TCR subset within the large Tconv repertoire. This is
consistent with recent findings by others (89) and fit with the
notion that distinct TCR ligand affinity may dictate the genera￾tion of pTregs in the periphery. However, our analysis was limited
to a relatively small number of TCR sequences and a more thor￾ough repertoire analysis of Nrp-1hi and Nrp-1lo Tregs is needed
to further substantiate these findings.
Having distinct sets of TCRs in pTregs allows Tregs to have a
broader repertoire overall, which is important for recognition of a
wide array of potential self and foreign antigens and ensures that
Tregs can play their role in a large variety of immune responses.
Although it remains unclear if cells expressing certain TCRs are
more disposed to turn on Foxp3 in the periphery. It is well
known that TCR affinity required for tTreg development is higher
than that required for positive selection of Tconv cells and lower
than for negative selection. Interestingly, the lack of overlap in
the repertoire of pTregs and tTregs (Figure 3) suggests that the
TCRs of Tconv cells that turn on Foxp3 in the periphery evade
being selected on tTregs in the thymus. This indicates that anti￾gen encounter by a TCR has different outcome in the periphery
versus the thymus. One possibility that has been raised recently
is that antigenic peptides may bind in more than one register to
the MHCII and this may affect interactions with the TCR. Poor
binding, or binding in a different register, may prevent thymic
deletion and allow autoreactive T cells targeting self-antigens to
escape negative selection. For instance, a segment from the insulin
beta chain (B:9–23), which is a major target of autoreactive CD4+
T cells in humans and NOD mice (90), can bind the groove of
NOD MHC I-Ag7 molecules in at least three overlapping adjacent

registers. Most B:9–23 specific CD4+ T cells in the periphery rec￾ognize peptides bound in an unusual and not predicted register
due to the poor affinity for MHC class II binding (91–95). These
unique registers of insulin peptides may be generated by process￾ing of insulin and peptide loading into I-Ag7 molecules that occur
specifically in the pancreas and are distinct from the classical APCs
(94, 96). Thus, the fact that functional peripheral registers display
weak binding to I-Ag7 molecules and/or are generated exclusively
in the periphery may explain how T cells specific for these peptides
can escape thymic negative selection in NOD mice. In the periph￾ery, uptake and processing of tissue-derived proteins and peptides
by a different type of APCs could give rise to peptide-MHC com￾plexes in a distinct register, which are not found in the thymus
and could result in high affinity interactions with the TCR that
trigger the activation of T cells. Such interactions have been show
to turn on Foxp3 in naïve T cells in the periphery and participate
in induction of peripheral tolerance (97). Thus, presentation of
antigen differently in the periphery for Foxp3 induction could be
one of the ways by which a broader TCR repertoire in the Treg
pool is achieved.
ROLE OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA IN INDUCING pTREGS
Several studies have shown that the frequency of Foxp3+ Tregs
among CD4+ T cells is notably higher, due to peripheral con￾version, in mucosal surfaces than in other tissues (48, 49, 60). In
humans, >100 trillion bacteria, which represent over 100 differ￾ent species, colonize the skin and mucosal surfaces, including the
oral cavity and the intestine. This leads to a complex ecosystem
with continuous interplay between host cells and the microbiota.
Many studies have shown that the intestinal mucosa is a preferen￾tial site for the peripheral induction of Tregs, suggesting that the
high frequency of mucosal Tregs may be due to this locally supe￾rior conversion into pTregs. Consistent with this hypothesis, the
frequency of Nrp-1loFoxp3+ Tregs is increased in the colonic lam￾ina propria. Another non-exclusive possibility is that the increased
frequency of pTregs in the presence of commensal bacteria in the
gut microenvironment is partly due to selective survival of Nrp￾1
lo pTregs. Interestingly, colonic Treg numbers are greatly reduced
in germ-free mice, suggesting the dependence of gut Tregs on the
commensal microbiota (98–100). However, the exact mechanisms
by which Tregs are generated in response to self-antigens or for￾eign antigens derived from commensal bacteria remain unclear.
Bacterial metallo-matrix proteases could potentially contribute to
the conversion of TGF-β to its active form and thus participate in
induction of pTregs in the gut (101). There is a growing amount
of literature suggesting that the development of T cell subsets,
including Tregs, is influenced by a single species of microbe in the
gut (101–104). Indeed, colonization by the bacterium Clostrid￾ium, or Bacillus fragilis, leads to induction of Foxp3 expression
in Tconv cells (101). The Clostridium species is indigenous and
provides a TGF-β-rich environment that may facilitate the induc￾tion of Foxp3 in colon. While B. fragilis is a human commensal,
it could increase the frequency of colonic Tregs when it colonized
the mouse gut by means of a protease-resistant capsular polysac￾charide. Polysaccharide A from B. fragilis can also act directly on
Tregs through TLR2 (104). Although this field is still in its early
stages, these findings may result in development of novel ways
of inducing tolerance through colonization of a single species in
the gut, which could be useful in inflammatory bowel disease or
other indications requiring the generation of pTregs. The induc￾tion of Tregs in the gut is also influenced by the presence of APCs
specialized in picking up bacterial products and presenting them
to T cells. CD103-expressing DCs are present in abundance in
the gut and are specialized in inducing Treg differentiation from
naïve CD4+ T cells (48, 60). These migratory DCs are responsible
for picking up bacterial pathogens from the intestinal epithelium
and transporting them to the lymph nodes to present antigens to T
cells (105, 106). In addition,CD11b+ lamina propria macrophages
express retinoic acid dehydrogenase and are able to induce the dif￾ferentiation of Tregs in the intestine (107). Thus, gut microbes can
initiate the generation of pTregs in the gut in many different ways.
IMPORTANCE OF SEPARATING SUBSETS OF TREGS IN
HUMANS
We have learned a great deal about the functions of Foxp3+ Tregs
through studies of murine Tregs. However, in light of current and
future clinical applications of Tregs, it is imperative to define the
subsets of human Tregs and how they relate to mouse Tregs. The
extent to which pTregs are represented in the peripheral pool in
humans is controversial, and differences observed between Tregs
in humans and mice could hamper our ability to translate find￾ings on murine pTregs to pTregs in humans. For example, a vast
majority of circulating human Tregs express CD31, a marker for
recent thymic emigrants, thus suggesting their thymic origin (108).
However, when we analyzed in humans the expression of Nrp-1, a
marker for murine circulating tTregs as discussed above, we could
not detect Nrp-1 expression on human Tregs in the peripheral
blood whereas greater than 70% of circulating Tregs express Nrp￾1 in mice. This is consistent with earlier reports with exception of
one study in which Nrp-1+ Tregs were detected in human lym￾phoid organs (109, 110). We also analyzed healthy human splenic
Tregs and found little or no expression of Nrp-1 on Foxp3+
cells (unpublished observations). Another significant difference
between human and mouse T cells is that human Tconv cells can
express Foxp3 upon transient activation more readily than mouse
cells (111–113). Whether Foxp3 expression in activated cells is
(111, 114) or is not (115–117) associated with acquisition of sup￾pressor function remains controversial. However, because human
T cells can express Foxp3 upon activation even in the absence of
TGF-β (118), it makes it harder to distinguish activated T cells
from pTregs even though Foxp3+ activated T cells do not exhibit
any of the canonical markers of human Tregs.
Among other markers found on mouse Tregs, Helios expres￾sion has correlated very well in humans Tregs. Like mouse,
Helios is expressed highly on human Tregs with greater than
70% of Foxp3+ Tregs expressing Helios in the peripheral blood.
Although the Helios−Foxp3+ Tregs fit the profile of pTregs,
whether these cells originate outside thymus remains controver￾sial. Among other evidences, effector cytokine secretion, which
has been proposed to be a function of pTregs, has been associ￾ated with Helios−Foxp3+ Tregs (119, 120). Conversely, a recent
study made the argument that both Helios− and Helios+ Tregs
are of thymic origin by showing that both Helios− and Helios+
Tregs exhibit a demethylated TSDR and express canonical Treg
www.frontiersin.org August 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 232 | 7

Yadav et al. Characterizing peripherally induced Tregs
markers such as CD39 and CTLA-4 in human peripheral blood
(121). However, Helios− Tregs were gated on the CD45RA+ naïve
Treg population in that study and may not include the whole
Helios−Foxp3+ T cell population. In addition, studies in mice
have shown that pTregs are very similar to tTregs in terms of
TSDR demethylation and expression of Treg canonical markers,
raising the possibility that these parameters may not adequately
discriminate the pTreg and tTreg subsets in humans as well. It
has also been argued elsewhere that Helios can be expressed in
conventional human T cells upon activation (28). In this regard,
Nrp-1 expression is upregulated in iTregs in mice and pTregs
can also upregulate Nrp-1 expression during inflammation in
tissues suggesting similar upregulation of Helios could be hap￾pening on human T cells. Hence, despite the controversies Helios
remains the best marker to separate tTregs from the peripherally
generated pTregs in the human peripheral blood. In our labora￾tory, we recently identified a subset of Foxp3+ Tregs in humans
that also expressed IFN-γ. Despite high levels of Foxp3, these
IFN-γ
+Foxp3+ cells lack Helios expression and show a partially
methylated TSDR in the Foxp3 locus, and therefore fit the profile
of peripherally generated Tregs. Moreover, since Helios is selec￾tively expressed on IFN-γ
− Tregs (119), ongoing studies in our
laboratory aimed at characterizing these cells may facilitate the
identification of a putative surface marker for Helios-expressing
Tregs that will more reliably separate tTregs from other pTreg
subsets.
Lastly, understanding Treg subsets in humans is also important
because Treg dysfunctions have been reported in several human
autoimmune diseases (119, 122–125). We learned from mouse
studies that pTregs are less stable than tTregs and may have com￾promised functions in certain inflammatory conditions, notably
in the autoimmune setting.Whether a similar defect in pTreg pop￾ulation leads to Treg dysfunction in autoimmune patients remains
to be seen. It would be possible to address these issues once
the markers for human pTregs are defined. This may also have
important repercussions on immunotherapies designed to restore
Treg-mediated tolerance in diseases where targeting tissues are not
readily accessible for functional studies, such as type 1 diabetes or
multiple sclerosis. Using mouse models that mimic the human
immune system may also help approach some of these questions.
In this regard, humanized mice generated using cord blood or
transplantation of human thymus and bone marrow cells could
prove useful and may help resolve some of these issues.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Ever since the discovery of CD25 and Foxp3 as markers of regula￾tory T cells, there has been some controversy in the field regarding
the existence and development of pTregs. New technologies in gene
profiling, cell sorting, and mouse engineering have made it clear
that pTregs develop under normal homeostasis as well as under
inflammatory conditions. Identification of genes that are differen￾tially expressed between Treg subsets and mouse models of pTreg
generation have helped in differentiating characteristics of pTregs
from tTregs. Functionally, the role of pTregs in mucosal tolerance is
already pretty well established, and it is now becoming increasingly
evident that these Tregs have specialized functions in response to
non self-antigens during conditions such as asthma and fetal tol￾erance. However, a number of key questions still remain. What are
molecular determinants that contribute to the induction of Foxp3
in the periphery? Is Foxp3 induction in the periphery restricted
to a subset of Treg precursors? How does TCR affinity or strength
of signal influence Treg generation in the thymus versus periph￾ery? What are the different conditions under which pTregs play an
indispensable role? Finally, how can we utilize pTregs to improve
Treg therapy in human conditions? The definition of new mark￾ers to complement Nrp-1 and Helios and new mouse models and
humanized mouse models of pTreg generation will undoubtedly
play a part in answering some of these questions in the very near
future. A better understanding of the biology of pTregs will in
turn provide a clearer view of the respective role of pTregs versus
tTregs in a number of human pathologies and will be important
in devising optimal therapeutic strategies as Tregs are increasingly
being considered as either tools or targets of immunotherapy in
many diseases.
