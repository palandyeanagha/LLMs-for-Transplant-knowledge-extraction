Background and Aim: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious complication of decompensated liver 
cirrhosis, affecting the prognosis of patients underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunts (TIPS). We aim to create a nomogram to predict hepatic encephalopathy- free survivals (HEFS) 
after TIPS in cirrhotic patients and select appropriate candidates for TIPS. Methods: Cirrhotic patients 
underwent TIPS from 2015 to 2018 in our department were included. Multivariable Cox regression 
was conducted to estimate the predictors of overt HE (OHE) after TIPS within one year. A nomogram 
based on the Cox proportional hazard model using data from a retrospective training cohort (70% of 
the patients) was developed. Then the prediction model was validated in the remaining 30% patients 
by Harrell’s C-indexes, ROC curves and calibration plots. Results: Of 373 patients, 117 developed 
postoperative OHE (31.4%). The training and validation groups comprised 83 (31.4%) and 34 (31.2%) 
patients, respectively. The cumulative survival rates of patients with HE at 1, 2 and 3 years were 90%, 
83% and 76%, respectively.The nomogram included the following variables: age, Child-Turcotte-Pugh 
class (CTP class), diabetes mellitus (DM), serum creatinine and serum sodium (C-index = 0.772). The 
C-index for HEFS prediction was 0.773 for the validation cohort. The ROC for predicting HEFS was 0.809 
and 0.783, respectively. Conclusions: We created a nomogram of predicting postoperative HEFS in 
cirrhotic patients received TIPS. This nomogram could be an important tool of HE risk prediction before 
TIPS to guide the therapeutic strategy in cirrhotic patients.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), has been widely used to treat portal hypertension related 
complications, including refractory ascites and esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding. However, postoperative 
complications, in particular hepatic encephalopathy (HE) after TIPS, remain a major setback, which seriously 
affects the prognosis of cirrhotic patients and significantly increases the risk of mortality1,2
. Previous study sug￾gests that the incidence of HE after TIPS using covered stents was not increased compared with that of bare stents, 
but the 1-year postoperative incidence of HE is still up to 35%3
.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of serious complications in the progression of liver disease, increas￾ing rates of readmission and mortality. Ammonia intoxication hypothesis is one of the principal pathogenesis 
of hepatic encephalopathy4
. According to the EASL/AASLD guidelines, HE can be classified as covert hepatic 
encephalopathy (CHE) and overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE)5
. HE occurs as a complication, affecting up to 
20% of decompensated cirrhotic patients. The patients submitted to TIPS are particularly prompt to develop HE, 
increasing to 10–50%6
.
Previous studies have reported that several factors including older age, diabetes mellitus, higher MELD 
score, previous HE7
, the stent diameter and proton pump inhibitors treatment8
 were related to the high risk of

developing HE. A meta-analysis9
 suggested that advanced age, Child-Pugh score and history of HE were pre￾dictors of post-TIPS HE in patients with portal hypertension (especially non-alcoholic cirrhosis). In particular, 
Yousif et al.
10 suggested that lower 25(OH) D level increased the incidence of HE and SBP in cirrhotic patients. 
But it remains difficult to identify patients at risk. Therefore, it is necessary to build a prediction model that can 
forecast risk of post-TIPS HE in patients with cirrhosis.
The nomogram is recognized as a reliable tool for constructing an intuitive statistical predictive model to 
quantify the risk of a clinical event11. Each variable included in the nomogram is assigned a value based on its 
prognostic significance. The aim of our study was to create a prediction nomogram model of OHE in cirrhotic 
patients treated by TIPS due to esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding (EGVB).
Results
Patients characteristics. Among 413 cirrhotic patients treated by TIPS for EGVB from January 2015 to 
December 2018 at our center, forty of the patients were excluded for serious data loss (35) and age under 18 
or over 85 (5). Among 373 patients enrolled, 264 patients (70%) were included in the training cohort, and 109 
patients (30%) were included in the validation cohort, as shown in Fig. 1. Descriptive characteristics for the over￾all population are listed in Table 1 and Supplement Table 2. The median follow-up was 37 months (1-60 months). 
Of all 373 patients, a total of 117 (31.4%) had post-TIPS HE during the follow-up period, and 103 (27.6%) had 
HE within 12 months. During one year of follow-up, 31.4% (83/264) of the patients in the development cohort 
and 31.2% (34/109) in the validation cohort had developed overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) after TIPS. At 
the end of follow-up, a total of 68 (18.2%) patients died. The cumulative survival rates of patients with HE at 1, 2 
and 3 years were 90%, 83% and 76%, respectively. From Supplement Table 1, we can find that gender, pro-TIPS 
HE, etiology of liver cirrhosis, total bilirubin and technical data of TIPS procedure were comparable between HE 
and Non-HE group (P>0.05). Diabetic patients developed more HE comparing to non-diabetic patients (32.5% 
VS 16.0%; P  =0.002). In terms of liver function damage, the mean baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 
HE group was higher compared to that of Non- HE group. The incidence of OHE also increased with increasing 
age and serum creatinine. Comparing with Non-HE group, serum sodium level in HE group was significantly 
lower (p<0.05).
Identification of prognostic factors for 1-yr post-TIPS HE. Further, we confirm independent prog￾nostic factors for post-TIPS HE by using multivariate regression methods. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred 
in 26.5% of patients within one year in training cohort. Table 2 displays the univariate and multivariable 
Cox regression including clinical and laboratory data. We used Cox regression analysis to test 1 year hepatic 
encephaloapthy-free survival (HEFS) rates after TIPS implantation. Finally, multivariate analysis indicated that 
age, together with DM, CTP class, serum creatinine and cerum sodium were independent risk factors for hepatic 
encephalopathy(P<0.05). Table 3 shows the factors contributing to the final model to predict the risk of develop￾ing OHE. The cumulative survival rate of remaining free of HE was 73.4% within 1 year.
Derivation of the prognostic nomogram. Nomogram-derived probabilities of 1-yr hepatic 
encephalopathy- free survivals (HEFS) after TIPS were plotted. The c-index of nomograms for prediction of 
HEFS were 0.772 and 0.773 in the training and validation cohort. The nomogram and calibration curves are 
plotted as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This model contains five variables, which located on each variable axis. We can 
get the point received for the value of each variable by draw a line up to point axis, and the sum of these points 
corresponds to the total point axis. Finally, we can determine the likelihood for each individual of 1-yr HEFS by 
drawing a line downward to the survival axes.

Validation of the prognostic nomogram. Five prognostic factors were retained in the final model 
(Fig. 2). The C-index and AUC for the training cohort is 0.772 and 0.809, respectively, which prove that the 
accuracy and reliability of this nomogram model are relatively high. Calibration and ROC curves were plotted to 
evaluate the prediction effect of the nomogram (Fig. 3). The prognostic ability of the model was acceptable with 
a C-index of 0.773 and AUC of 0.783 in validation cohort. The calibration curve also shows that there is only a 
limited deviation from the ideal prediction model (Fig. 3a,c).
Discussion
The present study is the first time to establish a nomogram to predict the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) 
after TIPS procedure. Risk factors contributing to the model included age, DM, CTP class, serum sodium and 
serum creatinine. HE has attracted increasing attention as one of the common complications after TIPS, which 
is an important risk factor influencing the prognosis of cirrhotic patients and increasing the rate of death12. In 
our study, a total of 68 (18.2%) patients died. The cumulative survival rates of patients with HE at 1, 2 and 3 years 
were 90%, 83% and 76%, respectively. For early HE after TIPS, recent studies have shown that recurrence of OHE 
is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with cirrhosis who undergo TIPS13. However, some 
researchers believe that there is no significant correlation between HE and the long-term prognosis of patients14. 
At present, the relationship between HE after TIPS and the long-term survival of patients is still controversial. In 
our study, we found that the long-term survival of patients with HE after TIPS surgery was poorer than that of 
patients without HE (3-year survival: 76% vs 90%). Some symptoms of HE are irreversible and have an impact on 
the long-term quality of life. For high-risk patients, awareness of HE should be raised, and treatment measures 
should be actively adopted. In our study we saw that 31.4% of patients developed hepatic encephalopathy after 
TIPS placement, which is agreement with previous observations (10–50%)6
. Cumulative risk of hepatic enceph￾alopathy within one year after TIPS is about 26.6%. Given that only overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) was 
considered in our study, the whole incidence of HE is lower than that in other studies15. Minimal hepatic enceph￾alopathy (MHE) is highly prevalent. Previous studies8,16 have reported that about 40% of hospitalized cirrhotic 
patients have MHE, which may be higher in the disease progression stage.
In our study, the independent predictors for HE incidence were age, CTP class, diabetes mellitus, serum 
sodium and creatinine after multivariate analyses. Patients with lower serum sodium and higher Child-Pugh 
score before TIPS might be more probably attacked by early post-TIPS HE which indicated worse long-term

survival. Previous studies demonstrated that hyponatremia could affect brain metabolism and increase the risk 
of hepatic encephalopathy17–20. Hyponatremia could worsen the neurological symptoms, which is correlated with 
the change of osmolality pressure and sodium concentration in the extracellular fluid. The International Society 
for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN)21 points out that hyponatremia should be pre￾vented as far as possible, avoiding exacerbating the progression of HE. Serum creatinine was also independently 
associated with HE in cirrhotic patients after TIPS. Renal function including serum creatinine and urea nitrogen 
involved in in ammonia metabolism, is related to cognitive impairment in cirrhosis22.
In addition to CTP class, MELD or MELD-Na score are now widely used to evaluate liver function for the 
end-stage liver disease and predict mortality of liver failure before or after operation. Serum sodium and creati￾nine are important parts of MELD-Na score. In this study, serum sodium and creatinine had a strong effect on the 
OHE rate. HE is an important feature of liver failure, which prompts poor prognosis. This is consistent with our 
research that patients with higher CTP score (hazard ratio: 1.307, 95% CI: 1.088–1.569; P=0.004) are particularly 
prompt to develop HE. With the increase of child-pugh class, the survival rate of patients without hepatic enceph￾alopathy in 1 year decreased significantly.

In addition, DM was connected with developing post-TIPS OHE, which was confirmed in various studies23–25. 
In our study, we only talked about type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), “which was diagnosed based” on the 1999 
World Health Organization criteria26. Systemic inflammatory and high protein catabolism and ammonia pro￾duction may be a potential mechanism. Increased glutaminase activity of liver, kidney and small intestine is also 
involved in hyperammonemia. In addition, constipation is more common in elderly diabetic patients owing to a 
prolonged duodenum cecal transit time. Age is also proven to be associated with an increase of HE-related mor￾tality. Aging brain appears to be more responsive to the toxic metabolite including plasma ammonia. And besides, 
with the increase of age, intestinal empting is prolonged, and constipation and intestinal flora imbalance are more 
likely occur. All of these are associated with the onset of HE.
On one hand our study identified these risk factors associated with hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS place￾ment. Furthermore, these risk factors are further quantified and presented in the form of nomogram, which is 
beneficial to clinical practice. Nomogram is a simple and advanced statistical method. One of the advantages 
of nomograms is that they can be used to assess individual risks based on patient characteristics and disease 
characteristics. Nomograms have previously been used to predict survival outcomes for patients with various

cancer-related diseases27–29. The development of tools that predict the prognosis of each patient may be helpful in 
directing individualized therapy. Malinchoc et al. established a nomogram for predicting 3-month mortality after 
TIPS in 200030. In this paper, the nomogram scoring system for predicting hepatic encephalopathy- free survival 
within one year after TIPS has a good survival prediction effect(C-index = 0.772, ROC=0.809), providing an 
alternative visual risk prediction chart for the clinic.
The nomograms validated in this study may not be suitable for all patients, but the establishment of a clinical 
prediction model based on the risk of HE after TIPS would rather serve to heighten awareness of the possibility of 
post-TIPS HE and make timely adjustments to individualized treatment schemes. According to the risk factors of 
HE shown in the nomogram model, more targeted prevention and treatment strategies should be implemented, 
for example, enhancing the awareness of early HE screening for elderly and diabetic patients and strengthening 
blood sugar management. In the clinical treatment process, comprehensive treatment methods should be adopted 
to improve various indexes in CTP scoring standards, reduce CTP scoring and grading before TIPS, and thus 
reduce the incidence of HE after TIPS. For patients with higher risks of HE occurrence, active prevention and 
treatment after TIPS, such as lactulose and rifaximin therapy, may achieve better quality of life and long-term 
survival31.
However, some limitations remain to be concerned in the present study. First, our retrospective study is from 
single center, so more prospective multicenter studies in the future may help to further improve the prediction 
ability of the model. It will be better to validate the model with data from another institution. Second, in this 
study, we concerned only on overt hepatic encephalopathy and data on mild encephalopathy or covert hepatic 
encephalopathy are lacking. In spite of these drawbacks, this study firstly builds a nomogram of predicting 
post-TIPS HE in cirrhotic patients.
In conclusion, our study develops a prediction nomogram of 1-yr HEFS in cirrhotic patients who underwent 
TIPS for EGVB. Much work remains to do to refine the nomogram and to evaluate any other factors related to the 
developments of hepatic encephalopathy.
Methods
Participants. Patients diagnosed with cirrhosis and successfully underwent TIPS implantation for EGVB 
from January 2015 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. Patients under the age of 18 or above 80, with 
any neurological disease and severe data loss were excluded. Cirrhosis was diagnosed by a combination of clinic 
features, laboratory findings, imaging evidence and endoscopy and conformed by liver biopsy as necessary. They 
were randomized into two groups using R Studio version. About 70% (264 of 373 patients) of the patients were 
selected as the model group to establish a prediction model, and the remaining 30% (109 of 373 patients) were 
used as the validation group to test the model (Fig. 1).
The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. All patients signed written informed 
consent for every procedure.
Data collection. Preoperative data were collected, including relevant examinations results within 7 days 
prior to TIPS. Complete blood count, kidney function test, serum electrolyte, plasma ammonia level, liver func￾tion test, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, abdominal ultrasonic Doppler and previous history 
were recorded in all patients. Additionally, the history of preoperative hepatic encephalopathy were reviewed and 
verified by more than two experienced liver specialists according to West‐Haven criteria.
TIPS procedure. TIPS implantation technique has been described previously32. In brief, the procedure is 
performed via the jugular vein. A catheter was placed through the jugular vein to the inferior vena cava or hepatic 
vein. A balloon (Fluency; Bard) was used to dilate the intrahepatic parenchymal tract. During procedure, covered 
stents (Fluency; Bard, New Jersey, USA) or bare stents ((Luminexx; Bard, New Jersey, USA) or a composite stent 
of covered and bare metal stent was inserted in the channel, which were dilated to full nominal diameter. Portal 
vein pressure was measured before and after the stent placement. Besides, tissue glue and some coils (Cook, 
Bloomington, Indiana, USA) were used to embolize the prominent gastric varices observed during TIPS. Direct 
portography was then performed to assess the patency of portal venous system.
Evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. All patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12months after TIPS, 
and then subsequent follow-up performed once a year through observation of clinical symptoms. Investigations 
including blood ammonia levels, transaminase and ultrasound were performed as necessary. The mental state of 
the patients was assessed at each follow-up. Hepatic encephalopathy was diagnosed according to the West‐Haven 
criteria5
 and the feature of overt HE episodes (>=grade 2 according to West-Haven scoring) were record. The 
patients and their families were trained to contact the doctors if any mental symptoms appeared, including men￾tal and behavior changes. Besides, hepatology nurses in our department keep in regular contact with the patients 
and their families after TIPS insertion.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, USA). For continuous varia￾bles, t-test was used. Categorical variables were compared with the F test. A multivariate regression analysis was 
conducted to determine statistically risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy, calculating the relative ratios and 
95% CI of independent prognostic factors. The significance level was established as 0.05. Nomogram was per￾formed using the “rms” and “survival” packages in R 3.2.5 software (http://www.r-project.org). Calibration curves 
with average K–M estimates were then plotted to evaluate the performance of nomogram. Bootstrap method was 
used for model validation. We performed receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) curve using “pROC” package 
to explore the predictive efficiency of nomogram model.
