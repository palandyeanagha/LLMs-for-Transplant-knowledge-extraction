Abstract
Background and Aims: Treatment of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC-B
HCC) is controversial. This study compared the long-term survival of patients with BCLC-B HCC who received liver resection
(LR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).
Methods: A total of 257 and 135 BCLC-B HCC patients undergoing LR and TACE, respectively, were retrospectively
evaluated. Kaplan–Meier method was used for long-term survival analysis. Independent prognostic predictors were
determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: The hospital mortality rate was similar between groups (3.1% vs. 3.7%; P = 0.76). However, the LR group showed a
significantly higher postoperative complication rate than the TACE group (28 vs. 18.5%; P = 0.04). At the same time, the LR
group showed significantly higher overall survival rates (1 year, 84 vs. 69%; 3 years, 59 vs. 29%; 5 years, 37 vs. 14%; P,0.001).
Moreover, similar results were observed in the propensity score model. Three independent prognostic factors were
associated with worse overall survival: serum AFP level ($400 ng/ml), serum ALT level, and TACE.
Conclusions: LR appears to be as safe as TACE for patients with BCLC-B HCC, and it provides better long-term overall
survival. However, prospective studies are needed to disclose if LR may be regarded as the preferred treatment for these
patients as long as liver function is preserved.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with poor
prognosis and its incidence is increasing in many countries [1,2].
Our understanding of HCC pathogenesis and progression has
advanced, and so have diagnostic methods, surgical techniques,
and perioperative care. However, the prognosis of HCC patients
remains discouraging because of the high postoperative recurrence
rate and high cancer mortality. Identifying the optimal therapy for
HCC patients is therefore important for maximizing their long￾term survival.
Treatment outcomes for HCC patients are affected by multiple
variables, including tumor burden, the Child-Pugh score of liver
function reserve and the performance status of the patient [3].
Several staging systems have been described for HCC, including
the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification [4] and
Okuda [5], CLIP [6], and French [7] scores. Only the BCLC
staging system takes into account the above three variables. It links
staging with treatment indications and prognostic information,
such as estimated life expectancy [8]. Studies have validated and
proposed the clinical usefulness of this staging system [4,9], making
it one of the most reliable for HCC.
The BCLC intermediate stage, or stage B (BCLC-B), includes
Child-Pugh A and B patients with large, single-focus HCC
(.5 cm) and patients with multifocal HCC, defined as .3 tumors
of any size, or 2–3 tumors with a maximal diameter .3 cm. To be
categorized as BCLC-B, patients should be asymptomatic and
have no vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. The BCLC
classification indicates that these patients are optimal candidates
for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [4]. A systematic
review of randomized clinical trials showed that TACE provided
better 2-year survival than supportive treatment [10]. However, it
is unclear whether TACE provides any long-term survival benefits.
In addition, TACE has several potential disadvantages. Since the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68193

BCLC-B stage includes patients varying widely in tumor stage,
hepatic function (Child-Pugh A or B) and disease etiology [11,12],
TACE may not be the optimal therapy for all of them. The
technique also requires certain equipment and skills that may be
lacking in some countries, or it may not be the first choice of
physicians because of local surgical priorities and practices [13].
Liver resection (LR) is a simpler and less expensive alternative to
TACE that may be more suitable for some HCC patients. Studies
in North America, Europe and Asia concur that LR can be safely
performed in patients with large or multinodular HCC who have
good liver function [14,15,16,17,18]. The 5-year survival rate has
been reported to be about 37% [14]. However, the indication of
liver resection (LR) for BCLC-B HCC remains controversial and
should be assessed in more studies [11]. It may be that BCLC
selection criteria for LR are too restrictive, and that LR is a safe
and effective therapy for a larger proportion of HCC patients. The
aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic value of LR and
compare it with TACE for treating BCLC-B HCC patients in
southern China.
Patients and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the institutional review board of
Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. Written consent
was given by the patients for their information to be stored in the
hospital database and used for research.
Patients
Retrospective analysis was carried out on medical records of
patients diagnosed with HCC who were included in a prospective
database of the Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University
from January 2000 to November 2007. Patients who received their
initial HCC treatment at other centers were excluded. We
excluded patients who received only local ablation therapy,
systematic chemotherapy, sorafenib therapy or supportive care.
Patients in whom a malignancy other than HCC had been
diagnosed within a 5-year period before the initial HCC treatment
were also excluded. The remaining patients were treated with
either LR or TACE.
HCC diagnosis was confirmed after LR by histopathological
examination of surgical samples in all patients. HCC diagnosis
was confirmed in TACE patients by needle biopsy or by
analysis of two images [ultrasonography, computed tomography
(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging] in conjunction with a
serum level of a-fetoprotein (AFP) higher than 400 ng/mL.
Needle biopsy was performed in patients whose diagnosis based
on imaging and AFP level was uncertain. Tumor status was
assessed using various imaging techniques, including ultrasonog￾raphy, CT scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or
hepatic angiography.
Propensity Score Analysis
In order to reduce the bias in patient selection, a propensity
score analysis was developed to investigate causal relationships
between treatments and outcomes in a retrospective study other
than a randomized controlled trial [19]. Clinical variables
entered in the propensity model were age, gender, tumor size,
tumor number, serum bilirubin, ALT, albumin, and AFP.
Subsequently, a one-to-one match between the LR and TACE
groups was obtained by using the nearest-neighbor matching
method [20].
Liver Resection
Only Child-Pugh A patients with BCLC-B disease were
included in the current analysis. Indications for surgery were lack
of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypersplenism, as well as
the presence of appropriate residual liver volume, as determined
by volumetric computed tomography [21]. Partial hepatectomy
was performed following the techniques described by Zhou and
coworkers [22]. The surgery started with a bilateral subcostal
incision or L-shaped laparotomy with or without an upward
midline extension. Intraoperative ultrasound was routinely
performed to determine tumor location and assess the vascular
anatomy of the liver. To minimize perioperative blood loss,
Pringle’s maneuver was carried out intermittently, each time for
less than 20 minutes, with a clamp-free interval of 5 min. The
resection margin was more than 1 cm. Adequate drainage was
monitored.
TACE Procedure
Indications for using TACE for BCLC-B HCC patients were
lack of ascites and main portal vein tumor thrombus, and presence
of Child-Pugh A liver function. With the patient under local
anesthesia, a 4F-to-5F French catheter was introduced into the
abdominal aorta via the superficial femoral artery using the
Seldinger technique. Hepatic arterial angiography was performed
using fluoroscopy to guide the catheter into the celiac and superior
mesenteric artery. Then the feeding arteries, tumor stain, and
vascular anatomy surrounding the tumor were identified. A
microcatheter was introduced through the catheter and directed to
the feeding arteries. An emulsion of 5–15 ml lipiodol (Andre
Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/
m2
) with or without adriamycin (30 mg/m2
) was infused into the
feeding arteries until blood flow had nearly stopped. A follow-up
CT scan was arranged one month later to evaluate the effect of
TACE. The course was repeated once every 1–2 months for 2–6
cycles.
The default treatment for patients was liver resection; patients
were given TACE only upon request.
Patient Follow-up
After surgery or TACE, all patients underwent regular follow￾up involving a liver function test, measurement of serum AFP
levels, abdominal ultrasonography, and chest radiography at an
interval of 2–3 months in the first postoperative year and every 6
months in subsequent years. When intrahepatic recurrence was
suspected, further investigation was carried out using CT and/or
hepatic angiography. Chest CT or bone scans were conducted
when distant metastasis was suspected. Biopsies were performed
when necessary. Diagnoses of tumor recurrence and distant
metastasis were based on cytohistology, or on the non-invasive
diagnostic criteria for HCC used by the European Association for
the Study of the Liver [23].
All recurrences and metastasis were evaluated for new
treatment. Patients with recurrence were treated by hepatectomy,
radiofrequency ablation therapy, microwave coagulation therapy,
TACE, systemic chemotherapy, or sorafenib therapy. Therapy
was decided based on extrahepatic disease, hepatic function,
general health, and economic conditions.
Study Endpoint
The primary endpoint of the study was survival time after LR
and TACE. The survival time was defined as the time between the
date of surgery or TACE and the date of death. Patients who were
alive at the end of follow-up were censored.

Statistical Analysis
Prior to this study, all demographic and clinicopathological data
had been prospectively collected in a computer database.
Differences between categorical data were analyzed using the
chi-square test. Continuous data were expressed as mean 6 SD.
Differences between continuous data were analyzed using the t
test. Survival analysis was calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method
and group results were compared using the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis to identify independent prognostic factors
was carried out using the Cox proportional hazards model to
calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
(version 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA). For all tests, a P value ,0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population
During the study period, 2,758 consecutive southern Chinese
patients with HCC were enrolled in the database. Of these, 913
(33.1%) were excluded because they had received their initial
HCC treatment at other centers. Among the remaining 1,845
patients with complete survival data, 464 (25.1%) had BCLC-B
disease without extrahepatic metastasis. Of these, we excluded 57
patients (12.3%) who received only local ablation therapy,
systematic chemotherapy, sorafenib therapy or supportive care.
Another 15 patients (3.2%) were excluded because they had been
diagnosed with a malignancy other than HCC within a 5-year
period before receiving initial HCC treatment. The remaining 392
patients (84.5%) were enrolled in the study.
Of these patients, 257 (65.6%) received LR and 135 (34.4%)
received TACE. HCC diagnosis was confirmed after LR by
histopathological examination of surgical samples. HCC diagnosis
was confirmed in TACE patients by needle biopsy (11.6%) or
using two imaging techniques in conjunction with a serum level of
a-fetoprotein (AFP) higher than 400 ng/mL (88.4%). Needle
biopsy was performed in 13 patients for whom diagnosis based on
imaging and AFP was uncertain.
Clinicopathological Data
Demographic and clinicopathological data for the 392 HCC
patients are listed in Table 1. Most clinical characteristics were
similar between the groups at baseline (Table 1). There were no
significant differences in gender composition; tumor number;
hepatitis incidence; levels of AFP, albumin, or alanine amino￾transferase (ALT); prothrombin time; or hospital mortality.
Patients in the TACE group were significantly older and had
larger tumors and higher total serum bilirubin than those in the
LR group. However, patients in the LR group had higher serum
platelet counts, and they experienced more postoperative compli￾cations. The median age of all patients was ,50 years. More than
90% of patients were male and HBsAg-positive. The proportion of
hepatitis C virus infection was 2%.
Mortality and Morbidity
The in-hospital mortality rate was similar in the LR group
(3.1%) and the TACE group (3.7%). However, the postoperative

complication rate was higher in the LR group (28%) than in the
TACE group (18.5%; P = 0.04). The most common complication
of LR was pulmonary infection (7%), while liver function failure
(4.4%) was the most common complication of TACE. The specific
complications of the two group patients are listed in Table 2.
Survival Analysis
The overall survival rate was significantly better in the LR
group than in the TACE group (P,0.05; Fig. 1). During a mean
follow-up period of 29614 months, 88 patients (34%) in the LR
group and 73 patients (54%) in the TACE group died. The 1-, 3-
and 5-year overall survival rates of patients in the LR group were
84%, 59%, and 37%, while the corresponding rates in the TACE
group were 69%, 29%, and 14% (P,0.001). Median survival time
was 42.9 months in the LR group and 21.0 months in the TACE
group (P,0.001).
Several factors linked to survival were taken into account in the
survival analysis (Table 3). Univariate analysis showed that tumor
size, serum ALT level, serum AFP level ($400 ng/ml), serum total
bilirubin level, and treatment modalities were predictors of
survival in the total study population. Multivariate analysis showed
that serum AFP level $400 ng/ml (HR = 1.398, 95% CI 1.071–
1.824, P = 0.014), serum ALT level (HR = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001–
1.005, P = 0.027), and treatment modalities (HR = 2.149, 95% CI
1.592–2.902, P , 0.001) were predictors of survival (Table 3).
Survival Analysis of Patients with a Single Large Tumor
The overall survival rate of patients with a single large tumor
was significantly better in the LR group than in the TACE group
(P,0.001; Fig. 2). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates of
patients after LR were 87%, 65%, and 41%; the corresponding
rates for patients after TACE were 69%, 30%, and 18%.
Survival Analysis of Patients with Multiple Tumors
The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates for patients with
multiple tumors were significantly better in the LR group (76%,
39%, and 24%) than in the TACE group (68%, 25%, and 4%)
(P = 0.036; Fig. 3).
Survival Analysis with Propensity Score
Subsequently, for minimize the confounding factors, propensity
score analysis with one-to-one nearest neighbor matching method
was applied, including age, gender, tumor size and number, serum
bilirubin, ALT, albumin, and AFP. Sixty-one pair patients were

matched in each group. The above eight factors appeared to be
well matched between groups. After matching, the overall survival
rates of the LR group were also superior to that of the TACE
group, with 87% vs. 77%, 62% vs. 44%, and 35% vs. 20%,
respectively, for the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates
(P = 0.025, Fig. 4).
Discussion
This study shows that LR can offer better overall survival than
TACE for selected BCLC-B HCC patients, and that both
techniques offer acceptable morbidity and similar in-hospital
mortality. Since large tumor size [24,25,26] and multiple nodules
[25,26,27] are independent risk factors of recurrence and mortality
[28], we analyzed overall survival for patients with large tumor size
or multiple nodules independently. Results showed that LR can
still offer better overall survival than TACE in both types of
patients.
Our results in total population and propensity model analysis
are consistent with recent reports that LR offers the best survival
benefit for patients with BCLC-B HCC
[14,15,24,27,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. Therefore, large tumor size
and multiple tumors should not exclude patients from LR. This
surgery has also been shown to provide better quality of life than
TACE for HCC patients [36].
The BCLC classification system has traditionally been used to
guide treatment selection for patients with BCLC-B HCC.
However, this system may not always provide the most appropri￾ate recommendation. Surgical resection is the only hope for
BCLC-B and -C HCC patients, but the BCLC classification
considers these patients unsuitable for LR [37]. In recent decades,
with advances in surgical techniques and preoperative prepara￾tion, the indications for LR have expanded. It is now considered a
safe and routine surgical procedure and there is no absolute
contraindication for it.
The BCLC staging classification recommends TACE as
essentially the only option for patients with BCLC-B HCC and
for some patients with BCLC-C HCC [4]. However, the BCLC-B
stage includes a heterogeneous population of HCC patients, which
means that not all patients will derive the same survival benefits
from TACE [11]. In fact, the lack of a standard treatment
methodology and patient selection criteria for TACE has made it
difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the efficacy of the
procedure for BCLC-B and -C HCC patients [11]. In addition,
TACE can lead to drug resistance in some patients [38].
In order to compare the efficacy of LR for BCLC-B and C
HCC reported by other recent studies, we address a comprehen￾sive literature review on the subject (Table 4)
[14,15,16,24,27,29,31,32,33,34,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46]. Our re￾sults show LR to offer better survival rates than TACE in the
shorter and longer term (1 year, 84 vs. 69%; 3 years, 59 vs. 29%; 5
years, 37 vs. 14%; P,0.001). This is similar to a 3-year survival
rate of 30% after TACE reported in other studies [24,29]. In
contrast, for patients with BCLC-B HCC who underwent LR, the
median survival was 28 to 60 months, 3-year overall survival was
37–72%, and 5-year overall survival was 32–60%. Even for
patients with BCLC-C HCC, the 5-year overall survival was more
than 10% (Table 4). Actually, the recent study with large sample
size by Torzilli and coworkers [46] collecting data from 10 centers
showed that LR is in current practice widely. For patients with
limited disease, there are no restrictions on tumor size, number or
macrovascular invasion. Therefore, the BCLC selection criteria
for LR seem too restrictive and should be expanded so that it can
be considered a treatment option for patients with BCLC-B and -
C HCC.

Liver Resection and TACE for BCLC-B HCC
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68193

Our results, obtained with a population in southern China, are
similar to those reported in studies in other Asian populations. Our
data showed 3- and 5-year overall survival of LR patients of 59%
and 37%, with a median survival time of 43 months. These results
are similar to those reported by Wang and coworkers [29] for
patients in Taiwan. In another study conducted in Taiwan, overall
survival for patients with $2 tumors was higher after LR than
after TACE [15]. A study by Hsu et al. [24] in Taiwan compared
the efficacy of LR and TACE for patients with HCC beyond the
Milan criteria. This study concluded that LR is as safe as TACE
and provides better long-term survival for HCC patients beyond
the Milan criteria [24]. In a retrospective study very similar to
ours, Lin et al. [27] included 171 patients in Taiwan with BCLC￾B/Child-Pugh A HCC. Those authors also found LR to be as safe
as TACE and to provide better survival rates. The 3-year overall
survival was 49% for the LR group and 2% for the TACE group
(P,0.001) [27]. Taken together, these studies argue for consid￾ering LR as the preferred treatment for patients with BCLC-B
HCC.
Several studies have examined prognostic factors for survival of
BCLC-B HCC patients after LR [15,24,27,31]. These studies
reported different risk factors linked to long-term survival.
Generally speaking, patients with no risk factors are predicted to
have the best prognosis, while patients with three or more risk
factors are predicted to have the worst overall survival [31]. In the
present study, tumor size, ALT, AFP ($400 ng/ml), total
bilirubin, and TACE were associated with worse overall survival.
However, on multivariate analysis, only AFP ($400 ng/ml), ALT,
and TACE were independent predictors of overall survival.
Another study [47] also found AFP level to be an independent
predictor of mortality in hepatitis C-related HCC. Though a few
recent studies [48,49] proposed that preoperative AFP levels are
not useful for predicting postoperative survival of patients with
early-stage HCC, AFP is used as a biomarker of HCC diagnosis
[50] and has even proven useful as a marker for predicting
antitumor response after radiofrequency ablation [51] and
sorafenib therapy [52].
Like AFP, serum ALT was a predictor of survival in our BCLC￾B HCC patients. This may reflect the fact that more than 90% of
our HCC patients were HBV carriers; in such patients, long-term
change in serum ALT is an independent predictor of risk for HCC
[53]. At the same time, ALT is a widely used indicator of liver
function and serum ALT level is associated with the degree of
inflammation in liver disease [54]. Thus we may have detected
ALT as a survival predictor because HCC patients with long-term
HBV infection have worse prognosis.
There are several potential limitations of this study. First, most
of our patients were males younger than 50 with chronic HBV
infection. Therefore, the results may not be representative of all
HCC patients. Second, this is a retrospective study, so there may
have been selection bias. Nevertheless, all the patients in this study
were admitted consecutively into our hospital for treatment.
Moreover, the results from the propensity score analysis were
similar to that from the overall population. Third, our results

Liver Resection and TACE for BCLC-B HCC

showing the superior results of LR compared to TACE should be
used with discretion, since when tumor recurrence occurs or is
likely, other therapies such as sorafenib, TACE or conservative
treatment should be adopted.
In conclusion, LR yielded better overall survival than TACE in
patients with BCLC-B HCC. For BCLC-B HCC patients with
preserved liver function, LR may be considered the preferred
treatment. However, prospective studies with large sample size are
needed to reassess the efficacy of LR for these patients.
