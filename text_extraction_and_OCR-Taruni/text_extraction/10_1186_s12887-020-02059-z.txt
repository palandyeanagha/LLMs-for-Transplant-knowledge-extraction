Abstract
Background: To report the outcomes of hepatoblastoma resected in our institution.
Methods: We diagnosed 135 children with hepatoblastoma at our institution between January 2010 and
December 2017. Patients who underwent liver resection were included for analysis. However, patients who
abandoned treatment after diagnosis were excluded from analysis, but their clinical characteristics were provided in
the supplementary material.
Results: Forty-two patients abandoned treatment, whereas 93 patients underwent liver resection and were
included for statistical analysis. Thirty-six, 23, 3, and 31 patients had PRETEXT stages II, III, IV, and unspecified
tumours, respectively. Seven patients had ruptured tumour; 9 had lung metastasis (one patient had portal vein
thrombosis concurrently). Sixteen patients underwent primary liver resection; 22, 25, and 30 patients received
cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and delayed surgery, preoperative transarterial chemoembolization
(TACE) and delayed surgery, and a combination of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, TACE, and delayed
surgery, respectively. Forty patients had both PRETEXT and POST-TEXT information available for analysis. Twelve
patients were down-staged after preoperative treatment, including 2, 8, and 2 patients from stages IV to III, III to II,
and II to I, respectively. Ten patients with unspecified PRETEXT stage were confirmed to have POST-TEXT stages II
(n = 8) and I (n = 2) tumours. Seven tumours were associated with positive surgical margins, and 12 patients had
microvascular involvement. During a median follow-up period of 30.5 months, 84 patients survived without relapse,
9 experienced tumour recurrence, and 4 died. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates
were 89.4 ± 3.4%, and 95.2 ± 2.4%, respectively; they were significantly better among patients without metastasis (no
metastasis vs metastasis: EFS, 93.5 ± 3.7% vs 46.7 ± 19.0%, adjusted p = 0.002. OS, 97.6 ± 2.4% vs 61.0 ± 18.1%,
adjusted p = 0.005), and similar among patients treated with different preoperative strategies (chemotherapy only vs
TACE only vs Both: EFS, 94.7 ± 5.1% vs 91.7 ± 5.6% vs 85.6 ± 6.7%, p = 0.542. OS, 94.1 ± 5.7% vs 95.7 ± 4.3% vs 96.7 ±
3.3%, p = 0.845).

Conclusion: The OS for patients with hepatoblastoma who underwent liver resection was satisfactory. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and TACE seemed to have a similar effect on OS. However, the abandonment of treatment by
patients with hepatoblastoma was common, and may have biased our results.
Keywords: Hepatoblastoma, Surgery, Children, Liver tumour
Background
Hepatoblastoma is tshe most common childhood liver
malignancy, and has a prevalence of 1 per 1,000,000
population [1, 2]. The incidence of hepatoblastoma
has increased in the past two decades, and this up￾ward trend has been correlated with an increasing
survival rate among premature and low-birth-weight
infants [3]. Hepatoblastoma usually affects children
younger than 3 years, and presents as a large abdom￾inal mass. Some patients may present with sudden
abdominal pain and haemorrhagic shock in the sce￾nario of tumour rupture. A combination of elevated
α-fetoprotein protein (AFP) level and radiographically
identified hepatic mass suffices for the clinical diagno￾sis of hepatoblastoma in children with ages between
6 months and 3 years. However, biopsy, preferably via
ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended
for patients of all age groups [4, 5].
The treatment of hepatoblastoma is multidisciplinary;
a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and
complete surgical removal is the mainstay of treatment.
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and surgical resection
provide standard-risk patients with a 5-year overall sur￾vival (OS) of more than 90% [6, 7]. Primary hepatic re￾section is recommended for patients with PRETEXT
stages I and II tumours with no additional annotative
risk factors. Otherwise, patients should undergo neoad￾juvant chemotherapy and delayed surgery. Orthotopic
liver transplantation is an ideal treatment option for pa￾tients with PRETEXT stage IV hepatoblastomas and
other forms of unresectable hepatoblastomas, and can
provide them with more than 80% 5-year OS in the con￾temporary era [7–9]. Trans-arterial chemoembolization
(TACE) alone, or in combination with high-intensity fo￾cused ultrasound, may be considered for those with
unresectable tumours that are not responsive to primary
systemic chemotherapy and are also not suitable for liver
transplantations [10].
Nonetheless, the outcomes of hepatoblastoma in de￾veloping countries are still far more inferior to those in
developed countries [11]. Treatment abandonment
among children with cancer is not an unusual
phenomenon in developing countries, particularly
among those with advanced stage cancers [12]. Further￾more, patients in developing countries have far more
limited access to liver transplantation. In order to
improve the management and outcomes of hepatoblas￾toma in developing countries, such experiences are
worth reporting. Herein, we described our experiences
in treating hepatoblastoma at a tertiary hospital in South
China.
Methods
The diagnosis of hepatoblastoma was initially made
based on an elevated AFP level and radiographic detec￾tion of a liver mass, and confirmed via pathological
examination of samples obtained via either biopsy or pri￾mary liver resection. Only hepatoblastoma patients who
underwent liver resection were included for statistical
analysis. Patients who abandoned treatment were ex￾cluded from further analysis. Patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma and other liver malignancies were excluded.
One hundred and thirty-five children were diagnosed
with hepatoblastoma at our institution between January
2010 and December 2017. Forty-two cases were ex￾cluded from the analysis mainly due to treatment aban￾donment, including 6 cases who died due to aggressive
tumour progression prior to treatment and 36 cases that
received no further treatment after diagnosis. The demo￾graphic and clinical characteristics of these excluded pa￾tients was collected and analysed. Our study analysed 93
cases that were treated according to the institutional
protocol and underwent liver resection. Preoperative
TACE was optional and available for patients with PRE￾TEXT stage III and IV tumours, after evaluated by the
interventional radiologist. The chemotherapy regimens
of COG (Children’s Oncology Group), SIOPEL (Inter￾national Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group), and
our national regimens were used. All these chemother￾apy regiments were cisplatin-based and were reported to
have similar effects and achieved similar survival out￾comes [13]. Patients were followed up at the clinic and
via regular telephone calls. The primary outcome was to
evaluate the event-free survival and overall survival of
hepatoblastoma resected in our institution. The second￾ary outcome was to analyse factors that would impact
survival in this cohort of patients. The OS duration was
defined as the interval between the time of diagnosis and
the time of death, and event-free survival (EFS) as the
interval between the time of diagnosis and the time of
the first occurrence of tumour progression, relapse, or
death, whichever occurred first.
Li et al. BMC Pediatrics (2020) 20:200 Page 2 of 11

We collected information regarding patients’ demo￾graphic data, including age and gender; clinical data in￾cluding AFP level, radiographic findings, pre-treatment
extent of tumour (PRETEXT) and post-treatment extent
of tumour (POST-TEXT) staging, preoperative manage￾ment strategy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and TACE),
and liver resection technique; pathological findings includ￾ing pathological subtype, surgical margin status, micro￾vascular involvement, and lymph node involvement; and
clinical outcomes including disease relapse and death.
A standard data extraction form with a logical organ￾isation similar in flow to the format of the original med￾ical charts, was used to collect data. Two trained data
abstractors, who were blinded to the study hypothesis,
independently reviewed the original medical charts and
collected data. Explicit criteria for extracting data re￾garding variables were applied. Any discrepancies be￾tween the abstractors were reviewed jointly and
discussed to clarify any issues [14].
A senior radiologist, who was blinded to the study ob￾jective, retrospectively reviewed patients’ computed tom￾ography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data. The radiologist defined the PRETEXT/POST￾TEXT system and annotation factors according to the
PRETEXT staging system [15]. Not all patients had CT/
MRI images stored in the electronic database; only pa￾tients who underwent CT/MRI scans at our institution
had their radiographic images stored.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of Guangzhou Women and Children’s
Medical Centre. The need for informed consent was
waived on account of the retrospective nature of the
demographic, clinical, and outcome data. All patients’
data were de-identified prior to the analysis.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as numbers and per￾centages. Continuous variables are presented as medians
and ranges. The PRETEXT and POST-TEXT stages
were compared using the McNemar chi-square test. The
comparison of different management strategies was
analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The prob￾abilities of OS and EFS were computed using the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank
test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 and p￾values of the paired tests in the log-rank test were
adjusted using the Bonferroni method. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 for Windows
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics
Of the 93 patients who underwent liver resection, 66
(60.2%) were male and 37 (39.8%) were female (Table 1).
The median age at diagnosis was 11 (range, 1.7–87)
months. The median AFP level was 76,131 (range, 10–1,
881,360) ng/ml and the median tumour diameter was
10.6 (range, 5.1–15.8) cm. Fifty-seven (61.3%) patients
had unifocal tumours, 7 (7.5%) had multifocal tumours,
and 29 (31.2%) had tumours with unspecified focality.
Thirty-six (38.7%) patients had PRETEXT stage II tu￾mours, 23 (24.7%) had stage III tumours, 3 (3.2%) had
stage IV tumours, and 31 (33.3%) had tumours with un￾specified PRETEXT stages. Seven (7.5%) patients had
ruptured tumours. Nine patients (9.7%) had lung metas￾tasis, three of them had single lung metastasis and 6 had
multiple lung metastasis [1 (1.1%) had portal vein
thrombosis concurrently]. Sixteen (17.2%) patients
underwent primary liver resection. Twenty-two patients
(23.7%) received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemother￾apy and delayed surgery, 25 (26.9%) received preopera￾tive TACE and delayed surgery, and 30 (32.3%) received
a combination of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemo￾therapy, TACE, and delayed surgery. PRETEXT stage
distribution of each treatment group was provided in
supplementary Table 1. The median number of treat￾ment cycles was 2.5 (range, 1–8) for neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and 2 (range, 1–7) for preoperative
TACE. Forty patients had information regarding both
PRETEXT and POST-TEXT stages available for analysis.
Using the McNemar test, significant downstage was
noted for the 12 cases with both PRETEXT and POST￾TEXT stage information (p < 0.001). Specifically, 2 cases
from stage IV to III, 8 from stage III to II, and 2 from
stage II to I. Furthermore, 10 patients with unspecified
PRETEXT stage were confirmed to have POST-TEXT
stages II (n = 8) and I (n = 2) tumours.
The detailed demographic and clinical characteristics
of the excluded 42 patients were listed in supplementary
Table 2. The excluded patients were significantly higher
in age, AFP value, and PRETEXT stage than the in￾cluded 93 patients. Additionally, more patients of the ex￾cluded group had lung metastases and portal vein
thrombosis. The overall outcomes of these patients were
largely unknown, and these patients were excluded from
further analysis.
Surgery and outcomes
Thirty-seven (39.8%) patients underwent hemihepatect￾omy, 17 (18.3%) underwent wedge resection, 13 (14.0%)
underwent trisectionectomy, 9 (9.7%) underwent biseg￾mentectomy (left lateral sectionectomy), and 2 (2.2%)
underwent central hepatectomy (Table 2). Fifteen pa￾tients underwent liver resection at other institutions, but
detailed surgical information was not available. Seventy￾eight patients were operated in our institution, and sur￾gical information was collected and analysed. The opera￾tive time, estimated volume of blood lost, and volume of

red blood cells transfused were 290 (range, 100–510) mi￾nutes, 8.9 (range, 1.7–111.1) ml/kg, and 26.7 (range, 0–
111.1) ml/kg, respectively. There were 24 (25.8%) cases
of epithelial variant hepatoblastoma, 11 (11.8%) cases of
mixed epithelial hepatoblastoma, and 41 (44.1%) cases of
mixed epithelial and mesenchymal hepatoblastoma; 17
cases were not sub-classified. Seven (7.5%) cases had
positive surgical margins, 69 (74.2%) had negative surgi￾cal margins, and 17 (18.3%) had unspecified surgical
margin status. Twelve (12.9%) patients had microvascu￾lar involvement, 43 (46.2%) had no microvascular in￾volvement, and 38 (40.9%) cases had unspecified
microvascular status. Thirty-one patients underwent
lymph node dissection, none of whom had positive
lymph node involvement. Among the 9 patients with
lung metastasis, one underwent metastasectomy.
Sixty-three (67.7%) patients received cisplatin-based
postoperative chemotherapy, with a median of 6 (range,
1–12) cycles. Twenty-seven (29.0%) patients received no
postoperative chemotherapy. During a median follow-up
duration of 30.5 (range, 0.7–105.1) months, 84 (90.3%)
cases survived without relapse, 9 (9.7%) experienced dis￾ease recurrence, and 4 (5.4%) died. For the 9 patients
with lung metastasis, 5 of them survived with metastasis
cleared, 1 died, and 3 were lost to follow-up.
Subgroup analysis of managements
In this study, the differences in management between
patients without metastasis and patients with metastasis
(1 of them had portal vein thrombosis at the same time)
[cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 1(0–6) vs 2(0–8),
p = 0.060; cycle of preoperative TACE: 0(0–5) vs 1(0–7),
p = 0.589; cycle of postoperative chemotherapy: 6(0–12)
vs 6(2–10), p = 0.817], and patients with negative surgi￾cal margin and positive surgical margins [cycle of neoad￾juvant chemotherapy: 1(0–8) vs 1(0–3), p = 0.482; cycle
of preoperative TACE: 1(0–5) vs 2(0–7), p = 0.081; cycle
of postoperative chemotherapy: 6(0–12) vs 7(2–12), p =
0.946] were not statistically significant.
Failure among patients with tumour recurrence
Among the 9 patients with tumour recurrence, the me￾dian time from diagnosis to recurrence was 8.5 (range,
0.7–22.4) months, and the median time from surgery to
recurrence was 3.6 (range, 0.5–22.0) months. Among the
4 patients who died as a result of tumour recurrence,
the median time from diagnosis to death was 11.3
(range, 3.6–21.4) months. Their treatment and outcome
information are summarised in Table 3. Five patients
underwent wedge resection, and 1 underwent left hepa￾tectomy associated with a positive surgical margin.
Survival
The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival
(OS) rates were 89.4 ± 3.4%, and 95.2 ± 2.4% (Figs. 1a
and 2a), respectively. The 2-year EFS and OS rates were
significantly better among patients without metastasis
(no metastasis vs metastasis: EFS, 93.5 ± 3.7% vs 46.7 ±
19.0%, p = 0.002, OS, 97.6 ± 2.4% vs 61.0 ± 18.1%, p =
0.005) (Figs. 1c and 2c). The 2-year EFS rates were
significantly better among patients without microvascu￾lar involvement (No vs Involvement: EFS, 95.3 ± 3.3% vs
67.3 ± 16.0%, p = 0.022), while the 2-year OS rates were
similar (OS, 97.7 ± 2.3% vs 90.0 ± 9.5%, p = 0.313). The
differences of the 2-year EFS and OS rates of patients
with PRETEXT stage IV hepatoblastoma (II vs III vs IV:
EFS, 84.0 ± 6.7% vs 95.7 ± 4.3% vs 66.7 ± 27.2%, p = 0.225.
OS, 90.1 ± 5.5% vs 95.5 ± 4.4% vs 100.0%, p = 0.547),
positive surgical margins (negative vs positive: EFS,
92.0 ± 3.5% vs 64.3 ± 21.0%, p = 0.100. OS, 95.0 ± 2.8% vs
83.3 ± 15.2%, p = 0.369) were not statistically significant.
The 2-year EFS and OS rates were also similar among
patients treated with different preoperative strategies
(Chemotherapy only vs TACE only vs Both: EFS, 94.7 ±
5.1% vs 91.7 ± 5.6% vs 85.6 ± 6.7%, p = 0.542. OS, 94.1 ±
5.7% vs 95.7 ± 4.3% vs 96.7 ± 3.3% p = 0.845) (Figs. 1d
and 2d).
Discussion
Here, we reported the outcomes of resected hepatoblas￾toma at a tertiary children’s institution in a developing
country. The 2-year EFS and OS rates among patients
who underwent hepatic resection were satisfactory. Pa￾tients associated with distant metastasis had a worse
prognosis, with 2-year EFS and OS rates of about 46.7 ±
19.0% and 61.0 ± − 18.1%, respectively. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and TACE seem to have similar effects
on the 2-year EFS and OS.

Both cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
preoperative TACE were used at our institution as pre￾operative strategies to shrink the tumour and downstage
the tumour [16]. However, our results showed no signifi￾cant differences regarding the effect of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and TACE on 2-year EFS and OS. Simi￾larly, evidence from the Japanese Study Group for Paedi￾atric Liver Tumour (JPLT) and our institution showed
that TACE was as effective as neoadjuvant chemother￾apy in shrinking and down-staging tumours [16, 17].
However, the JPLT study showed that the OS was infer￾ior to that of those who underwent neoadjuvant chemo￾therapy [17]. TACE could be an option for patients who
fail to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further￾more, TACE is particularly useful for patients who ex￾perience tumour rupture [18]. Currently, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is considered the first choice for the pre￾operative management of hepatoblastoma. However, no
prospective study has compared the effect of neoadju￾vant chemotherapy and TACE on hepatoblastoma. It
would be valuable to compare these two strategies in a
prospective or randomized trial.
Patients with tumour metastasis had significantly
lower 2-year EFS and OS. The 2-year EFS and OS for
patients with metastatic disease were only about 46.7 ±
19.0% and 61.0 ± 18.1%, respectively. Our result was con￾sistent with the SIOPEL experiences, which showed that
hepatoblastoma with metastasis has a 3-year EFS of 49%
[19]. However, we failed to demonstrate that patients
with PRETEXT stage IV tumours had significantly worse
EFS and OS probabilities than those with tumours of
other stages. However, our cohort only had 3 cases with
PRETEXT stage IV tumours. Two cases were down￾staged to POST-TEXT stage III, and the other died.
The 2-year EFS and OS for patients with positive
surgical margins were lower than those of their coun￾terparts, but the differences were not statistically sig￾nificant. The evidence suggested that positive surgical
margin might not affect the EFS and OS in the set￾ting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy [20]. However, this
might not be true in the setting of primary resection.
Complete resection with a negative resection margin
should always be pursued. Microvascular involvement
was suggested to be a poor prognostic factor in a
retrospective study [21]. In our cohort, 12 (12.9%) pa￾tients had microvascular involvement, 43 patients had
no microvascular involvement, and 38 patients had
tumours with unspecified microvascular status. Our
data suggested that patients with microvascular in￾volvement had significant lower 2-year EFS than those
without microvascular involvement, but the OS were
similar between the two groups. Again, in the current
Children’s Hepatic tumours International Collabor￾ation classification system, microvascular involvement
is not considered as a risk factor [6, 22].
Hepatoblastoma seemed not to spread through the
lymph nodes. None of the 31 patients who underwent
lymph node biopsy had positive lymph node
involvement.
Five out of 9 patients who experienced relapse or died
underwent wedge resection. This suggests that wedge re￾section might be associated with worse outcomes.

Standard hepatic resection should always be pursued in
any possible scenario.
Due to the retrospective nature of this study, we were
unable to retrieve some of the important information.
For example, some of the patients did not undergo
preoperative CT or MRI scans for PRETEXT staging.
Furthermore, a large proportion of the patients aban￾doned or discontinued treatment after the establishment
of the diagnosis. These patients will most likely fall into
the high-risk group (Supplemental Table 2). In fact, the
excluded patients were significantly higher in age and
PRETEXT stage than included patients. Among the

excluded patients, more patients had metastasis and por￾tal vein thrombosis. Overall, the excluded patients
mostly had advanced stage hepatoblastoma, and would
have much worse survival. Unfortunately, we were not
able to follow these excluded patients. The exclusion of
these patients will incur selection bias. Treatment
abandonment is not an unusual phenomenon in devel￾oping countries, which underscores the need for more
attention and funding for this vulnerable population [23,
24]. Furthermore, the follow-up duration was not long
enough, and the EFS and OS might either be overesti￾mated if patients abandoned treatment due to poor

results, or underestimated if patients abandoned treat￾ment because their parents prematurely assumed they
were cured. An assessment of the interactions between
different characteristics requires more stable follow-up
with larger samples.
Conclusions
The overall outcomes for those who underwent liver
resection was satisfactory. However, the abandonment of
treatment by patients with hepatoblastoma was com￾mon. A large proportion of patients discontinued treat￾ment after the diagnosis.
