Abstract
A 46-year-old man presented with a huge splenic ar￾tery dissecting aneurysm that had been incidentally
found and was successfully resected before rupture. The
histopathologic findings were compatible with segmental
mediolytic arteriopathy (SMA). Simultaneous involve￾ment of the left renal and right commoniliac artery was
observed. The patient was also found to have an
adrenocortical adenoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor,
hepatocellular carcinoma and schizophrenia. The rela￾tionship between SMAand other accompanying diseases
was discussed.

Introduction
Dissecting aneurysmsof muscular splanchnic arteries of
the abdomenare uncommonand the pathogenesis is poorly
understood. Segmental mediolytic arteriopathy (SMA), for￾merly called segmental mediolytic arteritis (1), is a rare
nonatherosclerotic and nonvasculitic arteriopathy of un￾known cause. SMAinvolves small to medium-sized intraab￾dominal muscular arteries, or less frequently, intracranial,
coronary and pulmonary arteries. SMAis considered to be
one of the causes of sudden, catastrophic intraabdominal
hemorrhage. Acute splenic artery dissection is rare and most
cases are diagnosed after death, except for two surviving
cases (2, 3).
Here, we present a case of SMAin which the preoperative
magnetic resonance (MR) angiography revealed multiple ab￾dominal splanchnic artery aneurysms before rupture and suc￾cessful surgical resection of the huge dissecting aneurysm of
the splenic artery could be performed.
Case Report
A 46-year-old man was admitted to Nagasaki University
Hospital on May 31, 2002 for the evaluation of an abdominal
tumor, which was incidentally found by a cardiovascular sur￾geon. In his family history, his father and elder brother had
hypertension and his mother had uterus cancer. He was diag￾nosed as having schizophrenia at the age of 29. Hypertension
and hypokalemia due to primary aldosteronism (left
adrenocortical adenoma) have been treated with spirono￾lactone since 1999.
Physical examination on admission revealed an obese
male (height, 168 cm; body weight, 84 kg), normal blood
pressure (120/70 mmHg),pulse rate of 72 beats per minute
and absolutely irregular. Examination of the heart, lungs and
abdomenwas unremarkable except for an upper abdominal
tumor.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated chronic atrial fibrillation.
The hematologic tests showed a hemoglobin of ll.2 g/dl,
hematocrit of 36.1%, platelet count of 139,000/mm3, and
white blood cell count of 3,600/mm3. Analysis of blood
chemistry was as follows: total protein, 6.2 g/dl; albumin, 3.7
g/dl; thymol turbidity test (TTT), 15.9 kunkel; zinc sulfate
turbidity test (ZTT), 13.0 kunkel; sodium, 146 mEq/Z; potas￾sium, 3.6 mEq//; chloride, 110 mEq//; calcium, 16 mg/dl;
urea nitrogen, 12 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dl; asparate
aminotransferase (AST), 33 IU/Z; alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), 39 IU/Z; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 288 IU/Z;

envelope antigen (HBeAg), 0.1 COI; anti-HBV envelope an￾tibody (HBeAb) >xl00, suggesting the existence of hepato￾cellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B.
Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan
(Fig. 1) and MRangiography (Fig. 2) revealed a huge
splenic artery aneurysm (7.5x9.5 cm, including mural throm￾bus), an aneurysm in the middle portion of the left renal ar￾tery (1.0 cm) and a fusiform right common iliac artery
aneurysm (3.5 cm). No extravasation of contrast media was
noted. Well enhanced tumors in right lobe of the liver, 4.Ox
3.0 cm in diameter, and in the left adrenal gland, 2.5x3.0 cm
in diameter were seen, suggesting the existence of HCC,and
adrenal adenoma, respectively. A slightly enhanced tumor in
the splenic hilum (3.5x2.5 cm in diameter) was also detected
and diagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST),
pathologically.
Since the huge splenic artery aneurysm had not ruptured
and the spleen was not infarcted, the patient underwent only
the resection of the splenic artery aneurysm. Moreoverthere
wasno color change of the residual spleen, suggesting the
existence of other feeding collaterals to the spleen; we did
not perform splenectomy or reconstruction of the splenic ar￾tery (Fig. 3). Histological examination disclosed the lesion to
be a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery. However, neither
atherosclerotic change nor vasculitis was observed. Dissec￾tion of the medeia resulted in the formation of dissecting
hematoma, causing the stenosis of the true lumen of the ar￾tery (Figs. 4, 5). The segmental mediolysis of the media of
the artery, which is the histopathological hallmark of SMA
was observed at the proximal portion of the resected artery
(Fig. 5). These findings were compatible with SMA. The
tumor which was detected in the hilum of the spleen was also
resected. The tumor originated from the body of the stomach,
3 cm in diameter. Histopathologically, the tumor consisted of
a spindle cell proliferation in a fascicular or interlacing pat￾tern. Mitotic activity was counted as 5 per 25 high power
fields (HPF). The lesion was diagnosed as a GIST, uncom￾mitted type because of the positive immunostaining for c-kit,
CD34 and vimentin, and negative staining for a smooth

muscle actin and S I00 protein. Transcatheter hepatic arterial
embolization for the HCCwas successfully performed, al￾though selective catheterization to the hepatic artery via the
true lumen was difficult since celiac to commonhepatic ar￾tery was also dissected and enlarged. The postoperative
course of the patient was uneventful and he was discharged
2 weeks after surgery.
Discussion
SMAwas first described as a distinct pathologic entity by
Slavin and Gonzalez-Vitale in 1976 (1) and less than twenty
cases involving abdominal splanchnic arteries have been re- ported in the literature (Table 1) (1, 3-13). Abdominal SMA
occurs in the middle aged to elderly, ranging from 39 to 87
years, in both sexes. It usually involves more than one vis￾ceral artery, and branches of the celiac axis are most fre￾quently affected by SMA. Our case showed multiple
aneurysms in celiac, splenic, left renal and right common
iliac arteries and histopathologic examination of the resected
splenic artery was compatible with SMA.
In the first report, Slavin and Gonzalez-Vitale thought the
SMAwas an immunecomplex arteritis and used the term
"segmental mediolytic arteritis" (1). However, there are a

few reports of SMAaccompanied with autoimmune disease,
such as systemic lupus erythematosus, microscopic polyarth￾ritis nodosa (8, 10) and thus the immunologic etiology was
abandoned, the term was changed to "segmental mediolytic
arteriopathy" and they proposed that the arterial lesions of
SMAwere caused by vasospasm (4). Before the concept of
SMA was proposed, the main pathological diagnoses of
splenic artery dissection were cystic medial degeneration and
fibromuscular dysplasia (2). Lie proposed that SMAwas
represented as a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia (14) and
Slavin et al also suggested that the SMA might be a
precursor lesion of fibromuscular dysplasia (9). Leu reported
that the morphology of SMAresembles that of cystic medial
necrosis of the aorta, which may occur in any muscular ar￾tery (15). Although the pathogenesis of SMA remains con￾troversial and the strategy for its treatment has not been
established, in the present case, we decided to resect the an￾eurysmbecause the size of the splenic artery aneurysmwas
huge and was most likely to rupture. Carr et al recommended
operative treatment for splenic artery aneurysms greater than
2.5 cm(16). Recently only one case has been reported
whereby coil embolization of SMAof the hepatic artery an￾eurysm was performed (17); vascular intervention such as
coil embolization or stent graft may be an option for the

treatment of SMA.
Incidentally, a simultaneous gastric mass was also found
in this patient. It was histologically identified as cellular
spindle cell tumor and characteristically expressed c-kit and
CD34, which were consistent with GIST, uncommitted type.
Since the mitotic counts exceeded 5 per 50 HPF, and the
subtype was uncommitted type, this tumor was thought to be
malignant, although the size was smaller than 5 cm (18). The
existence of HCCand adrenal adenomawas strongly sug￾gested by clinical and radiological examinations, though it
was not confirmed histopathologically. The relation of these
coexisting diseases and multiple splanchnic artery aneurysm
is unclear and it might be impossible to explain that these
various diseases originate monogenetically. However, from
the embryological point of view, smooth muscle cells, adre￾nal cortex and GIST are mesodermally derived and an abnor￾mality of mesodermal development or differentiation might
be related to the pathogenesis of SMA.
