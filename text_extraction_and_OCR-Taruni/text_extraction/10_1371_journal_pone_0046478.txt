Abstract
Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous balloon dilation of biliary-enteric anastomotic strictures resulting from
surgical repair of laparoscopic cholecystectomy-related bile duct injuries.
Material and Methods: A total of 61 patients were referred to our institution from 1995 to 2010 for treatment of obstruction
at the biliary-enteric anastomosis following surgical repair of laparoscopic cholecystectomy-related bile duct injuries. Of
these 61 patients, 27 underwent surgical revision upon stricture diagnosis, and 34 patients were managed using balloon
dilation. Of these 34 patients, 2 were lost to follow up, leaving 32 patients for analysis. The primary study objective was to
determine the clinical success rate of balloon dilation of biliary-enteric anastomotic strictures. Secondary study objectives
included determining anastomosis patency, rates of stricture recurrence following treatment, and morbidity.
Results: Balloon dilation of biliary-enteric anastomotic strictures was clinically successful in 21 of 32 patients (66%).
Anastomotic stricture recurred in one of 21 patients (5%) after an average of 13.1 years of follow-up. Patients who were
unsuccessfully managed with balloon dilation required significantly more invasive procedures (6.8 v. 3.4; p = 0.02) and were
left with an indwelling biliary catheter for a significantly longer period of time (8.8 v. 2.0 months; p = 0.02) than patients
whose strictures could be resolved by balloon dilation. No significant differences in the number of balloon dilations
performed (p = 0.17) or in the maximum balloon diameter used (p = 0.99) were demonstrated for patients with successful or
unsuccessful balloon dilation outcomes.
Conclusion: Percutaneous balloon dilation of anastomotic biliary strictures following surgical repair of laparoscopic
cholecystectomy-related injuries may result in lasting patency of the biliary-enteric anastomosis.

Introduction
Cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly performed
elective surgical procedures in the world. In the United States
alone approximately 750,000 operations are performed annually
[1]. Since its introduction in the 1990s, the laparoscopic surgical
approach has generally offered quicker recovery times and a lower
rate of complications over the traditional open approach.
However, the laparoscopic approach has also led to an estimated
three to four-fold increase in the incidence of bile duct injuries [2–
5]. Bile duct injuries occur in about 1 in every 200 patients, which
amounts to approximately 4,000 cases in the United States
annually [6]. Bile duct injuries are usually repaired surgically [7,8].
The repair procedures are technically challenging, and therefore,
are best performed at institutions that specialize in care for patients
with bile duct injuries [9].
Surgical repair typically involves creation of a Roux-en-Y
choledochojejunostomy in patients with a healthy common bile
duct remnant, or a hepaticojejunostomy by connecting the
common hepatic or one of the branch ducts to the jejunum when
injuries are located at the liver hilum or involve one of the lobar or
segmental ducts. These reparative procedures currently offer the
best long-term results [10]. One of the most common complica￾tions resulting from surgical repair of laparoscopic cholecystecto￾my-related bile duct injuries is stricture formation at the biliary￾enteric anastomosis, which follows approximately 10% of surgical
repairs [11–13]. Traditionally, strictures at the biliary-enteric
anastomosis have been approached surgically. However, surgical
revision of the biliary-enteric anastomoses is complex due to build￾up of extensive scar tissue at the liver hilum, difficulty with
obtaining adequate exposure, and lack of adequate length of
healthy bile duct needed to construct a new anastomosis.
An alternate approach to management of biliary strictures
following surgical bile duct repair involves percutaneous transhe￾patic biliary drainage (PTBD) followed by dilation of strictures
with balloons. Ideally, this minimally-invasive option offers the
patient a quicker recovery and far less morbidity than surgery.
There is a paucity of available data that describes clinical
outcomes of patients with recurrent biliary strictures after surgical

repair of iatrogenic bile duct injuries treated with balloon dilation
[14–16]. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe long￾term effectiveness of balloon dilation in managing strictures arising
at the biliary-enteric anastomosis following surgical repair of bile
duct injuries.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This retrospective study was approved by the Committee on
Human Research of the Institutional Review Board at our
institution. The requirement for informed consent for participa￾tion in the study was waived. Between March 1995 and August
2010, 61 patients (40 women and 21 men; average age at referral
52.6 years; range 23–82 years) were referred to our institution for
management of biliary obstruction that developed at the biliary￾enteric anastomosis created for laparoscopic cholecystectomy￾related bile duct injuries. Based on the recommendation by the
treating hepatobiliary surgeon, 27 of these patients underwent
surgical revision, whereas 34 patients (23 women and 11 men;
average age at referral 53.4 years; range 28–82 years) were treated
with balloon dilation. A total of 20 patients had an injury to the
common hepatic duct (7 Bismuth type 1 and 13 Bismuth type 2),
while injuries at the liver hilum were sustained in 6 patients
(Bismuth type 3). Three patients had injuries to the right hepatic
duct (Bismuth type 4), and 3 patients had injuries to the aberrantly
inserting right posterior duct draining segments 6 and 7 of the liver
(Bismuth type 5). Location of injury could not be determined from
the available records in 2 patients [17]. Presence or absence of a
concomitant hepatic artery injury could not be ascertained based
on the available records.
Strictures at the biliary-enteric anastomosis occurred following
hepaticojejunostomy in 26 patients, choledochojejunostomy in 5
patients, or choledochoduodenostomy in 3 patients.. The mean
time to stricture formation after surgical repair was 2.3 years
(range 0–15.3 years). Mean total serum bilirubin level at time of
admission was 3.9 mg/dL (range 0.8–13.5 mg/dL; normal range
0.3–1.2 mg/dL). Symptoms at admission included jaundice, chills,
fever, abdominal pain, pruritus, weight loss and rigors. The
average follow-up period for the study population was 13.1 years
(median 11.8 years, range 1.9–17.4 years).
Study Objectives
The primary study objective was to determine the clinical
success rate of balloon dilation of biliary-enteric anastomotic
strictures following surgical repair of laparoscopic cholecystecto￾my-related bile duct injuries. Clinical success was defined as
resolution of biliary-enteric anastomotic stricture on tube cholan￾giogram (less than 30% residual narrowing at the biliary-enteric
anastomosis when compared to the caliber of the bile duct at the
cranial aspect of the anastomosis) associated with normalization of
serum bilirubin (if elevated) and elimination of pruritus or other
clinical symptoms (if present) allowing removal of the external
biliary catheter. Secondary study objectives were to (a) evaluate
patency of the anastomoses over time, (b) determine the rates of
stricture recurrence following a clinically successful balloon
dilation, and (c) analyze morbidity to patients associated with
treatment of biliary-enteric anastomotic strictures. Duration of
biliary-enteric anastomosis patency was defined as the time
between removal of the external biliary catheter till documentation
of stricture recurrence on a subsequent cholangiogram, a patient’s
death, or completion of the data analysis period (July 1, 2012).
Clinical signs of stricture recurrence included jaundice, pruritus,
abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, elevated serum
bilirubin, and evidence of new or worsening intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation on imaging (performed by contrast-enhanced CT
or MRI). Due to the retrospective nature of the analysis,
information on morbidity was based on the number of invasive
procedures performed in the interventional radiology suite or in
the operating room, the number of balloon dilation sessions or
surgical operations, time period spent with an indwelling biliary
catheter, number of hospitalizations for management of a bile
duct-related problem (i.e. cholangitis, hemobilia), and the number
and type of complications related to treatment.
The types of interventional radiology procedures tracked for the
study purposes included biliary drain injections with contrast (tube
check), PTBD exchanges, side-arm sheath cholangiograms, and
balloon dilation sessions. If multiple interventional radiology
procedures were performed on a given day, only the most
complex procedure was counted. The order of procedure
complexity increased from biliary drain injection with contrast
(i.e. tube check; least complex) to tube exchange over a guidewire,
to side-arm sheath cholangiogram (exchange of a biliary drain to a
side-arm sheath over a guidewire followed by cholangiogram
through the side-arm sheath; this procedure was performed to
assess anastomosis patency and was preceded all balloon dilations),
to balloon dilation (most complex). For example, if a patient had a
drain check followed by a side-arm sheath cholangiogram, balloon
dilation and PTBD replacement, the procedure was counted as
‘‘balloon dilation’’. The time period spent with an indwelling
biliary catheter was calculated from the day of PTBD insertion to
the day of tube removal (either following successful balloon
dilation or after surgical revision). Hospitalizations for bile duct￾related problems that occurred after PTBD insertion were tracked
as well.
Management of Biliary-Enteric Anastomotic Strictures
Upon referral to our institution, all patients first underwent
percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) followed by
placement of a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain (PTBD).
Subsequently, 34 patients were managed with balloon dilation.
Two patients were lost to follow-up (Figure 1).
Treatment algorithm for patients managed with balloon dilation
is summarized in Figure 2. Balloon dilation was performed at the
time of PTBD insertion or 3–14 days following drain placement.
Timing of the first balloon dilation session was at the discretion of
the treating interventional radiologist. Balloon dilation was
performed on the same day as PTBD only if duct catheterization
was technically straightforward. The first balloon dilation session
was performed with 6–10 mm diameter by 40 mm angioplasty
balloons (Boston Scientific, Natick MA; maximum inflation
pressure 10 atm). The duration of inflation was approximately
60 seconds. Maximum balloon diameter was selected based on the
caliber of the bile duct proximal to the anastomotic stricture.
Anastomotic patency following balloon dilation was defined as
greater than 70% of bile duct caliber proximal to the biliary￾enteric anastomosis on cholangiography. Following balloon
dilation, a 10.2 French internal-external biliary drainage catheter
(Cook Inc., Bloomington, IN) was left in place with catheter tip in
the Roux limb for a period of six weeks. At the completion of the
six-week interval, patients returned for a side-arm sheath
cholangiogram to assess patency of the biliary-enteric anastomosis.
Prior to 2002, if a persistent anastomotic narrowing greater than
30% of bile duct caliber was demonstrated on a follow-up
cholangiogram, balloon dilation of the biliary stricture was
repeated, as described above. Beginning in 2002, a repeat balloon
dilation was performed with an 8–10 mm by 40 mm high-pressure
balloon for 60 seconds (Conquest, Bard Inc., Murray Hill, NJ;

maximum inflation pressure 24 atm) in 15 patients. After 2005, if
anastomotic patency could not be restored with a high pressure
balloon, a 6–8 mm by 20 mm cutting balloon (Boston Scientific)
was used followed by repeat dilation with a larger diameter high￾pressure balloon up to 24 atm in 2 patients. Following balloon
dilation, the PTBD was replaced and was left in place for an
additional six weeks after each balloon dilation session. If the
anastomosis was found to be patent on the follow-up cholangio￾gram (less than 30% residual stenosis), a 10 French external biliary
drainage catheter (Malecot, Bard) was capped and left in place
above the stricture for a period of an additional two weeks. The
drainage catheter was removed if the repeat tube cholangiogram
demonstrated persistent patency of the anastomosis. Alternatively,
recurrent or residual anastomotic stricture was treated with repeat
balloon dilation (Figure 2).
At the beginning of the study period (1995–1999), patients were
referred for surgical revision of the biliary-enteric anastomosis if a
single attempt at balloon dilation of the anastomosis proved
unsuccessful. After 2000, patients were referred to surgery after
biliary strictures remained after two or more balloon dilation
sessions. After the biliary drain removal, patients were instructed
to return to their hepatobiliary surgeon at our institution if they
experienced any recurrent biliary obstruction symptoms (jaundice,
abdominal pain, fever, nausea, anorexia). Follow-up was conduct￾ed via a retrospective review of medical records and by searching
the Social Security Death Index.
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Sas version 9.2 software
(Sas Institute, Cary, IN). Continuous variables such as number of
interventional radiology procedures, number of balloon dilations,
maximum balloon diameter, time period with indwelling biliary
catheter, and number of hospitalizations were analyzed using
Student’s T-test. Discrete variables, such as the number of patients
who developed a recurrent stricture and individual complications
were compared using Fisher’s exact test. A p-value,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Out of 61 patients referred to our institution who had previously
underwent prior surgical repair for cholecystectomy-related bile
duct injuries, 34 (56%) were managed with balloon dilation, and
27 patients (44%) went directly to surgical revision. Two patients
treated with balloon dilation were lost to follow-up (Figure 1).
During the study period 17 patients were treated with a single
balloon dilation session, 11 patients underwent two balloon
dilations, and 4 patients underwent three dilation sessions. A total
of 15 patients with recalcitrant anastomotic strictures were treated
with high-pressure balloons, and 2 patients were treated with a
cutting balloon.

In 21 of the 32 patients (66%) balloon dilation proved to be
clinically successful at dilating the biliary-enteric anastomotic
stricture. Their clinical symptoms including jaundice, nausea, and
abdominal pain resolved; serum bilirubin levels decreased from
mean of 3.9 mg/dL (range 0.8–13.5 mg/dL) prior to PTBD to
mean of 0.7 mg/dL (range 0.3 to 1.1 mg/dL) at the time of drain
removal, while their tube cholangiograms demonstrated less than
30% residual anastomotic biliary stricture thus allowing for the
biliary drainage catheter to be removed. The remaining 11
patients were initially treated with balloon dilation, but this
approach was not successful in dilating the stricture after one (5
patients), two (4 patients), or three (2 patients) balloon dilation
sessions. Anastomotic strictures resistant to balloon dilation were
revised with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The decision when
to proceed to surgical revision was based on the referring surgeon’s
preference. Prior to 2000, our institution’s hepatobiliary surgeons
tended to perform surgical revision of the anastomosis following a
single unsuccessful dilation session, whereas after 2000 two or
more balloon dilation sessions were performed prior to resorting to
surgical revision.
Patients who were unsuccessfully managed with balloon dilation
required significantly more invasive procedures (6.8 v. 3.4;
p = 0.02) and were left with an indwelling biliary catheter for a
significantly longer period of time (8.8 v. 2.0 months; p = 0.02)
than patients whose strictures could be resolved by balloon
dilation. No significant differences in the number of balloon
dilations performed (p = 0.17) or in the maximum balloon
diameter used (p = 0.99) were demonstrated for patients with
successful or unsuccessful balloon dilation outcomes (Table 1).
After an average of 13.1 years of follow-up (range 1.9 to 17.4
years), recurrent stricture developed in one of the 21 (5%) patients
who underwent a successful biliary dilation five years following the
originally successful balloon dilation. This patient underwent a
repeat PTBD and a single session of balloon dilation, which led to
resolution of the recurrent stricture and has not required surgical
revision to date (a period of 16.5 months). Thus, none of the
patients who underwent a clinically successful balloon dilation
ultimately developed a stricture that required surgical revision of
the biliary-enteric anastomosis.
Discussion
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly
performed surgical procedures in the world, and as more of these
procedures are performed, the number of patients that have
sustained a bile duct injury caused by these operations has
increased as well. Surgical repair of the injured duct is associated
with a restricture rate of 10% to 30% [12,18,19]. These recurrent
strictures are notoriously difficult to manage due to development
of extensive scar tissue from prior surgeries at the liver hilum and
have a tendency to recur at high rates. One study showed that
68% of patients who underwent surgical revision of a stricture at
the biliary-enteric anastomosis following a Roux-en-Y hepaticoje￾junostomy developed recurrent strictures within 3 years of the
most recent repair, and 80% developed a recurrence within 5
years [11]. Another study noted that about 65% of patients
became symptomatic within 2 years of the last repair, and 90% of
patients developed symptoms of stricture recurrence within 7 years
[20]. The likely explanation for poor surgical outcome is that with
each additional operation, the adhesions and scar tissue accumu￾late and make the surgical revisions more challenging [21].
Despite the difficulty of this clinical problem, our results
demonstrate that the clinical success rate of balloon dilation was as
high as 66%. All patients except one who had a clinically
successful balloon dilation achieved lasting patency of the biliary￾enteric anastomosis.
Previous studies have explored the possible use of percutaneous
approaches to treating benign bile duct strictures, including those
resulting from failed surgical repair of bile duct injuries. A study by
Goykhman, et al. included 15 patients that developed biliary
strictures following surgical repair for both open and laparoscopic
cholecystectomy-related bile duct injuries, with 7 cases (47%)
being successfully managed with balloon dilation during a mean
follow up of 24 months [14]. Kocher, et al. described 21 patients
who underwent balloon dilation for benign anastomotic biliary
strictures that resulted from a variety of causes. Anastomotic
stricture resulting from repair of iatrogenic bile duct injury was the
disease etiology in 17 of the patients in that series. However, the
authors did not specifically analyze patient outcomes for anasto￾motic biliary strictures after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [15]. A
retrospective study by Misra et al. evaluated 51 patients who
underwent percutaneous balloon dilation for anastomotic biliary
strictures that developed following surgical repair of bile duct

injuries sustained during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 58.8%
of these patients were successfully treated (66% in our study)
during a mean follow up time of 76 months. Of those patients who
underwent a clinically successful balloon dilation, 76.7% did not
have any recurrence of symptoms, compared to 95% in our study
[16].
Our study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective
evaluation that encompasses all the problems associated with
retrospective data. Our study was limited to clinical information
contained in the medical records. Further evaluation with a
prospective randomized trial would be needed to validate our
findings. Secondly, there is the possibility that our records are not
complete, and that patients developed complications after balloon
dilation, but did not return to our institution. We think that
likelihood of this possibility is low, as all patients in our study
resided locally and could return to the care of their hepatobiliary
surgeon in the event of a complication. Thirdly, as the data set
encompassed patients treated over a 15-year period, the technical
standards for biliary stricture dilation have changed. Namely, after
the year 2000 it became standard practice to perform more than
one balloon dilation session at our institution if the first balloon
dilation session failed to result in biliary-enteric anastomosis
patency. Subsequently, in 2002 high-pressure non-compliant
balloons became available, and finally in 2005 the cutting balloons
were introduced into clinical practice. Due to the small number of
patients studied, it is difficult to determine whether incorporation
of these new methods and technologies into standard practice had
an impact on clinical outcomes. Our current institutional standard
is to perform two balloon dilation sessions. During the first dilation
session, a conventional balloon is used, whereas during the second
dilation session, recalcitrant strictures may be subjected to dilation
with a high-pressure balloon and/or a cutting balloon. If a
stricture cannot be resolved following two balloon dilation sessions,
the patient is referred for a surgical revision of the anastomosis.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that balloon dilation of
biliary-enteric strictures resulting from bile duct injury repair may
provide a lasting benefit and can prevent the need for a surgical
revision of the anastomosis. We recommend that balloon dilation
should be considered in patients with biliary-enteric anastomotic
strictures resulting from bile duct injury repair.
