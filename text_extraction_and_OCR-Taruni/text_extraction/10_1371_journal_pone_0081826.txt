Abstract
Background: Expanded criteria donors (ECDs) are currently accepted as potential sources to increase the donor pool and to
provide more chances of kidney transplantation for elderly recipients who would not survive long waiting periods.
Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is designed to mitigate the deleterious effects of simple cold storage (CS) on the
quality of preserved organs, particularly when the donor is in a marginal status.
Methods: We compared the transplant outcomes in patients receiving ECD kidneys with either HMP or CS graft
preservation. Articles from the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched and all studies reporting
outcomes from HMP versus CS methods of kidney preservation were included in this meta-analysis. The parameters
analyzed included the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), primary non-function (PNF) and one-year graft and patient
survival.
Results: A total of seven studies qualified for the review, involving 2374 and 8716 kidney grafts with HMP or CS preservation
respectively, all from ECD donors. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) was significantly reduced with an odd
ratio(OR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.54–0.66, P,0.001) and one-year graft survival was significantly improved with an OR of 1.12 (95%
CI 1.03–1.21, P = 0.005) in HMP preservation compared to CS. However, there was no difference in the incidence of PNF (OR
0.54, 95% CI 0.21–1.40, P = 0.20), and one-year patient survival (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94–1.02, P = 0.36) between HMP and CS
preservation.
Conclusions: HMP was associated with a reduced incidence of DGF and an with increased one-year graft survival, but it was
not associated with the incidence of PNF and one-year patient survival.

Introduction
Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients
with end-stage renal disease(ESRD) [1]. Because of a persistent
donor organ shortage, kidneys from expanded criteria donors
(ECDs) are currently accepted by many centers and have been
successfully transplanted to increase the donor pool [2,3], thereby
facilitating timely kidney transplantation for elderly recipients who
would not survive long waiting periods [4,5] ECDs are defined as
allografts from deceased donors older than 60 years of age and
those from donors aged 50–59 years old with at least two of the
followings characteristics: history of hypertension, serum creati￾nine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or cerebrovascular as the cause of
death[6]. Compared with standard criteria donor(SCD) kidneys,
kidneys from ECDs can be associated with a higher rate of delayed
graft function(DGF), primary non-function(PNF),acute rejection
and a more complicated postoperative course, resulting in inferior
long-term graft survival overall [7–10]. Although ECD kidneys
have an overall 1.7 times greater risk for graft failure [3], it has also
been shown that transplantation of these kidneys has a significant
survival benefit when compared with dialysis treatment[11],
especially for elderly recipients [12].
To maximize the benefit of donated kidneys, two kidney
preservation methods have been developed over the past 30 years,
namely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and static cold
storage (CS)[13]. Static cold storage, with solutions designed in the
1980s, remains the gold standard in kidney transplantation.
However, it has been reported that SC was unable to fully protect
ECD kidneys, while HMP could mitigate the deleterious effects of
CS, reducing the incidence of DGF for ECD kidney transplan￾tations [14,15].
To better understand whether HMP could obtain better
outcomes in ECD kidney transplantation compared to CS, We
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available
studies. We assessed the impact of HMP on rates of DGF, PNF
and one-year graft and patient survival. These data could help
clinical transplant professionals to decide the best way to preserve
ECD kidneys.

Materials and Methods
Data sources and searches
A search of the PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane
library databases was performed. The search strategies are listed in
Table 1, and the process of identifying papers for inclusion is
shown in Figure 1. The search was conducted in March and April
2013. A manual search of the references of the relevant
publications was also performed.
Selection criteria
Studies reporting outcomes of ECD kidney transplantation
using HMP preservation versus CS were included in this meta￾analysis. Exclusion criteria were: (1) overlapping studies from the
same institution (avoid duplication);(2) studies that included
kidneys from simultaneous kidney-pancreas (SKP)transplants and
simultaneous kidney-liver(SLK) transplants; (3) HMP or SC
solutions with additional drugs, e.g., PGE1;(4) study that contain
both ECD and other data, such as donation after cardiac death
(DCD), but ECD data cannot be separated apart;and (5) animal
studies, review articles, studies in languages other than English.
Quality assessment
The publications were reviewed and data were extracted by two
independent investigators with disagreements resolved through
discussion and consensus. The individual studies were evaluated
by the Downs and Black quality assessment method[16], which is a
list of 27 criteria for evaluating both randomized and nonrando￾mized comparative studies. Studies could divided into 5 different
aspects:reporting, external validity, bias, confounding and power
and reach a maximum of 24 points.
Data synthesis and analysis
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the event rates,
and the results were reported with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs).A P value ,0.05 was considered a significant difference
between the two groups. Heterogeneity in all of the included
studies was evaluated byX2 andI
2 statistical tests. A random effect
model was adopted when P,0.05 orI
2
.50%, and a fixed-effect
model was used when P.0.05 orI
2
,50%. However, taking into
account the presence of non-RCTs and different sample size of the
included studies, a sensitivity analysis was performed to compare
the incidence of DGF and PNF between HMP and CS
preservation. A funnel plot is designed to check the existence of
publication bias in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. All
statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager (Rev￾Man version 5.1, 2008. The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Rigshos￾pitalet).
Results
Search results and included studies
Based on the search strategies and selection criteria, we included
seven studies comparing HMP to CS in this review [5,17–22],
involving 2374 and 8716 kidney grafts with HMP and CS
preservation respectively, all from ECD donors. Of these seven
studies, two were randomized controlled trials(RCTs), one was a
prospective study, and four were retrospective studies. Two of the

studies were from Germany, one was from France, one was from
Sweden, while the remaining three were from the USA. The years
of publication spanned from 2006 to 2013. The study character￾istics are shown in Table 2, and the primary outcomes appear in
Table 3.
Quality of included studies
The results of the evaluation criteria adapted from Downs and
Black [16] are shown in Table 4. The scores were, on average,
16.7 points (SD = 3.0). The lowest score was 14 points[22],
whereas one study reached the highest score of 22 points[18].
Outcomes
All seven studies reported the incidence of DGF. All of the
studies defined DGF as the need for dialysis within the first week
post-transplant. Heterogeneity was evident but not statistically
significant among the studies (X2= 7.33,P = 0.29, I
2= 18%), thus a
fixed-effect model was adopted. The incidence of DGF was
significantly reduced in the HMP preservation compared with CS
(OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.54–0.66; P,0.001) (Figure 2). Due to
heterogeneity in study design and sample size, sensitivity analyses
were conducted using the two RCTs and larger sample size studies
respectively. Evaluating the two larger size studies [19,21],the
protective effect was still found with an OR of 0.60(95% CI 0.53–
0.66), with no heterogeneity(X2= 0.04,P = 0.84, I
2= 0%),fixed￾effect model. However, we found that the incidence of DGF was
not significantly different between HMP and CS preservation
using the two RCTs (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.46–1.17; P = 0.19)
(Figure 2).
Five studies reported the incidence of PNF after transplanta￾tion[5,17,18,20,21]. One study defined PNF as a permanent lack
of function of the allograft from the time of transplantation[5].
The other four studies did not provide a definition of PNF.
Heterogeneity was identified (X2= 11.45, P = 0.02; I
2= 65%), thus
a random-effect model was adopted. The incidence of PNF was
not significantly different between HMP and CS preservations
(OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.21–1.40; P = 0.20) (Figure 3). Due to
heterogeneity in sample size, a sensitivity analysis was conducted
using the smaller size studies. However, we found that the
incidence of PNF was significantly lower in HMP preservation
compared to CS, with an OR of 0.28(95% CI 0.12–0.63), with no
heterogeneity(X2= 0.69,P = 0.88, I
2= 0%),fixed-effect
model(Figure 3). The same three studies reported the incidence
one-year graft survival[5,17,18]. None of the study provided a
definition of one-year graft survival. There was no heterogeneity
(X2= 0.86,P = 0.65, I
2= 0%); thus, a fixed-effect model was
adopted. There was a trend favoring the use of HMP, the one￾year graft survival rate was significantly different between HMP
and CS preservation (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03–1.21; P = 0.005)
(Figure 4). The same three studies reported the incidence of one￾year patient survival[5,17,18]. None of the study provided a
definition of one-year patient survival. No heterogeneity was
identified (X2= 0.32, P = 0.85, I
2= 0%);thus, a fixed-effect model
was applied. However, the incidence of one-year patient survival

(OR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.94–1.02; P = 0.36) (Figure 5).
Publication bias
We took no formal steps to determine publication bias, such as
plotting effect sizes or calculating test statistics, because any formal
method would have had little power given the small number of
studies.
Discussion
The use of ECD kidneys in older patients has become a
common practice over the last decade, with recipients 50 years of
age and older receiving 70% of these kidneys[23]. HMP can
reduce warm-ischemia injury, and it provides an interesting
opportunity to evaluate kidney graft quality before transplanta￾tion[15]. Recently three meta-analyses compared HMP with cold
storage [24–26], finding that HMP could reduce the DGF rate,
but the PNF incidence and one-year graft and patient survival
rates were not different in patients using the two preservation
methods. However, these articles focused on normal kidney
donors, none of them was with regard to ECD kidney
transplantation.
This meta-analysis showed that HMP significantly reduced the
incidence of DGF, although the sensitivity analysis could not
determine a significant difference using only the RCTs. In the
multicenter RCT included in this meta-analysis, Treckmann, J et
al concluded that HMP significantly reduced the risk of DGF
compared with CS (OR 0.460, P = 0.047)[18]. No significant
difference could be drawn using the only 2 RCTs because the
sample size was small. DGF is an early indicator for organ quality
and preservation. In 2009, Cyril Moers et al conducted an RCT
using a paired design, in which both kidneys were from the same
donor, with one kidney undergoing HMP and the other CS; they
showed a significant reduction in the DGF rate of 26.5% in the
HMP preservation group compared with 20.8% in CS [27]. In a
retrospective single-center analysis of 141 ECD kidneys, Stratta et
al reported a remarkable reduction in the rate of DGF with HMP
preservation (11%) versus CS(37%)[11]. Schold et al. examined
the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) database

from 1994 to 2003, compared HMP with CS in ECD kidneys
transplantation and found that the rates of DGF were 20% with
HMP preservation and 28% in CS. The study also examined
paired transplanted kidneys, finding that HMP preservation
significantly decreased the DGF rate compared with CS (19%
vs. 26%, p,0.001) [28]. The incidence of DGF in ECD kidneys
differed in each study; one important reason for this might be the
length of cold ischemic times in each study [21,27]. Cold ischemia
time was a risk factor for DGF in ECD kidney transplants [29].
DGF was shown to be a risk factor for graft failure after kidney
transplantation[30].The sensitivity analysis found that HMP had a
protection effect in reducing the PNF rate using the smaller sample
size studies. However, Matsuoka, L et al [21] retrospectively
analyzed the data from United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS), which contained 4618 ECD kidneys, and found that
HMP could not decrease PNF rate compared to CS (2.6% versus
3.2%, p = 0.32).Taking the larger sample size study into account,
we found that HMP preservation could not improve primary non￾function(PNF)for recipients receiving HMP kidneys. Unlike other
meta-analysis[24–26],we found that HMP preservation could
improve one-year graft survival rate compared to CS preservation.
Polyak et al. found that one-year graft survival was greater with
ECD kidneys that were preserved by HMP compared with CS
(88% vs. 79%, p = 0.02)[31]. Treckmann, J et al. conducted an
international randomized controlled study and obtained similar
conclusion (92.3% vs. 80.2%, P = 0.02) [18].However, we found
that HMP preservation was not associated with improvement of
one-year patient survival. ECD kidneys often associated with
deteriorated function and more frequent DGF, but these factors
did not increase the mortality of the recipients[32].
A number of factors might have confounded the interpretation
of this meta-analysis. First, there was heterogeneity between study

design, sample size and the years covered. This meta-analysis
contained only two RCTs on this special subject. Although the
nonrandomized studies were subject to lower quality, which might
have resulted in an unbalanced selection of patients, they provided
the best evidence available on this subject. Second, the pump
parameters, such as perfusion pressure, type of perfusate used and
cold storage solution, varied and were not always clearly
reported(Table 2). Third, we observed that the recipient popula￾tions, the length of cold ischemic time and the use of
immunosuppressive agents were variable and that the heteroge￾neity observed in clinical trials was correlated with the habits and
preferences of individual institutions(Table 2).
Usage of HMP could reduce the discard rate of ECD kidneys
from 40% to 30%and decrease DGF risk for ECD kidneys with
longer cold ischemia time(.30 hours), minimizing postoperative
complications and maximizing organ utilization[28]. HMP also
provides a quantitative assessment of renal vasospasm due to the
pump parameters that are generated during machine preservation
[20]. In addition, rather than increasing direct costs to the
transplant program, HMP was correlated with lower costs for
transplant hospitalizations, likely due to the associated reduction in
DGF[19]. Go´mez, C conducted a cost-effectiveness assessment for
ECD kidney transplantation and found that the introduction of
HMP cost $505, however, $3,369 was savedin each DGF or PNF
case[33].
The meta-analysis demonstrates that HMP is associated with a
reduced incidence of DGF and increased one-year graft survival
rate compared to CS for ECD kidney transplantations, but it was
not associated with the incidence of PNF and one-year patient
survival.
