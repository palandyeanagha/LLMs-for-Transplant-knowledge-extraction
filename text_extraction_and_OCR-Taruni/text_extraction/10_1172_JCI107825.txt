A B S T R A C T We previously reported that putative
nuclear receptors for thyroid hormone can be demon￾strated by incubation of hormone either with intact
GH1 cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line, or with iso￾lated GH1 cell nuclei and rat liver nuclei in vitro.
We characterized further the kinetics of triiodothyro￾nine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) binding and the biochem￾ical properties of the nuclear receptor after extraction
to a soluble form with 0.4 M KCI. In vitro binding of
[lI]T3 and ['I]T4 with GH1 cell and rat liver nu￾clear extract was examined at 0C and 370C. Equilib￾rium was attained within 5 min at 370C and 2 h at 0C.
The binding activity from GH1 cells was stable for
at least 1 h at 370C and 10 days at - 200C. Chroma￾tography on a weak carboxylic acid column and in￾activation by trypsin and Pronase, but not by DNase
or RNase, suggested that the putative receptor was a
nonhistone protein. The estimated equilibrium disso￾ciation constants (Kd) for hormone binding to the
solubilized nuclear binding activity was 1.80 x 10-10 M
(T3) and 1.20 X 10" M (T4) for GH1 cells and 1.57
X 10`" M (T3) and 2.0 X 10' M (T4) for rat liver.
These Kd values for T3 are virtually identical to those
which we previously reported with isolated rat liver
nuclei and GH1 cell nuclei in vitro.
The 10-fold greater affinity for T3 compared to T4
in the nuclear extract is also identical to that ob￾served with intact GH1 cells. In addition, the ['I]T3
and ['I]T4 high-affinity binding in the nuclear extract
were inhibited by either nonradioactive T3 or T4,
which suggests that the binding activity in nuclear
extract was identical for T3 and T4.

Received for publication 28 February 1974 and in revised
form 5 June 1974.
In contrast, the binding activity for T4 and T3 in
GHi1 cell cytosol was markedly different from that ob￾served with nuclear extract (Kd values were 2.87 X
10' M for T4 and 1.13 X 10' M for T3).
Our results indicate that nuclear receptors for T3
and T4 can be isolated in a soluble and stable form
with no apparent change in hormonal affinity. This
should allow elucidation of the mechanisms of thyroid
hormone action at the molecular level.
INTRODUCTION
The thyroid hormones regulate a wide variety of bio￾logical processes in virtually all tissues of higher or￾ganisms (1). Because of the significant effect of L￾thyroxine (T4) 1 and L-triiodothyronine (T3) on stim￾ulating tissue oxygen consumption, the mitochondria
was long thought to be the primary locus of action of
the thyroid hormones (2). The observations that the
thyroid hormones play an important role in mammalian
cell differentiation and growth, (3) and in amphibian
metamorphosis (4) support the concept that the diverse
biologic effects of these hormones may result from a
primary effect on the control of gene expression (5).
We have previously reported that T3 and T4 induced
a threefold increase in the rate of growth of GH1
cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line, in culture (6). This
effect occurred at physiologic hormone levels, and the
estimated free hormone concentrations inducing a half-

maximal biologic effect were 0.8 X 10' M for T3 and
1 X 10' M for T4 (6). Studies on the binding of
[5I]T3 and ['5I]T4 after incubation of hormone with
intact cells demonstrated high-affinity saturable binding
sites in the cell nucleus (7, 8). The estimated equilib￾rium dissociation constants (Kd) were 2.9 X 10' M
for T3 and 2.5 X 10' M for T4 (7, 8). These affinities
were sufficiently similar to the hormone concentrations
that induced a half-maximal biologic effect to suggest
that these nuclear binding activities functioned as
receptors for the thyroid hormones.
This description of high-affinity saturable nuclear
binding sites for the thyroid hormones in GH1 cells
is similar in nature to the observations of Oppen￾heimer, Koerner, Schwartz, and Surks after injection
of ['lI]T3 into intact rats (9).
We first reported that putative nuclear receptors
for thyroid hormone could be demonstrated in vitro by
incubation of ['I]T3 directly with isolated nuclei of
GH1 cells (7, 8) and rat liver (10). The estimated Kd
for ['I]T3 binding in vitro was 1.65 X 10-" M for
GH1 cell nuclei and 2.1 X 10-" M for rat liver nuclei
(10). The total number of estimated T3 binding sites
per nucleus (8,000), determined in vitro with GH1 cell
nuclei and rat liver nuclei, were also identical to that
determined by incubation of ['I]T3 with intact GH1
cells (10). This suggested that [1I]T3 associated with
the same nuclear binding moiety in whole cells as with
isolated rat liver and GH1 cell nuclei in vitro.
Surks, Koerner, Dillman, and Oppenheimer reported
that after injection of ['I]T3 into rats the hormone
that bound to nuclear sites in vivo could be dissociated
as a hormone-macromolecular complex with 0.4 M
KCI (11). These investigators reported that the nuclear
binding activity determined after in vivo injection of
['1I]T3 was a nonhistone protein (11). The nuclear
binding activity once dissociated from nuclei, however,
did not associate with ['5I]T3 in vitro (11).
We have extended our in vitro studies and have re￾cently reported that ['I] T3 can associate with satu￾rable binding sites in nuclear extracts of GH1 cells, rat
liver, and kidney in vitro (12). In this paper, we
characterized the in vitro kinetics and affinity of T3
and T4 binding and the biochemical properties of the
putative nuclear receptors after extraction to a soluble
form with 0.4 M KCI. Our results indicate that nu￾clear receptors for T3 and T4 can be isolated in a
soluble and stable form and associate with thyroid hor￾mone in vitro with no apparent change in hormonal
affinity.
METHODS
Hormone analysis and purification. [lI]T3 (initial sp
act, 355 Ci/mmol) and ['I]T4 (initial sp act, 755 Ci/
mmol) were obtained from the Research Division, Abbott
Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill. All radioactive analysis
was determined with a gamma spectrometer. The purity of
these compounds was examined by elution chromatography
with Sephadex G-25 (fine) as previously described (8, 13).
The columns, 0.9X20 cm, were equilibrated with 0.015 N
NaOH-0.5 M NaCl, and 0.3-0.5 ml of hormone solution in
0.1 N NaOH was applied to the column and then eluted
over a 3-h period with 0.1 N NaOH-5 mM NaCl at 250C.
VAlith this separation procedure, iodide eluted within one
column volume, T3 eluted within the second column volume,
and T4 eluted in the third column volume. The ['I] T3
contained 1.5% iodide and no T4. The [HI]T4 contained
96.2% T4, 2.3% iodide, and 1.5% T3. The [(I]T4 was
purified by two successive paper chromatographic procedures
and used immediately after the last elution (14). After
paper chromatography, the [I]T4 was examined with the
Sephadex G-25 method and was found to be contaminated
with less than 0.4% [II]T3. The purity of the nonradio￾active T3 and T4 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.)
was examined by specific radioimmunoassay (6, 15). The
T4 was contaminated by T3 (1.6%) and was purified by
paper chromatography (14) to decrease the extent of T3
contamination to less than 0.2%. The T3 contained no T4
contamination.
Cell suspensions and media. GH1 cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.
The cells were routinely grown in 95% air, 5% C02, with
Ham's F-10 media supplemented to 15% with horse serum
and to 2.5% with fetal calf serum (Grand Island Biological
Co., Grand Island, N. Y.), as previously described (6).
To prepare for hormone binding studies, the media of
cell cultures in the late logarithmic phase of growth was
replaced with Ham's F-10 media supplemented to 10% with
hypothyroid calf serum obtained from a thyroidectomized
calf, Rockland Farms, Gilbertsville, Pa. (6). The cell cul￾tures were then incubated for an additional 36-48 h to
deplete the cells of thyroid hormone (6). This was docu￾mented by incubating GH1 cells with media containing
euthyroid concentrations of [lI]T3 or [lUI]T4 for 2 days
followed by a second incubation for 36-48 h with media
containing 10% hypothyroid calf serum. The second incu￾bation depleted the whole cells as well as the nuclei of 90%o
of the associated hormone.
Preparation of GHt cell nuclei and cytosol. The mono￾layer cultures were harvested with the aid of a rubber
policeman and were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The
cell pellet was then washed three times with 10 ml of
serum-free Ham's F-10 medium by repeated dispersion and
centrifugation. All further procedures were carried out at
0-40C. The final cell pellet was homogenized in 10 vol of
STM buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris, 1.1 mM MgCl2,
pH 7.85, at 250C) by 15 strokes at 5,000 rpm with a
motorized pestle (Tri-R Instruments, Inc., Rockville Centre,
N. Y.). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 800 g for
10 min. The homogenate supernate was centrifuged at 105,-
000 g for 90 min to prepare the cytosol fraction. Occasion￾ally a top layer of lipid-like material was present after
centrifugation. This was discarded, and the clear cytosol
was stored at 4VC before use. The original homogenate
pellet was used to prepare nuclei by two successive suspen￾sions and centrifugations (800 g for 10 min) in at least
10 vol of STM-Triton buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM
Tris, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.85, at 25°C).
Triton X-100 was obtained from the Packard Instrument
Co., Inc., Downers Grove, Ill. GH1 cell nuclei, prepared by
854 H. H. Samuels, J. S. Tsai, J. Casanova, and F. Stanley

the use of Triton X-100, contained less than 1% intact cells
and were free of cytoplasmic contamination as estimated
by phase contrast microscopy and staining with aceto-orcein.
The high affinity saturable nuclear binding activity for T3
was not altered by isolation with Triton X-100, and the
magnitude of saturable binding was similar to nuclei isolated
by centrifugation with 2.2 M sucrose (8). The isolated
GHL cell nuclei had a protein/DNA ratio of approximately
2.0 and an RNA/DNA ratio of approximately 0.25. In
contrast, the protein/DNA ratio of whole cells was 10.0,
and the RNA/DNA ratio was 2.0. The yield of nuclei was
approximately 80-90%o as estimated by DNA determination.
Protein, DNA, and RNA were determined as previously
described (16, 17, 18). 1,000,000 GH1 cells contain 13.0 lig
DNA.
Preparation of rat liver nuclei. Rat liver nuclei were
prepared from hypothyroid Sprague-Dawley rats as previ￾ously described (10). Male rats, thyroidectomized approxi￾mately 8-12 wk before the study, were killed by subluxation
of the cervical spine. Approximately 0.3-0.5 g of liver was
excised, minced in 4VC STM buffer, homogenized in at
least 10-15 vol of STM buffer at 5,000 rpm, and then
centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. The homogenate pellet was
suspended in STM-Triton buffer with a loose pestle at
2,000-3,000 rpm and centrifuged again. This treatment with
STM-Triton buffer was repeated two additional times. This
procedure prepared rat liver nuclei free of cytoplasmic
contamination and intact cells as determined by phase con￾trast microscopy and aceto-orcein staining (10). The rat
liver nuclei had a protein/DNA ratio of approximately 3.0
and an RNA/DNA ratio of approximately 0.35 (10, 19).
This compares to whole liver in which the protein/DNA ratio
was approximately 30, and the RNA/DNA ratio was 3.8.
Conditions for solubilizing the nuclear-binding activity.
To determine the optimal salt concentration for dissociation
of the thyroid hormone binding activity from nuclei, intact
GH1 cells were incubated with ['I]T3 (1 X 10-1° M) with
and without a 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive T3
as previously described (8). After a 2-h incubation, the
nuclei were prepared as described above. Expressed per
100 ,ug DNA, the nuclei prepared from cells incubated with
[lzI]T3 bound 80 X 10-1 mol of ['I]T3, and those pre￾pared from cells incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of
nonradioactive T3 bound 6.7 X 10' mol of ['I]T3. The
nuclei were then incubated at 0°C in 2.0 ml of extraction
buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 5.0
mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.85, at 25°C) and KCl ranging
from 0.10 to 1.0 M. The nuclear suspensions were gently
agitated every 5 min for 15 min and were then centrifuged
at 6,000 g for 15 min. The results of the extraction are
illustrated in Fig. 1.
The extent of extraction of ['5I]T3 from nuclei prepared
from cells that were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess
of nonradioactive T3 was approximately 10% of the total
bound ['5I]T3 at concentrations of KCl varying from 0.14
to 1.0 M. Application and elution of the [WI] T3 with
Sephadex G-25 (fine) columns as described below indicated
that the hormone was unassociated with a macromolecule.
In contrast, the T3 bound to nuclei prepared from cells
incubated with only [I] T3 extracted readily with in￾creasing KCl concentrations with approximately 60-65% of
the total bound T3 extracted by KCl concentrations of 0.4
M or greater. Application and elution of these KCl ex￾tracts on Sephadex G-25 (fine) columns indicated that of
the [MI] T3 in the extract, approximately 85-90% was in
a bound form.

KCI Concentration (molarity)
FIGURE 1 Extraction of bound ['-I] T3 from nuclei with
KC1. GHL cells (1 X 10') were incubated in 10 ml of serum￾free Ham's F-10 media with 1 X 10' M ['I]T3 and with
I X 10' M ['I] T3 plus a 100-fold molar excess of non￾radioactive T3. After a 2-h incubation at 370C, the nuclei
were isolated and then incubated with extraction buffer
containing various concentrations of KC1. The results re￾flect the percent extraction of total bound [PI] T3. The
total ['I]zT3 bound was 80 X 10' mol/100 gug DNA after
incubation with 1 X 101 M [II] T3, and 6.7 X 10' mol/100
.ug DNA when incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of
nonradioactive T3.
The concentration chosen for extraction of the binding
activity from GH1 cell nuclei was 0.4 M KCl. This con￾centration permitted significant extraction of the nuclear
binding activity, and the pellet formed after centrifugation
was tightly packed. Higher KCI concentrations resulted in
the formation of a viscous pellet which made separation of
the supernate and pellet difficult. The binding activity was
prepared from rat liver nuclei by using 0.4 M KC1 with
extraction buffer as described for GH1 cell nuclei. There
was no observed difference in the magnitude of extracted
nuclear binding activity when the extract was centrifuged at
6,000 g for 15 min or at 150,000 g for 3 h. This suggested
that the nuclear binding activity was in a soluble form.
It remained possible that the binding activity was being
extracted from some whole cells or cytoplasmic elements
which contaminated the nuclear preparation. In order to
further exclude this possibility, we prepared nuclei with
the method utilizing Triton X-100 and then centrifuged the
nuclear preparation thru 2.2 M sucrose at 40,000 g for 1 h
(8). With this procedure, any whole cells and nonnuclear
cellular material would remain at the upper interface while
only nuclei sediment to the bottom of the tube. Extraction
of the nuclear pellet and the small amount of material in
the upper phase with 0.4 M KC1 and subsequent determina￾tion of binding activity as described below indicated that the
thyroid hormone binding activity was extracted from nuclei
rather than from whole cells or nonsoluble cytoplasmic
elements. Incubation of nuclei with 0.4 M KCl extracted
approximately 25-30% of the total nuclear protein and less
than 2.0% of nuclear DNA and RNA.

nuclear extract in vitro. Nuclei prepared from approxi￾Thyroid Hormone Binding with Solubilized Nuclear Receptors In Vitro 855

mately 1 X 10' GH1 cells or 0.3-0.5 g of rat liver was
incubated with 5.0 ml of extraction buffer (final KCl con￾centration, 0.4 M) at 00C, and the extract was prepared as
described above. The incubation mixture contained 25-100
Aig of extracted nuclear protein, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.25 M
KCl, 20 mM Tris, 1.1 MgCl2, 2.0 mM NaEDTA, 5.0 mM
dithiothreitol, pH 7.85, at 250C in vol of 0.4 ml. [5I]T3
or ['I]T4 was added alone as well as in the presence of a
molar excess (100-250-fold) of nonradioactive hormone in
0.05 ml of STM buffer. The incubations were carried out
at 00C or at 370C for various time intervals as indicated
in the text. The magnitude of "specific" saturable hormone
binding at a specific [1"5I]hormone concentration was con￾sidered to be that which was inhibited by the molar excess
of nonradioactive hormone. Extraction buffer containing no
nuclear extract served as a control.
The specificity of saturable hormone binding was ex￾amined by using 75 ,ug of crystaline bovine serum albumin
and 75 gg of calf thymus type 11-A histone (Sigma Chemi￾cal Co.), which contains all histone fractions.
Binding of ["'I] T3 and ["..I] T4 to GH, cell cytosol in
vitro. Binding of ['"I]T3 and ['I]T4 with GH1 cell cyto￾sol was determined as described for the 0.4 M KCl nuclear
extract, except that 25-100 ,tg of cytosol protein and no
KC1 was used in the incubation mixture. The binding re￾action was studied at 0C.
Separation of bound and free hormone. For studies
with nuclear extract or cytosol at 0 C, the bound and free
['"I]hormone were quantitated after separation at 40C on
0.9 X 4.0-cm columns (2.5 ml) of Sephadex G-25 (fine)
preswollen with STM buffer at 37°C. The entire sample
was applied to the column and then eluted with 1.5 ml of
00C STM buffer to separate the bound and free hormone.
The separation was simplified by the fact that the free
hormone rapidly binds to Sephadex (12, 13) which permits
easy separation of the hormone bound to the nuclear or
cytosol binding activity. The eluted bound hormone and the
free hormone that remained on the column were quanti￾tated with a gamma spectrometer. Trichloroacetic acid
(0.5 ml of 3.0 M) was added to the eluted bound hormone
fraction to precipitate protein. The eluted sample was then
centrifuged at 8,000 g for 20 min to collect the protein pre￾cipitate for quantitation (16). Approximately 90% of the
protein applied to the column was recovered in the eluted
fraction. With control samples containing only extraction
buffer, less than 0.4% of the '1I radioactivity in the incuba￾tion mixture was eluted by 1.5 ml of STM buffer. The
percent of the total counts eluted (0.2-0.4%o) with the
control buffer sample was constant for each experiment
and remained linearly proportional to the [HI] hormone
concentration. At concentrations of ['I] hormone below
1 X 10' M, the magnitude of the "2I radioactivity eluted in
the control buffer sample was insignificant when compared
to the eluted bound hormone. For example, with a concen￾tration of ['IIT3 or ['I]T4 of 1 X 10' M, the incubation
mixture contained 4.5 X 10-'3 mol hormone/0.45 ml. If 0.2%
of the total radioactivity were eluted in the buffer control,
this would be equivalent to 0.9 X 10' mol hormone. By using
Sephadex G-25 (fine), the addition of nonradioactive hor￾mone to the ['"I]hormone had no effect on the magnitude
of elution of [MI]radioactivity either with the buffer con￾trol or with incubation mixtures containing bovine serum
albumin or histone.
It should be noted that the magnitude of bound hormone
is an estimated value and might vary depending on the
method of separation of bound and free hormone. The
Sephadex column method for estimation of bound hormone
can be utilized if the chromatography procedure does not
result in the dissociation of bound hormone. Since the dis￾sociation rate of the hormone-receptor complex is ex￾tremely slow at 0C (Fig. 7), it seems unlikely that elution
of bound hormone on Sephadex columns at 0°C would
result in the dissociation of bound hormone. This was con￾firmed experimentally, in that the magnitude of bound
hormone was identical if the sample was eluted 1 or 30
min after application to the column. This indicates that the
Sephadex column environment does not appear to enhance
the dissociation of bound ["IJ] T3 and that the method
likely gives a valid indication of the magnitude of bound
hormone in the incubation mixture.
For kinetic studies of binding and dissociation at 370C,
separation of bound from free hormone was determined as
described for incubations at 0°C, except that Sephadex
G-25 (coarse) was used. This permitted rapid application
of the sample to the column bed. After incubation at 370C,
the sample was placed in an ice bath for 45 s and then
applied to a Sephadex G-25 (coarse) column at 4VC. The
sample permeated the gel bed in approximately 30-45 s.
The free hormone rapidly bound to the column, and at the
temperature of 0-4°C, dissociation of macromolecular bound
hormone occurred at an extremely slow rate (Fig. 7),
which permitted an estimation of the extent of binding at
37'C. With control samples containing only extraction
buffer, 1.0-1.5% of the total '5I radioactivity was eluted by
1.5 ml of STM buffer if the Sephadex G-25 (coarse) col￾umns were prepared at least 2-4 h before use and the flow
rate was no greater than 1.5 ml/min. Occasionally for un￾known reasons, unlike Sephadex G-25 (fine), a higher
percent of radioactivity eluted with extraction buffer con￾taining ['5I]hormone compared to that which also con￾tained a molar excess of nonradioactive hormone. Therefore,
before use in a binding experiment, the percent of '5I radio￾activity eluted with [5I]hormone, as well as with a molar
excess of nonradioactive hormone, was examined. The Se￾phadex G-25 (coarse) columns were used only if the eluted
counts were identical.
Calculation of high-affinity and low-affinity hormone bind￾ing. The 'I radioactivity eluted after incubation with
nuclear extract or cytosol with a ['MI]hormone concentra￾tion reflects binding to specific high-affinity saturable bind￾ing sites, "non-specific" low-affinity nonsaturable binding
sites and unbound "2I radioactivity which elutes from the
column reflected by the buffer control.
The total hormone bound (high-affinity as well as low￾affinity) was determined by subtracting the ['I] hormone
eluted with the buffer control containing an identical hor￾mone concentration. The extent of [1"JI]hormone bound to
low-affinity nonsaturable sites was calculated by first de￾termining the magnitude of ['SI]hormone binding in the
presence of 200-250-fold molar excess of nonradioactive
hormone and then subtracting the "I radioactivity eluted
with a control sample containing only buffer with an identi￾cal ['MI] hormone concentration. Higher concentrations of
nonradioactive hormone had no effect on the estimated
magnitude of low-affinity hormone binding.
The magnitude of specific high-affinity hormone binding
was calculated by subtracting the low-affinity binding from
the total hormone bound at a specific ['5I]hormone con￾centration. Alternatively, the magnitude of specific high￾affinity binding can also be determined without calculation
of the low-affinity binding or the radioactivity eluted with
the buffer control by determining the extent of inhibition
856 H. H. Samuels, J. S. Tsai, J. Casanova, and F. Stanley

of [125I] hormone binding by a molar excess of nonradio￾active hormone.
The magnitude of low-affinity [L2J]hormone binding was
linearly proportional to protein content and hormone con￾centration. At hormone concentrations less than 1 X 10-9 M,
the magnitude of low-affinity binding was less than 10%
of the magnitude of high-affinity saturable binding. At the
highest ['I]hormone concentration, e.g. 7.5 X 10' M ['SI]-
T4, the low-affinity binding accounted for 50% of the eluted
['I]T4. Therefore, for estimation of Kd, the extent of low￾affinity binding was determined and subtracted from the total
hormone bound to determine the magnitude of high-affinity
saturable hormone binding. This value was used in the
estimation of the Kd by the method of Scatchard (20).
Analysis of the "85I radioactivity bound to the nuclear
e.ttract and cytosol in vitro. The nature of the 'I radio￾activity bound to the nuclear extract and cytosol was ex￾amined after incubation with [1I]T3 and [zI]T4 in vitro.
The sample was brought to 0.1 N NaOH and then chro￾matographed with Sephadex G-25 (fine) as described in
the section on Hormone Analysis and Purification.
The results indicated that with ['-I] T3, the bound "2I
radioactivity was greater than 98% [HI] T3, and with
['I]T4, the bound radioactivity was greater than 97%
['SI]T4. In addition, a similar analysis of the total cytosol
and nuclear extract incubation mixtures after a 2-h incu￾bation at 0C demonstrated no deiodination of ['SI]T3 or
conversion of ['I]T4 to [HI] T3. Therefore, the binding
observed with ['I]T4 represented T4 binding and not T3
binding as a result of conversion of T4 to T3.
Sensitivity of the nuclear extract binding activity to 1n￾zymic degradation. The sensitivity of the nuclear binding
activity to enzymic degradation was determined with the
incubation mixture described with the standard binding
assay, along with ["2I] T3 (5 X 10" M), as well as with
a 200-fold molar excess of nonradioactive T3. GH1 cell
nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 37'C with
either 150 U deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase) (3,100 U/mg),
150 U ribonuclease A (RNase) (3,000 U/mg), 10 U tryp￾sin (197 U/mg), or 2.25 U Pronase (45 proteolytic U/mg).
DNase, RNase, and trypsin, all derived from bovine pan￾creas, were obtained from the Worthington Biochemical
Corp., Freehold, N. J., and the Pronase was obtained from
Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif. Extraction buffer and GHL
cell nuclear extract which received no enzyme served as
controls. After incubation at 37'C the samples were trans￾ferred to an ice bath for 1 h, and then the bound and free
hormone were quantitated as described with G-25 (fine)

['I] T3 in the 0.4 M KCl extract was bound to a histone
or nonhistone protein, the bound ['I]T3 was chromato￾graphed at 0C on a weak carboxylic acid column of Bio￾Rex 70 (200-400 mesh, sodium form) by the method of
van den Broek, Nooden, Sevall, and Bonner (21). By elu￾tion at different NaCl concentrations, this procedure can
separate histones from nonhistone nuclear proteins. Bio-Rex
70 was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
Calif.
After incubation of the 0.4 M KCl extract with ['I]T3
(2 X 10's M), the bound T3 was separated from the free
T3 on a 0.9 X 4.0-cm Sephadex G-25 column (fine) that
was equilibrated with 0.4 M NaCl-10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, at
25'C. The eluted sample was applied to a 0.9 X 5.0-cm
Bio-Rex 70 column that was equilibrated with 0.4 M NaCl-

RESULTS
Binding of [125I] T3 with nuclear extract, albumin,
and histone. Fig. 2 compares the binding at 0°C of
['wI]T3 (5 X 10-1° M) with and without a 200-fold
molar excess of nonradioactive T3 to GH1 cell and rat
liver nuclear extract, as well as bovine serum albumin
and histone. Saturable hormone binding was only de￾tected with the nuclear extracts. This illustrates a
specificity of hormone binding with nuclear extract
and that saturable T3 binding does not represent a gen￾eral type of interaction with protein at this ['JI]T3
concentration.

nuclear binding activity is a protein moiety.
Chromatography of the solubilized GH1 cell nuclear
binding activity on Bio-Rex 70. Previous studies indi￾cated that incubation of nuclei with 0.4 M KCl disso￾ciated predominately nonhistone nuclear proteins and
only a part of the lysine-rich histone fraction (22).
Surks et al. reported that the binding activity extracted
after nuclear binding of [MI] T3 in vivo was a non￾histone protein (11). This was based on a greater de￾gree of extractability from nuclei at pH 8.5 compared
to pH 6.0 and relatively less inactivation by trypsin
compared to chymotrypsin and Pronase (11).
To examine the nature of the thyroid hormone nu￾clear binding activity in vitro, we chromatographed the
binding activity after association with ['I]T3 in vitro
on a weak carboxylic acid column of Bio-Rex 70 (21).
Nonhistone proteins elute from the column with 0.4 M
NaCl, and histones elute at 1.0 M NaCl. Fig. 4 illus￾trates that 0.4 M NaCl eluted a coincident ['I]T3 peak
and protein peak. Application and elution of the radio￾active peak on Sephadex G-25 (fine) columns indi￾cated that the [2I]T3 maintained its association with
the binding activity. A protein or radioactive peak was
not detected after elution of the column with 1.0 M
NaCl. A similar study using 0.4 M KCl nuclear extract
prepared after incubation of ['I]T3 with intact cells
showed identical results. These studies indicated that
the binding activity determined both in vitro and
after incubation of hormone with intact cells was likely
not a histone protein. This observation, along with
the fact that the binding activity was inactivated by
trypsin and Pronase but not by DNase or RNase,
suggested that the nuclear binding activity is a non￾histone protein.
Time-course of binding of ["I] T3 to nuclear ex￾tract in vitro. Fig. 5 illustrates the time-course of
binding of [E5I]T3 (5 X 10° M) with the nuclear
extract of GH1 cells at 00C. The binding of [zI]T3 in
the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of nonradio￾active T3 markedly inhibited ['I]T3 binding. The
extent of inhibition by nonradioactive T3 reflects the
magnitude of saturable binding at this [MI] T3 con￾centration. The time-course of binding of ['NI]T4 was
similar to that observed for [zI]T3, and the binding
kinetics of [JI]T3 and ['SI]T4 were also similar with
rat liver nuclear extract at 0C. The magnitude of
['I]T3 binding after 20 h of incubation was vir￾tually identical to the 100-min incubation value in

2 h at 0°C. The bound ['I] T3 was separated from the free

with 0.4 M NaCl-10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, at 25°C. The eluted

of Bio-Rex 70, as described in Methods. Over 90% of the
radioactivity applied to the Bio-Rex column was recovered,
and subsequent application of the ['I]T3 eluted from the
Bio-Rex column on Sephadex G-25 (fine) columns indi￾cated that the [OI]T3 remained associated to the binding
activity.

Fig. 6 illustrates the time-course of binding of
[2I]T3 (2 X 10-0 M) with nuclear extract of GHi
cells at 370C. Binding of T3 occurred very rapidly, and
equilibrium was attained within 5 min of incubation.
The magnitude of the ["I]T3 binding remained con￾stant during the 1 h incubation at 370C. This indicated
that the nuclear binding activity was relatively stable
at 370C under the conditions of incubation. The solu￾bilized nuclear binding activity from GH1 cells was
also stable for at least 2 wk when stored at - 20'C. In
addition, the magnitude of [JI]T3 saturable binding
was identical if the GH1 cell nuclear extract was incu￾bated for 2 h at 00C or first incubated at 370C for 15
min and then for an additional 2 h at 00C. This indi￾cated that [MI]T3 associated with the same binding
activity at both incubation temperatures.
In contrast, the binding of ['I]T3 with nuclear ex￾tract of rat liver demonstrated somewhat different bind￾ing kinetics. The binding of [MI] T3 also attained
equilibrium within 5 min of incubation at 370C but
decreased to 60% of the 5-min value after 60 min of
incubation. This suggested that some proteolytic ac￾tivity was present in the rat liver extract but not in
GH1 cell nuclear extract.

indicated on the figure, T3 was added in 5 A4 of STM
buffer to achieve a 100-fold molar excess of nonradio￾active hormone. This rapidly decreased the specific
activity of the free ['I]T3 and limited detectable re￾association of [I]T3 to saturable binding sites, per￾mitting the detection of the dissociation of bound
['I]T3. At 0°C, no significant dissociation was noted
during the 80 min incubation after addition of non￾radioactive T3. Further incubation demonstrated a
half time of dissociation of 14 h at 0°C. This indi￾cated that the binding determined after 100 min of in￾cubation (Fig. 5) represented an equilibrium value,
since no further binding occurred after 20 h of incuba￾tion, during which time a significant exchange of
bound hormone occurs. In contrast, at 37°C, the disso￾ciation rate was extremely rapid with virtually com￾plete dissociation of the ['I]T3 bound to saturable
sites within 5 min of incubation. The magnitude of
['I]T3 binding 5 min after addition of nonradioactive

determined as described in Methods. At time zero, T3 was
added in 5 pl of STM buffer to achieve a 100-fold molar

a 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive T3 at the begin￾ning of the experiment. The magnitude of low-affinity

termined 5 min after addition of nonradioactive T3
reflects association with low affinity nonspecific binding
sites. Addition of 5 A of STM buffer without T3 to
control samples had no effects on the magnitude of
bound ['I]T3.
The very slow dissociation rate at 0C suggests that
the binding of ['I]T3 observed with GH1 cell nuclear
extract after a 2-h incubation reflects binding of hor￾mone to nuclear sites unoccupied before nuclear isola￾tion. In contrast, binding of ['I]T3 at 370C should
estimate the total number of binding sites, those un￾occupied and those occupied before nuclear isolation,
due to the rapid rates of association and dissociation.
As mentioned previously, an identical number of satu￾rable ['I]T3 binding sites was determined if the GH,
cell nuclear extract was incubated either for 2 h at
0C or first incubated at 370C for 15 min and then
for an additional 2 h at 0C. This is probably due to
the fact that the cells were depleted of thyroid hormone
with hypothyroid calf serum and the nuclear binding
sites were unoccupied with hormone before nuclear
isolation.

are illustrated in Fig. 8 and indicate a linear relation￾ship of saturable hormone binding to the protein con￾tent of the nuclear extract.
Estimation of the Ks for ['"I] T3 and [15.I] T4 binding

isolated rat liver nuclei (10). The estimated Ks for T3
binding with isolated nuclei was similar at 0 and 370C.'

to minimize proteolytic activity in the rat liver nuclear
extract in order to compare the hormonal affinities with
those of GH, cell nuclear extract.
Fig. 9 illustrates an estimation of the Kd for ['"I]T3
and ['I]T4 binding to GH1 cell nuclear extract by the
method of Scatchard after a 2-h incubation at 00C
(20). The Kd for hormone binding with the GH1 cell
nuclear extract was estimated to be 1.8 X 10' M for
[1'I]T3 and 1.2 X 10' M for ['I]T4. Fig. 10 illus￾trates a similar experiment with rat liver nuclear ex￾tract. The estimated Kd was 1.57 X 1010 M for ['I]T3
and 2.0 X 10 M for ['I]T4. In both nuclear extracts,
the affinity of T4 binding was approximately 1/10th
that of T3. This difference in affinity agrees very well
with our observations with intact GH1 cells in which
T4 has 1/10th the intrinsic biologic activity of T3 (6)
as well as 1/10th the affinity for high-affinity nuclear
binding sites (7, 8). The estimated Kd for ['I] T3
binding with the solubilized nuclear binding activity of
GH1 cells and rat liver are also virtually identical to
the Kd estimated with isolated GH1 cell and rat liver
nuclei in vitro (10). Although the number of binding
sites for T3 and T4 appeared to be identical for rat
liver nuclear extract, the T3 and T4 binding curves
did not always intersect at precisely the same point
(Fig. 9). This might suggest that T3 and T4 bind
to dissimilar binding moieties in the nuclear extract.

Each point represents the mean of four determinations, and
each determination did not vary more than 12% from the
mean.
With intact GH1 cells, both T3 and T4 appeared to
bind with the same moiety in the nucleus, and non￾radioactive T3 completely inhibited ['I] T4 nuclear
binding (8). If ['I]T3 and ['I]T4 bind to identical
moieties in the nuclear extract, the binding of each
['I]hormone should be equally inhibited by either
nonradioactive T3 or T4.
We examined this with GH1 cell nuclear extract.
Nonradioactive T3 and T4 inhibited [15I]T3 binding
to the same degree, and both T3 and T4 also equally
inhibited ['2I] T4 binding with nuclear extract. Chro￾matography of the bound ['"I]T3 and the [1I]T4 in￾dicated that the ['I]hormone that was inhibited by
nonradioactive T3 or T4 was ['II]T3 and ["'I]T4,
respectively.
These results suggest that T3 and T4 associate with
identical binding moieties in the solubilized nuclear
extract. Only by isolation and purification of the nu￾clear binding activity, however, can it be definitively
determined whether T3 and T4 bind to an identical
binding moiety in the nucleus.

prepared from GH1 cells was incubated with various con￾centrations of ['OI]T3 and [(I]T4. The cytosol at each
['I]hormone concentration was also incubated with a 200-
fold molar excess of the respective nonradioactive hormone.
After a 2i-h incubation at 0°C, the bound and free hormone
were quantitated, and the magnitude of specific saturable
hormone binding was determined at each ['I]hormone con￾centration as described in Methods. Each point represents
the mean of three determinations, and each determination
did not vary more than 10%o from the mean.
incubation of intact cells with hormone. This indirectly
implied that the mechanism of thyroid hormone binding
to nuclei with intact cells might occur by molecular
mechanisms similar to that reported with steroid hor￾mones (23). By this mechanism, T3 or T4 would ini￾tially interact with a cytosol receptor, and after a
temperature-dependent conformational change, the hor￾mone-receptor complex would associate with nuclear
acceptor sites. Our prior observations, however, were
more consistent with the possibility that thyroid hor￾mone stabilized the nuclear binding activity sufficiently
to permit an exchange reaction with ['25I]T3 in the
second incubation with isolated nuclei.
We examined the characteristics of ['I]T3 and
['I]T4 binding with cytosol of GH1 cells to determine
whether a cytosol binding activity might be related to
the nuclear binding of the thyroid hormones. The time￾course of ['I]T3 and [12I]T4 with GH1 cell cytosol
was examined at 0°C and found to be similar to that
determined with nuclear extract (Fig. 5). Fig. 11 illus￾trates an estimation of the Kd for [1"6I]T3 and [MI]T4
binding with cytosol after a 2-h incubation at 0°C.
The estimated Kd for hormone binding was 2.87 X
10io° M for T4 and 1.13 X 10' M for T3. The Kd for
T4 or T3 was not changed by 0.4 KC1.
The total number of estimated cytosol binding sites
were similar for T3 and T4. In addition, the binding
of ['I]T3 as well as ['I] T4 were each completely
inhibited with either nonradioactive T3 or T4. This
suggested that ['SI]T3 and [IEI]T4 associated with
identical binding moieties in the cytosol fraction.
These results in cytosol contrast with our observa￾tions of the relative affinities of T3 and T4 binding
with nuclei of intact GH1 cells (7, 8) and nuclear ex￾tracts of GH1 cells and rat liver. The 10-fold greater
affinity for T4 compared to T3 in cytosol also contrasts
with the observed greater intrinsic biologic activity of
T3 determined with cultured GH1 cells and intact rats
(6, 24). This suggests that the observed cytosol binding
activity is likely not related to the nuclear binding
activity nor to the observed biologic effects of the thy￾roid hormones. The results do not exclude the possi￾bility, however, that a cytosol receptor not detected by
our in vitro determination is involved in the action of
the thyroid hormones. Our observations with GH1 cell
cytosol also suggest that the nuclear binding activity
determined with isolated nuclei and nuclear extracts
of GH1 cells and rat liver does not result from a non￾specific association of cytosol components with nuclei
during the isolation procedure.
DISCUSSION
Our previous studies indicated that putative nuclear
receptors for the thyroid hormones could be detected
if ['I]T3 or ['I]T4 were incubated with intact GHi
cells in culture (7, 8). The estimated Kd for nuclear
binding with whole cells was 2.9 X 10' M for T3
and 2.5 X 10' M for T4 (7, 8). In addition, the total
number of estimated nuclear binding sites were similar
for both hormones, and the binding of one hormone
was completely inhibited by the other. This suggested
that both T3 and T4 associate with the same binding
moiety in the nucleus. These estimated Kd values for
nuclear binding in whole cells were sufficiently similar
to the estimated free hormone concentrations which
induced a half-maximal increase on GH1 cell replication
to suggest that these high-affinity nuclear binding ac￾tivities functioned as hormonal receptors (6, 8). To
demonstrate that high-affinity nuclear binding is not
unique to rat tissue, but likely reflects a biological inter￾action which can be studied with human tissue, we also
examined the nuclear binding of [MI] T3 with human
lymphocytes (25). The estimated Kd for T3 nuclear
binding after incubation with intact lymphocytes was
3.08 x 10-n M (25). This value is virtually identical to
that determined with cultured GH1 cells.
In order to further relate our observations in cultured
GH, cells to the possible actions of thyroid hormone
862 H. H. Samuels, J. S. Tsai, J. Casanova, and F. Stanley

in vivo, we developed a system to quantitate the asso￾ciation of thyroid hormones by incubation of ['I]hor￾mone directly with isolated nuclei in vitro (7, 8, 10).
The estimated Kt for T3 binding in vitro was 1.65 X
10' M for isolated GH1 cell nuclei and 2.1 X 10' M
for isolated rat liver nuclei (10). The total number of
binding sites per nucleus (8,000) was identical with
isolated GH1 cell nuclei and rat liver nuclei in vitro
and was also the same as that estimated with intact
GH1 cells (10). The fact that the total number of esti￾mated high-affinity sites were the same with intact cells
and isolated nuclei suggested that the binding activity
determined under in vitro conditions represented the
same nuclear binding activity determined with whole
cells. The fivefold lower affinity estimated in vitro was
likely due to the obvious differences in the nuclear
environmental conditions of intact cells and the iso￾lated nuclear binding assay.
The estimated Kt for T3 binding to isolated nuclei,
which we estimated in vitro (10), was also similar to
that determined by Oppenheimer, Schwartz, Koerner,
and Surks after injection of hormone in intact rats
(26). Although estimation of hormonal affinity in vivo
cannot be analyzed under equilibrium conditions, the
similarity of the binding affinities also suggests that the
nuclear binding activity which we observe in vitro is
the same as observed in vivo.
We have previously reported that the nuclear binding
activity extracted from GH1 cell nuclei, as well as rat
liver and rat kidney nuclei, could reassociate with
['I]T3 under in vitro conditions (8, 12).
In our current studies, we have demonstrated that the
nuclear binding activity from GHI cells and rat liver
can be extracted from nuclei with no apparent change
in hormonal affinity.
The fact that the binding activity did not sediment
after centrifugation at 150,000 g for 3 h indicates that
the extracted binding protein is likely in a soluble form.
This does not rule out the possibility that the binding
activity might remain association with small fragments
of nucleic acid.
The estimated Kd for T3 binding with nuclear ex￾tract was 1.8 X 10° M for GH, cells and 1.57 x 10-10
M for rat liver. These Kz values are virtually identical
to those determined with isolated GH, cell and rat liver
nuclei in vitro (10). In addition, the affinity for T4
binding with both nuclear extracts was approximately
1/10th of that observed for T3. The 10-fold greater
affinity for T3 compared to T4, as well as the fact that
either hormone can inhibit the binding of the other in
vitro, is identical to our previous observations on the
nuclear binding with intact GH, cells (8). The 10-fold
greater affinity for T3 compared to T4 with the nuclear
extract also agrees with our observations that T4 has
approximately 1/10th the intrinsic biologic activity of
T3 (6).
To further document that the binding of T3 and T4
with nuclear extract in vitro reflects a biologically rele￾vant association with hormonal receptors, we also ex￾amined the cross-reaction with a variety of hormonal
analogs with ['I]T3 in vitro (27). The extent of
crossreaction with GHI cell and rat liver nuclear ex￾tract was: 3,5,3'-triiodo-D-thyronine (22%), 3,5,3',5'-
tetraiodo-D-thyronine (1.7%), 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine
(0.36%), and L-thyronine (0.23%). These relative af￾finities are virtually identical to the relative differences
in the biologic activity of the hormonal analogs with
cultured GHL cells (6). In addition, these observations
on the cross-reactivity of the hormonal analogs with
T3 in vitro are similar to the observations of Oppen￾heimer, Schwartz, Dillman, and Surks after injection
of the hormonal analogs in vivo (28).
This further supports our conclusion that the in vitro
association of T3 and T4 with nuclear extract reflects
a biologically relevant association with hormonal re￾ceptors and that the in vitro binding activity is the
same moiety as that observed under in vivo conditions.
We examined the biochemical nature of the nuclear
binding activity after association of [1"5I]T3 with ex￾tract in vitro. Chromatographic analysis on Bio-Rex
70 (21), which can separate basic histone proteins
from acidic nonhistone proteins, demonstrated that the
binding activity in vitro was not a histone protein.
Similar observations were also made with solubilized
nuclear binding activity prepared after incubation of
intact GH1 cells with ['I]T3. In addition, the sensi￾tivity of the binding activity in vitro to trypsin and
Pronase, and not to DNase or RNase, indicated that
the binding activity was a protein. This, along with
the observation that the binding activity was not a basic
protein, suggested that the in vitro binding activity
was a nonhistone protein.
Surks et al. previously reported that the binding ac￾tivity extracted after nuclear binding of ['I]T3 in vivo
was a nonhistone protein (11). This was based on a
progressive increase of extractability of the T3-macro￾molecular complex over the pH range of 6.0-8.5 and
relatively less inactivation of the complex by trypsin
compared to chymotrypsin or Pronase. Similar ob￾servations after hormone binding in vivo were also
reported by DeGroot, Refetoff, Strausser, and Bar￾sano (29).
Our studies, however, are in contrast with Surks
et al. (11) and DeGroot et al. (29), in that these
investigators reported that specific association of ['I]-
T3 did not occur with nuclear extract in vitro. This
Thyroid Hormone Binding with Solubilized Nuclear Receptors In Vitro 863

might have resulted from significant proteolytic activity
in the extract due to the different methodology of
nuclear isolation or to the composition of the incubation
mixture used to quantitate the nuclear binding activity.
Cytosol-binding proteins for the thyroid hormones
have been previously reported by several investigators.
Hamada, Torizuka, Miyake, and Fukase reported that
liver cytosol contained distinct binding proteins for T3
and T4 (30). Spaulding and Davis reported that the
liver cytosol of male rats contains two distinct proteins
with estimated mol wts of 95,000 and 45,000 (31).
Sufi, Toccafondi, Malan, and Ekins reported that the
cytosol of porcine anterior pituitary contained binding
proteins for T3 and T4 (32). The estimated Kd for
binding was 7 X 10' M for T4 and 2.5 X 10' M for
T3 (32). The greater affinity for T4 compared to T3
in porcine pituitary cytosol is similar to our observa￾tions with cytosol of GHL cells. In GH, cell cytosol
the estimated Kd for hormone binding was 2.87 X 10'
M for T4 and 1.13 X 10' M for T3. In addition, the
fact that GH, cell cytosol contained a similar number
of binding sites for T3 and T4 and that either hormone
can inhibit the binding of the other suggested that both
hormones associate the same binding species. Although
the cells were extensively washed free of media, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the cytosol binding
activity represents serum binding protein which was
taken up or associated with the surface of the cells.
The marked difference in affinity for T3 and T4 with
the nuclear extract when compared with the cytosol
binding activity, however, indicates that binding with
nuclei or nuclear extract in vitro does not reflect asso￾ciation of the observed cytosol components with nuclei
during tissue fractionation.
The precise biologic role of the cytosol binding ac￾tivity is not clear. The 10-fold greater affinity for T4
compared to T3 are inversely related to observed in￾trinsic biologic activity of these hormones (6, 24).
A significant question relates as to whether the thyroid
hormones associate directly with nuclear receptors in
whole cells or require an initial interaction with a
cytosol binding protein. Our previous observations with
intact GH, cells did not demonstrate a kinetic transfer
of cytosol-bound ['I]T3 to nuclei (8). Cytosol binding
activities with intact GHE cells similar in affinity for T3
as nuclear sites were also not detected. These findings
support the concept that T3 or T4 associate directly
with binding sites in the cell nucleus without a primary
interaction in the cell cytosol.
It remains possible, however, that a putative biologi￾cally relevant cytosol receptor is involved in the action
of the thyroid hormones. This binding activity might be
unstable or require specific activation conditions for
association with thyroid hormone in vitro. Alterna￾tively, the cytosol binding activity determined in vitro
might function as a factor which converts T4 to T3
in vivo.
Our current studies indicate that high-affinity nuclear
binding proteins for T3 and T4 can be isolated in a
soluble and stable form with no apparent change in hor￾monal affinity after dissociation from nuclei. The bind￾ing activity has characteristics of a nonhistone pro￾tein, and the association with T3 and T4 as well as
with hormonal analogs suggests that the binding ac￾tivity determined in vitro likely functions as a receptor
for the thyroid hormones in vivo. Extensions of these
in vitro studies should allow for resolution of the
mechanisms of action of the thyroid hormones at the
molecular level.
