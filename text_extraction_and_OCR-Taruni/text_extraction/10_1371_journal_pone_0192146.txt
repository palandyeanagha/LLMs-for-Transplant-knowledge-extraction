Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important metabolic regulator expressed predomi￾nantly in the liver. In this study, we evaluated the role of LY2405319, an analogue of FGF21,
in hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and in a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD)-diet
induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. During liver injury, HSCs trans-differentiate into acti￾vated myofibroblasts which produce alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and become a
major cell type in hepatic fibrogenesis. Succinate and succinate receptor (GPR91) signaling
has emerged as a regulator to promote α-SMA production in MCD diet- induced mice. Treat￾ment with palmitate or MCD medium on LX-2 cells (HSCs) increased succinate concentra￾tion in the conditioned medium and cell lysate of LX-2 cells and increased production of
GPR91 and α-SMA. However, LY2405319 administration ameliorates palmitate or MCD
media-induced succinate production and decreases over-expression of GPR91 and α-SMA
in LX2-cells. In an in vivo study, the MCD diet treatment caused increased steatohepatitis
and liver fibrosis compared with the control diet in mice. Administration of LY2405319
improved steatohepatitis ameliorated GPR91 and α -SMA production in the liver, decreased
succinate concentration in both liver and serum of MCD diet -induced mice. These results
suggest that FGF21 reduces production of α-SMA by inhibiting the succinate-GPR91 path￾way. We conclude that FGF21 acts as an inhibitor of the succinate-GPR91 pathway to con￾trol liver fibrosis. This suggests that FGF21 has therapeutic potential for treating liver
fibrogenesis.
Introduction
Hepatic fibrosis is a wound- healing response to chronic liver injury. During liver injury, acti￾vation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a major process to produce extracellular matrix struc￾tures, which eventually leads to the development of liver fibrosis [1,2].

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a member of a family of growth factors known to be
crucial endocrine factors and belongs to the FGF19 subfamily [3]. FGF21 has been reported to
reverse hepatic steatosis and improve insulin sensitivity in high -fat diet-induced obese mice
[4]. FGF21 transgenic mice fed high -fat/high -carbohydrate diet for 15 weeks showed protec￾tion against diet-induced obesity [5], and FGF21 knockout (KO) mice developed more severe
steatosis and fibrosis than wild- type mice [6]. Recently, administration of FGF21 was found to
ameliorate hepatic fibrogenesis in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) -induced fibrotic livers in
mice [7].
Succinate, an important intermediate of the citric acid cycle, is formed from oxidation of
succinyl-CoA and converted into fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is cata￾lyzed by the enzyme succinyl-CoA hydrolase [8,9]. In hypoxic conditions or when there is a
dysregulation of energy balance, succinate is secreted from the mitochondrial and acts as an
extracellular signaling molecular by binding to a specific G -protein couple receptor 91 (GPR
91) [10,11]. Once GPR91 is activated, it influences several highly vascularized tissues, such as
kidney, heart, retina, white adipose tissue, and liver [8,12,13].
Regarding the role of succinate in the liver, recent study reported that activated GPR91 led
to stimulation of HSCs and using adeno -associated virus (AAV) -mediated RNA disruption
of GPR91 gene expression in MCD diet -fed mice as a model of non -alcoholic fatty liver dis￾ease (NAFLD), considerably ameliorated steatohepatitis and fibrosis [14].
However, the relationship between FGF21 and succinate—GPR91 signaling in HSCs
remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of LY2405319, an FGF21 analogue,
on the succinate-GPR91 pathway in HSC activation, using LX-2 cells and an MCD diet–
induced mouse model of NAFLD.
Materials and methods
Materials
Overexpression of α-SMA was used as a standard marker for HSC activation [1]. Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s media (DMEM), completely deficient of methionine and choline medium
(MCD medium) and methionine- and choline supplements (MCS medium and control
medium, respectively) were purchased from WELGENE (Kyeongsan, Korea). Palmitate and
succinate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). LY2405319, a recombinant pro￾tein analogue of FGF21, was supplied by Lilly Company (Indianapolis, IN, USA).
2.1. Cell culture. LX-2 cells are immortalized human hepatic stellate cells[15], and were
kindly provided by Prof. Ja June Jang, Seoul National University, Korea. The LX-2 cells were
cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomy￾cin. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37˚C incubator with 5% CO2.
Animals and administration of FGF21 analogue
Male C57BJ6 mice, 6-to 8 -weeks-old and weighing 22–25 g, were purchased from Doo Yeol
Biotech (Seoul, Korea). All mice were housed at ambient temperature (22 ± 1˚C) with a 12/
12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and food. The mice were fed with the MCD diet
(MCD diet group) as an animal model of NAFLD, or control chow diet (control group) for 8
weeks. The MCD diet–group mice were randomly divided into two groups after 4 weeks of
being fed the MCD diet and were administered the LY2405319, an FGF21 analogue, (1.5 mg/
kg/day; n = 8) or a phosphate–buffered saline (PBS) solution (control MCD group; n = 8) daily
for 4 weeks. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was used for euthanasia agent for mice. This animal
research protocal has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Kangwon university (KW-160601-1).

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH￾7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mix￾ture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on ice. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved
on an SDS/PAGE gel and then electro -transferred onto PVDF membranes and blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Levels of proteins were determined by
incubation with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions. Primary antibodies included those
specific for GPR91 (sc-50466, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), α-SMA
(GTX112861, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), GAPDH (GTX627408, GeneTex), AMP-activated
protein kinase alpha (AMPKα, 2532, Cell Signaling Technology), pPhospho-AMPKα (Thr172)
(2535, Cell Signaling Technology), collagen type 1 (COL1A1, Rockland Antibodies & Assays,
Limerick, PA, USA). The membranes were further incubated with secondary antibodies conju￾gated to HRP, and protein bands detected using the Westsave Star Detection Reagent system
(AbFrontier, Seoul, Korea). GAPDH was used as a loading control for western blot analysis.
Succinate assay
The level of cellular succinate was determined using a succinate colorimetric assay kit (BioVi￾sion, CA, USA). Succinate levels were detected by absorbance at 450 nm with each measure￾ment being performed in triplicate.
Histological analysis
Samples of mouse liver were fixed in 10% (w/v) phosphate-buffered formalin for 18–20 h.
After dehydration through a graded series of ethanol solutions, the tissues were embedded in
paraffin wax. Serial frontal sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),
and Masson’s trichrome.
Cell viability assays and proliferation assay
Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. For MTT assay, 25,000 cells/well were seeded in
24-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, LX-2 cells were treated with Palmitate (300 μM), MCD
medium and LY2405319 (100 nM) in 24h and then make assessment with MTT. MTT (50 μl,
1 mg/ml in DMEM without phenol red) was added to each well and keep for 4 h in incubator
at 37˚C. Absorbance was taken at 570 nm. Untreated cells at initial time of treatment were
used as control (100% cell survival). For cell proliferation analysis the cell proliferation ELISA
BrdU (Roche applied science) was applied.
Statistical analyses
All data are expressed as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Data anal￾yses for the two groups were performed by ANOVA test with p-values < 0.05 being considered
statistically significant.
Results
LY2405319 ameliorates succinate-, palmitate- and MCD medium-induced
HSCs activation
To directly investigate the influence of succinate, palmitate and MCD medium on activation
of HSCs, we cultured LX-2 cells in DMEM medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% peni￾cillin streptomycin for 24h and then treated cell with 400 μM succinate or 300 μM palmitate or

incubated with MCD medium for 24h. Western blotting was performed to evaluate α-SMA,
Collagen type1 and GPR91 expressions. When LX-2 cells were incubated with succinate, pal￾mitate and MCD medium for 24h, increase in expression of α-SMA and GPR91 was observed,
which was reversed by LY2405319 (100 nM) treatment (Fig 1). Increased RNA expressions of
α-SMA, Collagen type1 and GPR91 expressions induced by succinate, palmitate and MCD
medium for 24h were ameliorated by LY2405319 treatment (S1 Fig). Succinate, palmitate and
MCD medium decreased the phosphorylation of AMPK and LY2405319 treatment attenuated
the decrease of AMPK phosphorylation. These results suggest that succinate, palmitate, and
MCD medium treatment led to HSC activation, through direct activation of GPR91 and that
treatment with an FGF21 analogue may block HSC activation via GPR91 downregulation or
AMPK activation.
LY2405319 attenuates succinate concentrations in extracellular media and
cell lysates of LX-2 cells stimulated by palmitate or MCD treatment and
inhibits cell proliferation of LX-2 cells
We examined whether LY2405319 downregulates HSC activation by decreasing succinate lev￾els and GPR91 expression in the presence of MCD medium or palmitate. The optical density
of succinate concentrations in cell lysate and the media was measured. LX-2 cells exposed to
palmitate (300 μM) and MCD medium for 24h showed increased secretion of succinate in
their conditioned media and cell lysates. Conversely, treatment of LY2405319 (100 nM) signif￾icantly alleviated palmitate- and MCD medium- induced elevation of succinate concentration
in the extracellular media and cell lysates of LX -2 cells (Fig 2C). These results suggest that pal￾mitate and MCD medium promote succinate secretion from LX-2 cells, resulting in increased
expression of GPR91 and α-SMA, which is mitigated by LY2405319 treatment.
To evaluate inhibition efficacy of LY2405319 on LX-2 cells stimulated by palmitate-or
MCD medium, we cultured LX-2 cells in 24h and then administration with palmitate
(300 μM) or MCD medium in next 24 h. The exposure of palmitate and MCD medium boost
the growth of LX-2 cells, whereas treatment of LY2405319 (100 nM) inhibits the proliferation
of LX-2 cells (Fig 2A and 2B). These results show that palmitate and MCD medium increase
the proliferation of HSCs and the development of HSCs will be inhibited under the adminis￾tration of FGF21 analogue.
LY2405319 decreases expression of collagen type 1, α-SMA and GPR91 in
the liver and improves steatohepatitis and fibrosis in an MCD–diet mouse
model
A series of experimental methods were used to evaluate whether LY2405319 administration
could improve hepatic fibrogenesis. The expression of α-SMA and collagen type 1 in the liver
were evaluated by western blotting. The expression of α-SMA and GPR91 in the liver of mice
fed with MCD diet for 8 weeks was increased compared to that in control, whereas administra￾tion of LY2405319 attenuated the increase of collagen type 1, α-SMA and GPR91 protein levels
(Fig 3). Moreover, LY2405319 intraperitoneal administration for 4 weeks daily ameliorated
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis that was induced by MCD diet.
LY2405319 decreases succinate concentration in liver lysate and in the
serum of MCD diet–induced mouse models of liver fibrosis
We measured optical density of succinate concentration from liver lysate and serum to evalu￾ate whether LY2405319 attenuates liver fibrogenesis through inhibition of succinate level. The

results showed that succinate concentration in liver lysate and serum of MCD diet mice are
higher than those in control groups and LY2405319 injected group (Fig 4). These results sug￾gest that the administration of LY2405319 attenuates the increase of succinate level caused by
MCD diet mice, resulting in the improvement of liver fibrogenesis stage in MCD diet mice.
Discussion
In this study, we tested whether LY2405319, an FGF21 analogue, can be a potential therapeutic
treatment for hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting HSC activation via suppressing succinate-GPR91
signaling in an MCD diet -induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. LY2405319 used as the mod￾ification of FGF21, show the same in efficacy and biological activity with native human FGF21
in cell-based, rodent, and non- human primate assay[16,17].
Succinate, known to be a TCA cycle intermediate has emerged as an important signaling
molecule in ischemic liver damage or chronic liver diseases [8,14,18,19]. In a previous study,
elevation in succinate concentrations in the plasma and in both isolated hepatocytes and HSCs
of MCD diet -fed mice was observed compared with that in controls, suggesting both systemic
and local action of succinate in HSC activation [19]. In the same study [14], increased succi￾nate concentrations and over expression of GPR91 were found in an MCD diet- fed mouse
model of NAFLD and knockout of the GPR91 gene led to attenuation of steatosis and fibrosis
in an MCD diet–induced mouse model of non -alcoholic steatohepatitis.
FGF21 boosts glucose uptake, decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases insulin sensitiv￾ity and lessens hyperglycemia in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity [4]. Moreover, FGF21
increases hepatic lipid oxidation and inhibits lipogenesis, thereby, causing a decline in the con￾centration of circulating free fatty acids and LDL-cholesterol, while increasing HDL-choles￾terol levels [4]. In accordance with these observations, FGF21 has been found to prevent
hepatic steatosis [4] and atherosclerosis [20] and, furthermore, it has been shown to have ther￾apeutic potential against metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes [21]. The level of FGF21 in
serum has been found to be elevated in several metabolic disorders related to obesity [22]. The
high level of serum FGF21 in obese subjects can be explained as a compensatory mechanism
or FGF21 receptor feedback [23]. In a recent study, the hepatic expression level of β-Klotho, a
critical co-receptor of FGF 21 was negatively associated with plasma FGF21 levels in mice, sug￾gesting a resistance to FGF21 [24].
In this study, we demonstrated that both succinate concentration and GPR91 expression is
increased in the fibrotic liver of MCD -induced mouse model of liver fibrosis and that the
administration of LY2405319 decreased the expressions of GPR91, α-SMA and collagen type 1
in the liver of MCD fed mice. Moreover, treatment of LY2405319 inhibited the increase of suc￾cinate concentration in both liver and blood circulation of MCD diet mice. At a cellular level,
treatment of LY2405319 blocked the increase in expression of GPR91 in HSCs caused by succi￾nate. Additionally, palmitate- and MCD-supplemented medium of HSCs increased the con￾centrations of succinate and expressions of GPR91 and α-SMA in HSCs, which was reversed
by LY2405319 co-treatment. Finally, the administration of LY2405319 inhibit proliferation of
HSCs stimulated by palmitate and MCD medium. These findings suggest that LY2405319
inhibits accumulation of succinate levels and expression of its receptor GPR91, which results
in blocking the growth and activation of HSCs. Therefore, the development of inhibitors or

antagonists targeting GPR91 are likely to have significant therapeutic potential in the treat￾ment of the liver fibrosis.
There are few studies on the relationship between FGF21 and hepatic stellate cell activation
[7]. A recent study reported that FGF21 blocked α-SMA production of cytokine transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β)-, platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB)-, nuclear transcrip￾tion factor-κB (NF-κB)-induced HSC activation and caused apoptosis of activated HSC [7].
In the present study, we demonstrated that the expressions of GPR91, α-SMA, collagen
type 1 increased in succinate-, palmitate-, and MCD -treated HSCs and this overexpression
was inhibited by co-treatment with LY2405319, suggesting a novel pathway of FGF21 in sup￾pressing the HSCs activation via GPR91 signaling.
The exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which FGF21 blocks activation of HSCs
still remains an interesting area of investigation for future studies. Given that FGF21 is mainly
secreted by the liver, how FGF21 controls HSC activation remains to be determined [25].
Three plausible hypotheses can be given for research direction. First, FGF21 can regulate α￾SMA by activating its receptor in HSCs. Second, FGF21 can influence hepatocytes, resulting in
the decrease of secretion of both succinate and inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-β and
PDGF, which play important roles in the activation of HSCs [1,14,26]. Further experiments to
examine FGF21 receptor expression in HSCs and hepatocytes need to be conducted to investi￾gate this possibility. Further, even though the main recruitment of FGF21 is from hepatocytes,
its effect on the liver and other tissues possibly stem from activation of downstream signals

release from other organs. It is known that FGF21 regulates metabolic processes and homeo￾stasis of the liver by controlling adiponectin secretion from adipose tissue [27,28] and cortico￾sterone synthesis through the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis [29,30], which can
increase 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the liver
[28,31,32]. Interestingly, AMPK, a key metabolic player in the regulation of cellular energy
homeostasis, displays clear overlap with FGF21 in metabolic profile. Both FGF21 and AMPK
augment glucose uptake and reduce hyperglycemia as well as enhance free fatty acid oxidation
and energy expenditure [33–35]. Additionally, it has been reported that AMPK activation
decreases α-SMA -production in activated HSCs [36], suggesting that FGF21 could regulate
AMPK phosphorylation to inhibit expression of α-SMA in a mouse model of NAFLD via trig￾gering adiponectin release from adipocytes. Furthermore, whether activator or inhibitor of
AMPK may influence succinate levels and GPR91 expression remains a significant unan￾swered question. In this study we showed that the FGF21 treatment increased AMPK phos￾phorylation suggesting the interaction of AMPK and FGF21. The crosstalk between the
AMPK pathway and the succinate-GPR91 pathway will be crucial topic to study in the future.
The succinate—GPR91 pathway is a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate hepatic fibro￾genesis in mouse models. Additionally, the efficacy of an FGF21 analogue on bile duct liga￾tion-, and in alcohol- and virus- induced liver diseases in mice with different etiologies of liver
injury has not been well elucidated. The molecular downstream mechanisms by which an
FGF21 analogue mitigates hepatic fibrosis, therefore, remains to be clarified. However, the
FGF21 -succinate -GPR91 signaling pathway will likely play a key role in mouse models of
liver fibrosis, although it may not be exactly the same in humans, and will require further
study to delineate how FGF21 and GPR91 signaling pathway may work in liver fibrosis in
humans.
In clinical trials, FGF21 analogues including LY2405319 produced by Eli Lilly Company
and PF05231023 (PF) produced by Pfizer, induced a dose -dependent reduction in levels of
plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol, and an eleva￾tion in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo treatment [21,37].
However, the glycemic endpoint in humans was not significantly altered in these studies
[21,37]. The overall results from this clinical experiment were positive and indicative of the
translational relevance of FGF21 pharmacology from animals to humans.
In conclusion, this research demonstrated that administration of FGF21 reduces the pro￾duction of α-SMA through inhibition of succinate -GPR91 signaling in HSCs and improves
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in an MCD diet -induce mouse model. Owing to the therapeutic
potential of FGF21 analogue and inhibition of succinate signaling, the development of FGF21
agonists and drug delivery systems targeting both FGF21 and the succinate -GPR91 pathway
in humans requires further investigation.
