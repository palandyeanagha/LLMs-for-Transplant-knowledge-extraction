Interpretação da positividade de autoanticorpos na doença pulmonar

Abstract
The initial evaluation of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) primarily involves a comprehensive, active 
search for the cause. Autoantibody assays, which can suggest the presence of a rheumatic disease, are routinely 
performed at various referral centers. When interstitial lung involvement is the condition that allows the definitive 
diagnosis of connective tissue disease and the classical criteria are met, there is little debate. However, there is 
still debate regarding the significance, relevance, specificity, and pathophysiological role of autoimmunity in 
patients with predominant pulmonary involvement and only mild symptoms or formes frustes of connective 
tissue disease. The purpose of this article was to review the current knowledge of autoantibody positivity and 
to discuss its possible interpretations in patients with ILD and without clear etiologic associations, as well as 
to enhance the understanding of the natural history of an allegedly new disease and to describe the possible 
prognostic implications. We also discuss the proposition of a new term to be used in the classification of ILDs: 
lung-dominant connective tissue disease.

Resumo
A avaliação inicial de pacientes com doença pulmonar intersticial (DPI) envolve primordialmente a busca ativa e 
detalhada por uma etiologia. A pesquisa rotineira de autoanticorpos é comum em diferentes centros e permite 
sugerir a presença de alguma doença do espectro reumatológico. Quando o acometimento pulmonar intersticial 
é a condição que permite o diagnóstico firmado de uma colagenose bem estabelecida, preenchendo os critérios 
clássicos, há pouco debate. Entretanto, ainda existe muita discussão sobre o significado, a relevância, a especificidade 
e o papel fisiopatológico da autoimunidade nos pacientes que tenham prioritariamente acometimento respiratório 
e apenas algum indício leve ou frustro de colagenose. O propósito dessa revisão foi apresentar o conhecimento 
atual e discutir possibilidades de interpretação da positividade de autoanticorpos em pacientes com DPI que 
não tenham associações etiológicas inequívocas, assim como aumentar o entendimento da história natural de 
uma possível nova doença e descrever possíveis implicações prognósticas. Discutimos ainda a proposição de 
uma nova terminologia na classificação das DPIs, a colagenose pulmão dominante.

Interpretation of autoantibody positivity in interstitial lung disease 
and lung-dominant connective tissue disease
J Bras Pneumol. 2013;39(6):728-741

The purpose of this article was to review the 
current knowledge of autoantibody positivity 
and to discuss its possible interpretations in 
patients with ILD without etiologic associations, 
as well as to standardize recognition of these 
diseases, enhance the understanding of their 
natural history, and describe the prognostic 
implications. We also discuss the proposition 
of a new term to be used in the classification 
of ILDs: lung-dominant CTD (LDCTD). 
CTD-associated ILD and 
undifferentiated CTD
The challenge of answering the question of 
whether IIP is actually a pulmonary manifestation 
of occult CTD increases when the criteria for 
defining CTDs are taken into consideration.(20,21) In 
the context of CTD-associated ILD, two scenarios 
are possible: one in which a patient with CTD 
subsequently develops respiratory symptoms 
due to new interstitial involvement; and one in 
which ILD-related respiratory symptoms precede 
or coincide with clinical and laboratory findings 
of autoimmune diseases.(19,21)
In the first scenario, when there is no doubt 
about the association between ILD and CTD, the 
causal relationship must be confirmed,(1,9,11) and 
it is essential to exclude potential causes of ILD, 
such as drug use, smoking, and infection. (22-25)
In addition, the functional consequences of 
lung involvement and the need for treatment 
modification in the presence of ILD must be 
evaluated.(1) Lung biopsy is rarely indicated in 
this scenario, being reserved for cases having 
atypical presentations or for those in which there 
is the possibility of another cause for ILD.(4,18,23,26)
In the second scenario, in which pulmonary 
involvement predominates and there is no definite 
CTD, the difficulties increase significantly, which is 
mainly due to the fact that definitive rheumatologic 
criteria have yet to be established.(12,19,21) Historically, 
although the lung interstitium is a major target 
of CTD-associated autoimmunity, the lung is 
traditionally overlooked in the diagnostic criteria 
for these diseases.(10,12) As an example, there is the 
case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented 
with dyspnea, dry cough, moderate restrictive lung 
disease, Raynaud’s phenomenon, telangiectases 
of the hands, a pattern of NSIP (as determined 
by HRCT), esophageal dilation with an air-fluid 
level (as determined by HRCT), homogeneous ANF 
(titer, 1:1,280), and positive anti-Ro antibodies 
(Figure 1). Although the patient showed clear 
Introduction
Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are 
heterogeneous diseases that affect the lung 
parenchyma in a diffuse and multicompartmental 
manner, being characterized by different 
combinations of inflammation and fibrosis; the 
understanding of ILDs has increased dramatically 
in recent years.(1) On the basis of histological 
and CT patterns, ILDs can be subdivided into 
categories, as follows: granulomatous diseases; 
lymphoid diseases; miscellaneous; idiopathic 
diseases; and diseases of known cause, which 
include connective tissue diseases (CTDs).(1,2)
There is considerable radiological, functional, and 
histological overlap among the abovementioned 
categories, especially between the last two. 
Among ILDs, CTDs are of great importance, 
and pulmonary involvement causes significant 
functional limitation, which is the leading cause 
of death in such patients.(3) However, other factors 
determining ILD can be observed in patients with 
rheumatic diseases, and these factors should 
be taken into consideration in the differential 
diagnosis: i) a reasonable proportion of such 
patients were smokers at some point; ii) various 
drugs that are potentially toxic to the lungs are 
used in the treatment of CTDs; and iii) there is 
an increased susceptibility to infections.(1,4) In 
addition, the ILD patterns that are most commonly 
identified in this population can be quite similar 
to idiopathic forms.(2-10)
In the initial evaluation of patients with 
clinical and CT signs of ILD, serum autoantibody 
positivity is not uncommon.(1,11-14) In addition, 
routine ANF and serum autoantibody testing for 
the detection of occult CTD is recommended in 
several consensus guidelines for ILDs.(1,10-13,15)
Since 1994, when Katzenstein and Fiorelli first 
described the histological pattern of nonspecific 
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), the understanding 
of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) and the 
role of CTDs in their etiology has changed.(5,16,17) It 
is well established that CTD-associated ILD has a 
better prognosis than does IIP.(7,8) However, many 
questions remain unanswered, including those 
regarding patients with ILD and positive ANF 
or serum autoantibodies.(12,13) Do such patients 
have formes frustes of CTD, which initially or 
exclusively manifest as ILD?(10,17,18) Will such 
patients present with well-defined CTD in the 
follow-up period?(12,19) Are there prognostic or 
therapeutic peculiarities?(17)

The main characteristics of patients with 
UCTD are as follows: being female; being younger 
than 50 years of age; testing positive for ANF 
(approximately 80% of cases); and testing 
positive for various autoantibodies, especially 
anti-Ro (SSA) autoantibodies.(28-31) Patients with 
UCTD have predominant joint involvement 
that is mild to moderate in intensity and that 
resolves spontaneously or responds quite well 
to prednisone.(32) Commonly reported symptoms 
include Raynaud’s phenomenon, xerophthalmia, 
xerostomia, joint pain, and morning stiffness. It 
is possible that up to one third of patients will 
meet the diagnostic criteria for a specific CTD (in 
signs of autoimmune disease, they were not 
sufficient to establish a specific rheumatologic 
diagnosis, such as progressive systemic sclerosis 
(PSS).(14) If the patient had presented with a history 
of large joint arthritis for at least three years, 
the rheumatology team might have considered 
a diagnosis of undifferentiated CTD (UCTD).(27)
Therefore, various rheumatologists seem to believe 
that predominant pulmonary involvement is not 
enough to recognize an autoimmune etiology. 
The term UCTD is used in order to define 
patients with unclassifiable CTD, and the criteria 
presented in Chart 1 are currently used for the 
diagnosis of UCTD.(27)

order to determine the presence or absence of 
a systemic disease. Although most tests are not 
highly specific or sensitive for the diagnosis of 
CTD, a positive result in conjunction with clinical 
changes can indicate the presence of a CTD with 
a high degree of confidence.(3,14,36)
Homma et al. were the first to show the 
possibility of ILD as the sole presentation of occult 
CTD, having followed (for up to 11 years) 68 
patients in whom the initial evaluation showed no 
clinical or serological evidence of CTD.(37) Of the 68 
patients, 13 (19%) developed a definite CTD after 
an average of 25 months of follow-up: rheumatoid 
arthritis, in 5; polymyositis/dermatomyositis, in 
5; systemic lupus erythematosus, in 1; Sjögren’s 
syndrome (SS), in 1; and mixed CTD, in 1. In 
comparison with the remaining patients, those 
who met diagnostic criteria for a given CTD 
were younger, most being female. Creatine 
phosphokinase and ESR were the biochemical 
markers that distinguished between the two groups 
of patients, together with discoid atelectasis 
in the lower lung fields on chest X-rays.(37,38)
At a time when autoantibody assays were not 
available in clinical practice, those results shed 
light on the possibility of predominant pulmonary 
manifestation of occult CTD or even the currently 
recognized LDCTD. 
In a recent study aimed at evaluating the 
prevalence of occult CTD in all ILD patients 
presenting exclusively with respiratory symptoms, 
careful multidisciplinary evaluation and a 
comprehensive autoimmune panel showed that 
34 (29%) of the 114 patients with confirmed 
ILD met diagnostic criteria for CTD.(39) Of those 
34 patients, half had met diagnostic criteria for 
CTD in the initial evaluation and the other half 
were diagnosed during the follow-up period, the 
incidence of CTD in the cohort being 15%. The 
most common autoantibodies were ANF, in 56%, 
rheumatoid factor (RF), in 31%, and anti-Ro, in 
15%. Inflammatory myopathies were present in 
50% of cases, and the histological pattern most 
commonly associated with CTD was NSIP. An 
independent analysis of the data from that study 
shows that, of the 80 patients who showed no 
association with CTD at the end of the study 
period, 34 (42.5%) tested positive for ANF (7 
of whom had ANF titer greater than or equal to 
1:640) and 11 (16.3%) had a nucleolar pattern, 
which is highly specific for PSS.(14,40) These findings 
strongly suggest the presence of occult CTD. 
particular, systemic lupus erythematosus) up to 
2 years after the onset of symptoms; thereafter, 
this possibility is reduced, and most patients 
will persist with mild impairment (as observed 
at the onset of the disease), without meeting 
the diagnostic criteria for a specific CTD.(30-32)
In patients with UCTD, extra-articular 
involvement (including respiratory involvement) 
is rare.(29-31) These findings stand in contrast to the 
finding of severe pulmonary involvement habitually 
seen in patients with ILD and unclassifiable 
CTD.(13,15,33-35) In the practice of pulmonology, 
autoantibody-positive ILD patients who do not 
meet the diagnostic criteria for any established CTD 
present with pulmonary involvement whose intensity 
is markedly different from that of pulmonary 
involvement in relevant cohorts of patients with 
UCTD. This is the main reason why some authors 
avoid using the term UCTD to refer to cases of 
ILD and autoantibody positivity. In 2010, Fischer 
et al. proposed that the term LDCTD be used in 
order to characterize patients with any known 
pattern of ILD (usual interstitial pneumonia—
UIP—NSIP, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, 
organizing pneumonia, desquamative interstitial 
pneumonia, etc.) associated with the presence 
of at least one CTD-specific autoantibody, two 
histological findings classically associated with 
pulmonary involvement secondary to CTD, or 
both, these findings, however, not characterizing 
a well-established rheumatic disease or an 
alternative etiology for ILD (Chart 2).(12) These 
stricter criteria, which include clinical, laboratory, 
CT, and histological findings, are intended for use 
in studies aimed at understanding the natural 
history, prognosis, and therapeutic response of 
this allegedly new form of ILD. 
Importance of autoantibody 
positivity in the evaluation of 
patients with ILD
In patients with ILD and suspected occult 
CTD, specific laboratory tests are needed in

mesenchymal behavior during the tissue repair 
process, producing fibrogenic cytokines.(1,44)
Because IPF is a disease that is limited to the 
lungs, there is much debate about the presence 
of autoantibodies and clinical manifestations of 
occult CTD in patients with IPF. According to the 
recently published Brazilian Thoracic Association 
Guidelines for ILDs, up to 25% of patients have 
low-titer ANF and RF. However, this is considered 
to have no clinical relevance if CTD is excluded, 
determination of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(anti-CCP) antibodies being recommended in order 
to confirm rheumatoid arthritis in RF-positive 
patients.(1) It remains unknown whether the 
association between IPF and serum markers 
of immunity is only fortuitous or whether the 
identification of autoantibodies in such patients 
has any pathophysiological relevance. 
Of all known rheumatic diseases, PSS is 
the disease in which fibrotic involvement is 
most pronounced.(45) The classic cutaneous 
manifestations of PSS (sclerodactyly, scleroderma 
facies, and morphea) cause significant thickening 
and tightening of the skin, which are markers of 
multisystem fibrotic involvement.(3) Interstitial lung 
injury is more closely related to the limited form 
of systemic sclerosis, which is known as CREST 
syndrome (CREST being an acronym for Calcinosis, 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, 
Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia). Although NSIP 
Although the diagnoses of those 80 patients 
were not reported, the serological evidence of 
autoimmunity in those patients is curious, given 
that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most 
prevalent ILD. Although autoantibody positivity 
in the absence of clinical evidence of CTD should 
be interpreted with great caution, screening for 
autoantibodies in patients with diffuse parenchymal 
lung disease (as recommended by national and 
international guidelines) is justified.(1,11) It is of 
note that a rigorous evaluation is required in order 
to diagnose inflammatory myopathies.(38,41) Given 
that these conditions are commonly accompanied 
by interstitial lung involvement, recognition of 
occult manifestations requires a high degree 
of suspicion, an active search for desquamative 
lesions on the hands and increased serum muscle 
enzymes being therefore justified. 
Autoantibodies and IPF
A specific form of chronic interstitial 
pneumonia, IPF is a disease of unknown etiology 
that is limited to the lungs and that occurs 
primarily in adults in their sixth decade of life, 
being associated with the histological and CT 
patterns of UIP.(1,42) The most widely accepted 
theory for the pathogenesis of IPF involves an 
interaction between alveolar epithelial injury and 
apoptosis, followed by abnormal mesenchymal 
repair.(43) The damaged epithelial cells adopt a

with lung epithelial injury suggesting the 
presence of autoimmunity. Takahashi et al. 
assessed autoantibody positivity in 22 patients 
with IPF and compared those patients with 37 
healthy individuals.(48) Through techniques of 
immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation 
of epithelial lung cells, the authors identified 
in the sera from IPF patients an antibody that 
precipitated in the cytoplasm of those cells 
but not in that of cells of mesenchymal origin 
(ovary). Spectrophotometry of the precipitated 
immunocomplex allowed the isolation of the 
antigen, which was a protein consistent with 
alanyl-tRNA synthetase (also known as PL-12) 
in 50% of the patients with IPF. This antibody 
is associated with inflammatory myopathies 
that affect the pulmonary interstitium (such as 
antisynthetase syndrome), although it is present 
in only a small proportion of such patients.
(38) Despite a potential systematic error in the 
diagnosis of IPF in that study, the presence of that 
autoantibody in half of the sample adds validity 
to the findings and shows that autoimmunity 
plays a relevant role in the pathogenesis of IPF 
(in some patients, at least). In addition, ensuring 
the distinction between IPF and CTD, the antigen 
described was present in less than 5% of the 
patients with CTD-associated ILD in whom the 
techniques described above were performed. 
There is a tendency in the literature to interpret 
the presence of nonspecific autoantibodies or 
low-titer ANF in patients with IPF as positivity 
that is similar to that in the general population 
(20-30%) and that generally has no clinical 
consequences.(1,35,39,40,42,47,48) However, in a 
subgroup of patients, the presence of associated 
autoimmunity can have an impact on prognosis 
and response to treatment. In the case of diseases 
for which there is currently insufficient scientific 
evidence to endorse most of the treatments that 
are currently available, identifying patients 
with stigmata of autoimmunity can stimulate 
pharmacological innovations. In addition, formes 
frustes of rheumatic diseases and occult forms 
of CTD should not be forgotten. 
Autoantibodies and idiopathic NSIP
Early in the last decade, an international panel 
of experts in ILDs met, with the support of the 
American Thoracic Society, in order to gain a 
better understanding of idiopathic NSIP in light of 
the scientific knowledge available at the time.(17)
is the pattern that is most commonly associated 
with PSS, UIP is quite common.(46) Because of 
the difficulty in excluding occult CTD in patients 
with ILD, Fischer et al. reported the serological 
findings in patients with a clinical diagnosis 
of IPF.(40) Of the 285 patients who were tested 
for ANF, 25 had titers greater than 1:40 and a 
nucleolar-staining pattern. Among the various 
antinuclear antibodies found in patients with 
PSS, antinucleolar antibodies are found in 
10-15%. Antinucleolar antibodies constitute 
a group of heterogeneous autoantibodies that 
cause ANF to have an antinucleolar pattern of 
immunofluorescence, being highly specific markers 
of PSS. Of the 25 IPF patients who had a positive 
ANF, 13 tested positive for anti-Th/To antibody—
an antinucleolar antibody that is strongly related 
to systemic sclerosis-associated ILD—PSS being 
therefore confirmed. This underscores the need 
for comprehensive serological testing for the 
identification of occult CTD in patients with IPF, 
with therapeutic and prognostic implications. 
The results of a recently published study 
investigating the prevalence and clinical 
significance of circulating autoantibodies 
in 67 patients with IPF(47) add weight to the 
abovementioned conclusion. Autoantibody 
positivity was found in 22% of the patients 
with IPF and in 21% of the healthy controls. 
There were no differences between the IPF 
patients with circulating antibodies and those 
without in terms of clinical characteristics, CT 
findings, histological features, or treatment 
response. However, the subgroup of patients 
with circulating autoantibodies had a longer 
transplant-free survival time. The authors also 
compared the group of IPF patients who tested 
positive for circulating autoantibodies (n = 15) 
with a group of patients with UCTD (n = 22) 
and found that the latter were younger and had 
higher titers of ANF. 
Therefore, the significance of positive 
autoantibodies in patients with IPF depends 
on the presence of systemic signs of rheumatic 
disease and on the specificity of the technique used 
for screening, as well as on autoantibody titers 
and patterns. In the presence of these factors, an 
alternative diagnosis of CTD (rather than IPF) is 
possible. However, studies have recognized the role 
of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of IPF, the 
identification of circulating autoantibodies and 
the direct association of circulating autoantibodies 

734 Pereira DAS, Kawassaki AM, Baldi BG

the groups in terms of physical examination 
findings. Regarding CT findings, ground-glass 
opacities and consolidations were more common 
in the UCTD group, whereas honeycombing was 
more common in the IIP group (being more 
consistent with the UIP pattern). In the histological 
analysis, most of the patients with UCTD were 
found to have the NSIP pattern, which was rarely 
found in the IIP group. The UIP pattern (as 
determined by pathological examination) was 
positively associated with IIP (OR = 111) and 
negatively associated UCTD (OR = 0.009). The 
authors concluded that the NSIP pattern is strongly 
associated with patients with CTD symptoms, 
especially Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia, and 
gastrointestinal manifestations, when associated 
with positive serum autoantibodies. In addition, 
the authors suggested that meeting diagnostic 
criteria for UCTD in this context constitutes a 
predictor of NSIP, which is actually a pulmonary 
manifestation of systemic autoimmunity.(13) Suda 
et al.(49) evaluated 47 patients with idiopathic 
NSIP and, by applying the same criteria as those 
applied by Kinder et al.,(13) identified 22 cases of 
UCTD (47%), which were compared with those 
of patients who did not meet those criteria. In 
addition to having found clinical and laboratory 
features that were quite similar to those found 
in the previous study, the authors demonstrated 
that cases considered idiopathic showed a higher 
mortality rate than did those with UCTD, as well 
as showing a lower 5-year survival rate (58% vs. 
100%). For the first time, it was suggested that 
the prognosis of such patients follows the pattern 
of that of other patients with CTD-associated 
ILD, progression being more favorable. 
In contrast, in another recent study, in which 
stricter diagnostic criteria were applied, 63 (32%) 
of 200 patients with ILD met diagnostic criteria 
for autoimmunity, and 58 (29%) met diagnostic 
criteria for IPF.(35) In the autoimmunity group, the 
UIP pattern was the most common CT finding 
(62%), correlating well with histological findings. 
There were no differences in survival between 
the autoimmunity and IPF groups, and both 
had worse survival than did those with known 
CTD. In yet another study, stringent criteria 
(CTD-specific symptoms and autoantibodies) 
were applied, and their accuracy in predicting 
NSIP was evaluated.(34) Of 100 patients with 
NSIP or UIP (as determined by surgical biopsy), 
21 had LDCTD, which accounted for 31% of all 
Researchers who had previously reported cases of 
idiopathic NSIP were invited to submit cases for 
review. Patients who, at the onset of pulmonary 
symptoms, met diagnostic criteria for CTD (or 
other diseases) were excluded from the analysis. 
The selected cases were considered idiopathic 
after a detailed evaluation performed by the 
multidisciplinary expert panel (including clinicians, 
radiologists, and pathologists), who subsequently 
studied the epidemiological, histological, and CT 
features. Of the 67 cases that were considered 
idiopathic, 43% had positive ANF and 23% had 
increased RF; Raynaud’s phenomenon and arthritis 
had been reported in 8% and 3%, respectively. 
The authors considered and confirmed the 
possibility of interstitial lung involvement as 
the initial or sole manifestation of CTD, or as a 
manifestation of LDCTD. In a report published 
in 2006, the expert panel concluded that NSIP 
is a distinct form of ILD; however, because of 
a possible association between NSIP and other 
forms, especially hypersensitivity pneumonitis and 
CTD, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach 
is required in order to establish a diagnosis of 
idiopathic NSIP.(17)
LDCTD
On the basis of the abovementioned report from 
the American Thoracic Society, various authors 
attempted to characterize patients presenting 
with histological features of NSIP and meeting 
the previously discussed diagnostic criteria for 
UCTD. Kinder et al. sought to determine whether 
idiopathic NSIP was actually the pulmonary 
manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disease 
and, consequently, the pulmonary manifestation 
of UCTD.(13) By applying their own criteria (which 
were considered permissive for including findings 
that have low specificity for autoimmunity, such 
as gastroesophageal reflux and ESR), which 
combined CTD symptoms with evidence of systemic 
inflammation (autoantibodies, inflammatory 
activity, or both), the authors identified, in a 
population of 285 patients with ILD, 28 cases 
without any other apparent cause. Most were 
female, were younger than 50 years of age, and 
complained of arthralgia, joint swelling, Raynaud’s 
phenomenon, and dysphagia more often than did 
patients who met no diagnostic criteria for UCTD. 
With the exception of digital clubbing, which was 
more prevalent in those with the idiopathic form 
(26% vs. 7%), there were no differences between

clinical criteria established by leading rheumatology 
societies worldwide, chief among which is the 
American College of Rheumatology. The primary 
criticism directed toward the use of these criteria 
is that they do not reflect the clinical reality.(19)
Chief among formes frustes of CTD are PSS sine 
scleroderma and amyopathic dermatomyositis, 
which are characterized by the absence of clinical 
findings that primarily characterize the diseases 
to which they are related.(36,38,51,52) The different 
criteria used in the LDCTD studies reviewed above 
do not escape this criticism, and LDCTD can 
often be characterized as occult CTD. 
Next, we discuss the major rheumatic diseases 
that can present as formes frustes and mimic ILD, 
and that can be mistaken for LDCTD in the absence 
of a high degree of clinical suspicion. Fischer et 
al. evaluated 37 patients with clinical features 
of antisynthetase syndrome, negative ANF, and 
negative anti-Jo-1 antibodies. In order to test the 
hypothesis that antisynthetase syndrome is an 
unrecognized cause of ILD, those patients were 
screened for other anti-tRNA synthetase antibodies, 
and 9 (24%) tested positive for anti-PL-7 or anti￾PL-12 antibodies.(41) In the presence of a high 
degree of clinical suspicion, a provisional diagnosis 
of antisynthetase syndrome can be established in 
those with Raynaud’s phenomenon, desquamation 
on the sides of the fingers (mechanic’s hands), 
arthritis, Gottron’s papules, and pulmonary fibrosis, 
even if they have tested negative for ANF and 
anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Therefore, screening for 
other anti-tRNA synthetase antibodies, basically 
anti-PL-7 and anti- PL-12 antibodies, increases 
the chance of a diagnosis of occult CTD.(39,53)
In another study, 38 patients with ILD and sicca 
syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or xerostomia) 
or abnormal levels of SS-associated autoantibodies 
(anti-Ro and anti-La) underwent labial salivary 
gland biopsy.(54) When biopsy was requested, none 
of the patients had a definable CTD. Thirteen 
patients (34%) had chronic sialadenitis, which, 
together with sicca syndrome, is diagnostic of 
SS.(55) Of those 13 patients, 3 tested negative 
for ANF, RF, anti-Ro antibodies, and anti-La 
antibodies, a finding that increases the possibility 
of CTD even in the absence of autoantibodies. 
The difficulty in and importance of identifying 
patients with CTD-associated ILD are therefore 
clear. All ILD patients should be screened for 
occult or early CTD in order to decrease the 
diagnosis of IIP, with prognostic and therapeutic 
cases of PINE and only 13% of all cases of UIP. 
Therefore, those strict criteria were three times 
more likely to be associated with NSIP histology, 
their sensitivity being 31% and their specificity 
being 88%. A poor accuracy in predicting this 
pattern is probably due to the fact that LDCTD 
can be associated with any known pattern of ILD. 
The two studies cited above(34,35) seem to 
characterize a population that is different from 
those in the studies by Kinder et al.(13) and Suda 
et al.(49) Can this difference be explained solely 
by differences among the study populations? 
Do these patients actually have UCTD and will 
rheumatologic criteria apply in this context of 
predominant ILD?(35,50) When this association was 
first recognized, NSIP was the most prevalent 
pattern. However, relevant data suggest that, 
if there are cases in which ILD is a pulmonary 
manifestation of systemic autoimmunity, the 
patterns of response to epithelial injury do 
vary. This constitutes an obstacle to the use of 
classifications or terms that originate from other 
specialties (such as UCTD), if not because such 
classifications and terms are well established then 
at least because of the clinical and epidemiological 
distinction described herein. In this context, we 
propose that the term LDCTD be used in order 
to aid in distinguishing such patients from those 
with UCTD and predominant joint involvement, 
as well as to aid in standardizing criteria that 
will allow pulmonologists to characterize such 
patients more precisely. Chart 2 presents stringent 
criteria for the diagnosis of LDCTD. The proposed 
criteria give weight to autoantibodies that are 
more specific to CTD and to higher titers of 
highly sensitive markers of autoimmunity. In 
addition, other causes for ILD or even well￾established CTD should be ruled out. However, 
the major difference between these and other 
criteria is that they recognize the possibility of 
classic patterns other than NSIP and allow the 
inclusion of histological findings suggestive of 
pulmonary involvement secondary to CTD. Figure 
1 shows CT and histological findings in a female 
patient with LDCTD after a 6-year follow-up 
period, during which she met no diagnostic 
criteria for CTD. 
Occult CTD
It is clearly difficult to distinguish between 
CTD-associated ILD and formes frustes of CTD. 
Rheumatic diseases are classified in accordance with 

736 Pereira DAS, Kawassaki AM, Baldi BG

recently been obtained. (19,42) In patients with 
PSS-associated ILD, the use of cyclophosphamide 
for 12 months, followed by maintenance therapy 
with azathioprine or mycophenolate, slows 
functional deterioration.(57,58) The therapeutic 
response in patients with LDCTD remains unclear. 
It remains unknown whether it is similar to the 
refractoriness in those with IPF or to the stability 
in those with PSS, or whether the possibility of 
partial or complete resolution exists. 
Another important point is patient prognosis. 
Most of the studies reviewed here showed that 
the prognosis of patients with CTD-associated 
ILD is better than is that of those with idiopathic 
forms. Park et al.(7) showed that survival was better 
in the group of patients with CTD-associated 
ILD than in that of those with IIP, the groups of 
patients with CTD-associated NSIP, idiopathic 
NSIP, and CTD-associated UIP having a similar 
prognosis. The group of patients with IPF had 
the worst prognosis. The authors concluded that 
patients with CTD-associated ILD (including 
those with CTD-associated UIP) had a better 
prognosis, screening for occult CTD or even 
frustes formes of CTD (such as LDCTD) being 
therefore justified. Suda et al. demonstrated 
that patients with NSIP and LDCTD have better 
5-year survival than do those with idiopathic 
NSIP.(49) In another study, in which the diagnostic 
criteria for LDCTD were adopted, lung histology 
revealed that the proportion of patients with UIP 
was much higher than was that of those with 
NSIP, and, despite the low mortality in the study 
population, their survival was better than was 
that of those with IPF.(35) However, these results 
were not reproduced in another study, in which 
strict criteria were also adopted.(34)
Therefore, prospective studies should be 
conducted in order to establish the real prognosis 
and the best treatment strategy for patients 
with LDCTD. 
Final considerations
The initial evaluation of patients with ILD 
involves a comprehensive, active search for the 
cause. Routine screening for autoantibodies allows 
the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases ranging from 
UCTD (a fruste forme of CTD) to a definable 
CTD. However, autoantibody positivity should be 
interpreted with caution, given that autoantibody 
assays are laboratory tests whose accuracy is 
limited in many cases. Autoantibody positivity 
implications. A multidisciplinary approach, 
involving pulmonologists, radiologists, pathologists, 
and rheumatologists, is recommended in order to 
overcome the limitations of current diagnostic 
criteria and the unavailability of autoantibody 
assays. 
How should patients with ILD be evaluated in 
terms of the presence of features of rheumatic 
disease? Chart 3 presents the main clinical, 
laboratory, radiological, and histological 
findings for an active search for patients with 
CTD-associated ILD. The presence of positive ANF 
titers ≥ 320 strongly suggests an association with 
rheumatic disease; however, as is the case with 
any other autoantibody, a positive ANF alone 
loses specificity unless certain highly specific 
immunofluorescence patterns (including a nucleolar 
pattern, a centromere pattern, and a cytoplasmic 
pattern) are found.(56) The hands should be routinely 
examined for changes suggestive of rheumatic 
disease. Mechanic’s hands and Gottron’s papules 
are associated with inflammatory myopathies 
and antisynthetase syndrome.(3) The presence of 
sclerodactyly, Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital 
pitting scars, and fingertip ulcers is suggestive 
of PSS, whereas the presence of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon, digital pitting scars, and fingertip 
ulcers without sclerodactyly is suggestive of PSS 
sine scleroderma.(3,51,52) Nailfold capillaroscopy 
is a technique that is used in order to evaluate 
microvascular involvement (which is quite common 
in patients with PSS), polymyositis/dermatomyositis, 
and mixed CTD.(36)
What is the importance of this 
discussion? What is the advantage 
of identifying rheumatic features in 
patients with ILD? 
There are various reasons why patients with ILD 
should be screened for features of CTD.(12) Initially, 
the identification of a CTD allows patients to gain 
a better understanding of their health problems 
and allows health professionals to seek lesions 
in organs that can also be affected by systemic 
autoimmunity.(12) Standardization of criteria 
allows researchers to conduct epidemiological 
studies that are more reproducible, allowing a 
better understanding of the natural history and 
prognosis of the disease in question. Regarding 
the treatment of ILDs, robust data regarding the 
efficacy or inefficacy of certain drugs have only

test results, the possibility of a false association 
of indeterminate clinical significance (which is 
due to the considerable sensitivity of some of 
these tests) should not be discarded. The clinical 
context, titers, and patterns, as well as which 
specific antibody test results were abnormal, 
are factors that will jointly contribute to the 
relevance of positive test results. 
Finally, in addition to recommending a 
multidisciplinary approach to patients with LDCTD, 
we suggest that LDCTD be defined as a distinct 
phenotype and as a classification of disease so 
that future studies can examine its prognostic, 
therapeutic, and biopathological implications.

formes frustes of connective tissue disease? 
in the general population, technical difficulties, 
and analytical errors are typical. Therefore, the 
diagnosis or suspicion of CTD should be associated 
with typical signs and symptoms. 
The terms LDCTD and UCTD are often treated 
as synonyms. However, studies investigating 
patients with UCTD show little joint morbidity 
and virtually no pulmonary involvement. The 
criteria used in the studies investigating patients 
with predominant respiratory disease and using 
the term UCTD lacked specificity, as well as 
having differed from study to study. Despite 
conflicting data, different terminology, varying 
inclusion criteria, and different views on the 
same issue, it seems that patients with LDCTD 
constitute a distinct population of patients 
with ILD. The hypothesis that the lung is the 
organ that is predominantly affected by systemic 
autoimmunity in such cases is now more likely 
than not. Although this hypothesis emerged from 
studies of idiopathic NSIP, it is possible that 
other patterns of ILD are involved. The immune 
system is highly complex, and very little is known 
regarding the orchestration of the distinction 
between self and non-self in innate and acquired 
immunity. What is the explanation for the finding 
of anti-PL-12 antibodies in patients with IPF, 
given that PL-12 is highly specific to rheumatic 
disease and that IPF is a highly fibrotic and 
poorly cellular disease? How can patients with 
well-defined CTD have prognostic features that 
are different from those of patients with LDCTD? 
Many questions remain unanswered, and 
many others will arise. However, this knowledge 
must be extrapolated to current daily practice. 
In approaching ILDs, it is essential to consider 
the possibility of CTD as the etiologic agent. 
Patients with ILD should be actively screened for 
extrapulmonary manifestations, such as Raynaud’s 
phenomenon, arthralgia, sicca symptoms, and 
gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, they 
should be routinely screened for rheumatoid 
antibodies, such as ANF, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-RNP, 
anti-Sm, anti-DNA, anti-Scl-70, RF, anti-CCP, 
and antisynthetase antibodies (especially anti￾Jo-1, given that the tests for the remaining 
antisynthetase antibodies are available only in 
the USA). In the presence of negative test results 
and a high degree of clinical suspicion of CTD, 
the possibility of repeating the tests should be 
taken into consideration because of the possibility 
of formes frustes.(14,56) In the presence of positive
