Abstract
Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a common and invariably fatal disease with limited therapeutic options.
Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 potassium channels play a key role in promoting TGFβ1 and bFGF-dependent profibrotic responses
in human lung myofibroblasts (HLMFs). We hypothesised that KCa3.1 channel-dependent cell processes regulate HLMF
αSMA expression via Smad2/3 signalling pathways.
Methods: In this study we have compared the phenotype of HLMFs derived from non-fibrotic healthy control lungs (NFC)
with cells derived from IPF lungs. HLMFs grown in vitro were examined for αSMA expression by immunofluorescence (IF),
RT-PCR and flow cytommetry. Basal Smad2/3 signalling was examined by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence.
Two specific and distinct KCa3.1 blockers (TRAM-34 200 nM and ICA-17043 [Senicapoc] 100 nM) were used to determine
their effects on HLMF differentiation and the Smad2/3 signalling pathways.
Results: IPF-derived HLMFs demonstrated increased constitutive expression of both α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)
and actin stress fibres, indicative of greater myofibroblast differentiation. This was associated with increased constitutive
Smad2/3 mRNA and protein expression, and increased Smad2/3 nuclear localisation. The increased Smad2/3 nuclear
localisation was inhibited by removing extracellular Ca2+ or blocking KCa3.1 ion channels with selective KCa3.1 blockers
(TRAM-34, ICA-17043). This was accompanied by de-differentiation of IPF-derived HLMFs towards a quiescent fibroblast
phenotype as demonstrated by reduced αSMA expression and reduced actin stress fibre formation.
Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that Ca2+- and KCa3.1-dependent processes facilitate “constitutive”
Smad2/3 signalling in IPF-derived fibroblasts, and thus promote fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Importantly,
inhibiting KCa3.1 channels reverses this process. Targeting KCa3.1 may therefore provide a novel and effective approach
for the treatment of IPF and there is the potential for the rapid translation of KCa3.1-directed therapy to the clinic.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has an unknown
etiology [1] and is marked by progressive lung fibrosis
leading to respiratory failure. The pathogenic mechanisms
involved in its initiation and progression are poorly
understood [2] and there are limited therapeutic options
with poor efficacy [3,4]. Prognosis is bleak with a median
survival of only 3 years, worse than many cancers [5]. IPF
patients present with a mean age of between 60 to 65 years
at diagnosis [4]. In the USA the overall incidence of IPF
is 16 per 100,000 person-years [2] and the incidence
is increasing by 11% annually in the UK [6]. The
most favoured hypothesis regarding its development is
that on-going multiple, microscopic, isolated episodes
of alveoli epithelial injury lead to an abnormal wound
healing response involving fibrotic repair mechanisms [7].
Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that serve a critical
role in both normal and fibrotic repair processes, which
when activated, become differentiated, highly secretory

and contractile smooth muscle-like cells termed myofibro￾blasts [8]. Expression of alpha smooth muscle actin
(αSMA) and αSMA-containing stress fibres is the hall￾mark of these cells [9-12]. IPF evolves from dysfunc￾tional interactions between the injured epithelium and
fibroblasts which lead to pathologic lesions called
fibroblast foci, which are comprised of activated myo￾fibroblasts [13]. In their activated state, myofibroblasts
are the primary cell responsible for the synthesis, secre￾tion and remodelling of the extracellular matrix in IPF
[14]. The human lung myofibroblast (HLMF) is there￾fore an attractive target for the treatment of IPF.
αSMA is a key protein expressed by HLMFs as com￾pared to quiescent fibroblasts [15], and contributes to the
formation of characteristic HLMF contractile stress fibres
[8,16,17]. αSMA expression and stress fibre formation in
myofibroblasts is regulated in part by the TGFβ1/Smad
signalling pathway [18,19]. Smads are intracellular pro￾teins which transduce TGFβ1-dependent signals. Follow￾ing binding of TGFβ1 to the TGFβRII, Smad2/3 are
phosphorylated and form hetero-oligomeric complexes
with Smad 4, leading to nuclear translocation and the regu￾lation of gene transcription [20]. They therefore regulate
many biological effects in HLMFs that are under the control
of TGFβ1, including collagen secretion, proliferation, differ￾entiation and contraction [18-21].
Ion channels are attractive therapeutic targets for many
chronic diseases including fibrosis. Activated intermediate
conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels promote several
pro-fibrotic processes in HLMFs such as basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF)-dependent proliferation, and TGFβ1-
dependent wound healing, collagen secretion and contrac￾tion [22]. KCa3.1 activity was also shown to contribute to
the upregulation of αSMA in response to TGFβ1 through
the enhancement of Smad phosphorylation [23], and
contributed to diabetic [24] and surgically-induced kidney
fibrosis in rodents [25]. However, much of the research
published to-date has focussed on the activity of myofibro￾blasts following TGFβ1 stimulation, and there are few
studies investigating basal signalling differences between
non fibrotic control (NFC) and IPF-derived myofibroblasts.
Previously, IPF-derived HLMFs demonstrated significantly
higher constitutive αSMA [26] and functional KCa3.1
channel expression [22] compared to NFC-derived cells.
However, whether these basal increases in αSMA in
IPF-derived HLMFs are due to altered constitutive Smad
pathway signalling or KCa3.1 activity is not known.
We therefore hypothesized that Smad2/3 signalling is
increased at baseline in IPF-derived HLMFs compared
to NFC cells, and if true, that this would be susceptible
to KCa3.1 channel inhibition. We therefore investigated
constitutive Smad2/3 nuclear localisation and αSMA
expression in NFC- and IPF-derived HLMFs, and the
role of KCa3.1 ion channels in these processes.
Materials and methods
Human lung myofibroblast isolation and culture
Non-fibrotic control (NFC) HLMFs were derived from
healthy areas of lung from patients undergoing lung
resection for carcinoma at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester,
UK. No morphological evidence of disease was found in
the tissue samples used for HLMF isolation. IPF HLMFs
were derived from patients undergoing lung biopsy for
diagnostic purposes at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, USA, and were shown to have UIP on
histological examination. Myofibroblasts were grown from
explanted lung tissue from both sources under identical
conditions, using DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
antibiotic/antimycotic agents and non-essential amino
acids [27,28]. The cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2/
95% air. Cells were studied at passages 4–5 for functional
studies. HLMFs were characterised as previously described
[22]. All NFC patients gave informed written consent
and the study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service (references 07/MRE08/42 and 10/H0402/
12). Written informed consent was also obtained from all
IPF subjects, in accordance with the responsible University
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.
Human myofibroblast characterisation
Human myofibroblasts were harvested from 80-90%
confluent monolayers with 0.1% trypsin/0.1% EDTA.
Cells were seeded into 8-well chamber slides, grown to
confluence, and to confirm a myofibroblast population the
cells were immunostained using the following antibodies:
FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle
actin (αSMA) (F3777, 10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole,
Dorset, UK); mouse monoclonal anti-fibroblast surface
protein(FSP)(F4771, 4 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich); mouse
monoclonal anti-fibroblast antigen THY-1 (CP28, 3 μg/ml,
Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; rabbit polyclonal collagen
type 1 (550346, 20 μg/ml, Millipore, Watford, UK), isotype
control rabbit IgG (20 μg/ml). To detect the presence of
contaminating cells the following antibodies were
used; monoclonal mouse CD68 antibody (6.4 μg/ml,
Dako) to detect the presence of macrophages, mast cells
and monocytes; mouse monoclonal CD3 (4.5 mg/ml
Dako) to detect T-cells, and mouse monoclonal CD34
R-PE antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Catlag) was also used to
detect progenitor cells. Secondary antibodies labelled with
FITC or R-PE (F0313, Dako) were applied and the cells
counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
Sigma-Aldrich). All isotype controls were negative. Cells
were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium and
cover-slipped. The results confirmed that the cells isolated
were of myofibroblast-rich population of cells (99%), with
no contaminating cells identified. Full details, results and
accompanying images have been previously published in
Roach et al. [22].

Immunofluorescence
HLMFs were grown on 8-well chamber slides and
serum-starved for 24 hours prior to the experiment.
The cells were then treated for 24 hours with either
0.1% DMSO, TRAM-34 (20 and 200 nM) or ICA-17043
(10 and 100 nM). Cells were then immunostained as
described previously [22] using FITC-conjugated mouse
monoclonal anti-α-SMA (F3777, 10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich,
Poole, Dorset, UK) and isotype control FITC-conjugated
mouse IgG2a (X0933, 10 μg/ml, Dako, Ely, UK). KCa3.1
expression was examined by immunofluorescence using
rabbit polyclonal anti-KCa3.1 (AV35098, 5 μg/ml, Sigma)
and appropriate isotype control. Secondary antibodies
labelled with FITC (F0313, Dako) were applied and the
cells counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were mounted with fluo￾rescent mounting medium and cover-slipped. Original
images were captured on an epifluorescent microscope
(Olympus BX50, Olympus UK Ltd, Southend–on-sea);
grey scale intensity was examined using Cell F imaging
software (Olympus UK Ltd). Matched exposures were
used for isotype controls.
Actin stress fibres were calculated using a specialised
macro on image J designed by Dr Kees Straatman,
University of Leicester. The macro is capable of providing
a quantitative, unbiased score of the number of stress
fibres per individual cell by determining the fluctuations
of grey scale intensity created by the αSMA staining
within the stress fibres.
Flow cytometry
Cells were grown on T25 flasks and serum-starved for
24 hours prior to the experiment. The myofibroblasts
were incubated for 24 hours in the presence of 0.1%
DMSO control, TRAM-34 (200 nM) or ICA-17043
(100 nM). Cells were detached using 0.1% trypsin/
0.1% EDTA, washed then fixed and permeabilised in 4%
paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% saponin (Sigma) respectively
for 20 minutes on ice. Myofibroblasts were labelled
with FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth
muscle actin (sigma) or isotype control FITC-conjugated
mouse IgG2a. Secondary antibodies labelled with FITC
(F0313, Dako) were applied. Analysis was performed using
single colour flow cytometry on a FACScan (BD, UK).
Smad nuclear localisation
HLMFs were grown on 8-well chamber slides and
serum-starved for 24 hours prior to the experiment. The
cells were then stimulated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) in
the presence of either 0.1% DMSO control, TRAM-34
(200 nM), ICA-17043 (100 nM) or Ca2+ free media. After
1 hour cells were immunostained using rabbit monoclonal
anti-Smad2/3 (0.174 μg/ml, Cell Signalling). Secondary
antibody labelled with FITC (F0313, Dako) was applied
and the cells counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium
and cover-slipped. Images were analysed as above. The
intensity of nuclear Smad2/3 staining was quantified
by measuring the grey scale intensity of DAPI positive
nuclei to whole cell staining.
Western blot for Smad proteins
Cells were grown in T75 flasks, serum starved for
24 hours, and then incubated with either 0.1% DMSO
control, TRAM-34 (200 nM), ICA-17043 (100 nM) or
Ca2+ free media for 1 hour. Cells were detached with
0.1% Trypsin/EDTA and washed. Protein was isolated
using the RIPA buffer lysis system (Santa Cruz, Germany)
and total protein concentration was determined using the
DC Bio-Rad protein Assay (Bio-Rad, UK). 30 μg of protein
was resolved using 10% Mini-Protean TGX precast gels
(Bio-Rad) and then transferred to an immunobilon-P
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, using Trans-blot
Turbo transfer packs (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked
with 5% milk and incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti￾phospho-Smad2/3 (0.231 μg/ml, Cell Signalling, USA),
rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad2/3 (0.0087 μg/ml, Cell
Signalling), mouse monoclonal anti-TATA binding protein
(TBP) (1 μg/ml, Abcam), or mouse monoclonal anti-β￾actin antibody (0.2 μg/ml, SantaCruz). Protein bands
were identified by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent (Amersham, UK). Immunolabelled proteins were
visualized using ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, UK).
Nuclear fraction
NFC and IPF-derived HLMFs were grown in T75 flasks,
serum starved for 24 hours, then detached with 0.1%
Trypsin/EDTA and washed. Nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts were isolated using the Nuclear Extract Kit
(Abcam, ab113474). Protein concentrations of both
nuclear and cytoplasmic extract was then was isolated
using the RIPA buffer lysis system determined using
the DC Bio-Rad protein Assay. Western blot was then
performed as described above.
qRT-PCR
Myofibroblast RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Kit
(Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Primers were designed for Smad2 , forward
CGTCCATCTTGCCATTCACG and reverse CTCAAGC
TCATCTAATCGTCCTG, product size 182 bp from NCB1
Reference sequence NM_005901.5; and Smad3, forward
GCGTGCGGCTCTACTACATC and reverse GCACATT
CGGGTCAACTGGTA product size 233 bp from reference
sequence NM_005902.3 β-actin primers were analysed
using gene-specific Quantitect Primer Assay primers

(Qiagen, Germany), HS_ACTB_1_SG. All expression data
were normalized to β-actin and corrected using the refer￾ence dye ROX. Gene expression was quantified by real-time
PCR using the Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR 1-Step
Master Mix (Strategene, The Netherlands). PCR products
were run on a 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the product
amplified was the correct size, and each of the products
were sequenced to confirm the specificity of the primers.
Statistical analysis
Experiments from an individual donor were performed
either in duplicate or triplicate and a mean value was
derived for each condition. Cells from 8 IPF and 8 NFC
donors were used, and the number of donors used for each
experimental condition is stated in the text and/or figure
legends. Data distribution across donors was tested for nor￾mality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For parametric
data the 1-way ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA for
across-group comparisons was used followed by the appro￾priate multiple comparison post hoc test; otherwise an
unpaired or paired t-test was used. For non-parametric data
the Friedman test was used for across group comparisons
followed by the appropriate multiple comparison post hoc
test, or the Mann Whitney U test was used where there
were two unpaired groups. GraphPad Prism for windows
(version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA)
was used for these analyses. A value of P < 0.05 was taken
to assume statistical significance and data are represented
as mean (± SEM) or median (IQR).
Results
IPF myofibroblasts have increased basal αSMA expression
and stress fibre formation
We and others have shown previously that fibroblasts
grown from lung parenchyma express relatively high levels
of αSMA and are contractile [22,29], in keeping with a
myofibroblast phenotype. Here both NFC and IPF-derived
HLMFs expressed αSMA protein, but this was signifi￾cantly increased in IPF derived cells when assessed by
immunofluorescent staining (P = 0.0111, Figure 1A and B),
western blot analysis (P = 0.0026, Figure 1C and D) and
flow cytometry, P = 0.0159 (Figures 1E and F).
Both NFC and IPF-derived cells displayed cytosolic
αSMA staining, but IPF-derived HLMFs displayed
obvious αSMA-positive stress fibres. Immunofluorescent
pictures were examined using an Image J macro which
measured the numbers of stress fibres per cell, this is
shown in Figure 1G. We found significantly more αSMA
positive stress fibres in IPF-derived cells in comparison to
NFC donors, P = 0.0437 (Figure 1H).
IPF myofibroblasts have increased basal KCa3.1 expression
Functional KCa3.1 channels are increased in IPF-derived
HLMFs [22]. We therefore examined the expression of
KCa3.1 by immunofluorescence and its relationship to
αSMA expression. We found that IPF-derived HLMFs
had a higher intensity of immunostaining than NFC
cells, (Figure 2A and B), in keeping with previous patch
clamp electrophysiology data [22]. Furthermore, KCa3.1
expression correlated significantly with both basal αSMA
expression, r = 0.79, P = 0.0176, and basal Smad2/3 local￾isation, r = 0.9245, P = 0.0029 in both NFC and IPF donors
(Figure 2C and D).
Smad2/3 expression is greater in IPF-derived HLMFs
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
observed phenoytypic differences between NFC- and
IPF-derived HLMFs we investigated the basal Smad2/3
content as Smad2/3 signalling is key for myofibroblast
differentiation and αSMA gene transcription RT-PCR
results confirmed that both Smad2 and Smad3 mRNA
were significantly upregulated in IPF-derived HLMFs
compared to NFC-derived cells, P = 0.0286 and P = 0.0286
respectively, Mann Whitney (Figure 3A and B). Smad3
mRNA was more highly expressed than Smad2 mRNA
(Figure 3C).
Total Smad2/3 protein expression was significantly
increased in IPF-derived HLMF donors compared to
NFC-derived cells, P = 0.0294, unpaired t test (Figure 3D
and E), although phosphorylated Smad2/3 was undetectable
in both IPF and NFC-derived cells. Immunofluorescent
staining revealed that constitutive Smad2/3 nuclear staining
was significantly greater in IPF-derived HLMFs in
comparison to NFC-derived cells, P = 0.0202, unpaired
t test (Figure 3F and G). To confirm the observed increased
nuclear staining of IPF-derived cells, Western blot was
performed examining total Smad2/3 protein expression
in the nuclear fraction and cytoplasmic extract of IPF and
NFC-derived cells. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were
probed for the nuclear protein, TATA box binding protein
(TBP) and β-actin to verify separation. As expected TBP
was observed primarily in the nuclear protein enriched
fractions, and served as a nuclear loading control for
analysis. β-actin was observed primarily in the cytoplasmic
protein enriched fractions and was used as the cytoplasmic
loading control for subsequent analysis. The results
demonstrate that IPF-derived HLMFs have significantly
greater amounts of total Smad2/3 within the nucleus and
cytoplasm in comparison to NFC HLMFs, P = 0.0488 and
P = 0.0454 respectively (Figure 3H,I and J). This suggests
that there may be increased constitutive Smad2/3 signalling
in IPF-derived HLMFs.
Constitutive Smad 2/3 expression is inhibited by KCa3.1
blockers and is Ca2+ dependent
KCa3.1 channel activity is important for profibrotic HLMF
processes such as proliferation, contraction and collagen
secretion [22]. Because the Smad2/3 pathway is a major

regulator of αSMA and collagen secretion [18,19,30], we
investigated whether the selective KCa3.1 blockers TRAM￾34 (20 and 200 nM)(Kd for TRAM-34 is 20 nM) [31] and
ICA-17043 (10 and 100 nM)(Kd for ICA-17043 is 10 nM)
[32] have inhibitory effects on the basal nuclear transloca￾tion of Smad2/3 in HLMFs. Using immunofluorescence
we found a significant reduction in the amount of Smad2/3
in the nucleus of HLMFs following 1 hour incubation with
TRAM-34 200 nM, P = 0.0008 (Figure 4A and B). Similarly,
ICA-17043 100 nM significantly inhibited Smad2/3 nuclear
staining, P = 0.0003 (Figure 4C and D).
KCa3.1 channel blockade depolarises the plasma mem￾brane and thereby reduces receptor-dependent rises in
intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in many cell types includ￾ing HLMFs [22,33-36]. If Ca2+ signalling is mechanistically
important for the effects of KCa3.1 blockers on constitutive
Smad2/3 nuclear translocation, lowering the extracellular
Ca2+ concentration should also inhibit nuclear transloca￾tion. Incubating HLMFs for 1 hour in Ca2+-free media
significantly reduced the amount of Smad2/3 in the nuclei
compared to cells incubated in media containing normal
external Ca2+ (1.8 mM), P = 0.0114 (Figure 5A and B). This
(See figure on previous page.)

by grey scale intensity in n = 7 NFC and n = 7 IPF donors; a minimum of 10 random cells were measured in one field for each donor. IPF HLMF’s had

in at least 10 cells in HLMFs from both NFC (n = 7) and IPF (n = 9) donors. IPF-derived HLMFs had a significantly higher proportion of Smad2/3
located in the nucleus compared to NFC-derived cells. (G) A representative illustration of total Smad2/3 expression assessed by immunofluorescence.

respectively, 38 kDa for TBP and 43 kDa for β-actin (I) Quantification of Western blot analysis confirmed that total Smad2/3 in the nuclear enriched
fraction is significantly increased in IPF cells (n = 3) in comparison to NFC cells (n = 3). Results were normalized to TBP. (J) Similarly, total Smad2/3 in
the cytoplasmic enriched fraction was increased in IPF cells (n = 3) in comparison to NFC-derived cells (n = 3). Results were normalized to β-actin.
Results are represented as mean ± IQR #P < 0.05 (Mann Whitney) or mean ± SEM *P = 0.05 (Un-paired t-test).

suggests that the enhancement of Ca2+-influx by KCa3.1
channels is an essential requirement for the efficient
nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 and subsequent tran￾scription and expression of αSMA.
αSMA expression in HLMF is inhibited by KCa3.1 blockers
Next we assessed whether the inhibition of constitutive
Smad2/3 nuclear translocation following KCa3.1 block
was associated with a reduction in αSMA expression
and thus de-differentiation of HLMFs back towards a
fibroblast phenotype. We therefore incubated both

Both TRAM-34 and ICA-17043 dose-dependently
inhibited the constitutive expression of HLMF αSMA

αSMA expression were also confirmed by flow cytometry
(P = 0.0078 for TRAM-34 and P = 0.0391 for ICA-17043)
(Figure 6E and F).

Figure 4 Basal nuclear total Smad2/3 expression is significantly attenuated by KCa3.1 blockers. (A) Constitutive nuclear Smad2/3
expression was significantly attenuated by the KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 (200 nM) (NFC n = 5 [triangles] and IPF n = 6 [circles] (data pooled for
statistical analysis, at least 10 cells were measured per donor). (B) Immunofluorescent images depict the reduced nuclear staining following 1 hour
of incubation with TRAM-34. (C and D) Similarly, ICA-17043 (100 nM) significantly reduced the proportion of total Smad2/3 staining within the
nuclei of HLMFs after a 1 hour incubation. Results are represented as mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05 (Paired t-test).

αSMA stress fibres in HLMF are reduced by KCa3.1 blockers
Following KCa3.1 inhibition the number of actin stress fi￾bres in both NFC and IPF-derived HLMFs were dose￾dependently inhibited by TRAM-34 (20 nM and 200 nM),
P = 0.0235 and ICA-17043 (10 nM and 100 nM), P =
0.0095, (Figure 7A and B). Thus not only is cytosolic
αSMA staining inhibited by KCa3.1 channel blockers
but also αSMA stress fibres, suggesting a phenotypic
transition from a myofibroblast into a more fibroblast-like
phenotype.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that IPF-derived HLMFs con￾stitutively overexpress αSMA and actin stress fibres

Figure 6 KCa3.1 channel inhibition reduces constitutive HLMF
αSMA expression. (A) The percentage of cells expressing αSMA was
dose-dependently decreased by TRAM-34 in NFC (n = 3) and IPF
(n = 3)-derived HLMFs (a minimum of 10 random cells were measured
in one field for each donor, data for NFC and IPF pooled for statistical
analysis). (B) Similarly, αSMA expression was dose-dependently
attenuated by ICA-17043 in NFC (n = 5) and IPF (n = 3)-derived HLMFs
(data pooled for statistical analysis). No differences were evident between
NFC and IPF-derived cells. (C) Representative immunofluorescent images

molecules without channel blocking activity, TRAM-85 and TRAM-7,
did not reduce constitutive αSMA expression in NFC (n = 2) and IPF
(n = 2)-derived HLMFs (data pooled, P < 0.999 and p = 0.1244 respectively).
(E and F) The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of constitutive αSMA
expression was also assessed by flow cytometry. TRAM-34 (200 nM) (E),
and ICA-17043 (100 nM) (F), again reduced αSMA expression significantly
in NFC (n = 4) and IPF (n = 4)-derived HLMFs (data pooled for statistical
analysis). Results are represented as mean ± SEM ***P < 0.0001

together with an increase in constitutive Smad2/3 nuclear
localisation when compared to NFC cells. The increased
constitutive Smad2/3 nuclear localisation was heavily
reliant on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and was
inhibited by selective KCa3.1 ion channel blockers.
Taken together, these data suggest that increased basal
Ca2+- and KCa3.1-dependent processes facilitate “consti￾tutive” Smad2/3 signalling in IPF-derived fibroblasts,
and thus promote fibroblast to myofibroblast differen￾tiation. Importantly, inhibiting KCa3.1 channels re￾versed this process.
Phenotypically both NFC and IPF-derived human lung
parenchymal fibroblasts in culture demonstrate the classic
fibroblast-like elongated morphology [21,22,37]. Previous
work has shown that healthy lung parenchymal fibro￾blasts express high levels of αSMA and display upregu￾lated genes associated with actin binding and
cytoskeletal organisation together with up-regulation of
activated Smad2 and Smad3 when compared to airway
fibroblasts from the same donors [21]. These cultured
lung parenchymal fibroblasts therefore have features of
a myofibroblast phenotype, hence we describe them as
HLMFs. Of note, IPF-derived HLMFs express higher con￾centrations of αSMA than cells from healthy lung [26,38],
a finding we have confirmed here. In addition to this, we
found that IPF-derived cells exhibited increased actin
stress fibre formation and cytoskeletal organisation com￾pared to NFC cells. We also found that IPF-derived
HLMFs, without TGFβ1 stimulation, have significantly
higher constitutive total Smad2/3 protein expression,
greater Smad2/3 expression within the nucleus and
higher Smad2 and Smad3 mRNA expression when com￾pared to NFC control cells. Smad3 in particular was im￾plicated in driving the myofibroblast phenotype in
healthy parenchymal HLMFs [21], and while we found
that both Smad2 and Smad3 mRNA were increased in
IPF-derived HLMFs, Smad3 mRNA was significantly
higher than Smad2 in both NFC and IPF-derived cells.
This supports the work of Zhou et al. [21], but shows
that differential Smad2 versus Smad3 mRNA expression
persists in IPF-derived cells. Thus while healthy paren￾chymal lung fibroblasts exhibit features of a myofibro￾blast phenotype, this is significantly more pronounced in
IPF-derived myofibroblasts.
The mechanism behind this increased constitutive
myofibroblast differentiation in IPF-derived cells is unclear
and potentially multi-factorial. That such a phenotypic
difference persists for several passages in cell culture sug￾gests that genetic or epigenetic factors may contribute [39].
Whether pre-programmed by genetics, or re-programmed
by epigenetics, IPF-derived HLMFs clearly have the
potential to perpetuate the fibrotic process. Reversing
this pro-fibrotic phenotype is therefore an important
goal therapeutically.

Irrespective of the point from where pathological
HLMF differentiation occurs in IPF, we have shown that
KCa3.1 channels play a key role in this process. By patch
clamp electrophysiology we have shown previously that
functional KCa3.1 ion channels are increased in IPF-derived
HLMFs [22], and we found increased KCa3.1 ion channel
protein in this study. Importantly, we have shown here that
blocking KCa3.1 channels has the unique ability to de￾differentiate HLMFs towards a fibroblast phenotype as indi￾cated by a marked reduction in αSMA protein and stress
fibre formation. This appears to operate via Ca2+-dependent
processes as the reduction in constitutive nuclear Smad2/3
expression induced by KCa3.1 blockers was mimicked by re￾moving extracellular Ca2+, and KCa3.1 channel activity is
known to influence intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in
many cell types [34,35,40-42]. For example, we demon￾strated previously that KCa3.1 activity is required for a rise
in intracellular Ca2+ that occurs following exposure of
HLMFs to TGFβ1 [22].
Previous studies have focused mainly on TGFβ1-
dependent Smad2/3 processes and have been contradictory
with regards to the role of Ca2+. A study on oesteoblasts
showed that a TGFβ1-dependent Ca2+ signal was not
required for Smad2 phosphorylation [43] where as in
kidney fibroblasts, TGFβ1-dependent Smad function
was controlled directly by Ca2+-calmodulin [44]. We
found that constitutive Smad2/3 nuclear localisation is
highly dependent on Ca2+ and KCa3.1 channel activity.
This suggests that the contribution of Ca2+ signals and
KCa3.1 activity to Smad2/3 signalling may be cell-specific.
This well documented heterogeneity in fibroblast biology
highlights the importance of studying cells from the
relevant species and tissue of interest. Thus these data
from primary IPF-derived HLMFs demonstrate the
potential of KCa3.1 as a target for IPF.
The increased nuclear localisation of Smad2/3 in IPF￾derived HLMFs in association with increased αSMA actin
and KCa3.1 expression, and the parallel reductions in
Smad2/3 nuclear localisation and αSMA expression fol￾lowing KCa3.1 blockade, suggest that Smad2/3 signalling is
likely to be increased constitutively in IPF-derived cells.
However, we were unable to observe phosphoSmad2/3 in
the cytoplasm or nucleus. Under these basal conditions,
phosphoSmad2/3 might be below the limit of detection,
and dephosphorylation within the nucleus may be rela￾tively dominant without a strong exogenous stimulus. For
Smad2/3 to enter the nucleus, prior phosphorylation is a
requirement [20,45], so it likely that there is increased
constitutive Smad2/3 activation in IPF-derived HLMFs.
Further experiments will be required to prove this defini￾tively. Similarly, it is likely that KCa3.1 is operating to
control αSMA expression via regulation of Smad2/3 sig￾nalling, but further experiments involving Smad2/3 down￾regulation would be required to confirm this.
We used two distinct and selective KCa3.1 blockers at the
IC50 (20 nM for TRAM-34 and 10 nM for ICA-17043) and
at 10× the IC50 where >95% of channels will be blocked.
These concentrations are physiologically relevant, and fur￾thermore, two structurally similar drugs without channel
blocking activity, TRAM-7 and TRAM-85, were without ef￾fect here and in previous experiments [22]. Importantly,
the concentration of ICA-17043 used here can be achieved
in vivo in humans with oral dosing [46], indicating that
the targeting of KCa3.1 in IPF is feasible.
Conclusion
KCa3.1 channel inhibition attenuates many TGFβ1- and
bFGF-dependent profibrotic activities in HLMFs [22].
However, as shown here, blocking KCa3.1 channels
promotes the de-differentiation of IPF-derived HLMFs
towards a quiescent fibroblast phenotype. This suggests
that KCa3.1-dependent cell processes may be a common
denominator in IPF pathophysiology. KCa3.1 knockout
animals are relatively healthy, and the KCa3.1 blocker
ICA-17043 (Senicapoc), when delivered orally, was well
tolerated for 12 months in a phase III clinical trial of sickle
cell disease [46]. Targeting KCa3.1 may therefore provide a
novel and effective approach for the treatment of IPF
and there is the potential for the rapid translation of
KCa3.1-directed therapy to the clinic.
