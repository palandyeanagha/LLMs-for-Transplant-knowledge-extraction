The recent report by Caly et  al., describing the anti￾viral potential of ivermectin against the  severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
in  vitro arrive to the agenda  of potential candidates for 
COVID-19 treatment [1]. This discovery gave hope to 
the researchers who are screening for drugs that can be 
repurposed for treating the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Ivermectin, is a member of the avermec￾tin family (Fig. 1); as these compounds are produced by 
the soil microorganism, Streptomyces avermitilis, they 
are called avermectins [2]. Ivermectin has showed a wide 
range of activities, ranging from broad-spectrum endo/
ecto-parasiticide activity to antiviral, antibacterial, and 
anticancer activities [3]. It was first introduced commer￾cially in 1981 for use in animals. In addition to being used 
for treating billions of livestock and companion animals 
worldwide to help maintain food production and ani￾mal health, ivermectin is also used for treating several 
diseases in humans, e.g. a key drug in the elimination 
programs of onchocercosis [3, 4]. Ivermectin is consid￾ered a drug of choice for various parasitic diseases. As 
an anthelmintic drug, its mechanism of action in inver￾tebrates mainly involves the opening of glutamate-gated 
and Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride 
channels, leading to increased conductance of chloride 
ions and causing subsequent motor paralysis in parasites 
[5].
This is not the first time that ivermectin has exhibited 
antiviral potential against human and animal viruses. 
The first report on the in vivo effectiveness of ivermectin 
against viruses demonstrated its effect against parvovi￾ruses in a freshwater crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) 
model [6]. This broad-spectrum endo/ecto-parasiticide 
has exhibited potent antiviral effects against several ribo￾nucleic acid (RNA) viruses, such as Zika virus [7], influ￾enza A virus [8], Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 
[9], West Nile virus [10], porcine reproductive and respir￾atory syndrome virus [11], Newcastle disease virus [12], 
chikungunya virus [13], human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV-1) [14], yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Japanese 
encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus [15]. 
However, the in vivo antiviral potential of ivermectin has 
only been reported against the West Nile virus [10] and 
Newcastle disease virus [12]. It has been demonstrated 
that ivermectin showed strong antiviral activity against 
Newcastle disease virus at a concentration of 100  μg/
ml, and exerted cytotoxicity in primary chick fibroblast 
cells [12]. Ivermectin has also exhibited antiviral activity 
against deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses, such as the 
pseudorabies virus [16], porcine circovirus 2 [17], parvo￾viruses [6], and bovine herpesvirus 1 [18]. However, the 
in  vivo antiviral potential of ivermectin has only been 
reported against the pseudorabies virus [16] and parvo￾viruses [6].
In the study by Caly et  al., Vero-hSLAM cells were 
treated with ivermectin after 2 h of SARS-CoV-2 infec￾tion, resulting in ~5000-fold reduction in viral RNA

after 48  h [1]. Although the positive result obtained in 
the in  vitro studies suggests the possible in  vivo antivi￾ral potential of ivermectin, further validation using an 
efficient in  vivo model is still required. As a matter of 
concern, we should also consider our previous experi￾ence with the in  vivo antiviral potential of ivermectin 
against the Zika virus. Even though its antiviral activ￾ity was proven in vitro [7], ivermectin was ineffective at 
preventing lethal Zika virus (Senegal strain) infection in 
Ifnar1-knockout mice [19]. Even though ivermectin has 
exhibited antiviral activity against several RNA viruses 
in vitro, further studies in in vivo models have been con￾ducted against only a few of these viruses [10, 12].
Ivermectin was previously found to inhibit flavivirus 
replication by specifically targeting the activity of non￾structural 3 helicase (NS3 helicase) in vitro. It is a potent 
inhibitor of the yellow fever virus and a weak inhibitor 
of other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, den￾gue, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses [15]. Ivermectin 
was also found to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of 
HIV-1 integrase and the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) 
polymerase of the dengue virus, a phenomenon that is 
dependent on importin α/β nuclear transport [14]. The 
broad-spectrum antiviral potential of ivermectin against 
several RNA viruses is due to its ability to specifically 
inhibit importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport, which 
in turn blocks the nuclear trafficking of viral proteins 
[20]. Several RNA viruses depend on Impα/β1 during the 
process of infection [21]. SARS-CoV-2, is an RNA virus, 
is expected to show a similar mechanism of action. The 
proposed anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of ivermectin involves 
the binding of ivermectin to the Impα/β1 heterodimer, 
leading to its destabilization and prevention of Impα/
β1binding to the viral proteins. This prevents viral pro￾teins from entering the nucleus, thereby reducing the 
inhibition of antiviral responses and leading to an effi￾cient antiviral response [1].
The antiviral activity of ivermectin is also found to 
be related to other mechanisms. Ivermectin has been 
reported to suppress the replication of the pseudora￾bies virus by inhibiting the nuclear import of UL42 (an 
accessory subunit of DNA polymerase) [16]. A similar 
mechanism of inhibition was reported for another DNA 
virus, bovine herpesvirus 1 [18]. Ivermectin inhibits the 
nuclear localization signal-mediated import of capsid 
protein (Cap) of porcine circovirus 2 [17]. It is, therefore, 
necessary to identify the exact mechanism underlying 
the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin against SARS￾CoV-2 to obtain an insight into the possible mechanism 
of infection. An overview of the potential modes of the 
antiviral action of ivermectin is presented in Fig. 2.
It has also been hypothesized that combination therapy 
using hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin may exert a 
synergistic inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. In this com￾bination, hydroxychloroquine acts by inhibiting the entry 
of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells, whereas ivermectin 
further enhances the antiviral activity by inhibiting viral 
replication [22]. Considering the promising result of the 
Fig. 1 Chemical structure of ivermectin, the 22, 23-dihydro derivative of a macrocyclic lactone avermectin B1

Sharun et al. Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob (2020) 19:23 Page 3 of 5
in  vitro study, the clinical benefit of ivermectin therapy 
was evaluated in an observational registry-based study 
involving critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. 
Treatment with ivermectin at a dose of 150  μg/kg was 
found to be associated with a lower mortality rate and 
reduced healthcare resource use [23]. Even though the 
result of this preliminary study provides hope for the uti￾lization of ivermectin in a clinical setting, further evalu￾ation in randomized clinical control trials is required 
before this wonder drug can be adapted into treatment 
guidelines, as has been occurring with other drugs under 
use and investigation in COVID-19, such as chloroquine 
[24].
Besides, although ivermectin has been reported to 
exert potent antiviral activity against many viruses, its 
application is mainly hampered by pharmacokinetic 
problems such as high cytotoxicity and low solubility. 
To overcome these problems, various liposomal systems 
have been engineered and used as ivermectin nano￾carriers in several cell lines, which resulted in lower 
cytotoxicity than that of free ivermectin [25]. Before 
considering ivermectin for widespread use as an antivi￾ral agent, detailed in vivo and in vitro investigations of its 
effect in various animal models and cell culture systems 
are of utmost importance.
The in  vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin against 
SARS-CoV-2 has further extended the antiviral spec￾trum of this drug. As ivermectin is an United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug, 
repurposing it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy will not 
be a problem. Nevertheless, the real question is, will it 
reach the stage of randomized clinical control trials in 
Fig. 2 Potential modes of anti-viral actions of ivermectin

Sharun et al. Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob (2020) 19:23 Page 4 of 5
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, or will it fail in the in vivo 
study stage? Although no clinical trials have reported its 
efficacy and safety in the context of COVID-19 yet, is 
expected to see in the near future them, delivering infor￾mation about its potential therapeutic action in the clini￾cal setting.
Hence, we can conclude the following:
• Ivermectin exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity 
against several animal and human viruses, including 
both RNA and DNA viruses.
• The antiviral potential of ivermectin against various 
viruses is mediated via the targeting of the following: 
importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport of HIV-1 
integrase and NS5 polymerase; NS3 helicase; nuclear 
import of UL42; and nuclear localization signal￾mediated nuclear import of Cap.
• As SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, the antiviral activ￾ity of ivermectin may be mediated through the inhi￾bition of importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport of 
viral proteins.
• The clinical efficacy and utility of ivermectin in 
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are unpredictable at 
this stage, as we are dealing with a completely novel 
virus.
