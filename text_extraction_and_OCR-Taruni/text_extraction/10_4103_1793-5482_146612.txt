hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage, are usually 
seen in the initial computed tomography (CT) scan.
Acute subdural hematomas are rarely reported in the 
literature. They are frequently due to injury at cerebral 
bridging veins secondary to head trauma.[13] ASDHs generally 
begin to be symptomatic within 72 h and usually occur in 
young adults.
Spontaneous ASDH is an unusual event, but it is a serious 
condition. The reported incidences of spontaneous ASDHs 
relative to total ASDHs have ranged from 2 to 6.7%.[14‑16]
Risk factors for the development of these hematomas include 
conditions such as hypertension, vascular abnormalities(such 
as aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation), or consumption 
of anticoagulant.[17]
Pharmacologic therapy linked with the development of 
spontaneous ASDH includes especially aspirin,[14,18] heparin,[14]
and warfarin.[14,19‑21]
Other reports of spontaneous ASDH mention risk factors 
such as coagulopathies related to coagulation factor 
deficiencies.[13,22,23] Mortality rate has been reported to be 
between 60% and 76.5%.[24,25]
Oral anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of SDH 4‑to 
15‑fold.[26] The rate of oral anticoagulant (OAC)‑associated 
SDH is related to the intensity of anticoagulation,[3] advanced 
patient age,[13] and perhaps cerebral atrophy.
The absolute rate of SDH can be estimated as approximately 
0.2%/y in elderly patients given Oral anticoagulant (OAC) 
(international normalised ratio [INR] =3).
Introduction
Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately 
10-15% of all cases of stroke, and it is associated with a high 
mortality rate.[1]
Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) often occurs in elderly 
patients, many of whom are treated with anticoagulants, 
which are known to increase the risk of bleeding events.[2,3]
Oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) is associated with a high 
risk of ICH, even after minor head trauma.[2,4‑8] As a result, TBI 
patients with coagulopathy are included in a high‑risk group 
regardless of clinical presentation.[5,9‑12]
The European Federation of Neurological Societies recommends 
that patients with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15 after mild 
TBI who are over 60 years of age or who are on anticoagulation, 
need to be admitted to the hospital for 24‑h observation.
Posttraumatic ICHs, including epidural hematoma, subdural 
hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral

Acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) are rarely reported in the literature. In general, it is due to head trauma, but if 
the traumatic event is very mild, it is inadequate to explain the ASDH occurrence. Risk factors for the development of 
spontaneous ASDH include hypertension, vascular abnormalities and deficit of coagulation. We present two cases of ASDH 
in patients with the coagulation deficit and review of the literature to understand the coagulation factors role and platelet 
role in the management of ASDHs.

Infusion of prothrombin complex concentrate appeared to 
reverse the coagulopathy more rapidly than fresh frozen plasma 
and was associated with improved outcome in one small study.[27]
Early surgical intervention is generally imperative for 
hematomas with significant mass effect.
The survival rate for surgery within 4 h of acute onset 
compared with surgery after 4 h is 50-0%, respectively.[25] Other 
favorable variables include a high GCS score upon admission, 
appropriate pupillary reactivity, and young age.[25]
We present two cases of ASDH in patients with the coagulation 
deficit:
• Female patient with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis
• Male patient with a history of cardiac surgery in OAC.
The female patient, aged 59 arrived in an emergency room of 
our hospital at 9.30 a.m.
On admission to the hospital, the patient presented loss of 
consciousness, isocoria, midriasis and appropriate pupillary 
reactivity, decerebration extension at pain response, 
GCS 5 (E1, V1, M3).
Patient’s husband referred a mild TBI after fall at 11.30 p.m. of 
the day before, history of alcoholic cirrhosis, HBV- and HCV-, 
with esophageal varix (Grade I), severe platelet deficiency in 
pancitopenia.
In an emergency room, the anesthesiologist stabilized the 
patient.
Patient underwent to the neuroimaging examination. CT scan 
showed acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) on left cerebral 
hemisphere with important midline structure shift, edema 
and indirect signs of ischemia [Figure 1]. The patient was 
diagnosed with ASDH.
After diagnosis patient was treated with a liquid infusion, 
Vitamin K, Voluven and proton pump inhibitor drugs before 
neurosurgical operation.
Decompressive pterional craniotomy was performed, 
and SDH was removed [Figure 2]. During the operation 
occurred hematemesis and melena. These events required 
hemotransfusion and endoscopic hemostasis of esophago￾gastric bleeding.
She was conducted in the resuscitation room, and she died 
2 days later for cardiac arrest.
A male patient, 58-year-old, arrived in an emergency room of 
our hospital complaining an increasing headache, dizziness 
and vomiting.
On admission to the hospital, he referred a history 
of cardiac surgery for mitral valve replacement in 
2008 and medical therapy with coumadin ‑ 5 mg and 
cordarone ‑ 20 mg. He denied recent trauma. At neurological 
examination he was disoriented, confused, presented 
isocoria and absence of focal deficits. Patient underwent to 
neuroimaging examination. CT scan showed bilateral ASDH 
in fronto‑temporo‑parietal region more thickness in the left 
hemisphere, compressive effect on sovratentorial ventricular 
system and edema [Figure 3].
Coagualation parameters showed: INR = 2.98, aPtt = 51.3 s., 
derivated fibrinogen = 491 mg/dl, platelet = 116000/mm3
.
Neurosurgical operation was delayed for preservation of 
consciousness state and presence of coagulative deficiency. 
The patient was treated with physiology and the electrolytic 
solution, Fenobarbital, Amiodarone and LMWE to replace OAT 
and adjust coagulative abset.
The day after INR was 2.79, aPtt=49.6 s., fibrinogen=579mg/dl, 
platelet = 117000/mm3
.

In the fourth hospitalization day his coagulation parameters 
were INR = 1.40, activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) =34.4 s., fibrinogen = 663 mg/dl, 
platelet = 114000/mm3
. Because of consciousness falling, he 
retried a CT scan that showed an increase of the hematoma. 
For these reasons he was immediately treated with a 
neurosurgical operation.
Methodology
We report two cases of ASDH in uncoagulated patients:
• Female patient, 59‑year‑old, history of cirrhosis
• Male patient, 58‑year‑old, history of mitral valve 
replacement.
A literature search using PubMed MEDLINE database has 
been performed. The search terms “nontraumatic ASDH,” 
“spontaneous ASDH,” were combined with the following 
terms: “Platelet deficit,” “coagulation deficit.”
Discussion
In this review of the literature, we compared the incidence 
of platelet deficiency with dysfunction of coagulation factors 
in ASDHs.
All conditions resulting in a low platelet count can predispose 
a patient to ICH. Thrombocytopenia has multiple causes, and 
one common classification scheme is as follows:
• Decreased platelet production, as seen in certain congenital 
disorders and cases of bone marrow damage (due to 
radiation, drugs)
• Increased platelet destruction
• Abnormal sequestration, usually in the spleen, as in 
cirrhosis
• Multiple causes, as commonly seen in alcoholics.
Intracranial hemorrhage cases induced by thrombocytopenia 
have been linked to use of certain drugs, as well as to uremia, 
alcohol use, and liver transplants.
A large number of abnormalities of hemostasis were 
demonstrated in alcoholics patients.
Thrombocytopenia in these patients is due to associated folate 
deficiency, splenic sequestration and direct toxic effects of 
alcohol on the bone marrow. Numerous functional deficits have 
also been described in the platelets of alcoholics, which are 
associated with disturbances in ultrastructural morphology.[28]
The largest study to date on alcohol use and ICH were 
conducted by the Honolulu Heart Program, which followed 
8006 men between 1965 and 1977 in a prospective study of 
cardiovascular disease.
Data results further indicated that the alcohol had a greater 
effect on ICH that were subarachnoid in origin, conferring 
a 3-4‑fold increased risk for moderate and heavy drinkers 
compared with nondrinkers.[29] No study was conducted to 
verify the incidence of ASDHs in alcoholics.
A lot of drugs have been associated with thrombocytopenia, 
including certain cytotoxic drugs, antimalarial agents, 
antiepileptic medications, furosemide, digoxin, and 
estrogens.[30] Any of these drugs could theoretically cause 
thrombocytopenia that could in turn contribute to ICH in a 
patient, especially one with other risk factors.
In a 1995 review, Hart, et al., suggested that anticoagulation 
to a “therapeutic” INR of 2.5-4.5 increases annual risk of ICH 
by 7-10‑fold, to an absolute rate of nearly 1% for high‑risk 
patient groups. Evaluation of individual large series shows 
great variation in the incidence of anticoagulation‑treated 
patients in whom ICH is a complication, with annual incidences 
ranging from 0.1% in a 1974 study of 3862 patients to 2.2% 
in a 1993 study of 186 patients.[31]
The most common antiplatelet agent in the world is aspirin. 
Aspirin works by irreversibly inactivating the enzyme 
cyclooxygenase, which results in decreased production 
of the natural platelet aggregate thromboxane A2.[32] The 
aspirin therapy is indicated for primary or secondary stroke 
prevention and primary myocardial infarction prevention, 
may slightly increase the low baseline risk of ICH, but the 
increased risk is usually outweighed by the benefits of 
aspirin.
Aspirin‑related ICH has been studied in detail.
The first suggestion that increased incidence of ICH might 
be a complication in aspirin users is found in Physician’s 
Health Study, which reported 23 hemorrhagic strokes among 
11,037 individuals receiving low‑dose aspirin (325 mg 
every other day) compared with 12 hemorrhagic strokes 
in 11,034 individuals receiving placebo. This finding 
was considered noteworthy but of borderline statistical 
significance (P = 0.06).[33]
In addition to aspirin, other antiplatelet agents that have 
grown in popularity in recent years include clopidogrel,[34]
Figure 3: CT scan showed bilateral ASDH

Vol. 9, Issue 4, October‑December 2014
abciximab,[35] as well as aspirin combined with extended‑release 
dipyridamole.[36] Clopidogrel, abciximab, and dipyridamole all 
act as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in slightly different ways 
and have different indications [Table 1].
In a small number of studies, the authors have examined 
the risk of ICH in patients receiving these newer antiplatelet 
agents.
The most comprehensive data are derived from a metaanalysis 
conducted by Memon et al.,[37] in which the authors evaluated 
14 randomized trials of intravenous platelet glycoprotein IIb/
IIIa receptor inhibitors. The results of the aforementioned 
metaanalysis, while suggesting that intravenous glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors did not increase the risk of ICH in 
anticoagulant‑treated patients, failed to provide information 
on the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in patients receiving 
oral formulations of the medications alone. The authors 
also compared glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors with a more 
commonly used antiplatelet agent: Aspirin.
Analysis of current data suggests that the newer antiplatelet 
agents discussed thus seem to be associated with an ICH risk 
profile similar to that of aspirin.
Warfarin, heparin, and enoxaparin are currently the most 
commonly used anticoagulants.
Warfarin is an OAC that interferes with vitamin K metabolism 
in the liver and results in the synthesis of nonfunctional 
coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S.
Warfarin thus prolongs the PT and is monitored by assessing 
a standardized form of this test known as the INR.
Heparin, on the other hand, is a parenterally administered 
anticoagulant agent that acts by potentiating the action of both 
antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), 
thus prolonging the PTT.[38]
Enoxaparin is the most commonly used member of a relatively 
new class of anticoagulants known as low molecular weight 
heparins. It is obtained by alkaline degradation of heparin 
benzyl ester and is approximately one third the molecular size 
of standard heparin. The mechanism of action of enoxaparin 
is similar to that of heparin, although enoxaparin has a longer 
half‑life (4.5 compared with 1.1 h) and does not require PTT 
monitoring.[39,40]
Anticoagulation‑related bleeding is clinically similar for each of 
the aforementioned drugs and accounts for 10-20% of all ICHs 
in different series.[41‑43] Furthermore, ICH is the most dreaded 
and least treatable complication of anticoagulation therapy.[44] 
Aspirin appears to double the risk for ICH, regardless of 
the dose.[45] The combination of aspirin with warfarin 
probably increases the risk for ICH over similar intensities 
of anticoagulation without aspirin (pooled data from four 
randomized trials of OACs show 15 ICHs with aspirin 
100-1000 mg/d versus 7 without aspirin).[31]
In the second Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation study, 
investigators showed that the occurrence of ICH actually 
negated the reduction in ischemic stroke among older 
hypertensive patients receiving warfarin.[46]
Approximately, 70% of ICH episodes associated with 
anticoagulation consist of intraparenchymal (cerebral) 
hemorrhage, whereas most of the remainder are SDHs.[3]
Conclusion
Coagulation and/or bleeding disorders account only for a 
small but significant risk factor associated with ICH. Blood 
coagulation and platelet‑mediated hemostasis are the two 
important defense mechanisms against bleeding.
Anticoagulant mechanisms ensure careful control of 
coagulation and under normal conditions, prevail over the 
procoagulant forces. In the CNS, however, an imbalance 
between pro‑ and anticoagulant systems due to inherited or 
acquired factors may result in bleeding or thrombotic diseases.
Spontaneous ASDH is a nosological entity rare but extremely 
serious. In our view it would be appropriate to perform a series 
of study to understand the most appropriate medical therapy 
in the management of disease: Is more useful adjust platelet 
deficiency, coagulation factors disorder, or both?
