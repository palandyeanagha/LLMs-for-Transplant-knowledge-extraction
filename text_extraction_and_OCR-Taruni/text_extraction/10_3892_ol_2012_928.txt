Abstract. Metabolic activities in normal cells rely primarily 
on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to 
generate ATP for energy. Unlike in normal cells, glycolysis is 
enhanced and OXPHOS capacity is reduced in various cancer 
cells. It has long been believed that the glycolytic phenotype 
in cancer is due to a permanent impairment of mitochondrial 
OXPHOS, as proposed by Otto Warburg. This view is chal￾lenged by recent investigations which find that the function 
of mitochondrial OXPHOS in most cancers is intact. Aerobic 
glycolysis in many cancers is the combined result of various 
factors such as oncogenes, tumor suppressors, a hypoxic 
microenvironment, mtDNA mutations, genetic background 
and others. Understanding the features and complexity of the 
cancer energy metabolism will help to develop new approaches 
in early diagnosis and effectively target therapy of cancer.

1. Introduction
Energy consumption from metabolic activities in normal cells 
relies primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS), which is efficient and generates more adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) than glycolysis. However, one of the 
metabolic features of cancer cells is to avidly take up glucose 
for aerobic glycolysis. This inefficient pathway for energy 
production in cancer cells was first described by German 
scientist Otto Warburg in the 1920s, and is also known as the 
Warburg effect (1).
Warburg originally proposed that the aerobic glycolysis in 
cancer cells was due to a permanent impairment of mitochon￾drial OXPHOS. However, this view is challenged by recent 
investigations which found that defects of mitochondrial 
OXPHOS are not common in spontaneous tumors (2) and that 
the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS in most cancers is 
intact (1,3‑7). Aerobic glycolysis in many cancers is a result 
driven by various factors, such as activation of oncogenes, loss 
of tumor suppressors, the hypoxic microenvironment, mito￾chondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation and the tissue of origin.
Cancers are extremely heterogeneous diseases and each 
cancer has its individual metabolic features. Even in a single 
cancer, its constituent cells are also heterogeneous and meta￾bolic phenotypes vary from one cell to another. Although 
aerobic glycolysis is often found in malignant tumors, 
OXPHOS still contributes to energy production in cancers, 
and may play a major role in energy production in some 
cancers (8). This article reviews the roles of glycolysis and 
OXPHOS in the energy metabolism of cancers.
2. Relationships between glycolysis and OXPHOS are 
cooperative and competitive
Before the introduction of free oxygen into the atmosphere, 
organisms on earth rely on glycolysis as an energy source. 
However, with the increase of atmospheric oxygen, cells begin 
to rely primarily on OXPHOS to produce energy since it gener￾ates more ATP per metabolite than the glycolytic pathway.
However, glycolysis, an ancient energy production pathway 
preserved in evolution, still affects energy metabolism in 
certain human organs and tissues, such as the brain, liver and 
muscle (9,10), and is also a major energy production pathway 
in anaerobic bacteria. In fact, glycolysis and OXPHOS are 
tightly coupled and serve as a molecular interconversion 
system. The process of glycolysis is carried out in the cyto￾plasm and only produces two ATPs. Pyruvate, the end product 
of glycolysis, is a fuel for OXPHOS. Under aerobic conditions 
pyruvate enters the mitochondria to be oxidized to acetyl CoA 
which combines with oxaloacetate to start the tricarboxylic

acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS, which can produce 36 ATPs. 
Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by 
lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH‑A) in the cytoplasm and then 
lactate is excreted into the extracellular space through mono￾carboxylate transporters (MCTs).
Since energy production is a response to energy demand in 
the cell, the ATP yield varies depending on cellular conditions 
and the microenvironment. Mammalian cells rely primarily 
on both glycolysis and OXPHOS to produce ATP at present. 
However, the contribution ratio of glycolysis versus OXPHOS 
for the total ATP yield varies in different cells, growth states 
and microenvironments. In normal conditions, the cell metabo￾lism consumes energy, of which 70% is supplied by OXPHOS. 
In hypoxia, however, glycolysis becomes enhanced to compen￾sate for the weakened function of OXPHOS. Therefore, 
glycolysis and OXPHOS cooperate to maintain the cellular 
energetic balance. Supposing the total ATP is a constant, if the 
function of OXPHOS is weakened, the function of glycolysis 
must be enhanced in order to maintain a balance of energy. In 
contrast, if the function of OXPHOS is normal, it will regulate 
glycolytic activity via different pathways to maintain a balance 
of energy (11). In contrast to normal cells, most cancer cells 
use glycolysis as a means of energy production whenever 
normoxia or hypoxia occurs, which is referred to as aerobic 
glycolysis (1).
3. Cancer cells have a diversity of energy production 
pathways
Cancer cells are different from most normal tissues in the 
energy metabolism and they take up glucose and glutamine 
at a high rate for aerobic glycolysis. In addition, cancers 
are extremely heterogeneous and each cancer is different in 
tissue origin and metabolic phenotype (3). Even in a single 
cancer, its constituent cells vary in metabolic phenotype (12). 
It is worth mentioning that metabolic phenotypes in cancer 
are plastic, and cancer tissues exhibit greater plasticity than 
normal tissues (13). Cancer cells may change their metabolic 
phenotypes to adapt to microenvironmental changes and the 
results of these changes give a selective advantage to cancer 
cells under the unfavorable environment (14,15).
Glycolysis versus OXPHOS. Due to their different origin and 
differentiation, not all cancers rely primarily on glycolysis, 
which contributes to total ATP at a rate of 1‑64% in cancer 
cells (8). For example, Suganuma et al examined the energy 
metabolism of four leukemia cell lines using glycolysis 
inhibitor 2‑deoxy‑D‑glucose (2‑DG) and OXPHOS inhibitor 
oligomycin (16). They found that NB4 cells were more sensi￾tive to 2‑DG than the three other cell lines, hence they regarded 
NB4 as a ‘glycolytic’ leukemia cell line. Alternatively, THP‑1 
cells were resistant to 2‑DG and sensitive to oligomycin, and 
were regarded as an ‘OXPHOS’ leukemia cell line (16). These 
results suggest that energy metabolic pathways are different 
in various cancers. We should first examine energy metabolic 
pathways in cancer cells when considering energy metabolism 
as a target for cancer therapy in order to obtain good thera￾peutic results.
Warburg considered that aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells 
was irreversibly impaired in its mitochondrial function. This 
view is challenged by recent investigations which found that 
the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS in many cancers is 
intact (1,3‑7). Certain authors consider that the Warburg effect 
in cancer is due to enhanced glycolysis suppressing OXPHOS 
rather than defects in mitochondrial OXPHOS. If glycolysis 
is inhibited in cancer cells, the function of mitochondrial 
OXPHOS can be restored (4,17‑19). For example, Fantin et al
observed that when LDH‑A was suppressed in cancer cells, 
OXPHOS function could be enhanced to compensate for 
reduced ATP by inhibited glycolysis. This observation 
suggests that most cancer cells reserve the capacity to produce 
ATP by OXPHOS. The glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells 
is due to OXPHOS being suppressed by active glycolysis 
rather than defects in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, 
they also found that proliferation and tumorigenicity of cancer 
cells were inhibited when LDH‑A activity was suppressed, 
suggesting that enhanced OXPHOS is still not sufficient to 
meet the requirement of cancer growth and that LDH‑A is a 
target of cancer therapy (4). 
Since the glycolytic contribution to total ATP production 
does not generally exceed 50‑60% (8), OXPHOS still substan￾tially contributes to ATP production in tumor cells. Although 
four human malignant tumor cell lines (HL60, HeLa, 143B 
and U937) are cells which rely on OXPHOS to support the 
growth of cells (20), this phenotype is altered under hypoxia. 
For example, the OXPHOS contribution to total ATP produc￾tion is normally 79 and 91% in cervical carcinoma HeLa 
cells and breast carcinoma MCF cells, respectively. This 
contribution, however, is reduced to 29 and 36% in hypoxia, 
respectively (21), suggesting that the glycolytic phenotype 
in cancer cells is primarily caused by hypoxia. In their 
retrospective review, Moreno‑Sánchez et al point out that 
although glycolysis plays an important role in cancer energy 
metabolism, a considerable amount of cancers use OXPHOS 
as a pathway of energy production or a mixture of glycolysis 
and OXPHOS (17). In some cases, the function of OXPHOS in 
cancer cells is even higher than in adjacent stromal cells (22). 
Researchers from Singapore recently isolated intact mito￾chondria from human ovarian and peritoneal cancer tissues, 
which exhibited the specific activities of succinate, malate and 
glutamine dehydrogenases, and had the capacity of OXPHOS. 
The cells produced ATP, but in lower amounts than the human 
skeletal muscle (6).
Smolkova et al (19) proposed four waves of metabolic 
regulation during carcinogenesis. Wave 1: cancer stem cell 
(CSC) transformation, primarily due to oncogene‑mediated 
signaling; Wave 2: hypoxia, inducing hypoxia-inducible factor 
(HIF), AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF‑κB 
signaling. In waves 1 and 2, the cell metabolism highly favors 
glycolysis and inhibits OXPHOS due to the oncogenic and 
hypoxic controls of gene reprogramming, i.e., the classic 
Warburg phenotype. Wave 3: aglycemia, nutrient shortage due 
to the high proliferation rate during malignancy. In this wave, 
the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS is partially restored 
due to gene reprogramming via the LKB1‑AMPK‑p53 
pathway and/or the PI3K‑Akt‑mTOR pathway. Myc‑mediated 
glutaminolysis is also involved in this process. Wave 4: 
mitochondria revival, retrograde signaling from revitalized 
mitochondria may constitute this wave of gene reprogram￾ming. This working hypothesis indicates that the Warburg 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 4: 1151-1157, 2012 1153
phenotype is not exclusive and that a decrease of mitochon￾drial function is not a general feature of cancer cells.
An emerging hypothesis of the so-called reverse Warburg 
effect also supports the function of OXPHOS in cancer 
cells (22). In the reverse Warburg effect, epithelial cancer cells 
induce aerobic glycolysis in carcinoma‑associated fibroblasts 
(CAFs) which produce lactate, ketones and pyruvate that 
enter the TCA cycle in cancer cells for OXPHOS (22,23). 
Previously, it was consdiered that the behavior of cancer was 
determined by cancer cells, but more recently stromal cells 
have also been demonstrated to be involved in the growth of 
cancer cells. This is possible due to the co‑evolution between 
cancer cells and stromal cells in tumorigenesis. For example, 
under the ‘education’ of cancer cells and inflammatory cyto￾kines, stromal fibroblasts become CAFs, macrophages become 
tumor‑associated macrophages (TAMs) and neutrophils 
become tumor‑associated neutrophils (TANs), and so on. In 
fact, these tumor-associated stromal cells are already different 
from their original cells and have genetic and epigenetic 
changes which lead to alterations in expression and metabolic 
profiles. Therefore, tumor cells and stromal cells not only 
influence each other in cytokines and growth factors, but 
also in energy metabolites. The relationship between cancer 
cells and tumor-associated stromal cells is to promote each 
other, unlike the original inhibitory relationship between 
normal epithelial and stromal cells (24). These studies suggest 
that caution should be applied when using lactate in cancer 
patients, and also provide a theoretical basis for using stromal 
cells as a target of cancer therapy.
An increasing number of recent studies show that lactate 
released by glycolysis in hypoxic tumor cells and/or stromal 
cells is not discharged as a waste product, but can be taken up 
by oxygenated tumor cells as energy fuel. Lactate is converted 
to pyruvate by LDH‑B and then enters the mitochondria for 
OXPHOS to generate ATP (3,14,22,25‑28). Metabolic symbi￾osis is not cancer-specific. In fact, the cooperation between 
different cells in energy production is also observed in normal 
tissues. For example, neurons rely on OXPHOS to meet their 
energy demands, whereas astrocytes rely on glycolysis to meet 
their energy needs. Lactate released by astrocytes can be taken 
up by neurons, used as energy fuel and form the so‑called 
astrocyte‑neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) (29).
Cancer cells prefer to use aerobic glycolysis for ATP 
production while still retaining the function of OXPHOS 
for the following reasons: ⅰ) Glycolysis is more suitable for 
cancer growth. Since proliferation of cancer tissues is faster 
than normal tissues, it not only needs energy, but also needs 
metabolic intermediates for the biosynthesis of macromol￾ecules. Many intermediates from glycolysis and the truncated 
TCA cycle can be used to synthesize macromolecules, such 
as nucleic acids, lipids and proteins, which are required for 
cancer growth and proliferation (2,30). ⅱ) Too efficient prod￾ucts of ATP may not a good thing for cancer cells. If cancer 
cells use high-efficiency glucose, ADP is converted to ATP. 
The high concentration of ATP will inhibit phosphofructo￾kinase 1 (PFK1), the rate‑limiting enzyme in glycolysis and 
pyruvate kinase 1 (PK1), and glycolysis will be inhibited. 
Inhibited glycolysis is unfavorable for cancer cell growth. 
Although glycolysis yields less ATP than OXPHOS, the speed 
of ATP generation in the former is quicker than in the latter, 
which is suited to the energy demands of rapid proliferation 
tissues such as cancer and embryonic tissues (11). Generally 
speaking, rapid proliferation tissues rely more on glycolysis for 
ATP production whereas differentiation tissues rely primarily 
on OXPHOS for energy production (13,31). If using glycolysis 
inhibitor 3‑bromopyruvate (3‑BP) treats tumors, it is more effi￾cient for rapid growth of tumors than slow growth of tumors. 
ⅲ) Hypoxia is often observed in cancer tissues, and glycolysis 
offers growth advantage of cancers under this hypoxic envi￾ronment (4). Glycolysis produces lactate which is released into 
the extracellular space. An acidic microenvironment provides 
a growth advantage to cancer tissues over normal tissues and 
enhances the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (32,33). In 
addition, lactic acidosis inhibits glycolysis and favors aerobic 
respiration as a means of energy generation (14). ⅳ) Due to 
the decrease of mitochondrial OXPHOS, less reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) are generated, which are cytotoxic to cancer 
cells (34,35).
Although cancer cells may retain OXPHOS function, it 
does not mean that cancer cells have no defects in mitochon￾drial respiration. Enhanced glycolysis in certain cancers is due 
to an impairment of mitochondrial function (36,37), including 
decreased expression of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes and 
transporters, truncated TCA cycle, a lowering in the amount 
of mitochondria per cell and defective respiratory chain, an 
increased amount in the natural inhibitors of the mitochondrial 
ATP synthase and a higher sensitivity of mtDNA to oxidative 
stress (17,38).
Certain cancer cells may use glutamine as energy fuel. 
Although it is widely accepted that glucose is the domi￾nant energy fuel for most cancers, it is not the only one. 
Glutaminolysis may be an alternative pathway for energy 
production in certain cancers since it is known that eleva￾tion in glutamine consumption is frequently observed in 
cancer (39,40). In 1979, Reitzer et al reported that glutamine, 
not sugar, was the major energy source for cultured HeLa 
cells (41). Since then, several reports have shown that gluta￾mine may be used as the energy fuel for cancer cells (42‑45). 
In contrast to glucose, glutamine as an energy fuel is only 
observed in a few cancer cell lines (27) and plays an important 
role in compensating for the shortage of glucose in some cases. 
After entering cells via membrane transport ASCT2, gluta￾mine is hydrolyzed to glutamate and ammonia by glutaminase 
(GLS). Glutamate combines with cysteine and glycine to form 
reduced glutathione (GSH) which is found in all human cells. 
GSH is involved in regulating the redox state and is a major 
antioxidant in cells.
Glutamate may also be converted into α‑ketoglutarate 
(α‑KG) and enters the TCA cycle to supply intermediates and 
energy for cell growth. It is particularly useful in the truncated 
TCA cycle which cannot efficiently use glucose to generate 
energy (2). This process provides fuel for the passive TCA 
cycle due to a lack of isocitrate (2,7,39,46-48). Therefore, it 
also demonstrates that cancer cells are able to use OXPHOS 
for ATP production.
Glutamine not only supplies energy in certain cancer cells, 
but also provides precursors (such as citrate) for the synthesis 
of lipids. For example, Mullen et al recently showed that 
tumor cells with mutations in complex I or III of the electron 

1154 ZHENG: ENERGY METABOLISM OF CANCER: GLYCOLYSIS VERSUS OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION
transport chain (ETC) used glutamine‑dependent reductive 
carboxylation as the major pathway of citrate formation, 
suggesting that glutamine supports tumor growth in various 
pathways in defective mitochondria (49).
It is worth mentioning that elevation of glutamine 
consumption in cancer cells is closely related to Myc activa￾tion (see below). When mouse embryonic fibroblasts are 
introduced by the Myc gene, the transfected cells will increase 
glutaminolysis. If RNA interference (RNAi) downregulates 
Myc expression, the tumor cells will reduce their dependency 
on glutamine (39). Other research also supports the effects 
of Myc on glutaminolysis. For example, human fibroblasts in 
medium without glucose will die. This process is not related to 
Myc activity and occurs by a mechanism other than apoptosis. 
However, these cells in medium without glutamine induced 
Myc-dependent apoptosis (43), suggesting that interfering 
with glutaminolysis may obtain better therapeutic effects than 
interfering with glucose in certain cancers. In fact, the situa￾tion is more complex in vivo. Cells also obtain energy through 
other pathways, such as fatty acid, lactate and ketone oxida￾tion, as well as unidentified sources (22,23,42,50).
4. Alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive 
cancer cells to aerobic glycolysis
Cancer cells still use aerobic glycolysis, despite it being an 
inefficient way to generate ATP. Increasing evidence shows 
that the alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in 
tumorigenesis play a key role in aerobic glycolysis of cancer 
(Fig. 1) (51‑53).
Oncogene Ras mutations are often found in many types of 
human cancers and drive the metabolic phenotype of cancer 
cells toward aerobic glycolysis (54). Ras activates the mamma￾lian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via the PI3K‑Akt‑mTOR 
signaling pathway and mTOR promotes glycolysis through 
inducing HIFs (34,55‑58). HIFs, induced transcription factors 
to facilitate cellular adaptation to hypoxic environments, play 
critical roles in shifting from the OXPHOS to the glycolytic 
phenotype in cancer (Fig. 1) (34,55,59,60). HIFs are heterodi￾mers consisting of an oxygen‑labile α subunit and a stable 
β subunit. In mammals, HIFs have three isoforms: HIF1, 
HIF2 and HIF3. HIF1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cells, 
whereas HIF2 and HIF3 are selectively expressed in certain 
tissues (61). As a transcription factor, HIF1 regulates over one 
hundred different genes, including vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c‑Met), 
erythropoietin (epo), transforming growth factor‑α (TGF‑α), 
platelet‑derived growth factor‑β (PDGF‑β) and glucose 
transporter GLUT1, and influences many cellular activities, 
including angiogenesis, glycolysis and cell survival.
In energy metabolism, HIF1 induces GLUT1 and GLUT3 
expression and upregulates 9 of the 10 enzymes that function 
in glycolysis (52). It also inhibits the conversion of pyruvate 
to acetyl‑CoA via the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase 
kinase 1 (PDK1), leading to a decrease of mitochondrial 
OXPHOS.
Recent studies show that mTOR upregulation of pyruvate 
kinase M2 (PKM2) is critical for aerobic glycolysis and tumor 
growth (62). M type pyruvate kinase (PK) has two isoforms: 
PKM1 and PKM2. PKM1 is expressed in most adult tissue, 
whereas PKM2 is only expressed in embryonic and prolifer￾ating tissues. When cells are transformed, PKM1 expression 
is inhibited, and PKM2 expression is restored. The metabolic 
switch from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis in tumor tissues 
is considered to be a shift from PKM1 to PKM2 expres￾sion (63). mTOR upregulates PKM2 via HIF1 and Myc (62), 
being consistent with Myc upregulation of glycolysis. Myc 
can also upregulate the PKM2 expression via polypyrimidine 
tract‑binding protein (PTB), heterogeneous nuclear ribonu￾cleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and hnRNPA2 (64). Notably, new 
data also show that PKM2 may be a strong partner for HIF1 
transcription activity in hypoxia, and since PKM2 gene tran￾scription is also activated by HIF1, this suggests that PKM2 
participates in a positive feedback loop of HIF1 transcription 
in cancer cells (65). However, another recent study showed no 
evidence of a shift from PKM1 to PKM2 expression during 
tumorigenesis. Researchers found that PKM2 was the promi￾nent isoform in all analyzed cancer samples and cell lines 
but PKM2 was also found in matched control tissues (66). 
Therefore, whether a shift from PKM1 to PKM2 expression 
occurs during tumorigenesis remains to be clarified.
In addition to mediating HIFs, mTOR directly upregulates 
the basic glycolytic processes, from glucose uptake to lactate 
formation (56,58,67). When glucose uptake goes beyond that 
required by cancer cells, it results in pyruvate being reduced to 
lactate which is excreted into the extracellular space.
The oncogene Myc, frequently overexpressed in human 
cancers, is a master transcription factor which regulates 
over 15% of human genes, including cell cycle, metabolism 
(glucose, glutamine, protein and lipid), ribosome biogenesis, 
RNA (miRNA, tRNA and rRNA), mitochondrial biogen￾esis, apoptosis and transformation. Myc stimulates the 
Warburg effect in cancers in two aspects (46,48). Firstly, 
Myc upregulates the expression of glucose transporter 
GLUT and LDH‑A (1); and secondly, Myc promotes 
glutamine metabolism, including glutamine uptake and 
Figure 1. Alterations of oncogene and tumor suppressor and hypoxia drive 
cancer cells to aerobic glycolysis. The raised levels of HIF1 and c‑Myc, and 
inactivation of p53 are very common in human cancers. HIF1, c‑Myc and p53 
form the ‘triad’ of transcription factors responsible for the glycolytic phe￾notype in cancer. HIF1α is induced by hypoxia or activated oncogenes (e.g. 
Ras, PI3K‑Akt and Her) or inactivated tumor suppressors (e.g. p53, pVHL 
and PTEN) under normoxic conditions. In addition, HIF1 also enhances Myc
expression. HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor.

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 4: 1151-1157, 2012 1155
glutaminolysis to provide energy for use by cells (39). The 
upregulation of the glutamine metabolism by c-Myc is related 
to microRNA‑23a/b (miR‑23a/b), which targets GLS. c‑Myc 
stimulates the glutamine metabolism and cell proliferation 
by repressing miR‑23a/b (68).
Compared with Ras, which regulates glycolysis via the 
PI3K‑Akt pathway, increase of the glutamine metabolism by 
Myc does not depend on the PI3K‑Akt pathway. Using the 
PI3K‑Akt pathway inhibitors suppressed the glucose metabo￾lism, but not the glutamine metabolism, suggesting that the 
oncogenes Ras and Myc cooperatively maintain transforming 
cells via the two key nutrients glucose and glutamine, 
complementing each other (39). In order to engage in replica￾tive division, a cell must duplicate its genome, proteins and 
lipids and assemble the components into daughter cells; in 
short, it becomes a factory for macromolecular biosynthesis. 
These activities require that cells take up extracellular 
nutrients such as glucose and glutamine and allocate them 
into metabolic pathways that convert them into biosynthetic 
precursors. Many intermediates from glycolysis, truncated 
TCA and glutaminolysis are used in cell biosynthesis during 
the cancer cell metabolic switch to glycolysis by Ras and 
Myc (40,57).
In addition, HIF1 also binds to a DNA motif in the promoter 
of Myc and enhances the transcription of Myc (Fig. 1). HIF1 
cooperates with c‑Myc to promote aerobic glycolysis by induc￾tion of hexokinase 2 (HK2), converting glucose to glucose 
6‑phosphate, and PDK1, a negative regulator of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase (PDH) (69).
Tumor suppressor p53, one of the most common gene 
mutations in human cancers, is a transcription factor and 
widely regulates diverse biological functions, including the 
cellular energy metabolism. It plays a pivotal role in balancing 
between glycolysis and OXPHOS (70,71). p53 combined with 
HIF1 and c‑Myc has been described as the ‘triad’ of transcrip￾tion factors responsible for the glycolytic phenotype in cancer 
(Fig. 1) (1,69,72).
In normal conditions, p53 downregulates the expression of 
GLUT1, GLUT4 and HK2, and upregulates the expression of 
TP53‑induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and 
synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) (Fig. 2) and apop￾tosis-inducing factor (AIF) (73). Thus, the basic effects of p53 
on the cellular energy metabolism are to inhibit glycolysis and 
promote OXPHOS (70,73). TIGAR, an enzyme that decreases 
the levels of fructose‑2, 6‑bisphosphate (Fru‑2, 6‑P2) by 
dephosphorylating, inhibits glycolytic activity (74). Fru‑2, 6‑P2
is an important allosteric effector (+) of PFK1, one of key 
regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (Fig. 2). SCO2 facilitates the 
assembly of cytochrome c oxidase complex in the mitochon￾drial ETC complex IV. AIF is essential for ETC complex I 
function (75). p53 deficiency leads to reduced SCO2 and AIF 
activity, resulting in mitochondrial OXPHOS impairment (76).
Moreover, p53 is also a potent negative regulator of HIF1α
(Fig. 1). Activation of p53 blocks the accumulation of HIF1α
in normoxia and hypoxia (77), and inhibits HIF1 by inducing 
microRNA‑107 (78).
The p53‑deficient cells produced significantly higher levels 
of lactate, indicating a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis in 
energy production. For example, glycolysis contributing to the 
total amount of ATP is 40% in human colon cancer cell line 
HCT116 with wild‑type (+/+) p53, rising to 66% in homozy￾gous (‑/‑) p53 (71). Inactivation of p53 leads to favor aerobic 
glycolysis is in many aspects, including increase of glucose 
uptake and HIF‑1α, and decrease of TIGAR, SCO2 and AIF
expression. Moreover, mutant p53 also increases the activity 
of two other glycolytic enzymes, HK2 and phosphoglycerate 
mutase (PGM), catalyzing 3‑phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 
2‑phosphoglycerate (2PG) (71,73,79).
5. Conclusion
Cancers have different metabolic phenotypes of energy for 
several reasons. First, cancers are heterogeneous diseases and 
their genetic heterogeneity determines metabolic heteroge￾Figure 2. p53 modulates cell energy metabolism. p53 represses the expression of glucose transporter genes (e.g., GLUT1 and GLUT4) and increases the levels 
of TIGAR, an inhibitor of glycolysis, in the cytoplasm. In addition, p53 increases the levels of SCO2 in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, consequently 
promoting mitochondrial respiration. TIGAR, TP53‑induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator; SCO2, synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2.

neity (15). Even from a single cancer, its constituent cells are 
also heterogeneous and reflect differences in metabolic pheno￾type from one cell to another. The different subclones within a 
cancer benefit each other in the metabolism and form a meta￾bolic symbiont (26). This phenomenon is not cancer-specific, 
and cancer cells also use other physiological mechanisms to 
support their rapid growth. Second, cancer cells continuously 
reprogram to adapt to environmental pressures and alteration of 
growth conditions. The result is that the ratio between glycolysis 
and OXPHOS to yield total ATP, the ratio between glucose and 
glutamine to yield total ATP, or the ratio between glucose/gluta￾mine and fatty acid to yield total ATP, are continuously changing. 
The result of these changes is that the unfavorable environment 
provides a selective advantage to cancer cells.
