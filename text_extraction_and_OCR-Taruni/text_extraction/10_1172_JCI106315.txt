From The Rockefeller University, New York 10021
A B S T R A C T The metabolism of P-sitosterol was com￾pared to that of cholesterol in 12 patients. Sterol bal￾ance methods were supplemented by radiosterol studies,
with the following results. (a) Plasma concentrations
of P-sitosterol ranged from 0.30 to 1.02 mg/100 ml
plasma in patients on intakes of 6-sitosterol typical of
the American diet. Plasma levels were raised little
when intakes were increased greatly, and on fixed in￾takes they were constant from week to week. On diets
devoid of plant sterols, the plasma and feces rapidly be￾came free of p-sitosterol. (b) The percentage of esterified
P-sitosterol in the plasma was the same as for cholesterol.
However, the rate of esterification of P-sitosterol was
slower than that for cholesterol. (c) Specific activity￾time curves after simultaneous pulse labeling with
#-sitosterol-3H and cholesterol-"C conformed to two￾pool models. The two exponential half-lives of f-sito￾sterol were much shorter than for cholesterol, and pool
sizes were much smaller. Values of turnover for
,8-sitosterol obtained by the sterol balance method agreed
closely with those derived by use of the two-pool model.
There was no endogenous synthesis of P-sitosterol in the
patients studied; hence, daily turnover of P-sitosterol
equaled its daily absorption. Absorption of P-sitosterol
was 5% (or less) of daily intake, while cholesterol ab￾sorption ranged from 45 to 54% of intake. (d) About
20% of the absorbed f-sitosterol was converted to cholic
and chenodeoxycholic acids. The remainder was ex￾creted in bile as free sterol; this excretion was more
rapid than that of cholesterol. (e) The employment of
i3-sitosterol as an internal standard to correct for losses
of cholesterol in sterol balance studies is further vali￾dated by the results presented here.
INTRODUCTION
The fastidious work of Sch6nheimer (1, 2) in the 1930's
demonstrated that little if any intestinal absorption of
plant sterols occurs in mammals. In five animal species
Schbnheimer found no increase in the total sterol con￾tent of the liver after feeding large amounts of plant

sterols and concluded that plant sterols were not ab￾sorbed to any appreciable extent. These conclusions
were sharpened in 1955 by Gould, Jones, Wissler, and
Taylor (3, 4), who addressed the question of 8-sitosterol
absorption in moribund patients and in rats with the
greater sensitivity inherent in the use of radioactive
sterols; these authors estimated the absorption of radio￾sterol at less than 5% of the dose fed. In rats Borg￾str6m (5) in 1968 verified these low levels of absorp￾tion of P-sitosterol.
However, later investigators (6-9) reached different
conclusions: they measured P-sitosterol absorption in
rats by means of various sterol balance procedures and
ascribed to absorption any difference between oral in￾take and fecal excretion. In this manner they ascertained
that up to 50% of the intake was absorbable. However,
these workers did not consider that losses of plant
sterols during intestinal transit can be due to bacterial
destruction of the sterol ring, a possibility that to us
seems highly likely (10).
Since we have claimed (10) that p-sitosterol is an
ideal internal standard to correct for degradative losses
of cholesterol in sterol balance studies, we considered it
necessary to reevaluate the question of 8-sitosterol ab￾sorption in man. We measured the absorption of P-sito￾sterol by the isotopic balance method (11 ) and by analysis
of specific activity-time curves after pulse labeling in￾travenously (12); we then compared these results
with data for cholesterol absorption obtained simultane￾ously in the same patients. Our findings agree with the
results of Gould and of Borgstr6m, namely, that less
than 5% of -dietary 1-sitosterol is absorbed. In the
course of these studies we obtained other data concern￾ing the metabolism of 3-sitosterol in man, such as the
question of its endogenous synthesis (13), its esterifica￾tion and transport in the plasma, and its transformation
into cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids.
METHODS
Patients
Studies were carried out on the metabolic ward at The
Rockefeller University Hospital; the age, sex, body build,
and clinical diagnosis of each patient are given in Table I.
Eight patients had familial hypercholesterolemia with normal
952 The Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 49 1970

plasma triglyceride concentrations (type II by the lipo￾protein phenotyping method of Fredrickson, Levy, and Lees
[15] ); three patients had elevations in both plasma cho￾lesterol and triglyceride concentrations (one type IV and
two type V); and one patient had normal concentrations of
lipoproteins.
Diets
Food intakes consisted exclusively of orally administered
liquid formula feedings in which dietary fats contributed
40%, protein 15%, and glucose 45% of total caloric intake,
or were fat free (15% protein and 85%o glucose) ; vitamin
and mineral supplements were given as described previ￾ously (16). In each case the caloric intake was adjusted
to maintain total body weight at a constant level throughout
each study.
Table II lists the dietary fats used and the sterol con￾tents of the various formulas. When the plant sterols and
cholesterol were not inherent in the dietary fats, they were
dissolved in them prior to their incorporation in the formu￾las during large scale homogenization (16). Aliquots of
each formula were repeatedly analyzed for sterol content
(17) as tests of formula homogeneity.
Experimental design
(a) Patient la. Patient 1 was studied on different diets
in two successive years. In the earlier study (la) a formula
diet containing tracer amounts of 8-sitosterol-22,23-3H was
fed five times daily for 83 days in order to attain the isotopic
steady state (18) for f-sitosterol. During this steady state,
measurements of the concentration of fi-sitosterol in the
plasma were found to be the same by two independent
methods, gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC), and isotopic
(see section Isotopes). After oral administration of labeled
jS-sitosterol was discontinued, the cumulative clearance of
#-sitosterol from the body was determined as a measure of
the amount of the sterol retained in the body.
(b) Patients lb, 2, and 3. The rates of turnover of
fi-sitosterol and cholesterol in the plasma were determined
from specific activity-time curves in patients lb, 2, and 3
after simultaneous pulse labeling with f-sitosterol-22,23-3H
and cholesterol-4-'4C by the intravenous route; calculations
of body pool sizes and intestinal absorption of cholesterol
and fi-sitosterol also were made. Conversion of 6-sitosterol
into the primary bile acids was demonstrated on samples of
bile obtained by duodenal intubation.
(c) Patients 4-8. In these five patients the effects of
moderate and high intakes of dietary #-sitosterol (desig￾nated as studies a and b, respectively) on plasma concentra￾tions of cholesterol and P-sitosterol were assessed. Mea￾surements of turnover and pool sizes of 8-sitosterol were
made in patient 4 on the two intake levels.
(d) Patients 9-12. Stools from these patients were ana￾lyzed for the presence of #-sitosterol at a time when this
sterol had been absent from the diets for at least 4 wk.
Measurements were made by gas-liquid chromatography
(GLC), utilizing the maximum sensitivity that we can
presently attain (see under Results).

§ Patient 1 was studied on two occasions in successive years. In the earlier study he was fed f3-sitosterol-22,23-3H daily during
period II; in periods I and III he was fed a butter oil formula free of ,3-sitosterol.
This butter oil was subjected to molecular distillation for removal of free cholesterol (Distillation Products Industries,
Rochester, N. Y.).
Isotopes
3-sitosterol-22,23-8H was prepared according to the method
of Steele and Mosettig (19). In this procedure the starting
material, i-stigmasterol methyl ether, was prepared by Dr.
M. J. Thompson, USDA, Beltsville, Md.; it was reduced
with tritium gas by Dr. G. Gupta of The Rockefeller Uni￾versity, and the reduction product was converted into the
acetate of 8-sistosterol-22,23-8H by Dr. Thompson. We hy￾drolyzed the sterol ester and isolated the free labeled sterol
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel G with
heptane: diethyl ether, 2: 1. The final product had a specific
activity of 400 mCi/mmole. Cholesterol-4-'4C was obtained
from New England Nuclear Corp., Boston, Mass. Both la￾beled sterols were shown to be better than 99%c pure by
TLC on Florisil (Floridin Company, Tallahassee, Fla.), in
the system diethyl ether: n-heptane, 55: 45. Measurements
of radioactivity were made in a Packard Tri-Carb Scintil￾lation Counter, model 3003, (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.,
Downers Grove, Ill.) as previously described (17).
Patient la ingested 8-sitosterol-22,23-'H (21.3 MCi, 620
mg) daily for a period of 83 days. At the time of homogeni￾zation the tracer sterol dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was
added to 40-kg batches of formula containing nonlabeled
#-sitosterol in corn oil. A constant intake of isotopically
labeled sterol was assured by feeding the same amount of
formula each day (five divided doses).
Patients lb, 2, and 3 were given a mixture of 8-sitosterol￾22,23-3H (136 ,uCi) and cholesterol-4-J4C (90 ,uCi) as a
single intravenous pulse at the beginning of their studies.
Patient 4 was given a mixture of fi-sitosterol-22,23-3H (50
,Ci) and cholesterol-4-"C (27 ,uCi) during the first study,
and 8-sitosterol-22,23-8H (110 ,uCi) and cholesterol-4-"C (90
MuCi) during the second study. In all cases the radiosterols
were dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol which was then dispersed
in 150 ml of physiologic saline; the dispersion was immedi￾ately infused by vein.
Steroid analyses
Fecal steroids.' Complete stool collections were made
throughout each study and combined into 4-day pools. Fecal
neutral and acidic steroids were isolated separately, and
their masses and specific activities were measured by meth￾ods developed in this laboratory (17, 20). These TLC and
GLC procedures permit the essential distinction to be made
between plant sterols and cholesterol, and between the two
families of bacterial conversion products derived from plant
sterols and cholesterol during intestinal transit (5#,3p-OH￾and 5,8,3-keto-compounds).
Plasma, erythrocyte, and bile steroids. For analysis of
cholesterol and f-sitosterol in plasma, erythrocytes (RBC),
and bile, it proved expedient to modify the fecal neutral
steroid procedure in several ways. Because the accuracy of
the results in this study depends upon the analysis of small
amounts of j8-sitosterol in the presence of large amounts of
cholesterol, we present this procedure in some detail.
1 ml of plasma, packed RBC, or bile was refluxed for 1
hr with 20 ml of N NaOH in 90% ethanol; after refluxing,
water (10 ml) was added to the alkaline saponification mix￾ture, and nonsaponifiable components were extracted three
times with 50-ml portions of petroleum ether, 60-80'C
(PE). The combined PE extracts were evaporated to dryness
in a round-bottom flask, and the residue was redissolved in
1 The term steroid is used in preference to sterol because
significant amounts of ketonic metabolites of cholesterol and
of the plant sterols are usually present in the neutral and
acidic fractions of the fecal lipids.

5.00 ml of ethyl acetate containing 350 Ag of 5a-cholestane.
4 ml of this solution was utilized for radioactivity counting.
The remaining 1 ml was taken for sterol analysis by GLC;
solvent was evaporated and the trimethylsilyl (TMS)
ethers of the sterols were formed by addition of 50 gl of
TMS reaction mixture (Sil Prep, Applied Science Labora￾tories, State College, Pa.). Generally, about 3 pl of this
mixture was analyzed by GLC; this was equivalent to about
1% (1/5 X 3/50) of the neutral sterols in the original 1 ml
sample of plasma, packed RBC, or bile.
Much greater sensitivity was required for analyses of
materials obtained from patients fed diets free of p-sitosterol.
In these cases the neutral sterol fraction was extracted as
described above from 1 ml of plasma or fecal homogenate
and dissolved in 1.00 ml ethyl acetate containing 70 ,ug of 5a￾cholestane. This in turn was concentrated in the tip of a
small conical tube during the evaporation of solvent; TMS
ethers were formed by addition of 5 IAI of TMS reaction mix￾ture. As much of this mixture as possible was then injected
into the GLC column, and the analysis of the 8-sitosterol
derivative was accomplished at the maximum instrument
sensitivity consistent with acceptable base line noise. Under
our conditions a peak for TMS-B-sitosterol 2 X base line
noise was equivalent to no more than 65 ng per ml of plasma
or per g of fecal homogenate.
Quantitative analysis of TMS ethers of cholesterol and
fi-sitosterol was carried out by GLC on 4-ft columns packed
with 1% DC-560 (Applied Science Laboratories) at a col￾umn temperature of 240'C with a flame ionization detector,
F and M Biomedical Gas Chromatograph, Model 400
(F and M Scientific Corp., Avondale, Pa.); these columns
had 2000-3000 theoretical plates for TMS-cholesterol. In￾dividual peak areas were measured by electronic integration,
Model CRS-100, (Infotronics, Inc., Houston, Tex.). Be￾cause of the large excess of cholesterol relative to 8-sito￾sterol in all samples, the sensitivity of the GLC detector was
usually increased 32-fold after emergence of the cholesterol
peak. The two sterols were individually quantified by relating
their peak areas to that of the internal recovery standard,
5a-cholestane; correction factors are not required (17).
In tests with standard mixtures of these two sterols, we
found we could reliably measure 65 ng of 8-sitosterol per
ml of plasma or per g of fecal homogenate, in the presence of
large excesses of cholesterol.
In the analysis of bile, neutral sterols were removed by
extraction with PE, and the unconjugated bile acids were
isolated from the aqueous alcohol phase after alkaline hy￾drolysis of the conjugated acids according to our method for
isolation of fecal acidic steroids (20). The methyl esters of
the trihydroxy- and dihydroxycholanic acids were isolated
by TLC on Silica Gel H in the system chloroform: acetone:
methanol, 70: 25: 5, and the specific activity of each bile
acid class was measured. For quantification of bile acids
by GLC, 6-ft columns containing 1% HiEff 8BP (Applied
Science Laboratories) were used at 2300C; they offered
about 3000 theoretical plates for TMS chenodeoxycholic
methyl ester, with a separation factor of 1.10 between this
derivative and that of deoxycholic acid.
Free and esterified sterols in plasma. The lipids in 2 ml
of plasma were extracted into 38 ml of chloroform: methanol,
2: 1. During evaporation of solvent small quantities of ethanol
were added to facilitate the removal of water; the residue
was redissolved in exactly 15.00 ml of ethyl acetate. 10.00
ml was taken for TLC on 0.5 mm Silica Gel H plates; the
developing system contained petroleum ether: ethyl ether:
acetic acid, 85: 15: 0.5, in which free sterols have an Rf of
0.30 and esterified sterols 0.90. The free and esterified sterols
were collected separately according to the method of Gold￾rick and Hirsch (21), and measurement of sterol content was
made by GLC after saponification and TMS-ether forma￾tion, as described earlier in this paper.
Calculations
Corrections for neutral steroid losses. Corrections for
losses of neutral steroids during intestinal transit and for
variations in fecal flow rates were made with nonlabeled
dietary plant sterols as internal standard (10).
Cholesterol absorption. The absorption of dietary cho￾lesterol was measured as the difference between dietary in￾take and unabsorbed dietary neutral steroids in feces. The
latter quantity was obtained by the procedure designated as
Method I in this laboratory (22): unabsorbed dietary neu￾tral steroids equal total fecal neutral steroids (determined
by chromatographic methods) minus fecal neutral steroids
of endogenous origin (determined by the isotopic balance
technique after intravenous pulse labeling with radio￾active cholesterol).
RESULTS
P-Sitosterol in feces of patients fed diets free of
P-sitosterol. If P-sitosterol is synthesized by the body,
it should be excreted in the feces continuously; the mag￾nitude of this endogenous synthesis will be most clearly
defined when the diet is free of plant sterols. With these
considerations in mind we attempted to measure P-sito￾sterol in the feces of patients 9-12 who had been fed
formula diets free of this sterol for periods longer than
4 wk. Diets and feces were analyzed, and no 9-sitosterol
or its bacterial transformation products could be detected.
Since 65 ng of P-sitosterol per ml of plasma or per g
of fecal homogenate can be reliably measured by our
GLC techniques, we can conclude that excretion of
P-sitosterol in patients 9-12 was less than 10 /g/day
(the daily weight of feces of these patients ranged from
70 to 150 g). Thus, it appears improbable that these
patients synthesized more than 10 lyg of P-sitosterol per
day.
Measurement of cholesterol and P-sitosterol concentra￾tions in plasma and RBC. Table III presents the re￾sults obtained for plasma and RBC levels of cholesterol
and P-sitosterol in patients lb, 2, and 3 who were fed
diets in which the amounts of cholesterol and P-sitosterol
approximated those of the average American diet. Mea￾surements of plasma cholesterol and P-sitosterol concen￾trations were made twice weekly for 9 wk, as well as
measurements of levels of RBC sterols. The average
concentrations of plasma cholesterol ranged from 226
to 300 mg/100 ml, and of plasma P-sitosterol from 0.30
to 1.02; thus, the ratios of cholesterol to P-sitosterol in
plasma ranged from about 300-800 to 1. The relatively
small standard deviations of the means for plasma con￾centrations of cholesterol and P-sitosterol indicate a high
degree of constancy of plasma levels of these two sterols
throughout each study. RBC concentrations of cho￾lesterol varied from 105 to 131 mg/100 ml of packed

cells, and p-sitosterol concentrations from 0.17 to 0.40
mg/100 ml of packed cells. The cholesterol to P-sitosterol
ratios in RBC were nearly the same as those in plasma,
suggesting a free exchange of both sterols between
plasma and RBC.
In five patients (patients 4-8) who received P-sito￾sterol at two levels of intake, concentrations of p-sitosterol
in plasma were consistently higher during the period
of the higher intake; but, despite eightfold or greater in￾creases in intakes of 8-sitosterol, plasma concentrations
increased less than twofold. The increase in plasma
9-sitosterol during the greater intake was associated
with a similar increase in RBC f8-sitosterol (patient 4b),
and again the ratio of cholesterol to 8-sitosterol in RBC
was the same as that of plasma.
A comparison of the degree of esterification of 8-sito￾sterol with that of cholesterol is presented in Table IV.
Three patients (lb, 2, and 3) were pulse labeled simul￾taneously by the intravenous route with 8-sitosterol-'H
and cholesterolW4C, and the distribution of labeled sterols
in the free and esterified sterol fractions of plasma was
analyzed 30-39 days after administration of isotopes;
labeled 9-sitosterol was found to be esterified to the same
extent as labeled cholesterol (60-75% esterified). In
patient 4, measurements of the free and ester ratios of
the two radiosterols were begun earlier. Differences in
esterification rate were most noticeable during the 1st
few days; in this patient P-sitosterol appeared to be
esterified at a slower rate than cholesterol.
The attainment of the isotopic steady state for f-sito￾sterol. In another experiment designed to examine
whether 6-sitosterol was synthesized endogenously, pa￾tient la received a diet free of 9-sitosterol (40% butter
oil) for 40 days in period I. After 1 wk and through￾out the remaining 5 wk on the P-sitosterol-free formula,
we found less than 65 ng of f-sitosterol per ml of plasma
or per g of feces.
In period 11 (83 days) the patient was given a formula
diet containing 40% of calories as corn oil in which
9-sitosterol-22,23-5H had been incorporated during its
manufacture; each day the patient ingested 620 mg of
13-sitosterol of specific activity 74,245 dpm/mg. On the
956 G. Salen, E. H. Ahrens, Jr., and S. M. Grundy

2nd day of this regimen radioactivity was detected in
the plasma; it rose to reach a constant level of approxi￾mately 1000 dpm/ml plasma in about 2 wk (Fig. 1).
The plateau in plasma radioactivity persisted for the
remainder of period II, suggesting the attainment of the
isotopic steady state (18).
During this period when plasma levels of radioactivity
were constant, the average specific activity of plasma
8-sitosterol (calculated from plasma radioactivity and
mass measurement of P-sitosterol by GLC) was 76,149
dpm/mg for the last four determinations (Table V).
This agrees within 3% with that of the diet (74,245
dpm/mg). The near identity of specific activities of
plasma and dietary 8-sitosterol is added evidence that
this patient did not synthesize 8-sitosterol; if synthesis
had occurred, the specific activity of plasma 9-sitosterol
wodld have been less than that of the diet, because of
dilution of radioactive f3-sitosterol in the plasma with
that newly synthesized. Furthermore, during the same
16 day period, measurements of the specific activity of
the fecal neutral steroids derived from f-sitosterol
agreed with those of plasma and dietary P-sitosterol
specific activities within +5% (77,840 dpm/mg +1743:
mean +SD in five successive 4-day stool collections).
These findings, especially when coupled with the ab￾sence of P-sitosterol in plasma and feces during the
P-sitosterol-free diet of periods I and III, are taken to

fed; the plant sterol was not detectable in plasma or feces
after 3 wk. During period II a corn oil formula that fur￾nished 620 mg/day of fi-sitosterol-3H was fed; the isotopic
steady state was attained in about 30 days. When the intake
of p-sitosterol was discontinued (period III), the radio￾activity in the plasma rapidly declined, and in 4 wk un￾labeled P-sitosterol was no longer detectable in plasma and
feces. In period III, 226 mg of fi-sitosterol recovered in the
feces was demonstrated to represent the total body pool of

indicate that endogenous synthesis of P-sitosterol did not
occur.
In period III i8-sitosterol feeding was abruptly dis￾continued by returning to the butter oil formula of pe￾riod I. Plasma radioactivity declined sharply from 1000
to less than 150 cpm/ml of plasma after 30 days; by
GLC the mass of B-sitosterol in plasma and feces fell
to the base line limits noted in period I (Fig. 1). In
the first 16 days of period III 369 mg of 3-sitosterol was
excreted in the feces; thereafter, our most sensitive as￾says failed to detect this sterol. We estimate that 143 mg
of 369 mg represented f-sitosterol which lagged behind
in the bowel after its feeding in period II had been dis￾continued.2 The difference (369 - 143 = 226 mg) was
2Chromic oxide (300 mg/day) had been fed as an inert
marker during period II (23). The ingestion of 6-sitosterol
and chromic oxide was discontinued simultaneously at the
end of Period II; thereafter, 69 mg of chromic oxide was
excreted in the feces in the first 4 days of period III and
none thereafter. Since 69 mg of chromic oxide is equivalent
to 23% of 1 day's intake, we have assumed that 23%o of the
last day's intake of #-sitosterol during period II was ex￾creted in the feces during the 1st days of period III; 23%
of 620 mg (1 day's intake) = 143 mg.

fluxing from the body after removal of P-sitosterol from
the diet.
The fact that no further p-sitosterol was excreted in
the feces or found in the plasma after 30 days on a
8-sitosterol-free diet is offered as evidence that the syn￾thesis of f-sitosterol in this man was not repressed by
the 3-sitosterol absorbed in period II.

Analysis of 8-sitosterol turnover by the isotopic bal￾ance method. The turnover of P-sitosterol in patients
lb, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b was measured by the isotopic balance
method after pulse labeling with P-sitosterol-22,23-2H.
This calculation was based on the assumption (proven
true in section 3) that the specific activity of the fecal
neutral steroids derived from j-sitosterol is the same as
the specific activity of plasma P-sitosterol. Thus, the
daily excretion (milligrams per day) of neutral and
acidic steroids derived from f-sitosterol can be calcu￾lated by dividing the total number of disintegrations
per minute of tritium excreted per day in each fecal
steroid fraction by the specific activity (dpm/mg) of
plasma 9-sitosterol.
The values thus obtained are shown in Table VI: 5-14
mg/day were excreted as neutral steroids and 0.08-2.31
mg/day as acidic steroids. In the metabolic steady state
the sum of the fecal neutral and acidic steroids reflects
the daily turnover of ,8-sitosterol (since all other ex￾cretion routes are trivial in man except in biliary
obstruction, in which the excretion of bile acids via
the kidney may be sizable).
The isotopic balance method also provides a mea￾sure of daily bile acid synthesis from P-sitosterol, for
in the steady state the daily excretion of fecal acidic
steroids is equivalent to their daily synthesis. Patients
lb, 2, and 3 formed 2.25, 1.45, and 2.31 mg of bile acids
from P-sitosterol each day, respectively. In contrast, this
conversion was almost immeasurable in patient 4; as
shown, this patient also converted very small amounts
of cholesterol into bile acids.

FIGURE 2 Specific activity-time curve for plasma 6-sito￾sterol after pulse labeling intravenously with 8-sitosterol-'H.
A two pool model is suggested by the curve-peeling method:
the difference values (small crosses) obtained by subtracting
the points on the extrapolated line from the experimental
points fit a straight line.
Analysis of sterol turnover and pool sizes by the two
pool model. In the four patients pulse labeled by simul￾taneous intravenous administration of f8-sitosterol-22,23-
'H and cholesterol-4-'4C, specific activities of each of the
sterols in the plasma were measured twice weekly.
Specific activity-time curves for each of the sterols in all
four patients showed two components: a rapid non￾linear decline followed by a period of more gradual, but
log linear decay (Figs. 2, 3). When these four sets of
curves were analyzed mathematically by the equations
given by Goodman and Noble (12), each curve con￾formed to that described for a two pool model. Ac￾cordingly, we have calculated values for turnover and
pool sizes for each of the sterols (Tables VII, and VIII).
The curves illustrated in Fig. 3 show that in each case
the turnover of P-sitosterol was more rapid than that
of cholesterol. This comparison is given numerically in
Tables VII and VIII: the average value for the ti of
the first exponential for cholesterol was 1.6 times longer
than that of 8-sitosterol; the ti for the second exponen￾tial was 3.5 times longer than that of 8-sitosterol. The
more rapid disappearance of labeled 8-sitosterol previ￾ously demonstrated by Gould et al. (3) can be ascribed
in part to the smaller body pool of P-sitosterol; however,
in the next section we shall present evidence that
P-sitosterol actually is excreted preferentially.
In these four patients the plasma P-sitosterol con￾centration varied from 0.3 to 1.73 mg/100 ml, a fivefold
variation. Yet, the narrow range of variation of the
two exponentials of radioactive 6-sitosterol indicates
that the kinetics of P-sitosterol turnover were very
much alike from patient to patient. Indeed, in patient 4
who was tested during periods of low and high dietary
intakes of f-sitosterol, the two sets of half-lives of
P-sitosterol were almost identical, even though the
plasma concentration of P-sitosterol had doubled.
Estimates of fi-sitosterol absorption. When the val￾ues for turnover of f-sitosterol derived by the two pool
model (Table VII) were compared with the values ob￾tained by the isotopic balance method (Table VI), close
agreement was observed. Since all available evidence
leads us to conclude that #-sitosterol was not synthesized
by our patients, it becomes clear that in the metabolic
steady state the daily turnover of P-sitosterol equals
the amount absorbed each day from dietary sources
(Fig. 4). When these four patients ingested 242 to 415
mg of P-sitosterol per day, the absorption of P-sitosterol
varied from 6.5 to 12.5 mg/day according to the two
pool model, and 5.2 to 14 mg/day according to the iso￾topic balance method; the differences are not signifi￾cantly different (Student's t test). Patient 4 absorbed
5.2-7.0 mg/day out of a daily intake of 320 mg, and
and 13.5-14.0 mg when the diet contained 1909 mg/day,
a doubling of absolute absorption with a sixfold in￾crease in intake.

FIGURE 4 General two pool model for cholesterol and j8-sitosterol in man.
Rate constants are denoted by k values (after Goodman and Noble (12]).
In the case of cholesterol, unlabeled sterol enters the body pools (A and B)
either from new synthesis (SA and SB) or by absorption from the diet. For
,8-sitosterol, however, the only source of unlabeled sterol is from the diet,
since there is no endogenous synthesis. Cholesterol and j8-sitosterol are
excreted only from pool A (ka).
The recovery of nonlabeled dietary 8-sitosterol in the
feces by the sterol balance method varied from 63 to
105% of the daily intake; we have previously proposed
that these losses must be due to degradation of the neu￾tral sterol ring structure during intestinal transit (10).
In view of the absorption data discussed in the previous
paragraph, it is clearly erroneous to ascribe losses of
i3-sitosterol of this magnitude to absorption.
Turnover of cholesterol determined by the two pool
model and by sterol balance methods. Measurements
of cholesterol turnover by kinetic analysis of the two
pool model were compared with turnover data deter￾mined by sterol balance methods (Table VIII) and found
to be similar, as described previously in 10 other pa￾tients (24).
In patient 4a who was fed a diet virtually free of cho￾lesterol and low in P-sitosterol, the half-lives of cho￾lesterol in pools A and B were longer and the total
turnover (359 mg/day) was less than in patients lb,
2, and 3, whose diets contained much more cholesterol;
thus, the increased rates of turnover in these three pa￾tients were the result of absorption of appreciable
amounts of exogenous cholesterol as well as of a greater
rate of daily synthesis. When large amounts of j8-sito￾sterol were added to the diet (patient 4 b), reabsorption
of endogenous cholesterol was reduced; as a result,
plasma concentrations of cholesterol were lowered, and
the turnover of cholesterol in pools A and B was in￾creased. Bile acid synthesis in patient 4a was consider￾ably lower than in patients fed cholesterol in their diets;
it was this patient in whom the conversion of P-sitosterol
to bile acids (Table VI) was exceptionally low.
Comparison of cholesterol and P-sitosterol absorption
during the steady state. Tables VII and VIII com￾pare the percentage absorption of cholesterol and of
P-sitosterol in patients lb, 2, and 3; their diets con￾tained sterols in amounts typical of daily intakes in the
United States. Cholesterol absorption varied from 204
to 307 mg/day (45-54% of daily intake). In contrast,
the amount of P-sitosterol absorbed was only 6.5-12.5
mg/day (1.6-5.2% of daily intake). The absorption
of f-sitosterol was apparently not affected by differing
intakes of dietary cholesterol: no appreciable difference
in 13-sitosterol absorption was noted between patients
ib, 2, and 3 (fed cholesterol-containing diets) and
patient 4a (fed a diet virtually free of cholesterol).
The likelihood of this ought to be more rigorously
tested by varying the cholesterol and ,8-sitosterol intake
in the same patient.
Calculation of pool sizes of 8-sitosterol. Table VII
displays our calculations of the pool sizes of 3-sitosterol,
using the equations of Nestel, Whyte, and Goodman
(25). The amount of 8-sitosterol in pool A was found
to vary in the four patients from 44 to 125 mg, while the
quantity in pool B ranged from 21 to 76 mg; in general,
the amount in pool B was about half that in pool A.
Thus, the total amount of P-sitosterol in the body (pools
A + B) varied from 72 to 201 mg.
Table VII shows that in patient 1 b total body #-sito￾sterol was 201 mg when the dietary intake of 3-sitosterol
was 242 mg/day; this estimate agrees well with the
calculation of total body 8-sitosterol of 226 mg made 1 yr
earlier in this patient by measuring the washout of
3-sitosterol after shifting to a #-sitosterol-free diet from
a diet containing 620 mg each day (see section 3). We
consider that the agreement in results obtained in one
patient in successive years by two different, methods
supports the premises on which both methods are
based.
In patient 4, when the daily intake of 8-sitosterol was
increased from 320 to 1909 mg, the amount of f-sitosterol
in pool A increased from 71 to 111 mg and that in pool
962 G. Salen, E. H. Ahrens, Jr., and S. M. Grundy
SA SB

B rose from 36 to 62 mg. Thus, following a sixfold
increase in dietary intake, the size of pool B was ex￾panded to a greater extent than pool A.
Consequently, the amount of 8-sitosterol retained in
the body seems to be roughly proportional to the
amount absorbed per day. Although our data are too
few to permit rigorous analysis, a plot of these data
can be extrapolated through the zero intercept; each
milligram absorbed per day is equivalent to about 15 mg
of total body 8-sitosterol (Fig. 5). We take this to be
additional evidence that endogenous synthesis of 8-sito￾sterol did not occur in these patients.
Equilibration of labeled sterols between plasma, RBC,
and bile after pulse labeling. At various intervals after
simultaneous pulse labeling with 8-sitosterol-3H and cho￾lesterol-24C, samples of duodenal contents rich in bile
were obtained in patients lb, 2, and 3 (in some cases
immediately following the injection of cholecystokinin
intravenously); blood was drawn at the same time.
Neutral sterols were isolated from plasma, RBC, and
bile, and the specific activities of 3H- and "4C-labeled
sterols were determined.
As shown in Table IX, the specific activities of the
two neutral sterols were very similar in the plasma,
RBC, and bile. While both sets of specific activities de￾cayed with fime (Fig. 3), the isotope ratio of P-sitosterol
to cholesterol decreased significantly in all cases, indi￾cating that the fractional rate of turnover of 8-sitosterol
was more rapid than that of cholesterol. Moreover, the
isotope ratios of the two neutral sterols in bile were
15 -
o 10
0
5/
E
consistently higher than those in the plasma. This
clearly indicates that the liver can differentiate between
P-sitosterol and cholesterol and that P-sitosterol is pref￾erentially secreted into the bile from sterol pools.
The incorporation of p-sitosterol-H and cholesterol-'4C
into bile acids. Table X compares the specific activity
of the tri- and dihydroxycholanic acids in bile with that
of total neutral sterols (cholesterol + P-sitosterol) in
plasma in three patients after simultaneous pulse labeling
with O-sitosterol-3H and cholesterol-"C by the intrave￾nous route. It is seen that the biliary bile acids were
labeled both with 'H and "C, indicating the simultaneous
conversion of both neutral sterols into the primary bile
acids. Moreover, the radioactivities per milligram of
bile acids for both 'H and `C were approximately the
same as those in total plasma neutral sterols, suggesting
that there was little if any enzymatic discrimination
between the two sterols in this conversion. Comparing
these results with those of section 5, it is apparent that,
while P-sitosterol is somehow selected from cholesterol
in the liver cell in the process of neutral sterol excretion,
the enzymatic conversion of the two neutral sterols
to the two primary bile acids is nonselective.
A separate communication will describe the formation
of cholic-3H, chenodeoxycholic-3H, and deoxycholic-'H
acids after pulse labeling with P-sitosterol-22,23-'H;
their isolation by countercurrent distribution and pre￾parative TLC; and their identification with pure stan￾dards by TLC, GLC, melting points, and elemental
analysis.

DISCUSSION
Daily turnover of 8-sitosterol by two methods. In
the present studies the turnover of 8-sitosterol was in￾vestigated in four patients by two independent methods.
Analysis of the decay curve of plasma specific activity
of 9-sitosterol after pulse labeling intravenously indi￾cated that the turnover of f-sitosterol conforms to a two
pool model, just as in the case of cholesterol. According
to the theory of the two pool model (12) the daily
production rate of 8-sitosterol (PRA) should equal the
amount of new 8-sitosterol which enters the more rapidly
exchangeable pool (pool A, Fig. 4) exclusive of recircu￾lated sterol. In five studies of four patients the rate of
turnover calculated in this manner varied from 6 to 14
mg/day. In the same patients turnover data were ob￾tained independently by application of the isotopic bal￾ance method (11): here, the daily turnover of P-sito￾sterol is equal to the sum of the excretion of radioactivity
964 G. Salen, E. H. Ahrens, Jr., and S. M. Grundy

in the fecal neutral and acidic steroids derived from
9-sitosterol-8H administered intravenously, divided by
the specific activity of plasma 8-sitosterol. Values for
the total daily fecal excretion of neutral and acidic
steroids derived by the latter method were almost
identical with values for turnover calculated by kinetic
analysis of the two pool model. This close agreement
of data obtained by two independent methods appears
to validate the assumptions on which both techniques
are based.
Evidence for lack of endogenous synthesis. We have
presented four lines of evidence that f-sitosterol was
not synthesized in our patients. (a) In five patients fed
diets free of f-sitosterol, the fecal neutral steroid fraction
was free of fi-sitosterol, 24-ethyl coprostanol, and 24-
ethyl coprostanone. We use the term "free" operation￾ally, in the sense that the sensitivity of the analytical
methods used in the present work sets an upper con￾centration limit of 65 ng of P-sitosterol per ml of plasma
or per g of homogenate. (b) When patient la was fed
P-sitosterol labeled with P-sitosterol-'H of constant
specific activity, plasma P-sitosterol specific activity
reached the same level as that of the sterol fed. If
9-sitosterol had been synthesized endogenously, the
specific activity of plasma 8-sitosterol would have been
lower than that of the fed sterol, reflecting dilution by
nonradioactive P-sitosterol produced endogenously. (c)
In this patient the specific activity of the fecal neutral
steroids derived from f-sitosterol was identical with
that of the sterol fed. This correspondence would not
have been obtained, had endogenous synthesis of 8-sito￾sterol occurred in the intestinal mucosa. (d) In five stud￾ies a linear relationship was noted between the amount
of j9-sitosterol absorbed per day and that retained in the
body; this line extrapolated to the zero intersect.
Turnover = absorption. Since all our evidence con￾firmed the widely held belief that 8-sitosterol is not syn￾thesized endogenously in man, the only entry into pool
A must have occurred through absorption of exogenous
j3-sitosterol. Therefore, daily turnover of fi-sitosterol
in the steady state, whether calculated by analysis of the
two pool model or through application of the isotopic
balance method, must equal daily absorption. Table VI
shows that 6-14 mg of p-sitosterol was absorbed each
day, or 0.6-5.2% of the daily intake. These very low
values for percentage absorption directly confirm the
previous estimates of Gould (3, 4) and of Borgstrom
(5).
i8-Sitosterol as internal standard for sterol balance
studies. Previous investigators (6-9) attempted to de￾termine the absorption of 8-sitosterol in rats by the
method of sterol balance and reached very different
conclusions from those presented here. They ascribed
to absorption the differences between intake and fecal
output; these balance differences ranged from 22 to 53%.
But it is our belief that losses of this magnitude were
more likely due to degradation of the sterol ring struc￾ture during intestinal transit (10). In the present study
in man, two patients (2 and 3) showed appreciable losses
of nonradioactive dietary fi-sitosterol by the sterol bal￾ance method (35 and 37%, respectively), while in
a third patient (lb) the entire intake of dietary
9-sitosterol was recovered in the feces. Despite these
large differences in recovery that we have ascribed
(10) to varying degrees of degradation of the sterol
ring structure in different patients, the calculations of
daily absorption from kinetic analysis of the two pool
model were remarkably similar in all three patients.
Therefore, we have concluded that the absorption of
P-sitosterol cannot be accurately measured by subtracting
fecal output from dietary intake. Indeed, all of the find￾ings in the present study reinforce our reliance on the
use of nonradioactive dietary P-sitosterol as an internal
standard in sterol balance studies to correct for losses
of cholesterol during intestinal transit: first, endogenous
synthesis of P-sitosterol apparently does not occur in
man, and second, its absorption in the human intestine
is quantitatively so small (< 5% of intake) that it
meets all the criteria of an ideal internal standard for
balance studies on sterols (10).
Differences in metabolism of cholesterol and f8-sito￾sterol. The present data emphasize certain differences in
the metabolism of 8-sitosterol (Cm) which is structurally
similar to cholesterol (CG7) but contains an additional
ethyl group at C-24. We have confirmed that this plant
sterol is absorbed from the intestine only about one￾tenth as effectively as cholesterol and that it is se￾creted into the bile more rapidly than cholesterol. It
also appears to be esterified more slowly than cholesterol
and it is also distributed differently between the two
theoretical body pools. On the other hand, ,3-sitosterol
is converted as rapidly as cholesterol into the same pri￾mary bile acids.
The mechanisms by which the two sterols are distin￾guished at the level of the intestinal mucosal cell re￾main unknown. In the rat, Sylven and Borgstr6m (26)
have noted that the ratio of the two sterols in the in￾testinal lymphatics is the same as that in the mucosal
cells of the intestine; hence, they concluded that the dif￾ference in absorption was not due to differences in any
intracellular process nor in the transport of these sterols
into the intestinal lymphatics. Rather, it seemed to them
more likely that the distinction is made earlier in the
absorptive process, either by a lesser micellar solubili￾zation of plant sterol or by a slower transport through
the outer surface of the mucosal cell. It seems to us,
however, that the rate of esterification of 9-sitosterol
may be the factor limiting its absorption. Swell, Trout,
,8-Sitosterol Metabolism in Man 965

Field, and Treadwell (9) found that, while #-sitosterol,
like cholesterol, is taken up by the intestinal wall, cho￾lesterol is largely esterified before incorporation into
chylomicrons. P-Sitosterol, on the other hand, is ap￾parently not esterified in the intestinal wall: Kuksis
and Huang (27), studying dogs with thoracic duct
fistulas, observed that virtually all of the plant sterols
in chyle are unesterified, whereas most of the cholesterol
in chyle is esterified.
Two factors appear to contribute to the more rapid
fractional turnover rate of fi-sitosterol as compared with
that of cholesterol. First, as discussed above, in passage
through the small intestine at least 10 times more cho￾lesterol than j3-sitosterol is returned into body pools
through reabsorption. Secondly, it seems clear from the
results of the present study that mechanisms exist in the
liver whereby i3-sitosterol is preferentially selected for
more rapid secretion into the bile as neutral sterol. The
mechanisms by which the liver cell distinguishes between
P-sitosterol and cholesterol are just as unclear as in the
case of the intestinal cell. Again, we can visualize the
possibility that a retardation in esterification of #-sito￾sterol, compared to that of cholesterol might make the
free sterol more available for secretion into bile, but
other possibilities should be considered. The intracellular
routes of travel of the two sterols through the liver cell
from plasma to biliary canaliculus are still not known;
nor do we know whether the sterols in the endoplasmic
reticulum are in equilibrium with those in the mito￾chondria or cell sap, nor how inconstant the sterol con￾tents of the different membranous structures may be.
At any rate, we have shown for the first time in any
species that P-sitosterol is converted into the same pri￾mary bile acids as cholesterol, i.e., cholic acid and cheno￾deoxycholic acid. The similarities in isotope ratios in
Table X suggest that the enzymes responsible for this
conversion fail to differentiate one sterol from the other.
At what stage the ethyl group at C-24 is removed re￾mains to be determined. Several species of phytophagous
insects are known to dealkylate C28 and C.% sterols to
provide cholesterol during their larval growth (28).
Therefore, it would be of considerable importance to
ascertain whether the 3-sitosterol incorporated into bile
acids was initially dealkylated to cholesterol, or whether
dealkylation occurred simultaneously with side chain
oxidation during bile acid synthesis.
Striking differences in distribution of the two sterols
in the two theoretical pools of readily exchangeable
sterols (pools A and B) have been demonstrated in
this study. According to theory (12, 24) the two pool
model permits the calculation of the sizes of pools A and
B. For cholesterol the size of pool A can be calculated
from data obtained from specific activity-time curves of
plasma cholesterol; but the size of pool B can be deter￾mined only if entry and removal of cholesterol from
this pool are negligible (except for isotopic exchange
with pool A). If one makes the latter assumption, the
data of Goodman and associates indicate that in six
adult normocholesterolemic men and women pool A
varied from 15 to 27 g; pool B from 27 to 45 g. Our
own data (similarly derived) in 21 adult patients with
hyperlipoproteinemic states showed that pool A varied
from 16 to 32' g, pool B from 21 to 49 g; the lack of
difference between normo- and hypercholesterolemic
patients is astonishing, if true. In contrast, the present
study shows that, for P-sitosterol pool A was invariably
the larger pool, ranging in hypercholesterolemic adults
from 52 to 125 mg, with only 21 to 76 mg in pool B.
Thus, in all adults tested, cholesterol is more richly dis￾tributed in pool B than in pool A; the converse holds for
,-sitosterol. Thus, the total amount of readily exchange￾able cholesterol is vastly greater than for 3-sitosterol,
and furthermore the distribution of the two sterols in the
body is different. Why this difference exists remains
to be shown, but it seems to rule out the possibility of
using the distribution of the plant sterol as a guide to
cholesterol distribution in specific tissue pools.
