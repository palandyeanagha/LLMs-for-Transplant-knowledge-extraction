Insulin resistance (IR) is a common metabolic disorder in chronic kidney disease patients. In the 
elderly population, it is not clear whether IR is associated with lower glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) and mortality. Here, we analyzed the association between IR and GFR, all-cause 
mortality (ACM), or cardiovascular mortality (CVM) in the elderly population. This was a 
community-based prospective study. Participants were selected by random sampling from those 
aged ≥ 65 years in Seongnam, a satellite city of Seoul, Korea. A total of 743 participants were 
analyzed. IR was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR). The mean age was 76.4 ± 9.3 years. After multivariate analysis, HOMA-IR was 
negatively associated with GFR as a continuous variable (per 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase, β = 
−0.10, P = 0.004). Analyzing GFR as a categorical variable, HOMA-IR was still higher those with 
GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
 (GFR < 60 vs. 60-89 and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
: 1.3 vs. 1.2 and 1.1, 
respectively; P = 0.025 and 0.019) by covariance analysis. During the follow-up period of 62.9 ± 
16.9 months, there were 168 (22.6%) cases of ACM and 47 (6.3%) cases of CVM. Those in the 
third quintile HOMA-IR group showed the lowest ACM rate, compared with the other quintiles 
(P < 0.001). CVM was not significantly associated with HOMA-IR. In conclusion, a lower GFR is 
associated with higher IR in the elderly population. Moreover, the lowest or the highest levels of 
HOMA-IR are associated with higher mortality rates.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health 
problem; the prevalence of CKD has increased in the 
Korean population (Kim et al. 2009) and worldwide (Zhang 
and Rothenbacher 2008). The proportions of elderly people 
in the Korean population and the prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) according to age are also increasing. Aging 
(Hemmelgarn et al. 2006; Zhang and Rothenbacher 2008) 
and DM (Humphrey et al. 1989) are well-known risk fac￾tors for CKD. Therefore, older adults show a higher preva￾lence of CKD (Hemmelgarn et al. 2006; Zhang and 
Rothenbacher 2008) and DM (Humphrey et al. 1989), and 
this is characterized by insulin resistance (IR) (Scheen 
2005).
Several studies have shown that non-diabetic patients 
with mild renal dysfunction (Fliser et al. 1998) and low 
estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have higher lev￾els of IR (Chen et al. 2003). IR and concomitant hyperin￾sulinemia are associated with an increased prevalence of 
CKD (Chen et al. 2003). In contrast, some studies did not 
find that lower GFR was associated with higher IR in the 
general population (Mohteshamzadeh et al. 2009; Park et 
al. 2013). In a study in an adult population undergoing rou￾tine health check-ups, Park et al. (2013) found that decrea￾sed GFR was not directly related to increased IR, but that 
parameters of metabolic syndrome were associated with 
decreased renal function rather than increased IR. In the 

272 H.J. Kim et al.
elderly population, it is not clear whether lower GFR is 
associated with higher IR, and whether there is a relation￾ship between IR and mortality. One recently published 
clinical study has shown that hypomagnesemia may be 
related to IR and a risk factor for mortality in CKD patients 
(Van Laecke et al. 2013).
The euglycemic clamp method is regarded as the “gold 
standard” for measuring IR; however, the method is inva￾sive, time-consuming, and costly (Wallace and Matthews 
2002). The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA￾IR) is a mathematical model that calculates values for insu￾lin sensitivity. Estimates of IR made using the HOMA-IR 
index are well correlated with IR values determined using 
the euglycemic clamp method (Matthews et al. 1985).
Here, we analyzed the associations between HOMA￾IR index and GFR, all-cause mortality (ACM), and cardio￾vascular mortality (CVM) in non-diabetic community￾dwelling Korean older adults.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
The present study was conducted as part of the Korean 
Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) (Park et al. 
2007). KLoSHA was designed as a population-based, prospective 
cohort study of health, aging, and common geriatric disease of 
Korean older adults aged 65 years and over in Seongnam, a satellite 
city of Seoul, Korea. The protocol of KLoSHA was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang 
Hospital in 2005 and 2010, and followed the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. KLoSHA began in August 2005. Seongnam, 
one of the largest suburbs of Seoul, had a total population of 931,019 
on August 1, 2005, including 61,730 (6.6%) people aged 65 years or 
older (Fig. 1). At first, a simple random sample (n = 1,118; 1.81%) 
was drawn from a roster of 61,730 people on August 1, 2005, and let￾ters and telephone calls were used to invite these subjects to partici￾pate in the study. Of the 1,118 subjects invited, 698 agreed to partici￾pate in the baseline KLoSHA study. Second, all elderly people aged 
85 years or older living in Seongnam (3,136 subjects) were also con￾tacted by letter or telephone and invited to participate, and 302 per￾698 persons agreed 
to participate in KLoSHA study

KLoSHA was designed as a population-based, prospective cohort study of Korean older adults aged 65 years in Seong￾nam, a satellite city of Seoul, Korea. Seongnam had a total population of 931,019 on August 1, 2005, including 61,730 
(6.6%) people aged 65 years or older. At first, a simple random sample (n = 1,118; 1.81%) was drawn from a roster of 
61,730 people on August 1, 2005. Of the 1,118 subjects invited, 698 agreed to participate in the baseline KLoSHA 
study. Second, all elderly people aged 85 years or older living in Seongnam (3,136 subjects) were also contacted by let￾ter or telephone and invited to participate, and 302 persons agreed to participate in the baseline KLoSHA study. Of a 
total of 1,000 subjects in the KLoSHA study, 760 persons did not have DM. Of them, 743 whose HOMA-IR and GFR 
levels were available were analyzed in this study. The follow-up study was conducted from May 2010 to December 
2011.
*Mortality was determined by direct contact and through the Korea National Statistical Office (KNSO) database.

sons agreed to participate in the baseline KLoSHA study. Of a total 
of 1,000 subjects in the KLoSHA study, 760 persons did not have 
DM. Of them, 743 whose HOMA-IR and GFR levels were available 
were analyzed in this study. In the initial study, all participants under￾went a standardized clinical interview and laboratory testing. The 
follow-up study was conducted from May 2010 to December 2011. A 
total of 358 (48.2%) subjects were followed-up, while 168 (22.6%) 
had died, 148 (19.9%) declined to participate in follow-up, 51 (6.9%) 
had moved to another region, and 30 (4.0%) were unable to be con￾tacted. All evaluations were conducted at Seoul National University 
Bundang Hospital.
Demographic and clinical data
After an overnight fast of at least 12 hours’ duration, subjects 
completed the questionnaires and underwent blood and urine tests. 
DM was defined as a reported history of DM, a plasma fasting glu￾cose level of ≥ 126 mg/dL, a serum hemoglobin A1c level ≥ 6.5%, or 
the active use of an oral hypoglycemic agent. Hypertension was 
defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater, diastolic 
blood pressure of 90 mmHg or greater, or the use of blood pressure￾lowering medication. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) history was 
defined as a self-reported history of exertional chest pain, angina pec￾toris, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention 
or coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary artery endarterectomy, 
insertion of a pacemaker, congestive heart failure, or other cardiac 
operation. Proteinuria was defined as urine albumin trace or greater, 
determined by a dipstick urine test, and hematuria was defined as a 
urine red blood cell count of ≥ 5 per high-power field under examina￾tion by light microscopy. Serum creatinine level was measured by 
the alkaline picrate Jaffe kinetic method using an automatic analyzer 
(Toshiba 200FR, Tokyo, Japan). Serum creatinine levels were cali￾brated to an assay traceable on an isotope dilution mass spectrometry 
(IDMS) device (Roche Diagnostics). Estimated GFR was calculated 
using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) 
Collaboration equation (Levey et al. 2009). IR was assessed by 
HOMA-IR [fasting plasma glucose concentration (mg/L) × fasting 
plasma insulin (µU/mL)/405] index. Plasma glucose concentration 
was measured using the glucose oxidase method and a YSI 2300 
STAT glucose analyzer (Yellow Spring Instrument Co., Yellow 
Springs, OH). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured using a 
radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Linco Research, Chesterfield, MO). The 
interassay coefficient of variation was 4%.
Outcome measurement
We analyzed the correlation between HOMA-IR index and GFR 
levels, and the association between HOMA-IR index and ACM and 
CVM. GFR and HOMA-IR index values were analyzed as continu￾ous and categorical variables. Participants were categorized into 3 
GFR groups. The normal GFR group had a GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 
m2
, the mild renal dysfunction group had a GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 
m2
, and the moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction group had a GFR 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
. HOMA-IR index values were categorized into 
quintile groups. Data on ACM and CVM were obtained from the 
Korea National Statistical Office (KNSO) and by direct telephone 
contact.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were analyzed by χ² test and presented as 
frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were analyzed by 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and presented as mean ± 
standard deviation. After Pearson’s correlation coefficient testing, 
multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine factors 
independently associated with HOMA-IR index. Adjusted HOMA-IR 
index values were derived and compared between GFR groups using 
covariance analysis (ANCOVA). The χ² test was used to show fre￾quency of mortality among groups and Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to analyze survival rate among groups as univariate analysis. 
We used Cox proportional hazards models to detect the independent 
risk factors related to mortality. P-values of < 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. SPSS Statistics software (SPSS version 19.0, 
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Subjects characteristics
Of the 1,000 subjects enrolled in the KLoSHA cohort, 
743 non-diabetic participants with HOMA-IR index and 
GFR values available were included. The mean age was 
76.4 ± 9.3 years, and 427 (57.5%) subjects were female 
(Table 1). Hypertension and CVD were identified in 70.0% 
and 63.8% of participants, respectively. The mean 
HOMA-IR index value was 1.2 ± 0.9. The mean serum 
creatinine level was 0.9 ± 0.3 mg/dL and the mean GFR 
value was 72.4 ± 16.8 mL/min/1.73 m2
.
Clinical characteristics of the GFR groups
There were 114 subjects in the normal GFR group, 451 
subjects in the mild renal dysfunction group, and 178 sub￾jects in the moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction group 
(Table 1). The participants in the moderate-to-severe renal 
dysfunction group were older (P < 0.001). The proportion 
of women was lower in the moderate-to-severe renal dys￾function group (P = 0.018). The prevalence of hyperten￾sion (P = 0.024) and CVD (P = 0.025) increased with 
decreasing GFR level. Hemoglobin (P < 0.001) and high￾density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P = 0.002) levels 
were lowest in the moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction 
group. The frequency of proteinuria was highest in the 
moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction group (P < 0.001).
Insulin resistance in the GFR groups and factors related to 
insulin resistance
HOMA-IR index increased as GFR decreased, as 
shown by simple regression analysis (r = −0.078, P = 0.034). 
Linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, hyper￾tension, hemoglobin, albumin, total cholesterol, and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels also showed a negative rela￾tionship between HOMA-IR index value and GFR as a con￾tinuous variable (per 10 mL/min/1.73 m2
 change; β = −0.10, 
P = 0.004). Other factors, such as hemoglobin level (β = 
0.07, P = 0.002), ALT level (β = 0.02, P < 0.001), hyperten￾sion (β = 0.15, P = 0.031), and gender (male vs. female, β = 
0.29, P < 0.001) were also associated with HOMA-IR index 
values. When we estimated the HOMA-IR index values by 
ANCOVA adjusted for related factors, the moderate-to￾severe renal dysfunction group had higher HOMA-IR val-

274 H.J. Kim et al.
ues than the other 2 groups. The mean HOMA-IR index 
value in the moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction group 
(those with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
) was 1.3 (95% con￾fidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.46), while that in the mild renal 
dysfunction group (those with GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2
)
was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08-1.23; P = 0.025) and that in the nor￾mal GFR group (those with GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
) 
was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.93-1.24; P = 0.019) (Fig. 2).
All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality according 
to insulin resistance
During the follow-up period of 62.9 ± 16.9 months, 
there were 168 (22.6%) cases of ACM and 47 (6.3%) cases 
of CVM. ACM rate was highest in the moderate-to-severe 
renal dysfunction group: normal GFR group, 10.5% (12 
subjects); mild renal dysfunction group, 18.4% (83 sub￾jects); and moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction group, 
41.0% (73 subjects) (P < 0.001, Fig. 3A). When we ana￾lyzed survival rates by Kaplan-Meier method, ACM rate 
was also different among GFR groups (< 60 vs. 60-89 and 
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
: P < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively, 
Log-rank test) (data not shown). We divided the partici￾pants according to quintile level of HOMA-IR index. ACM 
rate differed according to HOMA-IR: first quintile group, 
35.1% (52 subjects); second quintile group, 29.2% (42 sub￾jects); third quintile group, 15.4% (23 subjects); fourth 
quintile group, 17.4% (26 subjects); and fifth quintile 
group, 16.9% (25 subjects) (P < 0.001, Fig. 3B). When we 
analyzed survival rates by Kaplan-Meier method, ACM rate 
was also different among HOMA-IR quintiles (1st vs. 2nd, 
3rd, 4th, and 5th quintile: P = 0.253, < 0.001, < 0.001, and 
< 0.001, respectively, Log-rank test) (data not shown). In a 
Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the factors 
related to mortality, the first, second, and fifth quintile 
groups had increased ACM rates compared to the third 
quintile group. The hazard ratio (HR) values were 2.925 
(95% CI, 1.69-5.09), 2.620 (95% CI, 1.50-4.59), and 2.010 
(95% CI, 1.06-3.90), respectively (Table 2). The estimated

GFR and Mortality According to IR in Korean Elderly 275
5-year survival rates according to HOMA-IR group were 
70.3% in the first quintile group, 73.2% in the second quin￾tile group, 86.6% in the third quintile group, 85.2% in the 
fourth quintile group, and 76.5% in the fifth quintile group 
(Log-rank test, P < 0.001). We searched for risk factors for 
ACM among the HOMA-IR quintile groups (Table 3). 
Participants in the first quintile HOMA-IR group were sig￾nificantly older (P < 0.001) than those in the other quintile 
groups and had the lowest levels of total cholesterol (P < 
0.001), hemoglobin (P < 0.001), and body mass index 
(BMI) (P < 0.001). We also analyzed the interactions 
between HOMA-IR values and other risk factors associated 
with mortality. In the estimation of ACM, HOMA-IR index 
values interacted with age (P-interaction = 0.004), hemo￾globin level (P-interaction < 0.001), total cholesterol level 
(P-interaction < 0.001), GFR (P-interaction < 0.001), and 
BMI (P-interaction = 0.042). However, HOMA-IR 
remained an independent risk factor for ACM after adjust￾ment for these factors.
CVM rate significantly increased with decreasing 
GFR. The rate of CVM in the normal GFR group — was 
3.5% (4 subjects), while the rates in the mild renal dysfunc￾tion group and the moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction 
group were 5.1% (23 subjects) and 11.2% (20 subjects), 
respectively (P = 0.026, Fig. 3C). When we analyzed sur￾vival rates by Kaplan-Meier method, CVM rate was also 
different among GFR groups (< 60 vs. 60-89 and ≥ 90 mL/
min/1.73 m2
: P = 0.005 and 0.005, respectively, Log-rank 
test) (data not shown). CVM rate also differed among the 
HOMA-IR quintile groups (Fig. 3D). CVM rate was 10.8% 
(16 subjects) in the first quintile group, 7.4% (11 subjects) 
in the second quintile group, 4.0% (6 subjects) in the third 
quintile group, 4.7% (7 subjects) in the fourth quintile 
group, and 4.7% (7 subjects) in the fifth quintile group (P = 
0.019). When we analyzed survival rates by Kaplan-Meier 
method, CVM rate was also different among HOMA-IR 
quintiles (1st vs. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintile: P = 0.316, 
0.018, 0.035, and 0.040, respectively, Log-rank test) (data 
not shown). However, in a Cox proportional hazards model 
adjusted for age, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, HOMA-IR 
quintile group, hemoglobin level, and diastolic blood pres￾sure, the independent parameters related to CVM were age 
(HR, 1.921; 95% CI, 1.59-2.32; P < 0.001) and CRP level 
(HR, 1.314; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59; P = 0.006).
Discussion
We found that GFR was negatively correlated with 
HOMA-IR index values in non-diabetic Korean older 
adults. HOMA-IR quintile group was related to ACM risk, 
and the third quintile group showed the lowest incidence of 
ACM.
In younger adults, the association between low GFR 
and IR is controversial. Kobayashi et al. (2005) showed 
that the glucose disposal rate of 29 patients with CKD 
(mean age 56 ± 14.6 years) was significantly lower than 
that of healthy subjects. However, some studies did not 
find that lower GFR was associated with IR in younger 
adults. Johns et al. (2012) found that IR was not signifi￾cantly associated with GFR in non-diabetic subjects aged 
43-59 years. They explained that kidney dysfunction is 
related to components of metabolic syndrome, such as 
hypertension, rather than IR. Satirapoj et al. (2005) found 
that HOMA-IR was not dependent on GFR in non-diabetic 
adults. They determined that total body fat was an indepen￾dent risk factor for IR. However, many studies have shown 
that GFR levels are negatively correlated with IR in 
younger adults. Similarly, in the elderly population, most 
studies have shown that GFR is negatively correlated with 
IR. Pham et al. (2012) demonstrated that a lower GFR was 
associated with degree of IR in subjects aged ≥ 65 years. In 
that report, every 10 mL/min/1.73 m2
 reduction in GFR was 
associated with a 2.2% increase in fasting insulin concen￾tration and a 1.1% decrease in insulin sensitivity index. 
Among participants of the Health, Aging and Body 
Composition study (a study that included older individuals 
aged 70-79 years), kidney function was independently asso￾ciated with IR (as defined by the highest quartile level of 
HOMA-IR) (Landau et al. 2011). There are no studies that 
have shown a lack of correlation between GFR and IR in 
the elderly population. Our findings of an association 
between lower GFR and degree of IR (as measured by 
HOMA-IR) are similar to previous results reported for the 
elderly population.

IR is a known complication of end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) and contributes to metabolic abnormalities in 
CKD, including uremic toxins, metabolic acidosis, and vita￾min D deficiency (Mak 1998; Kielstein and Zoccali 2005). 
In addition, IR and CKD share a number of risk factors, 
such as obesity, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyle. It could 
be that these risk factors, along with vitamin D deficiency, 
are common in the aging and elderly population. Therefore, 
a decreased GFR is also correlated with degree of IR in the 
elderly population. Furthermore, development of IR occurs 
via multi-factorial mechanisms. Aging is associated with 
IR via changes in glucose tolerance, reduced insulin sensi￾tivity and secretion, and increased peripheral insulin resis￾tance (Broughton and Taylor 1991). In addition, reduced 
intake of carbohydrates, increased body weight and fat 
mass, and decreased fat-free mass can lead to IR in the 
elderly (Chen et al. 1988). In our cohort, participants in the 
first quintile of HOMA-IR values were older and had lower 
BMI values and total cholesterol levels. Obese subjects 
have greater IR than non-obese subjects (Goodpaster et al. 
1997) and aging-related hyperlipidemia is associated with 
IR (Flannery et al. 2012). It is possible that lower BMI val￾ues and lower lipid levels could have affected HOMA-IR 
index values in our first HOMA-IR quintile group.
We investigated ACM and CVM to determine the 
impact of IR on outcomes. There are several reports of the 
relationship between IR, ACM, and CVM in the general 
population. Ausk et al. (2010) showed that HOMA-IR is 
associated with ACM (adjusted HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.01-
1.3] in a comparison of successive quartiles of HOMA-IR 
values in a linear model) in subjects with normal BMI 
(< 25.2 kg/m2
, aged ≥ 17 years), and that CVM was signifi￾cantly increased in the second, third, and fourth HOMA-IR 
quartiles compared with the lowest HOMA-IR quartile

GFR and Mortality According to IR in Korean Elderly 277
group. Another study in patients with a mean age of 55.4 ± 
10.7 years showed that HOMA-IR was an independent pre￾dictor of CVM in patients with ERSD (adjusted HR, 4.24 
[95% CI, 1.83-11.55], top vs. lower 2 tertiles), but was not 
significantly associated with non-CVM (Shinohara et al. 
2002). However, few studies have shown a correlation 
between IR and CVM or ACM in the elderly population. In 
our study, we showed that elderly subjects in not only the 
fifth quintile of HOMA-IR values but also the first quintile 
of HOMA-IR values had increased rates of ACM. We pos￾tulate that other factors could have influenced ACM in the 
first quintile HOMA-IR group. ACM increases with age in 
the elderly population. In addition, anemia, lower baseline 
hemoglobin levels, and hemoglobin decline are associated 
with increased mortality in the elderly population (Zakai et 
al. 2013). Zakai et al. (2005) showed that being in the low￾est hemoglobin quintile was independently associated with 
mortality in an elderly cohort. In the general population, 
obesity is an important risk factor for mortality (Jee et al. 
2006). However, this relationship is not evident in the 
elderly population: Janssen et al. (2005) showed that higher 
BMI, after adjustment for waist circumference, is associ￾ated with lower risk of mortality in older adults. They sug￾gested that BMI could reflect a higher level of lean mass in 
subjects with the same waist circumference; lean mass was 
negatively correlated with ACM. Another study also 
showed that being underweight seems to be a stronger pre￾dictor of negative outcomes than obesity in older adults 
(Dey et al. 2001). BMI is not a reliable indicator of obe￾sity; other factors, such as body composition and nutritional 
state, might be better predictors of mortality in the elderly 
population. Older age, lower baseline hemoglobin level, 
and lower BMI in the first quintile HOMA-IR group could 
have led to the increased rate of ACM in our elderly popu￾lation. HOMA-IR had interactions with hemoglobin level, 
total cholesterol level, GFR, and BMI. Even though 
HOMA-IR is an independent risk factor for ACM after 
adjustment, we postulated that age, hemoglobin level, and 
BMI might have a greater effect on ACM than IR. In con￾trast to other studies in the general population, CVM was 
not correlated with HOMA-IR in our elderly population. 
We postulated that different baseline characteristics in our 
elderly population might have influenced the CVM results. 
Shinohara et al. (2002) showed that the highest HOMA-IR 
value (1.40 to 4.59) was an independent predictor of CVM, 
compared with the lower 2 tertiles (HOMA-IR values of

0.28 to 1.39) in ESRD patients, suggesting that there is a 
threshold level of HOMA-IR in relation to CVM. Another 
study (Ausk et al. 2010) showed that those in the top 3 
quartiles of IR (HOMA-IR > 1.4) had uniformly elevated 
CVM compared with those in the lowest quartile 
(HOMA-IR ≤ 1.4). In our elderly population, HOMA-IR 
was relatively low, compared with values obtained in other 
studies. In addition, aging and high CRP levels are usually 
risk factors for CVM; however, participants in our fifth 
HOMA-IR quintile were younger, and CRP levels were 
similar in the 5 HOMR-IR groups. This could have influ￾enced the CVM results in our study.
Our study has several strengths. Ours was a commu￾nity-based prospective cohort study in the elderly popula￾tion: the participants were representative of the elderly 
urban population. There are few studies of the association 
between GFR and IR in the elderly population, and there￾fore our study provides important data. Other strengths 
include the use of IDMS-traceable creatinine at a single 
institution (suitable for calculating GFR via the CKD-EPI 
equation) and the fact that ACM rates were surveyed by 
direct telephone contact as well as through the KNSO. 
However, our study had several limitations. We used the 
HOMA-IR index to estimate IR. The euglycemic clamp 
method is regarded as the “gold standard” for measuring 
IR; however, this method is invasive, time-consuming, and 
costly (DeFronzo et al. 1979; Wallace and Matthews 2002). 
Estimations of IR from the HOMA-IR index are well corre￾lated with those obtained by the euglycemic clamp method 
(Matthews et al. 1985); therefore, we used the HOMA-IR 
index in this study. We calculated GFR via the CKD-EPI 
equation rather than through direct measurement. Even 
though the CKD-EPI equation has not been fully verified as 
a tool to estimate kidney function in the Korean population, 
the CKD-EPI equation is recommended by the Kidney 
Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines 
(Levey et al. 2011). Also, many studies have shown that 
the CKD-EPI equation is more accurate than the 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study 
equation (Murata et al. 2011; Earley et al. 2012), and a bet￾ter predictor of ACM, CVM, and ESRD (Matsushita et al. 
2012). Other limitations include the fact that CVD was 
investigated using data input according to diagnosis, which 
may have been subject to inaccuracies.
In conclusion, a lower GFR is associated with 
increased IR in the elderly Korean population. Moreover, 
elderly Korean people with the lowest and highest 
HOMA-IR values have higher mortality risk.
