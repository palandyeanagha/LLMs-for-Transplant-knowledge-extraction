Abstract
The period of hypoxia is an important priming event for the
vascular dysfunction that accompanies reperfusion, with
endothelial cells (ECs) and neutrophils (PMNs) playing a
central role. We hypothesized that EC Weibel-Palade (WP)
body exocytosis during the hypoxic/ischemic period during
organ preservation permits brisk PMN recruitment into
postischemic tissue, a process further amplified in an oxi￾dant-rich milieu. Exposure of human umbilical vein ECs to
a hypoxic environment (pO2 ø 20 torr) stimulated release of
von Willebrand factor (vWF), stored in EC WP bodies, as
well as increased expression of the WP body–derived PMN
adhesion molecule P-selectin at the EC surface. Increased
binding of 111In-labeled PMNs to hypoxic EC monolayers
(compared with normoxic controls) was blocked with a
blocking antibody to P-selectin, but was not affected by a
nonblocking control antibody. Although increased P-selec￾tin expression and vWF release were also noted during re￾oxygenation, hypoxia alone (even in the presence of antioxi￾dants) was sufficient to increase WP body exocytosis. To
determine the relevance of these observations to hypother￾mic cardiac preservation, during which the pO2
 within the
cardiac vasculature declines to similarly low levels, experi￾ments were performed in a rodent (rat and mouse) cardiac
preservation/transplantation model. Immunodepletion of
recipient PMNs or administration of a blocking anti–P￾selectin antibody before transplantation resulted in reduced
graft neutrophil infiltration and improved graft survival,
compared with identically preserved hearts transplanted
into control recipients. To establish the important role of en￾dothelial P-selectin expression on the donor vasculature,
murine cardiac transplants were performed using homozy￾gous P-selectin deficient and wild-type control donor hearts
flushed free of blood/platelets before preservation/trans￾plantation. P-selectin–null hearts transplanted into wild￾type recipients demonstrated a marked (13-fold) reduction
in graft neutrophil infiltration and increased graft survival
compared with wild-type hearts transplanted into wild-type
recipients. To determine whether coronary endothelial WP
exocytosis may occur during cardiac preservation in hu￾mans, the release of vWF into the coronary sinus (CS) was
measured in 32 patients during open heart surgery. CS sam￾ples obtained at the start and conclusion of the ischemic pe￾riod demonstrated an increase in CS vWF antigen (by
ELISA) consisting of predominantly high molecular weight
multimers (by immunoelectrophoresis). These data suggest
that EC WP exocytosis occurs during hypothermic cardiac
preservation, priming the vasculature to recruit PMNs rap￾idly during reperfusion. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:493–500.)

Introduction
Endothelial cells (EC)1
 adapt to hypoxia with a characteristic
repertoire of responses (1), ranging from increased expression
of endothelin (2) to increased synthesis of basic fibroblast
growth factor (3). Recent studies have indicated that many
features of the EC response to hypoxia parallel features of the
inflammatory response; hypoxia selectively upregulates EC
expression of IL-1 (4), -6 (5), and -8 (6); platelet-activating fac￾tor (PAF) (7, 8), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (4),
which serve to fuel neutrophil (PMN) recruitment, adhesion,
and activation at ischemic loci. Although these mechanisms
may explain the later phases of reperfusion injury, the rapidity
with which PMNs are recruited to reperfused myocardium af￾ter a period of hypothermic preservation suggests that mecha￾nisms are involved that do not require de novo protein synthe￾sis. In this regard, P-selectin may figure prominently in the
earliest phases of PMN adhesion to the reperfused vascula￾ture, as ECs may rapidly express preformed P-selectin from
subplasmalemmal storage sites in Weibel-Palade body (WP)
(9) membranes in response to the abundant oxygen-free radi￾cals generated in the reperfusion milieu (10–12). Furthermore,
recent data have pointed to a role for P-selectin–mediated leu￾kocyte arrest in leukostasis and tissue damage associated with
lung injury (13) and cardiac ischemia (14). Taken together,
these findings led us to hypothesize that the hypoxic/ischemic
period associated with hypothermic myocardial preservation
primes the vasculature for its characteristic response during
reperfusion by displaying P-selectin prominently at the EC
surface before reperfusion, serving as a spark that ignites and
amplifies the subsequent inflammatory response.

Our experiments were designed to establish whether hy￾poxia per se (or hypothermic cardiac preservation, as occurs
during cardiac surgery, in which the pO2
 within the coronary
bed declines to pO2 , 20 torr) (15) would result in WP body
exocytosis. Furthermore, we wished to determine the role of
P-selectin–dependent PMN adhesion in the cardiac graft fail￾ure that characteristically follows a period of prolonged hypo￾thermic preservation. Our results show that hypoxia is suffi￾cient to induce EC WP body exocytosis, even in the absence of
reoxygenation (and presence of antioxidants), and that the re￾sulting P-selectin expression causes ECs to bind PMNs in vitro.
In rodents, the adverse consequences of P-selectin expression
after hypothermic cardiac preservation can be completely ab￾rogated either by neutrophil depletion, by P-selectin blockade,
or by transplanting hearts whose ECs fail to express P-selectin.
Because WP body exocytosis also occurs in patients undergo￾ing open heart surgery during the period of hypothermic car￾diac preservation, these data suggest that P-selectin blockade
may represent a target for pharmacological intervention to im￾prove cardiac preservation in humans.
Methods
EC culture and exposure of cells to hypoxia or hypoxia/
reoxygenation
Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were prepared from umbilical
cords and grown in culture by the method of Jaffe (16) as modified by
Thornton (17). Experiments used confluent ECs (passages 1–4)
grown in medium 199 supplemented with FBS (15%; Gemini, Bio￾products, Inc., Calabasas, CA), human serum (5%; Gemini Bioprod￾ucts, Inc.), endothelial growth supplement (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO), heparin (90 mg/ml; Sigma Chemical Co.), and antibiotics,
as described (17). When ECs achieved confluence, experiments were
performed by placing cultures in an environmental chamber (Coy
Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI), which provided a controlled
temperature (37°C) and atmosphere with the indicated amount of ox￾ygen and carbon dioxide (5%) and the balance made up of nitrogen.
Use of this chamber for cell culture experiments has been described
previously (15, 18). During exposure of ECs to hypoxia (for a maxi￾mum of 16 h), the oxygen tension in the culture medium was 14–18
torr, and there was no change in the medium pH. Reoxygenation was
performed by placing ECs in an ambient atmosphere containing car￾bon dioxide (5%) at 37°C.
Measurement of WP exocytosis
ECs were plated into 24-well plates, rinsed three times with HBSS,
and then exposed to hypoxia or to normoxia for the indicated dura￾tions. For experiments in which von Willebrand factor (vWF) was
measured, cells were maintained in serum-free medium. All other EC
experiments were performed in the EC growth medium described
above. For measurement of vWF, 200-µL aliquots of culture superna￾tant were removed at the indicated times, and a commercially avail￾able ELISA (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT), based on
a polyclonal goat anti–human vWF antibody, was performed on du￾plicate specimens, with a standard curve generated using purified hu￾man vWF antigen supplied by the same vendor. EC P-selectin expres￾sion was determined by measuring the specific binding of a murine
monoclonal anti–human P-selectin antibody (WAPS 12.2 clone; En￾dogen, Inc., Cambridge, MA; this is an IgG1 that recognizes a cal￾cium-sensitive epitope and blocks P-selectin–dependent neutrophil
adhesion [Wicher, J., personal communication]). Antibody was radio￾labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase method (19) using Enzymo￾beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), stored at 4°C and used
within 1 wk of labeling. Binding assays were performed on HUVECs
plated on 96-well plates, in which fresh M199 with 0.1% BSA (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added immediately before each ex￾periment. Cells were placed in a humidified environment at 37°C and
exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (in the presence or absence of 50
mM probucol, as indicated; Sigma Chemical Co.) for the indicated du￾rations. Cell monolayers were fixed for 15 min with 1% parafor￾maldehyde10 (cells exposed to hypoxia were fixed while still within
the hypoxic environment), visually inspected to ensure that the
monolayers remained intact, and washed twice with HBSS containing
0.5% BSA. Monolayers were then exposed to 105
 cpm of 125I-labeled
anti–P-selectin antibody (WAPS 12.2) in the presence of 200 mg/mL
of either unlabeled blocking antibody (WAPS 12.2) or nonblocking
anti–P-selectin IgG of the same isotype (anti–GMP-140, AC1.2 clone;
Becton Dickinson & Co., San Jose, CA) (20, 21). After binding for 1 h
at 37°C, monolayers were washed four times with HBSS containing
0.5% BSA, and bound antibody was eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in
PBS (200 mL/well) and counted. For certain experiments, cyclohex￾imide (10 mg/mL; Sigma Chemical Co.) was added at the start of the
4-h normoxic or hypoxic period, as indicated. In separate experi￾ments, designed to determine the degree of inhibition of protein syn￾thesis by cycloheximide treatment, ECs were incubated with me￾thionine- and cysteine-poor minimal essential medium (GIBCO
BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) in the presence of [35S]-methionine and
[
35S]-cysteine (either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, 10
mg/mL) (3). After 4 h of normoxic exposure, trichloroacetic acid–pre￾cipitable material was collected and counted.
Preparation of human PMNs and measurement of binding
In brief, citrated blood from healthy donors was diluted 1:1 with NaCl
(0.9%) followed by gradient ultracentrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque
(Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). After hypotonic lysis of
residual erythrocytes (20-s exposure to distilled H2O followed by re￾constitution with 1.8% NaCl), PMNs were suspended in HBSS with 5
mg/mL of HSA (HBSS/HSA). 50–200 3 106
 PMNs were suspended
in HBSS/HSA in the presence of 0.2–0.5 mCi of 111In-oxine (Amer￾sham Mediphysics, Port Washington, NY) for 15 min at 37°C. After
washing with HBSS/HSA, PMNs were gently pelleted (450 g), and re￾suspended in HBSS/HSA to a final concentration of 5.5 3 106
 PMNs/
mL. After gentle agitation, 100 mL of the radiolabeled PMN suspen￾sion was added to each well at the indicated time, incubated for 30
min at 37°C, and then washed four times with HBSS/HSA. Monolay￾ers were then treated with 1 N NaOH, and the contents of each well
were withdrawn and counted. 
Heterotopic rat and mouse cardiac transplant model
Cardiac transplants were performed using the Ono-Lindsey hetero￾topic isograft model of cardiac transplantation (15, 18, 22). Briefly,
male Lewis rats (250–300 g, Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapo￾lis, IN) were anesthetized and heparinized, and the donor heart was
rapidly harvested after hypothermic high potassium cardioplegic ar￾rest. Hearts were preserved by flushing the coronary arteries with
4°C lactated Ringer’s solution (LR) (Baxter, Edison, NJ) and by 16 h
of immersion in the same solution at 4°C, followed by heterotopic
transplantation into gender/strain-matched recipients, with sequen￾tial donor and recipient aortic and donor pulmonary arterial/recipient
inferior vena caval anastomoses performed. Graft survival was as￾sessed by the presence/absence of cardiac electrical/mechanical activ￾ity exactly 10 min after reestablishment of blood flow, after which the
graft was excised and neutrophil infiltration was quantified by my￾eloperoxidase activity, measured as previously described (15, 18). For
certain experiments, neutrophil depletion of recipient rats was ac￾complished by administering a polyclonal rabbit anti–rat neutrophil
antibody (23–25) (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury,
NY) as a single intravenous injection 24 h before the transplantation
procedure. Neutrophil depletion in these animals was confirmed and
quantified by counting remaining neutrophils, identified on Wright￾Giemsa–stained smears of peripheral blood. In other experiments, a
blocking anti–P-selectin IgG (PB1.3, 250 mg/rat; Cytel, San Diego,
CA) (13, 14, 26) was administered intravenously 10 min before the
onset of reperfusion. Murine heart transplants were performed in an

identical fashion using homozygous P-selectin–null or wild-type con￾trol male mice with a C57BL/6J background (27), with the harvested
hearts immediately flushed free of native blood with 1.0 mL of 4°C
LR administered down a cross-clamped aortic root followed by a pe￾riod of hypothermic preservation consisting of 3 h of immersion in
LR at 4°C.
Measurement of vWF in human coronary sinus effluent
Human coronary sinus (CS) samples. After informed consent was
obtained, CS blood was obtained at the start and conclusion of rou￾tine cardiac surgery in an unselected series of 32 patients, with simul￾taneous sampling of peripheral (arterial) blood in six. CS samples
were obtained from a retrograde perfusion catheter, which was rou￾tinely placed in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma
samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 g to sediment cellular ele￾ments, and the plasma was aliquoted and frozen at 270°C until the
time of assay. ELISAs were performed for vWF (as described above)
and thrombomodulin (Asserchron Thrombomodulin, American Bio￾products, Parsippany, NJ). 
vWF immunoelectrophoresis. Multimeric composition of the
vWF in CS plasma samples and EC supernatants was evaluated by
performing agarose gel immunoelectrophoresis. Samples were di￾luted 1:10, 1:20, and 1:30 (as indicated) and incubated for 30 min at
37°C in native sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Samples (20
mL) were then electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel (0.675 g low Mr
agarose [Bio-Rad Laboratories]; 0.045 g SDS; 45 mL Tris-tricine SDS
buffer [Bio-Rad Laboratories]). Molecular weight markers run simul￾taneously on agarose gels were visualized by marking and dividing
the gel, with molecular weight marker locations assigned by Coo￾massie blue staining. The remaining half of the gel was washed in so￾dium borate (0.01 M) for 30 min followed by overnight electro￾phoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was
washed with washing buffer consisting of Tris-buffered saline (pH
7.5) with 0.05% Tween-20, and then blocked for 1 h with 50 mL of
washing buffer containing 2.5 g of Carnation nonfat dry milk (Nestle
Food Co., Glendale, CA). After rinsing with physiologic saline, the
membrane was immersed overnight in washing buffer containing 1 g/
dL gelatin and a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti–human vWF serum
(American Bioproducts). After washing five times with washing
buffer, the membrane was immersed for 3 h with gentle shaking in
washing buffer containing 1 g/dL gelatin and 16.6 mL of goat anti–
rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated IgG (Bio-Rad Laborato￾ries), and developed with 60 mL of horseradish peroxidase developer
(30 mg horseradish peroxidase developer powder [Bio-Rad Labora￾tories], 10 mL methanol, 50 mL Tris-buffered saline, and 50 mL of
30% hydrogen peroxide added just before use). 
Statistics
Analysis of variance was used to compare three or more conditions,
with post-hoc comparisons tested using Tukey’s procedure. Graft sur￾vival data was analyzed using contingency analysis with the chi￾square statistic. Paired comparison of serial measurements (human
CS and peripheral blood samples at the start and conclusion of car￾diac surgery) were compared using Student’s t-test for paired vari￾ables. Values are expressed as means6SEM, with a P , 0.05 consid￾ered statistically significant.
Results
Exposure of cultured ECs to hypoxia results in the release of
vWF and translocation of P-selectin to the cell surface. Previ￾ous studies have shown that exposure of ECs to hypoxia re￾sults in an elevation in intracellular calcium (28). In view of the
association of increased cytosolic calcium with EC WP exocy￾tosis in response to thrombin or histamine (29, 30), we consid￾ered whether exposure of ECs to hypoxia could initiate this
process. ECs placed in an hypoxic environment (pO2
 20 torr)
released more vWF into the culture supernatants than their
normoxic counterparts (Fig. 1 A, ELISA; confirmed by immu￾noelectrophoresis, data not shown). Although a trend towards
enhanced levels of vWF was first noted by 1 h of hypoxia, the
differences between normoxic and hypoxic vWF levels did not
become statistically significant until 4 h of exposure, increasing
steadily thereafter for up to 12 h of observation. To determine
whether the increased vWF release seen by 4 h of hypoxia was
due to release of preformed vWF, similar experiments were
performed in the presence of 10 mg/ml cycloheximide to in￾hibit protein synthesis. These experiments showed that addi￾tion of cycloheximide at the start of the hypoxic period de￾creased hypoxia-induced vWF release by 12.5%, suggesting
that the majority of vWF released by hypoxic exposure was
preformed.
Although these experiments were done in their entirety
within the hypoxic environment (i.e., there was no reoxygen￾ation), to further demonstrate that this hypoxia-mediated exo￾cytosis of WPs was independent of the formation of reactive
oxygen intermediates, the antioxidant probucol (50 mM) was
added to the ECs at the onset of hypoxia and was found to

have no effect (vWF 4.760.31 3 1023
 U/ml at 6 h of hypoxia).
The presence of probucol blunted the further increase in vWF
levels seen after reoxygenation of the hypoxic ECs (data not
shown). The calcium dependence of hypoxia-induced WP exo￾cytosis was demonstrated by experiments in which ECs were
placed in a calcium-free medium at the start of hypoxic expo￾sure. Absence of extracellular calcium attenuated hypoxia￾induced EC release of vWF, and addition of EGTA had an
even more suppressive effect (basal endothelial release of
vWF was also diminished by the reduction of extracellular cal￾cium) (Fig. 1 B).
To determine whether hypoxia also induced translocation
of P-selectin to the EC plasmalemmal surface, specific binding
of 125I-labeled anti–P-selectin IgG to normoxic or hypoxic EC
monolayers was examined. Binding studies were performed on
EC monolayers fixed with paraformaldehyde while still within
the hypoxic environment, to obviate oxygen-free radical–
induced P-selectin expression during reoxygenation. These
studies demonstrated enhanced binding of 125I–anti–P-selectin
IgG by hypoxic compared with normoxic ECs (Fig. 2 A). This
binding was blocked by unlabeled anti–P-selectin IgG (WAPS
12.2 clone). Surface expression of P-selectin was noted at the
earliest time points observed (60 min of hypoxia) and was ob￾served at similar levels throughout the period of hypoxic expo￾sure (up to 4 h of observation). It is possible that hypoxia￾induced endothelial P-selectin expression was detected at time
points preceding a statistically significant increase of vWF re￾lease in similarly treated cells, because a portion of the initially
secreted vWF binds tightly to subendothelial matrix (31).
To determine whether protein synthesis was required for
hypoxia-induced P-selectin expression, a separate experiment
was performed in which cycloheximide was given at the onset
of normoxia or hypoxia, and binding of radiolabeled anti–
P-selectin IgG determined at the 4-h time point. This experi￾ment demonstrated that even with . 85% inhibition of protein
synthesis (Fig. 2 B, inset), hypoxia still increased endothelial
P-selectin expression, albeit at reduced levels (Fig. 2 B). To es￾tablish that hypoxia-induced cell-surface P-selectin may par￾ticipate in neutrophil binding, human neutrophils radiolabeled
with 111In-oxine were incubated with hypoxic ECs; enhanced
binding to hypoxic monolayers was observed. Hypoxia￾induced 111In-PMN binding was blocked by the addition of a
blocking anti–P-selectin IgG, but not by a nonblocking anti–
P-selectin IgG of the same isotype (Fig. 2 C). 
Role of P-selectin–dependent neutrophil adhesion in hypo￾thermic/ischemic myocardial preservation. To establish the rel￾evance of these observations to hypothermic myocardial pres￾ervation (in which the pO2
 of the preservation solution within
the coronary vasculature drops below 20 torr [15]), hearts were
harvested from male Lewis rats and subjected to hypothermic

preservation as described in Methods. Because neutrophil￾mediated damage after cardiac ischemia is well established
(32–38), the potential pathophysiologic role of endothelial
P-selectin expression was investigated in an orthotopic rat
heart transplant model in which reperfusion occurred after a
period of hypothermic preservation. These experiments
showed excellent graft survival and little neutrophil infiltration
if heart transplantation was performed immediately after har￾vest (Fig. 3 A, Fresh). However, when similar experiments
were performed with an intervening (16-h) period of hypoth￾ermic preservation between the harvest and transplantation
procedures, there was a high incidence (90%) of graft failure
and marked leukostasis, confirmed histologically (not shown)
and by determining myeloperoxidase activity (Fig. 3 A, Prsvd).
To demonstrate that neutrophil adhesion was responsible, at
least in part, for graft failure after prolonged preservation,
transplants were performed after neutrophil depletion of re￾cipient rats. The polyclonal rabbit anti–rat PMN antibody that
we used (23–25) eliminated virtually all circulating PMNs in
the recipients (PMN count 1,471656 vs 67611 PMN/mm3
 for
control and immunodepleted animals, respectively, P ,
0.001), with little effect on other cell types. When 16-h pre￾served hearts were transplanted into neutrophil-depleted re￾cipients to provide a neutrophil-free reperfusion milieu, there
was a significant reduction in graft myeloperoxidase activity
and an increase in graft survival (Fig. 3 A, Prsvd (2) PMN).
Normal recipient rats infused with blocking anti–P-selectin
IgG (PB1.3) 10 min before reestablishment of blood flow dem￾onstrated a reduction of both myeloperoxidase activity as well
as improvement in graft survival (Fig. 3 A, a PS, Blocking) of a
similar magnitude as neutrophil-depleted recipients. This re￾duced PMN infiltration and improved graft survival was ob￾served despite 16 h of hypothermic preservation of the donor
heart. In sharp contrast, administration of a nonblocking con￾trol antibody (AC1.2) had no beneficial effect on graft leuko￾stasis or graft survival (Fig. 3 A, a-PS, Non-blocking).
Because in addition to the interactions between ECs and
PMNs, platelets may also interact with PMNs via a P-selectin–
dependent mechanism (39), we designed an experiment to iso￾late the contribution of endothelial P-selectin to the leukosta￾sis and graft failure that occur after prolonged hypothermic
cardiac preservation. For these experiments, donor hearts
from homozygous P-selectin–deficient mice could be flushed
free of blood, so that P-selectin–null coronary ECs could be
transplanted into wild-type recipients with P-selectin–contain￾ing platelets. Using a murine heterotopic heart transplant
model performed identically to the rat operation, donor hearts
were obtained from either homozygous P-selectin–null mice
(27) or wild-type controls; all hearts were transplanted into
wild-type recipients. These experiments demonstrated a signif￾icantly higher graft survival rate in the P-selectin–null → wild￾type transplants compared with wild-type → wild-type trans￾plants (Fig. 3 B). This improved graft survival in the former
group was paralleled by a marked (13-fold) reduction in graft
leukostasis (Fig. 3 B). Because these hearts had been flushed
free of blood at the start of preservation, these studies impli￾cate coronary endothelial (rather than platelet-derived) P-selec￾tin in the poor preservation and leukocyte arrest noted after
hypothermic myocardial preservation. 
WP exocytosis during human cardiac surgery. To establish
the relevance of these findings to humans, the next set of ex￾periments was designed to demonstrate that coronary ECs re￾lease the contents of WPs during hypothermic cardiac preser￾vation as occurs during routine cardiac surgery. Measurements
were made of vWF release from the coronary vasculature dur￾ing a well-defined period of cardiac ischemia, which occurs
during the period of aortic cross-clamping. CS blood was sam￾pled at the start (CS1) and conclusion (CS2) of aortic cross￾clamping in 32 patients (this interval represents the ischemic
period). These patients (23 male, 9 female) had a clinical his￾tory of valvular heart disease (n 5 11) or ischemic heart dis￾ease (n 5 21), and underwent either valve repair/replacement
or coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively. Capture ELI￾SAs performed for the integral membrane protein thrombo￾modulin (40) demonstrated no change in levels between the
CS1
 and the CS2
 samples (4.3561.2 ng/mL vs 3.4860.8 ng/mL,
P 5 NS), suggesting that ECs were not sloughed and cell mem￾Figure 3. Role of neutrophils and endothelial P-selectin in rodent

harvest (Fresh, n 5 8) or preserved for 16 h in LR at 4°C followed by 
transplantation (Prsvd, n 5 4). The effect of administering nonblock￾ing anti–P-selectin antibody (AC1.2, n 5 3), immunodepleting recipi￾ents of neutrophils before donor heart implantation (2 PMN, n 5 4), 
or administering 250 mg of blocking anti–P-selectin IgG (PB1.3, n 5 
4) 10 min before reperfusion on cardiac graft survival (shaded bars) 
and leukostasis (myeloperoxidase activity, solid bars). Means6SEM 
are shown. For graft survival, c vs a, P , 0.0001; g vs c, P , 0.05; i vs e
or c, P , 0.05. For graft neutrophil infiltration, d vs b, P , 0.01; h vs 
d, P , 0.05; j vs d or f, P , 0.05. (B) Role of coronary endothelial 
P-selectin in cardiac preservation, using donor hearts from P-selec￾tin–null (or wild-type control) mice that were flushed free of blood 
before preservation. (B, left) Graft survival was assessed by the pres￾ence/absence of cardiac electrical/mechanical activity exactly 10 min

(dABs 460 nm/min) as described (15, 18). (For bars shown from left 
to right, n 5 14, 8, 13, and 7, respectively, with P values indicated).

brane integrity was maintained during cardiac preservation.
Similar measurements performed for vWF showed that there
was a consistent and significant increase in vWF that is se￾creted during the course of cardiac preservation (0.6860.06 U/
ml vs 0.9060.05 U/ml, CS1
 vs CS2
, P , 0.01) (Fig. 4 A).
To demonstrate that this vWF was likely to be of coronary
endothelial rather than of platelet origin, and hence was not
simply a consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass, peripheral
blood samples were obtained simultaneously with the CS1
 and
CS2
 samples and showed that levels of vWF were unchanged
(0.81360.52 U/mL vs 0.90060.41 U/mL, P 5 NS), suggesting
that mechanical perturbation of platelets during cardiopulmo￾nary bypass was not causative. Because vWF is present in
plasma as multimers with a range of Mrs (41–44), with those
vWF multimers from the stimulatable pool (as opposed to
those constitutively secreted) being of the highest molecular
weight (45), immunoelectrophoresis was performed on the CS
samples. These gels demonstrated that, in addition to an over￾all increase in vWF in the CS2
 samples, there appeared to be
an increase in high molecular weight multimers, suggesting re￾lease from a stimulatable pool, as is found in ECs (Fig. 4 B).
Discussion
The vasculature plays a critical role in maintaining the extra￾cellular milieu of organs subjected to ischemia and reperfu￾sion, a role that is chiefly orchestrated by the ECs lining the
endovascular lumen. The EC responds to a period of oxygen
deprivation by striking phenotypic modulation, becoming pro￾thrombotic (46) and proinflammatory (1, 4, 6). ECs exposed to
hypoxia secrete the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 (4) and
IL-8 (6), which may serve to direct leukocyte traffic to areas of
ischemia. Because these processes require de novo protein
synthesis, they do not explain the immediate events that occur
after a period of hypothermic preservation. Whereas enhanced
expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and induction
of E-selectin may contribute at later times to leukocyte arrest
in cardiac grafts, this does not explain the rapid leukostasis ob￾served after cold preservation, in which protein synthesis is
likely to be considerably slowed. In this context, cycloheximide
pretreatment does not alter the early (90–120-min) PMN ad￾hesion seen after hypoxic exposure of ECs (7), suggesting that
de novo protein synthesis need not be involved in hypoxia￾mediated increases in PMN binding. Although PAF may par￾ticipate in hypoxia-mediated PMN adhesion (7, 47) and activa￾tion (48, 49), PAF is not stored and must be synthesized, which
may lessen its importance during the hypothermic period dur￾ing myocardial preservation. It is for this reason that rapid EC
expression of preformed P-selectin from subplasmalemmal
storage sites in WPs (9, 50, 51) may represent the most impor￾tant mechanism for early PMN recruitment after hypothermic
preservation. WPs are found in abundance within the coronary
microvasculature (52), suggesting their particular importance
in cardiac preservation.
Our data show WP exocytosis occurs in response to hy￾poxia per se as well as in human hearts during hypothermic
preservation. Whereas it is difficult to identify precisely an en￾dothelial origin for the vWF observed in the human CS sam￾ples, studies of platelets after cardiopulmonary bypass demon￾strate no increase in surface P-selectin expression or a-granule
secretion (53, 54). This suggests that the observed increase in
CS vWF after aortic cross-clamping is not of platelet origin.
Two aspects of our data also suggest that the vWF released af￾ter ischemia is of endothelial origin: (a) Peripheral vWF levels
remained unchanged whereas CS levels are increased after
myocardial ischemia, suggesting that the elevated vWF was
emanating from the heart rather than from the cardiopulmo￾nary bypass apparatus; and (b) the transgenic, P-selectin–null
donor hearts were flushed free of donor blood at the onset of
preservation, so that when transplanted into wild-type recipi￾ents, presumably coronary endothelial (not platelet) P-selectin
is absent. These experiments demonstrate the important con￾tribution of endothelial P-selectin to the neutrophil recruit￾ment that accompanies reperfusion.
It is not surprising that P-selectin should be important after
hypothermic myocardial preservation; recent studies have
demonstrated that P-selectin is an important mediator of neu￾trophil-induced reperfusion damage after normothermic is￾chemia, as has been shown in rabbit ear (26) and feline cardiac
ischemia (14) models. Because oxidants cause expression of
P-selectin at the EC surface (10), it was important in our stud￾ies to evaluate the role of the hypoxic period alone, as it may
prime ECs to recruit the first wave of PMNs, with further
PMN recruitment amplified with the onslaught of reactive ox￾ygen intermediates produced in the reperfusion microenvi￾ronment. Although one previous report has suggested that
hypoxia might induce EC P-selectin expression, these experi￾ments (7) were actually performed after reoxygenation, a con￾dition known to induce both superoxide (18, 55) and neutro￾phil adherence to cultured ECs (56). Our experiments were
performed entirely within a hypoxic environment to prevent
completely the possibility of reoxygenation, and antioxidants

Hypoxia/Ischemia-induced Weibel-Palade Body Exocytosis 499
failed to block hypoxia-induced P-selectin expression, suggest￾ing that our observations reflect hypoxia per se rather than re￾oxygenation. Furthermore, the cardiac protection we have
demonstrated using a strategy whereby blood-free preserved
hearts from transgenic P-selectin–null mice are transplanted
into recipients with wild-type platelets demonstrates that en￾dothelial P-selectin expression can be deleterious after hypoth￾ermic cardiac preservation. Because WP exocytosis occurs
during hypothermic cardiac preservation in humans, these
studies suggest that myocardial preservation may be enhanced
by therapeutic strategies designed to block the activity of P-se￾lectin expressed at the endothelial surface.
