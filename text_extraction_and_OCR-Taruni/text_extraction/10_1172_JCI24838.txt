Progression of pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased proliferation and migration of pulmo￾nary vascular smooth muscle cells. PDGF is a potent mitogen and involved in this process. We now reportthat
the PDGF receptor antagonist STI571 (imatinib) reversed advanced pulmonary vascular disease in 2 animal
models of pulmonary hypertension. In rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension, therapy
with daily administration of STI571 was started 28 days after induction of the disease. A 2-week treatment
resulted in 100% survival, compared with only 50% in sham-treated rats. The changes inRVpressure, measured
continuously by telemetry, and right heart hypertrophy were reversed to near-normal levels. STI571 prevented
phosphorylation ofthe PDGF receptor and suppressed activation of downstream signaling pathways. Similar
results were obtained in chronically hypoxic mice, which were treated with STI571 after full establishment of
pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, expression ofthe PDGF receptor was found to be significantly increased
in lung tissue from pulmonary arterial hypertension patients compared with healthy donor lung tissue. We
conclude that STI571 reverses vascular remodeling and cor pulmonale in severe experimental pulmonary
hypertension regardless of the initiating stimulus. This regimen offers a unique novel approach for antire￾modeling therapy in progressed pulmonary hypertension.
Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a life-threat￾ening disease characterized by a marked and sustained elevation
of pulmonary artery pressure. The disease results in RV failure
and death (1). Current therapeutic approaches for the treatment
of chronic pulmonary hypertension mainly provide symptomatic
relief, as well assome improvement of prognosis. Although postu￾lated for all treatments, evidence for direct antiproliferative effects
of most approaches is missing (2–4). In addition, the use of most
of the currently applied agents is hampered by either undesired
side effects orinconvenient drug administration routes. Pathologi￾cal changesin hypertensive pulmonary arteriesinclude endothelial
injury, proliferation, and hypercontraction of vascular SMCs (5).
Several growth factors have been implicated in the abnormal
proliferation and migration of SMCs, including PDGF, basic
FGF (bFGF), and EGF (6–10). In vitro studies established that
PDGF acts as a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for SMCs
(10). Active PDGF is built up by polypeptides (A and B chain) that
form homo- or heterodimers and stimulate α and β cell surface
receptors (11). Recently, 2 additional PDGF genes were identified,
encoding PDGF-C and PDGF-D polypeptides(12–14). The PDGF
receptors (PDGFRs) belong to a family of transmembrane recep￾tor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and are supposed to be held together
by the bivalent PDGF ligands. This complex of dimeric receptor
and PDGF results in an autophosphorylation of the RTK and an
increase in kinase activity.
Both receptors activate the major signaling transduction path￾ways, including Ras/MAPK, PI3K, and phospholipase Cγ (11, 15,
16).Recently, upregulation of both PDGFRαand PDGFRβ has been
shown in lambs with chronic intrauterine pulmonary hypertension
(9). Pulmonary PDGF-A or PDGF-B mRNA, however, did not dif￾fer between pulmonary hypertensive and control animals. In lung
biopsiesfrom patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH), PDGF-A chain expression wassignificantly increased (17).
STI571 (imatinib or Gleevec) was designed to target the ATP￾binding site of tyrosine kinases and is a well-established inhibi￾tor of the kinase BCR-ABL; the receptor for the stem cell factor,
c-KIT; and the PDGFR with IC50 values in the range of 0.1 µM
(18). Currently, this substance is approved for the treatment
of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (19) and progressed
malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (20). According to
our current hypothesis, altered PDGF signaling might also play
an important role in the course of PAH. Thus, we investigated
the effects of STI571 on hemodynamics and pulmonary vascular
remodeling in an established model of experimental pulmonary
hypertension. In addition, downstream effects on the cellular and
molecular level were analyzed to provide mechanistic explanation
of STI571-induced changes.
Results
Effects of STI571 on hemodynamics and gas exchange. The rats chal￾lenged with monocrotaline (MCT) developed severe pulmonary
hypertension within 28 days, which was sustained (if the animals
survived) until day 42. Consequently, RV systolic pressure (RVSP)
was increased significantly as compared with the saline-challenged
group (Figure 1A). STI571 was applied by daily i.p. injections from
day 28 to 42 and reversed chronic pulmonary hypertension to
near-normal levels in the 50 mg/kg/d group (Figure 1, A and B).
Telemetric measurement of RVSP showed that severe pulmonary

hypertension was established after 28 days and that STI571 nearly
normalized pulmonary pressure at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d (Figure
1B). Mean systemic arterial pressure did not change in any of the
treatment groups (Figure 1C). As compared with control animals
(36.0 ± 1.4 ml/min per 100 g body weight), cardiac index was
decreased in the MCT group at days 28 (28.0 ± 2.4 ml/min per 100
g body weight) and 42 (26.0 ± 2.7 ml/min 100 g per body weight;
P < 0.05).In the STI571-treated animals(50 mg/kg/d), cardiac index
increased significantly as comparedwith sham treatment(37.6 ± 5.4
ml/min 100 g body weight; P < 0.05) (Figure 1D). Similar results
were observed for arterial oxygenation, which decreased in MCT￾challenged animals and significantly increased under treatment
with STI571 at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg/d (Figure 1E).
In chronically hypoxic mice, severe pulmonary hypertension
developed within 21 days, which was characterized by a significant
increase in RVSP as compared with normoxic animals(Figure 1F).
RVSP increased further until day 35 and was nearly normalized in
the 100 mg ST571/kg/d group.

quence of increased pulmonary pressures. The ratio of RV weight to
LV plus septum weight (RV/LV+S) increased from 0.30 ± 0.02 (con￾trols) to 0.71 ± 0.03 (28 days after MCT challenge) and 0.78 ± 0.07
(42 days afterMCTchallenge)(both P < 0.05 versus controls). STI571
caused a dose-dependentreduction ofthisratio to 0.71 ± 0.03 (1 mg/
kg/d), 0.62 ± 0.03 (10 mg/kg/d; P < 0.05 versus MCT), and 0.42 ± 0.03
(50 mg/kg/d; P < 0.05 versus MCT) (Figure 2A).
In the untreated MCT group,survival rate at day 42 wasreduced
to 50% (10 of 20 animals survived) (Figure 2B). STI571 treatment
improved the survival rate to 65% (13 of 20) in the 1 mg/kg day
group, 83.3% (15 of 18) in the 10 mg/kg/d group, and 100% (18 of
18) in the 50 mg/kg/d group.
The RV/LV+S ratio in hypoxic mice increased from 0.25 ± 0.02
(controls) to 0.38 ± 0.02 (21-day hypoxia) and 0.43 ± 0.02 (35-day
hypoxia) (both P < 0.05 versus controls) (Figure 2C). In the 100
mg/kg/d treatment group, this ratio was decreased to 0.30 ± 0.03
(P < 0.01 versus hypoxia).
Antiremodeling potency of STI571 in pulmonary vasculature. We quan￾titatively assessed the degree of muscularization of pulmonary
arteries with a diameter between 25 and 50 µm. In controls, the
majority of vessels of this diameter were usually nonmuscularized,
as shown exemplarily in Figure 3A. In the MCT-injected animals,
both at day 28 and day 42, a dramatic decrease in nonmuscular￾ized pulmonary arteries occurred (Figure 4A) with a concomitant
increase in fully muscularized pulmonary arteries(Figures 3B and
4A). Treatmentwith STI571 at 50 mg/kg/d resulted in a significant
reduction in fully muscularized arteries as compared with both
MCT groups and increased the percentage of nonmuscularized
pulmonary arteries (Figures 3C and 4A). Medial wall thickness of
pulmonary arteries 25–50 µm in diameter was markedly increased
in the MCT groups, both at day 28 (28.74% ± 0.33%; P < 0.05 versus
control) and day 42 (36.83% ± 0.54%; P < 0.05 versus control), as
compared with control animals (18.59% ± 0.42%) (Figure 3, D–F,
and Figure 4B). Compared with both MCT groups, STI571 at 50
mg/kg/d significantly reversed the increase in medial wall thick￾ness to 22.66% ± 0.23% (P < 0.05 versus MCT).
Medial wall thickness of pulmonary arteries sized between 51
and 100 µm and more than 100 µm in diameter was determined
separately. In both categories, STI571 nearly normalized medial
wall thickness values (Figure 4, C and D). Lumen area (given in
micrometers2) of pulmonary arteries 25–50 µm in diameter
decreased from 1,220 µm2 to 1,075 µm2 in the MCT 28-day group
and to 791 µm2 in the MCT 42-day group (Figure 4E). Treatment
with STI571 at 50 mg/kg/d resulted in a normalization of internal
lumen area (1,195 µm2; P < 0.05 versus MCT).
In hypoxic animals, both at day 21 and day 35, a significant
decrease in nonmuscularized pulmonary arteries occurred, with
a concomitant increase in fully muscularized pulmonary arteries
(Figure 4F). Treatment with 100 mg/kg/d STI571 resulted in a sig￾nificant reduction in partially muscularized arteries as compared
with both hypoxia groups (21 days, i.e., before the start of STI571
treatment, and 35 days) and increased significantly the percentage
of nonmuscularized pulmonary arteries.
Effects of STI571 on MMP activity. The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9
protein were markedly increased in lung homogenates of MCT￾challenged rats when compared with controls. This increase was
normalized by STI571 treatment (Figure 5A). Zymographic meas￾urement of MMP revealed highly elevated activity in MCT-chal￾lenged animals, with most prominent effects observed for MMP-2
(Figure 5B). Protein content of MMP-2 as well as activity were nor￾malized in the STI571-treated animals (50 mg/kg/d).
Effects of STI571 on PDGF-B and PDGFR expression and phosphoryla￾tion. In MCT-treated animals, a marked increase in PDGF-B pro￾tein was detected (by immunohistochemistry) in the medial layer
of small pulmonary arteries, while control lungs were completely
negative (Figure 3, G and H). As compared with MCT-challenged

rats, the STI571-treated animals displayed lower PDGF-B expres￾sion in the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 3I). PDGFRβ protein
and its phosphorylated (activated) form were highly upregulated
in MCT-challenged rats (Figure 6) and mice (Figure 7). Similar
results were obtained for the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rats
(Figure 8). In contrast, expression and phosphorylation of both
PDGFR and ERK1/2 were strongly suppressed by treatment with
50 mg/kg/d STI571 in rats (Figures 6 and 8), and phosphoryla￾tion of the PDGFR was reduced in hypoxic mice treated with 100
mg/kg/d STI571 (Figure 7).
Expression of PDGFRβ in lungs from patients with PAH. Western blot
analysis revealed a significant increase in protein expression of

STI571 inhibits pulmonary SMC proliferation in vitro. Rat pulmonary
artery SMC (PA-SMC) proliferation, induced by 10% FBS/DMEM,
wasinhibited by STI571 in a dose-dependent manner(0.1, 1, and 5
µM), as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (Figure
10A). In addition, STI571 increased the apoptosis of PA-SMCs in
the presence of 10% serum in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
10B). In order to determine the selectivity of STI571 on PDGF￾induced SMC proliferation, different growth factors (PDGF-AA,
PDGF-BB, IGF-1, EGF, or bFGF) were employed to stimulate rat

pulmonary SMCs. STI571 was added to the culture medium at 1
µM 2 hours before the addition of each growth factor. STI571 dem￾onstrated a significant inhibition of PDGF-AA– and PDGF-BB–
induced proliferation, while, in contrast, proliferation stimulated
by IGF-1, EGF, or bFGF was unaffected (Figure 10C).
Effect of STI571 on PA-SMC proliferation and apoptosis. In MCT￾challenged rats, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labe￾ling showed proliferation of SMCs in distal pulmonary arteries
as compared with controls (Figure 11A). In parallel to normali￾zation of vessel morphology, the number of PCNA-positive
cells was considerably reduced in animals treated with STI571.
Virtually no apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay in pul￾monary resistance vessels of control and MCT-challenged ani￾mals. However, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis was
considerably increased in pulmonary arterial vessel walls in the
STI571 group (Figure 11B).
Discussion
The novel finding of the presentstudy isthat the PDGFR antago￾nist STI571 is an effective treatment in 2 well-established experi￾mental models of severe pulmonary hypertension. Treatment
effects showed dose dependency and included (a) reversal of pul￾monary hypertension, (b) reduction in right heart hypertrophy
and improvement in cardiac output, (c) reversal of pulmonary
vessel proliferation, and (d) an impressive survival benefit in
MCT rats. Moreover, the importance of PDGF signaling in the
course of pulmonary hypertension was proven by a significant
inhibition of PDGF-associated signaling pathways by STI571.
Recently, newtherapeutic approaches have been proposed forthe
treatment of chronic pulmonary hypertension in affected patients.
These include endothelin receptor antagonists (4), nonparenteral
prostanoids (21), and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (22–25).
However, all of these approaches address pulmonary vasodilation
as the main therapeutic target; although postulated, there is little
proof (either experimental or clinical) that any of these drugs has
a direct antiproliferative effect or even the potency to reverse pro￾liferative changes in the pulmonary circulation.
PDGFR signaling–related cellular proliferation has been suggest￾ed as an important contributor to the development and progres￾Figure 6

sion of pulmonary hypertension (9, 17, 26, 27). A recently published
study investigated the effects of a truncated soluble PDGFRβ in
the development of hyperoxia-induced vascular changes and found
reduced SMC proliferation (28). In addition, Balasubramaniam et
al. prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the
ovine fetus employing an aptamerthatselectively inhibits PDGF-B
(9). However, up to now, no interventional data have been available
describing the therapeutic use of the specific PDGFR antagonist
STI571 in experimental or clinical pulmonary hypertension. In our
current study, we found a most prominent reversal of pulmonary
hypertension in response to STI571 therapy. Treatment did not
affectsystemic arterial pressure, proving selectivity ofthis approach
forthe abnormal pulmonary circulation and providing evidence for
the absence of noteworthy vasodilatory effects. In patients suffer￾ing from severe pulmonary hypertension, inadequate adaptation
of cardiac output representsthe main limitation for normal physi￾cal activities. In addition, an insufficient increase in systemic arte￾rial pressure under conditions of exercise is a negative predictor of
survival for patients with severe PAH (29). In advanced stages of
right heartload,systemic arterial pressure is already reduced atrest.
Thus, agents affecting systemic blood pressure,such as nonselective
vasodilators — though lowering pulmonary pressures to a certain
extent — provoke undesirable systemic hypotension. In view of this
clinically relevant aspect, antiproliferative agents such as STI571,
which completely lack acute vasodilative potential, represent what
we believe to be an entirely novel approach for the treatment of
chronic vascular diseases.
As a consequence of reduced right heart load, muscular cardiac
hypertrophy was reverted to near normal levels in a dose-depend￾ent manner in both MCT-treated rats and chronically hypoxic
mice. Taken together with the improved survival, these data are
strongly suggestive for a curative potential of PDGFR inhibition in
severe pulmonary hypertension regardless of the initiating event.
Although treatment efficacy has also been shown to a certain
extent for serine elastase inhibitors (30), simvastatin (31), fasudil
(a Rho-kinase inhibitor) (32), or phosphodiesterase inhibitors(33,
34), the overall treatment efficacy (including hemodynamics,right
heart hypertrophy, vascular remodeling, and survival, as currently
presented) has not been shown before.
Upon treatment with STI571, the proportion of non- to fully
muscularized vessels dramatically increased in MCT- and hypoxia￾induced pulmonary hypertension. Structural changes observed in
MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension strongly resemble charac￾teristics of human PAH in terms of (a) marked medial wallthicken￾ing, (b) intimal proliferation, and (c) plexiform lesion formation,
all resulting in a dramatic loss of resistance vessel capacity (35). As
a consequence, hemodynamics and remodeling of the right heart
in chronically affected animals at late stages of the disease mimic
well the situation found in patients (36, 37). In addition, hypoxia
is the main stimulus for the induction of pulmonary hyperten￾sion accompanying chronic ventilatory disorders such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease. While
acute hypoxia causes selective pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstric￾tion, chronic exposure to hypoxia results in morphological and
functional changesin the pulmonary vascular bed (24, 25, 38, 39).
Hypoxia may also be an activator of the PDGF-related pathway, as
previously shown in HT1080 cells (40).
In the currentstudy, we found a marked increase in cell prolifera￾tion (assessed by PCNA staining) in pulmonary resistance vessels of
MCT-challenged animals. Interestingly, considerable apoptosiswas
found neither in control animals nor in those with MCT-induced
pulmonary hypertension. However, STI571 treatment resulted in
near normal vessel morphology, reduced proliferation rate, and,

most interestingly, an increased apoptosis rate in the vessel wall.
Thisis well in line with previousfindingsin which antiproliferative
properties of STI571 were attributed to an increased apoptosisrate
in balloon-injured vessels of hypercholesterolemic rabbits (41). In
this context, PDGF is known to be a potent inhibitor of apoptosis,
thereby promoting proliferation in several tissues (42, 43) predo￾minantly via the PI3K/Akt pathway (44, 45). Thus, inhibition of
proliferation by STI571 can in part be explained by suppression of
the antiapoptotic properties of PDGF signaling. Moreover, recent
reports indicate both c-ABL–dependent and –independent induc￾tion of apoptosis by STI571 via the activation of caspases (46, 47).
Increase in MMP expression and activity has been shown to cor￾relate with the severity of disease in various experimental forms of
pulmonary hypertension (33, 34, 38). MMP-9 is strongly induced
by ERK activities, which are known to be involved in downstream
signaling of PDGFR activation (48). Furthermore, in vitro stud￾Figure 10

ies provided evidence for direct MMP-1 and MMP-3 induction by
PDGF-A (49) and PDGF-B (50), respectively. Moreover, reduction
in MMP-2 levels parallels hemodynamic and structural changes
upon onset of effective therapy (34). The present finding that
STI571 strongly reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and
activity is thus well in line with the beneficial effect of this agent
on MCT-induced structural and hemodynamic changes.
Direct evidence for an involvement ofthe PDGFR signaling path￾way in the development of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension
and in the therapeutic effects of STI571 was derived from the fol￾lowing findings: (a) PDGFRβ expression was strongly upregulated
in the MCT-challenged rat lungs — this is well in line with previ￾ous data that have shown that PDGFRβ mRNA was significantly
increased in the pulmonary artery of MCT-treated rats (9, 27); (b)
this increased expression was reversed with STI571 treatment, in
parallel to the beneficial effects on hemodynamics, morphology,
and survival; (c) PDGFRβ phosphorylation was increased in MCT￾challenged animals but reduced in response to STI571 treatment;
and (d) induction of downstream signaling of the PDGFR pathway
was indicated by activation (MCT alone) and suppression (MCT
plus STI571) of ERK1/2. ERK phosphorylation has been shown
to be a key downstream signal for PDGFR stimulation (51, 52),
and its strong suppression under STI571 supports the notion that
this agent is operative via the PDGFR system (Figure 12). It is well
known that, besidesthe PDGFR, STI571 is also blocking ABL tyro￾sine kinases and c-kit with identical IC50 values of 100 nM. BCL￾ABL transformation isspecifically described for CML and does not
play a role in nonmalignant pulmonary diseases. Little is known
about the role of c-kit–positive bone marrow–derived hematopoi￾etic stem cells in pulmonary diseases. If at all, a single report exists
that shows some beneficial potential of these cells in a lung injury
model (53). Thus, interaction with this pathway is highly unlike￾ly to be involved in the currently described study. Therefore, the
PDGF-inhibitory capacity of STI571 is mostlikely the predominant
mode of action involved in the beneficialtherapeutic effectsin both
PAH models. Further evidence for the selectivity of STI571 for the
PDGFRwas obtained from cell culture experimentsinwhich differ￾ent growth factors (PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, IGF-1, EGF, and bFGF)
were employed to stimulate pulmonary arterial SMC growth. Simi￾larresults have previously been shown for proliferating rat coronary
SMCs demonstrating that an investigational PDGFR antagonist
that is clinically not applicable (CGP 57148B) selectively blocked
PDGF-AA– or PDGF-BB–induced proliferation (54).
Furthermore, we believe that PDGFR upregulation and activa￾tion of the consecutive signaling pathway (PDGFR phosphor￾ylation/ERK) represent a self-perpetuating vicious circle, which,
regardless of the primary inducer(MCT or hypoxia), via loss of ves￾sel potency and increased shearstressresultsin further pulmonary
vascular remodeling. It is well known that shear stress is a strong
stimulus for PDGF and PDGFR expression in vascular cells (27,
55, 56). Once downstream signaling of the PDGFR is inhibited by
STI571 and thereby vascular remodeling is reversed (as shown in
our experiments), this vicious circle is interrupted, and PDGFR is
consecutively downregulated.
Ourstudy isthe first to our knowledge to describe the successful
therapeutic use of the PDGFR inhibitor STI571 in 2 well-accepted
animal models of pulmonary hypertension. We demonstrate that
treatment with STI571 not only reversed hemodynamic and struc￾tural changes provoked by MCT but also impressively improved
survival of the rats in the MCT rat model. Furthermore, evidence
for the involvement of the PDGFR system in disease development
and response to therapy was provided on the cellular and molecu￾lar level. Taking into account the limitations of experimentalstud￾ies, we still believe that our findings will be stimulating for con￾sideration of this novel therapeutic approach in patients suffering
from life-threatening advanced pulmonary hypertension, in which
PDGFRβ may be strongly upregulated, assuggested by the findings
in the currently investigated PAH patients. As STI571 is already
broadly used as an anti-cancer drug and proved to be well tolerated
in these indications, the clinical development as a new therapy for
pulmonary hypertension might therefore be imminent.
Methods
Experimental design. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g in body
weight; Charles River Laboratories) were randomized for treatment 28
days after a s.c. injection of saline or 60 mg/kg MCT (Sigma-Aldrich) to
induce pulmonary hypertension. In addition to a group of untreated rats,
the experimental groups included rats that received once-daily i.p. injec￾tion of STI571 (imatinib; gift from S. Pascoe and E. Buchdunger, Novar￾tis, Novartis Horsham Research Centre, Horsham, United Kingdom) at
a dose of 50 mg/kg or the administration vehicle (isotonic saline). Rats
were examined after 14 days of treatment (on day 42). STI571 is a low￾molecular-weight inhibitor of the protein tyrosine kinase activity of both
PDGFR subtypes (57, 58). STI571 was chosen to target the PDGF signal￾ing in MCT-induced vascular disease, and the dose was calculated based
on published studies (59).
Hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling was induced by exposure of
mice (8-week-old C57BL/6) to chronic hypoxia (10% O2) in a ventilated
chamber, as described previously (39). The chronic effects of STI571 were
assessed in mice exposed to hypoxia for 35 days. Briefly, 20 animals were
kept in hypoxic conditions to develop pulmonary hypertension. After 21
days, animals were randomized to receive either oral STI571 (50 and 100
mg/kg/d) or placebo via gavage.
All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the
University Giessen.

Surgical preparation and tissue preparation. For monitoring hemodynamics,
the animals were initially anesthetized i.p. with ketamine and xylazine. The
left carotid artery was cannulated, and a right heart catheter was inserted
through the right jugular vein for measurement of RV pressure with fluid￾filled force transducers. Cardiac output in rats was measured by thermodi￾lution technique (Cardiotherm 500-X; Hugo-Sachs Electronic — Harvard
Apparatus GmbH) as described previously (33, 34). After exsanguination,
the left lung was fixed for histology in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and
the right lung was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Telemetric measurement of RV pressure. RV pressure in rats was measured
with an implanted radiotelemetry system (Dataquest A.R.T. 2.1; Data Sci￾ences Inc.). The transmitter (model TA11PA) is connected to a fluid-filled
sensing catheter and transfersthe signalsto a remote receiver(modelRPC-1)
and a data-exchange matrix connected to a computer. Under anesthesia,
the sensing catheter was inserted into the jugular vein and forwarded to
the RV. The waveform was displayed on the computer and used to ensure
correct positioning of the catheter. Animals were allowed to recover and
were housed individually in standard rat cages. RV pressure was recorded
at 1-hour intervals from the time of implantation.
Assessment of RV hypertrophy. The RV wall was separated from the LV wall
and ventricular septum. Wet weight of the RV, free LV wall, and ventricular
septum was determined.RV hypertrophywas expressed asthe ratio ofweight
of the RV wall and that of the free LV wall and ventricularseptum (LV+S).
Patient characteristics and measurements. Human lung tissue was obtained
from 4 donors and 4 PAH patients (2 with IPAH, 1 with connective tissue
disease–associated PAH, 1 with congenital heart disease) undergoing lung
transplantation. Lung tissue was snap-frozen directly after explantation
for mRNA and protein extraction. The study protocol for tissue donation
was approved by the Ethk-Kommission am Fachbereich Humanmedizin
der Justus-Liebig-Universitaet Giessen of the University Hospital Giessen
(Giessen, Germany) in accordance with national law and with Good Clini￾cal Practice/International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. Writ￾ten informed consent was obtained from each individual patient or the
patient’s next of kin.
Paraffin embedding and microscopy. Fixation was performed by immersion
of the lungs in a 3% paraformaldehyde solution. For paraffin embedding,
the entire lungs were dissected in tissue blocks from all lobes. Section￾ing at 3 µm was performed from all paraffin-embedded blocks. H&E and
elastica staining was performed according to common histopathological
procedures. Analysis was done in a blinded fashion. To assess the type
of remodeling of muscular pulmonary arteries, microscopic images were
analyzed using a computerized morphometric system (QWin; Leica). In
each rat, 60 to 80 intraacinar arteries were categorized as muscular (i.e.,
with a complete medial coat of muscle), partially muscular (i.e., with only
a crescent of muscle), or nonmuscular (i.e., no apparent muscle), as previ￾ously reported (34). Lumen area was defined as the area within the lamina
elastica interna, counted and averaged from 800 representative vessels
within a range of diameters from 25 to 50 µm. Medial area is the area
between the lamina elastica interna and the lamina elastica externa. Arter￾ies were additionally categorized according to their external diameter. Cat￾egory I included arteries with an external diameter between 20 and 50
µm; category II included arteries with an external diameter between 51
and 100 µm; and category III included arteries with an external diameter
greater than 101 µm. In mouse sections, 60–80 intraacinar vessels at a size
between 20 and 70 µm accompanying either alveolar ducts or alveoli were
analyzed by an observer blinded to treatment in each mouse. As described
above, each vessel was categorized as nonmuscularized, partially muscu￾larized, or fully muscularized.
Gelatin zymography. Lung tissues were homogenized at 4°C in buffer con￾taining 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 µM E-64, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
with 20 mg ml–1 ratio of tissue weight by buffer volume. Activity of MMPs
was analyzed by SDS-PAGE zymography, in which the enzymes hydro￾lyze gelatin substrate present in the gel and form a clear band. Gels were
visualized with a Biodoc analyzer (Biometra), where activity of MMP-2
and MMP-9 wasshown as a clear white band against the blue background,
as previously described (34).
Western blotting. Lung tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Tri￾ton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, sodium
pyrophosphate, 100 µM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics Corp.). Lysates were normalized and separated on 7.5% or
10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. After
blocking, the membranes were probed with 1 of the following antibod￾ies: anti-PDGFRβ (sc432), anti-phospho (Tyr1021)-PDGFRβ (sc12909-R),
anti-ERK1/2 (sc93), and anti-phospho (Thr202/Tyr204/Thr185/Tyr 187)-
ERK1/2 (sc16982-R) antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.),
anti-MMP2, anti-MMP9, or anti-GAPDH loading control (all from Abcam
Ltd.), followed by a 1 hourincubation with secondary antibodies conjugat￾ed with HRP. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence with
the use of an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and quanti￾fied by densitometry.
Evaluation of in situ PA-SMC death and proliferation. To assess PA-SMC
proliferation in rats treated with MCT alone or with STI571, PCNA was
evaluated. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, then treated with
a graded series of alcohol washes, rehydrated in PBS (pH 7.5), and incu￾bated with antigen retrieval solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in a water
bath at 90°C for 20 minutes. Slides were then washed in PBS, incubated
for 1 hour in a protein-blocking solution, and incubated overnight with
anti-PCNA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.).
Antibodies were washed off and incubated with Alexa 555–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG antibodies(Invitrogen Corp.). Afterincubation, allsections
were counterstained with nuclear DAPI staining and mounted with Dako
fluorescent mounting media (all from DakoCytomation).
To assess PA-SMC apoptosis, sections were visualized using the ter￾minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated (TdT-mediated) TUNEL
method with the help of In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diag￾nostics Corp.) as specified by the manufacturer. At the end of the pro￾cedure, the slides were observed by fluorescence microscopy after DAPI
staining (DakoCytomation).
Proliferation assay. Primary rat SMCs were isolated, as previously described
(60), and cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2/95 %
O2 atmosphere. For assessment of proliferation, pulmonary rat SMCsfrom
passage 2 were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in
10% FBS/DMEM. Cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum￾free DMEM for 2 hours, followed by serum deprivation (DMEM contain￾ing 0.1% FBS) for 72 hours. Subsequently, they were stimulated with 10%
FBS/DMEM to induce cell cycle reentry. After treatment with 0, 0.1, 1,
and 5 µM STI571 during the last 12 hours and throughout the stimu￾lation period, the cells were pulsed with 1.5 µCi per well [3H]thymidine
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd.) during the last 12 hours of stimula￾tion. The [3H]thymidine content of cell lysates was determined by scintil￾lation counting and normalized by protein concentration, which was mea￾sured by the Lowry method (61). To investigate the specificity of STI571 on
PDGF-related proliferation, quiescent cells were stimulated with recombi￾nant PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB (60 ng/ml in serum-free medium), IGF-1 (100
ng/ml), EGF (50 ng/ml), and bFGF (50 ng/ml). All growth factors were
purchased from Upstate.
Apoptosis assay. The isolated PA-SMCs were grown on chamberslides and
treated as indicated (0.1, 1, and 5 µM STI571). After 24 hours, cells were

fixed immediately in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde for 1 hour, permea￾bilized using Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and then incubated at 37°C
for 60 minutes with TdT-mediated TUNEL reaction mixture (In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein; Roche Diagnostics Corp.). For positive
control, cells were treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) asspeci￾fied by the manufacturer.
Data analysis.All data are given as mean ± SEM.Differences between groups
