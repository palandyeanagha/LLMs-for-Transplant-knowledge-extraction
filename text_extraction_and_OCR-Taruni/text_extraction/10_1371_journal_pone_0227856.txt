Abstract
Despite the significant progress in characterizing mechanical functions of individual scleral
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, the biomechanical contribution of sulfated glycos￾aminoglycans (sGAGs) is still poorly understood. The primary purpose of this study was to
determine the possible function of sGAGs in scleral mechanical response by characterizing
the tensile behavior of normal and sGAG-depleted samples. We used chondroitinase ABC
solution to remove sGAGs from scleral samples that were dissected from posterior porcine
eyes. We performed biochemical analyses for assessing the efficacy of sGAG removal pro￾tocol. Furthermore, we conducted stress-controlled uniaxial tensile tests to characterize the
influence of sGAG removal on mechanical properties of sclera. The tensile behavior of
scleral strips right after dissection and after being soaked in buffer was also determined. Bio￾chemical analyses confirmed that 18 hour incubation in 0.125 U/ml Chondroitinase ABC
solution removed over 90% of chondroitin and dermatan sGAGs. No significant difference
was observed in the thickness/hydration of samples because of enzyme- and buffer-treated
samples. Furthermore, it was found that sGAG depletion did not significantly alter the tan￾gent modulus, energy dissipation, and peak strain of posterior scleral strips. It was con￾cluded that sGAGs did not influence the stress-controlled viscoelastic tensile response of
sclera.
1. Introduction
The sclera is a dense and opaque connective tissue that makes up the outer surface of the eye￾ball and defines its size and approximate spherical shape. In addition to preventing internal
light scattering, necessary for proper vision, the sclera has important role in protecting inner
parts of the eye against external insults. For example, it provides the required stability during
eye movement caused by extraocular muscles. Furthermore, unique mechanical properties of
sclera prevent significant variations in the shape of ocular globe because of intraocular pres￾sure changes. The biomechanical properties of sclera originate from its specific extracellular
matrix (ECM).

The sclera ECM is a complex mixture of primarily collagen fibrils, proteoglycans (PGs),
and elastin. Each of these components has a significant contribution to the physiological func￾tion of the sclera [1]. The collagen and elastin fibers, constituting the majority of the sclera dry
weight, were proven to be the primary loading-bearing components. However, the structural
roles of PGs and their sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) side chains have been less studied.
PGs were shown to be essential in regulating the movement of various molecules through the
ECM [2]. The most abundant sGAGs in the sclera ECM are chondroitin and dermatan sulfates
[3, 4]. Although sGAGs constitute a small percentage of the scleral dry weight, they seem to
have a critical role in its proper function [1]. For example, loss of chondroitin sulfates was
observed in congenital disorders such as nanophthalmos [5]. It has also been suggested that
sGAGs may play a role in myopia, the most common cause of impaired vision [6–8]. The bio￾chemical and biomechanical properties of the sclera were suggested to affect the axial length of
the eye. Thus, if changes in sGAG content affect mechanical properties of sclera, it could be
hypothesized that sGAGs are important in controlling the ocular axial length and refractive
state [9–12].
The mechanical function of sGAGs in tissues such as tendon [13–17], ligament [18, 19],
and articular cartilage [20–22] has been extensively examined; however, their possible effects
on mechanical properties of scleral tissue have been less studied [23–25]. Furthermore, pres￾sure-controlled inflation experiments showed that sGAG removal had different effects on
human porcine samples, i.e. it decreased the stiffness of porcine posterior sclera while it
increased the stiffness of human sclera [24, 25]. This contradictory effects of sGAGs have been
associated to the older age of human donor samples compared to the porcine ones. However,
it is noted that a) an improved inflation technique was used in the later study on human sam￾ples in order to measure smaller displacements more accurately [26], and b) there was no
direct mechanical comparison between control and enzyme-treated scleral samples.
In general, the inflation testing method investigates the mechanical response of ocular tis￾sues under a physiologically relevant loading condition; thus, it is a preferred technique to
characterize the mechanical response of sclera. However, an accurate interpretation of the
mechanical measurements is not straightforward. In addition to possible experimental bias
errors such as the speckle pattern, image distortion, and illumination condition, the technique
is prone to numerical inaccuracies caused by the required inverse numerical analysis for the
interpretation of experimental data. In the present study, we took a different approach for
characterizing the effects of sGAG digestion on the mechanical behavior of posterior porcine
sclera. We enzymatically depleted dermatan and chondroitin sulfates from the posterior por￾cine scleral strips and characterized their viscoelastic behavior by performing uniaxial stress￾controlled tensile experiments. We complemented these mechanical tests by biochemical anal￾yses and hydration/thickness studies.

strips from the nasal-temporal direction in order to prevent anisotropic bias in the mechanical
measurements. We also obtained scleral disks from the superior-temporal quadrant (overlap￾ping with the center of scleral strips), Fig 1A. These scleral disks were solely used for sGAG
removal confirmation studies and hydration tests.
2.3 Glycosaminoglycan quantification and sGAG removal
sGAGs were digested from the strips/disks by incubating them in 0.125 U/ml Chondroitinase
ABC (ChABC) solution for 18 hours at 37 o
C. The digestion buffer solution consisted of 50
mM Trizma base, 60 mM sodium acetate at pH 8.0, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The
Blyscan, i.e. dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay (Biocolor Ltd., UK) was used to deter￾mine sGAG content of control (immediately after dissection), buffer-, and enzyme-treated
samples, the exact protocol of this assay is well-described in the litrature [27]. Five scleral disks
were used for each group and the sGAG content was reported in μg/mg dry tissue weight. The
Alcian Blue pH 1.0 Stain Kit (Avantik, New Jersey) was also used for obtaining a qualitative
estimate of the success of sGAG removal process. To this end, we stained thin sections of three
buffer- and enzyme-treated samples and imaged them later using a whole slide brightfield
scanner (Aperio AT2, Leica Biosystems).
2.4 Thickness and hydration measurements
The thickness of strips at their centers, near the posterior pole of eyeballs, was measured by a
pachymeter (DGH Technology, Inc.). The measurements were averaged over a 2-mm circle in
the middle of samples, which approximately coincided with the superior-temporal quadrant.
We measured the thickness of scleral disks at their center. A preliminary study confirmed that
the pachymeter thickness measurements agreed with those obtained from a micrometer. In
order to determine the hydration, we measured the weight of eight scleral discs immediately
after dissection and let them completely dry in a desiccator for 48 hours. After measuring their
dry weight with 0.01 mg accuracy, we incubated them in buffer solution for 6 hours and mea￾sured their wet weight in order to be able to determine their swelling rate. We then immersed
the discs either in buffer (n = 4) or in enzyme solution (n = 4) for 18 hours before measuring
their wet weight again, Fig 1B. We computed the hydration of samples by dividing their wet
and dry weights.
2.5 Mechanical tests
We used an RSA-G2 machine (TA instruments, MD) to characterize the effects of sGAG deg￾radation on the tensile response of scleral strips. The thickness of all strips was measured
immediately after dissection and all mechanical experiments were done in buffer solution. In
order to prevent possible effects of hydration variation during the mechanical tests [28–30], we
soaked all samples in buffer solution for 6 hours prior to the mechanical tests (the hydration
study on the scleral disks confirmed that the swelling rate of samples would become very low

showing the mechanical testing protocol and different groups considered in the present study. The samples in the control
group were tested immediately after dissection; three of these samples were incubated in buffer for additional 6 hours and
tested again. The samples in buffer-treated and enzyme-treated groups were initially soaked in buffer for 6 hours, they
were then tested mechanically (first mechanical test), they were then removed from the testing machine and were soaked
for 18 hours in either buffer or enzyme solution (while being still mounted to the testing grips), and were then subjected to
the second mechanical test. The tensile test protocol, including two five cycles of loading-unloading with a five-minute
recovery period in between, is also shown.

after 6 hour buffer incubation). The scleral strips were then mounted to the testing machine
and their tensile response was measured (these measurements will be referred to as 1st
mechanical tests in the following). After the mechanical tests and while they were still clamped
(special clamps were designed and machined for this purpose), we removed specimens from
the testing machine and incubated them in either enzyme (enzyme-treated group, n = 5) or
buffer (buffer-treated group, n = 5) solution for 18 hours at 37 o
C. After measuring the thick￾ness of these incubated strips, we mounted them again to the testing machine and subjected
them to the same cyclic tensile load (these measurements will be referred to as 2nd mechanical
tests in the following), Fig 1C. The first mechanical measurements of each group represented
the tensile properties of samples prior to any significant incubation; these tests allowed us to
compare the effects of buffer (or enzyme) treatment on “paired” samples. Comparing the 2nd
mechanical measurements of buffer- and enzyme-treated groups together let us determine the
effect of sGAG degradation on unpaired specimens.
Thirteen samples (n = 13) were also mechanically tested immediately after dissection before
being subjected to any significant incubation in any solution; these scleral samples formed the
control group and were referred to by symbol C in this work. Three of these samples, after the
mechanical tests, were incubated in buffer for 6 hours (without removing them from the grips)
to assess possible effects of the 6 hr buffer incubation on the tensile response of paired samples;
we used the symbol C-2 to refer to these mechanical measurements in the following, Fig 1C.
We used the destructive DMMB assay on additional five strips to characterize possible vari￾ation in the amount of sGAGs during the mechanical tests, i.e. the amount of sGAGs was mea￾sured after a strip was a) dissected, b) soaked 6 hours in buffer, c) soaked 6 hours in buffer and
mechanically tested, d) soaked 6 hours in buffer, mechanically tested, and soaked in buffer
solution for 18 hours, e) soaked 6 hours in buffer, mechanically tested, soaked in buffer solu￾tion for 18 hours, and mechanically tested for the 2nd time. We only used one sample per each
stage of the testing protocol as incubation in buffer and mechanical tests was not expected to
have any significant effect on the sGAG content. Lastly, to confirm that sGAGs were indeed
digested from the strips, we determined the sGAGs content of two scleral strips by performing
DMMB assay after they were a) soaked 6 hours in buffer, mechanically tested, and soaked in
enzyme solution for 18 hours, b) soaked 6 hours in buffer, mechanically tested, soaked in
enzyme solution for 18 hours, and mechanically tested for the 2nd time. The experimental
mechanical measurements for the above scleral strips, i.e. those that their sGAG content was
quantified using the DMMB assay, were not used in the mechanical measurement data analysis
since they were not subjected to the complete mechanical testing protocol, Fig 1.
In order to have a similar stress history in strips, we included an initial five cycles of load￾ing-unloading with a rate of 1 mm/min and maximum stress of 0.5 MPa in the tensile testing
protocol. The preconditioned samples were then allowed to rest for five minutes and their
stress-strain behavior was characterized during five cycles of loading-unloading with a rate of
1 mm/min and maximum stress of 0.5 MPa, Fig 1. The second five cycles of loading-unloading
were considered in the experimental protocol to be able to confirm that the preconditioning
procedure was successful, i.e. the difference between the stress-strain curves obtained from the
5th cycle of the initial loading-unloading step and the 5th cycle of the second loading-unload￾ing step was negligible (results not shown). We only reported here the tangential moduli at
0.05 MPa (low-stress modulus) and 0.4 MPa (high-stress modulus), maximum strain, and hys￾teresis of the 5th loading-unloading cycle of the second loading-unloading step. Hysteresis, the
energy dissipated during one loading-unloading cycle, was calculated from the area within the
hysteresis loop. Moreover, we represented the loading curve of the 5th loading-unloading

where σ and ε are stress and strain, respectively. The unknown parameters A, B, and C were
found by curve-fitting the experimental data. We reported the data as the mean ± standard
deviation. We used t-test to test the null hypothesis that the means of two paired groups are
equal. Furthermore, we used F-Test to test the null hypothesis that the variances of two
unpaired groups are equal. Finally, we used t-Test with equal/unequal variances (determined
from the F-Test) to determine whether there is any difference between the means of the two
unpaired groups. Finally, we used one-way ANOVA to compare means of several samples
when necessary. All statistical analyses were performed with significance level of 0.05.
3. Results
Histological images depicted significantly less stain intensity in digested scleral samples
(results not shown). The DMMB assay showed that there was more than 90% reduction in the
sGAG content because of enzyme treatment. The sGAG content of control (right after diges￾tion), buffer-treated, and enzyme-treated scleral disks was 6.26 ± 1.17, 5.52 ± 1.3, and
0.36 ± 0.33 μg/mg dry tissue, respectively. Furthermore, the sGAG content of different poste￾rior scleral strips from the buffer-treated group, after dissection, after 6 hour buffer incubation,
after the first mechanical test, after 18 hour soaking in buffer, and at the end of the second
mechanical test, was 5.42 ± 0.92 μg/mg dry tissue (the required dry weight for these five sam￾ples was estimated from the hydration study). No significant difference was observed between
the sGAG content of either the control group and the buffer-treated group (p = 0.43) or the
buffer-treated group and the mechanically tested scleral strips (p = 0.86). This confirmed that
multiple buffer incubations and mechanical tests did not cause any significant variation in the
sGAG content of specimens. The sGAG content for two strips after 18 hour soaking in enzyme
and at the end of the second mechanical test was about 0.39 ± 31 μg/mg dry tissue, i.e. sGAGs
were successfully removed from the strips.

disks was 3.13 ± 0.07, 3.28 ± 0.08, 3.48 ± 0.09, and 3.39 ± 0.10 mg wet weight / mg dry weight
immediately after dissection, after 6-hour incubation in buffer, after 18-hour incubation in
buffer, and after 18-hour incubation in enzyme solution, respectively. For the samples in the

buffer-treated group (Fig 1B), there was a significant difference between the hydration of con￾trol samples and those incubated in buffer for 6 hours (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the hydration
of samples incubated in buffer for 6 hours was significantly different than the hydration of
those incubated in buffer for additional 18 hours (P < 0.05). For the samples in the enzyme￾treated group (Fig 1B), there was a significant difference between the hydration of control sam￾ples and those incubated in buffer for 6 hours (P < 0.05); however, the hydration of samples
incubated in buffer for 6 hours and those incubated in enzyme for additional 18 hours did not
vary significantly (P = 0.06). The control (immediately after dissection) samples of buffer￾treated and enzyme-treated groups had the same hydration (P = 0.86). Furthermore, there was
no significant difference between the hydration of buffer-treated and enzyme-treated groups
after 6 hour buffer incubation (P = 0.73) or after 18 hour incubation in buffer/enzyme solution
(P = 0.26). The exact same trend, but with different p values, was observed for the thickness
variation of scleral disks in buffer-treated and enzyme-treated groups. We did not measure the
hydration of mechanically tested scleral strips but their thickness variation was similar to varia￾tion of thickness of scleral disks, i.e. the same trend, but with different p values, was observed
when calculating the significance of the thickness variation between different strip groups.
Fig 2 shows the variation of all four mechanical measures that were used in this study for
characterizing the viscoelastic tensile response of buffer and enzyme groups. The samples of
the buffer-treated group had maximum strain of 0.068 ± 0.01, modulus at 0.05 MPa of
2.71 ± 0.61 MPa, modulus at 0.4 MPa of 17.00 ± 3.40 MPa, and hysteresis of 2.68 ± 0.375 kJ/m3
during the 1st mechanical test. After buffer treatment for 18 hours, the maximum strain, mod￾ulus at 0.05 MPa, modulus at 0.4 MPa, and hysteresis of buffer-treated group became
0.068 ± 0.012, 2.782 ± 0.698 MPa, 16.903 ± 3.019 MPa, 2.773 ± 0.495 kJ/m3
, respectively. No
significant difference was observed in any of viscoelastic tensile properties because of the
buffer treatment. The samples of the enzyme-treated group had maximum strain of
0.071 ± 0.009, modulus at 0.05 MPa of 2.33 ± 0.5 MPa, modulus at 0.4 MPa of 18.05 ± 1.51
MPa, and hysteresis of 2.83 ± 0.59 kJ/m3 during the 1st mechanical test. After enzyme treat￾ment, the maximum strain, modulus at 0.05 MPa, modulus at 0.4 MPa, and hysteresis of
enzyme-treated group became 0.072 ± 0.009, 2.47 ± 0.59 MPa, 17.21 ± 1.23 MPa, 3.01 ± 0.31
kJ/m3
, respectively. No significant difference was observed in viscoelastic tensile properties
because of the enzyme treatment. Comparing experimental measurements (i.e. the 2nd
mechanical tests) for the buffer- and enzyme-treated samples (unpaired statistical data)
showed no significant difference, either. Finally, no significant difference was detected
between tensile properties of strips of buffer-treated and enzyme-treated groups during the 1st
mechanical tests (unpaired statistical data), suggesting that samples of the present work had
the required randomness. Comparing the tensile response of scleral strips that were tested
right after dissection (i.e. control group that is represented by the symbol C in Fig 2) with that
of strips belong to B(1st) and E(1st) groups, we observed a significant difference in all mechan￾ical measures (P < 0.05) except for the modulus at 0.4 MPa (p = 0.11). This observation sug￾gests that the increase in the hydration of the specimens because the initial 6 hr incubation
affected their tensile response. Comparing the tensile response of control group C with that of
group C2 showed exactly the same trend with different p values. The difference between these
two groups is expected to be because of hydration changes, too.
Fig 3 shows the stress-strain of posterior scleral strips from the buffer- and enzyme-treated
groups. It is seen that neither the buffer treatment nor the enzyme treatment had any signifi￾cant influence on the stress-strain response of specimens. Furthermore, the exponential
expression (1) was able to fit individual experimental measurements with R2 > 0.99; the fit
parameters are given in Table 3.

4. Discussion
The extracellular matrix of sclera is composed of elastin, collagen fibers, and PGs. PGs are
macromolecule compounds consisting of sulfated chains (sGAGs) that are covalently bonded
to a core protein. Both sGAG content of sclera and its viscoelastic mechanical properties have
been reported to change in glaucomatous and myopic eyes [7, 31–35]. This suggests that a rela￾tion between sGAG content and mechanical response of the sclera might exist. In support of
this hypothesis, recent experiments have shown that sGAGs had a significant effect on infla￾tion mechanical behavior of sclera [24, 25]. In particular, it was seen that sGAG removal led to
an overall more compliant mechanical behavior of porcine sclera. However, an exact opposite
effect was reported later for human posterior sclera, for which the experimental technique was
enhanced by improving the lighting and magnification, necessary for capturing smaller dis￾placements more accurately [26]. Furthermore, fewer approximations were used for strain cal￾culation and stress-strain curve analysis, limiting the influence of noise in the data. Although

this work concluded that the enzymatic treatment resulted in a significantly stiffer strain-stress
response of human sclera (P<0.05), it itself had a few inconsistencies. For example, the data
showed that sGAG digestion from the human sclera did not change the strain at maximum
pressure (p ~ 1.0). The primary purpose of the present work was to take a more straightfor￾ward approach to provide new data on possible roles of sGAGs on mechanical properties of
posterior sclera. For this purpose, we determined the mechanical function of sGAGs in the
tensile properties of porcine sclera as measured by successive stress-controlled uniaxial tensile
experiments. We used chondroitinase ABC for digesting the primary sclera sGAGs, i.e. chon￾droitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. We also designed and machined custom built grips in
order to be able to characterize possible effects of sGAG digestion on paired samples as well as
unpaired groups.
The sGAG content of posterior porcine scleral samples from the present study, i.e.
6.26 ± 1.17, 5.52 ± 1.3, and 0.36 ± 0.33 μg/mg dry tissue for the respective control, buffer￾treated, and enzyme-treated samples, was within the same range of those reported by Muri￾enne et al. and Schultz et al. [24, 36]. Schultz et al. reported 4.65 ± 0.33 μg/mg dry tissue weight
for control (right after digestion) while Murienne et al. found, respectively, 6.34 ± 1.91,
7.54 ± 1.68, and 1.09 ± 0.23 μg/mg dry tissue for control, buffer-treated, and enzyme-treated
porcine samples obtained from the ST quadrant. Murienne et al. reported, without an explana￾tion, a slight increase in the average sGAG content because of buffer-treatment, which dis￾agrees with the present study. The difference between sGAG content of the control and buffer￾treated specimens of the present study was not significant (p = 0.43). The slight decrease in the
sGAG content due to the buffer incubation was possibly because sGAGs escaped from the
samples during the incubation period. We also found that neither the incubation in buffer
solution nor the mechanical tests had any significant effect on the sGAG concentration. Fur￾thermore, it was found that the digestion process removed more than 90% of sGAGs from the
tissue. The sGAGs were not completely removed primarily because there exist other types of
sGAGs, e.g. keratan sulfate, which cannot be digested by chondroitinase ABC. The insufficient
incubation time and the lack of complete penetration of digestion solution in specimens might
have also played a role. Thus, it is expected that some sulfated sGAG chains were still present
in the samples of the present study. However, it is noted the density of these remaining sGAGs
was not more than what has been reported in previous sGAG degradation studies of the sclera
tissue [24, 25].
The average thickness of control strips of buffer- and enzyme-treated groups was about 1.2
mm, which agreed very well with 1.24 mm that was reported by Murienne et al. [24]. It is
noted that we measured the thickness of strips at their center area, which coincides with the
thickness measurement of ST samples in Murienne et al.’s work. Similar to this previous study,
buffer- and enzyme-treatment caused a significant variation in the mean thickness of strips,
when compared to their thickness right after dissection (P < 0.05, paired samples), Table 2.
Furthermore, the buffer-treatment after 6 hour incubation significantly increased the thickness
(P < 0.05, paired samples) but the enzyme-treatment had an insignificant effect (p = 0.99 for
scleral strips and p = 0.3 for scleral disks, paired samples), i.e. sGAG degradation affected the
thickness variation of the posterior sclera after 18 hour incubation. This observation agreed
with Murienne et al.’s study on human samples but contradicted with their study on porcine
samples (these authors contributed this different behavior to differences in sGAG content of
pigs and humans). However, the present work using both paired and unpaired samples
showed that, similar to human sclera, porcine scleral thickness decreased following s-GAG
degradation. We observed an exactly similar trend for thickness variation of scleral disks and
strips after being incubated in buffer/enzyme solution. However, the absolute thickness values
of strip and disk specimens were different possibly because a) samples from different animals

were used, b) scleral disks were first dried (a required step for obtaining their dry weight), and
3) strips underwent mechanical tests.
We did not measure the hydration of samples, which were used in the mechanical tests.
This was mainly because we wanted to avoid the possible influence that drying of samples
might have had on experimental measurements. However, we measured the hydration
response of scleral disks, which confirmed that a) the hydration (thickness) variation signifi￾cantly slowed down after 6 hours of incubation in buffer solution, b) the equilibrium hydration
was about 3.2 mg wet tissue / mg dry tissue, and c) the thickness of specimens had a direct rela￾tion with their hydration. We kept all scleral strips in buffer solution for 6 hours prior to
mechanical experiments in order to allow them to reach their equilibrium swelling state, i.e.
hydration effects on mechanical measurements were prevented so that the influence of sGAG
removal could solely be estimated on tensile properties [28–30, 37]. The effect of hydration on
tensile properties of scleral samples can be inferred from comparing the mechanical measures
for group C with those of groups C-2, B(1st), and E(1st), Fig 3. Similar to their thickness, the
hydration of buffer- and enzyme-treated disks did not show a significant difference (P = 0.30);
which was again in contradiction with what was previously reported for porcine sclera but
consistent with the behavior of human samples (note: the change in hydration of humans after
enzyme-treatment was obtained for a single eye in this pervious study) [24, 25]. The small per￾centage of sGAGs, present in enzyme-treated disks, possibly continued to bring water in the
scleral extracellular matrix; this water absorption caused hydration and thickness to increase
during their 18 hour incubation. The alternations in the arrangement of ECM of sGAG￾depleted samples might have also played a role.
Figs 2 and 3 show that there was no significant difference between tensile mechanical prop￾erties of buffer- and enzyme-treated samples. This observation was in contrast to the roles of
sGAGs in mechanical response of porcine sclera in inflation [24]. However, our results agreed
more with the work on human sclera in which the inflation experimental technique was
improved such that displacements were measured more accurately [25, 26]. In this study, the
authors reported the mechanical response by averaging over all specimens and quadrants.
Thus, it is unclear how sGAG degradation affected the mechanical response of individual
quadrants. They also stated that the stiffening effect of sGAG degradation was modest with
some mechanical effects (e.g. meridional hysteresis and maximum strain) being insignificant.
Another important limitation of Murienne et al.’s work is the absence of direct comparison
between control and enzyme-treated porcine sclera, i.e. the main conclusion was reached by
comparing the data obtained for control samples (without any treatment) and enzyme-treated
samples, which were first subjected to buffer-treatment. Had they used the method that they
later used in their study on human samples, i.e. comparing the measurements obtained after
incubation in buffer alone (buffer-treated) with those after subsequent incubation in the
enzyme solution (enzyme-treated), a different conclusion would have been reached for the
effects of sGAGs on the biomechanical properties of the porcine sclera. Finally, it is noted that
it is not unprecedented for sGAGs to play different mechanical roles in different loading con￾ditions. For example, despite their significant effects on the viscoelastic creep response of artic￾ular cartilage, the extraction of sGAGs had no significant influence on the tensile stiffness and
strength when slow constant-rate tensile load was used [38]. Furthermore, no significant con￾tribution of sGAGs to the viscoelastic tensile behavior of human ligaments was found [18, 19].
The mechanical functions of sGAGs could be explained by considering the extracellular
matrix of soft tissues as a composite domain, where collagen fibrils are discontinuous rein￾forcements that require an interfibrillar matrix, formed by sGAGs and their interaction with
each other and collagen fibers, to resist external forces [39, 40]. In this viewpoint, digestion of
sGAGs weakens the matrix component causing a softer tensile mechanical response. Another
sGAG role in scleral tensile response

viewpoint is that the main function of sGAGs is to keep the tissue hydrated, and thus, to facili￾tate the relative movement of collagen fibers [30, 41]. In this model, a stiffer or softer response
is predicted depending on whether sGAG digestion reduces or increases the tissue hydration,
which in turn increases or decreases the friction between collagen fibers. Here and in agree￾ment with the previous pressure-controlled inflation study [24], the thickness of ST samples
did not show any significant variation due to sGAG removal, suggesting that digested samples
had similar hydration to buffer-treated samples, Tables 1 and 2. Thus, in agreement with the
latter model, the average tensile response of enzyme-treated samples was very similar to that of
their corresponding control samples, Fig 3. Unlike the present study, Murriene at al. reported
a significantly stiffer response for porcine sclera after enzyme-treatment and attributed it to
the significantly higher hydration of these samples. This inconsistency in mechanical roles of
sGAGs in porcine sclera requires future investigation focusing on the complex molecular
interaction between extracellular constituents. Despite the clear necessity for future research
in this area, the present findings suggested that, similar to ligaments and tendons, collagen
fibers should be the main load bearing component in the extracellular matrix of the sclera in
tension while sGAGs do not play a significant role [13, 15, 18, 19, 42]. This observation is pos￾sibly because of very low concentration of sGAGs and the presence of interwoven collagen
fibers in sclera, i.e. sGAGs should have a limited contribution to connecting collagen fibers
together and transferring loads among them, Fig 4.
The present study used a testing protocol with a preconditioning step; preconditioning of
scleral strips might have influenced their viscoelastic tensile response such that no mechanical
effects for sGAGs were observed. However, we note that a preconditioning step was also used
in the recent inflation study, where a significant role for sGAGs when subjected to pressure
loads was observed [24]. Unlike pressure-controlled inflation experiments, uniaxial tensile
tests investigate the mechanical response of sclera in a less physiologically relevant loading
Fig 4. a) The interactions between sGAGs and collagen fiber in the scleral extracellular matrix. b) The collagen fibers are highly interwoven and do not requires sGAGs
for load transfer. The remaining sGAGs in enzyme-treated specimens continues to keep the sample hydrated.

condition, which is a clear weakness of the present work. However, tensile tests are often used
for conducting comparative studies in which the mechanical influence of one parameter is
sought [18, 19, 32, 37, 38, 43–45]. The maximum circumferential strain in the previous infla￾tion study was about 0.03–0.06 and 0.003–0.006 for porcine and human samples, respectively.
Although the tensile strains of the present study were significantly larger than those of the
study on the human sclera, they were comparable with what reported for the porcine sclera
under inflation. However, we measured ten times higher stresses, which are in agreement with
previous studies that used the tensile testing method [46, 47]. Future studies are required to
fully understand why different conclusions were made about the structural roles of sGAGs in
tension and inflation. Nevertheless, significantly different testing technique and sample condi￾tions may have contributed to reaching different conclusions.
In summary, this study, for the first time, characterized the contribution of sGAGs to tensile
properties of posterior sclera of pig eyes. It was found that sGAG removal had no significant
effect on the viscoelastic stress-controlled tensile response as characterized by the tangent
moduli, maximum strain, and hysteresis. This was in contrast to the role of sGAGs in the
mechanical response of posterior sclera in pressure-controlled inflation. Future studies exam￾ining the microstructure of sclera in the absence of sGAGs may be able to provide the required
information for explaining these seemingly contradictory conclusions.
