ABSTRACT. Objective. To analyze clinical and serological characteristics of subjects with scleroderma renal cri￾sis (SRC) in Italian patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).
Methods. A retrospective analysis of medical records from 9 Italian rheumatologic referral centers
was carried out. All patients with SRC and an available serum sample at the time of crisis were
included. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence, anti-topoisomerase (topo)
I by enzyme-linked assay (ELISA), anti-RNA polymerases (RNAP) by ELISA for the subunit III,
and immunoprecipitation (IP) were performed.
Results. Forty-six cases (38 female; 40 diffuse cutaneous SSc) were identified. Mean age at SSc and
SRC onset was 52.8 years ± 13.2 and 55.4 years ± 11.8, respectively. ANA were present in 44
patients (96%). Anti-topo I antibodies were detected in 30 (65%), anti-RNAP I–III in 7 (15%). No
differences emerged between these 2 groups for their main clinical characteristics. The proportion of
patients in the anti-RNAP I–III group developing SRC early (< 18 mo) in the course of SSc was sig￾nificantly higher (p = 0.03). Cumulative survival rates were 64%, 53%, and 35% at 1, 2, and 10 years
of followup, respectively. Survival rates of SSc patients significantly differed according to their
autoantibody profile, being lower in the anti-topo I than in the anti-RNAP I–III group (p = 0.034).
Conclusion. SRC is a rare manifestation of SSc in Italy but it is still associated with severe progno￾sis. Anti-topo I reactivity was more frequent than anti-RNAP I–III in our patients with SRC and was
associated with delayed onset and high mortality rates. (First Release June 1 2009; J Rheumatol

Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is a chronic inflam￾matory multiorgan disease whose etiology is still unclear
but which has a strong autoimmune background1. As many
as 95% of patients with SSc display a positive serologic
reaction to antinuclear antibodies (ANA); moreover,
autoantibodies represent a valuable tool in disease classifi￾cation and prognosis2,3.
The main pathological features of SSc are endothelial
damage and abnormal collagen deposition that clinically
manifest with a variable degree of cutaneous and visceral

fibrosis and vascular complications. One of the most serious
of the latter is characterized by onset of a rapidly progres￾sive acute renal failure eventually accompanied by malig￾nant hypertension, termed scleroderma renal crisis (SRC)4.
In British and US cohorts, about 10% of SSc patients expe￾rience SRC, most of them early in the disease course5. The
frequency is also higher (up to 25%) when only patients
with diffuse cutaneous involvement are considered6.
Antibodies to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunits
I–III are mutually exclusive with respect to the 2 other
major SSc autoantibody groups, anti-topoisomerase I
(anti-topo I) and anticentromere (ACA) antibodies, distin￾guishing a serologic subset of patients that, in contrast to
anti-topo I and ACA, more frequently display diffuse cuta￾neous and renal involvement, in particular SRC7,8. This
complication has been reported to occur at lower rates in
countries in the Mediterranean area versus UK and US
series9 and, in parallel, anti-RNAP I–III have been reported
to be relatively rare in patients from Mediterranean coun￾tries10. Such differences were further supported by a direct
comparison of clinical features and serologic characteristics
in 2 groups of patients from the US and France: anti-RNAP
I–III were reported to be more frequent (25% vs 4%) in
American patients, as was occurrence of SRC (9% vs 2%)11.
In our multicenter retrospective analysis we investigated
characteristics of Italian patients with SSc who developed
SRC, with a particular interest in determining their serolog￾ic profile.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. We performed a multicenter retrospective study on patients with
SSc from 9 tertiary referral centers in Italy. We reviewed medical records
of patients observed between 1987 and 2007. Included patients satisfied the
LeRoy criteria for SSc12 and had a diagnosis of SRC defined as abrupt
onset of renal failure with or without accelerated/malignant arterial hyper￾tension4. SSc onset was regarded as the first non-Raynaud symptom attrib￾utable to the disease. The extension of their cutaneous involvement was
classified as limited cutaneous (lcSSc) or diffuse (dcSSc) according to
LeRoy, et al12. Pulmonary involvement was defined as presence of bibasi￾lar fibrosis on standard chest radiographs and/or restrictive lung disease on
pulmonary function tests (PFT) and/or pulmonary hypertension, as
described9. Presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) was
diagnosed if anemia was associated to schistocytes or other erythrocyte
fragments on blood smear, and to increased reticulocyte count.
A total of 51 patients with SRC were identified, and for 46 of them there
were enough clinical data and a serum sample available at the time of SRC
for laboratory assays. Sera had been stored at –70°C by each participating
unit until sent to the single center where serologic investigations were per￾formed simultaneously.
Autoantibodies. Tests for ANA, anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA),
and anti-RNAP determination were conducted simultaneously on all serum
samples. ANA were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence on
HEp-2 cells (Diamedix Co., Miami, FL, USA) with serum diluted 1:80.
ACA were identified from their ANA pattern (centromeric). Other auto￾antibody specificities, including anti-topo I, anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La,
anti-Sm, anti-RNP and anti-Jo1, were evaluated using commercial kits
(EliA test) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Phadia,
Freiburg, Germany).
Anti-RNAP antibodies were tested in patients’ sera by an immunoen￾zymatic kit for anti-RNAP III (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) as described13. The
results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation (IP) assay with 35S-methio￾nine-labelled HeLa cell extracts, as described10.
Statistical analysis. SPSS Software for Macintosh (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) was used. Continuous values are expressed as mean ± standard devi￾ation or median (range) according to the variable distribution. Categorical
variables are expressed as absolute number or percentage. Continuous vari￾ables have been arranged in categories by the median values of their distri￾bution. Student t test, analysis of variance, or Mann-Whitney U test were
performed when appropriate to evaluate differences between groups for
quantitative variables. Posthoc comparisons were evaluated with the
Bonferroni correction when variance between groups was homogeneous.
When appropriate, categorical parameters were compared by chi-square
test or by Fisher’s exact test. Cumulative survival rates were obtained by
Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between groups and between group
stratifications were compared by log-rank test, with correction for each
stratum when needed. Univariate and bivariate analyses of survival were
obtained using the Cox regression model. For all variables in the study, a
2-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics. Demographic and clinical character￾istics of patients are listed in Table 1. We categorized
patients into those presenting with SRC within 18 months of
disease onset, between 18 and 48 months, and after 48
months. Sixty-two percent of SRC cases occurred within the
first 18 months, 18% between 18 and 48 months, and 20%
presented more than 48 months after SSc onset. Patients
with SRC occurring early (< 18 mo) had a significantly
older age (57.2 ± 12 yrs) versus patients developing SRC
later than 48 months in the disease course (40.2 ± 11.9 yrs)
(p = 0.004; Figure 1). Accordingly, age > 54 years at SSc
onset was significantly associated with SRC occurring with￾in 18 months (p = 0.002). The same trend, albeit not statis￾tically significant, was observed for age at SRC onset
between different groups (57.8 ± 11.9 years in cases within
18 months vs 48.1 ± 11.4 years in cases occurring after 48
months; p = 0.92). No other clinical features besides age
were found to distinguish patients with early- and late-onset
SRC.

Renal biopsy, performed in only 5 patients, showed
pathologic changes typical of SRC, such as intimal cell pro￾liferation, intravascular fibrin thrombi, mesangiolysis, and
glomerular and tubular ischemic features.
SRC treatment data were available for only 42 patients.
Among them, 33 (78%) received angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as soon as SRC diagnosis was
established; 26 (62%) required dialysis. Dialysis regimen
was discontinued in 7/26 (27%) patients. Three patients
(7%) received renal transplants after a mean followup of
140 ± 54 months after SRC. They had immediately been
treated with ACE inhibitors and had undergone peritoneal
dialysis. They were alive at the end of the study and showed
recovered renal function after transplant. One developed
isolated pulmonary hypertension and was started on non￾selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist therapy.
Information regarding therapy before SRC was available
for 28 patients: 12 patients were taking low-dose steroids
(< 15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) at the time of SRC;
only 5 received low-dose ACE inhibitors.
The cumulative survival rates at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years were
64%, 53%, 40%, and 35% respectively. Univariate analysis
showed that survival was significantly affected by age at
SRC development, use of steroids prior to the crisis, and
prompt administration of ACE inhibitors after the crisis, but
not by other known clinical characteristics such as sex, age
at SSc onset, type of cutaneous disease, presence of a pul￾monary involvement, or prior ACE inhibitor use. Age > 56
years conferred a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.6 (95% confidence
interval 1.1–6, p = 0.025); steroids before crisis showed a
HR of 3.061 (95% CI 1.155–8.1, p = 0.024), while prompt
treatment with ACE inhibitors had a protective role (HR
0.255, 95% CI 0.07–0.934, p = 0.039).
Autoantibody profile. ANA were positive in 44 patients
(96%) and anti-ENA or anti-RNAP III were positive in 39
(85%). ANA pattern was speckled in 25/44 patients (57%),
nucleolar in 10/44 (23%), homogeneous and nucleolar in
8/44 (18%), homogeneous in 1/44 (2%). An isolated nucle￾olar ANA pattern with no other serological specificities was
detected in 4/44 patients (9%).
IP and ELISA for anti-RNAP III gave concordant results:
in particular, all patients with a positive ELISA test for
anti-RNAP III showed a reactivity in IP for the subunits
I–III of the enzyme. Autoantibody profiles were represented
by anti-topo I, found in 30/46 patients (65%); anti-RNAP
I–III, in 7/46 (15%); and anti-Ro/SSA, in 4/46 (9%). In one
case anti-Ro/SSA were associated with anti-topo I and in
another one with anti-RNAP I–III.
Characteristics of the anti-topo I and anti-RNAP I–III-posi￾tive subsets. We compared demographic and clinical fea￾tures of patients from the 2 most common serological
groups. There was no statistically significant difference
between anti-topo I and anti-RNAP I–III-positive patients
for the age at SSc onset and at the time of SRC. All patients
with anti-RNAP I–III developed SRC within 18 months, and
in 2 out of 7 cases SRC was the presenting feature of SSc.
In the anti-topo I-positive group the onset of SRC occurred
within 18 months of disease in only 15 (50%) cases (p =
0.03) and was the presenting feature in none. In this same
group, 7 (23%) patients developed SRC between 18 and 48
months, and 8 (27%) after 48 months.
All patients in the anti-RNAP I–III group presented with
hypertensive renal crisis, while in the anti-topo I group 12
patients (40%) had a normotensive-type crisis. Mean initial
creatininemia was slightly higher in the anti-topo I-positive
patients (4.9 ± 2.6 mg/dl) than in the anti-RNAP I–III group
(3.6 ± 0.9 mg/dl). No patient among those whose informa￾tion was available (n = 4) in the anti-RNAP I–III group and
8/18 (44%) patients in the anti-topo I group showed pres￾ence of MAHA (all p nonsignificant).
All anti-RNAP I–III-positive patients had diffuse cuta￾neous involvement, while in the anti-topo I-positive group
there were 3 (10%) patients with limited cutaneous disease.
Pulmonary involvement was detected in 18 out of 30
anti-topo I patients (60%) and in 3 out of 7 anti-RNAP I–III
patients (43%). There was no significant difference between
the 2 serological groups for mean forced vital capacity
(anti-RNAP I–III 85% ± 25% vs anti-topo I 85% ± 26%)
and mean carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (anti-RNAP
I–III 77% ± 19% vs anti-topo I 65% ± 26%), both expressed
as percentage of the predicted value (all p = NS).
Data on prior steroid or ACE inhibitor use were available
for 7 patients in the anti-RNAP I-III group and for 18 of the
anti-topo I-positive patients. Two of the 7 (29%) anti-RNAP
I–III patients and 8 of the 18 (44%) anti-topo I patients

received low-dose steroids. No one in the anti-RNAP I–III
group and 5 (28%) patients in the anti-topo I group had been
treated with ACE inhibitors before SRC (all p = NS). Also,
no statistically significant difference was found for the pro￾portions of patients receiving prompt ACE inhibitor treat￾ment for SRC in the 2 groups.
At 5 years of followup, cumulative survival of
anti-RNAP I–III-positive patients was 86% versus 32% in
the anti-topo I group, with a median survival time of 730
days (p = 0.034; Figure 2). This difference also emerged
after adjustment for steroid use before (p = 0.039) or ACE
inhibitor use after SRC crisis (p = 0.05). Analyzing only
those subjects who did not receive steroids, survival at 5
years was 100% in anti-RNAP I–III patients and 33% in
anti-topo I patients. Analogously, considering only those
patients treated for SRC with ACE inhibitors, the 5-year sur￾vival rate was 83% in the anti-RNAP I–III group and 27%
in the anti-topo I group.
Stratifying patients for their cutaneous involvement, the
cumulative survival rates for anti-topo I-positive dcSSc
patients decreased further to 14% at 10 years, values again
significantly lower than those in the anti-RNAP I–III-posi￾tive dcSSc patients (p = 0.013).
Differences in survival rates were not related to later
onset of SRC in the anti-topo I group with respect to
anti-RNAP I–III-positive patients, who all developed SRC
within 18 months. Survival in anti-topo I dcSSc patients
developing SRC within the first 18 months (n = 13) was sig￾nificantly lower (25% at 5 years; p = 0.04). Accordingly, no
significant changes were observed for anti-topo I-positive
patients when a distinction was made for those with SRC
onset within the first 18 months (31% at 5 years) versus
patients with a later onset (30% at 5 years; Figure 3). In our
series of patients, either type of cutaneous involvement or
presence of pulmonary involvement did not significantly
affect survival.
DISCUSSION
In this Italian study on SRC, we found a high percentage of
anti-topo I-positive patients who had a reduced survival rate
compared to anti-RNAP I–III-positive patients.
We were not able to estimate the prevalence of SRC
because of the retrospective design of our data collection.
Nevertheless, the limited number of SRC cases collected
supports previous observations of a rather low prevalence of
SRC in Italian patients with SSc9,14. The main clinical char￾acteristics of our study patients do not seem to diverge from
those observed in other countries, except for a slightly lower
frequency of lcSSc than that reported in a British cohort15-
17. It has been shown that SRC occurs in most patients with￾in 4 years5. In our series, 80% of patients underwent SRC
within 4 years and, in particular, all the anti-RNAP
I–III-positive patients experienced SRC within 18 months.
Interestingly, after categorizing patients by these 2 time￾points, it emerged that patients with early-onset SRC had an
older age at onset of SSc versus patients with a longer dis￾ease course at time of SRC. On the basis of this result a very
close clinical monitoring is warranted, including blood pres￾sure and renal function, in patients with early SSc, especial￾ly in the elderly.
An important issue emerges from analysis of the
auto-antibody profile of our patients. In Italian patients with
SRC the frequency of anti-RNAP I–III antibodies (15%) is
comparable to non-SRC dcSSc patients10, but it seems

lower than British SRC patients (59%)17. Thus, anti-RNAP
I–III do not seem to be specifically associated with SRC in
our country, although this association is somewhat difficult
to evaluate because of the rarity of this autoantibody in our
series, which is indeed reflected by the small number of
patients with anti-RNAP I–III-associated SRC in our coun￾try9,10. These results are in line with the finding that autoan￾tibody frequencies vary in patients from different geograph￾ic areas, and strengthen the hypothesis of a decreasing
north-south gradient for the prevalence of anti-RNAP in
Europe, a feature also suggested for SRC itself10,11.
Accordingly, 65% of the patients with SRC described in our
study were positive for anti-topo I antibodies versus only
17% of the British series. This difference could be explained
in part by the reported higher prevalence of anti-topo I in
Italian patients with respect to Caucasian patients from the
US and UK10,18,19. An important percentage (9%) of
patients in our series displayed anti-Ro/SSA. These data are
consistent with a study in British SSc patients that described
anti-Ro/SSA to be associated with renal involvement in
SSc20. Nevertheless, the lack of specificity of anti-Ro/SSA
reactivity and its presence along with other autoantibodies
makes this association difficult to establish.
The general cumulative survival rates in our series are
slightly lower than those described in other studies from the
US and France4,16. Interestingly, when a stratification is
done on the basis of the autoantibody profile, results show
that these differences are due to the higher mortality rate in
the anti-topo I-positive patients, who also represent the
majority of our cases. The different trend between these
serologic groups is also the result of excluding from the sur￾vival analysis those subjects in our study with onset of SRC
before the early 1990s who were not reported to be prompt￾ly treated with ACE inhibitors, an approach that has since
dramatically changed the outcome of this complication4,21.
When compared to the anti-RNAP I–III group, anti-topo
I patients showed a significantly later onset of SRC. Half of
the patients from our anti-topo I-positive series developed
renal crisis after 18 months of disease course, and 23% after
4 years. However, a delayed onset of SRC is not per se asso￾ciated with a poor prognosis, and other distinctive factors in
this group should be investigated. Yet again, this observa￾tion underscores the need for physicians to continuously fol￾low up on patients’ renal function and blood pressure during
the course of disease to promptly identify this renal compli￾cation and to initiate appropriately aggressive treatment
immediately on diagnosis.
Possible explanations for the different survival findings
in the 2 serological groups analyzed could also be the seem￾ingly different presentations of patients in these subsets. In
our study anti-RNAP I–III patients all displayed an acute
course (within a short time after disease onset, hypertensive￾type crisis), which is reported to be associated with more
favorable prognosis15-17, while the clinical picture in
anti-topo I-positive patients was likely masked by the nor￾motensive-type crisis, which might have delayed diagnosis
and treatment, and may also have been favored by steroids,
whose negative role in SRC has been clearly established16.
The main limitations of our study are the lack of detailed
clinical data regarding other organ involvement, which
could have been a critical factor explaining the different out￾comes, and the limited data on therapy. The multicenter and
retrospective design explains the difficulty in collecting
complete information. These issues also influenced the
strength and significance of the statistical analysis in evalu￾ating clinical differences between the 2 main serological
groups and in the combined estimate of risk factors.
Nevertheless, our data strongly support the high relevance
of autoantibodies in SSc as useful prognostic tools in clini￾cal practice and their strong contribution to patient subsets
and stratification in the event of SRC.
Despite a dramatic decrease in SRC-related mortality in
patients with SSc in recent decades21, survival in patients
who develop SRC remains lower than that expected in SSc
patients without SRC8,22. Our data support the view that
anti-RNAP I–III-positive SRC, which is more frequent in
the US and UK, is associated with a quite favorable out￾come, while the anti-topo I-positive SRC subset, the most
common in our series, is associated with a severe prognosis.
Larger prospective studies are needed to identify factors and
comorbidities accounting for such a high mortality rate in
anti-topo I-positive patients with SRC.
