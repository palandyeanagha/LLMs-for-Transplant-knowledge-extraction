Currently, liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage liver disease.
Immunosuppressive agents are required to be taken after the operations, which have
significantly reduced rejection rates and improved the short-term (<1 year) survival
rates. However, post-transplant complications related to the immunosuppressive therapy
have led to the development of new protocols aimed at protecting renal function
and preventing de novo cancer and dysmetabolic syndrome. Donor specific immune
tolerance, which means the mature immune systems of recipients will not attack the
grafts under the conditions without any immunosuppression therapies, is considered
the optimal state after liver transplantation. There have been studies that have shown
that some patients can reach this immune tolerance state after liver transplantation.
The intrahepatic immune system is quite different from that in other solid organs,
especially the innate immune system. It contains a variety of liver specific cells, such
as liver-derived dendritic cells, Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, liver-derived
natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and so on. Depending on their specific
structures and functions, these intrahepatic innate immune cells play important roles
in the development of intrahepatic immune tolerance. In this article, in order to have a
deeper understanding of the tolerogenic functions of liver, we summarized the molecular
mechanisms of immune tolerance induced by intrahepatic innate immune cells after liver
transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
The past three decades have seen liver transplantation becoming a major treatment approach for
end-stage liver disease. This is because of the dramatic improvement in survival after liver
transplantation. Actually, improved use of post-transplant immunosuppression is a major factor.
In order to prevent acute and chronic rejection, long-term immunosuppression is required to avoid
severe acute and chronic rejection and graft loss. Up to now, the backbone of immunosuppression
therapy remains calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) mostly associated with steroids in the short-term and
mycophenolate mofetil or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. However, there are
some post-transplant complications related to immunosuppressive therapy, such as renal injury,
de novo cancer, dysmetabolic syndrome, and so on. In the future, immunosuppression will be more
oriented, aiming to protect the graft from rejection and at reducing the risk of disease recurrence
and complications related to immunosuppressive therapy, including promoting stable long-term
immunological tolerance of the liver graft. The liver has been shown to be more tolerogenic than

Huang et al. Innate Immune Cells and Liver Transplantation
other solid organs, and most hepatic allografts can be accepted
with low-dose immunosuppressive therapy. It can be exemplified
by oral tolerance (which means the mucosal immune system
maintains unresponsiveness to antigens that might induce
unexpected immune responses) and portal venous tolerance
(which means the induction of peripheral tolerance following
portal venous delivery of most alloantigens). Other phenomena
attributed to hepatic immune tolerance consist of persistent
microbial infections and gastrointestinal tumor metastases in
the liver (1). Besides this, the liver can induce tolerance for
other transplanted organs and decrease the risk of rejection of
associated organs, such as heart, kidney, skin, pancreas, and
so on (2). There were plenty of signs that showed that the
internal microenvironment of the liver could play a role in the
development of immune tolerance after transplantation.
Liver is an organ with double blood supply, from the portal
vein and the hepatic artery. Arterial and venous blood mix
in the liver, resulting in low oxygen tension, low perfusion
pressure, and slow and irregular blood flow within the hepatic
sinusoids, which assist the intrahepatic cells and molecules to
fully contact each other. Generally, the adaptive system in the
liver includes humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity.
They are carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T
cells), which recognize and respond to pathogens in antigen￾specific ways. By contrast, the innate immune cells contained
in the liver are quite different from those in the peripheral
blood, including liver-derived dendritic cells (DCs), Kupffer cells,
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), liver-derived natural
killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and so on. These
innate immune cells participate in constituting the immune
microenvironment in the liver. Their tolerogenic functions are
met by two mechanisms. First, intrahepatic innate immune cells
express low or undetectable levels of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) antigens, costimulatory molecules, and other
effector molecules, which means it will be difficult for these
intrahepatic cells to induce innate or adaptive immune response.
Second, innate immune cells in the liver can also exert their
immunosuppressive effects by interfering with the functions
of other intrahepatic cells, by secreting immunosuppressive
cytokines [such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth
factor- β (TGF-β), indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and so on]
or by directly contacting them. In this review, we clarified some
potential mechanisms to illustrate human liver allograft tolerance
induced by intrahepatic innate immune cells.
DENDRITIC CELLS (DCS) IN TOLERANCE
Dendritic cells are derived primarily from the bone marrow,
as well as from the liver and the spleen. As a heterogeneous
population of antigen presenting cells (APCs), DCs play
pivotal roles in the initiation of immunity and the induction
of immunological tolerance depending on their maturation
state and subsets. Recently, regulatory DCs, which mean
DCs with immune regulatory functions, have attracted much
attention. Up to now, several kinds of regulatory DC had been
reported, such as CD11clowI-AlowCD11bhi splenic regulatory
DCs (3) and CD11clowCD45RB+DCs (4, 5). They have common
characteristics, including immature DC phenotype, high IL-10
and low IL-12p70 secretion, and inhibition of T-cell proliferation.
It has been proved that the liver microenvironment could
program differentiation of bone marrow derived progenitors into
regulatory DCs. In a heterotopic liver transplantation model in
rats, He et al. (6) have found that the graft survival rate can
be greatly improved by infusing immature DCs (imDCs) into
the recipient rats. It has been suggested that the overexpression
of the zinc finger protein A20 could effectively inhibit the
maturation of DCs that are resident in the liver allograft and
consequently suppress acute liver allograft rejection. Dai et al. (7)
have demonstrated that A20 treatment could significantly inhibit
transplantation induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mediated
activation of DCs resident in the liver allograft, which was
consistent with the changes of costimulatory molecule and IL￾12 mRNA expression of DCs. Since NF-κB has been shown as a
pivotal nuclear transcriptional regulator of DC maturation and
immunostimulatory ability (8), it presumably plays an essential
role in this process.
In normal conditions, DCs derived from human or mouse
livers can secrete certain amounts of IL-10, inducing lower T
cell response and promoting regulator T cell (Treg) generation,
with a definite effect on immune tolerance (9–11). Besides
this, Kushwah et al. (12) have found that viable immature
DCs have the ability to uptake apoptotic DC, which suppresses
the subsequent maturation of viable DC and mediates the
differentiation of naïve T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs (12). However,
under inflammatory conditions, quiescent DCs transform from
a tolerant state into a responsive state. Dendritic cells located in
sinusoids and portal area can fully contact T cells and induce T
cell-mediated immune responses (13).
MYELOID DENDRITIC CELLS (mDCs)
In mice, liver myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) have lower maturity
than those in secondary lymphoid tissues, both in terms of
phenotype and function (14–16). It is mainly reflected by the
lower expression level of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules
on the cell surface (16) and lower secretion of IL-12 after toll-like
receptor (TLR) activation while there is a higher production of
IL-10 and IL-27, which have been found to be closely related to
the low response of T cells induced by liver DCs (17). Overall, in
in vivo experiments on mice, mDCs derived from the liver show
reduced ability to activate allogeneic naïve T cells (14–16).
In addition to the lower maturation state, the liver-derived
mDCs can also induce immune tolerance by affecting T cell
function. In mice, Khanna et al. (18) injected liver-derived mDCs
into allogeneic recipients and found that they can induce T
cells to secrete IL-10 (18). Besides this, in vitro experiments
have shown that the interactions between NK cells (through
their inhibitory receptor NKG2A) and hepatocytes can change
the concentrations of some important cytokines in the local
microenvironment [for example, an increase in TGF-β and a
decrease in tumor necrosise factor- α (TNF-α)], thus, inducing
the differentiation of a group of special DCs that have an

Huang et al. Innate Immune Cells and Liver Transplantation
immune tolerance function. This kind of DCs can induce the
differentiation of a special type of Treg, which can inhibit T
cell response via the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway (19).
Based on these results, Liu et al. (20) found that in vitro liver–
derived DCs are more likely to induce Treg differentiation than
spleen-derived DCs, and this process depended on the high
programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level of
liver-derived DCs (20).
Besides this, the interactions between mDCs and hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs) can also induce immune tolerance effects.
By secreting all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), HSCs can induce
the syntheses of arginase1 (ARG1) and inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) in mDCs. Among them, ARG1 can degrade the
arginine in the local microenvironment, while iNOS can induce
the synthesis of NO, thus, inhibiting the function of effector
T cells (21). At the same time, HSCs can secrete a variety of
cytokines [for example IL-1, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2
(CCL2), and CCL3], which can activate the downstream signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling
pathway in mDCs and finally prompt mDCs to express IDO and
PD-L1. The former (IDO) can catabolize the tryptophan in local
microenvironment while the latter (PD-L1) can bind to the PD-1
on the effector T cells (22–24).
PLASMACYTOID DENDRITIC CELLS
(pDCs)
In general conditions, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can
present a small fraction of antigens and then activate T cells,
although its function is much weaker than mDCs. It has been
found that when compared with spleen-derived pDCs, liver￾derived pDCs in mice showed immature phenotype and low
secretion level of IL-12p70; thus, they showed a reduced ability
to present antigens or activate T cells (25, 26). Besides this, a
new subpopulation of CCR9+ pDCs was identified as tolerogenic
pDCs in an acute graft-vs.-host disease model (27). It has
been demonstrated that this subset of pDCs exist abundantly
in the murine liver, produce IL-10 and TGF-β, and induce
the differentiation of naïve T cells into a regulatory phenotype
through the TLR7/9 pathway (28).
In terms of the interactions with other cells, the liver-derived
pDCs have a lower Delta4/Jagged1 ratio of Notch ligands on the
cell surface, which means that they can predominantly induce
T cells to differentiate into T helper 2 (Th2) cells. As with
mDC, pDC can upregulate the expression of PD-L1 through the
STAT3 pathway under the impact of IL-27, thereby, inhibiting the
function of the effector T cell (29, 30).
KUPFFER CELLS IN TOLERANCE
Liver has the largest number of residential macrophages, named
Kupffer cells, accounting for approximately 20% of the non￾parenchymal cells in the liver. In general conditions, Kupffer cells
are located in the hepatic sinusoid in order to fully interact with
various molecules and cells in the blood. Their main functions
are phagocytosing, secreting cytokines [such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12,
IL-18, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (31)], and processing and presenting
antigens (32, 33).
Under a resting circumstance, compared with DCs,
Kupffer cells express significantly lower levels of MHC-II
and costimulatory molecules (such as B7-1, B7-2, CD40).
Therefore, as intrahepatic APCs, their functions are significantly
weaker than DCs. Moreover, You et al. (34) have found that
steady-state Kupffer cells are able to secrete prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) and 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2), which can
directly inhibit antigen-specific CD4+ T cells activation (34, 35).
In addition, through animal models, Sass et al. (36) confirmed
that high doses of TNF can induce hepatocytes apoptosis,
whereas low doses of TNF (pretreatment with 10 µ/kg) have
the exact opposite role. After the invasion of endotoxin, Kupffer
cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (37) and
TGF-β (38) in response to continuous stimulation with low levels
of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This phenomenon is called LPS
tolerance. In addition, increased TLR4-mediated expression of
adhesion molecules in LSECs and KCs following continuous LPS
exposure promoted trapping of T cells within the liver, resulting
in lower numbers of circulating primed CD8+ T cells and weak
immune responses (39).
Apart from secreting cytokines, Kupffer cells can directly
interact with Tregs to stimulate their proliferation and induce
them to secrete IL-10, which can inhibit the immune effect of
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) on hepatocyte-expressed antigens
(40, 41). Kuniyasu et al. (42) have undertaken the researches
into the outcomes of activated CD8+ T cells in the liver and
found that some of them can be retained in the liver. In
the meantime, Kupffer cells can encourage the proliferation of
these activated CD8+ T cells in the early period while they
promote apoptosis in the late period. Ultimately, the CTL￾mediated cellular immunity can be inhibited by Kupffer cells (42).
Through animal experiments, Chen et al. (43) have found that
Kupffer cells can promote T cell apoptosis through the Fas/Fas-L
pathway. This effect can be inhibited by the Fas-L antibody (43).
Similarly, there were researches that showed that Kupffer cells
highly expressing PD-L1 can also inhibit the proliferation and
functions of T cells by directly contacting them (44). Apart from
this, human Kupffer cells activated through TLR2/4 pathways
can synthesize IL-10, thus, suppressing IL-18-dependent NK cell
activation (45).
LIVER SINUSOIDAL ENDOTHELIAL CELLS
(LSECs) IN TOLERANCE
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells account for about 50% of the
non-parenchymal cells in the liver. The structure of LSEC is
just like a perforated screen plate. They constitute the wall of
the hepatic sinusoid. There is no basement-membrane at the
inside/outside of LSECs, with only a few reticular fibers attached
on them. In the liver, it has been reported that LSECs can
be a unique population of organ-resident APCs; they display
scavenger activity with the capacity to (cross) present exogenous
antigens on both MHC II and MHC I molecules to CD4 or CD8 T
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 November 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2401

Huang et al. Innate Immune Cells and Liver Transplantation
cells, respectively (46, 47). Some animal experiments showed that,
in normal conditions, although LSECs express only a few of the
MHC class II molecules, they can induce the activation of naive
CD4+ T cells and promote their secretion of interferon-γ IFN-γ,
IL-4, and IL-10 (48). However, LSECs are not capable of inducing
the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into their effector T
helper 2 (Th1) cell subpopulation (47).
As APCs, LESCs have specific immune tolerance-inducing
effects on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. For CD4+ T cells,
animal experiments have proved that after injecting allogeneic
cells into the portal venous systems, the LSECs in the recipient
mice express significantly increased levels of FasL. By this way,
LESCs can induce apoptosis of CD4+ T cells via the Fas-FasL
pathway, inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and their
secretion of IL-2 (49). For CD8+ T cells, there is a process
called cross-tolerance. As observed with other APCs, LSECs are
able to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells via
MHC-I molecules. Once LSECs contacted CD8+ T cells, in the
early period, CD8+ T cells showed a prominent proliferation
effect, and the expression of CD69, CD25, CD44, and PD-1
on the surface of CD8+ T cells were unregulated. But soon
afterwards, the interaction between LSECs and CD8+ T cells
results in an upregulation of the inhibitory molecules (such
as B7-H1) on LSECs, rather than the costimulatory molecules
(such as CD80/86). It has been indicated that Bim, a pro￾apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is a pro-apoptotic mediator of
this cross-tolerance process (50). Finally, we can obtain a specific
subpopulation of LSECs (B7-H1highCD80/86lowLSECs), which
can inhibit the cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell but fail to induce
the clonal deletion of this subpopulation (51).
Besides the mechanism mentioned above, LESCs also have
immune tolerance effects that are independent of their antigen
presenting function. Through animal experiments, Kruse et al.
(52) found that, under the influence of LSECs, CD4+ T cells can
differentiate into CD25lowFoxP3−Tregs, which can inhibit the
proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells. The animal model of T cell￾mediated autoimmune hepatitis has shown that CD25lowFoxP3−
Tregs can downregulate the alanine aminotransferase (ALT;
glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) level in peripheral blood and
inhibit the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue
(52). In terms of immune regulation, LESCs can secrete liver and
lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin).
The LSECtin can interact with CD44 on the surface of activated
T cells, inhibits the secretion of effector cytokines by them (such
as IL-2, IFN-γ and so on), and even induces T cell apoptosis (53).
After repetitive invasions of LPS, LSECs reduce NK-κB activation
and mediate liver tolerance to maintain the homeostasis in the
liver (39). In addition, LESCs can interfere with the activation of
CD8+ T cells by DCs through direct physical contact with DCs
(54).
NATURAL KILLER CELLS (NK CELLS) IN
TOLERANCE
Natural killer cells account for the largest proportion (about
30–50%) of all lymphocytes (which consist of NK, NKT, γδT,
αβT, and B cells) in a normal adult liver (55, 56). They are
important mediators of liver damage in viral and inflammatory
liver disease (57–59). Their functions are controlled by balance
of activatory and inhibitory signals. In general, NK cells
can be divided in two groups based on the molecular
markers on their cell surface, CD3−CD56dimCD16+CD27−
and CD3−CD56brightCD16−CD27+ NK cells. Among them,
the former performs as professional cytotoxic cell, while the
latter has a strong ability of cytokine secretion (mainly IFN-γ
and TNF-α) (55, 60). Liver-derived NK cells are different
from those in the peripheral blood, with higher expression
of activation receptors (such as CD69, NKp44, NKp46,
NKG2D), inhibition receptors (such as NKG2A+), and TNF
related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), higher secretion
of perforin and granzyme, and stronger cytotoxicity (56, 61,
62).
It is generally believed that, in liver transplantation, NK
cells play roles in both rejection and tolerance. According to
their origins, liver-derived NK cells can be divided in two
groups, donor-derived NK cells and recipient-derived NK cells.
It has been found that the recipient-derived NK cells play
a major role in immune rejection, while the donor-derived
NK cells mainly promote immune tolerance (61). Jamil et al.
(63) have found that after liver transplantation, recipient NK
cells exhibit tolerant phenotypes, with the downregulation of
activating receptors and reduced cytotoxicity and cytokine
production. Their research also revealed that NK cell tolerance
is associated with perturbation of the IL-12/STAT4 signaling
pathway, which might be a therapeutic target for clinical practice
(63). There are clinical studies that showed that compared
with the recipients who developed post-operation immune
rejection, those with post-operation immune tolerance had
significantly higher percentages and absolute counts of NK
cells in their peripheral blood (64). Li et al. (65) have found
that there are 13 genes that are significantly overexpressed
in the NK cells of immune tolerant recipients after liver
transplantation. This phenomenon suggested that NK cells
may be involved in the induction of immune tolerance
(65).
NATURAL KILLER T (NKT) CELLS IN
TOLERANCE
Natural killer T cells mostly exist in the liver, spleen, and
bone marrow. They can express the molecular markers of NK
cells. Beyond this, there are specific T cell receptor (TCR)
Vα chains on their cell surface, which can recognize the
glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d. Through the mechanism
mentioned above, NKT cells can rapidly produce a large amount
of cytokine (Th1 or Th2 type) and mediate immune response
through direct or indirect ways. It is currently believed that
Valpha14 NKT cells play a role in graft immune tolerance.
Ikehara et al. (66) used animal experiments to show that
mice deficient in Valpha14 NKT cells were not able to induce
immune tolerance after pancreatic islets transplantation until

the exogenous Valpha14 NKT cells were injected into the mice
(66).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF TOLERANCE IN
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
As compared with other solid organs, it is clear that human
liver allografts show unique immunological features. It can be
performed across positive cross matches, with small doses of
immunosuppressive regimens and less frequent rejection events.
For liver transplantation, some patients can eventually totally
withdraw their immunosuppression therapy without undergoing
rejection. This is a phenomenon called spontaneous operational
tolerance, firstly reported in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh
(67–69). Following this, several single centers described their
experiences with the discontinuation of immunosuppression
because of patient non-compliance (70–75). A US multicenter
pediatric trial enrolled 20 recipients of parental living donor
liver grafts at least 4 years after transplantation (76). Drug
withdrawal was successfully accomplished in 12 patients for
more than 6 years. Successful drug withdrawal was defined
as 1 year off immunosuppression with normal liver function
tests, for example liver biopsies performed at enrollment and
2 and 4 years after complete drug discontinuation that failed
to show clinically significant histological changes. From these
researches, we can see that the time after transplantation
is a key factor associated with spontaneous operational
tolerance. At present, a number of clinical trials are put
into practice to confirm the high prevalence of tolerance
among long-term surviving recipients, to help clarify the
mechanisms behind human liver allograft tolerance and to
determine whether it is possible to prospectively identify tolerant
recipients on immunosuppression by employing diagnostic
biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
CHALLENGES
Up to now, it has been more than 40 years since the first
time people regarded the liver as an immune-tolerant organ
(77). During this period, people researched for the molecular
mechanisms inducing intrahepatic immune tolerance and
accumulated substantial evidence through animal experiments.
However, currently, the relative lack of human studies in this
field is one of the major problems that need to be overcome
in the future. Although intrahepatic innate immune cells play
important roles in inducing immune tolerance after liver
transplantation (Figure 1), we seldom hear about clinical cases
using their functions to reduce the doses of immunosuppressive
agents. In addition, some animal experiments and clinical
studies have shown that after the invasion of external pathogens
(bacteria or viruses), some receptors (especially TLRs) on
the surface of innate immune cells are activated, inducing
the release of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TNF-α,
IFN-I, and so on), further interrupting the development of
intrahepatic immune tolerance (78). Interestingly, in 2014, the
study performed by Bohne et al. (79) showed that for hepatitis
C virus (HCV)-infected recipients, tolerance was associated with
intrahepatic overexpression of type I IFN and an expansion
of exhausted HCV-specific circulating CD8+ T cells. This is
in contrast to what we had previously reported, that is, IFN-I
can activate STAT4 and contribute to Th 1 response, which
play a central role in allograft rejection (80). For this special
circumstance of HCV infection, the author hypothesized that
high intrahepatic IFN-I signaling induced by HCV infection
caused T cell exhaustion, inactivated allo-specific T cell clones,
and promoted a tolerogenic liver microenvironment that
facilitates operational tolerance. On the basis of these results,
we conclude that usually intrahepatic innate immune cells

are in balanced states, between pro- and anti-inflammation.
Under normal resting conditions, intrahepatic innate immune
cells mainly induce intrahepatic immune tolerance, whereas
under inflammatory conditions, they promote immune response
and release inflammatory cytokines. Further exploration of
the essential factors in the transformation of intrahepatic
innate immune cells between these two states is of great
importance for finding out the mechanisms of intrahepatic
immune tolerance.
