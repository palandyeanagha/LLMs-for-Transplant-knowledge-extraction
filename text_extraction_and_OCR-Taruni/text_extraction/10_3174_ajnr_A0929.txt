Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome,
Part 2: Controversies Surrounding
Pathophysiology of Vasogenic Edema
W.S. Bartynski SUMMARY: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurotoxic state accompanied
by a unique brain imaging pattern typically associated with a number of complex clinical conditions
including: preeclampsia/eclampsia, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, solid organ transplanta￾tion, autoimmune diseases and high dose cancer chemotherapy. The mechanism behind the devel￾oping vasogenic edema and CT or MR imaging appearance of PRES is not known. Two theories have
historically been proposed: 1) Severe hypertension leads to failed auto-regulation, subsequent hyper￾perfusion, with endothelial injury/vasogenic edema and; 2) vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion leads to
brain ischemia and subsequent vasogenic edema. The strengths/weaknesses of these hypotheses are
reviewed in a translational fashion including supporting evidence and current available imaging/clinical
data related to the conditions that develop PRES. While the hypertension/hyperperfusion theory has
been most popular, the conditions associated with PRES have a similar immune challenge present and
develop a similar state of T-cell/endothelial cell activation that may be the basis of leukocyte trafficking
and systemic/cerebral vasoconstriction. These systemic features along with current vascular and
perfusion imaging features in PRES appear to render strong support for the older theory of vasocon￾striction coupled with hypoperfusion as the mechanism.
The mechanism of posterior reversible encephalopathy syn￾drome (PRES) is not known. Two opposing hypotheses are
commonly cited, but the issue is controversial: 1) The current
more popular theory suggests that severe hypertension ex￾ceeds the limits of autoregulation, leading to breakthrough
brain edema; 2) the earlier original theory suggests that hyper￾tension leads to cerebral autoregulatory vasoconstriction,
ischemia, and subsequent brain edema. The issues surround￾ing these theories are reviewed to summarize the potential
values of each mechanism.
Current Popular Theory: Hypertension, Failed
Autoregulation, Hyperperfusion
Severe hypertension with failed autoregulation, injury to the
capillary bed, and hyperperfusion remains the most popular
theory for the brain edema that develops in PRES.1-4 This con￾cept is naturally intuitive, due to the frequent presence of hy￾pertension at toxicity, and was originally embraced as the
cause of eclampsia, historically labeled as a “hypertensive dis￾order of pregnancy.” The hypertension/hyperperfusion the￾ory is primarily based on blood pressure exceeding the auto￾regulation limits of the brain.
Autoregulation
Autoregulation is an intrinsic function of the vasculature of
the brain, designed to maintain a stable blood flow in the face
of fluctuating blood pressure.5,6 Under normal circumstances,
brain vessels possess intrinsic vascular tone.7 With autoregu￾lation, vasodilation occurs as blood pressure drops and vaso￾constriction occurs as blood pressure increases.5-7 This func￾tion is regulated by the endothelium with release of relaxing
factors (endothelium-derived relaxing factor: nitric oxide)
and vasoconstriction factors (thromboxane-A2 and endothe￾lin).6 Approximately 80% of cerebrovascular resistance is re￾lated to the small arteries, arterioles, and capillary bed, with
the remaining 20% contributed by postcapillary venules and
veins.7 Autoregulation is managed by the principal resistance
vessels, the arterioles with a diameter of 30 –300 m.6,7
In humans, the lower limit of autoregulation is approxi￾mately 40 –60 mm Hg mean arterial pressure (2/3 diastolic 
1/3 systolic pressure) with an upper limit mean arterial pres￾sure of 150 –160 mm Hg.6,8-10 With reduced blood pressure
beyond the lower limits of autoregulation, hypoperfusion oc￾curs with potential infarction. With severe increase in blood
pressure beyond the upper limit of autoregulation, animal
studies demonstrate breakthrough with passive arteriolar di￾lation, pinocytotic fluid transfer, injury to the capillary bed,
vasogenic edema, and vessel injury with altered arterial mor￾phology.8-10 Above a mean arterial pressure of 200 mm Hg,
vessel morphologic changes tend to be permanent and hypo￾capnia develops.9 In dog and cat studies, breakthrough perfu￾sion occurs above a mean arterial pressure of approximately
170 –180 mm Hg.8-10
Of importance, several factors can alter the upper limit by
up to 30 mm Hg.11 Cerebral vessels possess a rich sympathetic
neural supply, and sympathetic stimulation will increase the
upper limit of autoregulation.5,7 The upper limit will also in￾crease in the setting of chronic hypertension.5
Observations Supporting Hypertension with
Autoregulatory Failure
The popularity of the hypertension/hyperperfusion theory is
primarily related to the common presence of significant blood
pressure elevation at toxicity. Moderate-to-severe hyperten￾sion is encountered in 50%–70% of patients with PRES at
toxicity, and emergent hypertension treatment is associated
with symptom improvement in hours, days, or weeks.12-14 In

some patients, hypertension can be quite severe, clearly chal￾lenging the upper limits of autoregulation.15-18
Investigating the brain effects of severe hypertension, a se￾ries of animal studies demonstrate that when the upper limits
of autoregulation are exceeded, breakthrough occurs with the
development of blood vessel alteration, capillary bed injury,
vasogenic edema, and hyperperfusion.8-10 To my knowledge,
no large clinical series has been reported, but evidence of hy￾perperfusion has been suggested in isolated case reports of
patients studied with technetium Tc99m-hexamethylpropyl￾eneamine oxime (Tc99m-HMPAO) single-photon emission
CT (SPECT) and induced hypertension studied by arterio￾venous oxygen (O2) difference.3,4,19
Problems with the Hypertension/Hyperperfusion Theory
Although intuitive, several problems exist with fully embrac￾ing the hypertension/hyperperfusion theory in PRES.
Blood Pressure. PRES is commonly seen without hyper￾tension or with only minor increase of blood pressure at tox￾icity as noted in larger studies of eclampsia, allogeneic bone
marrow transplant (allo-BMT), solid organ transplant (SOT),
and a wide variety of case reports.20-23 Equally important, even
when significant hypertension is present, toxicity blood pres￾sure does not typically reach the limits of failed autoregula￾tion.15,24-28 Also of note, increased sympathetic activation sec￾ondary to cyclosporine has been documented after heart
transplantation.29,30 As mentioned previously, the upper limit
of autoregulation is increased in the presence of sympathetic
stimulation.5
Hyperperfusion. Evidence documenting hyperperfusion
is scant. Several isolated early case reports have suggested ob￾serving hyperperfusion in the setting of PRES.3,19 More re￾cently, a number of moderate-to-large series have demon￾strated watershed hypoperfusion in eclampsia by technetium
Tc99m HMPAO SPECT and reduced brain perfusion in the
posterior brain or in regions of PRES by MR perfusion
(MRP).24,31-33 Abnormal radiopharmaceutical uptake could
represent luxury perfusion due to loss of autoregulatory vas￾cular tone as opposed to true hyperperfusion.34
Systemic Toxicity. PRES typically develops in the setting of
a significant ‘systemic process’, including preeclampsia, trans￾plantation (allo-BMT, SOT), infection/sepsis/shock, autoim￾mune disease, and cancer chemotherapy.23 In toxemia of
pregnancy (the best studied of these conditions), systemic va￾soconstriction is present (including cerebral vasoconstriction)
and is considered responsible for the developing hyperten￾sion.35,36 Unfortunately, animal models used to test autoreg￾ulation have not been performed under these conditions but
rather in healthy animals. Similar to the effects of sympathetic
stimulation, the autoregulatory response of the brain may be
altered in the setting of systemic toxicity (ie, toxicity-induced
cerebral/systemic vasoconstriction).
Brain Edema. The extent of brain edema in PRES does not
appear to increase with the severity of hypertension. In recent
studies on PRES in patients with infection/sepsis/shock and in
patients studied by catheter angiography (CA) and MR an￾giography (MRA), the extent of brain edema was statistically
lower in those with severe hypertension at toxicity compared
with those who were normotensive at toxicity.24,37 This was
also observed in PRES developing after SOT between liver
(primarily normotensive with greater edema) and renal (se￾verely hypertensive with low edema) transplantations.38 If se￾vere hypertension were the cause of PRES vasogenic edema,
the opposite observations would be expected.
Early Original Theory: Vasoconstriction, Hypoperfusion,
Ischemia
Early imaging reports of eclampsia, cyclosporine neurotoxic￾ity, and severe hypertension demonstrated brain hypoattenu￾ating areas by CT, particularly in the parietal/occipital
region.23 Parallel demonstration of parietal/occipital abnor￾mality at CT and vasospasm at CA in patients with hyperten￾sion and eclampsia prompted several investigators to suggest
that ischemia caused the brain parenchymal abnormality.39,40
According to the traditional version of this theory, vasocon￾striction secondary to evolving hypertension and autoregula￾tory compensation leads to reduced brain perfusion, ischemia,
and subsequent vasogenic edema.41
For the past 20 years, the typical conditions that develop
PRES are better recognized and the biology underlying toxic￾ity in these patients is better understood. Although currently
less favored, many of the clinical/imaging features now iden￾tified in these conditions fundamentally support the original
basic concept of hypoperfusion/vasoconstriction in PRES.
PRES without Hypertension
Of critical importance, PRES develops in normotensive pa￾tients and in patients with only mild blood pressure elevation.
In 20%–30% of patients who develop PRES, blood pressure is
essentially normal at toxicity.21,22 This has been observed in
many large series, including those concerning women with
eclampsia, cyclosporine toxicity after allo-BMT, broader
PRES studies, and many isolated case reports.15,20,26-28,42
Clearly the ‘systemic process’ is sufficient to establish a state in
which neurotoxicity and the PRES imaging pattern develop.
The vasogenic edema in these patients also resolves spontane￾ously without blood pressure management. PRES, therefore,
develops and reverses in the face of systemic toxicity but in the
absence of hypertension. In addition, though moderate-to￾severe blood pressure elevation is observed in many patients
with PRES, hypertension at toxicity does not reach the upper
limit of autoregulation in most instances (mean arterial pres￾sure  150 –160 mm Hg). These are significant issues for the
hypertension/hyperperfusion hypothesis, and any theory that
attempts to postulate a mechanism in PRES must address
these observations.
Clinical/Biologic Features Common to PRES-Associated
Conditions
PRES is almost exclusively seen in the setting of a significant
systemic process/condition, including transplantation (allo￾BMT, SOT), infection/sepsis/shock, toxemia of pregnancy,
autoimmune disease, and postcancer chemotherapy.20,23 The
clinical presentation at neurotoxicity and the imaging appear￾ance of PRES are essentially the same in these conditions.13 An
important group of underlying biologic processes (Table) is
also similar and sustained in these conditions including the
following: 1) immune system activation (T-cells, related to
transplant/microorganism), 2) endothelial cell activation (en￾1044 Bartynski  AJNR 29  Jun-Jul 2008  www.ajnr.org

dothelial cell swelling, surface-marker expression, endothelin
release), 3) endothelial injury, 4) vascular instability (systemic
vasoconstriction), and 5) systemic/organ hypoperfusion in
addition to procoagulant and metabolic effects. The best char￾acterized, most familiar of these systemic conditions is tox￾emia of pregnancy.
Preeclampsia. The inciting mechanism in preeclampsia is
considered endothelial activation and injury, with numerous
systemic consequences.35,36 A prominent inflammatory cyto￾kine response is identified including the following: tumor ne￾crosis factor (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-1, interferon (IFN)-,
and IL-6. The source of cytokine release may include the pla￾centa and T-helper cells (Th1 and 2 cells); Th cell levels are
altered in preeclampsia.36 Subsequent endothelial cell activa￾tion results in endothelial cell swelling and augmented endo￾thelial surface markers including the following: E-selectin,
vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellu￾lar adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Inflammatory cytokine
levels parallel detected levels of endothelial surface markers
(VCAM-1).36 TNF- and IL-1 also up-regulate messenger ri￾bonucleic acid for the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1
and stimulate its release from endothelial cells.43-45
Diffuse endothelial activation leads to systemic vasocon￾striction, systemically labile blood pressure, and abnormal re￾sponse to vasopressors.35 Endothelial damage results in plate￾let adhesion (thrombocytopenia), platelet degranulation
(thromboxane-A2, vascular tone/blood pressure effects), he￾molysis (L-lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] elevation, schisto￾cytes), protein/fluid leakage, and systemic edema. Glomerular
endothelial swelling and dysfunction occur with magnesium,
fluid, and protein loss.35 Hepatic dysfunction from reduced
perfusion leads to elevated liver enzymes (hemolysis elevated
liver low platelets [HELLP] syndrome when coupled with he￾molysis/low platelets).35 Cerebral vasospasm and increased
vascular resistance parallel the process in other organs.40,46-50
The placenta is fetal tissue (fetal human leukocyte antigens
typing) and requires unique immune modulation to remain
isolated from the maternal circulation.36,51 Placental-mater￾nal immune reaction has been postulated.36 Anti-endothelial
cell antibodies are detected in a high percentage of eclamptic
women (50%) in comparison with healthy pregnancies
(15%).36
Allo-BMT. After allo-BMT, features develop that paral￾lel the underlying biology of preeclampsia. Acute graft-ver￾sus-host disease (GVHD) following allo-BMT is generally
related to T-cell–mediated response of graft to host (in par￾ticular to host endothelium) and a response to precondi￾tioning regimens.21,25,52,53 The preconditioning regimens
in combination with acute GVHD result in tissue injury
with cytokine release (IL-2), monocyte/macrophage activa￾tion (release of TNF-, IL-1, IFN) with resultant endothe￾lial activation (surface marker up-regulation) or inju￾ry.25,52-57 Endothelial injury is reflected in the development
of BMT thrombotic microangiopathy (BMT-TM) with
LDH elevation, schistocytes, and thrombomodulin re￾lease.21,25,58 The coagulation system is undoubtedly trig￾gered, with platelet adhesion/consumption/degranulation
(thrombocytopenia, vasoconstriction, and blood pressure
fluctuations supplemental to the endothelin). Reduced he￾patic perfusion and hepatic injury develop, with elevated
liver enzymes (veno-occlusive disease, similar to
preeclampsia).
Transplant tolerance is aided by immunosuppression (cy￾closporine/tacrolimus), limiting acute GVHD and graft rejec￾tion. The effects of cyclosporine/tacrolimus and problems re￾lated to transplantation often coexist.59,60 Acute GVHD has
been labeled a “distortion of the cellular response” to infec￾tion.55 Cyclosporine induces diffuse endothelial injury with
systemic effects.61 Vasoconstriction develops (endothelin,
sympathetic) with altered glomerular filtration, glomerular
endothelial injury, proteinuria, and magnesium loss (resem￾bling preeclampsia).59,62Chronic renal interstitial changes oc￾cur with prolonged exposure.
Chronic GVHD (a condition that resembles scleroderma
or lupus) appears to be related to the development of autoan￾tibodies (antiendothelial and antiphospholipid antibodies)
similar to autoimmune diseases.63
Infection/Sepsis/Shock. Observations in infection/sepsis/
shock are similar.37,64 The septic/shock response likely reflects
systemic toxicity similar to systemic inflammatory response
syndrome or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and
bacteremia, or endotoxins/exotoxins are considered potential
triggers.64-66 Cytokine response (TNF-, IL-1) plays a critical
role in development of this effect.67,68

Endothelial activation and injury are considered central to
the development of the primary infection response and sec￾ondary septic response.64,69-71 Inflammatory cytokine release
(TNF-, IL-1) leads to endothelial activation with endothe￾lial cell swelling, up-regulation of surface antigens (P-selectin,
E-selectin, ICAM-1) with increased leukocyte adherence, al￾tered vascular tone, altered vascular permeability, and coagu￾lation.64,71-73 Microcirculatory dysfunction develops due, in
part, to leukocyte adherence and tissue migration (trafficking)
with reduced tissue capillary/venule blood flow.72 Altered vas￾cular tone secondary to competing vasoconstrictive (platelet
degranulation [thromboxane release], endothelin-1, angio￾tensin, vasopressin, central sympathetic stimulation) and va￾sodilatory (nitric oxide, prostacycline) effects are noted.73 Sig￾nificant vascular instability is seen in 50% of patients with
sepsis.74 TNF- and IL-1 up-regulate and stimulate the release
of endothelin-1,43-45 and endothelin-1 is released at high levels
in sepsis.37,75 Endotoxin also promotes endothelin release.76
Gram-positive organisms are commonly seen in infection/
sepsis/shock–associated PRES.37 The mechanism of gram￾positive sepsis is unique, with cell surface antigen and super￾antigen T-cell stimulation of cytokine release, compared with
traditional T-cell trigger occurring with gram-negative organ￾isms.64,77-79 Superantigens demonstrate a marked interaction
rate with the overall T-cell population (5%–20% of T-cells for
superantigens versus 1 in 104
–106 T-cells for traditional anti￾gen) with broad T-cell stimulation/cytokine response.64,78
SOTs. In SOT, several processes are observed, including
acute and chronic organ rejection, infections, and microchi￾merism secondary to circulation of transplanted organ im￾mune cells. Graft rejection following SOT is related to a T-cell
response to the graft along with the development of antivas￾cular or antiendothelial antibodies (primarily against the
transplant).80,81 Acute rejection also involves up-regulation of
T-cells and the endothelium. Leukocyte trafficking occurs in
the transplant with inflammatory cell adhesion. Altered per￾fusion develops due to trafficking and the ongoing inflamma￾tory response.
Late rejection (as in kidney transplants) generally involves
CD4 T-cell activation to transplant endothelium with delayed￾type hypersensitivity response (including TNF- and -, IFN-,
and IL-1 cytokine expression) and progressive cytotoxic CD8 T￾cell activation with direct endothelial/tissue injury.80 The inflam￾matory response to the graft leads to endothelial adhesion mole￾cule activation, leukocyte trafficking (T-cells,macrophages, other
leukocytes), and organ hypoperfusion. Chemokine activation of
neutrophils develops, and B-cell activation with antibody pro￾duction can also occur. This chronic allograft inflammatory pro￾cess results in the organ/stromal injury, which constitutes the his￾tologically observed effects of rejection.80
Chemotherapy and Cancer. Immunologic reaction to
cancer cells is well recognized.82 Potential triggers include: 1)
CD8 T-cell recognition of unique tumor antigens expressed
on tumor cell major histocompatibility complex type-I
(MHC-I) molecules or 2) CD4 T-cell recognition of unique
tumor antigens expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC; ie
dendritic cells or macrophages) MHC-II molecules.
PRES typically occurs several weeks after cancer chemo￾therapy23 and tumor cell lysis, APC tumor antigen expression,
CD4 T-cell activation and monocyte/macrophage activa￾tion likely develops with subsequent cytokine expression.82
Increased recognition of PRES with higher doses of chemo￾therapy could reflect immune response to unique tumor anti￾gen and/or the direct effects of chemotherapy on the endothe￾lial cell.23,25
Microchimeric Conditions
“Microchimerism” is a condition in which blood cell popula￾tions of different genetic composition coexist. The hallmark is
allo-BMT, but this state may exist in SOT (in particular liver
transplants), preeclampsia, and autoimmune disease.
Liver Transplants. The donor liver contains a significant
number of mobile and intrinsic (Kupffer) immunologically
active cells.83 A large pool of T-cells/macrophages/stem cells
present in the donor liver exits in the first 45 days posttrans￾plantation, interacting with the recipient or establishing per￾manent residence within the host.83 Mechanisms similar to
allo-BMT (GVHD effect) could contribute to PRES, typically
seen early after liver transplantation.25
Preeclampsia. The placenta is not a fully restrictive mater￾nal-fetal barrier. Exchange of fetal blood with the maternal
circulation occurs, particular at delivery (Rh exchange). Fetal
leukocytes and DNA can be detected in the maternal circula￾tion as early as 4 –5 weeks into the pregnancy, increase during
the course of the pregnancy, and can persist in the maternal
circulation as long as 27 years after delivery.84,85 Preliminary
studies suggest the presence of preeclampsia, and the severity
of preeclampsia may, in part, be related to the quantity of
fetal-maternal cell exchange during the pregnancy.86
Autoimmune Diseases. Scleroderma, systemic lupus ery￾thematosus (SLE), and Wegener’s granulomatosis share rec￾ognized underlying histopathology traditionally labeled
vasculitis.
In scleroderma, endothelial activation and cytokine pro￾duction result in stimulation of systemic collagen deposition/
fibrosis.87 A high number of fetal Y-chromosome leukocytes
have recently been demonstrated in the characteristic skin le￾sions and blood of women with scleroderma, apparently re￾lated to prior pregnancy (microchimersim).88,89 The features
of chronic GVHD resemble those of scleroderma,63 and mod￾els of chronic GVHD are commonly used to study sclero￾derma and SLE.90,91
SLE is caused by incorrect Th cell control over B-cell func￾tion, with the errant production of self-antibodies or autoan￾tibodies.92 Build-up of antigen-antibody complexes results in
vascular/endothelial injury/activation with multiorgan tissue
injury and potential inflammatory cell attraction.
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis that
affects the kidney, lung, and other organs such as the sinonasal
region, skin, and brain.93 The specific trigger remains elusive,
but prominent cytokine release is recognized (TNF-) along
with extensive autoantibody production (antineutrophilic cy￾toplasmic antibody) and potential antigen-antibody stimula￾tion of neutrophil degranulation and endothelial injury.
Overall Observations in PRES-Associated Conditions
In the majority of patients who develop PRES, therefore, a
complex underlying ‘systemic process’ is present with similar
underlying biologic features (Table). T-cell activation and in￾flammatory cytokine production (TNF-, IL-1, IFN-, and
1046 Bartynski  AJNR 29  Jun-Jul 2008  www.ajnr.org

IL-6) are common. Cytokines (TNF-, IL-1) up-regulate en￾dothelial surface antigens (P-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1,
VCAM-1), and increased leukocyte adherence (trafficking)
leading to microcirculatory dysfunction. Endothelial injury is
noted with thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, and increased
LDH. Endothelial activation and injury likely result in vascu￾lopathy with altered intrinsic vascular tone from platelet ag￾gregation, inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-, IL-1),
cyclosporine/tacrolimus, or endotoxin (ie, vasoconstriction
[endothelin-1, thromboxane-A2] and vasodilation [nitric ox￾ide, prostacycline]). Enhanced systemic endothelial activation
(swelling), leukocyte trafficking, and vasoconstriction, alone
or in combination, would result in brain and systemic
hypoperfusion.
Evidence of Hypoperfusion in PRES
An evolving systemic process with hypoperfusion/vasocon￾striction and the development of parallel brain and systemic
toxicity would more easily explain most of the observations in
PRES.
Vasculopathy. Evidence of vasculopathy has been demon￾strated in PRES, and the features reflect elements of vasocon￾striction, vasodilation, and reduced perfusion as suggested
from the common underlying biology described previously.
CA and MRA demonstrate focal vasoconstriction, focal vaso￾dilation, string-of-beads appearance, and vessel pruning, un￾doubtedly reflecting endothelial dysfunction (increased and
decreased vessel tone) or reduced flow.21,24,37,40,46,47,94-96 Dif￾fuse vasoconstriction is also present.24 These features have
been noted in hypertensive as well as nonhypertensive patients
and have been shown to reverse.
The PRES imaging pattern resembles a watershed distribu￾tion, further suggesting hypoperfusion, which has been dem￾onstrated by technetium Tc99m HMPAO SPECT and
MRP.24,31,32,97 In addition, increased brain vascular resistance
and cerebral vasospasm are suggested in preeclampsia/
eclampsia by transcranial Doppler.48-50
Vasogenic Edema. Sustained hypoperfusion could ex￾plain the vasogenic edema in PRES. Toxicity-related hypo￾perfusion or vasoconstriction could lead to localized brain
hypoxia. Hypoxia activates endothelial cells and stimulates
angiogenesis.98-100 Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF, previously called vascular permeability factor) is
up-regulated in this setting due to tissue expression of hy￾poxemia-inducible factor 1 in the presence of hypox￾emia.101,102 With hypoxia, VEGF levels increase progres￾sively for 6 –24 hours and act on endothelial cells to
stimulate angiogenesis and increase endothelial permeabil￾ity.101,102 The increased permeability appears threshold-de￾pendent, occurring with increasing VEGF levels and requir￾ing moderate-to-severe hypoxemia (pO2  8%) and is
blocked by anti-VEGF antibodies.101 Acidic extracellular
pH 6.6 also increases VEGF levels, and brain proton spec￾troscopy has occasionally demonstrated lactate in
PRES.103,104 Permeability changes may relate to altered ad￾hesion characteristics between endothelial cell tight junc￾tions.98 Systemic VEGF levels increase in preeclampsia.35
Brain Edema and Systemic Hypertension
If the cause of PRES is related to systemic toxicity, the quantity
of brain edema will undoubtedly relate to features of the toxic
process, including severity, duration, and regional brain vas￾cular specificity. Recent evidence suggests that brain edema in
PRES is reduced, not greater, in patients with severe hyperten￾sion.24,37,38 If the underlying process is a systemic inflamma￾tory response with resultant hypoperfusion, augmented sys￾temic vasoconstriction and augmented hypertension may
occur, representing a Cushing-like response, designed to in￾crease perfusion and reverse brain hypoxemia. The role of
hypertension may be that of a modulator in PRES.
With increasing hypertension, autoregulation could play a
supplemental role, further modifying cerebral blood flow. Au￾toregulatory vasoconstriction superimposed on toxicity￾induced brain vasoconstriction could further reduce brain
perfusion and induce ischemia. Toxicity-blood-pressure re￾duction might lead to reduced autoregulatory vasoconstric￾tion, improved perfusion, reversal of a watershed penumbra,
and subsequent clinical improvement. Vasodilators and cal￾cium channel blockers are commonly used antihypertensive
agents in PRES, and apparent clinical recovery may be aug￾mented by improved cerebral blood flow.12,13,105
Magnesium Revisited
It has been suggested that hypomagnesemia may be associated
with and may augment PRES (cyclosporine neurotoxicity).106
Magnesium wasting is well known in preeclampsia, due to
glomerular dysfunction, and after transplantation, due to the
effects of cyclosporine/tacrolimus on glomerular endotheli￾um.35,59 Magnesium is a competitive antagonist to calcium. It
reverses cerebral vasoconstriction in laboratory animals and
preeclamptics and is currently under study as a potential an￾tivasospasm treatment after subarachnoid hemorrhage.107-109
Although neural suppression is often suggested as the ‘antisei￾zure’ mechanism of action of magnesium sulfate,35 its effect in
preeclampsia could, in reality, be vasodilation with “PRES
prevention”. Of note, PRES has been observed in the setting of
hypercalcemia.23
Summary of Systemic Toxicity with Hypoperfusion in
PRES
The major clinical conditions that develop PRES demonstrate
a similar clinical presentation, imaging appearance, and un￾derlying biology. Toxicity occurs in the absence of hyperten￾sion, but elevated blood pressure may have a modulating ef￾fect. Immune system (T-cell) activation, endothelial cell
activation and injury, and an inflammatory cytokine response
predominate, with hypoperfusion intrinsic to these condi￾tions, due to either leukocyte trafficking or vasoconstriction.
Evidence of vasculopathy and cerebral hypoperfusion is
present on most current imaging studies and is likely reflected
in the watershed appearance of the vasogenic edema that de￾velops in PRES. Parallel clinical, imaging, and underlying bi￾ology between preeclampsia and transplantation support an
immune cause of placental intolerance.36
Conclusions
The mechanism of PRES remains controversial. Although the
hypertension/hyperperfusion theory is favored due to the
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 29:1043– 49  Jun-Jul 2008  www.ajnr.org 1047

common presence of elevated toxicity blood pressure and per￾ceived response to hypertension management, key issues re￾main problematic, including PRES in normotensives, toxicity
pressures rarely reaching autoregulatory limits, and brain
edema lower in severe hypertensives. Hypertensive encepha￾lopathy animal models do not reflect the systemic toxicity
present, and hyperperfusion has not conclusively been dem￾onstrated in patients.
Systemic toxicity leading to endothelial dysfunction with sub￾sequent vasoconstriction or leukocyte trafficking or both appear
to address the observations more comprehensively. Common
underlying physiology/pathology in PRES-associated conditions,
reversible vasculopathy identified at CA/MRA, and hypoperfu￾sion as noted on most SPECT/MRP studies could lead to VEFG
up-regulation and could better explain the watershed appearance
on CT/MR imaging. Autoregulatory vasoconstriction superim￾posed on toxicity vasoconstriction/hypoperfusion with border￾zone ischemia could be responding to antihypertensive/magne￾sium management, leading to perceived clinical improvement.
Further investigations will be necessary to bring clarity and con￾firm the mechanism.
