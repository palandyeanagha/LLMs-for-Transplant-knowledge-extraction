Abstract
Vascular calcification can occur in nearly all arterial beds and in both the medial and intimal
layers. The initiating factors and clinical consequences depend on the underlying disease state and
the location of the calcification. The best studied manifestation is coronary artery calcification, in
part because of the obvious clinical consequences, but also because of CT based imaging
modalities. In the general population, the presence of coronary artery calcification increases
cardiovascular risk above that predicted by traditional Framingham risk factors, suggesting the
presence of non-traditional risk factors. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) coronary
artery calcification is more prevalent and markedly more severe than in the general population. In
these CKD patients, non-traditional risk factors such as oxidative stress, advanced glycation end￾products and disordered mineral metabolism are also more prevalent and more severe and offer
mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of vascular calcification.

Introduction
Calcium is the most common element in bone, and 99% of the total body calcium is in bone
in the form of a calcium phosphate crystalline structure called hydroxyapatite. Calcium is
also found outside of bone in a variety of tissues, broadly termed extra-skeletal calcification.
In these sites, the calcium can be in multiple forms- including hydroxyapatite, magnesium
whitlockite, and amorphous calcium phosphate. Calcification in arteries, or vascular
calcification, can lead to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1]. While cellular necrosis
may lead to calcium deposition within or around vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),
over the last 15 years there has been an increased appreciation that vascular calcification is a
cell-mediated process. Indeed, the majority of vascular calcification is thought to be

purposely laid down by vascular smooth muscle cells that have de-differentiated to
osteoblast/chondrocyte like cells.
Pathophysiology
Arterial calcification can occur in both intimal and medial layers. In the intima,
atherosclerotic disease is characterized by fibrofatty plaque formation, and based on autopsy
data and animal models. Calcification had been thought to occur late in the disease course.
However, using intravascular ultrasound, the atherosclerosis can also be a circumferential
lesion (without an obstructed lumen) with calcification earlier in the course of the disease
[2]. The medial layer may also be affected, leading to thickening of the medial layer of
larger elastic arteries resulting in arteriosclerosis of smaller elastic arteries classically
described as Mönckeberg’s calcification, or medial calcinosis[3, 4]. This disease of small
vessels is more common in patients with diabetes, renal failure and advanced aging and is
associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients without
CKD[5], and in CKD patients with and without diabetes
The clinical manifestations of vascular calcification depend on the location within the
arterial wall and the tissue perfused. Intimal, atherosclerotic calcification can lead to
myocardial infarction from stenosis and acute thrombus, or ischemia in both coronary and
peripheral arteries. Medial or circumferential calcification can lead to reduced compliance
due to arterial stiffening, resulting in an impaired vasodilation during ischemia that, in
theory could lead to arrhythmias and sudden death. With medial calcification
(arteriosclerosis) of the aorta, there will be increased pulse wave velocity, elevated pulse
pressure, and systolic hypertension. Lastly, calcification of the arterioles of the skin and
other organs can lead to calciphylaxis and ischemic gut[7]. Arterial calcification can be
detected by plain radiographs, CT methods including EBCT and multi-slice (spiral) CT, and
ultrasound. Unfortunately, with the exception of intravascular ultrasound, none of these
techniques can distinguish intimal from medial calcification. CT based methods are utilized
for clinical research as they allow for quantitation. The higher the coronary artery
calcification score, the greater the risk of cardiovascular mortality in both the general
population[8] and in chronic kidney disease (CKD)[9].
Age is the strongest predictor of coronary artery disease[8] but multiple other clinical risk
factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of arterial calcification. Coronary artery
calcification is also more prevalent and more severe among CKD patients than in the general
population, and studies in CKD patients offer insight into the pathogenesis. In patients not
yet on dialysis, over 50% have coronary artery calcification[10] whereas 70–90% of
prevalent dialysis patients have significant coronary artery calcification[11, 12]. Histologic
studies comparing dialysis patients to non-CKD patients who died of a coronary event
showed that dialysis patients had more calcification in the atheromatous plaques, but not
more plaque. Dialysis patients also had a thicker medial layer [13]. Studies evaluating distal
segments of the coronary arteries found medial calcification adjacent to the internal elastic
lamina in dialysis patients [14] and in patients with advanced CKD[15]. We found isolated
medial calcification in the absence of intimal calcification in the inferior epigastric artery of
patients undergoing a renal transplant[16]. Thus, calcification can occur both in intimal and
medial arterial layers and in different vascular beds. In a study of 4544 patients, the presence
of calcification in the thoracic aorta, carotids and iliac arteries were associated with all-cause
mortality with hazard ratios of 2.1, 1.6, and 1.67, respectively, whereas coronary artery
calcification was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.4 for cardiovascular mortality[17]. At
the present time, it appears that there may be different initiating factors in different vascular
beds and in the intima and media, but a common downstream process of de-differentiation to
an osteoblast like phenotype.

The mechanism of arterial calcification is complex, but multiple investigators agree that the
first step appears to be de-differentiation or transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC) to an osteoblast/chondrocytic phenotype (Figure 1). VSMC originate from a
similar mesenchymal stem cell as osteoblasts, the latter occurring with upregulation of the
transcription factor core binding factor alpha-1 (Cbfa-1) now called Runt-related
transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) or msh homeobox 2 (MSX-2). These cells then do what a
normal osteoblast does: secrete matrix proteins. We have shown that there is increased
expression of RUNX2 by in situ hybridization in areas adjacent to calcification of the intima
and the medial layer of inferior epigastric artery obtained from hemodialysis patients in
association with ‘bone’ matrix proteins[16]. The signals that induce this transformation are
multiple and will be described in detail below. Once the matrix is laid down, these cells then
mineralize the matrix through the secretion of matrix vesicles [18], or through apoptosis[19].
Phosphorus and calcium increase the mineralizing potential of these matrix vesicles[18, 20].
The latter may explain why the disease is increased in CKD where disturbances of mineral
metabolism are common and why there may be a relationship between bone mineralization
and coronary calcification [21]. In both bone and arteries, there are inhibitors of calcification
including matrix gla protein, pyrophosphate, and osteopontin and circulating inhibitors such
as fetuin-A[22]. Thus, calcification is a balance between pro-mineralizing factors that
stimulate VSMC de-differentiation and inhibitors of calcification. For the remainder of this
review we will focus on the pro-mineralizing factors.
Risk Factors
Vascular calcification can occur with either atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis, both of which
are increased with so-called “traditional” Framingham risk factors. Thus, many clinical
series have tried to find associations with such risk factors with coronary artery or peripheral
artery calcification. Everhart showed that risk factors for arterial calcification were impaired
vibration, duration of diabetes, and high plasma glucose[23]. Patients with diabetes have
increased coronary artery calcification, and the presence of diabetic nephropathy increases
this risk[10, 24]. Lehto et al, in a study of 1059 patients with type II diabetes, demonstrated
that medial arterial calcification of peripheral arteries was a strong independent predictor of
total cardiovascular mortality, and also a significant predictor of future coronary heart
disease events, stroke and amputation[5]. In contrast, dyslipidemia in the form of elevated
LDL cholesterol does not seem to play a role in the coronary artery calcification in patients
with CKD[25] whereas non-HDL cholesterol, but not LDL cholesterol, was associated with
increased coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic adults without CKD[26].
Importantly, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that statins improve atherosclerotic
diseases, but have no effect on the reduction of coronary artery calcification [27]. Similarly,
hypertension and smoking are not consistently identified risk factors for coronary artery
calcification.
Clinically, the presence of calcification by EBCT increases the risk of mortality above that
predicted by traditional “Framingham” risk factors. The presence of coronary calcification
increases the area under the curve compared to traditional risk factors (0.84 vs 0.71,
respectively, P <.001)[28]. In patients with CKD, there is a progressive increase in coronary
artery calcification with loss of renal function, independent of traditional risk factors[29].
Multiple studies have demonstrated the added value of coronary artery calcification
assessment on risk prediction including the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA)
[30], Rotterdam[31], South Bay Heart Watch[32], and Heinz Nixdorf Recall[33]. The reader
is referred to an excellent recent systematic review on this topic[34]. The remainder of this
review focuses on animal and in vitro data examining some of the traditional and
nontraditional risk factors associated with increased vascular calcification (Table 1).

“Traditional” risk factors for vascular calcification
Hypertension
Hypertension is associated with vascular remodeling and arteriosclerosis. In clinical studies,
hypertension is not a commonly cited risk factor for calcification, perhaps because the
majority of subjects with calcification have hypertension as a clinical manifestation of the
arteriosclerosis. The renin-angiotensin system is known to be a major pathogenic factor in
VSMC apoptosis, growth and differentiation, and therefore it likely plays a role in
calcification[35]. Armstrong et al fed rabbits an atherogenic diet with high dose vitamin D to
induce calcification along the internal elastic lamina and the media layer. There was
upregulation of BMP-2 and down regulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin suggesting a de￾differentiation from a vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype to an osteoblast like
phenotype. Furthermore, calcified arteries had upregulation of angiotensin 1 receptor and
treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker prevented the calcification[36]. In contrast, in
5/6th nephrectomized rats (a model of CKD), treatment with enalapril improved myocardial
hypertrophy and progression of renal disease but had no effect on vascular calcification[37].
In a rat model of arterial calcification induced by intramuscular administration of vitamin D
plus oral nicotine (VDN), increased calcium content of arteries was associated with
increased levels of angiotensin II and adlosterone in the tissue; treatment with captopril or
spironolactone reduced the calcification[38]. Thus, the renin-angiotensin and aldosterone
pathway appears to play a role in arterial calcification. Whether this is due to the reduction
of underlying remodeling (arteriosclerosis), or a direct inhibition of the osteogenic
transformation will require additional studies.
Diabetes
Our laboratory examined the calcification and expression of ‘bone’ proteins in the inferior
epigastric artery of patients undergoing a renal transplant. Patients with diabetes had
increased calcification compared to non-diabetic patients and there was increased expression
in the medial layer of bone matrix proteins in the arteries such as osteopontin, type I
collagen and alkaline phosphatase[39]. In vitro, we have found that VSMC incubated with
high glucose led to an increase in the expression of the osteoblast transcription factor
RUNX2, BMP-2 and osteocalcin and enhanced calcification in bovine VSMC. The protein
kinase C signaling pathway was involved in this high glucose-induced expression of
RUNX2 and bone matrix proteins[39]. Another group found that when fed high fat diet, the
Ldlr−/− diabetic mouse develops hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and aortic calcification with
concomitant upregulation of aortic BMP2 and Msx2 gene expression[40]. Increased glucose
increased the BMP-2/Msx2-Wnt pathway, leading to an osteogenic phenotype in a subset of
the myofibroblasts; inhibition of the BMP-2 pathway reduced arterial calcification[41].
Interestingly, the location of BMP2 and BMP4 differed in diabetic aortas in that BMP-4 was
found in the endothelium and BMP2 throughout the vascular wall[41]. These results suggest
that the increased vascular calcification in diabetes is at least partially due to the direct
effects of hyperglycemia on transforming the VSMC to osteoblast like phenotype via
multiple mechanisms.
Dyslipidemia
Although clinically the role of lipids in vascular calcification is unclear, during osteogenic
differentiation, calcifying vascular cells (CVCs, a clone of VSMC that readily calcify)
accumulate not only minerals but also lipids such as triglycerides[42]. In vitro, HDL inhibits
the osteogenic differentiation pathway[42]. In CVCs, stearate, compared to other fatty acids,
promoted mineralization whereas inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or acyl-CoA
synthetase reduced mineralization[43]. In these same CVC, n-3 unsaturated fatty acids play
a protective role through a p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PPARγ

(peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) dependent mechanism[44]. Finally,
oxidized lipids such as oxysterols and oxidized phospholipids illicit procalcific effects in
vascular cells as detailed below [45]. Thus, dyslipidemia, rather than elevated LDL
cholesterol appears to be a major causative factor in vascular calcification.
Non- traditional risk factors
Inflammation
Inflammation is a known non-traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis and vascular disease
in the normal population and in CKD and is associated with increased mortality[46, 47].
Both CRP [48] and inflammatory cytokines[49] are associated with increased coronary
artery calcification in patients with CKD. Interestingly, osteogenesis is associated with local
inflammation and macrophage infiltration in atherosclerosis in ApoE −/− mice as revealed
by molecular imaging in vivo [50]. Tumor necrosis factor alpha can induce mineralization of
calcifying vascular cells in vitro [51] and co-culture of these cells with monocyte/
macrophages (the source of most cytokines) can accelerate mineralization [52]. In human
VSMC, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt pathway may inhibit inflammation
induced calcification, perhaps by mediating alkaline phosphatase which is a ‘marker’ of
osteoblast phenotype but also a potent inhibitor of a naturally occurring inhibitor of
calcification, pyrophosphate[53]. Cytokine stimulation of alkaline phosphatase from
VSMCs probably plays an important role also in calcification associated with diabetes, since
the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab was shown to reduce the osteogenic phenotype of VSMC
and the extent of medial calcification in LDLR −/− diabetic mice, without reducing obesity,
hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia[40].
Oxidative Stress—CKD is a state of increased oxidative stress due to impaired anti￾oxidative mechanisms[54]. Elevations in asymmetric dimethylarginine, a naturally occurring
inhibitor of NO synthase, are associated with increased intima-medial thickness in the
carotid arteries, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality in dialysis
patients[55]. In a rat model of CKD, the antioxidant Tempol inhibited vascular calcification
by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting osteogenic transdifferentiation of vascular
smooth muscle cells[56]. In the general population, there is growing evidence indicates that
there is a correlation between oxidative stress and the development of vascular
calcification[57–60]. Macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells produce
reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion in response to a
number of stimuli. The free radical nitric oxide (NO) is generated from the endothelium
from L -arginine by the enzyme NO synthase and leads to production of hydroxyl or peroxyl
radicals. When VSMC are treated with β-glycerophosphate or uremic serum for 24 h, the
production of H2O2 and early expression of NADPH oxidase sub-unit p22(phox) are
increased. The elevated oxidative stress was associated with increased expression of
RUNX2 and alkaline phosphatase and calcification of VSMC[57]. An important contributor
to oxidative stress in atherosclerotic lesions is the formation of hydrogen peroxide from
various sources in vascular cells[58]. A recent study by Byon et al[60] demonstrated that
H2O2 induces a switch of VSMC from contractile to osteogenic phenotype associated with
an increased expression of RUNX2 and calcification in VSMC. Furthermore, inhibition of
H2O2-activated AKT signaling pathways blocked increased expression of RUNX2 and
VSMC calcification[60]. A similar study has also demonstrated that advanced oxidation
protein products (AOPPs) induce vascular calcification by promoting osteoblast
differentiation of human vascular smooth muscle cells via the ERK signaling pathway[59].
In a rabbit model of atherogenesis fed high dose vitamin D, there was increased oxidative
stress and aortic valve (AV) calcification/stenosis. The latter could be abrogated by the
antioxidant lipoic acid[58]. Lipid oxidation products have direct effects on both bone￾Chen and Moe Page 5

forming and bone-resorbing cells. Oxidized LDL directly inhibits differentiation of
osteoblasts[45] while directly inducing differentiation of osteoclasts[61]. Oxidized lipids
also regulate osteoclastogenic cytokines produced by osteoblasts[62]. Thus, oxidative stress
may be causative in vascular calcification, and may also explain the relationship between
increased coronary artery calcification and osteoporosis found in both CKD and the general
population[63].
Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs)—Proteins can be modified indirectly by
reactive carbonyl compounds formed by auto-oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids, leading
to eventual formation of AGEs. AGEs have been found in arterial and cardiac tissue as well
as atherosclerotic lesions in dialysis patients[64]. Circulating AGEs such as pentosidine are
elevated in patients on dialysis[65]. AGE-modified elastin and calcification has been found
to co-localize in the aortic media of dialysis patients and binding of mineral to elastin is
thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of medial calcification [66]. In cultured
VSMC, AGEs can accelerate calcification of microvascular pericytes[67]. AGEs induced
the expression of RUNX2 mRNA and alkaline phosphatase activity and calcification[68].
The receptor for AGE (RAGE) is expressed in a variety of cells including VSMC[69] and
these AGE mediated changes in VSMCs were partially attenuated by a neutralizing antibody
to RAGE[70]. A study by Suga et al[71] demonstrated that activation of RAGE inhibited
VSMC phenotypic gene expression and induces osteogenic differentiation of VSMC. This
RAGE mediated effect was via Notch/Msx2 induction in VSMC. The results suggest that
AGEs that accumulate in diabetes could elicit the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs,
thereby contributing to vascular calcification via the RAGE pathway.
Abnormal mineral metabolism
Hyperphosphatemia—Abnormal mineral metabolism has been recognized as a
nontraditional risk factor in the development of vascular calcification in CKD patients and is
associated with increased mortality in both pre-dialysis and dialysis patients[1, 72].
Hyperphosphatemia is associated with the prevalence and progression of vascular
calcification in dialysis patients[73]. Several studies have demonstrated that the use of non￾calcium-based as compared with calcium-based phosphate binders attenuated vascular
calcification and mortality in dialysis patients[9, 74]. In the general population, phosphorus
levels in the upper quartile of the normal range are also associated with increased
cardiovascular and all cause mortality[75].
In vitro, phosphate increased the calcification of VSMC in dose-dependent manner[76].
High phosphate induced the loss of VSMC markers, such as smooth muscle (SM) alpha￾actin and SM22α and increased the expression of the osteochondrogenic markers Runx2,
osterix, osteopontin, and alkaline phosphatase[77, 78]. We have demonstrated that bovine
VSMC incubated with calcification media (10 mM β-glycerolphosphate as a phosphate
donor) generated cellular matrix vesicles that have high annexin II and VI content and the
ability to mineralize extracellular matrix compared to that from bovine VSMC incubated
without phosphate[18]. The matrix vesicles serve as nucleation sites for calcification, similar
to the vesicles that bud from osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes in normal bone
formation. Phosphate transport to cells is primarily mediated by sodium-dependent
phosphate (NaPi) co-transporters[79] and treatment with phosphonoformic acid (PFA, a
competitive inhibitor of NaPi transport) inhibits phosphate uptake and VSMC
osteochondrogenic differentiation[76]. The type III NaPi co-transporters, PiT-1, is highly
expressed in VSMC[80] and the knockdown PiT-1 with siRNA suppressed phosphate￾induced calcification and blocked induction of the osteogenic markers Runx2/Cbfa1 and
osteopontin[80]. However, our group has shown that bovine VSMCs incubated with pooled
uremic sera from dialysis patients had increased calcification, above that induced by

phosphorus but only when phosphorus is available[81]. The addition of PFA (inhibitor of
NaPi transport) or levamisole (inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase) only partially inhibited
uremic serum-induced osteopontin upregulation. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP)/protein kinase A signaling pathway was involved in uremic serum-induced
upregulation of RUNX2 and alkaline phosphatase[82]. High phosphate may also regulate
matrix mineralization through elastin degradation. A soluble elastin-derived peptide can
induce mineralization of human VSMCs in the presence of high phosphorus
concentration[83]. Treatment of rat VSMC with elastin peptide induced the expression of
elastin–laminin receptors along with increased expression of osteoblastic transcription factor
RUNX2 and alkaline phosphatase[84]. TGF-β which is known to upregulate RUNX2[85],
had synergistic effect on VSMC phenotypic change. In a rat aortic ring model, treatment
with high phosphate and warfarin increased matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity
followed by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and aortic calcification[86]. We
have recently demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity are increased
with progressive CKD, and blockade of MMP activity can inhibit arterial calcification[87].
This matrix degradation or alteration may be an initial step in calcification.
Hypercalcemia—There is an association with elevated serum calcium and the
development of vascular calcification in the CKD population [72]. In addition, the use of
calcium containing phosphate binders which induce positive calcium balance is associated
with increased arterial calcification in the majority of studies[88]. In vitro, calcium alone can
increase human VSMCs calcification[89]. Furthermore, calcium and phosphorus had
synergistic roles in inducing mineralization of VSMC[90]. In an aorta ring culture model,
elevated calcium was more potent than phosphorus to induce VSMC calcification for a
given concentration of calcium and phosphorus, called the Ca × P product[91] [92]. Calcium
also stimulates VSMC matrix vesicle release [90]. We have demonstrated that calcified
VSMC derived cellular MV are enriched with annexin II and VI but with little fetuin-A[18].
Furthermore, blockade of annexin calcium channel activity with K201or the L-type calcium
channel blocker verapamil significantly inhibit MV activity and the calcification of VSMC
[20]. Shanahan and colleagues also demonstrated that blockade of intracellular calcium
increase can inhibit MV calcification[93]. It is clear that abnormal mineral metabolism
contributes to the development of vascular calcification by multiple mechanisms.
FGF23: The hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is predominately expressed in
osteocytes and is involved in mineral homeostasis by inducing hyperphosphaturia, inhibiting
calcitriol synthesis and inhibiting PTH secretion[94]. In the kidney it exerts its biological
functions by binding to the FGF receptor in the presence of the cofactor Klotho[95]. Several
studies have demonstrated that FGF23 is associated with coronary artery and aortic vascular
calcification in CKD and dialysis patients[96, 97]. Targeted deletion of FGF23 or Klotho in
mice resulted in hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification[95, 98]. In moderately
uremic mice fed high-phosphate diets, elevated serum FGF-23 and osteopontin levels, but
not serum phosphorus levels, were associated with extensive arterial-medial
calcifications[99]. A recent study by Takei et al has demonstrated that the expression of
stanniocalcin (STC) 2, a calcium/phosphate-regulating hormone, is increased and co￾localized in calcified lesions of FGF23 or Klotho null mice[100]. Although the mechanism
by which FGF23 affects vascular calcification is not clear at present, these data suggest that
another mechanism by which phosphate affects vascular calcification may be through
phosphorus-mediated elevation of FGF-23 levels.
In conclusion
CKD represents a model of accelerated vascular calcification and provides insight into the
pathogenesis of arterial calcification and the importance of non-traditional risk factors.

Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate to adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and
vascular smooth muscle cells. The latter cells can also de-differentiate or transform to
chondrocyte/osteoblast like cells by upregulation of transcription factors such as RUNX-2
and MSX2. These cells then lay down collagen and non-collagenous proteins in the intima
or media AND incorporate calcium and phosphorus into matrix vesicles to initiate
mineralization and further grow the mineral into hydroxyapatite. The overall positive
calcium and phosphorus balance of most dialysis patients feeds both the cellular
