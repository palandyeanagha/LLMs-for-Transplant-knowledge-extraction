Abstract
Objective: To assess the tolerance and efficacy of rituximab in
patients with various autoimmune diseases seen in daily
rheumatological practice.
Methods: 866 rheumatology and internal medicine practitioners
were contacted by email to obtain the files of patients treated with
rituximab for systemic autoimmune diseases. Patients with
lymphoma were analysed if the evolution of the autoimmune
disease could be evaluated.
Results: In all, 43 of 49 cases could be analysed, including 14 with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 13 with systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), six with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), five with
systemic vasculitis, and five with other autoimmune diseases.
Rituximab was prescribed for lymphoma in two patients with RA
and two with pSS. In the 39 other cases, rituximab was given
because of the refractory character of the autoimmune disease. The
mean follow up period was 8.3 months (range 2 to 26). There were
11 adverse events in 10 patients and treatment had to be
discontinued in six. Efficacy was observed in 30 patients (70%): RA
11, SLE 9, pSS 5, vasculitis 2, antisynthetase syndromes 2,
sarcoidosis 1. The mean decrease in corticosteroid intake was 9.5


mg/d (range 0 to 50) in responders. Seven patients experienced
relapse after mean 8.1 months (5 to 15). Three patients died
because of refractory autoimmune disease.
Conclusions: Despite absence of marketing authorisation,
rituximab is used to treat various refractory autoimmune diseases in
daily rheumatological practice. This study showed good tolerance
and short term clinical efficacy, with marked corticosteroid
reduction in patients with SLE, pSS, vasculitis, and polymyositis.
