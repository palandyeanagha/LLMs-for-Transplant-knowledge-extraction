A 56-year-old male presented with severe exertional dyspnea and pitting edema in the lower extremities. The pre￾operative evaluation demonstrated biventricular dysfunction associated with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation and a 
persistent left superior vena cava. He was registered as a transplantation candidate, and orthotopic heart trans￾plantation was performed using the standard bicaval technique. The left superior vena cava was connected to the 
right atrial appendage after the construction of a conduit using the recipient’s autologous coronary sinus tissue. 
One-month postoperatively, computed tomography imagery demonstrated a patent conduit between the left superior 
vena cava and right atrial appendage.

CASE REPORT
A 56-year-old male visited our hospital with New York 
Heart Association functional class IV dyspnea and pitting 
edema in his lower extremities. The patient had been diag￾nosed with tricuspid valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation 
at an outside institution 10 years ago. However, the patient 
had refused surgical treatment at that time. Physical examina￾tion and laboratory tests demonstrated severe hepatomegaly, 
ascites, azotemia, and cardiac cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B). 
Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
showed severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, with a persistent 
left superior vena cava (SVC) draining into the coronary si￾nus and absence of the innominate vein. Magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed left and right ventricular ejection fractions 
of 31.5% and 34.2%, respectively. Heart transplantation rather 
than a tricuspid valve surgery was recommended because of 
the biventricular dysfunction.
Preoperative computed tomographic venography of the neck 
and brain was performed to evaluate the probable risk of a left
SVC ligation. The diameters of the right and left SVCs were 
17 mm and 16 mm, respectively. Abundant collaterals were 
built up at the sigmoid sinus, which was considered adequate 
for draining venous blood from the left part of the head to 
the right SVC. This finding suggested that the risk of cere￾bral venous congestion after left SVC ligation was minimal.
When opening the pericardium during heart transplantation, 
the recipient heart showed a large dilated distal part of the

hypothermia, orthotopic heart transplantation was performed 
with the standard aorto-bicaval cannulation technique using an 
additional venous cannula on the left SVC. The donor heart 
was implanted using the standard bicaval technique. Despite 
the preoperative evaluation suggesting left SVC ligation 
would be safe in this patient, the left SVC was anastomosed 
to the right atrial appendage using an interconnecting conduit 
(Fig. 1). A tubular conduit 16 mm in diameter and 4 cm in 
length was constructed using the resected coronary sinus tis￾sue to avoid size discrepancy and kinking. After the ortho￾topic cardiac transplantation was completed using the bicaval 
anastomosis technique, the tubular conduit was anastomosed 
to the distal part of the left SVC and to the right atrial ap￾pendage using continuous 5-0 polypropylene sutures. The car￾diopulmonary bypass and donor ischemic times were 354 mi￾nutes and 125 minutes, respectively. The postoperative course 
was uneventful. A computed tomography angiogram at one 
month after the surgery demonstrated a patent conduit be￾tween the left SVC and right atrial appendage (Fig. 2). The 
patient was discharged without any complications and did not 
show any sign of upper-body venous congestion at the six￾month follow-up visit.
DISCUSSION
A left SVC is an infrequent congenital abnormality with a 
prevalence of 0.3% to 0.5% in the normal population and 
2.8% to 4.3% in patients with congenital heart disease [1]. In 
the setting of cardiac transplantation, a persistent left SVC 
deserves consideration to determine the level of venous return 
during bypass as well as the bicaval anastomosis.
If a well-developed innominate vein is present, occlusion of 
the left SVC by simple ligation or division will recreate a nor￾mal venous drainage through the innominate vein. However, if 
the innominate vein is small or absent, occluding the left 
SVC may increase the risk of neurovascular complications [2].
A persistent left SVC can be preserved with several surgi￾cal techniques during orthotopic heart transplantation. These 
surgical approaches include end-to-side anastomosis of the left
SVC to the right SVC, end-to-end anastomosis of the left 
SVC to the right atrial appendage (direct anastomosis or anas￾tomosis using a conduit), and anastomosis of both right and 
left SVCs to the innominate vein of the donor graft [2-6].
A previous study presented a case of orthotopic heart trans-

plantation in a patient with a persistent left SVC [6]. In that
patient, the left SVC was passed between the ascending aorta 
and pulmonary artery, and anastomosed to the right SVC in 
an end-to-side fashion.
In the present case, there were abundant collaterals present 
at the sigmoid sinus, which might have prevented venous 
congestion if the left SVC was occluded. However, we de￾cided to preserve the left SVC to minimize this risk. 
Connecting the left SVC to the right SVC behind the ascend￾ing aorta was avoided because its passage was right-angled 
and posed a risk of compression by the aorta and pulmonary 
artery. In addition, we constructed an interconnecting graft in￾stead of using an in situ conduit, because there were issues 
such as a size discrepancy and risks of kinking and resultant 
blood stasis. The coronary sinus tissue was resected, made in￾to a tubular conduit with a diameter of 16 mm, and placed 
between the left SVC and the right atrial appendage. 
Artificial conduits were not considered due to the risk of 
thrombo-occlusion and infection.
In conclusion, we successfully performed an orthotopic 
heart transplantation in a patient with a persistent left SVC 
by reconstructing the left SVC with an interconnecting con￾duit made from autologous coronary sinus tissue, which was 
anastomosed to the distal part of the left SVC and to the 
right atrial appendage.
