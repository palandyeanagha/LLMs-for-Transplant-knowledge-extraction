Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)
is one of many vasoactive substances
postulated to participate in the develop￾ment of hypoxia-induced pulmonary
hypertension. Pulmonary vasoactive
responses to hypoxia are intensified by 5-
HT (1), but attempts to block hypoxia￾induced pulmonary hypertension with
5-HT receptor antagonists have met
with mixed success. Furthermore, it has
been difficult to establish a causal rela￾tionship between 5-HT and the physio￾logical response to hypoxia. Lacking in
much of this work is a clear distinction
between two classes of molecules, 5-HT
transporters and 5-HT receptors, either
or both of which may participate in the
response of pulmonary vascular smooth
muscle cells to 5-HT.
High levels of 5-HT have been associ￾ated with pulmonary hypertension in
several systems. Herve et al. (2) des￾cribed a patient with pulmonary hyper￾tension who had high levels of circulat￾ing 5-HT due to a platelet storage
disease, and other individuals have been
described with primary pulmonary
hypertension associated with elevated
serum 5-HT levels (3). In the fawn￾hooded rat, an animal model for
platelet storage disease that exhibits
high circulating levels of 5-HT, mild
hypoxia also leads to pulmonary hyper￾tension (4, 5). Finally, pulmonary
hypertension is also associated with
appetite suppressants, such as fenflu￾ramine or dexfenfluramine, which
block reuptake of 5-HT.
Transduction of 5-HT signals
through the serotonin transporter
and the 5-HT receptors
Several subtypes of signal-transducing
5-HT receptors have been characterized
pharmacologically and cloned (see
review in ref. 6). Depending on their
subtype, these receptors may act on G￾proteins and thereby activate phospho￾lipase C or adenylate cyclase (6). By
analogy with other signaling molecules,
it is generally assumed that these recep￾tors operate at the cell surface, without
necessarily mediating the uptake of 5-
HT. In addition, 5-HT may be internal￾ized into a variety of cell types, includ￾ing platelets, neurons, mast cells,
endothelial cells, and smooth muscle
cells, through an active transport mech￾anism that is powered by a transmem￾brane Na+/Cl– gradient (7). Transporter
genes have been cloned in rat, human,
mouse, bovine, and Drosophilia (8–13).
The serotonin transporter (SERT)
belongs to a large family of sodium
chloride–dependent γ-aminobutyric
acid/norepinephrine transporters. The
precise relationship between 5-HT
receptors and the transporter has never
been adequately defined. Some cells
appear to contain receptors, others
transporters, and some both.
Both bovine pulmonary artery
endothelial and smooth muscle cells
actively transport 5-HT (14, 15), and
this transport is enhanced by exposure
of cells to hypoxia (15, 16). Hypoxia
also activates the mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase (17), thereby
inducing c-fos transcription, which
leads to activation of hypoxia-inducible
factor-1 (HIF-1) (18). In the bovine
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell,
only one 5-HT receptor has been iden￾tified, which resembles the 5-HT1A or
5-HT4 receptor (19, 20). Stimulation of
this receptor in the presence of a phos￾phodiesterase inhibitor elevates cAMP
and inhibits cellular proliferation (21).
On the other hand, in the absence of
phosphodiesterase inhibition, cellular
cAMP does not rise, and 5-HT trans￾port predominates over transmem￾brane signaling, resulting in cellular
proliferation and hypertrophy at con￾centrations of 5-HT in the micromolar
range (22). Monoamine oxidase in￾hibitors, which block the intracellular
degradation of 5-HT, augment this
proliferative response. Thus, in this
case, it appears that the intracellular
accumulation of 5-HT drives the pro￾liferative process, since it is doubtful
that monoamine oxidase affects 5-HT
metabolism at the cell surface.
5-HT signaling through SERT also
acts through a variety of other signal￾ing molecules — tyrosine phosphoryla￾tion of GTPase-activating protein, Ras
activation, activation of NAD(P)H oxi￾dase to produce reactive oxygen species
(ROSs), and activation of ERK1/ERK2

Commentary
Figure 1
Stimulation begins with contact between 5-HT and either a transporter or receptor, which may
lead to activation of Ras or Rac or both. The signal then activates a NAD(P)H oxidase that has
not been fully characterized, leading to release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation
of the ERK1 or ERK2 MAP kinases. The consequent changes in gene expression culminate in both
cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy.

(extracellular signal-regulated kinase￾1/-2) MAP kinase — to induce smooth
muscle cell hyperplasia or hypertrophy
(Figure 1) (23–25). These signals occur
only in intact cells, not in cellular
homogenates (23). Although bovine
pulmonary artery endothelial cells
actively transport 5-HT, they neither
proliferate nor induce protein tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to this
stimulus (23). We previously demon￾strated that Chinese hamster lung
fibroblasts respond to 5-HT through
both SERT and a 5-HT2 receptor, lead￾ing to both transmembrane signaling
and proliferation (25). Similarly, in rat
mesangial cells, 5-HT activates a 5-
HT2A receptor through a Gq-pro￾tein–coupled pathway, leading to acti￾vation of phospholipase C, NAD(P)H
oxidase, and ERK MAP kinase (26, 27).
In Chinese ovary fibroblasts express￾ing an exogenous 5-HT1A receptor, 5-
HT also activates NAD(P)H oxidase,
ROS formation, and the ERK MAP
kinase through a Gi-protein–mediat￾ed pathway (28). Humblot et al.
reported that, in PC12 cells, 5-HT
induces tyrosine phosphorylation and
subsequently activates TIS8/egr-1 and
c-fos expression (29). Furthermore,
Nebigil and colleagues recently
showed that the 5-HT2B receptor
stimulates cyclin-dependent kinase
activities by at least two mechanisms:
it acts through c-Src and the receptor
tyrosine kinase platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) to
stimulate cyclin D1/cdk4 activity, and
it acts through c-Src alone to stimu￾late cyclin E/cdk2 (30). However, since
SERT and 5-HT receptors may coexist
in a single cell type, it remains possi￾ble that some of these effects require
SERT rather than the 5-HT receptor.
Nevertheless, it appears that activa￾tion of either SERT or receptor by 5-
HT, depending upon cell type, can ini￾tiate a signaling process that activates
cell proliferation (Figure 1).
SERT in the pulmonary response 
to hypoxia
These observations raise fundamental
questions about the functions of 5-HT
receptors and transporters: Do 5-HT
receptors internalize 5-HT? Do recep￾tors and transporters expressed in the
same cell interact, and, if so, how? Res￾olution of these issues is complicated
by the long-standing assumption in
the literature that 5-HT receptors,
rather than transporters, stimulate
proliferation (6). The article by
Eddahibi and associates in this issue of
the JCI (31) follows closely on their
recent work (32) showing that hypoxia
in rats upregulates SERT mRNA. Now
these authors find that mutant mice
lacking this transporter are protected
from developing pulmonary hyperten￾sion. After excluding the possibility
that hypoxic pulmonary hypertension
is reduced in mutant mice because of
attenuation of acute pressure changes,
Eddahibi et al. argue that the 5-HT
transporter is required directly in the
development of this condition (31).
The present data are consistent with
the thesis that remodeling of the pul￾monary circulation, either as a result
of or contributor to increased pul￾monary vascular pressure, depends on
the presence of SERT. They also fit
with in vitro data showing that 5-HT
causes vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation and that hypoxia en￾hances the uptake of 5-HT (15, 21, 22).
5-HT in the circulation, probably
released from platelets, likely provides
the substrate for the 5-HT transporter.
This hypothesis can also account for
dexfenfluramine-associated pul￾monary hypertension, since this drug
stimulates release of 5-HT from
platelets and neurons, inhibits 5-HT
reuptake by platelets (33), and acts
through similar signaling pathways as
5-HT to stimulate smooth muscle cell
proliferation directly (S.-L. Lee et al.,
unpublished data).
A better conceptual framework is still
needed regarding the structural identi￾ties of or relationships between the 5-
HT receptor and the 5-HT transporter.
More complete information is needed
about the precise cellular signaling
pathways of 5-HT. Perhaps most impor￾tantly, the oxidase that serves as an
intermediate in this pathway and the
specific ROS it generates must be char￾acterized more fully. Finally, as a corol￾lary, it should be determined whether
any of the components of the signaling
pathways could be blocked to prevent or
reverse pulmonary hypertension for
therapeutic benefit.
