The purpose of this study was to determine whether epirubicin, cisplatin and infused 5FU (ECF) improves overall survival (OS)
compared to 5FU, etoposide and leucovorin (FELV) in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary cancer in a prospective
randomised study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive epirubicin, cisplatin and infused 5FU ECF or bolus 5FU etoposide and
leucovorin (FELV). The primary end point was OS with secondary end points of objective response rate (ORR), failure-free survival
(FFS), quality of life (QOL) and toxicity. In all, 54 patients were recruited with 27 randomly assigned to each arm. The median OS for
ECF was 9.02 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.46 – 11.51) and FELV 12.03 months (95% CI: 9.3 – 14.7), P ¼ 0.2059. Objective
response rates were similar for both arms: ECF 19.2% (95% CI: 6.55 – 39.3); FELV 15% (95% CI: 3.2 – 37.9), P ¼ 0.72. There was
significantly increased grade 3/4 neutropenia with FELV vs ECF (53.8 vs 29.5%, respectively, P ¼ 0.020). Symptom resolution was
impressive for both regimens. This is the largest reported randomised study to date in this setting. ECF did not improve OS
compared to FELV, but was associated with less acute toxicity. These data suggest that chemotherapy can prolong OS and achieve
good symptomatic relief in advanced biliary cancer.

Biliary carcinoma is an uncommon malignancy, although its
incidence appears to be increasing worldwide (Patel, 2001; Taylor￾Robinson et al, 2001; Davila and El Serag, 2002; Khan et al, 2002).
The incidence in the United States is approximately 8 per million
and the majority of patients are over 65 years of age. The mortality
rates of biliary cancer correspond to the incidence, as the
prognosis is very poor. Surgery remains the only potentially
curative intervention; however, the majority of patients present
late with advanced unresectable disease.
Overall there are relatively few published data evaluating
palliative chemotherapy for unresectable disease. Glimelius et al
randomised patients with advanced biliary and pancreatic cancer
to best supportive care plus or minus 5FU, etoposide and
leucovorin (FELV). The median survival for the chemotherapy
arm was significantly higher compared to best supportive care
alone for all patients (6.5 vs 2.5 months, Po0.01), with a trend
towards superior survival for the patients with biliary cancer (6.5
vs 2.5 months, P ¼ 0.10) (Glimelius et al, 1996). In addition, there
was an improvement in overall quality of life (QOL) for those
patients receiving chemotherapy. However, the chemotherapy
group experienced considerable toxicity – 41% grades 3 and 4.
This was the only randomised trial reported in advanced biliary
cancer at the time of designing our study. Several phase II studies
had demonstrated activity with chemotherapy (both mono￾therapy and combination regimens), with response rates ranging
from 0 to 34% (Harvey et al, 1984; Taal et al, 1993; Jones et al, 1996;
Patt et al, 1996; Ducreux et al, 1998). We conducted a phase II study
in this setting evaluating the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin
and infused 5FU (ECF) based on encouraging activity and tolerance
in oesophagogastric cancer. This demonstrated an objective
response rate (ORR) of 40%, a median overall survival (OS) of 11
months and was associated with minimal grade 3/4 toxicity (Ellis
et al, 1995).
The lack of randomised studies in this setting, the encouraging
results produced by FELV chemotherapy vs best supportive care
alone and the activity and tolerability of ECF in our phase II study
led to the design of the randomised trial described in this report.
The primary objective of this trial was to test whether ECF would
improve the OS of patients with advanced biliary cancer compared
to FELV chemotherapy.

from all patients prior to randomisation. The study was approved
by the local institutional review boards at all participating centres.
Main end points
Overall survival was the primary end point. The secondary end
points were ORR, failure-free survival (FFS), toxicity and the
impact of treatment on QOL.
Patient selection
The main eligibility criteria were histologically or cytologically
confirmed adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma or undifferen￾tiated carcinoma of the gall bladder, intra/extrahepatic bile ducts
or ampulla of Vater; no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy;
ECOG performance status (PS) 0 –2; neutrophils 41.5  109 l
1
;
platelets 4100  109 l
1
; total white cell count 43.0  109 l
1
;
total bilirubin o30 mmol l1
; glomerular filtration rate of
460 ml min1
; and life expectancy 43 months.
Patients were excluded if there were medical or psychiatric
conditions precluding informed consent or significant cardiac
disease, arrythmias or angina pectoris.
Randomisation and study treatment
Eligible patients were centrally randomised electronically with
stratification by centre. FELV comprised of 5FU 600 mg m2 as
intravenous (i.v.) bolus days 1 –3; etoposide 120 mg m2 i.v.
infusion over 40 min days 1 –3; and leucovorin 60 mg m2 i.v.
bolus days 1 –3. Each cycle was repeated every 3 weeks.
ECF comprised of 5FU 200 mg m2 by continuous infusion via a
central line for 24 weeks; epirubicin 50 mg m2 day 1; and cisplatin
60 mg m2 with hydration day 1. Each cycle was repeated every 3
weeks.
Dose modifications
Toxicity was evaluated and graded according to the National
Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (version 2.0). Any grade
3/4 nonhaematological toxicity resulted in treatment being with￾held until recovery and then the following dose reductions were
made: FELV 50% dose reduction in 5FU subsequently; ECF 50%
dose reduction of infusional 5FU for grade 3 and 75% for grade 4.
Any grade 3/4 haematological toxicity resulted in treatment being
withheld until recovery and the following adjustments were made:
FELV resumed at full dose for one delay, 25% dose reduction of
5FU and etoposide for 2 delays and 50% for more than 2 delays;
ECF 25% dose reduction of epirubicin for grade 3 and 50% for
grade 4 neutropenia, 50% for grade 3 and 75% for grade 4
thrombocytopenia.
Safety evaluations
Patients were assessed at baseline with a full medical history and
physical examination including PS, full blood count, serum
biochemistry including electrolytes, hepatic and renal function. A
baseline EDTA or 24 h urinary clearance was performed. During
the study, full medical history and physical examination including
PS, blood count, serum biochemistry including electrolytes,
hepatic and renal function were performed prior to each cycle of
treatment.
Efficacy evaluations
Tumour response by CT assessment was performed according to
WHO criteria at 12 and 24 weeks.
Overall survival and FFS were calculated for all randomised
patients from the date of randomisation to the date of death or
time to progression, respectively. Patients still alive were censored
at the date of last contact.
Quality of life
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 question￾naire (incorporating five function scales, one global health-status
scale and nine symptoms scales), which was filled in at baseline, 6,
12, 24 and 36 weeks.
Statistics
The primary end point was OS and the study was designed to
detect a 1-year survival of 43% for ECF compared to 20% for FELV.
Thus, a total of 116 patients (58 per arm) were required based on a
two-sided a of 5% (overall power ¼ 80%). Overall survival and FFS
were compared between treatment groups using a two-sided
log-rank test, and survival was calculated from the date of
randomisation to the date of death or the date of last follow-up.
Failure-free survival was calculated from the date of randomisation
until the date of progression/death or the date of last follow-up.
For each treatment, Kaplan –Meier estimates of median survival
and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. To adjust for
confounding variables, multivariate Cox’s regression models were
used. Tumour response rates and toxicity in the two arms were
compared using the w2 test, and Fisher’s exact test was used where
appropriate. The change from baseline in QOL was compared
between the two treatment arms using the Mann –Whitney test. P￾values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant and all analyses were performed by intention to treat.
RESULTS
Recruitment was slow and thus 27 patients were randomised to
ECF and 27 to FELV between January 1997 and November 2003 in
five centres in the United Kingdom. The patient baseline
characteristics are shown in Table 1 and were generally well
balanced between both groups, although there were more patients
with bile duct carcinoma in the FELV group. The majority of
patients were of PS 0 –1.
Treatment
The median duration of treatment was 5.5. cycles for ECF and six
cycles for FELV. Dose reductions occurred in 18.5% of patients on
ECF compared with 74% of patients receiving FELV. The main

reason for dose reductions in the FELV arm was neutropenia. At
least one dose delay occurred in 44.4% of patients in the ECF arm
and 59.3% of patients in the FELV arm.
The dose intensity of each drug for both regimens is as follows:
ECF epirubicin 88%; cisplatin 90%; 5FU 84%: FELV etoposide
89%; folinic acid 91.6%; and 5FU 76%. There was a trend towards a
superior dose intensity of 5FU in the ECF cohort compared to
FELV (84 vs 76%, P ¼ 0.056).
Tumour response and symptomatic resolution
Eight patients were not evaluable for response: six had no
radiologically measurable disease and two patients stopped
treatment after only one cycle due to biliary stent infection and
Hickman line infection, respectively.
Objective. response rates were similar for both arms (ECF 19.2%
(95% CI: 6.6 –39.3); FELV 15% (95% CI: 3.2 –37.9), P ¼ 0.999
(Table 2)). A further proportion of patients in both arms achieved
stable disease (ECF 46.2% compared to FELV 45%). The rate of
progressive disease was comparable between both groups (ECF
34.6% vs FELV 40%).
Symptom resolution was achieved with both regimens ranging
from 20 to 92% for a variety of symptoms including lethargy, pain,
weight loss and anorexia (Table 3).
Survival
With a median follow-up of 387 days, there was no statistically
significant difference in median OS: ECF 9.02 mths. (95% CI: 6.46 –
11.51) and FELV12.03 mths (95% CI: 9.3 –14.7), P ¼ 0.2059
(Figure 1). Multivariate analysis for OS confirmed these findings
after controlling for performance status, locally advanced disease
and alkaline phosphatase split on the median, there was no
difference between arms, P ¼ 0.096. The 1 year OS for FELV was
50.2% (95% CI: 30 –67.3) vs 21% (95% CI: 7.8 –38.6) for ECF.
Failure-free survival
The median FFS for ECF was 157 days (95% CI: 102.09 –211. 9) and
for FELV 220 days (95%CI: 138 –301.4). The 1 year FFS for FELV
was 27.1% (95% CI: 12 –44.7) vs 11.6% (95% CI: 2.9 –26.8) for ECF
(Figure 2).
Quality of life
The compliance of patients in the QOL analysis was generally poor
for both groups. The global QOL score at baseline for ECF and
FELV: 62.9 vs 55.1 and at 12 weeks: 69.0 vs 70.83.
Toxicity
The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events is shown in Table 4. The
non-haematological toxicity was similar between both groups aside
from infection, which was significantly higher in the FELV arm.
There was one treatment related death in the FELV arm due to
sepsis and febrile neutropenia. There was a statistically higher
incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia for those patients receiving
FELV compared to ECF (53.8 vs 29.5% respectively, P ¼ 0.02).
Second line therapy
Four patients (18.5%). in the FELV arm went on to receive ECF on
disease progression. 5 (18.5%) patients in the ECF group under￾went further chemotherapy (2: carboplatin and 5FU; 1: 5FU and
mitomycin C; 1: ZD 9331 and gemcitabine; 1 patient was re￾challenged with ECF.
DISCUSSION
At the time of designing this study there were relatively few
published data for chemotherapy in advanced biliary cancer and

Clinical Studies

thus a pragmatic approach was employed to evaluate the activity of
ECF in this setting. The statistical design of the study was based on
previously published data for ECF and FELV. Unfortunately
accrual was very slow leading to closure after only 54 patients were
enrolled over six years. The poor recruitment in our study is a
reflection of this difficult population who often present at an
advanced stage and are thus unfit for chemotherapy. Thus due to
slow accrual the study was not adequately powered to detect a
meaningful difference in survival between the two arms. Never￾theless this study remains the largest randomised trial in this
setting to date.
ECF produced similar ORR, symptom resolution and FFS to
FELV and was associated with significantly less acute toxicity.
There was no difference in OS with FELV compared to ECF
(median OS: 12.03 mths vs 9.02 mths HR 1.43 (95% CI: 0.81 –2.84),
P ¼ 0.2059).
This may be partly explained by 4 (18.5%) patients in the FELV
arm receiving second line chemotherapy with ECF on disease
progression. However 5 (18.5%) patients in the ECF group
underwent further chemotherapy (2: carboplatin and 5FU; 1:
5FU and mitomycin C; 1: ZD 9331 and gemcitabine; 1 patient was
rechallenged with ECF) therefore this is unlikely to have accounted
for such a difference.
A potential criticism of this study design is the absence of an
observational control arm. There was a survival benefit for all
patients (biliary and pancreatic cancer) receiving FELV che￾motherapy vs best supportive care in the Scandinavian randomised
study (Glimelius et al, 1996). This difference was not significant
when the biliary subset was analysed separately. However the study
was only powered to detect a 6 months difference in OS with
chemotherapy for all patients. Furthermore QOL was significantly
improved for the chemotherapy subset, thus on balance we felt it
reasonable to utilise FELV chemotherapy as the reference
comparator arm in our trial.
Overall non-haematological toxicity was similar for both regi￾mens. However there was significantly higher-grade 3/4 neutrope￾nia and infection reported in the FELV arm. This resulted in sepsis
and subsequent treatment related death in one patient. Myelosup￾pression was the main reason for treatment interruptions in the
FELV group, this is reflected by the lower dose intensity of 5FU
with this regimen compared to ECF (76 vs 84%, P ¼ 0.056).
Quality of life data for all patients was generally sparse due to
poor attrition. Thus it is difficult to draw any meaningful
conclusions. There was no statistically significant difference
between global QOL scores over time for both arms. Symptom
resolution was impressive and comparable in both regimens
particularly for pain, weight loss and nausea. This is encouraging
for this group of patients who frequently present with multiple
symptoms.
There have been 2 other randomised studies reported for
advanced biliary cancer. The Scandinavian study of 37 patients
demonstrated a median OS of 6 months for FELV chemotherapy
compared to 2.5 months for best supportive care (Glimelius et al,
1996). An EORTC study of 53 patients compared high dose 5FU
with or without cisplatin. The median OS for 5FU alone was 5.3
months compared to 7.8 months for the combination arm (Mitry
et al, 2002). In our study of 54 patients the median OS for FELV
was 12.03 months and 9.03 months for ECF. Thus our data are
encouraging and provide supporting evidence that chemotherapy
can prolong OS in this disease.
A variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been investigated in
this setting mainly in the context of phase II trials. Gemcitabine is
of particular interest based on its significant activity in pancreatic
cancer (Burris et al, 1997). It has been used as monotherapy and in
combination with capecitabine, irinotecan, cisplatin and 5FU
among others. Objective response rates range from 8 –39% and
tolerance is generally acceptable. (Kubicka et al, 2001; Penz et al,
2001; Jani et al, 2002; Jacobson et al, 2003; Thongprasert et al,
2003; Knox et al, 2004). Thus further randomised studies are
underway or planned with these combination regimens vs
gemcitabine alone.
In conclusion ECF produced similar ORRs, FFS and symptom
resolution to FELV with less acute toxicity. As a result of
poor recruitment the study was underpowered to detect a
significant difference in OS between the two regimens. Thus based
on these data it is not possible to define a reference regimen
for advanced biliary cancer. Nevertheless this study has shown
that chemotherapy can prolong OS and provide good sympto￾matic relief for these patients. Further adequately powered
randomised trials are required to establish the standard of
care for this disease.
