Galactose elimination capacity as a prognostic
index in patients with fulminant liver failure
L. RANEK, P. BUCH ANDREASEN, AND N. TYGSTRUP
From the Rigshospitalet, Medical Department A, Division ofHepatology, Copenhagen, Denmark
SUMMARY In 25 patients with fulminant hepatic failure the prognostic value of a quantitative liver
function test, the galactose elimination capacity, was assessed and compared with routine liver
function tests and clinical features. The galactose elimination capacity was significantly higher
(P < 0 05) in the five patients who survived than in the 20 patients who died. None of the other
liver function tests was significantly different. The values of the galactose elimination capacity
overlapped considerably between survivors and non-survivors, but all patients with a galactose
elimination capacity below 12-8 g.mol galactose/min and kg body weight died. The disease among
most patients who died having a galactose elimination capacity greater than 13 ,umol ran a subacute
course. It is suggested that quantitative liver function tests be included when new treatments of
fulminant hepatic failure are investigated.
The high mortality in acute liver failure (Saunders
and Terblanche, 1975), and the complete recovery
of patients who survive (Karvountzis et al., 1974)
has been a strong impulse to apply drastic, expensive,
and perhaps also hazardous therapeutic measures
(Eiseman et al., 1965; Trey et al., 1966; Burnell
et al., 1973; Gazzard et al., 1974). However, none
of these treatments is of proven value, and it
cannot be excluded that recovery, when it occurs, is
spontaneous. This makes it highly desirable to
identify patients with a high chance of recovery.
Clinical features and laboratory tests have been
found to contain little, if any, prognostic information.
The present stuidy aims at elucidation of the prog￾nostic value of a quantitative liver test, the galactose
elimination capacity, in patients with acute liver
failure.
Methods
All patients were admitted to this department
because of impending or manifest acute liver failure
with hepatic encephalopathy. One patient (no. 15)
had uncomplicated hepatitis beginning 115 days
before the actual admission. She was treated in
another hospital and discharged after two months
but readmitted 43 days later because her condition

had relapsed. Eight days later she developed hepatic
coma. Otherwise no previous liver disease was
suspected in any of the patients. Only patients
reaching coma grade III (Trey et al., 1966) were
included in the study. The sex, age, and aetiology
of the liver disease are shown in Table 1. Sixteen of
the patients were females, and nine were males.
The assumed aetiology of the liver disease (Table 1)
was virus hepatitis in 19 patients. Twelve of these
were classified as type A hepatitis. HBsAg was not
investigated in two of these (nos. 7 and 15) and was
negative in the others. With a classification based
on epidemiological data seven of the patients were
classified as type B hepatitis. HB8Ag was positive
in three (nos. 16, 17, 19), negative in three (nos. 3, 4,
20), and not performed in one (no. 18). Drug
hepatitis was suspected in six patients, five of whom
had recently been exposed to halothane and one
who had been treated with ryfamycin (Rifampicine)
and isoniazid (Isoniazide).
All patients were treated in the intensive care liver
unit by trained personnel and received standard anti￾coma treatment, consisting of 20 % glucose via a
gastric tube as the only supply of calories, sterilisa￾tion of the gut with Neomycin, 4 g daily, and purga￾tion with magnesium sulphate. Additional treatment
(Table 1) consisted of infusion of fresh frozen
plasma, corticosteroids, from 30 to 80 g prednisone
daily, exchange blood transfusions (5000 ml), or
extracorporeal pig liver perfusions (Ranek et al.,
1971). Assisted respiration through a nasotracheal

tube was initiated before hypoxia or hypercapnia
developed. Peritoneal dialysis was performed if
renal failure developed. Blood was analysed regularly
for the following components: haemoglobin, sodium,
potassium, creatinine, urea, pCO2, 02 saturation,
standard bicarbonate, base excess, prothrombin,
bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline
phosphatases. Blood glucose was examined four
times daily. Serum ammonia was examined at
various intervals, usually every second or third day.
Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed
regularly during the encephalopathic period until
the patient either died or recovered. If the EEG
revealed no activity, a cervical arteriography was
performed. If intracerebral circulation could not be
demonstrated, the patient was considered brain dead.
The galactose elimination capacity was deter￾mined either shortly after admission or at the time
when the patient developed encephalopathy in the
department. The original procedure was modified
as follows: a fixed dose of 25 g galactose was
injected intravenously in the course of five minutes.
Capillary blood samples were drawn from the ear
lobe at intervals of five minutes from 25 to 60
minutes after start of the injection, and a urine
sample was collected after four hours (except in
anuric patients). Galactose concentrations were
determined enzymatically (Kurz and Wallanfalz,
1970), and the galactose elimination capacity was
computed (Hewlett-Packard 9810) with a pro￾gramme providing corrections for urinary excretion
and uneven distribution of galactose (Tygstrup,
1961). In anuric patients the galactose elimination
was not performed during peritoneal dialysis. For
the statistical evaluation Fisher's exact test and the
Mann-Whitney test were used.
Results
Twenty per cent of the patients survived (95%
confidence limits: 6-8-40 7 %).
There was no significant difference (Table 2)
between those who survived and those who died
as far as the following variables were concerned:
sex, age, duration of disease before admission,
duration of coma before or during admission, coma
grade on admission, dominant frequency of the
electroencephalogram, and liver dullness. No differ￾ence was found among surviving and non-surviving
patients regarding treatment schedules, as outlined
in Table 2. A low blood glucose level (< 2-0 mmol/l)
was recorded once in six of the patients who died.
Persistent hypoglycaemia was not seen. In none of
the survivors was hypoglycaemia recorded. In five
of the patients who died cessation of cerebral blood
flow was demonstrated. In none of these patients
was hypoglycaemia recorded..

revealed subtotal or total liver cell necrosis.
Discussion
In our 25 patients with fulminant hepatic failure,
none of the usual liver tests was of any value as
prognostic markers. Neither the prothrombin value
nor blood ammonia differed between those who
survived and those who died. This is in accordance
with works by Reynolds (1969), and by Saunders
et al. (1972), but not with that of Demedts et al.
(1974), who found blood ammonia to be significantly
higher in nine patients who died, compared with
five patients who survived. Furthermore, the initial
prothrombin values were not significantly different
but before a third exchange transfusion was per￾formed the prothrombin value (percentage of
normal) was significantly higher in the survivors.
Coagulation factor VI} is probably a better prog￾nostic marker than the prothrombin time, as shown
by Dymock (1975). In 18 patients he found that all
10 patients with a factor VII concentration above
9 % survived, while eight patients with concentrations
below 9 % died.
Other proteins synthesised by the liver that are
used as prognostic markers are (xi antitrypsin and ael
foetoprotein. Rueff et al. (1975) measured plasma
concentrations of al antitrypsin in 24 patients with
fulminant hepatitis and coma. In nine of 16 patients
who died plasma concentrations were below 1-70
mg/ml, while only one of eight survivors had a
concentration of (xi antitrypsin below that level
(p < 0-001).
Murray-Lyon et al. (1975) measured oci foeto￾protein in serum from 48 patients with fulminant
hepatic failure. In seven of 17 survivors oil foeto￾protein was positive (> 50 ,tg/ml) compared with
two of the 31 fatal cases. Although not all patients
who recovered were foetoprotein positive the
demonstration of this protein may indicate liver cell
regeneration.
An evaluation of liver histology and prognosis
has been performed in 38 patients by Opolon et al.
(1975). Hepatocyte volume in liver biopsies from
patients with fulminant hepatic failure was sig￾nificantly smaller in patients who died, but approxi￾mately half of the cases had hepatocyte volumes

Galactose elimination capacity as a prognostic index in patients with fulminant liver failure 963
corresponding with the survivors. The major draw￾back of the histological evaluation is, however, that
most centres hesitate to perform liver biopsies in
these patients because of the risk of bleeding,
although this complication was not seen in Opolon's
series.
Few quantitative liver function tests are available
for the assessment of the liver function in fulminant
hepatic failure. The conjugation of cholic acid was
measured in 14 patients by Horak and Waldram
(1975). The conjugation measured three hours after
injection of labelled cholic acid was significantly
(p < 0O001) reduced in the six patients who died.
The metabolism of certain drugs may also be
considered as a quantitative liver function test. In
patients with paracetamol liver damage, the plasma
half life of unchanged paracetamol was the most
reliable early guide to prognosis (Prescott et al.,
1971), but the material contained only one patient
who developed hepatic coma. The clearance of
phenazone was found to distinguish between patients
with and without hepatic encephalopathy (Andreasen
and Ranek, 1975), but its prognostic use in fulmin￾ant hepatic failure remains to be shown.
In the present material, no patient with fulminant
hepatic failure having a galactose elimination
capacity below 12-8 ,umol/min and kg body weight
survived. Analysis of the eight patients who died
having a galactose elimination greater than 13
,umol/min and kg body weight revealed that six
(nos. 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 23) ran a clinically
subacute course, while the disease lasted longer
than 30 days. One patient died from cardiac arrest
(no. 19). The time interval from the beginning of the
liver disease and the duration of coma before the
patient enters the hospital varies considerably. In a
patient who is admitted early in the course of the
disease the liver function may further deteriorate
after hospitalisation. Thus a relatively high galactose
elimination capacity may be found on admission,
although the patient subsequently dies from hepatic
failure. This was seen in one patient (no. 21), who
had a galactose elimination capacity of 16-9 ,tmol/
min and kg body weight on admission and 96 ,umol
the following day. Repeated determinations of the
galactose elimination capacity (Fig. 2) therefore
make prognostication more reliable, which is, of
course, also the case for most other tests.
The advantage of the galactose elimination capa￾city is that it is relatively simple to perform, especi￾ally if capillary blood is used instead of arterial
blood, and it lasts only one hour, whereas most
other metabolic investigations last several hours. It
is not influenced by changes in hepatic blood flow
or supportive treatments performed the same day,
as, for example, exchange transfusion or infusion
of fresh frozen plasma, which influence, for instance,
prothrombin and bilirubin concentrations.
Although galactose elimination is not a vital
function, it is probably a measure of the functioning
liver cell mass (Tygstrup, 1966). A quantitative liver
function test reflecting the metabolic capacity of the
liver also contains prognostic information. If the
metabolic capacity is low, it is reasonable to assume
that the prognosis is bad.
It is of considerable practical value that quan￾titative liver function tests are further investigated
and evaluated. They may make the evaluation of
different treatments in acute liver failure more com￾parable by ensuring that patients with a similar degree
of impaired liver function have been examined. The
frequently optimistic preliminary reports on new
treatments may be due to accidental selection of
patients with a relatively good liver function.
Another point of practical value is to determine
whether a quantitative liver function test can define
a critical level, indicating the minimum of liver
function which permits the survival of the patient
(a 'survival limit'). Similarly a 'regeneration limit'
may exist, and from a possible difference between
the 'survival limit' and the 'regeneration limit' it
may be possible to estimate the amount of 'liver
assist' that is needed. Finally, treatment of patients
with liver function below the 'regeneration limit'
can be omitted, unless a liver transplantation is
performed.
In the present series a 'survival limit' correspond￾ing to about 12 ,umol galactose metabolised/min
and kg body weight is suggested, Whether this limit
is influenced by the various types of supportive
treatment given to some of the patients is unknown,
but none of these treatments is of proven value. In
patients with fulminant hepatic failure and a total
duration of the disease less than five weeks this
survival limit seems to be of prognostic significance.
However, further investigation are needed. For
instance the effect of age upon this 'survival limit'
cannot be estimated in the present series.
