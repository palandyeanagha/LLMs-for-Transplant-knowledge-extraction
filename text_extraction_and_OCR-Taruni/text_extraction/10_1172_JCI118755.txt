Bioactivity of Glomerular Ultrafiltrate During Heavy Proteinuria May Contribute to 
Renal Tubulo–Interstitial Lesions
Evidence for a Role for Insulin-like Growth Factor I

Abstract
Clinical and experimental data have indicated that heavy
proteinuria in renal glomerular diseases is associated with
the formation of tubulo–interstitial fibrosis and contributes
to the progression of renal failure. Albumin in glomerular
ultrafiltrate does not appear to cause this sequelae, rather
than compounds that are associated with ultrafiltered
plasma proteins. One such protein-bound factor could be in￾sulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The present studies show
that in nephrotic rats, IGF-I is ultrafiltered in conjunction
with IGF–binding protein-2 and is present in proximal tu￾bular fluid at 1.35 nM. Proximal tubular fluid from ne￾phrotic rats autophosphorylates IGF-I receptors in cultured
proximal tubular cells. Nephrotic, but not control, rat proxi￾mal tubular fluid increases the [3H]thymidine incorporation
in cultured tubular cells, and neutralizing IGF-I–receptor
antibodies partially inhibit this activity. Incubation of cul￾tured proximal tubular cells with an extract that was pre￾pared from nephrotic rat urine increases the secretion of
collagen types I and IV. Secretion of the two collagens is in
part ameliorated by neutralizing IGF-I–receptor antibody.
In concert, these findings suggest that the IGF-I present in
nephrotic rat tubular fluid is bioactive and may contribute
to the development of tubulo–interstitial fibrosis in chronic
nephrotic glomerular diseases. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:
116–124.) Key words: insulin-like growth factor I • insulin￾like growth factor–binding proteins • glomerular ultrafil￾trate • interstitial fibrosis • nephrotic syndrome
Introduction
Several investigators have suggested that the glomerular ultra￾filtration of plasma proteins or factors that are associated with
serum proteins may cause or contribute to the development of
tubulo–interstitial pathology, which accounts for much of the
progressive renal failure in nephrotic kidney diseases (1–3). In￾sulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is bound to specific serum
proteins and patients or rats with the nephrotic syndrome ex￾crete the peptide with urine at greatly increased rates (4–6).
IGF-I is a growth factor peptide (7,600 D) that has metabolic
functions and autocrine, paracrine, and endocrinelike modes
of action (7). These actions include a rise in procollagen
mRNAs and secretion of collagen proteins in mesangial cells
(8). IGF-I could also have similar effects on proximal tubular
cells, which are known to secrete collagens and other extracel￾lular matrix proteins (9). IGF-I has mitogenic activity in cul￾tured glomerular mesangial as well as proximal tubular cells
and in renal proximal tubules in intact rats (8, 10, 11). IGF-I
receptors are expressed in the nephron in the apical as well as
the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules (12, 13), and bi￾ologic action of recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I)1
 through
both proximal tubule cell membranes has been demonstrated
(13, 14).
IGF-I binds with high affinity to IGF-binding protein
(IGFBP)-3 when the latter is associated with another protein,
the acid labile subunit (z 85 kD), to form a complex of z 150
kD. In fact, z 75% of IGF-I in serum is normally present in
this high molecular weight form (15, 16). Most of the remain￾ing IGF-I is present in serum bound to IGFBP-1, -2, or -4 in a
molecular complex of z 45 kD, and only , 1% of the circulat￾ing peptide is present in the free form (17).
In the nephrotic syndrome, a defect in the integrity of the
glomerular capillary wall results in the ultrafiltration of plasma
proteins that leads to heavy proteinuria. We and other investi￾gators have previously shown that the serum levels of IGF-I
and IGFBP-3 in the nephrotic syndrome are reduced, but
IGFBP-2 levels are elevated due to a severalfold increase in
the liver synthesis (4).
Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that, in rats
with the nephrotic syndrome, IGF-I is ultrafiltered in glomer￾uli, and proximal tubular fluid activates tubular cell IGF-I re￾ceptors, increases the thymidine incorporation, and raises the
secretion of collagen type I and IV, possibly through its IGF-I
content. By this means, nephrotic glomerular ultrafiltrate
could contribute to tubular changes that are associated with
glomerular diseases.
Methods
In vivo studies
The nephrotic syndrome was induced in male Munich Wistar rats
(200–250 g body wt; Simonson, Gilroy, CA) with a single intravenous
injection of Doxorubicin-HCl (Adriamycin; Cetus Corp., Emeryville,
CA), 4 mg/kg. Adriamycin has been shown to induce a minimal￾change diseaselike glomerular lesion in rats that is associated with
heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia (18).
These findings are comparable with the more clearly defined ne￾Address correspondence to Raimund Hirschberg, Box 406, Harbor￾UCLA Medical Center, 1000 West Carson Street, Torrance, CA

Ultrafiltered Insulin-like Growth Factor I in the Nephrotic Syndrome 117
phrotic syndrome in humans, and this term will be used for the rat
model in this study. Control rats received saline. Stable gross pro￾teinuria developed at z 3 wk after the injection and most studies
were performed in rats at 18 to 21 d after the adriamycin injection. In￾dividual studies included measurements of parameters describing the
single nephron glomerular filtration of water and small solutes, of al￾bumin and IgG, and of IGF-I and associated IGFBPs. Furthermore,
proximal tubule fluid was collected for the study of IGF-I receptor
activation (autophosphorylation) and [3H]thymidine incorporation in
cultured proximal tubule cells. Finally, the stimulation of collagen se￾cretion by IGF-I that is present in nephrotic urinary extracts was ex￾amined in cultured proximal tubule cells.
Renal and glomerular hemodynamics. The glomerular ultrafiltra￾tion rate (GFR) and the single nephron glomerular filtration rate of
water and small solutes were measured in nephrotic and control rats
at 3 wk using micropuncture methods as previously described (19–21).
Briefly, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal Inactin (Byk￾Gulden, Konstanz/Bodensee, FRG), 120 mg/kg body wt. A tracheos￾tomy was performed and PE-50 catheters were inserted into the left
internal jugular vein, left femoral artery, and the left ureter. The kid￾ney was sealed in cotton soaked in 1% agar solution and was bathed
continuously with saline at 378C.
An infusion of [3H]inulin (ICN Radiochemicals Div., ICN Bio￾medicals Inc., Irvine, CA) in Ringer’s solution at 100 mCi/ml was
given continuously at 1.5 ml/h. In some studies (vide infra) inulin was
omitted. Surgical plasma losses were substituted (19). Arterial blood
pressure was measured continuously with a pressure transducer
(P23dB; Gould-Statham Inc., Cleveland, OH) that was connected to
the femoral artery catheter and recorded with a multichannel re￾corder (8805C; Hewlett-Packard Co., Waltham, MA). Measurements
of hydrostatic pressures in glomerular capillaries, Bowman’s space,
and proximal tubules were made as previously described (19). Ex￾actly timed fluid collections were made from early proximal tubules
that were accessible with sharpened 9–11-mm–tip glass pipettes filled
with Sudan black-stained mineral oil, and an oil drop was injected at
the beginning of each collection to prevent downstream escape of tu￾bule fluid during the collection. Early proximal tubule segments were
defined as those followed by at least two further surface loops and
were identified by injection of a small amount of brilliant green￾stained Ringer’s saline with a sharpened 3-mm–tip pipette. For the
measurement of the single nephron GFR (SNGFR), five 3-min tu￾bule fluid collections were obtained. For other individual protocols,
more extensive, exactly timed tubule fluid collections were made as
described below.
An arterial blood sample was obtained at the beginning and end
of the period of micropuncture to measure the serum 3H-insulin, total
protein, and albumin levels. In rats in which nephron hemodynamics
were measured, 2 to 3 collections of efferent arteriolar blood were
made from star vessels with sharpened z 13-mm–tip glass pipettes
(19). Individual determinants of nephron ultrafiltration were mea￾sured or calculated as described before (19).
Measurements of the single nephron ultrafiltration of IGF-I, albu￾min, and IgG. An additional six control and eight nephrotic rats
were prepared for tubule micropuncture as described above. These
animals, however, received initial infusions of saline without inulin to
collect early proximal tubule fluid for IGF-I measurements. From
each animal, tubule fluid was collected with oil-filled 9–11-mm sharp￾ened pipettes. Several collections for up to 10 min each were obtained
in each animal and pooled in 200 ml of 0.5 N HCl. Samples were
stored at 2708C for subsequent IGF-I assay. During these micro￾puncture measurements, urine was collected from the left ureter for
measurement of IGF-I.
In the nephrotic rats, after completion of these collections, the in￾fusion was exchanged for Ringer’s saline containing [3H]inulin and
1 h was allowed for equilibration of the inulin into extracellular spaces.
During the period of equilibration, timed tubule fluid collections (5–8
min) were made and urine was collected from the left kidney to de￾termine the albumin (z 68 kD) and IgG (z 158 kD) ultrafiltration
and excretion rates and to calculate fractional clearances. The timed
collections were pipetted into 450 ml of sample buffer (1% normal
rabbit serum in PBS) and stored at 2208C until assayed for albumin
and IgG. After equilibration, timed 3–min proximal tubule fluid col￾lections were obtained and urine was collected to determine the
SNGFR and GFR. In a pilot study, the single nephron–sieving coeffi￾cient for albumin was estimated in 17 nephrotic animals at different
periods of time (5–22 d) after the injection of adriamycin. In the latter
animals, the single nephron ultrafiltration rate of albumin and the
SNGFR were measured concomitantly.
Examination of the single nephron ultrafiltration of IGFBPs.
To examine the glomerular ultrafiltration of IGFBPs, early proximal
tubule fluid was obtained from 12 rats at 3 wk after the induction of
the nephrotic syndrome. In each of these animals, individual collec￾tions of early proximal tubule fluid were made for a total of z 100
min, and samples that were obtained from three consecutive rats
were pooled and stored in 15 ml of 23 SDS sample buffer (0.15 M
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol
blue) for subsequent Western ligand and immune analysis.
Proximal tubular fluid collections for ex vivo studies. Additional col￾lections of proximal tubular fluid were made from nephrotic and con￾trol rats and combined in separate pools. Aliquots of pooled proximal
tubular fluid were used in in vitro experiments (see below) to exam￾ine the activation of IGF-I receptors and the [3H]thymidine incorpo￾ration in cultured proximal tubular cells.
Laboratory assays
Total protein was measured in urine that was collected from the left
ureter during the micropuncture studies. Proteins were precipitated
by addition of trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%.
Precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 g, 10 min, 48C) and
dissolved in 1 M NaOH. The total protein concentration was then
measured with the Lowry protein assay using bovine serum albumin
as standard. Serum total protein was measured with the Lowry assay
and albumin was measured in diluted serum with an ELISA (19).
Albumin and IgG in glomerular ultrafiltrate that was collected by
micropuncture was measured by the respective specific ELISA. The
albumin ELISA has been described previously in detail from this lab￾oratory (19).
The IgG ELISA was adopted from a method which was previ￾ously developed in this laboratory to measure low levels of IgG in
normal human urine (22). Briefly, 96-well flat-bottom polystyrene
ELISA plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) were coated with
goat anti–rat IgG (Cappel Laboratories, Organon Teknika Corp,
West Chester, PA), 5 mg/ml, in coating buffer (0.1 M Na2HCO3
, pH
9.8), 100 ml/well, and incubated at 48C for 72 h. Wells were washed
3 3 with washing buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M NaH2PO4
, pH 7.3,
0.05% Tween 20). Standards (rat IgG, Cappel Laboratories; 0.5 to 20
ng/ml), or diluted samples in incubation buffer (PBS containing 1%
normal rabbit serum) or blanks (100 ml/well), were incubated over￾night at room temperature. Wells were washed 33 and then incu￾bated with second antibody (horseradish peroxidase–labeled rabbit
anti–rat IgG, Cappel Laboratories) at 1:7,500 in incubation buffer,
100 ml/well, for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed 53 and
substrate solution (0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 6.0, 0.25%
o-phenylene diamine, 0.012% H2O2), 100 ml/well, was added and
plates were incubated for 30–60 min in the dark at room temperature
until a green color developed. The reaction was stopped by addition
of 0.1 M sodium sulfite in 4 M H2SO4
, 50 ml/well. The absorbance was
measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (UV-Max; Molecular De￾vices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). The intra- and interassay coefficient of
variation are both , 5%.
IGF-I levels in proximal tubule fluid were estimated after extrac￾tion and semipurification of samples by nonequilibrium radioimmu￾noassay using minor modifications of a previously described method
(20, 23, 24). Briefly, IGF-I was extracted and separated by reverse￾phase HPLC on a methanol gradient with a mobile phase of 7% (vol/
vol) acetic acid using a C-18 peptide HPLC-column (Vydac, Hisperia,

118 R. Hirschberg
CA) at a total flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and 1-min fractions were col￾lected. The IGF-I fractions (as determined by calibration with 125I￾IGF-I) were pooled, evaporated in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant
Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and taken up in 25 ml of assay
buffer (0.03 M NaH2PO4
, 0.01 M Na-EDTA, pH 7.5, 0.02% prota￾mine sulfate, 0.02% Na-azide, 0.05% Tween 20). Recombinant
human IGF-I (gift from Ciba Geigy, Summit, NY) were used as
standards that were analyzed in quadruplicate. Samples were prein￾cubated with primary antibody UB3-189 (provided as a gift by the
National Hormone and Pituitary Program through Ogden BioSer￾vices Corp., Rockville, MD) for 72 h at 48C. 125I-IGF-I (Amersham
Corp., Arlington Heights, IL), 10,000 cpm/tube, was added and tubes
were incubated for another 24 h at 48C. Sheep anti–rabbit IgG (Cap￾pel Laboratories) was added at a final dilution of 1:100 and tubes
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, normal
rabbit serum (Cappel Laboratories) was added at a final dilution of
1:100 and tubes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Immune
complexes were pelleted and washed twice with 4% polyethylene gly￾col in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2. Supernatants were decanted and the ra￾dioactivity in the pellet was measured in a gamma counter. The re￾covery after extraction and HPLC-separation, tested with 125I-IGF-I
spiked, diluted serum, was 8062%. The intra- and interassay coeffi￾cients of variation for the RIA were 8.160.9% (n 5 7) and
14.361.6% (n 5 5), respectively.
Analysis of IGFBPs in proximal tubular fluid. IGFBPs were an￾alyzed by Western ligand blot as well as Western immunoblot as pre￾viously described by Hossenlopp et al. (25, 26) as well as from this
laboratory (4). Briefly, proximal tubular fluid in sample buffer was
denatured by incubating in a water bath at 908C for 10 min and then
electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Separated
proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Fil￾ters were blocked with blocking buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM
NaCl, 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then
incubated with 125I-IGF-I, 1 mCi in 12 ml of blocking buffer contain￾ing 0.05% Tween 20 for 16 h at 48C. Membranes were then washed
extensively with washing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween 20), dried at 48C, and autoradiographed.
Western immunoblotting was performed for IGFBP-2 on the
same membrane after completion of the ligand blotting assay without
prior stripping. The membrane was briefly washed in washing buffer,
reblocked with blocking buffer containing 3% fat-free dry milk in￾stead of BSA, and incubated for 16 h with rabbit anti–bovine IGFBP-2
polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY),
1:1,500 in 20 ml of blocking buffer at 48C. This antibody reacts well
with rat IGFBP-2 (4). Membranes were washed extensively and incu￾bated successively with biotinylated anti–rabbit IgG (1:3,000, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and horseradish peroxidase–streptavi￾din, 1:3,000 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL)
both in blocking buffer containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20.
After extensive washing, bands were visualized with enhanced chemi￾luminescence using a commercially available reagent and the manu￾facturer’s instructions (Amersham Corp.).
In vitro studies
Mouse proximal tubular cells were kindly donated by Carolyn Kelly,
M.D., La Jolla, CA. These cells had been obtained from microdis￾sected mouse proximal tubules (9). Cells were grown in DMEM/F-12
(1:1) containing 10% FCS, 50 nM hydrocortisone, penicillin 200 IU/
ml, and Streptomycin, 200 mg/ml. In the present studies, the cells
were used in three lines of experiments to examine: (a) whether IGF-I
in proximal tubular fluid from nephrotic rats activates IGF-I recep￾tors; (b) whether proximal tubular fluid raises the tubule cell thymi￾dine incorporation through IGF-I receptor mechanisms; and (c)
whether an IGF-I–containing acidic urinary extract increases the se￾cretion of collagen proteins by cultured proximal tubule cells.
Examination of IGF-I receptor activation by nephrotic tubular
fluid. Cultured mouse proximal tubule cells were washed 33 with
serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h in medium containing
BSA, 50 mg/ml, in lieu of FCS. Cells were then detached by trypsina￾tion and washed 33 with phosphate-free MEM (Gibco Laboratories,
Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). The cellular ATP-pool
was metabolically labeled by incubating the cell suspension with
MEM containing [32P]orthophosphoric acid, 1 mCi/ml (DuPont￾NEN, Boston, MA), in a shaking water bath at 378C for 1.5 h. Cells
were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of P-free MEM. Equal aliquots
of suspended cells were quickly added to microcentrifuge tubes con￾taining either no additive (control), pooled proximal tubule fluid
from nephrotic rats at a final dilution of 1:13 (estimated final IGF-I
concentration of z 100 pM), rhIGF-I (100 pM), or rhIGF-I together
with recombinant human IGFBP-2 (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon,
CA) at 100 and 500 pM, respectively. Incubations were performed for
2 min at room temperature. Cells were then quickly pelleted by cen￾trifugation for 15 s at 8,000 g. Supernatants were aspirated, cells were
washed 33 with ice-cold MEM and then lysed in 1.0 ml of lysate
buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4
, 20 mM NaH2PO4
, 60 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycho￾late, 2 mM Na3VO4
, 0.2 mM leupeptin, 0.2 mM pepstatin A, 0.2 mM
aminobenzene-sulfonylfluoride, 15 mM sodium azide, and 1 mg/ml
aprotinin) by repeated freezing in liquid N2
 and thawing on ice. Ly￾sates were precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 45 min and
cleared by incubation with 50 ml protein-A/GPlus-agarose (Oncogene
Science Inc., Uniondale, NY) for 1 h at 48C on a shaking platform and
subsequent centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with mono￾clonal anti–IGF-I receptor antibody (Oncogene Science Inc.), 1.5 mg/
ml, and 25 ml of protein-A/GPlus-agarose suspension at 48C for 16 h on
a shaking platform. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifuga￾tion and washed 53 with ice-cold lysate buffer. The final pellet was
taken up in 23 SDS-sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol.
Samples were denatured by boiling for 3 min and electophoresed in a
7.5% SDS-PAGE gel by loading each complete sample in a single
lane. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. The activity of ne￾phrotic rat proximal tubular fluid to activate tubular cell IGF-I recep￾tors was examined in three separate but similar experiments.
Measurement of the effect of early proximal tubular fluid on [3H]thy￾midine incorporation in cultured mouse proximal tubular cells.
Mouse proximal tubule cells were grown to about 70% confluence in
96-well flat-bottom culture plates (Corning Glass Works). Cells were
washed 33, and then incubated with DMEM/F-12 containing BSA
(25 mg/ml), 100 ml/well for 24 h. Cells were washed again and incu￾bated with DMEM/F-12, 50 ml/well, containing [3H]thymidine (30
mCi/ml) and geometrically diluted rhIGF-I, 4.9 to 5000 pM (n 5 4
each), or nephrotic rat proximal tubule fluid (1:13) in the presence
(n 5 2) or absence (n 5 2) of neutralizing anti–IGF-I–receptor mono￾clonal antibody (10 mg/ml) or normal rat proximal tubule fluid (1:13,
n 5 2). Incubations were made for 5 h at 378C in a cell incubator.
Wells were washed 43 in ice-cold medium, 23 with 5% trichloroace￾tic acid, 23 with 95% ethanol, and then dried in a fume hood. Cells
were lysed overnight with 1 N NaOH, 25 ml/well. The 3H-labeled ra￾dioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Total cell
protein per well was measured with a microadaptation of the Lowry
assay in separate wells in the same microplate.
In a separate experiment, cells were incubated in 96-well plates
with medium (25 ml/well) containing [3H]thymidine (40 mCi/ml), and
either normal or nephrotic rat proximal tubular fluid at a dilution of
1:10 or rhIGF-I (200 pM and 1 nM), each in the presence or absence
of IGF-I–receptor neutralizing mAb (n 5 7 per group). Cells were in￾cubated for 8 h at 378C in a humidified atmosphere. The incorporated
tritium radioactivity was measured as above. The total cell protein
per well was measured in separate wells (n 5 24) and was 15.460.6
mg/well.
Measurement of the effect of a urinary extract on secretion of col￾lagen type I and IV in mouse proximal tubular cells. Bladder urine that
was collected and pooled from control or nephrotic rats was sterile
filtered and dialyzed for 48 h at 48C against 6 liters of 50 mM acetic
acid in deionized, distilled water using dialysis membrane tubing with
a molecular cutoff of 500 D (Spectrum, Laguna Hills, CA). The dialy-

Ultrafiltered Insulin-like Growth Factor I in the Nephrotic Syndrome 119
sate was exchanged at 12-h intervals. The dialyzed urine was centri￾fuged through spin concentrators (molecular cutoff at 30 kD; Amicon
Corp., Danvers, MA) and the flow-through was lyophilized. The lyo￾physate was resolved in DMEM/F-12 corresponding to the original
urine volume. The IGF-I concentration in the nephrotic urine extract
was estimated by RIA and was 41 ng/ml.
Mouse proximal tubular cells were grown to z 75% confluence in
6-well plates and incubated in DMEM/F-12 containing BSA, 50 mg/
ml, in lieu of FCS for 24 h. Cells were incubated for 60 h at 378C with
medium (2 ml/well) containing no additive (control), rhIGF-I (2 nM),
nephrotic urinary extract at 1:5, or nephrotic urinary extract (1:5) plus
IGF-I–receptor monoclonal antibody, 5 mg/ml (n 5 12 each). In a
separate experiment, cells were incubated without additive (control),
or with rhIGF-I (2 nM), IGF-I–receptor antibody (5 mg/ml), or
rhIGF-I (2 nM) 1 IGF-I–receptor antibody (5 mg/ml). Conditioned
media were cleared by centrifugation and concentrated with spin con￾centrators with a cutoff of 30 kD. Concentrates were taken up in coat￾ing buffer to a final volume of 200 ml (10-fold concentrated). Collagen
type I and IV were measured in duplicate with specific ELISA assays
using the methods that were published previously from this labora￾tory (8). Cells were lysed in 1 N NaOH and the total cell protein was
measured with the Lowry protein assay.
Statistical comparisons were made with Student’s t test or the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test using Statmost software (Data Most
Corp., Salt Lake City, UT). Results are reported as means6SEM.
Significance was defined as P , 0.05.
Results
A single intravenous injection of adriamycin, 4 mg/kg, induced
proteinuria, primarily albuminuria. Adriamycin altered the
single nephron-sieving coefficient for albumin, which in￾creased progressively, particularly during the first 2 wk (Fig.
1). All studies were performed at 18–21 d after the administra￾tion of adriamycin.
Glomerular hemodynamics. At 3 wk in nephrotic rats there
was a trend, albeit not significant, for reduced GFR, single
nephron GFR, and single nephron plasma flow compared to
control animals (Table I). However, the glomerular transcapil￾lary pressure gradient was significantly lower and the glomeru￾lar ultrafiltration coefficient tended to be lower in the nephrotic
compared to the control rats (Table I).
Nephron ultrafiltration of proteins and IGF-I at 3 wk in
nephrotic rats. The serum albumin levels were significantly
reduced in nephrotic rats (1.860.2 g/dl) compared to controls
(2.960.2 g/dl, P , 0.05), and the total serum protein concen￾trations were 4.2 vs 5.9 g/dl, respectively (P , 0.05). The pro￾teinuria from the left kidney was 962 mg/min and 216632 mg/
min in control and nephrotic rats, respectively. As was re￾ported previously (4), the serum IGF-I levels were signifi￾cantly reduced in the nephrotic rats (203643 ng/ml) compared
to control animals (320629 ng/ml, P , 0.05) and IGF-I was ex￾creted in urine in nephrotic animals at a rate of 129610 pg/min
(0.6160.15 pg/mg urinary protein).
The glomerular ultrafiltration rates of albumin, IgG, and
IGF-I were estimated at 3 wk in nephrotic rats. The glomeru￾lar ultrafiltration of albumin was much greater than that of
IgG (Table II), whereas the serum albumin levels (1.860.2 g/dl)
were only about threefold greater than the serum IgG levels
(0.660.1 g/dl), suggesting selectivity towards albumin ultrafil￾tration.
In four out of six normal control rats, the proximal tubular
fluid IGF-I levels were at or below the sensitivity of the IGF-I
assay. In two control rats, the B/B0
 values for these two sam￾ples were at the low end of the RIA-displacement curve (Fig.
2) where the assay does not reliably discriminate. Thus, in nor￾mal control rats, the single nephron glomerular ultrafiltration
of IGF-I is extremely low. In contrast, proximal tubule fluid
IGF-I levels could be estimated in all nephrotic rats (Fig. 2, Ta￾ble II). The molar concentration of IGF-I in early proximal tu￾bular fluid in nephrotic rats was calculated from the average
SNGFR and the nephron filtration rate of IGF-I and averaged
1.35 nM (Table II).
From the primary data, the fractional single nephron clear￾ance (sieving coefficient) for IGF-I could be calculated and was

IGF-binding proteins in glomerular ultrafiltrate. The differ￾ence in the proximal tubular levels of IGF-I between control
and nephrotic rats suggested that IGF-I underwent glomerular
ultrafiltration as a complex with IGFBPs. Thus, IGFBPs were
examined in early proximal tubular fluid by Western ligand
blot and Western immunoblot. Western ligand blotting dem￾onstrated a single band at z 33 kD in each of the pooled sam￾ples, consistent with the presence of IGFBP-2 in nephrotic rat
proximal tubular fluid (Fig. 3 A). No bands were visualized
that may correspond to IGFBP-1, -3, or -4 (Fig. 3 A). The same
membrane shown in Fig. 3 A was subsequently analyzed by
Western immunoblotting with a specific anti–IGFBP-2 anti￾body. This analysis demonstrates that the single band found in
the Western ligand blot is indeed IGFBP-2 (Fig. 3 B). This lat￾ter assay also depicts a band slightly above the 100-kD marker,
which is an unidentified protein that may cross-react in the as￾say. This band does not correspond to any of the known IGF￾binding proteins.
Thus, the only IGF-binding protein that can be demon￾strated in glomerular ultrafiltrate in nephrotic rats is IGFBP-2,
suggesting that the only or primary mode of glomerular ultra￾filtration of IGF-I is the filtration of molecular complexes con￾taining IGFBP-2 and IGF-I.
IGF-I–receptor activation by proximal tubular fluid was
examined in vitro using cultured mouse proximal tubular cells
that were metabolically labeled with phosphorous-32. Fig. 4

experiments, nephrotic proximal tubular fluid tended to increase
the IGF-I receptor b-subunit phosphorylation 1.960.4-fold
compared to control. rhIGF-I and rhIGF-I 1 IGFBP-2 increased
the receptor autophosphorylation 2.360.4- and 1.660.3-fold,
respectively.
Effects of glomerular ultrafiltrate on [3H]thymidine in￾corporation by cultured proximal tubular cells. Incubation of
mouse proximal tubular cells with rhIGF-I at concentrations
between 4.9 and 5,000 pM progressively increased the [3H]thy￾midine uptake by the cells (Fig. 5). There was a log-linear cor￾relation (r 5 0.88) between the [3H]thymidine incorporation
and the rhIGF-I concentration (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 also suggests that
nephrotic rat proximal tubular fluid increases the [3H]thymi￾dine incorporation. In the presence of IGF-I–receptor neutral￾izing antibody, the [3H]thymidine uptake was less, and both
samples obtained from normal control rats resulted in an even
lesser rate of incorporation of [3H]thymidine in cultured proxi￾mal tubule cells (Fig. 5). These semiquantitative findings were
confirmed in a similar experiment using equal aliquots from a
single pool of normal or nephrotic proximal tubular fluid. The
results of this latter experiment are shown in Table III. rhIGF-I,
as well as nephrotic rat proximal tubular fluid, increased the
[
3H]thymidine uptake significantly above control (P , 0.05).
The neutralizing IGF-I receptor antibody reduced the IGF-I–
induced increase in thymidine uptake (P , 0.05, Table III),
tended to reduce the nephrotic tubular fluid-induced uptake of
[
3H]thymidine (P 5 0.0692), but did not significantly alter the
uptake of the tracer under control conditions (Table III).
Effects of IGF-I and urinary extracts on collagen type I and
IV secretion by cultured proximal tubule cells. As previously
shown by other investigators, cultured mouse proximal tubule
cells secrete both collagen type I and IV, as well as other extra￾cellular matrix proteins (9). Incubation of the cells with rhIGF-I,
2 nM, for 60 h significantly increased the secreted amounts of
collagen type I (P , 0.05) and type IV (P , 0.05) (Fig. 6). Sim￾ilarly, the levels of both collagen proteins in medium were in￾creased when the cells were incubated with the extract from
nephrotic rat urine (Fig. 6). Addition of an IGF-I–receptor
neutralizing antibody reduced the rise in collagen secretion
that was induced by the urine extract (Fig. 6). As determined
in a separate experiment, the IGF-I–receptor neutralizing anti￾body alone did not affect the baseline collagen secretion, but
reduced the IGF-I–stimulated secretion of collagen types I and
IV by 77611% and 69612%, respectively.
Discussion
The present studies demonstrate that in nephrotic rats IGF-I is
ultrafiltered into proximal tubules in association with IGFBP-2
Figure 4. Activation of IGF-I receptors by nephrotic rat proximal tu￾bule fluid. Mouse proximal tubular cells were metabolically labeled 
with phosphorous-32. Equal aliquots of suspended cells were then in￾cubated (2 min) without additive (control, lane 1), pooled nephrotic 
rat proximal tubule fluid at 1:13 (corresponding to an estimated final 
IGF-I concentration of z 100 pM) (lane 2), rhIGF-I (100 pM, lane 3), 
and rhIGF-I (100 pM) 1 rhIGFBP-2 (500 pM, lane 4). Cells were 
lysed and IGF-I receptors were immunoprecipitated and electro￾phoresed under reducing conditions in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide 
gel. The autoradiogram depicts the phosphorylated b-subunit of the 
receptor at z 95 kD as indicated (IGF-I R b). The heavily phosphory￾lated band on top of each lane corresponds to an unidentified copre￾cipitated protein.

and that IGF-I is bioactive in tubule fluid. The fractional renal
clearance (fractional excretion) of IGF-I was more than one
order of magnitude lower than the single nephron fractional
clearance (sieving coefficient) of IGF-I. This finding suggests
that only a small percentage of the ultrafiltered IGF-I under￾goes urinary excretion. Most of the IGF-I that is ultrafiltered
into proximal tubules appears to be either bound and/or de￾graded somewhere in the nephron, and measurements in urine
underestimate the rate of glomerular ultrafiltration of IGF-I.
Increased urinary excretion of IGF-I and IGFBPs in the
nephrotic syndrome have been described previously by this
and other laboratories (4–6). These latter studies also demon￾strated urinary excretion of IGFBP-3 in the nephrotic syn￾drome. The present finding that IGFBP-3 does not seem to be
present in proximal tubular fluid in nephrotic rats may suggest
that this binding protein is secreted in the distal nephron, but
this has not yet been proven directly.
Two mechanisms contribute to the glomerular ultrafiltra￾tion of IGF-I in addition to the defect in the glomerular ultra￾filtration barrier. First, IGFBP-2–containing protein com￾plexes are relatively small (z 45 kD) and are therefore more
likely to undergo glomerular ultrafiltration in the nephrotic
syndrome compared to the large (z 150 kD) complex. This is
further corroborated by the finding that the single nephron
clearance of IGF-I was about threefold greater than the single
nephron clearance of albumin (68 kD). This suggests that the
molecular mass at which IGF-I undergoes glomerular ultrafil￾tration is less than that of albumin. The ratio of the single
nephron clearances of IGF-I and albumin would be expected
to be , 1.0, if the ultrafiltration of IGF-I would primarily oc￾cur as the 150 kD molecular complex. Second, as was demon￾strated previously from this laboratory, serum IGFBP-2 is ele￾vated severalfold in the nephrotic syndrome as a result of
increased synthesis of this binding protein in the liver (4).
Moreover, serum IGFBP-3, which normally carries most of the
circulating IGF-I, is reduced in the nephrotic syndrome (4, 27).
Although the present experimental findings suggest that
IGF-I undergoes glomerular ultrafiltration together with
IGFBP-2 as a z 45 kD molecular complex, the peptide may
not remain in this complex. The tubular fluid composition
changes with downstream flow and the pH decreases. This
may favor dissociation of the peptide from the binding protein.
In nephrotic rats, IGF-I is present in glomerular ultrafil￾trate at concentrations that are biologically significant because
IGF-I activates IGF-I receptors in proximal tubular cells and may
activate IGF-I receptors in the apical cell membrane of renal
tubules in vivo. The in vitro studies in cultured mouse proxi￾mal tubular cells that express IGF-I receptors (13) show that
proximal tubular fluid obtained from nephrotic rats increases
the receptor b-subunit autophosphorylation (Fig. 4). This find￾ing also indicates that IGF-I in tubule fluid remains bioactive.
There are species differences within several experiments in
the present studies. These include the study of effects of rat
IGF-I and rhIGF-I on biologic events in mouse proximal tubu￾lar cells. Sequence and structure of human, rat, and mouse
IGF-I, IGF-I receptors, and IGFBPs are similar, and binding
of IGF-I to IGF-I receptors and IGFBPs have been shown to
occur across species boundaries (13, 14, 28). There may be
some species-dependent differences in the binding affinity of
IGF-I to the receptor and to IGFBPs that are currently un￾known and were not examined in the present study.
IGFBPs in general, and IGFBP-2 specifically, have been
shown to inhibit as well as enhance actions of IGF-I (7, 29–33).
In the present in vitro studies, rhIGFBP-2 at fivefold molar ex￾cess only modestly inhibits the activation of IGF-I receptors by
the ligand in cultured proximal tubule cells (Fig. 4). Several fac￾tors may contribute to this modest inhibitory action of IGFBP-2
in this experiment. Compared to other IGFBPs, IGFBP-2 has
a lower affinity for IGF-I compared to IGF-II (34). The excess
IGFBP-2 concentration was chosen to allow for the detection
of even modest inhibition of IGF-I by this binding protein. Al￾though the actual levels of IGFBP-2 in tubule fluid were not
measured quantitatively, it is unlikely that the levels were of
great molar excess compared to the IGF-I concentration. The
results of other experiments within the present studies (Figs. 5
and 6) also indicate that tubule fluid IGF-I is bioactive despite
the presence of IGFBP-2.
IGF-I is a modest mitogen and is known to increase the
[
3H]thymidine uptake in vitro in cultured tubular cells (10) and
Figure 6. Effect of rhIGF-I (2 nM) and normal or nephrotic (NS) rat

and type IV (bottom). Cells were incubated for 60 h. Media were con￾centrated tenfold and then analyzed by ELISA. Data are

Ultrafiltered Insulin-like Growth Factor I in the Nephrotic Syndrome 123
in vivo in proximal tubules in rats (11). Fig. 5 indicates that tu￾bule fluid from nephrotic rats raises the [3H]thymidine uptake
in cultured proximal tubule cells through IGF-I receptor
mechanisms, since the effect tends to be ameliorated with neu￾tralizing IGF-I receptor antibodies. The bioactivity towards
[
3H]thymidine uptake that is not inhibited by the neutralizing
receptor antibody results from either incomplete inhibition of
the receptors and/or the presence of other mitogens in proxi￾mal tubular fluid. Jones et al. demonstrated tubule epithelial
cell proliferation in vivo in rats with the experimental neph￾rotic syndrome (35). The findings in the present study suggest
that ultrafiltered IGF-I contributes to this process.
Glomerular diseases that cause heavy proteinuria are often
associated with progressive tubulo–interstitial injury, which
appears to define the degree and rate of progression of renal
failure (36–46). This can be demonstrated in human renal dis￾ease as well as in experimental rat models of the nephrotic syn￾drome (3, 36–46). Furthermore, clinical trials have shown that
the degree of proteinuria correlates positively with the rate of
progression of renal failure (1, 2, 47). Rats with adriamycin￾induced experimental glomerulopathy develop chronic renal
failure and tubulo–interstitial scarring in association with pro￾longed, severe proteinuria (3). Thus, there is clinical and experi￾mental evidence to suggest a connection between heavy protein￾uria, interstitial fibrosis, and the progression of renal failure.
Experimental evidence indicates that tubulo–interstitial
damage may not result from ultrafiltered albumin per se, but
may rather be induced by compounds that are associated with
filtered plasma proteins. Thomas and associates have sug￾gested that fatty acids that are carried on ultrafiltered albumin
may contribute to the tubulo–interstitial injury in the nephrotic
syndrome, but not fatty acid–free albumin (48, 49). The
present studies suggest that IGF-I may also contribute to this
sequelae. IGF-I is a growth factor peptide with a variety of bi￾ologic actions that include the induction of extracellular matrix
protein synthesis such as collagen type I and IV (8). Under
normal conditions, serum IGF-I is largely excluded from glom￾erular ultrafiltration due to its protein binding, but not in the
nephrotic syndrome. The present studies demonstrate that
rhIGF-I, as well as the urinary extracts from nephrotic rats, in￾crease the secretion of collagen type I and IV in cultured prox￾imal tubular cells. This extract may also contain growth factor
peptides and bioactive compounds other than IGF-I that could
raise the collagen synthesis. However, the finding that incuba￾tion of the cells with the urine extract in the presence of neu￾tralizing IGF-I–receptor antibodies reduces the extract-induced
rise in collagen secretion suggests that the IGF-I content con￾tributes to the increased collagen formation (Fig. 6). Hence,
IGF-I that reaches tubular cells by means of glomerular ultra￾filtration may contribute to the extracellular matrix accumula￾tion in chronic nephrotic diseases either directly or indirectly
or both. Ziyadeh et al. recently demonstrated that in cultured
proximal tubular cells (the same cell line as used in the present
studies), IGF-I increases the expression of TGF-b type II re￾ceptors without changing the TGF-b levels (28). Indeed, in rats
with the adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome, the renal
expression of TGF-b type II receptors is substantially in￾creased (50). The TGF-b system, in turn, is known to contrib￾ute markedly to the extracellular matrix accumulation in a va￾riety of in vivo and in vitro renal disease models (35, 51).
Hence, tubular fluid IGF-I may also act through this latter
mechanism.
In summary, the in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate
that IGF-I is present in tubule fluid in nephrotic rats and that
the peptide is bioactive. IGF-I can transmit metabolic activity
through apical tubule IGF-I–receptors. Tubular-fluid IGF-I
may raise the increase in collagen secretion by tubular cells,
which may contribute to interstitial extracellular matrix accu￾mulation and scar formation. Thus, the glomerular ultrafiltra￾tion of IGF-I in the nephrotic syndrome may contribute to the
tubulo–interstitial fibrosis that facilitates progressive renal fail￾ure in chronic nephrotic glomerular diseases.
