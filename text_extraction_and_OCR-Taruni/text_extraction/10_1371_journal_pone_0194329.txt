Abstract
Objective
To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients
with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal
disease compared to no treatment.
Design
This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating pre￾viously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe
and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in
the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty com￾bined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model
parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER
French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each
treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence inter￾vals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
gained.
Patients
The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of
them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage
(portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3
stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated

cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage
4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal
impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.
Intervention
Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared
to no-treatment.
Results
EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1
years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment
because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost￾utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.
Conclusions
This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease
evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon
and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted
life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C geno￾type 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of
the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of
€20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease
compared to no treatment.
Introduction
Chronic hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) which can lead to
cirrhosis in 10–20% of cases, in the absence of treatment at a median time of 10 to 30 years or
even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with an annual incidence of 1 to 5% in patients with cir￾rhosis. In France, genotype 1 is the most common (61%). Hepatitis C is more common in
patients with renal disease than in the general population due to nosocomial transmission dur￾ing dialysis or blood transfusion that occurred before 1994 [1]. A French study published in
2011 [2], conducted among 4,718 patients in 56 dialysis centers estimated the overall preva￾lence of 7.7% among hemodialysis patients (95% confidence interval of [6.9; 8.5]). In patients
with concomitant chronic renal failure and chronic hepatitis C, there is an increased risk of
all-cause mortality and mortality from liver disease. This increased risk is associated with the
negative impact of HCV on renal function. Kidney disease is the cause of the most common
mortality in patients with HCV: The mortality at 10 years in patients with renal disease is
between 33 and 49% [3, 4].
The main purpose of the HCV treatment is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR),
defined as undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) 12 weeks after end of treatment. This
viral eradication is seen as a valid marker of virological cure correlated with reduction in all￾cause mortality [5].

as detailed online in the guide for authors.

Elbasvir (EBR, NS5A inhibitor)/grazoprevir (GZR, NS3/4A protease inhibitor) differs from
some other direct acting antiviral because of its extra renal clearance (>90%) and a different
profile in terms of drug interaction. The fixed dose combination regimen of EBR/GZR for 12
weeks as a single daily dose was recently found to be safe and achieved high rates of SVR across
the CKD patient subgroups included in the study in a multicenter randomized phase 2/3 dou￾ble-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial (C-SURFER trial [6],www.clinicaltrials.gov
NCT02092350), consisting of 235 treatment naïve or experienced chronic HCV genotype 1
patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, including patients undergoing hemodialy￾sis, with or without cirrhosis.
Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness 12 weeks of EBR/GZR in the treatment of
patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1 and chronic renal failure stage 4 or 5 (creati￾nine clearance <30 mL / min / 1.73 m2
) including patients on dialysis.
Methods
The analysis was based upon a cost-utility HCV-CKD model which included both medical and
economic criteria from a collective (“all payers”) perspective.
Treatment comparators
The clinical and economic impact of using EBR/GZR was compared to no treatment. The
rationale for this choice was based on 1) the latest recommendations of the French Association
for Liver study AFEF [7] in 2015 in which EBR/GZR regimen is the only recommended treat￾ment for stage 4–5 CKD and HCV genotype 1 patients; and 2) the lack of robust clinical data
assessing the efficacy and safety for other direct-acting antivirals without interferon and ribavi￾rin in this subpopulation of HCV patients. French clinical experts have validated the "no treat￾ment strategy" as standard of care, based on the June 2015 recommendations [7] updated in
February 2016 by AFEF and the latest communications at AASLD congress in November
2015. In genotype 1 patients with a creatinine clearance <30 ml / min / 1.73m2, treatment
with elbasvir-grazoprevir for 12 weeks without ribavirin is the recommended regimen since
June 2015 according to the recommendations of the AFEF [7]. The updated February 2016
recommendations issued by AFEF [4] confirm, with a high level of evidence, the role of elbas￾vir-grazoprevir as a reference treatment in HCV genotype 1 patients with severe or terminal
renal insufficiency.
In the core model (US model) [8], efficacy of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) [8,9,10] and
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) was based on the results of a meta-analysis
[11,12]. We did not consider peg-IFN/RBV because for patients with CKD 4–5 stages and kid￾ney transplant this regimen is not tolerated and other treatments are not available. This is vali￾dated by French clinical experts.
Model overview: A lifetime homogeneous Markov model
The modeling approach complied with the French National Authority for Health (Haute
Autorite´ de Sante´—HAS) and the CHEERS guidelines [13,14]. The lifetime homogeneous
Markov model structure was based on observed data from the C-SURFER trial and patient
characteristics from the HEPATHER French cohort “Therapeutic options for hepatitis B and
C: a French cohort” which is a national multicenter prospective observational cohort study of
subjects with past or present viral hepatitis B or C (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01953458).
The C-SURFER trial and the HEPATHER French cohort received ethical approval. The
C-SURFER clinical trial was done at 68 centres in the USA, Argentina, Australia, Canada,
Estonia, France, Israel, South Korea, Lithuania, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden in accordance

with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines,
and other regulations governing clinical study conduct. The protocol was approved by an
independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each participating site. All
patients provided written informed consent. Written informed consent has been obtained too
from each patient before enrollment in the French HEPATHER cohort. The protocol is con￾ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and French law for biomedical research
and approved by the "CPP Ile de France 3" Ethics Ccommittee (Agreement Number: 2943).
The cohort is conducted in agreement with the Loi informatique et liberte´s (January 6, 1978,
modified by the July 1, 1994 law and finalized by the August 6, 2004 law).
The model was programmed using Visual Basic Application with the Excel1 2007 software.
The chronic HCV and chronic kidney disease (CKD) model is a discrete-time, state-transition
Markov model programmed in Microsoft Excel1 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). The
model was fully parameterized to run the base case and sensitivity analyses. One-way deter￾ministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were imple￾mented Visual Basic macros. The model combined major complications of both CKD and
liver diseases. The health states for CKD were defined following the National Kidney Founda￾tion Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) guidelines which are based
on kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To take into account the increased risk
of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death from HCV infection among CKD
patients, we adjusted the baseline CKD progression probabilities and other-cause mortality
using hazard rates obtained by comparing progression and mortality rates among HCV
infected with rates among patients without HCV.
Model description
The HCV model is a multi-cohort Markov model that simulated each cohort using the natural
history of progression of HCV disease through a lifetime horizon. The structure of HCV and
liver complications model was based on previously published and validated Markov cohort
model [8,9,10].
Each cohort was determined by the following risk factors or demographic characteristics:
age, sex (male/female), and baseline fibrosis score (F0–F4). The model’s structure is based on
the following 10 health states: no fibrosis (F0), portal fibrosis without septa (F1), portal fibrosis
with few septa (F2), numerous septa without fibrosis (F3), compensated cirrhosis (F4), decom￾pensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplant (LT), and patient’s
baseline fibrosis stage before treatment and achievement of sustained virological response
(“SVR, F0–F3” and “SVR, F4”) (Fig 1).
An SVR is considered a cure for patients who were originally non-cirrhotic (i.e., baseline
fibrosis score of F0, F1, F2 or F3). Previously cirrhotic patients (i.e., baseline fibrosis score of
F4) are assumed to have an excess risk of DC and HCC even if they achieved SVR. Thus, the
SVR states are collapsed into 2 major groups (F0-F3,F4) instead of 5 health states (F0,F1,F2,F3,
F4).
Progression to DC only occurs in cirrhotic patients (health states of compensated cirrhosis),
and the health state DC which consists of multiple outcomes (i.e., ascites, variceal hemorrhage,
and encephalopathy) is aggregated into one. Moreover, the DC, HCC, and liver LT states were
not separated into two states (for example, DC and post DC) as was done in some recent mod￾els [8,9,10] so as to account more accurately for different mortality rates, costs or utilities of
DC, HCC, and LT during the first year and subsequent years. However, several old and recent
studies shared similar streamlined HCV model’s structure where each of these health states is
aggregated into only one state. Examples include Najafzadeh et al [15], McEwan et al [16],

Gissel et al [17], Leleu et al [18], Younossi [19], and Zhang et al [20]. Progression to HCC only
occurs in cirrhotic patients (health states of compensated or decompensated cirrhosis). This
excludes the risk of HCC even among patients with the F3 state. This assumption seems
acceptable considering the very low frequency of this transition [21]. Patients in chronic HCV
health states (including the states of mild HCV F0 and F1) cannot spontaneously clear HCV.
There is no progression to more severe health states (i.e., cirrhosis) during therapy or subse￾quent follow-up for patients who respond to treatment. Patients who do not respond to ther￾apy can progress to more severe health states during therapy or subsequent follow-up. An SVR
is considered a cure for patients who were originally non-cirrhotic (i.e., baseline fibrosis score
of F0, F1, F2 or F3). These patients are also assumed to be at no risk for reactivation of HCV
infection or re-infection with HCV. Previously cirrhotic patients (i.e., baseline fibrosis score of
F4) are assumed to have an excess risk of DC and HCC even if they achieved SVR. Thus, the
SVR states are collapsed into 2 major groups (F0-F3,F4) instead of 5 health states (F0,..F4). It’s
the reason why regression of fibrosis post-SVR is not modeled.
The CKD structure of the combined model builds on the framework of previous models
[22,23,24,25,26,27] (Fig 2).
The health states for CKD were defined following the National Kidney Foundation
K/DOQI guidelines. CKD stages considered in the model are: CKD4 (GFR 15–29 ml/min/
1.73 m2), CKD5 (GFR < 15 ml/min/ 1.73 m2). In addition, we also include separate health
states for hemodialysis (HD) and kidney transplantation (KT).
The combined model consists of 40 mutually exclusive states (Table 1) representing CKD
status (CKD4, CKD5, HD, and KT) and liver disease conditions (SVR-F0–F3; SVR-F4, F0, F1,
F2, F3, F4, DC, HCC, and LT). In addition, it tracks separately three types of mortality: ESLD
mortality, ESRD mortality, and other-causes mortality. The model used an annual Markov
cycle to predict the incidence and progression of CKD and liver diseases and related complica￾tions in a cohort of patients stratified by the following baseline characteristics: sex, age, liver
fibrosis status, and CKD status.
The cohort of patients at the model entry was defined by age and sex and distributed
according to CKD 4–5 stages, hemodialysis treatment, and hepatic fibrosis stages previously

defined (F0, F1, F2, F3, and F4). The renal insufficient stage 4 (severe renal insufficiency) or 5
(end-stage renal insufficiency) patients are supposed to be treated for chronic hepatitis C at
the beginning of the simulation. The results of sustained virological response (SVR) of EBR/
GZR treatment were applied to the treated patients and set as null for the strategy “No HCV
treatment”. The Markov states “ESLD Mortality”, “ESRD Mortality”, and “Other-causes Mor￾tality” are absorbent states. In each health state a transition towards the state “Other-causes
Mortality” is possible. “ESRD Mortality” health state was assigned to the CKD5, hemodialysis
(HD) or kidney transplantation (KT) health states only.
Baseline population characteristics
To generate the data of the simulated population in the French context, a study was done in
partnership with the ANRS (France REcherche Nord&sud Sida-vih He´patites), INSERM trans￾fert (Institut national de la sante´ et de la recherche me´dicale) and MSD, using an extraction
of the ANRS CO22 HEPATHER database in February 5, 2016, on patients included in the
HEPATHER cohort. The statistical analysis involved 99 patients and showed no significant dif￾ference at the 5% level regardless the genotype 1 and genotype 4 patient characteristics. Patient
characteristics are described in Table 2. The mean age of these French HCV-CKD patients was
of 59.6 years old and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibro￾sis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few
septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (com￾pensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment
stage 4, 33% a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% with terminal severe renal impairment
stage 5 treated by dialysis. The initial cohort was assigned to CKD4, CKD5 and CKD5 with
dialysis health states combined to hepatic fibrosis stage of the patient (F0 to F4) according to
the proportion of renal insufficient patients with hepatitis C at stage F0, F1, F2, F3 or F4.
Model inputs and transition probabilities
HCV model parameters were obtained from previous published studies and French registries
(Table 3). CKD model inputs were derived from a targeted review of the published literature
(Table 4).

health states for hemodialysis (HD) and kidney transplantation (KT).

Clinical efficacy
Clinical data source was obtained from the multicentre randomized-controlled C-Surfer study
[6] which compared the impact of EBR/GZR regimen and of no-treatment option on the SVR
rate. In the pre-specified primary population, the proportion of patients achieving SVR 12
weeks after the completion of therapy was 99% (115/116).
Utilities
The baseline analysis was a cost-utility analysis. Only the utilities related to chronic hepatitis C
were used in the base case analysis.
A literature review found no data on utilities of the combined health states related to the
concomitance of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. The quality of life data from
the C-SURFER clinical trial [6] did not use a validated utility score. We considered only utility
values for chronic hepatitis C with a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of utility decre￾ments associated with CKD [32].
Disutility related to the anti-HCV treatments was not considered.
The utility values are detailed in Table 5.
The assumption that all patients achieving SVR have a quality of life (QoL) of 1.00 could be
challenged. Different studies have shown a slight increase in QoL, but without reaching “per￾fect health” [30,31]. Considering these references, we performed a scenario analysis consider￾ing a 0.82 utility index for SVR state, whatever the fibrosis stage. This value is equal to the

utility index used for F0-F1 health states. For this scenario, the ICUR increases at €26,719 per
QALY gained. Despite this very conservative scenario (which does not favor the assessed treat￾ment), EBR/GZR is cost-effective for the studied population.
Mortality
The combined HCV-CKD model used ESLD mortality, ESRD mortality, and other causes mor￾tality. To take into account the rising risk over time of progressing to end-stage CKD states or
of dying from chronic hepatitis C for CKD patients, baseline probabilities in the model were
adjusted to the progression of CKD and mortality not specific to chronic hepatitis C or chronic
kidney disease (all causes mortality) using hazard ratios obtained by comparing the CKD pro￾gression and mortality rates between CKD patients with HCV and CKD patients without
HCV. Data sources for specific mortality and all causes mortality are defined in Tables 3 and 4.
Costs
Costs were estimated for both liver and kidney diseases, by health sate. Costs (inpatient, outpa￾tient, and pharmaceutical) for chronic liver disease patients are shown in Table 6.

These data allowed the calculation of weighted mean utilities and costs balanced between utilities and costs for DC, HCC, LT 1st year states and DC/HCC/LT following
years states. Calculation was as follows: These probabilities 1st year and following years also made it possible to estimate the lower and upper probability values for
ESLD-related death around the average values (1st year and following years) to advanced DC/HCC/LT states published by Leleu et al. 2015 [19].

Costs of managing CKD patients by stage are shown in Table 7.
Model analysis
The model was run for each of the specified patient profile. An overall weighted average result
was generated based on distribution of the patient characteristics. The baseline discount rate
was 4%.
We calculated lifetime risk of liver disease complications, life expectancy in discounted
years, discounted treatment costs, discounted health state costs, and discounted QALYs.
We applied within-cycle correction to all cumulative outcomes using Simpson’s 1/3rd rule
and tested results sensitivity to the correction method by applying the standard application
of half-cycle correction method [33]. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we calculated
costs and QALYs over the remaining duration of a patient’s lifetime. The incremental
cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of EBR/GZR regimen relative to a no treatment was calculated by
dividing incremental total discounted costs by incremental total discounted number of
QALYs.
Base-case analysis. Aggregated results are presented for genotype 1 patients and general￾ized for genotype 4 patients (see Conclusion).

Subgroup analysis. Results are also provided separately for each fibrosis stage. The
robustness of these results was tested by changing baseline demographic characteristics such as
sex (i.e., men only and women only) and age distribution.
Deterministic sensitivity analysis. We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses for several
parameters showing the effect of varying these inputs on the ICUR of EBR/GZR treatment
strategies compared with standard of care (SoC). We varied progression rates, efficacy, unit
costs, utility weights; discount rates using ranges defined in S1 Table (cf. Supporting
Information).
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In order to quantify the impact of parameter uncer￾tainty for transition probabilities, SVR, costs and utility weights on the ICUR of EBR/GZR
treatment strategy compared with no treatment, we performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis
(PSA). Using Monte Carlo simulations methods, we drew 1,000 random samples from pre￾defined distributions (S2 Table).
Parameters of the Gamma and Beta distributions were estimated using the method of
moments that relates each parameter to the mean and standard deviation. We used the base￾case values as estimates of the mean. Standard errors were estimated from confidence intervals
or ranges.
Results of the PSA were summarized using descriptive statistics and cost-effectiveness
acceptability curves (CEAC) [21]. The CEAC summarizes uncertainties of the cost-effective￾ness results showing the probability a regimen is cost effective as a function of willing-to-pay
for a QALY gained.
Model predictions and validation
The model face validity was checked by comparing its structure to previous published models
[8, 23,24]. Several tests were built into the model for verification and to ensure internal validity.
We cross-validated the model by comparing its prediction of a 20-year probability of compen￾sated cirrhosis to previous models [34,35]. These models predicted the 20-year probability of
compensated cirrhosis among untreated 44-years-old patients with mild chronic HCV
between 27% and 29%. Assuming that the respective distribution of mild HCV between F0
and F1 is 35% and 65%, the model projected the 20-year probability of compensated cirrhosis
at 23.9%.

Results
Base-case analysis
The discounted results of life years and QALYs considering the lifetime simulation are pre￾sented in Table 8.
The total number of QALYs was higher for elbasvir-grazoprevir because of a better utility
on HCV health states and of a lower all causes mortality raised by complications related to
hepatic and renal insufficiencies.
The other clinically important results simulated by the model are presented in Table 9.
The results of Table 9 were validated by French clinical experts, especially for HCV disease￾related mortality (%), CKD disease-related mortality (%), other causes mortality (%), patients
with kidney transplant (%), patients with decompensated cirrhosis (%), patients with hepato￾cellular carcinoma (%), and patients with liver transplant (%). The lowest mortality related to
hepatic insufficiency was associated to elbasvir-grazoprevir. Patients treated with elbasvir-gra￾zoprevir live longer (Table 9) and die later from complications related to renal insufficiency
and cardiovascular diseases.
Table 10 shows the discounted cost effectiveness results. The incremental cost-utility ratio
(ICUR) of elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus standard of care (no treatment) was €15,212
per QALY in the base case analysis.

Subgroup analysis
The results of subgroup analysis are presented in Table 11.
Results of this subgroup analysis are provided separately for each fibrosis stage (all CKD
stages included). The robustness of these results was tested by changing baseline demographic
characteristics such as sex (i.e., men only and women only) and age distribution. The underly￾ing distribution of the F and CKD states of these patients is defined as follow:
Distribution of METAVIR fibrosis stages at baseline (all CKD stages included): F0: 0,223;
F1: 0,241; F2: 0,071; F3: 0,214; F4: 0,250.
Distribution of CKD stages at baseline (all F stages included): CKD4: 0,300; CKD5: 0,330;
CKD5-Haemodialysis (HD): 0,370; CKD5-Kidney transplant (KT): 0,000.
For this subgroup analysis, the value for F0/. . ./F4 was parameterized to 1, and 0 for the
other F stages. This subgroup analysis was required by HAS during technical early meetings.
To distribute the patients according to their concomitant F and CKD state was not possible,
because of the unavailability of these data from the French HEPATHER cohort. This limitation
is highlighted in the Discussion section.
Deterministic sensitivity analysis
The tornado diagram (Fig 3) shows the ranking of input parameters according to their sensi￾tivity on the ICUR.
The result was most sensitive to the variation of the CKD progression risk (hazard rate)
given HCV (all stages). The ICUR varied of approximately €14,252, when accounting from a
hazard rate of CKD progression given HCV of 2.39 (ICUR of €10,017) to a weighted annual
mean cost for kidney transplant of €85,079 (ICUR of €24,269). The next three more influential
parameters were the hazard rate of death given HCV (all stages), the mean age of the patient at
the beginning of the simulation, and the weighted annual mean cost for liver transplant. How￾ever, the variation in ICUR obtained by changing these three parameters was less pronounced
than for the two first parameters (differences between upper and lower limits of nearly €7,700,
€7,300 and €3,400, respectively).
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis
The PSA cost-effectiveness plane (Fig 4) describes the difference in effectiveness (QALYs) on
the x-axis and the difference in cost (Euro 2015) on the y-axis between the two compared strat￾egies, for 1,000 simulations in each group.
100% of points (ICUR) of the simulation were located in the North-East quadrant of the
cost-effectiveness plane. The North-East quadrant is the era where EBR/GZR is more effective
and more costly than the comparator. So, the ICUR expressed as Euro per QALY has to be esti￾mate. The acceptability curves (Fig 4) shows that the probability of being cost-effective for the

assessed strategy was higher than the comparator (no treatment) starting from a willingness to
pay of €15,300 per QALY gained (probability of 50%). For gaining 30% of confidence (from

monetary benefit (NMB) according to various levels of willingness to pay by the community to
gain a QALY.
The strategy that maximized the net monetary benefit up to a willingness to pay less than
€ 15,000 (lambda) was the reference strategy (no treatment). Beyond this level of willingness to
pay to win a QALY, the assessed strategy elbasvir-grazoprevir maximized the net monetary
benefit.
Discussion
This cost-utility model is, to our knowledge, the first considering the evolution of both chronic
hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease when HAS assessment has been done. We found that
using elbasvir-grazoprevir to treat HCV infected patients with chronic kidney disease was cost
effective for payers willing to pay above €15,000/QALY. The treatment was increasingly effi￾cient in the more advanced stages of the renal insufficiency.
Considering the objective of public health it is thus important to treat HCV-CKD patients
as early as possible. As the CKD progression was considered we obtained a conservative result
of cost-effectiveness in HCV patients, because patients treated by elbasvir-grazoprevir live lon￾ger than untreated patients and thus have a raising risk over time to develop some complica￾tions related to chronic kidney disease. As a consequence, to take into account the renal
insufficiency progression in the base case analysis would make it possible to consider this sce￾nario as a conservative scenario.
A paper published by Elbasha et al. (December, 2016) [36] considered the same objective of
our study but in different settings (US settings). The ICUR of EBR/GZR compared with No
Treatment was of $13 200/QALY, which is very similar to our findings, despite significant dif￾ferences in Health care settings.
Regarding the availability of treatment comparators, no available information has been
found for Glecaprevir /Pibrentasvir. Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir is Abbvie’s treatment for which
we had no information at the time of the HAS assessment. We have considered whether the
AbbVie Phase III clinical trial could have been considered in relation to the population we are
modeling. Unfortunately, we had methodological limitations preventing to include this

regimen into a network meta-analysis to take it into account in our cost-utility study. Indeed,
the web link (Last Update Posted: February 2, 2018) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT03069365 states that “No Study Results Posted on ClinicalTrials.gov for this Study”
(access online: 2018/02/19). In addition, the study design can be considered having limitations
such as non-randomization and non-masking. Moreover, the comparator of the above study is
not defined.
For all these reasons we could not include this treatment in the analysis.
Transition probabilities are mainly taken from the published paper of Deuffic-Burban et al.
2014 [28] which is very suited to French settings for the simulated population. This published
study has been validated by HAS for populating the French cost-utility study. Potential differ￾ences in transition probabilities in comparison to other models [36] are taken into account
through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, which consider ranges of values
for each transition probability and subsequent variation of ICUR highlighted by the tornado
chart (Fig 3), the Cost-Utility plane (Fig 4), and the multi-options acceptability frontier (Fig 5).
For the “Risk of progression of CKD given HCV (all stages)” in the current model, a hazard
rate of 1.7 is used. This hazard rate is taken from the published meta-analysis of Fabrizi et al.
2014 [30]. This source has been validated by the scientific board of the cost-utility study for the
following reasons: This is a meta-analysis of 7 longitudinal observational studies including
890,560 patients with chronic hepatitis C and severe end-stage chronic renal failure. The objec￾tive of this study was to estimate the statistical relationship, measured by hazard ratios (HR),
between HCV seropositivity and the reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eDFG),
which is a marker deterioration of renal function. The results of HR are not available for each
stage of liver fibrosis, but in all stages. The adjusted mean HR is estimated at 1.70 with a 95%
confidence interval between 1.20 and 2.39. Thus, it is considered in the base case analysis of
the model that the presence of chronic hepatitis C in patients with renal insufficiency increases
the risk of progression from severe renal insufficiency (stage 4) to end-stage renal failure (stage
5), and from end stage renal failure to hemodialysis, of 1.70, compared to the natural course of
renal failure without hepatitis C. The value of 1.32 published for the US model [36] is included
in the 95% CI values which were taken into account in deterministic and probabilistic sensitiv￾ity analyses.
The assumption that there are no costs of care in SVR F0 to F4 could be challenged. Most
patients, especially those with F2, F3 and F4 liver damage could continue to require health
care. For testing this assumption, we performed a scenario analysis considering same values
for SVR F0 to F4 costs and F0 to F4 costs (without SVR), for each fibrosis stage (annual cost of
373 € for SVR-F0/F1/F2, 431 € for SVR-F3, and 1 560 € for SVR-F4). This scenario is very con￾servative as it considers that SVR has no impact on annual costs of care. For this scenario, the
ICUR increases at €16,772 per QALY gained. Despite this very conservative scenario (which
does not favor the assessed treatment), EBR/GZR is cost-effective for the studied population.
On top of that, for being much more conservative, we also considered a 0.82 utility index for
SVR state, whatever the fibrosis stage. This value is equal to the utility index used for F0-F1
health states. For this scenario, the ICUR increases at €29,460 per QALY gained. Despite this
very concervative scenario for the product, EBR/GZR is still cost-effective for the studied
population.
Some of the main limitations of our model could favor the assessed treatment, as the the
absence of utility decrement for CKD. The non inclusion of potential stopping rules for HCV
treatment is another limitation. The initial distribution of patients (at baseline) was considered
distinctly for the liver (F0 to F4 fibrosis stages) and for the kidney disease (CKD stages 4–5 and
5 with dialysis), and the model therefore calculated the benefit of the treatment for two instead
of one statistical individuals; a distribution of HCV-CKD combined health states was not

available from the HEPATHER French cohort. The current CKD model structure did not
make it possible for patients with CKD stage 4 to reach dialysis, but the C-Surfer clinical study
[6] showed that a few CKD stage 4 patients with GFR < 20 ml/min were dialyzed; this could
be considered as a non-conservative limitation. The costs related to ESLD mortality, ESRD
mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality were not taken into account, but the determin￾istic sensitivity analysis showed that ICUR decreased from €15,212, with a conservative null
death cost, to €14,313 if the HCV-related death cost was of €35,016 (i.e. the maximum cost
based on the literature [28]). The treatment cost related to the last month when patient
deceased [29] was of approximately €10,799 (standard deviation: €10,075) in CKD stage 5
patient (GFR < 15 ml/min/1,73m2) treated with hemodialysis. The potential limitation of con￾sidering a null death cost related to ESRD was thus balanced by the conservative approach sug￾gested into the base case analysis which also did not consider a death cost due to ESLD.
Indeed, the Markov states “ESLD Mortality”, “ESRD Mortality”, and “Other-causes Mortality”
are absorbent states and valued to zero cost, for being considered as a recommended scenario
by HAS.
In France, the reimbursement decision is based on clinical effectiveness and not on cost￾effectiveness outcomes. Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are assessed independently
and in parallel by different committees. The HAS, in giving its efficiency opinion, does not
make recommendations about reimbursement. The economic evaluation is one among other
criteria (e.g. added clinical benefit) that is used by the French Pricing Committee (CEPS) for
negotiating the price with the manufacturers. Since January 2016, in addition to the cost-effec￾tiveness analysis (CEA) submissions, budget impact analyses (BIAs) are required as part of effi￾ciency dossiers submitted by manufacturers for innovative drugs with an expected 2-year sales
revenue above €50 million. For EBR/GZR dossier, the expected 2-year sales revenue in the
studied population is below €50 million; thereby, a BIA was not required by HAS.
Conclusions
Treatment with elbasvir-grazoprevir was found to be cost effective in HCV-genotypes 1/4 and
CKD-stage 4–5 or 5 with dialysis patients. With a treatment cost of €29,402 for 12 weeks of
treatment, 100% of simulations were below €31,500 per QALY gained.
This study has the non-technical limitation of being sponsored by industry (the MSD Com￾pany). However, an external research organization (Statesia) was hired to handle indepen￾dently the adaptation of the simulation model and the data analysis to remove any possible
bias.
