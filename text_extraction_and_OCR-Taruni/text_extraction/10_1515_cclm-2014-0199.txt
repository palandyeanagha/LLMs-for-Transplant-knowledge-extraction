Role of presepsin for the evaluation of sepsis in 
the emergency department
Abstract: Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are among 
the most common conditions handled in the emergency 
department (ED). According to new Sepsis Guidelines, 
early diagnosis and treatment are the keys to improve sur￾vival. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin 
(PCT) levels, when associated with documented or sus￾pected infection, are now part of the definitions of sepsis. 
Blood culture is the gold standard method for detecting 
microorganisms but it requires too much time for results 
to be known. Sensitive biomarkers are required for early 
diagnosis and as indexes of prognosis sepsis. CRP is one 
of the acute phase proteins synthesized by the liver: it has 
a great sensitivity but a very poor specificity for bacterial 
infections. Moreover, the evolution of sepsis does not cor￾relate with CRP plasma changes. In recent years PCT has 
been widely used for sepsis differential diagnosis, because 
of its close correlation with infections, but it still retains 
some limitations and false positivity (such as in multiple 
trauma and burns). Soluble CD14 subtype (sCD14-ST), also 
known as presepsin, is a novel and promising biomarker 
that has been shown to increase significantly in patients 
with sepsis, in comparison to the healthy population. 
Studies pointed out the capability of this biomarker for 
diagnosing sepsis, assessing the severity of the disease 
and providing a prognostic evaluation of patient outcome. 
In this mini review we mainly focused on presepsin: we 
evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic roles in patients 
presenting to the ED with systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS), suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Introduction
Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are unquestionably 
some of the major healthcare problems, affecting millions 
of people each year worldwide, responsible for one death 
every four, and increasing in incidence [1–3]. Prompt 
diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial 
chemotherapy is of utmost importance in reducing mor￾bidity and mortality associated with sepsis [4]. Sepsis is a 
systemic deleterious host response to infection, possibly 
leading to severe sepsis (acute organ dysfunction second￾ary to documented or suspected infection) or septic shock 
(severe sepsis plus hypotension not reversed with fluid 
resuscitation). According to the most recent guidelines, 
published by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [5], early 
recognition of these conditions and speed and appropri￾ateness of therapy in the initial hours after presentation 
considerably influence the outcomes of septic patients. 
Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) 
values more than two standard deviations (SD) above the 
normal levels, if associated with infection documented or 
only suspected, are now part of the definition of sepsis [5, 6].
Blood culture is the gold standard method for detect￾ing the presence of microorganism in the bloodstream. 
However, it has limited usefulness for early detection of 
infection because it usually requires several days for results 
to be known [7]. Blood culture may also be plagued by 
some false negative cases, especially in patients undergo￾ing antibiotic therapy. This can lead to a delay in antibiotic 
administration and consequently to increased mortality. 
Moreover, sepsis can be suspected in the absence of an 
obvious infectious source, particularly in elderly people 
who often present with non-specific signs (weakness, 
confusion, dyspnea and organ dysfunction, such as acute 
renal failure and acute coronary syndrome). In conclusion,

sensitive biomarkers are needed for diagnosis and progno￾sis of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, particularly in 
such cases of atypical presentations [8].
Selection of studies
We analyzed the most recent and important studies 
that reported results about presepsin: we systematically 
searched PubMed, Ovid and Scopus databases in a time 
period from July 1995 to February 2014 using the term “pre￾sepsin”. Retrospective, prospective studies and reviews 
were taken into account, avoiding unpublished literature 
and papers published only in abstract form.
The area under the curve (AUC) was used to show 
diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. A p-value  < 0.05 was 
considered to be significant.
Traditional biomarkers
CRP is one of the acute phase inflammation proteins syn￾thesized by the liver; CPR levels increase 6 h after inter￾leukin 6 (IL-6) stimulation and has a half-life of 20–24 h 
[8]. Its main advantage is its great sensitivity as soon as 
an inflammatory process affects the human body, but 
unfortunately it is weakly specific for bacterial infections; 
moreover, the evolution of sepsis is poorly correlated with 
changes in serum CRP level [9].
PCT is the pro-hormone of calcitonin: it is synthe￾tized by thyroid cells. During any pro-inflammatory 
stimuli, many tissue and immune cells attain the ability 
to produce PCT [10, 11]. This biomarker increases within 
4 h from the start of the innate immunity cascade, peaking 
within 6–8 h [9]. Although PCT has an established role as 
a biomarker in septic patients and has been shown to cor￾relate closely with infection, it has some limitations: it 
rises transiently in patients with non-septic conditions 
and systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS) 
(e.g., trauma, surgery, heatstroke).
However, PCT can be used as an index of progres￾sion to septic shock and multi-organ failure [12]. Two 
recent studies tried to establish a PCT-algorithm useful 
to manage sepsis antimicrobial therapy based on plasma 
PCT levels changes with conflicting results. Bouadma and 
colleagues showed that this algorithm could reduce anti￾biotic exposure without apparent adverse outcomes [13], 
while Jansen et al. showed a prolonged admission to the 
intensive care units without any improvement in the sur￾vival rate [14].
sCD14-ST or presepsin
Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) is a glycoprotein 
expressed on the membrane surface of monocytes and 
macrophages (mCD14) and serves as a high-affinity recep￾tor for complexes of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), a com￾pound from the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, 
and LPS-binding proteins (LPBs). CD14 activates the toll￾like receptor 4 (TLR4)-specific proinflammatory signaling 
cascade in order to start the inflammatory reaction against 
microorganisms [7, 15]. The soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) 
is directly secreted by hepatocytes: during inflammation 
plasma proteases activate a cleavage of sCD14 in order to 
generate a truncated form named sCD14-subtype (sCD14-
ST), well known as presepsin.
Membrane CD14 may also function as a receptor for 
peptidoglycan, a cell wall component of Gram-positive 
and some Gram-negative bacteria [7].
Presepsin is normally present in very low concentra￾tions in the serum of healthy individuals and has been 
shown to increase in response to bacterial infections, 
according to the severity of the disease [16]; however, 
information about presepsin concentrations in specific 
populations are very poor. A French study pointed out that 
presepsin concentrations increase with age and kidney 
dysfunction in the absence of any infectious sign. Then, 
an adapted threshold may be necessary in the elderly 
population and in the case of kidney impairment since the 
interpretation of presepsin levels could be misleading in 
these situations [17].
More recent studies confirmed presepsin as a prom￾ising biomarker in the diagnosis of sepsis, as well as for 
assessing the severity and predicting the outcome in septic 
patients [16, 18–21]. Furthermore, a rapid assay, based on 
the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay principle 
(called PATHFAST® Presepsin assay, Mitsubishi Chemical 
Medience Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), is now available 
and can be used on a point-of-care testing basis [22], thus 
allowing the emergency physician (EP) to get presepsin 
values in a short time from whole blood samples [23].
Diagnostic role and diagnostic 
accuracy
Several studies compared presepsin diagnostic power to 
that of PCT in detecting sepsis in patients presenting at 
the emergency department (ED) with a documented or 
suspected infection. Endo and colleagues demonstrated 
similar AUCs for presepsin and for PCT, 0.908 and 0.905, 

Pizzolato et al.: New biomarkers in the management of sepsis      1397
respectively, in their ability to differentiate between 
patients with bacterial and non-bacterial infections [21]. 
In another study the AUC of presepsin was lower than PCT 
(0.70 vs. 0.87) in a cohort of septic patients [20], even if pre￾sepsin was able to significantly differentiate sepsis from 
SIRS (p = 0.02), and severe sepsis/septic shock from SIRS 
(p < 0.001). In contrast to the latter study, Liu et al. reported 
that presepsin is a very powerful biomarker, superior to PCT 
for the diagnosis of sepsis and severe sepsis (AUC for prese￾psin and PCT were 0.82 and 0.72, respectively, in the case of 
sepsis and 0.84 and 0.74 in the case of severe sepsis) [19].
Few studies evaluated the role of presepsin in pre￾dicting the presence of bacteriemia. An Italian study 
evaluated this relationship in a surgical population 
(cadaveric-donor organ transplant recipients and abdom￾inal surgery patients). Novelli et  al. showed that high 
presepsin concentrations could indicate the presence of 
an infection despite clinical absence of septic signs and 
symptoms when a blood test for presepsin was performed. 
The presence of infection was confirmed days after study 
enrollment by positive blood cultures [24]. Some authors 
found that CRP, PCT and presepsin serum values were 
significantly higher in the bacteremic population without 
any differences among the blood culture-positive, -nega￾tive and mixed flora groups [7]. In a pediatric oncology 
population with febrile neutropenia, PCT levels were sig￾nificantly higher in the sepsis/bacteriemia group (where 
infections were further confirmed with positive blood 
cultures) compared to the fever of unknown origin (FUO) 
group (with negative blood cultures) whereas presepsin 
concentrations did not differ between the two groups [25].
Recent studies compared presepsin values to Sequen￾tial Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiol￾ogy and Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores in patients 
with sepsis, finding a close correlation between plasma 
biomarker levels and the severity of the scores [16]. Endo 
and colleagues confirmed previous studies: presepsin 
levels correlated with the sepsis diagnosis at hospital 
admission and with the monitoring of sepsis during the 
follow-up. During follow-up, marker serum levels were 
associated with the decreasing trend in SOFA and APACHE 
II, while other tested biomarkers (such as PCT and CRP) 
were not [26]. Ulla et  al. found a significant correlation 
only between presepsin values at the first medical evalua￾tion in ED and SOFA scores [20].
The potential influence of presepsin in sepsis-induced 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was studied 
by considering 11 variables [antithrombin activity, coagu￾lative protein C, thrombomodulin, platelet counts, pro￾thrombin time-international normalized ratio, D-dimer, 
presepsin, PCT, IL-6, CRP and white blood cell (WBC) 
count]: presepsin and coagulative protein C (PC) was the 
best association to predict the severity of sepsis-induced 
DIC. The AUCs for the combination of presepsin and PC in 
the patients with and without sepsis and DIC were 0.913 
and 0.880, respectively [27].
Few studies evaluated the usefulness of presepsin 
in the surgical environment. Popov et  al. defined the 
biomarker’s ability in predicting clinical complications 
in cardiac surgical patients (acquired heart valvular dis￾eases with cardiopulmonary bypass) during perioperative 
period: increased postoperative levels of presepsin were 
associated with a major risk of infection complications 
and untoward outcomes [28]. Some authors evaluated 
presepsin in preoperative diagnosing of abdominal sepsis: 
the AUC to discriminate SIRS from sepsis was 0.996. Prese￾psin showed a better diagnostic accuracy when compared 
to PCT, CRP and WBC count [29].
Cakir Madenci et al. underlined the significant diag￾nostic role of presepsin in diagnosis and follow-up of 
sepsis in burn patients. The AUC for detecting sepsis was 
0.834, very similar to that of already known biomarkers 
like PCT and CRP (0.847 and 0.819, respectively) [30].
Diagnostic performance of presepsin was also evalu￾ated in the detection of sepsis-related fatalities using post￾mortem femoral blood compared to PCT and CRP. Results 
indicated that postmortem serum PCT, CRP and presepsin 
levels allowed septic cases to be identified (AUCs were 
0.89, 0.96 and 0.84, respectively). Postmortem biochemi￾cal investigations failed in identifying underlying bacte￾rial infections and hidden sepsis status in the control 
group: none of the subjects included in this group had a 
documented, clinical diagnosis of sepsis in vivo and none 
had been admitted to the hospital prior to death [31].
Prognostic role and prognostic 
accuracy
Recent studies correlated presepsin serum values with 
mortality: Ulla et al. demonstrated a significantly correla￾tion (p = 0.04) between high presepsin values at the first 
medical evaluation in ED and 60-day in hospital mortal￾ity, data not confirmed with PCT levels [20]. According 
to Masson and colleagues, high biomarker values, with￾drawn at 1, 2 and 7 days after study enrollment, were inde￾pendently associated with the negative outcome during 
the hospital stay, on days 28 and 90 after study enroll￾ment, while PCT concentrations were not (AUCs of 0.69, 
0.70 and 0.74, respectively, on days 1, 2 and 7; vs. 0.56, 0.55 
and 0.64, respectively, for PCT) [32]. Presepsin prognostic 

1398      Pizzolato et al.: New biomarkers in the management of sepsis
power has also been studied in the context of burns: non￾survivors people had significant higher presepsin levels 
when compared to survivors (p < 0.0001). In these studies, 
PCT and CRP reached equivalent results (p < 0.0210 and 
p < 0.0008, respectively) [30].
Presepsin in neonatology
Despite every year almost one million newborns dying 
from infections, there are very few studies about presepsin 
in the neonatology population [9]. A great effort to reduce 
the neonatal mortality rate is put into looking for new 
biochemical markers. Nowadays PCT and CRP are used to 
manage critically ill newborns with sepsis: although they 
have good diagnostic and monitoring performances, they 
show very limited values for stratification and in predict￾ing outcomes. Among biomarkers, presepsin could be 
one of the most interesting and reliable candidates for 
sepsis management [9], specifically for early diagnosis, 
the classification into severity degrees, the prediction 
of complications and death [33]. Mussap et al. studied a 
group of critically preterm ill newborns with gestational 
age between 26 and 36 weeks, admitted for various severe 
diseases in the absence of documented sepsis: no correla￾tion was found between presepsin values and gestational 
age. Thus it seems reasonable to adopt a unique reference 
range for preterm population [34].
Conclusions
Sepsis represents a continuum from an inciting infec￾tious event and the consequent host-pathogen interac￾tion, possibly leading to hemodynamic consequences 
caused by pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and apo￾ptotic mediators [35]. In some cases sepsis can evolve into 
severe sepsis, when documented or suspected infection 
is associated with multiorgan involvement and failure, or 
even into septic shock, when hypotension becomes unre￾sponsive to fluid therapy and vasopressors are required. 
Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are common con￾ditions, very frequently recognized and handled (at least 
initially) in the ED: strong evidence suggests that early 
identification and prompt therapeutical intervention are 
beneficial in affecting outcome [36]. Early recognition of 
sepsis is not always straightforward and clinical signs 
at presentation can be misleading and very heterogene￾ous in the population, especially in patients present￾ing to the ED, due to frequent comorbidities or variable 
demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnic group). In 
the emergency setting therefore an urgent need for a reli￾able diagnostic procedure, allowing early discrimination 
between SIRS and sepsis, exists. Biomarkers, such as CRP 
and PCT, recently introduced among the diagnostic cri￾teria of sepsis [5], could contribute to promptly identify 
patients affected by sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock 
who could benefit from quick and appropriate therapy.
CRP demonstrated high sensitivity but very low speci￾ficity: it rises as soon as any inflammation process affects 
the human body but it has limited specificity for bacterial 
infections. PCT has gained a significant diagnostic role in 
this field, but this biomarker still retains some important 
limitations: it tends to rise transiently in non-septic condi￾tions and SIRS, e.g., invasive trauma, surgery, heatstroke 
and physical exercise [37].
Presepsin is a novel biomarker with high sensitivity 
and good specificity for sepsis, is readily available in the 
ED and significantly correlated to in-hospital mortality 
of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Prelimi￾nary findings provide a solid basis for its future appli￾cation even if more insights are needed concerning the 
pathophysiological conditions associated with presepsin 
release and a more extensive evaluation of presepsin as 
a biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock is advis￾able. The added value of this biomarker for clinical deci￾sion-making in terms of diagnosis, risk stratification and 
therapy monitoring should also be clarified [32]. There are 
few studies on the impact of this new biomarker on the 
antibiotic management of patients and larger studies are 
required in this field [38].
Key message
Due to the complexity of sepsis response, it is unlikely 
that a single biomarker will be sufficient for use in clinical 
practice. A combination of several sepsis biomarkers may 
be more effective, but this requires further investigations 
both on the clinical outcome and cost effectiveness of tra￾ditional markers associated with new markers [30]. The 
availability of easy and fast commercial methods for the 
automated measurement of sCD14-ST represents a chal￾lenge for the evaluation of a new reliable marker of sepsis 
in all age groups [33].
