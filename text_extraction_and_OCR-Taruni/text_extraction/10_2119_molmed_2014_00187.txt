INTRODUCTION
“Peculiar, elongated and sickle￾shaped” cells in the blood of a 20-year￾old dental student led Dr. James Herrick
to describe the first case of sickle cell
disease (SCD) in 1910 (1,2). The dental
student, Walter Clement Noel, had re￾peated hospital admissions for episodes
of pain accompanied by red cell hemoly￾sis. Noel died when he was only 32
years old from a respiratory illness,
likely acute chest syndrome (ACS) re￾lated to SCD. Unfortunately, frequent
pain and early deaths still characterize
the clinical course for many patients
with SCD today.
Since publication of this index case,
there have been great strides toward un￾derstanding the mechanistic underpin￾nings of SCD. In 1949, SCD was her￾alded as the first molecular disease after
the discovery of sickle hemoglobin by
Pauling et al. (3). The genetic basis for
this abnormal hemoglobin was later
found to be a missense mutation in the
β-globin gene, resulting in the substitu￾tion of a valine for glutamic acid at posi￾tion 6. This deoxy-sickle hemoglobin un￾dergoes structural changes that promote
its polymerization into long fibrils, dis￾torting the red cell into a crescent or
sickle shape. The sickle erythrocytes are
dehydrated, rigid and prone to hemoly￾sis. They occlude the microvasculature
causing acute, and critically important,
chronic tissue ischemia and injury. The
two most common acute morbidities in
patients with SCD, vaso-occlusive pain
crises (VOC) and ACS, are due to sud￾den occlusion of small vessels in the
bone marrow and lungs (4,5) On a
chronic basis, vaso-occlusion may dam￾age the lungs, kidneys or brain and ulti￾mately may lead to end-organ dysfunc￾tion (6). These acute and chronic
complications of vaso-occlusion account
for most deaths in patients with SCD in
the modern era (7).
Clinical care improvements for patients
with SCD have lagged behind the sci￾ence. During the two decades that fol￾lowed the identification of the hemoglo￾binopathy, only 50% of afflicted children
survived into adulthood (8). By the 1990s,
however, widespread mandatory new￾born screening and the routine adminis￾tration of penicillin to prevent pneumo￾coccal sepsis increased childhood
survival to over 90% (9,10). Then in 1998,

In the hydroxyurea era, insights into mechanisms downstream of erythrocyte sickling have led to new therapeutic approaches
for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapies have been developed that target vascular adhesion, inflammation and he￾molysis, including innovative biologics directed against P-selectin and invariant natural killer T cells. Advances in hematopoietic
stem cell transplant and gene therapy may also provide more opportunities for cures in the near future. Several clinical studies are
underway to determine the safety and efficacy of these new treatments. Novel approaches to treat SCD are desperately needed,
since current therapies are limited and rates of morbidity and mortality remain high.

ADVANCES IN SICKLE CELL THERAPIES
hydroxyurea became the only U.S. Food
and Drug Administration–approved
therapy for SCD (11). First described as a
potential therapy in 1984, hydroxyurea
enhances the production of fetal hemo￾globin production in sickle erythrocytes
(12). Clinical studies of hydroxyurea use
have demonstrated a decreased rate of
VOC, ACS and improved survival
(11,13,14).
Although hydroxyurea has been a
major therapeutic breakthrough for pa￾tients with SCD, additional treatments
are surely needed. Up to 50% of patients
will not benefit from hydroxyurea long
term because of poor response, toxicity,
nonaggressive therapists or noncompli￾ance (15). Potentially related to subopti￾mal hydroxyurea use, life expectancy for
patients with SCD remains around 50
years (7,16). The focus of this article will
be on advances in SCD therapies in the
hydroxyurea era, excluding further
progress in antisickling approaches. Re￾cent insights into the regulation of fetal
hemoglobin will likely lead to new thera￾pies in the near future, but a careful de￾scription of these developments is be￾yond the scope of this article (17). Since
the approval of hydroxyurea, a deeper
understanding of how sickle cells inter￾act with and affect other blood cells, the
vasculature and vital organs has uncov￾ered new ways to treat SCD. There has
also been much effort directed toward a
cure. From these discoveries, therapies
have emerged that target cell adhesion,
inflammation and hemolysis, as well as
innovations in curative approaches.
CELL ADHESION AND INFLAMMATION
The process of vaso-occlusion begins
with the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes
and neutrophils to activated endothe￾lium (18,19). Aggregates of blood cells,
including platelets, form on these ad￾hered cells and occlude the microvascu￾lature, ultimately causing acute and
chronic tissue ischemia and injury. Inte￾gral to these cellular interactions are in￾flammatory mediators, which activate
endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets
and attract additional leukocytes to the
site of occlusion (20). After the resolution
of the microvascular occlusion, ischemia￾reperfusion injury may further amplify
inflammation, creating a vicious cycle
that sustains and propagates vaso-
 occlusion (21,22). New therapeutic tar￾gets have emerged as understanding of
vaso-occlusion has progressed beyond
the simple concept of a “log jam” of sick￾led erythrocytes in small vessels. Inter￾ruption of the process of vaso-occlusion
downstream from erythrocyte sickling
may either dampen the severity of an on￾going VOC or prevent one altogether, de￾pending on the approach and efficacy of
therapy.
Adhesion: Selectin-Based Therapies
Several lines of evidence suggest that
the selectin family of adhesion receptors
may be a target for VOC therapies. Se￾lectins are expressed on endothelial cells,
platelets and leukocytes, as well as other
cell types (23). P-selectin and E-selectin
mediate rolling and tethering of blood
cells to the endothelium, which may ini￾tiate vaso-occlusion in the postcapillary
venules (24). Cellular and animal models
of SCD demonstrate that interruption of
selectin-mediated cellular adhesion de￾creases erythrocyte and leukocyte adhe￾sion to the endothelium and improves
blood flow (25–29). Several therapies that
target selectins, including rivipansel
(GMI-1070) and the anti-P-selectin mono￾clonal antibody SelG1, have been or are
currently being studied in patients with
SCD.
Rivipansel. Rivipansel is a synthetic
pan-selectin inhibitor with effects pre￾dominantly mediated through E-selectin
(25). After a loading dose, rivipansel is
administered intravenously every 12 h,
with the intent to diminish the severity
of an ongoing VOC. A randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase
IIb trial of rivipansel (n = 76) was com￾pleted, although results have not yet
been published. Communications from
the company report that rivipansel de￾creased the duration of hospital stay and
the amount of parenteral opioids used
during VOC compared with placebo (30).
SelG1. SelG1 is a humanized mono￾clonal antibody directed against P-selectin.
Investigators examined the pharmacoki￾netics and safety of monthly doses in a
phase I study of SelG1 designed to pre￾vent VOC. No results have yet been pub￾lished. A phase 2 study is now planned
in which patients will be randomized to
high-dose SelG1, low-dose SelG1 or pla￾cebo and the effect on VOC will be mea￾sured (NCT01895361). 
Inflammation: Invariant NKT (iNKT)
Cell–Based Therapies
Reduction of inflammation constitutes
another strategy to treat VOC. Studies of
corticosteroids provided some of the first
evidence that antiinflammatories may
improve VOC in patients with SCD.
When administered during VOC or ACS
episodes, corticosteroids decreased
length of hospital stay compared with
placebo (31,32). Unfortunately, there was
a high rate of readmission to the hospital
because of rebound vaso-occlusion after
the abrupt cessation of corticosteroids
(31,32). A follow-up trial to evaluate the
benefits of a tapering regimen of corti￾costeroids during ACS episodes was, un￾fortunately, stopped because of poor ac￾crual (33).
iNKT cells. Therapies designed to tar￾get iNKT cells have recently been evalu￾ated. iNKT cells comprise <1% of circu￾lating lymphocytes in humans. Albeit
small in number, iNKT cells possess po￾tent characteristics of adaptive and in￾nate immunity and “jumpstart” larger
inflammatory responses (34). Similar to 
T cells that produce adaptive immune re￾sponses, iNKT cells express a T-cell re￾ceptor (TCR) that requires binding of an
antigen presented on an antigen-present￾ing cell. Unlike T cells, which express a
diverse TCR repertoire that recognizes
different peptides, the iNKT cell receptor
is invariant and recognizes only the pat￾tern of a lipid antigen, akin to innate im￾mune responses. Cytokines secreted
from the antigen-presenting cell, in re￾sponse to toll-like receptor activation,
further enhance iNKT cell activation.
Within hours, activated iNKT cells rap-

idly produce large quantities of cytokines
(interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
interleukin [IL]-2 and IL-4), which may
activate B cells, T cells, NK cells and den￾dritic cells (35). In addition, interferon-γ
stimulates the production of the
chemokines C-X-C motif chemokine 9
precursor (CXCL9), CXCL10 and
CXCL11, potent chemoattractants for
CXC receptor 3 (CXCR3)-expressing lym￾phocytes (36). In a mouse model of SCD,
interruption of iNKT cell activation or
depletion of iNKT cells reduces tissue 
injury (22).
Regadenoson. Administration of an
adenosine A2A receptor agonist is one
strategy used to block iNKT cell activa￾tion in a SCD mouse model (22,37). On
the basis of that preclinical data, a phase
I study of the A2A receptor agonist, re￾gadenoson, was performed in patients
(38). Twenty-seven SCD patients were
administered infusional regadenoson.
The target dose of 1.44 μg/kg/h was
achieved without toxicity. During VOC, 
a 24-h infusion of regadenoson de￾creased the percentage of activated iNKT
cells by a median of 50%. A multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-
 controlled phase IIb trial is currently un￾derway to examine the potential clinical
benefits of regadenoson during VOC
(clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01788631).
NKTT 120. NKTT 120 is a humanized
monoclonal antibody directed against a
unique epitope on the invariant T-cell
 receptor of iNKT cells (39). Preliminary
results of an ongoing phase I study 
(clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01783691) demon￾strate that NKTT 120 is safe in doses up
to 0.01 mg/kg and rapidly depletes
iNKT cells in a dose-dependent fashion
(40). The return of iNKT cells to circula￾tion is also dose-dependent and in￾versely related to the concentration of
iNKT cells. Further studies will be
needed to determine if long-term deple￾tion of iNKT cells with NKTT 120 de￾creases VOC rate and chronic morbidity.
Limitations of selectin- and iNKT
cell–based therapies. Even though riv￾ipansel and regadenoson may improve
outcomes during VOC, they are unlikely
to completely abrogate the associated
risks of VOC, including the risk of death.
Monoclonal antibodies, such as SelG1 or
NKTT 120, offer the potential to prevent
VOC, a much superior approach. Long￾term inhibition of P-selectin or iNKT
cells in patients with SCD may, however,
carry concomitant risks. Both play im￾portant roles in immunity, and their
chronic inhibition may increase suscepti￾bility to infection in an already infection￾prone patient population.
HEMOLYSIS
Recent studies have suggested an ad￾verse impact of red cell hemolysis on
SCD beyond that of anemia. Sickled red
cells have a shortened lifespan of 
10–20 d, and irreversibly sickled cells
may be removed in hours (41). This
rapid clearance of sickle erythrocytes
may be due to engulfment by monocytes
or macrophages, complement deposition
or entrapment in the microvasculature
(42). Rapid hemolysis releases red cell
contents, including hemoglobin, free
heme and arginase, into the circulation
with a myriad of downstream effects
that ultimately affect the pathogenesis of
SCD (43).
Nitric Oxide and Free Heme
Deleterious effects of hemolysis are
mediated in part by a reduction in NO
bioavailability and the actions of free
heme (44–47). When hemoglobin is dis￾gorged into the circulation, heme iron
reacts with and depletes nitric oxide
(NO) to form nitrate (NO3
–
). Intraery￾throcyte arginase is also released and
metabolizes L-arginine, a key substrate
for NO synthesis. The actions of NO, in￾cluding vasodilation, platelet inhibition
and decreased inflammation, oppose
many of the pathogenic mechanisms
that contribute to vaso-occlusion. There￾fore, a disease model emerges whereby
release of cell-free hemoglobin during
hemolysis and depletion of NO may
lead to vasoconstriction and a prothrom￾botic, proinflammatory environment
that promotes vaso-occlusion (48).
Whether cell-free hemoglobin and
arginase are released in amounts suffi￾cient to deplete NO and induce VOC in
most patients is a matter of dispute (49).
Heme groups liberated from cell-free
hemoglobin during hemolysis may also
contribute to the toxicity associated with
hemolysis (45–47). In mouse models of
SCD, free heme has been shown to acti￾vate endothelial cells through toll-like re￾ceptor 4 signaling, inducing a proadhe￾sive endothelial cell phenotype that
promotes the red cell, white cell and
platelet interactions that underlie vaso-oc￾clusion (46,47). These negative effects of
heme can be blocked by inhibition of toll￾like receptor 4 or the administration of the
heme-binding protein hemopexin (46,47).
NO and Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension is the most
notable complication of SCD thought to
be, in part, secondary to hemolysis and
reduced NO bioavailability. In a pro￾spective cohort study of 195 patients
with SCD, 30% had evidence of pul￾monary hypertension, defined as a peak
tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV)
≥2.5 m/s on echocardiogram (50). Indi￾viduals with pulmonary hypertension
had a 10-fold higher risk of death than
those without. The pulmonary hyper￾tension described in this study was
mild compared with the definitions
used for the general population, raising
questions as to whether the pulmonary
hypertension was actually a contribut￾ing cause of death or just a marker of
severe SCD.
More controversy surrounding the
role of pulmonary hypertension arose
when a prospective cohort study of 398
adult patients with SCD, 96 of who un￾derwent right heart catheterization, was
published (51). Although 27% of the co￾hort had TRJV ≥2.5 m/s, only 6% had
evidence of pulmonary hypertension that
was confirmed on right heart catheteri￾zation, defined as a mean pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure >25 mmHg. 
Of those patients with confirmed pul￾monary hypertension, there was mix of
pulmonary arterial hypertension, consis￾tent with an NO depletion model, and

S40 | FIELD AND NATHAN | MOL MED 20 (SUPPLEMENT 1), S37-S42, 2014
ADVANCES IN SICKLE CELL THERAPIES
pulmonary venous hypertension, more
consistent with left-sided heart disease.
A TRJV ≥2.5 m/s had a positive predic￾tive value of only 25% for pulmonary
hypertension, confirmed on right heart
catheterization; however, the positive
predictive value increased to 64% when
a TRJV cutoff of 3.0 m/s was used. The
group with TRJV ≥3.0 m/s was older
and had worse exercise capacity and a
higher brain naturetic peptide level (con￾sistent with symptomatic, physiologi￾cally relevant disease).
Sildenafil for Pulmonary Hypertension
Extending these findings to a therapeu￾tic trial, investigators sought to determine
whether treating pulmonary hyperten￾sion with sildenafil in adults with SCD
would improve exercise capacity (52).
Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 in￾hibitor that increases levels of cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP),
which mediates the vasodilation effects of
NO. Unfortunately, the trial was stopped
because a significantly high percentage of
patients in the group receiving sildenafil
required hospitalization for pain. The
most likely explanation for the increased
rate of pain in the sildenafil group is
cGMP-related effects on pain signaling as
opposed to worsened vaso-occlusion (53).
Limitations of Hemolysis- and
Pulmonary Hypertension–Based
Therapies
The contribution of pulmonary hyper￾tension to morbidity and mortality of
patients with SCD remains an important
concern whether the hypertension is
produced by NO depletion or other
mechanisms such as pulmonary arterial
thrombosis (54,55). There is a growing
concern in the field that even mild pul￾monary hypertension, defined by a
TRJV ≥2.5 m/s, might contribute to SCD
mortality, perhaps because of exacerba￾tions of pulmonary pressures during
acute VOC. Whether treatment of pa￾tients with SCD and pulmonary hyper￾tension reduces morbidity or mortality
remains an open question. In the ab￾sence of definitive data, an American
Thoracic Society consensus group re￾cently recommended treating patients
with TRJV ≥2.5 m/s with aggressive
SCD-based therapy, either hydroxyurea
or chronic transfusions, while reserving
pulmonary hypertension therapies (for
example, endothelin-1 receptor antago￾nists) for those with right heart catheter￾ization–proven pulmonary arterial hy￾pertension (56). The use of chronic
transfusion with its attendant risks for
patients with TRJV ≥2.5 m/s will be dis￾puted in many quarters.
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL
TRANSPLANT/GENE THERAPY
Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation
Hematopoietic stem cell transplanta￾tion (HSCT) offers the potential for a cure
from SCD. Largely as an extension of the
thalassemia experience, HSCT has been
investigated in patients with SCD for the
past 30 years. In 1984, there was an initial
report of a successful HSCT in a child
with SCD who developed acute myeloid
leukemia (57). Thereafter, a larger study
(n = 22) using matched-sibling donors
and high-intensity preparatory chemo￾therapy demonstrated 90% survival and
70% disease-free survival, along with sta￾bilization of end-organ dysfunction (58).
Despite these promising results, high
mortality rates in patients older than 16
years and a paucity of suitable HLA￾identical donors have limited the wide￾spread implementation of HSCT in this
patient population (59). Overcoming
these obstacles to allow more patients
with SCD to undergo HSCT is the focus
of current investigations.
Reduced-intensity HSCT. Recent data
suggest that reduced-intensity regimens
before HSCT decrease toxicity in adults
with SCD. Preparatory therapy elimi￾nates the recipient hematopoietic cells
and creates space in the bone marrow,
allowing for donor engraftment and
hematopoiesis. Reduced-intensity regi￾mens do not completely ablate the bone
marrow, but do make enough space for
donor hematopoiesis, often creating a
state of chimerism between the recipient
and donor. Thus, the patient still pro￾duces sickle erythrocytes, albeit at a
lower percentage of the circulating cells
that may reverse the SCD phenotype.
Using a reduced-intensity regimen, 10
adults with SCD, ages 16–45 years, un￾derwent HSCT from matched-sibling
donors (60). No deaths occurred, and
there was no graft versus host disease,
which has complicated other lower-in￾tensity regimens (61). Stable engraftment
was achieved in 9 of 10 subjects. In these
nine engrafted subjects, the percentage
of sickle hemoglobin was similar to
donors, five of whom had sickle cell
trait. Similar to studies in children, end￾organ disease stabilized and pain symp￾toms improved. Recently, this group
published findings from a larger cohort
of 30 adults with SCD who underwent
an HSCT after reduced-intensity condi￾tioning. Consistent with the prior study,
the regimen was well tolerated with a
high rate of stable engraftment (87%)
and low rate of graft versus host disease
(62). This approach addressed the prob￾lem of toxicity in adults. Identification of
suitable donors remained a problem,
however, since only 20% of patients
screened as part of the original study
had an HLA-identical donor (60).
HSCT with alternative donors. The
use of haploidentical donors has the po￾tential to increase the number of patients
with SCD able to undergo HSCT. Nearly
all patients will have a haploidentical
donor, who is half-matched at HLA anti￾gens (for example, a parent). The down￾side of this approach is a graft failure
rate of nearly 50%. Fourteen patients un￾derwent HSCT from a haploidentical
donor after a low-intensity preparatory
regimen (63). Although six patients re￾jected the graft (43%), there were also
five patients who achieved full donor
chimerism. Those who rejected their
grafts reverted back to SCD phenotype.
There were no deaths.
Based on these data, HSCT is recom￾mended for those children with an HLA￾identical sibling donor. HSCT is not yet
standard for adults with SCD, although a

RETROSPECTIVE

50% chance for a cure with a haploidenti￾cal transplant may be a viable treatment
option in the future, since the risk of
mortality appears to be low.
Gene Therapy
Correction of the β-globin gene may
be the ideal approach to cure SCD in 
the future. In mouse models, strategies
to transplant genetically modified
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), ex￾pressing normal β-globin gene or an
 antisickling globin, have been investi￾gated (64–67). One approach relies on a
lentivirus vector to integrate β-globin or
antisickling globin genes into the ge￾nome of mouse HSCs, which are then
transplanted into irradiated mice (68).
Insertional mutagenesis is a theoretical
and factual concern. If the lentivirus 
disrupts a tumor suppressor gene or ac￾tivates an oncogene, leukemia may re￾sult. Despite these concerns, there are
trials ongoing to evaluate this approach
in patients with β-thalassemia major
(clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01639690) and
SCD (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02186418).
Homologous recombination, a strategy
to edit DNA that may avoid insertional
mutagenesis, is also being studied. This
technique has the potential to change a
βS
-globin (sickle) gene to a normal 
β-globin gene in a site-specific manner.
In mice with SCD, investigators have
used homologous recombination to cor￾rect a β-globin gene in fibroblast- derived
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
(69). Corrected iPS clones are then dif￾ferentiated to HSCs and transplanted
into irradiated mice, reversing the SCD
phenotype. Genetic modification of
human iPS cells could cure patients
with SCD; however, there are many
challenges to overcome before such clin￾ical trials become a reality (70).
CONCLUSION
With several drugs in the investiga￾tional pipeline and new approaches to
gene therapy under development, the
prospect of new therapies for patients
with SCD has never been better. The goal
of any of these therapies is to help pa￾tients with SCD and to ease suffering. To
this end, some of the approaches dis￾cussed are theoretically better than oth￾ers. A guiding principle when consider￾ing the potential benefit of SCD therapies
is: the further upstream the target, the
better. In SCD, a single gene defect
causes red cell sickling, which has wide￾spread downstream effects on nearly
every organ. If the gene is fixed, red cell
sickling does not occur, and all of the
downstream pathologies are prevented.
Approaches that address mechanisms
downstream of the mutation and ery￾throcyte sickling (for example, adhesion,
inflammation and hemolysis) attempt to
minimize the damage, conceding that
some damage from erythrocyte sickling
is probably inevitable. Potentially, the
greatest value from these downstream
therapies is in combination with other
therapies, such as an antisickling ther￾apy. Short of a cure, multiple drugs to
target multiple mechanisms, similar to
chemotherapy regimens in cancer, may
be the optimal approach for SCD.
Finally, health care delivery markedly
influences the potential benefits of new
therapies for patients with SCD. Much of
the care provided for patients with SCD
occurs in the primary care setting, out￾side of specialized centers. Because pri￾mary care physicians have not been
trained to treat patients with SCD, new
treatments may not be prescribed, even if
they are highly effective. Bear in mind
that nearly two decades after the ap￾proval of hydroxyurea, most patients
with SCD are suboptimally treated with
it, or not treated at all. Any of the new
therapies discussed here may be simi￾larly underused, which may be the most
difficult problem of all.
