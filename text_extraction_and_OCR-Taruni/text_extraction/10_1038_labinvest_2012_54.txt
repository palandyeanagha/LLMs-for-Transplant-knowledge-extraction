In mouse models it has been shown that natural killer (NK) cells can attenuate liver fibrosis via killing of activated hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs) in a NKG2D- and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-dependent manner.
However, only little data exist regarding interactions of human NK cells with HSCs and their potential role in hepatitis C
virus (HCV)-associated fibrogenesis. Therefore, purified NK cells from untreated HCV RNA( þ ) patients (n ¼ 33), interferon-a
(IFN-a)-treated patients (n ¼ 17) and healthy controls (n ¼ 18) were coincubated with activated primary HSCs, and were
tested for degranulation (CD107a expression) and secretion of IFN-g and TNF-a, respectively. Induction of HSC apoptosis
was analyzed using an active caspase-3 assay. We found that following coincubation with HSCs a significant increase
in CD107a expression could be observed in both NK cells from HCV( þ ) patients and healthy controls, whereas only
negligible secretion of IFN-g and TNF-a could be detected. More importantly, NK cells from untreated HCV RNA( þ )
patients were significantly more effective in induction of HSC apoptosis (17.8±9.2%) than NK cells from healthy controls
(6.2±2.1%; Po0.0001). Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation of liver fibrosis stage and the ability of NK cells to
induce HSC apoptosis. Induction of HSC apoptosis was contact dependent and could partly be blocked by antibodies
specific for TRAIL, NKG2D and FasL, respectively. It is noteworthy that NK cells from IFN-a-treated HCV( þ ) patients
displayed the highest capability to kill HSCs (27.6±10.5%). Accordingly, pre-stimulation of NK cells with recombinant IFN-a
significantly increased the ability of NK cells to induce cell death in primary HSCs and was dependent on upregulated
expression of TRAIL. Here we demonstrate that NK cells from HCV-infected patients are highly efficient in inducing
apoptosis of activated HSCs. Thus, NK cells may have an important anti-fibrotic role in chronic hepatitis C.

A specific feature of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the
capacity to establish chronic infection leading to progressive
liver cell damage and fibrosis/cirrhosis.1,2 Together with
alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic steatohepatosis HCV￾infection is considered a major cause of chronic liver disease
resulting in liver fibrosis.1,3,4
Both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells have been
shown to contribute to liver fibrogenesis.2 Hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs) are believed to have a key role in the patho￾genesis of liver fibrosis.1,3,4 In healthy livers, HSCs are gen￾erally quiescent but become activated and subsequently
differentiate into myofibroblastic cells that are characterized
by a loss of retinol and increased collagen expression during
progressive liver injury.3–5
As HCV has been shown to replicate non-cytopathically,6
immune responses have been suggested to have a central
role in HCV-associated liver damage. Cytotoxic T lym￾phocytes (CTL) destroy HCV-infected hepatocytes via the
perforin/granzyme pathway and release inflammatory
cytokines such as interferon-g (IFN-g) and TNFa.
1,2 Release
of these soluble effector molecules is important to control
viral infection, but may also destroy uninfected liver cells
and can recruit HCV non-specific lymphocytes into the
liver. These non-specific inflammatory cells can aggravate

CTL-induced tissue damage and ultimately activate
fibrogenesis.
On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that nat￾ural killer (NK) cells, a major component of intra-hepatic
lymphocytes, can mediate anti-fibrotic effects.7–14 In mouse
models it was shown that NK cells can directly kill activated
HSCs via a NKG2D-mediated mechanism, and are able to
induce apoptosis of HSCs.7–14 As activated HSCs are con￾sidered to critically contribute to the establishment of hepatic
fibrosis via excessive production of collagen, killing of HSCs
by immune cells may represent an important anti-fibrotic
effect. Accordingly, in mouse studies dysregulated NK cell
function has been shown to be associated with accelerated
progression of liver fibrosis.8,10,12
However, it remained unclear whether human NK cells
also may have a role in hepatic fibrogenesis and how HCV
infection may affect interactions of NK cells with human
HSCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 56 HCV-infected patients were enrolled into this
study, including 33 treatment-naı¨ve HCV RNA( þ ) patients
with chronic infection, 17 HCV-infected patients under treat￾ment with pegylated IFN-a/ribavirin and 6 HCV RNA()
individuals who had obtained a sustained virological
response under therapy.
Grading and staging of liver biopsies were performed
according to the METAVIR score as part of the routine
diagnostic work-up.
As a control 18 healthy donors with no history of liver
disease were studied. For further information on patients
characteristics see Table 1.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The
study had been approved by the local ethics committee of the
University of Bonn.
Liver Specimens
Liver specimens were obtained from explanted livers of
HCV( þ ) patients (n ¼ 3). Fresh liver samples were washed
twice in fresh medium and shaken gently to avoid blood
contamination. After mechanical disruption, the fragments
were homogenized on a cell strainer (BD Labware). To obtain
intra-hepatic lymphocytes from the resulting cell suspension,
density gradient centrifugation with percoll (PAA) was per￾formed. The lymphocytes were washed and resuspended in
RPMI 1640 medium. Intra-hepatic NK cells were then iso￾lated as described in the part ‘NK cell isolation’.
Primary Human HSCs
Primary activated human HSCs obtained from ScienCell
(San Diego, CA, USA) have been described before.15–17 HSCs
were cultured for 2–4 passages in defined Stellate Cell Med￾ium (SteCM, ScienCell) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum, 5 ml stellate cell growth supplement, 10 U/ml
penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin (all ingredients
obtained from ScienCell) at 37 1C with 5% CO2 and cryo￾preserved until further use.
Two days before HSCs were used in an experiment the cells
were thawed and cultured in SteCM medium. Then the cells
were harvested, washed, checked for viability using Trypan
blue, and then used in the respective experiments. Activated
status of HSCs was verified by immunofluorescence staining
of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA; Figure 1a).
NK Cell Isolation
Circulating NK cells were isolated from total PBMC by
depletion of non-NK cells using ‘EasySep human NK cell
enrichment kit’ following the manufacturer’s protocol
(STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). The
purity of NK cells was 495% as determined by flow
cytometric analysis of cells stained with anti-CD56-APC and
anti-CD3-PerCP. CD3 contamination in purified NK cells
was o1%.
Purified NK cells were cultured in RPMI-medium (PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 1C and 5%
CO2 over night. Purified NK cells were stimulated with
recombinant human IFN-a (100–5000 U/ml; PBL Inter￾feronSource, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as further indicated in the
manuscript.
CFSE Staining of HSCs
To differentiate NK cells and HSCs after coincubation, HSCs
were labeled with CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl
ester; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louise, MO, USA). Sixteen hours
before coincubation, HSCs were removed from cell culture
flask with 0.02% EDTA solution. The cells were washed twice
with 10 ml sterile PBS to remove the medium completely.
Afterwards, 1  106 HSCs were resuspended in 1 ml PBS
with 5 mM CFSE and were incubated for 10 min at RT. The
staining reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml SteCM for
5 min at RT. After washing the cells one more time with
5 ml SteCM, 1.5  104 HSC/well were seeded in a 48-well
plate.
Apoptosis Assay
Cryopreserved HSCs were thawed and cultured in SteCM at
37 1C with 5% CO2 for 2 days.
Isolated NK cells and HSCs were coincubated in SteCM for
6 h at an E:T ratio of 10:1 in a 48-well plate. Then HSCs were
harvested and HSC apoptosis was studied by intracellular
staining of active caspase-3 using an active caspase-3 apop￾tosis kit (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). In brief,
HSCs were washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 ml BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm and incubated for 20 min at 4 1C followed
by additional washing steps with 1 ml BD Perm/Wash. Then
5 ml rabbit anti-active caspase-3-PE antibody (BD Bioscience)
was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 1C. Next, the cells
were washed again with 2 ml BD Perm/Wash. Finally, cells
NK cells from HCV-infected patients

968 Laboratory Investigation | Volume 92 July 2012 | www.laboratoryinvestigation.org

were resuspended in 200 ml CellFIX (BD Bioscience) analyzed
via flowcytometry (BD FACS Calibur).
Alternatively, apoptosis was studied via flowcytometry
by using the APO-BRDU Kit (BD Bioscience) or a cleaved
PARP antibody (eBioscience; following the manufacturers’
recommendations).
Antibodies
For blocking experiments the following antibodies were used:
anti-NKG2D (clone #149810; 5 mg/ml) and anti-FasL (clone
#100419; 5 mg/ml) obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapo￾lis, MN, USA), anti-TRAIL (clone 2E5; 5 mg/ml; Alexis
Biochemicals; San Diego, CA, USA).
Anti-ULBP-1, 2, 3 and anti-MICA/B were acquired from
R&D Systems.
Transwell Experiments
For transwell experiments plates with 0.4 mm pore diameter
(Corning Life Science, Lowell, MA, USA) were used. NK cells
were coincubated with HSCs on the upper chamber of the
transwell. HSCs alone were seeded in the lower chamber.
After 6 h HSCs were harvested from the lower chamber
and analyzed by intracellular staining of active caspase-3 as
described above.
IFN-c and TNF-a Secretion
Isolated NK cells were cocultured with HSCs (E:T ratio 1:1)
in SteCM at 37 1C for 1 h. Then, brefeldin A (5 mg/ml; Sigma￾Aldrich) was added for another 4 h. Next, cells were harvested
and washed using PBS. Finally, cells were stained with anti￾CD56-APC and anti-CD3-PerCP, fixed and permeabilized
using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), followed by in￾tracellular staining with an anti-IFN-g-PE or TNF-a-PE mAb
(R&D Systems, 1:40 dilution) and FACS analysis (BD FACS
Calibur).
CD107a Degranulation Assay
Cytotoxic activity of NK cells was assessed by a CD107a
degranulation assay as described before.18 In brief, purified
NK cells were coincubated with HSCs at an effector:target
(E:T) ratio of 1:1 in 48-well plates in SteCM in the pre￾sence of PE-conjugated CD107a mAb (R&D Systems,1:40
dilution) at 37 1C. After 1 h GolgiStop (0.5 ml/250 ml; BD
Biosciences) was added and the cells were cultured for an
additional 4 h. Then, cells were stained using anti-CD56-
APC and anti-CD3-PerCP, washed, and resuspended in
CellFix (BD Biosciences) followed by flow cytometric
analysis.

Immunohistochemistry
Slices of frozen HCV( þ ) liver specimens were made with a
microtome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Deutschland). The
slices were dried over night, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Antibody
incubation was done in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum,
0.1% BSA in PBS) at 4 1C over night.
Following antibodies were used: anti-a-SMA (1:200, Abcam,
England); anti-active-caspase-3 (1:500, Abcam); anti-mouse
NL637 (1:200) and anti-rabbit NL557 (1:200; both R&D
Systems).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was done by Mann–Whitney U-test or
paired t-test using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad,
USA). Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare HSC
apoptosis induction through different NK cell groups. Paired
t-tests were used in stimulation, blocking and transwell
experiments. P-values r0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Data are shown as mean ±s.d. (standard
deviation).
RESULTS
NK Cells from Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Induce
Apoptosis in Primary Human Hepatic Stellate Cells
Following coincubation with activated primary human
HSCs, NK cells from both healthy individuals and HCV
RNA( þ ) patients showed a significant increase in CD107a
expression (healthy: 1.2±0.5% vs 4.7±1.9%; P ¼ 0.005;
HCV RNA( þ ): 2.8±1.8% vs 5.7±2.2%; Po0.001; Figures
1b and c), indicating activation of NK cells irrespective of
HCV infection. Moreover, NK cell frequency within the
lymphocyte pool did not differ significantly between
HCV(þ ) and HCV() individuals (11.2±5.3 vs 15.4±8.1%;
P ¼ 0.08).

However, using a caspase-3 activation assay we observed
only little cell death of primary human HSCs after coincu￾bation with NK cells from healthy HCV-negative individuals
(6.2±2.1%). In contrast, NK cells from HCV RNA( þ )
patients induced apoptosis in a substantial number of HSCs
(17.8±9.2%, Po0.0001 vs healthy controls; Figures 2a and b).
It is noteworthy that NK cell-induced HSC apoptosis was
dependent on the NK cell/HSC ratio (Figure 2c) and
could also be confirmed when TUNEL assays (Figure 2d)
or detection of cleaved PARP (Figure 2e) was used to
study apoptosis. Interestingly, the ability of NK cells to
induce HSC apoptosis was markedly reduced in HCV￾infected patients who had successfully cleared the virus
following treatment with peg-interferon-a/ribavirin (9.8±2%,
P ¼ 0.046 vs HCV RNA( þ )), suggesting an HCV-associated
effect (Figure 2b).
To show the intrahepatic relevance of our findings, we
analyzed the interaction of intrahepatic HCV( þ ) NK cells
with HSCs, which also resulted in a strong NK cell-induced
HSC apoptosis induction (Figure 3a). In addition, we found
Figure 2 Natural killer (NK) cells from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are highly efficient in inducing hepatic stellate cell (HSC) apoptosis.

colocalization of a-SMA and active caspase-3 in the liver
biopsy specimens from HCV( þ ) patients, indicating that
HSC apoptosis indeed occurs in HCV( þ ) livers (Figure 3b).
NK Cell Activity Against HSCs In Vitro Inversely
Correlates with Fibrosis Stage
The level of HSC apoptosis induced by peripheral NK cells
from HCV-infected patients was not correlated to ALT, AST,
g-GT, gender, HCV genotype or HCV RNA levels (data not
shown). Staging of fibrosis was available in 37 HCV-infected
patients (23 treatment-naı¨ve individuals and 14 patients
under IFN-a therapy), who had distributions of age, sex,
transaminase serum levels and serum HCV RNA loads
identical with the rest of our cohort. NK cell-mediated
apoptosis of primary human HSCs was inversely associated
with stage of liver fibrosis, so that significantly higher
apoptosis induction was found in patients with minimal or
no liver fibrosis as compared to patients with fibrosis stages
Metavir F1 and F2 (P ¼ 0.01) or F3 and F4 (P ¼ 0.03) fibrosis
(Figure 4a). No such associations were found in patients
under therapy (Figure 4b).
NK cell-Induced HSC Apoptosis Is Contact-Dependent
and Involves TRAIL, FasL and NKG2D
To find out, whether the enhanced activity of NK cells from
patients with chronic hepatitis C to induce cell death in
primary HSCs was mediated by soluble factors, we performed
transwell experiments. However, supernatants of HSCs
stimulated NK cells from both treatment-naı¨ve HCV( þ )
individuals (Figure 5a, left panel) and HCV patients under
treatment with IFN-a (Figure 5a, right panel) had little
effect on HSC apoptosis, suggesting a contact-dependent
mechanism.
Accordingly, NK cells secreted only negligible amounts of
IFN-g and TNF-a after coincubation with HSCs, without any
significant differences between NK cells from HCV( þ ) and
HCV() patients (Figure 5b).
Thus, we next characterized HSCs with respect to surface
expression of molecules involved in the induction of apop￾tosis. As is exemplarily shown in Figure 6a we observed
robust expression of TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand)-receptor II (but not TRAIL-R I).
Accordingly, pre-treatment of NK cells with a TRAIL-specific

antibody significantly reduced NK cell-mediated induction of
HSC apoptosis (Figure 6b). It is noteworthy that NK cells
obtained from HCV-infected patients displayed a signifi￾cantly stronger ability to induce apoptosis of HSCs than NK
cells from HCV() controls even after blocking of TRAIL
(Figure 6c).
In addition, we detected a strong expression of Fas on
activated HSCs, suggesting a role for Fas/FasL interactions in
NK cell-mediated HSC apoptosis. In line with this hypoth￾esis, we found that blocking of FasL on NK cells with a
specific antibody significantly reduced induction of HSC
apoptosis (Figure 6d).
Finally, there was a substantial surface expression of the
NKG2D ligands ULBP-1/2 and MICA/B on primary HSCs.
Accordingly, we found that blocking of NK cell/HSC inter￾actions with a NKG2D-specific antibody partly reduced both
NK cell degranulation (Figure 6e) as well as NK cell-induced
HSC apoptosis (Figure 6f).
Thus, these findings suggest that NKG2D, TRAIL as well as
the Fas/FasL system, may be involved in NK cell-mediated
apoptosis of HSCs. However, our finding that combined
blocking of NKG2D together with FasL and TRAIL did not
completely prevented HSC apoptosis (Figure 6g) may indicate
that additional mechanism(s) also may have a role.
Regulation of NK Cell-Mediated Apoptosis of Primary
Human HSCs
IFN-a has been shown to effectively trigger NK cell activ￾ity.19,20 Thus, we studied whether pre-stimulation of NK cells
with IFN-a affects their ability to induce apoptosis in pri￾mary human HSCs. As depicted in Figure 7a, we found that
prior exposure to IFN-a significantly increased the ability of
HCV() NK cells to induce apoptosis in HSCs in a dose￾dependent manner, whereas incubation of HSCs alone with
IFN-a had no effect on HSC cell death (data not shown). In
line with these in vitro findings, we observed that NK cells
derived from patients under treatment with IFN-a were
significantly more effective in inducing apoptosis of primary
human HSCs (27.6±10.5%, P ¼ 0.0029) than the NK cells
from treatment-naı¨ve individuals (Figure 2b).
Further experiments suggested a role for TRAIL in IFN-a￾triggered induction of HSC apoptosis by NK cells, because we
observed a significantly upregulated surface expression of
TRAIL on IFN-a-stimulated NK cells (Figure 7b, left graph)
whereas expression of Fas and NKG2D, respectively, was not
affected (Figure 7b, left graph; data not shown). Accordingly,
we could show that pre-incubation of primary HSCs with
recombinant TRAIL resulted in dose-dependent apoptosis
induction of primary human HSCs (Figure 7c). In contrast,
coincubation with recombinant FasL had only minimal
effects (Figure 7c). A role for TRAIL in IFN-a-triggered NK
cell-induced HSC apoptosis was further confirmed in
blocking experiments, as we found that pre-incubation with a
neutralizing TRAIL antibody significantly reduced induction
of HSC apoptosis (Figure 7d).

DISCUSSION
In murine models of liver fibrosis, NK cells have been shown
to display anti-fibrotic activity by killing of activated HSCs.7–14
However, the potential role of human NK cells in hepatic
fibrogenesis has remained largely unclear.
In the present study we analyzed interactions of human
NK cells with HSCs and studied whether chronic HCV
infection may alter these interactions.
We found that NK cells displayed only little cytotoxic
activity and cytokine secretion following coincubation against
primary HSCs, irrespective of HCV infection. However, NK
cells from HCV RNA( þ ) patients were highly efficient in
inducing HSC apoptosis. This was in sharp contrast to NK
cells from both healthy donors and successfully treated HCV
RNA() patients, indicating that NK cell-mediated induc￾tion of HSC apoptosis is an HCV-associated phenomenon.

However, HCV does not directly activate NK cells,21 sug￾gesting an indirect effect. Recent data by Ahlenstiel et al19
reported that chronic exposure to HCV-induced IFN-a may
critically modulate NK cell function in hepatitis C resulting
in a polarized NK cell phenotype. Consistent with this hy￾pothesis, we found that both in vitro and in vivo stimulation
with IFN-a significantly increased NK cell-mediated induc￾tion of HSC apoptosis. It is noteworthy that IFN-a has been
shown to induce surface expression of TRAIL on NK
cells.19,20 Furthermore, TRAIL-mediated killing of activated
HSCs is considered as a mechanism how NK cell accomplish
their anti-fibrotic activity.13 Accordingly, we found increased
TRAIL expression on IFN-a-treated NK cells and could demon￾strate that recombinant human TRAIL dose-dependently
induced HSC apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, we found that
pre-incubation with anti-TRAIL effectively blocked the
induction of HSC apoptosis by in vitro IFN-a-stimulated NK
cells. In addition, blocking of TRAIL on NK cells from HCV
RNA( þ ) patients at least in part prevented NK cell-induced
cell death of HSCs.
Moreover, we detected a strong expression of Fas on
activated HSCs, suggesting a role for Fas/FasL interac￾tions in NK cell-mediated HSC apoptosis. Accordingly,
we found that pre-incubation of NK cells with anti-FasL
in part (but significantly) blocked the induction of HSC
apoptosis.
Besides TRAIL- and FasL-mediated NK cell activity, killing
of activated HSCs by NK cells has been shown to involve

NK cells from HCV-infected patients

NKG2D- and granzyme-dependent mechanisms as well as
secretion of IFN-g.
9,11,13
However, coincubation of NK cells from both healthy and
HCV-infected individuals did not result in substantial IFN-g
production, suggesting that this pathway may only have a
minor role in the induction of HSC apoptosis.
It is noteworthy that coincubation of NK cells with HSCs
resulted in significant NK cell degranulation. Moreover, our
data suggest a role for NKG2D, as we found that blocking of
this activating NK cell receptor reduced the induction of HSC
apoptosis in both un-stimulated and IFN-a-stimulated NK
cells and reduced NK cell degranulation as well. In addition,
the NKG2D ligands, ULBP-2 and MICA/B, were strongly
expressed on HSCs.
The role of NKG2D in HCV infection is discussed con￾troversially as some authors reported downregulated
expression of this NK cell receptor,22 whereas other studies
found an increased surface expression in hepatitis C.23,24
Upregulated expression of NKG2D would be an intriguing
explanation for our observation of increased NK cell
activity against HSCs. However, in line with our previous
findings,25 we did not observe any significant differences
regarding NKG2D expression between HCV-positive and
healthy individuals. In addition, in vitro treatment of NK
cells with IFN-a did not affect NKG2D expression (data
not shown). Thus, the pathways how NKG2D contributes
to enhanced cytolytic activity of HSCs in hepatitis C
remain unclear.
Interestingly, we found that combined blocking of NKG2D
together with FasL and TRAIL did not completely prevent
HSC apoptosis, indicating that additional not yet identified
mechanism(s) also may have a role.
Finally, we asked for the potential in vivo role of NK cell￾induced HSC apoptosis in chronic hepatitis C. Un￾fortunately, access to liver NK cells is limited. Thus, only a
small number of intra-hepatic NK cells (n ¼ 3) from
HCV( þ ) patients could be studied. It is noteworthy that
analyzing interactions of liver NK cells with HSCs confirmed
our findings of strong NK cell-induced apoptosis induction.
In addition, we found colocalization of a-SMA (marker for
activated HSCs) and active caspase-3 (marker for apoptosis)
in the liver biopsy specimens from HCV-positive patients,
indicating that HSC apoptosis indeed occurs in HCV( þ )
livers. Accordingly, Gonzalez et al26 recently demonstrated
intra-hepatic HSC apoptosis to be inversely correlated with
the stage of fibrosis in chronic HCV. Finally, we observed an
inverse correlation between NK cell-induced HSC apoptosis
and the stage of liver fibrosis, with significantly higher anti￾HSC activity of NK cells in patients without fibrosis than in
patient with F1/F2 and F3/F4 fibrosis, respectively. These
findings resemble data presented by Morishima et al27 who
found that cytolytic activity of NK cells was inversely asso￾ciated with liver fibrosis stage.
In line with data obtained in murine models of liver fi￾brosis, these findings suggest that in chronic HCV infection
the presence of active NK cells may be protective for the liver
disease progression.
At the moment it remains unclear what mechanism(s)
mediate loss of NK cell activity in progressive fibrosis. A
recent study by Muhanna et al12 suggests that upregulation of
inhibitory NK cell receptors may be involved. An alternative
explanation has been provided by Jeong et al.
10 These authors
showed that in contrast to quiescent and early activated
HSCs, respectively, intermediately activated HSCs produce
high levels of TGF-b. It is noteworthy that TGF-b has been
shown to inhibit NK cell activity.8,28,29 Accordingly, Jeong
et al10 nicely showed that resistance of intermediately acti￾vated HSCs to killing by NK cells is likely mediated by
TGF-b. It is noteworthy that replication of HCV has been
shown to induce secretion of TGF-b and to activate HSCs.
Thus, HCV-induced overproduction of TGF-b might result
in impaired NK cell function, which subsequently supports
progression of fibrosis.
Taken together, we show that NK cells from HCV( þ )
patients effectively induce apoptosis of activated HSCs and
that decreased NK cell activity is associated with advanced
fibrosis stages in hepatitis C.
