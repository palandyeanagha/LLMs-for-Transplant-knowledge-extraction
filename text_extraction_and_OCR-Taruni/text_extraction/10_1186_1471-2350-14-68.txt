Abstract
Background: Variants in the desmin gene (DES) are associated with desminopathy; a myofibrillar myopathy mainly
characterized by muscle weakness, conduction block, and dilated cardiomyopathy. To date, only ~50 disease￾associated variants have been described, and the majority of these lead to dominant-negative effects. However, the
complete genotypic spectrum of desminopathy is not well established.
Case presentation: Next-generation sequencing was performed on 51 cardiac disease genes in a proband with
profound skeletal myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and respiratory dysfunction. Our analyses revealed compound
heterozygous DES variants, both of which are predicted to lead to a loss-of-function. Consistent with recessive
inheritance, each variant was identified in an unaffected parent.
Conclusions: This case report serves to broaden the variant spectrum of desminopathies and provides insight into
the molecular mechanisms of desminopathy, supporting distinct dominant-negative and loss-of-function etiologies.

Background
The desmin gene (DES) encodes an intermediate fila￾ment protein important for maintaining cytoskeletal
architecture in skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles [1].
Desminopathies are myofibrillar myopathies mainly
characterized by progressive muscle weakness, conduc￾tion block, dilated cardiomyopathy, and in severe cases,
sudden death. The overwhelming majority of disease￾associated DES variants described thus far are missense
variants inherited in a dominant fashion. These variants
commonly result in a dominant-negative effect on wild￾type proteins, leading to destabilization of desmin inter￾mediate filament networks, accumulation of mutant desmin
aggregates, and ultimately, myofibrillar disorganization and
toxicity [2]. Only ~50 disease associated DES variants have
been reported to date; and thus, the genotypic spectrum of
desminopathy is not well characterized. In particular, the
role of loss-of-function variants is not well understood.
Case presentation
The proband (Figure 1A; III-1, arrow), was the full term
product of a pregnancy complicated by a reportedly
prolonged period in the birth canal. Following vaginal
delivery, she was noted to have a hemorrhage in the
back of the brain which affected swallowing. Initially,
she was also noted to be cyanotic (lips), hypotonic and
lethargic. Though most of these issues resolved, hypo￾tonia continued throughout childhood. Developmentally,
she was essentially on schedule for gross, fine motor
skills, and language; however, in addition to ongoing
hypotonia, motor progress slowed in early childhood,
with toe walking and stair climbing reported as con￾cerns. The patient received Botox injections for tight
heel cords at age 14 and reportedly became non￾ambulatory shortly thereafter.

She was first evaluated clinically at our institution in the
Neuromuscular Program at age 16, at which time she was
alert and engaging with slightly dysarthric speech. She had
mild ptosis and significant limitation of extraocular moti￾lity. There was no upgaze, however, there was some degree
of downgaze, and also restricted lateral gaze. Her pupils
were equal and reactive to light, and funduscopic exami￾nation showed flat discs with healthy optic nerve heads
and no evidence of gross retinopathy. There was weakness
of eye closure, and some degree of lower facial weakness.
Her tongue was normal in volume without fasciculations
and a gag reflex could be elicited.
Muscle strength studies revealed shoulder adduction
was 4+/5, biceps and triceps were 4/5, wrist flexion and
extension were 4+/5, hand grip was 4+/5, hip extension
was 3+/5, hip abduction was 4-/5, hip extension was 2/5,
knee extension was 5/5, tibialis anterior was 4+/5 on the
right and 5-/5 on the left, tibialis posterior was 5/5,
gastrocnemii were 5/5, peroneals were 4+/5, and her re￾flexes were 1-2+/5 and symmetric. In the sitting pos￾ition, there was some degree of right-sided thoracic
scoliosis. She was unable to walk without assistance and
had a tendency to fall. Her finger:nose testing was
normal and there was no evidence of truncal ataxia in
the sitting position.
During her last visit in the Neuromuscular Program at
age 27, she had marked dextroscoliosis, and contractures
on her ankles, elbows, and hands bilaterally. She was
tilted forward to facilitate the use of her wheelchair. She
had very limited mobility in her lower extremities with
dorsiflexion of 2/5 and 1/5 on the left and right foot,
respectively. Her quads were 1/5 bilaterally. She had 3/5
wrist flexion on the right and 2+/5 on the left. She has
no proximal movements in her arms and her shoulder
shrug was 3/5. She has marked wasting of her muscles
and winging of the scapula. She had very limited
extraocular movements horizontally in both directions as
well as in upgaze and downgaze and she had ptosis bila￾terally. Her sensory exam was grossly intact.
The patient was also diagnosed with dilated cardiomy￾opathy at age 16. The cardiomyopathy is currently
stable, but ventricular arrhythmias are increasing. She
required placement of a tracheostomy to assist with
breathing at age 22, and occasionally requires feeding as￾sistance through a G-tube. There continue to be no cog￾nitive concerns.

Diagnostic genetic testing for this patient has included
chromosomal microarray analysis, POLG1 and RRM2B
sequencing, mitochondrial genome sequencing, and con￾genital disorders of glycosylation testing, all of which
were normal. The patient was first seen by the Genetic
clinic at age 26 in an effort to establish an underlying
genetic etiology for her presentation, where sequencing
of 51 cardiomyopathy genes was ordered. The results
from this test are summarized in the Results section.
Notably, the proband’s younger brother (Figure 1A;
III-2), deceased at the time the proband was first evalu￾ated by Genetics, was reported by parents to have had
similar symptoms in infancy and in early childhood and
was also reported to have had “floppy eyelids”. At the
age of 13, this brother had a muscle biopsy of the right
vastuslateralis, which revealed severe chronic myopathy
with marked endomysial fibrosis and enlarged mitochon￾dria with a complex pattern of cristae. He was also noted
to have dilated cardiomyopathy at age 14. He died at 19
years of age, after developing a respiratory infection.
Given the overlapping symptomatology, the parents
elected to decline a muscle biopsy in the proband. The
parents are currently asymptomatic; both are in their
50′s, and report having had normal echocardiograms
within the last 5 years.
Methods
SureSelect oligonucleotide-based target enrichment
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA)
followed by next generation sequencing on the
Illumina HiSeq2000 platform was used to sequence the
coding regions and splice sites of 51 cardiomyopathy
genes (for a list of genes see: http://pcpgm.partners.
org/lmm/tests/cardiomyopathy). Variant calls were
generated using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)
followed by GATK analysis. Sanger sequencing was
used to confirm variants and to perform familial se￾quencing. Variants are reported according to HGVS
nomenclature (www.hgvs.org/mutnomen) using NCBI
Reference Sequence NM_001927.3.
Results
Sequence analysis of 51 cardiomyopathy genes revealed
two heterozygous variants in the DES gene: c.600delG
which is predicted to result in a frameshift and subsequent
premature termination codon (p. Lys201ArgfsX20), and
c.1285C > T which is predicted to result in a premature
termination codon (p. Arg429X) (Figure 1B). Familial
sequencing revealed both variants in DNA obtained
from muscle tissue from the deceased sibling. The
Lys201ArgfsX20 variant was inherited from the father
and the Arg429X variant was present in the mother and
maternal grandmother, all of whom are clinically un￾affected at present (Figure 1A). These data establish the
variants are present in trans (residing on separate chro￾mosomes) in the proband and affected sibling, and sup￾port a recessive mode of inheritance in this family.
The Lys201ArgfsX20 variant in DES has not been
previously reported in the literature or in population
control databases, while the Arg429X variant in DES
has been detected in 1/8600 European American chro￾mosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project
(http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs150974575).
However, this does not conflict with a pathogenic role, as
this individual may be presymptomatic (age and clinical
information is unavailable for this cohort). Both variants
lead to premature termination codons and are predicted
to result in truncated or absent proteins. Based on the
presentation in this family, these variants are likely to be
pathogenic when present in combination, and unlikely to
cause disease in isolation. Although the segregation of
DES variants in this family supports a recessive inheri￾tance, dominant effects with reduced penetrance or a
milder presentation leading to late-onset disease cannot
be ruled out.
Discussion
The majority of desminopathies described to date are
dominant; however, three cases exhibiting a recessive mode
of inheritance have been reported including compound
heterozygosity for two missense variants (p. Ala360Pro and
p. Asn393Ile) in a family with severe, childhood-onset
desminopathy, homozygosity for an in-frame deletion
(p. Arg173_Glu179del) in a family with early-onset
desminopathy and congenital sensory deafness, and re￾cently, compound heterozygosity for loss-of-function
variants (p. Thr76fsX21 and p. Glu108X) in a family
with early-onset proximal muscle fatigue and weakness
[3-5]. The family presented here features an early-onset
desminopathy in siblings compound heterozygous for
Lys201ArgfsX20 and Arg429X DES variants. Together,
these data suggest that recessive desminopathies may
lead to a severe, early-onset form of disease.
Nine predicted loss-of-function DES variants have
been previously reported in the literature [5-11]. It is
often assumed that loss-of-function variants lead to
reduced or absent protein production due to nonsense￾mediated decay (NMD) if the termination codon is
introduced at least 50–55 nucleotides upstream of the 3′
end of the penultimate exon [12]. However, there are
clear instances where loss-of-function variants fulfilling
these criteria manage to escape NMD and produce a vi￾able protein [13]. Functional studies indicate that some
disease-associated loss-of-function DES variants result in
impaired intermediate filament formation and aberrant
desmin aggregation, suggesting that these variants do not
result in a complete loss-of-function and instead lead to
mRNAs that escape NMD and are translated in

heterozygous individuals, resulting in a dominant-negative
effect on the wild-type protein [6,7].
The three heterozygous family members of our index
case carry predicted loss-of-function variants yet are
currently unaffected, suggesting that these variants may
lead to genuine loss-of-function, as the presence of trun￾cated protein would be expected to lead to a phenotype
in heterozygous individuals. It is predicted then, that the
affected individuals in this family lack any functional
desmin protein. While we were unable to analyze a
muscle biopsy from our current case for desmin stain￾ing, a recent report of an additional family with recessive
desminopathy caused by loss-of-function DES variants
revealed a complete lack of desmin staining in a muscle
biopsy from an affected individual in that family [5].
Interestingly, homozygous null desmin mice have been
shown to develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated
cardiomyopathy characterized by extensive myocyte cell
death, calcific fibrosis, and multiple ultrastructural defects
[14,15]. Together, these data suggest that desminopathies
may occur via two distinct molecular mechanisms:
dominant-negative effects exerted by mutant desmin pro￾teins and complete loss of the desmin protein. These
mechanisms are expected to result in disorganization
(in the case of dominant-negative effects) or absence
(in the case off loss-of-function effects) of the desmin
intermediate filament network and subsequent myofi￾brillar disorganization.
Conclusions
We present compound heterozygous, predicted loss￾of-function DES variants in two siblings with desminopathy.
This study broadens the variant spectrum of desminopathy
and provides evidence that both dominant-negative and
loss-of-function effects play a role in the molecular patho￾genesis of desminopathy.
