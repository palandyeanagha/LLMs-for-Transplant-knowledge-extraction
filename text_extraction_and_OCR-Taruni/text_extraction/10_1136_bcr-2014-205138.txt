Summary


Rhabdomyoma (RHM) is a benign cardiac tumour usually
associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Most RHMs are
asymptomatic and regress spontaneously during the first years of
life. Haemodynamically significant RHMs are classically treated
with surgical excision. We present a case of a premature infant,
born to a mother having TSC, with a prenatal diagnosis of
pulmonary valve atresia and a large ventricular septal defect.
Multiple cardiac RHMs were also present, including a large tumour
affecting the right ventricular filling. Owing to the prematurity and
low birth weight, the infant was inoperable. In this report, we
describe our approach to pharmacologically reduce the RHM size
using oral everolimus in preparation for a two-ventricle surgical
repair of the structural cardiac defect. We also specifically describe
the dose of everolimus that was used in this case to achieve
therapeutic serum levels, which was seven times lower than the
conventional dose applicable for older infants.
