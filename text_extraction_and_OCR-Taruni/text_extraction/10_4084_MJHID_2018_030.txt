Abstract. Background: Intestinal colonization by MDR/XDR gram-negative bacteria leads to an 
increased risk of subsequent bloodstream infections (BSI) in patients receiving chemotherapy as 
a treatment for hematologic malignancies.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral colistin in eradicating 
the intestinal carriage of MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria in patients with hematological 
malignancies.
Methods: In a tertiary hematology center, adult patients with intestinal colonization by
MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria were included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
during a period from November 2016 to October 2017. Patients were treated with oral colistin 
for 14 days or observed with the primary outcome set as decolonization on day 21 post￾treatment. Secondary outcomes included treatment safety and changes in MICs of isolated 
microorganisms. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02966457.
Results: Short-time positive effect (61.3% vs 32.3%; OR 3.32; 95% CI 1.17–9.44; p=0.0241) was 
demonstrated on the day 14 of colistin treatment, without any statistical difference on day 21 
post-treatment. The incidence of BSI in decolonization group was lower in the first 30 days after 
the intervention (3.2% vs. 12.9%), but overall in the 90-day observation period, it did not show 
any advantages comparing to control group (log-rank test; p=0.4721). No serious adverse effects 
or increase in resistance to colistin was observed.
Conclusions: This study suggests that in hematological patients the strategy of selective intestinal 
decolonization by colistin may be beneficial to decrease the rate of MDR/XDR Gram-negative 
intestinal colonization and the risk of BSI in the short-term period, having no long-term 
sustainable effects.

Introduction. MDR/XDR (multidrug￾resistant/extensively drug-resistant) gram-negative 
bacteria have emerged as the most dangerous 
cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in 
hospitalized patients, especially in 
immunocompromised hosts. It was shown earlier, 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2018; 10; e2018030 Pag. 2 / 8
that intestinal colonization with extended￾spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing or 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae spp., 
carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and P. 
aeruginosa might be a prolonged condition in 
certain populations of patients.1,2 It is especially 
dangerous in patients with hematological 
malignancies and HSCT, during the 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, when mucosal 
colonization by MDR/XDR pathogens is 
considered as a risk factor for subsequent 
infectious complication.3–6
It was also 
demonstrated previously, that the inadequacy of 
empirical antibacterial therapy and the isolation of 
carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii or P. 
aeruginosa were among the most significant risk 
factors for mortality in adult patients with BSI in 
the pre-engraftment period after hematopoietic 
stem cells transplantation (HSCT).7
There were numerous studies published on 
decolonization strategies in patients with different 
primary conditions,8–12 but due to the broad 
preventive use of antibiotics and profound 
neutropenia, the problem of choice of strategy of 
intestinal decolonization of MDR/XDR Gram￾negative bacteria is primarily important in 
hematology. Earlier decolonization regimens have 
been studied for Staphylococcus aureus, but there 
is a noticeable lack of data on the regimens to 
decolonize Gram-negative carriage nowadays.13,14
To the investigator's knowledge, no randomized 
clinical trial has been performed to study the 
efficacy and safety of selective intestinal 
decolonization by Colistimethate sodium (colistin) 
in high-risk adult patients with hematological 
malignancies. It is important to mention that in a 
condition of high incidence of carbapenem￾resistant Gram-negative bacteria colistin remains a 
single therapeutic option in a number of cases. 
Colistin, being a non-absorbable antibiotic may 
have certain importance as a decolonizing agent, 
especially in case of Gram-negative carbapenem￾resistant colonization. Gram-negative We have 
estimated that possible decolonization of 
MDR/XDR gram-negative bacteria in 
hematological patients could be beneficial for the 
patients by reducing the risk of infection and for 
the community by reducing the risk of 
transmission. The aim of the proposed study is to 
assess the efficacy and safety of selective 
intestinal decolonization of MDR/XDR gram￾negative bacteria with oral administration of 
Colistimethate sodium in adult patients with 
hematological malignancies.
Methods.
Trial design and setting. This was a non-blind 
parallel assignment controlled trial with balanced 
(1:1) randomization. The primary purpose of this 
Phase 4 trial was the prevention of BSI caused by 
XDR/MDR Gram-negative bacteria in patients 
with hematological malignancies by decreasing 
the intestinal colonization level through selective 
intestinal decolonization. The trial protocol was 
approved by the local institutional review board 
(IRB) and Ethical Committee (Protocol №11) of 
the Republican center for hematology and bone 
marrow transplantation (Minsk, Belarus) and has 
been registered with the US National Institute of 
Health (NIH) and the National Library of 
Medicine (NLM): A Study of Decolonization in 
Patients with Haematological Malignancies 
(DEHAM); ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT02966457.
Republican center for hematology and bone 
marrow transplantation is a tertiary national 
clinical and research center for adult patients 
situated in Minsk, Republic of Belarus. Clinical 
departments are based in the 9th clinical hospital of 
Minsk, which is one of the largest teaching 
hospitals in Belarus performing more than a 
hundred HSCT every year. This center has 150 
beds including intensive care unit for patients with 
various hematological diseases and patients 
undergoing HSCT, as well as an out-patient clinic. 
Center also includes: microbiology laboratory, 
laboratory of bone marrow separation and 
freezing, laboratory of cellular biotechnology, 
HLA-typing laboratory and clinical diagnostics 
laboratory.
Participants. Participants were enrolled in the 
study during the period from November 2016 to 
October 2017. Patients with hematological 
malignancies aged ≥18 years with a positive rectal 
swab for MDR/XDR Gram-negative 
microorganism and the ability to provide informed 
consent were eligible. MDR/XDR classification of 
Gram-negative bacteria was performed according 
to Magiorakos et al. was used in the study.15
Active screening of patients admitted to 
hospital with hematological malignancies, 
primarily to receive a course of chemotherapy, 
was performed by way of rectal swabs during the 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2018; 10; e2018030 Pag. 3 / 8
study period. Patients with signs or symptoms of 
active bacterial, viral, fungal or protozoal infection 
were excluded from the study. Among other 
exclusion criteria used: pregnant or nursing 
women, use of antibacterial therapy in previous 10 
days; contraindication to the use of the study drug 
(including known hypersensitivity); enrollment in 
another study, or in the present study for a 
previous episode; psychiatric disorder or no ability 
to understand or to follow the protocol directions; 
resistance of the primarily isolated colonizing 
microorganism to polymyxin antibiotics (MIC ≥ 
0.5 mg/L). No standard antibacterial prophylaxis 
was used during the study period in the included 
patients. In all cases measures of contact, 
precautions were established to prevent the spread 
of XDR/MDR microorganisms. Prophylaxis 
against Pneumocystis jirovecii with trimethoprim￾sulfamethoxazole was administered to all patients 
in the study with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
< 100 cells/mm3
. Prophylaxis of infections caused 
by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) was performed 
by acyclovir only in patients with high clinical risk 
of HSV reactivation. Real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for 
monitoring CMV and EBV DNA levels in high 
risk patients weekly.
Interventions. Patients randomized to the treatment 
arm received selective intestinal decolonization 
with colistin in a dose of 2 mln I.U. 4 times per 
day PO for 14 days. Patients in the control group 
were observed during the study period without any 
interventions while they received their standard 
treatment for hematological malignancies (“watch 
and wait” strategy).
Outcomes. Patients were assessed at baseline, on 
the last day of treatment (day 14) and on day 21 
after the end of treatment. At each visit, rectal 
swabs were performed by inserting the swab 
immediately in culture media. The pre-defined 
primary outcome of the study was the detection of 
intestinal MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria 
carriage by a rectal swab during day 21 post￾treatment (rate of eradication of MDR/XDR 
Gram-negative bacteria at day 21 post-treatment). 
Safety of the study regimen (incidence and 
intensity of possible adverse effects) and change in 
colistin MICs between baseline and the final visit 
were taken as secondary outcomes. 
Microbiological procedures. Microbial cultures 
were isolated and grown on different 
manufactured culture media. Identification and 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed 
using a bioMerieux VITEK 2 automatic system 
and commercial panels, and the ESBL-phenotype 
was determined using a VITEK 2 ESBL Test 
System. Additional antimicrobial susceptibility in 
carbapenem-resistant isolates (resistance to 
imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) was 
confirmed by E-tests and disc-diffusion assays. 
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
breakpoints used for susceptibility testing were 
based on current EUCAST guidelines,16 with 
commercially available Mueller–Hinton agar and 
antimicrobial discs used in disc-diffusion method 
(bioMerieux).
According to previously published studies, 
colistin resistance of Gram-negative bacteria may 
be underestimated by Phoenix100/Vitek2 systems, 
potentially leading to inappropriate colistin 
administration. It is also recommended to retest 
the isolates with MIC to colistin at susceptibility 
breakpoint (2 mg/L).17 Keeping these arguments in 
mind, we have decided to estimate as a susceptible 
to colistin only isolates with MIC < 0.5 mg/l. 
Sample size and power calculation. Based on our 
clinical experience, we assumed that 25% of 
patients would clear the MDR/XDR Gram￾negative intestinal colonization spontaneously 
within the period of study and hypothesized, that a 
decolonization regimen would be clinically 
effective if able to clear colonization in a 60% of 
patients. Using a two-sided Alpha of 0.05 and a 
power of the study of 80%, with an enrollment 
ratio of 1 and a dichotomous endpoint, we 
calculated a minimal sample size of 60 patients. 
Randomization. Randomization was performed by 
computerized randomization program (ALEA) in 
the proof assistant Coq v. 8.3., which is validated 
for use in randomized clinical trials. The block 
size randomly varies between 4, 6 and 8.
Blinding. Due to the decision of IRB and Ethical 
Committee, blinding in the planned study was not 
considered appropriate from the ethical positions, 
so the study protocol did not include it.
Statistical methods. Based on the study design, the 
intention-to-treat analysis was performed, while 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2018; 10; e2018030 Pag. 4 / 8
none of the patients were excluded in the process 
of the trial and the study characteristics were 
analyzed according to the randomization scheme. 
Due to the ongoing chemotherapy treatment for a 
primary hematological disease, there were no 
cases of data missing or exclusion of the patients 
in the process of the trial due to loss to follow-up. 
All of the patients in the study were included in 
the monitoring of adverse effects of the 
decolonization regimen. The distribution of the 
variables was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk 
test. Differences in MDR/XDR Gram-negatives 
carriage between the study groups were analyzed 
by methods of non-parametric statistics for 
categorical variables (Chi-squared or Fisher’s 
exact tests). Univariate logistic regression was 
used to determine the odds ratio for the presence 
of MDR/XDR Gram-negative intestinal 
colonization in the treatment and control group. 
The probability of development of BSI after the 
decolonization was estimated using the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared with log-rank test. 
Day count in Kaplan-Meier probability test started 
from day 21 post-treatment and included 90 days 
of observation. Data processing and analysis were 
performed using MedCalc Statistical Software v. 
18 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium) 
and SPSS v. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA), 
and results were regarded statistically significant 
when p<0.05. 
Results. 
Participant flow and recruitment. The study 
flowchart according to CONSORT Statement18 is 
shown in Figure 1.
Therefore, among the main causes of exclusion 
from the study before a randomization procedure 
were: absence of MDR/XDR Gram-negative 
intestinal colonization on baseline screening and 
the use of antibacterial therapy in previous ten 
days. After the baseline assessment, there were 62 
patients included in the parallel allocated groups in 
a balance of 1:1.
Baseline data. After the randomization procedure, 
two study groups were showing similar baseline 
clinical and demographic characteristics (Table 1).
The median age of all of the participants in the 
study was 49 years (interquartile interval 36-63
years); 31/62 (50%) were female. More patients in 
the control group were colonized by MDR/XDR 
E. coli (8/31 versus 4/31), while the 
decolonization group had more patients with
MDR/XDR K. pneumoniae colonization at 
baseline (16/31 vs. 13/31). Overall, K. pneumoniae
was the most frequent intestinal colonizer in adult

hematological patients in the study, detected in 
29/62 (46.8%) patients. All of the selected 
microorganisms at baseline showed susceptibility 
to colistin (with MIC<0.5 mg/l). Among the 
patients included, in the absence of chemotherapy, 
recovery of the peripheral neutrophil count over 
500 cells/mm3
estimated on the last day of 
decolonization regimen (day 14) was observed in 
12 (38.7%) in decolonization group and in 15 
(48.4%) in a control group.
Outcomes and estimation. In the primary outcome 
analysis, 19 of 31 patients (61.3%) in the treatment 
group and 10 of 31 (32.3%) in the control group 
have shown negative rectal swab for MDR/XDR 
Gram-negative bacteria on the last day of oral 
decolonization regimen (day 14). Although, later 
on day 21 post-treatment the numbers of intestinal 
colonization by the same pathogens remained to 
some extent similar, with 13 of 31 patients 
(41.9%) showing decolonization effect in the 
treatment group and 12 of 31 (38.7%) – in the 
control group. The observed changes may indicate 
that this procedure of selective oral decolonization 
by colistin had only a short-time effect, with no 
long-lasting microbiological benefits.
Based on the results of univariate statistical 
analysis using Chi-squared test and logistic 
regression, there was a favourable microbiological 
effect of oral decolonization by colistin on 
intestinal MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria in 
the conducted study (OR 3.32; 95% CI 1.17–9.44; 
p=0.0241) on the last day of treatment (day 14). 
Although, on day 21 post-treatment there was 
already no statistical significance shown in the 
treatment and control groups (OR 1.14; 95% CI 
0.41–3.16; p=0.7958). As an additional 
characteristic of the efficacy of oral decolonization 
of MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria in patients 
with hematological malignancies, the number 
needed to treat (NNT) was analyzed for the last 
day of treatment (NNT 3.44; 95% CI 1.89–18.99; 
p=0.0241), showing the short-time effect of 
treatment. Figure 2 displays the evolution of 
MDR/XDR carriage over time in the colistin oral 
decolonization group and observation control and 
shows the short-time effect of decolonization in 
the study.

Estimation of risk for development of bloodstream 
infection. Additionally, to get an understanding of 
the possible clinical effect of decolonization in 
MDR/XDR colonized hematological patients the 
incidence of bloodstream infections (BSI) was 
monitored for 90 days in both decolonized and 
control groups. All of the patients included in the 
study were continuing to receive chemotherapy 
and have follow-up visits for their primary 
hematological disease while being monitored 
clinically and microbiologically for possible 
infectious complications. Totally, there were 5/31 
(16.13%) cases of BSI observed in decolonization 
group and 7/31 (22.58%) cases in the control 
group. Due to adequately prescribed empiric 
antibiotic treatment, no adverse clinical outcomes 
in the study groups was reported up-to-date. The 
incidence of BSI in decolonization group was 
lower in the first 30 days after the intervention 
compared to control group (3.2% vs. 12.9%), but 
overall in the 90-day observation period, it did not 
show any advantages comparing to control group 
(log-rank test; p=0.4721). It is important to add, 
that during the first 14 days after the intervention 
none of the decolonized patients had a 
documented BSI, while during the later period 
BSIs occurred in both groups.
Probability graph for subsequent bloodstream 
infections in patients with intestinal colonization 
by MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria with regard 
to decolonization by oral colistin is shown in 
Figure 3.
Adverse effects. No increase in resistance to 
colistin above MIC of 0.5 mg/l was observed in
Figure 3. Probability of development of bloodstream infection in 
patients with intestinal colonization by MDR/XDR Gram-negative 
bacteria with regard to decolonization by oral colistin in the 90-day 
period after the intervention.
any of isolates during the study and follow-up 
period. Among the registered events, there were 
only 6 cases of liquid stool without any systemic 
effects or signs of infection occurring in 4 patients 
in decolonization arm and 2 patients in control arm 
of the study (Fisher's exact test; 12.9% vs. 6.45%; 
P =0 .06713). None of the patients in the study had 
to stop treatment prematurely due to serious 
adverse effects of the treatment. This may be 
explained by low intestinal absorption of colistin, 
leading to potentially minimal numbers of 
systemic effects of the drug. 
Discussion. This randomized, controlled trial of an 
oral colistin decolonization regimen of MDR/XDR 
Gram-negative bacteria in adult patients with 
hematological malignancies demonstrated a 
significant temporary suppression of rectal 
colonization rate on the last day of treatment (day 
14), with no sustained effect at 21 days after the 
treatment. Observation of the incidence of BSI in 
the studied groups during a 90-days period has 
additionally shown the short-time protective effect 
of decolonization on the risk of BSI up to first 30 
days after the treatment. It may be explained in a 
quantitative decrease of MDR/XDR colonizing 
bacteria in the gut, what may have some protective 
effect during chemotherapy-induced mucositis. To 
our knowledge, we report the first randomized, 
controlled trial examining a decolonization 
strategy with colistin for carriers of MDR/XDR 
Gram-negative bacteria in a group of adult patients 
with hematological malignancies, including 
patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

studied earlier in different settings. For example, 
Huttner et al. have shown the temporary 
decolonizing effect of oral colistin on ESBL￾producing Enterobacteriaceae spp. rectal carriage 
in patients with various comorbidities, what may 
correspond with results of our study.9
Additionally, Saidel-Odes et al. have demonstrated 
in the study, that colistin-based regimen could be a 
suitable decolonization therapy for selected 
patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant K. 
pneumoniae, such as transplant recipients or 
immunocompromised patients pending 
chemotherapy.8 Oral gentamicin was also reported 
as a possible decolonizing agent in an HSCT 
setting.12 It is important to mention, that one of the 
most effective directions of research in the studied 
area should be based on investigation of changes 
in intestinal microbiota composition, leading to 
expansion and domination of certain bacteria, with 
a future possibilities to establish the risk factors 
for domination of MDR/XDR microorganisms and 
potential preventive strategies, including 
decolonization regimens.19,20 In future studies it 
may be suggested, that not only rectal swabs 
should be studied in hematological and HSCT 
patients populations, but a pharyngeal carriage and 
skin colonization by MDR/XDR Gram-negatives, 
what may lead to important practical 
recommendations.21
Limitations and generalizability. One of the most 
important limitations of the conducted study is an 
absence of blinding procedure due to ethical 
reasons, especially in high-risk patients with 
hematological malignancies. The other important 
issue is that rectal swabs may be inadequate to 
detect resistant pathogens present in small 
amounts and stool cultures may be an 
inappropriate way to monitor gut colonization.22 In 
some of the cases, we were not able to 
differentiate the exogenous and endogenous 
rebound of colonization, what may have been 
controlled by genotyping techniques. 
Finally, this study was conducted in one clinical 
center, meaning that the external validity of this 
trial may be limited.
Recommendations. Due to the fact, that intestinal 
colonization by MDR/XDR Gram-negatives is an 
independent risk factor for adverse clinical 
outcome in hematological patients with 
neutropenia, even a temporary suppression of 
MDR/XDR Gram-negatives intestinal carriage 
may result in a clinical benefit during the period of 
profound chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. 
Thus, a strategy of early detection and selective 
suppression of highly-resistant microorganisms in 
such patients during prolonged periods of 
immunosuppression could result in a reduction in 
the incidence of subsequent bloodstream 
infections in a short period. A large multicentre 
trial would be needed to test this hypothesis.
Conclusions. We observed a temporary 
suppression of MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria 
carriage during oral antibiotic treatment by colistin 
at the end of decolonization regimen. The study, 
though, did not demonstrate an effect of the used 
decolonization regimen on rectal MDR/XDR 
Gram-negative bacteria carriage 21 days after the 
end of treatment. Therefore, in high risk 
hematological patients with chemotherapy￾induced neutropenia, the strategy of selective 
intestinal decolonization with colistin may be 
beneficial to decrease the short-term probability of 
developing bloodstream infections up to 30 days 
from the end of treatment with low incidence of
