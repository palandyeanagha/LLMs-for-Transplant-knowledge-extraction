Abstract
Background: Polycystin 1 and 2, the protein abnormalities associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD), are also found in airway cilia and smooth muscle cells. There is evidence of increased radiologic bronchiectasis
associated with ADPKD, though the clinical and functional implications of this association are unknown. We hypothesized
an increased prevalence of both radiologic and clinical bronchiectasis is associated with APDKD as compared to non-ADPKD
chronic kidney disease (CKD) controls.
Materials and Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed at our institution involving consecutive ADPKD
and non-ADPKD chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients seen over a 13 year period with both chest CT and PFT. CTs were
independently reviewed by two blinded thoracic radiologists. Manually collected clinical data included symptoms, smoker
status, transplant history, and PFT findings.
Results: Ninety-two ADPKD and 95 non-ADPKD CKD control patients were compared. Increased prevalence of radiologic
bronchiectasis, predominantly mild lower lobe disease, was found in ADPKD patients compared to CKD control (19 vs. 9%,
P = 0.032, OR 2.49 (CI 1.1–5.8)). After adjustment for covariates, ADPKD was associated with increased risk of radiologic
bronchiectasis (OR 2.78 (CI 1.16–7.12)). Symptomatic bronchiectasis occurred in approximately a third of ADPKD patients
with radiologic disease. Smoking was associated with increased radiologic bronchiectasis in ADPKD patients (OR 3.59, CI
1.23–12.1).
Conclusions: Radiological bronchiectasis is increased in patients with ADPKD particularly those with smoking history as
compared to non-ADPKD CKD controls. A third of such patients have symptomatic disease. Bronchiectasis should be
considered in the differential in ADPKD patients with respiratory symptoms and smoking history.

Introduction
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) char￾acteristically manifests with progressive fluid filled renal cysts
leading to end-stage renal disease in approximately 50% of patients
[1,2]. The contributing genetic defects are found in polycystin-1 and
2, two transmembrane regulatory proteins responsible for mecha￾noreception, cell polarization, and orientation [3,4].
Multiple non-pulmonary extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD
have been described [5,6,7]. Interestingly, polycystins are
expressed in the cilia of both human airway epithelial [8] and
airway smooth muscle cells [9]. Consequently, functional abnor￾malities in polycystins may result in radiological bronchiectasis due
to decreased mucociliary clearance or impaired airway injury
repair [8]. The functional and clinical significance of this
radiologic association remains mostly unexplored.
In the current study we investigated the possible association of
radiologic bronchiectasis with abnormal PFT and increased
clinical pulmonary disease in a retrospective review of consecutive
ADPKD patients seen at our institution as case patients compared
to non-ADPKD CKD controls.
Materials and Methods
IRB approval was obtained (Mayo Clinic IRB#: 09-002623)
regarding study of patients giving written consent to have their
stored medical records reviewed for the purposes of research.
Clinical records of consecutive adult ADPKD patients seen at
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, who underwent both high resolution
chest computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function
testing (PFT) between 1998 and 2011, were reviewed. Patients
were excluded if they had a known secondary etiology for clinical
or radiologic bronchiectasis as reviewed in the available record,
specifically cystic fibrosis (CF), prior mechanical airway obstruc￾tion, chest trauma or surgery resulting in focal lung injury,
recurrent or severe pneumonia, or clinical immunodeficiencies

such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) resulting in
proclivity towards recurrent infection. Patients who underwent
transplantation of any organ other than lung (solid and
hematological) were included in the study. Non-ADPKD chronic
kidney disease (CKD) patients who also underwent chest CT and
PFT during the same study period were selected as consecutive
unmatched controls. The most recent chest CT in the record was
used if multiple studies were completed.
Collected demographics were manually obtained from the
primary medical record for both study groups including age,
gender, smoker status (active, former, and non-smoker), pack
years, and transplant history. Laboratory data included stable
GFR and creatinine within one year of the selected study CT.
Clinical pulmonary diagnoses or symptoms of individual study
patients at the time of CT were categorized in the following
manner: Group 0 = None or no longstanding clinical pulmonary
disease, Group 1 = idiopathic clinical bronchiectasis defined as
presenting symptoms of chronic productive cough, dyspnea, and/
or other constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, not
explained by a secondary or underlying pulmonary diagnosis,
Group 2 = All other airways disease (COPD, asthma, bronchial or
small airways disease), and Group 3 = All other parenchymal,
pleural, or pulmonary vascular disease (acute infection, interstitial
lung disease or fibrosis, granulomatous disease, malignant and
non-malignant nodules or masses, pulmonary emboli, vasculitis,
and pleural disease). For patients with multiple pulmonary
diagnoses, idiopathic clinical bronchiectasis (Group 1) was selected
first as a primary categorization if present followed by all other
airways disease (Group 2), then all other parenchymal/pleural/
pulmonary vascular disease (Group 3). Our rationale was to
categorize or capture existing clinical bronchiectasis or airways
disease in the setting of radiologic findings.
CT criteria for radiologic bronchiectasis included one or more
of the following: 1) an enlarged bronchial diameter greater than
that of the accompanying blood vessel (Signet ring sign), 2) failure
of airway tapering at least 2 cm beyond the last branch point, or 3)
visible airway within one centimeter of the lung periphery
[10,11,12]. All selected CT scans were independently reviewed
by two experienced thoracic radiologists (RH & TH) who were
blinded to the presence of ADPKD and CKD with agreement on
presence and severity of radiologic bronchiectasis by consensus.
Pulmonary function testing done within one year of the selected
chest CT was categorized based on standard criteria [13,14,15]
into one of four diagnostic findings: 1) Normal, 2) Obstructive, 3)
Restrictive, or 4) Other (mixed restrictive and obstructive, non￾specific pattern, and isolated low diffusing capacity for carbon
monoxide (DLCO)); interpreted previously in the record by an
experienced non-study pulmonologist. No further revision or
reinterpretation of PFT findings was done by study investigators. If
PFT was not available within one year of the selected scan, the
most recent PFT in the clinical record was reviewed. Selected PFT
measurements, including pre-bronchodilator percent predicted
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital
capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), forced expiratory flow
at 25–75% of the FVC (FEF 25–75), FEV1/FVC ratio, and
diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were also
collected and compared between the two cohorts.
Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Software Version
9.4 (Cary, NC) with Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test applied to
proportional or categorical data, and a Two Sample T-test with 2-
sided P value used for comparison of continuous or mean data.
Chi-square and ANOVA were used to compare proportion and
means among multiple groups. For predictors of a dichotomous
outcome, univariable and multivariable logistic regression was
applied adjusting for a priori selected covariates of age, gender,
GFR, smoker status, and transplant history. Two-tailed P
values,0.05 were considered statistically significant.
No external funding was involved in the hypothesis, study
design, data collection, or analysis, of this work.
Results
Ninety-two consecutive ADPKD patients and 95 consecutive
non-ADPKD CKD patients underwent both chest CT and PFT
and were ultimately included in the study and control groups,
respectively. Comparison baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of the initial screening
cohort fitting radiologic criteria for bronchiectasis, two were
excluded from the ADPKD group secondary to history of prior
severe pneumonia as likely causes of radiologic findings, and one
was excluded from the CKD group due to concomitant cystic
fibrosis diagnosis.
Compared to ADPKD there were more men in the consecu￾tively selected CKD control group (67% vs. 46%, P = 0.003).
Mean FEV1, FVC, and DLCO were statistically lower in the
CKD group compared to ADPKD, though smoking status and
summary PFT findings were not statistically different (P = 0.35 and
P = 0.121, respectively). Frequency of organ transplantation of
both solid and hematological origin was similar (P = 0.123). The
majority of CT scans in both groups was obtained for assessment
of clinical respiratory symptoms or previously established pulmo￾nary disease, with none obtained for incidental findings found
initially on lower lung cuts of abdominal CTs. In those whom
underwent organ transplantation, 25% of reviewed CTs occurred
prior to transplantation. The median time from date of transplant
to CT was 35.4 (range 2121 to 291) months, with no statistical
difference between the two groups (P = 0.62).
Subgroup comparison data for baseline clinical features among
APDKD patients with and without radiologic bronchiectasis is
presented in Table 2. Smoking history was more prevalent in
ADPKD patients with radiological bronchiectasis (74% vs. 44%,
P = 0.04) without difference in other baseline characteristics.
Radiologic changes of bronchiectasis were more frequent in
ADPKD patients (19 (21%) vs. 9 (9%); P = 0.032, OR 2.49 (CI
1.1–5.8)), with no difference in prevalence of clinically symptom￾atic disease (6 (7%) vs. 3 (3%), P = 0.32) (Table 1.) Univariate
logistic regression for selected covariates is presented in Table 3 for
the whole cohort and Table 4 for subgroup analysis of the
ADPKD group. The presence of ADPKD was associated with
radiologic bronchiectasis, even after adjusting for age, gender,
GFR, transplant history, and smoking by multivariate regression
(OR 2.78, CI 1.16–7.12). Smoking history among ADPKD
patients after adjustment for age, gender, GFR, and transplant
history, was associated with increased risk of radiologic bronchi￾ectasis (OR 4.79, CI 1.43–19.58) despite similar rates of smoking
between ADPKD and CKD patients. Smoking was not associated
with increased clinical disease among the two groups (ADPKD 5/
6 (83%) vs. 41/86 (47%), P = 0.09 vs. Control 1/3 (33%) vs. 53/92
(57%), P = 0.40).
Distribution of summary PFT patterns and frequency of clinical
pulmonary diagnoses were similar among ADPKD patients and
controls (Table 5). Statistically lower percent predicted mean
FEV1, FVC, and DLCO were noted in CKD controls (Table 1)
despite increased prevalence of active smokers in ADPKD
patients. Abnormal FEF 25–75 was primarily associated with
concomitant obstructive physiology in those clinically diagnosed
with COPD or emphysema followed by advanced restriction seen
in interstitial lung disease. There were no isolated low FEF 25–75

values with normal FEV1/FVC and TLC to suggest early or small
airways disease. Indications for PFT testing were no different
between those with APDKD and CKD, primarily done for
assessment of acute or chronic respiratory symptoms or those with
known pulmonary disease (63%) followed by perioperative
assessment for surgical clearance or related pulmonary complica￾tions of organ transplantation (37%). There was no difference in
final clinical pulmonary diagnoses.
All ADPKD patients with clinical bronchiectasis (6 patients) had
at least one or more years (range 14–60 months) of symptoms by
the time of their CT assessment. Symptoms included productive
cough, recurrent rhinosinusitis, and intermittent dyspnea. Chronic
rhinosinusitis was seen in two APDKD patients with clinical
bronchiectasis and none without radiologic disease, while occur￾ring in only one patient from the CKD cohort who did not have
radiologic disease. No other etiologies for bronchiectasis were
evident at the time of clinical assessment. All were treated with
various antibiotic and/or inhaler regimens previously or at the
time of reviewed CT.
ADPKD-associated bronchiectasis most commonly represented
mild bilateral lower lobe radiologic disease as opposed to more
focal disease (Table 6) observed in control patients. Cylindrical
bronchiectasis was the predominant radiological pattern in both
groups (Figure 1).
Discussion
Our study confirms previously reported [8,16] increased
prevalence of radiologic bronchiectasis associated with ADPKD
(21% vs. 9%, P = 0.032). We observed similarly mild bilateral
lower lobe disease using only chest CT studies. In the majority of
cases, such radiologic findings were not identified during initial CT
interpretation. Approximately one third of ADPKD patients with
radiologic bronchiectasis (6 of 19, 32%) also had clinical idiopathic
bronchiectasis however there was no difference in PFT pattern or
prevalence of other pulmonary diagnoses. Finally, in ADPKD
patients, smoking was associated with an increased risk of
radiologic bronchiectasis (OR 4.79, CI 1.43–19.58) in our cohort
even after adjustment for a priori covariates.
In the US, prevalence of clinically diagnosed bronchiectasis
increases with age and ranges between 4.2 per 100,000 (age 18–
34) and 271.8 cases per 100,000 individuals (age 75 and older)
[17]. A recent trend analysis based on Medicare ICD-9 claims
data between 2000 and 2007, found bronchiectasis prevalence to
be 8.7% per year (period prevalence of 1,106 cases per 100,000
people) [18]. However, in the absence of universally accepted
clinical and radiologic disease definitions, reliable prevalence
studies are lacking [19,20]. Kwak and colleagues [21] investigated
the prevalence of radiologic bronchiectasis in 1409 Korean adult
patients who underwent CT scanning as part of general health
assessment. They reported radiologic disease in 129 (9.1%) and

more than half were clinically symptomatic (53.7%) [21]. Female
gender, increased age, and history of prior tuberculosis were risk
factors for the presence of radiologic disease in the study. Despite
comprehensive medical evaluation the cause of bronchiectasis
frequently remained unidentified and such cases were subsequent￾ly classified as idiopathic. While we used a non-ADPKD CKD
control cohort in our study, currently available evidence does not
suggest a higher risk of radiological or clinical bronchiectasis in
such patients. We did find a similar rate of radiologic bronchi￾ectasis (9%) in our control patients as compared to the general
population studied by Kwak et al.

Bronchiectasis and ADPKD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93674

Jain et al. recently reviewed the clinical and radiologic features
of ADPKD associated bronchiectasis in 163 transplanted and non￾transplanted patients [16]. They found older age as predictive of
radiologic disease using a modified scoring system with the
majority of presenting radiologic features similarly mild in nature.
Although demographic data was not available in all studied
patients, only older age was again seen as a significant risk factor
for bronchiectasis based on multivariable analysis. There was also
noted increased frequency and severity of radiologic disease
among those with renal transplantation compared to non￾transplanted patients (52.4% vs 31.4%, P = 0.02). In contrast,
our study noted significant correlation of radiologic bronchiectasis
with active and prior smoking history, without difference in age
distribution among our more highly selected cohort using chest
CT and PFT findings. Including both solid (excluding lung
transplant) and hematologic organ transplants in both case and
control cohorts, we noted no difference in frequency of both
radiologic and clinical bronchiectasis.
The spectrum of clinical disease among those with radiologic
bronchiectasis was mild to moderate at most and not statistically
different between the two groups in our study. Although symptoms
were reported on average greater than a year prior to selected
study CT, none had history of significant weight loss, recurrent
fevers, or hemoptysis. Even among those with persistent clinical
symptoms, severity of radiologic disease was not advanced, with
the majority of all patients with radiologic disease presenting as
mild cylindrical bilateral lower lobe disease.
While the overall rate of smoking was similar between ADPKD
and control patients, subgroup analysis revealed that radiologic
bronchiectasis occurred more frequently in ADPKD smokers than
non-smokers. This association is intriguing in the setting of known
airway epithelial injury with exposure to cigarette smoke including
impaired mucociliary clearance, stunned ciliary function, and
decreased ciliary growth [22,23,24,25,26]. Smoking may further
hasten these effects in patients with ADPKD whom perhaps have
intrinsic ciliary dysfunction as compared to CKD controls whom
did not see an association of radiologic bronchiectasis with
smoking history in our study. Further work is needed to confirm
this association while smoking cessation should be generally
encouraged in all patients.
Interestingly we observed statistically lower mean FEV1, FVC,
and DLCO among CKD patients compared to ADPKD despite
comparable smoking status. As CKD patients were consecutively
allocated based on presence of HRCT and PFT without matching,
such findings were unlikely explained by smoking having a
protective effect on PFT findings in ADPKD patients or a much
more severe effect in CKD. Smoking over the entire cohort was
not associated with increased radiologic or clinical bronchiectasis,
but again with subgroup analysis of ADPKD patients, significantly
associated with radiologic disease even after correction for a
priori covariates. Summary PFT findings (normal, obstructive,

restrictive, and other) were not statistically different between
ADPKD and CKD patients, or among ADPKD patients with or
without radiologic or clinical bronchiectasis.
A proposed mechanism for the development of bronchiectasis in
patients with ADPKD may be linked to abnormalities in
polycystin-1 and 2, the gene products of PKD1 and PKD 2
located on chromosomes 16 and 4 respectively. Although
alterations of these genes are responsible along with other genetic
abnormalities for renal cyst formation [1,27,28], expression of
both of these genes have been reported in various cell types
involved in the extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD, including
valvular heart disease, vascular aneurysm, gut diverticula, and
hepatic cysts [1,28]. The presence of functional polycystin-1 in the
motile cilia of human airway epithelial cells [8] and primary cilia
of human airway smooth muscle cells [9] has also been
demonstrated. These particular cells have been implicated in
airway ciliary function and injury repair with decreased function
due to polycystin abnormality, perhaps an underlying mechanism
by which ADPKD patients develop radiologic and clinical
bronchiectasis. The negative impact of cigarette smoke may
possibly hasten these effects. Although suggestive, more directed
studies are needed to confirm this mechanism at a cellular level.
Strengths of our study include the review of ADPKD patients
with both high resolution chest CT (as opposed to abdominal CT
with lower lung cuts) and comprehensive PFT, allowing assess￾ment and comparison of both radiologic and functional charac￾teristics. While our cohort provided a more specific assessment of
ADPKD-associated clinical and radiologic bronchiectasis, exclu￾sion of ADPKD and control patients whom did not undergo CT
and PFT may have underestimated the true prevalence of
radiologic disease, explaining our lower prevalence of radiologic
findings as compared to Driscoll and colleagues [8]. As well, such

selection may bias towards patients with other respiratory
symptoms or pulmonary disease whose presentation may be
difficult to differentiate from clinical bronchiectasis, and may not
represent again a true estimate of less symptomatic bronchiectatic
disease where chest CT and PFT would not have been obtained.
However, our methodology was less likely to have missed ADPKD
patients with more advanced or clinically relevant bronchiectasis,
one of our study objectives. Another possible confounder is the
inclusion of transplanted patients, whose immunosuppression may
have led to increased risk of both radiologic and clinical
bronchiectasis. While immunosuppression may be contributory,
clinical bronchiectasis was infrequent and similar between the two
groups with both groups having similar transplantation rates. As
well, median time from date of transplantation to study CT was
statistically similar making duration of transplantation over time
less likely contributory to increased risk of infection or immuno￾suppression related radiologic or clinical bronchiectasis. Finally,
our study has all the limitations associated with retrospective data
collection and reflects the patient population of a tertiary referral
center. It did allow though for maximal accrual of selected patients
for a meaningful analysis using more strict radiologic and
functional inclusion criteria.
In conclusion, we observed an increased prevalence of
radiologic bronchiectasis among ADPKD patients who underwent
high resolution chest CT. These changes most frequently involved
mild-to-moderate cylindrical bronchiectasis with bilateral lower
lung predominance. There were no differences in summary PFT
abnormalities or frequency of clinical disease. A history of smoking
in patients with APDKD may predispose to the development of
radiologic and clinical bronchiectasis and smoking cessation
should be generally encouraged. Radiologic bronchiectasis may
be regarded as an extra-renal manifestation of ADPKD with
further studies needed to explore this association.
