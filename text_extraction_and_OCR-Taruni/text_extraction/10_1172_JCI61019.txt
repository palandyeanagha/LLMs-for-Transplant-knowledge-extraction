Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplanta￾tion (allo-HCT) that results from donor allogeneic T cell attack on host tissues. Based on previous work impli￾cating immune cell–derived C3a and C5a as regulators of T cell immunity, we examined the effects of locally 
produced C3a and C5a on murine T cell–mediated GvHD. We found that total body irradiation, a condition￾ing regimen required to permit engraftment of allo-HCT, caused upregulation and activation of alternative 
pathway complement components by recipient APCs. Allo-HCT with decay accelerating factor–null (Daf1–/–) 
host BM and Daf1–/– donor lymphocytes led to exacerbated GvHD outcome and resulted in splenic and organ￾infiltrating T cell expansion. T cells deficient in C3a receptor (C3aR) and/or C5a receptor (C5aR) responded 
weakly in allogeneic hosts and exhibited limited ability to induce GvHD. Using a clinically relevant treatment 
strategy, we showed that pharmacological C5aR blockade reduced GvHD morbidity. Our data mechanistically 
link APC-derived complement to T cell–mediated GvHD and support complement inhibition as a therapeutic 
strategy for GvHD in humans.
Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) — a potentially lethal complica￾tion of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), 
which is performed to treat malignancies or nonmalignant condi￾tions — is initiated by cognate interactions between donor T cells 
and host, MHC-disparate, or minor antigen–disparate (mH-dis￾parate) DCs (1–4). Total body irradiation (TBI), a requirement in 
allo-HCT, activates recipient DCs through incompletely deciphered 
mechanisms (4–6) and facilitates alloreactive T cell activation. 
Subsequent costimulatory and TCR-initiated signaling pathways 
orchestrate pathogenic alloresponses (7, 8), but emerging evidence 
indicates that innate mechanisms influence the strength of GvHD￾inducing T cell immunity (9, 10).
Previous work by our laboratories showed that DCs and T cells 
synthesize and secrete complement proteins; that these cells 
express C3a receptor (C3aR), C5a receptor (C5aR), and comple￾ment regulators on their surfaces; and that locally produced C3a 
and C5a influences the strength/phenotype of T cell responses 
(11–13). These findings raise the possibility that C3a and/or C5a 
modulate T cell–induced GvHD and that targeting C3aR/C5aR 
signaling could be therapeutically efficacious.
Results and Discussion
We examined the effect of TBI used for allo-HCT on the synthesis 
of complement components by recipient APCs. Compared with 
nonirradiated controls, DCs and macrophages isolated 3–24 hours 
after TBI produced up to 40-fold more mRNA for C3, C5, factor 
B, and factor D (Figure 1, A and B). Immunoblots performed on 
DC lysates confirmed that TBI upregulated C3 protein (Figure 
1C). Irradiation lowered DC expression of decay accelerating fac￾tor (DAF, also referred to as CD55; Figure 1D), a surface-expressed 
complement regulator that prevents amplification of the comple￾ment cascade at the C3 convertase step (14). The lowered DAF 
expression lifted restraint on activation of the DC-derived comple￾ment proteins; we detected more C5a in serum-free culture super￾natants obtained from DCs of irradiated mice (Figure 1E). To test 
for functional effects, we performed in vitro mixed lymphocyte 
reactions using splenic DCs isolated before and after TBI (Figure 
1, F and G). T cells responded most strongly to allogeneic DCs 
obtained from irradiated mice, but responses were prevented in 
cultures containing C3/C5-deficient DCs. Splenic macrophages 
do not induce allogeneic T cell expansion (15). In vivo T cell allo￾reactivity was also reduced in irradiated BALB/c recipients recon￾stituted with C3/C5-deficient BM, in which C3/C5 deficiency was 
restricted to the host hematopoietic compartment (Supplemental 
Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI61019DS1). Thus, C3/C5 produced by host hema￾topoietic cells controlled allogeneic T cell reactivity upon allo-HCT.
To test for effects on GvHD, we used DAF-deficient (Daf1–/–) 
mice, in which restraint on local C3a/C5a production is lifted 
(13). We transplanted B6 Daf1–/– mice with MHC-disparate Daf1–/–
BALB/c BM plus 2 different doses of Daf1–/– BALB/c splenocytes 
(Figure 2, A–C). We observed worse clinical (Figure 2, A and B) and 
histological GvHD scores in Daf1–/– recipients (large bowel, WT, 
0.25 ± 0.1; Daf1–/–, 2.8 ± 0.2; P < 0.05; n = 4 per group; data not 
shown). Flow cytometry of spleens of Daf1–/– recipients showed 
approximately 5-fold more IFN-γ+ T cells (Figure 2C).
To examine the role of recipient DAF in protecting against 
GvHD, we transplanted WT or Daf1–/– B6 mice with BALB/c BM 
and spleen cells. We found that Daf1–/– recipients had reduced 
survival (Figure 2D) and worsened clinical scores (Supplemen￾tal Figure 2A) versus WT recipients. We also observed enhanced 
proliferation/expansion of naive and in vitro–primed T cells 5 
days after transfer into irradiated Daf1–/– allogeneic hosts (Sup￾Authorship note: Miriam Merad and Peter S. Heeger are co–senior authors.

plemental Figure 3, A and B). Thus, recipient DAF deficiency 
augmented T cell alloreactivity during priming and reactivation. 
Host DAF deficiency also worsened GvHD in a mH-disparate 
combination (C3H.SW→B6; Supplemental Figure 3C).
To distinguish the contribution of host hematopoietic cell–
expressed DAF on GvHD, we generated BM chimeric mice recon￾stituted with congenic Daf1–/– or WT BM to use as recipients. Con￾trol experiments showed equal reconstitution of donor-derived 
hematopoietic cells in blood 14 days posttransplant (WT, 81%; 
Daf1–/–, 84%; P = NS; n = 4 per group), which indicates that DAF 
deficiency did not affect engraftment. At 8 weeks after reconstitu￾tion, chimeric mice were irradiated and injected with BALB/c BM 
and splenocytes. We observed worse GvHD in Daf1–/– BM chime￾ric mice (Figure 2E), which suggests that DAF deficiency on host 
hematopoietic cells was responsible for the increased alloreactivity 
observed in Daf1–/– animals.
To assess the contribution of donor cell DAF in protecting against 
GvHD, we transplanted BALB/c recipients with B6 WT or Daf1–/–
BM/spleen cells. Recipients injected with Daf1–/– cells developed 
exacerbated weight loss and shorter survival (Figure 2F) and con￾tained greater numbers of skin-infiltrating donor T cells (Figure 2G) 
with increased staining for C3d in the skin at sites of cell infiltration 
(Supplemental Figure 2, B and C) 21 days posttransplant. The same 
result was observed with the B6→C3H.SW, mH-disparate combina￾tion (WT, 87% of baseline weight at 21 days posttransplant; Daf1–/–, 
73%; P < 0.05; n = 5 per group; data not shown).
Since irradiation triggered DC complement production (Figure 
1), activation of which is enhanced by DAF deficiency (11, 13, 16), 
we postulated that the increased C3a/C5a would exacerbate GvHD 
in part via C3aR/C5aR signaling on responder T cells. To test this 
hypothesis, we reconstituted irradiated BALB/c mice with B6 BM 
plus WT, C5ar1–/–, C3ar1–/–, or C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/– T cells (Figure 3, A 
and B). The clinical/pathological expression of GvHD was dimin￾ished in BALB/c recipients of B6 C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/– T cells (large 
bowel scores, WT, 6.0 ± 2.2; C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/–, 2.6 ± 1.5; P < 0.05; 
n = 8 per group pooled from 2 experiments). We observed partial 
protection from GvHD in recipients of either C5ar1–/– (Figure 3A) 
or C3ar1–/– T cells (Supplemental Figure 4), indicative of overlap￾ping, but not fully redundant, effects.
To further assess the role of T cell–expressed C3aR/C5aR, we used 
a competition strategy. We reconstituted irradiated BALB/c recipi￾ents with B6 allogeneic BM plus equal numbers of B6 CD45.1+ WT, 
B6 CD45.2+ C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/–, and B6 Thy1.1 Daf1–/– T cells. After 5 
weeks, we compared the expansion/infiltration of each congeneic 
B6 T cell population in the same recipient animal (Figure 3C and 
Supplemental Figure 5). We observed fewer C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/– than 
WT T cells, and more Daf1–/– T cells, in recipient skin and large 
bowel (Figure 3, C and D). Together, these data indicate that T cell 
expression of DAF, C3aR, and C5aR regulate in vivo T cell alloreac￾tivity during GvHD.
To develop a treatment strategy, we examined the effect of C5aR 
blockade on GvHD. Continuous 30-day infusion of a specific 
cyclic-peptide C5aR antagonist (C5aR-A) by osmotic pump (17) 
starting 7 or 14 days posttransplant (after initiation of GvHD￾induced weight loss) improved the clinical manifestations of 
GvHD in BALB/c recipients of B6 cells (Figure 3E). In the mH￾disparate B6→C3H.SW combination, C5aR-A administration 
prevented the exacerbated disease induced by Daf1–/– compared

with WT donor cells (Figure 3F), which indicates that the effects 
of DAF deficiency are dependent in part on C5a. Whether short￾term C5aR blockade prevents late GvHD and/or induces immune 
tolerance requires further study.
Our results indicated that APC-expressed DAF, through con￾trolling local C3a/C5a production, regulated T cell–dependent 
GvHD. We showed that TBI-induced APC activation was depen￾dent on APC-produced C3/C5 (Figure 1), providing a molecular 
explanation for observations by others that irradiation-induced, 
gut-derived LPS modulates APC maturation (18, 19). LPS induc￾es complement production by DCs (20), complement amplifies 
TLR signals (21, 22), and T cells respond weakly to allogeneic, 
LPS-stimulated DCs from C3–/– mice (13, 16, 20). Thus, while gut￾derived LPS may contribute to DC maturation after TBI, our data 
suggest that the effects are dependent upon immune cell–derived 
complement activation. Because previous work showed that radio￾resistant DCs drive GvHD (1, 3, 4) and that host macrophages can 
be protective (15), our findings strongly implicate DCs as the pri￾mary, pathogenic source of complement following TBI.
While serum complement could contribute to the observed 
effects on alloreactive T cells, several of our observations support 
the conclusion that the mechanisms involve immune cell–derived 
complement: (a) DAF deficiency on donor T cells augmented T cell 
expansion, while (b) C3ar1–/–C5ar1–/– T cells expanded minimally 
in the same host, and (c) in vivo T cell alloresponses were modu￾lated by BM cell–derived C3/C5 and DAF. Finally, as we showed 
that C5aR blockade treated murine GvHD (Figure 3), our data 
support the need for studies to assess the efficacy of analogous 
strategies in humans.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6 (B6), C3–/–, and C3.SW mice (all H2b) and C3ar1–/–, B10.D2 
Hc0 (C5-deficient), B10.D2 Hc1 (C5+), and BALB/c mice (all H-2d) were 
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. See Supplemental Methods for 
sources and intercrossing strategies for other congenic and knockout mice.
allo-HCT and GvHD. allo-HCT was performed as described previously (3). 
Survival after allo-HCT was monitored daily, and clinical GvHD scores (23) 
were assessed weekly. See Supplemental Methods for details.
Antibodies and reagents. All antibodies were purchased from BD Bio￾sciences — Pharmingen, with the exception of TCR-β, CD45.1, and 
CD45.2 (ebioscience). CFSE was obtained from Invitrogen. C5aR-A 
[Ac-Phe-cyclo(Orn-Pro-dCha-Trp-Arg)] was synthesized by GenScript 
and delivered by subcutaneous osmotic pump (Alzet) that functions 
for approximately 30 days.
Preparation of single-cell suspensions and flow cytometry. Spleen and skin prep￾arations were incubated in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum 
and collagenase type IV (0.2 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and passed through a 
70-μm strainer. Isolation of gut immune cells was adapted from previously 
published methods (24).
In vitro cell culture assays. 2 × 104 magnetic bead–isolated (Miltenyi), CFSE￾labeled CD4+ T cells were cultured with DCs in 96-well plates. Samples 
were stained for TCR-β and DAPI, collected using FACS Canto II (BD Bio￾sciences), and analyzed using FlowJo.
C5a measurements. 2 × 106 splenic DCs were cultured in 2 ml serum-free 
HL-1 medium, and supernatants were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-0.5, 
NMWL 10 kDa (Millipore Corp.), and tested for C5a by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Immunoblots. Immunoblots for C3 were performed as described previ￾ously (14) using polyclonal goat anti-mouse C3 antibody (MP Biomedi￾cals) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).
