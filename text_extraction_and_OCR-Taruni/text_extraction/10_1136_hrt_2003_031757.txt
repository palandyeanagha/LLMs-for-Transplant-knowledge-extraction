•  transoesophageal echocardiography
Over the last decade, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) has
evolved as an essential ultrasonographic technique for rapid bedside
tomographic evaluation of the cardiovascular system. Imaging from
the confines of the gastro-oesophageal track reduces signal
attenuation and permits the use of higher ultrasound frequencies,
thereby providing an enhanced spatial resolution. Although
interpretation of the structural and haemodynamic information
from TOE needs training, the technique can be readily integrated in
day to day clinical algorithms, particularly those that demand quick
medical decision making. TOE has a wide applicability and its role
currently expands beyond the realm of clinical cardiology. An
increasing number of anaesthetists, surgeons, and intensivists now
use it routinely for monitoring and guiding operative procedures,
interventions, and managing critically ill patients. This article
provides a brief overview of the indications, imaging techniques,
pitfalls, and the emerging trends in the application of TOE.
HISTORY
TOE for recording continuous wave Doppler velocities of cardiac
flow was first described by Side and Gosling in 1971.1
Subsequently, the first transoesophageal M mode echocardiogram


was reported by Frazin and colleagues in 1976,2 while Hisanaga
and colleagues in 1977 illustrated the use of cross sectional real
time imaging using a scanning device that consisted of a rotating
single element in an oil filled balloon mounted at the tip of the
gastroscope.3 The initial acceptance of TOE was offset by the
logistic difficulties of introducing rigid endoscopes. The ensuing
technological developments that facilitated the transition of TOE to
its present clinical status included the introduction of the flexible
endoscope, miniaturisation, and improvements in transducer
designs, serial improvement in scanning capabilities from
monoplane, biplane to multiplane views, and the addition of
spectral and colour Doppler imaging. TOE is currently used in
approximately 5–10% of patients being evaluated in the
cardiovascular ultrasound imaging and haemodynamic laboratory.
