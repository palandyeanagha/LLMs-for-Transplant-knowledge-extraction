Abstract
A 13-year-old boy presented with a rare spontaneous spinal chronic subdural hematoma (SCSDH) with
no associated trauma or medical problems manifesting as back and bilateral lower extremity pain per￾sisting for 10 days. Neurological examination revealed mild weakness and paresthesia in both lower ex￾tremities. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed 1 week after the appearance of symptoms re￾vealed a chronic subdural hematoma at the thoracolumbosacral region. Follow-up MR imaging per￾formed 1 week later showed significant resolution of the hematoma without the need for surgery. The
patient was discharged with only conservative management. This case of spontaneous SCSDH with
rapid spontaneous remission in a child not associated with coagulopathy indicates that aggressive sur￾gical treatment should be delayed as long as possible in pediatric patients because the spinal structure is
still developing.

Introduction
Spinal chronic subdural hematoma (SCSDH) is a
rare disease that can occur in patients who have
suffered minor trauma, coagulopathy, or anticoagu￾lation therapy. Spontaneous SCSDH is even rarer,
and is occasionally associated with chronic in￾tracranial hematoma,1,11,19) superficial hemosidero￾sis of the brain,15) spinal arachnoiditis, or syrin￾gomyelia.18) Nevertheless, the etiology and pathogen￾esis of spontaneous SCSDH remain unclear because
unlike the cerebral subdural space, the spinal sub￾dural space does not contain bridging vessels and is
protected by the vertebral column as well as several
paravertebral muscles.2,12,14,19) Only five cases of
spontaneous SCSDH without specific pathology
have been reported.3,4,6,8,17) We report another case of
spontaneous SCSDH in a child with no associated
trauma or medical problems that resolved spontane￾ously.
Case Report
A 13-year-old boy presented with back and bilateral
lower extremity pain persisting for 10 days. The
patient had no previous history of trauma or bleed￾ing diathesis. The descending pain had become ag￾gravated. Neurological examination revealed motor
strength of grade 4＋ and mild paresthesia in both
lower extremities, paraspinal muscular spasm, and
marked tenderness of the lumbar spinal processes.
Straight leg rising was limited to 15 degrees, but the
deep tendon reflexes remained within the normal
limits, and there were no pathological reflexes. Mag￾netic resonance (MR) imaging, performed at a local
clinic 1 week after the back pain had begun, showed
a longitudinal space-occupying lesion encircling the
cauda equina in the spinal canal from T12 to S1. The
lesion appeared hyperintense on both T1- and T2-
weighted images but without enhancement after in￾fusion of intravenous gadolinium (Fig. 1).
The patient was transferred to the Department of
Neurosurgery at the Anam Hospital of Korea Uni￾versity for further evaluation and management 3
days after the initial MR imaging. Routine laborato￾ry analyses, including complete blood counts and
coagulation screen, were within the normal limits.

Emergency surgery was withheld and follow-up MR
imaging was performed 3 days after admission to
the hospital because of the tolerable neurological
signs. Neuroimaging revealed remarkable resolution
of the hematoma. His symptoms and the neurologi￾cal signs had improved progressively. The small
residual hematoma extended only from L3 down to
L5. However, the lesion remained hyperintense on
both T1- and T2-weighted images (Fig. 2). Extensive
spinal angiography and bilateral internal iliac an￾giography did not reveal any evidence of spinal vas￾cular malformations such as arteriovenous malfor￾mation or dural arteriovenous fistula.
Conservative management was chosen because
his back pain had recovered rapidly with gradual im￾provement in the neurological deficits of the bilater￾al extremities, and the spinal structure was still de￾veloping at this young age. He was discharged in
almost normal neurological condition 4 weeks after
the onset of back pain.
Discussion
Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
pathogenesis of SCSDH. First, initial hemorrhage
in the subarachnoid space is the primary lesion
that eventually dissects into the subdural space,
and the subarachnoid hemorrhage is washed out by
the cerebrospinal flow through the transitional
state,6,7,9,16,17) as supported by observations of the
transitional state of combined subarachnoid hem-

orrhage and subdural hematoma.2,7) Second, spinal
subdural hematoma might be related to the redis￾tribution of blood from the intracranial subdural
space, and expansion may be secondary to chronic
changes,1) supported by a possible association be￾tween SCSDH and intracranial chronic subdural
hematoma.1,11,19)
The mechanism of the spontaneous resolution of
SCSDH is also unknown. The direction of the move￾ment of a hematoma might be reversed, namely from
the subdural to subarachnoid space.13) The liquid
subdural hematoma may reversely penetrate into the
subarachnoid space through the broken arachnoid
membrane prior to healing, and is then washed out
by the cerebrospinal fluid flow. Dissection of sub￾dural hematoma into the subarachnoid space can oc￾cur gradually because of the time interval of clot ly￾sis. However, in our case, the cause of the prompt
spontaneous resolution is still unclear.
MR imaging recognition of the blood products is
the most important sign that distinguishes SCSDH
from other extramedullary spinal lesions. Acute sub￾dural hematoma is isointense with the spinal cord
on T1-weighted imaging and mixed intensity on T2-
weighted imaging, with peripheral hyperintensity
on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging at approxi￾mately 4–7 days after bleeding. In the late chronic
stage, hyperintensity is typically observed on both
T1- and T2-weighted imaging.10,19) Extramedullary
tumor or abscess will usually appear with rim or
uniform enhancement on T1-weighted imaging,
whereas SCSDH shows no contrast enhancement.10)
Axial images are essential for differentiating be￾tween the epidural and subdural locations of the
hematoma.10,19) Spinal epidural hematoma has a
more lentiform shape, and occasionally extends into
the intervertebral foramina. In contrast, spinal sub￾dural hematoma has a crescent shape and traps the
spinal cord or cauda equina. An inverted ``Mercedes
star sign'' may indicate a subdural location in the
lumbar spine.10) These findings were also observed
in our case (Fig. 1).
Only five previous cases of spontaneous SCSDH
without pathology have been reported.3,4,6,8,17) The
lumbar4,8) and thoracolumbar3,6) regions were the
most common sites for the spontaneous SCSDH.
Only one case was a cervical SCSDH.17) All five
patients, including one pediatric patient, underwent
laminectomy to evacuate the SCSDH.4) Nontraumat￾ic acute spinal subdural hematomas in the pediatric
patients are almost always associated with bleeding
disorders and poor outcomes.5) The present
pediatric case of spontaneous SCSDH in a child was
not associated with coagulopathy at the thoracolum￾bosacral region and showed rapid spontaneous
remission.
Emergency surgical decompression is generally
the best treatment in patients presenting with acute
deterioration and severe neurological deficits such
as acute spinal subdural hematoma. Percutaneous
drainage might be an option in patients with stable
deficit, dorsally located hematoma of moderate ex￾tent in the lumbosacral area, and no bleeding diathe￾sis.2) Conservative management might be an option
in patients with mild neurological deficits and
progressive improvement in the early period, as seen
in our case. In particular, aggressive surgical treat￾ment should be delayed as long as possible in
pediatric patients because the spinal structure is still
developing.
