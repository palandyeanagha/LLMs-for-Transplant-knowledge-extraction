How well does B-type natriuretic peptide predict death and cardiac
events in patients with heart failure: systematic review
J A Doust, E Pietrzak, A Dobson, P P Glasziou
Abstract
Objective To assess how well B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
predicts prognosis in patients with heart failure.
Design Systematic review of studies assessing BNP for
prognosis in patients with heart failure or asymptomatic
patients.
Data sources Electronic searches of Medline and Embase from
January 1994 to March 2004 and reference lists of included
studies.
Study selection and data extraction We included all studies
that estimated the relation between BNP measurement and the
risk of death, cardiac death, sudden death, or cardiovascular
event in patients with heart failure or asymptomatic patients,
including initial values and changes in values in response to
treatment. Multivariable models that included both BNP and
left ventricular ejection fraction as predictors were used to
compare the prognostic value of each variable. Two reviewers
independently selected studies and extracted data.
Data synthesis 19 studies used BNP to estimate the relative risk
of death or cardiovascular events in heart failure patients and
five studies in asymptomatic patients. In heart failure patients,
each 100 pg/ml increase was associated with a 35% increase in
the relative risk of death. BNP was used in 35 multivariable
models of prognosis. In nine of the models, it was the only
variable to reach significance—that is, other variables contained
no prognostic information beyond that of BNP. Even allowing
for the scale of the variables, it seems to be a strong indicator of
risk.
Conclusion Although systematic reviews of prognostic studies
have inherent difficulties, including the possibility of publication
bias, the results of the studies in this review show that BNP is a
strong prognostic indicator for both asymptomatic patients and
for patients with heart failure at all stages of disease.
Introduction
The clinical assessment of heart failure is notoriously difficult; it
is difficult to determine which patients have heart failure and,
once the diagnosis is established, to predict which patients are at
risk of death or further cardiovascular events. Many studies have
tried to determine which factors increase mortality and morbid￾ity in patients with heart failure across a variety of clinical
settings. Factors that have been shown to be predictors of
mortality are increasing age, a history of diabetes mellitus or
renal dysfunction, higher functional disability measures such as
New York Heart Association class, lower left ventricular ejection
fraction, lower sodium concentrations, lower body mass index,
lower blood pressure, the presence of ankle oedema, and lower
quality of life scores.1–4 However, none of these is a strong predic￾tor, and so intense interest has emerged in the predictive value of
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
The natriuretic peptides are released by the heart in response
to myocardial tension and increased intravascular volume and
provide accurate tests for the diagnosis of heart failure
compared with echocardiography or expert clinical consensus.5
In most countries, it is not currently standard clinical practice to
measure these peptides to determine prognosis in patients with
heart failure. Our aim in this study was to review systematically
the literature to determine how well BNP or its precursor form,
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), predict
mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, and to
determine if this varied with the clinical setting or severity of
heart failure. We also wanted to compare BNP with other tradi￾tional prognostic indicators, such as left ventricular ejection frac￾tion, New York Heart Association class, serum sodium
concentrations, age, history of diabetes mellitus, peak oxygen
uptake (VO2), or a scoring system used to estimate the risk of
death in patients awaiting heart transplantation, the heart failure
survival score.4
Methods
We searched Medline and Embase from January 1994 to March
2004 for all studies of the prognostic value of BNP in patients
with heart failure, including all stages of heart failure, all clinical
settings, and all lengths of follow-up, with no restriction on the
language of publication. We also included studies that had
estimated the relation between BNP values and prognosis in
“asymptomatic” patients. We excluded all studies conducted in
patients with recent myocardial infarction because of the likely
instability in the relation between BNP concentration and prog￾nosis at this time. We also excluded studies that did not include a
clear clinical end point, such as death, hospital admission, or fur￾ther cardiovascular event. The search strategy included 17 MeSH
or text word terms for the condition “heart failure” and five
MeSH terms for the diagnostic test “natriuretic peptides.” The
full strategy (see bmj.com) retrieved 861 citations. We
subsequently checked the reference lists of primary studies and
review articles identified by the search for further relevant
studies.
Two reviewers (JAD, EP) checked the lists of abstracts and
then the full papers for eligible studies and extracted data inde￾pendently. Where they disagreed on inclusion or exclusion of a

We assessed the quality of the included studies by determin￾ing how patients were selected for the study (in particular,
whether the study was a prospective and consecutive cohort of
patients), if follow-up of patients was complete and sufficiently
long, and if the ascertainment of the end points was blinded and
objective.6 We assessed the representativeness of each of the
included studies by determining the clinical setting, the spectrum
of the patients included in each study, the method for diagnosing
heart failure, and the age of the patients. We also extracted data
on study size and number of outcomes, the method for measur￾ing BNP, the type of statistical model used, and the way in which
BNP was modelled in the studies.
The most common form of analysis for prognostic studies is
the Cox proportional hazards model. Such models measure the
hazard ratio—the relative effect of a predictive factor on an
outcome—by assuming that this relation is constant over time. To
combine the data from as many studies as possible, we assumed
that where the outcome is relatively rare, the relative risk or odds
ratio approximates the hazard ratio. For the outcome of death,
we planned to combine estimates of the hazard ratio, odds ratio,

BNP using the “meta” command of Stata, version 7.0 (Stata Cor￾poration, Texas USA, 2001). This command also tests for the
presence of heterogeneity.
Results
From the 861 citations, we identified 32 studies that assessed if
BNP predicts death or cardiac events in patients with heart fail￾ure or in asymptomatic patients, either via estimating a relative
measure of risk such as a hazard ratio, or by measuring the statis￾tical significance of the BNP in a multivariable model of
prognosis.7–38 We identified 19 studies that assessed the relative
risk of death or cardiac events with rises in BNP in patients with
heart failure and five studies in asymptomatic patients.26–30 Four￾teen studies used BNP or NT-proBNP to predict the relative risk
of death or cardiac death in heart failure patients (six used a con￾tinuous measure of BNP,7–12 six used a dichotomised measure,13–17
and four used a change in BNP over time8 13 19 20). Eleven studies
used BNP or NT-proBNP to predict the risk of a cardiovascular
event, most commonly death or hospital admission (three used a
continuous measure of BNP,12 21 22 five used a dichotomised
measure,13 14 16 16 17 23 and four used a change in BNP over
time13 14 20 25). Tables 1-6 show the results of each of these groups
of studies.
In most studies, the primary outcome of interest was either
death or cardiac death. These are reasonably objective end
points, but it is difficult to assess from the study reports how
completely patients in the studies were followed up and how
completely outcomes were ascertained in each study. Three
studies reported that some patients in the study were lost to
follow-up; the remainder either reported complete follow-up or
the calculations imply complete follow-up. A possibility exists of
the selective reporting of outcomes or the biased reporting of
only models with significant results.
The studies were conducted in various clinical settings and
used various BNP tests. Although BNP and NT-proBNP seem to
have skewed distributions, most of the models included BNP as
either a continuous variable linearly related to the outcome or
used a discrete cut-off point rather than a logarithmic
transformation of the variable.
We combined the results of four of the five studies that
estimated the relative risk of all cause mortality by using a
continuous measure of BNP in a random effects model.7 8 10 11 We
excluded the study by Bettencourt et al because the published
report did not provide results to sufficient accuracy to enable us
to estimate a plausible hazard ratio. Pooling the other four stud￾ies gives an estimate of the relative risk of death per 100 pg/ml
of 35% (95% confidence interval 22% to 49%, heterogeneity
 = 6.3, df = 3, P = 0.096). Including the one study that used a

continuous measure to estimate the relative risk of cardiac
death12 in the pooled estimate (again excluding the study by Bet￾tencourt et al) gives a similar result of 37% (22% to 54%, hetero￾geneity 2 = 10.2, df = 4, P = 0.037).
The studies that used dichotomous measures showed consid￾erable variation in results, possibly because of the differences in
the cut-offs used and because several of the studies estimated the
relative risk of BNP to predict mortality or cardiovascular events
unadjusted for other risk factors. They show, however, a consist￾ently increased risk of either death or cardiovascular events with
raised concetrations of BNP (tables 2 and 5). The pooled
estimate from the studies using a continuous measure was
consistent with the results seen of the largest study using a
dichotomised measure—that is, a study of a subset of patients
(4305 patients) from the valsartan heart failure trial (Val-HeFT)
trial.13 This study showed in patients with BNP concentrations
> 97 pg/ml a hazard ratio of death of 2.10 (1.79 to 2.42).
Patients whose BNP values fail to fall in response to
treatment seem to be at particularly high risk of death or a car￾diovascular event (tables 3 and 6). Models that included both ini￾tial measurements and measurements after treatment showed
that the values after stabilisation on treatment were more signifi￾cant predictors of death and further events than baseline
values.8 13 19 20 24 25
Asymptomatic patients
BNP and NT-proBNP also predict mortality and cardiovascular
events in asymptomatic patients (tables 7 and 8). Again, the stud￾ies used various methods for measuring the relation between
BNP and mortality or cardiovascular events. The two largest
studies used relatively low cut-off points ( ≥ 17.9 pg/ml in the
study by McDonagh et al, or ≥ 20.0 pg/ml in men and ≥ 23.3
pg/ml in women in the study by Wang et al).26 27 We could not
assess from the data in the studies in this review whether the
mortality risk associated with BNP is continuous or there is a
threshold effect, but even using these relatively low cut-off levels
of BNP, the relative risk of death doubled during the follow up
periods of four and five years.
Comparison of BNP with other prognostic markers
Thirty five multivariable models included BNP or NT-proBNP to
predict survival, cardiac death, readmission, or cardiac events;
these included some models that did not estimate the relative
risk or hazard ratio.31–38 In 23 of the 35 multivariable models,
BNP or NT-proBNP had the smallest P value. In nine of the 35
models, BNP or NT-proBNP was the only predictor that reached
significance; other prognostic markers contained no information
beyond that provided by BNP.7 16 19 20 22 23 30 31 37 Many clinical fea￾tures that have been shown to be associated with increased mor￾tality, such as New York Heart Association class, serum creatinine
concentration, lower systolic blood pressure, and higher heart
rate1 no longer reached significance in models that included
BNP. In two models, BNP or NT-proBNP was not a significant
predictor, and in both cases N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic
peptide (N-proANP) reached significance.8 35 N-proANP also
excluded BNP and vice versa in the model developed by Wang et
al26 but did not reach significance in 10 other models that
included BNP.
Assessing the relative strength of prognostic markers on a
continuous scale is difficult because of differences in the scale of
each marker. We therefore estimated standardised hazard ratios
(see bmj.com). Although theoretically this allows a better
comparison between BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction
as predictors, the results were quite inconsistent between studies
(table 9). Another way to compare the predictive value of
prognostic markers in heart failure is to compare the area under
a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each variable,
as this method also removes the scaling of the variable. We found
only one study (n = 142) that estimated the predictive ability of
factors for all cause mortality in advanced heart failure by using

ROC curves.16 The areas under the ROC curve were 0.738 for
NT-proBNP, 0.640 for left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.650 for
peak oxygen uptake (VO2), and 0.654 for the heart failure
survival score, indicating that NT-proBNP has the greatest
predictive value.
The strength of prognostic variables in models may also be
confounded by decisions on treatment. For example, patients
with low left ventricular ejection fractions may be treated more
aggressively by clinicians, thereby diluting some of the prognos￾tic value of left ventricular ejection fraction. However, BNP
remained a significant predictor of prognosis, even in models in
which treatment was included as a variable7 13 27 30 32 36 38 BNP may

monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease
(MONICA) risk factor survey in Glasgow, four year mortality
from all causes was determined for patients with and without left
ventricular dysfunction (defined as left ventricular ejection
fraction ≤ 40% and > 40%) and raised and normal concentra￾tions of BNP (defined as ≥ 17.9 pg/ml and < 17.9 pg/ml).27 The
risk of mortality for the group with raised BNP alone was 7%;
with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions alone, 8%; and
with the two factors combined, 17%, indicating an apparently
additive risk (table 9).
Comparison of BNP with NT-proBNP
BNP was directly compared with NT-proBNP in only one model.
In the multivariable analysis, both log BNP and log NT-proBNP
reached significance in univariate analysis, but only log BNP
remained significant in the multivariable analysis.30
Discussion
BNP was a consistently significant prognostic indicator in
patients diagnosed with heart failure and in asymptomatic
patients in the studies under review. The prognostic information
seems to be at least additive with that of left ventricular ejection
fraction, and BNP should be used to assess prognosis in patients
with heart failure.
Defining heart failure
If BNP predicts prognosis, including in patients not diagnosed
with heart failure, it raises important questions concerning the
way that heart failure is defined and diagnosed. In most recent
trials of treatment and in studies of diagnostic accuracy, the ref￾erence standard for the diagnosis of heart failure has been systo￾lic function as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction. This
is despite the fact that it is recognised that 20-50% of patients
with heart failure have preserved systolic function.39 Currently,
no criteria are agreed for how to categorise patients with “diasto￾lic dysfunction.” BNP is a strong indicator of cardiac risk and may
therefore be a better way of identifying the cohort of patients
who would benefit from treatment. This hypothesis could be
tested by a trial of heart failure treatment in patients with
discordant results for BNP guided diagnosis compared with
standard echocardiographic or clinical diagnosis. This raises fur￾ther questions. It would not be difficult to enrol patients in a trial
of treatment who have a raised BNP measurement but normal
left ventricular function. Is it also possible that patients with a low
left ventricular ejection fraction but a normal BNP do not benefit
from treatment?
Cut-off values for BNP
The question also arises of what should be considered a
“normal” value of BNP. The risk of death and cardiovascular
events seems to rise with even small values of BNP. In the studies
in asymptomatic patients by Wang et al and McDonagh et al,26 27
the relative risk of death and cardiovascular events was doubled
at values well below those currently considered diagnostic for
heart failure, at 80-100 pg/ml.17 At what measurement might the
benefits of treatment be effective and cost effective?
Monitoring heart failure
The fact that patients with a raised BNP value after treatment,
whether in hospital or as outpatients, were at high risk of a
further event also implies that BNP may be useful to monitor
treatment response and guide decisions on further treatment.
Two small trials have proposed that using BNP to guide
treatment results in fewer cardiac events than traditional clinical
assessment,40 41 but these results are preliminary and need
confirmation in larger clinical trials.

Limitations
Despite the abundance of studies, this review has several limita￾tions. In part this is because systematic reviews of prognostic
studies are hampered by the standard of reporting of the origi￾nal studies. Finding all prognostic studies is difficult as they are
not tagged as such in Medline, and finding negative studies—that
is, studies where the variable was considered but did not reach
significance—is particularly difficult. Many of the studies did not
report on features that would ensure objective and unbiased esti￾mates of prognostic indicators. In addition, the true impact on
prognosis may be less than estimated from these studies because
studies that did not show a significant effect have possibly not
been published.
BNP is a powerful prognostic indicator for patients with
heart failure at all stages of disease. Both initial values and values
after starting treatment are important indicators of disease
severity.

What is already known on this topic
Factors shown to be predictors of mortality in heart failure are
increasing age, a history of diabetes mellitus or renal
dysfunction, higher New York Heart Association class, lower
left ventricular ejection fraction, lower sodium concentrations,
lower body mass index, lower blood pressure, the presence of
ankle oedema, and lower quality of life scores
The clinical assessment of prognosis in heart failure is difficult,
however, and none of the above factors are strong predictors
of survival or cardiovascular events
What this study adds
B-type natriuretic peptide is a strong prognostic indicator for
patients with heart failure at all stages of disease and seems to
be a better predictor of survival than many traditional
prognostic indicators, such as New York Heart Association
class, serum creatinine, and possibly left ventricular ejection
fraction
The relative risk of death increases by about 35% for each 100
pg/ml increase in BNP in patients with heart failure patients
Raised BNP values also predict survival in patients not known
to have heart failure, with the risk doubled in patients with a
BNP value > 20 pg/ml
