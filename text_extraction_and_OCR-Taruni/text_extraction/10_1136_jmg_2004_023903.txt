Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic con￾dition associated with an increased risk of developing
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) early in
life and, to a lesser extent, liver disease.1 Significant advances
have been made during the last decades in understanding its
epidemiology and it has been recently suggested that AATD is
one of the commonest inherited disorders not only in
Caucasians but also among other ethnic groups worldwide.2 3
Although AAT is a highly pleomorphic glycoprotein, with
approximately 100 variants having being identified,4 two
major deficient variants, namely Z and S, account for most
cases of AATD, since the vast majority of such individuals
carry the PI*ZZ or PI*SZ genotype, coding for approximately
15% and 25%, respectively, of normal AAT plasma levels. The
establishment of international registries, including large
series of AATD individuals,5 6 has allowed not only better
definition of the epidemiology of AATD, but also more precise
definition of the associated clinical phenotypes.578
Nevertheless, there are at least 30 AAT alleles other than
the PI*Z and the PI*S alleles which are associated with
significantly reduced or absent plasma AAT levels.9 Given the
extreme rarity of such variants, often described in the
literature as single case reports, little is known about their
epidemiology and even less is known about the associated
clinical phenotypes.
The Italian Registry for Severe AATD was established in
1996 as a result of a nationwide screening programme
sponsored by the two major Italian scientific respiratory
societies.10 Although Italy is considered a country with a
medium-low prevalence of AATD (mean PI*Z gene frequency:
0.0013),11 the programme succeeded in identifying a rela￾tively large cohort of AATD individuals. During the develop￾ment of the screening program, we noticed that, in addition
to the groups of AATD individuals carrying the PI*ZZ and
PI*SZ genotypes, there was an unexpectedly large group of
subjects carrying at least one rare AATD allele. We therefore
decided to study this group of subjects, focusing particularly
on characterising their clinical phenotypes.
METHODS
Screening programme
The targeted screening programme, based on dried blood
spots, has already been described in detail.10 Briefly, paper
filters and questionnaires were distributed to respiratory
physicians throughout the country. Recommendations for
AATD screening were the presence of the following: early￾onset COPD, familial clustering of COPD, reduced levels of
a1-globulins on electrophoresis, serum levels of AAT
,80 mg/dl (nephelometry) or ,150 mg/dl (immunodiffu￾sion), or a family history of AATD. Paper filters containing
the blood spots were shipped to the Central Phenotyping
Laboratory in Rome and submitted to isoelectric focusing. In
the case of an abnormal isoelectric focusing pattern, the
referring physician was asked to ship a serum sample and a
frozen whole blood sample. If the abnormal isoelectric
focusing pattern was confirmed, the sample was then
investigated at a molecular level. The subject’s demographic
and clinical data were retrieved from questionnaires filled in
by the referring physicians and shipped together with the
specimens. It was recommended that the diagnosis of COPD
follow international guidelines.12 All subjects gave their
consent to undergo the genetic investigation, which was
approved by the ethical committees of the institutions
involved.
Key points
N Most subjects affected by a1-antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD) carry the PI*ZZ or PI*SZ genotype.
Nevertheless, there are at least 30 AAT alleles other
than PI*Z or PI*S associated with reduced or absent
plasma AAT levels. Little is known about their
epidemiology or associated clinical phenotypes.
N Over 98 months, 2922 subjects enrolled by the Italian
Registry for AATD, which conducts a screening
programme based on dried blood spots, were
screened. A total of 155 subjects with severe AATD
were identified (132 index cases), together with 152
individuals with intermediate AATD (84 cases).
N Among subjects with severe AATD, we recorded an
11% prevalence of deficient genotypes other than the
common PI*ZZ or PI*SZ (15 out of 132 deficient index
subjects identified). Among subjects with intermediate
AATD, we recorded a 15% prevalence of deficient
genotypes other than the common PI*MZ (13 out of the
84 index cases).
N As the cohort of subjects carrying rare AATD variants
was relatively large, we were able investigate their
characteristics in terms of associated clinical pheno￾types, pulmonary lung function, smoking habit, and
geographic distribution. We found that these rare
variants had a special position within the spectrum of
genotype-phenotype correlations in a1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency.
N The prevalence of rare a1-antitrypsin variants found in
Italy is the highest so far recorded worldwide and,
interestingly, occurs in a country with a medium-low
prevalence of the common PI*ZZ genotype.

Detection of AATD variants
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood cells using
the standard technique. The S and Z variants were genotyped
by a commercially available amplification-reverse hybridisa￾tion test kit (Symbiosis, Cocconato, Italy)13 and by PCR-RFLP
using TaqI as the restriction enzyme.14 The genomic DNA
was sequenced after PCR amplification of all coding exons
(II–V).15 All sequencing products were obtained using the ABI
Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
kit (Applied Biosystems, Arrington, UK) and were analysed
in an automatic ABI 377 DNA sequencer.
Statistical analysis
Separate files were created for the different genotypes.
Subjects homozygous or compound heterozygous for defi￾ciency variants were assigned to the severe AATD group,
whereas individuals heterozygous for a deficiency allele and
the normal M allele were assigned to the intermediate AATD
group. Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used to test the normal
distribution for quantitative variables and data values are
presented as mean (SD) values. Comparisons between means
were performed with analysis of variance, using the Scheffe´
test for post-hoc comparison. Associations between geno￾types and disease status were compared with Fisher’s exact
test. To detect associations between FEV1/FVC (forced
expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity), smoke, and
genotype, univariate analyses were carried out using logistic
regression, followed by multivariate analyses; results are
reported as unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A p value ,0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance; all tests were
two-sided. Analyses were performed with STATA, release 7.0
(Stata, College Station, TX, USA) and with STATISTICA for
Windows (StatSoft, Bedford, UK, 2002).
RESULTS
During the 98 months from February 1996 to April 2004,
2922 subjects were screened, thanks to more than 250
physicians throughout the country who shipped at least one
paper filter. A total of 155 individuals (5.3%) with severe
AATD were detected (table 1). Of these, 132 were index cases
(that is, the probands, constituting 4.5% of the subjects
overall), while the other 23 were non-index cases, that is,
subjects identified during family screening. Individuals
homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ) formed the large majority
(114, 74% of the severe AATD; index cases: 96; 73%),
followed by a group of 25 individuals (16%) with the
compound heterozygous PI*SZ genotype (index cases: 21;
16%). The third group with severe AATD included 16
individuals (10%) carrying at least one rare, non-Z and
non-S deficient allele (index cases: 15; 11%). In addition,
there was a cohort of 131 subjects with intermediate AATD
PI*MZ, accounting for 4.5% of all those screened (index
cases: 84; 2.9%) and 21 subjects with intermediate deficiency,
resulting from the combination of a rare allele with the
normal M variant (0.7% of all those screened; index cases: 13;
0.4%). The rare allele frequency detected was 0.077, taking
into account subjects with both severe and intermediate
AATD.
The genotyping details of the 37 individuals carrying at
least one rare AATD variant are given in table 2. In this series
we found 16 individuals carrying the rare variant in a
homozygous fashion or in compound heterozygosity with the
common AATD variant Z (hereinafter referred to as the rare/
deficient (R/D) subset). Twenty one individuals carried the
rare variant in heterozygosity with a normal M variant
(hereinafter referred to as the M/rare (M/R) subset). The
majority of the subjects carried the Mmalton and Mprocida
variants. Four subjects carried the Plowell variant, two subjects
carried the I variant, and one subject each the Mvarallo,
Mheerlen, Q0procida, Q0cairo , and Q0clayton variants.
Demographic details are given in table 3. From now on, we
will present data from index cases only. Comparisons were
performed among individuals homozygous or compound
heterozygous for deficiency alleles (that is, R/D, PI*ZZ, and
PI*SZ) and between individuals heterozygous for a deficiency
allele and a normal allele (M/R and PI*MZ). There were no
differences as far as mean age at diagnosis was concerned.
Male subjects were more frequent in the R/D group than in
the PI*SZ group. Former smokers were significantly more
frequent among R/D individuals than among both PI*ZZ and
PI*SZ subjects (p = 0.021 and p = 0.013, respectively). Whole
cigarette smoke exposure (current+former) was detected in
100% of R/D individuals v 67% of PI*ZZ subjects and 52% of
PI*SZ subjects (p = 0.008 and p = 0.0017, respectively), as
well as in 85% of M/R subjects v 52% of PI*MZ subjects
(p = 0.03). As far as the plasma AAT levels were concerned,
the R/D subset had a lower mean (SD) level of 29 (18) mg/dl,
similar to that of the PI*ZZ group (28 (11) mg/dl), but
significantly lower than that of the PI*SZ group (62 (16) mg/
dl; p,0.0001). The M/R subset had a mean (SD) AAT level of
61 (20) mg/dl, which is significantly lower than that of the
related PI*MZ group (93 (23) mg/dl; p,0.0001).
Tables 4 and 5 present the patients’ phenotypes, that is, the
associated clinical manifestations and lung function data,
retrieved from questionnaires filled in by the referring
physicians.

Among subjects with severe AATD, COPD (alone or in
combination with chronic liver disease) was diagnosed more
frequently in the R/D group (100%), than in the two other
related groups, PI*ZZ (79%), and PI*SZ (38%, p = 0.004). In
seven cases out of 96 PI*ZZ (7%) and in two out of 15 R/D
(13%), COPD and liver disease were diagnosed simulta￾neously. Prevalence of chronic liver disease did not differ
among subjects carrying severe AATD; it was absent in M/R
subjects, but it was detected in 11% of PI*MZ individuals. A
number of other associated conditions were reported: with
the exception of one PI*MZ subject diagnosed with
Wegener’s granulomatosis, which has been repeatedly
associated with AATD,16 the other conditions are most likely
to be chance associations. The percentage of healthy subjects
increased significantly among the two groups with inter￾mediate AATD (42% in the PI*MZ group, and 46% in the M/R
group).
With reference to the functional phenotype (table 5), the
mean basal FEV1 value (% predicted) was significantly lower
in the R/D group as a whole than in the related PI*SZ group
(p = 0.00095), but not significantly lower than in the PI*ZZ
group. The mean FEV1/FVC among the five genotype groups
was consistently different (table 5). However, when indivi￾duals with normal lung function (healthy, liver disease
without COPD, other conditions) were disaggregated from
the whole group, the FEV1 and FEV1/FVC in the remaining
patients with COPD no longer differed among the R/D, PI*ZZ,
and PI*SZ subgroups. The difference between PI*MZ and M/R
subjects for FEV1 was significant, but it may have been
influenced by the low number of M/R subjects with COPD.
The effect of smoking habit and genotype on FEV1/FVC is
summarised in table 6. Logistic regression and multivariate
analysis showed that smoke and PI*ZZ and PI*RD genotypes
act as independent risk factors for an FEV1/FVC,0.70.
DISCUSSION
Our finding of a 11% prevalence of subjects with severe AATD
carrying genotypes other than PI*ZZ and PI*SZ is, to our
knowledge, the highest reported so far. The NHLBI Registry
for severe AATD with 1021 subjects includes 1.7% with
genotypes other than PI*ZZ or PI*SZ.17 The Alpha One
Foundation Research Network Registry also includes subjects
with intermediate AATD: individuals with rare AATD
variants accounted for 5.7% of the total.18 However, in our
series including subjects with both severe and intermediate
AATD increased the prevalence to 13%. Thus, our large series
of rare AATD variants, detected within the relatively small
sized Italian registry, prompted us to investigate the
characteristics of these subjects more closely.
Molecular characterisation showed that the majority of
subjects with rare AATD variants, including both index and
non-index cases, carried at least one Mmalton allele (16/37
individuals, 21/74 alleles). This mutation is raised on the M2
base allele and consists of the deletion of an entire TTC codon
in exon II, and subsequent deletion of the Phe51 or Phe52
residue of the mature protein.19 20 Ten of the 44 subjects
carried at least one Mprocida allele, based on M1(Val213), a
TRC point mutation at codon 41 exon II, leading to a proline
for leucine substitution.21 The I allele, found in two
individuals, and the Plowell allele (also referred to as
QO*Cardiff), found in four individuals, are both raised on
the M1(Val213) base allele.20 The I allele is characterised by a
CRT point mutation at codon 39 exon II, leading to a
cysteine for arginine substitution, whereas the Plowell allele is
characterised by an ART transversion at codon 256 exon III,
leading to a valine for asparagine substitution. The Mheerlen
variant, found in one subject, is raised on the M1(Ala213)
base allele and it is characterised by a CRT point mutation at
codon 369 exon V, leading to a leucine for proline
substitution.22 The Q0procida allele (also referred to as
Nullprocida or Nullisola di procida)23 is a null variant characterised
by a 17 kb deletion encompassing exons II–V. The Q0clayton, a
null variant raised on the M1(Val213) base allele, more
recently identified,24 is characterised by a C insertion in exon
V, causing a 39 frameshift mutation, in turn resulting in a
stop codon at residue 376. Finally, two AATD variants were
recently found in our series of subjects: the Mvarallo allele was
first described in a family from a Northern Italian village.

This allele is characterised by a 30 bp deletion accompanied
by a 22 bp fragment insertion at the 41–51 codon region in
exon II,25 whereas the Q0cairo is a null variant raised on the
M1(Val213) base allele, characterised by a ART transversion
at codon 259, exon II, resulting in a stop codon instead of a
Lys codon (GenBank accession number AY 256958).
In addition to revealing the high prevalence of rare AAT
variants in Italy, which will be discussed later, our relatively
large series prompted us to examine the phenotypic profile of
carriers of such variants. Taken as a whole and looking at
index cases only, there was a higher proportion of men (12/
15) and a higher proportion of current or former smokers
(100%) among carriers of rare variants than in the other
groups with severe AATD (PI*ZZ and PI*SZ) (table 3). Among
subjects with intermediate AATD, M/R subjects smoked more
than the related PI*MZ subjects (table 3). The higher
proportion of former smokers among R/D individuals is
intriguing: perhaps they stopped smoking because of the lung
disease.
Analysis of COPD prevalence and respiratory function data
among the groups revealed interesting findings. We found an
increasing prevalence of COPD according to the hierarchy
PI*MZ (38%) and PI*SZ (38%),M/R(46%),PI*ZZ (79%),R/D
(100%) (table 4). Accordingly, the magnitude of FEV1/FVC
ratio impairment followed the same hierarchy: PI*MZ
(0.74),PI*SZ (0.71),M/R (0.67),PI*ZZ (0.57),R/D
(0.39) (table 5).
Thus, within the spectrum of prevalence of lung disease
associated with AATD, carrying a rare AATD variant(s) places
R/D individuals at the highest risk, in the same position as
PI*ZZ individuals, whereas M/R individuals are in an
intermediate position, with PI*SZ and PI*MZ individuals at
the end with lower risk.8 26 Since it is widely accepted that
phenotypes result from the interaction between genetic
determinants (in this case, the plasma levels of AAT) and
environmental determinants (in this case, cigarette smok￾ing), then the phenotypic ranking seems to result from the
interaction between the AAT plasma levels reported in our
series, with the R/D and PI*ZZ groups at the lowest end (29
and 28 mg/dl, respectively), followed by PI*SZ (62 mg/dl)
and M/R (61 mg/dl), and with PI*MZ individuals at the
highest end (93 mg/dl), and the smoking prevalence, ranking
R/D (100%).M/R (85%).PI*ZZ (67%).PI*SZ (52%) and
PI*MZ (52%). These findings further support the concept that
the genetic risk factor for COPD is significantly related to the
AAT level,1 and that cigarette smoking may influence the risk
rate27 28 (table 6).
Chronic liver disease, which is the second most common
feature associated with AATD, was detected in 13% of R/D
subjects, 13% of PI*ZZ subjects, 19% of PI*SZ subjects, and
11% of PI*MZ subjects (table 4). Diagnosis of chronic liver

disease was based on abnormalities in liver function tests;
15% of subjects identified as affected by chronic liver disease
had a definitive biopsy-proved diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The
Mmalton variant, the most frequently detected rare AATD
variant, is known to be significantly associated, like the
common Z deficiency variant, with hepatic disease, due to
intracellular accumulation of the AAT protein.1 29 In our
series, isolated liver disease was detected in one non-index
subject (Z/Plowell) and in association with COPD in two
index subjects (Mprocida/Mprocida and Z/Mmalton). Interaction
between individual and environmental factors is also likely to
influence the development of liver disease in AATD: for
example, most of the PI*MZ subjects with liver disease were
referred because reduced plasma AAT levels were detected in
the presence of alcoholic and/or hepatitis virus infection.4
However, data on liver disease in our series should be taken
with caution, for a number of reasons. First of all, it is known
that the prevalence of chronic liver disease in AATD increases
with age.30 Thus, the prevalence of liver disease in this study
might be affected by the relatively young age of the subjects.
Secondly, chronic liver disease may be asymptomatic for
years and, therefore, the condition might be underestimated
at the time of patient assessment by the physicians
participating in the screening programme (who are mostly
pulmonologists).
A final point should be made on the geographic distribu￾tion of the AATD variants. It is well known that the
prevalence of the PI*Z gene in Europe is higher in north￾western countries, with a decreasing gradient towards the
south-east.3 31 This gradient was respected in Italy, where
most PI*ZZ individuals in our series were found in northern
areas (fig 1). Interestingly, however, the rare AATD variants
displayed a different geographic distribution, peaking in
regions, such as Sardinia, with lower PI*ZZ prevalence. Since
the nomenclature of many rare AATD variants reflects
their probable southern Italian origin (Mprocida, Mpalermo,
Q0isola di procida, Q0trastevere), this raises the intriguing question
of whether rare AATD variants are more prevalent in areas
with a lower PI*Z gene frequency.
In conclusion, from the limited data obtained from the
Italian Registry for Severe AATD, it seems that individuals
carrying rare AATD variants are characterised by a rather
peculiar phenotypic profile, placing them in a precise position
within the spectrum of genotype-phenotype correlations in
AATD. These data, as well as the geographic distribution of
rare variants, need verification using larger, international
registries.
