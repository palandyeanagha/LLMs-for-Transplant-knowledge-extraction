Abstract
Background: Cystinosis is a multisystemic disease resulting from cystine accumulation primarily in kidney and
many other tissues. We intended to study the evolution of less commonly seen extrarenal complications of
cystinosis in a group of patients who have periods without cysteamine treatment.
Methods: Gastrointestinal and muscular complications of cystinosis were studied in a group of 21 patients.
Results: Twenty one patients were included in the study. Among them, 14 were homozygous and 3 were
compound heterozygous for CTNS mutations. The median age of diagnosis was 15 months (range; 5 months-14
years) and the mean age at last visit was 11.3 ± 6.5 years. Nine patients (42%) had end stage renal disease at a
mean age of 10.6 years (6.5–17 years). Abdominal ultrasonography and portal vein doppler ultrasonography were
performed in19 patients, 14 of them (74%) had hepatomegaly, 10 patients (53%) had granular pattern or
heterogeneity of liver. Only one patient had high transaminase levels and liver biopsy showed cystine crystals in
the liver. Eleven patients (58%) had borderline or increased portal vein minimum and maximum flow velocities. One
patient had CK level of 9024 U/L and electromyographic study showed active myopathic involvement. Two patients
were found to have gastroesaphageal reflux only and 4 patients were found to have esophageal remnants in
addition to reflux.
Conclusions: In addition to renal functions, extrarenal organs may be affected from cystine accumulation even in
childhood, especially in patients who are incompliant to treatment, resulting in complications such as swallowing
difficulty, hepatomegaly and portal hypertension.

Background
Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
disorder which is characterized by deficient excretion of cyst￾ine from lysosome to cytoplasm resulting in cystine crystal
accumulation in various organs including kidneys, cornea,
bone marrow, thyroid gland, liver, spleen and muscles [1].
It is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the CTNS gene en￾coding the lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin [2–4].
Wide spectrum of mutations of CTNS gene have been
shown in different populations and in Turkish patients [5].
Cystine accumulation takes place in renal tubuli first,
leading to renal Fanconi syndrome which is responsible
for all of the early manifestations of the disease like poly￾uria, polydipsia, rickets, feeding difficulties and growth
retardation [1, 6]. Eventually, cystine also accumulates in
glomeruli leading glomerular proteinuria and glomerulo￾sclerosis. Later, glomerular filtration rate declines with
time, serum creatinine levels start to rise after 5 years of
diagnosis and end stage renal disease (ESRD)

necessitating renal replacement therapy is seen around
7–12 years old unless treatment is initiated [1, 6, 7].
Successful treatment of cystinosis depends on early
diagnosis and effective treatment and consists of sup￾portive therapy and specific therapy with cysteamine [1,
6]. Cysteamine decreases intracellular cystine content by
90% and delays deterioration of renal function and pro￾motes growth [8–11].
Even if renal deterioration can be taken under control
with cysteamine, extrarenal accumulation of cystine con￾tinues and different aspects of cystinosis can be seen as
more patients reach to adult ages [1, 6]. Although
opthalmic and endocrine system complications are seen
frequently, many other systems are affected also like
gastrointestinal and muscular systems [1, 4, 6, 12]. In
terms of gastrointestinal system invovement, hepatomeg￾aly is a common finding usually without liver dysfunc￾tion [13, 14]. Cystine crystal accumulation activates
Kupffer cells and secreted vasoactive substances cause
vasoconstriction in microcirculation resulting in portal
hypertension [13–15]. Other gastrointestinal complica￾tions are feeding difficulty and anorexia. Direct accumu￾lation of cystine in lamina propria and muscles can also
result in oromotor dysfunction and dysphagia [16–18].
Muscular cystine accumulation is also found in skeletal
muscles especially in thenar and hypothenar muscles of
the hand and respiratory muscles causing restrictive type
of respiratory insufficiency [2, 19–21]. In this study, we
aimed to investigate gastrointestinal and muscular sys￾tem complications of cystinosis.
Methods
Design and setting
Twenty one historical cystinosis patients who were followed
up at Pediatric Nephrology Department of Hacettepe Uni￾versity were included in this prospective study. Cystinosis
was diagnosed on the basis of observation of corneal cystine
crystals via eye examination and/or an elevated leukocyte
cystine level (> 2 nmol half-cystine per mg protein) and/or
CTNS gene mutation(s). Adherence to cysteamine treat￾ment was determined by the physician according to the an￾swer given to the following question: how do you assess
your adherence to cysteamine: good, quite good, or pe￾riod(s) without treatment. All of the patients in the study
had period(s) without treatment. Medical records were
evaluated and age at diagnosis, consanguinity between par￾ents, clinical signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis,
initiation of cysteamine treatment, duration of clinical fol￾low up, serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rates
were recorded (Table 1).
At last visit, creatine kinase (CK) were measured in all
21 patients and nerve conduction studies (NCS) and,
needle electromyographic (EMG) examination were per￾formed in 8 patients who are older than 10 years.
Pharyngoeosaphagography with barium contrast was
performed in twenty patients and swallowing function
was evaluated in solid, semi-solid and liquid phases, es￾pecially chewing movements, elevation of palate, transi￾tion to pharyngeal phase, state of arytenoids and vocal
cords during swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux and
presence of remnants were noted. Videofloroscopy test
procedure; Standard modified barium test was applied to
patients. The patients were evaluated as thin liquid, pud￾ding consistency and solid consistency. In the test pro￾cedure, 3 ml liquid barium for liquid consistencies, 3 ml
pudding barium for pudding consistency, and standard
test biscuit dipped in barium for solid consistency were
used. During the test, oral phase, pharyngeal phase, eso￾phagal phase were evaluated in detail. For the oral phase;
oral transit time, presence of residue was noted. In the
pharyngeal stage, delay in swallowing reflex, pharyngeal
transition time, penetration, aspiration and nasal regur￾gitation were evaluated. The presence of aspiration and
penteration was assesed using the penetration aspiration
scale. In the esophagal phase, esophageal transition time,
backflow, reflux and dysmotility were evaluated.
At last visit, serum aminotransferase levels were mea￾sured and hepatobiliary and splenic ultrasonographic and
portal doppler ultrasonographic studies were performed,
direction of portal blood flow, presence of collateral veins,
portal vein diameter, portal vein minimum and maximum
velocities were measured. Upper gastrointestinal endo￾scopic study was performed in 5 patients to evaluate por￾tal hypertension in patients with splenomegaly.
Cysteamine treatment was started to all patients at diag￾nosis, average inital cysteamine dose was 60 mg/kg/day.
The patients were grouped into two as patients who had
leukocyte cystine level (LCL) at or above 2 nmol half cyst￾ine/mg protein and below 2 nmol half cystine/mg protein.
Genetic analyses
All genetic testing was performed at the Hacettepe Uni￾versity Nephrogenetics Laboratory. Briefly, DNA was ex￾tracted from peripheral blood following the standard
phenol-chloroform protocol. All exons of the CTNS
gene together with their adjacent intron junctions were
analyzed via direct sequencing using BigDye v.3.1 chem￾istry and an ABI3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosys￾tems, Foster City, CA). The National Center for
Biotechnology Information transcript variant 1 of CTNS
(NM_001031681.2), corresponding to ENSEMBL tran￾script ENST00000381870.7, was used as a reference se￾quence. Analysis of the CTNS gene was not performed
in patients whose parents did not consent.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistical analysis methods were used to
evaluate demographic and clinical data. Mean,

median, SD, and interquartile range (IQR) were calcu￾lated for numeric variables. Frequency tables were
used to describe categorical data. The Mann–Whitney
U test or independent samples t test was used to
compare two independent samples. All data were
analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v.21
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
The study protocol was approved by the Hacettepe
University Ethics Committee (HEK 09/134–42) and car￾ried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Results
Patient characteristics
Twenty one patients (14 boys and 7 girls) were included
in the study. Among them, 17 patients consented genetic
testing, 14 were homozygous and 3 were compound het￾erozygous for CTNS mutations. To calculate allele fre￾quencies only one patient from each family was
considered (even if a family had multiple affected indi￾viduals) (i.e. 16 patients, 32 alleles). The most common
mutation was c.1015G > A [p.Gly339Arg] which was
present in 6 alleles (19%) followed by c.681G > A
[p.Glu227Glu] (5 alleles; 15.6%). The median age of
cystinosis diagnosis was 15 months (range; 5 months-14
years) and the mean age at last visit was 11.3 ± 6.5 years.
In total, 14 patients (66.7%) were diagnosed before 2
years of age and 8 patients were diagnosed at or before
1 year of age. The mean period of follow up after diagno￾sis of cystinosis was 9.5 years (range; 0.5–20 years). Par￾ental consanguinity was observed in 10 families (48%).
Two patients (14,2%) had cystinotic siblings in the fam￾ily. The most common symptom at diagnosis was poly￾uria (14 patients; 66.7%). Other symptoms at diagnosis
were as follows; growth retardation (13 patients, 62%),
polyuria (10 patients, 48%), vomiting (7 patients, 33%),
inability to walk (3 patients, 14%). At the time of diagno￾sis, the most common laboratory abnormalities were
metabolic acidosis (17 patients, 81%) and proteinuria (17
patients, 81%). Median LCL of the whole group was 2.7
(IQR; 1.5–4.1) nmol half cystine/mg protein.
Renal functions
At the time of the study, three patients (14.3%) had
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 90 mL/min/
1.73m2 and nine patients (42%) had ESRD at a mean age
of 10.6 years (6.5–17 years) and needed renal replace￾ment therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or renal
transplantation) (Table 1). Five of nine patients had
renal transplantation at a mean age of 15.3 years (range;
9–29 years), all but one have normal graft function. One
patient experienced rejection due to inadherence to im￾munosuppressive drugs. Other patients were in various
stages of chronic kidney disease.
Gastrointestinal system findings
Abdominal ultrasonography and portal vein doppler
ultrasonography were performed in19 patients (two pa￾tients did not give informed consent), 14 of them (74%)
had hepatomegaly, 10 patients (53%) had granular pat￾tern or heterogeneity of liver. In cohort, only one patient
had high transaminase levels and liver biopsy showed
cystine crystals in the liver. The most common alleles in
patients with hepatomegaly and/or granular pattern or
heterogeneity of liver are c.18_21 del (p.Thr7PhefsTer7)
and c140 + 1G > T (4 alleles each, 16.7%).
Eleven patients (58%) had borderline or increased portal
vein minimum and maximum flow velocities (minimum
19–35 cm/sec, maximum 35–51 cm/sec), all patients had
hepatopedal flow in portal vein and none of them had col￾lateral veins. Portal vein diameters ranged between 7,5–
12 mm, 10 patients (53%) had increased portal vein diam￾eter according to age. Ten patients (53%) were found to
have splenomegaly, 5 of these patients (26%) also had in￾creased portal vein diameter. Endoscopic evaluation was
performed in these 4 patients with splenomegaly but no
sign of portal hypertension was observed. The most com￾mon allele in patients with splenomegaly is c.18_21 del
(p.Thr7PhefsTer7) (4 alleles, 20%).
The patients who had LCL at or above 2 nmol/mg had
gastrointestinal complications more frequently than the
patients with LCL below 2 nmol/mg, but this difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.625) (Fig. 1).
Muscular and swallowing functions
In our group, patient no.4 had minimal muscle weakness
on physical examination which had been attributed to
another sign of cystinosis. However, he had CK level of
9024 U/L (patient no. 4) (Table 1). NCS that performed
at median, tibial and sural nerves were normal. However,
needle EMG examination showed active myopathic in￾volvement at both proximal (biceps brachii and iliop￾soas) and distal (tibialis anterior) muscles. There was
short duration, low amplitude, polyphasic motor unit
potentials with early recruitment on voluntary activity
and abnormal spontaneous activities (fibrillation and
positive sharp waves, complex repetitive discharges)
which were more prominent at proximal muscles. He
was inadherent to the cysteamine treatment. The genetic
analysis of this patient showed homozygous c.18_21 del
[p.Thr7Phefs*7] mutation. Other patients had normal
CK levels and normal electromyography (EMG) (eight
patients older than 10 years).
Modify barium swallow test; Except for the 5-month￾old baby, all patients received a modified barium swal￾lowing test procedure. None of the patients had any
problem in the oral and pharyngeal phase of swallowing
in all test consistencies. Aspiration and penetration were
not observed. No residue was observed in the oral and
pharyngeal regions. In esophageal phase examination of
swallowing, visible reflux was detected in 2 patients
(10%). In 4 patients (20%), esophageal motility problem
and delay in esophageal transition period were observed.
The mean age of these patients was 15 years (4–29
years), 3 of them had ESRD (Table 1). Fifty seven per￾cent of the patients who had LCL at or above 2 nmol/
mg had swallowing dysfunction however only 14% of the
Topaloglu et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:242 Page 4 of 8

patients who had less than 2 nmol/mg of LCL had swal￾lowing dysfunction (p = 0.545).
Discussion
Cystinosis affects renal tubuli and causes renal failure in
the first decade if left untreated. However renal trans￾plantation and cysteamine treatment prolonged the sur￾vival and changed the appearance of disease from a renal
disorder to a multisystemic metabolic disease. Therefore,
analysis of other systemic complications of cystinosis is
also crucial. In this study, we have investigated extrare￾nal complications and impact of treatment on progres￾sion of these complications.
Age of the patients in the study ranged between 6
months to 29 years allowing to see complications in dif￾ferent age groups. Almost half of the parents of patients
were related to each other and consanguinity between
parents was more frequent than average of Turkish
population (21%) [22]. More than half of the patients
were diagnosed before 2 years of age and 8 patients were
diagnosed at or before 1 year of age which could be con￾sidered fairly early [1].
Patients were followed up approximately 10 years on
average, GFR and creatinine levels were normal in early
childhood as expected. Although half of the patients were
diagnosed before 2 years of age and cysteamine treatment
was started to all the patients at time of diagnosis, about
half of patients had ESRD at 10.6 years. This may be due
to the inadherence to treatment and high LCL levels. This
finding is consistent with literature as it was shown that
cysteamine therapy slows the renal progression of the dis￾ease especially if it was started before age 5 and age of
renal failure directly correlates with compliance to therapy
which is measured with LCL [23, 24].
Among 5 transplanted patients, only one patient had
rejection after transplantation and that was due to inad￾herence to immunosuppressive regimen, other patients
who had transplantation did well afterwards. None had
rejection or recurrence concordant with previous studies
[1, 5, 25, 26].
The most frequent (50–70%) of CTNS mutations in
Northen Europe is a large 57-kb which constitutes 75%
of the mutated alleles in patients of Northern European
descent with cystinosis [27]; however, the spectrum of
the mutations varies according to geography. Traveling
from Northern Europe and America to the Southern
Hemisphere, the frequency of the 57-kb deletion de￾creases. Mason et al. [28] studied CTNS mutations in
Italian patients with cystinosis and observed that the 57-
kb deletion was present in only 17% of the patients.
Topaloglu et al. studied the genetic spectrum in a large
group of pediatric patients from a national cystinosis
Fig. 1 Percentage of the patients with gastrointestinal complications according to leucocyte cystine level

registry and confirmed that none of the patients had
thee 57-kb CTNS deletion. In that study, the most com￾mon alleles in Turkey is c.681G.A (p.E227E; 31%),
c.1015G.A (p.Gly339Arg; 22%) and c.18_21 del
(p.Thr7Phefs*7; 14%) [29]. Consistent with this result, in
our study, the most common mutation was c.1015G > A
[p.Gly339Arg] (20%) followed by c.681G > A [p.Glu227-
Glu] (16.7%).
Myopathic complications of cystinosis are expected to
be seen in adulthood [30]. Recently, Brodin-Sartorius re￾ported that 22 out of 86 adult cystinosis patients had
myopathy [23]. In our study, an 11 year old patient was
found to have high CK levels and active myopathic find￾ings on electromyographic examination, which is fairly
early. He is a carrier of c.18_21 del [p.Thr7Phefs*7] on
CTNS gene which is also a common mutation in Turkey.
This deletion was first defined by Town et al. and causes
a frameshift at exon 7 and forms a stop codon. He did
not have any complaints of weakness however myopathy
could be found before patient had symptoms as showed
by Vester et al. [19]. Besides to the inadherence to the
cysteamine treatment, this involvement may be associ￾ated with the severity of the mutation. This case also
highlighted that muscular involvement can be also ob￾served in pediatric patients in earlier ages according to
the severity of the mutation and adherence to the cyste￾amine treatment. Swallowing dysfunction is also said to
be seen in adolescent ages especially increasing after 16
years [18, 19]. In different adults series, swallowing im￾pairment was observed in 24–73% of the patients [18,
23]. In our pediatric group, approximately 30% of the
patients had swallowing impairment. The mean age of
patients was 15 years. It is important to diagnose this
complication in younger patients because adequate nu￾trition and growth is very essential in this group of pa￾tients. Beyond adequate nutrition, swallowing is also
important in the prognosis of the cystinosis patient.
Brodin-Sartorius investigate the prognosis of cystinosis
in a late adolescents and adults. They separated the pa￾tients into three groups: patients who started cysteamine
therapy before 5 years of age, after 5 years of age and
those who were not treated before development of
ESRD. In the group treated after 5 years of age, the most
common cause of death were respiratory distress due to
swallowing impairment and neurological reasons. Our
study showed that swallowing impairment can be ob￾served in younger ages in patients who were inadherent
to therapy [23].
The data regarding to the gastrointestinal system in￾volvement pediatric cystinosis patients is scarce in the
literature. Hepatomegaly without liver failure is a com￾mon finding in cystinosis, it is a result of cytokine reac￾tion to cystine crystals and collagen deposition without
accompanying fibrosis and bridging necrosis [1, 5, 13–
15], which is also common in our group, hepatomegaly
was found in three quarters of patients and change in
liver pattern in more than half of the patients. Cystine
accumulation in liver also causes secretion of vasoactive
substances that results in vasoconstriction and portal
hypertension [1, 5, 13, 14]. More than half of our pa￾tients had splenomegaly and also had increased portal
vein diameter leading to possible diagnosis of portal
hypertension however no sign of portal hypertension
was found in endoscopic studies. Nevertheless these pa￾tients should be followed up as splenomegaly together
with increased portal vein diameter may progress to por￾tal hypertension with development of reverse flow and
collaterals incresing the morbidity and mortality of the
patients [31].
Gastrointestinal complications were seen less in pa￾tients who had appropriate treatment with low levels of
LCL. However this did not reach to statistical signifi￾cance. This may be due to relative small number of the
patients. This support the fact that cysteamine treatment
decrease cystine accumulation in many organs other
than kidneys and cysteamine treatment slows down the
progression of disease not only in kidneys but also extra￾renal organs as well [23, 31].
Conclusion
We concluded that in addition to renal functions, many
extrarenal organs may be affected from cystine accumu￾lation even in childhood especially in patients who are
incompliant to therapy, resulting in complications such
as swallowing difficulty, respiratory problems, hepato￾megaly and portal hypertension. Although our results
are not representative for well-treated patiens, children
with cystinosis should be followed up in a multidisciplin￾ary approach besides focusing on renal complications.
