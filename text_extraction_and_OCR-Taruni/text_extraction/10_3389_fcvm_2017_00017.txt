The microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important influence on human health 
and many of the comorbidities that affect patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT) 
have been shown to involve changes in gut bacterial populations. Thus, microbiome 
changes in an individual patient may have important health implications after SOT but 
this area remains understudied. We describe changes in the composition of the fecal 
microbiome from a pediatric heart transplant recipient before and >2.5 years after he 
underwent repeated fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI). With both documented episodes of CDI, there was marked loss 
of bacterial diversity with overgrowth of Proteobacteria (>98.9% of phyla identified) 
associated with symptomatic colitis that was corrected after FMT. We hypothesize that a 
second CDI occurring after FMT was related to incomplete restoration of normal bowel 
flora post-FMT with relative deficiencies of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and 
the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Following the second FMT, there 
was a gradual shift in gut bacterial composition coincident with the recipient develop￾ing lymphonodular hyperplasia of the colon and painless hematochezia that resolved 
with discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). This case documents dynamic 
changes in the bacterial microbiome after FMT and suggests that MMF may influence 
the gut microbiome with consequences for the patient.

INTRODUCTION
Changes in the microbiome, the collection of microbes co￾existing with the human host, may influence patient outcome 
after solid organ transplantation (SOT) (1, 2) but examples 
are lacking, particularly in children. We (unpublished data) 
and others have noted significant changes in the murine gut 
microbiome in response to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 
other immunosuppressive drugs (3, 4). Increased susceptibility 
to infection is a known complication following SOT and the rate 
of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in SOT patients may be up 
to five times higher in comparison to other hospitalized patients 
(5). Antibiotics are a commonly reported risk factor for CDI due 
to depletion of protective bacteria, and reconstitution with fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising therapeutic 
option that has been successfully applied to SOT patients and 
children (6, 7). Immunosuppression causing changes in the gut 
microbiome could potentially contribute to increased risk for 
CDI, influence the host response to CDI and FMT or increase 
the risk for developing complications post-SOT.
Utilizing 16S rRNA sequencing of serial stool samples, 
we followed the course of a pediatric heart transplant recipi￾ent who developed recurrent CDI treated with FMT on two 
separate occasions, by enema and oral capsules. Subsequent 
development of colonic lymphonodular hyperplasia was attrib￾uted to MMF. We describe changes in the composition of this 
patient’s fecal microbiome over time and relate them to clinical 
symptoms.
CASE REPORT
A 5-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of diarrhea that 
had progressed over the previous month to become bloody. The 
patient had undergone ABO-incompatible (donor AB, recipient 
A) heart transplantation at 10 months of age for idiopathic dilated 
cardiomyopathy and had been maintained on tacrolimus (levels of 
5–7 μg/L at the time of presentation) and MMF (20–30 mg/kg/day 
divided BID). Stool was positive for C. difficile toxin, and he was 
treated with oral metronidazole. Transient improvement was noted 
but symptoms (bloody and watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, 
increased flatulence) recurred once the antibiotics were stopped and 
stool again tested positive for C. difficile antigen and the toxin B gene. 
He was treated with oral vancomycin and had normal stools but 
symptoms recurred with cessation of antibiotics. He subsequently 
experienced three relapses despite treatment with vancomycin, 
nitazoxanide, and Florastor® (probiotic containing Saccharomyces 
boulardii) with symptoms returning 4–14 days after stopping anti￾biotics. Due to the recurrent CDI, the patient underwent FMT via
enema with stool donated from his healthy asymptomatic mother 
(8). The procedure was well tolerated with no complications and the 
patient’s stools normalized within 1 week.
He remained clinically well until presenting 3  months later 
with fever and painful swelling of the left neck. He was diagnosed 
with cervical adenitis and treated with intravenous cefotaxime 
and clindamycin. After 1 week, the patient was discharged home 
on amoxicillin and clavulanic acid to complete a total of 14 days of 
antibiotic therapy. He then presented 3 months later with a 3-week 
history of increasing amounts of blood in the stool, abdominal 
cramping, increased flatulence, foul smelling, and slightly loose 
stools (not large watery stools as previously pre-FMT). Stool was 
positive for C. difficile toxin by PCR testing for the toxin B gene, 
and he was treated with oral vancomycin. The diarrhea persisted 
and he underwent a second FMT, from the same donor but this 
time using oral capsules (unpublished data), 253 days after his 
initial presentation with resolution of symptoms.
After the second FMT, the patient remained clinically well with 
normal stools but presented to the Gastroenterology clinic 2 years 
after his first presentation with streaks of bright red blood passed 
per rectum. He had no diarrhea or abdominal cramping and his 
stools were described as normal and were negative for C. difficile
toxin. He was noted to have perianal erythema and underwent 
sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy. Endoscopy revealed non￾specific lymphonodular hyperplasia and very mild eosinophilic 
colitis. His painless hematochezia persisted despite treatment with 
prednisone, ketotifen, intrarectal 5-ASA, and hydrocortisone foam 
but slowly resolved after the MMF was stopped and he was switched 
to sirolimus. Six months after stopping the MMF, all symptoms had 
resolved and he has remained clinically well with no recurrence of 
GI symptoms on a regimen of tacrolimus (target levels of 5–7 μg/L) 
and sirolimus (target levels of 3–5 μg/L).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Specimens
This study was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics 
Board at the University of Calgary (study ID REB13-0576). All 
subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Stool samples were collected from the 
donor and patient/recipient over a 2.6-year period (days 0–967 
after his initial presentation) and stored at −80°C until processed. 
DNA was extracted from feces using mechanical and enzymatic 
digestion followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and cleanup 
as previously described (9). Purified DNA was used for PCR 
amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3/V4 regions (10). 
Libraries were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq 
in the Nicole Perkins Microbial Communities Core Laboratory at 
the University of Calgary.
Data Analysis
Processing was done using the UPARSE pipeline (11). Taxonomy 
was assigned to the representative sequences using the RDP naive 
Bayesian classifier (12). Downstream analysis of the final OTU 
table was done in R using phyloseq 1.16.2 (13). Beta diversity 
was evaluated using the weighted UniFrac distance metric (14) 
on normalized OTU counts and visualized with non-metric mul￾tidimensional scaling. OTUs that differed significantly between 
the donor and the two recipient groups were identified using 
generalized linear models (15).
RESULTS
Examination of the different bacterial phyla in the patient’s feces 
when he was symptomatic with CDI, revealed that Proteobacteria 
almost completely dominated (>98.9% of identified phyla) and

samples collected from the donor and recipient before and after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The five donor samples are stable with a predominance of 
Firmicutes (yellow). When the patient has symptomatic CDI, there is an almost complete replacement of normal stool flora (dominated by Firmicutes) with 
Proteobacteria (pink).

Shannon (alpha) diversity reflects diversity within a sample. For the five 
sample groups examined (Donor, Post_FMT1, Post_FMT2, Pre_FMT1, and 
Pre_FMT2), there is a marked loss of bacterial diversity within the two 
samples prior to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) compared to the 
pooled Donor and Post-FMT samples that show comparable diversity.

had replaced the normal microbiome, which consists primarily of 
members of the phylum Firmicutes as seen consistently in the five 
donor samples and in the patient’s post-FMT samples (Figure 1). 
With symptomatic CDI, the predominant genera were Klebsiella
and Escherichia/Shigella (data not shown). After FMT, the patient’s 
microbiota was no longer dominated by Proteobacteria and 
assumed a composition resembling that seen in the donor samples. 
These changes coincided with the resolution of his CDI-related 
symptoms.
Active CDI resulted in a marked decrease in alpha diversity 
that was reversed by FMT (Figure 2). Looking at changes in 
beta diversity over time (Figure 3), we see that both samples 
collected from the patient at the time of CDI (R0, Pre-FMT1 
and R247, Pre-FMT2) cluster closely together. After the first 
FMT, the stool composition remained relatively tightly clus￾tered (blue circles) but was distinct from that of the donor. 
The second FMT initially caused the stool composition to shift 
towards the donor (R253) but we see that, over a relatively 
short period (23 days until R276), there is a shift away from 
the donor and back toward the post-FMT1 samples. However, 
during the 2 years after the second FMT, the patient samples 
became increasingly distinct from the donor and the early 
post-FMT samples. This shift coincides with the patient 
developing painless hematochezia and apparent MMF-related 
lymphonodular hyperplasia of the colon.
Although after each FMT alpha diversity is restored and the 
patient samples cluster together with respect to their beta diversity 
(blue and green circles in Figure 3), there were distinct differences 
in the relative abundances of the bacterial phyla post-FMT1 and 
post-FMT2 (Figure 4). After the first FMT, the patient remained 
deficient in bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes and relatively 
deficient in Firmicutes with a particular paucity of the bacterial 
families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae.

DISCUSSION
In our patient, a pediatric heart transplant recipient, we have 
described the dynamic shifts in the intestinal microbiota that 
occurred with CDI, therapeutic FMT, and chronic MMF exposure. 
Others have noted that CDI is associated with disruption of the gut 
microbiome, specifically a loss of overall diversity and alteration in 
microbial composition with a dominance of Proteobacteria (16), 
which is consistent with our observations. Given that C. difficile
is a member of Firmicutes, the Proteobacteria do not represent 
CDI but rather the associated dysbiosis. The relative deficiency 
of beneficial members of Firmicutes (e.g., butyrate-producing 
Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) has been seen after failed 
FMT in patients with CDI and in asymptomatic C. difficile carriers 
(16, 17) and may have contributed to the fragility of the micro￾biome after FMT1 for our patient. The need for repeat FMT may 
be more common in the SOT population. Both patients reported 
by Friedman-Moraco et  al. required repeat FMT for complete 
resolution of their diarrhea symptoms and the success rate for 
FMT in immunocompromised patients was only 79% compared 
to an initial success rate of 91% in immunocompetent individuals 
(18, 19). It is speculated that SOT recipients may have more severe 
dysbiosis with damaged microbiota due to immunosuppression 
and antibiotic use and sequential FMT may be necessary to cor￾rect the alterations in the intestinal microbiota (18).
Fecal microbiota transplantation acts to restore Bacteroidetes 
and Firmicutes and eliminates Proteobacteria (16), consistent 
with our findings. Looking at bacterial abundance more closely, 
we see that before the first FMT, there was a predominance of 
the Genus Klebsiella. However, when his symptoms recurred 
and just before receiving the second FMT, the dominant genera 
included both Klebsiella and Escherichia/Shigella. This differ￾ence may be related to his treatment with antibiotics but could 
also be related to the incomplete restoration provided by the 
first FMT.
The donor microbiota remained relatively stable over the 
9  months of the available samples. This stability contrasts 
with the dynamic changes of the patient samples over time. 
The patient’s samples cluster both pre- and early post-FMT in 
distinct groups from the donor with only a single sample 4 days 
Figure 3 | Dynamic beta diversity in our pediatric transplant patient. Changes in beta diversity reflect changes in composition between samples. The 
non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot shows changes in beta diversity for donor and recipient stool samples over time. The five donor samples (red 
circles) remain clustered together with stable diversity but there are large changes in the patient samples before (purple and yellow circles) and after fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) (blue and green circles).

post-FMT2 (R253) being closely associated with the donor 
cluster. By 3 months post-FMT2, the patient samples (R337 and 
R967) have become distinct from both the donor and the early 
post-FMT samples. We ascribe at least some of these changes 
to the patient’s immunosuppression, with MMF being the most 
likely candidate.
Eight months after successful treatment of recurrent CDI with 
the second FMT, the patient developed painless hematochezia 
related to lymphonodular hyperplasia of the colon. Although the 
patient had a strong history of atopy, he did not respond to mul￾tiple anti-inflammatory therapies and ultimately only improved 
after the MMF was discontinued. We suggest that in this case 
the MMF was responsible for both the colonic tissue changes, 
which are non-specific and have been associated with infection 
and allergy in children (20), and changes in the microbiome. 
However, this conclusion remains speculative since this is only 
an observational study and population composition at the phy￾lum level as shown in Figure 1 is clearly inadequate to illustrate 
this change. Studies are currently ongoing in our laboratory to 
explore the relationship between immunosuppressive drugs and 
the microbiome.
CONCLUSION
We have presented sequential changes in the gut microbiome of a 
pediatric patient who developed recurrent CDI after heart trans￾plantation and was successfully treated with two separate FMTs 
249 days apart. Changes in bacterial composition are consistent 
with prior observations in immunocompetent individuals, but we 
hypothesize that at least some of the changes observed are related 
to the effects of his chronic immunosuppression, particularly 
MMF, on the gut microbiome. This single observation remains to 
be confirmed in larger patient series.
