Mortality Risk Factors for Hepatolithiasis
Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 21 (12), 3647-3654
Introduction
Albeit a benign disease, hepatolithiasis can lead to 
cholangiocarcinoma and secondary biliary cirrhosis due 
to repeated cholangitis and stones (Kubo et al., 1995; Kim 
et al., 2015a; Suzuki et al., 2018). Therefore, complete 
removal of hepatolithiasis and elimination of bile stasis 
due to bile duct strictures are necessary for the prevention 
of repeated cholangitis and stone recurrence. As the most 
effective treatment of hepatolithiasis, liver resection can 
remove both the intrahepatic stones and the bile duct with 
Abstract
Background: Cholangiocarcinoma and secondary biliary cirrhosis can develop after liver resection for hepatolithiasis 
and are causes of hepatolithiasis-related death. We determined potential risk factors for hepatolithiasis-related 
death and subsequent cholangiocarcinoma, including precancerous lesions such as biliary intraepithelial neoplasia 
(BilIN) and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct, in patients undergoing liver resection for hepatolithiasis. 
Methods: The study cohort included 62 patients who underwent liver resection for hepatolithiasis without concomitant 
cholangiocarcinoma and had surgical specimens available for pathological examination. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were conducted to examine risk factors associated with subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after hepatolithiasis 
and hepatolithiasis-related death. In 28 patients with BilIN lesions, the specimens were immunohistochemically stained 
for γ-H2AX and S100P. Results: In the study cohort, the causes of death were subsequent cholangiocarcinoma, biliary 
cirrhosis, and other diseases in 5, 3, and 7 patients, respectively. Liver atrophy, precancerous lesions, postoperative 
repeated cholangitis, and jaundice for ≥1 week during the follow-up period were risk factors for hepatolithiasis￾related death. Multivariate analysis showed that liver atrophy and precancerous lesions were independent risk 
factors for hepatolithiasis-related death. Liver atrophy or precancerous lesions were also risk factors for subsequent 
cholangiocarcinoma by univariate analysis. The positive expression of γ-H2AX and S100P was observed in 18 and 14 of 
the 28 BilIN lesions, respectively. Conclusions: Liver atrophy and precancerous lesions with malignant transformation 
were risk factors not only for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma but also hepatolithiasis-related death after liver resection 
for hepatolithiasis, indicating that long-term follow-up is necessary even after liver resection in patients harboring 
these risk factors.

strictures responsible for repeated cholangitis and stone 
formation (Uenishi et al., 2009). However, secondary 
biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma, which can 
develop even after liver resection in some patients, have 
been reported as unfavorable prognostic factors (Suzuki 
et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015b).
Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) and intraductal 
neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB), which are considered 
as precancerous or early cancerous lesions (WHO, 
2019), are observed in hepatolithiasis, primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, and occupational cholangiocarcinoma caused

by chlorinated organic solvents (Chen et al., 2001; Itatsu 
et al., 2007; Kinoshita et al., 2016). Chronic inflammation 
causes malignant transformation of these precancerous or 
early cancerous lesions, eventually leading to invasive 
cholangiocarcinoma (Nakanuma et al., 2009).
Although risk factors for hepatolithiasis-related death 
and subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after liver resection 
for hepatolithiasis were reported by a few studies (Kim 
et al., 2015b; Suzuki et al., 2018), precancerous lesions 
such as BilIN and IPNB have not been evaluated. In the 
present study, we investigated risk factors, including 
precancerous lesions, for hepatolithiasis-related death 
and subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after liver resection 
for hepatolithiasis.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Surgical specimens of 72 patients who underwent 
liver resection for hepatolithiasis at the Department 
of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery in Osaka City 
University Hospital between 1978 and 2017 were available 
for pathological examination. Of these, nine patients with 
concomitant cholangiocarcinoma and one patient who 
died of bacterial endocarditis after surgery (in-hospital 
death) were excluded from the study. Therefore, the study 
cohort included the remaining 62 patients. The median 
follow-up period from surgery until death or the end of the 
study (July 31, 2019) was 3870 (range, 389–10958) days. 
This study was conducted following the guidelines of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Osaka City University Graduate School of 
Medicine (No. 4013).
Outcomes and prognostic factors after liver resection
The outcomes after liver resection for hepatolithiasis 
and prognostic factors were assessed by survival rates after 
liver resection. The causes of death were also investigated. 
Variables potentially associated with survival were 
based on the results of previous studies and our clinical 
experience (Liu et al., 2011; Suzuki et al., 2014; Kim et 
al., 2015b). The following variables were included in 
the present study: age (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex, symptom 
duration (≤10 vs >10 years), history of cholecystectomy, 
history of choledocho-enterostomy, serum levels of 
carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 
19-9 (CA 19-9), preoperative cholangitis, stone location, 
bile duct stenosis, bile duct dilatation, type of surgical 
procedure, biliary reconstruction, liver atrophy of affected 
segment(s) defined as more than 50% reduction in liver 
volume on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) (Ham, 1979), precancerous 
lesions (BilIN and IPNB), residual stones after surgery, 
stone recurrence, jaundice for ≥1 week during the 
follow-up period, and postoperative repeated cholangitis. 
Patients who were administered oral or intravenous 
antibiotics for cholangitis twice or more per year and those 
with stone recurrence caused by cholangitis were classified 
as those with repeated cholangitis (Aota et al., 2019).
Pathological examination
Pathological findings were evaluated according to the 
World Health Organization classification for digestive 
system tumors (WHO, 2019). Briefly, BilIN lesions 
were pathologically classified as low-grade BilIN and 
high-grade BilIN according to the cellular and structural 
features. Low-grade BilIN was characterized by mild 
cytoarchitectural atypia including a predominantly 
flat growth pattern, pseudostratification of nuclei, and 
a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. High-grade BilIN 
was characterized by more complex patterns, such as 
micropapillae and tall papillae. IPNB was defined as 
a grossly visible premalignant lesion with intraductal 
papillary or villous growth of biliary epithelium.
The surgical specimens were available for 
immunohistochemical examination in 28 of the 29 
patients with BilIN or IPNB lesions. The specimens were 
immunohistochemically stained for γ-H2AX and S100P. 
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using 
primary antibodies against S100P (rabbit monoclonal 
antibody, ab133554; Abcam, Cambridge, England) and 
γ-H2AX (rabbit monoclonal antibody, ab81299; Abcam), 
as reported previously (Kinoshita et al., 2016). The tissue 
sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated 
through ethanol series and phosphate-buffered saline. 
Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave treatment 
using a citrate buffer (pH 6). Endogenous peroxidase was 
blocked with 0.3% H2
O2
 in methanol for 30 min, followed 
by incubation with G-Block (Genostaff, Tokyo, Japan) 
and the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector, Burlingame, 
USA). The sections were incubated with the anti-S100P 
or γ-H2AX rabbit monoclonal antibody overnight at 4o
C, 
followed by a biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, 
Santa Clara, USA) for 30 min at room temperature and the 
addition of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei, 
Tokyo, Japan) for 5 min at room temperature. Peroxidase 
activity was visualized by diaminobenzidine. The sections 
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (MUTO, 
Tokyo, Japan), dehydrated, and mounted with Malinol 
mounting medium (MUTO). Multiple fields in sections 
were observed under ×200 magnification, and areas with 
strongest nuclear staining for γ-H2AX and S100P were 
selected to determine the proportions of cells that were 
positive and negative for γ-H2AX and S100P.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were compared using Student’s 
t test, and categorical variables were compared using 
Fisher’s exact test. Cumulative survival rates were 
calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared 
by the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model 
with stepwise variable selection was used for multivariate 
analysis. Factors with a P value of <0.1 in the univariate 
analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis. A 
P value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical 
significance. All analyses were performed using EZR.

Mortality Risk Factors for Hepatolithiasis
Results
Characteristics of patients who died of hepatolithiasis￾related causes
In the present study, 5 of the 62 patients developed 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma and 15 of the 62 
patients died during the follow-up period. The causes of 
death were subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after liver 
resection, secondary biliary cirrhosis, pneumonia, and 
other malignancies in 5, 3, 2, and 5 patients, respectively. 
Therefore, 8 of 62 patients died of hepatolithiasis-related 
causes including cholangiocarcinoma and secondary 
biliary cirrhosis.
The characteristics of the five patients with subsequent 
cholangiocarcinoma are summarized in Table 1. 
Cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed between 2 years 3 
months and 18 years after the liver resection; the median 
time from surgery to cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis was 
ten years. The site of cholangiocarcinoma was adjacent 
to the stump of the resected bile duct in all patients. 
The representative CT images, surgical specimens, and 
pathological findings of Patient No. 5 are shown in Figure 
1. The patient underwent left lateral sectionectomy for 
hepatolithiasis in the lateral segment. The high- and 
low-grade BilIN lesions were detected in the resected liver. 
A space-occupying lesion observed in CT images indicated 
the subsequent development of cholangiocarcinoma in the 
left hepatic duct at 3 years 9 months after the first operation. 
Although medial segmentectomy was performed, curative 
resection could not be performed because the intrahepatic 
bile ducts were involved. The pathological examination 
of the surgical specimen revealed cholangiocarcinoma

bile duct stenosis/dilatation in the remaining liver, leading 
to secondary biliary cirrhosis. In the other five patients, our 
treatment improved their symptoms. Moreover, no stone 
recurrence was found in patients who underwent biliary 
reconstruction in our surgery.
Risk factors for hepatolithiasis-related death
Risk factors for hepatolithiasis-related death were 
evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses, 
which revealed that liver atrophy, precancerous lesions, 
postoperative repeated cholangitis, and jaundice for ≥1 
week during the follow-up period were risk factors for 
hepatolithiasis-related death (Table 2). The hepatolithiasis￾related death-free survival rate was significantly lower 
in the patients with precancerous lesions compared to 
those without the lesions (P = 0.0149, Figure 2). Jaundice 
for ≥1 week during the follow-up period was included 
as a potential risk factor in the multivariate analysis 
because the patients with jaundice for ≥1 week during the 
follow-up period overlapped with those who developed 
postoperative repeated cholangitis. The multivariate

the remnant cholangiocarcinoma at 3 months after the 
second operation.
Three patients died of secondary biliary cirrhosis. 
One patient with intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones 
in bilateral lobes with a history of cholecystectomy 
underwent left lobectomy because the left lobe was 
severely atrophied. However, the patient had repeated 
cholangitis with jaundice due to residual stricture of 
the bile duct and residual stones in the right lobe. The 
remaining two patients had repeated cholangitis with 
jaundice for ≥1 week and stone reformation due to the 
residual stricture of the bile duct in the remnant liver.
All eight patients with symptoms due to stone or bile 
duct stricture after surgery, except two treated in other 
hospitals and one for which no records were available, 
underwent treatment for stone removal or improvement 
of bile duct stricture by percutaneous transhepatic 
cholangioscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, 
or surgery. However, the above mentioned three patients

analysis showed as follows; liver atrophy (risk ratio 
= 10.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.69–64.2, P value 
= 0.011), precancerous lesions (risk ratio = 12.7, 95% 
confidence interval = 1.36–118, P value = 0.026), and 
postoperative jaundice (risk ratio = 0.294, 95% confidence 
interval = 0.0631–1.37, P value = 0.12) (Supplementary 
Table 1). These results indicated that liver atrophy and 
precancerous lesions were independent risk factors for 
hepatolithiasis-related death.
Risk factors for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma
The characteristics of patients with and without 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma are summarized in Table 
3. Briefly, the proportions of patients with liver atrophy 
or precancerous lesions were significantly higher among 
patients with subsequent cholangiocarcinoma than in 
those without subsequent cholangiocarcinoma.
Precancerous lesions in hepatolithiasis
By pathological examination, BilIN and IPNB were 
found in 28 and 1 patient, respectively. The results of 
the immunohistochemical staining to assess the positive 
expression of γ-H2AX and S100P in the BilIN lesions of 
28 patients are shown in Fig. 3. The positive expression 
of γ-H2AX was observed in 18 patients, and the positive 
expression of S100P was observed in 14 patients, 
indicating the presence of DNA injury and malignant 
transformation in many of the BilIN lesions.
All five patients who developed subsequent 
cholangiocarcinoma had BilIN or IPNB lesions, and the 
positive expressions of γ-H2AX and S100P were detected 
in the BilIN lesions of four patients. The surgical specimen 
of IPNB lesions was not available. In contrast, patients 
without γ-H2AX or S100P expressions did not develop 
postoperative carcinogenesis. Two of three patients who 
died of secondary biliary cirrhosis had BilIN lesions, 
and the positive expressions of γ-H2AX and S100P were 
detected in the BilIN lesions of one of the two patients.
Discussion
The present study revealed that liver atrophy, 
precancerous lesions, repeated cholangitis, and jaundice 
for ≥1 week during the follow-up period were risk 
factors by univariate analysis and that liver atrophy and 
precancerous lesions were independent risk factors for 
hepatolithiasis-related death (cholangiocarcinoma and 
secondary biliary cirrhosis) by multivariate analysis. 
Furthermore, liver atrophy and precancerous lesions were 
also risk factors for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma by 
univariate analysis.
The development of cholangiocarcinoma in patients 
with hepatolithiasis is a critical issue. Although the 
observation period has varied among the studies 
published to date, the reported incidence rates of 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after any treatments 
are 4.8% (11/227 patients) (Cheon et al., 2009), 6.8% 
(16/236 patients) (Kim et al., 2015b), and 6.9% (27/392 
patients) (Suzuki et al., 2018). Furthermore, the reported 
incidence rates of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after 
liver resection are 4% (3/77 patients during a median 
8-year follow-up period) (Cheon et al., 2009), and 6.3% 
(6/95 patients during a median 41-month follow-up 
period) (Kim et al., 2015b). In the present study, 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma developed in 5 of the 62 
patients (8.1%). The slightly higher rate of subsequent 
cholangiocarcinoma after treatment for hepatolithiasis 
might be related to the long-term observation period in 
the present study.
Several studies have previously reported old age, bile 
duct stenosis, bilioenteric anastomosis, stone recurrence, 
stones in both hepatic lobes, and no liver resection as 
risk factors for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after 
treatment (Li et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2012; Kim et 
al., 2015b; Suzuki et al., 2018). In the present study, 
liver atrophy and precancerous lesions, which have not 
been evaluated in previous studies, were significant risk 
factors for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after treatment 
for hepatolithiasis. Repeated cholangitis and chronic 
inflammation of the biliary epithelium have been reported 
to lead to precancerous or early cancerous lesions, with 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma in a multistep fashion 
(Nakanuma et al., 2009). Itatsu et al., (2007) showed that 
BilIN was observed in 36 of 55 patients with hepatolithiasis 
without cholangiocarcinoma and in 9 of 19 patients with 
hepatolithiasis and concomitant cholangiocarcinoma; the 
authors also reported that IPNB was observed in 9 of the 
55 patients and 10 of the 19 patients. In the present study 
including 62 patients, BilIN and IPNB were found in 28 
and 1 patient, respectively. Importantly, all five patients 
with subsequent cholangiocarcinoma exhibited these

precancerous lesions.
The positive expression of γ-H2AX, the phosphorylated 
form of a histone 2A variant which indicates the presence 
of DNA double-stranded breaks, i.e., DNA injury, is 
observed in various cancers (Bartkova et al., 2005). 
The positive expression of γ-H2AX was previously 
reported in precancerous lesions such as BilIN as well 
as cholangiocarcinoma in patients with hepatolithiasis 
and occupational cholangiocarcinoma (Kinoshita et 
al., 2016). S100P, a member of the S100 family, has 
been shown to mediate malignant transformation and 
progression (Jiang et al., 2012). Previous studies have 
shown that S100P is expressed in cholangiocarcinoma 
and BilIN lesions in patients with hepatolithiasis (Sato et 
al., 2013). In this study, immunohistochemical evaluation 
revealed the presence of γ-H2AX and S100P in 18 and 
14 of the 28 BilIN lesions, respectively. Furthermore, 
γ-H2AX and S100P expressions were detected in all BilIN 
lesions in patients with subsequent cholangiocarcinoma. 
On the other hand, patients without γ-H2AX or S100P 
expressions did not develop postoperative carcinogenesis. 
These results suggested that chronic inflammation might 
have led to DNA injury and malignant transformation 
of the bile duct epithelium. In the present study, the 
relationship between precancerous lesions and liver 
atrophy was unclear although both were risk factors for 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma. For the development of 
cholangiocarcinoma, DNA injury and the abovementioned 
genetic alternations might be necessary in addition to 
liver atrophy.
In the present study, cholangiocarcinoma was 
detected between 2 years 3 months and 18 years after 
the liver resection in five patients. The site of the 
cholangiocarcinoma was adjacent to the margin of the 
resected bile duct in all patients. Kusano et al., (2001) 
reported that subsequent cholangiocarcinoma after 
liver resection for hepatolithiasis occurred within the 
same hepatic lobe where treatment was performed in 
most of the cases. Nakanuma et al., (2003) reported 
that chronic inflammatory conditions played a role in 
the development of cholangiocarcinoma arising from 
the bile duct exhibiting chronic inflammatory changes. 
The presence of precancerous lesions suggest that 
precancerous or early cancerous changes might develop 
in the adjacent bile duct. It could be speculated that the 
chronic inflammatory conditions in the resected bile 
ducts had spread to the adjacent nonatrophic bile ducts 
and that these inflammations had induced precancerous 
lesions or carcinogenesis in the bile ducts in the adjacent 
segments. In bile ducts not adjacent to the stump, the risk 
of carcinogenesis might be low because inflammation had 
not spread to the segments away from the surgical stump.
Our study indicates that close follow-up for an 
extended time period to assess for the development 
of cholangiocarcinoma is necessary to detect 
cholangiocarcinoma at an early stage. In the cases 
of other cholangiocarcinoma risk factors such as 
occupational cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, a combination of the measurement of serum 
concentrations of CA 19-9 and imaging examinations 
(ultrasonography or MRI) at 6- or 12-month intervals is 
recommended (Razumilava et al., 2011; Kubo et al., 2016). 
We suggest that follow-up observations after operation 
for hepatolithiasis with risk factors should be performed 
using the same methods as followed for these diseases. 
Because postoperative liver evaluation is difficult using 
ultrasonography, it would be better to perform imaging 
examinations via CT or MRI. In our study, patients after 
operation for hepatolithiasis were examined every 6 
months for several years and every 12 months thereafter. 
Subsequent cholangiocarcinoma can develop more 
than 10 years after operation; hence, we recommend 
continuing the follow-up every 6 months. Although the 
subsequent cholangiocarcinoma developed adjacent to the 
stump of the resected bile duct in the present study, the 
necessity of extended surgical treatment for patients with 
hepatolithiasis and associated precancerous lesions but 
not for those with invasive carcinoma remains unknown.
Liver atrophy, which was reported as a prognostic factor 
of cholangiocarcinoma associated with hepatolithiasis, 
was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor 
in the present study (Kubo et al., 1995; Suzuki et al., 
2012). Liver atrophy is related to repeated cholangitis 
because chronic inflammation causes portal stenosis or 
obstruction. Resection of the atrophied liver tissue is 
recommended because liver atrophy is also a risk factor 
for cholangiocarcinoma.
In the present study, 3 of the 62 patients (4.8%) died of 
secondary biliary cirrhosis due to repeated cholangitis after 
liver resection for hepatolithiasis. Chronic cholestasis, 
repeated cholangitis, and bile duct stricture lead to biliary 
cirrhosis (Suzuki et al., 2018). In fact, all three patients in 
the present study had repeated cholangitis due to residual 
stones and residual bile duct stricture.
The limitation of the present study was the small 
number of subjects and the single-hospital setting. For 
definitive conclusions, multicenter studies with larger 
number of subjects are warranted.
In conclusion, liver atrophy and precancerous 
lesions with malignant transformation were risk factors 
not only for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma but also 
for hepatolithiasis-related death after liver resection 
for hepatolithiasis. Therefore, long-term follow-up is 
necessary even after liver resection in patients with 
hepatolithiasis harboring these risk factors.
