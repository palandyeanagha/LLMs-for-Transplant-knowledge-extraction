ABSTRACT
Objective Myocardial fibrosis identified by late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR) in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with adverse
cardiovascular events, but its value as an independent
risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unknown.
We investigated the role of LGE-CMR in the risk
stratification of HCM.
Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in
a tertiary referral centre. Consecutive patients with HCM
(n=711, median age 56.3 years, IQR 46.7–66.6; 70.0%
male) underwent LGE-CMR and were followed for a
median 3.5 years. The primary end point was SCD or
aborted SCD.
Results Overall, 471 patients (66.2%) had myocardial
fibrosis (median 5.9% of left ventricular mass, IQR:
2.2–13.3). Twenty-two (3.1%) reached the primary end
point. The extent but not the presence of fibrosis was a
significant univariable predictor of the primary end point
(HR per 5% LGE: 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45; p=0.007
and HR for LGE: 2.69, 95% CI 0.91 to 7.97; p=0.073,
respectively). However, on multivariable analysis, only
LV-EF remained statistically significant (HR: 0.92, 95%
CI 0.89 to 0.95; p<0.001). For the secondary outcome
of cardiovascular mortality/aborted SCD, the presence
and the amount of fibrosis were significant predictors on
univariable but not multivariable analysis after adjusting
for LV-EF and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Conclusions The amount of myocardial fibrosis was
a strong univariable predictor of SCD risk. However,
this effect was not maintained after adjusting for LV-EF.
Further work is required to elucidate the interrelationship
between fibrosis and traditional predictors of outcome in
HCM.
INTRODUCTION
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common
myocardial disorder that in a minority of patients is
associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD).1 Data
from observational studies suggest that implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy effectively
prevents SCD,2 but also shows that the majority of
ICD recipients do not receive appropriate therapies
and have a high incidence of device-related compli￾cations.3 There is, therefore, a need to improve the
identification of patients at risk. Current approaches
to risk stratification rely on the assessment of a small
number of clinical features that have been shown in
observational cohort studies to associate with a
greater risk of SCD.4 In aggregate, these clinical risk
markers are associated with a substantially increased
incidence of SCD in long-term studies, but are
poorly predictive when they occur in isolation.4–6
Myocardial fibrosis has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of SCD in HCM.1 7 There has there￾fore been considerable interest in the use of late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) to detect and quantify
myocardial fibrosis in vivo.8 9 Initial prospective
cohort studies with short-term follow-up and there￾fore low event rates have suggested that the presence
and amount of fibrosis as detected by LGE-CMR is
of potential prognostic importance.9 10 These
studies focused on surrogate end points,8 11 and
despite the use of broad composite outcome mea￾sures, were inadequately powered to address SCD
risk or to adjust for the impact of confounding vari￾ables.12–15 Thus, the role of LGE-CMR in the risk
stratification of HCM for SCD and cardiovascular
mortality remains unresolved.9 10 16 We therefore
sought to determine the independent prognostic sig￾nificance of myocardial fibrosis in a large consecu￾tive HCM cohort with long-term follow-up.
METHODS
Study population
From September 2000 to June 2011, 815 consecu￾tive patients with HCM referred for CMR at Royal
Brompton Hospital were considered for enrolment.
Reasons for referral included diagnostic evaluation,
confirmation of diagnosis, family screening and
assessment of disease severity. HCM was diagnosed
in accordance with standard clinical guidelines.17
Patients were excluded if they had previous myect￾omy or alcohol septal ablation (n=21); previous
myocardial infarction (n=14); or contraindications
to CMR and gadolinium-based contrast agents
(n=12). Eight patients withdrew consent for study
participation and 49 were lost to follow-up, result￾ing in a final study cohort of 711 patients. The study
was performed in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by the National
Editor’s choice

from all patients.
Image acquisition
Images were acquired using 1.5 T scanners (Avanto/Sonata,
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with full myocardial coverage.
Balanced steady-state free-precession sequences were used to
obtain breath-hold cine images in three long-axis planes, fol￾lowed by a contiguous stack of short-axis slices from the atrio￾ventricular ring to the apex.18 Late enhancement images were
acquired ∼10 min after the administration of 0.1 mmol/kg intra￾venous gadolinium contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine/
gadobutrol, Bayer, Berlin, Germany) with an inversion recovery￾prepared gradient-echo sequence.19 Inversion times were opti￾mised to null normal myocardium with images acquired in two
orthogonal phase-encoding directions to exclude artefact.
Image analysis
LV volumes, function, mass and EF were measured using a semiau￾tomated threshold-based technique (CMRtools, Cardiovascular
Imaging Solutions, London, UK). All volume and mass measure￾ments were indexed to body surface area. Late enhancement was
defined as an area of high signal intensity on a background of
adequately nulled myocardium present in two orthogonal
phase-encoding directions. The amount of LGE was quantified
from a short-axis stack of images with dedicated software using
the full-width at half-maximum method (CMR42, Circle
Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Canada).12 20 21 This was
expressed as present or absent, and its amount was quantified as a
percentage of LV mass as previously described.15 22 23
Definition of outcome events and follow-up
All events were adjudicated by the consensus of an independent
end point committee blinded to the CMR results. The primary
end point was SCD or aborted SCD. The secondary end points
were: a composite of cardiovascular mortality (defined as death
due to heart failure, SCD, or non-haemorrhagic stroke), aborted
SCD or cardiac transplantation; and all-cause mortality.
SCD was defined as unexpected death either within 1 h of
cardiac symptoms in the absence of progressive cardiac deterior￾ation; during sleep; or within 24 h of last being seen alive.24
Heart failure death was defined as death associated with
unstable progressive deterioration of pump function despite
active therapy. Aborted SCD was diagnosed in patients who
received an appropriate ICD discharge for ventricular arrhyth￾mia or had a non-fatal episode of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or
spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (>30 s in
duration) causing haemodynamic compromise and/or requiring
cardioversion.
Survival status was determined through the UK National
Strategic Tracing Service. The date and cause of death were
determined using a combination of death certificates; post￾mortem data when available; communication with patients’
primary care physicians and cardiologists; and hospital records.
All patients were evaluated for non-fatal events using a standar￾dised telephone and/or postal questionnaire. The patients’
primary care physicians and cardiologists were contacted to
verify questionnaires and to obtain details of potential aborted
SCD events, including the results of relevant ICD
interrogations.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD for normally
distributed variables and as medians with IQR for non￾parametric data. Differences between parametric continuous
variables were assessed using Student t tests, and for non￾parametric data, the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data are
presented as frequencies and percentages, with differences
assessed using the χ2 and Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. The
start of follow-up was defined as the date of initial CMR evalu￾ation. Patients were censored at the time of their last clinical
follow-up. For composite end points, only the first event in each
patient was considered for analysis. Univariable cumulative sur￾vival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method
with a log-rank test to assess the significance of any difference
between groups. To adjust for potential confounders, multivari￾able Cox proportional hazards modelling was carried out using
covariates identified as significant on univariable analysis or
based on previous clinical experience or models. Survival
models were assessed for collinearity; interactions between cov￾ariates; and to ensure validity of the proportional hazards
assumption. The number of covariates examined was restricted
to maintain ≥10 events per degree of freedom. Two-tailed
values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata SE V.12.0
(StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
RESULTS
Study population
The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the
study population are summarised in table 1. The median dur￾ation of follow-up was 3.5 years (IQR: 2.1 years to 5.6 years)
amounting to 2852 patient-years of follow-up. The median age
at study entry was 56.3 years. The majority of patients were
male (70.0%) and minimally symptomatic (92.7% New York
Heart Association (NYHA) class I/II). Patients with fibrosis were
more likely to have extreme hypertrophy (LV wall thickness
≥30 mm) and non-sustained VT at baseline, giving rise to a
greater proportion with two or more risk factors for SCD.
CMR findings
Patients with fibrosis had more severe hypertrophy compared
with those without fibrosis exhibiting significantly higher
maximum LV wall thickness and indexed LV mass (table 2). At
baseline, LV-EF was significantly lower in those with fibrosis
than those without.
Figure 1 illustrates some representative examples of patterns
and severity of fibrosis seen in the study cohort. Two-thirds of
the cohort exhibited LGE (66.2%) with a median amount of
5.9% of LV mass (IQR: 2.2 to 13.3). A maximum end-diastolic
wall thickness of ≥19 mm was found on receiver operator char￾acteristic analysis to optimally predict the presence of LGE with
a sensitivity of 65.0%, specificity of 77.5% and Harrell’s c￾statistic of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.75). The positive and nega￾tive predictive values were 85.0% and 53.0%, respectively, in
our cohort. For patients with LV-EF ≤55%, the median amount
of LGE was 8.0% of LV mass (IQR 2.9 to 31.4).
Primary outcome
During follow-up, 22 (3.1%) of the 711 patients reached the
primary outcome measure of SCD or aborted SCD (table 3).
Overall, 18 (3.8%) patients in the fibrosis group versus 4 (1.7%)
in the no fibrosis group reached the primary outcome (HR
LGE: 2.69, 95% CI 0.91 to 7.97, p=0.073) (figure 2). On uni￾variable analysis, the amount of fibrosis was a significant pre￾dictor of outcome (HR per 5% LGE 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to
1.45, p=0.007). A previous history of sustained VT/VF (HR:
7.76, 95% CI 1.79 to 33.57; p=0.006), and LV-EF (HR: 0.92,

95% CI 0.89 to 0.95; p<0.001) were also statistically significant
on univariable analysis (table 4). However, on multivariable ana￾lysis, only LV-EF emerged as an independent predictor (table 4,
figure 3). Increasing amounts of fibrosis were associated with
increased risk (figure 4) but this relationship did not hold after
adjusting for LV-EF (table 4).
Secondary outcomes
In total, 38 (5.3%) of the 711 patients reached the principal sec￾ondary composite outcome measure of cardiovascular death (25
(3.5%)) or aborted SCD (13 (1.8%)). Of the 25 cardiovascular
deaths, 14 (56%) were due to heart failure, 9 (36%) to SCD and
2 (8%) to thromboembolic stroke (table 3). In the fibrosis group,
30 (6.4%) patients versus 8 (3.3%) in the no fibrosis group
reached this outcome (HR for LGE: 2.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.89;
p=0.043) (figure 2). Univariable analysis revealed that the
amount of fibrosis was also a significant predictor (HR per 5%
LGE: 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.41; p<0.001) together with LV-EF
(figure 4), and non-sustained VT (see online supplementary table
S1). However, after adjusting for the effects of LV-EF and non￾sustained VT, neither the presence nor the amount of fibrosis
remained statistically significant (see online supplementary
table S1).
During follow-up, 55 (7.7%) of the 711 patients reached the
secondary end point of all-cause mortality. Of the 55 deaths, 25
(45.5%) were due to cardiovascular causes. In contrast to the
cardiovascular mortality composite, neither the presence nor
the amount of fibrosis were significant univariable predictors
(see online supplementary table S2, figure 2). After adjusting for
the effects of LV-EF, NYHA class and previous sustained VT/VF,
the amount of fibrosis again failed to reach statistical significance
(see online supplementary table S2). LV-EF was the most signifi￾cant independent predictor of death from any cause (figure 3).
For heart failure mortality, there were too few events to
permit valid multivariable Cox regression analysis. However, on
exploratory univariable analysis (table 3), similar to the primary
and all-cause mortality end points, the amount but not the

presence of fibrosis was a significant univariable predictor of
outcome (HR per 5% LGE: 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.48;

DISCUSSION
The pressing need to improve risk stratification in HCM has
driven the search for better biomarkers that interrogate the
underlying substrate responsible for heart failure and SCD.4
Myocardial fibrosis can be assessed non-invasively using
LGE-CMR and is thought to play a key role in
arrhythmogenesis and the development of contractile dysfunc￾tion, providing a strong pathophysiological rationale for evaluat￾ing it as a biomarker of risk in HCM.9 In the present study,
CMR evidence of fibrosis was identified in two-thirds of
patients and the amount was an important predictor of SCD or
aborted SCD risk but did not provide independent prognostic
information incremental to LV-EF. Similar results were obtained
with respect to the principal secondary composite end point of
cardiovascular mortality or aborted SCD.
The present findings add substantially to our earlier work,
and two other previous smaller studies that have examined the
prognostic utility of LGE-CMR in HCM.12–14 We previously
found that the presence and the amount of fibrosis predicted
adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 217 patients with HCM.12

incorporated unplanned cardiovascular hospitalisation which
differed significantly between patients with and without fibrosis.
Furthermore, there were only nine cardiovascular deaths and we
were therefore not sufficiently powered to identify a difference
in either cardiovascular mortality or SCD between the two
groups. In the present much larger study with longer follow-up,
there were 22 SCDs or aborted SCDs and 38 cardiovascular
deaths or aborted SCDs in total, allowing us to make more
robust inferences on the prognostic value of fibrosis.
Bruder et al13 conducted the only other published prospective
LGE-CMR study to date using cardiovascular mortality as an end
point. They were able to demonstrate that fibrosis was a statistic￾ally significant univariable predictor of outcome, but with only a
total of 16 events, similar to our own previous work, their study
was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate the independent
prognostic significance of fibrosis with respect to SCD or cardio￾vascular mortality over and above potential confounders.9 In par￾ticular, as in the present study, fibrosis was highly associated with
significant hypertrophy, defined in terms of maximal LV wall
thickness and indexed LV mass. There was also a significant
excess of patients with non-sustained VT in their fibrosis group
relative to those without fibrosis. The latter association has also
been noted in numerous earlier studies.8 11 12 15 22 23
In the only other published prospective LGE-CMR study,
Maron et al14 evaluated the clinical significance of fibrosis in 202
patients with HCM using a composite primary end point of car￾diovascular death or progressive heart failure, which was defined
as a change in NYHA class. Despite the use of this broad end
point, and the inclusion of antitachycardia pacing as a
SCD-equivalent, only 11 adverse cardiovascular events occurred
over a mean follow-up of 1.9 years. Their event rate was therefore
insufficient to identify either the presence or the amount of fibrosis
as even an univariable predictor of outcome.9 However, in
keeping with the present study, a statistically significant inverse
association was found between LV systolic function as measured
by LV-EF and the presence and amount of fibrosis.14 The latter
finding is also in accordance with the results of Rubinshtein
et al.
15 Their retrospective cohort study also identified the pres￾ence of fibrosis as a significant univariable predictor of SCD or
appropriate ICD discharge. However, as only eight events
occurred among their 424 patients after a mean of 3.6 years
follow-up, in common with previous studies,13 14 they were
underpowered to adjust for statistically significant differences in
baseline characteristics between those with and without fibrosis.15
In the present study, LV-EF emerged as the most powerful inde￾pendent predictor of SCD risk as well as cardiovascular and all￾cause mortality. Although widely used to guide the management
of patients with ischaemic heart disease and non-ischaemic
dilated cardiomyopathy,25 26 the assessment of LV systolic func￾tion is not currently emphasised in guidelines for the risk stratifi￾cation of HCM.17 In the largest series to date, Harris et al
examined the prevalence and significance of adverse LV remodel￾ling in HCM.27 Of their retrospectively identified cohort of
1259 consecutive patients with HCM, 44 (3.5%) had evidence
of LV systolic dysfunction defined by echocardiography as
LV-EF<50% at rest. In our cohort, the prevalence of LV dysfunc￾tion defined using an equivalent CMR threshold of LV-EF≤55%
was similar in 23 (3.2%) of 711 patients. However, of these, 5
(21.7%) reached the primary end point of SCD or aborted SCD,
and 9 (39.1%) reached the principal secondary cardiovascular
composite outcome in comparison with two-thirds of patients in
the Harris cohort, although their higher incidence of adverse car￾diovascular events may reflect their longer follow-up duration.
Of note, 9 (81%) of a subgroup of 11 of their end-stage patients
had evidence of extensive fibrosis on CMR or at autopsy. In the
present study, 21 of 23 patients (91%) with LV dysfunction had
CMR evidence of fibrosis. The superior predictive value of
LV-EF over and above fibrosis may reflect the fact that it provides
a better synthesis of the various ventricular effects of HCM,

which include fibrosis and genetically mediated contractile dys￾function and energetic abnormalities.28
Although the poor prognosis of end-stage or incipient end-stage
disease is recognised, LV dysfunction is not sufficiently
emphasised in current clinical guidelines for risk stratification.17 29
As a consequence of LV hypertrophy, LV end-diastolic volumes
tend to be small in HCM, resulting in large fractional volume
changes in systole. Thus, even an apparently borderline EF may
be a harbinger of incipient adverse outcomes analogous to the
situation of LV volume overload due to chronic mitral
regurgitation.
Limitations
Our study was conducted at a single tertiary centre. While this
facilitated the use of a standardised scanning and follow-up
protocol, it also incurred the possibility of selection bias.
However, referrals to our centre are drawn from an extensive
network of district general hospitals spanning the entire south￾east and the wider UK, mitigating against this possibility.
Although the event rates observed in the present study were
considerably higher than those found in community-based
cohorts,1 30 they are comparable with those seen in other
studies of patients who have come to clinical attention.13–15
Our data are therefore representative of patients encountered by
cardiologists in clinical practice. Indeed, high-risk patients may
have been inadvertently selected out from our cohort. For
instance, those with an ICD at baseline were necessarily
excluded as this represents a contraindication to CMR.
Similarly, patients with previous gradient reduction therapy
were also excluded as this introduces confounding iatrogenic
scar, potentially lowering the event rate observed.
The amount of LGE was a statistically significant univariate
predictor of the primary and principal secondary end points.
This implies by definition that our study was adequately
powered to detect a statistically significant difference in
outcome based on the amount of LGE. However, on limited
further modelling, the amount of LGE did not emerge as an
independent risk factor incremental to other factors. While we
cannot exclude the possibility that a significantly larger sample
size and/or longer duration of follow-up would be able to tease
out a separate independent effect, we believe that this implies
that the effect size that we would be trying to detect is very
small and therefore the positive predictive value of the amount
of LGE over and above existing markers is likely to be very
limited.
Although 49 patients were lost to follow-up, we can confirm
from death certificate records that none of them died within the
UK. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that these
patients may have emigrated overseas or while within the UK,
received an ICD which was then subsequently liable to dis￾charge. However, generously assuming a device implantation
rate of 10%, only ∼five patients would have received an ICD.
With an annual discharge rate for primary prevention of 3.6%
per annum with a cumulative 5-year probability of 17%,2 only
∼one patient is likely to have received an appropriate shock
over 5 years (our median follow-up was 3.5 years). Therefore, it
is unlikely that statistically significant events were not captured
that would have altered our data interpretation. Furthermore,
among the 49 patients lost to follow-up, 24 (49.0%) had no
fibrosis versus 240 (33.8%) of the 711 patients with full
follow-up (p=0.0426). Thus, significantly more patients
without LGE were lost to follow-up, making it even more
unlikely that undetected events would have altered our
assessment.
Finally, the LGE-CMR technique exploits relative differences
in signal intensity between fibrotic and ostensibly normal myo￾cardium. The full-width at half-maximum technique has been
shown to be the most reproducible quantification method.20

Key messages
What is known on this subject?
Multiple small retrospective and prospective cohort studies using
composite outcome measures have suggested that the presence
and amount of myocardial fibrosis, as detected by late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE)-cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR), are associated with adverse outcomes in
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, none of these
studies were of sufficient size and/or duration to be able to
address the prognostic significance of myocardial fibrosis with
respect to sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, leaving the role of
LGE-CMR in HCM risk stratification unresolved.
What might this study add?
This is the first study to definitively confirm an association between
the amount of fibrosis, but not its mere presence, and SCD risk.
However, after adjusting for other factors such as LV-EF, the
amount of fibrosis did not retain independent significance.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
The amount of myocardial fibrosis is an important predictor of
SCD risk in HCM, but may not provide information incremental
to other factors. In contrast, LV dysfunction emerged as an
independent risk factor and should be given greater emphasis in
clinical guidelines as a harbinger of increased SCD risk.

CONCLUSIONS
The amount of myocardial fibrosis is an important predictor of
outcome in HCM but may not provide information incremental
to LV-EF. The latter is an important prognosticator for outcome
in HCM, which is underemphasised in current guidelines.
Further work is required to elucidate the interrelationship
between myocardial fibrosis and other markers of risk in HCM.
