Abstract
Our objective was to determine the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF, as well as the total 
and differential cell counts, in the pleural fluid of lung transplant recipients, correlating those levels with the 
occurrence and severity of rejection. We analyzed pleural fluid samples collected from 18 patients at various 
time points (up to postoperative day 4). The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF tended to elevate in parallel with 
increases in the severity of rejection. Our results suggest that these levels are markers of acute graft rejection 
in lung transplant recipients. 
Keywords: Lung transplantation; Pleural effusion; Cytokines; Graft rejection. 
Resumo
Nosso objetivo foi determinar os níveis de desidrogenase lática, IL-6. IL-8 e VEGF, assim como a contagem 
total e diferencial de células no líquido pleural de transplantados de pulmão, correlacionando esses níveis com 
a ocorrência e a gravidade de rejeição após o procedimento. Foram analisadas amostras de líquido pleural 
coletadas de 18 pacientes em diferentes momentos (até o quarto dia pós-operatório). Os níveis de IL-6, IL-8 
e VEGF apresentaram uma tendência de aumento paralelamente à gravidade de rejeição. Nossos resultados 
sugerem que esses níveis são indicadores de rejeição aguda do enxerto em transplantados de pulmão.
Descritores: Transplante de pulmão; Derrame pleural; Citocinas; Rejeição de enxerto.

Lung transplantation (LT) is a therapeutic 
option for patients with advanced lung disease. 
Despite advances in the treatment of lung 
transplant recipients, acute graft rejection remains 
common, affecting up to 55% of all such patients 
in the first postoperative year. Rejection is the major 
risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 
and appears to be related to a humoral response 
with complement activation and production of 
donor-specific HLA antibodies.(1) Transbronchial 
biopsy (TBB) is the primary method for diagnosing 
acute cellular rejection. Several studies have 
shown a correlation between elevated serum 
cytokine levels and postoperative complications, 
as well as an association of serum cytokine levels 
with reperfusion edema, acute rejection, and 
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.(2) The objective 
of the present study was to determine whether 
acute cellular rejection correlates with lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, proinflammatory 
cytokine levels, and differential cell counts in 
the pleural fluid of lung transplant recipients. 
We hypothesized that elevated levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines in the pleural fluid 
of lung transplant recipients are early indicators 
of graft rejection. 
Between August of 2006 and March of 2008, 
20 lung transplant recipients were evaluated for 
inclusion in the present study, 18 being included. 
Two patients were excluded from the analysis 
because they died within the first 6 weeks. The 
overall LDH levels, overall cytokine levels, and cell 
counts in pleural fluid were reported elsewhere, 
without any reference to rejection.(3)

Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were undetectable 
in all samples. Serum VEGF levels were much 
lower than pleural fluid VEGF levels and were 
not significantly different among subgroups A0, 
A1, A2, and A3. 
In the present study, undetectable serum 
cytokine levels suggest that the inflammatory 
response in lung transplant recipients is primarily 
confined to the lungs and pleural cavity. Similar 
results have been reported elsewhere,(2,4,5) acute 
elevation of serum cytokine levels having been 
found to be more evident in patients with 
reperfusion edema or acute rejection. 
The correlation between LDH levels and 
differential cell counts in pleural fluid is shown 
in Table 1, having been found to be higher in 
the subgroups of patients with graft rejection. 
We found elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in 
the pleural fluid samples collected 6 h after LT, 
those levels having decreased by postoperative 
day 4. No such variation was observed in VEGF 
Blood and pleural fluid samples were collected 
6 h after surgery and daily until postoperative day 
4. A TBB was performed at 2 and 6 weeks after 
LT in order to evaluate the severity of rejection, 
which was classified according to the intensity of 
perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration in the 
lung parenchyma, as follows: A0, no rejection; 
A1, minimal rejection; A2, mild rejection; A3, 
moderate rejection; and A4, severe rejection. 
For the final analysis, the highest degree of 
rejection was selected. 
No TBB samples underwent blind analysis. 
All TBB procedures were performed by a trained 
pathologist as routinely done at our facility. At 
least 5 tissue samples were analyzed in order to 
ensure that the lung parenchyma was adequately 
represented. 
In 3, 4, 8, and 3 of the 18 patients studied, 
the severity of rejection was classified as A0, 
A1, A2, and A3, respectively.

Cytokine levels in pleural fluid as markers of acute rejection after lung transplantation

of IL-6 and IL-8. The cytokine levels found in 
the patients in whom the severity of rejection 
was classified as A3 were much higher than 
were those found in the remaining subgroups 
of patients, and this might be an early indicator 
of rejection. 
Pleural fluid levels of IL-6 correlated positively 
with LDH levels (r = 0.49; p = 0.030) and the 
neutrophil count (r = 0.90; p = 0.036), and 
VEGF levels were strongly correlated with the 
neutrophil count (r = 0.91; p = 0.030) and the 
total leukocyte count (r = 0.88; p = 0.048). 
In contrast, a strong negative correlation was 
found between IL-8 levels and the lymphocyte 
count (r = −0.97; p = 0.007). In addition, a 
strong positive correlation was found between 
IL-6 levels and IL-8 levels (r = 0.70; p < 0.001), 
as well as between IL-6 levels and VEGF levels 
(r = 0.71; p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a 
slight correlation between IL-8 levels and VEGF 
levels (r = 0.49; p = 0.027). In the present study, 
there was no correlation between the severity 
of acute rejection and the severity of primary 
graft dysfunction within the first 72 h after LT. 
In lung transplant recipients, inflammation of 
the lung parenchyma leads to increased interstitial 
edema with increased cytokine levels. Because 
levels. Patients in whom graft rejection was 
more severe tended to have higher levels of 
those cytokines (Table 2). Patients in whom the 
severity of rejection was classified as A3 had higher 
levels of IL-6 and IL-8 at all time points when 
compared with those in whom graft rejection 
was less severe. In the samples collected 6 h 
after LT, VEGF levels were higher in the patients 
in whom the severity of rejection was classified 
as A3, A2, or A1 than in those in whom it was 
classified as A0. 
Inflammation of the pleural space is due to the 
surgical trauma and the presence of a chest tube 
and can explain the high levels of cytokines. In our 
study, it is of note that, although inflammatory 
marker levels progressively decreased over time, 
proinflammatory cytokine levels remained elevated 
during the first 4 days, and irritation caused by 
the chest tube left in place for up to 96 h can 
explain that, although it does not explain the 
differences among the subgroups of patients. We 
speculate that the cytokine levels found in the 
patients classified as A0 represent the increase 
in cytokine levels that occurs as a result of the 
surgical trauma and the use of chest tubes. This 
level of inflammation decreases over time, as 
evidenced by a reduction in pleural fluid levels

lymphatic vessels are cut, the amount of interstitial 
fluid leaving the lungs and going through the 
visceral pleura increases. This can lead to high 
cytokine levels, which have been observed in 
patients with graft rejection. 
One limitation of the present study was the 
small number of patients in each subgroup. 
However, it is clear that inflammatory cytokine 
levels were highest in the patients in whom the 
severity of rejection was classified as A3. The lack 
of a significant difference between subgroups A1 
and A2 regarding cytokine levels is possibly due 
to the small sample size. In addition, the fact 
that pleural fluid collection and TBB occurred 
at different time points possibly influenced the 
results. The data presented here are old, and a 
larger study, based on these data, is currently 
under way. 
The present study demonstrated that elevated 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the pleural 
fluid of lung transplant recipients can be markers 
of acute graft rejection (particularly of moderate 
to severe rejection). In this context, determination 
of cytokine levels in pleural fluid can be useful 
in identifying patients who will develop graft 
rejection. Therefore, treatment can be initiated 
sooner, thus reducing lung parenchymal injury.
