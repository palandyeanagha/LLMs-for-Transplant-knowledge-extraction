Abstract
Introduction: International evidence shows that enhancement of primary health care (PHC) services for
disadvantaged populations is essential to reducing health and health care inequities. However, little is known about
how to enhance equity at the organizational level within the PHC sector. Drawing on research conducted at two
PHC Centres in Canada whose explicit mandates are to provide services to marginalized populations, the purpose
of this paper is to discuss (a) the key dimensions of equity-oriented services to guide PHC organizations, and (b)
strategies for operationalizing equity-oriented PHC services, particularly for marginalized populations.
Methods: The PHC Centres are located in two cities within urban neighborhoods recognized as among the
poorest in Canada. Using a mixed methods ethnographic design, data were collected through intensive immersion
in the Centres, and included: (a) in-depth interviews with a total of 114 participants (73 patients; 41 staff), (b) over
900 hours of participant observation, and (c) an analysis of key organizational documents, which shed light on the
policy and funding environments.
Results: Through our analysis, we identified four key dimensions of equity-oriented PHC services:
inequity-responsive care; trauma- and violence-informed care; contextually-tailored care; and culturally-competent
care. The operationalization of these key dimensions are identified as 10 strategies that intersect to optimize the
effectiveness of PHC services, particularly through improvements in the quality of care, an improved 'fit' between
people's needs and services, enhanced trust and engagement by patients, and a shift from crisis-oriented care to
continuity of care. Using illustrative examples from the data, these strategies are discussed to illuminate their
relevance at three inter-related levels: organizational, clinical programming, and patient-provider interactions.
Conclusions: These evidence- and theoretically-informed key dimensions and strategies provide direction for PHC
organizations aiming to redress the increasing levels of health and health care inequities across population groups.
The findings provide a framework for conceptualizing and operationalizing the essential elements of
equity-oriented PHC services when working with marginalized populations, and will have broad application to a
wide range of settings, contexts and jurisdictions. Future research is needed to link these strategies to quantifiable
process and outcome measures, and to test their impact in diverse PHC settings.

Introduction
Despite Canada’s commitment to provide high quality
health care, health inequities remain a pressing concern.
Of particular concern are the persistent and growing
health and health care inequities affecting marginalized
populations [1-5]. In Canada, increasing homelessness;
social exclusion experienced by those living with
chronic mental illness or substance use; violence against
women; and systemic discrimination toward Aboriginal
peoplea and new immigrants are instances of systemic
health and social inequities that can be addressed
through equity-oriented primary health care (PHC)b
interventions, particularly when linked to structural
changes and policy shifts.
As reiterated by the World Health Organization
(WHO), one of the most efficient ways of ‘closing the
equityc gap’ within a population is to address the health
and health care needs of those most disadvantaged [6].
International evidence continues to show that enhance￾ment of PHC services for disadvantaged populations is
one of the most important means of reducing inequities
[7-9]. Repeated calls for PHC renewal are based on solid
evidence that a strong PHC foundation leads to improved
population health outcomes, including reduced risk and
effects of acute and chronic conditions; reduced use of
emergency services; lower rates of preventable hospital
admissions; and lower overall health care utilization
[6,7,10]. Conversely, when PHC is not accessible or effect￾ive, people delay seeking help, rely on emergency care,
and lose the benefits of continuity of care [3,11,12]. These
issues contribute to the increasing importance of the
PHC sector in enhancing efforts to orient services toward
marginalized populations where the greatest gains in
redressing inequities can be achieved [7,9,13,14]. Broad￾based PHC approaches and interventions – that integrate
accessible, high quality, responsive services with structural
and policy changes to improve people’s access to the so￾cial determinants of health – may therefore be one of the
most effective means of working towards greater equity.
In this article, the terms ‘marginalized,’ ‘vulnerable’ or
‘disadvantaged’ refer to the conditions and processes by
which particular populations are affected by structural in￾equities and structural violence in ways that result in a
disproportionate burden of ill health and social suffering.
We place an emphasis on marginalizing conditions to
suggest that particular populations are not inherently
marginalized, rather, it is the marginalizing conditions
that create and sustain inequities. Structural inequities
refer to how policies and practices embedded in systems
such as social welfare, economic, justice and health care
operate to produce inequitable distribution of the deter￾minants of health [15]. Structural violence is increasingly
seen in public and population health as a major determin￾ant of the distribution and outcomes of health inequities
and is defined as “a host of offensives against human dig￾nity: extreme and relative poverty, social inequalities ran￾ging from racism to gender inequality, and the more
spectacular forms of violence” [15] (p.8). Inequities are
structural because they are embedded in the political and
economic organizations of our social world, and they are
violent because they cause injury to people [15]. For ex￾ample, discrimination, individual and institutionalized ra￾cism, poverty, and social exclusion are consequences of
structural inequities and structural violence, and have
tangible effects on health status and access to health care
[3,16-20]. The health of Aboriginal people in Canada
serves as a case in point. Despite improvements in recent
years, inequities persist on virtually every measure of
health and social status, for example, lower life expect￾ancy, decreased access to health services, and dispropor￾tionately high rates of preventable, chronic and acute
health conditions [1,4,21,22].
Focusing on the health effects of inequities necessi￾tates attention to the concept of trauma. Trauma is in￾creasingly used to frame the health, social, and
psychological effects of structural inequities and struc￾tural violence [21,23-35]. Research shows that trauma
histories are highly prevalent among marginalized
populations [24]. Traumatizing experiences include, for
example, discrimination and social exclusion, poverty,
emotional abuse, physical violence, sexual assault, tor￾ture and war. Traumatizing experiences can be histo￾rical and intergenerational such as the experiences of
Aboriginal people in Canada. Despite mounting evi￾dence linking trauma with negative health effects (e.g.,
chronic pain, problematic substance use, mental health
issues) [25,32,36,37], little is known about how to ad￾dress trauma in the context of PHC service delivery to
marginalized populations.
Research on PHC delivery highlights several persistent
problems: (i) inverse care (i.e., those who are most mar￾ginalized and have the greatest health problems have the
least access to care); (ii) fragmentation and under￾resourcing of care for marginalized populations; (iii)
significant gaps in knowledge concerning how to make
services responsive to marginalized populations; and (iv)
policy and funding environments inadequate to redress
these problems [7]. Thus, despite a proliferation of calls
for strategies to enhance the ability of the PHC sector to
develop ‘equity-competence’, little is known about (a)
key dimensions of equity-oriented services that ought to
guide PHC organizations; or (b) the strategies, processes
and policies for enhancing the capacity to deliver equity￾oriented PHC services, particularly for marginalized
populations [7,38-40]. The purpose of this article is to
describe the key dimensions of PHC services, and the
strategies for operationalizing those dimensions when
equity is an explicit goal, and when working with

marginalized populations. Drawing on research at two
PHC Centres in Canada with explicit mandates to pro￾vide services to marginalized populations, we discuss the
relevance of these strategies for PHC agencies and orga￾nizations that aim to address the intersecting health and
social needs of people experiencing systemic inequities.
We begin with an overview of the study. We then out￾line key dimensions of equity-oriented PHC. Next, we
identify strategies for operationalizing these dimensions
at the patient-provider, organizational, and system levels.
Methods
Overview of study
The findings discussed in this article are part of a larger
four-year study aimed at (a) extending our understand￾ing of how PHC services are provided to meet the needs
of people who have been marginalized by systemic in￾equities, (b) identifying key dimensions of PHC services
for marginalized populations, and (c) developing PHC
indicators that can account for the quality, process, and
outcomes of care when marginalized populations are ex￾plicitly targeted. In this paper, we focus on the first two
objectives; an analysis of the work leading to the devel￾opment of PHC indicators has been reported elsewhere
[41]. Methodologically, this research is informed by crit￾ical perspectives of social justice and equity [42-46]. The
critical theories upon which we draw focus attention on
the development of practical knowledge that has the po￾tential to disrupt and transform inequitable social rela￾tions. A central methodological concern is that
individual experiences, including those in health care,
need to be interpreted and understood within the con￾text of broad social, political and historical relations.
Such interpretations are needed to better address sys￾temic inequities in health service delivery. These theor￾etical perspectives provided a framework that guided our
methodological approaches and analytical perspectives.
Approval to conduct this study was provided by two
university research ethics boards and by the PHC agen￾cies. Using a mixed methods ethnographic design, the
research was conducted at two urban PHC Centres in
western Canada whose explicit mandates are to provide
PHC services to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal popula￾tions experiencing major social and economic inequities.
Both have been in operation since the early 1990s, and
are located in the inner city areas of two cities recog￾nized as among the lowest socio-economic neighbour￾hoods in Canada.
The Centres’ combined patient population is 5,500; a
high proportion identify as Aboriginal people, and the
majority live in poverty and experience social exclusion,
racialization and discrimination on a daily basis. Many
suffer the consequences of colonization, including the
historical trauma of displacement, forced attendance at
residential schools, limited educational and employment
opportunities on reserves, the disruption of family and
communities, the eradication of language and culture,
and the ongoing trauma of race-based violence, and dis￾crimination (e.g., unemployment). Many of the patients
reside in single room occupancy hotels, have significant
mental health and substance use issues, and other stig￾matizing health conditions, including HIV/AIDS. Almost
all of the patients have experienced inter-related traumas
stemming from violence, childhood neglect or abuse, or
sexual exploitation. Many, however, reported a strong
sense of community connection and belongingness as
people residing in both inner city areas.
To respond to people’s intersecting health and social
needs, the services at each Centre are organized around
a PHC clinic staffed by physicians, nurses, nurse practi￾tioners, social workers, substance use counsellors, and
outreach workers, and include on-site and outreach pro￾grams. To different degrees, Indigenous approaches to
health and healing are integrated, such as the employ￾ment of Aboriginal Elders who provide counselling and
support to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients.
Data collection
The ethnographic approaches we used are typically under￾utilized in medical and health services research and, there￾fore, represent innovative qualitative approaches applied to
the study of health equity. Observational and interview data
were collected at the Centres primarily by the principal
investigators, who are experienced ethnographic research￾ers. In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 114
patients and staff, including: (a) individual interviews with
62 patients, and three focus groups with 11 patients
(n = 73 patients), and (b) individual interviews with 33 staff,
and an additional eight staff who participated in focus
groups (n = 41 staff ). An analysis of key organizational
documents was also completed to shed light on policy and
funding environments. In addition, in-depth interviews
were conducted with two decision-makers employed by
Health Authorities within which the Centres are located
and funded. Written and verbal consent was obtained prior
to conducting interviews or observations, and the voluntary
nature of participation was reiterated frequently.
The patient interviews were critical to conceptualizing
the approaches to care that were most important in the
context of people’s lives. Patient interviews focused on
their reasons for coming to the Centres, their likes and
dislikes about the services provided, their working rela￾tionships with staff, comparisons with health care
experiences elsewhere, and how services could be
improved to better meet their needs. Staff interviews fo￾cused on their experiences working at the Centres, those
aspects of service delivery that were essential to address
inequities, how they supported and facilitated access to
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 3 of 15

health and social services in ways that influenced
patients’ overall quality of life, and how continuity of
care was established with patients who might otherwise
‘fall through the cracks.’
Participant observation involved over 900 hours of in￾tensive immersion, which was essential to developing
knowledge about equity-oriented PHC services grounded
in the everyday complexities of clinical practice. Partici￾pant observation was conducted as unobtrusively as pos￾sible in the waiting rooms, at the reception desks, in team
meetings, and during clinical interactions between
patients and providers. The focus of observations was on:
(i) the general organizational milieu at the Centres (e.g.,
the use of spaces to create a welcoming environment,
staff approaches with patients in the waiting room, how
patients were greeted at the reception desk, how conflict
was dealt with, and the strategies used to prioritize
patients); and (ii) the staff members’ patterns of interact￾ing, relating, and working with patients and with one an￾other, including how they attended to patients, what they
paid attention to, and how the socio-economic or cultural
contexts of patients’ lives were taken into consideration.
Using purposeful sampling, patients were recruited to
reflect a diversity of ages, genders and positive and nega￾tive experiences with the Centres. Recruitment to partici￾pate in interviews also involved obtaining consent to
participate in observations. Several approaches were used
in recruitment: the waiting rooms contained posters and
flyers about the study, and interested patients were
invited to identify themselves to the reception staff, who
in turn notified the researchers; during the process of par￾ticipant observation, researchers informed patients about
the study and invited their subsequent involvement; lastly,
to invite the participation of diverse patients, staff and
patients identified individuals who were known to have
varied experiences with the Centres. Observational data
provided a context for discussing, clarifying and exploring
issues raised in interviews, and vice versa. Among the
patients who participated (n = 73), 52% were women,
45% were men, and 3% identified as transgender.
Seventy-seven percent self-identified as Aboriginal, 22%
as Euro-Canadian, and 1% as members of a visible minor￾ityd [47]. Ages ranged from 20 to 72 (mean = 45 years
old). Of the Centres’ staff who participated (n = 41), 24%
were nurses or nurse practitioners, 22% were physicians,
22% were medical office assistants (MOAs) and office
managers, 10% were in administrative leadership posi￾tions, 7% were social workers, 5% were substance use
counsellors, and 10% were other staff including an Elder,
an outreach worker, a support worker and a pharmacist.
Data analysis
An interpretive thematic analysis was conducted using
procedures for qualitatively derived data [48-50]. Interview
transcripts and observational notes were repeatedly read
by the members of the investigative team to identify recur￾ring and contradictory patterns in the data, and possible
linkages to theoretical perspectives. A qualitative computer
software package (NVivo, QSR International, 2010) was
used to organize and code the narrative data. The
researchers met regularly during the coding process to as￾sess inter-rater reliability, resolve discrepancies, and ensure
consistency. For example, as the code-book was being
developed, each interview was coded by at least two
experienced researchers. Discrepancies were discussed and
addressed as the concepts and themes reflected in the
codes were further refined.
As data were collected and analyzed, coding categories
were refined. In the final stages, the analysis shifted to a
more abstract and conceptual representation of themes
and the key dimensions of PHC. Importantly, observa￾tional data provided a means of triangulating interview
data, adding to the methodological rigour.
The credibility of our analysis, as a criterion for rigour
in qualitative research, was continually evaluated by
members of our research team, who included experts in
ethnographic research, PHC services and health equity,
and a community advisory committee comprised of
patients, and health care providers external to the Cen￾tres. Throughout, the research team held regular meet￾ings with groups of patients and staff to discuss the
analytical insights and themes. We used diverse strat￾egies including: co-hosting lunches with peer-support
workers, during which we invited patients to provide
feedback on the findings; engaging in outreach activities
such as community tours with patients and staff to gain
further insights; consulting with Aboriginal Elders to en￾sure their perspectives were taken into account; and
consulting frequently with the community advisory com￾mittee to seek their input. These stakeholders confirmed
that the identified themes reflected in the data resonated
with their experiences and interpretations, and that the
framework we proposed captured the essential features
of equity-oriented PHC. For example, at a lunch hosted
for ~ 25 patients, the patients completely took over the
discussion of the proposed strategies, emphasizing their
importance. One man commented, “I thought I was just
coming for lunch, but this was the best meeting ever.”
Throughout, an audit trail of analytical insights and
decisions was maintained.
Results and discussion
Through the analysis we identified (a) four key dimensions
of equity-oriented PHC services, which are particularly
relevant when working with marginalized populations, (b)
10 strategies to guide organizations to enhance their cap￾acity for equity-oriented services, and (c) outcomes related
to these dimensions and strategies (see Figure 1).

Conceptually, the four key dimensions provide a
framework for understanding the essential elements of
equity-oriented PHC services when working with mar￾ginalized populations. The dimensions are interrelated
and overlapping, and include:
 Inequity-Responsive Care: explicitly addressing the
social determinants of health as legitimate and routine
aspects of health care, often as the main priority.
 Trauma- and Violence-Informed Care: recognizing
that most people affected by systemic inequities and
structural violence have experienced, and often
continue to experience, varying forms of violence with
traumatic impact. Such care consists of respectful,
empowerment practices informed by understanding
the pervasiveness and effects of trauma and violence,
rather than ‘trauma treatment’ such as psychotherapy.
 Contextually-Tailored Care: expanding the concept
of patient-centred care to include services that are
explicitly tailored to the populations served and local
contexts. This may include organizational tailoring
to address the local population demographics and
social trends (e.g., programs or services addressing
HIV, seniors, women’s or men’s issues, support for
new immigrants, etc.).
 Culturally-Competent Care: taking into account not
only the cultural meaning of health and illness, but
equally importantly, people’s experiences of racism,
discrimination and marginalization and the ways
those experiences shape health, life opportunities,
access to health care, and quality of life.
The operationalization of these key dimensions is identi￾fied in this paper as strategies that intersect to optimize the
effectiveness of services, particularly through improvements
in the quality of care, an improved ‘fit’ between people’s
needs and services, enhanced trust and engagement by
patients, and a shift from crisis-oriented care to continuity
of care [37,41]. As shown in Figure 1, both patients and pro￾viders directly linked these specific strategies to short-term
outcomes such as an increase in patients’ capacities to man￾age their own health, and increased access to resources
essential to support health. Both also identified longer-term
improvements in health and quality of life, with the poten￾tial for reducing health inequities at the population level.
These 10 overlapping strategies are discussed below to
illustrate their relevance at three inter-related levels:
organizational, clinical programming, and patient-provider
interactions. These are proposed as principles of equity￾oriented services, recognizing that PHC organizations,
agencies and practices will have to tailor the extent to which
they can implement each strategy in their local context.

services that foster equity for vulnerable patients and popu￾lations is promoted. Key to positioning equity as an explicit
mandate is the articulation of related commitments in gov￾ernance, mission statements, and organizational-level policy
statements. This requires strong leadership within the
organization, and the continual reflection of mission state￾ments in job postings, staff orientations, staff performance
reviews, and related documents and activities. The activities
of the organizational leaders are important in reinforcing
the organization’s commitment to equity, including for ex￾ample, the kinds of advocacy and social justice or policy
work that leaders engage in within the wider community.
One of the Centres’ administrative leaders commented:
Trying to articulate what our mission and vision and
values are....I mean it’s a big piece of work. So you
don’t just ignore it once you’ve produced the
document. We agonized over those. So we darn well
better make sure it’s entrenched in what we do.
At the organizational level, hiring practices need to
ensure a match between staff and the organization
values, philosophy, and the approaches to care that rep￾resent the operationalization of the mission statement.
Declaring an organizational commitment to fostering
equity can contribute to solidifying an organization’s
identity and can serve to attract employees who share
similar values regarding PHC and social justice, as
noted by this physician: “it’s not a hidden agenda – it’s
right out there...it’s part of what you’re getting into.”
Working within a PHC organization distinguished by
an explicit, organizational commitment to equity can
represent a defining feature of practice for direct ser￾vice providers, as this staff member discussed:
I think to have it [a commitment to equity] as a shared
value is very central to what we do...That’s what’s
different, if you’ve ever worked anywhere where people
don’t really talk about these things, never mind work on
them and try to make it a central core.
At the level of direct clinical care, mission and vision
statements also provide a sense of perspective and pur￾pose when progress toward achieving improved health
for particular patient-groups is slow or ostensibly back￾sliding, as a provider explained:
It is easy to talk about the rhetoric [related to equity],
but when you’re here and the patient is, you know, it’s
the ninth time you’ve seen them in a month and
you’re not getting anywhere. She or he [the
organizational leader] is a person who can take you
back to the vision and can take you back to, you
know, how to see the bigger picture.
Commitments to equity, however, cannot be enacted and
will not be sustainable without supportive funding and
policy environments.
2. Develop and advocate for structures, policies, and
processes to support the enactment of equity
Funding and policy environments that are supportive of
equity-oriented aims are needed. This means that leaders
must develop appropriate structures, policies and processes
within their organizations and advocate within larger con￾texts for the conditions necessary to achieve these aims.
Within the Centres, leaders created an organizational cul￾ture that supported interdisciplinary team meetings and
the active participation of all team members in planning
care, programs, and case management. These activities
need to be supported by stable funding arrangements to
enhance the ability of the organization to enact a philo￾sophical commitment to equity, and by social policy that
enhances access to social determinants of health. Thus,
Centre leaders were active at local community, city, provin￾cial and federal levels advocating for adequate social hous￾ing, better access to income supports, and allocation of
health care funding within their own and other health care
organizations (to support, for example, methadone pro￾grams and other harm reduction activities).
Efforts to create conditions to support the enactment
of equity were also influenced by factors beyond the
Centres. For example, leaders negotiated for physicians
to be paid by salary rather than fee-for-service to enable
their participation beyond direct patient care in interdis￾ciplinary meetings and case conferences; however, such
meetings were constantly under threat due to fiscal pres￾sures and questions raised by funders about how clinical
staff were using time – pressures that varied with the de￾gree of independence each Centre had in relation to
their funding bodies. The Centres varied in the extent to
which their contractual funding arrangements permitted
them to enact the strategies of equity-oriented care. For
example, block-funding arrangements with longer terms
permitted greater flexibility at one Centre, whereas at
the other, year-to-year and fragmented funding and
chronic underfunding limited the range of services in
place to address the complexities associated with vio￾lence, poverty, homelessness, or substance use. Funding
is also needed to provide counselling or debriefing for
staff who are dealing with the vicarious effects of struc￾tural violence and trauma, as discussed further in strat￾egy eight. A manager explained:
[Our funders were]...micro managing...telling you
what your priorities were going to be...telling us
almost on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis what
you’re going to be doing with your time and those
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 6 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

kinds of things. We just kind of said, “No! No, that’s
not the way it works.” And to some extent that
worked. But they still control the purse strings and as
such they still have a lot of kind of ‘leverage over’ –
because they can always say, if you’re not going to
behave the way we want you to, we’ll find another
agency that will.
Importantly, funding arrangements varied in terms of
how professional time could be flexibly deployed, for in￾stance, for patient care, team meetings and collaborative
case management. Revisioning the use of time was a
critical strategy.
3. Revision use of time to meet the needs of client
populations
Time and its use are crucial considerations, in terms of
expectations regarding ‘how long’ it should take to see
health improvements, and how providers use time. Work￾ing with populations whose health is so closely linked with
social and economic conditions can seem slow or stagnant
with respect to improvements in short- and long-term out￾comes. Rather than constructing patients as ‘non￾compliant’ or as failing to achieve goals, the Centre’s
providers recognized how broader contexts influenced
people’s health trajectories and decisions. The collective
expertise of staff and interdisciplinary teams was used to
determine when to support or ‘push’ patients to go a step
further in moving toward their potential. This was
particularly evident in relation to substance use and
addictions issues, adhering to anti-retroviral treatments,
safe-guarding against interpersonal violence, or working
toward healthy parenting skills. Staff sought patient’s
input about goals, discerning the patients’ readiness and
supporting steps to prepare for change – a process
that required long-term strategies and commitment.
A patient described the impact of not “approaching
me too fast”:
What this place did for me was, actually, it really did
help me out. Because it gave me a sense of security, a
sense of trust with these people. And for me that’s a
hard thing to do, just to trust people. Especially
managers and staff members of any type....And staff
members don’t approach me too fast, too hard and too
quick, which is important, I believe. So, it’s, let me sort
of come to you. And because it’s hard for me to ask for
things...it’s hard for me to ask for help. So the staff
here are patient with that. And I think they understand
that, which is important.
Revisioning the use of time also refers to cultivating
health care relationships over time. Time is required for
participatory engagement of patients, and is fostered by
adopting clinic structures that encourage ‘patient activa￾tion’, such as patient-initiated appointments scheduled
on a drop-in or pre-booked basis. Such scheduling struc￾tures need to be creative, fluid, and innovative to accom￾modate people’s rapidly shifting priorities and concerns,
as this provider explained:
So someone might come in and you think that they
are going to be here for their ear infection. But then,
you get to know them on a broader level, so you can
say like, "how are things going at home?” And to
really be able to see people in an ongoing way, and
say like, "so where are you living now? And you know
and how’s it going?"... So then you can have the
opportunity and the time and the resources to address
those issues.
Revisioning time also means recognizing the com￾plexity of the work involved in providing PHC to mar￾ginalized populations. Organizationally, this required
recog nizing the need (and scheduling time) for inter￾disciplinary meetings; putting in place adequate time
and processes to support staff to provide care to people
who are highly traumatized; and providing flexibility in
scheduling so that patients with greater needs are
provided more time. This strategy in turn requires
collaborative decision-making.
4. Engage in decision-making on the basis of critical
analyses of power differentials, flattened hierarchies
within interdisciplinary teams, and shared leadership
approaches
To address the health effects of persistent power
inequities, stigma, everyday social exclusion, and
systemic discrimination experienced by many margina￾lized patients, organizations must first reflect critically,
and purposefully, on power relations within their
organization – in relation to interactions with patients,
staff, management, the wider community, and other
sectors and organizations. For service providers includ￾ing receptionists, professional staff, and management,
this requires critical self-reflection on how power differ￾entials are managed, particularly with patients who may
find it challenging to relate with or trust people in posi￾tions of authority [20,51]. A physician with years of
experience working at one of the Centres described this
process:
You’re trying to reflect on, you know, check my
attitude: was I being condescending? And I’m sure
many times I am, because you know, like, you slip
into that role right? You’re the doctor.
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 7 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

Another physician described the approach she takes to
engage in critical reflexivity:
You have to look at the privileges that you gained as a
consequence [of your professional status and social
location], and that’s very uncomfortable for people.
At the organizational level, attention must be paid to
power inequities that often shape staff dynamics. For ex￾ample, engaging in team meetings and sharing leader￾ship in ways that intentionally aim to flatten professional
hierarchies among staff are critical and prerequisite to
addressing power differentials in relation to patient
populations. Team meetings or case conferences can be
conducted in ways to signal all staff input is important –
including reception staff who often have the most fre￾quent contact with patients and play an influential role
in shaping access to services. Scheduling team meetings
at regular intervals also is essential to foster interdiscipli￾narity and comprehensiveness of services – and is crit￾ical to developing synergy among staff and within the
organization about how to maintain equity-oriented
strategies.
5. Tailor care, programs and services to the context of
people’s lives (e.g., cultural, social, gender, and
demographic contexts)
This strategy rests on the premise that PHC services
need to be meaningful to the patient-population
served. The notion of ‘tailoring’ builds on and extends
the notion of patient-centred care, and refers to the
adaptations that can occur when the social and cul￾tural contexts of local patient-populations are taken
into account in the process of delivering care. These
adaptations are significant when working with patient￾populations who, in the process of seeking health care,
often encounter dismissiveness, stereotyping and nega￾tive assumptions related to poverty, racism, substance
use and mental illness [19,20].
Depending on the local community context, and the
populations served, tailoring that attends to the social
and cultural context of people’s lives could include:
attention to styles of communication (both verbal and
non-verbal); efforts to provide services (where pos￾sible) in local languages; and adapting clinical practice
guidelines in ways that align with the priorities of
patients’ lives (which can be chaotic or stable at vari￾ous times). Most often, responsiveness to social con￾texts requires interdisciplinary team-based responses;
at the organizational level, this means ensuring that
staffing levels are adequate to assist patients with, for
example, completing lengthy disability forms, liaising
with social-services, child protection services and
other state authorities, and coordinating with other
health care organizations.
At the level of patient-provider interactions, tailoring
is essential to draw in, rather than limit access to care
by marginalized patient-populations. For example, what
might be seen as excellent interpersonal communica￾tion in one cultural context might be seen as discrim￾inatory or alienating in another. At the two PHC
Centres, initial greetings among people who identify as
Aboriginal often incorporate the phrase, “where are
you from?” to signal an awareness of the importance
of place and community of origin as an essential as￾pect of one’s identity. Among some immigrant groups,
however, this phrase can signal that one is viewed as
‘Other’. Similarly, when working with women with his￾tories of trauma who are at high risk of experiencing
re-traumatization during physical assessments, offering
choices and easing into health care encounters can
offer high impact ways of recognizing people’s vulner￾ability and foster trust as an essential component of
access to PHC.
Openly discussing various approaches to harm reduc￾tion, including how to manage opiate prescribing prac￾tices when there are high rates of substance use among
the patient population, is an example of tailoring that
can take place at organizational and provider levels.
These organizational-level discussions are critical when
working with client populations with high rates of sub￾stance use or chronic addictions combined with mul￾tiple forms of discrimination; conveying acceptance and
non-judgmental approaches are imperative to support￾ing people’s access to PHC services. As one patient
explained:
The whole thing of addiction is having people listen
and not judging. And most doctors, I know, except
for the select few that are here, they are all judging,
very judgmental of addicts.
Organizational policies can be tailored to meet the
needs of individual patients by implementing clinical
practice guidelines that are flexible, dynamic and can be
adapted to the person’s life context, personal circum￾stances, and highest priorities. For example, rather than
beginning with their substance use issues per se, staff at
the Centres working with mothers who use substances
often began with the women’s top priorities – support￾ing women to increase contact with children appre￾hended by state authorities, or supporting women to
parent their children to prevent child apprehension. As
one provider explained:
From a care provider perspective...if I can help you
keep your five-year-old daughter from going to foster
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 8 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

care, you know, that is very rewarding for me, if I
could be part of that solution – and very meaningful
for her, and more so for the five-year-old.
6. Actively counter the impact of intersecting
oppressions on health, access to care, and quality
of life
PHC providers and organizations need to be aware of
how marginalizing practices and social exclusion operate
in structures and institutions, including health care,
thereby shaping people’s health care experiences and ac￾cess to services; then, they can actively implement strat￾egies to counter these barriers. Our data aligns with the
growing body of evidence showing that disempowerment
and alienation of marginalized groups in society are
major obstacles to achieving health equity [1,22,40,52].
The positive impact of actively conveying respect and ac￾ceptance to individuals – and attending to power differ￾entials, is highly significant, particularly for people who
experience social exclusion on an everyday basis. A
woman who is a patient shared the impact:
Because a person doesn’t have that courage, you
know, they’ll sit there on the street thinking, it’ll be
[such a huge thing to go in for health care]...That’s
why I come – because they’ll let everyone in...You’re
missing so much on that connection – not connected
to anybody...Those kinds of just simple
gestures...just that little bit of, you know, good
human touch, once in a blue moon, can really help
somebody get to the next step, right? Good human
interaction and connections.
Our findings showed how countering racism, discrimin￾ation, stigmatization, and social exclusion can be achieved
by conveying unconditional positive regard for patients re￾gardless of their circumstances, and fostering the human
dignity of all persons even in informal interactions in wait￾ing rooms, at reception desks, over the telephone, or dur￾ing clinical encounters. Affirming approaches can be
ostensibly ‘small’ gestures, achieved through non-verbal
communication, tone of voice, and other types of commu￾nication, as one provider described:
I’ll stop and have a small conversation with the
person, or I’ll say, you know, I’m really happy to see
you here today, to let them know that they’re
appreciated. Because other than that, people never
see them [as people].
Creating an accepting, non-judgmental PHC environ￾ment also manifests in the ways staff respond to
patients’ expressions of frustrations or anger. This
requires that staff continually reflect on the personal and
social contexts which give rise to patients’ expressions of
anger, as a physician narrated:
I had a woman, 20-something, working the street,
HIV positive, heroin-addicted, comes in very angry,
hostile...I agreed to take her on for methadone and
HIV care, and she started out really hostile, but she
kept coming back. And then, after a year...she’s like,
“no, I wouldn’t go anywhere else” and, “I’m so
thankful for being here.” I just needed to accept
that...she might be angry and hostile for a while
but...eventually...the real person will emerge...
At an organizational level, actively countering the im￾pact of intersecting oppressions requires policies that
support a low barrier health care environment wherein
patients are, as one staff member described, “just allowed
to be.” They do not have to transform themselves into
something else to be seen as legitimate or credible.
One indicator of accessibility, especially for people
who are marginalized or ‘hard to reach’, is when patients
drop in or hang out at a Centre, without a specific ap￾pointment. A patient described the benefits:
It’s more or less come in and have coffee, you know.
You’re welcome. You won’t be chased out. And I feel
comfortable coming here, and like I said, because I
see a lot of my people here. And a lot of the staff, you
know, talk to you...Like I said there are times where I
don’t even need to be here, but I come here to talk to
a friend or have a coffee, you know, and just go home.
Our observational data showed that these strategies
had a visible impact; expressions of frustration or hostil￾ity by patients were infrequent, despite sometimes long
wait times in waiting rooms, and despite some people
being visibly under the influence of substances. On occa￾sion, when some people’s behaviours approached a dis￾ruptive level, staff (usually receptionists) respectfully
used communication styles to diffuse tensions and set
limits, which were usually respected. This contrasted
with our prior research in emergency departments where
we observed security guards routinely deal with beha￾viours in ways that often resulted in escalating frustration
and aggressive behaviours, and ended in dismissal or
banning of patients and police involvement [19,20,53].
PHC organizations can also exercise leadership within
their communities by increasing awareness of how racia￾lization and discrimination operate in health care set￾tings such as emergency departments, and in the wider
community, and by working to counter such oppression.
For example, a nurse at one of the Centres informed the
media about methadone dispensing pharmacies that
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 9 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

were exploiting vulnerable patients for economic gain;
this action contributed to an investigation and policy
changes to prevent such exploitation in the future.
7. Create opportunities to promote and foster
engagement with community and other sectors,
including participatory engagement by patients
Enhancing equity-capacity within PHC organizations
ideally will involve engagement and collaboration with
various sectors in the local community and beyond to
maximize opportunities to address the social contexts of
patients’ lives. For example, tailoring care, programs and
services to the contexts of patients’ lives could involve li￾aising with child welfare agencies to develop ways to sup￾port women at risk of having their children apprehended.
Actively countering discrimination could involve hosting
an in-service at the emergency departments known to be
frequented by patients to discuss possible anti-racist
approaches. Recognizing that not all PHC organizations
or staff have the flexibility to engage in these ways, this
strategy is held out as an ideal to work towards, and as a
starting point for meaningful dialogues within and be￾tween a range of health and social sectors. Such engage￾ment also requires action at the level of policy, so that
values related to equity can be effectively and democrat￾ically operationalized [54]. Following our example above,
liaising with child welfare agencies to develop ways to
support women would include, for instance, working on
health policies related to child health assessments and
social policies related to income support.
Participatory engagement of patients can take many
forms and PHC organizations can play a role in provid￾ing a sense of meaningful belongingness, for example, by
providing paid or volunteer opportunities including peer
support programs. These experiences offer powerful
points of connection for people marginalized by social
and structural inequities, who often experience social ex￾clusion. Having a meaningful focus and daily routine is
particularly relevant for patients who are homeless or
living in shelters, or who are unemployed or unable to
be employed due to persistent chronic physical or men￾tal illness, or substance use issues. At both Centres, for
example, patients are periodically hired on a part-time
basis (according to the availability of funds) to assist
with peer support activities, focus groups, and women’s
or men’s wellness programs. In one of the Centres, re￾search funds for a self-management HIV program were
used to hire patients as peer interviewers and research
assistants. Patients often expressed a sense of ownership
and responsibility in relation to ‘their’ Centre. In many
cases, patients who used the Centres regularly played a
role in shaping the physical and social milieu by volun￾tarily making coffee and replenishing supplies in the
waiting areas, voluntarily helping with janitorial or main￾tenance tasks, and offering suggestions for how to make
the physical space safer and more welcoming for women
and children. Engaging in meaningful work-related activ￾ities through volunteer and temporary or occasional em￾ployment opportunities can be health promoting by
enhancing people’s sense of self-efficacy, self-worth, and
capacity to manage their health [55], as this patient
described:
[I have] a paid position where I’m on call [for
janitorial work]. And that helped me, kept me busy.
It kept me from locking myself up and getting
depressed...I’ve got something, like I’m doing
something and I’m being responsible...If I didn’t have
the volunteering I would have been lost...I would
have just given up...Pay didn’t matter. It was just
somewhere to go and know that I was needed, that’s
what I needed, that’s kept me going.
Given the significance of participatory engagement,
PHC organizations are well-justified in seeking or allo￾cating funds to support volunteers or peer support
workers. It is equally critical for PHC organizations to
seek the input of patients at regular intervals so that
their feedback is part of quality assurance, and to remain
accountable to both local community and patient repre￾sentatives by ensuring that the organization is welcom￾ing and responsive to local populations. Organizations
can build such approaches through policy. For example,
one Centre requires that research conducted there in￾clude meaningful patient consultation and involvement
in the research process, including employment (e.g., as
research assistants or facilitators) when possible.
8. Tailor care, programs and services to the populations’
individual and group histories, with an emphasis on
trauma- and violence-informed care
This strategy is based on the premise that it is critical
to tailor programs and services to people’s individual and
group histories. Because trauma and violence are inter￾twined with inequities, recognizing the significance of
people’s histories means that PHC services must take
into account the fact that most people affected by sys￾temic inequities and structural violence have experienced
varying forms of trauma. Additionally, because people
with trauma histories often experience mistrust, building
trust is critical to sustaining connections and a sense of
personal safety in PHC [56]. As this patient elaborated:
We’re not just a number...That’s life saving, life
changing, literally it’s that valuable, it’s life changing
because when I was out there [on the street] it was
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 10 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

not good. It was always for something, you know, you
were selling your body or you’re giving up a piece of
yourself daily. And then to have somebody want to do
something for you, just to help you, like oh my god....
It gives you a whole new perspective, it really helps.
Trauma- and violence-informed care is not about elicit￾ing trauma histories; it is about creating a safe environ￾ment based on an understanding of the effects of trauma,
so that health care encounters are safe, affirming and val￾idating [24,29]. For example, PHC organizations serving
high numbers of Aboriginal patients must recognize that
many people have experienced the inter-generational
effects of systemic and individual discrimination and ra￾cism, which can be conceptualized as one feature of his￾torical trauma [21,22,57]. This conceptualization of
trauma has implications for other groups of people, for
example, refugees and in some contexts, new immi￾grants. In PHC contexts, such services are constituted by
respectful, empowerment practices, not ‘trauma treat￾ment’ such as psychotherapy (though referrals may be
made for specific trauma therapy). For example, in recog￾nition of the devaluing of Aboriginal culture as a result
of Canada’s colonial history, one of the Centres featured
signage in a local Indigenous dialect to convey a valuing
of Aboriginal identity; in the other, a residential school
healing program was implemented to support patients
and their families.
The effects of trauma often are manifested in health
and behavioural issues that initially appear to be unre￾lated [24]. Interpersonal violence experienced by women,
for instance, is associated with acute and chronic issues
such as: chronic pain (e.g., headache, migraine, back
pain, pelvic pain, inflammatory bowel disease), arthritis,
hypertension, higher rates of mental health problems,
higher rates of substance use and dependence, and
symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) [25,58]. Because these are common health
issues, health services may fall short in integrating
understandings of the long-term impact of trauma, and
inadvertently fail to create an environment that validates
patient experiences [24,25,30]. Trauma and violence￾informed care, therefore, requires that PHC organiza￾tions integrate comprehensive and continuing education
for all staff (including receptionists, direct care providers
and management) about the health effects of trauma and
the principles of trauma- and violence-informed care
[59], and about strategies for actively minimizing the risk
of re-traumatization in the everyday provision of ser￾vices, as one health care provider explains:
So, [in case conferences and team meetings] we talk
about...the level of trauma that this person comes
from...Or how difficult it is for that person to walk
through that door...Or how difficult it was for that
person to actually bring up their concern to
you...getting into conversations around our table
about power imbalances and about how our
interactions [with patients] can really affect this.
Equally critical are supports for staff who may be deal￾ing with vicarious trauma when working with patient
populations who have significant trauma histories. As
described by one health care provider:
She [was] a staff member that was not only in moral
distress from what she was seeing in this community
and taking it on but from also never resolving her
own background trauma and seeing how it triggered
her to work with the clients...but not having an
employee assistance program [EAP] to refer her to
for counseling [was hard]...I’ve lost about twenty
[staff]...I’ve lost them...when they couldn’t take the
stress...we don’t have any type of psychology services
or EAP...
Thus, tailoring and an emphasis on trauma- and
violence-informed care must take into account the
effects of working with highly traumatized patients,
and as identified in strategy two, funding must be
available to provide staff with adequate support. Given
the correlation between trauma and all forms of in￾equity, trauma- and violence-informed care is also
closely related to strategies to address social determi￾nants of health.
9. Enhance access to resources that address the social
determinants of health with an emphasis on
advocacy and inter-sectoral collaborations
Addressing the social determinants of health is
recognized as essential to PHC [7,38,39,40,60]; there￾fore, this strategy involves explicitly working to address
these issues as legitimate and routine aspects of health
care, often as the main priority. Maintaining or im￾proving health is dependent on access to adequate safe
housing, adequate nutrition, and meaningful activities.
For example, mental health or well-being (especially in
the face of PTSD and depression associated with all
forms of trauma) is challenging to achieve in the con￾text of inadequate social housing rife with rodent or in￾sect infestations; physical health is challenging to
achieve without a place to refrigerate food or medica￾tions [61]. At the individual level, this involves working
with patients to facilitate access to social housing,
food, and clothing, or supporting efforts toward paid
employment. Our data repeatedly documented the im￾pact of addressing people’s social needs as fundamental
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 11 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

to maintaining or improving health, as this patient
described:
I got the subsidy from them [the nurse and social
worker at the Centre] for housing and I got the kids
back now...I knew that I wanted to go to rehab [to
address substance use issues]. I’ve been thinking about
it for a whole year since I got the subsidy...That really
made me look in the mirror at myself...[The subsidy]
is like winning a lottery to me...[With] the subsidy, I
thought, I’ve really got to smarten up, pull up my socks
and start really watching the company I keep and start
getting my life on track. And it’s getting there....
Fostering connections with individuals, groups and
resources is critical, because many people experiencing
marginalization are disconnected from their families or
home communities by policies, poverty and violence.
Supporting connections to possible employment is critical
because most people served cannot afford phones or
computers, and thus have no way of being contacted.
At the organizational level, addressing this strategy
involves leaders and staff within PHC agencies taking on
advocacy roles and inter-sectoral collaboration in their
wider communities to influence policies, such as work￾ing with housing organizations to maximize the avail￾ability of social housing; working with child welfare
authorities to increase parents’ access to children and
visitation rights; looking at ways to mitigate the root
causes of homelessness; or advocating for more services
for people with mental health problems. This attention
to socio-political and economic environments must be
extended to more immediate social and physical
environments.
10. Optimize use of place/space to meet the needs of
client populations
Increasingly, the socio-spatial environments of health
care are being conceptualized as relational spaces that can
be intentionally designed to support people’s subjectivities
and experiences [62]. The notion of ‘therapeutic environ￾ments’ highlights the ways that socio-spatial environments
can be transformed to foster people’s sense of agency and
entitlement (or deservedness) when seeking PHC services.
This has significant implications for patient-populations
who experience discrimination and social exclusion in
their everyday lives. A patient explained:
They make you feel welcome and they know you by
name. And that means something to you, like
somebody knows me, and it just makes me feel like a
certain kind of pride inside you – like who you are
and where you come from.
At the organizational level, this could translate into an
agency’s commitment to create a low barrier and accept￾ing environment, as a receptionist described:
They come in and they’re cold and we welcome them
with a warm coffee, and tell them they’re welcome to
sit and chat, and sort of see how they are doing,
where they slept, if they slept.
This contrasts with the atmosphere in conventional
waiting rooms, as described by a physician:
You know what [typical] waiting rooms feel like...that
quietness, and contained-ness...Everybody sits in
their little world. That is so foreign to our clients that
they feel really out of place.
Essential to creating a therapeutic space are reception
staff who play an active role in setting the tone in waiting
rooms, during phone interactions, and during informal
conversations with patients. This has implications for the
kinds of training that staff receive, and requires their ac￾tive involvement within organizational and decision￾making structures. Creating supportive social spaces
within PHC settings can involve, for example, having
phones available for patients, a computer with internet
access, and freely available coffee and tea. To fully address
a population’s needs, providers may need to extend their
influence beyond the boundaries of the physical PHC
space by providing care in other spaces (i.e., shelters, peo￾ple’s homes, single-room occupancy hotels, outreach ser￾vices on the streets, etc.). Building on earlier strategies,
patients can be integral partners in planning and creating
such spaces and outreach processes.
In summary, these findings are based on a rigorous
analysis of a large set of ethnographic data as the foun￾dation for identifying the essential elements of equity￾oriented PHC services when working with marginalized
patient-populations, and will have broad application to a
wide range of settings, contexts and jurisdictions. One
limitation of this study is that the data collected were
based on research conducted in only two PHC Centres
in Canada. As well, the findings reflect team-based care
as the primary mechanism for delivery of PHC services,
and salaried versus fee-for-service compensation ar￾rangements for physicians and other staff. Further re￾search will be needed to examine the relevance and
operationalization of these key dimensions and strategies
when other models of service delivery are used, and in
other jurisdictions and national contexts.
Conclusions
A commitment to equity and social justice in PHC
requires recognition of the particular health and social
Browne et al. International Journal for Equity in Health 2012, 11:59 Page 12 of 15
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/11/1/59

needs of people subject to systematic discrimination
and relatively little power [63]. If the PHC sector is to
become optimally relevant as a site for population
health interventions, PHC organizations will need to
prioritize locally-relevant strategies that are explicitly
oriented to working with these groups, where it is
expected that the greatest gains can be achieved.
If equity-oriented PHC organizations are to flourish, they
will require support by inter-sectoral government policies
and flexible funding models that recognize the essential role
of community-based organizations in fostering health
equity. The four key dimensions and 10 strategies for en￾hancing capacity for equity-oriented PHC services are im￾portant to hold out as ideals, given the persistence and
increasing levels of health and health care inequities across
population groups in Canada and other nations.
Recognizing that a wide range of models are currently
used to address the health needs of vulnerable popula￾tions, consideration needs to be given to which aspects of
the framework outlined in Figure 1 will be most relevant
and feasible in particular contexts. The four key dimen￾sions of equity-oriented PHC services are broad enough
to be relevant as principles for guiding organizations and
individual clinicians in primary care practices. Each
organization, agency or practice can prioritize their start￾ing point, given that the 10 strategies can be implemen￾ted incrementally, and in seemingly ‘small’ ways that do
not require additional costs. For example, even at an in￾dividual physician’s practice, changing the manner with
which receptionists answer phone calls or schedule
appointments can have powerful effects on patients; in
some settings, that kind of adjustment will signify that
efforts are being made to counter the ongoing dismissal
that many patients experience, thus addressing strategy
six. Finding ways to address any aspect of the 10 strat￾egies will have a synergistic and compounding effect
because they overlap and intersect. The 10 strategies
also can serve as a stimulus, for example, for develop￾ing new inter-sectoral collaborations; arguing for differ￾ent funding models; expanding one’s referral patterns
(e.g., to social service agencies, trauma-counsellors,
etc.); and engaging in advocacy work or community
service activities. Although some of the strategies may
seem to run counter to dominant trends in health care
that emphasize the rapid processing of patients, our re￾search shows that if marginalized populations are to be
served effectively, radically different approaches are
required and can be legitimized as more efficient.
These strategies also have the potential to positively in￾fluence PHC services more widely because by enhan￾cing equity-competence for marginalized populations,
improvements in PHC service delivery can be realized
for all populations. Contrary to dominant rhetoric
about efficiencies in health care, our data show that
equity-based strategies can result in improved health
outcomes and quality of life; the next step in research
will be to link these strategies to quantifiable process
and outcome measures.
Endnotes a In Canada, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is used gen￾erally to refer to Indigenous groups comprising First
Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples [64]. These three
groups reflect ‘organic political and cultural entities that
stem historically from the original peoples of North
America, rather than collections of individuals united by
so-called ‘racial’ characteristics’ [64](p. xii). b PHC is conceptualized as the principal vehicle for
the delivery of health care at the most local level of a
country's health system, and is the first level of contact
for individuals, families and communities, constituting
the first element of a continuing health care process.
The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that
PHC embodies the principles of universal access, equity,
and social justice [6,7]. Further, the WHO claims that ef￾fectively operationalizing PHC reform necessitates
achieving universal access and social protection so as to
improve health equity; reorganizing service delivery
around people’s needs and expectations; securing health￾ier communities through better public policies; and re￾modeling leadership for health around more effective
government and the active participation of key stake￾holders. Implementing PHC is therefore foundational to
addressing inequities, yet little progress has been made
to date in actualizing that implementation. c Health equity is defined as the absence of systematic
and potentially remediable differences in one or more
characteristics of health across populations or popula￾tion groups defined socially, economically, demographic￾ally, or geographically [7,11].
d In Canada, "visible minority" refers to persons who
are identified according to Canada’s Employment Equity
Act “as being non-Caucasian...or non-white in colour.
Under the Act, Aboriginal persons are not considered to
be members of visible minority groups” [47].

Acknowledgments
