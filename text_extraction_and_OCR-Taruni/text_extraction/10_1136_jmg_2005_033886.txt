Abstract
Objective: To report the frequency of single and multiple gene
mutations in an Australian cohort of patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM).
Methods: Genetic screening of seven HCM genes (β-MHC, MyBP-C,
cTnT, cTnI, ACTC, MYL2, and MYL3) was undertaken in 80
unrelated probands. Screening was by denaturing high performance
liquid chromatography and direct DNA sequencing. Clinical data
were collected on all patients and on genotyped family members.
Results: 26 mutations were identified in 23 families (29%).
Nineteen probands (24%) had single mutations (11 β-MHC, 4
MyBP-C, 3 cTnI, 1 cTnT). Multiple gene mutations were identified
in four probands (5%): one had a double mutation and the others
had compound mutations. Six of 14 affected individuals from
multiple mutation families (43%) experienced a sudden cardiac
death event, compared with 10 of 55 affected members (18%) from
single mutation families (p = 0.05). There was an increase in septal
wall thickness in patients with compound mutations (mean (SD):
30.7 (3.1) v 24.4 (7.4) mm; p<0.05).
Conclusions: Multiple gene mutations occurring in HCM families
may result in a more severe clinical phenotype because of a “double
dose” effect. This highlights the importance of screening the entire
panel of HCM genes even after a single mutation has been
identified.
