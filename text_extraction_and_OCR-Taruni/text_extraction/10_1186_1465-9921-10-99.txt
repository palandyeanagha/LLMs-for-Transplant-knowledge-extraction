Abstract
Background: The study of small airway diseases such as post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome (BOS) is hampered by the difficulty in assessing peripheral airway function either
physiologically or directly. Our aims were to develop robust methods for sampling small airway
epithelial cells (SAEC) and to establish submerged SAEC cultures for downstream experimentation.
Methods: SAEC were obtained at 62 post-transplant bronchoscopies in 26 patients using
radiologically guided bronchial brushings. Submerged cell cultures were established and SAEC
lineage was confirmed using expression of clara cell secretory protein (CCSP).
Results: The cell yield for SAEC (0.956 ± 0.063 × 106) was lower than for large airway cells (1.306
± 0.077 × 106) but did not significantly impact on the culture establishment rate (79.0 ± 5.2% vs.
83.8 ± 4.7% p = 0.49). The presence of BOS significantly compromised culture success
(independent of cell yield) for SAEC (odds ratio (95%CI) 0.067 (0.01-0.40)) but not LAEC (0.3
(0.05-1.9)). Established cultures were successfully passaged and expanded.
Conclusion: Primary SAEC can be successfully obtained from human lung transplant recipients
and maintained in culture for downstream experimentation. This technique will facilitate the
development of primary in vitro models for BOS and other diseases with a small airway component
such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD.
Background
Although lung transplantation is a well-accepted thera￾peutic option for selected patients with advanced lung dis￾ease, long-term survival is limited largely by progressive
and treatment refractory airflow limitation manifest clini￾cally as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [1]. The
predominant histopathologic finding in patients with
BOS is of fibro-proliferative small airway obliteration
(obliterative bronchiolitis (OB)). Unfortunately, there
has been no substantial improvement in the reported inci￾Published: 26 October 2009

dence of BOS over the last twenty years, despite improve￾ments in immunosuppression, surgical techniques, and
patient management [2,3]. Recognition of the central role
of OB in limiting post-transplant survival has led to a large
body of research aimed it improving management [4-7].
However, all in vitro human studies have used large airway
epithelial cells (LAEC) despite OB being predominantly a
small airway disease. The aim of this study was to develop
methodology for the successful sampling and culture of
small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) obtained from lung
transplant patients at routine post-transplant bronchos￾copy. The described techniques will provide a more rele￾vant in vitro human cell based model to study the
pathogenesis of OB.
Methods
Reagents
Foetal Calf Serum (FCS), RPMI-1640 media, penicillin G,
streptomycin sulphate, amphotericin B and L-glutamine
were purchased from Invitrogen (Melbourne, Australia).
Insulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), hydrocortisone,
recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF),
epinephrine hydrochloride, triiodothyronine, retinoic
acid, trypsin and gentamycin were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, USA). Bronchial epithelium basal medium
(BEBM) was purchased from LONZA™ (Basel, Switzer￾land). Ultroser G was supplied from Ciphergen (Cergy￾Saint-Christophe, France). Collagen S (type I) as well as
fibronectin were purchased from Roche (Dee Why, Aus￾tralia). All tissue culture plastic ware was obtained from
Sarstedt (Mawson Lakes, Australia).
Patients
A total of 62 bronchoscopies were performed in 26
patients (11 female; aged 18 to 64 years (median 51
years); 4 BOS). Patient demographics are summarized in
Table 1. BOS was diagnosed and graded according to
international guidelines [2]. The study was approved by
the Royal Perth Hospital Human Research and Ethics
Committee.
Bronchoscopy procedure
Human airway epithelial cells (AEC) were collected using
a bronchial brush during routine surveillance and diag￾nostic post-transplant bronchoscopies. Bronchoscopy was
conducted under general anaesthesia with a laryngeal
mask or endotracheal tube. The bronchoscope(Olympus®
Evis EXERA II) was wedged in a suitable lateral segment of
the right or left lower lobe. Prior to the acquisition of
transbronchial biopsies, the sheathed nylon cytology
brush (10 mm, 2 mm outer diameter, Olympus BC￾25105, Waverley, Australia) was passed down the working

channel of the bronchoscope and then unsheathed under
radiological guidance with the brush tip lying 2-3 cm
from the pleural surface. Small airway brushings (2-3
brushings) were collected from this area (Fig. 1).
Large airways brushings (*2-3) were obtained from seg￾mental bronchi in the standard way. In both cases, brush￾ings were collected into a tube containing 2 ml of RPMI
on ice and the brush tip was also cut off and collected after
the final brushing. After the completion of brushings,
20% (v/v) FCS was added to the tubes and processed
immediately. Tubes and brushes were kept separate for
large and small airways to prevent cross contamination.
The lung apex was screened to exclude a pneumothorax as
part of routine care following a transbronchial biopsy.
Establishment of cultures
During processing, the cells were fractionated for RNA
archiving, cytospins and cell culture as previously
described [8]. Successful culture establishment was
assessed as previously described [8] and cultures were pas￾saged at 90% confluence. Additionally, a human bron￾chial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o-
; provided by Dieter
Gruenert, University of California San Francisco, USA)
was also utilised and maintained as previously described
[8].
Growth media and culture conditions
Primary SAEC and LAEC were maintained in Bronchial
Epithelial Basal Media (BEBM) (Lonza™) supplemented
with 2% (v/v) Ultroser G, 50 μg/mL bovine pituitary
extract, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 5 ng/mL human epi￾dermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/mL epinephrine, 6.5 ng/mL
triiodothyronine, 5 μg/mL insulin, 1 ng/mL retinoic acid,
10 μg/mL transferrin, and 0.001% gentamycin (v/v).
16HBE14o- cells were maintained in Dubelco's Minimum
Essential Media (DMEM) (Invitrogen (Melbourne, Aus￾tralia)), FCS (10%, v/v), penicillin (100 U/ml), strepto￾mycin (100 μg/ml) and amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml). All
cell cultures were grown in a NUAIRE (Plymouth, USA)
incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air
under strict aseptic conditions.
Epithelial lineage verification
Cells from the cultures before the first passage (p0) and
after the second passage (p2) of both SAEC and LAEC
were cytospun onto glass slides and epithelial lineage ver￾ified by immunocytochemistry (ICC) as previously
described [8]. First passage (p0) and p2 were specifically
chosen because most experiments were conducted at p2
and cells were generally not propagated beyond that.
Briefly, cytospins were incubated with primary antibodies
specific for mesenchymal (Vimentin 1:250) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, USA), endothelial (von
Willebrand factor 1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
Santa Cruz, USA), macrophage (CD68 1:500) (DAKO
Corp, Carpinteria, USA), dendritic (CD1a 1:250) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, USA), and epithelial
lineages (AE1-AE3 1:250) (DAKO Corp, Carpinteria,
USA) for 24 hours at 4°C followed by fluorescently con￾jugated secondary antibodies for a similar period. Second￾ary antibodies included; anti-mouse FITC conjugate
(1:100), anti-goat FITC conjugate (1:100) and anti-rabbit
FITC conjugate (all Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The slides were
observed under a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsys￾tem Pty. Ltd., Wetzlar, Germany) for staining. AE1-AE3
was chosen as the positive marker for epithelial cells since
it is a mixture of clones AE1 and AE3. AE1 detects high
molecular weight keratins 10, 14, 15, and 16 as well as
low molecular weight cytokeratin-19. Clone AE3 detects
the high molecular weight cytokeratins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,
and the low molecular weight cytokeratins 7 and 8. By
combining the two reagents a broad spectrum of reactivity
is achieved.
Small airway epithelial lineage verification
When cells reached 90% confluence in culture, they were
trypsinised, collected and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI.
The cell suspension was then fractionated and a 350 μl
aliquot was centrifuged and pelleted cells stored in RLT
buffer (QIAGEN, Hamburg, Germany). RNA was
extracted using QIAGEN RNA Easy Mini Kit. The remain￾Brushing of small airways Figure 1 under radiological guidance

der of the cell suspension was seeded into pre-coated
flasks to continue propagation of the culture. Lineage was
verified by analysing mRNA from a representative group
of cultures chosen at random from patients who were not
diagnosed with BOS. Quantitative polymerase chain reac￾tion (qPCR) was used to assess expression of the Clara
Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP), which is uniquely
expressed by small airway epithelial cells, and surfactant
protein B (SP-B), which is commonly expressed by non￾ciliated bronchial epithelial cells [9] and type II alveolar
cells [10]. Lineage verification was carried out on mRNA
from cultures at p0 and p2. Gene expression was analyzed
using two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and cDNA synthesized using hexanu￾cleotide primers and Multiscribe™ Reverse Transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) in a final reaction
volume of 20 μL containing 1 × RT buffer (Promega Mad￾ison, USA), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM of each of the dNTPs,
2.5 μM random hexamers, 0.4 U RNase inhibitor, 1.25 U
Multiscribe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA)
reverse transcriptase and 200 ng RNA. All reactions were
performed under the following conditions: initial primer
incubation step at 25°C for 10 minutes followed by RT
incubation at 48°C for 1 hour and ended by reverse tran￾scriptase inactivation at 95°C for 5 minutes. The cDNA
was then used in a final PCR reaction volume of 25 μL
containing 1× Sybr Green PCR master mix (Applied Bio￾systems, Foster City, USA), 0.5 μM each of forward and
reverse primers and 5 μL of cDNA (1:5). The conditions
for the PCR include initial incubation at 50°C for 2 min￾utes, AmpliTaq Gold activation at 95°C for 10 minutes
followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute
at 60°C. The sequences of the primers used
included;CCSP; forward; '5AAACCCTCCTCAT GGAC
ACAC3' and reverse '3GACGGTACGAAACTCAGGT5', SP￾B; forward; '5TCACACACAGGATCTCTCCG3' and reverse
3'AGGTCGTGGTAGGTGTGGAG5', 18S; forward; '5TAAC
CCGTTGAACCCCATTC3' and reverse '3TCCAATCGG
TAGTAGCGACG5'.
Quantitative PCR was performed using the ABI Prism
7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer, USA)
and signals were analyzed by the ABI Prism Sequence
Detection System software version 1.9. Expression of
CCSP and SP-B was quantified relative to the expression
of 18S.

All results were tested for population normality and
homogeneity of variance and are presented as mean ±

t-test for continuous variables. p values < 0.05 were con￾sidered to be significant.
Results
Brushings were successfully obtained from both the small
and large airways of the transplanted lung at all 62 bron￾choscopies. The brushing method was well tolerated by all
patients with no significant bleeding, pneumothorax or
other adverse events being observed. The mean cell yield
from the allograft was significantly higher for LAEC
(1.306 ± 0.077 × 106) than for SAEC (0.956 ± 0.063 × 106;
p < 0.01). No significant difference in yield was noted
between BOS and non-BOS patients (Fig. 2).
Cell culture establishment
Cell cultures were successfully established from both large
and small airway brushings with a similar success rate
(83.8 ± 4.7% and 79.0 ± 5.2%; p = 0.49 respectively).
Established cultures reached confluence within a median
21 days (range 13 - 57 days) and maintained a polygonal,
cobblestone appearance, typical of epithelial cells. No
major morphological variations were observed between
LAEC and SAEC over the life of the culture (Fig 3). Immu￾nocytochemistry conducted on cells from passage 0 (p0)
and passage 2 (p2) with epithelial, and mesenchymal
markers confirmed the preservation of epithelial lineage
of the cells.
Culture fates are presented in Table 2. Successful estab￾lishment was limited predominantly by superinfection by
organisms colonizing the transplanted organ (2 patients,
A. fumigatus and S. aureus) and low cell yield. The latter
problem was confined to SAEC - failure of five of the cul￾tures could be attributed to low cell yield and they were all
from small airway brushings. The mean cell yield for the
five failed cultures was 0.326 ± 0.055 × 106 cells, which is
significantly lower than the cell yield for successful cul￾tures (1.071 ± 0.070 × 106 cells; p < 0.01). The presence of
BOS significantly compromised culture success for SAEC
(odds ratio (95%CI) 0.067 (0.01-0.40)) but not for LAEC
(0.3 (0.05-1.9)). Since the cell yield was not different for
BOS SAEC, poor culture establishment did not appear to
be related to low starting cell numbers.
Epithelial lineage verification
Morphological analysis of established cultures over repet￾itive passage showed that the typical cobblestone mor￾phology indicative of epithelial cells was maintained over
culture duration. Epithelial lineage was further verified at
each passage via immunocytochemical staining. Cultured
SAEC and LAEC stained intensely and exclusively for the
epithelial specific marker, AE1-AE3 (cytokeratin) at both
p0 and p2. No expression was observed for mesenchymal
(Vimentin), macrophage (CD68), dendritic (CD1a) or
endothelial (Von Willebrand Factor) lineage markers at
either passage (Fig. 4).
Small airway epithelial lineage verification
Lineage verification of established cultures was then
assessed using known and suggested markers of small air￾way epithelium [11,12]. Here, we assessed small airway
gene expression of CCSP and SP-B using qPCR on RNA
extracted from cultures at p0 and p2. CCSP was exclu￾sively expressed in SAEC (4592 ± 743.4 fold normalized
to 18 s at p0; 7148 ± 5385 fold normalized to 18 s at p2)
compared to LAEC (11.56 ± 9.113 fold normalized to 18
s at p0, p = 0.0001; 235 ± 275.6 normalized to 18 s at p2,
p = 0.0113). CCSP was not expressed in a LAEC immortal￾ized cell line (16HBE14o- cells (Fig. 5A &5B)). To exclude
an alveolar source for the small airway brush cellular
material, SP-B gene expression was also assessed in large
and small airway cell cultures at p0 and p2. SP-B was
expressed only at low levels in both SAEC and LAEC at p0
and p2. There was no difference between SAEC and LAEC

expressed by 16HBE14o- cells (Fig. 5C &5D).
Discussion
We have developed a method for successfully collecting
and establishing expandable primary cultures from
human SAEC obtained bronchoscopically. The method
was well tolerated and easy to perform. The cell yield
using this collection method was lower in small airway
brushings than the large airway brushings however this
did not significantly compromise the culture establish￾ment rate. Both LAEC and SAEC maintained their lineage
over passage.
The inability to establish a suitable in vitro model using
primary human cells has been a major impediment to
research into post-transplant chronic allograft dysfunc￾tion. The most relevant in vitro work has been conducted
on human LAEC despite BOS being a disease of small air￾ways [7,13]. It is highly probable that in vitro work in
LAEC can not be neatly extrapolated to SAEC. The
described methods will facilitate the development of
more relevant in vitro models not only for OB, but also for
other diseases with small airway pathology. In the case of
transplantation for instance, OB is the result of a range of
alloreactive, infective and non-specific insults and recent
evidence suggests that transforming growth factor β (TGF￾β1) driven epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the
final common pathway to airway obstruction and fibro￾sis[14]. Using the model described herein, EMT can be
induced by TGF-β1 in vitro, with the ability to assess candi￾date compounds for therapeutic efficacy.
Several investigators have successfully established LAEC
cultures from bronchial brushings, which have been used
to study a wide range of diseases including OB [7,13],
asthma [8], cystic fibrosis [15] and COPD [16]. The
present study has extended these methods to SAEC. The
LAEC collection and extraction methods described here
are very similar to those reported by Forrest et. al. [17].

(VWF)), macrophage (CD68), dendritic (CD1a), and epithelial lineages (AE1-AE3) for 24 hours at 4°C followed by fluores￾cently conjugated secondary antibodies for a similar period. The slides were counterstained with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylin￾dole (DAPI), which illuminates cell nuclear material (blue). Results confirmed that established cultures were not contaminated 
by any other cell types since and were considered pure epithelial cultures by the sole expression of all cells with the epithelial 
lineage marker AE1-AE3 (magnification 400×).

The cell yield in this case was lower than that reported
(~4.1 × 106 cells) but the number of brushings conducted
was also lower in comparison (2-3 vs. 4-6)[17]. However,
when compared to cell yields from non-transplant [18] or
paediatric patients [8], yields are much lower. Reasons
behind the reduced yield are unclear but may be specific
to the post-transplant state or related to medication.
Although large numbers of bronchial epithelial cells have
been collected from sources such as surgically resected
lung [19], explanted lung [20] and cadavers [21], sample
availability severely limits the utility of this approach in
high turnover laboratory projects. Conversely, using
brushings from lungs from living patients not only allows
the collection of a much higher numbers of samples, but
also facilitates longitudinal analyses and the more rapid
translation of in vitro studies to clinical practice.
As with LAEC, SAEC from whole lung or resection tissue
have been successfully cultured using similar methodolo￾gies [20,21]. SAEC have also been obtained using an
ultrathin fibrescope [22-24] or unguided bronchial brush￾ings [12]. However, only one laboratory has successfully
cultured human SAEC from bronchial brushings [25],
derived from smokers, COPD patients and controls using
an ultrathin fibrescope. These SAEC were directly cultured
in 48 well plates and harvested for ICC. Although epithe￾lial lineage was verified, no data was reported confirming
small airway lineage [25], and the utility of this in vitro
model was limited since cultures were not expanded
through repeated passage. Expanded cultures facilitate
varied experiments and the acquisition of multifaceted
data including cellular morphology, gene and protein
expression, and soluble protein expression in culture
supernatant.
The culture establishment rate was higher than that
reported by similar studies [17], but was still compro￾mised by contamination with passenger organisms, insuf￾ficient cell yield and BOS. Bacterial and fungal
contamination occurred despite the inclusion of antibi￾otic (gentamycin, penicillin and streptamycin) and anti￾fungal (amphotericin B) agents. Attempts at increasing
the doses of these agents in culture media were unsuccess￾ful due to cytotoxicity (data not shown). Unfortunately
endemic infection with opportunistic pathogens is com￾mon in this patient group and has been previously noted
to compromise large airway cell culture [13,17]. In this
study, we interestingly observed that establishing cell cul￾tures from small airway (but not large airway) brushings
of BOS patients was more difficult. Forrest et al did not
report the effect of BOS grade on culture establishment
[17], and we can find no other literature on the topic. Fur￾ther investigation revealed revealed that the inability to
establish cultures from BOS affected small airways was
independent of both cell yield and the presence of passen￾ger organisms (Table 2). Collectively, our results suggest
that identifying the reasons for poor culture establishment
may in fact provide insight into BOS pathogenesis. In this
regard, our laboratory is currently investigating epithelial
cell phenotype and function in BOS, the progenitor capac￾ity and proliferative potential of these cells, as well as their
tendency to undergo programmed cell death or senes￾cence.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed methodology for suc￾cessfully collecting and culturing SAEC from humans dur￾ing bronchoscopy. The techniques employed utilise
commonly available equipment, facilitating easy and con￾sistent sample collection. Given the importance of the
small airways in a number of pulmonary diseases, includ￾ing OB, the methods established here could facilitate sev￾eral avenues of respiratory research. The present authors
are using SAEC from transplanted lungs to develop an in
vitro model for OB, however the sampling techniques
described could be used to develop small airway sub￾merged or air liquid interface culture models for diseases
such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD.
