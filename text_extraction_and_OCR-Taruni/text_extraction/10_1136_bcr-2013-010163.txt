SUMMARY
A 35-year-old woman with background of liver cirrhosis
and portal hypertension secondary to chronic hepatitis C
presented with complication of hypersplenism and
thrombocytopenia. She developed severe menorrhagia
requiring multiple blood transfusions. In addition, her
interferon therapy was withheld owing to the underlying
thrombocytopenia. Partial splenic embolisation was
performed, which improved her platelet counts.
Subsequently, the menorrhagia was resolved and her
interferon therapy was restarted.
BACKGROUND
Thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease second￾ary to hepatitis virus is most commonly attributed
to hypersplenism secondary to cirrhosis and portal
hypertension.1 It also can be due to autoantibodies
against platelets or myelosuppressive action of the
hepatitis virus. Partial splenic embolisation (PSE) is
an effective method to treat thrombocytopenia in
patients with cirrhosis.2 In view of its known
potential complications, PSE is normally reserved
for specific clinical setting after calculating the risks
and benefits. This case is an example of PSE as a
feasible, but often an overlooked, method to treat
severe thrombocytopenia secondary to
hypersplenism.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 35-year-old woman with a history of chronic
hepatitis C genotype 1 and child’s B liver cirrhosis
presented with recurrent episodes of menorrhagia
for 2 months. The patient’s menorrhagia was
severe and debilitating. There was no symptom of
lethargy. She was on interferon therapy for her
chronic hepatitis.
On examination she was pale. There was no evi￾dence of koilonychia or angular cheilitis and no
external stigmata of chronic liver disease. The
patient’s abdomen was soft with splenomegaly.
She was haemodynamically stable (HR 85 bpm,
blood pressure 135/70).
INVESTIGATIONS
The patient’s blood showed evidence of pancyto￾penia. The platelet, haemoglobin and white cell
levels were 35.0×109
/L, 6.0 g/dL and 3.1×109
/L,
respectively. International noramalised ratio was
raised measuring 1.4. The renal and liver profiles
were within normal limits. The peripheral blood
smear revealed microcytic and hypochromic red
blood cells, suggestive of underlying chronic blood
loss. The platelet count progressively decreased to
the lowest level of 9.0×109
/L. In view of the pan￾cytopenia, bone marrow aspirate trephine was per￾formed showing normocellularity consistent with
peripheral destruction.
The ultrasound study revealed coarse liver echo￾texture in keeping with cirrhosis associated with
sign of portal hypertension (splenomegaly with
splenic hilar varices).
Pipelle investigation of the uterus was negative
for malignancy and consistent with dysfunctional
bleeding. There was no sign of any bleeding else￾where. Both colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduo￾denoscopy (OGDS) were performed. The
colonoscopy result was normal while the OGDS
showed only small erosion at the stomach antrum
with very mild gastropathy in the fundus, unlikely
to be the culprit of her anaemia.
It was concluded that the pancytopenia was
caused by hypersplenism secondary to cirrhosis and
portal hypertension. The anaemia was further wor￾sened by severe menorrhagia.
TREATMENT
She was started on provera 10 mg twice daily.
However, despite the medication, her menorrhagia
continued to become a problem as the platelet level
was very low. She also developed anaemia from
chronic blood loss requiring multiple blood transfu￾sions to keep the haemoglobin at a safe level. In
addition, her interferon therapy was stopped as it
was contraindicated in severe thrombocytopenia.
In view of limited treatment option coupled with
debilitating recurrent menorrhagia secondary to
thrombocytopenia, she was referred for PSE. The
platelet level pre-procedure was 11 × 109
/L. She
was explained about the procedure and the risk
involved with it, that is, pain, bleeding, postemboli￾sation syndrome, venous thrombosis and splenic
abscess. Written consent was taken. Four units of
platelets and 1.5 g of cefuroxime were given prior
to the procedure. Three bags of packed blood cells
were transfused a week before, a day before and
during the procedure.
PSE was finally performed under a strict aseptic
technique. The catheterisation of the splenic artery
was achieved through right femoral artery
approach. Lower pole and mid pole branches of
the splenic artery were selectively cannulated and
injected with polyvinyl alcohol 335–500 mm via a
5Fr Yashiro catheter. Postembolisation angiogram
revealed an approximate total of 50% of spleen
was embolised (figure 1). No immediate

complication was encountered during the procedure and the
patient’s vital signs remained stable throughout.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The platelet count tripled within a day and continued to rise
above 110×109
/L. The patient’s white cell count also raised
from less than 3.0×109
/L to an average of 13.0×109
/L and her
haemoglobin stabilised at level of 11.0–13.0 g/dL.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed at 2 months post￾procedure and showed expected area of necrosis of the spleen
(figure 2).
The increase in platelet count was sustained for a year
and her interferon therapy was restarted. She no longer
had menorrhagia while still on provera 5 mg twice daily. No
observable complication related to PSE within the period of
2-year-follow-up.
DISCUSSION
Thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease is a fairly frequent
phenomenon. The prevalence ranges between 15 and 70%,
being greater among patients with advanced cirrhosis.1 Among
other aetiological mechanisms, thrombocytopenia is most com￾monly attributed to portal hypertension with hypersplenism.1
Hypersplenism represents the increased pooling and destruction
of the corpuscular elements of the blood by the enlarged spleen.
Owing to current lack of effective pharmacological treatment
options able to increase platelet count, splenectomy and trans￾catheter arterial PSE continue to be applied in specific settings.
PSE is more favourable than splenectomy as it is generally a
gentler approach and is associated with lower mortality rate.3
Preservation of some functional splenic parenchyma is also
thought to provide protection from overwhelming bacteria
sepsis.3 Splenic embolisation for hypersplenism was first per￾formed in the 1970s and the subsequent studies have demon￾strated its consistent efficacy in treating thrombocytopenia of

patient with chronic liver disease.2 The present study is an
example where severe thrombocytopenia secondary to hypers￾plenism needs to be treated. The thrombocytopenia has caused
severe menorrhagia and was a contraindication to the patient’s
treatment of interferon therapy.
Apart from to treat hypersplenism secondary to hepatic
disease, other indications of PSE include chronic idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary sherocytosis and splenic
trauma in haemodynamically unstable patient.4 The use of
splenic artery embolisation for treatment of splenic artery aneur￾ysms and spontaneous rupture of splenic haemangioma have
also been documented.2
PSE is not a procedure without any risk. The potential compli￾cations include post-embolisation syndrome, splenic abscess,
splenic rupture, refractory ascites, distal pancreatitis and gastroin￾tenstinal bleeding.5 6 Pulmonary disorders, such as pneumonia,
atelectasis and pleural effusions, are the other potential complica￾tions, which usually develop in the left lung and are associated
with embolisation of the upper pole of the spleen.4
Post-embolisation syndrome is the by far the most frequent side
effect and is regarded as minor,6 7 with fever, malaise, discomfort
and leucocytosis and generally lasts not more than 3–5 days.
Some patients may need major analgesic administration and long
hospital stay. More severe complications like portal/splenic vein
thrombosis or splenic abscess resulting in death may occur.7
Hence, careful selection of patient is crucial to prevent these
serious complications.
When embolisation is planned, visualisation of the pancreatic
arteries is important to avoid unintended embolisation as the
splenic artery has many branches that supply the pancreatic
body and tail. Contraindications of PSE include terminal end
stage of the underlying disease as well as presence of on going
infection. Severe infection is associated with formation of
splenic abscess postprocedure.2 Our patient did not develop any
significant complication during and after the PSE procedure.
The increase in platelet count observed following PSE is asso￾ciated with reduction of platelet pool in the diminished volume
of infarcted spleen. In addition, increased availability of throm￾bopoietin owing to decreased intrasplenic degradation also con￾tributes to more platelet production.8 The extent of
embolisation is important to determine the success of the pro￾cedure. Embolisation of less than 50% is thought to yield high
chances of relapse of hypersplenism whereas infarction of more
than 70% is associated with a high rate of complication, favour￾ing bacterial contamination.9
