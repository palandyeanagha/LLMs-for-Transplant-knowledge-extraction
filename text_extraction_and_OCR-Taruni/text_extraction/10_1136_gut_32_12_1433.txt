Aetiology and natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis -
a decade of progress?
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver
disease that is characterised by an obliterative inflammatory
fibrosis of the biliary tract. This chronic inflammation
frequently results in bile duct obliteration, biliary cirrhosis,
hepatic failure, and sometimes in cholangiocarcinoma.
Although the first description of primary sclerosing
cholangitis was made a century ago by Hoffman' in 1867,
over the next 100 years the disease remained a medical rarity.
The advent of endoscopic cholangiography in the 1970s,
however, enabled the diagnosis to be made in an ever
increasing number of patients. This led to the publication in
1980 of two reviews of large numbers of patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis from the Mayo Clinic2 and the
Royal Free Hospital.3 These studies described the clinical,
histological, and radiological features of the characteristic
chronic cholestatic syndrome of primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis. Interest was reawakened on both sides of the Atlantic,
and since 1980 progress in our understanding of all aspects of
this fascinating disease has been remarkable."
Relation with inflammatory bowel disease
The close relation between inflammatory bowel disease and
various hepatobiliary disorders is well established. In the last
decade, however, a different concept of hepatobiliary dis￾order in inflammatory bowel disease has emerged. It is now
apparent that the major hepatobiliary diseases seen in
association with inflammatory bowel disease, pericholangitis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and
most cases of chronic active hepatitis represent different
aspects of the same spectrum of hepatobiliary disease - viz
primary sclerosing cholangitis.
For many years the term.'pericholangitis' has been synony￾mous with involvement of the liver in inflammatory bowel
disease.78 However, it has become clear that most patients
with histological pericholantitis, defined as an inflammatory
portal reaction with periductular inflammation and fibrosis,
will have cholangiographic appearances diagnostic of
primary sclerosing cholangitis.9 A minority of patients with
ulcerative colitis will have persistently abnormal liver func￾tion tests together with histological appearances such as
concentric fibrosis, but have normal bile ducts at cholangio￾graphy. The term 'small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis'
has been proposed to replace the term 'pericholangitis' in this
group of patients, as the evidence suggests that these
conditions are all part of the same disease spectrum. Wee and
Ludwig described two patients who progressed from small
duct primary sclerosing cholangitis to develop extrahepatic
biliary involvement.'0 Chronic active hepatitis has been
reported in association with ulcerative colitis." However,
piecemeal necrosis on liver histology can accompany the
classic bile duct changes of primary sclerosing cholangitis on
cholangiography3 and it seems likely that most patients with
chronic active hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease will
have either large or small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The relation between primary sclerosing cholangitis and
inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, is
a very close one. Approximately 70% of all patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis have coexisting ulcerative
colitis,'-4 and primary sclerosing cholangitis is the most
common form of chronic liver disease found in ulcerative
colitis, occurring in 3-10% of patients.49 Three studies from
different parts of the world have reviewed the clinical features
of patients with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis.11 The findings from all three have been remark￾ably consistent. Paradoxically, the colitis is usually total but
symptomatically mild, often with no rectal bleeding, and
characterised by prolonged remissions. Although the
symptoms of ulcerative colitis usually develop before those of
sclerosing cholangitis, in some patients the onset of primary
sclerosing cholangitis may precede the symptoms of colitis by
up to four years. The outcome of the hepatobiliary disease is
completely unrelated to the activity, severity, or clinical
course of the colitis. This is borne out by the fact that
colectomy makes no difference to the clinical progression or
mortality of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis."
Indeed, liver disease may develop some years after a total
colectomy has been performed.3 12 The increased frequency
of bile duct cancer, including carcinoma of the gall bladder,
in patients with ulcerative colitis is well established,'3 14 with
an estimated prevalence rate of 0.5%. It is also clear that
adenocarcinoma of the biliary system may develop in patients
with longstanding either large or small duct primary scleros￾ing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis.3 '1 It is possible that all
patients with ulcerative colitis who develop biliary cancer
have underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis.
There are fewer reports of primary sclerosing cholangitis
associated with Crohn's disease, and the prevalence of bile
duct carcinoma is not increased in Crohn's disease. '4 The
explanation for these apparent differences in prevalence
between the two diseases is unclear.

Aetiology
The cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown, but
any proposed aetiological factors must explain the close
association with ulcerative colitis. Consequently, a number
of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association
between colonic disease and biliary tract fibrosis, including
ascending portal infection and abnormal bile acid
metabolism.'7 However, there is no evidence in favour of
these aetiologies.'8 23
Ludwig et all9 suggested that primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis may be caused by a virus since cholangitis and biliary
atresia may be induced in weanling mice, primates, and
possibly also in human infants after infection with reovirus
type III.24 Serological studies25 have not shown any evidence
of past or current infection with this virus, although other
viruses may be involved.
Recent studies have suggested that genetic and immuno￾logical factors are important. Three sets of siblings from
three families have been reported with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and ulcerative colitis.26 The frequency of HLA
B8, DR3 is much higher in primary sclerosing cholangitis
patients than in control subjects.2728 This finding not only
confirms the role of genetic factors but also suggests that the
disease may be immunologically mediated, as the HLA B8/
DR3 phenotype is associated with a number of autoimmune
diseases such as autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, myaes￾thenia gravis, and thyrotoxicosis. Although the prevalence of
HLA B8 DR3 is not increased in patients with ulcerative
colitis, such a patient who is unfortunate enough to possess
the HLA, B8, DR3 phenotype has a 10 fold increase in the
relative risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis.
These findings have been extended by the recent report of
Prochazka et al.29 These workers found that 100% of 29
primary sclerosing cholangitis patients referred for hepatic
transplantation possessed the HLA-DRw52a antigen, which
is on the DR3 B chain. This may represent the specific site on
the HLA molecule related to the susceptibility to primary
sclerosing cholangitis.
The possible importance of immunological factors has
been emphasised by the number of recent reports that have
shown humoral and cellular abnormalities in primary scleros￾ing cholangitis. The cellular immune abnormalities include
low values of circulating suppressor T cells in serum,30 and
large increases in the numbers of both suppressor and helper
T cells in the portal tracts in patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis,3' an inhibition of leukocyte migration in
response to biliary antigens,32 and aberrant expression of
HLA DR antigens on biliary epithelium at early stages of the
disease.33 Humoral immune defects include increased values
of circulating immune complexes in blood,34 defective clear￾ance of immune complexes,35 activation of the complement
system,36 and circulating antibodies against neutrophil
nuclei.37
Current evidence suggests that primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis is an immunologically mediated disease, probably
triggered in genetically susceptible subjects by acquired toxic
or infectious agents that may gain access through the colon.
Natural history and prognosis
Recent studies have confirmed earlier reports23 that sympto￾matic primary sclerosing cholangitis is often a severe progres￾sive liver disease. This is borne out by the fact that it is one
of the most common indications for transplantation. The
average time between the onset of symptoms and death is
approximately seven years with a range of 6 months - 15
years. In a study of 29 symptomatic patients, Lebovics et al
found that 41% died or developed liver failure requiring liver
transplantation during a mean follow up of 6-3 years.38
Similarly, the largest report from the Mayo Clinic found that
49% of 137 symptomatic patients died or developed liver
failure during a mean follow up of 6.2 years.39
Most symptomatic patients die in hepatic failure after
deepening cholestatic jaundice. However, approximately
20-30% of patients with longstanding primary sclerosing
cholangitis die from the development of bile duct cancer
which often follows a very aggressive course. Unfortunately,
no risk factors which predict the primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis patients who will develop carcinoma have been
identified.
With the advent of liver transplantation, it has become
important to identify prognostic factors to predict the risk of
progression to liver failure and death. These factors would be
useful in deriving survival models which can be used to
identify individual primary sclerosing cholangitis patients at
low, moderate, and high risk. A number of these models have
already been constructed for primary biliary cirrhosis. Un￾fortunately, studies from different units have provided
conflicting results. The Yale study was the first to use
multivariate analysis.' This showed that hepatomegaly and a
serum bilirubin concentration >25 mmol/l were the only
independent discriminators of a poor prognosis.40 In contrast,
the Mayo Clinic, also using multivariate analysis, found that
age, serum bilirubin concentration, blood haemoglobin
concentration, presence or absence of inflammatory bowel
disease, and histological stage on liver biopsy were indepen￾dent predictors of high risk of dying.42 To add to the
confusion, the Royal Free group identified serum bilirubin,
age, and the site of biliary involvement as indicators of a poor
prognosis, whereas disease localised to the intrahepatic ducts
was associated with a favourable outcome.4' The message
from these variable results is that larger multicentre studies
are needed.
The natural history of asymptomatic patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis is less clearcut. The diagnosis is made
incidentally when a persistently raised alkaline phosphate
activity is discovered, usually in a patient with ulcerative
colitis. There has been controversy as to the relative number
of asymptomatic patients who will progress and the rate of
progression to symptomatic chronic liver disease. The Yale
group described 11 asymptomatic primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis patients observed for a mean follow up period of three
years43: none of this small group developed symptoms. In
addition, Aadland et al reported that 27 asymptomatic or
minimally asymptomatic patients followed for a mean of 4-4
years showed no evidence of progression of liver disease.42
Both studies were in keeping with an earlier report that
primary sclerosing cholangitis may remain asymptomatic for
many years.
A recent report from the Mayo Clinic describes the
progress of 45 asymptomatic patients followed for a median
period of 75 months.' Thirty four (76%) developed evidence
of disease progression and 14 (31%) developed liver failure
that resulted in death or referral for liver transplantation.
These results were in agreement with the Royal Free group
who reported 17 asymptomatic patients; 10 (59%) showed
4'1 clinical progression over a mean of three years.
How can these studies be equated? The Mayo Clinic and
Royal Free Hospital are tertiary referral centres and, inevit￾ably, new asymptomatic patients will be referred at a later
stage in their disease process. Our own unpublished observa￾tions show that about one third of 35 asymptomatic patients
have developed symptoms and two patients have died over a
median follow up of five years. On balance, it seems that most
asymptomatic patients will progress but that there may well
be a subset who do not progress clinically over many years.
As yet there are no risk factors that have been identified to
predict which asymptomatic patients will go on to develop
liver failure or cholangiocarcinoma. In the light of potential

therapeutic intervention further studies are needed in this
important area.
Conclusion
The last decade has seen major advances in our understand￾ing in all aspects of primary sclerosing cholangitis. It is to be
hoped that the next 10 years will be equally productive and
indicate the infectious or toxic agent which triggers the
immune mediated biliary destruction in genetically sus￾ceptible subjects. Undoubtedly, accurate survival models
will be developed from multicentre data which will allow
optimal timing of medical therapy and liver transplantation.
In addition, further studies will be needed to predict which
patients are at risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
