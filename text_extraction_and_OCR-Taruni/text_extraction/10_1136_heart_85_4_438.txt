Abstract
OBJECTIVE To predict the growth in demand for long term follow
up of adults with congenital heart disease.


DESIGN Observed diagnoses of congenital heart disease in infancy
and childhood were adjusted for observed infant survival, predicted
further survival to age 16 years, underascertainment in older
childhood, and predicted need for long term follow up.
SETTING The resident population of one health region in the UK.
PATIENTS All confirmed cardiovascular malformations diagnosed
in 1985 to 1999 in children born in 1985 to 1994.
RESULTS 1942 cases of congenital heart disease were diagnosed in
infancy in a population of 377 310 live births (5.2/1000). 1588
(82%) survived to 1 year and 1514 were predicted to survive to age
16. 605 further diagnoses were made in childhood—678 when
adjusted for underascertainment. Thus, 2192 children were
predicted to reach age 16, of whom 784 would require long term
follow up in adult life. The adult population would comprise 28%
complex, 54% significant, and 18% minor congenital heart disease.
These figures predict the need for adult follow up of congenital
heart disease of over 200 extra cases per 100 000 live births each
year or over 1600 extra cases a year every year in the UK.
CONCLUSIONS The need for follow up of congenital heart disease
in adult life is likely to grow linearly, with increasing complexity
and increasing need for reinvestigation and reintervention with
time. Appropriate provision should be made for adequate
manpower, resources, and facilities for care of these patients.
