A B S T R A C T The purpose of the present experi￾ments was to evaluate the role of circulating antibodies
in the rejection of human renal allografts and to study
the apparent target(s) for antibody binding. Eluates ob￾tained from surgical biopsy and nephrectomy speci￾mens of rejecting, cadaveric human renal allografts
were tested for antibodies directed to structural
antigens of normal kidney and for cytotoxic antibody
activity against mononuclear cell populations. By in￾direct immunofluorescence 23 of 35 eluates contained
immunoglobulin that bound to normal kidney. Staining
was in smooth muscle only in 10 patients, in smooth
muscle and other structures such as tubular basement
membranes, proximal cells, or brush border in 9 pa￾tients, and in structures other than smooth muscle in
4 patients. All 16 eluates tested contained antibodies
cytotoxic for cells derived from a panel of normal
volunteers. Six were cytotoxic to T cells and 10 to B
cell and monocyte-enriched preparations. Absorption
of eluates with pooled buffy coat cells, platelet
concentrates and packed, cultured B cells removed
antibodies reactive with vascular wall smooth muscle
and endothelium, but not antibodies to tubular base￾ment membranes, proximal or distal tubular cells,
brush border, or other structures of kidney sections.
Two of five eluates containing antikidney antibodies
were found to bind to rat kidneys in vivo. These
results suggest that circulating antibodies participate
in cadaveric renal allograft destruction and dem￾onstrate that they can be recovered directly from
the allograft. Moreover, the data indicate that there

are different antibody populations involved: some
clearly directed to allo-specific differences and others
that are apparently kidney-specific.
INTRODUCTION
Although participation of antibodies in the destruction
of initial renal allografts in some experimental models
is well demonstrated (1, 2), the importance of anti￾bodies in human renal allograft rejection has not been
defined clearly (2). They are thought to play a pivotal
role in hyperacute rejection, associated with recipient
presensitization and demonstrable reactivity with
donor cells (3-5). Moreover, their participation has
been implicated in the development of vascular lesions
conspicuous in later rejections (6, 7). Data establish￾ing the relationship of circulating antibodies to graft
fate in man are largely circumstantial, and include
disappearance from circulation of preexisting anti￾bodies when graft is placed, the appearance or rise
in titer of antibodies after graft removal, develop￾ment of rheumatoid factor and heterophile antibodies
(8, 9) and deposition of immunoglobulin in vascular
lesions, glomeruli, and tubulo-interstitial areas (7, 10).
Stronger evidence has been adduced by analysis of
eluates from renal allografts at nephrectomy or autopsy
(11-18). Nevertheless, results have not been con￾sistently positive for evidence of antibodies bound to
grafts, and no studies of specificities of these eluates
toward intrarenal structures have been reported.

bodies have been eluted from allografts placed into pa￾tients with circulating GBM antibodies (19), and tubular
basement membrane (TBM) antibodies have been
eluted from occasional allografts with apparent in vivo
fixation of immunoglobulins (Ig) seen by direct im￾munofluorescent (IF) tests on renal tissue (20-22).
The frequency of anti-TBM antibodies has not been
studied, and there has been no systematic investiga￾tion searching for other structurally-specific antibodies
in a group of rejecting (rejected) renal allografts.
The present studies of eluates from cadaveric renal
allografts with marked deterioration of renal function
or irreversible clinical rejection were undertaken for
three purposes: (a) to determine the presence of anti￾tissue antibodies in eluates from such grafts; (b) to
characterize apparent antitissue antibodies for struc￾tural and organ specificity; and (c) to test these eluates
concomitantly for their content of cytotoxic antibodies
to different mononuclear cell populations (T cell,
B cell, and monocytes).
Our results indicate that all eluates from rejecting
cadaveric human renal allografts tested contained anti￾bodies cytotoxic to allogeneic mononuclear cell pop￾ulations. In addition, most contained antibodies with
apparent specificity for structural antigens of normal,
human kidney; some of these could be absorbed with
peripheral blood buffy coat, platelets, and/or B cell-rich
preparations. However, several ofthe eluates tested con￾tained substantial concentrations of antibodies which
appear to bind only to kidney. Absorption experi￾ments and paired label, in vivo, fixation studies in rats
indicated that these antibodies against specific kidney
structures are a population of antibodies distinct and
separable from the antibodies cytotoxic for defined
mononuclear cell populations.
METHODS
Kidney specimens were obtained from cadaveric allografts
placed into 35 recipients (group I). The specimens investi￾gated included 17 surgical biopsies obtained from grafts
showing serious deterioration of function and 25 nephrec￾tomies obtained after irreversible rejection. All patients
were still on standard immunosuppression at the time of
biopsy or nephrectomy. No patients had received anti￾lymphocyte globulin. No instances of "hyperacute" rejec￾tion are included and neither are any apparent cases of tech￾nical failure, tubular necrosis, etc. As controls, native
kidneys were obtained by nephrectomy from 11 patients
anticipating renal allografts (group II); 3 of the 11 later had
allograft nephrectomy and are included in group I. These
11 patients had: glomerulonephritis (seven cases), focal
sclerosing glomerulopathy, interstitial nephritis, nephro￾sclerosis, and reflux nephropathy (one case each); 9/11 had
glomerular Ig deposits. None of the tissues tested were from
patients with GBM antibody-mediated disease as inferred
from direct IF, and tests of sera and eluates for GBM
antibodies. One eluate of group II was known to contain
antibodies specific for vascular smooth muscle.
Antibodies. Antisera to human immunoglobulins were
made in rabbits using fractions of normal human serum
or myeloma proteins as described previously (23). Antisera
to human renal tubular antigen and Tamm-Horsfall protein
used as localization markers for tissue studies were made
similarly, using antigens isolated as described by Edgington
and associates (24) and Hoyer et al. (25), respectively.
Fluoresceination of globulin fractions was done by the
method of Clark and Shepard (26).
Elution procedure. Cortical segments were minced and
washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4;
the 1,000 g sediment was eluted with 0.02 M citrate pH 3.2
at 37°C for 2.5 h with constant stirring (23). After centrifuga￾tion at 4,000 g for 30 min in the cold, the supernate
was neutralized, dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buff￾ered saline, and concentrated by ultrafiltration before testing.
Quantitative Ig concentrations. Quantitative Ig concen￾trations were measured by radial immunodiffusion using
commercial kits (Hyland Diagnostics Div., Travenol Labo￾ratories, Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif.; Meloy Laboratories, Inc.,
Springfield, Va.). Total Ig concentrations (text and Table I)
comprise the sum of individually measured IgG, IgM,
and IgA.
Radiolabeling. Proteins were labeled with 1311 or 1251 by
the technique of McConahey and Dixon (27); counting was
done in a well detector with thallium-activated crystal.
Anti-GBM antibodies. Anti-GBM antibodies were as￾sayed in serum and eluates by indirect IF and radio￾assay (28).
IF. Direct IF tests oftissue were done using incident-light
fluorescence microscopy and conventional controls (23, 28).
For indirect IF using sera and eluates, samples were tested at
known Ig concentrations. Cryostat sections were treated as
described (28), first with serum or eluates and subsequently
with fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG and FII fraction
of human serum proteins reagent (anti-human Ig). Controls for
indirect IF included incubation of sections (a) with normal
human serum, (b) with sham eluates made from incubating
normal human autopsy kidney with normal human serum fol￾lowed by elution procedure, and (c) with acid-citrate treated
human IgG. The binding specificity of all eluates was tested
by IF individually on multiple normal kidneys (NHK) includ￾ing kidney from blood group 0 donors; in comparative experi￾ments in which all, or a representative number of eluates were
tested simultaneously, the same target substrate was used.
The apparent amount of antibodies contained in eluates and
binding to structural components of NHK by IF was estimated
by two methods: (a) titer of antibody binding per microgram of
IgG compared with concomitantly collected serum titer per
microgram of IgG; such ratios always refer to antibodies with
the same binding pattern; (b) minimal absolute eluate IgG
concentration associated with demonstrable binding by IF.
To determine organ specificity, binding to nonrenal, human
tissues was investigated. Eluates were incubated with sections
of human tissues obtained freshly from surgical biopsy and/or
autopsy including: heart, thyroid, lung, liver, spleen, testicle,
skeletal muscle, adrenal, pancreas, stomach, gut, and lymph
node. The IF staining technique was the same as that used
with kidney sections.
A number of eluates known to bind to NHK were absorbed
with either pooled whole human leukocytes (buffy coat),
pooled, washed human platelets, or cultured human B cells.
For absorption the eluates were incubated with an equal
volume of packed cells, at room temperature for 1 h. After
removal ofthe cells by centrifugation the eluates were concen￾trated back to their original volume before testing.
Paired label, in vivo binding studies ofradiolabeled eluates.
Test eluates were radiolabeled with 125I or 131I, dialyzed free of
inorganic iodine, and concentrated by diafiltration. Control

proteins (either acid-citrate treated human FIl fraction or an
apparently inert transplant eluate) were labeled with the alter￾nate isotope, and prepared similarly to the test eluates. Ap￾proximately equal amounts of labeled test eluate and control
protein were mixed and injected simultaneously (1-10 x 106
dpm of each) by tail vein into two lightly anesthetized Sprague￾Dawley rats. Rats were treated with saturated solution of
potassium iodide in drinking water, housed in metabolism
cages, and killed after 72 h. At sacrifice the carcasses were
perfused with saline and excised organs counted (liver, spleen,
kidneys, skeletal muscle): kidneys were homogenized in a
mechanical blendor, debris washed with phosphate-buffered
saline; and the pellet after centrifugation at 4,000 g for 30 min
was counted. The results were expressed as percent kidney￾fixing antibody (KFab), which refers to the radioactivity fixed
to the washed, particulate kidney debris, and is calculated as
described by Lerner and Dixon (29): KFab = counts per
minute cpm kidney-fixed 125I-(blood 1251 x kidney 131I/blood
1311) cpm 1251 protein injected. Nine different transplant
eluates were studied. Three eluates of native kidneys known
to contain anti-GBM antibody were used as positive controls.
Cell preparations for cytotoxicity tests. Venous blood ob￾tained from normal volunteer donors, members of the tissue
typing laboratory reference panel, was anticoagulated with
preservative-free heparin and the mononuclear cells were
isolated on Ficoll-Hypaque (30). After centrifugation at 400 g
for 30 min at room temperature the mononuclear cells obtained
from the interf;ace were washed once with RPMI 1640 medium
containing 20% pooled human serum and suspended in the
same.
Monocytes were isolated by adherence. For this, 20-30
x 106 mononuclear cells were cultured in 25 ml of medium in
a 10-cm Diam dish at 37°C in a humid atmosphere containing
5% C02, 95% air. After about 2 h the nonadherent cells were
removed by washing with culture medium, checking for com￾pleteness of their removal with an inverted phase microscope.
It usually required five or six washes of 8-10 ml each for
removal of lymphocytes. The adherent cells were then re￾leased from the dish by gently scraping the surface with a
sterile rubber policeman. The cells were collected in a conical
centrifuge tube containing RPMI 1640 with 20% pooled hu￾man serum and washed once. The resulting cell preparations
were usually 75-95% viable. About 80% of the cells showed
characteristics of monocytes upon staining with euchrysine
and ingested latex particles.
B lymphocytes were obtained from the nonadherent cells
by removal of T lymphocytes with neuraminidase-treated
sheep erythrocytes: nonadherent lymphocytes were mixed
with an equal volume of 2% neuraminidase-treated sheep
erythrocytes (31), incubated at 37°C for 15 min in a water bath
with shaking, underlayered with Ficoll-Hypaque solution and
refrigerated at 4°C for 30 min to allow the formation of
rosettes. The preparations were then centrifuged at 400 g for
30 min and the B lymphocytes removed from interface were
washed once and adjusted to 3 x 106 per ml. The B lympho￾cyte preparations usually contained <5% rosette-forming
cells. Less than 10% reacted with a rabbit anti-human T
cell serum; 70-95% were killed by a rabbit anti-human
Ia serum.
T lymphocytes were prepared from the sheep cell rosettes
by hypotonic lysis. Having discarded the supernatant fluid,
the erythrocyte pellets containing the T lymphocytes were
suspended in 1-2 ml ofTris-ammonium chloride solution (32)
and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The tubes were filled with
saline solution and the T lymphocyte recovered by centrifuga￾tion. T lymphocyte preparations usually showed < 10% killing
with a rabbit anti-human Ia serum and 80-85% were killed by
a rabbit anti-human T cell serum.
Cytotoxicity tests. Cytotoxicity tests were performed
using the Standard National Institutes of Health procedure for
microcytotoxicity (33). 16 different allograft eluates, selected
because of the differing specificities they had in IF binding
assays and sufficient eluate was available were tested. In
these tests we used 2,000 T cells, and 3,000 B cells or mono￾cytes and 0.001 ml of eluate or serum. The T cell preparations
were incubated for 30 min with eluate or serum and 60 min
with rabbit complement, both at room temperature. The B cell
and monocyte cytotoxicity tests were incubated at 20°C for 60
min with eluate or serum and for an additional 120 min after
addition of rabbit complement; rabbit complement was pre￾tested to insure potency and lack of toxicity to human lympho￾cytes and monocytes. After the final incubation the reaction
droplets were stained with eosin and fixed with formalin. The
reading of the results were performed in an inverted phase
contrast microscope. The coding was as follows: <10% dead
cells, negative; 10-30% cells killed, questionable negative;
30-50% cells dead, questionable positive, 50-80%, definite
positive; and >80% killed, strong positive. Each eluate was
tested against cell preparations from 14-18 different donors.
As control, 11 native kidney eluates were tested similarly.
RESULTS
Binding to NHK. 12 allograft eluates had no des￾cernible Ig binding to NHK by IF assay; 7 were from
biopsy specimens and did not contain detectable Ig
(<50 ,ug/ml). The other five were nephrectomy eluates
with Ig concentrations of 150-270 ,tg/ml. Eluates from
23 allografts contained Ig which bound to specific struc￾tural components of homologous kidney (Table I). At
least seven different patterns of IF staining were de￾fined by these tests (Figs. 1-5). They consisted ofIg bind￾ing to: smooth muscle, endothelium, proximal tubular
cells, proximal tubular brush border, a granular cyto￾plasmic antigen associated with basal lamina of proxi￾mal tubular cells, distal tubule and/or collecting duct
cells, and cortical TBM. No instances of GBM binding
were seen. The positive eluates comprised three
groups: (a) binding to vascular smooth muscle only (10
patients), (b) binding to vascular smooth muscle and to
other structural components (9 patients), and (c) bind￾ing to structures other than vascular smooth muscle
only (4 patients). In contrast, only 1 of 11 eluates from
native, diseased kidneys (group II) contained anti￾bodies specific for vascular smooth muscle. The other
10 eluates from native kidneys were negative. More￾over, all 11 were negative against all other NHK target
sites. In three patients eluates from native kidneys
were negative for smooth muscle antibodies, whereas
their allografts contained them.
Quantitation of antibodies against specific kidney
structures. Sera drawn from 18 patients at time of
graft nephrectomy were tested along with their graft
eluates. Serum from five patients contained antibodies
with specificities similar to their graft eluates and
eluates/serum ratios could be estimated: titration results
of serum and eluate suggested preferential uptake of
structurally-specific antibody by allografts in four ofthe

five (eluates 11-14). Eluates from 14 patients contained
antibodies not found in their serum. Titration of all
eluates to the minimal Ig concentration at which spe￾cific staining could be seen confidently showed it to
vary from 2.7 to 670,g/ml (median 62 ,ug/ml); in 14 of
the 25 eluates tested binding was observed at Ig con￾centrations < 100 ,ug/ml (11 < 50 ,ug/ml) indicating that
major amounts of structurally specific antibodies were
present. IgG titers were not significantly different than
FII fraction of human protein titers.
Binding to nonrenal, human tissue sections. 10
eluates were tested. Eluates which contained anti￾bodies to vascular smooth muscle of homologous kid￾ney bound also to smooth muscle of stomach and gut,
and to cardiac but not skeletal muscle. On the other
hand, eluates containing antibodies to tubule cells and
TBM did not stain other tissues, with one exception: Ig
in one eluate bound also to pancreatic duct cells (not
muscle cells). The single native kidney eluate with
smooth muscle antibodies bound only to vascular
smooth muscle, and did not cross-react with visceral
smooth, cardiac, or skeletal muscle.
Absorption experiments. Whole buffy coat, pooled
platelet concentrates, and pooled, cultured B-cell con￾centrates were equally effective in absorption of anti￾bodies with apparent specificity for smooth muscle cells
of homologous kidney and endothelium. However,
none of these cell preparations diminished or elimi￾nated binding to other structural antigens such as
tubule cells, brush border, or TBM (Table II).
Paired label, in vivo studies of radiolabeled eluates.
Nine allograft eluates were tested: two showed clear

binding to renal tissue in excess of 1% (eluates 15 and
17, Table III). Precipitation of immunoglobulin from
the eluates before injection diminished renal binding
substantially, but absorption of eluates with pooled
human platelets and B-cell rich concentrates did not
alter binding. Positive-control eluates used in these
studies were three different native kidney eluates from
patients with anti-GBM antibody-mediated disease;
they had binding of 0.8-4.4% to renal sediment. Two
other transplant eluates (eluates 11 and 22) showed
smaller binding of uncertain significance.
Cytotoxic antibody reactivity. All eluates tested
had cytotoxic reactivity toward one or more cell popu￾lations. In general, those eluates (eluates 4,5, 12, 14,20,
27) that contained antibodies reactive with T cells also
were cytotoxic to B cells, but seldom with a predomi￾nantly monocyte-enriched cell population (Table IV), K
and tended to be more reactive. In contrast, those
eluates essentially unreactive with T cells tended to be
as reactive with monocytes as with B cell preparations.
Cytotoxic antibodies against the B cell-enriched prep￾arations coexisted with structural antibodies of all spec￾ificities, particularly smooth muscle antibodies. Serum
from nine patients taken at the time of nephrectomy
were tested also and the specificities differed from the
eluates in seven (Table IV). The 11 eluates from native
kidneys contained only two reactors: one was T + B
+ M +, and the other had mild reactivity to mono￾cytes only.

Direct immunofluorescent tests of allograft biopsy
and nephrectomy specimens. Tissue from two speci￾mens was technically faulty, presumably due to im￾proper freezing and hence, could not be evaluated.
Vascular Ig deposits were detected in 15 grafts by direct
IF; eluates from 10 of them contained antibodies to
smooth muscle, whereas 5 did not. Conversely, eluates
from 19 patients contained smooth muscle antibodies;
direct IF of kidney tissue showed vascular Ig infiltrates
in 10, glomerular staining in 4, no staining of vessels in
7 and was technically faulty in 2 (above). Staining de￾tected Ig fixed to tubules in eight allografts: TBM (five
cases), proximal tubule cells (four cases), brush border
(two cases); all eluates from these kidneys contained
antibodies that fixed to comparable structures when
tested by indirect IF on NHK sections. Significant
glomerular Ig deposits were detected by direct IF tests
of seven renal allografts; no eluate contained specific
glomerular-fixing antibodies.
DISCUS SION
FIGURE 1 Eluate Ig binding to arterial vascular smooth

mononuclear cells and by platelets, suggesting that they
are directed towards determinants also represented on
cells other than those of blood vessels.
Organ-specific antibodies binding structural anti￾gens not shared with vascular components were de￾tected in 12 eluates: they included tubule cells, brush
border, and TBM. These antibodies did not react with
sections oftissues other than kidney and were therefore
thought to be organ-specific. They were not absorbed
by concentrates of platelets or mononuclear cells;
hence, they do not seem to be HLA or Ia-related. TBM
antibodies can be absorbed, and their binding blocked,
by solubilized TBM antigen in vitro, attesting to their
relative structural specificity (21, 22).
To define the pathophysiologic significance of anti￾tissue antibodies we tried to estimate their relative con￾centration in serum and tissue eluates. On the basis of
dilutional indirect IF binding tests on homologous kid￾ney sections, we estimated that half of the eluates con￾tained anti-structural antibodies at concentrations <50
,ug of Ig per ml, suggesting an important concentration
of antibodies. For comparison, eluates from native kid￾FIGURE 3 Eluate Ig binding to tubular basement membrane

rejected) cardaveric human renal allografts: cytotoxic
antibodies to mononuclear cells and antibodies with
specificity for structural kidney antigens demonstrable
by immunofluorescence. Cytotoxic antibodies against
isolated mononuclear cells were detected in every
eluate tested. Specificities of the eluted antibodies
often differed substantially and unpredictably from
serum antibodies. Presumably eluates reflect a subset
of antibodies that bound to donor kidney over a period
oftime, whereas serum contains antibodies that did not
bind to donor kidney and only those present at the time
the sample was obtained. Thus, differences in the reac￾tions of eluates and serum samples are not surprising.
In two thirds of eluates (23/35) antibodies to structural
kidney antigens were detected by immunofluorescence;
most common were antibodies to smooth muscle (19 of
23 eluates). These antibodies bound to vascular smooth
muscle on homologous kidney sections, but reacted
also with smooth muscle of other organs, binding to
stomach, gut, and heart, but not to skeletal muscle.
Thus, they were not organ-specific. Additionally, these
antismooth muscle antibodies were absorbed by viable

neys ofpatients with GBM-antibody-induced glomeru￾lonephritis, contained antibodies demonstrable to a
concentration of approximately 9 ,ug of Ig per ml by the
same technique (23). The existence of substantial anti￾body gradients between eluates and serum at the time
of nephrectomy or biopsy in 4 out of 5 patients, and
antibodies eluted without detectable serum antibodies
in 14 of the others tested, indicated that eluted anti￾body was not present from nonspecific trapping.

Cytotoxic reactions were coded positive if at least 50% of the cells were killed. For statistical purposes
an eluate was considered positive for a certain type of reactivity only when such reactivity was seen with
cells from at least two donors.
with structural antibody content did not show con￾vincing binding. In the present experiments, when
labelled GBM-antibody eluates were tested in rats, the
range of binding was from 0.8 to 4.4% KFab (Table
III). Importantly, absorption of the eluates with human
platelets and B cell-rich preparations did not alter their
kidney binding in vivo.
There is little doubt that these antitissue antibodies
resulted from transplantation; only one eluate from
native nephritic kidneys (group II) contained antivas￾cular smooth muscle antibodies, and three allograft
eluates which contained antitissue antibodies were
from recipients whose native kidney eluates had not
contained them. Nevertheless, the precise mode of
elicitation of the structurally-specific antibodies is not
clear. Three major possibilities exist: (a) The allograft
may carry an array of structural antigens in which the
recipient is deficient. A similar mechanism has been
demonstrated when Brown Norway (BN) rat kidneys
were grafted into Lewis (LE) recipients (34). Because
LE strain lacks some structural antigens carried by BN
donors, recipients develop anti-TBM antibodies which
fix to BN (graft) kidney but not to LE (recipient) kid￾neys. In other experiments, Wilson and associates (21)
reported studies of TBM antibodies eluted from a
human renal allograft which did not react with the
patient's native kidney-a situation analogous to the rat
allografts. Further, Mancilla-Jimenez and co-workers
(22) have described an eluate containing TBM anti￾bodies that bound to TBM of 39/40 human kidneys
tested. (2) Widespread damage to renal cortical struc￾tures occurring in the course of allograft rejection may
give rise to altered structural antigens that elicit produc￾tion of antitissue antibodies. Such a sequence has been
inferred in native kidneys in unusual, but well-docu￾mented nephritis complicated by anti-TBM antibodies
(35-37) and antibodies reactive with proximal tubular
antigens (38). (3) The immune response, involving
production of cytotoxic antibodies towards various cell
populations and organ-specific, antistructural anti￾bodies, may be more characteristic of the repertoire of
available responses ofthe host than due to specific anti￾genic challenge.
The frequency ofstructurally-specific antibodies par￾ticipating in pathophysiologic events characterized
clinically as allograft "rejection" cannot be estimated
accurately from our data for two principal reasons: (a)
our observations derive from analyses of organs whose
deterioration was sufficiently serious and sustained that
biopsy or nephrectomy was done; (b) our data are
derived from cadaveric grafts. The extent to which
similar mechanisms participate in living, related-donor
graft injury is not clear.
These observations are important in several regards.
1412 J. J. McPhaul, Jr., P. Stastny, and R. B. Freeman

First, cytotoxic antibodies were eluted successfully in
every instance in this series ofrejecting renal allografts.
Moreover, two thirds of the eluates contained anti￾bodies apparently reactive against smooth muscle of
vascular walls, and some with endothelium, suggesting
the involvement of humorl antibody in vascular lesions
observed in renal allografts. Additionally, the eluates
contained a variety of structurally-specific antibodies.
Although TBM antibodies have been reported before
in renal allografts recipients (20, 22, 34), in the present
series 22% of the eluates with antitissue antibodies
contained TBM antibodies alone or in association with
other structural specificities -a surprising frequency.
Antibodies with apparent specificity for smooth
muscle were detected in seven eluates, although no
vascular Ig was detected by direct IF examination of
the same kidneys. This disparity may be due to the seg￾mental variation of pathologic processes which charac￾terizes modified graft rejections. Another possibility is
that elution, concentrating available antibodies into a
small volume for testing, enhanced the likelihood of
their detection. Mean minimal Ig concentrations at
which smooth muscle antibodies were detected was
127,ug/ml (median concentration 71 ug/ml) in eluates
from kidneys where direct IF was positive and 299
,ug/ml (median concentration 136,ug/ml) in eluates from
IF negative kidneys, suggesting that lesser amounts of
smooth muscle antibody were present in the latter
eluates. On the other hand, vascular Ig deposits were
seen by direct IF without smooth muscle or endothelial
antibodies in eluates in five cases. Similar vascular Ig
deposits have been seen in renal biopsies from patients
with arterial hypertension, where they have been at￾tributed to insudation by passive forces or nonspecific
vascular injury and not to immunological mechanisms.
There has not been any previous report of allografts
with specific uptake of antiproximal cell antibodies, al￾though an instance with Fanconi syndrome may have
occurred in native kidney disease (38). Autoantibodies
to cells of Henle's loop have been detected in sero￾logical surveys and in serum ofpatients reported to have
renal tubular acidosis (39, 40), but have not been
demonstrated immunopathologically to bind in vivo.
Our results, indicating binding in vivo, suggest that
such antibodies may have a pathophysiologic role in
human disease, and may be relevant to renal tubular
functional derangements reported in patients with
renal allografts (41).
The high frequency of eluted antibodies reacting
mostly with B lymphocytes is of considerable interest.
It has been reported that antibodies to B lymphocytes
appear in the serum of patients rejecting kidney allo￾grafts but their role in rejection has not been established
(42). Garavoy and coworkers (13) eluted kidney allo￾grafts undergoing rejection and reported finding a factor
capable of inhibiting Fc receptors, thought to be anti￾bodies against Ia-like antigens, but the specificity ofthe
factor(s) involved was not established. Moraes and
Stastny (43) have reported that certain antibodies
against alloantigens of endothelial cells found in sera
from transplant recipients react also with monocytes.
However, since both cells also appear to have HLA-DR
antigens, the specificity of the monocyte cytotoxic anti￾bodies observed in the present study is not yet known.
We infer from our investigations that there was evi￾dence of multifaceted humoral antibody participation
in the pathogenic events involved in renal allograft
deterioration of the patients we have studied. The rela￾tive impact of two kinds of antibody systems (cytotoxic
and antitissue antibodies), contrasted to primary cellu￾lar immune mechanisms, cannot be established from
our observations. The more consistent detection of
cytotoxic antibodies in the eluates tested suggests that
they may be the more important antibody expression of
graft-directed humoral immunity. Further studies will
be needed to characterize the antigens involved and to
quantify the in vitro activity and pathogenic significance
of antibodies that can be eluted from allografts under￾going rejection.
