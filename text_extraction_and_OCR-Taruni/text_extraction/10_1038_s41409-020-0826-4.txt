Abstract
Hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) is widely used for acquired and congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system.
Number of transplants performed in Europe and associated countries continues to rise with 47,468 HCT in 42,901 patients
[19,630 allogeneic (41%) and 27,838 autologous (59%)] reported by 701 centers in 50 countries in 2018. Main indications
were myeloid malignancies 10,679 (25%; 97% allogeneic), lymphoid malignancies 27,318 (64%; 20% allogeneic), solid
tumors 1625 (4%; 2.9% allogeneic), and nonmalignant disorders 3063 (7%; 81% allogeneic). This year’s analysis focuses on
cellular therapies with the marked growth in CAR T-cell therapies from 151 in 2017 to 301 patients reported in 2018. Other
cellular therapy numbers show less significant changes. Important trends in HCT include a 49% increase in allogeneic HCT
for chronic phase CML (although transplant numbers remain low) and a 24% increase in aplastic anemia. In autologous
HCT, there is an ongoing increase in autoimmune diseases (by 19%), predominantly due to activity in multiple sclerosis.
This annual report reflects current activity and highlights important trends, useful for health care planning.
Introduction
Hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) is an established
procedure for many inherited or acquired disorders of the
hematopoietic system, whether benign or neoplastic,
including those of the immune system, and as enzyme
replacement in metabolic disorders [1–3]. The activity

survey of the European Society of Blood and Marrow
Transplantation (EBMT), describing the status of HCT in
Europe and affiliated countries, has become an instrument
to observe trends and to monitor changes in the technology
in Europe and neighboring countries [4–14]. The survey
using a standardized structure captures the numbers of HCT
from highly committed participating teams, divided by
indication, donor type, and stem cell source. In the last years
with the dramatic increase of cellular therapies, the survey
also includes information on cellular therapies with hema￾topoietic cells for uses other than to replace the hemato￾poietic system [15–30]. The analysis of the survey data
since 1990 shows a continued and constant increase in
the annual numbers of HCT and transplant rates for both
allogeneic and autologous HCT. This report, based on the
2018 survey data, shows recent trends, changes in indica￾tions, and use in Europe and the surrounding countries.
Patients and methods
Data collection and validation
Participating teams were invited to report their data for 2018
using the activity survey as listed in Table 1. The survey
allows the possibility to report additional information on the
numbers of subsequent transplants performed due to
relapse, rejection, or those that are part of a planned
sequential transplant protocol. Information on the numbers
of patients receiving unmanipulated donor lymphocyte
infusions (DLIs), nonmyeloablative, or reduced intensity
HCT and the numbers of pediatric HCT is also collected.
In addition, centers can report information on specific
transplants involving point of care and nonsubstantial pro￾cessing of collected cells (such as immune cell selection)
and on different types of cellular therapies that qualify as
medicinal products since they result from substantial
manipulations of the collected cells, whether industry and
centrally manufactured or locally manufactured.
Quality control measures included several independent
systems: confirmation of validity of the entered data by the
reporting team, selective comparison of the survey data with
MED-A data sets in the EBMT registry database and cross￾checking with the National Registries.
Teams
A total of 721 centers from 52 countries were contacted for
the 2018 survey (43 European and 9 affiliated countries); of
which 701 teams reported. This corresponds to a 97% return
rate and includes 82% EBMT members and 18% non￾EBMT members. Twenty active teams failed to report in
2018. Reporting teams are listed in the Supplementary
online appendix in alphabetical order by country, city, and
EBMT center code, with their reported numbers of first
and total HCT, and of first allogeneic and autologous
HCT as Supplementary material. The WHO regional office
definitions were used to classify countries as European or
non-European. Nine neighboring non-European countries
participated in the 2018 EBMT survey: Algeria, Iran, Iraq,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and
Tunisia. Their data, 3650 HCT in 3436 patients, from 38
actively transplanting teams make up 7.7% of the total data
set and are included in all analyses.
Patient and transplant numbers
Wherever appropriate, patient numbers corresponding to the
number of patients receiving a first transplant in 2018, and
transplant numbers reflecting the total number of transplants
performed are listed. The term sibling donor includes HLA
identical siblings and twins but not siblings with HLA
mismatches. Unrelated donor transplants include HCT from
matched or mismatched unrelated donors with peripheral
blood and marrow as a stem cell source but not cord blood
HCT. Haploidentical transplants are being described as any
family member with two or more loci (but not more than
five) mismatches within the loci HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1,
and -DQB1 in GvH and/or HvG direction. Other family
member donors are those related donors that are mis￾matched to a lesser degree than a full haplotype. Additional
nonfirst transplants may include multiple transplants defined
as subsequent transplants within a planned double or triple
autologous or allogeneic transplant protocol, and retrans￾plants (autologous or allogeneic) defined as unplanned HCT
for rejection or relapse after a previous HCT.
Hematopoietic cellular therapies other than
hematopoietic-cell transplantation
Centers were requested to report all patients receiving
hematopoietic cellular therapies in 2018. Hematopoietic
cellular therapies were defined as infusion of cells, under￾going substantial manipulation after collection, either
selection and/or expansion, or genetic modification and
who thus qualify as investigational or approved ATMP’s
according to Regulation (EC) N° 1394/2007. In this con￾text, “substantial” should be understood as referring to the
definition included in the Regulation and subsequent reg￾ulatory documents and may not reflect the workload
assumed by cell-processing facilities working in conjunc￾tion with clinical programs. Depending on their nature and
indications, hematopoietic cellular therapies may be
designed to replace or to complement hematopoietic-cell
transplants. Administration of nonsubstantially manipulated
hematopoietic cells, such as transplantation of CD34+

selected hematopoietic stem cells is counted as HCT and
not as cellular therapy [15]. Similarly, unmanipulated
lymphocyte infusions post-HCT are counted as DLI and not
as cellular therapy. Hematopoietic cellular therapies include
what is defined in FACT-JACIE standards as immune
effector cells; “A cell that has differentiated into a form
capable of modulating or effecting a specific immune
response” [16, 17]. This definition covers CAR-T cells and
forms the basis for accreditation requirements in recent
EBMT-JACIE recommendations [18].
Hematopoietic cellular therapies were categorized as
chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T); in vitro selected
and/or expanded T cells or cytokine activated, such as virus￾specific T cells, cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK), reg￾ulatory T cells (TREGS), genetically modified T cells other
than CAR-T, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, mesench￾ymal stromal cells, in vitro expanded CD34+ cells, and
genetically modified CD34+ cells. This survey does not
include cells from sources other than hematopoietic tissue
[18–25]. On the other hand, gene therapy protocols, such as
those used to treat thalassemia or SCID are part of this
survey but numbers are currently very low.
Transplant rates
Transplant rates, defined as the total number of HCT per 10
million inhabitants, were computed for each country with￾out adjustments for patients who crossed borders and
received their HCT in a foreign country. Population num￾bers for the European countries in 2018 were obtained from
Eurostats: (http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu) and from the
World Bank database for the non-European countries:
(https://databank.worldbank.org).
Cellular therapies are shown on a map, as to where they
are performed, but as numbers are still low, rates are not
estimated.
Analysis
Wherever appropriate, the absolute numbers of transplanted
patients, transplants, or transplant rates are shown for spe￾cific countries, indications, or transplant techniques.
Myeloid malignancy includes acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), myelodysplastic or myelodysplastic/myeloproli￾ferative neoplasia (MDS or MDS/MPN overlap), myelo￾proliferative neoplasm (MPN), and chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML). Lymphoid malignancy includes acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leuke￾mia (CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL), and plasma cell disorders (PCD) (which includes
multiple myeloma (MM) and others). The non malignant
disorders include bone marrow failure (BMF) (which
includes severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and other bone
marrow failures), thalassemia and sickle cell disease (HG),
primary immune disease (PID), inherited diseases of
metabolism (IDM), and autoimmune disease (AID). Others
include histiocytosis and other rare disorders not included in
the above.
Results
Participating teams in 2018
Of the 701 teams, 456 (65%) performed both allogeneic and
autologous transplants; 222 (32%) restricted their activity to
autologous HCT, and 14 (2%) to allogeneic transplants
only. Nine of the 701 responding teams (1%) reported no
activity due to renovation or changes within the transplant
unit. Within the 692 actively transplanting centers in 2018,
119 (17%) centers performed transplants on both adult and
pediatric patients. An additional 122 (18%) centers were
dedicated pediatric transplant centers and 451 (65%) centers
perform transplants on adults only. Twenty teams failed to
report in 2018, which, when compared with previously
reported data, accounts for ~622 nonreported HCT.
Numbers of patients, transplants, and trends
In 2018, 47,468 transplants were reported in 42,901 patients
(first transplant); of these, 19,630 HCT (41%) were allogeneic
and 27,838 (59%) autologous (Table 1). When compared with
2017, the total number of transplants increased by 4.5%
(7.4% allogeneic HCT and 2.6% autologous HCT) [13]. The
corresponding number of patients showed an increase of 7.7%
for allogeneic HCT and 2.0% for autologous HCT. In addi￾tion, there were 4567 second or subsequent transplants, 1147
being allogeneic, mainly to treat relapse or graft failure and
3420 autologous, the majority of which were likely to be a
part of multiple transplant procedures, such as tandem
procedures, or as salvage autologous transplants for PCD.
Furthermore, 1002 of the allogeneic HCTs were reported as
being given after a previous autologous HCT, and were
mainly for lymphoma or PCD.
The number of pediatric patients (under the age of 18)
transplanted in both dedicated pediatric and joint
adult–pediatric units was 5368 (4075 allogeneic and 1293
autologous). This is an overall increase of 6.2%. An
increase was seen in allogeneic HCT of 9.4% and a decrease
of 3% for autologous HCT when compared with 2017,
where 5056 HCT (3725 allogeneic and 1331 autologous)
were reported. Within the 5368 patients, 4207 transplants,
and 3792 patients (2985 allogeneic; 79% and 807 auto￾logous; 21%) were performed in dedicated pediatric centers.
As seen in previous years, the increase in allogeneic HCT is
most profound in pediatric patients (total allogeneic HCT

7.4% vs 9.4% in pediatric HCT). In total 22% of allogeneic
HCT is performed in pediatric patients.
Indications for HCT in 2018 are listed in detail in Table 1
(Fig. 1a, b). Main indications for HCT were myeloid
malignancies (AML, CML, MDS or MDS/MPN overlap,
and MPN): 10,679 (97% allogeneic HCT and 2.7% auto￾logous HCT). The largest indication for allogeneic HCT is
AML, 38% of all allogeneic HCT increasing by 4% when
compared with 2017 [26]. In AML, only allogeneic HCT
in early disease stage is increasing (Fig. 2a). Among the
myeloid malignancies, CML has increased by 11% pri￾marily in patients in chronic phase (48.5%) although overall
the numbers remain low (n = 372 patients). Allogeneic
HCT for MDS also continues to increase by 13% to 2322
patients treated. ALL comprises 16% of allogeneic HCT
and showed an increase of 10.6% compared with the pre￾vious year [27]. Allogeneic HCT for CLL continues to
decrease by 16.5%, a trend continued over the last years.
Allogeneic HCT for NHL increased by 7.1% to 1366. Other
important changes include the increase in allogeneic HCT
for marrow failure, by 24% for SAA to 722 patients and by
6% to 232 patients for non-SAA marrow failure. Allogeneic
HCT for primary immune deficiency increased by 22% to
676 and for inherited disorders of metabolism by 24.5% to
198 patients. In contrast, the number of allogeneic HCT for
thalassemia and sickle cell disease appears to have stabi￾lized after the increase in 2016 and 2017.
The main indications for autologous HCT are lymphoid
malignancies (90%) with PCD comprising 54% of all
autologous HCT patients. Autologous HCT for NHL has
not changed over time and PCD has remained stable.
A decrease was seen in autologous HCT for AML by 18.6%
[28]. Overall, use of autologous HCT for AML has
decreased over several years (Fig. 2b). A continued increase
in autologous HCT for AID (19%) is observed, pre￾dominantly due to multiple sclerosis.

Within allogeneic HCT 7392 were performed using
nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning in
2018. This comprises 38% of all allogeneic HCT, and has
remained stable over the last 10 years. European maps
depicting transplant rates per 10 million population for
allogeneic and autologous HCT are provided (Fig. 3a
allogeneic HCT and 3b autologous HCT).
Donor type and stem cell source
Since 2017, the numbers of family donors continues to rise
with HLA identical sibling and syngeneic twin donors
increased by 6% and haploidentical donors by 16.3% [13].

In sibling donor transplants, the use of peripheral blood
stem cells increased by 6.7% and bone marrow stem cells
by 3.5%. In haploidentical donor transplants, a higher
increase is seen in the use of stem cells harvested from the
bone marrow; 19%, while peripheral blood stem cells
increased by 7.2% [10]. In unrelated donor transplants, the
use of bone marrow and cord blood stem cells has decreased
by 3.2% and 8.7%, respectively. However, after the slight
decrease seen in 2016, the use of peripheral blood stem cells
continues to increase again, 8% since 2017 [12]. Although
the absolute numbers have increased in both allogeneic and
autologous HCT, the proportion in use of bone marrow or
peripheral blood stem cells remains stable throughout.

2 shows immune effector cell reinfusions, including
DLI and cellular therapies performed in EBMT centers in
2018. There were 3096 patients receiving unmanipulated
DLIs in 2018, an increase of 9.6% since 2017. The majority
of DLI
’s were given for relapse (1345) and graft enhancement
(738). Figure
3c shows the rate of DLI use in European
centers, per 10 million inhabitants, re
flecting disparities in use
of this technology by geographical region.
A total of 1325 patients received other forms of hema￾topoietic cellular therapies that qualify as medicinal pro￾ducts rather than cell transplants [15]. The most widely used
cellular therapy ahead of CAR-T cells in 2018 remains
mesenchymal stromal cells (
n
= 460; 87% allogeneic), their
use being mainly to treat graft-versus-host disease and
expanded/selected T lymphocytes (
n
= 122; 98% allo￾geneic) [21]. However the most remarkable increase seen
was in gene-modi
fied T cells, notably CAR-T cells from
151 to 301 (100% increase) in patients treated in 2018.
Most other cellular therapies appear to be decreasing
slightly with exception of dendritic cells, which have
increased from 44 in 2017 to 77 (75%) in 2018.

Discussion
The EBMT activity survey has been conducted annually
since 1990 [
7]. Over 47,000 transplants in almost 43,000
patients are reported in 2018. Allogeneic HCT appears now
to expand more rapidly (7.1%) than autologous HCT
(2.4%). In pediatric patients, the trend is even more pro￾nounced, with an increase of 9.4% in allogeneic and a
decrease of 3% in autologous HCT. This has changed from
previous years where use of autologous HCT has been
expanding more rapidly. In previous years we had observed

a slower growth for unrelated donor HCT as compared for
haploidentical HCT [12]. In the last year, however, use of
both types of donors appears to increase simultaneously;
16% increase for haploidentical donors, 5% for unrelated
donors, but similar increases in absolute numbers. Indica￾tions have not changed dramatically. It is mostly in well￾established indications where growth is observed, such as
allogeneic HCT for AML in CR1 but also ALL, more so
with advanced disease than with CR1 patients [26, 27]. This
might reflect the use of new treatments in ALL, such as
bispecific antibodies or drug-conjugated antibodies, allow￾ing relapsed patients access to transplant. Use of allogeneic
HCT in CLL continues to drop reflecting the availability of
innovative-targeted drugs.
Last year, we reported lower rates of aplastic anemia
transplantation possibly due to the use of thrombopoietin
analogs such as eltrombopag. In 2018, however, we see the
number has increased by 24% compared with 2017, possi￾bly suggesting that transplants are now performed later after
failing thrombopoietin analogs. The more frequently use of
alternative donors, such as haploidentical HCT and the
more accepted indications for inherited disorders might also
explain those results. Interpretation of these trends is
obviously preliminary, as we do not have data on the use of
treatment alternatives.
The most impressive growth is observed in hemato￾poietic cellular therapies, most notably in the use of CAR-T
cells, increasing to 301 reported patients treated in 2018.
Since the only two approved products received a centralized
marketing approval from EMA in August 2018, it is
likely that the reported activity for 2018 mostly and partially
reflects clinical studies, either industry-sponsored
or academia-sponsored (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/
documents/scientific-guideline/qualification-opinion-cellula
r-therapy-module-european-society-blood-marrow-transpla
ntation-ebmt_en.pdf). Investigational CAR-T cells can be
produced by academic facilities in the context of the hos￾pital exemption, a specific provision embedded in the
Regulation (EC) 1394/2007. Emergence of a rapidly
growing clinical activity is reassuring in view of earlier
reports demonstrating that Europe lagged behind the USA
and China [29]. Autologous or allogeneic HCT for NHL has
not changed over time and use of the transplant technology
for PCD has remained stable. These are indications for
autologous as well as for allogeneic HCT which may in the
future be replaced by CAR-T treatments. Since the EMA
approved the first CAR-T product, a notable increase in the
use of CAR-T cells has been observed and a further increase
is to be expected in 2019. Hematopoietic cellular therapies
other than CAR-T are mostly decreasing. This may be due
to centers focussing more on developing CAR-T treatment
protocols, or because academic facilities that were histori￾cally involved in the development of these innovative
treatments face ever more stringent conditions for manu￾facturing, in relation with the regulatory framework and the
advent of industry-manufactured somatic cell therapy
medicinal products or gene therapy medicinal products. In
addition, our data may reflect a certain amount of under￾reporting as patients treated on trials for CAR-T cells may
not be reported in the survey due to trial regulations. The
inclusion of a Cellular Therapy Form to the EBMT registry
was a key determinant in EBMT receiving a positive opi￾nion from EMA in February 2019. This will help EBMT,
together with all interested parties, to contribute to PASS
and PAES studies, that are much needed to establish the
true medical value of these costly treatments and more
accurately define the safety profile of these gene therapy
medicinal products for which both the FDA and EMA
mandated a 15 year follow-up. The future of CAR-T ther￾apy is obviously open at this point in time given successes
[24] but also risks of failure [25].
EBMT centers will continue the well-established practice
of transparently sharing data on activity of advanced ther￾apy medicinal products manufactured from hematopoietic
cells used and on the outcome of patients. Developing high￾quality data reporting tools for novel cellular therapies will
add to the established track record of EBMT organizing
HCT teams to maximize the availability of data across the
rapidly advancing and expanding field of HCT and cellular
therapy. The annual activity survey of the EBMT reflects
current activity and trends in the field of transplant tech￾nology. It is valuable for the dissemination of the most
recent information on indications, donor and stem cell
usage, and benchmarking of data completeness, and survi￾val outcomes [30], which can ultimately be beneficial in
health care planning.
