Abstract
Apolipoprotein L-I (apoL1) is a human-specific serum protein that kills Trypanosoma brucei through ionic pore formation in
endosomal membranes of the parasite. The T. brucei subspecies rhodesiense and gambiense resist this lytic activity and can
infect humans, causing sleeping sickness. In the case of T. b. rhodesiense, resistance to lysis involves interaction of the Serum
Resistance-Associated (SRA) protein with the C-terminal helix of apoL1. We undertook a mutational and deletional analysis
of the C-terminal helix of apoL1 to investigate the linkage between interaction with SRA and lytic potential for different T.
brucei subspecies. We confirm that the C-terminal helix is the SRA-interacting domain. Although in E. coli this domain was
dispensable for ionic pore-forming activity, its interaction with SRA resulted in inhibition of this activity. Different mutations
affecting the C-terminal helix reduced the interaction of apoL1 with SRA. However, mutants in the L370-L392 leucine zipper
also lost in vitro trypanolytic activity. Truncating and/or mutating the C-terminal sequence of human apoL1 like that of
apoL1-like sequences of Papio anubis resulted in both loss of interaction with SRA and acquired ability to efficiently kill
human serum-resistant T. b. rhodesiense parasites, in vitro as well as in transgenic mice. These findings demonstrate that SRA
interaction with the C-terminal helix of apoL1 inhibits its pore-forming activity and determines resistance of T. b. rhodesiense
to human serum. In addition, they provide a possible explanation for the ability of Papio serum to kill T. b. rhodesiense, and
offer a perspective to generate transgenic cattle resistant to both T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense.

Introduction
Normal human serum (NHS) is able to kill T. b. brucei, but not T.
b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. The lytic factor was identified as
being apoL1 [1,2]. This protein is associated with HDL particles
that are efficiently taken up by the parasite through specific
binding to a haptoglobin-hemoglobin surface receptor, due to the
simultaneous presence of haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) acting
as a ligand in these particles [3]. Trypanosome lysis results from
anionic pore formation by apoL1 in the lysosomal membrane of
the parasite [4]. Resistance to lysis has only been studied in case of
T. b. rhodesiense, where it was shown to depend on a parasite protein
termed SRA [5]. As synthesis of SRA only occurs after
transcriptional activation of a given Variant Specific Glycoprotein
(VSG) gene expression site from a repertoire of 10–20 candidates,
T. b. rhodesiense clones can be either sensitive or resistant to NHS
depending on which expression site is active [2,5]. The mechanism
by which SRA inhibits the activity of apoL1 is unclear. Direct coil￾coiling interaction between the C-terminal a-helix of apoL1 and
the N-terminal a-helix of SRA was demonstrated in vitro, but in vivo
only evidence for tight co-localization between the two proteins
was obtained [1]. Total deletion of the C-terminal helix appeared
to confer toxic activity to recombinant apoL1 on T. b. rhodesiense,
suggesting that in vivo SRA neutralizes apoL1 through interaction
with its C-terminal domain [1]. However, the trypanolytic effect of
the deleted apoL1 was weak and incomplete [1]. Moreover, data
obtained following transgenic expression of a similarly truncated
apoL1 in mice suggested that its trypanolytic potential was lost in
vivo [8]. Therefore, additional work was required to evaluate if the
interaction observed in vitro was relevant for the in vivo mechanism
of T. b. rhodesiense resistance to human serum.
While human serum is unable to kill T. b. rhodesiense, the serum
of some African primates like Papio sp. was equally active on both
T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. brucei [6,7]. The phenotype of trypanolysis
by Papio serum strikingly resembled that induced by human serum,
as it was also dependent on HDL particles and was similarly
inhibited by competing amounts of haptoglobin [7]. Therefore, it
could be envisaged that in Papio, an apoL1-like protein unable to
interact with SRA would be responsible for the trypanolytic
activity of these primates. We used this working hypothesis as a
base to construct human apoL1 mutants.
We analyzed the effects of various deletions and mutations
in the C-terminal domain of apoL1 on the trypanolytic
potential of this protein against T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense.

The results confirmed the interaction model presented in [1],
as well as the role of this interaction in resistance to apoL1 in
T. b. rhodesiense. In accordance with these findings, Papio-like
apoL1 mutants able to efficiently kill both T. b. brucei and T. b.
rhodesiense were identified.
Results
Direct interaction of SRA with apoL1 inactivates the pore￾forming activity of this protein
As illustrated in Fig. 1A, apoL1 contains three functional
domains responsible for its ionic pore-forming capacity, addressing
to biological membranes and interaction with SRA, from N- to C￾terminus respectively [4].
In E. coli, the pore-forming activity of apoL1 can be measured
by the reduction of cell viability following IPTG-induced
expression of the apoL1 gene from plasmid constructs [4]. In this
system apoL1 expression closely mimicked the toxicity of the
isolated pore-forming domain of bacterial colicin A fused to the
signal peptide pelB, including depolarization of the plasma
membrane [4]. As a control, deletion of the essential helix 9 of
the pore-forming domain completely prevented this activity
(Fig. 1B). Although the pore-forming domain of apoL1 appeared
to have access to the inner membrane of E. coli, it did not appear
to be secreted as neither apoL1-expressing cells nor culture
Author Summary
The serum protein apolipoprotein L-I (apoL1) is responsi￾ble for human innate immunity against Trypanosoma
brucei brucei, because this protein kills the parasite by
generating ionic pores in the lysosomal membrane. Two T.
brucei subspecies (T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense)
can resist apoL1 and therefore, infect humans and cause
sleeping sickness. In T. b. rhodesiense, resistance to human
serum is linked to interaction of the Serum Resistance￾Associated (SRA) protein with the C-terminal region of
apoL1. We show that mutations targeted to this region
reduced its interaction with SRA while preserving the
activity of the ionic pore-forming domain. While some
mutants also lost their trypanolytic potential, C-terminal
mutants inspired by apoL1-like sequences of Papio anubis
conserved this activity, but also acquired the ability to
efficiently kill T. b. rhodesiense, both in vitro and in mice.
These findings demonstrate that interaction of SRA with
the C-terminus of apoL1 inactivate this protein and is
responsible for the resistance of T. b. rhodesiense to human
serum. Moreover, they suggest that apoL1-like proteins
could be responsible for the trypanolytic potential of Papio
species. Finally, Papio-like human apoL1 mutants could be
used to generate transgenic cattle that would resist both T.
b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense.

medium from these cells killed wild type E. coli when mixed with
these cells (data not shown). The toxicity exhibited by the apoL1
pore-forming domain was clearly dependent on acidic pH, since it
occurred when E. coli was grown in LB medium at pH 6, but not
at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1B).
In addition to its effect on E. coli, the pore-forming activity
of apoL1 is also responsible for the ability of this protein to kill
trypanosomes, although the trafficking and intracellular
targeting of the toxin are obviously very different between
the two systems [4]. Addition of recombinant apoL1 to T. b.
brucei resulted in efficient killing of the parasite, as measured
after overnight incubation (Fig. 1C). The trypanolytic activity
of apoL1 is known to be inhibited by the T. b. rhodesiense
protein SRA [1,5]. In order to analyze the mechanism by
which SRA neutralizes apoL1 pore-forming activity, we
constructed a bicistronic plasmid co-expressing the two
proteins in E. coli, under the dependence of two inducible T7
transcription promoters (pCDF-DUET; Fig. 2A). In this system
apoL1 was tagged at the C-terminus with V5 and 6-His
peptides, whereas SRA was provided with a C-term S tag.
Following induction of expression, apoL1 was purified by
binding to nickel beads, and after elution it was revealed using
anti-apoL1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, apoL1 was clearly
detected in the nickel-bound fraction. When co-expressed with
apoL1, SRA was also present in this fraction as revealed by
anti-S tag antibodies. However, in the absence of apoL1, SRA
was no longer found in the bound fraction (Fig. 2A). These
results indicated that in E. coli, co-expression of apoL1 and
SRA results in the formation of a complex associating these
two proteins. Consistent with the lysosomal localization of this
complex in T. brucei [1], the formation of the apoL1-SRA
complex appeared to be favoured at acidic pH as its amount
was strongly reduced upon E. coli lysis at different pH values
between pH 6 and pH 7 (Fig. 2A).
Significantly, the pore-forming activity of apoL1 was strongly
inhibited upon co-expression of SRA (Fig. 2B). Therefore, in the
E. coli expression system apoL1 appeared to be inactivated
following direct interaction with SRA.
The C-terminal domain of apoL1 is entirely responsible
for the interaction of this protein with SRA
We evaluated the level of interaction of SRA with different
mutants of apoL1 by measuring the relative amounts of either
protein bound to nickel beads. More precise measurement of this

values resulted from three independent experiments each performed in triplicate.

apoL1-SRA Interaction

interaction using plasmon resonance was impossible, due to the
propensity of both proteins to stick to various matrices (data not
shown). We generated apoL1 variants deleted of either one of the
three functional domains (del 1, del 2 and del 3 from N- to C-term,
see Fig. 1A). The presence in each case of an N-terminal bacterial
signal peptide (pelB) allowed the determination of the pore￾forming potential of the variants in E. coli irrespective of the
deletion of the membrane-addressing domain [4]. As expected [4],
only deletion of the N-terminal domain (del 1) resulted in the loss
of the pore-forming activity (Fig. 2B). Co-expression of SRA with
del 2 resulted in strong inhibition of the killing activity like it was
observed with wild-type apoL1, whereas SRA only mildly affected
the activity of del 3 (Fig. 2B). In accordance with these data, SRA
was found to bind to del 1 and del 2, but not to del 3 (Fig. 2C).
Altogether these data confirmed that SRA interacts with the
apoL1 C-terminal domain, and revealed that this interaction
inhibits apoL1 activity independently of the presence of the
membrane-addressing domain.
Deletion or mutations of the C-terminal domain do not
affect ionic pore-formation, but impede trypanolytic
activity
Recombinant forms of the three apoL1 variants del 1, del 2 and
del 3 were produced in E. coli and tested for their trypanolytic
potential. As expected, del 1 and del 2 were inactive (Fig. 1C).
Surprisingly, despite the full conservation of its intrinsic pore-forming
activity (Fig. 2B), del 3 was also inactive (Fig. 1C). These findings
confirmed a recent report [8], but contrasted with our previous work
where recombinant del 3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells
was found to kill NHS-sensitive trypanosomes [1].
The C-terminal domain of apoL1, as well as that of the other apoL
family members, is characterized by the presence of a leucine zipper
(Fig. 3A). Different mutants affecting this zipper were generated (Hel 1:
L378/382/385S; Hel 2: L378/382/385A; Hel 3: L378P). As shown in
Fig. 3A, in each case hydrophobic cluster analysis predicted a strong
reductionofhydrophobicinteractionpotential[9,10].Thiswasconfirmed
by the prediction of interaction energy using measurement of the mean
force potential according to the apoL1-SRA interaction model presented
in[1,11].Thisenergywasdecreasedinthemutantsequences(Table1).As
expected from this prediction, SRA interaction was reduced in the three
mutants (Fig. 3B,C). However, like in the case of the del 3 variant, these
mutants also largely lost their trypanolytic potential although they
conserved full pore-forming activity in E. coli (Fig. 3D,E). Therefore,
conservation of the C-terminal helix appeared to be necessary for the
trypanolytic activity of recombinant apoL1.
Identification of Papio apoL1-like proteins possibly
involved in trypanolytic activity
As shown in Fig. 4A, the serum of Papio cynocephalus was equally
able to lyze NHS-resistant and -sensitive T. b. rhodesiense clones,
although it did not affect T. b. gambiense (data not shown). As NHS
or recombinant apoL1 cannot lyze T. b. rhodesiense [1], the Papio
serum must contain a trypanolytic factor different from apoL1.
However, several observations suggest that this factor actually
resembles apoL1. First, like apoL1 the Papio trypanolytic factor is
bound to HDL particles, as Papio trypanolytic activity was present
in a serum fraction binding to anti-apoA1, the main constituent of
HDLs [7]. Second, like apoL1 [4], it was sensitive to inhibition by
the anionic channel inhibitor DIDS (Fig. 4A). Third, like apoL1 it
was inhibited by competition with an excess of haptoglobin,
suggesting its association with Hpr [7] (Fig. 4B). Fourth, the
cellular phenotype of trypanosome lysis by Papio serum, involving
considerable swelling of the lysosome, was indistinguishable from
that induced by NHS (Fig. 4C). Finally, proteins isolated from
Papio serum through binding to anti-apoA1 could be detected by
anti-apoL1 antibodies (Fig. 4D). However, as expected considering
the lack of resistance of T. b. rhodesiense to Papio serum, the apoL1-
like proteins of Papio were unable to bind to SRA (Fig. 4D). In
order to evaluate the possible presence of apoL1-like proteins in
Papio sp., we examined the currently available Papio anubis genomic
sequence information. As shown in Fig. 5, two apoL1-like
sequences were identified, one of which was shorter due to C￾terminal truncation. However, from the actual state of information
the two genes appeared to be interrupted by frameshift mutations,
and we confirmed this frameshift in reverse transcripts of these
genes from RNA of either blood cells of P. cynocephalus or
endometrium of P. anubis, using various combinations between 5
forward and 5 reverse primers from different regions (Fig. 5; data
not shown). So far we were unable to clone either gene with full
coding capacity.
C-terminal apoL1 mutants inspired by Papio sequences
kill both T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense
We hypothesized that converting the C-terminal sequence of
human apoL1 into those found in the two apoL1-like sequences of
Papio anubis could impede the interaction of this protein with SRA
and confer the capacity to kill T. b. rhodesiense. This involved the
replacement of the 386–389 sequence NNNY into TKIQ (TKIQ
mutant), as well as the same replacement together with the
removal of the 9 C-terminal amino acids (delTKIQ mutant)
(Fig. 6A). In addition to the latter mutant, we also generated
similar mutants where the four C-terminal amino acids of the
truncated version were intermediate between Papio and human
apoL1s (NKIQ, NNIQ, NNNQ, NNNY) (Fig. 6A). These changes
did not strongly affect the hydrophobic cluster pattern of the C￾terminal helix (Fig. 6A), but they significantly reduced the
predicted energy of interaction of apoL1 with SRA according to
the model presented in [1] (Table 1). Accordingly, these apoL1
variants lost their capacity to interact with SRA (Fig. 6B,C). All
mutants conserved their pore-forming activity in E. coli (Fig. 6D).
As shown in Fig. 6E, the different Papio-like apoL1 variants
efficiently killed both T. b. brucei and NHS-resistant clones of T. b.
rhodesiense. However, they were unable to kill T. b. gambiense.
We evaluated if the Papio-like apoL1 variants could exhibit
trypanolytic activity in mice as they did in vitro. As shown in
Fig. 7A, expression of apoL1 can optimally be detected in mice
one day after hydrodynamic injection of 10 mg of pCDNA3
plasmid encoding the protein. Similarly, apoL1 variants could be
detected one day post-injection of DNA, although the apoL1
mutants appeared to be less expressed than WT apoL1 (Fig. 7B).
Intraperitoneal inoculation of 106 trypanosomes from different T.
brucei subspecies was performed at that day post-DNA injection.
Infection by NHS-sensitive T. b. rhodesiense ETat 1.2S parasites was
inhibited following expression of either WT or delTKIQ apoL1, as
determined by the measurement of the parasite number at the
peak of parasitaemia (Fig. 7C). As expected, transgenic expression
of WT apoL1 did not confer protection against the NHS-resistant
T. b. rhodesiense clone ETat 1.2R (Fig. 7C). However, mice
expressing the delTKIQ apoL1 variant could resist both
trypanosome lines (Fig. 7C). Although both WT and delTKIQ
apoL1 almost completely erased the first peak of infection by ETat
1.2S parasites, infection reappeared afterwards and in both cases
all mice died between days 12 and 15 post-inoculation (data not
shown). This infection pattern was also observed for delTKIQ￾expressing mice infected with ETat 1.2R. These observations
contrast with the complete trypanolysis observed in vitro with
delTKIQ apoL1, and likely result from the rapid reduction of
apoL1-SRA Interaction

apoL1 concentration in the transgenic animals (Fig. 7A). The
delTKIQ-expressing mice were also able to kill T. congolense
(Fig. 7C). Therefore, it can be predicted that transgenic cattle
constitutively expressing this variant would resist infection by T. b.
brucei, T. b. rhodesiense and T. congolense. In contrast, neither WT nor
mutant apoL1 conferred protection against T. b. gambiense (Fig. 7C).
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that in E. coli, SRA inhibits the pore￾forming activity of apoL1 through direct interaction with the C￾terminal helix of this protein, and show that apoL1 variants unable
to bind SRA through deletion or mutations of this helix could
overcome this inhibition. It is particularly interesting to note that
the apoL1 variant lacking the original membrane-addressing
domain (but containing a bacterial signal peptide to compensate
this activity) was still fully inhibited following co-expression of SRA
in E. coli. This result indicates that the membrane-addressing
domain is dispensable for the control of the pore-forming domain
by SRA, suggesting that this control does not operate through
refolding of the protein. A possible explanation would be that
interaction with SRA prevents membrane targeting of apoL1.

Similarly to the situation in E. coli, apoL1 variants unable to
bind SRA were found to kill NHS-resistant trypanosomes,
confirming that the conclusions drawn in E. coli regarding the
neutralization of the protein by SRA were also valid for
trypanosomes. In particular, the fact that in E. coli SRA can
directly inhibit the activity of apoL1 suggests that in
trypanosomes, its effect on apoL1 would not necessarily operate
through reorientation of apoL1 trafficking in the cell. However,
a clear difference was observed between E. coli and trypano￾somes. In the latter case, conservation of most of the C-terminal
helix was required to keep the lytic potential intact, even for
trypanosomes devoid of SRA. Altogether these conclusions
essentially confirmed our earlier proposal [1], although our
message concerning the truncated apoL1 variant ending at
S342 had to be corrected. In [1], we showed data suggesting
that this variant, equivalent to the del 3 apoL1 version studied
in this work, was able to kill both T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense.
In contrast, in a recent report analyzing the trypanolytic
potential of apoL1 expressed transiently in mice following
hydrodynamic plasmid transfection, the del 3 variant was found
to be no longer trypanolytic [8]. This controversy could be
resolved in this study, where we confirmed the last observation.
Thus, it would appear that in contrast to what occurs in E. coli,
in trypanosomes the C-terminal domain of apoL1 is not
completely dispensable for the killing activity of the protein.
Given the obvious differences between the two biological
systems this observation could be explained in many ways. In
the E. coli system the membrane targeting is direct and entirely
intracellular, and like experimentally observed with bacterial
colicins the isolated pore-forming domain of apoL1 can exhibit
full toxic activity provided a membrane-addressing peptide is
present [4]. In trypanosomes the toxin must be taken up
through endocytosis, which requires a more complex trafficking
pathway, and the target is the lysosomal membrane instead of
the plasma membrane. Among other possibilities the C￾terminal helix could be required for proper trafficking and/or
targeting to the lysosomal membrane, or its absence could
result in improper folding of the protein. Regarding the
possible influence of the purification procedure on the protein
conformation, it should be noted that after reconstitution with
lipid particles, recombinant apoL1 was found to kill trypano￾somes with efficiency close to that of native apoL1 in normal
human serum, suggesting that the full-size recombinant protein
is not significantly denatured during purification [4].
Interestingly, it was through inspiration driven by sequence
analysis of Papio apoL1-like genes that we were able to generate
apoL1 variants unable to bind SRA but still able to efficiently
kill trypanosomes. As expected, these variants killed NHS￾resistant T. b. rhodesiense clones as well as NHS-sensitive T. b.
rhodesiense clones or T. b. brucei, like occurs with Papio serum.
This finding strongly suggests that in Papio serum similar apoL1
variants are responsible for the trypanolytic activity. However,
we were unable to identify such proteins, as frameshift
mutations apparently prevented the possible candidates to be

functional. This result was repeatedly observed following RT￾PCR amplification of transcripts from either blood cells or
endometrium tissue, using various combinations of 5 forward
and 5 reverse primers specific to the apoL1-like genes from the
Papio anubis sequence database. Given our failure to detect any
functional Papio apoL1-like sequence, we can only speculate
about the nature of the trypanolytic factor in these organisms.
Among other possibilities, apoL4 could replace apoL1 given the
presence of a sequence encoding a putative signal peptide in
this gene, as also occurs in humans [12]. However, it should be
noted that this apoL4 variant was never detected in human
serum so far. Thus, despite the identity between the
trypanolytic phenotypes exhibited between Papio serum and
the apoL1 mutant generated in this work, we cannot exclude
that this mutant is without relevance concerning the genuine
trypanolytic activity of Papio sp. The existence of baboon apoL1
variants able to resist SRA would be consistent with the recent
proposal that variations of apoL sequences are frequent at sites
of interaction with pathogen proteins [13], although the apoL1
mutations/deletion described here were not described in this
report.
As is the case with Papio serum [14], the Papio-like human apoL1
was unable to kill T. b. gambiense. This observation is in keeping
with the fact that in this subspecies the mechanism of resistance to
apoL1 must be different from that of T. b. rhodesiense, as SRA is
absent from T. b. gambiense [15]. Therefore, it appears that
resistance to NHS in T. b. gambiense is independent from the C￾terminal domain of apoL1.
The results presented in this work are promising in terms of
generating transgenic cattle able to resist infection by African
trypanosomes in Eastern Africa. Indeed, we show that mice
transiently expressing Papio-like human apoL1 variants resist not
only T. b. brucei, but also NHS-resistant clones of T. b. rhodesiense
and the cattle pathogen T. congolense. Moreover, given the
sensitivity of T. evansi to apoL1 [16] this transgenic cattle should
resist T. evansi as well, and similar prediction could be proposed for
T. vivax.
Finally, in view of these results it can be envisaged that
understanding the mechanism of resistance of T. b. gambiense to
NHS would allow us to generate mutant versions of apoL1 also
able to kill this parasite.

39 NotI site downstream from the His6 tag coding sequence. The
PCR fragment was cloned in NcoI and NotI sites of the first
polylinker of pCDF-Duet1 expression vector (Novagen). Mutant
versions of apoL1 were created by site-directed mutagenesis with
Accuprime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and verified by
sequencing. The complete SRA coding sequence was obtained by
PCR from pTSA-Rib-SRA [5] with primers creating a 59 Ecl136II
and 39 SalI sites. The DNA fragment was cloned in frame with the
S-tag coding sequence in EcoRV and XhoI sites of the second
polylinker of pCDF-Duet1 vector and pCDF-Duet apoL1-V5-His6
construct.
The plasmid constructs were transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3)
and expression of recombinant proteins was induced from an
exponentially growing culture by 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thioga￾lactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 37uC. Bacteria were
resuspended in 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.2) and lysed by two
passages in French Press. Cell debris were removed by
centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min, and inclusion bodies were
recovered from supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000g for
15 min. Purification was performed from inclusion bodies
dissolved in 6 M guanidium chloride, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Solubilized proteins were incubated for 1 h
with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen), and the bound proteins were
extensively washed with 4 M guanidium chloride, 50 mM Tris￾HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, before elution
with 4 M guanidium chloride in 0.2 M acetic acid. After dialysis

against 20 mM acetic acid, the proteins were concentrated
(Vivaspin, Sartorius). Purity and concentration were estimated
by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.
Pore-forming activity in bacteria
Cultures of BL21(DE3) strains transfected with pCDF-Duet1
constructs were grown at 37uC in LB containing 1% glucose and
50 mg/ml streptomycin from freshly plated colonies until optical
density at 600nm (OD600) reached 0.7 to 0.8. Serial dilutions
were plated onto LB containing 50 mg/ml streptomycin and either
1% glucose (non-induced control) or 50 to 75 mM IPTG
(induction of recombinant proteins). Usually the pH of LB was
6.0, but the effect of raising the pH to 7.5 was evaluated. Colonies
were counted after overnight incubation at 37uC and results were

expressed as the ratio of colonies with and without IPTG induction.
These results reflect the pore-forming activity of apoL1 [4].
Copurification of apoL1 and SRA from bacteria
Cultures of BL21(DE3) strains transfected with pCDF-Duet1
constructs were grown at 37uC in LB containing 50 mg/ml
streptomycin and 1% glucose from freshly plated colonies untill
OD600 reached 0.7 to 0.8. Cultures were centrifuged and
bacteria pellet was resuspended in fresh medium without
glucose and distributed in 3 flasks to perform induction and
copurification in triplicate. Expression of recombinant proteins
was induced by addition of 1mM IPTG overnight at 20uC and
80 rpm. Cell density was measured by OD600 and bacteria
were centrifuged and resuspended in (10% of culture volu￾me6OD600) in cold hypotonic buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.0 or
pH 7.0) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche).
Bacteria were lysed by Fast Prep 24 (MP Biomedicals) with 1/10
volume of glass beads (Lysing Matrix B, MP Biomedicals), for
3630 s at 6 m.s21
. Cell lysate was complemented by 0.6M
NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 20 mM imidazole, and vortexed
vigorously. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation for
15 min at 16,000 g, and the supernatant was applied onto Ni￾NTA beads (Qiagen) equilibrated in the same buffer, for 2 h at
4uC. Fig. S1 shows a comparative evaluation of the yield of the
different apoL1 variants and SRA in the supernatants. After
binding the beads were washed with 20 volumes of beads with
cold binding buffer and the bound proteins were eluted with 2
volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatant and bound
fractions were analyzed by western blotting. ApoL1 was
revealed with anti-recombinant apoL1 rat serum and perox￾ydase conjugated anti-rat antibody. SRA-Stag was detected by
anti-Stag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and peroxydase
conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Peroxydase activity was
revealed by ECL (Western Lighting Chemiluminescence
Reagent PLUS, Perkin Elmer). Signals were quantified in
supernatant and bound fractions using ImageQuant TL
Software (GE Healthcare). Since only a fraction of each
supernatant and elution was loaded onto the gel, the values
obtained were reported to the total volume of lysis or elution
(‘‘supernatant’’ and ‘‘bound’’ lanes respectively). ApoL1 and
SRA binding values to nickel were calculated separately and the
binding of SRA to apoL1 was expressed as ‘‘SRA binding versus
apoL1 binding’’ ratio. The ratio obtained for SRA binding to
WT apoL1 was considered as 100%.
Parasites
Trypanosoma brucei brucei 328-114 [17] were grown in HMI9
supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 10% Serum Plus [18]
at 37uC in 5% CO2. T. b. rhodesiense ETat 1.2 NHS-resistant (R) and
NHS-sensitive (S) clones and T. b. gambiense LiTat 1.2 were grown in
IMDM medium supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum [19].
In vitro trypanolysis assays
The parasites were diluted at a final concentration of 5.105
cells/ml, and recombinant WT or mutant apoL1, in 20 mM acetic
acid, was added to reach 10 to 30 mg/ml. Dilution of the parasite
culture medium never exceeded 15%, and in control samples
without apoL1 the medium was similarly diluted with 20 mM
acetic acid. As no attempt was made to reconstitute these proteins
into HDL particles, the formation of aggregates is likely. Living
parasites were counted in duplicate under the microscope. When
lysis was not complete after 8 h, parasites were counted in
duplicate after 24 h incubation and cell survival was expressed as
% of control. Lysis experiments with human and Papio serum, as
well as imaging of living immobilised trypanosomes, were
performed as described in [20].
Sequence analysis
Alignments were performed by CLUSTALW software and
edited with GeneDoc (http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc).
Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) was used to compare the
proteins at 2D level [9,10] (http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.
fr/cgi-bin/portal.py?form = HCA).
Energy calculation based on mean force potential
To calculate the energy of interaction, we used an approach
based on a non-local energy between peptides [21]. The mean
force potentials used here are based on 500 proteins, using 7
different atomic types, which are polar and nonpolar hydrogens
(H), Csp2 and Csp3, O, S and N. Different functions have been
evaluated for all the possible atomic pairs. These energy functions
have been estimated for distances going from 0.0 to 10.0 A˚ with a
0.1 A˚ precision.
Transient expression in mice
The hydrodynamic transfection of mice was performed
according to the method described in [22]. Briefly, 2 ml of saline
solution containing 10 mg of pcDNA3-1 or pcDNA3-1 WT apoLI￾V5His/del3-V5His/delTKIQ-V5His were injected in less than
8 seconds in the vein of the tail of 8 weeks-old BALB/c female
mice. At day 1, an aliquot of blood was analyzed by Western blot
for expression of apoL1 and mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 106 trypanosomes.

Western blots of serial dilutions of E. coli soluble extracts were
incubated with rat anti-apoL1 or rabbit anti-S tag antibodies. As
shown on the right, the relative efficiency of apoL1-SRA binding is
unrelated to either protein yield.
