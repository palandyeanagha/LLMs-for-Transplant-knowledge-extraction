ABSTRACT
Purpose Local ablative therapies have become an established
treatment option in interventional oncology. Radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are a standard
of care in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Currently, there is an increasing interest in cryotherapy, one
of the oldest ablation techniques. It has some unique charac￾teristics with regard to technology and mechanism of action.
Materials and Methods A systematic literature search using
the terms cryotherapy, cryosurgery and cryoablation was per￾formed. Selected studies are presented dealing with the
mechanism of action, cryobiology and clinical use of percuta￾neous, image-guided cryoablation. Recent developments and
perspectives are presented.
Results Cryotherapy is increasingly used and has been inclu￾ded in guidelines for selected tumor entities such as renal cell
carcinoma. Cryo-immunotherapy and combination treat￾ments are future areas of interest.
Conclusion Cryoabalation may be used in many indications.
Its major advantages are its unique visualization and the anes￾thesiologic effects of cold. While there are only a few prospec￾tively randomized trials, the existing data on the use of cryo￾ablation is promising. Its use appears to be justified in selected
tumors, oligometastatic patients and for palliative indications.
Key Points
▪ Interventionalists need to know about the unique charac￾teristics and advantages of cryoablation.
▪ Proper patient selection and optimal image guidance are
essential for successful cryotherapy.
▪ Cryoablation offers unique advantages such as anesthe￾siologic effects and characteristic imaging features.
▪ The lack of prospective randomized trials is a key disad￾vantage of cryoablation.

Introduction
The application of extreme cold is a well-established method for
destroying tissue [1]. Cryotherapy is currently used in numerous
organ regions from the head to the foot. Although the brain, eye,
heart, esophagus, and respiratory tract are also target structures
for cryotherapy, primarily malignancies of the liver, kidney, lung,
prostate, and breast are treated with cryotherapy in interventional
radiology. As a result of increasingly early detection of tumors,
expertise regarding the use of image-guided puncture tech￾niques, and broad availability of such techniques, local ablation
of tumors has become a mainstay of tumor therapy. Cryoablation
is only one of many techniques for tissue destruction but has very
specific characteristics that are particularly interesting for tumor
treatment. The following provides an overview of the use and cur￾rent status of percutaneous cryotherapy.
History of cryotherapy
The clinical application of cryotherapy dates back to the 19th cen￾tury. Already prior to 1850, saline solutions were cooled to tem￾peratures between -18 and -24 °C and used to treat superficial
tumors, e. g. in the region of the breast and cervix [2]. At the start
of the 20th century, a significantly more effective cryogen with a
temperature of -78.5 °C became available in the form of dry ice
(solid CO2), resulting in a significant expansion of the application
of cryotherapy, primarily in dermatology [3]. Commercial avail￾ability of liquid nitrogen marked the beginning of modern cryo￾therapy. This highly effective cryogen made it possible to reach a
temperature of -196 °C, and the development of various applica￾tors made it possible to treat deeper locations.
The introduction of a vacuum-assisted applicator for neurosur￾gery in 1961 marked a decisive milestone for cryotherapy [4].
What was originally a dermatological method developed into an
entire group of primarily intraoperative applications. Thus, the
term cryosurgery became established. Despite many develop￾ments, e. g. the development of gas-based cryotherapy devices
[5], routine use remained limited to a few indications. Cryother￾apy again achieved clinical significance in the 1990 s with modern
imaging and the miniaturization of applicators. The image-guided
cryotherapy systems used today in interventional radiology utilize
the Joule-Thomson effect which describes the isenthalpic throt￾tling effect of gases, i. e., the ability of a gas to extract thermal
energy from the surrounding area during fast expansion. This
form of image-guided therapy resulted in the term cryoablation
so that today the terms cryotherapy, cryosurgery, and cryoabla￾tion are often used synonymously.
Mechanism of action and cryobiology
The type and extent of tissue reaction depend on the severity of
the cold damage. This is largely controlled by the use of freezing
and thawing processes and the temperatures that are achieved.
The total cold damage is a mixture of direct and indirect effects.
The application of cold initially results in the formation
of extracellular ice crystals. As a result of a shift of the osmotic
balance, water moves from the intracellular space into the inter￾stitium, resulting in dehydration and initial cell damage. This pro￾cess is at least partially reversible. However, if freezing occurs very
quickly, a majority of the fluid remains intracellular since there is
insufficient time for osmotic processes, resulting in the formation
of intracellular ice crystals. These have a destructive effect on the
cell membrane and cell organelles. During thawing, water flows
from the hypotonic interstitium into the cells thus resulting in fur￾ther cell damage or even bursting of the cells. Consequently,
more intracellular water is available in a second freezing process
for the formation of particularly lethal intracellular ice crystals [6].
A further relevant factor is the collapse of the blood supply on
the microvascular level due to damage to the vessel wall as a result
of ice formation in the endothelium. After thawing, the damaged
endothelium comes in contact with the thrombocytes, resulting
in the formation of a thrombosis and thus local ischemia. More￾over, the increased capillary permeability resulting from the vas￾cular damage and the local formation of edema with consecutive
swelling of the tissue contribute to the ischemia [7].
In recent years apoptosis has also been recognized as an im￾portant mechanism for local tumor therapy particularly in the
periphery of the ablation zone. Mitochondrial damage due to acti￾vation of caspase 3 and the bax protein has been identified [8].
The sensitivity of different tissues to cold differs greatly. While
it can be assumed that one-time application of a temperature of
-40 °C to -60 °C is sufficient to completely destroy tissue, this is
not the case at a temperature of -20 °C. Tissue differences have a
greater impact at this temperature. For example, while osteocytes
will definitely die in this temperature range, tissue from a healthy
liver, kidney or prostate can survive one-time application of such a
temperature. Compared to healthy cells, tumor cells have greater
and variable resistance to cold [9]. Moreover, fibroblasts and col￾lagen fibers usually survive a freezing process [10].
The extent of the aforementioned effects and thus the effective￾ness of cryoablation can be influenced by the speed, duration, and
number of freeze and thaw processes. According to current knowl￾edge, the use of at least two freeze-thaw cycles with fast freezing
and slow thawing is particularly effective [11]. The freezing process
should last at least 10 minutes since equilibrium between cold gen￾eration and the dissipation of cold at the periphery of the ablation
zone is achieved and the ice ball reaches its maximum size only after
10 – 15 minutes. Furthermore, the speed of the freezing process de￾creases from the center to the periphery so that the freezing process
does not last long enough in the peripheral tissue to achieve lethal
damage. It must be taken into consideration that prolonged freez￾ing is necessary primarily at higher temperatures to achieve a pro￾nounced destructive effect. The second freeze-thaw cycle helps
to bring the lethal effects to the periphery of the ice ball. Moreover,
it is essential that the ice ball extend beyond the borders of the tar￾geted treatment area since the 0 °C isotherm as the border of the
visible ice ball does not correspond to the border of the effective
ablation area. It must exceed the lesion to be treated by at least
5 – 8 mm so that the -20 °C zone reaches the entire lesion.

Application
Significant and very fast cooling is induced around an applicator
inserted into the tissue. The Joule Thomson effect is utilized by
the currently available percutaneous systems. This effect describes
how real gases experience a change in temperature after fast ex￾pansion. Gases with a high inversion temperature, such as argon,
experience cooling under expansion (argon up to -185 °C). Gases
with a low inversion temperature, e. g. helium, undergo warming.
Currently used cryoablation systems are closed systems in
which gas is conducted under high pressure into a thin applicator.
An expansion chamber in which the gas can expand very quickly
so that the Joule Thomson effect is utilized is located in the tip of
the applicator. An insulator which prevents the cold from traveling
along the shaft is applied to the shaft of the cryo-applicator prox￾imal to the expansion chamber to limit the cold effect on tissue
outside the target area.
Two systems for percutaneous cryoablation are currently in
common use: Visual Ice (Galil – BTG, Farnham, UK) and Endocare
Cryocare (Health Tronics, Austin, TX, USA). Both systems use ar￾gon for freezing and helium for thawing. Some newer probes for
the Visual Ice system can also be electrically heated. This allows
ablation of the puncture tract and does not require expensive he￾lium.
The broad availability of image guidance techniques contribut￾ed to the renaissance of cryoablation in the late 1990 s. The ice
ball can be effectively visualized and monitored with ultrasound,
computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging
(▶ Fig. 1). The ice ball can also be visualized three-dimensionally
on CT and MRI. Even thermometry within the ice is possible with
MRI [12]. In contrast, ultrasound shows only the surface of the ice
with subsequent total echo cancellation. This limits the use of
ultrasound-guided cryoablation.
Application-relevant advantages of cryotherapy compared to
other techniques are the anesthetic effect of cold which simplifies
use in local anesthesia. Application does not require any electrical
currents so that cryoablation does not interact with imaging.
Therefore, continuous monitoring of the size of the ice is possible
even with MR guidance. Since every probe is independent, multi￾ple probes can be used in combination with greater flexibility than
in radiofrequency ablation (RFA), for example. Additional theore￾tical advantages are the preservation of fibroblasts which often
maintains the primary tissue structure resulting in a matrix for
healing. Therefore, for example, ablation in the direct vicinity of
the renal pelvis without destruction of the renal pelvis is possible
[13]. Healing, albeit often prolonged healing, is possible even in
the ablation of nerves if the nerve sheath is preserved (▶ Fig. 2)
[14, 15] The pronounced immune-stimulating effects of cryoabla￾tion compared to other ablation techniques can also be seen as an
advantage.
A clear disadvantage of cryoablation is the relatively high cost
not only for probes but also for helium and argon. Each cryother￾apy probe has only a limited range in tissue so that multiple
probes are usually needed. This provides medically desirable flex￾ibility regarding the size and shape of the ablation area but is not
covered by the current DRG-based billing system in Germany.
Moreover, cryoablation results in an inflammatory response that
can result in individual cases – primarily in the ablation of large
liver tumors – in systemic cytokine-mediated cryoshock syn￾drome with hypotension, dyspnea, and disseminated intravasal
coagulation. Moreover, aggressive manipulation of probes in fro￾zen tissue can result in parenchyma tears and subsequent bleed￾ing [16].
Results
There are numerous reports regarding the application of cryo￾ablation for almost all organ and body regions. Most of these are
retrospective cohort studies with high variability regarding
patient selection, procedure, and aftercare so that there is only
limited comparability of data. Only a few high-quality compa￾rative studies and randomized controlled trials are available.
Selected study data are presented in the following for the most
commonly treated organ regions to provide an overview of the
current status of the use of percutaneous cryotherapy.
Kidney
Next to the treatment of prostate cancer, the treatment of kidney
tumors is probably the most common application area of cryoa￾blation. Cryotherapy is usually performed both percutaneously
and laparoscopically. Percutaneous cryoablation is indicated in
small tumors (T1a). However, T1b tumors are also included in
numerous studies. Given the rarity of lymph node metastases in
these organ-limited lesions, therapy is performed with a curative
intent.
The oncological effectiveness of percutaneous cryoablation for
the treatment of T1 renal cell carcinomas has been repeatedly
shown. For example, Breen et al. were able to show in 171 T1a/b
tumors with an average follow-up period of 20.1 months that
treatment is also safe in patients with relevant comorbidities
(Charlson Index Score = 7.15) with 4.6 % Clavien–Dindo grade
2 complications. Only one case of local tumor relapse occurred
during follow-up and was accessible for another cryotherapy pro￾cedure [17]. Georgiades found a 5-year overall survival rate of
97 % with a tumor-specific overall survival rate of 100 % in 134 his￾tologically verified T1a/b renal cell carcinomas. Grade 3 or 4 com￾plications according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Ad￾verse Events (CTCAE – Version 4.0) occurred in 6 % of patients
[18]. Both series did not show a significantly worse result for the
treatment of T1b tumors but the number of patients with tumors
> 4 cm was limited in both series. A metaanalysis found no differ￾ences between percutaneous and laparoscopic cryoablation re￾garding oncological results. No difference could be shown with re￾spect to survival, but the length of hospitalization was shorter for
percutaneous cryotherapy [19]. The data compared to percuta￾neous cryotherapy with partial nephrectomy are more difficult to
interpret. Some examinations do not show a difference regarding
the oncological result [20, 21] while other data have an advantage
for partial nephrectomy – however with a significant bias in pa￾tient selection in favor of partial nephrectomy [22]. Interestingly,
the relevant oncological results were not worse even in the treat￾ment of T1b tumors in the aforementioned series. However, the

complication rates increase to 15 – 17 % when treating large tu￾mors [23, 24] so that cryotherapy should be limited to patients
with T1a tumors particularly in high-risk patients.
Liver
Cryoablation of the liver was considered problematic for a long
time following reports about fatal outcomes due to so-called
cryoshock after ablation of large liver lesions [25]. More recent
▶ Fig. 2 A 68-year-old patient presented with a biochemical recurrence 10 years after radical prostectomy. PSMA (prostate-specific membrane
antigen)-PET/CT revealed a histologically proven lilac lymph node metastasis a. The patient underwent CT-guided cryoablation of the lymph node
metastasis, which was located in close proximity to the sciatic nerve (arrow, b). On post-interventional MRI c, there is no contrast enhancement of
the lymph node, indicating successful treatment. The sciatic nerve is swollen. Impaired sensation of the skin and foot recovered spontaneously
several weeks after treatment. Nine months after the procedure, the patient is free of tumor according to imaging and biochemical markers.

lesion on the left apex of the prostate gland. Diffusion-weighted (arrows, a) and T2-weighted images (arrows, b) prior to treatment depict the
carcinoma as a hypointense lesion. The patient underwent MR-guided cryoablation. Real-time MRI shows an elliptical signal void (asterisk), cor￾responding to the ice. Follow-up MRI one year after the procedure shows no signs of residual or recurrent tumor. The signal intensity of the tumor
bearing part of the prostate is inconspicuous (arrows, d & e). According to biochemical markers, the patient was free of tumor.

studies no longer report this problem and high-quality data
regarding the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now
available [16]. However, the significance of cryoablation of liver tu￾mors compared to RFA or microwave ablation (MWA) is negligible.
The most important study on cryoablation of HCC to date is a
randomized, controlled multicenter study published by Wang et
al. in 2015 in which 180 patients with 1 – 2 HCCs < 4 cm and
Child-Pugh stage A or B were treated either via cryoablation or
RFA. A significantly lower local progression rate after cryoablation
(7.7 %) compared to RFA (18.2 %; p = 0.041) was able to be shown
for tumors > 3 cm in particular. However, no difference in survival
rate was able to be shown. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival
rates were almost identical at 97 %, 67 %, and 40 %, respectively,
for cryoablation compared to 97 %, 66 %, and 38 %, respectively,
after RFA (p = 0.747). As an important finding, the safety of hepa￾tic cryoablation with a complication rate similar to RFA of 3.9 %
versus 3.3 % could be shown (p = 0.776) [25].
Other case series have been able to confirm better local control
of early HCCs after cryoablation compared to RFA [26]. However, a
current metaanalysis shows a more inhomogeneous picture with
a higher complication rate after cryoablation [27]. The use of
cryoablation in intermediate and advanced HCCs and in unresect￾able and recurrent tumors has also been reported. Of course, such
cases are associated with worse results than in earlier stages and
in smaller tumors [28, 29].
The use of percutaneous cryotherapy in liver metastases is more
problematic than in HCCs. Although current series mainly including
liver metastases of colorectal tumors are available, there are no pro￾spective randomized studies. Two current series including 742 liver
tumors yielded acceptable results regarding safety in tumors < 4 cm
with grade ≥ 3 complications in 5.8 – 8.7 % of interventions but a
significant increase in the complication rate in larger lesions [30,
31]. There are significant differences with respect to results, i. e.,
Littrup et al. showed a local progression rate similar to that of other
methods of 11.1 % after 1.8 years in metastases of colorectal tu￾mors [30] while the progression rate reported by Glazer et al. after
2.5 years was 25.4 % [31]. In a separate study including 59 patients
with 151 liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas, Littrup's group
reports an average survival rate of 23.6 months after cryotherapy
[32]. As a result of the use of different report standards and adju￾vant therapies, it is difficult to compare data. However, smaller tu￾mors showed significantly better local control also in this case.
Promising results are also available for liver metastases in
breast cancer [33], ovarian cancer [34], and neuroendocrine
tumors [35]. Numerous series provide initial information regard￾ing the local effectiveness of this therapy also in liver metastases
of other tumor entities [30, 31]. Recommendations regarding
cryoablation of liver metastases have not yet been able to be
derived from the limited data.
Lung
In the treatment of primary lung tumors, there is currently mini￾mal but positive data regarding non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). In 64 high-risk patients with NSCLC in stage I who were
not suitable for lobectomy, Zemlyak et al. were not able to show a
difference regarding survival between cryoablation, radiofre￾quency ablation, and sublobar resection with a 3-year overall sur￾vival rate of 77 %, 87.5 %, and 87.1 %, respectively (p > 0.05). The
tumor-specific 3-year overall survival rate (90.2 %, 90.6 % and
87.5 %) showed even smaller differences [36]. Only recently were
Moore et al. able to confirm these results with a 3-year and 5-year
overall survival rate of 78.1 % and 67.8 %, respectively. The tumor￾specific 5-year survival rate was even 87.9 % here [37].
Cryotherapy has also been used for the treatment of advanced
NSCLC. However, given the usually palliative treatment intention
and the use of multiple treatment options, these cases are diffi￾cult to interpret. Niu et al. were able to show in a retrospective
analysis in 54 patients (31 with cryoablation, 23 without cryoabla￾tion) that a survival advantage can be achieved even for patients
in stage IV. In a follow-up period of 6.5 years, the survival of pa￾tients receiving additional intra- and/or extrathoracic cryoablation
was significantly better than in patients who did not undergo ad￾ditional ablative therapy. The average overall survival rate of both
groups was 14 vs. 7 months (p < 0.01) [38].
The current data for the treatment of lung metastases is signif￾icantly more problematic. The only prospective study available to
date on this topic has only one treatment arm including a total of
60 lesions of different entities, primarily lung metastases of colo￾rectal tumors (40 %). After a year at a tumor-specific survival rate
of 100 %, new metastases were detected in 40 % of the patients.
Although local control could not be achieved in only 5.8 % of
patients, the systemic problem of the underlying disease is still
present [39]. Numerous retrospective studies confirm this data
with there being significant variability regarding local control and
survival [40 – 42].
The complications of pulmonary ablation are similar to those
of other needle-based ablation techniques. Therefore, pneumo￾thorax and pleural effusion as well as hemoptysis are common
and are reported in up to 60 % of procedures. However, they
usually do not require treatment. Only the need for a thoracic
drain was reported in up to 25 % of cases of pneumothorax. Tumor
size and the use of multiple ablation electrodes were independent
risk factors for the development of a complication [43].
Breast
Cryotherapy of the breast was initially primarily successfully used
to treat symptomatic fibroadenomas [44]. Treatment results in a
significant volume reduction and more than 80 % of fibroadeno￾mas are no longer palpable a year after treatment [45].
The use of cryotherapy in breast cancer has also become estab￾lished. However, some special features must be taken into consid￾eration. There is initially a significantly elevated risk of locally
incomplete ablation in tumors > 2 cm so that the size is a decisive
prognostic factor [46, 47]. Moreover, most ablations were per￾formed with ultrasound guidance. Since ultrasound shows only
the surface of the ice ball without the three-dimensional context,
it must be viewed as suboptimal technology given existing tech￾niques. In a current metaanalysis, it was able to be shown that
the technical success rate of cryoablation was 93 % (95 % CI 81 –
98 %). At the same time, with a rate of major complications of
only 2 % (95 %CI 1 – 7 %), cryoablation had the most favorable risk
profile of all ablation techniques [48].

86 patients with 87 breast carcinomas < 2 cm were included in a
current prospective study with subsequent resection of the lesions
and were treated via cryotherapy with an ablation system based on
liquid nitrogen. This requires ultrasound-guided positioning of
only one needle. Under these problematic conditions, local tumor
control could be achieved in 92 % of cases with the result being sig￾nificantly better in small tumors up to 1 cm than in larger tumors
[49]. Another study showed local control of 76.9 % of breast carci￾nomas up to 3 cm after 12 months. The need to use multiple nee￾dles particularly in large lesions > 1.5 cm is referenced here [50].
The advantages of cryoablation are the low complication rate and
the good cosmetic results. A clear disadvantage is the inability to
perform axillary lymph node dissection so that there is total
dependence on imaging. High variability in the relevant number
of local and locoregional relapses in 1.7 % to 20 % of cases was
described even after skin-sparing, breast-conserving resection
[51]. In light of current data, local cryotherapy of breast cancer in
high-risk patients with small tumors seems worth considering.
Musculoskeletal system
Cryoablation is established for controlling symptomatic muscu￾loskeletal lesions primarily in palliative cases. It could be shown
for a broad range of skeletal regions including the spinal column
that both improvement of the pain score and a reduction in pain
medication can be achieved in only one week [52, 53]. Callstrom
et al. reported a reduction of the pain score on a visual analog
scale from 7.1/10 prior to treatment to 4/10 after 4 weeks [53].
However, the long-term effects are variable. Some studies report
an improvement over 6 months and longer [53] while other au￾thors describe a recurrence of pain already after 3 months in indi￾vidual patients [54]. Adjunctive measures, such as selective nerve
blocks, can support the effect of cryotherapy in a palliative indica￾tion [52]. The combination of cryoablation in this indication with
bisphosphonate therapy is advantageous since the effects are
synergistic [55]. Complications are rare with temporary neuro￾pathy being described most frequently in up to 6 % of cases
depending on the position of the lesion [52].
The use of cryoablation in primary bone tumors has been
described in various constellations. It can be effective in benign
lesions such as aneurysmatic bone cysts [56, 57]. Cryotherapy
has also been successfully evaluated for benign, locally invasive
desmoid tumors with good response rates and tumor progression
between 0 % and 4 % over 2 years after ablation [58, 59]. Only
anecdotal reports regarding malignant primary tumors of the
musculoskeletal system are available [60] so that cryoablation is
not indicated as a primary therapy outside of studies. However,
cryotherapy can be successful for the management of sympto￾matic retroperitoneal sarcoma relapse, for example. Therefore,
Fan et al. were able to report a significant pain reduction from
7.49/10 to 5.44/10 (p = 0.01) on a visual analog scale after cryo￾therapy of cases of retroperitoneal sarcoma relapse [61].
The treatment of bone and soft-tissue metastases in oligometa￾static patients with up to 4 musculoskeletal metastases to be treat￾ed has also been evaluated in large retrospective series with vari￾able local tumor control: 67 % in bone lesions and 97 % in soft￾tissue lesions after 21 months [62]. Another series describes a
local relapse rate of 10 % after 11 months with there being differen￾ces depending on the tumor location [63]. Treatment of a limited
number of bone metastases seems promising. Deschamps et al. re￾port local tumor-free survival in 67 % of patients after one year in a
collective of 89 oligometastatic patients with 122 bone metastases
of various primary tumors after radiofrequency ablation or cryoa￾blation. Lesions smaller than 2 cm without cortical erosion had a
particularly favorable prognosis. Local tumor-free survival after
one year was achieved in 85 % of cases [64]. Supplementary meas￾ures such as osteoplasty can be necessary regardless of ablative
therapy. This form of treatment does not rule out subsequent
radiotherapy. The complication rates are very low with only individ￾ual grade 3 complications in the above-mentioned series.
Prostate
Focal treatment of prostate cancer is a commonly performed but
also controversial treatment option [65, 66]. Cryotherapy is one of
multiple focal treatment options. Both treatment of the entire
prostate and focal treatment of tumor areas verified on imaging
and by biopsy are possible. However, in the latter approach it
must be taken into consideration that prostate cancer is often
multifocal. However, not every verified carcinoma is biologically
relevant. Cryotherapy of the prostate also plays a role as a salvage
option after radiation therapy. In this situation, the operation
is particularly complex and is associated with a significantly
increased rate of complications, such as damage to the rectum
(~2 %) and incontinence (~23 %) [67].
The COLD register can be referenced as the largest individual
study regarding cryoablation of the prostate. The results of focal
cryotherapy in 1160 patients and ablation of the entire prostate in
4099 patients are documented here. The biochemical recurrence￾free survival rate after 3 years was 75.7 % after focal ablation and
75.1 % after ablation of the entire prostate. The complication
rates after focal ablation are lower than after cryoablation of the
entire prostate. However, on the whole, the complication rates
are lower than after surgical therapy [68]. A current systematic
review regarding focal therapy of prostate cancer identified 11
analyzable publications regarding focal cryotherapy. Prospective
randomized studies are lacking. Ablation was performed under
transrectal ultrasound guidance. In a median follow-up interval
of 26 months, tumor-specific survival and overall survival were
both 100 %. A second focal treatment was necessary in 7.6 % of
patients. The rate of severe complications was low (2.5 %). Conti￾nence was able to be maintained in all patients and the ability to
get an erection was preserved in 81.5 % of patients [69].
Cryoablation of the prostate can also be used as salvage ther￾apy. The largest patient collective including 297 reported patients
in a salvage situation is from the database of the COLD register.
The 5-year survival rate after cryotherapy is 97 % with a biochem￾ical tumor-free 5-year survival rate of 58.9 % [70]. The complica￾tion rates are higher in this situation than in native ablation. In
the last analysis of the database of the COLD register, the inconti￾nence rate was 1.6 % after focal ablation versus 12.3 % after abla￾tion in the salvage situation [68].
Initial data regarding MRI-guided cryoablation of the prostate
as an innovative approach is available. Gangi et al. reported on 11

patients who underwent MRI-guided cryoablation of the entire
prostate. With technical success in 10/11 patients, only one major
complication with a spontaneously healing rectourethral fistula
occurred [71]. Bomers et al. reported similar data regarding focal
MRI-guided cryoablation in the case of relapse after radiation
therapy of prostate cancer. A current study regarding MRI-guided
cryoablation in the case of relapse after radiation therapy in 47 pa￾tients shows control of the disease in only 24 (51 %) of the pa￾tients after 12 months while residual or recurrent tumor was
detected in the remaining 23 patients [72]. Initial data regarding
the use of focal MRI-guided cryoablation as the primary treatment
in patients with low to average risk showed a technical success
rate of 100 % in 10 patients and primary clinical success in 9/10
patients (▶ Fig. 1). One patient required reintervention due to
initially incomplete ablation [73].
Miscellaneous
Successful use of cryoablation in oncology for treating malignan￾cies of the adrenal gland or in the head-neck region has also been
described [74, 75]. Particularly in a palliative indication, the low
morbidity is an advantage of local ablative therapies.
Cryoablation of the pancreas deserves special attention. This
organ represents a particular challenge due to specific and serious
complication risks. Cryoablation with the preservation of fibro￾blasts and thus connective tissue structures provides an at least
theoretical advantage over other ablative techniques. The first
clinical case series regarding pancreatic cryoablation was already
reported in 1991 [76]. Since then, numerous reports on this topic
have been published. For example, in a retrospective series includ￾ing 32 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, Niu et al. report
a 1-year overall survival rate of 59.7 % after cryoablation of the
pancreas. The positive side effects such as reduction of pain med￾ication (22/32) and improvement of the Karnofsky Index (16/32)
are particularly important [77]. A current overview describes the
current status of cryotherapy of the pancreas, albeit in a small
clinical case series, as a notable treatment option [78].
In addition to the oncological applications described above, the
successful use of cryotherapy for the treatment of numerous benign
entities has also been described. Therefore, cryoablation has a suc￾cess rate for example in the treatment of osteoid osteomas similar
to that of other percutaneous ablation techniques with a clinical
success rate of 90.5 % to 100 % (▶ Fig. 3a – c) [79, 80]. Case series
also report the successful treatment of painful lesions such as Mor￾ton's neuromas or neuromas after amputation [81, 82]. Cryotherapy
as a monotherapy or part of a combination therapy for treating vas￾cular malformations is a newer application [83, 84]. The value of the
latter indications for cryotherapy is currently still unclear since only
low-quality case series have been reported. However, this shows the
major potential of this type of treatment outside of typical oncolo￾gical applications.
Outlook
Immunoablation
Since the introduction of immunotherapy in the routine treat￾ment of various malignancies, there has been significant interest
in the immune-modulating effects of cryoablation. These are ulti￾mately due to the fact that antigenic material remains in the body
after local ablation. Necrotic tissue releases damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). These include heat-shock proteins,
S100 proteins, non-protein components, and nucleic acids. Var￾ious immunostimulation pathways are activated via dendritic cells
that phagocytize these DAMPs. This is also referred to as in-vivo
dendritic cell vaccine by some authors [85]. Cryoablation produ￾ces the strongest immune-stimulating response as shown by in￾terleukins or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [86]. However, the
resulting apoptosis also has an immunosuppressive effect [87].
Experiments involving various combinations of cryoablation and
immunotherapy have already been performed. Therefore, it was
able to be shown in melanomas in a mouse model that the combi￾nation of cryotherapy and CpG-B oligodeoxynucleotides results in
significantly more effective tumor control and even regression of
▶ Fig. 3 A 29-year-old female patient presented with the typical clinical and imaging findings of an osteoid osteoma of the left tibia a. The lesion
was treated with cryoablation. After CT-guided drilling, the cryoprobe was placed inside the nidus of the lesion b. The day after the procedure the
patient was free of pain. MRI on the second day after the procedure showed no contrast enhancement of the nidus of lesion (arrow), but there was
some periostal and soft tissue swelling with moderate contrast enhancement at the rim of the ablated area (arrowheads, c).

secondary tumors compared to monotherapy [85]. Similar results
could also be shown for the combination of cryoablation with Imi￾quimod, a TLR7 agonist and stimulator of dendritic cells [88]. The
combination of CTLA-4 antibodies and cryoablation also improves
the treatment result [89]. The combination of cryotherapy and
cyclophosphamide yielded a survival advantage in colorectal cancer
in a mouse model. Suppression of regulatory T-cells with an increase
in tumor-specific T-cells was detected [90]. The combination of
cryoablation and anti-CTD25 antibodies also has a synergistic effect
resulting in prolonged survival in the animal model [89].
Initial clinical data regarding cryoimmunotherapy of pancreatic
cancer is promising [91]. The examination of these effects and
transfer to the clinical routine represent important challenges for
the near future of local ablation.
Combination therapy
Due to the decreasing effectiveness of cryotherapy with respect to
the periphery with only partial cell destruction in the range of -20 to
0 °C with simultaneous reparative processes with hyperemia and in￾flammation, this is the ideal target region for combination thera￾pies. Only minimal data in this regard is currently available. Various
experimental approaches were used to examine the combination of
cryotherapy and systemic chemotherapy. A combination effect in
terms of improved survival in the animal model was seen for various
substances, e. g. for cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil [90, 92].
With synchronized administration in contrast to preinterventional
administration, trapping of the substance in the cryolesion could
be shown for peplomycin and bleomycin [93, 94]. Combination
therapy similar to electrochemotherapy also seems possible since
local cryoablation in melanoma cells results in an increase in the
permeability of cell walls for bleomycin [95].
A survival advantage of a combination of cryotherapy and che￾motherapy in colorectal cancer compared to chemotherapy alone
could be shown in a clinical case series in the case of metastasized
colorectal cancer [96].
Combination with transarterial techniques has only been insuf￾ficiently examined. A large series regarding cryotherapy of colo￾rectal liver metastases combined cryotherapy with TACE in 280
of 526 patients with liver metastases of colorectal tumors treated
with cryotherapy. The local progression rate after 32 months was
6.4 % [97]. Further promising reports regarding combination ther￾apy for sarcomas are available [98]. Although this combination
therapy is an obvious combination based on experience with
hyperthermic ablation techniques, there is insufficient data
regarding the evaluation of these therapies.
Cryotherapy also has the potential to increase the radiosensi￾tivity of various tissues. This has been known for some time from
in-vitro studies [99] and was clinically confirmed also for pancre￾atic and lung cancer in small case series [100, 101].
Summary
In summary, there is now sufficient evidence to justify the use of
percutaneous cryotherapy as an effective and relatively pain-free
treatment alternative to surgical or other percutaneous treatment
techniques. The good visualization of the ice ball in cryotherapy
improves control compared to other ablative techniques and also
offers the potential to effectively and safely treat tumors in critical
locations. However, there are still no prospective randomized
studies with respect to the effectiveness of this type of treatment
compared to surgical methods and to combination with systemic
chemotherapy or immunotherapy. For combination therapy and
particularly immunoablation, the available data indicates a signif￾icant advantage for patients.
