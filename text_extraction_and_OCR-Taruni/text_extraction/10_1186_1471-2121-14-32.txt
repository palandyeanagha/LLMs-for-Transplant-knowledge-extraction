Abstract
Background: Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is regulated by the Bcl-2 family and caspase
family of proteins. The caspase cascade responsible for executing cell death following cytochrome c release is well
described; however the distinct roles of caspases-9, -3 and -7 during this process are not completely defined.
Results: Here we demonstrate several unique functions for each of these caspases during cell death. Specific inhibition
of caspase-9 allows for efficient release of cytochrome c, but blocks changes in mitochondrial morphology and ROS
production. We show that caspase-9 can cleave Bid into tBid at amino acid 59 and that this cleavage of Bid is required
for ROS production following serum withdrawal. We also demonstrate that caspase-3-deficient MEFs are less sensitive
to intrinsic cell death stimulation, yet have higher ROS production. In contrast, caspase-7-deficient MEFs are not
resistance to intrinsic cell death, but remain attached to the ECM.
Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that caspase-9 is required for mitochondrial morphological
changes and ROS production by cleaving and activating Bid into tBid. After activation by caspase-9, caspase-3
inhibits ROS production and is required for efficient execution of apoptosis, while effector caspase-7 is required for
apoptotic cell detachment.

Background
Intrinsic apoptosis is a mitochondrion-centered cell death
that is mediated by mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP), results in apoptosome forma￾tion, activation of caspase-9 and subsequent activation of
effector caspases. Growth factor withdrawal and intracellu￾lar stress can induce apoptosis through the intrinsic cell
death pathway, while extrinsic apoptosis is initiated through
transmembrane death receptors. Initiation and execution of
these processes are regulated by the BCL-2 and caspase
families of proteins [1,2]. Activation of the BCL-2 family
members Bax and Bak results in MOMP and the release of
pro-apoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c, from the
inter-membrane space into the cytosol [3-5]. Cytochrome c
can then bind Apaf-1 forming the apoptosome and
activating caspase-9. Once active, caspase-9 can directly
cleave and activate caspase-3 and caspase-7 [6,7].
Effector caspases are responsible for initiating the hall￾marks of the degradation phase of apoptosis, including
DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage and membrane bleb￾bing [8,9]. Other characteristics of apoptosis include, mito￾chondrial remodeling, ROS production and cleavage of a
variety of proteins, but the role of caspases in these pro￾cesses is not fully understood [9-12]. We have previously
shown that during intrinsic cell death stimulation caspase￾9 and effector caspases have sequential and distinct effects
on mitochondria. Caspase-9 can prevent accessibility of
cytochrome c to complex III in the mitochondria, resulting
in increased ROS production, but in the presence of ef￾fector caspase activity, ROS production is terminated [13].
Taken together, these data suggest a possible feedback loop
on the mitochondria after cytochrome c release and
caspase activation. Previous studies show that caspase-8
can cleave Bid into tBid, which can remodel the mitochon￾dria, but the role of tBid in intrinsic apoptosis has not been
determined [10]. Also, previous data have shown that

caspase-9 is a highly specific protease that only cleaves
a few proteins, where as caspase-3 and caspase-7 con￾tribute to the majority of cleavage that takes place dur￾ing apoptosis, but the distinct roles of each caspase is
not understood [14]. Based on cleavage-specificity pro￾files for caspase-3 and caspase-7, it was believed that
these caspases were essentially redundant in regards to
substrate cleavage during apoptosis [15,16]. However,
recent data suggests that caspase-3 and caspase-7 must
have distinct functions because mice deficient in these
caspases have distinct phenotypes and caspase-3 and
caspase-7 have differential activity toward synthetic,
natural and purified substrates [17,18]. Therefore, more
research needs to be conducted looking into the distinct
functions of each caspase during intrinsic apoptosis.
To address these issues, we used genetically manipulated
cell lines to study the distinct functions of caspase-9,
caspase-3 and caspase-7 during intrinsic cell death stimu￾lation. Here, we show that caspase-9 can remodel mito￾chondria and increase ROS production by cleaving Bid
into tBid. Also, caspase-3 can inhibit ROS production and
is the effector caspase necessary for efficient cell killing. In
contrast, caspase-7 has no significant role in sensitivity to
intrinsic cell death, but it is responsible for ROS produc￾tion and cell detachment. Taken together, these data sug￾gest that caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 have distinct
roles during intrinsic apoptosis.
Results
Caspase-9-cleavable Bid is necessary for ROS production
during apoptosis
FL5.12 cells are a pro-B cell line dependent on IL-3 and
can be used as a model for intrinsic apoptosis activation.
During IL-3 withdrawal, FL5.12 cells release cytochrome c
from the mitochondria and the mitochondria change from
a normal morphology with numerous narrow cristae
surrounded by electron-dense mitochondrial matrix to a
remodeled morphology with a large electron-transparent
intracristal space. However, introduction of a dominant
negative Casp9 inhibits mitochondrial remodeling without
affecting the release of cytochrome c (Data not shown)
[13]. These data suggest that caspase-9 is responsible for
mitochondrial remodeling downstream of MOMP during
IL-3 withdrawal. It has been shown that Bid can remodel
the mitochondria after cleavage by caspase-8 into tBid,
therefore we examined if caspase-9 could cleave Bid [10].
We show that during IL-3 withdrawal of FL5.12 cells
(Neo), Bid expression is lost and there is depolarization of
the mitochondria. However, Bid expression can be rescued
by expression of Bcl-xL or Casp9DN, but not CrmA, a
caspase-8 inhibitor (Figure 1A and B). Also, blockade with
BocD-fmk or Casp9DN causes an incomplete depo￾larization of the mitochondria, while CrmA has no effect
on loss of ΔΨm (Figure 1B). Since loss of Bid and loss of
ΔΨm were rescued by inhibition of caspase-9 and not in￾hibition of caspase-8, we examined if caspase-9 could dir￾ectly cleave Bid. Caspases are known to cleave Bid at three
sites, Asp98, Asp75 and Asp59, therefore we determined the
sites caspase-9 was cleaving Bid [19]. Bid mutants,
BidD98A, BidD75A, BidD59A, were incubated with increasing
concentrations of recombinant caspase-9 and while
BidD98A and BidD75A were cleaved by caspase-9, BidD59A
was not (Figure 1C). These data suggest that caspase-9
can cleave Bid into tBid at aspartic acid 59, which would
be consistent with the ability of tBid to function in remod￾eling the mitochondria during intrinsic cell death.
To further study the affects of caspase-9 cleavage of Bid,
we reconstituted Bid-/- MEFs with wild-type Bid, the cleav￾age mutant BidD59A or with vector control (pBabe) in order
to test the significance of Bid cleavage during intrinsic cell
death (Figure 1D). Caspases can regulate ROS production
during apoptosis and we have previously shown that in the
absence of effector caspase activity, caspase-9 can cause in￾creased ROS production [13]. Therefore, we determined
the role of caspase-9 cleavage of Bid on ROS production.
Bid-/- pBabe, Bid-/- Bid, and Bid-/- BidD59A MEFs were
subjected to serum withdrawal for 12 hours in the presence
or absence of BocD-fmk and ROS production was deter￾mined. Bid-/- pBabe MEFs show no increase in ROS pro￾duction after serum withdrawal, even when effector
caspases are inhibited by BocD-fmk, suggesting that ROS
production is not initiated by serum withdrawal in the ab￾sence of Bid. In contrast, Bid-/- MEFs reconstituted with
Bid display an increase in ROS production, which is mod￾estly increased by BocD-fmk treatment, therefore Bid is ne￾cessary for ROS production, while effector caspase activity
can inhibit ROS production. However, when Bid-/- BidD59A
MEFs are subjected to serum withdrawal there is no in￾crease in ROS production, suggesting that caspase-9 cleav￾age of Bid is necessary for ROS production during intrinsic
apoptosis (Figure 1E).
Effector caspase-3 and caspase-7 have distinct roles
during apoptosis
Our previous studies demonstrated that blocking caspases
downstream of MOMP resulted in a partial block in loss
of ΔΨm [13]. Figure 1B demonstrated that blockade with
Casp9DN or BocD-fmk results in an incomplete depo￾larization of mitochondria, while CrmA has no effect on
loss of ΔΨm. This suggests that the initial loss of ΔΨm is
caspase independent and likely reflects the effects of
MOMP. Consistent with this possibility, Bcl-xL expression
blocks loss of ΔΨm. However, we have shown that incom￾plete depolarization does not necessarily result in ROS pro￾duction, as inhibition of caspase-9 does not induce ROS
[13]. This suggests that the requirements for ROS produc￾tion and total loss of ΔΨm are independent. While
caspase-9 cleavage of Bid can account for the generation of

ROS, the data suggests that accumulation of ROS is related
to downstream inhibition of caspase-3 and/or caspase-7 by
BocD-fmk. We have previously shown that BocD-fmk
inhibits all DEVDase activity during IL-3 withdrawal￾induced death [13]. Therefore, our previous studies could
not discriminate between inhibition of caspase-3 and
caspase-7. To determine if caspase-3 and caspase-7 play
specific roles in the regulation of ROS production during
intrinsic cell death, WT, Casp7-/-, Casp3-/- and Casp3-/-7-/-
MEFs were subjected to serum withdrawal for 12 hours
and ROS production was determined. Casp KO MEFs did
not compensate for the loss of one effector caspase by in￾creasing expression of the other caspase (Figure 2A). WT
MEFs display an increase in ROS production after serum
withdrawal and consistent with our findings in IL-3 with￾drawal and chemotherapy-induced death, this is aug￾mented by the addition of BocD-fmk [13,20]. Interestingly,
Casp7-/- MEFs display no increase in ROS production fol￾lowing serum withdrawal and surprisingly BocD-fmk had
no effect on ROS production. In contrast, in Casp3-/- MEFs
an increase in ROS production during serum withdrawal is
observed and this is not altered by addition of BocD-fmk
(Figure 2B). Together these data suggest that caspase-3
is responsible for limiting ROS production, however
they also suggest that caspase-7 may contribute to ROS
production. To directly test this possibility, ROS produc￾tion was determined following serum withdrawal of
caspase-3/caspase-7 DKO MEFs. Consistent with the pos￾sibility that caspase-7 plays a role in the production of
ROS, no increase in ROS production was observed
(Figure 2B).
During the course of these studies, we noted differences
between cell lines in the amount of cell death and the
number of adherent cells remaining following serum with￾drawal. Therefore, we wanted to further identify if specific
effector caspases were responsible for these phenotypes. A
serum withdrawal time course was completed and cell
death and percent detachment were determined. While
loss of caspase-7 provided no protection from serum
withdrawal-induced cell death, caspase-3-deficient cells
displayed significant protection. Moreover this protection
was not different in DKO cells (Figure 3A). These data

suggest that caspase-3 is the dominant executioner caspase
and that caspase-7 activation is neither necessary nor suffi￾cient for serum withdrawal-induced cell death. Following
serum withdrawal, cell death of WT MEFs correlated with
percent of detachment suggesting that all dead cells were
detached from the ECM. Casp3-/- MEFs displayed a correl￾ation between cell death and cell detachment following
serum withdrawal, while less cells died, the ones that did
had detached from the ECM. In contrast, Casp7-/- and
Casp3-/-7-/- MEFs had significantly lower levels of cell de￾tachment when compared to cell death suggesting that
dead cells remained attached to the ECM (Figure 3B). To
examine the morphology of dead cells that remained at￾tached to the ECM, we performed a 48-hour serum with￾drawal on Casp7−/− MEFs and determined changes in actin
organization and DNA by fluorescent microscopy. In
complete medium all Casp7−/− MEFs display numerous
distinct actin stress fibers and actin rich cell protrusions
with a large round nuclei. However, after serum starva￾tion some attached cells display morphological changes
consistent with apoptosis, including cell rounding,
membrane blebbing, and condensed and fragmented
nuclei (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data indicate
that caspase-7 is responsible for cell detachment during
intrinsic cell death.
Since these MEFs were developed in the absence
caspase-3 or caspase-7, we wanted to determine that the
cell death and detachment effects were a direct conse￾quence of the absence of the caspase and not due to
changes in the development of the MEFs. In order to test
these possibilities, we introduced caspase-3 (C3) and
caspase-7 (C7) into the caspase-3-deficient MEFs or
caspase-7-deficient MEFs, respectively and determined if
the reconstituted MEFs revert to a WT phenotype.
Caspase-deficient cell lines that stably express C3 or C7
were made by retroviral transduction and selected with
puromycin, pBabe-puro was used as an empty vector con￾trol. C3 and C7 expression was determined by western
blot and C3 expression levels are comparable to endogen￾ous level in WT MEFs, while C7 is expressed at much
higher levels (Figure 4A). We found that Casp3−/− MEFs
reconstituted with C3 died at the same rate as WT MEFs
during a serum withdrawal time course (Figure 4B). Also,
in Casp7−/− MEFs reconstituted with C7 the percent of
cell death correlated with the percent of cell detachment,
suggesting that in the presence of C7 all dead cells de￾tached from the ECM (Figure 4C). Taken together, these
data indicate that caspase-3 is the dominant executioner
caspase and caspase-7 regulates cell detachment during
intrinsic cell death.
Discussion
While the caspase proteolytic cascade that executes in￾trinsic apoptosis following cytochrome c release is well
described, the distinct roles of each caspase during this
process are less understood. It has been shown that
these caspases have effects on the mitochondria and on
upstream events of intrinsic apoptosis, even though they
are thought to act downstream of cytochrome c release.
Caspase-9 has been shown to uncouple the mitochon￾dria and increase ROS production, while cells deficient
in caspase-3 or caspase-7 show a delay in the mitochon￾drial events of intrinsic apoptosis [13,17,20]. Caspase-3
and caspase-7 have been shown to have differential ac￾tivity toward multiple substrates, including Bid, XIAP
and gelsolin, which suggests a non-redundant role for
these related caspases [18]. Taken together, these data
suggest that caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 have
distinct roles during apoptosis and that there may be a
feedback loop on the mitochondria as well as additional
upstream functions.
We used IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis and a
Casp9DN to study the roles of caspase-9 during intrinsic
apoptosis. We found that caspase-9 is necessary to re￾model the mitochondria during intrinsic apoptosis and
the ability of Casp9DN to inhibit mitochondrial

remodeling while having no effect on cytochrome c re￾lease demonstrates that these events do not have to be
linked. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for tBid
in the remodeling of mitochondria [10]. However, cleavage
of Bid to tBid prior to MOMP does not occur in most
forms of intrinsic cell death, including growth factor
withdrawal. This is confirmed in this report as Bcl-xL
blocks cytochrome c release (Data not shown) as well as
Bid cleavage (Figure 1) during IL-3 withdrawal. There￾fore, if Bid is involved in the mitochondrial remodeling

observed during IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death it
would have to be cleaved by a caspase activated after
MOMP. Since caspase-8 and caspase-9 cleave caspase-3
at the same site, we reasoned that caspase-9 could
cleave Bid at the same site as caspase-8 and result in
tBid generation post MOMP [1]. Our data indicate that
caspase-9 can cleave Bid at Asp59 and suggest that Bid
is cleaved in a caspase-9 dependent manner following
IL-3 withdrawal of FL5.12 cells. Unfortunately, limita￾tions in the ability to detect endogenously generated
tBid prevent us from formally demonstrating this. How￾ever, we found that Bid-deficient MEFs display
decreased ROS production and that introduction of
wild-type, but not cleavage-defective Bid (BidD59A),
could restore the ROS production associated with
serum withdrawal. Additionally, in the presence of
BocD-fmk, ROS increased in the reconstituted cells.
Taken together, these data strongly implicate tBid in
mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs after MOMP
and based on the work of Scorrano and colleagues, tBid
is creating a favorable condition for ROS production
through mitochondrial remodeling [10].
While caspase-9 cleavage of Bid appears to initiate
ROS production following cytochrome c release, an ef￾fector caspase can extinguish ROS through complete
depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
However, the specific effector caspase required for
depolarization is not known. Therefore, we used serum
withdrawal-induced cell death in Casp KO MEFs to
study the distinct effects of caspase-3 and caspase-7 on
mitochondrial function during intrinsic apoptosis. Our
results show that caspase-3 is decreasing ROS production,
while caspase-7 may be required for ROS accumulation.
Normally, the mitochondria maintain a membrane poten￾tial (ΔΨm) and shuttle electrons across the ETC with min￾imal ROS production, which can occur at complex III
[21]. During apoptosis stimulation, there is a loss of cyto￾chrome c from the mitochondria, which is needed to
transfer electrons from complex III to IV, resulting in loss
of electrons from the ETC and ROS production [22]. If

import of substrates to the ETC is stopped by loss of
ΔΨm, or electron transport through complex III is
blocked, ROS production is diminished [13]. Therefore,
after cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation,
caspase-3 is needed to inhibit electron transport through
the ETC and/or lower ΔΨm in order to decrease ROS pro￾duction. This indicates that caspase-9 generation of tBid
and remodeling of the mitochondria may represent the
‘point of no return’ in apoptosis and that caspase-3 as￾sures that this does not result in loss of integrity of the
apoptotic cell.
Here, we demonstrate that MEFs deficient in caspase￾7 die at the same rate as WT MEFs, while caspase-3-de￾ficient MEFs have a delay in cell death during serum
withdrawal. The data suggests that caspase-3 is the dom￾inant executioner caspase, while caspase-7 may have
other roles, which is in agreement with data on substrate
specificity [18]. Consistent with this model, reintroduc￾tion of caspase-3 into caspase-3-deficient MEFs resulted
in cell lines with expression levels similar to endogenous
expression. In contrast, cells could tolerate significantly
higher levels of caspase-7 upon reintroduction. Thus it
is unlikely that caspase-7 functions primarily to kill cells.
We show that caspase-7 functions to detach cells from
the ECM, which may suggest that caspase-7 functions to
aid in the removal of apoptotic cells. In vivo, apoptotic
cells can have a profound effect on the microenviron￾ment and it is necessary to regulate these processes and
efficiently remove dead cells [19]. Caspase-7 may con￾tribute to this removal process by hastening the detach￾ment of cells from the ECM. Caspases are known to
cleave a variety of actin and cytoskeleton components,
but the specific components important for detachment
and cleaved by caspase-7 are yet to be determined. Inter￾estingly, an early report demonstrated that FAK is an
apoptotic substrate that is preferentially cleaved by
caspase-7. However, this study was performed in non￾adherent cells, therefore it is difficult to fully appreciate
the significance of these data [23]. The current studies
shed new light on this finding.
Conclusions
Taken together, our data suggest distinct roles for caspase￾9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 during intrinsic apoptosis
(Figure 5). Caspase-9 is activated post cytochrome c re￾lease and functions to activate effector caspases and Bid in
order to remodel the mitochondria. This would assure
that cells that have an active apoptosome will still die in
the absence of effector caspases. However, cell death is
more efficient in the presence of caspase-3, which is the
primary executioner of apoptotic death. In contrast, while
caspase-7 plays no role in the sensitivity to intrinsic apop￾tosis, it can cause an accumulation of ROS production
and functions to detach cells from the ECM. This is
consistent with caspase-7 primarily playing a supportive
role in the execution phase of apoptosis. We have found
that each caspase has a distinct role in apoptosis, which
suggests that the caspases involved in the proteolytic cas￾cade post cytochrome c release must work together to ef￾fectively and efficiently execute all aspects of apoptosis.
Methods
Cell culture
FL5.12 cells are a murine pro-B cell line that is IL-3
dependent and were cultured and transfected as previ￾ously described [20,24]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modification of
Eagle’s Medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bo￾vine serum (FBS, Cellgro), 1% non-essential amino acids
(Cellgro), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Cellgro), 55 μM 2-
Mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamate (Cellgro)
and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Cellgro) at 37°C in
a humid 5% CO2 incubator. When indicated, BocD-fmk
was used at a concentration of 100 μM. MEFs were
infected with retrovirus generated by transfecting the
ΦNX-Ecotropic cell line (Nolan lab, Stanford University)
with a plasmid (pBabe-puro, pBabe-Bid or pBabe-BidD59A)
using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) [25].
ΦNX-Ecotropic packaging cell lines (Nolan lab,
Stanford University) were transfected with pBabe-puro,
Casp3 pBabe-puro or Casp7 pBabe-puro using Lipo￾fectamine (Invitrogen). Target MEFs were seeded in 6-
well plates and allowed to grow for 24 hours and then
infected with viral supernatants at 24, 28, and 32 hours
using Polybrene Infection / Transfection Reagent
(Millipore). After 24 hours viral supernatants were re￾moved from the target cells and replaced with fresh
Figure 5 Model of caspase activation downstream of
cytochrome c release during apoptosis. Cell death signals induce
MOMP, which leads to cytochrome c release and the activation of
caspase-9. Caspase-9 can cleave and activate Bid, caspase-7 and
caspase-3. tBid can remodel the mitochondria and make conditions
favorable for ROS production, which is enhanced by caspase-7 and
inhibited by caspase-3.

medium for 24-72 hours and then they were selected
with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma).
Cell death induction and analysis
IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death in FL5.12 cells was
conducted as previously described [13]. For serum
withdrawal-induced apoptosis, medium was aspirated
from MEFs, they were washed with PBS and serum-free
medium was added for indicated time points. Cell death
was assayed by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide
and analyzed on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Bio￾sciences). Percent detachment was determined by separ￾ating non-adherent and adherent cells and counting on
a hemocytometer. Significance was determined by t-test
using Prism software.
Microscopy and mitochondrial assays
Fluorescent-confocal microscopy for actin and DNA was
conducted by fixing cells as previously described and
staining with phalloidin (Cell Signaling) for 20 min and
mounting the coverslips with Prolong Gold with DAPI
(Molecular Probes) [13]. Mitochondrial membrane poten￾tial and ROS production were assayed as previously
described [13,20].
Caspase-9 cleavage of bid
Bid mutants (BidD98A, BidD75A, and BidD59A) were created
by site directed mutagenesis. In vitro translated Bid,
BidD98A, BidD75A, or BidD59A was exposed to 0, 5, 10 Units
of recombinant caspase-9 for 90 min at 37°C and Bid
cleavage was assessed by western blot.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as previously described
[24]. Primary antibodies: mouse anti-Bid (Stanley
Korsmeyer), rabbit anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti-Actin
(Sigma). Secondary antibodies: horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated sheep anti-mouse and horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham). Proteins were
detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham).
