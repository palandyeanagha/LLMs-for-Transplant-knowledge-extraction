ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin associated with oxidative stress. 
The present study aimed to investigate the presence of oxidative stress in patients with newly diagnosed SLE. SLE 
patients (n = 36) and control subjects (n = 28) were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were used for malondialdehyde 
(MDA), sulfhydryl groups (SH) and uric acid determination. MDA levels (µmol/L) were higher in patients (3.9 ± 2.6) 
than in control subjects (1.6 ± 2.6). SH were signifi cantly lower in SLE patients. The fi ndings suggest that MDA can be 
a good marker of oxidative stress in SLE. 
Keywords: oxidative stress, antioxidants, lupus erythematosus systemic, uric acid.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoim￾mune disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical 
manifestations with multiple autoantibody production and 
complement-fi xing immune complex deposition that result 
in tissue’ damage.1
 Although the specifi c cause of SLE is 
unknown, several studies associate this disease to defective 
cellular and humoral immunity, probably infl uenced by ge￾netic, environmental, and hormonal factors.2,3
Free radicals and other reactive oxygen/nitrogen/chlo￾rine species are believed to contribute to the development 
of several chronic diseases by causing oxidative stress and 
oxidative damage. Diseases in which oxidative damage has 
been implicated include cancer, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s 
disease, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases.4–8
Most clinical studies focus on the measurement of 
oxidative damage by using biomarkers – oxidants and an￾tioxidants. Malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidation product 
of lipoperoxidation, has been found elevated in various 
diseases.9
 Sulfhydryl (SH) groups (thiols) are considered the 
biggest and most frequently antioxidants in plasma.10 Several 
experimental studies pointed to a qualitatively and quantita￾tively important role of uric acid as an antioxidant substance 
acting as a free radical scavenger and a chelator of transitional 
metal ions which are converted to poorly reactive forms.11
The purpose of this study was to determine the presence 
of oxidative stress in SLE patients by determining these bio￾markers in blood samples. Parameters were correlated with 
disease activity and comorbidities; results were compared 
with normal subjects in the control group. 
The study included 36 patients with SLE and 28 healthy 
volunteers (control) between the ages of 10 and 56. The diag￾nosis was based on at least four of the 11 diagnostic criteria es￾tablished by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).12
All patients were in treatment and the disease activity was 
assessed by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Active Index (SLEDAI). Disease was considered active when 
SLEDAI > 6.13 The protocol of the study was approved by the 
Ethical Committee for Human Research from Universidade 
Federal do Amazonas (CAAE n. 0043.0.115.000.08). All 
patients and non-patients signed an informed consent form

before taking part in the study and were submitted to a stan￾dardized questionnaire for demographic factors. 
The venous blood collection (10 mL) from each participant 
was done with an evacuated tube system (BD Vacutainer® 
System) and centrifuged (800 g, 15 min). Serum was used 
for determining biochemical and immunological markers. 
MDA was determined by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC); chromatograms were monitored 
at 532 nm and the sample concentration was determined 
in µmol/L.14 Uric acid was measured using Cobas Mira® 
spectrophotometric analyzer (Roche Instruments Inc.), with 
commercially available kits (Labtest, Minas Gerais, Brazil). 
SH groups were determined by the Ellmans method, modifi ed 
by Hu et al.15 The results were expressed as means ± standard 
deviation (SD). Student’s t-distribution was used to compare 
mean values. Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations were 
applied to correlate the parameters with SLEDAI. P < 0.05 
was considered to be statistically signifi cant.
General and demographic characteristics of SLE patients 
and healthy controls are presented in Table 1. There was also 
no difference between duration, criteria number, and activity 
of the disease and oxidative stress (P > 0.05).
Lupus is characterized by direct aggression of autoanti￾bodies and complement-fi xing immune complex deposition 
that result in tissues’ damage associated to oxidative stress.16
Waszczykowska et al.,17 suggested that intracellular free 
radicals are capable of inducing cytokine synthesis that 
participate and modulate infl ammatory responses with the 
creation of superoxide radicals. 
Oxidative stress, measured by MDA levels, was found 
increased in 78.9% (n = 30) of SLE patients, while only 
21.1% (n = 8) of normal controls presented that increase 
(OR = 12.5; 95% CI 3.7–41.5). As shown in Table 2, MDA 
levels were found to be signifi cantly increased in SLE patients 
compared to normal controls. No signifi cant difference was 
found between MDA levels and the duration of the disease or 
comorbidities. Increased level of MDA in the serum18 and in 
the erythrocytes19 was reported in SLE patients. Wang et al.20
and Shah et al.21 associated stronger oxidative stress response 
with higher SLEDAI scores, similar to the previous report of 
Tewthanom et al.18 However, we have not identifi ed, in our 
study, the association of MDA or SH levels with SLEDAI 
scores. The high levels of MDA in SLE patients indicate that 
the lipid cell membrane was attacked and that MDA can be a 
good marker of oxidative stress in this disease.
There was no signifi cant change in serum levels of uric 
acid in SLE patients compared to normal controls (4.1 ± 1.5 
and 3.8 ± 0.9 mg/dL, respectively). No correlation was found 
between the serum levels of this compound and disease activity. 
Deminice et al.22 associated uric acid as an oxidative stress bio￾marker response to an acute session of hypertrophy-resistance 
traditional interval training and circuit training. Ikeda et al.23, 
however, could not make the same association when oxidative 
stress was observed in patients with progressive amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis. Although uric acid is consider an important an￾tioxidant and its serum levels were expected to be lower in SLE 
patients than in normal controls, our study could not associate 
this substance as a secure biomarker of oxidative stress either. 
Morgan et al.24 showed that markers of protein oxidation 
correlate with worsening disease status in SLE. In our study, SH 
group levels were found to be signifi cantly decreased in SLE 
patients compared to normal controls (260.2 ± 182.7 versus
339.4 ± 104.3 µmol/L), similar to the report of Zhang et al.25 This 
supports the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of SLE. 
We concluded that SLE patients present increases in oxi￾dative stress. However, this response is not correlated to the 
disease activity or its duration. MDA and SH group levels 
can be used as biomarkers to measure oxidative stress in 
SLE patients, whereas uric acid cannot be used for the same 
purpose. Further studies on oxidative stress and SLE are 
still necessary to improve our understanding of the disease 
pathogenesis.
