Abstract
Background: In patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS), prognostic scores may identify those
with a poor prognosis or even those with a clear survival benefit.


The Child-Pugh score (CPS) is well established but several
drawbacks have led to development of the model of end stage liver
disease (MELD).
Aim: The aim of the study was to compare the predictive power of
CPS and MELD, to validate the original MELD formula, and to
assess the predictive value of the determinants used in the two
prognostic scores outside of a study setting.
Patients: A total of 501 patients underwent elective TIPS placement
and 475 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Methods: Data of all patients undergoing elective TIPS in one
university hospital and four community hospitals in Vienna,
Austria, between 1991 and 2001, were analysed retrospectively.
The main statistical tests were Cox proportional hazards regression
model, the log rank test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and concordance c
statistics.
Results: Median follow up was 5.2 years and median survival was
4.6 years. During follow up, 230 patients died, 75 within three
months after TIPS placement. In stepwise proportional hazards
analyses, independent predictors of death were creatinine level,
bilirubin level, age, and refractory ascites. MELD was better in
predicting survival in a stepwise Cox model but both scores were
equally predictive in c statistics for one month, three month, and
one year survival. Renal function was the strongest independent
predictor of survival.
Conclusions: Although MELD was the primary predictor of overall
survival in multivariate analysis, c statistics showed that both scores
can be used for patients undergoing TIPS with equal accuracy. For
assessing prognosis in patients undergoing TIPS implantation, there
seems little reason to replace the well established Child-Pugh score.
