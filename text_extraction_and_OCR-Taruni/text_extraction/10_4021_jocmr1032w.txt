Abstract
Background: Data was prospectively collected on 850 con￾secutive patients undergoing central venous catheterisation 
(CVC) to receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in a major 
university teaching hospital over a 46 months period.
Methods: Data included information about CVC insertion 
and clinical outcomes, most notably, suspected catheter-re￾lated blood stream infections (CRBSI).
Results: The internal jugular vein was the most common site 
(n = 882, 68%), followed by the subclavian vein (n = 344, 
24.6%) and femoral vein (n = 95, 6.5%). The CRBSI rate 
per 100 line feeding days was 0.93% in patients cared for in 
a non ICU setting versus 1.98% for ICU managed patients. 
The mean number of line days preceding a pyrexial spike 
was 13.1. CRBSI was commonest in patients with femo￾ral lines (n = 21/95, 22.1%), especially those cared for in a 
non-ICU setting (29.6% versus 14.5% for those in the ICU 
group). Preference should be given to internal jugular or sub￾clavian-sited CVCs in ICU and non-ICU patients to reduce 
the risk of CRBSI. If femoral catheterisation is unavoidable, 
strict attention to aseptic technique is mandatory.
Conclusion: The aim of this study was to investigate the rate 
and pattern of CRBSI and to recommend changes in pro￾tocol, technique and equipment as deemed necessary from 
these findings.

Introduction
Parenteral nutritional support involves the intravenous pro￾vision of calories, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, min￾erals, trace elements and fluids to meet the metabolic needs 
of critical illness or in patients for whom enteral nutrition 
is unsuitable or insufficient. Central venous catheterisation 
(CVC) is the route of choice for total parenteral nutrition 
(TPN) as its osmotic load is not well tolerated by periph￾eral veins. Access is most commonly via subclavian, internal 
jugular or femoral veins with tunnelled lines being used in 
less acute or more long-term situations. As well as the risk 
associated with their underlying condition, patients who re￾ceive parenteral nutritional support are at risk of catheter￾related blood stream infections (CRBSI), adverse metabolic 
effects, and complications related to venous access. We pro￾spectively collected data concerning a consecutive series of 
850 patients receiving TPN via CVC over a 4 year period. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the rate and pattern 
of CRBSI in a major university hospital and to recommend 
changes in protocol, technique and equipment as deemed 
necessary from these findings. 
Material and Methods
An epidemiological prospective study was conducted over a 
46 months period between March 2006 and December 2009 
in a large university teaching hospital in Dublin. All data was 
collected by a single observer, a parenteral nutrition nurse￾specialist. All patients receiving TPN in an ICU and non￾ICU setting were included. Informed consent was obtained 
from each patient prior to catherisation.
All CVCs were inserted using standard strict sterile pre￾cautions consistent with the Healthcare Infection Control

Practices Advisory Committee guidelines [1]. CVCs were 
sited by an anaesthetic consultant or registrar in either an ICU 
or operating theatre setting under strict aseptic conditions. A 
nursing protocol for care of central venous lines was in place 
and the nurse specialist inspected lines for compliance and 
for evidence of contamination. CVCs were removed if there 
was a suspicion of infection, when the catheter was no longer 
required and routinely after 14 days. As per standard practice 
when CRBSI was suspected the catheter was removed and 
the tip cultured for micro-organisms, blood cultures were 
sent and infection elsewhere was ruled out via a standard 
septic screen. Catheter related sepsis was defined as per the 
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines [2]. CRBSI 
was documented when other potential sources of infection 
were excluded and where a culture of the catheter tip demon￾strated substantial colonies of an organism identical to those 
found in the bloodstream.
The CVC insertion site, number of previous CVC in￾sertions, type of catheter, duration of central venous cath￾eterisation and events of CRBSI were recorded. The proce￾dural setting and grade of operator were recorded. Clinical 
septicaemia was recorded in the circumstance of systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome and associated pathogenic 
organisms identified in the blood. Those patients with clini￾cal septicaemia and identical organisms cultured from their 
blood and catheter tip were considered to have a CRBSI.
Results were analysed using Predictive Analytics Soft￾ware (PASW 18∙0∙2, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The effect 
of CVC type, site and procedural setting on CRBSI rates was 
expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter￾vals (CI). All tests of significance were 2-tailed. Results were 
considered significant where an OR did not equal 1, the 95% 
CI did not cross 1 and the p value was less than 0.05.
Results
A total of 850 patients underwent central venous catheterisa￾tion for total parenteral nutrition between March 2006 and 
December 2009. A total of 1,321 CVCs were sited; 529 in 
ICU-managed patients and 792 in non-ICU patients, 87 were 
inserted by a consultant anaesthetist and 1,234 by an anaes￾thetic registrar. Consultant-inserted CVCs were more likely 
to result in clinical sepsis but this did not reach significance 
(14.9% versus 11%; P = 0.225).
The percentage of CVC cases meeting bacteriological 
criteria for CRBSI and demonstrating clinical septicaemia 
in the ICU and non-ICU group was 11.2% and 12.1% re￾spectively (P = 0.602). Access was via an internal jugular 
vein in 882 cases (68%), the subclavian vein in 344 cases 
(24.6%) and femoral vein in 95 cases (6.5%) (Table 1). 
CVC-attributed clinical sepsis was highest in patients with 
femoral vein catheters, occurring in 21 of 95 cases (22.1%; 
95% CI 1.33 to 3.98, P < 0.003). CRBSI was more likely in 
jugular-sited lines (11.7%; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, P = 0.92) 
compared to subclavian lines (9.0%; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.05, P 
= 0.08). Triple lumen catheters were utilised most frequently 
(69%), followed by double (20%) and quadra (11%) lumen 
catheters. CRBSI was more likely with 3 or 4 lumen CVCs 
than a 2 lumen CVC which had a CRBSI rate similar to that 
of tunnelled lines (Table 2).
The total number of line feeding days was 4,753 days, 
3,495 for the ICU population and 1,258 for the non-ICU pop￾ulation. Sepsis per 100 line feeding days was 1.45% overall, 
0.93% in the non-ICU population compared to 1.98% in the 
ICU population.
Discussion
CVC-related bloodstream infection is suggested if a primary 
bloodstream infection develops in a patient who had a CVC 
in-situ within the preceding 48-hour period. Peripheral blood 
cultures positive for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-nega￾tive staphylococci or candida species in the absence of other 
identifiable infective sources should increase the suspicion 
for catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) [3].
As per CDC guidelines, CRBSI is confirmed when syn￾chronous peripheral blood stream and central venous cath￾eter tip cultures demonstrate substantial colonies of an iden￾tical organism.
Patients receiving parenteral nutrition via CVC are at 
increased risk of acquiring a bloodstream infection, com￾pared to those with CVCs for other indications [4]. Among 
patients receiving parenteral nutrition, factors independently 
associated with bloodstream infection include poor patient 
hygiene, emergency central venous catheterisation, and, to 
a lesser extent, the severity of illness and duration of cath￾eterisation [5].

1,000 catheter-days), clinical sepsis (4.5 versus 1.2 per 1,000 
catheter-days), and thrombotic complications in femoral 
versus subclavian CVCs. This study concurs, showing a sig￾nificant increase in line sepsis in patients with femoral vein 
catheters compared to other sites. Subclavian vein-sited lines 
were the least likely to result in CRBSI when compared to 
other sites. The subclavian vein should be the site of choice 
for CVCs followed by the internal jugular vein, avoiding use 
of the femoral vein where possible.
The risk of infection with central venous catheters in￾creases with the duration of use [6]. However, a defined time 
course for routine change of catheters has not been conclu￾sively established [7]. Vigilant clinical evaluation and as￾sessment of the catheter site should be performed at least 
every other day. We demonstrated that the mean number of 
days preceding a pyrexial spike with a CVC in-situ was 13.1. 
Our current hospital policy of routinely changing CVCs is 
14 days.
Several studies have shown multi-lumen catheters to 
have an increased rate of CRBSI when compared to single 
lumen catheters. There was no statistical difference in the 
rate of CRBSI in the different groups in our study although 
there was a trend toward an increased contamination rate in 
the higher lumen groups. Double lumen catheters had the 
lowest rate of CRBSI, a rate that was similar to that of tun￾nelled lines. Current evidence does not support the routine 
tunnelling of short-term catheters especially in an acute set￾ting therefore these results suggest double-lumen catheters 
should be considered an appropriate choice in the setting of 
TPN use.
Optimum hand hygiene and maximal barrier precau￾tions reduce the rate of CRBSI [8], however a 2006 report 
of intensive care units in 10 academic tertiary-care hospitals 
note a less than 30% compliance rate [9]. This suggests that 
compliance with strict sterile technique may somewhat ame￾liorate these and other results and reduce the rate of CRBSIs 
seen in hospitals.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our 4 year experience demonstrates that the 
location and number of lumens are important considerations 
when planning a CVC placement for TPN. Despite advances 
in sterile technique, management of lines and treatment of 
sepsis, CRBSI is still a significant cause of morbidity and 
potential mortality in critical care patients. Resulting from 
our prospective review, we recommend the routine change 
of CVC’s is 12 days.
