Abstract
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a significant challenge to effective cancer chemotherapy treatment. However, the
development of a drug delivery system that allows for the sustained release of combined drugs with improved vesicle
stability could overcome MDR in cancer cells. To achieve this, we have demonstrated codelivery of doxorubicin (Dox) and
paclitaxel (PTX) via a crosslinked multilamellar vesicle (cMLV). This combinatorial delivery system achieves enhanced drug
accumulation and retention, in turn resulting in improved cytotoxicity against tumor cells, including drug-resistant cells.
Moreover, this delivery approach significantly overcomes MDR by reducing the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cancer
cells, thus improving antitumor activity in vivo. Thus, by enhancing drug delivery to tumors and lowering the apoptotic
threshold of individual drugs, this combinatorial delivery system represents a potentially promising multimodal therapeutic
strategy to overcome MDR in cancer therapy.

Introduction
The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) against a
variety of conventional and novel chemotherapeutic agents has
been a major impediment to the success of cancer therapy [1,2].
One of the most important mechanisms involved in MDR is the
overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the plasma membrane
of various cancer cells. P-gp, an active drug efflux transporter, is
capable of effluxing a broad range of anticancer agents, such as
taxanes and anthracyclines [3]. For example, the efficacy of
doxorubicin (Dox) and paclitaxel (PTX), two of the most widely
used agents for the treatment of various cancers, is often
compromised by P-gp-mediated MDR [4,5]. Therefore, a strategy
to inhibit P-gp expression has been developed to overcome MDR.
For instance, a large number of P-gp inhibitors and siRNAs
targeting the gene encoding P-gp have been delivered in
combination with anticancer agents to downregulate P-gp
expression, thereby enabling drugs to reach sufficient concentra￾tions to induce cytotoxicity [6,7]. However, P-gp inhibitors, either
functional inhibitors or siRNA, have yielded disappointing clinical
trials resulting from their high systemic toxicities and enhanced
side effects of chemotherapy in normal cells [8,9].
Combination therapy with multiple chemotherapeutics provides
an alternative strategy to suppress MDR. Different drugs may
attack cancer cells at varying stages of their growth cycles, thus
decreasing the concentration threshold for individual drugs that is
otherwise required for cytotoxicity [10]. It has been reported that
various drug combinations have successfully induced synergistic
antitumor activities and prevented disease recurrence [11,12]. For
example, a Dox and PTX cocktail is now considered a standard
anthracycline-taxane combination treatment for various tumors by
their ability to overcome drug resistance [13,14,15]. However, a
major challenge of combination therapy is coordinating the
pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake of combined therapeutics.
This obstacle has limited the clinical success of combination
therapy [16,17].
To overcome this challenge, novel strategies that allow loading
of multiple therapeutics into a single drug-delivery vehicle for
concurrent delivery at the site of action have been extensively
explored [18,19]. Several drug delivery systems have been able to
intercalate multiple drugs for site-specific delivery to tumors and,
hence, improve antitumor activities, potentially overcoming drug
resistance, while, at the same time, reducing the dosage of
individual drugs [20,21,22]. Indeed, nanoparticle delivery systems
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e110611

are known to deliver therapeutics efficiently to the tumor sites
through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,
thereby enhancing the concentration of therapeutics in tumors
[23,24]. Moreover, these nanoparticles can enter cancer cells
through endocytosis in a manner independent of the P-gp
pathway, thereby enhancing cellular accumulation of therapeutics
[25,26,27]. Thus, a nanoparticle delivery system capable of
mediating high efficiency of cellular entry and subsequent
triggering of intracellular release of multiple anticancer drugs to
overcome MDR is highly desirable.
Liposomes are one of the most popular nanoparticle delivery
systems for combinatorial delivery of multiple drugs based on their
ability to efficiently load both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs
[24,28]. We previously developed a robust crosslinked multi￾lamellar liposomal vesicle (cMLV), with enhanced vesicle stability,
to efficiently codeliver hydrophilic (Dox) and hydrophobic (PTX)
drugs and induce ratio-dependent synergistic antitumor activity,
both in vitro and in vivo [29,30,31]. Moreover, it was shown that
cMLV particles are mainly internalized by cells through caveolin￾dependent endocytosis and are then trafficked through the
endosome-lysosome network for release of drugs [30]. In this
study, we have examined the potential of cMLV as a combina￾torial delivery system aimed at overcoming P-gp-mediated drug
resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, we have demon￾strated that the combination of Dox and PTX, when administered
at 1:1 weight ratio in cMLV formulations, shows significant
enhancement of cytotoxicity and antitumor activities. Combining
these drugs through the use of cMLV formulations contributes to
these antitumor activities by enhancing systemic delivery efficiency
and lowering tumor apoptotic threshold.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Female BALB/c mice (6–10 weeks old) were purchased from
Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All mice
were held under specific pathogen-reduced conditions in the
Animal Facility of the University of Southern California (USA). All
experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines set
by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Southern
California on the Care and Use of Animals. This study was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of the University of Southern California.
Cell culture
B16 tumor cells (B16–F10, ATCC number: CRL-6475) and
4T1 tumor cells (ATCC number: CRL-2539) were maintained in
a 5% CO2 environment with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 2 mM of L-glutamine
(Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Omaha, NE). B16-R and 4T1-R
cells were produced by continuously treating B16 and 4T1 cells
with 5 mg/ml PTX for 4 days. The cells were then recovered by
replacing medium with fresh medium without drugs for 7 days.
The remaining cells formed drug resistance for PTX. JC cells
(ATCC number: CRL-2116) were used as a model drug-resistant
tumor cell line because it has been shown that JC cells overexpress
P-gp and exhibit a drug-resistant phenotype, both in vitro and in
vivo [32].
Synthesis of cMLVs
Liposomes were prepared based on the conventional dehydra￾tion-rehydration method. All lipids were obtained from the NOF
Corporation (Japan). 1.5 mmol of lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(19-
rac-glycerol) (DOPG), and maleimide-headgrouplipid1,2-dio￾leoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoeth-anolamine-N-[4-(p-maleimidophe￾nyl) butyramide (MPB-PE) were combined in chloroform at a
molar lipid ratio of DOPC:DOPG:MPB = 4:1:5, and the organic
solvent in the lipid mixture was evaporated under argon gas. The
lipid mixture was further dried under vacuum overnight to form
dried thin lipid films. To prepare cMLV(PTX) and cMLV(Dox+
PTX) at a molar ratio of 0.2:1 (drugs:lipids), paclitaxel in organic
solvent was mixed with the lipid mixture to form dried thin lipid
films. The resultant dried film was hydrated in 10 mM Bis-Tris
propane at pH 7.0 with (cMLV(Dox) or cMLV(Dox+PTX)) or
without doxorubicin (cMLV(PTX)) at a molar ratio of 0.2:1
(drugs:lipids) with vigorous vortexing every 10 min for 1 h,
followed by applying 4 cycles of 15-s sonication (Misonix Microson
XL2000, Farmingdale, NY) on ice in 1-min intervals of each cycle.
To induce divalent-triggered vesicle fusion, MgCl2 was added at a
final concentration of 10 mM. The resulting multilamellar vesicles
were further crosslinked by addition of Dithiothreitol (DTT,
Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 1.5 mM for 1 h at 37uC.
The resulting vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 g
for 4 min and then washed twice with PBS. For pegylation of
cMLVs, the particles were incubated with 1 mmol of 2 kDa PEG￾SH (Laysan Bio Inc., Arab, AL) for 1 h at 37uC. The particles
were then centrifuged and washed twice with PBS. The final
products were stored in PBS at 4uC. The mean diameter of all
cMLVs is around 220 nm determined by dynamic light scattering
(DLS), and around 160 nm estimated by cryo-electron microsco￾py. The loading efficiency, and stability of cMLVs were similar to
that demonstrated previously [30,31].
In vitro cytotoxicity and data analysis
B16–F10, 4T1, B16–R, 4T1-R, and JC cells were plated at a
density of 56103 cells per well in D10 media in 96-well plates and
grown for 6 h. The cells were then exposed to a series of
concentrations of cMLV (single drug) or cMLV (drug combina￾tions) for 48 h. The cell viability was assessed using the Cell
Proliferation Kit II (XTT assay) from Roche Applied Science
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slope m and IC50
were obtained from median effect model, and IIPCmax was
calculated via the following equation: IIPCmax= log (1+(Cmax/
IC50)
m). Cmax is the maximum plasma drug concentrations for
the commonly recommended dose for each drug.
Cellular uptake of doxorubicin and paclitaxel in cells
4T1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 26105
cells per well and grown overnight. The cells were then exposed to
empty cMLVs (control), cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX), cMLV(Dox+
PTX), and Dox+PTX. The final concentrations of Dox and PTX
were 1 mg/ml for each group. JC cells were seeded at a density of
105 cells per well in D10 media in 96-well plates. The cells were
exposed to empty cMLVs, cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX),
cMLV(Dox+PTX), and Dox+PTX. The final concentrations of
Dox and PTX were 5 mg/ml for each group. At 48 h after
treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with
PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel in
cell lysates were extracted by 1:1 (v/v) Chloroform/isopropyl
alcohol or ethyl acetate, respectively. Paclitaxel concentrations in
cell lysates were measured by HPLC C18 column and detected at
227 nm (flow rate 1 ml/min), and doxorubicin was detected by
fluorescence with 480/550 nm excitation/emission. The concen￾trations of Dox and PTX were normalized for protein content as
measured with BCA assay (Pierce).

In vivo antitumor activity study
BALB/c female mice (6–10 weeks old) were inoculated
subcutaneously with 0.26106 4T1 breast tumor cells. The tumors
were allowed to grow for 8 days to a volume of ,50 mm3 before
treatment. After 8 days, the mice were injected intravenously
through the tail vein with cMLV(2 mg/kg Dox), cMLV(2 mg/kg
PTX), cMLV(2 mg/kg Dox)+cMLV(2 mg/kg PTX), or
cMLV(2 mg/kg Dox + 2 mg/kg PTX) every three days (six mice
per group). Tumor growth and body weight were monitored for 40
days or to the end of the experiment. The length and width of the
tumor masses were measured with a fine caliper every three days
after injection. Tumor volume was expressed as 1/2 6 (length 6
width2
). Survival end point was set when the tumor volume
reached 1000 mm3
. The survival rates are presented as Kaplan￾Meier curves. The survival curves of individual groups were
compared by a log-rank test.
Immunohistochemistry of tumors and confocal imaging
BALB/c female mice (6–10 weeks old) were inoculated
subcutaneously with 0.2 6 106 4T1 or JC tumor cells. The
tumors were allowed to grow for 20 days to a volume of ,500
mm3 before treatment. On day 20, the mice were injected
intravenously through the tail vein with cMLV (5 mg/kg Dox),
cMLV(5 mg/kg PTX), 5 mg/kg Dox + 5 mg/kg PTX, or
cMLV(5 mg/kg Dox + 5 mg/kg PTX). Three days after injection,
tumors were excised, fixed, frozen, cryo-sectioned, and mounted
onto glass slides. Frozen sections were fixed and rinsed with cold
PBS. After blocking and permeabilization, the slides were washed
by PBS and then incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture
(Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana) for 1 h. For P-gp expression, the
slides were stained after permeabilization with mouse monoclonal
anti-P-gp antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h, followed by
staining with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglob￾ulin G (IgG) antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and counter￾staining with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Fluorescence
images were acquired by a Yokogawa spinning-disk confocal
scanner system (Solamere Technology Group, Salt Lake City,
UT), using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope. Illumination powers
at 405, 491, 561, and 640 nm solid-state laser lines were provided
by an AOTF (acousto-optical tunable filter)-controlled laser-merge
system with 50 mW for each laser. All images were analyzed using
Nikon NIS-Elements software. To quantify TUNEL and P-gp￾positive cells, 4 regions of interest (ROI) were randomly chosen per
image at 62 magnification. Within one region, area of TUNEL,
or P-gp-positive nuclei, and area of nuclear staining were counted
by Nikon NIS-Element software. The data are expressed as %
total nuclear area stained by TUNEL or P-gp in the region.
Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of heart sections
Mice bearing 4T1 tumors were i.v. injected with 5 mg/kg Dox
+ 5 mg/kg PTX or cMLV(5 mg/kg Dox+5 mg/kg PTX). Three
days after injection, heart tissues were harvested and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde. The tissues were frozen, cut into sections, and
mounted onto glass slides. The frozen sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathologic specimens were examined
by light microscopy.
Statistics
Differences between two groups were determined with Student’s
t test. The differences among three or more groups were
determined with a one-way ANOVA.
Results
In vitro efficacy study by XTT assay
To achieve combination delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) and
paclitaxel (PTX), a previously developed crosslinked multilamellar
liposomal vesicle (cMLV) was used to incorporate PTX in the lipid
membrane and encapsulate Dox in the aqueous core at a 1:1 ratio
to form cMLV(Dox+PTX) [30]. We chose this combination ratio
because our previous study showed that it could induce synergy
combination effect both in vitro and in vivo [31]. It has been
reported that drug combinations can overcome drug resistance
that would otherwise limit the potential application of various
monotherapeutics [10]. To determine whether codelivery of Dox
and PTX could overcome drug resistance, an in vitro cytotoxicity
assay was performed at a wide range of concentrations of single
drug-loaded or dual drug-loaded cMLVs. As shown in Figure 1A
and 1B (left panel), both B16 cells and 4T1 cells developed drug
resistance to single drug-loaded cMLVs, but this resistance was
inhibited by applying the combined formulation, cMLV(Dox+
PTX). The maximal cytotoxicity of single drug-loaded cMLV
observed in these two tumor cells was between 60%–80%, while
cells treated with dual drug-loaded cMLV(Dox+PTX) showed
significantly more growth inhibition (,95%).
To further confirm the efficiency of dual drug-loaded cMLVs in
overcoming drug resistance, drug-resistant cell lines B16-R and
4T1-R were generated by continuously treating parental B16 or
4T1 with a high concentration of paclitaxel (5 mg/ml). Various
concentrations of single drug-loaded cMLV and dual drug-loaded
cMLV(Dox+PTX) were incubated with these two drug-resistant
cell lines for 48 h, and the cytotoxicity was measured by a standard
XTT assay. As shown in Figure 1D and 1E, both B16-R and 4T1-
R cells showed a high tolerance when treated with cMLV(PTX) or
cMLV(Dox), indicating that multidrug resistance had been
developed in these cells. In contrast, cMLV(Dox+PTX) triggered
significantly more cell death (90–100%) compared to that of single
drug-loaded cMLVs, confirming that a codelivery system could
overcome drug resistance induced by a high concentration of
single drug. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrat￾ed therapeutic efficacy of cMLV(Dox+PTX) in JC cells, a model
drug-resistant tumor cell line, corroborating the weaker potency of
single drug-loaded cMLVs compared to the dual drug-loaded
cMLVs. As shown in Figure 1C (left panel), the maximal
cytotoxicity of cMLV(Dox) and cMLV(PTX) was in the range of
60–70%, while peak cMLV(Dox+PTX) cytotoxicity was about
90% in JC cells.
IC50, which indicates drug concentration that causes 50%
inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, can provide information on
the efficacy of drugs. The IC50 values of the individual drugs and
combined drugs through cMLVs in B16, 4T1 and JC cells are
provided in Figure S1. However, it has also been reported that
slope m, a parameter mathematically analogous to the Hill
coefficient, may also have a significant effect on cytotoxicity
[33,34]. Therefore, a new model has been developed to evaluate
drug activity by incorporating three parameters (IC50, drug
concentration, and m) from the median effect model into a
single-value IIP (potential inhibition) with an intuitive meaning,
i.e., the log reduction in inhibitory effect [34]. Accordingly, to
increase the trustworthiness of our experiment, IIP was used to
evaluate the efficiency of dual drug-loaded cMLVs on cell
viability. As shown in Figure 1A to 1C (middle and right panels),
Dox and PTX in the dual drug-loaded cMLVs displayed a
significantly larger IIPCmax value in the cell lines studied compared
to that of the single drug-loaded cMLVs, indicating that

combinatorial cMLVs were more potent in cancer treatment than
single drug-loaded cMLVs.
Cellular uptake study of doxorubicin and paclitaxel
To investigate the mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity
observed with cMLV combination therapy, we evaluated the
effect of dual drug-loaded cMLVs on rates of drug influx/efflux in
cells. The intracellular accumulation of Dox and PTX was
examined by HPLC in 4T1 cells following exposure to Dox (1 mg/
ml) and PTX (1 mg/ml) in cMLVs, both individually and in
combination, and in JC cells with higher dose of Dox and PTX
(5 mg/ml). After 3 h incubation, the extracellular medium was
discarded, and intracellular drug (Dox or PTX) accumulation was
quantitatively determined by drug concentration in the cell lysates,
normalized by total cellular protein content of the cells. As seen in
Figure 2A and 2B, cMLV(Dox+PTX) significantly increased both
Dox and PTX accumulation in 4T1 cells compared to that of
single drug-loaded cMLVs (p , 0.05), suggesting that combination
treatments may overcome drug resistance. In addition, compared
to the administration of drug in solution, cMLV combination
treatment resulted in higher cellular accumulation of Dox and
PTX, an outcome most likely resulting from the internalization of
cMLVs by cells through endocytosis [30] and, consequently,
effectively bypassing the P-gp efflux pumps. The enhanced cellular
accumulation of drugs in dual drug-loaded cMLVs was also
observed in drug-resistant JC cells (Figure 2C and 2D) compared
to single drug-loaded cMLVs and drug combination in solution.
These data suggest that cMLV(Dox+PTX) significantly enhanced
the intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs through
mechanisms involving both combination treatment and nanopar￾ticle delivery.
Effect of codelivered nanoparticles on P-gp expression
Having shown that dual drug-loaded cMLVs enhance cellular
accumulation of drugs, we next sought to verify that this did,
indeed, result from the modulation of membrane pumps, which

are responsible for multidrug resistance. We first measured the
expression of P-gp by flow cytometry in 4T1 cells treated with
various nanoparticle formulations for 48 h to test if these cMLV
formulations were responsible for altering P-gp involvement in
multidrug resistance, along with decreased drug accumulation, in
cells [3,35]. As shown in Figure 3A, with the single drug-loaded
cMLV treatment, the expression of P-gp (in terms of integrated
mean fluorescence intensity) increased significantly in 4T1 cells (p
, 0.01), possibly leading, in turn, to the development of drug
resistance in 4T1 cells. However, dual drug-loaded cMLVs
significantly inhibited expression of P-gp when compared to that
of the single drug-loaded cMLVs and drug combination in
solution (p , 0.01), suggesting that the combinatorial delivery of
Dox and PTX via cMLVs could efficiently suppress P-gp
expression, thereby overcoming MDR. We next investigated
whether cMLV(Dox+PTX) could inhibit multidrug resistance in
JC cells, which exhibit drug-resistant phenotype by overexpression
of P-gp [32]. As shown in Figure 3B, the expression of P-gp
decreased after 48 h of incubation with JC cells (p , 0.05) when
treated with single drug-loaded cMLV, indicating that the
nanoparticle drug delivery system could, at least partially, suppress
MDR. However, the codelivery formulation of cMLV(Dox+PTX)
significantly inhibited P-gp expression compared to that of single
drug-loaded cMLVs and drug combination in solution (p , 0.01).

Codelivery of Chemotherapeutics via cMLVs to Overcome MDR in Tumor
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 October 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e110611

Taken together, these results indicated that the codelivery of Dox
and PTX via cMLVs could inhibit the expression of P-gp and
increase cellular accumulation of drugs, leading to enhanced drug
action in cells, including drug-resistant cells.
Efficacy of dual drug-loaded cMLVs against a murine
breast cancer model
It has been demonstrated that codelivery of Dox and PTX via
cMLVs is able to overcome drug resistance in vitro. However,
since the in vivo environment is considerably more complicated, it
remains unknown if this effect could be translated to an animal
cancer model. Therefore, in this experiment, a mouse breast
tumor model was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of dual
drug-loaded cMLVs compared with that of single-drug liposomal
formulations. At day 0, BALB/c mice were inoculated subcuta￾neously with 4T1 breast tumor cells. On day 8, mice bearing
tumors were randomly sorted into six groups, and each group was
treated with one of the following: PBS (control), cMLV(2 mg/kg
Dox), cMLV(2 mg/kg PTX), cMLV(2 mg/kg Dox)+
cMLV(2 mg/kg PTX), or cMLV(2 mg/kg Dox + 2 mg/kg
PTX) every three days. Tumor growth and body weights were
monitored until the end of the experiment (Figure 4A).
As shown in Figure 4B, mice in groups receiving cMLV(Dox),
cMLV (PTX) or cMLV(Dox)+cMLV(PTX) exhibited tumor
inhibition compared to those in the control group (p , 0.01).
Even more significantly, cMLV(Dox+PTX) treatment induced a
greater inhibition than that of cMLV encapsulating a single drug
and that of cMLV(Dox)+cMLV(PTX), indicating that codelivery
of Dox and PTX through single nanoparticle is essential for
overcoming drug resistance (p , 0.01). As one indication of
systemic toxicity, no weight loss was seen for the cMLV
formulation over the duration of the experiment (Figure 4C).
The in vivo efficacy of dual drug-loaded cMLVs against the 4T1
tumor model was further confirmed by a survival test. As shown in
Figure 4D, the groups treated with cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX), or
cMLV(Dox)+cMLV(PTX) had a prolonged lifespan compared to
the control group, while the mice in the group treated with
cMLV(Dox+PTX) had a significantly increased lifespan compared
to the groups treated with single drug-loaded cMLVs and the
group treated with cMLV(Dox) + cMLV(PTX) (p , 0.01).
Histology study
To study the antitumor mechanism in vivo, a TUNEL assay
was carried out to detect tumor cell apoptosis in tumors treated
with Dox (5 mg/kg) and/or PTX (5 mg/kg) in various formula￾tions for 3 days. As shown in Figure 5A and Figure 5C, 4T1
tumors treated with cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX), and Dox+PTX in
solution showed significantly more apoptotic cells compared with
controls (p , 0.01). The apoptosis index was also significantly
higher in the cMLV(Dox+PTX)-treated group as compared with
other groups (p , 0.05). Thus, the efficacy of cMLV(Dox+PTX) as
an antitumor treatment could be explained by data suggesting
increased tumor cell apoptosis. To further confirm the induction of
cell apoptosis in treated groups, the TUNEL assay was performed
in drug-resistant JC tumors treated with various formulations for 3
days. As shown in Figure 5B and 5D, cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX),
and Dox+PTX induced more apoptotic cells compared to control
JC tumors (p , 0.01). Dual drug-loaded cMLV-treated JC tumors
showed a remarkably higher apoptosis index compared with other
groups (p , 0.01), again confirming the enhanced antitumor
activity of cMLV(Dox+PTX).
To further investigate the innate characteristics of treated
tumors, both 4T1 and JC tumor sections from each treatment
group were analyzed for the expression of P-gp protein. As
shown in Figure 6A, P-gp expression level was moderate in the
control group. There appeared to be a significant enhancement
of P-gp expression in the cMLV(Dox) and cMLV(PTX) groups,
with an even more significant enhancement in Dox+PTX group
compared to controls. However, a marked decrease was
observed in the cMLV(Dox+PTX)-treated group when com￾pared to the cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX), and Dox+PTX groups,
as further confirmed by the quantification data in Figure 6C (p
, 0.01). Interestingly, P-gp was very high in the JC tumor
control group, as shown in Figure 6B. However, a significant
decrease appeared in the cMLV(Dox), cMLV(PTX), and Dox+
PTX groups, as further confirmed by the quantification data in
Figure 6D (p , 0.05). An even more significant decrease of P￾gp expression was seen in the cMLV(Dox+PTX) group (p ,
0.01), indicating that dual drug-loaded cMLVs might be able to
alter the innate characteristics of the multidrug-resistant tumor
cells such as JC cells. Taken together, these data show that
drug-loaded nanoparticles can partially bypass the P-gp efflux

pumps to increase cellular uptake of Dox and PTX, sufficiently
inducing cytotoxicity in cancer cells.
It has been reported that Dox treatment results in severe
irreversible cardiotoxicity, leading to myocyte apoptosis [36]. In
addition, cardiac toxicity, an unexpected clinical outcome of
combinatorial Dox and PTX treatment, has been reported [37].
Therefore, systemic toxicity of free Dox+PTX and cMLV(Dox+
PTX) was evaluated to determine whether codelived cMLVs could
decrease this side effect of combination drug treatment. To
accomplish this, a single intravenous dose of either Dox+PTX in
solution or cMLV(Dox+PTX) was administered to mice bearing
4T1 tumors. Next, hematoxylin and eosin-stained cardiac tissue
sections from each treatment group were examined (Figure S2).
Treatment with free Dox (5 mg/kg) and PTX (5 mg/kg) in
solution did cause cardiac toxicity, as indicated by myofibril loss,
disarray, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. However, when
cMLV(5 mg/kg Dox+5 mg/kg PTX) was administered under
the same experimental conditions via cMLVs, no visible loss of
myocardial tissue was observed.
Discussion
Chemotherapeutics are crucial to combating a variety of
cancers; however, clinical outcomes are always poor, as cancer
cells develop a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype after
several rounds of exposure to the chemotherapeutics. Many efforts
have been made to develop a therapeutic strategy to overcome
tumor MDR through the use of combined therapeutics to enhance
the efficiency of systemic drug delivered to the tumor site and
lower the apoptotic threshold. In this study, we have examined
augmentation of therapeutic efficacy upon co-administration of
Dox and PTX using a crosslinked multilamellar liposomal vesicle
(cMLV) in breast cancer cells and drug-resistant JC cells. We
demonstrated that combination therapy of Dox and PTX,
especially when codelivered in cMLV formulations, was effective
in enhancing the cytotoxicity in both wild-type and drug-resistant
cells by elevating the cellular accumulation and retention of the
drugs. We also showed that the dual therapeutic strategy efficiently
suppressed tumor growth by enhancing apoptotic response.
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane-bound active drug efflux
pump, is considered one of the most important mechanisms
involved in MDR [3,35]. As a result, growing interest has been

shown in the development of nanoparticle drug delivery systems to
overcome MDR. With their unique properties, nanoparticles are
able to passively target the tumor mass through the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect, enhancing the accumu￾lation of chemotherapeutics at target sites [23,24]. In addition,
nanoparticles can enter cells through the endocytosis pathway,
which is thought to be independent of the P-gp pathway, thus
increasing the cellular uptake and retention of therapeutics in
resistant cancer cells [26,27]. Previously, we demonstrated the
advantage of cMLVs in cancer therapy over conventional
liposomal formulations based on their sustained drug release,
enhanced vesicle stability and improved drug release, resulting in
improved therapeutic activity with reduced systemic toxicity [30].
Further investigation of this novel liposomal formulation showed
that it enable to translate the synergistic combination effect from in
vitro to in vivo antitumor efficiency [31]. Moreover, cMLVs are
internalized by tumor cells through caveolin-mediated endocytosis
[30], suggesting that cMLVs could be an efficient drug carrier to
overcome MDR. In this study, our in vitro and in vivo results
demonstrated that the co-administration of Dox and PTX at the
synergistic ratio (1:1) via cMLVs efficiently suppressed P-gp
expression in both wild-type and drug-resistant cancer cells.
In addition to nanodelivery, another potential strategy to
overcome MDR has resulted from combining multiple drugs. For
example, the combination of Dox and PTX in a cocktail is a
standard anthracycline-taxane treatment regimen and was found
to be efficacious in treating a variety of tumors by reducing the
individual drug concentration that would otherwise be required to
achieve cytotoxicity, thus overcoming drug resistance [13,14,15].
However, its clinical outcome was limited by the un-coordinated
biodistribution of combined drugs [16,17] and increase in cardiac
cytotoxicity [37]. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of Dox and
PTX was unified through the encapsulation of both drugs into a
single cMLV particle, resulting in dual drug-loaded cMLVs which
successfully reduced P-gp expression, increased the cellular
accumulation of drugs, and enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells,
including drug-resistant cells, as compared to single drug-loaded
cMLVs. Moreover, combination therapy of Dox and PTX

administered in cMLV formulations showed increased efficacy
over cMLV monotherapy in the suppression of tumor growth by
promoting apoptotic response in vivo.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a multimodal therapeutic
strategy to overcome tumor MDR by codelivery of Dox and PTX
via a crosslinked multilamellar liposomal vesicle. We demonstrat￾ed that such combinatorial delivery system increased therapeutic
efficacy by enhancing delivery efficiency to tumors and lowering
the apoptotic threshold of individual drugs, thus overcoming drug
resistance. The properties of cMLVs, such as improved stability
and sustained release of drugs, enable the nanoparticles to
sufficiently accumulate at tumor sites, subsequently entering tumor
cells via endocytosis to release therapeutics, thus potentially
bypassing the P-gp pathway to enhance cellular retention of
therapeutics. Moreover, cMLVs enable multidrug delivery to the
same action site, thereby lowering the tumor apoptotic threshold
of individual therapeutics and potentially inhibiting the MDR.
Taken together, this dual drug-loaded cMLV approach shows
promise for reducing MDR in cancer therapeutics.
