Abstract
Background: The objectives of this study are to identify causes of high-output stoma (HOS) and outlet obstruction
(OO), which are major complications of diverting ileostomy.
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 103 patients who underwent colorectal surgery and diverting
ileostomy between December 2015 and November 2018.
Results: HOS was found in 32 patients (31.1%) and OO in 19 (18.4%). Organ/space surgical site infection
(SSI), anastomotic leakage and OO were significant HOS-related factors in univariate analysis, and OO
(odds ratio [OR] 3.39, p = 0.034) was a independent HOS-related factor in multivariate analysis. Organ/space SSI
and male were significant OO-related factors in univariate analysis, and organ/space SSI (OR 3.77, p = 0.018)
was a independent OO-related factor in multivariate analysis. The white blood cell (WBC) count on
postoperative day (POD) 3 was significantly higher in the HOS group compared to the non-HOS group
(9765 vs. 8130 /mL, p < 0.05), and the WBC count (9400 vs. 7475 /mL, p < 0.05) and C-reactive protein level
(6.01 vs. 2.92 mg/L, p < 0.05) on POD 6 were significantly higher in the OO group compared to the
non-OO group.
Conclusion: Organ/space infection is involved in the common pathology of HOS and OO. Decreased intestinal
absorption due to intestinal edema caused by organ/space SSI and relative stenosis at the abdominal wall-penetrating
site are major causes of HOS and OO.

Background
Diverting ileostomy reduces the risk of anastomotic leak￾age (AL) after surgery for rectal cancer, and use of divert￾ing ileostomy has increased [1–3]. However,
complications of ileostomy-related high output stoma
(HOS) and outlet obstruction (OO) have incidences of
16–23% [4, 5] and 5.6–25.8% [6, 7], respectively. HOS
causes dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and renal dys￾function, resulting in a significant decrease of quality of
life (QOL). Most studies of HOS have described detection
or management, but few have examined the pathology of
HOS. Causes of HOS include diabetes, total proctocolect￾omy, intraabdominal abscess, paralytic ileus, AL and OO,
but no clear pathology has been shown [4, 8–12]. OO is
defined as intestinal obstruction in an abdominal wall￾penetrating site, but differs from general intestinal ob￾struction because symptoms are relieved by tube insertion
from the stoma. Causes of OO include total proctocolect￾omy and the thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle,

but as for HOS, the pathology remains to be eluci￾dated [13–15]. Furthermore, no study has examined
HOS and OO simultaneously and the relationship be￾tween HOS and OO is unknown. Therefore, this
study was performed as a retrospective examination
of patients with diverting ileostomy to determine the
pathology and relationship of HOS and OO, and to
identify related factors.
Methods
The subjects were 103 consecutive patients who under￾went colorectal surgery and diverting ileostomy between
December 2015 and November 2018. The study was per￾formed as a retrospective analysis. The indications for di￾verting ileostomy creation were intersphincteric resection
(ISR), preoperative therapy, or male patients with anasto￾mosis just above anal canal after total mesorectal excison.
Patients who underwent total proctocolectomy or emer￾gency surgery were often considered for diverting ileos￾tomy creation. The diverting ileostomy site was 40 cm
distant from the terminal ileum in the right lower abdo￾men to penetrate the abdominal wall in the direction to
allow lifting of the wall naturally. The aponeurosis of the
rectus abdominis muscle was longitudinally incised with a
two-finger width. A standardized technique was used to
create the loop ileostomy in the all patients.
Patient characteristics of age, sex, disease, body mass
index (BMI), diabetes, smoking history, preoperative
blood albumin (Alb), preoperative estimated glemerular
filtration rate (eGFR) and thickness of the rectus abdom￾inis muscle were examined. The thickness of the rectus
abdominis muscle was measured using a slice at the um￾bilical level on computed tomography (CT) recorded im￾mediately before surgery. A straight line was drawn
orthogonally to the horizontal axis at the maximal thick￾ness, and the thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle
was determined [14]. Surgical factors, such as operative
procedure, approach, lateral lymph node dissection
(LLND), operative time, blood loss volume, transfusion,
intraoperative fluid, anastomotic procedure were also ex￾amined. The preoperative conditions including

perforation, stenosis and preoperative chemotherapy
were also examined.
Postoperative complications were analyzed using the
Clavien-Dindo classification. In our institution, anas￾tomotic infectious complications are divided into AL
and organ/space surgical site infection (SSI). AL was
defined as clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal
pain and peritoneal irritation, and based on pus-like
or stool-like output draining from the pelvic floor,
anastomotic dehiscence found in a digital rectal
examination, extravasation of endoluminally adminis￾tered water-soluble contrast enema, and fluid or gas
retention surrounding the anastomotic site detected
by CT. Organ/space SSI was defined clinical symp￾toms of intraperitoneal infection without no evidence
of AL. It needs only antibiotic therapy for fever, ab￾dominal pain and peritoneal irritation without surgical
treatment.
HOS was defined as two-days continuous output of >
1500 mL per day [16]. OO was defined as symptoms of
intestinal obstruction, imaging of caliber changes in the
abdominal wall-penetrating site in ileostomy by CT, and
a condition that was improved by tube retention in the
oral stoma [15, 17]. These symptoms and signs were
used to confirm the diagnosis of OO. Associations of
clinical factors with HOS and OO were examined by
Fisher chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test. Factors
with a significant difference (p < 0.05) were then evalu￾ated by multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were
conducted using EZR [18].

muscle was 10.25 (5.46–19.14) mm. The underlying dis￾eases were malignant tumor in 84 (81.2%) patients, in￾flammatory bowel disease in 17 (16.5%), and perforation
of colon in 2 (1.9%).
Surgical procedures were low anterior resection in
52 (50.5%) patients, intersphincteric resection in 31
(30.1%), total proctcolectomy in 17 (16.5%), and high
anterior resection, sigmoidectomy and ileocecal resec￾tion in one subject each. Anastomotic procedures
were a double stapling technique in 57 (55.3%)
patients and hand-sewn anastomosis in 46 (44.7%).
Approaches for intraperitoneal cavity used laparos￾copy in 78 (75.7%) patients, a robot-assisted method
in 15 (14.6%), and laparotomy in 10 (9.7%). LLND
was performed in 28 (27.2%) patients and preopera￾tive chemotherapy in 34 (33%). The median operative
time was 319 (123–639) min, median blood loss vol￾ume was 60 (0–3550) mL, median intraoperative fluid
volume was 2800 (419–8800) mL, and intraoperative
transfusion was performed in 10 patients (9.7%). The
postoperative complications were AL in 18 (17.5%)
patients, organ/space SSI in 39 (37.9%), HOS in 32
(31.1%), and OO in 19 (18.4%). Grade IIIb and IV
complications were found in 9 patients (8.7%), of
whom 7 had AL (Table 1).
Analysis of HOS
The median onset time of HOS was postoperative day
(POD) 4 (range POD 2–15), the median output volume
was 2460 (1800–5450) mL, and the median maximum
output volume on the onset day was 3005 (1800–5450)
mL (Table 2). Organ/space SSI, AL, and OO were sig￾nificant HOS-related factors in univariate analysis, and
OO (odds ratio [OR] 3.39, p = 0.034) remained as a sig￾nificantly independent factor associated with HOS in
multivariate analysis (Table 3). The white blood cell
(WBC) count on POD 3 was significantly higher in the
HOS group than in the non-HOS group (9765 vs. 8130
/mL, p < 0.05) (Table 4). The WBC count on POD 6 and
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on PODs 3 and 6 were
also higher in the HOS group.
Analysis of OO
The median onset time of OO was POD 4 (range POD 1–
14), the median output volume was 1100 (25–3600) mL,
and the median maximum output volume on the onset
day was 2275 (80–4700) mL (Table 2). Organ/space SSI
and male were significant OO-related factors in univariate
analysis, but thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle did
not show this relationship. Organ/space SSI (OR 3.77, P =
0.018) was a significantly independent factor associated
with OO in multivariate analysis (Table 5). The WBC
count (9400 vs. 7475 /mL, p < 0.05) and CRP level (6.01
vs. 2.92 mg/L, p < 0.05) on POD 6 were significantly higher
in the OO group than in the non-OO group (Table 6).
The WBC count and CRP level on POD 3 were also
higher in the OO group. Out of 19 patients in the OO
group, 11 patients had HOS simultaneously. In HOS and
OO cases, 8 patients had organ/space SSI (72.7%).
Discussion
The criteria for the creation of diverting stoma vary
among institutions. A meta-analysis of the significance
of diverting stoma in rectal cancer showed that the anas￾tomosis close to the anus was protected by diverting
stoma [19]. A multicenter study in Japan showed that di￾verting stoma did not decrease the incidence of AL, but
reduced the severity [1], and three quarters of patients
with AL avoided reoperation, showing the usefulness of
diverting stoma. In addition, a multicenter study
confirmed that oncological safety is comparable in
sphincter-preserving surgery and abdominoperineal re￾section of locally advanced lower rectal cancer [20].
Therefore, the diverting stoma will continue to be cre￾ated in patients with rectal cancer.
Intraabdominal abscess, paralytic ileus, AL and OO
have previously been identified as risk factors for HOS
[4, 8–12]. Total proctocolectomy and a history of dia￾betes have also been suggested to be preoperative pre￾dictors of HOS [21], but these factors were not
identified as significant risk factors in this study. The re￾ported risk factors for OO are total proctocolectomy
and thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle at the
stoma-penetrating site [13–15]. However, these factors

also had no marked relationship with OO in this study.
Infection in organ/space site was associated with the
causes of HOS and OO. HOS and OO were associated
with the same factor which suggested similar pathology.
WBCs and CRP were examined on PODs 1, 3 and 6 as
markers that reflect infectious conditions. The HOS and
OO groups both had higher WBC counts and CRP levels
on PODs 3 and 6 compared to the non-HOS and non￾OO groups. The WBC count on POD 1 has previously
been suggested to be a predictor of HOS [22], but this
relationship was not significant in this study. The high
WBC counts and CRP levels on PODs 3 and 6 show a
prolonged postoperative infection in organ/space site,
and suggest that intestinal edema and a prolonged de￾crease in intestinal absorption, which may be caused by
infection in organ/space site, contribute to the pathology
of HOS and OO. Consequently, patients with organ/
space SSI should be managed with the probability of
HOS and OO kept in mind. The median onset time of
HOS and OO was POD 4, but some patients experi￾enced HOS and OO on POD 1 and 2. Therefore, HOS
and OO may be useful for an early sign suggesting infec￾tion in organ/space site.
In terms of output volume of OO, many patients had
output volume > 1000 mL on the day of clinical diagnosis
of OO. It may be because of prompt tube insertion in the
stoma for patients with symptoms such as abdominal dis￾tension. In this study, all subjects who developed OO were
fully improved by conservative treatment such as tube in￾sertion in the oral stoma. Therefore, the OO pathology is
relative stenosis of an abdominal wall-penetrating site of a
stoma due to intestinal edema caused by infection in
organ/space site. Thus, OO should be differentiated from
general structural intestinal obstruction. And it may better
to say relative outlet stenosis.
The limitation of this study is its performance at a
single-center study and lack of external validity. There is
an possibility that OO was a real structural obstruction
leading to HOS. However, the results of the study sug￾gest that infection in organ/space site is the major cause
of HOS and OO. Consequently, the most important
countermeasure for reducing HOS and OO is to
decrease the incidence of AL and infection in organ/
space site. Intraoperative assessment of tissue perfusion
during colorectal resection using indocyanine green
(ICG) [23], insertion of an anal drain to decrease pres￾sure in the anastomosed region [24], and stabilization of
procedures using robotic-assisted surgery [25–27] may
potentially improve outcomes. It is critical to treat
organ/space infection with consideration of the possibil￾ity of HOS and OO onset.
Conclusion
HOS and OO were found in 31 and 18% of subjects who
underwent colorectal surgery and diverting ileostomy, re￾spectively. Infection in the organ/space was associated with
the causes of HOS and OO. HOS and OO were associated
with the same factor which suggested similar pathology.
