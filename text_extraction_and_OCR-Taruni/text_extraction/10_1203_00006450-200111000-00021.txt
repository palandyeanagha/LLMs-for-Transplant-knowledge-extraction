Abstract
To determine the population-based frequency of a rare mutation
(the 121ins2 mutation in the surfactant protein B gene), we
developed high-throughput techniques to extract reliably and
rapidly amplifiable DNA from Guthrie cards. Using a 3-mm punch
from each of 10,044 Guthrie cards obtained from the Missouri
Department of Health, we extracted DNA with deionized water by
heating in the presence of 2% Chelex in a 96-well format. Average
yield of DNA from each punch was 52.6 ± 21 μg. Using 36mer
primers and a 10-μL reaction volume, we amplified a 354-bp


fragment of the surfactant protein B gene that contained the
mutation and identified the mutation by its susceptibility to
restriction enzyme digestion with Sfu I. The procedure required 5 h
per 96 samples but only 2 h of technician time. The amplification
rate on the first attempt was 99.2%. Based on detection of eight
individuals heterozygous for the mutation (confirmed by direct
sequencing), we estimate the allele frequency to be 0.8/1000
individuals, an estimate not significantly different from previous
estimates based on independent methods. High-throughput DNA
extraction and amplification will permit establishment of DNA
banks as well as efficient estimation of population-based genotype
frequency for both rare and common genetic disorders.
