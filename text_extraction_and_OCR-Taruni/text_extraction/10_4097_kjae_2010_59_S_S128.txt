We present two cases of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 2 patients who were undergoing 
living donor liver transplantation. On the preoperative transthoracic echocardiography, the first patient showed 
normal ventricular function and a normal wall thickness, but severe hemodynamic deterioration developed 
during the anhepatic period and this was further aggravated after reperfusion in spite of volume resuscitation and 
catecholamine therapy. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed the systolic anterior motion 
of the mitral valve leaflet together with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The second patient showed left 
ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction on the preoperative echocardiography. 
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was used to guide fluid administration and the hemodynamic 
management throughout the procedure and a temporary portocaval shunt was established to mitigate the venous 
pooling during the anhepatic period. The purpose of this report is to emphasize the clinical significance of dynamic 
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in patients who are undergoing living donor liver transplantation and the 
role of intraoperative echocardiography to detect and manage it. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2010; 59: S128-S132)

 Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
(LVOTO) occurs in patients with [1] or without hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy [2-5]. We present here two cases of dynamic 
LVOTO in patients who were undergoing living donor liver 
transplantation (LDLT). Anesthesiologists are frequently 
challenged during liver transplantation (LT) due to a large 
volume shift secondary to the surgical and medical bleeding 
and caval clamping, the low systemic vascular resistance and 
postreperfusion syndrome [6]. Additionally, the coexisting cardiac 
dysfunction and a small graft volume-to size due to LDLT required 
more delicate fluid management in our cases. Intraoperative 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be highly useful 
tool to monitor the intracavitary volume status and contractility 
for patients with dynamic LVOTO during a LDLT procedure.

Case Reports
Case 1
 A 49-year-old man (body weight: 86 kg, height: 169 cm) 
who was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma with 
liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (Child-Pugh grade C, 
MELD score 14) presented for LDLT. His past medical history 
revealed diabetes mellitus that was well controlled with an 
oral hypoglycemic agent. The abnormal results of preoperative 
laboratory testing were as follows: aspartate transminase (AST): 
59 U/L, total bilirubin: 3.1 mg/dl, albumin: 2.4 g/dl, platelets: 
91,000/ml. The ECG and chest X-ray were within normal limits. 
Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed 
diastolic dysfunction grade 2 with left atrial enlargement. No 
left ventricular hypertrophy and LVOTO were identified (Fig. 1). 
 Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg and 
vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and it was maintained with desflurane 
in air and oxygen. The routine vascular access consisted of a 9 
Fr introducer (Advanced Venous AccessⓇ) on the right internal 
jugular vein, a pulmonary artery catheter and two arterial 
catheters on the radial artery and femoral artery respectively, 
and a femoral venous catheter. After anesthetic induction, 
the vital signs were stable and the intraoperative course was 
unremarkable during the preanhepatic phase (Table 1).
 The anhepatic phase began 3 hours 30 minutes after 
anesthetic induction, and hemodynamic instability abruptly 
developed. The hemodynamic instability improved with a large 
volume of fluids and blood products (crystalloid solution 10,500 
ml, colloid solution 1,200 ml, Cell Saver autotransfusion 978 ml 
and leukocyte-depleted red blood cells (LDRBCs) 2 units for 
2 hours) and catecholamine infusion (dopamine 5 μg/kg/min 
and norepinephrine 0.1 μg/kg/min) (Table 1).
 Reperfusion began 2 hours 20 minutes after portal 
vein clamping, and the hemodynamic instability further 
deteriorated. We administered a large volume of fluids and 
blood products (crystalloid solution 3,400 ml, Cell Saver 
autotransfusion 500 ml and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 2 
units in 1 hour) and increased the doses of catecholamines 
(norepinephrine 0.3 μg/kg/min) (Table 1). Two hours and 
30 minutes after reperfusion, the endtidal CO2 was suddenly 
decreased and the ST segment of the ECG was elevated; the 
hemodynamic instability did not improve despite intravascular 
volume replacement and increased doses of catecholamines 
(dopamine 10 μg/kg/min, norepinephrine 0.1 μg/kg/min and 
epinephrine 0.1 μg/kg/min) (Table 1). As there was preoperative 
diastolic dysfunction, we inserted a TEE to accurately evaluate 
the cardiac function at 3 hours and 30 minutes after reperfusion. 
The TEE evaluation revealed signs of dynamic LVOTO, 
including systolic anterior motion (SAM) and eccentric mild￾to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Based on the TEE findings, 
the epinephrine infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min) was immediately 
discontinued, esmolol infusion (30 μg/kg/min) was initiated 
Fig. 1. The preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed 
no left ventricular hypertrophy, a normal flow pattern in the left 
ventricular outflow tract (*) and no systolic anterior motion of the 
mitral leaflet in case 1. The heart rate was 75-80 beats/min.

and several 100 μg boluses of phenyleprine and aggressive 
volume resuscitation were performed (crystalloid solution 1,400 
ml, colloid solution 500 ml, Cell Saver autotransfusion 1,071 
ml, FFP 2 units for 1 hour). Afterward, the vital signs gradually 
became stable and the operation ended uneventfully (Table 1). 
The total infused volume included crystalloid solution: 26,400 
ml, colloid solution: 2,650 ml, Cell Saver autotransfusion: 4,071 
ml, LDRBCs: 5 units, FFP: 8 units and cryoprecipitate: 9 units. 
Postoperatively, large volumes of fluids and blood products 
were necessary to stably maintain the hemodynamics and 
the decreasing the dose of vasopressors was not possible. On 
second postoperative day, the TTE revealed the SAM with 
dynamic LVOTO (Fig. 2A). The color doppler showed mild 
mitral regurgitation (Fig. 2B) and flow acceleration in the LVOT 
(Fig. 2C). The patient underwent reoperation for control of the 
surgical bleeding on postoperative day 3. He was discharged on 
postoperative day 42.
Case 2
 A 45-year-old man (body weight: 84 kg, height: 180 cm) was 
diagnosed with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (Child￾Pugh grade C, MELD score 40) and he presented for LDLT. 
He had oliguric acute renal failure caused by hepatorenal 
syndrome, and this required continuous renal replacement 
therapy. The abnormal results of the preoperative laboratory 
testing were as follows: AST: 56 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 35 U/L, 
GGT (Gamma(γ)-Glutamyl Transferase): 20 U/L, total bilirubin: 
12.5 mg/dl, albumin: 2.6 g/dl, BUN (blood urea nitrogen): 31.7 
mg/dl, creatinine: 3.75 mg/dl, platelets: 35,000/ml and the 
prothrombin time (INR): 2.71 sodium 129 mEq/L. The other 
laboratory testing and ECG were within the normal limits. 
However, the chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema on the 
bilateral lung fields. The preoperative TTE revealed asymmetric 
septal hypertrophy (the thickness of the interventricular 
septum and left ventricular posterior wall was 29 mm and 9 
mm, respectively) with LVOTO. The mean pressure gradient of 
the LVOT was 80 mmHg. The color doppler showed eccentric 
moderate mitral regurgitation due to SAM. There was also grade 
2 diastolic dysfunction. He experienced occasional hypotension 
(mean arterial pressure: 40 mmHg) accompanied by drowsy 
mentality, dizziness, blurred vision and chest discomfort caused 
by aggravation of the LVOTO due to volume depletion.
 Anesthesia was induced with etomidate 0.2 mg/kg and 
atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and it was maintained with desflurane in 
air and oxygen. A 9 Fr introducer (Advanced Venous AccessⓇ) 
was placed on the right internal jugular vein, and a pulmonary 
artery catheter and two arterial catheters were placed on the 
radial artery and femoral artery, respectively, and a femoral 
venous catheter were placed for routine vascular access. The 
TEE probe was gently inserted and there was no variceal 
bleeding. There were no noticeable changes of the LVOTO 
and SAM compared to the preoperative findings. The vital 
signs were stable during induction, but the blood pressure 
began to decrease 20 minutes later. The favorable response 
to phenylephrine 100 μg bolus was confirmed, and then 
continuous infusion of norephinephrine was started at 0.05 μg/
kg/min and this was adjusted in the range of 0.05-0.2 μg/kg/
min along with maintaining the intravascular volume.
 After bolus phenylephrine 100 μg and increasing the 
norephnephrine dose to 0.25 μg/kg/min, the anhepatic 
phase began and a portocaval shunt was created to mitigate 
the venous pooling. The patient’s intermittent hypotension 
was treated with intravascular volume expansion and bolus 
phenylephrine, and the norephinephrine dose was increased 
to 0.3 μg/kg/min. The infused fluid and blood products were 
crystalloid solution 1,900 ml, half saline 5,600 ml, colloid 
solution 2,450 ml, Cell Saver autotransfusion 1,355 ml, LDRBCs 
2 units, FFP 2 units and cryoprecipitate 6 units until 1 hour after 
the anhepatic phase. 
 Reperfusion began after a 100 μg bolus of phenylephrine. 
Milder reperfusion syndrome occurred and the patient

spontaneously recovered. There were no noticeable changes 
of the LVOTO and SAM compared to the initial findings after 
induction. The rest of the operation was relatively uneventful 
with maintaining the intravascular volumeand continuous 
infusion of norepinephrine at 0.4-0.6 μg/kg/min. The total 
administered volume included crystalloid solution 7,700 ml, 
half saline 7,300 ml, colloid solution 2,970 ml, 5% dextrose 
water 200 ml, Cell Saver autotransfusion 3,701 ml, LDRBCs 5 
units, FFP 6 units, leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates 
6 units and cryoprecipitate 6 units for 11 hours 30 minutes. 
On postoperative day 1, the TTE revealed moderate mitral 
regurgitation and dynamic LVOTO with SAM. An emergency 
operation was performed on postoperative day 2 due to 
persistent bleeding. The patient’s postoperative course was 
complicated by septic shock due to the cellulitis of both thighs. 
Doppler ultrasonography showed sluggish flow of the hepatic 
vein, portal vein and hepatic artery. Eventually, the patient 
expired on postoperative day 69. 
Discussion
 Dynamic LVOTO in a structurally normal heart has been 
described in the medical literature [3-5], Aniskevich et al. 
[7] reported that a dynamic LVOTO with SAM developed 
intraoperatively in a patient with a normal stress echocardiogram 
preoperatively and who underwent LT. In addition, although 
performing preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography 
for cardiac evaluation seems to be valuable to predict adverse 
cardiovascular events after LT [8,9], the incidence and prognosis 
of dynamic LVOTO during LT are still unknown. Further, the 
preoperative degree of the peak pressure gradient in a patient 
with LVOT does not necessarily predict the outcome and the 
presence of dynamic LVOTO is not a contraindication for LT [10]. 
 Patients with end stage liver disease usually demonstrate 
a hyperdynamic state. In addition, LT is associated with 
further decreases in the left ventricular preload secondary to 
intraoperative bleeding or surgical interruption of the inferior 
vena cava (the preanhepatic and anhepatic period) and the 
decrease of systemic vascular resistance after recirculation of 
the donor liver (the postreperfusion period) [11]. Therefore, 
the patients undergoing LT often have several risk factors for 
dynamic LVOTO and this may be precipitated by hypovolemia 
in combination with a hyperdynamic state that is induced by 
catecholamine administration. In case 1, hemodynamic insta￾bility developed immediately after the start of the anhepatic 
period and the dynamic LVOTO might have been triggered by 
hypovolemia, as evidenced by the low CVP and RVEDV, which 
are the parameters of the intravascular volume status (Table 1). 
 The anesthetic management of hypovloemia is aggressive 
volume therapy, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume 
can be improved with aggressive intravascular volume loading 
to increase the preload. Yet the diastolic dysfunction in case 
1 deterred us from performing aggressive volume therapy for 
fear of congestive heart failure until the exact volume status 
of the heart was confirmed by TEE. Moreover, in the case of a 
small graft volume-to size when performing LDLT, excessive 
volume during reperfusion could also damage the sinusoids 
in the grafted liver. These reasons make the fluid management 
more delicate and it had to be done in a sophisticated 
manner. For case 1, the cardiac evaluation with TEE guided 
us to change the therapeutic directions by discontinuing the 
epinephrine infusion and then start fluid loading. We next used 
phenylephrine to increase the systemic vascular resistance 
and esmolol (an ultrashort acting beta-blocker) to improve the 
degree of obstruction by decreasing both the chronotropic and 
inotroic state of the left ventricle and inhibiting the profound 
beta-adrenergic mediated splanchnic vasodilation that is 
common in patients with end stage liver disease. For case 
2, since we noticed the LVOTO before operation, we chose 
norepinephrine instead of other inotropics and we created 
portocaval shunt at the early stage of the anhepatic period 
to minimize the mesenteric venous pooling. As a result, the 
hemodynamic stability was maintained throughout the surgery.
 The TEE played an important role in diagnosing and mana￾ging the dynamic LVOTO in our cases. The choice of drug and 
the amount of fluid challenge were guided by the findings 
of TEE. During the reperfusion period, which is the most 
critical period of LT, the cardiac output measured by the 
thermodilution technique can be inaccurate due to thermal 
gradients in the venous flow from the cold liver and also due to 
the rapid changes in cardiac function with time constants that 
are shorter than that for calculating the cardiac output [12]. In 
contrast, TEE provides continuous monitoring of the cardiac 
function and it facilitates appropriate management. 
 The presence of esophageal varices was previously thought to 
be a contraindication for TEE, but several studies demonstrated 
the safe use of TEE in these patients [13,14]. Based on these 
studies, TEE appears to be safe in patients with varices and 
its use must be strongly considered in patient with cardiac 
problems. 
 In conclusion, dynamic LVOTO should be ruled out in 
patients with refractory hemodynamic instability during LT 
although no evidence of LVOTO is found on the screening 
echocardiography. Moreover, intraoperative TEE is highly useful 
for confirming dynamic LVOTO and to provide the surgeon 
with therapeutic guidance.
