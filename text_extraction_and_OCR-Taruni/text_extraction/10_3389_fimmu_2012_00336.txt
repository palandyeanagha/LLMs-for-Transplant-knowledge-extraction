Interactions between killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA-A, -B, and -C
ligands diversify the functions of human natural killer cells. Consequently, combinations
of KIR and HLA genotypes affect resistance to infection and autoimmunity, success of
reproduction and outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation. HLA-C, with its C1 and
C2 epitopes, evolved in hominids to be specialized KIR ligands. The system’s foundation
was the C1 epitope, with C2 a later addition, by several million years. The human inhibitory
receptor for C1 is encoded by KIR2DL2/3, a gene having two divergent allelic lineages:
KIR2DL2 is a B KIR haplotype component and KIR2DL3 an A KIR haplotype component.
Although KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 exhibit quantitative differences in specificity and avidity
for HLA-C, they qualitatively differ in their genetics, functional effect, and clinical influence.
This is due to linkage disequilibrium between KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2, a closely related
activating receptor that was selected for lost recognition of HLA-C.

Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to immune defense against
infection (Biron et al., 1999; Orange, 2002), and also to forming
the placenta during reproduction (Hiby et al., 2004). In order to
kill infected cells selectively, NK cells must distinguish healthy
cells from diseased cells and cause them no harm (Ljunggren and
Karre, 1990). A mechanism for achieving this, involves inhibitory
NK cell receptors that engage MHC class I molecules. By their
level of expression and diverse repertoire of bound peptides, MHC
class I molecules provide NK cell receptors with a sensitive read￾out of cellular health. Humans have two complementary types
of inhibitory receptor that recognize human MHC (HLA) class I
molecules. Recognition of HLA-E by CD94:NKG2A involves both
a highly conserved ligand and a highly conserved receptor, and is
thus a constant feature of human immune systems (Borrego et al.,
1998; Braud et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1998). At the opposite end of
the spectrum are the extraordinarily diverse interactions between
polymorphic HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules and the family of
variable killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), interactions
that diversify and individualize human immune systems (Valiante
et al., 1997; Vilches and Parham, 2002). Although different KIR
recognize HLA-A, -B, and -C, it is the interactions between KIR
and HLA-C that dominate in preventing NK cells from attacking
healthy autologous cells (Colonna et al., 1993;Valiante et al., 1997).
KIR STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND SPECIFICITY
FOR HLA CLASS I
In the context of KIR recognition of HLA-C, two mutually exclu￾sive groups of HLA-C allotypes are defined and correlated with the
sequence dimorphism at position 80 in the α1 domain (Colonna
et al., 1993; Moretta et al., 1993). Roughly half of the>1000 known
HLA-C allotypes have the asparagine at position 80 that forms
the C1 epitope. The remaining HLA-C allotypes have the lysine
at position 80 that forms the C2 epitope. Recognition of C1 is
mediated by the inhibitory receptors, KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3,
both of which have lysine at position 44. Genomic characteri￾zation and population studies of the KIR gene family show that
the genes encoding KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 segregate as alleles of
a single genetic locus, which is often referred to as KIR2DL2/3
(Uhrberg et al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2010, 2011). The inhibitory
receptor that principally recognizes the C2 epitope of HLA-C is
KIR2DL1, with some additional contribution from KIR2DL2, and
possibly also KIR2DL3. In addition to the inhibitory receptors,
KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3 have short-tailed, activating counter￾parts, KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS2, respectively, whose extracellular
Ig-like domains are highly homologous to those of their inhibitory
partners.
Phylogenetic and structural analyses show how the KIR of
humans and great apes (the hominid species) group into four
discrete lineages: I, II, III, and V. All KIR that recognize HLA￾C, and its orthologs in other hominid species, are of the lineage
III KIR. In humans, lineage III KIR are characterized by having
two extracellular Ig-like domains, D1 and D2, encoded by exons
4 and 5, respectively. Exons 1 and 2 encode the leader peptide,
whereas exon 3, which encodes an Ig-like domain, is not incor￾porated into mRNA and is called pseudoexon 3 (Vilches et al.,
2000). The presence of the pseudoexon 3 argues that the lineage

Moesta and Parham KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 specificities
III KIR with two Ig-like domains likely evolved from lineage III
KIR with three Ig-like domains (D0, D1, and D2). Consistent with
this thesis, some of the chimpanzee lineage III KIR that recognize
Patr-C, the chimpanzee ortholog of HLA-C, have a pseudoexon
3, whereas the others have a functional exon 3 that specifies the
D0 domains of these three Ig-like domains (Khakoo et al., 2000;
Moesta et al., 2009).
Interaction of KIR with HLA class I is sensitive to single
amino acid substitutions in the KIR, which can change its epi￾tope specificity (Winter and Long, 1997) or eliminate recognition
of HLA-C (Biassoni et al., 1997; Winter and Long, 1997; Win￾ter et al., 1998). Winter and Long (1997) demonstrated that in
the context of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3, mutagenesis at position
44 was sufficient to “swap” the C1 and C2 specificities. Thus the
KIR2DL1 mutant with lysine-44 acquired C1 specificity, whereas
the KIR2DL3 mutant with methionine 44 acquired C2 specificity.
On this basis, position 44 has been described as the specificity￾determining position of the lineage III KIR (Vilches and Parham,
2002). In contrast, at the adjacent position, replacement of pheny￾lalanine 45 in KIR2DL2 with tyrosine abrogates all interaction
with HLA-C. Tyrosine 45 occurs naturally in KIR2DS2, the acti￾vating counterpart of KIR2DL2/3. The sequences of the D1 and
D2 domains of KIR2DS2 are very similar to those of KIR2DL2/3,
particularly KIR2DL2. Despite the overall similarity, the pres￾ence of tyrosine 45 prevents KIR2DS2 from recognizing HLA-C;
substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 45 is suffi￾cient for KIR2DS2 to recognize the C1 epitope (Saulquin et al.,
2003). Similar swap mutagenesis between inhibitory KIR2DL1
and activating KIR2DS1 demonstrated that lysine-70, naturally
present in KIR2DS1, reduced affinity for HLA-Cw4 to about half
that achieved with threonine-70, naturally present in KIR2DL1
(Biassoni et al., 1997; Moesta et al., 2010; Hilton et al., 2012).
In contrast to KIR2DS2, interaction of KIR2DS1 with C2 has
been well established using both cell-based assays of immunolog￾ical function and direct biochemical measurements of binding
(see Table 1). Both types of assay show that the potency of
KIR2DS1 binding to C1 is significantly reduced compared to that
of KIR2DL1. Functional interactions between KIR2DS1 and C2
can also be inferred from the protection that maternal KIR2DS1
affords against pregnancy disorders, such as preeclampsia and
recurrent miscarriage (Hiby et al., 2010), as well as the impact
of KIR2DS1 on NK cell education (Fauriat et al., 2010). Although
KIR2DS2 can deliver activating signals to NK cells, the function
of this enigmatic receptor remains unresolved, because a variety
of experimental approaches have detected either very weak inter￾action with HLA class I or no interaction at all (see Table 1).
For example, Moesta et al. (2010) observed a low but signifi￾cant binding to C1+ HLA-C*16:01 but not to six other C1+
HLA-C allotypes or any HLA-A or -B allotypes. Stewart et al.
(2005) demonstrated a very low binding of KIR2DS2 tetramers
to EBV-infected B cells derived from donors bearing C1, but not
to primary B cells or EBV-infected B cells from C2 homozygous
donors, leaving open the possibility that KIR2DS2 functions under
inflammatory conditions.
The crystal structures of several KIR alone and of two com￾plexes of KIR bound to HLA-C (Table 2), provide insight to the
molecular interactions that govern KIR interactions with HLA
class I and determine the C1 and C2 specificities (Boyington
et al., 2000; Fan et al., 2001). Whereas lysine-44 of KIR2DL2
forms a direct hydrogen bond with C1-determining asparagine-80
of HLA-C*03 (Boyington et al., 2000), the KIR2DL1/HLA-C*04
structure revealed no direct interaction between methionine
44 of KIR2DL1 and lysine-80 of HLA-C*04 (Fan et al., 2001).
Instead, rather than interacting directly with HLA-C, methionine￾44 contributes spatially to a charged pocket of KIR2DL1 that
accommodates the lysine-80 of HLA-C*04. Biochemically, the
KIR–MHC interactions are characterized by fast association and
dissociation rates, with an overall affinity in the low micromolar
range (Maenaka et al., 1999a). The majority of the direct inter￾actions between KIR2DL and HLA-C are achieved by shape and
charge complementarity between the two contacting surfaces. The
importance of charge complementarity, can explain how single

amino acid substitutions can have such profound effects as alter￾ing the specificity of the interaction or reducing its avidity to a
non-detectable level.
Binding and functional studies show that KIR2DL2 is a stronger
inhibitory receptor than KIR2DL3 (Winter et al., 1998; Moesta
et al., 2008), even though the four extracellular substitutions (at
positions 16, 35, 148, and 200) that distinguish the two receptors
are located away from the binding site. The paired polymorphisms
at residues 16 and 148 act synergistically, in a way that might
control the flexibility and/or the angle of the hinge between the
D1 and D2 domains (Moesta et al., 2008). The observed hinge
angle in KIR crystal structures is unusually acute compared to
other hematopoietic Ig-superfamily receptors (Fan et al., 1997). It
is also found to vary in the structures of KIR alone, compared to
the structures of KIR bound to HLA-C (Fan et al., 2001; Boyington
et al., 2001). Flexibility of the hinge may, therefore, be critical for
enhancing the interaction of KIR2DL2 with HLA-C.
Taken together, these studies suggest that instead of a binary
“on–off” switch, KIR-mediated NK cell control involves a con￾tinuum along which the strengths of the inhibitory KIR/HLA-C
interactions vary (Winter et al., 1998; Moesta et al., 2008). Among
these, KIR2DL1 interaction with C2 is considered the strongest
inhibitory combination, with KIR2DL2/C1 conferring interme￾diate inhibition, and KIR2DL3/C1 having the weakest inhibitory
effect. These differences in the observed inhibitory capacities of
HLA-C reactive KIR are hypothesized to explain clinical associa￾tions with the progress of viral infection outcome and reproductive
success. In modulating the resolution of acute Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection, the weaker inhibition conferred by KIR2DL3/C1
was found to be protective, possibly because it facilitates stronger
NK cell responses than KIR2DL2/C1 or KIR2DL1/C2 (Khakoo
et al., 2004). By contrast, in pregnancy the stronger inhibitory
interaction of maternal KIR2DL1 with fetal C2 appears to render
uterine NK cells hypofunctional, thereby predisposing pregnan￾cies with this genetic combination to several types of disorders:
recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction
(Hiby et al., 2004, 2010).
KIR2DL1 appears exquisitely specific for C2, exhibiting no
detectable cross-reactivity with C1 (Moesta et al., 2008). Con￾versely, KIR2DL2, and to lesser extent KIR2DL3, cross-reacts with
C2 and may use it as a functional ligand (see Table 3). C2 binds
soluble KIR2DL2 in cell-free assays (Winter et al., 1998; Moesta
et al., 2008), and can inhibit KIR2DL2 expressing NK cell lines
(Winter et al., 1998; Moesta et al., 2008; Schonberg et al., 2011) as
well as KIR2DL2+ NK cells (Pende et al., 2009; Schonberg et al.,
2011). This interaction, of C2 with KIR2DL2 is weaker than that
between C2 and KIR2DL1, but significantly stronger than that of
KIR2DL3 with C2. Pointing to the physiological importance of
the C2–KIR2DL2 interaction, analysis of KIR repertoire forma￾tion demonstrates that C2 can function as a ligand for KIR2DL2
in vivo. Notably the presence of KIR2DL2 reduces the frequency
of NK cells expressing KIR2DL1, regardless of HLA-C genotype
(Schonberg et al., 2011). This effect on receptor acquisition was
not apparent for KIR2DL3, suggesting its C2 reactivity is too
weak in vivo. Because, genetically, KIR2DS2 is in almost com￾plete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with KIR2DL2, but is not linked
to KIR2DL3, the functional effects attributed to KIR2DL2 could
also have contributions from KIR2DS2.
In addition to the subset of C1+ HLA-C allotypes, the HLA-B
allotypes, HLA-B*46 and B*73, carry C1 and function as ligands
for KIR2DL2/3 in cell-killing and direct binding assays (Barber
et al., 1996; Moesta et al., 2008). Whereas all HLA-B allotypes
have asparagine 80, HLA-B*46 and HLA-B*73 are the only HLA￾B allotypes to combine asparagine-80 with valine 76 (Robinson
et al., 2011), the latter being fixed at HLA-C and shown to be
important in forming the C1 and C2 epitopes (Mandelboim
et al., 1997). That neither HLA-B*46 nor HLA-B*73 is widely
distributed, the former being localized to South East Asia (Abi￾Rached et al., 2010) and the latter to western Asia (Abi-Rached
et al., 2011) suggests these variants emerged in the human popu￾lation relatively recently and underwent localized selective sweeps.
One possibility is that the advantage conferred by these allotypes
was their function as C1-bearing ligands for KIR2DL2/3. Whereas
human C1+ HLA-B allotypes are rare, C1+ allotypes of Patr-B, the
chimpanzee ortholog of HLA-B, are common (Abi-Rached et al.,
2010). This contrast suggests there was much loss of C1+ HLA-B
allotypes during human evolution, caused either by selection or
genetic drift. The emergence of HLA-B*46 and HLA-B*73 can be
seen as a start to reversing this long-term trend (Abi-Rached et al.,
2010, 2011).
GENETICS AND POLYMORPHISM OF KIR2DL2/3
AND KIR2DS2
KIR are encoded by a compact cluster of genes that forms part of
the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) on chromosome 19q13.4
(Wilson et al., 2000; Trowsdale, 2001). An important component
of KIR variation is that the KIR haplotypes vary in gene content
(Uhrberg et al., 1997; Wilson et al., 2000). Conserved genes are
present at the centromeric (KIR3DL3) and telomeric (KIR3DL2)
ends of the haplotype, as well as in the central part (KIR3DP1
and KIR2DL4) of the locus (Pyo et al., 2010). These framework
genes define two regions of gene-content variation, one in the
centromeric part of the locus, the other in the telomeric part.
Found in both parts of the locus are two types of alternative gene￾content motifs that are qualitatively different and called Cen-A,
Cen-B, Tel-A and Tel-B (Figure 1). The combination of Cen-A
and Tel-A forms the group A KIR haplotype, a relatively short

haplotype with a predominance of inhibitory receptors that recog￾nize HLA class I. The three other combinations Cen-B with Tel-B,
Cen-B with Tel-A, and Cen-A with Tel-B are collectively called
the group B KIR haplotypes. Characterizing the Cen-B and Tel-B
motifs are activating KIR and KIR that have reduced or lost recog￾nition of HLA class I. Gene-content variation of KIR haplotypes
has evolved through asymmetric recombination, which is facili￾tated by the short intergenic regions with high sequence similarity.
Complementing this mechanism is homologous recombination at
the center of the locus, which assorts the different Cen and Tel
motifs (Wilson et al., 2000; Pyo et al., 2010).
KIR2DL2/3 is a gene of the centromeric region: KIR2DL3 being
a characteristic gene of Cen-A, while KIR2DL2 is a characteristic
gene of Cen-B. A further difference is that the KIR2DS2 gene is
adjacent to the KIR2DL2 gene and is also a characteristic gene of
Cen-B. Indeed, KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 are in almost complete LD
with each other and KIR2DS2 has never been found adjacent to
KIR2DL3. From a functional point of view it is important to appre￾ciate that the combination of KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2 is allelic to
KIR2DL3, a property that complicates the interpretation of the
many disease associations that correlate with the Cen-A/Cen-B
difference.
Gene-content diversity of KIR haplotypes is one dimension to
KIR diversity, another is allotypic polymorphism, a feature of all
the HLA-C reactive KIR (Table 4). For KIR2DL2/3 the principal
allotypic division is between KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3, which dif￾fer at four positions in the Ig-like domains and at 10 positions
in the stem, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Substitu￾tions in the Ig-like domains are responsible for giving KIR2DL2
higher avidity for C1 than KIR2DL3, and also for giving KIR2DL2
higher cross-reactivity with particular C2+HLA-C (notably HLA￾C*02 and HLA-C*05; Moesta et al., 2008). The sequences of the
stem, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of KIR2DL2 and
KIR2DL1 are very similar indicating that KIR2DL2 was the prod￾uct of recombination between ancestral forms of KIR2DL3 and
KIR2DL1. In in vitro assays of cellular cytotoxicity the different
stem, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of KIR2DL2 and
KIR2DL3 had no functional effect. However, the similarity of

KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL1 in these regions of signal transduction
might contribute to the striking observation that the presence of
the KIR2DL2 gene is associated with reduction in the frequency of
NK cells expressing KIR2DL1 (Schonberg et al., 2011).
Whereas KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 are divergent allotypic lin￾eages, the polymorphism within each of these lineages is more
restricted, with allotypes usually differing by one or a small cluster
of substitutions. Although systematic investigation of these allo￾typic differences has not been performed, the study of individual
allotypes illustrates a range of functional influences (Table 5). In
the Yucpa population of South Amerindians co-evolution between
C1+ HLA-C and KIR2DL3 is associated with a reduction in the fre￾quency of the “old” KIR2DL3*001 allotype and its replacement by
two “new” allotypes, KIR2DL3*008N and KIR2DL3*009 that dif￾fer at single nucleotide positions from KIR2DL3*001 and appear
unique to the Yucpa. That KIR2DL3*008N does not make a func￾tional protein and KIR2DL3*009 has lower avidity for C1 than
KIR2DL3*001, shows that the selection changing these allotype
frequencies was for reduced interaction between KIR2DL3 and
C1+HLA-C (Gendzekhadze et al., 2009).
KIR2DL2*004 differs from other KIR2DL2 allotypes by a
cluster of three substitutions in the D1 domain. Of these, the
substitution of threonine for arginine at position 41 disrupts the
folding of the protein, with the result that it is retained inside the
cell and does not get transported to the plasma membrane (Van￾denBussche et al., 2006). An example of how allelic polymorphism
can directly influence signaling function is provided by KIR2DL1,
a gene that can be present on both Cen-A and Cen-B. Each of the
25 KIR2DL1 allotypes has either cysteine or arginine at position
245 toward the end of the transmembrane domain and the begin￾ning of the cytoplasmic domain. Arginine 245 is associated with
stronger inhibitory signaling than cysteine 245 (Bari et al., 2009).
That theKIR2DL1 alleles encoding arginine 245 are predominantly
on Cen-A, whereas the alleles encoding cysteine 245 are predomi￾nantly on Tel-B, illustrates the more general phenomenon that the
alleles present on Cen-A and Tel-A segments are functionally dif￾ferent from those on Cen-B and Tel-B segments (Pyo et al., 2010).
From the KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 alleles described here
we see how polymorphism can modulate receptor avidity and
specificity for ligand, receptor integrity and cell-surface expres￾sion, and the strength of signal transduction. The study of further
variants is likely to uncover aspects of HLA-C reactive KIR func￾tion that are modulated by the natural polymorphism in human
populations.
PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS FURTHER DIVERSIFY
KIR–HLA INTERACTIONS
In addition to KIR interactions with the α1 and α2 domains of
HLA class I, the co-crystal structures show that KIR also make
direct contacts with the HLA-bound peptide, consistent with the
peptide-specific differences observed in biochemical and func￾tional studies (Malnati et al., 1995; Rajagopalan and Long, 1997;
Zappacosta et al., 1997; Table 6). In fact, all the various KIR–
HLA class I combinations examined have shown some degree of
peptide selectivity (Malnati et al., 1995; Rajagopalan and Long,
1997; Zappacosta et al., 1997; Hansasuta et al., 2004; Colantonio
et al., 2011).
KIR binding and function are particularly sensitive to the
residue at position 8, with the neighboring position 7 contribut￾ing an additional, but weaker effect (Rajagopalan and Long, 1997;
Boyington et al., 2000). These findings are compatible with the
footprints of bound KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2 on the HLA-C*04:01
and HLA-C*03:04 molecules, respectively, that show interaction
with residues 7 and 8 of the peptide (Boyington et al., 2000; Fan
et al., 2001). For KIR2DL2 interaction with C1, glutamine 71 of
KIR forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of the alanine
at position 8 of the peptide. Additional KIR residues (lysine-44,
serine 184, and asparagine-187), which are in close proximity
to the peptide bound by HLA-C, further restrict the size of the
residue at position 8 in the peptides that permit KIR binding.
This limitation favors small residues such as alanine and serine,
while disfavoring large side chains (Boyington et al., 2000; Fan
et al., 2001). The crystal structure of KIR2DS2 revealed a dis￾placement of glutamine 71 that is predicted to prevent hydrogen
bonding with the main chain nitrogen of peptide residue 8, which

likely contributes to the poor C1 binding observed for KIR2DS2
(Saulquin et al., 2003).
Moreover, peptide-HLA combinations that bind KIR weakly
appear to function as peptide antagonists, by competing with
strongly binding peptides for complex formation with HLA-C.
Fadda et al. (2010) identified peptides that bind to and stabilize
the cell-surface expression of HLA, but do not support a high
affinity KIR/HLA interaction. These peptides compete with KIR￾permissible peptides for availability of HLA-C, and downmodulate
KIR-mediated inhibition by lowering the number of inhibitory
KIR ligands on target cells. Such sensitivity to peptide interactions
could enable NK cells to sense subtle changes in the peptide reper￾toire, as occurs during viral infections. In principle this would
be a more sensitive sensory mechanism than the large-scale alter￾ations of HLA expression on target cells that cause self-HLA class
I to be missing (Rajagopalan and Long, 2010). Fadda et al. (2010)
also found that this effect is more prevalent for KIR2DL3 than for
KIR2DL2, presumably due to the stronger inhibitory interaction
of the later with C1.
CO-EVOLUTION OF MHC-C WITH LINEAGE III KIR
Comparison of KIR specificities in human and non-human pri￾mate species shows has that KIR recognition of MHC-A and
MHC-B preceded the emergence of MHC-C and its evolution to
become a more specialized and superior KIR ligand than MHC-A
and MHC-B (Older Aguilar et al., 2011). Co-evolving with MHC￾C are the lineage III KIR, that includes all the MHC-C reactive
KIR and which were expanded from a single gene into a family of
genes with the emergence of MHC-C. When MHC-C first evolved
from an MHC-B-like gene, in the common hominid ancestor,
it carried only the C1 epitope, a state preserved by modern
orangutan MHC-C. Through mutations at position 80 in MHC-C
and position 44 in lineage III KIR, C2 (lysine-80) evolved from
C1 (asparagine 80), and C2-specific KIR (methionine 44) evolved
from C1-specific KIR (lysine-44). This involved an intermediate
form of KIR that reacted with both C1 and C2 and had glutamate
44 (Moesta et al., 2009; Older Aguilar et al., 2010). In its reactivity
with C1 and cross-reactivity with C2, KIR2DL2 has similarity to
this intermediate.
One characteristic feature of the co-evolution between vari￾able NK cell receptors and MHC class I ligands is the transience
of individual ligand–receptor pairs, and even whole systems of
ligand–receptor pairs. A second feature is formation of inhibitory
and activating receptors with similar specificities for MHC class I.
In such pairs of receptors the inhibitory receptors tend to be longer
lasting, whereas their activating counterparts tend to become sub￾ject to selection that attenuates their function (Abi-Rached and
Parham, 2005). This trend is most apparent in the human species,
and exemplified by KIR2DS2, for which C1 binding is unde￾tectable. In contrast, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan all have
activating C1-specific KIR for which the binding to C1 bearing
MHC-C is readily detected (Moesta et al., 2010).
EDUCATION, REPERTOIRE, AND VARIEGATED EXPRESSION
Although much debated, almost all mature human NK cells
express at least one inhibitory receptor that recognizes a ubiq￾uitously expressed self-HLA class I molecule: either HLA-A, B, C,
or E (Valiante et al., 1997). Because KIR and HLA are not geneti￾cally linked on the same chromosome, the co-evolution of KIR
with HLA class I cannot lead to the co-segregation in human

Moesta and Parham KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 specificities
populations of favorable combinations of KIR and HLA class I.
This property combines with the polymorphism of both receptors
and ligands, to produce a situation in which numerous individu￾als have KIR without a cognate HLA class I ligand and/or an HLA
ligand without its cognate KIR.
The HLA class I receptors are expressed at late stages in human
NK cell development, with CD94:NKG2A, being expressed first
(Miller and McCullar, 2001; Freud et al., 2006; Cooley et al., 2007).
CD94:NKG2A provides the NK cell with a guaranteed inhibitory
receptor for self-HLA class I. Subsequently, transcription is ini￾tiated at the KIR locus. Here, a system of competing sense and
anti-sense promoters (Davies et al., 2007; Stulberg et al., 2007)
means that each NK cell expresses only a subset of the KIR genes,
a phenomenon described as variegated expression (Trowsdale,
2001), which in turn imparts considerable phenotypic diversity
to the NK cell population. Once an NK cell expresses KIR they can
survey the set of self-MHC class I to see if it includes a cognate lig￾and. If there is no such ligand, then the NK cell uses CD94:NKG2A
as its self receptor (Grzywacz et al., 2006). If a KIR engages its cog￾nate ligand then expression of CD94:NKG2A is turned off and
the NK cell uses the KIR as its self receptor (Yu et al., 2010). This
process, whereby a developing NK cell is influenced by the signals
generated through engagement of ligand by a self-MHC class I
receptor, is called NK cell education (Anfossi et al., 2006).
In addition to the C1 and C2 epitopes recognized by lineage
III KIR, two other HLA epitopes are recognized by the lineage
II KIR. These comprise the Bw4 epitope carried by subsets of
HLA-A and -B allotypes, and the A3/11 epitope carried by a small
minority of HLA-A allotypes. Of the four epitopes C1, C2, and
Bw4 can educate NK cells, but the A3/11 epitope cannot (Fauriat
et al., 2008; Yawata et al., 2008). With few exceptions every human
individual has either C1 or the C2 epitope (or both) to educate NK
cells, whereas 25% of the human population lack the Bw4 epitope
(Norman et al., 2007). This again illustrates the leading role played
by HLA-C in providing KIR ligands.
While the mechanisms underlying NK cell education are poorly
understood and remain a matter for debate, there is good evidence
showing that HLA-C reactive KIR play a role in education (Anfossi
et al., 2006; Fauriat et al., 2008, 2010; Yawata et al., 2008). What is
less certain is the extent to which the selective process of NK cell
education, which varies with HLA class I type, influences the NK
cell repertoire of KIR expression. Investigation of this question by
several groups has led to different conclusions. Study of Japanese
donors (most of whom were homozygous for A KIR haplotypes)
reported a strong influence of HLA-C type on the distribution
of inhibitory KIR (Yawata et al., 2008), whereas a study of Euro￾pean donors who were also homozygous for A KIR haplotypes
found no correlation between HLA-C allotype distribution and
KIR expression (Andersson et al., 2009). But another study of
European donors homozygous for A KIR haplotypes detected a
dominant effects of C2 or C1 homozygosity on the frequencies
of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3/3 expression by NK cells (Schonberg
et al., 2011). Thus, in C2 homozygous donors, NK cells expressing
KIR2DL1 were most frequent, whereas in C1 homozygous donors
NK cells expressing KIR2DL2 were most frequent. In donors with
a B KIR haplotype, the effect of C2 on the frequency of KIR2DL1
expression was abrogated by the presence of KIR2DL2.
KIR2DS1 also contributes to NK cell education. KIR2DS1
expressing NK cells are hyporesponsive to C2/C2 targets, even if
those NK cells expressed KIR2DL3 or CD94/NKG2A (Fauriat et al.,
2010). This is consistent with the ability of KIR2DS1 to override
NKG2A-mediated inhibition on NK cells educated in the absence
of C2, but subsequently exposed to C2-bearing target cells, as
would occur during haploidentical bone marrow transplantation
(Foley et al., 2008).
FUNCTION: ROLE IN INFECTION
The heightened susceptibility of patients with NK cell deficiencies
to recurrent viral infections (Orange, 2002) strongly implicates NK
cells in protection against viral infections. Subsequent epidemio￾logical studies have correlated either KIR alone, or combinations of
KIR and HLA class I with susceptibility, resistance, and chronicity
of viral infections (Khakoo and Carrington, 2006).
Increased resolution of acute hepatitis C viral infection was
observed for individuals who were homozygous for KIR2DL3
and HLA-C1. This report concluded that the weaker inhibitory
interaction of KIR2DL3 with C1, but not the stronger inhibitory
interaction of KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL1 with C1 and C2, respec￾tively, allows penetrance of activating signals during viral infection
(Khakoo et al., 2004).
Similar relationships of activation versus inhibition have been
seen in studies on the recurrence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infec￾tion following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), where a
larger number of activating KIR correlates with fewer recurrences
(Chen et al., 2006; Zaia et al., 2009). Similarly, recurrence of CMV
infection following kidney transplant appears to be reduced in the
presence of multiple activating receptors (Stern et al., 2008) and/or
in the absence of inhibitory KIR–ligand pairs (Hadaya et al., 2008).
Specifically, absence of either interaction between KIR2DL1 and
C2, or between KIR2DL2/3 and C1 were found to be the primary
components of this association (Hadaya et al., 2008).
For HIV infection an extensive set of associations has
been made with the Bw4 epitopes carried by HLA-B and the
KIR3DL1/S1 receptors of lineage II (Martin et al., 2002, 2007;Alter
et al., 2007). More recently, evidence for interplay between HIV
and KIR2DL2 has been reported (Alter et al., 2011). In individ￾uals who have KIR2DL2 and are HIV-infected, KIR2DL2+ NK
cells are activated by virus-infected CD4 T cells. This interac￾tion appears to select for variant viruses, in which the capacity of
KIR2DL2 to bind and/or respond to infected CD4 T cells is lost.
The implication of this finding is that variant viral peptides alter
the repertoire of peptides bound by HLA-C, causing NK cell inhi￾bition instead of an NK cell response. Although the authors focus
on KIR2DL2, they cannot rule out involvement of KIR2DS2 (Alter
et al., 2011). Furthermore, individuals with HLA-C allotypes that
have genetically determined high cell-surface expression, progress
more slowly to AIDS and control the viral load significantly bet￾ter than individuals with low HLA-C expressing alleles (Thomas
et al., 2009). Unknown, however, is whether this effect is directly
related to KIR/HLA-C interactions or presentation to cytotoxic T
cells, since no correlation has been found with specific HLA-C
reactive KIR.

the presence of KIR2DL2 was correlated with enhanced protec￾tion when combined with protective HLA class I (HLA-C*08 for
HTLV-1 and HLA-B*57 for HCV), but exacerbated the detri￾mental effect of HLA-B*54 on HTLV-1 (Seich Al Basatena et al.,
2011). Rather than mediating a direct NK cell-mediated effect,
it is proposed that KIR2DL2 expressed on CD8+ T cells mod￾ulates the T cell response to the virus (Seich Al Basatena et al.,
2011). Similar effects of KIR on CD8+ T cell responses have
been reported in the context of HIV (Alter et al., 2008), EBV
(Poon et al., 2005), and CMV (Chen et al., 2006; van der Veken
et al., 2009).
FUNCTION: ROLE IN AUTOIMMUNITY
Susceptibility to numerous autoimmune diseases has been cor￾related with genes in the HLA complex, and frequently they are
the strongest genetic associations with the disease (Lechler and
Warrens, 2000). With some notable exceptions, such as HLA-B*27
with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis with HLA-C*06 (Diaz￾Pena et al., 2009; Reveille, 2011), the stronger associations have
tended to be with the HLA class II genes. Because HLA class I and
KIR form functional ligand–receptor pairs there is the appealing
possibility that combinations of particular functionally interacting
HLA and KIR variants will give stronger correlations with disease
than either component alone.
Many exploratory studies have been made on cohorts of
patients and controls that were previously analyzed for HLA type,
and subsequently typed for KIR gene-content diversity. Some
examples of the results are shown in Table 7. The foundation
for human KIR diversity is the difference between the A and B
haplotypes and their constituent centromeric and telomeric gene
motifs. A common feature of the associations with autoimmune
diseases is that B haplotypes, or their components, are associ￾ated with susceptibility to autoimmune disease (Parham, 2005).
For example, susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris is correlated with
the presence of KIR2DS1 and HLA-Cw*06 (Luszczek et al., 2004;
Suzuki et al., 2004), whereas the risk for type I diabetes risk is ele￾vated for individuals having the receptor–ligand combination of
KIR2DS2 and HLA-C1, but lacking the C2 and Bw4 epitopes that
engage other inhibitory KIR (van der Slik et al., 2003). In other
instances, the contribution of individual KIR is more difficult to
establish.
As we have emphasized here, the formidable linkage disequi￾librium between KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 makes it difficult to
distinguish their respective contributions, as in ulcerative colitis.
Here KIR2DL3 in the presence of HLA-C1 had a protective effect,
while the presence of KIR2DL2/2DS2 increased the risk of disease
(Jones et al., 2006). Similarly, B haplotype KIR2DL2, but not A
haplotype KIR2DL3 has been linked with several autoimmune

conditions, including type I diabetes (van der Slik et al., 2003),
psoriatic arthritis (Martin et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2004), and
ulcerative colitis (Jones et al., 2006). In dissecting the separate
roles of KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2, rare KIR haplotypes that have
the KIR2DS2 gene without the neighboring KIR2DL2 gene are
likely to be informative. In studying scleroderma patients, Momot
et al. (2004) showed that disease was associated with the individu￾als who had KIR2DS2 but lacked KIR2DL2. At face value it seems
that an upset in the usual balance between KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2
is the cause of the increased risk of disease.
On several counts the interpretation of the disease associations
has not been simple. First, the data are often not sufficiently
robust, because of the small sizes of the cohorts examined and
the lack of replication in a further cohort. Second, the asso￾ciations often involve KIR for which functions and ligands are
poorly understood, as exemplified by KIR2DS2. Thirdly, because
KIR are expressed both on NK cells and T cells of memory phe￾notype (van Bergen and Koning, 2010), the cellular basis for
the genetic correlations is not established. Lastly, because the
disease-association studies are usually restricted to examining the
presence and absence of KIR genes they are insensitive to the rich
allelic polymorphism in which the KIR factors associated with
autoimmunity or more likely to be found.
FUNCTION: ROLE IN HEMATOPOIETIC CELL
TRANSPLANTATION
Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been to the fore of research
on KIR, because of observations made on leukemia patients who
received an HLA haploidentical transplant from a relative when
no HLA-identical donor was available from either the family or
the international registries of unrelated donors (Ruggeri et al.,
2002). For these transplants the shared HLA haplotype enables the
donor-derived lymphocytes to interact with the HLA class I and
II antigens expressed by the recipient’s non-hematopoietic cells.
The mismatched HLA haplotype can cause a burst of alloreactive
NK cells in the transplanted patient that can improve the out￾come by reducing the likelihood of leukemic relapse, presumably
by killing residual leukemia cells. Such a graft-versus-leukemia
(GVL) effect is principally seen against myeloid leukemias and not
lymphocytic leukemias, perhaps reflecting the physiological inter￾actions that occur between NK cells and myeloid cells, notably
dendritic cells.
The occurrence of the GVL effect is determined by the HLA
mismatch between the donor and recipient, particularly in the
distribution of the C1 and C2 epitopes. A GVL effect occurs
when the donor has an epitope, either C1 or C2, that the recip￾ient lacks. This is a case of missing-self recognition: some NK
cells that have become educated on the donor’s HLA-C allotypes
are unable to be inhibited by the recipient’s cells including the
leukemia. The burst of alloreactive NK cells appears transient,
for as the patients hematopoietic system becomes fully reconsti￾tuted a state of tolerance is reached. The GVL can also provide the
recovering transplant recipient protection from CMV infection
(Velardi et al., 2012).
As in the case of the autoimmune diseases, many of the studies
rely on cohorts of transplant donor and recipient pairs, for which
HLA-C types and clinical outcomes were reanalyzed in the context
of the C1 and C2 epitopes. The implied effects of alloreactive NK
cells on transplant outcome are mixed, and appear to depend on
differences in the protocols used for transplantation. A key feature
of the transplants described by Velardi and colleagues (Ruggeri
et al., 2002; Velardi et al., 2012) is rigorous depletion of T cells
from the graft. In contrast, in transplants performed with T cell
replete grafts a detrimental effect was found when the donor has
an epitope lacking in the recipient (Sun et al., 2007).
KIR genes also influence the outcome of HCT, but also only
for recipients treated for myeloid leukemia. Donors with KIR B
haplotypes give better outcome than donors who are A haplo￾type homozygotes (Cooley et al., 2009). This effect is mainly due
to the Cen-B motif, but there is also a contribution from Tel B
(Cooley et al., 2010). Thus it is the combination of KIR2DL2 and
KIR2DS2 in the donor that is implicated in the effect, which is also
improved by the recipient having the C1 epitope, the main ligand
for KIR2DL2 (Cooley et al., submitted).
FUNCTION: ROLE IN PREGNANCY OUTCOME
A subset of NK cells resident in the uterus plays a critical role in
formation of the placenta early in pregnancy. By modulating the
invasion of fetal extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs), uterine NK
(uNK) cells affect the remodeling of maternal spiral arteries, a
process that is crucial for ensuring sufficient blood and nutrient
flow across the placenta. Insufficient trophoblast invasion has been
implicated in pregnancy disorders, including preeclampsia, recur￾rent miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction. KIR interaction with
HLA-C appears to play a major role in controlling this interaction.
This is because EVT express HLA-C but not HLA-A or HLA-B,
thus HLA-C is the only polymorphic HLA class I expressed by the
fetal cells that contact the maternal circulation (Apps et al., 2009).
Correspondingly, the KIR repertoires of uNK cells are skewed
toward HLA-C reactive KIR and express these receptors at high
levels on the cell surface, as evidenced by increased staining with
HLA-C tetramers (Sharkey et al., 2008). Paralleling the situation
in HCT, the independent genetic segregation of KIR and HLA pro￾vides for the potential in pregnancy to have mismatches between
maternal KIR-bearing NK cells and fetal HLA class I, since EVT
express both the maternally and paternally inherited HLA-C alleles
(Hiby et al., 2010).
Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk for
preeclampsia, recurrent miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction
for mothers who are homozygous for the KIR A haplotype, an
effect that is further increased when the fetus expresses the C2
epitope, particularly if inherited from the father (Hiby et al., 2004,
2010). Thus interaction of inhibitory KIR2DL1 on maternal uNK
cells with C2 on EVT is implicated in increasing the risk of preg￾nancy disorder. A protective effect is correlated with KIR2DS1 on
Tel-B, and is presumably caused by functional interaction of this
activating NK cell receptor with C2, suggesting that the increased
activation of maternal uNK cells stimulated greater trophoblast
invasion (Hiby et al., 2010). Furthermore, paternal inheritance of
C2 appears to play a dominant effect, suggesting that education
of uNK cells in the presence of maternal C2 may dampen the
influence of an unfavorable KIR–HLA combination.
None of the C1-reactive KIR have been directly implicated in
affecting susceptibility to pregnancy disorders, but have to be

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Prompted by observations of HSCT (Ruggeri et al., 2002),
responses to viral infections (Khakoo et al., 2004), and suc￾cess in pregnancy (Hiby et al., 2004), it is now appreciated
that HLA-C reactive KIR play a critical role in NK cell func￾tion, but must be examined in the context of their ligands.
Beyond the allotypic delineation between C1 and C2, under￾standing how HLA polymorphism affects NK cell function is
limited. Owing to the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA-C
locus, allelic effects on peptide repertoire, cell-surface expres￾sion and on the KIR–HLA interface are all likely to further
diversify KIR–HLA interactions, but they have yet to be stud￾ied in depth. Similarly, allelic differences of the HLA-C reactive
KIR have been studied for their effects on the interaction with
HLA-C. A recent in-depth analysis of positively selected residues
of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 revealed subtle modulation of the
KIR–HLA interaction (Hilton et al., 2012), and also suggests that
HLA-C*04:01, a C2 allele commonly used in functional and bio￾chemical assays may have properties that are not representative
of all C2 allotypes. These findings strengthen the need to fur￾ther our understanding of the diversified interactions of KIR with
HLA-C.
