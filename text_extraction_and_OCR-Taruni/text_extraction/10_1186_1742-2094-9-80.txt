Abstract
Background: In multiple sclerosis relapses refractory to intravenous corticosteroid therapy, plasma exchange is
recommended. Immunoadsorption (IA) is regarded as an alternative therapy, but its efficacy and putative
mechanism of action still needs to be established.
Methods: We prospectively treated 11 patients with multiple sclerosis who had optical neuritis and fulfilled the
indications for apheresis therapy (Trial registration DE/CA25/00007080-00). In total, five IA treatments were
performed using tryptophan-IA. Clinical activity (visual acuity, Expanded Disability Status Scale, Incapacity Status
Scale), laboratory values and visual evoked potentials were measured before, during and after IA, with a follow-up
of six months. Moreover, proteomic analyses were performed to analyze column-bound proteins as well as
corresponding changes in patients’ sera.
Results: After the third IA, we detected an improvement of vision in eight of eleven patients, whom we termed
responders. Amongst these, the mean visual acuity improved from 0.15 ± 0.12 at baseline to 0.47 ± 0.32 after the
third IA (P = 0.0252) up to 0.89 ± 0.15 (P < 0.0001) at day 180 ± 10 after IA. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor decreased
in responders (P = 0.03), whereas in non-responders it did not. Proteomic analyses of proteins adsorbed to IA
columns revealed that several significant immunological proteins as well as central nervous system protein
fragments, including myelin basic protein, had been removed by IA.
Conclusions: IA was effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory optic neuritis. IA influenced the humoral
immune response. Strikingly, however, we found strong evidence that demyelination products and immunological
mediators were also cleared from plasma by IA.

Background
Previous studies have described four immunopathological
patterns of demyelination in early multiple sclerosis (MS)
lesions, with pattern II being characterized by antibody
and/or complement-associated demyelination [1]. Several
specific antibodies have been described and discussed
to contribute to the humoral autoimmune response in
MS [2]. Immunoglobulins are synthesized intrathecally;
however, at least part of the humoral response in MS is
derived systemically from the blood [3].
Therapeutic plasma exchange (PE) is based on the sep￾aration of plasma from cellular blood components, allow￾ing the removal of substances up to a molecular weight of
3 × 103 kDa. As shown in a randomized placebo controlled
cross-over study, PE was efficient for steroid - refractory
relapses in about 40% to 50% of cases of acute central
nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases [4].
The usefulness of PE has also been extended to severe
optic neuritis in patients with MS [5,6]. Thus, the use of
PE in steroid-refractory relapses has become an integral

part of European guidelines for the treatment of MS [7].
Clinical-pathological correlation analyses have shown that
all patients with pattern II pathology but none with
pattern I or pattern III experienced improvement in
neurological deficits after being treated with PE [8]. This
selective response suggests a removal of pathogenic
humoral and plasma factors by PE.
Immunoadsorption (IA) provides a more selective
approach and the potential for technical innovations in
therapeutic apheresis techniques, allowing the elimination
of pathogenic antibodies while sparing other plasma
proteins. With IA, relevant side effects of PE resulting
from protein substitution can be avoided [9]. We hypothe￾sized that IA is at least equally efficient compared to PE as
an escalation therapy for steroid-unresponsive relapses of
MS. Therefore, we performed a prospective trial to
compare IA treatment in 11 patients with MS with our
earlier patient population treated with PE for their MS
[10]. In addition, proteomic analyses of column-bound
proteins were performed as well as measurements of
corresponding changes in patients’ plasma samples.
Methods
Patients
We prospectively included 11 consecutive patients with
MS who had functionally disabling acute optical neuritis.
Patients fulfilled the indications for apheresis treatment
due to this steroid-unresponsive MS relapse according
to German guidelines (http://www.dgn.org) [7].
The study protocol had been approved by the local
ethics committee prior to study initiation (no. 2/4/07)
and registered at the local government (no. DE/CA25/
00007080-00). All patients gave their written informed
consent before enrolment.
Immunoadsorption treatment
IA was performed using the tryptophan-linked polyvinyl
alcohol adsorber TR-350, after membrane plasma separ￾ation with the polyethylene plasma separator OP-05 W
(Asahi Kasei Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan) in combination with
the Octo Nova extracorporeal circuit technology (SW
4.30.2, front 4.30.0) (Diamed Medizintechnik, Cologne,
Germany). The adsorber, plasma separator and tubing
system were for single use only. Combined anticoagulation,
with citrate and unfractionated heparin, was used for all
treatments. The treated plasma volume was 2,500 mL
plasma for all treatments of all patients. In total, five
sessions were performed in each patient on alternate days.
In case of complications or decrease of fibrinogen below
100 mg/dL, treatment-free intervals were extended
individually. Internal jugular veins were used for central
vascular access with double lumen catheters in all patients.
Baseline and follow-up visits
All patients were followed up by a neurologist. Visits were
performed at baseline (visit 0), after each IA treatment
(visits 2 to 5) and after 30 ± 5 days (visit 6), 60 ± 10 days
(visit 7) and 180 ± 10 days (visit 8). The neurological find￾ings were assessed using the Expanded Disability Status
Scale (EDSS) and the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS) [11-13].
Changes of visual acuity were monitored using standar￾dized near vision types after correction of refractive error
at each visit and confirmed by an ophthalmologist before
and after IA, as well as at 180 ± 10 days. Visual evoked
potentials were determined at baseline, after the last IA
and 60 ± 10 days post-intervention with the Neuropack
M1 (Nihon Koden, Surbiton, UK).
Classification of side effects
Side effects were defined as any unexpected or symptom￾atic event that had a possible, probable or definite causal
relationship with IA treatment [14]. They were classified
as mild, moderate or severe as described previously [15]
with small modifications. Briefly, mild side effects included
those of transient nature with little or no clinical signifi￾cance and without any temporary break of the procedure.
Side effects that required medical intervention but were
not life-threatening were classified as moderate. Unstable
and life-threatening events requiring termination of the
procedure were classified as severe.
Clinical chemistry
All laboratory parameters were measured by standard
methods. The complement components C3c and C4
as well as the immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA) and
M (IgM) were measured by nephelometry (Behring
Nephelometer II Analyzer, Germany). Soluble interleukin-2
receptor (sIL-2R) was detected on an immulite system
(Siemens, Germany).
Identification of immunoadsorption column-binding
proteins by elution and proteomics
Immusorba TR-350 column-binding proteins were eluted
after the first IA treatment in five of eleven patients. Prior
to elution, the column was washed with PBS buffer. The
protein elution was carried out as following: PBS-washing
step was followed by a three-step elution protocol using
solution A (100 mM sodium acetate, 1 M NaCl, pH 5),
solution B (20 mM Tris–HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.5) and
solution C (20% acetonitril in double diluted H2O).
Proteins eluted from all three steps were pooled together
and aliquots of 10 mL were used for protein precipitation,
protein estimation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, protein visual￾ization and image analysis, in-gel digestion, mass spec￾trometry analysis of the digestion products and protein
identification using a database search were performed as

described in detail in our previous publication [16]. For
protein identification, qualitative criteria encompassed
optimized mass accuracy (<50 ppm), minimal mass de￾viation (in the millidalton range) and highest possible
probability score, which were assigned to each identified
protein. Proteins identified by mass spectrometry are
described qualitatively.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were performed according to
previously published data [17] with 20 μg of plasma
proteins. Equal loading was ascertained by Coomassie
staining. For immunodetection of proteins, the following
antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal to human CD5
ligand (CD5L) and mouse monoclonal to human myelin
basic protein (both Abcam, Cambridge, UK); and horse￾radish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody
(Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Results are
expressed as mean ± SD.
Statistics
Visit and response effects were studied by two-way
repeated measures analysis of variance using the
mixed procedure for the software SAS (version 9.1,
SAS Institute). In this global analysis, P < 0.05 indi￾cated a significant effect. In the case of a significant
effect at a particular visit, subsequent pairwise com￾parisons to baseline values were performed using
one-way repeated measures analysis of variance to de￾tect the point in time when the effect occurred. These
comparisons were performed at Bonferroni-adjusted sig￾nificance levels (related P-values are labeled with either
Bonf. sig. (significant) or with Bonf. n.s. (non-significant)).
Smoothing splines with three degrees of freedom were
fitted to mean values of each visit to illustrate the trends
and the potential interactions between visits and response
effects. Fitting was performed using the free software R
(version 2.8, http://www.r-project.org).
Comparative statistical analyses of changes within-sub￾ject and within-treatment were performed using t-tests for
paired samples in case of normal data and Mann–Whitney
U-tests for non-normal data. Normality was checked by
quantile-quantile plots. Again, test results with P < 0.05
were considered significant.
Results
IA treatments were started after a mean time of 26.6 days
after the initial symptoms and 10.8 days after the start of
corticosteroid therapy. Each patient received at least two
courses of corticosteroid therapy prior to IA therapy,
with a mean cumulative dose of 10.9 g prednisolone
equivalent but without a significant improvement, thus
fulfilling the indication of therapeutic apheresis as
adjunct treatment. An improvement of visual acuity up
to 0.6 or more was achieved in eight of eleven patients
(72.7%) undergoing IA treatment (responder group).
Two patients did not respond to therapy at any time
point and one patient improved during IA therapy but
deteriorated shortly after the end of IA therapy, asso￾ciated with the incidence of a jugular venous thrombosis
on the same side (non-responder group). The relevant
data of patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Visual acuity
Mean visual acuity of all patients significantly improved
with a baseline value of 0.12 ± 0.12 before the start of IA,
0.36 ± 0.33 (P = 0.0234) after the third IA and 0.72 ± 0.38
(day 180 ± 10 after IA; P < 0.001). The effect was even
more pronounced in the responder group. Mean visual
acuity before start of IA was 0.15 ± 0.12 with an increase
after the third IA to 0.47 ± 0.32 (P = 0.0252 Bonf. n.s.)
and even more up to 0.89 ± 0.15 (P < 0.0001 Bonf. sig.)
at day 180 ± 10 after IA. By contrast, in the non-re￾sponder group, no significant changes of visual acuity
were detectable. Results are summarized in Figure 1.
Relief of visual impairment inversely correlated with
the time interval between the start of symptoms and
the beginning of IA therapy (r = -0.539) with a trend
(P = 0.08) favoring positive clinical response in early
opposed to late IA initiation.
Visual evoked potentials
Before IA treatment, visual evoked potentials could not
be identified in six of our patients with MS due to the
severity of the optical neuritis. However, after treatment
in four of these participants, potentials recovered at day
60. In five patients, the visual evoked potential ampli￾tudes as well as latencies before and after IA could be
compared. The mean amplitude was 2.31 ± 2.57 mV at
baseline, 3.34 ± 2.60 mV after the last IA, and
5.69 ± 1.76 mV at day 60 (P = 0.37). Latencies did not
show recovery in those five patients from baseline
(107.6 ± 21.7 ms) until day 60 ± 10 (112.3 ± 17.1 ms).
Expanded disability status scale and incapacity status scale
The EDSS continuously improved in the responder
group starting from 4.06 ± 1.82 at baseline to 3.44 ± 2.38
after the last IA to a minimum of 2.81 ± 2.72 at day
60 ± 10 (P = 0.58), in contrast to the non-responder
group who showed no changes. However, EDSS is clearly
dominated by ambulation [12] and rather insensitive for
visual dysfunction [13]. In parallel, ISS ameliorated in
the responder group from 8.00 ± 9.02 at baseline with a
continuous decrease to a minimum of 5.75 ± 6.78 at day
180 ± 10 (P = 0.04), in contrast to no significant changes
in the non-responder group.

Side effects
In total, 55 IA treatments were analyzed. Mild side effects
were often reported and caused slight discomfort to the
patients, such as coldness, cough, dizziness, headache,
temporary hypertension, lacrimation, muscular cramps,
nausea, palpations, pruritus, paresthesia, rhinorrhea,
sweating, tinnitus or vomiting. They were transient and
could be easily managed without therapy.
Ten moderate side effects were recorded during the
IA phase. These included vascular access problems such
as central venous catheter infection and jugular venous
thrombosis as well as therapy-associated events that
included chest pain, dyspnoe, transient hypotension and
urticaria, which could be easily managed by approved
medical interventions. Two patients developed febrile
infections (common cold and phlebitis of a peripheral
vein) within 24 h of IA, which were possibly related to
short-term immune dysfunction caused by corticosteroid
therapy and IA. No severe side effects occurred. Results
are summarized in Table 2.
Laboratory data
In routine analyses, no significant changes were seen for
the following values: partial thromboplastin time,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes, sodium, calcium,
creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotrans￾ferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase,
creatine kinase and C-reactive protein. Significant changes
were detected for fibrinogen, leukocytes and total protein.
Increased leukocyte counts at baseline were likely caused
by corticosteroid therapy before starting IA.
Immunoglobulins IgA, IgG and IgM as well as
complement components C3c and C4 significantly
decreased during IA therapy (P < 0.01). After the end of
IA, however, these parameters gradually recovered and
increased beyond baseline values (as shown for IgG and
C3c in Figure 2A, B). We found a significant decrease of
sIL-2R at a rate of -35.4 ± 20.7% (P = 0.0054) after just one
IA session in our patients with MS. Furthermore, time￾courses of sIL-2R in responders and non-responders
showed a significant difference (P = 0.03; Figure 2C). Sam￾ple dilution in the patients’ circulation due to IA was
excluded by laboratory follow-ups of hematocrit and albu￾min in serum.
Proteomic data
Our proteomic investigation allowed the identification of
41 proteins with a peptide mass fingerprinting-score

>65 in eluates of IA columns. We could identify apoli￾poproteins, hemorheologically relevant proteins, im￾munologically relevant proteins, myelin-related proteins
and others. A representative two-dimensional gel is
shown in Figure 3A and results are summarized in
Table 3.
Amongst all identified proteins, soluble CD5L and the
myelin basic protein (MBP) fragment were quantitatively
analyzed in patients’ sera by western blots using specific
antibodies (Figure 3B). The baseline value was set to
100% and follow-up values were given in percent of
baseline. Plasma MBP levels significantly decreased
during the first IA session to 46.4 ± 15.0% (P < 0.001)
and remained low even in the post-IA control at day
60 ± 10. In parallel, soluble CD5L (sCD5L) levels
decreased to 50.5 ± 15.0% (P < 0.001) after the first IA
and remained subsequently low. Time-courses of sCD5L
and MBP are shown in Figure 3B.
Discussion
PE is an efficient treatment in acute central nervous sys￾tem inflammatory demyelinating diseases [4], including
severe optic neuritis, motor impairment or ataxia [5,6]
after steroid-refractory relapses, successful in about 40%
to 50% of cases. Here, we report on the first prospective
investigation of tryptophan-IA in 11 relapsing MS
patients with optic neuritis refractory to corticosteroid
pulses in an open prospective study. Overall, eight of

eleven patients (72.7%) achieved a remission. One patient
gradually improved but deteriorated again along with the
development of jugular venous thrombosis, and two
patients did not respond at all. The response to IA seems
to be comparable to the best results achieved in PE series
[5,6] and to two very recent retrospective analyses of the
effect of IA in steroid-refractory MS cases [18,19]. As in
our own PE study [10], significant clinical improvement
was seen after the third extracorporeal treatment session
with a trend in favor of early IA initiation compared to
delayed IA initiation. Our treatment protocol was limited
to a total of five IA sessions. Additional experience
showed that increasing the number of apheresis sessions
did not correlate with further improvement of outcome
(data not shown). This observation is in accord with
results of IA in acute autoimmune neuropathies like
Guillain-Barré Syndrome [20].
Most side effects were typical of any apheresis proced￾ure using central venous lines as vascular access, but not
characteristic of IA. Compared with the safety data from
previously published PE studies [15,21], the incidence of
mild adverse events was higher in our study, and moder￾ate side effects were slightly more frequent. However,
moderate side effects were almost level with our own
study of neurological patients treated with PE [15].
Potential side effects of PE known to be related to the
substitution of human plasma products were completely
avoided [12].
Apart from clinical data, we analyzed possible therapeutic
effects of IA with the help of proteomic analyses. Several
relevant proteins, particularly fibrinogen and the immuno￾globulins, were monitored. The decrease of fibrinogen is
one limiting factor in the use of tryptophan-IA that makes
regular controls necessary. Our protocol with five IA
sessions on alternate days did not decrease fibrinogen to
critical levels. Moreover, immunoglobulin depletion along
with prior corticosteroid pulse therapy reflects a strong
immunosuppression, which makes close controls of clinical
and laboratory infection signs necessary. Previous investiga￾tions reported that the restoration of serum IgG levels until
day 5 after IA does not result from increased antibody
synthesis, but is probably related to changes of catabolism
and immunoglobulin backflow [7]. Interestingly enough, we
found a significant immunoglobulin increase beyond base￾line values until day 180 ± 10 after the start of IA, suggest￾ing additional mechanisms other than backflow alone.
Several mechanisms of PE action in neuroimmunological
disorders have been described, such as a removal of

pathogenic autoantibodies, a redistribution of pathogens
from the extravascular to the intravascular compartment,
increased proliferation of immune cells, an enhanced
production of immunoglobulins, a promotion of suppres￾sor T-cell function, and a deviation of cytokine patterns
redressing a disturbed T-helper type 1 and T-helper type 2
balance [3]. Although IA has been termed specific, several
studies have demonstrated additional binding properties
of ligands other than immunoglobulins alone [22,23].
According to our proteomics data, several proteins that are
possibly involved in MS pathogenesis are removed from
the plasma by IA, for example, transthyretin [24], serum
amyloid P [24], complement factors [24], clusterin [24],
gelsolin [24], kininogen-1 [24], MBP [25,26], CD5L [27]
and immunoglobulins [1,3,8]. We confirmed a decrease
of serum levels by IA in two of them, MBP and sCD5L.
MBP-like material has been detected in several body fluids
including cerebral spinal fluid and the urine of patients
with MS [28]. Since MBP and other myelin proteins have
been shown to be encephalitogenic in animal models of
MS, they could drive the systemic autoimmune response
in patients with MS. Other investigations have demon￾strated the prevalence of MBP-specific memory B-cells in
the peripheral blood of relapsing patients with remitting
MS that might prime T-cells in lymphoid organs to migrate
into the central nervous system and to elicit IFN-γ secre￾tion [25]. These data were further corroborated with the
evidence of MBP-reactive T-cells among IL-2 expanded
lymphocytes in patients with MS [26]. Thus, removal
of MBP from the plasma by IA might interrupt these
autoimmune mechanisms, although more research in this
hypothesis is definitely needed.
sIL-2R, a marker of TH1 cell activation, is increased in
the serum of patients with relapsing MS [14]. We induced
a significant decrease of sIL-2R after IA in responders, but
not in non-responders. Decreased sIL-2R levels might
reflect the silencing of cellular autoimmune responses
effective only in responders.
Conclusions
Our clinical results show a high clinical efficacy of
tryptophan-IA comparable to PE in the treatment of MS
relapses refractory to corticosteroids. Furthermore, our
experimental data suggest several possible effects on MS
pathogenesis: not only removal of immunoglobulins
and complement from plasma, but also reduced levels
of circulating autoantigens and regulatory proteins.
We suggest that more prospective studies are needed to
confirm and extend our results, to give new insights into
this treatment approach, to optimize therapeutic IA
protocols and, lastly, to investigate further therapeutic
principles, for example, T-cell reactivity to MBP before
and after IA.
