Abstract
Data on the effectiveness of implantable implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) with respect to reducing mortality in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are lacking. The purpose of this meta-analysis
was to compare the mortality of patients with ESRD who have received and not received an ICD. A search was conducted on
January 31, 2013 of Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Studies were selected for inclusion based on the
following criteria. 1) Randomized controlled trial. 2) ESRD patients with heart failure. 3) Device therapy (ICD, CRT-defibrillator
[CRT-D]) used to treat heart failure. 4) Primary outcome is survival analysis. 5) Retrospective study if survival analysis was
performed. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcome was 2-year survival. Odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and a x2
-based test of homogeneity was performed. Three studies
were included in the analysis. The combined OR for OS was 2.245 (95% CI 1.871 to 2.685, P,0.001), indicating that patients
with an ICD had a significantly higher OS than those without an ICD. The combined OR for 2-year survival was 2.312 (95% CI
1.921 to 2.784, P,0.001), indicating that patients with an ICD had a significantly higher 2-year survival rate than those
without an ICD. The use of ICD in patients with ESRD is associated with an increase in the OS and the 2-year survival rate.

Introduction
The number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
receiving dialysis is increasing worldwide. It is estimated that in the
United States alone more than 2 million people will be receiving
dialysis by 2020 [1]. Patients receiving dialysis have approximately
8-fold greater all-cause mortality as compared to the general
population, with cardiovascular disease accounting for approxi￾mately 43% of the mortality [1,2]. Individuals with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) are at a markedly increased risk of death from
cardiovascular causes, including sudden cardiac death (SCD) due
to arrhythmias [3,4].
Implantable implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have
been shown to reduce mortality and the risk of SCD in patients
with severe heart failure as a result of ischemic and nonischemic
cardiomyopathy, and in patients with arrhythmias [5–8]. Howev￾er, data on the effectiveness of ICDs in patients with CKD and
ESRD are lacking, and sometimes conflicting [9–14]. This is in
part because patients with renal disease were often excluded from
ICD studies [15,16]. It has been proposed that the survival
advantage of ICDs in patients with renal disease as suggested by
some studies may be negated as a result of comorbidities such as
anemia, diabetes, and hypertension in these patients [15].
Tompkins et al. [17] reported that bleeding and ICD device￾related complications were significantly more common in patients
with ESRD. Alsheikh-Ali et al. [18] categorized patients by New
York Heart Association (NYHA) class and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). The analysis suggested that the benefits of
ICDs in patients with more advanced disease may be limited by
the greater frequency of deaths due to causes other than
arrhythmias. Bilchick et al. [19] found that CKD was associated
with increased mortality rate in patients undergoing ICD
implantation for the primary prevention of SCD (hazard ratio
[HR] = 2.33). Similarly, a meta-analysis performed by Korantzo￾poulos et al. [20] in 2009 suggested that CKD is associated with
increased mortality in patients who receive ICD therapy.
Given the increase in mortality rate of patients with CKD and
ESRD, and the paucity of data regarding the outcome of ICD
implantation in this group of patients, further investigation is
warranted. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta￾analysis to compare the mortality of ESRD patients receiving
device therapy (ICD) with those who did not received device
therapy.
Methods
Literature Search Strategy
A search was conducted of Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and
Google Scholar using combinations of the search terms: chronic
kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, dialysis, heart failure,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e99418

mortality, survival, device therapy, implantable cardioverter￾defibrillator/ICD, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrilla￾tor/CRT-D. The search date was January 31, 2013. Each
publication was carefully examined, including the names of all
authors, to avoid duplication of data.
Selection criteria
Studies were selected for analysis based on the following
inclusion criteria. 1) Randomized controlled trial. 2) ESRD
patients with heart failure. 3) Device therapy (ICD, CRT￾defibrillator [CRT-D]) used to treat heart failure. 4) Primary
outcome is survival analysis. 5) Retrospective study if the survival
analysis was performed. Exclusion criteria for this analysis were as
follows. 1) Study participants were not ESRD patients. 2) The
study was not designed for ESRD patients with/without device
therapy. 3) Studies that investigated if ESRD is risk factor/
predictor of the prognosis for heart failure patients with device
therapy (ICD, CRT-D). 4) Survival rate was not part of the
analysis.
Data extraction
Studies were identified by two independent reviewers using the
aforementioned search strategy. A third reviewer was consulted
when there was uncertainty regarding eligibility.
The following data were extracted from studies that met the
inclusion criteria: name of the first author, year of publication,
study design, number of participants in each treatment group,
participants’ age and gender, overall survival (OS) rate, median
OS time, 2-year survival rate, rate of comorbidities related to heart
failure
Data analysis
The primary outcome was OS, and the secondary outcome was
2-year survival rate. The primary outcome, OS was used to
evaluate treatment efficacy. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for binary outcomes
and compared between patients with and without device therapy.
A x2
-based test of homogeneity was performed, and the
inconsistency index (I2
) statistic was determined. If I2 was .50%
or .75%, the trials were considered to be heterogeneous or highly
heterogeneous, respectively. An I2
,25% indicated homogeneity
among the studies. When heterogeneity existed between studies
(I2
.50%) a random-effects model was calculated. Otherwise,
fixed-effects models were calculated. Pooled summary statistics for
ORs of the individual studies were reported. Sensitivity analysis
was performed based on the leave-one-out approach. Publication
bias analysis was not performed because the number of studies was
too few to detect an asymmetric funnel [21]. All analyses were
performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis statistical soft￾ware, version 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). A value of P,0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Literature search
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 3
studies were included in this meta-analysis [22–24]. A flowchart of
the study selection is shown in Figure 1. The 3 studies included in
the meta-analysis are summarized in Table 1. Two studies
included only ESRD patients [22,24], whereas one study included
both CKD and ESRD patients [23]. For the purposes of this
analysis, only data of ESRD patients from the study by Khan et al.
[23] were used in the analysis.
Study characteristics and clinical outcomes
The ORs for OS of the 3 studies ranged from 1.164 to 2.317
(Fig. 2). There was homogeneity in the combined OR among the 3
studies (Q = 1.976, I2= 0%, P = 0.372); therefore a fixed-effects
model of analysis was used. Examination of the combined OR
revealed a significant difference between ICD and no-ICD
therapy. The combined OR was 2.245 (95% CI 1.871 to 2.685,
P,0.001), indicating that patients with an ICD had a significantly
higher OS than those without ICD therapy.
The ORs for the 2-year survival rate of the 3 studies ranged
from 1.688 to 3.500 (Fig. 3). There was homogeneity in the 2-year
survival rate between the studies when the data were pooled for
analysis (Q = 1.067, I2= 0.00%, P = 0.586); therefore a fixed￾effects model of analysis was used. Examination of the combined
OR revealed a significant difference between ICD and no-ICD
therapy. The combined OR was 2.312 (95% CI 1.921 to 2.784,
P,0.001), indicating that patients with an ICD had a significantly
higher 2-year survival rate than those without ICD therapy.

Figure 4 shows the results of the meta-analysis of OS with one
study removed in turn. The results indicate that the direction and
magnitude of the combined estimates did not have a large
variation. This finding indicates that the results of the meta￾analysis exhibits good reliability.
Discussion
The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the use of ICD in
patients with ESRD is associated with an increase in the OS and
the 2-year survival rate.
Data from prospective, randomized studies examining the effect
of ICD therapy in patients with CKD/ESRD are lacking, and thus
there is no general consensus on the use of device therapy in these
patients. An ongoing trial (ICD2 trail) is randomizing dialysis
patients, regardless of left ventricular function, to receive ICD
therapy or not; however, study results are not expected until 2017
[25]. Most small retrospective studies have failed to show that
patients with CKD or ESRD derive any survival benefit from ICD
implantation [9,11–14]. A subgroup analysis of data from the
MADIT-II study showed a survival benefit of ICD implantation in
patients with an eGFR .35 mL/min, but not in those in which
the eGFR was #35 mL/min [9,10]. Studies have reported a 1-
year survival of patients with CKD with ICD implantation of 61%
[12] and median survival of 6.3 years [14], and a median survival
of ESRD patients with an ICD of 1.1 to 3.2 years [12,13].
Three studies were included in this meta-analysis. Herzog et al.
[24] examined dialysis patients hospitalized from 1996 to 2001 for
ventricular fibrillation/cardiac arrest who received ICD implan￾tation within 30 day of admission. In the cohort, there were 460
patients (7.6%) who received ICD implantation and 5,582 (92.4%)
that did not. The estimated 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates
in the ICD group were 71%, 53%, 36%, 25%, and 22%,
respectively, and in the no-ICD group were 49%, 33%, 23%,
16%, and 12% (P,0.0001). Analysis of the data showed that ICD
implantation was independently associated with a 42% reduction
in the risk of death (relative risk [RR] = 0.58). The authors
concluded that in addition to the improvement in survival, ICD
therapy was underutilized in this population. Khan et al. [23]
studied 78 patients with moderate to severe CKD (45 patients with
ESRD) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) #35%, of
whom 32 had an ICD, for an average follow-up of 2.762.3 years.
In the group receiving dialysis (n = 45), ICD placement did not
impact survival. In the patients with CKD who were not receiving
dialysis (n = 33), survival was significantly better in patients with an
ICD (2-year survival 80% vs. 54%, P = 0.027) after adjustment for
sex, race, GFR, digoxin use, and presence of coronary disease,
heart failure, or hypertension (OR = 0.23). Hiremath et al. [22]
compared the outcomes of 50 patients with ESRD who had
received ICD implantation with 50 patients with ESRD who did
not have ICDs. The mean LVEF was similar between the 2 groups
(approximately 29%). Median OS in the full cohort was 4.7 years
with 20 deaths in the ICD group and 29 deaths in the no-ICD
group. The median survival in the ICD group was 8.0 years, and
3.1 years in the no-ICD group. The multivariable analysis
indicated that all-cause mortality was significantly less in the
ICD group than in the no-ICD group (HR = 0.40).
The benefits of ICDs have been shown to be reduced in patients
with advanced renal disease [9,10,26]. Furthermore, the compli￾cation rate of ICD implantation is higher in patients with ESRD
than in patients without ESRD [27-29]. Patients with CKD have
increased mortality from non-cardiac causes, cardiac non-SCD,
SCD, and infections and while ICD implantation may decrease
the risk of SCD it will not affect the risk of death from non-cardiac

causes such as infection, and there is increased risk of complica￾tions from device placement. The risk of SCD increases as renal
function deteriorates, and this increase in risk is multifactorial in
origin. The incidences of coronary artery disease, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and left ventricular dysfunction are all increased in
patients with ESRD. In addition, dialysis can lead to the
development of interstitial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and
atheroma formation, which all can worsen the aforementioned
conditions. The above highlight the competing causes of death in
patients with CKD; conditions that are not affected by ICD
placement.
The difference in survival between patients receiving dialysis
and those not receiving dialysis as reported by Khan et al. [23]
may be because in CKD patients ventricular arrhythmias can be
terminated with ICD therapy [30]. In patients receiving dialysis,
however, comorbidities which are not affected by ICD therapy
may be present [31,32]. It has also been suggested that the
defibrillation threshold may be increased in patients with ESRD,
and thus optimal conversion of arrhythmias may not occur [33].
Despite the use of an ICD, the OS of patients with CKD is lower
as compared to patients with normal kidney function [34]. On the
other hand, CKD patients with an ICD still benefit from improved
survival with ICD placement. For example, Amin et al. [35]
showed in patients with stage 1 and 2 CKD, ICD implantation
reduces mortality; however, in more advanced stages of CKD the
benefit is less significant and age dependent. The authors attribute
this finding to the fact that patients with more advanced CKD
having a higher procedural risk and decreased life expectancy.
When average procedural mortality was taken into account, the
authors found that ICD implantation is favored at ,80 years of
age for stage 3 CKD, at ,75 years of age for stage 4 CKD, and at
,65 years of age for ESRD.
ICD therapy appears to be underutilized in patients with CKD,
although patients with ESRD are at high risk for ventricular
arrhythmias and SCD. Herzog et al. [24] reported a 42%
reduction in overall death risk in dialysis patients, yet only 8% of
eligible patients received an ICD. Other data [1] and studies [36]
have also indicated that the use of ICD therapy in patients with
CKD and ESRD is low. Therapies such as aspirin, beta blockers,
and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are used less
frequently in patients with more severe renal failure [37], and
thus physicians may be less likely to use other therapies (i.e., ICD)
as well. There is also the concern of increased complications of
ICDs in patients with renal failure [17]. Finally, as previously
discussed; there is lack of data from well-designed clinical studies
for this group of patients. Interestingly, the 2013 American College
of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) guidelines for the use of
implantable ICDs and CRT include patients with CKD and
ESRD [38].
The primary limitation of this meta-analysis is the small number
of included studies. However, the inclusion criteria were strict by
design to include only studies that were high quality and relevant
to addressing the research question. In addition, only patients with
ESRD were included. It remains to be determined if the results are
also applicable to patients with CKD, but not ESRD.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis indicate that the
use of an ICD in patients with ESRD is associated with an increase
in the OS and the 2-year survival rate. Based on these results, the
use of ICD therapy in these patients is warranted.
