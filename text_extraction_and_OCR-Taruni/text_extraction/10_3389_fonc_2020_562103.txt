Background and Aim: Although liver transplantation (LT) is one of the most effective
treatments for the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the high-risk patients
suffer from a high ratio of tumor recurrence after LT. Lenvatinib, as a novel targeted drug,
has shown an excellent effect in the treatment of advanced HCC, but there is no study on
its effect in preventing HCC recurrence in the patients undergoing transplantation.
Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the role of adjuvant lenvatinib in
preventing recurrence of high-risk LT recipients with HBV-related HCC.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 23 high-risk patients consisting of lenvatinib group
(n=14) and control group (n=9) with HBV-related HCC who underwent LT in our center.
Disease-free survival (DFS) and HCC recurrence of the two groups were compared. The
adverse events (AEs) and drug tolerance of lenvatinib were evaluated.
Results: The median DFS in lenvatinib group was 291 (95%CI 204–516) days,
significantly longer than 182 (95%CI 56–537) days in control group (P=0.04). Three
patients in lenvatinib group (21.4%) and five patients in control group (55.6%) had short￾term HCC recurrence (P=0.11). All patients in lenvatinib group could tolerate oral lenvatinib
for at least three cycles except six cases (42.9%) of dose reduction and 1 case of
interruption (14.3%). Thirteen patients (92.9%) taking lenvatinib experienced AEs. The
most common AEs were hypertension (64.3%) and proteinuria (42.9%), and the most
serious AEs were Grade 3 for 4 cases (28.5%) according to common terminology criteria
for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Additionally, no influence of lenvatinib on the
dosage and blood concentration of FK506 was observed.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 80% of
all primary liver cancer, which is the sixth most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide in 2018, with about 841,000 new cases and
782,000 deaths annually (1). In China, it is the third most
common malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of 12.1%, the
second lowest in all invasive cancers (2). Since liver
transplantation (LT) was introduced as an unprecedented and
potentially curative operation for unresectable hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the number of LT candidates with HCC as
primary indication has grown continuously worldwide,
representing up to 50% of the indications in most transplant
centers (3).
Although LT is the only treatment that offers the real chance
to eradicate both HCC and the underlying liver cirrhosis,
recurrence of HCC remains unavoidable and is one of the
main causes of death after LT (4). Milan criteria (MC) has
been the most widely used indication criteria for LT candidates
with HCC, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free
survival (DFS) rate of patients meeting MC after transplantation
is about 70% and 60% (5, 6). Because Milan criteria was so strict
to deprives the transplantation opportunities of some HCC
patients who might have benefited from LT, some other
criteria, such as UCSF criteria, Pittsburgh criteria, Tokyo
criteria, and Hangzhou criteria, has been proposed and
expanded the indication of LT for HCC in varying degrees (7–
9). Unfortunately, 5-year oval survival rate and recurrence-free
survival rate falls to approximately 50% and 35% respectively in
patients with advanced HCC who receive liver transplants under
extended criteria and who can be considered to be at high-risk of
HCC recurrence after transplantation (6, 10, 11). A strategy for
prolonging both DFS and OS in such high-risk patients with
HCC is a challenging but critical issue. In order to reduce HCC
recurrence after LT, some randomized studies attempting to use
chemotherapeutic drugs as adjuvant therapy after LT has
suggested no obvious benefit for HCC patients (12). In last
decade, several studies in which sorafenib was taken as
adjuvant therapy following LT of high-risk HCC candidates
just demonstrated a potential effect on reducing recurrence (5,
13, 14). Therefore, there is still no clear consensus on the
adjuvant therapy after LT for preventing HCC recurrence.
Recently, lenvatinib, a novel molecule-targeted drug behaving
as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
receptors, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, platelet￾derived growth factor (PDFG) receptor alpha and KIT and
RET proto-oncogenes, completed the phase II clinical trial and
a randomized phase 3 non-inferiority trial (REFLECT trial) in
which lenvatinib showed non-inferior to sorafenib in overall
survival, as well as statistically significant improvement in
progression-free survival, time to progression, and objective
response rate (ORR) with safety (15–17). Interestingly,
subgroup analysis revealed that the OS of HBV-related HCC
patients treated with lenvatinib was significantly longer than that
of the sorafenib group, which suggested that lenvatinib may be
more effective for hepatitis B-related HCC. Hereupon, lenvatinib
was recommended as a first-line drug for unresectable HCC in
several clinical practice guidelines, including National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society
for Medical Oncology (ESMO), American Association for the
Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), European Association for the
Study of the Liver (EASL) and Chinese Society of Clinical
Oncology (CSCO) (18–20). To date, there were few reports on
application of lenvatinib in LT recipients with HCC, especially
no report of using LEN as adjuvant therapy for preventing HCC
recurrence after LT. Therefore, a retrospective case control study
(NCT04415567) was conducted by reviewing 23 high-risk HCC
patients after LT in our department, 14 of whom taking
lenvatinib as adjuvant therapy after LT, and aimed to evaluate
the safety and effect of adjuvant therapy using lenvatinib in
these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed 23 Chinese HCC patients with HBV
infection, who underwent LT in our hospital from June 2018 to
December 2019. All donor grafts were allocated by the China
Organ Transplant Response System. All these patients were
diagnosed by histology and were defined as “high-risk” for
recurrence according to the following criteria: (1) beyond
Milan criteria confirmed either by radiology before LT or by
pathology after LT, (2) tumor with intrahepatic vascular
invasion, (3) Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)≥400 ng/L before LT, (4)
presence of microvascular invasion (MVI), (5) tumor with
histological poor differentiation according to Edmondson￾Steiner classification system (21), (6) multiple satellite lesions
around the largest tumors detected either by radiology before LT
or by histology after LT, (7) tumor penetrating hepatic capsule,
(8) recurrent HCC after resection.
Patients were divided into lenvatinib group and control group
according to their willingness to take lenvatinib as adjuvant
therapy after LT. Of the 23 patients, 14 patients in lenvatinib
group began to take lenvatinib about a month after LT except for
routine treatment, while the other nine patients in control group
received routine treatment and follow-up after transplantation.

Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 562103

Clinical data and demographic characteristics was obtained,
including age, sex, underlying liver disease, presence of pre￾transplant treatments, LT-related information and tumor
pathology. This study was conducted according to the 1975
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Ethics Committee of
Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University
School of Medicine (No. XHEC-D-2020-068). All patients
enrolled in this study provided informed consent.
Usage of Lenvatinib
and Immunosuppressants
The patients in lenvatinib group received oral lenvatinib (Eisai,
Japan) 12 mg/day (for bodyweight (BW) ≥60 kg) or 8 mg/day
(for BW <60 kg) in 28-day cycles until HCC recurrence or
serious adverse events (SAEs) or voluntary withdrawal. Dose
interruptions followed by reductions for lenvatinib-related
toxicities (to 8 mg and 4 mg/day, or 4 mg every other day)
were permitted. All 14 patients took lenvatinib for more than
three cycles.
The induction immunosuppression strategies for all patients
enrolled in the study involved IV infusion of 20 mg of basiliximab
within 2 h prior to operation and a second dose 4 days later, oral
tacrolimus started on the fourth day after LT at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg
(BW) and adjusted according to its plasma concentration, taking
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) from the next day after surgery at a
dose of 500 mg/kg (BW), and rapid withdrawal of glucocorticoids
with the initial dose of 500 mg. Maintenance immunosuppression
which was started about one month after LT included sirolimus (4
mg/M2 per day) plus oral tacrolimus with the plasma concentration
maintained at 5–8 ng/ml.
Following Up and Clinical Assessment
All patients were followed up monthly within six months after
LT and every three months within two years. During each follow￾up, complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, serum AFP
level, liver and kidney function test, and blood concentration
of FK506 were recorded. Chest and abdominal computed
tomography was implemented at 3 months, 6 months,
12 months, and annually thereafter. Other radiological
examinations such as radionuclide bone scan, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography
(PET) were obtained when local recurrence or distant metastasis
was suspected. HCC recurrence was diagnosed by the definite
tumor lesions found in radiology.
The DFS was defined as the period between the day of LT and
the day of HCC recurrence and metastasis confirmed by imaging,
while the OS was defined as the duration from LT to death of
patients for any reason or to end of follow-up. Common
terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 (CTCAE V5.0)
was used to assess the AE during oral administration of lenvatinib.
The FK506 dosage and blood concentration of each patients in the
first six months after liver LT was recorded for evaluate the
influence of lenvatinib on the immunosuppressive therapy.
Statistical Analysis
Mean and standard deviations were used for descriptive
statistics. The patient characteristics in each group were
compared by one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests. Repeated
measures analysis of variances was used for comparing the
difference of FK506 dosage and blood concentration between
two groups. The OS and DFS were statistically analyzed by the
Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
Version 10.0.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
and
Clinical Data
The comparison of demographic characteristics and clinical data
between two groups was shown in Table 1, in which we
concluded that there was no significant difference in baseline
data between the two groups. The median follow up was 468 days
(95%CI 258–616) in lenvatinib group and 445 days (95%CI 180–
673) in control group (c2 = 0.977, P=0.324). In lenvatinib group,
all patients took for more than 3 months, with a shortest
medication time of 90 days and a longest time of 512 days.
Two patients withdrew the administration of lenvatinib due to
HCC recurrence, three patients stop taking the drug for AEs of
grade 3, and the other 3 patients stop lenvatinib treatment for
cost. Five patients have been taking lenvatinib orally
without recurrence.
Effect of Lenvatinib
The efficacy of lenvatinib was shown in Table 2. Figure 1 depicts
the DFS of our cohorts. All patients are alive at present till the
end of the study, so the median OS of patients in our cohorts was
468 days (95%CI 258–616) in lenvatinib group and 445 days
(95% CI 180–673) in control group, the same with follow-up
(c2 = 0.977, P=0.324). The median DFS in lenvatinib group was
291 (95% CI 204–516) days, compared with 182 (95%CI 56–537)
days in control group. There was significant difference between
two groups by the Kaplan-Meier method (c2 = 4.208, P=0.041).
Three patients in lenvatinib group (21.4%) and five patients in
control group (55.6%) had short-term HCC recurrence, but no
significant difference was found between two groups (c2 = 2.813,
P=0.11). In both groups, pulmonary recurrence was the most
common site of recurrence, which involved in 2 cases (14.3%) in
lenvatinib group and 3 cases (33.3%) in control group. One
patient in lenvatinib group had multiple recurrences in lung and
left adrenal gland, while one patient in control group suffered
from multiple recurrence in lung and sacral bone. By repeated
measures analysis, no significant difference was observed in the
AFP level during the first year after LT between two groups
(F=1.996, P=0.175) (Figure 2).
Adverse Events of Lenvatinib
All patients in lenvatinib group could tolerate the oral lenvatinib
for at least three cycles, but six of them (42.9%) underwent dose
reduction due to AEs of Grade 2 and another patient (14.3%)
experienced one-week drug interruption followed by dose

reduction because of nasal bleeding. However, AEs of grade 3 led
to lenvatinib withdraw in three patients (21.4%). Table 3 lists the
adverse events during lenvatinib administration and the
corresponding CTCAE grade. Total incidence of AEs was
92.9% (13/14). The most common AEs were hypertension
(64.3%) and proteinuria (42.9%). No fatal AE happened and
the most serious AEs were four cases of CTCAE Grade 3,
including hypertension, drug-induced liver injury (DILI),
fatigue and nasal bleeding.
Influence of Lenvatinib
on Immunosuppressant
There was no significant difference in dosage of FK506 during
the first six months after LT between two groups (F=0.167,
P=0.688), as well as the blood concentration (F=2.439, P=0.139).
Figure 3 shows the dosage and blood concentration of FK506 in
both groups, with no difference in monthly results.
DISCUSSION
HCC is one of the most common cancers worldwide with the
incidence rising over the last 20 years (22). Since the Milan
criteria has been widely accepted, LT has gradually become a
superior way to LR or other locoregional treatments for HCC
patients who met the criteria, because it enabled the widest
possible resection margins and completely removes the diseased
liver at risk of developing HCC (23). However, the debate
regarding the feasibility of transplantation for patients beyond
the Milan criteria has not been resolved thus far, since the
recurrence rate was reported rising in varying degrees (6, 10,
11). However, LT remains the only possible curative treatment
for these patients who was considered to be at high risk of
recurrence after transplantation.
In addition, some other factors have been identified as high
risk factors for HCC recurrence after transplantation. It was

widely proved that macrovascular and microvascular invasion,
high AFP level before LT, as well as poor tumor differentiation
are the most important factors affecting HCC recurrence (6, 24).
AFP and tumor differentiation as an important index were
involved in Hangzhou standard, as well as the latest AFP
model and Up-to-Seven criteria Metroticket V2.0 (9, 25).
Besides, some other researchers proposed that MVI is also one
of the important factors influencing HCC recurrence after LT
through Cox regression analysis (4, 26). Li et al. demonstrated in
their study that exceeding Milan criteria, macrovascular
invasion, liver capsule invasion and satellite lesions were
significant different between the patients with and without
HCC recurrence after LT by univariate analysis, implying they
were high risk factors for HCC recurrence (27). Based on these
reports and the experience in our center, we adopted the above￾mentioned high-risk factors for recurrence in our study.
Before lenvatinib, sorafenib was the first and only one
molecule-targeted drug approved for HCC treatment, so
several studies have been carried out to evaluate the effect of
sorafenib on preventing from the HCC recurrence of patients
after LT. A retrospective study from Satapathy and his colleagues
showed that preemptive treatment with sorafenib in OLT
recipients with high-risk features in explant did not improve
HCC recurrence-free or overall survival (28). Shetty et al.
demonstrated decreased overall rate of HCC recurrence rate
and prolonged 1-year disease free survival of patients by adjuvant
sorafenib after LT, concluding that adjuvant use of sorafenib
could decreases risk of HCC recurrence in high-risk LT
recipients (29). In a multicenter phase I trial of adjuvant
sorafenib in 14 LT recipients with high-risk HCC, one patient
(7.1%) died and four (28.5%) recurred over a median follow-up
of 953 days, implying a potentially promising effect of post￾transplant sorafenib on recurrence-free survival (5). Another
study demonstrated the safety and potential benefit of sorafenib
in reducing the incidence of HCC recurrence and in extending
disease-free and overall survival for high-risk liver transplant
recipients (13). In a case control study, the disease-free survival
at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months and the overall survival
rate at 24 months for patients with adjuvant sorafenib were
increased significantly (14). Accordingly, there is no certain
conclusion about the adjuvant use of sorafenib in patients with
high-risk HCC after transplantation.
Lenvatinib is a novel oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets
VEGF receptors 1–3, FGF receptors 1–4, PDGF receptor a, RET,
and KIT. In 2018, lenvatinib was proved to be non-inferior to
sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced HCC in the
randomized phase III trial, in which the patients with HBV￾related HCC in lenvatinib group had a superior PFS and OS to
the patients in sorafenib group (15). Therefore, we conducted
this retrospective study. As far as we know, this is the first report
to describe the potential role of lenvatinib as adjuvant therapy in
reducing HCC recurrence after liver transplant for high￾risk patients.
Since lenvatinib was just approved for HCC treatment in
March, 2018 in Japan, which is the first country in the world
approving lenvatinib for HCC treatment and a number of studies
revealed that postoperative recurrence of HCC often occurred in
early stage after LT (14), this study involved twenty-three high￾risk HCC patients who underwent LT in recent two years.
Although lenvatinib only being SFDA-approved for advanced
HCC in September 2018, before that, two patients who took
lenvatinib purchased the drugs from abroad themselves and one
of them relapsed after administration of lenvatinib for 7 months.
Within our cohorts, there was a significant longer DFS in
lenvatinib group, which inferred a certain benefit of adjuvant
lenvatinib on prolonging the DFS of HBV-related high-risk HCC
patients after LT. Although no significant statistical difference
was observed in recurrence rate between two groups, this study
provides initial but important evidence that adjuvant lenvatinib
FIGURE 2 | Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of the patients after liver

repeated measures analysis (P=0.175), but the value of log10AFP in lenvatinib
group was significantly lower than that in control group in the second month
after liver transplantation (LT) (P=0.04) *: P < 0.05.
FIGURE 1 | Disease-free survival (DFS) of two groups. Patients in lenvatinib
group had better DFS than those in control group (P = 0.04).

could be effective for decreasing HCC recurrence of high-risk
patients following transplantation. We found extrahepatic
recurrences, especially in the lung, were the more common in
early postoperative days, which was observed in the former study
(27). In lenvatinib group, one of three recurrent patients who
experienced intrahepatic multiple recurrence received TACE and
replacement of anlotinib, another target drug. Another patient
with lung metastasis had pulmonary surgery and anlotinib
instead as well. The third patient suffering from multiple
recurrences continued to oral lenvatinib without dose change
and lived for 14 months after recurrence. In control group, four
recurrent patients started oral lenvatinib when diagnosis of HCC
recurrence except for one patient who was found HCC
metastasis in his left adrenal gland underwent resection of left
adrenal gland. All patients in both groups survival so far,
resulting in no significant difference in OS. To sum up the
efficacy, adjuvant lenvatinib had a potential role in increasing
the DFS and decreasing the recurrence rate for high-risk HBV￾related HCC patients following LT. Moreover, no obvious effect
of adjuvant lenvatinib on serum AFP level in the patients with
high-risk HCC after liver transplantation was found in the study.
In terms of lenvatinib safety, total incidence of AEs in our
study was 92.9% (13/14), similar with the previous trials, as all 46
patients experienced at least one AE in phase II trial and 94%of
subjects had varying degrees of AEs (15, 17). However, in our
cohorts, the incidence of Grade 3 AEs was 28.5% (4/14) with no
AEs beyond Grade 3, obviously lower than the rate of 48% in
phase II trial and 57% in phase III trial (15, 17). This may be
resulted from the small number of cases in this study, the better
basic physical condition of the patients who could went through
LT, and the elimination of the patients’ underlying liver diseases
by LT. Besides, in both of this study and previous trials, the most
common AE was hypertension with similar incidence (64.3% vs
76.1% vs 42%). In our cohorts, treatment-related AEs led to
lenvatinib drug interruption in one patient (7.1%), dose
reduction in 6 patients (42.9%), and drug withdrawal in 3
patients (21.4%), lower than those in phase III trial. It inferred
that patients after LT might behave a superior tolerance
to lenvatinib.
As a special group, the interaction between any additional
medication and the immunosuppressants should be considered
for the LT recipients, so the dose and blood concentration
change of FK506 was detected in the study to evaluate whether
lenvatinib would influence the FK506 usage. Since the patients in
lenvatinib group began lenvatinib administration about 1 month
after surgery, we compared the dose and blood concentration of
FK506 during the first six months after LT between the two
groups, founding no significant difference. The results suggested
no obvious influence of lenvatinib on the use of CNI
immunosuppressants of the LT recipients.
In conclusion, this preliminary study demonstrates a
potential benefit of adjuvant lenvatinib on prolonging the
disease-free survival and reducing the recurrence of high-risk
patients with HBV-related HCC following liver transplantation
with an acceptable drug safety and patient tolerance. Limitations
of this study include its retrospective analysis, and only one
center experience, small number of patients involved as a result
of strict selection criteria. Therefore, a prospective and
randomized study with large sample should be encouraged.
