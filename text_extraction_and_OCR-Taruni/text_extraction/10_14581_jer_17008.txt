Background and Purpose: In the present study, we reviewed the outcome of ketogenic diet (KD) use for the 
management of epilepsy in children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
Methods: A total of 12 children with intractable epilepsy associated with TSC who were treated with KD at 
our hospital between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2015 were retrospectively enrolled. 
Results: The mean age at the time of KD initiation was 73.1 ± 38.0 months. Patients were medically 
refractory to a mean of 4.8 ± 1.7 antiepileptic drugs. Nine patients (75.0%) had a history of infantile spasms. 
At 3 months after KD initiation, 10 patients (83.3%) had > 50% seizure reduction. Moreover, 7 patients 
(58.3%) exhibited qualitative improvements in cognition and behavior after KD initiation, as reported by 
caregivers/parents. The mean duration of dietary therapy was 14.8 ± 12.8 months. Half of the patients in this 
study eventually underwent epilepsy surgery due to persistent seizures or seizure relapse.
Conclusion: KD is an important non-pharmacological treatment option for patients with intractable epilepsy 
associated with TSC. KD may improve cognition and behavior in addition to reducing seizure frequency.

Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited multisystem dis￾order that is typically caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, affecting 
1 in every 6,000 or 10,000 persons, respectively.1-3 TSC is charac￾terized by pleomorphic features involving several organ systems and 
hallmark central nervous system (CNS) findings including cortical tu￾bers, subependymal nodules (SEN), and subependymal giant cell as￾trocytoma (SEGA).1,2,4,5 Neurologic involvement in TSC is associated 
with disease-related disability such as epilepsy, behavioral disorders, 
and cognitive deficits,4‐8
 with epilepsy being the most common, re￾ported in 75% to 90% of patients.6,9 Moreover, 30% to 50% of pa￾tients with TSC are diagnosed with infantile spasms (IS), an epileptic 
encephalopathy syndrome, in their 1st year of life.10‐13 TSC-asso￾ciated neuropsychiatric disorder is another major pathological fea￾ture in patients, which affects clinical outcome as well as quality of 
life.5,7
Several treatment options are available to optimize neuro￾developmental function and manage epilepsy in patients with TSC, 
including anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), ketogenic diet (KD), epilepsy 
surgery (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), vagus nerve stim￾ulation, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor 
therapy.6,9,12,14,15 In this study, we reviewed use of a KD in children 
with TSC and drug-resistant epilepsy and evaluated its effects on 
seizure burden and cognitive as well as behavioral outcomes.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients seen for 
TSC at the pediatric neurology department of Severance Children’s 
Hospital between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2015. Patients 
were included if they had clinically definite TSC, had been on a KD for 
> 3 months, had seizures intractable to at least 2 AEDs, and were 
available for formal neuropsychological (NP) evaluation and parental

global assessment for diet outcome. We excluded patients who had 
been on the low glycemic index diet, those with poor compliance for 
KD maintenance < 3 months, and those whose parents had difficulty 
counting seizures to determine seizure frequency. Finally, 12 patients 
were enrolled.
A KD (3:1 or 4:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein) or a 
modified Atkin’s diet was started without fasting. Patient data in￾cluding gender, age at last follow up, brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) findings, age at seizure onset, number of AEDs used, 
history of infantile spasms, developmental status, epilepsy classi￾fication at KD initiation, age at KD initiation, lead-time to KD ini￾tiation, peak effect of KD, duration of KD, seizure outcome after KD, 
and parental global assessment of overall KD outcome were col￾lected by chart review. Minor adjustments of AEDs were done during 
KD maintenance in some cases. Seizure outcomes were assessed at 3 
months, 6 months, and 12 months after starting the KD, and were 
classified as follows: seizure free, > 90% reduction, 50% to 90% re￾duction, and < 50% reduction in seizures. The parental global as￾sessment of overall KD outcome regarded the patient’s overall con￾dition, including seizure burden as well as cognitive and behavioral 
features. Parental assessments were obtained at clinic visits, and 
were classified as much improved, somewhat improved, no interval 
change, and worsened.
NP evaluations were available in all 12 patients. As per formal NP 
evaluations, patients with an intelligence quotient (IQ) < 70 (or 
sometimes a Developmental quotient [DQ] or social quotient [SQ] in 
cases where an IQ was not obtained) were considered to be cogni￾tively impaired.
The institutional review board of the Severance Hospital approved 
this study.
Results
Patient demographic and clinical characteristics
Of 156 children with TSC who were seen at our hospital during the 
study period, 133 (85.3%) were treated for epilepsy with multiple 
treatment modalities such as AEDs, KD, and surgery. KD was initiated 
in 18 patients. 6 patients were excluded due to loss to follow up or 
early discontinuation of the KD within 3 months. Ultimately, 12 of 
these patients were included in our analysis.
The 12 patients enrolled in this study were 5 boys and 7 girls with 
a mean age of 73.1 ± 38.0 months (range, 26.4-144.2 months). All 
12 patients of had cortical tubers and SEN, and 3 patients (25.0%) 
had SEGA on brain MRI. Ten patients (83.3%) had experienced seiz￾ures in the 1st year of life and the mean age at seizure onset was 9.6 
± 12.5 months (range, 1.0-47.4 months). Patients were treated with 
a mean of 4.8 ± 1.7 AEDs (range, 2-7) for seizure control. Nine pa￾tients (75.0%) had a history of IS and all of them (9 patients with IS) 
failed to control spasms with vigabatrin, which is an effective in the 
treatment of TSC children with IS. Upon KD initiation, 6 patients 
(50%) had IS, 1 patient had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and 5 
(41.7%) patients had focal epilepsy. The mean age at KD initiation 
was 23.2 ± 21.7 months (range, 2.9-76.5 months) and the lead-time 
to KD initiation (i.e., the time interval from seizure onset to KD ini￾tiation) was 13.7 ± 13.5 months (range, 1.5-38.0 months). The 
mean duration of KD maintenance was 14.8 ± 12.8 months (range,

3.3-43.6 months). Seven patients (58.3%) had cognitive impairment 
at the time of KD initiation (Table 1, 2).
Seizure outcomes
After 3 months of the KD, 4 patients (33.3%) were seizure free 
and 10 patients (83.3%) achieved a > 50% reduction in seizures. 
Two patients discontinued the KD after 3 months due to seizure 
aggravation. Among 10 patients who continued the KD for 6 months, 
6 (60.0%) were seizure free and 8 (80%) achieved a > 50% reduc￾tion in seizures. Reasons for KD discontinuation after 6 months were 
limited effectiveness in 2 patients (50.0%), general weakness and 
weight loss in 1 patient (25.0%), and parental will in 1 patient 
(25.0%). Half of the initial 12 patients maintained the dietary ther￾apy for more than 12 months. Of these, 2 (33.3%) were seizure free, 
2 achieved a 90% reduction in seizures, and 2 had a < 50% reduc￾tion in seizures after 12 months of the KD (Table 2, 3).
Of the 12 patients included in our analysis, 6 patients underwent 
epilepsy surgery after trying the KD; 3 of these patients (50.0%) ex￾perienced no effect on KD, 2 of them (33.3%) were seizure free with 
KD for initial several months, but recurred, and 1 of them (16.7%) 
had only partial effect by KD (75% reduction of seizure frequency for 
less than 3 months). 5 of above mentioned 6 patients (83.3%) were 
seizure free after surgery and 1 patient still experienced weekly 
seizures. Therefore, 8 of the 12 original patients included in our anal￾ysis achieved seizure free status at last follow up; 1 (12.5%) was 
seizure free with KD maintenance, 5 (62.5%) were seizure free after 
surgery, and 2 (25.0%) were seizure free after finding an appropriate 
AED regimen, even after KD discontinuation.
Cognitive and behavioral features
Efficacy of the KD was mainly assessed by seizure outcome; 
however, the global outcome by parental assessment included 
cognitive and behavioral features in addition to seizure burden. 
Four patients (33.3%) were “much improved,” 5 patients (41.7%) 
were “somewhat improved,” 2 patients (16.7%) showed “no in-

terval change,” and 1 patient was (8.3%) “worsened” after 3 
months of the KD (Fig. 1).
Discussion
The present results suggest that KD maintenance is useful for the 
management of intractable seizures in patients with TSC. KD main￾tenance not only had beneficial effects on seizure frequency, but also 
produced overall improvements in cognition or behavior as rated by 
patient’s caretakers/parents. One-third of patients were seizure free 
and 83.3% patients showed a > 50% reduction in seizure frequency 
after 3 months of the KD. After 12 months of the KD, 4 of 6 patients 
(66.7%) achieved a > 50% reduction in seizures. Furthermore, 
75.0% patients who maintained the KD for at least 3 months were 
reported to have overall improvement (much or somewhat improved) 
as per parental assessments. Given that cognitive and behavioral 
problems are main features of CNS involvement in TSC,5,8,16 and that 
58.3% of patients had cognitive impairment defined by an IQ, SQ, or 
DQ of < 70 prior to dietary therapy in our study, it is possible that the 
KD has multifaceted utility for addressing CNS symptoms in TSC. 
Few previous studies have reported the efficacy of a KD for the 
treatment of epilepsy associated with TSC.17,18 Our finding of a 50% 
to 90% reduction in seizure frequency at 6 months after diet ini￾tiation is consistent with that a previous study by Kossoff et al.17
Another study indicated that low glycemic index dietary therapy also 
produced good responses with minimal side effects in patients with 
epilepsy related to TSC.19
Patients with TSC are at high risk for early-onset seizures including 
focal seizures and IS.9
 Approximately 30% of infants with TSC pres￾ent with epileptic encephalopathy, which has a poor prognosis.6
 In 
our study, 83.3% patients developed seizures in the 1st year of life 
and 75.0% of patients had a history of IS. Indeed, half of our study 
population started KD to treat IS. Future studies should examine 
whether the KD has particular usefulness in a subset of patients with 
a history of IS or active IS.
Neuropsychological deficits of TSC are associated with abnormal￾ities in the mTOR signaling pathway, which has a crucial role in brain 
development. Previous studies have identified the ability of a KD to 
decrease mTOR activation in animal models, providing a biological 
basis for the mechanism of action for dietary treatment.3,20 Yet, the 
exact mechanism of KD-mediated benefits in TSC remains unknown 
and warrants further research. 
This study had several limitations. First, we enrolled a small num￾ber of patients and lacked precise data about seizure types, electro￾encephalogram findings, and genetic studies. Second, considering 
the retrospective nature of the study, data may have been incomplete 
despite our efforts to be thorough in chart/record collection and 
review.
In conclusion, KD therapy is an important treatment option in cas￾es of medically intractable epilepsy related to TSC. Considering the 
efficacy of the KD for seizure reduction and neuropsychological im￾provement in our study, additional studies should explore the ther￾apeutic value and mechanism of a KD in TSC.
