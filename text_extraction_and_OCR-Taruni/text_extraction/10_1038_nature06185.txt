Abstract
It is becoming increasingly clear that the autonomic nervous system
and the immune system demonstrate cross-talk during inflammation
by means of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways1,2. We


investigated whether phagocytes are capable of de novo production
of catecholamines, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine self-
regulatory mechanism by catecholamines during inflammation, as
has been described for lymphocytes3. Here we show that exposure
of phagocytes to lipopolysaccharide led to a release of
catecholamines and an induction of catecholamine-generating and
degrading enzymes, indicating the presence of the complete
intracellular machinery for the generation, release and inactivation
of catecholamines. To assess the importance of these findings in
vivo, we chose two models of acute lung injury. Blockade of α2-
adrenoreceptors or catecholamine-generating enzymes greatly
suppressed lung inflammation, whereas the opposite was the case
either for an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist or for inhibition of
catecholamine-degrading enzymes. We were able to exclude T cells
or sympathetic nerve endings as sources of the injury-modulating
catecholamines. Our studies identify phagocytes as a new source of
catecholamines, which enhance the inflammatory response.

Editorial Summary
Adrenergic inflammation


The discovery that phagocytic blood cells (macrophages and
neutrophils) are a significant source of catecholamines
(noradrenaline and adrenaline), and can cause reinforcement of the
acute inflammatory response, comes as a surprise. The body's
inflammatory response to traumatic injury or infection is designed
to protect it and return it to the preinjury state, but excessive
inflammatory responses can seriously injure tissues and organs.
Experiments in rat and mouse models of acute lung injury show that
phagocytes act as virtually a third component of the adrenergic
system — joining the adrenal medulla in the brain, and synaptic
neurons. The findings raise the possibility that unwanted
inflammatory responses (as seen in atherosclerosis, acute cardiac
ischaemic injury and acute lung injury) might be suppressed in
humans by adrenoreceptor blockade.
