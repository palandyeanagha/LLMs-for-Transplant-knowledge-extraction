Abstract
The protein encoded by the p53 tumour
suppressor gene plays an important part
in the regulation of cell growth. Abnor￾malities of this gene represent one of the
most common genetic changes in the
development of human cancers. This
study investigated the expression of p53
protein in cholangiocarcinoma arising
in association with primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC). Of the 14 patients
with cholangiocarcinoma studied, 13 had
underlying PSC. The expression of p53
protein was detected immunohisto￾chemically in paraffin wax embedded
liver specimens, after microwave pre￾treatment. The expression of p53 protein
was shown in the cholangiocarcinoma tis￾sue of 11 of 14 (78/5%) patients. In five of
10 patients, the accumulation of p53 pro￾tein highlighted the presence of neoplastic
cells in biliary tissue separate from the
main tumour. These cells were mainly
located in the septal bile ducts or in the
accessory glands, or both, but occasion￾ally also in large portal areas at the
periphery of nerves and lymphatics, and
in one case in the mucosa of an extra￾hepatic bile duct. No p53 protein was
detectable in liver tissue obtained at the
time of transplantation in 15 patients with
PSC but not cholangiocarcinoma. These
results show that cholangiocarcinoma
development in PSC is commonly associ￾ated with abnormalities of p53 and that
these occur at a late stage in the develop￾ment of the malignant process. Staining
for p53 protein could represent an addi￾tional criterion for the diagnosis of
cholangiocarcinoma development in
patients with PSC.

Inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor
gene is a frequent step in the development of
human cancer.' Two essential functions of the
protein encoded by this gene are now recog￾nised: to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase,
permitting the cells exposed to mutagenic fac￾tors to repair their DNA, or to induce apopto￾sis, programmed cell death.2 Mutations in the
p53 gene may block these normal functions
and result in prolonged survival of cells carry￾ing DNA mutations. Mutations in the gene
lead to a synthesis of an abnormal p53 protein,
which has a longer half life and accumulates in
cell nuclei. The half life of this mutated protein
(between four to eight hours) is longer than
that of the wild type (five to 20 minutes), per￾mitting detection by immunohistochemistry.3
Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor
gene and overexpression of p53 protein have
been described in liver tumours originating
from hepatocytes, such as hepatocellular
carcinoma4 5 and hepatoblastoma.6 A com￾paratively high incidence of p53 mutations
has also been shown recently in gall bladder
carcinoma.7 In addition, patients with the
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a condition with an
inherited germ line mutation affecting the
p53 gene, develop cholangiocarcinoma.8
Therefore, changes in the function of this gene
may participate in biliary tract carcinogenesis.
Development of cholangiocarcinoma in pri￾mary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is common,
the prevalence of the tumour varying from 7%
in asymptomatic patients to 42% of necropsy
series.9
In this study we have investigated the
expression of p53 protein in cholangiocarci￾noma and PSC.
Methods
Fourteen patients with cholangiocarcinoma
were studied, 13 of whom had underlying
PSC. Nine patients were male and five female,
median age 40 years. Ten patients underwent
orthotopic liver transplantation, and four
partial liver resection.
Non-neoplastic biliary tissue surrounding
the tumour area was available for study in the
specimens examined from 10 of 14 patients. In
one patient with PSC a specimen from an
extrahepatic bile duct was obtained by endo￾scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) biopsy. Liver tissue from 15 patients
transplanted for PSC with no evidence of
cholangiocarcinoma in the explanted liver was
also studied.
The expression of p53 protein was
compared with the serum biochemistry tests
(albumin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase),
the serum tumour markers for cholangio￾carcinoma (carcinoembryonic antigen and
carbohydrate antigen 19-9),10 and the histo￾logical classification of cholangiocarcinoma.
Detection ofp53 protein expression
Cellular expression of p53 protein was detected
in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue
specimens using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex method. Sections were deparaffinised,
rehydrated through graded alcohols, and the
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked

with 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15
minutes. The sections were transferred into
0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and
microwaved for 15-20 minutes at maximum
power using Proline microwave oven (Proline
Power Wave 700) rated at 700 W.'1 12 In pre￾liminary experiments these conditions have
been optimised and we have shown that
microwave pretreatment is an essential step for
adequate detection of p53 protein in formalin
fixed liver specimens. The sections were subse￾quently incubated with TRIS buffered saline
(TBS, 0.05 MTRIS-HCL and 0a 15 M sodium
chloride, pH 7.4) containing 10% normal
serum from the species in which the secondary,
biotinylated antibody was raised. p53 Protein
was detected with a monoclonal antibody to
p53 protein DO 1 (Cambridge Bioscience, UK)
diluted 1:100 in TBS, for 60 minutes at 37°C.
The sections were washed and then incubated
for 30 minutes with a biotinylated rabbit anti￾mouse antibody (DAKO Ltd, High Wycombe,
UK) diluted 1:400 in TBS, followed by
Streptavidin ABC (DAKO Ltd) diluted in
TBS 1:200 for 30 minutes. The peroxidase
substrate was 3',3-diaminobenzine-tetra￾hydrochloride (0.5 mg/ml) in TBS plus 0.01%
H202 and was applied to the tissue for five
minutes. The sections were then counter￾stained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted in distrene-tricresyl phosphate￾xilene. Nuclear staining for p53 protein was
defined as intense if a positive reaction was
present in more than 80% of the nuclei and
weak if less than 20% were positive. The
immunostaining was assessed by two indepen￾dent observers (PMR and BP). As positive
controls for immunodetection of mutant p53
protein we used two hepatoma cell lines
(PLC/PRF/5 and HUH-7), which have dif￾ferent mutations in the p53 gene and are known
to produce mutant p53 proteins.13 Both cell
lines were cultured under standard conditions,
the cells were trypsinised, washed, and the cell
pellets were fixed in buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin wax. The positive stain￾ing with the monoclonal DO 1 antibody was also
compared with a polyclonal rabbit antibody to
p53 protein (kindly donated by Dr H Zentgraff,
DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany), diluted 1:500,
and detected with a biotinylated goat antirabbit
antibody and Streptavidin ABC (DAKO Ltd).
The negative controls included replacement of
the primary antibody to p53 with buffer only or
a monoclonal antibody with different speci￾ficity, as well as immunostaining of normal liver
tissue with anti-p53.
Results
Accumulation of p53 protein was shown as
dense nuclear staining in the neoplastic tissue of
1 1 of 14 cholangiocarcinoma samples (78.5%).
In seven cases, the staining was intense and
present in more than 80% of the cells (Fig 1),
while in the remaining four cases it was seen in
some 20% of the nuclei. The proportion of cells
with overexpression of p53 protein did not cor￾relate with serum biochemistry and the serum
tumour markers or the histological classification
of cholangiocarcinoma (Table).

Figure 2: Dysplastic andfocally malignant epithelium

In five of 10 patients with PSC and cholan￾giocarcinoma, screening of large tissue blocks
including perihilar tissue showed, away from
the main tumour area, small islands of biliary
epithelium whose nuclei stained strongly for
p53 protein (Fig 2). These glandular elements
were not noticed on the haematoxylin prepara￾tion because of their high degree of differentia￾tion, which mimicked bile duct branches or
islands of accessory seromucinous glands. In
retrospect they appeared more consistent with
highly differentiated tumour glands within thin
walled lymphatic channels or distant foci of
well differentiated., tubular adenocarcinoma,
or both. In addition, minute nests of carci￾noma cells were similarly highlighted within
perineural tissue and lymphatics by nuclear
p53 staining (Fig 3). In a single case a sample
of bile duct epithelium obtained by ERCP and
diagnosed as dysplastic showed a focus of p53
nuclear staining; this potentially neoplastic
area was not recognised as such by conven￾tional histology.
In the 15 patients with PSC without cholan￾giocarcinoma there was no nuclear staining for
p53 protein in the liver tissue.
Discussion
This study shows that p53 protein is overex￾pressed in a high proportion (785%) of
cholangiocarcinoma developed in patients
with PSC. This tumour usually originates
above the junction between the cystic and the
hepatic duct, and often spreads along the
nerves and the nearby vascular structures
invading the liver parenchyma.nd4 This mode
of metastatic spread is further highlighted by

p53 protein staining, which allowed the
recognition of minute tumour deposits.
The detection of mutant p53 protein has
important implications for the clinical prac￾tice.15 16 It has recently been shown that p53
dependent apoptosis modulates the cytotoxic
effects of ionising radiation and chemotherapy
agents,'7 raising the possibility that the p53
gene participates in the mechanism of multi￾drug resistance.18 In patients with solid
tumours both poor prognosis and failure of
chemotherapy may be associated with the
abnormalities of p53 mutations.15 The finding
of a high prevalence of mutant p53 accumula￾tion in cholangiocarcinoma may be linked with
the rapid progression of this tumour and its
poor response to different therapeutic
approaches.
In a recent series of cholangiocarcinoma
samples from Japan, overexpression of the p53
protein was detected in 22% of surgical
tumour specimens. 19 In that study the underly￾ing state of the liver is not described. In our
series, the cholangiocarcinoma arose on the
background of PSC, and the prevalence of p53
staining in the neoplastic tissue was very high
when compared with that obtained by Terada
et al.'9 In our study there was no convincing
evidence that normal or inflamed, but non￾neoplastic biliary epithelium outside the
tumour bulk stained for p53 protein and all 15
cases with longstanding PSC without associ￾ated cholangiocarcinoma were negative in that
respect. This would suggest that the accumula￾tion of p53 is a late stage in the development of
the malignant process.
A very close correlation between immuno￾histochemical overexpression of p53 protein
and mutations in the p53 gene has been estab￾lished,20 and positive tissue staining for p53
protein has been proposed as a marker of
malignancies.'6 21 Detection of mutant p53
protein in tissue biopsy material could be of
value in the follow up of patients with PSC. In
these patients it may be very difficult to distin￾guish between benign and malignant bile duct
strictures. Immunohistochemical staining for
intracellular components such as carcinoem￾bryonic antigen22 have been used to identify
cells with cholangiocarcinoma phenotype. Our
finding of positive staining for p53 protein in
malignant cells outside the main tumour mass
suggests that immunohistochemical detection
of p53 protein could represent an additional
criterion for establishing a diagnosis of cholan￾giocarcinoma in PSC.
