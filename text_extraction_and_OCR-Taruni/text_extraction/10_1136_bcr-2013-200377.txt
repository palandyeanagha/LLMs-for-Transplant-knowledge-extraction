SUMMARY
Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) rarely
cause endocarditis. Of the limited reports of H influenzae
endocarditis, most have been due to encapsulated
organisms or have had limited bacterial characterisation.
We encountered a transplant recipient with native valve
NTHI endocarditis and were intrigued to find no previous
descriptions of this entity. Although it was tempting to
ascribe this infection to our patient’s
immunocompromised status, we investigated his
pathogen further and found that it displayed features
common to invasive NTHI strains including gene
expression for two IgA proteases and serum resistance.
Multilocus sequence typing grouped our NTHI strain with
MLST 159, a group associated with invasive NTHI
infections. Our strain shared identical outer membrane
protein P2 sequences and protein patterns with MLST
159 strains. Aside from providing the first
characterisation of native valve NTHI infection, our
investigation reveals features of epidemiologically
unrelated, clonal NTHI strains that have a predilection for
invasive infections.
BACKGROUND
Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is
an exclusively human pathogen which is a common
cause of sinopulmonary infections such as otitis
media, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease, community acquired pneumonia,
sinusitis and conjunctivitis. We encountered a renal
transplant patient with native valve endocarditis
due to NTHI and we were surprised to find no pre￾vious reports of this entity. Although he was
immunocompromised, we found no reports of
invasive NTHI disease in solid organ transplant
patients. We hypothesised that our patient’s strain
of NTHI had specific virulence traits which,
coupled with his immunosuppressed state, resulted
in invasive infection. In addition to effectively
treating him, we performed studies to better char￾acterise his pathogen.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 64-year-old African-American male renal trans￾plant patient presented to the Buffalo VA Medical
Center with symptoms of fever and chills for
2 days. He received his transplant in 2004 for
hypertensive nephropathy and took mycopheno￾late, tacrolimus and prednisone daily. He had no
transplant-related complications and his serum
creatinine remained 1.4–2.3 mg/dL. There were no
signs of specific infection and he initially received
broad-spectrum antibiotics. His physical examin￾ation was remarkable for a temperature of 100.8°F
and a new systolic murmur along the left sternal
border. His white cell count was 6.3×103 cells/
mm3
, platelets were 53 000/mm3 and serum creat￾ine was 2.5 mg/dL. Urinalysis and urine culture
were unremarkable. All other laboratory values
were unremarkable. ECG, chest X-ray and CT of
his head and sinuses were unrevealing. Two sets of
blood cultures, drawn 29 h apart, grew small
Gram-negative bacilli. Formal identification was
performed by the New York State Department of
Health. Real time PCR determined the absence of
the bexA as well as capB genes, confirming the
blood isolate to be NTHI that proved to be
β-lactamase negative. A transthoracic echocardio￾gram detected independently mobile aortic valve
echodensities, 0.7 cm×0.3 cm in diameter.
INVESTIGATIONS
Identification of the bacterial strain as NTHI and
not H haemolyticus was further confirmed by
immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody
7F3, which detects outer membrane protein (OMP)
P6, a well-conserved epitope of NTHI.1 To deter￾mine if our NTHI strain shared features with other
invasive NTHI strains, we investigated it for several
properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) of whole cell
lysates of our patient’s strain and of NTHI 11P6H,
a well-studied invasive NTHI strain, was performed
(figure 1A). Analysis of our patient’s strain (lane a)
was identical to that of NTHI 11P6H (lane b)
except for a single band. Clonally related NTHI
strains that contain igaA as well as igaB genes, that
encode for two distinct IgA proteases, appear par￾ticularly adapted to infect adults with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).2 Reverse
transcriptase PCR determined that the genome of
our patient’s NTHI strain expressed genes for igaA
as well as igaB (figure 1B).
Resistance to the killing effects of serum provides
NTHI with a potential survival advantage.3 Serum
susceptibility of our patient’s NTHI strain was
determined in two separate experiments, as previ￾ously detailed.3 Colony counts of each was per￾formed in comparison to a negative control strain
(NTHI7p49H), exhibiting 0% survival in each, and
a positive control strain (NTHI101p3H) exhibiting

57% and 100% survival in each experiment respectively. Our
patient’s NTHI strain had 100% survival in pooled donor
serum in each experiment (figure 2).
Finally, to assess our strain in relation to other NTHI strains,
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed, by deter￾mination of defined internal fragments of seven housekeeping
genes.4 Sequences submitted to http://haemophilus.mlst.net
grouped our patient’s NTHI strain in MLST 159, a group that
is associated with invasive infections and infections in COPD.5
The gene that encodes NTHI OMP P2 has remarkable diversity
of sequences among NTHI strains.6 Therefore, to investigate
the relationship between our NTHI strain and MLST 159
strains by a second independent means, we determined the
sequence of the OMP P2 gene of our NTHI isolate and found it
to be identical to the sequences of the other MLST 159 strains.
TREATMENT
Our patient received 6 weeks of ceftriaxone, 2 g intravenously
each day with a complete resolution of presenting signs and
symptoms.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
One week following completion of antibiotics, two sets of
blood cultures confirmed that the patient was no longer bacter￾aemic and was clinically cured. He remains well 9 months after
completion of antibiotics.
DISCUSSION
This is the first well-characterised case of NTHI endocarditis.
The usual spectrum of NTHI disease in humans consists of sino￾pulmonary infections such as otitis media, exacerbations of
COPD, community acquired pneumonia, sinusitis and conjunc￾tivitis.7 Endocarditis due to Haemophilus species collectively
comprises up to 5% of all infective endocarditis.7 Of these, the
overwhelming majority is due to Haemophilus parainfluenzae,
Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus.7 H
influenzae endocarditis is exceedingly rare, comprising 0.8–
1.3% of reported endocarditis cases.8 For example, in two
series of endocarditis due to Haemophilus species, H influenzae
accounted for only 1 of 14 cases in the first and only 3 of 42
cases in the second.8 9 H influenzae strain typing was not given
for either of these series.
Review of the literature revealed only 15 reported cases of all
H influenzae endocarditis (table 1). Of these, five were due to
encapsulated strains including several type b strains 10–13 and
one type a strain.13 Of the 15 cases, 9 gave no indication of
serotyping and thus NTHI may have been among these, but
Figure 2 Serum bactericidal assays. Serum survival of our patient’s
non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) endocarditis strain (A)
was determined in two separate experiments in comparison to a
negative control strain NTHI7p49H (B) and a positive control strain
NTHI101p3H (C) in pooled donor serum.

may have been unrecognised.8–10 13 14 One involved a
prosthetic-valve infection.14
We found only one report of NTHI endocarditis and that
involved prosthetic intravascular material.10 Early reports of
endocarditis due to H influenzae strains whose serotyping was
not reported may predate routine specific identification. A
review of all reported cases of H influenzae endocarditis indi￾cates a female predominance (2:1), equal distribution between
aortic and mitral valves and a broad age range (2–76 years),
consistent with demographics for other causes of endocarditis.15
Vaccination against encapsulated H influenzae (type b) with
the conjugated Hib vaccine over the past 15–20 years has dra￾matically diminished the incidence of infection with this patho￾gen.16 At the same time, a relative rise in incidence of non-type
b H influenzae strains has been noted in Western countries.17 In
Sweden, where Hib vaccine coverage rate is 99%, a significant
increase in the incidence of invasive NTHI disease has occurred.
Among these, 37% were in individuals with evidence of
immune compromise.18 Thus, the emergence of invasive NTHI
strains, in healthy as well as immunocompromised patients in
the Hib vaccine era, bears special significance.
The virulence traits of encapsulated strains have been well
described, including a polysaccharide capsule, composed of
polyribitol ribose phosphate for type b H influenzae that
permits evasion of phagocytosis and opsonisation.7 In contrast,
virulence traits of non-typeable strains are not well defined. A
high degree of genomic diversity among non-typeable strains
may allow for acquisition of mechanisms to further heighten
virulent potential. Biofilms of NTHI, described in the middle
ear of animal models as well as in children with otitis media,
may confer relative resistance and impair host clearance.19 IgA
proteases may play a role in NTHI virulence. Clonally related
strains of NTHI expressing two IgA proteases are more fre￾quently recovered from respiratory isolates in COPD, support￾ing a role for IgA proteases in the pathogenesis of infection in
COPD.5
Host factors may also promote invasive NTHI infection.
Most people with invasive NTHI infections have underlying
conditions such as alcoholism, cardiopulmonary disease, HIV,
cancer, splenectomy and hypogammaglobulinaemia.7 8 While it
was tempting to ascribe this infection to our patient’s immuno￾compromised status, we explored characteristics of his NTHI
strain. The survival of NTHI from the lower respiratory tree is
associated with its resistance to complement-dependent killing
by human serum.3 We were intrigued that our patient’s NTHI
strain exhibited remarkable serum resistance and moreover that
it expressed igaA as well as igaB, an additional feature of inva￾sive NTHI strains. We were further intrigued to find that our
patient’s NTHI strain shared several additional features with
epidemiologically unrelated NTHI strains. Notably, our strain
shared identical OMP P2 sequences and nucleotide sequences,
as well as SDS PAGE protein patterns, with other MLST 159
strains, including NTHI 11P6H (figure 1). While MLST 159
also includes several non-invasive strains, we made the remark￾able observation that this group includes five other blood iso￾lates of NTHI.5 Collectively, our studies demonstrate that our
patient’s NTHI strain fits a clonally related group that bears a
propensity for severe NTHI infections.
We suspect this case of invasive NTHI endocarditis resulted
from poor host response as well as from characteristics of the
pathogen. Our investigation highlights the features of clonal
strains of NTHI that have a predilection for invasive infections.
While this is the first well-characterised report of NTHI endo￾carditis, we suspect that our patient’s experience is not unique
and may have occurred in others, but may have gone unrecog￾nised. We offer our experience to highlight special characteris￾tics of our patient’s NTHI strain, to encourage specific
identification of invasive strains and to alert clinicians to the
presence of invasive NTHI infections.
Learning points
▸ Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), while a
common cause of sinopulmonary infections, can be a cause
of infective endocarditis. High-grade NTHI bacteraemia
without an obvious source merits an investigation for
endocarditis.
▸ While immunosuppression and host factors may play a role
in serious NTHI infection, invasive strains, including that of
our patient, bear notable common features including
expression of two IgA proteases and serum resistance.
▸ Multilocus sequence typing confirmed that our patient’s
strain fits an epidemiologically unrelated clonal group of
NTHI that have a predilection for invasive disease.
▸ We suspect that this case of NTHI endocarditis arose from a
combination of impaired host response and from traits of
the pathogen.
▸ Our experience highlights the importance of MLST 159
group of NTHI in invasive infections.
