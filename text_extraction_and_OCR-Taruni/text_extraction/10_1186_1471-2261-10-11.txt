infarction

Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are important cellular components and their dysfunction is associated with
various diseases. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. Although
several miRNAs are reported to be associated with AMI, more novel miRNAs are needed to further investigate and
improve certainty
Methods: We applied a well-established acute myocardial infarction rat model and performed miRNAs microarray
experiments upon the myocardium tissue of rats with AMI and under sham control. We identified the differentially
expressed miRNAs and analyzed the function of miRNA targets, transcription factors, and host genes based on
bioinformatics.
Results: As a result, the levels of expression of seventeen miRNAs significantly deregulated, of which four miRNAs
were further validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, we observed that the transcription factors, targets, and host genes
of these deregulated miRNAs are enriched in cardiovascular-related functions.
Conclusion: We found that the miRNAs expression level altered in rats with AMI and differentially expressed
miRNAs may be novel biomarkers of AMI.
Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
represent one of the most important cellular compo￾nents. Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs have
distinct expression profiles and play crucial roles in the
regulation of gene expression during development stages
such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis [1].
Deregulation of miRNAs is associated with various dis￾eases including cardiovascular diseases [1-4]. In recent
years, efforts have been made to identify the miRNAs
associated with cardiovascular diseases [1]. For example,
miRNAs involved in cardiac hypertrophy and heart fail￾ure such as miR-208, miR-133, miR-195, miR-21, and
miR-126 have been reported in several studies [5-8].
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most
serious cardiovascular diseases [9]. Recently, some miR￾NAs for example miR-21, miR-1, miR-216[10], and
miR-29 family[11], were reported to be deregulated in
myocardial infarction. However, considering the com￾plex genetic variants in AMI, further investigation is
needed to ascertain if more novel miRNAs are asso￾ciated with AMI.
In this study, to explore the expression of miRNA in
ischemic myocardium in rat with AMI, we employed
microarray technique on the border zone myocardium
of rats with AMI and sham-operated controls. As a
result, we found that the levels of expression of seven￾teen miRNAs significantly changed in the progression of
AMI. Furthermore, some of the deregulated miRNAs
were confirmed by qRT-PCR, and the functions of
miRNA targets, transcription factors, and host genes
were also analyzed.

models were induced by the ligation of anterior des￾cending coronary artery in adult Spraque-Dawley rats
(180 to 200 gram), as described by Shyu et al. [12]. On
the first postoperative day, the survivals were randomly
divided into three groups: 2 days after AMI, 7 days after
AMI, 14 days after AMI. In the sham-control group,
rats were exposed to all surgical procedures except the
ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery. Each
group has five individual samples. This study was
approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care
and Use Committee of Peking University Health Science
Center (Peking, China). The investigation conformed to
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the China National Institute of Health.
Microarray analysis
For miRNAs microarray analysis, total RNA from the
myocardial tissues in the border zone of infracted myo￾cardium was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Low-mole￾cular-weight RNA (<200 nt) was isolated from the 30 μg
total RNA using a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Profiling of miRNAs
expression was analyzed by CapitalBio (CapitalBio Corp,
Peking, China) using CapitalBio Mammalian miRNA
Array V3.0.(Which includes 924 known miRNAs for
human, mouse and rat). The miRNA microarray from
CapitalBio Corporation was a double-channel fluores￾cent chip. Experimental procedures were performed as
described in detail on the website of CapitalBio http://
www.capitalbio.com. The T4 RNA ligase labeling
method according to Thomson’s protocol was adopted
[13]. Briefly, 4 ug of low-molecular-weight RNA was
labeled with 500 ng 5’-phosphate-cytidyl-uridyl-cy3/5-3’
(Dharmacon) with 2 units T4 RNA ligase (NEB). The
labeling reaction was performed at 4°C for 2 hours.
Labeled RNA was precipitated with 0.3 M sodium acet￾ate, 2.5 volumes ethanol and resuspended in 15 μl of
hybridization buffer containing 3× SSC, 0.2% SDS and
15% formamide. The array was hybridized at 42°C over￾night and washed with two consecutive solutions (0.2%
SDS, 2× SSC at 42°C for 5 min, and 0.2% SSC for 5 min
at room temperature). The miRNAs Arrays were
scanned with a confocal LuxScan™ scanner (CapitalBio
Corp, Peking, China).
Intensity data was extracted from the TIFF images
using LuxScan™ 3.0 software (CapitalBio Corp, Peking,
China). The low-intensity spots in which fewer than
30% of the signal pixels exceeded the median back￾ground plus two times its standard deviation were
removed. Then normalization was performed based on
mean array intensity for inter-array comparison. To
determine the significant differentially expressed miR￾NAs, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version
3.0, from Stanford University) was performed using a
two class unpaired comparison in the SAM procedure
[14]. miRNAs with adjusted P values less than 0.05 and
with either a greater than 2.0-fold change or less than a
0.5-fold fold change in expression compared with con￾trols were identified as differentially regulated miRNAs
[15,16]. The entire datasets (for miRNAs) described here
are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) through series acces￾sion number GSE19695.
Quantitative reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
To validate the microarray results in this study, four of
the de-regulated miRNAs were randomly selected for
further validation by qRT-PCR.
Since miRNAs are ~ 22 nucleotides in length, it could
not be reverse transcribed according to traditional
method. So we designed a stem-loop RT primer to
induce a reverse transcribe reaction. For PCR reaction,
Gene-specific anti-sense primers and a universal sense
primer were designed according to miRNAs sequences.
All primers used in this study were synthesized at Invi￾trogen (Invitrogen, Peking, China). All the primer
sequences were listed in an additional file (see Addi￾tional file 1).
Each reaction mixture of RT contained RNA samples
including about 100 ng of purified total RNA, 50 nM
stem-loop RT primer, 1× RT buffer, 0.25 mM each of
dNTPs(Takara), 0.1 mM DTT, 200 U Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 20 U RNase inhi￾bitor(Takara). The 20 uL reactions were incubated for
30 min at 16°C, 30 min at 42°C, 5 min at 85°C, and
then held at 4°C[17].
Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed using the
Roche 1.2 real-time PCR instrument (Roche). The
expression of the U6 small nucleolar RNA gene was
used as an internal control.
The PCR was performed in triplicate, the 20 uL PCR
reaction contained: 1 μL of cDNA solution, 2 uL Light￾Cycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche),
and 0.3 uM of each primer. The reactions were incu￾bated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C
for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s. Samples were also run on a 1.5%
agarose gel to confirm specificity.
The relative expression level for each miRNA was cal￾culated using the comparative CT method [18,19]. To
account for possible differences in the amount of start￾ing RNA, miRNA expression was normalized to small
nucleolar RNA U6.
Transcription factors (TFs) and targets of miRNAs
The transcription of miRNAs is regulated by TFs and
miRNAs exert their functions by regulating target

mRNAs. Therefore, the TFs and targets of miRNAs may
provide clues to the functions of miRNAs. We obtained
experimentally validated miRNA targets from TarBase
[20]. As a result, 9 of the 17 deregulated miRNAs having
one or more targets were found. In total, 195 miRNA￾target pairs were identified (see Additional File 2). We
obtained the TFs that regulate the 17 deregulated miR￾NAs from TransmiR[21]. As a result, we identified 14
experimentally validated TF-miRNA pairs, in which 14
unique TFs regulate 6 of the 17 deregulated miRNAs
(see Additional File 3).
Gene function enrichment analysis
We carried out gene function enrichment analysis for
miRNA transcription factors, miRNA targets, and
miRNA host genes using EASE[22]. We chose all
human genes as the background gene list. Bonferroni
corrections to P values were used in the analysis.
Results
Altered expression of miRNAs in the myocardium
of rats with AMI
Microarray data mining and differential analyses
resulted in 17 significantly deregulated miRNAs asso￾ciated with AMI (Table 1, Figure 1). On day 2, miR-31,
miR-223, miR-18a, and miR-18b were up-regulated,
whereas miR-451 and miR-499-5p were down-regulated.
Two of these aberrantly expressed miRNAs (miR-223,
mir-499) have been reported to be associated with
inflammation [23-25]. On day 7, miR-31, miR-214, miR￾199a-5p, and miR-199a-3p were up-regulated, whereas
miR-181c, miR-29b, miR-26b, miR-181d, mir-126, mir￾499-5p, and miR-1 were down-regulated. Some of the
deregulated miRNAs (miR-181, miR-26, miR-1, mir-29,
miR-214, miR-126, and miR-499) are reported to be
related to hypoxia, cell development, and cell growth
[1,5,7,25]. These results indicate that miRNAs may take
part in the regulation of myocardial remodeling in the
early stage of myocardial infarction. On day 14, miR￾214, mir-923, miR-711, and miR-199a-3p, and miR-31
were up-regulated, of which miR-31 showed the most
striking up-regulation (an increase of eight-fold com￾pared with the sham-control). Among those seventeen
deregulated miRNAs miR-31 was up-regulated on day 2,
day 7 and day 14. miR-199a was up-regulated on day 7
and day 14. miR-214 was up-regulated on day 7 and day
14. miR-499 was down-regulated on day 2 and day 7.
For the 17 deregulated miRNAs, the down-regulated
miRNAs tended to be more enriched in miRNAs which
are highly expressed in normal cardiovascular tissues,
whereas the up-regulated miRNAs tend to show lower
levels of expression in normal cardiovascular tissues.
We investigated miRNA expression in normal tissues
based on miRNA expression data provided by Liang et
al. [26]. As a result, among the 17 deregulated miRNAs,
six of them (C-miRNAs) showed the highest expression

level in cardiovascular tissues, and the other 11 miRNAs
showed the highest expression level in non-cardiovascu￾lar tissues (O-miRNAs) (Table 1). Furthermore, 66.7%
(4/6) of the C-miRNAs were down-regulated, whereas
only 36.4% (4/11) of the O-miRNAs were down-regu￾lated (Figure 2). Therefore, C-miRNAs tend to be down￾regulated in AMI, although the statistical test was not
significant (P = 0.25, Fisher’s exact test), owing possibly
to small sample size.
Confirmation of the altered expression of miRNAs
by qRT-PCR
To verify the accuracy of the microarray results above,
we randomly selected four of the seventeen deregulated
miRNAs for further confirmation using qRT-PCR. The
result of qRT-PCR was consistent with that of microar￾ray analysis (Figure 3 and Additional File 4). Expression
levels of miR-126 and miR-499 were greatly down-regu￾lated after AMI, whereas expression levels of miR-31
and miR-214 increased after AMI (Figure 3 and Addi￾tional File 4).
Enriched functions of TFs and targets of miRNAs
We analyzed using EASE the enriched functions of TFs
that were regulating the 17 deregulated miRNAs and
the enriched functions of the targets of the 17 deregu￾lated miRNAs [22]. As a result, both sets of genes were
enriched in cardiovascular-associated functions (see
Additional File 5 and File 6). For example, the signifi￾cant gene functions for miRNA TFs include “myogen￾esis” (Bonferroni P = 1.59 × 10-4) and “muscle
development” (Bonferroni P = 9.21 × 10-4); the signifi￾cant gene functions for miRNA targets include “muscle
thin filament tropomyosin” (Bonferroni P = 5.93 × 10-3)
and “striated muscle thin filament” (Bonferroni P = 5.85
× 10-2). This result indicates that the deregulated miR￾NAs tend to have roles in cardiovascular disease by
coupling with cardiovascular function-associated TFs
and target genes.

miRNAs are reported to be non-randomly distributed in
the genome. For example, many miRNAs (intronic miR￾NAs) are located in the introns of protein-coding genes
(host genes) and show high co-expression with the host
genes[27], suggesting the intronic miRNAs may have asso￾ciated functions with their host genes. Therefore, we ana￾lyzed the functions of the host genes of the 17 deregulated
miRNAs. As a result, seven of the seventeen deregulated
miRNAs are located in the introns of protein-coding
genes (Table 2). The function enrichment analysis of the
host genes did not find enriched functions. This may be
the result of a small sample size of only seven host genes.
We next manually curated the functions of these host
genes and found that most host genes (6/7) were asso￾ciated with cardiovascular-related functions (Table 2), sug￾gesting that the deregulated miRNA may have functions
in ischemia myocardium by co-expression with their host
genes. In conclusion, the gene function enrichment

analysis provided further evidence that the deregulated
miRNAs we identified were associated with AMI.
Discussion
miRNA regulates gene expression by binding and modu￾lating the translation of specific miRNAs. In this study,
we identified 17 deregulated miRNAs in a rat model of
AMI. Our data shows that the change of expression
levels of miRNAs is in accordance with the progression
of AMI. In the early stage of myocardial infarction, the
pathological change in the myocardium occurs with
inflammation and intracellular and interstitial myocar￾dial edema. Other pathological changes such as hypoxia,
myocardial necrosis, fibrosis are secondary. Some
deregulated miRNAs that respond to AMI are reported
to be associated with hypoxia, cell differentiation,
inflammation, development, and fibrosis [1,5,7,23,25].
These results suggest that miRNAs have a critical role
in cardiac remodeling after AMI. Furthermore, miRNAs
highly expressed in cardiovascular tissues tend to be
down-regulated after AMI, indicating that a high level
of expression is needed for these miRNAs to maintain
the normal functions of the cardiovascular system. This
suggests that miRNAs may have important roles not
only in the normal development of the cardiovascular
system but also in cardiovascular diseases.
Finally, function enrichment analyses was carried out
upon TFs, targets, and host genes of the deregulated
miRNAs. All these gene sets are enriched in cardiovas￾cular functions, providing more solid evidence of the
associations between these deregulated miRNAs and
acute myocardial infarction. Although it is still unclear
how these deregulated miRNAs exert their effects in the
progression of myocardial infarction.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we identified some miRNAs that showed
altered expressions in rat myocardium with acute myo￾cardial infarction. These miRNAs may be potential bio￾markers for the diagnosis and treatment of acute
myocardial infarction. Furthermore, investigating how
these miRNAs exert their effects in acute myocardial
infarction may become increasingly important.
