Abstract
The phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) was recently discovered as a target autoantigen in patients with idiopathic
membranous nephropathy (IMN). Published evidence suggests that the autoantibodies directed towards a conformation
dependent epitope are currently effectively detected by a cell based assay (CBA) utilizing indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)
on tissue culture cells transfected with the PLA2R cDNA. Limitations of such IIF-CBA assays include observer dependent
subjective evaluation of semi-quantitative test results and the protocols are not amenable to high throughput diagnostic
testing. We developed a quantitative, observer independent, high throughput capture immunoassay for detecting PLA2R
autoantibodies on an addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) platform. Since reactive domains of PLA2R (i.e. epitopes)
could be used to improve diagnostic tests by using small peptides in various high throughput diagnostic platforms, we
identified PLA2R epitopes that bound autoantibodies of IMN patients. These studies confirmed that inter-molecular epitope
spreading occurs in IMN but use of the cognate synthetic peptides in immunoassays was unable to conclusively distinguish
between IMN patients and normal controls. However, combinations of these peptides were able to effectively absorb anti￾PLA2R reactivity in IIF-CBA and an immunoassay that employed a lysate derived from HEK cells tranfected with and
overexpressing PLA2R. While we provide evidence of intermolecular epitope spreading, our data indicates that in addition
to conformational epitopes, human anti-PLA2R reactivity in a commercially available CBA and an addressable laser bead
immunoassay is significantly absorbed by peptides representing epitopes of PLA2R.

Introduction
Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common
causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults [1,2]. Patients
typically present with nephrotic range proteinuria, edema,
hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia. Two different forms of
MN have been identified: a primary of idiopathic form (IMN),
which is found in 80% of MN patients, and a secondary form
associated with various malignancies, autoimmune diseases and
some infections [1,2]. Certain histopathological features that can
help distinguish IMN from secondary MN include the presence of
immune complex deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial
space in secondary MN as compared to the exclusively subepi￾thelial and intramembranous deposits seen in IMN. IgG4 has been
reported to be the predominant Ig subclass in IMN, whereas IgG3
and IgG2 tend to be more dominant in glomerular deposits of
secondary MN [3].
In the 1950s, Heymann and his associates developed an
experimental animal model wherein rats developed severe
proteinuria after active or passive immunization with certain
antigenic fractions of proximal tubular brush border [4]. The
histopathological features of renal involvement in this model were
similar to those seen in human IMN and additional studies showed
that antibodies bound to a membrane receptor expressed on rat
renal podocytes, which was eventually identified as megalin [5].
Nevertheless, there have been limitations to directly relating
observations in this animal model to human disease. First, to date
there is no evidence indicating that megalin is expressed on human
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61669

podocytes. Furthermore, in contrast to anti-megalin antibodies
being capable of activating the complement pathway that leads to
podocyte damage, antibodies of the IgG4 subclass that are
characteristic of human MN, are believed to be ineffective
activators of the classical pathway of complement [6,7].
Evidence that in situ formation of immune complexes is
responsible for human MN was first described in a single case
report in 2004 by Debiec et al [8]. In that report, anti-neutral
endopeptidase (NEP) antibodies of a NEP deficient mother crossed
the placenta into the fetal circulation where they bound the
glomerular basement membrane as well as NEP on fetal
podocytes. The disease process in this fetus was reminiscent of
the Heymann nephritis model in rats [8,9].
More recently in 2009, Beck et al described the M-type
phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) as an autoantigen in MN
based on immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry [10].
PLA2R is a 180 kDa type I transmembrane protein that belongs
to the C-type animal lectin family such as the mannose receptor
[11]. PLA2R is composed of a large extracellular region consisting
of a N-terminal cysteine-rich region (C-R), a fibronectin type II
domain (FNII), eight C-type lectin like domains (CTLD), and a
short intracellular C-terminal region. Although PLA2R is
expressed on alveolar type II epithelial cells and on neutrophils,
data to date suggest that it is mainly restricted to kidney podocytes
[5]. PLA2R has been found to promote senescence in human
fibroblasts and is involved in both positive and negative regulation
of secretory PLA2.
Autoantibodies directed to PLA2R were found in 52–82% of
individuals with IMN [10] but only to a small percentage (5–25%)
in sera from patients with secondary MN as detected by Western
immnunoblot, IIF-CBA and ELISA [12–14]. The observation that
some patients with IMN do not have the PLA2R autoantibodies
could be explained by limitations of current immunoassays, and/
or the absence of these autoantibodies during treatment or inactive
disease. In addition, autoantibodies to PLA2R may not be a
universal feature of IMN because other autoantibodies, such as
those directed against a-enolase or aldose reductase, have
previously been reported in patients with IMN, albeit at a much
lower frequency [15,16]. Proteinuria as a traditional marker of
disease activity in IMN correlates with, but does not perfectly
parallel, anti-PLA2R levels [17]. Proteinuria often remains
elevated when antibody levels are undetectable, which has lead
to the hypothesis that there might be other yet to be identified
serum autoantibodies in IMN. Since anti-PLA2R are strongly
associated with disease activity, it is thought they are pathogenic
but no clear mechanisms of pathogenesis for IMN have been
identified so far [18,19].
In order to detect and quantify circulating anti-PLA2R
antibodies, an indirect immunofluorescence cell based assay (IIF￾CBA) [20,21] and ELISAs have been developed. For the most
part, ELISAs based on recombinant human PLA2R c-DNAs
expressed in a human cell lines have been developed in individual
labs and are not widely validated [12,22]. The commercially
available IIF-CBA diagnostic kit contains a mosaic of two biochips
in each well: one overlaid with human embryonic kidney
(HEK)293 cells transfected with and over-expressing the PLA2R
cDNA, while the "control" biochip contains non-transfected HEK
cells. The non-transfected cells are important in assessing positive
reactions because human autoimmune sera often have a variety of
autoantibodies directed against nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell
surface targets, making interpretation of results quite challenging
even for an experienced technologist. While the IIF-CBA is
relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, it has some limitations
in that it is not amenable to high throughput diagnostics used in
many larger diagnostic laboratories; it is semi-quantitative;
interpretation of the IIF result is largely subjective and it is
relatively labour intensive.
Therefore, our goal was to develop a quantitative, high
throughput immunoassay that has at least comparable sensitivity
and specificity of the IIF-CBA and avoids the subjective
assessment of IIF especially in the presence of other autoantibodies
that may obscure a true positive result. We anticipated that such a
new quantitative diagnostic assay might be more representative of
the immunological state of the disease, a feature which in turn
might benefit patients. To this end, we tested recombinant over￾expressed PLA2R as a potential target on an addressable laser
bead immunoassay (ALBIA) diagnostic platforms and examined
overlapping PLA2R 15mer peptides representing the full length
protein as an approach to identifying a specific epitope which
could then be adapted to an improved immunoassay by using
smaller peptides [23].
Materials and Methods
Patients and Controls
Patient and control serum samples were collected at the Medical
School Hannover, (Germany). This study was approved by Ethics
Committee of Medical School Hannover, Germany, (Nr: 1246–
2011) and patient data were anonymously used under consider￾ation of the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration of human
research ethics.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Cell Based Assay for anti￾PLA2R
Patient and control serum samples were identified as PLA2R
positive or negative samples based on their reactivity in a
commercially available indirect immunofluorescence cell based
assay (IIF-CBA: Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
PLA2R Construct, Western Blot and Indirect
Immunofluorescence
A PLA2R isoform1 (Accession: Q13018, 1463 aa, 180 kDa) was
constructed and inserted into a GFP vector (Clontech Laboratories
Inc., Saint-German-en-Laye, France). In order to test reactivity of
our construct, we performed IIF with patient serum as primary
antibody diluted 1:100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Santa Cruz Biotech￾nology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS as
secondary antibody. Western immunoblots were performed on
transfected cell lysates (described below) with a commercial goat
anti-PLA2R (Acris Antibodies, Herford, Germany), mouse anti￾GFP (Santa Cruz) and patient sera as described above.
Protein Coupling, Blocking and Storage onto
Microspheres
Details of the procedure and components of the coupling
procedures and assay development are found in Methods S1.
Briefly, 10 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC) and normal human serum (NHS) were dissolved in 200 ml
of Activation Buffer. A desired volume of beads (Luminex Corp.,
Austin, TX, USA) was pipetted into micro tubes (USA Scientific
Inc. Ocala, FL, USA) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min.
The supernatant was carefully decanted, the desired amount of
activation buffer was added and the beads were resuspended by
gentle sonication and vortexing. Diluted EDC and NHS were
added and the beads sonicated and vortexed again followed by a

20 minute-incubation in the dark at room temperature. While
the beads were incubating, protein samples were diluted to the
optimal concentration in Coupling Buffer (usually 50 mg/ml; see
Methods S1). After incubation, beads were centrifuged at
14,000 rpm for 3 minutes and the supernatant decanted before
adding coupling buffer at 2–3 times the original bead volume.
The microspheres were again sonicated and vortexed before
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for another 3 minutes. The
supernatant was decanted and protein was coupled to micro￾spheres by adding the optimal amount of protein to the
microspheres, which were resuspended as described above. The
beads were then incubated overnight at 4uC on rotator and then
stored at 4uC in the dark until required for use.
ALBIA Utilizing PLA2R Peptides
2 ml of suspended beads in solution (Luminex Corp.), 35 ml of
horse radish experiment (HRP) sample diluent (INOVA Diagnos￾tics Inc.) and 5 ml of diluted serum were pipetted into the wells of
light tight microtitre plates (Luminex Corp.). The plate was
covered so as to avoid sustained exposure of the beads to ambient
light and incubated at 4uC on a shaker set at 600 rpm over night.
The next day, 40 ml of diluted, phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated
secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG/mouse anti-human
IgG4, 1:50/1:25 in HRP sample diluents, Jackson ImmunoR￾esearch, West Grove, PA, USA) were added and incubated with
agitation at 600 rpm for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
Plates were analyzed by ALBIA using a Luminex-100 flow
apparatus.
Cell Lysates
HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Cedarlane,
Burlington, ON, Canada) were seeded in culture plates (NuncUp￾Cell Surface 10 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold,
Germany) and incubated for one day to enhance attachment
before transfection with the PLA2R construct as described above.
It was determined that at 48 hours after transfection, HEK293
cells most efficiently over-expressed PLA2R as determined by IIF.
Hence, subsequent cell lysates were prepared by first washing cells
with cold PBS and then harvesting cells on ice using cold NETN
buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7,4),
1% Nonidet P-40/Tergitol, protease inhibitor (Complete Mini,
Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), phosphatase inhibitor (Phos￾STOP, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Lysates were stored at
280uC overnight and then centrifuged for 15 min at 11.000 rpm
at 4uC. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and
stored at 220uC.
ALBIA Utilizing Cell Lysates
A 200 ml suspension of ALBIA beads (MicroPlex Microsphere
(non-magnetic) LC10052, MiriaBio Group, San Francisco, CA,
USA) coupled with 50 mg/ml mouse anti-GFP (Abcam, Toronto,
ON, Canada) were added to 1 ml of PLA2R transfected HEK293
cell lysates and incubated on a shaker for 1 hour at room
temperature. Beads were then washed twice with 500 ml Wash
Buffer (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and once with 500 ml
Blocking/Storage Buffer (PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
0.02% Tween-20, 0.05% azide, pH 7.4) before resuspending the
beads in 200 ml Blocking/Storage Buffer. 2 ml of the resuspended
beads, 30 ml of HRP sample diluent (INOVA Diagnostics Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) and 10 ml of diluted serum (1:100 in HRP
sample diluent) were pipetted into the wells of microtiter plate,
covered and incubated on a shaker, 600 rpm, for 1 hour at room
temperature. 40 ml of PE conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:50/
HRP sample diluent, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or 40 ml of PE
conjugated mouse anti-human IgG4 (1:25 in HRP sample diluents,
Jackson ImmunoResearch) was then added and the plate was
incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The
reactivity of individual sera was then analyzed using a Luminex￾100 plate reader.
Epitope Mapping
For epitope mapping, sequential human PLA2R isoform1
(Accession: Q13018) peptides were synthesised on a cellulose
membrane using SPOT technology as previously described [24].
Briefly, peptides of 15 amino acids (aa) overlapping by 5 aa were
produced by delivering activated amino acids to the corresponding
spot on a derivatized cellulose membrane. In between cycles, aa
were fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) deprotected, so that
coupling of the next aa was possible. Spots were run in duplicate
to gain more reproducible results.
Peptide-antibody interactions were observed by first blocking
the membrane with 3% milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) for 1
hour at room temperature, then incubating with diluted serum
(1:00 in 3% milk/TBS) for 2 hours. Anti-PLA2R antibodies were
detected by incubating the membrane with anti-human IgG HRP
conjugated (1:10.000/TBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour
and then developed for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) (Amer￾shamTM ECLTM Western Blotting Detection Reagents by GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
It is possible to reprobe stripped and regenerated membranes
for several cycles To accomplish this, the membrane was
immersed in a solution containing 100 mM b- mercaptoethanol,
2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 62,5 mM Tris-Cl pH 6,7 and it
was incubated for 30 minutes at 50uC. Thereafter the membrane
is washed in several changes of TBS and to verify successful
stripping, the membrane was incubated with the secondary
antibody only and checked with ECL.
Randomly selected sera from seven patients with MGN that
were positive for anti-PLA2R antibodies, as well three MGN anti￾PLA2R negative sera and five normal healthy controls were tested
on the membranes. Commercially available rabbit anti-PLA2R
antibody (1:500/TBS, Abcam, rabbit polyclonal anti-PLA2R,
immunogen: synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal
domain of human PLA2R) served as a positive control. Donkey
anti-human IgG HRP conjugated (1:10.000/TBS, Jackson Im￾munoResearch), mouse anti-human IgG4 HRP conjugated
(1:1.000/TBS, Abcam) or HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:5.000/TBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were utilized as sec￾ondary antibodies when appropriate.
PLA2R Peptide ELISA
100 ml of 2 mg/ml peptides diluted in coating buffer representing
the PLA2R reactive epitopes were commercially produced (EZ
Biolab, Carmel, IN, USA) and coated onto 96-well microtiter
plates. The covered plate was then incubated overnight at 4uC and
then washed twice by filling each well with 200 ml of PBS. The
plate was then blocked by incubating 200 ml of blocking solution
(5% skim milk in PBS) per well overnight at 4uC. After washing
the plate twice, 100 ml of diluted primary antibody (patient serum
diluted 1:100 in PBS) were pipetted into each well and the covered
plate was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After the
primary antibody was removed and the plate was washed four
times with PBS, the plate was incubated with diluted secondary
antibody (1:10.000/PBS, HRP conjugated mouse anti-human
IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:5.000/PBS, or HRP conjugated
anti-human IgG4, Abcam) for 1–2 hours at room temperature.
The plates were washed again in four changes of PBS to remove
unbound proteins. 100 ml of substrate solution was added to each

well followed by 100 ml of stop reagent. The absorbance at
450 nm (reference: 540 nm) was read on a JANUSH MDT
Automated Workstation (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Absorption Assay
Individual and mixtures of all peptides produced as described
above (Table 1) were stored at 5 mg/ml at 280uC. The peptides
were added to achieve 14, 70, and 126 mg in each absorption
reaction. Controls included an equivalent amount of peptide
buffer (1% BSA in PBS) containing no competing peptides and an
unrelated synthetic peptide GE-1 (RCD8/Hedls; a 22mer peptide
representing a major epitope commercially prepared by Pepceu￾tiucals Ltd., Nottingham, United Kingdom) [25] as a negative
reference control used at the same concentrations as the PLA2R
peptides. Anti-PLA2R sera were separately tested to achieve the
usual working dilution of 1:100. After incubation overnight at 4uC,
the various solutions were assayed as per normal protocols in the
commercial IIF-CBA and in the ALBIA (see ALBIA utilizing cell
lysates and IIF-CBA above for details).
Results
The full-length human PLA2R construct that was cloned into a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector and over-expressed in
HEK293 cells was verified by standard sequencing techniques.
Successful transfection and reactivity of the GFP construct was
confirmed by Western immunoblot employing commercially
available anti-GFP and anti-PLA2R antibodies as well as patient
samples on transfected HEK293 cell lysates (Figure S1).
Next, when ALBIA beads were indirectly coupled with the full
length protein captured from cell lysates and tested with sera from
165 patients with membranous nephropathy; 85 (52%) of those
tested positive, whereas 80 (48%) tested negative for anti-PLA2R
antibodies on CBA. As controls, sera from 50 normal healthy
controls, 25 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 25
patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly
Wegener’s granulomatosis) were also tested on this new ALBIA. As
individual groups of sera, the fluorescence median value of IIF￾CBA positive serum samples in the ALBIA was significantly higher
than values observed with IIF-CBA negative, as well as controls.
ROC analysis was performed to compare the ALBIA to the IIF￾CBA assay because the latter was regarded the only reliable
commercially available immunoassay and was hence was used as
the reference standard to define the outcome (anti-PLA2R positive
vs. anti-PLA2R negative). Thus, the area under the curve (AUC)
for the IIF-CBA assay was set at 100% (Figure 1; Figure S2). By
comparison, the ALBIA curve covered 97.8% and with the cut-off
value calculated from the ROC analysis, the assay classified
patients with a sensitivity of 95.3% and a specificity of 93.9%. The
ALBIA was also performed using anti-human IgG4as secondary
antibody leading to similar results with less background and a
lower cut-off value (AUC: 96.3%; sensitivity: 94.1%; specificity:
96.1%). In order to exclude nonspecific antibody binding to GFP
moieties, samples were also tested on beads coupled with moc￾GFP transfected HEK cell lysates and to an unrelated GFP￾coupled aquaporin 4 protein; both of which showed ALBIA
fluorescence values well below cut-off values (data not shown).
Assuming that further knowledge about antibody-antigen
interactions could improve assay development, we proceeded to
determine epitope(s) bound by the human anti-PLA2R autoanti￾bodies by using SPOT technology [24]. Overlapping 15mer
peptides representing the full length PLA2R protein were
synthesized on nitrocellulose membranes and potential epitopes
detected by conventional Western blot techniques. First, HRP
conjugated anti-human IgG (polyspecific) was used as a secondary
antibody but this produced a high background signals. Since it was
reported that autoantibodies in IMN predominantly belong to the
IgG4 subclass, HRP conjugated anti-human IgG4 was conse￾quently used as a secondary antibody (Figure 2). This was attended
by much lower background and stronger signals (Figure S3; Table
S1) localized to seven consensus epitopes; all of which were located
in the extracellular domain of PLA2R (Figure 3). The antigen
determinants identified by epitope mapping encompassing 10 to
25 aa were localized to the C-type lectin like domains (CTLDs) of
the receptor except for one that was localized to the N-terminal
cysteine-rich region (C-R). Of the epitopes located in the CTLDs
of the receptor, one was located in CTLD1, one in CTLD2, two
were located in CTLD6 and the last two were found to be in
CTLD8 (Table 1). Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST NCBI) search and a cut-off of .80% sequence similarity,
determined that these peptides did not share sequence similarity to
or alignment with other proteins. Since no strong homology was
found using BLAST, molecular mimicry is unlikely and thus
further supports the specificity of the peptides. In order to verify
the reactivity of the identified epitopes in a diagnostic immuno￾assay, synthetic peptides were tested by ELISA and ALBIA.
Although the absorbance or fluorescence units of positive samples
were higher than negative or control samples, these differences
were not significant (Figure 4; Figure S4).
In order to determine if the identified peptides could inhibit
anti-PLA2R binding to the full length chimeric PLA2R, a peptide
absorption assay was performed on anti-PLA2R positive samples
from two different patients using both the IIF-CBA and ALBIA. A
mixture of the PLA2R peptide epitopes identified by SPOT,
decreased, in a dose dependent manner, the reactivity to the full
length recombinant molecule by approximately 90% in both the
ALBIA and IIF-CBA (Figure 5). By contrast, at equivalent
concentrations the GE-1 (RCD8) peptides were significantly less
efficient in absorbing anti-PLA2R reactivity. In addition to the
peptide mixture, peptides 3 and 4 showed intermediate inhibition
of anti-PLA2R antibody reactivity.
Discussion
We have developed a new ALBIA using cell lysates that bear the
full-length recombinant human protein that reliably detects anti￾PLA2R antibodies in human IMN sera. Currently, a commercially
available immunoassay for determining anti-PLA2R antibodies is a
semi-quantitative IIF-CBA but it is not well suited to high
throughput laboratory platforms and can be troubled by subjective
interpretation.

Phospholipase A2 Receptor in Glomerulonephritis

Previous studies by Beck et al [10] found that the majority of
autoantibodies in IMN patients bind to a conformational (i.e.
discontinuous) epitope. Nevertheless, we were interested in using
SPOT technology to explore the possibility of inter-molecular
epitope spreading and also hoped to identify a peptide domain
that was major antigenic determinant on PLA2R isoform1.
SPOT technology is a powerful tool that can be used to screen
hundreds to thousands of peptides for antibody binding and has
been used successfully to identify linear epitopes with clinical
relevance [26–28]. Our SPOT data clearly indicated that the
PLA2R autoantibodies are directed against several epitopes,
although, we were unable to confirm a previously reported
epitope [3]. Unfortunately, despite strong reactivity on cellulose
membrane matrices, other immunoassays (i.e. ELISA) were
unable to conclusively distinguish between patients and normal
controls, even when the synthetic PLA2R peptides were tested
individually or in various combinations (data not shown). One
possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that smaller
peptides bound to solid phase matrices may limit autoantibody
binding by stearic hindrance.
Even though the synthetic peptides representing potential
PLA2R epitopes were not effective as analytes in our ELISA or
ALBIA platforms, the absorption experiments demonstrated that
a mixture of all peptides and to a lesser extent peptides 3 and
4, were able to inhibit binding of anti-PLA2R to the full length
chimeric protein employed in our ALBIA and to PLA2R
overexpressed in the IIF-CBA. The relative ineffectiveness of
single peptides (representing one single epitope) in completely
absorbing all anti-PLA2R reactivity was expected because our
data clearly showed that the anti-PLA2R responses encompasses
more than a single epitope. Nevertheless, marginal effectiveness
of single peptides observed for peptides 3 and 4 is of interest
and merits further study. It is important to appreciate that the
same dynamics cannot be expected for every anti-PLA2R serum
because of the possibility of any number of combinations or
permutations of epitopes that would be targeted. It is important
to point out that reactivity in the IIF-CBA, which is thought to
primarily represent a conformation-dependent immunoassay,
was also significantly absorbed by the peptide mixture indicating
that even in this assay the epitopes available for antibody
binding are quite diverse. In addition to the ALBIA and IIF￾CBA, we are anxious to collaborate and determine if similar
effects are observed in ELISAs that have been developed
[12,22].
Our observations that anti-PLA2R antibodies recognize
shorter peptide domains and also absorb anti-PLA2R reactivity
but fail to bind to the full-length protein in immunoblot
experiments is consistent with previous findings in other
autoantibody systems. For example, some autoepitopes represent
cryptic epitopes that become accessible only after certain
conformational changes, a feature demonstrated for beta 2
glycoprotein 1 [29–31]. Whether the identified PLA2R epitopes
contribute to the pathophysiology of IMN remains speculative
and requires further research. In addition, it is often assumed

higher than values of anti-PLA2R negative samples and of controls (p￾values,0.0001). [Median with interquartile range]. Panel B: ALBIA
readings were analyzed according to antibody titres determined on CB￾IIF. Samples with a high titre on CB-IIF had often a high fluorescent
value on the bead-based assay but ALBIA readings did not correlate
with CB-IIF titres. [Whiskers: 2.5–97.5 percentile]. Panel C: A ROC curve is
a graphical plot illustrating the performance of a binary classifier system
and is used to evaluate diagnostic tests. Sensitivity (fraction of true
positives out of positives) is plotted versus 1-specificity (the fraction of
false positives out of negatives). Here, our established ALBIA using HEK
cell lysates is compared to the EUROIMMUN IIF-CBA. The EUROIMMU￾NIIF-CBA is a commercially available immunoassay for anti-PLA2R and
therefore defined the outcome (anti-PLA2R positive vs. anti-PLA2R
negative).Thus, the IIF-CBA perfectly classifies patients with high
sensitivity and specificity. With an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.978, the ALBIA is very close to the CB-IIF assay.

Figure 2. Epitope Mapping of PLA2R Peptides with anti-human IgG4. Grey scale heat map representation of results from SPOT used to detect
PLA2R epitopes. Peptide membranes were probed with 10 randomly selected IMN samples that had previously been tested by IIF-CBA for anti-PLA2R
antibodies (7 positive (IMN+) and 3 negative (IMN-)), as well as 5 normal healthy controls (NHC). The positive control rabbit antibody to PLA2R reacted
with the expected peptide used as the immunogen. Consensus epitopes and their respective PLA2R domains derived from this analysis are illustrated
in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1.

that short peptides do not bear conformational epitopes, a
concept that does not take into consideration that protein
folding and conformation (i.e. helices) can be present as part of
natural physicochemical interactions of the constituent amino
acids thereby providing continuous conformational epitopes. In
addition, it is important to appreciate that even when proteins
are ‘‘denatured’’ using various chemical modalities (i.e. mer￾captoethanol, dithiothreitol, or SDS) that transfer from SDS
polyacrylamide gels to solid phase matrices through an alcohol
interphase can result in significant protein refolding. We
attempted to chemically reduce our full length chimeric PLA2R
to expose potentially hidden epitopes and thereby demonstrate
enhanced reactivity, but this became technically challenging as
the proteins were precipitated using this approach (data not
shown).
As noted above, instead of solely targeting a particular
conformational PLA2R epitope as reported by Beck et al [10],
human autoantibodies to PLA2R appear to target multiple
domains of the receptor, a finding that supports the phenomenon
of inter-molecular epitope spreading of B cell responses [32–34].
Epitope spreading, defined as the diversification of epitope
specificity from its initial focus, has already been described in
other autoimmune diseases such as SLE, multiple sclerosis, type-1
diabetes and myasthenia gravis [34] and is suggested to result from
tissue damage when so called cryptic (hidden or sequestered)
epitopes are exposed. However, it is also considered that epitope
spreading might play a protective role, e.g. to enhance efficiency of
tumor clearance by up-regulating immune responses or, in
contrast, to down-regulate immune responses in autoimmunity
[34]. Since we are the first to describe multiple PLA2R epitopes
that bind to IMN sera as evidence to support the concept of
epitope spreading, further studies (i.e. analysis of sequential sera)
are necessary to validate and examine the wider clinical relevance
of these observations.
In summary, we developed a new immunoassay (ALBIA) for
detecting PLA2R autoantibodies in IMN sera. We provide
evidence that binding of autoantibodies to PLA2R domains is
likely more complex than previously thought. Some of our findings
supporting earlier reports that human IMN autoantibody binding
to PLA2R depends on conformational epitopes. However, we
identified multiple different epitopes on PLA2R that bind
autoantibodies of IMN patients, a feature that supports a PLA2R
driven B cell response and B cell production involves autoanti￾bodies that demonstrate inter-molecular epitope spreading in
Figure 3. PLA2R schematic plot of the seven potential antigen determinants identified by epitope mapping. All of the determinants
identified by epitope mapping were located in the extracellular domain of PLA2R and are ,10 to 25 aa long. Only one epitope is not in the C-type
lectin like domains of the receptor. [C-R,cysteine-rich region; FNII, fibronectin type II domain; CTLDs, C-type lectin like domains; N, N-terminal end; C, C￾terminal end].

IMN. Future studies in larger patient cohorts are necessary to
validate these findings and to analyze if inter-molecular epitope
spreading and autoantibody reactivity to specific regions of the
receptor is of prognostic relevance for the affected patients.

Figure S2 ALBIA (Luminex) IgG4 compared to ALBIA
(Luminex) IgG. Panel A: Again the median of ALBIA
fluorescence units of anti-PLA2R positive samples were compared
to samples negative for anti-PLA2R antibodies and control
samples. Fluorescence values of anti-PLA2R positive samples were
significantly higher than values of anti-PLA2R negative samples
and of controls (p-values,0.0001). [Median with interquartile
range]. Panel B: ALBIA readings of samples tested with IgG4 as
secondary were also analyzed according to antibody titres
determined on CB-IIF. Like the ALBIA IgG, samples with a high
titre on CB-IIF had often a high fluorescent value on the bead￾based assay but again ALBIA readings did not correlate with CB￾IIF titres. [Whiskers: 2.5–97.5 percentile]. Panel C: This ROC
curve compares the ALBIA assay using anti-human IgG4 versus
anti-human IgG as secondary antibody. The difference between
the two assays is marginal: AUC for anti-human IgG4 is 0.963 as
opposed to 0.978 for anti-human IgG.

Figure S3 Epitope mapping. Panel A: IgG (all subclasses) as
secondary antibody. Peptide membranes were tested with 10
randomly selected samples, 3 negative and 7 positive for anti￾PLA2R antibodies as well as 5 normal healthy controls. High
background signals were observed as well as some strong dots that
varied depending on the sample and were therefore not considered
as potential epitopes. Panel B: IgG4 as secondary antibody. Peptide
membranes were also incubated with HRP conjugated anti￾human IgG4 antibody (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) as
secondary. Besides healthy controls and patient serum samples,
commercial rabbit anti-PLA2R (1:500; Abcam; Immunogen:
synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of human
PLA2R) was also tested on the membrane. Seven potential
epitopes (red boxes) were identified.

Figure 5. Illustrative Inhibition studies of anti-PLA2R antibod￾ies using synthetic peptides with an anti-PLA2R positive serum
sample. Panel A: Different concentrations of a mixture of PLA2R
derived peptides were used to inhibit the reactivity to the PLA2R whole
molecule in an addressable laser bead assay. The reactivity showed a
significant, dose dependent inhibition. The inhibition with a control
peptide (GE-1) was significantly lower. All values are expressed as
residual reactivity after inhibition (in %) compared to the sample
without inhibitor or control. Panel B: The peptide mixture together with
seven individual PLA2R peptides and a control peptide were used at a
concentration of 126 mg/mL. Besides the peptide mixture, peptide 3
and peptide 4 showed inhibition of anti-PLA2R antibodies. All values are
expressed as residual reactivity after inhibition (in %) compared to the
sample without inhibitor or control. Panel C: The peptide mixture
together with seven individual PLA2R peptides and a control peptide
were used at a concentration of 126 mg/mL. Besides the peptide
mixture, peptide 3 and peptide 4 showed inhibition of anti-PLA2R
antibodies. All values are expressed as ALBIA median fluorescence
