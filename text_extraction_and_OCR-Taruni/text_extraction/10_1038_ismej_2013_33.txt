The stomach acts as a barrier to ingested microbes, thereby influencing the microbial ecology of the
entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The stomach microbiota and the role of human host and
environmental factors, such as health status or medications, in shaping its composition remain
largely unknown. We sought to characterize the bacterial and fungal microbiota in the stomach fluid
in order to gain insights into the role of the stomach in GI homeostasis. Gastric fluid was collected
from 25 patients undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy. DNA isolates were used for PCR
amplification of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers
(ITS). RNA isolates were used for 16S rRNA cDNA generation and subsequent PCR amplification.
While all stomach fluid samples are dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes,
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria (499% of sequence reads), the transcriptionally
active microbiota shows significant reduction in Actinobacteria (34%) and increase in Campylo￾bacter (444%) (Po0.003), specifically the oral commensal and suspected intestinal pathogen
Campylobacter concisus. Bacterial but not fungal diversity is reduced by antibiotic treatment (28%;
Po0.02), immunosuppression in transplant recipients and HIV/AIDS patients (42%; Po0.001) and
gastric fluid pH 44 (70%; Po0.05). Immunosuppression correlates with decreased abundance of
Prevotella (24%), Fusobacterium (2%) and Leptotrichia (6%) and increased abundance of
Lactobacillus (3844%) (Po0.003). We have generated the first in-depth characterization of the
human gastric fluid microbiota, using bacterial 16S rRNA gene and transcript, and fungal ITS
amplicon sequencing and provide evidence for a significant impact of the host immune status on its
composition with likely consequences for human health.

Introduction
The stomach plays a crucial role in the maintenance
of gastrointestinal (GI) health, serving as a barrier
against ingested infectious disease agents of the
lower GI tract (Martinsen et al., 2005). In healthy
human subjects, inactivation of ingested pathogens
is mediated by gastric fluid containing a combina￾tion of hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes
(Tennant et al., 2008). Correspondingly, impaired
gastric acid secretion is associated with an increased
risk of infection (Howden and Hunt, 1987). Hypo￾chlorhydria can result from atrophic gastritis, gastric
surgery or drugs that inhibit acid secretion
(Martinsen et al., 2005). The gastric environment is
also subject to active control by innate and adaptive
immune responses, as has been demonstrated by a
large body of literature on Helicobacter pylori
infection (Vorobjova et al., 2008). A protective
function against pathogen infection has also been
attributed to the commensal microbiota, for exam￾ple, by providing direct protection against coloniza￾tion (Croswell et al., 2009) or by mediating clearance
(Endt et al., 2010) of invading pathogens such as

Salmonella enterica. Whether the stomach micro￾biota performs similar tasks is unknown, as the
microbial communities of the stomach have not
been studied in detail. Moreover, it has not been
shown if the gastric fluid supports an intrinsic
microbiota different from that of adjacent locations
of the GI tract, which could play a role for the
stomach barrier function. Previous work has pri￾marily focused on the microbiota of gastric mucosal
biopsies in the context of H. pylori infection and
applied only DNA-based methodologies that are
unable to distinguish between transcriptionally
active and inactive or dead bacteria (Bik et al.,
2006; Dicksved et al., 2009; Maldonado-Contreras
et al., 2010). The specific aim of this study was
therefore to characterize the microbiota of gastric
fluid, in order to test the hypothesis that complex,
transcriptionally active microbial communities exist
in this environment, to provide insights into the
colonization resistance of the stomach and reveal
which organisms are likely to enter the intestine and
thus influence the human host and microbiota in the
lower GI tract. Expanding the donor population
beyond H. pylori-infected subjects allowed for the
evaluation of the influence of multiple external or
environmental factors on the microbiota.
Towards this end, we address here the function of
the stomach environment for GI health by determin￾ing the microbiota composition of gastric fluid in
relation to various human host parameters, includ￾ing immune status, gastric fluid pH, use of proton
pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antibiotic medications.
Through deep-sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) genes and their transcripts as well as
fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), we iden￾tify a diverse and transcriptionally active microbiota
in stomach fluid that is critically shaped by the
human host immune status, with potential implica￾tions for GI and overall human health and disease.
Materials and methods
Subject enrollment and sample collection
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Maryland Baltimore; all
subjects provided their informed consent. Twenty￾five adult patients undergoing clinically indicated
upper endoscopy at the University of Maryland
Medical Center were enrolled between December
2010 and June 2011. All samples were obtained in a
hospital-based endoscopy laboratory, which oper￾ates between the hours of 0800 and 1700 hours. All
patients were required to fast for a minimum of 8 h
before the procedure. Demographics, clinical fea￾tures and endoscopic indications and findings were
recorded (Table 1). During the endoscopy, suction
was not used until the endoscope entered the
stomach to avoid contamination from other body
sites. Gastric fluid was aspirated and collected in a
sterile container. Samples were immediately put on
ice and within 2 h aliquoted (0.5 ml), combined with
RNAlater (0.5 ml; Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA)
and frozen together with remaining raw samples at
 80 1C until further processing. Sample pH was
determined using pH strips (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA).
Nucleic acid isolation
DNA and RNA were isolated separately, using single
aliquots per isolation. Samples were centrifuged at
5000 g for 8 min and the supernatant discarded. For
DNA extraction, the cell pellets were re-suspended
in 0.6 ml of 1  phosphate-buffered saline and
processed as described previously (Ravel et al.,
2011). Cell lysis was initiated with two enzymatic
incubations, first using 5 ml of lysozyme
(10 mg ml  1
; Amresco, Solon, OH, USA), 13 ml of
mutanolysin (11.7 U ml  1
; Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 ml of
lysostaphin (4.5 U ml  1
; Sigma-Aldrich) for an incu￾bation of 30 min at 37 1C and, second, using 10 ml
Proteinase K (20 mg ml  1
; Research Products Inter￾national, Mt Prospect, IL, USA), 50 ml 10% SDS and
2 ml RNase (10 mg ml  1
) for an incubation of 45 min
at 56 1C. After the enzyme treatments, cells were
disrupted by bead beating in tubes with Lysing
Matrix B (0.1 mm silica spheres, MP Biomedicals,
Solon, OH, USA), at 6 m s  1 for 40 s at room
temperature in a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals).
The resulting crude lysate was processed using the
ZR Fecal DNA mini-prep kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda￾tion. The samples were eluted with 100 ml of ultra
pure water into separate tubes. DNA concentrations
in the samples were measured using the Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RNA isolation was performed by re-suspending
pelleted cells in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) and disrupting cells by bead
beating as described above. The lysate was pro￾cessed following the manufacturer’s recommenda￾tions (Ambion) for RNA extraction with the
following changes: in the phase separation step
300 ml of chloroform was added; the RNA precipita￾tion step included 10 mg of added RNase-free
glycogen (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA); 80%
ethanol was used in RNA wash step. The RNA pellet
was re-suspended in 41 ml of diethylpyrocarbonate￾treated water (Ambion) without heated incubation.
After pellet dissolution RNA samples were treated
with 4 U DNaseI (Fermentas) and incubated for 1 h at
37 1C. DNaseI was deactivated by the addition of 3 ml
0.5 mM EDTA and incubation at 65 1C for 10 min.
Amplification and sequencing
Hypervariable regions V1–V2 of the bacterial 16S
rRNA gene were amplified with primers 27F and
338R as described previously (Ravel et al., 2011).
Fungal ITS1 regions were amplified with primers

ITS1F and ITS2 (Ghannoum et al., 2010). Additional
primer sets were evaluated, including EF4/Fung5
(Smit et al., 1999) and nu-SSU-0817-5/nu-SSU￾1196-3 (Borneman and Hartin, 2000), which gener￾ated less consistent results than ITS1F and ITS2.
Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
DNA amplification of 16S rRNA genes was
performed using AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase
High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of template
DNA in a total reaction volume of 25 ml, following
the AccuPrime product protocol. Reactions were
run in a PTC-100 thermal controller (MJ Research,
Waltham, MA, USA) using the following protocol:
3 min of denaturation at 94 1C, followed by 30 cycles
of 30 s at 94 1C (denaturation), 30 s at 52 1C (anneal￾ing) and 45 s at 68 1C (elongation), with a final
extension at 68 1C for 5 min. ITS amplicons were
amplified as follows: 2 min of denaturation at 94 1C,
followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 1C (denaturing),
30 s at 50 1C (annealing) and 1 min at 68 1C (elonga￾tion), with a final extension at 68 1C for 5 min.
A two-step protocol was used to amplify 16S
rRNA transcripts from RNA. All attempts to amplify
ITS1 transcripts from total RNA isolates remained
unsuccessful. The Phusion RT-PCR kit (Finnzymes,
Waltham, MA, USA) was used to synthesize cDNA
in a 20-ml volume with 250 ng RNA per reaction and
the 338R primer (or ITS2) following the Phusion RT
protocol. PCR amplification of the cDNA was set up
as described above, using 2 ml of the cDNA template
DNA and AccuPrime Buffer II as recommended by
the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA).
Negative controls were included for each ampli￾fication (PCR and RT-PCR) and barcoded primer
pair, including amplification without template DNA
and direct PCR amplification from RNA isolates.
The presence of amplicons was confirmed by gel
electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and staining
with ethidium bromide. PCR and RT-PCR products
were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
assay. Equimolar amounts (50 ng) of the PCR
amplicons were mixed in a single tube. Amplifica￾tion primers and reaction buffer were removed using
the AMPure Kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA)
and purified amplicon mixtures sequenced at the
Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Mary￾land, using 454 primer A and protocols recom￾mended by the manufacturer (Roche, Branford, CT,
USA). The 22 16S rRNA gene and 22 16S rRNA
transcript amplicons (454 GS FLX adaptors) were
sequenced as part of the same pool, which also
contained 34 unrelated samples, on a half plate of
the 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencer (Roche). The
nine ITS DNA-derived amplicons (454 GS XLR
adaptors) were sequenced together with 16S rRNA
amplicons from 82 unrelated samples on a half plate
of the 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencer. Raw
sequences were deposited in the Short Read Archive
Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, project
number PRJNA168662).
Sequence processing and analysis
16S rRNA sequence reads were processed with
CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011), using the automated
CloVR-16S pipeline as described in the correspond￾ing standard operating procedure (White et al.,
2011). Briefly, sequences were binned based on
sample-specific barcodes, trimmed by removal of
barcode and primer sequences and filtered for
quality, using a minimum sequence length of 100
nucleotides, a maximum homopolymer stretch of
eight base pairs, a minimum quality score of 25 and
a maximum number of ambiguous base pairs of 0.
Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) using a similarity threshold of 95%.
On average, 20.6% of 16S rRNA reads were removed
as chimeras. OTUs were classified using the RDP
Naive Bayesian Classifier (Wang et al., 2007) with a
score filtering threshold of 0.5. Rarefaction curves
were calculated based on OTU counts using the
rarefaction.single routine of the Mothur package
(Schloss et al., 2009). Hierarchical clustering was
performed using R. Differentially abundant OTUs
were determined with Metastats (White et al., 2009).
ITS amplicon sequence data were processed using
the automated CloVR-ITS pipeline (White et al.,
2013) (http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/
protocols/2597). Briefly, sequence were binned,
trimmed and filtered with QIIME (Caporaso et al.,
2010) using similar criteria as applied for the 16S
rRNA sequence analysis. Sequences were clustered at
99% similarity with UCLUST (Edgar, 2010), chimeric
clusters removed with UCHIME (mean: 0.9% of ITS
reads per sample) and non-chimeric clusters (OTUs)
taxonomically assigned based on BLASTN searches
against an ITS reference database (White et al., 2013).
Significance of phylogenetic distances (weighted
and unweighted UniFrac) between sample groups
was calculated in R, using Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests. For these calculations, phylogenetic distances
between samples assigned to the same group were
compared with those between samples from differ￾ent groups. P-values were calculated using two￾tailed tests with a 5% significance level. Figures
were generated by plotting the average distance
between samples within the indicated group sub￾tracted from the average distance between samples
from the two compared groups.
Phylogenetic trees were created with FastTree2
(Price et al., 2010) using trimmed alignments
generated with NAST (DeSantis et al., 2006), in
case of 16S rRNA reads or Muscle (Edgar, 2004), in
case of ITS reads. See Supplementary Figure legends
for more details.

sequencing (Table 1). Of the 25 patients, 15 were
analyzed by high-coverage (HC) amplicon sequen￾cing with between 4809 and 19 589 sequence reads
per data set (Table 2). Additional data sets from
these and the remaining patients comprised
between 138 and 548 reads per sample. HC data
and rarefied low-coverage (LC) data, generated from
all data sets subsampled to 250 reads per sample
were analyzed separately.
Sample pH values varied between 1.0 and 8.5
(mean: 4.3; Table 1). While, on average, pH values
were higher in samples from PPI-treated (pH: 4.9)
compared with all other patients (pH: 3.4), this
correlation was not significant (P-value, Student’s t￾test: 0.13). All samples, irrespective of human host
backgrounds, were found to harbor diverse micro￾bial communities (Figure 1). For the 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequence data, HC samples contained
between 26 and 358 OTUs (mean: 183) and LC
samples between eight and 56 OTUs (mean: 36) per
sample (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). On
average, HC samples were dominated by members of
the phyla Firmicutes (51.3%), Bacteroidetes (26.4%)
and Actinobacteria (10.7%) (Figure 2a). Other
prominent phyla included Proteobacteria (6.9%)
and Fusobacteria (4.3%). Five samples were found
to contain H. pylori, testing positive by either
H. pylori-specific glmM PCR assay (Lu et al., 1999)
or 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Table 1).
Alignment of the 16S rRNA reads from the two HC
samples identified one H. pylori genotype per
patient. H. pylori was not a dominant species within
the gastric fluid microbiota, accounting for o0.4%
of all sequence reads in all five patient samples
where it was present. Presence of H. pylori was not
associated with significant differences in microbiota
diversity (Figures 1a and b) or high or low sample
pH (Table 1).

environment, 16S rRNA transcript amplicon
sequence data were generated and compared with
those from the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence
data. For the 16S rRNA transcript analysis, total
RNA isolates were used as templates for cDNA
amplification with a reverse transcriptase polymer￾ase and the 338R primer. PCR products were
amplified from the cDNA with the same primers
(27F and 338R) and sequence processing conditions
as for the DNA-based 16S rRNA analysis. The
rationale behind this approach is that 16S rRNA
transcripts should be less stable under conditions
detrimental for the bacterial host than 16S rRNA
genes. Between 11 660 and 14 445 sequence reads
were obtained from the 16S rRNA transcript analy￾sis for five HC samples and between 110 and 513

sequence reads were obtained for 17 LC samples
(Table 2).
Phylogenetic distance calculations using
weighted but not unweighted UniFrac analysis
showed significant differences between 16S rRNA
gene and transcript data (see Supplementary
Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 3). In addition, consistent
shifts in relative distributions of the main taxonomic
phyla were apparent in the comparison of 16S rRNA
transcript and gene-based amplicon sequence data
(Figure 2b), including a decrease in Actinobacteria
and Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes and
Proteobacteria. Due to limited numbers of sample
pairs, these observations could not be supported
statistically based on HC sequence data. However,
significant changes between DNA and RNA-based
microbiota compositions confirming several of these
observations were identified using the larger LC
sample group (Figure 4a). Compared with the total
microbiota, the transcript-based microbiota fraction
shows a statistically significant (Po0.003) reduction
in the class Actinobacteriia (34%; phylum: Actino￾bacteria), and an increase in the genera Campylo￾bacter (444%; phylum: Proteobacteria) and
Tannerella (680%; phylum Bacteroidetes). Of the
Campylobacter reads, 490% were assigned to a
single species, Campylobacter concisus, based on
sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree predic￾tions (see Supplementary Figure 1). C. concisus is a
known oral commensal bacterium, which has also
been isolated from human feces (Van Etterijck et al.,
1996). Members of the class Actinobacteriia, which
had a lower relative abundance in 16S rRNA
transcripts compared with genes, included known
habitants of the oral cavity, such as Rothia dentocar￾iosa (Brown et al., 1969) (on average 64% of
Actinobacteriia) and Actinomyces odontolyticus
(Batty, 1958) (on average 17% of Actinobacteriia).

In the two HC samples that contained H. pylori
(#34, #44), the relative abundance of H. pylori was,
on average, 19.9 times higher in 16S rRNA tran￾scripts compared with genes.
Impact of host immune status and pH on gastric
microbiota
The 15 gastric fluid samples from the HC sample
group could be divided into two subsets, based on
microbiota species richness (Figure 1a) and compo￾sition (Figure 5), which coincided best with differ￾ences in the human host immune status. The
distinction of a sample subset from immunocom￾promised patients could be confirmed using phylo￾genetic distance (weighted and unweighted UniFrac
analysis) calculations (Figures 3 and 6;
Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Two samples from
this immunocompromised patient group originated
from HIV/AIDS patients and three from kidney
transplant recipients who were taking immunosup￾pressive medication at the time of sample collection
(Table 1), including MMF (mycophenolate mofetil),
which affects B and T lymphocyte proliferation
(Villarroel et al., 2009). Among these five immuno￾compromised patient samples, there was a signifi￾cant overlap (three out of five samples) with patients
who had taken antibiotics around the time of sample
collection (Figure 1a). All immunocompromised
patient samples had pH values 45 (mean: 6.9). PPI
usage, when controlled for immunosuppression did
not show a comparable impact on microbiota
richness (data not shown) or composition (Figures
3 and 5; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Significant
differences in phylogenetic distance (weighted and
unweighted UniFrac) were also measured between
samples with low pH (1.0–4.0) and high pH (4.0–8.5),
even when controlled for immunosuppression
(Figure 3; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5; Supple￾mentary Figure 2).
On average, bacterial richness in the five immuno￾compromised samples from transplant recipients
and HIV/AIDS patients was reduced (42%;
Po0.001) compared with all other HC samples,
measured by comparing the mean counts of OTUs
per 2500 sequence reads. Statistically significant
changes (Po0.003) in the microbiota composition
between these two groups included, at the phylum
level, increased abundances of Firmicutes (221%)
and reduced abundances of Bacteroidetes (15%),
and, at the genus level, increased Lactobacillus spp.
(3084%) and reduced Fusobacterium spp. (1%) and
Prevotella spp. (16%) (Figure 4b). The Lactobacillus
populations from the immunocompromised patient
samples showed heterogeneous compositions,
including members from different taxonomic spe￾cies, as predicted by 16S rRNA sequence alignments
and phylogenetic tree predictions (see
Supplementary Figure 3).
Although not significant, similar trends were
identified when comparing the 23 LC 16S rRNA
gene samples, that is, lower bacterial species
richness (75%; Po0.2) and different microbiota
composition in immunocompromised patient sam￾ples (Figure 1b). In addition, similar microbiota
changes were found associated with immunocom￾promised patient samples from the HC and LC
sample groups (Figure 4c), including increased
abundance of the phylum Firmicutes (193%) and
reduced abundance of Fusobacteria (4%). Among

the LC samples, a stronger correlation between
antibiotic treatment and reduced bacterial species
richness (45%; Po0.001) was apparent than among
the HC samples. In contrast to the HC samples,
where no significant microbiota changes were
found to correlate with antibiotic medication,
several taxonomic groups are reduced in the LC
samples from antibiotic-treated patients (Figure 4d),
including the genus Prevotella (17%; phylum:
Bacteroidetes), the family Fusobacteriaceae (7%;
phylum: Fusobacteria) and the order Clostridiales
(7%; phylum: Firmicutes). High pH was not
associated with significant reductions in bacterial
diversity (81%; Po0.2) or changes in the microbiota
composition, except for an increase in members
of the family Veillonellaceae (201%; phylum:
Firmicutes).

a subset of nine randomly chosen samples, sequenced
and processed using a similar methodology as for the
16S rRNA-based microbiota analysis (White et al.,
2013) (see Supplementary Table 6). After sequence
binning, trimming and filtering between 5766 and
19 589 reads were obtained per sample and assigned to
taxonomic lineages (Table 2). Samples contained
between 19 and 81 genus-level OTUs. On average,
77.5% of ITS reads could not be taxonomically
assigned, even at the phylum level, most likely due
to incomplete representation of human-associated
fungi in available ITS reference sequence collections
(White et al., 2013). Candida was one of the only two
genera found in all samples, the other being Phiale￾monium. The known pathogens C. albicans,
C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were identified based
on phylogenetic tree predictions using publicly avail￾able Candida reference sequences (see Supplementary
Figure 4). A correlation between human host immune
status and fungal microbiota richness and/or composi￾tion was not found (Figure 1c; Supplementary Table 6).
However, one of the two HIV/AIDS patients (#96) who
was treated prophylactically against Pneumocystis
pneumonia (PCP) with the tetrahydrofolate synthesis
inhibitor trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and also took
the macrolide azithromycin showed markedly reduced
fungal microbiota richness (Figure 1c).
Discussion
Our results reveal that human gastric fluid harbors a
diverse microbiota dominated by Actinobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteo￾bacteria, demonstrating a similar overall composi￾tion at the phylum level as previously found in other
GI tract locations, including intraoral niches (Zaura
et al., 2009; Crielaard et al., 2011), throat (Andersson
et al., 2008), distal esophagus (Pei et al., 2004),
stomach mucosa (Bik et al., 2006; Andersson et al.,
2008) and feces (Costello et al., 2009). Fungal
members of the microbiota are also identified,
including the known pathogen C. albicans. Contrary
to previous reports that studied the stomach envir￾onment based on biopsy samples from the mucosa
(Bik et al., 2006; Andersson et al., 2008), H. pylori, if
present, is not a dominant species within the gastric
fluid microbiota of patients with an indication for
upper endoscopy, a finding consistent with the
literature showing that H. pylori colonizes the
mucous layer and adheres to gastric epithelial cells
(Amieva and El-Omar, 2008).
Using a 16S rRNA transcript amplicon sequencing
strategy, significant differences are identified
between the total (DNA) and transcriptionally active
(RNA) microbiota. A similar approach was first
applied by Zoetendal et al. (1998) to study fecal
microbiota compositions (Zoetendal et al., 1998).
Peris-Bondia et al. (2011) used flow cytometry to
sort cells based on total RNA content before
performing 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing
and reported decreases in Bacteroidetes and
increases in specific families of the Clostridiales
(Firmicutes) from fecal samples (Peris-Bondia et al.,
2011). Typical bacterial inhabitants of the oral cavity

Stomach fluid microbiota

R. dentocariosa (Brown et al., 1969) and A.
odontolyticus (Batty, 1958), are reduced in 16S
rRNA transcript fractions of the stomach fluid
samples, supporting the utility of this method for
characterization of the metabolically active gastric
fluid microbiota. This characterization could have
important implications for intestinal health, as only
microbes that survive passage through the stomach
are able to enter the lower GI tract and play a role in
intestinal host/microbe homeostasis. Stomach fluid
is typically believed to represent a harsh environ￾ment for bacterial growth due to low-pH acidic
conditions, although our data indicate large varia￾tions in actual stomach fluid pH values, and
increases in gastric pH after meals have been
reported (Gardner et al., 2002). The identification
of transcriptionally active C. concisus, a known oral
commensal and intestinal pathogen with a sus￾pected role in Crohn’s disease (Man et al., 2010;
Hess et al., 2012), represents an example of a
microbial organism that could be important for
intestinal disease but would not draw attention
with traditional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequen￾cing-based techniques, due to the low relative
abundance. It should be noted that C. concisus has
been especially associated with intestinal patho￾genicity in immunocompromised patients
(Aabenhus et al., 2002) and that, among the five
HC patient samples, the relative increase in
C. concisus concentrations in RNA versus DNA
isolates was even more pronounced in the single
immunocompromised patient (#34) compared with
the four other samples (1254% and 630%, respec￾tively). In addition, all immunocompromised
patient samples showed pH values above 6.0.
Whether immunosuppression influences the barrier
function of the stomach for intestinal pathogens
needs to be further addressed in future studies.
The human host is suspected to play a major role
in shaping the gastric fluid microbiota, in terms of
both diversity and composition. Our results suggest
that immune status is the most important determi￾nant of gastric fluid microbiota, although antibiotic
medication, which is often required in immuno￾compromised patients, and high gastric fluid pH,
which can be caused by H. pylori infection and PPI
usage among other factors, also seem to affect the
microbiota diversity and composition. This is
surprising since, unlike the small and large intes￾tine, the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa
typically lacks organized and diffuse lymphoid
tissue. Immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients
and transplant recipients show markedly reduced
diversity as well as altered composition of
their gastric fluid microbiota. The effect of immu￾nosuppressive medication on the microbiota
appears restricted to transplant recipients, all of
which were taking MMF and glucocorticoids at the
time of sample collection. In contrast, a sample from
a patient with sarcoidosis (#52), treated at the time
of enrollment with a low dose (5 mg prednisone
daily) of glucocorticoids alone, did not show
characteristics similar to the HIV/AIDS patient and
transplant recipient samples. MMF, an inhibitor of
purine biosynthesis, affects T and B lymphocyte
proliferation and is known to cause GI adverse side
effects (Villarroel et al., 2009). Glucocorticoids exert
anti-inflammatory effects through multiple often
immune cell-specific mechanisms, including sup￾pression of pro-inflammatory T cells and stimula￾tion of regulatory T cells (Zen et al., 2011).
Similarities between the histological effects of GI
toxicity induced by MMF and acute GVHD (graft￾versus-host-disease) affecting the GI tract as well as
HIV/AIDS have been pointed out before
(Papadimitriou et al., 2003). While the disease state
of HIV/AIDS patients was not recorded as part of
this study, CD4 þ T-cell depletion of GALT (gut￾associated lymphoid tissue) is an early event in the
pathogenesis of human HIV infection and restora￾tion is delayed even after highly active antiretroviral
therapy (Guadalupe et al., 2003). GALT harbors the
majority of T lymphocytes in the human body
(Nannini and Okhuysen, 2002), further suggesting
that the T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response
could be responsible for the observed microbiota
changes in transplant recipients and HIV/AIDS
patients samples and could be important for host￾controlled GI tract homeostasis.
Similarities in infectious and other complications,
especially of the GI tract, between HIV/AIDS
patients and transplant recipients have been pre￾viously described (Thom and Forrest, 2006). Our
observations of the gastric fluid microbiota in this
patient group provide the opportunity for identify￾ing potential microbiota-associated causes of dis￾ease. For example, the observed increase in
Lactobacillus spp. seen in immunocompromised
patients could be responsible for an increased risk of
Lactobacillus bacteremia, which is rare in immuno￾competent patients but has been reported in HIV/AIDS
patients (Horwitch et al., 1995) and organ transplant
recipients (Patel et al., 1994). Furthermore, Jenq et al.
(2012) recently described changes in the microbiota of
human and mouse bone marrow transplant recipients
similar to those reported here, namely reduced
diversity and increases in Lactobacillales in feces
(humans) and ileum and cecum (mouse) (Jenq et al.,
2012). In the mouse model, the authors could also
demonstrate a protective effect of Lactobacillus species
against GVHD, a common complication of bone
marrow transplantation, highlighting the potential
therapeutic implications of the observed microbiota
changes for the development of future pro- or antibiotic
treatments.
Prior work suggests that acid-suppressing medica￾tions increase the risk of enteric infections (Leonard
et al., 2007) and the prevalence of non-H. pylori
bacteria in gastric fluid (Sanduleanu et al., 2001).
Surprisingly, while high gastric fluid pH was
associated with significant microbiota changes, our
study did not detect a statistically significant

correlation between acid-suppressing medications
and high gastric fluid pH (P-value: 0.13) or a direct
impact of these medications on microbiota richness
or composition. Larger studies will be needed before
any conclusions can be drawn.
The present work has limitations. First, while care
was taken to avoid aspiration of oropharyngeal and
esophageal secretions, samples could have been
contaminated from these areas, as the endoscope
passed from the mouth to the stomach. In addition,
while endoscopes undergo high-level disinfection
before every use, they are not sterile. Sample storage
conditions (Lauber et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010) and
DNA extraction methods (Maukonen et al., 2012), as
well as 16S rRNA gene amplification primers (Wu
et al., 2010) and biases inherent in PCR amplifica￾tion, have all been shown to influence the results of
microbiota analyses. PCR replicates were not per￾formed. Therefore, the true composition of the gastric
fluid microbiota remains unknown and could be
different from the one reported here. However, the
main results presented in this study should not have
been affected by potential biases, as they were based
on the comparison of samples collected and processed
under similar conditions. Similarly, while 16S rRNA
transcript analysis suggests the presence of a metabo￾lically active microbiota in the stomach fluid, it does
not answer the question whether an intrinsic micro￾biota that is native to the gastric fluid environment
exists, or whether extrinsic microbes were detected
from other environments, which are merely adapted to
persist in this environment.
In conclusion, this study provides the identifica￾tion and first in-depth characterization of microbial
communities from the gastric fluid environment of
the stomach. With 16S rRNA transcript sequence
analysis, a methodology is presented for identifica￾tion of the transcriptionally active component of the
total stomach fluid microbiota. The results pre￾sented here demonstrate the existence of a gastric
fluid microbiota, which contains fungi and is
significantly influenced by the immune status and
antibiotic regimen of the human host. These find￾ings imply an important function of these factors for
human GI health and could lead to the development
of new therapeutic strategies with potential to
improve GI health that may be particularly relevant
to immunocompromised patients.
