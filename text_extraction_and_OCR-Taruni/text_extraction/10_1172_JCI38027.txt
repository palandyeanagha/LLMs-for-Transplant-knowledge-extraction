Muscle fiber deterioration resulting in progressive skeletal muscle weakness, heartfailure, and respiratory distress
occurs in more than 20 inherited myopathies. As discussed in this Review, one ofthe newly identified myopathies is
desminopathy, a disease caused by dysfunctional mutations in desmin, a type III intermediate filament protein, or
αB-crystallin, a chaperone for desmin. The range of clinical manifestations in patients with desminopathy is wide
and may overlap with those observed in individuals with other myopathies. Awareness of this disease needs to be
heightened, diagnostic criteria reliably outlined, and molecular testing readily available; this would ensure preven￾tion of sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
Background
Desminopathy was originally described as skeletal and cardiac
myopathy characterized by bilateral weaknessin distal leg muscles
spreading proximally and leading eventually to tetraparesis and
wheelchair dependence (1). Weakness sometimes involves trunk,
neck flexors, and facial muscles. In disease variants marked with
early onset cardiomyopathy, patients experience dizziness and
syncopal and fainting episodes associated with conduction blocks
and require insertion of a permanent pacemaker(1, 2). Respiratory
muscle weakness is a frequent component of desminopathy.
Desminopathy belongsto a geneticallyheterogeneous group of dis￾ordersnamedmyofibrillarmyopathies,whichare causedbymutations
inthe following genes: desmin(DES),αB-crystallin(CRYAB), myotilin
(MYOT),Zband alternatively spliced PDZ-containing protein (ZASP),
filaminC(FLNC), orBcl-2–associatedathanogene-3 (BAG3)(2, 3).The
common pathological pattern in myofibrillar myopathy is dissolu￾tion of myofibrils, aggregation of degraded myofibrillar products,
and ectopic expression of proteins(2), but clinical manifestations are
remarkably different. In this Review we discuss myofibrillar myopa￾thies associatedwith mutationsin DES (4, 5) and CRYAB (6).
Desmin isthe main intermediate filament(IF) protein expressed in
cardiac,skeletal, and smooth muscle.Itinteractswith other proteins
to form a continuous cytoskeletal network that maintains a spatial
relationship between the contractile apparatus and other structural
elements ofthe cell,thus providing maintenance of cellularintegrity,
force transmission, and mechanochemicalsignaling (Figure 1). Des￾min is much more abundant in heart muscle (2% of total protein)
than in skeletal muscle (0.35%) and is a major component of Purkinje
fibers,the specialized myocardial conduction system that enablesthe
heartto contractin a coordinated fashion (7). αB-crystallin serves as
a chaperone for desmin and other proteins, preventing them from
aggregating under variousforms ofstress(8).
Desmin mutations and their structural consequences
Human desmin is encoded by a single-copy gene (DES) located
on chromosome 2q35 (9). DES encompasses nine exons within an
8.4-kb region and encodes 470 amino acids(10). The gene is highly
conserved among vertebrate species. In accordance with its func￾tion, desmin is organized into three domains — a highly conserved
α-helical core of 308 amino acid residues flanked by globular
N- and C-terminal structures (known as the “head” and “tail”
domains, respectively) (11). The α-helical core maintains a seven￾residue (heptad) repeat pattern that guides two polypeptides to
form a homopolymeric coiled-coil dimer, the elementary unit of
the desmin IF; the heptad periodicity within the helical rod is
interrupted in several places, resulting in four consecutive heli￾cal segments (known as 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) connected by short,
nonhelical linkers (12).
Thus far, the number of known disease-causing DES mutations
has reached 45 (Figure 2): 40 are missense mutations, 3 are small
in-frame deletions of between one and seven amino acids, 1 is an
exon-skipping mutation, and 1 is an insertion of a single nucleo￾tide resulting in premature translation termination. Thirteen of
the mutations are recurrent, appearing in more than one unrelated
family. Five mutations are in the head domain, one is in the 1A
helical segment, five are in the 1B segment, 23 reside in the 2B
helicalsegment, and 11 are in the tail domain. No mutations have
thus far been identified in the 2A helical segment.
The exon-skipping mutation is caused by a series of alterations
in the highly conserved intronic donor and acceptor splice sites
flanking exon 3 and results in exon 3 deletion (13). Binding sites
to nebulin (14) and perhaps otherinteracting proteins are encoded
within this exon. The heterozygous single-nucleotide (adenine)
insertion mutation occurs at the third position of codon 241 and
results in a frameshift leading to serial amino acid replacements
and eventually a premature termination signal at codon 245; this
mutation is predicted to create a truncated desmin molecule with
a molecular weight of 27 kDa (15).
Analysis of the 2B helical segment has attracted maximal atten￾tion because most of the known DES mutations occur in the por￾tion of the gene that encodesthisregion. Eleven of the 23 missense
mutationsfound in the 2B helicalsegment introduce proline. Pro￾line is not normally present in the desmin helicalrod and is known
to be a potent helix breaker; its dihedral angle is fixed at –65°,
creating a kink in the protein structure (16). In addition, proline
destabilizes α-helices by its inability to form hydrogen bonds. In
mutagenesis experiments, the introduction of proline residues

into desmin resulted in the generation of short, thick, and kinked
abnormally assembled filaments (17).
The C-terminal part of the desmin α-helical core domain con￾tains a discontinuity in the heptad repeat pattern, a “stutter” (Fig￾ure 2), which is equivalent to an insertion of four extra residues at
the end of the eighth heptad of the 2B helical segment (18). The
stutter is an obligatory feature of all IF proteins, and its position
is absolutely conserved (19, 20). As a compensation for the stutter,
the coiled coil slightly unwinds in the vicinity of the stutter. Four
known mutations (p.Arg355Pro, p.Ala357Pro, p.Ala360Pro, and
p.Glu359_Ser361del) occur within the stutter or in the immedi￾ate neighborhood. Molecular modeling of p.Glu359_Ser361del
indicates that it creates a second stutter adjacent to the normally
existing one, causing additional local unwinding of the coiled coil
(21). The p.Asn366del mutation converts the stutter into a hep￾tad repeat stammer, which leads to overwinding of the coiled coil;
both mutations are thus expected to result in altered coiled-coil
geometry within the 2B helical segment (21).
Another thoroughly examined desmin
structural element is the YRKLLEGEESRI
motif,positionedattheC-terminal endofthe
2B helical segment (Figure 2). Starting with
several amino acids preceding the YRKLLE￾GEESRI motif and through the YRKLL
peptide,the coiled-coilstructure loosens and
the α-helices gradually separate, eventually
bending away from each other at EGEE (22).
Two well-studied mutations (p.Arg406Trp
and p.Glu413Lys) are located within this
structure, and two other mutations reside
in the preceding sequence (p.Asp399Tyr
and p.Glu401Lys). These mutations dam￾age structural and functional relationships.
The p.Arg406Trp mutation replaces argi￾nine with a larger tryptophan residue, mak￾ing the helix at least a half turn longer and
thereby changing the peptide structure and
symmetry (23, 24). Filament assembly stud￾ies indicate that the p.Arg406Trp mutant
has a reduced ability to support longitudi￾nal annealing as well as radial compaction
(25). The p.Asp399Tyr, p.Glu401Lys, and
p.Arg406Trp mutations disrupt potentially critical intrahelical and
interhelical salt-bridge interactions within desmin dimers (23), and
the p.Glu413Lys mutation alters electrostatic interactions that are
important for proper dimer-dimer assembly (26).
As noted above, eleven disease-causing mutations are located
within the 61–amino acid–residue tail domain of desmin.Although
the tail lacks heptad repeats, it regulates longitudinal head-to-tail
tetramer assembly and controls lateral packing, stabilization, and
elongation of the higher orderfilamentstructures(27–29). Assem￾bly studies have shown that some tail mutants form less compact
filaments with highly irregular diameters and exert dominant￾negative effects when mixed with wild-type desmin (30). The tail
domain is also involved in interactions between desmin and other
cytoskeletal proteins (29).
αB-crystallin mutations
αB-crystallin belongs to the small heat shock protein family of
chaperones, which includes hsp20, hsp22, hspB2, hspB3, hsp25,
Figure 1
Molecular cytoarchitecture of a myocyte, fea￾turing proteins involved in skeletal and cardiac 
myopathies. Desmin is the main muscle IF pro￾tein. It interacts with other proteins to support 
myofibrils at the level of the Z disc and forms 
a continuous cytoskeletal IF network that main￾tains a spatial relationship between the contrac￾tile apparatus and other structural elements of 
the cell. Desmin provides maintenance of cel￾lular integrity, force transmission, and mecha￾nochemical signaling. Mutations in other sarco￾meric and cytoskeletal proteins (plectin, myotilin, 
filamin C, αB-crystallin, Z band alternatively 
spliced PDZ-motif protein [ZASP], and BCL2-
associated athanogene 3 [BAG3]) cause neu￾romuscular disorders. Adapted with permission

hsp27, and myotonic dystrophy kinase–binding protein. Although
originally classified as a lens protein (31), αB-crystallin is abun￾dant in cardiac and skeletal muscle (32). Chaperones respond to
stressful conditions by binding to unfolded proteins, preventing
their denaturation and aggregation (8, 33). By acting as a chap￾erone for desmin and cytoplasmic actin, αB-crystallin helps to
maintain cytoskeletal integrity (34). αB-crystallin also participates
in a number of other cellular processes, including compartment
targeting, degradation, and signaling. A heterozygous CRYAB
p.Arg120Gly mutation has been identified in a multigenerational
French family with phenotypic characteristics of desminopathy (6,
35). The Arg120 residue is located in the region of αB-crystallin
that is conserved among the small heat shock proteins. Structural
and functional studies indicate that the mutant αB-crystallin has
a diminished chaperone function (36, 37). Two other mutations,
c.464_465CTdel and p.Gln151X, both resulting in a truncated
αB-crystallin, have also been identified as the cause of a disease
with phenotypic characteristics of myofibrillar myopathy (38).
Molecular pathogenesis
Identification of pathogenic mutationsin desmin andαB-crystallin,
analysis of underlying disease phenotypes, and successful modeling
of underlying conditions in cell cultures and transgenic mice has
helped to understand critical pathogenic eventsin desminopathies.
Animal models. Studies of DES-knockout mice have shown that,
although they develop normally and are fertile, lack of a desmin
IF network prevents spatial organization of cellular components
(39–42). Abnormalities include loss of the lateral alignment of
myofibrils, perturbation of myofibril anchorage to the sarcolemma
and nuclear matrix, loss of nuclearshape and positioning,swollen
mitochondria, and unusual distribution of myosins (40, 41).
After birth, irregularitiesin myofibrillar organization are predomi￾nantly observed inweight-bearing musclessuchasM.soleus(the calf)
and continually and extensively used muscles such as the tongue,
diaphragm, and heart (39, 40, 42). Mitochondria increase in size and
number, lose correct positioning, and eventually degenerate (41).
Older animals show characteristic morphology of skeletal muscle
dystrophy (40). Cardiac muscle is mostsusceptible to the lack of des￾min; early in postnatal life, mice develop cardiomyopathy manifest by
lysis of individual cardiomyocytes, invasion of macrophages, varying
degrees of calcification, and finally fibrosis(41, 42).Disorganized, dis￾tended, and nonaligned fibers are observed in the diaphragm (41).

mutation that is associated with desminopathy in humans, exami￾Figure 2
Updated chart of desmin mutations. Top: Desmin is composed of an α-helical rod containing 303 amino acid residues, flanked by globular N- and 
C-terminal structures (known as the head and tail domains, respectively). The rod is interrupted in several places, resulting in four consecutive 
α-helical segments, 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, connected by short, nonhelical linkers. Helical segment 2B contains a discontinuity in the heptad repeat 
pattern (known as a stutter) and an YRKLLEGEE motif (red boxes within the protein structure). Most pathogenic desmin mutations reside within 
either the 2B helical segment or the tail. Bottom: Molecular model of desmin coiled-coil segment based on analogy with crystallographic data for 
human vimentin. The stutter is a discontinuity in the heptad repeat pattern equivalent to an insertion of four extra residues, an absolutely con￾served feature of all IF proteins. Starting with several amino acids preceding the YR motif and through the YR peptide, the coiled-coil structure 
loosens and the monomers gradually separate, eventually bending away from each other. The angles and distances between residue positions in 
the 2B C-terminal helical segment are shown. The bottom portion has been adapted with permission from Journal of Molecular Biology (22).

nation of the myocardium revealed an accumulation of chimeric
intracellular aggregates containing desmin and other cytoskeletal
proteins(43). Such aggregates are notseen in DES-knockout mice,
supporting the hypothesisthat mutant misfolded desmin protein
acts as a seed for the formation of protein inclusionsin desminop￾athy. The aggregates disrupt the continuity and overall organiza￾tion of the desmin network throughout the cell (43). They appear
as electron-dense granulofilamentous structures proximal to the
nucleus and throughout the intermyofibrillarspace. In transgenic
mice carrying the desminopathy-causing human p.Leu345Pro
mutation, there is a striking abnormality of mitochondrial mor￾phology and Ca2+ handling, suggesting that the mutation under￾mines mitochondrial integrity in muscle cells (44).
Chaperones assist normal protein folding and enhance ubiqui￾tination and proteasomal degradation of abnormally constructed
proteins; they also help to restore proteins to their native confor￾mation after these proteins have been misfolded by heat, isch￾emia, chemotoxicity, or other cellular stresses (36). Expressed in
SW13 and BHK21 cells,the desminopathy-associated p.Arg120Gly
αB-crystallin mutation causes the formation of abnormal
intracellular aggregates that contain both desmin and αB-crystal￾lin (6). Transgenic mice expressing this mutation show an accumu￾lation of abnormal desmin and αB-crystallin–reactive aggregates
in cardiomyocytes (45, 46). A chaperone assay has been used to
demonstrate that the p.Arg120Gly mutant αB-crystallin is func￾tionally deficient (47). Addition of either wild-type αB-crystallin or
HSP27 to the system prevents the formation of aggregates (37).
Filament assembly assays.Analysis of filament assembly behavior by
individual desmin mutantsin in vitro experiments(48) and various
cell lines (49) has demonstrated that some mutants allow filament
formation to take place (p.Ala213Val, p.Glu245Asp, p.Ala360Pro,
p.Glu389Pro, p.Asn393Ile, and p.Asp399Tyr) but change the
number of subunits per cross-section as compared with wild-type
desmin (50). Other mutants interfere with the assembly process
and, according to the observed patterns, can be classified into
three groups: mutations compromising longitudinal annealing
properties and forming short, segmented filaments (p.Leu385Pro
and p.Arg406Trp); mutants causing enhanced adhesiveness,
which leads to filament aggregation (p.Ala337Pro, p.Asn342Pro,
and p.Ala357Pro); and mutants that facilitate rapid disintegra￾tion of assembly precursors and form aggregates (p.Leu345Pro,
p.Arg350Pro, and p.Leu370Pro) (50). Filamentformation by assem￾bly-deficient mutant desmin can be rescued in some cases by wild￾type desmin (25). In many other cases, however,the mutant protein
drives the wild-type protein into abnormal aggregates (30).
Cell transfection studies. The effects caused by desmin mutations
have also been evaluated in two types of cells. SW13(vim–), which
is a human epithelial cell line that does not express type III IF pro￾teins, is ideal for assessing the ability of mutant desmin to produce
a filamentous network by itself (17). C2C12 cells, which are mouse
myoblasts, and other cellsthat express muscle-specific endogenous
type IIIIF proteins allowevaluation ofthe effects desmin mutations
may exert on a preexisting filamentous network (23). Experimentally
induced (17) and most naturally occurring human desmin mutants
(49) are unable to generate their own IF network and frequently dis￾rupt the preexisting endogenousIF network (Figure 3).
Aggregate-eliminating pathways. Misfolded desmin molecules
escape proteolytic breakdown and attract other cytoskeletal and
ectopic proteins into high-molecular-weight insoluble chimeric
aggregates (51). Overexpression of mutant desmin in cultured
cardiac myocytes (52) and transgenic mice (53) inhibits the ubiq￾uitin-proteasome system. When the degrading capacity of this

system is exceeded, misfolded proteins accumulate in perinuclear
electron-dense bodies known as aggresomes (37). The aggresomes
identified in cardiomyocytes of a mouse expressing the CRYAB
p.Arg120Gly mutation are similarto the accumulations of primary
toxic oligomersin neurons of patients with Alzheimer disease (54)
and myocytes of patients with inclusion body myositis (55, 56).
Analysis of aggresome composition also suggeststhat they contain
an amyloid oligomer representing a primary toxic species (54).
Toxic aggregates trigger autophagy as a mechanism for clearing
the aberrant proteins from the muscle fiber (56, 57). Activation of
autophagy has been shown in both the CRYAB p.Arg120Gly mouse
model of desminopathy and muscle cell lines from patients with
inclusion body myositis (56, 57). Macroautophagy is considered
protective in late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Hun￾tington disease and other polyglutamine expansion diseases, and
it has been suggested that autophagy upregulation may be a trac￾table strategy for the treatment of a wide range of disorders(58). A
similar approach should be considered in future development of
treatments for some patients with desminopathy.
There are other cellular effects of myopathy-causing mutations
in the genes encoding various cytoskeletal and sarcomeric pro￾teins. Due to space constraints we are unable to discus these in
detail, but many are explained in a recent review (59).
Phenotypic features
Desminopathy manifests with various phenotypes. Phenotypic
variability depends on the type of inheritance and the location of
mutations within the relatively large and structurally and func￾tionally complex desmin molecule (60). The phenotype can fur￾ther be influenced by interactions between desmin and other IF
proteins and by the activity of chaperones and protein clearance
mechanisms that may be capable of compensating for the detri￾mental effects of mutant desmin.
Clinical features of almost 200 reported desminopathy patients
have been characterized as severe childhood-onset cardioskeletal
myopathy (4), adult-onsetskeletal myopathy with cardiac involve￾ment (13), pure skeletal myopathy (61, 62), cardiomyopathy with
distal weakness (15, 63, 64), pure dilated cardiomyopathy (65),
and distal myopathy with cardiac, respiratory, bulbar, facial, and
smooth muscle involvement(5, 66). Distal, limb-girdle phenotypes
and scapuloperoneal weakness with variable cardiac and respira￾tory involvement have been seen within a set of kindredssegregat￾ing with the p.Arg350Pro desmin mutation (67).
Skeletal muscle disease. Progressive skeletal myopathy is one of the
clinical variants of desminopathy (68) observed in almost a quarter
of patients (69). The illness starts at a later age than in individuals
with other disease variants, and the progression is very slow. Skeletal
muscleweaknesstypically startsin distal leg muscles and spreadsto
proximal muscles, a trend thatis about 3 times more common than
the opposite (69). In developed disease, all four limbs are affected.
Weaknessin the trunk, neck, and facial muscles can also be seen in
some patients(61). Muscle atrophy is a frequent observation. Elec￾tromyographic studies show motor unit potentials and abnormal
electric irritability characteristic of myopathy (70).
Muscle imaging studies performed in patients with desminopa￾thy have identified a recognizable pattern of muscle involvement
(71). In the lower leg, the peroneal muscles display substantially
more myopathic changes than either the tibialis anterior or the
muscles of the posterior compartment (the soleus and the medial
and lateral gastrocnemius). In the thigh, the earliest and always
most severely affected muscle is the semitendinosus (a muscle at
the back of the thigh), followed by the sartorius and gracilis. The
effects on these muscles always exceeds the involvement of the
adductor magnus, biceps femoris, and semimembranosus (71).
The anterior compartment (the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis,
intermedius, and medialis) is relatively spared. The gluteus maxi￾mus is more severely involved than gluteus medius and minimus.
Generally, the severity of degeneration in distal muscles always
exceeds that of proximal muscles (71).
Skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with desminopathy typi￾cally show irregularly shaped abnormal regions containing amor￾phous deposits that are best identified with modified trichrome
stain as dark green or bluish material localized in the subsarco￾lemma or within the cytoplasm (2, 61, 70) (Figure 4A). It requires
a high degree of awareness to recognize these deposits, as some
myopathologists consider them nonspecific. In addition, hyaline
structures, cytoplasmic bodies,rods, and spheroid-like bodies have
been reported (13, 61). Although not specific to desminopathy,
rimmed vacuoles have been observed in most cases. Other nonspe￾cific myopathic features, such as variation in fiber size, scattered
atrophic fibers, and an increased number of internal nuclei are also
frequently observed. Within the abnormal aggregates, proteins of
diverse origins, including sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and enzymatic
proteins as well as proteins not known to be normally expressed

in skeletal muscle, such as Aβ-amyloid and the amyloid precursor
protein, have been identified (72, 73). The proteins most consis￾tently present are desmin, αB-crystallin, dystrophin, myotilin, and
ubiquitin (2, 15, 61, 66, 73, 74). The amount of desmin in affected
muscle fibers of patients with desminopathy is increased, when
compared with the amount in muscle from healthy individuals, as
assessed by immunoblotting (75).
All desminopathy skeletal muscle specimens analyzed by EM have
shown accumulation of granulofilamentous material denser than
the Z disc and located beneath the sarcolemma and between the
myofibrils(76) (Figure 4B). Characteristic Z disc deformities, com￾pact bodies of spheroid or cytoplasmic type, autophagic vacuoles
containing myelin-like lamellae and debris (73), and focal group￾ings of mitochondria have also been observed (15, 26, 30). In some
cases, mitochondria are located alongside the granulofilamentous
deposits, forming characteristic sandwich-like structures (76).
In the family in which disease segregates with the CRYAB
p.Arg120Gly mutation, skeletal muscle biopsy has shown disor￾ganization of filamentous networks and regions characteristic
of desminopathy in which the intermyofibrillar network com￾pletely disappeared (77). Affected areas contain abnormal aggre￾gates immunopositive for desmin, αB-crystallin, dystrophin, and
ubiquitin. A subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulation
of dense granulofilamentous material with various degenerative
changes was also observed by EM (6, 77).
Respiratory dysfunction. Respiratory insufficiency can be a major
cause of disability and death in desminopathy patients. It causes
nocturnal hypoventilation with oxygen desaturation and, eventu￾ally, daytime respiratory failure (78). The diaphragm, unlike other
skeletal muscles, functions in an environment in which forces can
be transmitted in both longitudinal and transverse directions dur￾ing each respiratory cycle, and desmin isthe only molecule known
to have dual orientation and serve as a viscoelastic element that
dissipates mechanical energy in both planes (79). Progressive skel￾etal myopathy with early respiratory muscle involvement requir￾ing respiratory support is observed in about a third of patients
with desminopathy (69). A gradient between vital capacity in the
upright and supine position of more than 30% suggests a prefer￾ential diaphragmatic involvement (78).
Cardiomyopathy. Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities
requiring urgent implantation of a permanent pacemaker are a fre￾quent feature of desminopathy attributed to the fact that the heart
conduction system is rich in desmin (7). In a quarter of patients,
the illness presentswith cardiomyopathy (69), and cardiomyopathy
alone with no skeletal muscle involvement has also been reported
(26, 65, 80, 81). Heart disease isseen in more than 60% of patientsin
the advanced stages of illness (69). Some patients develop tachyar￾rhythmia requiring implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator(82).
The age of disease onset in cases presenting with cardiomyopathy
tendsto be earlier and the illness more severe. Desminopathy-asso￾ciated atrioventricular conduction blocks can be associated with
dilated, restrictive, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (26, 75, 80).
Variable pathogenic potentials of desmin mutations. One possible
explanation for different desmin mutations causing either skel￾etal or cardiac myopathy is the type and location of the mutation.
Mutations located in the N-terminal part of the 2B helical seg￾ment of desmin cause primarily late onset skeletal muscle disease,
with prolonged duration of illness and cardiomyopathy seen in
only 36% of patients, whereas 60%–80% of patients with mutations
in either the 1B helical segment or the tail domain develop a more
ominous disease with cardiac involvement (83). The earliest onset
and the highest frequency of cardiomyopathy are associated with
mutations located in the YRKLLEGEESRI motif in the C-termi￾nal end of the 2B helical segment (frequency of cardiomyopathy
88%). The disease is especially severe in carriers of the C-terminal
p.Asp399Tyr, p.Glu401Lys, and p.Arg406Trp desmin mutations:
age of onset is in the teens or early twenties, and life-threatening
dysphagia, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory weakness develop
within a few years (23, 24).
Inheritance
Autosomal dominant mutations. Eighty percent of desminopathy fami￾liesshowa classic autosomal dominant pattern ofinheritance, most
with full penetrance (60, 69). As some mutations are less patho￾genic than others(23), in some autosomal dominantfamilies, older
members carrying the familial pathogenic mutation were found to
be unaffected. The phenomenon of incomplete penetrance was
first demonstrated in families with the p.Ile451Met desmin muta￾tion (65, 68). In families with the p.Arg350Pro mutation, affected
men had a higher risk of sudden cardiac death, suggesting a role
for factors not immediately dependent on the location or type of
mutation (67). In several thoroughly studied families, both parents
were available for genetic testing and evidence was obtained that
one of the parents was germ-line mosaic (13, 24). False paternity in
these families was unequivocally excluded by haplotype analysis.
Fourteen percent of desmin mutations occur de novo (69),suggest￾ing that DES, in particular the part of the gene encoding the 2B
helical segment, is a hot spot for mutations.
Autosomal recessive mutations. In 6% of patients, the inheritance
pattern has been determined to be autosomal recessive. Patients
with recessive mutations develop the disease in infancy or child￾hood (at around 5 years of age) (60, 69). A homozygous deletion
of 21 nucleotides that predicts an in-frame loss of seven amino
acids from Arg173 through Glu179 (p.Arg173_Glu179del) in the
1B helical segment of desmin causes a severe clinical syndrome
and compromises the ability of desmin to assemble into IFs in
cell culture (5, 66). Even more devastating is the effect exerted by
compound heterozygosity of p.Ala360Pro and p.Asn393Ile desmin
mutations (4). A combination of p.Ala360Pro with p.Asn393Ile
resulted in childhood onset of highly aggressive cardioskeletal
myopathy, while neither of these two mutations was pathogen￾ic in several surviving family members when they occurred in a
heterozygous state (4). This observation fully correlates with the
results of functional analysis in cultured cells: when expressed
separately, p.Ala360Pro and p.Asn393Ile desmin mutantssupport
the existing IF network in C2C12 cells, but they are unable to do
so when cotransfected (23).
Modifier genes. A patient with a combination of lamin A/C
p.Arg644Cys and desmin p.Val469Met mutations developed
severe muscle weakness and complete heart block, requiring heart
transplantation (84). Immunohistochemistry of the explanted
heart and biopsied skeletal muscle showed desmin aggregates
and granulofilamentous electron dense material on EM, typical
features of desminopathy. Desmin and lamin A/C proteins are
believed to be indirectly connected via other IF proteins (84). Five
other patients under our care have shown that a combination of
mutations in DES and mutations or functional polymorphisms
in other neuromuscular genes such as α-glucosidase, ZASP,
and MYOT substantially influences the disease phenotype (our
unpublished observations).

Health care implications
Diagnosis of desminopathy. Recognition of desminopathy requires
careful correlation of clinical symptoms and findings from muscle
histology and immunopathology. The disease may be clinically het￾erogeneous and the pattern of inheritance variable. The following
criteria are important in arriving at the correct diagnosis(2, 35, 61):
history ofslowly progressive muscleweakness, dyspnea, and cardiac
arrhythmias; demonstration of proximal and distal muscle weak￾ness most often starting in the lowerlimbs and variably progressing
to the upper extremities, trunk, neck flexors, and pharyngeal and
facial muscles; restrictive ventilatory defect; EKG or cardiac moni￾toring showing conduction blocks or arrhythmias; EMG revealing
myopathic units and abnormal spontaneous activity (fibrillation
potentials, positive sharp waves, complex repetitive discharges, and
occasional myotonic discharges); moderate elevation of the serum
creatine kinase level; and characteristic alterationsin frozen sections
of muscle biopsy specimens highlighted by accumulation of amor￾phous or granular deposits that can be visualized with trichrome
and H&E stains, vacuoles, and chronic myopathic changes without
inflammation. These accumulations represent ectopic deposits of
myofibrillar proteins and should be immunopositive for desmin and
dystrophin. EM analysisshould show accumulation of granulofila￾mentous material underthe sarcolemma andwithin the myofibrils;
autophagic vacuoles are observed in some cases(61). Genetic testing
is essential for establishing an accurate diagnosis of desminopathy
and is necessary for providing appropriate genetic counseling and
timely prevention of cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure (60).
Therapeutic considerations. There is no specific treatment for des￾minopathy, but some of the complications and premature death
can be prevented (2, 61). Early detection of cardiac arrhythmias
and conduction defects is essential, since implantation of a pace￾maker can be lifesaving. Individuals with progressive orlife-threat￾ening cardiomyopathy are candidates for cardiac transplantation.
Respiratory support, consisting of continuous or bi-level positive
airway pressure, initially at night and later at daytime, are indi￾cated in patients with hypercapnea and other signs of incipient
ventilatory failure. Risk of chest infection should be considered in
these patients. Assistive devicesshould be used in individuals with
advanced skeletal muscle weakness.
Concluding remarks
Desminopathy is associated with mutations in desmin and αB￾crystallin. Most of the known disease-associated desmin muta￾tions affect amino acid residues that are crucial for filament
assembly. They also render a dominant-negative effect on desmin
function. In humans and transgenic mice, desmin mutantsinvoke
accumulation of chimeric intracellular aggregates containing des￾min and other cytoskeletal proteins. Desmin mutations show
strikingly different pathogenic effects depending on their loca￾tion, the type of amino acid change, the structural relationships
these mutations disrupt, and the type of inheritance. αB-crystal￾lin serves as a chaperone for desmin and, if mutated, can cause
desminopathy. Current knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis
of disorders resulting from desmin and αB-crystallin mutations
is sufficient for some practical recommendations. However, there
are multiple unresolved problems. We have limited understanding
of the mechanismsinvolved in muscle-specific proteolytic systems
and adaptive cellular pathways. Mechanisms leading to variable
disease expression in skeletal or cardiac muscle cells also require
additional studies. New technologies will help solve these prob￾lems and develop novel specific therapies.
