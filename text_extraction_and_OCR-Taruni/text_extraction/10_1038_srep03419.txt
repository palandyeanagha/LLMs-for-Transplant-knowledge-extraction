The International Chronic Ocular GVHD Consensus Group held 4 working meetings to define new diagnostic
metrics for chronic ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). After considering the factors currently used to
diagnose chronic ocular GVHD, the Consensus Group identified 4 subjective and objective variables to
measure in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): OSDI, Schirmer’s
score without anesthesia, corneal staining, and conjunctival injection. Each variable was scored 0–2 or 0–3, with
a maximum composite score of 11. Consideration was also given to the presence or the absence of systemic
GVHD. On the basis of their composite score and the presence or absence of systemic GVHD, patients were
assigned to one of three diagnostic categories: NO, PROBABLE, or DEFINITE ocular GVHD. New diagnostic
criteria for chronic ocular GVHD are presented by the Consensus Group. Validation studies are needed to
identify the best combination of the proposed metrics to maximize diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and has been recognized as an important complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT)1–12. Since visual function and ocular symptoms are largely related to patient’s
quality of life13, ocular complications have a great impact on morbidity after successful HSCT. More than 25000
HSCT procedures are performed annually and the number is increasing worldwide14.
Historically, cGVHD was classified as limited or extensive based on the clinical findings in a small cohort of
patients1
. Recently, diagnostic criteria for cGVHD have been proposed by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH)15. As per the NIH consensus criteria definition, ‘‘diagnosis of cGVHD requires the presence of at least 1
diagnostic clinical sign of cGVHD (e.g., polikiloderma or esophageal web) or the presence of at least 1 distinctive
manifestation (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca) confirmed by pertinent biopsy or other relevant tests (e.g., Schirmer
test) in the same or another organ.’’ The NIH Consensus therefore notes that dry eye is a distinctive sign seen in
cGVHD but insufficient in itself to establish a diagnosis of chronic GVHD. However, this precludes the early
diagnosis of systemic GVHD in the presence of new onset DED after HSCT. In this paper, we compile recently
emerging evidence that supports the classification of DED as a diagnostic clinical entity for chronic GVHD.
The purpose of international workshops on chronic ocular GVHD were:
1) To provide a consensus overview of chronic ocular GVHD.
2) To refine the definition and classification of chronic ocular GVHD.
3) To assess methods of diagnosis, evaluation, and grading of chronic ocular GVHD by reviewing previously
reported literature.
4) To generate a proposal to change dry eye syndrome as a sufficient clinical entity for the diagnosis of
cGVHD, address the diagnostic criteria, discuss the severity scores, and recommend an amendment to
the NIH Consensus diagnostic criteria for the stem cell transplantation community.

First, we would like to establish the consensus diagnostic criteria
and classification for chronic ocular GVHD. Next, after validating a
multicenter and prospective study using these criteria, we would like
to propose the new diagnostic criteria for chronic GVHD based on
ocular GVHD assessment. Our ultimate goal is to add ocular GVHD
as a diagnostic sign for chronic GVHD.
Results
DED as a diagnostic sign of chronic GVHD. DED is commonly
seen in patients with chronic GVHD6,9,16–19, and may be considered a
hallmark of chronic GVHD10,11,20–28. The proposed criteria for
diagnosis and scoring of chronic systemic as well as ocular GVHD
need to be validated in prospective studies15,29. A prospective
evaluation of patients undergoing HSCT between 1995 and 1998,
pre- and post-transplantation showed that dry eye was observed
with greater frequency in patients with systemic chronic GVHD
(70.4%), than in patients without (17.7%; P , .005)3
. Using
Schirmer score for staging of ocular GVHD as proposed by the
NIH consensus criteria, the false positive rate of diagnosis of
ocular GVHD in patients with systemic GVHD was 19.4% and
false negative rate was 22.7%. Jacobs et al. have reported similar
results10. In terms of temporal association of onset of ocular and
systemic GVHD, Balaram et al.4 have reported ocular involvement
in 62% patients with chronic GVHD. Twenty two percent of newly
onset dry eye patients after HSCT presented with severe dry eye and
conjunctival inflammation without features of systemic GVHD.
They have also reported ocular involvement as a predecessor of
systemic chronic GVHD3,4. Early diagnosis of chronic ocular
GVHD enables adequate therapeutic intervention for ocular and
systemic signs and symptoms.
There are several risk factors that predispose to the development of
chronic GVHD. These include an episode of acute GVHD, age of
donor or recipient, and donor-recipient gender disparity5
. Female
donor to male recipient transplants were shown to result in an
increased ratio of severe/total dry eye than in male donor to female
recipient30. It is well recognized that the stem cell source can impact
GVHD risk31, and Uchino, M., et al. reported increased frequency of
chronic ocular GVHD post peripheral blood stem cell transplanta￾tion (PBSCT) compared to bone marrow (BMT) or cord blood trans￾plantation (CBT)32. They demonstrated the relationship between the
development of systemic GVHD and dry eye after HSCT. Patients
with GVHD had a higher Odds Ratio for dry eye post-BMT (OR
12.28, 95% CI 2.48 to 60.5) and post-CBT (OR 13.8, 95% CI 0.4 to
448.6) compared to post-PBSCT (OR 3, 95% CI 0.4 to 22.7). These
findings suggest that dry eye in patients post-BMT/CBT was a pre￾dictor for occurrence of systemic GVHD. In PBSCT, dry eye may be
masked by intensive systemic immunosuppression. It was also noted
that late onset severe dry eye can precede non-ocular systemic
GVHD. This leads us to suggest that dry eye is an important sign
for diagnosing or treating systemic chronic GVHD.
GVHD has the potential to affect all mucosal surfaces, including
ocular, oral, vaginal, and gastrointestinal areas15. Ocular surface
mucosa is a representative target organ of chronic GVHD
(Figure 1A, B, C)2,33–37. In addition, the inner surface of ductal area
is composed of mucosal membrane which is frequently targeted T
cells or other inflammatory cells (Figure 2A), ductal area is signifi￾cantly affected in target organs such as lacrimal gland, meibomian
(Figure 2A, B) gland, nasolacrimal ducts and salivary gland, as well as
hepatic bile ducts, and lung ducts2,38–42.
Conjunctival involvement in chronic GVHD has been reported as
a sign of severe chronic GVHD2
. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival
demonstrated a decreased survival of patients with GVHD present￾ing with conjunctival involvement2
. It has been proposed by Jabs et al
that the conjunctiva may mirror systemic mucosal membrane such
as intestine, lung, and oral mucosa. They described that conjunctival
involvement by GVHD may represent ‘‘a distinct clinical finding’’2
.
The description might leads to dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca)
being recognized as a ‘‘distinct sign’’ in chronic GVHD, particularly
in reference to the NIH consensus criteria.
Conjunctivitis may present concurrently or precede the onset of
dry eye in chronic GVHD. Conjunctival inflammation may be a
primary manifestation of chronic GVHD or secondary to severe
dry eye. The role of conjunctival biopsy for ocular GVHD remains
unclear. A recent report studied conjunctival biopsy specimen in
symptomatic patients suspected of ocular GVHD34. Using a modified
Lerner classification designed for skin GVHD histopathology, Auw￾Haedrich and colleagues found that the modified grade III–IV bulbar
conjunctival inflammation cohort compared to modified grade I–II
showed shorter survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis. This study sup￾ports the earlier observation made by Jabs et al that conjunctival
involvement may confer a prognostic value.
We can detect the ocular surface change of chronic GVHD directly
by using a biomicroscope and comprehensive variables for diagnos￾ing dry eye disease after HSCT. Therefore, early detection, precise
diagnosis, and treatment of dry eye in ocular GVHD as well as
systemic GVHD are necessary to prevent the blindness for long term
survivors.
Based on these reports, dry eye post-HSCT has been established as
a significant finding in the spectrum of systemic involvement in
chronic GVHD. Since dry eye can precede clinical signs in other
organs, we propose the inclusion of dry eye as a concrete diagnostic

sign of chronic GVHD without being substantiated by involvement
in other organ systems as originally recommended by the NIH
working committee.
Proposed diagnostic criteria and severity of grading system. A
collaborative, prospective-multicenter study from the USA, the
Netherlands, and Japan on ocular GVHD has been proposed.
Based on discussion and consensus at the 1st Chronic Ocular
GVHD meeting, the parameters for diagnosis include 1) Ocular
Surface Disease Index (OSDI)43,44, 2) Schirmer’s test score without
anesthesia45, 3) Corneal fluorescein staining (Figure 3)45,46, and 4)
conjunctival injection (Figure 4)47. Ocular GVHD classification
will be based on the baseline examination as threshold scores for
grading. The proposed grading system is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Severity scores 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be assigned to OSDI, corneal
fluoresecein staining, and Schirmer’s score44–46. Conjunctival injec￾tion will be scored 0, 1, and 2 (Table 1)47. The corneal fluorescein
staining score ranged from 0 to 3 points (Grade 0 5 no staining,
Grade 1 5 minimal staining, Grade 2 5 mild/moderate staining,
Grade 3 5 severe staining) (Figure 3)46. The conjunctival
hyperemia score of the conjunctiva ranged from 0 to 2 points
(Grade 0 5 none, Grade 1 5 mild/moderate, Grade 2 5 severe)
(Figure 4)47. Any score above 1 points is regarded as abnormal.
Disease severity will be graded as none, mild/moderate and severe
based on an aggregate of scores for each parameter (Table 1). Based
on the presence or absence of systemic GVHD and the aggregate
scores assessed, a diagnosis of ocular GVHD will be made (Table 2).
In the presence of systemic GVHD, score 0–3 indicates absence of

ocular GVHD; score 4–5 indicates ‘‘probable’’ ocular GVHD and
score $6 indicates ‘‘definite’’ ocular GVHD. In the absence of sys￾temic GVHD, score 0–5 indicates absence of ocular GVHD, score 6–
7 indicates ‘‘probable’’ ocular GVHD and score $8 indicates ‘‘def￾inite’’ ocular GVHD (Table 2). Based on the above criteria, data
collected at each center will be analyzed and validated at a central
location and a proposal to amend the NIH consensus criteria will be
presented.
Discussion
DED is responsible for a significant decrease in the quality of life in
allogeneic transplant recipients. DED is currently listed as a distinct￾ive sign, and not a diagnostic criteria sufficient alone for establishing
a diagnosis of chronic GVHD by the NIH consensus criteria15.
The NIH consensus criteria diagnosis and staging working group
report defined ocular criteria for diagnosis as ‘‘new ocular sicca
documented by low Schirmer test values with a mean value of both
eyes #5 mm at 5 minutes or a new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca
by slit-lamp examination with mean values of 6 to 10 mm on the
Schirmer test accompanied by distinctive manifestations in at
least 1 other organ’’15. While recognizing that the NIH criteria were
developed for the use of transplant physicians in prospective clinical
trials for chronic GVHD, the ocular criteria need to be evaluated by
ophthalmologists. Decreased Schirmer’s score, signs, and symptoms
of DED must be assessed simultaneously in correlation with the
clinical findings, since infection, trauma, and side effects from pro￾longed use of topical medications may also present with ocular sur￾face disease. Using the Schirmer’s score as a sole defining criterion for
the diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD would be inadequate. The
high false positive and negative rates of diagnosis of ocular GVHD if
based solely on the Schirmer score have been reported by various
groups10. In addition, the importance of a comprehensive ocular
evaluation has been stressed. It is commonly accepted that 5 mm
of wetting denotes tear deficiency when the test is performed without
anesthesia. However, a comparable diagnostic cut-off value for
Schirmer’s test with anesthesia is not as clear. Other limitations
include the errors in measurement induced by reflex tearing and
the influence of external environmental factors brings its infallibility
into question48. Patient symptom scores, ocular surface staining, tear
film dynamics, are all important in assessing a patient with dry eye in
ocular GVHD, especially in assessing systemic chronic GVHD.
Diagnostic procedures for dry eye have been reported by the
International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) report13. Modification
of the proposed criteria may allow for standardization of dry eye
assessment in chronic GVHD because patient evaluation, follow￾up and treatment regimens differ at various centers. Irrespective, a
careful examination by an ophthalmologist perceptive to the dia￾gnosis of ocular GVHD serves a crucial role. A collaborative dialogue
between the ophthalmologists and BMT specialists can lead to
improved management of chronic GVHD in general3,6.
Considering conjunctival staining as parameter to assess ocular
GVHD, there is no reliable, standardized, and readily adopted way to
assess the conjunctival staining element of ocular GVHD at present
time. Conjunctival staining is more variable even than corneal stain￾ing. In addition, while there are patients with conjunctival staining
that don’t stain corneas, the diagnostic criteria are ill-defined.
Therefore, we exclude the conjunctival staining as the consensus
parameter for the diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD at present time.
The NIH proposed scoring system for ocular GVHD (Table 3)15 is
easy to understand and can be performed without a clinical exam￾ination even by a non-ophthalmologist. However, it may not be able
to accurately assess the severity of the disease. There is an inherent
limitation in a scale that relies on behavior rather than objective
findings.
The current grading systems available for ocular GVHD rely on
clinical findings only. Jabs’ proposed stages of conjunctival ocular
GVHD are applicable to acute GVHD2
; Robinson et al proposed a
grading system for chronic ocular GVHD. Both are based on clinical
findings36. Baseline profiles of ocular surface and tear film dynamics,
in patients post-HSCT with or without chronic GVHD related dry
eye have been reported. In this report, baseline values indicative of
dry eye, using modern diagnostic techniques were demonstrated49.
These data may be useful for an additional detailed evaluation of
chronic ocular GVHD. Analysis of the efficacy of topical and sys￾temic treatment for chronic ocular GVHD must take into account
the baseline clinical findings and their severity49. It is our opinion,
that a metric inclusive of patient symptom evaluation by the ocular
surface disease index (OSDI) could be used to evaluate the effect on
activities of daily living rather than the frequency of instillation of eye
drops.
The recommendation of the current Chronic Ocular GVHD
Workshop is to propose changes in the NIH Consensus Diagnostic
Criteria to include chronic ocular GVHD, as a diagnostic criteria
sufficient alone to establish a diagnosis of chronic GVHD. We also
propose and amendment of the severity scoring criteria for chronic
ocular GVHD by validating the metric proposed by our group. This
will be done using the data generated at the centers enrolled in this
study. Once validated, chronic ocular GVHD-specific metric, may be
a valuable tool for future clinical trials and may help patients with
ocular and systemic chronic GVHD. Early prophylaxis, diagnosis
and treatment can be accomplished by examining the eye in detail.

In this regard, a prospective study evaluating a comprehensive oph￾thalmic evaluation pre- and post-transplantation to diagnose new
onset dry eye or other chronic ocular GVHD-related and non￾GVHD complications is needed. It is necessary to communicate in
detail concerning the dose of systemic and local immunosuppressant
and the time of commencement and cessation for treatment between
transplant internists and ophthalmologists.
Methods
The International Ophthalmology Consensus Conference on Chronic Ocular GVHD
was held comprising nine ophthalmologists from the USA, the Netherlands and
Japan. The workshop occurred with the purpose of reviewing the published data,
gathering a consensus from those in the field, with clinical practice and research
interests in chronic ocular GVHD, and providing guidelines for diagnostic criteria.
Four working meetings by the International Chronic Ocular GVHD Consensus
Group were held. Each investigator participated in reviewing the data and the col￾lective suggestions for the significance of DED in the diagnosis for systemic GVHD.
The metric for diagnostic criteria, the severity of DED and relevance to systemic
GVHD were discussed to identify currently used diagnostic variables in patients’
history and examination. Subjective and objective factors were considered and scores
were assigned to each variable to reflect severity of the disease. Consideration was
given to the presence or absence of systemic GVHD.
Lacrimal gland histology. Lacrimal gland biopsy specimens that had been obtained
for diagnostic purposes were used for histological analysis.
This study was approved by the Keio University Institutional Review Boards
(#2009-0277). Written informed consent was obtained in advance from the patient in
accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki for human
subjects.
