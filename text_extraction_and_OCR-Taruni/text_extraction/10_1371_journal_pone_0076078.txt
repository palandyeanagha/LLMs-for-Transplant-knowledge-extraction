Abstract
During acute inflammation, functioning lymphatics are believed to reduce edema and to provide a transiting route for
immune cells, but the extent at which the dermal lymphatic remodeling impacts lymphatic transport or the factors
regulating these changes remains unclear. Herein we quantify the increase in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and
examine the expression of pro-angiogenenic and lymphangiogenic factors during acute cutaneous hypersensitivity
(CHS). We found that LECs actively proliferate during CHS but that this proliferation does not affect the lymphatic
vessel density. Instead, lymphatic remodeling is accompanied by lymphatic vessel leakiness and lower ejection of
lymph fluid, which is observed only in the proximal lymphatic vessel draining the inflamed area. LECs and the
immune cells release growth factors and cytokines during inflammation, which impact the lymphatic
microenvironment and function. We identified that FGF-2, PLGF-2, HGF, EGF, and KC/CXCL17 are differentially
expressed within tissues during acute CHS, but both VEGF-C and VEGF-D levels do not significantly change. Our
results indicate that VEGF-C and VEGF-D are not the only players and other factors may be responsible for the
LECs proliferation and altered lymphatic function in acute CHS.

Introduction
The processes of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are
recognized to play critical roles in cancer progression,
metastasis, and many chronic diseases, but also serve non￾pathological roles in the normal progression and resolution of
inflammation [1]. During inflammation, functioning lymphatics
are believed to reduce edema and to provide a transiting route
for immune cells; but whether extensive dermal lymphatic
remodeling that presumably takes place in inflamed tissue
directly impacts transport remains unclear. Indeed, using near￾infrared fluorescence (NIRF) lymphatic imaging, we and others
have noted both dense hyperplasia and hypoplasia of dermal
lymphatics in the arms and legs of lymphedema subjects with
profound edema, suggesting a more complex relationship
between dermal lymphatic remodeling and effective lymphatic
transport [2,3]. Whether the dermal lymphatic remodeling
directly benefits regional lymphatic transport and edema
reduction, or whether other factors are responsible, remains to
be investigated.
Because the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
family of ligands and receptors are known to promote both
hemovascular and lymphatic proliferation, several
investigations have focused on their role in vascular
remodeling during acute and chronic skin inflammation [4–7].
VEGF-C signaling through VEGFR3 is required for embryonic
lymphangiogenesis and therefore believed to be a major player
in adult lymphatic remodeling [1]. VEGF-C expression in the
skin reduces inflammatory symptoms of cutaneous
hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice and has been postulated to
decrease edema and the inflammatory response to CHS by
specifically enhancing the lymphatic proliferation [4]. Other
members of the VEGF family (such as VEGF-A and VEGF-D)
induce lymphangiogenesis in vivo through their interaction with
VEGFR3, but each has different effects on CHS [8,9]. In
contrast to evidence that lymphangiogenesis mediates edema,
Huggenberger et al. used Evans blue dye to show that no
changes in ear lymphatic drainage patterns occur in acute CHS
reactions despite the observation that edema accompanying
CHS is reduced in K14-VEGF-C and K14-VEGF-D
overexpressing mice compared to control mice [5]. Thus, while
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e76078

VEGFR-3 mediated lymphangiogenesis has been studied as
part of the initiation and resolution of inflammation, the role of
effectors of lymphatic function has yet to be investigated with
non-invasive techniques that (i) directly and longitudinally
assess changes in lymphatic function and (ii) enable correlation
to the expression of immune and other stimulatory factors that
impact the contraction and ejection fraction of the “pumping”
lymphatic system.
To investigate the role of lymphatic function in acute
inflammation, we induced acute CHS reactions in normal mice
and longitudinally imaged the dermal lymphatics afferent, and
the contractile, conducting lymphatics efferent to the regional
draining lymph node using NIRF lymphatic imaging. We
evaluated the population of cells in inflamed skin, using flow
cytometry and histology, as a function of time after induction of
acute CHS reaction and assessed lymphatic endothelial cell
(LEC) proliferation using a method of incorporation to directly
assess proliferation quantitatively. We also assessed the tissue
protein expression of growth factors associated to
angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and inflammation.
Our results show that the LECs proliferate in early onset of
CHS, but that this proliferation is not sustained from day 4 to 7
post-CHS. We also determined that the efferent lymph
transport is impaired in early CHS as shown by a reduction in
lymph ejection, but not by a reduction in lymphatic vessel
contractility in both the inflamed and contralateral untreated
sides of animals. We then identified several growth factors and
inflammatory molecules to be differentially expressed in early
inflammation as compared to non-treated animals and animals
at later stages of the CHS reaction. VEGF-C and VEGF-D
expression were not significantly changed during the course of
the CHS reaction. These data may indicate that multiple growth
factors other than VEGF-C and VEGF-D work in concordance
with VEGF family to promote LECs proliferation, regression,
and mediate lymph flow for resolution of CHS inflammation.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was performed in strict accordance with animal
use protocols approved by The Animal Welfare Committee at
the University of Texas Health Science Center (IACUC,
protocol number AWC 12-015). Mice were euthanized if they
met any early removal criteria (lethargy, hunched posture, or
ruffled coat) to limit suffering.
Induction of cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity
(CHS) reaction and EdU injections
CHS reactions were induced in wild type C57B/6 mice. For
all studies, mice were sensitized by topical application on the
shaved upper back of 50µl 2% oxazolone (4-
Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one) (Sigma, St Louis,
MO) in acetone: olive oil (4:1 vol/vol). Five days after
sensitization (day 0), mice were challenged with 100µl 1%
oxazolone in solution on the shaved lower back. To assess cell
proliferation, 200µg of EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine)
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsband, CA) in 200µl PBS was
injected IP in challenged mice and in unchallenged mice every
24 hour for 3 days from day 0. All animal studies were
approved by the Animal Welfare Committee at the University of
Texas Health Science Center.
Isolation of cells from mouse tissue, fluorescence￾activated cell sorting, and flow cytometry analysis
Mice were humanly euthanized at day 0, 3, or 7 days post￾CHS challenge. Skin tissue was removed and placed in 0.1%
trypsin in HSBS with 1% FBS for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The dermis was then separated from the
epidermis using forceps and scissors and minced in 1mm
sections before being incubated in 1mg/ml collagenase/dispase
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in HSBS with 5% FBS at 37°C for 45
minutes on a shaking platform. After incubation, the dermis
samples were placed on ice. The dermis was passed through a
70µm tissue sieve using a rubber plunger. The sieve was
rinsed multiple times with PBS. The collected cell mixture was
then centrifuged to form a cell pellet. Cells were washed once
with staining buffer (5% FBS in HSBS with 5mM EDTA) and
then resuspended in staining buffer with of FC block (BD
Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) before incubated with
fluorescence conjugated primary antibodies against CD45
(clone 30-F11) (Ebioscience, San Diego, CA), CD31 (clone
390) (Ebioscience), podoplanin (clone eBio8.1.1)
(Ebioscience), and Calcein AM 10µM (BD Bioscience) for 30
minutes on ice. We selected the markers CD31 and podoplanin
to identify LECs [10]. Adequate sampling of LECs was
indicated with LEC counts >300.
For cell proliferation analysis, cell isolation was performed as
described above, but samples were enriched for CD31 positive
cells before staining. The sample was incubated for 30 minutes
on ice with biotin conjugated CD31 clone 390 (Ebioscience).
Streptavidin magnetic beads, MagCellect Streptavidin
Ferrofluid (R&D Systems, Mineapolis, MN), were added to the
cell mixture and incubated for 10 minutes on ice. The sample
tube was placed in a magnet holder to allow separation. The
supernatant was removed. CD31+ cells were washed and
stained for CD45, podoplanin, and Calcein AM, and
Streptavidin PE-CY7 (Ebioscience). Cells were sorted and
collected in media with 20% FBS. After sorting, cells were fixed
with PFA 2% for 5 minutes, permeabilized with saponin for
1minute, and stained for EdU intercalation using the Click-iT
EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay kit (Invitrogen
Corporation). Cells were resuspended in staining buffer with
DAPI at 5µg/ml. In this case, DAPI was use to differential cells
from debris that was accumulated during cell sorting. During
the analysis, we used the total population of CD31+ cells as a
control to set the positive gate for EdU, since we could obtain a
larger sample size using this population. We slightly adjusted
the gates in each individual experiment to allow for changes in
staining efficiencies and digestions, but the gates within each
experiments remained the same. All flow cytometry and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed
using the BD FACSAria™ II (BD Bioscience) and the BD
FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience) and data analysis was
performed using FlowJo version 7.5.6 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR)
(see Figure S1).

Immunoblot
Cells isolated by FACS were plated on a 24 well tissue
culture plates coated with fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich) (5µg/ml)
in ECM media (Sciencell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad,
CA) enriched with 5% FBS, antibiotic, 100 units/mL of
Penicillin, 100 µg/mL of Streptomycin, and Endothelial Cell
Growth Supplement (Sciencell Research Laboratories) in a
humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2
. The media was
changed after the cells adhered to the plate (5 hours). Cells
were cultured for 2 days before being lysed using RIPPA buffer
(1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,0.15M
NaCl, 2mM EDTA in Tris base). Protein lysates were quantified
using BCA assay (Thermo, Fisher Science, Rockford, IL).
Membrane was blotted with antibodies against PROX-1 (Relia
Tech, Germany), LYVE-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and
GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Secondary detection
was performed using antibodies conjugated with IRDye800 (Li￾Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NB) and detected by the Odyssey
system (Li-Cor Biosciences) imager for near-infrared
fluorescence.
Immunohistochemistry
Cells isolated by FACS were placed on tissue culture plates
coated with fibronectin (5µg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were
grown in ECM media for 2 days before being trypsinized and
plated on culture slides (BD Bioscience). Cells were fixed with
4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.1% tritonX. After PBS
washes, blocking buffer (5% donkey serum in PBS with 1%
BSA) was added to the well and incubated for 1 hour at RT.
Primary antibodies to PROX-1(Relia Tech) and Podoplanin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) were
diluted in blocking buffer and incubated in the wells overnight at
4°C. Cells were then stained with secondary antibody
conjugated to fluorescent dye for detection. Microscopy was
then performed using Leica DM6000B/TCS SP5.
Paraffin-embedded sections from mouse whole skin were
sectioned at 7µM and de-paraffinized using Xylene 100% for 3
minutes twice and then rehydrated using a gradient of ethanol.
Heat antigen retrival was performed at 100°C for 30 minutes in
calcium citrate buffer 10mM at pH 6. Sections were first
incubated in blocking buffer for 1hour and then stained
overnight at 4°C with podoplanin primary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). After washing, sections were incubated with
secondary anti-hamster alexa-546 (Invitrogen) for 2 hours at
room temperature. Stained sections were imaged (Leica
DM600B) and analyzed using the Surveyor Software (Objective
Imaging Ltd, Cambridge, UK). To measure lymphatic density, 5
random regions of interest of 100µm x 100µm were selected.
Each region encompassed the epidermis. We counted the
number of vessels positive for Podoplanin staining counted. A
vessel was defined as a structure with a lumen and at least one
DAPI positive nucleus within the structure. We also used
ImageJ to determine the cross sectional area of the each
vessel.
Tube formation Assay
Wells of a 96-well tissue coated plate were coated with 20µl
of Matrigel (BD Bioscience). Matrigel was allowed to become
solid at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cells isolated by FACS were
diluted in ECM media and 5 x 104
 cells were plated in each
well. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator
for 24 hours. Bright field microscopy was performed at that time
to assess structures using a Leica DM IL microscope.
Lymphatic imaging
NIRF lymphatic imaging was conducted to determine
whether there was a change in architecture of the lymphatic
vessels and to assess changes in efferent lymphatic function
from the draining lymph nodes on the side of inflammation and
on the untreated, contralateral side of the same mouse, in
order to determine whether the effects were systemic. Wild
type C57B/6 mice were imaged before the sensitization, at
day3 and day 7 post topical application on the right thigh of the
mouse. This area was selected because it drains its lymph into
the inguinal lymph node, as does the lymph from the tail, and
therefore allowed us to examine the effect of inflammation on
the lymphatic vasculature afferent to the draining lymph nodes
without having to inject dye directly into the inflamed skin. For a
detailed protocol of mouse lymphatic imaging see Robinson et
al [11]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and
with a 31-gauge needle, 5 µL to 10 µL of ICGreen (Akorn Inc.,
Lake Forest, IL) were injected ID at 5mg/ml in the left and right
side of the base of the tail. The animals were then imaged
using a custom NIRF imaging system. Image integration times
of 200ms were used and 1000 image frames were analyzed to
quantify propulsive lymphatic flow function on each lateral side
of the mice. ImageJ and Matlab were used to analyze the
images. To determine the effect of CHS on the lymphatic flow
of the conducting vessel connecting the inguinal and the
axillary lymph node (LN)s was measured through counting the
number of dye “packets” transiting collecting vessels for the
duration of imaging [12]. The plot of fluorescence intensity
versus time and length along the lymphatic vessel enabled
spatio-temporal assessment of distal and proximal lymphatic
propulsive flow. We used these plots to determine the
lymphatic velocity, the time a packet moved from the inguinal
lymph node to the axillary LN after a contraction, and the time
in which the vessels are saturated with dye. These
measurements were taken for a series of N>10 pulses per
animal per group.
Measurement of angiogenic and lymphangiogenenic
factor
Inflamed skin was harvested from untreated mice as well as
mice 3 and 7 days post-CHS. The dermis was separated from
the epidermis and the dermis was homogenized in RIPA buffer
with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein
levels were quantified using the MILLIPLEX Mouse
Angiogenesis/Growth Factor Panel (MAGPMAG-24K) (EMD
Millipore) and protocol provided by the manufacturer. Analysis
was performed on a Luminex 200 (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX)
and used the Xpotent 3.1.871.0 Software (Luminex Corp.,
Austin, TX) and the concentration of each analyte was
determined using a log regression curve and a standard curve.
The assay was performed in quadruplicate on each sample

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e76078

and the concentration of analytes and p values of one
representative replicate were reported.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using R and excel
statistical functions (Microsoft) [13]. Groups were compared
using the non-parametric Kruskall Wallis test or student T test
or ANOVA where appropriate. Experiments involving multiple
groups were first compared using ANOVA followed by T test for
comparing differences between specific relevant groups. P￾values were corrected within each experiment using false
discovery rate (FDR) correction. Comparisons were considered
significant if p-value < 0.05 and FDR < 0.1.
Results
Identification of lymphatic endothelial cell in normal
mouse
LECs markers have been identified in the last 15 years.
These markers have been used to isolate LECs from human
and murine dermal tissue in the past [5,14,15]. We aimed to
identify the relative changes in cell populations within mouse
skin. CD45 was used as a marker for the identification of
leukocytes and CD31+/podplanin+ were used as markers for
the LEC population. Unlike the work of others, we employed
the viability dye Calcein AM to differentiate the non-cellular
events expected from collagenous tissues from the events that
arose from viable cells before gating on FCS-A/SSC-A dot plot.
It is noteworthy that, more than 50% of the events in the
CD45-/CD31+/podoplanin+ gate were found to be non-viable
events (Figure S1), indicating the need to use viability dyes to
obtain accurate LEC percentages from skin samples. After
selecting for live cells, we isolated by FACS the events that
were negative for CD45 and positive for both CD31 and
podoplanin (Figure 1A). These FACS isolated cells accounted
for 1.16% of the CD45- cells in untreated, wild type C57BL\6
mice skin.
Immunoblot for PROX-1 and LYVE-1 showed comparable
expression levels in the FACS isolated cells and cultured
human dermal microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells
(Figure 1B). Immunostaining of the FACS isolated cells also

shown by the multiple populations observed. We then gated the positive events for caicein Am as shown in the left plot. The right
plot shows the viable cells plotted for expression of CD31 and podoplanin, which we identified to be LEC population. (B) Western

showed nuclear expression of PROX-1 and membrane staining
for podoplanin consistent with LEC identity (Figure 1C). Finally,
the FACS isolated cells formed tube structures on matrigel
within 24 hours while the control cells which were CD45-/
CD31-/Podoplanin- did not (Figure 1D). Together, this data
indicated that the isolated cell population was of LECs origin.
Identification of changes in cell populations of the skin
in CHS reactions
One of the hallmarks of CHS is the infiltration of leukocytes
in the inflamed area at day 3 post-treatment. We observed a
significant increase in leukocyte (CD45+) cells from 42% to
75% of the total viable cell population indicating that leukocytes
infiltrated the inflamed skin (Figure 2A). Because of this large
infiltration, there is a corresponding change in the proportion of
non-leukocyte (CD45-) cell from 47% in non-treated skin to
12% of the total viable cell population at day 3 post CHS
(Figure 2B). There were no significant changes in the
percentage of both CD45+ and CD45- cells between day 3
post-CHS and day 7 post-CHS, indicating a limited change in
the cellular composition of the skin between those time points.
We compared the relative changes in LECs percentage
within the non-leukocyte cell population during CHS to
determine if changes in LEC numbers could be observed using
this method. The relative percentage of the non-leukocyte cell
population provided a comparison to determine the relative
abundance of LECs during treatment. Flow cytometry analysis
of inflamed skin samples showed that the relative percentage
of LECs (Calcein Am+/CD45-/CD31+/podoplanin+) within the
non-leukocyte cells population increased from 1.16% to 1.69%
at day 3 post-CHS as compared to non-treated mice, and
reduced in percentages at day 7 post-CHS (1.3%), p<0.05
(Figure 2C). These results indicate that LEC population
increases in relative abundance, within the non-leukocyte
population, following the onset of acute inflammation. In
contrast, we found that the relative percentage of non￾Figure 2. Quantification of LECs in vivo. (A-C) Single cell suspension was isolated from non-treated wild type mice, 3, or 7 days

using flow cytometry analysis and the FLOWJo software. We observed that the percentage of viable CD45+ cells within the viable
cell population in the skin of mice was elevated at days 3, and 7 post-CHS compared to non-treated animals (p<0.05). The
percentage of the CD45- cell population within the viable population decreased at days 3 and day7 post-CHS compared to non￾treated. Animals (p<0.05) We observed that the percentage of viable CD45-

increased significantly (p<0.05) at day 3 post CHS as compared to non-treated, and 7 days post CHS. (E) Immunofluorescence

leukocyte cells that were CD45-/CD31+/podoplanin- cells (or
blood endothelial cells (BECs)) decreased significantly from
non-treated skin (4.8%) to day3 (2.7%) and day 7 post-CHS
(1.9%) without being significantly different between these latter
two time points (Figure 2 D). It was previously observed by
others that the blood vessel density is unchanged at day 2 of
CHS, but that the blood vessels are dilated and leaky during
CHS [16–19]. We therefore hypothesized that since the relative
percentages of LECs increased, that the LEC population might
be proliferating.
We found that the fluorescence intensity from CD31 and
podoplanin antibodies that defined the LEC population
remained constant with and without CHS treatment indicating
that CD31 expression does not change on LECs with
inflammation, in agreement with conclusions reached using
other methods [20].
We measured the lymphatic density in the dermis by
histology in non-treated animals, and at day 3, 5, and 7 post￾CHS (Figure 2E). There was no significant difference in the
lymphatic density between the time points (Figure 2E-F),
consistent with the findings of others [4,6]. While many cells
were stained for podoplanin at day 3 post-CHS, they were not
within structures with a defined lumen. These cells might
originate not only from LECs since we also observed by flow
cytometry that populations of leukocyte cells also express
podoplanin. We found that the cross sectional area of the
vessels is significantly larger at day 3 post-CHS compared to
the other days (Figure 2F).
Measuring lymphatic endothelial cells proliferation in
CHS reactions
To determine whether the LECs undergo proliferation in the
skin at day 3 of CHS as indicated by the histological
observation and the relative abundance of LECs, we used EdU
intercalation as a marker of cell proliferation [21,22]. We found
that more than 20.45% of the LECs had incorporated EdU
between onset of CHS and day 3 as compared to 4.25% in
untreated mice (p<0.001) (Figure 3A-B). We also wanted to
determine if LEC proliferation was restricted to the initial onset
days of CHS and found that only 6.75% of the LEC were EdU
positive if mice were injected with EdU from day 4 to day 7
post-CHS. We also measured the percentage of the total
CD31+ cells (leukocyte and non-leukocytes) that intercalated
EdU in the skin in order to determine the level of EdU
fluorescence within proliferating cells. We observed a similar
induction of cell proliferation in the total CD31+ population
(Figure 3A,C). These data indicate that the observed increase
in the relative percentage of LECs population may be
responsible for changes in histological observation, and that
vessel integrity might be due in part by a transient induction in
LECs proliferation.
Lymphatic flow measurement using near infrared dye
ICG
Lymphatic vessels are used for the infiltration of immune
cells to the site of inflammation and enable their transport to
regional LNs where the immune response occurs. We show in
this study, as others have also shown, that lymphatic flow is
perturbed during inflammation [4,23,24]. NIRF imaging results
did not show changes in lymphatic architecture throughout
CHS reaction. In the images taken pre-CHS, dye was well
circumscribed within the vessels, but not at day 3, 5 and 7
post-CHS where imaging indicated dye extravasation (Figure 4
A-D). As prominently shown in the dorsal and lateral views of
CHS treated and the non-treated sides of a mouse 3 days post￾CHS, the lymphatic vessels “leaked” dye extravascularly, but
still conducted lymph as shown by the ability of the dye to
reach the axillary lymph node (Figure 4 E-I).
Pre-treatment, lymph propulsion occurred in the conducting
vessels between the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes at a
frequency of 5.3 ± 2.7 pulses/minutes, consistent with
previously reported values (See Video S1 and Figure 5A) [12].
The temporal motion can also be visualized using the spatio￾temporal fluorescence intensity maps that delineate
propagating ICG-laden lymph. In Figure 5A, the region of
higher intensity from ICG-laden lymph moves proximally from
ROI-1 to ROI-25 in 1.5 sec (arrows on the spatio-temporal
plot). At a fixed ROI along the conducting lymphatic vessel
(dotted arrow, Figure 5A-D), the fluorescence intensity first
increases with the filling of the lymphangion and then
decreases, indicating lymphangion contraction and emptying of
ICG-laden lymph that is repeated in a peristaltic manner.
At day 3 after onset of CHS, we observed similar rates of
contractile lymphatic propulsion of 5.6 ± 2.1 pulse/minutes, but
with a consistent “reflux” of ICG-laden lymph (Figure 5B and
see Video S2). A typical spatio-temporal fluorescence intensity
map at day 3 demonstrates a “reflux” phenomenon with both
proximal and distal ICG-laden lymph flow (black arrows, Figure
5B, Figure S2) as well as a broadening of the intensity crest
that may indicate incomplete emptying and filling of lymphatic
segment. We measured that there was a significant, 2-fold
increase in the time it took for the vessel to be filled with dye
(the intensity crest) as compared to that in the non-treated
animals to the animals at day 3 post-CHS. We also observed
that even if the velocity of the lymph (i.e., the time the ICG￾laden lymph packet took to move the distance from the inguinal
lymph node to the axially LN) was the same. This observation
was made in every animal we imaged. These data indicate that
the effectiveness of the flow is affected by CHS. At day 7 post￾CHS treatment, the lymphatic insufficiency was resolved but
still exhibited “reflux” (Video S3 and Figure 5C). The reflux
phenomenon was not observed in the contra-lateral, untreated
sides of the animals (Video S4 and Figure 5D).
Thus, while the rates of lymphatic contractility were not
affected during CHS treatment, lymphatic “reflux” results in less
efficient transport of lymph in the inflamed skin lymphatic
vessels, resulting in lymphatic insufficiency, with subsequent
recovery.
Identification of pro-angiogenic.- lymphangiogenic
factors in CHS
We sought to identify which pro-angiogenic and pro￾lymphangiogenic factors were present in mice dermal tissues
undergoing active LEC proliferation and in which lymphatic
function was disrupted. To address the local environment of the
lymphatic vasculature, we interrogated the concentration of

protein in the dermis and excluded the epidermis which lacks
lymphatic vessels. Many growth factors and cytokines are
produced by cells in the epidermis (such as keratinocytes), but
these factors need to infiltrate the dermis to act directly on
LECs. Thus, by assessing the dermis, we measured the growth
factors within the local environment of the lymphatic vessels.
We performed a milliplex assay for 27 analytes on total protein
isolated from mice dermis in non-treated animals, animals at
day 3 post-CHS, and day 7 post CHS treatment. We compared
the ratios to normal levels between the groups and found 11
factors out of 27 were significantly increased at day 3
compared to both non-treated and day 7 animals (Table S1).
The factors, Angiopoietin-2, Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF), sALK-1, Amphiregulin, endothelin, -1,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Placenta growth factor- 2
(PLGF-2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α (MIP-1α),
VEGF-A, TNF-α and KC/CXCL17 were significantly increased
(p<0.05 and FDR<0.1) compared to both levels pre-treatment
and at day 7 post-CHS (Figure 6). With a sample size powered
for 80% and change in ratio of 0.6, it is interesting to note that
the concentration of VEGF-C and VEGF-D did not significantly
change during the course of CHS reaction with increase/
decrease of LEC population and decrease/increase of
lymphatic function. This data indicates that other growth
factors, which are either increase or decrease in expression in
tissues, may work in concert with VEGFC and VEGFD to
induce LECs proliferation and changes in lymphatic function in
acute CHS.
Discussion
The phenomenon of lymphatic remodeling or change in
lymphatic function caused by acute inflammation is not well
understood. In this study, we determined that LECs
proliferation occurs in early stages of inflammation and is
accompanied by infiltration of CD45+ cells and the loss of
lymphatic function.
We developed a method to identify proliferative LECs in vivo
to allow us to determine that the LECs proliferate starting at the
onset of the CHS, but do not proliferate after the peak of CHS
at day 3. The percentage of non-leukocyte cells decreased
significantly at day 3 and 7 post-CHS compared to non-treated
animals. This decrease in the relative percentage of non￾leukocyte cell population is most probably due to the infiltration
of CD45+ leukocytes, which is a hallmark of CHS. The relative
percentage of BECs within the leukocyte population decreased

We observed a significant increase in the number of LECs and total CD31+ cells that intercalated EdU from day 0 to 3, the treated
anmials with injection from day 4 to 7, and the non-treated groups (N=3) (p<0.001).

from non-treated skin to day 3 post-CHS, but may be an artifact
in relative numbers due to the increase in infiltrating
leukocytes. Others have shown that angiogenesis does not
occurs in the ear during CHS since no changes in vessel
density were observed, but that the vessels increase in size
and become leaky in response to CHS [16]. Here we identified
that the BECs population decreases relative to the non￾leukocyte population. We hypothesize that this relative
decrease in BECs percentage is not due to a decrease in the
actual number of cells, but rather due to a reduction of the
overall contribution of BECs within the non-leukocyte
population that arises because of the proliferation of other non￾leukocytes. Using a similar logic, an increase in the relative
percentage of LECs within in the non-leukocyte population
indicates that the LECs population must change at a higher
rate than the average non-leukocyte population and therefore,
may be proliferating. Consistent with other reports, our
histological results show that the lymphatic density does not
increase during CHS [6]. We observed an increase in the area
of the lymphatic vessels at day 3 of CHS, which corresponded
with the time at which we found that lymphatic vessels become
leaky using NIRF imaging. These data are indicative of vessel
modification. We also found an increased number of
podoplanin+ cells by histology at day 3 post-CHS. The
combination of the increase in relative percentage of LECs, the
histological observation of the increase number of single
podoplanin cells, and the leakiness of the lymphatic
vasculature led us to hypothesize that the lymphatic vascular
modification includes LEC proliferation. To confirm this
hypothesis, we used EdU intercalation as an indication of the
level of LEC proliferation. We found that the rate of EdU
intercalation increased to 20.45% from 4.25% in non-treated
skin, which is indicative of LECs proliferation.
We identified pro-lymphangiogenic factors that are
expressed differentially in early CHS, in addition to have tissue
expression which parallels the increase and decrease of LEC
proliferation and lymphatic function. Our data also suggests
that the proliferation of LECs does not lead to the formation of
de novo vessels, but rather dilated vessels that could be the
cause of the inefficiency of lymphatic contractile pumping. In
addition, proliferative LECs may integrate into existing vessels
to repair damaged vessels in the inflamed skin. Lymphatic
vessels repair possibly requires a dynamic balance between
proliferation and vessel regression, similar to that well known
and studies in blood vessel angiogenesis [25–27].
We identified that the superficial collecting lymphatic vessels
in the inflamed skin regions do not show change in architecture
during inflammation, but instead found extravasation of ICG￾laden lymph that may be indicative of lymphatic vessel
leakiness associated incorporation of with proliferative LECs.
Mendez et al. also found that, in acute CHS in the rat foreleg,
lymphatic drainage is reduced as shown by interstitial
spreading of dye [24].
The peripheral lymphatic system drains excess interstitial
fluid back to the blood circulation, but also directs the transport
of immune cells. Inflammation impacts lymph drainage and the

volume of lymph propelled by lymphatic contraction [23,24].
Herein, we demonstrated that the contractility of the lymphatic
vessel efferent to the inflamed area is not affected by the
inflammation, but that the effectiveness of the lymphatic
pumping is reduced as shown by the backflow observed at day
3 post-CHS and the decrease in ejected dye after contraction.
Nitric oxide (NO) is known to affect the lymphatic function
through changes in local concentration. Liao et al. proposed
that iNOS produced by CD11b+ recruited to the inflamed area
promote relaxation of the lymphatic vessels which render the
contractions incapable of effectively propelling lymph [23].
Studies in isolated lymphatic vessels have shown that large
changes in NO level inhibit contractility and that small change
in local concentration influences contraction strength [28,29].
These local changes in NO productions are regulated by the
shear forces in the vessel to induce the subsequent
contractions [30]. In addition, Scallan et al. found that
endothelial NO synthase deficient mice have a decrease in
contraction amplitude. In our studies, we observed changes in
the contraction amplitude or strength localized to the site of
inflammation [28]. This effect was not systemic as indicated by
the normal transport of the lymph on the counter lateral,
untreated sides of treated animals. Our results support the
conclusions of Liao et al. by showing that (i) lymph does not
exit lymphangions as efficiently at day 3 post-CHS as
compared to pre-treatment and that (ii) this effect is seen only
in the inflamed side indicating a local, rather than systematic
effect. From our data and the work of others, we can
hypothesize that in CHS regulation of local levels of NO, vessel
dilation, and shear force within the vessel could regulate the
lymphatic flow.
Most studies of lymphangiogenesis have focused on the role
of the VEGF family members in this process. Expression of
VEGF-A in the skin was found to cause chronic inflammation
after induction of CHS which in turned promoted
lymphangiogenesis in the inflamed tissue [5]. Both VEGF-C
and VEGF-D expression in the skin have been reported to
increase the lymphatic vessel size and number [4]. In contrast,
Goldman et al. found that VEGF-C did not promote
lymphangiogenesis in the skin but had only transient effect on
the vasculature [31]. To investigate those factors which are
potentially are responsible for promoting LECs proliferation
during CHS, we compared the tissue expression levels of
proteins at day 3 post-CHS challenge with both non-treated
animals and animals at day 7 post CHS treatment. We only
included the dermis in our tissue lysate to determine growth
factors that locally affect the lymphatic vessels in concordance
with LEC proliferation. As observed by Halin et al., we also
found an increase in VEGF-A expression in inflamed skin at
day 3 as compared to the non-treated animals (Figure 6) [5].
Figure 5. Lymphatic flow measurement using near infrared dye ICG. A-D Mice were injected I.D. with IGC at the base of the
tail to quantify the contractility and qualify the ejection fraction of the lymph at days 0(A), 3(B), and 7(C) of post-CHS in the
contralateral view at day 3(D) (N=3). Selected frames are showed from the same sample mice to illustrate the changes that occur in
the lymphatic flow. Spatio-temporal fluorescent intensity maps are shown to visualize the ejection fraction of the ICG dye. We
observed that mice pre-treatment (A), at day 7 post-CHS (B) or the contralateral side at day 3post-CHS (D) have forward flow, but
that at day 3 (C) on the side of inflammation the lymph flow is perturbed and shows backflow.

To our surprise we did not observe a significant change in
VEGF-C or VEGF-D expression at day 3 compared to non￾treated and day 7 post-CHS. In a different model of UVB
irradiation, VEGF-C level in the skin was observed to be
reduced while the lymphatic vessels enlarged [32]. In our
studies, Angiopoietin-2, G-CSF, sALK-1, Amphiregulin,
endothelin-1, HGF, PLGF-2, MIP-1α, VEGF-A, TNFα, and KC/
CXCL17 were upregulated at day 3 compared to both day 7
post-CHS and in untreated animals. Of the eleven proteins
whose profiles followed changes in the LEC proliferation and
lymphatic dysfunction, HGF, FGF-2, PLGF-2, Angiopoietin-2,
and G-CSF have previously been associated with lymphatic
vessel hyperplasia and inducing LECs proliferation [17,33–35].
Interestingly, KC/CXCL17 is a chemokine with anti￾inflammatory effects that attenuates the expression of pro￾inflammatory genes such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as iNOS
[36]. These factors may act directly or indirectly on the LECs to
promote proliferation, vessel remodeling, and influence
lymphatic flow potentially in a VEGF-C and -D independent
manner.
Our data suggest that lymphatic vessels are remodeled and
LECs proliferate in CHS. In addition, CHS induces a local
reduction in lymphatic transport through the expression of
growth factors and chemokines, which promote vessel dilation
and leakiness and/or through the changes in local shear forces.
Our study indicates that there is a need to investigate further
the importance of other factors such as KC/CXCL17 on
lymphatic function and proliferation.

Figure S1. Use of viability Dye Calcein Am is required to
identify LECs from skin tissue. Others have used flow
cytometry and lymphatic markers to identify LECs in the tissue,
but did not use viability dye to discriminate non cellular events.
We found that less than 50% of the events that were the
CD45-/CD31+/podoplanin+ did not incorporate Calcein Am.
This finding indicates that regular discrimination on Forward
and Side scatter are not sufficient to eliminate debris and that
the use of viability dyes such as Calcein AM is required to
correctly quantify and identify LECs in the skin tissue. We show
a sample plot of the events that are podoplanin+/CD31+ which
we gated on SSC and FSC and for lack of CD45 staining (left
plot). We then selected the double positive events and looked
for the percentage of cells that also stained for Calcein AM. We
observed that only 35.6% of the cells in the podoplanin+/
CD31+ gate are actually live cells.
