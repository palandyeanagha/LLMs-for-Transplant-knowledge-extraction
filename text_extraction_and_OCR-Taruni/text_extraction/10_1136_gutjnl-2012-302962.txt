ABSTRACT
Objective & design Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) is a clinical condition that refers to progressive
histological changes ranging from simple steatosis (SS)
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We evaluated
the status of cytosine methylation (5mC) of liver
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in selected regions of the
mtDNA genome, such as D-loop control region, and
mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT￾ND6) and cytochrome C oxidase I (MT-CO1), to contrast
the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications play a role
in the phenotypic switching from SS to NASH.
Methods We studied liver biopsies obtained from
patients with NAFLD in a case-control design; 45
patients and 18 near-normal liver-histology subjects.
Results MT-ND6 methylation was higher in the liver of
NASH than SS patients (p<0.04) and MT-ND6
methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA ratio was
significantly associated with NAFLD activity score
(p<0.02). Liver MT-ND6 mRNA expression was
significantly decreased in NASH patients (0.26±0.30)
versus SS (0.74±0.48), p<0.003, and the protein level
was also diminished. The status of liver MT-ND6
methylation in NASH group was inversely correlated with
the level of regular physical activity (R=-0.54, p<0.02).
Hepatic methylation levels of D-Loop and MT-CO1 were
not associated with the disease severity. DNA (cytosine￾5) methyltransferase 1 was significantly upregulated in
NASH patients (p<0.002). Ultrastructural evaluation
showed that NASH is associated with mitochondrial
defects and peroxisome proliferation.
Conclusion Hepatic methylation and transcriptional
activity of the MT-ND6 are associated with the
histological severity of NAFLD. Epigenetic changes of
mtDNA are potentially reversible by interventional
programs, as physical activity could modulate the
methylation status of MT-ND6.
INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clin￾ical condition that refers to potentially progressive
histological changes ranging from fatty liver alone
(simple steatosis, SS) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), a disease stage characterised by liver cell
injury, a mixed inflammatory lobular infiltrate and
variable fibrosis.1 Clinical data do not necessarily
parallel the magnitude of the histological lesions
and the histological stages are hardly distinguished
without confirmation by a liver biopsy. Epidemio￾logical data reveal that patients with SS usually
have a benign prognosis in contrast to patients with
NASH, who can progress to cirrhosis and,
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ The role of mitochondria and mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) in metabolic-syndrome related
phenotypes has long been recognised.
▸ The molecular mechanisms associated with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
progression are still unknown, but the evidence
strongly suggests that mitochondrial
dysfunction might be critically involved in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD progression.
What are the new findings?
▸ We answered the question whether mtDNA
methylation plays a role in the molecular changes
that mediate the transition from one state
without liver injury (simple steatosis) to a more
aggressive disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis);
the status of 5mC of human mtDNA in the liver
tissue was never explored before.
▸ We observed that mitochondrially encoded NADH
dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) is highly methylated
in the liver of NASH patients but not in patients
with simple steatosis, and the status of
methylation significantly impacts on the MT-ND6
transcriptional regulation, an effect probably
dependent on the enhanced expression of the
mitochondrial-targeted isoform of the DNA
(cytosine-5) methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1).
▸ Liver MT-ND6 transcriptional activity and
protein expression were significantly decreased
in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, suggesting that
the expression of this mitochondrial gene,
which is regulated by an epigenetic
modification, may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of the disease progression.
▸ Our results also show that the status of MT-ND6
cytosine methylation is potentially inducible by
environmental factors, such as life style
intervention.

eventually, to hepatocellular carcinoma.2 Remarkably, evidence
from clinical trials showed that hepatic steatosis and lobular
inflammation are potentially reversible;3 however, the molecular
mechanisms by which the histological lesions could be reverted
are still unknown.
In addition, although the understanding of the mechanisms
related with the disease progression remains a major challenge,
some evidence exists on the molecular pathways that might con￾tribute to the phenotypic switching from one state without liver
injury (SS) to a more aggressive disease (NASH). For instance,
hepatocyte apoptosis, lipotoxicity, and oxidative stress4–6 are
plausible molecular mediators of cellular injury, inflammatory
recruitment, and fibrogenesis. Interestingly, the above-mentioned
molecular pathways converge into a common point: mitochon￾drial dysfunction, which critically determines the activity of the
oxidative phosphorylation cascade, and is associated with early
proapoptotic events, defects in fatty acid oxidation, and impaired
insulin signalling.
Earlier evidence indicated that whereas insulin resistance,
increased fatty acid β oxidation, and hepatic oxidative stress are
present in both SS and NASH, only NASH is associated with
mitochondrial structural and molecular defects.7 In addition,
patients with NASH have a significantly decreased activity of
mitochondria respiratory chain complexes.8 Therefore, the evi￾dence strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is
involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD progression. Although
some evidence from animal studies is emerging,9 the molecular
mechanisms leading to liver mitochondrial dysfunction in
human NASH are still unknown.
Defects of the mitochondrial genome are widely recognised
as responsible of mitochondrial dysfunction as mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) critically controls the mitochondrial gene
expression machinery.10 Until very recently, mutations and dele￾tions of mtDNA were the only mechanisms to explain changes
in the transcriptional mitochondrial profile. Recent evidence
showed that an isoform of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
is targeted to mtDNA and appears to be responsible for mtDNA
methylation of cytosine at the carbon-5 position (5mC), in CpG
dinucleotides, which in turn regulates mitochondrial function
and gene transcription.11 Hence, the presence of 5mC in
human mtDNA led us to question whether this epigenetic modi￾fication might play a role in the molecular changes that explain
why NASH is progressive and SS is not. Therefore, in this study,
we evaluated the status of cytosine modifications of liver
mtDNA in selected regions of the mtDNA genome, such as the
displacement loop (D-loop), the mitochondrially encoded
NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6), and cytochrome C oxidase
I (MT-CO1 or COX1), because a previous report showed that
methylation of mtDNA is nonrandom,12 and Shock et al
showed that the CpG-dependent interaction of DNMT1 with
the mitochondrial genome occurs in specific points, which sig￾nificantly affects the mitochondrial transcriptional machinery.11
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
To explore the role of liver mtDNA methylation in the modula￾tion of the histological disease severity, we studied liver biopsies
obtained from 45 unrelated adult NAFLD patients, including 23
patients with SS and 22 patients with NASH. Patients were con￾sidered for inclusion if they had histopathological evidence of
fatty liver disease, either SS or NASH, on liver biopsy per￾formed within the study period.
Moreover, to understand to what extent liver mtDNA methy￾lation might modulate metabolic syndrome (MS)-associated phe￾notypes, the livers of 18 subjects without MS (Non-MS-near
normal liver histology) were included in this study, in a case￾control design. Subjects without MS were selected from patients
attending the Liver Unit, whose age and sex matched the NAFLD
patients; liver specimens were obtained by percutaneous liver
biopsy, and the reason for performing a liver biopsy in these sub￾jects was based on the presence of persistently mildly elevated
serum liver enzymes activity. In all the Non-MS-near normal liver
histology subjects, all causes of common liver disease were ruled
out, and they were included in the study if they did not have
histological evidence of fatty change; the histological diagnosis of
control livers was minimal changes or mild cholestasis. Surgical
liver biopsies were avoided because significant changes in gene
expression were previously reported in the frame of surgical
stress.13
The case participants and the Non-MS-near normal liver hist￾ology subjects were selected during the same study period from
the same population of patients attending the Liver Unit, and all
of them share the same demographic characteristics (occupation,
educational level, place of residence, and ethnicity).
More details can be found in the online supplementary
material.
All the investigations performed in this study were conducted
in accordance with the guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of
Helsinki. Written consent from individuals was obtained in
accordance with the procedures approved by the Ethical
Committee of our institution.
Physical, anthropometric, and biochemical evaluation
Health examinations included anthropometric measurements, a
questionnaire on health-related behaviours and biochemical
determinations as previously described.14 Details about physical,
anthropometric and biochemical evaluation are shown in
table 1. Regular physical activity was defined as all forms of
activity, such as walking or cycling for everyday journeys, active
play, work-related activity, active recreation such as working out
in a gym, dancing, or competitive sport and the overall amount
of activity was expressed in hours/week; there was no specific
exercise intervention, and data about regular physical activity
was surveyed at baseline by the time of liver biopsy.
Liver biopsy and histopathological evaluation
The degree of steatosis was assessed according to the system
developed by Kleiner et al based on the percentage of hepato￾cytes containing macrovesicular fat droplets.15 NASH1 and
Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ Mitochondrial epigenetics is a novel mechanism to
understand the pathobiology of complex diseases such as
NAFLD and other diseases with a mitochondrial dysfunction
involvement.
▸ Lifestyle changes such as regular physical activity might
modulate the status of hepatic DNA methylation of MT-ND6.
▸ Because of the inherent plasticity of epigenetic
modifications, either physiologically or pathologically
produced, the epigenetic regulation of liver MT-ND6 in NASH
patients might have therapeutic potential.

reported; a NAS threshold of five was used for further compari￾sons with variables of interest.15 More details can be found in
the online supplementary material.
Liver immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed on liver specimens of NAFLD
patients previously included in paraffin. Details about immunos￾taining can be found in the online supplementary material.
Electron microscopy (EM) of the liver tissues
Electron microscopy studies were performed on liver specimens
by immersion of a small sample (1 mm) in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4); sections were mounted
in copper grids, counterstained with lead citrate, and observed
in a transmission electronic microscope (Zeiss E.M. 10C) by
experienced electron microscopists (RFM and CFL).
Bisulfite treatment of DNA and methylation-specific PCR
Briefly, this technique is based on the bisulfite treatment of
genomic DNA, thereby converting all the unmethylated cytosines
to uracils, while conserving the methylated cytosines, using the
EZ DNA Methylation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Zymo Research Corporation, Orange, CA, USA). The
level of methylated DNA is expressed as the ratio of the estimated
amount for methylated DNA to the unmethylated DNA levels,
calculated for each sample using the fluorescence threshold cycle
(Ct) values for a previously estimated efficiency.16 More details
can be found in the online supplementary material.

The quantitative data were expressed as mean±SD, unless other￾wise indicated. Because a significant variance difference was
observed between the groups for most of the variables and as

to be conservative and assessed the differences between the
groups by using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-or
Kruskal–Wallis tests. For multiple regression analysis or

RESULTS
Mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 6 is highly
methylated in the liver of NASH patients
Our first approach was to explore the association between the
hepatic 5mC of the D-loop, MT-ND6 and MT-CO1 (sequence
details can be found in the Online only material) and the
histological disease severity. Thus, we compared the levels of
5mC of the DNA of the mitochondrial genes in the liver of
patients with SS versus patients with NASH. Interestingly, we
observed that liver MT-ND6 methylated DNA/unmethylated
DNA ratio was significantly associated with NASH (p<0.04,
even after adjusting by HOMA-IR; figure 1A), showing that
28.4% of alleles were methylated in NASH versus 20.6% in SS.
Likewise, liver MT-ND6 methylation levels were significantly
associated with the NAS score (figure 1A), showing that the
ratio of MT-ND6 methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA levels is
higher in patients with a NAS score above 5.
In addition, by grouping the dependant variable according to
the severity of liver fibrosis as absent or mild (F0-F1) and mod￾erate or severe (F2-F3), we observed a significant association

with the status of liver MT-ND6 methylation, showing that
patients with more advanced fibrosis had higher levels of liver
MT-ND6 methylation (figure 1A). Despite the degree of stea￾tosis was significantly higher in the NASH group compared
with SS patients, liver MT-ND6 methylation status was not dif￾ferent among patients with mild (degree<or =33%) and
patients with moderate or severe (>33%) fatty liver infiltration
(figure 1A), suggesting that the observed effect was not related
to the extent of steatosis. Likewise, lobular inflammation was
not associated with liver MT-ND6 methylation status
(figure 1A).
On the contrary, the histological disease severity was not asso￾ciated either with the ratio of D-Loop (19.6% of methylated
alleles in SS vs 17.7% in NASH) or MT-CO1 methylated DNA/
unmethylated DNA levels (1.5% of methylated alleles in SS vs
0.7% in NASH; figure 1B). Then, MT-CO1 was mostly
unmethylated in the liver of NAFLD patients as well as in the
Non-MS subjects, which is consistent with what was previously
found for this particular gene in another system.11 There was a
preferential cytosine methylation of the MT-ND6 over the
D-Loop region in NASH with respect to SS patients (ratio: 1.01
±0.65 vs 1.77±0.86, p<0.009) demonstrating that these mito￾chondrial genes were differently affected by changes in cytosine
methylation of mtDNA.
In fact, the ratio of MT-ND6 methylated/methylated D-Loop
levels was significantly higher in patients with moderate or
severe fibrosis (1.83±0.72) in comparison with patients with
absent or mild (1.23±0.85), p<0.05.
We further evaluated whether the status of hepatic 5mC of the
targeted mitochondrial genes was associated with metabolic
stressors such as peripheral insulin resistance (measured by
HOMA-IR), hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyper￾cholesterolaemia; for this purpose, we included liver samples of
the Non-MS-near normal liver histology group in the analysis
(table 1). Surprisingly, we observed a significant inverse correl￾ation between the hepatic MT-CO1 methylated DNA/unmethy￾lated DNA ratio and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
levels (R=−0.42, p<0.004), and a significant association
between MT-CO1 methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA
(R=0.34, p<0.01) and BMI.
Lifestyle changes such as regular physical activity might
modulate the status of hepatic DNA methylation of MT-ND6
Recent evidence suggests that regular physical activity is able
to modulate hepatic fat content,17–19 and potentially influ￾ences NAFLD severity.20 Exercise also involves changes and
adaptation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in skel￾etal muscle by increasing the amount of mitochondrial pro￾teins and direct stimulation of OXPHOS complexes.21 Thus,
we explored in the whole population ( patients and
Non-MS-near normal liver histology subjects, n=64) whether
regular exercise could have an impact on the levels of 5mC in
the selected mitochondrial genes, and we observed that
MT-ND6 methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA ratio was
inversely correlated with the level of physical activity mea￾sured in h/week (Pearson’s correlation coefficient R=−0.30,
p<0.04). The analysis was in addition restricted to the NASH
group, and interestingly, we observed and even strong inverse
correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient R=−0.54,
p<0.02). Nevertheless, carefully controlled lifestyle interven￾tion programs will better define the impact of epigenetic
changes on human NAFLD progression.
Functional assessment of the impact of MT-ND6
methylation on NASH pathobiology: 1-Liver MT-ND6
transcription and protein levels are significantly reduced
in patients with NASH
To further evaluate whether the transcriptional activity of liver
MT-ND6 is associated with NAFLD severity, we measured the
mRNA relative abundance in the liver of patients with NASH
and SS. Interestingly, we observed that the liver of NASH
patients shows significantly reduced MT-ND6 mRNA levels in
comparison with SS (figure 2), and NAS score was significantly
(p<0.007) and negatively correlated (Spearman R: −0.50) with
MT-ND6 mRNA levels in the whole population of patients with
NAFLD. In addition, liver abundance of MT-ND6 mRNA was
significantly reduced in patients with a more severe histological
disease (fibrosis moderate or severe F2-3), figure 2, suggesting
that the transcriptional activity of the MT-ND6 is strongly asso￾ciated with the histological severity of NAFLD.
Furthermore, liver expression pattern of MT-ND6 protein
was evaluated according to the histological disease severity of
NAFLD, and we observed lower levels of liver MT-ND6 expres￾sion in patients with NASH in comparison with those showing
SS (figure 2). Overall, positive staining for MT-ND6 was easily
identified in hepatocyte cytoplasma showing a pattern, primarily
but not exclusively restricted to regions surrounding lipid dro￾plets (figure 2), showing that DNA methylation of MT-ND6 is
accompanied by a decrease in its protein level.
In addition, we evaluated the levels of MT-CO1 mRNA in the
liver of NAFLD patients and non-significant differences were
observed between the two groups (figure 2).
Then, the ratio MT-ND6 mRNA/MT-CO1 mRNA ratio was
significantly diminished in NASH versus SS patients (0.49±0.69
vs 1.12±0.45, p<0.002) demonstrated that these mitochondrial
genes were differently affected by changes in cytosine methyla￾tion of mtDNA in relation with disease severity. Accordingly,
this MT-ND6 mRNA/MT-CO1 mRNA ratio was inversely corre￾lated with NAS score (Spearman R: −0.60, p<0.0006).
2-Hepatic expression of the DNMT1 is significantly higher
in the liver of NASH patients: a mechanistic explanation
DNMT1 is regarded as the maintenance DNA methyltransferase
because of its critical role in the establishment and regulation of
tissue-specific patterns of methylated cytosine residues. In add￾ition, DNMT1 is the only member of the DNA methyltransfer￾ase family found to have an isoform targeted to the
mitochondria.11 In this study, we examined the liver transcrip￾tional activity of the DNMT1 isoform among NAFLD patients
in order to answer the question whether its expression is higher
in patients suffering from NASH. We were able to demonstrate

NASH is associated with changes in mitochondrial
morphology and peroxisome proliferation
Mitochondrial morphology is not only critical for maintaining
optimal mitochondrial function but also crucially linked to
energy metabolism and OXPHOS function.22 23 Hence, we
examined sections of the liver tissue by EM and, notably, in the
hepatocytes of NASH patients, we found that mitochondrial
morphology was considerably altered and characterised by struc￾tural defects, such as mitochondria with loss of their inner
membrane and deep infoldings, known as cristae and also loss
of the typical dense mitochondrial granules, and larger

DISCUSSION
In this study, we asked whether epigenetic modifications of
mtDNA in the liver tissue play a role in the histological disease
severity of NAFLD. Actually, 5mC of mtDNA seems to be a crit￾ical and potentially reversible mechanism of mitochondrial tran￾scriptional control, but its role in the pathogenesis of human
diseases has never been studied before.
We provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that methy￾lation of MT-ND6 in the liver is higher in NASH than in SS
patients. In addition, liver MT-ND6 transcriptional activity and
protein expression were significantly decreased in NASH with
respect to SS patients, suggesting that the expression of this
mitochondrial gene, which is regulated by an epigenetic modifi￾cation, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the
disease progression. Moreover, we observed higher levels of
DNMT1 mRNA in the liver of NASH patients. On the contrary,
we observed that liver methylation levels of MT-CO1 and
D-Loop were unrelated to the severity of NAFLD, with hepatic
MT-CO1 almost completely unmethylated.
Why could the regulation of hepatic MT-ND6 be relevant
in the pathogenesis of NAFLD progression?
Mutational analysis and in vivo studies showed that of the 13
proteins encoded by the mtDNA, only MT-ND6 (encoded by
the light strand of the mtDNA) is an essential component of
complex I.24 Therefore, maintaining adequate levels of
MT-ND6 is critical for the proper assembly of complex I,25
which is the largest enzyme complex of the OXPHOS system
and defects of which result in mitochondrial dysfunction.26 27
Immunohistochemical staining for the MT-ND6 subunit has
proven to be useful in identifying partial complex I disassem￾bly28; hence, this observation reinforces our findings about sig￾nificantly decreased hepatic protein expression of MT-ND6 in
NASH patients might have functional implications.
Thus, the biological evidence mentioned earlier strongly suggest
that the regulation of MT-ND6 transcription, either by a direct
effect or by modulation of the complex I activity significantly
affects mitochondrial physiology and a number of key mitochon￾drial functions that could be involved in NAFLD progression.
The ultrastructural changes observed in the liver mitochon￾drion of NASH patients support our hypothesis about the poten￾tial association between disruption of the transcriptional activity
of MT-ND6 and mitochondrial dysfunction because morpho￾logical changes such as loss of mitochondrial cristae and changes
in mitochondrial shape and size are often associated with
OXPHOS defects and decreased mitochondrial protein expres￾sion.29 Remarkably, loss of mitochondrial infoldings was previ￾ously observed by Sanyal A et al7 in NASH patients but not in SS
patients, and other mitochondrial disturbances, such as intrami￾tochondrial crystals (figure 3), seem to be characteristics of
NASH.30
Furthermore, we observed increased peroxisome proliferation
in NASH patients, a finding reported to be a response to mito￾chondrial dysfunction.31
We might wonder about what factors could influence liver
mtDNA methylation of selected genes in the context of
NAFLD. Actually, in this study, we cannot show or demonstrate
a cause-effect relation because the human mtDNMT1 isoform
was very recently discovered.11 and there is scarce data about its
regulation. However, the evidence suggests that this locus is
strongly influenced by oxidative stress,11 a common finding in
NASH. It is therefore possible that a some liver molecular
events, such as lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and local hypoxia,
could influence the behaviour of the epigenetic modifications of
the liver mitochondrial genome. Taken together, our data invite
us to speculate that methylation and decreased transcription of
liver MT-ND6 participates in the molecular events associated
with the histological progression of human NAFLD.
Remarkably, our results also showed that the status of
MT-ND6 cytosine methylation is potentially modified by envir￾onmental factors, such as physical activity, an attainable lifestyle
intervention. This unexpected finding leads us to question
whether the epigenetic regulation of liver MT-ND6 in NASH
patients might have any therapeutic potential. Because of the
inherent plasticity of epigenetic modifications, either physiolo￾gically or pathologically produced, we are optimistic that thera￾peutic approaches and quick interventions are able to modify
the natural history of NAFLD. We might also hypothesise that
the reversion of liver inflammation by vitamin E3 could be asso￾ciated with modulation of the mitochondrial transcriptional
activity as α tocopherol is able to restore the mitochondrial
respiratory enzymatic activity.32 This reasoning may also be
applicable to other vitamins such as folic acid, which partici￾pates in the methyl donor metabolism that improves hyperho￾mocysteinaemia, a well-known cardiovascular risk factor.33
Finally, in this study, we also explored the impact of epigenetic
modifications of liver mtDNA on the MS-associated traits.
Analysing methylation levels of the target genes in the liver of
Non-MS subjects, in comparison with NAFLD patients, we
observed that the hepatic MT-CO1 methylation status was signifi￾cantly associated with the subjects’ BMI and plasma HDL choles￾terol levels. These findings, despite being unexpected, raise
interesting questions about the role of hepatic mtDNA methyla￾tion on the pathogenesis of intermediate phenotypes associated
with the MS, and suggest that fatty liver is not an innocent
bystander comorbidity but seems to play a critical role in the sys￾temic abnormalities associated with atherosclerosis.34–36
In conclusion, our study shows that epigenetic control and
transcriptional activity of mitochondrially-encoded mitochon￾drial genes, such as MT-ND6, might be involved in the patho￾genesis of NAFLD progression. Although the cross-sectional
nature of our study does not allow us to prove the impact of
changes in mtDNA methylation on the reversibility of the histo￾logical lesions, some clues about the putative molecular events
that could modulate the severity of the disease are suggested. In
addition, our study supports the notion of the complex nature
of the NAFLD pathogenesis, which requires a dynamic balance
between genetic and environmental factors that potentially
operate at the epigenetic level in order to modulate its natural
history. Liver mitochondria and, in turn, the dysfunction of the
OXPHOS system might participate in the phenotypic switching
from SS to NASH.
