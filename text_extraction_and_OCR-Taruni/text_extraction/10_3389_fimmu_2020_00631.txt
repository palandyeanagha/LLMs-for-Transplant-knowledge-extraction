Organ transplantation is undergoing profound changes. Contraindications for donation
have been revised in order to better meet the organ demand. The use of lower-quality
organs and organs with greater preoperative damage, including those from donation after
cardiac death (DCD), has become an established routine but increases the risk of graft
malfunction. This risk is further aggravated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the
process of transplantation. These circumstances demand a preservation technology that
ameliorates IRI and allows for assessment of viability and function prior to transplantation.
Oxygenated hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (MP) have emerged
as valid novel modalities for advanced organ preservation and conditioning. Ex vivo
prolonged lung preservation has resulted in successful transplantation of high-risk
donor lungs. Normothermic MP of hearts and livers has displayed safe (heart) and
superior (liver) preservation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Normothermic kidney
preservation for 24 h was recently established. Early clinical outcomes beyond the market
entry trials indicate bioenergetics reconditioning, improved preservation of structures
subject to IRI, and significant prolongation of the preservation time. The monitoring
of perfusion parameters, the biochemical investigation of preservation fluids, and the
assessment of tissue viability and bioenergetics function now offer a comprehensive
assessment of organ quality and function ex situ. Gene and protein expression profiling,
investigation of passenger leukocytes, and advanced imaging may further enhance the
understanding of the condition of an organ during MP. In addition, MP offers a platform
for organ reconditioning and regeneration and hence catalyzes the clinical realization
of tissue engineering. Organ modification may include immunological modification and
the generation of chimeric organs. While these ideas are not conceptually new, MP
now offers a platform for clinical realization. Defatting of steatotic livers, modulation
of inflammation during preservation in lungs, vasodilatation of livers, and hepatitis C
elimination have been successfully demonstrated in experimental and clinical trials.
Targeted treatment of lesions and surgical treatment or graft modification have been
attempted. In this review, we address the current state of MP and advanced organ
monitoring and speculate about logical future steps and how this evolution of a novel
technology can result in a medial revolution.

INTRODUCTION
The velocity and significance of progress in transplantation
started to decrease around the turn of the century. Up until
that point, the number of transplantations performed was
ever-increasing, and the outcomes continued to improve. The
clinical benefit to the patient from the immediate and effective
treatment of organ failure was defined by improved patient
survival. Patient survival as an endpoint followed by graft survival
as a surrogate and indicator of judicious organ attribution
were the framework of significant momentum that succeeded
in making transplantation a standard of care. This success
was fueled, however, not only by the healthcare quality gain
but also by a flourishing industry producing high-quality and
expensive immunosuppressive medication—to be taken for life
after transplantation (1–3).
The honeymoon period came to an end when both donor
rates and short-term results stagnated. The established endpoints
for clinical trials are difficult to improve in the short run
after transplantation, and the field was slow in anticipating
and responding to the changing circumstances—specifically
the shortage of standard criteria donors (SCD). The field of
transplantation now finds itself in very difficult circumstances:
90%+ patient and graft survival rates leave little room for
improvement but also little room for error. At the same
time, the conditions and circumstances in organ donation are
radically changing, with increasing donor age and comorbidities
and donation from non-heart-beating donors. In countries
spearheading the evolution, donation after cardiac death (DCD)
and extended criteria donor (ECD) organs make up more than
50% of the organ pool. With the pressure to maintain and further
improve the excellent short- and long-term results, but working
with very different resources, the most prominent immediate
challenge is to better define and preserve, if not improve, organ
quality in transplantation.

With this as a driving force, modalities to prolong and
improve preservation together with the tools to assess organ
quality and function are emerging as the new frontier. Beyond
serving an immediate medical need, the technologies evolving
herald a more fundamental potential for change in healthcare:
with the extracorporeal long-term preservation and assessment
of organs, the capability for human organ treatment and repair
arises. Hence, 20 years after transplantation advanced to become
a standard of care, the field has the potential to play a key role and
add a chapter to healthcare once again (4–10).
In this review, we aim to address the current state of the
field. A clarification of the terminology and the definitions
of marginal organs, including an overview and comparison
between the definitions for each organ, shall help to provide
a better picture of the actual status. Considering the changing
circumstances, the actual impacts of a condition on organ quality
and function need to be addressed not only from the viewpoint
of an empirical correlation. The individual parameters need to be
further addressed for their reversibility and treatability. Building
on this concept, the various modalities of MP in their different
stages of development and actual benefit require a critical
reflection. While the assessment of organ quality and function
during extracorporeal perfusion is in its infancy, the growing
body of data may help to eventually develop a comprehensive
picture of the quality of the components of organs as relevant to
transplantation and beyond. An important focus in this context
is the assessment, definition, and relevance of the immune system
of organs if isolated from the human body. Immunomodulation
and immunomasking seem more realistic if attempted under
the conditions of an isolated and perfused organ. The vision
of a realization and refinement of the repair, treatment, and
modification of organs is starting to trigger a boost in interest
both in academia and in industry.
DEFINING “MARGINAL” ORGANS
In the light of organ shortage, critical reflection on the expansion
of the donor pool is essential. The definition of organs that are
marginal for transplantation is often considered a well-defined
entity. In reality, however, the definition is very different for each
organ, and there is incongruence between the various definitions.
It is clear and well-justifiable that different organs are considered
to be extended criteria organs going by different criteria, since the
relevance of one single factor may be very diverse. The assessment
of the outcome after transplantation of extended criteria organs,
however, needs to be seen and interpreted with reference to the
diverse definitions used throughout the years.
ECD Kidneys
The determination of ECD evolved from the term “marginal
donors,” and much of the literature focuses on criteria for living
donors. Since this is not the focus of this article, we will restrict
the research to deceased donors and deceased donor organs.
It is well-known that a number of factors may impact
the eventual outcome after transplantation. The definition of
cadaveric kidney organs marginal for transplantation emerged
from prioritization of and preference for factors that may outrank

other contributors in magnitude and simplicity of assessment
(11). In the deceased donor situation, the prior medical history
is not completely known, and the exact determination of
hypertension, for example, often remains incomplete regarding
details such as manifestation, duration, or response to treatment.
Some of the understanding of donor risk factors also stems from
living donors (12), where early definitions of marginal donors
relate to the risks for the recipient rather than the risk for the
donor, which was only assessed and understood much later.
Hence, the definition of marginal or ECD kidneys needs to be
used with caution since the definitions used are building on a set
of parameters that have not been formally established, validated,
and re-validated.
Still, compared to other organ systems in SOT, a comparatively
good definition of marginal or ECD has been established.
Noteworthily, the term “marginal” should be avoided in favor of
ECD, as “marginal” may be considered pejorative by the patients
who receive them and also by the programs that transplant
them (13).
The ECD criteria most widely used in kidney transplantation
are the OPTN-approved criteria, as described by Metzger et al.
(13). They are shown in Table 1.
A helpful tool that combines such parameters is the Kidney
Donor Risk Index (KDRI), which was generated by weighting the
following factors into a single number in order to predict the risk
of post-transplant graft failure: age, weight, height, race, history
of hypertension, history of diabetes, cause of death, hepatitis C
status, serum creatinine, and DCD. The association of KDRI
with the outcome in the Eurotransplant senior program (ESP)
was evaluated by Schamberger et al. (14). Kidney transplantation
from Maastricht category-III donors after circulatory death
(DCD), which introduces a higher risk of primary non-function
and delayed graft function (DGF), has been added to ECD
criteria (15). Furthermore, kidneys from a donor with an acute
kidney injury before organ procurement correspond to marginal
quality (16). Importantly, kidneys from donors with a history
of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have not been
addressed specifically but can be classified as marginal organs
since deteriorated microperfusion can be assumed (17–19).

ECD Livers
In liver transplantation, the term “marginal” does not refer to
a number of distinct internationally accepted criteria that could
characterize a graft, and nor does “ECD.” Instead, both terms
encompass a variety of factors that have been observed to limit
graft quality, but the impact of each of these factors remains
to be defined. Therefore, several models for the assessment of
the sum of such risk factors have been introduced (20). In this
regard, valuable predictive quality of patient and graft survival at
3 months was achieved using the Survival Outcomes Following
Liver Transplantation (SOFT) score (21). Death censored graft
survival at 60 months follow-up was well-predicted by the Donor
Risk Index (DRI; c-index 0.59) and Eurotransplant-DRI (c-index
0.58) (20).
Table 2 lists those criteria that overlap in the mentioned
scoring systems and that are widely applied when defining
“marginal” or “ECD” liver grafts (22, 23). Apart from clinical and
metric parameters, these include histological criteria, since liver
biopsies are considered helpful in order to evaluate the organ
quality. Whereas, liver fibrosis has been reported to predict a
high incidence of early graft failure (24), Liu et al. (25) suggested
a macrovesicular steatosis of 30 percent as a cutoff value for
marginal grafts.

Noteworthily, while livers from non-heart-beating donors are
per se considered as ECD, Mihylov et al. suggested criteria for
“ECD DCD” livers in order to subclassify DCD organs (26)
(Table 2).
ECD Pancreas
In analogy to other organs in SOT, no clear definition exists
for a “marginal” or ECD pancreas graft. Table 3 summarizes
the criteria that have been commonly used by various authors
(27–30). In an attempt to bring such criteria into a clinically
useful context, Axelrod et al. (31) presented a Pancreas Donor
Risk Index (PDR). The score builds a prediction model of graft
survival on donor factors together with ischemia time and type
of transplantation (31).
ECD Hearts
Due to the imminent gap between the supply of donor hearts
and the demand for transplantable organs, strategies have
emerged to overcome this clinical dilemma. The numbers of left
ventricular assist devices as bridge-to-transplant therapy have
significantly increased over the last decade. Simultaneously with
this trend, marginal or “extended criteria” hearts are routinely
evaluated in order to increase the donor pool. While standardized
criteria have not been published by societies so far, there is a
general consensus when it comes to the definition of marginal
donor hearts. The literature on this topic is primarily driven
by US data. A Meeting Report by the American Society on
Transplantation on adult cardiac transplantation is still lacking
a unified formal definition.

Based on the current literature, the factors that should be
considered as extended criteria in heart donation are given in
Table 4.
In order to facilitate a better risk-assessment of allografts,
donor profiles have been implemented in Risk Scores. Smits et al.
have identified 12 variables associated with donor non-use in
the Eurotransplant region and have generated the Eurotransplant
Heart Donor Score (32). Based on the UNOS database, a risk
score model (UNOS Donor Risk Score) has been developed by
Weiss et al. (33).
ECD Lungs
Based on the standard criteria donor lung definitions published
in 2003 by Orens et al. (34), one can define an ECD lung if
the donor does not fulfill at least one criterion of the SCD
criteria suggested by the International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation (Table 5).
MACHINE PERFUSION
The concept of MP was part of organ preservation long before
solid organ transplantation (SOT) started to become a clinical
reality and routine. With the publication by Collins et al., in
which the authors described a method for the transportation of
kidneys on ice using a preservation solution with the result that
the organs could be shipped in a small box and showed almost
no damage after 30 h, the era of static cold storage (SCS) had
begun (35). The implementation of SCS led to satisfactory results
within the entire field of SOT. However, with the increasing
use of organs procured from ECD and DCD, SCS alone is not
able to deliver the post-transplant results we aim to achieve for
our patients. The lack of oxygen, the continuation of anaerobic
metabolism leading to organ-damage and recipient-harming
IRI after reperfusion, is significantly pronounced and more
detrimental in these marginal donor organs (36).
Figure 1 illustrates the different possibilities for combining
all preservation techniques available today clinically for almost
all organs: static cold storage (as the golden standard,

FIGURE 1 | The past, present, and potential (near) future of organ preservation. Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with
good outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by
hypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion
(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a “back to hub”
approach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD
organ quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory
modifications and organ repair.
so far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and
normothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion
(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important
tool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The
following sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the
review is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.
However, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,
heart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups
in the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been
summarized by previous reviews (37–42).
Recently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted
after NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%
early allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ
procurements and comparable to donation after brain death
(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),
clear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way
similar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication
by Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the
results to an adequate prospectively organized control group.
It is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP
was established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a
restoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via
echocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output
measurements could be implemented (44).
Accepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after
weaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac
index >2.5 L/min/m2
; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular
ejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.
NRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and
helps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal
donor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to
compare DCD organ transplantation +/– NRP followed by +/–
a combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).
Since 2009, dynamic cold storage—hypothermic machine
perfusion (HMP)—has progressed to become clinical routine in
several fields of SOT—above all, in kidney preservation. Moers
et al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal
of Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF
rate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney
compared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way
(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental
oxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys
have followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:
ECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from
MP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is
reasonable (48–52). During the second half of the recent decade,
oxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.
In 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing
MP trials in kidney and liver transplantation, including those
assessing oxygenated HMP (53). One of these trials run by the
COPER
consortium (http://cope-eu.com/work%20programme/
trials.html) has finished recruiting, and 1-year-follow-up results
were presented during the American Transplant Congress 2019.
This international RCT on oxygenated HMP of DCD kidneys
included 197 kidney pairs, of which 106 were successfully
hypothermically perfused and transplanted. Approximately 80%
of the transplanted kidney pairs were eligible for the primary

analysis and resulted in a similar eGFR at 1 year after transplant
for oxygenated (HMPO) and standard HMP. Analysis of all￾cause graft failure, however, showed a higher eGFR in HMPO
than in HMP. Overall graft loss was significantly lower in HMPO,
leading the authors to suggest that HMPO improves 1-year
kidney graft function when accounting for the beneficial effect
on allograft survival.
In contrast, in the field of pancreas transplantation,
dynamic preservation technologies have not yet experienced
a breakthrough. Neither hypothermic nor NMP technologies
are well-established, and SCS remains the standard procedure.
A recent review outlined nine studies on HMP and 10 studies
on NMP. All of them were experimental; none of the human
pancreatic grafts were transplanted. However, the common
conclusion of all of the published articles considered was that
IRI, thrombosis, and morbidity after whole organ pancreas
transplantation might be reduced by both technologies (54–56).
Liver transplantation can be regarded as the field in SOT that
primarily focuses on the development of preservation techniques,
currently. The most commonly used perfusion types in the
daily routine are HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion),
D-HOPE (d for dual oxygenation via hepatic artery and portal
vein), and normothermic liver preservation. HOPE and D￾HOPE studies have produced promising results, showing higher
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during preservation, less
IRI, excellent graft survival after DCD liver transplantation,
and a significantly reduced rate of bile duct injuries (57–60).
The Birmingham group was the first to publish its experiences
on livers undergoing HOPE and NMP consecutively (61).
Although such livers were not transplanted, HOPE/NMP livers
developed less oxidative injury and inflammation and achieved
enhanced metabolic recovery compared to livers undergoing
NMP only (61). Liver NMP had its great appearance when the
first prospective international multicenter RCT was published in
April 2018 (62). The trial on DBD and DCD livers with NMP
durations up to 24 h could show a significantly lower level of graft
injury, measured by reduced peak aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), longer preservation times, and a 50% lower discard rate of
organs compared to SCS. Bile duct complications and graft and
patient survival were comparable in both groups (62).
NMP has been shown to be beneficial in terms of immediate
graft function in all organ types in which it has been explored
clinically: this includes the kidney (63–65), liver (62, 66), and
the lung (67, 68). The mechanism by which this occurs has not
yet been conclusively proven, but the concept is that reperfusion
(rewarming and oxygen delivery) in the artificial context of the
perfusion circuit is beneficial by allowing recovery of cellular
energetics in the absence of the effector mechanisms needed for
an acute inflammatory response (as in ischemia-reperfusion).
ORGAN PRESERVATION VS. ORGAN
CONDITIONING VS. ORGAN REPAIR
With a new technology, the accompanying terminology is often
somewhat unspecific and unprecise in the beginning. This also
applies to MP. It is paramount, however, to eventually clarify the
terminology and define a uniformity for its correct use. Simply
put, no other terminology than organ preservation would be
justified at this point in the clinical application, since no targeted
means for organ reconditioning (let alone repair) have been
established. While this remains a glorious goal for the future,
it also represents a significant legal and ethical challenge, since
the framework for the treatment of human organs remains to
be established. It remains entirely unclear whether extracorporal
organ reconditioning and/or repair can be achieved. The hope
and the hype are building on a growing body of experimental
data that indicates the feasibility of success or organ-specific
treatment. While this remains a most significant opportunity for
the field, we herein aim to adequately define organ preservation,
organ (re-)conditioning, and organ treatment.
Organ Preservation—A Definition
It is interesting to note that no entry exists on organ preservation
in Wikipedia (search, 21.08.2019), while a PubMed search
yields 17189 entries (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?
term=organ+preservation). It seems to be a term where the
definition appears so clear and easy that it does not need to
be written down. Yet again, a uniform description of organ
preservation is not straightforward since it is not necessarily
defined by organ retrieval, temperature, metabolic state, or any
other sole condition. The one possible common ground for a
definition is the purpose. Putting an organ into a state that
allows later reactivation and restitution of its original function
with the aim of minimizing damage during the period of mal￾and non-perfusion.
One essential limiting factor in the determination of the
quality of the preservation method is the poor definition of
endpoint for a clinical readout. Primary non-function (PNF)
seems relatively well-defined at first glance, but the actual
definitions leave room for interpretation. PNF does not indicate
no organ function at all but rather a function insufficient to
prevent/avoid longer-term organ replacement therapy.
For example, in liver transplantation, according to Ploeg
et al., PNF is defined by poor initial function, requiring re￾transplantation or leading to death within 7 days after the
primary procedure without any identifiable cause of graft failure
(69). Such parameters inevitably introduce non-specificity into
the definition. The call for the need for re-transplantation and
the risk for death are clinician’s calls built on medical facts, the
interpretation of the physician, and a projection based on the
parameters and the experience of the doctor. Since alternatives
are insufficiently well-established, studies relating preservation
quality to PNF need to be read in the light of this limitation.
While PNF is seen as a suitable measure for organ preservation,
other factors impacting on the PNF rate need to be considered.
The fact that re-transplantation is a risk factor for PNF indicates
that the role of recipient factors may be underestimated (70).
Further to this, no clinical preservation trial can seriously build
on PNF as an endpoint, since the PNF rates reported more
recently are in the range of 2–5%. Primary poor function is even
more vague in its sufficiency as a definition and clinical endpoint.
Very recently, Dutkowski et al. (71) critically reflected on the
current parameters used to determine the success of preservation

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
in liver transplantation trials. While the current practice might be
reasonable in the sense that it is building on the combination of
parameters currently best established, alternatives are needed but
need to be more formally established prior to considering them
new clinical standards.
A Brief History
The original vision of organ preservation as formulated in 1813
was built on the continuation of circulation and blood supply
(72). The substitution of blood with perfusion solutions led to
prolonged successful preservation of tissues, as described by
Carrell (73). While prolonged successful preservation of tissues
seems plausible according to these early findings, the actual
suitability for transplantation remained to be established (72).
Successful kidney preservation for 3 to 5 days was achieved by
the use of continuous perfusion with cooled, oxygenated blood
or plasma (74). Since continuous warm perfusion, oxygenation,
and nutrition of an organ during transportation was technically
very demanding, the alternative concept eventually surpassed MP
in the 1960s. The chemical composition of advanced solutions
for hypothermic organ storage resulted in excellent short-term
preservation with good outcomes after transplantation. As with
any achievement, the good results are a blessing and a curse.
With patient and graft survival as the only hard endpoints for
clinical trials, the room for improvement became very small—
at least with standard criteria organs. The search for superior
technologies found a platform for clinical realization only when
the results after transplantation became less convincing, with a
greater effect on bile ducts as a target for early damage in liver
transplantation (72, 75–77). The organ shortage, together with
the push to use lower-quality organs and organs with additional
damage as a result of DCD, triggered the clinical realization of
MP in liver transplantation.
Current Situation
The current status of organ preservation remains largely defined
by SCS. The well-established and standardized procedures of
organ storage in three sterile plastic bags filled with preservation
solution (bag 1) or saline/ringer lactate/other (bags 2/3) is well￾established, with a relatively good understanding of the risk
accumulating with the duration of preservation. The major
advantage of SCS is the safety of the procedure. Pretty much
nothing can happen to an organ in plastic bags, on ice, in
a plastic container. The major limitations of this technique
relate to the fact that metabolism continues—even though
at a very low rate—eventually resulting in the accumulation
of succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (78–81). The
immediate exposure to normothermia and oxygen results in an
inflammatory response and organ-specific damage early after
transplantation. The mechanisms responsible for the eventual
organ damage not only in organ transplantation but also in
other diseases such as cardiac infarction and stroke are well￾established but not are the focus of this review. The key question
in the consideration of NMP as an alternative to SCS is how
effectively the mechanisms leading to an IRI are interrupted
through either immediate NMP or NMP following SCS. While
preclinical evidence (81) and the phase II/III trial by Nasralla et al.
(62) have delivered evidence suggesting that NMP is superior to
SCS when applied immediately, the actual net benefit of NMP
following SCS remains to be more clearly established. While
a key elements in such assessments are the proper definition
of and agreement in the community on suitable endpoints
regarding the preservation quality, the accompanying benefits
and alternative endpoints should not be overlooked. The major
benefit of NMP vs. SCS is the time gained with (as it appears)
a relatively safe prolongation of preservation times under close
to physiological conditions. The ability to monitor the viability
and function of the organ adds important parameters for decision
making and significantly ameliorates the logistical challenges
in transplantation. The benefit of transforming transplantations
into scheduled procedures has the potential to significantly
enhance safety but also training and teaching in transplantation.
Organ Reconditioning
The term organ reconditioning is used in a rather unspecific
manner in our field. According to Wikipedia, reconditioning
means “to restore to a functional state, or to a condition
resembling the original” (search “reconditioning,” September
2019). The way this can be read in reference to human organs
is that no intervention aiming beyond the restoration of the
condition of an organ prior to retrieval (a) or beyond the optimal
(naïve) condition of a healthy human organ (b)—depending
on how the term “original” is interpreted in this context—shall
be included. These two possible views already point toward
very different states of an organ. The way the term was used
in the recent scientific transplant literature is in agreement
with repair of the immediate injury prior to and during organ
retrieval and storage. The key element of reconditioning/repair
as clinically applied at this point relates to the prevention of an
eventual ROS burst by mitochondria and subsequent disruption
of ATP production, mitochondrial permeability transition pores,
and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release upon
reperfusion. An electron shift toward succinate and subsequent
reverse electron transfer upon reperfusion is discussed as a
mechanism of damage and target of therapy in liver HMP (82).
NMP is suggested to mitigate post-reperfusion hyperfibrinolysis
(83) and inflammation (84). While these may be indirect effects
of NMP, the actual immediate therapeutic mechanisms (if any)
may be glycogen repletion and ATP regeneration (85). Whether
these mechanisms are a simple effect of the restoration of close
to physiological conditions or specific for NMP remains to be
established. It is likely, however, that the benefit of NMP is
mostly defined by the replacement or shortening of SCS and the
indirect effects on logistics and preparation, organ monitoring,
and decision making. Further to this, NMP may emerge as a
platform enabling organ treatment, while it may not have a
therapeutic/reconditioning effect per se.
Organ Repair
Human organ repair, apparently, is treated as an equivalent
to organ regeneration (Google search “human organ repair,”
September 2019). While the common understanding of organ
repair might be more mechanistic and that of organ regeneration
more biological, the distinction between the terms seems vague.
Albeit experimental, therapeutic interventions in lungs seem
most closely approaching possible clinical implementation (86).

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
Bronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar
recruitment maneuvers seem to positively affect organ tissue
morphology and organ function. A hurdle to clinical application
may be the legislation. Directive 2004/23/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council “on setting standards of
quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing,
processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human
tissues and cells” largely focusses on tissues and not organs
but represents an important reference. Since preservation times
can be prolonged with the technologies being developed and
urgency may no longer serve as justification for immediate
processing (transplantation) without quality assurance, the legal
framework for tissues and cells could be applied to organs.
The second element of the legal consideration relates to the
element of organ therapy. Inevitably, the issues of responsibilities
and possession require clarification for attempts to introduce
ex vivo human organ treatment into clinical application. As
long as an organ is labeled as discarded because it seems
unsuitable for immediate transplantation, the organ will not
be allocated to an individual, and hence considerations of
possession and responsibilities become less demanding. Once
organs possibly suitable for immediate transplantation have been
treated for reasons such as quality improvement or possibly organ
reconditioning, the allocation process may be completed and the
future recipient indicated. If and how an individual can consent
to interventions and/or a trial involving organs will eventually
require clarification.
Directive 2010/45/EU of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety
of human organs intended for transplantation (https://eur-lex.
europa.eu/eli/dir/2010/53/oj) does not provide much guidance
regarding this issue.
MACHINE PERFUSION IN CLINICAL
PRACTICE
SCS is a simple, safe, and cheap method to preserve and transport
organs, and it has been successfully applied over decades with
good outcomes in SCD organs. However, to date, the large
discrepancy between patients on the waiting lists and available
donor organs has forced the transplant community to cope with
the demand by pushing the limits and expanding the donor
pool by accepting increasing numbers of marginal organs from
ECD and reestablish DCD programs (87). Importantly, ECD and
DCD organs have been identified to be particularly prone to IRI.
Although SCS can decelerate degradation of a preserved organ,
especially in high risk or marginal organs, limited applicability
is the consequence (36, 78). Attempting to overcome this issue,
several MP technologies have been developed and now find their
way into clinical practice in SOT.
HMP of the Liver
Liver HMP has been translated from the experimental state to
clinical reality over the last decade. In 2010, the first phase I
prospective cohort study was published, reporting on 20 patients
who underwent liver transplantation of grafts preserved by non￾oxygenated HMP. Outcomes were compared to a matched SCS
control group. HMP time ranged from 2 to 7 h, with a total
CIT below 12 h. Except for a significantly lower peak serum
AST in the HMP group, no further significant differences were
observed in regard to PNF, early allograft dysfunction, or graft
and patient survival. However, clinical feasibility, as well as non￾inferiority to SCS, was proven, making way for further studies
(88). Five years thereafter, the same group showed promising
results by transplanting 31 ECD livers declined by the United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) region and preserved under
hypothermic dynamic conditions at 4–8◦C. Compared to well￾matched SCS controls, significantly fewer biliary complications
and shorter hospital stays were observed. This study represents a
landmark, since the effectiveness of MP was shown within the
most susceptible livers in the donor pool (89). The impact of
HMP on marginal organs was further investigated by Dutkowski
et al. In an international matched-case analysis, 25 DCD livers
were subjected to HOPE and compared to matched SCS DCD
livers. HOPE resulted in a significant reduction of ischemic
cholangiopathy (HOPE: 20% vs. SCS: 46%) as well as a significant
improvement of 1-year graft survival rates (90 vs. 69%) (58).
The beneficial effect of HMP on DCD grafts was confirmed by a
prospective case-control liver transplantation study, comparing
10 grafts with at least 2 h of DHOPE to 20 grafts without.
An 11-fold increase in cellular ATP during oxygenation was
documented. In addition to good early graft function, both 6-
month and 1-year graft survival were 100%, while 6-month graft
survival and 1-year graft and patient survival in the control group
were 80, 67, and 85%, respectively (57). Moreover, the same
group could demonstrate an attenuation of IRI-associated bile
duct damage after transplantation of DCD end-ischemic DHOPE
liver grafts (90).
HOPE in particular has evolved to become a widely used
technology, showing excellent longer-term results. Schlegel et al.
provided data on 5-year outcomes of patients receiving DCD
livers preserved with 1–2 h of end-ischemic HOPE (n = 50)
and compared them to the equal numbers of DCD liver
transplants without HOPE or DBD liver transplantations. Five￾year outcomes of HOPE-treated DCD liver transplants were
similar to those of DBD primary transplants and superior to those
of untreated DCD liver transplants (HOPE DCD 94% vs. SCS
DCD 78%) (91).
NMP of the Liver
Preserving an organ under physiological conditions is the ideal
condition to prevent deleterious effects of ischemia as well as
IRI following SOT. Similar to HMP, NMP has recently been
implemented in clinical routine at a variety of centers. The
transfer from the experimental stage to clinical application
was first described by Ravikumar et al. in 2016. In this phase
1 (first-in-man), non-randomized prospective trial, short-term
outcomes of 20 recipients of NMP-perfused donor livers were
matched in a ratio of 1:2 to cold-stored livers. In the study group,
livers were preserved under normothermic conditions over the
entire preservation period (ranging from 3.5 to 18.5 h). Except for
a significantly reduced peak serum AST in NMP-liver recipients,
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
no differences regarding short-term recipient survival, PNF rate,
or early allograft dysfunction were observed. Therefore, the safety
and feasibility of this dynamic preservation method could be
confirmed, opening the field for further clinical investigations
with major implications on logistics (66).
Feasibility and reproducibility following transplantation were
further underlined in a U.S. phase I non-randomized pilot study
(92). However, this trial also pointed out that NMP of an organ
is not a trivial procedure and runs the risk of graft loss if
human/technical errors occur. Out of 10 procured livers, one
organ had to be promptly discarded due to an unrecognized
portal vein twist. The remaining nine organs (four DCD
Maastricht class III, 5 DBD) were successfully transplanted, and
outcomes were comparable to matched control liver transplant
recipients of SCS grafts. The proof of concept and feasibility gave
way for larger-scale trials.
Nasralla et al. were first to perform RCT to test the efficacy
of NMP vs. SCS. After informed consent had been obtained
from the recipient, the allocated liver was either randomized to
SCS or NMP. NMP was performed over the entire preservation
period. Outcomes of 121 NMP-graft recipients were compared to
outcomes from 101 well-matched SCS-graft recipients. The key
findings of this study were a significantly reduced peak serum
AST, a significant reduction of post-reperfusion syndrome, and
a 72% lower adjusted odds rate of developing early allograft
dysfunction (EAD) in the NMP liver recipients compared to
controls. Furthermore, NMP of the liver graft resulted in
increased organ utilization with a 50% lower discard rate in this
group (62).
The additional positive effect of NMP is the “almost”
physiological aspect of this method, which opens up new
possibilities by means of organ assessment and organ selection.
This fact was a matter of investigation in an observational
study, where livers considered unsuitable for transplantation
as well as highest risk liver were included. In total, 47 livers
were biochemically assessed during the preservation, resulting
in 39 liver transplants. Remarkably, two out of 19 livers deemed
unsuitable were transplanted (93).
In summary, both HMP/HOPE and NMP are accepted
and clinically established preservation methods, particularly
interesting in the preservation and preconditioning of high-risk
organs. Especially in this organ category, including ECD and
DCD livers, they have both been shown to be superior to SCS.
Whether HMP/HOPE or HMP is superior to the other is still a
matter of debate since the two methods have not been correlated
with each other in clinical settings, and further RCTs are needed.
HMP of the Kidney
The amount of clinical evidence for dynamic preservation of
kidney grafts is rapidly increasing. Moers et al. were first to
perform an international RCT on hypothermically perfused
kidneys for transplantation. One kidney from 336 deceased
donors was randomly assigned to HMP, and the other to SCS. A
reduced risk of DGF and improved graft survival in favor of MP￾preserved organs was shown (47). These promising results were
confirmed in a subsequent RCT from the Eurotransplant region.
Jochmans et al. investigated the efficacy of HMP in preserving
DCD kidneys. Similar to Moers et al., DCD kidneys were assigned
in a 1:1 match to HMP or SCS, resulting in a total of 164 kidney
transplants (82 HMP vs. 82 SCS). HMP resulted in a significantly
reduced DGF rate as well as better early graft function after
1 month compared to SCS. However, 1-year graft survival was
comparable in both groups (49).
Furthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved
by HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as
Jochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.
Secondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft
survival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non￾function were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.
One-year graft survival and function could be improved by
dynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,
the importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT
and the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.
CIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order
to investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from
HMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively
collected data from the “Machine Perfusion Trial.” A total of 752
renal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved
kidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT
as an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did
not prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).
The optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,
HMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a
primary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as
a reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster
recovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior
to transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was
at least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors
under the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).
Further studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in
the end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as
well as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is
attributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).
NMP of the Kidney
NMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues
related to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of
preserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions
with the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to
transplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number
of preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded
human kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of
the kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.
were first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality
by transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old
recipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a
plasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9◦C for 35 min prior
to transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,
the patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level
of 132 µmol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the
recipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on
this first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical
reality on a larger scale. Eighteen ECD kidneys were subjected to
NMP reconditioning prior to transplantation. The average NMP
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
time was prolonged to 63 min. Outcomes were compared to 47
matched ECD kidneys preserved by SCS. In this study, NMP
resulted in a significantly reduced DGF rate compared to controls
(NMP: 5.6% vs. SCS: 36.2%). However, no differences could be
observed in regard to 1-year graft or patient survival (97).
Taken together, HMP of the kidney has been shown to have its
place, especially in the preservation of marginal grafts, including
grafts from DCD and ECD, with superior outcomes in the early
phase compared to SCS. However, CIT is still the limiting factor
influencing short- as well as long-term outcomes. In contrast,
although the amount of preclinical data is rapidly increasing,
NMP is still in its early phase. However, feasibility and non￾inferiority to SCS have been described at this early stage, and
multicenter RCTs are planned.
Machine Preservation of the Pancreas
In contrast to the dynamic preservation of liver and kidney,
pancreatic MP is challenging. This is attributed to the physiologic
as well as the anatomical characteristics of the pancreatic graft
(98). MP of pancreatic grafts poses major challenges due to the
susceptibility of the organ to IRI-associated alterations, including
acinar necrosis, edema formation, and endothelial disruption.
These factors in particular are recognized risk factors for early
graft pancreatitis and thrombosis, eventually resulting in graft
loss (98, 99).
In contrast to the liver as well as the kidney, the
pancreas is characterized by a low-flow and low-pressure
environment, which impedes the direct translation of the existing
perfusion machines for use in dynamic pancreas preservation
(100). However, the feasibility of pancreatic HMP has been
demonstrated in several experimental settings involving the
preservation of porcine, dog, and discarded human pancreas
grafts (55, 101, 102). Although results are promising in this
experimental setting, clinical translation is still pending.
Therefore, assessment and evaluation of a pancreatic graft
prior to transplantation would be of the utmost importance,
since changes in donor demographics result in an increased
need for the acceptance of higher-risk grafts at high-volume
centers. However, MP of pancreatic grafts must still be considered
experimental at this stage.
Machine Preservation of the Lung
Due to pre- and peri-retrieval management and direct
examination of the donor organ by the explant surgeon, some
extended criteria organs can be directly used with acceptable risk
for the recipient, but a notable number are rejected during the
retrieval process. There is still a lack of clear decision criteria
for lung suitability for transplantation or attempts at lung
reconditioning using an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) (103).
Needless to say, MP could improve organ availability, which is
critically needed in the face of a waitlist mortality that is reported
to be up to 30% depending on the allocation system (104).
Importantly, ex vivo prolonged lung preservation resulted in
successful transplantation of high-risk donor lungs (105), and
MP is now indispensable for evaluating lung graft quality from
an uncontrolled DCD (106). Very promising data have come
from experimental EVLP studies, which are outlined later in
this article.
Machine Preservation of the Heart
At present, SCS of donor hearts remains the standard practice
in most transplant units, whereas MP is limited to a few centers
in the US and Europe. To date, only one device is available for
clinical use—the Transmedic Organ Care System (OCS) Heart.
At mild hypothermia (34◦C), the system uses a combination of
donor blood and a proprietary solution as perfusate for the heart.
In 2014, heart NMP has led to the first distant procurement DCD
heart transplantation. To date, over 100 DCD heart transplants
have been performed using a cardiac perfusion system (107), and
MP of hearts exhibited safe preservation in RCTs (108).
EX VIVO MONITORING OF ORGAN
FUNCTION AND QUALITY
Currently, the decision as to whether organs are suitable for
transplantation is determined on the basis of more or less
subjective empirically established clinical parameters that have
been shown to be associated with an increased rate of early
allograft dysfunction or graft failure. Parameters such as donor
past medical history, last known laboratory values, findings
during procurement, and other procurement variables such as
expected ischemia times primarily determine the acceptability
of a graft. These parameters include prolonged warm ischemia
time (WIT) >30 min during DCD, prolonged CIT, and
parenchymal alterations within the graft (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis,
arteriosclerosis). Viability testing and functional assessment
prior to transplantation are likely to extend the utilization of
suboptimal or marginal organs (109–111).
HMP is an alternative method to standard SCS for the
preservation of organs. For different types of kidney grafts, HMP
offers superior preservation compared with SCS. In terms of graft
quality assessment during HMP, some biochemical parameters of
the released perfusate and hydrodynamic parameters are found
to independently correlate with the outcome—a finding that may
help clinicians in their decision making.
Increased Glutathione S-Tranferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D￾glucosaminidase (NAG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein
(H-FABP), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations
during MP may serve as indicators for suboptimal graft quality.
Furthermore, levels of redox-active iron measured in the
perfusate have been correlated with DGF rates (112–114).
Moreover, the measurement of vascular resistance during MP
represents an additional and objective source of information
that can assist clinicians in their decision-making process.
High vascular resistance as a hydrodynamic parameter has
been shown to be associated with an increased risk of DGF
development and predictive for 1-year graft failure (115–117).
Taken together, to date, increased vascular resistance and high
injury marker concentrations in the perfusate are risk factors for
DGF and helpful parameters, but they are not accurate enough
to justify a decision for discard based on their interpretation
alone (112–114, 117).
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
Concerning kidney NMP, a scoring system has been
developed by Hosgood and Nicholson. The decision on whether
to transplant an NMP-kidney was based on macroscopic
appearance, renal blood flow, and total urine output during
NMP. The authors conclude that, currently, a high percentage of
retrieved kidneys are being unnecessarily discarded (80, 118).
Compared to the kidney, data on liver monitoring during
HMP remain scarce, although recent publications suggest
promising parameters. A correlation between the AST levels
in the perfusate during HMP and the peak of AST after liver
transplantation has been described. Furthermore, during HMP
of porcine livers, a cumulative release of Fatty Acid- Binding
Protein 1 (FABP) or AST may be represented by a linear or
logarithmic equation, respectively. Each equation is characterized
by a b-coefficient that is able to discriminate between livers likely
to fail. Similarly, during HMP of human livers discarded for
transplantation, AST release in the perfusate could discriminate
between livers suitable for transplantation and unsuitable ones.
More sophisticated methods to determine graft viability include
evaluation of ATP content assessed by magnetic resonance
imaging and spectroscopy (89, 91, 119–121). In this regard, van
Rijn et al. used cellular ATP content during oxygenated dual
(arterial and portal perfusion) HMP as a viability marker for liver
grafts. Cellular ATP content correlated with biochemical function
early after transplantation (57).
Furthermore, there is evidence that a decline in arterial flow
in a pressure-controlled system of MP can be used as a marker
for decreasing graft viability. However, in general, it cannot be
advised to use flow values as an indicator of liver damage and
viability during human liver MP (61, 91, 122).
Concerning NMP of liver grafts, this technology has been
applied with promising results for utilization and outcomes
(62, 66, 92, 123–126), and the option for the assessment of
liver viability during NMP has been highlighted. Imber et al.
(127) suggested that bile production is directly associated with
liver viability. Matton et al. (128) were able to show that a
biliary bicarbonate concentration greater than 18 mmol/L has a
high negative predictive value in terms of histological bile duct
injury. Moreover, biliary pH greater than 7.48, biliary glucose
concentration less than 16 mmol/L, bile/perfusate glucose
concentration ratio less than 0.67, and biliary LDH concentration
less than 3,689 U/L may serve as indicators for high biliary
viability. Watson et al. (93) published their experience of
transplanting declined livers following NMP and graft viability
assessment. They observed that NMP resulted in a reduced
incidence of post-reperfusion syndrome and described biliary
pH as a predictive marker for post-transplant cholangiopathy.
Perfusate lactate and transaminases and bile production during
NMP were suggested by Op den Dries et al. (129) to serve
as viability markers. Recently, Mergental et al. (130) published
viability criteria (applicable within 3 h of perfusion) for livers
considered suitable for transplantation. These include lactate
clearance, bile production, PH- homeostasis, and stable pressure
and flow dynamics of the graft.
There is growing evidence that hepatic ATP content may serve
as a viability marker. In clinical studies, hepatic ATP levels prior
to organ retrieval or during preservation correlated with primary
liver function after transplantation. Bruisma et al. showed
that differences in mitochondrial respiration and restoration of
cellular ATP contents are possible viability markers in the setting
of NMP. Moreover, NMP offers the option to perform dynamic
metabolomic analyses in both bile samples and sequential liver
biopsies (111, 131).
However, although these results seem impressive, none of the
above-mentioned viability markers have been validated in larger
studies, and the small numbers of patients included in the studies
make it difficult to draw robust conclusions.
Regarding a potential viability assessment of human pancreas
grafts during HMP, flow indices and histological assessment
of duodenal and pancreas-parenchyma biopsies throughout the
perfusion duration have been proposed. Branchereau et al.
described an absence of edema, a decrease in resistance indices,
and normal staining for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin as
markers for good graft quality (56, 101). Barlow et al. suggested
the assessment of amylase levels in the perfusate, fat infiltration
(detected using standard histology), and exocrine pancreas
function as criteria to assess graft viability during NMP (55).
Concerning heart transplantation, organ assessment during
NMP mainly relies on metabolic parameters and measurements
of lactate levels in the aortic root and pulmonary artery. In the
PROCEED II trial, three hearts were discarded due to rising total
perfusate lactate concentrations. Histopathological examination
showed myocardial injury (necrosis, hemorrhage, scarring) or
left ventricular hypertrophy in those organs (108). Calculations
of pressure volume loops in the left and right ventricle
have been described by switching the heart into a “working
mode” during NMP. Based on pressure-volume (PV) loop data,
end-systolic elastance could be calculated as a parameter for
ventricular contractility (44, 132). Due to complicated clinical
interpretation and difficulties in reproducibility, “working mode”
has been removed from the OCS perfusion module. Contrast
echocardiography or intravascular ultrasound of coronary
arteries might emerge as tools for anatomical and mechanical
assessment during NMP but have not been implemented in
clinical routine so far.
In EVLP, assessment of the organ relies primarily on
functional and macroscopic parameters, as has been reviewed
recently (103). Adequate gas exchange, stable hemodynamic
and ventilatory parameters, macroscopic evaluation (absence
of oedema), bronchoscopy (absence of purulent secretion and
erythema of the bronchus), and deflation after endotracheal
tube disconnection (collapse test) during the evaluation period
are the commonly used decision criteria for acceptance of the
lung. Yet these criteria are not standardized and differ between
transplant centers (103). As physiological parameters are in
the lead for decision making in EVLP, clinical single-center
studies assessed different biomarkers and metabolic parameters
of the perfusate or the bronchioalveolar lavage to predict organ
acceptance and occurrence of early prostaglandin D3 (PGD3).
Machuca et al. (133) showed that high levels of endothelin-1 (ET￾1) and Big ET-1 measured in perfusate samples have prognostic
value for decline in the lung because of subsequent development
of poor physiological performance. Subsequently, the same group
suggested IL-8 as a powerful predictor for early graft dysfunction

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
(134). Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-8 levels measured in the
perfusate during EVLP were reported to inversely correlate with
the recipient oxygenation 24 h post-transplantation (135).
Interestingly, given the observation that perfusate IL-1β and
TNF-α at 30 min during EVLP were effective markers for
differentiating between in-hospital survival and non-survival
post-transplant, blocking the IL-1β pathway during EVLP
might reduce endothelial activation and subsequent neutrophil
adhesion on reperfusion (136).
IMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF
(MARGINAL) ORGANS DURING MACHINE
PERFUSION
The definition of marginal organs per se is a rather arbitrary one.
The most commonly used is the dichotomy between standard
criteria (SCD) and extended criteria donors (ECD), which is
simply discriminated by age and three donor criteria for the DBD
(and, increasingly, DCD) kidney cohort (13, 137, 138). However,
in clinical routine, it is not always straightforward to decide if an
organ is within “standard criteria,” as there are plethora of factors
interfering with organ quality, i.e., estimated duration of CIT,
(functional) WIT, or the grade of steatosis in liver and pancreas,
just to mention a few.
When we focus on the donor age only, a vast amount of
literature exists. There is evidence that the immunogenicity
of elderly organs is increased, as it is believed that aging in
combination with injuries (i.e., brain death) induces a pro￾inflammatory environment, which could lead to an activation
of innate and adaptive immune responses (139–141). Aging
influences cellular repair mechanisms, and it is known that
the number of MHC molecules present on the cellular
surface is increased by aged parenchymal cells (139). In
experimental studies, transplantation of elderly organs was
associated with a more powerful early immune response
compared to transplantation of younger ones. Recipients of
such old grafts presented with a higher concentration of
effector/memory T-cells with an increased alloreactivity, leading
to acute rejection, which results in a particular high burden
of damage for the older donor organ (140). Elderly organs do
not have the same repair mechanism capabilities, so the clinical
damage of acute rejection leaves a more severe defect, explaining
the increased rates of DGF and/or graft loss in this donor
cohort (140, 142).
An alteration of immunogenicity in aging organs could be
one reason to focus on preservation techniques (143) such
as HMP and NMP to learn more about the process or even
to (re-)condition an organ for reperfusion in the recipient.
Due to the fact that the reconstitution of a near-physiological
environment might work best to study immune cells, the
following paragraphs will bring NMP into focus.
Human organs are equipped with a sophisticated resident
immune system. The kidney, for example, not only hosts tissue￾resident macrophages (144); the organ also harbors lymphocytes,
innate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T
(NKT) cells, and γδ T cells (145). The residential immune cells
of human organs remain in a balanced homeostatic state unless
they are stimulated—by the insult of brain death in an organ
donor, for example—when an immunological activation might be
induced. Such a response to a significant injury like brain death in
an organ donor includes both local and systemic inflammation,
comprising cellular infiltrates and a cytokine storm (146).
With the current gold-standard preservation technologies such
as SCS, the organs will be transplanted unchanged, in an
immunologically activated status, into recipients in whom
alloantigens will trigger another immune response immediately
after reperfusion, presented by donor-derived antigen presenting
cells to recipient T cells (147, 148). How important donor￾derived leukocytes are in the allorecognition and rejection
processes was demonstrated by Lechler and Batchelor years
ago. They impressively showed that placing a rat kidney into
an intermediate recipient before implanting it into the final
recipient could significantly prolong allograft survival. These
experiments demonstrated that “clearing” the organ of dendritic
cells (DC), the “passenger leukocytes” responsible for activating
recipient T cells, by using the intermediate rat led to the desired
success (149, 150). “Parking” the organ in an interim host
is not a feasible strategy for implementation in the clinical
routine. However, NMP offers the possibility to represent the
intermediate recipient as a conditioning tool to achieve the same
end result, as previously published by Lechler et al. (150). An
ex vivo setting might provide not only a more physiological
preservation method but also the ability to assess the organ
prior to transplantation and to investigate its immunological
characteristics in isolation (42).
One of the leading groups analyzing marginal and SCD
organs after ex vivo perfusion is the Manchester group around
Fildes and Stone. Already in 2015, they compared the clinical
outcome of patients transplanted with marginal donor lungs
after undergoing EVLP compared to standard transplantation
of acceptable lungs (151). Despite having transplanted marginal
lungs, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome
up to 12 months after transplantation concerning the overall
incidence of acute rejection and the number of treated infection
episodes (151). This work was followed by a study on passenger
leukocyte migration from donor lungs into the recipients and
the effects of donor leukocyte depletion prior to transplantation
using EVLP (152). In this experimental work using a porcine
model, Stone et al. illustrated that donor leukocyte transfer
into the recipient was reduced by EVLP and therefore reduces
direct allorecognition and T-cell priming (152). The same group
transferred their experience to an ex vivo NMP model to analyze
donor-derived leukocytes in a porcine renal transplantation
model. Stone et al. were able to demonstrate that an inflammatory
cytokine storm and the release of mitochondrial and genomic
DNA were initiated in the NMP circuit prior to transplantation.
However, the renal function was not impacted at all after
transplanting those organs. They suggest that NMP could be used
to immunodeplete and to saturate the capacity of inflammation
of donor kidneys before transplanting them (152). Amin et al.
(153) evaluated the impact of a post-SCS-preservation flush on
the inflammatory burden of a limb allograft (a porcine model for
vascularized composite allotransplantation). The venous effluent

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
after flushing the limbs following either 2 or 6 h of SCS comprised
a large population of viable leukocytes, significant concentrations
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA. These
results support the hypothesis that flushing or dynamically
preserving the organs prior to transplantation impacts the
inflammatory burden otherwise transferred to the recipient upon
reperfusion unchanged (153).
Liver NMP has recently been implemented as a standard
procedure in the United Kingdom and been shown to improve
organ utilization and post-transplant outcomes following phase I
and phase III prospective randomized trials (62, 66). Jassem et al.
(84) transplanted, compared, and analyzed 12 NMP-preserved
livers against 27 SCS-preserved livers to assess the impact of NMP
on IRI, necrosis, platelet deposition, neutrophil infiltration, and
the degree of steatosis after NMP or SCS pre- and post-perfusion.
Their results showed that, with NMP, there were altered gene￾expression profiles of liver tissue from pro-inflammation to
regeneration, reduced numbers of interferon gamma (IFNγ)-
and interleukin-17-producing T cells, and an enlarged pool
of regulatory T cells. In addition, NMP liver tissue was less
necrotic and apoptotic compared to SCS-preserved livers, with
less neutrophils infiltrating the periportal area (84).
Overall, with the clinical and experimental evidence gained
so far for the field of SOT, dynamic preservation methods -
and NMP in particular - provide the means to introduce
organ conditioning so as to lower immunogenicity as well as
pro-inflammatory markers while ensuring the promotion of
graft regeneration.
IMMUNOMODULATION DURING MP
Machine perfusion (MP) offers a previously non-existent link
between basic and clinical science. The opportunity to treat an
organ during preservation creates a new field of translational
research. In this context, one of the main targets that can now
be addressed is the modulation of the immunogenicity of a
specific graft. In theory, such immunomodulation could allow the
obviation of lifelong immunosuppression or even forge a path to
the holy grail in transplantation—the achievement of tolerance.
Importantly, MP offers a platform to apply immunomodulatory
strategies that have been elucidated in in vitro or preclinical
models in the past.
In the existing literature, three major such strategies have
been investigated, which are discussed herein. One of the
most promising is the application of stem or progenitor
cells, with the potential to suppress immunogenicity and help
repair injured tissue. Another strategy is the administration of
anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory drugs and agents, and,
finally, gene transduction by adenoviral vector gene delivery.
The majority of studies have been carried out under
normothermic conditions. However, oxygenated perfusion of
a graft per se seems not only to protect against preservation
injury but also to downregulate the immune system and
blunt the alloimmune response, as was shown in a rodent
model of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) (154). In
particular, the constant flow of fluids in the vessels during MP is
regarded to promote the expression of vasoprotective endothelial
genes, alleviating the microcirculatory failure associated with
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) (155–157). On the other
hand, when it comes to additional modification, it is perfusion
under normothermic conditions that seems to represent the
ideal platform, since NMP grants a physiological metabolic
state (81, 158–160).
Many of the ongoing studies addressing the field of
immunomodulation during MP are carried out in a porcine
setting, as pigs have appropriate size and anatomy as well
as immunologic characteristics (161). Whereas, much of our
knowledge on organ preservation is derived from various animal
studies (162), the porcine model above all has now evolved
as an ideal model, making ex vivo porcine organ perfusion
models a suitable platform for translational transplant research.
According to a recent review, in 2017, 22 articles discussed ex
vivo porcine organ perfusion within the context of transplant
preservation surgery (162), but the number of articles has steadily
increased since then. However, also in this setting, it is important
to highlight potential limitations when translating experiences
between species (158).
Stem and Progenitor Cells
Several candidate cells have been investigated, including stromal
mesenchymal cells (MSCs), induced adult pluripotent stem cells,
fetal stem cells from placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid, and
umbilical cord, and hematopoietic cells (163). Among these,
MSCs have been reported to represent the most promising cell
subset. MSCs are multipotent cells that are found in adult tissues,
including adipose tissue and bone marrow, where they support
function and repair. Importantly, they have been shown to abate
immune and inflammatory responses via the release of paracrine
effectors (164, 165).
This circumstance has led to a broad application of MSCs in
a variety of pathologies. Therefore, a prerequisite for research
on MSCs is the agreement on criteria that define these cells and
allow comparability between studies. The International Society
for Cellular Therapy has established the minimum criteria that
a cell must meet to be considered an MSC: first, an MSC
must be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture
conditions; second, an MSC must express CD105, CD73, and
CD90 and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b,
CD79alpha or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules; third, an
MSC must differentiate into cell types of mesodermal origin in
vitro (166, 167).
The fact that MSCs are known for their potent anti￾inflammatory and regenerative capacities, combined with the
finding that a therapeutic effect can be achieved with either
autologous or allogeneic MSCs (168), has led to the conduction of
several studies investigating whether their application is feasible
in the context of MP. However, the detailed mechanisms by
which MSCs exert their anti-inflammatory and regenerative
potential have not yet been depicted. The main mechanism of
action is supposed to rely on secreted mediators. Therefore, an
appropriate timeframe is likely to be required for these cells
in order to mediate beneficial effects (169). This hypothesis is
underlined by the findings of a recent study in a porcine ex
vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model. Twelve-hour NMP of DCD
lungs with intravascular delivery of MSCs (150 × 106
) resulted
in reduced levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
cytokine associated with reperfusion injury, along with increased
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (170). The
fact that IL-8 was suppressed is of particular note, since MSCs are
known to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which
in turn has been reported to significantly suppress the production
of IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner (169).
In human kidneys, Brasile et al. demonstrated actual
renal regeneration mediated by MSCs under 24 h of ex vivo
normothermic perfusion. The authors used an exsanguinous
metabolic support (EMS) tissue-engineering platform to study
five pairs of kidney allografts from DCD donors. Whereas, one
kidney of each pair solely underwent perfusion, the partner
kidney was EMS perfused with MSC (1 × 10). Indeed, a reduced
inflammatory response was observed along with increased
synthesis of adenosine triphosphate and growth factors and a
normalization of the cytoskeleton and mitosis (171).
Even though these findings are promising, more insight
needs to be gained regarding the effects of the NMP milieu
on MSC themselves and the comparability between human
and porcine data. These aspects were highlighted in a kidney
NMP model, showing that while the suspension conditions
reduced the viability of porcine MSC by 40% in both perfusion
fluid and culture medium, the viability of human MSC was
reduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid,
and no differences were found in survival in culture medium.
Furthermore, it was shown that a freeze-thawing process
impaired survival, metabolism, and the ability to adhere to
endothelial cells. The authors concluded that NMP conditions
affect MSC but show sufficient support of their function and
survival that MSC administration through NMP should be
considered, and secondly that slight differences in the behavior
of porcine and human MSC need to be taken into account (158).
Another recent analysis focused on the characteristics of
culture-expanded MSC, investigating heir viability and homin
during NMP. Kidneys were perfused for 7 h in the presence
of 105
, 106
, or 107 human adipose tissue-derived MSC. Intact
MSCs were detected in the lumen of glomerular capillaries,
but only in the 107 MSC group. After a rapid decline of cell
numbers during NMP, only a small portion of the MSCs were
intact, and these were clustered in a minority of glomeruli. Apart
from outlining the complexity of MSC therapy during MP, the
authors concluded that “an exciting new window of opportunity
might emerge to actively pre-condition isolated organs in a fully
controlled setting and in the absence of an immune response, before
they are transplanted” (172).
It is noteworthy that such promising findings have recently
led to the creation of the international “MePEP consortium”
(173) in order to study this novel modality of treatment in
preparation for human trials. Therefore, more findings on MSC
and immunomodulation can be expected in the near future.
Anti-inflammatory Agents
Alternatively, pharmacologic interventions to decrease
immunogenicity or prevent recurrent disease can be applied
during MP. The seemingly most obvious strategy to influence the
inflammatory profile is the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents
directly into the machine perfusion circuit, treating the liver
ex vivo during the preservation period to obviate the need for
lifelong immunosuppression or to improve long-term outcomes
separate from the physiological quality of the organ at the time
of transplantation (174).
Several targets for potential agents have been identified.
Amongst these is TNF-alpha, one of the most potent
proinflammatory cytokines, which is released in response
to and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IRI (175, 176).
Therefore, in a recent clinical HMP study, it was hypothesized
that the administration of the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept
could improve outcomes following kidney transplantation.
However, no significant differences were found concerning
kidney machine perfusion parameters, including average flow
and vascular resistance, nor did the authors observe significant
changes regarding DGF, rejection episodes, or allograft survival
(177). However, it has to be taken in mind that this study was
carried out under hypothermic conditions. Although possible in
other machine-perfusion techniques, NMP seems to be ideal, as
active metabolism permits graft intervention and modification
during preservation, circumstances that are not present in
HMP (178).
More promising data come from a porcine study in
which a variety of agents were added to act at different
levels. Prostaglandin E1, a prostacyclin analog with vasodilator,
antiplatelet, fibrinolytic, and several other anti-inflammatory
properties, was continuously administered. In addition, n￾acetylcysteine was added due to its free radical scavenging
properties. Sevoflurane was administered due to its protective
properties on endothelial cells, and carbon monoxide was
added with the objective of improving vasodilatation and
reducing inflammation. Indeed, during a 3-day follow-up after
transplantation, this treatment resulted in lower AST levels as
well as lower levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α),
and galactosidase and increased IL-10 levels (179).
Other candidate markers for modulation during MP are anti￾inflammatory receptors. In this context, the adenosine A2A
receptor downregulates inflammation, including the suppression
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increases endothelial cell
nitric oxide (174). Since experiences in rabbit experiments
showed that adenosine A2A receptor activation can diminish
IRI (180), a subsequent study evaluated whether treatment with
an adenosine A2A receptor agonist could be beneficial during
normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Indeed, EVLP
with targeted A2AR agonist treatment could attenuate IRI after
transplantation of DCD donor lungs subjected to prolonged 12-h
cold preservation in a preclinical porcine model (181).
Adenoviral Vector Gene Delivery
As cellular metabolism is preserved during normothermic
perfusion, it represents a potential platform for effective gene
transduction in a specific graft (182). To test this hypothesis
in donor lungs, Yeung et al. used a porcine model of
EVLP and treated them with an E1-, E3-deleted adenoviral
vector encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the
immunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10). They observed a
decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1,
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 14 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as attenuation of the alloimmune
response following transplantation (174, 182).
This finding is also of particular interest, since the delivery
of adenoviral vectors could result in a prompt innate immune
response by macrophages, recruiting circulating neutrophils,
which in turn propagate the inflammatory response. Moreover,
in the transplant setting, this preexisting inflammation could
potentiate subsequent IRI (182, 183). Therefore, the authors
compared in vivo and ex vivo administration and showed that
donor lung is superior to in vivo delivery since it leads to less
vector-associated inflammation (182).
Concerning the kidney, already in 2002, proof of principle of
a similar technique had been reported by Brasile et al., using a
recombinant adenovirus, Ad5, CMV5 GFP encoded with green
fluorescence protein. They achieved effective transfection and
synthesis during 24 h of ex vivo normothermic perfusion (184).
Only recently has a normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion
delivery method for cardiac transplantation gene therapy been
reported. Adenoviral vector transduction was utilized to deliver
particles of an Adenoviral firefly luciferase vector with a
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to porcine donor hearts
during NMP and prior to heterotopic implantation. Along with
a high copy number of vector genomic DNA in transplanted
hearts, there was no evidence of vector DNA in either the
recipient’s native heart or liver, substantiating the applicability
and safety of the protocol.
These findings make it likely that this technology could be
feasible for other organ systems as well. A wide variety of
interesting genes could be targeted. As has been reviewed lately
(159), promising possibilities arise when translating the findings
of rodent models using adenoviruses expressing CTLA4Ig (185)
to the setting of NMP; also, NMP could be used to deliver
gene therapies that induce cytoprotection against IRI, such as
myr-Akt (159, 186).
Outstandingly, Figueiredo et al. recently showed that antigen
silencing is feasible during NMP. In a porcine model of
lung NMP, short hairpin RNAs were delivered by lentiviral
vectors, successfully reducing the immunogenicity of the
lung by silencing MHC expression on the endothelium.
The authors concluded that the decrease in immunogenicity
carries the potential to generate immunologically invisible
organs to counteract the burden of rejection and
immunosuppression (187).
Organ Reconditioning and Repair
Recent experimental data primarily focusing on marginal livers
furthermore suggested that NMP offers a platform for organ
reconditioning and repair.
Impressive data from Birmingham, UK, showed that livers
discarded due to pronounced steatosis could be effectively treated
with defatting agents during 6 h of NMP. Tissue triglycerides
were lowered by 38% and macrovesicular steatosis by 40%, which
was associated with a down-regulation of inflammatory marker
expression relevant for oxidative injury and activation of immune
cells (CD14; CD11b), combined with reduced inflammatory
cytokines in the perfusate (TNFα, IL-1β) (188). In addition,
arterial vasospasm can be modulated by the application of ET-1
antagonists, prostacyclin analog, or calcium channel antagonists
during NMP (189). Furthermore, NMP can be used for the
direct and efficient application of antiviral agents, as shown in
a porcine NMP model, in which Miravirsen, an inhibitor of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, produced improved uptake
compared to SCS control livers. The authors concluded that
this approach might offer a future strategy to prevent HCV
reinfection after liver transplantation (190). Likewise, HCV￾infected human donor lungs could effectively be treated during
short-time EVLP via physical viral clearance combined with
germicidal light-based therapies (191).
In summary, immunomodulation in the context of MP seems
to offer a plethora of novel strategies. A series of porcine
and human studies distinctively underline its effectiveness and
feasibility. However, as formulated in a recent review (191, 192),
the studies conducted so far just scratch the surface of conceivable
interventions. In particular, NMP provides an ideal platform
for immunomodulatory modifications. The next step will be the
translation of findings from preclinical and rodent models as well
as HMP trials into the setting of NMP.
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN THE
TRANSPLANTATION OF MARGINAL
ORGANS
Much speculation about the changes in transplantation is
currently energizing the field. The conceptual approach of
extracorporal organ preservation and monitoring begs for
speculation about organ reconditioning, repair, and treatment.
While these are all valid considerations and perfectly reasonable
hopes, the implementation of machine perfusion is the first
step. Immediate and widespread adoption of HMP and NMP is
unlikely since this technology does not immediately improve the
outcome with regard to the primary endpoints in transplantation:
patient and graft survival. Authority approval and market entry
are largely based on secondary endpoints such as delayed
graft function (DGF, kidney) or primary poor function (PPF,
liver), which are considered to serve as surrogates for improved
long-term results. The conceptual limitation with surrogates is,
however, that the predictive value is not uniformly robust or
formally established and immediately reproducible. The DGF
rate, for example, in kidneys from DCD donors is high, but
the predictive value of DFG in these cases is low (193). The
definition of PPF is mostly based on high AST/ALT values early
after transplantation. While these parameters indicate hepatocyte
damage, correlation with the eventual outcome is very limited
(194). Hence, the adoption of the technology is possibly built
on the wish for innovation and the belief in the value of the
time gain with NMP. Preliminary data on HOPE in recent and
ongoing trials indicate a possible benefit in organ survival. If such
an outcome is eventually formally achieved, the arguments for
implementation will be more substantial.
For clinical implementation, several regional and center
factors play an important role. First, the retrieval team
may be different from the team eventually performing the
transplantation. Even if the retrieval team is familiar with the
technology, the preparation of the graft prior to NMP (more
than HMP) is more substantial and more definitive for the
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631

Resch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs
fate of the graft. Hence, in a system with longer-distance organ
exchange, additional steps and a new routine would need to be
established. The technology and the shifting of the work of the
backtable procedure to the retrieving team need to be considered.
The alternative approach where the organ is transferred to
the recipient center and is then machine perfused is currently
being pursued, but data indicating the actual advantage of this
approach are lacking (195). For now, NMP serves as a technology
that allows one important asset in surgery to be gained: time.
The value of time and flexibility is dependent on the regional
circumstances but may hold great potential for easing the surgery
logistics, working hours, and surgical training but also gives rise
to higher risks of nighttime procedures. The actual value of time
in this context, however, requires further attention and needs to
be better defined.
The consideration of longer-term organ preservation under
normothermic conditions further carries the challenge of
defining the responsibilities for managing and monitoring the
organs. Eventually, the working place description of health
care workers involved in this will require adoption and formal
training. Standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety
parameters need to be established for a wider spread use of
the technology. It is likely that the advanced technological
requirements and the need for 24-h availability of knowhow and
personnel would favor the establishment of regional hubs for MP.
Despite the hype in the field, the clinical adoption of MP is
slow. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the lack of
reimbursement is a stringent limitation in many regions. For the
technology to be reimbursed, the authorities will require hard
facts. Hence, the path to more widespread clinical use might
be long, and the focus should remain on the demonstration of
superiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints.
One major important step toward collective advancement in
this field would be the definition of data points during and
after MP and the establishment of registries for coordinated
data collection. Such data points should include the definition
and terminology of the various time points and actions such as
cold flush and storage prior to MP, temperature and flow during
MP, parameters indicating metabolic function and bile/urine
production during MP, second flush, second cold ischemia time,
and others. One of the hurdles in improving NMP is the
large number of variables added to preservation. Identifying
the relevance of individual parameters will require attention
to the details of the procedure and adequate data collection
and handling. To the knowledge of the authors, no routine
data collection and no consensus toward data points have been
established at present.
The decision-making process in MP is relatively arbitrary
since the data collected during MP are suggestive but not formally
established as quality-defining parameters. Since the decision to
transplant an organ or not is extremely meaningful, great care
needs to be applied in the process, and detailed documentation
of the reasoning for decision making should be carried out. A
greater effort toward orchestrated data collection could help to
streamline and eventually enhance the robustness of the decision￾making process.
The preference for MP to be used for the preservation
of marginal organs results from the greater need for
organ assessment and the greater potential benefit of better
preservation. This might be particularly true and relevant for
organs from uncontrolled DCDs, where the circumstances and
the accumulated damage to the organs might be less clear. The
value of an additional assessment under these conditions is not
only meaningful with respect to the number of additional organs
for transplantation but also for preventing the transplantation
of organs that are severely damaged. While the assessment
of this subject would be highly valuable and is much needed,
the behavior of the investigators in the NMP trial by Nasralla
et al. indicates the limitations and conflicts observed with this
approach (62). Since the trial cannot be fully blinded, the bias
generated by the fact that a technology is used that is deemed
superior and the data generated during MP define a deviation in
the behavior of the decision makers.
THE FAR FUTURE OF (MARGINAL) ORGAN
TRANSPLANTATION
The fantasies building on the realization of extracorporal organ
preservation under physiological conditions are currently
fuelling hopes that this technology could facilitate tissue
regeneration, organ repair, immunomodulation, xenograft
humanification, and many other things. MP as a platform
may impact medicine far beyond transplantation and delivers
a unique chance to alter the treatment of organ failure and
organ disease. Between the imagination and the realization
of medical advancement stands a mountain of work and an
as yet unknown but probably large number of technical and
methodological challenges. An important initial goal is the
expansion of the duration of MP and the establishment of
an equilibrium of the condition of the organ. Preservation
of organs for several days will likely require additional
modifications from the currently existing technologies.
Preservation of the acid-base equilibrium, nutrition organ
weight-induced pressure, electrolyte shift, hemolysis, and many
other challenges may require closer attention. A tissue- and/or
cell-specific and targeted treatment is a realistic consideration,
and proof of concept trials indicate the feasibility of this
approach (196, 197). The treatment and replacement of
damaged or displaced elements of organs may evolve as a
new discipline and help the field to make the leap to serve
one of the greatest unmet needs: The effective treatment of
damaged organs.
