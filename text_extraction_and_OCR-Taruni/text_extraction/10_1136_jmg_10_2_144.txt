Summary. Type I mucopolysaccharidosis was diagnosed in a fetus by assay
of the glycosaminoglycans of the amniotic liquor. Results are presented of bio￾chemical and ultrastructural studies on the 18-week abortus. The evidence sug￾gests that the liver is more severely affected than the central nervous system at this
stage of gestation, and this finding agrees with the recent demonstration of the
underlying enzyme defect of this disorder, with the corollary that many biochemical
abnormalities previously noted in gargoylism must be pleiotropic effects of the
mutant genotype.
Although the prenatal diagnosis of the mucopoly￾saccharidoses was first described by Fratantoni et al
(1969), there still appears to be no wholly satis￾factory single test which will allow these conditions
to be recognized in the fetus both quickly and un￾equivocally. A number of methods have been
proposed, and it has been suggested (Milunsky et al,
1970) that they should be used in parallel. In this
paper we report a case where the diagnosis was
made, termination advised and accepted, and the
fetus was studied by a number of techniques.
Case Report
The family first came to attention when the index case
(III.2, see Fig. 1) was found at the age of 6 months to be
developing slowly and to have a lump on her back.
This child, a girl, was the first-born of non-consan￾guineous parents, though the mother had had a previous
normal daughter by a different father. The diagnosis of
Hurler's syndrome was made and at the age of one year
she was further investigated in the Department of Paedi￾atrics, University of Leeds. At that time she was obese,
had a lumbar kyphosis, was unable to sit up but could

support her head, had plagiocephaly, clouding of the
corneae, and the typical facial appearance of Hurler's
syndrome (Fig. 2). Her liver was enlarged and the
spleen palpable. Radiology showed the typical hooked
vertebrae of Hurler's syndrome in the upper lumbar
region (Fig. 3). Twenty-four urinary hexosamine was
4-6 mg (normal range 1-3 mg).
The mother (II.3) was seen for genetic counselling on
1 February 1972 when it transpired that she was again
pregnant, the date of the last menstrual period being in
some doubt. On referral for obstetric opinion, it was

found that fundal height was compatible with 14-16
weeks' gestation, and it was decided to carry out an
amniocentesis at the earliest opportunity.
This sample was obtained and, after centrifugation,
the cells were retained for culture and the cell-free
liquor subjected to direct assay of glycosaminoglycan
content. As a result of this latter investigation it was
decided to advise termination of the pregnancy by hys￾terotomy, and the whole fetus thus became available for
study at what was probably about the 18th week of ges￾tation. Immediately before the hysterotomy a second
sample of amniotic liquor was withdrawn to provide
material for a sequential study of its glycosaminoglycans.
Immediately after delivery of the fetus samples of liver,
spleen, cerebral tissue, and cerebellum were fixed in
glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy, while the un￾fixed portions of these organs were frozen for eventual
chemical investigation. A portion of skin was cleaned
with surgical spirit, exercised, and placed in sterile
TC199 for fibroblast culture.
Methods
Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans. The cell-free
amniotic fluid was dialysed in Visking tubing, previ￾ously heated at 95° C to reduce its porosity, for 24 hours
against 1 litre of water at 4° C, re-centrifuged, and poly￾anions precipitated from the clarified supematant solu￾tion by dropwise addition of aqueous 9-aminoacridine
hydrochloride (saturated at 60° C). After standing over￾night at 4° Cthe precipitate was collected by centrifugation
and the glycosaminoglycans converted to their sodium

salts by shaking with a suspension of Zeo-Karb 225 (Na +
form) and 1 ml of a sodium acetate buffer (Dean, Muir,
and Ewins, 1971). The total uronic acid content of the
sample was determined (Bitter and Muir, 1962), and the
remainder of the material incubated at 370 C for 24
hours with 3000 turbidity reducing units of testicular
hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35). The undigested glyco￾saminoglycans were precipitated as above and re-con￾verted to their sodium salts. The total uronic acid
content of the remaining glycosaminoglycans (dermatan
and heparan sulphates) was then re-determined.
Glycosaminoglycans were isolated from fetal liver by
extraction with 0-2M sodium acetate, pH 6-8, and the
proportions of heparan, dermatan, and chondroitin sul￾phates determined as described by Dean et al (1971).
Gel chromatography of a 2 mg sample of glycosamino￾glycans isolated from the liver was carried out on a

column of Sephadex G-200 (12 mm x 550 mm) packed
and eluted with 0-2M sodium acetate. Fractions of
0-85 ml were collected and their uronic acid contents
determined.
Tissue Glycosidases. 0-5 g samples of both liver
and cerebral tissue from the fetus under investigation and
from two age-matched control fetuses which had been
aborted for other reasons, were homogenized in 1-5 ml
of iced distilled water on a Silverson laboratory mixer
with micro head. The homogenate was then centrifuged
at 2200 g for 30 min at 40 C, the supernatant solution
being retained undiluted for electrophoresis and diluted
with two volumes of 0-15M sodium citrate/phosphate
buffer, pH 4-5, for direct enzyme assays.
Starch gel electrophoresis was carried out using
sodium phosphate buffers, pH 7 0, 0-01M in the 11%
gel bed and 0-1M in the electrode vessels and paper
bridges. Separation was continued for 17 hours at
2 5V/cm between plates cooled to 2° C, at the end of
which time the gel was split into two, and the upper
and lower sections incubated separately at 370 C with
paper overlays containing approximately 10 ml of 0-1%
4-methylumbelliferyl a- or P-D-galactopyranoside in
citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4-8, for 60 minutes. The
gels were then made alkaline with strong ammonia solu￾tion, which allowed the regions of enzyme activity to be
visualized under a Woods lamp, free methylumbelli￾ferone fluorescing with a blue colour. (For clarity of
reproduction we are publishing the negative images of
these photographs.)
The direct enzyme assays were carried out on the
diluted extracts using 4-methylumbelliferyl esters in
0-15 M citrate/phosphate buffers according to the con￾ditions as given in Table I.
Each estimation was carried out in duplicate with
mixtures of 50 pl of tissue extract and 100 ,ul of substrate
buffer solution in small plastic sample tubes in an air￾blown incubator at 370 C. The reactions were stopped
with 100 ,ul of 5% trichloroacetic acid and the fluores￾cence of the released 4-methylumbelliferone developed
with 2-0 ml of 0-3M NaOH/glycine buffer, pH 10-6,
immediately before reading on a Farrand Ratio Fluoro￾meter fitted with Wratten 18A excitation and 2A emis￾sion filters. These conditions had previously been
shown to give reproducible and linear results.
Electron Microscopy. 1 mm cubes of liver, spleen,
cerebrum, and cerebellum were fixed in 5% glutaralde￾hyde in cacodylate sucrose buffer, pH 7-2, postfixed in
1% veronal acetate buffered osmic acid, dehydrated in
ethanol, and embedded in Araldite. Ultra-thin sections
were obtained with an LKB Ultratone, stained with
aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined
with an AEL EM 6B electron microscope.
Cell Culture. The centrifuged amniotic cells were
re-suspended in 2-0 ml of fetal calf serum, divided
evenly between two 5 cm Carrel flasks, gassed with 5%
CO2 in air, and incubated at 370 C for 4 hours. There￾after 1 ml of 10% fetal calf serum in RPMI medium was
added to each culture which was then incubated for 10
days at 370 C without further interference. The cells
were examined two to three times weekly and sub￾cultured when necessary, feeding being maintained with
10% fetal calf serum in RPMI medium.
The fetal skin biopsy was cut into small fragments,
secured in Carrel flasks by chicken plasma clots, and fed
with medium containing 20% fetal calf serum in Mini￾mal Eagle's Medium supplemented with L-glutamine at
a final concentration of 0-25 mg/ml. Within two weeks
there was sufficient cell growth around the explants to
permit trypsinization of the monolayer and the establish￾ment of subcultures in 2 oz soft glass medical bottles
using 10% fetal calf serum in Minimal Eagle's Medium.
These subcultures were further sub-divided until four
2 oz bottles were obtained. Two days after this final
transfer, in which each bottle received an equal aliquot of
cell suspension, the medium was replaced with the same
mixture as before but containing isotopically labelled
inorganic sulphate (35S04) at a concentration of about
10 ,u Ci/ml. This was left in contact with the cells for
one week, after which the cells were washed three times
with sterile Hank's A balanced salt solution and then fed
with Minimal Eagle's Medium supplemented with either
pooled human serum or new born calf serum in 30%
mixture and buffered with 0-5M HEPES, pH 7 0. One
bottle was harvested directly. Twenty-four hours later

the medium was decanted from the remaining cultures
and the cells again washed with Hank's A solution several
times before being digested in situ with 2 ml of NCS
solubilizer (Amersham Searle) for two hours at 600 C.
The resultant solution was mixed with 20 ml of 055%
BBOT in 4:1 toluene methanol. Aliquots (400 [L) of
the decanted medium from each bottle were dried onto
strips of Whatman No. 1 filter paper and immersed in
0-5%// BBOT in toluene in scintillation vials. Both
types of sample were counted in a Packard scintillation
counter.
Results and Discussion
Using phenyl-a-L-iduronide as substrate, Bach
et al (1972) and Matalon and Dorfman (1972) have
recently discovered independently that the basic
enzymic lesion in Hurler's syndrome is a defect in
lysosomal a-L-iduronidase (see also McKusick et al,
1972). This hydrolytic enzyme plays a major part
in the degradation of dermatan sulphate, a glyco￾saminoglycan whose main chain repeating disaccha￾ride unit consists of /3-galactosaminyl-a-L-iduronic
acid. Removal of terminal non-reducing iduronic
acid residues is normally carried out by a-L-idu￾ronidase, and in the absence of this enzyme further
attack on the chain by exo-glycosidases is impossible.
Patients with Hurler's syndrome accumulate a
number of different storage products in different
tissues-predominantly low molecular weight der￾matan and heparan sulphates in the liver (Knecht et
al, 1967), materials which are also found in excess
in the urine of these cases, and a range of ganglio￾sides in the central nervous system (Ledeen et al,
1965). While there can now be lttle doubt that the
lack of iduronidase is the causative lesion, a number
of other enzymic disturbances have been dis￾covered in tissues and cell cultures from these
children, the most remarkable being the great
diminution in 3-galactosidase B activity in the liver
(Ockerman and Hultberg, 1968; van Hoof and Hers,
1968/1969) and other tissues (MacBrinn et al,
1969). It seems reasonable to postulate that the
accumulation of substance other than dermatan
sulphate may be due to these secondary enzyme
changes, which may in turn be due to the high levels
of this glycosaminoglycan altering the intra￾lysosomal milieu.
At the time that this investigation was undertaken
the basic defect had not been described in full, and
it was necessary to use detection systems acting on
the secondary changes to attempt to define the geno￾type of the unborn child. Two main approaches
could be made to this problem-one described by
Matalon et al (1970) consisted in a direct assay of
the glycosaminoglycans of the liquor amnii, the
other involving observation of the metabolism of
sulphated macromolecules in cells cultured from
the fetus.
One might expect that the liquor amnii of an
affected fetus should always contain an excess of
dermatan sulphate, as was reported by Matalon
et al (1970) and confirmed in this case, since the
metabolic error is expressed in many cases even
before the birth of the child. Umbilical hernias,
indicative of some connective tissue disturbance,
are very common in affected neonates (Leroy and
Crocker, 1966). Unfortunately, not only does the
normal level of total glycosaminoglycans vary with
the advance of pregnancy, but also in a disturbing
number of cases the liquor has appeared to be nor￾mal and the resulting child found to be abnormal
after being carried to term and delivered (Brock et al,
1971; Matalon et al, 1972). The reasons for these
false negative results are not understood, but we
may postulate either that the low molecular weight
glycosaminoglycans can pass the placental barrier
and be degraded by maternal tissues, or that mater￾nal iduronidase may enter the fetus and prevent the
accumulation of dermatan sulphate. The incon￾sistencies between different cases may depend upon
one of many factors, the genetic constitutions of the
fetus and the mother, the exact nature of the enzy￾mic deficiency, or mechanical factors such as trans￾placental haemorrhage infusing the fetus with
maternal cells. No figures appear to have been
published on the relative frequency of positive and
negative results of these assays in cases where the
fetus had Hurler's syndrome.
In our case the uronic acid content of the amnio￾tic fluid was 20-5 ,ug/ml, and since glycosamino￾glycans normally contain some 30%/ by weight of
uronic acid (Olsson, 1969; Dean et al, 1971) this
value corresponded to a glycosaminoglycan content
of about 60 ,tg/ml. Of this total 78%' was resistant
to digestion with hyaluronidase, ie, consisted of
dermatan and heparan sulphates, the remainder
consisted of hyaluronic acid together with the
chondroitin sulphates. This high proportion of
resistant glycosaminoglycans corresponded closely
with the report of Matalon et al (1970) of findings
on an affected fetus, and was considered to be ade￾quate evidence to advise termination of the preg￾nancy. These biochemical assays required some 10
days for completion, the results being available
considerably earlier than could be achieved by the
study of cultured amniotic cells.
Much of the interest of this case arises from the
examination of the abortus. We have been able to
show that the liver and other tissues presented
appearances analogous to those found in affected
children at considerably later stages of the disease.

Examination of the electron micrographs of the

lysosomal changes described postnatally by van
Hoof and Hers (1964) and Callahan and Lorincz

few osmiophilic inclusions being present in almost
every cell. The early development of these storage
depots argues for their primary role in the develop￾ment of the disease, much as the demonstration of
multi-lamellar bodies in the central nervous system
of early fetuses with GM2 gangliosidosis demon￾strates the importance of N-acetyl-,B-hexosaminidase
A in the aetiology of Tay-Sachs disease (Schneck

the subsidiary nature of the ganglioside accumula￾tion of this disease, already known to be non-specific

The glycosidases of both liver and cerebrum were
however somewhat disturbed, though the changes in
the former tissues were not so great as reported by
other workers on material from older children with
Hurler's syndrome. Starch gel electrophoresis of
the liver extracts (Fig. 7) show anomalies of both a￾and 3-galactosidases, the slow migrating bands be￾ing in each case markedly reduced compared with

Results of the assay of a range of lysosomal en￾zymes on the crude extracts of both liver and brain
are given in Table II, and are expressed as nano￾Moles of substrate cleaved/hour/mg wet weight of

both a- and P-galactosidases with absolute increases
in most of the other enzymes examined. These
abnormalities although evident are not nearly so
striking as the changes described in the liver of
affected children aged one year and over. This
intermediate reduction of the galactosidases would
be not unexpected if the observed level of these
enzymes were subject to modification by the ac￾cumulation of intralysosomal glycosaminoglycans.
Such tertiary enzyme defects would explain not
only the presence of diminished /-galactosidase levels

in a number of genetically distinct mucopoly￾saccharidoses, but also the quaternary accumulation
of storage products whose structure cannot readily
be related to the primary biochemical lesion, such
as the gangliosides of brain and liver.
As a final confirmation of the genetic status of this
abortus, the 35S04 turnover in cells cultured from
the fetal skin was compared with that of normal
dermal fibroblasts. Neufeld and her collaborators
(Neufeld and Fratantoni, 1970) have, in a series of
papers, built up much of our understanding of
mucopolysaccharidoses. At the outset they showed
that cells cultured from patients with these dis￾orders did not synthesize sulphated glycosamino￾glycans at an accelerated rate, but rather that loss of
35S04 from the cellular pool proceeded too slowly.
Their major achievement was to show that this
metabolic error could be corrected by humoral
factors from normal individuals or their cells, or
from patients with other types of mucopoly￾saccharidosis. These corrective factors prevent the
pathological accumulation of sulphated material in
the abnormal cells or lead to their rapid degradation
and release from the intracellular stores once they
have been built up. In several instances these
factors have proved to be identical with the lyso￾somal enzyme deficiency specific to the condition
(McKusick et al, 1972).
In these observations we have shown (Table III),
that the cells from the abortus accumulate excessive
quantities of labelled sulphate and that the storage
products are released rather more quickly in the
presence of human serum, which contains some
Hurler corrective factor, than in calf serum, which
has no correcting capacity. This behaviour agrees
well with the observations of other workers on cells
from patients with Hurler's syndrome.
With regard to prenatal diagnosis of Hurler's
syndrome in further cases, the best approach re￾mains the combination of quantitative and quali￾tative determination of the glycosaminoglycans of
the liquor amnii, and the sulphate turnover of
cultured amniotic cells. It is to be hoped, however,
that before long it will be possible to assay cc-L￾iduronidase directly in amniotic cells, either by
direct harvest or after short periods of cultivation.
By either approach, the development of 4-methyl￾umbelliferyl substrate would appear to offer the best
prospect of detecting a very low level of enzyme
activity. It still seems prudent to retain a cautious
approach in counselling patients who are not preg￾nant as to the reliability of early prenatal diagnosis,
but most affected fetuses should be detected by the
20th week of gestation when amniocentesis is under￾taken at the 14th-15th week. There can be no
doubt, however, that should the amniotic culture
fail to give an unequivocal normal result termination
should be strongly advised, since the glycosamino￾glycan assay gives too many false negative results.
We are grateful to Dr C. S. Livingstone who made the
original diagnosis in the index case; and to Professor
R. W. Smithells and Dr J. M. H. Buckler of the Depart￾ment of Paediatrics, University of Leeds, for permission
to report their findings on the index case and to the latter
also for his helpful comments; and to Mr H. N. Mac￾donald for the first amniocentesis. We should like to
thank the Medical Research Council for a grant to
M.F.D.
