SERUM TRANSAMINASE LEVELS IN LIVER DISEASE
BY
L. HENRY
From the Department of Chemical Pathology, St. George's Hospital, London
(RECEIVED FOR PUBLICATION AUGUST 2, 1958)
The process of transamination takes place in
many tissues in the body and is a fundamental
mechanism in the metabolism of amino-acids.
Basically it consists of the reversible transfer of
an amino group from an amino-acid to a keto
acid, providing a link between protein and
carbohydrate metabolism.
Although there appear to be a multitude of
transamination systems, each catalysed by a
specific enzyme, clinical interest centres on the
following two reactions.

Glutamic Oxaloacetic
Acid Acid
COOH
GH2
CH2 +
CHNH2
Glutamic
Acid
CH3
C=O
GOGH
Pyruvic
Acid
The first reaction is catalysed by glutamic￾oxaloacetic transaminase (GO-T) and the second
by glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GP-T).
Measurements are usually made of the serum
levels (SGO-T and SGP-T) of these enzymes.
It is presumed that the enzymes are liberated
into the circulation during a period of cellular
necrosis involving a tissue rich in transaminases.
Cardiac muscle has a high content of
GO-transaminase, and the high serum levels
found in patients with myocardial infarction may
be of value in the differential diagnosis of this
condition. High levels have also been noted in
acute hepatitis (Wroblewski, Jervis, and LaDue,
1956; Madson, Bang, and Iversen, 1958). In
addition to its content of GO-T, the liver has a
high concentration of GP-transaminase, and
serum levels may also be raised in liver disease
(Wroblewski and LaDue, 1956). Apart from a
slight and inconstant rise in myocardial infarction
(cardiac muscle contains much less GP-T than
does the liver) these authors failed to detect a rise
in SGP-T levels in the absence of liver disease.
Therefore parallel determinations of SGO-T
and SGP-T may prove to be a sensitive test of
liver function. They may also be used as an aid
in differential diagnosis, as the relative amounts of
the two enzymes vary in differing forms of liver
disease (Wroblewski, 1957).
The development of simple methods for the
measurement of transaminases in serum has now
brought such estimations within the range of the
routine laboratory. The present survey was
undertaken in order to assess the relationship
between the SGO-T and SGP-T levels in patients
with liver disease, and to compare these findings
with the routine liver function tests.
Methods
Transaminase levels may be measured by
incubation of the serum with substrate mixtures of
a-ketoglutaric acid and either aspartic acid or
alanine. The amount of glutamic acid produced may
be determined by quantitative chromatography
(Karmen, Wr6blewski, and LaDue, 1955), but the
method is unsuited to routine work. A spectrophoto￾metric method has been devised by these authors
(Karmen, 1955 ; Wroblewski and LaDue, 1956) where￾by the oxaloacetic or pyruvic acids formed are
brought into a second enzyme system with reduced
diphosphopyridine nucleotide. This reaction is
catalysed by the addition of malic (for SGO-T) or
lactic (for SGP-T) dehydrogenases with the
formation of respectively malic and lactic acids. The
rate of disappearance of the oxaloacetic or pyruvic
acids is followed on a spectrophotometer. This
method requires a suitable instrument and the
provision of purified dehydrogenases, but has been
used with success by Wr6blewski and his colleagues

and has been applied to routine use in Britain
(Pryse-Davies and Wilkinson, 1958).
The SGO-T and SGP-T levels in this survey were
estimated by a modification of the methods of
Cabaud, Leeper, and Wr6blewski (1956) and of
Reitman and Frankel (1957) reported by Mohun
and Cook (1957).
The oxaloacetic acid formed in the reaction is
converted to pyruvic acid by aniline citrate. The
addition of 2.4 dinitro-phenylhydrazine results in the
formation of pyruvic phenylhydrazone which gives a
reddish-brown colour when made alkaline.
This method seems to be ideally suited to routine
use, as it is simple to perform and requires no special
apparatus or reagents.
Measurements were made on a " unicam " S.P. 350
spectrophotometer at 505 mat, but an EEL portable
colorimeter may be used instead. As highly coloured
or haemolysed serum may produce falsely high
readings, a "serum blank " as recommended by
Mohun and Cook (1957) was included in each
estimation. The results were converted into the units
proposed by Cabaud et al. (1956) by a calibration
curve described by Mohun and Cook (1957). The
upper limits of normal were taken to be 40 units/ml.
for both SGO and SGP-T, and an analysis of 100
duplicate estimations showed a standard deviation of
3 units/ml. for levels below 300 units/ml. If levels
of over 300 units/ml. were obtained the estimation
was repeated using serum diluted with M/ 15
Sorensen buffer of pH 7.5.
The routine liver function tests performed were:
Total serum bilirubin (upper limit 1.0 mg./100 ml.),
alkaline phosphatase (13 K-A units/100 ml.), thymol
turbidity (3 units), and thymol flocculation.
Electropheretic Mobility
Shepherd and McDonald (1958) reported that the
SGO transaminase moved with the a2-globulin, and
an attempt was made to separate the SGO and SGP
enzymes on a basis of differing electrophoretic
mobility on paper. In five cases of infective
hepatitis the initial actixity of the serum was high
enough to enable this to be done.
Serum, 0.1 ml., was subjected to electrophoresis on
3MM Whatman paper and the run was performed in
triplicate. When the albumin had moved about
3-4 in., two of the strips were cut into I in. sections
which were eluted into M/15 Sorensen buffer pH 7.5
and assayed for GO- and GP-T activity respectively.
The third strip was stained to show the position of the
protein fractions.
The results of two such estimations are shown in
Fig. 1. In all five cases there was a clear-cut
difference between the electrophoretic mobilities of
the two enzymes. The GP-transaminase moves with
or just behind the 8-globulin while the GO-T moves
with the a2-globulin or is intermediate in mobility
between the a2- and 8-globulins. This confirms
similar observations by Pryse-Davies and Wilkinson
(1958).
Results
Specimens of blood passing through the
laboratory for routine liver function tests were
all examined for transaminase activity, and cases
were noted where either or both of these were
abnormal. In this way a total of 64 cases was
selected, comprising 16 patients with acute
hepatitis, 25 with obstructive jaundice, 17 with
chronic liver disease, and six with hepatic
metastases. The results of the routine liver
function tests and transaminase estimations in
each of these groups are shown in Tables I-IV.
Acute Hepatitis.-It is in this condition that
the highest levels of transaminase activity are
found. The liver has a high content of both
enzymes, which are liberated during the phase of
active hepatocellular damage. Examination of
homogenates of liver from post-mortem specimens
showed that the concentration of GP-T was
greater than that of thle GO enzyme (this result
is in conflict with those of Wroblewski and
LaDue (1956), who report less GP-T than GO-T
in liver). Thus, in cases of acute hepatitis, the
SGP-T level might be expected to exceed the
SGO-T and this is in fact observed in all the cases
examined.

molecules lies between 11 and 24 days, and from
the slope of degradation the half life is of the
order of seven to 10 days. This is roughly in
line with the existing estimate (Martin, 1957) of
a half life of 10 days for pseudo-cholinesterase,
another of the a2-globulins (Kekwick, 1955).
Fig. 4 shows the general relationship between
the duration of the disease and the serum
transaminase levels in 14 cases of acute hepatitis.
In the two cases shown graphically (Figs. 2 and 3),
there was a close correlation between the
transaminase levels and routine liver function
tests, but this was not so in every case. In two
patients (H. R. and D. O., Table I), the routine
tests were normal, but the raised transaminase
levels presumably indicated that the period of
activity of the disease had been prolonged, and in
four cases (J. K., D. F., J. P. R., and B. R.,
Table I) the liver function tests were abnormal in
the presence of normal transaminases. This
makes it doubtful if the latter can be considered in
isolation in assessing the progress of acute
hepatitis. However, SGO-T determinations were
used by O'Brien, Goble, and MacKay (1958) to
assess the effectiveness of cortisone in chronic
hepatitis. The findings in acute hepatitis
complicating glandular fever are similar to those
in infective hepatitis.
The serum levels of both enzymes will rise until
the cellular necrosis is at its maximum and will
thereafter fall to normal limits. The level at any
particular time will therefore be governed (a) by
the amount of active necrosis causing a fresh
release of enzyme, and (b) by the normal processes
of globulin metabolism which will remove the
enzyme from the circulation. When the acute
phase is over, only (b) will operate, but if the liver
damage continues an equilibrium will be attained
and the serum level of the enzymes will remain
elevated. This is presumably the case in patients
with subacute hepatitis (Cases S. U., A. P., and
G. S. in Table III).
In the cases shown in Figs. 2 and 3 the steady
clinical improvement after the icteric phase and
the gradual decline in the liver function tests to
normal led us to postulate that the period of
necrosis was not prolonged. The pattern of
decline of the serum transaminase activity in these
cases was of interest, as it afforded a measure of
the rate of metabolism of the a- and al-globulins.
If the levels are plotted against time on a semi￾logarithmic scale the rate of decay is
approximately the same for both enzymes in each
case. The survival time of the biologically active

FIG. 4.-The relationship between the duration of the disease and the serum transaminase levels in 14 cases of acute hepatitis.
Obstructive Jaundice.-Twenty-five cases of
obstructive jaundice were studied (Table II) and
in only two cases (E. H. and S. W.) were the
transaminase levels within normal limits. In all
the other cases the SGP-T level was raised, this
being associated with a smaller rise in SGO-T
levels in 16 cases and a normal SGO-T level in the
remaining six. In only one case (M. G.) did the
SGO-T exceed the SGP-T level.
The liver function tests showed a constant
pattern, namely, a raised bilirubin and alkaline
phosphatase level with a normal thymol turbidity
and flocculation reaction. The extent to which
the transaminase levels were raised bore no
constant relationship to the degree of abnormality
of the routine tests. The one case (N. W.) in
which these were normal showed extremely high
transaminase levels and was judged clinically to
have had an attack of biliary colic associated with
gall stones.
The two cases of jaundice complicating largactil
therapy are included in this group, as both the
clinical and biochemical findings in such cases are
similar to those in patients with extrahepatic
biliary obstruction.

(Cases U. V., A. P., and G. S.) and acute-on￾chronic (Cases A. S. and R. A.) types both
transaminases are raised, the SGP-T showing the
greater increase. This would be consistent with
a process of active liver cell damage. Of the 12
patients with established chronic liver damage, the
serum levels of both enzymes were normal in two,
the SGO-T was greater than SGP-T in five cases,
the SGP-T being greater in the other five cases.
There was no constant relationship to the routine
tests, but a high thymol turbidity value seems
often to be associated with a raised SGO-T level.
Secondary Carcinoma.-In these cases, the
routine tests usually reveal a rise in the alkaline
phosphatase level, and Table IV shows that in six
cases with hepatic metastases this was a constant
feature. In all cases the SGP-T level was raised
and was higher than the SGO-T level in the four
cases where this was also raised.
In patients with skeletal metastases the alkaline
phosphatase may be raised, but the transaminase
levels will be normal. In one such patient with
secondary deposits in bone but none in the
liver the alkaline phosphatase was 91 units/
100 ml. and the SGO and SGP-T levels were 13
and 6 units/ml. respectively.

Discussion
The method of Mohun and Cook (1957) was
found to work very well in practice and can be
carried out easily in a routine laboratory. On the
whole the results obtained agree with those
of Wroblewski (1957) and Pryse-Davies and
Wilkinson (1958) using the spectrophotometric
method.
In acute hepatitis the high levels of
transaminase in the serum make the estimations a
very sensitive test of liver function, the SGP-T
levels being higher than the SGO-T in the acute
phase. Serial assays are useful in following the
progress of the disease, but the levels may not
necessarily be a more sensitive index than the
routine tests. We would agree with Wroblewski
(1957) when he states that transaminase
estimations should not be considered in isolation
but when taken in conjunction with other
biochemical and clinical findings may prove to be
of value. A persistently raised transaminase level
will presumably indicate continuing liver cell
damage.
In chronic liver disease the transaminases are
not always abnormal, and where they are raised
the relationships between the SGO-T and SGP-T
levels are so variable that it is doubtful if any
firm conclusions can be drawn from them. On
the other hand in all his cases of cirrhosis
Wroblewski (1957) found a constant rise in the
SGO-T which always exceeded the SGP-T level.
The most consistent findings were in cases of
obstructive jaundice where almost every case
showed a rise in the SGP-T level over that of
SGO-T. Pryse-Davies and Wilkinson (1958)
found this ratio to be reversed in their series, but
our results would confirm those of Wr6blewski
(1957), whose method was used by the latter
authors. Unfortunately the estimations are of the
least value in this group, as it is usually easy to
diagnose extrahepatic obstructive jaundice on
clinical grounds and by routine liver function
tests.
In cases of secondary carcinoma we found the
SGP-T levels to be consistently elevated, whereas
Wroblewski (1957) reports a higher rise in
SGO-T levels. However, the number of patients
in our series is too small to allow any definite
conclusions to be drawn.
Summary
Serum transaminase levels were estimated in 64
cases of liver disease and the results compared
with the routine liver function tests. Particular
attention was paid to the relation between the
serum levels of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and deter￾minations of these were found to be a sensitive
test of liver function.
The electrophoretic mobilities of the enzymes
were confirmed, the GO-transaminase moving
with the a2-globulin and the GP-transaminase
with the 8-globulin.
My thanks are due to Professor N. H. Martin for
his advice and encouragement while carrying out
this work.
