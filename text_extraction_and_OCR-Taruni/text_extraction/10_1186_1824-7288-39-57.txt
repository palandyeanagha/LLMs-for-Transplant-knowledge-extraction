tuberous sclerosis?

Abstract
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by the development of
hamartomas in several organs. Mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes determin overactivation
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and subsequent abnormalities in numerous cell
processes. As a result, mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus have the potential to provide targeted
therapy for TSC patients. Everolimus has been recently approved as a pharmacotherapy option for TSC patients
with subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) or renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). However, clinical evidence
suggests that this treatment can benefit other TSC-associated disease manifestations, such as skin manifestations,
pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and epilepsy. Therefore, the positive effects that
mTOR inhibition have on a wide variety of TSC disease manifestations make this a potential systemic treatment
option for this genetic multifaceted disorder.

Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a variably expressed
autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by
the presence of benign, non-invasive, tumor-like lesions
(hamartomas) in the brain, heart, skin, kidney, lung, and
liver [1]. This disorder has an estimated birth incidence
of approximately 1 in 6000 [2]. Central Nervous System
is almost invariably affected in TSC (85–90% of chil￾dren and adolescents), causing disabling neurological
manifestations, including epilepsy (up to 90% of patients
with TSC), subependymal nodules (SENs; 90–100%),
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs; 5–20%),
and mental delay (44–64%) [1]. Other brain manifestations
include widespread microstructural white matter ab￾normalities [3]. Non neurologic manifestations include
hypomelanotic macules and facial angiofibromas, renal
cysts and/or angiomylipomas, pulmonary lymphangiolei￾omyomatosis, cardiac rhabdomyomas, retinal hamartomas
and hepatic angiomas [1]. In TSC, mutations in one of the
two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 (encoding hamartin)
or TSC2 (encoding tuberin), are found in more than
85% of cases [4]. Hamartin and tuberin are involved in
the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation,
forming a physical and functional complex that activates
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), keeping the protein
Ras homolog enriched in brain protein (RHEB) inactive
in order to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway. The mTOR pathway is responsible for
protein and lipid biosynthesis and growth factor-related
cell cycle progression. Under normal circumstances,
hamartin and tuberin are activated ivia biosynthetic
processes mediated by the mTORC1 complex, which
includes mTOR, raptor (mTOR regulatory-associated
protein of mTOR), mLST8, and PRAS40 (proline-rich
Akt substrate 40) [5]. Therefore, TSC1 or TSC2 mutations
give rise to hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway,
resulting in a downstream kinase signaling cascade that
can lead to abnormalities in numerous cell processes,
including cell cycle progression, transcription, translation,
and metabolic control [5]. Progress in understanding
the molecular pathophysiology of TSC and the crucial
role of mTOR hyperactivation in determining most of the
clinical features in TSC paved the way to the development
of new therapeutic strategies involving mTOR inhibitors.
This review will focus on the current role of mTOR * Correspondence: rominamoavero@hotmail.com 1

inhibitors in systemic treatment of different TSC related
manifestations.
Neurologic manifestations of TSC
Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas
Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are slow￾growing tumors of mixed cellular lineage, occurring in
about 5–20% of TSC patients, and represent a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality because of the risk of
sudden death from acute hydrocephalus [6,7].
mTOR inhibitors’ efficacy in determining a reduction
of SEGA volume is now well established, so that Eve￾rolimus has been the first drug specifically licensed in
the USA and Europe for the treatment of TSC patients
aged ≥3 years with TSC-related SEGA who require
therapeutic intervention, but are not candidates for
curative surgical resection.
The evidence of this efficacy comes from phase I/II
open-label trial as well as from an international phase III
study [8,9]. EXIST-1 (Examining everolimus In a Study of
TSC) was a phase III international, multicenter, double￾blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated
the efficacy and safety of everolimus in 117 patients
with SEGA associated with TSC. The primary endpoint
of EXIST-1 was the proportion of patients with a SEGA
response (confirmed by MRI 8–12 weeks after the
response), defined as a reduction from baseline of ≥50%
in the sum volumes of all target SEGA lesions, non￾worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, no new SEGA
lesions ≥1 cm, and no new/worsening hydrocephalus.
Everolimus was associated with a significantly greater
overall SEGA response rate, compared with placebo (35%
vs. 0%; p < 0.0001); this benefit was consistent across all
patient subgroups analyzed [8]. The median time-to￾SEGA progression was not reached, but the estimated
progression-free rate at 6 months was significantly higher
with everolimus (100% vs. 86%; p = 0.0002).
In our experience with Everolimus, SEGA volume
reduction was greater in the first 3 months of treatment,
but SEGAs usually continued to respond until at least
12–18 months of continuative treatment. Furthermore,
in patients with a pre-existing hydrocephalus, ventricles’
enlargement appeared to significantly decrease even
before a significant reduction of SEGA volume. In par￾ticular, in our series, one patient began his treatment
with Everolimus soon after an episode of subacute
hydrocephalus treated with an external drainage, and
although SEGA volume shrinked to less than 50% only
after 12 months of treatment, ventricles’ enlargement
was significantly decreased after the first three months
of pharmacotherapy (Figure 1).
Epilepsy
Epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis generally
begins during the first year of life and, in most patients,
in the first few months. Focal seizures may precede, co￾exist with, or evolve into infantile spasms [1]. Animal
models showed that mTOR inhibitors proved to have
antiepileptic and even antiepileptogenic effect, decreasing
seizures when started after epilepsy onset of seizures,
or preventing the development of epilepsy when initi￾ated prior to the onset of seizures [10]. There is some
A B
Figure 1 SEGA volume reduction during Everolimus treatment. A boy with a TSC2 mutation showed progressively growing SEGAs that
caused a first acute hydrocephalus when he was 17 years old. He therefore underwent a partial resection of the lesion, with hydrocephalus
resolution. However, two years later, the contralateral SEGAs determined a new episode of hydrocephalus and he underwent surgery once again.
However, both lesions presented a slow regrowth after surgeries, and figure (A) shows their aspect when the boy was 24 years of age. He later
presented a new episode of subacute hydrocephalus, which required an external derivation. He subsequently started Everolimus treatment, with
a partial response (total lesion volume 46% of baseline) of SEGAs after 12 months of treatment (B).

evidence showing that rapamycin might be a disease
modifier agent in epileptic spasms, even not specifically
related to TSC, but it doesn’t seem to have the same
efficacy on other seizure types [11]. Different models
show that beneficial effects on seizures are lost when
treatment is withdrawn, suggesting that mTOR inhibitors
are “epileptostatic” in only stalling epilepsy progression
during treatment [12].
Clinical studies of rapamycin in human epilepsy are
limited, but suggest that mTOR inhibitors at least have
antiseizure effects in tuberous sclerosis patients. Further
studies are needed to assess the full potential of mTOR
inhibitors for epilepsy treatment. Up to now there are
only few clinical data reporting about efficacy and safety
of mTOR inhibitors in epilepsy secondary to TSC. Most
of these data come from clinical trials investigating the
efficacy of Everolimus on SEGAs, or from anecdotical
case reports. The EXIST-1 trial failed to demonstrate
a reduction in seizure frequency after 6 months of
Everolimus treatment [8]. On the other hand, single
case reports seem to indicate some efficacy in reducing
seizure frequency in TSC patients receving mTOR in￾hibitors [13,14].
In our clinical experience of TSC epileptic patients
treated with Everolimus for SEGA and/or AMLs, epi￾leptic seizures appeared to decrease both in frequency
and in severity (Figure 2). Furthermore, seizures tend to
become less dangerous for the patient, thus determining
a minor impact on the patient’s quality of life. However,
after the discontinuation of treatment seizures promptly
appeared again with the same frequency as before
Everolimus. In the clinical practice caution should be
used when Everolimus is added to antiepileptic drugs
such as especially carbamazepine, topiramate, barbitu￾rates and phenytoin; clinicians should be aware of the
pharmacokynetic and pharmacodynamic interactions
between these different drugs, as well as of the possible
adverse events.
Mental delay and autism
TSC associated neurocognitive manifestations are quite
frequent in TSC, and highly variable in their expression.
Cognitive impairment is present in about half of TSC
patients, with 30% being profoundly impaired [1]. Most
important variables associated with poor cognitive out￾come and autism spectrum disorder include a history of
refractory seizures, mutations of TSC2, and the presence
of cortical tubers in certain regions [15], but age at seizure
onset appears to be one of the major contributor to cogni￾tive function [16]. About 70–75% of patients experiencing
seizures in the first year of life, including infantile spasms,
could present a later cognitive impairment [17], however
an early and effective treatment soon after seizure onset
can significantly ameliorate the final outcome, although
it is not able to totally reverse TSC- associated cognitive
impairment [18,19]. Evidence on animal models showed
that mTOR signalling plays a crucial role in different
social behaviours as well as in learning deficit [20], and
a brief treatment with rapamycin rescued not only synap￾tic plasticity but also behavioral deficits [21]. Furthermore
the treatment both before and after early seizures with
mTOR inhibitors was able to decrease both seizure

she was 20 years old she presented mainly secondarily generalized tonic and tonic-clonic seizures. The image shows her seizure frequency per
month before and during Everolimus treatment. With everolimus seizure frequency decreased, generalized seizures stopped, and she continued
to have only focal onset seizures of short duration, without drop attacks nor falling to the ground.

susceptibility and later autistic-like behaviours [22], thus
supporting the hypothesis that mTOR inhibitors could
be useful for the pharmacological treatment of TSC
associated autism spectrum disorders. Recent clinical
xevidence also showed that treatment with mTOR in￾hibitors appeared to be able to decrease white matter
abnormalities, even if the exact clinical significance of
this finding is still unknown (Tillema et al., 2012). Clinical
trials to examine the effects of mTORC1 inhibitors on
neurocognitive function, autistic phenotypes and epilepsy
are currently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01289912,
NCT01070316).
Non-neurologic manifestations of TSC
Renal AMLs
Renal complications are the most frequent cause of
tuberous-sclerosis-related death [6]. Multiple, bilateral
angiomyolipomas are found in about 70–90% of adult
patients [1]. Their frequency is lower in children than
in adults, but up to 16% of patients below the age of
2 years can be affected [23]. These tumours, consisting
of abnormal blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose
tissue, tend to grow and spontaneous bleeding is the
most common complication in patients with tumours
larger than 4 cm in diameter [1].
Different clinical trials have been performed in order
to establish the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitors in
reducing AML size. Two different studies administering
sirolimus reported a reduction in tumor volume of
more than 50%, but a regrowth after treatment cessation
[24,25]. Furthermore, also in this case an international,
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
study has been carried on, assessing the efficacy and
safety of everolimus in 118 patients with AML associ￾ated with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleyomyomatosis
(LAM). The primary efficacy endpoint for EXIST-2 was
the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall
AML response (confirmed by kidney computed tomog￾raphy/MRI 8–12 weeks after the response), which was
defined as a reduction from baseline of ≥50% in the
sum of volumes of all target AML lesions, no new le￾sions ≥1 cm in the longest diameter, no kidney volume
increase of >20% from nadir, and no AML-related bleed￾ing grade ≥2 (defined by the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, ver￾sion 3.0). Everolimus was associated with a significantly
greater AML response rate, compared with placebo
(41.8% vs. 0%; p < 0.0001); this benefit was consistent
across all patient subgroups analyzed. The median
time-to-AML progression was 11.4 months in the placebo
group, but was not reached in the everolimus treatment
group (hazard ratio 0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.37; p < 0.0001);
estimated 6-month progression-free rates of 98.4% and
83.4% were reported in the everolimus and placebo
groups, respectively [26].
In our series AMLs responded even better than SEGAs.
When the patient is a responder, already in the first three
months a reduction of more than 50% of the baseline
volume is observed. In our experience with long-term
treatment, we observed a continuous progression of
volume decrease even after 2 or 3 years of continuative
treatment, in one case with the total lesion volume
decreasing up to 13% of the baseline (Figure 3).
Dermatologic manifestations
Bilateral facial angiofibromas are hamartomatous nodules
of vascular and connective tissue, with a butterfly pattern
over the malar eminences and nasal labial folds of the
face [1]. Their frequency is about 80% in children with
tuberous sclerosis who are older than 5 years of age
[27]. Dermatologic manifestations response to mTOR
inhibitors has been extensively investigated in recent
years. Most of the studies have been specifically performed
with topical formulation of sirolimus, but some indirect
data also come from the systemic administration of siro￾limus/everolimus in patients treated for AML or SEGAs
[8,24,26].
Most of the actual experience up to now is with facial
angiofibromas, which appears to present a good response
to topical administration of mTOR inhibitors, even if a

after 144 weeks of treatment with Everolimus (85% of volume reduction).

standardized protocol of use is still lacking [28-31].
Topical rapamycin formulation has also been tested in
hypomelanotic macules, showing some efficacy even if
up to now there are only two reported cases [32].
Some of the patients we treated for SEGAs and/or AMLs
also presented facial angiofibromas. During everolimus
treatment these skin lesions tended to clear up, and be￾came more plan already after 2–4 weeks of treatment
(Figure 4).
Cardiac rhabdomyomas
Cardiac rhabdomyomas are the main feature of the disease
in the fetus and newborn baby. 96% of infants with cardiac
rhabdomyomas will ultimately be diagnosed with tuberous
sclerosis. Although patients typically have several, these
tumours are rarely symptomatic. Nonetheless, they can
manifest prenatally as arrhythmia, non-immune hydrops,
or death [1]. Cardiac rhabdomyomas are the main feature
of the disease in the fetus and newborn baby. Lesions may
be completely asymptomatic and usually recede over time,
with complete regression in childhood [1,33]. However,
before their regression, cardiac rhabdomyomas may cause
clinically significant arrhythmias, ventricular inflow and
outflow obstruction, and congestive heart failure. For these
patients, medication is needed to treat arrhythmias and
heart failure, and surgery may be required to relieve
obstruction [1,34].
A recent case report described the regression of a
cardiac rhabdomyoma in a 7 year old boy treated with
Everolimus for SEGA [34]. Even if a natural regression
can not be excluded, the rapidity of the regression may
suggest that Everolimus could have played a significant
role. Further data are necessary to understand if TSC
related cardiac manifestations could be a target for mTOR
inhibiton.
LAM
Pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis predominantly affects
fertile women and can be progressive and with a poor
prognosis [1]. Positive data regarding mTOR inhibitors
efficacy in pulmonary LAM come both from case series
and from specific randomized trials, even if these were
not initially designed for TSC patients [35-37]. A phase
III, randomized and double-blind placebo controlled
trial have been performed investigating the efficacy and
safety of sirolimus in lymphangioleyomiomatosis in
adult patients with and without TSC. This study dem￾onstrated that at the end of the treatment period, FEV1
stabilized or improved in 46% of patients on sirolimus,
but when the drug was stopped, lung function decline
resumed [35]. Sirolimus treated group also showed an
improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) and in
measures of functional performance and quality of life,
but not in exercise tolerance.
Furthermore, clinical assessing sirolimus/everolimus
treatment in TSC-related AML showed a slight improve￾ment, or at least a stabilization, in lung function in
patients affected by LAM [24-26].
Current role in the clinical practice
mTOR inhibition is a novel therapeutic approach that
can address multiple aspects of the TSC disease at the
Figure 4 Facial angiofibroma before and during Everolimus treatment. Facial angiofibroma of the same boy presented in Figure 1 at
baseline (A) and after 84 weeks of treatment with Everolimus (B).

same time. In TSC the major causes of mortality are
SEGA-related hydrocephalus, status epilepticus, hemor￾rhage due to renal AMLs, and LAM progression [1,6].
Everolimus could have the potential to provide targeted
treatment for the entire spectrum of TSC-related manifes￾tations, reducing the risk of life-threatening complications.
However, drug therapy can not replace at all surgery
nor other therapeutic options, and every clinical choice
should be carefully tailored on the single patient taking
into account the risks and benefits of current treatment
options. mTOR inhibitors may be recommended when
asymptomatic SEGA is observed to be growing in two
subsequent MRI evaluations, or even as initial treatment
to facilitate subsequent surgery in patients with bilateral
lesions [7]. The pharmacotherapy with mTOR inhibitors
may replace surgery when SEGAs present an atypical
localization, exhibit aggressive growth, or after a re￾growth in case the second surgery is associated with a
higher risk of complications. Furthermore, the concomi￾tant presence of a growing AML and of intractable sei￾zures should be taken into account when clinicians are
making decisions between the two treatment options
for an individual patient [38].
In general, mTOR inhibitors are well tolerated. The
majority of adverse events are linked to the immunosup￾pressive action of this drug class, and include aphthous
ulcers, fever, fatigue, rash, mucositis, loss of appetite,
gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhea and nausea,
arthralgias, thrombocytopenia, and effects on lipid me￾tabolism [8]. In most cases, these AEs are self-limiting
and can be managed by dose reductions or specific
symptomatic therapy, discontinuation of treatment is
not usually necessary [39]. Potentially serious AEs may
include upper respiratory tract infections as well as
non-infective pneumonitis and dramatic elevations in
serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, which may
require dietary adjustment or the use of cholesterol￾lowering medication [8]. Apparently a definite indica￾tion on the most safe therapeutic dosage of Everolimus
is still lacking. Most of the recent studies used it at the
dosage able to determine a serum concentration of 3–5
up to 15 ng/ml [8,26], but more clinical experience is
needed to clarify this issue, especially in early childhood.
One of the still open clinical questions regards the
optimal timing for starting treatment with Everolimus.
When considering the best treatment option for young
children, the potential adverse events of a long-term
pharmacotherapy with these immunosuppressant agents
must be always taken into account. The positive effects
that mTOR inhibition have on a wide variety of TSC
disease manifestations make this a potential systemic
treatment option for this genetic multifaceted disorder.
Further studies are needed to clarify the long-term clinical
efficacy, the optimal dosage regimen in order to better
define the role of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of
TSC related manifestations.
