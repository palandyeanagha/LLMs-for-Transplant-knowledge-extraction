ABSTRACT
Objectives To assess the incidence of and risks for
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,
pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities among
adult survivors of childhood and adolescent cancers.
Design Retrospective cohort study.
Setting 26 institutions that participated in the Childhood
Cancer Survivor Study.
Participants 14 358 five year survivors of cancer
diagnosed under the age of 21 with leukaemia, brain
cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
kidney cancer, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or
bone cancer between 1970 and 1986. Comparison group
included 3899 siblings of cancer survivors.
Main outcome measures Participants or their parents (in
participants aged less than 18 years) completed a
questionnaire collecting information on demographic
characteristics, height, weight, health habits, medical
conditions, and surgical procedures occurring since
diagnosis. The main outcome measures were the
incidence of and risk factors for congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, pericardial disease, and valvular
abnormalities in survivors of cancer compared with
siblings.
Results Survivors of cancer were significantly more likely
than siblings to report congestive heart failure (hazard
ratio (HR) 5.9, 95% confidence interval 3.4 to 9.6;
P<0.001), myocardial infarction (HR 5.0, 95% CI 2.3 to
10.4; P<0.001), pericardial disease (HR 6.3, 95% CI 3.3 to
11.9; P<0.001), or valvular abnormalities (HR 4.8, 95% CI
3.0 to 7.6; P<0.001). Exposure to 250 mg/m2 or more of
anthracyclines increased the relative hazard of
congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, and valvular
abnormalities by two to five times compared with
survivors who had not been exposed to anthracyclines.
Cardiac radiation exposure of 1500 centigray or more
increased the relative hazard of congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, pericardial disease, and valvular
abnormalities by twofold to sixfold compared to non￾irradiated survivors. The cumulative incidence of adverse
cardiac outcomes in cancer survivors continued to
increase up to 30 years after diagnosis.
Conclusion Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer
are at substantial risk for cardiovascular disease.
Healthcare professionals must be aware of these risks
when caring for this growing population.
INTRODUCTION
Therapeutic advances in paediatric oncology have led
to an increase in the number of adult survivors of child￾hood and adolescent cancers, estimated at over
270 000 in the United States.1 However, survivors of
childhood or adolescent cancer have significant long
term morbidity related to their cancer therapy.
Chronic adverse outcomes of cancer therapy include
subsequent neoplasms,2 endocrine abnormalities,3 4
and growth and developmental delays.5
Cardiac toxicity can be a considerable complication
both during and after cancer therapy, and contributes
to significant morbidity and mortality in patients trea￾ted for cancer. Cardiovascular events are the leading
non-malignant cause of death among survivors of
childhood cancers, responsible for a sevenfold higher
risk of death among such patients compared with age
matched peers.6
Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy are
known to be cardiotoxic.7 The cardiac effects of the
anthracyclines are the most studied among anti￾neoplastic agents; however, many other treatments—
such as alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, anti￾metabolites, and biological agents—are also recog￾nised to have long term cardiac sequelae.8
Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin or daunorubicin,
are among the most commonly used and most effective
chemotherapeutic agents, and have significantly con￾tributed to cancer survival rates. This class of drugs has,
however, been associated with dilated cardio￾myopathy, an asymptomatic and progressive disorder
that can develop in as many as 20% of cancer survivors
15-20 years after exposure.9-11 Radiation therapy can

as induce pericardial injury, myocardial fibrosis, dys￾rhythmias, valvular abnormalities, and premature cor￾onary artery disease.12
Few studies have investigated the risk factors for car￾diac diseases in long term cancer survivors who are
now adults.13 This study sought to assess the risk of
cardiac late effects of cancer therapy occurring five or
more years after cancer diagnosis. Using data from the
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort, we retro￾spectively assessed the incidence of and risk factors
for congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,
pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities
among adult survivors of childhood and adolescent
cancers, relative to a sibling comparison group.
METHODS
Study population and data collection
The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is an ongoing,
multi-institutional study of individuals who survived at
least five years after treatment for childhood or adoles￾cent cancer. The cohort includes individuals diag￾nosed before the age 21 years with leukaemia, brain
cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, kidney cancer, neuroblastoma, soft tissue
sarcoma, or bone cancer at one of 26 collaborating
institutions between 1 January 1970 and 31 December
1986 (see web appendix).14 The initial survey of the
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort was per￾formed in 1995-6. A follow-up questionnaire was
administered between 2000 and 2002 to confirm pre￾viously reported conditions and to add data on new
first events (n=10 367 individuals participated).
At study enrolment, data were collected on demo￾graphic characteristics, current height and weight,
and health habits, as well as medical conditions and
surgical procedures occurring since diagnosis. A par￾ent, spouse, or closest next of kin was contacted for
those survivors known to have died more than five
years after diagnosis. Study protocol and documents
were reviewed and approved by the human subjects
review committees at each participating institution.
Cardiac complications were evaluated by a series of
questions such as “Have you ever been told by a doctor
or other healthcare professional that you have, or have
had . . . congestive heart failure, a myocardial infarc￾tion, etc,” with self reported responses recorded as
“yes,” “no,” or “not sure.” Study questionnaires are
available at www.stjude.org/ccss. For affirmative
answers, participants were asked to indicate the age at
first occurrence.
We identified 20 627 eligible five year cancer survi￾vors for participation, 3063 (14.8%) of whom could not
be successfully located. Thus 17 564 were contacted, of
whom14 358 (81.8%) completed a baseline question￾naire (fig 1). Other than vital status, no significant
demographic differences were identified between par￾ticipants and non-participants. A random sample of
survivor participants was asked to nominate their near￾est age sibling to participate in a control group; 3899
(81.5%) of the eligible siblings completed a
questionnaire. Study methods and characteristics of
participants and non-participants have been reported
previously in detail. 14 15
Survivors who reported a cardiac complication and
were still alive or, when possible, proxy relatives for
dead survivors, were contacted by telephone and
asked a series of questions to document disease speci￾fics. Participants were also asked to sign and return an
authorisation form to allow medical record review.
Records were requested from the physician(s) and hos￾pitals listed for the cardiac care (not the participants’
paediatric oncologist) and returned to the Childhood
Cancer Survivor Study coordinating centre. A standar￾dised protocol was developed to validate each condi￾tion. The first 100 medical records obtained were
reviewed independently by two physicians and subse￾quent records were reviewed by only one of the two
physicians. Medical record validation of self reported
cardiac events was attempted but determined to be
unfeasible owing to inability to obtain and assure ade￾quacy of records for all events and deaths (potentially
from a cardiac event). We thus decided that it was not
feasible to use validated cardiac outcomes in an
unbiased fashion and, therefore, relied upon what a
participant (or proxy) actually reported when complet￾ing the questionnaire.16 Only the first occurrence of
each condition was reported, and only outcomes
occurring five or more years after diagnosis for survi￾vors and five or more years after birth for siblings were
included in the analysis.
For all participants who returned a signed medical
release, information concerning primary therapy was
collected from medical records, including data on initial
and relapse treatment and preparatory regimens for
stem cell transplantation (if applicable). Qualitative
information was abstracted from medical records for
42 specific chemotherapeutic drugs and quantitative
information for 22 of these agents. Anthracycline dose
(per m2
) was determined by the sum of doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, and three times the idarubicin dose.17
Mean radiation dose to the heart was estimated on
the basis of detailed dosimetry calculations performed
by physicists in the Department of Radiation Physics at
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. The dosi￾metry method is described by Stovall and colleagues.18
The complete radiation therapy record for each patient
was collected, including details of the treatment

machine, radiation energy, tumour dose, and field
locations. Treatment information was merged with
measurements of scatter dose in tissue equivalent
phantoms to estimate dose to the heart in centigray
(cGy) for each individual, regardless of primary
tumour site and target volume.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic
and treatment variables and, where appropriate, com￾pared between cancer survivors and siblings. Such
comparisons took into account intra-family correlation
between a survivor and his or her sibling by using
robust variance estimates from generalised estimating
equations.19
Cox proportional hazard models with age as the time
scale, as previously described by Yasui et al,20 were
used to compare hazards of a cardiac event in survivors
compared with siblings, with adjustments for gender,
race, household income, education, and tobacco use.
Potential within family correlation between a survivor
and his or her sibling was accounted for by the use of
sandwich variance estimates.21 Multiple imputation
methodology for event-time relations was used when
a cardiac event was reported but the participant did not
report the age at which the event occurred.22 23 Age at
first cardiac condition was imputed for 9% and 14% of
survivors and siblings, respectively, who reported a
specific condition (only age at diagnosis of valvular
abnormalities was imputed for siblings).
An adjusted multivariable model that included risk
factors such as gender, age at diagnosis, treatment era
(in five year increments between 1970 and 1986), car￾diac radiation dose, and anthracycline dose was
constructed to evaluate the independent effects of
each factor on each cardiac outcome among survivors.
Other chemotherapy agents were included in the mul￾tivariable models if they had a P value of less than 0.2 in
univariate analysis. Sensitivity analyses were carried
out among patients for whom reported age at onset of
cardiac condition was available. All qualitative conclu￾sions, as well as nearly all quantitative results, were
within tight agreement with the results of the multiple
imputation analyses (data not shown). Two sided P
values are reported and those of less than 0.05 were
considered significant, although those between 0.01
and 0.05 should be interpreted as less conclusive
owing to the large number of statistical comparisons
carried out.
RESULTS
Characteristics of cancer survivors and the sibling
comparison group are shown in table 1. Among the
14 358 survivors of cancer, 7713 (53.7%) were male.
Median age at diagnosis was 6.0 years (range
0-20 years), with 40% of participants under 5 years of
age at diagnosis. Survivors were younger than siblings
at the time of completing the most recent questionnaire
(median 27.0 (8-51) years v 28.0 (3-56) years; P<0.001).
More than half of all survivors received a combination
of chemotherapy and radiation (table 2). Eleven percent
received radiation and surgery alone and 18% received
chemotherapy and surgery only, whereas a small pro￾portion (0.3%) received only radiation therapy.
The prevalence and rate of first occurrence of car￾diac conditions are shown in table 3. Overall, the fre￾quency of events among five year survivors of cancer
was relatively low, yet excessive compared with the
frequency in the sibling comparison group. Congestive
heart failure had the highest prevalence in survivors
(248 (1.7%) v 7 (0.2%) among siblings), followed by
valvular abnormalities (238 (1.6%) v 21 (0.5%)) and
pericardial disease (181 (1.3%) v 13 (0.3%)). Age
adjusted rates per 10 000 person years for congestive
heart failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial dis￾ease, and valvular abnormalities among survivors
were 9.7 (95% CI 9.4 to 10.1), 2.8 (2.4 to 3.3), 5.8 (5.4
to 6.4), and 6.4 (5.9 to 7.1), respectively. There were
not sufficient events among siblings to accurately pre￾dict age dependent rates of cardiac disorders. Among
survivors reporting a cardiac event, 146 (25%)
reported more than one event. On the other hand,
only four (10%) siblings reported more than one
event. In survivors, the median age of onset of conges￾tive heart failure was 25 years (range 7-50), myocardial
infarction 30 years (range 11-44), pericardial disease
26 years (range 6-50), and valvular abnormalities
29 years (range 7-50). In the sibling group, median
age of onset was 31 years (range 15-35), 31 years
(range 18-40), 30 years (range 9-51), and 20 years
(range 5-43) for congestive heart failure, myocardial
infarction, pericardial disease, and valvular abnormal￾ities, respectively.
The cumulative incidence of reported adverse car￾diac events increased with time from diagnosis (fig 2).

There was no plateau in this relation, with the possible
exception of myocardial infarction. The incidence at
30 years after diagnosis was highest for congestive
heart failure at 4.1% (95% CI 3.2 to 5.0%), followed by
valvular abnormalities at 4.0% (95% CI 3.1 to 4.9%) and
pericardial disease at 3.0% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.9%).
After adjustment for demographic factors, educa￾tion, household income, and smoking status, the risk
of an adverse cardiac event among survivors of child￾hood cancer was fivefold to sixfold higher than that in
the siblings (table 4). The highest relative hazard was
for pericardial disease (hazard ratio (HR) 6.3, 95% CI
3.3 to 11.9). The relative hazard of congestive heart
failure was six times that found among the siblings
and the relative hazard of myocardial infarction was
five times higher (HR 5.9, 95% CI 3.4 to 9.6 and HR
5.0, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.4, respectively).
Compared with the sibling cohort, the hazard for
congestive heart failure was significantly elevated in
survivors across all diagnoses, in particular Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (HR 6.8, 95% CI 3.9 to 11.7) and bone can￾cer (HR 6.5, 95% CI 3.6 to 12.0; table 3) The relative
hazard of myocardial infarction was highest among
survivors of Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HR 12.2, 95% CI
5.2 to 28.2) and neuroblastoma (HR 11.1, 95% CI 3.3
to 36.9) and lowest among those who had leukaemia
(HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.6). Survivors of leukaemia,
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and bone can￾cer had a significantly elevated hazard for each of the
cardiac outcomes analysed.
An adjusted multivariable model was constructed to
evaluate the independent effects on cardiac outcomes
among survivors of the following risk factors: gender,
age at diagnosis, treatment era, cardiac radiation expo￾sure, anthracycline dose, and exposure to other che￾motherapy agents (table 5).
Significant risk factors for congestive heart failure
included female gender, age less than 10 years at diag￾nosis, treatment during the 1980s, increasing anthracy￾cline exposure, and radiation exposure above 1500
cGy. An association with exposure to cisplatin was sug￾gested, but this relation did not reach statistical signifi￾cance (P=0.06). For myocardial infarction, female
gender was protective, and age at diagnosis and anthra￾cycline dose were not significantly associated with an
increased risk. However, radiation doses of 3500 cGy
or more were significantly associated with myocardial
infarction (P for trend <0.001). Pericardial disease was
not associated with gender or age at diagnosis, but was
significantly associated with increasing doses of car￾diac radiation, exposure to an anthracycline dose of
250 mg/m2 or more, and exposure to any dose of cyclo￾phosphamide. An association with bleomycin was sug￾gested but was not statistically significant (P=0.09).
Females were more likely than males to report valvular
dysfunction, which was associated with age at diagno￾sis of 14 years or less, treatment in the 1980s, higher
doses of radiation therapy, and exposure to an anthra￾cycline dose of 250 mg/m2 or more (table 4).
Cumulative incidence curves illustrate the
dose-response relationship between anthracycline

DISCUSSION
Principal findings of the study
Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in
the developed world,24 contributes to early morbidity
and mortality among cancer survivors. Using data
from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort,
we performed the largest analysis to date of cardio￾vascular disease among adult survivors of childhood
and adolescent cancers. We found significantly
increased risks for congestive heart failure, myocardial
infarction, pericardial disease, and valvular dysfunc￾tion among adult cancer survivors compared with a
sibling control group. Previous research has shown
the excess cardiovascular mortality in this cohort6
;
this study illustrates the risk of reported cardiovascular
disease rather than mortality.
Cardiac events, generally rare in young adults, were
significantly more frequent in young survivors of can￾cer than in siblings. At a mean age of 27 years, 248
survivors reported congestive heart failure and 101
had experienced a myocardial infarction. The inci￾dence of each cardiovascular outcome increased with
time from diagnosis, which suggests that the long term
impact of treatment on the health of cancer survivors
will be substantial. The relative hazard of a survivor
reporting cardiovascular disease was higher than that
in the sibling group across most diagnoses and was sig￾nificantly associated with specific therapeutic expo￾sures, notably exposure to anthracyclines or a cardiac
radiation dose of more than 1500 cGy.
Comparison with other studies
Most studies of cardiovascular outcomes among survi￾vors of childhood cancer have concentrated on a lim￾ited number of diagnoses (that is, leukaemia,
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Wilms’s tumour, and bone
tumour)25-28 or a particular dose of radiation.29 30 Only
a few single institution studies have included a range of
diagnoses similar to ours and fewer have included such
a broad range of cardiovascular outcomes.31-34
Congestive heart failure
In our study, the relative hazard of congestive heart
failure was increased for all diagnostic groups com￾pared with the sibling control group. Among survi￾vors, the risk was associated with female gender, age
less than 10 years at diagnosis, treatment during the
1980s, and higher radiation therapy and anthracycline

survivors. This finding is consistent with other reports,
although the reason for this gender difference is
unclear.
These findings are similar to those in previous reports.
Anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy has been noted
followingtreatmentfor a variety ofmalignancies and can
occur after any dose.11 35 Steinherz and colleagues
reported that 23% of long term survivors of paediatric
malignancies who had received chemotherapy had
cardiovascular disease 20 years later; a total of 11%
had congestive heart failure following anthracycline
doses of less than 400 mg/m2 and 100% had the heart
disorder at doses of more than 800 mg/m2
.
9 In addition,
the risk increases with time and higher cumulative expo￾sures. For example, in a study of over 600 childhood
cancer survivors, Kremer and colleagues found an ele￾vated risk of anthracycline induced heart failure among
those who had received a cumulative dose of more than
300 mg/m2
, which increased over 15 years.31 In our
cohort, the relative hazard of congestive heart failure
associated with anthracycline treatment was 2.4-fold
higher at doses of less than 250 mg/m2 and 5.2-fold
higher at doses of 250 mg/m2 or more, compared with
individuals who had not been exposedto anthracyclines.
We also found a potential association between con￾gestive heart failure and cisplatin exposure. This rela￾tion has been reported previously and is thought to be
related to multiagent chemotherapy.36
The 30 year cumulative incidence of congestive
heart failure in the entire cohort was 4.1% (95% CI
3.2 to 5.0). This is lower than in other reports but
includes all diagnostic groups in the Childhood Cancer
Survivor Study and all anthracycline and radiation
therapy dose levels. Notably, the congestive heart fail￾ure incidence curve does not seem to plateau and accel￾erates markedly as childhood cancer survivors enter
adulthood.
Therapy induced cardiomyopathy can be asympto￾matic in over 50% of cancer survivors,10 yet is detect￾able with non-invasive cardiac testing.37 Cardiac
failure may become apparent only with a physiologic
stress such as infection or pregnancy.38 39 Subclinical
disease could not be assessed in this analysis, thus the
true frequency and risk of cardiac dysfunction may
actually be higher. Optimal therapy for chemotherapy
induced congestive heart failure has been extrapolated
from therapies used for cardiac disease caused by other
factors and, thus far, has shown only limited benefit.40

The development of new cardioprotective agents and
preventive measures may help ameliorate this risk in
the future.41
Myocardial infarction
Ischaemic heart disease after childhood cancer therapy
has been less extensively studied; however, to some
extent previous studies and our study have suggested
that the risk of ischaemic heart disease may become
more apparent with longer follow-up. Most studies of
myocardial infarction among cancer survivors have
focused on survivors of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and
other studies frequently combine paediatric and adult
patients. Hancock and colleagues specifically evalu￾ated survivors of childhood and adolescent Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and reported a 30-fold increase in the risk
of cardiac death and 41-fold increase in death related to
myocardial infarction in this cohort compared with the
age matched general population.42 Deaths occurred
3-22 years from commencement of therapy among
those patients treated with more than 4200 cGy med￾iastinal radiation. Reinders et al. reported 31 (12%)
ischaemic events and 12 (4.7%) deaths among 258
survivors of paediatric or adult Hodgkin’s lymphoma;
these events occurred a median of 11.8 years after treat￾ment and with a mean radiation therapy dose of 3660
cGy.43 Male gender, increasing age, and pretreatment
cardiac history were significant predictors of ischaemic
heart disease in this study. The relative risk of hospital
admission for myocardial infarction was 2.7 (95% CI
1.7 to 4.0) and the standardised mortality ratio was 5.3
(95% CI 2.7 to 9.3). King and colleagues did not iden￾tify a significantly elevated relative risk of morbid car￾diac events among 326 patients with Hodgkin’s
lymphoma treated with radiation therapy (mean man￾tle radiation dose 4430 cGy) but reported 14 (4.3%)
myocardial infarctions, seven (2.1%) of which were
fatal.44 The risk tended to be higher for patients treated
when they were under 21 years of age.
Our study evaluated the relative hazard of first myo￾cardial infarction, rather than death, in five year survi￾vors of childhood and adolescent cancer, and generally
found the risks comparable with those reported by
others. The highest risks were among survivors of
Hodgkin’s lymphoma or neuroblastoma, and the risk
was negligible among survivors of non-Hodgkin’s

lymphoma. However, a risk of myocardial infarction
was noted with much lower doses of radiation therapy
than those covered in other reports. Our study
included a variety of diagnoses instead of just Hodg￾kin’s lymphoma, assessed survivors five years after
diagnosis or later, and had a longer follow-up (mean
20 years) than most other studies. The long follow-up
time in our study may account for the observed
increased risk of myocardial infarction in cancer survi￾vors heavily exposed to a variety of cardiotoxic agents
such as anthracyclines, cisplatin, and radiation ther￾apy. Only the study by Aleman et al. had a similar
length follow-up (18 years); this group reported a
3.6-fold higher risk of myocardial infarction among
five year survivors of Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared
with the general population.45 Hancock and collea￾gues’ study suggested an early latency for fatal ischae￾mic disease after high dose radiation therapy (4000-
4500 cGy) in survivors of Hodgkin’s lymphoma.42
Our data suggest that even low doses of radiation ther￾apy (1500-3500 cGy) can cause damage to the coron￾ary circulation, which may only become apparent with
prolonged follow-up. Although platinum containing
regimens have also been associated with ischaemic dis￾ease among survivors of testicular cancer,46 we did not
identify an association between myocardial infarction
and cisplatin.
Survivors of neuroblastoma in our study had a nota￾ble 11-fold increased relative hazard of myocardial
infarction. Most reports of late complications in
survivors of neuroblastoma have concentrated on
neurosensory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal abnorm￾alities. Few studies have reported cardiovascular
abnormalities in this population, other than a study
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center that
identified five survivors of advanced stage neuroblas￾toma with cardiac disease among a cohort of 63
patients.47
Pericardial disease
Our study demonstrates a threefold to 10-fold higher
relative hazard of pericardial disease in cancer survi￾vors compared with sibling controls across all types
of cancers examined, with the exception of kidney can￾cer. Additionally, the 30 year incidence of pericardial
disease for survivors in all diagnostic groups was 3.0%
(95% CI 2.1 to 3.9).
Acute pericardial injury following cancer therapy
has been reported previously; however, studies exam￾ining pericardial abnormalities among cancer survi￾vors five or more years after diagnosis are
uncommon. Many of the published studies focus on
patients with adult Hodgkin’s lymphoma and assess
radiation related pericardial disease or subacute injury
occurring within a few years of therapy.48-50 One study
in survivors of childhood or adolescent Hodgkin’s
lymphoma found a 4% risk for pericardiectomy
17 years after therapy.42
Valvular abnormalities
Our analysis included many different cancer diagnoses
and found a nearly fivefold higher relative hazard of
valvular abnormalities in survivors of cancer than in
the sibling control group, as well as an association
between valvular disease and higher doses of anthra￾cyclines.
Again, most previous studies have focused on survi￾vors of Hodgkin’s lymphoma who were diagnosed as
adults. Valvular dysfunction may be a fairly common
late complication of radiation therapy to the chest.51

One study showed that 6.2% of survivors of Hodgkin’s
lymphoma developed clinically significant valvular
abnormalities at a median of 22 years after
diagnosis.12 A screening study in asymptomatic cancer
survivors who had received at least 3500 cGy of mantle
radiation suggested that up to 60% would present with
some type of valvular disease.52 Another study of
Hodgkin’s lymphoma survivors younger than
41 years of age at treatment found a sevenfold
increased risk of valvular abnormalities associated
with mantle radiation and a twofold increased risk
associated with anthracycline therapy.45
Strengths and limitations of the study
Some aspects of this research need to be considered
when interpreting the findings of our study. The large
survivor population in the Childhood Cancer Survivor
Study, which is well characterised with regard to can￾cer and treatment exposures, provides an excellent
resource for studying clinically diagnosed outcomes.
The large size and broad geographic distribution of
the cohort does, however, necessitate reliance on self
reported outcomes and makes validation of negative
responses impractical.
We attempted to validate all positively reported out￾comes by either telephone contact or medical record
review, but determined that it was not feasible to obtain
the appropriate documentation from a sufficiently high
proportion of the cases. The key difficulty was that vali￾dation was only possible in a relatively small subset of
the population who actually reported an event. For
example, in a sample of 292 survivors reporting con￾gestive heart failure at any time after diagnosis, only
189 (65%) could be contacted for a telephone inter￾view. We could obtain relevant cardiac medical
records for only 103 of these participants (35% of
292; 54% of 189), and 25 (24%) of these records did
not contain adequate information to determine cardiac
disease status. Furthermore, 64% of those participants
we could not validate by telephone interview had died
compared with 14% of those validated by telephone
interview (via proxy). In addition, it is likely that a rela￾tively high proportion of individuals who self reported
a cardiac event on the Childhood Cancer Survivor
Study surveys and subsequently died would have had
a confirmed cardiac event had they lived long enough,
owing to the high mortality rate from these conditions.
Relying on death certificates for confirmation of cause
of death adds additional variability. Epidemiologic stu￾dies have shown death certificate data to have limited
reliability and accuracy.53 54 Thus, the accuracy of self
reported cardiac outcomes reflects an area of potential
concern. On the other hand, the validity of self
reported long term events among cancer survivors
has been found to be generally high, with 83% sensitiv￾ity and 98% specificity for myocardial infarction.55
Another issue of concern is the potential for surveil￾lance bias, given that a proportion of the study popula￾tion had been exposed to known cardiotoxic
substances and thus may have been under greater med￾ical monitoring. Such bias would overestimate the risk
of adverse cardiac outcomes. Previous reports, how￾ever, have found a poor knowledge of and little appro￾priate screening for late effects of treatment among
survivors of childhood cancer.56 57
Other than gender and smoking status, details on
traditional Framingham risk factors were not available
for our cohort. Framingham risk factors were identified
in a population older than ours and are thought to take
years to affect cardiovascular health. Hypertension
and dyslipidaemia may have developed over time in
our population, but the participants’ blood pressure
and lipid status at entry to the cohort is unknown. Sur￾veillance for Framingham risk factors may be of
increased importance in a population exposed to che￾motherapy or radiation therapy early in life because of
the additional risks these chemotherapy/radiation
therapy exposed patients have as they become adults
and enter an age group where Framingham risk factors
apply and cardiovascular disease is more prevalent.
Another potential limitation to be considered is the
fact that the proportion of deaths among eligible indi￾viduals who were lost to follow-up or refused to parti￾cipate is higher than that in those who were study
participants (18% v 12%). This finding raises the possi￾bility that more of the non-participating individuals
than the participating individuals had a fatal cardiac
condition, which could mean that our study underesti￾mates the true incidence of cardiac conditions in this
population. However, the proportion of individuals
with death attributed to a cardiac cause on death certi￾ficate did not differ between participants and non-par￾ticipants (0.8% v 0.6%, respectively), providing some
reassurance that this may not be the case.
Conclusions and further research
We found a significant incidence of cardiovascular
complications among adult survivors of a variety of
childhood and adolescent cancers years after treat￾ment. This research confirms in the largest cohort of
childhood and adolescent cancer survivors in the
world previous reports of adverse cardiac outcomes
after cancer treatment and identifies several new risk
factors. Young adults who survive childhood or ado￾lescent cancer are clearly at risk for early cardiac mor￾bidity and mortality not typically recognised within
this age group. Such individuals require ongoing
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Survivors of childhood cancer have significant long term morbidity related to their cancer
therapy
Cardiovascular events are the leading non-malignant cause of death among survivors of
childhood and adolescent cancers
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Young adult survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for a variety of adverse cardiovascular
outcomes—such as congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial disease, and
valvular abnormalities—as late as 30 years after therapy
This risk is apparent at lower exposures to anthracyclines and radiation therapy than
previously recognised
