Abstract
Asthma is an increasing global health burden, especially in the western world. Public health
interventions are sought to lessen its prevalence or severity, and diet and nutrition have been
identified as potential factors. With rapid changes in diet being one of the hallmarks of
westernization, nutrition may play a key role in affecting the complex genetics and developmental
pathophysiology of asthma. The present review investigates hypotheses about hygiene,
antioxidants, lipids and other nutrients, food types and dietary patterns, breastfeeding, probiotics
and intestinal microbiota, vitamin D, maternal diet, and genetics. Early hypotheses analyzed
population level trends and focused on major dietary factors such as antioxidants and lipids. More
recently, larger dietary patterns beyond individual nutrients have been investigated such as obesity,
fast foods, and the Mediterranean diet. Despite some promising hypotheses and findings, there has
been no conclusive evidence about the role of specific nutrients, food types, or dietary patterns
past early childhood on asthma prevalence. However, diet has been linked to the development of
the fetus and child. Breastfeeding provides immunological protection when the infant's immune
system is immature and a modest protective effect against wheeze in early childhood. Moreover,
maternal diet may be a significant factor in the development of the fetal airway and immune system.
As asthma is a complex disease of gene-environment interactions, maternal diet may play an
epigenetic role in sensitizing fetal airways to respond abnormally to environmental insults. Recent
hypotheses show promise in a biological approach in which the effects of dietary factors on
individual physiology and immunology are analyzed before expansion into larger population studies.
Thus, collaboration is required by various groups in studying this enigma from epidemiologists to
geneticists to immunologists. It is now apparent that this multidisciplinary approach is required to
move forward and understand the complexity of the interaction of dietary factors and asthma.
Introduction
Asthma, particularly among children, has grown in preva￾lence and as a worldwide public health burden [1], but
has been an elusive target for public health interventions.
Dietary factors have been a focus at both the cellular and
population levels, and several theories have been pro￾posed or abandoned, though no clear answer has emerged
[2-12]. This review highlights the development of major
promising hypotheses about diet and asthma and possi￾ble paths for future investigation.

Nature to nurture
Asthma is an allergic disease of complex gene-environ￾ment interactions [13-15]. Twin studies show that over
70% of the variation in asthmatic tendency is explained
by genetic factors, and several contributing genes have
been identified [16,17]. However, individual genes have
been ineffective in altering the expression of asthma, indi￾cating the necessity of environmental factors [14]. Rapid
increases in worldwide asthma prevalence in only the past
couple decades, especially in westernized countries, signal
an important role of the environment [12].
It is known that environmental factors affect gene expres￾sion and manifestation of disease. Early fetal exposures to
nutrition and other environmental factors may program
organ development and future development of disease.
For example, severe fetal malnutrition has been linked to
increased risk for health problems in adulthood [18].
Thus, nutrition and diet may be important to the develop￾ment of asthma through epigenetic effects. With rapid
changes in diet as a hallmark of westernization, dietary
factors may indeed play a key role in affecting the complex
genetics and developmental pathophysiology of asthma.
Early dietary hypotheses
It is important to look back on the progression of dietary
studies over the years to see how theories have evolved
and adapted as new evidence has been brought forth and
new ideas proposed.
Hygiene hypothesis
Increased westernization and the correlated rise in asthma
prevalence have prompted investigation of environmental
factors related to westernization. One of the earliest theo￾ries became known as the "hygiene hypothesis," which
suggested that increasing "cleanliness" and lack of expo￾sure to infections at a critical point in the development of
the immune system may lead to an increased risk of
asthma and other atopic diseases [19]. This hypothesis
has not been well supported by evidence, such as an
increase of asthma in North and South American inner cit￾ies that are generally characterized by poor housing and a
dirty environment [12,20,21].
Antioxidant hypothesis
Seaton et al. 1994 hypothesized that alteration in diet
associated with westernization may be responsible for the
increase in asthma prevalence [22]. Observations showed
that consumption of foods rich in antioxidants had
decreased in the United Kingdom diet while asthma prev￾alence rose. Thus the promising hypothesis was put forth
that populations had become more susceptible to respira￾tory disease due to dietary antioxidant omission.
Antioxidant studies have focused on vitamin C, vitamin E,
carotenoids, flavonoids, and antioxidant nutrients such as
selenium and zinc. A wide range of cross-sectional studies
has been done on the relationship of antioxidants with
asthma. Vitamin C, β-carotene, magnesium, and selenium
were associated with reduction in asthma prevalence [23-
27], and may prevent or limit an inflammatory response
in the airways by reducing reactive oxygen species and
inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Flavonoids may also be
potential anti-allergic substances [28], and a recent study
on enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems in
childhood asthma suggested that antioxidant defenses
such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase
were lowered in asthmatic children [29].
However, not all studies on the role of antioxidants have
been positive. A meta-analysis determined that dietary
intake of antioxidants vitamins C and E and β-carotene
does not significantly influence the risk of asthma [30].
Furthermore, many studies have shown no association
between selenium and asthma [31]. However, these
results may still have significance in light of biological
studies that show that selenium acts as an antioxidant but
can also upregulate immune responses that characterize
allergic asthma – a more complex effect that cannot be
explained just by case-control studies [32]. The potential
role of antioxidants as supplements has been explored
[33], but a number of studies have been inconclusive [34].
Overall, supplementation studies have suggested a minor
role for individual antioxidants in asthma prevention [4],
perhaps working in larger food groups instead – the
source of Seaton's original study.
Lipid hypothesis
In 1997, Black and Sharpe cited evidence, which contra￾dicted the antioxidant hypothesis, instead proposing that
the rise of asthma prevalence may have stemmed from
increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) and decreased consumption of saturated fat [35].
The ω-6 PUFAs may particularly have a role in regulating
immune response and inflammation. These PUFAs are
found largely as linoleic acid in foods such as margarine
and vegetable oils, which have risen in consumption with
westernization. Linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic
acid that is converted into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which
inhibits interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and promotes an inflamma￾tory environment that favors asthma development. Mean￾while, ω-3 PUFAs may have an anti-inflammatory role.
Thus, the increase in ω-6 PUFA and decrease in ω-3 PUFA
consumption may immunologically increase the suscepti￾bility of the population. PUFAs may have other immuno￾suppressive mechanisms that require further study [36].
Investigation of the lipid hypothesis found mixed results.
A number of cross-sectional studies showed beneficial

Respiratory Research 2009, 10:49 http://respiratory-research.com/content/10/1/49
Page 3 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)
associations between foods containing ω-3 PUFAs and
asthma, but studies on cord blood PUFA composition and
development of atopic disease have been inconclusive [5].
There have been conflicting reports on the relationship
between levels of PUFAs and wheeze [37,38]. Disappoint￾ingly, intervention studies have not found consistent
results nor provided sufficient support for dietary supple￾mentation with PUFAs [36,37,39-41].
Other nutrients
Other nutritional factors have recently been investigated
using various methods ranging from cohort studies to eco￾logical analyses with populations from schoolchildren to
entire nations.
A sodium hypothesis was proposed in 1987 based on a
correlation between table salt purchases and asthma mor￾tality [42]. Sodium intake could potentially exacerbate
asthma as hyper-sensitized bronchial smooth muscle
could be leaky to sodium and thus lead to hyperpolariza￾tion of the muscle in response to increased sodium intake
[43]. However, there is no clear relationship between air￾way responsiveness (a surrogate for asthma) and urinary
sodium excretion (an indicator of sodium intake) [44]. A
more recent trial, in which participants adopted a variable
sodium diet based on supplements or placebo, found no
benefit for asthma either [45].
Magnesium has been implicated through its possible
effects on bronchial smooth muscle. Low magnesium
intake has been correlated with decreased lung function in
children [46], and intravenous magnesium is recom￾mended to control acute severe asthma in many emer￾gency departments [47]. Nevertheless, due to a paucity of
studies on magnesium and asthma prevalence, its impor￾tance remains to be seen.
Food types and dietary patterns
Larger food groups have been studied as possible exam￾ples of synergy among multiple nutrients. Fruits and veg￾etables have been extensively studied as potent sources of
antioxidants. A low dietary intake of fruit was associated
with asthma in Norwich, UK [25]. Several other cross-sec￾tional studies have indicated an inverse association
between consumption of fruits and vegetables and symp￾toms of asthma, though the particular foods and symp￾toms varied [8,48-52]. Moving beyond individual country
studies, Ellwood et al. conducted an ecological analysis on
data from centers in 53 countries the International Study
of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), which not
only looked at single countries, but also compared diet
and asthma globally using asthma prevalence data from
ISAAC and dietary data from the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations [53]. Together, these
data suggested an inverse relationship between asthma
prevalence rates and intake of vegetables and foods of
plant origin such as starch and cereals. However, a smaller
study of Dutch children found no clear association
between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma symptoms
[54]. Despite the plethora of cross-sectional data about
fruits and vegetables, there is a lack of longitudinal studies
and analyses to form a causal link between these foods
and asthma prevalence.
The hypothesis of westernized diets affecting asthma prev￾alence has prompted studies of fast foods, Mediterranean
diet, and obesity as potential factors. A cross-sectional
study of children in Hastings, New Zealand showed that
hamburger consumption positively associated with
asthma symptoms while takeaway consumption had a
marginal effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness [55].
The Mediterranean diet, on the other hand, has been sug￾gested as a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk
of asthma. In fact, ISAAC data indicated lower asthma
prevalence in Mediterranean countries with diet as a pos￾sible variable to explain this disparity [1,56,57]. There is a
consistent relationship between a Mediterranean diet and
asthma symptoms [48,57,58]. But additional studies are
necessary to corroborate this association and define a pos￾sible mechanism.
Lastly, obesity is a major factor of diet that may have a role
in asthma. Its role has been controversial as, yet again, dif￾ferent studies have found contrasting results [58]. Epide￾miologic studies have suggested that asthma is more
prevalent among obese than lean individuals. It is
unclear, however, whether obesity merely exacerbates the
asthmatic symptoms, creates susceptibility to onset of
asthma, or develops concurrently with the respiratory dis￾ease. Obesity could have potential biological effects on
lung function and systematic inflammation while also
sharing certain co-morbidities and etiologies with asthma
[59]. Nevertheless, the relationship between obesity and
asthma remains an enigma despite evidence of a connec￾tion.
Overall, interesting hypotheses and some promising pos￾itive findings have made no definitive conclusions about
the role of specific nutrients, food types, or dietary pat￾terns on asthma prevalence.
Evolution of dietary hypotheses and studies
Recent work has linked diet to the development of the
fetus and child – an extrapolation from studies on other
diseases indicating an effect of early diet on later onset of
disease. This "thrifty phenotype hypothesis" argues that
poor nutrition in early life is epidemiologically associated
with poor fetal and infant growth and subsequent devel￾opment of type 2 diabetes [60]. A large body of evidence

Respiratory Research 2009, 10:49 http://respiratory-research.com/content/10/1/49
Page 4 of 7

shows that the intrauterine and early childhood environ￾ments are crucial for development of diabetes and coro￾nary heart disease, and asthma has been increasingly
included in a similar category of diseases "programmed"
in utero [61], hinting at a possible epigenetic component.
This developmental model of the origins of disease pos￾sesses a variety of subcategories that have been recently
explored for asthma from breastfeeding and intestinal
microbiota to maternal nutrition.
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding provides infants with nutrients for growth,
development, and immunological protection during a
critical period of the infant's life when its own immune
system is immature [62,63]. There are many questions
about exclusive breastfeeding over infant formula and the
optimal length of breastfeeding in asthma development.
A 2004 cohort study showed exclusive breastfeeding for
more than four months reduced the risk of asthma at the
child's age of four [64]. A separate 2008 cohort report on
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) agrees that breastfeeding has a modest protec￾tive effect against wheeze and asthma in early childhood
[65]. However, the study found that this effect did not last
beyond the sixth year of life. Despite some positive stud￾ies, others have seen an entirely converse effect [66], lead￾ing to some heated controversy about breastfeeding
recommendations [67,68].
Breastfeeding is complex in its effects on the immunolog￾ical health of the child. Regardless, not enough evidence
exists to recommend guidelines for breastfeeding for
asthma prevention.
Probiotics and intestinal microbiota
Breastfeeding is well known to modify the intestinal com￾position of commensal bacteria, which drives immune
development in the infant. For example, exclusively for￾mula-fed infants possessed more colonies of E coli, C diff￾icile, Bacteroides, and lactobacilli compared to breastfed
infants [69]. Instead, breastfed infants had the most
potentially beneficial intestinal microbiota. The human
gastrointestinal tract is sterile at birth, rapidly undergoing
colonization of the gut with subsequent development of
the immune system. Studies have shown that there are
obvious differences in the composition of intestinal
microbiota between healthy and allergic infants within
the first week of life and before clinical symptoms for the
latter group, suggesting that modifying microbiota com￾position may affect disease outcome [70].
Probiotics are dietary supplements that contain beneficial
bacteria such as Lactobacillus GG and may be effective in
preventing early atopy in children through the modula￾tion of intestinal microbiota [71]. Probiotics may enhance
IgA responses in the gut as well as regulate inflammatory
cytokines, both immunomodulatory effects that could
prevent progression of atopy and potentially develop￾ment of disease. Further study, possibly large-scale birth
cohort analyses using molecular methods to test for
microbiota [72], is required before any recommendations
can be given about probiotic administration for asthma
prevention.
Vitamin D
Recently, Litonjua and Weiss hypothesized that vitamin D
deficiency can increase the incidence of asthma in young
children [73,74]. This idea stemmed from the discovery
that the vitamin D receptor gene was associated with
asthma [75]. (Albeit, more genetic work is necessary to
clarify this since vitamin D receptor knockout mice do not
develop the murine model for asthma [76].) Vitamin D
does not occur naturally in humans and is acquired
through supplements and exposure to sunlight. The rise of
asthma in westernized countries may be linked to the fact
that people spend much more time indoors and away
from sunlight. Furthermore, vitamin D has significant
immunomodulatory functions through control of T regu￾latory cells, which modulate levels of CD4+ helper T cells.
Vitamin D receptors have been identified in various
immune cells from T cells to dendritic cells that have a
potential role in asthma pathogenesis.
Observational studies in the United States and the UK
have reported that maternal intake of vitamin D during
pregnancy was associated with lung function, suggesting
that increased vitamin D in maternal diet may reduce risk
of wheeze and other symptoms of asthma [77,78]. As with
other hypotheses, supplementation studies are necessary,
especially in pregnancy.
Maternal diet hypothesis
Extending the "thrifty phenotype hypothesis" by Barker et
al [79,80], maternal nutrition has been recognized as a
potential (and potent) factor in the development of the
fetal airway and immune system. Nutrients during preg￾nancy may affect T helper cell differentiation toward a Th2
bias through cytokine regulation and promote normal air￾way formation in the fetus [3].
With the prospect that diet during pregnancy may be more
important than at any other point in life, many nutrients
such as antioxidants and lipids have been tested. In 2002,
Devereux et al found that increased maternal intake of
vitamin E was associated with decreased proliferation of
cord blood mononuclear cells in response to allergens,
suggesting a beneficial effect of maternal nutrition against
atopy [81]. Two separate maternal antioxidant studies
showed an inverse relationship of antioxidants vitamin E,
vitamin C, and zinc with wheeze [82,83]. The selenium

status of a cohort of two thousand pregnant mothers was
also inversely associated with wheezing in the child [84],
but this disappeared after the age of five years. While these
results indicate a possible role of maternal intake of cer￾tain antioxidants, more studies are necessary to confirm
this. Studying the effects of maternal PUFA intake has
been sparser, largely tested through analysis of maternal
fish consumption. One such study found that maternal
oily fish consumption during pregnancy was protective
for childhood asthma, particularly in children who have
asthmatic mothers [85]. In keeping with many other diet
studies, however, a longitudinal study of maternal con￾sumption of various food types found no association
between fish intake and asthma outcomes in children
[86]. There was also no association between asthma and
maternal consumption of foods such as vegetables, egg,
and dairy. In contrast to the more specific antioxidant and
vitamin D studies, the effect of broader food groups on
asthma outcomes seems less significant [87].
There is an obvious need for more intervention studies on
dietary supplementation using nutrients and factors that
have potential to impact the intrauterine environment
and fetal immune and lung development [88]. Further
understanding of dietary immunomodulation of the preg￾nant uterus is necessary [41]. With exciting developments
elucidating the relationship between the in utero environ￾ment and subsequent onset of complex diseases, there is
further motivation to explore the impact of diet on fetal
development and risk of asthma.
Conclusion: the road ahead
Asthma is complex: comprised of a heterogeneous variety
of diseases, initiated by disparate genetic and environ￾mental factors, and unified by common symptoms such
as airway constriction and wheeze [89]. Diet could mod￾ulate epigenetics, intestinal microbiota, physiological
development, airway remodeling, and immune matura￾tion – factors highly relevant to the etiology of asthma. Yet
the literature on diet and asthma is "fragmentary and hard
to summarize in a systematic way and difficulties with
many small studies leave unexplained contradictions in
the literature" [10].
Such complexity makes for a daunting task of identifying
pathways for future intervention. Evidence for nutrient
supplementation after early childhood to support any pri￾mary prevention is weak. A greater understanding of
maternal diet is necessary, particularly for antioxidants
and vitamin D, perhaps by supplementing pregnant
mothers with vitamin D and following their children
through childhood [73]. Additionally, mechanistic stud￾ies are needed through gene expression and association
studies. Explaining the downstream effects of vitamin D
on infant physiology and immunology is crucial to vetting
vitamin D as a possible intervention. One novel approach
may be through genetic epidemiology using DNA col￾lected from cohorts to analyze the effect of a modifiable
factor by measuring variations in relevant genes [90].
Lastly, more extensive animal studies are necessary. There
have been many diet-related studies using murine models
of asthma. Admittedly, such models are relatively weak.
Nevertheless, discoveries in a controlled animal model
environment have advantages over the epidemiological
approach in pursuing specific modalities [28,91,92].
Historically, studies have started from a population level
formed from trends seen at the macro level with molecu￾lar mechanisms generally analyzed afterwards. With vita￾min D [73] and maternal diet [3,80], there is a subtle but
important difference in approach: mechanistic hypothe￾ses at the micro level are now being expanded into larger
clinical and population-based studies. Though it is still
too early to determine if such an approach is beneficial,
early indications are promising.
On the road ahead, if hypotheses are to be derived from
the micro level, there is need for more collaboration
amongst various groups from epidemiologists to geneti￾cists to immunologists. As we look back and move for￾wards, a multidisciplinary approach is increasingly
necessary to understand the complexity of dietary factors
and asthma.
