Abstract
Background: The association between sarcopenia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly people has not been
adequately assessed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CVD is more prevalent in subjects with sarcopenia
independent of other well-established cardiovascular risk factors in older Korean adults.
Method: This study utilized the representative Korean population data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (KNHANES) which was conducted in 2009. Subjects older than 65 years of age with appendicular
skeletal muscle mass (ASM) determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were selected. The prevalence of sarcopenia in
the older Korean adults was investigated, and it was determined whether sarcopenia is associated with CVD independent of
other well-known risk factors.
Results: 1,578 subjects aged 65 years and older with the data for ASM were selected, and the overall prevalence of
sarcopenia was 30.3% in men and 29.3% in women. Most of the risk factors for CVD such as age, waist circumference, body
mass index, fasting plasma glucose and total cholesterol showed significant negative correlations with the ratio between
appendicular skeletal muscle mass and body weight. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that sarcopenia was
associated with CVD independent of other well-documented risk factors, renal function and medications (OR, 1.768; 95% CI,
1.075–2.909, P = 0.025).
Conclusions: Sarcopenia was associated with the presence of CVD independent of other cardiovascular risk factors after
adjusting renal function and medications.

Introduction
Sarcopenia refers to the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength
that occurs with normal aging and may be of great importance, as
it can lead to disability and chronic complications [1,2]. Its
prevalence varies between 7 to 24% [3–8], possibly due to the
absence of an accepted definition of sarcopenia necessary for
research and clinical purposes as well as heterogeneous study
populations.
Sarcopenia is believed to be a part of the ageing process [9].
With fat infiltration deposited within muscle fibers [10], a loss of
motor units as well as atrophy of the type II fast glycolytic fibers is
known to accelerate the development of sarcopenia, and as a
consequence, muscle power necessary for daily life is gradually lost
and physical activity decreases [11]. In addition, chronic
inflammation and catabolic cytokine production have been also
reported to play significant roles in the development of sarcopenia
[12]. All of these processes are highly linked to its detrimental
metabolic effects causing a higher prevalence of chronic diseases
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia and
hypertension (HTN) [13] which are well-known risk factors for
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
However, there have been few studies examining the relation￾ship between sarcopenia and CVD, and the results are conflicting
[14–19]. A Japanese study demonstrated that sarcopenia was
significantly associated with greater arterial stiffness especially in
women, which did not directly analyze between sarcopenia and
CVD [14]. Also, the similar result was found when muscle mass
was indirectly measured using 24 h urinary creatinine excretion
rates instead of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [18,19].

On the other hand, Aubertin-Leheudre et al., found that
sarcopenia was associated with lower risk factors predisposing to
CVD but their study populations had very unique features such as
including only postmenopausal women [15]. Sarcopenia with
combined obesity was reported not to be associated higher risk of
functional limitation in older patients, but in this study muscle
mass was estimated by using the predicted equation [16], thus
making their results not easily generalizable or clinically useful.
Considering the absence of appropriate and consistent evidence
regarding the association between sarcopenia and CVD, the aim
of the present study was to determine whether or not sarcopenia is
associated with CVD independent of other well-established CVD
risk factors in Korean adults over 65 years old based upon data
from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (KNHANES) IV, which was conducted in 2009.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong (approval number
KHNMC 2012–128). When KNHANES IV was conducted, all of
the participants were informed that they had been randomly
chosen to participate in the survey with the right to refuse to
participate in the further analyses, and signed informed consents.
KNHANES IV
KNHANES is a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional
health survey. As of its first survey in 1998, KNHANES IV was
performed between July 2007 and December 2009, which used a
randomized selection method choosing from all households
recorded in the Population and Housing Census in Korea in
2005. The entire nation was divided into 29 ranks based upon
administrative districts and housing types. Two hundred districts
from each rank were randomized by applying proportional
allocation to equalize the distribution ratio between the entire
population and the samples within each rank. One survey section
from each district was selected based upon the characteristics of
housing types and 20–23 households from each survey section
were chosen by a rolling sampling system to represent all parts of
the nation. This method assured the homogeneous and indepen￾dent characteristics of all sampled households.
The subjects of KNHANES IV included all members of the
sampled households .1 year of age. The questionnaire was
composed of a health examination and interview, and a nutritional
interview. A total of 31,705 KNHANES IV sampled subjects in
9,421 households were screened. Among them, 23,632 (74.5%)
participated in the health examination and interview.
Definition of Sarcopenia and Obesity
This study utilized the data of KNHANES IV of subjects older
than 65 years of age with appendicular skeletal muscle mass
(ASM) determined by DXA (Discovery-WTM; HologicH, Inc.
Bedford, MA). ASM was defined as the sum of the lean soft tissue
masses of the arms and legs [20]. The precision of DXA has been
previously reported. In the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), DXA instruments were calibrat￾ed according the previously proposed method by Schoeller et al.
[21]. The reference values of the NHANES were obtained by the
calibration method previously published by Kelly et al. [22]. This
calibration method was periodically applied for the appropriate
comparison between the present and previous data. In addition,
DXA calibrations were maintained through an internal referenc￾ing system, which regularly measured bone and soft tissue
equivalent reference standards during the examination. A subject
was classified as having sarcopenia when having an ASM/weight
(kg) less than 1 SD below the gender-specific mean of a younger
reference group between 20 and 39 years of age (1,017 men and
1,284 women), which was modified from the studies of Janssen et
al. and Lim et al. [4,23]. For men, the cutoff value for sarcopenia
was 32.2% (ASM/weight), defined as less than 1 SD below the sex￾specific normal mean for the young reference group. For women,
the corresponding cutoff value was 25.6% (ASM/weight). A
subject was classified as obese if one had a BMI greater than
25 kg/m2 [24]. SO was defined when a subject satisfied the
criteria for both sarcopenia and obesity.
Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk Factors
The presence of CVD events was ascertained from the health
interview survey in KNHANES IV. Those who answered ‘‘yes’’ to
the question; ‘‘Have you ever been diagnosed with either acute
myocardial infarction, unstable or stable angina, or stroke by a
physician or a health care professional?’’ were classified as subjects
with previous CVD events. Subjects with DM were defined as
those who were identified in the health interview survey as having

a previous diagnosis of DM by a health care professional, and
those satisfying the criteria provided by the American Diabetic
Association as follows: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; measured
using high-performance liquid chromatography (BIO-RAD VAR￾IANTM II; BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA) $6.5% or a fasting plasma
glucose (measured by ADVIAH 1650; Siemens, Deerfield, IL)
$126 mg/dl [25]. Insulin level was measured using a c counter
(1470 Wizard, Perkin-Elmer Finland) with an immunoradiometric
assay (Biosource, Belgium). The homeostasis model assessment 2–
insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) was calculated using the equation
proposed by Levy et al. [26]. Subjects with HTN included those
who had either a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg
or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg. Data regarding
blood pressure in KNHANES IV consisted of the mean of three
separately measured blood pressures. In addition, subjects taking
antihypertensive medications and those who carried a diagnosis of
HTN were also included. Hyperlipidemia was defined using the
criteria established by the National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III as the following:
total cholesterol (T-chol) $240 mg/dl or triglycerides (TG)
$200 mg/dl [27] (all measured by ADVIA 1650TM). Also, those
who were taking lipid-lowering drugs or who had a previous
diagnosis of hyperlipidemia were included. Metabolic syndrome
(MetS) was defined according to the NCEP criteria using the Asia￾Pacific abdominal obesity criteria (waist circumference $90 cm in
men and $80 cm in women) [27]. Serum creatinine was
measured using the same instrument for a fasting plasma glucose
level.
Blood samples were collected from all subjects after .8 hours of
fasting. Specimens were immediately centrifuged, aliquoted,
frozen at 270uC, and moved to the central laboratory (NeoDIN
Medical Institute, Seoul, Korea), where they were analyzed within
Table 1. Clinical characteristics of the study subjects according to the presence of sarcopenia and obesity.

24 hours. To measure high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL￾C), a frozen sample was prepared according to the guidelines from
the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes (CLSI) C37-A.
These samples were analyzed in the Lipid Standardization
Program (LSP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in United States, and these values were compared with
those measured by the central laboratory. Differences between
these two measurements were adjusted by Passing Bablok
regression. The inter-assay coefficients of variation were 0.87–
3.28% for total cholesterol, and 0.86–3.95% for triglyceride.
Statistical Analysis
All sampling and weight variables were stratified, and the
statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version 10.1;
StataCorp. Texas, USA). In order to calculate the total population
that the sample would represent, we employed the stratification
variables and sampling weights designated by the Korean Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The sampling weights were
adjusted for nonresponse according to demographic factors after
surveys were completed. The total number of adults older than
65 years was calculated to be 4,888,503 people in 2009 (2,020,157
men and 2,864346 women). Statistics were used to describe the
demographics and CVD risk factors of all the samples according to
the sarcopenic body fat classification in either non-obese or obese
groups, which were tested for statistical significance by applying
the Student’s t-test for continuous variables. For categorical
variables, chi-squared tests were performed to evaluate the
difference between each group. Spearman correlation coefficients
were calculated to explore the association between CVD risk
factors and ASM/weight. Linear by linear association was
performed to observe the trend between the prevalence of
sarcopenia in each age group by gender. Multivariate logistic
regression analyses with backward selection were also used to
determine whether or not sarcopenia would be independently
associated with CVD. A p-value ,0.05 indicated statistical
significance.
Results
Prevalence of sarcopenia
Among 23,632 subjects who completed the health examination
and interview, 10,533 subjects underwent DXA to measure their
ASM, and 1,578 of these patients older than 65 years were
included in this study. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of sarcopenia
according to gender and age. The overall prevalence of sarcopenia
was 30.3% and 29.3% in men and women older than 65 years,
respectively. The prevalence trend according to the age group was
not significant either in male (P = 0.092) or in female (P = 0.512).
Clinical characteristics of the study subjects
The clinical characteristics of the study subjects are shown in
Table 1. Clinical, anthropometric, and metabolic parameters were
analyzed according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia and
obesity. The mean age of subjects was not significantly different in
those without obesity regardless of their sarcopenic body fat
classification, but those with obesity were significantly older when
sarcopenia was accompanied (P = 0.0023). In addition, most of the
continuous parameters except for HbA1c, T-chol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-C, demonstrated
statistically significant differences according to the presence or
absence of sarcopenia. In case of HDL-C and serum creatinine,
only those without obesity showed significant differences between
those with or without sasrcopenia. The prevalence of DM, HTN
and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher only in sarcopenia
subjects without obesity, while the presence of sarcopenia did not
affect their prevalences in obese subjects.
Association between sarcopenia and CVD
Spearman correlation analysis showed that ASM/weight
correlated negatively with age (r = 20.112), waist circumference
(r = 20.324), BMI (r = 20.497) and total cholesterol (r = 20.233,
all P,0.001). ASM/weight correlated positively with HDL-C
(r = 0.062, P = 0.039) (Table 2). Compared to non-sarcopenic
subjects without MetS (M(2)S(2)), sarcopenic subjects with MetS
(M(+)S(+)) had a higher prevalence of CVD (P = 0.008) (Table S1).
The prevalence of CVD among those with MetS was higher when
sarcopenia was also present with borderline significance
(P = 0.059). In addition, those without MetS were shown to have
a higher likelihood of concomitant CVD when they were
sarcopenic.
To determine the independent association between sarcopenia
and CVD, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed
(Table 2). The analysis included age, gender, DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, current smoking, obesity, serum creatinine, DM
with medications, HTN with medications, and hyperlipidemia
with medications and sarcopenia as dependent variables. The
results indicated that the odds ratio for CVD in those taking lipid
lowering medication was 3.026 (95% CI 1.509–6.607) and 1.768
(95% CI 1.075–2.909) in those with sarcopenia (Table 2).
However, obesity was found not to have a significant independent
association with CVD (Data not shown).
Discussion
In the present study, we found that the prevalence of sarcopenia
among those older than 65 years according to KNHANES IV was
30.3% in men and 29.3% in women. There has been no consensus
about the definition of sarcopenia. Baumgartner et al. defined
sarcopenia as a ratio of ASM-to-body height in meters squared
(ASM/height2
) less than two standard deviations below reference
values from young, healthy individuals measured with DXA [5]
and reported that the prevalence was more than 50% in persons
over 80 years of age. Davison et al. defined sarcopenia as muscle
mass which was indirectly calculated using the bioelectrical
impedance analysis equation, and reported that 1.7% of men
and 2.8% of women in the older US population from NHANES
III had sarcopenia [16]. Our study used the definition of
sarcopenia where ASM was taken as a percentage of body weight
(ASM/weight), which was modified from the studies of Janssen
et al. [4] because sarcopenia defined by ASM/weight exhibited a
more close association with metabolic parameters than when
defined by ASM/height2 [23]. A previous study which used the
same criteria for sarcopenia in an older Korean population

reported that the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was 35.1% in
men and 48.1% in women [23]. It is speculated that the difference
in prevalence of sarcopenia is mainly due to the lack of consensus
of its definition. It was interesting to notice that, unlike previous
findings [28,29], the prevalence of sarcopenia appeared to
decrease with increasing age older than 80 years as shown in
Figure 1. It is speculated that the small number of participants
older than 80 years may have contributed to this discrepancy.
Though not significant, the p trend for prevalence of sarcopenia
showed some increasing trend in male (p = 0.092), but female did
not show such significance. This may be due to a small number of
female subjects especially at the age between 80 and 84. A large
scaled study may resolve this issue.
Our study showed that sarcopenia was associated with
cardiovascular events independent of other well-known CVD risk
factors, which is in agreement with previous studies reporting the
independent association between sarcopenia and CVD. Sanada
et al. analyzed the data from the general Japanese population and
reported that sarcopenia was associated with greater arterial
stiffness in women, implying that sarcopenia is associated with risk
factors for CVD [14]. Low 24 h urinary creatinine excretion rate,
which has been shown to indicate the presence of sarcopenia, was
associated with major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause
mortality in the general population [18,19]. Our data also
demonstrated that those with obesity and sarcopenia had a higher
tendency toward CVD than those with obesity only (12.362.1%
vs. 10.062.2%, Table 1). In addition, those with MetS were more
likely to have CVD when sarcopenia was also present, and
surprisingly those without MetS were also more likely to
experience CVD when they had sarcopenia (Figure 2). These
findings suggest that sarcopenia may be an independent risk factor
for CVD. On the contrary, obese and sarcopenic postmenopausal
women have been reported to have a lower risk of CVD than
obese postmenopausal women without sarcopenia, possibly
implying a protective effect of sarcopenia [15]. Sarcopenia in
combination with obesity was not found to place older individuals
at higher risk for functional limitations [16]. However, it should be
mentioned that these results were derived from specific groups
such as postmenopausal women [15], and skeletal muscle mass
was estimated with predictive equations (skeletal muscle (kg) =
[(Ht2/R 60.401) + (sex 63.825) + (Age in years 620.071)]
+5.102, where Ht = height in cm, R = resistance in ohms from
bioelectrical impedence analysis, and sex = 0 for women and 1 for
men) [16] instead of direct measurement methods such as DXA.
It has been suggested that sarcopenia is not an isolated event but
is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in fat mass [30]. This
lipid infiltration plays a role in sustaining sarcopenia through a
macrophage mediated-release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
adipokines from adipocytes which induce chronic inflammation
[31]. Those with sarcopenia also commonly experience functional
impairment and physical disability [4,32] which causes a reduction
in muscle contraction-induced factors having an anti-inflammato￾ry effect, the so-called myokines [33]. The relative paucity of
myokines in sarcopenia may increase the risk of CVD [34].
Altogether, functional deterioration and chronic inflammation as
well as the reduction of anti-inflammatory substances observed in
those with sarcopenia contribute to the development of insulin
resistance, type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia and HTN [13], and
eventually raises the CVD risk.
On the other hand, it should be also noted that our analyses did
not demonstrate statistically significant correlation between ASM/
weight and HOMA2-IR (Table S1). In addition, the multiple
logistic regression analysis exhibited a significant association
between sarcopenia and CVD even after adjustment for obesity
(Table 2). Altogether, it is plausible that obesity in older
populations may not be a major factor which explains most of
the association between sarcopenia and CVD. This is conflicting
to a previous study suggesting that obesity-associated inflammation
leads to sarcopenia in older populations [35]. Additional studies
with a larger number of subjects and different population groups
should assess possible mechanisms other than insulin resistance
which could explain the association between sarcopenia and CVD.
The major limitation of this study was the cross-sectional design
that precluded addressing the issue of causation. In addition, since
we did not perform any imaging work-up such as coronary
angiogram or brain MRI to verify the presence of stroke or
coronary heart disease, there might be a number of undiagnosed
subjects with CVD, leading to an underestimate of the prevalence
of CVD. Despite these limitations, the major strength of this study
is that our findings were based on the data from a general
population study in Korea including ASM which was directly
measured with DXA. In addition, most of the previous studies
focused on the role of sarcopenic obesity as another risk factor for
CVD but not sarcopenia itself. To our knowledge, our study is the
first dataset available emphasizing the significant association of
sarcopenia alone with CVD among the general population older
than 65 years in Korea.
In conclusion, this study highlighted that sarcopenia was
associated with CVD independent of other well-documented
cardiovascular risk factors, renal function and medications in
elderly Korean adults. Efforts must be made to prevent and treat
sarcopenia in the older population, which would also decrease the
risk of CVD.
