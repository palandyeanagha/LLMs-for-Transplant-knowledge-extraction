Cellular immunity is key in determining the course 
and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
but is compromised in patients on immunosuppres￾sion, including transplant recipients and patients with 
glomerular diseases. A high proportion of patients 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection (the cause of COVID-19) pres￾ent with lymphopenia, and lymphocyte count has been 
negatively associated with disease severity1
. Critically ill 
patients with COVID-19 exhibit high levels of cytokines, 
particularly IL-6, reinforcing the concept that hyper￾inflammation may contribute to morbidity and mortal￾ity in this disease and underscoring the delicate balance 
between protective and dysregulated host immune 
responses.
Immunosuppressive agents used in the management 
of glomerular diseases and kidney transplant recipients 
(Supplementary Table 1) have an inherent potential to 
cause lymphopenia and/or impair lymphocyte function. 
In the absence of specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infec￾tions, most nephrology societies have issued recommen￾dations to reduce immunosuppression to levels that are 
considered safe, while acknowledging that balancing 
the risk of infections against the aim of disease control 
can be intricate even under ‘normal’ circumstances. 
However, such an approach is not feasible for patients 
with a de novo diagnosis of immune-mediated kidney 
disease, disease relapse or transplant rejection.
Glomerular diseases
No reports on treating glomerular diseases during the 
COVID-19 pandemic exist to date. Our suggestions are 
based on very little direct evidence but aim to balance 
the need to maintain viral host defence mechanisms 
against the need to suppress the immune system to treat 
the glomerular disease. The guiding principles of our 
suggestions are to avoid oversuppression of T cells and to 
consider the use of immunosuppressive drugs that may 
inhibit mechanisms of kidney injury and the cytokine 
storm that seems to be involved in the most severe cases 
of COVID-19.
Three clinical scenarios can be envisaged in patients 
with glomerulonephritis: first, either a new diagnosis 
or relapsing disease; second, the maintenance phase of 
immunosuppressive treatment; and third, long-term 
remission with ongoing tapering of immunosuppression. 
The decision to start immunosuppression in patients 
with newly diagnosed or relapsing glomerulonephritis 
and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection should ideally 
be based on kidney biopsy findings, kidney function, 
level of proteinuria, the expected tempo of the disease 
and comorbidities (Supplementary Table 2). If possible, 
treatment should be steered towards oral therapy to 
reduce in-person interactions with health-care person￾nel and avoid potential viral transmission and excessive 
use of personal protective equipment.
Despite ongoing controversies owing to a theoreti￾cal increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe 
COVID-19 in patients using renin–angiotensin system 
(RAS) inhibitors, patients with proteinuria should be 
initiated on RAS inhibitors, as numerous recommenda￾tions support their continued use during the pandemic2
. 
Initiation of immunosuppression should be considered 
in patients with diseases in which rapid deterioration 
of kidney function is expected and in those with severe 
nephrotic syndrome, which is accompanied by increased 
susceptibility to infections due to low IgG concentrations 
and depression of T cell function3
.
In patients receiving maintenance immunosuppres￾sion, an individualized risk–benefit evaluation is neces￾sary to assess the risk of immunosuppression versus the 
risk of glomerular disease relapse. If possible, patients 
who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should 
stay at home, and maintenance administration of drugs

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses important challenges to the care of 
patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases and to kidney transplant recipients. Here, we 
discuss the management of immunosuppression for these patients during the pandemic and 
suggest potential approaches that could be considered in the absence of validated strategies.

with long half-lives such as rituximab may be postponed 
until the current outbreak is under control. In the case 
of a clinic visit, we suggest that clinicians check mark￾ers of immunocompetence, such as white blood cells, 
differential blood count and immunoglobulin levels. 
Generally, we discourage prompt discontinuation of 
immunosuppression.
For patients in long-term remission, we encourage 
continued tapering of immunosuppression. If patients 
test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and have mild viral symp￾toms or are asymptomatic, we suggest reducing their 
glucocorticoid dose to ≤30mg daily and halting other 
immunosuppressive treatments that reduce lymphocyte 
numbers. If patients present with severe COVID-19, 
glucocorticoid use should likely be minimized to 20mg 
daily; however, such treatment decisions should be 
made on a case-by-case basis. As abrupt reduction or 
discontinuation of immunosuppression may result in a 
flare of glomerular disease, putting the kidney at risk or 
requiring intensification of immunosuppression, close 
follow-up of glomerulonephritis is required.
Among 701 patients with COVID-19 who were 
admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, 43.9% had pro￾teinuria and 26.7% had haematuria4
. This finding may 
point towards immune system activation during active 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may in turn increase 
the risk of relapse in patients with immune-mediated 
diseases. On the other hand, severe COVID-19 is often 
associated with severe lymphopenia, which could slow 
progression of immune-mediated glomerular disease if 
immunosuppression has to be temporarily discontinued.
No data are available on the safety of immunosup￾pressive treatments in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infec￾tions, and clinical practices are evolving. In patients 
with COVID-19 and active anti-glomerular basement 
membrane (anti-GBM) disease or severe anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 
(AAV), low doses of steroids (0.5mg per kg body weight) 
plus extracorporeal measures may be considered. Plasma 
exchange (PLEX) has a clear indication in anti-GBM 
disease and although the PEXIVAS trial failed to show 
long-term benefit of PLEX in AAV, it may be useful 
in the short term to mitigate AAV and allow reduced 
steroid doses5
. PLEX should be performed against fresh 
frozen plasma, and convalescent plasma might be used 
at the end of the session if the patient has COVID-19. 
Immunoadsorption together with low-dose mycopheno￾late mofetil or calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and a 
reduced dosage of glucocorticoids might be considered 
in patients with active lupus nephritis6
.
In AAV, immunomodulatory therapy with intra￾venous immunoglobulins is associated with a rapid 
reduction of disease activity and is an option for patients 
with COVID-19 (ref.7
). Most studies in patients with 
AAV have found increased levels of IL-6 and most other 
cytokines in blood and sites of active vasculitis, and 
treatment with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, 
is currently being investigated as potential therapy for 
this disease. Tocilizumab may also a promising agent 
for the management of cytokine release syndrome 
in COVID-19.
If rituximab is used for the management of glomer￾ular disease, patients may not develop antibodies 
to SARS-CoV-2 and could be at risk of reinfection. 
Additionally, a poor vaccination response should be 
expected once vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 become 
available.
Kidney transplant recipients
Kidney allograft recipients require lifelong maintenance 
immunosuppression. Therapeutic drug monitoring is 
the standard of care to balance efficacy and safety, that 
is, prevention of an alloimmune response (rejection) at 
only a moderately increased risk of infections. As data on 
the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive kidney transplant 
recipients are lacking, it is fair to assume that reducing 
maintenance immunosuppression could be key to their 
management. What remains unclear, however, is the 
degree of immunosuppressant reduction that is required 
to enable SARS-CoV-2 containment. Post-transplant 
immunosuppression, in particular with CNIs, compro￾mises the adaptive T cell response to a much greater 
extent than innate immunity and thus results in an 
increased risk of uncontrolled viral spreading and inva￾sion. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of ciclosporin 
decreased the expression of the N protein of human 
coronavirus 229E; this multifunctional protein is requi￾red for viral replication8
. Based on these in vitro data, 
it might be speculated that ciclosporin could be used 
as the preferred CNI during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
No data are available on whether tacrolimus derivatives 
or metabolites exhibit similar in vitro activity.
Reports of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipi￾ents are now emerging. In line with the experience in the 
general population, elderly transplant recipients are at 
increased risk of developing severe disease. Management 
of maintenance immunosuppression and initiation of 
antiviral, immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive 
therapies differ substantially between the published 
cases (Supplementary Table 3).
Based on the reported experience and good clinical 
practice extrapolated from other devastating courses of 
systemic viral infections, kidney transplant recipients 
with mild COVID-19 should continue to receive their 
CNIs and prescribed dose of glucocorticoids but their anti￾proliferative drugs should be stopped. In the minority 
of kidney allograft recipients with a severe course of

confirmed COVID-19 requiring ICU admission and 
mechanical ventilation, CNIs and antiproliferative drugs 
should be immediately withdrawn and glucocorticoid 
doses should likely be increased. Whether anti-cytokine 
drugs such as anti-IL-6 or complement inhibitors should 
be administered is currently unknown.
The WHO has launched a mega-trial (Solidarity, 
ISRCTN83971151) that will test four approaches for 
treatment of COVID-19: remdesivir; lopinavir–ritonavir; 
lopinavir–ritonavir with interferon-β1a; and chloro￾quine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Remdesivir 
was developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease 
and works through blockade of the RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase, a key viral enzyme, whereas lopinavir–
ritonavir is an anti-HIV protease inhibitor drug 
combination. The first trial from Wuhan in which 
lopinavir–ritonavir was compared with standard 
care reported negative results9
. In the Solidarity trial 
lopinavir–ritonavir will be tested alone or in com￾bination with interferon-β to control inflammation. 
Chloroquine and HCQ are antimalarial drugs that 
have been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against 
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Unusually, kidney transplant 
recipients are not excluded from the Solidarity trial and 
we hope that valid data will be available soon. Notably, 
some of the antiviral drugs exhibit significant drug–drug 
interactions, especially with CNIs, and thorough mon￾itoring of the trough levels of ciclosporin or tacrolimus 
will be necessary. As for all clinical decisions, the charac￾teristics of each individual patient need to be considered 
when making treatment decisions for COVID-19.
Collateral damage
Despite a lack of conclusive evidence of the efficacy 
of HCQ in combination with best supportive care for 
management of COVID-19, this drug is being used 
extensively for treatment and in some cases, prophyl￾axis. Some patients with lupus and rheumatoid arth￾ritis are reportedly experiencing a HCQ shortage, 
increasing their risk of relapse. Owing to recommen￾dations for ‘physical distancing’ to reduce the spread of 
SARS-CoV-2, outpatient appointments are being post￾poned in many countries and access to drug monitor￾ing might be reduced owing to the strain on health-care 
facilities caused by the pandemic.
Likewise, transplantation programmes have been 
suspended in various countries because of scarce 
resources (especially ICU beds) and concerns regarding 
the unforeseeable consequences of common immuno￾suppressive induction regimens. In the USA, 71.8% of 
surveyed physicians reported full suspension of live 
donation kidney transplant programmes, and 80.2% of 
deceased donor kidney transplant programmes were 
operating with restrictions10. In Austria, the transplan￾tation programme was reinitiated on 14 April 2020, 
but limited to kidney transplants (live and deceased 
donor) with low immunological risk that do not require 
anti-thymoglobulin or alemtuzumab induction regi￾mens. If necessary, administration of anti-thymoglobulin 
for rejection or as part of the induction protocol should 
be minimized, given its profound effects on lympho￾cytes. In the current situation, our practice is that 
patients on the transplant waiting list need to sign a 
form stating that they are aware of the potential risks 
associated with transplantation during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
In conclusion, medical evidence regarding optimal 
treatment approaches during this pandemic is currently 
limited. The suggestions discussed in this Comment 
remain to be validated in future studies.
