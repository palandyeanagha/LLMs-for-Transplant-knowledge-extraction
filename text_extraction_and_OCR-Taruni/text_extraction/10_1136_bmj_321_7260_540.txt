Abstract
Objective To determine whether there is a survival
benefit associated with cardiac transplantation in
Germany.
Design Prospective observational cohort study.
Setting All 889 adult patients listed for a first heart
transplant in Germany in 1997.
Main outcome measure Mortality, stratified by heart
failure severity.
Results Within 1 year after listing, patients with a
predicted high risk had the highest global death rate
(51% v 32% and 29% for medium and low risk
patients respectively; P < 0.0001), had the highest risk
of dying on the waiting list (32% v 20% and 20%;
P = 0.0003), and were more likely to receive a
transplant (48% v 45% and 41%; P = 0.01). Differences
between the risk groups in outcome after
transplantation did not reach significance (P = 0.2).
Transplantation was not associated with a reduction in
mortality risk for the total cohort, but it did provide a
survival benefit for the high risk group.
Conclusion Cardiac transplantation in Germany is
currently associated with a survival benefit only in
patients with a predicted high risk of dying on the
waiting list. Patients with a predicted low or medium
risk have no reduction in mortality risk associated
with transplantation; they should be managed with
organ saving approaches rather than transplantation.
Introduction
The survival benefit of cardiac transplantation as com￾pared with conventional treatment in advanced heart
failure has not been tested in a prospective randomised
trial. The main reason has probably been the assump￾tion that, since the introduction of cyclosporin
(ciclosporin) in 1980, the benefit of cardiac transplan￾tation over conventional treatment is clinically evident.1
Meanwhile, opposing developments have occurred.
On the one hand, scientific advances have improved
medical and surgical treatment for advanced heart
failure.2–4 On the other hand, listing of more critically ill
patients and use of so called marginal donor hearts,
driven by the increasing scarcity of donors, have been
associated with a lack of improvement of outcomes
after cardiac transplantation,5 6 even with better
transplant management. As a result, the survival
benefit of cardiac transplantation over other treatment
options is less clear than it seemed 10-20 years ago.
Consequently, the presently liberal practice of listing
patients with heart failure for transplantation must be
questioned until clear evidence of the benefits is avail￾able. This reasoning is in line with the current reassess￾ment of treatment options for patients with end stage
liver, lung, and renal disease.7–9
Since a randomised trial to test the survival benefit
of cardiac transplantation would be hampered by ethi￾cal concerns,10 we performed a prospective observa￾tional study. Such a method requires the assessment of
clinical and prognostic profiles in order to analyse the
effect of the intention to treat by transplantation. In
advanced heart failure only one validated prognostic
tool is currently available—the heart failure survival
score,11 which is an index for predicting mortality in
stable patients awaiting a heart transplant. Much as the
Child-Pugh and the Mayo scores are used to guide
clinical decisions at the time of listing for liver
transplantation,12 we applied the heart failure survival
score as an index of disease severity to our unselected
cohort of patients with advanced heart failure in order
to assess differences in outcomes. Specifically, we
analysed global mortality, waiting list mortality, and
mortality after transplantation as well as the effect of
cardiac transplantation on survival for the first time in
a complete national cohort of candidates for heart
transplantation stratified by disease severity at the time
of listing.
Patients and methods
Patients, parameters, and data acquisition
The study originated in a consensus decision of the
Heart Committee of the German Transplantation
Society and the Eurotransplant International Founda￾tion (Eurotransplant). Eurotransplant is the organ
exchange organisation in which transplant centres in
Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and the
Netherlands collaborate with their donor hospitals and
tissue typing laboratories. The goal was to create a con￾tinuous database to monitor quality of care in compli￾ance with the new German transplant law, which was
enacted in November 1997. The project was named
the “comparative outcomes and clinical profiles in
transplantation (COCPIT)” study.
All adults aged 16 or over who were consecutively
listed for cardiac transplantation between 1 January
and 31 December 1997 in any one of the centres then
performing cardiac transplantation in Germany were
included (see complete list of centres in the appendix).
Data were transmitted to Eurotransplant by every
centre and entered into a central database. Allocation
of heart transplants was in agreement with official
Eurotransplant allocation rules at the time. In brief, the
rules combine medical urgency, geography, matching
of donor and recipient body length, matching of ABO
blood group, and cumulative waiting time. Besides the
category of general urgency, centres were allowed
special urgency requests to Eurotransplant for up to
15% of their transplantations for patients considered
very sick. They were also allowed high urgency requests

and, consequently, in urgent need of retransplantation.
Heart failure survival score
The original heart failure survival score was derived
and validated between 1986 and 1995 in two US
cohorts of stable outpatient candidates for a cardiac
transplant.11 It is the weighted sum of seven
non-invasive clinical parameters, the weighting reflect￾ing the strength and direction of the association
between each parameter and outcome. Outcome was
defined as composite end points of death on the wait￾ing list and urgent transplantation. These parameters
were the presence of coronary artery disease (impact
of aetiology); the presence of intraventricular conduc￾tion delay (degree of cardiac damage); left ventricular
ejection fraction (extent of impairment of left ventricu￾lar function); heart rate and serum sodium concentra￾tion (measures of activation of the sympathetic nervous
system and renin-angiotensin system); and mean arte￾rial pressure and peak oxygen uptake (reflections of
the systemic impact of chronic heart failure).
The heart failure survival score was calculated as
the absolute value of the sum of the products of the
parameters and their computed coefficients:
Score = |[1(if coronary artery disease) and 0 (if not)] ×
0.6931 + [1 (if intraventricular conduction delay) and 0 (if
not)] × 0.6083 + (left ventricular ejection fraction (%)) ×
− 0.0464 + (heart rate) × 0.0216 + (sodium concentration)
× − 0.0470 + (mean arterial pressure) × − 0.0255 + (peak
oxygen uptake) × − 0.0546|.
By means of multivariate modelling and definition
of arbitrary cut-off points, three groups of disease
severity were defined in the derivation cohort for the
heart failure survival score (1986-91) and thereafter
confirmed in the validation cohort (1993-5). The low
risk, medium risk, and high risk patients had a one year
event-free survival of 93%, 72%, and 43% respectively
in the derivation cohort and 88%, 60%, and 35% in the
validation cohort.
For each patient in our study we calculated a heart
failure survival score using the same methodology. We
used the mean values of the derivation cohort for
missing covariates in our COCPIT cohort (see table).
We chose this approach in order to use the same
cut-off values for the definition of the three risk groups.
Statistical methods
Patients were followed up to 1 January 2000, giving a
minimum follow up of two years after registration.
Waiting list outcome consisted of one of the following:
transplantation, death on the waiting list, removal from
the list because of worsening condition, and removal
because of clinical improvement. We used the compet￾ing risk method to calculate the probability of each
waiting list outcome13 14 and the Kaplan-Meier method
to analyse the survival rates. To analyse global mortality
we ignored whether patients had received a transplant.
Throughout the analysis we tested the null hypoth￾esis of an absence of a difference among the three risk
groups versus the alternative hypothesis of a group
effect. For outcomes after listing we used the likelihood
ratio test. To assess global mortality and differences
between groups in outcome after transplantation we
used the log rank test.
We applied a time dependent, non-proportional
hazard model to cope with the problem of comparing
mortality for transplanted patients against that for
patients on the waiting list.8 This type of modelling is
required because the interpretation of this comparison
is hampered by a so called “time to event” bias. Thus, if
high risk patients were to receive a transplant within
days of listing, they would not have time to die on the
waiting list, and so a low waiting list mortality would be
obtained for this group. If, however, such high risk
patients were to receive a transplant after a longer
waiting time, they would have had more opportunity to
die on the waiting list and would be, by selection, a less
sick group at the time of transplantation than the
group initially classified as high risk. Consequently,
they would have a better outcome after transplanta￾tion. Hence, an analysis of patient mortality by
treatment modality in which the modality is not fixed
in time for all patients in the study needs to take into
account the time of switching from the waiting list
group to the transplantation group.
Furthermore, this approach allows for transient
modelling of the mortality risk after transplantation,
which is initially high and then decreases. We reported
the transplantation effect as relative risk, which is the
ratio of death after transplantation versus the risk of
death while on the waiting list for the same period of
time. If the relative risk falls below one the risk of dying
after transplantation is lower than the risk of dying on
the waiting list, which implies that patients benefit from
transplantation. If the relative risk remains above one,
survival after transplantation is not superior to waiting
list survival.
Results
Patients’ baseline characteristics
The table shows the patients’ characteristics. The range
and distribution of the heart failure survival score was
similar in the score’s original derivation cohort and in
the COCPIT cohort. In our study, 12%, 41%, and 47%
of patients were high risk, medium risk, and low risk
respectively, compared with 21%, 35%, and 44%, in the
original derivation cohort.

Outcome after listing
One year after listing, 33% of our total cohort had died
either before or after transplantation. Those patients
who were high risk according to heart failure survival
score had a significantly higher chance of dying than
patients at medium and low risk (51% v 32% and 29%
respectively; P < 0.0001) (fig 1).
Waiting list outcome
One year after registration, 424 patients (48%) had
undergone cardiac transplantation (358 in the general
urgency category, 62 in the special urgency category,
and four in the high urgency category); 196 patients
(22%) had been removed from the list because of death
(n = 182) or deterioration (n = 14); 79 patients (9%)
had been removed from the list because of improve￾ment in their condition; and 190 (21%) were still on the
waiting list. Figure 2 shows the mortality of patients on
the waiting list without transplantation, stratified by
heart failure survival score. Twenty per cent of the high
risk patients died within two months of listing, and this
proportion gradually increased to 32% at one year
after listing. In the medium and low risk groups the
probability of dying while waiting was significantly
lower (P = 0.0003) and without the initial high
mortality seen in the high risk group. The likelihood of
transplantation was also significantly higher in the high
risk group than in the medium and low risk groups
(P = 0.01): by two months and 12 months of listing
respectively, 27% and 48% of high risk patients, 17%
and 44% of medium risk patients, and 11% and 41% of
the low risk patients had received transplants (fig 3).
Outcome after transplantation
Survival at one year after transplantation for all
patients was 71% (95% confidence interval 68% to
74%). Survival at one year for the high risk group was
64%, not significantly different from the 76% and 75%
for the medium and low risk groups respectively
(P = 0.2) (fig 4).

Transplantation effect
For the total cohort there was no survival benefit from
transplantation (data not shown). For high risk
patients, however, a mortality risk reduction was
observed within two weeks of transplantation (relative
risk < 1.0). This benefit disappeared after eight months
(fig 5). On the other hand, the relative risk did not fall
below one for the medium and low risk patients at any
time after transplantation.
Discussion
In this complete national cohort of adult patients con￾secutively listed for cardiac transplantation in Ger￾many in 1997 no survival benefit accrued from
transplantation for the group as a whole. Yet,
transplantation had a beneficial effect in the high risk
group as early as two weeks after transplantation. Use
of the heart failure survival score allowed us to detect
differences between risk groups not only with regard to
the transplant effect but also with regard to mortality
while on the waiting list and global mortality.
Rationale for study
Since the introduction of cyclosporin in 1980 cardiac
transplantation has been considered superior to
conventional treatment for heart failure, though the
survival benefit of transplantation has never been
examined in depth. The Registry of the International
Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation reported a
one year survival of 78% in 1999 that had remained
constant over the previous five years,6 but the Henry
Mondor Hospital in Paris, a large and experienced car￾diac transplant centre, reported a much lower survival
rate at one year after transplantation of 62%.5 An
examination of the survival benefit from transplanta￾tion is therefore warranted. A randomised trial has
been viewed as ethically unacceptable because one of
the principles of such trials is that there is genuine
uncertainty about the comparative therapeutic merits
of each arm in a clinical trial. When the medical com￾munity has judged one proposed treatment to be bet￾ter than another, randomised trials cannot be truly free
of bias and may be considered unethical.10 15 16 Further￾more, the application of results from randomised trials
is restricted to patients with characteristics similar to
those of the cohort examined in the trials.17 Therefore,
we considered an outcome analysis based on a
prospective observational study to be a reasonable
approach to test our hypothesis. On the basis of our
results, the need for a randomised trial in cardiac
transplantation should be debated.
To assess the effect of cardiac transplantation on
outcome, a validated scoring system for assessing the
clinical severity and associated risk of advanced heart
failure is mandatory since any judgment on outcome
should take into account the severity of disease. We
therefore used the previously validated heart failure
survival score to assess risk. Our results confirm the
predictive power of the score for risk stratification in
this German waiting list cohort. Most importantly, the
survival advantage conferred by transplantation on the
different risk groups as defined by the score could be
assessed with a time dependent, proportional hazards
model.
Implications of study
The high risk patients in our cohort had a global mor￾tality of 51% at one year after listing. This rate reflects
the cumulative mortality of patients on the waiting list
and after transplantation. To our knowledge, no other
studies have used the same combined end point
because patients are usually censored at the time of
transplantation. The high global death rate warrants a
closer clinical surveillance at the time of listing of high
risk patients.
The transient nature of the survival benefit in the
high risk group is due to the changing composition of
the cohorts who have received a transplant and who
are still on the waiting list over time. Once patients
have been on the waiting list for several months they
become, by selection, a more stable population. All the
frail patients have already left the cohort, as a result of
either death or transplantation. This observation that
survival benefit vanishes as the waiting time lengthens
was described in 1991.18 Since disease severity is not
constant over time, the frequency of re-evaluation of all
listed patients should match the current risk of death. It
should be higher in high risk states and lower in low
risk states.
Our results also imply that the relative importance
of medical urgency and waiting time in the listing of
patients and allocation to transplantation should be
discussed. A policy may opt to allow high risk patients
only on the waiting list; this tends to balance organ
availability and organ need. Alternatively, all potential
candidates can be accepted on the waiting list and sub￾sequently prioritised according to medical urgency,
thereby decreasing the impact of waiting time in the
allocation algorithm for cardiac transplantation. This
change has been suggested by the German Trans￾plantation Society19 and the US Department of Health
and has been reinforced by the Institute of Medicine of
the US National Institutes of Health.20
Limitations of study

Henry Mondor Hospital. Possible explanations for
these differences include variations in selection of
recipients and donors for heart transplantation,
interdisciplinary cooperation, and management proto￾cols as well as considerable variability between centres
and regions. The German Transplantation Society has
initiated an audit to investigate the influence of these
factors.19 Whether our results are specific to the
German situation or may be generalised to other
countries needs to be investigated.
This study did not address the question of whether
quality of life was enhanced or cost of treatment
reduced by cardiac transplantation. These issues are
clearly important and need to be addressed in future
studies. Specifically, high risk, medium risk, and low risk
patients may benefit to different degrees from cardiac
transplantation with regard to quality of life and
resource consumption.
Conclusions
In this complete national cohort of German candidates
for cardiac transplantation we found a survival benefit
from transplantation only for patients with a predicted
high risk of dying on the waiting list. This observation
suggests that heart transplantation listing in Germany
should currently be limited to the sickest patients.
Patients with a predicted low or medium risk had no
mortality risk reduction from transplantation; they
should instead be managed with organ saving
treatments.

What is already known on this topic
Heart transplantation is considered the treatment
of choice for end stage heart failure because it is
assumed to improve survival and quality of life of
recipients
This assumption has not been tested in
randomised trials or observational cohort studies
What this study adds
In this complete national German cohort of
patients listed for cardiac transplantation during
1997 a survival benefit from transplantation was
found only in the subgroup at high risk of dying
without transplantation, whereas the medium risk
and low risk groups did not derive a survival
benefit
These findings challenge the current role of
cardiac transplantation in heart failure

Commentary: Time for a controlled trial?
Tom Treasure, Andrew Murday
In their report on cardiac transplantation in Germany
Deng et al conclude that, apart from patients with the
highest risk of dying on the waiting list, there is no sur￾vival advantage. The overall impression given is that
there is little to be gained from heart transplantation.
This is at odds with the strongly held beliefs of those
involved, both doctors and patients. Many transplant
recipients are enjoying full and active lives some years
after transplantation. Their enjoyment of life and con￾tinuing survival are attributed to their new hearts. This
difference in perception prompts the question: would a
controlled trial resolve the issue?
The German study concentrates on survival at one
year, which for transplanted patients was 71% (95%
confidence interval 68% to 74%). Better survival is
reported by the Registry of the International Society
for Heart and Lung Transplantation, at 78%,1 and by
UK transplant units, at 79% (77% to 82%) (audited
nationally under the auspices of the Clinical Effective￾ness Unit of the Royal College of Surgeons of
England).2 Thereafter, the death rate for heart
recipients has been found to be constant at about 4% a
year for the next 14 years.1 Five year survival in Britain
is 66% (56% to 73%).
In the absence of a controlled trial, what is the best
comparison group? The non-transplanted patients on
the waiting list selected in the German study are not
directly comparable. Furthermore, a comparison at
one year is heavily biased against the operated group,
who face their highest risk at operation and in the fol￾lowing weeks. In recent clinical trials of heart failure
the annual death rate ranged from about 10% to 20%
and was more or less constant over the two to three
years of the trials.3–5 Against such a reference
population a survival advantage would become evident
in the second year and would then widen. The worse
the natural course of the selected group the greater the
difference in survival.
Not only must comparison of survival be made
over a more realistic time span, but there must be rec￾ognition of the often dramatic restoration of wellbeing
seen in clinical practice and demonstrated objectively.6
All the usual obstacles to performing a trial can be
raised. Numbers are part of the problem. The German
study reports 424 adult cardiac transplant operations
among 32 units—that is, 13 cases per unit, barely one a
month. In the United States the average unit volume is
similar. Currently eight units carry out all the 300 adult
heart transplantations performed in Britain,2 and we
believe that there are good arguments for a reduction
rather than an increase in the number of units.
Centralisation of resources makes trials easier.
A common ethical obstacle to trials is that
treatment believed to be effective is denied to the con￾trol group, but many patients deemed clinically
suitable are denied a heart transplant because of the
limited number of donor organs. This makes
transplantation unusual in that there is an explicit
external constraint that limits volume, however much
funding were to be made available. It follows that if we
are to get the maximum benefit out of the limited
number of donor hearts we should use them where the
most quality years can be gained. A strategy aimed at
maximising the benefit gained by each donor organ
may be more logical than selecting the most desperate
recipients, the policy which would flow from the
interpretation of the German data. If there is real
doubt about where maximum benefits can be gained
the best way to resolve this is by clinical trial. There are
insufficient organs to go round,7 and once beliefs about
case selection are challenged by reports such as this
one from Germany it may be as ethical to allocate the
limited supply of hearts within carefully designed clini￾cal trials as by the clinical decisions of individuals.
