Abstract
Background: The role of the gut microbiota in Crohn’s disease (CD) is established and fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) is an attractive therapeutic strategy. No randomized controlled clinical trial results are
available. We performed a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled pilot trial of FMT in adults with colonic or ileo￾colonic CD.
Method: Patients enrolled while in flare received oral corticosteroid. Once in clinical remission, patients were
randomized to receive either FMT or sham transplantation during a colonoscopy. Corticosteroids were tapered and
a second colonoscopy was performed at week 6. The primary endpoint was the implantation of the donor
microbiota at week 6 (Sorensen index > 0.6).
Results: Eight patients received FMT and nine sham transplantation. None of the patients reached the primary
endpoint. The steroid-free clinical remission rate at 10 and 24 weeks was 44.4% (4/9) and 33.3% (3/9) in the sham
transplantation group and 87.5% (7/8) and 50.0% (4/8; one patient loss of follow-up while in remission at week 12
and considered in flare at week 24) in the FMT group. Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity decreased 6
weeks after FMT (p = 0.03) but not after sham transplantation (p = 0.8). Conversely, the CRP level increased 6 weeks
after sham transplantation (p = 0.008) but not after FMT (p = 0.5). Absence of donor microbiota engraftment was
associated with flare. No safety signal was identified.
Conclusion: The primary endpoint was not reached for any patient. In this pilot study, higher colonization by
donor microbiota was associated with maintenance of remission. These results must be confirmed in larger studies
(NCT02097797).

Background
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Its pathogenesis is not fully under￾stood, but it is now acknowledged that it is related to an
abnormal activation of the gastro-intestinal immune sys￾tem towards the gut microbiota in genetically susceptible
hosts and under the influence of environmental factors
[1]. Notably, many studies have shown that the intestinal
microbiota in Crohn’s disease patients is abnormal and
unbalanced when compared to non-IBD controls, with
an increased proportion of potentially pro-inflammatory
bacteria such as Escherichia coli and a decrease in anti￾inflammatory bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnit￾zii [2, 3]. Moreover, several studies in mice suggest that
this dysbiotic microbiota might play an active role in trig￾gering or worsening the inflammatory process [4, 5].
Current therapeutic strategies aim at inhibiting the
over-activated immune system and largely ignore the
microbial component of disease pathogenesis. Conven￾tional immunosuppressive treatments and biologics used
in CD are expensive and associated with potentially se￾vere complications such as infections [6, 7] and cancers,
[8] justifying the need for other innovative approaches.
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is now recom￾mended in guidelines for treating recurrent Clostridium
difficile infection [9–11]. Although the pathogenesis in￾volved in CD is different, FMT is a potential therapeutic
strategy since transferring a healthy microbiota to a CD
patient could restore the appropriate host-microbiota
crosstalk.
No randomized controlled study evaluating FMT in
CD patients has been published to date, but heteroge￾neous cases or small series, as well as small open-label
uncontrolled studies, have been reported and suggest a
beneficial effect for the induction of clinical remission
[12–15]. Most of the available data regarding FMT in
IBD is in ulcerative colitis (UC). The efficacy of FMT in
patients with UC has been evaluated in four published
randomized controlled studies, all of which aimed at in￾ducing remission. Three studies demonstrated the super￾iority of FMT compared to placebo [16–18] and one did
not show significant differences between the two groups
studied [19]. However, even in the studies that demon￾strated superiority of FMT, the difference compared
with placebo was moderate, with 24, 27, and 32% remis￾sion rates versus 5, 8 and 9% at 7 and 8 weeks, respect￾ively, despite multiple FMT administrations. Patients
received FMT enemas once a week for 6 weeks in the
first study [16], 1 FMT via colonoscopy, followed by 5
FMT enemas per week for 8 weeks in the second study
[17] and 1 FMT via colonoscopy, followed by 2 FMT en￾emas over 7 days in the third study [17]. Moreover, each
FMT was derived from 3 to 7 donors in the second
study and from 3 to 4 donors in the latter study. These
results suggest that targeting only the gut microbiota
might not be sufficient in IBD. Moreover, the ideal time
to perform an FMT in IBD is not known, although there
are some arguments to suggest that performing an FMT
in patients who have already achieved remission might
be more appropriate than during an active flare, particu￾larly in Crohn’s disease [20]. As the gut microbiota is
dramatically altered by intestinal inflammation, a healthy
microbiota transferred to an inflamed gut might be rap￾idly altered, thus limiting its potential therapeutic effect.
Furthermore, transferring a massive quantity of microbes
into an inflamed gut with epithelial barrier disruption
could potentially have detrimental effects by stimulating
inflammation and allowing bacterial translocation. This
is of particular relevance in CD, a condition that is char￾acterized by transmural inflammation.
Here, we performed the first randomized controlled
study evaluating FMT in CD. We chose an original strat￾egy, targeting both immune and microbiota components
of the disease pathogenesis, in which a single FMT or
sham transplantation was performed in patients in whom
clinical remission had been achieved using corticosteroids.
Materials and methods
Study design
We conducted a multicenter (n = 6), randomized,
single-blind placebo-controlled trial of fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) in patients with colonic or ileo￾colonic Crohn’s disease who achieved remission with
corticosteroids. In the FMT group, patients received a
single fecal transplant (fecal microbiota from one healthy
donor) after clinical remission was obtained using oral
corticosteroids. The fecal microbiota consisted of 50–100 g
of stool from a donor resuspended in 250–350 ml of
sterile sodium chloride and filtered. After colon cleansing
(4 l of polyethylene glycol), this fecal preparation, or the
vehicle (physiological serum) in the sham group, was
infused into the cecum during a colonoscopy.
The sponsor of the study was Assistance Publique–
Hôpitaux de Paris (Department for Clinical Research
and Innovation).
Participants
Adult patients (aged 18–70 years) with health insurance
who had Crohn’s disease with colonic or ileo-colonic in￾volvement were recruited between August 26, 2014, and
February 14,
2017, from the Departments of Gastroenter￾ology of Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris, France), Lariboi￾siere Hospital (Paris, France), Henri Mondor Hospital
(Creteil, France), Saint Louis Hospital (Paris, France),
Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal (Creteil, France), and
Montfermeil Hospital (Montfermeil, France).
Patients were not eligible if there was active fistulizing
disease; perianal or abdominal abscesses; complications

requiring surgical treatment; treatment with anti￾tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (ongoing or
stopped in the month preceding randomization); im￾munosuppressant treatment started or stopped in the
3 months preceding randomization; intake of non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the 4
weeks preceding randomization; antibiotic or antifun￾gal treatment in the 4 weeks preceding colonoscopy;
probiotics intake in the 4 weeks preceding colonos￾copy; Clostridium difficile infection in the 10 days pre￾ceding randomization; and any contraindication to
colonoscopy or anesthesia and pregnancy.
All the patients except one were recruited in St Antoine
Hospital (the last one was recruited in Lariboisiere
Hospital). The FMT or sham, as well as the follow-up, was
performed for all patients in Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris,
France).
Patients with active disease at screening (defined as a
Harvey Bradshaw Index > 4) were selected and treated or￾ally with prednisolone (minimum dose 40 mg/day, max￾imum dose 1 mg/kg/day). Patients who achieved clinical
remission within the 3 weeks following the commence￾ment of corticosteroids (defined as a Harvey Bradshaw
Index < 5) were randomized to receive either FMT or
sham FMT by colonoscopy. The maximum time between
starting corticosteroids and FMT or sham FMT was
5 weeks. Corticosteroids were then tapered according
to a pre-defined schedule: decrease by 10 mg every
week until 50% of the initial dose and then decrease
by 5 mg per week until complete cessation. All pa￾tients had a clinical assessment and biochemical
evaluation at weeks (W) 2, W6, W10, W14, W18, and
W24 after the intervention and a second colonoscopy
at W6 (Additional file 1). Clinical activity was evalu￾ated with the Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI)
and Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Biological analysis
included blood C reactive protein (CRP) level and
fecal calprotectin level. Endoscopic lesions were
scored using the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of
Severity (CDEIS).
Donors
We recruited healthy donors by advertisement in an au￾thorized biomedical research location, targeting healthy
volunteers, outlining donor visits, and based upon the
following criteria:
– Age > 20 years and < 50 years
– 27 kg/m2 > body mass index > 17 kg/m2 (body mass
index is defined as the body mass divided by the
square of the body height)
– Regular bowel movements with usually one bowel
movement in the morning
– Health insurance
Donor screening was performed according to the
French National Security Drugs Agency (ANSM) recom￾mendations (see Additional file 2 for details). According
to these recommendations, the screening test results
were valid for 2 weeks, corresponding to the authorized
donation period.
Of the 213 donors who were initially prescreened by
telephone, 64 underwent the clinical and biological
screening and five ultimately served as study donors. As
FMT was performed with fresh stool, three donors pre￾screened for CMV, EBV and toxoplasmosis status were
selected and screened according to ANSM recommenda￾tions for each patient in the FMT arm. On the day of
the planned FMT, one to three donors with valid screen￾ing tests were convened at the hospital for stool dona￾tion. In total, five different donors were used. Each FMT
was prepared freshly from one single donor. One donor
was used for three recipients, one donor was used for
two recipients, and the three last donors were used for a
single recipient each.
Sample preparation
On the day of the planned FMT, fresh stool from do￾nors, kept at 4 °C, was used within 6 h of emission. Fifty
to 100 g of stool was resuspended in 250–350 ml of ster￾ile sodiume chloride (0.9% NaCl), homogenized in a sin￾gle usage blender and filtered using sterile, non-woven
gauze. The solution was adjusted to a final volume of
300 ml with sterile saline and transferred to five 60-ml
syringes for administration through the operating chan￾nel of the colonoscope during colonoscopy. All the prep￾aration procedures were performed in a biological safety
cabinet.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the successful colonization of
the donor microbiota at 6 weeks. Colonization was de￾fined as being successful if the fecal microbiota of the re￾cipient 6 weeks after FMT was more similar to the fecal
microbiota of the donor than to the recipient before
FMT (Sorensen’s index [recipient 6 weeks after FMT vs
donor] > Sorensen’s index [recipient 6 weeks after FMT
vs recipient before FMT]). Moreover, it was required
that the similarity (assessed by Sorensen’s index) be￾tween donor and recipient at 6 weeks was ≥ 0.6.
Secondary endpoints were the feasibility of the FMT
procedure (frequency of evaluable patients in each
group) and the clinical flare rate in the 24 weeks follow￾ing FMT. A clinical flare was defined as a CDAI > 220
points, by a CDAI between 150 and 220 with an increase
> 70 compared with baseline, or by the need for surgery
or to start a new medical treatment for CD. Flare
outcome was analyzed in the intention to treat popula￾tion throughout the paper. CRP, leukocyte level, fecal
Sokol et al. Microbiome (2020) 8:12 Page 3 of 14

calprotectin, CDEIS, fecal microbiota composition, and
diversity were also compared among groups.
Fecal sample collection
Fecal samples were longitudinally collected from pa￾tients, 2 weeks before FMT (W2), just before FMT (D0)
and then at W2, W6, W10, W14, W18, and W24. The
fecal samples were freshly collected by the patient in a
sterile container and kept at 4 °C in an anaerobic atmos￾phere using an Anaerocult® system until storage at −
80 °C, 6 h maximum after a bowel movement.
Sample size
We hypothesized that at least 80% of the recipients in
the FMT group would achieve fecal transplantation suc￾cess compared to 0.5% in the control group (sham trans￾plantation), using a bilateral test, with alpha = 5% and
beta = 10%. Considering 50% of non-evaluable patients,
24 patients (12 in each group) were estimated to be re￾quired for inclusion.
Randomization
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Centralized
block randomization was performed by an independent
statistician from the clinical research platform (URC￾Est) and the size of the blocks was not communicated to
the investigator.
Ethics
The study was performed in accordance with the re￾quirements of Good Clinical Practice and the Revised
Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered on
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02097797). All participants
provided written informed consent to participate after
receiving verbal and written information about the
study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics commit￾tee (Comite de Protection des Personnes, CPP), on July
17, 2013. The final authorization was obtained a year
later from the French National Security Drug Agency
(Agence National pour la Sécurité du Médicament).
Gut microbiota analysis
Fecal genomic DNA was extracted from 200 mg of feces
as previously described [4]. Following microbial lysis
with both mechanical and chemical steps, nucleic acids
were precipitated in isopropanol for 10 min at room
temperature, incubated for 15 min on ice, and centri￾fuged for 30 min at 15,000g and 4 °C. Pellets were sus￾pended in 112 μL of phosphate buffer and 12 μL of
potassium acetate. After RNase treatment and DNA pre￾cipitation, nucleic acids were recovered via centrifuga￾tion at 15,000g and 4 °C for 30 min. The DNA pellet was
suspended in 100 μL of TE buffer.
Microbial diversity and composition were determined
for each sample by targeting a portion of the ribosomal
genes. A 16S rRNA gene fragment comprising V3 and
V4 hypervariable regions (16S; 5′-TACGGRAGGC
AGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTACCNGGGTATCTAAT-3′) was
amplified using an optimized and standardized 16S￾amplicon-library preparation protocol (Metabiote, Gen￾oScreen). Briefly, 16S rRNA gene PCR was performed
using 5 ng genomic DNA according to the manufac￾turer’s protocol (Metabiote) using 192 bar-coded primers
(Metabiote MiSeq Primers, GenoScreen) at final concen￾trations of 0.2 μM and an annealing temperature of
50 °C for 30 cycles. The PCR products were purified
using an Agencourt AMPure XP-PCR Purification sys￾tem (Beckman Coulter), quantified according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, and multiplexed at equal con￾centrations. Sequencing was performed using a 250-bp
paired-end sequencing protocol on an Illumina MiSeq
platform (Illumina) at GenoScreen. Raw paired-end
reads were subjected to the following process: (1) quality
filtering using the PRINSEQ-lite PERL script [21] by
truncating the bases from the 3′ end that did not exhibit
a quality < 30 based on the Phred algorithm; (2) paired￾end read assembly using FLASH (fast length adjustment
of short reads to improve genome assemblies) with a
minimum overlap of 30 bases and a 97% overlap iden￾tity; and (3) searching and removing both forward and
reverse primer sequences using CutAdapt, with no mis￾matches allowed in the primers sequences. Assembled
sequences for which perfect forward and reverse primers
were not found were eliminated.
The sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered
using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
(QIIME, version 1.9.1) software package [22], and the
forward and reverse Illumina reads were joined using
the fastq-join method (http://code.google.com/p/ea￾utils). Following an open reference picking strategy, the
sequences were assigned to OTUs using the UCLUST
algorithm [23] with a 97% threshold of pairwise identity
and classified taxonomically using the Silva reference
database (version 132) [24]. Principal coordinate analyses
of the Bray Curtis distance were performed and used to
assess the variation between groups (beta diversity).
Significance was assessed using ANOSIM (9999 permu￾tations). The Shannon and Chao1 diversity indices were
calculated using rarefied data (depth = 29,000 se￾quences/sample) and used to characterize species diver￾sity in a community. Raw sequence data (joined
sequences) are accessible in the European Nucleotide
Archive (accession number PRJEB33031) and the corre￾sponding metadata file is available in Additional file 3.
Sourcetracker, a Bayesian approach, was used to
identify sources and proportions of OTUs in the differ￾ent samples [25]. Differential analysis was performed
Sokol et al. Microbiome (2020) 8:12 Page 4 of 14

using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
pipeline [26].
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis followed the intention-to-treat
approach and results were reported according to the
CONSORT statement recommendations.
Patients’ characteristics were described globally and
per group of randomization. Qualitative data were
expressed as number (%) and quantitative data were
expressed as medians and interquartile range (IQR). The
primary outcome was compared between groups with a
Fisher’s exact test. One primary outcome was missing at
6 weeks (one patient was lost to follow-up) and was re￾placed by failure. Quantitative variables were compared
using a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
The similarity of the fecal microbiota samples was
assessed using the Sorensen similarity index (Sorensen
similarity index = [1 – Bray Curtis dissimilarity index]).
The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used
to compare the similarity indices between groups. Ex￾ploratory analysis compared survival without clinical
flare until W24 within groups.
A graphical representation of the probability of
remaining in remission was drawn using the Kaplan￾Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare
survival curves. All tests were two-sided. p values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant. SAS® 9.3 soft￾ware (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for statis￾tical analyses. Prism 7.04 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
92037, USA) was used to make graphics.
Results
Patient characteristics and primary outcome
Overall, 24 patients were included in the study and 21
patients were randomized. Among the 10 and 11 pa￾tients allocated respectively to the sham and to the fecal
transplantation groups, 9 and 8 went on to receive the
sham and fecal transplantation (included in the intention
to treat analysis); 3 patients were ineligible because of
antibiotic intake (these patients were found positive for
C. difficile or Dientamoeba fragilis following their initial
screen) and one because no compatible donor was iden￾tified (Fig. 1a). The characteristics of the two groups an￾alyzed at the time of intervention are shown in Table 1
(characteristics of patients at selection before starting
corticosteroids are presented in Additional file 4). Six
patients (3 in each group) dropped out while in the
study, with no reason given. Four of them experienced a
flare prior to dropping out. For one patient, clinical
follow-up was obtained by contacting the patient and his
physician. The last patient dropped out while in remis￾sion at week 12 and was considered in flare at week 24.
Thirteen serious adverse events were reported, includ￾ing 9 CD flares (6 in the sham group and 3 in the FMT
group). Among the 6 others, there included one episode
of gastroenteritis, one episode of food poisoning, one
case of transient asthenia, and one cutaneous abscess re￾ported in the FMT group, while one case of shoulder
fracture and one case of decreased visual acuity were re￾ported in the sham group. None of the adverse events
were considered to be related to the FMT.
None of the subjects included in the study achieved
the primary endpoint regarding the colonization of the
donor microbiota at 6 weeks as defined in the protocol,
as the donor-recipient Sorensen’s index at W6 was
below 0.6 in all patients (Fig. 1b). However, the judg￾ment criterion was defined in 2012, in a period where
no reference was available on the topic and was thus ar￾bitrary. All the analyses thus focused on secondary
endpoints.
Efficacy in maintaining remission
The incidence of flare was lower in the FMT than in
the sham group but the difference did not reach stat￾istical significance (log-rank test, p = 0.23, steroid-free
clinical remission at week 10: 87.5% (7/8) in the FMT
group vs 44.4% (4/9) in the sham group, Fig. 2a, b).
Among the three patients who experienced a flare in
the FMT arm, two were treated with adalimumab and
no data was available for the third patient. Among
the six patients who experienced flare in the sham
arm, one received ustekinumab, one received
corticosteroids and azathioprine, three received corti￾costeroids, and no data was available for the last pa￾tient. The CDEIS decreased significantly 6 weeks after
FMT (8.5 [4.6; 13.0] vs. 3.5 [1.0; 8.9]; p = 0.03) but
not after sham (2.4 [0.0;8.3] vs. 2.7 [0.7;10.0]; p = 0.8;
Fig. 2c). Of note, one patient in each group was not
evaluable for CDEIS at week 6 because of a bowel￾cleansing problem and was thus not taken into ac￾count for this specific analysis. Moreover, the lower
CDEIS score at baseline in some patients of the sham
group might limit the possibility to observe a further
decrease. Similarly, 6 weeks after FMT, CRP levels
remained stable (3.0 [3.0; 3.0] vs. 3.0 [3.0; 14.2] mg/l;
p = 0.5) while they had already started to increase in
the sham group (3.0 [3.0; 4.2] vs. 6.9 [4.0; 8.7] mg/l;
p = 0.008; Fig. 3d). Although some trends were ob￾served, no statistically significant differences were ob￾served between D0 and W6 in the FMT and sham
groups regarding HBI, CDAI, and fecal calprotectin
(Additional file 5 A–C). Neutrophil counts decreased
in both groups, but this was significant only in the
FMT group (Additional file 5 D). The number of sub￾jects included was too low to reach statistical signifi￾cance in several secondary endpoints. Based on the
Sokol et al. Microbiome (2020) 8:12 Page 5 of 14

25% difference observed between the intervention and
control groups regarding the relapse rate at W24, 96
or 122 patients would be required to achieve suffi￾cient statistical power for unilateral and bilateral tests,
respectively (with alpha = 5% and beta = 20%).
FMT does not systematically induce shifts in microbiota
composition
The gut microbiota composition and diversity was
assessed in donors and patients at each visit. Alpha di￾versity was evaluated using the Shannon and Chao1

For b, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used

indices. We observed a significant increase in alpha di￾versity following FMT but not sham (Fig. 3a). However,
this change was transient and alpha diversity returned to
its initial level 14 weeks after FMT. When analyzed glo￾bally, beta diversity showed a trend towards a change in
the microbiota profile between D0 and W6 in the FMT
(p = 0.07) but not the sham (p = 0.7) group (Fig. 3b).
We then looked at the similarity between donor and
recipient microbiota using the Sorensen index. No statis￾tically significant difference was observed between the
FMT and sham group at week 6 (Fig. 3c). However, for
two patients in the FMT group, the Sorensen similarity
index was particularly low at week 6 (0.12 and 0.15, re￾spectively) compared to the other patients (0.29 to 0.56).
This means that the donor microbiota poorly colonized
these two patients, who can thus be considered as FMT
failures. When excluding these two patients, a difference
between the FMT and sham groups was clearly apparent
(Additional file 6 A). In the patients with FMT failure, the
increase in alpha diversity was shorter than that observed
in the patients with FMT success (Additional file 6 B).
Interestingly, colonization by the donor microbiota
seemed to persist over time, as indicated by the relative
stability of donor-patient similarity until the end of the
follow-up period (Fig. 3d). A similar signal was observed
when looking at OTUs that appeared after FMT or sham
transplantation, as the abundance of these OTUs persisted
in recipients throughout the follow-up period (Fig. 3e, f).
We then studied the patients individually to better ex￾plore differing behaviors of the microbiota following
transplantation into different recipients. The evolution
of the fecal microbiota of one patient with FMT success
and one patient with FMT failure are shown in Figs. 4
and 5. The same data for the other patients are shown
in Additional files 7 and 8. In a patient with successful
engraftment of the donor microbiota, there is a dramatic
shift of the patient’s microbiota towards the donor’s
microbiota after FMT. This change remains relatively
stable during the follow-up period (Fig. 4a). Conversely,
in a patient with FMT failure, the microbiota does not
change between W0 and W2 and continues to follow an
erratic path without getting closer to the donor’s micro￾biota at any subsequent time point (Fig. 4b). The abun￾dance of bacterial taxa after FMT is shown in Fig. 5 and
in Additional file 8. We used SourceTracker to identify
the OTUs from donors that were found in recipients
after FMT. Although the low number of patients did not
allow us to demonstrate statistically significant differ￾ences, the proportion of donors’ OTUs at W2 and W6
was higher in patients with FMT success than in those

with FMT failure (Additional file 8 C). Similar results
were observed when using unweighted Unifrac similarity
index (Additional file 9).
Finally, we looked at the clinical outcome according to
FMT success or failure. The two patients who failed to
be colonized by the donor microbiota exhibited an early
flare, similar to the sham transplantation group. Con￾versely, patients with successful donor microbiota en￾graftment experienced a very low flare rate (log-rank
test FMT vs sham group, p = 0.054, Additional file 10
A). Their steroid-free clinical remission rate at week 10
was higher than the sham group (100% vs 44.4%, p =
0.04, Additional file 10 B).
We then looked for microbial factors that could ex￾plain differences between FMT success and FMT failure.
Notably, we did not find any explanation for efficacy
based on the donor profiles. Using LEfSe (linear
discriminant analysis effect size), no significant differ￾ences were observed in the composition of donors asso￾ciated with success vs failure. We next compared
recipient profiles and observed that failure to be colo￾nized by the donor microbiota was significantly associ￾ated with higher baseline levels of several taxa belonging
to the Gammaproteobacteria class of the Proteobacteria
phylum (Fig. 6a).
Finally, we analyzed the overall population and looked
for microbiota-based predictors of flare before the end
of follow-up at 6 weeks post FMT or sham. We identi￾fied several taxa associated with flare, including many
taxa belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria class and
the Clostridiales order comprising Ruminococcus gnavus.
In addition, we also observed taxa associated with
maintenance of remission, such as Ruminococcaceae,
Coprococcus, and Desulfovibrio genus (Fig. 6b).

Discussion
In this pilot randomized controlled study, we evaluated
the effect of a single FMT administered via colonoscopy
in patients with colonic or ileo-colonic CD who achieved
clinical remission with systemic corticosteroids. This is
the first and only randomized controlled study evaluating
FMT in CD to be published so far. Moreover, the original
strategy we tested has never been evaluated in IBD.

Its primary endpoint, a > 60% similarity with the
donor microbiota at week 6 according to the Sorensen
similarity index, had been defined in 2012 without guid￾ance from the recent literature. None of the subjects
reached this endpoint, which however now appears in￾appropriate as some clinically relevant endpoints were
achieved. Although not statistically significant, we ob￾served a higher rate of steroid-free clinical remission in
the FMT than in the sham group. We also observed sig￾nificant benefit of FMT over sham with respect to
CDEIS and CRP level. Notably, the absence of donor
microbiota engraftment was associated with failure to
maintain clinical remission.
Crohn’s disease, like UC, is thought to be related to an
abnormal crosstalk between an over-activated intestinal
immune system and an abnormal gut microbiota. Envir￾onmental and host genetic factors are also involved, and
some of them may affect the disease through an effect
on the gut microbiota. Indeed, several studies in mice
have demonstrated that genetic defects in innate im￾munity genes [4, 27] or environmental factor [28] can
induce alteration in gut microbiota composition and/or
functions leading to deleterious effects on the host and
favoring intestinal inflammation. Moreover, intestinal in￾flammation by itself induces perturbations in the com￾position of the gut microbiota [29]. These data suggest a
circular causality between alterations to the gut micro￾biota and an over-activated immune system, fueled by
environmental factors. The current treatments used in
IBD do not take into account these new concepts, as
they only target the immune actor in disease pathogen￾esis. FMT studies performed to date may encounter the
same pitfall by targeting only the gut microbiota actor.
In the current study, we tested for the first time a thera￾peutic approach targeting both the immune system and
the microbiota by first shutting off inflammation with
systemic corticosteroids, before reshaping the gut micro￾biota with FMT. We chose a relatively weak criterion
(HBI < 5) to assess the corticosteroid-induced clinical
remission as it represented only a step before initiating
FMT or sham. This explains why we got a high response
rate to corticosteroid. Although the number of subjects
included was low, we think the results are of interest as
they suggest that this strategy might be valid and may
also give some insight into the dynamics of gut micro￾biota colonization following FMT.
Our data show a trend in favor of FMT regarding
maintenance of remission. Although the delta between
the FMT and sham groups regarding steroid-free clinical
remission at week 10 was superior to 40%, the difference
was not statistically significant, most likely because of a
lack of power due to insufficient patient numbers.
Nevertheless, we observed significant differences in
terms of endoscopic activity and CRP level. Between day
0 and week 6, CDEIS decreased and CRP level remained
stable in the FMT group, while CDEIS remained un￾changed and CRP increased in the sham group, suggest￾ing that inflammation was more successfully controlled
in the FMT group. These results with regard to clinical
efficacy are illuminated by the gut microbiota analysis.
Firstly, we observed that in most of the patients, FMT is
associated with an important and durable shift in the gut
microbiota towards the donor’s microbiota. Surprisingly,
we observed that the increase in alpha diversity was
transient whereas the change in beta diversity was
mostly maintained throughout the 6 months of follow￾Fig. 4 Evolution of the fecal microbiota beta-diversity in patients with successful or unsuccessful colonization by the donor microbiota. Principal

up. This suggests that some of the donor’s bacteria may
colonize the patient in the long term. Secondly, we ob￾served that two of the patients were not colonized by
the donor’s microbiota, representing what we termed an
“FMT failure.” These failures to colonize were not due
to insufficient bowel cleansing in these patients, as it
was judged perfect by the endoscopist on both occasions
(Boston score 9/9). As some studies suggest a donor ef￾fect [16], we looked for differences between those associ￾ated with FMT failure vs FMT success but did not find

any significant difference. Here again, these results
should be taken cautiously as the number of patients
was extremely low. We then looked for factors on the
host side and observed that FMT failure was associated
with enrichment in different members of the Gamma￾proteobacteria class (Proteobacteria phylum) such as
Klebsiella, Actinobacillus, and Haemophilus. These re￾sults suggest that the baseline recipient microbiota
might influence the success of donor microbiota
colonization and consequently, the expected clinical out￾come. This study has several limitations. The first one is
its small size which requires to take its results cautiously.
There were some non-significant differences at baseline
in the two groups such as a lower CDEIS score in some
patients of the sham group that might limit the possibil￾ity to observe a further decrease. Larger studies are
needed to validate these results.
The relatively low similarity between donor and recipi￾ent microbiota at W6 suggest that a higher number of
FMTs per patient and/or the use of multidonor infusions
might be associated with better outcome, as suggested
by other investigators in UC [17, 30].
Conclusion
In this first randomized, sham-controlled pilot trial
evaluating FMT in Crohn’s disease, the primary end￾point regarding donor microbiota colonization at week 6
was not achieved. The low similarity index between
donor and recipient microbiota in some patients sug￾gests that a single FMT might not be enough to induce
significant changes in these patients. However, the bene￾fit of FMT over sham transplantation was observed for
several clinically relevant endpoints, including CDEIS
and CRP level. These results need to be confirmed in
larger studies. Several questions remain to be addressed.
Can the current results be generalized to all CD patients
and to UC? It is likely that if a “donor effect” exists, the
study was underpowered to detect it. Many questions
are also raised regarding the procedure, such as delivery
mode, aerobic vs anaerobic stool preparation, the num￾ber of donors, and the need for single or repeated FMT?
These questions will have to be addressed in larger stud￾ies in order to determine whether FMT is a viable thera￾peutic approach in common and long-term conditions
such as IBD.
