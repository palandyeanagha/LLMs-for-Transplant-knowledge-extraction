Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its relationship
with cardiovascular disease and other extrahepatic
diseases
Leon A Adams,1 Quentin M Anstee,2,3 Herbert Tilg,4 Giovanni Targher5
ABSTRACT
Key physiological functions of the liver, including glucose
and lipid metabolism, become disturbed in the setting of
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and may be
associated with a systemic inflammatory ‘milieu’ initiated
in part by liver-secreted cytokines and molecules.
Consequently, the pathophysiological effects of NAFLD
extend beyond the liver with a large body of clinical
evidence demonstrating NAFLD to be independently
associated with both prevalent and incident
cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease
(CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The
magnitude of risk of developing these extrahepatic
diseases parallels the underlying severity of NAFLD, such
that patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
appear to be at greater risk of incident CVD, CKD and
T2DM than those with simple steatosis. Other modifiers
of risk may include genetic variants (eg, patatin-like
phospholipase domain-containing 3 and trans-membrane
6 superfamily member 2 polymorphisms), visceral
adipose tissue accumulation, dietary intake and the gut
microbiome. Emerging data also suggest that NAFLD
may be a risk factor for colonic neoplasia and reduced
bone mineral density, especially among men.
Importantly, improvement/resolution of NAFLD is
associated with a reduced incidence of T2DM and
improved kidney function, adding weight to causality
and suggesting liver focused treatments may reduce risk
of extrahepatic complications. Awareness of these
associations is important for the clinicians such that CVD
risk factor management, screening for T2DM and CKD
are part of the routine management of patients with
NAFLD.
INTRODUCTION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very
common pathological condition worldwide that is
closely associated with the clinical features of meta￾bolic syndrome and is characterised by substantial
interpatient variability in severity and rate of liver
disease progression.1 2
A purely liver-centric view is that NAFLD re￾presents a spectrum of progressive liver disease
occurring in the absence of excessive alcohol con￾sumption that ranges from isolated intrahepatic tri￾glyceride accumulation (simple steatosis), through
intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation plus inflam￾mation and hepatocyte injury (non-alcoholic steato￾hepatitis, NASH), and ultimately progresses to
fibrosis/cirrhosis and potentially hepatocellular car￾cinoma.3 Although a significant proportion of the
population has NAFLD, only a minority progresses
to advanced liver disease or liver-related death.3
However, this liver-centric view does not encom￾pass the wider ramifications of NAFLD. Indeed,
NAFLD is just one facet of a multisystem disease
(figure 1) that confers substantially increased mor￾bidity and mortality on those patients who are
affected and where the most common causes of
death are cardiovascular disease (CVD), followed
by extrahepatic malignancies and liver-related
complications.4 5
This review mainly focuses on the principle
extrahepatic chronic diseases associated with
NAFLD where there is now strongest evidence for
a potential causal link: CVD, type 2 diabetes melli￾tus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD)1 2 and,
to a lesser extent, certain types of extrahepatic
tumours and osteoporosis.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA LINKING NAFLD TO
RISK OF CVD
That NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of
CVD is unsurprising, given the close associations
between NAFLD and the established CVD risk
factors encapsulated by the metabolic syndrome,
including abdominal obesity, hypertension, athero￾genic dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance/dysgly￾caemia.6–8 Highlighting the intimacy of these
associations is the observation that the increases in
hepatic lipid accumulation are directly proportional
to the severity of each component of the metabolic
syndrome.9 However, the nature and extent of
these associations, whether simply due to a shared
underlying aetiology or because the presence of
NAFLD confers an additional risk, remains the
subject of much scrutiny. This attention is undoubt￾edly warranted as it has important clinical implica￾tions for screening and surveillance strategies in the
growing number of patients with NAFLD.
Addressing CVD risk in patients with NAFLD is
also the aspect of the disease most amenable to
medical management and so improving long-term
clinical outcomes.
Beyond the associations with traditional CVD
risk factors, patients with NAFLD also exhibit a
range of non-traditional CVD risk factors, including
hyperuricaemia,10–12 hypoadiponectinaemia13–15
and hypovitaminosis D.16 The association with
CKD, discussed later in this review, also confers an
increased risk of CVD.17 Other potentially contrib￾uting risk factors include increased levels of circu￾lating proinflammatory markers (eg, C reactive
protein, interleukin (IL) 6, tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α and other hepatic acute-phase proteins),
procoagulant factors (eg, fibrinogen and plasmino￾gen activator inhibitor-1) and adhesion molecules

(eg, vascular adhesion protein-1) that are likely to have been
synthesised within the liver, especially in the presence of
NASH.18–23
Substantial epidemiological evidence links NAFLD with
objectively assessed subclinical atherosclerosis and with an
increased prevalence of clinically manifest CVD. In case-control
studies, NAFLD has been linked with increased carotid artery
intima-media thickness,24–28 increased arterial wall stiffness,29 30
and impaired endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilata￾tion.31 32 Similarly, a meta-analysis of seven cross-sectional
studies totalling 3497 individuals concluded that ultrasound￾diagnosed NAFLD was strongly associated with greater
carotid-artery intimal medial thickness and an increased preva￾lence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques.33 These findings have
since been supported by a larger meta-analysis that incorporated
27 studies and confirmed the association of NAFLD with
various markers of subclinical atherosclerosis (including also
increased coronary-artery calcium score) independent of trad￾itional CVD risk factors and metabolic syndrome features.34
Individuals with NAFLD among an occupational cohort of over
10 000 South Korean people had an increased coronary-artery
calcium score, independent of multiple CVD risk factors,
including insulin resistance.35 Case-control studies have also
reported strong associations of NAFLD with early changes in
left ventricular morphology and/or diastolic dysfunction,36–39
impaired myocardial energy metabolism40 41 and reduced cor￾onary artery flow.42 Cohort studies in patients with biopsy￾confirmed NAFLD/NASH also clearly demonstrated that CVD
is the most common cause of death.4 5
Population-based cohort studies, such as the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III), also provide
evidence of increased CVD prevalence in NAFLD. In approxi￾mately 11 500 adult NHANES participants, NAFLD (diagnosed
by ultrasonography) remained significantly associated with an
increased prevalence of CVD after adjusting for major demo￾graphic, clinical and metabolic confounders.43 44 An Italian
study in nearly 3000 outpatients with T2DM also demonstrated
that those with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD had a higher
prevalence of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular
disease, independent of traditional CVD risk factors, diabetes￾related variables and other potential confounders.45 Among
patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography,
the presence of NAFLD also independently correlated with the
severity of coronary artery disease.46–48 Recently, a systematic
review and meta-analysis incorporating almost 165 000 partici￾pants in 34 studies (21 cross-sectional, 13 cohort studies) has
provided further support for the association of NAFLD (diag￾nosed by biochemistry, imaging or histology) with atheroscler￾osis, hypertension and both prevalent and incident CVD.49
Based on the available data, there seems little doubt that
NAFLD is associated with increased CVD prevalence, an associ￾ation that has been consistently replicated across different
patient populations. Whether NAFLD is an independent CVD
risk factor or simply a bystander that shares common aetio￾logical factors remains controversial.3 However, there is a
growing body of evidence demonstrating that CVD is a clinical
concern in NAFLD, and that patients with NAFLD are more
likely to experience a CVD-related death than a liver-related
death.4 5 Although some studies suggested that only patients
with NASH rather than those with simple steatosis have an
increased CVD mortality compared with the matched control
population,50 51 a subsequent meta-analysis brought this into
question. In that meta-analysis patients with NAFLD (as
detected by histology or ultrasonography) had a substantially
greater risk of CVD mortality than the matched control
population but presence of NASH did not further increase
risk of CVD mortality.52 Further prospective studies in
patients with biopsy-characterised NAFLD are needed to
address this point, although some studies with a sufficiently
long follow-up recently showed that fibrosis stage rather than
NASH best predicts long-term survival outcomes of patients
with NAFLD.4 5
Several studies support an association between NAFLD and
incident CVD. Recent retrospective cohort studies reported a
significant association between ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD
and the progression of subclinical coronary or carotid

atherosclerosis independent of multiple CVD risk factors. The
risk of subclinical carotid/coronary atherosclerosis progression
was also higher among patients with NAFLD with increased
non-invasive markers of advanced fibrosis at baseline (NAFLD
fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 score or elevated γ-glutamyl
transferase levels).53 54 Additionally, the regression of NAFLD
on ultrasound over time was associated with a decreased risk of
subclinical carotid atherosclerosis development.53
The presence of NAFLD at baseline, although defined clinic￾ally using the calculated fatty liver index (FLI), conferred an OR
of 1.63 for subsequent development of carotid atherosclerotic
plaques in a cohort of 1872 European patients.55 Recent data
also support a bidirectional association between incident
NAFLD and CVD risk factors. After controlling for potential
confounding factors, including alcohol consumption, in 1051
participants of the Framingham Heart Study, individuals with
NAFLD at baseline were more likely to subsequently develop
incident hypertension and T2DM than those without NAFLD;
conversely, those with metabolic risk factors (hypertriglyceridae￾mia, hypertension or T2DM) at baseline were more likely to
develop incident NAFLD.56 These findings are also consistent
with natural history studies of patients with NAFLD with serial
liver biopsies where those with occurrence of incident T2DM
or hypertension between biopsies were most likely to exhibit
progressive liver fibrosis.1 2 A large number of observational
studies also suggest that NAFLD is predictive of incident CVD
events and death.4 50 51 57–67 Table 1 lists the principal retro￾spective and prospective studies that have addressed the relation￾ship between NAFLD (defined radiologically or histologically)
and risk of CVD events. Many of these studies were also
included in an updated meta-analysis that incorporated a total
of 16 unique, observational studies with 34 043 adults and cap￾tured nearly 2600 CVD outcomes over a median of 6.9-year
follow-up.68 This meta-analysis concluded that the presence of
NAFLD (diagnosed by imaging or histology) conferred an OR
of 1.64 for fatal and non-fatal incident CVD events, a risk that
appeared to increase further with greater severity of NAFLD
and remained significant in only those studies where analysis
was fully adjusted for potentially confounding covariates.68
However, some of these studies have suggested that the increase
in CVD risk may be limited to subgroups of patients with
NAFLD, such as those with advanced fibrosis,57 T2DM58 or
men with an elevated γ-glutamyl transferase level.58 It is, there￾fore, conceivable that additional factors may modify the associ￾ation between NAFLD and risk of CVD events. One such
modifying factor may be genetic variation.
Advances in our understanding of how genetic modifiers
influence disease progression through genome-wide association
studies are also relevant and have provided important insights
into the crosstalk between NAFLD and CVD and how they may
become dissociated.69 Although the widely validated single
nucleotide polymorphism, rs738409 (c.444 C>G, p.I148M) in
patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3)
confers an increased risk of NASH, hepatic fibrosis and hepato￾cellular carcinoma, it has no apparent effect on CVD risk.70–72
However, further well designed prospective studies are needed
to better clarify this controversial issue.70–73 Recently, another
non-synonymous genetic variant within a gene of unknown
function called transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2,
TM6SF2 (rs58542926 c.449 C>T, p.E167K), has been linked
with NAFLD.74 As with PNPLA3, carriage of the TM6SF2
minor (T) allele is associated with greater hepatic steatosis, more
severe NASH and greater hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis,75 76 but
intriguingly, carriage of the more common major (C) allele
promotes very low density lipoprotein excretion, conferring an
increased risk of dyslipidaemia and CVD.76 77 Thus, while in
general NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of CVD,
carriage of specific genetic modifiers might mean that these may
become dissociated. In what has been described as the ‘catch-22
paradigm’, individuals that possess the TM6SF2 minor (T) allele
will be more prone to liver-related morbidity, while those that
carry the more common (C) allele may be at greater risk of
CVD.78 Whether the strength of this effect is sufficient to over￾come the effects of many other environmental or genetic var￾iants that influence outcome(s) and so be clinically relevant at
an individual level does however remain to be definitely deter￾mined.78 The relatively new field of epigenetics research is also
providing exciting insights into the role of DNA methylation in
the pathogenesis of NAFLD and how gene-environment interac￾tions may influence CVD.79–82
Accumulating evidence also suggests that NAFLD is linked
with valvular heart diseases (ie, aortic-valve sclerosis or mitral
annulus calcification) and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias
(mainly atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias) that
may partly contribute to explain the increased risk of CVD
events observed in patients with NAFLD.83–87
Overall, therefore, the available evidence demonstrates the
strong association between NAFLD and CVD and supports the
view that NAFLD increases CVD risk: a relationship that may
be modified by a range of factors including genetic variation.
This has important clinical implications that may influence
the decision to institute primary prevention strategies with
lipid-lowering, antihypertensive or antiplatelet agents. At
present, algorithms such as the Framingham risk equation or the
Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk charts for
CVD risk assessment are used to guide initiation of preventative
interventions. However, they are based on traditional CVD risk
factors and do not include presence of NAFLD. Although the
Framingham risk equation has been validated for use in patients
with NAFLD,88 it remains unclear whether the addition of
NAFLD as a predictive factor in this or other CVD risk score
systems can improve their ability to accurately predict future
CVD events. Moreover, randomised clinical trials with CVD
outcomes that focus on treatments for liver disease in NAFLD
are also required in order to definitely establish a causal relation￾ship between NAFLD and risk of CVD events.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA LINKING NAFLD TO RISK OF CKD
Over the past decade, several population-based and hospital￾based studies have shown that the prevalence of CKD (defined
as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/
1.73 m2
, abnormal albuminuria or overt proteinuria) was mark￾edly increased in patients with NAFLD as diagnosed by
imaging89–98 or histology.99–103 In these studies, the prevalence
of CKD ranged from approximately 20% to 55% among
patients with NAFLD compared with 5% to 30% among those
without NAFLD.89–103 Notably, in most of these studies the sig￾nificant association between NAFLD and CKD persisted after
adjustment for hypertension, T2DM and other known risk
factors for CKD. Pan et al recently reported that after adjust￾ment for visceral fat accumulation and other cardiometabolic
risk factors, there was a positive, graded relationship between
intrahepatic triglyceride content, as measured by magnetic res￾onance spectroscopy, and the presence of CKD or abnormal
albuminuria in obese individuals.97 In a population-based study
of 8270 Chinese adults with normal kidney function, NAFLD
was independently associated with low levels of albuminuria
also, defined as urine albumin/creatinine ratio below 30 mg/

g.104 The finding of a strong association between NAFLD and
early kidney dysfunction (ie, microalbuminuria or eGFR
<90 mL/min/1.73 m2
) has been also documented in a cohort of
nearly 600 overweight or obese children.98 Recognition of this
kidney dysfunction in childhood is clinically important because
the treatment to reverse it is more likely to be effective if
applied early in the disease process. Interestingly, some case￾control studies that used liver biopsy to diagnose NAFLD also
reported a significant, graded relationship between the severity
of NAFLD histology and the presence of either decreased eGFR
or abnormal albuminuria.99–103 For example, in a case-control
study, we found that patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH had
a greater prevalence of abnormal albuminuria and CKD than
matched control subjects without hepatic steatosis, and that the
histological severity of NASH was independently associated
with decreasing mean eGFR values (figure 2).99 That said, it is
important to underline that none of the abovementioned studies
have used renal biopsy to examine the pathology of the CKD;
so, it remains currently unknown if NAFLD is associated with a
specific type of kidney disease (though it is very likely that
NAFLD contributes to kidney damage mainly through acceler￾ated atherogenesis).89–103
Although the cross-sectional associations between NAFLD
and CKD stages are strong and consistent across a wide range of
patient populations, the data on whether NAFLD per se is caus￾ally linked to the development and progression of CKD remain
debateable.105 106
In an occupational cohort of nearly 8500 non-diabetic and
non-hypertensive South Korean men with preserved kidney
function and no overt proteinuria at baseline who were followed
up for a mean period of 3.2 years, NAFLD (diagnosed by ultra￾sonography) was associated with an increased incidence of CKD
(HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.0).107 This association remained sig￾nificant after adjusting for body mass index (BMI), blood pres￾sure, insulin resistance, plasma C reactive protein and other
potential confounding factors.107 Similarly, in the Valpolicella
Heart Diabetes Study, involving 1760 patients with type 2 dia￾betes with preserved kidney function who were followed up
over a 6.5-year period, the presence of NAFLD on ultrasonog￾raphy was associated with an increased incidence of CKD (HR
1.69; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.6) independently of traditional cardiore￾nal risk factors, diabetes-related variables and medication use.108
Consistent with these findings, in a longitudinal cohort study of
261 type 1 diabetic adults with preserved kidney function at
baseline, who were followed up for a mean period of 5.2 years,
NAFLD (diagnosed by ultrasonography) was associated with an
approximately threefold increased incidence of CKD. Figure 3
shows a Kaplan-Meier analysis of incidence curves for CKD
over the follow-up period in patients with and without NAFLD
at baseline.109 Notably, measurement of NAFLD improved risk
prediction for CKD in this patient cohort, independently of
traditional cardiorenal risk factors (age, sex, duration of dia￾betes, haemoglobin A1c, hypertension, baseline eGFR and
microalbuminuria (ie, the last two factors being the strongest
known risk factors for CKD)).109
A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 33 observa￾tional studies (including 20 cross-sectional and 13 prospective
studies and involving nearly 64 000 individuals) examined the
relationship between NAFLD and risk of CKD.110 NAFLD was
diagnosed by biochemistry, imaging or histology, and CKD as
either eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or proteinuria. The results of
this meta-analysis showed that NAFLD was associated with a
nearly twofold increase in the prevalence and incidence of
CKD. Similarly, although only a few studies used liver biopsy to
diagnose NAFLD, the presence of histologically confirmed
NASH was associated with an approximately 2.5-fold increased
prevalence and incidence of CKD than simple steatosis.
Moreover, the presence of advanced hepatic fibrosis was asso￾ciated with a remarkably greater prevalence and incidence of
CKD than non-advanced fibrosis. In all of these analyses, the
significant association between NAFLD and CKD persisted after
adjustment for pre-existing diabetes, hypertension and other car￾diorenal risk factors.110
In line with these observations, in a cohort of 261 patients
with biopsy-proven NASH, who were treated with lifestyle mod￾ifications for 52 weeks, Vilar-Gomez et al111 found that
improvement in histological NASH-related end points, achieved
by weight loss, was independently associated with improvement
in kidney function parameters.
Collectively, these findings provide robust evidence of a
strong association between the presence and severity of NAFLD
with the stage and risk of developing CKD. Therefore, these
findings call for a more active and systematic search for CKD in

patients with NAFLD. However, it is important to underline
that the quality of some of the published studies is limited, and
that causality remains to be definitely proven in larger clinical
trials with incident CKD outcomes that focus on treatments for
liver disease in NAFLD. Notably, all these studies used
creatinine-based equations to estimate GFR (which do not
perform well in patients with cirrhosis or severe obesity) instead
of direct GFR measurements to define CKD. Furthermore, no
detailed information was available in these studies about specific
renal pathology/morphology associated with NAFLD. Further
research is also needed to better elucidate the underlying
mechanisms by which NAFLD contributes to the development
and progression of CKD.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA LINKING NAFLD TO RISK OF
TYPE 2 DIABETES
Obesity and insulin resistance are key pathogenic factors for
NAFLD and T2DM, and thus these two diseases commonly
coexist; NAFLD is present in up to 75% of patients with
T2DM, whereas the prevalence of T2DM in adults with
NAFLD is approximately 10%–18%.112–114 In the absence of
T2DM, NAFLD is a marker of insulin resistance independent of
obesity or visceral adiposity, and predicts a greater deterioration
in insulin sensitivity with weight gain compared with matched
non-NAFLD individuals.115 Concomitant with these mechanis￾tic observations, there is now robust evidence from observa￾tional studies demonstrating an increased risk of incident
T2DM following a diagnosis of NAFLD. It is also notable that,
in dual biopsy studies, the development of incident T2DM was
the strongest predictor of progression to NASH and liver
fibrosis.1
A significant association between mildly elevated serum liver
enzymes and increased risk of incident T2DM was described
nearly two decades ago.116 A meta-analysis of 20 observational
studies (involving a total of 117 000 subjects belonging to differ￾ent ethnic groups) found a 1.6–2.0-fold increased risk of inci￾dent T2DM when comparing the highest versus the lowest
quartiles of serum aminotransferase levels over a median
follow-up of 5 years.117 Nevertheless, serum aminotransferase
levels are relatively insensitive markers of NAFLD. Predictive
non-invasive scores, such as the FLI or the NAFLD fatty liver
score, incorporate serum liver enzymes with various metabolic
variables, such as BMI and serum triglyceride levels, into their
diagnostic algorithms, resulting in greater diagnostic accuracy
for NAFLD than serum liver enzymes alone. Both of these non￾invasive scores have been demonstrated to predict incident
T2DM, however it is difficult to distinguish whether it is
NAFLD itself or the metabolic variables within these scores,
which are responsible for the increased T2DM risk.118
More robust evidence of the existence of an association
between NAFLD and incident T2DM arises from multiple large
cohort studies with a median follow-up period of at least
5 years that used ultrasonography or, less commonly, CT to
diagnose NAFLD (table 2). After adjusting for several potential
confounding factors, NAFLD has been associated with a 1.5–
2-fold increased risk of new-onset T2DM over a 5–10-year
follow-up period.119–129 It is notable that the increased T2DM
risk associated with NAFLD was observed in both sexes;
however it was typically higher in men, mirroring the male pre￾dominance in T2DM.124 128 129
Notably, the risk of new-onset T2DM appears to diminish
over time following the improvement or resolution of NAFLD,
with some Asian cohort studies demonstrating T2DM incidence
returning to that of subjects without fatty liver on ultrasonog￾raphy.129–131 This is likely to be closely related to temporal
changes in body weight, although one study found NAFLD
resolution to be associated with a lower incidence of T2DM
independently of change in BMI.130 Another study found
NAFLD improvement was only associated with a reduced risk
of incident T2DM in those who had a concomitant BMI reduc￾tion over time.129
NAFLD appears to be additive to established metabolic risk
factors of obesity and insulin resistance in increasing the risk of
incident T2DM.120 127 128 132 One cohort study of 12 853 South
Korean non-diabetic individuals found that the risk of incident
T2DM over 5 years increased 2.7-fold with a baseline diagnosis
of fatty liver on ultrasound, and 3.7-fold with insulin resistance
determined by the homoeostasis model of assessment, whereas
their combination increased the risk to 6.7-fold.132 Nevertheless,
the interaction between insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome
and NAFLD is complex with several studies suggesting the associ￾ation between NAFLD and incident T2DM to be modified by
the severity of underlying insulin resistance or baseline body
weight; two studies have also found that the risk of incident

T2DM with NAFLD is limited to patients with either
baseline-impaired fasting glycaemia or those with high baseline
levels of insulin resistance.127 133 Similarly, a Finnish study of
hypertensive patients followed for 21 years found that NAFLD
was associated with an increased risk of incident T2DM when
coexisting with the metabolic syndrome, but not in its
absence.134 Surprisingly, however, two Japanese studies found
the magnitude of risk of incident T2DM to be higher in patients
who have NAFLD but are lean or have lower BMI values.121 128
This finding might be, at least in part, due to the lower sensitivity
of ultrasonography for detecting NAFLD with increasing BMI,
potentially leading to some misclassification bias.
The severity of underlying NAFLD appears to influence the
magnitude of future risk of T2DM, with increasing risk that
parallels the severity of hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography or
CT.122 125 126 Importantly, in these studies the T2DM risk asso￾ciated with NAFLD remained significant even after adjustment
for a range of common T2DM risk factors. Similarly, a Korean
study found that only patients with NAFLD with elevated
alanine-aminotransferase levels had an increased risk of incident
T2DM, which may reflect more severe hepatic steatosis or
the histologically more aggressive subtype of NASH.135
Correspondingly, patients with NASH have a higher risk of
developing T2DM compared with those with simple steatosis,
although it is not clear whether this risk is independent of con￾founding factors such as obesity.50 Lastly, after stratification of
patients with NAFLD according to likelihood of advanced
hepatic fibrosis by the NFS, those with high or intermediate
NFS values are more than twice as likely to develop T2DM
than those with low NFS values.119 Although there is now con￾vincing evidence that NAFLD is strongly associated with the
risk of incident CKD in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
(as discussed previously), it remains unclear whether NAFLD
or NASH are also independent risk factors for diabetic retinop￾athy (another microvascular complication of diabetes), with
evidence limited only to cross-sectional studies with conflicting
conclusions.89 136
It is important to underline that the majority of observational
studies that examined the relationship between NAFLD and risk
of incident T2DM are retrospective and originate from Asia
where large populations undergo regular health check-ups
including liver ultrasonography. Only one study from the USA
found CT-determined hepatic steatosis to be independently asso￾ciated with increased risk of incident T2DM in a population
that included Caucasians, Blacks and Hispanics; however
whether this risk differs according to race is unknown as a strati￾fied analysis was not performed.126 Additionally, as Asian and
non-Asian populations have different adipose tissue distributions
and cultural/genetic backgrounds, further evidence is needed in
different ethnic and racial groups. Finally, the study by Ming
et al123 was the only one in which the diagnosis of diabetes was
also based on 2-hour postload plasma glucose levels.
Currently, it is unclear whether NAFLD is causally related to
T2DM development or is simply a marker of other shared risk
factors, such as visceral adipose tissue. Notably, some genetic
conditions leading to intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation,
such as familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia, do not lead to
increased insulin resistance, and genetic polymorphisms in the
PNPLA3 gene (that also correlate with higher intrahepatic trigly￾ceride content and increased risk of NASH, but are not systemat￾ically associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome
features) only appear to associate with T2DM in the presence of
obesity, suggesting that other factors in addition to hepatic stea￾tosis are important for the development of T2DM.69 137 138
Despite the above caveats, a large number of cohort studies
clearly demonstrated NAFLD to be associated with an approxi￾mate doubling of risk of incident T2DM. This association
appears to be dose-dependent and is ameliorated with NAFLD
improvement or resolution over time. Consequently, current
clinical guidelines recommend routine screening of patients with
NAFLD for T2DM with fasting blood glucose or haemoglobin
A1c levels or with a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in high-risk
groups.139
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA LINKING NAFLD TO RISK OF
COLORECTAL ADENOMAS/CANCER AND OTHER
EXTRAHEPATIC NEOPLASMS
Patients with NAFLD typically have a range of metabolic risk
factors associated with the development of neoplasia, including
T2DM and obesity; consequently, extrahepatic malignancy is
the second most common cause of death among patients with
NAFLD.4 5 In addition, one community-based cohort study of
patients with T2DM suggested that NAFLD was associated with
an increased risk of death from malignancy, suggesting an inde￾pendent effect of NAFLD over and above coexisting metabolic
risk factors.140
The strongest association between NAFLD and extrahepatic
neoplasia has been reported with colorectal adenomas (as
summarised in table 3). One Taiwanese study of 1522 indivi￾duals found a diagnosis of NAFLD in subjects with a normal
baseline colonoscopy was associated with a 45% increased risk
of future adenoma on subsequent colonoscopy 5 years later.141
This association remained significant after adjustment for age,
sex, smoking and metabolic risk factors. Two subsequent
meta-analyses of five observational studies each, demonstrated a
1.5–1.7-fold increased risk of colorectal adenomas.142 143
NAFLD was also associated with multiple colorectal adenomas
(≥3) and a tendency towards proximal lesions (right-sided
colonic adenomas). Whether the risk of colorectal adenoma
increases with NASH compared with simple steatosis is unclear
with two relatively small cross-sectional studies demonstrating
conflicting results.144 145 Recently, a large cross-sectional study
of 26 540 asymptomatic individuals from South Korea however,
found the risk for any colorectal neoplasia and advanced colo￾rectal neoplasia to be particularly increased in patients with
NAFLD with high NFS or other non-invasive fibrosis scores.146
The risk of developing colorectal cancer also appears to be
increased, with two large cohort studies of Korean and Chinese
individuals undergoing colonoscopy (n=2315 and n=5517,
respectively) finding a diagnosis of NAFLD on ultrasound to be
significantly associated with an increased cancer risk of 1.87
(95% CI 1.4 to 2.6) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.02 to 9.3), respect￾ively.147 148 Preliminary reports have also linked NAFLD with
the occurrence of gastric and prostate cancers149, however
further data are required before any definitive conclusions can be
made. Further research is also needed to establish whether risk of
these extrahepatic cancers differs with severity of NAFLD.
Nevertheless, the studies to date have been predominately
cross-sectional, limiting any inference about causality and
largely restricted to Asian populations. Currently, although a
diagnosis of NAFLD is not sufficient to recommend screening
colonoscopy, evaluation of colonic symptoms and ensuring
patients are enrolled in colorectal cancer screening programmes
as per recommendations for the general population is strongly
recommended. Further evidence is needed to clarify the risk in
patients aged 40–50 years who are not currently within routine
screening guidelines. However, if the potential adverse impact
of NAFLD on risk of colorectal adenomas/cancer will be

confirmed in future large-scale prospective studies, there may be
significant implications for screening and surveillance strategies
given the growing number of patients with NAFLD.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA LINKING NAFLD TO RISK OF
OSTEOPOROSIS
NAFLD is associated with multiple factors linked to decreased
bone mineral density (BMD), including T2DM, obesity, insulin
resistance, chronic inflammation, vitamin D3 deficiency and low
levels of physical activity.150 Consequently, several cross-sectional
and case-control studies involving both adults and adolescents
have found a significant association between low BMD or osteo￾porosis and NAFLD 150. Worryingly, this association has been
also reported in the paediatric age group, with one study of 38
obese children with biopsy-proven NAFLD reporting signifi￾cantly lower BMD compared with 38 non-steatotic children
matched for age, sex, ethnicity and BMI.151 The degree of BMD
fell with increasing severity of liver disease with patients with
NASH having a lower level than those with simple steatosis.
In adults, the association between NAFLD and osteoporosis
is less consistent, with a meta-analysis of a total of 1276
individuals finding no significant differences in BMD between sub￾jects with or without NAFLD, whereas a significant association
with BMI was found.152 Significant heterogeneity between studies
however, limits conclusions from this meta-analysis. Subsequently,
three large cohort studies totalling over 2500 individuals, all
found a significant inverse association between BMD and NAFLD,
although interestingly the association was limited to men and not
seen in postmenopausal women.153–155 The association between
NAFLD and BMD was modest, however, and remained significant
in these studies even after adjusting for several potential confound￾ing factors, including age, weight, alcohol intake, smoking and
metabolic risk factors. Increasing ultrasonographic severity of
hepatic steatosis as well as serum alanine-aminotransferase levels
correlated inversely with BMD.153 A further cohort study of 7797
Chinese adults aged >40 years confirms the existence of a sex￾specific association with a higher rate of recent osteoporotic frac￾tures in men with NAFLD compared with those without (3.6% vs
1.7%, p=0.003), with no difference seen in women.156 Overall,
men with NAFLD had a 2.5-fold increased risk of recent osteopor￾otic fractures even after adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol
intake, physical activity, metabolic risk factors, kidney function
and use of glucocorticoids or osteoporosis medications.156 The
male-specific association suggests a sex-specific interaction
between hepatic steatosis and bone metabolism, or that other
factors in women, such as oestrogen status, may dominate the risk
of osteoporosis.
Collectively, these findings argue for awareness of BMD
among patients with NAFLD. However, it is important to note
that the available data are limited to cross-sectional studies
largely from Asian populations. The majority of studies focus on
BMD rather than bone fracture rate and further evidence is
required to clarify whether patients with NAFLD (in particular
men) should be screened for osteoporosis.
PUTATIVE MECHANISMS LINKING NAFLD TO
EXTRAHEPATIC CONDITIONS
Extrahepatic pathological conditions in NAFLD are closely
linked to the presence of local (ie, in the liver, adipose tissue,
vessels and heart) and systemic inflammation. Chronic low-grade
inflammation accompanies many metabolic disorders, such as
T2DM or NAFLD.157 It has been demonstrated that inflamma￾tory pathways such as IL-1-type cytokines are driving forces of
disease processes in NAFLD and correlate with prognosis of
liver disease.158 159 Hepatic inflammation might be responsible
for the overall degree of hepatic fibrosis and thereby prognosis
of this disorder and might also control insulin resistance.
Hepatic/peripheral insulin resistance (ie, a hallmark in most
patients with NAFLD) and metabolic inflammation are fre￾quently observed in parallel, and research from the past has
tried to connect these two phenomena.160 The origin of chronic
inflammatory processes observed in NAFLD is still a matter of
discussion as multiple parallel ‘hits’ might control and regulate
disease process.161 Besides lipotoxicity, the GI tract with its sig￾nificantly altered microbiota could reflect one of the early events
in disease development. In addition, abdominal visceral adipose
tissue accumulation is another ‘hot’ candidate reflecting a major
site of chronic inflammation in NAFLD as adipose tissue inflam￾mation is commonly observed in obesity, T2DM and NAFLD.
Indeed, it has been shown that the inflamed (‘dysfunctional’)
adipose tissue in obesity might generate almost 50% of circulat￾ing IL-6 thereby contributing substantially to systemic chronic
inflammation.162 The importance of visceral adipose tissue as
site of chronic inflammation is further supported by some
studies demonstrating that the lack of adipocyte 50
AMP-activated protein kinase worsens insulin resistance and
liver disease by affecting brown and beige adipose tissue func￾tion.163 Additionally, adipose tissue-specific insulin receptor
knockout mice develop more severe NAFLD with histological
evidence of ballooning degeneration further supporting the
notion that the adipose tissue is of key importance in the devel￾opment and progression of NAFLD.164 In contrast, recent
research has found that adipose tissue type I interferon signal￾ling may protect from metabolic dysfunction.165
Nutrition and dietary factors
Nutrition is critically involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD,
besides the fact that NAFLD is mainly a disease of the obese
population. Overnutrition and certain dietary factors have been
demonstrated to induce chronic low-grade inflammation.166 167
Epidemiological studies have shown that diet can affect inflam￾matory processes and the immune system directly, and also
through interactions with the gut microbiota. Western diets are
able to promote chronic inflammatory processes by many path￾ways. A high salt content may induce IL-17 producing T helper
cells and thereby inflammation.168 Dietary fatty acids promote
inflammation through several mechanisms, including direct
effects on immune cells, activation of toll-like receptors and
cytokine cascades,169 and affect intestinal permeability.170 Mice
with a loss of junctional adhesion molecule A ( JAM-A) have a
defective intestinal epithelial barrier and exhibit more promin￾ent NASH, and colonic tissue from patients with NAFLD have
lower levels of JAM-A and higher levels of inflammation com￾pared with healthy controls.171 In healthy individuals, a high-fat
Western diet induces endotoxaemia and, therefore, might con￾tribute to the observed chronic inflammation in NAFLD.172 A
diet rich in saturated milk-derived fatty acids worsens colitis in
IL-10 deficient mice via profound changes of the gut microbiota
and an increased Th1 cell response.173 Many studies have also
associated dietary phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine con￾sumption with generation of specific metabolites (ie, trimethyla￾mine (TMA) and TMA N-oxide) and future CVD events.174
Not surprisingly, dietary interventions might be able to reverse a
Western-diet induced liver phenotype as shown, for example,
for citrulline.175 Overall, the composition of Western diets
might contribute to the development/progression of NAFLD via
generation of overweight and obesity, and induce activation of
specific inflammatory pathways.

Gut microbiota
Evidence is increasing that the gut microbiota might contribute
to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. NAFLD reflects a prototypical
disease of innate immunity and it is expected that certain bac￾teria in the intestinal tract activate various pathways of innate
immunity in the case of disease.176 In several mouse models, the
microbiota affects hepatic steatosis and fat storage. Human
studies from the past years have also supported a role for the
microbiota in NAFLD. Actinobacteria were increased whereas
Bacteroidetes were reduced dependent on liver disease activity
as demonstrated in a paediatric study population.177 At species
levels, Oscillobacter decreased in NAFLD whereas
Ruminococcus, Blautia and Dorea increased especially in
patients with NASH.177 Another study assessed the gut micro￾biota and severity of histology-proven NAFLD in 57 patients.178
Bacteroides abundance increased depending on severity of
disease, whereas Prevotella abundance decreased. Ruminococcus
abundance increased in more severe disease, especially if
advanced hepatic fibrosis was diagnosed.178 Overall, many
studies from the past years clearly highlighted a role for the gut
microbiota in obesity-related disorders supporting the assump￾tion that NASH might be associated with a ‘microbiome signa￾ture’ which could contribute to initiation of inflammation. It
has to be acknowledged, however, that these early studies are
rather descriptive and neither studies (either preclinical or clin￾ical) have so far identified certain bacterial strains, which act
proinflammatory and are indeed involved in disease pathogen￾esis. The altered microbiome in patients with NAFLD could
also be involved in the development of NAFLD-associated
malignancy both in the liver179 and in the GI tract.180
Cytokines/adipocytokines
It is well established that proinflammatory cytokines and tran￾scription factors are highly expressed in various tissues, such as
the adipose tissue or liver, in NAFLD and a large number of dif￾ferent immune cells and, especially, tissue macrophages may con￾tribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Various proinflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α or IL-6, are activated in different
tissues but especially in adipose tissue and in the liver of patients
with NAFLD/NASH.181 There is substantial evidence that activa￾tion of the transcription of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and down￾stream inflammatory signalling pathways are involved in
metabolic liver inflammation and associated hepatic insulin resist￾ance.182 183 Receptor activator of NF-κB, a prototypical activator
of NF-κB, regulates hepatic insulin sensitivity.184 Deletion of
hepatic MyD88 results in liver inflammation and hepatic insulin
resistance also affecting the gut microbiota composition and
metabolome.185 Therefore, several studies using hepatocyte￾specific targeting of genes have now strongly supported the
notion that hepatocytes are major metabolic ‘players’ in the
development of metabolic inflammation in and beyond the liver.
Chronic inflammation and cytokine activation is a driving
force in the evolution of malignancy and, therefore, it is
expected that patients with NAFLD exhibit a high rate of liver
and extrahepatic malignancies.144 186 Chronic IL-6 overexpres￾sion has been found to result in the generation of liver
tumours.187 In these studies, the development of obesity￾promoted hepatocellular carcinoma was dependent on enhanced
production of the tumour-promoting cytokines IL-6 and
TNF-α, which cause hepatic inflammation and activation of the
oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. Besides several cytokines
certain adipocytokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, might
contribute to systemic inflammatory processes and associated
pathologies in NAFLD.188 189 For example, NAFLD is asso￾ciated with hypoadiponectinaemia and lower adiponectin levels
correlate with colorectal cancer/adenoma incidence.190 191
Low-level plasma adiponectin is especially associated with
KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer risk.192 Therefore, it may be
concluded that chronic activation of cytokine/adipocytokine cas￾cades as observed in NAFLD might contribute substantially to
the extrahepatic chronic diseases observed in NAFLD ranging
from CVD to osteoporosis and especially also hepatic and extra￾hepatic cancers.
CONCLUSIONS
This review further reinforces the view that NAFLD is a multi￾system disease that affects many extrahepatic organ systems and
interacts with the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways.
NAFLD is associated with liver-related morbidity and mortality,
and with an increased risk of developing important extrahepatic
chronic diseases, such as CVD, T2DM and CKD. Emerging
data also suggest NAFLD may be a risk factor for colonic aden￾omas/cancer and decreased BMD, particularly among men.
Clear evidence indicates that CVD is the leading cause of death
in patients with NAFLD. This implies that patients with
NAFLD should undergo careful cardiovascular surveillance. In
line with this implication, given that CVD complications dictate
the outcome(s) in patients with NAFLD more frequently and to
a greater extent than does the progression of liver disease, the
recent European clinical practice guidelines have recommended
CVD risk assessment in all patients with NAFLD.139
There is a growing body of epidemiological and experimental
evidence suggesting that NAFLD, especially its necroinflamma￾tory form, exacerbates hepatic/peripheral insulin resistance, pre￾disposes to atherogenic dyslipidaemia and releases a variety of
proinflammatory, procoagulant, thrombogenic and profibrogenic
factors that may promote the development of CVD, CKD,
T2DM and other extrahepatic chronic diseases.
However, although all these mechanisms plausibly link
NAFLD to the development and progression of CVD, CKD and
other extrahepatic diseases, no studies to date have proven a
cause-and-effect relationship and further research is certainly
needed to gain mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology
linking NAFLD to the development and progression of these
extrahepatic chronic diseases.
In the meantime, we believe that the clinical implication of
these findings is that a diagnosis of NAFLD may identify a
subset of the general population, which is exposed to an
increased risk of developing some important extrahepatic
chronic diseases. Therefore, patients with NAFLD might benefit
from more intensive surveillance or early treatment interven￾tions to decrease the risk of developing CVD, CKD, T2DM and
other extrahepatic manifestations. Thus, clinicians who manage
patients with NAFLD, especially those with NASH with varying
amounts of fibrosis, should focus on liver disease, and should
recognise the increased risk of CVD, CKD, T2DM and other
serious extrahepatic manifestations of these patients, screen
them for conventional risk factors and undertake early, aggres￾sive risk factor modification(s).
