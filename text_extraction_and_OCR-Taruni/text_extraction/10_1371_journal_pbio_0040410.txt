Iron overload is known to exacerbate many infectious diseases, and conversely, iron withholding is an important
defense strategy for mammalian hosts. Iron is a critical cue for Cryptococcus neoformans because the fungus senses
iron to regulate elaboration of the polysaccharide capsule that is the major virulence factor during infection. Excess
iron exacerbates experimental cryptococcosis and the prevalence of this disease in Sub-Saharan Africa has been
associated with nutritional and genetic aspects of iron loading in the background of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We
demonstrate that the iron-responsive transcription factor Cir1 in Cr. neoformans controls the regulon of genes for iron
acquisition such that cir1 mutants are ‘‘blind’’ to changes in external iron levels. Cir1 also controls the known major
virulence factors of the pathogen including the capsule, the formation of the anti-oxidant melanin in the cell wall, and
the ability to grow at host body temperature. Thus, the fungus is remarkably tuned to perceive iron as part of the
disease process, as confirmed by the avirulence of the cir1 mutant; this characteristic of the pathogen may provide
opportunities for antifungal treatment.

Introduction
The competition between host and pathogen for iron is a
critical aspect of many infectious diseases including malaria,
tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases [1,2]. The availability of
iron in host fluids is maintained at extremely low levels (1018
M) by the iron-binding proteins transferrin (Tf) and
lactoferrin (Lf). However, pathogenic microbes require 106
to 107 M iron for growth, and they must therefore steal iron
from host proteins by binding ferrated Tf or Lf, elaborating
siderophores, or degrading hemoglobin or other iron￾containing proteins. Iron overload due to genetic predis￾position, therapeutic intervention, or nutritional status is
known to increase the risk of infection by many pathogens
such as HIV, Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
and the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [1,2].
Cr. neoformans is a basidiomycetous yeast that causes life￾threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised
patients [3]. The major virulence factors of the two well￾characterized varieties neoformans (capsule serotype D) and
grubii (capsule serotype A) include the production of a
polysaccharide capsule, the deposition of melanin in the cell
wall, and the ability to grow at 37 8C. Acapsular mutants are
avirulent, and the capsule has a variety of immunomodula￾tory affects, including inhibition of phagocytosis [4–8].
Capsule size is influenced by iron and CO2 levels, growth in
serum, and host tissue location [9–12]. Melanin also influen￾ces phagocytosis and mediates resistance to oxidative stress
[13]. The phenoloxidase (laccase) for melanin synthesis is
required for virulence and is regulated by iron [14–16].
Tolerance to host temperature is also required for virulence,
and the role of calcineurin in this phenotype has been well
characterized [17–20].
Among fungi, iron transport and regulation are best
understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [21]. Iron uptake is
mediated by a high-affinity iron transport pathway in which
ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron by cell surface
reductases (Fre1 and Fre2) and subsequently transported by
the high-affinity iron permease/multicopper ferroxidase
complex (Ftr1–Fet3). These and other components of the
iron regulon are regulated by the transcriptional activators
Aft1 and Aft2 [22,23]. Other fungi use transcriptional
repressors to regulate the expression of iron-responsive
genes [24]. Examples include Fep1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
Sfu1 in Candida albicans, and Urbs1 in Ustilago maydis. These
proteins possess conserved cysteine-rich regions and two zinc
finger motifs characteristic of GATA-type transcription
factors in higher eukaryotes. Indeed, Fep1 and Urbs1 bind
59-GATA-39 sequences in the promoters of genes encoding
high-affinity iron transporters, as well as siderophore
production and transport functions [25–27]. Cr. neoformans is
thought to acquire iron by both high- and low-affinity iron

uptake systems mediated by cell surface reductases [28].
Nonenzymatic reduction of ferric iron by 3-hydroxylanthra￾nilic acid and melanin has also been documented [29].
Genome-wide analysis of the response to low iron conditions
using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) revealed that
orthologs of many of the Sa. cerevisiae iron regulon genes (e.g.,
FTR1, FET3, and FRE1) are regulated by iron in Cr. neoformans
[30,31]. However, regulators of iron-responsive genes have
not yet been identified for Cr. neoformans.
In general, the regulatory mechanisms influencing iron
transport and homeostasis are poorly understood in patho￾genic fungi. Here we report the discovery of a gene that
encodes a major transcriptional regulator of the response to
iron in Cr. neoformans. This gene, CIR1 (Cryptococcus iron
regulator), shares structural and functional features with
other fungal GATA-type transcription factors for iron
regulation. For example, mutants lacking CIR1 have elevated
cell surface reductase activity as well as increased sensitivity
to iron and phleomycin. Microarray analysis confirmed that
CIR1 influences the transcription of iron transport and
homeostasis functions, as well as genes for calcium and cAMP
signaling, and cell wall integrity. Parallel genetic analysis
revealed that CIR1 also controls the expression of all known
virulence functions including capsule, melanin, and growth at
host temperature. A similar link between iron and the
expression of virulence factors (e.g., diphtheria toxin) occurs
in bacterial pathogens [32,33], but the global association
between iron and virulence in Cr. neoformans is remarkable. A
cir1 mutant was attenuated for virulence in a murine model
of cryptococcosis, thus supporting the idea that iron
regulation in Cr. neoformans, and perhaps in other fungi, is a
promising target for antifungal therapy.
Results
Identification and Mutation of the Cryptococcus Iron
Regulator, CIR1
We initially used the sequences of the known fungal iron
regulators Fep1, Urbs1, and Sfu1 to identify a candidate iron
regulator, CIR1, in the genomes of serotype D and A strains of
Cr. neoformans [31]. Sequences related to the Sa. cerevisiae Aft1
polypeptide were not found. A single copy of CIR1 was
identified in the serotype D and A strains, and these genes
encoded predicted polypeptides of 963 (serotype D) and 952
(serotype A) amino acids (aa) with 93.4% aa identity. The Cir1
sequence was aligned with the fungal GATA-type iron
regulators and found to share a zinc finger motif and a
cysteine-rich domain (Figure 1A). However, unlike the other
fungal iron regulators that have two zinc finger motifs, Cir1
contained only one zinc finger motif (the C-terminal motif),
suggesting it may have different properties compared to
other fungal iron regulators. We deleted the entire CIR1
coding region in strains representing the D (strain B3501A)
and A (strain H99) serotypes and found that the resulting cir1

mutants were viable and had similar doubling times in YPD
medium at 30 8C compared to wild-type cells (unpublished
data). The cir1 mutations in each strain were also comple￾mented by integration of the wild-type gene of each serotype
at the CIR1 locus. The absence of CIR1 transcript in the
mutants was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1B).
Cir1 Mutants Have Iron-Related Phenotypes
The cir1 mutants were tested for iron-related phenotypes,
including cell surface reductase activity, as well as sensitivity
to iron and the iron-dependent inhibitor phleomycin. In Sc.
pombe, loss of the transcriptional repressor Fep1 results in
elevated cell surface reductase activity, which appears as a
red colony color on media with triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) [26]. As expected, colonies of the cir1
mutants also showed an enhanced red color compared with
wild-type strains, indicating higher cell surface reductase
activity, presumably due to derepression of reductase gene
transcription. The mutants complemented with CIR1 had
the wild-type phenotype, indicating that the increased
reductase activity was due to deletion of CIR1 (Figure 1C).
Excess iron is potentially damaging because it can catalyze
the formation of reactive oxygen species via the Haber￾Weiss/Fenton reaction [34]. Additionally, the glycopeptide
antibiotic phleomycin causes DNA damage in the presence
of ferrous iron and oxygen due to the production of
reactive species, and sreA and fep1 mutants of Aspergillus
nidulans and Sc. pombe, respectively, showed increased
sensitivity to the drug [26,35–37]. In this regard, we found
that the cir1 mutants displayed sensitivity to excess iron and
to phleomycin, indicating that CIR1 is required for iron
homeostasis (Figure 1C). As described below, the cir1
mutants also displayed virulence-related phenotypes, includ￾ing poor growth at 37 8C, loss of capsule formation, and
altered melanin production. Taken together, these results
linked Cir1 to iron-related phenotypes and virulence, thus
warranting an examination of the influence of cir1 mutation
on transcription.
Cir1 Plays a Major Role in the Transcriptional Regulation of
Iron-Responsive Genes
For microarray experiments, wild-type and mutant strains
were grown in low- or high-iron medium to analyze the
transcriptional changes influenced by iron and by deletion
of CIR1. A loop design was used with microarrays containing
70-mer oligonucleotides for 7,738 genes of the serotype D
strain JEC21 (arrays are currently available only for this
strain). We found that 733 genes were differentially ex￾pressed more than 2-fold in the wild-type strain (based on
Q-value statistics). Among these, 483 genes were down￾regulated, and 250 genes were up-regulated in low-iron
versus high-iron medium, including genes related to iron
transport and homeostasis, such as the high-affinity iron
permease (FTR1) and the siderophore transporter (SIT1). In
general, there was good agreement with the genes found to
be regulated by iron in our previous SAGE study [30]. In
contrast to the situation with wild-type cells, there were no
differentially expressed genes with statistical significance
based on q-values in the cir1 mutants in response to iron
availability (cir1D; low vs. high iron; Table 1). A less stringent
statistical evaluation based on p-values revealed a small
number of genes that showed differential expression in the
mutant in response to iron. In contrast, the comparisons
between the wild-type strain and the cir1 mutant revealed
substantial differences in the transcriptomes in both low￾iron and high-iron conditions. When the wild-type tran￾scriptome was compared to that of the cir1 mutant, 2,311
and 1,623 genes were differentially expressed in low-iron
and high-iron media, respectively. Overall, these results
indicated that Cir1 is a sensor of iron levels for Cr.
neoformans and a key regulator of the corresponding tran￾scriptional response.
We further analyzed the microarray data based on Gene
Ontology (GO) categories for the biological processes of the
differentially expressed genes, using the recently developed

data-mining tool, ermineJ [38,39]. By using a gene score re￾sampling analysis tool with all q-values from the experiments
as input scores, we asked which GO categories were most
enriched in the differentially expressed genes. The GO
terms of iron ion transporter and siderophore transporter
were the two most highly ranked groups, indicating that
these genes were the most affected by both iron availability
and disruption of CIR1 (Table 2). Thus the ermineJ analysis
supports the conclusion that Cir1 functions in iron trans￾port and homeostasis. Genes related to DNA replication,
metabolism, and repair were also among the top-ranked
groups; this is consistent with the sensitivity of the cir1
mutants to excess intracellular iron, because transition
metals such as iron are known to provoke the free
radical–induced DNA damage [40]. Additionally, genes
related to fatty acid metabolism and external encapsulated
structure were affected by iron availability and/or disruption
of CIR1, indicating (as described further below) that Cir1
has roles in membrane synthesis and cell wall integrity.
Cir1 Regulates Transcript Levels for Genes That Define the
Iron Regulon
Differentially regulated genes with GO terms related to
iron transport and siderophore transport were extracted
from the microarray data and clustered to identify candidate
Cir1 targets and patterns of regulation. We found two main
clusters of genes with higher transcript levels in response to
iron limitation in wild-type cells, a pattern consistent with
roles in iron transport (Figure 2A). Cluster I included genes
related to reductive iron uptake systems such as FTR1, FET3,
and FRE1. Transcript levels for genes in this cluster were also
higher in the cir1 mutants, suggesting negative and perhaps
direct regulation by Cir1. Interestingly, the LAC1 and LAC2
genes encoding laccase for melanin production appeared in
cluster I. This result is consistent with a potential role for
laccase/melanin in reductive iron metabolism and revealed
that Cir1 regulates one of the major virulence factors of Cr.
neoformans. Phenotypic confirmation of this result is described
below. A separate cluster (II) contained several genes for
putative siderophore transporters, including SIT1, which was
recently characterized as a siderophore transporter (K.
Tangen, W. Jung, A. Sham, T. Lian, and J. Kronstad,
unpublished data). Transcript levels for the genes in cluster
II were decreased in the cir1 mutant, especially in low-iron
medium, thus raising the possibility that Cir1 may function
both as a transcriptional repressor and an activator.
The microarray data were confirmed by RNA blot hybrid￾ization with selected genes from the serotype D strain
B3501A, and we extended the analysis to include the same
genes from the serotype A strain H99 for comparison. In
general, the expression patterns matched the results from the
microarray experiments (Figure 2B). For example, the FTR1
transcript was clearly elevated in the cir1 mutant relative to
the wild-type or reconstituted strains for both serotypes
(Figure 2B). The FRE1 and LAC1 genes showed a similar
pattern of regulation, with higher transcript levels in the cir1
mutant. These results support the placement of these genes in
cluster I (Figure 2A) and suggest that Cir1 negatively regulates
their expression. The hybridization results with SIT1 and
CIG1 (encoding an iron-regulated cell wall protein; [30])
illustrate the pattern for cluster II genes in which loss of Cir1
results in lower transcript levels. We noted that a transcript
signal was not found for the FRE1 gene from strain H99, and
this may indicate a divergence in regulation between the
strains or serotypes. It is possible that other ferric reductase
genes may be more important and more highly regulated in
strain H99 than the one chosen for this analysis. Additionally,
FTR1 and LAC1 in the cir1 mutant of H99 (serotype A), but
not in the mutant of B3501A (serotype D), clearly showed
differential regulation by iron, implying that other regulators
besides Cir1 may control their transcription and that the two
serotypes may have different regulatory mechanisms. Overall,
these results suggest that Cir1 negatively regulates expression
of the reductive iron transport pathway and positively

regulates iron-uptake systems mediated by siderophore
transporters in Cr. neoformans.
Cir1 Is Required for Elaboration of the Polysaccharide
Capsule
The polysaccharide capsule is the major virulence factor of
Cr. neoformans [11,12]. Given that iron limitation results in an
enlarged capsule, we evaluated the effect of CIR1 disruption
on capsule formation by growing cells in low-iron medium.
No capsule was visible on cells of the cir1 mutants of both the
serotype D and serotype A strains, whereas the wild-type and
reconstituted strains displayed large capsules (unpublished
data). Capsule formation was also evaluated by growing the
cells in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 8C to mimic the
mammalian host environment. Elevated CO2 is known to
induce capsule formation, but the cir1 mutants still showed
defective capsule formation under these conditions (Figure
3A). These results demonstrate that Cir1 is necessary for
capsule formation, perhaps through the regulation of genes
needed for sensing iron and CO2 levels, or for the synthesis,
transport, or attachment of capsule components.
The loss of capsule production in the cir1 mutants
prompted us to examine the microarray data for insights
into potential targets of Cir1 regulation that might account
for this phenotype. We first compiled a list of genes related to
signaling pathways and other components known to influence
capsule and virulence (Table 3). We then examined the
influence of iron and loss of Cir1 on the expression of these
genes, with particular attention to targets like the CAP and
CAS genes that are known to influence capsule formation
[11,41]. Many of these genes were differentially expressed in
the cir1 mutants, but the changes were not significant. The
CAS32 gene was the exception, with 9.77- and 11.44-fold up￾regulation in the cir1 mutants in low-iron and high-iron
media, respectively. This gene and other CAS family genes are
homologs of the CAP64 gene that is required for capsule
formation; however, the CAS genes are involved in xylose
branching and/or O acetylation of the capsule polysaccharide
rather than capsule formation per se [41]. Therefore, it is not
clear whether transcriptional changes in these capsule￾related genes caused the capsule defect in the cir1 mutants.
We also evaluated components of the cAMP pathway that
positively regulates both capsule synthesis and melanin
production in Cr. neoformans and found that transcripts for

Iron and Fungal Pathogenesis

genes encoding adenylate cyclase or the catalytic subunit of
PKA showed only subtle differences (Table 3; [42–44]).
However, expression of the upstream G protein–coupled
receptor (GPCR) Gpr4, which appears to activate Gpa1 in the
cAMP pathway [45], was significantly reduced in the cir1
mutants with 6.4- and 10.77-fold down-regulation in low-iron
and high-iron conditions, respectively, compared to wild-type
cells. Because gpr4 mutants are defective in capsule synthesis,
the loss of capsule in the cir1 mutants could be due to down￾regulation of this upstream receptor of the cAMP pathway.
To test this hypothesis, the cir1 mutants were grown in low￾iron medium containing 10 mM cAMP. This resulted in only
slight restoration of capsule formation in the cir1 mutants of
the serotype A strains (less than 20% of wild-type capsule size;
unpublished data), but not in the cir1 mutants of the serotype
D strains. Therefore, we conclude that the deficiency in
capsule synthesis of the cir1 mutants is likely caused by
alterations in other pathways in addition to the cAMP
pathway.
Melanin production and glucose sensing were shown to be
independent of Gpr4, indicating the potential involvement of
other receptors [45]. Genes for other GPCRs were also
differentially regulated in the cir1 mutants, including GPR1,
which was down-regulated in the cir1 mutants in both low￾iron and high-iron conditions, and GPR2 and GPR3, which
were up-regulated in the mutants in both conditions. No
obvious phenotypes have been associated with these genes,
and it is not clear that they influence the phenotypes of the
cir1 mutants [45]. Taken together, these data revealed that the
membrane receptors of the cAMP pathway, but not the
downstream effectors, were influenced by deletion of CIR1.
Cir1 Influences Cell Wall Integrity and Membrane
Functions
The cell wall is an important interface between Cr.
neoformans and the host, and our earlier SAGE analysis of
the response to iron limitation identified genes for wall
components [30]. We therefore tested the cir1 mutants for
sensitivity to agents that challenge cell wall integrity and
found reduced growth of the cir1 mutant in the serotype D
strain background on medium containing SDS (Figure 3B).
We also examined the microarray data and found that the
transcripts for genes encoding functions for the regulation,
synthesis, and modification of chitin and glucan were
generally increased in the cir1 mutants (Table 3). Components
of the Mpk1 (PKC1) MAPK pathway have been shown to
regulate cell wall integrity in Cr. neoformans [46,47], and our
microarray data revealed that the transcript of MPK1 was
3.46-fold up-regulated in the cir1 mutant compared to wild
type in low-iron medium. We also found a gene for another
MAP kinase (162.m02830) with high similarity to Mpk1 (55%
identity and 70% similarity) on the same chromosome
(Chromosome 9), and the transcript of this gene was
significantly higher in the cir1 mutants (6.22- and 3.21-fold
in low-iron and high-iron conditions, respectively). These
results support the idea that cell wall integrity is challenged
by loss of Cir1 (Figure 3B) and that the Mpk1 MAP kinase
pathway may be over-activated as a consequence. Compo￾Table 3. Continued

Iron and Fungal Pathogenesis

nents of other MAPK pathways in Cr. neoformans were also
examined, and we found that disruption of CIR1 caused
increased transcript levels for two components of the mating
pathway: CPK1 and STE11a (an upstream MPKKK of Cpk1).
Taken together, these results suggest that Cir1 may influence
the cell wall through more than one mechanism, including
the regulation of genes for biosynthetic enzymes and signal￾ing components.
The microarray analysis implicated Cir1 in the regulation
of genes for ergosterol synthesis, a result consistent with the
increased sensitivity of the cir1 mutant to the antifungal drug
amphotericin B and the decreased sensitivity to miconazole
that we observed (Figure 3B). Cir1 may play a role in
remodeling sterol composition, perhaps through an influence
on the iron-containing enzymes known to be required for
sterol and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore,
the transcript for AFR1, which encodes an ABC transporter
protein responsible for azole resistance [48], was 3.2- and
4.64-fold up-regulated in the cir1 mutants in low- and high￾iron conditions, respectively (unpublished data). This result
suggests that Cir1 may also influence anti-fungal resistance
through regulation of membrane transporters. We should
note, however, that the cir1 mutant in strain H99 (serotype A)
did not display altered sensitivity to SDS or the antifungal
drugs tested, suggesting that there are strain or serotype
differences in the influence of Cir1 (unpublished data). A
number of phenotypic differences have been reported for
serotype A and D strains, including differences in the
phenotypes controlled by signaling pathways [44,49]. Two
additional membrane-related genes that showed regulation
by Cir1 encoded a putative phospholipase C and a lysophos￾pholipase (PLB1). The negative regulation of PLB1 by Cir1 is
interesting because this gene is required for full virulence in
strain H99 [50]. The PLB1 transcript was elevated 4.43-fold
and 3.74-fold in the cir1 mutant in low-iron and high-iron
conditions, respectively (Table 3). It was previously reported
that Plb1 activity is negatively regulated by another zinc
finger protein Ste12a in a serotype D strain, and we
hypothesize that there might be coordinate regulation with
Cir1 [51,52].
Cir1 Links Temperature- and Calcium-Sensitive Growth
with Iron Homeostasis
We next examined the ability of the cir1 mutants to grow at
host temperature, because this is a critical virulence trait. The
growth of the cir1 mutants resembled the wild-type and
reconstituted strains at 30 8C, but the mutants displayed a
marked growth defect at 37 8C (Figure 3C). Cir1 may directly
or indirectly regulate genes related to temperature stress,
potentially in conjunction with calcium/calcineurin signaling
in Cr. neoformans [17–19]. This idea is supported by our array
data, which identified differentially expressed genes for the
calcineurin catalytic subunit (CNA1) and for the following
putative proteins: cyclophilin, FK506-binding protein, calm￾odulin dependent protein kinase (CDPK), and a calcium ion
transporter (Table 3). Transcript levels of MYO2 and CDC1
were also affected by deletion of CIR1. These genes are
interesting because of their relationship with calcium
homeostasis in Sa. cerevisiae and because MYO2 is a putative
downstream target of the calmodulin pathway in Cr. neofor￾mans [20,53]. We confirmed that calcium homeostasis was
altered in the cir1 mutants, by demonstrating increased
sensitivity to exogenous CaCl2 and FK506 (Figure 3D). These
results revealed important links between calcium and iron
regulation.
Cir1 Negatively Regulates Laccase Expression
As noted earlier, the LAC1 and LAC2 genes were part of a
cluster of genes encoding high-affinity and reductive iron￾uptake functions, thus suggesting a possible role for laccase in
related activities (Figure 2A). The marked up-regulation of
LAC1 in the cir1 mutant in both low- and high-iron media
prompted an analysis of laccase activity under the same
conditions. As shown in Figure 4A, laccase activity was indeed
increased in the cir1 mutants compared to wild-type cells, in
agreement with the microarray experiments. We also noticed
that the activity of laccase in the serotype A strain (H99) was
generally higher than in the serotype D strain (B3501A),
further reinforcing the differences between the strains and
suggesting a possible contribution of laccase activity to the
relatively higher virulence of the H99 strain. We investigated
whether the elevated laccase activity in the cir1 mutants was
affected by the glucose concentration in the medium, because
glucose is known to repress expression [14]. Laccase activity
appeared to be constitutive in the cir1 mutants with regard to
glucose concentration (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%; Figure 4B). As
expected, the wild-type and reconstituted strains displayed
derepression of laccase activity only in media containing
0.1% glucose. Similarly, constitutive de-repression of laccase

Iron and Fungal Pathogenesis

in the cir1 mutants was observed on DOPA medium with
different glucose concentrations (Figure 4C). Finally, we
noted a higher transcript level for the gene encoding the
copper transporter Ccc2 in the cir1 mutant, indicating
negative regulation by Cir1 (Table 3). Ccc2 is required for
melanization in Cr. neoformans, possibly through an influence
on intracellular copper concentration [54]; this role for Ccc2
may also contribute to the increased laccase activity of the
cir1 mutant. We conclude that Cir1 is a negative regulator of
laccase expression and that Cir1 is required for the influence
of glucose on laccase expression.
Loss of Cir1 Abolishes Virulence
The accumulation of virulence-related phenotypes for cir1
mutants strongly suggested a defect in virulence, and we
tested this prediction in the mouse inhalation model of
cryptococcosis. We tested the cir1 mutant in the serotype A
strain H99 because this background displays the highest
virulence, and we found that the mutant was avirulent. In
contrast, mice infected with the parental or reconstituted
strains succumbed to infection by approximately 20 d (Figure
5). These results strongly support our hypothesis that Cir1 is a
key regulator of virulence gene expression, and demonstrate
the importance of iron regulation for cryptococcosis.
Discussion
The mechanisms by which fungal pathogens sense the
mammalian host environment and regulate virulence factor
expression are poorly understood. To address this issue, we
identified Cir1 as a candidate iron-responsive transcription
factor in Cr. neoformans, and characterized phenotypic and
transcriptional changes resulting from deletion of the gene.
Remarkably, we found that Cir1 regulates the majority of
iron-responsive genes and influences all of the major known
virulence factors (summarized in Figure 6). Specifically, the
transcript levels for 733 genes changed in wild-type cells in
response to iron concentration. Of these, 250 were up￾regulated in low-iron versus high-iron medium, and deletion
of CIR1 largely eliminated the response of this group of
genes. Key iron-related genes that were negatively regulated
by Cir1 included components of the reductive uptake system
(i.e., FRE1, FTR1, and FET3). Orthologs of some of these genes
are also negatively regulated by Sfu1 in Ca. albicans and by
Fep1 in Sc. pombe [26,27,55]. Candidate siderophore trans￾porter genes are also negatively regulated by Fep1 and Sfu1
[27,55] but, in contrast, these functions appeared to be
positively regulated by Cir1 suggesting that the protein may
function both as a repressor and an activator to regulate
different iron transport systems. Lan et al. also found that
Sfu1 has both positive and negative regulatory functions, and
interestingly, some of the positively regulated functions
included cell-surface components [55]. Structural differences
between Cir1 (e.g., single zinc finger motif) and the other
fungal iron regulators (two zinc finger motifs) may account
for variation in regulatory capabilities.
The positive influence of Cir1 may result from downstream
regulators that transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally
control the genes for siderophore transporters and other
functions. In Sa. cerevisiae, the iron regulators Aft1 and Aft2
control expression of Cth2, which in turn enhances mRNA
decay for transcripts of genes of the TCA cycle as well as
sterol and heme biosynthesis [56]. This study and work in
bacteria and mammalian cells reveal that post-transcriptional
regulation is an important component of the cellular
response to iron deprivation [57,58]. Although additional
levels of iron regulation have not yet been identified in Cr.
neoformans, we hypothesize that the positive and negative roles
of Cir1 might allow modulation of iron acquisition systems in
response to different iron sources available in the host or the
environment. It is interesting to note that Cir1 shares
regulatory features with the iron-responsive transcription
factors such as Fur (Ferric uptake regulator) in bacterial
pathogens [32,33]. One feature in common is that Fur can
exert both positive and negative regulation, as demonstrated
in Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Neisseria meningitides, and
Vibrio cholerae [59–63]. Moreover, bacterial Fur proteins not
only influence iron uptake/homeostasis, but also several other
cellular processes including pyrimidine metabolism, methio￾nine biosynthesis [64], nonfermentable carbon source uti￾lization [65], acidic tolerance [66], oxidative stress [60],
chemotaxis [67], and virulence factor (e.g., shiga toxin and
diphtheria toxin) expression [68]. The diversity of these
processes is reminiscent of the features of Cir1 regulation
revealed by our expression studies (Figure 6).
Our analysis of Cir1 revealed a link between iron
regulation and melanin production, an important virulence
trait in Cr. neoformans [13,69–71]. The neurotropism of Cr.
neoformans may result in part from the ability of the fungus to
produce protective melanin from catecholamines in the brain
[14]. A recent study demonstrated that laccase is expressed
early in murine infection (until 24 h) and decreases thereafter
as the fungal burden rises [72]. The same study showed that
laccase is released from the cell wall in vivo, and suggested a
role for laccase as an antioxidant or an iron scavenger. Lui et
al. also proposed iron-related functions for laccase, based on
the similarities of the copper-containing regions of laccase
and Fet3 [73]. The enzyme does possess strong ferrous iron
oxidase activity in the absence of substrates, and this activity
may protect cells from hydroxyl radicals generated from host
macrophages and neutrophils, and potentially contribute to
iron transport [73]. Our observations support a role for
laccase in iron metabolism, because LAC1 and LAC2 were

is shown.

Iron and Fungal Pathogenesis

identified as targets of Cir1 with expression patterns similar
to genes of the reductive iron transport pathway (e.g., FTR1
and FET3). We speculate that laccase oxidation of ferrous
iron may be important during infection in addition to the
enzyme’s role in melanin production. The fact that laccase is
expressed only during very early stages of infection would be
consistent with a role in iron acquisition and in protection of
fungal cells from hydroxyl radical attack from host cells
during the initial adaptation to the host environment.
Additionally, we found putative Cir1 binding sites (GATA
motif) in the promoter region of LAC1 (unpublished data),
and interestingly, regions containing these motifs were
previously proposed to bind to negative regulatory proteins
[74]. Up-regulation of the copper transporter Ccc2 in the cir1
mutant may increase intracellular copper concentration and
partly contribute to higher laccase activity, because copper is
known to induce transcription of LAC1 [54,75].
The cell wall plays a key role in the virulence of Cr.
neoformans as the site of melanin deposition and capsule
attachment [11,12,76]. We found that Cir1 and iron may
influence cell wall remodeling and capsule formation by at
least two mechanisms. First, the transcription of genes related
to cell wall functions, including chitin synthases and a-1,3-
glucan synthase, was altered in the cir1 mutants, and the
mutants have defects in cell wall integrity. Additionally, Cir1
influences expression of the MAP kinase of the cell wall
integrity pathway (MPK1). Capsule polysaccharide attach￾ment to the cell surface requires a-1,3-glucan [76] and
deletion of CIR1 may alter glucan composition to influence
attachment. A second mechanism may involve Cir1 regu￾lation of the cAMP pathway that controls capsule and
melanin formation [43]. We found that the transcript for
Gpr4 is positively controlled by Cir1, and Xue et al. have
shown that the capsule size of the gpr4 mutants is reduced by
30% compared to the wild type [45]. In this study,
exogenously added cAMP partially restored capsule on cells
of the cir1 mutants in the serotype A, but not the serotype D
background. Together, these results suggest that Cir1
interacts with the cAMP pathway, but that the protein
regulates other capsule-related functions. That is, the
mechanisms for biosynthesis and assembly of the capsule
are undoubtedly complex, and the capsule defect in cir1
mutants likely is due to additional mechanisms. For example,
changes in the redox status on the cell surface of the mutants
could contribute to poor capsule assembly or attachment.
Surface changes would be consistent with the higher levels of
cell surface ferric reductase and laccase activity displayed by
the mutants.
We found that loss of CIR1 influences the transcript levels
for components involved in calcium signaling (e.g., calcineur￾in), and an extensive body of elegant work connects these
functions to virulence and the stress response in Cr. neofor￾mans [77,78]. Additionally, Kraus et al. showed that inactiva￾tion of calcineurin causes an Mpk1-dependent increase in
transcript level for the FKS1 gene encoding a component of
b-1,3-glucan synthase [46]. Our phenotypic analysis revealed
that cir1 mutants showed increased sensitivity to CaCl2 and
FK506, as well as a growth defect at 37 8C, implying that Cir1
and calcium signaling components influence common targets.
Connections between iron and calcium homeostasis could
occur at a number of levels. For example, the up-regulation of
a calcium transporter or a putative Ca2þ/calmodulin-depend￾ent protein kinase (type II) in the cir1 mutant (Table 3) could
influence sensitivity to calcium. The kinase is one of the
downstream regulatory proteins activated by Ca2þ/calmodulin
along with calcineurin. It is also possible that elevated
intracellular iron in the cir1 mutants might directly influence
the activity of calcineurin because this protein contains a Fe￾Zn dinuclear metal center at its active site that is required for
full activity [79].
Defects in host iron homeostasis exacerbate many bacte￾rial, fungal, and parasitic infections [1,2,80]. For fungi, iron

overload increases the mortality of mice infected with Ca.
albicans, and elevated iron was found in patients with
vulvovaginal candidosis [81,82]. Similarly, iron overload and
chelation therapy with deferoxamine both enhance zygomy￾coses, thus illustrating the importance of a balance in iron
availability [83]. Iron overload and other host factors such as
smoking also exacerbate cryptococcal meningoencephalitis,
perhaps by stimulating fungal growth and perturbing macro￾phage-mediated anticryptococcal defenses [84–86]. Our
analysis of Cir1 reveals the underlying importance of iron
sensing in the expression of virulence factors leading to
cryptococcosis. These finding could have therapeutic value
because the prevalence of cryptococcosis in sub-Saharan
Africa may be associated with nutritional and genetic aspects
of iron overloading in the background of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic [87,88]. An understanding of the regulation of Cr.
neoformans virulence could have considerable impact because
cryptococcosis is responsible for 13%–44% of all deaths of
HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa [89].
Materials and Methods
Strains and growth conditions. Strains (Table S1) were grown in
yeast extract, bacto-peptone, and 2.0% glucose (YPD; Becton,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, United States)
medium or yeast nitrogen base (YNB, Becton, Dickinson and
Company) with 2.0% glucose. Low-iron medium (LIM) was prepared
as described [9]. Iron-replete medium (LIMþFe) contained 100 lM of
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ferric-sodium salt (FeEDTA; Sigma,
St. Louis, Missouri, United States).
Isolation of CIR1 and mutant construction. The CIR1 genes in
strains B3501A and H99 were identified by searching for homologs of
Sc. pombe Fep1 in the serotype D genome database (TIGR Cryptococcus
neoformans Genome Project [http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/cna1/]) or the
serotype A genome database (Broad Institute Cryptococcus neoformans
Database [http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/cryptococ￾cus_neoformans/index.html]), respectively. The cDNAs of CIR1 from
B3501A and H99 were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into pCR2.1
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States), and sequenced.
To construct cir1 mutants, the entire locus of CIR1 in both B3501A
(3,606 base pairs [bp]) and H99 (3,576 bp) was replaced by a
disruption cassette containing the nourseothricin acetyltransferase
gene (NAT) and 59 and 39 flanking sequences of CIR1 were included
for homologous recombination. The primers J2FEP-5F and J2FEP-5R,
and J2FEP-3F and J2FEP3R were used to amplify the 59 upstream
(911 to 11) and the 39 downstream regions (þ3,608 to þ4,655) of
B3501A CIR1, respectively (Table S1). The primers H9FEP-5F and
H9FEP-5R (1,024 to 33), and H9FEP-3F and H9FEP-3R (þ3,805 to
þ4,806) were used to amplify the 59 upstream and the 39 downstream
region of H99 CIR1, respectively (Table S1). Amplified 59 and 39
flanking regions from B3501A CIR1 and H99 CIR1 were digested with
XhoI and ApaI, and, SpeI and SacI, respectively, and ligated to
pCH233 containing the NAT gene to generate plasmids pWH008 and
pWH016. Disruption cassettes from the plasmids were amplified by
PCR using primers J2FEP-5F and J2-FEP3R, and H9FEP-5F and
H9FEP-3R, and biolistically transformed into wild-type strains as
described previously [90]. Positive transformants were identified by
PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Figure S1). At least two
independent mutants in each strain were used throughout the study.
To construct reconstituted strains, primers J2CIR-F-Xb and J2CIR￾R-Nt, and H9CIR-F-Xb and H9CIR-R-Nt were used to amplify the
wild-type CIR1 genes from B3501A and H99, respectively (Table S1).
These fragments were digested with XbaI and NotI and cloned to
pCH233 to construct pWH020 and pWH021. The SacI- and SpeI￾digested fragments from pWH008 and pWH016 were then cloned
into pJAF to construct pWH023 and pWH024 containing the
neomycin-resistant marker (NEO) and the 39 downstream regions of
CIR1 of B3501A and H99, respectively. The NEO-CIR1 39 region
fusion fragments were released by digestion with NotI and KpnI, and
were cloned into pWH020 and pWH021 digested with the same
enzymes, respectively. The resulting plasmids pWH031 and pWH034
were digested with XbaI and transformed into the cir1 mutants of
B3501A and H99, respectively. Positive transformants containing the
wild-type CIR1 gene at its authentic locus were identified by PCR.
Phenotypic analysis. The overlay assay with TTC (Sigma) to
evaluate cell surface reductase activity was performed as described
previously [91,92]. To assess strain sensitivity to iron-restricted or to
iron-overload conditions, 1.0 3 104 cells were spotted onto YPD
medium (containing 0.75 mM ferrozine) with or without 200 lM
FeEDTA and were grown at 30 8C for 2 d. Phleomycin sensitivity was
performed by spotting 1.0 3 104 cells onto YPD medium containing
0.25-lg/ml phleomycin. For other plate assays, 10-fold serial dilutions
of cells were spotted onto YPD plates containing chemicals as
indicated, with incubation at 30 8C for 2 to 3 d. To assess capsule
formation, cells were grown in YNB medium at 30 8C overnight,
washed twice with low-iron water, and diluted to 5.0 3 106 cells/ml in
LIM or RPMI medium (Invitrogen). Cells were then grown for 24 h at
30 8C or 37 8C under 5% CO2.
Laccase assay. Cells were grown in YNB overnight at 30 8C, pelleted
and then washed three times with LIM, diluted to 1.0 3 107 cells/ml in
50 ml of LIM with 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0% glucose, and incubated for 12
h at 30 8C. After incubation, 1.0 3 107 cells were withdrawn from each
culture and then washed three times with LIM. Cells were then
incubated in 10 mM L-DOPA (Sigma) for 30 min (B3501A) or 10 min
(H99) at 30 8C. A shorter incubation time was applied for H99
because the significantly stronger melanin formation of the serotype
A cir1 mutants causes precipitation of melanin in the reaction tubes
and interferes proper OD readings. Cells were pelleted at the end of
the incubation and the absorbance (A475) of the supernatant was
measured. The enzyme activity was calculated as A475 of 0.001¼1 unit
of laccase. DOPA medium was used for plate melanin assays as
described [93,94].
RNA hybridization and microarray experiments. The cir1 mutant
B3CIR1#572 and the parent strain B3501A were used for microarray
analysis. Three biological replicates for each strain were grown in 50
ml of YNB overnight at 30 8C, followed by growth in LIM at the same
temperature for an additional 12 h. The latter step was added in
order to eliminate any iron carryover from the rich medium. Cultures
were harvested and then washed twice with LIM. Cell numbers were
determined, and cells were transferred to 50-ml LIM or LIM þ Fe
(final density of 1.0 3 107 cells/ml). Cells were grown at 30 8C for
another 12 h, harvested, and lyophilized for RNA extractions. Cell
densities at the time of harvest were 5.0 3 107 cells/ml (wild type in
LIM), 1.0 3108 cells/ml (wild type in LIMþFe), 1.03107 cells/ml (cir1D
in LIM), and 1.5 3 107 cells/ml (cir1D in LIM þ Fe). Trizol (Invitrogen)
was used for total RNA extractions following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. RNA was analyzed with the Agilent 2100 Bio￾analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, United
States) and cDNA was synthesized from 5 lg of total RNA by
SuperScriptII Reverse Transcript Enzyme (Invitrogen). The 3DNA
Array 350 kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, Pennsylvania, United States) was
used to label cDNA with Cy3 or Cy5 for hybridization to 70-mer
microarrays (http://genome.wustl.edu/activity/ma/cneoformans/).
RNA blot analysis was performed as described by Sambrook et al.
with 5 lg of total RNA from each strain [95]. Hybridization probes
were designed for the genes from each serotype, and DNA fragments
were amplified separately by PCR with the primers listed in Table S2.
A Strip-EZ DNA kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States) was used
for probe labeling, and the membrane was exposed to a Phosphor
Screen (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States)
for 12 h and scanned using a Storm 860 Gel and Blot imaging system
(Amersham).
Microarray hybridization, statistical analysis, and data mining. The
following loop design, which consists of four nodes and paths
including dye-swap, was adopted for this study: wild type (LIM) $
wild type (LIM þ Fe), wild type (LIM) $ cir1D (LIM), wild type (LIM þ
Fe) $ cir1D (LIM þ Fe), and cir1D (LIM) $ cir1D (LIM þ Fe). A total of
24 arrays were used for the experiment. After hybridization, arrays
were scanned immediately using the PerkinElmer ScanArray Express
(PerkinElmer, Wellesley, California, United States). Each channel was
background corrected by subtracting the lowest 10% of foreground
signal intensity. The two channels of each array were normalized to
each other by Huber’s variance stabilization algorithm, vsn [96]. A
linear mixed effects model was applied to the normalized data in each
channel. A fixed effect was included for each array, for the dye by
gene interaction, and for each combination of iron availability and/or
deletion of CIR1. Random effects were included for within-array
variability (each gene appeared twice on each array), technical
variability (each replicate culture was hybridized four times), and
biological variability (12 replicate cultures were employed). The
changes in wild type (LIM) versus wild type (LIMþFe), wild type (LIM)
versus cir1D (LIM), wild type (LIM þ Fe) versus cir1D (LIM þ Fe), and
cir1D (LIM) versus cir1D (LIM þ Fe) were estimated with standard

errors and p-values based on Student t statistics; q-values were
computed to adjust for the false discovery rate.
The microarray data mining tool ermineJ was used to analyze the
microarray dataset based on GO terms [39]. The q-values from the
microarray data were used as input scores and gene score resampling
analysis (GSA) was applied. For clustering, genes with GO terms
(cellular process) related to iron transport and homeostasis, and that
were more than 2-fold differentially expressed in at least one
experiment (with a statistically significant q-value less than 0.05),
were extracted from the microarray data. The signal ratio of these
genes was then log-transformed, clustered by Cluster 3.0 (average
linkage) [97], and visualized by Java Tree View 1.0.12 [98].
Virulence assay. Thirty female A/Jcr mice (4 to 6 wk old) were
obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, United
States). The Cr. neoformans cells for inoculation were grown in YPD
medium overnight at 30 8C, washed twice with PBS, counted with a
haemocytometer, and resuspended at 1.0 3 106 cells/ml in PBS. Mice
were weighed and then anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine in
saline. Mice were secured on a thread by their superior incisors, 50 ll
of the cell suspension (5.0 3 104 cells) was intranasally instilled, and
the mice were left on the thread for 10 min. The status of the mice
was monitored twice per day post-inoculation. The protocol for the
virulence assays (protocol A99–0252) conformed to regulatory
standards and was approved by the University of British Columbia
(UBC) Committee on Animal Care.
