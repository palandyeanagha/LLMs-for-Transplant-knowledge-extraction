Abstract
Successful long term parenteral nutrition has transformed the
prognosis for children with irreversible intestinal failure in the last
three decades, but has also highlighted the long term complications:
intestinal failure associated liver disease; recurrent catheter sepsis;
and impaired venous access. Recent advances in small bowel
transplantation and non-transplant surgical techniques now offer
hope of sustained survival in the future without parenteral
nutrition.
