BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is common in patients with heart 
failure (HF) and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor 
outcomes. Whether correction of iron deficiency with (intravenous) ferric 
carboxymaltose (FCM) affects peak oxygen consumption [peak VO2
], an 
objective measure of exercise intolerance in HF, has not been examined.
METHODS: We studied patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection 
fraction ≤45%) and mild to moderate symptoms despite optimal HF 
medication. Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with FCM for 24 
weeks or standard of care. The primary end point was the change in peak 
VO2
 from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary end points included the effect 
on hematinic and cardiac biomarkers, quality of life, and safety. For the 
primary analysis, patients who died had a value of 0 imputed for 24-week 
peak VO2
. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the 
impact of imputation of missing peak VO2
 data.
RESULTS: A total of 172 patients with HF were studied and received FCM 
(n=86) or standard of care (control group, n=86). At baseline, the groups 
were well matched; mean age was 64 years, 75% were male, mean left 
ventricular ejection fraction was 32%, and peak VO2
 was 13.5 mL/min/kg. 
FCM significantly increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. At 24 
weeks, peak VO2
 had decreased in the control group (least square means 
‒1.19±0.389 mL/min/kg) but was maintained on FCM (‒0.16±0.387 
mL/min/kg; P=0.020 between groups). In a sensitivity analysis, in which 
missing data were not imputed, peak VO2
 at 24 weeks decreased by 
‒0.63±0.375 mL/min/kg in the control group and by ‒0.16±0.373 mL/
min/kg in the FCM group; P=0.23 between groups). Patients’ global 
assessment and functional class as assessed by the New York Heart 
Association improved on FCM versus standard of care.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with intravenous FCM in patients with HF 
and iron deficiency improves iron stores. Although a favorable effect on 
peak VO2
 was observed on FCM, compared with standard of care in the 
primary analysis, this effect was highly sensitive to the imputation strategy 
for peak VO2
 among patients who died. Whether FCM is associated with 
an improved outcome in these high-risk patients needs further study.

Ferric Carboxymaltose and Exercise in Heart Failure

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
ARTICLE
I
ron deficiency is increasingly recognized as an im￾portant comorbidity in patients with heart failure 
(HF) and is present in up to 35% to 50% of patients 
with HF.1–5 Its prevalence is related to the severity of 
the disease and is a strong and independent predictor 
of outcome, in both the presence and absence of ane￾mia. Iron deficiency decreases exercise capacity, in both 
healthy volunteers and patients with chronic HF.4,6–8 Iron 
plays an important role in oxygen transport, not only 
through hematopoiesis but also in the metabolism of 
cardiac and skeletal muscles. All these factors play a 
role in the reduced exercise capacity in HF.
Given the importance of iron deficiency, a clear ra￾tionale exists for investigating the effect of correcting 
this, and a few small studies suggested cause for opti￾mism.2,7 More recently, 2 larger randomized controlled 
trials have been conducted with (intravenous) iron (ie, 
ferric carboxymaltose [FCM]) in patients with HF with 
iron deficiency.9,10 These studies showed that FCM im￾proved symptoms, quality of life, and functional capac￾ity, irrespective of the presence of anemia. The drug 
was well tolerated and safe. At 1-year follow-up, FCM 
was also associated with a reduction in the risk of first 
hospitalization for worsening HF.10
Exercise intolerance is one of the hallmarks of chron￾ic HF, and it is further reduced in the presence of iron 
deficiency.2,4,6–8 Although intravenous iron (FCM) was 
shown to increase 6-minute walking test distance in 
patients with HF,9,10 this parameter may be subject to 
some bias. Therefore, investigation of more robust and 
objective parameters during cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing (CPET), such as peak oxygen consumption (peak 
VO2
),11 would seem useful.
The aim of the present EFFECT-HF study (Effect of 
Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients 
With Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure) was to 
examine the effect of treatment with intravenous FCM, 
compared with standard of care, on exercise capacity 
in patients with symptomatic chronic HF and iron de￾ficiency.
METHODS
Patient Population
Patients were eligible for the EFFECT-HF study if they were ≥18 
years of age, had clinically stable mild to moderate chronic HF 
(New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II‒III), 
and were on optimal background therapy for HF for ≥4 
weeks and with no dose changes in the last 2 weeks. Their 
left ventricular ejection fraction had to be ≤45% and had to 
be performed in ≤3 months of screening and >3 months after 
stable β-blocker therapy or device implantation, in particu￾lar cardiac resynchronization therapy. Plasma brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP) concentration at baseline had to be >100 pg/
mL or N-terminal (NT) proBNP had to be >400 pg/mL. Patients 
were required to have a decreased exercise capacity, as shown 
by a reproducible peak VO2
 of 10 to 20 mL/kg/min. Patients 
also needed to have documented iron deficiency, as defined 
by a serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or a serum ferritin of 100 to 
300 ng/mL in combination with a transferrin saturation (TSAT) 
<20%.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had a known 
sensitivity to FCM, a history of iron overload, or received 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, intravenous iron therapy 
and/or blood transfusions in the 6 weeks before randomiza￾tion. There was no lower limit of hemoglobin (Hb), but sub￾jects with an immediate need of blood transfusion or an Hb 
>15 g/dL were also excluded. Patients who had undergone an 
exercise training program in the previous 3 months, or those 
planned in the next 6 months, as well as those with an active 
bacterial infection, those with serious liver disease (trans￾aminases >3 times the upper limit), a known vitamin B12 
or serum folate deficiency, or a known human immunodefi￾ciency virus or hepatitis B or C infection were also excluded. 
Patients with clinical evidence of current malignancy and on 
renal dialysis were also not included. Patients with unstable 
angina pectoris, severe valvular disease, or left ventricular out￾flow tract obstruction; patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter 
with a ventricular response rate of >100 beats per minute 
at rest; and patients with recent (<3 months) acute coronary 
syndrome, coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous cor￾onary interventions, transient ischemic attack, or stroke were 
also excluded. Finally, women who were pregnant or without 
adequate contraception and subjects with (recent) participa￾tion in another study or with low body weight (<35 kg) were 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Iron deficiency is increasingly recognized as a seri￾ous comorbidity in patients with heart failure and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
• In earlier studies, patient treatment with ferric car￾boxymaltose maltose (FCM, intravenous iron) was 
shown to decrease symptoms and improve func￾tional capacity.
• In the present study, iron supplementation with 
FCM led to repletion of iron stores and improve￾ment in measures of disease severity and quality 
of life.
• A decline in peak VO2
 in the control group was 
driven by deaths, with imputed values of 0 in the 
control group. This decline was not seen in the 
FCM group.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Iron supplementation with (intravenous) FCM sig￾nificantly increased serum ferritin and transferrin 
saturation.
• The effects of iron supplementation with (intrave￾nous) FCM include improvements in quality of life.
• Further study is needed to determine the impact 
of intravenous FCM supplementation on functional 
capacity and clinical outcome.

excluded. The study followed the principles outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from 
the Medical Ethics Committee of each participating center, 
and all subjects gave their written informed consent before 
enrollment.
Study Design
The EFFECT-HF study was a prospective randomized con￾trolled, multicenter, open-label trial with blinded end-point 
evaluation. It aimed to examine the effect of treatment with 
intravenous FCM, compared with standard of care, on exer￾cise capacity in patients with symptomatic chronic HF and 
iron deficiency. After an initial screening period (≤12 weeks), 
eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to FCM or usual care 
for a period of 24 weeks. Study visits took place on day 0 
(baseline) and at weeks 6, 12, and 24. Within the screening 
period, the reproducibility of peak VO2
 had to be confirmed 
with applicable tests. Subjects randomized to standard of care 
could receive oral iron at the discretion of their attending phy￾sician but were not permitted intravenous iron.
The primary end point was the change in peak VO2
 from 
baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary end points included the 
effect of FCM on hematinic indices (Hb, ferritin, and TSAT), 
natriuretic peptides (BNP and NTproBNP), NYHA functional 
class, and patient global assessment. In addition, safety 
parameters were collected.
The study was designed and conducted by the steer￾ing committee, and an independent data safety monitoring 
board reviewed data on an ongoing basis. The independent 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee adjudicated all hospitaliza￾tions and deaths. All analyses were performed according to 
a predefined statistical analysis plan validated by the spon￾sor, Vifor Pharma Ltd. The manuscript was prepared by the 
principal investigator (D.J.v.V.) and subsequently reviewed by 
all authors and Vifor Pharma for scientific accuracy, but the 
authors had final authority. The authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the reported analyses. The EFFECT-HF 
study is registered at Clinical.Trials.gov, NCT01394562.
Study Drug Administration
Intravenous iron was given as FCM solution (Ferinject/
Injectafer, Vifor Pharma) as an undiluted intravenous bolus 
injection (administered in ≥1 minute) or an infusion. Infusions 
of 10 or 20 mL (which is the amount of FCM that is equivalent 
to 500 or 1000 mg of iron, respectively) were administered 
diluted in ≈100 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution 
and given in ≥6 minutes for 10 mL (infusion of 20 mL diluted 
in ≈200 mL and administered in ≥15 minutes). Dosing at day 
0 and week 6 was based on screening Hb and weight and 
not on ferritin and TSAT results. On day 0 (baseline), patients 
with Hb ≤14 g/dL, both < and >70 kg received 1000 mg FCM 
(20 mL), whereas patients >14g/dL received 500 mg FCM (10 
mL). At week 6, patients <70 kg with Hb <10 g/dL received a 
second dose of 500 mg FCM, whereas patients with Hb ≥10 
g/dL received no second dose. At week 6, for patients ≥70 
kg, those with Hb <10 g/dL received another dose of 1000 
mg FCM, whereas those with Hb 10 to 14 g/dL received 500 
mg FCM, and those with Hb >14 g/dL received no additional 
dose. At week 12, FCM was only administered (at a dose of 
500 mg FCM) if serum ferritin was <100 ng/mL or if ferritin 
was 100 to 300 ng/mL with TSAT <20% (ie, if patients were 
still iron deficient). No specific treatment advice was given 
for patients in the standard of care group, and oral iron was 
allowed.
Exercise Testing
General Organization for Participating Centers
Before the trial, ≥1 investigator from each participating site 
attended a 1-day session (at the Exercise Laboratory of A.C.-S. 
in Paris) to homogenize the CPET methods. A video and book 
summarizing all technical recommendations were provided to 
all investigators. Before including the first patient in the study, 
all centers validated the measurement system. All data were 
reviewed blindly (ie, unaware of treatment assignment) by the 
core laboratory in Paris.
CPET Methodology
CPET was done at screening (<3 months before baseline), 
baseline, and weeks 12 and 24. To be eligible for the study, 
patients were required to have a decreased exercise capacity 
as shown by a peak VO2
 of 10 to 20 mL/kg/min. All patients 
underwent gas exchange with breath-by-breath measure￾ments during exercise according to current standards.12
Exercise capacity was estimated by 2 tests (completed within 
4 weeks of each other and ≥3 days apart) with ≥1 test com￾pleted within 4 weeks before baseline visit. An earlier test 
could be used as test 1 if performed within 4 weeks before 
screening. The 2 tests were required to have <10% difference 
in values (and the last CPET was used as the baseline value). 
If >10% difference, a third test could be performed within 
4 weeks and ≥3 days after the second test. For the baseline 
tests, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) had to be ≥1.0. 
Exercise tests were all conducted on a bicycle. A graded pro￾tocol was used; after a rest stage of ≥2 minutes, the work rate 
was increased by 10 W every minute (or with a ramp protocol 
with a similar increment on load) after a first 20 W stage. 
Patients were exercised until exhaustion or when an incident 
led to termination of the test (including serious arrhythmia, 
sudden drop in BP, angina, and ischemia). Only tests stopped 
because of fatigue or dyspnea were retained in the analysis. 
At peak exercise, patients were asked to continue pedaling 
at a slow pace with a work rate of 20 W during ≥3 min￾utes. Heart rate was continuously monitored and blood pres￾sure measured every 2 minutes. A standard 12-lead ECG was 
recorded continuously during exercise.12
Gas analyzers were calibrated before each test. Patients 
were asked to start exercise only when baseline RER was <1, 
baseline oxygen consumption (VO2
) was between 3 and 6 mL/
min/kg, and ventilation (VE) was between 8 and 12 L/min. 
Gas sampling was done through a face mask. All tests had to 
be symptom-limited, with strong encouragement to achieve 
an RER >1.10 and a Borg rating of perceived exertion >16/20. 
Only tests with a peak RER >1.0 were accepted at baseline. 
Only patients with a peak VO2
 between 10 and 20 mL/min/kg 
could be included. The VO2
, carbon dioxide production, and 
VE were measured breath by breath.
The primary end point was change in peak VO2
 in ml/min/
kg. Peak VO2
 was the average of the values over the last 20 
seconds of exercise. We also measured the slope between

minute VE and carbon dioxide production (also named venti￾latory efficiency, secondary end point) because this parameter 
can be assessed even when exercise is submaximal and has 
important prognostic value similar to that of peak VO2
.
13,14
Other Secondary End Points
Functional class was assessed by the attending physician 
throughout the study according to the NYHA functional class. 
Patient global assessment (self-reported) was assessed using 
a simple score, which consists of a simple judgment indicating 
improvement, no change, or worsening since the start of the 
study, using the Likert scale, as previously described15 and also 
used in previous studies with FCM.9,10 In short, the effect of 
FCM on symptoms is reported as an odds ratio for being in 
a better rank versus the control group, whereby a value >1.0 
indicates an improvement. Analyses of the effect of FCM on 
NYHA class and patient global assessment were conducted 
with and without imputation of missing values (observed val￾ues). BNP and NTproBNP were measured in a core laboratory 
using standard methodology. Effect of FCM on hematinics 
was also examined, and safety data were collected.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size calculation was based on an earlier small 
focused study16 with (another) intravenous iron, in which the 
difference in peak VO2
 between active treatment and controls 
was 2.2±2.1 mL/min/kg. Hence, the steering committee elected 
a more conservative estimate of a difference of 1.5 and a stan￾dard deviation of 2.8 mL/min/kg for the power calculation. 
Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 75 patients per 
group (150 total) was needed for 90% power using an alpha of 
0.05 (2-sided). The sample size was rounded up to 80 patients 
per group (160 total) to allow for some loss of information. 
Three analysis sets of subjects were considered for the sta￾tistical analysis of the study.
A full analysis set (FAS) defined according to the inten￾tion to treat principle included all subjects who had ≥1 study 
drug administration in FCM group, were randomized in usual 
care (control) group, and had ≥1 efficacy assessment after 
baseline. The primary analysis of the primary end point, the 
change from baseline of the weight-adjusted peak VO2
 at 
week 24, was performed on the FAS. A peak VO2
 of 0 was 
imputed to subjects who died before week 24, and a last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used for 
subjects without assessment at week 24. An analysis of cova￾riance model, including as covariates baseline-adjusted peak 
VO2
, country, and screening hemoglobin (<12 g/dL or ≥12 g/
dL), was used to compare treatment groups.
A supportive per protocol (PP) set analysis was applied to 
assess the robustness or sensitivity of the primary analysis, in 
which all subjects from the FAS were included who did not 
have a major protocol deviation, as defined in a Blind Data 
Review Meeting before the database lock. Also in this set of 
subjects, LOCF imputation has been used for missing values 
and 0 values for subjects who died, not including the second￾ary sensitivity analysis. In addition, assessments of subjects 
who had a forbidden treatment (blood transfusion, erythro￾poiesis-stimulating agents) were censored from the day the 
forbidden treatment was started. Furthermore, subjects were 
censored for the PP analysis if they had a cardiopulmonary 
exercise test that was not considered valid (in a blind manner) 
by the core laboratory (RER <1, wrong exercise protocol).
A safety set included all subjects who had a study drug 
administration in the FCM group or were randomized in stan￾dard of care group (ie, also including patients who had no 
efficacy assessment after baseline). All-cause mortality and 
hospitalization for worsening HF and other cardiovascular 
reasons were analyzed for the safety set. Safety analyses were 
performed on all subjects who received ≥1 dose of study drug 
or were randomized to the usual care group.
A number of additional supportive analyses of the primary 
outcome were also performed on the FAS and the PP set of 
subjects by (1) imputing worst value across all patients and 
all time points for missing values because of hospitalization 
and 0 for patients who died (worst value imputation), (2) 
using only observed values without any imputation using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA model for the FAS and PP set, 
and (3) terms of interaction between pooled country and 
treatment group as well as interaction between Hb level at 
screening and treatment group was evaluated.
NYHA classification scores were analyzed over time using a 
repeated measures polytomous regression and at week 24 with 
LOCF imputation using a polytomous regression, with multino￾mial logistic regressions. This analysis was performed on the 
change of NYHA class compared with baseline and given rela￾tive to the standard of care arm as described before.9,10
RESULTS
Study Population
We enrolled 174 patients from 28 sites across 9 coun￾tries (Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The 
Netherlands, Poland, Russia, and Spain). Two patients 
in the FCM arm did not have an efficacy assessment 
after baseline, and these 2 were excluded from the FAS. 
Therefore, the study population consisted of 172 pa￾tients (Figure  1); their baseline characteristics are de￾picted in Table 1. At baseline, the 2 groups were gener￾ally well matched. Of the 172 patients, 161 patients 
could be examined for the primary end point: effect on 
peak VO2
 during CPET after 24 weeks (Figure 1). A total 
of 146 patients were analyzed in the PP population. Of 
the 86 patients in the usual care group, 29 received 
oral iron supplementation by their attending physician 
(because this was allowed according to the protocol).
Iron Administration and Dosing
At baseline, the 2 groups were similar in terms of Hb, 
serum ferritin, and TSAT (Table 1). All patients by defi￾nition had iron deficiency, but a decreased serum fer￾ritin (<100 ng/mL) was present in 84% of patients and 
a decreased TSAT (<20%) in 58%. Of the 86 patients 
in the FCM group, 37 (42%) received only 1 adminis￾tration, 48 patients (55%) needed 2, and 3 (3%), re￾quired 3 administrations. Mean administered dose of

iron (FCM) was 1204±391 mg (median dose 1000 mg). 
After 24 weeks (end of study), all hematinic indices 
had increased significantly in the FCM group: Hb was 
13.9±1.3 g/dL, ferritin was 283±150 ng/mL, and TSAT 
was 27±8% (all P<0.05 compared to baseline).
Patients in the standard of care group also showed 
small changes in hematinics after 24 weeks (Hb 
13.2±1.4 g/dL and ferritin 79 ng/mL; both P=NS [not 
significant] versus baseline), whereas TSAT slightly in￾creased to 20.2% (P=0.035 compared to baseline). All 
changes in the standard of care group were significant￾ly different (P<0.05) versus FCM.
Effect on Exercise Parameters
At baseline, the 2 groups were well matched for peak 
VO2
 and VE/carbon dioxide production slope (Table 1). 
After 24 weeks, peak VO2
 (LOCF, primary end point; 
n=161) had decreased by –1.19±0.389 mL/min/kg in

the standard of care group, whereas it was virtually un￾changed in the FCM group (‒0.16±0.387 mL/kg/min) 
(the difference of least square means±standard error: 
1.04±0.44 mL/kg/min; P=0.020 between groups) (Fig￾ure 2A, left). Without imputation of deaths, peak VO2
at 24 weeks decreased by ‒0.63±0.375 mL/min/kg in 
the control group (the difference of least square means 
0.48±0.398 mL/kg/min, P=0.23 between groups) (Fig￾ure 2A, right).
In the PP set (n=146), a similar difference between 
groups after 24 weeks was observed (ie, +0.25 mL/kg/
min for FCM versus ‒1.10 mL/kg/min in the standard of 
care group) (difference 1.32±0.51 mL/kg/min, P=0.011 
between groups; Figure 2B, left), but this was also not 
statistically significant anymore when no values were 
imputed (week 24 observed) for the patients who died 
(P=0.13; Figure 2B, right). 
At 12 weeks, the change in peak VO2
 was +0.25 mL/
min/kg for FCM versus ‒0.34 mL/min/kg for the usual 
care patients (difference 0.45±0.38; P=0.24 between 
groups; observed values).
The VE/carbon dioxide production slope was similar 
at baseline in the 2 groups and markedly elevated (ie, 
abnormal). Small changes occurred in both groups af￾ter 24 weeks (‒1.2 for FCM versus ‒1.1 for usual care 
patients), but no difference was found between groups 
(P=0.93). Patients with anemia (Hb <12 g/dL) did not 
benefit more from FCM than those without anemia (P
value for interaction 0.758), and in the group of pa￾tients treated with FCM, no association was discovered 
between the change in Hb and the change in peak VO2
(for FCM: r=‒0.0758, P=0.51) (Figure I in the online￾only Data Supplement). 
There was also no influence of where (which coun￾try) the patient was enrolled, and there was no differ￾ence between men and women in the effect of FCM.
Results of the different supportive sensitivity analyses 
showed findings that were generally similar using dif￾ferent modeling options, although a less robust effect 
was noted with no statistically significant difference be￾tween groups in the supportive analyses, which used 
only observed values (ie, those with no imputation for 
death) (data not shown).
Follow-Up
During the 24-week study, 4 patients died after 8, 51, 
106, and 146 days, all in the usual care group (1 ad￾ditional patient [usual care] died on day 190, ie, within 
30 days of completion of the study.) Two patients died 
suddenly, 1 was because of worsening HF, and 2 had 
complications during an episode of worsening HF (1 
sepsis, 1 respiratory failure).
A total of 58 hospitalizations occurred during the 
study in 40 patients (Table 2); 26 of them for worsen￾ing HF (13 in each group) in 17 patients (11 patients on

FCM and 6 on usual care). Sixteen other cardiovascular 
hospitalizations occurred in 15 patients. Thirteen of these 
hospitalizations were observed in 12 patients on FCM, 
and 3 other cardiovascular hospitalizations occurred in 3 
patients in the standard of care group (13 versus 3 hospi￾talizations, P<0.05 between groups). Of these 13 (other 
cardiovascular) hospitalizations in the FCM group, 3 were 
related to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (1 
malfunction, 1 elective new implantation, and 1 replace￾ment), 2 patients had an elective coronary angiography 
(planned before enrollment into the study), and 1 patient 
underwent an already planned ablation for atrial flutter. 
In the standard of care group, 1 patient had an appropri￾ate shock for ventricular fibrillation and survived. None 
of these hospitalizations was considered related to study 
drug administration by the attending physician.
In an additional (post hoc) analysis, we compared the 
number of patients with worsening HF or death. Eleven 
patients in the FCM were hospitalized for HF, and no 
deaths occurred. In the standard of care group, 4 pa￾tients died during the study (1 of them during a hospi￾talization for worsening HF), and 5 additional patients 
were hospitalized for worsening HF; 1 more patient had 
a cardiac arrest at home with documented ventricular 
fibrillation, for which he later received an implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator, which leads to 9+1 patients in 
the standard of care group.
Effects on Other Clinical Parameters 
and Safety
NYHA functional class was not significantly different at 
baseline in the 2 groups. After 6, 12, and 24 weeks, 
patients on FCM had improved their NYHA functional 
class significantly compared with patients in the control 
group (with imputation; all differences P<0.05) (Figure 
II in the online-only Data Supplement). The effect of 
FCM on NYHA class without imputation (observed val￾ues) was similar and also significantly different from the 
control group.
Patient global assessment was also similar at baseline 
and favorably affected by FCM compared with placebo. 
This difference was not present at 6 weeks but became 
evident at 12 and 24 weeks (with imputation; P<0.05 
between groups) (Figure III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The results without imputation (observed 
values) were remarkably similar and also significantly dif￾ferent at 12 and 24 weeks. BNP and NTproBNP were 
markedly elevated at baseline and were well balanced 
between groups. No significant effect of FCM compared 
with usual care was observed for BNP during the study. 
For NTproBNP, at 6 and 12 weeks no effect versus con￾trols was observed, but at 24 weeks a trend toward a 
lower increment in NTproBNP in the FCM group was ob￾served that was not statistically significant (+193 pg/mL 
versus +834 pg/mL for those on usual care; P=0.13 with 
LOCF, FAS population, n=172). In the PP analysis (n=146 
patients), this difference reached statistical significance 
in favor of FCM at 24 weeks (P=0.048 between groups). 
FCM was generally well tolerated. No hypersensitiv￾ity reactions to the drug occurred, and no cases of hy￾pophosphatemia were reported.
DISCUSSION
Iron deficiency is increasingly recognized as a serious 
comorbidity in patients with HF and is associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality. In the present study 
intravenous FCM administration successfully repleted 
iron stores and improved symptoms and well-being in 
patients. Although FCM may have an effect on peak 
VO2
, this cannot be conclusively determined from the 
present study because of the dependence of the find￾ing on the imputation method.
The present findings extend the earlier reported fa￾vorable effect of FCM on 6-minute walking distance, 
symptoms, and other clinical parameters in patients 
with HF and iron deficiency.9,10 In the first FAIR-HF trial 
(Ferinject Assessment in Patients With Iron Deficiency 
and Chronic Heart Failure),9
 459 patients with HF with 
iron deficiency were enrolled, and intravenous FCM was 
shown to improve symptoms, quality of life parameters, 
and 6-minute walking distance test after 24 weeks in 
patients with and without anemia. In the second study 
in 304 patients with HF, the CONFIRM-HF (Ferric Car￾boxymaltose Evaluation on Performance in Patients 
With Iron deficiency in Combination With Chronic Heart 
Failure),10 treatment with FCM for 1 year resulted in a 
beneficial effect on symptoms, functional capacity by 
6-minute walking test distance, and quality-of-life pa￾rameters. In addition, it also showed a reduction in the 
risk of first hospitalization for worsening HF compared 
with placebo (32 versus 10 events, P=0.009). In these 2 
studies, FCM was well tolerated, and the data have led 
to a class IIa recommendation for intravenous FCM (ie,

Ferric Carboxymaltose and Exercise in Heart Failure
Circulation. 2017;136:1374–1383. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027497 October 10, 2017 1381

it should be considered in “symptomatic patients with 
HF and reduced LVEF, in order to alleviate HF symptoms, 
and improve exercise capacity and quality of life” in 
the 2016 Guidelines for HF of the European Society of 
Cardiology).1
 Remarkably, iron deficiency is mentioned 
in neither the 2013 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association Guidelines for the Manage￾ment of Heart Failure17 nor in the 2016 Focused Update 
on New Pharmacological Therapy for Heart Failure.18
The mechanism of action of iron supplementation 
and exercise capacity in HF is still unclear. Besides its ef￾fect on Hb, iron has an important role in cellular oxygen 
storage and metabolism, especially in cells with a high 
energy demand such as cardiomyocytes and skeletal 
myocytes. In this process, mitochondria are the most 
important sites of iron utilization and energy produc￾tion. Animal experiments show that iron deficiency re￾sults in impaired exercise capacity, and that substitution 
of iron leads to normalization of their exercise capacity 
independent of Hb. Such data, however, are not avail￾able in humans, but it is conceivable that iron supple￾mentation affects either peripheral muscle or cardiac 
efficiency, but clearly more work is needed in this field.
Administration of oral iron is usually the first route to 
replete iron in patients with iron deficiency (with or with￾out anemia), which is common worldwide.19 However, 
oral iron supplementation may not be useful in all pa￾tients with iron deficiency because it is often not absorbed 
well.2,20 In patients with chronic kidney disease, oral iron 
administration was unable to maintain adequate serum 
ferritin levels, in contrast to intravenous iron supplemen￾tation, and the latter was also superior with regard to the 
hematopoietic response.20 However, until recently, such 
data in patients with HF were scarce.21 Recently, the data 
of the IRONOUT HF study (Oral Iron Repletion Effect on 
Oxygen Uptake in Heart Failure) , (NCT02188784)22 were 
published.23 In that study, 225 patients with symptom￾atic HF and iron deficiency were randomized to oral iron 
polysaccharide 150 mg bid or placebo, and the primary 
end point was change in peak VO2
 after 16 weeks. Oral 
iron did not affect peak VO2
 (or 6-minute walking dis￾tance) but also did not significantly increase serum fer￾ritin and was apparently not able to adequately replete 
iron stores. The authors concluded that “these results do 
not support use of oral iron supplementation in patients 
with HF and reduced LVEF.”23
Measurement of peak VO2
 during CPET is gener￾ally recognized as the gold standard of exercise capac￾ity and a predictor of outcome in HF.11,12,15,24 It is more 
expensive and time-consuming than a simple exercise 
test, but it is superior in the assessment of severity of 
disease and outcome. Nevertheless, measurement of 
peak VO2
 during CPET requires experienced staff. In the 
present study, all sites were well acquainted with CPET, 
and staff members were trained at the central core lab￾oratory. Also, all patients had performed ≥2 (baseline) 
tests before randomization (which had to differ <10%), 
and we believe this has resulted in high-quality data. 
Having said this, we must point out that this was a con￾trolled but open-label study, which may have caused 
bias. Indeed, despite that the CPET results were evalu￾ated blindly in a core laboratory, knowledge of treat￾ment assignment may have influenced the study. In 
the present study, we observed a difference between 
groups of 1.04 mL/kg/min (with LOCF analysis) in favor 
of FCM. Although this difference (7.5%) was smaller 
than expected, it may still be clinically relevant, and a 
recent study showed that every 6% change in peak VO2
was associated with a 5% difference in the primary end 
point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization.24
The handling of the deaths in the analysis of the 
present study deserves attention. Imputation of miss￾ing data in a study such as the present is notoriously 
difficult, and there is no perfect way to do this. The 
effect of FCM on peak VO2
 would be less and not sta￾tistically significant if we had not imputed. However, 
death in HF trial is a real and objective finding, and 
by the steering committee agreed (and laid out in the 
statistical analysis plan) at the start of the study to do 
it this way. Also, ignoring the deaths by not imput￾ing would have caused a selection and may lead to a 
biased estimation of the treatment effect. In contrast, 
hospitalizations for HF are much more difficult to assess 
and less objective, and large differences occur among 
countries in terms of criteria for hospital admission and 
organization. In general, the present study was clearly 
not powered to examine clinical events, and therefore 
the observed effects on deaths and hospitalizations 
must be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the to￾tal number of hospitalizations was higher in the FCM 
group (37 versus 21), which was mainly because of 
more hospitalizations for other cardiovascular reasons. 
An important part of these were because of elective 
procedures, which had been planned before enroll￾ment (and which of course could have taken place 
before the study). The number of hospitalizations for 
worsening HF was similar in the 2 groups, but this oc￾curred in slightly more patients on FCM. However, it 
is important to note that the total number of patients 
with clinically relevant events was in fact similar (11 
versus 10 patients), with 4 deaths in the standard of 
care arm and no deaths in patients on FCM. In a re￾cent meta-analysis,25 the effect of intravenous iron 
administration in patients with HF and iron deficiency 
on outcome was examined (from 5 controlled stud￾ies9,10,14,16,26) on 851 patients, of whom 509 received 
intravenous iron.9,10,14,16,26 In this meta-analysis, use of 
intravenous iron (versus controls) was associated with 
a reduction of the combined end points of all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations (odds 
ratio, 0.44; P<0.0001), and this finding was largely 
driven by a reduction in HF hospitalizations (odds ratio

for mortality, 0.83; P=0.56).25 The effect of FCM on 
outcome in HF will be investigated in 2 large trials: the 
AFFIRM-AHF (Study to Compare Ferric Carboxymaltose 
With Placebo in Patients With Acute Heart Failure and 
Iron Deficiency; NCT02937454; 1100 patients after a 
hospitalization for acute HF) and FAIR-HF 219 (1200 pa￾tients with chronic HF).
In conclusion, in patients with chronic HF and iron 
deficiency, intravenous iron supplementation with FCM 
has a beneficial effect on peak VO2
 compared with 
standard of care treatment, irrespective of the presence 
of baseline anemia. The effect of FCM on clinical out￾come in this population merits further study.

Supplementary Figure 1: Association between the change in Peak VO2 and the change in Hemoglobin at week 24 (LOCF). 
There was no association between the effect of FCM on Peak VO2 and the effect on Hemoglobin (r=-0.0758, p=0.51). 
Supplementary Figure 2: Effect of FCM on NYHA functional class

Values are changes compared to baseline and relative to the change in the control (standard of care) group, whereby an Odds ratio (OR) > 1.0 means effect in 
the FCM group is better than the standard of care group.
Supplementary Figure 3: Effect of FCM on PGA score.

Values are changes compared to baseline and relative to the change in the control (standard of care) group, whereby an Odds ratio (OR) > 1.0 means effect in 
the FCM group is better than the standard of care group.
