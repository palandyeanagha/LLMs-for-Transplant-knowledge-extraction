Abstract
Background
A longstanding disparity exists between the approaches to restorative surgery after
colectomy for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in England and Sweden. This study aims to
compare colectomy and restorative surgery rates in comparable national cohorts.
Method
The English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Swedish National Patient Register (NPR)
were interrogated between 2002 and April 2012. Patients with two diagnostic episodes for
UC, age 15 were included. Patients were excluded if they had an episode of inflammatory
bowel disease or colectomy before 2002. The cumulative incidences of colectomy and
restorative surgery were calculated using Kaplan‐Meier method.
Results
In total 98,691 patients were included in the study, 76,129 in England and 22,562 in
Sweden. The 5‐year cumulative incidence of all restorative surgery after colectomy in
England was 33% versus 46% in Sweden (p‐value <0.001). Of the patients undergoing
restorative surgery, 92.3% of English patients had a pouch versus 38.8% in Sweden and 7.7%
versus 59.1% respectively had an ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). The 5‐year cumulative
incidence of colectomy in this study cohort was 13% in England and 6% in Sweden (p‐value
<0.001).  
Conclusion
Following UC colectomy, only one third of English patients and half of Swedish patients
undergo restorative surgery. In England nearly all these patients underwent pouches, in
Sweden a less significant majority underwent IRAs.    It is surprising to demonstrate this
discrepancy in a comparable cohort of patients from similar healthcare systems. The causes
and consequences of this international variation in management are not fully understood
and require further investigation.
   

What does this paper add to the literature?
Using nationwide administrative healthcare data this study suggests that fewer patients
undergo restorative surgery after colectomy for ulcerative colitis in England than in Sweden.
Ileoanal pouches are more common in England and ileorectal anastomoses in Sweden.
These results have the potential to influence the management of UC in both countries.  
Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the
rectum and colon in a retrograde pattern of inflammation, starting at the rectum. The
majority of patients are managed with medical therapy, however a significant minority will
eventually require colectomy (1). The reported 5‐year and 10‐year cumulative risks of
colectomy range between 3‐13% and 10‐25%, respectively, but no nationwide study has
been performed (2).
In order to live without a permanent ileostomy following a colectomy, patients may choose
to undergo restorative surgery in the form of an ileal pouch, ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) or
continent ileostomy. In the UK the ileal pouch is the most popular restorative option, but in
Sweden patients are more likely to receive an IRA after colectomy (3). In Sweden it has
previously been shown that less than half of the patients underwent further restorative
surgery after a colectomy for IBD (4). Whether the situation is similar in England is
unknown, and whether the cumulative risk of colectomy could explain potential differences
needs further exploration.  
This study aims to utilise national routinely collected administrative data to investigate the
differences in the surgical management of patients with UC in England and Sweden,
particularly in regard to the comparative likelihood of patients undergoing restorative
surgery after colectomy in the two countries.
Method
The English nationwide registers
The English National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data have been
described previously (5). They include diagnostic, procedural, demographic and

geographical data for all NHS secondary care episodes in England. There is a very small
minority of patients receiving private healthcare in NHS hospitals. The HES data are linked to
Office of National Statistics (ONS) data to record death outside of hospital. HES have been
recorded for patients admitted to hospital care since 1989 and outpatient secondary care
since 2003. The accuracy has increased significantly after the introduction of Payment by
Results (PbR) in 2003 and the Audit Commission review of 2009 to 2010 concluded
procedural coding (using the Office of Population Census and Surveys version 4 (OPCS4))
accuracy of 90% and diagnostic coding (using the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems version 10 (ICD‐10)) accuracy of 89%, although this
will be higher if only three‐digit diagnostic coding is used, as is the case in this study (6).  
The Swedish nationwide registers
The Swedish nationwide population‐based registers of patient care, cancer, causes of death,
and emigration were used (7–9). The Swedish health care service is available to all residents,
to whom unique personal identification numbers are assigned, making it possible to identify
all residents and follow them through register linkages (10). Swedish inpatient diagnoses
have been registered in the National Patient Register (NPR) since January 1, 1964, with a
nationwide coverage since 1987. Since January 1, 2001, non‐primary outpatient care has
been registered in the Patient Register. The Swedish NPR also uses ICD‐10 diagnostic codes
since 1997, but uses Nordic Medico‐Statistical Committee (NOMESCO) procedural codes.
Study population
The nationwide English and Swedish data were used to identify incident cases of UC
between April 1997 and April 2012.   Patients were included in the study if they had two
separate events (inpatient episodes including endoscopy visits and visits for administration
of biologic drugs in England, and inpatient or non‐primary outpatient episodes in Sweden)
with a primary or secondary diagnostic code for UC (ICD‐10: K51) between January 2002 and
April 2012. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed with UC before the age of 15.
Patients were also excluded from the study if they had a diagnostic episode for UC or
Crohn’s Disease (CD, ICD‐10: K50), colectomy or restorative surgery before 2002. A ‘washout

period’ of at least five years was utilised to select a population who had neither been
diagnosed with IBD nor underwent a colectomy before 2002.
Patients were followed longitudinally from their first episode with a diagnostic code for UC
until the 30th of April 2012, date of death or date of emigration (in Sweden only), which ever
came first.
UC surgery
The OPCS and NOMESCO procedural codes are included in appendix 1 for England and
Sweden respectively, and were used to identify patients in whom colectomy and restorative
procedures (IRA, pouch or continent ileostomy) were performed. Primary IRA and pouch
surgery were defined as procedures performed in conjunction with the colectomy, whereas
secondary IRA and pouch surgery were restorative surgeries performed at a later stage.  
Only the first restorative surgery was accounted for. On preliminary analysis of the English
data it was clear that the code for continent ileostomy (G74.1) was used inaccurately as a
code for ileostomy, with over 400 recorded procedures. This code was excluded from the
English analysis.
Co‐variates
Patients were classified into five categories according to age at UC diagnosis (15‐29, 30‐44,
45‐59, ≥60 years). The same cut‐offs were used for age at colectomy. Five categories were
used to classify year of UC diagnosis (2002‐2003, 2004‐2005, 2006‐2007, 2008‐2009, 2010‐
2012 (April)), and the same categories were used for year of colectomy. Presence of a
diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (the international classification of diseases, tenth
revision (ICD10): K83.0) were extracted from the registers at the time of UC diagnosis as
well as at the time of colectomy. The Cancer Register was used in Sweden to identify
diagnosis of colorectal cancer (ICD7: 153 and 1540) before UC diagnosis and at the time of
colectomy. In England ICD10 codes for colorectal cancer were used: C18‐C20.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic and diagnostic variables shared
between both national registries as described above. The cumulative incidence of colectomy

and restorative surgery were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method, and the log‐rank
test was used to calculate p‐values. English HES data were analysed in SPSS (IBM Corp. IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and Swedish data with
Stata 14 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Statistical tests were 2‐sided, and statistical significance was
set at p൑0.05. The researchers only had access to de‐identified data. The study had been
approved by the Ethical vetting board in London (HRA NRES 2013: REC Reference
13/LO/1235), and in Stockholm, Sweden, (DNR of ethical approvals including amendments:
2007/785‐31/5; 2015/1030‐32). The study is reported as per the STROBE guidelines (11).
Sensitivity analysis
The total national populations were also used as denominators, using the 2007 population
for each country as this was the mid‐point of follow up (12,13).
Results
In total 98,691 patients were included in the study, 76,129 in England and 22,562 in Sweden
(figure 1).  Table 1 shows the demographic data for patients included in the study. The sex
distribution was similar in the two cohorts, the median age at the first UC episode was
younger in the Swedish cohort (42 years vs 52 years).   The maximum length of follow‐up
was 10 years, 3 months. The mean average length of follow‐up was 5.15 years in the English
cohort, 5.27 in the Swedish cohort.
Colectomies
During follow‐up 10,557 colectomies were performed. Colectomies were performed in 12%
(n=9,118) of the English patients and 6% (n=1,439) of the Swedish patients (figure 1 and
Table 2). There was no difference in age at colectomy, or presence of colorectal cancer prior
to colectomy, but more Swedish patients had diagnostic codes for primary sclerosing
cholangitis listed in admissions up to the time of colectomy (3% vs 1%). The cumulative
incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 13% in England and 6% in Sweden (table 3 and figure
2) (p‐value <0.001).  
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the total population as the denominator (table 4).  
The UC study cohorts per 2007 population  ‐    76,129/51,381,100 in England and

22,562/9,182,927 in Sweden accounts to raw prevalence of 1.5/105 and 2.5/105
respectively. The gross colectomy rates per capita of the total country population are
0.18/105 in England (9,118/51,381,100) and 0.16/105 in Sweden (1,439/9,182,927) (p‐value
<0.001).  
Restorative surgery
The crude rate of restorative surgery after colectomy in England was 29.6% versus 41.4% in
Sweden. Table 5 and figure 3 show that the cumulative incidence in England and Sweden at
one year was 0.24 and 0.29, at three years 0.32 and 0.43, and at five years 0.33 and 0.46,
respectively (p‐value <0.001).  
After colectomy in England and Sweden, 27.6% vs 16.1% of patients underwent pouch
operations and 2.3% vs 24.5% underwent IRA respectively. As a proportion of restorative
procedures, pouches accounted for 92.3% in England and 38.8% in Sweden, and IRAs 7.7%
and 59.1%, respectively.   
Discussion
The main finding from this study is that the rate of restorative surgery for UC patients
undergoing colectomy is lower in England than in Sweden. Only one third of patients in
England underwent a restorative procedure within five years of undergoing a colectomy
compared with nearly half in Sweden. The data have also confirmed that the choice of
restorative procedure differs in the two countries. During the study period 92% of the
English patients undergoing restorative surgery had an ileal pouch, whereas in Sweden 59%
of restorative procedures were an IRA and only 39% a pouch. The study suggests that the
colectomy rate is higher in England than in Sweden, but this finding should be treated with
caution and is discussed later in this section.
This paper reports the first international comparison of two nationwide cohorts of patients
with UC undergoing surgery. As global benchmarking and shared international experience in
healthcare are becoming more commonplace, this study contributes to the literature by
highlighting discrepancy in the management of the same condition in two developed
healthcare systems.

Surprisingly only one third of the UC patients in England underwent restorative surgery
following a colectomy. The corresponding number was higher in Sweden, but still under
50%. The reasons for this comparatively low proportion of young patients undergoing
restorative surgery are uncertain. The reasons for the surprisingly low rate of restorative
surgery are unknown and likely multifactorial. For a patient to undergo restorative surgery
for UC there are patient and surgeon/hospital related factors. The patient must be a
suitable candidate in regard to their sphincter function and disease‐related factors, they
must be aware of the option for restorative surgery and have a preference for avoiding a
permanent ileostomy. The surgical team must ensure that the patient is well informed and
given a balanced view regarding a permanent ileostomy versus restorative surgery. Previous
research in Sweden and New York has suggested that patients undergoing their colectomy
in low volume restorative surgery centres have a lower risk of subsequent restorative
surgery (4,14). In New York the patient‐related factors influenced subsequent pouch surgery
more than surgeon‐related factors. It is not known if the same volume outcome relationship
is true in England and this should be the subject of future research.  
One difference between the two countries is the surgical procedure employed. In England,
almost all patients received a pouch and in Sweden IRA was the most commonly used
technique. The long‐term implications for quality of life when comparing reconstruction
with a pouch to IRA are yet to be established. One perceived advantage with pouch surgery
is the lower failure rate when compared to that following an IRA (15–17). It should, however
be noted that failure of an ileal pouch necessitates permanent ileostomy (although
conversion to continent ileostomy is technically possible but rarely performed (18)),
whereas failure of an IRA leaves the option of conversion to a pouch. In a previous Swedish
NPR study including 265 patients in whom the IRA failed, 76 (28.7%) were converted to a
pouch. The function following conversion of IRA to pouch seems reasonable in patients with
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis patients, and probably in patients with UC (19,20). Another
disadvantage with IRA is the potential risk of cancer, and yearly surveillance of the rectal
remnant is needed (21,22).  
IRAs have the perceived advantage of being less technically demanding and, in combination
with careful patient selection and medical management of the rectal remnant, may
represent an interim measure for some patients requiring colectomy. An algorithm for the

management of the rectum after colectomy has been published previously, and includes
topical 5‐ASA enemas to reduce inflammation and increase rectal compliance (23).
Beyond the advantages and disadvantages described above, it is not known why the
discrepancy in the choice of restorative options exists between England and Sweden. The
pouch was developed and popularised in the UK, but this does not explain the preference in
North America and many other European countries. It is possible that ulcerative colitis is
phenotypically different in Sweden, with relative rectal sparing and so IRAs are better
tolerated by patients. It may be explained by the greater geographical distances to specialist
colorectal hospitals in Sweden, making access to surgeons performing pouch surgery more
difficult than in the UK. These points are speculative, and should be answered in further
research studies. There has been a reappraisal of the IRA in Sweden prompted by the desire
to avoid the impact on female fecundity associated with pelvic surgery. There are now more
effective medical treatment options and more sensitive endoscopic surveillance than when
the pouch was developed and in very select patients an IRA is an appropriate first
restorative procedure (23).
This is the first nationwide study comparing the cumulative risk of colectomy in UC patients
in two countries. The 5‐year cumulative risk of colectomy was lower in Sweden than in
England. When interpreting the English data, it should be noted that it is difficult to define
the true size of the UC population due to a lack of reliable outpatient diagnostic coding
(therefore outpatient HES data were not used for this study). The HES data for admitted
patient care used for this study do include endoscopy visits and administration of high cost
medications by infusion. Because of the likelihood of a patient with UC requiring at least one
endoscopy over a 10‐year period, and most patients undergo an endoscopy at the time of
UC diagnosis, we believed that most UC patients would be captured. Given, however that
the five‐year cumulative risk of colectomy in England was twice as high as in Sweden but the
number of UC colectomies per 100,000 total population were similar in the two countries, it
is likely that not all English UC patients were identified. The NPR has more reliable
outpatient data and has been validated for capturing IBD patients with a positive predictive
value for true IBD of 93% with two diagnoses of IBD and 79% for two diagnoses of UC (24).

The validity of HES for identifying patients with IBD has not been confirmed in a similar
fashion.  
This study is a unique comparison of the surgical management of comparable nationwide
cohorts of UC patients from two healthcare systems in which universal patient identification
allows longitudinal tracking. Nationwide, population‐based data collected in routine medical
care reflects real‐world practice as opposed to the strict conditions of controlled trials, and
the very large sample size results in excellent precision. The 10‐year follow up period is
adequate, as over 90% of patients undergoing restorative surgery have done so by three
years after colectomy. A washout period of at least five years was used to ensure that we
captured only incident cases. The Swedish cohort is based on the NPR with a complete
registration of in‐hospital as well as outpatient visits, and a validated method of capturing
IBD cases. The English cohort is based on HES data with validated accuracy regarding
diagnostic and procedural coding (25). However, it is possible that not all English UC
patients were identified in the HES data, and that the true cumulative risk of colectomy is
indeed lower than reported in this study. It should be noted that this weakness is unlikely to
affect the capture of true UC colectomies as HES covers all of the inpatient population.
Therefore, the gross number of colectomies and the rate of restorative surgery can be
considered reliable.
In regard to other weaknesses of the methodology some are inherent to all international
comparison studies of administrative healthcare data; namely procedural coding
discrepancies, clinician versus professional coder input of data, limited comparable clinical
outcome measures (26). As in most registry studies there was no detailed clinical
information available. It is possible that the differences in colectomy and restorative rates
between England and Sweden could be explained by differences in disease phenotype and
administrated drugs – information that could not be attained reliably in both data sets.
This study raises questions in how gastroenterology and colorectal management practices
differ in the two countries in regard to counselling and preparing patients for permanent
stoma, pouch or IRA.  Also it questions what the long term quality of life implications are for
patients reconstructed with a pouch versus and IRA.

Conclusion
Following a UC colectomy, only one third of English patients and nearly half of Swedish
patients undergo restorative surgery. In England, nearly all these patients underwent
pouches and a less significant majority in Sweden underwent IRAs.    It is surprising to
demonstrate such a discrepancy in a comparable cohort of patients from two similar
healthcare systems. The reasons for and consequences of this international variation in
management are not fully understood and require further investigation to establish the best
possible care for patients requiring surgery for UC.
