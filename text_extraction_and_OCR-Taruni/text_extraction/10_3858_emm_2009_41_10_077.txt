Abstract
In addition to CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
 regulatory T (Treg) 
cells which protect against autoimmune tissue injury, 
IL-17-producing CD4+
 T (Th17) cells have been recently 
described and shown to play a crucial role in auto￾immune injury. It appears that there is a reciprocal de￾velopmental pathway between Th17 and Treg cells. 
Although IL-17 is known to be associated with allograft 
rejection, the cellular source of IL-17 and the nature of 
Th17 in the context of allograft rejection remain 
unknown. In the current study, the dynamics of Treg and 
IL-17-producing cells after syngeneic and allogeneic 
transplantation were examined using a wild-type mur￾ine cardiac transplantation model. Ly6G+
 cells were 
found to produce IL-17 during the early postoperative 
period and CD8+
 as well as CD4+
 T cells were also found 
to produce IL-17 during alloimmune response. 
Graft-infiltrating Ly6G+
, CD4+
, and even CD8+
 cells 
were found to express IL-17 highly compared to those 
in spleen. Although the frequencies of Th17 and Treg
were found to gradually increase in both syngeneic and 
allogeneic recipients, Th17/Treg ratios were signi￾ficantly higher in recipients with allograft rejection 
than in syngeneic recipients. In conclusion, IL-17 is 
produced by neutrophils during the early post￾operative period and subsequently by Th17 and CD8+
T cells during allograft rejection. Th17/Treg imbalance 
is associated with the development of allograft 
rejection. This study would provide basic information 
on Th17 biology for future investigation in the field of 
transplantation.

Introduction
CD4+
 helper T cells proliferate and differentiate into 
effector T cell subsets with specific cytokine pheno￾types in response to antigen-specific activation. T 
helper (Th) cells are traditionally classified as Th1 
and Th2 cells based on their cytokine-expression 
profiles (Mosmann et al., 1989). In particular, Th1 
cells produce IFN-γ, which enhances cellular 
immunity and is required for the clearance of 
intracellular organisms. On the other hand, Th2 
cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-25, which 
enhance humoral immunity and are important for 
IgE production, eosinophilic inflammation, and the 
elimination of helminthic infections (Abbas et al., 
1996). However, recent murine experiments have 
changed this Th1/Th2 paradigm by demonstrating 
that CD4+
 Th cells can differentiate into Th17 cells, 
which produce IL-17 and play a crucial role in 
inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Aggarwal 
et al., 2003; Cua et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 
2005). In addition, CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
 regulatory T 
(Treg) cells have also been described as a distinct 
subset from Th1 and Th2 cells. Treg cells play an 
anti-inflammatory role and maintain tolerance to 
self-components by contact-dependent suppression 
or by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, such 
as, IL-10 and TGF-β (Ng et al., 2001; Dieckmann 
et al., 2002; Fontenot et al., 2003; Sakaguchi et al., 
2006). Furthermore, the productions of Th17 and 
Treg cells appear to be mutually exclusive (Bettelli 
et al., 2006; Mucida et al., 2007) and therefore, the 
balance between Treg and Th17 cells may be 
important during the development of autoimmune 
diseases (Homey, 2006).
 Recent studies have established that IL-17 re-

leased by Th17 cells plays key roles during the 
pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune ence￾phalitis (Langrish et al., 2005), rheumatoid arthritis 
(Kotake, 1999; Cho et al., 2008), inflammatory 
bowel disease (Fujino et al., 2003), psoriasis 
(Zheng et al., 2007) and uveitis (Amadi-Obi et al., 
2007). However, the role of Th17 and its archetypal 
cytokine, IL-17, is unclear in transplantation immu￾nity. Some studies have shown that IL-17 is asso￾ciated with acute allograft rejection. In a rat renal 
allograft transplantation model, IL-17 mRNA levels 
were found to peak on postoperative day 5, and 
then decline (Loong et al., 2002). Furthermore, the 
acute rejection of aortic allografts was prevented 
and cardiac allograft survival was prolonged by 
neutralizing IL-17 with an IL-17R:IgG-Fc fusion 
protein (Tang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2006). Although 
these data may suggest that Th17 cells potentially 
impact acute allograft rejection, the cellular source 
of IL-17, and the nature of Th17 cells during allo￾graft rejection remain unknown. 
 Accordingly, we first analyzed the dynamic diffe￾rentiations of Treg, Th17, and other IL-17+
 cells, 
including neutrophils and CD8+
 T cells, in the context 
of murine cardiac transplantations. We then eva￾luated the significances of Th17/Treg balance during 
allograft rejection.
Results
Histopathological changes
The extent of coagulative myocyte necrosis (CMN), 
the most definitive characteristic of ischemic heart 
injury, was diagnosed in both groups of syngeneic 
and allogeneic recipients as grade 2 at 3 days and 
grade 1 at 5 days after transplantation (Figure 1A 
and 1B). Furthermore, regardless of transplan￾tation group, at day 3, sections of cardiac grafts 
showed predominant neutrophil infiltration, regarded 
as archetypal cells of ischemic reperfusion injury. 
The grade of acute cellular rejection (ACR) 
deteriorated with time; grade 1R at day 3 and 
grade 2R at day 5 after transplantation (Figure 1C 
and 1D). Sections of allografts showed charac￾teristic mononuclear cell infiltration during acute 
cellular rejection. Complete rejection of cardiac 
allografts occurred at 7.8 ± 0.12 days after trans￾plantation. Histopathological features of cardiac 
graft recipients were summarized in Figure 1E.
Serial changes in serum levels of cytokines 
Serum levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ were quantitated 
using Bio-PlexⓇ kits in untransplanted control B6 
mice (day 0), allogeneic (BALB/C → B6) recipients, 
and syngeneic (B6 → B6) recipients on days 1, 3, 
and 5 after transplantation (Figure 2). To determine 
whether increased production of IL-17 after cardiac 
transplantation is alloantigen-specific, we initially 
evaluated serial changes in the IL-17 serum levels 
after transplantation and compared the two study 
groups in this respect. In both allogeneic and 
syngeneic recipients, serum levels of IL-17 peaked 
on day 3, which corresponded to grade 2 CMN and 
grade 1R ACR (308.0 ± 74.9 pg/ml vs. 300.1 ±
63.1 pg/ml for allogeneic and syngeneic recipients, 
respectively), and these values were significantly 
greater than in naïve B6 mice (P ＜ 0.05). How￾ever, on day 5, allogeneic recipients showed a 
sustained increase in IL-17 serum levels (285 ±
16.6 pg/ml), which contrasted significantly with that

kit. (A) IL-17 serum levels were peaked on the 3rd postoperative day and then decreased in both groups. However, allogeneic recipients had continuously 
higher IL-17 levels on the 5th postoperative day. (B) The serum levels of IFN-γ were elevated on the 5th postoperative day in allogeneic recipients. These 
changes in IL-17 serum levels suggest IL-17 production in vivo is associated with ischemic reperfusion injury during the early postoperative period and 
then accompanied by alloimmune responses during acute rejection. *P ＜ 0.05 between the two groups on specific postoperative days. 
observed in syngeneic recipients (236.1 ± 11.9 
pg/ml) (P ＜ 0.05). As illustrated in Figure 2B, 
serum levels of IFN-γ did not change significantly 
with time in syngeneic recipients (P = ns). On the 
other hand, in allogeneic recipients, serum levels 
of IFN-γ peaked on day 5 and showed significant 
elevations over other time points (P ＜ 0.05). The 
results of this work led us to assume that IL-17 
production in vivo is due to neutrophils contributing 
to ischemic reperfusion injury during the early 
postoperative period, which is then accompanied 
by alloimmune responses during acute rejection. 
Serial changes in the frequencies of IL-17+
 cells and 
Treg cells among splenocytes
To evaluate this hypothesis, concerning the sequen￾tial evolution of IL-17 response after transplanta￾tion, we examined the phenotype of IL-17+
 spleno￾cytes using flow cytometry. In agreement with our 
hypothesis, the frequencies of Ly6G+
IL-17+
 cells 
(Ly6G+
IL-17+
/Ly6G+
 cells) peaked on day 3 (2.94
± 1.50 and 4.0 ± 1.35%, respectively for alloge￾neic and syngeneic recipients), and thereafter 
decreased in both groups (Figure 3C, P ＜ 0.05). 
The mean frequency of Th17 (CD4+
IL-17+
/CD4+
 T 
cells) in naïve B6 mice was 0.32 ± 0.08% (Figure 
3A). However, after cardiac transplantation, Th17 
frequencies peaked on day 5 in allogeneic reci￾pients (P ＜ 0.05). Allogeneic recipients showed 
high Th17 frequencies on day 5 (1.70 ± 0.20%), 
which were significantly higher than Th17 frequen￾cies in the syngeneic group at this time (0.98 ±
0.17) (P ＜0.05). Allogeneic recipients also showed 
significantly elevated CD8+
IL-17+
 T cell (CD8+
IL-17+
/ 
CD8+
 T cells) frequencies on day 5 (Figure 3B, P 
＜ 0.05). Furthermore, allogeneic recipients had a 
higher mean frequency of CD8+
IL-17+
 T cells on 
day 5 (1.95 ± 0.3%) than syngeneic recipients 
(1.16 ± 0.2%) (P = 0.063). 
 Treg cells constituted 4.58 ±0.2% of CD4+
 T cells 
in naïve B6 mice. The frequencies of Treg cells 
(CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
/CD4+
 T cells) increased progre￾ssively until day 5 in both syngeneic (6.52 ± 0.3%) 
and allogeneic (6.19 ±0.6%) recipients (Figure 3D, 
P ＜0.05). As shown in Figure 4, IL-17 producing 
CD4+
 T cells were predominantly CD4+
CD25+
 T 
cells. However, CD4+
CD25+
 T cells were mostly 
negative for IL-17, and CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
IL-17+
 T 
cells were virtually undetectable.
 To ascertain whether the balance between pro￾inflammatory Th17 and anti-inflammatory Treg is 
disrupted during acute rejection, the ratio of Th17 
to Treg was evaluated. With progression of allo￾graft rejection, allogeneic recipients had higher 
Th17/Treg ratios, i.e., allogeneic recipients had 
significantly higher Th17/Treg ratios on day 5 than 
on days 0 and 1 and also had significantly higher 
Th17/Treg ratios on day 5 than syngeneic reci￾pients (Figure 5). 
Expression of IL-17 in graft-infiltrating cells
To assess longitudinal changes in graft-infiltrating 
IL-17+
 cells after transplantation, we used double 
immunofluorescent staining and confocal analysis. 
It was found that neutrophils (Ly6G+

CD4+
 T cells (Figure 6D-F), and CD8+
 T cells

(Figure 6G-I) were IL-17-positive. In both synge￾neic and allogeneic grafts, Ly6G+
 cells highly ex￾pressed IL-17 during the early postoperative period. 
In allogeneic grafts, on days 3 and 5, 13.1 ± 1.3% 
and 9.3 ± 1.2% of graft-infiltrating Ly6G+
 cells 
expressed IL-17, respectively. Likewise, in synge￾neic grafts, 12.3 ± 1.1% and 5.9 ± 0.5% of 
graft-infiltrating Ly6G+
 cells expressed IL-17. Graft￾infiltrating Th17 and CD8+
IL-17+
 T cells were iden￾tified only in allografts. Th17 cells (9.1 ± 1.3% of 
CD4+
 T cells) were demonstrated only on day 3, 
which corresponded to early acute rejection. In 
accord with our flow cytometry results, CD8+
 as 
well as CD4+
 T cells labeled for IL-17 during the 
acute rejection period. CD8+
 T cells expressed IL-17 
on day 3 (13.3 ± 0.9%) and day 5 (11.7 ± 1.9%).

Discussion
The role of Th1 and Th2 cells in acute allograft 
rejection has been widely investigated and the 
Th1/Th2 model has been used as a framework to 
explain the mechanism involved. Increased pro￾duction of IFN-γ, a prototypic cytokine of Th1 
response, and mononuclear cell infiltration of the 
graft are commonly associated with acute allograft 
rejection. Thus, Th1 cells are generally considered 
to be the main mediators of allograft rejection 
(Chan et al., 1995). On the other hand, Th2 cells

were initially predicted to promote unresponsi￾veness and to be associated with the induction of 
transplant tolerance. However, Th2-mediated rejec￾tion has been also reported to be involved in allo￾graft rejection through graft infiltration by eosino￾phils, especially under conditions in which IFN-γ is 
depleted (Martinez et al., 1993; Bishop et al., 
2001). However, this Th1/Th2 paradigm has been 
recently challenged by the finding that IL-17 is 
associated with allograft rejection, which suggests 
that Th17 may participate in transplant immunity 
(Van Kooten et al., 1998; Tang et al., 2001; Loong 
et al., 2002; Li et al., 2006). Furthermore, it has 
been reported that IL-17 is produced by Th17, 
Figure 4. Treg cells scarcely produced IL-17 in allogeneic murine cardiac 
transplant recipients. (A) More than 60% of CD4+

Figure 5. The Th17/Treg balance was disrupted with progression of allo￾geneic cardiac graft rejection. The ratio of Th17 to Treg cells were calcu￾lated using flow cytometric data of splenocytes in syngeneic and alloge￾neic murine cardiac transplant recipients. Allogeneic recipients showed 
higher Th17/Treg ratio on day 5 than on day 0 and day 1. On the 5th post￾operative day, allogeneic recipients also had significantly higher Th17/Treg
ratios than syngeneic recipients. *P＜ 0.05. 
natural killer, natural killer T, γδ T, and CD8+
 T cells, 
and even by neutrophils (Kryczek et al., 2007; 
Weaver et al., 2007; Hoshino et al., 2008). Yuan 
and colleagues reported that CD4Th17 cells 
mediate accelerated vascular rejection and vascu￾lopathy in T-bet-/- mice which exhibit profound 
deficiency in Th1 response (Yuan et al., 2008). 
Thus, it would appear that the cellular source of 
IL-17 and the dynamics of IL-17-producing cells 
should be investigated in a wild-type transplanta￾tion model without pre-conditioning. 
 In the present study, we initially evaluated changes 
in IL-17 serum levels after cardiac transplantation 
in syngeneic and allogeneic recipients. In agree￾ment with previous studies (Hsieh et al., 2001; 
Loong et al., 2002), we found that the serum level 
of IL-17 peaked on day 3 and declined thereafter in 
both recipient types (Figure 2A). However, on day 
5, allogeneic recipients showed a continuously 
increased serum level of IL-17 whereas syngeneic 
recipients did not. This finding suggests that IL-17 
is produced by innate immunity during the early 
postoperative period, and that IL-17 production is 
enhanced by allogeneic immunity during allograft 
rejection. To confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed 
the phenotype of IL-17+
 splenocytes by flow cyto￾metry. On day 3, Ly6G+
 cells were found to express 
IL-17 highly in both syngeneic and allogeneic 
recipients. However, on day 5, in contrast to 
syngeneic recipients, allogeneic recipients showed 
a high proportion of Th17 and CD8+
IL-17+
 T cells 
(Figure 3). Interestingly, IL-17 expression was 
comparable in CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells in allogeneic 
recipients. Thus, our findings lead us to conclude 
that neutrophils that contribute to ischemic reper￾fusion injury produce mainly IL-17 during the early 
postoperative period and that CD8+
 as well as 
CD4+
 T cells secrete IL-17 during acute allograft 
rejection due to an adaptive immune response. 
 The second important finding of the present 
study arose from double-labeling confocal analysis. 
Specifically, IL-17+
 cells were found to contain a 
rather higher proportion of Ly6G+
, CD4+
 and CD8+
T cells in grafts (up to 15%) than in spleen, which 
may have been due to the in vivo microenviron￾ment. Similar results have been reported by Tzartos 
et al. (2008) in a study on multiple sclerosis (MS) in 
which IL-17+
 T cells were found to be associated 
with increased activity in MS lesion, and reported 
by Korn et al. (2007) in an experimental allergic 
encephalitis model, in which IL-17+
 cells were de￾tected in the inflamed CNS, but not in the draining 
lymph nodes. In the present study, CD8+
IL-17+
 T 
cells were identified for up to 5 days in allografts 
after cardiac transplantation, whereas Th17 cells 
were detected only on day 3 (Table 1). This 
contradicts an observation by Langrish et al. 
(2005) that IL-17+
 cells were mainly composed of 
CD4+
 T cells in an EAE model. This apparent diffe￾rence may be due to the relative predominance of 
CD8+
 T cells during cardiac allograft rejection 
(Burrell et al., 2008). 
 It has been reported that there is a dichotomy in 
the generation of Th17 that induces autoimmunity 
and Treg that inhibits autoimmune tissue injury 
(Bettelli et al., 2006; Mucida et al., 2007). Thus, the 
balance between Th17 and Treg cells may be 
important in induction or regulation of tissue 
inflammation. This leads to the third major finding 
of the present study; we demonstrated for the first 
time that Th17/Treg balance is disrupted during 
allograft rejection. We observed that the frequen￾cies of Th17 (Figure 3A) and Treg cells (Figure 3D) 
among CD4+
 T cells gradually and concomitantly 
increased after cardiac transplantation in both 
allogeneic and syngeneic recipients, but that the 
Th17/Treg ratio on day 5 was significantly higher in 
allogeneic than in syngeneic recipients (Figure 5). 
This suggests that the disruption of the balance 
between Th17 and Treg is associated with the 
development of allograft rejection, as well. Similarly, 
Cheng et al. (2008) also found that a Th17/Treg 
functional imbalance exists in patients with acute 
coronary syndrome (including unstable angina and 
acute myocardial infarction). 
 Finally, Benghiat et al. (2008) reported that Th17 
cells could be part of CD25+
 memory T cells and

that isolation of nTregs solely on CD25 expression 
may lead to undesired selection of them. Likewise, 
in the present study, a considerable amount of Th17 
cells were found to be positive for CD25, which is 
also a marker for activated T cells, whereas Foxp3+
Tregs were found to scarcely express IL-17 (Figure 
4). However, as CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
 regulatory T 
cells can induce CD4+
CD25-Foxp3-
 T cells to 
become Th17 cells and can differentiate into Th17 
cells (Xu et al., 2007), close attention should be 
paid to the selection of Tregs and also to the 
development of the Th17 responses during 
Tregs-based immunotherapy.
 Altogether, the present study demonstrates the 
dynamic differentiation of IL-17-producing cells, 
including Ly6G+
 (neutrophils), CD4+
 and CD8+
 T 
cells in the context of allograft rejection, in a 
wild-type murine cardiac transplant model. We 
found that neutrophils produce IL-17 during the 
early postoperative period and that CD8+
 as well 
as CD4+
 T cells produce IL-17 during allograft 
rejection. In addition, our findings also demonstrate 
that IL-17+
 cells contain higher proportions of 
Ly6G+
 cells, CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells in cardiac grafts 
than in spleens. Finally, Th17/Treg ratios were found 
to be significantly higher during allograft rejection, 
which suggests that Th17 to Treg imbalance plays a 
role in the development of allograft rejection. To 
draw firm conclusion, however, it needs an allograft 
transplantation model where only some of the 
recipients accept the graft. The Th17/Treg balances 
between allogeneic acceptor and rejector groups 
would be compared to test whether the balance is 
disrupted in the rejector group. 
 In spite of an observational study, this study 
would provide basic information on Th17 biology in 
transplant immunity, which needs further investi￾gation.

Female C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) and BALB/C (H-2d) mice were 
purchased from Japan SLC (Kotoh-cho, Japan), and 
housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility. Mice 
were routinely used at about 8 weeks of age. This study 
was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use 

714 Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 41(10), 707-716, 2009
Committee (IACUC) of the Clinical Research Institute at 
Seoul National University Hospital. This facility is accre￾dited by the Association for the Assessment and Accre￾ditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. 
Heterotopic cardiac transplantation
For allogeneic transplantations, BALB/C and B6 mice were 
used as donors and recipients (the allogeneic group), 
respectively, and for syngeneic transplantations group, B6 
mice were used as donors and recipients (the syngeneic 
group). Heterotopic cardiac transplantations were perfor￾med with microsurgical technique in a similar manner as 
previously described (Corry et al., 1973; Niimi, 2001). 
Briefly, donor hearts were harvested after cool perfusion 
with heparinized lactated Ringer's solution and then placed 
into cooled lactated Ringer’s solution while the recipients 
were prepared for transplantation. The graft aorta was 
anastomosed to the recipient abdominal aorta and the graft 
pulmonary artery was anastomosed to the recipient inferior 
vena cava. Effective ventricular contraction usually occurred 
within 30 s after reperfusion.
Histology
Cardiac grafts were recovered at several time points after 
transplantation, fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded, 
serially sectioned at 4 μm, and stained with H&E by routine 
technique. At least two separate slides were examined to 
assess myocyte viability and acute rejection. The extent of 
coagulative myocyte necrosis (CMN), which is the most 
definitive manifestation of ischemic myocyte injury, was 
graded semiquantitatively (Fyfe et al., 1996; Tan et al., 
2007): grade 0, no evidence of CMN; grade 1, mild (focal) 
CMN; grade 2, moderate (multifocal) CMN; and grade 3, 
severe (confluent) CMN. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) 
was graded according to the criteria proposed by the 
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
(ISHLT) (Stewart et al., 2005), as follows: grade 1R, mild 
ACR; grade 2R, moderate ACR; and grade 3R, severe 
ACR, regardless of the presence or absence of CMN on 
slides. All the slides were examined by single pathologist.
Cytokine levels
Circulating levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ were quantified in 
mouse serum using the Bio-PlexⓇ Cytokine Assay 18-Plex 
kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and the Bio-Plex 
200 platform, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry analysis
Spleens were retrieved, mashed, and then erythrocytes 
were lysed using an RBC lysing buffer. Splenocytes were 
first stained extracellularly with anti-mouse CD3 APC, 
anti-mouse CD4 PE, anti-mouse CD8 PECy7, anti-mouse 
CD25 PECy7, anti-mouse CD45 APC, anti-mouse Ly6G 
PE, and appropriate isotype control mAb (BD Pharmingen, 
San Jose, CA), as per manufacturer's instructions. After 
surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 
Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Pharmingen), and 
then stained intracellularly with anti-mouse IL-17 FITC and 
anti-mouse Foxp3 APC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), 
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell analysis was 
performed using a FACScan cytometer equipped with 
CellQuest software (BD Bioscience).
Immunofluorescent staining and confocal analysis
For immunostaining, cardiac grafts were recovered at 
several time points after transplantation and embedded in 
OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan), 
and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (4 
μm) were fixed in acetone for 10 min and air-dried. Slides 
were stained with anti-mouse Ly6G Alexa 647 (BioLegend, 
San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD4 Pacific Blue, anti-mouse 
CD8 Alexa 488 (BD Pharmingen), and anti-mouse IL-17 
PE (eBioscience) for direct immunofluorescent staining, 
and then analyzed with a LSM 5 Image Browser using an 
LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope 
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Areas which showed the most 
extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells were selected 
and images were acquired at high-power (×400) using a 
confocal microscope. The CD4+
, CD8+
, Ly6G+
, and IL-17+
cells were counted in each image using ImageJ software 
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The per￾centages of IL-17+
 cells with respect to CD4+
, CD8+
, and 
Ly6G+
 cells were calculated using double immunofluo￾rescent data. A second 'blind' observer re-determined 
percentages using the same images. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 
version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS, IL). Data are presented 
as mean ± SEM and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney 
and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A P value ＜ 0.05 was considered 
to be statistically significant.
