Abstract
Background: Bronchiectasis is a progressive and fatal disease despite the available treatment regimens.
Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) may play an important role in the progression of bronchiectasis. However, active
anti-reflux intervention such as Stretta radiofrequency (SRF) and/or laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) have rarely
been used to treat Bronchiectasis.
Case Presentation: Seven patients’ clinical outcomes for treating GER-related deteriorated bronchiectasis were
retrospective reviewed. All patients were treated by SRF and/or LF, and had follow-up periods ranging from one to
five years. Typical GER symptoms, respiratory symptoms, medication consumption and general health status were
assessed during the follow-ups. At the latest follow-up all patients were alive. The typical GER symptoms
disappeared in five people and were significantly improved in the other two. Two had complete remissions of both
respiratory symptoms and bronchiectasis exacerbations; four had significantly improved respiratory symptoms to
mild/moderate degrees as well as reduced or zero bronchiectasis exacerbations, which allowed them to resume the
physical and social functions; one’s respiratory symptoms and bronchiectasis exacerbations were not much
improved, yet she was in stable condition and satisfied with the results.
Conclusions: Potentially, GER plays an important role in some patients with bronchiectasis, and active anti-reflux
treatments can be beneficial. Future clinical studies are suggested to clarify GER’s role in bronchiectasis and to
further determine whether anti-reflux interventions for GER can improve the outcomes of patients with
bronchiectasis.

Background
Bronchiectasis is defined as an irreversible dilatation of
the bronchial tree, representing the end stage of a num￾ber of different pulmonary pathology [1]. Bronchiectasis
is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory
infection, and causes chronic cough and copious produc￾tion of sputum, which is often purulent. The prevalence
of bronchiectasis in the United States ranges from
4.2 per 100,000 persons aged 18–34 years to 271.8 per
100,000 persons aged 75 years or older [2]. It occurs
more in elderly than in younger adults and more in wo￾men than in men. Bronchiectasis causes severe pulmonary
infections and deteriorates lung function. It can also be
associated with cystic fibrosis and other congenital pulmo￾nary disorders, foreign body inhalation, and other causes
of lung damage [3]. Frequent exacerbations are often asso￾ciated with infection and symptoms of increased dyspnea,
wheeze, and sputum production [4].
As the disease progresses, patients’ physical activities
become so increasingly limited that they fail to thrive,
thus ultimately suffer from social deprivation, intrinsic
depression, respiratory failure, chronic morbidity, and
even the possibility of premature mortality [5,6]. The
outcome of bronchiectasis has improved during the past
decades, but it still remains as an important cause of
death. The bronchiectasis related mortality seems to be
up to 13% over a 5-year follow-up period [7]. The treat￾ment of bronchiectasis is multimodality which includes
therapy with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents and

airway clearance, and requires pulmonary surgery and
even lung transplantation in a few selected patients [8].
GER which may be a possible etiology and risk factors
associated with bronchiectasis have not been well
addressed. Among patients with late stages of lung dis￾eases, the opportunity of treating GER is only shown in
a limited studies for chronic obstructive pulmonary dis￾ease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in even
fewer studies for bronchiectasis [9]. For the past 6 years
we have focused on treating GER related respiratory
symptoms [10,11], and our fundamental viewpoint is
that GER is an important risk factor for recurrent
microaspiration, which may cause airway irritation, lung
injury and respiratory tree remodeling [12]. Hereby, in
order to explore the importance of GER’s role in the
progression of bronchiectasis, we retrospectively re￾viewed a series of selected bronchiectasis patients whose
symptoms and physical functions were either stabilized
or improved after the anti-reflux interventions.
Patients and methods
In this series, patients were selected from Center for
GER, the Second Artillery General Hospital of Beijing
Normal University, China, from 2008 to 2012. The pa￾tients’ typical GER symptoms, respiratory symptoms,
medication consumption and general health status were
assessed before and after anti-reflux intervention. This
study was carried out with the approval of the Ethics
Committee of Second Artillery General Hospital.
Inclusion criteria
1. Bronchiectasis was diagnosed according to the pa￾tient’s longstanding respiratory symptoms, chest film and
computed tomography (CT) (Figure 1); 2. The presence of
GER were determined by various testing methods; 3. Pa￾tients were only partially responsive to medication therapy
for Bronchiectasis; 4. Patients received SRF and/or LF.
GER assessment and treatment
All the following tests were conducted to confirm the
presence of GER: 1. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH
probe monitoring, and a DeMeester score (DMS) > 14.72
was considered positive for increased acid GER [13]; 2.
Endoscopic evaluations for esophagitis and hiatus hernia
(HH); 3. High Resolution Manometry (HRM) for eluci￾dating the function of upper esophageal sphincter (UES)
and lower esophageal sphincter (LES).
The methods for how to carry out the SRF and the LF
were described in our previous studies [14,15].
Case presentation
One male and six female patients were included. Their
mean age was 49 years (ranging from 22 to 70 years).
The patients’ baseline pulmonary evaluation results are
summarized in Table 1. The results for patients’ GER
baseline evaluations, treatments and follow-ups are shown
in Table 2.
Case 1: The patient was a 48-year-old woman, whose
asthma was diagnosed at 8 months old. Twenty one
years ago she was diagnosed as bronchiectasis based on
a chest CT scan, and since then she had to be hospita￾lized several times every year for severe exacerbations.
Her symptoms were characterized as increased wheez￾ing, chest tightness, and productive cough with massive
brownish sputum which mainly occurred in the early
morning. Ten years ago she started to have symptomatic

GER and deteriorated exertional dyspnea. In August
2008 the patient received LF. Five years after the inter￾vention, the patient had no GER symptoms, her episodic
wheezing and chest tightness were reduced about 30%
without hospitalization, and her respiratory drug con￾sumption was cut by more than half. Although there
were fewer improvements in her cough and sputum pro￾ductions, the brownish sputum became occasional.
Case 2: Bronchiectasis was diagnosed in this 30-year￾old woman based on typical clinical features and CT
scan 7 years ago. Since she was born, the patient had
intermittent symptoms of severe cough, sputum produc￾tion as well as dyspnea mainly at night. Since then, she
had to be repeatedly hospitalized due to exacerbations
every year. She also developed mild GER symptoms, ac￾companied with daily respiratory symptoms and severe
dyspnea on exertion and fatigue in the later 5 years. In
September 2009 the patient underwent laparoscopic
repair of HH with LF. She became asymptomatic and
had resumed normal life without medication based on
her 4-year follow-up. Although the patient reported mild
cough and fatigue during her pregnancy in the later
6 months, she was still satisfied with our therapy.
Case 3: The patient was 70 years old. Her bronchiec￾tasis was diagnosed by a chest film 42 years ago after her
first episode of hemoptysis during sleep and was later
confirmed by a CT scan 15 years ago. There was no se￾vere cough or sputum production in her past history.
Her bronchiectasis was relatively stable and was mainly
represented as hemoptysis and slow progression of fa￾tigue. However, she complained much more about the
severe GER symptoms which was developed since her

childhood 60 years ago and worsened with reduced re￾sponse to anti-reflux medication. Four years ago, a HH
was confirmed by a barium swallow study. After evalu￾ation we performed a laparoscopic HH repair with LF
on the patient in October 2009. Without medication
both the GER symptoms and hemoptysis disappeared,
and the patient felt stable and more energetic at the
4-year follow-up.
Case 4: This was a 59-year-old woman who was diag￾nosed with asthma 20 years ago, and with bronchiectasis
based on CT scans 10 years ago. Her respiratory symp￾toms had been accompanied with persistent GER symp￾toms for 20 years and had worsened with exertional
dyspnea in the later 2 years. The respiratory symptoms
represented as episodic throat tightness, wheezing, short
of breath and productive cough. During the last 2 years,
repeated emergency treatments were required due to de￾teriorated exacerbations. In April 2011, the patient re￾ceived radiofrequency energy delivery to the LES, The
SRF procedure. At the 2-year follow-up, she was on the
daily dose of 20 mg Omeprazole. Her episodic throat
tightness and wheezing disappeared, and short of breath
and productive cough ameliorated more than half. Al￾though not fully recovered, she was satisfied with her
stable condition without hospitalization.
Case 5: The patient was a 59-year-old man who was
diagnosed with asthma 30 years ago and with bronchiec￾tasis based on chest film and CT scan 10 years ago. His
symptoms were characterized by increased wheezing,
chest tightness, productive cough which mainly occurred
at night and early morning. He had numerous emer￾gency visits due to severe exacerbations, in several of
which he had throat tightness, inability to breath, intense
stridor and syncope. The symptoms significantly wors￾ened in the later 3 years with exertional dyspnea and in￾capable of less than 100 meter walk. For 4 years he also
experienced symptomatic GER. In November 2011, the
patient received SRF treatment. At the 2-year follow-up
after the intervention, the patient had no GER symptoms
and only mild productive cough without exacerbation
and medication. His normal daily activity was resumed
and was capable of housework and nonstop walking for
two kilometers.
Case 6: The patient was 58 years old and was diag￾nosed with asthma 25 years ago and with bronchiectasis
based on CT scan 4 years ago. The respiratory symptoms
had lasted for 30 years and had worsened with disabling
exertional dyspnea accompanied with GER symptoms
for the later 10 years. Her symptoms presented as epi￾sodic throat tightness, wheezing, short of breath and
productive cough. During the later 10 years she had
daily symptoms and numerous emergency treatments
for exacerbations. In September 2011 she underwent
laparoscopic repair of the HH with LF. Afterwards, the
patient’s GER symptoms became occasional, the episodic
throat tightness and wheezing disappeared, and exer￾tional dyspnea was markedly improved, yet her cough
remained unchanged and had become bothersome for
6 months until she had an exacerbations and tempera￾ture reached 39.0°C. The patient was readmitted to our
hospital. In March 2012, per her insistent request we
performed SRF therapy when she was stabilized after a
14-day course of antibiotics. To our surprise, her cough
was cleared and exertional dyspnea was further im￾proved after SRF therapy. She resumed relatively normal
daily activity as a housewife and was stable without me￾dication afterwards.
Case 7: This was a 22-year-old junior college student,
whose asthma was diagnosed since she was born and
bronchiectasis was diagnosed based on a chest CT at ad￾mission. Her symptoms were characterized by heavy
wheezing, chest tightness, productive cough of massive
white foamy sputum which mainly occurred at night.
For 15 years, she had symptomatic GER and worsening
exertional dyspneas. She had received 4 emergency treat￾ments for exacerbations, and in one of them she lost her
consciousness. In May 2012, after we gave her a LF, her
episodic productive cough and wheezing disappeared
without medication, the exertional dyspnea was markedly
improved, and she obtained a normalized college life.
Discussion
The clinical course of bronchiectasis is generally punc￾tuated by infectious exacerbations, and the clinical pre￾sentation of bronchiectasis may be complicated by the
coexistence of other medical conditions or comorbidi￾ties, including GER [16,17]. The role of GER in the
pathogenesis of miscellaneous respiratory symptoms and
diseases has been discussed for decades and it is com￾mon understanding on its close association in asthma
and cough. There is a high prevalence of reflux in
asthmatics and chronic cough, which may be induced
through different mechanisms including microaspiration
and both local and central reflexes [18]. Symptomatic
and clinically silent reflux has been detected in bronchi￾ectasis, with the prevalence from 26% to 75%, and aspir￾ation of gastric contents in the respiratory tree is not
rare in patients with GER [19,20]. In a group of patients
with advanced lung disease including bronchiectasis
manometry showed that 57% of patients had LES hypo￾tonia and 14% had UES hypotonia [21]. Similar results
were found in the seven patients of our study. Four pa￾tients had evident GER symptoms and the other three
only had occasional GER symptoms. Four patients had
abnormal acid reflux detected by 24 hour esophageal pH
monitoring and five patients had esophagitis. In ad￾dition, two patients were detected with LES hypotonia
and two with UES hypotonia (Table 2). GER may have

influence on respiratory symptoms or bronchiectasis with
similar mechanisms, reflex bronchoconstriction, and pul￾monary microaspiration [9,22]. The frequency and dur￾ation of episodes, as well as the volume, composition, and
destination of GER are all factors in determining its sig￾nificance [12]. With aspiration into the tracheobronchial
tree, GER is hypothesized to present as insidious-onset
bronchiectasis, which induces erosion via reflux contents
thus triggering chronic airway inflammation and remo￾deling [23].
Increased GER is principally caused by gastroesopha￾geal junction incompetence and may arise from LES
hypotension, including transient relaxations, HH, and
esophageal dysmotility [24]. Current GER therapy fo￾cuses on modifying risk factors, inhibiting the produc￾tion of gastric acid, enhancing esophageal and gastric
motility, and modifying gastroesophageal junction. In
GER treatments, both proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and
LF are highly successful in relieving esophagus symp￾toms [25]. However, recent meta-analysis found no sig￾nificant difference between placebo and PPI in resolving
GER related cough and asthma [26]. The possible reason
could be that anti-acid treatment provides fast symptom
relief on GER, but does not sufficiently prevent aspi￾ration. Moreover, the relapses could be as high as 70%
within 6 months after the medication is stopped [27]. As
presented in this case series, SRF or LF restores anatom￾ical anti-reflux barriers and reduces GER symptoms and
possibly prevents the related aspiration, thus can serve
as a better therapeutic means for bronchiectasis. The
anti-reflux surgeries reported encouraging results in
asthmatic patients selected on the basis of esophageal
pH monitoring [28], and are well demonstrated in our
previous LF and SRF studies [14,15,29-31]. Yet, the ef￾fects are unknown on modifying risk factors and acid in￾hibit therapy in bronchiectasis patients. LF has been
performed for GER in end-stage lung diseases mainly in￾cluding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and
COPD before or after lung transplantation, and is bene￾ficial for lung functions, allograft and quality of life in
the selected patients [32-35]. A report by Davis et al.
showed that within a group of patents with lung trans￾plantations, fundoplication in two patients with ad￾vanced bronchiectasis had resulted in lung function
improvements and reduction in oxygen requirements
[36]. In our study, LF was carried out in four patients,
SRF was performed in two patients, and only one patient
received both SRF and LF. The patients selected in our
study were not in end-stage bronchiectasis requiring
lung transplantation. After anti-reflux interventions, one
patient was under daily dose of 20 mg Omeprazole for
GER and six patients did not need PPI, while acid reflux
was normalized in all the patients. Respiratory symp￾toms, physical and social functions were significantly im￾proved in six patients and partially improved in one.
Based on our experience, active anti-reflux intervention
such as LF or SRF could be considered in the setting of
GER related respiratory symptoms or diseases in various
stages including the end-stage, as to achieve more pre￾cise, long-lasting and stable therapeutic effects. Especially,
Figure 2 In case 6, a sliding hernia was identified under endoscopy (A), which was considered as the cause of the patient’s GER and
then the asthmatic symptoms. This anatomical defect was then corrected by laparoscopic repair of the HH with LF (B). Although her
respiratory symptoms was significantly relieved, the remaining cough was still evident, an additional anti-reflux SRF was conducted (C & D), which
finally cleared her cough.
Hu et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2013, 13:34 Page 5 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2466/13/34

when HH is involved, laparoscopic surgery could be con￾sidered as the most effective means for GER.
Specific pathophysiological features which are charac￾teristic of respiratory diseases such as chronic cough and
asthma may accompany with bronchiectasis, to make it
a more complicated disease. The prevalence of bronchi￾ectasis among asthma patients was 1.8% and asthma in
bronchiectasis patients was 19.0% [37]. Asthma patients
who had coexisting bronchiectasis had significantly more
hospitalizations due to severe asthma exacerbations and
Figure 3 24-h Dual-channel esophageal pH monitoring graphs shows the pH monitor line featuring the pH fluctuation in
esophagus, <pH 4.0 indicating of acid reflux. A: In case 7, the distal and proximal esophagus (CH1 and CH2) had synchronic pathologic
acid reflux (DeMeester score: 60.0). B: In case 1, the pH line rarely declined below pH 4.0 (DeMeester score: 3.04). However her basal
esophagus pH was >7, if a threshold of < pH 5 or < pH 6 (weak acid) is applied the patient should be considered to have abnormal
synchronic distal and proximal reflux [42].
Hu et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2013, 13:34 Page 6 of 9

presence of chronic respiratory failures [38]. As found in
our study, five of the seven patients had also been re￾peatedly diagnosed as asthma in other hospitals and
required frequent hospitalizations. One hypothesis to ex￾plain the prevalence of bronchiectasis in asthma patients
is that the hyperresponsive bronchi are destroyed by in￾flammatory process or recurrent infection. However,
when GER is involved, both asthma and bronchiectasis
may be the same consequence of GER, and in this term,
GER, asthma and bronchiectasis can be considered as
the same entity [10]. The longstanding respiratory di￾seases related to GER had negative impacts on lung
functions of the seven patients. As shown in Table 1,
all patients’ lung functions had declined to the COPD
level (FEV1/FVC < 70%), with four of them in severe
stages (FEV1 30%–49%) and one in very severe stage
(FEV1 < 30%) (Table 1). Thus early evaluation and effect￾ive control of bronchiectasis related GER may result in
more benefits for the bronchiectasis patients. As none of
the patients reexamined spirometry in this series, whe￾ther anti-reflux intervention improves the patient’s pul￾monary function is indicated in further studies.
GER can be assessed in a number of ways. Endoscopy
provides evidence of esophagitis and HH [39], and the
presence of HH is an important indication for laparo￾scopic treatment in our practice (Figure 2). 24-h Dual￾channel esophageal pH monitoring, the standard test for
GER, may demonstrate abnormal esophageal acid expo￾sure in the absence of esophageal damage (i.e. non-erosive
disease), and demonstrates the pH fluctuation at the distal
and proximal esophagus (Figure 3). Yet the development
of esophageal impedance monitoring now allows the
assessment of all reflux events (regardless of degrees of
acidity) and further classification of reflux by the proximal
extension, e.g. to the upper esophagus or even pharynx
[40]. In addition, HRM demonstrates esophageal dyski￾nesia or hypotonia of the UES and LES (Figure 4), thus it
elucidates the possible esophagus dysfunction involved in
GER [41]. In our opinion, for patients with active bronchi￾ectasis and/or asthma, a complete GER evaluation should
be recommended, especially when they have evident GER
symptoms, which may have important diagnostic and the￾rapeutic importance for the patients.
Conclusion
The limitations in the retrospective observations made
in this case series are inevitable. However, given the lack
of effective treatments for bronchiectasis and the en￾couraging results in these patients whose conditions
may have otherwise deteriorated during the follow-up
years, this study could be informative and provocative. A
complete evaluation on bronchiectasis patients for treat￾ments of the underlying causes such as GER may im￾prove symptoms and prevent disease from progression.
Further larger studies are needed for the following: (1)
Determining the clinical significance of aspiration in
bronchiectasis patients and the responses to anti-reflux
treatments; (2) Finding out better diagnostic tests to
Figure 4 High-resolution color contour of HRM. In case 5, the body and LES of the esophagus function normally. However the UES resting
pressure is in hypotension. The UES and LES are allies of the anti-reflux barrier either dysfunction of them can lead to trans-UES reflux which may
cause microaspiration.

treated by anti-reflux interventions; (3) To understand
