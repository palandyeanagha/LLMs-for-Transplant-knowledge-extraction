Abstract
Background: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) causes physiological, metabolic,
end-organ and inflammatory changes that need to be addressed for better management of severely injured
patients. The aim of this study was to investigate occlusion time-dependent metabolic, end-organ and
inflammatory effects of total REBOA in Zone I in a normovolemic animal model.
Methods: Twenty-four pigs (25-35 kg) were randomized to total occlusion REBOA in Zone I for either 15, 30, 60 min
(REBOA15, REBOA30, and REBOA60, respectively) or to a control group, followed by 3-h reperfusion. Hemodynamic
variables, metabolic and inflammatory response, intraperitoneal and intrahepatic microdialysis, and plasma markers
of end-organ injuries were measured during intervention and reperfusion. Intestinal histopathology was performed.
Results: Mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increased significantly in all REBOA groups during occlusion and
blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery and urinary production subsided during intervention. Metabolic
acidosis with increased intraperitoneal and intrahepatic concentrations of lactate and glycerol was most
pronounced in REBOA30 and REBOA60 during reperfusion and did not normalize at the end of reperfusion in
REBOA60. Inflammatory response showed a significant and persistent increase of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines during reperfusion in REBOA30 and was most pronounced in REBOA60. Plasma concentrations of liver,
kidney, pancreatic and skeletal muscle enzymes were significantly increased at the end of reperfusion in REBOA30
and REBOA60. Significant intestinal mucosal damage was present in REBOA30 and REBOA60.
Conclusion: Total REBOA caused severe systemic and intra-abdominal metabolic disturbances, organ damage and
inflammatory activation already at 30 min of occlusion.

Background
Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta
(REBOA) is an aortic occlusive method using endovas￾cular principles for temporary bleeding control and for
increasing perfusion pressure in coronary and cerebral
arteries in trauma patients until definitive surgical repair
is performed [1–9]. The inflammatory response to aortic
occlusion is believed to cause multiple organ failure and
late mortality secondary to ischemia reperfusion injuries
(IRI) [1, 10–13]. Ischemia causes anaerobic metabolism
and impaired cellular membrane function leading to cel￾lular swelling. Reperfusion upregulates the production of
oxygen free radicals causing complement system activa￾tion and synthesis of endothelial adhesion molecules. IRI
is a result of an inflammatory cascade mediated by hor￾mones, proteins and mediators such as interleukine-1
(IL-1), IL-6 and TNF-alfa [10, 11, 14]. It has been sug￾gested that the tissues suffering most from IRI are the

kidneys, gastro-intestinal tract and the lower extremities,
with virtually all organs being susceptible to the conse￾quences of IRI in aortic occlusion [1, 10]. However,
multi-trauma patients are exposed to varying degrees of
hypoperfusion and reperfusion, thus complicating the
evaluation of the inflammatory response that might be
expected from aortic occlusion per se [11, 15, 16]. To
date, multiple clinical studies and translational
hemorrhagic models have been conducted describing
the effects of REBOA in a state of hemorrhagic shock,
but few studies have been performed that capture the ef￾fects of REBOA in a non-shock condition and give a de￾tailed description of the changes occurring at as early as
15 min and up to 60 min of occlusion [7, 8, 17–21].
Ischemia reperfusion injuries probably occur as a grad￾ual response to aortic occlusion. Even shorter occlusion
times than those suggested in previous studies could in￾duce alterations such as endothelial dysfunction, inflam￾matory activation and organ injury [15, 16, 22]. We
hypothesized that significant metabolic and inflamma￾tory response and tissue damage begin already after 15–
30 min of total thoracic (Zone I) REBOA. The aim of
this study was to investigate potential gradual changes in
response to occlusion time on systemic and intra￾abdominal metabolic, inflammatory and organ damage
variables with Zone I total REBOA in a non-shock por￾cine model.
Methods
Animals
The study was approved by the Linköping Animal Ethics
Committee (Linköping, Sweden, ID 105/10) and con￾ducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Euro￾pean Union for the protection of animals used for
scientific purposes [23]. The study was undertaken dur￾ing November 2014 at a research laboratory at the
Örebro University Hospital, Örebro, Sweden. Twenty￾five pigs (a crossbreed between Swedish country breed,
Hampshire and Yorkshire; 3–4 months old; weight range
25–35 kg) of both sexes were used for the experiment.
Consent to participate was obtained from the farmer.
The animals had free access to food and water before
experimentation.
The dataset used in this article are available from the
corresponding author on request.
Anesthesia
Premedication, general anesthesia, ventilation, antibiotic
prophylaxis and euthanization at the end of the experi￾ment were recently described [21]. However, one differ￾ence was that intravenous bolus doses of pethidine (25–
50 mg h− 1
) were used in this study instead of fentanyl
infusion. In brief, the animals were premedicated with
azaperone (intramuscular injection) at the farm and
transported to the laboratory. General anesthesia was in￾duced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of aza￾perone, tiletamine and zolazepam, and maintained by
continuous intravenous infusion of propofol and intermit￾tent intravenous boluses of pethidine (25–50 mg h− 1
).
Cefuroxime and atropine were also administered intraven￾ously and intramuscularly, respectively. After endotracheal
intubation, the animals were mechanically normoventi￾lated with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.
Fluid loss was substituted with continuous intravenous in￾fusions of Ringer’s acetate and glucose solutions. Body
temperature was kept between 37 and 39 °C using forced￾air warming blankets. At the end of the experiments, the
animals were euthanized with fast intravenous injections
of propofol (200 mg, as an overdose of anesthetics) and
potassium chloride (40 mmol, to induce cardiac arrest),
and ECG confirmed asystole.
Surgical preparation
The basic surgical preparation and measurements have
been recently described in detail [21]. In short, a pul￾monary arterial catheter was used for measurements of
cardiac output (CO), pulmonary wedge pressure and
central venous pressure, and for sampling of mixed ven￾ous blood. The common carotid artery catheter was used
to measure systemic blood pressure and heart rate (HR),
and for arterial blood sampling above the occlusion bal￾loon. The right common femoral artery (CFA) was surgi￾cally exposed and used for REBOA introduction and
arterial blood sampling below the balloon. The left CFA
and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were dissected,
and transonic flow measurement probes were placed
around them to measure distal blood flow. A catheter
was placed in the superior mesentery vein for measure￾ment of mesenteric venous pressure and for blood sam￾pling. A urinary catheter was placed in the urinary
bladder for measuring urinary output and taking urine
samples. Microdialysis (mDialysis M62, Sweden) cathe￾ters (M70 catheter) were placed intraperitoneally, in the
left lower side of the abdomen, and intrahepatically for
analysis of extracellular concentrations of glucose, gly￾cerol, lactate and pyruvate.
Experimental protocol
Before intervention, the animals were each randomized,
using envelopes, into one of four groups: 15 min REBOA
(REBOA15), 30 min REBOA (REBOA30), 60 min
REBOA (REBOA60) in the thoracic descending aorta
(Zone I) and a control group (no REBOA, C). The
REBOA catheter (Rescue Balloon, 7 Fr, Tokai Medical
Products Inc., Kasugai, Japan) was retrogradely advanced
with fluoroscopic guidance. After the occlusion, the bal￾loon was slowly deflated over a period of 2 min but not
removed. The animals were observed for 3 h after the

intervention and hemodynamic variables, blood gases,
serum for inflammatory markers, and end organ meta￾bolic enzymes via arterial blood samples were examined.
During reperfusion, the animals received only crystalloid
fluids, and no vasopressors or inotropic drugs were used.
So as not to interfere with the physiological response,
the same amount of fluid was given to all groups.
Temperature, urinary output and blood gas analysis
from the carotid artery and mesenteric vein were moni￾tored. Intraperitoneal and intrahepatic metabolism was
measured using microdialysis catheters, including analysis
of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and lactate-pyruvate ratio,
and also glycerol as a marker of cellular damage [21]. The
inflammatory response was measured by collecting arterial
carotid blood in test tubes, allowing coagulation for 30
min followed by centrifugation to achieve serum. The
serum was then stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Cytokine
detection in serum was performed as previously described
[21]. Tissue samples from the small bowel (2 cm × 2 cm)
were taken, placed in formalin solution and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin stain [21]. The pathologist was
blind to the randomization of the animals, and analysis of
the severity of the histological changes was assessed using
a six-grade system with grade 0 representing normal tissue
and grade 5 necrosis [24, 25].
Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS version 23 was used for statistical analysis.
Data are presented as mean and 95% confidence interval.
For analysis of variance, a linear mixed model analysis
was performed where the repeated factor was time and
the other factor was group. If values were significant,
post-hoc multiple comparisons were performed using
Bonferroni correction. Normal distribution was investi￾gated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. For non-normal distri￾bution, log10 transformation was used, mainly for
inflammatory markers. Statistical significance was con￾sidered at p < 0.05.
Results
One animal in the REBOA60 group died after deflation of
REBOA, probably due to hemodynamic instability, and
was replaced. Twenty-four animals completed the experi￾ment with six animals in each group. No significant differ￾ences were observed at baseline between the groups.
Hemodynamic and respiratory variables
Aortic occlusion in all REBOA groups induced immedi￾ate systemic hypertension, tachycardia and increased CO
(Table 1, Fig. 1). These effects gradually subsided
throughout the occlusion period in all REBOA groups,
with these changes being correspondingly more pro￾nounced in REBOA60 than in REBOA15 at the end of
the occlusion period (Table 1, Fig. 1). During aortic
occlusion, the blood flows in SMA and CFA ceased
completely in all REBOA groups (Table 1). At reperfu￾sion, the systemic arterial blood pressure decreased in all
REBOA groups, however to a lower level in REBOA60
compared to REBOA15 and REBOA30 (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Heart rate and CO returned towards control group
values during the reperfusion period, but were non￾significantly higher and lower, respectively, in REBOA60
compared to REBOA15 and REBOA30 (Table 1). Blood
flow in SMA and CFA increased towards baseline values
during the reperfusion period, however less in REBOA60
(Table 1). The central hemodynamic and blood flow var￾iables were maintained in the control group (Fig. 1,
Table 1). Minute ventilation and fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) were similar in all groups and constant
over time (data not shown). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was
unchanged and similar in all groups (Table 1). In all
REBOA groups, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) was
significantly reduced during aortic occlusion but normal￾ized during reperfusion (Table 1).
Systemic acid-base status and potassium
At the end of aortic occlusion, arterial pH was un￾changed in REBOA15 and REBOA30 compared to
controls but was significantly lower in REBOA60
(Fig. 2). Arterial lactate concentrations were signifi￾cantly different between all REBOA groups, with the
most pronounced increase in REBOA60 and arterial
potassium concentrations were significantly higher in
REBOA60 compared to control at the end of aortic
occlusion (Fig. 2). During early reperfusion, arterial
pH decreased and arterial lactate concentrations in￾creased in all REBOA groups, and the magnitude of
these changes was dependent on duration of aortic
occlusion (Fig. 2). During the reperfusion period, ar￾terial pH and lactate concentrations slowly returned
to baseline values, however they were only normalized
in REBOA15 (Fig. 2). Arterial potassium concentra￾tions increased steadily throughout the reperfusion
period in REBOA60, and were significantly higher at
the end of reperfusion compared to the other REBOA
groups (Fig. 2).
Intra-abdominal metabolism
Mesenteric oxygen uptake was significantly reduced dur￾ing occlusion in all groups but normalized during reper￾fusion (Table 1). Mesenteric venous pH was reduced,
and mesenteric venous lactate and potassium concentra￾tions were increased during occlusion in all REBOA
groups; these changes were most pronounced in
REBOA60. These returned towards normal during re￾perfusion in all groups but did not completely recover in
REBOA30 and REBOA60 (Fig. 2).

Intraperitoneal and intrahepatic concentrations of lac￾tate increased during aortic occlusion, peaked at 1 h of re￾perfusion and only returned to baseline values at the end
of the experiment in REBOA15 (Fig. 3). The concentration
of lactate was mostly increased in REBOA60 and was
higher intrahepatically than intraperitoneally. The intra￾peritoneal lactate-pyruvate ratio was increased during aor￾tic occlusion in REBOA30 (27 [− 1.5–56) and REBOA60
(26 [18–34]) compared to controls (16 [9–23]), but
returned towards normal. The intrahepatic lactate￾pyruvate ratio as mentioned increased more than intraper￾itoneal in REBOA30 (46 [− 56–147]) and REBOA60 (116
[− 115–346]) compared to controls (31 [10–52]) The in￾traperitoneal and intrahepatic concentrations of glucose
were unchanged during aortic occlusion in all REBOA
groups and increased during reperfusion, reaching the
highest levels at 1 h of reperfusion and being most pro￾nounced in REBOA60 in the intrahepatic compartment.
At the end of reperfusion, the concentrations returned to
baseline values in all REBOA groups (Fig. 3).
Visceral organs
At the end of reperfusion, plasma creatinine, aspartate
aminotransferase and lipase concentrations were signifi￾cantly increased in REBOA30 and REBOA60, but not in
REBOA15, compared to controls (Table 2). The plasma
alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase concentra￾tions increased most, and significantly in REBOA60 dur￾ing reperfusion compared to the other groups (Table 2).
Urinary output decreased to zero in all REBOA groups
during occlusion (Table 1). The intraperitoneal concen￾trations of glycerol, a marker of cell membrane damage,
started to increase during occlusion in all REBOA
groups and increased significantly throughout reperfu￾sion, being most pronounced in REBOA60 (Fig. 3).
Intrahepatic concentrations of glycerol were only in￾creased during early reperfusion in REBOA60 (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The present study investigated the hemodynamic, meta￾bolic, end-organ and inflammatory effects of REBOA in
relation to duration of aortic occlusion in a non￾hemorrhagic animal model. The findings regarding the
hemodynamic response are consistent with previous
studies on thoraco-abdominal aortic clamping [26, 27],
but with further and more profound examination of the
alterations in metabolic and inflammatory responses in
various organs during aortic occlusion and reperfusion.

Aortic occlusion caused an immediate increase in sys￾temic arterial blood pressure, which increased by 100%
within 5 min of occlusion (not shown in the figures).
The observed hemodynamic response is presumably due
to different mechanisms of action, such as secretion of
catecholamines and renin-angiotensin, blood volume re￾distribution with absorption of intestinal fluid into the
circulation, and venous capacity reduction inducing
central hypervolemia. However, systemic blood pressure
slowly decreased over time in all REBOA groups starting
as early as within 15 min of aortic occlusion. This
phenomenon could be explained by reduced return of
blood from the splanchnic vasculature, and perhaps over
activation of autonomic and hormonal signaling systems,
thus suggesting that the desired effect of the aortic bal￾loon occlusion might eventually diminish with longer
occlusion times [26, 27]. Ischemia and reperfusion cause
reactive hyperemia mediated by the inflammatory re￾sponse leading to pooling of the blood in the distal parts
of the body whereby systemic hypovolemia arises [1],
which was most pronounced in REBOA60. This study
found no evidence for respiratory failure with increased
pulmonary vascular resistance and edema as previously
described, i.e. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was not affected [1, 14].
Reduced organ perfusion leads to cellular anaerobic me￾tabolism, which was evident with significantly increased
concentrations of lactate in the mesenteric vein during
aortic occlusion, reaching maximum levels in arterial
blood during early reperfusion as the ischemic blood
returns to the circulation. Arterial and mesenteric venous
lactate concentrations increased in all REBOA groups, but
mostly in REBOA30 and REBOA60, and did not return to
baseline values during the 3 h of reperfusion. Intrahepatic
lactate concentration increased two-fold compared with
intraperitoneal concentration during early reperfusion,
possibly due to the gluconeogenesis process in the liver
where lactate is metabolized to produce glucose. Similar
results were shown with glycerol concentrations. The an￾aerobic metabolites peaked during early reperfusion and
normalized within 3 h of reperfusion in REBOA15, but
not in REBOA30 or REBOA60 probably due to greater is￾chemic insult. During early reperfusion, the concentra￾tions of intraperitoneal and intrahepatic glucose increased
in REBOA30 and REBOA60. The increased glucose could
be attributed to sympatho-adrenal discharge leading to
glycogenolysis, but possibly also to reduced perfusion of
the pancreas diminishing insulin release [1].
The inflammatory response associated with multiple
organ failure in trauma patients was studied by Svoboda
et al. who suggested a correlation between IL-6 levels
and injury severity and the development of multiple
organ failure [12]. Another study by Wallinder et al. de￾scribing early inflammatory response in patients with
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) showed
significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in patients
with rAAA compared to non-ruptured AAA [28]. Simi￾lar findings have been described in experimental
hemorrhagic animal models using supraceliac aortic oc￾clusion for 30 to 90 min, with the increase of IL-6,
IL1beta, TNF-alfa and IL10 suggesting a correlation be￾tween aortic occlusion time, the magnitude of the in￾flammatory response, and organ failure [11, 14]. The

inflammatory response in this study caused by aortic oc￾clusion and reperfusion was observed at as early as 1 h
of reperfusion, with a significant increase of IL-6 in
REBOA60 and REBOA30 compared to controls. At 1 h
of reperfusion, both pro- and anti-inflammatory cyto￾kines increased in REBOA 30 and 60 as a response to
aortic occlusion, which became significant by the end of
the experiment. The denominator for all these studies is
organ hypoperfusion, which activates the inflammatory
cascade and is most profound when using an aortic oc￾clusive device such as REBOA. This has to be taken into
consideration during resuscitation after REBOA use.
Ischemia-reperfusion injuries to visceral organs were
demonstrated with increases in liver- and pancreatic en￾zymes, reduced kidney filtration and muscle damage
throughout reperfusion, with significantly higher enzyme
concentrations in REBOA60 but also seen in REBOA30.
Significant histological mucosal ischemic injuries were
already present in REBOA30.
IRI also caused hyperkalemia in all groups through
acidosis and reduced excretion in the kidneys, and re￾duced insulin levels due to diminished perfusion of the
pancreas [1]. This could be a lethal consequence of the
ischemia and reperfusion leading to cardiac arrhythmia
and death. Interestingly, potassium reached maximum
levels during late reperfusion in all groups, being most
pronounced in REBOA60, which is a sign of serious
organ injury. These findings suggest that organ injury
probably begins earlier than previously explained and
even 30 min of occlusion causes ischemic insult [29]. To
determine a safe aortic occlusion time is probably im￾possible due to the multiple insults a severely trauma￾tized patient suffers, but the knowledge that only 30 min
of aortic occlusion may initiate severe metabolic de￾rangements, end-organ injury and a significant inflam￾matory response is important. The use of techniques to
limit ischemic insults of aortic occlusion, such as the use
of partial REBOA, is therefore warranted when possible
[30–33]. Future studies from the team will focus on de￾velopment of partial occlusion technique.
There are some limitations to our experimental model.
The short reperfusion time does not allow investigation
of irreversible organ damage. However the trends in the
immediate post-occlusion period indicates severe

metabolic and inflammatory consequences of REBOA
use. Another limitation of this study is that it is a non￾hemorrhagic model and excludes the metabolic and in￾flammatory impact of traumatic injury, however the aim
of the study was to investigate the consequences of aor￾tic occlusion per se.
Conclusion
Total REBOA caused severe systemic and intra￾abdominal metabolic disturbances and organ damage as
well as inflammatory activation already at 30 min of oc￾clusion in a non-hemorrhagic porcine model. Safe aortic
occlusion time needs to be re-evaluated. The use of
techniques to limit the ischemic insult by REBOA is
demanded, even if a relatively short occlusion time is
expected.
