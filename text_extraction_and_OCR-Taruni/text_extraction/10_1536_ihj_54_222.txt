Summary
The long-term survival of heart transplantation (HTx) recipients has increased significantly in recent years, howev￾er, the nephrotoxic adverse effects of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are still a major concern. Recently, an inhibitor of 
mammalian target of rapamycin, everolimus (EVL), has emerged as an alternative immunosuppressant drug that may al￾low CNI dosage reduction and thereby spare renal function. Data were collected from 20 HTx recipients who had re￾ceived EVL (target trough level 3-8 ng/mL) along with a dose reduction of CNIs and/or mycophenolate mophetil (MMF) 
and had been followed for 1 year. Estimated glomerular filtration rate increased significantly with a reduction in the CNI 
dosage in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001, r = -0.807). Neutrophil count increased significantly (P < 0.05) with a 
reduction in the dosage of MMF (P = 0.009, r = -0.671). Cytomegalovirus antigenemia remained negative after EVL ad￾ministration among all candidates without any antiviral agents (P = 0.001). There were no significant increases in the 
acute rejection rates among recipients with EVL compared to those without EVL (P = 0.132). An immunosuppressant 
strategy incorporating EVL could reduce the CNI and MMF dosages, which resulted in improvements in renal dysfunc￾tion and neutropenia while maintaining low rejection rates among HTx recipients. (Int Heart J 2013; 54: 222-227)

Heart transplantation (HTx) is still the only complete 
solution for stage D heart failure 1,2) owing to not only 
recent improvements in surgical procedures but also 
to newly developed immunosuppressant therapy. As one of the 
essential immunosuppressant drugs, calcineurin inhibitors 
(CNIs) have been widely used after HTx for 30 years around 
the world.3) There is no doubt that this revolutionary class of 
drugs led to the current marked improvement in survival rates, 
however, the adverse effects of CNI therapy, especially the 
worsening of renal function, remain a concern.4) The inosine 
monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolate mo￾phetil (MMF) has become one of the standard immunosup￾pressant regimens for HTx maintenance therapy,5) however, 
MMF is often associated with serious neutropenia.6) Therefore, 
a remaining major challenge is to develop immunosuppressive 
strategies that allow CNI/MMF minimization or elimination in 
order to reduce adverse events while maintaining low acute re￾jection rates.
Recently, a new immunosuppressive drug, everolimus 
(EVL), which is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamy￾cin, has been approved for HTx recipients in Europe and Ja￾pan.7) EVL binds to the tacrolimus-binding protein and creates 
an active moiety that blocks the mammalian target of rapamy￾cin and then arrests the cell cycle of lymphocytes in the G1 
phase.8) EVL exerts immunosuppressive effects by inhibition 
of interleukin-2-mediated lymphocyte proliferation.8) Recent 
studies have suggested that the administration of EVL along 
with reduction or elimination of CNIs could spare renal func￾tion in heart or kidney transplantation recipients.9-18) However, 
to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the dos￾age of a standard immunosuppressant drug and the above￾mentioned adverse effects has not yet been fully analyzed, es￾pecially in Japanese patients. In the present study, we analyzed 
the dose-dependent adverse effects of EVL, CNIs, and MMF.

No 4 EVEROLIMUS WITH REDUCED CNI
Methods
Patient population: The study patients included 25 consecu￾tive recipients who had undergone HTx at the University of 
Tokyo Hospital and 11 consecutive patients who received a 
HTx in a foreign country. They were followed at the University 
of Tokyo Hospital between June 2006 and December 2012. 
EVL was administered to 22 (61.1%) patients. Two patients 
were excluded because of insufficient data. The final patient 
population was 20 patients. All patients were followed for at 
least 1 month, and 14 patients for 1 year. The institutional pro￾tocol for the monitoring of rejection with serial endomyocar￾dial biopsy and hemodynamic measurements routinely began 
7 days after transplantation and were then performed weekly 
in the first month, every other week until 3 months, monthly 
until 6 months, and then once a year thereafter. When rejection 
was suspected, these examinations were performed on an 
emergency basis. Written informed consent was obtained from 
all patients and/or family members before a HTx. The study 
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Gradu￾ate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo [application 
number 779 (1)].
Immunosuppressant strategy: After HTx, all recipients were 
treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen consisting 
of a CNI [cyclosporine (CyA) or tacrolimus (TAC)], MMF, 
and low dose prednisolone. The trough concentration of CyA 
was maintained at 300-400 ng/mL until 3 months, 250-300 ng/
mL until 6 months, 200-250 ng/mL until 1 year, and 150-200 
ng/mL after 1 year. The trough concentration of TAC was 
maintained at 10-15 ng/mL until 3 months after HTx, around 
10 ng/mL until 1 year, and 5-8 ng/mL after 1 year. MMF was 
administered at a dose of 1500-2000 mg daily during the study 
period unless an adverse effect occurred. Prednisolone was ad￾ministered at 1 mg/kg daily at first, and then tapered off gradu￾ally until 1 year after HTx if possible.
The timing of the introduction of EVL was determined 
by the attending physician based on the following criteria: (1) 
Conversion from MMF to EVL because of neutropenia or di￾gestive symptoms such as repeated diarrhea. (2) Administra￾tion of EVL with reduction of CNI because of deteriorating re￾nal function (a continuous rise in serum creatinine level over 
1.5 mg/dL). In this case, the target CNI trough concentration 
was reduced by approximately 30%. (3) Add-on treatment of 
EVL because of progressive cardiac allograft vasculopathy 
(progression of maximal intimal thickness > 1.5 mm/year on 
intravascular ultrasound) or frequent acute cellular rejection 
(ISHLT grade ≥ 2R). All introductions of EVL except for one 
case were initiated in-hospital and the recipients were carefully 
monitored until the trough concentration of the immunosup￾pressant had stabilized. All patients achieved the target EVL 
trough concentration range (3-8 ng/mL) throughout most of 
the study period.19)
Variables evaluated: At baseline (ie, at the time of EVL intro￾duction) and 1 month and 1 year after the administration of 
EVL, a physical examination was performed, laboratory data 
were assayed, and the trough concentrations of CNIs and EVL 
were monitored. At each routine admission or unexpected ad￾mission due to suspected rejection, hemodynamic study and 
endomyocardial biopsy were performed. Seventeen recipients 
who did not receive EVL were also analyzed as a control 
group.
Statistical analysis: All statistical analyses were performed us￾ing statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Results 
are presented as the mean ± standard deviation unless other￾wise specified. Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic 
parameters at 1 month and 1 year after the administration of 
EVL were compared with those of baseline using Dunnett’s 
post hoc test. Correlations were determined using Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient.
Results
Patient baseline characteristics (Table): The study population 
included 15 males (75.0%) with a mean age of 41.6 ± 13.1 
years (range, 12-63 years-old). A total of 20 recipients were 
enrolled and followed for 1 month and 14 of these 20 were fol￾lowed for 1 year after the administration of EVL. No patient 
discontinued EVL during the study period. Eight patients 
(40.0%) had received CyA, and its trough concentration was 
reduced significantly after the administration of EVL (P < 
0.05). Twelve patients (60.0%) had received TAC, and its 
trough concentration was reduced significantly after the ad￾ministration of EVL (P < 0.01). CNI administration was not 
discontinued in any patient during the study period. All pa￾tients had received MMF at baseline. Twelve patients discon￾tinued MMF by the first month after the administration of 
EVL, and one discontinued MMF by the first year after the ad￾ministration of EVL. No patients restarted MMF during the 
study period.
The main indication for the administration of EVL was 
(1) a combination of CNI-induced renal impairment and 
MMF-induced neutropenia [6 patients (30.0%)], (2) MMF-in￾duced neutropenia and diarrhea [6 patients (30.0%)], (3) pro￾gression of CAV [6 patients (30.0%)], and (4) recurrent rejec￾tion episodes that developed against triple combination therapy 
including CNI, MMF, and prednisolone [2 patients (10.0%)].
The neutrophil count averaged 2409 ± 1846/μL at base￾line, and increased significantly after the administration of 
EVL (P < 0.01). Mean eGFR was 58.9 ± 33.6 mL/minute/1.73 
m2
 at baseline, increased to 71.3 ± 39.8 mL/minute/1.73 m2
 af￾ter 1 month (P = 0.001 versus baseline), and stabilized at 76.1 
± 49.4 mL/minute/m2
 after 1 year (P < 0.001 versus baseline). 
All lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density li￾poprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
triglycerides had increased slightly after 1 month but returned 
to baseline after 1 year. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia 
was positive in 12 recipients (60.0%) at baseline, and CMV 
antigenemia assay remained negative in all recipients after the 
administration of EVL without any antiviral drug administra￾tion.
Immunosuppressant and renal function: Relative changes in 
the trough concentrations of CNIs showed a strong correlation 
with %changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
after the administration of EVL (r = -0.557 and P = 0.011 after 
1 month, r = -0.807 and P < 0.001 after 1 year) (Figure 1). The 
trough concentration of EVL was slightly negatively correlated 
with %changes in eGFR at 1 month after the administration of 
EVL (r = -0.406, P = 0.058) (Figure 2A). There was no corre￾lation with the changes in dose of MMF and %changes in 
eGFR at 1 month after the administration of EVL (r = 0.269, P

= 0.252) (Figure 2B). Figure 3A shows that baseline eGFR 
was slightly negatively correlated with the %changes in eGFR 
among patients with mild to severely progressed renal dys￾function (< 90 mL/minute/1.73 m2
 of eGFR) at 1 month after 
the administration of EVL (r = -0.273, P = 0.174). There was 
no correlation between the timing of EVL administration and 
the improvement of renal function at 1 month after the admin￾istration of EVL (r = 0.264, P = 0.298) (Figure 3B).
Immunosuppressant and neutrophil count: All recipients had 
received MMF before the administration of EVL, and the 
mean dose was 1525 ± 638 mg/day. The mean dose of MMF 
after 1 month and 1 year was 638 ± 992 and 672 ± 1036 mg/

a strong negative correlation with the %changes in neutrophil 
count after the administration of EVL (r = -0.570 and P = 
0.009 after 1 month, r = -0.671 and P = 0.009 after 1 year) 
(Figure 4). There was no correlation between the %changes in 
neutrophil count and trough levels of EVL or the %changes in 
the trough concentrations of CNIs (r = 0.219, P = 0.213, and r
= 0.184, P = 0.184, respectively).
Adverse events: There were no major adverse events associat￾ed with EVL such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphocoele, 
pneumonitis, impaired wound healing, or proteinuria, although 
stomatitis was common in almost every patient treated with 
EVL. Two patients experienced rejection; ISHLT grade 2R on 
day 623 and grade 3R at day 30, after the administration of 
EVL, and each rejection was treated by single steroid pulse 
therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the proportion of 
patients free from rejection among HTx recipients with EVL 
treatment was slightly better than those without EVL (P = 
0.132) (Figure 5).
Discussion
In the present study, we administered EVL, an inhibitor 
of mammalian target of rapamycin, along with a reduction or 
discontinuation of MMF and/or CNIs in HTx recipients and 
then followed them for 1 year. We found that the %increase in 
eGFR or neutrophil count was significantly correlated with the 
%decrease in the dosage of CNI or MMF, respectively. Moreo￾ver, we could introduce EVL safely while maintaining rejec￾tion rates as low as a standard immunosuppressant regimen 
without EVL.
Recently, EVL has been demonstrated to be advanta￾geous in various aspects, including prophylactic potentials of 
CMV infection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV),20-24)
a less myelosuppressive character compared with MMF,20) and 
less renal toxicity compared with CNIs.9,11,15-17,25,26) Several rec￾ommendations for an indication for EVL have been recently 
proposed considering the above advantages of EVL,12-14) and 
we initiate EVL administration in principle on the basis of 
these recommendations as mentioned in the methods.
With respect to CMV infection, we previously reported 
that EVL might inhibit CMV proliferation through down-regu￾lation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, whose ac￾tivation is essential for viral replication,20,21) Consistently with 
previous clinical reports, we found no patients had a CMV in￾fection after the introduction of EVL even though several re￾cipients were CMV-seronegative. It has been suggested that 
CMV infection plays an important role in the pathogenesis of 
CAV,27) and minimizing CMV infections may be one of the 
key mechanisms by which EVL prevents CAV.24)
MMF is one of the standard immunosuppressants for 
HTx recipients, and neutropenia is not uncommonly associated 
with MMF treatment.26) Neutropenia is further worsened when 
MMF is administered simultaneously with valganciclovir for 
the treatment of CMV infection because of their synergistic 
myelosuppressive effects as we also previously reported.20,28)
Although there are few reports on the dose-dependent effects

of MMF in neutropenia, we have demonstrated that %increas￾es in neutrophil count were closely correlated with %decreases 
in the dose of MMF at 1 month after the administration of 
EVL, and that the trend continued for 1 year after the adminis￾tration of EVL. Digestive tract symptoms including diarrhea 
are also notorious adverse effects of MMF,26) and avoiding di￾arrhea is desirable in order to ensure absorption of immuno￾suppressant drugs through the gastrointestinal tract. After 
switching to EVL from MMF, no patient in the present study 
suffered digestive tract symptoms. These results indicate, 
therefore, that EVL can be a real alternative to MMF.
Recent studies have demonstrated that administration of 
EVL along with reduced CNI administration could spare renal 
function among patients who underwent heart or kidney trans￾plantation.9,11,26) An expert panel reported that the introduction 
threshold should be a serum creatinine concentration of 2.0 
mg/dL.15) We normally commence EVL administration if se￾rum creatinine levels exceed 1.5 mg/dLwhich takes into con￾sideration a different calculation method for eGFR in Japanese 
patients. Among recipients with an eGFR < 90 mL/
minute/1.73 m2
, we found that CNI reduction met much more 
increases in eGFR in the patients with lower baseline renal 
function. This observation indicates that patients with de￾creased renal function might receive more benefit from CNI 
reduction. However, it is believed that recipients with advanced 
renal dysfunction (eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2
) would not 
respond to CNI reduction because of depletion of their recov￾ery potential. In fact, the German-Austrian Certican Consensus 
Conference recommended that recipients should have a GFR 
of > 40 mL/minute/1.73 m2
 to benefit substantially from a re￾duction of CNI while adding EVL considering their potential 
for recovery of renal function.12) We could not address this ap￾parent discrepancy, since there were no patients with such ad￾vanced renal dysfunction (< 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2
 of eGFR) 
in this study.
Only a few reports have analyzed the quantitative rela￾tionship between the amount of CNI reduction and recovery of 
renal function.29) We demonstrated here quantitatively that 
%decreases in the dose reduction of CNI were closely corre￾lated with %increases in eGFR at 1 month after the administra￾tion of EVL, and that the trend continued for 1 year after the 
administration of EVL. How much should the dose of CNI be 
reduced when EVL will be administered? The relative reduc￾tions of CyA and TAC in our study were 36.8% and 36.4%, re￾spectively, and were similar to previous recommendations (25-
50% dose reduction of CNI).12-14) It was reported that complete 
withdrawal of a CNI after EVL initiation could further im￾prove renal function without risk of rejection after heart or kid￾ney transplantation.16,17) However, a CNI-free immunosuppres￾sant regimen with EVL has not yet replaced a conventional 
CNI-dominant regimen because of a lack of evidence. In fact, 
a CNI-free regimen had a slightly higher probability of rejec￾tion18) and might increase donor-specific HLA antibodies 
among renal transplantation recipients.30)
A second issue is when EVL should be initiated after 
HTx. Gude, et al recently reported that an improvement in re￾nal function after switching to EVL treatment was more likely 
within the first year post-HTx (early group) compared with 
several years after HTx (late group), because a long-injured 
kidney might have lost the ability to recover even after the dis￾continuation of CNI.10) Inconsistently with their reports, we 
found no correlation between the timing of EVL initiation and 
amount of recovery in renal function, which was probably be￾cause EVL was started within 1 year after HTx in most of our 
patients. However, in our study, a couple of patients in whom 
EVL was initiated several years after HTx also benefitted from 
CNI reduction in terms of renal function. Further studies are 
needed to clarify this point.
An association between EVL and impaired wound heal￾ing after major surgery due to the inhibition of fibroblast pro￾liferation by EVL has been reported.31) Wound healing is an 
important issue, especially in Japanese HTx recipients since 
approximately 90% of them receive ventricular assist devices 
during their waiting period.32) The median duration until EVL 
introduction was 349 days post-HTx in our institute, but 2 pa￾tients were administered EVL within 2 months after bridging 
to HTx from ventricular assist devices without any complica￾tions, including incomplete wound healing. In fact, several 
groups have recommended that EVL could be started even as 
little as 1 week after normal surgery.12-14) The risk of CMV in￾fection is extremely high among CMV-seronegative recipients 
given a CMV-seropositive donor heart.33) Introduction of EVL 
with reduced CNI as early as 2 months after HTx might be 
considered in such a specific situation, with an expectation it 
will have a prophylactic effect on CMV infection.20-23)
EVL has been reported to be associated with adverse ef￾fects that include renal toxicity and a worsening of lipid me￾tabolism. Several authors reported that EVL inhibits glomeru￾lar endothelial cell proliferation and vascular endothelial 
growth factor, and eventually may decrease renal function, al￾beit to a relatively modest degree.34,35) We consistently found 
that higher trough levels of EVL had a weak but negative im￾pact on eGFR. Although the renal toxicity of EVL is close to 
negligible compared with that of CNI, longer administration of 
EVL may have the disadvantage to preserve renal function. 
Evidence based on further observation is still needed.
With regards to lipid metabolism, EVL has been reported 
to worsen hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia by 
inhibiting the degradation and excretion of cholesterol.36,37)
Though the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-den￾sity lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholester￾ol, and triglycerides were slightly increased 1 month after the 
administration of EVL, these lipid parameters had returned to 
baseline after 1 year by titration of statin or additional adminis￾tration of ezetimibe. The adverse effects of EVL on lipid me￾tabolism may be managed sufficiently in the current era in 
which potent antihyperlipidemic drugs are readily available.5,13)
The present study has several limitations. First, it was 
conducted in a single center, and consequently included a lim￾ited number of patients because of a shortage of donor hearts 
in Japan. We expect the number of HTx to increase due to 
amendment of the organ transplantation law in July 2010, 
which will strengthen our analyses. Second, there was a limita￾tion associated with patient selection bias, and further investi￾gations in prospective trials should be performed. Third, we 
analyzed the effect of CNI reduction with administration of 
EVL for 1 year after HTx. A longer observation period would 
be needed to analyze the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolera￾bility of EVL.
In conclusion, an immunosuppressant regimen consisting 
of dose reductions of CNIs and MMF together with the initia￾tion of EVL administration can overcome drug-induced ad-

verse effects such as renal dysfunction and neutropenia while 
maintaining a low rejection rate. Earlier initiation of EVL 
should be considered, particularly in the case of CMV-sero￾negative recipients with a seropositive donor heart.
