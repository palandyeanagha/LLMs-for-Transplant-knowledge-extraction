Abstract
Background: Periodontal infections are hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse systemic outcomes through
inflammatory mechanisms. The magnitude of effect, if any, of anti-infective periodontal treatment on systemic
inflammation is unknown, as are the patient populations most likely to benefit. We conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test the hypothesis that anti-infective periodontal treatment
reduces systemic c-reactive protein (CRP).
Methods and Findings: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases were searched using sensitivity￾enhancing search terms. Eligible RCTs enrolled patients with periodontal infection, compared a clearly defined anti￾infective periodontal intervention (experimental group) to an “inactive control” (no periodontal intervention) or to an
“active control” (lower treatment intensity than the experimental group). Mean differences in final CRP values at the
earliest post-treatment time point (typically 1-3 months) between experimental and control groups were analyzed
using random-effects regression. Among 2,753 possible studies 20 were selected, which included 2,561 randomized
patients(median=57). Baseline CRP values were >3.0 mg/L in 40% of trials. Among studies with a control group
receiving no treatment, the mean difference in CRP final values among experimental treatment vs. control groups
was -0.37 mg/L [95%CI=-0.64, -0.11], (P=0.005), favoring experimental treatment. Trials for which the experimental
group received antibiotics had stronger effects (P for interaction=0.03) and the mean difference in CRP final values
among experimental treatment vs. control was -0.75 mg/L [95%CI=-1.17,-0.33]. No treatment effect was observed
among studies using an active treatment comparator. Treatment effects were stronger for studies that included
patients with co-morbidities vs. studies that included “systemically healthy” patients, although the interaction was not
significant (P=0.48).
Conclusions: Anti-infective periodontal treatment results in short-term modest reductions in systemic CRP.

Introduction
Periodontal infections have been hypothesized as a risk
factor for several adverse health outcomes. Observational
studies have linked periodontal infection with increased risk for
developing subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease[1–5],
poor glycemic control among individuals with diabetes[6–9],
increased diabetes risk[10–14], adverse pregnancy
outcomes[15,16], and the development of rheumatoid
arthritis[17–20].
Chronic inflammation is a potential mechanism linking
periodontal infection with the aforementioned systemic
inflammatory outcomes. Elevated inflammatory biomarkers,
such as C-reactive protein (CRP), have been consistently
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77441

shown to increase the risk for clinical outcomes such as
cardiovascular disease[21,22] and type 2 diabetes[23,24].
Exposure to select microbes in dysbiotic subgingival biofilms
might elicit a chronic low-grade inflammatory phenotype.
Therefore, anti-infective periodontal therapies that reduce
exposure to subgingival pathogenic microbes are a plausible
anti-inflammatory intervention. A recent American Heart
Association Scientific Statement on periodontal infections and
atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) concluded that
“periodontal interventions result in a reduction in systemic
inflammation”[25] based on several randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) showing reductions in inflammatory markers after
periodontal treatment. The Scientific Statement also
recognized that “the effects of therapy on specific inflammatory
markers are not consistent across studies”[25] which is
supported by the current literature including several RCTs
showing either no treatment effect or increased inflammatory
biomarkers after periodontal treatment. The heterogeneity
observed in previous studies could arise from a number of
factors including study bias, variation in treatment protocols
and differences in patient characteristics/co-morbidities.
Therefore, at least three critical questions remain
unanswered: i) the overall magnitude of effect, if any, of anti￾infective periodontal treatment on systemic inflammation and
the clinical meaningfulness of these effects; ii) whether
adjunctive antibiotics result in greater reductions in
inflammation; iii) and whether treatment effects are greater
among patients with underlying co-morbidities. These
questions are important for both future research and current
clinical practice.
We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
of randomized controlled trials to comprehensively assess the
overall evidence regarding CRP effects following anti-infective
periodontal treatment. We further examined whether or not the
influence of treatment on CRP levels varied according to
treatment protocol or patient co-morbidities. CRP is the primary
outcome in the study because it is a common surrogate of
systemic inflammation and the only inflammatory outcome for
which clinical recommendations exist (for patients at
intermediate cardiovascular disease risk)[26].
Methods
The a priori review protocol was published with the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO) under registration# CRD42011001775. This
report complies with the preferred reporting items of PRISMA
for systematic reviews and meta-analyses[27].
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies. We included randomized controlled trials
with available CRP data. There was no minimum trial duration.
Types of participants. Trials that enrolled adult patients
with periodontal infection (i.e., gingivitis or periodontitis) were
eligible.
Types of interventions. Eligible studies used any surgical
or nonsurgical periodontal treatment with or without antibiotics
or other chemical adjuncts. Scaling and root planing (SRP), a
mainstay in periodontal therapy, was reported in all but one
study and is defined by the American Academy of
Periodontology as “a non-surgical procedure where the
therapist removes plaque and calculus from the periodontal
pocket and around the tooth root and smooths the root
surfaces to promote healing.” Control groups were defined as
“inactive” if any of the following occurred during the same
study period as the experimental group: i) there was no
periodontal treatment; ii) oral hygiene instruction (OHI) was
provided; iii) supragingival cleaning was performed; iv) teeth
with disease so severe that treatment was not indicated were
extracted. We also considered trials in which the control group
received an “active” periodontal treatment with a distinctly
lower treatment intensity than the experimental group, e.g.,
SRP + antibiotic treatment in the experimental group vs. SRP
alone in the control group. Referral to “community periodontal
care” was considered an active treatment protocol.
Types of outcome measures. The primary outcome was
the CRP level after periodontal treatment because it is
commonly studied as an inflammatory outcome in periodontal
treatment studies and also has clinical utility[26]. The primary
outcome was based on the CRP measurement at the shortest
duration from treatment completion, with the requirement that
at least two weeks separated treatment completion and post￾treatment CRP measurement. In a secondary analysis, we
considered the CRP level at 3-month follow-up, as it was the
most frequently reported post-treatment time point assessed.
Secondary outcomes included the local clinical measures of
inflammation, bleeding on probing and probing depth, which
serve as markers of anti-infective treatment success.
Search methods for identification of studies
We searched Pubmed/MEDLINE (up to February 6th, 2013)
and the Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register,
EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL(up to March 2012). There
was no date restriction but only publications in the English
language were reviewed. The search equation for MEDLINE is
reported in Table S1 in File S1. In addition we searched the
references of all identified studies for more trials as well as the
conference proceedings from the three most recent years of
the two main meetings for the following specialties: dentistry,
cardiology, obstetrics, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology.
We also searched the WHO international clinical trials register
platform.
Data collection
Selection of studies. Two independent reviewers blinded
to the results of the other reviewer first screened all records at
the title level. To enhance sensitivity, records were only
removed if both reviewers excluded at the title level. The
second level of review was at the abstract level followed by
another round of review at the full-text level.
Data extraction and management. Two independent
reviewers (in duplicate) abstracted data using a standardized
form. When there was disagreement it was resolved by
discussion with a third review author. There were no
discrepancies in the determination of CRP outcome values or
bias assessments. Corresponding authors were contacted via
Periodontal Treatment and C-Reactive Protein
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77441

e-mail at least three times to obtain data if the CRP outcomes
could not be readily abstracted from the publication.
Assessment of risk of bias in selected trials. Two
reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the tool
described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions[28]. Risk of bias was rated as low, high or
unclear regarding: i) sequence generation; ii) allocation
concealment; iii) blinding; and iv) completeness of outcome
data.
Data synthesis
Measure of treatment effect and meta-analyses. For the
primary outcome - CRP values at the earliest time point after
treatment completion - we measured the treatment effect using
mean difference (MD) in final values between the experimental
and control groups. Negative values favor experimental group
over control group. For the secondary outcomes - bleeding on
probing (as a percentage) and probing depth in millimeters
(mm) - the treatment effect was measured using mean
differences in final values between the experimental and
control groups. Trials with multiple experimental groups were
included separately using a shared control group divided out
approximately evenly among the comparisons. Because of the
expected clinical diversity, meta-analyses were performed by
using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. To
assess heterogeneity across trials, we used forest plots as well
as Cochran’s heterogeneity statistics and Higgins I2
coefficients. We produced funnel plots to assess small-study
effects.
Active-inactive trials and active-active trials were synthesized
separately. We repeated all syntheses with the measurements
at 3-month follow-up. The same methods were used to
synthesize data regarding bleeding on probing and probing
depth.
Sensitivity analyses. To incorporate potential differences in
baseline values within or between trials, we also analyzed
change scores. For the analysis of change scores, the within￾group correlation coefficient (ρ) between baseline and final
values is required but was never reported. We requested, and
were provided with, the original CRP data from the largest trial
included in this meta-analysis[29]. Among the 620 participants
from that trial, the correlation between pre- and post-treatment
raw CRP values was 0.43 and the correlation between log￾transformed values was 0.64. We performed a sensitivity
analysis using a variety of values for ρ (0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75).
As results were very similar and based on correlations
observed in the original data provided by Michalowicz et al.
[29], we report the results for ρ=0.5. We also performed a
meta-regression analysis of final CRP values regressed on
baseline CRP values and intervention status.
To account for the potentially skewed distribution of CRP, we
performed a sensitivity analysis by transforming the data to the
logarithmic scale[30]. The meta-analysis of data on the
logarithmic scale gave similar results; thus we chose to present
the non log transformed results to simplify interpretation.
To account for incomplete outcome data, we performed
sensitivity analyses by imputing missing outcome data. First,
we conservatively assumed that the mean CRP final value
among patients with missing outcome data in the experimental
group was 10% larger than observed for complete cases in the
experimental group and that mean CRP final values among
controls with missing data were 10% lower[31]. Second, we
assumed that the mean CRP final value in participants with
missing outcome data was equal to that in complete cases in
the control group.
Subgroup analyses. We performed two subgroup analyses
based on the use of antibiotics (periodontal interventions that
included antibiotics vs. those that did not), and on the presence
of comorbidities (healthy patients vs. patients with type 2
diabetes vs. patients with other comorbidities). Interaction tests
were performed through meta-regression models.
All analysis were done using Stata MP version 11.0.
Results
Description of studies
Results of the search. Among the initial 2,753 records
identified, 53 articles were reviewed at the full-text level and 25
were eligible (Figure 1). Among those, we could not exclude
the possibility that two papers included a group of patients
common to both studies arising from one three-arm trial[32,33];
we selected the original report[32] as the subsequent
publication reported results for two arms only. Among the 24
trials, appropriate CRP data could not be abstracted from 8
trials (typically because data were presented graphically and
not numerically). The corresponding and/or first authors from
these 8 trials were contacted and we obtained CRP data for 4
out of 8 trials, yielding a total of 20[29,32,34–51] included trials.
Characteristics of included trials and
interventions. Characteristics of included trials and
interventions are summarized in Table 1 and in Tables S1-S2
in File S1. All but 3 trials were single-center trials. The 20
included trials were conducted across 14 different countries
and 5 continents.

Among the 20 selected trials, 18 were two-arm trials and 2
were three-arm trials. Among the three-arm trials, one
compared SRP+antibiotics versus SRP versus no treatment,
the other compared SRP at baseline and 3 months versus SRP
at baseline only versus no treatment. Overall, there were 18
randomized comparisons between an active periodontal
treatment and an “inactive” control group (no periodontal
treatment, OHI or supragingival cleaning) and 6 randomized
comparisons of an active periodontal treatment to an “active”
control but with lower treatment intensity(Table 1 and Table S3
in File S1). The 4 excluded studies[52–55] (because CRP data
could not be obtained) addressed comparisons of an active
periodontal treatment to an active control with lower treatment
intensity.
Characteristics of patients. The 20 selected studies
included 2,561 randomized patients. The median trial size was
57 patients. All patients were adults between the ages of 26
and 60 years, with an overall mean age of 44 years; the two
studies with the lowest mean patient ages enrolled pregnant
women. Both genders were well represented (Table 1).
Patients were frequently enrolled based on the presence of co￾Table 1. Descriptive characteristics of 20 selected trials.

morbidities or pregnancy, 7 studies enrolled patients with pre￾diabetes or diabetes mellitus, 6 studies enrolled patients with a
variety of other co-morbidities and 2 studies enrolled pregnant
women (Table 1).
All patients had periodontitis although the definitions used for
inclusion varied greatly. All but two studies[45,48] required
clinical evidence of current periodontal inflammation
(i.e., multiple sites with either bleeding on probing (BOP) or
probing depths (PD) ≥4 mm). At baseline, the overall mean
values of PD and % of periodontal sites with BOP were 3.4 mm
and 54% across all studies, respectively. The median CRP
value at baseline was 3.1 mg/L and 90% and 40% of study
populations had a mean CRP level of ≥1.0 mg/L or >3.0 mg/L,
respectively.
Risk of bias of included trials. Overall, 10 trials had a low
risk of selection bias as the sequence of generation and
allocation concealment were adequate (Figure 2 and Figure S1
in File S1); in the remaining 10 trials, the risk of bias was
unclear because it was not explicitly described whether
sequence generation and/or allocation concealment was
adequately done. Of note, 3 trials used an unequal
randomization ratio of 2:1[34,36,47]. Protection against
performance and detection biases was adequate as
participants, personnel and outcome assessment (CRP level is
objectively measured) were blinded. However, there was high
risk of attrition bias in 4 trials because the proportion of patients
with missing outcome data was substantial, ranging from 22%
to 51%, with imbalances between the experimental and control
group in 2 trials.
Efficacy of active periodontal treatment versus inactive
control on systemic CRP
Overall, 16 trials contributed to 18 randomized comparisons
between an active periodontal treatment, with or without
antibiotics, and an inactive control group. The meta-analysis
showed that final CRP values (earliest follow-up time point)
were significantly lower, on average, in the active periodontal
group than in the inactive control group (combined MD=-0.37
mg/L, 95%CI=-0.64 to -0.11, P=0.005, Figure 3). Statistical
heterogeneity was moderate (Cochran’s heterogeneity test
P=0.10; I2
 coefficient=32%).
The meta-analysis of change scores yielded stronger results
(combined MD=-1.50, 95%CI=-2.11 to -0.89, P<0.001, Figure
S2 in File S1), although heterogeneity was considerable. The
meta-regression analysis also showed that the mean final CRP
values were strongly positively associated with mean pre￾Figure 2. Risk of bias graph.

treatment values, but were lower after active periodontal
treatment than inactive control (mean difference in final CRP
values between active periodontal treatment and inactive
control, adjusted for mean baseline CRP values=-0.34 mg/L
(95%CI=-0.60 to -0.10), P=0.006, Figure S3 in File S1).
A reanalysis following imputation of missing outcome data
indicated that our results were robust for the 2 hypotheses
considered (Figures S4-S5 in File S1). Results were also
consistent when only considering studies that reported CRP
outcomes at 3 months (Figure S6 in File S1).
Subgroup Analysis
Among studies using untreated control groups, the difference
in final CRP values was larger for experimental groups
receiving adjunctive antibiotics (combined MD=-0.75,
95%CI=-1.17 to -0.33, with low heterogeneity) than for groups
without antibiotics (combined MD=-0.19, 95%CI=-0.47 to 0.09,
with low heterogeneity; P for interaction=0.03; Figure 3).
Among studies with an active comparator, only 3 of 6 trials
compare periodontal therapy+antibiotics to periodontal therapy
alone[50,51,56] and these results show no evidence that
antibiotic therapy provides stronger reductions in CRP.
However, there is considerable heterogeneity between study.
The difference in final CRP values between active
periodontal treatment and inactive control was larger in patients
with diabetes or another comorbidity than in healthy patients
(two of which included only pregnant women), although there
was no statistically significant interaction (P=0.32; Figure S7 in
File S1).
Funnel plots did not show evidence of small-study bias
(Figure S8 in File S1).
Efficacy of active periodontal treatment versus active
control on systemic CRP
Overall, 6 trials contributed to comparisons between an
active periodontal treatment and an active control group but
Figure 3. Efficacy of active periodontal therapy versus
inactive control on post-treatment CRP values. 
doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0077441.g003
with lower intensity (totaling 527 patients). The meta-analysis
showed that, on average, final CRP values (earliest follow-up
time point) did not differ between the two (combined MD=-0.05,
95%CI=-0.59,0.50; Figure 4), with moderate statistical
heterogeneity (Cochran’s heterogeneity test P=0.05; I2
coefficient=55%). Among the 4 studies excluded because CRP
data were not obtained[52–55], 362 patients were enrolled; one
showed greater CRP reductions in the experimental group,
three showed greater reductions in the control group but none
reported statistically significant CRP treatment effects.
Efficacy of experimental interventions on periodontal
inflammation
Among studies reporting BOP outcomes, treatment reduced
absolute BOP values by 20% on average (P<0.05; substantial
heterogeneity across trials); when considering both the earliest
post-intervention time point or a 3-month time point, results
were notably stronger for designs using an inactive control
(Figure S9 in File S1). Similarly, mean probing depth values
decreased by 0.61 mm more, on average, among treated than
control groups (P<0.05; substantial heterogeneity across trials)
although the effect of treatment was stronger and only
statistically significant for studies without an active treatment
comparator (Figure S10 in File S1).
Discussion
We have found that anti-infective periodontal treatment
reduces post-treatment systemic CRP values by ~0.4 mg/L,
among adult men and women. When considering periodontal
interventions that included antibiotics, as compared to
untreated control groups, the CRP reductions were 0.75 mg/L,
although greater CRP reductions were not observed in studies
using active comparators. There was also evidence to suggest
that anti-infective treatment resulted in greater CRP reductions
among individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus
as compared to CRP reductions observed in studies enrolling
apparently healthy patients although the interaction was not
statistically significant.

The finding that anti-infective periodontal treatment reduces
levels of an established systemic inflammatory biomarker
strengthens the hypothesis that adverse exposure to microbes
in dysbiotic periodontal biofilms contribute to chronic systemic
inflammation. Accordingly, the current findings further
strengthen the hypothesis that periodontal infections may
independently contribute to the development of chronic
diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease since
inflammation is a commonly cited biological mechanism
underlying these associations[4,57].
To our knowledge, the only recommendation for use of CRP
in clinical and/or public health practice was published by a joint
American Heart Association (AHA)/Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) working group[26]. The working group endorsed the
optional use of hs-CRP in primary prevention settings to
identify “patients at intermediate risk (eg, 10% to 20% risk of
coronary heart disease over 10 years), in whom the physician
may need additional information to guide considerations of
further evaluation”.
While it is not known whether the magnitude of CRP
reductions associated with periodontal intervention in this
meta-analysis can reduce clinical cardiovascular outcomes,
results from two trials published subsequent to the AHA/CDC
statement have demonstrated that statin therapies which
reduced clinical cardiovascular outcomes also lowered CRP. In
the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention (JUPITER)
trial, patients without an LDL-cholesterol indication for statin
treatment randomized to Rosuvastatin realized a reduction in
median CRP values that were 1.2 mg/L greater than patients
randomized to placebo. This translated into a 44% reduction in
incident clinical cardiovascular events after 12 months[58].
Similarly, the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and
Infection Therapy- Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22
(PROVE IT–TIMI 22) study[59] reported that after treatment
with 40 mg of pravastatin vs. 80 mg of atorvastatin CRP levels
were reduced 0.7 and 0.8 mg/L after 30 days and four months,
respectively, and that these declines resulted in CVD event
rate reductions equivalent to what was observed for patients
who achieved LDL-cholesterol treatment goals. Therefore,
CRP reductions associated with anti-infective periodontal
treatment in this meta-analysis are of a similar magnitude as
CRP reductions that have been associated with reduced
clinical CVD event rates.
In the context of primary diabetes prevention, we are
unaware of trials that have investigated CRP reduction for the
prevention of diabetes development. However, high-quality
observational data from the Women’s Health Study offer some
insights. Pradhan et al. reported that during a four-year follow
up period, elevated baseline CRP was associated with a 30%
increase in the risk for incident diabetes when comparing
participants in the second vs. first quartile of CRP, which
corresponded to a difference in median CRP values of 1.2
mg/L[23]. Elevated CRP has been recently shown in a
systematic review and meta-analysis to be associated with an
~30% increase in the risk of diabetes development[60]. The
results were based on ten prospective studies including
>19,000 participants and >4,000 diabetes cases.
From a secondary diabetes prevention standpoint, there is
evidence from randomized controlled trials that anti-infective
periodontal treatment improves glycemic control among
patients with diabetes[61] and the current findings offer insights
as to the possible biological mechanisms underlying those
findings. Of note, in accordance with our current results,
periodontal treatment trials targeting glycemic control among
diabetics have also demonstrated stronger treatment effects
when antibiotics are used[61].
If anti-infective periodontal treatment can be demonstrated to
not only reduce systemic inflammation but also prevent
adverse chronic disease outcomes it would be of high public
health and clinical importance for at least two reasons. First,
periodontal interventions have been shown to be safe[62,63]
and often do not require pharmacological agents thus reducing
the potential for adverse events and offering new treatment
options for individuals with contraindications for anti￾inflammatory medications such as statins or aspirin. The fact
that recent evidence suggests a very modest increase in
diabetes risk among statin users[64] is also a reason to
possibly consider alternate anti-inflammatory treatment
modalities among patients at intermediate CVD risk[26].
Moreover, because periodontal treatment is necessary for the
maintenance of good oral health among patients with
periodontitis, referring patients for periodontal evaluation, and
possible treatment, is a reasonable first step in managing
inflammatory burden among at risk patients.
Beyond their clinical and public health implications, the
current findings also offer some useful insights for future
research endeavors that are necessary to test whether or not
anti-infective periodontal treatment can prevent the
development of clinical outcomes such as diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. Studies using “active control” groups
that receive a lower intensity treatment regimen than the
experiment treatment failed to demonstrate CRP reductions.
This was possibly the result of small differences in realized
levels of exposure to adverse microbial species (the treatment
target) between groups that each received periodontal therapy.
This notion is supported by the fact that designs using “low￾intensity” treatments protocols in the control arm also reported
much weaker reductions in clinical periodontal outcomes (i.e.,
probing depth and bleeding on probing). Consequently, future
trials may need to be optimized via innovative designs that
allow for an untreated control group so long as appropriate
data safety and monitoring plans are in place to ensure patient
safety.
Two previous meta-analyses have been published regarding
the contribution of periodontal infection to systemic
inflammation[65,66]. While these reports were informative they
were limited in a few important ways. Ioannidou et al. reported
a mean difference of CRP change between experimental and
control groups from only two studies[32,67] one of which was
not an RCT and post-treatment CRP was assessed on the
same day[67]. In a second meta-analysis, Paraskevas et al.
concluded that periodontal treatment significantly reduced CRP
levels although only two studies[56,68] were included in the
analysis that yielded a statistically significant 0.5 mg/L CRP

reduction and neither of these two studies were randomized
controlled trials.
The majority of studies identified in this review enrolled
patients with mean CRP levels below the high risk AHA/CDC
category (3.0 mg/L) which might have impacted the strength of
findings since a certain threshold of inflammation might be
necessary before anti-infective/inflammatory treatments can be
useful[21]. However, the results demonstrate that CRP
reductions were realized regardless of baseline CRP levels
suggesting that anti-infective treatments can reduce
inflammation even among participants with CRP<3.0 mg/L.
As with any meta-analysis, we cannot rule out the possibility
that exclusion of unpublished trials or lack of data access and
loss-to-follow-up among published trials might have biased our
results towards a positive finding. The fact that there was no
evidence of publication bias in addition to the consistent results
showing treatment benefit arising from conservative sensitivity
analyses substantially mitigates these concerns. Our attempts
to obtain original data from studies for which results could not
be abstracted also minimize the potential for bias. Another
possible bias in this research area is the difficulty in using
placebo controlled double-blind studies, which could result in
overestimates of treatment effects. For example, patients who
know they are receiving treatment might be more motivated to
make other lifestyle changes (smoking cessation, dietary
changes etc.) that could influence inflammatory outcomes.
We observed evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects
across studies which might be accounted for by a number of
factors such as severity of baseline infection or CRP levels,
different underlying patient co-morbidities or medications, or
variation in treatment modalities. In regard to the latter, it is
notable that heterogeneity was minimized when analyzing
subgroups with more homogenous treatment protocols (e.g.,
periodontal treatment + antibiotics vs. control groups without
any treatment).
Anti-infective periodontal therapy among adult men and
women with periodontitis results in modest short-term systemic
CRP reductions based on results from 20 randomized
controlled trials conducted in 14 different countries across 5
continents. Whether or not these CRP reductions can translate
into decreased rates of clinical cardiovascular disease or
diabetes development remains to be determined in future
clinical trials as no such trial has been conducted to date. Until
such trials are performed, the evidence suggests that among
patients with periodontal infection, periodontal treatment can
confer the dual advantage of improved oral health and short￾term reduction in systemic inflammatory activity.
