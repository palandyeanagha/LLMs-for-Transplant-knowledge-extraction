ARTICLE FIGURES AND DATA INFO AND METRICS
Abstract
Advances in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle
cell disease have improved outcomes, but there is limited analysis
of healthcare utilization in this setting. We hypothesized that,
compared to late transplantation, early transplantation (at age <10
years) improves outcomes and decreases healthcare utilization. We
performed a retrospective study of children transplanted for sickle
cell disease in the USA during 2000–2013 using two large
databases. Univariate and Cox models were used to estimate
associations of demographics, sickle cell disease severity, and
transplant-related variables with mortality and chronic graft-versus-
host disease, while Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, or linear trend tests


were applied for the estimates of healthcare utilization. Among 161
patients with a 2-year overall survival rate of 90% (95% confidence
interval [CI] 85–95%) mortality was significantly higher in those
who underwent late transplantation versus early (hazard ratio (HR)
21, 95% CI 2.8–160.8, P=0.003) and unrelated compared to
matched sibling donor transplantation (HR 5.9, 95% CI 1.7–20.2,
P=0.005). Chronic graftversus host disease was significantly more
frequent among those translanted late (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.5,
P=0.034) and those who received an unrelated graft (HR 2.5, 95%
CI 1.2–5.4; P=0.017). Merged data for 176 patients showed that
the median total adjusted transplant cost per patient was $467,747
(range: $344,029–$799,219). Healthcare utilization was lower
among recipients of matched sibling donor grafts and those with
low severity disease compared to those with other types of donor
and disease severity types (P<0.001 and P=0.022, respectively);
no association was demonstrated with late transplantation
(P=0.775). Among patients with 2-year pre- and post-transplant
data (n=41), early transplantation was associated with significant
reductions in admissions (P<0.001), length of stay (P<0.001), and
cost (P=0.008). Early transplant outcomes need to be studied
prospectively in young children without severe disease and an
available matched sibling to provide conclusive evidence for the
superiority of this approach. Reduced post-transplant healthcare
utilization inpatient care indicates that transplantation may provide
a sustained decrease in healthcare costs over time.
Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 people in
the United States of America (USA) with 2,000 new cases detected
via newborn screening annually. There is a lack of clinical
predictors to estimate overall outcomes of SCD-associated
morbidities, including painful crises and organ dysfunction, which
respond variably to medical management, have a devastating
impact on quality of life, and can lead to premature death.1 As a
result, many people with SCD are left with sequelae of the disease
and its complications. Allogeneic hematopoi-etic cell
transplantation (alloHCT) remains the only established curative
option for these individuals.


Despite mounting evidence of rising alloHCT success rates over
time, such that the 5-year disease-free survival in children with SCD
is now 92%, many still regard alloHCT as an experimental therapy,
only for patients with severe disease.32 The indications for alloHCT
remain unclear for non-transplant providers when compared to the
benefits of medical management.4 In addition, a recent
retrospective study from Belgium suggested that patients with SCD
managed medically with hydroxyurea may have a better survival
than those treated with alloHCT.5
However, short-term improvements in outcome with medical
therapy must be balanced against a disease with an unpredictable
clinical course and substantial impact on healthcare utilization. USA
individuals with SCD account for an estimated $1.6 billion per year
in healthcare costs.6 SCD ranked fifth among the top ten diagnoses
of hospital stays among Medicaid super-utilizers.7 The substantial
healthcare utilization and cost of SCD-related morbidity suggests
that a greater focus on curative approaches for this disease is
needed.
AlloHCT, when successful, can be curative, but also carries the risks
of death and substantial morbidity from chronic graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD). In addition, the initial cost of alloHCT represents a
significant financial burden of approximately $400,000 in the
transplant year.8 This research investigates alloHCT for pediatric
SCD using a comprehensive, systematic database analysis exploring
patient-, disease-, and transplant-related variables that may reduce
healthcare utilization over time while sustaining excellent clinical
outcomes. The findings may provide transplant and non-transplant
physicians with additional information to help choose between
recommending medical therapy and alloHCT.
Methods
Data sources
The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research
(CIBMTR) database contains alloHCT data for recipients and their
donors. Data are collected prior to and at various intervals post-
alloHCT. Upon CIBMTR registration, a weighted randomization


scheme selects a subset of patients for more detailed data collection
in comprehensive research forms (CRF) which provide more specific
transplant-related data (SCD complications, pre-transplant therapy,
etc.) (Online Supplementary Figure A1).
CIBMTR data on all alloHCT recipients are submitted as transplant
essential data (TED) (Online Supplementary Figure A2). TED forms
record donor and recipient demographic, clinical, and transplant
data but lack specific CRF data.
The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS; Children’s Hospital
Association, Overland Park, KS, USA) records the corresponding
inpatient healthcare utilization data. PHIS, a confidential database
of 43 member hospitals in the USA (Online Supplementary Figure
A3), has participating hospitals submit de-identified data with an
encrypted medical record number for identification of readmissions
at the same hospital. Institutional and patient-specific information,
including patient’s age, date of service, visit codes, length of stay
(LOS), adjusted costs, and daily billing data, are collected. The PHIS
has been merged for similar research purposes including a number
of recent scientific publications.9
Merging and validating datasets
Patients in the PHIS database who underwent alloHCT for SCD
during the study period were identified utilizing International
Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD9) and alloHCT diagnosis-
related group (DRG) codes (282.6 and 1803, respectively) as well as
PHIS procedure codes. These patients were identified within the
CIBMTR using a probabilistic algorithm. This process occurred
under the guidance of the CIBMTR via the National Marrow Donor
Program institutional review board.
TED data were merged with PHIS data to determine risk factors and
clinical outcomes associated with healthcare utilization (Online
Supplementary Figure A4). A target of 85% merge accuracy was set
based on the available database population and previously
published reports.119 Once linked, the merge accuracy was
assessed by performing institutional level validation under an
existing pilot institutional review board process.8 This validation


confirmed 100% patient identification in this subset. SCD-related
complications identified in the PHIS were validated against CRF
data, where available, and showed concordance.
Determination of the severity of sickle cell disease
TED/PHIS variables were used to determine SCD severity. Younger
patients (age <10 years) without disease sequelae were considered
low risk. Younger patients with disease sequelae or older patients
(age ≥10 years) without disease sequelae were considered
moderate risk. Older patients with disease sequelae or patients of
any age with stroke were considered high risk. Disease sequelae
were defined as any episode of acute chest syndrome, and/or three
or more vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization in 1 year.12
Variables and outcomes
The study population consisted of children 21 years or younger who
had undergone alloHCT for SCD in the USA between 2000–2013
and for whom CRF data were available. The CRF provided
information on clinical risk factors and outcomes including overall
survival, graft failure, grade II–IV acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, and
GvHD-related event free survival (GREFS). GREFS was defined as
the survival free of graft failure, chronic GvHD, or death and was
used to better assess the post-alloHCT morbidity and associations of
clinical risk factors with outcomes.
The total adjusted cost reported to the PHIS is based on a fixed
hospital-wide ratio of cost to charge adjusted by geographical
location. Adjusted costs for each service unit or department
(clinical, pharmacy, imaging, etc.) were reported using service-
specific ratios of cost to charge. Charges in the PHIS database were
adjusted for the wage and price index (published annually in the
Federal Register) and reported from the hospital perspective. Total
adjusted costs were determined for all inpatient admissions for each
patient and include direct medical costs, excluding provider fees,
incurred. Indirect costs, outpatient costs, and costs incurred at non-
PHIS hospitals were not captured.
Adjusted cost data only were analyzed as the primary outcome of


interest because charges and reimbursements vary across each
institution and state. Patients without available adjusted cost data
were excluded (n=7). Zero-dollar research or study-related costs,
reflecting largely workup, medication, or laboratory-related account
credits, were included in the analysis. Additional healthcare
utilization outcomes included number of admissions and LOS. PHIS
data were used for descriptive analyses of the selected cohort of
patients throughout all the study periods.
Healthcare utilization for the initial alloHCT admission
(conditioning to first recorded discharge) and alloHCT year
(conditioning to day +365) was described and considered
separately in the analyses. Likewise, the pre-alloHCT period (2
years preceding transplant through to the day of transplant
conditioning) and the post-alloHCT period (2 years from day +366
onward) were analyzed separately (Online Supplementary Figure B).
Factors influencing healthcare utilization during the alloHCT year
were analyzed using the following TED clinical variables -age at
transplant, gender, performance status, recipient cytomegalovirus
status, income level, insurance, distance from center, SCD
complications, donor type, graft source, conditioning regimens, and
transplant year. A secondary analysis of disease severity and
healthcare utilization was also performed.
To standardize costs for comparisons, the total adjusted cost per 30
hospital days was calculated for each patient with both pre- and
post-alloHCT inpatient admissions and used as the primary
healthcare utilization outcome. The change in an individual
patient’s healthcare utilization pre- and post-alloHCT was
compared. This change in healthcare utilization was also analyzed
by disease severity.
Statistical analysis
After documenting descriptive statistics, Cox proportional hazards
modeling of CRF level data determined the impact of risk factors on
alloHCT outcomes. Due to low event rates and small sample sizes,
only bivariate analyses involving one explanatory variable at a time
were performed. The cumulative incidences of acute GvHD and


chronic GvHD were calculated using a competing risk framework.
TED/PHIS data were evaluated to identify whether demographic
factors, SCD severity, or alloHCT variables correlate with healthcare
utilization changes during the alloHCT year using Wilcoxon,
Kruskal-Wallis, or linear trend tests. Healthcare utilization pre- and
post-alloHCT was compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for
continuous variables and the McNemar test for binary variables.
Finally, the impact of SCD severity on healthcare utilization across
these two time periods was examined by Poisson regression for
number of visits and LOS. Total adjusted cost were analyzed by
linear regression. All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.3 statistical software (Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Outcomes analysis
CRF data were available for 161 patients with a median age of 10
years (range <1–21) of whom 50% were female (Table 1; Online
Supplementary Table A). The majority (84%) of patients had the
HbSS genotype. The most commonly documented transplant
indication was stroke (29%) followed by recurrent vaso-occlusive
crises (22%). However, 39% had stroke as a documented SCD
complication, 55% vaso-occlusive crises, and 53% acute chest
syndrome. The majority of patients reported use of medical therapy,
hydroxyurea (45%) and chronic transfusions (64%). The most
common source of a graft for transplantation was a matched sibling
donor (MSD) (42%) and the majority of patients received
myeloablative conditioning (60%).

Table 1.Characteristics of USA pediatric patients (age ≤21)
receiving first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell
disease.
The 2-year overall survival was 90% [95% confidence interval (CI):
85–95%]: 96% (95% CI: 89–100%) for cord blood transplant (CBT),


94% (95% CI: 86–98%) for MSD transplants, and 74% (95% CI: 54–
90%) for transplants from well-matched unrelated donors (MUD)
(P=0.002) (Online Supplementary Table B and Online Supplementary
Figure C). All 16 deaths occurred among children with pre-alloHCT
complications of SCD and were due to organ failure (37.5%),
infections (25%), GvHD (6.2%), and other/unknown causes (31.2%)
(Online Supplementary Table C). The majority of deaths (62.5%)
occurred during the alloHCT year; six patients died after day +365
(2 from organ failure, 1 from infection, 1 from sickle cell-associated
vasculopathy, and 2 from a missing/other unspecified cause).
The cumulative incidence of acute GvHD at day 100 was 14% (95%
CI: 9–20%), and chronic GvHD developed in 31% (95% CI: 23–
38%) at 2 years. Of those with chronic GvHD, 64% had extensive
disease with over half having a MSD (n=9) or MUD (n=11). The 2-
year GREFS was 64% (95% CI: 56–71%).
Age ≥10 years and use of a MUD showed significant negative
associations with outcomes (Table 2). The use of cyclosporine-A
prophylaxis and year of alloHCT exhibited significant associations
with chronic GvHD-related outcomes (Table 2).

transplant-related variables as reported in CRF data (n=161).
Healthcare utilization analysis
Combined TED/PHIS data were available for 183 patients with a
median age of 9 years (range: <1–20) of whom 45% were female
(Table 1). With regards to SCD complications, 73% had vaso-
occlusive crises, 25% had acute chest syndrome, and 16% had a
stroke prior to alloHCT. This translated into 19.7% with low
severity disease, 36.6% with moderate severity, and 43.7% with
high severity disease (Online Supplementary Table D). The majority
of patients received MSD alloHCT (69%) and a myeloablative
regimen (66%). Complete cost data were available for 176 of the
183 patients.


The median total adjusted cost per patient was $380,320
[interquartile range (IQR): $297,710–$563,462] with a median LOS
of 39.5 days (IQR: 31–53) (Table 3). The highest costs were
associated with room and nursing charges followed by pharmacy
costs (Online Supplementary Figure D).
[image]
Table 3.Inpatient healthcare utilization analysis as reported over
time in the PHIS.
The median total adjusted cost per patient was $467,747 (IQR:
$344,029–$799,219) with a median LOS of 52 days (IQR: 38–72)
(Table 3). Again, the highest costs were associated with room and
nursing charges followed by pharmacy costs (Online Supplementary
Figure D).
During the alloHCT year, age ≥10 years and total adjusted cost per
30 days were not significantly associated (P=0.775) (Table 4).
Total adjusted cost was also not associated with income level,
insurance type, or distance from transplant center (P=0.417, 0.918,
and 0.253, respectively). The total adjusted cost per 30 days was
lower for MSD transplants than for CBT or MUD transplants
(P<0.001). CBT was associated with a higher total adjusted cost
per 30 days compared to bone marrow transplants (P=0.004).
Increased total adjusted cost per 30 days were associated with prior
stroke (P=0.004) and vaso-occlusive crises (P=0.009) but not
acute chest syndrome (P=0.291). Overall, total adjusted cost per 30
days increased with SCD severity (P=0.022).
[image]
Table 4.Comparison of inpatient total adjusted costs per 30 days by
TED/PHIS patient and transplant variables during the alloHCT year
(n=176).
Two-year inpatient healthcare utilization data were available for
134 pre-alloHCT patients and 45 post-alloHCT. The median total
adjusted cost per patient was $56,416 (IQR: $32,848–$103,270)


pre-alloHCT; this decreased to $33,112 (IQR: $14,291–$161,959)
post-alloHCT (Table 3). The highest adjusted costs during these
periods were associated with room and nursing charges followed by
laboratory costs (Online Supplementary Figure D).
Only 41 patients were admitted to the hospital during both pre- and
post-transplant periods: healthcare utilization was significantly
reduced with total adjusted cost per 30 days decreasing from
$9,393 (IQR: $4,595–$31,291) to $1,873 (IQR: $571–$6,504)
(P=0.008) (Figure 1). Of these, 30 patients had high severity
disease and had a significant reduction in healthcare utilization
(admissions P<0.001, LOS P<0.001, cost P=0.002) (Online
Supplementary Table E).

Discussion
Substantial advances in alloHCT for SCD have been made in the
past two decades; nevertheless, the eligibility of patients, especially
those without severe disease, remains controversial. This study
provides additional insight into eligibility as alloHCT outcomes
were favorably linked to age and donor type suggesting that early
alloHCT, before the age of 10 years, and MSD alloHCT have optimal
outcomes with the latter also showing a significant healthcare
utilization advantage. These outcomes are in keeping with a recent
report from an international study of adult and pediatric MSD
recipients describing lower event-free survival rates with increasing
age at transplantation and support the recent expert panel
recommendation of early alloHCT, prior to the onset of SCD


complications, for children with SCD and an available MSD.1413
MSD alloHCT is not, however, a viable option for many patients, as
fewer than 25% will have a suitable HLA-matched donor,
necessitating MUD alloHCT for severe disease. Among patients
undergoing MUD alloHCT, higher GvHD risk could be hypothesized
as the etiology of poorer outcomes and increased healthcare
utilization of older recipients.171513 Although the GvHD-related
mortality rate in this study is lower than that in published reports,
the low percentage of deaths after day +365 may mitigate the
mortality associated with chronic GvHD. However, the 26%
mortality among the MUD alloHCT patients remains well over the
5% mortality threshold accepted by most parents and adolescents
for the cure of SCD, as recently published.18 Efforts are still needed
to elucidate more precisely the cause of death (unknown cause in
31%) and transplant-related mortality, especially among patients
who died after the alloHCT year, in order to improve transplant
procedures to prevent these complications. Our findings support the
current practice of restricting MUD alloHCT to individuals with
severe disease.19
The results of the analysis of donor type were consistent with
published reports and indicated that the overall survival of patients
treated with CBT is similar to that of recipients of MSD bone
marrow; however, healthcare utilization was higher with CBT.20
Many of the drawbacks of CBT have been associated with
insufficient cell dose. Ongoing research into cord blood expansion
may mitigate this limitation and the associated healthcare
utilization by reducing the delay in engraftment.2321 However, this
cohort of both related and unrelated CBT showed no statistical
difference in GREFS or other GvHD outcomes, with a lower cost
compared to MUD, suggesting that more analysis is needed to
determine the optimal donor type if a MSD is unavailable.
Donor type and SCD severity had a significant impact on both
outcomes and healthcare utilization, such that patients with high
severity disease and MUD had poorer outcomes and increased
healthcare utilization. The correlation of healthcare utilization and
disease severity, not age, is unclear but may suggest that healthcare
utilization is linked to management of persistent SCD complications


after alloHCT. Although some end-organ disease is reversible after
alloHCT, complications of chronic lung disease and pain can persist
in the first year post-alloHCT.24 These complications correlate with
increased healthcare utilization in individuals with SCD.25 In
addition, severe disease remains an indication for MUD alloHCT
research trials suggesting this as a possible confounder in healthcare
utilization analysis. MUD outcomes associated with degree of HLA
matching, supportive care measures, and infection must also be
considered in more detail.16 Understanding and mitigating risk
factors associated with poor outcomes and increased healthcare
utilization following MUD alloHCT is needed because improvements
in unrelated alloHCT clinical outcomes have the potential to have
the greatest clinical and financial impact.
The healthcare utilization analysis also described variations over
time with a subset of patients having a significant reduction in
healthcare utilization pre- and post-alloHCT. However, the current
sample size and/or 2-year time period may not be sufficient to
document a change in inpatient healthcare utilization for the entire
population of patients. Donor type variations (e.g., CBT) and
disease severity within our small sample size likely have a role;
more robust analysis is ongoing to understand this phenomenon
better. In addition, outpatient healthcare utilization was not
described which may account for the substantial reduction of data
available for pre- and post-alloHCT analysis. However, previous
publications on healthcare utilization in this population indicated
that outpatient costs remained flat pre- and post-alloHCT.8
Limitations
This is a retrospective study and analysis is therefore limited to
variables and data collected by the CIBMTR at the time of alloHCT.
This limitation is somewhat mitigated by using multiple sources of
data (PHIS and CIBMTR, both TED and CRF forms) to increase
sample size and data availability or quality. Retrospective studies
also do not allow control of exposures (pre-alloHCT treatment,
conditioning, etc.) which may influence outcomes. Bivariate and
multivariate analyses can elucidate cofounders; however, due to
sample size and low event rates, multivariate analysis was not
performed in this study. However, univariate analysis was used to


document the impact of these exposures on outcomes.
The retrospective nature of this database study also does not allow
for comparison to controls with SCD who have not been
transplanted or incorporation of prospective metrics including
quality of life in the analysis. Previous studies have documented the
quality of life improvements gained after alloHCT for SCD.2726
Other studies have described significant quality of life differences
between non-transplant interventions such as chronic transfusion
and hydroxyurea.281 Outcomes and cost of care for children have
been well documented, with a recent analysis of management with
hydroxyurea based on Medicaid claims data suggesting that lifetime
costs of care may be influenced by the age of hydroxyurea
initiation.295 These data largely demonstrate the substantial
lifetime costs associated with caring for individuals with SCD and
the need to compare costs across the various available treatment
options.6 Collectively these findings suggest a multicenter case
control study incorporating quality of life is needed to truly
understand the full impact of alloHCT on outcomes and healthcare
utilization. Prospective studies, including STRIDE2 (NCT02766465),
are underway to fill this gap in knowledge of alloHCT for SCD.
The study includes a population that is heterogeneous for donor
type, graft source, and conditioning regimen. Analysis of this
complex group reflects the current clinical paradigm and its
potential to influence healthcare utilization; however, diversity does
introduce confounders. A recent study showed that conditioning
regimen does not influence outcomes, and graft source only
influences overall survival, while age and year of transplant
influence both overall and event-free survival.13 Survival outcomes
of this cohort are similar to this and other previously published
estimates; these findings suggest that the heterogeneity of our
cohort had limited influence on the outcomes analysis.
The study focuses on a pediatric population which is unique in that
children are largely less affected by the disease than their adult
counterparts and alloHCT has quite a different long-term impact.
Certainly, efforts to offer early MSD alloHCT will have a significant
effect on adult care; in the meantime, a large number of adults live
with SCD. Therefore, efforts to better understand the cost of “late


alloHCT” are needed. Specifically, the combination of favorable
outcomes of CBT and advances in cord blood expansion technology
may make this a more viable option for adults.2321 Although, this
study excluded data on haploidentical transplants, promising
clinical outcomes to date suggest this is as another viable means of
expanding the donor pool for adults and children with SCD.24
Ultimately, as the field advances with changes in conditioning
regimens, modified donor source options, and the advent of gene
therapy, ongoing analysis of outcomes and cost will be needed.
Studies of alloHCT for SCD are also limited by the absence of
sufficient data on late effects. The risk of impaired fertility and
long-term quality of life are not well described. Many studies have
documented the impact of alloHCT on sperm production and
ovarian failure in this population, but the actual fertility risk
remains unclear particularly in light of the use of newer reduced
intensity regimens that are less gonadotoxic.30173 However, a
recent study of patients’ and parents’ attitudes toward alloHCT
documented that 56% were willing to accept infertility18
suggesting the potential for cure may far outweigh the risk of this
complication. At the same time, another recent study of alloHCT
not only reported the impact on fertility but also on sexual function
and other patient-reported outcomes. In a cohort of individuals
studied at least 10 years after transplantation for malignant disease,
reports of sexual problems, restrictions in social function, memory
and attention concerns, denial of life and health insurance were
significant.31 Future studies should determine late outcomes after
transplantation for SCD, collecting data not only on end-organ
complications but also patient-reported outcomes including organ
function and quality of life evaluations for both alloHCT recipients
and controls.
Finally, this study involved a USA population and its findings
cannot be easily extrapolated to a global population. However,
recent publications have documented the impact of alloHCT
throughout the developing world. AlloHCT outcomes in India and
Mexico have been described as nearly equivalent to those in the
developed world but are performed at substantially lower
costs.3332 International experience suggests that further study of
USA transplant approaches to learn potential cost efficiencies from


the global experience will make alloHCT more viable for SCD and
other diseases throughout the world.
Conclusion
Performing analyses of both clinical and financial outcomes is
challenging because of the lack of a single, exhaustive data source.
The data merging process is invaluable in that it successfully
utilizes existing datasets and combines them to create the largest
and most accurate surrogate for assessment in a comprehensive
manner. This provides proof of principle for this methodology and
type of analysis and builds a foundation for future research in the
field. Specifically, the superior clinical outcomes among children
<10 years old lay the basis for prospective studies among low-risk
SCD patients for whom a MSD is available. In addition, alloHCT,
although costly, can provide a sustained decrease in healthcare
utilization for patients over time. These results and future studies
will provide guidance and insight into health policy determinations
for the optimal use of this curative therapy for children with SCD.
