The molecular basis of endothelial cell plasticity
Elisabetta Dejana1,2,*,w, Karen K. Hirschi3,* & Michael Simons4,*
The endothelium is capable of remarkable plasticity. In the embryo, primitive endothelial cells
differentiate to acquire arterial, venous or lymphatic fates. Certain endothelial cells also
undergo hematopoietic transition giving rise to multi-lineage hematopoietic stem and
progenitors while others acquire mesenchymal properties necessary for heart development.
In the adult, maintenance of differentiated endothelial state is an active process requiring
constant signalling input. The failure to do so leads to the development of endothelial-to￾mesenchymal transition that plays an important role in pathogenesis of a number of diseases.
A better understanding of these phenotypic changes may lead to development of new
therapeutic interventions.
Endothelial cells, that form the early vascular plexus during embryo development, progress
through a number of fate transitions until they achieve their highly differentiated adult
state. At early stages of embryonic development, cells that will form the primitive
vasculature exhibit a primordial, non-specialized endothelial phenotype. As the plexus is
remodelled into specialized vascular structures, these primitive endothelial cells acquire
specialized characteristics typical of arteries, veins or lymphatics. Subsequently, during organ
vascularization, the endothelial cells differentiate further to adapt to the specific needs of the
organ1.
In this review, we discuss key emerging concepts and challenges in the rapidly moving field of
endothelial fate transition, including signalling pathways implicated in endothelial-to￾hematopoietic cell transition (EHT) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), as
well as physiological and pathological implications of these processes.
Endothelial cell development and fate transitions during embryogenesis
The vasculature is among the first organ systems to develop during embryogenesis, and is
essential for the growth, survival and function of all other organ systems. Blood vessels are
composed of endothelial cells that form the inner, luminal layer and smooth muscle cells that
form the surrounding vessel wall. During blood vessel development, endothelial cells are formed
first, and undergo rapid expansion and coalescence into capillary plexi that are then remodeled
into a circulatory network. Vascular remodelling and maturation involves coordinated
migration, growth control and specification of arterial and venous endothelial subtypes, as
well as smooth muscle cell recruitment.

As the vasculature is established within distinct organs, the
endothelium therein is further phenotypically specialized to meet
the needs of the tissue. For example, in the brain and retina, tight
junctions are formed to create a barrier against infiltration of
circulating factors and cells. In contrast, in tissues with filtration
functions, such as the kidney and liver, the endothelium can be
discontinuous and develop fenestrae to promote infiltration and
extravasation of circulating factors.
Vascular endothelium also significantly contributes to the
development of other organ systems, including blood and the
heart. In these circumstances, endothelial cells undergo a fate
transition into another cell type; that is, hematopoietic cells, or
cardiac mesenchyme, respectively. The differentiation, specializa￾tion and fate transitions of endothelium during development are
discussed herein.
Endothelial cell differentiation. The emergence of primordial
(non-specialized) endothelial cells is referred to as vasculogenesis
and begins in the developing mammal shortly after gastrulation
in the extraembryonic yolk sac. Endothelial cells are formed from
mesodermal progenitors in response to signals from the adjacent
visceral endoderm and coalescence into vascular plexi that
are remodeled into circulatory networks during the process of
angiogenesis.
Genetic manipulation studies in the mouse revealed that
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2 or bFGF) and bone morpho￾genetic protein 4 (BMP4) are not only critical for mesoderm
formation, but also play an important role in endothelial
cell differentiation.2 Indian hedgehog (IHH) signalling,
likely mediated via BMP4 (ref. 3) also promotes endothelial cell
development, and is sufficient to induce the formation of
endothelial cells in mouse embryo explants that lack
endoderm2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) is
another key regulator of vasculogenesis. It predominantly binds
two receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt-1), which acts as a sink for bioactive
VEGF-A, and VEGFR2 (Flk-1 or Kdr), which is required for
vascular plexus development4. VEGFR2  /  mouse embryonic
stem cells generate endothelial cells, although they fail to
propagate in vitro. Thus, VEGF-A may regulate the survival
and/or propagation of endothelial cells, but not their fate
specification.
Transcriptional regulators in the ETS family are known to play
an important role in endothelial cell development, and the
regulatory regions for almost all endothelial genes contain ETS
binding sites5,6. ETS variant 2 (Etv2 or ER71/etsrp), in particular,
regulates the differentiation of mesodermal progenitors toward an
endothelial cell fate. It is restricted to VEGFR2-expressing
mesodermal progenitors, and mice deficient in Etv2 lack a yolk
sac vascular plexus, dorsal aortae and endocardium, despite
normal mesoderm formation7. Overexpression of Etv2 in vivo
leads to ectopic expression of endothelial-specific genes,
suggesting it is necessary and sufficient for endothelial cell
development7. FGF signalling is known to promote Ets-driven
gene expression8, although we have much to learn about the
coordination among signalling pathways and transcriptional
regulators that mediate endothelial cell differentiation.
Endothelial cell specialization. Once formed, primordial vascu￾lature undergoes further differentiation and specialization,
resulting in formation of distinct arterial, venous and lymphatic
systems. Signalling pathways implicated in early endothelial cell
development are also thought to play significant roles in arterial￾venous specification. For example, during arterial-venous speci￾fication, VEGF-A binds to VEGFR2 and co-receptor neuropilin-1
(Nrp1), leading to activation of Notch signalling. Arterial-specific
genes, including EphrinB2, are upregulated downstream of
Notch signalling; whereas, venous-specific EphB4 expression is
suppressed9. Inhibition of Notch signalling results in an arterial￾to-venous fate switch10. Wnt signalling is also involved in the
specification of arterial endothelial cells; b-catenin, a trans￾criptional co-activator of Wnt signalling pathway, upregulates
Notch ligand Dll4 and promotes arterial specification11. In
addition, Hedgehog acts upstream of VEGF-A via smoothened
receptor to drive arterial endothelial cell specification and repress
venous fate12,13. Venous endothelial cell specification is induced
by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II
(COUP-TFII). Endothelial-specific deletion of COUP-TFII leads
to arterialization of veins, whereas ectopic expression results in
fusion of veins and arteries14. Lymphatic endothelial cells are
formed, in part, from a subset of endothelium within the cardinal
vein; wherein, the co-expression of COUP-TF II and SOX18
leads to upregulation of PROX-1 that promotes lymphatic
specification. The propagation of lymphatic endothelial cells is
mediated by VEGFR3 signalling, driven by VEGF-C from the
surrounding mesenchyme. Importantly, further stabilization and
quiescence of the lymphatic system is mediated by FOXC2
and fluid shear stress, providing an essential link between
biomechanical forces and endothelial cell identity15.
Transition of endothelial cells to hematopoietic cells. As arterial
and venous endothelial cells are being specified within the yolk
sac, another type of endothelial cell is also developing. These are
hemogenic endothelial cells that will give rise to multi-lineage
hematopoietic progenitors through a process referred to as EHT.
Hemogenic endothelial cells also form in other tissues throughout
the course of gestation, including the placenta and umbilical
vessels, as well as within the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesene￾phros (AGM) region where they give rise to hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC)16. Other tissues observed to give rise to hematopoietic
cells during development include the head vasculature17 and the
endocardium 18.
The process of blood production from the endothelium
appears to require two distinct steps: hemogenic endothelial cell
specification and EHT (depicted in Fig. 1). The initial specifica￾tion of hemogenic endothelial cells involves some of the same
signalling pathways implicated in arterial-venous specification,

endothelial cells is specified to become hemogenic (dark red), and these
cells give rise to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) via EHT.
The specification of hemogenic endothelial cells requires retinoic acid (RA)
signalling, which leads to upregulation of c-Kit. Notch is activated
downstream of c-Kit expression and controls endothelial cell cycle to
enable hemogenic specification via mechanisms that are still unclear. The
subsequent generation of HSPC requires transcription factor Runx1, and
binding partners Gata, Ets, Scl and Lmo-2. Other factors involved in this
process include Wnt/b-catenin, Sox17 and Notch, whose molecular roles
and interactions are under study.

although it appears to be uniquely initiated by retinoic acid (RA)
signalling. During vasculogenesis in the murine yolk sac, the
first site of hemogenic endothelial cell specification, active
RA is generated by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2).
Raldh2  /  mutant embryos exhibit endothelial cell hyperpro￾liferation, lack vascular remodeling and hemogenic endothelial
cell development and die mid-gestation19. RA signalling is also
critical for the development of hemogenic endothelial cells within
the AGM20. In both tissues,B90% of endothelial cells with active
RA signalling exhibit a hemogenic phenotype, and B90%
of hemogenic endothelial cells are undergoing active RA
signalling2,20.
Signalling pathways that function downstream of RA in this
process include c-Kit and Notch. c-Kit (CD117) is a receptor with
tyrosine kinase activity that binds stem cell factor; its expression
is a distinguishing feature of hemogenic endothelial cells, relative
to non-blood forming endothelial cells19. c-Kit is known to be
transcriptionally regulated by RA signalling, and re-expression of
c-Kit in Raldh2  /  mutants rescues hemogenic endothelial cell
development and definitive hematopoiesis21.
Notch1 expression in endothelial cells is upregulated down￾stream of c-Kit21, and is essential for hemogenic endothelial
specification, just as it is for arterial22 and lymphatic specifi￾cation23. Notch signalling is involved in cell-fate decisions and
cell differentiation, and embryos lacking Notch1, or Notch1 and
Notch4, the only Notch receptors expressed by endothelial cells,
exhibit abnormal vascular remodeling similar to Raldh2  / 
mutants24. Notch1, specifically, is expressed in the ventral wall of
the dorsal aorta where hemogenic endothelium forms25 and the
AGM of Notch1  /  mutants exhibit decreased hematopoietic
activity. Collectively, these data suggest that Notch signalling is
important in hemogenic endothelial cell development; however,
much needs to be learned about the role of Notch signalling in
EHT. Some studies suggest Notch ligand distribution dictates
the outcome of Notch signalling during definitive hematopoiesis
in the AGM. That is, hemogenic specification is driven by
low levels of Jag1-mediated Notch signalling. In the absence of
Jag1, Dll4-mediated high Notch activity instead drives arterial
specification26.
The formation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPC) from the endothelium has been most intensely studied in
the AGM region. Therein, intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters
are formed from hemogenic endothelial cells during EHT. The
clusters are composed of pre-HSC that differentially express
endothelial and hematopoietic markers including VE-cadherin
c-Kit, Ly6a (Sca-1), CD41 and CD45, suggesting that a post￾hemogenic endothelial cell intermediate may exist along the
transition from endothelial cell to HSPC within these struc￾tures27–29. The dorsoventral polarity of the clusters emergence
is thought to be guided by mesenchymally derived pro￾hematopoietic ventralizing (VEGF, FGF2, TGFb, BMP4) or
anti-hematopoietic dorsalizing (EGF and TGFa) factors, which
affect the expression of critical hematopoietic transcription
factors involved in EHT (ref. 30).
One such essential transcriptional regulator of EHT is Runx1
(AML1), a member of a family of transcription factors called core
binding factors31. Runx1 is thought to repress the endothelial
program, while activating the hematopoietic program during the
EHT process27,29. Deletion of Runx1 does not prevent hemogenic
endothelial cell specification, but prevents the transition of these
cells to CD41 þ CD45 þ hematopoietic cells32. The transition
from endothelial to hematopoietic phenotype is in part controlled
by binding of multiprotein complexes containing GATA,
Ets33, and SCL factors to Runx1 enhancers that promotes HSC
emergence34, as well as the loss of expression of genes associated
with arterial identity35, at least within the AGM.
There is further evidence that Notch and Wnt pathways
interact to generate HSC in the zebrafish embryo and also are
involved in driving hematopoietic development from embryonic
stem cells36,37. Wnt/b-catenin activity is transiently required in
the AGM for emergence and generation of long-term HSC, as
well as production of hematopoietic cells in vitro from AGM
endothelial precursors37. Downstream of Wnt signalling in the
AGM, is expression of transcription factor Sox17. Conditional
loss of Sox17 in endothelial cells in the AGM leads to increased
production of hematopoietic cells35, suggesting that Sox17
modulates the fate of hemogenic endothelium by actively
repressing the hematopoietic program. Other studies show that
enforced expression of Sox17 in mouse embryonic stem cells
leads to increased blood-forming endothelial cells that generate T
lymphocytes, through a mechanism involving Notch signalling38.
Thus, more work is needed to understand the roles and
interactions among these regulators of EHT.
Other factors, including inflammatory39–42 and G-protein
coupled receptor signalling43,44, purine signalling45 and chro￾matin remodeling46,47 are also involved in promoting EHT, and
their coordination with known regulators of this process are
under investigation.
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in development. In
addition to vascular endothelial cells within hematopoietic tissues
undergoing EHT and giving rise to hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells, the specialized endothelial cells that line the
heart (endocardial cells) also undergo EndMT, and give rise to
mesenchymal cells necessary for proper heart development.
Although all cells in the heart arise from one or more epithelial￾to-mesenchymal transition, EndMT, specifically, generates valve
progenitor cells that give rise to the mitral and tricuspid valves.
EndMT also contributes to endocardial cushion formation, as
well as to generation of cardiac fibroblasts and smooth muscle
cells, but not cardiac myocytes.
These developmental mechanisms may well be recapitulated in
adult valve disease, in cardiac fibrosis, and in myocardial
responses to ischemic injury (see below). Thus, understanding
what regulates EndMT during embryogenesis may provide
insights needed to treat postnatal pathologies. In addition, since
some of the signalling pathways that regulate developmental
EndMT (TGFb, BMP, Notch, Wnt/b-catenin)48 also play a role in
EHT (Fig. 1), as well as postnatal EndMT (discussed in detail in
subsequent sections), comparing these regulatory pathways may
reveal common targets for therapy.
Maintenance of adult endothelial homeostasis
The enormous phenotypic plasticity exhibited by endothelial cells
is a direct reflection of their exposure to the environment full of
growth factors, cytokines, rich in oxygen and mechanical stresses.
It is not surprising, therefore, that maintenance of endothelial
normalcy is an active processes requiring constant energy
expenditure and signalling input. While still poorly understood,
recent studies shed light on several active endothelial ‘main￾tenance’ pathways. These include regulation of expression of key
proteins such as VEGFR2 and FGFR1, maintenance of endothe￾lial barrier function, suppression of apoptosis and prevention of
the fate drift.
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play a particularly important
role in control of endothelial homeostasis. Even a transient
withdrawal of the FGF signalling input leads to a progressive loss
of endothelial cell-cell contacts, increased permeability and,
eventually, compromise of vascular integrity8,49,50 while a more
prolonged withdrawal leads to endothelial apoptosis51 and
vascular rarefication52 including the loss of vasa vasorum53. In

part, these changes are due to increased VE-cadherin phospho￾rylation at Y658 (and thus the loss of VE-cadherin-p120-catenin
association that impairs adherence junctions), and in part to a
decline in VEGFR2 levels (thereby increasing endothelial
apoptosis). The former is a consequence of a decrease in FGF￾dependent expression of the phosphatase Shp2 (ref. 54) while the
latter is due to the requirement for the FGF-driven Ets/FOXC2
VEGFR2 transcription8. Since both VE-cadherin phospho￾rylation and VEGFR2 turnover are rapidly occurring processes,
withdrawal of a continuous FGF signalling input rapidly leads to
the above-described consequences55.
Another key role played by the FGF signalling input is
maintenance of the endothelial cell fate. FGFs achieve this by
blocking activation of TGFb signalling cascade that is central to
the induction of EndMT transition both in blood56,57 and
lymphatic endothelial cells58 that is discussed below. Endothelial
homeostasis is also maintained by VE-cadherin that is the cell
specific major organizer of endothelial cell-to-cell adherens
junctions59,60. The expression and clustering of VE-cadherin at
cell–cell junctions not only maintains endothelial cell-to-cell
adhesion but, through the interaction with a complex network
of intracellular partners, transduces intracellular signals that
mediate contact inhibition of cell growth, cell polarity and lumen
formation. Therefore, conditions that disrupt endothelial
junctions not only induce increase in vascular permeability by
opening intercellular gaps but also change the endothelial cell
responses to their environment and to the surrounding cells. For
instance, when VE-cadherin junction organization is dismantled,
gene transcription of endothelial cells is strongly modified, the
cells tend to grow in multiple layers, are unable to form a correct
vascular lumen and establish adhesion contacts with the
surrounding pericytes and smooth muscle cells61–63.
At the molecular level, VE-cadherin is linked through its
cytoplasmic domain to p120 catenin, b-catenin and plakoglobin.
Furthermore, it can interact and modulate signalling of several
growth factor receptors to promote contact inhibition of cell
growth. For instance, VE-cadherin expression and clustering
inhibits VEGFR2 and FGFR1 signalling while increases TGFbR
complex organization and signalling64–66. Some phosphatases
(VE-PTP, DEP-1, PTPu, Csk and SHP2)61,67,68 and
kinases (such as Src or FAK)69–71 may also associate with the
VE-cadherin complex and modulate cell signalling. This complex
signalling system is dynamic and continuously adapting to
different external conditions (shear stress, growth stimulation,
increase in permeability) to maintain endothelial integrity72.
Definition and occurrence of EndMT in various pathologies
In the absence of active input endothelial cells may either die or
undergo EndMT, a process with certain similarities with the
better understood epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Just as
occurs during normal development, during postnatal EndMT,
endothelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics such as an
elongated, fibroblastoid morphology, increased motility, cytoske￾letal modifications and cell-to-cell junction rearrangement.
However, in the adult, they further become proliferative,
thrombogenic and deposit large amounts of extracellular matrix.
EndMT may lead to endothelial cells acquiring a variety
of different mesenchymal fates (Fig. 2). As the result of this
transformation, endothelial cells undergo a profound phenotypic
change assuming the shape and properties of mesenchymal cells
(fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells), including secretion of extra￾cellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and collagen, and
expression of various leukocyte adhesion molecules. (see Fig. 3
reporting the list of specific markers)
At the cellular level, EndMT consequences include altered
endothelial cell junction organization, loss of cell polarity, and
increased cell proliferation and migratory capacity73. This results
in a number of pathological consequences of considerable
clinical significance in diseases ranging from cavernous cerebral
malformations (CCM)74 to tissue fibrosis75–77, heterotopic
ossification78,79, neointima formation56,80–82, atherosclerosis81
and cancer83,84.
The recognition of EndMT in tissues relies on detection of cells
expressing both mesenchymal and endothelial markers. However,
this approach assumes that cells that have undergone EndMT
retain endothelial marker expression. While this is likely to be
true immediately after the EndMT switch, at later stages

endothelial cells may lose their endothelial markers (Fig. 3).
Therefore, any immunocytochemical assessment of EndMT is an
underestimate of the true frequency of this phenomenon. In
addition, EndMT frequency varies depending on location and
type of endothelial cells undergoing this process. Thus, in
transplant settings, over 80% of luminal endothelial cells express
mesenchymal markers while the frequency of this phenomenon
elsewhere (for example, in the neointima) is much less56,80.
Similarly, endothelial cells overlying the atherosclerotic plaque
have a much higher EndMT incidence than nearby cells not in
direct contact with the plaque81.
Fate-mapping has been employed to assess the true frequency
of this phenomenon. For obvious reasons, however, this is
possible in mice but not in clinical specimens. Fate-mapping
involves activation of endothelial expression of a marker gene
(typically LacZ) in adult mice using a tissue-specific Cre. Cdh5-
CreERT2 is the most common driver line used for these studies85.
It reaches high, but not 100% efficiency in most, but not all,
endothelial beds so even this approach does not provide full
assessment of EndMT frequency.
EndMT in atherosclerosis and transplant arteriopathy. Recent
studies documented EndMT contribution to vascular pathology
both in transplant arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis lesions.
Both diseases are characterized by the growth of neointima that is
composed of a mixture of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts,
mononuclear inflammatory and immune cells and extracellular
matrix. In both cases chronic vascular inflammation, induced by
certain immune mismatches in the case of transplant arterio￾pathy86 and lipid deposition and mechanical forces in the case of
atherosclerosis87,88, are thought to play a central role in disease
progression. EndMT has been detected in both conditions and
likely plays a critical role in progression of both disease states.
Fate mapping using Cdh5Cre;mTmG fate mice in a
mouse acute transplant rejection model showed that B10% of
neointimal smooth muscle cells were of endothelial origin 2
weeks after transplant. At the same time, B80% of neointimal
and B60% of luminal endothelial cells expressed mesenchymal
markers indicating EndMT56,80. In agreement with these data,
examination of patient samples from explanted rejected hearts
found that B80% of coronary artery luminal endothelial and
neointima cells were undergoing EndMT56,80.
Studies in other vascular injury models revealed a lower
incidence of EndMT: 5% of neointimal SMC were of endothelial
origin in the mouse wire injury model and 7% in vein-to-artery
(inferior vena cava to aorta) graft model. Interestingly, in the
latter case the incidence of EndMT increased from 3% at 2 weeks
after grafting to 7% 4 weeks later, indicating that it is an ongoing
process56,80. A study utilizing a somewhat different vein graft
model (jugular vein to femoral artery) reported still higher
incidence of EndMT: 28 to 50% at 5 weeks82. Similarly high
incidence of EndMT has been observed in a mouse model using
tissue-engineered vascular grafts. Here, EndMT frequency varied
from 38 to 51% in occluded grafts (severe rejection) to 17% in
patent grafts (less severe rejection)89. These variations in the
observed EndMT extent likely relate to the severity of injury, the
magnitude of the inflammatory response and differences in
hemodynamic stress.
EndMT is equally prevalent in atherosclerosis, a progressive
disease initiated by lipid deposition in parts of the arterial tree
subjected to disturbed blood flow and is characterized by the
gradual build-up of intraluminal plaques leading to reduction in
distal tissue perfusion88. Some of the plaques are prone to
rupture, an event than can lead to thrombosis and sudden
death90. Chronic inflammation is thought to play a particularly
important role in the disease progression although molecular
details remain poorly understood86,88,91.
Examination of fate-mapped Apoe  /  mice revealed that after
four months of high fat diet B30% of luminal aortic endothelial
cells were undergoing EndMT while no EndMT was detected in
animals on the normal diet81. Similarly, examination of
atherosclerotic plaques showed that about 35% of fibroblasts
and ‘‘mesenchymal’’ cells were of endothelial origin92. Exami￾nation of human atherosclerotic vessels using immuno￾cytochemical techniques, confirmed frequent occurrence of

EndMT in coronary atherosclerosis81,92 and in carotid artery
plaques93. Critically, there is a strong correlation (r ¼ 0.84)
between the anatomically determined severity of coronary artery
disease and the extent of EndMT in luminal endothelial cells81,92
in human coronary arteries.
One of the hallmarks of EndMT is activation of TGFb
signalling that, in turn, has been implicated in regulation of
endothelial plasticity92,94. Indeed, in human coronary specimens
there is a strong correlation between the extent of EndMT and the
extent of activation of endothelial TGFb signalling program81.
The latter may directly contribute to atherosclerotic plaque
growth as stimulation of EndMT increases atherosclerotic burden
in Apoe  /  mice81 and leads to formation of more unstable
lesions characterized by larger necrotic cores and small fibrous
caps81,92. However, the genetic/therapeutic proof of endothelial
TGFb signalling in atherosclerosis progression and regression is
still absent.
EndMT in cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac fibrosis, deposition of
collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins in the
myocardium play an important role in pathogenesis of a number
of diseases from hypertension to coronary disease to various
pressure- and volume-overload conditions. At the whole organ
level, cardiac fibrosis leads to impaired chamber relaxation and
may, eventually, result in reduction of cardiac output. Despite
their obvious pathophysiologic importance, the origin of cardiac
fibroblasts remains controversial in part because of the difficulty
of accurately identifying cardiac fibroblasts using antibodies.
Indeed, a number of ‘‘fibroblast’’ markers including fibroblast￾specific protein 1 (FSP1), Thy1, vimentin and discoidin domain
receptor family member 2 are expressed by other cell types
including immune cells95. It is likely that a number of different
populations are present that may not express a common antigen.
An early study that used Tie1Cre fate mapping suggested that
EndMT may contribute significantly to cardiac fibrosis after
myocardial infarction by increasing cardiac fibroblast popula￾tion75. However, the employed approach did not distinguish
between the expansion of a pre-existing Tie1 þ population of
fibroblasts vs. EndMT-derived expansion of the fibroblast pool.
Indeed, a subsequent study demonstrated the existence of a
Tie2-derived cardiac fibroblast population under normal condi￾tions96.
However, the vast majority of fibrosis was accounted for by the
pre-existing cardiac fibroblast pool and not by newly EndMT￾derived fibroblast population96,97.
At the same time, ischemic injury induces the appearance of
endothelium-like features in cardiac fibroblasts, the process
referred to as mesenchymal to endothelial transition98. The
fibroblast-derived endothelial cells exhibit functional and
anatomical characteristics of normal endothelial cells including
the ability to form vascular tubes and integrate into the newly
forming vasculature. The process appears to be mediated by
activation of p53-depedent gene transcription98 but many details
remain poorly understood and unexplored.
EndMT in CCM. CCM is a vascular disease that affects almost
exclusively the venous microvasculature of the central nervous
system and the retina99. CCM cavernomas are mulberry-like
malformations that lack the support of mural cells and tend to
bleed causing neurological problems such as headache, seizure
and eventually hemorrhagic stroke. This pathology occurs either
as sporadic or hereditary disease with an overall prevalence of up
to 0.5% of the human population. The hereditary form is an
autosomal dominant disease induced by the loss of function
mutation of any of three genes named Ccm 1(Krit1), Ccm 2
(Osm) and Ccm 3 (Pdcd10)100. The only therapy available so far
is neurosurgery that, however, may be dangerous depending on
the location of the malformation.
Murine models have been created through endothelial specific
inactivation of any one of the three CCM genes74,101,102. The
morphology of the malformations as well as the specific cerebral
localization are comparable to the human disease.
Either Ccm1 or Ccm3 null endothelial cells lining cavernomas
lumens have dismantled cell–cell junctions and exhibit a typical
EndMT phenotype switch74,103, including co-expression of
endothelial and mesenchymal markers (Fig. 3). This switch in
phenotype may explain many features of this disease, EndMT
entails the loss of cell polarity and of contact inhibition of growth
thus leading to formation of the typically enlarged and irregular
lumen of the cavernomas. However, other mechanisms triggered
by the absence of CCM genes may also contribute to the
development of the malformations as discussed below in more
detail.
Other pathologies associated with EndMT. In the tumour
stroma EndMT may be a source of cancer-associated fibroblasts
and may contribute, in this way, to cancer progression. The key
causative factor has not been defined yet but it is likely that TGFb
is involved. Cells undergoing EndMT in experimental tumors are
particularly enriched at the invasive front of the tumor likely
favouring invasion83,84. Furthermore, EndMT may play a positive
role in metastatic cancer cell intravasation104. During this
process the endothelium undergoing EndMT presents
dismantled junctions and cytoskeletal contractility favoring the
passage of tumour cells.
The actual contribution of EndMT to the overall number of
fibroblasts in the tumour stroma, however, remains unclear.
Taking into account the extreme functional variability of the
different subsets of tumor associated fibroblasts, we do not know
whether, and in which way, these endothelial-derived fibroblasts
may differ in function from the other fibroblast populations
present in the tumour stroma.
EndMT has also been proposed as the source of myofibroblasts
in the kidney. Myofibroblasts are the dominant collagen￾producing cells in many pathologies including organ fibrosis
and may substantially contribute to kidney fibrosis and dysfunc￾tion105,106. In the mouse experimental kidney fibrosis model
induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, the total pool of
myofibroblasts is composed of cells of different origins.
Up to 50% originate from proliferation of local tissue-resident
fibroblasts, while the EndMT transition gave origin to B10% of
these cells. 35% of the nonproliferating myofibroblasts derive
from bone marrow and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
contributes the remaining 5% (ref. 106).
Ablation of TGFbR2 in aSMA-positive cells significantly
reduced the number of myofibroblasts recruited in the area of
fibrosis underlining the importance of TGFb signalling in this
process. EndMT has also been implicated in the progression of
other pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, portal hypertension,
heterotopic ossification systemic sclerosis, diabetic renal
interstitial fibrosis and others. For space restriction we cannot
discuss in detail each of them although many of the general
characteristics of EndMT discussed above can apply also to these
pathologies77,94,107,108
Signalling pathways in EndMT
Given the extensive occurrence of EndMT, it naturally becomes
important to understand the molecular signals and pathways
leading to its development (Table 1). While there is a general

agreement that endothelial TGFb signalling is critical to postnatal
EndMT induction, just as it is during development, the mode of
its activation and contributory signalling pathways are subjects of
intense research.
A number of triggers have been proposed as EndMT drivers.
The two best characterized are the activation of the MEK5/ERK5/
BMP pathway after the loss of Ccm1 or Ccm2 gene expres￾sion109,110 and the activation of TGFbR signalling due to the loss
of FGFR1 signalling input and decline in let-7 expression56,80,81
(Fig. 4) The former pathway is an important driver for EndMT
in CCM settings while the latter is active in graft stenosis
and atherosclerosis. Other proposed EndMT drivers include
Wnt/b-catenin signalling that is known to act synergistically with
TGFb to promote EndMT in endocardial cells and in cavernomas
of Ccm3 deficient mice103,111 and certain miRs such as: miR-20a
that is down stream of FGF2 and targets TGFbR1 and R2
inhibiting EndMT57 and miR-21 that is induced by TGFb
signalling and promotes EndMT. Antagomir against miR-21
in vivo exerts antifibrotic effects by blocking End MT112.
Ccm1 ablation leads to the activation of a MEKK3-MEK5-
ERK5-MEF2 signalling axis that induces a strong increase in
Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) in ECs in vivo. Klf4 transcriptional
activity is responsible for the EndMT occurring in Ccm1-null
endothelial cells. This transcription factor acts both by directly
upregulating EndMT markers such as Fsp1, Sca 1, ID1 and also
by increasing BMP6 and TGFb signalling. In endothelial-specific
Ccm1 and Klf4 double knockout mice, the cerebral cavernomas
were strongly reduced and mortality essentially abrogated109.
Another study confirmed the role of KLF2/4 transcription
factors in the development of CCM but did not observe b-catenin
or Smad signalling in endothelial cells of Ccm -deficient
vessels113. These differences may be explained by the use of a
different experimental model. The Ccm1 and Ccm2 KO models
used by Zhou et al.113 exhibit a slower progression of the disease
than the Ccm1 and 3 knockout models used in previous
studies74,103,109.
Studies of human tissues demonstrated that not only both Klf4
and pSmad 3 were upregulated in the endothelium lining human
familial and sporadic CCM malformations, but that this was
accompanied by a substantial upregulation of EndMT markers
such as S100a4, aSMA, fibronectin, N-cadherin and ID1. Overall,
these data confirm the importance of Smad signalling and
EndMT switch in the endothelium lining CCM malformations in
human patients109,114.
Other pathways may also contribute to the development and
evolution of CCM including Notch, b1 integrins, autophagy,
oxygen radicals, angiopoietin 2 and others101,110,115–117.
However, their role in the induction of EndMT has not been
investigated yet.
A series of studies have established the important role played
by FGF signalling in control of the TGFb pathway. FGF signalling
is activated by an FGF binding to a cognate FGF receptor (FGFR);
this is followed by phosphorylation of an adaptor molecule FRS2a
that serves as a docking site for Shp2 and Grb2 that in turn act as
scaffold for a series of intracellular molecules, eventually
culminating in activation of MAPK and AKT118,119.Of the high
affinity FGF receptor tyrosine kinases, FGFR1 has the highest
level of expression in the endothelium80. Endothelial-specific
deletion of FGFR1 alone or together with FGFR2 (expressed at
very low levels) has no effect on vascular development,but
impairs vasculature response to injury120 and sets the stage for
EndMT induction121.
One of the consequences of endothelial-specific FRS2a or
FGFR1 deletion is a dramatic (a 20- to 120-fold) reduction in

case (left signalling sequence) reduction in let-7 levels results in increase
expression of TGFb family members’ expression and activation of TGFb
signalling. MiR20a is induced by FGF and contributes to inhibition of EndMT
by inhibiting TGFb receptors signalling. Conversely, miR 21 is downstream
TGFb signalling and reduces EndMT development. In the latter (right
signalling sequence), the loss of CCM inhibitory input activate MEKK3/
MEK5/ERK5 cascade resulting in induction of BMP/Smad signalling.

expression of let-7 miRNA family (Fig. 4). Mouse and human let￾7 miRNAs are the orthologs of C.elegans let-7 miRNA that plays
an important role in development by controlling cell differentia￾tion and proliferation122. Among let-7 targets is TGFbR1, and a
decline in these miRNAs’ expression leads to a large increase in
the receptor’s levels, along with that of other TGFb family genes,
including a 40-fold increase in TGFb2 levels. This increase in
both TGFb ligands and receptors expression leads to activation of
TGFb signalling and development of EndMT56,80. Importantly,
restoration of endothelial let-7 expression suppresses EndMT
development in vitro and in vivo. The let-7/TGFb link extends
past the endothelium: suppression of its expression by Lin-28,
a known negative regulator of let-7 biogenesis122, upregulates
TGFb-driven collagen production in glomerular mesangial
cells123.
These data raise the question of the pathological importance of
the FGFR-let-7-TGFbR pathway. Recent studies have shown that
endothelial FGFR1 expression is repressed by the presence of
certain inflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, IL1b and
interferon-g. Therefore, a decline in FGR1 levels may be
anticipated in the setting of chronic vascular inflammation.
Indeed, vascular inflammation is a hallmark of both transplant
arteriopathy and atherosclerosis and in both settings there is a
pronounced decrease in FGFR1 levels.
Abnormal shear stress may be another EndMT-inducing
stimulus, both in development and in adult settings124. EndMT
induction during development is critical to proper cardiac
morphogenesis: areas of high shear stress such as the
atrioventricular canal and cardiac outflow tract induction of
EndMT, due to activation of TGFb signalling125 and, indeed,
EndMT is necessary for endocardial cushions morphogenesis126.
Studies using cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells demon￾strated that uniform linear shear stress suppresses EndMT while
inducing expression of Klf2 and Klf4 transcription factors.
The latter represses arterial inflammation by binding to
nuclear factor-kappa-B127. This was mediated by the activation
of MEK5/ERK5 signalling as ERK5 silencing resulted in EndMT
induction93,125. However, these same transcription factors may
induce EndMT 109 and cause major problems in heart and
vascular development in Ccm-deficient animal models110,128.
The finding of important roles played by Klf4 and Klf2 in CCM
is certainly intriguing. Klf4 is a zinc finger protein that also
functions in pluripotent stem cell induction but it is also a
regulator of endothelial activation in response to pro-inflamma￾tory stimuli and TGFb signalling127,129. In CCM lesions, both
Klf4 and Klf2 are strongly upregulated but both transcription
factors are also detectable in normal arteries and veins in resting
conditions. This suggests that the level of Klf4 and Klf2
expression may dictate different types of cellular responses.
Similarly to the strong induction of its expression seen in CCM
lesions, Klf4 is also upregulated following the loss of endothelial
FGF signalling input80, another EndMT trigger, although its role
in this form of EndMT has not been established.
FGF signalling may also be involved in the shear stress-EndMT
link. Atherosclerosis-prone areas of the arterial vasculature
subjected to high shear stress demonstrate a reduction in FGFR1
expression and the appearance of low-level EndMT markers
expression while atherosclerosis-resistant areas exhibit high
FGFR1 expression81. It is interesting to speculate that a combi￾nation of vessel wall inflammation and abnormal shear stress may
account for the development of EndMT in a variety of vascular
diseases. Thus, EndMT may represent the key mechanism linking
abnormal mechanical stress and inflammation-dependent disease
progression.
Among miRNAs, miR-20a has been shown to be reduced
during EndMT and restoration of its expression correlated with
EndMT regression57. Under normal conditions, FGF signalling
maintains miR-20a expression and decreased EC FGF signalling,
as observed in atherosclerosis, would be expected to lead to the
reduction in miR-20a expression57. These predictions are in
agreement with the data implicating decreased FGF signalling in
the initiation of EndMT and atherosclerosis progression56,80,81.
In contrast, miR-21 is expressed downstream of TGFb and
activation of TGFb signalling leads to its overexpression and the
appearance of EndMT. Importantly, blockade of endothelial
miR-21 expression reduced EndMT112. These two miRNAs, thus,
act respectively upstream (miR-20a) and downstream (miR-21) of
activated TGFb signalling (Fig. 4).
Concluding remarks
Whilst the newly formed endothelial cells are in a primordial,
non-specialized state, they possess tremendous potential to
specialize their phenotype to perform a range of functions, as
well as give rise to other cell types necessary for blood and heart
development. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms
that govern these phenotypic changes and fate transitions,
including EHT and EndMT, will be key to developing therapies
to treat adult pathologies during which these processes have gone
awry.
After birth, EndMT may have a pathological significance in
different diseases and it is unclear whether it may be a reaction to
injury or ‘maladaptation’. One of the consequences of EndMT
is the increase in mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, pericytes
and smooth muscle cells and so on), and deposition of the
extracellular matrix that increases fibrosis in case of inflamma￾tion. However, the percentage of endothelial-derived fibroblasts
or smooth muscle cells may be limited and not substantial
enough to significantly contribute to fibrosis and scar formation.
In CCM, EndMT-derived endothelial cells show dismantled
junctions, VE- to N-cadherin switch, loss of polarity and
hyperproliferation. These pathological reactions lead to vascular
malformations and vessel fragility. In atherosclerosis, EndMT
contributes to plaque formation, a process that leads to arterial
lumen narrowing, by increasing the number of mesenchymal
cells, but also by producing the extracellular matrix proteins and
growth factors that indirectly increase mesenchymal proliferation.
Furthermore, luminal endothelial cells that have undergone
EndMT, express high levels of leukocyte binding molecules
thereby promoting their influx into the vessel wall.
This sets up a positive-feedback loop that likely plays a key role
in the relentless progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease. EndMT may, therefore, contribute in a variety of ways to
the progression of several pathologies. Increasing our knowledge
of this process may help to design more specific pharmacological
inhibitors able to interfere with endothelial fate transitions at the
right time and in the right location.
