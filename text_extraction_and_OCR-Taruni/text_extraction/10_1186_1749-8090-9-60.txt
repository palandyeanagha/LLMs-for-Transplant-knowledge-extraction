Abstract
Background: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effects and functional outcome of central
extracorporeal life support (ECLS) with left ventricular decompression for the treatment of refractory cardiogenic
shock and lung failure.
Methods: Between August 2010 and August 2013, 12 consecutive patients (2 female) with a mean age of
31.6 ± 15.1 years received central ECLS with left ventricular decompression for the treatment of refractory cardiogenic
shock and lung failure. Underlying disease was acute cardiac decompensation due to dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 3,
25%), coronary artery disease with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (n = 3, 25%), and acute myocarditis (n = 6, 50%).
We routinely implemented ECLS by cannulating the ascending aorta, right atrium and inserting a left ventricular
decompression cannula vent via the right superior pulmonary vein.
Results: All patients were successfully bridged to either recovery (n = 3, 25%), long-term biventricular support (n = 6, 50%)
or cardiac transplantation (n = 3, 25%). Seven patients (58.3%) were discharged after a mean hospital stay of 42 ± 11.9 days.
The overall survival from ECLS implantation to the end of the study was 58.3%. The cumulative ICU stay was 23.1 ± 9.6 days.
The length of support was 8.0 ± 4.3 days (range 3-17 days).
Conclusions: We strongly recommend left ventricular decompression in refractory cardiogenic shock and lung failure
to avoid pulmonary edema, left heart distension and facilitate myocardial recovery.

Background
Cardiogenic shock still has an unfavorable prognosis with
a mortality rate of 50-80% [1-4]. The prognosis strongly
depends on the delay between the compromise and rees￾tablishment of adequate end-organ perfusion. Analysis of
the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circu￾latory Support (INTERMACS) reveals that the proportion
of INTERMACS level 1 patients (cardiogenic shock) under￾going long term VAD therapy has decreased from 42%
in 2006 to 14% in 2012 due to poor outcomes. This has
provided impetus to implement a more effective support
strategy, which increasingly is taking the form of a
bridge to bridge (salvage) approach using temporary
extracorporeal devices in the first instance. Once the pa￾tient has been stabilised and has recovered end-organ
function, replacement with a long-term support device
can be considered [5].
Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) is an indispensable
therapy for the acute treatment of patients with cardiogenic
shock with or without lung failure. A common problem
observed during ECLS is the absence of left heart decom￾pression, which frequently leads to pulmonary edema and
left ventricular distension which if untreated can cause
subendocardial ischemia.

The purpose of our study was to objectively evaluate
our institutional experience of left heart unloading dur￾ing ECLS using a left ventricular vent with the aim of
developing appropriate clinical management strategies
and improving outcomes in this patient group.
Methods
Study design and patient cohort
A single arm, prospective study design was approved by
our Institutional Review Board (Medical faculty of the
University of Heidelberg). Patient demographics, preopera￾tive medical history, operative and post-operative course
data were collected from hospital medical records. Base￾line demographics are presented in Table 1. Between
August 2010 and August 2013 in our institution, 12
consecutive (2 female) patients (aged 31.6 ± 15.1 years,
range 12-65 years) underwent ECLS with left ventricular
decompression as a salvage procedure. The underlying
pathological condition was refractory cardiogenic shock
and lung failure in all study subjects (Figures 1 and 2).
Cardiogenic shock was defined as a cardiac index (CI)
lower than 2.2 liters/min/m2
, systolic pressure lower
than 90 mmHg for more than 30 minutes and clinical
signs of hypoperfusion (cold extremities, oliguria or al￾tered mental state) refractory to fluid resuscitation and
intravenous inotropic support. Respiratory failure was
defined as acute hypoxemia refractory to protective lung
strategy ventilation for acute lung injury or equivalent
(PaO2 < 8.0 kPa, PaCO2 > 6.7 kPa, pH < 7.2 at FiO2
1.00).
Surgical technique
A median sternotomy surgical approach was selected for
all patients in the expectation of potential upgrade to
long-term mechanical circulatory support. A 22 Fr. ar￾terial cannula (Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine,
USA) was inserted using the Seldinger technique into
the distal ascending aorta, and the right atrium was can￾nulated for venous return with a 28 Fr. cannula of ad￾justable conformation (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA)
which was oriented prior to insertion such that its tip
was directed towards the tricuspid valve. A heparin￾coated 24 Fr. venting cannula (Medtronic, Minneapolis,
USA), similarly pre-oriented, was inserted through the
right superior pulmonary vein into the left ventricle and
was connected to the ECLS inflow (venous drainage)
using a Y-connector (Figure 3). The ECLS system con￾sisted of a Levitronix CentriMag blood pump (Levitronix
LLC, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America),
a D902 ECMO oxygenator (Dideco, Sorin Group, Milan,
Italy) and phosphorylcholine P.h.i.s.i.o-coated circuit tub￾ing (Sorin Group, Milan, Italy). The maximum flow rate
through the vent cannula depends primarily on its diam￾eter and to a lesser extent its length.
The targeted extracorporeal support flow was 2.6 L/min/m2
body surface area for all patients. Intra-operative trans￾esophageal echocardiography (TEE) was routinely per￾formed to confirm correct positioning of the cannulas and
this technique was repeatedly applied postoperatively to
confirm adequate left ventricular decompression. ECLS
total blood flow and left heart vent blood flow were
monitored continuously using ultrasonic probes (Tran￾sonics Inc.) and continous brain oximetry (near-infrared
spectroscopy, INVOS™) was monitored during the In￾tensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. A three-way tap was rou￾tinely placed in the proximal venous line and in the left
ventricular vent line (Figure 4). This allowed separate
blood gas analyses to be performed in each line and
assisted in the detection of coronary hypoxia if the left
ventricle began to recover.
The ECLS weaning procedure consisted of intermittently
reducing the blood flow rate, having ascertained that the
left ventricle was not akinetic. This not only increased the
left ventricular preload but also decreased its afterload,
thereby facilitating left ventricle ejection. The feasibility of
weaning from ECLS was evaluated by clinical judgment
and transesophageal echocardiography at a reduced pump
flow after a minimum of 48 hours’ support. All patients
underwent daily TEE investigations, and procedural success
was defined as a sustained reduction in left ventricular dimen￾sions and an improvement in left ventricular contractility.
Anticoagulation management
Prior to the initiation of ECLS, an unfractionated hep￾arin bolus was administered i.v. at a dose of 300 IU/kg.

A similar dose was given if the patient had previously
been given heparin which had been fully reversed with
protamine. If the patient was on cardiopulmonary bypass
at the time ECLS was initiated, ECLS was instituted with
full heparinisation. Further unfractionated heparin ther￾apy was not administered in the first instance, and pro￾tamine sulphate was only administered if surgical
bleeding could not be controlled. In the post-operative
period, if bleeding was controlled, a continuous intra￾venous infusion of unfractionated heparin was initiated
immediately. A target activated clotting time range of
130–160 seconds was selected, which was measured. For
patients with persistent bleeding, for whom a surgical
cause had been excluded, heparin was discontinued and
not recommenced until the bleeding was under control.
Statistical analysis
Results of continuous variables are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation. For discontinuous variables absolute
and relative frequencies are reported. Statistical software
SPSS for Windows 21.0 (SPSS Ing, Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for data analysis.
Results
All twelve patients in the study cohort had fulminant car￾diogenic shock with lung failure. The underlying cause of
refractory cardiogenic shock was acute cardiac decompen￾sation due to dilated cardiomyopathy in three patients
(25%), coronary artery disease with acute myocardial in￾farction (AMI) in three patients (25%) and acute myocar￾ditis in six patients (50%) (Table 2).

All patients required mechanical ventilation with 100%
FiO2 with a mean peak inspiratory pressure of 32.0 ±
3.57 cmH2O and mean positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) of 9.9 ± 1.83 cmH2O. At the time of ECLS im￾plantation, patients received intravenous adrenaline at
a dose of 0.25 ± 0.07 μg/kg/min and noradrenaline at
0.28 ± 0.16 μg/kg/min. On admission, two patients were
supported with the CardioHelp™-System (Maquet, Rastatt,
Germany), which was upgraded to an ECLS with LV vent￾ing. The mean levels of serum creatinine and serum biliru￾bin before implantation, 24 h after implantation and
3 days after implantation are presented in (Figures 5 and
6). Ten patients had acute liver failure with serum biliru￾bin levels higher than 20 μmol/L.
The survival on ECLS support was 100%. All patients
were successfully bridged to either recovery (n = 3, 25%),
long-term biventricular support (n = 6, 50%) or cardiac
transplantation (n = 3, 25%) after mean ECLS support of
8.0 ± 4.3 days (range 3-17 days) (Table 2). The mean
cumulative ICU stay (including the stay after ECLS ex￾plantation or upgrade) was 23.1 ± 9.6 days. Of all twelve
cases, seven patients (58.3%) were discharged from hos￾pital after a mean hospital stay of 42 ± 11.9 days and are
currently alive. Three patients recovered on ECLS with
no recurrence of cardiac decompensation. The overall
survival from ECLS implantation to the end of the study
was 58.3%. Four patients died in hospital on ongoing
long-term BiVAD support after 60 ± 80.25 days. The
cause of death was septic multi-organ-failure in two pa￾tients and severe refractory acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) in two patients. One patient died of
primary graft failure after successful bridging to trans￾plantation with ECLS, resulting in the need for long-term
biventricular assist device (BiVAD) support.
The most frequent postoperative adverse events during
ECLS were: coagulation disorder (n = 8, 66.7%); refrac￾tory renal failure requiring hemodialysis (n = 6, 50%),
surgical re-exploration due to bleeding (n = 5, 41.7%)

Discussion
Inadequate left ventricular decompression and pulmon￾ary edema are recognised limitations of ECLS. Here, we
describe a novel technique for decompressing the left
ventricle using a modified central ECLS cannulation
technique. Blood is drained from the right atrium into
the extracorporeal system and is returned to the ascend￾ing aorta. To decompress the left ventricle, a large cali￾ber cannula is introduced in the left apex of the left
ventricle via the right superior pulmonary vein through
the mitral valve and is connected to the ECLS inflow
with a Y-connector. This strategy provides decompres￾sion of both left and right ventricle in order to give the
lungs and the left ventricle a chance to recover by de￾creasing myocardial oxygen consumption and preserving
coronary blood flow. This approach can be used as a
“bridge to recovery” and in cases of failed recovery as a
“bridge to bridge” until a long-term left ventricular assist
device (LVAD) or a biventricular assist device (BiVAD)
can be implanted (Figure 7).
ECLS provides immediate haemodynamic benefit, both
in terms of increased mean and diastolic arterial blood
pressure. However, this results in an increased systemic
afterload, which in the context of poor left ventricular
function may result in impaired left ventricular ejection
and persistent aortic valve closure. Severe left ventricular
distension can ensue which is potentiated by insufficient
right atrial drainage, bronchial and Thebesian venous
blood flow, aortic valve insufficiency, and extracardiac
left to right shunting. This situation can induce a com￾petitive flow and cause an impaired oxygen supply to the
coronary arteries and the cerebral vessels. Elevated left
ventricular end-diastolic volume and increased myocar￾dial wall stress results in increased myocardial oxygen
demand yet reduced perfusion of the coronary arteries.

This mismatch can result in subendocardial ischemia,
which can impair myocardial recovery [6,7]. This patho￾physiological mechanism can be ameliorated by adequate
left ventricular decompression during ECLS.
Furthermore, the absence of direct left ventricular de￾compression during ECLS under conditions where left
ventricular ejection is severely impaired can lead to in￾traventricular stasis of blood with a resultant risk of
thrombus formation. None of our patients showed evi￾dence of left ventricular thrombus during or after ECLS
treatment in spite of left ventricular cannulation. Rou￾tinely transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated
adequate decompression of the left ventricle in all study
patients.
In the absence of left ventricular venting, inadequate
left ventricular decompression during ECLS can remain
undetected for prolonged periods resulting in an eleva￾tion of the left-atrial pressure, which can potentially lead
to haemoptysis and pulmonary oedema [6]. These compli￾cations were not observed in the study cohort. Another
advantage of our technique is the ability to perform separ￾ate blood gas analyses from both the venous and left ven￾tricular cannula. This allows the monitoring of both
recovery of lung function and the timely detection of im￾paired coronary perfusion under conditions of improved
left ventricular function. This problem occurs if, during
ECLS the left ventricle starts to eject poorly saturated
blood from the lungs into the aortic root resulting in inad￾equate coronary arterial oxygen saturation. In such circum￾stances, it is mandatory to increase ventilatory support. It
has been shown in an animal model of ECLS with cannu￾lation of the ascending aorta that an adequate oxygen

supply of the coronary arteries could only be achieved
with high ECLS blood flow rates (85% of calculated max￾imum) [8]. For that reason, blood gas analysis samples
from the left ventricular vent are more informative to
those taken from the radial artery.
We believe that continuous monitoring of the cerebral ar￾terial saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy is mandatory
for monitoring cerebral perfusion during ECLS. It has
been shown that an unregulated increase of the cerebral
blood flow increases the risk of spontaneous cerebral
haemorrhage during ECLS [9]. Incorrect placement of the
aortic cannula in the truncus brachiocephalicus can lead
to impaired perfusion of the brain or, at worst, to cerebral
oedema and haemorrhage.
Although there are alternative systems for left ven￾tricular unloading like the axial flow Impella® system
(Abiomed, Danvers, USA) and the Tandem Heart™ sys￾tem (CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, USA), they lack oxygen￾ation capacity and only provide partial unloading of the
congested left ventricle. They are deemed unsuitable for
patients in refractory cardiogenic shock and respiratory
failure [10,11]. Although left ventricular decompression
can be achieved via a percutaneous transaortic/transsep￾tal catheter based system, because of the issues described
above and the requirement for cannulae of relatively
large diameter, central ECLS support with left ventricu￾lar decompression is preferred at our institution.
In recent years, portable miniaturized cardiopulmonary
bypass/ECMO devices providing up to 10 l/min of blood
flow with gas exchange have become available for the
treatment of acute cardiogenic shock. The Lifebridge™
(Lifebridge, San Antonio, USA) and CardioHelp™-System
(Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) are compact portable ECMO
systems. According to the latest AHA-guidelines, these
devices are recommended for patients with cardiogenic
shock after STEMI who fail to stabilize rapidly with
pharmacological therapy alone (class 1/Level of Evi￾dence B) [12]. Two of our study patients were trans￾ported to our centre whilst supported with one of these
systems (CardioHelp™-System). Support is implemented
by puncturing the groin vessels for peripheral veno￾arterial ECMO whilst maintaining external cardiac com￾pression. Patients attached to the emergency system can
be haemodynamically stabilized thereby allowing diagnos￾tic imaging or can be transferred to specialized centers
[13]. A recent meta-analysis of studies using percutan￾eous circulatory support during high-risk revasculari￾zation procedures showed a marked reduction in death
of patients in cardiogenic shock (45%) as well as in
those who has sustained a cardiac arrest refractory to
therapy (40%) [3]. Despite achieving good blood flow
rates through these compact systems, some patients do
not regain function of either the left ventricle or the
edematous lung and this is likely to be attributable, at
least in part, to the absence of effective left ventricular
decompression.
In the case of peripheral veno-arterial ECMO, if the
left ventricle ejects deoxygenated blood into the aorta,
there is a risk of cerebral and myocardial hypoxia as a
result of the left ventricle selectively perfusing the heart,
head and upper limbs whilst the peripheral ECMO per￾fuses the lower limbs and abdominal organs with oxy￾genated blood [8]. Myocardial and cerebral hypoxia can
go unrecognized [8] and it has been shown that periph￾eral cannulation is associated with a higher risk of
thrombus formation in the aortic root [14].
Peripheral support also necessitates arterial access,
with the potential danger of vessel injury and occlusion,
which can result in ischemia of the extremities. Cannula￾tion of the neck vessels can lead to injury of the jugular
vein or the carotid artery. Foley demonstrated a 21% in￾cidence of extremity ischemia with cannulation of the
femoral vessels. These patients were treated with fasciot￾omy and in one case an amputation had to be conducted
[15,16]. Limb ischaemia occurred in none of our pa￾tients. The risk of inadequate distal limb perfusion in pa￾tients undergoing peripheral cannulation is elevated in
those with comorbidities such as peripheral arterial dis￾ease and in children [15-17]. Consequently, alternative
cannulation sites such as central aortic cannulation and
axillary or subclavian artery cannulation should be con￾sidered early, to avoid distal limb ischemia.
The fourth annual INTERMACS report [5] revealed
that the proportion of INTERMACS level 1 patients has
dropped from 42% in 2006, when the database was im￾plemented, to 14% in 2012. Of these patients, only less
than 50% of were alive after 12 months [18]. Hence
INTERMACS level 1 status (cardiogenic shock) is the
greatest risk factor for mortality in VAD therapy [18].
Our study details a patient cohort with severe lung
edema and end-organ failure from within and outside
the catheter laboratory who were deemed to be candi￾dates for temporary circulatory support. They were not
considered suitable for long-term support as weaning
from cardiopulmonary bypass would have carried a high
risk due to respiratory failure. These patients did not
even qualify as INTERMACS level 1 for immediate
long-term VAD therapy.
The novel technique described here is believed to con￾fer a significant survival advantage given the dismal
prognosis of the study cohort at presentation to our in￾stitution. Also important is the timing of device inser￾tion, but this is largely influenced by the timing of
referral. Some poor outcomes following ECLS therapy
are due to delay in commencing support. Ideally, ECLS
should be considered prior to the onset or aggravation
of end-organ failure. After initial end-organ recovery

with portable consoles may be suitable devices for these
patients in future [19,20].
Conclusion
Our technique highlights the potential use of central
ECLS with direct left ventricular decompression in pa￾tients with refractory cardiogenic shock and lung failure
to facilitate myocardial recovery and prevent pulmonary
congestion. Separate blood gas analyses from the venous
cannula and the left ventricular vent allow monitoring of
pulmonary recovery and facilitate the early detection of
coronary hypoxia when the left ventricle begins to re￾cover. Moreover, this strategy is particularly suitable for
patients in extremis whose neurologic status is question￾able and thus candidacy for cardiac transplantation or
long-term support is uncertain. The novel technique de￾scribed is best suited to centers with established ECLS
infrastructure and activity levels, which maintain compe￾tency [21-28], [29]. For this reason, regionalization is
recommended to ensure that adequate volumes are
present at each ECMO center. Given the acuity of care
and the risk of sudden decompensation if the circuit
fails, intensive specialized staff training is mandatory.
