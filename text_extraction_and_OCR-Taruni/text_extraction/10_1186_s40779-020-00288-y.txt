Abstract
On October 5th, 2020, Drs. Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice were rewarded with Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine for “the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV)”. During the past 50 years, remarkable achievements
have been made in treatment of HCV infection: it has changed from being a life-threatening chronic disease to being
curable. In this commentary, we briefly summarized the milestone events in the “scientific journey” from the first report
of non-A, non-B hepatitis and discovery of the pathogen (HCV) to final identification of efficacious direct-acting
antivirals. Further, we address the challenges and unmet issues in this field.
Background
The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was
awarded to Drs. Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and
Charles M. Rice for the discovery of hepatitis C virus
(HCV). HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
hepatophilic virus. In contrast to oral transmission of
hepatitis A virus (HAV) and bodily fluids-mediated
transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV is primar￾ily transmitted through blood transfusion and intraven￾ous drug use. After acute HCV infection, approximately
75–85% of the patients develop chronic hepatitis C
(CHC). Patients with CHC are prone to hepatic cirrho￾sis, chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma
[1]. HCV infects more than 170 million people world￾wide, and approximately 10 million in China [1, 2], and
thus represents a huge healthcare and economic burden.
Discovery of HCV
Discovery of HCV began with the finding a novel type of
hepatitis in patients who received blood transfusion [3]
(Fig. 1). HAV and HBV were not present in such
patients [4, 5]. Alter and colleagues coined the term
“non-A, non-B hepatitis” in 1975 [4]. They collected
plasma/serum samples from a blood donor with chronic
hepatitis and 4 people who developed “non-A, non-B
hepatitis” after receiving blood transfusion, and injected
these samples to 5 chimpanzees. As they suspected, all 5
chimpanzees developed hepatitis, as evidenced by ele￾vated alanine aminotransferase as well as liver patho￾logical changes, confirming the presence of a yet
unknown transmissible agent in the blood of patients
with non-A, non-B hepatitis [6].
In 1989, Houghton and colleagues constructed a
random-primed complementary DNA library using
plasma samples from patients with non-A, non-B hepa￾titis [7]. One clone in this library was not derived from
host DNA, and appeared to be from a novel RNA virus
belonging to the Flavivirus family (at least 10,000 nucle￾otides and is positive-stranded) [7]. Houghton and col￾leagues named this novel virus as HCV and reported a
diagnostic assay using yeast-expressed recombinant
polypeptide based on HCV genome to capture viral anti￾bodies in the same journal that published the sequencing
information [8].
Rice and colleagues later constructed a full-length
clone of HCV complementary DNA that could tran￾scribe an infectious RNA variant of HCV [9]. Upon
intrahepatic inoculation of this clone, chimpanzees

developed chronic hepatitis, with production of anti￾bodies against HCV and viral replication in the blood
[9]. Subsequently, Bartenschlager and colleagues devel￾oped an in vitro cell culture using a human hepatoma
cell line to replicate HCV [10]. This cell-based model is
indispensable in revealing the biological features of HCV
as well as developing anti-HCV agents.
Identification and application of DAAs
Treatment of CHC with interferon-α, alone or in combin￾ation with ribavirin, is effective, but only in approximately
30% of the patients [11, 12]. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA)
medications that directly block the activity of HCV non￾structural proteins revolutionized the treatment of CHC
[13]. PSI-6130 was the first DAA that inhibits the HCV
NS5B RNA polymerase and selectively suppresses HCV
replication [14], but clinical development effort was aban￾doned due to low bioavailability. PSI-7851, also known as
sofosbuvir, is a PSI-6130 derivative [15], and improved
in vivo efficacy against HCV of various genotypes [16, 17].
Ledipasvir is a DAA that inhibits the HCV NS5A RNA
polymerase [18, 19]. The combination of sofosbuvir and
ledipasvir achieved >95% response rate with minimal side
effects in adult CHC patients [13]. The latest development
is Vosevi. As a polypill (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxila￾previr in a single tablet), Vosevi is easy to use, and has
many advantages, including improved pharmacokinetics
and strong antiviral activity. There has been speculation
that with Vosevi and other treatments in the pipeline, we
are now approaching the ultimate WHO goal of eradicat￾ing HCV by 2030.
Conclusion and perspective
Despite of the optimism brought about by the advances
in the past decades, many challenges are ahead [20].
First, there is no effective vaccine in sight. Also, cured
patients often fail to gain fully reinvigorated immunity.
Second, more efforts must be made to identify and treat
asymptomatic patients. Third, high risk behaviors (such
as needle sharing) must be curbed. Last but not least, ef￾fective treatments must be made accessible to all in￾fected people.
