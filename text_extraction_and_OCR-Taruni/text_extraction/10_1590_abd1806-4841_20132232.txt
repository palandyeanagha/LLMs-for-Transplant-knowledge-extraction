Abstract: Cutaneous protothecosis is a rare infection caused by achlorophyllic algae of the genus Prototheca. The
lesions usually occur on exposed areas, related with trauma, in immunocompromised patients. The most common
clinical presentation is a vesicobullous and ulcerative lesion with pustules and scabs, simulating bacterial, fungal
or herpetic infections or eczema. The diagnosis is determined by agent identification through histopathology, cul￾ture and the carbohydrates assimilation test. The finding of morula-like spherules is characteristic of Prototheca sp.
Its rarity and non-specific clinical aspect may difficult the disease diagnosis. We report a case of a diabetic patient,
in chronic use of systemic corticosteroids, that developed a skin lesion after trauma to the right leg.

Resumo: A prototecose cutânea é uma infecção rara causada por algas aclorofílicas do gênero Prototheca.
Geralmente as lesões ocorrem em áreas expostas, relacionadas à trauma, em indivíduos imunocomprometidos.
A apresentação clínica mais comum é uma lesão vesico-bolhosa e ulcerativa com pústulas e crostas, simulando
piodermites, infecções fúngicas, infecções herpéticas ou eczemas. O diagnóstico é realizado pela identificação do
agente através do exame histopatológico, da cultura e do teste de assimilação dos carboidratos. O achado de esfé￾rulas com aspecto de mórula são características da Prototheca sp. A raridade da doença e o aspecto clínico inespe￾cífico dificultam o diagnóstico da doença. Relatamos um caso em paciente diabética, em uso crônico de corticoi￾de sistêmico, que desenvolveu lesão cutânea após trauma na perna direita.

INTRODUCTION
Protothecosis is a rare infection caused by
achlorophyllic algae of the genus Prototheca.
1 They are
mainly found in the environment, in the soil, fresh
and salted water, mud of trees, sewage, animal waste
and in some types of food.2,3 They can colonize the
skin and nails.1 There are 3 clinical forms: cutaneous,
olecranon bursitis and systemic.1 The cutaneous form
is the most common, and most infections are caused
by  P. wickerhamii, in immunocompromised
patients.4,5 The lesions usually occur on exposed areas,
related with trauma.1 There are 77 cases of cutaneous
protothecosis described in the literature, 6 of them
published by Brazilian authors.1,6 We report the case of
a diabetes mellitus type II patient in chronic use of
systemic corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis, that
developed a skin lesion after trauma to the right leg.

CASE REPORT
A 61-year-old white woman, housewife by
occupation, born  in the state of Rio de Janeiro  and
raised in Araruama, a coastal city in an oceanic lakes
region, reported the appearance of an erythematous
and painful lesion in the right leg. It had developed 15
days before on an excoriation caused by local trauma
that occurred during hospitalization for investigation
of muscle weakness in the arms and legs. She was
treated with cephalexin 500mg, four times a day, for a
week, without improvement of the lesion and was
referred to the dermatology service. Her medical his￾tory disclosed hypertension and allergic rhinitis in
prolonged treatment with systemic corticosteroids in
anti-inflammatory doses, since the age of 14-year-old
(in the last year, intramuscular injections of
betamethasone 7mg/week). During hospitalization, a
motor and sensory neuropathy and type II diabetes
mellitus were diagnosed and the treatment with met￾formin 850mg, 3 times a day, was started, with control
of glucose blood level. The patient was discharged
and the investigation of skin lesions continued in the
dermatology service.
Dermatological examination revealed an ery￾thematous, tender and painful plaque covered by pus￾tules and scabs on the right leg (Figure 1).
The clinical picture suggested the diagnosis of
erysipela, staphylococcal folliculitis, dermatophytosis
and sporotrichosis.
Hematologic and biochemical laboratory find￾ings were normal, except for high glucose levels
(150mg/dL) before the introduction of metformin.
HIV and hepatitis tests were negative.
A swab was collected from the pustules in addi￾tion to biopsy of the lesion. Cultures from the swab
were performed for bacteria and fungi and were neg￾ative or both. Fifteen days after sowing, the cultures
on Sabouraud dextrose agar and blood agar, devel￾oped white, creamy, yeast-like colonies (Figure 2).
Culture microscopy showed sporangiospores within
the sporangia, with morula-like aspect, consistent
with Prototheca sp.
Histopathology revealed a suppurative and
granulomatous inflammation in the dermis. The peri￾odic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) revealed morula-like
structures in the suppurative area (Figure 3). The
same structures were colored in black by the Grocott
silver stain (Figure 4).
For species identification, a suspension of the
culture was submitted to the carbohydrate assimila￾tion test by the Vitek automated system, indicating P.
wickerhamii as the causative species.
After the diagnosis of cutaneous protothecosis,
treatment was started with itraconazole at a dose of 200
mg daily for 3 months with complete healing of the lesion.

DISCUSSION
The first human protothecosis case was
described by Davies and colleagues in
1964.7 Clinically the infection can present three forms:
cutaneous, olecranon bursitis and systemic protothe￾cosis.8 Up to now, 117 cases of protothecosis were
reported.1 77 of those cases were of the cutaneous
form, and 6 were described by Brazilian authors.1,6
It mainly affects immunocompromised
patients. Risk factors include prolonged use of
steroids, malignancies, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, organ
transplantation and surgeries.1
FIGURE 4: Histopathology showing Prototheca sp. structures, 
colored in black, by Grocott silver stain. (X400) 
The cutaneous infection is the most frequent
clinical form.1 It occurs on exposed areas, mainly on
the extremities and face.9 Sometimes it can be associat￾ed with trauma.5,8 The most common presentation is
vesiculobullous and ulcerative lesion with purulent
discharge and crusting. However, other forms have
been described: erythematous plaques, pustules,
papules, nodules, verrucous lesions, hypopigmented
or atrophic lesions.1 Differential diagnosis includes
bacterial infections, fungal infections, herpes simplex
virus infections and eczema.1,3,4,5,9,10
Diagnosis depends on morphological identifi￾cation of the organisms through histology, culture and
carbohydrate assimilation test.1,2,8,10 Sporangiospores
within the sporangia forms a morula-like structure
typical of Prototheca sp.
1,3
Many treatment regimens have been attempt￾ed, but there has been no consistency in the clinical
response.1,8 Azole antifungals such as ketoconazole,
fluconazole and mainly itraconazole are used for
localized infections.5 Amphotericin B is the most effec￾tive drug against protothecosis and is reserved for dis￾seminated and visceral infections.5 For localized cuta￾neous forms, surgical debridement or excision can be
employed.4
The rarity and nonspecific clinical appearance
of protothecosis complicate the differential diagnosis
with other skin infections and disorders, reinforcing
the importance of the etiologic agent research.q
