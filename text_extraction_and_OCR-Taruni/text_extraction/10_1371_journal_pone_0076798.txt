Abstract
Background and Aims: There is lack of a practical biomarker to predict sustained virological response (SVR) in
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN). The aim of this pilot study was to
identify immunological features associated with SVR.
Methods: Consecutive 74 CHB patients receiving 24 weeks (for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive) or 48 weeks
(for HBeAg-negative) PEG-IFN, were prospectively enrolled. Serum HBV viral loads, hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), CXCL9, IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) were measured at baseline and week 12. SVR was defined as HBeAg seroconversion combined with viral
load <2000 IU/mL in HBeAg-positive (n=36), and viral load <2000 IU/mL in HBeAg-negative patients (n=38) at 48
weeks after the end of treatment.
Results: Nineteen patients (25.7%), 7 in HBeAg-positive and 12 in HBeAg-negative, achieved SVR. There were
significant declines of HBV DNA, HBsAg, IP-10 and IFN-γ levels at week 12. In multivariate analysis, pre-treatment
CXCL9 >80 pg/mL, HBV DNA <2.5 x 107
 IU/mL and on-treatment HBV viral load, HBsAg decline >10% at week 12
were predictors of SVR. The performance of CXCL9 in predicting SVR was good in patients with HBV DNA <2.5 x
107
 IU/mL, particularly in HBeAg-negative CHB cases (positive predictive value, PPV= 64.3%).
Conclusions: Pre-treatment CXCL9 level has the potential to select CHB patients who can respond to PEG-IFN,
especially in HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads.

Introduction
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a
challenging global health problem, with more than 350 million
carriers worldwide [1]. The spectrum and the natural course of
chronic HBV infection are diverse and variable, ranging from an
inactive carrier state to progressive chronic hepatitis B (CHB),
which may evolve to hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2]. Both host and viral factors
play critical roles in the natural history of CHB, disease activity
as well as efficacies of antiviral therapies [3,4]. Impaired host
immune response against HBV is commonly observed in
patients with CHB, which might be related to persistent high
viral loads with subsequent T cell exhaustion [5]. Current
antiviral strategies for CHB aim at effective viral suppression as
well as restoration of HBV-specific immune responses.
Peginterferon-alpha-2a (PEG-IFN), which has direct antiviral
and immuno-modulatory effects, is currently one of the first-line
treatment options for CHB [6,7]. Antiviral therapy with PEG-IFN
has been shown to be effective in suppressing HBV replication,
and may result in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)
seroconversion, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance,
normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and
histological improvement [6,7]. Patients who achieve an IFN￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76798

induced virological response may have a long-term therapeutic
effect and a reduced risk of cirrhosis and HCC [8,9]. However,
only about 30% of CHB patients treated with PEG-IFN could
achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) [10–13].
Several baseline and on-treatment indicators have been
identified to predict treatment response to PEG-IFN [7,10]. In
HBeAg-positive CHB, low viral load, high serum ALT levels,
HBV genotype and high activity scores on liver biopsy are pre￾treatment predictors of HBeAg seroconversion [14,15],
whereas currently there are no strong pre-treatment predictors
of virological response in HBeAg-negative CHB patients [7].
During the treatment, declines of viral load and HBsAg levels at
12 weeks are strong predictors of virological response in both
HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients [16–18].
Based on the immuno-modulatory properties of PEG-IFN,
host immune status may have influence on the efficacy of
PEG-IFN for CHB. In recent years, several studies have shown
the potential roles of cytokines and chemokines in chronic viral
hepatitis. CXCL9 (monokine induced by IFN-γ [MIG]) and IP-10
(IFN-γ-inducible protein 10, also called CXCL10) have been
reported to play important roles during hepatitis flares in CHB
[19]. In patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, lower
baseline and on-treatment IP-10 levels may predict a higher
rate of virological response to IFN-based therapy [20–22].
Recently, we also demonstrated a correlation of IP-10 with
higher hepatitis activity in patients with CHB [4]. Pro￾inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) may also have roles in
suppressing HBV replication [1,23,24]. However, the clinical
significance of these cytokines and chemokines during PEG￾IFN therapy is unclear. IL28B single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) have been shown to correlate with IFN-induced
treatment response in patients with chronic hepatitis C, as well
as HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive CHB patients
[25–28]. However, the role of IL28B SNPs in predicting SVR to
PEG-IFN therapy for CHB patients is still debated.
Currently, pre-treatment and on-treatment predictors of SVR
in CHB patients under PEG-IFN therapy remain unsatisfactory
to meet clinical need. The aim of this pilot study was to
investigate the dynamics of cytokines and chemokines during
PEG-IFN treatment, and to evaluate the baseline and on￾treatment immunological and viral factors associated with SVR
in CHB patients treated with PEG-IFN.
Materials and Methods
Patients
From January 2010 to July 2011, consecutive 74 CHB
patients receiving PEG-IFN alfa-2a 180µg per week at the
Taipei Veterans General Hospital were prospectively enrolled.
All patients were positive for serum HBsAg for more than 6
months and patients receiving PEG-IFN therapy fulfilled the
treatment criteria for CHB according to the American
Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) treatment
guidelines, i.e. serum ALT levels >80 U/L [2 x upper limit of
normal (ULN)] with HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL in HBeAg￾positive patients or >2,000 IU/mL in HBeAg-negative patients
[6]. All patients were negative for any of the following points: (1)
coinfection with HCV, hepatitis D virus, or human
immunodeficiency virus, (2) alcoholic liver disease, (3)
suspected autoimmune diseases with antinuclear antibody
(ANA) titer ≥1:160, positive test for anti-smooth muscle
antibody or anti-mitochondrial antibody, (4) use of hepatotoxic
drug or Chinese herb, and (5) radiological evidence of cirrhosis
or HCC (i.e., abdominal sonogram, computed tomography
scan, or magnetic resonance imaging scans). In general, the
treatment duration was 24 weeks for HBeAg-positive, and 48
weeks for HBeAg-negative cases, which is under the regulation
of Bureau of National Health Insurance, Taiwan. In HBeAg￾positive patients, additional 24 weeks of PEG-IFN was allowed
without reimbursement.
After initiating PEG-IFN treatment, patients were
subsequently followed at the outpatient clinic every 2 to 4
weeks. Peripheral blood samples and HBV viral loads were
evaluated at baseline, week 12, the end of treatment (EOT), 24
and 48 weeks after PEG-IFN treatment for serological and
virological tests. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, which
complied with standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and
current ethical guidelines. All patients provided written informed
consents for participation of the study.
End point and definition
The primary end point was sustained virological response
(SVR). In HBeAg-positive patients, SVR was defined as a
combination of HBeAg seroconversion, indicated as
seronegative of HBeAg and seropositive of anti-HBe in serum,
with HBV DNA level less than 2000 IU/mL at 48 weeks after
the end of PEG-IFN therapy. In HBeAg-negative patients, SVR
was defined as HBV DNA level less than 2000 IU/mL at 48
weeks after the end of PEG-IFN therapy [7].
Liver biochemistry and viral serology tests
Serum biochemical studies were performed using a systemic
multi-autoanalyzer (Technicon SMAC, Technicon Instruments
Corp., Tarrytown, NY). The serum samples were tested for the
presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe antibody using radio￾immunoassay (Abott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), while
HBV DNA was determined by Roche Cobas Tagman HBV
DNA assay (detection limit of 12 IU/mL, Roche Diagnostics,
Switzerland).
Detection, genotyping and sequencing of HBV DNA
Genotyping of HBV was performed by PCR restriction
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the surface
gene of HBV [29,30]. Briefly, DNA was extracted from serum,
and the fragment of the HBV genome between nucleotide
position 120 and 604 was amplified by semi-nested PCR. The
PCR products were subsequently treated with restriction
enzymes. After incubation, the samples were run on a 4%
agarose gel and stained by ethidium bromide. To confirm the
correct genotyping, direct sequencing from the PCR products
was done.
To detect precore G1896A and basal core promoter (BCP)
A1762T/G1764A mutations, sequencing of the core region of
HBV DNA was performed in all patients. Semi-nested PCR was

performed by using a pair of primers: internal primers 1653F
(5’-CATAAGAGGACTCTTGGACT-3’, position 1653-1672) and
1974R (5’-GGAAAGAAGTCAGAAGGC-3’, position
1974-1957); external primers: 1623F (5’-
TCGCATGGAGACCACCGTCT-3’, position 1623-1640) and
2076R (5’-ATAGCTTGCCTGAGTGC-3’, position 2076-2060)
as previously described [6,21].
The PCR products were then subjected to the dye-terminator
cycle sequencing reaction using specific primers according to
the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Dye
terminator cycle sequencing core kit no. 402117, Perkin Elmer
Cetus Corp., Norwalk, CT). To avoid false positive results,
instructions to prevent cross contaminations were strictly
followed.
Serum HBsAg quantification
HBsAg levels were quantified using the Elecsys HBsAg II
assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The detection limit
of the Elecsys HBsAg II assay was 0.05 IU/mL.
Enzyme-linked sorbent assay (ELISA)
The concentrations of CXCL9 and IP-10 were tested by
commercialized human cytokine ELISA kits from PeproTech
(Rocky Hill, NJ). The concentrations of IFN-γ and TGF-β were
tested by commercialized human cytokine ELISA kits from
eBioscience (San Diego, CA). The procedure followed the
instruction provided by manufactures.
IL28B genotyping
Four SNPs of IL28B including rs8105790, rs12979860,
rs8099917 and rs10853728 were chosen according to previous
reports and our study [4,25–28,31]. The genotype of
rs12979860 was tested using TaqMan custom-designed
rs12979860 probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA;
forward primer GCCTGTCGTGTACTGAACCA, reverse primer
GCGCGGAGTGCAATTCAAC, and the probes
TGGTTCGCGCCTTC [VIC] and CTGGTTCACGCCTTC
[FAM], respectively) [32]. The genotypes of the rs8105790,
rs8099917 and rs10853728 were determined with the ABI
TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems) and
with predesigned commercial genotyping assays (ABI assay
C__43813808_10, C__11710096_10, C__11710090_10).
Briefly, PCR primers and two allelic-specific probes was
designed to detect a specific SNP target. The PCR reactions
were performed in 96-well microplates with ABI 7900 real-time
PCR (Applied Biosystems) as previously described [4].
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0 for Windows, SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL). Values were expressed as median (ranges)
or as mean ± standard deviation when appropriate. The
correlation between serum ALT and chemokine levels were
tested by Spearman’s test. Pearson chi-square analysis or
Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables,
while the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to
compare continuous variables. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was
used to compare serial changes in virological and
immunological factors. Variables with p<0.1 were analyzed by
multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent
variables for predicting SVR. The best cut-off value of each
variable was determined by the receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (Youden index) using MedCalc
(version 4.20, MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). A 2-
tailed p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of CHB patients receiving PEG-IFN
therapy
Baseline characteristics of the 74 CHB patients were
summarized in Table 1. Patients were predominantly males
(77%) and genotype B (64.9%). BCP mutations and precore
mutations were observed in 31.1% and 47.3% of patients,
respectively. The prevalence of the major IL28B genotypes
rs8105790 TT, rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, and
rs10853728 CC were 94.6%, 93.2%, 94.6% and 71.6%,
respectively. In the 36 HBeAg-positive patients, 30 (83.3%)
received 24-weeks and 5 6 (16.7%) received 48-week PEG￾IFN therapy. All 38 HBeAg-negative patients received 48-week
PEG-IFN therapy. Seventy-three (98.6%) patients completed
the full course of PEG-IFN therapy, while 1 (1.4%) patient
discontinued PEG-IFN treatment due to intolerance and were
switched to oral antiviral therapies. The patient who failed to
complete PEG-IFN therapy was classified as non-responder to
PEG-IFN for analysis in this study.
Treatment response
Overall, 19 patients (25.7%) had achieved SVR at 48 weeks
after the end of PEG-IFN treatment. Among the 36 HBeAg￾positive patients, 12 (33.3%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion,
including 10 of the 30 patients (33.3%) receiving 24-week
course of treatment and 2 of the 6 patients (33.3%) receiving
48-week course of treatment; whereas only 7 (19.4%) finally
achieved SVR, including 6 of the 30 patients (20%) receiving
24-week course of treatment and 1 of the 6 patients (16.7%)
receiving 48-week course of treatment. In HBeAg-negative
patients, 12 (31.6%) achieved SVR and 2 cases (5.3%)
achieved HBsAg clearance at 48 weeks after the end of PEG￾IFN treatment. During the extended follow-up period between
24 to 48 weeks post treatment, one HBeAg-positive patient
developed HBeAg seroconversion and one HBeAg-negative
patient had viral relapse.
Dynamic changes of virological and immunological
factors
Dynamic changes of serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, cytokine and
chemokine levels from baseline to week 12 of PEG-IFN
treatment were shown in Table 2. Viral load, HBsAg, IP-10 and
IFN-γ levels significant declined after 12 weeks of PEG-IFN
treatment. No significant changes were observed in CXCL9
and TGF-β levels from baseline to week 12 in overall patients.
CXCL9 Predicts SVR of CHB
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76798

In patients with SVR, CXCL9 levels significantly decreased
from baseline to week 12, and further decreased at EOT (mean
value 228.4, 153.1 and 52.7 pg/mL at baseline, week 12 and
EOT, respectively; baseline vs week12, p=0.039; week 12 vs
EOT, p=0.208; Figure 1). In patients without SVR, CXCL9
levels remained high at week 12 but decreased later from week
12 to EOT (mean value 126.2, 136.2 and 103.8 pg/mL at
baseline, week 12 and EOT, respectively; baseline vs week12,
p=0.754; week 12 vs EOT, p=0.005, Figure 1).
The early CXCL9 levels decline positively correlated with the
declines of HBV DNA (r=0.319, p=0.014) and HBsAg levels
(r=0.315, p=0.023) at week 12 of PEG-IFN therapy. In contrast,
no significant correlations were noted between IP-10 levels
decline and declines of viral load or HBsAg levels.
Correlation between serum ALT and chemokine levels
Serum ALT, CXCL9 and IP-10 levels were measured at each
time point during PEG-IFN treatment for correlation analysis
(overall n=232). As shown in Figure 2, ALT had positive
correlation with both serum CXCL9 (r=0.335, p<0.001) and
IP-10 levels (r=0.423, p<0.001) by Spearman’s test. Serum
CXCL9 and IP-10 levels also had a positive correlation with
each other (r=0.353, p<0.001).
Baseline predictors of SVR
Compared with patients not achieving SVR, patients with
SVR had significantly lower HBV DNA, HBsAg levels and
higher CXCL9 levels (Table 1). In contrast, HBV genotypes,
precore or BCP mutations, serum IP-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β levels
and the four IL28B SNPs were not associated with SVR. In
univariate analysis, age, HBV viral loads, HBsAg and CXCL9
levels were factors associated with SVR (Table 3). In
multivariate analysis, HBV DNA <2.5 x 107
 IU/mL and CXCL9
>80 pg/mL were pre-treatment predictors of SVR (Table 3).
In HBeAg-positive patients, age, precore mutation, baseline
HBV viral loads and CXCL9 levels correlated with SVR in
univariate analysis, while HBV DNA <2.5 x 107
 IU/mL was the

only predictor of SVR in multivariate analysis (Table S1). In
HBeAg-negative patients, HBV DNA, HBsAg and CXCL9 levels
correlated with SVR in univariate analysis, while CXCL9 >80
pg/mL was the only pre-treatment predictors of SVR in
multivariate analysis (Table S2).
On-treatment predictors of SVR
In univariate analysis, HBV viral load and HBsAg levels, HBV
DNA decline >2 Log10 and HBsAg decline >10% at week 12
were on-treatment factors associated with SVR (Table 3). None
of the patients who did not have HBsAg decline >10% at week
12 achieved SVR. Although significant dynamic changes of
IP-10 and IFN-γ levels from baseline to week 12 were noted,
none of these factors were associated with SVR. In multivariate
analysis, the on-treatment predictors of SVR were HBV DNA
<2000 IU/mL and HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 (Table 3).
In HBeAg-positive patients, only HBV DNA decline >2 Log10
was the on-treatment predictor SVR in uni- and multi-variate
analyses (Table S1). In HBeAg-negative patients, HBsAg
levels and HBsAg decline >10% correlated with SVR in
univariate analysis, while HBsAg decline >10% was the only
on-treatment predictor of SVR in multivariate analysis (Table
S2).

treatment. The mean baseline CXCL9 levels in patients with or
without achieving HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL during PEG-IFN
treatment were 191.6 vs. 68.5 pg/mL, respectively (p=0.004).
Among the 28 patients with baseline CXCL9 >80 pg/mL, 24
(85.7%) had ever achieved HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL, whereas
in the 46 patients with baseline CXCL9 <80 pg/mL, only 26
(56.5) had ever achieved HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL (p=0.019).
Predictive values of baseline CXCL9 levels on SVR
In order to identify patients who had higher chance of SVR
before PEG-IFN treatment, an algorithm based on combination
of baseline serum CXCL9 and HBV DNA levels was
established (Figure 3). Patients with baseline high viral loads
generally had a low chance of SVR. Among 47 patients with
low viral loads, 13 of 22 patients with CXCL9 >80 pg/mL
achieved SVR (positive predictive value (PPV)=59.1%),
whereas only 5 of 25 (20%) patients with CXCL9 <80 pg/mL
had SVR (Figure 3A). The SVR rate was lowest (0%) in
patients with baseline low CXCL9 levels but high viral loads
(negative predictive value (NPV) = 100%). The predictive value
of CXCL9 was not dominant in HBeAg-positive patients (Figure
3B), but the performance of CXCL9 in predicting SVR was
good in HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads
(PPV=64.3%, Figure 3C).
Discussion
Interferon therapy for CHB remains a clinical challenge.
Although successful PEG-IFN treatment may induce a durable
response and reduce liver-related complications, most of
patients could not achieve virological response [10–13], and
only a minority of patients choose PEG-IFN as initial antiviral
treatment for CHB due to the concern of side effects in Taiwan.
Therefore, individualized treatment strategies according to
pretreatment and on-treatment parameters should be
developed to identify patients with a highest chance of
response. However, currently there is no ideal pre-treatment
predictor of SVR, especially in HBeAg-negative patients. In this

SVR, CXCL9 levels significantly decreased from baseline to week 12, whereas in patients without SVR, CXCL9 levels remained

prospective pilot study, we demonstrated the dynamic changes
of serum cytokines and chemokines during PEG-IFN therapy
and showed that baseline CXCL9 level strongly correlated with
SVR in patients with CHB.
In the current study, the HBeAg seroconversion rate and
SVR rate in HBeAg-positive patients receiving 24-week PEG￾IFN treatment (33.3% and 20%, respectively) were comparable
with the results reported in previous studies [11,33,34]. In
HBeAg-negative patients, the SVR (31.6%) and HBsAg
clearance (5.3%) rates were also consistent with those from
the previous reports [35,36].
Declines of serum IP-10 levels have been observed during
PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB patients [37]. In our
study, we also observed a significant decline of IP-10 and IFN￾γ levels 12 weeks after PEG-IFN treatment, which might reflect
a lessened hepatic necro-inflammatory activity after treatment.
Although there was no significant change in CXCL9 levels at
week 12 in overall patients, patients with SVR had a significant
early decline of CXCL9 levels while patients without SVR had a
late CXCL9 levels decline (Figure 1). The early CXCL9 decline
in patients with SVR might represent an early viral suppression,
as supported by the positive correlations between early CXCL9
levels decline and declines of viral load and HBsAg levels.
Unfortunately, the early CXCL9 decline could not accurately
predict SVR (SVR rate of 35.3% and 17.4% in patients with
and without early CXCL9 decline, respectively, p=0.240).
Consistent with recent studies showing that HBsAg decline at
week 12 strongly correlated with SVR [17,18,38], our data also
demonstrated that none of the patients who did not have
HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 achieved SVR in this study.
HBsAg clearance is a benefit of interferon treatment. It will be
interesting to define the relationship between the baseline level
of HBsAg and HBsAg clearance, as well as the role of baseline
level and dynamic changes of CXCL9 on HBsAg loss.
However, during the limited follow-up period of this study, only
2 cases achieved HBsAg clearance. Further large long-term
follow-up studies are needed to delineate the role of CXCL9 on
HBsAg clearance.
The finding that older patients have higher rates of SVR in
univariate analysis might relate to lower viral loads in elder
people. Although IL28B SNPs have been shown to predict SVR
in patients with chronic hepatitis C and correlate with hepatitis
activity in CHB [4,25–27], there was no correlation between
IL28B SNPs and SVR in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg￾negative patients. The role of CXCL9 in CHB patients receiving
PEG-IFN has not been reported before. CXCL9 and IP-10 were
reported to correlate with hepatic injury during hepatic flares in
CHB [19]. A strong correlation of serum CXCL9 and IP-10
concentrations with ALT levels was also noted [19]. Consistent
with previous report, our results also showed positive
correlations between CXCL9, IP-10 and ALT levels. The
positive correlations between these parameters may imply that
these chemokines have positive impact on the liver
inflammation and HBV control, albeit the relevance was not
good due to complex interactions between other host and viral
factors that contribute the liver inflammation. These findings
suggest that both CXCL9 and IP-10 are associated with
hepatic necro-inflammation and may be surrogates of the host
immune response against HBV infection. IP-10 has been
shown to correlate with SVR to IFN-based therapy in patients
with HCV infection [20–22]. Sonneveld, et al recently reported
that high pretreatment serum IP-10 levels were associated with
HBeAg loss after 52 weeks of PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg￾positive patients, albeit the predictive value for combined
serological and virological response was less prominent [37].
Different HBV genotypes and duration of PEG-IFN treatment
may influence the predictive role of IP-10 in HBeAg-positive
patients.
Baseline CXCL9 level significantly correlates not only with
SVR, but also with on-treatment viral suppression. This finding
supports a stronger host immune response at baseline having
a higher chance of SVR under interferon treatment. A recent
finding also showed that HBeAg-negative CHB patients with
greater baseline HBV-specific CTL responses had a better on￾treatment control of HBV replication during PEG-IFN treatment
[39].
CXCL9 and IP-10 are chemokines that bind to the cell
surface chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is highly expressed
on effector T cells and plays an important role in T cell
trafficking and function [40,41]. An animal study showed that
HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced CXCL9
and IP-10 production and subsequently recruited host
inflammatory cells responsible for liver damage [42,43]. Lower
levels of CXCL9 and IP-10 correlate with HBV persistence in
an animal model [44]. In human study, elevated CXCL9 and
IP-10 involve in liver inflammation during hepatitis flares in
CHB [19]. Our results showed a positive correlation between
CXCL9 and IP-10 levels, representing that both chemokines
were induced and participated in immune responses against
HBV infection. Although both CXCL9 and IP-10 are ligands of
CXCR3, they have distinct properties. IP-10 is induced by a
variety of innate stimuli that can further induce IFN-α/β, and is
responsible for recruiting type-1 helper (Th1)-type CD4+
 T cells,
effector CD8+
 T cells and innate-type lymphocytes, such as
natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. In contrast, the induction of
CXCL9 is restricted to IFN-γ, and its function is predominantly
in recruiting CD8+
 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [41]. The underlying
mechanism of CXCL9 level correlates with SVR deserves
further study.
The strong correlation of baseline CXCL9 levels with SVR
indicates that CXCL9 might serve as a marker to select CHB
patients suitable for PEG-IFN therapy, especially in HBeAg￾negative cases with low viral loads. In contrast, the SVR rate in
patients with high viral loads was low regardless of their
baseline CXCL9 levels, suggesting that host antiviral immunity
might be overwhelmed by high viral loads.
As a pilot study, the case number was small. It was also due
to fewer than 5% of CHB patients in Taiwan had the will to
receive PEG-IFN as initial antiviral treatment. Therefore, it is
important to identify a pre-treatment marker to predict response
to PEG-IFN, not only to encourage patients to receive PEG-IFN
treatment but also to save the medical resources for those with
a high chance of response. Further large and long-term follow
up studies are needed to determine the appropriate cutoff level
of CXCL9, and to observe the predictive value of CXCL9 on
delayed virological response and HBsAg clearance.

In conclusion, CXCL9 might be used to select appropriate
CHB patients to receive PEG-IFN treatment, especially in
HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads.
