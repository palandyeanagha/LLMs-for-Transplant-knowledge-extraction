Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a vascular remodeling disease with limited therapeutic 
options. Although exposed to stressful conditions, pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) 
exhibit a “cancer-like” pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotype. HDAC6 is a cytoplasmic histone 
deacetylase regulating multiple pro-survival mechanisms and overexpressed in response to stress in 
cancer cells. Due to the similarities between cancer and PAH, we hypothesized that HDAC6 expression 
is increased in PAH-PASMCs to face stress allowing them to survive and proliferate, thus contributing 
to vascular remodeling in PAH. We found that HDAC6 is significantly up-regulated in lungs, distal 
PAs, and isolated PASMCs from PAH patients and animal models. Inhibition of HDAC6 reduced PAH￾PASMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in vitro sparing control cells. Mechanistically, we 
demonstrated that HDAC6 maintains Ku70 in a hypoacetylated state, blocking the translocation of 
Bax to mitochondria and preventing apoptosis. In vivo, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 improved 
established PAH in two experimental models and can be safely given in combination with currently 
approved PAH therapies. Moreover, Hdac6 deficient mice were partially protected against chronic 
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Our study shows for the first time that HDAC6 is implicated 
in PAH development and represents a new promising target to improve PAH.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a complex and multifactorial disease characterized by a progressive 
elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, due to a cancer-like proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype 
of pulmonary artery (PA) cells including smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and endothelial cells (PAECs)1
. This 
ultimately leads to right ventricular (RV) failure and premature death. Despite recent advances in molecular 
pathogenesis and treatment, none of the current treatment strategies cures this devastating condition2
. Therefore, 
the identification and characterization of new targets specifically implicated in this pathological state and simul￾taneously disabling more than one mechanism of disease development and progression is a pressing need3
. 
Interestingly, the documentation of numerous similarities shared by PAH and cancer cells4–7
, brings an emerging 
paradigm in PAH pathology, opening to the possibility of exploiting therapeutic strategies used in cancer to treat 
PAH.
It is now established that PAH cells react to a hostile environment with adaptive and cytoprotective responses, 
allowing them to survive and proliferate and leading to intense remodeling of distal PAs. Central to these strate￾gies are the over-activation of the DNA repair machinery8–10, the metabolic switch associated with resistance to 
mitochondrial-mediated cell death11, 12, the overexpression of molecular chaperones coping with the increasing 
number of misfolded proteins13, and the promotion of their clearance by autophagy14. Conversely, if stress stimuli 
go beyond a certain threshold, a variety of pro-apoptotic pathways culminating in cell death ensue, prevailing 
over the cytoprotective arms of the stress response. Thus, inhibiting these “over-efficient” stress coping mecha￾nisms offers the opportunity to selectively induce stress overload and reverse the proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
phenotype in PAH cells.

Accumulated evidence pointed to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as an important druggable stress surveil￾lance factor through its implication in multiple adaptive mechanisms aiming to prevent or cope with stress15–17. 
Contrary to nuclear HDACs implicated in epigenetic regulation of transcription, HDAC6 is a mainly localized 
cytoplasmic deacetylase involved in “non-histone” functions18. HDAC6 is overexpressed in many cancers and 
HDAC6 inhibitors display beneficial effects in various experimental models of cancer that shares several features 
with PAH19, 20. Importantly, HDAC6 does not deacetylate histones, and accordingly, the anticancer effects of 
the HDAC6-specific inhibitors are not associated with disrupted epigenetic control of gene transcription21. In 
directly influencing the acetylation status of several key cytosolic proteins16–18, 22, HDAC6 was reported to control 
numerous processes, impacting cell migration, proliferation and survival, all of which are important features of 
PAH1, 23. Indeed, HDAC6 promotes DNA repair and depletion or inhibition of HDAC6 sensitizes transformed 
cells to DNA damaging agents such as etoposide and doxorubicin24–26. Moreover, HDAC6 was reported to exert 
a protective role when cells are faced to stress in coordinating the clearance of misfolded protein aggregates prior 
to their engulfment in autophagosomes27, 28 and by preventing the translocation of apoptotic signaling proteins 
from the cytosol to the mitochondria16, 25. As a consequence, HDAC6 has emerged as a regulator of cell response 
to cytotoxic assaults. We therefore hypothesized that, as observed in many cancers, HDAC6 is overexpressed in 
PAH contributing to proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of PASMCs and that selective HDAC6 inhibition 
may represent a promising novel approach for the treatment of PAH.
Results
Increased expression of HDAC6 in human PAH and experimental models. Expression level of 
HDAC6 was measured by Western blot in lungs (n= 7–12) and distal PAs (n= 4–5) from control and PAH 
patients (Fig. 1A). As shown, HDAC6 was either not detected or barely detectable in lung tissues and distal 
PAs form control subjects, but was readily visualized in lung tissues from PAH patients. To confirm our results 
and identify the cell type responsible for augmented HDAC6 expression in human PAH lungs, we performed 
dual-immunofluorescence staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and HDAC6. We noted that immu￾noreactivity for HDAC6 was considerably stronger in the lungs from PAH patients compared to the control 
lungs with a marked increase in PASMCs from the remodeled distal pulmonary arteries, as observed by the high 
degree of overlap between these two staining patterns (Fig. 1B). Similar findings were observed in the MCT and 
Su/Hx models (Fig. 1C and D). To further substantiate our findings, we analyzed the expression level of HDAC6 
in primary cultured human PAH-PASMCs. In agreement with the above results, HDAC6 protein expression 
but not mRNA was robustly increased in PAH-PASMCs compared to control cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary 
Figure S1). Interestingly, the acetylation level of α-Tubulin, a substrate of HDAC618, was not changed between 
control and PAH-PASMCs (Supplementary Figure S1) suggesting that the increased activity of HDAC6 in these 
cells is counterbalanced by histone acetyltransferases as previously observed in other diseases29. In addition to 
PAH-PASMCs, HDAC6 was overexpressed in PAH-PAECs and PAH-RV as well as in the RV of rats exposed to 
Su/Hx and MCT (Supplementary Figure S1 and S2).
Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) regulates HDAC6 expression in PAH-PASMCs. To identify the 
mechanism responsible for HDAC6 overexpression in PAH-PASMCs, we focused our attention on HSP90. 
HSP90 is a central coordinator of an extensive array of cellular pathways upon stress through the stabilization 
of a wide range of proteins, which allows cells to survive and efficiently adapt to harmful conditions30. Given 
that HSP90 was recently found to be up-regulated in PAH13 and stabilizes HDAC6 in cancer cells13, 22, we thus 
hypothesized that the same mechanisms operate in PAH-PASMCs. We first measured HSP90 expression in iso￾lated PASMCs from control and PAH patients as well as distal PAs from MCT and Su/Hx rat models. As observed 
for HDAC6, HSP90 was up-regulated in human and experimental PAH (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the 
up-regulation of HSP90 accounts for HDAC6 stabilization and thus its overexpression in PAH-PASMCs, phar￾macological inhibition of HSP90 activity with AT13387 or 17-AAG or siRNA-mediated knockdown of HSP90 
was performed. AT13387 (Fig. 2B) or 17-AAG (Supplementary Figure S3) treatments dose-dependently reduced 
HDAC6 protein abundance, correlating with a progressive acetylation of α-Tubulin. Similarly, HSP90 silencing 
resulted in a significant decrease in HDAC6 protein expression in PAH-PASMCs when compared with scrambled 
siRNA (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that increased expression of HSP90 in 
PAH-PASMCs maintains HDAC6 protein abundance and activity.
HDAC6 inhibition recues the pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pro-migratory phenotype 
of PAH-PASMCs. The exaggerated migration, proliferation and survival of PASMCs is responsible for vas￾cular remodeling in PAH1
. Because HDAC6 has pro-migratory, pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions 
in various cancer cell types, we investigated whether HDAC6 contributes to these functions in PAH-PASMCs. 
To this end, in vitro loss-of-function approaches using molecular and pharmacological tools were conducted. 
Inhibition of HDAC6 activity in PAH-PASMCs was first achieved using Tubastatin A (TubA) and ACY-775, two 
pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC631, 32 as well as by small interfering RNA. PAH-PASMCs exposed to TubA 
or ACY-775 displayed a dose-dependent increase in the amount of acetylated α-Tubulin18 without affecting the 
total levels of α-Tubulin and the global degree of histone H3 acetylation, thus confirming the selectively of these 
inhibitors for HDAC6 (Supplementary Figure S4). Similar findings were observed following HDAC6 knockdown 
(Supplementary Figure S4). As expected, PAH-PASMCs had a significantly greater proliferation rate (as assessed 
by Ki67 labeling) and were more resistant to apoptosis (as assessed by Annexin V assay) when compared to 
control PASMCs. Inhibition of HDAC6 by TubA, ACY-775 or siHDAC6 significantly decreased PAH-PASMC 
proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure S4). Importantly, inhibition of HDAC6 
had no effect on control PASMCs (Fig. 3), indirectly validating our above findings showing that HDAC6 is not

or weakly expressed in these cells. Moreover, we found that pharmacological or molecular inhibition of HDAC6 
reduced PAH-PASMC migration, as assessed by scratch wound assay in vitro (Supplementary Figure S5).
HDAC6 inhibition causes Bax-induced cell death by increasing acetylation of cytosolic 
Ku70. We and others have previously demonstrated that mitochondria from PAH-PASMCs exhibit abnor￾malities rendering these cells less sensitive to apoptotic stimuli4, 11. Several cytosolic acetylated proteins have 
been identified as direct target of HDAC6. Among these, we paid particular attention to Ku70, a multifunc￾tional protein for which acetylation correlates with susceptibility to mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis16, 33, 34. To

demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibits Ku70 acetylation, enhancing Ku70-Bax binding and preventing stress-induced 
apoptosis, we first measured the acetylation level of Ku70 at lysine 539 (a critical acetylation site that influences 
Ku70-Bax binding)16, 34 in PAH-PASMCs exposed to HDAC6 inhibitors. As assessed by Western blots, TubA, 
ACY-775 and siHDAC6 treatments increased acetylation of Ku70 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), sug￾gesting Bax release and translocation to mitochondria. A similar finding was observed after inhibition of HSP90 
confirming our previous results showing that HSP90 promotes HDAC6 expression (Supplementary Figure S6). 
Because HDAC6 efficiently deacetylates K539 in vitro, we thus hypothesized that acetylation level of Ku70 is 
abnormally low in PAH cells. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the level of acetylated(K539)-Ku70 levels 
in human PAs from control and PAH patients. We found that the acetylated(K539)/total Ku70 ratio was reduced 
in PA cells from PAH patients compared to their normal counterparts (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate that inhibition 
of HDAC6 is accompanied by translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, serum-starved PAH-PASMCs treated 
or not with TubA or ACY-775 for 48 hours were subjected to immunofluorescence labeling for Bax and mito￾chondria were stained with MitoTracker Red. We found that consistent with our previous finding showing that 
inhibition of HDAC6 is associated with decreased resistance to apoptosis, inhibition of HDAC6 in PAH-PASMCs 
resulted in a greater colocalization of Bax with MitoTracker (Supplementary Figure S7). To further strengthen the 
role of HDAC6 in the context of Bax-mediated cell death, PAH-PASMCs were pre-treated with a cell permeable 
Bax-inhibiting peptide (BIP)-V5 designed from the Bax inhibiting domain of Ku7035 followed by HDAC6 inhi￾bition under starvation conditions. Pretreatment with BIP-V5 significantly rescued cells from apoptosis induced 
by HDAC6 inhibition, whereas no effect was detected with a negative control peptide (Fig. 4C). Taken together, 
these results indicate that HDAC6 protects PAH-PASMCs from stress-induced mitochondrial apoptosis through 
Ku70 deacetylation and sequestration of Bax in the cytosol.

Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 improves pulmonary hypertension in the Sugen/Hypoxia 
rat model and provides a therapeutic effect comparable to the combination of standard PAH 
therapies. To validate our in vitro findings, we performed in vivo studies in the Sugen/Hypoxia (Su/Hx) rat 
model to test whether treatment with TubA is able to reverse PAH. Once PAH establishment was echocardio￾graphically confirmed (five weeks post Sugen injection), TubA (25 mg/kg) was administered daily via intraperi￾toneal injection for two weeks (Fig. 5A). We demonstrated that TubA significantly improved RV systolic pressure 
(RVSP) and mean PA pressure (mPAP) in Su/Hx-treated rats, as assessed by right heart catheterization (Fig. 5B). 
Although not statistically significant, inhibition of HDAC6 tends to result in an increase in cardiac output (CO) 
and a decrease in right ventricular hypertrophy measured by Fulton index (Fig. 5B). Moreover, treatment with 
TubA resulted in a diminution of the total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR) (Fig. 5B). To enhance the trans￾lational potential of TubA, we compared the efficacy of TubA alone or in combination with currently approved 
PAH therapies, namely Macitentan and Tadalafil. We found that TubA alone provides similar therapeutic effects 
than a combination of Macitentan and Tadalafil (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we confirmed that TubA administration 
decreased HDAC6 activity in vivo by assessing acetylated(K539)-Ku70 levels in dissected PAs (Fig. 5C). To deter￾mine whether the improvement of the hemodynamic parameters was due to reduced vascular remodeling of 
distal pulmonary vessels, vascular wall thickness was quantified by hematoxylin and eosin staining and αSMA 
labeling. As expected, Su/Hx induced a severe vascular remodeling as evidenced by vascular wall thickening 
comprising majority of αSMA positive cells. Medial hypertrophy of distal pulmonary vessels was greatly reduced 
following HDAC6 inhibition (Fig. 6). Consistently, the percentage of occluded pulmonary vessels was signifi￾cantly lower in Su/Hx-treated rats given TubA than in those given vehicle (Supplementary Figure S8). We next 
validated our findings by measuring proliferation and apoptosis of distal PASMCs detected by αSMA labeling. 
In Su/Hx-challenged rats, proliferation of PASMCs was enhanced whereas virtually no apoptosis was detected as 
compared with controls. As observed in vitro, TubA suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in PASMCs 
(Fig. 6).

Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension in MCT 
rats. To further demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of TubA, we investigated whether the corrective effects 
observed in the Su/Hx model can be reproduced in a second model of PAH. As observed in the Su/Hx model, 
inhibition of HDAC6 with TubA significantly improved RVSP, mPAP, CO, TPR, RV hypertrophy, vascular remod￾eling (as assessed by medial wall thickness and percentage of occluded vessels) and cell proliferation/apoptosis 
imbalance in the MCT rat model (Supplementary Figure S9) reinforcing the view that HDAC6 is an essential 
component of vascular remodeling in PAH. Collectively, these results strongly support our hypothesis that 
HDAC6 promotes vascular remodeling in PAH and that its inhibition represents a new and promising avenue to 
tackle PAH.
Hdac6 loss of function in mice confers protection against chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary 
hypertension. To test whether HDAC6 constitutes a necessary factor for pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
development, wild-type (Hdac6Y/+) and Hdac6 knockout mice (Hdac6Y/−) were exposed to either normoxia or 
hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks. We first validated the absence of HDAC6 in mutant mice and demonstrated that 
hypoxia exposure significantly increased HDAC6 expression in lungs from Hdac6Y/+ mice (Fig. 7A). Contrary 
to our findings in human PAH and rat models, levels of HSP90 in whole lung homogenates were not increased 
by hypoxia (data not shown). As expected, loss of Hdac6 function in normoxic and chronic hypoxic mice was 
accompanied by the hyperacetylation of α-Tubulin and Ku70 (Supplementary Figure S10). From a hemodynamic 
point of view, chronic hypoxia induced PH in both Hdac6Y/+ and Hdac6Y/− mice (increased RVSP, mPAP, TPR 
and decreased CO) nonetheless; these effects were significantly attenuated in mutant mice (Fig. 7B). Note that no 
differences in all the hemodynamic measurements were seen between Hdac6Y/− and Hdac6Y/+ mice (Fig. 7B). A 
trend to a decrease in RV hypertrophy measured by Fulton index was also seen in mutant mice (Fig. 7B). Finally, 
Hdac6Y/− mice had reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling, as assessed by αSMA labeling (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
In the present study, we found that HDAC6 is strongly up-regulated in lungs, distal PAs and isolated PASMCs 
from PAH patients and animal models. In agreement with previous findings pinpointing HDAC6 as a regula￾tor of the cell protective responses15, we demonstrated that HDAC6 antagonizes apoptosis in PAH-PASMCs by 
maintaining Ku70 in a hypoactelyated state. Hypoacetylated Ku70 interacts with Bax and suppresses the apoptotic 
translocation of Bax to mitochondria, as shown in Fig. 8. More importantly, we demonstrated that its selective 
inhibition improved the pro-migratory, pro-proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype of PAH-PASMCs in 
vitro sparing control cells and significantly improved established PAH in two relevant rat models.
Although the overall status of histone modification is largely unknown in PAH, nuclear or pan-HDAC inhib￾itors have also been exploited in PAH for their beneficial effects under several pathophysiological conditions like 
cancer and inflammation36. These investigations have yielded mixed results. Indeed, studies conducted in rat 
models of PH have reported positive impact of class I HDAC inhibitor on pulmonary vascular remodeling and 
RV hypertrophy37, 38. These results contrast with those documenting no therapeutic effects of broad-spectrum 
HDAC inhibitors in the Su/Hx-induced PAH rat model or even a deterioration of RV function in a rat model of 
RV hypertrophy39, 40. The unresolved controversies highlighted by these studies may reflect, at least in part, the 
unforeseeable side effects caused by nuclear HDAC inhibitors. Unlike most classical HDACs, which are located in 
the nucleus and deacetylate nuclear histones, HDAC6 is predominantly localized within the cytoplasm where it 
associates with non-histone substrates18. Therefore, our findings demonstrating therapeutic benefit of Tubastatin 
A in PAH models combined to the fact that HDAC6 has limited and nonlethal implication in physiological 
processes41 and is minimally expressed in lung control cells make it a promising candidate towards therapeutic 
implementation in human PAH.

Similarly to the lungs, HDAC6 is up-regulated in the RV of both PAH patients and experimental rats models 
of PAH (Su/Hx and MCT). Although its role in RV failure was not explored in the present study, previous studies 
in heart failure revealed that HDAC6 promotes cardiac fibrosis42 and its inhibition was associated with cardiopro￾tective effects in a left ventricular pressure overload model43. This could thus explain the cardioprotective effects 
(better CO) of Tubastatin A in our models. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of 
HDAC6 in RV failure.
Consistent with a recent report13, we demonstrated that HSP90 expression is increased in human 
PAH-PASMCs as well as in two rat models of PAH leading to HDAC6 stabilization. Interestingly, analysis revealed 
that hypoxia exposure in mice was not accompanied, by significant change in HSP90 expression in whole lung 
homogenates, while HDAC6 being up-regulated. This finding indicate that hypoxia alone is not sufficient to 
up-regulate HSP90 and suggests that HDAC6 regulation by HSP90 relies more on its activity level rather than its 
expression level. Although HDAC6 up-regulation is a common denominator of human PAH and rat models, the 
differences in HSP90 expression among the PAH models underscore the need of exploring different models in the 
same study because none of the animal models fully recapitulate all aspects of the disease3
.
Our observations showing that inhibition of HDAC6 increases acetylation of Ku70 at lysine residue 539, 
known to abolish the ability of Ku70 to suppress Bax-mediated apoptosis34 and that Tubastatin A treatment 
enhances PAH-PASMC apoptosis, which is blocked by a Bax-inhibiting peptides derived from the Bax-binding 
domain of Ku70, strongly support the implication of Ku70 in vascular remodeling. These findings are in line 
with a previous study reporting that HDAC6 expression in neurobastoma cells maintains cytosolic Ku70 in a 
hypoacetylated state leading to Bax sequestration from the mitochondria and apoptosis evasion16. Interestingly, 
similar findings (increased HDAC6 and enhanced Ku70 acetylation in response to Tubastatin A) were found in 
PAH-PAECs suggesting the implication of HDAC6 in PAH-PAEC hyper-proliferation.

In addition to its cytoprotective functions in the cytosol, Ku70 is also involved in DNA double-stranded 
break and its acetylation level inversely correlates with its DNA repair efficiency44. Interestingly, Ku70 deficient 
mice exhibit lung abnormalities characterized by emphysema and blood vessel occlusions45, two conditions inti￾mately connected to defective DNA repair mechanisms and cell apoptosis. It is now well accepted that in the 
early stages of PAH, enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress and down-regulation of bone morphogenetic pro￾tein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) signaling cause irreversible accumulation of DNA damage and subsequent PAEC 
apoptosis46. During disease progression, sustained activation of the DNA repair machinery was identified as 
an adaptive response used by PAH cells to face stress, allowing them to survive and hyper-proliferate8, 9
. Thus, 
it can be assumed that endothelial cell overgrowth and development of plexiform-like lesions in Ku70 mutant 
mice is the consequence of initial apoptosis due to accumulation of DNA damage and subsequent selection of 
apoptosis-resistant proliferating cells. Although not explored in the present study, inhibition of HDAC6 in estab￾lished PAH may impair nuclear Ku70-mediated DNA repair function, contributing to decreased PAH-PASMC 
DNA repair capacity and thus diminished cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.
Our results identified cytosolic Ku70 as a target of HDAC6 promoting PAH-PASMC survival. However, sev￾eral other mechanisms mediated by HDAC6 could explain the abnormal pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic

phenotype of these cells. For instance, HDAC6 was reported to promote autophagy27 that is induced in human 
and experimental PAH14, 47. Although debated, autophagy is considered as a pro-survival mechanism against 
cellular stress, allowing removal of stress-induced damaged organelles and toxic protein aggregates48. In addition, 
HDAC6 interacts and deacetylates various other proteins including Survivin and HSP90 to carry out cancerous 
functions49, 50. Indeed, HDAC6 was reported to induce Survivin deacetylation promoting its cytoplasmic localiza￾tion and thus its anti-apoptotic functions50. Given that we previously demonstrated that Survivin is overexpressed 
in PAH-PASMCs contributing to the development of PAH7, 51, HDAC6 inhibition may also contribute to improve 
PAH by reducing the cytoplasmic pool of Survivin leading to increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Moreover, inhi￾bition of HDAC6 was reported to increase acetylation of HSP90 and thus weaken its chaperone-dependent func￾tions41, 49. Interestingly, HSP90 stabilizes various proteins associated with malignant growth and proliferation such 
as proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM-1), signal transducer and activator of tran￾scription 3 (STAT3) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)52, 53, also found to be increased and implicated 
in PAH6, 7, 11. Based on these findings, it can be assumed that HDAC6 overexpression in PAH-PASMCs favors 
HSP90 activity contributing to the proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotype of PAH-PASMCs. In agreement 
with this, inhibition of HSP90 was recently reported to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental 
PAH13. Nevertheless, as reported in cancer cells54, we found that Tubastatin A does not induce hyperacetylation 
of HSP90 in PAH-PASMCs (data not shown) indicating that the beneficial effects of HDAC6 inhibition seen in 
our models cannot be ascribed to a weakening of HSP90 function.
In conclusion, our results identify HDAC6 as a druggable regulator of PAH-PASMC resistance to apoptosis 
and offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing vascular remodeling. Importantly, HDAC6 has 
limited and nonlethal implication in physiological processes41 and phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating HDAC6 
inhibitors in cancer are currently ongoing (clinical trial NCT 01323751). Based on these findings, HDAC6 inhi￾bition represents a new and promising avenue to treat PAH, avoiding the unforeseeable undesirable side effects 
caused by non-specific nuclear HDAC inhibitors.
Methods
All experiments were performed with the approval of Laval University and the IUCPQ Biosafety and Ethics 
Committees, as well as in accordance with recent recommendations on optimal preclinical studies in PAH3
.
Human tissue samples. Experimental procedures using human tissues or cells conformed to the principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Tissues were obtained from patients who had previously given signed 
informed consent. Healthy lung tissues (controls) were obtained during lung resection for tumors. Lung samples 
Figure 8. Proposed model depicting the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC6 promotes vascular 
remodeling in PAH. To deal with stressful conditions, HSP90 is upregulated in PAH-PASMCs and stabilizes 
HDAC6. HDAC6 maintains cytosolic Ku70 in a hypoacetylated state preventing Bax translocation to 
mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. This results in increased cell survival contributing to vascular 
remodeling and PAH progression. Conversely, HSP90 or HDAC6 inhibition increases Ku70 acetylation and Bax 
release promoting mitochondrial membrane depolarization and programmed cell death.

were taken at distance from the tumor and demonstrated normal lung parenchyma. All the PAH tissues were 
from lung explants from transplant or early (“warm”) autopsy. PAH diagnosis was previously confirmed by right 
heart catheterization. PAH and control tissues were obtained from Respiratory Health Network tissue bank. PAH 
and control donor were matched for age and sex (Supplementary Table 1)3
. Keep in mind that although usage of 
human tissues is an invaluable resource, they are commonly obtained from patients with end-stage PAH only and 
non-PAH samples are rarely obtained from true healthy donors.
Reagents and inhibitors. ACY-775 (2-((1-(3-fluorophenyl)cyclohexyl)amino)-N-hydroxypyrimidine-5-
carboxamide) was obtained from Acetylon Pharmaceuticals. Tubastatin A (TubA) and 17-AAG (Tanespimycin) 
were purchased from SelleckChem. AT13387 (Onalespib) was purchased from AdooQ Bioscience. In some 
experiments, 200μM of Bax inhibitor peptide V5 (BIP-V5, MedChemExpress) or its corresponding control pep￾tide (Millipore) was applied 16hours before treatment with Tubastatin A or ACY-775.
Cell culture and treatments. PAH-PASMCs (n=5 cell lines) were isolated from small PAs (<1000 μm 
diameter) from PAH patients. Controls PASMCs (n=4 cells lines) were either purchased from Cell Application 
or isolated from non-PAH patients as previously described5, 8
. Cells were used at passages 4 to 9 for experi￾ments. No changes in cell morphology were noted and PASMC phenotype was confirmed by α-smooth mus￾cle actin staining, as previously done5, 8
. PASMCs were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% 
Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% antibiotic/antimytotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TubA 
and ACY-775 were dissolved first in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) and then added to the culture 
medium (0.15–2 μM) immediately before use. siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 20–100 nM 
with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
In vitro proliferation and apoptosis measurements. PASMCs were cultured for 48hours in 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS, a condition that is known to promote proliferation) or 0.1% FBS (a starvation condition 
that promotes apoptosis) in presence or absence of TubA, ACY-775, siHDAC6 or their respective controls. After 
treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20min. PASMC prolifer￾ation was measured by Ki67 labeling and apoptosis by AnnexinV assay, as previously performed5, 6, 8, 55. The total 
number of positive cells was calculated and divided by the total counter number of nuclei (DAPI), thus permitting 
the determination of percent values for each condition. At least 100 cells by experiment in 3 experiments were 
counted. All experiments were at least performed in triplicate.
Cell migration assay. PAH-PASMCs were grown to confluence. The cells were exposed or not to TubA, 
ACY-775, siHDAC6 or their corresponding controls for 24hours before a linear scratch was made using a ster￾ile 1000-μL pipette tip. Detached cells were removed by repeated washes and fresh medium containing or not 
HDAC6 inhibitors was added. Wound closure was monitored during 24 hours by phase microscopy captur￾ing images. Initial and remaining wound areas were determined with the aid of the image processing software 
«Image J» for calculation of the percentage of wound closure.
Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Total RNAs were extracted from control and PAH-PASMCs 
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), as previously described56. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a TaqMan 
RNA-to-CT 1-Step kit (Applied Biosystems) and a QuantStudio 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems). HDAC6 
expression was analyzed using the Taqman Gene Expression Assay (Assay ID Hs00997427_m1) from Applied 
Biosystems following the manufacturer directions. Reactions were run in triplicate and relative quantification was 
achieved with the comparative 2−ΔΔCt
 method by normalization with 18 s ribosomal RNA.
For Western blotting, protein lysates were prepared from healthy and PAH tissues or PASMCs in a 2% Chaps 
protein extraction buffer containing protease Inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails (Sigma). 
The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of 
protein were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with either 
5% non-fat dry milk or 10% goat serum in TBS-T buffer, then membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 
primary antibodies: HDAC6 (from Santa Cruz (1:100) for human samples and from Cell Signaling (1:1000) for 
rodent samples), Acetylated-α-Tubulin (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), α-Tubulin (Sigma, 1:5000), HSP90 (StressMarq, 
1:2000), acetyl(K539)-Ku70 (St John’s Laboratory, 1:1000), Ku70 (Santa Cruz, 1:1000), acetyl-Histone H3 (Cell 
Signaling, 1:1000) in 3% BSA. Next, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, 1:10000) for 2hours at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk 
or in 3% BSA. Antibodies were revealed using ECL reagents (Perkin–Elmer) and using the imaging Chemidoc 
MP system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein expression was quantified using the Image lab software (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) and normalized to Amido black (AB), as previously described5, 8, 56.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies. For in vitro localization of Bax, 
PAH-PASMCs serum-starved in 0.1% FBS and exposed or not to HDAC6 inhibitors for 48h were stained with the 
cell-permeable mitochondrion-selective dye MitoTracker Red (500nM, Life Technologies), fixed, permeabilized, 
and stained with antibody specific for Bax (Abcam, 1:150) Images were acquired using a Carl Zeiss MicroImaging 
microscope. Colocalization between Bax and MitoTracker was estimated by the software using an algorithm that 
calculates the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Paraffin-embedded lungs were serially sectioned at 5 µm. Following citrate-based antigen retrieval, the sec￾tions were blocked with goat serum (5%) for 1 hour. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies 
at 4 °C overnight. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HDAC6 (1:400, Abcam), anti-Ki67 (1:400, Millipore), and mouse 
monoclonal anti alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA, 1:200, Sigma) were used as primary antibodies. Proteins 
were detected using appropriate fluorescent-dye conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Apoptotis was detected by in situ direct DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) assay, according to manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. The Cyanine 3 Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit (PerkinElmer) was used for HDAC6 detection. Images 
were obtained with a Zeiss ApoTome microscope. The percentage of Ki67 or TUNEL-positive PASMCs was cal￾culated by examining 20 randomly selected distal pulmonary vessels (<50μm) from each of 5 to 11 rats from each 
experimental group, as previously described5, 8, 55.
Animal models. All animal protocols were approved by the Laval University and the IUCPQ Biosafety and 
Ethics Committes. The Sugen-hypoxia (Su/Hx) and the monocrotaline (MCT) PAH rat models were used in the 
present study. Male 250–350g Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) were used for both animal mod￾els. For the MCT model, rats were injected subcutaneously with 60mg/kg of monocrotaline (Sigma). For the Su/
Hx model, rats were injected with 20mg/kg of SU5416 (Sigma) and put in hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks. Once 
PAH was established (after 14 days for MCT and week 5 for Sugen and confirmed by echography), TubA (a spe￾cific HDAC6 inhibitor, 25mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) was intraperitoneally administrated every day for 2 weeks. 
Similarly, Macitentan (30mg/kg/day) and Tadalafil (10mg/kg/day) treatments were started 5 weeks after Sugen 
injection (once PAH was established) and were administered via gavage alone or in combination with TubA for 
2 weeks. Adult knock-out (Hdac6-/Y) mice (aged 8 to 10 weeks) and their control groups (C57BL/6 mice) were 
exposed or not to chronic hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks. Mice were genotyped by PCR, as previously described41.
In vivo assessment of pulmonary hypertension, RV hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular 
remodeling. At the time of sacrifice, rats and mice were initially anesthetized with 3–4% isoflurane and main￾tained with 2% during procedures. Hemodynamic parameters, including RV systolic pressure (RVSP), mean PA 
pressure (mPAP), cardiac output (CO) and total pulmonary resistance (TPR) were measured blindly by closed 
chest right heart catheterization (SciSence catheters), as previously described5, 8, 56. RV hypertrophy (Fulton 
index) was measured as the ratio of RV weight to left ventricular plus septal weight (RV/LV+S). Medial wall 
thickness of distal pulmonary vessels was quantified using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain or αSMA labe￾ling, by subtracting the area of the lumen from the total area of the vessel and reported as % of total pulmonary 
vessel area. Two measurements per vessel in 20 vessels per animal in at least 5 animals per group were performed. 
The percentage of occluded vessels was calculated by counting 50 vessels per animal, as previously described57.
Statistical analysis. Statistical tests and graphs were done with GraphPad Prism 6.0. Values are expressed 
as fold change or mean±standard error of the mean, as they followed a normal distribution. Unpaired Student 
t tests were used for comparisons between 2 groups, and 1-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer 
post test was used for >2 groups. If the variances of different groups were not equal and depended on the mean of 
the data, statistical analyses were performed on log transformation of the data. A significance level inferior to 5% 
(P<0.05) was considered statistically significant.
