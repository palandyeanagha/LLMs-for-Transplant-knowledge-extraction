I
nfection with hepatitis E viruses (HEVs) is one of 
the major causes of acute hepatitis in humans (1). 
Most HEV strains infecting humans belong to the 
virus species Orthohepevirus A (HEV-A) (2). HEV￾A comprises 8 genotypes; genotypes 1–4 and 7 are 
found in humans. HEV-A genotypes 1 and 2 seem to 
be restricted to humans. The other 3 genotypes have 
also been detected in animals, including pigs (geno￾types 3 and 4) and camelids (genotype 7) (1).
The most likely source of human zoonotic HEV in￾fection is consumption of contaminated food. Typically, 
human HEV infections lead to acute and self-limiting 
disease or asymptomatic seroconversion, but chronic 
hepatitis E has also been reported, mainly in trans￾plant recipients (3,4). Infection with camel-associated 
HEV-A genotype 7 was reported in a patient from the 
United Arab Emirates with chronic hepatitis after liver 
transplantation (4,5). This infection was likely acquired 
through consumption of contaminated camel products. 
Despite the risk for zoonotic transmission, data about 
shedding and immunity of HEV-A genotype 7 infection 
in naturally infected dromedaries are scarce.
The Study
We investigated HEV-A RNA and specific antibody 
levels in dromedary calves and corresponding dams 
from 1 farm at monthly intervals over the course of the 
calves’ first year of life. We included serum samples 
from 11 dam–calf pairs in the United Arab Emirates. 
The farm contained ≈4,500 camels. The 11 dam–calf 
pairs investigated in this study were kept in differ￾ent fenced compartments within 100–150 m of each 
other but were housed together with other dam–calf 
pairs in the same paddock throughout lactation (6). 
All calves were born during June 2014. Serum sam￾ples were obtained during the first week and then at 
monthly intervals until 1 year after birth.
We tested samples for HEV RNA by using 2 re￾verse transcription PCRs (RT-PCRs) and for HEV anti￾bodies by an HEV-A genotype 7 IgG ELISA (Appendix, 
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/9/19-1758-
App1.pdf). In the studied cohort, all calves were natu￾rally infected by HEV-A, as confirmed by RNA detec￾tion in serum samples, or seroconversion. In 9 of the 11 
calves (#1–#9) (Figure 1), HEV-A RNA was detected in 
>1 serum sample. In 2 calves (#10 and #11) no RNA was 
detected, but an increase in ELISA ratio, equivalent to 
seroconversion, confirmed recent HEV-A infection.
The average age for infection of calves was 4.6 
months (range 1–6 months). All HEV-A–RNA positive 
calves cleared the virus from their blood and showed 
accompanying seroconversion (Figure 1). Average vi￾remia was 2.1 months (range 1–4 months). Viral RNA 
concentrations in serum samples ranged from 6.6 × 102
IU/mL to 2.3 × 106
 IU/mL (mean 4.6 × 105
 IU/mL).

Orthohepevirus A genotype 7 is a novel zoonotic vari￾ant of hepatitis E virus. To clarify infection in the animal 
reservoir, we virologically monitored 11 dromedary dam–
calf pairs. All calves became infected during the first 6 
months of life and cleared the virus after an average of 2 
months. Dams did not become infected.

HEV RNA and Antibody Kinetics in Dromedary Calves
Phylogenetic analysis of partial open read￾ing frame 1 region sequences confirmed that all 
strains belong to HEV-A genotype 7 (Figure 2). Se￾quences described clustered with a clade of HEV-A 
sequences obtained from camels and a human pa￾tient, all from the United Arab Emirates. All new 
sequences were highly similar and had 0–3 nt ex￾changes in the 283-nt fragment, which is consistent 
with the epidemiologic link of all infections and 
might indicate a common source of infection on 
this farm.
We compared novel sequences with all other 
camel associated HEV-A genotype 7 sequences 
available in GenBank (as of June 1, 2019). The novel 
sequences differ by 6.0% to 20.6% nt content within 
the partial open reading frame 1 region.
We found that none of the corresponding serum 
samples from dams were positive for HEV-A-RNA at 
any time or showed seroconversion during the study. 
We also found that 6/9 dams showed reactivity at the 
time of parturition by using the applied HEV-A geno￾type 7 ELISA and remained reactive through the year,

and the other 3 dams remained nonreactive during 
the study.
ELISA reactivity for all calves decreased after infec￾tion, and 2 of the 11 calves became negative (#8 and #11) 
(Figure 1). These 2 calves were the ones that had earliest 
infection date and the longest time span between infec￾tion and last available serum sample. To what extent the 
decrease of antibody levels is associated with a decreas￾ing immunity against HEV-A genotype 7 was not inves￾tigated but should be the subject of future studies.
The observed natural course of HEV-A genotype 7 
infection in camels is similar to that for HEV-A geno￾type 3 in pigs. Pigs represent the zoonotic source of most 
human HEV infections in the Northern Hemisphere (7). 
In piglets, HEV-A genotype 3 infection usually occurs at 
the age of 2–3 months, coinciding with the decrease in 
levels of maternal antibodies (8). HEV-A RNA is pres￾ent in blood for ≈1 2 weeks, but longer periods <12 
weeks have been described (9). Similarly, in our study 
of camels, all calves became infected within the first 6 
months, and the duration of the viremia was an average 
of 8 weeks. Prevalence of HEV RNA in pigs at slaugh￾ter, which usually takes place at the age of 5–8 months, 
was found to be high, with <10% viral RNA detection in 
blood and <50% viral RNA detection in feces (7,10,11). 
As camels are slaughtered at higher age (≈2 years of age 
even in industrial farming) (12), a lower risk for HEV 
transmission associated with meat production might 
apply to camels in comparison with pigs.
The absence of RNA detection in dams suggests 
immunity in adult animals. The lack of detected HEV 
infection in 3 seronegative dams, despite close contact 
with their infected calves, points to additional fac￾tors, such as a T-cell–mediated immunity that might 
protect against HEV infection. This hypothesis is 
emphasized by simultaneous detection of antibodies 
and virus RNA in some calves and suggests that not 
all antibodies provide sterile immunity. This finding 
becomes essential when one considers intervention 
strategies, such as vaccination. Nevertheless, the time 
of seroconversion coincides with the time of decreas￾ing viremia and infection clearance. A similar pattern 
of virus versus antibody findings has been found for 
pigs, humans, and hares (8,13–15).

HEV RNA and Antibody Kinetics in Dromedary Calves
The observation that all investigated calves 
were infected in the first year of life indicates a 
highly active enzootic infection pattern. The virus 
seems to be widespread in the studied herd and 
could therefore be widely associated with drom￾edaries. Because calves have contact with other 
calves on farms, the infection cycle is probably 
maintained by calf-to-calf transmission. This fac￾tor is relevant because humans are rarely in contact 
with camel calves but make intensive use of adult 
animals and derived products. However, our study 
was conducted in an industrial farming context. 
Different infection patterns with infection at higher 
age might be observed in husbandries that involve 
lower densities of animals and might also vary in 
other husbandry practices.
Conclusions
We provide essential information regarding age of 
infection, virus shedding, and immunity for camel￾associated, zoonotic HEV-A genotype 7. Knowledge 
about the distribution of a zoonotic virus in its animal 
reservoir is needed to mitigate risks of acquisition 
along the husbandry and production chain. Interven￾tion by vaccination will need to target calves at a time 
when they are still coreared with dams. Risks for the 
general human population seem to be low because 
humans are rarely in contact with camel calves unless 
directly involved in camel breeding. Future studies 
should investigate age-associated infection patterns 
in less industrialized forms of camel husbandry and 
the actual risk for transmission to humans when ani￾mals are slaughtered.
