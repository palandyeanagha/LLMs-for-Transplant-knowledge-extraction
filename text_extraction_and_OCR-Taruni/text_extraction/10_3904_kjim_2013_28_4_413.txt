Background/Aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major cause of chronic liver 
disease in Korea, but viral prevalence has decreased because of hepatitis B 
vaccination programs. In this study, we investigated longitudinal changes in HBV 
in fection in the general Korean population.
Methods: HBV surface antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) seropositivity 
was assessed from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(I to V). In total, 50,140 subjects were tested for serum HBsAg positivity over a 
period of 12 years (1998 to 2010). 
Results: The prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity decreased over the study period. 
The rates of HBsAg carriers were 4.61% in 1998, 4.60% in 2001, 3.69% in 2005, 
3.01% in 2008, and 2.98% in 2010 (p < 0.0001). The reduction in HBV infection 
rates was more prominent in younger age groups. Among teenagers (10 to 19 
years), the percentage of HBsAg carriers decreased from 2.2% in 1998 to 0.12% 
in 2010 (p < 0.0001). Among those aged 10 to 39 years, the percentage of HBV 
infection decreased from 4.72% in 1998 to 2.29% in 2010 (p < 0.0001). However, 
no decreasing trend in HBsAg positivity was observed among those aged 50 or 
older (p > 0.05). Neither gender nor socioeconomic status were associated with the 
decreased prevalence of HBsAg carriers.
Conclusions: HBV infection has decreased in the Korean population since 
the advent of vaccination programs. However, the decrease is limited to the 
younger population, and viral persistence remains in the middle-aged and older 
population.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of acute 
hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepato￾cellular carcinoma (HCC) in South East Asia, China, 
and sub-Saharan Africa [1]. The prevalence of HBV 
infection in these regions ranges from 5% to 20% [2]. 
Seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
was estimated at 8% to 9% in males and 5% to 6% in 
females in the 1980s [3]. The introduction of hepa￾titis B vaccination has dramatically decreased acute 
and neonatal HBV infection in many countries. In 
Korea, universal vaccination of all infants has been 
performed since 1991 and nationwide strategies have 
been implemented since 1995 [4]. Prior to the intro￾duction of the vaccination program, approximately 8%

of the general Korean population was HBsAg-positive 
[5]. Following the introduction of HBV vaccination, 
HBsAg prevalence rates have decreased, from 10% in 
the 1980s to 3.8% in 2007 in the general population [6]. 
This rate decreased further, to 0.4% in teenagers and 
0.2% in children younger than 10 years [7]. Korea is 
now classified as an intermediate HBV endemic area (2
% to 7% prevalence) [6].
Although the prevalence of HBV has decreased, few 
epidemiological studies have investigated changes in 
HBV infection rates and the related demographic or 
environmental factors. Some Korean studies have been 
conducted using nonrepresentative or small samples 
from selected communities. Since 1998, a nationwide 
survey, named The Korea National Health and Nutri￾tion Examination Survey (KNHANES), has been con￾ducted. This survey is based on a representative sam￾ple of the entire population to provide national health 
and nutritional status statistics. Considering the ad￾verse effects of HBV on public health, the KNHANES 
has included serological markers for HBsAg and anti￾HBs.
In the present study, we investigated recent epidemi￾ological changes in HBV infection rates and related 
clinical and demographic factors. The results may be 
useful in establishing public health policies against 
HBV infection and its comorbidities in Korea.
METHODS
Subject
KNHANES is a cross-sectional national representative 
health and nutrition examination survey, conducted 
by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Preven￾tion. The survey uses a complex, stratified, multistage 
probability sample of the Korean population. The 
procedures for selecting the sample group and con￾ducting the interviews and examinations have been 
specified elsewhere (The Korean Association for Sur￾vey Research). The sample was selected in 11 metro￾politan cities and provinces (seven metropolitan cities, 
Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do/Gyeongsang-do, Chungc￾heong-do, Jeolla-do/Jeju-do) of Korea and systematic 
sampling was done to reflect characteristic of the pop￾ulation by region [8]. Trained research staff conducted 
a health interview, health consciousness and behavior 
survey, nutritional survey, and medical examination. 
The KNHANES database includes 50,140 serum sam￾ples that were analyzed from 1998 to 2010 (Table 1).
Laboratory evaluation
Serum samples were collected from subjects aged at 
least 10 years who completed the examination compo￾nent of the KNHANES. HBsAg tests were performed 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 
in 1998 and 2003 (CODA, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). 
Electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA) 
were conducted from 2005 to 2010 (E170, Roche Diag￾nostics, Basel, Switzerland). HBsAg titers greater than 
1 IU/mL were considered positive for HBV infection.
Data analysis and statistical methods
All sampling and weight variables were stratified. The 
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri￾angle Park, NC, USA) procedure was used for statistical 
analyses. To assess means, standard errors, and per￾centages, we used stratification variables and sampling 
weights designated by the Korean Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, based on the sample design of 
each survey year. The sampling weights were adjusted 
for nonresponses according to demographic factors 
after survey completion. The SAS Survey procedure 
was performed using clusters as a sampling-district 
variable. The chi-squared test was used to compare 
proportional differences among the 7 survey years. 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test was used to 
examine the linear effects of proportion among the 7 
survey years. All statistical analyses were conducted 
using the SUDAAN software version 10.0. Reported p 
values were two-tailed, and p values < 0.05 were con￾sidered to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Changes in prevalence of HBsAg carriers in Korean 
population
Table 1 presents the baseline clinical characteristics of 
the 50,140 participants. Overall HBsAg seropositivity 
was 4.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.06% to 5.16%) 
in 1998, 4.60% (95% CI, 3.96% to 5.24%) in 2001, 3.69%

(95% CI, 3.07% to 4.30%) in 2005, 3.72% (95% CI, 2.88% 
to 4.56%) in 2007, 3.01% (95% CI, 2.59% to 3.44%) in 
2008, 3.23% (95% CI, 2.67% to 3.78%) in 2009, and 2.98% 
(95% CI, 2.48% to 3.48%) in 2010. The prevalence of 
HBsAg carriers decreased over the study period (p < 
0.0001, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test) (Fig. 1). 
HBsAg carriers decreased across all surveys among 
both men and women (Table 1).
Changes in HBsAg seropositivity according to age 
group
The HBsAg-positive population markedly declined 
in younger age groups over the study period (1998 to 
2010) (Fig. 2). Among teenagers (10 to 19 years), preva￾lence decreased, from 2.2% in 1998 to 0.12% in 2010 (p 
< 0.0001) (Table 2). Among subjects aged 20 to 39 years, 
the prevalence of HBsAg carriers decreased signifi￾cantly (5.48% to 2.34% in 20s and 6.15% to 3.85% in 30s; 
p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). Among sub￾jects aged 40 to 49 years, the presence of HBsAg carri￾ers also decreased (5.43% in 1998 and 3.71% in 2010; p = 
0.0233). However, among subjects aged 50 years or old￾er, HBsAg seropositivity did not decrease throughout 
the study period (Table 2).
Changes in HBsAg seropositivity according to 
socioeconomic status
Table 3 summarizes the prevalence of HBsAg carriers 
according to household income and location of resi￾dency. Household income is classified into four sub￾groups. Each subgroup was calculated by income 
quartile to measure the average household income of 
residents, ranking them from poorest to wealthiest, 
and then grouping them into four income quartiles

(low, mid-low, mid-high, and high), each quartile con￾taining approximately 25% of the population [8]. A de￾crease in the prevalence of HBsAg carriers was ob￾served in all household income level subgroups. A 
similar pattern was observed in all studied locations 
(metropolitan, city, and rural area). Thus, household 
income and location did not affect HBV prevalence in 
the Korean population.
DISCUSSION
The population-based national survey (KNHANES) 
revealed a decreased prevalence of HBV infection in

the general Korean population over the last decade. 
The decrease in HBsAg carriers was more prominent 
in the younger population. Universal vaccination pro￾grams have contributed to the marked decline of HBV 
infection in subjects younger than 20 years (2.2% to 
0.12%). A similar decline in HBV infection rates was 
reported in Taiwan following its newborn vaccination 
program [9]. HBV vaccinations of newborns prevented 
the majority of perinatal transmission and reduced 
horizontal transmission to children born up to 6 years 
prior to the initiation of the program. In 1995, the Ko￾rean National Immunization Program for all neonates 
began to include universal vaccination for HBsAg, 
regardless of maternal HBsAg status. Since July 2002, 
newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers have been vacci￾nated as part of the hepatitis B prenatal transmission 
prevention program. HBV vaccine and hepatitis B 
immune globulin are simultaneously administered at 
two sites within 12 hours of delivery. The vaccination 
rate exceeds 90% of subjects and the prevention rate of 
vertical transmission is 90% to 95% [10,11].
This extensive and national effort reduced vertical 
and horizontal transmission of HBV within the popu￾lation. In the present study, we observed positive ef￾fects of the HBV vaccine, particularly in younger age 
groups.
The prevalence of HBsAg carriers also declined 
among those aged 30 to 39 years. The prevalence of 
HBsAg carriers decreased, from 6.15% to 3.85%, among 
those aged 30 years (p = 0.0002) and from 5.43% to 3.71% 
among those aged 40 years (p = 0.0233). The causes of 
these declines in HBV rates are unclear. Socioeconom￾ic status, including household income or location, did 
not significantly affect the rates of HBV decline. HBV 
vaccination likely played a role, but the universal neo￾natal HBV vaccination was not available to these specif￾ic age groups (30 to 49 years), and many of these individ￾uals were vaccinated during childhood and adolescence. 
The Korean government has conducted a mass catch up 
vaccination campaign since 1988, when school-aged 
children and adolescents were vaccinated [12]. HBV vac￾cines have been available commercially since 1983 [13], 
so private HBV vaccinations and herbal immunity 
may have contributed to the decline in HBV rates. The 
use of disposable syringes and razors and increased 
awareness about proper hygiene may also have con￾tributed to decreasing HBV infection rates.
Unsurprisingly, the prevalence of HBsAg positivity 
has remained unchanged in middle-aged and elderly 
populations. Although HBsAg-positive rates tend to 
decrease with aging, due to a natural loss of HBsAg 
[14], the overall trends in HBV infection were unaffect￾Table 3. Hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity according to socioeconomic status from 1998 to 2010 in Korea

ed. This suggests that the risk for HBV-related cirrho￾sis or HCC in the elderly population may not decrease 
for some time. Recent national cancer statistics have 
confirmed that the incidence of HCC in Korea has not 
declined in the elderly population: 13,126 in 2000 and 
15,936 in 2009 [15]. In contrast, HCC rates among chil￾dren who received HBV vaccinations declined rapidly 
[16].
Screening programs to detect HBV infection in the 
general adult population should therefore be main￾tained. Screening, defining high-risk subjects, and 
providing optimal antiviral treatment are also impor￾tant to reduce mortality and morbidity from chronic 
HBV infection.
This study had some limitations. First, bias from 
the self-reported questionnaire cannot be excluded. 
Second, HBsAg detection methods differed between 
KNHANES I, II, III, IV, and V. An automated enzyme 
immunoassay (ELISA; Bio-Rad Elite microplate) was 
used in surveys I and II, whereas an ECLIA was used 
in later tests. Enzyme immunoassays are reliable and 
easy to perform for mass screening programs, and 
display a high level of performance [17,18]. The ECLIA 
is an additional highly sensitive and specific screening 
assay for HBsAg, including HBV mutants [19], and is 
widely used in HBsAg screening. The sensitivity of 
ELISA and ECLIA testing is over 99% [20] and the con￾cordance rate between the two methods is reportedly 
as high as 97% [21]. Although the methods used in 
KNHANES have not been compared directly, differ￾ences in HBsAg sensitivity are likely to be minimal.
 In summary, HBV infection rates have decreased 
since the adoption of HBV vaccination programs in 
Korea. The dramatic reduction of HBV infection is 
more prevalent in the younger population. Among 
subjects aged 30 to 49 years, HBV infection decreased 
over the 12-year study period, while the overall preva￾lence of HBsAg carriers remains around 4%. Addi￾tionally, HBV infection remains prevalent in the older 
Korean population (≥ 50 years). Thus, the detection of 
HBV infection, optimal antiviral treatment, and cost￾effective surveillance strategies are still required for 
the middle-aged and elderly Koreans where HBV 
prevalence remains high.
