INTRODUCTION: Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS-VI) is caused 
by a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase activity, 
resulting in lysosomal accumulation of partially degraded gly￾cosaminoglycans (GAGs). Compressive myelopathy in early-on￾set MPS-VI patients has been partly attributed to thickening of 
the dura mater following engorgement with GAG. In this study, 
we therefore tested whether the dural abnormalities could be 
prevented in a feline model of the disorder.
RESULTS: All intrathecal injections (IT-INJs) were well toler￾ated. MPS-VI cats treated with IT-INJ of recombinant human 
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (rhASB) exhibited reduced 
vacuolation in the dural fibroblasts, diminished levels of sulfated￾N-acetylhexosamine (HNAc(+S)) in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and no hind-limb paresis. Serum anti-rhASB antibodies 
remained low in MPS-VI cats treated with intravenous enzyme 
replacement therapy (IV-ERT) and increased slightly in normal 
cats treated with IT-INJ of rhASB alone. Anti-rhASB antibodies in 
CSF remained undetectable.
DISCUSSION: These data indicate that repeated IT-INJ of rhASB 
can safely prevent GAG storage in MPS-VI dura.
METHODS: Cats were assigned to three groups: (i) receiving 
weekly IV-ERT of rhASB from birth plus six monthly IT-INJs of 
rhASB from age 2 months; (ii) receiving six monthly IT-INJs of 
vehicle; or (iii) untreated. Additional normal cats received five 
fortnightly IT-INJs of rhASB or vehicle alone.
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS-VI; Maroteaux–Lamy syn￾drome) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defi￾ciency in N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ASB; EC 3.1.6.1) 
activity. Mutations within the ASB gene produce a loss of 
functional ASB activity leading to progressive lysosomal accu￾mulation of dermatan and chondroitin sulfates and progressive 
functional impairment of multiple organs, yielding MPS-VI in 
humans and mammals, including cats (1). Early-onset MPS-VI 
patients are usually diagnosed by 2 years of age, and progres￾sive clinical features include major skeletal abnormalities (short 
stature, dysostosis multiplex), joint stiffness and degenerative 
joint diseases, cardiomyopathy and valvular dysfunction, upper 
airway obstruction, and corneal clouding. Death in late child￾hood to early adulthood often occurs, but patients with later￾onset MPS-VI can live into their forties and fifties, usually with 
progressively worsening symptoms.
Compressive myelopathy leading to leg paresis is common in 
patients with early-onset MPS-VI consequent to vertebral bone 
deformities, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and/or thicken￾ing of the dura mater (2–5). Spinal cord compression in MPS-VI 
can develop early, and, as with other MPS including MPS-I, 
MPS-II, and MPS-IV, surgical interventions are often required 
to alleviate neurological signs (4–7).
Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (IV-ERT) with 
recombinant human ASB (rhASB) is now considered a safe 
therapy for MPS-VI and provides short- and longer-term ben￾efits (8,9). Phase II/III clinical trials showed sustained improve￾ments in walking and climbing endurance in most patients 
treated with IV-ERT for 97–260 weeks (9). However, these were 
less pronounced in patients with advanced skeletal disease at the 
start of the trials (9). Complementary therapeutic approaches 
require investigation to lessen the risk of developing spinal cord 
compression and paresis in the most affected MPS-VI patients 
receiving IV-ERT.
In the MPS-VI cat, IV-ERT from birth effectively improves 
pathology in various tissues, including heart valves, aorta, 
bones, liver, and kidney (10,11). Although articular cartilages do 
not benefit from intravenously administered rhASB due to their 
avascular nature, they nevertheless show significant improve￾ment when rhASB is injected directly into the joint spaces 
(12,13). Similarly, neuroparenchyma outside the blood–brain 
barrier does not benefit from recombinant enzyme adminis￾tered systemically at a standard dose, with vacuolation evident 
in dura mater of MPS-VI cats treated weekly with 1 or 2mg/kg
rhASB from birth to 6 months of age (11). In a pilot study 
using mature MPS-VI cats tolerant to rhASB, a short course of

intrathecal therapy was effective at reducing lysosomal storage 
in dura mater chronically altered by the disease process (14).
In this study, we report the impact of early commencement 
of intrathecal rhASB therapy in young MPS-VI cats receiving 
IV-ERT. We also tested whether adverse events develop fol￾lowing repeated intrathecal injections (IT-INJs) of rhASB in 
immunocompetent normal cats.
Results
Immune response toward rhASB
Of eight A/E6 cats, two remained seronegative throughout the 
study; three had a single low-positive response (dilution fac￾tor (DF) <90); three had persistent low anti-rhASB antibody 
responses (DF ranging between 90 and 810); two N/E5 cats 
had significantly elevated serum anti-rhASB titers toward the 
end of therapy (maximum DF: 2430 and 7290); the third N/5 
cat remained seronegative; serum anti-rhASB antibody titers 
in all A/V6, N/V6, and N/E6 cats were below or near the limit 
of detection of the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay 
(i.e., DF ≤30). All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples exhibited 
anti-rhASB antibody titers below or near the limit of detection 
of the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (i.e., DF ≤30).
Safety of IT-INJ
Repeated IT-INJ and general anesthesia did not affect feline 
growth (Figure 1). The majority of cats treated with IT-INJ 
did not show any noteworthy clinical abnormalities during the 
study: cat N/E5-2 became febrile 1 day after IT-INJ#3, and cat 
N/V6-1 had mild neurological deficit after IT-INJ#5; both ani￾mals recovered with supportive treatment and tolerated subse￾quent IT-INJs without incident. Neither incident was attributed 
to rhASB administration. Small focal sites of mild Wallerian 
degeneration, resembling those reported previously (14), were 
observed in the brainstem and first spinal cord segment near 
the site of injection across all animal groups receiving IT-INJ 
of rhASB or vehicle (with or without polysorbate-80). Absence 
of inflammation in the majority of CSF samples in intrathe￾cally treated cats correlated with the absence of inflammation 
in the brain, spinal cord, and dura at the end of the study; in a 
few CSF samples, there were erythrocytes attributed to iatro￾genic hemorrhage (red blood count range: 0–282,000 × 106
/l). 
In the CSF sample collected 1 day after IT-INJ#5 in one normal 
cat that seroconverted (N/E5-1), there were elevated nucleated 
cells (including activated macrophages) (nucleated cell count: 
280 × 106
/l), reactive pleocytosis, hemosiderophages, and bor￾derline elevation in protein concentration (0.32 g/l), which 
may have been due to slight blood contamination (red blood 
count: 8,350 × 106
/l); however, inflammation was not detected 
in histological sections of cerebrum, cerebellum, and dura.
Efficacy of IT-INJ
Measurements of dural thickness showed large intra- and inter￾sample variability. Overall ranges were 92–327, 54–223, and 
19–131µm for the thicker, intermediate, and thinner parts of the 
sections, respectively. Thicker samples were among the normal 
cats, and thinner samples were among the A/V6 cats (data not 
shown). Initial qualitative evaluation (unblended) of the dura 
confirmed the absence of vacuolation in normals (Figure 2a,b) 
and indicated a general improvement in tissue appearance in 
samples obtained from most A/E6 cats compared with A/V6 
and A/0 cats (Figure 2c–f). To confirm these observations, a 
veterinary histopathologist subsequently examined the dura 
samples in a blinded manner. A score system rating the extent 
of vacuolation from 0 to 4 (no to severe vacuolation) showed a 
marked trend toward less vacuolation in dura samples of A/E6 
cats compared with A/V6 or A/0 cats (Table 1).
Sulfated-N-acetylhexosamine (HNAc(+S)) concentration in 
CSF indicated a significant group × time interaction (P < 0.0001) 
for the three groups of cats (i.e., group 1: all normal cats; group 2: 
A/E6 cats; group 3: (A/V6 + A/0) cats) (Figure 3): the (A/V6 + 
A/0) cats were significantly different (P < 0.0001) from the nor￾mal cats at all time points; the A/E6 cats were significantly differ￾ent (P < 0.003) from (A/V6 + A/0) cats at all time points except 
time 0; and A/E6 cats were significantly different (P < 0.05) from 
normal cats at all time points except at 70 days of intrathecal 
therapy (Figure 2).
A clear reduction in vacuolation was evident in the dura of 
one MPS-VI cat (A/E6-8) 23 days after IT-INJ#4 (i.e., up to 107 
days of intrathecal therapy when early withdrawal was neces￾sary due to severe anemia/icterus) (Figure 2g,h) along with 
low levels of HNAc(+S) in the final CSF sample (see 107-day 
time point in Figure 3). Although these observations should 
be interpreted with caution due to the poor health of the cat, 
they suggest that substantial re-accumulation of storage did 
not occur in that period.

Intrathecal enzyme reduces dural storage Articles
Response to IV-ERT
No abnormalities were observed during or immediately after 
each IV-ERT. Cat A/E6-7 was the only male in this group that 
did not exhibit an overall weight gain (Figure 1a). Body weights 
of the other four A/E6 males remained lower than normal 
males from 3.5 months; N/0 males grew slightly better than N/
V6, N/E6, and N/E5 males; A/V6-2 exhibited weight gain sim￾ilar to normal females (Figure 1b). A/E6-8 grew until 150 days 
of age, after which signs of lethargy, fever, icterus, and anemia 
became evident and required early study withdrawal at 167 
days of age (i.e., 23 days after IT-INJ#4); although the Coombs 
test was positive, hemolytic anemia was excluded at necropsy, 
and hepatitis and splenitis were recorded. No health problems 
(unrelated to MPS-VI) or macroscopic pathology was detected 
in other cats in this study. A/0 and A/V6 developed characteris￾tic features of MPS-VI (dwarfism, coarse facies, joint stiffness, 
and gait abnormalities). A/0-1 and A/0-2 were euthanized at 
137 and 146 days of age, respectively, due to grooming difficul￾ties and paresis. Multiple spinal cord compressions were found 
in A/0-1; a single compression site was detected in A/0–2. 
Similarly, A/V6-1 was euthanized at 173 days of age (2 days 
after IT-INJ#5) due to multiple spinal cord compressions lead￾ing to severe paresis and grooming difficulties.
At the study end, no skeletal or joint abnormalities were vis￾ible on radiographs of normal cats. The A/0 and A/V6 cats 
exhibited a moderate degree of generalized epiphyseal dys￾plasia and osteopenia, with degenerative joint disease resem￾bling the radiographical abnormalities observed in young, 
untreated MPS-VI cats (10,11). Similarly, the radiographic 
improvements seen in eight A/E6 cats at the end of the study 
were comparable to those reported in young IV-ERT MPS-VI 
cats treated from birth (10,11). Although the dimensions 
and shape of most long bones and lumbar vertebrae were 
improved in the A/E6 cats as compared with A/V6 and A/0 
cats, no skeletal disease features were completely normalized. 
Moreover, urinary GAG levels in A/E6 cats were lower than 
those in A/0 cats and in cat A/V6-1 but did not reach the low 
levels found in normal cats, confirming previous observations 
(data not shown) (10,11).
Discussion
IT-INJ of rhASB was well tolerated with no adverse events 
related to the enzyme preparation, vehicles or diluent, confirm￾ing our previous findings of the safety of IT-INJ in two mature 
immunotolerized MPS-VI cats (14). Histological examination 
of dural sections from four different anatomical sites showed an 
unequivocal tendency toward reduced vacuolation in MPS-VI 
cats treated with monthly IT-INJ of 0.5mg/kg rhASB compared 
with those treated with IT-INJ with vehicle, untreated MPS-VI 
cats, and historical MPS-VI cats treated with IV-ERT alone 
from birth (11). A comparable decrease in dura vacuolation was 
reported in MPS-I dogs treated at different intervals (i.e., weekly, 
monthly, or quarterly) with IT-INJ of recombinant human α-L￾iduronidase (15,16).
Histological observations of vacuolation matched reductions 
in CSF HNAc(+S) in MPS-VI cats treated with rhASB IT-INJ. 
We have reported that CSF HNAc(+S) in two MPS-VI cats 
treated weekly with IT-INJ of rhASB normalized after 1 week 
of therapy (17).
Although the final observations made in one MPS-VI cat 
withdrawn from the study 23 days after IT-INJ#4 need to be 
interpreted with caution due to its poor health, they suggest 
that 3 weeks is necessary for substantial re-accumulation of 
lysosomal storage to occur within the dura. Indeed, reduced 
vacuolation was observed within this cat’s dura, and a low 
HNAc(+S) level was measured in the CSF sample collected 
before necropsy. Thus, the amount of HNAc(+S) in CSF mea￾sures a therapeutic response to this therapy in cats.
In MPS-I dogs treated intrathecally with iduronidase, spinal 
meningeal GAG storage was reduced by 58–70% as compared 
with untreated dogs (15). Three months after the last IT-INJ of 
iduronidase, no reduction in vacuolation was observed in the 
neocortical meningeal cells, although a 73% reduction in GAG 
in the spinal meninges was still detected (15,16). Although 
useful for screening and monitoring total urinary GAG, dye

methods often lack precision (16) and are impractical for 
CNS tissue analysis because samples are obtained at necropsy. 
Measurement of oligosaccharide fragments in CSF by tandem 
mass spectrometry offers a sensitive and specific approach for 
monitoring therapeutic efficacy (17–19).
Although lysosomal storage has been reported in a few 
neurons and glia in the cerebral cortex of MPS-VI cats, CNS 
impairment is not usually associated with MPS-VI and, accord￾ingly, in this study, the clearance of storage material within 
neural cells was not examined (20). Consistent with our previ￾ous intrathecal therapy study, analysis of dural thickness was 
inconclusive owing to large intra- and intersample variability, 
possibly reflecting difficulties in obtaining the correct tissue ori￾entation during embedding and sectioning (14). Nevertheless, 
the few MPS-VI cats that were not treated intrathecally with 
rhASB generally had thinner dura than the normal cats, which 
does not support the hypothesis that dural thickening plays an 
etiological role in the young feline MPS-VI paresis model. In 
MPS-VI humans, observations made during diagnostic imag￾ing, surgery, and autopsy have shown that dural thickening at 
the cervical level can contribute to compressive myelopathy 
(2–5). Advances in medical imaging techniques have led to 
major improvements in evaluating dural thickness in humans 
(21,22).
No spinal cord compression site was seen in any cat treated 
with IT-INJ and IV-ERT of rhASB, whereas multiple or single 
spinal cord compression sites were detected in three of five 
untreated MPS-VI cats. This is consistent with observations 
that vertebral shapes are improved, and vertebral canal stenosis 
is prevented, with weekly IV-ERT initiated at an early age. It is 
possible that the reduction in lysosomal storage within the dura 
mater leads to improvement in tissue characteristics unrelated 
to thickness, such as stiffness and elasticity, and that this subse￾quently prevented the development of compressive force around 
the spinal cord; however, changes in these parameters remain to 
be demonstrated.
The low stable level of anti-rhASB antibodies in serum col￾lected at various times before or after systemic and intrathe￾cal administration of rhASB in MPS-VI cats, and the absence 
of anti-rhASB antibodies in CSF collected before each IT-INJ 
and at the end of the study in these cats, confirm a state of 
immune tolerance toward rhASB similar to that observed 
in other MPS-VI cats treated with IV-ERT alone from birth

Intrathecal enzyme reduces dural storage Articles
(10,11). Hypersensitivity reactions at the time of IV-ERT and/or 
at monthly IT-INJ of rhASB were not observed in the MPS-VI 
cats, indicating that, together with antibody data, the combined 
IV-ERT and IT-INJ therapy is safe. The capacity to quickly 
mount an immune response toward intrathecally administered 
rhASB was seen in two/three normal cats, supporting our pre￾vious observation that some immunocompetent normal cats 
do not develop anti-rhASB antibodies following exposure to 
rhASB (14). In two normal cats that seroconverted, the humoral 
immune response mounted within 2 months was mild, indi￾cated by a relatively low elevation in serum anti-rhASB anti￾bodies, the absence of CSF anti-rhASB antibodies, the absence 
of inflammation in the CNS tissues, and the few inflammatory 
cells detected in only one CSF sample obtained after IT-INJ#5. 
It is possible that the immune response might have intensified 
over time and that adverse events (such as meningitis) might 
have developed if fortnightly IT-INJs of rhASB had been con￾tinued over the following months in these normal cats. MPS-I 
dogs treated intrathecally with recombinant human iduronidase 
developed serum and CSF antibodies against the enzyme, as well 
as meningitis (15,16). Similarly, intrathecally treated MPS-IIIA 
dogs developed antibodies against recombinant human sulfami￾dase, as well as meningitis (23), whereas MPS-IIIA mice treated 
with repeated IT-INJs of the same enzyme developed circulating 
antibodies without meningitis or adverse reactions (24–26).
The small, focal, Wallerian-type degeneration observed near 
the site of IT-INJ in most intrathecally treated cats, irrespec￾tive of presence or absence of polysorbate-80, was attributed to 
mild iatrogenic trauma produced during IT-INJ, as previously 
reported (14), again highlighting the importance of a good 
injection technique (14). The lumbar region (L4–L5 space) has 
been used for IT-INJ of recombinant enzyme in MPS-I and 
MPS-VI patients (27,28); ultrasound guidance will likely be 
used to localize the subarachnoid space for precise delivery of 
enzyme into the CSF. The phenotypic improvements observed 
in the rhASB-treated MPS-VI cats in this study, such as 
increased bone length, reduced kyphosis, and improved facial 
appearance were attributed to the early initiation of weekly 
IV-ERT, again confirming its efficacy (10,11). Even when 
weekly IV-ERT of 1mg/kg rhASB is commenced at birth, some 
features of MPS-VI remained detectable, e.g., shorter, stiff neck 
and mild facial abnormalities, and some variations in response 
are observed due to phenotypic variation. As expected, corneal 
clouding and degenerative joint diseases continued to develop 
in the IV-ERT MPS-VI cats due to poor vascularization of these 
sites. This study has demonstrated that local injections of rhASB 
benefit tissues not normally accessed by systemically adminis￾tered rhASB. Indeed, direct injection of rhASB into the CSF 
bypasses the blood–brain barrier and improves the appearance 
of the dura mater. Similarly, direct injection of rhASB into joint 
spaces circumvents the lack of vascularization and improves the 
appearance of the articular cartilage (12,13).
In summary, monthly IT-INJ of rhASB was well tolerated in 
MPS-VI cats receiving weekly IV-ERT from an early age and led 
to substantial reductions in lysosomal storage within the dura 
mater and HNAc(+S) concentration in serial CSF samples. These 
results were similar to those found in mature immunotoler￾ized MPS-VI cats (14) and support the contention that repeated 
IT-INJ is a safe and efficacious means of regularly administering 
enzyme into the CNS in MPS-VI and other lysosomal storage 
disorders for which development of paresis needs to be prevented 
(6,7) or in which brain function is impaired (16,23–25,28,29).
Methods
Enzyme Preparation
BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA) provided rhASB (14). The 
vehicle solution used with rhASB for monthly IT-INJ contained 
10mM sodium phosphate and 150mM sodium chloride with 
0.025% (vol/vol) polysorbate-80. A second vehicle solution without 
polysorbate-80 was used for fortnightly IT-INJs. The pH of rhASB 
and vehicle preparations was 5.8. The concentration of rhASB was 
1mg/ml and 5mg/ml for IV-ERT and IT-INJ, respectively. Before 
each IT-INJ, one volume of rhASB (or equivalent volume of vehicle) 
was diluted with two volumes of Elliott’s B solution (QOL Medical, 
Seattle, WA).
Test Animals
Cats were bred and maintained at the Institute of Medical and 
Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia, as previously described 
(10,11). All studies were reviewed and approved by the Women’s and 
Children’s Hospital and Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science 
animal ethics committees.
MPS-VI Diagnosis
Histological assessment of blood smears at birth and genotyping were 
performed as described (11,14,18). The severe clinical MPS-VI pheno￾type (L476P homozygous) used in this study is associated with a low 
level of feline ASB protein (18).
IV-ERT, IT-INJ, and Sampling
Eight MPS-VI (A/E6) and three normal (N/E6) cats received weekly 
IV-ERT of 1mg/kg rhASB usually starting within the first 24 hours 
after birth, plus a total of six IT-INJs of 0.5mg/kg rhASB adminis￾tered once monthly from 2 months of age. IT-INJs were given via the 
cisterna cerebellomedullaris (cisterna magna). No other cat received 
IV-ERT. Three normal cats (N/E5) received a total of five IT-INJs 
of rhASB at 2-week intervals from 2 months of age. Three normal 
(N/V6) and two MPS-VI cats (A/V6) received a total of six IT-INJs of 
vehicle (containing polysorbate-80), once per month from 2 months 
of age. Two additional normal cats received a total of five IT-INJs of 
vehicle (without polysorbate-80) (N/V5) at 2-week intervals from 
7 months of age. Three untreated MPS-VI (A/0) and two normal 
kittens (N/0) were controls. The IT-INJ technique used was similar 
to that described with all IT-INJs administered under general anes￾thesia (14). Each IT-INJ was administered at 117–285μl/min over a 
3–5min period. A treatment summary is presented in Table 2. CSF 
samples were collected before each IT-INJ and before euthanasia (i.e., 
1–3 days after the last IT-INJ). Blood was collected before IV-ERT 
and IT-INJ, and occasionally minutes after the IT-INJ. From 6 weeks 
of age onward, antihistamines were administered at least 30min prior 
to each IV-ERT (13).
Health assessments included regular monitoring for hypersensitiv￾ity reactions, weight gain, gait abnormalities, blood and urine analysis, 
and final standardized radiographs (14).
Analysis of CSF Samples and Cytology
CSF was collected and processed for immediate cytospin, cell count, 
smear evaluation, and measurement of protein concentration, antibody 
titers, and oligosaccharide fragments (14). Anti-rhASB antibodies in 
serum and CSF were detected using a bridged electrochemiluminescence

immunoassay as described previously (14,30). Titers were reported as 
the maximum sample DF that yields a positive result. Samples that 
were not confirmed positive at the minimum DF of 30 were indicated 
as being below the limit of detection. Differences in titers within 10-fold 
were not considered significant.
HNAc(+S) in CSF and Statistical Analysis
HNAc(+S) was determined in CSF as described (17). A linear mixed 
model was run on the CSF levels over time, with group, time, and 
the interaction as predictors. A compound symmetric covariance 
structure was used. Before running the full model, a test of the equal￾ity of two groups of normal cats (group (N/V6 + N/V5 + N/0) and 
group (N/E5 + N/E6)) was run. Once equality was established, the 
mixed model was run with the two normal groups collapsing into 
one single group: group 1. The A/E6 cats formed group 2; the A/0 
and A/V6 cats formed group 3. Group differences were tested at 0, 
28, 56, 70, 84, 112, 140, and 142 days, and the P values for these com￾parisons were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm’s step￾down procedure (31).
Urinary Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
Urine was collected at least monthly, and total GAG was analyzed (13).
Euthanasia, Tissue Collection, and Pathological Evaluation
Most IT-INJ-treated cats (14 of 21) were euthanized at 7 months of age 
(1–3 days after their last IT-INJ) using a barbiturate overdose. However, 
cat A/E6-8 was euthanized at 5 months of age due to severe anemia/
icterus; cat A/V6-1 was euthanized at 6 months of age due to severe 
paresis; three N/E5 cats were euthanized at 4 months of age; and two 
N/V5 cats were euthanized at 9 months of age. Cats A/0-1, A/0-2, and 
A/0-3 were euthanized at 4.5, 7, and 5 months of age, respectively. A 
wide range of tissues was collected, including brain, spinal cord, and 
dura mater from four levels (cerebrum, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar). 
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded, 
and 6-µm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 
Two veterinary pathologists independently examined the sections. 
Dura samples were processed and embedded in Epon-Araldite, and 
semi-thin (1μm) toluidine blue–stained sections were evaluated for 
clearance of lysosomal storage (14,18).
