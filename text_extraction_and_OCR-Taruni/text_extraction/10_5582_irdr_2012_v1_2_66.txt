1. Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune-mediated 
chronic progressive inflammatory liver disease 
resulting in chronic cholestasis, portal inflammation, 
and fibrosis that can lead to cirrhosis and, ultimately, 
liver failure. PBC, predominantly affecting middle￾aged women, is characterized by biochemical markers 
of cholestasis, the presence in serum of highly 
specific antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), and 
histologically progressive destruction of intrahepatic 
bile ducts (1-4). The most frequent symptoms in PBC 
are fatigue and pruritus, occurring in up to 85% and 
70% of patients, respectively (5,6).
 Although numerous studies have revealed that 
environmental factors, inherited genetic predispositions 
and loss of tolerance appear to contribute to its 
autoimmune pathogenesis, the actual impact of these 
factors is still controversial (7).
 Median survival in untreated individuals had 
been reported to be 7.5 to 16 years (1,8), however, 
it has largely improved since the introduction of 
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy and liver 
transplantation (9-12). Early recognition of the disease 
with serological tests and treatment with UDCA at an 
early stage of the disease has not only enabled patients 
to enjoy equivalent life expectancy to that of the normal 
population, but also dramatically decreased the need 
for orthotopic liver transplantation (13,14). However, 
the beneficial mechanisms of UDCA treatment are 
still incompletely understood, since about one third 
of patients fail to adequately respond to UDCA 
monotherapy, and liver transplantation is still a last 
resort for those with end stage PBC (2). While the 
outcome of liver transplantation for PBC is excellent, 
Summary Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic progressive inflammatory 
liver disease, predominantly affecting middle-aged women, characterized by the presence 
of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), which can lead to liver failure. Genetic 
contributions, environmental factors including chemical and infectious xenobiotics, 
autoimmunity and loss of tolerance have been aggressively investigated in the pathogenesis 
of PBC, however, the actual impact of these factors is still controversial. Survival of PBC 
patients has been largely improved with the widespread use of ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA), however, one third of patients still do not respond to the treatment and proceed 
to liver cirrhosis, requiring liver transplantation as a last resort for cure. The outcome of 
liver transplantation is excellent with 5- and 10-year survival rates around 80% and 70%, 
respectively, while along with long survival, the recurrence of the disease has become an 
important outcome after liver transplantation. Prevalence rates of recurrent PBC rage 
widely between 1% and 35%, and seem to increase with longer follow-up. Center-specific 
issues, especially the use of protocol biopsy, affect the variety of incidence, yet, recurrence 
itself does not affect patient and graft survival at present, and retransplantation due to 
recurrent disease is extremely rare. With a longer follow-up, recurrent disease could have 
an impact on patient and graft survival.

recurrent disease after liver transplantation for PBC 
occurs in a considerable number of recipients and is 
currently a matter of concern (15-17).
 The aim of this review is to summarize recent 
studies of PBC with special reference to liver 
transplantation.
2. Natural history and characteristics of PBC
2.1. Epidemiology
In a systematic review of studies of PBC frequency, the 
incidence and prevalence of PBC was reported to range 
from 0.7 to 49 per million and 6.7 to 402 per million, 
respectively (18). The highest incidence and prevalence 
rates were reported from the UK (19,20), Scandinavia 
(21), Canada (22), and the US (23), all in the northern 
hemisphere, while the lowest were found in Australia 
(24). At the same time, the incidence was reported to be 
increasing with time (25).
 Most autoimmune diseases are predominant in 
female patients, and in PBC, this predominance is 
especially striking, the ratio of affected females to 
males is as high as 10:1 (26). The equivalent detection 
of AMAs between females and males in the general 
population might suggest either that the diagnosis of 
PBC might be suspected more frequently in women 
than in man or that progression from loss of tolerance to 
clinical liver disease might be more common in female 
patients (26).
2.2. Pathogenesis
Precise pathogenic mechanisms of developing PBC 
remain unknown. However, the development of PBC 
is believed to result from a combination of multiple 
genetic factors interacting with environmental triggers 
(27). Three important observations must be taken 
into account to understand the current pathogenic 
considerations of PBC. First, appearance of AMAs 
before developing liver disease suggests that loss of 
tolerance to the mitochondorial autoantigen is an initial 
event and could be independent of the development 
of liver disease. Second, although the autoantigen is 
present ubiquitously in all nucleated cells, the immune 
response is restricted to epithelial cells of intrahepatic 
bile ducts and less frequently to cells of salivary and 
lacrimal glands. Finally, recurrence of PBC after liver 
transplantation supports the idea that bile duct epithelial 
cells are a genetic target and are not unique to the naïve 
liver with PBC (4).
 Genetic contributions to PBC Genetic factors 
have an impact on PBC pathogenesis that is stronger 
than in nearly any other autoimmune disease (28,29). 
Observations that 1-6.4% of patients with PBC have 
at least one family member manifesting the disease 
(30-32), and that a concordance rate of 63% was seen in 
monozygotic twins (as opposed to null concordance in 
dizygotic twins) (33,34) shows the substantial genetic 
effect on disease susceptibility.
 Allelic variations in the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) genes, located in the highly polymorphic 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC), have been 
revealed to have an association with a large majority of 
autoimmune diseases (35). In PBC, the most commonly 
detected HLA association has been with the MHC class 
II DRB1*08 allele family (36), especially DRB1*0801 
in European and North American Caucasians (37-39) 
and DRB1*0803 in the Japanese (40,41). A protective 
association has been demonstrated with DRB1*11 
and DRB1*13, but once again, significant population 
differences were observed (36,38).
 Association has also been reported with 
polymorphisms of genes involved in innate or adaptive 
immunity. Allelic variations of tumor necrosis factor 
alfa (TNF alfa) (42,43), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 
4 (CTLA4) (42,44), and inteleukin 12 (IL12) (45) 
have so far been reported to be associated with PBC 
development in previous studies.
 Environmental factors Despite the above 
mentioned strong evidence for genetic contributions, 
epidemiological studies have since early times 
suggested a role of environmental factors in 
triggering or deteriorating PBC (46). A significant 
effect of environmental factors was supported by 
the identification of geographic disease "hot spots" 
(industrial, coal mining, and polluted areas) in previous 
studies (27,47-49). Additionally, hormone replace 
therapy (50), frequent use of nail polish (50), and 
smoking (50-52) have been associated with developing 
and accelerating PBC. These findings led many to 
hypothesize the possible association of exposure to 
chemical environmental compounds and xenobiotics 
(including drugs, pesticides, or other organic 
molecules) with PBC if those chemicals are excreted 
into bile and thereby concentrated in the biliary tree (53). 
Xenobiotics may affect the pathogenesis of PBC by 
triggering autoimmune reactions with a potential direct 
toxic effect on cell/protein or a potential modification 
of host proteins to form neoantigens (54,55). Infection 
is another important environmental factor (56). A 
significantly higher prevalence of recurrent urinary-tract 
infections than usual in patients with PBC has been 
reported (50,57). Additionally, a sequence similarity 
between the E2 enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase 
complex (PDC-E2), the main autoreactive antigen 
recognized by AMA identified in PBC, and bacterial 
proteins has been found in experimental studies (58). 
Among various pathogens investigated including 
Escherichia coli (59), Helicobacter spp (60), 
Mycoplasma (61), Chlamydia (62), and human beta 
retrovirus (63), Novosphingobium aromaticivorans
had the highest homology to PDC-E2 (64,65). Despite 
these intriguing associations, no compelling data have 
67

 Once tolerance to AMAs is lost, additional 
mechanisms entailed in the immune response to a 
ubiquitous autoantigen begin to be unraveled. These 
lead to specific injury of biliary epithelial cells and 
seem to be linked to unique processes of apoptosis 
(54,82). Unlike other cell types, PDC-E2 seems to 
remain intact in bile-duct cells after apoptosis, thus 
preserving its immunogenicity (83). It was found 
to exist within apoptotic blebs and to be accessible 
to AMAs and local antigen-presenting cells (84). 
Additionally, in-vitro experiments revealed an intense 
and specific immune response when macrophages 
of PBC patients were combined with apoptotic blebs 
on biliary epithelial cells and AMAs (85). However, 
recurrence of PBC after liver transplantation suggests 
that this scenario is not an intrinsic defect of bile-duct 
cells of affected individuals but is a feature of biliary 
epithelia in general, not seen in other epithelial cells.
2.3. Diagnosis
Increased awareness of the disease and the increasing 
availability of diagnostic tools, in particular serological 
testing, have led to a more frequent and earlier 
diagnosis of PBC (25). Most recently, more than half of 
the patients diagnosed with PBC are asymptomatic at 
first presentation (86,87). The diagnosis of PBC can be 
established in case two of the following three criteria 
are fulfilled: a concentration in serum of AMAs at titers 
of 1:40 or higher; an unexplained rise in the amount 
of alkaline phosphatase of at least 1.5 times the upper 
limit of normal for more than 24 weeks; and compatible 
liver histological findings, especially non-suppurative 
cholangitis and interlobular bile duct injury (88-90).
 Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma￾glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and cholesterol are 
commonly elevated in patients with PBC, however, 
the presence of AMA could be the first expression of 
PBC and could be found in an asymptomatic stage or 
in the absence of abnormal biochemical tests (89,90). 
To elucidate the frequency and antigen specificity of 
AMAs in the asymptomatic population and to identify 
patients with early PBC, Mattalia et al. (91) investigated 
the prevalence of AMA in a healthy population, and 
found that approximately 0.5% of the population was 
positive for AMA. Importantly, the pattern of reactivity 
to PDC-E2 in non-PBC individuals differed from that 
found in PBC patients in most of the AMA positive sera, 
demonstrating that AMA as a "natural" autoantibody 
is different from a "pathological" autoantibody in PBC 
patients. Mitchison et al. (92) evaluated and followed 
biochemical/histologic/clinical outcomes of AMA￾positive individuals with normal liver function, which 
revealed 24 out of 29 patients developed biochemical 
evidence of cholestasis and 22 became symptomatic, 
confirming a high predictive value of positive AMA 
testing for the development of PBC during a 10-year 
been provided to show that one individual infectious 
agent can reproducibly be detected in patients with 
PBC. Thus the model of infections as a cause of PBC is 
supported by little direct evidence (27).
 Autoimmunity and loss of self-tolerance The 
significant predominance of female patients, frequent 
co-existence of other autoimmune diseases both within 
individuals and among families, and most importantly, 
the presence of autoantibodies to self-mitochondrial 
proteins have led PBC to be referred to as a "model 
autoimmune disease" (27,66). The predominant 
autoreactive antibodies in PBC are AMAs, which, with 
a high sensitivity and specificity, are actually diagnostic 
for PBC when detected in serum (67). Follow-up data 
from AMA-positive individuals without signs of liver 
disease suggest that autoantibodies appear several years 
before onset of PBC and have a high predictive value 
for developing the disease (68).
 The identified targets of AMA are all members of 
the family of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes 
(2-OADC). This includes PDC-E2, the branched chain 
2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC-E2), 
the 2-oxo-glutaric acid dehydrogenase complex 
(OGDC-E2), and the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 
binding protein (E3BP), which all localize within 
the inner mitochondrial matrix, catalyzing oxidative 
decarboxylation of keto acid substrates (69,70). The 
targeted E2 subunits all have a common N-terminal 
domain containing single or multiple attachment 
sites for a lipoic acid cofactor to lysine. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that the dominant epitopes 
recognized by AMA are all localized within these 
lypoyl domains of the target antigens (71,72).
 In addition to AMAs, autoreactive CD8 and 
CD4 T cells to the same PDC-E2 domain have been 
identified both in peripheral blood and within the 
liver of PBC patients (73), and the same accounts for 
the dominant autoreactive B cells (74). CD8 T cells 
isolated from livers of PBC patients have been found to 
exert cytotoxicity against PDC-E2 pulsed autologous 
cells, supporting the hypothesis of a T cell response 
contributing to bile duct injury in PBC (75).
 It remains a mystery how PDC-E2 and other epitopes 
localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria become 
targets for autoimmune injury in PBC. Substantially 
lower rates of CD4 CD25 high regulatory T cells, 
acting to prevent autoreatctivity, could be an important 
factor in the breakdown of tolerance (76,77). Increased 
amounts of polyclonal IgM and hyper-responsiveness to 
the cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide motif (78), 
and enhanced natural killer cell (73,79) and monocyte 
responses (80), all which are found in PBC patients, also 
support the role of innate immunity in developing PBC. 
Another hypothesis is that modifications of 2-OADC 
by xenobiotics may alter these self-proteins to cause 
a breakdown of tolerance facilitating an autoimmune 
response (81).

follow-up (68). By contrast, individuals with AMA￾negative PBC diagnosed on the basis of elevated ALP 
and liver histologic findings comprise 5% of the PBC 
population and manifest a similar course compared to 
their seropositive counterparts (93).
 The need to undergo liver biopsy in PBC is 
controversial, although most clinicians agree that this 
procedure is valuable for disease staging, particularly 
in clinical trials. From a diagnostic point of view, liver 
biopsy specimens are not required when the other two 
criteria are fulfilled (89,90).
2.4. Clinical features and natural history of PBC
The clinical findings and natural history of PBC 
differ significantly among patients, ranging from 
asymptomatic with slow progression to symptomatic 
and rapidly evolving (94,95).
 Clinical findings Although non-specific, fatigue is 
the most common symptom of PBC, up to 80% of PBC 
patients complain about chronic fatigue and more than 
40% suffer moderate-to-severe symptoms (96,97). No 
correlation with the severity of liver disease has been 
demonstrated, however, fatigue can be associated with 
decreased overall survival (98,99). The mechanism 
of fatigue in PBC patients remains unknown, despite 
many proposals including autonomic dysfunction 
(100), muscle impairment (101), daytime somnolence 
(102), and altered central nervous system excitability 
(103,104).
 PBC is more frequently associated with pruritus 
than other chronic cholestatic liver diseases. During the 
course of the disease, 20% to 70% of patients complain 
of pruritus as the most distressing symptom. It develops 
independently of the degree of cholestasis and the stage 
of the disease (105).
 Bone density reduction is common in patients 
with PBC, with osteopenia (33%) and, less frequently, 
osteoporosis (11%) (106,107). Contrary to this, recent 
reports suggested that PBC might not represent an 
additional risk factor for bone demineralization in 
women with compensated disease when supplemented 
with calcium and vitamin D (108). Therefore, in clinical 
practice, such supplementation, along with monitoring 
of bone density and vitamin D, is highly recommended, 
even in patients at an early stage (89,90).
 Several autoimmune diseases could coexist with 
PBC in up to a third of patients, most frequently with 
Sjogren's syndrome and autoimmune thyroid disease. 
Coexistence of other autoimmune disease does not 
modify the course or clinical manifestation of PBC, 
with the exception of a reported slower progression of 
liver fibrosis in patients with scleroderma (109,110).
 Once PBC has progressed to cirrhosis, clinical 
features of liver dysfunction do not differ from those 
seen in patients with cirrhosis due to other causes, 
with the exception of esophageal varices, which can 
develop early in the disease course, sometimes before 
other signs of cirrhosis (111). The occurrence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma in PBC patients is similar to 
those with cirrhosis of other etiologies and warrants 
surveillance in patients at an advanced disease stage 
(112).
 Natural history The natural history and prognosis 
of PBC has become notably benign with significantly 
decreased mortality within the last two decades 
(1,8,113). Although these observations could be 
secondary to early diagnosis (1,8) and a consequent 
lead-time bias (4), falling rate of liver transplantation 
for PBC in western countries since widespread use of 
UDCA suggest an actual change in the natural history 
of PBC (13,14).
 Classically, PBC patients can progress from 
an asymptomatic stage to symptomatic stage with 
symptoms attributable to liver damage, such as 
itching, jaundice, esophageal varices, ascitis, and/or 
encephalopathy (1). The natural history of PBC has 
become more difficult to characterize given the rising 
number of asymptomatic cases which require long-term 
follow-up (113). Formerly, the presence of symptoms 
at diagnosis was an important determinant of disease 
progression and survival (114,115). The 10-year 
survival of asymptomatic patients ranged from 50 
to 70%, whereas the median duration of survival for 
symptomatic patients ranged 5 to 8 years from the onset 
of symptoms (87,114-116). Additionally, asymptomatic 
PBC patients were shown to have shortened survival 
compared to a healthy population (87,116). However, 
in a study from the UK of a large cohort of patients 
followed up for 24 years, although mortality due to 
liver disease was greatest in symptomatic patients, 
overall survival was similar in individuals with and 
without symptoms at the time of presentation (95). It 
seems difficult to conclude the impact of the presence 
of symptoms in PBC patients at present, however, 
considering the prognostic relevance of the presence 
of symptoms is well documented, and the higher 
proportions of asymptomatic patients enrolled in 
the more recent cohort studies explain, at least, the 
observed improvement in the natural history of PBC 
since the 1980s (117).
 Prediction of patients' survival with PBC has 
been attempted, and the Mayo model is the most well 
regarded, which includes five independent variables 
(age, total bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, and 
severity of ascitis), with amount of bilirubin in serum as 
the most heavily weighed (118).
2.5. Treatment of PBC
The only currently established treatment for PBC is 
UDCA 13-15 mg/kg a day (119). UDCA was shown to 
improve serum biochemical markers such as bilirubin, 
ALP, GGT, cholesterol, and IgM levels (120-125). 

www.irdrjournal.com
Intractable & Rare Diseases Research. 2012; 1(2):66-80.
UDCA may slow down histologic progression to liver 
cirrhosis (124,126), improve quality of life, survival 
free of transplant, and overall survival (9-12,127). 
However the mechanisms of UDCA in chronic 
cholestasis remain enigmatic (128), and about a third 
of patients are not sufficiently controlled with UDCA 
monotherapy, necessitating liver transplantation or an 
additional therapeutic approach (2).
 UDCA treatment for PBC-Natural history in the 
UDCA era UDCA is currently considered as the 
mainstay of treatment for PBC (89,90). Mechanisms 
of action of UDCA remain unclear, yet the hydrophilic 
nature of it could lead to a reduction in amounts of bile 
acids, and it might also regulate cellular signaling and 
protect against apoptosis (129,130).
 The rate of progression to cirrhosis was 13% 
in patients with UDCA and 49% in those without 
UDCA after a 6-year follow-up (131). Another study 
revealed that the rate of progression to cirrhosis was 
7% in patients with UDCA and 34% in those without 
UDCA after a 4-year follow-up, with 76% of UDCA￾treated patients remaining in an early disease stage, as 
compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients (126). 
A combined analysis of four clinical trials including 
367 patients also found significantly decreased disease 
progression in patients with UDCA (132). Another 
two also revealed improved survival without liver 
transplantation or reduction in the risk of death in 
patients with UDCA (127,133).
 The risk of developing varices was 16% for 
UDCA-treated patients which was significantly lower 
than that of 58% for those receiving the placebo in a 
4-year prospective observation (134). Additionally, 
many studies have demonstrated an improvement of 
biochemical and histological features with UDCA 
administration (120-125).
 Recently four long-term trials have found improved 
survival in UDCA-treated patients (9-12). Corpechot 
et al. (9) reported in 262 patients who had received 
13-15 mg/kg UDCA daily for a mean of 8 years that the 
overall survival rates were 84% and 66% at 10 and 20 
years, respectively. In early-stage patients, predictions 
to progress to liver transplantation or death were 6% 
and 22% at 10 and 20 years, respectively. The survival 
of early-stage patients was similar to that of the control 
population. In contrast, the probability of death or liver 
transplantation was significantly increased in patients 
treated in late-stages. Three other studies (10-12) also 
reported similar results. The survival rate of patients in 
early stages who biochemically responded to therapy 
was similar to that of the control populations in these 
studies. "Response" here is defined as a decrease in 
ALP to < 40% (10), or serum bilirubin < 1 mg/dl, ALP 
< 3x upper limit of normal, and AST < 2x upper limit 
of normal (11,12). 10-year transplant-free survival of 
90% in responders was reported, while it was 51% in 
non-responders (11).
 Despite these encouraging results, the beneficial 
effects of UDCA on survival have been questioned 
repeatedly. Actually, among a number of randomized 
placebo-controlled studies on UDCA (121-125,135,136), 
none of them could find a survival benefit with 
UDCA, and only two studies of an extension follow￾up found a positive effect on survival (137,138). 
Accordingly, several studies of meta-analysis based 
on these randomized studies concluded that UDCA 
has no benefit on the reduction of mortality and 
liver transplantation (139-141). The reported overall 
mortality and the rate of liver transplantation in PBC 
patients were both around 6% irrespective of the use 
of UDCA (140). However, when meta-analysis is 
performed with studies of a follow-up period over 2 
years and with those using an effective dose of UDCA 
of more than 10 mg/kg/day, UDCA significantly 
improves quality of life and transplant-free survival, 
and delays histologic progression in early-stage patients 
(142,143). Current guidelines therefore recommend to 
treat PBC with UDCA using doses of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day 
and to start treatment early (89,90).
 Considering the established autoimmunity of the 
disease, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive 
agents have been evaluated for therapeutic use in PBC. 
Prednisolone in combination with UDCA was proved 
to improve biochemical/histologic findings (144,145), 
however, not only the lack of survival benefit but 
also serious side-effects have precluded its use 
except for overlapping autoimmune hepatitis disease 
(146,147). Other immunosuppressive agents including 
budesonide (148), azathioprine (149), cyclosporine 
(150), mycophenolate mofetil (151), or methotrexate 
(152), and drugs with antifibrotic properties including 
penicillamine (153), colchicines (154), and silymarin 
(155) have been investigated, however, none of these 
drugs was shown to provide any additional benefit, in 
terms of clinically relevant events, when compared to 
UDCA monothreapy.
 Currently, about two thirds of patients treated with 
UDCA according to guidelines respond adequately 
and may have a normal life expectancy, while in the 
remaining one third of patients who fail to achieve a 
biochemical response or who are at an advanced stage 
at presentation, therapeutic options are extremely 
limited (156) and liver transplantation is necessitated as 
a last resort for cure (13).
3. Liver transplantation for PBC
PBC represents a major indication for liver transplantation 
in western countries, and to date over 6,000 liver 
transplants have been performed for PBC in the US and 
Europe (16,157). Over time, however, a notable decline 
in the number of liver transplantations and waiting list 
additions for PBC has been observed (13,14). Data 
from United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) 
70

www.irdrjournal.com
Intractable & Rare Diseases Research. 2012; 1(2):66-80.
show that the absolute number of liver transplantations 
increased by a mean 249 per year between 1995 and 
2006, while the absolute number of liver transplantation 
performed for PBC decreased steadily by a mean of 
5.4 cases per year in the same period (13). This is the 
case in Europe where a five-fold reduction of liver 
transplantation for PBC has occurred from 1988 to 2006 
(158). Despite the decrease in number of transplant 
cases among increasing numbers of PBC patients, liver 
transplantation still remains as a last curable option for 
end-stage PBC patients. 
3.1. Indication and timing of liver transplantation for 
PBC
Indications for liver transplantation in individuals with 
PBC do not differ from those in patients with other liver 
diseases, namely decompensated cirrhosis with intractable 
ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, recurrent 
variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or hepatocellular 
carcinoma (90). Christensen et al. (159) demonstrated 
that the optimal timing for liver transplantation in PBC 
(defined as the point when the probability of survival after 
transplantation is greater than the probability of survival 
without transplantation) is when the serum total bilirubin 
reaches around 10 mg/dl. It is recommended to refer to 
the liver transplant unit when the total bilirubin reaches 
6 mg/dl, the Mayo risk score is over 7.8, and the MELD 
score is over 12 (90).
 Treatment-resistant pruritus, severe recurrent 
encephalopathy, and recurrent variceal bleeding (despite 
preserved liver function) may also merit consideration 
for liver transplantation (160). In selected cases with 
severe pruritus that is refractory to medical treatment, 
liver transplantation remains the last resort (18). On 
the contrary, fatigue, one of the principle factors 
contributing to impairment of the quality of life, is 
not an indication for transplantation as available 
evidence does not support the efficacy of the 
procedure (161).
3.2. Survival after liver transplantation for PBC
Patients with PBC have more favorable outcomes after 
liver transplantation than those with viral hepatitis 
or alcoholic associated disease (162). An analysis of 
data from the ELTR in 2003 revealed a 1-, 5-, 10-year 
patient and graft survival of 83, 77 and 69%, and 79, 
71 and 64%, respectively, among 2,959 patients (163). 
Kashyap et al. (164) reported a retrospective analysis 
of the UNOS database of liver transplantation for PBC 
patients, in which a 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient survival 
among living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and 
deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) was 93, 90 
and 86 %, and 90, 87 and 85%, respectively, while a 1-, 
3-, and 5-year graft survival among LDLT and DDLT 
was 86, 81 and 77%, and 85, 83 and 81%, respectively. 
A Japanese study investigating LDLT for PBC revealed 
1- and 5-year survival of 80% and 75%, respectively 
(165). With excellent survival, recurrent disease has 
become a high-lightened problem in recipients who had 
received liver transplantation for PBC.
3.3. Recurrent PBC after liver transplantation
Recurrent PBC after liver transplantation was first 
reported in 1982 (166). Despite initial controversy, the 
recognition of recurrent PBC is now firmly established 
in the liver transplant community (16). Recent studies 
(14,167-181) of liver transplantation for PBC in 
individual programs (with over 40 PBC transplant 
cases) are summarized in Table 1. Although most 
studies at present have concluded that recurrent PBC 
has little impact on patient or graft survival following 
liver transplantation in the short- and medium-term, 
taking into account a considerable number of patients 
developing recurrent disease, continued longer follow￾up may identify impaired long-term patient/graft 
survival in patients with recurrent PBC. Ongoing 
debates for recurrent PBC focus on defining the 
factors associated with recurrent PBC so that strategies 
for prevention and treatment can be established. 
Additionally, investigation of recurrent PBC after liver 
transplantation may also provide helpful insights into 
the pathophysiology of PBC in the native liver.
3.4. Diagnosis of recurrent PBC
Unlike PBC in the native liver, clinical manifestations 
of recurrent PBC is not specific. Pruritis and jaundice, 
typical disease-related symptoms in PBC are rarely 
encountered in recurrent PBC. Fatigue, the most 
common complaint in PBC, and metabolic bone disease 
can be multifactorial and remain nonspecific in post￾transplant patients (16). Disease-related symptoms in 
recurrent PBC have been reported in about 10% patients 
in previous reports, with fatigue and pruritis being the 
most common complaints as in pre-transplant PBC 
(173,174). Yet, most studies do not address disease￾related symptoms, which might represent the rarity and 
difficult recognition of manifestations of recurrent PBC.
 Similary, most patients with recurrent PBC have 
normal or clinically insignificant elevation of serum 
liver biochemistry tests at the time of diagnosis 
(169,174,182,183), unlike at the diagnosis of PBC with 
native liver. Serum AMA, the most important criterion 
for the diagnosis of PBC, is not a marker for recurrence 
(182,184). The persistence of serum AMA has been 
demonstrated in previous studies, with immediate 
reduction after liver transplantation and subsequent 
identification in postoperative serial investigations 
(175,185-187). There seems to be no correlation 
between the presence or titer of serum AMA and the 
development of recurrent disease (182).

The gold standard for the diagnosis of recurrent 
PBC is histologic confirmation (188). The histologic 
hallmark of recurrent PBC is granulomatous 
cholangitis or the florid duct lesion (167,170-172,18
3,184,186,189), which are present in approximately 
60% of initial diagnostic liver biopsies (174). Less 
frequent inflammatory features, such as dense 
lymphoplasmacytic or plasma cell infiltrates within 
the portal tract, may correlate with subsequent disease 
recurrence (167,183,190). At the same time, it is 
important to differentiate between recurrent disease 
and other causes of bile duct damage in the graft, such 
as acute or chronic allograft rejection, ischemic injury, 
infection, or drug damage, though it may often be 
difficult or indeed impossible. The diagnostic criteria 
advocated by Neuberger et al. are presented in Table 2 
(188).
3.5. Epidemiology of recurrent PBC
The reported prevalence rates range from 1-35% in 
recent studies (Table 1). This wide variety may be 
due to different diagnostic criteria, the use of protocol 
biopsies by transplant units, and difficulty in histologic 
diagnosis. The most important factor relates to the 
use and timing of liver biopsies in follow-up (190), 
meaning performing biopsies for clinical indications 
alone will underestimate the prevalence rate (16).
 The time to recurrence also varies between 
studies, as shown in Table 1. The serial investigation 
at the same centers have reported increasing rates of 
recurrent disease over time indicating that more cases 
would be identified with a longer follow-up period 
(14,174,182,191). Among centers with over 100 cases 
of PBC transplants with long follow-up, the time to 
recurrence, and 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence 
rate were reported to range from 3.5-5.8 years, and 
21-37% and 43%, respectively (14,172,174,176,178,179).
3.6. Factors associated with recurrence
As described in the previous section, there is 
increasing evidence for a genetic predisposition for 
developing PBC in native liver. Accordingly genetic 
predominance, especially, the effect of HLA matching 
between donor and recipient, has been investigated 
in the disease recurrence of PBC patients after liver 
transplantation, however, it remains controversial so 
far. HLA allele frequency analysis by Sanchez et al. 
(169) demonstrated that patients with recurrence did 
have significant allele similarities; the donor alleles A1, 
B57, B58, DR44, DR57 and DR58 and the recipient 
allele B48 were found more often in recurrent PBC. 
Morioka et al. (175) suggested that a lower number of 
HLA mismatches between donor and recipient was an 
independent risk factor for disease recurrence following 
LDLT. Similarly, two large studies of DDLT reported

a relationship between HLA-mismatching, particularly 
DR-locus mismatch, and recurrent PBC (173,192). In 
contrast, Jacob et al. (178) found that no HLA-B match 
had significantly more disease recurrence. However, 
many other studies have failed to find any relevance 
between HLA-mismatch and recurrent disease both in 
DDLT and LDLT cohorts (169,171,174,180,193).
 Many reports have described that tacrolimus-based 
immunosuppression correlates with an increased risk 
of recurrent PBC and a reduced time to recurrence after 
liver transplantation when compared with cyclosporine 
(14,172,174,178,179,194-196). In contrast, recent 
meta-analysis by Gautam et al. (197), evaluating 16 
studies of 1,241 patients, could not find a significant 
difference between cyclosporine and tacrolimus in 
terms of recurrence, while there was a trend toward 
more recurrence in patients with tacrolimus. There is no 
clear explanation for these findings, but the beneficial 
effect of cyclosporine for native PBC or recent overall 
less-potent immunosuppression with tacrolimus may 
have some impact on recurrence of PBC (16).
 Other immunosuppressive agents, including steroids, 
azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil have also been 
investigated for association with recurrent disease. So 
far no study has found an association between steroid 
administration and recurrence (14,169,170,176). Given 
the recent trend of steroid tapering in conjunction 
with near-exclusive use of tacrolimus, discriminating 
for the effect of each agent on recurrent disease 
seems difficult in the absence of a controlled clinical 
trial. Recent studies, at least, validate that a tailored 
steroid regimen for recipients of PBC is unnecessary. 
Manousou et al. (180) recently reported that neither 
cyclosprorine nor tacrolimus alone had any impact on 
recurrent PBC, while cyclosproin in combination with 
azathioprine resulted in the lowest rates of recurrence. 
Sanchez et al. (169) found no difference in recurrence 
rate between patients with mycophenolate mofetil and 
those with azathioprine when used in conjunction with 
cyclosporine and steroids. Yet, no other study has found 
a correlation between recurrent PBC and azathioprine/
mycophenolate mofetil (170-172,198).
 Other donor and recipient factors have been 
scarcely investigated. Among those, an older age 
of both recipient and donor could be a debate in the 
future, considering the increasing number of PBC 
patients receiving liver transplants at older ages and the 
increasing use of older deceased donor livers, although 
the available studies at present are conflicting (14,174). 
Few studies investigated graft quality, suggesting that 
poor qualities of graft such as ischemic time (14,174) 
and graft histology (fibrosis and steatosis) (177) were 
risk factors for disease recurrence.
3.7. Disease progression and treatment
As shown in Table 1, graft or patient loss due to 
progression of recurrent disease is extremely rare, 
representing no effect on long-term outcomes in all 
studies. Two leading institutes of liver transplantation, 
the Mayo and Birmingham groups, have reported 3 out 
of 485 and 2 out of 154 cases required retransplantation, 
respectively (172,174). The Mayo group also reported 
the result of sequential protocol biopsies of definitely 
recurrent PBC, revealing that periportal fibrosis was 
present in 8 of 17 (47%) with a mean follow-up of 
5.9 years and that 2 of them further developed septal 
fibrosis during an additional 3 years of follow-up (182). 
The Birmingham group recently reported that the rate of 
graft loss due to recurrent disease was 5.4% among 541 
liver transplants for PBC with a median time from the 
diagnosis of recurrence to graft loss of 7.8 years, which 
was significantly lower than those of other etiologies 
(199). With a longer follow-up, recurrence of disease 
could have an impact on patient and graft survival.
 To date no standard guideline exists for 
treatment of recurrent PBC. The modification of 
immmunosuppression has not been formally reported 
as an interventional study. Based on the aforementioned 
possible beneficial effect of UDCA and its widespread 
use in PBC patients, and given nearly all recurrent 
PBC is diagnosed at an early stage, many authors have 
pointed out the potential role of UDCA for recurrent 
PBC after liver transplantation (14,169,171,174,178). 
However, in addition to the limitation of the small 
number of recurrent disease cases, normal or near 
normal serum liver biochemistries at initial diagnosis 
of most recurrent patients makes it challenging to 
assess the efficacy of UDCA. A recent report from the 
Mayo group found that 52% of patients with recurrent 
PBC treated with UDCA showed normalization of 
liver biochemistries, while the liver biochemistry 
normalization rate was 22% in untreated patients. 
However there was no significant difference in 
histologic progression between those with and without 
UDCA. Moreover, no long-term survival benefit was 
observed in patients treated with UDCA in the study 
(174). Whether UDCA treatment has an impact on the 
natural history of recurrent PBC needs to be further 
investigated in controlled trials with extended follow￾up.

4. Conclusion
The clinical course of PBC has become notably 
benign with the use of UDCA at an early stage and the 
establishment of liver transplantation for end-stage 
disease. In addition to investigations for pathogenesis 
of this entity and new treatment for those without 
response to UDCA therapy, the following issues need 
randomized controlled trials; the actual survival benefit 
of UDCA in the natural course of PBC, and the impact 
of cyclosporine and UDCA for those with recurrent 
disease after liver transplantation.
