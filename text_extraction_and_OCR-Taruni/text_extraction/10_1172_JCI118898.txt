Abstract
To determine whether indirect allorecognition is involved in
heart allograft rejection T cells obtained from peripheral
blood and graft biopsy tissues were expanded in the pres￾ence of IL-2 and tested in limiting dilution analysis (LDA)
for reactivity to synthetic peptides corresponding to the hy￾pervariable regions of the mismatched HLA-DR antigen(s)
of the donor. Serial studies of 32 patients showed that T cell
reactivity to donor allopeptides was strongly associated
with episodes of acute rejection. The frequency of allopep￾tide reactive T cells was 10–50-fold higher in the graft than
in the periphery indicating that T cells activated via the in￾direct allorecognition pathway participate actively in acute
allograft rejection. In recipients carrying a graft differing by
two HLA-DR alleles the response appeared to target only
one of the mismatched antigens of the donor. Indirect al￾lorecognition was restricted by a single HLA-DR antigen of
the host and directed against one immunodominant peptide
of donor HLA-DR protein. However, intermolecular spreading
was demonstrated in patients with multiple rejection epi￾sodes by showing that they develop allopeptide reactivity
against the second HLA-DR antigen. These data imply that
early treatment to suppress T cell responses through the in￾direct pathway of allorecognition, such as tolerance induc￾tion to the dominant donor determinant, may be required to
prevent amplification and perpetuation of the rejection pro￾cess. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1150–1157.) Key words: al￾lopeptide • alloreactivity • acute rejection • T cell determi￾nants • MHC-restriction
Introduction
The long-term function of organ allografts is often compro￾mised by rejection, a complex phenomenon which involves
both the cellular and the humoral arms of the immune re￾sponse. The mechanism of allograft rejection is not completely
understood, although it has become increasingly clear that re￾cipient T helper (Th)1
 cells become activated upon direct rec￾ognition of MHC/peptide complexes present on the mem￾brane of passenger dendritic cells of donor origins (1–4). This
vigorous response, which appears to violate the rule of self
MHC restriction, is driven primarily by antigenic mimicry (5,
6). In nonsensitized transplant recipients, T cells activated via
the direct allorecognition pathway are thought to be important
for initiation of early acute rejection. However, these directly
activated T cells seem to be less critical at later times, follow￾ing departure of donor dendritic cells from the graft, because
upon recognition of donor MHC molecules on “nonprofes￾sional” antigen presenting cells (APCs) that lack co-stimula￾tory elements, they may become anergized (7–10).
 More recently, several lines of evidence have indicated
that the indirect recognition pathway, which describes the
stimulation of recipient T cells by allopeptides processed and
presented on self-MHC expressed by recipient APCs, is a ma￾jor contributor to rejection. Thus, during rejection of skin, kid￾ney or heart allografts, T cells recognizing processed forms of
donor MHC antigens associated with host restriction elements
were detected in the primary lymphoid organs of mice and rat
recipients (11–13). Animals immunized with soluble class I or
class II allogeneic MHC molecules or with synthetic MHC al￾lopeptides were capable of accelerated rejection of skin al￾lografts (14–16). Studies using MHC class II deficient mice as
donors showed that in the absence of direct recognition T cells
activated via the indirect pathway initiate rapid skin allograft
rejection (17, 18). Alloreactive, self MHC restricted T cells
were shown to provide the lymphokines required for the gen￾eration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), alloantibodies and
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses (9, 15, 17–19).
 In the human model it has been demonstrated that two dis￾tinct populations of T cells, one involved in the direct and the
other in the indirect recognition pathway, are activated after
mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) stimulation (20). Further￾more, T cells immunized in vitro with synthetic allopeptides
respond specifically to the native alloantigen in the presence of
self-APCs (21–24).
 Both in mice and in humans, T cell proliferation to an allo￾geneic MHC protein was limited to a single dominant determi￾nant and restricted by a self-HLA-DR molecule (10, 21, 24,
25). T cell receptor (TCR)-Vb gene usage by T cells respond￾ing to the dominant allopeptide was also shown to be limited
(21, 26). This suggests that indirect recognition is amenable to
specific immunointervention (9, 10, 13, 24).

Allopeptide Reactivity in Rejection 1151
 A detailed understanding of when and how the indirect
pathway becomes activated in immunosuppressed organ al￾lograft recipients should provide valuable insight into the de￾velopment of strategies to block T cell alloreactivity through
the indirect pathway.
 Because allopeptide-specific T cells require that donor al￾loantigens be shed from the graft, proteolyzed and the result￾ing fragments bound to an MHC class II molecule of the host,
it is important to establish whether their activation is the cause
or consequence of early acute rejection and whether they rec￾ognize single or multiple determinants of donor HLA-DR an￾tigens. To address these questions, we have evaluated the fre￾quency of activated T cells recognizing donor allopeptides, in
peripheral blood and biopsy tissue of heart allograft recipients
during the early posttransplantation period. In vivo activated
T cells were expanded in IL-2 and tested in LDA for reactivity
to synthetic peptides corresponding to each of the mismatched
HLA-DR antigens of the donor. The results provide evidence
to support the role of the indirect recognition pathway in rejec￾tion. The data also suggest that one of the mismatched HLA￾DR antigens is preferentially targeted by alloreactive T cells.
Selective immunosuppression may be required for ablation of
the immune response to this specific determinant.
Methods
Patient specimens. 32 heart recipients (28 male and 4 females) were
recruited for these studies during the first 10 wk after transplantation.
All gave informed consent under the auspices of the appropriate In￾stitution Review Board. Patients were treated with cyclosporin A,
prednisone and azathioprine. Endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) were
performed routinely for monitoring rejection according to a standard
time schedule (27). Four biopsy fragments were processed for histo￾logic analysis and one was made available for immunologic studies
(27). Blood specimens were obtained from the patients at the time of
EMB. LDA studies were initiated between the 1st and 2nd week on
12 patients, between the 3rd and 4th week on 11 patients, and be￾tween week 5 and 10 on 9 patients. Acute rejection, diagnosed on bi￾opsies as histologic grade 1B, 2 or 3A according to Billingham’s crite￾ria (28), was treated with increased doses of immunosuppression. 
HLA typing. All recipients and donors were typed for HLA-DR
antigens by conventional serology and by molecular methodology us￾ing PCR-SSOP (sequence specific-oligonucleotide probe).
Peptide synthesis. Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues
1-19, 21-39, 62-80 of DRb1 chain from 32 HLA-DR alleles
(DRb1*0101, DRb1*0102, DRb1*0301, DRb1*0302, DRb1*0401,

DRb1*1601, and DRb1*1602) (29) were obtained from Chiron Mim￾otopes (San Diego, CA) and Peptide Innovation (Raleigh, NC). The
purity of peptides was higher than 90%, as indicated by HPLC and
mass spectrometry. Synthetic peptides were dissolved in RPMI 1640
medium at a concentration of 2mg/ml. Before use in this study all
peptides were tested in LDA for their ability to stimulate alloreactiv￾ity of PBMC from healthy members of our HLA-DR reference panel.
Limiting dilution analysis of allopeptide reactive T cells. The fre￾quency of allopeptide reactive T cells in the peripheral blood and bi￾opsy was measured in LDA. The methods used for LDA were essen￾tially identical except for the fact that to obtain a sufficient number of
cells, T cells from biopsy tissue had to be expanded for one week in
medium with IL-2 before testing in LDA. Also, while cells from the
peripheral blood were tested in LDA at concentrations ranging from
1 to 4 3 104
 cells/well, cells from biopsy tissue were tested at concen￾trations ranging from 2 to 8 3 102
 cells/well given their limited num￾ber (z 100,000 T cells per 1 mm3
 biopsy).
Briefly, PBMCs were grown for 7 d in round bottom 96-well trays
at concentrations of 4 3 104
, 2 3 104
, 1 3 104
 per well (24 wells for
each concentration) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
human serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 50 units re￾combinant (r)IL-2/ml (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN.), as
described by Zhang et al. (30). On day 7, plates were washed three
times and each culture was split into four aliquots. Two plates were
used for testing T cell reactivity to a cocktail of peptides (1 mM of
each peptide) corresponding to each of the mismatched HLA-DR an￾tigens of the donor in the presence of irradiated autologous PBMCs
(5 3 104
/well). The third plate, to which only self PBMCs (without
peptides) were added, served as a negative control. After 48 h of in￾cubation, the cultures were labeled with [3H]TdR and harvested 18 h
later. Wells were scored positive if cpm in cultures with allopeptides
exceeded 2000 and were at least three times higher than cpm in repli￾cate control cultures without the peptides. The fourth plate was left
unlabeled and kept for T cell expansion and HLA-DR restriction
studies. Th frequency was calculated as previously described (23, 30).
Graft tissue (1 mm3
 piece) was placed in 24-well plates containing
1 3 106
 autologous APCs (irradiated with 3000rad) in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with low concentrations of rIL-2 (5 U/ml) and
10% human serum. After 7 d of expansion, T cells were collected,
washed and plated at concentrations of 800, 400, and 200 cells/well in
round bottom 96-well tray (24 replicate cultures for each concentra￾tion). Irradiated autologous APCs (5 3 104
/well) in RPMI 1640 me￾dium supplemented with 50 units (r)IL-2/ml were added to each well.
On day 7 the wells were split as above and T cell reactivity to allopep￾tides was tested in a 3-d blastogenesis assay.
Analysis of dominant allopeptide determinants and of restriction
elements. To identify the dominant peptide(s) recognized by T cells
in LDA T cell lines were generated and tested for reactivity to each
individual peptide comprised in the stimulating mixture of donor-spe￾cific allopeptides. The culture conditions required for generation and
propagation of allopeptide-specific human T cell lines have been pre￾viously described (21). Briefly, cells from cultures corresponding to
wells in which T cell reactivity to donor allopeptides was detected
were expanded in 24-well plates in the presence of autologous APCs
(1 3 106
/well), stimulating peptide mixture (1 mM of each peptide)
and rIL-2 (20 U/ml). Cultures were restimulated every 14 d by addi￾tion of irradiated APCs, peptide mixture and IL-2. After three or
four stimulations the resulting T cell lines (2 3 104
 T cells/well) were
tested for reactivity to the individual peptides comprised in the mix￾ture (1 mM), in the presence of APCs (5 3 104
/well) from the recipi￾ent and from hemi-allogeneic donors sharing one HLA-DR antigen
with the recipient. Allopeptide-reactivity was measured in 3 d blasto￾genesis assays as previously described (21).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using BMDP statis￾tical software (BMDP Statistical Software, Inc., Los Angeles, CA).
The incidence of rejection one month following LDA was calculated
by the product-limit method. Differences between groups were com￾pared using Breslow statistics. A test of linear trend was used to ana￾lyze the relationship between allopeptide reactivity and progression
of acute rejection (31). 
Results 
Activation of the indirect recognition pathway during allograft
rejection. To determine whether indirect allorecognition con￾tributes to allograft rejection, T cells obtained from the periph￾eral blood of 32 heart transplant recipients were expanded in
medium supplemented with rIL-2 and then tested for reactiv￾ity to synthetic allopeptides corresponding to the hypervari￾able regions of the mismatched HLA-DR antigens of the do￾nor. A minimum of two serial PBMC specimens (mean 3.5)

1152 Liu et al.
were obtained from each patient with elapsed intervals of 1 to
12 wk (mean 4.1 wk) between collections. After 7 d of expan￾sion in medium containing rIL-2, T cells were tested in LDA
for reactivity against synthetic peptides corresponding to each
HLA-DR antigen of the donor. T cell proliferation in response
to one or both sets of donor DR peptides was considered in￾dicative of in vivo activation of the indirect recognition path￾way. 49 out of the 120 samples of PBMCs studied in LDA con￾tained allopeptide reactive T cells. The frequency of acute
rejection episodes, occurring one month following the LDA
test, was significantly higher when allopeptide reactive T cells
were present in the circulation, than when they were absent
(P , 0.001) (Fig. 1). IL-2 expanded T cells from 20 healthy
controls showed no proliferation to mixtures of synthetic al￾lopeptides (data not shown). 
14 recipients had concomitant PBMC and biopsy speci￾mens. Tests of linear trend revealed a significant correlation
between allopeptide reactivity in the periphery (P , 0.001)

were detected. Rejection was monitored by EMB and considered to

method.

and graft (P , 0.002), and progression of the rejection process
(Table I). The presence of allopeptide reactive T cells in the
circulation was predictive of rejection in 18 of 28 cases (64%).
Although at the time of LDA testing, these patients showed no
histopathologic evidence of rejection, the subsequent biopsy
(performed within 1-4 weeks) showed rejection grade 1B, 2 or
3. The early appearance of allopeptide-reactive Th cells in the
circulation suggests that these cells play a role in initiating re￾jection by producing the lymphokines required for the genera￾tion of CTL, DTH and inflammatory responses. LDAs per￾formed at the time of rejection revealed the presence of T cells
activated by the indirect pathway in most PBMC (88%) speci￾mens tested. During resolving rejection, which is characterized
histologically by a lesser degree of graft damage than seen be￾fore rejection treatment (28), only 35% of PBMC samples
studied showed allopeptide reactive T cells. Ninety-four per￾cent of LDAs were negative in patients with no histologic evi￾dence of rejection for a period of one month, indicating that
quiescence was related to the absence of allopeptide reactive T
cells (Table I). The decreased incidence of positive LDA after
treatment of acute rejection suggests that the indirect recogni￾tion pathway is susceptible, at least in part, to inhibition by con￾ventional immunosuppressive drugs (methylprednisolone and
cyclosporine), consistent with other studies (32, 33).
Frequency and HLA-DR specificity of allopeptide reactive
T cells. The frequency of allopeptide-reactive T cells was 10–
50-fold higher within the population of T cells infiltrating the
graft than within the subset of peripheral blood T cells selec￾tively expanded in medium with rIL-2 (Table II). This suggests
that T cells activated via the indirect allorecognition pathway
participate actively in acute allograft rejection.
Of particular interest was the finding that although 19 of
the heart recipients included in these studies were mismatched
from the donor for two HLA-DR antigens, self-MHC re￾stricted Th reactivity was directed against only one of the do￾nor’s HLA-DR antigens in 15 of these patients.
 LDA studies of allopeptide reactivity showed that this biased
T cell recognition of a single donor DR antigen occurred both in
the periphery and in the graft (Table II). Because the frequency
of allopeptide reactive Th cells infiltrating the graft during rejec￾tion was 10–50-fold higher, compared with the periphery, it is un￾likely that the failure of recipient T cells to recognize the second

1154 Liu et al.
mismatched HLA-DR antigen was due to the low frequency of
the corresponding TCRs and/or to the insensitivity of the assay
system. It is more plausible that there was differential processing
and competition between allopeptides for occupancy of MHC￾class II antigens on host APCs and that a single dominant al￾lopeptide reached the stimulatory threshold (10, 34–36).
 However, the T cell response to donor antigens during al￾lograft rejection appears to be a dynamic process. Thus, in four
patients who displayed multiple rejection episodes, indirect al￾lorecognition of both donor DR antigens occurred at various
times following transplantation (Fig. 2). In only one of these
patients (Fig. 2 A), who was mismatched from the donor by
HLA-DRb1*1501 and 0301, LDA study of the peripheral
blood showed Th reactivity against both DR15 and DR3 pep￾tides throughout the first rejection episode. A second episode,
occurring 11 weeks following transplantation was accompa￾nied by reactivity against DR3 but not against DR15 peptides.
In the remaining three patients alloreactivity was directed
against a single donor DR antigen during the first episode, yet
the response spread to include the other DR antigen during
subsequent episodes of acute rejection (Fig. 2, B–D). 
To identify the determinant(s) which T cells recognize dur￾ing rejection, allopeptide-reactive T cells from LDA studies
were expanded in medium containing rIL-2, autologous APCs
and the mixture of stimulatory peptides corresponding to the
sensitizing HLA-DR antigen. The resulting T cell lines were
tested for reactivity to each component of the mixture in the
presence of hemi-allogeneic APCs sharing with the recipient
one HLA-DR antigen. These experiments showed that al￾though six of the eight T cell lines studied were obtained from
HLA-DR heterozygous recipients, allopeptide reactivity was
restricted by a single HLA-DR element of the host (Table III).
As indicated above, the response was directed against the dom￾inant determinant of a single HLA-DR antigen, even when the
donor was mismatched from the recipient by two HLA-DR al￾leles (Table III, patients B.C., I.P., B.R., X.J., F.J., H.M.). 
Mapping of the dominant determinant of the DRb1*0101
molecule recognized in vivo by DRb1*1101 recipients con￾firmed previous in vitro studies, identifying peptide 21-39 as
the dominant peptide. Seven additional dominant determi￾nants were identified (Table III). Peptide 21-39 of DRb1*0101
molecule is also the dominant T cell epitope recognized
by DRb1*1104 responders. The dominant epitope of the
DRb1*0301 protein presented by DRb1*0101 molecule is
peptide 1-19. Peptide 62-80 of the DRb1*0401 molecule is the
dominant determinant presented in the context of DRb1*0701.
Peptide 1-19 of the DRb1*1301 protein is the dominant deter￾minant recognized by T cells in the context of DRb1*0701.
Peptide 1-19 of the DRb1*1501 molecule is the dominant deter￾minant which T cells recognize in the context of DRb1*0401
and DRb1*1104. Finally, peptide 21-39 of DRb1*1503 is the
dominant determinant recognized by DRb1*1501 responders.
 Based on previous studies showing that when dominant al￾lopeptides are used at high concentration they inhibit specifi￾cally the indirect recognition response, it is expected that these
newly mapped determinants may also induce high zone toler￾ance to the corresponding MHC molecule (22, 23).
Discussion
It is currently accepted that both the direct and indirect path￾way of allorecognition are involved in allograft rejection. The
frequency of T cells which directly recognize intact allo-MHC
molecules on the surface of target cells is at least 100-fold
higher than that of T cells recognizing allopeptides processed
and presented by self MHC (20). This finding suggests that the
direct pathway of allorecognition dominates the rejection re￾sponse during the early posttransplantation period when
MHC-class II antigens expressed on donor dendritic cells vig￾orously stimulate the T helper cell response of the host. 
 However, the role of direct allorecognition seems to di￾minish after passenger leukocytes of donor origin have left the

dendritic cells but has no effect on grafts depleted of passenger
leukocytes (37).

cells, notably interferon g, induce MHC class II expression on
endothelial and epithelial cells of the graft, such defective non￾professional APCs may anergize rather than stimulate allore￾active T cells (10, 38). In contrast to the direct recognition
pathway which depends on the presence in the graft of profes￾sional APCs of donor origin, the indirect pathway is stimulated
by allopeptides presented by professional APCs (dendritic
cells, macrophages) of host origin. Because of the continuous
supply of host APCs which have processed donor allopeptides,
self-MHC restricted Th cells may perpetuate rejection, gener￾ating help for activation of CTL and alloantibody production.
This may eventually result in chronic rejection, a phenomenon
which claims the function of almost 50% of all organ allografts
within 5 years after transplantation. The prevention of this ir￾reversible process may require the development of novel strat￾egies for suppression of the indirect allorecognition pathway.
The exquisite specificity of self-MHC restricted T cells for the
dominant determinant of allogeneic MHC molecules raises the
possibility of using high doses of dominant peptide antigens for
tolerance induction or of designing non-immunogenic analogs
of the wild-type peptide which act as MHC blockers or TCR
antagonists. However, the design of therapeutic protocols
based on the use of peptides awaits a detailed understanding
of the relationship between self-MHC restricted T cell allore￾activity and rejection.
 To our knowledge the present study describes for the first
time the kinetics of indirect allorecognition in patients with or￾gan allografts. These investigations demonstrate that in heart
transplantation the development and progression of acute re￾jection is strongly associated with the appearance both in the
graft and in the recipient’s circulation of T cells which react to
donor HLA-DR peptides. Because the presence of allopeptide
reactive T cells in the circulation was predictive of rejection,
indirect alloreactivity seems to be the cause rather than the
consequence of acute rejection. It is likely that following al￾loantigen recognition allopeptide primed T cells infiltrate the
graft and secrete lymphokines which promote the generation
of CTL, DTH and inflammatory responses characteristic of
acute rejection. During resolving rejection and quiescence self￾MHC restricted alloreactive T cells disappeared from the cir￾culation and graft tissue, in a pattern consistent with the con￾cept that they play an active role in the acute rejection process.
Although the frequency of allopeptide reactive T cells was 10–
50-fold lower in the periphery than in the graft, the finding that
they were detectable in the circulation before rejection could
be recognized histologically on graft biopsies opens the way to
the development of non-invasive procedures for early predic￾tion of rejection.
The strategy used for determining the frequency of al￾lopeptide reactive T cells was similar to that described by Zhang
et al. (30) for the detection of T cells reactive to myelin basic
protein in patients with multiple sclerosis. Because T cells
were cultured with IL-2 before stimulation with donor al￾lopeptides, it may be argued that reactivity reflected the in
vitro resuscitation of anergic cells. Such a mechanism implies
that allopeptide reactive T cell clones were anergized in vivo
by exposure to breakdown products of allogeneic MHC mole￾cules (possibly presented by other T cells) (30, 39) and that
their presence in the graft and periphery has no pathologic
consequences.
 Although this hypothetical situation cannot be ruled out it
is unlikely to have occurred because the presence of allopep￾tide reactive T cells in the periphery and in the graft correlated
with each other and with rejection. Anergic T cells should have
remained detectable during quiescence particularly in those
patients who showed allopeptide reactive T cells during a pre￾vious rejection episode. Our failure to detect allopeptide reac￾tive T cells during quiescence may reflect their low frequency
and /or lack of high affinity IL-2 receptors.
 However, it is conceivable that anergy may play an impor￾tant role in the maintenance of allogeneic tolerance, and that
high extracellular concentrations of soluble MHC alloantigens
may be required for inducing it. This possibility is consistent
with the finding that T cells reacting to self antigens, including
MHC, are present in the peripheral circulation of healthy indi￾viduals with no autoimmune conditions, and are probably
maintained in a state of anergy (40, 41).
 Of particular interest was the finding that in recipients
transplanted with heart allografts mismatched for two HLA￾DR antigens primary episodes of acute rejection appeared to
be triggered by only one of the donor’s HLA-DR antigens.
Study of Th reactivity in the circulation and in the graft
showed that the response was specific for a dominant peptide
derived from the polymorphic region of one of the donor’s
HLA-DR antigen. Although most patients were HLA-DR
heterozygous Th reactivity to donor allopeptide was restricted
in all cases by a single HLA-DR element of the host. 
 This biased recognition of a sole allodeterminant in HLA￾DR heterozygous donor-recipient combinations may reflect
differential antigen processing and selection of specific pep￾tides, a phenomenon presumed to be controlled by an allelic
polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with some MHC-class
II genes (10, 34–36). Thus, analyses of T cell responses to self￾peptides in several H-2 recombinant mice demonstrated that
the peptide-selection for presentation to autoreactive T cells is
controlled by genes that mapped to a 170-kb portion of class II
region of the MHC locus (42). Similarly, studies of human B
cell lines with mutations in the HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB
region showed that such cells manifest defective formation of
class II peptide complexes. Expression of normal HLA-DMB
or HLA-DMA cDNA in these mutants restored their APC
function, indicating that antigen presentation is regulated by
HLA-linked genes different from conventional HLA-class II
(35, 36). It is, therefore, possible that by contributing to the se￾lection of MHC peptides available for presentation on MHC￾class II molecules, this allelic polymorphism may play an es￾sential role in T cell alloreactivity.
 However, the specificity of T cell responses to donor anti￾gens may change during progression of rejection since in a few
patients with multiple acute rejection episodes alloreactivity
spread from one donor HLA-DR to the second DR antigen.
This finding has important implication for the design of anti￾gen-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of acute and
chronic rejection.
 It is possible that inflammation within the graft, interferon
g production, tissue damage and upregulation of MHC expres￾sion may contribute to intermolecular antigen spreading fol￾lowing a rejection episode. The observation that T cell speci-

1156 Liu et al.
ficities appear to change during the relapsing-remitting course
of the alloimmune response is consistent with studies on au￾toimmune diseases (10, 43) as well as with the finding that the
antibody response of transplant patients spreads from one al￾loantigen to another during rejection (44).
 Mapping of dominant T cell allodeterminants is essential
for the design of inhibitory peptides. Further immunogenetics
analysis will be required to determine whether peptides which
are dominant in the context of one HLA-DR restrictive ele￾ment are cryptic when presented by the other haplotype. Al￾though during the course of these follow-up studies no in￾tramolecular spreading of epitopes was observed, it remains
possible that determinants which are cryptic when presented
by one type of APC (dendritic cells for example) become dom￾inant when presented by other APCs (such as B cells) (10, 44).
Furthermore, because the peptides selected in this study cover
the hypervariable but not the less polymorphic region of the
first domain of the DRb1* chain, it is possible that determi￾nant spreading to cryptic epitopes from these less variable
regions has remained undetected. It will be important to de￾termine whether alloreactive B cells, which participate in anti￾body-mediated chronic rejection, activate T cell reactivity to
such cryptic allopeptides.
 Taken together, the data indicate that following transplan￾tation T cells recognize processed forms of donor HLA pro￾teins associated with a host HLA-DR restriction element. The
response of in vivo activated T cells is limited to a single domi￾nant determinant of an allogeneic MHC molecule consistent
with previous studies on human T cells allo-activated in vitro
with soluble HLA-DR proteins (22), and on T cells from mice
undergoing skin allograft rejection (10). 
 Because T cell receptor Vb gene usage in response to the
dominant allopeptide is also limited (21, 26), selective immune
intervention such as treatment with anti-TCR antibodies or in￾duction of tolerance to the dominant determinant may repre￾sent viable options for specific suppression of indirect recogni￾tion. Treatment to block the indirect recognition pathway may
prevent the initiation and amplification of transplant rejection,
particularly after professional APCs of donor origin have left
the graft, rendering it less vulnerable to direct allorecognition.
