Abstract
Alveolar macrophages, resident phagocytic cells in the lung
that derive from peripheral blood monocytes, are paradoxi￾cally ineffective in presenting antigen to T cells. We found
that antigen presentation by alveolar macrophages could be
restored by the addition of anti-CD28 mAb to cultures of
T cells and macrophages, indicating that costimulation by
alveolar macrophages via the CD28 pathway was defective.
In addition, we found that alveolar macrophages activated
with IFN-y failed to express B7-1 or B7-2 antigens, which
normally ligate CD28 on T cells and provide a costimulatory
signal required for the activation of T cells. These observa￾tions are the first to demonstrate the inability of a "profes￾sional" antigen-presenting cell type to effectively express
the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2. Inasmuch as
immune reactions within the lung are inevitably associated
with inflammatory injury to pulmonary tissue, these obser￾vations suggest that reduced expression of B7-1 and B7-2
by alveolar macrophages may be advantageous, as a critical
mechanism involved in the induction of peripheral tolerance
to the abundance of antigens to which mucosal tissues are
continuously exposed. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:1415-1421.)

Introduction
Alveolar macrophages, resident phagocytic cells in the lung that
derive from peripheral blood monocytes (1), are paradoxically
ineffective in presenting antigen to T cells. Because the lung
is a gas exchange organ, it is exposed to large quantities of
contaminants and antigens suspended in the air, yet, despite
expressing normal levels of class II MHC antigens (2, 3) and
having normal bactericidal activity, alveolar macrophages have

been shown to be defective in activating resting T lymphocytes
and initiating inflammatory responses (3-6).
The purpose of these studies was to determine the reason
for the failure of alveolar macrophages to effectively activate
CD4 + T cells. Activation of CD4 + T cells requires at least two
signaling events: one triggered by the ligation of the T cell
receptor complex by antigen peptide/class II MHC on the anti￾gen-presenting cells (APC);' the other signaling event gener￾ated by the ligation of costimulatory molecules on T cells (e.g.,
CD28) by counterreceptors (e.g., B7-2) on APC such as macro￾phages, B cells, and dendritic cells (7-11). We found that
human alveolar macrophages were deficient at presenting the
antigen tetanus toxoid (TT) to autologous CD4+ T cells and
were deficient at activating CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 mAb.
Antigen presentation by alveolar macrophages in both cases
(with TT and anti-CD3 mAb) was restored by the addition
of anti-CD28 mAb, indicating that costimulation by alveolar
macrophages via the CD28 pathway was defective. Moreover,
we found that alveolar macrophages activated with IFN-y failed
to express B7-1 or B7-2 antigens, which normally ligate CD28
on T cells and provide a costimulatory signal required for the
activation of T cells (9, 12, 13). These results indicated that
the inability of alveolar macrophages to present antigen effec￾tively to T cells was due to the failure of alveolar macrophages
to express sufficient quantities of the B7-1 and B7-2 antigens
which resulted in a failure to provide effective costimulatory
signaling to T cells.
These observations were the first to demonstrate the failure
of a "professional" APC type to effectively express the costim￾ulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 and were thus unexpected.
However, inasmuch as immune reactions within the lung are
inevitably associated with inflammatory injury to pulmonary
tissue, our observations indicate that reduced expression of B7-
1 and B7-2 by APC in the lung may be advantageous, as a
critical mechanism that limits immune responses in the lung and
in mucosal tissues which are continuously exposed to abundant
quantities of antigen.

Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research, and all
subjects gave written informed consent.
Antigens, mAbs. TT was obtained from Connaught Laboratories
(Swiftwater, PA) and was used in culture at 10 jig/ml. The anti-CD3
hybridoma OKT3 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD), and mAb purified from culture supernatants was used
in culture at 50 ng/ml. Anti-CD28 ascites fluid (obtained from Dr. Jeff
Ledbetter, Bristol Myers/Squibb, Seattle, WA) was used in culture at
- 1 pg/ml. Ascites fluid of the anti-IL-10 hybridoma, JES3.19F, ob￾tained from ATCC with permission from Dr. John Abrams (DNAX
Institute, Palo Alto, CA), was used in culture at 5 pg/ml. Control rat
IgGI (Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom) was used at 5 ,g/
ml. FACSO analysis was performed using the 133 mAb (an IgM anti￾B7-4 mAb) (7) as ascites fluid at a 1:500 dilution. FACSO staining
with anti-B7-2 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), L243 (anti-class II
MHC), control IgM mAb (HB 130, anti-murine CD8), and control IgG
mAb (HB129, anti-murine CD8) was performed at 10 jig/ml, using a
fluorescinated anti-mouse Ig second antibody (Jackson ImmunoRe￾search Labs, Inc., West Grove, PA).
Cytokines. GM-CSF (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) was used
in culture at 20 ng/ml. IFN-y (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco,
CA) was used at 500-1,000 U/ml. IL-12 was generously provided by
Stanley Wolf (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) and used at 50 U/ml.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Subjects were admitted to the Gen￾eral Clinical Research Center at Stanford University Hospital and under￾went flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL under controlled condi￾tions based on the recommendation of the NHLBI Workshop on the
Investigative Use of Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy and Bronchoalveolar La￾vage in Asthmatics (14). A flexible bronchoscope was passed into the
bronchus of a segment of the right middle lobe, and 250 ml of warmed
saline was instilled in aliquots into the lung and recovered by gentle
aspiration through the bronchoscope. The BAL fluid was chilled on ice
until processing, at which time the BAL fluid was pooled and centrifuged
at 200 g ( 1,000 rpm) for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed once with
PBS and resuspended in complete medium. The cells were then layered
over Percoll (45%) (Pharmacia, Alameda, CA) to remove contaminat￾ing lymphocytes and red cells, and centrifuged for 45 min at 800 g at
4°C. The cells at the interface were collected, washed twice in PBS,
and resuspended to a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml in complete
media. This method resulted in a recovery of 80-85% of cells in the
BAL fluid, and the resulting cells were > 95% large granular macro￾phages.
Mononuclear cell isolation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood by flotation over Ficoll￾Hypaque (Sigma Immunochemicals, St. Louis, MO). Cells were washed
three times in PBS and then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT), supplemented with 2 mM L￾glutamine, essential and nonessential amino acids, essential vitamins, 1
mM sodium pyruvate, gentamycin (5 jig/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml),
streptomycin ( 100 jIg/ml), and 10% AB + human serum (Sigma Immu￾nochemicals).
Preparation of monocyte containing population. APCs were pre￾pared from peripheral blood by incubating fresh PBMC (5-10 x 106
cells/ml) in 60-mm plastic tissue culture dishes in complete medium
for 2 h at 37°C in 10% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by
gently washing three times with warm RPMI 1630 (GIBCO BRL, Grand
Island, NY) containing 5% FCS and used as a source of T cells. The
remaining adherent cells (peripheral blood monocytes with small num￾bers of dendritic cells) were then harvested by washing with iced PBS
three times and resuspended in complete medium at a concentration of
1 x 106 cells/ml.
Preparation of CD8-depleted T cells. Nonadherent cells were col￾lected and resuspended in RPMI 1630 containing 10% human AB+
serum, then incubated on nylon wool columns for 1 h at 37°C. The T
cells were collected by eluting the column with 2 vol of RPMI 1630
plus 10% serum. T cells were further purified by the addition of OKT8
mAb (anti-CD8) and L243 mAb (anti-class II MHC), incubation for

Purified CD4+ T cells were cultured with TT (10 jig/ml) and the indi￾cated APC type. The proliferative response was determined by the incor￾poration of [3H]thymidine over the last 18 h of a 6-d culture. The means
are expressed as cpm±SE. The mean of the response induced by alveolar
macrophages was significantly different from the mean of the response
induced by peripheral blood monocytes, with P < 0.0008, using a
standard two-tailed paired t test.

washed in RPMI 1630 plus 5% FCS and used in complete medium at
a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml.
Cell culture/proliferation assay. Alveolar macrophages (5 x 104/
well) and/or peripheral blood monocytes (5 x 104/well) were cultured
with the purified CD8 - T cells (1 x 105/well) in triplicate in 96-well
flat-bottom culture plates with TT (10 ,ig/ml) and/or cytokines. After
5 d, cultures were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 jiCi/well) and har￾vested 18 h later. Incorporation of [3H ] thymidine was determined by
standard liquid scintillation techniques.
Results
Antigen presentation by alveolar macrophages is defective. We
assessed the ability of alveolar macrophages to present antigen
to autologous purified peripheral blood CD4 + T cells. Alveolar
macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage from the
lungs of TT-immune individuals (subjects were boosted with
TT within the past 5 yr), and were cultured with purified autolo￾gous CD4+ T cells and TT for 6 d. The proliferative response
of the T cells was quantitated by examining the incorporation
of [3H] thymidine over the last 18 h of culture. Table I shows
that the magnitude of the proliferation induced in autologous T
cells by alveolar macrophages was only - 20% of that induced
by an equal number of peripheral blood adherent cells. This
indicated that alveolar macrophages were much less effective
at inducing antigen-specific proliferation in autologous CD4 + T
cells than circulating PBMC from which alveolar macrophages
derive (1). The decreased effectiveness of the macrophages at
inducing T cell proliferation could not be improved by changing

Purified CD4+ T cells (1 x 105/well) were cultured with peripheral blood monocytes (5 x 104/well) or alveolar macrophages (5 x 104/well)
in triplicate with TT (10 ug/ml). GM-CSF (20 ng/ml), IFN-y (1,000 U/ml), IL-12 (50 U/ml), or anti-IL-10 mAb (5 ,ug/ml) was added to the
cultures. Cultures were pulsed with [3H] thymidine on day S and harvested on day 6 of culture. Results are representative of four experiments. The

the number of macrophages per culture (1 x 104, 2 x 104, 5
x 104, or 1 x iOs APC/culture), and cultures with higher
antigen concentrations had a slightly reduced proliferative re￾sponse. When alveolar macrophages were mixed with periph￾eral blood monocytes, alveolar macrophages appeared to inhibit
the T cell proliferative response induced with peripheral blood
monocytes, but the inhibition was slight and not reproducible.
Anti-IL-10 and IL-12 have no effect on antigen presenta￾tion by alveolar macrophages. Since macrophages have been
shown to produce IL- 10 and since this cytokine has been shown
to be inhibitory for T cell proliferative responses (15, 16), we
asked if the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb to the cultures might
enhance the proliferative response induced by alveolar macro￾phages. Fig. 1 shows that the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb had
no effect on the T cell proliferative response induced by alveolar
macrophages. Furthermore, addition of other cytokines such as
IFN-y or GM-CSF or of IL-12, which in other systems have
been shown to have beneficial effects on T cell proliferation
(17-19), also had no significant effect on the capacity of alveo￾lar macrophages to induce T cell proliferation. Addition of IL￾4 to the cultures or pretreatment of alveolar macrophages for
24 h with GM-CSF before culture also had no effect on T
cell proliferation induced by alveolar macrophages (data not
shown). These results suggest that inadequate amounts of GM￾CSF or IL-12 were not directly involved in limiting the ability
of alveolar macrophages to activate T cells.
Antigen presentation by alveolar macrophages is greatly
enhanced by the addition ofanti-CD28 mAb. Inasmuch as cross￾linking of the CD28 antigen on T cells has been shown to
provide a potent costimulatory signal, we hypothesized that
alveolar macrophages might be deficient in their capacity to
cross-link CD28 on T cells. Anti-CD28 mAb was therefore
added to cultures of alveolar macrophages and purified autolo￾gous T cells to provide help in cross-linking CD28 and stimulat￾ing T cell proliferation. Fig. 2 shows that alveolar macrophages
were significantly less effective than peripheral blood mono￾cytes/adherent cells in presenting TT to autologous T cells, but
that in the presence of anti-CD28, alveolar macrophages became
significantly more competent at inducing TT-specific prolifera￾tion. Addition of anti-CD28 mAb alone in the absence of anti￾gen did not induce T cell proliferation. Similar results were
obtained using soluble anti-CD3 mAb instead of TT to cross￾link the T cell receptor/CD3 complex, in that alveolar macro￾phages, which can display anti-CD3 mAb via cell surface Fcy
receptors, were ineffective at inducing anti-CD3 mAb mediated
T cell proliferation. However, when anti-CD28 mAb was added
to the cultures with soluble anti-CD3 mAb, the alveolar macro￾phages induced T cell proliferation that was equal in magnitude
to that observed in response to anti-CD3 mAb with peripheral
blood monocytes/adherent cells as APC (Fig. 2). These results
indicate that alveolar macrophages are ineffective at activating
T cells because they cannot provide the CD28 costimulatory
signal to T cells.
Alveolar macrophages are defective in their expression of
the costimulator molecules B7-1 and B7-2. To explain the lack
of CD28 costimulatory ability of alveolar macrophages, we di￾rectly examined the expression by alveolar macrophages of the
cell surface molecules B7-2 and B7-1, which bind to CD28 on
T cells. Fig. 3 shows that alveolar macrophages activated by
overnight incubation in IFN-y did not express B7-2, although
B7-2 was expressed at low levels on resting alveolar macro￾phages from 50% of subjects (absent on macrophages from the
other 50% of subjects), when stained immediately after isola￾tion. In contrast, peripheral blood monocytes activated with
IFN-y expressed substantially increased quantities of B7-2,
above the significant levels already expressed on resting mono￾cytes. Expression of B7-1 on alveolar macrophages was also
anomalous compared with that on peripheral blood monocytes,
in that resting alveolar macrophages expressed little or no B7-

abolished after incubation of the macrophages with IFN-y (Fig.
3) or by culture with T cells and antigen (data not shown). In
contrast, little or no B7-1 was expressed by resting peripheral
blood monocytes (very low levels of B7-1 were present on
monocytes from 50% of subjects), but expression was signifi￾cantly enhanced after incubation of the monocytes with IFN--y
(Fig. 3) (8) and by culture with T cells and antigen (data not
shown).
Because IL-10 inhibits expression of B7-1 and B7-2 in
monocytes (20, 21), and because alveolar macrophages may
produce significant quantities of IL-10, we cultured alveolar
macrophages in the presence of anti-IL-10 mAb and IFN-y.
After overnight culture, expression of B7-1 and B7-2 on alveo￾lar macrophages was still absent (data not shown), consistent
with our observations that anti-IL-10 mAb had minimal effect
on the capacity of the macrophages to stimulate T cell prolifera￾tion (Fig. 1), and indicating that B7-1 and B7-2 expression was
not directly inhibited by elevated production of IL-10 in our
cultures.
Discussion
The mechanisms that limit the capacity of alveolar macrophages
to activate T cells are poorly understood, but could be due to the
failure of alveolar macrophages to provide sufficient activation
signals to T cells. Activation of CD4+ T cells, evidenced by
proliferation and cytokine production, requires at least two sig￾naling events: one triggered by the ligation and cross-linking
of the T cell receptor complex by antigen peptide/class II MHC
on the APC; the other signaling event generated by the ligation
and cross-linking of T cell costimulatory molecules, e.g., CD28,
by counterreceptors (e.g., B7-1 and B7-2) on APC such as
macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (7, 8, 11, 22). The
ligation of the CD28 antigen on T cells provides an extremely
important signal that upregulates the synthesis of IL-2 and IFN-
-y in T cells (23-25) and prevents the induction of T cell anergy
or tolerance (12, 13, 26-28).
In our studies, we examined the failure of alveolar macro￾phages to activate T cells and determined the role of B7-1 and
B7-2 on alveolar macrophages in this failure. We found that
the inability of alveolar macrophages to activate T cells was
not due to a failure to process antigen, since alveolar macro￾phages could induce a TT-specific proliferative response when
a costimulatory signal was provided by anti-CD28 mAb. Fur￾thermore, the inability of alveolar macrophages to activate T
cells was not due to a failure to process antigen, because alveolar
macrophages could not activate T cells via anti-CD3 mAb,
which directly ligates the T cell receptor/CD3 complex and is
independent of antigen processing. Inasmuch as the failure of
alveolar macrophages to activate T cells was reversed by the
addition of anti-CD28 mAb, and since activated alveolar macro￾phages failed to express B7-1 and B7-2 antigens, we suggest
that the sole reason for the failure of alveolar macrophages to
activate T cells is their inability to provide costimulation via
the CD28 pathway.
The mechanism by which alveolar macrophages, long-lived
phagocytic cells that derive from peripheral blood monocytes
(1), paradoxically limit their expression of B7-1 and B7-2 is
not clear. IL-10 has been shown previously to downregulate
B7-1 expression on macrophages (20, 21). Therefore the pro￾duction of IL- 10 in the lung might play a role in downregulating
B7 expression on alveolar macrophages, and in downregulating
inflammation, as it does in other tissues, particularly in the
intestinal tract, where recent studies indicate that ablation of
IL-10 expression results in severe inflammatory bowel disease
(29). In our experiments the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb to
cultures of alveolar macrophages for > 24 h did not enhance
the expression of B7-1 and B7-2 and did not enhance antigen
presentation by alveolar macrophages. It is possible, however,
that anti-IL-10 mAb had no effect in vitro because a potent
IL-10 signal occurred in vivo, or that more prolonged in vitro

culture of alveolar macrophages in the presence of anti-IL-10

macrophages.
We observed that resting alveolar macrophages from some
individuals expressed low levels of B7- 1 or B7-2 (Fig. 3).

The limited expression of B7-1 or B7-2 by resting alveolar
macrophages may permit the induction of limited T cell prolifer￾ation (- 20% of that observed with peripheral blood mono￾cytes, Table I) and may permit alveolar macrophages to induce
proliferation in already activated T cells and in T cell clones

(3, 5). However, in our studies, expression of B7-1 or B7-2 by
resting macrophages was ablated by activation with IFN-'y,
which is in direct contrast with our results with peripheral blood
monocytes, which expressed increased quantities of B7-1 and
B7-2 when activated (7, 9, 10). This is consistent with our
observations that IFN-'y, which greatly increased class II MHC
expression on PBMC, did not increase class II MHC expression
on alveolar macrophages (data not shown). Thus taken to￾gether, these observations indicate that B7-1 and B7-2 expres￾sion is regulated differently in alveolar macrophages than in
peripheral blood monocytes and suggest that the role of alveolar
macrophages in immune responses is distinct from that of other
types of APC, i.e., alveolar macrophages may be involved in
the induction of peripheral tolerance rather than in the activation
of T cells.
In the lungs and in the intestinal tract, antigen exposure has
been shown previously to cause immunological tolerance (26,
30-32). Although these mucosal surfaces are continuously ex￾posed to abundant quantities of antigen, immune responsiveness
must be restricted or downregulated at these sites since inflam￾matory reactions inevitably produce significant damage to the
mucosal surface. The mechanisms responsible for the induction
of oral/mucosal tolerance have not been fully elucidated, but
are thought to involve the generation of active suppression or
the induction of clonal anergy (33-38). Although it is thought
that antigen dose can modulate oral tolerance (33), in view of
the fact that antigen presentation in vitro in the absence of B7
costimulation results in T cell unresponsiveness or tolerance
(12, 13, 26-28), we suggest that the principal mechanism that
regulates the induction of peripheral tolerance in vivo (in lung
and bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue or in gut-associated
lymphoid tissue [30, 39]) is the restriction of B7-1 and B7-2
expression on APC. Moreover, we suggest that alveolar macro￾phages, which have reduced expression of B7-1 and B7-2, play
a major role in downregulating immune responses in the lung
and in inducing immunological tolerance to inhaled antigens.
In this regard, preliminary studies in our laboratory indicate
that alveolar macrophages can indeed induce antigen-specific
tolerance in peripheral blood T cells (Hwang, P. T., et al.,
manuscript in preparation).
Since alveolar macrophages are limited in their capacity to
initiate inflammatory responses, how are antigen-specific im￾mune responses elicited in the lung? This is not necessarily a
problem, since dendritic cells, which are present in the peribron￾chial connective tissues (but not on the epithelial surface in the
lung nor in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid [40]), as well as
neutrophils, can be recruited into the lung quite readily (41).
However, the balance between activation of immune responses
by dendritic cells and the inhibition of inflammatory responses
by alveolar macrophages is precarious: overly zealous inhibition
may result in overwhelming infection, whereas insufficient inhi￾bition may result in allergic or inflammatory disease. Nonethe￾less, alveolar macrophages appear well suited to defend the
lung, since they are very efficient at phagocytizing antigen and
microorganisms but at the same time are ineffective at activating
T cells and initiating inflammatory responses.
