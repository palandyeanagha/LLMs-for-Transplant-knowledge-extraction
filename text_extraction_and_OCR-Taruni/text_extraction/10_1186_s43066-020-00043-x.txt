Recent advances in non-invasive diagnosis
and medical management of non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease in adult
Jayanta Paul
Abstract
Background: Number of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cases is increasing over time due to
alteration of food habit, increase incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lack of exercise. Liver biopsy is the
test for diagnosis and staging of NAFLD, but nowadays several biochemical markers, scoring systems, and
imaging studies are available to diagnose and stage NAFLD which is linked to end-stage liver disease,
hepatocellular cancer, and elevated cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore
urgent diagnosis and management are required to avoid complications related to NAFLD. This review
summarizes recent advances in diagnosis and medical management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Main text: Recently published studies from PubMed, Red Cross, Copernicus, and also various previous studies
were reviewed. We have discussed various non-invasive methods for detection of non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic fibrosis. Non pharmacological therapies for NAFLD,
indications, and approved medications for NAFLD and other commonly used non-approved medications have
been discussed in this review article.
Conclusions: Multiple non-invasive tests are available for diagnosis of NAFLD, and its different stages
however gold standard test is liver biopsy. NALFD without NASH and significant fibrosis is treated by lifestyle
modifications which include moderate to vigorous exercise and diet modification. To improve hepatic
steatosis, minimum of 3–5% of body weight loss is necessary, but > 7–10% weight reductions is required for
histological improvement in NASH and fibrosis. Pharmacotherapy is indicated when patient is having NASH
with significant fibrosis.

Medical management of NAFLD
Background
Incidence and prevalence of “Non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease” (NAFLD) is increasing over time mainly due to
bad food habit, weight gain, and sedentary lifestyle.
NAFLD is the most common cause of abnormal liver
function tests (LFTs) in the UK [1]. In the USA, preva￾lence of NAFLD is in between 10 and 30%, which is
similar to Asia and Europe [2, 3]. Singh et al. in 2004 [4]
showed that 24.5% of healthy attendants had evidence of
fatty liver on abdominal ultrasound. NAFLD is com￾monly associated with one or more component of meta￾bolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and
dyslipidemia and is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% hep￾atic steatosis in histological examination without evi￾dence of hepatocellular injury such as hepatocyte
ballooning [5]. Around 20% of patients with NAFLD de￾velop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which may
progress to cirrhosis [6], however most common cause
of death in NAFLD patients is cardiovascular disease,

and NAFLD is the third most common cause of hepato￾cellular carcinoma [5]. “Burned out” NAFLD can be a
hidden cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. So, early diagno￾sis, and treatment of NAFLD and underlying predispos￾ing factors are important to avoid liver damage which
may progress to liver failure.
Diagnosis
Liver biopsy is the gold standard test for diagnosis, grad￾ing, and histological assessment of NAFLD, and a four￾point histopathologic grading system is used to assess
severity of steatosis that ranges from 0 to 3, depending
on presence of the percentage of fat-containing hepato￾cytes (Table 1) [7]. But the value of a liver biopsy for the
diagnosis of NAFLD in routine clinical practice is con￾troversial, especially in the presence of a generally good
prognosis for most patients with NAFLD, the lack of an
established form of effective therapy, and the risks and
costs associated with the liver biopsy.
Before considering the diagnosis of NAFLD, alcoholic
fatty liver has to be excluded. Significant alcohol intake
is considered when alcohol consumption > 7 standard
drinks/week (70 g ethanol) in women and > 14 (140 g
ethanol) in men (according to Asia-Pacific Guidelines)
or > 21 standard drink on average per week in men and
> 14 standard drink per week in women (according to
AASLD guidelines) or > 30 g/day in men and > 20 g/day
in women (according to EASL guideline). One standard
drink in Asia specific area and Europe is roughly 10 gms
of pure alcohol, however in USA it is 14 gms of pure al￾cohol. Therefore, patient should not take significant al￾cohol before diagnosis of NAFLD.
Non-invasive tests for diagnosis of hepatic
steatosis
Imagings for diagnosis of hepatic steatosis
A. Abdominal ultrasonography: Usually, “Hepatic
steatosis” is diagnosed incidentally by abdominal
ultrasonography (USG) which detect the increased
echogenicity of the liver and divides fatty liver into
three grades (Table 1) [8]. To identify hepatic
steatosis, USG has sensitivity from 60 to 94% and
specificity from 84 to 95% [9], and sensitivity is
more than 90% when liver biopsy shows > 20%
steatosis [10] (Fig. 1). Hepatorenal index of 1.34 or
higher has sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 85%
for identifying steatosis > 5% [11]. Another semi￾quantitative score (ultrasonographic fatty liver indi￾cator) which requires the presence of liver/kidney
contrast (brighter liver than kidney) among other
parameters can detect NAFLD when score ≥ 2 [12].
USG has several advantages (non-invasive test,
widely available, low cost, quick diagnosis) and dis￾advantages (degree of fibrosis cannot be detected,
low sensitivity when steatosis is less than 20%, and
limited use in obese individuals) for detection of
fatty liver.
B. Controlled attenuation parameter: Transient
elastography is an ultrasound-based study and also
known as vibration-controlled transient elastogra￾phy or Fibroscan which can measure controlled at￾tenuation parameter (CAP). CAP which ranges
from 100 to 400 decibels per meter (dB/m) can de￾tect significant hepatic steatosis, but it is less accur￾ate to distinguish between the different grades of
hepatic steatosis [13]. However other studies indi￾cate that CAP score is well correlated with steatosis
grades in real-world clinical practice [14–16]. The
optimal cut-off values of CAP for estimation of hep￾atic steatosis grades such as S1, S2, and S3 are ≥
263dB/m, ≥ 281dB/m and ≥ 283dB/m respectively
[13]. Another study also graded hepatic steatosis de￾pending on CAP value into S1 ≥ 238 dB/m, S2 ≥
260 dB/m, and S3 ≥ 293 dB/m [17]. It does not pre￾dict liver-related events, non-hepatocellular carcin￾oma cancers, and cardiovascular events [18]. CAP
showed excellent diagnostic performance for differ￾entiating presence and absence of hepatic steatosis
by using a cutoff value of 241 dB/m in children with
NAFLD but has limited value in evaluating grades
of steatosis, especially in children with high BMI (>
30 kg/m2
) [19]. Before recommendation for hepatic
steatosis measurement, CAP needs further
validation.
C. Computed tomography (CT scan): Decreased
attenuation of hepatic parenchyma compared to
intrahepatic vessels, spleen, and kidney is detected
in NAFLD by both contrast-enhanced and non￾contrast CT scan. When hepatic density is higher
than spleen, hepatic steatosis can be excluded.

Hepatic steatosis can be detected in CT scan of the
abdomen when spleen attenuation > liver attenu￾ation or when liver attenuation value < 48 Houns￾field units (HU) [20]. Moderate-to-severe hepatic
steatosis can be identified with a specificity of 100%
when liver attenuation value is < 40–42 HU and
hepatic-spleenic attenuation ratio is < 0.8 [21].
Qualitative evaluation of the liver on a portal ven￾ous phase contrast-enhanced CT is highly specific
to detect hepatic steatosis, but sensitivity (around
60%) is low. CT scan has several limitations such as
limited accuracy to detect mild degree hepatic stea￾tosis, risk of radiation exposure, high cost, and
availability. CT scan is commonly used to detect
hepatic steatosis for living liver donor candidate
[22]. Dual energy CT (DECT) findings are strongly
correlated with histopathologic findings in cases of
steatosis and can allow rapid, accurate evaluations
of hepatic steatosis.
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI is
considered as the most definitive imaging study for
qualitative and quantitative assessment of hepatic
steatosis. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI to
detect histologically confirmed hepatic steatosis are
76.7 to 90.0% and 87.1 to 91%, respectively [7, 23].
Frequency-selective MRI, chemical-shift-encoded
MRI, MR spectroscopy, and magnetic resonance
elastography techniques are usually used to assess
hepatic fat content [24]. In MRI, both in-phase (IP)
and out-of-phase (OOP) imaging to be adequately
assessed to detect fatty liver (FL), and in out-of￾phase image FL appears as hyper intense (in T1
image), mildly hyper intense (in T2 image), and sig￾nal droop out (signal loss is demonstrated when
there is 10–15% fat fraction with maximum signal
loss occurring when there is 50% fatty infiltration of
the liver). Advantages of MRI-based detection of
fatty liver are no radiation exposure; high diagnostic
accuracy; can detect fat as low as 5–10%; operator
independent; highly responsive to changes in steato￾sis throughout parenchyma; and not significantly
impacted by demographics, histologic activity, or
co-existing hepatic conditions. It has the following
disadvantages: high cost and taking long time.
Hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non￾invasive technique which can diagnose and quantify
hepatic steatosis into three grades, and H-MHS
thresholds correspond with histopathologic grading
of steatosis and may obviate liver biopsy (Table 2)
[25]. 1H-MRS allows the direct measurement of the
area under the lipid resonance peak. This test result
is not modified by the presence of confounding fac￾tors such as fibrosis, iron overload, and glycogen.
Main drawbacks of H-MHS are high cost, less
availability, complex technique requiring patient co￾operation, samples only a small portion of the entire
liver, and not well validated and still considered a
research tool.
Proton density fat fraction (PDFF) in MRI is also
used for quantifying hepatic steatosis. PDFF is an
accurate marker of hepatic steatosis and allows
discriminating with a good diagnostic accuracy
between different grades of hepatic steatosis [26].
The accuracy of PDFF measurement using chemical
shift-encoded methods is similar to that of MRS.
Recently, hepatic phosphorus-31 MRS (31P-MRS)
is proposed in different studies as a potential
marker to detect distinct biochemical changes in
different NAFLD states. It shows promise in the dif￾ferentiation of NAFLD stages [27].
E. Xenon–133 liver scan: Xe-133 liver scan is a safe,
reliable, non-invasive method with low radiation ex￾posure to detect and quantify hepatic steatosis, and
is superior to ultrasound with a sensitivity of 94.3%
and specificity of 87.5% [28]. Compared with other
imaging investigations, Xe-133 scan is more accur￾ate to detect mild grade of steatosis [28]. One major
limitation of Xe-133 scan is that it only detects fat;
therefore, it is not expected to distinguish between
different subtypes of NAFLD and does not provide
information of liver morphology. The usefulness of
Xe-133 scan in the diagnosis of NAFLD has not
been well studied till now (Fig. 1).
Non-invasive scoring systems for diagnosis of hepatic
steatosis
There is no single laboratory marker that can be used for
the diagnosis of NAFLD. Gamma-glutamyltransferase
(GGT) in the serum is frequently elevated in NAFLD pa￾tients and associated with increased mortality [29], however
does not help in diagnosis of NAFLD. Alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels
are not sensitive for diagnosis of NAFLD. Following scoring
systems are available to identify NAFLD.
A. NAFLD liver fat score (NLFS): The NAFLD liver fat
score is estimated by using the presence of the
metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, fasting serum
insulin level, fasting serum AST, and the AST/ALT
Table 2 Hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopy grading of fatty liver
Grading of fatty liver Hydrogen-1 MR spectroscopy findings
Grade 0 steatosis Proton density fat fraction threshold of less
than 17.0%
Grade 1 steatosis Proton density fat fraction threshold of 17.0–
38.6%
Grade 2 or greater
steatosis
Proton density fat fraction threshold greater
than 38.6%
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 4 of 18

ratio [30]. NLFS value > − 0.640 has a sensitivity of
86% and specificity of 71% to identify hepatic
steatosis > 5.56% [30]. However, by this scoring
system, different stages of NAFLD cannot be
distinguished. This score provide simple and non￾invasive tool to predict NAFLD and liver fat con￾tent. Higher NLFS is associated with increased liver
disease mortality but not with other mortality out￾comes [31].
B. Fatty liver index (FLI): Fatty liver index is a suitable
and simple predictor for hepatic steatosis. FLI is
calculated by measuring waist circumference, body
mass index, serum triglyceride, and gamma￾glutamyltransferase [32]. Score varies from zero to
100. Fatty liver index < 30 rules out fatty liver, but
value ≥ 60 rules in fatty liver with a sensitivity and
specificity of 86% and 87%, respectively [32]. FLI in￾dependently associates with overall, cardiovascular
and cancer-related mortality. FLI can serve as a sur￾rogate marker for hepatic steatosis and metabolic
syndrome in type 1 diabetes [33].
C. Hepatic steatosis index (HSI): It is a simple,
effective NAFLD screening tool derived by a logistic
regression model. It includes gender, history of
T2DM, body mass index (BMI), alanine
transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase
(AST). HSI is calculated by the following formula: 8
× (ALT/AST ratio) + BMI (addition of +2 if female;
+2 if diabetes mellitus) [33]. HSI value < 30
excludes NAFLD with 93.1% sensitivity and value >
36 detects NAFLD with a specificity of 92.4% [23].
It may be utilized for selecting individuals for
hepatic USG and for determining the need of
lifestyle modifications.
D. Lipid accumulation product (LAP): It is significantly
associated with the presence of liver steatosis and
has a high diagnostic accuracy to identify NAFLD
in the general population, and diagnostic accuracy
is higher in young age group individuals [34, 35].
Following calculation is used to measure LAP:
[waist circumference (cm) − 65] × triglyceride
concentration (mmol//L) in men and [waist
circumference (cm) − 58] × triglyceride
concentration (mmol/L) in women [35]. Cutoff
values of LAP in men and women are 30.5
(sensitivity 77%, specificity 75%) and 23.0
(sensitivity 82%, specificity 79%), respectively [35].
Although this is a very simple and low cost test, it
needs further validation before recommendation.
Lipid accumulation product can also predict
metabolic syndrome in individuals without fatty
liver disease [36].
E. SteatoTest: SteatoTest includes ten components
such as serum α2-macroglobulin, apo A1,
haptoglobin, total bilirubin, GGT, ALT, body mass
index, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose
adjusted for age and gender. It is a simple and non￾invasive method to identify liver steatosis and may
reduce the need for liver biopsy, particularly in pa￾tients with component of metabolic syndrome [37].
A cutoff of 0.30 has 90% sensitivity, and a cutoff of
0.72 has 90% specificity to diagnose hepatic steatosis
[37]. It needs further validation before
recommendation.
F. NAFL screening score: It is a model to detect
NAFLD with the following six components: age,
fasting blood glucose, BMI, triglyceride, ALT/AST,
and uric acid. The lower cutoff value with a
sensitivity of 92% and negative predictive value of
95% is 0.24, and the high cutoff value with 90%
specificity and 84% positive predictive value is 0.44
[38].
Non-invasive tests for diagnosis of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH)
NASH can progress to cirrhosis and its complications
such as portal hypertension, liver failure, and hepatocellu￾lar carcinoma. Cirrhosis develops in 21 to 28% of NASH
patients compared to only 3% of patients with non￾alcoholic fatty liver. The gold standard for diagnosis of
NASH is liver biopsy. But liver biopsy is an invasive pro￾cedure and has several complications, non-invasive tests
has been developed for diagnosis of NASH (Fig. 2).
Serum biomarkers
A. Serum cytokeratin (CK)-18: It is a marker of
hepatocyte apoptosis, most widely investigated for
diagnosis of NASH and is the most consistent
single parameter for differentiating steatosis from
NASH [39]. Cutoff value of CK-18 > 240 U/L has a
sensitivity of 76.7% and specificity of 95.0% for diag￾nosis of NASH [40]. Another study showed that op￾timal cutoff point of serum CK-18-fragments for
definite NASH was 270 U/L with sensitivity and
specificity of 64% and 76%, respectively [41].
B. Serum aminotransferases: It is commonly used in
clinical practice as a surrogate marker for liver
inflammation but has poor predictive value for
diagnosis of NASH [5]. Serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) value > 2 times the upper
limit of normal (> 70 U/L) has a sensitivity of 50%
and specificity of 61% for NASH detection [42], but
~ 80% of patients with fatty liver have shown ALT
levels within normal limits [43]. Aminotransferase
levels do not correlate with the degree of hepatic
fibrosis. Liver enzymes should not be used for
detection of NASH. Further studies are required to
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 5 of 18

Fig. 2 Non invasive tests for diagnosis of non alcoholic steatohepatitis
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 6 of 18

find out cutoff value of liver enzymes to prevent
unnecessary diagnostic work-ups and early detec￾tion of NASH.
C. Serum adiponectin: Adiponectin is exclusively
synthesized by adipose tissue and involves in
glucose and lipid metabolism. It is a negative
predictor of NASH in fatty liver patients with a
cutoff value 29.16 μg/L [44].
D. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21): Serum FGF21
level correlates with severity of steatohepatitis in
patients with NASH, and its level may help to
identify patients who are having highest risk of
disease progression. Plasma FGF21 was higher in
patients with NASH with mean value of 453 ± 262
pg/mL when compared to patients without NASH
[45]. To improve the positive predictive value (PPV)
and negative predictive value (NPV) of FGF21, CK￾18 is combined with FGF21, which improves the
PPV to 82% and NPV to 74% [46].
E. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9): Hepatocytes secrete PCSK9 which inhibits
the uptake of low-density lipoproteins by targeting
the receptor for degradation and possibly lipogen￾esis. In a recent study, Paquette et al. described
strong association between PCSK9 and liver bio￾markers as well as hepatic steatosis [47]. Circulating
PCSK9 increases with hepatic fat accumulation and
also correlates with the severity of steatosis [48].
F. Plasma pentraxin 3(PTX3): Higher serum
concentration of pentraxin 3 protein is seen in
patients with more advanced stages of NAFLD, and
higher values are correlated with advanced stages of
the hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, serum PTX3 level
could be used as a marker to assess severity of
hepatic fibrosis [49].
G. Malondialdehyde (MDA): High serum level of
malondialdehyde is seen in type 2 diabetes patients
with NASH than without NASH [50]. MDA can
stimulate hepatic stellate cells and result in fibrosis.
H. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α): Tilg et al.
described that TNF-α is elevated in serum of those
with NASH [51]. Patients with high level of TNF-α
have increased burden of NAFLD and higher ad￾verse hepatic event risk compared to patients with
low level of TNF-α [51].
I. Interleukin-6 (IL-6): Elevated serum IL-6 is asso￾ciated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting
NAFLD. IL-6 is positively correlated with severity
of hepatocyte inflammation, stage of fibrosis in
patients with NASH [52]. However, Yoneda et al.
in their study did not find any increase in ex￾pression of IL-6 in patients with steatohepatitis
as compared to patients with simple hepatic
steatosis [53].
Non-invasive scoring systems for diagnosis of
steatohepatitis (NASH)
A. NASH test: NASH test is a simple and non-invasive
scoring system to predict the presence or absence
of NASH in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease [54]. It includes 13 components (age, sex,
height, weight, serum levels of triglycerides, choles￾terol, a2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, hapto￾globin, g-glutamyltransferase, aminotransferases
ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) to identify NASH
and divide NASH into three categories: NASH
(AUROC of 0.79), Borderline NASH (AUROC of
0.69), and No-NASH (AUROC of 0.77–0.83) [55].
B. HAIR score: This score depends on the following
parameters: hypertension, alanine aminotransferase
[ALT] level, and insulin resistance. The presence of
at least two of the three parameters provides the
best combination of sensitivity of 80% and
specificity of 89% for predicting NASH especially in
severely obese individuals [56].
C. NASH diagnostic index (NDI): This index is
calculated by serum insulin, glucose, triglycerides,
ALT, and waist-to-hip ratio. By using a value ≥ 22,
NDI has a specificity of 82% for establishing a diag￾nosis of simple steatosis, and NDI has a specificity
of 86% for diagnosing NASH when value is ≥ 50
[57].
D. NICE model: A simple and non-invasive composite
model includes metabolic syndrome (MS), CK-18,
and serum ALT level. This model is designed to
diagnose NASH in morbidly obese patients. The
equation of “Nice model” is: − 5.654 + 3.780E−02 ×
ALT (IU/L) + 2.215E−03 × CK18 fragment levels
(IU/L) + 1.825 × (presence of MS = 1) [58]. The
best cutoff value is 0.14 for diagnosis of NASH and
this value is associated with 84% sensitivity, 86%
specificity, 44% positive predictive value, and 98%
negative predictive value.
E. Palekar score: It was proposed to distinguish NASH
from steatosis. This scoring system includes the
following risk factors: age ≥ 50 years, female gender,
AST ≥ 45 IU/L, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 mg/
kg2, AST/ALT ratio ≥ 0.80, and hyaluronic acid ≥
55 μg/L. The presence of three or more risk factors
has 73.7% sensitivity and 65.7% specificity to
distinguish NASH from steatosis [59].
F. NAFIC score: This score is used by using ferritin,
fasting insulin, and type IV collagen 7S for
predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in NAFLD
patients [60].
G. NASH ClinLipMet score: This test is used by
utilizing serum AST value, fasting insulin value,
PNPLA3 genotype, glutamate, isoleucine, glycine,
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 7 of 18

lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, and
phosphoethanolamine 40:6. The sensitivity of this
scoring system is 75% [55]. This test is usually used
in research because of high cost.
H. NASH predictive index (NPI): This index is used by
using age, female gender, body mass index (BMI),
homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of insulin
resistance, and log [aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) × ALT]. For predicting the presence of
NASH, this index is promising (AUROC of 0.87 to
0.90) but lacks external validation [61].
I. Other scoring systems: Gholam score (AST and
diabetes mellitus) [62] and oxNASH (13-hydroxyl￾octadecadienoic acid/linoleic acid ratio, age, BMI,
and AST) score > 72 were 10 times more likely to
have NASH compared to those with oxNASH score
< 47 [63], and a clinical score by Chunming et al.
[64] including ALT, gamma-glutamyl transpepti￾dase, C-reactive protein, and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio,
NASH Score [65] (AST, PNPLA3 genotype and
fasting insulin) were studied for identification of
NASH.
Breath test for diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
A study showed that analyzing three volatile organic
compounds (n-tridecane, 3-methyl-butanonitrile, and 1-
propanol) in the exhaled breath were sufficient to distin￾guish patients with NASH from without NASH with
negative and positive predictive values of 82% and 81%,
respectively [66].
Imagings for diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Routine imaging techniques (Ultrasonography, CT, or
MRI) are unable to differentiate NASH from simple
steatosis.
A. Proton magnetic resonance (1H-MRS): This
method is studied in detecting NASH with a
sensitivity of 87.4% and specificity of 74.3% [67].
B. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE): MRE can
accurately identify NASH prior to fibrosis and
differentiate NASH from NAFL with a sensitivity of
94% and specificity 73% by using a threshold of
2.74 kPa [68]. But it needs further validation.
Non-invasive tests for diagnosis of hepatic
fibrosis:
Stages of liver fibrosis are the most important factor for
the prognosis of NAFLD and predicting the risk of pro￾gression to cirrhosis and its complications. There are
several predictive models available to identify hepatic fi￾brosis (Fig. 3).
Non-invasive scoring systems for diagnosis of hepatic
fibrosis
A. AST/platelet ratio index (APRI): This is measured
by using the patient’s AST level, upper limit of
normal AST value, and platelet count. APRI cutoff
of ≥ 0.7 has a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of
72% to detect significant hepatic fibrosis (≥ F2 by
Metavir) and a cutoff score of at least 1.0 has a
sensitivity of 61 to 76% and specificity of 64 to 72%
for detection of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (F3 to F4
by Metavir) [69]. APRI has a good negative
predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis but
does not accurately differentiate intermediate
fibrosis from mild or severe fibrosis.
B. FIB-4: It is a simple, accurate, and inexpensive
method for assessing liver fibrosis and includes the
following components: age, platelet count, AST, and
ALT. It is calculated by using [age (years) × AST
(U/L)]/[number of platelets (109
/L) × ALT (U/L)
(1/2)] formula. An FIB-4 score > 3.25 has a positive
predictive value of 82.1% with a specificity of 98.2%
to confirm the existence of a significant fibrosis (F3-
F4 by Metavir) [70]. FIB-4 has high negative pre￾dictive value (> 90%) for ruling out advanced fibro￾sis when score is < 1.45.
C. BARD score: This is calculated by using the sum of
3 variables (BMI ≥ 28 = 1 point, AST-to-ALT Ratio
≥ 0.8 = 2 points, the presence of diabetes = 1 point),
and score ≥ 2 is associated with advanced fibrosis
[71]. Due to its simplicity, it is popular among gen￾eral practitioners, However due to its low positive
predictive value (< 42%) it includes many patients
without NASH/ fibrosis into high risk group and
limits its utility in clinical practice.
D. NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS): A simple scoring
system accurately separates NAFLD with and
without advanced fibrosis. It includes age,
hyperglycemia, body mass index, platelet count,
albumin, and AST/ALT ratio as variables. By using
low cutoff score of − 1.455, advanced hepatic
fibrosis could be excluded with high negative
predictive value of 93%, and by applying the high
cutoff score of 0.676, advanced hepatic fibrosis
could be diagnosed with high positive predictive
value of 90% [72]. Advantages of the NFS are as
follows: (1) its ability to provide prognostic
information and (2) identify NAFLD patients who
are at increased risk for liver-related complications
such as ascites and gastroesophageal varices or
death.
E. King’s score: The King’s score is a simple index for
predicting cirrhosis and calculated by the following
formula: age × AST (U/L) × INR/platelet count

(109
/L). Score of ≥ 16.7 predicts cirrhosis with
sensitivity 86%, specificity 80%, and a high negative
predictive value of 96% [73]. This score was initially
evaluated for diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients
with hepatitis C infection.
F. Fibrosis index score (FI): This is a simple index
to detect hepatic fibrosis noninvasively and
measured by “8 − 0.01 × number of platelets
(109
/L) − albumin (g/dL)” formula. Sensitivity
and positive predictive value of FI score ≥ 3.30
for the prediction of F4 is 70.8% and 81.0%,
respectively [74].
G. Cao et al. published a score by measuring CK-18,
ALT, platelets, and triglycerides that had significant
positive correlation with staging hepatic fibrosis
[75].
H. Egy-Score: This score is a useful non-invasive panel
of surrogate biomarkers that can accurately predict
stages of hepatic fibrosis. Egy-Score was calculated
by the following formula: 3.52 + 0.0063 × CA19-9 +
0.0203 × age + 0.4485 × alpha-2-macroglobulin +
0.0303 × bilirubin − 0.0048 × platelet − 0.0462 × al￾bumin [76].
I. Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) panel: It includes
three variables: hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 1, and aminoterminal peptide of
procollagen III. It has 3 cutoff values: (1) value 7.7
for exclusion of fibrosis, (2) value 9.8 for
identification of fibrosis with sensitivity of 69% and
specificity of 98% for moderate fibrosis, and (3)
value 11.3 to discriminate cirrhosis with 83%
sensitivity and specificity of 97% [77].
J. FibroTest: This is calculated by using five
biomarkers: haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, apoli￾poprotein A1, total bilirubin, and GGT. Cutoff
value of 0.30 has 90% negative predictive value
for advanced fibrosis with sensitivity of 77%, and
a cutoff value of 0.70 has a 73% positive predict￾ive value for advanced fibrosis with specificity of
98%. False positive result is seen in Gilbert’s syn￾drome, cholestasis, acute hemolysis, renal insuffi￾ciency, on medications that may cause
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and acute liver
inflammation [78].
K. Fibroindex: This simple scoring system is measured
by using the following three biochemical markers:
AST, platelet count, and gamma globulin. It has
good specificity for mild or significant fibrosis (94%
and 97% respectively) but has low sensitivity (40%
and 36% respectively) [79]. Due to its low
sensitivity, it is not an adequate tool to be used
alone for detection of hepatic fibrosis.
L. HepaScore: Age, sex, total bilirubin, GGT, alpha-2-
macroglobulin, and hyaluronic acid levels are used
to calculate HepaScore. Score ≤ 0.2 has 98% nega￾tive predictive value to exclude fibrosis and ≥ 0.8
has a positive predictive value of 62% to predict cir￾rhosis [80].
M. Forns index: It has the following components: age,
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), cholesterol, and
platelet count. Score < 4.25 has a negative predict￾ive value of 96% to exclude significant fibrosis and
value > 6.9 has positive predictive value of 66% for
diagnosis of significant fibrosis [81].
N. Fibrospect II: This test (including hyaluronic
acid, tissue inhibitor of a metalloproteinase-1
(TIMP-1), and alpha-2-macroglobulin as vari￾ables) can be used to predict stages of hepatic fi￾brosis (F2 to F4). Score > 0.42 indicates presence
of stage F2 to F4 fibrosis with sensitivity of
80.6% and specificity of 71.4% [82].
Imagings for diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis
A. Transient elastography (Fibroscan): This is an easy￾to-perform, non-invasive, day care procedure which
takes about 5 to 10 min and measures the velocity
of 50 MHz shear wave that is emitted by ultrasound
transducer probe and transmitted through hepatic
tissue. This velocity of share wave in the liver is
positively related to liver stiffness, and value ranges
from 1.5 to 75 kPa. Fibroscan examines a larger area
of liver tissue (1 cm diameter × 5 cm in length) than
liver biopsy and provides a more representative as￾sessment of the entire hepatic parenchyma. Two
types of probe are available to measure hepatic stiff￾ness: “M” probe is the most commonly used to
measure shear wave velocity, and “XL” probe is usu￾ally used in obese people to reduce the failure rate.
Cutoff value of < 8 kPa has a 94–100% negative pre￾dictive value to exclude significant hepatic fibrosis
[83], and cutoff values used to identify stages of
hepatic fibrosis are as follow: 7.1 kPa for F ≥ 2, 9.5
kPa for F ≥ 3, and 12.5 kPa for F4 [84]. Conditions
which increase liver stiffness without fibrosis are
acute hepatitis, hepatic congestion (e.g., in heart
failure), mass lesions within the liver, and cholesta￾sis. Failure or unreliable to take readings are seen
more frequently in the following patients: obesity
(BMI > 30–35 kg/m2
), older age, and presence of as￾cites. There are no absolute contraindications for
this test, however manufacturer also advises against
the use of this device in pregnancy and in patients
with a pacemaker and implantable defibrillators.
Despite these limitations, Fibroscan is one of the
more reliable non-invasive methods to estimate
liver fibrosis and is recommended during the man￾agement of NAFLD in the current guidelines [5].
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 10 of 18

B. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)
elastography: ARFI uses a conventional B-mode
ultrasonography probe which produces an acoustic
pulse. Hepatic stiffness is expressed as shear wave
velocity in meter per second (m/s) after calculating
the median for 10 successful measures. Using a pre￾dictive shear stiffness of 4.24 kPa, it distinguishes
low (fibrosis stage 0–2) from high (fibrosis stage 3–
4) fibrosis stages with a sensitivity of 90% and a spe￾cificity of 90% [85]. The advantages of ARFI are as
follows: (1) the acoustic energy pulse is not affected
by obesity or ascitic fluid, (2) specific regions of
interest can be focused during procedure to meas￾ure varying depths in specific areas of the liver, (3)
at the same time whole liver can be evaluated by
ultrasonography which is not possible with Fbros￾can. However, the presence of severe steatosis can
affect accuracy of ARFI [86].
C. Shear wave elastography (SWE): By using
conventional ultrasonography machine, SWE
estimates liver stiffness in the right lobe and
positively correlated with liver fibrosis severity and
can potentially differentiate intermediate degrees of
liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Shear waves
produced by a conventional ultrasound beam are
directly related to the hepatic stiffness and are
reported to be more accurate than transient
elastography in assessing significant fibrosis of the
liver (LS) (≥ F2) [87]. Hepatic stiffness is measured
in the right lobe of the liver, and measurement of
LS in the left lobe is inappropriate because it is
affected by cardiac pulsation. In healthy population,
liver stiffness value ranges in between 4.5 and 5.5
kPa [88]. Food intake increases LS value and results
in falsely high fibrosis stages, and usually 180 min
after food intake, value comes to the normal range;
therefore, it is recommended to measure hepatic
stiffness at least 4 h after food intake [89]. By using
cut-off values of 7.10 kPa and 9.1 kPa to detect, F ≥
2 and F ≥ 3 have sensitivity and specificity of 93.8%
and 52%, and 93.1% and 80.8% respectively[85].
When 13 kPa and 15.73 kPa are used to detect F4 fi￾brosis, the sensitivity and specificity are 75.3 and
87.8, and 100% and 82 % respectively [90, 91].
D. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE): It can
assess a larger surface area of the liver or the entire
liver than US-based modalities and is not limited by
ascites and obesity. MRE has a sensitivity of 94%
and specificity of 95% to differentiate F0 to F1 from
F2 to F4, and 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity in
differentiating F0 to F3 from F4 [92]. A cutoff value
of > 3.63 kPa has a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of
91%, NPV of 97%, and PPV of 68% to discriminate
advanced fibrosis (F3–F4) from stage F0 to F2
fibrosis [93]. Limitations of MRE are as follows: (1)
it cannot be applied to individuals with hepatic iron
overload due to the interfering signal intensity, (2)
high cost of MRE, (3) needs further validations.
Emerging genetic biomarkers for diagnosis of
different stages of NAFLD
Several genetic biomarkers were studied to diagnose or
identify different stages of NAFLD. However, it needs
further research before recommendations on emerging
genetic biomarkers.
A. Lipidomic serum tests: These tests distinguish
NAFLD from normal liver (NL) and NASH from
non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) with high accuracy.
The diagnostic performances of the validated tests
for discrimination between NAFLD and NL show
sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.57, respect￾ively and sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.81,
respectively for the discrimination between NASH
and NAFL [94]
B. Proteomic analysis: This analysis can be used to
differentiate simple steatosis from NASH with
significant fibrosis (F3/F4 group), and the NASH
with significant fibrosis (F3/F4 group) and without
significant fibrosis [95]. Complement component
C7 was three-fold higher in the NASH group with
significant/advanced fibrosis (F2–F4) compared
with the early NASH (F0–F1). Complement compo￾nent C7 and Fibulin-1 are positively correlated with
liver stiffness, whereas complement component C8
γ chain is negatively correlated. High levels of com￾plement C7 are associated with NASH with signifi￾cant/advanced fibrosis [96].
C. Gut microbiome-based metagenomic signature: Gut
microbiome compositions using whole-genome
shotgun sequencing of DNA extracted from stool
can be used to identify advanced hepatic fibrosis in
NAFLD patients. The gut microbiomes in NAFLD
are dominated by members of Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes followed by Actinobacteria and Proteo￾bacteria in much lower amount. Proteobacteria
phylum has a statistically significant increase in
amount (while the Firmicutes phylum decrease) as
the disease progresses from mild/moderate NAFLD
to advanced fibrosis [97].
Management of NAFLD (Fig. 4)
NALFD patients without NASH and hepatic fibrosis
are treated by lifestyle changes which include diet
modification and moderate physical exercise along
with treatment of underlying causes. Pharmacotherapy
is available in presence of NASH and fibrosis (≥ 2).
NAFLD patients with an advanced liver fibrosis (ELF
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 11 of 18

test > 10.51) a indication for pharmacotherapy in the
NICE guideline [98]. Patients with NASH should be
the main target of treatment due to higher risk of
mortality related to the disease. A weight loss of at
least 7% is required for histological improvement in
obese NASH patients.
A. Lifestyle modification: It is an effective therapy to
downgrade hepatic injury in NAFLD patients [99].
Diet modification: Energy restriction with a low calorie,
low fat, and low carbohydrate or high-protein
Fig. 4 Medical management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 12 of 18

Mediterranean diet is advised in NAFLD patients. 500–
1000 kcal deficit diet per day to induce a weight loss of
500–1000 g/week is usually recommended (according
to EASL, Asia-Pacific and AASLD guidelines). Accord￾ing to the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver
(IASL), amount of fat and carbohydrate should be <
30% and < 50% of total calories respectively.
Coffee drinking is protective in NAFLD by reducing
histological severity and liver-related outcomes and in￾versely related to the steatohepatitis severity [100].
Therefore daily coffee consumption should be encour￾aged in NAFLD patients. Coffee intake ≥ 2 cups/day im￾proves NAFLD and reduces liver-related morbidities
[101]. Caffeine inhibits proliferation of hepatic stellate
cell, thus exerting an anti-fibrogenic effect via adenosine
receptor blockade [102].
Fructose-containing beverages and foods should be
avoided because it appears as one major factor for initi￾ation of hepatic steatosis and also its progression to NASH
and more severe stages of the liver fibrosis [103, 104].
Alcohol intake should be < 30 g/day for men and < 20 g/
day for women but better to avoid alcohol consumption
of any type or amount in individuals with NAFLD [105].
Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces hepatic
steatosis and improves serum gamma-glutamyltransferase,
triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein in patients with
NAFLD; therefore, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
may be a new treatment option for NAFLD [106, 107].
But according to AASLD guideline (2018), omega-3 fatty
acid should not be used as a specific treatment of NAFLD
or NASH, but it can be used to treat hypertriglyceridemia
in NAFLD patients [5].
Physical exercise: Both moderate and vigorous aerobic
exercise (e.g., brisk walking, stationery cycling) and resist￾ance training (150–200 min/week in 3–5 sessions) is effect￾ive to reduce hepatic steatosis by reducing weight , and
choice of exercise should be based on patients’ preference
[108]. In general, 5 to 10% reduction in body weight in
obese or overweight people over 6 to 12 months has been
advocated through diet modification and physical exercise.
At least 3–5% of body weight loss is necessary to im￾prove hepatic steatosis, but > 7% weight loss is required
for histological improvement in NASH and fibrosis [5].
Therefore, the first line intervention in the manage￾ment of NAFLD is lifestyle modification which includes
(1) at least 7–10% weight loss by a combination of low￾calorie diet with discourage of high fructose and satu￾rated fat in foods. Diet with omega-3 fatty acid supple￾ment may be advised, and (2) moderate to vigorous
physical activity.
B. Pharmacotherapy: Only few drugs are
recommended in the treatment of biopsy-proven
NASH and fibrosis stage ≥ 2 or Fibroscan value >
10.51.
Pioglitazone: It is a peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist which improves histo￾logical features in biopsy-proven NASH patients with
and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fifteen to thirty
milligrams daily dose of Pioglitazone is recommended
in the above indication. The optimal duration of ther￾apy is unknown, but according to EASL guideline
[107], treatment should be stopped if there is no reduc￾tion in aminotransferases after 6 months of therapy,
and in patients with normal ALT at baseline, no recom￾mendations can be made. Bone loss in women and
weight gain are common side effect associated with use
of Pioglitazone. Bladder cancer has been a concern dur￾ing use of Pioglitazone, but another study found that
there is no statistically significant association between
use of Pioglitazone and risk of bladder cancer [109].
Vitamin E: It is superior to placebo for the treatment of
NASH in adults without diabetes, and compared with
placebo, vitamin E use is associated with significantly
higher rate of improvement in non-alcoholic steatohe￾patitis (43% vs. 19%). It reduces hepatic steatosis and
lobular inflammation, but no improvement in hepatic
fibrosis scores [110]. According to AASLD and NICE
guidelines, vitamin E may be considered at a dose of
800 IU/day in nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven
NASH [5]. But according to Asia-Pacific guideline, vita￾min E therapy is not beneficial for NASH management
[111].
Saroglitazar: Saroglitazar (dual PPAR α/γ agonist) at a
dose of 4 mg improves ALT value and fatty liver
(evaluated by transient elastography) in patients with
NALFD and diabetic dyslipidemia [112]. Saroglitazar
can be a potential therapeutic option for the
management of metabolic syndrome associated NAFLD
and NASH [113]. Another study from India with 12
months follow-up showed that Saroglitazar is safe and
effective in management of NAFLD patients and is a
potential option in the future [114]. But it needs further
exploration before recommendation.
Liraglutide: It is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ana￾log which is safe, well tolerated, and associated with
histological improvement of non-alcoholic steatohepati￾tis with 1.8 mg subcutaneous injections daily [115].
Most common side effects are diarrhea, constipation,
and loss of appetite. However, it needs large studies for
further evaluation for recommendation for the treat￾ment of NAFLD.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA): Histological activities of
NASH are not improved by using UDCA (13–15 mg/
kg/day) alone, but improvements are seen when
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 13 of 18

combination of vitamin E and UDCA is given [116].
High-dose UDCA (23–28 mg/kg/day) also fails to im￾prove the overall histology in patients with NASH
[117]. According to NICE, EASL, Asia-pacific, and
AASLD guidelines, UDCA is not recommended for
treatment of NAFLD, NASH, or hepatic fibrosis how￾ever few recent articles showed positive results [118,
119]. Parikh et al. in their study indicated that UDCA
is an effective and safe alternative to vitamin E in non￾diabetic–non-cirrhotic Indian NAFLD patients [118].
Another systemic review recommended UDCA as a
frontline therapeutic option for NASH, thereby pre￾venting its progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer
[119].
Obeticholic acid: This synthetic farnesoid X receptor
agonist at a dose of 25 mg daily is associated with
histological improvement of NASH [120, 121].
Obeticholic acid might become the first approved
pharmacotherapy for NASH fibrosis after result of
recent multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled
phase 3 trial done by Younossi et al. [122]. For long￾term safety and tolerability, it requires further studies,
as obeticholic acid can increase low density lipoprotein
level and pruritus is also extremely common with high
dose of obeticholic acid.
Statin and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: There are
no data to support their use specifically for NASH.
SGLT-2 inhibitors: These drugs improve the serum
liver enzymes value and reduce hepatic steatosis and
fibrosis in type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD [123].
Therefore use of SGLT2-inhibitors in type 2 diabetes
patients with NAFLD is promising. Further researches
are required to progress in this evolving field.
Others emerging drugs for management of NAFLD:
Elafibranor: It is a peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-α and peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-δ agonist and improves insulin sensitivity, glu￾cose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism, and reduces in￾flammation. Ratziu et al. in their study showed that
elafibranor (120 mg/day for 1 year) resolved NASH
without fibrosis worsening [124]. It has an effect on the
resolution on NASH and improvises two key drivers of
NASH progression—insulin resistance and serum lipid
normalization [125]. It induces nuclear factor-κB re￾sults in inhibition of inflammatory genes and decreases
the expression of acute-phase response genes [126]. It
causes reversible elevation of serum creatinine level;
therefore, its use is potentially limiting in patients with
concurrent renal disease. Common side effects are con￾gestive heart failure, peripheral edema, bone fractures,
and weight gain.
Lanifibranor (IVA337): It is a pan-peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist with
moderate and well-balanced activity on the three PPAR
isoforms (α, γ, δ). It inhibits proliferation and activation
of hepatic stellate cells which are the key cells driving
liver fibrogenesis in NASH. It improves liver histology
by decreasing liver steatosis, inflammation, and balloon￾ing. Wettstein et al. in their study indicated that lanifi￾branor has therapeutic potential in the treatment of
NASH [127].
Solithromycin: Solithromycin is a highly potent
macrolide antibiotic. A clinical trial is going on
(NCT02510599) which showed that there is reduction
of NAFLD activity score and ALT level after 90 days
treatment with Solithromycin in patients with NASH
by targeting intestinal microbiomes and metabolic
endotoxemia.
Cenicrivoric: Cenicriviroc is a CCR (C—C chemokine
receptor) 2 and CCR5 dual antagonist which is playing
an important role in macrophage recruitment and
polarization in NASH pathogenesis. One phase 2 trial
(2018) showed that there was improvement in fibrosis
and no worsening of steatohepatitis compared with
placebo [128]. Therefore, the drug is now in phase 3.
Selonsertib: It is an apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
(ASK1, involved in response to various stresses) inhibi￾tor. Loomba et al. in their phase 2 trial described that
selonsertib may reduce liver fibrosis in patients with
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and stage 2–3 fibrosis
[129]. Now this drug is in phase 3 trial.
Emricasan: It is an oral pan-caspase inhibitor. Lipotoxi￾city leading to excessive caspase-mediated apoptosis
and inflammation is responsible of liver damage in
NAFLD. Shiffman et al. in their study showed that
emricasan (25 mg twice daily) decreases ALT and bio￾markers in NAFLD patients after 28 days of treatment
[130].
C. Management of underlying diseases: Along with
above treatment, underlying causes of NAFLD
should be treated adequately like management of
each component of metabolic syndrome if present.
Conclusion
Though liver biopsy is the gold standard test to detect
NAFLD and to identify different stages of hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis, multiple non-invasive tests are also avail￾able nowadays. Few of them are FDA approved and
others’ diagnostic tests need further evaluation before rec￾ommendation in clinical practice. The NAFLD fibrosis
score, transient elastography are recommended to assess
hepatic fibrosis and disease activity [5] however for diag￾nosis of NASH, liver biopsy is required due to lack of
Paul Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:37 Page 14 of 18

availability of serum cytokeratine 19 fragments test in clin￾ical practice. Further studies are required to find out cut￾off values and role of non-invasive markers and tests
for NAFLD before giving approval. Liver biopsy should be
considered in the following conditions: (1) when a com￾peting etiology of chronic liver disease cannot be excluded
just by non-invasive methods, (2) suspect of NAFLD-re￾lated advanced liver disease. Treatment of NAFLD can be
divided into lifestyle modification (including diet restric￾tion, low calorie diet intake, physical exercise leading to
weight loss), pharmacotherapy (restricted to NAFLD pa￾tients with NASH and fibrosis), and management of
underlying causes of NAFLD. Early diagnosis and proper
management are required to avoid longterm complica￾tions of NAFLD.
