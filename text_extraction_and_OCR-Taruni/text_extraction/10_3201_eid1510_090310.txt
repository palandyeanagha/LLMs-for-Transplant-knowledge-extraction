Patients receiving anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (anti–
TNF-α) therapy are at increased risk for tuberculosis and 
other granulomatous diseases, but little is known about ill￾ness caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in this 
setting. We reviewed the US Food and Drug Administration 
MedWatch database for reports of NTM disease in patients 
receiving anti–TNF-α therapy. Of 239 reports collected, 105 
(44%) met NTM disease criteria. Median age was 62 years; 
the majority of patients (66, 65%) were female, and most 
(73, 70%) had rheumatoid arthritis. NTM infections were as￾sociated with infliximab (n = 73), etanercept (n = 25), and 
adalimumab (n = 7); most patients were taking prednisone 
(n = 68, 65%) or methotrexate (n = 58, 55%) concurrently. 
Mycobacteria avium (n = 52, 50%) was most commonly im￾plicated, and 9 patients (9%) had died at the time their infec￾tions were reported. A high rate of extrapulmonary manifes￾tations (n = 46, 44%) was also reported. 
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a large, di￾verse group of environmental organisms ubiquitous 
in water and soil (1). They cause a variety of diseases in 
humans, notably severe, protracted lung disease in pa￾tients with underlying lung disorders. Conditions such as 
bronchiectasis, emphysema, previous tuberculosis (TB) or 
other lung infections, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and other chronic diseases with pulmonary manifestations 
can predispose a person to NTM pulmonary disease (2). In 
addition to lung infections, NTM cause skin and soft tissue 
infections, lymphadenitis (predominantly in young chil￾dren), and disseminated disease in HIV-infected patients 
or others with severely compromised immune systems. 
The immunologic mechanism and related dysfunction that 
predispose persons to NTM disease are largely unknown, 
although defects in interleukin-12 or interferon-γ produc￾tion are known to increase the risk for disseminated NTM 
disease in humans (3).
Although the epidemiology of NTM disease is not well 
described, the belief that these infections are increasing in 
prevalence, particularly among women, is widespread (2). 
Assessment of the epidemiology of these infections may be 
increasingly useful because newer forms of biologic, immu￾nosuppressive therapies have become widely used for treat￾ing patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and 
other autoimmune inflammatory conditions. Many of these 
conditions are associated with lung manifestations known to 
be associated with NTM pulmonary infections (2).
To date, TB and NTM infections and concurrent bio￾logic therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
have been reported. These therapies include infliximab 
(Remicade; Centocor, Malvern, PA, USA), etanercept (En￾brel; Immunex, Seattle, WA, USA), and adalimumab (Hu￾mira; Abbott Biotechnology, Abbott Park, IL, USA), which 
have been approved in the United States and elsewhere to 
treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and selected other 
autoimmune inflammatory diseases (4). Because TNF-α is 
integral to granuloma generation and maintenance (5,6), 
patients using these agents are at increased risk for granu￾lomatous infections, including activation of latent TB in￾fection (7,8).
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) post￾marketing surveillance system (MedWatch) (www.fda.

Nontuberculous Mycobacteria and Anti–TNF-α
occurred during TNF-α blockade found that mycobacteria 
disease was more common than other granulomatous dis￾eases; TB was reported 5–10× more frequently than NTM, 
dimorphic fungi, and other intracellular infections in this 
setting (7). (Although this program does not specifically 
target participation outside the United States, it also in￾cludes nondomestic case reports.) Subsequently, much at￾tention has been focused on prevention of TB in patients 
who are using anti–TNF-α agents. To date, little is known 
regarding the types and relative frequencies of NTM infec￾tions that occur in such patients.
We recently conducted a survey among infectious dis￾ease physicians within the Emerging Infections Network of 
the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). This 
survey suggested that cases of NTM disease associated 
with anti–TNF-α therapy occur twice as frequently as cases 
of TB associated with anti–TNF-α therapy in the United 
States (9). NTM infections are likely underreported to the 
FDA, relative to TB, for a variety of reasons (10). NTM dis￾ease is generally insidious, sometimes difficult to diagnose, 
and is not reportable to health authorities. Accordingly, we 
reviewed the MedWatch database for NTM reports through 
January 1, 2007, to evaluate whether these case reports met 
clinical case criteria, to describe their clinical spectrum and 
outcome, and to evaluate the relative reporting frequency 
of cases among the different anti–TNF-α agents now in 
widespread use.
Methods
At our request, FDA searched its MedWatch database 
for NTM cases reported among patients using adalimumab, 
infliximab, or etanercept through January 1, 2007. Using 
the search terms nontuberculous mycobacteria infections, 
atypical mycobacteria infections, and leprous infections, 
FDA compiled all domestic and foreign reports with key￾words matching at least 1 of these search terms. The reports 
were redacted to remove any identifying information and 
sent to us for review. Because we sought to review only 
cases involving environmental NTM, cases caused by My￾cobacterium leprae (leprosy) were excluded (n = 5). We 
reviewed all reports and extracted the following data: etio￾logic organism, anti–TNF-α drug, and concomitant immu￾nosuppressive drugs used at the time of infection diagnosis, 
clinical and radiographic data, death or hospitalization dur￾ing infection treatment, and time between beginning drug 
treatment and infection diagnosis.
To define pulmonary disease, we used the American 
Thoracic Society (ATS)/IDSA case definition in which pa￾tients must have >2 sputum samples with NTM (or a single 
isolate in the case of bronchoscopy specimens) coexistent 
with appropriate radiographic findings and symptoms (2). 
If cases met these criteria they were deemed confirmed. If 
not enough information was provided for the case defini￾tion to be considered, they were deemed probable or un￾known based on the consensus opinion of 3 physicians 
from the Division of Infectious Diseases at Oregon Health 
and Sciences University. For extrapulmonary disease, pa￾tients with NTM isolated from normally sterile sites were 
considered to have confirmed cases. Disease reports that 
included infection with M. tuberculosis or organisms other 
than mycobacteria were excluded.
Data Analysis
All data were entered into Epi Info version 3.4.3 (Cen￾ters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). 
Two-by-two comparisons among variables were made by 
using Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) and Fisher exact 
test p values. We did not attempt to calculate or compare 
NTM incidence rates among different anti–TNF-α products 
because the MedWatch database does not include drug ex￾posure denominator data.
Results
There were 239 reports of NTM infection in patients 
who were receiving anti–TNF-α therapy. Most reports were 
for patients receiving infliximab (n = 174, 75%), followed by 
etanercept (n = 41, 17%), and adalimumab (n = 19, 8%). One 
case was reported in 1999 (patient used etanercept); numbers 
of reported infections among those using each product in￾creased in 2001 and thereafter. Reported cases among those 
using each of the 3 drugs were highest in 2005 (Figure 1). 
Of these reports, only 76 (32%) met either ATS/IDSA pul￾monary disease criteria or our case definition for extrapul￾monary disease. An additional 29 (12%) cases were judged 
to be probable cases, but the reports did not contain enough 
clinical or radiographic information to determine whether 
patients met ATS/IDSA NTM disease criteria. In other in￾stances, the reports were either clearly not of cases of NTM 
disease (n = 27, 11%) or could not be determined (n = 95, 
40%) because of a lack of microbiologic data, unclear report￾ing, or duplicate reports (n = 12, 5%). Of the 244 reports, 76 
(31%) were from outside the United States (Europe, n = 40; 
Japan, n = 21; Canada, n = 4; Israel, n = 1; South Africa, n = 
1; not specified, n = 9). Of patients with confirmed and prob￾able cases (n = 105), a similar proportion (n = 35, 33%) were 
from outside the United States; most of these were from Eu￾rope (n = 15) or Japan (n = 12).
Of the 105 confirmed or probable cases, most were in 
women (n = 66, 65%), and the median age was 63 years 
(range 20–90 years). The anti–TNF-α agents reported for 
these patients included infliximab (n = 73, 69%), etaner￾cept (n = 25, 24%), and adalimumab (n = 7, 7%). M. avium
was the most common etiologic organism reported (n = 52, 
49%), followed by rapidly growing mycobacteria (n = 20, 
19%), and M. marinum (n = 8, 8%) (Figure 2). Nine pa￾tients (9%) had died by the time their case was reported,

and 64 (61%) had NTM adverse events that resulted in 
hospitalization. The most common underlying medical in￾dication for anti–TNF-α therapy was rheumatoid arthritis 
(n = 73, 75%), followed by other inflammatory diseases 
(Table 1). Sixty-eight (65%) patients received concomi￾tant prednisone, and 58 (55%) received methotrexate at the 
time of their report. Twenty-five (24%) patients reportedly 
had >1 of the following conditions: bronchiectasis (n = 5, 
5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 11, 10%), 
diabetes mellitus (n = 5, 5%), and rheumatoid lung (n = 4, 
4%). Median time between anti–TNF-α agent start date and 
infection diagnosis was available for only 68 (65%) of the 
patients. For adalimumab (n = 5), the interval was 18 weeks 
(range 4–94 weeks), for etanercept (n = 22) it was 35 weeks 
(range 0–288 weeks), and for infliximab (n = 41) it was 43 
weeks (range 2–200 weeks).
The pulmonary region (n = 59, 56%) was the 
most frequently reported site of disease; the remain￾der of infections were extrapulmonary or disseminated 
(Table 2). Compared with patients with extrapulmonary 
NTM disease, patients with pulmonary NTM disease were 
more likely to have underlying rheumatoid arthritis (OR 
3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–8.8, p<0.01) and 
more likely to be infected with M. avium (OR 11.0, 95% CI 
4.4–27.9, p<0.01). Reported cases of pulmonary NTM dis￾ease were also more likely to be in female patients (OR 2.3, 
95% CI 1.0–5.3, p = 0.04) (Table 3). After we adjusted for 
differences in sex in a stratified analysis, rheumatoid arthri￾tis remained associated with pulmonary disease (adjusted 
OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4–8.3, p = 0.01). There were no sig￾nificant differences between the proportions of pulmonary 
disease, disseminated disease, death, or etiologic organ￾isms reported for patients who used infliximab and those 
who used etanercept. Overall, infliximab users were more 
likely to be using methotrexate (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2–8.0, 
p = 0.02) than were etanercept users (63% vs. 36%). Pred￾nisone use did not differ between the 2 groups; 50 (68%) 
of infliximab-treated patients and 14 (56%) of etanercept￾treated patients were using prednisone at the time of their 
report (p = 0.19).
For reported NTM adverse events that did not meet 
either ATS/IDSA case criteria or our probable case des￾ignation, similar analyses were performed. These persons 
were similar to persons with cases that met confirmed or 
probable case definitions. They did not differ with regard to 
sex, underlying medical condition, anti–TNF-α drugs used, 
mortality rate, or the ratio of pulmonary to extrapulmonary 
disease manifestations. However, these patients were less 
likely to be using concomitant prednisone (65% for patients 
with cases vs. 43% for patients without cases; OR 2.5, 95% 
CI 1.4–4.2, p<0.01) or concomitant methotrexate (55% for 
patients with cases vs. 37% for patients without cases; OR 
2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.6, p<0.01).
Discussion
We reviewed the FDA MedWatch database for reports 
of NTM infections in patients using anti–TNF-α therapies. 
We found several hundred reported events; most had oc￾curred in the 5 years since the previous review of this da￾tabase (7). Our study scrutinized clinical features of NTM 
infections reported in the database and characterized the

Nontuberculous Mycobacteria and Anti–TNF-α
microbiologic and clinical features of NTM disease in a sub￾stantial number of patients who were receiving anti–TNF-α 
therapy. Similar to patients with anti–TNF-α–associated TB, 
patients frequently had extrapulmonary disease and most re￾ported use of infliximab. M. avium was the most common 
etiologic agent reported; it was associated with pulmonary 
disease in elderly, female patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
To date, much of the available information regarding 
opportunistic infectious complications of anti–TNF-α ther￾apy in the United States has been derived from the passive 
MedWatch surveillance system, a voluntary system subject 
to underreporting. The number of NTM reports associ￾ated with anti–TNF-α therapy has increased substantially 
in this database since publication of the initial MedWatch 
analysis by Wallis et al (7), in which the authors reviewed 
cases reported through September 2002 and before FDA 
approval of adalimumab (etanercept and infliximab gained 
FDA approval in the fall of 1998, and adalimumab gained 
approval at the end of 2002). Unlike that review, we ex￾amined clinical details of the cases in these reports to as￾certain whether such patients actually met disease criteria. 
Because the respiratory tract is a nonsterile body site, pul￾monary specimens can yield environmental organisms such 
as NTM in healthy persons. Accordingly, ATS and IDSA 
collaboratively published clinical criteria that must be met 
to determine whether a patient with pulmonary NTM iso￾lates actually has NTM disease (2). Although we were able 
to apply this definition in some instances, our experience 
highlighted one of the limitations of the FDA MedWatch 
database: frequently a paucity of pertinent clinical details 
were reported. Accordingly, we found a high percentage of 
cases in MedWatch reports that did not meet disease crite￾ria either because information was not reported or because 
some patients simply did not have reported pathologic con￾ditions or other clinical criteria consistent with disease.
In our review, most patients with anti–TNF-α–related 
NTM were elderly women with rheumatoid arthritis. This 
finding is probably explained by several factors. First, rheu￾matoid arthritis is the most prevalent autoimmune inflamma￾tory diseases for which anti–TNF-α therapies are approved 
(4). Approximately 0.5%–1.0% of the US population has 
rheumatoid arthritis (11), and >40% of rheumatoid arthritis 
patients have been treated with these therapies (12). Second, 
rheumatoid lung disease, which can include bronchiolitis and 
bronchiectasis, develops in ≈10% of these patients. These 
and other lung disorders are known to increase the risk for 
NTM disease. Third, the age and sex distribution of patients 
in this report mirrors that for patients with pulmonary NTM 
disease and rheumatoid arthritis independent of anti–TNF-α 
therapy. NTM disease and rheumatoid arthritis are more 
common in women >50 years of age (2,11). Fourth, a high 
percentage of patients who receive anti–TNF-α therapy are 
known to have serious medical conditions, some of which 
might increase the risk for NTM disease (13). In our series, 
>15% of patients were reported to have chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis, which are known risk 
factors for pulmonary NTM disease.
Nearly half the patients in our series had extrapulmo￾nary disease. In patients with TB, TNF inhibition is known 
to increase the risk for extrapulmonary and disseminated 
disease manifestations (14,15). Similar proportions of such 
disease were reported in our series of NTM patients. Simi￾lar to reports of TB, reports of NTM disease in the database 
were more numerous for persons who used infliximab. We 
were not able to access treatment start data for each of these 
agents because such information is proprietary, although 
etanercept and infliximab have been used more extensively 
than the more recently approved adalimumab (4).
Although no study has directly compared the risk for 
NTM disease between users of infliximab and users of other 
anti–TNF-α agents, use of infliximab may pose greater risk 
for NTM disease. If true, the risk could be caused by the 
drug itself or differences in the characteristics of patients 
given infliximab relative to users of the other anti–TNF-α 
compounds (4,7,8). For example, in our current series, in￾fliximab users were more likely to be concomitantly using 
methotrexate at the time of diagnosis. The FDA database 
is limited because physician case reports are voluntary and

no denominator data with regard to drug exposure are col￾lected. For these reasons, we did not attempt to calculate or 
compare rates of NTM disease among various anti–TNF-α 
agents or among reporting years of this study. Thus, firm 
conclusions cannot be made regarding the comparative risk 
for use of these agents.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the British Thoracic Society, and others have published 
recommendations describing the role of latent TB screening 
and treatment before use of anti–TNF-α therapy (16–19). 
Although screening can decrease the risk for TB in such 
patients (20), with the incumbent risk of illness and disease 
transmission, it is less clear what should be done to prevent 
NTM disease occurrence or progression in patients who use 
these compounds. Given the long median periods between 
the start of drug use and disease diagnosis within this case 
series, for many of these patients, NTM disease likely had 
been newly acquired during anti–TNF-α therapy.
Alternately, given the slow progression and insidious 
nature of pulmonary NTM disease, some of the patients in 
this series likely had existing but undiagnosed pulmonary 
NTM disease before starting their anti–TNF-α therapy. 
This likelihood raises the question whether patients should 
be screened for NTM disease before initiating anti–TNF-α 
therapy. According to published guidelines, all patients in 
the United States should be screened for latent TB infec￾tion before receiving therapy, a screening that includes a 
chest radiograph. Although abnormalities on such a radio￾graph could trigger sputum evaluation for TB and NTM, 
a chest radiograph is not sufficiently sensitive for detect￾ing bronchiectasis or other lung abnormalities associated 
with NTM disease. If not previously obtained, clinicians 
could consider obtaining a noncontrast chest computed to￾mography scan before administering therapy to any patient 
with a history of bronchiectasis or other architectural lung 
disease, chronic unexplained cough, or abnormalities noted 
on their screening chest radiograph suggestive of NTM 
disease (e.g., reticulonodular infiltrate). If chest computed 
tomography suggests possible NTM disease, further pul￾monary testing with sputum or other samples obtained by 
bronchoscopy would be indicated to rule out active NTM 
disease before initiating anti–TNF-α therapy (21).
Because most physicians would be reluctant to prescribe 
anti–TNF-α therapy to patients with known or obvious ac￾tive infections, we suspect that most extrapulmonary infec￾tions (primarily soft tissue infections) in our series likely 
developed in patients after they began anti–TNF-α therapy. 
It is not clear what risk factors predisposed patients to these 
infections in our series and unlikely that such complications 
during therapy can be screened for or prevented.
There are increasing numbers of case reports of pul￾monary NTM disease for patients using anti–TNF-α ther￾apy (9,22,23). In some of these patients, pulmonary NTM 
disease progressed while they were receiving anti–TNF-α 
therapy, despite aggressive antimycobacterial treatment. 
Most patients in our series were hospitalized for their in￾fections, and although <10% died by the time their case 
was reported, we suspect that follow-up beyond the time 
of the event report would indicate that a greater number of 
deaths occurred during therapy. Given the serious illnesses 
and deaths caused by these infections, whether anti–TNF-α 
therapy can be safely continued during antimycobacterial 
therapy is not clear. It is also not evident when it would be 
safe to reinstitute anti–TNF-α therapy in such patients.
We believe that our review of the FDA MedWatch da￾tabase suggests that NTM represents a serious and severe 
granulomatous complication that can occur during anti–
TNF-α therapy. However, lack of denominators for persons 
treated with these drugs precludes calculation of rates, and 
without a control group, it is not possible to definitively 
conclude that anti–TNF-α therapy causes or is associated 
with NTM disease. This finding is further complicated by 
potential confounders such as other immunosuppressive 
therapy and predisposing conditions among the popula￾tion being studied. For example, epidemiologic features 
of patients who use anti–TNF-α drugs are similar to those 
who are at risk for NTM pulmonary disease in the absence 
of these drugs (i.e., elderly women, many of whom who 
have underlying lung disease). Nevertheless, our findings 
are useful because to date, the possibility of NTM disease 
has been underreported for patients who use anti–TNF-α 
therapies. Our findings highlight that these cases are oc￾curring in such patients, often with devastating outcomes. 
Future population-based studies are necessary to determine

should remain vigilant for these and other types of serious
