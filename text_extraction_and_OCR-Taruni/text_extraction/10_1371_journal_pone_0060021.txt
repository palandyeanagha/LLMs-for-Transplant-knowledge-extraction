Abstract
Therapeutic targeting of the beta-adrenergic receptors has recently shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of benign
vascular tumors such as infantile hemangiomas. As infantile hemangiomas are reported to express high levels of beta
adrenergic receptors, we examined the expression of these receptors on more aggressive vascular tumors such as
hemangioendotheliomas and angiosarcomas, revealing beta 1, 2, and 3 receptors were indeed present and therefore
aggressive vascular tumors may similarly show increased susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of beta blockade. Using a
panel of hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma cell lines, we demonstrate that beta adrenergic inhibition blocks cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Beta blockade is selective for vascular tumor cells over
normal endothelial cells and synergistically effective when combined with standard chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic agents.
We demonstrate that inhibition of beta adrenergic signaling induces large scale changes in the global gene expression
patterns of vascular tumors, including alterations in the expression of established cell cycle and apoptotic regulators. Using
in vivo tumor models we demonstrate that beta blockade shows remarkable efficacy as a single agent in reducing the
growth of angiosarcoma tumors. In summary, these experiments demonstrate the selective cytotoxicity and tumor
suppressive ability of beta adrenergic inhibition on malignant vascular tumors and have laid the groundwork for a
promising treatment of angiosarcomas in humans.

Introduction
A wealth of evidence indicates that stressful situations exacer￾bate tumor progression. Adrenergic processes stimulated by
epinephrine and norephinephrine drive the development of tumor
growth and metastasis [1,2,3]. Breast cancer models indicate the
sympathetic nervous system serves as a neural regulator inducing a
metastatic switch, with stress-induced neuroendocrine activation
leading to a 30-fold increase in tumor metastasis [4]. Moreover,
beta adrenergic receptor antagonists have shown efficacy against
melanoma [5,6], breast cancer [7,8,9,10,11,12], and prostate
cancer [3], and high beta adrenergic receptor expression in tumors
is associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients
[13]. One prospective study revealed a 36% reduction in the risk
of melanoma progression for each year of beta blocker treatment
[6].
The non-specific beta adrenergic receptor inhibitor propranolol
has been utilized as the gold standard treatment in pediatric
patients with infantile hemangioma, a benign vascular tumor
which affects up to 10% of the Caucasian population [14].
Infantile hemangiomas express high levels of beta adrenergic
receptors potentially explaining their sensitively to propranolol,
and these receptors are reported to be high in malignant vascular
tumors [15]. This suggests the efficacy of propranolol and other
beta blockers may extend to aggressive vascular tumors. Several
reports indicate positive results from beta blockade in patients with
moderately threatening vascular tumors including kaposiform
hemangioendothelioma, tufted angiomas, parotid hemangioma,
Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, and drug resistant hepatic
hemangiomas [16,17,18,19,20]. It remains to be determined if
more malignant vascular tumors such as the rare and understudied
metastatic hemangioendotheliomas and angiosarcomas are sus￾ceptible to the effects of beta blockade. Such a study is essential
given the five year survival rates for angiosarcomas and metastatic
hemangioendotheliomas are very poor. Treatment of angiosarco￾mas typically involves surgery, radiation, and neoadjuvant and/or
adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin or taxanes, yet even
following aggressive therapy, patient survival in metastatic disease
is abysmally low [21,22]. Hemangioendotheliomas are often
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60021

associated with low mitotic index and are typically more
manageable, however approximately 30% of these tumors display
aggressive behavior, rapid disease progression, and eventual
patient death despite extensive treatment [23,24]. Given the lack
of adequate therapies for angiosarcomas and aggressive heman￾gioendotheliomas, there exists a strong need for the development
of treatments against these unique tumor types. Based on the
remarkable efficacy of propranolol against benign vascular tumors
and the recent report that malignant vascular tumors exhibit high
beta adrenergic receptor expression we hypothesized that heman￾gioendotheliomas and angiosarcomas should be particularly
susceptible to propranolol. Thus we examined the effects of
propranolol on the oncogenic properties of a panel of malignant
vascular tumor lines and the growth of in vivo angiosarcoma
tumors. Our data lay the preclinical groundwork for the future
clinical use of beta blockade against malignant vascular tumors in
humans.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Use of de-identified human tissues was approved by the Texas
Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Review
Board for the Protection of Human Subjects (IRB E13029).
Waiver of informed consent was approved by IRB under 35 CFR
46.117(c)(1). All mouse experimentation was approved by the
Texas Tech University IACUC committee (IACUC #12020) and
conducted according to responsible guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals. Animals were sacrificed using CO2
asphyxiation.
Cell Culture and Reagents
The mouse SVR angiosarcoma line (ATCC #CRL-2280) and
EOMA hemangioendothelioma line (ATCC #CRL-2586) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin
(P/S). The canine angiosarcoma lines Emma, Frog, and SB were
cultured as previously reported [25]. Primary cultures of human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVECs, ATCC
#CRL-4025) were grown in vascular cell basal media (ATCC
#PCS-100-030) and supplemented with 0.2% bovine brain
extract, 5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 10 mM L￾glutamine, 0.75 units/ml heparin sulfate, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone,
50 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 2% fetal bovine serum, and pen/strep.
Propranolol was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide for all in vitro
experiments or isotonic saline for all in vivo experiments. Cytotoxic
agents were used at the following concentrations: cisplatin
(10 mM), busulfan (80 mM), vincristine (1 mM), and H2O2
(1:5000 dilution of 3% stock).
mRNA Expression
For qPCR, RNA from 100 mM propranolol or sham treated
SVR cells (24 hours treatment) was purified using the Purelink
RNA mini kit (Ambion) and converted to cDNA using the Verso
cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo-Scientific). qPCR was performed in
triplicate using TaqMan probes for ADRB1 (Invitrogen; human/
mouse #Hs02330048_s1, canine #Cf02691262_g1), ADRB2
(Invitrogen; human/mouse #Hs00240532_s1, canine
#Cf02690130_s1), and ADRB3 (Invitrogen; human/mouse
#Hs00609046_m1, canine #Cf03022965_s1) or qPCR arrays
(SABiosciences; apoptosis array #PAMM-012Z, cell cycle array
#PAMM-020Z) on an ABI7900HT real time PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems). Microarrays on SVR cells treated for 24
hours with 100 mM propranolol or sham were performed in
triplicate from pooled samples of three biological replicates for
each condition as previously reported [26]. Briefly, total RNA was
isolated from each replicate using the Purelink RNA Micro kit
(Invitrogen), pooled, and amplified and biotin-labeled using
Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). 750 ng of
biotinylated aRNA was then briefly heat-denatured and loaded
onto expression arrays to hybridize overnight. Following hybrid￾ization, arrays were labeled with Cy3-streptavidin and imaged
using the Illumina ISCAN. Intensity values were transferred to
Agilent GeneSpring GX microarray analysis software and data
was filtered based on the quality of each call. Statistical relevance
was determined using ANOVA with a Benjamini Hochberg FDR
multiple testing correction (p-value ,0.05). Data were then limited
by fold change analysis to statistically relevant data points
demonstrating a 2-fold or greater change in expression. Omics
pathway analysis was performed with Metacore integrated
software suite (GeneGo). Microarray data was publically deposited
in Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession # GSE42534).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on 5 mm thick,
formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded angiosarcoma sections obtained
from Hospital Ste Jutine (Montreal, Canada). Sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated for antigen retrieval using
Trilogy (Cell Marque; Cat. No. 920P-10). To block nonspecific
binding, sections were incubated in Background Block solution
(Cell Marque; Cat. No. 927B-05) at room temperature for 10
minutes before application of the primary antibody. The following
primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-ADBR1 (1:200,
Abbiotec Cat. No. 250919), rabbit anti-ADBR2 (1:200, Abbiotec
Cat. No. 251604), and rabbit anti-ADBR3 (1:200, Abbiotec Cat.
No.251434). Sections were then washed in PBS IHC Wash Buffer
with tween 20 (Cell Marque; Cat. No. 934B-09) three times for 5
minutes each and then incubated with the CytoScan Alkaline Phos
Detection System (Cell Marque; Cat. No. 952D-20). The immu￾nostaining was carried out using Permanent Red Chromogen
detection kit (Cell Marque; Cat. No. 960D-20) and counterstained
with Hematoxylin.
Cell Proliferation/survival
Cells were plated at approximately 50% confluence and treated
with a dose curve of 0 to 200 mM propranolol over a 48 hour time
course. Time lapse microscopy was performed using a BioStation
CT (Nikon) and the change in cell number over the experimental
time course was determined by manually counting cells per vision
field. For growth in three dimensional culture to examine the
effects of chronic low doses of propranolol on vascular tumor cell
survival, cells were seeded onto Alvetex membranes at 26105 cells
per (12) well, allowed to establish for 48 hours, and subsequently
treated with a sub-lethal concentration of propranolol (20 mM) or
sham over a period of 6 days, after which the membranes were
stained with Hoechst 33342 to label the nuclei to facilitate cell
counting. Numerical data presented for all proliferation experi￾ments is the average of at least three biological replicates +/2 the
standard deviation. Statistical significance was determined using
Student’s t-test (P,0.05).
Immunofluorescence
Cells/tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabi￾lized in 0.01% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% milk plus 0.05%
Tween-20, and incubated with antibodies against either p21 (1:50,
Abcam #ab7960), p27 (1:200, Cell Signaling #3698), cleaved
caspase 3 (1:100, Cell Signaling #9664), or proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (1:2500, Cell Signaling #2586). For actin

cytoskeletal detection, cells were incubated with rhodamine￾labelled phalloidin (1:150, Cytoskeleton Inc.). The primary
antibodies were then detected with Alexa Fluor secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst
33342 and imaged on a Nikon C2SI laser scanning confocal
microscope. For immunoflourescent detection of the apoptotic
index, cells were stained for 10 minutes with 5 mg/ml Hoechst
33342 and 5 mg/ml propidium iodide, and washed 36 in
phosphate buffered saline. Images of nuclei from cells treated
with 100 mM propranolol for 24 hrs were equivalently processed
in Nikon Elements 3.2, surface rendering images were obtained
using Imaris 6.0, and 3D deconvolution was performed using
Autoquant X3.
Western Blotting
Cell lysates were collected after 1 or 24 hours treatment (as
indicated in the results), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer
System (Biorad). Membranes were incubated with antibodies
obtained from Cell Signaling [phospho-p38 (1:1000, #4511), p38
(1:1000, #8690), Cdk4 (1:1000, #2906), Cdk6 (1:1000, #3136),
CycD1 (1:500, #2978), CycE (1:5000, #4129), PCNA (1:2500,
#2586) ‘‘p27 (1:1000, #3698)’’ p53 (1:1000, #2527), cleaved
caspase-3 (1:200, #9664), cleaved PARP (1:200, #9544), p-cofilin
(1:1000, #3313), p-ERM (1:1000, #3142), p-MYPT (1:1000,
#3040), or b-actin antibodies (1:1000, #4970)] or Abcam [p21
(1:100, #ab7960) p-Tie2 (1:1000, #ab788142), Tie2 (1:1000,
#ab24859)] followed with 1:1000 HRP-conjugated secondary.
Proteins were detected using Supersignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and digitally captured
using a GE Image Quant LAS4000 imaging system.
Cell Cycle Analysis
Cells treated for 24 hours with 50 mM propranolol were
trypsinized, fixed in a 70:30 ratio of ethanol:phosphate buffered
saline overnight, stained with 200 mg/ml ethidium bromide plus
20 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated overnight. DNA content of
each cell treatment condition was analyzed using an Accuri C6
flow cytometer. Quantitative analysis of DNA content was
performed using CFlow Plus software (Accuri). Quantification of
the percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase represents the
average of at least three biological replicates +/2 the standard
deviation. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t￾test (P,0.05).
Coculture Assays
Primary cultures of human dermal microvascular endothelial
cells (HDMVECs, ATCC #CRL-4025) were labeled with Cell
Tracker Blue (Invitrogen) and mixed with unlabeled SVR
angiosarcoma cells. The coculture was grown in vascular cell
basal media (ATCC #PCS-100-030) and supplemented with
0.2% bovine brain extract, 5 ng/ml human epidermal growth
factor, 10 mM L-glutamine, 0.75 units/ml heparin sulfate, 1 mg/
ml hydrocortisone, 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 2% fetal bovine
serum, and pen/strep. Cells were treated 48 hours with 100 mM
propranolol or sham and Cell Tracker Blue fluorescence (marking
the HDMVECs) and phase contrast (visualizing both HDMVECs
and SVR cells) were imaged using a Floid Cell Imaging Station
(Life Technologies).
Migration Assay
For scratch assays, confluent cultures of vascular tumor cells
were manually scratch wounded with a P-200 micropipette tip,
treated with 50 mM propranolol, and wound closure was
monitored hourly using a Nikon Biostation CT time lapse imaging
robot over an 18 hour period. For the spheroid migration assay,
2000 cells from the Frog and Emma cell lines were cultured in a
hanging drop of their growth media (30 ml total volume) for 24
hours and then allowed to adhere to a standard tissue culture
substrate in the presence of 50 mM propranolol or sham. Images
were obtained 24 hours after attachment using a Nikon TS100
inverted microscope. Data presented for migration experiments is
the average of at least three biological replicates +/2 the standard
deviation. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t￾test (P,0.05).
Computational Cytoskeleton Analysis
Median stress fiber length was calculated using the FiberScore
algorithm [27] for actin cytoskeleton immunofluoresence images
from propranolol or sham treated malignant vascular tumor cells
(obtained as described in Immunofluorescence methods described
above). At least 10 images of each condition were used for the
analysis.
In vivo Tumor Assays
SVR chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) tumors were grown
using the gelatin sponge-chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay
as previously described [28]. An isotonic saline sham (N = 4 eggs)
or 100 mM propranolol (N = 3 eggs) was added daily directly onto
the tumors every two days, and tumors were collected 6 days post
implantation. Mouse angiosarcoma tumors were generated by
subcutaneous injection of 16106 SVR cells into the dorsolateral
flank of 4 week old female mice as previously described [29]. Mice
were treated with sham (isotonic saline; N = 15) or propranolol
(10 mg/ml; N = 17) via intraperitoneal injections every 2 days.
When the sham tumors reached approximately 1 cm in diameter,
the tumors were collected. Numerical data presented for all tumor
experiments is the average of at least three biological replicates +/
2 the standard deviation (for the CAM assays) or the standard
error of the mean (for the mouse angiosarcoma tumor assays).
Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test
(P,0.05).
Results
Beta Adrenergic Receptors are Expressed in Malignant
Vascular Tumors
Beta adrenergic receptors 1, 2, and 3 have been shown to be
expressed across a diverse panel of vascular tumors, with the
highest expression in malignant vascular tumors [15]. To confirm
this, we performed immunohistochemistry for the steady state
protein levels of ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 on four clinically
characterized human angiosarcoma tumors, revealing strong
signals for ADRB1 and ADRB2 and weaker sample-dependent
signals for ADRB3 (Figure 1A). The clinical data from each
angiosarcoma tissue sample is detailed in Table 1. We then
examined the steady state mRNA expression levels of ADRB1,
ADRB2, and ADRB3 in a panel of malignant vascular tumor lines
including 4 primary canine angiosarcoma cell lines (Emma, Frog,
Jack, and SB), one mouse angiosarcoma cell line (SVR), and one
mouse hemangioendothelioma cell line (EOMA), demonstrating
that canine angiosarcoma lines preferentially express ADRB2 and
ADRB3 (Figure 1B), while malignant mouse vascular tumor lines
express ADRB1 and ADRB2 (Figure 1C). As infantile hemangi￾omas (which strongly express beta adrenergic receptors [15,26]),
are clinically susceptible to propranolol, we sought to determine if
malignant vascular tumors respond similarly.

Propranolol Inhibits Proliferation of Malignant Vascular
Tumor Cells in a Dose Dependent Manner
To test if propranolol inhibits the proliferation rates of
hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma cells, we subjected a
panel of canine angiosarcoma lines (Emma, SB, and Frog), the
mouse angiosarcoma line (SVR), and the mouse hemangioendo￾thelioma line (EOMA) to a dose curve of propranolol for 48 hours
and measured cell numbers via time lapse imaging. Propranolol
inhibits the proliferation of all malignant vascular tumor cell lines
tested in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2A & B). Even at the
lowest concentration of propranolol (25 mM), we observed a cell
type dependent 15% to 67% reduction in proliferation, with
EOMA hemangioendothelioma cells being the most sensitive and
SB angiosarcoma cells the least sensitive. At higher concentrations
(100 to 200 mM) significant (p,0.05) cell death occurred across all
tumor lines, with 100% lethality in all vascular tumor lines except
SB at 100 mM propranolol. Because acute treatment of monolayer
cultures fails to recapitulate the environment experienced by
tumor cells, we tested chronic low doses of propranolol on
malignant vascular tumor cells seeded onto 200 mm thick 3D
microcellular polymer membranes. The panel was treated with a
chronic low dose of propranolol (20 mM) or sham over a period of
6 days, after which the membranes were stained with Hoechst
33342 to label the nuclei to facilitate cell counting, revealing that
under chronic low-dose conditions, the cell panel exhibited a
statistically reduced proliferation rates compared to sham condi￾tions (Figure 2C & D). We then performed flow cytometric
analysis on propidium iodide stained vascular tumor cells which
were treated with sham or 50 mM propranolol for 24 hours. We
utilized 50 mM propranolol for this experiment since our initial
experiments at higher doses (100+ mM propranolol) resulted in a
large sub-apoptotic peak for each cell line (data not shown) thus
complicating analysis of how beta blockade affects cell cycle
progression. Due to the heterogeneous cell populations composing
the EOMA line and complicating interpretation of the data with
numerous peaks, we excluded this line from cell cycle analysis.
Both SVR and Emma cell lines exhibited a significant increase of
cells in the G2/M phase following propranolol addition, while
treatment of Frog led to an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase
(Figure 2E & F). The cell cycle profile of propranolol treated SB
cells was not significantly different from the sham SB cells,
corroborating its relative resistance to the treatment.
To identify mechanisms by which propranolol inhibits vascular
tumor cell proliferation, we performed a global gene expression
microarray on SVR angiosarcoma cells treated with sham or
100 mM propranolol for 24 hours. We identified 84 genes whose
expression was statistically altered by more than 3-fold (p,0.05) in
response to propranolol and 428 genes exhibiting a significant 2-
fold or greater expression alteration. The three fold or greater
changes are listed in Table 2 and the entire dataset can be
publically accessed via the Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession
# GSE42534). Genego pathway analysis identified five major
cellular processes that were altered in response to propranolol
including cell cycle, cell survival, cholesterol metabolism, immune
response, and cell movement. We followed up on the changes by
testing the expression of a number of genes/proteins involved in
cell cycle regulation using qPCR arrays on SVR cells treated for
24 hours with sham or 100 mM propranolol. Quantification of the
steady state mRNA expression levels of 84 genes known to be
involved in cell cycle regulation identified 25 genes whose
expression was significantly altered by more than 1.5 fold
(p,0.05) in response to propranolol (Figure 3A). Of particular
interest were the 4.7 and 4.4 fold upregulation of the potent cell
cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b, respectively. We validated this
data via Western and immunofluorescence analysis of Cdkn1a and
Cdkn1b (p21 and p27, respectively) in SVR angiosarcoma lines
treated for 24 hours with sham or 100 mM propranolol, revealing
significant upregulation of both proteins following propranolol
treatment (Figure 3B & C). Further experimentation revealed
decreased steady state protein levels for the proliferative marker
PCNA and the key cell cycle regulators Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin D1,
and cyclin E1 (Figure 3C). Our microarray analysis identified a
marked 3.2-fold upregulation in Tek expression following 24 hours
of propranolol (Table 2). This gene encodes for the Tie2 receptor
which is a major regulator of vessel maturation and may partly
explain the selectivity of propranolol for cells of endothelial origin.
24 hour treatment of SVR cells with 100 mM propranolol resulted
in a strong upregulation of Tie2 protein levels, and stimulation of
the Tie2 receptor with angiopoietin-1 in serum starved SVR cells
treated with either sham or 100 mM propranolol led to a
propranolol-dependent increase in Tie2 phosphorylation
(Figure 3D). These data suggest that propranolol may be
influencing the transcriptional regulation of signaling pathways
involved in vessel quiescence and maturation.
Propranolol Induces Apoptosis of Malignant Vascular
Tumor Cells
We observed significant cell death in the panel of malignant
vascular tumor cell lines at 100 mM propranolol or greater
(Figure 2A), thus we investigated the contribution of propranolol
to hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma cell survival. The
cell panel was treated with sham or 100 mM propranolol for 24
hours, co-incubated with membrane impermeable propidium
iodide (staining only dead cells) and membrane permeable
Hoechst 33342 (staining live and dead cells), and the percent
apoptosis was determined by quantifying the portion of propidium
iodide stained cells in the total population. Propranolol treatment
resulted in a significantly increased apoptosis in each cell line, with
no propidium iodide cells detected in any of the sham treatments
(Figure 4A & B). Nuclear modeling of Hoechst 33342 stained
SVR cells treated with 100 mM propranolol revealed nuclear
morphology alterations indicative of apoptosis (Figure 4C), and
given that pathway analysis of our microarray data revealed a
strong apoptotic node, we quantified the steady state mRNA
expression levels of 84 genes involved in apoptosis using SVR cells
treated for 24 hours with sham or 100 mM propranolol. We
identified 18 genes whose expression was significantly altered 1.5
fold or more (p,0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that beta blockade
regulates the network of genes controlling angiosarcoma cell
survival. Furthermore, staining for cleaved-caspase 3 was observed
in SVR angiosarcoma cells treated for 24 hours with 100 mM
propranolol, but undetectable in sham conditions (Figure 4E). 1
hour of propranolol treatment in SVR cells resulted in marked
increases in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Figure 4F),
suggesting that cells are rapidly responding by initiating the stress
response pathway. No changes in the phosphorylation of p42/44

or JNK/SAPK were detected following propranolol treatment
(data not shown). After 24 hours, Western analysis revealed that
100 mM propranolol treatment of SVR cells resulted in increased
p53, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP (Figure 4G), indicative
of an apoptotic response. Despite propranolol’s ability to induce
apoptosis at relatively higher concentrations, this effect must be
selective for tumor cells, yet spare normal cells. We previously
reported that primary cultures of human endothelial cells exhibit
reduced proliferation at 50 mM propranolol, however no apoptosis
was observed at propranolol concentrations less than 150 mM
[26]. To test if propranolol exhibits selectivity against malignant
vascular tumor cells, we performed co-culture experiments where
unstained SVR cells were grown in the presence of CellTracker
Blue dye stained human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMVECs). After 48 hours, sham treatment resulted in a
confluent layer of SVR cells intermixed with dispersed
HDMVECs cells (Figure 4H). In contrast, 100 mM propranolol
resulted in complete detachment of SVR cells, with only labeled
HDMVECs attached to the substrate.
Even following chemotherapy and radiation, patients with
angiosarcomas and metastatic hemangioendotheliomas experience
a high mortality rate. If beta blockade is ever used in a clinical
setting, it will likely be used in combination with standard anti￾angiosarcoma chemotherapeutics, thus we tested if propranolol is
effective as a combination therapeutic against malignant vascular
tumors. We treated the cell panel with sham, 100 mM propranolol,
chemotherapeutic/cytotoxic agents (cisplatin, busulfan, vincris￾tine, or H2O2 induced free radical damage) alone, or the
combination of propranolol and these agents. Either propranolol
or the toxic agents led to significant reductions in cell survival after
48 hours in all cell lines, however the combination of propranolol
plus the chemotherapeutic/cytotoxic agents resulted in synergistic
reductions in survival for all lines except Frog (Figure 5A). One
of the most common reasons for mortality in cancer patients is
acquisition of drug resistance following treatment, therefore we
tested if our cell panel is capable of developing resistance to
propranolol. The cells were treated with lethal doses (100 mM) of
propranolol for several days and the few surviving cells were
allowed to repopulate the culture. This process was repeated
multiple times. Cell survival was measured between naı¨ve cells (1st
treatment) and cells after four rounds of propranolol selection (4th
treatment). Cell survival was statistically no different between naı¨ve
cells and experienced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that resistance
to propranolol may be minimal. This data suggests that
propranolol may enhance the efficacy of standard therapies
without increasing tumor resistance.

Propranolol Disrupts the Migration of Malignant Vascular
Tumors
To test if propranolol affects malignant vascular tumor cell
migration, we performed scratch assays on our cell panel. To
avoid cell death from high doses of propranolol, we reduced the
concentration to 50 mM, for which no net negative decreases in
cell proliferation were observed for any line (Figure 2A). At this
dosage, we were able to accurately measure migration changes
without changes in cell death complicating the data analysis. For
all lines tested except SVR, 50 mM propranolol reduced closure of
the wound relative to the sham (Figure 6A). To corroborate these
findings, we employed a 3D growth assay where cells were
cultured as 3D spheres, plated onto a substrate in the presence of
50 mM propranolol or sham, and allowed to invade into the
adjacent surroundings over 24 hours. Similar to our reasoning
with scratch wounding migration assays, we used a sublethal dose
of propranolol (50 mM) to evaluate migration independent of cell
death. Only Emma and Frog assembled into well formed tumor
spheroids, thus we proceeded with using these lines. The sham
treated tumor spheroids aggressively migrated from the spheroid
mass into surrounding areas over the 24 hour period, while 50 mM
propranolol abolished all migration (Figure 6B). To understand
the mechanism by which propranolol inhibits cell movement and
invasion, we first tested the phosphorylation status of key
cytoskeletal regulators in SVR angiosarcoma cells. We have
previously shown that propranolol treatment of infantile heman￾gioma endothelial cells decreased phosphorylation of the actin
regulatory protein cofilin [26], however Western blot analysis of
SVR cells showed no change in the phosphorylation of cofilin,
ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM), or myosin phosphatase targeting
subunit (MYPT) in reponse to propranolol (Figure 6C). Imaging
of actin microfilaments revealed that sham SVR cells exhibited

angiosarcoma cells were co-cultured with CellTracker Blue stained HDMVECs. The co-cultures were subjected to sham or 100 mM propranolol and

least three biological replicates. Statistical significant was determined using Students t-test (p,0.05).

well developed actin stress fibers and numerous lamellipodia, while
sublethal doses of propranolol (50 mM) resulted in dissolution of
central actin stress fibers, with only cortical actin remaining along
the cell periphery (Figure 6D). We measured the median stress
fiber length of sham or 50 mM propranolol treated malignant
vascular tumor cells using the FiberScore algorithm [27], revealing
a significantly marked reduction in stress fiber length following
propranolol treatment in all but the Emma and EOMA lines
(Figure 6E).
Propranolol Inhibits Angiosarcoma Tumor Growth
To move our findings into more relevant in vivo models, we
employed the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) tumor assay
where SVR cells in a gelatin sponge were placed onto the
vascularized CAM of 8 day post-fertilization chicken eggs. Tumors
were treated with a sham or 100 mM propranolol every two days
over a six day time course, after which the tumors were excised,
revealing significant reductions in tumor size and weight in
propranolol treated tumors (Figure 7A & B). We expanded our
studies into an established mouse angiosarcoma tumor model [29]
where the animals were systemically treated with saline sham or
10 mg/kg propranolol every 2 days. Tumor collection occurred
when the sham tumors reached approximately 1 cm3
. Propranolol
therapy resulted in significantly reduced angiosarcoma tumor size
and weight (357+/258 mg; N = 17, p,0.0001) vs sham (984+/
292 mg; N = 15, p,0.0001) (Figure 7C & D). Despite the
reduction in tumor size following propranolol administration,
tumor sections from both sham and propranolol conditions
revealed PCNA expression at the tumor peripheries, indicating
active cell division (Figure 7E). This suggests that future studies
should employ combinatorial therapy with propranolol.
Discussion
Malignant vascular tumors such as angiosarcomas and meta￾static hemangioendotheliomas are rare solid tumors that readily
metastasize due to their intrinsic vascular nature. These tumors
are exceptionally difficult to treat and several phase II trials
investigating the therapeutic efficacy of novel anti-angiogenic
drugs such as Bevacizumab, Sunitinib, and Sorafenib have
resulted in a minimal to absent response in vascular tumor
patients [30,31,32]. Of the three drugs, Sorafenib exhibited an
angiosarcoma subtype-specific response in 14% of patients,
however the median progression free survival was only 3.8
months, with 81% of angiosarcoma patients and 100% of
hemangioendothelioma patients exhibiting tumor progression
after 6 months of treatment [32]. This indicates the strong need
to develop more effective therapies against malignant vascular
tumors.
Given that we (Figure 1A–C) and others have demonstrated
that malignant vascular tumors express high levels of beta
adrenergic receptors [15,26], we hypothesized that beta blockade
might demonstrate therapeutic efficacy against these tumors. We
reveal that propranolol selectively inhibits proliferation, survival,
and migration of a panel of malignant vascular tumor cells,
indicating that the oncogenic properties of these tumor types are
driven, in part, by beta adrenergic signaling. While propranolol
dramatically slows the proliferation rate of all vascular tumor lines
tested, four of the five tumor lines exhibited nearly 100% lethality
at doses that we have previously reported to be non-toxic for
primary cultures of human endothelial cells (Figure 2A) [26].
Indeed, co-culture of HDMVECs and angiosarcoma cells in the
presence of propranolol results in selective killing of the
angiosarcoma cells (Figure 4H). These findings indicate that
malignant vascular tumor lines are exquisitely sensitive to beta
blockade and provide strong support for its use in animal and
human models. It should be noted that while beta blockade was
effective in reducing the proliferation rate and increasing cellular
apoptosis for all cell lines, there were varying levels of resistance
between the lines. For instance, the SB line exhibited high
resistance to propranolol-induced alterations in proliferation and
apoptosis (Figure 2A, Figure 5A & B), while the EOMA
hemangioendothelioma cell line consistently showed the highest
susceptibility to beta blockade. Future studies should elucidate the
molecular profiles characteristic of each of these lines that might
serve as putative biomarkers of susceptibility to propranolol.
Our data demonstrate that propranolol blocks proliferation and
survival in part through altering levels of key cell cycle and
apoptotic regulators (Figures 3 & 4). Our data indicates that
propranolol induces a strong upregulation of Tek. Tek is
preferentially expressed on endothelial cells, encodes for the
Tie2 angiogenic receptor, and strongly promotes vessel regression,
quiescence, and stability in a context dependent manner [33]. We
suspect that in addition to general cell cycle alterations,
propranolol’s specificity for vascular tumors may function through
Tie2-mediated modulation of vessel stability and maturation,
however the Ang/Tie2 network is a very complex signaling
pathway interdependent on a number of other proteins, thus
future work should address this issue.
Using two in vivo tumor models we demonstrated efficacy for
propranolol as an anti-angiosarcoma agent. However, propranolol
as a stand-alone therapeutic (like most therapeutics) did not
completely abolish tumor cell proliferation as evidenced by
positive PCNA staining in propranolol treated tumors. Given
our exciting data showing synergistic effects on malignant vascular
tumor lines treated with combined propranolol and chemotherapy
(Figure 5A), future emphasis should be placed on determining
the optimal strategy for beta blockade against hemangioendothe￾liomas and angiosarcomas. Indeed, a recent publication reported
propranolol potentiates the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy in
preclinical models of breast cancer [10]. Such an endeavor should
not prove difficult given that propranolol has been used extensively
to treat hypertension, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome
since its Nobel Prize winning discovery in the 1960’s, and its
toxicity and side effects are well established in pediatric and adult
patients.
In this study, we employ a novel application of beta blockade for
the successful treatment of malignant vascular tumors using in vitro
and in vivo models. These findings are significant because
metastatic hemangioendotheliomas and angiosarcomas are very
rare aggressive tumor types that are markedly understudied,
exceptionally difficult to treat, and result in high patient mortality.
These data lay the groundwork for future clinical trials to test the
off-label use of the generic drug propranolol for a population of
patients in desperate need of effective tumor treatments.
