The risk and importance of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus (TT-HEV) infections by 
contaminated blood products is currently a controversial discussed topic in transfusion 
medicine. The infectious dose, in particular, remains an unknown quantity. In the present 
study, we illuminate and review this aspect seen from the viewpoint of a blood donation 
service with more than 2 years of experience in routine HEV blood donor screening. We 
systematically review the actual status of presently known cases of TT-HEV infections 
and available routine NAT-screening assays. The review of the literature revealed a 
significant variation regarding the infectious dose causing hepatitis E. We also present 
the outcome of six cases confronted with HEV-contaminated blood products, identified 
by routine HEV RNA screening of minipools using the highly sensitive RealStar HEV 
RT-PCR Kit (95% LOD: 4.7 IU/mL). Finally, the distribution of viral RNA in different blood 
components [plasma, red blood cell concentrate (RBC), platelet concentrates (PC)] was 
quantified using the first WHO international standard for HEV RNA for NAT-based assays. 
None of the six patients receiving an HEV-contaminated blood product from five different 
donors (donor 1: RBC, donor 2–5: APC) developed an acute hepatitis E infection, most 
likely due to low viral load in donor plasma (<100 IU/mL). Of note, the distribution of 
viral RNA in blood components depends on the plasma content of the component; 
nonetheless, HEV RNA could be detected in RBCs even when low viral plasma loads of 
100–1,000 IU/mL are present. Comprehensive retrospective studies of TT-HEV infection 
offered further insights into the infectivity of HEV RNA-positive blood products. Minipool 
HEV NAT screening (96 samples) of blood donations should be adequate as a routine 
screening assay to identify high viremic donors and will cover at least a large part of 
viremic phases.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging infectious threat to blood safety. In the recent decade, there 
have been several reports of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus (TT-HEV) infection [for 
review, see Ref. (1)], although the risk of infection through consumption of raw or undercooked 
pork and wild boar is even greater (2). In industrialized countries, HEV infection, mainly with 
genotype 3, usually causes an acute, self-limiting, asymptomatic, or mild hepatitis. However, the 
significance of HEV genotype 3 infections has changed because chronic hepatitis with rapidly

progressive cirrhosis in organ transplant recipients and patients 
with hematological malignancy, as well as fulminant hepatitis in 
patients with chronic liver disease, have been observed (1, 3). 
HEV-infected immunocompromised patients develop chronic 
hepatitis E in approximately 60% of cases (4).
Since 2004, HEV has gained importance as a transfusion 
transmissible infectious agent, although earlier reports pointed 
to the risk of infection (5, 6). HEV has been transmitted 
in samples of red blood cells, platelet preparations, pooled 
granulocytes, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (solvent-detergent 
treated, amotosalen-treated, secured by quarantine). As a result, 
the public health implications of HEV in Europe have gained 
greater momentum due to an increasing number of hepatitis E 
cases and recent reports of chronic, persistent HEV infections 
associated with progression to cirrhosis in immunosuppressed 
patients. The question of hepatitis E and contribution of NAT 
screening on blood safety is currently extensively discussed, not 
only by several European committees and local blood authori￾ties but also internally by a large number of blood transfusion 
facilities. Domanovic questioned the situation as “a shift to 
screening” and summarized the epidemiology of HEV infec￾tions among blood donors and outlined strategies to prevent 
TT-HEV in 11 European countries (7). A nationwide HEV RNA 
screening of blood donations was introduced in Ireland, the UK, 
and recently the Netherlands. Several blood establishments in 
Germany, France, and recently Switzerland perform selective 
screening intended for use in high-risk patients or universal 
screening for HEV RNA. Blood authorities in Greece, Portugal, 
Italy, and Spain are evaluating the situation (7). Regardless of the 
risk of HEV transmission via blood products, most authorities 
have recommended HEV monitoring of immunosuppressed 
patients. The implementation of a HEV run control for screen￾ing human plasma pools requested by the Ph. Eur. 1646 (8) is 
another indication toward a transfusion relevance of HEV. So far, 
there have been only specific case reports of HEV transmission 
by SD-treated plasma (SDP) but not by other plasma-derived 
medicinal products. However, it is not unlikely that cases 
might have been overlooked due to diagnostic failure (9). Past 
serologic investigations in Japan implicated coagulation factors 
in the transmission of HEV. The conclusion was based on the 
significantly higher prevalence of HEV antibody in hemophilia 
patients receiving coagulation factors that were not subjected 
to virus inactivation or removal, compared with patients who 
received virus-inactivated coagulation factors (10). Cost￾effectiveness analyses were carried out in the Netherlands to 
assess whether an appropriate measure should be implemented 
for blood donor screening (11). The analysis led to the conclusion 
that the prevention of HEV transmission through the screen￾ing of blood donations is not markedly expensive compared 
with other blood-screening measures. However, the key issue 
of these cost-effectiveness analyses is the minimum viral load 
required to be detected in the donor blood. Thus, attention is 
now focused on the limit of detection of NAT (ID versus pool 
NAT), which is primary influenced by the minimum infectious 
dose of a blood product triggering an infection in the recipi￾ent. The German Advisory Committee on Blood (Arbeitskreis 
Blut) recommended a NAT sensitivity of 100 IU HEV RNA/mL 
[per single donation (12)], which is difficult to achieve with the 
currently available NAT assays using minipool NAT. For these 
reasons, the ongoing discussions address the question of the 
most appropriate and effective strategy to minimize the risk of 
TT-HEV infection, taking into account the costs, the logistics 
of testing, and the infection risk and outcome of HEV-infected 
blood recipients. The present review provides a comprehensive 
view of the various aspects of TT-HEV infection and a discus￾sion on the current status on the issue of screening for this virus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
HEV RNA Screening, Serological Testing, 
and Measurement of Liver-Specific 
Parameters in Blood Donors and 
Transfusion Recipients
Routine HEV RNA screening of therapeutic blood products 
was introduced in our blood donation service in January 2015. 
From January 2015 to July 2017, a total of 235,524 donations 
from 86,933 donors were screened for the presence of HEV RNA 
revealing 182 HEV RNA-positive donors. For four of these HEV 
RNA-positive donors, a lookback procedure need to be initiated, 
and a total of nine viremic previous donations of these donors 
were identified, which were transfused to six different recipients 
(Table 1).
Hepatitis E virus RNA-positive blood donors were identi￾fied using the RealStar HEV RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics, 
Hamburg, Germany), as described previously (13). Total nucleic 
acid (RNA/DNA) was extracted from 500  µL of donor and 
recipient samples using the NucliSens easyMAG (bioMerieux, 
Nürtingen, Germany) automated RNA/DNA extraction system 
followed by HEV RNA detection using the RealStar HEV RT-PCR 
Kit (13). HEV titer of positive samples was quantified using the 
first WHO international standard for HEV RNA for NAT-based 
assays (Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany). The linear 
range of quantification was from 25 to 10E+07 IU/mL.
Screening for the presence of HEV-specific IgM and IgG anti￾bodies was performed using the Anti-HEV ELISA (IgM and IgG, 
Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Serum concentrations of glutamate dehydrogenase 
(GLDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT), and total bilirubin were measured in plasma 
samples using the respective enzymatic assays on the Architect 
system (Abbott Diagnostics Europe, Wiesbaden, Germany). All 
HEV-infected donors underwent pre-donation medical examina￾tion and negated current diseases or any known risk factors for 
viral infection. The study protocol followed the ethical guidelines 
of the Ruhr University, Bochum, and was approved by the institu￾tional review board; donors provided informed consent.
Processing of Blood Products and 
Quantification of the Viral Load
Apheresis-derived single-donor PCs (APCs) were prepared after 
standard processing with the Haemonetics MCS + (Haemonetics 
GmbH, München, Germany). The final product consisted

of 2.0–4.0  ×  10E+11  platelets/unit (205–295  mL) contain￾ing 0.76–0.84  mL/mL human plasma and 0.16–0.24 mL/mL 
ACD-A stabilizer. For the preparation of RBC, whole blood 
donations were collected into a multiple bag system with 
inline filtration for leukoreduction (CompoFlow quadruple 4F, 
70-mL CPD/100-mL PAGGS-M—WB + PDS-V, Fresenius Kabi 
Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany), followed by 
centrifugation of the filtered whole blood unit at 4,182 × g and 
22°C for 45 min. Automated fractionation was carried out using 
the CompoMat G5 separator (Fresenius Kabi), and RBCs were 
stored directly at 4 ± 2°C. The final product volume averaged 
from 200 to 400 mL. The residual plasma volume was estimated 
to be 10 mL per RBC. The corresponding plasma products (FFP) 
contained a total volume of 180–380 mL with 0.75–0.82 mL/mL 
human plasma.
Viral RNA in the different blood components (FFP, RBC, RBC 
supernatant, PC) was extracted from 4.8-mL sample with the 
Chemagic Viral DNA/RNA reagent kit (Viral 5k, PerkinElmer 
Chemagen Technology GmbH, Baesweiler, Germany) combined 
with the automated Chemagic magnetic separation module 
MSMI (PerkinElmer Chemagen Technology GmbH) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the recovery of RBC 
supernatant, 50 mL of RBC were transferred to EDTA-containing 
monovettes followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 rpm. 
Therefore, the RBC supernatant contained CPD/PAGGS-M sta￾bilizator and a minimal proportion of residual plasma. For RNA 
extraction of RBCs, the alternative lysis buffer CMG-825 (lysis 
buffer blood, PerkinElmer Chemagen Technology GmbH) was 
used. The 95% lower limit of detection was calculated by Probit 
analysis to 4.7 IU/mL [confidence interval: 3.6–7.5 IU/mL (13)] 
for FFP, PC, and RBC supernatant and to 8.9 IU/mL (confidence 
interval: 6.5–21.1 IU/mL) for RBCs.
Searching Criteria
For the systematic review of HEV cases, the PubMed database 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), a public search engine 
maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine 
(NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that provides 
access to over 24 million citations in all fields of life sciences, 
mostly from the MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and 
retrieval System Online), was searched for publications between 
2004 and 2017 (publications dates) using specific search strings 
including “hepatitis E/HEV infection,” “transfusion transmitted 
hepatitis E/HEV infection,” and “hepatitis E/HEV blood donor 
screening.”
Statistical Analysis
All values are given as mean ± SD. Median values and SD were cal￾culated and Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was performed 
using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San 
Diego, CA, USA). Statistical analysis to assess differences between 
values was performed using the Mann–Whitney U test.

2017 is summarized in chronological order of occurrence in Table 
S1 in Supplementary Material. Cases including those patients 
who died shortly after transfusion for reasons other than HEV 
infection were excluded. We further describe six new cases of 
patients transfused with HEV-contaminated blood products, and 
none of the recipients developed HEV infection.
Case Description
Table 1 summarizes the donor and recipient information of all six 
cases. Anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies were not detected in any 
HEV RNA-positive donor and serum concentrations of GLDH, 
AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were all within normal range (data 
not shown). The presence of HEV RNA was confirmed in a sec￾ondary sample. Additionally, the corresponding plasma product 
of the RBC of donor 1 was available and the presence of HEV 
RNA was further confirmed. Donors 1 and 4 did not return for 
blood donation after HEV infection. For the other two donors, 
anti-HEV IgG seroconversion was observed after 149 days (donor 
2) and 116 days (donor 3) after the first HEV RNA-positive dona￾tion. For HEV genotyping of all donor samples, HEV-nucleotide 
sequence, corresponding to a 242-bp fragment of the ORF1 
region, was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that the samples clustered together and were related to 
HEV genotype 3, which is prevalent in Germany.
All recipients were anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG negative 
at the time of transfusion of HEV RNA-positive blood products. 
The viral load in plasma samples of donors 1, 2, and 4 was deter￾mined to be 17, 12, and 20 IU/mL, respectively. These values 
were below the linear range of quantification (<25 IU/mL), and 
therefore a maximum infectious dose was calculated assuming 
a viral load of 25 IU/mL. Recipient 1, an immunocompromised 
man after heart transplantation, received one RBC. Assuming a 
residual plasma volume of 10 mL per RBC, the maximum cor￾responding infectious dose was calculated as 250 IU. This patient 
did not develop HEV infection within the follow-up period of 
134 days, and neither HEV RNA nor anti-HEV antibodies were 
detectable.
Each apheresis platelet donation resulted in two APCs. The 
two immunocompetent recipients R2 and R3 received APCs 
from donor 2 with infectious doses of 4.68E+03  IU (APC1) 
and 4.86E+03 IU (APC2), assuming an average residual plasma 
volume of 0.8 mL per APC. Neither patients developed an HEV 
infection within the follow-up period of 35 days (recipient R2) 
or 50 days (recipient R3); moreover, no HEV RNA or anti-HEV 
antibodies were detectable. Accordingly, recipient R6 received 
two apheresis platelets (APC1: 242 mL, APC2: 244 mL) from 
donor 4 with a total maximum infectious dose of 7.97E+03 IU 
(total volume transfused: 486 mL), but she died shortly after 
transfusion for reasons other than HEV infection.
Donor 3 donated platelets regularly approximately every 
14  days and showed the highest viral load compared with the 
other donors. The first viremic donation (donation 1) contained 
27.8 IU/mL HEV RNA, and the second donation, 18 days later 
(donation 2), contained 69.4  IU/mL HEV RNA. The double 
APCs were transfused to two immunocompetent recipients 
(recipients R4 and R5). Recipient 4 received a total infectious 
dose of 1.08E+04 IU HEV RNA (donation 1, total volume of 
484 mL, APC1: 230 mL, APC2: 254 mL). This patient did not 
develop an acute HEV infection within 16 days after transfusion, 
and neither HEV RNA nor anti-HEV antibodies were detectable. 
However, the observation period was short and the possibility 
that HEV infection may have occurred later could not be ruled 
out. This patient was released from hospital and unfortunately 
no follow-up samples were sent to our laboratory for further 
follow-up. The second HEV-positive donation of donor 3 had 
a total infectious dose corresponding to 2.71E+04 IU HEV 
RNA (donation 2, transfusion of a total volume of 488-mL 
APC, APC1, and APC2: 244 mL). The recipient (R5) of these 
two apheresis platelets died shortly after transfusion for reasons 
other than HEV infection.
The cases of recipients 4–6 were excluded from the subsequent 
overview due to the short follow-up period.
Distribution of Viral RNA in Different Blood 
Products
In order to determine if a reduction of the viral load occurs 
during the manufacturing process of blood products, e.g., by 
centrifugation or by adsorption to components of the blood bag 
system, including the filter used for leukoreduction, viral loads 
were quantified in the plasma of HEV RNA-positive donors and 
additionally quantified in the corresponding blood products, 
FFP and RBC. Results from the respective blood products were 
correlated with the expected viral loads calculated with quanti￾fied results for plasma of HEV RNA-positive donors, assuming 
no removal during the production process. Calculation of virus 
titer assumed a mean plasma content of 0.80 mL/mL human 
plasma (80%) for FFP. For RBCs, the remaining plasma volume 
of 10 mL per RBC was assumed for consideration of the total 
volume of each individual RBC after processing. A total of 
73 value pairs were available for correlation analysis of FFPs 
(Figure 1A), of which three were excluded due to low viral load 
(<25 IU/mL). Likewise, a total of 73 value pairs were available 
for RBC (Figure 1B), of which 31 with low viral load (<25 IU/
mL) were excluded. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed a 
good correlation of r = 0.9418 (95% CI: 0.9065–0.9641) for FFP 
and a good correlation of r = 0.9290 (95% CI: 0.8538–0.9663) 
for RBC. The wider distribution between the measured and 
calculated HEV titer in RBC is based on the considerably lower 
plasma amount of only 10 mL per RBC (mean RBC volume 268 
mL, mean plasma proportion 3.7%) and the resultant higher 
method-specific quantification error.
In order to determine if HEV RNA or virus particles are bound 
to the surface of red blood cells, HEV RNA was quantified in 20 
different RBCs as well as in the cell-free supernatants of RBCs 
(Figure 1C). Spearman’s correlation analysis again revealed a good 
correlation of r = 0.9390 (95% CI: 0.8492–0.9760), indicating that 
no specific binding to red blood cell surfaces had occurred.
Figure  2 displays the distribution of viral RNA in FFP and 
RBC depending on the viral load, quantified in the plasma of 
HEV RNA-positive donors. HEV RNA was detected in the RBCs 
of all donations where the viral load in plasma was quantified 
as >1,000 IU/mL (Figure 2A). Quantified FFPs contained a total 
mean volume of 287 mL, corresponding to a total plasma volume 
of 230 mL. Comparison of the quantified mean values for FFP 

FIGURE 1 | Correlation of calculated and effectively quantified viral load in fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and red blood cell concentrate (RBC) and correlation of viral 
load in RBC and RBC supernatant. Displayed is the correlation between the effectively quantified hepatitis E virus (HEV) titer and the expected viral load in FFP (A)
and RBC (B). Calculation of the expected viral load in FFP is based on quantification results of HEV viral load in plasma of donors assuming a mean plasma content 
of 0.8 mL/mL plasma in the corresponding plasma product. Calculation of the expected viral load in RBC is based on quantification results of HEV viral load in 
plasma of donors assuming a residual plasma content of 10 mL/RBC. (C) Correlation of the effectively quantified HEV titer in RBC and RBC supernatant. The linear 
range of quantification was from 25 to 10E+07 IU/mL. Therefore, all values <25 IU/mL were excluded.
FIGURE 2 | Distribution of viral load in different blood products. The hepatitis E virus (HEV) titer in plasma of donors and the corresponding blood products fresh 
frozen plasma (FFP) and red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) was quantified using the first WHO international standard for HEV RNA for NAT-based assays. The 
distinction of viral loads >1,000 IU/mL (A) and ≤1,000 IU/mL (B) is based on quantification results of HEV viral load in plasma of donors, not in the corresponding 
blood products. Equal symbols present quantification results in different blood products from the same donor, quantification was performed in quadruplicate. The 
linear range of quantification was from 25 to 10E+07 IU/mL. Values <25 IU/mL were displayed as 25 IU/mL. For RBCs with low viral loads, not all replicates were 
positive for HEV RNA. Results were displayed as follows: 0 IU/mL: 0/4 positive replicates; 6.25 IU/mL: 1/4 positive replicates; 12.5 IU/mL: 2/4 positive replicates; 
18.75 IU/mL: 3/4 positive replicates; and 25 IU/mL: 4/4 positive replicates (quantification results <25 IU/mL). The solid horizontal line represents mean values, and 
the dotted horizontal line is representative for the value 25 IU/mL.

(2.34E+04 ±  4.08E+04 IU/mL) with those obtained for RBCs 
(6.29E+02 ± 1.05E+03 IU/mL) revealed the percentage propor￾tion of 2.7% for RBCs, essentially corresponding to the calculated 
mean plasma proportion of 3.7%.
For RBCs, where the viral load in plasma was quanti￾fied >1,000  IU/mL (Figure  2B), a maximum viral load of 25 
IU/mL was detected and often not all replicates were positive 
for HEV RNA. Negative results might either indicate that RBC

contains no viral RNA or the viral load is below the detection 
limit of the assay (8.9 IU/mL).
DISCUSSION
German public health authorities have recognized an increasing 
number of acute HEV infections, which is probably due to higher 
clinical awareness but more likely due to detection of HEV￾infected asymptomatic blood donors identified through NAT 
screening by blood donation establishments. A high frequency of 
HEV viremic donors have been reported in recent large screening 
studies in several European countries (13–17). The asymptomatic 
infection is mostly characterized by a period of asymptomatic 
viremia, with an estimated duration of 68 days (18). The typical 
serological course of an acute HEV infection showed detectable 
IgM antibodies following an incubation period of 2–6  weeks, 
decline to baseline levels within three to 6 month, followed by 
longer lasting IgG antibodies which remains detectable for up to 
15 years (19–21). The progression of anti-HEV immunoglobulins 
in asymptomatic cases is comparable with symptomatic cases (22). 
However, the factual incidence of TT-HEV infection and the real 
clinical importance is currently unknown. The rate of reported 
TT-HEV infections is very small, probably due to underreport￾ing, failure to recognize or misinterpretation of symptoms (23), or 
development of HEV infection long after transfusion, hampering 
any association with an earlier transfusion event (24). Moreover, 
the occurrence of primary asymptomatic infection in recipients is 
certainly an option. Besides a recent large study in England (24), 
only a small number of individual cases of TT-HEV infection 
(Table S1 in Supplementary Material) and cases of transfusion 
of HEV-containing blood without TT-HEV infection (Table S2 
in Supplementary Material) have been described (14, 23, 25–46). 
The large 2012–2013 study in England retrospectively screened 
225,000 English blood donors for HEV by NAT. Follow-up of 
the recipients who had received HEV genotype 3-contaminated 
blood components indicated that 42% had evidence of TT-HEV 
infection, with transmission possibly linked to the absence of 
HEV-specific antibodies (24). A high virus load in the donor, 
corresponding with the volume of plasma transfused with the 
final blood component, rendered infection more likely. Moreover, 
multiple different kinds of blood products were involved, but the 
transmission rates varied. Of all transfused RBC, only 25% caused 
HEV infection, whereas 40% of transfused PPCs, 50% of trans￾fused APCs, and 100% of transfused FFPs or pooled granulocytes 
caused HEV infection (24).
Analysis of 19 Japanese cases of TT-HEV infection by Satake 
et  al. found a comparable rate of infection of 50% (29). All 
TT-HEV cases present in the Satake’s study were included in our 
case analysis (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). The studies 
by Satake et al. and Hewitt et al. [18 patients (24)] also identified 
several patients transfused with HEV-contaminated components 
without the development of HEV infection [5 patients (29), 18 
patients (24)], but these cases were not considered in Table S2 
in Supplementary Material because no detailed case descriptions 
are available.
Unfortunately, some cases only revealed poor data sets, miss￾ing important facts for both, the recipients of contaminated blood 
products or the respective donors. For example, the pretransfu￾sion serostatus in recipients is often only assumable based on 
the posttransfusion status, or the serostatus is entirely absent. 
The serological status of the blood donors is also often missing. 
Additionally, the duration between transfusion, determination 
of infection, and follow-up of patients including the accompany￾ing therapy and laboratory parameters is often incomplete or 
untraceable. Most important, the viral HEV load and the result￾ing infectious dose is not determined. Taken into consideration 
only the individual cases included in Tables S1 and S2 where the 
viral load infused is available, 39 patients received blood products 
containing HEV, of whom 28 patients develop TT-HEV infection.
Tedder and colleagues performed an estimation of the infec￾tious dose of the individual blood product types involved in the 
UK study in a subsequent analysis, demonstrating that com￾ponents causing TT-HEV infection had a considerably higher 
median infectious dose of 1.44E+06 IU than components not 
causing TT-HEV infection [median total viral load transfused: 
2.40E+04 IU (2, 24)]. Accordingly to this study, our systematic 
case review analysis showed a significant difference in the 
median viral load transfused between HEV-infected (median: 
5.20E+05 IU, this study) and non-infected patients (median: 
1.91E+03 IU, p < 0.0001, Figure 3A). Statistical significant dif￾ferences in the median viral load transfused were also observed 
between HEV-infected (median: 4.40E+05 IU) and non-infected 
non-immunocompromised patients (median: 1.91E+03 IU, 
p = 0.0002), whereas no differences were observed between 
HEV-infected (median: 4.80E+05 IU) and non-infected immu￾nocompromised patients (median: 1.55+04 IU, p = 0.1006). 
When the immune status of the recipient, which was mentioned 
to have a major impact on the actual risk of TT-HEV infection, 
was also taken into account, no differences were observed in the 
median viral load transfused between immunocompromised 
and non-immunocompromised patients, independently from 
the infection outcome (HEV-infected, p =  0.6286; non-HEV￾infected, p =  0.5044). The lowest infectious dose resulting in 
TT-HEV infection observed in general was 7.05E+03 IU. When 
the type of blood product was considered, the lowest infectious 
dose transfused was 7.05E+03 IU for PCs without subdivision 
of APC and PPCs, 3.16E+04 IU for RBCs, and 3.60E+04 IU for 
FFPs (Figure 3B). Tedder et al. demonstrated that the lowest dose 
of virus resulting in an infection was 2.00E+04 IU, whereby only 
55% of the components containing this dose transmitted an infec￾tion (2). Among non-transmitting components, 60% contained 
or exceeded this infectious dose. Satake et al. summarized that 
infusion of total viral loads between 2.00E+04 IU and 2.60E+05 
IU can occur without HEV transmission (29). In our systematic 
case review analysis, all components with a viral load >5.00E+04 
IU caused infection (Figure 3A), independently from the immune 
status of the recipient; however, only one of the non-transmitting 
components exceeded this value. Furthermore, the pretransfu￾sion serostatus of recipients receiving HEV-contaminated blood 
products might have an impact on the development of HEV 
infection. With the exception of three cases in the study by Hewitt 
et al. (24) and two additional cases (29, 38, 39, 46), all described 
cases had a seronegative pretransfusion status. Future studies 
including IgG positive pretransfusion cases might contribute to

the assessment of a protective effect of previous experienced HEV 
infection or the effectiveness of future available vaccination of 
donors and/or at risk recipients.
In addition to the cases mentioned in Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material, Arankalle et al. described two cases of putative, but in 
our opinion unlikely, posttransfusion hepatitis. HEV infection 
was assumed due to seroconversion of both patients within weeks 
after transfusion, but no HEV RNA was detected in patients for 
comparative sequence analysis. Additionally, donor screening of 
five of the six involved donations revealed no HEV RNA (6). In 
Japan, seven further posttransfusion hepatitis E cases (six cases 
of RBC transfusion, one case of PC transfusion) were detected, 
according to the official announcement of the Japanese Red Cross 
Society, but no information on either donor or patient antibody 
status or the infectious dose were available (26). The German 
authorities also announced four further posttransfusion hepatitis 
E cases (two RBC, two PC) in their actual hemovigilance report 
so far, without detailed case information (47).
The lack of a small animal model and efficient cell culture sys￾tem has hampered the study of HEV replication, pathogenesis, 
and infectious dose determination. HEV isolates of genotypes 3 
and 4 have been adapted to grow in vitro, but HEV cell culture is 
inefficient and limited, and requires genetic modifications of the 
HEV isolates (48–51). Experimental HEV infection in the rhesus 
monkey model led to acute hepatitis E after transfusion of 10 
mL plasma from a HEV-infected donor (52). Immune-deficient 
human-liver chimeric mouse also serves as an appropriate model 
to study HEV genotype 1 and 3 infection, virus–host interac￾tions, and drug efficacy (53, 54). For example, chronic HEV 
infection was observed after intrasplenic injection of HEV-GT1-
containing preparation with an infectious dose of 2.5E+05 IU 
(53). These models could serve as a starting point to determine 
the infectivity and pathogenicity of HEV. However, it is currently 
questionable whether these models are faithful representation of 
human infection and could answer the question of infectious 
dose in humans.
The plasma proportion of the transfused blood product 
seemed to affect the risk for TT-HEV at most, but so far no infor￾mation is available on the partitioning of HEV into the different 
components from a single blood donation (9). It is conceivable 
that manufacturing processes during the fractionation of whole 
blood might result in lower viral loads than what is expected on 
the basis of viral plasma load of blood donors and the assumed 
residual plasma content. We have shown that the fractionation 
process in our blood transfusion facility does not considerably 
reduce the concentration of viral RNA, but this may not generally 
valid for other production processes.
The question remains as to which screening strategy is 
necessary and practicable. Screening may constitute a universal 
approach to include all blood products or a selective screening 
can be performed for only the products that would be used in at￾risk patients. This issue is primarily influenced by two sides: the 
hospital-sided clear definition of at-risk patients and the logistic 
implications for the order of blood products, and supply and 
availability, managed by the blood establishment. The second 
question is whether minipool screening of up to 96 samples or 
ID testing is necessary. We would submit that the required detec￾tion limit, which need to be derived from the infectious dose, 
plays an important role for the second issue. Thus, the decision 
for ID or pool NAT depends on logistic and costs, which are 
in part dictated by the required sensitivity. Table 2 summarizes 
the currently available commercially HEV NAT-screening assays 
including the analytical sensitivities. The analytical sensitivity 
(95% LOD) of HEV NAT assays ranges from 4.7 to 18.6 IU/
mL, and all assays used for blood screening detected positive 
donations of all genotypes 1 to 4 and demonstrated a good

performance in routine testing (Table 2). In most settings, the 
Procleix HEV (Grifols) is used in individual testing (ID NAT), 
where the 95% LOD was determined to be 5.5–12.78 IU/mL, 
which is slightly different than that of the manufacturer’s value 
(15, 55). The disadvantage of current commercial HEV NAT 
assays is their requirement of special screening platforms that are 
fully integrated and automated, and not as flexible as open NAT 
platforms. For this reason, we introduced routine minipool HEV 
NAT screening (96 donations) using an in-house testing regime 
in our transfusion facility in January 2015. The setting of HEV 
NAT using RealStar HEV RT-PCR Kit 1.0 [Altona Diagnostics, 
95% LOD 4.7 IU/mL (CI: 3.6–7.6, 452 IU/mL) per single dona￾tion] is compatible to the virus NAT screening used in our blood 
transfusion service (13, 56). Our HEV NAT is comparable with 
commercial HEV NAT-screening methods (Table 2) in spite of 
a lower level of automation and throughput. The novel automa￾tion platform AltoStar allows ID NAT testing or alternatively a 
higher automation grade for pool NAT. It is to be noted that the 
sensitivity of the RealStar HEV RT-PCR Kit strongly depends 
on the nucleic-acid extraction method used, ranging from 4.7 
to 37.8 IU/mL (13, 55, 56). In our screening setting, we use 
the fully automated nucleic-acid extraction method Chemagic 
Viral DNA/RNA Kit that allows the processing of large plasma 
volumes (4.8 mL). Compared with the other commercial HEV 
NAT-screening methods from GFE Blut, Roche, and Grifols, the 
processed sample volume of our method is 3.7-fold, 5.6-fold, 
and 9.1-fold higher, respectively, resulting in a considerably 
higher number of HEV plasma-equivalents per PCR reaction. 
Therefore, this combination is, to the best of our knowledge, the 
most sensitive HEV NAT. It does not fully meet the sensitivity of 
100 IU HEV RNA/mL recommended by the German authorities, 
but at present, it is not clear whether this sensitivity is absolutely 
necessary. Our minipool screening strategy aims to identify high 
viremic donors and will cover at least a large part of viremic 
phases (22, 57). The European medicine agency so far has also 
recommended minipool screening in their reflection paper on

hepatitis E (9). However, it remains to be seen in the future 
whether all relevant viremic phases that could result in TT-HEV 
infections will be detected.
