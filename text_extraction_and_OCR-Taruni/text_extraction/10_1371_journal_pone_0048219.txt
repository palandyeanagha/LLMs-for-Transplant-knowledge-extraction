Abstract
Background: Among the Chinese population of 1.3 billion, there are an estimated 93 million carriers of hepatitis B virus
(HBV). Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HBV infection; however, the prevalence of HBV
immunization and infection among Chinese MSM remains undetermined.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,114 eligible participants was conducted in Beijing, China. Multiple methods were
used to recruit study participants. Demographic information and potential correlated factors were collected by
questionnaire. Additionally, blood specimens were collected and tested for sexually transmitted infections and serologic
markers of hepatitis B immunization and infection.
Results: Laboratory data were available for 1,111 participants (99.7%), the prevalence of hepatitis B immunization was
38.9%, and 26.5% had serologic markers of HBV infection. Multivariate analyses indicated that higher education level,
smaller number of male sex partners in the past 12 months, reported diagnosis of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and
history of blood donation were independently associated with HBV immunization. Absence of steady male sex partner(s) in
the past 12 months, and reported diagnosis of STD were shown to be independently associated with HBV infection. MSM
positive for HBV infection were more likely to have past or current syphilis infection.
Conclusions: Low prevalence of HBV immunization and high prevalence of HBV infection among Chinese MSM and a
correlation between sexual risk factors and hepatitis B infection indicate that comprehensive preventative measures for HBV
among MSM, including blood donor and HIV-STD clinic vaccination programs as well as targeted health education
campaigns should be developed in China.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health
concern due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with
cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. The World Health Organiza￾tion (WHO) estimates that two billion people worldwide have been
infected with HBV, and more than 350 million have chronic (long￾term) liver infections [1]. In the Chinese population of 1.3 billion
individuals, there are estimated to be 93 million HBV carriers.
Each year, 300,000 deaths are attributed to chronic hepatitis B,
including deaths associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [2].
HBV infection is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and is
50 to 100 times more infectious than the human immunodefi￾ciency virus (HIV) [3]. For individuals engaging in high-risk sexual
behavior, such as unprotected anal intercourse, men who have sex
with men (MSM) are at an increased risk of infection with HBV,
HIV, syphilis, and other STIs. To control hepatitis B, the Chinese
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e48219

government has implemented infant vaccination with hepatitis B
vaccine as the highest priority, thereby, hepatitis B vaccine
coverage (3 doses) increased from 30.0% for children born in 1992
to 93.4% for children born in 2005 [4], and hepatitis B vaccine
catch-up immunization has been extended to adolescents under 15
years of age in year 2009 [5]. In order to improve the current
national hepatitis B vaccine immunization strategy, evaluating
hepatitis B immunization among high risk populations such as
MSM is needed.
In China, previous studies on MSM have primarily focused on
HIV and syphilis infection [6–12]. Some studies, however, have
reported HBV prevalence in terms of Hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) positive rates. Despite these reports, HBV infection
prevalence is poorly represented by the determination of HBsAg
alone [13]. Furthermore, no reports on hepatitis B immunization
among Chinese MSM have been published to date.
The current study aims to: (1) assess the prevalence of HBV
infection among MSM in Beijing, China; (2) explore risk factors
associated with HBV infection and the association of HBV
infection with other STIs (HIV, syphilis) and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection; and (3) assess hepatitis B immunization rate and
thus explore factors associated with immunization among MSM in
Beijing, China.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Beijing
YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.
Written informed consent was obtained from each participant
involved in this study. For participants under the age of eighteen,
written informed consents were obtained from their guardians. All
participants’ information were kept confidential and tracked
anonymously with an identification number only.
Study Design and Population
From March 2010 to June 2011, a cross-sectional study of 1,111
eligible participants was conducted among MSM in Beijing,
China. The following three strategies were used to recruit MSM
into the study: (1) web-based advertisements on www.bjboy.net
targeting MSM in Beijing; (2) distribution of information leaflets
by trained peer recruiters at MSM-frequented venues, such as
MSM bars, bathhouses, and parks; and (3) peer referral by current
study participants. All potential participants participated in
voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) clinic at the Beijing
YouAn Hospital for eligibility assessment. Participants were
screened against the following eligibility criteria: (1) aged 16 years
or older; (2) self-reported anal sex with another male within the
past 6 months; (3) willingness to participate in the study and to
provide written informed consent; and (4) had not participated in
this study previously. Potential participants meeting the above
criteria were asked to participate in a face-to-face interview using a
prepared questionnaire and to provide blood specimens for
laboratory testing. Trained medical doctors provided all potential
participants with risk reduction counseling on HIV/acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmit￾ted diseases (STDs). At this point, each eligible study participant
was assigned a unique study identification code and provided with
the telephone number of the research department. Thus,
participants were able to anonymously retrieve blood test results
within a two week period following collection. Participants testing
positive for any STI (syphilis, HBV, HIV) or HCV were referred
to the Beijing YouAn Hospital for treatment, and vaccination was
recommended to those who were susceptible to HBV (susceptible
group). Each participant was compensated 50 Chinese Yuan
(equivalent to $ 7.90) for time and transportation costs.
Data Collection
Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted by trained inter￾viewers on a one-to-one basis. The questionnaire included the
following measures on: (1) demographics such as age, education,
and income; (2) sexual behaviors such as number of sexual
partners, and the type of male sex partners (Steady partner(s) were
defined as sole sex partners in an ongoing relationship; casual
partner(s) were defined as sex partners with no social relationship);
(3) potential sexual or non-sexual risk factors for STD transmis￾sion, such as history of STDs or injection drug use); and (4) history
of HBV vaccination (assessed by self-report "yes/no/can not
remember"). Blood specimens from study participants were
collected in sterile ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)
tubes, aliquoted, and stored at 270uC for further testing.
Each completed questionnaire was linked to its corresponding
blood specimen through a unique study identification code.
Laboratory Testing
Blood specimens were tested for the serologic markers of HBV,
HIV, syphilis and HCV infections. Enzyme immunoassay
screening (Kehua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China)
was carried out to detect the presence of the following three
serologic markers: HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Vaccine-associ￾ated immunity was defined by the sole presence of anti-HBs.
Immunity due to natural infection (past infection) was defined by
the presence of anti-HBc and anti-HBs with an absence of HBsAg.
Susceptibility to HBV infection was defined as the complete
absence of these three serologic markers. Current HBV infection,
including acute infection and chronic infection, was defined by the
presence of HBsAg confirmed with anti-HBc. The above
interpretation of hepatitis B serologic test results was adapted
from the official website of the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), USA [14] and the Committee on the
Prevention and Control of Viral Hepatitis Infections, Institute of
Medicine of the National Academies, USA [13]. In addition, total
HBV infection was defined as the presence of HBsAg or anti-HBc.
HIV-1/2 infection status was first determined using enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Diagnostic Kit for Antibody
to Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Kehua Bio-engineering Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai, China), and positive specimens were transferred to
the HIV Confirmatory Laboratory of the Beijing Center for
Disease Control and Prevention. There, HIV-1/2 Western Blot
tests (HIV Blot 2.2 WBTM, Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore) were
used for confirmation.
The syphilis screening was performed by rapid plasma reagin
(RPR; Shanghai Kehua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China) and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay
conducted in parallel (TPPA; Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Thus,
all participants were tested by TPPA, and positive TPPA cases
were further tested by RPR. A seropositive result for TPPA was
defined as the presence of a past or current syphilis infection, while
a seropositive result for both TPPA and RPR was diagnosed as a
current syphilis infection.
HCV infection status was determined by presence of antibody
to HCV (anti-HCV) using ELISA (Kehua Bio-engineering Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai, China).
All diagnostic kits were licensed by the State Food and Drug
Administration, P. R. China.

Statistical Analysis
Questionnaire-based data and serological testing results were
recorded in duplicate using the EpiData software (EpiData 3.0 for
Windows, The EpiData Association, Odense Denmark). Data
validation tools were also used to validate duplicate data entry.
Because of the lack of concordance between self-reported
vaccination and serologic evidence of vaccination, only serologic
evidence was used as the marker of vaccination for data analysis.
To explore factors associated with hepatitis B vaccination, vaccine￾associated immunity and hepatitis B susceptible status were
compared. Those with serologic evidence of hepatitis B vaccina￾tion were unlikely to be infected with HBV, and therefore during
examination of associated factors for hepatitis B infection, only
data from the other groups (hepatitis B infected group and
susceptible group) were included in the analysis.
For univariate analyses examining factors associated with
immunization and infection, Mann-Whitney U tests were used
for continuous data because they were not normally distributed,
and x2 tests were used for categorical data. The significance level
was set at less than 0.05 (P,0.05).
To assess independent factors associated with immunization and
infection, two separate multiple logistic regression analyses using
forward unconditional modeling were performed. Variables
included in multivariable testing were those found to be associated
with the dependent variables (P,0.05) through univariate
analyses. Both adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) were obtained for each explanatory variable.
Variables with P,0.05 in multivariable analysis were considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) for Windows
(Version 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Participants
A total of 1,260 potential participants visited the VCT clinic
during the study period, they came in as a result of the three forms
of recruitment and were screened for eligibility. The distribution of
participants by method of recruitment was unknown. Among
them, 67 refused to provide written informed consent, 79 were not
eligible, and 3 did not provide suitable specimens. Analyses were
restricted to 1,111 (88.2%) eligible MSM who provided specimens
suitable for testing.
Among these 1,111 participants, the prevalence of HBsAg, anti￾HBc, HIV, and anti-HCV were 9.0%, 23.8%, 11.6%, and 3.9%,
respectively. A total of 368 (33.1%) participants seropositive for
TPPA were determined to have had past or current syphilis
infections, 149 (13.4%) participants seropositive for both TPPA
and RPR were diagnosed with current syphilis infections, and 34
(3.1%) participants were diagnosed with early syphilis (RPR titer
$1:16 with confirmatory TPPA). Table 1 presents the Hepatitis B
serologic panels, and Figure 1 shows the seroprevalence of
hepatitis B infection and vaccine-associated immunity by age
group. For participants under age 35 years, seroprevalence of
hepatitis B infection increased linearly with age, reaching lowest
(12.5%) values among participants aged 16–19 years and highest
(34.3%) values among participants aged 30–34 years (P = 0.001; x2
test for trend). No significant difference in the prevalence of
vaccine-associated immunity was found among variant age￾groups. Selected demographic and sexual behavior characteristics
of the 1,111 participants presenting valid samples are described in
Table 2.
Magnitude and Correlates of Vaccine-associated
Immunity
A total of 432 (38.9%) participants had serologic evidence of
hepatitis B vaccination (vaccine-associated immunity), 385 (34.7%)
participants were susceptible to HBV infection (Table 1), and 164
(14.8%) participants recalled a history of HBV vaccination. Both
HBV vaccination history and serologic evidence of vaccination
were observed in 80 (7.2%) participants. Vaccine-associated
immunity was observed in 80 (48.8%) who recalled a history of
HBV vaccination. Overall, 766 (68.9%) participants expressed
uncertainty about their history of HBV vaccination.
In the univariate analyses, prevalence of vaccine-associated
immunity increased with increasing education level, being the
lowest (42.6%) levels among those with junior high school
diplomas or lower and the highest (69.8%) levels among those
with graduate college diplomas (P,0.001; x2 test for trend).
Furthermore, men with serologic evidence of hepatitis B vaccina￾tion were more likely to be single, possess student status, have had
no more than 3 male sex partners in the past 12 months, have
reported STD diagnosis, and have a history of donating blood. In
a binary multivariate analysis using the forward logistic regression
model, four factors remained significantly associated with hepatitis
B vaccine-associated immunity: higher education level
(AOR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38, some college vs. junior high
school or less; AOR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.69–4.91, graduate college
vs. junior high school or less); more than 3 male sex partners in the
past 12 months (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54–0.98); reported STD
diagnosis (AOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.23–3.98), and history of blood
donation (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.00–2.03) (Table 3).
Univariate analyses indicate that prevalence of HBV immuni￾zation did not vary by age, ethnicity, native place, personal
income, having steady male sex partner(s) in the past 12 months,
or history of injected drug use.
Magnitude and Correlates of HBV Infection
Among the 1,111 participants, a total of 294 (26.5%) had
serologic evidence of HBV infection, 68 (6.1%) were currently
HBV infected, and 164 (14.8%) were immune due to natural
infection (Table 1).
Univariate analysis identified 3 factors associated with hepatitis
B infection, including absence of steady male sex partners in the
past 12 months, reported STD diagnosis, and history of injected
drug use. Multivariate analysis using forward stepwise logistic
regression confirmed that the presence of steady male sex
partner(s) over the past 12 months (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31–
0.82) and reported STD diagnosis (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.55–
5.03) were factors associated with hepatitis B infection (Table 4).
In addition, participants with serologic evidence of HBV
infection were more likely to have had past or current syphilis
infections (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.07–2.04, x2 test). Univariate
analyses indicate that prevalence of HBV infection did not vary by
the serologic test outcomes of HIV and HCV, ethnicity, education
level, native place, personal income, marital status, student status,
number of male sex partners in the past 12 months, or history of
blood donation.
Discussion
A novel examination of the prevalence and factors associated
with hepatitis B immunization and infection among a convenience
sample of the MSM population in Beijing, China was conducted.
The findings from this study suggest that a large portion of the
Chinese MSM population are still not vaccinated against hepatitis
B, despite the increased availability and affordability of the
Hepatitis B Immunization and Infection among MSM

vaccine. In fact, as little as 38.9% of MSM participants examined
in the current study presented evidence of prior vaccination,
additional work is required to raise awareness and increase
participation in vaccination programs.
In 1992, the hepatitis B vaccination was first introduced in
China, where its use was progressively expanded during the
following years. After nearly two decades of effort, the HBsAg
positive rate in the general population of China dropped from
9.75% in 1992 to 7.18% in 2006 [4]. In response to this relatively
slow reduction in infection rates, a hepatitis B vaccine catch-up
immunization program was initiated in 2009 and extended to all
children and adolescents in China under 15 years of age [5].
Therefore, it is likely that the current prevalence of HBsAg in the
general population may have decreased as vaccination coverage in
both children and adolescents increased. Notably, the prevalence
of HBsAg among MSM participants in the current study was
9.0%, a level notably higher than that observed in the general
population.
Based on an epidemiological study among the general
population in Beijing, the HBsAg prevalence was found to be
3.8% (176/4625) among participants over 15 years of age in year
2006 [15]. The HBsAg prevalence in the current study (9.0%) was
much higher than that of general population in Beijing. While
maternal-infant transmission of HBV infection was estimated to
account for 40–50% of HBV carriers in Chinese populations [16],
no evidence exists to suggest that there are different maternal￾infant transmission patterns of HBV infection between the general
population and MSM. Therefore, other modes of HBV transmis￾sion are likely to be involved in the increased HBsAg prevalence
among this MSM population. Consistent with previous research
[17–22], previous injection drug use and reported diagnosis of
STD were associated with increased HBV infection. In addition,
the status of having no steady male sex partner(s) in the past 12
months were shown to be independently associated with HBV
infection. Furthermore, men with HBV infection were more likely
to have past or current syphilis infections, further corroborating
that sexual behavior is an important mode of HBV transmission
among MSM. Although further research is required to assess the
modes of transmission affecting MSM populations and the
differences between the prevalence of such transmission modes
between MSM and general population, these findings suggest that
mode of transmission may be important in design of vaccination
and education programs.
The HBsAg positive rate in the current study was similar to, or
higher than, the HBsAg positive rates previously reported in other
studies targeting MSM populations in Beijing, China (7.5% in
2004, 8.0% and 8.8% in 2005, 10.3% in 2006, and 6.5% in 2007)
[7,8,23], demonstrating the ongoing transmission of HBV. Nearly
one of every three MSM in the current study were susceptible to
HBV infection, and no HBV vaccination programs specifically
targeting MSM in Beijing currently exist, which may be a primary
causative factor in the ongoing transmission of HBV among MSM
[24,25].
Several studies have reported hepatitis B immunization rates
among MSM in the United States (USA) (9% in 7 US
metropolitan areas between 1994 and 1998 [26], 24.5% in King
County, Washington between 1997 and 2000 [18], and 17.2% in
6 other US metropolitan areas between 1998 and 2000 [27]).
Although the hepatitis B immunization rate reported here (38.9%)
was higher than those reported in the USA, it cannot be assumed
that prevalence of hepatitis B immunization among MSM
populations in China is higher than that in the USA, particularly
in consideration of the fact that the majority of USA studies
available were carried out many years earlier than the current
study. Thus, these studies, while informative, are unlikely to reflect
the contemporary success of these growing vaccination programs.
A finding of higher hepatitis B immunization rates among MSM in
China with higher educational levels, consistent with similar
studies conducted in the USA [26], was encouraging. These
studies indicated that vigorous health education campaigns may be

a critical component in the successful promotion of vaccination in
MSM populations in China. Furthermore, blood donation was
independently associated with immunization, indicating that some
MSM knew their HBV susceptible status, likely from testing by the
blood bank. Such indicators likely result in increases in voluntary
vaccination due to increased health awareness, although other
explanations for this behavior may also exist. Reporting a
diagnosed STD was a predictor associated with both HBV
infection and HBV immunization, suggesting that some MSM
subjects acquired HBV infection through high-risk sexual contact,
whereas others sought vaccination due to previous infection with
other STDs. Thus, vaccination requirements for blood donors and
vaccination programs in HIV-STD clinics may also be effective
alternative methods for improving immunization rates in the
general population and, specifically, in MSM populations.
Of particular concern, participants who had more than 3 male
sex partners in the past 12 months showed lower immunization
rates (47.5%) compared with those who had between 1 and 3
partners (56.0%) during the same time period. More male sex
partners generally represents more opportunities for infection. The
current findings indicate that the seroprevalence of hepatitis B
infection increased linearly in sexually active age-groups (Figure 1),

underscoring the increasing need for health programs to aid in the
early identification and vaccination of at risk populations, such as
MSM. It is difficult, however, to identify such a target group due
to the failure of many MSM to report their sexual orientation to
health providers. Strategies for the achievement of a wider HBV
vaccination coverage among Chinese MSM should be a priority
for public health. Because many MSM individuals do not realize
the risks or severe clinical consequences associated with STIs,
raising awareness and increasing risk perception should be

Hepatitis B Immunization and Infection among MSM

incorporated into vaccination programs in order to effectively limit
the spread of viral hepatitis among MSM populations [28].
Interestingly, the conspicuous drop in prevalence of HBV
infection among MSM above 34 years of age is shown in Figure 1.
MSM above 34 years of age were less sexually active than those
under 34 years of age and therefore were at lower risks for HBV
infection through high-risk sex activities, which might account for
this finding (data not reported).
The results of the present study should be interpreted with
caution due to the limitations involved in the relatively small
sample size and representativeness of the sample investigated. The
recruitment methods produced a convenience sample of MSM
whose representation of any broader population of MSM in
Beijing is unknown; nonparticipants may possess different
demographic profiles or risk behaviors, indicative of variant STI
prevalence. Thus, within the present study may have resulted in
some degree of overestimation or underestimation of the true
prevalence of hepatitis B infection and other STIs in the Chinese
MSM population. Furthermore, questionnaire data relies heavily
on accurate retrospective self-reporting, a method inevitably
subject to some error due to both recall bias and the sensitive
nature of questions, such as those pertaining to drug use and
sexual behavior. Participant concern with the social desirability of
certain answers may be responsible for some error, though care
was taken to ensure anonymous data collection and thus
encourage accurate questionnaire responses. Also, due to the use
of only serologic evidence as the marker for vaccination, the report
of vaccine-associated immunity may have been misclassified.
Vaccine-induced anti-HBs may have waned below detectable
levels among some MSM who recalled a history of HBV
vaccination, which may explain the variation observed between
self-report data and serologic evidence of vaccination. Further￾more, for some men without a vaccination history, very low
exposure to HBV may have resulted in the development of anti￾HBs without infection [29].
In conclusion, low prevalence of vaccine-associated immunity
and high prevalence of HBV infection were observed among the
MSM population in Beijing, China. This study suggests that high￾risk sexual contact is an important mode of HBV transmission
among MSM individuals. It must be noted, however, that sexual
behavior characteristics correlated with hepatitis B infection do
not necessarily represent an association. This is due to the fact that
hepatitis B may have been acquired before the period of
assessment, and thus only a chance relationship exists. Hepatitis
B vaccination for all infants has been provided for free since 2005
in China [4], but no official policy has been formulated to promote
hepatitis B vaccination among MSM and other high-risk sexually
active populations. Despite the ready availability of hepatitis B
vaccination at a relatively low price (currently, approximately 20
Chinese Yuan, equivalent to $ 3.16 per dose, domestic), these
results show that a considerable portion of the MSM population in
Beijing, China were not vaccinated, thus remaining at risk for
HBV infection. Comprehensive preventative measures for HBV
among MSM should be developed. As primary strategies, hepatitis
B vaccination requirements for blood donors and vaccination
programs in HIV-STD clinics are recommended. In addition,
targeted promotion of health education campaigns among MSM
populations may raise awareness and thus increase voluntary
vaccinations.
