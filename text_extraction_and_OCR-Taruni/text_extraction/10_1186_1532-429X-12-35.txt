reflected by transverse rather than longitudinal 
wall motion in pulmonary hypertension

Abstract
Background: Longitudinal wall motion of the right ventricle (RV), generally quantified as tricuspid annular systolic 
excursion (TAPSE), has been well studied in pulmonary hypertension (PH). In contrast, transverse wall motion has been 
examined less. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate regional RV transverse wall motion in PH, and its relation 
to global RV pump function, quantified as RV ejection fraction (RVEF).
Methods: In 101 PH patients and 29 control subjects cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed. From four￾chamber cine imaging, RV transverse motion was quantified as the change of the septum-free-wall (SF) distance 
between end-diastole and end-systole at seven levels along an apex-to-base axis. For each level, regional absolute and 
fractional transverse distance change (SFD and fractional-SFD) were computed and related to RVEF. Longitudinal 
measures, including TAPSE and fractional tricuspid-annulus-apex distance change (fractional-TAAD) were evaluated for 
comparison.
Results: Transverse wall motion was significantly reduced at all levels compared to control subjects (p < 0.001). For all 
levels, fractional-SFD and SFD were related to RVEF, with the strongest relation at mid RV (R2 = 0.70, p < 0.001 and R2 = 
0.62, p < 0.001). For TAPSE and fractional-TAAD, weaker relations with RVEF were found (R2 = 0.21, p < 0.001 and R2 = 
0.27, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Regional transverse wall movements provide important information of RV function in PH. Compared to 
longitudinal motion, transverse motion at mid RV reveals a significantly stronger relationship with RVEF and thereby 
might be a better predictor for RV function.
Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by
increased pulmonary pressure, leading to right ventricu￾lar (RV) overload. The course of the illness varies from
patient to patient, with the worst prognosis seen in
patients with the greatest degree of RV dysfunction [1,2].
This highlights the importance of knowledge of RV func￾tion for the determination of prognosis and therapy strat￾egies.
In general, RV ejection fraction (RVEF) is assumed to
be a major determinant of systolic RV function, and has
been shown to be of prognostic value in PH [3,4]. How￾ever, determining RVEF is time consuming and depends
on geometric assumptions, and this has limited the appli￾cation in clinical practice [5,6]. A simpler approach is to
approximate RVEF by measuring the tricuspid annular
plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). This measure quanti￾fies the longitudinal shortening of the RV and its clinical
value has been well established by echocardiography [7-
10]. It has also recently been applied using cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) [11].
Less attention has been paid to RV transverse wall
motion in the literature [12-14], despite the fact that

transverse movements of the RV free wall towards the
septum are important in RV ejection (bellows action)
[12,15,16].
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to measure
RV transverse motion in PH and to assess its relationship
with RVEF employing CMR. Longitudinal RV motion
measurements were included for comparison purposes.
Results in PH patients were compared to control subjects.
Materials and methods
Patients and control subjects
The local Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical
Center approved the study protocol and all participants
gave written informed consent. Between September 2004
and September 2008, 658 patients were referred to our
hospital for evaluation of PH. PH was diagnosed accord￾ing to a standard protocol [17], including right heart cath￾eterization (RHC), and was confirmed when the mean
pulmonary artery pressure at rest was >25 mmHg and the
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was < 15 mmHg.
Inclusion criteria were: patients with PH with etiologies
from WHO group 1 (pulmonary arterial hypertension) or
group 4 (chronic thrombotic or embolic disease), and
who had undergone CMR within 14 days after RHC had
been performed. In total 123 patients met these criteria.
Of this group, 15 patients were excluded because some
CMR cines were lacking and 7 patients due to technically
inadequate images. Thus, in total 101 patients were
included in the study. In addition, a total of 29 healthy
non-smoking, age and gender matched control subjects
were included as a reference group. These healthy sub￾jects had had no RHC.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
In a subset of patients (n = 66), cardiopulmonary exercise
testing was performed on an electromagnetically braked
cycle ergometer (Rehcor, Lode Groningen, The Nether￾lands). A progressive increase in pedaling workload (5-20
W/min) was applied until maximum tolerance was
reached. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2,peak) was con￾sidered to express the patient's exercise capacity, which
was measured using a metabolic cart (Vmax 229; Viasys,
Yorba Linda, CA). To ensure accuracy, the measurements
were time-averaged over a minimum of 20 seconds. The
equipment was calibrated according the manufacturer's
specifications.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
CMR was performed by means of a 1.5T Siemens Avanto
MRI system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany),
equipped with a 6-element phased-array coil. ECG-gated
cine imaging was performed using a balanced steady￾state free precession pulse sequence, during repeated
breath-holds. Long-axis slices were acquired in the four,
three and two-chamber views.
The four-chamber image plane was localized by the fol￾lowing steps: a basal short-axis image at end-diastole was
used as the first localizer. Orthogonal to this short-axis
image, the four-chamber view was obtained by rotating
the planning line to such an orientation that it passes
through the middle of the mitral and tricuspid valvular
rings. The LV vertical long-axis view was used as the sec￾ond localizer, to assure that the planned four-chamber
cine passes through the most apical point of the LV cav￾ity.
Additionally, short-axis slices were obtained with a typ￾ical slice thickness of 5 mm and an interslice gap of 5 mm,
fully covering both ventricles from base to apex. The MR
parameters used were: temporal resolution between 35 to
45 ms, voxel size 1.5 × 1.8 × 5.0 mm3, flip angle 60°,
receiver bandwidth 930 Hz/pixel, TR/TE 3.2/1.6 ms,
matrix 256 × 156.
Image analysis
An apical four-chamber view was used to analyze longi￾tudinal and transverse movements of the RV myocardium
(Figure 1). The software for the analysis was implemented
in MATLAB release R2008a (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, United States).
Transverse measures
Transverse RV movements were analyzed using a method
that quantifies regional changes from septum to free-wall
(SF) between end-diastole and end-systole. First, lines
were drawn between the right-lateral point of the tricus￾pid annulus and the apex, and between the left-lateral
point of the mitral annulus and the apex. Then, the line
intersecting the centers of the left and right lateral annu￾lus-apex lines was drawn (Figure 1), both in end-diastole
and in end-systole. SF dimensions were considered paral￾lel to the intersecting line. The advantage of this approach
is that clear markers are used to determine the geometric
orientation of the SF dimensions. Next, contours were
carefully drawn within the compact layer but outside the
trabeculated layer of the RV myocardium. If at end-sys￾tole the interstices between hypertrophied trabeculae
were no longer visible the corresponding boundary line
was estimated after careful observation in cine mode.
Subsequently, SF dimensions were computed at seven
different levels covering the whole RV cavity, indicated as
apex-1 through base-7, with level mid-4 exactly halfway
through the RV. For each level, the absolute SF distance
change (SFD) was determined, and the fractional SF dis￾tance change (fractional-SFD) was then computed as SFD
divided by the SF dimension at end-diastole.
End-diastole was defined as the onset of the R-wave in
the ECG. End-systole was determined visually as the
moment of end-shortening of the RV free wall. This defi￾nition of end-systole was applied because a time delay
often exists between pulmonary valve closure and end￾shortening in PH. In this situation leftward septal bowing

is observed, where RV end-shortening coincides with
maximum bowing[18].
Longitudinal measures
Longitudinal RV movements were quantified as modified
TAPSE, adapted from echocardiography [11]. CMR
TAPSE was computed as the absolute distance change
between end-diastole and end-systole of the tricuspid
annulus-apex dimension. Fractional tricuspid annulus￾apex distance change (fractional-TAAD) was calculated
as TAPSE divided by the tricuspid annulus-apex dimen￾sion at end-diastole.
Area change
RV area change in 4-chamber view was quantified from
the endocardial contours at end-diastole and end-systole.
Fractional area change (FAC) was calculated as the abso￾lute area change divided by the end-diastolic area.
RVEF
Endocardial surfaces were carefully manually traced from
the stack of short-axis cine images, using Mass Analysis
software (MEDIS Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, The
Netherlands) to obtain RV end-diastolic and end-systolic
volumes. Trabeculae and papillary muscles were excluded
from these measurements. The RV end-systolic image
was identified by selecting the smallest ventricular sur￾face. Based on these volumes, RVEF and stroke volume
were calculated.
Statistics
Normal distribution of the data was verified using a nor￾mal probability plot and log transformed if necessary. All
data are presented as mean ± SD, unless stated otherwise.
A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Data between controls and patients were compared using
the 2-tailed Students t-test for unpaired data or using
one-way ANOVA when more than two groups were
tested. The Fisher exact test was used for categorical data.
Linear regression was performed to test the relationships
between the transverse measures (SFD and fractional￾SFD) and RVEF, and between the longitudinal measures
(TAPSE and fractional-TAAD) and RVEF. In the regres￾Figure 1 Four-chamber and short axis views of a healthy subject, a patient with moderate PH and a patient with severe PH. The figure illus￾trates how the longitudinal dimension (from tricuspid annulus to apex (TA)) and transverse dimensions (from septum to free-wall (SF)) are determined. 
Firstly, both in end-diastole and end-systole, the left and right lateral annulus-apex lines were drawn. Secondly, the intersection through the centres 
of these lines was drawn. SF dimensions were considered parallel to this intersecting line. Thirdly, RV endocardial contours were drawn to determine 
the SF dimension at seven different levels covering the whole RV (indicated as apex-1 through base-7, with level mid-4 exactly halfway through the 
RV). The white lines in the short axis views indicate the intersections of the four-chamber views. RV = right ventricle, RA = right atrium, LV = left ven￾tricle, LA = left atrium, A = Apex, T = lateral tricuspid annulus, S = RV endocardial septum, F = RV endocardial free wall.

sion analysis only patients were included in order to avoid
regression bias by the control group.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was
used to test sensitivity and specificity of all measures to
detect a RVEF less than the median RVEF value in
patients. To correct for multiple testing, the threshold for
significance was adjusted using Bonferroni correction for
families of tests with 0.05 divided by the amount of tests
giving the adjusted threshold for significance.
Intra-observer and inter-observer variability of the
endocardial wall measurements were assessed using the
analysis of agreement method described by Bland and
Altman [19]. To this end, the same observer repeated
CMR measurements of 10 patients and 10 control sub￾jects within a period of one month to determine the
intra-observer variability. A second observer repeated the
same measurements to obtain the inter-observer variabil￾ity.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Sta￾tistics 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, United States).
Results
Characteristics of the study population
There was no difference between the 101 PH patients and
29 control subjects with respect to age (PH = 50 ± 15
years vs. control = 46 ± 19 years, p = 0.082) and gender
(PH = 68% female vs. control = 67% female, p = 0.35).
Table 1 summarizes the clinical and hemodynamic char￾acteristics of the PH patients. Most patients were from
WHO group 1 (80%), with the remainder being from
group 4 (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hyperten￾sion). Approximately 60% of all patients were medically
treated for PH at enrollment, and many of them went
through one or more regimens.
Baseline CMR measurements of PH patients and con￾trol subjects are presented in Table 2. Values of RVEF
were significantly different between the groups, but no
significant differences were found for LVEF. However,
there was a significant difference for LVEDV between the
two groups.

of a healthy subject and two patients with moderate or
severe PH.
Comparison of RV regional wall motion between patients 
and controls
Figure 2 shows results of fractional-SFD, evaluated for
seven levels ranging from apex to base, and fractional￾TAAD in patients and controls. In PH patients, virtually
no regional variation in fractional-SFD was found. In
contrast, control subjects showed the highest fractional￾SFD at the apical segment, and the lowest at the basal seg￾ment. At all levels, there were significant differences in
transverse movements between patients and control sub￾Table 1: Clinical characteristics and hemodynamics of PH

jects (Table 3). From Table 3 it can be seen that for all
subjects, SFD values are consistently smaller than TAPSE,
but that this does not hold for fractional-SFD compared
to fractional-TAAD due to the shorter end-diastolic
transverse dimension (SF) compared to the longitudinal
dimension (TAA).
No significant differences were found in longitudinal
and transverse motion between the patients from WHO
group 1 and 4 (data not shown).
RV wall motion with reference to RV ejection fraction and 
exercise capacity
Fractional-SFD was correlated positively with RVEF at
each level of the RV free wall (Table 4), but the strongest
correlations were found at level 4 (mid-level; R2 = 0.70, p
< 0.001; Figure 3) and level 5 (R2 = 0.66, p < 0.001).
Weaker relationships were found for SFD, fractional￾TAAD and TAPSE (Figure 3 and Table 4).
Figure 4 and Table 5 show the results of ROC-analysis,
indicating that fractional-SFD at mid RV is a sensitive and
specific indicator of depressed RVEF below the median
value in patients (< 35%, range 10-61%, range control sub￾jects: 41-77%). Compared to fractional-SFD, there were
statistically significant differences among the areas under
the curves for SFD (p = 0.005), fractional-TAAD (p =
0.003) and TAPSE (p < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.
In a subset of patients (n = 66) exercise capacity was
measured using VO2,peak and VO2,peak-predicted (Table 1).
Figure 5 illustrates VO2,peak-predicted below and above
the median value (44%, range: 10-110%) in comparison
with fractional-SFD and fractional-TAAD. A significant
difference was found for fractional-SFD (p = 0.002) but
not for fractional-TAAD.
Variability
Figure 6 shows the intra- and inter-observer variability
using Bland-Altman plots. The intra- and inter-observer
variability for all longitudinal and transverse measures
was not statistically significant.
Discussion
We have evaluated regional transverse motion of the RV
myocardium, defined as movements of the RV free-wall
to the septum, in a group of PH patients and control sub￾jects. The most important finding of this study was that
RVEF was more closely related to fractional transverse
movements than to longitudinal movements. The former
might consequently be used as an alternative measure of
RV pump function. In addition, we observed that frac￾tional transverse movements in control subjects were
largest near the apex, but smaller near the base of the

heart, while PH patients showed consistently smaller
movements and little regional variation.
RV ejection fraction
A significant relationship between fractional-SFD and
RVEF was found for all levels, with the strongest relation
at mid RV level (R2 = 0.70, p < 0.001). The relationship
between TAPSE and RVEF, however, was much lower (R2
= 0.21, p < 0.001). Although this value corresponds to
what was found by Kjaergaard et al. [20] (R2 = 0.23), other
studies have reported higher correlations (R2 > 0.38)

[10,11]. This difference might be explained by the inclu￾sion of control subjects in their regression analysis.
From a practical perspective, the measurement of frac￾tional-SFD appears clinical useful. A cutoff value of 17.7%
was used to differentiate between patients with a low (<
35%) or preserved (>35%) RVEF (sensitivity of 84.2%;
specificity of 88.1%), which had a significantly higher dis￾criminatory power compared to SFD, fractional-TAAD
or TAPSE (Figure 4; Table 5). Because RVEF is of prog￾nostic importance [3,4] and our results showed that frac￾tional-SFD has a high predictive value for RVEF,
fractional-SFD might be useful in clinical practice.
Functional considerations
The importance of transverse wall movements in ejection
was first acknowledged by Rushmer et al. [15]. They
described that although longitudinal movements are eas￾ily identified, they are probably much less important for
ejection than compression of the RV chamber by move￾ment of the free wall toward the septum (bellows action).
However, only a few studies have been performed on
(regional) RV transverse wall motion and its contribution
to RV function [12-14,21,22] and none of these were per￾formed in PH. Moreover, while some reports examined
transverse movements just below the tricuspid valve
[21,22], our results, in PH, showed that loss of transverse
motion at this level was lower compared to the other
regions (Figure 2; Table 3). Evidence for a hypokinetic
apex in PH was shown earlier by strain analysis employed
by tissue Doppler echocardiography [23-25]. However,
this has not been observed using MR myocardial tagging
[26].
Considering the transverse measures at mid RV a
remarkably large difference exists between PH patients
and control subjects (figure 2 and table 3). Moreover, this
difference is much larger than is found for the longitudi￾nal measures. To be able to explain these results accu￾rately, the definitions of the measures need to be
considered in more detail.
SFD is defined as the difference between end-diastolic
and end-systolic SF dimension, and thereby quantifies
disturbances of RV free-wall movements. Additionally,
paradoxical leftward septal bowing increases the end-sys￾tolic SF dimensions and, as a consequence, also affects
SFD. Thus, especially in severe patients the existence of a
septal bowing may contribute to the large differences
seen between patients and controls.
Fractional-SFD is defined as SFD divided by the end￾diastolic SF dimension. The unusually high end-systolic
pressure in the lumen of the RV in patients with PH
affects the cross-sectional shape of the cavity. Whereas it
normally tends to be crescent shaped in cross section, it
adopts a more circular cross section when contracting
against pressure that approaches or exceeds that of the
left ventricle (Figure 1). This alteration of geometry
mainly affects transverse rather than longitudinal dimen￾sions, and therefore contributes more to reduction of
fractional-SFD rather than fractional-TAAD. In addition
to any impairment of RV myocardial contractility, this
"transverse" dilation may contribute to the large differ￾ence between PH patients and controls.
Anatomical considerations
Despite several anatomical studies, the relationship
between fiber orientation and right-heart mechanics is
still not completely clear [27,28]. Presently, there is
increasing consensus that both the septum and RV free
wall play an important role in RV contraction. The sep￾tum consists of oblique longitudinal fibers with spiral

architecture [29], resulting in the twisting motion
required for efficient ejection against increased vascular
resistance. In contrast, the predominant transverse fiber
orientation of the RV free wall leads to circumferential
compression or bellows action, which maintains RVEF
with normal pulmonary artery pressure [28,30,31].
In the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, it has been
shown that the fiber orientation of the septum becomes
more transverse [30]. An altered fiber orientation in the
RV free wall is also likely to occur as the RV dilates. This
dilation is profound toward the apical segments and
results in an increased apical angle (Figure 1) [32].
Changes in fiber direction in the free wall are supported
by a study of Pettersen et al. [33] in which MR strain anal￾ysis was applied to patients with a systemic RV. There
results indicated a predominant circumferential over lon￾gitudinal free wall shortening at mid RV, while the reverse
has been observed in healthy control subjects [33,34].
Therefore, we hypothesize that disturbed RV wall
motion in PH can be explained by impaired RV myocar￾dial contractility due to altered fiber orientation. How￾ever, further studies are needed to explain how changes of
fiber geometry contribute to both longitudinal and trans￾verse wall motion.

Practical implications
RV function is the primary determinant of prognosis in
PH. Therefore, clinicians need simple and reproducible
tests to assess RV function in order to improve their man￾agement of PH. In general, RVEF is assumed to be a
major determinant of systolic RV function. However, its
determination is time consuming and is limited by large
inter and intra-observer variability. TAPSE has been
shown to correlate with RVEF and has been considered a
simple method for semi-quantitative assessment of RV
function. In this study we have showed that fractional￾SFD around mid RV level is more strongly correlated with
RVEF. Since SF dimension around mid level is as simple
to measure as TAPSE (only two points are needed), it is
an easy and accurate way to assess RV function with
CMR. The clinical value of the transverse measures
would be even stronger if these could be measured using
echocardiography. This should be investigated in future
research.
Limitations
Some limitations of the current study should be noted.
Firstly, geometry and heavily trabeculated myocardium of
the RV make it sensitive to errors in the determination of
endocardial definition. Secondly, four-chamber views
were acquired with equal geometric orientation at end￾diastole and end-systole, without accounting for through
plane motion. It is unknown whether RV torsion may
affect the end-systolic dimension. A previous study
reported regional differences in rotation in the systemic
RV. However, when values were averaged over different
segments, this resulted in almost absent rotation at the
basal and the apical level with no absolute global ventric￾ular torsion [35].
Conclusions
In PH, transverse myocardial motion is significantly
declined. Moreover, measures of transverse movement at
mid RV reveal a significant relationship with RVEF, which
is much stronger than for measures of longitudinal move￾ment. Since fractional-SFD at mid level is as feasible and
reliable to measure as TAPSE, it might be a better predic￾tor of RV function in PH. Further studies are needed to
evaluate the usefulness in clinical practice.
