Abstract
Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with a
poor prognosis in diffuse lung disease (DLD). A study was
undertaken to compare the prognostic significance of invasive and
non-invasive parameters in patients with DLD and suspected PH.
Methods: Hospital records of consecutive patients with DLD
undergoing right heart catheterisation (RHC) were reviewed (n = 
66). Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) and non-invasive variables were examined against
early (within 12 months) and overall mortality. A priori thresholds
were examined against early mortality. Relationships between
mPAP, PVR and non-invasive markers were assessed.
Results: Fifty patients had PH on RHC (mean (SD) mPAP 33.5
(11.8) mm Hg, PVR 5.9 (4.3) Wood units (WU)). Raised PVR was
strongly associated with early mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.30; 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.52; p = 0.001), with PVR ⩾6.23
WU being the optimal threshold after adjustment for age, gender,
composite physiological index (CPI) and diagnosis of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (OR 11.09; 95% CI 2.54 to 48.36; p = 0.001).
Early mortality was linked, albeit less strongly, to right ventricular
dilation at echocardiography, but not to other non-invasive
variables or mPAP. Overall mortality was most strongly associated
with increasing CPI levels. Correlations between PVR and non-
invasive variables were moderate (R2 <0.32), improving little
following construction of a multivariate index which did not itself
predict mortality.
Conclusion: In severe DLD, early mortality is strongly linked to


increased PVR but not to other RHC or non-invasive variables.
These findings suggest that the threshold for RHC in severe DLD
should be low, enabling prioritisation of aggressive treatment
including lung transplantation.
