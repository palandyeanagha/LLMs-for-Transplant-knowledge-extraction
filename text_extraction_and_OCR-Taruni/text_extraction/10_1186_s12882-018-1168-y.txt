Abstract
Background: Bordetella pertussis infection is a known trigger of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). For
patients suspected of having atypical HUS, prompt plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI) or eculizumab (ECZ) treatment
is recommended.
Case presentation: We report a 1-month-old female infant who was admitted with a severe cough and a B.
pertussis-positive sputum culture. She was born at 38 weeks gestation and did not have a family history of renal
diseases. Hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected and she was transferred to our hospital 17 days after her initial
admission. One day later, she developed acute kidney injury and was diagnosed with HUS triggered by B. pertussis
infection. Her plasma complement levels were low and her kidney function continued to worsen over the next few
days. However, prior to starting ECZ treatment, her kidney function improved spontaneously; she did not receive
PE/PI or ECZ. She was discharged 46 days after her initial hospitalization, without complications. A genetic workup
revealed no mutations in CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, MCP, THBD, or DGKE.
Conclusions: This case demonstrates that B. pertussis infection-related HUS may resolve spontaneously. The decision
to treat during the acute phase is challenging because B. pertussis often affects infants suspected of having atypical
HUS. However, ECZ may not be the first treatment option for patients with B. pertussis infection-related HUS unless
they show an indicated genetic abnormality; if ECZ is used, early discontinuation should be considered.

Background
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) includes clinical con￾ditions that present as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and organ injury [1]. Generally, TMA
syndromes are extraordinarily diverse and may include
thrombocytopenic purpura, Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), complement-mediated HUS (also
known as atypical HUS [aHUS]), and other manifestations
secondary to an infection, drug, or underlying disease.
Pertussis infection has been a known trigger of aHUS
since the initial report of fatal HUS following a pertussis
infection in a patient with a suspected factor H mutation
[2, 3]. Therefore, in patients with HUS secondary to a
Bordetella pertussis infection, plasma exchange/infusion
(PE/PI) was conducted in most cases during the acute
phase because of the possibility of aHUS [4]. Recently,
when aHUS has been clinically diagnosed in children,
especially in infants, the administration of eculizumab
(ECZ), rather than PE/PI, has been considered the
first-line treatment [5, 6].
Herein, we report the case of a 1-month-old female in￾fant, with a B. pertussis infection, who developed HUS.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient

whose symptoms resolved, without any complications,
and who remained in remission without receiving
plasma therapy or ECZ treatment.
Case presentation
A 1-month-old Japanese girl, born at 38 weeks gestation
with a normal birth weight (2870 g) and no family his￾tory of TMA or kidney disease, was examined at a hos￾pital due to a 2-day history of cough. She was admitted
3 days later because B. pertussis was detected in her
nasopharyngeal culture. She was treated with oxygen
supplementation, antibiotics (piperacillin), and broncho￾dilators; her bacterial infection was complicated by a re￾spiratory syncytial virus (RSV) superinfection. Fourteen
days after admission, her laboratory evaluation revealed
anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogen￾ase (LDH) levels (up to 4,428 IU/L), and markedly
increased serum ferritin concentrations (up to 26,208
ng/mL) (Fig. 1). Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) was
suspected, and treated with steroids and gamma
globulin.
She was transferred to our hospital 17 days after her
initial admission, and the HPS diagnosis was excluded
following a bone marrow analysis. The patient’s plasma
complement levels were low (C3, 59 mg/dL; C4, 11 mg/
dL; CH50, 31.0 U/mL) and a urinalysis showed
hematuria and proteinuria; her kidney function wors￾ened over the next few days (creatinine, up to 0.58 mg/
dL). Her ADAMTS13 level was normal, but her hapto￾globin level was significantly below normal and
schistocytes were found in a peripheral blood smear. As
a result, we diagnosed her with HUS caused by B. per￾tussis infection.
During our preparation to initiate ECZ treatment, her
LDH levels started decreasing. Thereafter, her creatinine
level decreased and her condition improved spontan￾eously. Hence, we did not perform PE/PI or administer
ECZ. The C3 level increased to within normal limits
(115 mg/dL). She was discharged 46 days after her first
hospitalization, without any complications, and
remained in remission 3 years later. A genetic workup
was performed to examine for potential complement
regulator mutations; however, no mutation was found in
CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, MCP, THBD, or DGKE.
Discussion and conclusions
Was our case an aHUS triggered by pertussis infection
or a secondary TMA due to pertussis infection? It is very
difficult to make a decision; however, we consider that
this patient is more likely to have had a secondary TMA
rather than an aHUS based on the following reasons.
First, the HUS of our patient showed spontaneous
remission without PE/PI or ECZ treatment. Second, a
specific genetic mutation related to complement regula￾tion was not identified. Third, past reports do not de￾scribe recurrent HUS after the first episode and our
patient did not experience HUS recurrence within 3
years after achieving remission (Table 1).
B. pertussis infection-associated HUS was first re￾ported by Berner et al., who suspected a patient of

having a CFH mutation; the patient had a fatal out￾come [3]. Therefore, treatment with PI/PE or ECZ
has been performed for most reported cases with B.
pertussis-related HUS (Table 1). Hence, we are unsure
whether these reported patients survived due to
treatment-related benefits or due to spontaneous re￾covery. To our knowledge, ours is the first reported
case of suspected aHUS to show a spontaneous re￾covery, suggesting that HUS secondary to a pertussis
infection is actually a secondary TMA. If all patients
with potential aHUS receive PI/PE or ECZ treatment,
they would probably recover. However, such treat￾ment may be unnecessary for patients with a second￾ary TMA. Regardless, according to a recent report,
immediate (within 24–48 h) administration of ECZ is
recommended, especially for pediatric patients sus￾pected of having aHUS [5]. A definite understanding
of the clinical presentation of HUS following a per￾tussis infection, and the judicious use of ECZ, is ne￾cessary to avoid unnecessary treatment.
On the other hand, the contribution of complement
system dysregulation cannot be completely ruled out in
our patient. Even though genetic mutations were not
identified, such genetic mutations remain undetected in
30–40% of patients with aHUS [2]. The spontaneous re￾mission of our patient may be due to the effect of the
steroid used to treat respiratory symptoms and
suspected HPS, prior to her transfer to our hospital. The
patient showed decreased levels of both C3 and C4 in
the acute phase. Theoretically, aHUS is characterized by
abnormalities in the alternative complement pathway
and may be identified by a selective C3 deficiency, with
normal C4 levels [9]. Conversely, complement levels in
secondary TMA are considered to be variable due to its
association with a variety of causative diseases. The low
complement levels in this patient did not contradict past
reports indicating that B. pertussis infections induce acti￾vation of the classical complement pathway [7].
The pathogenetic triggers of complement activation in￾clude immunologic disorders, genetics, infections, systemic
diseases, drug administration, and mixed-cause triggers. In
Japan, the revised diagnostic criteria for aHUS developed in
2015 by the Japanese Society of Nephrology and the Japan
Pediatric Society excluded secondary TMA from the aHUS
definition, according to the international consensus [8–10].
Additionally, this new clinical guideline recommends thera￾peutic treatments, such as ECZ administration or plasma
therapy, for patients with aHUS, but not for those with a
secondary TMA [8]. Typically, aHUS can be distinguished
from other TMAs. However, this may be challenging in the
acute phase of HUS onset because pertussis often affects
infants < 3-months-old, before they are eligible for
post-natal pertussis vaccination. Our case suggests that
some cases of HUS following pertussis infection may be

secondary TMAs. Conversely, we cannot completely ex￾clude the contribution of an undetected complement regu￾lator abnormality. Determining the appropriate treatment
course during the acute phase remains challenging. Clini￾cians should plan treatments of their patients according to
the clinical courses.
In conclusion, B. pertussis infection could be a cause
of secondary TMA, not an aHUS. ECZ administration
or PE/PI may not always be the first treatment option
for pediatric patients with HUS secondary to a B. pertus￾sis infection. If such treatments are used, their early dis￾continuation should also be considered.
