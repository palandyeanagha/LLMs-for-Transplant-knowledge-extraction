Abstract
The epidemiology of severe acute renal failure has dramatically
changed in the past decade. Its leading cause is sepsis and the
syndrome develops mostly in the intensive care unit as part of
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. After the significant improve￾ments obtained from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s, the past
decade has seen a dramatic evolution in technology leading to new
machines and new techniques for renal and multiple organ support.
Extracorporeal therapies are now performed using adequate
treatment doses, which have resulted in improved survival in the
general population. At the same time, patients with sepsis seem to
benefit from the use of increased doses, as in the case of high￾volume hemofiltration or of increased membrane permeability and
sorbents as in the case of continuous plasmafiltration adsorption.
The humoral theory of sepsis and the peak concentration
hypothesis have spurred a significant interest in the use of such
extracorporeal therapies for renal support and possibly for the
therapy of sepsis. Ongoing research and prospective studies will
further elucidate the role of such therapies in this setting.
In the past decade, the change in the epidemiology of acute
renal failure has made critical care nephrology an emerging
sub-speciality of intensive care medicine. Dedicated literature
and a series of physicians and nurses have made an effort to
bridge the knowledge and experience from nephrology and
critical care medicine in response to an increased incidence
of acute kidney injury in intensive care unit (ICU) patients [1].
The origin of this process can definitely be found in the mid
1970s, when continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH)
appeared on the scene. CAVH has been a tool that has
permitted the treatment of patients with acute kidney injury in
which peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis were clinically or
technically precluded [2]. This opened the doors of ICUs to a
dedicated dialysis technology that experienced a flourishing
evolution in subsequent years. Within a few years, continuous
veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) replaced CAVH because
of its improved performance and safety. The advance was
made possible by the use of blood pumps, calibrated
ultrafiltration control systems and double lumen venous
catheters. In the late 1980s, specific machines for continuous
renal replacement therapies (CRRTs) were designed and a
new era of renal replacement in the critically ill patient began
[3]. The therapy started to be standardized and clear
indications began to be defined.
The evolution of technology did not stop, however, and the
recent demand for higher efficiency and exchange volumes
has spurred new interest in a further generation of machines
with better performance, integrated information technology
and easy to use operator interfaces. An example of such
technological evolution is represented by the passage from
CAVH systems to the BSM 22 and Prisma machines to the
most recently developed Prismaflex machine (Gambro Dasco,
Mirandola, Italy; Fig. 1). A schematic drawing of different
techniques available today for the therapy of the critically ill
patient with renal and other organ dysfunction is given in
Fig. 2. The last generation of machines available on the
market today and representing the evolution of the past
decade of research and development is shown in Fig. 3.
Two interesting aspects of the evolution of renal replacement
therapy (RRT) in the ICU over the past decade are
represented by the definition of an ‘adequate’ dose of dialysis
in acute kidney injury and the potential of high dose therapies
for the treatment of sepsis [4]. The first of these has identified
35 ml/kg/h as a dose of dialysis capable of improving survival,
whereas higher doses do not seem to give additional benefits
in the general population [4]. The second concept introduces
the rationale for high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) in patients
with acute renal failure and sepsis [5]. In this setting, the
most important advance of the past decade has been the use
of either increased exchange volumes in hemofiltration, or the
combined use of adsorbent techniques in systems where the

cut-off of the membrane was increased to the level commonly
seen in membranes for plasmafiltration [6]. HVHF is a variant
of CVVH that requires higher surface area hemofilters and
employs ultrafiltration volumes of 35 to 80 ml/kg/h.
This technique is associated with practical problems,
including the requirement of adequate hardware, significant
amounts of re-infusion fluid and monitoring systems accurate
enough for the high volumes exchanged and the relatively
high blood flows used.
In the past five years, many studies have been conducted to
evaluate and demonstrate benefits of increasing the volume
of ultrafiltration and replacement fluid during CRRT [7,8],
particularly in complex and very severe syndromes such as
severe sepsis and septic shock, associated or not with acute
renal failure.
In general, the high-volume approach provides higher
clearances for middle/high molecular weight solutes than a
simple diffusive transport (CVVHD) or a convection-based
transport at lower volumes (CVVH). These solutes seem to
be primarily involved in the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome, which characterizes the sepsis syndrome, and
their efficient removal may thus be beneficial [9].
Alternative approaches have been based on more efficient
removal of inflammatory mediators by high cut-off hemofilters,
which are characterized by an increased effective pore size.
Most commercially available hemofilters do not permit a
substantial elimination of cytokines because of the low cut-off
point of their membranes. The use of high cut-off hemofilters
is a new and effective approach to cytokine removal, but it
has potentially harmful side effects, such as the loss of
essential proteins like albumin [10]. To prevent this side
effect, plasmafiltration coupled with adsorption (CPFA) has
been designed and experimentally used with beneficial
effects in septic patients [11]. CPFA is a combined therapy in
which plasma is separated from blood and circulated through
a sorbent bed. After this purification phase, blood is
reconstituted and dialyzed with standard techniques. The final
effect is an increased removal of protein bound solutes and
large molecular weight toxins.
These therapies are not selective in removing specific
mediators (pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators are equally
removed) and, consequently, their role is not completely
understood and their usefulness remains the subject of much
debate. Early data are encouraging but additional data are
required before they could become part of the standard
management of sepsis. More statistically powered studies are

needed to confirm the preliminary results on the positive
effect of HVHF and CPFA on outcome. Except for the
beneficial effect of dialysis dose, no randomised trial has
evaluated the effect of HVHF on clinical outcome, or the
effect of different modalities of CRRT on length of stay and
recovery of renal function in patients with sepsis. This
research is needed. Adequate technical support becomes
mandatory, therefore, to fulfil all these expectations. The
evolution of understanding of the above mentioned concepts
has led to the improvement of technology and the generation
of new machines and devices compatible with the demand
for increased efficiency, accuracy, safety, performance and
cost/benefit ratio.
At present, almost all CRRT therapies can be delivered in a
safe, adequate and flexible way, thanks to devices specifically
designed for critically ill patients to a point that multiple organ
support therapy is envisaged as a possible therapeutic
approach in the critical care setting [12].
HVHF or CPFA can be seen as a potent powerful immuno￾modulatory treatment in sepsis. Since sepsis and systemic
inflammatory response syndrome are characterized by a
cytokine network that is synergistic, redundant, autocatalytic
and self-augmenting, the control of such a non-linear system
can not be approached by simple blockade or elimination of
some specific mediators. Therefore, non-specific removal of a
broad range of inflammatory mediators by HVHF and CPFA
may be beneficial, as recently suggested on the basis of the
‘peak concentration’ hypothesis [9].
The high dose that characterizes HVHF can be delivered
either using a constantly high exchange rate or by delivering a
‘pulse’ (for 6 to 8 h) of very high-volume hemofiltration (85 to

100 ml/kg/h) followed by standard doses [13]. In both cases,
cytokine half-lives and concentrations are affected, the first by
the continuous modality and the second by the non-specific
decapitation of peaks. Therefore, rather than a detailed
analysis of each molecule involved, we envisage as much
more interesting and useful a teleological analysis of the
impact of HVHF on more integrated events such as monocyte
cell responsiveness, including apoptosis, neutrophil priming
activity and oxidative burst [14-16]. More studies are needed
to define its role in hyperdynamic septic shock, with or
without acute renal failure. A last comment should be
dedicated to the use of sorbents and especially those
cartridges dedicated to the adsorption of endotoxin and
related material. A great deal of evolution has occurred in this
field but it seems we are only at the beginning of a long and
possibly fruitful journey [16].
At the end of this commentary we might speculate that
although improvements have been made, a lot remains to be
done. For sure, the progress of technology in critical care
nephrology has been enormous and more will come in the
near future.
