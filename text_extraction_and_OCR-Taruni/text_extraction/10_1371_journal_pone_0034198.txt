Abstract
Background: The coexistence of HBV infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) becomes characteristic of liver
disease in China, with unknown bilateral influence. We aimed to investigate the effect of hepatic steatosis, a common
hepatocyte change in NAFLD, on antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
Methods and Findings: We carried out a prospective nested case control study in CHB patients receiving Entecavir for initial
antiviral therapy, by recording demographic, anthropometric and clinical data at baseline, 24wk, 48wk and 96wk. Univariate
analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied to find out independent factors of hepatic steatosis and Entecavir
treatment failure. The rates of HBV-DNA clearance, HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalization were compared between
CHB patients with and without steatosis by post hoc analysis. A total of 267 Chinese patients with CHB entered final
analysis, with overall percentages of hepatic steatosis and HBeAg positive as 30.5% and 62.4%. Multivariate analysis showed
waist circumference, serum TG and uric acid levels were independent factors of hepatic steatosis. The response rates to
Entecavir were 54.9%, 63.8%, 74.2% at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk. Hepatic steatosis was revealed as an independent factor of
Entecavir treatment failure by multivariate logistic regression at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk. In CHB patients with hepatic steatosis,
HBV-DNA clearance and HBeAg seroconversion were both lower throughout the follow-up, but only the former reached
statistical significance. Besides, ALT normalization was also significantly lower at 24wk and 48wk.
Conclusion: Hepatic steatosis is significantly associated with Entecavir treatment failure and metabolic factors are
independent factors of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, which called for a specified antiviral strategy in CHB patients with
NAFLD.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects over 350 million people
worldwide while countries in Asia and Africa account for over
70% of chronic HBV infection, with prevalence up to 15%–20%
[1,2]. In China, it was estimated that at least 10% of the general
population are chronically infected with HBV, which becomes the
most common cause of liver diseases [3]. Though the efficacy of
antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has been greatly
improved in the last decades after discovery of interferon and
nucleoside analogues, lack of response still remains common [4]. It
is well recognized that uncontrolled virus replication can cause
liver damage and predispose those nonresponders into liver
diseases of advanced stage. Therefore, unraveling factors associ￾ated with treatment failure in CHB patients is of clinical
importance.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as a
common clinico- pathologic condition characterized by lipid
deposition with/without inflammation in hepatocytes and com￾prises a wide spectrum of liver damage, including simple steatosis,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis [5]. With social
development and lifestyle change, NAFLD has now become a
major cause of liver related morbidity and mortality, with the
incidence of around 20% worldwide [6] and 15% in China [7].
Therefore, the coexistence of HBV infection and NAFLD
becomes a novel characteristic of liver disease in China. However,
their bilateral influence in both disease development and
therapeutic response has been rarely reported.
Hepatic steatosis has long been considered as a common
hepatocellular change in both simple steatosis and NASH.
Recently, accumulated evidence showed that the frequency of
hepatic steatosis in CHB patients ranged from 27% to 51%, higher
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e34198

than that in the general population, hinting its potential effects in
CHB [8]. Moreover, steatosis in CHB patients seems to be a result
of metabolic factors of the host rather than the effect of virus
[9,10]. Nevertheless, the effect of hepatic steatosis on treatment
response in CHB patients is largely unknown. Therefore, we
prospectively investigated, in an unmatched nested case control
study of CHB patents receiving initial Entecavir therapy, the
frequency of steatosis, its association with host and viral factors
and its impact on the response to antiviral therapy.
Methods
Ethics statement
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at
Zhejiang University and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study design and manuscript
preparation fully followed guideline from the STROBE statement
[11]. All written informed consent was collected.
Protocol
We have prospectively enrolled a cohort of CHB patients
receiving Entecavir as initial antiviral therapy to investigate the
drug’s efficacy and side effects, from January 2007 till now in our
hospital. Portion of the data between July 2007 and November
2009 were selected for analysis in this study. The dose of Entecavir
was 0.5 mg/d per os with average follow-up of 79.3 weeks.
Treatment was discontinued in the case of primary nonresponse
and all side effects were registered. The enrollment criteria were
mainly based on the Chinese official guideline for the treatment of
CHB [12]: HBV-DNA$105 copies/mL in HBeAg (+) patients or
HBV- DNA$104 copies/mL in HBeAg (2) patients; abnormal
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level $2 ULN (upper limit of
normal range, 50 U/L); Age .18 y and never received anti-HBV
therapy before this study. Exclusion criteria included: pregnant or
on breast feeding; underwent hepatotoxic, steatogenic, antineo￾plastic, systemic immuno-modulator treatment within a period of
6 month before the start of antiviral therapy; coexistent with
human immunodeficiency infection, autoimmune hepatitis, hepa￾tocellular carcinoma, Wilson’s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis, HCV infection and other virus
related hepatitis; neutrophil count ,1500/mm3 or platelet count
,100000/mm3
; a history of psychiatric disease; and evidences of
alcohol addiction from a well designed questionnaire [13]
recording the frequency, type and amount of alcohol consumption
(defined as alcohol intake $40 g/d in man and $20 g/d in
women over 5 years; or alcohol intake .80 g/d within 2 weeks).
In this cohort, we compared the baseline demographic,
anthropometric and serologic data between CHB patients with
and without steatosis, aiming to find associated factors of hepatic
steatosis. We then collected the patients’ clinical and biochemical
data at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk. Thereafter, we divided patients into
groups of response and nonresponse at different time spot and
compared the patients’ baseline characteristics. We used un￾matched design in this nested case control study because all
enrolled subjects had routine clinical and biochemical test so that
we don’t need matched controls to decrease research expenses.
Finally, we retrospectively divided patients into groups with and
without hepatic steatosis at baseline and then separately compared
their HBV-DNA clearance, HBe seroconversion in HBeAg (+)
patients and ALT normalization at above set time spots.
Demographic, anthropometric and serologic data
On enrollment, a precompiled form was filled out to collect
demographic and anthropometric data, including age, gender,
body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared), waist circumference (measured
midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest), race, family
history of HBV infection (defined as at least one of parents or
siblings have HBV), hypertension (defined as a patient on
antihypertensive drug for blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg)
and diabetes mellitus (DM, defined as fasting glucose $7.0 mmol/
L or with past history of diagnosed DM). Overweight and obese
were defined as BMI$25 kg/m2 and BMI$30 kg/m2
, according
to the WHO definition. Hepatic steatosis was detected by
ultrasound B examination.
At 24wk, 48wk and 96wk, an overnight fasting blood sample was
taken for routine analysis, including ALT, aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT),
fasting blood glucose (FBG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholesterol
(Chol), triglyceride (TG), uric acid. HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti￾HBc and HBsAb were detected by time resolved fluoroimmunoas￾say (TRFIA) on an Anytest TRFIA analyzer (SYM-BIO life science
CO., LTD, Shanghai, China). HBV-DNA level was quantitatively
measured using a fluorescent PCR detection kit (PG Biotech,
Shenzhen, China; Sensitivity: 500 copies/mL) on a LightCycler
real-time PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Ultrasound examination and Definition of response
Abdominal sonographic examination was performed on the
Ultrasound instrument of MYLAB90 (ESAOTE, Italy) by senior
specialists who were blind to the examinees’ medical history and
blood test results. The probe frequency was among 3–5 MHz. The
diagnosis of fatty liver is as followings: diffusely increased echogenicity
(bright) liver where the echogenicity is greater than kidney or spleen;
vascular blurring; deep attenuation of ultrasound signal [14].
Primary non-response is defined as ,1 log10 IU/mL decrease in
HBV-DNA level from baseline at 12wk of therapy. Basic virological
response is defined as undetectable HBV-DNA in both HBeAg
positive and negative CHB patients by real-time PCR assay at time
spot of 24wk, 48wk and 96wk. Virological breakthrough is defined as a
confirmed over 1 log10 IU/ml increase in HBV-DNA level,
compared with the lowest HBV-DNA level during therapy. HBeAg
serum conversion is defined as change of HBeAg from positive into
negative. ALT normalization is defined as ALT level decreases into
within the normal range. Advanced virological response is defined
as HBV-DNA clearance, HBeAg serum conversion in HBeAg (+)
patients and ALT normalization.
Statistics
Data were first assessed for normality and log transformed
where appropriate. Quantitative variant were expressed as mean
6 standard deviation (SD) or median with range once nonnormal
distribution was found. Student t test or Mann-Whitney U-test was
further applied. For qualitative variant, percentages or frequencies
were used and X2 test was chosen for further comparison. Binary
logistic regression using forward-conditional method was further
applied to determine significant variables from univariate analysis.
Hepatic steatosis and virological response were appointed as
dependent variables and categorized into binary outcomes as
absent or present, respectively. SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical
analysis through the whole process and p,0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
General characteristics of subjects
Totally 267 patents were selected in this study and 54 patients
were excluded from final analysis, for the reasons of primary non￾Hepatic Steatosis and Entecavir Treatment Failure

response, significant side effect, virological breakthrough, loss of
follow-up and so on (Figure 1). Considering the relatively high
exclusion rate, we compared baseline demographic, anthropomet￾ric and laboratory characteristics between those included and
excluded patients. As shown in Table 1, compared with included
patients, those excluded patients had significantly lower ALT level
(147.38630.15 vs 183.56651.02, p = 0.03) but higher ratio of
hepatic steatosis (46.3% vs 30.6%, p = 0.04). The other parameters
of NAFLD, including BMI, TG, waist circumference and obesity,
also showed increased tendency but did not reach statistical
significance.
All patients entering final analysis were Chinese with average
age of 37.3 y, ranging from 19 y to 64 y. The percentage of male
was 55.4% and the mean BMI was 25.76 Kg/m2
. The prevalence
of obesity, overweight, DM and hypertension were 13.6%, 36.6%,
6.1% and 15.0%, respectively. The mean waist circumference,
ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, TG, Chol, FBG and Uric acid levels were
84.21 cm, 183.56 U/L, 54.63 U/L, 72.65 U/L, 46.39 U/L,
1.23 mmol/L, 4.37 mmol/L, 5.06 mmol/L and 377.89 mmol/L,
respectively. The overall percentage of hepatic steatosis was 30.5%
(65/271) and the prevalence of HBeAg positive was 62.4%.
Patients’ HBV-DNA level was varied and nonnormal distributed,
with median of 4.51 * 106 copies/mL.
Association between steatosis and host or viral factors
As shown in Table 2, the distribution of age, sex and family
history of HBV infection were not significantly different.
Nevertheless, the BMI, waist circumference, serum FBG, TG
and uric acid levels as well as the percentages of obesity and
overweight were significantly higher in CHB patients with hepatic
steatosis (p,0.05). The percentages of DM and hypertension were
also higher in CHB patients with hepatic steatosis but did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.26; p = 0.13, respectively).
Furthermore, HBV-DNA level and the status of HBeAg positive
were equally distributed in CHB patients with and without
steatosis. Based on these univariate findings, logistic regression
showed that waist circumference, serum TG and uric acid levels
were independent factors of hepatic steatosis (Table 3).
Hepatic steatosis as an independent factor for Entecavir
treatment failure
The demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory
features of Entecavir responders and nonresponders at different
time spot were shown in Table S1, S2, S3. The rates of response to
Entecavir were 54.9%, 63.8% and 74.2% at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk,
respectively. At 24wk, BMI, Waist circumference and prevalence of
hepatic steatosis were significantly higher in nonresponders than in
responders (p,0.05, Table 4). Using multivariate regression,
hepatic steatosis was confirmed as an independent factor for basic
virological response (p = 0.017, Table 3). Other metabolic features
including obesity and overweight did not show significant
difference between those patients. Viral factors including HBV￾DNA level and percentage of HBeAg positive decreased in
nonresponders, but the extent did not reach statistical significance.
At 48wk, the factors significantly increased in nonresponders
were also BMI, waist circumference and hepatic steatosis (Table 4),
further revealed the influence of central obesity in virological
response. However, only hepatic steatosis was confirmed as an
independent factor under multivariate logistic regression
(p = 0.019, Table 3). As similar as at 24wk, there were no
significant differences in ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Chol, TG, FBG,
uric acid, DM, hypertension, family history of HBV, status of
HBeAg positive and HBV-DNA level between responders and
nonresponders. At 96wk, waist circumference and percentage of
hepatic steatosis continued to be significantly higher in nonre￾sponders (Table 4). Nevertheless, the increased level of BMI and
percentage of obesity did not reach statistical significance.
Intriguingly, HBV-DNA level was significantly lower in those
nonresponders (p = 0.04). Nevertheless, of those factors, only

hepatic steatosis was proved to be an independent factor under
multivariate logistic regression (p = 0.017, Table 3).
Association between hepatic steatosis and advanced
virological response
We further investigated the association between hepatic steatosis
and advanced virological response by post hoc analysis of our
prospectively enrolled cohorts. Different from previous nested case
control study, we separately compared the rates of HBV-DNA
clearance, HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalization be￾tween CHB patients with and without hepatic steatosis at separate
time spot. As shown in Table 5, the rate of HBV-DNA clearance
was significantly increased as 58.8%, 67.6% and 77.7% at 24wk,
48wk and 96wk in patients without hepatic steatosis. The rate of
ALT normalization was higher in patents without steatosis
throughout the whole time spot, but reached statistical significance
from 48wk. In contrast, there were no significant differences in
HBeAg seroconversion between two groups at 24wk, 48wk and
96wk.
Discussion
Nowadays, accumulated evidences showed that hepatic steatosis
is a common phenomenon in CHB patients, as we verified in
current study. We found that the prevalence of hepatic steatosis

was 30.5% in CHB patients, in agreement with most published
reports and higher than that in general population of 10%–24%
[15]. However, as patients included in this study were not
randomly chosen and those CHB patients with ALT level ,2
ULN were excluded, our findings may not represent the
prevalence of hepatic steatosis in general CHB patients. Besides,
the primary nonresponse in this study was relatively higher (7.1%,
Figure 1) than previous report [16], which may be due to low
patients’ compliance to drug administration. In addition, hepatic
steatosis and inflammation could also result in ALT increment,
which may mask real ALT change caused by HBV activation and
thus misclassified CHB patients into antiviral therapy. Therefore,
should we increase the criteria of antiviral therapy in CHB patients
with hepatic steatosis? Should we treat NAFLD before selecting
CHB patients with NAFLD for anti-HBV therapy? Those
interesting questions were raised from this study but needed
further investigation.
The demographic data were equally distributed between CHB
patients with and without hepatic steatosis (Table 2), showing high
inter-group balance. In this study, we found a significantly higher
BMI, waist circumference, uric acid and TG levels as well as
percentages of obesity and overweight in CHB patients with
hepatic steatosis. However, HBV-DNA level and status of HBeAg
positive did not show significant difference between those groups.
These findings supported the hypothesis that hepatic steatosis in
CHB patients is associated with metabolic factors than viral
factors. Since recognized as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic
syndrome, CHB patients with hepatic steatosis were supposed to
have higher percentages of DM and hypertension but the
difference in our study was not statistically significant (Table 2).
This might be due to the low amount of patients with these two
ailments. However, the FBG level in hepatic steatosis group was
significantly higher, supporting the coexistence of dys-regulated
glucose metabolism. Previous works found that BMI and TG were
independent factors for hepatic steatosis [8,17] while our findings
showed that waist circumference was also associated with hepatic
steatosis (Table 3). This result complemented previous findings
that BMI and waist circumference were associated with NASH
[18]. In addition, we also found uric acid as an independent risk
factor for hepatic steatosis, confirming our latest findings that uric
acid level was significantly associated with NAFLD [19].
Currently, Entecavir has been confidently considered as first￾line monotherapy of CHB, for its potent HBV inhibition ability
and a high barrier to resistance [20]. Nevertheless, the effect of
anti viral drugs in CHB patients with hepatic steatosis was rarely
reported. There was only one article showing none impact of
hepatic steatosis on the outcome of peg-a-interferon treatment in
CHB patients [21]. Therefore, this study firstly reported the
negative effect of hepatic steatosis on Entecavir treatment failure in
CHB patients. Such effect is biologically possible, as cellular fat
accumulation may decrease the contact area between drugs and
hepatocytes, causing reduced bioavailability of Entecavir [22].
Besides, diminished activity of hepatic cytochromes in steatotic
hepatocytes may also hamper drug metabolism [23]. In patients
with hepatitis C, insulin resistance and obesity coexisted with
hepatic steatosis may lead to dysfunction of cellular immune
function [24], which might be also true in CHB patients with
hepatic steatosis.
To further analyze the association between hepatic steatosis and
advanced virological response, we retrospectively separated CHB
patients into groups with and without hepatic steatosis and further
investigated the overall difference of antiviral effect from 24wk to
96wk. This in-depth analysis showed a significant effect of hepatic
steatosis on HBV-DNA clearance and ALT normalization
(Table 5). Our finding was of clinical importance as it may
change current mode of antiviral therapy in CHB patients with
hepatic steatosis. Moreover, it is rational to further investigate the
effect of treating hepatic steatosis on HBV antiviral therapy. We
have carried out an RCT (ClinicalTrials: NCT01148576) by using
Entecavir with essentiale or vitamin E to treat CHB patients with
hepatic steatosis. Besides, we did a preliminary multivariant
analysis on CHB patients without steatosis and found ALT was
significantly associated with Entecavir treatment failure at 24wk
(p = 0.03), in contrast with our previous finding (Table 3). This
result supports our hypothesis that hepatic steatosis caused ALT
elevation may mask real HBV activation caused ALT elevation.
Nevertheless, such association did not show statistic significance at
48wk and 96wk, which needs further study with larger subjects.
Admittedly, there are many shortages of this study. Firstly,
serum insulin level was not detected and insulin resistance was
previously shown to impair response to peginterferon plus
ribavirin in CHC patients [25]. Secondly, we did not analyze
HBV genotypes, where it is plausible that some genotypes exhibit
‘‘steatoviruses’’ characteristics, as shown in HCV genotype 3 [26].
Thirdly, we didn’t use liver biopsy in determining hepatic steatosis,
as this test is invasive and may cause both minor and major
complications [27]. In this study, as elevated HBV-DNA and ALT
levels were found in all CHB patients, there might be of less value
to preclude other causes of liver damage by biopsy. In contrast, the
non-invasive hepatic ultrasound showed a sensitivity over 80% and
specificity over 90% for steaosis [28]. Therefore, hepatic ultrasound
was used to detect steatosis in daily clinical practice for the strength
of the least expensive and most convenient modality [29], as was
done in our study. Fourthly, we only analyzed Chinese patients and
our results need verification in other ethnics. Finally, we have not
observed any resistance to Entecavir until the end of this study,
which may be due to the relatively short observation period and low
amount of subjects. Nevertheless, those weaknesses could not
overwhelm the original findings of this prospective unmatched
nested case control study, which may change the standard therapy
of CHB patients with NAFLD.
In summary, this study demonstrated, for the first time, that
hepatic steatosis is significantly associated with Entecavir treat￾ment failure in CHB patients. Current study also confirmed the
association of metabolic factors with hepatic steatosis. These novel
results raised the issue on developing specific treatment strategy in
CHB patients with NAFLD, which needs investigation in the
future. Further studies should also focus on the molecular
mechanism of steatosis on nonresponse to Entecavir and other
antiviral drugs.
