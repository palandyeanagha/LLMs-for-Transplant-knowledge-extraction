Abstract
The objective of the current study was to explore the role of ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genetic
polymorphisms in predicting the bioavailability of tacrolimus and the risk for post-transplant
diabetes. Artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models were used to
predict the bioavailability of tacrolimus and risk for post-transplant diabetes, respectively.
The five-fold cross-validation of ANN model showed good correlation with the experimental
data of bioavailability (r2 = 0.93–0.96). Younger age, male gender, optimal body mass index
were shown to exhibit lower bioavailability of tacrolimus. ABCB1 1236 C>T and 2677G>T/A
showed inverse association while CYP3A5*3 showed a positive association with the bio￾availability of tacrolimus. Gender bias was observed in the association with ABCB1 3435
C>T polymorphism. CYP3A5*3 was shown to interact synergistically in increasing the bio￾availability in combination with ABCB1 1236 TT or 2677GG genotypes. LR model showed
an independent association of ABCB1 2677 G>T/A with post transplant diabetes (OR: 4.83,
95% CI: 1.22–19.03). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis (MDR) revealed that syn￾ergistic interactions between CYP3A5*3 and ABCB1 2677 G>T/A as the determinants of
risk for post-transplant diabetes. To conclude, the ANN and MDR models explore both indi￾vidual and synergistic effects of variables in modulating the bioavailability of tacrolimus and
risk for post-transplant diabetes.
Introduction
Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that is prescribed to prevent acute rejection fol￾lowing solid organ transplantation such as kidney, liver, and heart transplantations [1–3]. It is
widely used agent, however, characterized by narrow therapeutic index and high inter-individ￾ual variability in dose requirement necessitating frequent therapeutic drug monitoring to pre￾vent acute rejection or renal toxicity [3]. The trough concentrations of tacrolimus are known
to influence the clinical outcome, i.e., prevention of organ rejection [4], whereas high trough
concentrations have been reported to cause toxicity [5, 6]. Acute rejection is a major causal

factor for long-term graft outcome, and it commonly occurs during the immediate post-trans￾plantation [7]. Several factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, body-weight, serum creatinine,
albumin, haematocrit, days after transplantation and the use of concomitant drugs will greatly
influence the tacrolimus pharmacokinetics [8, 9].
Several studies have examined the role of genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 and ABCB1
influencing tacrolimus concentration as well and its clinical outcome [10–13]. CYP3A51 is
the wild-type allele is associated with enzyme activity, while CYP3A53 is the most common
allele that causes splice defect and resulting in non-functional protein and thus requiring a
high dose of tacrolimus for the patients [14]. Many studies have investigated the association of
CYP3A51/3 polymorphism and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in renal transplantation [11,
12, 15, 16]. A significant association between the CYP3A51/3 variant allele and tacrolimus
pharmacokinetics was well established [17]. The dose required to reach the therapeutic con￾centration range was estimated to be twice as much as in carriers of at least one active CYP3A5
(AA/AG) allele than in non-carriers (GG) [13].
The role of polymorphisms in drug transporter, ABCB1 gene on trough concentrations of
tacrolimus yielded mixed results. One study described the association of ABCB1 polymor￾phisms with the dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentrations during the early period after
transplantation [18]. In another study, the ABCB1 2677G>T and ABCB1 3435C>T polymor￾phisms were found to be associated with lower dose-adjusted levels of tacrolimus and were at
increased risk of allograft rejection [19], whereas in another study, patients expressing the
wild-type ABCB13435CC genotype showed up to 40% lower concentration/dose ratios com￾pared with patients carrying variant alleles [20]. Several studies have found no association
between the tacrolimus trough concentration and ABCB1 polymorphisms [21–24]. Patients
with wild ABCB1 haplotype reported to have lower dose-normalized tacrolimus concentra￾tions compared with patients carrying the variant copy of this gene [25].
Recent studies have indicated the role of acquired as well as genetic factors which are associ￾ated with tacrolimus efficacy. For the precise dosing of tacrolimus, a number of algorithms
have been developed by using clinical and genetic factors namely CYP3A5 and ABCB1 [26–
32]. A randomized clinical trial, demonstrated the importance of CYP3A5 genotype-guided
tacrolimus dosing to achieve target tacrolimus trough (C0) levels after three days of tacrolimus
treatment [27]. Further, in the same study, they observed that patients took less time to reach
their target concentration with fewer dose modifications [27]. In a recent study on CYP3A4
and CYP3A5 genotypes revealed 56–59% variability in tacrolimus dose requirement and clear￾ance [26]. Low exposure to tacrolimus during early post-transplant days showed increased risk
of acute rejection [29]. The acute rejection is an early event with the greater number of occur￾rence within the first 12 weeks and lower incidences between 16 to 24-weeks of the post-trans￾plant period. Hence, any prediction model that predicts tacrolimus dose before the
transplantation by utilizing both acquired and genetic factors, to reach the therapeutic dose
faster with minimum dose adjustments may benefit to the patients. Hence, the present study
was carried to develop an algorithm for the prediction of tacrolimus dose by using acquired
and genetic factors in kidney transplant cases from south Indian population.

were recorded. The clinical outcomes considered are an occurrence of acute rejection, loss of
renal function and serious infections during six months of the study period. Patients with
impaired liver function, combined organ transplantation were excluded from the study. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS),
EC/NIMS/1379/2013 Hyderabad, India. Written informed consent was obtained from all the
subjects.
Immunosuppressive regimen
All the patients received the triple immunosuppressive regimen namely tacrolimus, mycophe￾nolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. One day prior to transplant, all the patients received a
daily oral treatment with tacrolimus at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg administered in two divided
doses. The dose was then adjusted according to C0 levels: 5–15 and 5–10 ng/ml during early
and late post-transplant phases, respectively. MMF was given at a dose of 720 mg twice daily
and 20 mg of wysolone per day.
Sample collection and measurement of tacrolimus (C0)
To determine the trough concentrations of tacrolimus, blood samples were collected from 54
patients on day 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 day post-transplantation before taking tacroli￾mus on that particular day. Tacrolimus concentrations were determined by commercially
available kit (Roche Diagnostics) by using fully automated immunology analyzer (Roche
Cobas E411). Appropriate quality control samples were also used for the quality check. The
sensitivity of this kit was 1 ng/ml. Dose-normalized tacrolimus concentrations (C0: dose,
ngml-1 per mg/day per kg body weight) were calculated by dividing the tacrolimus trough con￾centration (Co, ngml-1) by the daily dose adjust for body weight.
Genetic analysis
Whole blood samples were collected in EDTA vacutainers and the buffycoat was used for
genomic DNA isolation by using standard phenol-chloroform extraction method. CYP3A53
(6986A>G), ABCB1 1236 C>T and ABCB1 2677 G>T/C alleles were determined by using
Sanger’s sequencing, outsourced to Bioserve Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Hyderabad, India on
ABI Prism 3730XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). FinchTV software was used to
visualize the sequencing chromatograms and genotypes were noted comparing with reference
sequences. ABCB1 3435 C>T polymorphism was analyzed using PCR-RFLP method. The
PCR products were digested with Mbo I restriction enzyme. The Mbo I enzyme digestion of
the 197 bp PCR amplicon produces 158 bp and 39 bp product for the mutant type allele, but
fails to cleave the 197 bp fragment with wild type allele. Heterozygous allele produces 197 bp,
158 bp and 39 bp bands [33,34]. All the primers used for genotyping were represented in
Table 1. Sanger’s sequencing was done to confirm the genotyping in thirty percent of the sam￾ples and found 100% concordant.
Artificial neural network based algorithm development
We have used Bayesian averaging or error-correcting output coding, bagging and boosting as
the basis of the model. The computational website www.bigml.com was used for modeling.
The code is supplied as S1 Table. As illustrated in Fig 1, the ANN architecture was comprised
of three layers i.e. an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The input variables were
age, gender, body mass index, creatinine, CYP3A53 (6986A>G), ABCB1 3435 C>T, ABCB1
1236 C>T and ABCB1 2677 G>T/C. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was optimized

to ten based on the root mean square error (RMSE) statistics. The output variable in this model
is the bioavailability depicted in terms of the ratio of plasma tacrolimus concentration with the
oral dose. Experimental data ranges from input and output variables were tabulated as Table 2.
In order to have better validation, we have divided the data into 5 subsets by retaining 20% of
the data at a time and performed 5-fold cross-validation of our model. Mean square error and
regression coefficient were used as a measure to assess network performance. For this approach,
genotype data was computed as 0, 1 and 2 based on the number of variant alleles. For the devel￾opment of the model, we have used the computational website www.bigml.com.
Statistical analysis
To compute genotype data, 0 and 1 were used depending on the number of variant alleles. All
the SNPs were checked for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using χ2—test
between the observed and expected frequencies. In derivation and validation cohort samples,
Student’s t-test was done to assess statistically significant differences among the continuous
variables. Using Epimax calculator, the rate of overestimation and rate of underestimation
were calculated. A “p” value of <0.05 was considered as significant. Logistic regression analysis
was carried out to evaluate independent association of demographic and genetic variables with
post-transplant diabetes. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was carried out to
explore gene-gene interactions that increase the risk for post-transplant diabetes.
Results
In the present study, we included 129 renal transplant patients. There were 102 men and 27
women. The mean age was 34.2 ± 11.44 yrs; mean body mass index was 20.5 ± 3.5 kgm-2. At
the time of transplantation, hematological and biochemical parameters including liver func￾tion tests were within normal limits (Table 3). After 3 months of post-transplant, we observed
the acute rejection in 5.76% of the patients, viral infections (CMV, BK, HCV) in 2.88% of
patients, skin infection was seen in 0.96% of patients and repeated infections more than once
was observed in 5.76% of patients (Table 3).
All the patients were administered tacrolimus either once or twice daily. Additionally
98.1% received MMF (0.3–1.15 g/day) or 1.9% of patients received azathioprine (3–5 mg/day).
The mean tacrolimus dose administered one day prior to transplant was 5.2 ± 1.2 mg/day, day
3 was, 5.29 ± 1.6 mg, day 30 was 4.24 ± 1.04 (p<0.0001); and on day 60 was 3.04 ± 1.5 g/day
(p<0.001) (Table 4). Tacrolimus trough concentrations in 54 patients at predetermined days
(486 samples) obtained during oral administration in the first 3 months post-transplantation.
The initial tacrolimus dosing was based on individual’s body weight and subsequent doses

trough concentration ratio on day 3, 30 and 60 after transplantation was 120.7 ± 127.3,
77.54 ± 44.2 (p<0.001), and 94.6 ± 69.8 respectively. The percentage of patients within thera￾peutic range of tacrolimus (5–15 ng/ml) on day 3, 30 and 60 was 57.89, 48.65 and 34.8 percent￾age respectively, whereas below therapeutic range was 18.42, 48.65 and 65.52% and the
percentage above therapeutic range was 23.68, 2.7 and 0% respectively (Table 4).
All the polymorphism tested were found to be in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilib￾rium (HWE p>0.05). As shown in Fig 2, the five-fold cross-validation of ANN model (https://
bigml.com/dashboard/model/5a30b752af447f1798000c61) of bioavailability of tacrolimus
showed good agreement with the experimental data (r2 = 0.94 to 0.96). As shown in Fig 3, the
ANN simulations of the effect of age and gender on the tacrolimus bioavailability indicate that
women have more bioavailability of tacrolimus than men. With an increase in age, the bio￾availability was shown to increase in both the genders. On the other hand, in men, the higher
bioavailability of tacrolimus was observed in overweight and obese subjects. In women, no sig￾nificant impact of BMI on bioavailability of tacrolimus was observed (Fig 3A & 3B).
The ANN simulations depicting genotype based association of tacrolimus bioavailability in
men and women are shown in Fig 4. In men, the bioavailability of tacrolimus found to be high
in patients carrying mutant allele in CYP3A5 and ABCB1 3435C>T, whereas lower bioavail￾ability of tacrolimus was observed in patients carrying mutant allele in ABCB1 1236C>T and
2677 G>T/A (Fig 4A). On the other hand, in women, the bioavailability of tacrolimus was
found to be high in patients carrying mutant allele in CYP3A5 where as lower bioavailability
of tacrolimus was observed in patients carrying mutant allele in ABCB1 3435C>T, 1236C>T
and 2677 G>T/A (Fig 4B).
The ANN simulations showing gene-gene interactions in modulating tacrolimus bioavail￾ability is depicted in Fig 5. The bioavailability of tacrolimus was found to be highest in subjects
with CYP3A5 3/3/ABCB1 1236 TT combined genotype (Fig 5A). Subjects with CYP3A53/ 3/ABCB1 2677 GG genotype exhibited higher bioavailability of tacrolimus (Fig 5B). ABCB1
3435 C>T polymorphism increases the bioavailability of tacrolimus. The presence of CYP3A5 3/3 synergistically increases the bioavailability further (Fig 5C). The intestinal absorption of
tacrolimus was shown to be impaired in subjects harboring ABCB1 1236 C>T and 2677 G>T/
A and 3436 C>T allelic variants. The CYP3A53 polymorphism was shown to have a positive
association with the bioavailability. As shown in Fig 6, CYP3A53 variant interacts with vari￾ants of ABCB1 1236 and ABCB1 2677 to modulate the bioavailability of tacrolimus.
The acute rejection or dysfunction of the graft kidney was observed in 5.76% of the cases in
the early post-transplantation phase. All these cases were found to have CYP3A5 mutant
homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, whereas homozygous wild (AA), normal metaboli￾zer, had no observed cases of rejection. The correlation of the number of dose changes with
that of genotype AA genotype carriers have reached therapeutic range within 10 days of post
transplantation and is associated with frequent dose changes (26.9%). Whereas AG (40.1%)
and GG (32.93%) genotype carriers required 60 days of post transplantation with regular inter￾vals of dose adjustments to reach targeted therapeutic range.
When the genotype related to slow metabolism (GG) CYP3A5 associated with T allele of
ABCB1 gene (rs1128503, rs203258, rs1045642) in heterozygous or homozygous conditions
(CT & TT) requires a higher number of dose adjustments. On average there were 21.74% allied
with regular dose changes for first 10 days is observed to be normal metabolizers. The AG
genotype had 39.2% and GG genotype 39.2% of dose changes after the 10th day of tacrolimus
treatment. The CT and TT genotype counts together to 47.53% while CC counts for 10.3% and
other GG, GTand GA totally account to 6.5% dose changes.
As shown in Table 5, logistic regression analysis revealed the independent association of
ABCB1 2677 G>T/A with post-transplant diabetes. As shown in Fig 5, multifactor

dimensionality reduction analysis confirmed ABCB1 2677 G>T/A as the major determinant
of post-transplant diabetes, which is having strong interaction with CYP3A53 polymorphism.
Discussion
The maintenance of renal graft cases that are on tacrolimus is challenging to the clinicians
due to the narrow therapeutic index and wide inter-individual variability. Tacrolimus

concentrations fluctuate greatly during the immediate post-transplant period and may be the
causative factor for the increased rate of rejection and graft loss. Many studies have confirmed
that CYP3A5 polymorphisms have a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus
[35,36]. Patients who are homozygous for the CYP3A53 allele found to have lower dose
requirements and higher trough levels of tacrolimus after transplantation, as well as lower
clearance than patients expressing the CYP3A51 allele [23–29]. In the present study, we
found that patients carrying at least one CYP3A51 allele are associated with decreased bio￾availability of tacrolimus than patients carrying CYP3A53 allele, and this observation was
seen even up to 4 weeks after the transplantation. A similar observation was also demonstrated
in several studies showing transplant patients with at least one CYP3A51 allele had signifi￾cantly higher tacrolimus dose requirements and lower trough drug levels than CYP3A53
homozygotes [20, 37].
Renal transplant recipients carrying CYP3A53 allele have lower dose requirement of tacro￾limus when measured on 30, 90 and 180 days of post-transplantation as compared to
CYP3A51 and CYP3A51/3 [38]. In addition, several studies on CYP3A51 have demon￾strated two-fold higher tacrolimus dose requirement to achieve the target drug levels [36–39].
In a prospective study based on the CYP3A5 genotype, the rapid achievement of target trough
levels was observed in renal transplant recipients with fewer successive dose modifications
prior to the transplantation [27].
In the current study, the acute rejection or dysfunction of the graft kidney was observed in

study, it was found that low tacrolimus troughs in the early post-transplant period have been
associated with a higher rate of acute rejection [19]. The mean trough concentrations in the
first-week post-transplant have shown to be significantly different between the patients with
acute rejection and without rejection [28, 29].
Studies on ABCB1 polymorphisms have reported the association between P-glycoprotein
expression and function with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics [11–13]. However, contradictory
results have been reported regarding the effect of ABCB1 polymorphisms on tacrolimus kinet￾ics and efficacy in organ transplantations [21–24]. In a study by Wang et al., found an associa￾tion between the ABCB1 haplotype and blood tacrolimus concentration [32]. In another study
on renal transplants, patients with the wild-type ABCB1 genotype tend to have more stable
tacrolimus concentrations i.e., within the therapeutic range, during the 90 days after the trans￾plantation [40]. Whereas patients carrying mutant alleles, showed increased tacrolimus con￾centrations due to decreased elimination capacity, over 60% [40]. In addition to the above
study, wild-type ABCB1-3435CC genotype showed lower concentration/dose ratios compared
with patients carrying variant genotype [20]. In the present study, we also observed that
ABCB1 3435 variant genotype TT showed higher tacrolimus levels as compared to CT and CC
genotypes. On the other hand, ABCB1 2677 and ABCB1 1236 polymorphism did not showed
an association with the tacrolimus concentration.
Although there are no population-specific pharmacogenomic algorithms for Indians in pre￾dicting tacrolimus stable dose or bioavailability, however, certain polymorphisms were studied
in renal transplant cases. Study by Singh et al, found that the dose-adjusted tacrolimus and
cyclosporine levels were significantly lower in CYP3A5 expressers for cyclosporine and

tacrolimus as compared to the non-expressers [41]. In the same study, they observed that
CYP3A5 non-expresser genotype was associated with reduced risk for allograft rejection. Simi￾larly, studies with ABCB1 polymorphisms, patients carrying wild-type at ABCB1 2677G>T
and 3435C>T were associated with lower dose-adjusted levels and thereby were at increased
risk of allograft rejection [42]. Chandel et al, studied the CYP3A51/3 genotype influencing

the tacrolimus blood concentrations in response to metabolic inhibition by ketoconazole [43].
A number of algorithms containing clinical and/or pharmacogenomic factors have been con￾structed to predict tacrolimus dose [26–33]. In our previous studies, we have developed and

validated the algorithms for the precise prediction of warfarin dose [44, 45]. In the current
study, with age, gender, BMI, CYP3A53 (6986A>G), ABCB1 1236 C>T and ABCB1 2677
G>T/C genotypes using ANN model; we have developed an algorithm for the prediction of bio￾availability of tacrolimus. The tacrolimus-bioavailability model explained 86% of total variability
in the tacrolimus absorption and metabolism. The other contributing factors could be albumin,
hematocrit and liver function, that might influence during initial transplantation days [26].
In a prospective study on Caucasian kidney transplant patients, the effect of genotype￾guided tacrolimus dosing versus body weight-based dosing have indicated that genotype￾guided group had a higher proportion of patients within the targeted tacrolimus trough levels
by day three after dose initiation achieving target concentration rapidly with fewer dose modi￾fications [9, 13, 18]. In another study, it was observed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genotypes
could explain 56–59% variability in tacrolimus dose and clearance [25]. In a recent study,
Tang et al, utilized nine machine learning tools to predict the tacrolimus stable dose, and
found that all algorithms were equally effective in predicting tacrolimus therapeutic dose and
further demonstrated that regression tree (RT) model was the best among the other tools in
predicting the tacrolimus stable dose [46]. The major limitation of our study was the sample
size. Even though we developed the algorithm to predict the bioavailability of tacrolimus, we
need to validate in more number of cases for clinical utility of this algorithm for prediction of
the therapeutic dose before the renal transplantation.
Furthermore, the presence of variant alleles at ABCB1 2677 and CYP3A53 was shown to
increase the risk for post-transplant diabetes based on our MDR model, which coincides with
the higher bioavailability of tacrolimus in this genotype combination. This corroborates with
findings of Chitnis et al [47] who demonstrated higher dose normalized concentrations of
tacrolimus in patients with post-transplant diabetes and the higher risk was observed in sub￾jects with CYP3A53 polymorphism.
Conclusion
In conclusion, consistent with the literature, this study also demonstrates that the CYP3A53
allele and ABCB1 polymorphisms are highly associated with tacrolimus bioavailability in renal
transplant patients. In addition, this study confirms that the combination of multiple ABCB1
polymorphisms with CYP3A5 genotype as demonstrated by the ANN model has a stronger
effect to calculate more precisely the initial tacrolimus dose to improve the therapy and to pre￾vent the tacrolimus toxicity. The gene-gene interactions between ABCB1 and CYP3A5 also
influence the risk for post-transplant diabetes.
