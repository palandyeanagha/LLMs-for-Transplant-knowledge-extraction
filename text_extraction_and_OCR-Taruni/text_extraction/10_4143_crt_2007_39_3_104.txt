 Purpose: To assess the characteristics of bone meta￾stasis from hepatocellular carcinoma and the radiation 
field arrangement based on imaging studies.
 Materials and Methods: Fifty-three patients (84 lesions)
with bone metastasis from a primary hepatocellular carci￾noma completed palliative radiation therapy. All patients 
underwent one of following imaging studies prior to the ini￾tiation of radiation therapy: a bone scan, computed to￾mography or magnetic resonance imaging. The median 
radiation dose was 30 Gy (7∼40 Gy). We evaluated ret￾rospectively the presence of soft tissue formation and the 
adjustment of the radiation field based on the imaging
studies.
 Results: Soft tissue formation at the site of bony disease 
was identified from either a CT/MRI scan (41 lesions) or 
from a symptomatic palpable mass (5 lesions). The ad￾justment of the radiation field size based on a bone scan 
was necessary for 31 of 41 soft tissue forming lesions
(75.6%), after a review of the CT/MRI scan. The median 
survival from the initial indication of a hepatoma diagnosis 
was 8 months (2 to 71 months), with a 2-year survival rate 
of 38.6%. The median survival from the detection of a 
bone metastasis was 5 months (1 to 38 months) and the 
1-year overall survival rate was 8.7%.
 Conclusion: It was again identified that bone metastasis 
from a primary hepatocellular carcinoma is accompanied 
by soft tissue formation. From this finding, an adjustment 
of the radiation field size based on imaging studies is 
required. It is advisable to obtain a CT or MRI scan of sus￾pected bone metastasis for better tumor volume coverage 
prior to the initiation of radiation therapy. (Cancer Res

INTRODUCTION
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks third as the most 
common carcinoma, constituting approximately 11.3% of all 
tumors. Annually, approximately 11,000 new patients are dia￾gnosed with HCC in Korea. In 2004, HCC accounted for 22.6% 
of all cancer-related deaths, followed in frequency by lung 
cancer and gastric cancer. The overall 5-year survival rate, 
according to sex, was 11.8% for men and 13.3% for women 
(1).
 Due to developments in surgical techniques and the intro￾duction of effective local therapeutic modalities, such as trans￾arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radiofrequency ablation, 
the overall survival rate of HCC patients has increased, even 
in the cases of unresectable disease (2). However, there is also 
a higher chance for an extrahepatic metastasis, regardless of 
primary site control (3,4). The most favorable sites of 
extrahepatic metastasis from an HCC were the lung and central 
nervous system (CNS). In contrast to gastric cancer, lung 
cancer or breast cancer, the incidence of bone metastasis from 
HCC was rare, and the incidence has been reported as ranging 
from 3% to 20% (3∼7).
 In the cases of an extrahepatic metastasis, anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy is effective in a limited role as many patients 
have accompanying chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. The
reported response rate is about 20%, while the median survival 
is approximately 4 months (8).
 In general, radiation therapy is a preferred treatment modality 
for symptomatic palliation of a bone metastasis from many 
carcinomas. However, there have been few published reports 
about the role of radiation therapy for a bone metastasis from 
a primary HCC (9,10). Some studies with a limited number of 
patients have described the characteristics of bone metastasis 
from HCC, such as soft tissue formation (7,9,11∼13).
 The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics 
of bone metastasis from HCC and to evaluate the effectiveness 
of radiation therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
 1) Patient characteristics
 Between October 1994 and December 2004, a total 60 
patients were referred for palliative radiation therapy for bone 
metastasis from HCC. Fifty-three patients completed planned 
radiation therapy for 84 lesions. The remaining seven patients 
stopped treatment because of either their own refusal or 
deterioration of performance status regardless of treatment. The 
median age of all patients was 53 years-old (range 33 to 70 
years). With respect to performance status, 13 patients were 
scored as ECOG 1, 28 patients were scored as ECOG 2, and 
the remaining 12 patients were scored as ECOG 3. Thirty-seven 
patients had a single metastatic site, while 16 patients had 
multiple lesions. Twenty-three patients presented with synchro￾nous bony metastasis with a diagnosis of primary HCC. The 
median interval between the day of the initial HCC diagnosis 
and that of the metachronous bone metastasis was 8.5 months, 
ranging from 2 months to 70 months (Table 1).
 Of the 84 lesions treated, 48 lesions were examined with 
CT/MRI. Among them, 41 lesions were also examined with a 
bone scan. Thirty-one lesions were examined with a bone scan 
only. The remaining 5 lesions, despite of a lack of evaluation 
with either a CT/MRI or bone scan, revealed abnormal findings 
on a plain x-ray as symptomatic palpable masses.
 2) Radiation therapy
 Radiation therapy was delivered with a linear accelerator, 
utilizing 6 or 15 MV photon beams or electrons, according to 
the depth of the lesion. The treatment volume covered the gross
tumor volume (GTV), which was identified with imaging data, 
adding a margin of 1.5 to 2 cm in all directions. If vertebral 
bodies were targeted for treatment, the treatment volume 
included the vertebral bodies, plus one additional segment in 
both the cephalad and caudal directions. The median total dose 
was 30 Gy, ranging from 7 Gy to 40 Gy. The daily fraction 
size was 2.5 or 3 Gy, with the exception of a single fraction 
treatment of 7 Gy.
 We focused on the comparison of the size of the radiation 
field as determined with a bone scan only to the field size 
determined by both a bone scan and CT or MRI. We evaluated 
the need of adjustment of the radiation field according to the 
imaging modality. 
 After completion of radiation therapy, all patients received 
follow-up by either a hospital visit or phone call. The median 
period of follow-up was 6 months. Patient data was analyzed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS, 
Chicago, IL USA) software package. The Kaplan-Meier method 
was also used. The end-point was the day of the patient death, 
both from the day of the initial diagnosis of primary disease 
and from the day of the initial diagnosis of a bone metastasis.

RESULTS
 1) Disease characteristics
 Total 84 metastatic sites received radiation treatment. The 
C-T-L spines were the most common site (40 lesions), followed 
by the pelvic bone, including the hip joints (19 lesions), ribs
(9 lesions), upper and lower extremities (7 lesions), shoulder 
joint (4 lesions), skull (3 lesions), and sternum (2 lesions). 
 Among the 48 lesions evaluated by either CT or MRI, 41 
lesions showed bone destruction combined with soft tissue 
formation (Fig. l). There were additional 5 lesions with soft 
tissue formation, which were not examined with CT or MRI, 
but presented with clinically palpable soft tissue at the site of 
bone metastasis as observed on plain x-rays. 
 Metastatic lesions at the vertebrae were the most frequent 
ones with both bone destruction and soft tissue formation 
(27/29). Three soft tissue lesions were expressed as a cold spot 
(or as a photon defect) rather than with hot uptake as seen on 
the bone scan. However, there was no way to detect existing 
soft tissue formation around metastatic bone in lesions 
evaluated with a bone scan only (Table 2).
 2) Adjustment of the radiation field
 Forty-one lesions were examined with both a bone scan and 
by CT/MRI. We compared the radiation field size based on a 
bone scan image to the field size based on a CT/MRI image. 
Thirty-one lesions required an adjustment of the radiation field 
size when the radiation field size was determined with CT/MRI 
findings rather than with bone scan findings (Fig. 2). These 
lesions showed characteristic destruction of the bony framework
and infiltration into the surrounding muscle or fat tissue 
extensively. The extent of infiltration into the surrounding 
muscle or fat tissue determined the size of modification of the
radiation field. The amount of radiation field adjustment was 
an increment of an average 2.5 cm in length (range, 1∼7 cm).
 3) Survival
 At the time of analysis, we identified 50 patient deaths. 
Three patients were lost to follow-up. The median survival 
period of all patients from the day of the initial HCC diagnosis 
was 8 months (ranging from 2 to 71 months). The survival rate 
was 53.9%, 38.6% and 30.1% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. 
From the time of the initial diagnosis of bone metastasis, the 
overall survival rate was 8.7% at 1 year, with a median survival 

Sangwon Kim, et al：Bone Metastasis from Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma 107
period of 5 months (ranging from 1 to 38 months). Only one 
patient survived for more than 2 years. This male patient was 
diagnosed with a bone metastasis 6 years after the initial 
diagnosis of primary HCC. The median survival period of 
patients diagnosed with primary HCC and bone metastasis 
synchronously and metachronously were nearly the same-5 
months and 4.5 months, respectively (ranging from 2 to 38 
months, and 1 to 21 months, respectively). We evaluated the 
influence of prognostic factors by use of the log-rank test. By
univariate analysis, the presence of metastasis to other solid 
organs was the only significant prognostic factor. The 1-year 
survival rate of those patients that had another solid organ 
metastasis at the time of the diagnosis of a bone metastasis was 
0%, with a median survival period of 3 months, but the 1-year 
survival rate of patients that had only a bone metastasis was 
14.5% with a median survival period of 8 months (p=0.03). 
However, age, sex, performance status, primary disease status 
and multiplicity of bony metastasis did not have an impact on 
patient prognosis.
DISCUSSION
 A bone metastasis from a primary HCC is not common, with 
the incidence ranging from 3% to 20% (4∼7). Therefore, there 
are few studies concerning the role of radiation therapy for 
bone metastasis from HCC.
 As mentioned above, the most impressive characteristic of a 
bone metastasis from HCC was soft tissue formation that lyses 
the bone framework. Many established studies have been 
reported with a small number of cases. A retrospective study 
like the current study is rare.
 Fukutomi et al(7) reported the characteristics of bone 
metastasis from HCC. In that study, 24 cases comprising a total
of 29 lesions (83%) examined with MRI showed osteolysis by 
expansile soft tissue formation. In another investigation, Sato
et al. (11) found 5 osteolytic lesions by soft tissue formation
on ultrasonography. With a radiation dose of 30 Gy, there was 
more than a 50% reduction of gross tumor volume in all cases. 
In our study, all 41 lesions evaluated with a CT/MRI scan 
revealed expansile soft tissue formation. In addition, another 
five lesions presented with a palpable mass at the site of the 
metastasis.
 Seong et al(9) investigated the effectiveness of palliative 
radiation therapy for bone metastasis from HCC. In that study, 
51 patients received radiation therapy for 77 bony metastatic 
lesions, with a median total dose of 30 Gy. There was pain 
relief in 56 lesions (73%). The median survival period from the
occurrence of a bone metastasis was 5 months, with a 1-year 
survival rate of 15%.
 Kaizu et al(10) reported the influence of the dose-response 
relationship on palliation. Patients that received radiation with 
time, dose and a fractionation factor (TDF) in excess of 77 (i.e., 
a daily dose of 2 Gy for a total of 48 Gy, or a daily dose of 
3 Gy for a total of 39 Gy) showed better palliative responses 
than patients that received radiation with a TDF less than 77. 
The response rate was 83.8%, and the median survival period 
from the time of the initial occurrence of a bone metastasis was 
6 months. 
 In our study, bone destruction with soft tissue formation 
presented in 85.4% of all cases that were examined by CT or 
MRI. These bone destructive lesions tended to infiltrate the 
surrounding muscle or fat lesions. A bone scan, which indicated
abnormal findings within the bony structure, did not reveal the
entire extent of the mass lesion in many cases. Determination 
of the radiation field based on a bone scan only could not cover 
the entire mass lesion adequately. This study showed that 
approximately three-quarters of all cases need an adjustment of
the radiation field based on the findings of a CT/MRI scan as 
compared with cases that were based on a bone scan only. The 
median survival period from the occurrence of a bone 
metastasis in our study was 5 months, which was comparable 
with those of published results.
CONCLUSIONS
 This study confirmed the characteristic finding of soft tissue 
formation at a bone metastasis from a primary heapatocellular 
carcinoma. There is a high possibility that a bone metastasis 
from a primary hepatocellular carcinoma is expressed as a large
soft tissue mass lesion. The radiation field based on only a bone 
scan has a risk of a marginal miss. From this review, we 
suggest to obtain a CT scan or MRI scan of a suspected bone 
metastasis to define the radiation field adequately.
