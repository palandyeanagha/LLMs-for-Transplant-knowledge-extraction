EVALUATION OF NUTRITIONAL 
STATUS OF NONHOSPITALIZED 
PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS
Luciana CARVALHO and Edison Roberto PARISE
ABSTRACT – Background - Protein-calorie malnutrition is a frequent fi nding in patients with chronic liver disease, but 
investigations of nutritional status have been rarely performed in individuals seen at outpatient clinics. Aim - To evaluate the 
nutritional status of patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis, attended for the fi rst time at a reference outpatient 
clinic for liver diseases. Patients and methods - A total of 300 consecutive patients attended at the outpatient clinics of a 
reference center for liver diseases were investigated. Anthropometric evaluation was performed by the usual parameters: 
triceps skinfold, arm circumference and arm muscle circumference. Biochemical parameters included creatinine/height index, 
serum albumin and lymphocytes count. The nutritional diagnosis was based on the PCM score proposed by Mendenhall et 
al. Food intake was retrospectively evaluated using 24-hour dietary recall data. Results - About 71% of the patients studied 
were chronic alcohol abusers, whereas in 29% cirrhosis was of nonalcoholic etiology. Independently of the disease etiology 
75.3% of the patients showed some degree of protein-calorie malnutrition, which was moderate or severe in 38.3% of them. 
More advanced protein-calorie malnutrition degrees were associated with lower energy and protein intake. The prevalence of 
moderate or severe protein-calorie malnutrition was higher in patients classifi ed as Child-Pugh C than in patients classifi ed 
as Child-Pugh A (21% x 58%, respectively). Regarding sexual differences, fat reserves, evaluated by triceps skinfold, 
were more depleted in females than in males (48.6% x 26.6%) regardless of the etiology of the cirrhosis, whereas muscle 
reserves (arm muscle circumference) were more depleted in males (43.4% x 13.4%) regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis. 
In contrast, cirrhosis of alcoholic etiology was determinant in reducing arm muscle circumference in females (20% x 9.1%). 
Conclusions - These data highlight the high prevalence of protein-calorie malnutrition occurring early in the natural history 
of the disease and accompanying functional hepatic deterioration. In addition, attention should be paid to the different gender
patterns of response to protein-calorie malnutrition in these patients.

INTRODUCTION
A frequent fi nding in patients with liver cirrhosis is 
protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), leading to severe 
consequences to the general state and clinical evolution 
of the patient(8, 25, 27). It has been demonstrated that PCM is 
an independent risk factor for death among patients with 
chronic hepatic disease, contributing to the emergence of 
more severe complications in cirrhotic patients, such as 
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and infections(21).
Multiple factors which are common to the underlying 
disease directly contribute to malnutrition, among them, 
anorexia, nausea, defi cient food intake and absorption and 
catabolic state(16, 32). In addition, the many dietary restrictions 
used to control symptoms and specifi c complications, 
such as ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, aggravate the 
nutritional status, predisposing the patients to infections 
and worsening of the functional hepatic status(21, 34, 37).
The measurement of anthropometric parameters 
has been considered to be a reliable and safe method to 
assess nutritional status even in patients with cirrhosis, 
but most of these studies evaluate patients with cirrhosis 
who have been hospitalized, in general as a consequence 
of hepatic decompensation(17, 19, 28, 38).
In the present study we prospectively evaluate the 
nutritional status of patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic 
cirrhosis, attended for the fi rst time at a reference outpatient 
clinic for liver diseases. We correlated the anthropometric 
fi ndings with patient sex and etiology and functional 
status of hepatic disease.

PATIENT AND METHODS
A total of 300 patients with cirrhosis of the liver of different 
etiologies, attended consecutively for the fi rst time at the reference 
outpatient clinic for hepatic diseases of the Federal University 
of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, were included in this study.
The diagnosis of cirrhosis was confi rmed in 65% of the 
cases by liver biopsy. In the remaining cases the diagnosis 
was established by usual clinical and laboratory criteria(12), 
besides abdominal ultrasonography and digestive endoscopy. 
Functional status was classifi ed according to the Child-Pugh 
criteria(33). The patients were divided into two groups according 
to etiology of the disease:
• Group I - alcoholic cirrhotic: 213 patients with alcoholic 
cirrhosis of the liver due to intake of at least 80 g ethanol/day 
for males and 60 g ethanol/day for females for a minimal 
period of 5 years.This group consisted of 183 males and 30 
females patients, with a mean (mean + SD) age of 49.9 ±
10.1 years. Investigation of serum markers for hepatitis B 
and C virus showed that 22% of these patients presented 
positive serology for HBsAg or anti-HCV antibodies.
• Group II - nonalcoholic cirrhotic: 87 patients ingesting less 
than 20 g alcohol/day with cirrhosis of different etiologies, such 
as hepatitis B and C virus, autoimmune hepatitis, primary and 
secondary biliary cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. This group 
consisted of 43 male and 44 female patients, with a mean age of 
51.2 ± 14.9 years.
Exclusion criteria were: presence of localized or systemic 
infection, current digestive hemorrhage or hemorrhage during 
the last 3 months, evident renal failure or patient abandonment 
of the follow treatment at the outpatient clinic before completing 
the etiological investigation.
The patients were submitted to a nutritional evaluation on 
the fi rst visit by means of assessment of food intake parameters, 
anthropometric and biochemical parameters.
Food intake was retrospectively evaluated using 24-h our 
dietary recall data reported by the patients themselves or by 
the accompanying persons. These calculations were based on 
a standardized 24-h recall method(2). The daily intake of both 
energy and proteins was measured in kcal and in g/kg of ideal 
weight/d(9). The value of ethanol energy was not taken into account 
since practically all patients denied alcohol intake when arriving 
at the outpatient clinic.
The anthropometric evaluation was performed on the fi rst 
visit. All measurements were performed with the patient in 
the supine position according to the usual parameters: height, 
weight, triceps skinfold (TSF), arm circumference (MAC) and 
arm muscle circumference (MAMC) measured on the right arm, 
using established methods. The triceps skinfold was calculated 
as the mean of three measurements using the Lange skinfold 
caliper midway between the acromion and tip of the olecranon. 
Arm circumference was evaluated at the right arm, at a midpoint 
equidistant from the acromion and olecranon, with the patient 
in the upright position and the arm fl exed at 90°. The arm 
muscle circumference was calculated by the formula MAMC 
(cm) = MAC – [ π x TSF(cm)]. The creatinine/height index was 
calculated using the formula: CHI = 24-h urinary creatinine/ideal 
urinary creatinine x 100, with a urine volume never less than 
500 mL/24-h of a patient not in use of diuretics. Ideal urinary 
creatinine was obtained by the formulas: 23 mg x ideal weight, 
for male; 18 mg x ideal weight, for female(13, 14).
Blood and 24-h urinary creatinine and lymphocyte count 
were obtained using an automated method. Albumin values were 
obtained by cellulose acetate electrophoresis.
For the nutritional diagnosis, the anthropometric parameter and 
biochemical values(4, 13, 14) were compared with FRISANCHO’S 
reference standards(11). The values obtained according to percentage 
of adequacy were classifi ed using the PCM score proposed by 
MENDENHALL et al.(23):
PCM = %TCF +%MAC+ %MAMC + %lymphocite + %album + %CHI
 6
The score values were classifi ed into: no malnutrition 
(>100%), mild malnutrition (99.9%-80%), moderate malnutrition 
(60%-79.9%) and severe malnutrition (<60%) according to the 
recommendation of BLACKBURN et al.(3).
Nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis of the 
results. The Kruskal-Wallis’ test and chi square test complemented 
by Fisher’s test when necessary were used for the comparison 
of means and frequencies within each group, respectively. The 
level of signifi cance was set at 5%(39).
All patients were instructed regarding the purpose of the 
research and gave written informed consent to participate in 
the study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Federal University of São Paulo.
RESULTS
A total of 300 patients, 226 males and 74 females, age 
mean of 50.9 years, were enrolled in the study. Seventy-one 
percent of the patients had cirrhosis of alcoholic etiology 
(with or without concomitant investigation of hepatitis B 
and C virus), whereas 29% had cirrhosis of nonalcoholic 
etiology. The patients were functionally classifi ed according 
to the Child-Pugh criteria.
As can be seen in Table 1, the groups were comparable 
regarding age and functional hepatic status, differing only in 
terms of larger number of females in the nonalcoholic groups, 
as expected.

On the fi rst visit at the outpatient clinic, 75.3% of the patients 
already showed some degree of PCM with 38.3% of them presenting 
moderate and severe PCM. A higher prevalence of eutrophic patients 
and with mild PCM was observed among Child A patients than 
among patients classifi ed as Child B and C (Table 2).
No signifi cant differences were observed between alcoholic 
patients with or without association with hepatitis B and C virus 
(data not shown).
The prevalence of PCM among alcoholic and nonalcoholic 
cirrhotic patients was 74.2% and 78.2%, respectively, with no 
signifi cant differences in the classifi cation of the nutritional status 
as a function of the etiology. The prevalence of PCM was 74.8% 
in males and in 77%, females, without signifi cant differences 
between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients according 
to the sex variable (Table 3).

On the fi rst visit at the outpatient clinic no signifi cant differences 
were observed between the nutrients: energy, protein, carbohydrates and 
total fat in alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients (Table 4).
A progressive decrease in energy and protein intake by the 
patients was observed with worsening of nutritional status. 
However, only the comparison the energy and protein intake 
between normally nourished and malnutrition patients reached 
statistical signifi cance. No signifi cant differences were observed 
between the various degrees of PCM, except for the percentage 
of adequacy of protein requirements which was higher in patients 
with mild malnutrition than in patients with moderate and severe 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh malnutrition (Figure 1).

Based on TSF values, the groups already presented a 50% 
loss of fat reserves regardless of the etiology of the disease. 
However, this loss was more signifi cant in females (46.6% 
presented a moderate to severe TSF loss) than in males 
(26.5%). This difference was maintained when the patients 
were divided according to sex and etiology, that is, there 
was a signifi cantly greater TSF loss in female alcoholic and

of the same group (Table 5).

The MAMC values were signifi cantly more affected in the 
male than in female cirrhotic patients regardless of the etiology 
of the disease. The alcoholic cirrhotic patients presented signs of 
malnutrition more frequently than the nonalcoholic patients, but when 
these patients were compared according to etiology, no signifi cant 
differences were observed between alcoholic and nonalcoholic 
males (Table 6). In contrast, the use of alcohol by females was 
accompanied by a more signifi cant MAMC loss than observed in 
females of the nonalcoholic cirrhotic group (Table 7).

DISCUSSION
PCM is a frequent fi nding in cirrhosis of the liver, with severe 
consequences for the general status and the clinical evolution of 
the patient(10, 18, 30). Investigations of nutritional status have been 
preferentially performed on hospitalized patients but there are 
a few studies on PCM prevalence and on consequences of the 
early nutritional status to the recovery of these patients with 
liver diseases. In the present study the prevalence of PCM was 
investigated only in cirrhotic outpatients seen at a secondary 
reference service. Thus most patients arrived with a disease 
already diagnosed having already received medical care, and 
25% had already some dietary restriction.
Among the causes of chronic liver disease there was a high 
prevalence of alcoholic etiology and most of the patients were 
males. The mean age of approximately 50 years also agreed with 
observations made in other studies(22, 26).
Because of the diffi culty to assess separately each of the 
anthropometric and biochemical parameters, several methods 
have been advocated for the classifi cation of PCM(1, 20, 22, 30, 36, 40). 
In the present study, the nutritional diagnosis was made using 
the PCM score proposed by MENDENHALL et al.(23) which 
assigns value to the whole set of parameters used(23, 24).
Evaluation of the nutritional status in the study population 
showed a PCM prevalence of 75.3%, similar to that observed 
in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These results 
emphasize the fact that impairment of nutritional status in patients 
with cirrhosis of liver occurs even in the absence of the most 
severe complications of the disease.
Despite its limitations the 24-h dietary recall indicated a defi cient 
protein-energy intake by these patients, in addition to the fact that 
they tend to overestimate food intake when this intake is defi cient(5, 7). 
In the present study, mean protein-energy intake, when corrected 
for unit of ideal weight, did not satisfy the nutritional requirements 
of these patients which are 45 kcal and 1.5 g protein(5, 18, 26, 29). In 
patients with moderate and severe PCM, mean protein intake did 
not reach 70% of the patients’ requirements. Considering that most 
of the present patients with cirrhosis of the liver were alcoholics and 
had discontinued the use of ethyl alcohol at the time of the visits, 
it is possible that these data, in fact, represented an overestimate 
of the protein intake by these patients during the disease.
This study also confi rms the important relationship between 
PCM and liver function already observed by others(17, 22, 30). While 
only 21% of Child A patients presented moderate or severe PCM, 
this was observed in approximately 52% of Child B and 58% of 
Child C patients. No correlation was found between Child-Pugh 
numeric classifi cation and protein-energy intake. 
The association of a deteriorated nutritional status with 
advance hepatic disease has been attributed to anorexia and to 
the dietary restrictions imposed on the patients as a function of 
the complication of chronic disease such as ascites and hepatic 
encephalopathy. In addition, due to these complications and to the 
high prevalence of infections, these patients are in an important 
hypermetabolic state(22, 23). The changes explain the nutritional 
differences observed in this study and in others(19) among patients 
with compensated (Child A) and patients with more advanced 
disease (Child B and C). In addition, also in agreement with data 
reported by others(15), 21% of Child A patients evaluated already 
presented moderate or severe PCM, indicating that factors other 
than those mentioned earlier may infl uence the nutritional status 
of these cirrhotic patients.
A deteriorated nutritional status in advanced liver disease 
has been associated with a more restrictive diet due to major 
complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites and encephalopathy, 
that can also be associated with anorexia and weight loss. These 
patients also are hypermetabolic due to these complications and 
to the increased incidence of infections(22, 23).

As also reported by others(15, 17, 19, 22, 30), we did not detect 
signifi cant differences in nutritional status between alcoholic 
and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients. In alcoholics, anorexia, 
gastrointestinal disorders, malabsorption of nutrients and 
intestinal alterations are some aspects which may lead to 
malnutrition. In order to study the impact of alcohol intake, 
the cirrhotic patients were divided into two groups according 
to the presence or absence of previous alcohol abuse in their 
clinical history. Since the groups did not differ regarding the 
functional status of the disease, they could be compared in terms 
of possible differences in nutritional status. The absence of a 
difference between the groups studied is in agreement with other 
reports(7, 19, 36). In studies in which the prevalence of PCM was 
higher in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics, this difference could 
be attributed to a higher frequency of patients with advanced 
hepatic dysfunction in the former group. 
About 20% of our patients have concomitant viral infection due 
to hepatitis B or C. Hepatic biopsies from such patients showed 
that some of them were, in fact, patients with liver cirrhosis due 
to viral infection and not to alcoholic liver disease. As also done 
by others(19, 20, 23, 24) we decided to assign to a single group all 
patients with a history of alcoholism. In addition, all of these 
patient were heavy drinkers consuming large doses of alcohol 
which can cause PCM of themselves, as extensively demonstrated 
in the literature(15, 22, 24, 29). On the other hand, the results obtained 
after excluding these patients did not differ signifi cantly from 
those obtained for the group as a whole. 
Among the anthropometric parameters, only muscle 
reserves, evaluated by MAC and MAMC, were found to be more 
signifi cantly affected in alcoholic cirrhotic patients when compared 
with nonalcoholic patients(20, 21, 22). This frequent reduction in 
muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis of alcoholic etiology is 
probably related to a direct effect of alcohol on skeletal muscle 
metabolism(6, 31, 35). It is important to mention that the patients 
studied here were comparable regarding liver function, nutritional 
status evaluation and protein-calorie intake.
Regarding sexual differences, fat reserves, evaluated by 
TSF, were more depleted in females (48.6%) than in males 
(26.6%), regardless of the etiology of the cirrhosis. On the 
other hand, muscle reserves evaluated by MAMC were more 
depleted in males (43,4%). These alterations were independent 
of the etiology of cirrhosis since MAMC values did not 
differ between alcoholic and nonalcoholic males. In contrast, 
in females the alcohol factor was determinant in reducing 
MAMC (20% against 9.1% in nonalcoholics). These results 
are similar to those observed in a study performed in Italy(15)
on hospitalized patients with cirrhosis of the liver and in a 
study by CAMPILLO et al.(6) on alcoholic and nonalcoholic 
patients without cirrhosis of the liver. These data point to 
important differences in the form of PCM presentation 
between males and females with cirrhosis of the liver. It is 
possible that, as suggested by LOLLI et al.(19), these differences 
are due only to a larger amount of fatty tissue in females 
which will progressively be utilized to supply the metabolic 
requirements of the body and thus would spare the muscle 
reserve for more advanced stages when the fat reserves have 
been fully consumed(15).
The present study demonstrated that the nutritional loss of 
patients with cirrhosis of the liver precedes their hospitalization, 
occurring early in the natural history of the disease and 
accompanying the functional hepatic deterioration. Evaluation 
of the nutritional status of these patients should be part of the 
routine of outpatient clinic attendance regardless of the etiology 
of the disease. In addition, attention should be paid to the different 
patterns of response to PCM between males and females with 
cirrhosis of the liver.

com cirrose hepática (alcoolistas e não-alcoolistas), atendidos na primeira consulta em ambulatório de referência para doenças hepáticas. 
Pacientes e métodos - Trezentos pacientes consecutivamente atendidos pela primeira vez em ambulatório de doenças hepáticas foram incluídos 
neste estudo. Os mesmos foram submetidos a avaliação nutricional que constou de antropometria: dobra cutânea do tríceps, circunferência do 
braço e circunferência muscular do braço, e bioquímica: índice creatinina/altura, albumina sérica e contagem total de linfócitos. O diagnóstico 
do estado nutricional foi baseado pelo escore de desnutrição calórica e protéica proposto por Mendenhall e colaboradores e a ingestão alimentar 
por recordatório de 24 h. Resultados - Setenta e um porcento dos pacientes cirróticos estudados foram de causa alcoólica e 29% não-alcoólica. 
Independentemente da causa, a prevalência de desnutrição calórica e protéica foi de 75,3%, sendo que 38.3% deles já a apresentavam moderada 
e grave. Os pacientes com desnutrição calórica e protéica moderada e grave apresentavam pior ingestão de proteína e energia. A prevalência 
de moderada e grave foi mais elevada nos pacientes classifi cados como Child-Pugh C do que nos pacientes classifi cados como Child-Pugh A 
(21% x 58%, respectivamente). Em função das variáveis sexo e causa, as reservas de gordura, avaliadas pela dobra cutânea do tríceps, estiveram 
mais depletadas em mulheres cirróticas que nos homens cirróticos (48,6% x 26,6%). Já as reservas musculares, avaliadas por circunferência 
muscular do braço, estiveram mais depletadas em homens cirróticos (43,4% x 13,4%), independentemente da causa da cirrose. Em contraste, 
mulheres cirróticas alcoólicas apresentaram maior redução de circunferência muscular do braço que nas mulheres não-alcoólicas (20% x 9,1%). 
Conclusões - Os pacientes cirróticos já apresentavam elevada prevalência de desnutrição calórica e protéica na primeira consulta em ambulatório, 
principalmente nos pacientes com piora da função hepática. A variável sexo é outro aspecto que deve ser enfocado pois infl uenciou aspectos 
antropométricos (circunferência muscular do braço e dobra cutânea do tríceps) nesses pacientes.
