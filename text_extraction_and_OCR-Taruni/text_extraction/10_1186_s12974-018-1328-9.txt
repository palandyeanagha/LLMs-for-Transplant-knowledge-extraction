Abstract
Background: The end-organ effects of alcohol span throughout the entire body, from the gastrointestinal tract to
the central nervous system (CNS). In the intestine, alcohol use changes the microbiome composition and increases
gut permeability allowing translocation of microbial components into the circulation. Gut-derived pathogen￾associated signals initiate inflammatory responses in the liver and possibly elsewhere in the body. Because previous
studies showed that the gut microbiome contributes to alcohol-induced liver disease, we hypothesized that
antibiotic administration to reduce the gut microbiome would attenuate alcohol-induced inflammation in the brain
and small intestine (SI).
Methods: Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were fed alcohol in a liquid diet or a calorie-matched control
diet for 10 days with an acute alcohol binge or sugar on the final day (acute-on-chronic alcohol administration).
Some mice were treated with oral antibiotics daily to diminish the gut microbiome. We compared serum levels of
TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β by ELISA; expression of cytokines Tnfα, Mcp1, Hmgb1, Il-17, Il-23, Il-6, and Cox2; and
inflammasome components Il-1β, Il-18, Casp1, Asc, and Nlrp3 in the CNS and SI by qRT-PCR. Microglial morphology
was analyzed using immunohistochemical IBA1 staining in the cortex and hippocampus.
Results: Antibiotics dramatically reduced the gut microbiome load in both alcohol- and pair-fed mice. Alcohol￾induced neuroinflammation and increase in SI cytokine expression were attenuated in mice with antibiotic treatment.
Acute-on-chronic alcohol did not induce serum TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β. Alcohol feeding significantly increased the
expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as Tnfα, Mcp1, Hmgb1, Il-17, and Il-23 in the brain and intestine.
Reduction in the gut bacterial load, as a result of antibiotic treatment, attenuated the expression of all of these alcohol￾induced proinflammatory cytokines in both the brain and SI. Alcohol feeding resulted in microglia activation and
morphologic changes in the cortex and hippocampus characterized by a reactive phenotype. These alcohol-induced
changes were abrogated following an antibiotic-induced reduction in the gut microbiome. Unexpectedly, antibiotic
treatment increased the mRNA expression of some inflammasome components in both the brain and intestine.
Conclusions: Our data show for the first time that the acute-on-chronic alcohol administration in mice induces both
neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation and that reduction in the intestinal bacterial load can attenuate
alcohol-associated CNS and gut inflammation. Gut microbiome-derived signals contribute to neuroinflammation in
acute-on-chronic alcohol exposure.

Background
Prolonged alcohol consumption leads to translocation of
gut bacterial components, such as endotoxin, from the in￾testinal lumen into the circulation [1–3]. Once absorbed,
alcohol along with gut-derived endotoxin is delivered via
the portal circulation to the liver where metabolism begins
and an inflammatory cascade is initiated. However, endo￾toxin, unmetabolized alcohol, and alcohol metabolites also
pass through the liver and reach the systemic circulation
and other organs, including the peripheral immune system
and the central nervous system (CNS). While previous
studies have investigated the direct effects of alcohol on
the brain [4–6], little is known about the role of
gut-derived microbial products and their impact on the
nervous system and neuroinflammation.
Microglia play a critical role in sensing and responding
to alcohol consumption and are involved in multiple im￾mune signaling pathways [7–10]. Microglia express
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition recep￾tor critical in alcohol-induced neuroinflammation [11–
13] as well as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3
(NLRP3) inflammasome [9]. Previous studies showed
that TLR4 knockout mice are protected from increased
cytokine expression in various regions of the brain and
from increased activation of microglia [14–16]. TLR4
recognizes endogenous danger signals such as HMGB1
[17, 18] and is the major pattern recognition receptor of
bacterial endotoxin (also known as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)) [19]. Although endotoxin is not generally believed
to cross the blood-brain barrier [20], data from TLR4
knockout mice suggests that signaling through TLR4 is
an important component influencing alcohol-induced
neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is mediated by
the inflammasome complex, a multiprotein complex that
senses pathogens and danger signals leading to cleavage
and release of proinflammatory IL-1β and IL-18 [9].
LPS signaling is also a critical component of liver path￾ology associated with alcohol consumption. Alcohol me￾tabolism leads to cell stress, hepatocyte damage, and
release of sterile danger signals in the liver [21, 22]. Endo￾toxins, derived from the intestinal microbiome into the
portal circulation, are recognized by pattern recognition
receptors such as TLR4 and initiate an inflammatory re￾sponse secondary to the hepatocyte stress and damage
caused by the release of reactive oxygen species and other
cellular stresses induced by alcohol metabolism. Interest￾ingly, we and others have shown that treating mice with
antibiotics to reduce the bacterial load in the gastrointes￾tinal tract (and thereby reducing endotoxin levels) attenu￾ates liver inflammation and steatosis after alcohol use
[23–25]. This reduction in gut bacterial load could ameli￾orate the alcohol-induced changes in the brain.
To further explore the critical role of the gut microbiome
in the gut-brain axis, we used antibiotics to reduce the
intestinal bacterial load in mice. Following acute-on-chronic
alcohol consumption in mice (10 days of alcohol followed
by an acute alcohol binge), we show that alcohol induces
neuroinflammation in the CNS and also increases cytokine
expression in the small intestine. Inflammation in both or￾gans was attenuated with antibiotic-induced microbiome re￾duction. Interestingly, although cytokine expression was
reduced, antibiotic treatment induced the mRNA expres￾sion of inflammasome components and cytokines processed
by the inflammasome in the CNS and intestine. These re￾sults show for the first time that manipulation of the gut
microbiome via reduction of the microbial load protects
from alcohol-induced CNS and intestinal inflammation.
Our study provides important insights into the interactions
of the intestinal microbiome and brain in the gut-brain axis
induced by alcohol.
Methods
Mouse alcohol feeding
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Ani￾mal Care and Use Committee at the University of Massa￾chusetts Medical School (UMMS). Wild-type C57BL/6J 6-
to 8-week-old female mice were purchased from Jackson La￾boratories and co-housed in the UMMS Animal Medicine
Facility. Female mice were chosen because they are more
susceptible to alcohol-induced liver injury than male mice
[26–28]. Alcohol feeding followed the acute-on-chronic
model previously described by Bertola et al. [29]. Briefly, all
mice received the pair-fed Lieber-DeCarli (Bio-Serv) liquid
diet for 5 days. Some mice then received 5% alcohol and
maltose dextran in a liquid diet while pair-fed mice
remained on the control liquid diet. Pair-fed mice were
calorie-matched with the alcohol-fed mice. Nine hours prior
to sacrifice, alcohol-fed mice received alcohol via oral gavage
(5 g kg−1 body weight) and pair-fed mice received isocaloric
maltose dextran.
Antibiotic treatment
Mice were either treated twice daily with an oral intragastric
gavage of water or a broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail
(Abx) containing ampicillin (100 mg/kg body weight (BW);
Sigma), neomycin (100 mg/kg BW; Gibco), metronidazole
(100 mg/kg BW; Sigma), and vancomycin (50 mg/kg BW;
Sigma). Gavages began on the first day of liquid diet and
continued daily until the completion of alcohol feeding. Sig￾nificant reduction in bacterial load was confirmed by bacter￾ial culture (described below) similar to previous reports [23].
Bacterial culture
Mouse feces were collected directly from the anus and sus￾pended in thioglycolate media. Suspensions were plated on
non-selective LB agar plates (EMD Millipore) and incu￾bated for 24 h at 37 °C for assessment of bacterial load
reduction.

qPCR analysis
RNA extraction from the small intestine and brain cortical
tissue was performed using miRNeasy Extraction Kit (Qia￾gen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including
on-column DNase digestion (Zymo Research). Reverse
transcription for cDNA was completed from 1 μg of RNA
and subsequent 1:5 dilution in nuclease-free water.
Real-time qPCR using SYBR Green (BioRad) was per￾formed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RT-qPCR primers are listed in Table 1, and 18S mRNA ex￾pression was used as a housekeeping gene for 2−ΔΔCt
method of RNA expression analysis. For 16S comparison
between antibiotic-treated and non-treated animals, stool
bacterial DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Stool
Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After running a qPCR reaction using 16S primers similar to
described above, a ΔCt was calculated using the average Ct
value of each sample duplicate and subtracting the average
ΔCt of untreated pair-fed mice. The bacterial 16S PCR
product was run on a 1% agarose gel to visualize the rela￾tive reduction in bacterial load.
Serum cytokine measurement
Mice were cheek-bled prior to sacrifice, and serum was
isolated. TNFα and IL-6 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA,
USA) and IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
were measured by ELISA.
Immunohistochemistry
Following sacrifice, brain tissue was dissected and fixed in
10% formalin overnight before paraffin embedding.
Immunohistochemical staining was completed at the
UMMS Morphology Core using anti-ionized
calcium-binding adapter molecule (IBA1) antibody (Wako;
1:1000) and subsequently labeled with streptavidin-biotin
immunoenzymatic antigen for detection with 3,3′-diamino￾benzidine (DAB) (UltraVision Mouse Tissue Detection Sys￾tem Anti-Mouse HRP/DAB; Lab Vision). Images were
acquired from the described CNS areas by light microscopy
(cortex; CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus) at × 40
magnification for process length and cell body size mea￾surements of microglia using ImageJ. Cell process length
for each microglial cell was measured by tracing all exten￾sions off of the soma to their distal termination using Ima￾geJ’s freehand measuring tool. For each microglia, the
length of all processes was summed to obtain the total cell
process length. The soma area was measured by tracing the
perimeter of the cell body and measuring the contained
area using ImageJ’s freehand tracer and the area measure￾ment function. Microglia were analyzed from five to nine
images taken randomly from each CNS region from each
mouse. The investigator was blinded to the sample groups
during staining, image acquisition, and ImageJ analysis.
IBA1 positivity was measured using the Color Deconvolu￾tion plug-in in ImageJ.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad
Prism Version 7.0 using Mann-Whitney test. p < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Outlier exclusion
was calculated using Grubbs’ outlier test with alpha set
to 0.05.

Results
Antibiotic treatment dramatically decontaminates gut
bacterial load
While the modulating effects of chronic alcohol administra￾tion have been studied in the gut microbiome, alcoholic
liver disease, and neuroinflammation, it is unclear how
shorter alcohol use and/or alcohol binge affect inflamma￾tion signaling in the CNS and what role the gut micro￾biome plays in this process. In this study, mice received 5%
alcohol (EtOH) in a liquid diet for 10 days (after a 5-day li￾quid diet acclimation period), followed by a one-time alco￾hol binge or a calorie-matched pair-fed (PF) diet [29].
Female mice were chosen because they have greater sensi￾tivity to alcohol, and previous studies have focused on fe￾male animals [26–28]. To elucidate the importance of the
gut microbiome in the translocation of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the intestine to
extra-enteric organs, we used oral administration of a cock￾tail of antibiotics (ampicillin, neomycin, vancomycin, and
metronidazole) to drastically reduce the bacterial load in
the gut (Fig. 1a). Oral antibiotic treatment (Abx) caused a
significant reduction in endotoxin in the circulation at the
time of sacrifice both in pair-fed and alcohol-fed mice
(Fig. 1b). The expression of 16S bacterial DNA, measured
from mice stools collected immediately prior to sacrifice,
was dramatically reduced by antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1c,
d). Stool bacteria cultured on non-selective agar plates also
revealed almost complete elimination of culturable colonies
after 5 days of antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1e). Some recovery
of bacteria in the stool was observed by the conclusion of
the 15-day study, likely due to the development of anti￾biotic resistance (Fig.1e). However, bacterial colony-forming
units (CFUs) were dramatically reduced in the stool ob￾tained on the day of sacrifice in antibiotic-treated animals
compared with untreated mice (Fig.1f). Together, these
data indicate that antibiotic treatment successfully sup￾pressed gut bacterial load and reduced circulating endo￾toxin in both pair- and alcohol-fed mice.
Fig. 1 Oral antibiotics significantly reduce the gut bacterial load. a Four groups of wild-type C57BL/6J female mice were treated with pair-fed diet
(PF; n = 5), 5% alcohol diet (EtOH; n = 10), oral antibiotics (Abx) with PF (n = 6), or Abx with EtOH (n = 9). An acute sugar or alcohol binge was
given 9 h before sacrifice. b Serum endotoxin was measured at sacrifice to determine translocation of gut bacterial products into systemic
circulation. c DNA was isolated from the stool of PF and EtOH mice before sacrifice, and 16S DNA was measured by qPCR using universal 16S
primers. d The PCR products from c were run on an agarose gel for a general comparison of the four groups. e Stools were resuspended in
thioglycolate and plated on non-selective agar to measure gut bacterial load prior to antibiotic treatment (untreated), after 5 days of Abx
treatment (Abx day 5), and at the end of the experiment (Abx day 15). f Colony-forming units (CFUs) were quantified from stool extracted at
sacrifice on day 15. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 5–10 mice/group. *p < 0.05; n.s., not significant

Gut decontamination abrogates alcohol-induced
proinflammatory cytokine expression in the brain cortex
Chronic alcohol induces circulating proinflammatory
cytokines in both animal models and in human pa￾tients [30, 31]. To determine whether this systemic
cytokine induction also occurs in the acute-on-chronic
model in mice, we measured circulating TNFα and
IL-6 in the serum (Fig. 2a). While alcohol did not
induce statistically significant increases in either cyto￾kine, antibiotic treatment significantly reduced circulat￾ing TNFα in both pair-fed and alcohol-fed mice
(Fig. 2a).
Chronic alcohol use results in neuroinflammation
both in humans and in mice [7, 12]. We found that
10 days of chronic alcohol feeding followed by a
one-time binge in mice, a model of acute-on-chronic
alcohol consumption not previously used to study
neuroinflammation, induced significantly higher ex￾pression of proinflammatory cytokine genes including
Mcp-1, Hmgb1, and Il-17 and non-significant trends
toward increased expression of Tnfα and Il-23 in the
brain cortex (Fig. 2b). Tnfα, Mcp-1, Hmgb1, Il-17, and
Il-23 are proinflammatory cytokines that can be re￾leased by multiple cell types, and each has previously
been associated with alcohol-induced neuroinflamma￾tion [9, 14, 32, 33]. Alcohol did not induce expression
of Il-6 or Cox2. Interestingly, Il-6 was induced in
pair-fed antibiotic-treated mice compared to
non-treated mice, and alcohol feeding reduced this in￾duction (Fig. 2b).
Previous studies indicate that antibiotic treatment that re￾duces intestinal bacterial load also reduces alcohol-induced
inflammation in the liver [23]. Here, we hypothesized that
translocation of gut bacterial products to the CNS contrib￾utes to alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and that this
process is regulated by the gut microbial load. Therefore,
we sought to investigate whether gut decontamination
could protect from neuroinflammation associated with alco￾hol consumption. We observed that the proinflammatory
cytokine expression increase in the cortex in alcohol-fed
mice compared to PF controls was markedly reduced in
mice treated with Abx (Fig. 2b). Antibiotic treatment fully
prevented alcohol-related induction of Mcp1, Il-17, and
Il-23 mRNA expression in the cortex. Tnfα was induced in
antibiotic-treated, alcohol-fed mice compared to
antibiotic-treated pair-fed mice, but its expression was still
significantly lower compared to alcohol-fed mice without
antibiotic treatment. Expression of Tnfα, Mcp1, Il-17, and
Il-23 was also reduced in the cortex of antibiotic-treated
pair-fed mice compared to those without antibiotic treat￾ment. These results indicate that acute-on-chronic alcohol
feeding in mice increases proinflammatory cytokine induc￾tion that is prevented by the reduction in gut-derived
PAMPs and the gut microbiome.
Cortical expression of inflammasome components
increase with bacterial decontamination
Because we found that multiple proinflammatory cytokines
were reduced in the cortex of antibiotic-treated mice
(Fig. 2), we next measured inflammasome-related tran￾scripts to elucidate if alcohol or antibiotics influenced
inflammasome-mediated cytokine expression. The inflam￾masome is a multiprotein complex containing NOD-like
receptors (NLRs, including NLRP3) that can sense patho￾gens and danger signals, the adaptor molecule, ASC, and
the effector molecule, caspase-1. Inflammasome activation
leads to cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their re￾spective bioactive forms, IL-1β and IL-18 [9]. We found
that although alcohol did not induce IL-1β, antibiotic treat￾ment increased circulating serum IL-1β in pair-fed mice (p
< 0.05) and trended toward an increase in alcohol-fed mice
(p = 0.055) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, although chronic alcohol
consumption models have led to increased expression of
inflammasome components and Il-1β [9], we found no
significant increase in alcohol-induced Il-1β mRNA
expression in this acute-on-chronic alcohol model (Fig. 3b).
However, cortical Il-1β mRNA expression in
antibiotic-treated pair-fed mice was significantly increased
and we observed an increasing trend in Il-1β in
antibiotic-treated alcohol-fed compared to untreated mice.
Interestingly, in antibiotic-treated mice, alcohol administra￾tion significantly increased Il-1β mRNA expression com￾pared to pair-fed mice. Expression of Il-18 was induced in
alcohol-fed mice in the cortex, and similar to the increase in
pair-fed Il-1β, we also found that Il-18 and Asc were elevated
in antibiotic-treated, PF mice compared to untreated PF mice
(Fig. 3b). Acute-on-chronic alcohol administration reduced
the expression of Nlrp3 and Asc and increased the expression
of Il-18 in untreated alcohol-fed mice compared to untreated
PF controls. Asc and Il-18 mRNA expression were reduced
in antibiotic-treated compared to untreated alcohol-fed mice
(Fig. 3b). Caspase-1 mRNA levels did not change signifi￾cantly in any of the treatment groups (Fig. 3b). These obser￾vations suggest that regulation of the inflammasome and
IL-1β depends on the gut microbiome and is minimally in￾fluenced in the acute-on-chronic alcohol model in mice.
Gut decontamination alters cortical and hippocampal
microglia
To characterize the effects of the acute-on-chronic alcohol
model in the CNS, we next examined the microglia activa￾tion. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the CNS
capable of expressing proinflammatory cytokines in re￾sponse to an insult, such as alcohol [34]. Activated micro￾glia are characterized by altered cell morphology, taking
on an amoeboid shape with enlarged cell bodies (soma)
and shortened peripheral processes [35]. We used immu￾nohistochemistry to identify IBA1-positive microglia (rep￾resentative images shown in Fig. 4a, b). The soma size and
Lowe et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2018) 15:298 Page 5 of 12

length of cell extensions off the soma were measured in
the cortical and hippocampal microglia in all treatment
groups and normalized to PF mice. No significant differ￾ences in soma size were observed in the cortex (Fig. 4c).
Investigation of the sub-regions of the hippocampus, such
as the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) areas, revealed
that alcohol increased the soma area only in the microglia
of the CA3 region. There was no change in the soma area
for CA3 microglia in EtOH-fed mice compared to PF con￾trols that were both treated with antibiotics (Fig. 4d).
Importantly, we found that alcohol reduced the total
process length compared to pair-fed mice in the cortex
(Fig. 4e), consistent with the condensed cell morphology
characteristic of microglial activation [35]. Antibiotic
treatment eliminated this alcohol-induced reduction in
process length in cortical microglia. Hippocampal micro￾glia process length in alcohol-fed mice was significantly
reduced compared to pair-fed controls in all regions inves￾tigated, and as in the cortex, antibiotic treatment elimi￾nated this morphological change (Fig. 4f). The number of

microglia in the cortex was not changed in EtOH-fed
compared to PF mice in either treatment group, although
antibiotic treatment in PF mice modestly reduced the
number of cortical microglia compared to untreated PF
mice (Fig. 4g). There was no change in microglial num￾bers in the hippocampus (Fig. 4h).
Alcohol-induced cytokine expression in the small
intestine is attenuated by antibiotic administration
The alcohol-induced changes we observed in the brain
could be due to a loss of integrity of the gut barrier. Previ￾ous studies have shown that intestinal cytokine expression
can reduce gut barrier integrity and may allow leakage of
pathogen-associated molecules from the intestinal lumen
into the systemic circulation [36]. Therefore, we measured
the intestinal expression of various proinflammatory cyto￾kines and found that they were increased after the
acute-on-chronic alcohol administration compared to
calorie-matched pair-fed mice (Fig. 5a). The expression of
Tnfα, Mcp1, and Hmgb1 mRNA was significantly increased
in the small intestine following alcohol consumption, and
Il-17 and Il-23 expression also showed an increasing trend
in EtOH mice. Treatment with the antibiotic cocktail re￾duced the bacterial load in the intestine (Fig. 1) and led to
significantly attenuated alcohol-induced Mcp1 and Hmgb1
mRNA levels. Antibiotic treatment reduced the baseline ex￾pression of the inflammatory cytokines including Tnfα,
Il-17, and Il-23 in PF mice compared to untreated PF mice
(Fig. 5a). Interestingly, even with antibiotic treatment, alco￾hol feeding still increased the expression of Tnfα, Il-17, and
Il-23 in the small intestine of antibiotic-treated alcohol-fed
mice compared to antibiotic-treated pair-fed mice (Fig. 5a).
Recent research has highlighted an important connec￾tion between the intestinal microbiome and inflamma￾somes [37], particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome [38].
Therefore, we investigated whether antibiotic decontamin￾ation of the gut impacted the expression of inflammasome
components in the small intestine. Alcohol induced

expression of Il-1β, Nlrp3, and Asc compared to pair-fed
controls (Fig. 5b). Antibiotic treatment abrogated the alco￾hol induction of Il-1β, Nlrp3, and Asc, and antibiotics also
increased the baseline expression in pair-fed mice of Il-1β,
Il-18, Asc, and Casp1 (Fig. 5b).
Discussion
In this study, we show that acute-on-chronic alcohol ad￾ministration results in the central nervous system and
small intestinal inflammation and that reducing the gut
microbial load with antibiotics protects against
alcohol-induced neuroinflammation. The cocktail of oral
antibiotics dramatically reduced the gut bacterial load and
circulating endotoxin levels. Alcohol-induced neuroin￾flammation, including microglial morphologic changes
and proinflammatory gene expression, was significantly at￾tenuated in oral antibiotic-treated mice, providing novel
evidence for the importance of gut bacterial load and
PAMPs in the gut-brain axis in alcohol use. We also
describe increased proinflammatory cytokine expression
in the small intestine after alcohol consumption that can
be reduced by treatment with intragastric antibiotics that
drastically reduced the bacterial load in the intestine.
Interestingly, reduction in the gut microbiome was associ￾ated with increased expression of inflammasome compo￾nents in both the CNS and intestine.
Previously, we have shown that antibiotic treatment
in the acute-on-chronic alcohol model protects the
liver from alcohol-induced inflammation (including
cytokine expression), immune cell infiltration, and
steatosis [23]. In the present study, we found evidence
of microglial activation by acute-on-chronic alcohol
administration in mice. CNS proinflammatory cytokine
expression was increased, and average cell process
length was decreased in EtOH mice indicating micro￾glia activation. Activated microglia take on an
amoeboid-like morphology with reduced process length
and, typically, an increased soma size [35].

Acute-on-chronic alcohol reduced cell process length in
both the cortex and hippocampus and significantly in￾creased the soma size in part of the hippocampus. Inter￾estingly, although acute-on-chronic alcohol-induced
proinflammatory cytokine expression in the CNS, alcohol
feeding did not increase circulating levels of TNFα, IL-6,
and IL-1β. This indicates that alcohol-induced neuroin￾flammation may occur independent of systemic inflamma￾tion, although further investigation of other peripheral
signals will be necessary to rule out contributions from
circulating factors.
Similar to observations in the liver [23], antibiotic gut
decontamination protected the CNS from proinflamma￾tory gene expression and changes in the resident macro￾phage population. Interestingly, germ-free mice do not
show the same protection from alcohol-induced liver
damage that we have previously described using anti￾biotic decontamination [39]. A possible explanation for
these different observations is that some baseline bacter￾ial load and/or presence of bacteria during development
is critical for the alcohol-induced response of the im￾mune system as well as for organ-specific immunity.
Fig. 5 Alcohol-induced small intestinal inflammation is reduced with gut bacterial load reduction. a Expression of proinflammatory cytokines Tnfα,
Mcp1, Hmgb1, Il-17, and Il-23 was measured from the small intestine of pair-fed (PF) or alcohol-fed (EtOH) mice with or without daily antibiotic
treatment (Abx). b Expression of inflammasome components Nlrp3, Asc, and Casp1 as well as the cytokines Il-1β and Il-18 were measured by
qPCR. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 5–10 mice/group. *p < 0.05

Indeed, previous research has highlighted a role for anti￾biotic treatment during development in affecting the
function of adaptive immune cells [40]. Although mul￾tiple studies demonstrated alcohol-induced neuroinflam￾mation after chronic, prolonged alcohol administration
in mice and rats, here, we show that a 10-day alcohol
feeding followed by an acute binge also results in
alcohol-related neuroinflammation. Furthermore, this
NIAAA model of alcohol administration results in com￾mon end-organ effects of inflammation on the brain,
small intestine and liver.
Our data are consistent with previous studies examin￾ing the role of TLR4 signaling in alcohol-related organ
pathology. While some have suggested that alcohol may
interact directly with TLR4 or affect lipid membrane in￾teractions required for proper TLR4 signal transduction
[41, 42], TLR4 also recognizes endogenous (including
HMGB1) [17, 18] and exogenous (i.e., bacterial compo￾nents such as LPS) [19] danger signals. Studies show
that TLR4 knockout and knockdown mice are protected
from numerous inflammation-related sequelae of alcohol
exposure in the liver [43] and in the brain [14–16]. Ra￾ther than focusing on TLR4 and its signaling pathway,
we used antibiotics to reduce bacterial LPS, one of the
prominent ligands of TLR4, and reveal a similar reduc￾tion in tissue inflammation from the gut to the brain.
Our study adds critical evidence to the understanding of
the gut-brain axis that relates multifocal pathology in
the body after chronic alcohol exposure.
An important remaining question is whether gut bacteria
or their products are primarily responsible for organ dam￾age. A direct link between LPS and organ inflammation is
possible; leakage of live or dead bacteria or bacterial-derived
products into the systemic circulation has been documented
in various alcohol administration settings [1, 2, 44, 45].
These bacterial signals could be directly responsible for in￾ducing inflammation in the gut and in the brain, as well as
the associated organ damage. Although LPS does not cross
the blood-brain barrier at significant levels [20], it could be
interacting with juxta-cerebrovascular cells to transmit an
immune signal across the barrier. Evidence of blood-brain
barrier disruption in alcohol models and human patients
provides another explanation for a possible direct mechan￾ism of LPS-induced neuroinflammation [46]. Alternatively,
gut-derived signals, such as LPS, bacterial metabolites, or
other undescribed intestinal signals, could lead to a systemic
reaction. This reaction could include inflammatory cytokines
or activated immune cells in the liver or in the circulation
that then induce organ-specific inflammation in the CNS
and elsewhere in the body. In the present study, we did not
detect alcohol-induced increases in circulating TNFα, IL-6,
or IL-1β which suggests that alcohol-induced neuroinflam￾mation can be induced by alcohol in the absence of systemic
cytokine increases. Developing models to investigate
possible peripheral signaling to the CNS leading to neuroin￾flammation will be a critical area of further study to explain
inter-organ communication after alcohol consumption.
Our data supports previous studies showing that alco￾hol can induce inflammatory signaling in the intestine.
This inflammation may be a key factor in the breakdown
of the intestinal barrier integrity and ensuing leakage of
bacterial products into the circulation associated with al￾cohol. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, Al-Sadi et
al. have shown that proinflammatory cytokines are cap￾able of reducing tight junctions and gut barrier integrity,
leading to breakdown and molecule translocation across
the gastrointestinal tract [47–49]. Other mechanisms of
alcohol-induced loss of intestinal barrier integrity have
been explored and include bacterial dysbiosis [50, 51],
luminal homeostasis [45, 52], enterocyte cellular stress,
and dysregulation of structural proteins [53]. Further￾more, the relationship between proinflammatory gene
expression and gut barrier dysfunction appears to be
critical [36, 54], and our data further emphasize the role
of alcohol and intestinal bacteria in regulating intestinal
cytokine levels.
Conclusion
Our study shows for the first time that acute-on-chronic
alcohol induces neuroinflammation and small intestinal
proinflammatory cytokine expression. Reducing the gut
bacterial load with oral antibiotics protects mice from
proinflammatory cytokine expression in the CNS and
small intestine and highlights critical connections be￾tween intestinal microbiome and the gut-brain axis fol￾lowing alcohol consumption.
