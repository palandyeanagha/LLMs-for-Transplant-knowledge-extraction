Prominent role of platelets in the formation of
circulating neutrophil-red cell heterocellular
aggregates in sickle cell anemia
High leukocyte counts are often observed in sickle cell
anemia (SCA) and are associated with increased clinical
severity. In vivo animal model studies indicate that the
adhesion of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, to the ves￾sel wall may promote subsequent secondary red blood cell
(RBC) recruitment, in turn triggering the initiation of the
vaso-occlusive process.
1-3 While circulating neutrophil￾platelet aggregates are well documented in inflammatory
conditions such as sepsis, atherosclerosis and SCA,
4-6 in
which they are thought to augment tissue injury,
1,6 the for￾mation of leukocyte-RBC aggregates in humans has not
been well studied. Circulating RBC-mononuclear cell
aggregates have been reported in sickle cell disease (SCD),
while the capture of SCD RBC by adherent leukocytes has
been observed in vitro.
7-9 However, the existence of circulat￾ing neutrophil-RBC aggregates has, to our knowledge, yet
to be described in humans, even in inflammatory settings.
A total of 28 SCA patients in steady state, receiving HU
(SCAHU; 15-30 mg/kg/day) or not, were recruited to the

CD66b-positive neutrophils were acquired as single cells
and aggregates (~6000 events); images (40x objective) were
taken and data were analyzed using IDEAS 6.0 software.
We found that the formation of neutrophil-RBC
(CD66b+
/CD235a+
) aggregates was significantly augment￾ed in SCA patients (Figure 1A and C) compared to healthy
individuals. As there was no significant difference in the
percentage of neutrophils aggregated to RBC between SCA
patient (10.3±1.5%; n=9) and SCAHU patient (12.4±2.3%;
n=14; P>0.05) groups, for subsequent analyses, SCA data
were grouped together (SCA and SCAHU). To our knowl￾edge, whilst circulating platelet-RBC and mononuclear cell￾RBC aggregates
8,10 have been previously described in SCD,
this is the first description of the formation of neutrophil￾RBC aggregates in blood from human SCA subjects.
Immature RBCs, or reticulocytes (CD235a+
CD71+
) rather
than mature RBCs (CD235a+
CD71–
) were the dominant
type of RBC involved in SCA neutrophil-RBC aggregates
(Figure 1B and C). Although reticulocyte counts are quite
high in SCA (Table 1), reticulocyte numbers in these
patients did not correlate with the percentage of neu￾trophil-reticulocyte aggregates (Figure 1D), suggesting that
the presence of reticulocytosis per se is not a determining
factor for neutrophil-reticulocyte aggregate formation in
SCA, but rather alterations in these reticulocytes may cause
these interactions. In contrast, the number of neutrophil￾RBC aggregates, especially neutrophil-reticulocyte aggre￾gates, correlated inversely with the level of fetal hemoglo￾bin (HbF) (Figure 1E) which is known to inhibit polymer￾ization of HbS. This decrease in HbS polymerization may
prevent some of the alterations in RBC that lead to aggre￾gate formation.
The leukocyte surface expressions of the adhesion mole￾cule components CD11a (Mac-1 integrin subunit) and
CD11b (LFA-1 integrin subunit) and the CD66b activation
marker were verified on SCA and control individual neu￾trophil-RBC aggregates (representative images shown in
Figure 2A); however, no significant differences in the sur￾face expressions of these molecules were observed on the
neutrophils of the control and SCA groups (data not shown).
In contrast, function-inhibiting antibody experiments indi￾cated a participation of the neutrophil Mac-1 integrin in
neutrophil-RBC aggregates (Figure 2B and C). Integrins can
exist in low- and high-affinity states
11 and, based on our
data, it is probable that changes in integrin affinity, or avid￾ity, rather than expression are responsible for the increased
heterocellular leukocyte aggregates observed in SCA.
Function-blocking assays also indicated the participation of
the VLA-4 integrin on reticulocytes (CD235a+
CD71+
)
(Figure 2B) and of ICAM-4 expressed on mature RBCs
(CD235a+
CD71–
) (Figure 2C) in SCA neutrophil-RBC aggre￾gate formation, in agreement with previous studies investi￾gating leukocyte interactions.
1 A non-specific IgG1 anti￾body also reduced the incidence of aggregates, albeit to a
lesser degree, compared to baseline, consistent with reports
that intravenous IgG administration in sickle mice reduces
neutrophil and erythrocyte interactions and improves
microcirculatory blood flow.
2
Intriguingly, we observed a positive correlation between
platelet counts and neutrophil-reticulocyte aggregates in
SCA (Figure 1F) and we therefore investigated a possible
role for platelets in aggregate formation. Figure 3A-C
demonstrates that the incubation of SCA granulocyte sus￾pensions with a P-selectin-blocking antibody significantly
reduced the number of total neutrophil-RBC aggregates, as
well as neutrophil-reticulocyte aggregates. Furthermore,
analysis by flow cytometry of fluorescently-labeled SCA
neutrophil-RBC aggregates that had been concomitantly
labeled with anti-CD62P demonstrated that activated
platelets participated in the formation of approximately
20% of total neutrophil-RBC aggregates (Figure 3D) and
50% of neutrophil-reticulocyte aggregates (Figure 3E),
while 20% of all neutrophil-mature RBC aggregates were
CD62P-positive (Figure 3F), indicating the formation of ter￾nary complexes. The corresponding images of these aggre￾gates demonstrated a prominent role of platelets in these
heterocellular complexes, apparently forming a bridge
between the neutrophil and the erythrocyte/reticulocyte in
the majority of aggregates (Figure 3G). In other images,
platelets were observed adhered just to neutrophils, which
in turn formed heterocellular interactions with RBCs, con￾sistent with a previous in vitro report demonstrating that
platelet-bound monocytes are more likely to interact with
reticulocytes.
7
It was somewhat surprising that, while fetal hemoglobin
levels correlated negatively with neutrophil-RBC aggregate
formation in SCA, no significant alteration in the incidence
of neutrophil-RBC aggregates was found in the blood of
SCA patients on therapy with HU, compared to SCA
patients not on HU. Additional experiments carried out in
another population of steady-state SCA patients in Brazil
demonstrated a similar lack of difference in neutrophil-RBC
aggregate formation in aged-matched patients on and off
HU therapy (data not shown). These results might reflect
confounding factors by indication, whereby patients with
the most severe clinical symptoms of SCA are selectively
prescribed HU therapy, while those patients with milder
symptoms are often not treated with HU. Alternatively, a
lack of significant alterations with HU treatment in some
platelet-related parameters has been observed in some
recent studies.
12,13 Importantly, data provided in Table 1
indicate that, in our study population, the platelet counts of
the patients that were on HU were not significantly differ￾ent to those of patients not on HU. Given the prominent
role that platelets appear to play in the formation of these
aggregates it may be that the number of platelets and neu￾trophils and their activation state may be more crucial to
the formation of neutrophil-RBC aggregates in the circula￾tion than red cell fetal hemoglobin content. Longitudinal
studies would be required to determine whether HU ther￾apy has no real effect on the formation of these aggregates.
In summary, we report a significant capacity for neu￾trophils to form heterocellular aggregates with red cells,

particularly reticulocytes, in the circulation of SCA individ￾uals; furthermore, a key role for platelets in the formation
of these aggregates is suggested. Although our in vitro data
do not establish whether these complexes circulate in such
high numbers in vivo or contribute directly to vaso-occlu￾sion, it is feasible to conclude, based on in vivo data from
sickle mouse models,
1,3,6 that these aggregates may be
formed in the circulation of SCA individuals and at sites of
low flow conditions. Given the evidence for the significant
destructive effects of such heterocellular aggregates and the
initiating role that RBC-neutrophil interactions may have in
the vaso-occlusive process, we suggest that the formation
of these heterocellular aggregates may contribute to vascu￾lar inflammation and occlusion with potentially damaging
consequences. Thus, approaches to reduce the activity of
platelets (such as the potent oral P-selectin-blocking agent
and small molecule selectin inhibitor
14,15 that are currently
undergoing clinical trials) and to reduce leukocyte Mac-1
integrin activation could be valuable resources for reducing
heterocellular interactions.
