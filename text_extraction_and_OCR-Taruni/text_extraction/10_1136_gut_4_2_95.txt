The aetiology and management of ascites in patients
with hepatic cirrhosis: A review
SHEILA SHERLOCK AND STANLEY SHALDON
From the Department of Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, London
Ascites, if associated with parenchymatous liver
disease, implies hepato-cellular failure and portal
venous hypertension. The commonest cause is
Laennec's cirrhosis. Less often it complicates ter￾minal biliary cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, hepato￾lenticular degeneration, or acute virus hepatitis.
AETIOLOGY
Starling (1896) suggested that the interchange of
fluid between the blood and the tissue spaces is con￾trolled by the balance between the capillary blood
pressure, forcing fluid into the tissue spaces, and the
osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins, retaining
fluid in the vascular compartment (Fig. 1). The
equilibrium may be stated as:-

FIG. 1. The ascitic fluid is separated from the capillary
lumen by the peritoneal membrane and the portal capillary
wall. The forces keeping fluid in the capillaries are the
colloid osmotic pressure of the serum (S.C.O.P.) and the
hydrostatic pressure of the ascitic fluid (A.F.P.). The
forces tending to form ascites are the portal capillary
pressure (P.C.P.) and the colloid osmotic pressure of the
ascitic fluid (A.C.O.P.). In a steady state these forces
should balance.
Plasma colloid osmotic pressure - Ascitic colloid
osmotic pressure
= Portal capillary pressure - intra-abdominal
hydrostatic pressure
'It 'is clear therefore that there are probably at
least two important factors in the formation of
ascites, namely, the plasma colloid osmotic pressure
and the portal venous pressure.
PLASMA COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURE The plasma
colloid osmotic pressure is largely governed by the
plasma albumin level. In cirrhotic patients albumin
turnover rates are decreased reflecting impaired
synthesis (Wilkinson and Mendenhall, 1963).
Plasma albumin levels are low and hence colloid
osmotic pressure is reduced. It has been suggested
that oedema is formed when the plasma albumin
level falls below 3 1 g. per 100 ml. or 270 cm. water
colloid osmotic pressure (Post and Patek, 1942;
Bj0rneboe, Brun, and Raaschou, 1949). This relation￾ship is, however, by no means constant, and con￾siderable overlap in the range of serum albumin or
colloid osmotic pressure levels may be found in
patients with liver disease with and without ascites
(Higgins, Kelsall, O'Brien, Stewart, and Witts,
1947); Giges and Kunkel, 1954). Moreover, if a
normal serum colloid osmotic pressure is main￾tained by intravenous albumin infusions oedema
does not always resolve (Faloon, Eckhardt, Murphy,
Cooper, and Davidson, 1949; Losowski and Atkin￾son, 1961). It is important, furthermore. to stress
that the measurement of the serum albumin in a
patient with established fluid retention does not
necessarily reflect the level of serum albumin at the
time of the development of fluid retention. The
possibility of ascites developing in the presence of
a normal serum albumin level with the subsequent
dilution of the albumin in a larger pool is suggested
by the presence of a normal total body albumin
level in patients with cirrhosis with ascites and low
serum albumin concentrations (Wilkinson and
Mendenhall, 1963).
However, when all four components of the Starling
formula are measured the effective colloid osmotic

pressure still provides a better dividing line between
those patients with and without ascites than does
the effective portal pressure (Cherrick, Kerr, Read,
and Sherlock, 1960).
PORTAL VENOUS PRESSURE When considered as an
isolated phenomenon, portal pressure cannot be
quantitatively related to the presence of ascites. For
instance, portal hypertension due to cirrhosis may
exist in the absence as well as in the presence of
ascites. Experimental obstruction to the portal vein
is rarely sufficient to produce ascites unless at the
same time the animal is rendered hypoproteinaemic
by plasmapheresis (Bolton, 1914; Berman and Hull,
1952). Similarly, if a patient with extrahepatic portal
hypertension suffers a gastrointestinal haemorrhage,
or if for any other reason the plasma protein level
falls, then ascites may develop. The disappearance
of ascites is associated with an increase in the con￾centration of the plasma proteins, even though portal
hypertension remains. Portal hypertension serves to
localize fluid retention in the peritoneal cavity rather
than in the peripheral tissues.
PLASMA-ASCITES INTERCHANGE Fluid exchange be￾tween the ascitic and vascular compartments is
mainly through the visceral peritoneum; the role of
the lymphatics will be considered later. Once formed,
ascitic fluid can exchange with blood through an
enormous capillary bed under the visceral peri￾toneum. The net transfer pressure is the sum of
known hydrostatic forces controlling fluid transfer
across the membrane, assuming that it is a simple
semipermeable one. The net transfer is usually
positive in those forming ascites and usually, but not
constantly, negative in those without ascites (Cher￾rick et al., 1960). The association of a positive trans￾fer pressure favouring the formation of ascites at a
time when it is absent might indicate that the capil￾lary peritoneal membrane is actively preventing
transfer of fluid and is playing a dynamic vital role.
Again a strongly positive transfer pressure in patients
with ascites who are not rapidly accumulating fluid,
but indeed may be losing it, might indicate that the
fluid is maintained in the portal capillaries against a
head of pressure by the activity of this living capillary
peritoneal membrane. Alternatively, the fluid might
be continually removed by the lymphatics. A further
and hitherto uninvestigated factor is the rate of
blood flow along the capillary membrane where
fluid exchange occurs, as undoubtedly the rate of
formation and reabsorption of ascitic fluid will be
determined to some extent by the volume velocity
of the fluid bathing the capillary surface. The
mechanism by which patients with ascites maintain
a steady state when formation equals reabsorption
is not known.
Ascites is continually circulating and has a half
turnover time of about one hour (Schoenberger,
Kroll, Sakamoto, and Kark, 1952). The constituents
of the fluid are in a dynamic equilibrium with those
of the plasma.
THE ROLE OF LYMPH FLOW Ascites can be produced
in a dog by constriction of the inferior vena cava
above the entry of the hepatic vein, so causing
hepatic congestion (Bolton, 1914). This is associated
with an increased production of hepatic lymph which
then extravasates through the capsule into the peri￾toneal cavity (Volwiler, Grindlay, and Bollman,
1950; Hyatt and Smith, 1954). In hepatic cirrhosis
the obstruction to portal blood flow is post-sinu￾soidal (Shaldon, Dolle, Guevara, Iber, and Sherlock,
1961), presumably secondary to scarring and pressure
of regenerating nodules on the hepatic veins. This
outflow 'block' is believed to cause an increased
production of hepatic lymph (McDermott, 1958;
Welch, Welch, and Carter, 1959). In experimental
cirrhosis hepatic lymph flow is certainly increased
(Cain, Grindley, Bollman, Flock, and Mann, 1947).
In cirrhotic patients the thoracic duct is dilated and
flow through it is increased three- to six-fold; ascites
has been relieved by cannulating the thoracic duct
and draining lymph (Dumont and Mulholland, 1960).
The numbers of subcapsular and hilar lymphatics
are increased in patients with ascites (Baggenstoss
and Cain, 1957; Leger and Guyet, 1957). Ascites
disappears if hepatic outflow 'block' is relieved by
side-to-side portacaval anastomosis (McDermott,
1958; Welch et al., 1959). Ascites might therefore be
produced from hepatic lymph and carried away in
the hepatic lymph channels to the thoracic duct.
This could account, in part, for difficulties in inter￾preting the mechanism of ascites formation simply
by the Starling equilibrium. The reabsorption into
the lymphatics, in contrast to the diffusion into the
capillaries, is not selective: all protein fractions are
carried away equally (Dykes, 1961).
This theory does not explain the development of
ascites in patients with extrahepatic portal obstruc￾tion who become hypoproteinaemic, the relief of
ascites obtained by end-to-side portacaval anasto￾mosis (with no obvious relief of the hepatic outflow
'block'), or the close relationship found between
serum colloid osmotic pressure and the presence
of ascites.

The aetiology and management of ascites in patients with hepatic cirrhosis: A review
(Eisenmenger, 1952) and often less than I mEq. is
excreted daily in the urine. Such low sodium excre￾tion is not confined to the urine, being also found in
sweat, saliva, and even colonic secretions (Bongio￾vanni and Eisenmenger, 1951). Serum sodium levels
are also lower than normal, usually about 130 mEq.
per litre (Eisenmenger, 1952). This does not reflect
sodium deficiency, as the greatly expanded extra￾cellular sodium space results in an actual increase
in total body stores of sodium (Birkenfeld, Leibman,
O'Meara, and Edelman, 1958).
Sodium retention results from tubular reabsorp￾tion of sodium to an almost quantitative degree.
Most sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule
and the mechanism for this excessive reabsorption
in patients with fluid retention is unknown, although
recently a humoral factor has been postulated (de
Wardener, Mills, Clapham, and Hayter, 1961; Mills,
de Wardener, Hayter, and Clapham, 1961). Distal
tubular reabsorption of sodium is partly controlled
by aldosterone and increased secretion rates of
aldosterone from the adrenals has been shown in
cirrhotic patients with ascites (Ulick, 1959). Un￾doubtedly, aldosterone alone cannot be responsible
for sodium retention to the degree seen in cases of
cirrhosis with ascites, as completely suppressing the
production of aldosterone by an 1lI hydroxylase
inhibitor (Metopirone) fails to produce a sodium
diuresis when it is given alone (Shaldon and
McLaren, 1960), nor is the administration of a peri￾pheral aldosterone antagonist alone (spironolactone)
usually effective in producing a sodium diuresis in
patients with ascites (Shaldon, McLaren, and
Sherlock, 1960).
WATER RETENTION Patients with cirrhosis have an
impaired water excretion (Birchard, Prout, Williams,
and Rosenbaum, 1956). This might be due to the
activity of antidiuretic hormone, increased amounts
of which can be found in jugular venous blood of
some patients with cirrhosis forming ascites (Lee and
Bisset, 1958). Both the pitressin tolerance test and
the nicotine test, which depends on endogenous
production of antidiuretic hormone are, however,
normal in cirrhosis (Bernstein, Weston, Ross,
Grossman, Hanenson, and Leiter, 1953). We have
recently observed the formation of ascites in a
patient with cirrhosis and coexistent nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus secondary to potassium depletion.
In this patient the administration of antidiuretic
hormone had no effect on free water clearance or
urinary osmolality.
Most probably the defect in water excretion
results from proximal tubular reabsorption of
sodium being so great that reducted amounts pass
to the distal tubule and so 'free water' cannot be
generated in adequate amounts (Schedl and Bartter,
1960). It can be remedied by giving an osmotic
diuretic such as Mannitol which flushes sodium
distally and so allows free water to be generated
(Shaldon et al., 1960).
POTASSIUM CHANGES The serum potassium level is
normal or slightly depressed but the body's exchange￾able potassium is decreased (Birkenfeld et al., 1958).
This is not only due to excessive loss of the ion but
to the cells failing to maintain their potassium con￾tent (cellular depletion) (De Deuxchaisnes, Collet,
Busset, and Mach, 1961). Reduction in total muscle
mass is also a contributory factor.
RENAL FUNCTION
The relationship of sodium excretion to renal blood
flow and the glomerular filtration rate is poorly
understood. Undoubtedly, reductions in the glome￾rular filtration rate may result in sodium retention,
although in the presence of chronic renal disease or
hypertension reduction of the glomerular filtration
rate is often associated with a sodium diuresis. In
patients with cirrhosis and ascites renal blood flow
and the glomerular filtration rate are often normal
or slightly reduced (Papper, Belsky, and Bleifer,
1959; Gornel, Lancestremere, Papper, and Lowen￾stein, 1962). However, where ascites is tense, in￾increased abdominal pressure acting on the renal
veins may reduce renal blood flow (Bradley and
Bradley, 1947).
In terminal liver disease marked reduction of the
glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow may
produce a syndrome of uraemia and renal failure
with avid sodium retention (Shaldon and Walker,
1962). Measurement of renal blood flow by the
para-amino-hippuric acid clearance technique is
invalid under the circumstances as the extraction of
para-amino-hippuric acid by the kidney is very poor,
and so doubts are cast on the excessively low renal
blood flow figures previously reported using this
method (Papper et al., 1959; Lancestremere,
Davidson, Earley, O'Brien, and Papper, 1962).
However, studies with a nitrous oxide technique
measuring renal blood flow suggest that there is
indeed a marked reduction in oliguric patients with
cirrhosis of the liver (Tyler, Jeffries, and Wilder,
1962) and, more recently, these results have been
confirmed using a method of measuring renal blood
flow which is independent of renal function (Shaldon,
Higgs, Chiandussi, Walker, Garsenstein, and Ryder,
1962). The relationship between diuretic therapy
and the reduction in renal blood flow and the
glomerular filtration rate will be considered later.

AETIOLOGICAL CONCLUSIONS
The two most important factors in the development
of ascites are failure of the liver to synthesize albu￾min, resulting in a low plasma osmotic,pressure and
portal venous hypertension. More fluid enters the
peritoneal cavity than leaves it and ascites develops,
resulting in a depletion of the effective body fluids
and causing the renal tubules to reabsorb sodium
excessively. The distal tubular effect is mediated
through aldosterone; the mechanism of the proximal
tubular action remains uncertain. In some instances
renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate
may be reduced, adding to sodium retention. It is
possible that the peritoneal capillary membrane
plays an active role in controlling the passage of
fluid. Ascites may be partly formed from the
hepatic lymph and the thoracic duct may play a part
in its removal. By these various compensations body
fluids are again depleted, more ascites is formed, and
the whole cycle starts again.
TREATMENT
DIETARY The mainstay of the successful control of
ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is rigid dietary therapy.
In the past three years we have seen 87 patients with
cirrhosis and fluid retention. Before the patients'
referral for treatment the ascites was said to be
intractable or 'resistant', unresponsive to diuretic
therapy, and requiring repeated abdominal para￾FIG. 2. Schematic summary
of the pathogenesis of ascites.
centesis. In 42 patients, the only change in treatment
was to add a rigid restriction of salt to the previous
dietary regime, allow-ing only 10 to 22 mEq. (0 25-
0 5 g. sodium daily), and diuresis ensued. With such
a rigid diet, ascites occasionally resolved without
diuretic therapy. Others have commented on the
need, in spite of the use of newer available diuretics,
for rigid dietary sodium restriction to control ascites
(Summerskill, Clowdus, and Rosevear, 1961;
Chalmers and Morrison, 1961). In a severe case even
combinations of diuretics in large doses cannot
compensate for a high-sodium diet. Potassium sup￾plements are given routinely not only to combat the
potassium depletion which is invariably present in
patients forming ascites but also to prevent sodium
depletion following diuretic therapy, especially with
the thiazide group (Read, Haslam, Laidlaw, and
Sherlock, 1958) and even with the aldosterone
antagonists (Ross, 1961). Potassium supplements also
have a diuretic potentiating action in their own right
(Taylor and Faloon, 1959). Potassium supplements
are most easily administered as an effervescent tablet
containing 6-5 mEq. of potassium (potassium
bicarbonate 500 mg. and potassium acid tartrate
300 mg.); each tablet is equivalent to 0-5 g. potassium
chloride (Hadgraft, 1960). Four tablets, dissolved in
as little as 30 ml. of water, are taken four times
daily, giving 104 mEq. potassium. This is the
minimum routine daily dose. If azotaemia is present
this quantity should be reduced or else serious
hyperkalaemia may be produced. Gastrointestinal

disturbances are very rare. Chandler, Hetherington,
Stephenson, and Atkinson (1961) reported difficulty
with this preparation due to potassium sticking to
the glass after adding water; this has not been our
experience with tablets prepared according to the
original specification (Hadgraft, 1960).
Fluid intake is not usually restricted during the
treatment of ascites. Retention of water is, however,
sometimes important in the development of hypona￾traemia in these patients. When this occurs, although
an excess of both sodium and water is present in the
body, retention of water is relatively greater than
that of salt (Clowdus, Summerskill, Casey, Higgins,
and Orvis, 1961). If cerebral symptoms suggestive of
water intoxication are associated with a severe
hyponatraemia, then it may be wise to restrict water,
but if the hyponatraemia is asymptomatic this is not
necessary. The demonstrable excess of total body
sodium in the presence of hyponatraemia and the
presence of a reduced total body potassium in the
presence of hyperkalaemia clearly indicate the small
value which may be placed on serum concentrations
as indicative of changes in the total body content of
electrolytes. There is no place for salt replacement
therapy in the treatment of hyponatraemia associated
with ascites and cirrhosis (Hecker and Sherlock,
1956). The administration of intravenous sodium to
such a patient merely results in an increase in the
ascitic fluid and, in the severely ill, in pulmonary
oedema and death.
A good protein intake plays an important part in
the rehabilitation process following the effective
control of ascites. If the patient will tolerate an
80 g. protein diet this is desirable. The danger of
precipitating hepatic coma in patients on a high￾protein diet must be realized (Sherlock, Summer￾skill, White, and Phear, 1954), and they will respond
just as adequately to diuretic therapy on low-protein
diets, although the rate of tissue protein accretion
is slowed down. In certain instances, 4 g. neomycin
daily by mouth will allow a higher protein intake
without precipitating hepatic coma (Sherlock,
Summerskill, and Dawson, 1956).
DIURETIC AGENTS In the past few years, two potent
groups of diuretic agents, the thiazides and the aldo￾sterone antagonists, have been added to the long￾used mercurial group. The different modes of action
of each group and their additive effects have virtually
eliminated the problem of refractory ascites (Fig. 3).
However, complications of vigorous diuretic therapy
may be serious and the need for long-term treatment
in previously refractory cases has only recently been
appreciated. Careful management and close super￾vision of such patients is necessary if the palliative
value of the diuretic control of ascites is to be con￾CIRRHOSIS WITH ASCITES

verted into a significant improvement in prognosis
for the patient with 'resistant ascites'.
Chlorothiazide is the drug of choice for initial use,
provided adequate potassium supplements are given.
The main complication of this diuretic is potassium
depletion and the newer thiazide diuretics have this
same effect (Kerr, Read, and Sherlock, 1959).
Chlorothiazide also causes an elevation of the serum
uric acid level (Monroe, Grant, Sasahara, and
Littman, 1959) and this has been confirmed in our
cirrhotic patients on long-term thiazide therapy,
although there have been no overt attacks of gout
in any patient. In patients with hypertension, how￾ever, acute gouty arthritis has been precipitated by
thiazide treatment (Aronoff and Barkum, 1961).
Disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism with the
exacerbation of diabetes and the production of hyper￾glycaemia has been reported in patients receiving
thiazide for hypertension (Shapiro, Benedek, and
Small, 1961) associated with possible pancreatic
damage (Shanklin, 1962), and we have observed a
patient developing acute pancreatitis while on long￾term thiazide treatment. Agranulocytosis in associa￾tion with thiazide therapy has been reported (Chrein
and Rubin, 1962), probably due to the sulphonamide
chemical structure of thiazide diuretics. Chloro￾thiazide also exhibits some carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor activity resulting in an increase in the
concentration of ammonia in the renal vein and a
reduction in urinary ammonia excretion (Owen,
Flanagan, and Tyor, 1959). The resultant rise in the
blood ammonia level is clearly undesirable in patients
with cirrhosis. Later thiazide analogues have less
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor activity (Beyer and
Baer, 1961). One such analogue, Quinethazonel,

seems to have an equivalent diuretic potency to
chlorothiazide without the undesirable shift of
ammonia from the urine to the renal vein (Shaldon,
Walker, Ryder, Lawson, and Silva, 1963).
Chlorothiazide should be given every day in a
dose of 2 g. until the ascites is controlled. A more
effective diuresis may be obtained if it is given at
six-hourly intervals (Murphy, Casey, and Lasagna,
1961). After control of the ascites, chlorothiazide
is given on alternate days three times a week with
potassium supplements every day.
Mercurial diuretics, such as mersalyl, are not so
potent as the thiazides but cause less potassium
excretion and have no carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
activity. In patients with signs of hepatic precoma
who require diuretic therapy it is safer to start
treatment with mersalyl, 2 ml. intramuscularly two
or three times a week, rather than risk worsening
the mental state with chlorothiazide.
Two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis and ascites
respond to chlorothiazide alone (Shaldon, 1961).
Additional diuretic therapy is needed in the remain￾ing third.
The introduction of efficient, non-toxic, aldo￾sterone antagonists has been a major advance in
the diuretic therapy of ascites with cirrhosis of the
liver. Spironolactone has been in use for three years
and has been clearly shown to produce a sodium
diuresis when used in combination with the thiazide
or mercurial diuretics (Clowdus, Higgins, Rosevear,
and Summerskill, 1960; Edmonds, 1960; Morrison
and Chalmers, 1960; Shaldon et al., 1960; Lock￾wood, 1961; Ogden, Scherr, Spritz, and Rubin, 1961;
Stewart and Constable, 1961). The rationale for the
use of this combination depends on blocking two
mechanisms for sodium reabsorption both of which
are hyperactive in patients with resistant ascites
(Fig. 4). Chlorothiazide and mercurial diuretics act
at a proximal site in the renal tubule to inhibit
sodium reabsorption. However, in the presence of
excessive aldosterone secretion, sodium blocked
from reabsorption at the proximal tubule is re￾absorbed in exchange for potassium at a distal
tubular site resulting in excessive potassium loss in
the urine (Edmonds and Wilson, 1960) and hence
no sodium diuresis ensues. Likewise, aldosterone
antagonists are rarely effective when given alone as
most of the sodium is reabsorbed proximal to their
site of action (Shaldon et al., 1960). The combination
of proximal and distal tubular diuretics, however,
results in a synergistic action and a significant sodium
diuresis. Potassium loss is reduced, although supple￾ments of about 50 to 100 mEq. of potassium daily
are required (Ross, 1961; Shaldon, 1961).
The problem of dosage and absorption of spirono￾lactone has recently been investigated (Shaldon,

Ryder, and Garsenstein, 1963). Comparative studies
were made on six patients with cirrhosis and con￾trolled ascites, all of whom without diuretics ex￾creted less than I mEq. sodium in the urine. Spirono￾lactone requirements were first established, two
patients requiring 400 mg., two 800 mg., and four
1,200 mg. daily in addition to chlorothiazide, 2 g.
daily. When a specially prepared microcrystalline
tablet of spironolactone was substituted for the
regular spironolactone an equal diuretic response
was obtained with only a quarter of the dose. Further￾more, blood levels and urinary excretion of spirono￾lactone were not significantly different with the two
preparations. The older commercial tablet seems to
have been poorly absorbed and the large doses
required in some patients may have been due to this
difficulty. However, patients who previously required
high doses of spironolactone still need one quarter of
the dose of the new microcrystalline spironolactone
(Aldactone A). The introduction of the new micro￾crystalline preparation has reduced the cost of
spironolactone by two-thirds. Initial treatment with
spironolactone (Aldactone A) should consist of
100 mg. daily. However, one-third of patients with
cirrhosis and ascites requiring this drug will not
respond at this dose level and as much as 300 mg.
daily may be necessary. We have never seen a
diuresis induced with a dose higher than 300 mg. of
Aldactone A (1,200 mg. of the old preparation). The
initial response to spironolactone is slow and there
is a delay of 24 to 48 hours before the drug acts.

that daily therapy is required even after full control
of fluid retention.
Sixteen patients requiring combined diuretic
therapy with spironolactone and chlorothiazide left
hospital with the ascites controlled and all were
followed up for three years. Eight patients died of
hepatic failure in the first year. The other eight
patients are all well, having regained their body
weight before ascites developed, and are back at
useful work (Fig. 5). Three of these patients have
required 800 to 1,200 mg. daily of old spironolactone
(200 to 300 mg. of Aldactone A) for three years to
maintain themselves free of ascites although they
have received chlorothiazide, 2 g. daily with potas￾sium supplements, and also remained on a low￾sodium diet. Two patients have been able, after one
year, to relax their dietary salt restriction. Three
patients, after two years' diuretic therapy, do not
require drugs or dietary salt restriction. Similar
results have recently been reported by Summerskill
et al. (1961) in a follow-up of 13 patients with
'resistant' ascites.
Occasionally, the diuretic response to even large
doses of spironolactone with chlorothiazide is in￾adequate and further therapy is required. Meto￾pirone, an 1 I hydroxylase inhibitor of the synthesis
of aldosterone, has been used to treat ascites (Holub
and Jailer, 1960). It has also been used to potentiate
the sodium diuresis of spironolactone and chloro￾thiazide in two patients with cirrhosis and resistant
ascites (Shaldon and McLaren, 1960). Subsequently,
three other patients have been treated and in every
instance a diuresis was initiated after other measures
had failed. In addition, one patient who had failed
to react to spironolactone, 1,200 mg. (old prepara￾tion), with chlorothiazide, 2 g. daily, and predni￾solone, 20 mg. daily, mersalyl, 2 ml. intramuscularly
on alternate days, and Mannitol, 2 litres 10% on
alternate days, had a diuresis when metopirone,
2,700 mg. daily, was added to this armamentarium.
This patient required spironolactone, metopirone,
and chlorothiazide for 18 months, any attempt to
withdraw either aldosterone antagonist resulting in
reaccumulation of ascitic fluid.
More recently, a new diuretic, a pteridine deriva￾tive (Triamterene, SKF.8542) has become available
for study (Laragh, Reilly, Stites, and Angers, 1961;
Herken and Senft, 1961; Donnelly, Turner, and
Sowry, 1962). This drug produces a sodium diuresis
with potassium retention in the normal subject on a
normal diet who is not excreting excess aldosterone
and in adrenalectomized patients not on a salt￾retaining steroid (Liddle, 1961). It is not therefore a
true aldosterone antagonist. Nevertheless, it is
capable of increasing urinary sodium output in
cirrhotic patients with ascites and will also further
potentiate the combination of chlorothiazide and
spironolactone (Shaldon and Ryder, 1962). The
main complication to its use is a very occasional
tendency to azotaemia if therapy is too intensive and
the glomelular filtration rate falls dramatically. This
complication is, however, completely reversible when
therapy is given intermittently. We have now treated
three patients with this drug for over 12 months as
out-patients.

Sheila Sherlock and Stanley Shaldon
Relative water over sodium retention oftendevelops
during intensive diuretic therapy in cirrhotic patients
with ascites, especially when free water clearance is
reduced by chlorothiazide and spironolactone
therapy. The resultant hyponatraemia may be
asymptomatic, may result in listlessness, or may lead
to hepatic precoma. In these circumstances water
diuretics are required. Mannitol acts as an osmotic
diuretic and so increases the 'free water clearance' in
such patients; the serum sodium level then rises
(Shaldon, 1960). Two litres 10% Mannitol are given
intravenously and may need to be repeated as often
as on alternate days to achieve an effect. Rigors
associated with pyrogen reactions are a complication
of this therapy but may be effectively controlled with
antipyretics such as aspirin. Prednisone gives the
same result by increasing the glomerular filtration
rate and reducing tubular reabsorption of water
(Chalmers and Morrison, 1961). Unfortunately,
fulminant infections often complicate the long￾continued use of steroids in these patients (Stormont,
Crabbe, Fast, Wolfe, and Davidson, 1959). Both
Mannitol and prednisone will potentiate a sodium
diuresis induced by chlorothiazide and spirono￾lactone. Prednisone has also been used as a sodium
diuretic in its own right (Cattan and Vesin, 1957).
Other agents used to potentiate a diuresis include
calcium gluconate (Dingman and Yoffee, 1960) and
acidifying amino-acids (arginine and lysine) (Gidekel,
Sherlock, Peterson, and Vanamee, 1960; Lasser,
Schoenfeld, and Friedberg, 1960), which probably
act as osmotic diuretics, although this is not certain.
The main danger of combined diuretic therapy is
the development of electrolyte imbalance due to
disproportionate loss of sodium and potassium with
relative water retention. If the patient becomes pre￾comatose therapy must be stopped. However, in the
absence of symptoms. hyponatraemia does not
require treatment and in particular sodium therapy
must never be given. Azotaemia and progressive
renal failure are occasionally precipitated by over￾intensive diuretic therapy and under these circum￾stances a reduction in renal blood flow is probably
the operative factor. This complication is rarely
seen in the absence of terminal liver failure and occurs
as frequently in patients who are not on diuretics
as in those to whom diuretic therapy is given (Hecker
and Sherlock, 1956; Vesin, 1962). The high incidence
of renal failure associated with diuretic therapy
which had previously been reported (Cattan, Caroli,
Debray, Pequignot, and Vesin, 1962) probably
reflects results in a severely ill group of cirrhotic
patients who were alcoholics. Nevertheless, in such
patients stopping all diuretics and performing a
small paracentesis may be the best management.
Reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure may
relieve tension on the renal veins and so increase
renal blood flow (Bradley and Bradley, 1947). The
use of haemodialysis to treat the renal failure and
ascites in such patients has been disappointing
(Shaldon and Walker, 1962), for in them the problem
is not only fluid retention but failure of all the
liver's functions. Control of one facet cannot be
expected to reverse other abnormalities such as
haemorrhage or deepening jaundice.
Although sufficient diuretic agents acting at
different tubular sites are available, the ideal diuretic
has not yet arrived. Resistant ascites is no longer a
problem, but electrolyte disturbances do result from
combined diuretic therapy and the prevention of
these and their management remain difficult.
OTHER MEASURES Haemodialysis has been used to
remove ascitic fluid by a process of ultrafiltration,
so removing plasma water (Goldsmith, Nakamoto,
and Kolff, 1960). We have dialysed one patient with
cirrhosis and ascites with severe hyponatraemia.
After a haemodialysis lasting six hours with re￾moval of water by ultrafiltration the serum sodium
level rose from 98 to 120 mEq. per litre with removal
of 6 litres of ascitic fluid. There was a commensurate
improvement in the patient's condition.
The management of ascites with intensive, com￾bined diuretic and dietary therapy has for practical
purposes eliminated other methods which have been
proposed. These include salt-free human albumin
infusions which are said to be effective in promoting
a diuresis in diuretic-resistant patients (Dykes, 1961;
Losowsky and Atkinson, 1961). Resistance, how￾ever, was based on the failure of only one diuretic
without the addition of spironolactone. In a subse￾quent controlled trial, salt-free human albumin in￾fusions, given over many months, have been shown
to have no effect on life expectancy, well-being,
working capacity, control of fluid retention, or drug
requirements of patients with resistant ascites, pro￾vided that aldosterone antagonists, chlorothiazide,
and a strict low-sodium diet were also contained in
the therapeutic regime (Wilkinson and Sherlock,
1962). An alternative to salt-free human albumin
has been the removal of sodium from ascitic fluid
after paracentesis by dialysis with an artificial kidney.
The salt-free ascitic fluid is then given back to the
patient intravenously (Britton, 1961).
Abdominal paracentesis historically antedates
most other therapeutic measures in the treatment of
ascites. The hazards of paracentesis in the cirrhotic
patient include electrolyte disturbances, uraemia,
infection, haemorrhage, protein depletion, and hep￾atic coma (Nelson, Rosenbaum, and Strauss, 1951;
Liebowitz, 1962; Sherlock, 1963). In spite of these
dangers many patients still receive unnecessary and

The aetiology and management of ascites in patients with hepatic cirrhosis: A review 103
potentially dangerous peritoneal taps. Paracentesis
is justified only to relieve tense ascites at the outset
of diuretic therapy and for diagnostic purposes to
exclude a complicating hepatoma or peritoneal
infection. Tuberculous peritoneal disease is not an
uncommon, unsuspected complication of alcoholic
cirrhosis (Burack and Hollister, 1960).
Peritoneal caval shunt is an alternative surgical
measure designed to drain ascitic fluid internally
(Smith, 1962). A catheter with a one-way Spitz￾Holter valve drains fluid from the peritoneal cavity
into the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein.
Previously intractable ascites was controlled in one
patient, although diuretic therapy was still necessary
(Smith, Preshaw, and Bisset, 1962). Other drainage
methods include absorption of ascitic fluid by an
everted loop of intestine (ileoentectropy) (Christeas,
Kottakis, and Georgiades, 1961) and drainage of
ascitic fluid into the pleural cavity (El-Toraei, 1961).
Dumont and Mulholland (1960) observed an in￾creased flow of thoracic duct lymph in cirrhotic
patients with ascites. Drainage of the lymph by
cannulating the thoracic duct resulted in rapid
removal of ascites.
Portacaval anastomosis is the most valuable
surgical treatment of ascites. Effective decompression
of the portal bed, with lowering of the portal pres￾sure, often results in permanent relief of ascites and
restoration of normal salt tolerance. The choice of
portacaval anastomoses lies between end-to-side
(Blakemore, 1952; Eisenmenger and Nickel, 1956;
Ekman, 1957; Crane, 1962; Gliedman, Sellers,
Burkle, and Enquist, 1962), side-to-side (Welch et al.,
1959; Barker and Reemtsma, 1960), or double side￾to-side (McDermott, 1960), both ends of the portal
vein being implanted separately into the inferior
vena cava. The theoretical haemodynamic advantages
associated with side-to-side portacaval anastomosis,
including relief of the hepatic outflow block, have
not been substantiated in practice (Crane, 1962).
Although portacaval anastomosis will cure ascites
in cirrhotic patients retaining fluid but otherwise in
good general condition, this operation carries a 50 %
mortality (Blakemore, 1952). There is a high inci￾dence of portal systemic encephalopathy (episodic
hepatic stupor) afterwards (Read, Laidlaw, and
Sherlock, 1961). Furthermore, ascites is rarely due
to portal hypertension alone and implies defective
hepatocellular function. Hypoalbuminaemia persists
post-operatively and ankle oedema often develops.
The operation should be reserved for those whose
financial position or remoteness from medical super￾vision puts them in a position where they cannot
receive a low-sodium diet and adequate long-term
diuretic therapy.
