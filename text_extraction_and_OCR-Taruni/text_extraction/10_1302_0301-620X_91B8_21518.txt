Abstract
The use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of avascular necrosis of
the femoral head is an encouraging but relatively new option with
most published data being derived from small trials with limited
follow-up. We present a clinicoradiological analysis of 395 hips
with avascular necrosis which were treated with oral alendronate
for three years with a mean follow-up of four years (1 to 8).
Our results show an improvement in the clinical function, a
reduction in the rate of collapse and a decrease in the requirement
for total hip replacement, compared with the findings of other
studies in which no treatment was given. This improvement is
particularly marked if the treatment is begun in the pre-collapse
stages of the disease. Even in Ficat stage-III hips some benefit was
obtained from treatment with alendronate by at least a delay in the
need for total hip replacement.
