ABSTRACT
Background: Previous studies of non-smoking individuals
with severe a1-antitrypsin deficiency (PiZZ) have been
sparse and included only a limited number of individuals,
mostly identified by respiratory symptoms. The aim of this
study was to estimate the prognosis of non-smoking PiZZ
individuals and to analyse the most common causes of
death by including a large number of individuals who had
been identified by other means than respiratory symp￾toms.
Methods: The study included 568 non-smoking PiZZ
subjects who were selected from the Swedish National
AAT Deficiency Registry and followed up from 1991 to
September 2007. Of these, 156 (27%) were identified by
respiratory symptoms (respiratory cases) and 412 were
identified by extrapulmonary symptoms or screening (non￾respiratory cases).
Results: 93 subjects (16%) died during the follow-up
period. The specific standardised mortality rate (SMR) for
the whole study population was 2.32 (95% CI 1.87 to
2.83) with no significant difference between men and
women. The SMR was 2.55 (95% CI 1.91 to 2.83) for the
respiratory cases and 2.07 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.81) for the
non-respiratory cases. Further calculation of SMR for
subgroups in the non-respiratory cases showed that the
SMR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.14 to 2.04) for individuals
identified by family/population screening. Emphysema and
liver cirrhosis were the most common causes of death
(45% and 28%, respectively). Malignant transformation
was found in 38% of the cases with cirrhosis.
Conclusion: Non-smoking PiZZ individuals identified by
screening do not have an increased mortality risk
compared with the Swedish general population.
Severe a1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (PiZZ) is a
relatively rare genetic disorder characterised by
reduced serum levels of AAT. This genetic defect
results in polymerisation of the AAT molecule in
the hepatocytes, leading to accumulation of the Z￾protein within the hepatocytes and decreased
release into the circulation. In individuals with
normal AAT genes, circulating AAT is distributed
to the lungs to serve a protective function against
the destruction of elastin, a protein that supports
the lung structure.1–3
Panacinar emphysema is the most prevalent
clinical disorder associated with severe AAT defi￾ciency and the most frequent cause of disability and
death.4–6 Tobacco smoking is the major identifiable
environmental risk factor for developing emphy￾sema, which begins much earlier than usual emphy￾sema that occurs in AAT-replete individuals. Liver
disease is the second most frequent clinical manifes￾tation of severe AAT deficiency and typically
presents as cholestasis in infancy.7 8 In general,
cirrhosis and carcinoma of the liver affect AAT￾deficient adults over the age of 50 years.9–11
The natural history of never-smoking PiZZ
individuals has been poorly documented. Previous
studies have shown that PiZZ never-smokers have
a remarkably delayed onset of symptoms and may
have an almost normal life span.12–14 These studies
have been sparse and included only a limited
number of never-smokers.
The aim of this study was to estimate the
prognosis of non-smoking PiZZ individuals and to
analyse the most common causes of death by
including a large number of individuals who had
been identified for reasons other than respiratory
symptoms.
METHODS
Study population
The Swedish National Registry of individuals with
severe AAT deficiency was initiated in 1991.12 The
main objective of the registry is to collect
information on the natural history of AAT
deficiency and to facilitate epidemiological studies.
Eligibility criteria for enrolment in the registry are
age >18 years, severe AAT deficiency (PiZZ, PiZ
Null and PiNull Null) and written informed
consent. Clinical examination, blood samples (liver
function) and lung function tests are performed at
the patient’s local hospital. Thereafter, the results
are reported to the registry via a questionnaire
which is answered by the attending physician
every 2 years. Since 1999, all newly diagnosed
subjects are also included in the Alpha One
International Registry (AIR).15
The Pi phenotypes are verified by isoelectric
focusing at the Department of Clinical Chemistry,
University Hospital Malmo¨.16 All individuals were
identified as phenotype PiZZ (few possible cases of
PiZ Null, but none of PiNull Null). Phenotypes
were available for all cases.
The indications for plasma protein analysis leading
to PiZZ diagnosis were obtained from the ques￾tionnaire. The patients identified because of respira￾tory diseases or symptoms, including repeated
respiratory tract infections, are referred to as
‘‘respiratory cases’’ (R cases). The patients identified
because of liver diseases, other diseases and family/
population screening are referred to as ‘‘non-respira￾tory cases’’ (NR cases). The subgroup ‘‘other
diseases’’ includes renal diseases, joint symptoms,
repeated infections other than respiratory tract
infection, high sedimentation rate, or other signs
and symptoms for which plasma protein analysis has
been performed as part of the clinical investigation.
All symptoms and diagnoses were reported by the
attending physician.

Standard lung function tests were performed at the local
hospitals. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced
vital capacity (FVC) are expressed as percentage of predicted
values according to European reference tables.17 The FEV1/FVC
ratio is expressed as a percentage. Results of the first spirometric
measurement at the time of enrolment in the registry were
used. Post-bronchodilator values were analysed.
Details of smoking habits were also obtained from the
questionnaire. The patients investigated in this study were
lifelong non-smokers. The patient’s employment at the time of
enrolment was obtained from the questionnaire and classified
into various occupational categories according to the Standard
Swedish Classification of Occupational Categories compiled by
Statistics Sweden.
The Swedish AAT Registry is approved by the local research
and ethics committee (Institutional Ethics Committee, Lund
University, Sweden) and by the Swedish Data Inspection Board.
Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior
to inclusion in the register.
Causes of death
The date of death was obtained from the Swedish Registry of
Deaths. Vital status was available for all patients at the closing
point of the study (1 September 2007). Information about liver
transplantation and lung transplantation was obtained from
the questionnaire and medical records. For each death, the
medical records from the hospital at which the death occurred
were reviewed. These records included medical charts from the
terminal hospitalisation, last outpatient visits (if the patient
died at home) and the death certificate. An autopsy protocol for
patients who had undergone complete post-mortem examina￾tion was obtained from the Department of Pathology at which
the autopsy was performed. All available records and autopsy
protocols were analysed to determine the underlying and
immediate causes of death. The underlying cause of death was
defined as ‘‘the single disease or injury that influenced the
events causing death’’. The immediate cause of death was
defined as ‘‘the single final disease, injury or complication
directly causing death’’.
Statistical analysis
The period of follow-up for the survival calculation was taken
from the date of enrolment in the registry to the date of death,
date of transplantation or to 1 September 2007 (closing date of
study). The x2 test was used to compare categorical variables
and the Student t test was used for group comparisons. Post￾bronchodilator spirometry data are presented as medians with
upper and lower quartile values (P25–P75). To compare the death
rates in the never-smoking PiZZ individuals with the general
Swedish population, the specific standardised mortality rate
(SMR) was calculated as the ratio of observed to expected
deaths. The expected numbers of deaths were obtained using
age-, sex- and date-specific death rates published in Sweden
annually (Statistics Sweden).18 Confidence intervals for SMR
were computed from the Poisson distribution. A p value of
,0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Study population
Up to September 2007 a total of 1297 PiZZ individuals were
included in the registry. Of these, 568 (44%) were never￾smokers and were included in the statistical analysis. One
hundred and fifty-six subjects (27%) were R cases and 412 were
NR cases. Among the 412 NR cases, 56 individuals (14%) had
been identified because of liver disease, 169 (41%) because of
other disease and 187 (45%) by family/population screening.
The demographic baseline data are shown in table 1; 47% of
the study population were men, with 49% among the R cases
and 47% among the NR cases. The R cases were older at the
time of diagnosis and enrolment in the registry than the NR
cases. The NR cases were followed up longer than the R cases.
Lung function
Post-bronchodilator spirometry data were available for 90% of
the R cases and 93% of the NR cases. The results of the lung
function tests stratified by age at inclusion in the registry are
shown in table 2. The median FEV1 (% predicted) was
significantly higher in the NR cases than in the R cases
(p,0.001). On average, study subjects aged ,50 years had
normal lung function in both groups while, in individuals aged
>50 years, lung function was significantly lower than in the
younger age group (p,0.001, table 2).
There was no significant difference in the spirometric values
between men and women, the median (P25–P75) FEV1 (%
predicted) was 94 (77–105) and 93 (78–105), respectively. When
the lung function tests for men and women were stratified by
age at inclusion, there was no significant difference between
men and women aged ,50 years (median FEV1 98 (90–107)%
predicted and 100 (91–108)% predicted, respectively; p = 0.2). In
contrast, women aged >50 years had significantly higher FEV1
values than men in the same age subgroup, with a median FEV1
of 81 (59–97)% predicted and 67 (47–93)% predicted, respec￾tively (p,0.01).
Respiratory diseases and symptoms at inclusion
Of the 156 R cases, 74 (47%) were reported to have pulmonary
emphysema at inclusion, 33 (21%) had chronic bronchitis, 26
(17%) asthma, 4 (3%) pulmonary fibrosis, 6 (4%) bronchiectasis
and 13 (8%) were reported to have other respiratory symptoms
such as cough, phlegm or one or more attacks of pneumonia.
Thirty-seven individuals in the R group were aged ,50 years at
inclusion. Their lung diseases and symptoms were pulmonary
emphysema (n = 5), chronic bronchitis (n = 7), asthma (n = 17),
bronchiectasis (n = 1) and other respiratory symptoms (n = 7).
In 94 of the 412 NR cases (23%) a diagnosis of respiratory
diseases or respiratory symptoms was reported at the time of
inclusion. Of these 94 NR cases, 23 (24%) were reported to have
pulmonary emphysema, 13 (14%) chronic bronchitis, 42 (45%)
asthma, 2 (2%) pulmonary fibrosis, 6 (6%) bronchiectasis and in
8 (9%) other respiratory symptoms were reported. Their median

age (range) at onset of the respiratory symptoms was 45 (12–
76) years vs 52 (4–82) years in the R cases (p,0.01).
Occupation
The patient’s occupation was known in 87% (n = 493) of the
subjects (77% in the R cases and 90% in the NR cases); 38%
(n = 45) of the R cases and 18% (n = 68) of the NR cases had an
occupation with a risk for exposure to airway irritants including
agriculture, forestry, mining, trades and crafts, operation and
assembly of machines and transport (p = 0.001). In the group
with risk for exposure there were more men than women (80%
and 20%, respectively).
Survival
During the follow-up period 93 individuals (16%) died, 52 (33%)
of the 156 R cases and 41 (10%) of the 412 NR cases. Among the
NR cases, 12 (21%) of the 56 individuals identified by liver
disease, 26 (15%) of the 169 individuals identified by other
diseases and 3 (2%) of the 187 individuals identified by screening
died during the follow-up. The median age at death was
76 years for the R cases and 75 years for the NR cases, with no
significant difference. The SMR for the whole study population
was 2.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87 to 2.83). There was
no significant difference in SMR between men and women,
with values of 2.31 (95% CI 1.66 to 3.12) and 2.32 (95% CI 1.74
to 3.04), respectively. The SMR was 2.55 (95% CI 1.91 to 2.83)
for the R cases and 2.07 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.81) for the NR cases.
Further calculation of SMR for subgroups in the NR cases
showed that SMR was 5.00 (95% CI 2.58 to 8.73) for individuals
identified by liver diseases, 1.98 (95% CI 1.30 to 2.91) for
individuals identified by other diseases and 0.70 (95% CI 0.14 to
2.04) for individuals identified by family/population screening.
Causes of death
Medical records were available for all 93 decedents. Autopsies
were performed in 18 cases (19%) and autopsy protocols were
available for all of these cases. The most common underlying
causes of death were emphysema in 45% and liver disease in
28% (table 3). Malignancy accounted for 14% of the deaths. The
underlying malignant diseases were pulmonary carcinoma
(n = 3), urinary-genital carcinoma (n = 3), gastrointestinal
malignancy (n = 4), melanoma (n = 1), lymphoma (n = 1) and
pancreatic carcinoma (n = 1). Cardio/cerebrovascular diseases
and renal diseases accounted for the remainder.
The immediate causes of death in the R and NR cases are
shown in table 4. Respiratory failure with or without
pulmonary infection was the most common immediate cause
of death (40% of cases). Hepatic complications due mostly to
liver cirrhosis accounted for 24% of the immediate causes of
death. The majority of the NR cases (53%) died of causes other

Liver disease among the deceased
Twenty-nine patients who died (31%) had liver disease. Of
these, 12 cases had liver cirrhosis at enrolment in the register, 8
cases developed liver disease during the follow-up period (6
primary liver carcinoma diagnosed by biopsy and 2 liver
cirrhosis diagnosed clinically), and the remaining 9 cases were
diagnosed as having liver disease at autopsy (5 primary liver
carcinoma and 4 liver cirrhosis). The median time between
diagnosis and death for patients with primary liver carcinoma
ranged from a few weeks to a few months.
The median age at death was 70 years (range 24–84) for the
patients with liver disease. Liver diseases were the underlying
cause of death in 26 of these 29 cases. In the remainding 3 cases
the underlying causes of death were pulmonary carcinoma
(n = 1) and accident (n = 2).
DISCUSSION
This study included a large number of PiZZ individuals who had
never smoked and most of them had been identified by reasons
other than respiratory symptoms. These individuals were
followed-up prospectively from 1991 to 2007 using the
Swedish AAT Registry.12 We found that never-smoking PiZZ
individuals identified by respiratory symptoms, liver diseases
and other diseases had a higher mortality risk than those
identified by family/population screening. Thus, the screening
group did not have an increased mortality risk compared with
the normal Swedish population. This finding is in accordance
with the findings in previous studies by Seersholm et al13 14
showing that the non-index cases did not have an excess
mortality compared with the normal Danish population in spite
of the fact that these studies included only a limited number of
non-index cases.
Previously published studies of never-smoking PiZZ indivi￾duals are sparse and included mostly patients with respiratory
symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Black et al reported a
relatively good prognosis for PiZZ never-smokers who avoided
known respiratory irritants.19 This study included only 22
individuals. The study by Seersholm et al14 showing that most
PiZZ never-smokers had a normal life without respiratory
symptoms included only 75 never-smokers.
In agreement with previously published studies, we found
that emphysema is the underlying cause of death in most never￾smokers (45%). Seersholm et al reported that emphysema was
the cause of death in 14 of 21 never-smokers who died.14 Stoller
et al20 found that emphysema was the main underlying cause of
death in 9 of 16 never-smokers.
An important finding in our study was the predominant role
of cirrhosis-related mortality in elderly never-smokers. Cirrhosis
and its complications were the main cause of death in 26 of 93
never-smokers and occurred in 29 of 93 patients. Malignant
transformation was found in 38% of cases with cirrhosis. These
findings agree with the most recent data which suggest that
cirrhosis and carcinoma of the liver affect 30–40% of PiZZ
individuals over the age of 50 years and are a significant cause of
death in never-smokers.9–11 Eriksson reported that cirrhosis was
the main cause of death in 12 of 41 PiZZ individuals who died in
Malmo¨, Sweden; cirrhosis found at the post-mortem examina￾tion was more common among elderly never-smokers (71%).
Malignant transformation was seen in 5 of 14 cases of
cirrhosis.11 Our findings agree closely with those of Eriksson,
suggesting that the risk of cirrhosis is increased in elderly PiZZ
never-smokers and that cirrhosis should be considered as a pre￾malignant condition.
Previous studies have consistently shown that lung function
is well preserved in early adult life in non-smoking PiZZ
individuals.12 21 22 In our study, most never-smokers seemed to
have normal lung function until 50 years of age. The deteriora￾tion in lung function seems to begin after this age in the R cases,
while NR cases maintain their normal lung function after the
age of 50 years. Our previous study showed similar results, but
the number of NR cases over the age of 50 was small and none
of them was older than 61 years.12 In the present study, 30% of
the NR cases were aged .50 years and 17% were .60 years of
age.
Twenty-three percent of the NR cases had respiratory disease
at the time of enrolment. Most of these patients were identified
by neonatal/population screening. Among them, there was a
high prevalence of asthma (45%) which had been diagnosed by
the attending physician during childhood or early adulthood.
These findings explain the earlier onset of respiratory symptoms
(45 years of age) in this subgroup of NR cases compared with
the R cases (52 years of age).
It is still unclear why some PiZZ individuals develop severe
lung disease and others remain asymptomatic in the absence of
the important risk factor for the development of emphysema
(ie, active smoking). We found that the group of R cases
included significantly more individuals with high-risk occupa￾tions than the group of NR cases. There was also a male
predominance among the group with high-risk occupations.
This finding may explain the impairment of lung function in R
cases and in men aged .50 years. However, only current
employment status was reported and no details of duration of
exposure to airway irritants were available.
The first limitation of our study is the fact that it is a
register-based study and the subjects included in the Swedish
AAT Registry do not represent a random sample of adult PiZZ
individuals living in Sweden. However, the proportion of the
individuals identified for reasons other than respiratory
symptoms is higher than in other registries. The second
limitation is that smoking habits were self-reported and no
objective tests such as the cotinine level in plasma or urine
were analysed. The third limitation is that we compared the
SMR for the study population with SMR for the general
Swedish population because no data are available on mortality
in the subgroups based on smoking habits in the Swedish
general population.
We conclude that never-smoking PiZZ individuals seem to
have a higher mortality risk than the Swedish general
population except for individuals identified by family/
population screening who seem to have the same mortality
rate as the general population. The risk of liver cirrhosis and
liver carcinoma is high in elderly never-smoking PiZZ
individuals.

A new theory for the pathogenesis of chronic lung
disease?
Chronic inflammatory disease is generally thought to be the result of an altered adaptive immune
response. This paper describes a novel innate immune pathway driven by persistent viral
infection.
A mouse model of chronic inflammatory lung disease was generated by a viral infection which
produced mucous cell metaplasia and airway hyper-responsiveness. Maximal airway disease
activity coincided with a peak of CD1d-dependent T cell receptor-invariant natural killer T
(NKT) cell recruitment of macrophages as well as peak interleukin (IL)13 levels in the lungs. This
cellular interaction was independent of CD4+ T cells which were previously thought to be the
focus of a response to allergens in the lungs.
It has long been suggested that common respiratory viruses are central to the development of
chronic airway inflammation in asthma, particularly in children. However, it is not clear how
this could occur many years after the apparent clearance of the infection. Interestingly, this
report shows that the virus initiating the airway damage remains detectable in the lung in trace
amounts, and further studies will be needed to establish the relevance of persistent infection in
those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The discovery of this new immune axis suggests that the recruitment and persistent activation
of IL13 producing macrophages by NKT cells in human lung tissue may be involved in the
development of chronic lung disease.
