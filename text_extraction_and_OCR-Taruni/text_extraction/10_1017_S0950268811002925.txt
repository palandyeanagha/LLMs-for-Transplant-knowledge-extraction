SUMMARY
Space–time clustering of people who fall acutely ill with jaundice, then slip into coma and death,
is an alarming phenomenon, more markedly so when the victims are mostly or exclusively
pregnant. Documentation of the peculiar, fatal predisposition of pregnant women during
outbreaks of jaundice identifies hepatitis E and enables construction of its epidemic history.
Between the last decade of the 18th century and the early decades of the 20th century, hepatitis
E-like outbreaks were reported mainly from Western Europe and several of its colonies. During
the latter half of the 20th century, reports of these epidemics, including those that became
serologically confirmed as hepatitis E, emanated from, first, the eastern and southern
Mediterranean littoral and, thereafter, Southern and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the rest of
Africa. The dispersal has been accompanied by a trend towards more frequent and larger-scale
occurrences. Epidemic and endemic hepatitis E still beset people inhabiting Asia and Africa,
especially pregnant women and their fetuses and infants. Their relief necessitates not only
accelerated access to potable water and sanitation but also vaccination against hepatitis E.
Key words: Hepatitis E, immunization (vaccination), public health microbiology, virus infection,

Introduction
The year 1858 was marked in Martinique by the appearance
of an epidemic of jaundice.
O. Saint-Vel, 1862 [1]
So begins Saint-Vel’s account of a strange disease
that visited the French Caribbean colony. Striking
first at St Pierre in April [2], it then spread across
the island, and by the end of the year, left 24 people
dead, all women [1]. At the garrison in nearby Fort￾de-France, none of the jaundiced soldiers perished
[3]. Reflecting on the epidemic’s alarming propensity
to kill women, Saint-Vel’s contemporary in Paris,
Hervieux, averred: ‘ there was a severe form, always
the same, always fatal: the comatose form’ [4]. The
risk factor for fatality was not just being female, but
being pregnant: for that was the condition of 20 of the
dead.
The epidemic in Martinique was among the earliest
of its kind recorded. Might it have been hepatitis E – a
transmissible, jaundice-engendering disease that can
not only take on epidemic proportions but also
generate excess cases of hepatic coma and death in
gestational women ? This review examines outbreaks
of jaundice that have especially imperilled the preg￾nant, assessing if those occurrences may be, or are – in
fact – hepatitis E.

Literature search
Monographs published in the 19th century which de￾scribe diseases that cause epidemics of acute jaundice
were consulted for discussion of outbreaks notable
for deaths in pregnant women. Reports cited in
the key monographs [3, 5–7] were accessed. The
terms ‘jaundice’, ‘yellow atrophy’, ‘liver necrosis’,
‘outbreak’, ‘epidemic’, ‘pregnant’ and ‘women’,
in various combinations, were searched among
titles, abstracts, or both, in: Tropical Diseases
Bulletin; Bulletin of Hygiene; Journal of the American
Medical Association including its Current Medical
Literature section of volumes 32–144 (1899–1950);
The Lancet; British Medical Journal; Transactions
of the Royal Society of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine; and the Quarterly Journal of Medicine.
These terms were also searched using PubMed.
Primary articles thought pertinent were then sourced
for review.
Early epidemics
Since the 18th century when epidemics of jaundice
started being documented [5], two earlier outbreaks
were noted for leading pregnant women into coma,
then death. One cluster occurred in Ludenscheid in
the Palatinate (1794) [8] and the other in Roubaix,
France (1852–1854) [9]. Neither was as devastating as
what Saint-Vel witnessed. Two subsequent epidemics
in France, which struck Limoges (1859) [10] and Paris
(1871) [3, 11], wherein fatalities were observed only
among gestating (and to a lesser extent, parturient
and postpartum) women, alerted continental phys￾icians to the possibility that certain jaundice epi￾demics could in the course of hitting the population
at large put pregnant women at especial risk of death
[7]. A comment by Ollivier (1873) typifies such
wonderment:
It is remarkable that in epidemics of jaundice that sponta￾neously develop in a city or a small region, we see quite
often a disease become serious in pregnant women, whereas
it was benign in other women [13].
Deaths were not confined to the mothers. In
Martinique, almost all of the dead women delivered
stillborn infants [1]. Other outbreaks generated high
rates of premature delivery, miscarriages and still￾births not only among the dead but the survivors also.
Thus, in Limoges, there were six stillbirths compared
to three maternal deaths [10]; and in Paris, although
of the 16 cases only two died, ten aborted spon￾taneously or delivered prematurely [7].
In the Paris outbreak of 1871 [12], pregnant case￾patients were admitted to La Maternite´, the lying-in
hospital for the city’s poor [3, 7, 11]. Autopsies
conducted there to identify the causes of maternal and
infant mortality [14] attributed the demise of the
jaundiced women to acute yellow atrophy. This term
had been introduced some three decades before to
describe the striking yellow and shrunken appearance
at post-mortem of the melting liver, during which it
is ‘drowned in the bilious deliquescence, and dis￾appears’ [6]. Such a vivid morbid entity, correlating
microscopically with massive necrosis of the hepatic
parenchyma, became associated with a puzzling dis￾order occasionally encountered in acutely jaundiced
patients whereupon coma would supervene, advanc￾ing to death, the extent of overt haemorrhage being
variable. An over-representation of pregnant women
(up to a third) had begun to be noted in case-series
studies of patients who died from the condition [3, 6,
7] but not until the La Maternite´ outbreak was it
linked directly to fatalities arising from an epidemic.
As the 19th century progressed, four more space–
time clusters of jaundice epidemics bearing similar
predilections for pregnant women were reported,
albeit small in scale compared to the Martinique
outbreak. One occurred in Heusenstamm, Germany
(1874) [15] and the others in more dispersed localities:
St Paul, Minnesota (1874) [16] and an unspecified
village in Tennessee (1898) [17], the USA; and also
Brisbane, in Queensland (1888) [18]. Only in the
Brisbane outbreak were autopsies performed, the
livers of four of the five women being found shrunken
and rhubarb-yellow. Over the same period in
Australia, two other clusters, located in Sydney, were
observed in which pregnant women were the most
severely affected although none perished [19, 20].
At the turn of the century, central Italy became the
focus of similar epidemics, with clusters appearing
successively in Parma (1904–1905) [21], Portoferraio
on the island of Elba (1906) [22], Piombino (1908)
[23], Porto San Giorgio (1909) [24] and Soriano nel
Cimino (1910) [25]. Simultaneous to the Portoferraio
outbreak was an island-wide epidemic which afflicted
an estimated 700 inhabitants with jaundice [22]. In
1916, another outbreak broke out in the mainland,
this time in Galeata [26]. At all sites, fatalities were
exclusive to pregnant women. Subsequently, except
for one notification of a small cluster among natives
in Bombay [27], the flow of publications relating to
these mysterious epidemics abated, until about the
onset of the Second World War. Passing allusions had

been made to jaundice epidemics in Russia prominent
for deaths in pregnant women – there was one out￾break that hit Sverdlovsk between 1920 and 1921
[28, 29], and another in Tomsk (year of onset un￾specified) [29] – but count data were not provided.
Figure 1 summarizes the epidemics so far described
that reported case-frequency data, mortality￾frequency data, or both.
Nosological and aetiological clarifications
Acute yellow atrophy was initially thought to be a
specific disease entity [30]. Over the early decades of
the 20th century it was revealed instead as an outcome
of insults to the liver by a variety of infectious agents
as well as toxic chemicals, notably phosphorus,
chloroform, cinchophen and trinitrotoluene [31].
Close microscopic studies showed that regardless of
cause, degenerative and necrotic changes could in a
given hepatic lobule involve hepatocytes surrounding
the central vein or the zone between it and the portal
vein, or extend to include both zones, even the entire
lobule [32] and these changes were variably ac￾companied by fatty metamorphosis, inflammatory
infiltration, stromal collapse, phagocytosis, bile￾ductular and hepatocytic regeneration, vascular￾ization and haemorrhage, and fibrosis [33]. The form
of yellow atrophy that was particularly severe in
pregnant women was classified as idiopathic [30, 33].
Persuasive evidence implicating idiopathic yellow
atrophy as representing the fatal stage of viral hepa￾titis came to light during the Second World War

Global epidemic history of hepatitis E 769

[34–36] from necropsies performed in American
soldiers and their contacts who perished after the
soldiers contracted post-vaccinal hepatitis (they had
been inoculated with attenuated yellow-fever virus
which was cultured and stabilized in contaminated
human serum) [36]. Acute yellow atrophy, now re￾cognized as having ‘no specific connotation but merely
means any acute massive necrosis of the liver’ [37],
was replaced by a more functional, syndromic label
that is still current: fulminant hepatic failure (FHF).
The term ‘hepatitis’ presumes inflammatory
injury to hepatocytes and implicates the hepatic
parenchyma, not mesenchyma, as the primary site of
disease. Opposing this concept was ‘catarrhal jaun￾dice’, thought to arise from plugging of the common
bile duct by mucus produced from gastroduodenitis.
Such notion came to dominate thinking regarding
the pathogenesis of simple jaundice (that seemingly
distinct form of acute jaundice that was generally self￾resolving, not associated with cholelithiasis, and
could occur epidemically or sporadically) [38, 39]. It
expanded to accommodate oedematous swelling of
the ampulla of Vater and ascending cholangitis as
contributing to jaundice. Against this mechanistic
interpretation of pathogenesis were findings from
prototypic dye-excretion tests and biochemical
measurements in blood which pointed to hepatocytic
injury [40]. More critically, whereas autopsy audits
showed little or no extra-hepatic bile-duct obstruction
[41], microscopic studies using autopsied livers from
fatal cases of catarrhal jaundice and cases who hap￾pened to die of other causes [42] and using aspir￾ational liver biopsies conducted on living patients
diagnosed with catarrhal jaundice [43, 44] presented
unequivocal evidence of degenerative pleomorphism
among hepatocytes and disruption of the hepatic￾cord architecture. Hepatonecrosis was accompanied
by lobular, often periportal, infiltration of lympho￾cytes and other mononuclear cells. Catarrhal jaundice
was, without doubt, a hepatitis.
Nor was catarrhal jaundice benign. When it broke
out in families [42, 45] and among troops [46], fatal￾ities could be observed in some cases although most
recovered without sequelae. Such disparate outcomes
elicited suspicion that acute yellow atrophy and
catarrhal jaundice represented extreme ends of a
spectrum. Morphological studies verified that the
pathology of incipient liver atrophy was not signifi￾cantly different from that of catarrhal jaundice
[43–46], thereby unifying nosologically these two ap￾parently disparate entities.
If the hepatic parenchyma were to be the seat of
disease, the causative agent would be one that targets
hepatocytes haematogenously from the general cir￾culatory system, or more directly from the portal
system. After a spirochaete was discovered as the
cause of Weil’s disease, extensive investigations
were launched to determine if leptospires [47] could
be the agent of epidemic catarrhal jaundice: they
could not [39]. The typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli
were also implicated; any association between infec￾tion by these or other enteric bacteria and acute
jaundice was later ascribed to intestinal infections
and hepatitis co-prevailing under unsanitary condi￾tions [48].
During the Second World War the catastrophic
epidemics of post-vaccinal hepatitis entangled with
outbreaks of camp jaundice that were rife among
Allied and Axis forces [34–36, 49]. These debilitating
epidemics galvanized efforts to identify the icterogenic
agent. Two forms of hepatitis were confirmed, one
form with a short and the other with a long incubation
period. The former corresponded with what was being
observed in the field as ‘infectious hepatitis’, essen￾tially a filth disease, and the latter with ‘homologous
serum hepatitis’, coined to embrace a variety of in￾jection-transmitted diseases other than post-vaccinal
jaundice such as post-arsphenamine (salvarsan) jaun￾dice, transfusion jaundice and syringe jaundice
[39, 50]. Significantly, jaundice was transmissible in
human serial passage after the volunteers were in￾oculated with filtered material extracted from serum
or stools (for infectious hepatitis), or from pre￾dominantly serum (for serum hepatitis), further im￾plicating the icterogenic agent as a virus [30, 39, 51].
By the time catarrhal jaundice was abandoned
from medical parlance [52], it had undergone major
appellative transitions. ‘Catarrhal’ was replaced by
terms that reflected with increasing precision the
mode of disease acquisition or the aetiology; such
terms (other than ‘infectious’) were: ‘infective’,
‘common infective’, ‘non-spirochaetal’, ‘epidemic’,
and finally ‘ virus’ or ‘ viral’. The two last-mentioned
terms were presumptive, since no viruses had yet been
identified. As for ‘jaundice’, it was replaced with
‘hepatitis’, acknowledging that anicteric forms of the
disease exist [53]. Although infectious hepatitis con￾noted the short-incubation form that was associated
with faecal–oral (or enteric) transmission and rec￾ognized in waterborne outbreaks [54], it could refer
generically to both short- and long-incubation forms
[55]. Whether the causative agent comprised strains of
770 C.-G. Teo

one organism or separate organisms [36, 51] was re￾solved after intensive serological studies and then
electron microscopy characterized the agent of the
short-incubation disease and that of the long￾incubation disease to be distinct viruses, now known
as hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus
(HBV), respectively. More years intervened before
two other parenterally transmitted viruses, hepatitis C
virus (HCV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV), and one
other enterically transmitted virus, hepatitis E virus
(HEV), were identified [56–60].
Attribution of epidemics to hepatitis E
All the outbreaks so far described are more likely than
not due to hepatitis E. The defining characteristic of a
hepatitis E epidemic is its undue lethality for pregnant
women, especially those who have entered the later
stages of gestation [61]. Although all the five known
agents of viral hepatitis can induce FHF in the in￾fected host, observational studies have shown that in
pregnant women, hepatitis A – whether occurring
sporadically [62–65] or epidemically [66, 67] – gives
rise to no or very low mortality rates, and that deaths
from FHF following acute hepatitis B either are ab￾sent or occur at significantly marginal rates compared
to hepatitis E [63, 68, 69]. As for hepatitis C and D, no
tendency for pregnant women to develop FHF after
their acquisition has yet been reported [70]. Similarly,
non-viral hepatitides that can expand into epidemics
of jaundice, such as yellow fever [71], leptospirosis
[47] and louse-borne relapsing fever [72] do not share
that predilection. Nor do other diseases for which
jaundice could present although less prominently, e.g.
typhoid, typhus, dengue and malaria [73]. Hepatitis E
is therefore pre-eminent among infectious diseases in
predisposing pregnant women to FHF [61].
Hepatotoxins, too, can potentially result in
community-wide outbreaks of jaundice and liver fail￾ure [74] but none was wont to bring about morbidities
in pregnant women. A possible exception is tetra￾cycline which in the 1960s tended to be administered
intravenously in large doses to pregnant women with
pyelonephritis, a practice that led to reports of excess
deaths from liver failure [75]. This antibiotic did not
exist when the jaundice epidemics so far described
occurred.
A second characteristic of hepatitis E is that during
community outbreaks, clinical attack rates are highest
among adolescents and young adults than children
and older adults [76]. By contrast, when hepatitis
A strikes a community, peak clinical attack rates tend
to be among young children [56, 77]. A distinction
between the two enterically transmitted viral hepa￾titides may therefore be made. That can be blurred,
however, if a jaundice outbreak is associated with
HAV and HEV co-transmission [77–85] or if a hepa￾titis E outbreak occurs in a locality where HAV infec￾tion is highly endemic [86–88]. Furthermore, peak
attack rates of hepatitis A can shift from children to
young adults, but that shift is a relatively recent
phenomenon [89, 90]. Still, other jaundice epidemics
have been encountered which although primarily
striking adults are associated with neither HAV
transmission nor severe disease in pregnant women
[91–94]; they may be caused by yet undiscovered
icterogenic agents.
These limitations notwithstanding, a consideration
of whether the distinguishing characteristics of hepa￾titis E, i.e. high attack rates in young adults and
deaths in pregnant women, are revealed in historical
documentations of jaundice epidemics permits any
outbreak to be classified – along a gradation of cer￾tainty that the reports pertain to hepatitis E – as be￾longing to one three classes: class I (plausible), class II
(possible), and class III (probable) (Table 1). Each of
the epidemics represented in Figures 1–3 has been
assigned a class following this classification scheme.
Epidemic escalations
After an apparent lull between the two world wars,
reports of jaundice epidemics that were peculiarly
lethal to pregnant women resurfaced. A change in
trend to these outbreaks is perceptible: they were be￾ing reported more frequently; the venues were shifting
eastward and southward; and their scale grew. All the
outbreaks are readily assignable to class II or class III.
Heralding this new era was a small cluster in 1935 in
Hemet, Lebanon, which led to two fatalities, both in
pregnant women [95]. A year later and over a period
of 16 months, all but one of 14 jaundiced pregnant
women who were admitted with coma to the univer￾sity hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, died (Fig. 1) [96].
Attending obstetricians were, like their European
predecessors, mystified by the exclusivity of deaths
among pregnant women. As Liepmann (1938) re￾counted:
But the strangest thing to our epidemic is, that in a time of
widespread jaundice throughout the city and in all hospitals
in Istanbul, only the pregnant women were affected by acute
yellow atrophy, and non-pregnant women and men did not
suffer it [97].
Global epidemic history of hepatitis E 771
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268811002925 Published online by Cambridge University Press

In Palestine, 1941, the first of a succession of hepatitis
epidemics erupted, coinciding with the onset of mass
immigration into the region. It broke out in detention
camps and involved mainly young adults [98].
Pregnant women were noted to bear the brunt of
severe hepatic disease and of deaths from acute yellow
atrophy [99, 100] but count data were not reported.
More indicative of hepatitis E was an outbreak that
followed which generated steep increases in the num￾ber of jaundiced pregnant women admitted to hos￾pitals in Tel-Aviv between 1942 and 1944, and in
Jerusalem between 1944 and 1946, with case-fatality
rates (CFRs) of 14% and 19%, respectively [101, 102]
(Fig. 1). Upsurges in immigration after the founding
of Israel brought about even more dramatic rises in
the frequency and extent of hepatitis epidemics [103].
A notable outbreak that smouldered in the north in
the 1950s led to excess hospital admissions of jaun￾diced pregnant women in Haifa, the CFR being about
9% [104] (Fig. 2). Predating it was a series from
neighbouring Jezreel and Afula involving 55 cases
observed sporadically over 10 years of which nine
cases were fatal [105]. Notifications in Israel of such
sporadic and outbreak occurrences subsequently
ceased [106].
Along the southern Mediterranean littoral arose a
succession of reports of fatal jaundice in pregnant
women: first from Tunisia (from 1945) [107, 108]
thereafter Algeria (from 1952) [109, 110] and then
Morocco (from 1958) [111] (Fig. 1). Somewhat later,
in 1968 and 1970, similar reports came from Libya
[112, 113]. In all these, jaundice in the wider com￾munity was also noted, but deaths in males and non￾pregnant women were seldom observed. Features
common to the illness suffered by pregnant women
were: previous paucity of occurrences as perceived
by the reporting physicians; onset during the third
trimester; susceptibility of both native and expatriate
women; fulminant course leading up to encepha￾lopathy; high rates of fetal loss; and pathological
findings redolent of classic acute yellow atrophy.
Light microscopy of post-mortem or biopsy liver
samples revealed frank hepatocytic necrosis, which
was distinct from appearances associated with ges￾tational conditions affecting the liver that could oc￾casionally be fatal such as hyperemesis gravidarum,
eclampsia and acute fatty liver of pregnancy [114].
These various features are consistent with hepatitis E
being newly introduced to the region. By the end of
the second decade following the Second World War,
endemicity was firmly established: subsequent reports
would relate to sporadic disease mainly [115–121],
whereas those related to outbreaks became occasional
[118, 122, 123].
The aforementioned class II or III epidemics struck
the Maghreb [107–113] when epidemics of jaundice
were breaking out among soldiers [124, 125], mostly
deployed from French Equatorial Africa [126]. As the
magnitude of the outbreaks and the extent of fulmi￾nant disease and cirrhosis among the military cases
varied [124, 125, 127] and because no women were
involved, it is not possible to assess the contribution
of hepatitis E. Confounding that difficulty was the
encroaching endemicity of parenterally transmitted
hepatitis in the African continent, associated with
mass vaccinations, widespread availability of syringe￾mediated treatment for diseases such as yaws, syphilis
and schistosomiasis, and of myriad other injection￾based therapies including blood transfusions and
plasma infusions administered to civilian and military
populations [128–130]. The natural histories of the
new forms of viral hepatitis were often grave [128,
131] which contrasted with the essentially benign
nature of epidemic catarrhal jaundice (insofar as it

could be distinguished from leptospirosis, yellow
fever and relapsing fever) that had episodically been
reported from Africa since the First World War
[129, 132]. Whether the higher morbidity and mor￾tality rates were linked to dissemination of new and
more virulent strains of HBV or HCV, or to HDV
super- or co-infection of people with persistent HBV
infection remains uncertain [50]. Nonetheless, a class
II hepatitis E-like epidemic in 1958 was reported from
Belgian Congo [133], probably a massive one as >700
cases of jaundice were hospitalized (Fig. 1).
The striking observations reported from northern
Africa prompted retrospective observational studies
in Dakar, Senegal [134, 135]. A major investigation of
>400 jaundiced patients admitted to a single hospital
between 1954 and 1959 found a CFR from acute
hepatic failure of 24% in pregnant women, contrast￾ing with 11% in non-pregnant women [135]. These
findings are suggestive of hepatitis E, but in an en￾demic setting, as no community epidemics of jaundice
were being reported. The situation is mirrored in
Accra, Ghana, where over a 1-year period in 1963,
and in the absence of a concurrent epidemic, hospi￾talized cases of presumptive viral hepatitis were stud￾ied; the clinical attack rate and the incidence rate of
coma were both four times higher in pregnant than
non-pregnant women [136]. From Nigeria was re￾ported a 1960 epidemic of jaundice that particularly
afflicted pregnant women [136, 137] but further in￾formation is unavailable. Near-contemporaneous,

maternal mortality, accounting for 20% of non￾obstetric deaths in a 1957–1960 series [138] and 8% of
all deaths in a 1961–1968 series [139].
Reports of epidemics during the immediate decades
after the Second World War in eastern and southern
Africa did not mention deaths in pregnant women
[129, 132, 140] nor did those of studies into sporadic
viral hepatitis [141, 142]. An audit of viral hepatitis in
pregnancy observed between 1957 and 1967 in a
Johannesburg hospital uncovered only 12 cases, none
fatal [143]. Then, from 1974 to 1975, a steep rise was
observed in the number of jaundiced women admitted
to the obstetric wards in Pietermaritzburg [144]. The
CFR was 44%, and all the deaths followed hepatic
coma (Fig. 2). Admissions of jaundiced patients to the
medical wards showed a corresponding rise, pointing
to a class III epidemic in the environs.
Meanwhile, a spate of class II and III epidemics
befell several republics and provinces of what was
then Yugoslavia. Occurring in the early 1960s and
centered on Prizren (in Serbia) [145], Mitrovica (in
Kosovo) [146], an unidentified town in Bosnia [147],
and Bihac (also in Bosnia) [148], they generated
hospital-based CFRs in pregnant women that were
unusually high, ranging from 28% to 43% (Fig. 2).
Cases and deaths were almost exclusive to the poorer,
Muslim communities. Representing the last of their
kind in Europe, these epidemics appeared during a
period when numerous waterborne outbreaks of
jaundice erupted across the federation [149].
Elsewhere, other jaundice epidemics associated
with pregnancy deaths were being reported. In the
Indian subcontinent there was a 1949 cluster of in￾patient cases outstanding for its 65% CFR among
pregnant women [150] (Fig. 2). It arose from an epi￾demic, whose magnitude is unknown, which affected
villages around Agra. Six years later, a much larger
outbreak hit Delhi: within 8 weeks, >250 people were
dead, with almost half of them pregnant [151] (Fig. 2).
Of 1200 pregnant women notified as cases, the
obstetric history of 339 was known, and of these, 101
delivered stillbirths or infants who died as neonates
[152]. Before the Agra and Delhi outbreaks, jaundice
epidemics were already being reported; nevertheless,
none except the 1906 cluster (27) (Fig. 1) was recorded
to have particularly killed pregnant women [52, 153,
154]. After the Delhi outbreak, more reports of class
III epidemics ensued. Most affected relatively smaller
conurbations [155–158] but in 1973, an epidemic
swept over the Kathmandu valley in Nepal [159]
(Fig. 2). Shrestha & Maila, who had to face up to
en masse hospital admissions that resulted, wrote a
moving account of toiling pregnant women being
felled by hepatitis E gone rampant:
Twenty-six were brought in coma. They gave history of
jaundice of short duration of 2 to 7 days, but were still
working till they suddenly became drowsy and comatose
and brought to hospital. Of these, 3 were not aware of
the disease and were still working the field till they were
suddenly struck by hepatic encephalopathy [160].
The abrupt onset of FHF and its fatal outcome likely
attenuate the accuracy by which CFRs relating to
hepatitis E in pregnant women are calculated. Those
who perish without having been admitted to the hos￾pital or otherwise become notified would not have
been counted. Also influencing the derivation of the
CFR numerator is how the gestational status of the
deceased is ascertained: whereas cases who are visibly
pregnant would be identified, those in early pregnancy
might not. The epidemic scale and intensity bear on
both the numerator and denominator. Larger epi￾demics tend to mandate sample field-surveys, the
morbidity and mortality data collected being then
used to estimate the CFR [151, 156, 158, 161–166].
Such crude estimations would be unnecessary for
small outbreaks since cases and deaths could be
counted more closely or notified more directly.
Finally, CFRs with denominators based on morbidity
of community cases are probably lower than those
based on morbidity of hospital inpatients as the latter
would tend to capture the severer cases. To aid com￾parative assessments of CFRs, morbidity and mor￾tality counts in Figures 1–4 are denoted according to
whether they originated from the hospital (H) or the
community (C).
Widening epidemic contexts
Retrospective serological testing for HAV and HBV
in patients who developed jaundice during water￾borne epidemics in India [167] revealed that they
contracted what came to be known as enterically
transmitted non-A, non-B (ET-NANB) hepatitis [58].
ET-NANB hepatitis was, in turn, determined by later
serological testing for anti-HEV antibodies to be
mostly hepatitis E [94, 168–170]. The Indian subcon￾tinent has continued to host many epidemics of ET￾NANB hepatitis and hepatitis E. Outbreaks have
erupted across India, Nepal, Burma, Pakistan and
Bangladesh, in both urban [77, 78, 84, 86, 157, 158,
162, 164, 166, 171–176] and rural [174, 177–180] set￾tings (Figs 2–4). HEV strains associated with these
774 C.-G. Teo

outbreaks, whenever characterized, belonged to geno￾type 1, there being altogether four genotypes (1–4)
that infect humans [181]. A very severe epidemic
affected about 200 villages in the Kashmir valley in
1978 and 1979. It led to an estimated 600 deaths, two￾thirds in pregnant women [161, 168, 171]. Some cases
manifested a cholestatic form of disease similar to
that in pregnant women with FHF in Dakar, Delhi
and Accra [135, 182, 183]. A larger epidemic visited
the city of Kanpur during 1992 [164]. The CFR for
pregnant women there (27%) was reportedly less than
in Kashmir (73%), a disparity ascribable to mortality
data for Kanpur having been based on hospital￾inpatient counts and those for Kashmir projected
from data obtained during a sample survey [161, 171].
Nonetheless, the possibility is raised that outbreaks
were caused by HEV strains of varying virulence.
Indeed, a few confirmed hepatitis E outbreaks have
been documented for which deaths when inquired
into were absent [184] or not found among pregnant
women [185–188].
Outbreaks apart, numerous case-series have been
published [63, 68, 69, 189–215] as well as autopsy re￾views [216] and audits [217, 218] linking viral hepa￾titis, ET-NANB hepatitis and hepatitis E with
pronounced maternal mortality rates. Fetal compli￾cations have also been frequent [206, 207, 209–211,
215]. More recent, verbally reported autopsy data
from population-based studies in Bangladesh reveal
20% of all maternal deaths and 10% of all neonatal
deaths to be associated with jaundice in pregnant
women, HEV being the chief suspect [219].
Collectively, these reports indicate that for the last
half century, hepatitis E in south Asia – whether epi￾demic or sporadic – has imposed enormous morbidity
and mortality burdens on pregnant women and their
infants in excess of that on the general population
[220, 221].
Reports from Central Asia of epidemic hepatitis,
also called Botkin’s disease [222] were common in the
immediate decades after the Second World War.
Many waterborne epidemics were likely hepatitis A in
view of the high clinical attack rates in children
[222–225]. Association with fatal FHF in pregnant
women was specifically documented for two out￾breaks: one outbreak (magnitude unknown) struck
an agricultural area in southern Kazakhstan during
the 1950s and elicited a CFR in hospitalized pregnant
women of 10% [29] (Fig. 1); the other was in
Kirgizstan between 1956 and 1957 with a CFR of 16%
[62]. Over this period, CFRs reported for pregnant
women with sporadic Botkin’s disease in Central Asia
(about 4%) [62, 226] were similar to those in Russia
(between 1% and 6%) [62, 227–231]. Towards the
end of the 1980s a succession of class III ET-NANB
hepatitis epidemics struck Central Asia. These hit:
Tashauz province, Turkmenistan (1984, and then
1985) [232–234]; southern Uzbekistan (1986) [79, 235];
the city of Leninabad, Tajikistan (1986) [83, 236];
eastern Uzbekistan (1987) [235]; and Inner Tien Shan,
Kirgizstan (1987) [93] (Fig. 3). Typically autumnal in
onset, lasting until winter and each affecting between
10 000 and 30 000 people [237], they were particularly
lethal to pregnant women, the CFRs (as estimated
from sample surveys) ranging from 7% to 27%. Later
testing of sera sampled from the cases confirmed that
all the epidemics were hepatitis E [93, 234, 235, 237]
and caused by HEV genotype 1 [237]. Thereafter, ex￾cept for a few scattered outbreaks [83, 227], large￾scale epidemics abated. To date, sporadic hepatitis E
continues to be observed [83, 235, 238].
Attendant to the Tien Shan outbreak [93] were two
consecutive class III ET-NANB epidemics that
blighted neighbouring Xinjiang, China, in the
autumns of 1987 and 1988. Together, they afflicted
nearly 120 000 people (mostly Uighurs) in 23 counties
and towns across three prefectures [239], yielding a
CFR for pregnant women of 13% (Fig. 3). These
occurrences also were later confirmed to be hepatitis
E and caused by HEV genotype 1 [240]. Similar, but
lesser-intensity outbreaks had earlier [241] and since
[242] struck Xinjiang. In the rest of China and in
Mongolia, prior ET-NANB hepatitis outbreaks had
been described [243] although details are unavailable.
Even earlier documentations from China revealed
extensive jaundice epidemics in the 1920s but preg￾nant women were not noted to be especially ill [244,
245]. A jaundice-in-pregnancy series from Taiwan
covering cases observed from 1961 to 1974 found a
14% CFR associated with viral hepatitis [246]. An
investigation in 1962 of Botkin’s disease in pregnant
women based in Ulan Bator reported a strikingly high
CFR of 81% [247]; whether this was generated in the
course of an outbreak is unclear. Serologically con￾firmed HEV infection is now infrequent in Mongolia
[248]. In China, however, sporadic HEV infection
and FHF still occur in pregnant women [249–251].
A shift in HEV endemicity from genotype 1 to geno￾type 4 (and to a lesser extent, to genotype 3) is being
observed [252] so a decline in the rates of sporadic
hepatitis E-related FHF in pregnant women may
follow; genotypes 3 and 4, unlike genotype 1,
Global epidemic history of hepatitis E 775
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268811002925 Published online by Cambridge University Press

are not closely associated with FHF in younger
adults [61].
Four ET-NANB hepatitis or hepatitis E outbreaks
have so far been reported from Southeast Asia:
two which hit successively one district in West
Kalimantan, Indonesia (1987 and 1991) [253, 254];
one in southwestern Vietnam (1994) [255]; and most
recently one in Java, Indonesia (1998) [256]. All the
epidemic sites were riverine villages. Death rates
were pronounced among pregnant women in the
Kalimantan epidemics, the CFR calculated from the
1991 outbreak being 26% (Fig. 4). They were not
encountered in the Vietnamese and Javan outbreaks,
although surveillance for post-jaundice outcomes in
pregnant women was in place. For the rest of
Southeast Asia and in East Asia, sporadic hepatitis E
is being reported but not severe disease in pregnant
women [73, 257–261]. In Japan, hepatitis E-associated
FHF has been observed; peculiarly, it afflicts pre￾dominantly older people, reflecting the endemicity of
HEV genotypes 3 and 4 rather than genotype 1 [76].
In Mecca during 1958–1960, upsurges in admis￾sions for jaundice to hospitals pointed to an ongoing
class II outbreak but it was relatively benign (Fig. 2)
[262]. Case-series studies of sporadic viral hepatitis
conducted in other regions in the Middle East re￾vealed variable rates of FHF and ensuing mortality in
pregnant women [263–266]. Given the lack of specific
diagnostic testing, it cannot be excluded that such
variation in rates reflects regional differences in en￾demicity of the hepatitis viruses. A more recent, pro￾spective study of HEV infection in the United Arab
Emirates found that 21% of women screened ante￾natally to be viraemic developed FHF as pregnancy
progressed [267] specifically associating HEV with
detrimental maternal outcomes.

Reports of localized ET-NANB hepatitis epidemics
from Mexico [87] (caused by HEV genotype 2 [268])
and similar-scale but more frequent hepatitis E out￾breaks from Cuba [85, 269] (caused by genotype 1)
have not noted fatalities in pregnant women. Earlier
reports of sporadic viral hepatitis in pregnant women
from Brazil [270] and Mexico [271, 272] showed
deaths from hepatic failure, but without specific di￾agnostic testing attribution to hepatitis E is tenuous.
Although sporadic hepatitis E has since been ident￾ified in Central and South America [85, 273–275],
there is little evidence to link it with severe maternal
illness [276].
Africa has continued to provide settings from
which class III ET-NANB hepatitis and hepatitis E
epidemics frequently break out. The largest out￾break lasted from 1988 to 1989 and affected >140
villages along the Shebeli River in Somalia [277].
Mortalities in the general and pregnant popu￾lations – however incompletely determined given
the widespread and protracted nature of the
epidemic – were appreciable (Fig. 4). Other outbreaks
reported are clustered around urban centers: Medea,
Algeria (1980–1981) [122]; Rundu, Namibia (1983
[278] and then 1995 [279]); Tortiya, Coˆte d’Ivoire
(1982–1984) [280]; Maun, Botswana (1985) [281];
Djibouti (1993) [81] and Bangui, Central African
Republic (2002) [282]. Although relatively circum￾scribed and brief, FHF-associated fatalities in preg￾nant women were noted (Figs 3 and 4). For the 1995
Namibian outbreak no pregnant women died al￾though FHF was observed [279]. The transmitting
HEV was identified as genotype 2 [283] contrasting
with genotype 1 that was associated with the earlier
outbreak [278]. Refugee camps have been another,
more recent epidemic setting. Outbreaks have oc￾curred among displaced people held in camps situated
in Somalia [284], Kenya [285], Sudan [165, 284] and
Uganda [286]. Owing to the dense concentration
of people being accommodated, the outbreaks
were larger than those in the cities and towns
[81, 122, 278–282]; correspondingly, death counts in
pregnant women were higher (Figs 3 and 4). HEV
infection remains endemic across much of Africa, as
exemplified by findings from the many seroincidence
studies conducted [122, 287–293]. Sporadic trans￾missions still pose fatal risk to pregnant women
[122, 294–299].

Implications
The narrative as assembled here dates back to the
closing years of the 18th century, and traces the shift
of sites of epidemic jaundice from Western Europe,
the Caribbean, USA and Australia to Eastern
Europe, Central and South Asia, and Africa.
Accompanying that widening geographical reach is
an increasing frequency and magnitude of the out￾breaks. This pattern of dispersal could plausibly be an
artifact of Western colonization, as outbreaks were
reported by Western observers inquiring into diseases
first at home, then in the colonies as territories were
being possessed [300, 301], and thereafter – during the
post-colonial period – reported by native observers.
Whether from expatriate or indigenous reporting, the
paucity of pregnancy deaths in documentations of
jaundice epidemics from South Asia and Africa dur￾ing the pre-Second World War 20th century [52, 129,
131, 132, 153, 154] is striking. Nonetheless, the possi￾bility that there were outbreaks that went unnoticed
or unrecorded cannot be excluded. Gaps in the nar￾rative may also be due to limitations in the reach of
this literature review, and missing or inaccessible re￾cords [28, 29, 78, 137, 243].
Other than an artifact of reporting, the epidemic
history of hepatitis E here constructed and the pattern
of diffusion inferred could reflect the manner by
which the virulence of HEV for humans has changed
over the last two centuries. All serologically con￾firmed hepatitis E outbreaks associated with preg￾nancy deaths (Fig. 4) are caused by HEV strains
belonging to genotype 1, not the other genotypes. The
class I, II and III and the ET-NANB hepatitis epi￾demics (Figs 1–3) may be presumed to be caused by
HEV genotype 1 too. The time of appearance of the
pre-20th century class I and II epidemics (Fig. 1) co￾incides with the time when HEV genotype 1 emerged
from its putative immediate ancestor about 100–200
years ago, as estimated by recent molecular-clock
analyses [302]. Moreover, the dramatic increase in the
frequency and scale of post-Second World War class
II and III, ET-NANB hepatitis and hepatitis E epi￾demics (Figs 1–4) corresponds to a period when there
was a burst of genetic diversity in genotype 1 strains.
How these strains lead to severe hepatic disease in the
pregnant remains unknown [61]. Although studies of
HEV-infected pregnant women in India have found
higher levels of oestrogen, progesterone and b-human
choriogonadotrophin in the blood [303] and higher
DNA-binding activity of NF-kB in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and liver [304] of patients with
FHF compared to those without FHF, the manner by
which host factors interact with HEV in influencing
the pathogenesis of FHF requires clarification.
The narrative also is one of tragedy in maternal and
child health continuing into modern times, particu￾larly for South Asia and Africa. To avert that tragedy
requires universalizing access to drinking water and
basic sanitation [305], in itself an arduous undertaking
[306]. Necessarily complementing efforts to meet this
challenge is the implementation of measures that are
directed specifically to protect against or mitigate the
pernicious outcome of HEV infection in pregnant
women. Providing these women with antiviral
prophylaxis during an epidemic is not yet an option.
Vaccination is a more pre-emptive and now an
achievable means to prophylaxis. Two vaccines have
completed clinical and safety efficacy trials [249, 307].
Whereas the development of one vaccine [307] has
stopped [308], the production of the other vaccine
[249] is progressing and market approval is being
sought. Sufficient quantities could soon be available
to immunize communities where epidemics have
arisen and HEV genotype 1 is endemic. It would then
be possible to determine its efficacy against HEV in￾fection and FHF in vaccinees who are or subsequently
become pregnant, along with adverse obstetric and
fetal outcomes that may ensue.
