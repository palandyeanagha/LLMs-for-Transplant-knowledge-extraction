Abstract
In parallel with the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome
globally, nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) disease is the most
common chronic liver disease in Western countries and non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become increasingly
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent studies have
identified NASH as the most rapidly growing indication for liver
transplantation (LT). As a hepatic manifestation of the meta￾bolic syndrome, NAFL disease can be histologically divided into
NAFL and NASH. NAFL is considered a benign condition, with
histological changes of hepatocyte steatosis but without evi￾dence of hepatocellular injury or fibrosis. This is distinct from
NASH, which is characterized by hepatocyte ballooning and
inflammation, and which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. As for any other
end-stage liver disease, LT is a curative option for NASH after
the onset of decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carci￾noma. Although some studies have suggested increased rates
of sepsis and cardiovascular complications in the immediate
postoperative period, the long-term posttransplant survival of
NASH cases is similar to other indications for LT. Recurrence
of NAFL following LT is common and can be challenging,
although recurrence rates of NASH are lower. The persistence
or progression of metabolic syndrome components after LT are
likely responsible for NASH recurrence in transplanted liver.
Therefore, while maintaining access to LT is important, con￾certed effort to address the modifiable risk factors and develop
effective screening strategies to identify early stages of disease
are paramount to effectively tackle this growing epidemic.

Introduction
As the prevalence of obesity increases worldwide, related
complications including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and
metabolic syndrome are increasing as well.1 Insulin resist￾ance and metabolic alterations are closely associated with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). As such, NAFLD is
sometimes known as the “hepatic manifestation” of the met￾abolic syndrome and mirrors the rising rates of hyperlipide￾mia, obesity, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and/
or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).2,3 Because of the associ￾ation with metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is currently one of the
most common chronic liver diseases in Western countries.
NAFLD is also emerging as a major cause of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), rising at a rate higher than any other etiol￾ogy of liver disease.1,4–6
NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases, ranging from
fatty liver without inflammation to nonalcoholic steatohepa￾titis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Per the latest definition by the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (com￾monly known as AASLD), NAFLD entails two components:
1) evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology; and
2) exclusion of other etiologies for hepatic steatosis including
significant alcohol consumption, medication adverse effect,
and/or hereditary disorders.7 Histologically, NAFLD can be
further subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or
NASH. NAFL is defined as the presence of greater than or
equal to 5% hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury
in the form of hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis. NASH, on
the other hand, entails greater than or equal to 5% hepatic
steatosis with inflammation and hepatocyte injury with or
without fibrosis. Further progression of disease into cirrhosis
is termed NASH cirrhosis and can result in HCC and liver
failure.
Pathogenesis
While hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are associ￾ated hallmarks of NAFLD, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is not

fully elucidated. Questions remain regarding the factors
underlying inflammation and disease progression. The devel￾opment of steatosis in the liver is the first step, which is
associated with a state of chronic hepatic inflammation.8
In vivo studies of mice have shown that a high fat diet leads
to an over-expression of proinflammatory markers such as
nuclear factor-kappa B as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b.
9–11 Inflammation from
myeloid cells, such as Kupffer cells, may also play a large
part in obesity-induced insulin resistance.11 Additionally,
studies have also demonstrated genetic modifiers for devel￾opment of NAFLD.
A genome-wide association study found that the rs738409[G]
allele in PNPLA3 was strongly associated with increased
hepatic fat levels and hepatic inflammation.12 This allele was
most common in Hispanics, and allelic homozygosity was
associated with hepatic fat levels more than twice as high
as in noncarriers. Another study in an Eastern European
population and published in March 2017 found PNPLA3
rs738409 to be associated with increased risk of developing
fibrosis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, p = 0.001) and cirrhosis
(OR = 1.92, p < 0.005).13 Recent studies have confirmed
the interplay between genetic predispositions and environ￾mental factors. A study published in June 2017 showed that
the three sequence variants encoding PNPLA3-I148M,
TM6SF2-E167K and GCKR-P446L are significantly associated
with NAFLD.14
Epidemiology
The true prevalence of NAFLD is unknown. Most of the
available data is from epidemiological estimates. Younossi
et al.,
1 using a meta-analysis of 86 studies with a combined
sample size of 8,515,431 from 22 countries, estimated that
the global NAFLD prevalence is 25% (95% confidence interval
(CI): 22–29%; p < 0.05). The pooled data showed that
NAFLD is highly prevalent in all continents, but the highest
rates have been reported from South America (31%) and
the Middle East (32%), followed by Asia (27%), the USA
(25.8%), and Europe (23%).1 Prevalence of NASH is esti￾mated to range from 1.5% to 6%.1,15–17 In their studies,
pooled NASH prevalence amongst NAFLD patients undergoing
biopsy was 59.1% (95%CI: 55.16–94.28).1 However, the
estimates of NASH prevalence and fibrosis progression rates
among individuals with NAFLD are limited by the largely ret￾rospective methodology used in numerous studies and the
limitations in the screening guideline consensus.1,18–23
Most patients are diagnosed with NAFLD between the fourth
and fifth decade of life.24 Studies have also reported mixed
results regarding sex-related predominance, with earlier
studies suggesting a female predominance (65–83%).24
However, in a 2018 study using a cross-sectional survey
based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (commonly known as NHANES) III, sex distribution
of NAFLD varied by age group.23 The lowest male-to-female
prevalence (0.94) was seen in individuals less than 30 years
old, while the highest ratio (1.31) was seen in individuals aged
40–49 years. The prevalence of NAFLD also has significant
ethnic variations. A study of hepatic triglyceride levels of
2,287 individuals from a USA population-based sample found
that the highest rate of NAFLD was seen in Hispanics (45%),
followed by non-Hispanic whites (33%); the lowest prevalence
was seen in African Americans (24%).25 The higher rates of
NAFLD in Hispanics were associated with correspondingly
higher rates of obesity and insulin resistance in this group.
These observed differences are likely multifactorial and
related to a combination of genetic and environmental
factors.26,27
Using data from the NHANES III, the incidence of NAFLD in
2015 was projected to be around 3.44 million.23 However,
that annual incidence is estimated to decrease by more than
30% in the next decade, which some authors attribute to a
decrease in the overall incidence of obesity in the general
population.23,28 Although a decrease in the incidence is
expected to occur, the prevalence will continue to rise.17,23
Due to the increased prevalence of NAFL, the prevalence of
NASH is expected to increase as well.1,4,23 Estes et al.23 esti￾mate that the proportion of NAFL cases that progress to NASH
will increase from 20% to 27% by 2030. Similarly, incident
decompensated cirrhosis is predicted to increase by 168%,
from 39,230 cases annually in 2015 to 105,430 cases in
2030. The corresponding burden of NASH cirrhosis on liver
transplantation (LT) is expected to increase by 59%.23
Numerous recent studies have reported that NASH-related
cirrhosis is the most rapidly growing indication for LT in the
USA.29–32
Changing epidemiology landscape of chronic liver
diseases and LT trends
The prevalence of NAFLD continues to increase, and it is
expected that NASH-related end-stage liver disease (ESLD)
will become the leading indication for LT over the next several
decades.1,4,29,30,33 Studies have demonstrated a dispropor￾tionate increase in NASH-related cirrhosis as an indication
for LT relative to other etiologies.31,33 In 2017, Cholankeril
et al.,
31 using data from the United Network for Organ
Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(commonly known as UNOS/OPTN) database, reported a
162% increase in LT secondary to NASH from 2003 to 2014,
while LT due to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and hepatitis C
virus (HCV) only increased by 54% and 33% respectively. As
the burden of NASH-related ESLD on the wait-list continues to
rapidly grow, the risk of wait-list removal secondary to death or
progression of comorbidities increases.34
According to Wong et al.,
30 from 2004–2013, NASH￾related disease was the second leading etiology of liver
disease among adults on the LT wait-list in the USA. During
this period, the number of new wait-list listings increased by
170%. From 2007 to 2015, the absolute number of NASH￾related listings on the UNOS registry increased each year.35
In contrast, during the same period, new waitlist registrations
for ALD increased 45% and HCV by a mere 14%, whereas
HCV/ALD decreased by 9%, reflecting the changing epide￾miological landscape for LT.30 Importantly, since the advent
of highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents in 2013, HCV
disease burden and need for LT have decreased dramatically.
Wong et al.30 also demonstrated worse outcomes for 90-day
wait-list survival for NASH, when compared to HCV, HCV/ALD,
and ALD.
Despite higher wait-list mortality in patients with ALD,
when adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, presence of
T2DM, model for end-stage liver disease score, ascites, and
concurrent HCC using multivariate analysis modeling, ALD
patients demonstrated increased 90-day wait-list survival
compared to those with NASH (OR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.67–
0.89, p < 0.001). Wait-list survival at 1-year was similar for
ALD patients showing superior survival when compared to
Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 420–424 421
Liu A. et al: NAFLD and liver transplantation

NASH patients (OR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.66–0.83, p < 0.001).30
Furthermore, among NASH patients awaiting LT, a 2017 study
found that morbid obesity and T2DM are associated with
higher rates of wait-list removal or mortality.36 When compar￾ing probabilities of receiving a liver transplant, patients with
NASH were less likely to undergo LT.30 Compared to NASH,
patients with HCV, ALD, and HCV/ALD were more likely to
undergo LT within 90 days and 1 year of being on the wait￾list registry. Additionally, a 2017 study by Stine et al.37
showed that those with high-risk NASH (as defined by age
>60 years, body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2
, hypertension
(HTN), and T2DM), were at a higher risk of developing pre￾transplant portal vein thrombosis compared to non-NASH
patients (OR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.60–2.76).
Outcomes of LT for NASH-related cirrhosis
In patients undergoing LT for NASH-related cirrhosis, long￾term mortality outcomes are similar to those who undergo LT
for other etiologies, such as ALD and HCV.33,38,39 Reported
1-year posttransplant survival is approximately 79–90%,
3-year survival is 82–83%, and 5-year survival is 72–
78%.31,33,38,40 Malik et al.40 performed a subanalysis of
patients who died within the first year of transplantation and
found that these patients were more likely to be of age
$60 years, BMI $30 kg/m2
, and have pretransplant HTN
and T2DM. In this higher-risk group, the 30-day mortality and
1-year mortality were 31% and 50%, respectively. Cause of
death in NASH patients posttransplant was primarily infection
(57.1%), statistically significantly higher when compared to
other indications for LT.40
A meta-analysis in 2014 by Wang et al.41 also found
that patients with NASH had a greater risk of death from car￾diovascular complications (OR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.01–2.70,
p = 0.05). The same risk factors of metabolic syndrome
that predispose patients to NAFLD, including obesity, T2DM,
hyperlipidemia and HTN, are also risk factors for developing
coronary artery disease. It is also well established that these
risk factors are associated with a higher incidence of cardiac
events following any type of surgery and that the risk of infec￾tion is increased in patients with T2DM.42–44 Despite these
known risk factors, recent studies have shown that survival
rates and long-term outcomes are similar among ALD, HCV,
and NASH-related cirrhosis.41 In their meta-analysis includ￾ing 717 patients with NASH and 3,520 without NASH, Wang
et al.41 also found that patient mortality after transplant was
similar between NASH recipients and control subjects. The
analysis was based on the survival rates for the primary
indication of NASH-related ESLD versus nonNASH-related
ESLD (including ALD and HCV), at years 1, 3, and 5 posttrans￾plantation (OR at 1-year postLT = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.59–1.00,
p = 0.05; OR at 3-years postLT = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.67–1.40,
p = 0.86; OR at 5-years postLT = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.77–1.56,
p = 0.63).41
In addition, in a retrospective cohort study in 2017
comparing postLT outcomes in NASH, HCV, and ALD, patients
with NASH had a significantly higher posttransplant survival
compared to patients with HCV (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.75,
95%CI: 0.71–0.79, p < 0.001) and ALD (HR = 0.80, 95%CI:
0.76–0.84, p < 0.001).31
Recurrence of NAFLD after LT
As early as 1997, recurrence of NASH in patients undergoing
LT due to NASH cirrhosis has been reported.45 Generally fol￾lowing LT, patients have a known propensity for weight gain
and obesity. In one study of BMI after LT, among 320 patients
who were not obese prior to transplantation, 21.6% became
obese within 2 years after transplantation.46 The prevalence
of obesity and metabolic syndrome components, including
increased insulin resistance following LT, place patients at
risk for recurrent NAFL and NASH, as well as de novo NAFLD.
Multiple factors have been reported to cause recurrence of
NASH, including obesity, use of steroids, insulin use, HTN,
and hypertriglyceridemia. Contos et al.47 studied patients
with cirrhosis due to NASH undergoing LT and found a mean
BMI increase of 2.2 at a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. In
that study, 12 of 28 (42.9%) patients developed recurrent
steatosis. Only a change in BMI >3 after LT was associated
with recurrent steatosis (OR = 1.5, p < 0.05) on routine sur￾veillance biopsy.47 Similar recurrence rates for NASH have
been described.
A single-center study by Bhati et al.48 analyzed all patients
who received a LT between 1995 and 2013 due to NASH cir￾rhosis or cryptogenic cirrhosis where NASH was suspected. Of
the 34 patients who underwent liver biopsy posttransplant,
88.2% showed NAFLD recurrence, while 41.2% showed
NASH recurrence. Median time from the LT was 47 months.
Evaluation of 56 patients after LT by transient elastography
found recurrence at a similar rate of 87.5%. Median time was
75 months. Further stratification of patients with recurrent
NAFLD on biopsy found that although T2DM prevalence
between patients with recurrence and those without recur￾rence were similar, fasting glucose in those with recurrence
of NAFLD were significantly higher than in those without
disease recurrence (169 ± 81 mg/dL vs. 98 ± 3 mg/dL,
p < 0.01). In the patients followed by transient elastography,
T2DM prevalence was higher in patients with recurrent NAFLD
(81% vs. 51%, p = 0.08). In addition, serum triglyceride
levels were higher in patients with recurrent NAFLD compared
to those without recurrence. The recurrence rates in this
cohort may have been higher relative to other studies of
NAFLD recurrence in patients undergoing LT given the
higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in these patients.
Bhagat et al.49 reported similar high rates of NASH recur￾rence, with 33% of patients transplanted for NASH found to
have evidence of NASH on graft biopsy after 6 months. Lower
rates were reported by Yalamanchili et al.,
50 who performed a
retrospective study from 1986 to 2004 of patients undergoing
LT for NASH-related cirrhosis or cryptogenic cirrhosis. In the
227 patients undergoing follow-up liver biopsy, the calculated
probability of developing hepatic steatosis was 8.2%, 13.6%,
24.9% and 32.9% at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Only
6% of these patients developed NASH.50 In a study by Contos
et al.51 of patients with cirrhosis due to NASH undergoing LT,
3 of 27 (11%) patients showed evidence of steatohepatitis.
Consistent with other studies, serial biopsies demonstrated
progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis. In their study,
cumulative steroid exposure was also found to correlate with
the development of NAFLD.
In contrast, El Atrache et al.52 found no statistically signifi￾cant difference in steroid use, cholesterol and triglyceride
levels, and BMI in patients with NASH recurrence compared
to those without recurrence. In their retrospective, single￾center study of all patients undergoing LT between 1996
422 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 420–424
Liu A. et al: NAFLD and liver transplantation

and 2008, they identified 46 patients with NASH and 37 patients
with cryptogenic cirrhosis. Recurrence rates of NAFLD were
not reported, but 20 patients showed pathological evidence
of NASH with a mean follow-up time of 45.7 months. The mean
time from LT until diagnosis of NASH was 18.2 months.
Studies have also described the development of de novo
NAFLD following LT.53
A retrospective study by Seo et al.54 looked at 68 patients
transplanted at the University of California Davis, of which
84% were due to HCV. In that cohort, 12 patients (18%)
developed de novo NAFL and 6 patients (9%) developed de
novo NASH. Among LT patients with minimal donor steatosis,
8 patients (12%) showed no significant change in steatosis
and 17 patients (25%) showed increased steatosis at postLT
biopsy. An increase in BMI >10% after LT was associated with
development of de novo NAFLD (35%; p < 0.05). In their
study, differences among immunosuppressive regimens, such
as prednisone, calcineurin inhibitors, and sirolimus, that may
increase insulin resistance were not found to be statistically
associated with de novo NAFLD.
On the other hand, a retrospective study of a single-center
LT cohort found that steroid dosage after LT (5.2 ± 2.4 mg/day
vs. 7.1 ± 4.7 mg/day; p = 0.014) was associated with de novo
metabolic syndrome.55 In their cohort of 170 patients, de
novo metabolic syndrome affected 32.9% of all patients,
and was associated with NAFLD (p = 0.001). Further stratifi￾cation of data found that NAFLD rates were higher among
patients who developed metabolic syndrome within 1 year
(23% vs. 50%; p = 0.001) or within 2 years (25.4% vs.
45.8%; p = 0.015) after LT compared with patients without
metabolic changes. In addition to metabolic syndrome risk
factors contributing to recurrence of NAFLD, PNPLA3 genotype
has also been associated with increased rates of recurrence.56
Retransplantation for NASH
Overall, there is a paucity in data regarding retransplanta￾tion for NASH. Despite the relatively high rates of recurrence
of NAFLD and lower rates of recurrent NASH, studies with
5–10 year follow-up have not suggested increased rates of
retransplantation. In the single-center study by El Atrache
et al.,
52 6 patients with NASH recurrence (30%) underwent
retransplantation. Three of those were due to graft failure
secondary to NASH recurrence, while the others were due
to hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 2) and autoimmune hep￾atitis (n = 1). Longer-term studies are needed for further
investigation.
Conclusions
NASH is currently the most rapidly growing indication for LT in
the USA. Although the incidence of NASH-related cirrhosis as
an indication for LT is increasing, wait-list mortality or
removal is higher in NASH patients than for other etiologies.
After LT, the overall survival for NASH patients is similar to
survival rates for other etiologies, although some studies
have noted increased postoperative mortality due to sepsis or
cardiovascular complications. Studies of recurrence rates for
NAFL and NASH following LT have demonstrated trends in risk
factors contributing to recurrence that require close monitor￾ing in posttransplant clinic for early diagnosis of recurrence
and aggressive risk factor modification, including weight loss
and management of T2DM and dyslipidemia. Further, large,
prospective trials are warranted to reach consensus on
identifying specific risk factors and developing effective
strategies to prevent NASH recurrence.
