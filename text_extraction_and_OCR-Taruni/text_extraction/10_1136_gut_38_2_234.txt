Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
present in 5% of patients with ulcerative
colitis, may be associated with pouchitis
after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The
cumulative frequency of pouchitis in
patients with and without PSC who
underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
for ulcerative colitis was determined. A
total of 1097 patients who had an ileal
pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative
colitis, 54 with associated PSC, were
studied. Pouchitis was defined by clinical
criteria in all patients and by clinical,
endoscopic, and histological criteria in
83% of PSC patients and 85% of their
matched controls. PSC was defined by
clinical, radiological, and pathological
findings. One or more episodes of
pouchitis occurred in 32% of patients
without PSC and 63% of patients with
PSC. The cumulative risk of pouchitis at
one, two, five, and 10 years after ileal
pouch-anal anastomosis was 15.5%0
22/5%, 36%/ and 45.5% for the patients
without PSC and 22%/ 43%, 61%, and 79%
for the patients with PSC. In the PSC
group, the risk of pouchitis was not
related to the severity of liver disease. In
conclusion, the strong correlation
between PSC and pouchitis suggest a
common link in their pathogenesis.

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal reser￾voir is now a widely accepted procedure in the
surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).
The operation cures the gastrointestinal symp￾toms and eliminates the potential for malig￾nant degeneration while preserving anorectal
functions.
Non-specific inflammation of the reservoir
or pouchitis is the principal longterm compli￾cation of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA).
The clinical problem, dominated by diarrhoea,
sometimes containing blood, and abdominal
discomfort, varies between 7 and 47% of
patientsl4 depending on the duration of
follow up. Pouchitis usually occurs in patients
operated on for UC5 and has been associated
with the presence of extraintestinal manifesta￾tions of the disease.6 In particular, the presence
of concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), a chronic cholestatic syndrome of
unknown cause characterised by fibrosing
obliteration of the bile ducts, seems to be a
significant risk factor for the development of
pouchitis.7
To further explore the association between
PSC and pouchitis, the aims of this study were:
(a) to determine if PSC represents an indepen￾dent risk factor for pouchitis; (b) to compare
clinical, endoscopic, and pathological findings
of pouchitis in a subset of patients without
PSC; and (c) to search for correlations
between the risk of pouchitis and status of
liver disease.
Methods
Patients
Between January 1981 and April 1993, 1097
patients underwent ileal J pouch-anal anasto￾mosis for UC at the Mayo Medical Center in
Rochester, Minnesota. All pouches were con￾structed according to a technique previously
described,8 and patients with indeterminate
colitis or with other designs of reservoir were
excluded. The following information was
retrieved from the medical records of all
patients: duration of UC calculated from the
date of onset of colonic symptoms to the date
of IPAA; extent of UC (rectal, sigmoid, left
sided, and pancolonic) and indication for
IPAA.
Fifty four of these patients were identified as
having associated PSC. The diagnosis of PSC
was based on established clinical or bio￾chemical evidence of cholestasis of more than
six months' duration and characteristic cholan￾giographic9 or typical hepatic histological find￾ings, or both.10 For those patients with PSC,
the following information was retrieved from
the medical record: (1) Duration of PSC
determined by the date of earliest suggested
evidence of liver disease. (2) Specific symp￾toms and signs of liver disease, such as jaun￾dice, fever, cholangitis, encephalopathy,
variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatomegaly,
splenomegaly, and oesophageal varices. (3)
Biochemical testing, including serum alkaline
phosphatase, total bilirubin, aspartate amino￾transferase, prothrombin time, and serum
protein electrophoresis. (4) Cholangiographic
appearance of the biliary tree was classified as
normal, extrahepatic changes, or intra and
extrahepatic changes.' Small duct PSC was

Pouchitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis
defined as histological evidence of PSC
(pericholangitis) with a normal cholangiogram
in a patient with a history of UC. 12 Histological
changes were classified according to the
criteria of Ludwig et al 13: cholangitis or portal
hepatitis (stage I), periportal fibrosis or peri￾portal hepatitis (stage II), septal fibrosis or
bridging necrosis, or both (stage III), and
biliary cirrhosis (stage IV). Likelihood of
patient survival (with regard to PSC) was
based on serum bilirubin concentration, histo￾logical stage on liver biopsy, age, and the
presence of splenomegaly14 was also deter￾mined for each patient.
Definition ofpouchitis and classification of
clinical course
The diagnosis of pouchitis was based on
clinical criteria including watery diarrhoea,
haematochezia, urgency, abdominal or pelvic
discomfort, malaise, and fever. The occurrence
of pouchitis in patients with or without PSC
was determined by the date of the first episode
after IPAA retrieved from a computerised
registry. This registry was also used to deter￾mine the length of time between IPAA and the
first episode of pouchitis, the symptoms of
pouchitis, and the number of episodes of
pouchitis (less than or equal to two, more than
two, or chronic pouchitis).
A more detailed comparison of the clinical,
endoscopic, and histological features of all the
patients with pouchitis and PSC (n=34) were
compared with a group of patients with
pouchitis but without PSC (n=33) retrieved
from the computerised registry and matched
for age, sex, extraintestinal manifestations
other than PSC, date of IPAA, and length of
follow up after closure of the temporary
ileostomy. This more detailed evaluation was
performed to assess whether the severity of
pouchitis was similar in patients with and
without PSC. Clinical evaluation included the
length of time between IPAA and the first
episode of pouchitis, the symptoms of
pouchitis, and the number of episodes of
pouchitis as defined above. The following
endoscopic findings of inflammation were
recorded as present or absent: oedema; granu￾larity; friability; erythema; loss of the vascular
pattern; mucus exudate; and mucosal ulcera￾tion. 15 16 The severity of endoscopic inflamma￾tion was then classified according to the
following definition: mild (discrete oedema of
the mucosa); moderate (erythema, muco￾purulent exudate, and small ulcerations); or
severe (deep ulcerations, diffuse erythema, and
extensive mucosa necrosis). Histopathological
changes were classified according to the
criteria of Shepherd et al.'6 17 The pouchitis
disease activity index as described by
Sandborn18 was also used to quantitate pouch￾itis disease severity.
Bowel function was obtained from the
registry annually updated by a clinical nurse
coordinator using telephone contact or ques￾tionnaire mailings, or both. Incontinence was
described as none, occasional (no interruption
of daily activities), or frequent (more than one
episode per week with interruption of activi￾ties). The use of drugs was defined by the need
for more than four days per week of anti￾diarrhoeal agents or antibiotics to control the
frequency of defecation.
Statistical methods
The association of pouchitis with nominal risk
factors was assessed with x2 tests, the associa￾tion with ordinal risk factors was assessed with
rank sum tests, and the association with con￾tinuous variables was assessed with t tests or,
when necessary, rank sum tests. The occur￾rence of pouchitis was estimated as a function
of time since surgery using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Log rank tests were used to compare
the curves with nominal risk factors.
Results
Cumulative risk ofpouchitis after IPAA in UC
with or without PSC
Overall, pouchitis occurred at least once in 370
patients (35.7%) after IPAA. Among the 1043
patients without PSC, pouchitis occurred in
336 patients (32%) and in 34 of 54 patients
with associated PSC (63%) (p<0 001, x2).
The estimated risk of pouchitis at one, two,
five, and 10 years after IPAA was 1 5.5%,
22.5%, 36%, and 45.5%, respectively, in
patients without PSC; and 22%, 43%, 61%,
and 79% in patients with PSC, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the occurrence of pouchitis
estimated as a function of time. The risk
was significantly greater in PSC patients
(p<0.0001, log rank).
Pouchitis disease course after IPAA for UC with
and without PSC
Chronic pouchitis was more frequent in the
group of patients with PSC (60% v 15%,
p<0001), and acute pouchitis in those
patients with less than or equal to two
episodes, occurred more often in patients
without PSC (36% v 6%, p<0.001) (Fig 2).
Clinical, endoscopic, and histological pre￾sentation of pouchitis in 34 patients with PSC
(group 1) were compared with a group of 33
matched UC patients without PSC (group 2).
As Table I shows, both groups were com￾parable with regard to demographic character￾istics.
The mean interval between ileostomy
closure and the occurrence of the first episode
of pouchitis was 12 months (range one to 96
months) in group 1 and 13 months (range two
to 60 months) in group 2 (p=0.8). Diarrhoea
was the most common symptom and was
present in 94 and 97% of each group respec￾tively. Abdominal cramping (79% v 44%,
p=0004) and bloody stools (39% v 17%,
p=0.048) were more frequent in group 1.
Endoscopic examination of the reservoir
during or immediately after an episode of
pouchitis was performed in 28 patients (83%)
in group 1 and 28 patients (85%) in group 2.
Pouch endoscopy showed similar patterns

of 20 patients did not (group B, mean follow up

as- 11:9 in group B, p=0-8), age at the diagnosis
of of UC (20.5 (6) years v 25 (10) years, p=0.8),

(12 39 (10) years (range 17 to 52) in patients with￾2) out pouchitis (p =000 1).
ion As Table II shows, the occurrence of PSC in
ical pouchitis patients did not influence stool
or frequency or continence. The use of anti￾ical diarrhoeal drugs was no greater in patients who

ase not.
or A similar number of patients in each group

However, splenomegaly (24% v 10%) and
oesophageal varices (20% v 10%) were more
frequent in patients with pouchitis.
Table III shows that mean values of bio￾chemical tests were similar in both groups.
Cholangiograms were performed in 46 of
the patients diagnosed with PSC. Of these, 10

follow up, six patients with PSC had died,
three each with and without pouchitis, a mean
of 54 months after the IPAA and 64 months
after the diagnosis of PSC. The estimated sur￾vival five years after the diagnosis of PSC was
80%. Cause of death included cholangiocarci￾noma in two patients, liver cirrhosis in one
patient, and metastatic colon cancer in one
patient. Eight patients underwent orthotopic
liver transplantation for end stage liver disease
and have been described in detail elsewhere.19
Discussion
Our findings show that patients with both UC
and PSC have an increased risk of pouchitis
after IPAA. Clinical symptoms of inflamma￾tion of the pouch occurred in 64% of 54
patients with PSC and in 32% of 1043 patients
without PSC. Moreover, chronic pouchitis
defined by the need for drugs (antibiotics/anti￾inflammatory drugs) more than 15 days per
month to control symptoms was significantly
more frequent in the group of patients with
PSC. Endoscopic and histological presentation
of pouchitis were similar in both groups of
patients. We did not find any significant corre￾lation between the severity of the liver disease
and the risk of pouchitis in the group of
patients with PSC; however, pouchitis was
more frequent in patients with diffuse changes
on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan￾creatography (ERCP) (large duct PSC) and in
patients with stage III and IV disease on liver
biopsies.
IPAA is a widely accepted procedure for the
surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis as 94%

of patients have a successful outcome over the
long term.2 As experience with this technique
has grown, however, it has become evident
that acute pouch inflammation or pouchitis is
becoming an important longterm complica￾tion. Even with rapid response to treatment,
13% of all IPAA patients regard pouchitis to be
a significant chronic problem with social and
professional inconvenience.6
The highly variable frequency of pouchitis
in published series may be explained by the
variety of diagnostic criteria used to define this
syndrome and the extent of follow up. In the
past, the diagnosis of pouchitis was based
solely upon the clinical presentation.2 5 6 Some
authors have advocated the use of endo￾scopic15 or histological criteria16 17 to confirm a
clinical diagnosis of pouchitis. In general, we
agree with this approach.1820 This viewpoint
has not been widely adopted until recently,
however, and many of our patients who have
been given a clinical diagnosis of pouchitis
have not undergone endoscopy with biopsy. In
this study, we used clinical criteria to diagnose
pouchitis in all 1097 patients. There is some
concern that the failure to confirm a clinical
diagnosis of pouchitis with endoscopy and
histology may lead to an overestimation of the
frequency of pouchitis by including patients
with irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's
disease, and anastomotic stricture.18 This
criticism may apply to our patients with a
clinical diagnosis of pouchitis who do not
have PSC, many of whom did not have a con￾firmatory endoscopy with biopsies. Most
(83%) of our patients with PSC and pouchitis,
however, had the clinical diagnosis confirmed
endoscopically and histologically, making an
overestimation of pouchitis in this group
unlikely. If the frequency of pouchitis is over￾estimated in patients without PSC but not in
patients with PSC, the net effect would be to
decrease the difference in the frequency of
pouchitis between the two groups. Thus, the
highly significant difference in the frequency of
pouchitis between patients with and without
PSC in our study may represent a minimal
estimate. Based on these data, we believe that
the association between PSC and pouchitis is
real.
In patients with pouchitis and PSC, and
matched controls with pouchitis but without
PSC, we found that the use of histological
criterion'6 17 alone to diagnose pouchitis was
inaccurate in nearly 50% of patients. This may
be explained by a lack of sensitivity and speci￾ficity for histological examination.18 Pouch
inflammation is often patchy and random
biopsy specimens may show a great variation of
the severity of inflammation within the pouch.
Chronic inflammatory changes in the pouch
are almost universal,'4 and some degree of
acute inflammation is present in 38% to 64%
of pouches.16 21 On the other hand, some
inflamed pouches with clinical symptoms and
endoscopic changes of acute inflammation
may fail to show a histological score of inflam￾mation greater than 8 and therefore may not be
classified as pouchitis based on histological
criteria alone. The PDAI18 may be a better

indicator of pouchitis. Although this index has
not yet been validated, it does seem to be
useful in distinguishing patients with and with￾out pouchitis.22-25 After a clinical diagnosis of
pouchitis has been confirmed with endoscopy
and histology, clinical criteria alone may be
sufficient for patient treatment as a correlation
between the two modes of diagnosis was found
in more than 90/o of patients in this study.
The aetiology of pouchitis remains unclear;
proposed mechanisms include faecal stasis,
perturbation of bacterial flora in the pouch,
nutritional deficiencies, ischaemia, and recur￾rence of UC within the pouch.20 Identifying
clinical risk factors for pouchitis may help
elucidate the aetiology of this disorder. Clinical
findings favouring the recurrent UC theory
include: the low frequency of pouchitis in
patients with familial polyposis and an IPAA5;
the association of pouchitis with the extrain￾testinal manifestations of UC6; and the associ￾ation of perinuclear anticytoplasmic antibodies
(pANCA) with UC, PSC, and chronic
pouchitis.25-27 This study strengthens the
recurrent UC theory by showing a strong asso￾ciation between pouchitis and a specific
extraintestinal manifestation of UC, PSC. We
did not determine the pANCA status of the
1097 patients in this study; however, further
study of the inter-relation of pANCA and pou￾chitis in UC patients with and without PSC
certainly seems warranted in further studies.
Likewise, studies to determine the HLA geno￾types of these patient subgroups should be
undertaken.
A changed faecal bile acid pool in patients
with PSC could also potentially contribute to
the development of pouchitis. In UC patients
with an IPAA, there seems to be no difference
in the total concentration or total daily output
of faecal bile acids between those with and
without pouchitis.25 28 29 There is some dis￾agreement, however, as to whether bile acid
conjugation and dehydroxylation is increased,
unchanged or decreased compared with
patients without pouchitis.25 28 29 To date,
there are no published reports that bile acids
are different in patients with PSC. We did not
specifically inquire about the use of ursodeoxy￾cholic acid as a treatment for PSC or the use of
cholestyramine as a treatment for pruritus
associated with PSC, although it is probable
that some of the patients with PSC were taking
these drugs. We have previously shown that
ursodeoxycholic acid does not improve the
disease course of UC in patients with PSC,30
and we believed it unlikely to affect the disease
course of pouchitis. There was not a correla￾tion between the histological stage of liver
disease (stage III or IV) and the development
of pouchitis. Thus, treatment with cholestyra￾mine would be unlikely to affect the develop￾ment or course of pouchitis. The absence of
correlation between the risk score of PSC or
the histological stage of PSC and the risk of
pouchitis lead us to think that the occurrence
of pouchitis in PSC patients is dependent
upon factors other than the severity of hepato￾biliary involvement. Of interest, the risk of
pouchitis was greater in patients with diffuse
involvement of the biliary tree (66%) than in
patients with small duct PSC (30%).
Despite the risk of pouchitis and an
increased risk of postoperative complications,
IPAA is still our preferred surgical treatment
for patients presenting with UC and PSC.
After proctocolectomy and Brooke ileostomy,
peristomal varices develop in more than 50%
of patients within four years and are often
associated with troublesome bleeding.3' IPAA
can be performed safely in patients with PSC
and, thus far, there is no risk of ileoanal
anastomotic varices and bleeding.7 The high
incidence of chronic pouchitis clearly empha￾sises the need for better treatments; however,
this major cause of concern after IPAA seldom
requires pouch exclusion or excision.
