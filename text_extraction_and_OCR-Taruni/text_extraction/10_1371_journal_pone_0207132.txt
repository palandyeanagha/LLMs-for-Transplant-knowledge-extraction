Abstract
Background and aims
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths.
Patients with advanced HCC are treated with sorafenib. A recent randomized controlled trial
demonstrated a survival benefit for regorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC
who had progressed on sorafenib. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this
approach.
Methods
To evaluate the cost effectiveness of regorafenib, we used a Markov model that incorpo￾rates health outcomes, measured by life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
Drug costs were based on 2017 discounted prices. Model robustness was validated by
probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations.
Results
The use of regorafenib results in a gain of 19.76 weeks of life (0.38 Life Years) as compared
to placebo. When adjusted for quality of life, using regorafenib produced a gain of 0.25 qual￾ity adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib
compared with best supportive care was between $201,797 and $268,506 per QALY.
Conclusion
The modest incremental benefit at a relatively high incremental cost of regorafenib treat￾ment suggests that it is not cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness to pay
thresholds.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third cause of can￾cer-related deaths worldwide[1]. Major risk factors for the development of HCC are cirrhosis
derived from any etiology and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus[2].
Patients whose disease is diagnosed at an early stage have a good prognosis, since loco-regional
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or liver resection for limited disease or alternatively, transplan￾tation for those with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, are all potentially curative. However,
therapeutic options for patients with an advanced and/or metastatic disease are much more
limited and accordingly prognosis is grave [3].
Until recently, the only FDA approved first line drug for patients with advanced HCC
(stage C according to BCLC classification) is the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib[4]. Unfortu￾nately, large trials have shown only a minimal benefit with sorafenib, translated to a median
survival and time to progression benefit of less than three months, at the cost of potentially
serious side effects[5, 6]. Therefore, until more effective and safe therapies for patients with
advanced HCC are made available, one should cautiously consider the benefit of this treatment
on an individual basis, especially in patients with more advanced liver disease[7].
Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with a more potent activity compared to sorafenib
[8], currently approved for the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer who
failed previous therapies [9]. Recently, a phase 3 clinical trial (RESORCE trial, ClinicalTrials.
gov, number NCT01774344) demonstrated that patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh
A cirrhosis whose disease has progressed on sorafenib treatment could benefit from treatment
with regorafenib [10]. The median survival benefit for regorafenib treated patients in this
study was 2.8 months as compared to placebo treated patients. Notably, treatment was accom￾panied by adverse events of hypertension, hand-foot skin reaction and diarrhea in a large pro￾portion of patients.
Regorafenib is given in 4-week cycles in which the drug is given for 3 weeks with one week
off. However, regorafenib comes at a high financial cost. Recently, we showed that treating
patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed a previous treatment, with regorafenib,
results in a minimal incremental benefit at high incremental costs [11]. Given the marginal
benefit of regorafenib in HCC patients shown in the RESORCE study, the incremental benefit
of regorafenib relative to its potential costs in these patients should be further explored.
A recent study by Parikh et al[12] showed, based on the RESORCE trial, that sorafenib
treatment as a second line is not cost-effective. However, this study assumed a constant disease
progression over-time, an assumption that does not necessarily reflects the real-life situation.
Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib as a
second line therapy for patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who had pro￾gressed on sorafenib. In our analyses, we assumed that the transition probabilities between dis￾ease states depend on time.
Materials and methods
The data from the RESORCE randomized controlled trial were obtained from a published
manuscript[10]. The data is anonymous and therefore no informed consent was obtained.
We constructed a Markov model with an initial decision regarding treatment with regorafe￾nib plus supportive care or best supportive care only. As shown in Fig 1 and described in detail
previously[11], patients who initially received regorafenib could stop treatment because of
either disease progression or intolerance (grades 3–4 adverse events). Patients who experi￾enced progression after regorafenib could receive best supportive care. Progression to death
could occur from each health state.

A model cycle represents daily regorafenib treatment for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week
break (overall a 4-week cycle). The primary outputs of the model are as follows: life-years
(LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), which were used to calculate the incremental cost￾effectiveness ratio (ICER). The Markov model was implemented in TreeAge Pro 2018 software
and statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB.
Model survival estimates
Our assumptions were based on the survival benefits associated with regorafenib treatment in
patients who had previously progressed on treatment with sorafenib, according to the
RESORCE trial[10]. The overall mortality rate, which corresponded to the probability of
death, was derived from the Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) curves for treatment with
regorafenib and placebo published in the RESORCE trial. MATLAB software was used to
extract the data points from the OS curves, and these data points were then used to fit paramet￾ric survival models as previously described[11]. We found that Weibull models provided a
good fit for all curves (S1 Fig). On the basis of the fitted Weibull OS model, denoted as S(t), we
computed the cause-specific mortality M at cycle t as: M ¼ 1  Sðtþ1Þ
SðtÞ
Based on Technical Support Document (TSD) 14 by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit (DSU), the six most common families of
parametric models were assessed for best fit to the trial data as recommended by NICE[13].
These were: (1) the exponential, (2) Weibull, (3) Gompertz, (4) log-normal, (5) log-logistic
Fig 1. A scheme illustrating the Markov model used in this study (AE, adverse events).

and (6) generalized gamma models. The goodness of fit of the parametric models were tested
visually and by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Informa￾tion Criterion (BIC), indexes which measure the adequacy of fit to the data. The Weibull distri￾bution was the best parametric estimation of the Kaplan Meir curves.
Progression risk
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs or progression on therapy in the regorafenib treatment
group were estimated assuming an exponential distribution based on the median treatment
duration published in the RESORCE trial. Estimates of mortality and progression risk beyond
the follow-up time in the clinical trials were extrapolated based on the fitted survival models,
as previously described[11].
Utility estimates
Each health state was assigned a health utility score based on quality-of- life data collected in
the RESORCE trial. We used a utility of 0.76 in the progression-free state and 0.68 in the case
of progression. To compute the total QALYs in the Markov model, survival time was adjusted
by the utility. We included grade 3 to 4 AEs in the model that had significantly different rates
between the arms of the RESORCE trial, which were hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, diar￾rhea, and fatigue. Disutilities associated with AEs were estimated based on established values
in the literature[14]. For the temporary health states associated with AEs modeled in this study
(fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and hypertension), the measured decreases in utilities
from the published literature and the unmeasured decreases in utilities for these same health
states in the RESORCE study were expected to be similar. The duration of AEs was estimated
based on clinical experience. 14 days for hand-foot syndrome with a disutility of -0.116[14].
Five days for hypertension with a disutility of zero[14]. Five days for diarrhea with a disutility
of -0.103[14]. Fatigue was assumed to last for 10 days, with a disutility of -0.115[14]. The dura￾tion-adjusted disutility was subtracted from the baseline utility to calculate the overall utility of
each health state.
Cost estimates
Only direct medical costs were considered and stated in 2017 US dollars. To estimate the unit
price of regorafenib, we used 2017 prices from GoodRX (https://www.goodrx.com/
regorafenib?drug-name=Regorafenib). Good RX is an online source for American drug prices
that incorporates discounts. Regorafenib is dosed in 40-mg tablets, and the recommended
starting dose is 160 mg. The price is $180.79 per 40-mg tablet. The RESORCE trial states that
the mean daily dose received was 144 mg. We performed analyses in the model with three dif￾ferent dosing strategies: 120, 160, and 144 mg daily, with the later dosing not being realistic in
clinical practice but providing an average value.
Assumptions for management of AEs were based on recently published guidelines and as
previously described[11]. Clobetasol cream 0.05% and 4% lidocaine cream for the treatment of
hand-foot syndrome. Amlodipine 5 mg daily for the treatment of hypertension. Lomotil and
loperamide for the treatment of diarrhea. We assumed no specific medical management for
fatigue. AE costs were calculated according to the Medicare physician fee schedule for 2017.
Outpatient physician visits fees were based on current procedural terminology codes. The
methods used for these cost calculations were previously described by Tumeh et al.[15]. We
performed annual discounting of the costs and benefit in this analysis, at a rate of 3%.

Sensitivity analysis
Internal model validations were performed, demonstrating a close approximation between the
OS curves generated by the Markov model simulation and those presented in the RESORCE
trial. To evaluate the robustness of the model and address uncertainty in the estimation of
model parameters, a series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Utilities and drug costs were
varied within ± 20% of their baseline values, in accordance with established approaches. The
range for the cost of regorafenib was only -20%, as we did not expect the price to be higher
than published. In univariable sensitivity analyses, we varied the value of one parameter at a
time over its defined range and examined the effect on the ICER. We used the lower boundary
for 120-mg dosing ($7,422 for one cycle of therapy) and the upper boundary for 160-mg dos￾ing ($14,843 for one cycle of therapy) to provide the range of costs of regorafenib. In probabi￾listic sensitivity analyses, we performed 1,000 Monte Carlo trials each with 1,000 participants
simulations, each time randomly sampling from the distributions for all parameters simulta￾neously. The baseline values, ranges, and distributions of model parameters are listed in
Table 1.
Results
Base case results
Table 2 outlines the base case model results. The use of regorafenib and BSC compared with
placebo and BSC resulted in a gain of 19.76 weeks of life (0.38 LYs). When adjusted for quality
of life, using regorafenib produced a gain of 0.25 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Accord￾ingly, the incremental monthly cost of a course of treatment with regorafenib was between
$11,410 (120-mg dosing) to $15,186 (160-mg dosing). The ICER for regorafenib compared
with best supportive care was between $201,797 and $268,506 per QALY.
Sensitivity analyses
The results of univariable sensitivity analyses are presented in Fig 2. Across broad variation in
the ranges for each parameter, the ICER remained > $150,000 per QALY. The duration, cost,
and disutility for AEs had only a minor influence on the ICER.
The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses are shown in the Monte-Carlo simulation
plot (Fig 3) and in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (Fig 4). This curve shows the prob￾ability that regorafenib is cost-effective across increasing willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds.
These results demonstrated 0% likelihood that regorafenib is cost-effective at WTP thresholds
<$150,000 per QALY.
Discussion
HCC is the fifth most common malignancy in men and the seventh in women and is the third
leading cause of cancer death worldwide[1]. Major efforts are focused on prevention strategies
in high-risk populations, including vaccination for HBV[16], anti-viral therapies for both
HBV and HCV infections[17, 18] and screening programs for cirrhotic patients[19]. However,
only limited progress has been made in recent years in finding more effective therapeutic
approaches for patients who are already afflicted with this deadly disease[20]. One of the rea￾sons for the slow progress in the field is the molecular heterogeneity of HCC, largely derived
from the variety of etiologies leading to liver oncogenesis[21]. Furthermore, a large heteroge￾neity can be frequently found even in the same tumor[22], further complicating the search for
a systemic drug that may target the “Achilles heel” of the tumor and thereby lead to cure.

by great enthusiasm. However, results from large trials performed in different geographical
areas around the globe, in which Child-Pugh A cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC were
treated with sorafenib, provided only modest incremental benefit at a cost of potentially debili￾tating adverse events[5, 6].
Several studies have analyzed the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib among patients with
advanced HCC, and their conclusions largely depend on the source of data they relied on. For
example, a Canadian study that analyzed the results of the SHARP trial, has shown that sorafe￾nib treatment is cost-effective as compared to best supportive care (BSC) in patients with
advanced HCC. An Italian cost-effectiveness study, on the other hand, which was based on the
SOFIA trial, has found that dose-adjusted, but not full-dose sorafenib treatment is cost-effec￾tive in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC compared to BSC[23]. Another study,
based on the SEER-Medicare database, has found that among elderly patients with advanced
HCC, sorafenib treatment results in improved survival but the same treatment is not cost￾effective in patients with hepatic decompensation[24].
Until recently, patients who have progressed on sorafenib treatment had no real option for
salvage therapy. The results of the RESORCE trial show that treatment with regorafenib
resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with placebo in
patients whose disease has progressed on sorafenib. Statistically significant improvement over

placebo was also shown for the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival, time to pro￾gression, disease control and overall tumor response[10]. Our study investigates the cost-effec￾tiveness of regorafenib in this group of patients, showing an incremental gain of 0.25 QALYs
with an ICER for regorafenib compared with best supportive care of between $201,797 and
$268,506 per QALY. Although the $50,000-per-QALY threshold for drug cost-effectiveness
has been questioned recently and was suggested to be too low[25], the WTP for oncologic
drugs in the US is estimated to range between $50,000-$150,000[26], well below the cost per
QALY for regorafenib according to our study.
These results call into question the value of this costly treatment not only from a public
point of view but also on an individual basis. The results suggest that clinicians should carefully
consider the risks and benefits before treating this specific population of patients with a costly
drug associated with significant adverse physical and financial impact.
Our study’s conclusion is in line with a recent study done by Parikh et al.[12], examining
the cost effectiveness of regorafenib as a second line therapy for HCC. Using a Markov stimu￾lation model, the authors have concluded that at the current price, regorafenib is not cost
effective.
However, in this study the authors have assumed a constant progression rate of the disease
over time, an assumption that does not necessarily reflect the real-life situation. Our study
reflects the progression rate of the disease as observed in the RESORCE trial and therefore
may be more accurate.

While there were some differences between our model design and the model design by Par￾ikh et al, the overall findings were similar. Parikh at al found an ICER of $224,362 per QALY,
while we found an ICER of $268,506. Both of these ICERs are substantially above commonly
accepted thresholds, and provide confirmation that the ICER of regorafenib is very high. Our
study provides additional support for health care payers to call for price reduction of
regorafenib.
Our study has several limitations. First, for the cost-effectiveness calculations we used the
estimated price of the drug in the USA and thus the applicability of our findings to other parts
of the world is not straight-forward. Second, the estimated price we used may be inaccurate
due to additional discounts that we are unaware of. Third, our calculations are based on results
of a randomized controlled trial with a highly-selected study population that do not necessarily
reflect the real-world data[27], as was demonstrated in the case of sorafenib treatment[28].
Therefore, in the future, real-world data could potentially reveal a much inferior cost-benefit
estimation compared to our findings in this study.
In our study, we assumed that transition probabilities depend on time. Although transitions
also depend on individual characteristics, we were limited by the available data from the
RESORCE trial. For this reason, we conducted a sensitivity analysis over a large range of HR
values (or equivalent parameters of the Weibull distributions) and a Monte Carlo simulation
where the transition probabilities for each subject are different.
In summary, our study reveals modest incremental benefit at a relatively high incremental
cost of regorafenib treatment in HCC patients who had progressed on sorafenib treatment.

These findings suggest that a highly selective approach in choosing patients for this treatment
is warranted.
