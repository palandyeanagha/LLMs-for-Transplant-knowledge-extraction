Walled-off necrosis is considered one of the most severe complications after an episode of severe acute pancreatitis. Traditionally, 
percutaneous drainage is selected as the first treatment step, while open surgery can be planned as a secondary option if necrosectomy 
is required. In recent years, endoscopic necrosectomy has evolved as a more favorable approach. To date, a step-up treatment strategy 
is recommended, particularly when a plastic stent is selected as the drainage device. Multi-gateway endoscopic therapy may be used 
in a step-up fashion if only one stent fails to clear debris. Over many years, there has been an evolution in stent selection, from plastic 
to metallic stents. Within a few years of its clinical usage, lumen-apposing stents are gaining more popularity as they offer direct 
endoscopic necrosectomy and only require a few sessions. Clin Endosc 2020;53:49-53

Introduction
Walled-off necrosis (WON) is considered one of the most 
severe complications after an episode of severe acute pancre￾atitis. Although many patients who suffer from WON can be 
treated conservatively, a quarter of them may require inter￾ventional drainage or debridement.1
 Traditionally, percutane￾ous drainage is selected as the first treatment step, while open 
surgery can be planned as a secondary option, if necrosecto￾my is required. Due to the aggressiveness of open surgery and 
risk of pancreatico-cutaneous fistula from the percutaneous 
approach (unless internal drainage or pancreatic duct bridg￾ing by an internal stent is provided),2
 these two techniques are 
not recommended as the first line in current practice.3
 Over 
the last decade, new minimally invasive techniques, including 
video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) and en￾doscopic necrosectomy (EN), have emerged as more favorable 
approaches. In this review, we will mainly address EN and the 
selection of patients with WON for this procedure based on 
the appropriate timing and indications. Additionally, we will 
elaborate on the different EN techniques and the potential use 
of new devices, particularly, lumen-apposing metallic stents 
(LAMSs).
Timing, indications, strategy for 
intervention, and its limitations
The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis can be divided 
into acute interstitial or acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Ac￾cording to the revised Atlanta classification,4
 at the age of less 
than 4 weeks, acute peripancreatic collection develops from 
acute interstitial pancreatitis whereas acute necrotic collection 
develops from acute necrotizing pancreatitis. While pseudo￾cysts evolve from acute necrotic collection, WON is defined 
as the 4-week evolution of acute necrotic collection.

Currently, there are two strategies for WON intervention: 
direct EN, by performing debridement in the first few ses￾sions regardless of the clinical course of WON; and a step-up 
approach, in which EN is performed after a failed response 
to transmural drainage with only stent insertion. More im￾portantly, draining WON after 4–6 weeks, with expected wall 
maturity after an episode of acute pancreatitis, has been well 
practiced. Although this timing is arbitrarily recommended, 
the practice has been adopted based on surgical experience 
for over 35 years.5
Many series6-8 have demonstrated the advantage of a step￾up strategy to avoid unnecessary EN by showing that about 
20%–90% of patients with WON can be treated by endoscopic 
drainage alone, with either a plastic stent (PS) or fully covered 
metallic stent, including a LAMS. Many endoscopists may 
elect to utilize a step-up strategy because they would like the 
transmural tract to mature a few days after the transmural 
stent is deployed. Certain factors that might preclude the 
success of the drainage-only strategy include the large size of 
WON, the small diameter of the stent, and the higher propor￾tion of solid debris in the cavity.6-8 Thus, a patient with large 
WON or WON with a high proportion of solid debris may be 
a good candidate for direct EN, and the preferred stent may 
be a larger-diameter stent such as a LAMS (Fig. 1).
Although endoscopic guidance by examining the bulging 
area in the stomach or duodenum with a standard endoscope 
is possible, endosonographic guidance by an echoendoscope 
has been widely practiced because it can help to avoid inter￾posed blood vessels. Moreover, echoendoscope guidance is 
capable of targeting non-bulging WON in patients who failed 
endoscopic visualization.9
However, echoendoscope guidance may not be able to ac￾cess the area beyond the vicinity of an echoendoscope, such as 
paracolic gutters or WON located at the peripheral sections of 
the abdomen. Therefore, VARD may be preferred, particular￾ly when WON is located near the left side of the colon and/or 
under the spleen.10,11
Although a landmark trial from the Netherlands demon￾strated that EN can reduce the proinflammatory response as 
well as the composite clinical endpoint when compared with 
surgical necrosectomy, there were some patients requiring 
VARD as salvage treatment after failed treatment by EN. 
Interestingly, their WON was located at the periphery of the 
abdomen and was approached from the left side.11
Multi-gateway endoscopic 
necrosectomy and the role of 
lumen-apposing metallic stent
The concept of the multiple transluminal gateway technique 
(MTGT) was first described by Varadarajulu et al. in 2011
to facilitate better drainage of necrotic material and infected 
fluid from WON.12 They recommended the use of echoen￾doscope-guided puncture for at least two to three tracts, with 
one tract serving as an irrigation site via a nasocystic catheter. 
The others work as conduits to drain the contents by having 
double pigtail stents placed to keep the stomas open. With a 
back and forth mechanism of fluid drainage in the WON cav￾ity, necrotic material and fluid can be rapidly drained. They 
reported on 60 patients with WON, 12 patients who under￾went the MTGT and 48 patients who had a single PS placed 
(conventional group). They found that the MTGT provided 
successful drainage without additional EN in 11/12 patients 
(91.7%), whereas the conventional group only achieved suc￾cessful drainage in 25/48 patients (52%). Of those 23 patients 
in the control group who were not successful managed with 
conventional treatment, 17 patients underwent debridement 
surgery, 3 patients underwent step-up EN, and 3 patients died 
because of multiple-organ failure.12
In recent years, LAMSs have become the more preferred 
stent in patients with WON. The advantages of a LAMS over 
a PS include the larger stent diameter that facilitates the spon￾taneous dislodgement of large debris and allows end-viewing 
scope entry for EN.13-15 In addition, after LAMS placement, 
an immediate EN can be performed without waiting for tract

maturity.15 Although, the use of a LAMS is promising, a recent 
meta-analysis showed no difference in the pooled rates of 
clinical success and adverse events between WON drained by 
a LAMS and that drained by a PS (88.5% [95% confidence in￾terval, 82.5–92.6; I2
=71.7] vs. 88.1% [95% confidence interval, 
80.5–93.0; I2
=78.1], p=0.93; and 11.2% [6.8–17.9; I2
=82.0] vs. 
15.9% [8.4–27.8; I2
=78.8], p=0.38, respectively).14 Notably, there 
was significant heterogeneity in the recruited population, and 
the severity of adverse events developed from a LAMS versus 
a PS could not be classified and compared directly.
We have recently adopted two concepts and combined 
them together (MTGT with multiple LAMSs) as we believe 
that they work through different mechanisms. We had put 
two LAMSs in a few patients with large WON (>10 cm) and 
experienced a very rapid clearance of necrotic tissue within 
only a few sessions of direct EN (Fig. 2). 
The endpoint for endoscopic 
necrosectomy
The requirement for transmural stents ends after certain 
objectives have been accomplished, such as the absence or 
control of ongoing infections, at which point antibiotics can 
be discontinued. The last step of EN is to remove the stent 
and close-down the stoma. However, this can be done after 
confirmation via a pancreatogram to demonstrate no pancre￾atic duct disruption. The risk of recurrent fluid collection is 
significant in patients who have pancreatic duct disruption, 
particularly in those with disconnected duct syndrome.16 A

(C) Endoscopic debridement via the second lumen-ap￾posing metallic stent (LAMS) that was placed transgastrically. Notably, the first LAMS (blue arrow) could be seen from a far distance. (D) Plain radiography of the 
abdomen demonstrated two LAMS (red arrows) in place at the WON site. (E) The final CT scan of the upper abdomen showed a resolution of the WON with a trans￾mural plastic stent in place.

group from South Korea demonstrated that after the removal 
of the drainage catheter with either external or internal stents, 
patients with main pancreatic duct disruptions had more re￾currences of fluid collection than those without duct disrup￾tion (71% vs. 17%) and that they were more likely to require 
surgery (43% vs. 6%).16 Therefore, the status of the pancreatic 
duct needs to be confirmed before the removal of a transmu￾ral stent.
Clinical evidence before completing EN are arbitrary con￾cepts. Some experts recommended using computed tomogra￾phy (CT) scans of the abdomen to demonstrate almost com￾plete resolution of fluid collection in conjunction with clinical 
response,17 while others suggested more than 40% of necrotic 
tissue disappearance in 1 month as an endpoint.18 The Mayo 
Clinic team has proposed the endpoint of EN as the demon￾stration of granulation pink tissue in almost all walls of the 
cavity, which is usually achieved after complete debridement, 
and confirmation via CT scan of significant cavity reduction.19
Our group accepted the idea of seeing pink granulation tissue 
on the cavity wall in combination with clinical response, as 
this is the best way to demonstrate almost complete removal 
of the necrotic tissue.3 
Adverse events 
Regarding adverse events related to endoscopic treatment, 
complications were usually stent-related adverse events such 
as stent occlusion and stent-induced bleeding and migration, 
which are the most common. Wang et al. reported on the ad￾verse events in three different types of stents: PSs, LAMSs, and 
fully covered self-expandable metallic stents.20 They found no 
difference in the proportion of stent-related adverse events 
between stent types except LAMSs, which had the lowest risk 
of stent migration.19 Stent occlusion and migration are man￾ageable with endoscopy and rarely require surgery. In con￾trast, bleeding from the development of a pseudoaneurysm is 
indicated for angiographic embolization, which was the main 
cause of mortality in that series.20
Another report showed a low rate of self-limited bleeding 
in 5 out of 68 patients (7.3%) with WON after LAMS place￾ment.21 A recent meta-analysis with heterogeneous patients 
pooled from 11 studies (n=688) also confirmed the superiority 
of a LAMS over a PS in terms of lower rates of adverse events 
and re-intervention.22
Conclusions
Before considering an endoscopic approach for patients 
with WON, the patient’s age and the location and symptoms 
related to WON are the main parameters to be considered 
before offering treatment. Currently, a step-up strategy is rec￾ommended, particularly when a PS is selected as the drainage 
device. Over many years, there has been an evolution in stent 
selection, from PSs to metallic stents. LAMSs are gaining 
more popularity as they can offer direct EN in fewer sessions 
than PSs. In addition, the MTGT may be performed in a step￾up strategy if only one stent fails to achieve debris clearance.
