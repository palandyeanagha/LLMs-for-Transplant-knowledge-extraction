A B S T R A C T Among other defects in water metab￾olism, adrenal insufficiency is associated with an in￾ability to concentrate urine maximally in both man
and experimental animals. Recent studies in the rabbit
cortical collecting tubule have suggested indirectly
that this defect may result from impaired cyclic AMP
(cAMP) formation in response to antidiuretic hormone
stimulation. In the present study, we examined key
elements of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-dependent
cAMP metabolism in the papillary collecting duct
(PCD), microdissected from 8-d adrenalectomized
(ADX) and sham-operated control rats.
AVP-sensitive adenylate cyclase (ADC) activity in
PCD did not differ between control and ADX rats.
cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity (cAMP-PDIE), mea￾sured at 10'6 M cAMP substrate concentration, was
significantly higher (A + 31.6%) in PCD of ADX rats
compared with controls. Incubation of intact PCD
from ADX rats with AVP resulted in an accumulation
of cAMP (A - 48.5%) significantly lower than observed
in control PCD. Chronic administration of dexameth￾asone reduced cAMP-PDIE activity in PCD of ADX
rats to levels close to or below those observed in control

rat PCD, and also resulted in a restoration of AVP￾stimulated cAMP accumulation to levels approaching
control values.
Results indicate that the impaired maximal urinary
concentrating ability associated with adrenal insuffi￾ciency may be due, at least in part, to a reduced ac￾cumulation of cAMP in response to AVP in the PCD.
This decreased cAMP accumulation results from in￾creased cAMP-PDIE activity in the PCD of ADX rats
and can be corrected by administration of glucocor￾ticoid.
INTRODUCTION
Adrenal insufficiency is associated with a number of
impairments in renal function, including decreased
urinary concentrating ability. Although less frequently
recognized than the impairment in diluting capacity,
this concentrating defect has been observed in both
man (1) and experimental animals (2-4). Recent mi￾croperfusion studies using the rabbit cortical collecting
tubule have suggested that this concentrating defect
may at least in part be due to a blunted hydroosmotic
response to vasopressin (4). Since cyclic AMP (cAMP)
analogues elicited normal hydroosmotic responses in
tubules from adrenalectomized (ADX)1 rabbits, it was
suggested that impaired responsiveness resulted from
a reduced accumulation of cAMP in response to the
hormone.

Adrenal steroids potentiate [8-arginine]-vasopressin
(AVP)-dependent water flow and cAMP accumulation
in the toad bladder (5-7). In contrast, reports con￾cerning the effects of corticosteroid deficiency and
adrenal steroid administration on AVP-dependent
cAMP metabolism in the mammalian kidney remain
equivocal. For example, AVP-dependent adenylate
cyclase activity has been reported to be both decreased
(8) and unchanged (9) in cell-free membrane prepa￾rations of renal medulla from ADX rats compared with
controls. Inconsistent effects of adrenalectomy on
AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in renal medul￾lary slices have also been reported; whereas basal
cyclic AMP levels were found to be higher in ADX
rats in two studies (10, 11), cAMP accumulation in
response to AVP was found to be higher in renal med￾ullary preparations (10), but lower in papillary prep￾arations (11) of ADX rats compared with controls.
We have recently shown that the examination of key
elements of AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism in spe￾cific microdissected segments of the nephron facili￾tates detection of specific alterations in this system (12-
14), which had gone undetected in previous studies
using heterogeneous renal tissue preparations.
Consequently, in the present study, we examined
key elements of AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism in
the papillary collecting duct (PCD), a critically im￾portant component of the renal concentrating mech￾anism, microdissected from 8-d ADX and sham-op￾erated control rats, and, furthermore, we have ex￾amined the effects of glucocorticoid replacement on
this system in ADX animals.
METHODS
Surgically ADX and sham-operated (control) male Sprague￾Dawley rats (200-250 g) were purchased from Johnson Lab￾oratories, Inc., Bridgeview, IL. In steroid treatment exper￾iments (see Results), dexamethasone or saline-filled osmotic
minipumps (Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) were implanted in￾traperitoneally at the time of surgery. After at least 24 h
recovery, the animals were shipped by air to Rochester, MN.
All animals were maintained on standard rat diet (Purina
Laboratory Rat Chow, Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO)
and ad lib. 0.9% sodium chloride drinking solution for a total
of 8 d before being killed. Plasma corticosterone concentra￾tions were measured on arterial blood samples drawn at ran￾dom from both ADX and control rats when they were killed
to confirm successful adrenalectomy. The mean arterial
blood corticosterone concentration in control rats was 36±2.4
jug/100 ml (mean±SEM; n = 8), compared with a value of
0.9±0.4 ug/100 ml (n = 12) in ADX rats, 8 d after surgery.
In vivo studies. Maximal urinary concentrating ability
was assessed in sham-operated, ADX, and dexamethasone￾treated ADX rats. Dexamethasone-filled minipumps were
designed to deliver - 100 Mg/d i.p. Sham-operated and ADX
rats were implanted with 0.9% saline-filled minipumps. All
animals were adapted to metabolic cages for at least 2 d
before the start of urine collection. Control urine collections
were obtained on day 6 postoperative. To test maximal uri￾nary concentrating ability, animals were first dehydrated for
24 h (day 7) by withholding all drinking fluid. Dehydration
was continued on day 8, and in addition, 0.5 U vasopressin
tannate was injected subcutaneously. Urine volume and UO,M
(urine osmolality) was measured for each 24-h collection
period.
Papillary osmolality was determined as described recently
by Stoff et al. (15). Control (sham-operated) and ADX rats
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (6 mg/ 100 g body wt).
The kidney was removed and sectioned along the horizontal
plane with a razor blade; the papilla, medulla, and cortex
were dissected free. Wet tissue weight was rapidly deter￾mined in preweighed test tubes. The test tubes with the tissue
were placed in a boiling water bath and 1 ml of 100°C triple￾distilled water was added to each test tube. The whole pro￾cedure from removal of the kidney to placing tissue in a
100°C water bath took from 3 to 5 min. The tissue electro￾lytes and nonelectrolyte solutes were extracted for 1 h at
100°C after the method of Appelbloom et al. (16). After
extraction at 100°C for 1 h, the tissue plus extract was cooled
to room temperature, reweighed, then spun at 3,500 g for
30 min in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge (Beckman Instru￾ments, Inc., Spinco Div., Palo Alto, CA). The supernatant
was aspirated and osmolality was determined using a Fiske
model 230D osmometer (Fiske Associates, Inc., Burlington,
MA). The supernatant was recombined with the tissue pellet
and dried at 100°C overnight and then reweighed for de￾termination of dry weight.
In vitro studies. PCD were microdissected from the inner
medulla (papilla) of both ADX and control rats according
to the procedure described in detail by Edwards et al. (17).
Briefly, under light pentobarbital anesthesia (6 mg/100 g
body wt), the left kidney was perfused with 20 ml of col￾lagenase medium (for composition, see below) containing
sodium heparin (20 U/ml). Thin corticomedullary tissue
strips were then incubated in aerated collagenase medium
for 60 min at 35°C. The tissue strips were thoroughly rinsed
in microdissection medium (for composition, see below) and
transferred to petri dishes containing the same medium.
Microdissection and all subsequent procedures were per￾formed at 0-4°C. Isolated PCD were transferred in a small
volume of microdissection fluid to 5-mm-diam glass cover
slips (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) seated in the well of
concave bacteriological slides. All tubular samples were pho￾tographed for subsequent length measurements.
Enzyme assays, i.e., adenylate cyclase and cAMP-phos￾phodiesterase (cAMP-PDIE), were performed on disrupted
tubular segments. Tubular disruption (or permeabilization)
was achieved as follows: The microdissection medium was
aspirated off each sample and replaced with 0.5 Ml (for ad￾enylate cyclase assay) or 0.25 ul (for cAMP-PDIE assay) of
hypoosmotic medium (for composition, see below). All sam￾ples were then frozen rapidly on dry ice and stored at -80°C
overnight. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) con￾firmed that storage under these conditions does not affect
adenylate cyclase activity. We have previously reported that
cAMP-PDIE activity is not affected by overnight storage
(18). Samples were allowed to thaw at 4°C before being
assayed for enzyme activities.
Adenylate cyclase activity was measured according to the
method described in detail previously (12, 17-19), with
minor modifications. Tubular samples (1-2-mm total tubular
length) were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in a final volume
of 5.5 Ml consisting of the following (final concentrations):
0.25 mM (a-32P) ATP (4 X 106 cpm/sample), 1 mM cAMP,
3.8 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCI, 20 mM

phosphocreatine, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (pH 7.4). Addi￾tionally, NaCI and urea were added to this incubation cock￾tail in a 1:2 molar ratio to attain a final osmolality of 800
mosM. The reaction was stopped by placing the slides on
dry ice, resulting in almost instantaneous freezing of the
incubation fluid. Each coverslip plus frozen sample was
transferred to individual 12 X 75-mm glass test-tubes located
in crushed dry ice followed by 150 Al of stop solution con￾sisting of 3.3 mM ATP, 5 mM cAMP, 50 mM Tris HCI (pH
7.6), and 3H-cAMP (8 X 103 cpm/sample) to monitor re￾covery. Samples were thawed and diluted with 1 ml of dis￾tilled water. cAMP was separated from other products with
Dowex-50 and aluminum oxide columns according to the
method of Salomon et al. (20).
cAMP-PDIE activity was measured according to the
method described previously (12, 14, 18, 21), but again with
minor modifications. Tubular samples (1-2 mm total tubular
length) were incubated for 15 min at 37°C in a final volume
of 2.5 ul consisting of the following (final concentrations):
10 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCI, pH 8.0
(Mg-EDTA-Tris buffer), with a final substrate concentration
of either 10-6 M or 10-4 M 3H-cAMP (105 cpm).
The reaction was stopped by placing the slides on dry ice,
followed by transfer of each sample plus coverslip to indi￾vidual precooled 12 X 75-mm glass test-tubes. 100 ,l of Mg￾EDTA-Tris buffer was added to each tube while still frozen.
All tubes were then immersed in a boiling water bath for
3 min, cooled on ice, and incubated for a further 15 min at
37°C in the presence of 50 Ml of 5'-nucleotidase (snake venom
from Crotalus atrox, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO:
1 mg/ml). Nucleotides were separated from nucleosides on
QAE-Sephadex columns as described by Wells et al. (22).
To determine the effect of in vitro addition of dexameth￾asone on cAMP-PDIE, freshly microdissected tubular sam￾ples were preincubated in 5 gl of microdissection medium
containing 50 pM dexamethasone or vehicle as appropriate
for 90 min at 37°C. After preincubation, the medium was
removed, the samples were subjected to freezing in hy￾poosmotic medium, and cAMP-PDIE was measured as de￾scribed above.
Basal and AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was mea￾sured on freshly microdissected nephron segments as de￾scribed in detail previously (12, 14, 17, 23). For these in￾cubations, 3-4-mm total tubule length was required to con￾stitute one sample. After transfer to glass cover slips seated
on concave bacteriological slides, followed by photography,
excess microdissection medium was aspirated off and re￾placed with 2.5 Ail of modified Krebs-Ringer Buffer contain￾ing NaCl and urea in a 1:2 molar ratio to achieve a final
osmolality of -800 mosM (for composition, see below) and
also with or without AVP. All samples were incubated for
20 min at 30°C and the reaction stopped by placing slides
on dry ice. Samples and cover slips were transferred while
still frozen into precooled 12 X 75-mm glass test tubes and
100 ul of 50 mM sodium acetate added to each. All tubes
were placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Preliminary
experiments confirmed that this rapid method of cAMP ex￾traction is as efficient as extraction with 10% TCA, a tech￾nique recently applied to microdissected tubules by Torikai
et al. (24).
Tubule samples and standards were acetylated and cAMP
content determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as de￾scribed in detail previously (12, 14, 17, 23). Since the tubules
and incubation medium were transferred directly from in￾cubation chambers into RIA test tubes along with the cover
slips on which they were incubated, and, since all subsequent
steps (solubilization, acetylation, and RIA) were performed
in these tubes, recovery of cAMP was assumed to be complete
(12, 14, 17, 23).
Tubular protein content was determined by a micro￾modification of the colorimetric method of Lowry, as de￾scribed in detail previously (12, 21). Since mean tubular
protein content of PCD microdissected from control rat kid￾neys (0.139±0.006 Mg/mm; mean±SEM; n = 15) did not
differ from that of PCD microdissected from 8-d ADX rats
(0.146±0.008 Mg/mm; mean±SEM; n = 12), all enzyme ac￾tivities and cAMP levels were subsequently expressed rela￾tive to tubular length.
Because of known variations between experiments, PCD
microdissected from control and experimental animals were
always processed and assayed simultaneously. The data were
evaluated statistically by t test for either paired or group
comparisons as appropriate and as specified in Results. P
values < 0.05 were considered to be nonsignificant.
Solutions and materials. The collagenase medium con￾sisted of medium 199 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island,
NY) plus collagenase (0.1%), hyaluronidase (0.1%), and bo￾vine serum albumin (0.1%). Microdissection medium was
medium 199 without the above additives and also without
phenol red indicator. Hypoosmotic medium contained (in
final concentrations): 1 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.1%
bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM Tris HCI (pH 7.4). Mod￾ified Krebs ringer buffer consisted of 175 mM NaCl, 350 mM
urea, 5 mM KCI, 1.2 KCI, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.8 mM CaC12,
10 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris, 2.0 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 7.4.
Hyaluronidase (type 1), bovine serum albumin, cAMP,
and 5'-nucleotidase (from Crotalus atrox) were products of
Sigma Chemical Co. Collagenase (Type 1, 125-250 U/mg)
was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp., Free￾hold, NJ. Sodium heparin (100 U. S. Pharmacopeia U/ml)
was a product of Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL.
Synthetic AVP (385 U/mg), was purchased from Calbi￾ochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA. [a_-32P]ATP (25 Ci/
mmol) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ir￾vine, CA. 3H-cAMP (30-50 Ci/mmol) and RIA kits for the
measurement of cAMP were purchased from New England
Nuclear, Boston, MA. All other compounds and reagents
were of the highest quality available from standard sup￾pliers.
RESULTS
In vivo studies. Maximal urinary concentrating
ability was assessed by measuring UOSM in animals sub￾jected to 48 h drinking-fluid deprivation combined
with a single subcutaneous injection of 0.5 U vaso￾pressin tannate given after the first 24 h of dehydration
(for details, see Methods). Maximum UOSM of 11 ADX
rats was significantly lower (A - 41.9%; P < 0.001;
group t test) than that of sham-operated control ani￾mals (Fig. 1). Tissue osmolality, determined in the
papilla of hydropenic ADX rats (935±80 mosM/kg
H20; mean±SEM; n = 4), did not differ significantly
from that of corresponding control animals (1,136±162
mosM/kg H20; mean±SEM; n = 4). In contrast, max￾imum UOSM in ADX rats receiving dexamethasone in￾traperitoneally via osmotic minipump (designed to
deliver 100 gg dexamethasone/d) was significantly

In vitro studies. Basal adenylate cyclase activity
was slightly, but significantly higher (P < 0.05; group

ever, cAMP accumulation in response to 106 M AVP
was markedly reduced (A - 48.5%; P < 0.005; group
t test) in PCD of ADX rats compared with controls
(Fig. 4).
Since administration of dexamethasone restored
concentrating ability in ADX rats in vivo, subsequent
experiments examined the effects of dexamethasone
treatment (delivered for 8 d via osmotic minipump
intraperitoneally, as before) on key elements of AVP￾dependent cAMP metabolism in PCD of ADX rats.
As in the previous groups of animals, cAMP-PDIE
activity (measured at 106 M cAMP substrate) was sig￾nificantly higher (A + 25.5%; P < 0.05; group t test)
in PCD of ADX rats compared with controls (Fig. 5).
Chronic dexamethasone treatment reduced cAMP￾PDIE activity in ADX rats to values similar to, or some￾what lower than, those measured in PCD of control,
sham-operated rats (Fig. 5). In contrast, incubation of
PCD microdissected from ADX rats with 50 pM dexa￾methasone added in vitro did not decrease cAMP￾PDIE activity (Table I).
Moreover, as observed in the first series of experi￾ments, AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was sig￾nificantly lower (A - 55.6%; P < 0.05; group t test)
in PCD of ADX rats compared with sham-operated
controls (Fig. 6). Dexamethasone treatment increased
AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in PCD of ADX
rats to levels that were significantly greater (A + 68.0%;
P < 0.001; group t test) than those in PCD of non￾dexamethasone-treated ADX rats and that approached
AVP-stimulated cAMP levels observed in PCD of
sham-operated, control rats.

Decreased concentrating ability is a distinct, but less

defect was originally attributed, at least in part, to an
observed decrease in medullary tonicity which would
diminish the driving force for water absorption in col￾lecting tubules (2, 3). In the present study, while UOSM
was markedly diminished, by -1,000 mosM (Fig. 1),
tissue osmolality determined in the papilla of hydro￾penic ADX rats tended to be only slightly lower than
that of corresponding sham-operated control rats.
Thus, although potentially a minor contributing factor,
relatively small decreases in interstitial osmolality
could not fully explain the observed decreases in max￾imum UOSM. Direct evidence for a reduced functional
responsiveness to AVP in the collecting tubule system
was recently provided by the microperfusion studies
of Schwartz and Kokko (4), in which hydroosmotic
responses to AVP in cortical collecting tubules dis￾sected from ADX rabbits were lower than those from
corresponding control tubules. This study (4) also
pointed to the possibility that the decreased hydro￾osmotic responses of adrenal-steroid depleted epithe￾lia to AVP may be due to increased cAMP break￾down, as first suggested by Handler et al. (7) and Stoff
et al. (25), based on studies of toad urinary bladder.
Previous studies of the effects of adrenalectomy on
AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism in the mammalian
kidney (in particular, the medulla and/or papilla) have
yielded inconsistent results (9-11). These inconsisten￾cies may have been due to the heterogeneous nature
of the renal medullary tissue preparations used in these
studies, especially in view of the fact that this zone of
the kidney contains at least two nephron segments with
an AVP-responsive cAMP system, i.e., the thick as￾cending limb of Henle's loop as well as the collecting
tubule (12, 13, 21, 26).
Our present study clearly documents an AVP-de￾pendent renal concentrating defect in the ADX rat
(Fig. 1) and identifies the PCD as a site of abnormal
AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism. Specifically, AVP￾dependent cAMP accumulation is markedly decreased
in PCD of ADX rats compared with controls (Fig. 4).
Since adenylate cyclase activity is not diminished in
response to either maximal or submaximal stimulatory
concentrations of AVP (Fig. 2), decreased cAMP ac￾cumulation is most likely due to the enhanced activity
of cAMP-PDIE detected in this nephron segment (Fig.
3). We have shown in our previous studies on PCD
(15) that the extent of AVP-induced cAMP accumu￾lation increases markedly with increased osmolality of
the medium. Since papillary osmolality tends to be

slightly lower in ADX animals compared with controls
(2, 3), it is possible that the decrease in AVP-dependent
cAMP accumulation seen in ADX tubules in vitro may
be even more pronounced in vivo.
In addition, our studies have demonstrated that both
the functional defect, i.e., the decreased maximal uri￾nary concentrating response to AVP in vivo (Fig. 1),
as well as decreased AVP-dependent cAMP accumu￾lation in vitro (Fig. 6), can be corrected by treatment
with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. A comparison
of the effect of dexamethasone on cAMP-PDIE (Fig.
5) and on cAMP levels (Fig. 6) suggests that the degree
of inhibition of cAMP-PDIE is more pronounced than
the extent to which AVP-dependent cAMP accumu￾lation is restored. This feature might be due at least
in part to the fact that cAMP-PDIE may be exposed
to conditions in vivo that are not identical to those in
vitro. Nevertheless, the directionality of the observed
changes should be stressed; the decrease in cAMP￾PDIE activity associated with an increase in cAMP
accumulation is consistent with the concept that glu￾cocorticoids influence cAMP metabolism by modulat￾ing the activity of cAMP-PDIE. Although the resto￾ration of AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation (Fig.
6) and restoration of in vivo responsiveness to AVP
(Fig. 1) after dexamethasone treatment is likely due
to the observed suppression of cAMP-PDIE activity in
PCD of ADX rats (Fig. 5), the possibility that other
factors may be involved cannot be excluded. One such
possibility that should be examined in future studies
is the potential role of prostaglandins (27). Studies in
the toad bladder (27) have demonstrated that adrenal
steroids may modulate prostaglandin synthesis and
specifically that prostaglandin synthesis is markedly
increased in steroid-depleted bladders. Extrapolating
from amphibian membranes to the mammalian neph￾ron, elevated prostaglandin synthesis in the collecting
tubule of the ADX rat might also potentially contribute
to the observed attenuation of AVP-dependent cAMP
accumulation. The effect of mineralocorticoid hor￾mones on the concentrating defect in ADX animals
also remains to be explored, but the present results
suggest that glucocorticoid replacement alone is fully
capable of correcting the functional defect as well as
the biochemical abnormality in PCD of ADX animals.
The exact mechanism by which dexamethasone
causes a decrease in cAMP-PDIE is not apparent from
the present studies; in vitro addition of this compound
was without effect (Table I). Such a comparison may
indicate that only more prolonged exposure to the ste￾roid and/or other as yet unidentified conditions are
required. Alternatively, dexamethasone might have
acted through some unknown indirect mechanism.
It is of interest to note that the cellular basis of this
concentrating defect appears analogous to that ob￾served previously in studies on a strain of mice with
hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (12). As in
ADX rats, impaired AVP-dependent cAMP accumu￾lation in the medullary collecting tubule of NDI mice
appeared to be due, at least in part, to increased cAMP￾PDIE activity (12). Whether glucocorticoid would
have similar effects in NDI mice to those observed in
ADX rats, namely reduced cAMP-PDIE activity and
restored AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation is of in￾terest and awaits examination.
In conclusion, the present studies suggest that the
decreased concentrating ability associated with adre￾nal insufficiency may be due to reduced AVP-depen￾dent cAMP accumulation in the PCD, and that this
reduced cAMP accumulation is due to enhanced
cAMP-PDIE activity. Selective chronic glucocorticoid
(dexamethasone) treatment reverses both the biochem￾ical and functional impairments, in that it reduces
elevated cAMP-PDIE activity, enhances depressed
AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation on PCD, and re￾stores maximal urinary concentrating ability in vivo.
