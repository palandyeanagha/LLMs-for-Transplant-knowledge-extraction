Abstract. The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
is a significant challenge. Although radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) has emerged as a popular therapeutic option for patients 
with resectable HCC, whether it can achieve comparable 
survival outcomes compared with surgical resection (RES) 
remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to conduct a 
meta‑analysis to assess the survival outcomes of RFA vs. RES 
in patients with early resectable HCC tumors. A Medline, 
Embase, and Cochrane Library search was performed for 
data published between January 2000 and February 2018. A 
meta‑analysis of the efficacy of RFA compared with RES for 
HCC was subsequently performed, with particular emphasis 
on overall survival and disease‑free survival (DFS) rates. 
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated using the random‑effects model. In the present 
study, a total of 13,147 patients with HCC were included; 
of which, 6,727 were treated with RFA and 6,420 were 
treated with RES. The overall survival rates (OR1‑year, 0.757, 
95% CI, 0.578‑0.989; OR3‑year, 0.530, 95% CI, 0.401‑0.700; 
OR5‑year, 0.566, 95% CI, 0.423‑0.758) and the DRS rates 
(OR1‑year, 0.569, 95% CI, 0.456‑0.711; OR3‑year, 0.418, 
95% CI, 0.267‑0.653; OR5‑year, 0.374, 95% CI, 0.231‑0.606) 
of RES were significantly higher than those of RFA. The 
results indicate that RES is superior to RFA for promoting the 
survival of selected patients with resectable HCC. However, 
future randomized controlled trials are required to investigate 
the specific relevance of these modalities in the treatment of 
HCC.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common 
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer‑related death 
worldwide (1). HCC is more common in Asia and Africa 
compared with western countries (2,3). However, incidence 
rates of HCC in western countries have been gradually 
increasing in recent years (3,4).
HCC is treated by surgical resection (RES), radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA), liver transplantation, as well as other methods. 
Currently, the most effective treatment option for patients with 
HCC is a liver transplant; however, due to the lack of available 
donors, this method is not widely used (5). As a consequence, 
RES is considered to be the most popular treatment strategy 
for patients with resectable tumors and good liver function (a 
Child‑Pugh score of A or B) (6‑8). However, only 9‑29% of 
patients with HCC are able to tolerate surgery, either due to poor 
hepatic reserves as a result of potential chronic liver disease, 
or due to the multifocal distribution of tumor nodules (9‑16).
RFA has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for 
the treatment of patients with tumors <3 cm in size. In addi￾tion, RFA is associated with lower mortality rates and shorter 
hospital stays (17‑20). However, only a small number of 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effective￾ness of RFA and RES have been performed (21‑23), and the 
results are contradictory. In addition, the value of these RCTs 
is limited due to a small number of samples analyzed and 
the wide confidence intervals (CIs). A number of studies have 
concluded that RFA is as effective as RES in the treatment of 
solitary and small HCC tumors (21,24‑29). Livraghi et al (29) 
even regarded RFA as the preferable treatment for small, 
resectable HCC tumors (tumor size, ≤2 cm). By contrast, 
other studies arrived at the opposite conclusion (18,30,31). 
RES may improve long‑term disease‑free survival (DFS) 
rates, and potentially increase overall survival (OS) rates, 
when compared with RFA in a subgroup of patients with 
single HCC tumors >2 cm in size and with Child‑Pugh class A 
liver function scores. The conflicting results of these previous 
studies are primarily considered to be related to the relatively 
small sample sizes. Similarly, previously published reviews 
and meta‑analyses present contradictory results. A number 
of these studies concluded that no significant difference in 
death rates following treatment of HCC using RES and RFA

was observed, if disease recurrence following RFA was 
detected in a timely manner and effectively treated (32,33). 
However, the opposite conclusions have been drawn in other 
review studies (17,34). In these studies, it was argued that 
RFA did not decrease the number of overall recurrences and 
had no effect on patient survival when compared with RES 
in a selected group of patients. In addition, RES was superior 
to RFA with regards to overall or recurrence‑free survival. 
The contradictory results from these studies may be due to 
inconsistencies between the subjects recruited, therapeutic 
techniques employed and the evaluation criteria. However, 
a recent systematic review concluded that the indication for 
RFA as a primary treatment for patients with early stage 
HCC that are eligible for RES is unclear, and additional 
well‑designed RCTs are required (35). Ultimately, due to 
the small number of RCTs performed thus far, the hetero￾geneity of different studies and the inherent limitations of 
meta‑analyses, it is currently unclear whether RFA or RES 
is more effective for the treatment of patients with resectable 
HCC. Strong evidence is required to compare RFA and RES 
treatment strategies. Therefore, the aim of the present study 
was to conduct a meta‑analysis of 13,147 patients with HCC to 
compare the therapeutic effects of RFA and RES.
Materials and methods
Literature search. A Medline, Embase, and Cochrane 
Library search was performed for data published between 
January 2000 and February 2018. The following keywords 
were used as search criteria: ‘RFA, radio‑frequency, radio 
frequency or RFA’ AND ‘RES or hepatectomy’ AND ‘liver 
or hepatic or HCC’ with no language restrictions. Additional 
studies were identified by manual searching of the references 
by two reviewers.
Study selection criteria. The following selection criteria for 
studies were applied: i) Those that included patients with no 
previous treatment for HCC; ii) those that included patients 
suitable for treatment with either RES or RFA (based on the 
Milan Criteria) and with liver function Child‑Pugh scores 
of grade A or B; iii) results for at least one of the outcome 
measures, including the 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year OS or DFS rates; 
and iv) studies published in peer‑reviewed journals.
Data extraction. Data was extracted independently by two 
observers and cross‑checked to reach a consensus. The 
following parameters were recorded: Author; journal; date 
of publication; geographical region; number of patients; age; 
sex; liver function; tumor size; Child‑Pugh class; number of 
tumors; death rates; 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year OS rates; and 1‑, 3‑ and 
5‑year DFS rates. The primary authors were contacted to 
retrieve further information where necessary.
Quality assessment. The quality of the RCTs were assessed 
using the Jadad Scoring system (36) and the quality of obser￾vational studies was assessed using the Newcastle‑Ottawa 
Scale (NOS) (37). Although the majority of studies included 
were observational studies, these studies had high NOS 
scores (≥5*
) and were found to be important for directing 
clinical work.
Data analysis. A meta‑analysis was performed according 
to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses guidelines. The 
analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 statistical soft￾ware and Review Manager Version 5.1. For statistical analysis 
of the pooled odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables, which 
correspond to the odds of an event occurring in the treatment 
group (RFA), compared to the control group (RES) was used. 
An OR of >1 indicates that the probability of an outcome is 
more likely to occur in the treatment group, and is considered 
statistically significant when P<0.05 and the 95% CI does not 
include the value 1. The Mantel‑Haenszel method was used 
to combine the ORs for outcomes of interest to the present 
study. A random‑effects model, that is more robust in terms of 
anticipated heterogeneity in patient and hospital‑related risk 
factors, was used for the meta‑analysis due to the consider￾able clinical heterogeneity of surgical procedures and study 
designs (38,39). However, the statistical heterogeneity in each 
meta‑analysis was assessed using the τ2
, χ2
 and I2
 statistics 
parameters. Heterogeneity was regarded as significant if τ2
was >0 and if either the P‑value of χ2 analysis was <0.10 or 
the I2 vale was >50%. Subgroup analyses included: i) A mean 
tumor size of ≤3 cm and (ii) a mean tumor size of >3 cm.
Results
Description of the studies. Out of the 13,147 patients with HCC 
across 25 studies included in the current study, 6,727 were

allocated to the RFA group and 6,420 were allocated to the 
RES group in order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of 
these treatment modalities. The selected studies included 
three RCTs and 20 observational comparative studies. The 
overlap in time of patients was detected in two trials (22,40) 
and the non‑randomly controlled trial was excluded (40). Two 
trials (21,41) were thought to have overlapping data, as they 
were conducted in the same center (21); one was an RCT that 
recruited patients with solitary HCC tumors ≤5 cm in diameter 
between November 1999 and June 2004, while the other (41) 
was a retrospective study that analyzed patient data collected 
between December 2003 to December 2008. As a result, only 
the RCT was included in the current study (Fig. 1). Data from 
patients presenting with a mean tumor size of <3 and >3 cm 
were divided into the subgroup analysis whenever the author 
presented them independently in the study.
Outcome measures
OS rates. The meta‑analysis results demonstrated a 
significant difference in the 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year OS rates 
between the two groups. The OR of 1‑year OS rates of 
the two groups was 0.757 (95% CI, 0.578‑0.989; P=0.042; 
Fig. 2). For the 3‑year OS rates, the OR of the two groups 
was 0.530 (95% CI, 0.401‑0.700; P<0.001; Fig. 3). Finally, 
the OR of 5‑year OS rates in the two groups was 0.566 
(95% CI, 0.423‑0.758; P=0.001; Fig. 4).

DFS rates. The results of the meta‑analysis demonstrated a 
significant difference in the 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year DFS rates between 
the two groups. As indicated in Fig. 5, the OR of 1‑year DFS in 
the two groups was 0.569 (95% CI, 0.456‑0.711; P<0.001). The

ORs of the 3‑ and 5‑year DFS rates between the two groups 
were 0.418 (95% CI, 0.267‑0.653; P<0.001) and 0.374 
(95% CI, 0.231‑0.606; P<0.001), respectively (Figs. 6 and 7).
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup of mean tumor size ≤3 cm. The 3‑ and 5‑year OS 
rates and the 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year DFS rates of the RES group of 
patients with HCC were significantly higher than those of the 
RFA group. The 1‑year OS rate of patients in the RES group 
was not significantly higher than that of the RFA group.
Subgroup of mean tumor size >3 cm. The 5‑year OS rates 
and the 1‑ and 3‑year DFS rates of patients treated with RES 
were significantly different than the RFA treatment group, 
whereas the 1‑ and 3‑year OS rates and the 5‑year DFS rate of 
patients treated with RES were not significantly higher than 
those of the RFA treatment group.
Testing for publication bias. A funnel plot was used to deter￾mine the level of bias (Fig. 8). The funnel plot for 1‑year OS 
rates following RFA or RES shows symmetry, which suggests 
that there was no signficant publication bias. In addition, Begg 
tests were performed to exclude the possibility of asymmetry 
in funnel plots (continuity corrected, z =1.35, P=0.178). The 
results of the Begg tests suggested that chances of publication 
bias were minimal.
Discussion
At present, RES and RFA are commonly used and regarded 
as the curative methods for the treatment of patients with 
small HCC tumors. However, no definite consensus for which 
modality is the most effective has been reached. OS and DFS 
are two common primary indexes used to assess the curative 
effects of treatments for patients with cancer. Each index 
emphasizes different factors. DFS is a significant index that 
reveals the treatment effect of therapeutic modalities employed, 
while OS represents the response to the overall condition, 
including comprehensive treatment modalities, the state of 
patient health, and other relevant factors that influence survival. 
Although DFS is considered to be the more appropriate index 
for evaluating the effect of the therapeutic modalities used, 
in accordance with current practice, both DFS and OS rates 
were used to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of RES 
and RFA in the current study. The results of the meta‑analysis

20 LI et al: A META-ANALYSIS OF RFA VS. RESECTION FOR HCC
demonstrated that RES was superior to RFA with regards to 
the survival of patients with resectable HCC. This is because 
the 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year OS and DFS rates of patients treated using 
RFA were generally lower than those treated with RES. RFA 
techniques use thermal effects to kill tumor cells (42‑44). The 
ablation process is influenced by numerous factors, such as 
overall energy deposition, the duration of application, elec￾trode types or tip length and gauge. In addition, if ablation 
is applied with or without pulsed radiofrequency or cluster 
techniques, this may result in instability of the required RFA 
therapy effect (45‑47), and may lead to higher recurrence 
rates. By contrast, RES has been demonstrated to eliminate 
cancer nodules thoroughly and prevent recurrence (32,48,49). 
Therefore, the OS and DFS rates of patients treated using RFA 
are lower than that of RES. Mulier et al (50) concluded that the 
short‑term benefits of using a less invasive method through the 
percutaneous route of RFA does not counteract the increased 
long‑term risk of local recurrence (Belgium and Netherlands). 
Therefore, the authors of the present study consider that RES 
may serve an important role in the treatment of patients with 
HCC (8). As such, clinicians treating HCC patients within the 
Milan criteria should consider hepatectomy as the primary 
treatment option if the patient's liver function and general 
condition are sufficient for surgery (51) (Korea).
At present, RFA is frequently used as a first‑line treatment 
option for patients with HCC tumors as large as 5 cm (52). It 
is generally considered that the smaller the lesion, the better 
the effect of treatment. Peng et al (41) demonstrated that the 
OS rates, but not the recurrence‑free survival rates, of percuta￾neous RFA were significantly improved when compared with 
those of RES in patients with HCC tumors measuring ≤2 cm. 
In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with central HCC 
(where the tumor is located >3 cm from the liver capsule), 
the OS and recurrence‑free survival rates of percutaneous 
RFA were improved when compared with RES (China). 
This previous study provided an explanation for the superior 
effect of RFA when compared with RES. However, it did not 
provide an explanation for the worse relative efficacy of RES, 
aside from the observation that patients treated using this 
method had more severe complications. The conclusions of 
this previous study contradicted the majority of other relevant 
studies (18,30,31,53). Guo et al collated and performed a 
meta‑analysis of previous studies to assess the outcomes 
of combined transcatheter arterial chemoemobolization 
(TACE)‑RFA vs. RES alone in patients with early HCC and 
small resectable tumors. The results demonstrated that, even 
though TACE‑RFA showed comparable 1‑ and 3‑year OS rates 
and 1‑year recurrence‑free rates compared with RES, this 
combination was associated with significantly lower 3‑year 
recurrence‑free survival rates compared with RES. Therefore, 
the authors concluded that RES should still be considered 
as the primary choice of treatment for patients with early 
HCC (54).
In the present study, subgroup analysis was performed to 
better compare the outcomes of RES and RFA in patients with 
HCC. To achieve this, patients were divided into two subgroups 
based on mean tumor size (~3 cm). In the group of patients 
with tumors ≤3 cm in size, those treated with RES demon￾strated significantly improved 3‑ and 5‑year OS rates, as well 
as 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year DFS rates, compared with those treated 
with RFA. It was therefore considered that if patients are in 
good physical condition and have good liver function, treat￾ment using RES may likely increase their OS. In the group of 
patients with a mean tumor size of >3 cm, those treated using 
RES demonstrated significantly higher 5‑year OS rates and 
1‑ and 3‑year DFS rates compared to those treated using RFA; 
however, no significant difference between the 1‑ and 3‑year 
OS rates, and the 5‑year DFS rates was observed between these 
groups. Based on the results of the present study, the authors 
recommend a therapeutic regimen for patients with small HCC 
tumors, as presented in the flow‑chart (Fig. 9).
In current studies, local intrahepatic recurrences were 
found to be more frequent following RFA when compared with 
RES. Local recurrences following RFA may be attributable to 
insufficient ablation of the primary tumor and/or the presence 
of tumor venous invasion in the adjacent liver tissue. By 
contrast, RES may remove the primary tumor and venous 
tumor thrombi (32) which may explain the improved survival 
rates following RES.
An ideal meta‑analysis should include individual patient 
data. However, these data are not always available or may be 
impractical to collect. Therefore, the majority of meta‑analyses, 
including the current study, are instead performed using 
summary data, which is an accepted form of analysis. However, 
in the present study, it was not possible to perform a complete 
analysis of the causes of death in the selected studies due to the 
lack of individual patient data. Another limitation of the current 
study was that numerous observational studies included in the 
analysis had significant heterogeneity due to the nature of the 
surgical studies. Specifically, it is difficult to perform the same 
operations across different hospitals. Therefore, the outcomes 
of the RES procedure across different centers may be, to some 
extent, not comparable. In addition, bias caused by a number 
of different factors, such as case selection, patient condition, 
medical equipment and the individual dependence of surgical 
techniques may affect statistical analysis of the results. In order 
to perform more rigorous testing, a random‑effects model was 
used for the meta‑analysis. The inclusion of a limited number 
of RCTs from original published studies is another important 
limitation of the current study, and meta‑analyses have been 
traditionally applied and are best confined to RCTs. However, 
it has also been demonstrated that meta‑analytical techniques 
using non‑RCT and observational studies may present a valid 
method in some clinical settings, where either the number or 
the sample size of RCTs is insufficient (55) (France).
In conclusion, this meta‑analysis of studies compared the 
long‑time survival rates of RFA and RES techniques for the 
treatment of patients with HCC. RES was demonstrated to 
show superior 1‑, 3‑ and 5‑year OS and DFS rates than RFA 
for patients with small HCC that were eligible for surgical 
treatment. However, RFA can be an alternative therapeutic 
option for patients with small single HCC tumors that are not 
suitable for RES. Future RCTs are required to clarify the value 
of RES and RFA for the treatment of patients with HCC.
