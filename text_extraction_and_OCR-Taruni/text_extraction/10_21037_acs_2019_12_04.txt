Background: Lung transplantation has long been the accepted therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrotic 
disease. Presently, there is an ongoing debate over whether single or bilateral transplantation is the most 
appropriate treatment for end-stage disease, with a paucity of high-quality evidence comparing the two 
approaches head-to-head.
Methods: This review was performed in accordance with PRISMA recommendations and guidance. 
Searches were performed on PubMed Central, Scopus and Medline from dates of database inception to 
September 2019. For the assessed papers, data was extracted from the reviewed text, tables and figures, by 
two independent authors. Estimated survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for studies where 
time-to-event data was provided. 
Results: Overall, 4,212 unique records were identified from the literature search. Following initial 
screening and the addition of reference list findings, 83 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 
17 were included in the final analysis, with a total of 5,601 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis illustrated 
improved survival in patients receiving bilateral lung transplantation (BLTx) than in those receiving 
unilateral transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at all time intervals, with aggregated survival for 
BLTx at 57%, 35.3% and 24% at 5-, 10- and 15-year follow-up, respectively. Survival rates for SLTx were 
50%, 27.8% and 13.9%, respectively. 
Conclusions: Whilst a number of studies present conflicting results with respect to short-term 
transplantation outcomes, BLTx confers improved long-term survival over SLTx, with large-scale registries 
supporting findings from single- and multi-center studies. Through an aggregation of published survival 
data, this meta-analysis identified improved survival in patients receiving BLTx versus SLTx at all time 
intervals.

Systematic Review
Introduction
Lung transplantation has long been an accepted therapy 
for end-stage pulmonary fibrotic disease given the poor 
long-term prognosis of patients managed with medical and 
conservative treatment (1). Presently, there is an ongoing 
debate over whether single (SLTx) or bilateral (BLTx) 
lung transplantation is the most appropriate treatment, 
with a paucity of high-quality evidence comparing the two 
approaches head-to-head (2). As such, practice is still largely 
specific to the institution or to the surgeon’s preference. 
Historically, SLTx has been used under the rationale 
that it is a more limited operation and hence is more 
appropriate for high-risk candidates; however, as surgical 
techniques have improved, bilateral transplantation—
particularly with its increasingly acceptable long-term

morbidity and mortality—has become predominant. Given 
the heterogeneity of interstitial lung diseases, particularly 
in terms of their etiology and pathophysiology, substantive 
subgroup analysis to date has been hindered outside of 
registry findings, with patient outcomes highly variable 
within the literature (3). The present systematic review 
will detail the mid- and late-term outcomes after SLTx vs.
BLTx for pulmonary fibrotic disease and will provide an 
aggregation of the present data on survival outcomes. 
Methods
Literature search 
This review was performed in accordance with PRISMA 
recommendations and guidance (4,5). Electronic searches 
were performed on PubMed Central, Scopus and Medline 
from dates of database inception to September 2019, using 
the terms (“lung transplantation” OR “lung transplant”) 
AND (“single” OR “unilateral” OR “bilateral” OR 
“double”) AND (“pulmonary fibrosis” OR “idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis”) as either keywords or MeSH headings. 
After removal of duplicate records, studies were screened 
according to their titles and abstracts, then reviewed 
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria detailed 
below by two independent authors (AR Wilson-Smith, 
YS Kim). Conflicts were resolved by the senior researcher 
(AR Wilson-Smith). A PRISMA diagram of the search 
strategy is presented in Figure S1. Additional references for 
discussion were obtained by reference list searches, or via 
targeted database searches.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were eligible for this review if they had at least ten 
patients in their cohorts and where transplantation (either 
SLTx or BLTx) was indicated primarily for idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Follow-up of a minimum of one 
year was also required. Non-English records, review articles, 
conference and paper abstracts, editorials, letters, case 
reports, series, and opinions were excluded. Studies were 
excluded from analysis if they failed to delineate between 
SLTx and BLTx outcomes, or if no mention was made of 
the outcome between the two approaches qualitatively. 
Studies which aggregated etiologies in their survival 
analysis (e.g., IPF + cystic fibrosis + chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease) were excluded from quantitative 
analysis, as were emergent surgeries. Duplicate studies 
were removed prior to the commencement of the literature 
screen and only the most up-to-date references from 
ongoing studies or registries were reviewed for statistical 
aggregation to minimize patient overlap. Studies were 
also excluded if they did not present baseline patient 
characteristics, or if the study was centered on pediatric 
patients (i.e., those <18 years). 
Data extraction, statistical analysis and presentation
For the assessed papers, data was extracted from the 
reviewed text, tables and figures. Data was extracted 
independently by two independent authors (AR Wilson￾Smith, YS Kim) into Microsoft Excel. Discrepancies were 
reviewed and discussed until a consensus was reached. 
Findings are presented in Tables 1-3. Estimated survival 
was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method in studies 
where time-to-event data was provided (6). Censoring 
was assumed to be constant, unless the particular curve 
had a long follow-up of only minimal patients—in which 
case, censoring was manually entered. Death events and 
censoring data were compiled for the entire patient cohort 
and overall survival curves were produced using R Studio (7).
Quality assessment of included studies
An appraisal schema based on the Canadian National 
Institute of Health Economics’ (CNIHE) Quality 
Assessment Tool (i.e., the modified Delphi technique) for 
case series studies was employed to evaluate all included 
studies (Figure S2). Studies were categorized based on the 
following domains: clarity of study objective, adequate 
description of the study population, description of the 
intervention, adequate reporting of outcome measures, 
appropriate reporting of results/conclusions (quality 
findings are listed in Table 1, criteria are provided in 
Figure S2). Studies were considered to be of high quality if 
they addressed at least 15 of the 19 criteria outlined in the 
CNIHE tool. Moderate quality was defined as 13–15 of 19 
and low quality below 13 of 19.
Results
Overall, 4,212 unique records were identified from the 
literature search (Figures S1,S3). Following initial screening 
and the addition of reference list findings, 83 full-text 
articles were assessed for their eligibility, of which 17 were 
included in the final analysis. Six studies were included

in the quantitative synthesis (8-13). The search of 4,212 
records yielded 17 studies which met inclusion criteria, 
with a total of 5,601 patients. The majority of studies (90%) 
were found to be of high quality according to the CNIHE 
tool, with the remainder as moderate quality. The majority 
of studies included in the final analysis were from European 
or United States centers, with the remainder being drawn 
from Asian, Canadian or Central American centers. 
Survival—SLTx vs. BLTx
All curves digitized and aggregated in this study were 
unadjusted. Aggregated survival for SLTx at 5-, 10- 
and 15-year time intervals was 50%, 27.8% and 13.9%, 
respectively. Survival for BLTx was 57%, 35.3% and 24%, 
respectively (Figure 1). 
Morbidity—SLTx vs. BLTx
Reported morbidity findings are detailed in Table 3. Three 
studies outlined morbidity data quantitatively (8,10,11). 
Length of hospital stay was statistically significant in two 
studies in favor of SLTx. Length of ICU stay was only 
significant in one study in favor of SLTx. All other reported 
complication rates were not statistically significant between 
the two surgical modalities.
Discussion
SLTx vs. BLTx: head-to-head studies
Out of the seven studies that present survival rates of BLTx 
vs. SLTx specifically for IPF patients, three of these studies 
establish improved survival in patients receiving SLTx. 
De Oliveira et al. demonstrate in 79 patients that survival 
is better in SLTx up to 5 years. The 1-, 3-, 5-year survival 
rates of SLTx vs. BLTx were 81.8% vs. 73%, 65.4% vs.
60.2%, 62.7% vs. 53.5% (P=0.68), respectively (8). The 
10-year survival rate was 39% vs. 42.8%, respectively. 
Meyers et al. demonstrate survival rates of SLTx vs. BLTx 
being 81% vs. 77%, 63% vs. 54% and 50% vs. 38% for 
the 1-, 3- and 5-year endpoints (P=0.42) (10). These rates 
were established in 32 SLTx and 13 sequential BLTx; no 
difference in in-hospital mortality between SLTx (9.40%) 
and BLTx (7.70%) was noted. 
The most recent single center study by Wei et al. (11) 
demonstrated survival rates in a cohort of 109 patients of 
80.8% vs. 66.7% and 73.8% vs. 63.3% for SLTx vs. BLTx, 
at 1- and 2-year survival, respectively (P=0.13). When the 
survival rates of SLTx vs. BLTx in IPF patients are further 
stratified by age <60 and age >60, SLTx had significantly 
greater survival in the over-60 age-group (P=0.008).
The other studies align with the findings of the UNOS 
Registry and ISHLT registry, which outline that BLTx has 
improved survival for IPF patients over SLTx (14-22). In 
their cohort of 469 patients, 82 of which had IPF, Mason 
et al. found that patients receiving BLTx had better risk￾unadjusted survival than those receiving SLTx, with 1-year 
survival at 81% and 67%, and 5-year survival at 55% and 
34%, respectively. BLTx survival rates were similar to those 
for non-IPF indications (9). Following matched analysis, 
the benefit of BLTx over SLTx was not maintained, with 
perioperative mortality and short-term postoperative 
mortality both at 6% (10). 
Neurohr et al. found a significant survival benefit of 
BLTx over SLTx in their cohort of 76 patients at 1-year 
and in overall survival (P=0.026) (13). Although SLTx had 
a higher percentage of acute rejection (35.6%) compared 
to BLTx (29.6%), this was not statistically significant; 
however, there was a significantly higher number of deaths 
in SLTx compared to BLTx as a result of the development 
of bronchiolitis obliterans. Kreisel et al. demonstrate 
a higher survival rate in BLTx for the 5- and 10-year 
mark (23). Interestingly, Kreisel extracted data from 1988 
to 2009, including the data used in the Meyers et al. (10) 
study from the same institution (1988–1998); however, it 
appears that the data from the extended 10-year follow￾up reversed the survival benefit that SLTx had over BLTx 
found by Meyers et al. (10) One reason for this finding may 
be improved surgical technique of BLTx within the last ten

years, or alternatively, BLTx may in fact have improved 
long-term survival benefits after the initial convalescence 
period. Keating et al. (12) demonstrated a survival rate 
pattern similar to that of De Oliveira et al. (8) up to 
the 3-year mark, the survival rate was higher for SLTx 
compared to BLTx; however, at the 5-year mark, BLTx 
conferred a higher survival rate of 50% compared to SLTx 
at 29%.
Six studies outlined findings for IPF patients undergoing 
transplantation but did not stratify for surgical approach 
with quantitative analysis. For instance, Algar et al. found 
that survival did not differ between SLTx and BLTx at 
long-term follow-up, noting that whilst BLTx conferred 
increased mortality in the short-term, the long-term 
survival benefit offset the initial mortality (24). A number of 
studies compared SLTx and BLTx, but did not differentiate 
for etiology. de Perrot et al. (15) found in their cohort of 
501 patients, long-term survival was higher in patients 
receiving BLTx vs. patients receiving SLTx (P=0.07); 
when separately analyzing for etiology (i.e., cystic fibrosis, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, IPF, etc.) this effect 
disappeared; however, no data were presented in-text. 
Database analysis of IPF patient outcomes
Villavicencio et al. (25) presents the most recent data 
comparing survival outcomes of SLTx vs. BLTx 
in IPF recipients. This study includes 9,191 lung 
transplant recipients with IPF from 1987 to 2015. 
They have demonstrated that BLTx has improved 
survival outcomes in IPF patients compared to SLTx 
across all lung allocation scores and additionally 
when adjusted for age, excepting those exceeding 
70 years (P<0.001). The International Society for Heart 
and Lung Transplantation Registry (ISHLT) have collated 
the survival outcomes of SLTx vs. BLTx in IPF patients 
and presented their data on transplant recipients with IPF 
from January 1990 to June 2016. Kaplan-Meier curves 
were produced from 1,043 SLTx patients with IPF and 
1,936 BLTx patients with IPF. BLTx was shown to have 
improved survival outcomes compared to SLTx at each year 
from the 1st year to the 16th year (P<0.0001). 
Limitations
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the most recent and 
thorough systematic review of the literature comparing 
SLTx to BLTx in the context of IPF and the only review 
to incorporate an aggregation of survival data across single￾and multi-center studies and registries.
However, are several limitations with respect to the 
present review. The number of single- and multi-center 
studies analyzing the survival outcomes of IPF patients 
with clear stratification of which patients received SLTx 
and BLTx was low, with only 17 studies meeting the final 
inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies provided 
survival outcomes of IPF recipients compared to other 
transplant recipients of varying indications, and/or survival 
outcomes comparing SLTx vs. BLTx in all transplant 
recipients. Only six studies—with one potentially replicated 
dataset—were able to stratify survival outcomes by SLTx vs.
BLTx specifically for IPF patients. 
The limited number of studies with survival outcomes 
and stratification between surgical approaches prevented 
meaningful quantitative analysis of the single- and multi￾center studies, requiring an aggregation of the findings from 
large registries. It is likely that there is a degree of patient 
overlap, as patients within the registries would have been 
drawn from these single- and multi-center studies; however, 
using the methods of Sampson et al. who present techniques 
for identifying cohort overlap, this was mitigated as far as 
possible (26). Although registry studies are extremely useful 
(i.e., they benefit from large numbers that allow for sound 
statistical analysis), it is of note that they include and collate 
data from a wide array of centers, with surgeons of variable 
expertise, using different surgical protocols and incomplete 
patient data. Hence, in centers which have always preferred 
one technique over another become highly proficient in 
that technique; it would not be surprising to note outcomes 
that go against the findings from registry data. 
The primary constraint of this review is that the 
single- and multi-center studies identified have often 
yielded conflicting results, with largely uninterpretable or 
sparsely reported data (from a meta-analytical perspective) 
supporting their recommendations; often, no differentiation 
is made between the indications for transplantation (e.g., 
cystic fibrosis, IPF, etc.) or which patients are receiving 
what type of intervention (i.e., SLTx or BLTx). Further, 
very limited morbidity data were reported, with only three 
studies comparing SLTx and BLTx for IPF providing 
quantitative results (Table 3). Often, authors would make 
comments in their discussions noting that one technique 
was more favorable in terms of survival or complications, 
but with no analysis to substantiate the claims.
In order to carry out definitive analysis, it is critical that 
patients with different pathologies are not grouped and

vice versa for transplantation technique, as the level of 
heterogeneity strongly calls into question the validity of the 
findings. It is imperative that for future analysis of survival 
outcomes, clinicians and researchers provide datasets which 
have been stratified appropriately for etiology as well as for 
surgical approach.
Conclusions
Whilst a number of studies present conflicting results 
with respect to short-term transplantation outcomes, the 
consensus is that BLTx confers improved long-term survival 
over that of SLTx, with large-scale registries supporting the 
findings from single- and multi-center studies. Through an 
aggregation of the present survival data, this meta-analysis 
identified improved survival in patients receiving BLTx 
versus those receiving SLTx at all time intervals.
