Sepsis is a devastating disease process characterized by a systemic
inflammatory response in the host, evoked by a known or suspected
pathogen. Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a leading etiologic
agent of sepsis, owing to its propensity to cause deep-seated tissue
infection and bacteremia [1]. S. aureus harbors an arsenal of
virulence factors to facilitate tissue adhesion, immune evasion, and
host cell injury. In the bloodstream, these factors cause inflamma￾tion, impair immune cell function, alter coagulation, and compro￾mise vascular integrity. This review will discuss key secreted and
surface-anchored proteins required for S. aureus infection in the
hostile host environment of the bloodstream, emphasizing mech￾anistic insights on virulence factor function that illustrate the
complex nature of the host–pathogen interaction. While we
currently lack a clear understanding of the temporal and spatial
integration of these virulence factors in the bloodstream, it is
apparent that S. aureus triggers pathophysiologic disturbances that
are further amplified by the host inflammatory response, culminat￾ing in the severe clinical manifestations of sepsis and septic shock.
Inflammation: An Early S. aureus Insult in Sepsis
The clinical manifestations of sepsis span a continuum of severity,
in the most extreme form termed ‘‘septic shock,’’ in which vascular
insults and systemic inflammation lead to compromised cardiac
function and blood pressure, culminating in impaired oxygen delivery
to the tissues and organ failure. In the United States, ,750,000
individuals suffer from sepsis per year, with mortality rates that
approach or even exceed 50% in severe disease [2]. Multiple clinical
trials aimed at curbing the host inflammatory response to severe
infection have yielded limited clinical success [3]. The mainstay of
therapy for sepsis and septic shock remains 2-fold: (1) rapid treatment
of the underlying infection and (2) early resuscitation to blunt
physiologic abnormalities that potentiate disease progression [4]. The
nature of these beneficial interventions focuses attention on rigorously
defining the inciting insult caused by the pathogen.
Multiple S. aureus proteins and cell wall components are pro￾inflammatory, eliciting host responses similar to gram-negative
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [5]. The production of cytokines,
including TNF-a and IL-6, results from the action of S. aureus
lipoproteins on mononuclear phagocytes through TLR-2 pathway
activation [6,7]. Furthermore, bloodstream exposure of rat hosts to
peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid leads to induction of IL-1 and
IFN-c [8]. Toxin-induced cellular injury also elicits prominent
host inflammatory responses. In the bloodstream, circulating
immune cells and the vascular endothelium are primary targets of
staphylococcal virulence factors. Among the longest studied of
these toxins are the staphylococcal superantigens that potently
stimulate non-specific T-cell proliferation and activation and
potentiate the host inflammatory response associated with sepsis
[9]. A family of bi-component leukotoxins including Panton￾Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), Leukocidin AB/GH (LukAB/GH),
Leukocidin ED (LukED), and c-hemolysin (Hlg) injure an array of
leukocytes including neutrophils, mononuclear phagocytes, and T
cells [10]. Also contributing to leukocyte injury is the family of
cytolytic peptides termed phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) [11]
and the small pore-forming toxin a-hemolysin (a-toxin, Hla)
(Figure 1a) [12]. Genetic regulatory control that leads to increased
production of PVL, PSMs, and a-toxin in highly virulent
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has been described
as a molecular mechanism that underlies increased disease severity
observed upon infection with these isolates [13–15]. These
virulence factors are potent stimulants of leukocyte inflammatory
responses [10,12,16]. S. aureus mutants engineered to lack
expression of even one of these toxins exhibit virulence defects
in experimental infection [11,17–19], suggesting that the collective
impact of this group of toxins on inflammation and destabilization
of the host during bloodstream infection is substantial.
Escape from Innate Immune Cells: A Key to
Bloodstream Survival
In concert with direct leukocyte injury, S. aureus utilizes a
number of strategies to modulate the innate host immune response
and prevent bacterial clearance in the bloodstream [20]. Most
clinical S. aureus isolates express a polysaccharide capsule that
affords protection against phagocyte-mediated clearance; further￾more, the pathogen is able to resist killing in the phagocyte. S.
aureus also secretes factors that function to dampen leukocyte
recruitment or prevent opsonophagocytic uptake as a predecessor
to intracellular killing. Two of the best-studied of these proteins are
CHemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of Staphylococci (CHIPS) and
Staphylococcal Complement INhibitor (SCIN). CHIPS binds to
the cellular receptors for C5a and N-formyl peptides, diminishing
the ability of both bacterial peptides and complement activation to
function as leukocyte chemoattractants (Figure 1b) [21,22]. SCIN

potently inhibits human complement pathway defenses by
blocking C3 convertase activity, reducing the deposition of the
C3b opsonin on S. aureus and decreasing neutrophil uptake and
killing [23] (Figure 1c). Both of these staphylococcal virulence
factors display human specificity and are secreted during early
bacterial growth to provide rapid evasion of innate immunity [24].
To limit the function of innate immune cells that successfully
circumvent anti-chemotactic signals, S. aureus utilizes the cell-wall–
anchored Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) to preclude antibody￾driven opsonophagocytic clearance. SpA binds to the Fc and Fab
regions of host antibodies [25], preventing staphylococcal antigen
recognition and Fc-mediated effector functions. SpA also engages
the B cell receptor and initiates activation-induced apoptotic death
of VH3+ B cells (Figure 1d) [26]. S. aureus SpA mutants display
virulence defects in an intraperitoneal model of lethal infection as
well as intravenous infection that leads to arthritis and renal
abscess formation [27–29]. Immunization with an inactive, ‘‘non￾toxinogenic’’ SpA variant is protective in lethal S. aureus sepsis,
promoting opsonophagocytic clearance in the blood [28]. In
addition to these immunoevasion strategies and the broadly toxic
effects of the array of staphylococcal toxins on host immune cells
[10–12], recent studies indicate a prominent role for LukED in
bloodstream infection by virtue of its ability to injure monocytes
and lymphocytes, diminishing phagocytic uptake and promoting
pathogen dissemination [18,30]. Collectively, these bacterial
defense mechanisms increase the burden of staphylococci in the
blood, further compromising the septic host.
Modulation of Intravascular Coagulation: A Host–
Pathogen Tug-of-War
Coagulopathy is another hallmark of septic shock, manifest
as pathologic clotting within the microvasculature and a
predisposition toward systemic bleeding [3]. S. aureus encodes
virulence factors that modulate both soluble and cell-mediated
pathways of coagulation. Physiologic coagulation in response to
injury requires the rapid, localized activation of platelets, together
with activation of the soluble clotting cascade. This serine
protease-based cascade culminates in the enzymatic conversion
of prothrombin to thrombin, in turn promoting the cleavage of
fibrinogen to soluble fibrin monomers that polymerize into
insoluble fibrin. Platelet-fibrin matrices form a physical substrate
for plugging of the injured vasculature. While these processes are
tightly regulated to ensure hemostasis yet avoid untoward
intravascular thrombosis, bacterial virulence factors and the
underlying host inflammatory state in sepsis induce pathologic
alterations of coagulation. The staphylococcal virulence factors
coagulase (Coa) and von Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp)
promote the non-catalytic activation of prothrombin, yielding
cleavage of soluble fibrinogen to engender fibrin clot formation in
the absence of an inciting injury [31,32]. Fibrin clots promote
clumping factor protein-mediated (ClfA and ClfB) aggregation of
staphylococci (Figure 1e) [27]. Agglutination of S. aureus in the
blood promotes bacterial survival, noted by the significant
virulence defect in S. aureus strains that lack expression of Coa,
vWbp, and ClfA [33]. In this context, survival is favored by
protection of the aggregated organisms against phagocytic
clearance. As activation of host coagulation pathways is proin￾flammatory [34], manipulation of this pathway by S. aureus likely
contributes to the systemic inflammatory response.
Recent observations indicate the importance of thrombosis in
immunodefense [35], demonstrating that platelets confer anti￾staphylococcal immunity to bloodstream infection [36]. Intravital
imaging revealed that platelets form aggregates around staphylo￾cocci adhered to macrophage-like Kupffer cells associated with the
liver sinusoidal endothelium, entrapping S. aureus and facilitating

pathogen clearance (Figure 1f) [36]. Suggesting the host-protective
role of these traps, experimental platelet depletion leads to
increased mortality from bloodstream infection [36]. While the
role of platelets as innate immune cells has recently gained
considerable attention, the modulation of normal platelet function
by S. aureus has long been suggested by the ability of a-toxin to
initiate platelet activation and aggregation [37]. a-toxin–induced
platelet activation would thereby seem to promote the formation
of platelet traps and support bacterial clearance—a paradoxical
‘‘anti-virulence’’ effect, highlighting the need to further investigate
the precise molecular mechanisms by which staphylococcal
virulence factors modulate platelet function in innate immunity.
The Microvascular Endothelium: A Site of
Coordination?
Blood flow presents a major hurdle to both the pathogen and
the host during intravascular infection. The ability of immune cells
to identify and then contain S. aureus in the context of a branching
vascular tree and the dilutional effects of blood flow is challenged.
Conversely, the pathogen is challenged to (1) constrain the delivery
of soluble virulence factors that initiate pathologic coagulation in
flowing blood and (2) overcome fluid shear stress to adhere to the
vascular wall and promote dissemination. Fibronectin-binding
protein A (FnBPA) is a surface-displayed protein that facilitates
endothelial adherence (Figure 1g) [38]. Variations in FnBPA
underlie differences in fibronectin-binding affinity; high-affinity
variants enhance endothelial cell binding and correlate with
increased endothelial invasion in bloodstream infection [38]. The
initial tethering of S. aureus to the endothelium may favor the
establishment of a microenvironment in the small vessels or slow￾flow vessels, such as liver sinusoids, in which S. aureus–induced
coagulation and aggregate formation enhances the localized
elaboration of virulence factors (Figure 1h) [39].
A primary molecular mechanism for bacterial-induced vascular
permeability is endothelial disruption due to extreme inflamma￾tion [34]. In addition to its role in leukocyte and platelet injury,
recent studies suggest that a-toxin co-opts the function of its
cellular receptor A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10)
to disrupt the endothelial barrier by promoting the untimely
cleavage of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, destroying the
inter-cellular junction that is required for vascular integrity [17].
As an intact endothelium forms the principal physical barrier to
intravascular dissemination of bacterial pathogens, disruption of
this barrier is expected to promote dissemination, a common and
severe consequence of S. aureus sepsis. Damaged endothelium is
also a potent stimulus for the rapid recruitment of platelets and
activation of soluble clotting cascades. The microvascular endo￾thelial surface may, thus, form a site wherein the pathogen, its
armamentarium of virulence factors, platelets, leukocytes, and host
coagulation proteins are co-localized. This ‘‘coordination’’ site
may simultaneously trigger microvascular occlusion and increased
vascular permeability—events that decrease effective blood flow to
the tissues and precipitate sepsis-associated vital organ failure.
Towards the Future: Insights That May Change S.
aureus Sepsis
The devastating mortality of sepsis and the inability of current
clinical approaches to mitigate disease testify to our limited
understanding of the complex host–pathogen interaction in the
bloodstream. While the virulence factors discussed herein each
contributes to sepsis pathogenesis, loss of any one factor is
insufficient for complete protection against experimental S. aureus
challenge. Similarly, vaccine approaches that target isolated
virulence factors do not provide complete protection against lethal
sepsis [40]. Together, these observations highlight our need to
understand the temporospatial regulation of virulence factor
expression and action in vivo. While exaggerated host inflamma￾tory responses are associated with the progression of severe septic
shock, insults directly delivered by S. aureus—coagulopathy,
immune cell injury, microvascular occlusion, and barrier dam￾age—collectively mirror disease endpoints in sepsis. These insults
likely initiate the very pathophysiologic state that is then
exacerbated by an untoward host response. While multiple
blood-borne bacteria incite endothelial injury and lead to a
coagulopathic state manifested as sepsis [41], whether a deliberate
pathogen-driven coordination of these events occurs to promote
virulence requires further study. The host–pathogen interaction in
the bloodstream has proven extremely challenging to redirect in
favor of the host, in spite of the commonality of these observed
physiologic disturbances. The essential role of bacterial virulence
factors as catalysts of sepsis, however, suggests that a keen focus on
understanding how these factors are integrated in time and space
within the vasculature should yield new insights for sepsis
prevention and therapy in the coming years.
