Abstract
Background: Many patients who receive lung transplantation (LT) operations develop varying degrees of bronchiolitis
obliterans (BO) after the surgeries. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to be related to the process of
bronchiolitis obliterans. In this study we simulated the pathological process of post-lung transplantation bronchiolitis
obliterans, and explored the correlation between BO and EMT of small airway epithelial cells.
Methods: We transplanted the left lungs of F344 rats to Lewis rats by the Tri-cuff anastomosis and established the
allogeneic rat left lung orthotopic transplantation model. Cyclosporine and lipopolysaccharide were administrated
appropriately after the surgery. The histological structure and the expression levels of the EMT markers was observed
with the methods of HE staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry. The analysis of enumeration data was
performed using Fisher’s Exact test and Spearman’s rank correlation was used for the correlation analysis.
Results: Inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroplasia of bronchiole walls and significant lumen stenosis were found in the
pulmonary mesenchyme of the transplanted lungs. The positive expression rate of E-cadherin in the transplanted lungs
was 38.50% (5/13), significantly lower than that in the normal lung tissues [87.50% (7/8)] (P < 0.05), while the positive
expression rate of Vimentin was 76.92% (10/13) which is significantly higher than that in the normal lung tissues
[25.00% (2/8)] (P < 0.05). And a negative correlation existed between the expression levels of E-cadherin and Vimentin
(r = −0.750, P < 0.01).
Conclusions: In the disease model we established in this study, we found pathological changes that met BO
characteristics happened in the transplanted lungs. Meanwhile, the small airway epithelial cells of transplanted lungs
underwent an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which indicated a role of EMT in the BO airway remodeling.

Background
Up to now, lung transplantation (LT) is the only effective
method in the treatment of terminal pulmonary disease,
but chronic dysfunction of transplanted lungs related to
chronic graft rejection limits the long-term effect of LT
[1]. The development of chronic lung allograft dysfunc￾tion (CLAD), with the Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO)
being the most common manifestation, is considered to
be a major player in the process of chronic graft failure
and the most frequent cause of long-term morbidity and
mortality after LT [2, 3]. As a process of chronic airway
rejection, BO is manifested in the fibroplasia and occlu￾sion of small airway, leading to persistent decline of lung
function. Approximately 68% of lung transplant patients
showed varying degrees of BO within 3 months after
surgery [4]. The structural alteration of the terminal
bronchioles is a main cause of the airway obstruction in
the process of BO [5]. Since the principal pathological
change of BO is airway remodeling, inhibition of which
could be the key of future clinical management of post￾lung transplantation BO.
EMT refers to a process that epithelial cells lose their
original epithelial features and obtain some mesenchymal * Correspondence: dr_hujian@zju.edu.cn

characteristics, such as losing cell adhesion, gaining the
ability to migrate and extending to a spindle shape similar
to fibroblasts in morphology. Then the epithelial cells
stretch out pseudopodia, separate themselves from the
surrounding cells, break through the basement membrane
and become new mesenchymal cells [6, 7]. In terms of
surface markers, EMT is characterized by lost expression
of E-cadherin, decreased expression of epithelial markers,
and increased expression of mesenchymal markers such
as Vimentin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) in cells [8].
E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell surface protein,
which can promote the adhesion between the epithelial
cells, is the main protein to anchor the adhesion junction
between epithelial cells. The expression of E-cadherin
decreases in the process of embryonic development, tissue
fibrosis and cancer [9]. On the contrary, Vimentin, which
is only found in mesenchymal cells, is a kind of intermedi￾ate filament protein, attached to nucleus, endoplasmic
reticulum, and the sides or end of mitochondrion, making
great contribution to support and anchor organelles in the
protoplasm and playing an important role in the cell shape
maintenance. [10]. Current studies have showed that
EMT is involved in the BO airway remodeling [11, 12].
Thus, further exploration of the mechanism and patho￾logical significance of EMT may provide novel targets for
treatment of post-lung transplantation bronchiolitis
obliterans.
In the present study, a left lung orthotopic transplant￾ation model was successfully established in rats. We
then further explored the histological structure changes
in BO and detected the expression levels of the several
essential EMT markers. We found EMT took part in the
process of airway remodeling in the post-lung trans￾plantation BO, which provided a potential target for the
future treatment of BO after the lung transplantation
surgery.
Methods
Both male and female healthy SPF (specific pathogen free)
F344 and Lewis rats, weighted 200-250 g, were included
as the donors and recipients of the lung transplantation
surgery. The weight of the donor and the corresponding
recipient was controlled as close as possible. The rats were
all fed in SPF environment. Temperature of the animal
room was 20–22 °C and photoperiod was 12 h. The rats
adapted themselves to the environment for a week before
the experiments, drinking and eating freely. The ones with
normal behavior and showed no adverse reactions were
included in the surgery. The rats were divided into 2
groups. F344 rats with sham operations were grouped as
normal control and Lewis rats received allogeneic left lung
orthotopic transplantation [F344-to-Lewis] were grouped
as the experimental group.
We established the allogeneic lung transplantation
model. F344 rats (donors) with intraperitoneal injection
of atropine 0.25 mg were anesthetized with intraperito￾neal injection of chloral hydrate (10 vol%) 4 ml/kg, and
connected to a small animal ventilator after the tracheal
intubation. Then abdominal median incisions were made
and the rats were injected with heparin 1000 U/kg via
inferior vena cava. Next we cut open the diaphragm and
the anterior chest wall to sufficiently expose the cardio￾pulmonary tissues. The lung lavage was performed using
4 °C improved Euro-Collins solution and the perfusion
continued until the lung tissues were pale and the per￾fusates were clear and translucent. Then we separated
the left lung hilum, sheared off the left pulmonary artery,
left pulmonary vein and left bronchus, and fixed a can￾nula to each broken end by ligation. The donor lungs
were preserved in 4 °C improved Euro-Collins solution
and set aside.
Lewis rats (recipients) received the same operations of
anesthesia, intubation and ventilation surgery as the
donor rats. We got into the chest via an incision in the
left fourth intercostal space and separated the hilum.
Then we clamped the pulmonary artery and pulmonary
vein by microvascular clamp and sheared them off from
the distal end. Next, the pulmonary artery and pulmon￾ary vein of the donor lung were inserted into the corre￾sponding vessels of the recipient and fixed by ligation.
Afterwards the vein and artery were opened in sequence.
Then we clamped the bronchus, sheared it off from the
distal end, removed the original lung and put the donor
lung into the original position in the thoracic cavity.
After that we inserted the bronchus of the donor lung
into the corresponding broken end and fixed it by
ligation. Finally the lung was ventilated to recover. The
criterions of successful anastomosis: (1) no blood or air
leaking from the three anastomotic stomas; (2) the pul￾monary artery and pulmonary vein were both filled; (3)
the lung presented as pink, uniform and elastic. Finally
we put into the thoracic drainage tube and performed
sternal closure and anesthesia recovery.
We randomly chose healthy F344 rats to perform
sham operation, which only included the thoracotomy
and sternal closure surgery while the lung transplant￾ation was not performed. The operation of anesthesia,
intubation, ventilation, incision cutting, sternal closure
and anesthesia recovery were all the same as that of the
recipients described previously.
Next, we established the BO model [13]. From the first
day after the surgery, the rats from experimental group
were given intraperitoneal injection of cyclosporine
(5 mg/kg•d) for 10 days in order to reduce the acute
rejection. At the 28th day after the surgery, the rats from
experimental group were given intratracheal administra￾tion with lipopolysaccharide (0.5 mg/kg) while the
Zhang et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017) 12:119 Page 2 of 6

treatment of the control group was intratracheal adminis￾tration of PBS at the 28th day after the sham operation.
The rats from both control and experimental group
were killed at the 90th day after the surgery and their left
lungs were taken out and fixed by 10% Formalin. The par￾affin sections of the samples were made and examined by
HE staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry.
Following dewaxing and hydration according to the
normal protocols, HE staining and Masson staining were
performed. After mounting, the histological structure
was observed and the differences between experimental
group and control group were compared.
Streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) was used to perform the
examination. Paraffin embedded sections with normal
dehydration were performed antigen retrieval. The pri￾mary antibodies (Vimentin and E-cadherin), secondary
antibody (mouse anti-rabbit IgG) and SP complex were
dropwise added in sequence. Then we examined the ex￾pression levels of Vimentin and E-cadherin after 30 min
incubation in 37 °C incubator. In 5 high power fields of
each section, two experienced researchers independently
analyzed and evaluated the levels of positive expression
rates of Vimentin and E-cadherin, which were consid￾ered as yellow or brown granules appeared in the cells.
The staining results were analyzed with staining inten￾sity and positive cell number both taken into consider￾ation. Immunoreactive score (IRS) was calculated by
SI × PP. SI stands for staining intensity: 0 for no color, 1
for light yellow, 2 for brown, and 3 for dark brown. PP
stands for the percentage of positive cells: 0 for no posi￾tive cells, 1 for less than 10%, 2 for 10 to 50%, 3 for 50
to 75%, and 4 for more than 75%. We set IRS ≤ 3 for
negative and IRS > 3 for positive. Finally, the qualitative re￾sults of immunohistochemistry were determined by the
overall conditions of the five random fields: Vimentin (+),
Vimentin (−), E-cadherin (+), E-cadherin (−).
All of the experiment data were analyzed using SPSS
20 software. The analysis of enumeration data was per￾formed using Fisher’s Exact test and the Spearman’s rank
correlation was for the correlation analysis. P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
There were 13 rats for the successful modeling of ex￾perimental group and 8 sham-operated F344 rats for the
control group. The HE staining results of tissue sections
of healthy lungs and transplanted lungs were shown in
Fig. 1. In the sections of healthy lungs, the wall of bron￾chiole had longitudinal plicae and were covered by pseu￾dostratified ciliated columnar epithelium; there were no
significant abnormality or just mild inflammatory cell
infiltration that can be seen in histomorphology. On the
contrary, the sections of transplanted lungs showed
obviously abnormal bronchiole epithelium, which had
hypertrophic mucosa and clear plicae. Peripheral inflam￾matory cell infiltration, stroma deposition and hyperpla￾sia of fibrous tissue were found in submucosa. It was
also visible for lamellar inflammatory exudate or even
granulation tissues in the bronchiole lumen; and the
lumen also had stenosis at different levels.
The Masson staining sections of healthy and trans￾planted lung tissues were shown in Fig. 2. In the healthy
lung tissue sections, the muscularis of bronchiole tunica
media was thin and the smooth muscle was arranged in
an undivided circle. However in the transplanted lung
tissue sections, the muscularis of bronchiole tunica
media became thick and the arrangement of smooth
muscle was disordered. From there evident hyperplasia
of fibrous tissue was also found.
The immunohistochemistry results of E-cadherin and
Vimentin expression were shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The
overall qualitative result of 21 rats’ lung tissue specimens
illustrated that there were 38.50% (5/13) of lung
transplanted rats showed a positive expression of E￾cadherin while it was 87.50% (7/8) of that in the healthy
ones; and the difference between two groups was signifi￾cant (P < 0.05). As for Vimentin, the positive expression
rate of transplanted lung tissue sections was 76.92% (10/
13) while in the healthy lung tissues it was 25.00% (2/8)
and the significant difference existed between the two
groups as well (P < 0.05). Spearman’s rank correlation

specimens demonstrated a negative correlation between

Discussion
Lung transplantation (LT) is the only effective method in
the treatment of terminal pulmonary disease, but the
chronic dysfunction of transplanted lung remains to be a
problem waiting to be solved with great urgency. Accord￾ing to its clinical manifestation and pathological character￾istics, current studies believe that the chronic dysfunction
is closely related to the self-inflammatory process, includ￾ing bronchiolitis obliterans, chronic vascular rejection,
post-transplantation large airway inflammation, chronic
bronchiolitis, chronic lung stroma fibrosis and chronic
pleurisy [14]. Among all of these, our study mainly
discussed about the post-transplantation bronchiolitis
obliterans.
Bronchiolitis obliterans is a chronic airway disease which
mainly manifests as infiltration of airway neutrophils and
macrophages. Conditions like oxidative stress and the im￾balance of protease and antiprotease can lead to the release
of many inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α、IL￾6、IL-8、IL-1. The inflammatory mediators finally causes
airway mucus hypersecretion, airway smooth muscle hyper￾trophy, increased collagen synthesis and hyperplasia of air￾way microvessels, namely the airway remodeling. Airway
remodeling is the key pathological change in the process of
lung function decline caused by BO. In the transplanted
lungs we found evidently abnormal bronchiole epithelium,
which had hypertrophic mucosa and clear plicae. Peripheral
inflammatory cell infiltration, stroma deposition and hyper￾plasia of fibrous tissue were found in submucosa. It was
also visible for lamellar inflammatory exudate or even
granulation tissue in the bronchiole lumen; and the lumen
also had stenosis at different levels. These are the character￾istics of airway remodeling and in accordance with
pathological changes of BO. Therefore, we successfully
established the model of post-lung transplantation BO.

In addition, we also explored the correlation between
EMT and the airway remodeling. At present, many stud￾ies have demonstrated that EMT is associated with air￾way epithelial remodeling [15–17]. By observing a
mouse asthma model, Johnson et al. [16] have found
absence of E-cadherin expression, appearance of mesen￾chymal related indicators and thickening of smooth
muscle in mouse airway epithelial cells after a 15-week
exposure of dust mites. This work illustrated that EMT
was involved in the process of asthma airway remodel￾ing. The study of Sohal et al. [17] also demonstrated a
close correlation between EMT and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) airway remodeling. They
found that cells in the cracks of basement membrane of
COPD group expressed the mesenchymal cell markers
such as S100A4, Vimentin and MMP9. Further immuno￾histochemistry analysis showed that there were corres￾pondingly 13.8% and 7% of COPD sufferers’ basement
epithelial cells and cells in reticular basement membrane
simultaneously expressing keratin and S100A4, which
means that EMT existed in the airway of COPD
sufferers. Our immunohistochemistry results showed
decreased E-cadherin expression and significantly in￾creased Vimentin expression in transplanted lungs com￾pared to normal lung tissues, which means an EMT
process happened. Thus, the airway remodeling after
lung transplantation is also related to EMT.
In our study, we noted that the BO pathological
changes happened along with EMT in transplanted lung
tissues, which testified EMT was involved in the small
airway remodeling of BO. Inevitably, this study has a few
limitations. The most important point among these is
the relatively small sample size. In consideration of the
complexity of the development and progress of BO after
lung transplantation, small sample of a rat model has its
natural drawbacks to present full understanding of such
a huge issue. Secondly, although we tried to ensure that
the experimental animal characteristics and the experi￾mental conditions are similar, some common factors in
animal model, such as various pathophysiological mech￾anisms, different responses to drugs, variations induced
by techniques, differences in genetic regulation and
anatomical differences, might have potential effects on
this disease model. In addition, adding a Lewis to Lewis
transplantation group as another control group would
increase the reliability of the conclusions. Besides, it is
also a pity that we still can’t identify the exact position
of EMT in BO though they are existing simultaneously.
We still don’t know whether that EMT is one of the
causes of BO or it is only an accompanying phenomenon
in the process of BO genesis and development. If EMT
promotes the genesis and development of BO, then sup￾pressing EMT may inhibit the progression of BO; while if
EMT is just an accompanying phenomenon in the process
of BO genesis and development, then further exploration
of the mechanism of EMT is needed for the potential
clues of post-lung transplantation BO.
Conclusions
Although there were still some deficiencies, we believe
that the established disease model in our study provided
convincing evidences to prove that EMT is involved in

the BO airway remodeling. However the role of EMT in
BO still remains unknown and the specific relations
between them is still remained to be explored. Further
study of the mechanism and pathological significance of
EMT in the transplanted lungs after lung transplantation
may reveal novel targets for the prevention and treatment
of post-lung transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans.
