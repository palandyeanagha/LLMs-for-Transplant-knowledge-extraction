Abstract
Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common
hereditary renal disease. The disease is caused by mutations of the PKD1 (affecting roughly 85% of
ADPKD patients) and PKD2 (affecting roughly 14% of ADPKD patients) genes, although in several
ADPKD families, the PKD1 and/or PKD2 linkage was not found. Mutation analysis of the PKD1 gene
is complicated by the presence of highly homologous genomic duplications of the first two thirds
of the gene.
Methods: The direct detection of mutations in the non-duplicated region of the PKD1 gene was
performed in 90 unrelated individuals, consisting of 58 patients with end-stage renal failure
(manifesting before their 50th year of life) and 32 individuals from families where the disease was
clearly linked to the PKD1 gene. Mutation screening was performed using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE). DNA fragments showing an aberrant electrophoretic banding pattern
were sequenced.
Results: In the non-duplicated region of the PKD1 gene, 19 different likely pathogenic germline
sequence changes were identified in 19 unrelated families/individuals. Fifteen likely pathogenic
sequence changes are unique for the Czech population. The following probable mutations were
identified: 9 nonsense mutations, 6 likely pathogenic missense mutations, 2 frameshifting mutations,
one in-frame deletion and probable splice site mutation. In the non-duplicated region of the PKD1
gene, 16 different polymorphisms or unclassified variants were detected.
Conclusion: Twenty probable mutations of the PKD1 gene in 90 Czech individuals (fifteen new
probable mutations) were detected. The establishment of localization and the type of causal
mutations and their genotype phenotype correlation in ADPKD families will improve DNA
diagnosis and could help in the assessment of the clinical prognosis of ADPKD patients.

Background
ADPKD is the most frequently inherited renal cystic disor￾der with an incidence between 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 [1].
ADPKD is a systemic disorder with cysts and connective
tissue abnormalities involving many organs [2]. The pro￾gressive formation and enlargement of renal cysts causes
the decline in renal function.
The disease is genetically heterogeneous. At least three dif￾ferent genes are involved. The PKD1 locus (MIM 601313)
is linked to the short arm of chromosome 16, at 16p13.3
[3,4]; and so far, 818 different sequence variants have
been reported in Polycystic Kidney Disease Mutation
Database (PKDB) [5]. Later, a second locus PKD2 (MIM
173910) was located on chromosome 4q21 [6]; and 123
different sequence variants have been reported in PKDB
[5]. Families with ADPKD unlinked to the PKD1 or PKD2
loci have also been described [7], but the predicted PKD3
locus (MIM 600666) has not been mapped yet. Eighty￾five percent of ADPKD cases are caused by a mutation of
the PKD1 gene on chromosome 16 and in about 15% of
all cases, the PKD2 gene on chromosome 4 is mutated [8].
When PKD2 patients are compared to PKD1 patients, they
seem to have a milder clinical presentation. The average
age of PKD1 patients at end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is
54.3 years compared with 74.0 years for PKD2 patients
[9].
The PKD1 gene consists of 46 exons from which a 14.1 kb
transcript is produced. The 4303-aminoacid product of
PKD1 is called polycystin-1. The PKD2 gene consists of 15
exons. The 5.4 kb PKD2 transcript encodes the protein
polycystin-2, which consists of 968 amino acids. Polycys￾tin-2 is a TRP (transient receptor potential) ion channel,
which is involved in regulation of intracellular Ca2+ con￾centration [10]. The cytoplasmic COOH terminus of poly￾cystin-2 interacts with the coiled-coil region of polycystin￾1 [11,12]. Both polycystins, similarly to other cystogenic
proteins, have been localized to primary cilia [13]. This
complex may act as a flow-dependent mechanosensor
that regulates the differentiated state of tubular epithelial
cells [14].
ADPKD is the disease with variable clinical course not
only among families with different mutations, but within
families with a defined mutation as well. Different muta￾tions in PKD genes may have different effects on the clin￾ical course of the disease. The genotype-phenotype
correlation of 80 families revealed earlier ESRD (49 years
versus 54 years) for mutations in the 5'region of the PKD1
gene (to exon 19, nucleotide 7812) in comparison with
mutations in the 3'region [15]. Very early onset of the
ESRD has been described in families with mutations in
exons 15 and 41 of the PKD1 gene [16,17]. As for PKD2
patients, those mutations at the 3'end of the PKD2 gene
result in a milder clinical course; however there is no clear
correlation between the age of onset of ESRD and the loca￾tion or the type of mutation [18]. The majority of PKD1
and PKD2 mutations are unique to a single family, recur￾rent mutations account only for 30% of the total. Detec￾tion levels are from 60 to 70% [19]. In this study, the non￾duplicated region of the PKD1 gene in 90 unrelated Czech
individuals was screened.
Methods
Patients
The coding sequences of the non-duplicated region of the
PKD1 gene in 90 unrelated Czech patients with ADPKD
were screened. The study was performed with the
approval of the Ethics Committee of the General Teaching
Hospital in Prague. Informed consent was obtained from
each patient before genetic testing. Fifty-eight ADPKD
patients (hemodialysis-HD 158) from dialysis centres in
the Czech Republic, from the Transplantation Centre in
Prague and from the Department of Nephrology of the
General University Hospital in Prague were selected. This
group (34 males, 24 females) that reached ESRD were all
aged between 33 and 50 (average age at onset of ESRD is
44.5 ± 4.8 years). Other 32 unrelated patients (18 males,
14 females) with ADPKD clearly linked to the PKD1 gene,
according to the linkage analysis in Czech families, were
selected (data not shown).
Asymptomatic at-risk individuals were examined by ultra￾sound. The positive diagnosis of ADPKD was based upon
the criteria described by Ravine [20]. In most patients, the
onset of arterial hypertension was established retrospec￾tively. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure
higher than 140/90 mmHg (repeatedly measured) or a
normal blood pressure maintained by the use of antihy￾pertensive drugs.
Mutational screening
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lym￾phocytes by the salting-out procedure [21]. The coding
region and intron-exon boundaries of the non-duplicated
region of the PKD1 gene were screened for mutations
using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE).
Exons 34 46 were amplified using the set of GC-clamped
primers. Sequences of primers, PCR and DGGE condi￾tions are described in detail by Perrichot et al. [22]. All
PCR fragments showing an aberrant electrophoretic band￾ing pattern on DGGE were sequenced in both directions
using an automatic fluorescent genetic analyzer (ABI
Prism™ 310 Genetic Analyzer; PE Applied Biosystems) in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To prove
the segregation of the potential mutation with the disease
in the family, the DNAs of all available members of the
concrete family were analyzed using DGGE (Figure 1a)
and/or sequencing.

In the case of not-yet described missense mutations, 200
healthy individuals were tested for the presence of this
potential mutation. This test was performed by restriction
analysis (in case that the restriction site is created or abol￾ished as a consequence of the found sequence change),
high resolution melting analysis (HRM; LightCycler® 480
Roche instrumentation) or SNaPshot™ Multiplex Kit (ABI
PRISM310 instrumentation) according to the manufac￾turer's instructions.
Data analysis
Putative missense changes in PKD1 gene were analyzed
for their site conservation in protein sequences BLAST
[23]. Multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences
and the graphic view of the alignment were performed
using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Figure 2) [24].
The position of a resultant amino acid change within
polycystin-1 was determined at UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
entry P98161[25].
Results and discussion
Twenty (19 different) germline likely pathogenic
sequence changes in 90 unrelated patients were identified
by mutation analysis of the coding non-duplicated region
of the PKD1 gene (Table 1). In one individual, two differ￾ent likely pathogenic sequence changes were detected.
Overall detection rate was 21.1% (19 out of 90 unrelated
Czech patients), which is relatively high level considering
that only non-duplicated region of the gene was screened.
The high detection level of putative mutations confirms
that DGGE is a reliable and sensitive (but time consum￾ing) method for screening of mutations. It allows the res￾olution of relatively large DNA fragments, up to 500 bp. It
is also capable to detect up to 100% of all single base sub￾stitutions. It has been shown to be more sensitive than
many other commonly used mutation detection methods,
including single strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis [26]. DGGE has a
number of limitations, including the use of specialized
equipment, the addition of GC clamps (that makes the
purchase of PCR primers expensive) and the knowledge of
melting behavior for an efficient analysis.
Fifteen new likely pathogenic sequence changes in Czech
population were identified. Twelve likely pathogenic
sequence changes in 11 patients from 58 individuals
(19.0%), who had reached ESRD before the age of 50
years, were found. Eight putative mutations in 32 families
(25.0%) with clear linkage to the PKD1 gene were identi￾fied. Ten nonsense mutations (50.0%), six likely missense
mutations (30.0%), two frameshifting mutations
(10.0%), one in-frame deletion (5.0%) and one putative
splice site mutation (5.0%) were identified in total. In the
non-duplicated region of the PKD1 gene, sixteen different
polymorphisms were also described (Table 2).
Clinical characteristics of patients/probands with an iden￾tified putative mutation are summarized in Table 3.
Nonsense mutations in the PKD1 gene were the most fre￾quent sequence changes in our patients. They were
detected in 50.0% of affected individuals. Two short dele￾tions in two patients (HD 2, HD 41) and one insertion/
duplication (HD 12) were detected. Truncating mutations
were found in 70.0% of cases (including in-frame dele￾tion and putative splice site mutation), which is in con￾cordance with previous reports using other methods of
detection, such as DHPLC or direct sequencing [19].
The nonsense mutation p.R4021X was found in two unre￾lated Czech patients (fam. 281, HD 31). This nonsense
mutation was frequently detected in other studies [19,27].
These C → T change in CpG dinucleotides may be recur￾rent. Recurrent mutations account for 30% of affected
families and may simplify molecular diagnostics. The
clinical course was quite severe in both Czech families. All

family members from the hemodialyzed patient (HD 31),
who had renal failure at the age of 36 years, were exam￾ined. Four of his siblings had renal failure at the ages of
54, 40, 43, and 42 years. Two affected sisters from family
281 had renal failure at the age of 50 years with manifes￾tation and complications of the disease (such as severe
hypertension, urolithiasis and recurrent cyst infections)
from 30 years of age.
A short deletion of 6 bases c.11340_11345delTTACGA is
an in-frame putative mutation which ends in the absence
of two amino acids p.Y3781_D3782del (Figure 3a). The
proband already had ESRD at the age of 42 years. This
deletion is in the area of frequent mutations/polymor￾phisms (Figure 3). The deletion was not present in the 27
year-old son with normal ultrasound. The deletion was
present in the 29 year-old son who already suffered from
mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 150 μmol/l).
We would have predicted a milder clinical course in these
two patients with ADPKD; however, both of them did not
regularly use antihypertensive drugs and so did suffer
from severe hypertension.
The deletion of 22 bases c.11623_11645del22
(p.A3875PfsX62) in exon 42 was detected in the patient
with ESRD at the age of 44 years. This frameshift mutation
leads to the formation of 62 new amino acids and then to
a shorter protein.
The duplication of 8 bases c.11345dupGATTACGA
(p.D3782EfsX46) (Figure 3b) in exon 40 was identified in
the patient with ESRD at the age of 45 years. This change
is also in the area of frequent mutations/polymorphisms
(Figure 3). After 46 new amino acids, the protein is termi￾nated.
The substitution in intron 36 (c.10821+1G → C) in the
patient with ESRD at the age of 45 years (HD 15) was
identified. This change is located just in the conserved
donor splice site and will probably lead to an abnormal
splicing. No mRNA experiment was available in our labo￾ratory to confirm this hypothesis, but it has been well
demonstrated in other genes. The effect of this substitu￾tion could be predicted either as exon skipping (in this
case the skipping of exon 36) or frameshift [19,28]. This
probable splice site mutation in intron 36 was also found
in the 27 year-old son of the proband with enlarged cystic
kidneys upon ultrasound, but was missing in two other
sons of the proband (30 and 26 years-old) with normal
ultrasounds. The causality of this substitution is thus
highly probable. In addition, another substitution
c.11080C → T (p.C3694R) in exon 38 was identified in

the same family. The level of conservation of this missense
variant is relatively low, though it is conserved well in
mammals (Figure 2). Moreover, it segregates with the
affected individuals in the family and is not present in 200
unrelated healthy controls. This missense variant in exon
38 can eventually contribute to the expansion of the
severe clinical course of ADPDK as well and intensify the
negative effect of probable splice site mutation in intron
36 on the function of polycystin-1. We can thus only spec￾ulate, which of these two substitutions is really causative.
Together with the potential missense mutation c.11080C
→ T (p.C3694R) in exon 38, six putative missense muta￾tions in ADPKD patients (30.0% of all mutations) were
detected. The most important factor in determining
whether a missense change was likely pathogenic was the
degree to which the corresponding sequence of amino
acids was conserved. All missense variants segregated with
affected members within a family. Moreover, 200 unre￾lated healthy individuals were tested and no similar
changes were observed.

The putative missense mutation c.10850 T → C
(p.L3617P) in exon 37 was identified in the family 340.
This missense variant was present in the proband with
enlarged cystic kidneys, in his son (multiple cysts at the
age of 30 years) and in his daughter (two renal cysts at the
age of 10 years). Leucine (a neutral hydrophobic amino
acid) was changed to proline (which has an aliphatic side
chain unlike other amino acids). Leucine in this position
is conserved in all mammals, xenopus and trichoplax
studied (Figure 2).
The putative missense mutation c.11078 C → T (S3693L;
family 173) leads to the change of serine (a neutral
hydrophilic amino acid) into leucine (a neutral hydro￾phobic amino acid). Serine is conserved only in mammals
(Figure 2). This substitution was present in the proband
(normal serum creatinine at the age of 38 years, enlarged
cystic kidneys on ultrasound), in his mother (with ESRD
at the age of 55 years, severe hypertension) and in his 7
year-old daughter (two renal cysts on ultrasound). This
substitution was not present in the brother (normal ultra￾sound at the age of 40 years) and in the son (normal ultra￾sound at the age 12 year) of the proband.
The putative missense mutation c.11258 G → A
(p.R3753Q) in exon 39 was identified in the family 329.
Arginine (a basic amino acid) was changed to glutamine
(a neutral amino acid containing an amino and an amide
group). The grandfather of the proband had ESRD at the
age of 59 years, the 58 year-old female suffered from mod￾erate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 220 μmol/l).
The 32 year-old female was diagnosed by ultrasound at

the age of 8 years and suffered from severe hypertension
and from complicated renal infections. This putative mis￾sense mutation was described in another report [19].
The putative missense mutation c. 12648 A → C
(p.Q4216H) in exon 46 was identified in the family 237.
Glutamine (a neutral amino acid containing an amino
and an amide group) was changed to histidine (a basic
amino acid with an imidazole ring, which is frequently
found in the reactive centre of proteins). Glutamine in
this position was found in only a small portion of those
mammals that have been compared (Figure 2). The grand￾father of the female proband had ESRD at the age of 48
years; the mother of the proband started with hemodialy￾sis at the age of 42 years. However, sequence analysis of
this missense variant revealed that in some mammals,
such as Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus, histidine in
position 4216 is conserved. So, it remains unclear
whether this substitution is casual or a very rare sequence
change without a pathological manifestation.
The putative missense mutation c. 12683 G → C
(p.R4228P) in exon 46 was identified in the patient 38
from the hemodialysis center and is probably responsible

for ADPKD. Arginine (a basic amino acid) was changed to
proline (which has an aliphatic side chain unlike the
other amino acids). Arginine in this position is conserved
in a major part of those species that have been compared
(Figure 2).
Polycystin-1 is a complicated transmembrane protein,
whose structure has not been experimentally determined
yet. Thus, all reports are based only on a theoretical model
of polycystin-1. The model of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry
P98161 was used in our report [25].
Five mutations (p.R3753Q, p.Y3781_D3782del,
p.D3782EfsX46, p.W3806X, and p.A3875PfsX62) were
identified in the 202 amino acid long putative extracellu￾lar domain of polycystin-1. This extracellular domain is a
part of the polycystin cation channel (PRO13122;
AA37114113). This domain is supposed to be post-trans￾lationally modified by glycosylation. Additionally, the
following putative cytoplasmatic domain, formed by 27
amino acids, is a part of the polycystin cation channel as
well (PRO13122; AA37114113). Three mutations
(p.Q4011X [29], p.L4019X, p.R4021X [27]) were detected
in this intracellular domain of polycystin-1. The C termi￾nus of polycystin-1 harbors a coiled-coil domain that is
involved in the physical interaction with polycystin-2.
Together, they form functional polycystin complexes in
vivo. Three mutations (p.R4228P, p.Q4231X, and
p.Q4242X) were identified in this coiled-coil domain.
Conclusion
In conclusion, twenty putative mutations in the non￾duplicated part of the PKD1 gene in 90 Czech individuals
were detected. Fifteen of these putative mutations are
novel (unique in Czech population). Truncated muta￾tions, detected in 70% of the cases, were the most frequent
mutations.
