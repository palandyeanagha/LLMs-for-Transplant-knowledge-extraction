Identifying transplant recipients in whom immunological tolerance is established or is developing would
allow an individually tailored approach to their posttransplantation management. In this study, we aimed to
develop reliable and reproducible in vitro assays capable of detecting tolerance in renal transplant recipients.
Several biomarkers and bioassays were screened on a training setthatincluded 11 operationally tolerant renal
transplant recipients, recipient groups following different immunosuppressive regimes, recipients undergo￾ing chronic rejection, and healthy controls. Highly predictive assays were repeated on an independent test set
that included 24 tolerant renal transplant recipients. Tolerant patients displayed an expansion of peripheral
blood B and NK lymphocytes, fewer activated CD4+ T cells, a lack of donor-specific antibodies, donor-spe￾cific hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells, and a high ratio of forkhead box P3 to α-1,2-mannosidase gene
expression. Microarray analysis further revealed in tolerant recipients a bias toward differential expression of
B cell–related genes and their associated molecular pathways. By combining these indices of tolerance as a
cross-platform biomarker signature, we were able to identify tolerant recipients in both the training set and
the test set. This study provides an immunological profile of the tolerant state that, with further validation,
should inform and shape drug-weaning protocols in renal transplant recipients.
Introduction
Transplantation tolerance can be defined as the stable main￾tenance of good allograft function in the sustained absence 
of immunosuppressive therapy. In the clinical arena, it is only 
apparent when patients experience stable allograft function 
despite having ceased all immunosuppression for an extended 
period of time. This state, defined as operational tolerance, has 
rarely been reported in renal transplantation (1–5), being more 
common in liver transplantation (6, 7).
Long-term survival of kidney transplants currently depends on 
sustained drug-induced immunosuppression. However, this is 
accompanied by increased morbidity and mortality, mainly due to 
cardiovascular disease, opportunistic infection, and malignancy 
(8). Currently, we do not have the means to identify a priori 
those patients who are developing tolerance to their transplants 
and who would therefore benefit from partial or complete ces￾sation of immunosuppression. Hence, there is an increasing 
need to develop assays and identify biomarkers that would allow 
clinicians to safely minimize immunosuppression, based on a 
patient’s specific immunological profile.
We report on a multicenter study aimed at defining specific 
immunological characteristics that identify the tolerant state. We 
recruited renal transplant patients from distinct clinical groups 
from across Europe, focusing on operationally tolerant recipients, 
defined as stable renal transplant recipients that had ceased all 
immunosuppressive drugs for more than a year with no increase 
in serum creatinine (CRT; <10%) during the last 12 months (tol￾erant, drug-free [Tol-DF]). As control groups, we selected patients 
with stable renal function maintained on less than 10 mg/d predni￾sone as the only immunosuppressive agent (stable, low prednisone

[s-LP]); those who had never received calcineurin-based immuno￾suppression (stable, no calcineurin inhibitor [s-nCNI]); patients 
who were maintained on standard calcineurin inhibitor therapy 
(s-CNI); patients with biopsy-proven and immunologically driven 
chronic rejection (CR); and age- and sex-matched healthy controls 
(HCs). The tolerant cohort collected by the Indices of Tolerance 
(IOT) consortium in Europe was used as a training set of renal 
transplant patients on which a series of bioassays and biomarkers 
were screened for their ability to detect immunological parameters 
uniquely associated with the tolerant state. In this set we identified 
a tolerance signature comprising a set of 10 genes with significantly 
altered expression, elevated numbers of peripheral blood B and 
NK cells, diminished numbers of recently activated CD4+ T cells, 
donor-specific hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells, and a high ratio 
of FoxP3/α-1,2-mannosidase gene expression in peripheral blood, 
in relation to the other renal transplant comparator groups.
These findings were then validated on an independent test set of 
renal transplant recipients of similar clinical groups recruited by 
the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) in the United States.
This and the study by Newell et al. (9) are the first to our knowl￾edge in which cross-platform biomarkers have been used to analyze 
operational tolerance in kidney transplantation. Together, we have 
studied the largest cohort of tolerant renal transplant recipients 
to date, and although using different assays and platforms, both 
studies have identified a B cell signature associated with opera￾tional tolerance. Here, we describe a robust set of research tools 
that, when combined, can distinguish drug-free tolerant patients 
from other groups of renal transplant patients and healthy con￾trols with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. More impor￾tantly, cross-platform biomarker analysis highlights subjects with￾in stable renal transplant groups who display an immunological 
profile similar to that of tolerant patients and who may therefore 
benefit from managed drug withdrawal.
Results
Tolerant renal transplant patient demographics. The training set com￾prised 71 European kidney transplant recipients and 19 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls (Table 1). The Tol-DF group had a 
high percentage of cadaveric donors (7 of 11), a high degree of HLA 
mismatching (median mismatches, 4.0), was predominantly male 
(9 of 11), and had varied causes of end-stage renal failure and some 
evidence of sensitizing events, such as blood transfusions and pre￾vious transplants (Table 2). These patients had relatively unevent￾ful post-transplantation courses, with only 1 patient having a 
documented episode of acute cellular rejection (ACR). The period 
of being immunosuppression-free varied from 1 to 21 years.
The Tol-DF group of the test set (Table 3) consisted of 24 
patients, most of whom had received their transplant from a 
highly HLA-matched living donor (median mismatches, 0.0) and 
had ceased taking all immunosuppression medication for periods 
from 1 to 32 years.
Tol-DF recipients displayed increased numbers of B and NK lymphocytes. 
As shown in Figure 1, Tol-DF patients of the training set displayed 
an increased percentages of peripheral blood B and NK cells and 
a corresponding decrease in the percentage of T cells. When the 
percentages of B cells and T cells were expressed as a ratio, Tol￾DF patients displayed the highest ratio compared with all other 
study groups, including HCs. For 6 Tol-DF patients and 10 s-CNI 
patients, it was also possible to calculate the absolute number of 
cells per lymphocyte subset. This showed that the altered ratio was

due to an expansion in B and NK cell numbers and 
not a reduction in T cell numbers, as none of the 
Tol-DF group were lymphopenic (Table 2).
In line with our findings in the training set, Tol￾DF patients of the test set also showed elevated per￾centages of peripheral blood B cells and a higher 
ratio of B/T cell percentages (Figures 1, E and H) 
compared with all other groups except HCs.
Given the distinct increase in peripheral blood 
B cells detected in Tol-DF patients, B cell subsets 
were analyzed (Supplemental Figure 1; supple￾mental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI39922DS1) and cytokine produc￾tion (Supplemental Figure 2) assessed in selected 
patients of both study sets. The Tol-DF group dis￾played a trend toward redistribution of B cell sub￾sets, with a decreased memory pool and concomi￾tant increase in transitional and naive B cell subsets. 
When the percentages of B cell subsets were exam￾ined as a ratio, Tol-DF patients were found to have a 
significantly lower proportion of memory and high￾er proportion of transitional B cells compared with 
CR patients. A significant proportion of B cells from 
Tol-DF patients was found to produce TGF-β upon 
in vitro stimulation, rather than IL-10 or IFN-γ. 
However, no significant differences in production 
of IL-10 were detected for any study group. The 
capacity of B cells from each patient group to pro￾duce either cytokine on stimulation was analyzed by 
calculating the ratio of the number of B cells pro￾ducing each cytokine. This suggested that B cells of 
Tol-DF patients had a skewed cytokine response, 
with a higher propensity for TGF-β production than 
B cells from other study groups.
Tolerant recipients had fewer activated CD4+ T cells 
in peripheral blood. Expression of CD25 by CD4+
T cells was analyzed as described in Methods. 
Tol-DF patients in the training set were found to 
have significantly lower percentages of circulating 
CD4+CD25int T cells, broadly thought of as activated 
T cells (10, 11) (Figure 2A), compared with the HC, 
s-LP, s-nCNI, and CR groups. Interestingly, no signif￾icant differences in the percentages of CD4+CD25hi
Tregs were detected among the study groups (Fig￾ure 2B). Similar results were also found in the test 
set, with Tol-DF patients having significantly lower 
percentages of CD4+CD25int T cells compared with 
s-CNI and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) 
groups, but again no differences in the percentages 
of CD4+CD25hi Tregs were detected between Tol￾DF and any other study group (Figure 2, C and D). 
Statistical comparisons between other groups of the 
training and test sets are shown in Supplemental 
Table 1, A and B, respectively.
When we tested the ability of enriched CD4+CD25hi
T cells to suppress autologous T cell proliferation 
induced by polyclonal stimulation, no significant 
differences were found between any of the patient 
groups or HCs (data not shown). Furthermore, Tol￾DF patients did not display higher percentages of

other Treg subsets such as CD3+CD8+CD28– or CD3+CD4–CD8–
T cells (data not shown).
The majority of tolerant recipients did not have detectable anti-donor 
HLA-specific antibodies. Serum non-donor-specific antibodies 
(NDSAs) were detectable in some patients from all study groups of 
the training set (Figure 3A) by Luminex xMAP analysis. Within this 
cohort, no Tol-DF patients had detectable donor-specific antibod￾ies (DSAs), whereas all other groups had some patients with detect￾able DSAs, with almost half of the CR patients having detectable 
levels of both donor- and non-donor-specific anti–HLA class I and 
class II antibodies. Similar to the training set, only 1 of 22 Tol-DF 
patients within the test set had detectable DSAs (data not shown). 
Interestingly, in general, graft function was worse in DSA-positive 
patients than DSA-negative patients, with an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) of 31 (range, 17–87) in DSA-positive patients 
compared with 60 (range, 13–94) in DSA-negative patients.
The possible pathogenicity of detected anti-donor antibodies was 
tested in the training set (Figure 3B). In 7 of 20 patients with anti–
class I antibodies and 4 of 13 patients with anti–class II antibodies, we 
found complement-fixing isotypes (IgG1 and IgG3); the remaining 
positive cases were exclusively of non-complement-fixing isotypes.
Detection of non-donor-specific anti–class I and anti–class II anti￾bodies was significantly associated with having received a previous 
transplant and having detectable panel reactive antibodies before 
transplant (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05), but not with previous preg￾nancies, blood transfusions, graft dysfunction, or episodes of ACR. 
In contrast, donor-specific anti–class II antibodies were associated 
with previous episodes of ACR and the number of HLA mismatches 
between donor and recipient (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05).
Tolerant patients have lower frequencies of direct pathway anti-donor 
IFN-γ CD4+ T cell responses. Comparison of direct pathway CD4+
T cell anti-donor and anti–third party (equally mismatched to 
donor) responses was assessed by IFN-γ ELISpot. Tol-DF patients 
had significantly higher ratios of responder anti-donor/anti–third 
party frequencies, indicating donor-specific hyporesponsiveness, 
compared with all other stable patient groups within the training 
set (Figure 4A; individual responder frequencies against donor and 
third party are shown in Supplemental Figure 3). Donor-specific 
hyporesponsiveness was not mediated by Tregs, as depletion of 
CD25+ cells from responder T cells did not result in an increase in 
responder frequencies (data not shown).
As patients within the Tol-DF group of the test set were fre￾quently completely HLA matched with their donors, anti-donor 
and anti–third party IFN-γ responses were generally very low 
(responder frequencies, >1:200,000). Despite this, the trend in anti￾donor responses in this Tol-DF group was generally reproduced, 
although a significant difference compared with other groups was 
not detected (Figure 4B).
Tolerant recipients displayed a higher ratio of expression of FoxP3 to 
α-1,2-mannosidase genes in peripheral blood. Whole blood gene expres￾sion levels of FoxP3 and α-1,2-mannosidase, both of which have 
been shown to correlate with anti-donor immune reactivity after 
transplantation (12), were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT￾PCR) (Supplemental Figure 4). When calculating the ratio of 
FoxP3 to α-1,2-mannosidase expression, a significant difference 
was detected between Tol-DF and the CR and HC groups of the 
training set (Figure 5A). The patient groups displaying the highest 
ratio were HC, s-LP, and Tol-DF, whereas the ratio was dramati￾cally lower in CR patients (Mann-Whitney U test P values for com￾parisons between groups other than Tol-DF of the training and 
test sets are shown in Supplemental Table 2, A and B, respectively). 
This ratio significantly correlated with eGFR and inversely corre￾lated with serum CRT (Pearson coefficients: 0.372, P = 0.002, and 
–0.299, P = 0.014, respectively; data not shown).
When the same analysis was performed on the test set, the ratio 
in Tol-DF patients was significantly higher than in all other patient 
groups except HCs (Figure 5B). Combining the training and test 
set observations shows that tolerance is associated with a high 
ratio of peripheral blood FoxP3 to α-1,2-mannosidase expression.
Tolerant patients exhibited a distinct gene expression profile. The RISET 
2.0 custom microarray, designed with a focus on transplantation 
research, was assembled by the inclusion of 5,069 probes and used 
to analyze the expression of 4,607 genes (valid Entrez Gene ID) in 
peripheral blood samples.
A 4-class analysis of microarray data was performed on the 
training set (Figure 6). Significantly altered gene expression 
detected between Tol-DF patients and other comparator groups, 
stable recipients (s-CNI, s-nCNI, and s-LP), CR patients, and 
HCs, was statistically determined using the Kruskal-Wallis non￾parametric test with adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR) 
at 1% (13). The HC group was included in this analysis in order 
to address the lack of immune suppression in Tol-DF patients 
compared with the other study groups. Two hundred and sixty 
probes, corresponding to 255 genes, were identified as being 
significantly differentially expressed between the study groups 
(Supplemental Table 3A; median fold changes in gene expres￾sion for each patient group are shown in Supplemental Figure 
5A). When a similar analysis was performed on the test set, 1,378 
probes, corresponding to 1,352 genes, with significantly altered 
expression were identified (Supplemental Table 3B and Supple￾Table 3

mental Figure 5B), with 174 probes (170 genes) found to be com￾mon between the training and test sets (Supplemental Table 4). 
Median probe expression values for the top-ranked probes are 
shown in Supplemental Table 5.
Gene expression detected by microarray was reproducible by qRT-PCR. 
Differential gene expression detected by microarray analysis was 
further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of several probes that were 
highly ranked within the list and were a combination of probes 
detected to be either down- or upregulated. Expression of all the 
genes was highly correlated using both assays (Supplemental Fig￾ure 6, A–E), and qRT-PCR–quantitated expression of the selected 
genes was significantly different compared with expression in at 
least one of the other patient groups, depending on the gene stud￾ied (Supplemental Figure 6, F–J). Interestingly, the median expres￾sion levels in Tol-DF patient samples for all selected genes was very 
similar in the training and test sets, although due to the higher 
sample number in the test set, their correlation coefficients were 
generally higher (Supplemental Figure 7, A–E). Furthermore, gene 
expression in Tol-DF patients was significantly different compared 
with that in most of the other groups for 4 of 5 genes tested 
(Supplemental Figures 6 and 7, F–J).
Gene expression diagnostic capabilities. For a more precise 
quantitative approach to gene expression analysis, with the 
utility to distinguish tolerant from non-tolerant individuals, 
we employed the top-ranked genes identified by microarray 
analysis, excluding any overlapping probes for any single gene 
(e.g., TCLA-1 ranked 2 and 4, excluding probe ranked 4), in 
an additive binary regression model to build receiver oper￾ating characteristic (ROC) curves. These probes were used 
to build a gene expression signature to specifically identify 
Tol-DF patients by first producing predicted classes (within￾sample) and hence a classification for each individual.
For this analysis, 2-class ROC curves (tolerant versus non￾tolerant) were built by both including and excluding the HC 
group from the nontolerant comparator groups. This was 
done because while the comparison of HCs with tolerant 
individuals is of interest in identifying tolerance-specific 
gene expression, in the context of developing a clinical diag￾nostic test for tolerance in renal transplant patients, this 
comparison is not useful.
The corresponding ROC curve built excluding HCs (Figure 
7A) and based on the expression of the top 10 ranked genes 
(Table 4) delivered a peak specificity and sensitivity of 1, with 
a threshold of 0.01, and corresponding positive predictive 
and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) of 100% 
within the training set (ROC including HC: threshold 0.2, specificity 
0.853, sensitivity 0.923). Although 6 genes were sufficient to deliver 
good discrimination of tolerant patients within the training set, 
the top 10 ranked genes were selected for use, as they improved the 
specificity and sensitivity of subsequent ROC analysis of the test set 
(Figure 7B). Within sample analysis of the test set delivered a peak 
specificity of 0.890 and sensitivity of 0.806, with a threshold of 0.35, 
and PPV and NPV of 71% and 93%, respectively (ROC including 
HCs: threshold 0.23, specificity 0.801, sensitivity 0.806).
Annotation enrichment analyses on significant genes coincide between 
the training set and the test set. To identify significant associations 
of tolerance-related genes with any specific molecular pathway 
screened by microarray, we performed annotation enrichment 
analyses on the set of 174 overlapping probes identified between

genes, 6 genes are described to be expressed by B cells or related to 
B cell function (Table 4). This generalized B cell signature of toler￾ance is also cross-validated by Newell et al. (9). In addition to the 
B cell–related pathways enriched within this probe list, other path￾ways were also significantly regulated, including those involving 
protein tyrosine kinases and generation of secondary signaling 
messenger molecules as well as other T cell activation–related 
pathways (Supplemental Table 6).
Cross-platform biomarker diagnostic capabilities. All assays described 
in Methods section were tested in parallel for their diagnostic abil￾ity to distinguish Tol-DF patients from all other study groups. 
Assays performed on the test set were those that were highly pre￾dictive of tolerance within the training set and are shown above. 
By combining bioassays and biomarkers that indicate the pres￾ence of tolerance, we would expect that by using a cross-platform 
approach, we can significantly improve the diagnostic ability of 
any such individual test. This was indeed observed for the test set.
Indeed, when biomarkers and microarray data were analyzed in 
combination, using (a) the ratio of B to T lymphocyte subsets, (b) 
the percentage of CD4+CD25int T cells, (c) the ratio of anti-donor to 
anti–third party ELISpot frequencies, (d) the ratio of FoxP3 to α-1,2-
mannosidase expression, and (e) a signature of the top 10 ranked 
genes, the specificity and sensitivity for the training set was 1, with a 
threshold of 0.01, which implied PPV and NPV of 100% (Figure 8A).
When analyzing the test set, a peak specificity of 0.923 and a 
sensitivity of 0.903 were obtained, with a threshold of 0.27, and 
a corresponding PPV of 80%, and NPV of 96% (Figure 8B), which 
improved the diagnostic capacity compared with that obtained 
with gene expression alone.
Therefore, application of a cross-platform biomarker signature 
may be more capable of identifying bona fide tolerance, as in 
addition to gene expression and phenotype analysis, it can also 
take into consideration an individual’s immunological functional 
state, which may be more closely related to describing the mecha￾nistic basis of tolerance.

The utility of this cross-platform biomarker signature lies in its 
ability to identify renal transplant patients who may be unknow￾ingly operationally tolerant. As shown in Figure 8, C and D, 5 sta￾ble recipients of the test set could be identified to have the tolerant 
signature and therefore may benefit from managed weaning from 
immunosuppression. Interestingly, 2 CAN patients of the test set 
were also identified as having a high probability of being tolerant. 
This finding may be explained by differences in the clinical assess￾ment of chronic rejection, as unlike the CR group of the training 
set, CAN patients were not proven by biopsy to have immune￾mediated rejection, but were defined on the basis of poor graft 
function. It is possible that the cross-platform biomarkers used to 
test these patients have sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle differ￾ences between these 2 patient groups, 
a property that may be revealed by 
serial immune monitoring of patients 
such as these over time.
Discussion
In this study we have developed a 
cross-platform set of biomarkers that 
distinguish tolerant renal transplant 
recipients from patients with stable 
renal function under different degrees 
of immunosuppression, patients 
undergoing chronic rejection, and 
HCs. Biomarkers identified in a train￾ing set of tolerant patients have been 
validated in an independent test set.
Both this study and that of Newell 
et al. (9) have found an expansion of 
B and NK cells in peripheral blood of 
drug-free tolerant recipients, which is 
similar to the findings of a previous study on 
a smaller cohort of similar patients (14). Not 
only do our findings extend earlier observa￾tions, but they also highlight the value of 
an altered T/B cell ratio as a biomarker of 
transplantation tolerance. Microarray analy￾sis also revealed a clear and strong B cell bias 
of genes with altered expression between 
Tol-DF and the other groups. Whereas the 
role of T cells in initiating and maintain￾ing allograft rejection (15, 16) and tolerance 
(17) has been clearly established, the role of 
B cells and the mechanisms whereby they 
may contribute to the tolerant state have 
yet to be elucidated. Interestingly, a murine 
study of transplantation tolerance induced 
by anti-CD45RB therapy has shown a mech￾anistic role for B cells (18). Recent data have 
also shown the ability of naive B cells, follow￾ing antigen-specific cognate interactions, 
to induce Tregs that inhibit graft rejection 
in a murine model of heart transplanta￾tion (19). While no significant increase in 
Br-1 (IL-10–producing B cells) was detected 
in any patient group within this study, the 
data presented here show altered ratios of 
B cell transitional and memory populations, 
a relative increase in TGF-β–producing B cells, and absence of 
serum donor-specific antibodies and donor-specific direct T cell 
hyporesponsiveness in tolerant recipients. These observations allow 
speculation that renal transplant tolerance may be associated with 
alterations in both T cell– and B cell–mediated functions. Given the 
essential role of antigen-specific B cell–T cell help, this would be an 
anticipated finding, although no correlation between anti-donor 
IFN-γ ELISpot responder frequencies and the presence/absence of 
donor-specific antibodies was detected within other study groups 
(data not shown). However, Porcheray et al., studying both B cell 
and T cell immunity in combined kidney and bone marrow trans￾plant recipients, recently demonstrated the uncoupling of T cell 
and B cell anti-donor immunity in some of their tolerant patients

(20). In this respect, the B cell signature observed in tolerant renal 
patients in this study may indicate an important role for B cells 
in promoting tolerance, or it may simply be an epiphenomenon. 
Nonetheless, this and the study by Newell et al. (9) indicate that 
more research focus on B cells in transplantation is warranted.
Monitoring of anti-donor responses using functional assays has 
demonstrated that hyporesponsiveness of direct pathway T cells 
develops over time after solid organ transplantation (21, 22). In 
the clinical context, enumerating the frequency of anti-donor 
T cells has proven useful in steroid withdrawal protocols (23). 
In our study, measuring anti-donor direct pathway responses by 
ELISpot has also proven useful, where determining the ratio of 
responses against donor and third party reveals donor-specific 
hyporesponsiveness in tolerant patients. This test, however, is more 
useful when donor and recipient have several HLA mismatches.
Similar studies to this have focused on gene profiling of tolerant 
liver (24, 25) and also tolerant kidney recipients (26, 27). The set 
of genes that were differentially expressed in those studies and in 
the study reported here have little overlap. This possibly reflects 
differences in the organ, the patient groups, the RNA source and 
preparation protocol, or the analysis platform used. Indeed, the 
microarray used in this study was selectively designed based on 
both published and unpublished data to have a transplantation 
focus and therefore included a substantial number of immune 
response–related probes.
Of the genes identified by Martínez-Llordella et al. as being asso￾ciated with the gene profile of tolerant liver transplant recipients 
(24), 2 genes, KLRF1 (NKp80), expressed on all NK cells, and CLIC3
(chloride intracellular channel 3), were found to be highly differ￾entially expressed within the training and test sets of this study. 
Interestingly however, 2 of the most highly ranked genes associ￾ated with tolerance found within the training set, TCL1A (rank 2) 
and MS4A1 (CD20) (rank 5), are both B cell–related genes and have 
also been described by Newell et al. (9). Furthermore, MS4A1 has 
previously been identified by Braud et al. (26) as being associated 
with tolerant renal transplant patients. An additional 8 genes with 
highly differential expression, overlapping between the training 
and test sets, were common to several B cell–related genes iden￾tified by Newell et al., by their comparison of tolerant patients 
with stable or HC groups (FCRLA, IGHM, IGKV3, EBI2, CD40, 
BLNK, CD79A, CD79B) (9). The detection of significantly altered 
B cell–related gene expression by this study is further reinforced 
by the enrichment of genes with significantly different expres￾sion being found to predominantly associate with B cell–related 
pathway annotations. Although both this and the Newell study 
show a clear B cell bias in differentially expressed genes, the limited 
overlap between the most predictive genes of tolerance identified 
by our studies may be attributed to the distinct methods of RNA 
sample preparation and data analysis used (28).
A possible interpretation of the tolerant signature described by 
this study could be that the immunological biomarkers detected are 
merely due to the lack of drug-mediated immune suppression in the 
Tol-DF group. To address this possibility, the study groups of the 
training set were specifically selected to include stable renal trans￾plant patients on distinct immunosuppressive regimes and HCs 
as immune suppression-free subjects. Although clear differences 
between the HC and Tol-DF groups were observed in the training set, 
these differences were not reproduced in the test set, a finding that 
may be attributed to the fact that the mechanisms of tolerance may 
be more subtle within the test set, where tolerant recipients are highly 
HLA matched to their donors, in contrast to the training set.
As all of these study groups have been taken into consideration, 
the cross-platform signature described here appears to be a spe￾cific description of transplant tolerance, rather than simply a con￾sequence of the absence of immunosuppression. It is pertinent to 
observe that while detailed comparison of tolerant patients and 
HCs may reveal more about the mechanistic basis of tolerance, in 
the clinical context, this comparison is not entirely relevant.
An interesting comparison is that of Tol-DF and s-LP patient 
groups of the training set, which differ in the use of 10 mg/d pred￾nisone, considered by many clinicians as quasi-physiological. The 
s-LP group had a higher proportion of female recipients, a higher 
percentage of cadaveric donors, and poorer kidney function than 
the Tol-DF group. Rather counterintuitively, in most of the assays 
described, there are clear differences between these 2 groups in 
immunophenotype, anti-donor responses, FoxP3/α-1,2-manno￾sidase ratio, and gene expression. This supports the notion that 
steroid monotherapy can induce a significant difference in the 
patient’s immune status that can be evidenced by biomarkers.
One of the Tol-DF patients within the training set had received 
a bone marrow donation 4 years prior to kidney transplantation 
from the same donor. Immune suppression was initially with￾drawn from this patient, as evidence of chimerism was detected. 
As the mechanisms of tolerance induction could be different in 
this patient, biomarker and ROC curve analysis were performed 
with inclusion and exclusion of this patient; however, this patient

FDR. The top 10 ranked probes that overlapped with genes identified 
in the test set were subsequently used for ROC analysis.

did not appear as an outlier within the tolerant group in any of 
the assays in the study.
The utility of this tolerant signature depends on its ability to 
identify transplant recipients that can safely be weaned from 
immunosuppression. We have now developed a specific and sensi￾tive set of reproducible assays that, when combined, can identify 
tolerant renal allograft recipients and also several renal transplant 
recipients on immunosuppressive drugs. Validation of these bio￾markers and bioassays has been achieved using a completely inde￾pendent set of patients, and this validation is reinforced by the fact 
that the test set was derived from a genetically different popula￾tion and that there were also differences in the collection and pro￾cessing of test set and training set samples. However, before these 
cross-platform biomarkers can be implemented as a decisional 
tool in the clinical setting, the findings of this study are being car￾ried forward into a larger observational clinical study of immune 
monitoring in an independent cohort of renal transplant recipi￾ents (www.transplant-tolerance.org.uk). This signature provides 
a model for future immunosuppression minimization protocols, 
which in combination with immune monitoring of emerging bio￾markers of rejection (29, 30) may allow for tailored and safe clini￾cal posttransplantation management of renal allograft recipients.
Methods
Training set description. This cohort of patients, recruited by the IOT net￾work, consisted of 71 kidney transplant recipients and 19 age- and sex￾matched HCs. Five patient groups were included: 11 functionally stable 
kidney transplant recipients (serum CRT, <160 μmol/l; and <10% rise in 
the last 12 months) despite having stopped all their immunosuppression 
for more than 1 year (Tol-DF); 11 patients with stable renal function (same 
criteria) maintained on less than 10 mg/d prednisone as the only immu￾nosuppressive agent (s-LP); 10 patients maintained on “full” immunosup￾pression (azathioprine and prednisone) in the absence of a calcineurin 
inhibitor since transplantation (s-nCNI); 30 patients maintained on stan￾dard calcineurin inhibitor therapy (s-CNI); 9 patients with biopsy-proven 
(all reevaluated for this study) and immunologically driven chronic rejec￾tion (CR). Patient clinical characteristics are described in Table 1. eGFR 
was calculated from serum creatinine by the Modification of Diet in Renal 
Disease (MDRD) equation (http://nephron.org/mdrd_gfr_si).
Approval of the study protocol was obtained from the Hammersmith 
and St Mary’s Research Ethics Committee (REC), which was the main 
study REC (application: 2002/6378), and from the RECs of all other Euro￾pean recruitment sites. All participants in this study provided informed 
consent. All samples were processed and analyzed in a blinded fashion.
Test set description. An independent set of kidney transplant recipients 
were recruited in the United States through the ITN study; some of these 
patients were included and described by Newell et al. (9). The protocol was 
approved by the institutional review board of each participating center and 
by a data safety monitoring board convened by the NIAID. The cohort con￾sisted of (a) Tol-DF (n = 24) patients, functionally stable kidney transplant 
recipients (serum CRT within 25% of baseline) despite having stopped all 
immunosuppression for more than 1 year; (b) “Mono” patients (n = 11) 
with stable renal function who were maintained on monotherapy with 
steroids; (c) s-CNI subjects (n = 34), with clinically stable renal function 
using the same criteria as Tol-DF patients while on maintenance with a 
triple drug immunosuppressive regimen (including a calcineurin or mTOR 
inhibitor, an anti-proliferative agent, and corticosteroids); and (d) CAN 
participants (n = 20), defined as those with chronic allograft nephropathy

and impaired renal function (50% increase in their baseline CRT at the time 
of enrollment relative to their initial posttransplantation baseline) due to 
presumed immune-mediated allograft rejection. An additional group of 
31 HC volunteers with no known history of renal disease/dysfunction or 
evidence of acute medical illness was enrolled. Group characteristics are 
summarized in Table 3.
Whole blood mRNA and frozen PBMCs were received by laboratories 
performing the selected validation assays described.
Blood samples. The training set samples were processed in all cases within 
24 hours of venesection. PBMCs were obtained by density gradient centrif￾ugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (PAA Laboratories). Cells 
were washed and resuspended in 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and human 
serum (BioWest) and frozen immediately at –80°C. After 24 hours cells 
were transferred into liquid nitrogen and kept until use.
Flow cytometry on PBMCs. Thawed PBMCs were washed and resuspended 
at 1 × 106/ml. Titrated amounts of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies were used to identify leukocytes, CD45+CD14– for lymphocytes, 
CD3+ for T cells, CD19+ for B cells, CD56+CD3– for NK cells, CD4+CD3+

memory B cells, CD19+CD27–CD24intCD38int for naive/mature B cells, and 
CD19+CD27–CD24+CD38hi for T1/T2 transitional B cells (all from Caltag). 
Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS and data acquired on a 
FACScalibur (BD) within 48 hours. CD25 expression was studied on CD4+
T cells as described in ref. 32. B cell production of TGF-β, IL-10, and IFN-γ
(all from eBioscience) was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining on in 
vitro stimulated PBMCs with 500 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
and 1 μM ionomycin in the presence of 2 μM monensin and 10 μg/ml 
brefeldin A for 5 hours at 37°C. A minimum of 10,000 CD19+ events were 
acquired for each sample.
Anti-donor antibody detection. Peripheral blood was collected in clotting 
activator vacutainers (BD) and allowed to clot for a minimum of 2 and 
a maximum of 24 hours. Samples were centrifuged and collected serum 
stored at –80°C until use.
Screening for IgG anti-HLA antibodies of any specificity by xMAP (Luminex) tech￾nology. Screening was performed as previously described (33). After wash￾ing, HLA-coated Luminex screening beads and 12.5 μl of patient serum or 
control serum were added on a plate and mixed gently for 30 minutes in 
the dark. Plates were washed 3 times and PE-conjugated goat anti-human 
IgG (1:10) added to each test well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour, wash 
buffer was added, and then data were collected using the Luminex 100 
instrument, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Screening for IgG subclass and anti-HLA broad specificity. Positive sera were 
tested for IgG subclass identification and class I and class II broad specific￾ity distinction. Screening was performed using class I and II Luminex iden￾tification kits (Quest Biomedical). Secondary antibodies used for detection 
of bound patient antibodies were as follows: anti-human IgG1 conjugated 
to biotin (clone 8c/6–39, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-human IgG2 conjugated to 
biotin (clone HP-6014, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-human IgG3 conjugated to 
biotin (clone HP-6050, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-human IgG4 conjugated to 
biotin (clone HP-6050, Sigma-Aldrich), and streptavidin-PE (Calbiochem).
Cell fractions for functional assays. PBMCs were thawed on the day of the 
assay. T cell subsets CD4+ and CD4+CD25– (CD4+ depleted of CD25+ cells) 
were separated using standard methods of negative immune isolation as 
previously described (34). Purity was verified by flow cytometry.
Donor, surrogate donor, and third-party cells. Cells from the 31 living kidney 
donors were used for the 71 donor-specific cellular assays on the train￾ing set, and 28 of 64 cell samples on the test set. Where donor blood was 
unavailable, surrogate donor cells were obtained. These cells and similarly 
mismatched third-party cells were used from: healthy volunteers from the 
Anthony Nolan bone marrow registry, HLA-typed healthy volunteers and 
splenocytes collected at the time of cadaveric donation at the Hammer￾smith and Guy’s Hospitals in London.
Similarly mismatched third-party cells were selected by the number of 
HLA mismatches for class II (HLA-DR and HLA-DQ) when compared with 
the relevant donor and recipient.
Mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures for ELISpot. Human IFN-γ ELISpotPRO
(Mabtech) kits were used and developed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Background-deducted positive spots were enumerated using 
an automatic image analyzer for ELISpot plates (AID). Quantitative assess￾ment of direct pathway donor antigen–specific responder T cell frequen￾cies was made by stimulating recipient CD4+ T cells with T cell– and NK 
cell–depleted PBMCs (APCs) separated from either donor PBMCs or HLA￾typed third-party cells. Allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures were 
performed over 24 hours. Duplicates were set up with 3 doubling dilutions 
starting typically at 2 × 105 responder cells per well. The ratio of stimulator 
to responder cells was kept constant by always using half the number of 
APCs compared with the number of responder cells used in the top dilu￾tion, typically 1 × 105 responders per well. Donor reactivity was expressed 
as a ratio of frequency to donor and frequency to third party. The inverse 
of the frequency was recorded in the database (i.e., 1 in 54,000 cells was 
recorded as 54,000); therefore, ratio values greater than 1.5 were defined as 
indicating a hyporesponse to donor stimulation.
Blood sampling for gene expression analysis. For the training set cohort, 
peripheral vein blood was drawn directly into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes 
(QIAGEN). Whole blood RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood 
RNA Kit including DNAse I treatment (QIAGEN).
For the test set cohort, peripheral vein blood was drawn directly into Tem￾pus Blood RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Whole blood RNA was 
extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (9). Total RNA sam￾ples were subjected to gene expression analysis by RT-PCR and microarrays.
Samples for mRNA studies. Ninety-five samples from the training set were 
used, consisting of 13 samples from 10 Tol-DF patients, 16 samples from 
11 s-LP patients, 8 samples from 8 s-nCNI patients, 40 samples from 28 
s-CNI patients, 10 samples from 9 CR patients, and 8 samples from 8 HCs.
As the test set, 142 samples from the ITN cohort were used, consisting of 
31 samples from 23 Tol-DF patients, 14 samples from 11 Mono patients, 
52 samples from 34 s-CNI patients, 25 samples from 18 CAN patients, and 
20 samples from 20 HCs.
RNA quality control. Quality and integrity of PAXgene (training set) and 
Tempus-purified (test set) RNA were determined using the Agilent RNA 
6000 Nano Kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). 
RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm on the ND-1000 
Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).
RNA amplification and labeling. Sample labeling was performed as 
detailed in ref. 35. Briefly, 0.5 μg total RNA was used for the amplifica￾tion and labeling steps using the Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amp 
Kit (Agilent Technologies) in the presence of cyanine 3-CTP. Yields of 
cRNA and the dye incorporation rate were measured with the ND-1000 
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Hybridization of RISET 2.0 Agilent custom microarrays. All whole blood sam￾ples were hybridized on the RISET 2.0 microarray platform. This is a cus￾tom Agilent 8 × 15K 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray comprising 5,069 
probes represented in triplicate. Probes selected corresponded to 4,607 
genes with a valid Entrez Gene ID and an additional 407 probes that could 
not be assigned to a valid Entrez Gene ID. The microarray is focused on the 
detection of genes relevant in the field of transplantation and was designed 
based on current literature and published and unpublished data provided 
by RISET consortium partners. Probe design was optimized for the detec￾tion of multiple transcript variants of a gene, on optimized hybridization 
properties of the probes, and avoiding cross-hybridization.
The hybridization procedure was performed after control of RNA qual￾ity and integrity and according to ref. 35 using the Agilent Gene Expres￾sion Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, 0.6 μg Cy3-labeled 
fragmented cRNA in hybridization buffer was hybridized overnight (17 
hours, 65°C) to RISET 2.0 microarrays. Following hybridization, the 
microarrays were washed once with Agilent Gene Expression Wash Buffer 1 
for 1 minute at room temperature, followed by a second wash with pre￾heated (37°C) Agilent Gene Expression Wash Buffer 2 containing 0.005% 
N-lauroylsarcosine for 1 minute. The last washing step was performed 
with acetonitrile for 30 seconds.
Scanning and data analysis. Fluorescence signals of the Agilent Microarrays 
were detected using Agilent’s Microarray Scanner System (Agilent Technol￾ogies Inc.). The Agilent Feature Extraction Software (FES version 9.5.1.1) 
was used to read out and process the microarray image files. To determine 
differential gene expression, FES-derived output data files were further 
analyzed using the Rosetta Resolver gene expression data analysis system 
(version 7.1.0.2., Rosetta Inpharmatics LLC).
First, an artificial common reference was computed from all samples 
included in the IOT dataset. Using this baseline, log2 ratios were calculated

for each gene and sample. Additionally, P values indicating the reliability of 
an observed difference between a sample and the common reference were 
calculated for each gene, applying the universal error model implemented 
in the Rosetta Resolver software (36).
Annotation enrichment analysis. Lists of genes found to be discriminatory 
between different sample groups, and common to both study sets, were 
analyzed for a statistically significant enrichment of biological pathway 
annotation terms in comparison to the complete RISET 2.0 microarray 
configuration. Term enrichment relative to the expected background dis￾tribution was scored using Fisher’s exact test. Annotations were derived 
from different sources, e.g., Gene Ontology (GO, www.geneontology.org), 
signaling pathway membership, sequence motifs, chromosomal proximity, 
literature keywords, and cell-specific marker genes.
The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s 
Gene Expression Omnibus (37) and are accessible through GEO Series 
accession number GSE14655 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE14655).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Whole blood total RNA (200 ng) was reverse 
transcribed using the QPCR First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Stratagene), and 
synthesized cDNA was subjected to RT-PCR analysis.
Microarray data validation. A selected set of genes identified by microarray 
gene expression analysis were validated by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was performed 
for the following genes using pre-made TaqMan panels from Applied Biosys￾tems: Hs01017452_m1 B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK), Hs00236881_m1 
CD79b molecule (CD79b), Hs01099196_m1 heparan sulfate (glucosamine) 
3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS3ST1), Hs01592483_m1 SH2 domain containing 
1B (SH2D1B), Hs00172040_m1 T cell leukemia (TCL1A).
Other assays screened in the training set. We also performed indirect pathway 
IFN-γ ELISpot, direct and indirect pathway trans-vivo delayed-type hyper￾sensitivity assays, RT-PCR amplification for cytokine genes on direct and 
indirect pathway cultures of donor and recipient cells, and TCR-repertoire 
profiling by TCR landscape analysis.
Statistics. Nonparametric tests were used to estimate statistical signifi￾cance, as n < 20 in many group comparisons and data did not conform 
to a normal distribution. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare 
responses within the same group of patients. Mann-Whitney U tests were 
used to compare medians between patient groups. To compare associa￾tions between clinical variables, usually recorded as categorical data and 
the presence or absence of anti-HLA antibodies, we used Fisher’s exact 
test. Two-sided P values were used to indicate a significant difference 
when it was less than 0.05.
Statistical analysis of microarrays and biomarkers. Significantly altered expres￾sion detected by microarray was statistically determined using 4-class anal￾ysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for 
FDR at 1%. We chose a nonparametric test for this analysis, as the data in 
some cases appeared to deviate from normality. A similar procedure was 
used to rank the biomarkers (tested on the log scale, with missing values 
set equal to the sample-wide mean).
To evaluate the predictive power of a number of variables to detect toler￾ant patients, we used ROC curves. To build these, first 4-class analysis iden￾tified differentially expressed probes of Tol-DF within the training set and 
were ranked using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Then the top-most significantly 
differentially expressed probes were added in a binary regression model 
and used to perform classification within sample. The binary regression 
procedure was used to compute probabilities p[1], . . . ,p[n] of being a Tol￾DF patient for each subject. The ROC curve was produced by varying a 
probability threshold between 0 and 1; for each value of the threshold t, a 
2 × 2 classification table of actual class versus predicted class for subject i was 
set equal to “Tol-DF” if p[i] > t. Bootstrap resampling of the subjects indi￾cated that the within-sample classification results were robust. For the ITN 
test set, the same probes from the training set analysis were used.
