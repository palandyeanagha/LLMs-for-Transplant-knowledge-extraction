Abstract
Background: Hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are considered a major prognostic factor associated with
significantly reduced survival compared to patients without liver metastases. Several surgical and nonsurgical strategies are
present to treat resectable and nonresectable liver metastases, some of which have the potential to cure liver mestatases.
Objective: The aims of the four systematic reviews presented in the paper are to determine the effectiveness of liver resection
versus nonsurgical treatment of patients with NET liver metastases, to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment
options on the tumor-free survival, to assess the role of liver transplantation in patients presenting with unresectable bilateral
hepatic metastases, and to evaluate the role of primary tumor resection in presence of unresectable liver metastases.
Methods: Literature search was performed on Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica
Database, and the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects,
and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). No language restrictions were applied. Randomized controlled trials,
prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies, and case-control studies will be used for the qualitative and quantitative
synthesis of the systematic reviews. Case series will be only included in a separate database for descriptive purposes.
Results: This study is ongoing and presents a protocol system of four systematic reviews that will assist in determining the
effectiveness of liver resection versus nonsurgical treatment of patients with NET liver metastases. This study is also assumed
to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment options on the tumor-free survival, the role of liver transplantation,
and the relevance of primary tumor resection in presence of unresectable liver metastasis.
Conclusions: The systematic reviews will show the current evidence based on the effectiveness of surgical strategies in patients
with NET liver metastases and serve as basis for clinical practice guidelines.

Introduction
Background
Neuroendocrine Tumors
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) developing from neuroendocrine
cells can originate almost everywhere in the body [1]. Primary
NETs are mainly located in the bronchopulmonary (>25%) and
the gastroenteropancreatic system (60%) [2,3]. With an annual
age-adjusted incidence of 5.25 cases per 100,000 people, NETs
are considered to be rare tumors. Most NETs occur sporadically,
whereas a minority of cases may develop due to genetic
syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [4].
According to their functional behavior, NETs can be subdivided
into two categories: functioning NETs and nonfunctioning NETs
[5]. Functioning NETs secrete specific products such as biogenic
amines and polypeptide hormones and can cause endocrine
syndromes such as the carcinoid syndrome. Endocrine
syndromes in tumors with portal venous drainage often begin
in the presence of liver metastases. Metastases drain active
hormones directly into the systemic circulation while the liver
metabolizes hormones derived from primary tumors [6,7].
Therefore, functioning tumors are usually detected earlier than
nonfunctioning tumors and patients seem to have a better overall
survival (OS) [8]. The nonfunctioning NETs may cause local
tumor mass-related symptoms or are found incidentally [7,9].
Liver Metastases of NETs
Despite the slow growing nature of NETs, Pape et al reported
liver metastases of gastroenteropancreatic NETs in 84.7% of
cases at the initial diagnosis [10]. Due to the favorable
environment, metastases of NETs are confined to the liver for
a prolonged period of time [11]. Hepatic metastases are
considered to be a major prognostic factor, associated with a
significantly reduced survival compared to patients without
liver metastases [12,13]. Furthermore, the metastatic pattern
within the liver also has prognostic and therapeutic impact.
Frilling et al suggested three different patterns of liver
metastases: single metastasis of any size (type 1); isolated
metastatic bulk accompanied by smaller deposits, with both
liver lobes always involved (type 2); and disseminated metastatic
spread, with both liver lobes always involved, single lesion of
varying size and virtually no normal liver parenchyma (type 3).
This classification is believed to represent differences in biologic
characteristics of the tumors, which require different treatment
strategies [14].
Liver Resection
A wide array of options is available to treat liver metastases
from NETs, which improves the 5-year OS in 60-80% patients
who have undergone curative surgery compared to less than
40% untreated patients [15-17]. Surgical interventions contain
potentially curative resection of the metastases (R0/R1). If
R0/R1 resection is not feasible, a palliative resection is
performed in patients suffering from tumor bulk or hormonal
symptoms, especially in patients with functioning NETs and
who are unresponsive to treatment. However, guidelines suggest
that palliative surgery should only be performed if at least 90%
of the metastatic bulk can be safely removed [18]. Curative
resection can only be achieved in patients with a metastatic
pattern type 1, while patients with type 2 or 3 need to be
evaluated for other treatment options [14]. Therefore, curative
resection is only feasible in less than 20% of patients due to the
high rate of diffuse and bilobar spreading of metastases [19].
For patients with a metastatic pattern type 2 or 3, there are
several locoregional techniques such as radiofrequency ablation,
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and
systemically applied therapies (eg, chemotherapy or peptide
receptor radionuclide therapy [PRRT]) [17]. The first systematic
review intends to compare curative and palliative liver resection
versus or in combination with nonsurgical treatment options.
Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment Options
Disease recurrence after surgical treatment of liver metastases
is often observed, even when resection is performed with
curative intent [20]. To increase the resectability and to reduce
the high rate of metastatic relapse, neoadjuvant and adjuvant
treatment options need to be evaluated. According to their
treatment modality, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment options
can be divided into systemic (chemotherapy, biotherapy, and
PRRT) and liver-directed therapies (selective internal radiation
therapy [SIRT], transcatheter arterial embolization [TAE], and
TACE). For the chemotherapeutical strategy, several substances
have been used to treat NETs, either as a monotherapy or
combined in different regimens [21-23]. Biotherapy for NETs
essentially includes treatment with somatostatin analogues, such
as octreotide and lanreotide, in order to control hormone-related
symptoms [24]. PRRT consists of systemically applied
radiolabeled somatostatin derivates that bind specifically to the
somatostatin receptor, which is overexpressed in certain NETs
and thereby damage the tumor cell [25]. Liver-directed
techniques, such as SIRT, TAE, and TACE, make use of the
biologic feature that hepatic neoplasms are preferentially
supplied via the hepatic artery, whereas normal liver parenchyma
is mainly supplied by the portal vein [26,27].
For liver metastases arising from a non-NET primary tumor,
the benefit of neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies combined
with liver resection has already been investigated in more detail
[28,29]. Nordlinger et al reported that the risk of recurrent
disease in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas

could be reduced compared to surgical resections alone [29].
Adopting these strategies to the treatment of NET liver
metastasis could be a promising option. The second systematic
review intends to evaluate whether neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant
treatment strategies together with surgical resection are superior
to liver resection alone.
Liver Transplantation
Controversy concerning liver metastases from NETs as an
indication for liver transplantation arises inter alia from the
relatively low number of such patients being transplanted.
Moreover, heterogeneous 5-year OS data have been published
with ranges between 33% and 96% [16,30]. Therefore, our third
systematic review aims to evaluate the possible benefit of liver
transplantation as a treatment option for unresectable hepatic
metastases of NETs and to define selection criteria to choose
patients with the best possible prognosis.
Resection of the Primary NET
Another important question is whether the primary tumor should
be removed in presence of nonresectable liver metastases as the
answer may improve the outcome. Potential benefits of resection
are seen in providing relief from hormonal and local tumor
mass-related symptoms [31]. Since evidence is missing, the
fourth systematic review aims to answer this question.
Objective
The purpose of these four systematic reviews is to assess the
role of surgical strategies in the management of liver metastases
of nets, to evaluate the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant
therapies, to define selection criteria for patients who benefit
the most from liver transplantation, and to study the influence
of resection of the primary tumor.
Methods
Overview
These four systematic reviews dealing with surgical treatment
options for NET liver metastases attempt to answer the questions
with regard to liver resection in patients with hepatic metastases
(see Textbox 1), neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment strategies
(see Textbox 2), liver transplantation in patients with
unresectable hepatic metastases (see Textbox 3), and resection
of the locoregional primary neuroendocrine tumor (see Textbox
4).
We will report our review findings in accordance with the
standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses [32]. Our reviews were
prospectively registered with the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews: liver resection
(CRD42012002652) [33], neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment
strategies (CRD42012002656) [34], liver transplantation
(CRD42012002655) [35], and resection of the locoregional
primary NET (CRD42012002654) [36].
The systematic review inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed
in Tables 1-4. No language or publication date restrictions were
imposed on the literature search. All accessible publications
were included. The following study designs will be included
for the qualitative synthesis of the systematic review:
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and
retrospective comparative cohort studies, and case-control
studies. Case series will only be included in a separate database
for descriptive purposes. The number of excluded studies and
reasons for exclusion will be reported in a flow diagram,
according to the PRISMA Statement 2009 (Figure 1) [32].

transplanting improve the selection of patients (disease-free survival, overall survival, quality of life) as opposed to early transplantation (<6 months)?
In patients with NET liver metastases listed for liver transplantation, does downstaging (locally ablative techniques, percutaneous liver-directed
techniques, peptide receptor radionuclide treatment, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biotherapy) improve outcome (tumor-free survival, overall
survival, quality of life)?

quality of life) as opposed to deceased-donor transplantation or non-surgical treatment (locally ablative techniques, percutaneous liver-directed
techniques, peptide receptor radionuclide treatment, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biotherapy)?
Does the outcome of the recipient justify the risk of the donor in the setting of liver transplantation for NET liver metastases?
Textbox 4. Questions with regard to resection of the locoregional primary neuroendocrine tumor in the presence of nonresectable liver metastases.

chemotherapy, biotherapy)?
In patients with a lung primary NET and non-resectable liver metastases, does resecting the primary tumor improve outcome (progression-free survival,
overall survival, quality of life) when compared to non-surgical treatment (peptide receptor radionuclide treatment, chemotherapy, biotherapy)?

Search
Librarians of the Medical Library Careum, University of Zurich,
Switzerland, developed the electronic search strategy to query
databases and to identify all potentially relevant articles (see
Multimedia Appendix 1). The following databases were
searched: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System
Online, Excerpta Medica Database, and the Cochrane Library
(Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials). The investigators were provided with an
endnote file containing all identified titles and, if available, the
corresponding abstracts. Additional articles were retrieved
through manual search or scanning of reference lists. Titles
and/or abstracts of all identified records were independently
screened by 2 members of the review team to ascertain their
relevance and to identify studies that potentially meet the
inclusion criteria as outlined in Tables 1-4. The full text of each
of these potentially relevant studies was then assessed for
eligibility. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion
with a third review team member. A predefined protocol was
used to extract data from the included studies for the assessment
of study quality and evidence synthesis.
Data Extraction
The following parameters will be chosen for data extraction:
first author’s name, publication year, answering scientific
questions, study design, total number of patients, number of

patients in the study group, number of patients in the comparison
group, type of nonsurgical treatment, age (mean, SD, median),
male-to-female ratio, progression-free survival, OS, quality of
life (tools), and hazard risk ratio. The Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
will be used to grade the quality (level) of evidence and the
strength of recommendations [37].
A narrative synthesis of the findings from the included studies
will be provided. A quantitative synthesis will be used for
studies that are sufficiently homogenous from a clinical
(population comparability, interventions, and outcomes) and
from a statistical perspective (heterogeneity, eg, I
2
<50%). It is
anticipated that there will be a limited scope for meta-analysis
despite a relatively large number of studies due to different
outcome measurements of the existing trials as such tumors are
rare. However, results from studies using the same type of
intervention and comparator with the same outcome
measurements will be pooled using a random-effects
meta-analysis. In addition, risk ratios for binary outcomes, 95%
CI, and two-sided P values will be calculated for each outcome.
Results
This study is ongoing and presents a protocol system of four
systematic reviews that will assist in determining the
effectiveness of liver resection versus nonsurgical treatment of
patients with NET liver metastases. This study is also assumed
to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment
options on the tumor-free survival, the role of liver
transplantation, and the relevance of primary tumor resection
in presence of unresectable liver metastasis.
Discussion
The use of surgical strategies for the treatment of patients with
liver metastases from NET is still controversial. An important
step toward developing a consensus is to summarize the existing
scientific literature.
Regarding liver resection in patients with liver metastases from
NETs, Gurusamy et al presented 2 Cochrane Collaboration
systematic reviews on liver resection and cytoreductive surgery
versus nonsurgical treatments in patients with resectable and
nonresectable liver metastases. Publications until July 2008
were included in their reviews. Based on nonrandomized studies,
they came to the conclusion that liver resection “appears to be
the main stay curative treatment for neuroendocrine liver
metastases” [38,39]. Our systematic review will consider data
published until 2012.
Regarding neoadjuvant therapies, PRRT seems to be a possible
neoadjuvant option in initially unresectable primary NETs,
while its benefit in the treatment of NET liver metastases needs
to be elucidated [40]. Apart from PRRT, chemotherapy and
biologic therapies (eg, octreotide) also need to be evaluated in
the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.
Liver transplantation is a controversially discussed treatment
option in patients with liver metastases from NETs, because it
is not clear which patients benefit most from this therapeutic
strategy. Máthé et al performed a systematic review to
investigate the benefit of liver transplantation for hepatic
metastases of pancreatic NETs and grouped patients according
to their age (less than 55 years or 55 years or older) and surgical
procedure they underwent (pancreatic resection prior to liver
transplantation or simultaneous resection). The 5-year OS was
found to be significantly different between patients who were
less than 55 years of age and had pancreatic resection prior to
transplantation compared to patients who were 55 years of age
or older and underwent simultaneous resection (5-year OS 61%
vs 0%) [41]. Reaching an overall 5-year survival of incredibly
96%, the Milan criteria seem to provide a good foundation for
further improvement of the selection criteria [16]. Therefore,
and in combination with the scarcity of donor organs, it is crucial
to evaluate and define accurate selection criteria for potential
transplant recipients to offer these patients the most promising
and evidence-based treatment.
Surgical resection of NETs is the treatment strategy whenever
a curative intent is anticipated. However, it is not clear whether
resection of the primary NET is still beneficial in advanced
disease stage presenting with unresectable liver metastases.
Bettini et al investigated the role of primary tumor resection in
nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs with unresectable liver
metastases [42]. OS did not differ significantly, although
survival was longer in patients with resected primary tumor. A
significant difference in improvement of symptoms in favor of
primary resection was observed, although quality of life was
not assessed objectively. Therefore, resection was considered
as palliative therapy in order to relief symptoms related to
primary tumor mass and prevent obstructive complications such
as bleeding, acute pancreatitis, or jaundice.
The four systematic reviews described in this protocol will help
to elucidate the role of surgical strategies and serve as a basis
for developing clinical practice guidelines.
