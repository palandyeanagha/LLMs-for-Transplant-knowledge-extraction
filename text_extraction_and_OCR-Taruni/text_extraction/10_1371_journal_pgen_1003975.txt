Abstract
Klotho acts as a co-receptor for and dictates tissue specificity of circulating FGF23. FGF23 inhibits PTH secretion, and
reduced Klotho abundance is considered a pathogenic factor in renal secondary hyperparathyroidism. To dissect the role of
parathyroid gland resident Klotho in health and disease, we generated mice with a parathyroid-specific Klotho deletion
(PTH-KL2/2). PTH-KL2/2 mice had a normal gross phenotype and survival; normal serum PTH and calcium; unaltered
expression of the PTH gene in parathyroid tissue; and preserved PTH response and sensitivity to acute changes in serum
calcium. Their PTH response to intravenous FGF23 delivery or renal failure did not differ compared to their wild-type
littermates despite disrupted FGF23-induced activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Importantly, calcineurin-NFAT signaling,
defined by increased MCIP1 level and nuclear localization of NFATC2, was constitutively activated in PTH-KL2/2 mice.
Treatment with the calcineurin-inhibitor cyclosporine A abolished FGF23-mediated PTH suppression in PTH-KL2/2 mice
whereas wild-type mice remained responsive. Similar results were observed in thyro-parathyroid explants ex vivo.
Collectively, we present genetic and functional evidence for a novel, Klotho-independent, calcineurin-mediated FGF23
signaling pathway in parathyroid glands that mediates suppression of PTH. The presence of Klotho-independent FGF23
effects in a Klotho-expressing target organ represents a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of FGF23 endocrine action.

Introduction
Calcium plays a pivotal role in many biological processes, such
as intra-cellular signaling, cell membrane depolarization and
excitation, energy metabolism and skeletal mineralization. Ac￾cordingly, a fine-tuned regulation of serum calcium level is a
prerequisite for normal cellular and organ function in most
organisms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the principal hormonal
regulator of circulating calcium as it rapidly increases its renal
tubular reabsorption and mobilization from bone deposits in
response to a decrease in serum calcium [1]. In turn, free calcium
ions can efficiently inhibit PTH secretion as part of an endocrine
feedback loop mediated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)
located on parathyroid chief cells [2].
Type I membrane-bound alpha-Klotho (Klotho) defines
tissue specificity for the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast
growth factor-23 (FGF23) by acting as a permissive co-receptor
[3]. Klotho is predominantly expressed in organs requiring
abundant calcium transport such as kidneys, parathyroid
glands and choroid plexus [4]. In the parathyroids, FGF23
binds to binary complexes of an FGF receptor (FGFR) and
Klotho to suppress PTH secretion [5,6]. Klotho activity on the
other hand has been implicated as fundamental for the
stimulation of PTH secretion during hypocalcemic conditions
[7], although the underlying mechanism has been challenged
[8].
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a common mani￾festation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite markedly
increased serum FGF23 concentrations. This presumably reflects
parathyroid resistance to FGF23 action, which was also
supported by lack of response to FGF23 injections in a rat
model of CKD [9,10]. The proposed mechanism underlying such
FGF23 resistance is decreased abundance of parathyroid Klotho
and FGFRs [11,12].
To dissect the role of parathyroid gland resident Klotho in
physiology and in pathophysiological states such as CKD, we
generated a novel mouse strain harboring a parathyroid-specific
deletion of the Klotho gene. The present study sheds new light on
the function of parathyroid Klotho and identifies a novel, Klotho￾independent signaling pathway of FGF23 that is involved in the
regulation of PTH secretion.

Results
Generation of PTH-KL2/2 mice
Mice with a parathyroid specific deletion of Klotho (PTH-KL2/
2) were generated using Cre-LoxP recombination (Figure S1).
Floxed Klotho mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre
recombinase driven by the human PTH promoter, which was
previously shown to have Cre activity exclusively in the
parathyroid glands [13]. Successful deletion of parathyroid Klotho
protein was confirmed with immunohistochemical staining of
thyro-parathyroid tissue (Figure 1). Overall efficiency of deletion
varied, and was up to .90% in investigated samples. Subanalyses
of mice with the most efficient deletion showed similar results to
the full analyses.
Gross phenotype and survival of PTH-KL2/2 mice
Adult PTH-KL2/2 mice were viable, fertile and did not display
any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. Survival was
similar to wild-type littermates during the study with no mortality
up to 6 months of age. Female PTH-KL2/2 mice had reduced
body weight and crown-rump length compared to wild-type
littermates (p,0.05; Figure 1), whereas no such differences were
found in male PTH-KL2/2 mice.
Serum and urine biochemistries of PTH-KL2/2 mice
Serum biochemistries in 8-week-old mice are shown in Figure 1.
Interestingly, the serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3
(1,25(OH)2D) were doubled in PTH-KL2/2 mice compared to
their wild-type littermates (p,0.05), while PTH, calcium and
FGF23 remained normal. Serum phosphorous (wild-type vs PTH￾KL2/2; 9.5460.38 vs 9.3960.32, p.0.05), creatinine (0.3160.03
vs 0.2660.02, p.0.05), urinary concentrations of calcium/creati￾nine (0.5360.19 vs 0.5360.19, p.0.05) and phosphorous/creat￾inine (19.163.4 vs 19.463.0, p.0.05) were also unaltered in PTH￾KL2/2 mice. To exclude the possibility of early onset changes in
mineral metabolism, we analyzed serum from 3-week-old animals.
No differences were seen for serum calcium (wild-type vs PTH-KL2/
2; 10.0060.22 vs 9.8660.20, p.0.05) or PTH (118.0613.4 vs
133.0621.8, p.0.05).
Bone and renal phenotype of PTH-KL2/2 mice
We investigated potential secondary effects that the parathy￾roid-specific deletion of the Klotho gene might have on the main
target organs of PTH signaling, namely bone and kidney. There
were no significant histological changes in bone from 6-week old
PTH-KL2/2 mice and bone mineral density was unaltered
compared to wild-type mice (Figure S2). Renal histology was also
normal and no transcriptional changes were found for Klotho, VDR,
Cyp27b1, Cyp24a1, Npt2a, TRPV5 or CaSR in kidneys from PTH￾KL2/2 mice compared to wild-type mice (Table S1).
Parathyroid histology and protein expression in PTH-KL2/
2 mice
Parathyroid size, histology and proliferation index, defined as
Ki67 positive cells/total number of cells, was not affected by the
Klotho gene deletion (wild-type vs PTH-KL2/2, 2.9% vs. 2.8%,
p.0.05) (Figure S3A). Immunofluorescence staining showed no
significant changes in protein expression for PTH, CaSR, VDR
(Figure S3B), FGFR1 or Cyp27b1 (data not shown) suggesting that
Klotho does not regulate the expression of these proteins in an
autocrine or paracrine fashion under physiological conditions.
Expression of genes critical for parathyroid function in
PTH-KL2/2 mice
The expression of approximately 90 genes critical for parathy￾roid function was examined using a nanostring array. The data are
compiled in Table S2. In addition to Klotho, changes in expression
level were observed for genes important for transcriptional and
metabolic control, such as Cfd (Entrez Gene: 11537), Fabp4 (11770)
and Smad4 (17128)(Figure 2). Gli3 (14634), Pin1 (23988), sFRP3
(20379) and FGF20 (80857) were also expressed at different levels
in the parathyroids of PTH-KL2/2 mice compared to wild-type
mice, although at a low absolute level. Notably, the expression of
some of the genes that play a key role in the function of the
parathyroid gland, such as PTH, Gata3, CaSR and VDR, or in
FGF23 physiology, such as FGFR1 and the vitamin D regulatory
enzymes Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1, were not significantly affected by
the knockdown of parathyroid Klotho gene expression.
Parathyroid sensitivity and response to rapid changes in
serum calcium in PTH-KL2/2 mice
The serum calcium level of PTH-KL2/2 and wild-type mice was
either rapidly decreased or increased by an intraperitoneal
injection of EGTA or calcium-gluconate, respectively [14]. The
parathyroid response to alterations in serum calcium, as measured
by serum PTH level, did not differ between PTH-KL2/2 mice and
wild-type mice (wild-type vs PTH-KL2/2, R2= 0.77, p,0.0001 vs
R2= 0.74, p,0.0001)(Figure S4), supporting that parathyroid
Klotho is not essential for parathyroid sensitivity to acute changes
in serum calcium, and its response to them with altered PTH
secretion.
Parathyroid response to induction of renal failure in PTH￾KL2/2 mice
Renal insufficiency is associated with the development of sHPT.
To test whether parathyroid function is different in PTH-KL2/2
mice under conditions of renal insufficiency, we induced renal
failure using an adenine-based protocol [15]. Four weeks after
induction of renal insufficiency, PTH-KL2/2 mice exhibited sHPT
Author Summary
Inorganic calcium is a critical element for a diverse range of
cellular processes ranging from cell signaling to energy
metabolism, and its extracellular concentration is con￾trolled by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Klotho is expressed
in parathyroid chief cells and reported to facilitate PTH
secretion during hypocalcemia and mediate FGF23 sup￾pression of PTH synthesis and secretion. To dissect the role
of parathyroid Klotho in health and disease, we generated
parathyroid-specific Klotho knockout mice. The mutant
mice had normal serum levels of PTH and calcium. Further,
their parathyroid sensitivity to acute fluctuations in serum
calcium and response to FGF23 treatment were preserved,
and mutant mice developed secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism of similar magnitude as wild-type mice when
challenged with renal failure. A previously unknown
parathyroid FGF23 signaling pathway involving calcineurin
was constitutively activated in the mutant mice, and
blocking this pathway abolished FGF23-induced suppres￾sion of PTH secretion. Our data challenges the concepts of
Klotho as a mandatory factor for the acute hypocalcemic
PTH response and decreased Klotho abundance as a
pathogenic factor in secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Finally, the presence of Klotho-independent FGF23 effects
in a Klotho-expressing target organ represents a paradigm
shift in the conceptualization of FGF23 endocrine action.

just like their wild-type littermates did. Its severity as well as
changes in other markers of mineral metabolism was similar
among PTH-KL2/2 and wild-type mice (Figure 3A and Table S3).
Notably, serum FGF23 levels were increased by approximately 50-
fold in both PTH-KL2/2 and wild-type mice with renal failure
compared to mice with preserved renal function.
Parathyroid response to FGF23 in PTH-KL2/2 mice
Based on our findings that the parathyroid glands of
PTH-KL2/2 mice retained calcium sensitivity and that sHPT
developed similarly as in wild-type mice upon induction of renal
insufficiency, we reasoned that the parathyroid response to FGF23
might also be preserved in PTH-KL2/2 mice. To test this, we
injected mice intravenously with a single dose of recombinant
FGF23 and measured serum concentrations of PTH before and
15 min after the injection. As shown in Figure 3B, FGF23 caused a
decrease in serum levels of PTH in PTH-KL2/2 mice of similar
magnitude as in wild-type mice.
FGF23 signaling pathway in the parathyroid glands of
PTH-KL2/2 mice
We next explored which signaling pathway might mediate the
inhibition by FGF23 on PTH secretion in PTH-KL2/2 mice.
Activation of the MAPK cascade was first examined using
immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Figure 3C, there was
significantly less immunostaining for phosphorylated ERK1/2 in
parathyroid tissue from PTH-KL2/2 mice, and a complete co￾localization with residual Klotho protein. These data indicate that
activation of the MAP kinase pathway by FGF23 is markedly
suppressed or absent in Klotho-deficient parathyroids.
We next tested whether the calcineurin-nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, another proposed downstream
signaling pathway of FGFR activation [16,17,18], was activated in
the parathyroids of PTH-KL2/2 mice in response to FGF23. To
this end, we analyzed gene expression of calcineurin and NFAT in
parathyroid tissue from wild-type mice. Indeed, all subunits of

calcineurin and all four calcium-regulated members of the NFAT
family (NFATC1–NFATC4) were expressed in the parathyroid of
wild-type mice (Figure 4A). We then examined by immunofluo￾rescence microscopy the subcellular distribution of the NFAT
proteins in parathyroid tissue from PTH-KL2/2 mice that had
been treated with FGF23. While parathyroid tissue from FGF23
treated wild-type mice showed cytoplasmic immunostaining for
NFATC2, the parathyroid tissue of FGF23 treated PTH-KL2/2
mice also showed nuclear localization of NFATC2 (Figure 4B). No
clear difference was seen for the other NFATs. In addition,
immunostaining analysis for the modulatory calcineurin interact￾ing protein 1 (MCIP1), a facilitator of calcineurin activity, revealed
that MCIP1 expression was markedly upregulated in Klotho￾deficient parathyroid tissue compared to wild-type tissue
(Figure 4B) [19]. Together, the data suggest that the calcineurin￾NFAT pathway is activated in the parathyroid of PTH-KL2/2
mice, and responds to treatment with FGF23.
To provide in vivo evidence for the role of the calcineurin-NFAT
pathway in mediating the suppression by FGF23 of PTH
secretion, PTH-KL2/2 and wild-type mice were pre-treated with
cyclosporine A (CsA), a calcineurin-inhibitor, prior to injection of
FGF23. As shown in Figures 4C and D, the CsA pre-treatment
nearly abolished the effect of FGF23 on PTH secretion in PTH￾KL2/2 mice, whereas it did not impact this FGF23 action in wild￾type mice.
To investigate whether the parathyroid calcineurin-NFAT
pathway acts independent of serum factors such as soluble Klotho,
thyro-parathyroid explants from wild-type and PTH-KL2/2 mice
were treated with FGF23 with or without pre-treatment of CsA
[20]. In explants without pretreatment of CsA, 2 h treatment with
FGF23 (10 ng/mL) decreased PTH secretion similarly in wild￾type and PTH-KL2/2 mice (Figure 4E). Conversely, in explants
pre-treated with CsA (0.83 mM) for 2 h the response to FGF23
treatment was unaltered in wild-type mice but completely blunted
in PTH-KL2/2 mice (DPTH relative to baseline; 0.81 vs 1.17,
p,0.01).
Discussion
Regulation of PTH secretion is a fundamental process in
calcium homeostasis, yet our current models are constantly revised
due to the complex and multi-dimensional control of PTH. Recent
data suggest that, in addition to calcium-sensing receptor and
vitamin D receptor activation, the FGF23-Klotho endocrine axis
negatively regulates PTH secretion. However, previous discordant
results of FGF23-Klotho function in physiology and in patho￾physiological states such as renal sHPT prompted us to further
investigate the concerted parathyroid action of FGF23-Klotho in
vivo. We addressed this issue by generating a novel mouse model
harboring a parathyroid-specific deletion of Klotho and our
principal findings are that i) absence of parathyroid Klotho does
not alter the acute parathyroid response of PTH secretion and
calcium sensitivity as previously suggested; ii) absence of parathy￾roid Klotho alone does not contribute to the development of renal
sHPT; iii) in the absence of parathyroid Klotho, the calcineurin￾NFAT pathway is constitutively active and mediates the suppres￾sion by FGF23 of PTH secretion. The activation of this
compensatory mechanism in Klotho-deficient parathyroids might
explain the lack of a hyperparathyroid phenotype in PTH-KL2/2
mice.
We postulated the existence of a Klotho-independent signaling
pathway of FGF23 in the parathyroids based on the findings that
PTH-KL2/2 mice had unaltered serum PTH levels, a intact
parathyroid response to FGF23 injections and that hyperparathy￾roidism was not aggravated in the setting of renal failure despite an
effective ablation of parathyroid Klotho and an apparent lack of
MAPK activation in response to FGF23. Because FGF23 was
recently shown to promote pathological growth of the myocardi￾um and proposed as a mediator of left ventricular hypertrophy
through calcineurin-dependent mechanisms [16], we speculated
that this pathway might also be activated by FGF23 in the
parathyroids. Indeed, there was a marked upregulation of the
calcineurin-modulator MCIP1 and a more prominent nuclear
localization of NFATC2 in PTH-KL2/2 mice treated with FGF23,
strongly supporting a compensatory activation of the calcineurin￾NFAT pathway. The functional importance of this pathway was
confirmed in vivo and ex vivo where pretreatment with the
calcineurin inhibitor CsA abolished the PTH response to FGF23
treatment in PTH-KL2/2 mice but not in wild-type mice.
Importantly, our data are also consistent with a previous report
demonstrating increased PTH transcript levels in calcineurin Ab
null mice and posttranslational regulation of PTH in vitro by CsA
[21]. The blunted PTH response to FGF23 injection in PTH-KL2/
2 mice indicates that parathyroid FGF23 signaling is dependent
on two principal pathways, Klotho-FGFR activation and calci￾neurin activation respectively. However, the exact intra-cellular
mechanisms mediating FGF23 suppression of PTH remain to be
defined. Importantly, the expression of FGFR1, which has been
implicated as the relevant FGFR for parathyroid FGF23 signaling,
was unaltered in PTH-KL2/2 mice. This supports that their
FGF23-driven calcineurin activation occurs without a compensa￾tory increase in its target FGFR.
The identification of a novel FGF23-calcineurin signaling
pathway in the parathyroid glands has several implications. First,
it challenges the current concepts of FGF23-mediated PTH
regulation and secretion. Second, it raises the possibility of
previously neglected Klotho-independent down-stream effects of
FGF23. This should be put in the context that abnormally high
levels of FGF23 in humans are associated with adverse clinical
outcomes including cardiovascular disease, CKD progression rate
and mortality [22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Indeed, FGF23 may con￾tribute to pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in a Klotho￾independent manner [16]. Future studies are warranted to explore
Klotho-independent FGF23 signaling at the systemic level.
Although FGF23 appears to signal independently of Klotho in
both parathyroid glands and cardiomyocytes [16] there is a
fundamental difference in its signaling in these tissues. In the heart,
FGF23 signaling is an ‘off-target’ effect in a non-classical,

were injected intravenously with recombinant FGF23 protein at the dose 0.15 mg/kg and blood samples from the tail vein were drawn after

PTH-KL2/2 mice despite ablated Klotho expression. Figure shows pooled data from two independent experiments (n = 9 for PTH-KL2/2; n = 7 for wild￾type mice). *p,0.05 C) The impact of Klotho-dependent FGF23 signaling was investigated in parathyroid glands with dual immunofluorescence
staining of Klotho and phosphorylated ERK1/2. Importantly, phosphorylated ERK1/2 was strongly induced 15 minutes after a single intravenous
FGF23 injection in wild-type mice. In contrast, PTH-KL2/2 mice failed to phosphorylate ERK1/2 specifically in cells lacking Klotho, supporting a
disruption of functional Klotho-mediated FGF23 signaling in PTH-KL2/2 mice (106and 406magnification).

non-Klotho expressing organ. In contrast, in parathyroid glands it
may rather be viewed as an ‘on-target’ effect in a Klotho￾expressing target organ which represents a paradigm shift in the
conceptual framework of FGF23 endocrine action.
SHPT is an inevitable complication in CKD patients with
advanced renal failure. Serum FGF23 concentrations rise in
parallel with a decline in glomerular filtration rate and are
markedly elevated at later stages of CKD [29]. Because PTH
stimulates FGF23 synthesis in bone and FGF23 signals back to the
parathyroids and suppresses PTH secretion [30], a reasonable
assumption is that FGF23 rises in CKD in part to counteract
sHPT. Indeed, rats subjected to parathyroidectomy prior to
induction of renal failure did not respond with increased FGF23
levels [30]. However, the unabated development of sHPT in the
face of extreme FGF23 elevations poses a dilemma: either the
inhibitory action of FGF23 on PTH is not relevant in vivo or the
parathyroids may lack responsiveness to FGF23 in CKD. The
latter option is supported by studies in CKD rat models
demonstrating an attenuated or abolished parathyroid response
to FGF23 [9,10]. Parathyroid FGF23 resistance corroborates data
showing a reduction in both Klotho and FGFRs in animal models
and in human-derived surgically resected hyperplastic parathyroid
glands [11,12]. Our data unequivocally support that parathyroid
FGF23 resistance is not primarily induced by Klotho insufficiency.
Speculatively, reduced expression of the cognate FGFR(s) could be
the principal mechanism underlying this phenomenon.
Another potentially relevant implication of our findings is that a
large portion of CKD patients receiving a renal allograft suffer
from persistent sHPT unproportional to their residual kidney
function in the face of high systemic FGF23 [31]. We speculate
that this might be due to a dual blocking of FGF23 signaling, both
through the endogenously decreased abundance of parathyroid
FGFRs/Klotho and the superimposed inhibition of the calci￾neurin-NFAT pathway by calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine
and tacrolimus) commonly used as immunosuppressive agents.
This hypothesis and the proposed role of parathyroid resident
Klotho is modeled in Figure 5.
The role of parathyroid Klotho remains controversial due to
previous conflicting data. Klotho was reported to modulate
parathyroid Na+
/K+
-ATPase activity via direct interaction with
its a1-subunit causing an increased abundance of plasma
membrane Na+
/K+
-ATPase, which in turn promotes PTH
secretion through an increased electrochemical gradient [7].
However, this mechanism was only functional at low extra-cellular
calcium concentrations and another study demonstrated that
blocking of the Na+
/K+
-ATPase with the digitalis glycoside
ouabain did not affect the PTH secretory response to acute
hypocalcemia [8]. This study underscores that parathyroid Klotho
does not alter parathyroid sensitivity to acute fluctuations in serum
calcium.
Given the apparent normal phenotype of PTH-KL2/2 mice and
their intact response to FGF23 it remains uncertain what other
functions parathyroid Klotho may have. The cause of increased
serum 1,25(OH)2D in PTH-KL2/2 mice is unknown since
expression levels of Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 are unaltered in kidneys

Figure 5. Proposed model of FGF23-Klotho function in parathyroid glands. FGF23 is an endocrine ligand that in the parathyroid glands
either binds to an FGF-receptor and membrane-bound Klotho, to elicit activation of the MAPK-pathway, or acts via a calcineurin-dependent signaling
pathway. Both pathways induce a rapid inhibition of PTH secretion within 15 minutes. The MAPK-pathway is likely the dominant pathway in
physiology, although their relative contributions are unknown. In addition to mediating MAPK-dependent FGF23 signaling, Klotho may play an
intrinsic role in modulating parathyroid transcriptional activity for sustained demands and long-term parathyroid function. Speculatively, the clinical
use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNi) that block calcineurin signaling may increase the susceptibility to develop, or aggravate pre-existing,
hyperparathyroidism in patients with reduced Klotho level such as in chronic kidney disease and primary hyperparathyroidism.

Parathyroid FGF23-Klotho Signaling

to normalizing PTH and counteracts development of hyperpara￾thyroidism. Further, we speculate that Klotho is an important local
transcriptional regulator of genes involved in sustained challenge
of parathyroid function or having a long-term impact on
parathyroid function. In support of this idea, PTH-KL2/2 mice
had altered transcript levels of several transcriptional regulators
including Cfd, Smad4, Fabp4 and Pin1. The increased level of Pin1
in PTH-KL2/2 mice is intriguing given its role in destabilizing
PTH mRNA [32] and may represent yet another protective
intracellular mechanism against hyperparathyroidism when
FGF23-Klotho signaling is chronically disrupted.
In sum, we dissected the physiological and pathophysiological
role of parathyroid Klotho and elucidated several critical and
novel aspects in this regard. Most importantly, our study
uncovered a Klotho-independent FGF23 signaling mechanism in
parathyroid glands with potential implications for multiple
disorders of mineral metabolism, especially in CKD.
Materials and Methods
Generation of parathyroid-specific Klotho knockout mice
Mice with a parathyroid-specific Klotho deletion were gener￾ated using Cre-Lox recombination as previously described [33].
Briefly, loxP sequences were introduced in the flanking regions of
exon 2 of the Klotho gene. Floxed mice were crossed with mice
expressing Cre recombinase under the human PTH promotor
(129;FVB-Tg(PTH-cre)4167Slib/J; Jackson laboratory, US) and
the offspring subsequently analyzed. Floxed littermates not
expressing Cre were used as wild-type controls.
Genotyping
Total DNA was extracted from tail biopsies and genotyping
performed with standard PCR techniques.
Animal housing
Mice were fed a standard chow (RM1, SDS, UK) containing
0.73% calcium and 0.52% phosphorous. All animals had free
access to food and drinking water. Blood sampling was performed
by tail vein incision at intermediate time points and through the
axillary artery at sacrifice. Animals were fasted 4 hour prior to
blood sampling. All experiments were conducted in compliance
with the guidelines of animal experiments at Karolinska Institutet
and approved by the regional ethical board (Stockholm South
ethical committee).
Serum and urine biochemistries
Calcium, phosphorous and creatinine were measured using
quantitative colorimetric assay kits (BioChain, US). Urine values
were multiplied by 1000. Serum PTH was measured using a
Mouse Intact PTH ELISA kit (Immutopics, US). For the FGF23
injection experiments the newer Mouse 1–84 PTH ELISA kit
(Immutopics) and plasma samples were used. Serum 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D was measured using a RIA kit (IDS, US).
Intact FGF23 was measured using an FGF23 ELISA kit (Kainos
Laboratories, Japan).
RNA isolation and transcript analysis
Parathyroid glands and surrounding adhesive thyroid tissue
were carefully removed in conjunction with sacrifice and
immediately frozen in OCT. The parathyroid tissue was then
dissected using laser capture microdissection. Thirty mm thick
cryo-sections were cut and mounted on PEN foil–coated slides
(Leica, Germany). Sections were stained with the Arcturus
histogene kit (Applied Biosystems, US) and microdissected with a
Leica ASLMD microscope (Leica). Total RNA was extracted by
the Arcturus picopure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems). The
nanostring nCounter system (Nanostring technologies, US) was
used to obtain mRNA expression profiles. Data were processed
using several normalization strategies, including quantile normal￾ization and 6 house-keeping genes.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Thyro-parathyroid tissue were dissected, fixed in 4% parafor￾maldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 4 mm sections were
immersed in 3% H2O2 in methanol, treated with 4% normal
serum and blocked with Avidin and Biotin (Vector Laboratories,
US). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4uC
overnight. For immunohistochemistry slides were incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by Vector ABC
Reagent and developed with DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories).
For immunofluorescence, Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary
antibodies were used for visualization (Invitrogen, US). The
primary antibodies used were rat monoclonal anti-Klotho
(KM2076, TransGenic Inc. Japan) mouse monoclonal anti-CaSR
(NB120-19347, Novus Biologicals, US), mouse monoclonal anti￾VDR (sc-13133, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, US), rabbit mono￾clonal anti-Ki67 (SP6, Thermo Scientific, US), rabbit monoclonal
anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling, US), mouse
monoclonal anti-NFATc2 (sc-7295, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and rabbit polyclonal anti-MCIP1 (a kind gift from Dr. Christian
Faul) [34].
Bone phenotyping
Processing of undecalcified bone specimens and cancellous bone
histology in the distal femoral metaphysis were performed
according to standard protocols. The area within 0.25 mm from
the growth plate was excluded from the measurements. mCT were
performed using a Scanco Medical mCT 35 system (Scanco,
Switzerland).
Determination of parathyroid calcium sensitivity
Investigation of the PTH-calcium relationship was performed
by intraperitoneal injections with calcium-gluconate (300 mmol/
kg) or EGTA (450 mmol/kg) dissolved in sterile saline as described
elsewhere [14]. Blood samples were collected from tail vein for
serum PTH and calcium measurements after 30 minutes.
Induction of renal failure
We employed an adenine-based model of renal failure in which
mice were given adenine mixed in a casein containing diet. Mice
were exposed to 0.3% adenine during the first 7 days followed by
0.2% adenine for 11 days, and finally 0.1% adenine for the rest of
the study. Adenine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (US), and
the powdered casein-based diet from Special Diets Services.
Intravenous injections of FGF23 and pretreatment with
CsA
Recombinant human FGF23 protein (A28 to I251) was
produced as previously described [35,36]. In all experiments,
FGF23 was injected intravenously through the tail vein after a 4-
hour fasting period at the dose 0.15 mg/kg dissolved in 300 ml
saline. Blood samples were drawn 15 min after injection of
FGF23, and the animals were then sacrificed and thyro￾parathyroid tissue immediately excised and fixed in 4% formalin
for further analysis. Mice were gavage fed with CsA at the dose
60–150 mg/kg (Sigma-Aldrich) two hours prior to FGF23
injection.

Organ culture
During anesthesia the trachea was severed superiorly and
inferiorly to the thyroid gland. The trachea-thyro-parathyroid
complex was excised and placed in 1 ml serum-free medium
(DMEM/F-12, HEPES supplemented with insulin, transferrin and
BSA) as previously described [20]. Medium was replaced daily for
4 days before the experiment started, in accordance with the
protocol by Ritter et al. On day 4 fresh medium was added and
the tissue incubated for 2 h ( = baseline). The medium was then
replaced with regular medium ( = control) or medium containing
10 ng/mL FGF23 and incubated for 2 h. One group was pre￾treated with medium containing CsA (0.83 mM) for 2 h prior to
incubation with FGF23. All values were calculated as relative
change compared to baseline.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, US) was used for
statistical analysis. Variables were tested with either two-tailed t￾test or Mann-Whitney test. Correlations between serum PTH and
calcium levels were tested with linear regression analysis.
