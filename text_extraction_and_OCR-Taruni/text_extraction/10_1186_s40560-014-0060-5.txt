Role of prothrombin complex concentrate in
perioperative coagulation therapy
Kenichi A Tanaka1*, Michael Mazzeffi1 and Miroslav Durila2
Abstract
Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is a term to describe pharmacological products that contain lyophilized,
human plasma-derived vitamin K-dependent factors (F), FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and various amounts of proteins C and S. PCCs
can be rapidly reconstituted in a small volume (20 ml for about 500 international units (IU)) at bedside and administered
regardless of the patient’s blood type. PCCs are categorized as 4-factor PCC if they contain therapeutic amounts of
FVII, and 3-factor PCC when FVII content is low. In addition, activated PCC which contains activated FVII and FX with
prothrombin is available for factor VIII bypassing therapy in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Currently, 4-factor PCC
is approved for the management of bleeding in patients taking warfarin, but there has been increasing use of various
PCCs in the treatment of acquired perioperative coagulopathy unrelated to warfarin therapy and in the management
of bleeding due to novel oral anticoagulants. There is also an ongoing controversy about plasma transfusion and
its potential hazards including transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI). Early fixed ratio plasma transfusion has been
implemented in many trauma centers in the USA, whereas fibrinogen concentrate and PCC are preferred over
plasma transfusion in some European centers.
In this review, the rationales for including PCCs in the perioperative hemostatic management will be discussed in
conjunction with plasma transfusion.

Introduction
Clinical management of severe bleeding in surgery and
after trauma remains a major challenge. Transfusions of
allogeneic platelets and plasma are widely used to replace
cellular and humoral components of coagulation. These
allogeneic products appear to be lifesaving when they are
utilized early in the massive transfusion protocol in which
more than six to ten units of packed red blood cells
(RBCs) are typically administered in 12–24 h [1-3]. On the
other hand, large amounts of allogeneic plasma have been
associated with both infectious and non-infectious trans￾fusion complications, which negatively impact patient sur￾vival [3-5].
Plasma-derived and recombinant factor concentrates
are the lyophilized form of specific factor(s) indicated
mainly for hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies [6].
The use of these factor concentrates in perioperative pa￾tients without hereditary coagulation disorders has been
increasingly reported in anecdotal case series, retrospect￾ive, and prospective clinical studies [7,8]. Off-label use of
recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been ram￾pant in the management of severe perioperative bleeding
until several key clinical trials failed to improve outcomes
and suggested a potential increase in thrombotic compli￾cations [9]. More recently, the FDA has approved the use
of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) with thera￾peutic amounts of vitamin K-dependent factors for the
management of bleeding in patients treated with warfarin
[10]. For the latter, prothrombin, FVII, FIX, and FX are
the specific ‘targets’ of PCC for replacement. Conversely,
if plasma is used to reverse warfarin, multiple unnecessary
elements are infused into the patient including albumin,
antithrombin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, etc. Clinical
indications, efficacies, and potential complications of
plasma and factor concentrates should be carefully consid￾ered before they are applied to correct bleeding diathesis.

Further, it is important to understand the mechanism of
action of hemostatic agents and their impact on coagula￾tion tests so that inappropriate dosing can be avoided.
The goal of this review is to discuss current limitations
of plasma transfusion, pharmacology of PCCs, and their
potential roles in surgical and trauma settings.
Review
Limitations of plasma
In the USA, two types of plasma are generally used for
transfusion: fresh frozen plasma (FFP; plasma frozen
within 8 h) and frozen plasma (FP24; plasma frozen at
8–24 h after collection). Once thawed, FFP and FP24
can be kept in the refrigerator (1°C–6°C) for 5 days,
which potentially reduces plasma wastage and increases
the inventories of group AB (universal) or group A
plasma for emergency transfusion [11]. Although this
has become a standard practice at large tertiary care
centers in the North America, thawed plasma products
may not be an option in smaller hospitals [12] and in
other countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) [13].
Coagulation factor levels except for FVIII appear to
stable for 5–7 days after thawing as long as plasma bags
are kept at 1°C–6°C [13-15]. FVIII is most labile, and its
activity falls by approximately 40% in 5 days. Some
thawed plasma units (particularly group O plasma) may
contain FVIII levels below 50% at the time of adminis￾tration [14]. However, this is unlikely to have any clinical
consequence because FVIII levels are often normal or el￾evated in most surgical and trauma patients [16,17].
Anticoagulant levels including antithrombin (AT) and
protein C are also preserved, but protein S is decreased
to 50% in 5-day old thawed plasma [13].
Although coagulation factor levels remain relatively
stable in thawed plasma compared to FFP and FP24,
there is a significant variability (50%–150%) in factor
levels among individual donors [18,19]. For example,
consider a case where one unit of plasma (250 ml) is be￾ing transfused to an 80-kg patient who currently has
prothrombin activity of 20% (20 IU/dl). Assuming a
plasma volume of 50 ml/kg, total amount of prothrom￾bin in this patient is equal to:
80 kg  50 ml=kg  0:2 IU=ml ¼ 800 IU
If the donor plasma contains 80% prothrombin activity
(80 IU/dl), the transfused amount of prothrombin is:
250 ml × 0.8 IU/ml =200 IU.
Thus, after transfusion (assuming 100% recovery), total
prothrombin activity is:
ð Þ 800 þ 200 IU=ð Þ 4; 000 þ 250 ml ¼ 23:5 IU=dl 23 ð Þ :5%
If four units of the same plasma are transfused, total
prothrombin activity becomes:
ð Þ 800 þ 200  4 IU = ð Þ 4; 000 þ 250  4 ml
¼ 32:0 IU=dl 32% ð Þ
Similarly, if four units of another donor plasma with
120% prothrombin activity were transfused, total pro￾thrombin activity becomes:
ð Þ 800 þ 300  4 IU = ð Þ 4; 000 þ 250  4 ml
¼ 40:0IU=dl 40% ð Þ
Thus, plasma prothrombin activity is expected to be
higher after the latter set of plasma, but normal pro￾thrombin level above 50% is not achieved in this patient
at the end of plasma transfusion (12.5 ml/kg). Indeed, it
was previously reported that 30 ml/kg of plasma were
needed to achieve 30% increase in procoagulant factor
levels in critically ill patients with bleeding [20]. Large
volumes of plasma transfusion increase not only the risk
of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
but also the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury
(TRALI), a potentially lethal complication of plasma
transfusion [21]. The pathogenesis of TRALI presumably
involves leukocyte agglutination in pulmonary capillaries,
which is triggered by donor antibodies against the recipi￾ent’s human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and neutrophil￾specific antigens (HNA). Multiparous females are often
sensitized to HLA antigens, and the recent switch to the
preferential use male donor plasma has significantly re￾duced the incidence of TRALI to 1:12,000 [22]. However,
in the emergency setting, about 40% of AB plasma is still
from female donors, and the risk of TRALI is presumably
higher [23]. It is also common to use ABO-compatible
plasma, which is not identical to the recipient’s ABO
group in the case of massive transfusion. In the retrospect￾ive matched cohort study of 568 trauma patients, the use
of ABO-compatible plasma was dose-dependently associ￾ated with increased risks of acute respiratory distress syn￾drome and sepsis compared to the use of ABO-identical
plasma [5].
Taken together, plasma transfusion should be imple￾mented in the early phase of resuscitation for massive
hemorrhage when bleeding sites are unknown, or no
surgical control of bleeding has been achieved. Large
volumes of required plasma (15–30 ml/kg) are usually
tolerated because of hypovolemia due to hemorrhage.
The risks of TRALI and other complications are theoret￾ically increased after the exposure to multiple plasma
units and donor antibodies. Newer commercial plasma
products such as solvent-detergent plasma appear to
have a minimal TRALI risk (i.e., anti-HLA/anti-granulo￾cyte antibodies are significantly diluted by pooling of
plasma from approximately 1,500 donors) [24], but it
has not been widely used in the North America.

PCCs versus plasma in acute warfarin reversal
PCC is a term used for lyophilized, human plasma￾derived vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor concen￾trate. There are a number of commercial PCC products,
and their availability varies among countries. According
to the contents of coagulation factors, they are catego￾rized into three groups: 4-factor PCC, 3-factor PCC, and
activated PCC (Table 1).
The FDA approval of 4-factor PCC for acute warfarin
reversal was based on the multicenter prospective ran￾domized study of Kcentra® (CSL Behring, Marburg,
Germany) and FFP in warfarin-treated adult patients
(international normalized ratio (INR) >2.0) undergoing
urgent surgery or invasive procedure [10]. This study
demonstrated important differences in clinical endpoints
and hematological parameters between 4-factor PCC
and FFP. First, clinical hemostasis over 24 h with 4-
factor PCC was non-inferior to FFP (72.4% vs. 65.4%, re￾spectively). However, the median volume of infusion was
much less for PCC than FFP (99.4 vs. 813.5 ml, respect￾ively). Secondly, the target INR of ≤1.3 was reached after
30 min of intervention in 62.2% of patients treated with
4-factor PCC versus only in 9.6% of FFP-treated patients.
It is also important to point out that the median time
required to complete the treatment was much less for
PCC than FFP (17.0 vs. 148 min, respectively).
Lastly, rapid recoveries of plasma vitamin K factor
levels were clearly demonstrated within 30 min after in￾fusing 4-factor PCC, while it took at least 3 h for plasma
transfusion (and vitamin K) to bring procoagulant levels
to ≥50% [10]. In particular, prothrombin (FII) and FX
were recovered to 80%–100% of normal activity and
maintained for 24 h with 4-factor PCC compared to
plasma (Figure 1). Initial recoveries of FVII and FIX to
60%–80% were also better for 4-factor PCC than for
plasma transfusion, but no difference between PCC and
plasma was observed after 12 h.
3-factor PCC and activated PCC (factor eight bypassing
agent; FEIBA) are specifically indicated for the prevention
and treatment of hemophilia-related bleeding. However,
3-factor PCC is rarely used for this indication because hu￾man plasma-derived and recombinant FIX are available
for hemophilia B. The use of 3-factor PCC for acute war￾farin reversal has been reported prior to the approval of 4-
factor PCC [24-27]. When INR values are very high (>5.0),
3-factor PCC is less effective than 4-factor PCC because
FVII content is subtherapeutic in 3-factor PCC [24,28].
However, 3-factor PCC appears to be hemostatically
effective due to high contents of FX and prothrombin
[25-27]. Activated PCC (FEIBA) contains non-activated
FII, FIX, and FX as well as trace amounts of FVIIa and
FXa [29]. This agent is used in hemophilia patients with
neutralizing antibodies to FVIII or FIX. The off-label use
of FEIBA (500–1,000 IU) was shown to be more effective
than 2–4 units of FFP in acute warfarin reversal [30].
The manufacturing process of PCCs from pooled hu￾man plasma includes pathogen reduction steps to pre￾vent the transmission of lipid-enveloped viruses. These
steps are solvent detergent exposure, pasteurization in
the aqueous phase, or exposure of lyophilized product
to vapor heat. There is a remaining concern for the
transmissions of non-lipid enveloped, heat-resistant
viruses including parvovirus B19 or variant Creutzfeldt￾Jakob disease (vCJD; bovine spongiform encephalop￾athy (BSE)), and other emerging pathogens, but strict
donor screening, nanofiltration of the source plasma,
and inventory hold should sufficiently lower the risk of
such transmissions [31].

PCCs in acquired, non-warfarin coagulopathy
The FDA-approved indication for 4-factor PCC is limited
to warfarin-related bleeding, but a number of publications
have described the use of PCCs in acquired, non-warfarin
coagulopathy in major trauma and surgery [32-35]. In con￾trast to warfarin anticoagulation in which only vitamin K￾dependent factors are affected, perioperative coagulopathy
often involves deficiencies of multiple coagulation factors
and inhibitors. Multifactorial coagulation defects including
thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperfibrino￾lysis are important conditions that potentially decrease the
efficacy of PCCs. These conditions can be quickly assessed
by the use of whole blood viscoelastic tests. Thromboelas￾tography (TEG®; Haemoscope-Haemonetics, Niles, IL) and
thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, Durham, NC) are com￾mercially available viscoelastic monitoring devices. Clot
formation is assessed by the tensile (viscoelastic) force be￾tween the cup and the immersed pin resulting from the
interaction between polymerizing fibrin and activated
platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors during en￾dogenous thrombin generation and, if any, fibrin degrad￾ation by plasmin (Figure 2) [36].
In a retrospective study of 131 trauma patients (in￾jury severity score, 38 ± 15), Schöchl et al. utilized a
thromboelastometry-based protocol to initially restore
fibrinogen to 150–200 mg/dl (target fibrinogen throm￾boelastometry [FIBTEMMCF >10 mm]) and then corrected
slow blood coagulation (i.e., enzymatic defect) by adminis￾tering 4-factor PCC (target extrinsic thromboelastometry
[EXTEMCT ≤80 s]) [32]. Fibrinogen concentrate (median,
6 g or approximately 75.9 mg/kg) and 4-factor PCC (me￾dian, 1,800 IU or approximately 22.8 IU/kg) were respect￾ively used in 96.2% and 73.7% of the subjects. On the other
hand, platelet and plasma transfusions were given in 21.8%
and 9.0% of the subjects, respectively. The overall mortality
rate was 24.4%, which was considered to be lower than pre￾dicted mortalities (28%–34%) based on the injury scales.
In cardiac surgery with a moderate to high risk of post￾operative bleeding, Weber et al. recently demonstrated
that thromboelastometry-guided hemostatic intervention
(n =50) was superior to the transfusion guided by con￾ventional coagulation tests (control, n =50) [34]. In the
intervention group, 4-factor PCC (25 IU/kg) was ad￾ministered in the presence of slow blood coagulation
(EXTEMCT >80 s) and normal fibrin formation (FIB￾TEMA10 > 10 mm), while in the control group, plasma
or PCC was given if INR >1.4 or after four units of
RBCs were transfused when INR was unavailable. The
overall use of PCC was similar between the two groups
(44% vs. 52% in the control; P =0.433), but the incidence
of plasma transfusion was significantly decreased in the
intervention group (40% vs. 80% in the control; P <0.001).
Similarly, there are two studies involving the deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest, which demonstrated
that plasma usage could be significantly decreased by
thromboelastometry-guided hemostatic intervention
compared to the conventional transfusion. Girdauskas
et al. reported that incidences of plasma, fibrinogen,
and 4-factor PCC usages (thromboelastometry vs. con￾trol) were 33% vs. 86% (P <0.001), 78% vs. 90% (P =0.7),

and 15% vs. 90% (P <0.001) in aortic surgery (n =56)
[37]. Similarly, Fassl et al. reported that plasma usage
was 33% in the thromboelastometry group compared to
65% in the control (P =0.005) while there was no differ￾ence in the use of fibrinogen and 4-factor PCC between
the two groups in aortic surgery [35]. Although sample
sizes were relatively small (n ≤100) in the three cardiac
surgery studies mentioned above, in-hospital adverse
events including surgical reexploration, myocardial
infarction, renal impairment, stroke, and death did not
appear to be increased by the thromboelastometry￾based intervention. In general, the overall incidence
of PCC-related thromboembolic complications was re￾ported to be 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8–2.1) in a recent meta￾analysis of 27 studies (1,032 patients) including both 3-
factor and 4-factor PCCs for the reversal of vitamin K
antagonists [38]. Taken together, the abovementioned
trauma and cardiac surgery studies suggested that fac￾tor concentrates can be effectively combined with allo￾geneic components using thromboelastometry-based
protocols, resulting in reduced plasma transfusion [39].
Reversal of novel oral anticoagulant
The use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is rapidly
growing as an alternative to warfarin in venous throm￾boprophylaxis or stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial
fibrillation. The direct thrombin inhibitor (anti-IIa),
dabigatran, and the direct Xa inhibitor (anti-Xa) includ￾ing rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are prescribed
without the need for coagulation testing. However, the
lack of direct antidotes makes it difficult to manage their
bleeding complications and to urgently reverse their ef￾fect for invasive procedures. Although there are specific
neutralizing agents for anti-IIa and anti-Xa agents in
clinical development [40,41], physicians presently strug￾gle with managing bleeding complications of NOACs,
particularly of dabigatran [42-45]. The use of rFVIIa
and PCCs are considered to mitigate NOAC-associated
bleeding, and they have been tested in animal and
preclinical studies [46,47]. However, there are few data
to support their clinical applicability. A case of massive
transfusion related to dabigatran was reported in a pa￾tient undergoing aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass surgery. An extremely high-dose rFVIIa
(21.6 mg or 270 μg/kg) was used in parallel with large
amounts of blood products (plasma 22 units, cryopre￾cipitate 50 units, and platelets 5 adult doses), and bleed￾ing was reported to be decreased. Hemostasis was finally
achieved after several hours of hemodialysis for dabiga￾tran removal. Another dabigatran-associated bleeding
was reported after a cardiac perforation during an
attempted atrial fibrillation ablation. Hypotension due to
cardiac tamponade required epinephrine infusion, 8 l of
fluid administration, six units of RBCs, and two units of
FFP. After more than 4.5 l of blood was drained via peri￾cardiocentesis, activated PCC (FEIBA, 26 U/kg) was
intravenously given, and “notable slowing of bleeding”
was observed by the cardiologist. Epinephrine infusion
was subsequently stopped. There was another episode of
hypotension 30 h after the procedure, the second dose
of activated PCC (16 U/kg) was administered for sus￾pected bleeding, and no thrombotic complication was
observed. In vitro studies in human plasma suggest that
both rFVIIa (120 μg/kg equivalent) and activated PCC
(40–160 U/kg equivalent) improve the initiation of
thrombin generation which is delayed by dabigatran
[48]. Dabigatran-induced delayed thrombin generation
was not improved by 4-factor PCC in human plasma
[48,49], but several in vivo animal bleeding models
support the use of 4-factor and 3-factor PCCs [50,51].
There are conflicting data regarding the use of PCCs in
rivaroxaban-induced bleeding [52-54]. Taken together,
Figure 2 Basic tracing patterns. Changes in whole blood viscoelasticity are detected electromechanically in TEG® and optically in ROTEM®, and
clot formation parameters are generated on TEG® (top) and ROTEM® (bottom). Plasmatic coagulation is reflected on R time and CT, initial clot
development is shown on K time or CFT (also on α angle), and maximal viscoelasticity is defined by maximum amplitude (MA) or maximum clot
firmness (MCF) for TEG® and ROTEM®, respectively. Systemic fibrinolysis is suspected when clot breakdown (>15% of MA or MCF) is observed
within 1 h.

the use of rFVIIa, PCC, and activated PCC may at least
partially improve hemostasis in the presence of NOACs,
but there is a paucity of clinical data to suggest a specific
agent and dose. It is recommended that an emergency
protocol for NOAC-associated bleeding is established at
each institution by combining supportive measures and
pharmacological interventions [55].
Selecting plasma versus PCC in complex bleeding
conditions
Clinical evidence and data supporting the use of factor
concentrates in acquired coagulopathy have been increas￾ing, but choosing this approach over plasma transfusion
depends heavily on the clinical context. Although certain
coagulation factors may be rapidly replenished by factor
concentrates, they can be depleted again if there is no
surgical control of bleeding. Durila and Malosek recently
described the case of a 33-year-old woman who suffered
from multiple traumatic injuries (ISS, 59) after a motor
vehicle collision [56]. This patient required endotracheal
intubation in the field and was brought to the hospital in
hemorrhagic shock (pH 7.0, base excess −18.5 mmol/l)
requiring norepinephrine to sustain blood pressure (70/
40 mmHg). The obvious injury sites were an occipital open
cranial wound and open fracture of the left thigh. In
addition, free fluid was detected in the peritoneal cavity by
ultrasound. The initial thromboelastometry traces showed
delayed coagulation (EXTEMCT 112 s; normal 35–80 s),
late fibrinolysis on EXTEM, and borderline fibrinogen
(FIBTEMMCF 7 mm; normal 9–25 mm) (Figure 3A). The
initial hemostatic intervention included 2 g of tranexamic
acid, 4 g of fibrinogen (Haemocomplettan, CSL Behring,
Germany), and four units of FFP and RBCs. The 1:1 ratio
transfusion of FFP and RBCs was continued while
intraabdominal and intracranial bleeding sources were
sought and repaired by the surgical team. After an hour,
the repeat thromboelastometry showed delayed coagula￾tion (EXTEMCT 114 s), thrombocytopenia (EXTEMMCF
35 mm; normal 53–72 mm), and hypofibrinogenemia
(FIBTEMMCF 5 mm) (Figure 3B). The complex coagu￾lopathy was managed with 1,200 units of 4-factor PCC
(Prothromplex Total; Baxter, Austria), four units of ran￾dom donor platelets, and an additional 4 g of fibrinogen.
The combined hemostatic therapies normalized throm￾boelastometry parameters (Figure 3C,D), but the patient
remained hemodynamically unstable, requiring continued
norepinephrine infusion. This prompted the care team to
look for another source of surgical bleeding, and splenic
bleeding and intracranial bleeding sites were newly found
by the contrast-enhanced computed tomography. After
these were repaired, the patient became stable. Over the
course of 8 h, 30 units of RBCs, 26 units of FFP, four units
of platelets, 1,200 IU of PCC, and 10 g of fibrinogen were
administered to this patient. In the end, the authors
reported a favourable outcome of this case including no
neurological deficit and no acute lung or kidney injury
associated with blood transfusion [56]. Perioperative use
of fibrinogen-rich components such as cryoprecipitate or
fibrinogen concentrate has not been commonly used in
Japan since plasma-derived (unheated) fibrinogen concen￾trate was recalled over hepatitis outbreak in the late 1980s
[57]. However, Yamamoto et al. recently reported that the
off-label use of (pathogen-inactivated) fibrinogen concen￾trate (n =25) in thoracic aortic replacement to maintain
plasma fibrinogen level of 150 mg/dl was associated with a
58% reduction in the overall requirements for RBCs, FFP,
and platelets when compared to the age-matched histor￾ical control (n =24) in which FFP and platelets were the
only hemostatic measures [58]. Perioperative use of fi￾brinogen replacement can be considered as an adjunct to
plasma transfusion, and the dosing can be optimized by
fibrin-specific viscoelastic testing (Figure 3).
It may be argued that crystalloid and/or colloid should
have been used in a complex perioperative bleeding case
until surgical hemostasis is achieved instead of using
allogeneic plasma. However, a large amount of crystal￾loid or colloid progressively worsens coagulation by dilu￾tional effects [59] and possibly results in endothelial
damage, tissue edema, and fluid overload [60]. Further,
not all the coagulation factors and inhibitors can be
replenished by currently available factor concentrates.
Indeed, multiple microcapillary thrombi (in the lungs)
and the signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) were observed in four out of nine animals (44%)
after a high dose (50 IU/kg) of 4-factor PCC (Cofact;
Sanquin, Netherlands) in the presence of hepatic injury
and hemodilution (70% of blood volume replacement)
[61]. In their study, all nine animals that received a
lower dose (35 IU/kg) of PCC had improved hemostasis
(without DIC) and survival compared to the placebo￾treated control animals. A fatal thrombosis in the left
ventricle was reported in another porcine hepatic injury
model with hemodilution (60%–70% of blood volume
replacement) after coadministration of 200 mg/kg of
fibrinogen (Haemocomplettan; CSL Behring, Germany)
and 35 IU/kg of 4-factor PCC (Beriplex; CSL Behring,
Germany) [62]. These preclinical data suggest that anti￾coagulant contents in 4-factor PCCs (mainly protein C
and protein S) may be inadequate to reestablish the bal￾ance of procoagulant and anticoagulant elements in the
setting of severe hemodilution (>70% of blood volume
replacement). The 1:1 ratio transfusion of FFP and RBCs
may not result in the establishment of hemostasis in the
presence of massive bleeding. However, it is speculated
that transfused plasma prevents excessive hemodilution
of procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins [63,64], mak￾ing subsequent procoagulant interventions (PCC and
rFVIIa) more effective and less thrombogenic [65].

Conclusions
The goal of hemostasis is to establish adequate fibrin
polymerization at the site of vascular injury in a timely
fashion. Hemostatic processes are obviously complex,
involving vascular, humoral, and cellular components
[66]. Perioperative coagulopathy often involves multi￾factorial defects in vascular (e.g., surgical bleeding),
humoral, and cellular components. Transfusion algorithms
based on thromboelastometry have become popular be￾cause this viscoelastic testing shows the extent of fibrin
polymerization and the contributions of thrombin gene￾ration and platelet numbers to clot formation [36,67].
Timely diagnosis and therapeutic interventions are pivotal
in restoring hemostatic function and hemodynamic stabil￾ity in critically ill patients after trauma and major surgery
[68]. The uses of PCCs and fibrinogen concentrate have
advantages over allogeneic plasma in its rapid availability
and restoration of target factor(s) and lower risks for vol￾ume overload and TRALI [10,69]. However, there should
be a careful consideration in the dosing of PCCs because
the risk of thrombosis may be enhanced in a subset of
trauma and surgical patients [70] due to circulating tissue
factor [17] and decreased plasma or endothelial anticoagu￾lant activity [71]. In the early phase of hemostatic therapy
after massive hemorrhage, plasma transfusion can be used
to sustain procoagulant and anticoagulant factor levels.
Once surgically correctable bleeding sites are found and
nearly repaired, factor concentrate therapy can be imple￾mented to optimize thrombin generation and fibrin
polymerization under the guidance of thromboelastome￾try. In many countries, perioperative uses of PCCs and fi￾brinogen are considered as ‘off-label,’ but accumulating
clinical data indicate that they are useful adjuncts in the
management of preoperative coagulation.

Figure 3 Examples of rotational thromboelastometric tracings. (A) Pre-treatment: traces obtained from a bleeding patient who incurred
major trauma. Prolonged clotting time (CT) and late clot breakdown are notable on EXTEM. Fibrinogen level was on the borderline based on
FIBTEM. Laboratory coagulation results were shown, but these results were not reported until the second ROTEM measurements were completed.
Normal ranges for EXTEM and FIBTEM are as follows: EXTEM-CT 42–74 s, A10 43–65 mm, and MCF 49–71 mm; FIBTEM-A10 9–24 mm, MCF 9–25 mm.
(B) On treatment: traces obtained after the initial treatment with 2 g of tranexamic acid and 4 g of fibrinogen along with ongoing 1:1 transfusion
of RBCs and plasma. No improvement was seen in CT and MCF values of EXTEM. Fibrin polymerization was worsened on FIBTEM. (C) Normalized
coagulation: traces obtained after the combined therapies using 1,200 IU of 4-factor PCC, 2 g of fibrinogen, and four units of platelets. Despite normal
traces of EXTEM and FIBTEM, bleeding continued, and additional surgical hemostasis was established over the course of 8 h. The combination of
allogeneic blood products and factor concentrates was crucial for managing massive volume depletion and ongoing bleeding. (D) Dosing of factor
concentrates: the dose calculations for PCC and fibrinogen concentrate used in the protocol. BW = body weight. Adapted from the reference [56] with
