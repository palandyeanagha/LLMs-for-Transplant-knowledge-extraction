Perinatal hepatitis B virus infection caused
by antihepatitis Be positive maternal
mononuclear cells

Abstract
To investigate the infectivity of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) from mothers to their newborn
offspring, HBV-DNA in plasma and periphe￾ral mononuclear cells from 28 antihepatitis
Be positive, hepatitis B surface antigen posi￾tive carrier mothers was examined by a highly
sensitive polymerase chain reaction/Southern
hybridisation technique. HBV specific DNA
was detected in three maternal mononuclear
cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two
of four infants born to the three mothers with
HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells de￾veloped acute or fulminant hepatitis within
three months after birth. Two infants were
effectively prevented from infection with HBV
by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/
HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants
born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were
free of HBV infection within the next seven
months to 3-5 years. These results suggest
that latent infection with HBV in maternal
mononuclear cells is responsible for perinatal
HBV infection.

Since the establishment of the national project
for prevention of mother to infant transmission
of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with hepatitis B
immunoglobulin (HBIg) and HBV vaccine,
approximately 90-95% of the offspring of hepa￾titis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive HBV carrier
mothers acquired protection from perinatal
infection in Japan.1 2 In contrast, prophylaxis is
not recommended for infants of HBeAg nega￾tive mothers, who comprise three quarters of
pregnant hepatitis B carriers. About 10% of
infants born to such mothers are reported to
develop acute or fulminant hepatitis.3 As half of
the cases of infantile fulminant hepatitis are due
to perinatal HBV infection, and because most
mothers of these patients are HBeAg negative,
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive
carriers,3 protective measures for these infants
are urgently needed.
Although the infectivity of HBV is conventio￾nally monitored by noting the presence of
HBeAg and by measuring the activity of HBV
specific DNA polymerase, recent advances in
molecular hybridisation technology have pro￾vided more sensitive markers of HBV
infection.4 5 HBV-DNA can be detected even in
anti-HBe positive sera,6 and regardless of
HBeAg status, the quantity of circulating HBV￾DNA is directly related to HBV infectivity and
to the activity of chronic liver disease.7 8
However, any mechanisms of HBV transmis￾sion from HBeAg negative, HBsAg positive
carrier mothers to their babies have never been
documented.
In the present study, to explore the infectivity
of anti-HBe positive, HBsAg positive carrier
mothers to their offspring the expression of
HBV-DNA was determined in plasma and
peripheral mononuclear cells by a newly develo￾ped method, the polymerase chain reaction.
Coupled with molecular hybridisation analysis
the polymerase chain reaction can define atto￾gram concentrations of HBV-DNA.9 The pre￾sent results demonstrate the close association
between the HBV-DNA expression in maternal
peripheral mononuclear cells and the onset of
acute or fulminant hepatitis in early infancy.
Subjects and methods
The serological markers of HBV infection were
detected by reverse passive haemagglutination
for HBsAg, passive haemagglutination for anti￾HBs, immunoadherence haemagglutination for
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for
HBeAg and its antibody (Abbott Laboratories).
We examined 28 mothers known to be anti￾HBe positive, HBsAg positive carriers and 29 of
their infants. The mothers were asymptomatic,
without liver function abnormalities, during a
one to five year follow up. All infants studied
were negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs in cord
blood, and serum HBsAg and anti-HBs concen￾trations and transaminase activities were mea￾sured every three months until age 1 year. At
birth and at 2 months of age two infants were
given HBIgs (pepsin digested Cohn fraction II
HBIg, 200 IU/ml, provided by the Japanese
Red Cross Central Blood Centre, Tokyo). They
were also given HBV vaccine (HBsAg:10 tg
protein/2-5 ml, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo) at 3,
4, and 6 months of age.
Samples of heparinised peripheral blood were
layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque (Oncor Inc), and
plasma and mononuclear cells were separated
by centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were
washed twice in phosphate buffered saline and
then were immediately frozen at -80°C. DNA
preparation, DNA amplification, and gel
separation/Southern hybridisation methods
have been previously described.9 Briefly, DNA
was amplified in a 100 id reaction mixture that
contained 10 tl sample DNA, 2-5 units Taq
DNA polymerase, 200 jtmol of each deoxynuc￾leotide triphosphate (dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and
dGTP), 1 [imol of each primer (primer 114:
5'-ACAGAGTCTAGACTCGTGGT-3', primer

visualised by ultraviolet fluorescence after stain￾ing with ethidium bromide. After Southern
blotting to 'Hybond N' membranes (Amer￾sham), blots were hybridised with a cloned
HBV-DNA probe labelled by random primed
incorporation of digoxigenin labelled deoxyuri￾dine triphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim).
Alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody to
digoxigenin was then applied to the membrane
and the colorimetric reaction was carried out on
the membrane.

HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive, and
none showed evidence of active hepatitis. Dur￾ing the next one to five years, serological mar￾kers and transaminase activities of these women
were essentially unchanged. The HBV infection
status of each father was also determined, and
no evidence of infection was obtained (data not

DNA was extracted from 200 1d of plasma

25 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction. A

agarose/Nusieve gel in three independent
experiments. Southern hybridisation was used
to confirm the specificity of the amplified

All of the 28 plasma samples were negative by
both direct visualisation of amplified DNA and
by Southern hybridisation, even when increased
amounts of DNA were applied in the polymer￾ase chain reaction mixture. In contrast, 473 base

remaining 25 mononuclear cell DNA samples
were negative by both DNA gel analysis and
hybridisation (partly shown in figs 1 and 2).
The HBV markers and transaminase activi￾ties of the offspring were serially determined.
Among the four infants born to the three
mothers who carried HBV-DNA positive
mononuclear cells, two developed acute or ful￾minant hepatitis within three months after birth
(table). In the infant with acute hepatitis anti￾HBs, and later anti-HBc, became positive, con￾firming HBV infection. One of the remaining
two infants, who was the younger sister of the
girl who died from fulminant hepatitis, was
administered HBIg/HBV vaccine, and acquired
protection against HBV as her anti-HBs was
positive and anti-HBc negative after prophy￾laxis. The last one of the four was also adminis￾tered HBIg/HBV vaccine because her mother
seroconverted from HBeAg positive to anti￾HBe positive shortly before delivery (between
29 and 36 weeks of gestation), and the infant
also acquired HBV protection (table). In the
other 25 infants, whose mothers were HBV￾DNA negative in both plasma and mononuclear
cells, no HBV markers and no increased activi￾ties of transaminases were detected in the next
seven months to 3* 5 years. Taken together these
results strongly suggests that the association
between the HBV-DNA expression in maternal
peripheral mononuclear cells and the HBV
infection of their infants is highly specific.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that even
asymptomatic, anti-HBe positive pregnant
women may carry HBV-DNA positive mono￾nuclear cells in the peripheral blood that can
transmit infectious HBV to their offspring. This
is the first report concerning the association
between the presence of HBV-DNA in maternal
mononuclear cells and the onset of infantile
hepatitis. In Japan 1-2% of pregnant women are
HBsAg positive carriers and three quarters of
them are HBeAg negative. This percentage of
HBV carriers seems relatively high, but the pre￾valence of HBV in Japan is about 20 times more
than in Europe. Therefore it is important to
pick up high risk infants and to find the most
effective means of treatment. Our findings indi￾cate that HBV determination in peripheral
mononuclear cells of such pregnant women will
aid screening of high risk infants before de￾livery.
Infectivity of HBV was apparently due to
mononuclear cells in matemal peripheral blood.
In order to acquire the capability of viral repli￾cation, the infected mononuclear cells are prob￾ably transmitted first as intact cells to the
infants, and then the HBV is activated. The
possible route of mononuclear cell transmission
could be transplacental passage around deliv￾ery. Previously, Desai and Creger reported that
the maternal mononuclear cells definitely circu￾late in newborn babies. 0 They labelled in vitro
the maternal peripheral mononuclear cells by
immunofluorescence and injected them back
into the mother shortly before delivery. They
detected the labelled matemal mononuclear
cells in the infant's circulation. Very recently
the transfer of mononuclear cells from fetus to
mother was determined by the polymerase
chain reaction. Y chromosome specific DNA
sequences were detected in pregnant women
carrying male fetuses. " These findings strongly
suggested that bidirectional mononuclear cell
traffic between mother and fetus is not uncom￾mon. Therefore, it is most likely that HBV car￾rying maternal mononuclear cells traverse the
placenta intact. But other routes of HBV trans￾mission, for example horizontal infection after
birth, are possible. Further studies are needed.
It was surprising that, though the women
were asymptomatic, acute or fulminant hepati￾tis could occur in the infants. The HBs anti￾genaemia in these anti-HBe positive women
might at least indicate active translation of viral
DNA, which is the final step of HBV express￾ion, suggesting that an immunological inactiva￾tion process is operating in the women. Such a
mechanism might be too immature and thus
unable to protect the infants from viral activa￾tion. The direct link between HBV and lym￾phoid cells was very recently established. 12 The
evidence for the replication of HBV in periphe￾ral mononuclear cells derives from the demon￾stration that a 3 43-5 kb RNA transcipt was
detected by northern blot analysis in mononuc￾lear cells that expressed HBsAg on their
surface,'3 and that 1-10% lymphocytes
obtained from HBsAg positive, HBeAg nega￾tive chronic carriers contained viral RNA by in
situ hybridisation.'4
Our findings will also be relevant to the

prevention of infantile fulminant hepatitis.
Although one child of a HBV-DNA positive
mother died at 3 months from fulminant hepati￾tis, HBV infection was averted in the sister by
the combined administration of HBIg and HBV
vaccine. There must be an argument that with￾out the combined treatment no one can predict
anything about the infant's prognosis. This
seems to be reasonable, but a recent trial of the
prophylactic HBIg single injection to infants
born to HBeAg negative, HBsAg positive car￾rier mothers proved effective in reducing the
rate of onset of infantile hepatitis to about
20-30% of the non-treated children.'5 It is still
difficult to predict the risk of fuliminant hepati￾tis, so it would seem prudent that infants of
HBV-DNA mononuclear cell positive mothers
receive treatment with both HBIg and HBV
vaccine.

Urinary infection: what little boys do in the bath
A recent paper from Quebec (J Labbe, Pediatrics 1990;86:703-6)
raises an interesting new possibility as regards the aetiology of
urinary infection in boys. A prospective consecutive series of 22
boys aged between 5 and 15 years who attended a urinary infection
clinic at a university medical centre, together with nine others
detected retrospectively, were questioned about penile self
instrumentation in the bath or shower. Ten of the 31 admitted
injecting bath water into the urethra in the few days before the
onset of symptoms. The instruments used were a syringe (n=4),
a rubber bulb (n=3), a plastic bottle (n=2), and a 'hand-held
shower massager' (n= 1). Lower abdominal pain, dysuria, and
gross haematuria were more common in the 10 boys who admitted
self instrumentation (group A) than in the 21 who didn't (group
B). Urine culture in group A produced Escherichia coli in five and
Staphylococcus saprophyticus in the other five. Only one child in
group B was infected with the latter organism. Imaging of the
renal tracts showed no abnormalities in group A but was abnormal
in a third of the boys in group B.
Is this study representative? I imagine, but don't know, that
such things as syringes and rubber bulbs may be less available in
British bathrooms. The frequency of this behaviour in normal
boys is unknown so it is difficult to assess the size of its contribu￾tion, if any, to the problem of urinary infection in boys, but it's an
idea worth pursuing. No doubt we shall hear more on this subject.
