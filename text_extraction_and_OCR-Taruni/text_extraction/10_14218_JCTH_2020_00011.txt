Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in patients with
cirrhosis, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is second most
common etiology of AKI after volume responsible pre-renal
etiology. AKI in these patients negatively impacts pre- and
post-transplant patient survival and healthcare burden. Re￾duced effective blood volume with consequent reduced renal
blood flow, along with systemic inflammation in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis, result in susceptibility to HRS. In
this article, we will review updates over the last 5 years on the
changing definition with diagnostic criteria and nomenclature
of AKI and HRS, data on medical treatment with vasocon￾strictors, and urinary biomarkers in diagnosis of etiology of
AKI. We will also discuss the significance of liver trans￾plantation evaluation once the diagnosis of HRS is established
and the post-transplant immunosuppression management.
We will also review one of the challenging issues that remains
among transplant-eligible patients, that of allocation of si￾multaneous liver kidney transplant. Finally, we will review the
new implemented policy from the Organ Procurement Trans￾plant Network on simultaneous liver kidney allocation.

Introduction
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) among patients with cirrhosis is
one of the most devastating complications, with high mortality if
not promptly recognized and properly treated.1,2 Portal hyper￾tension in cirrhosis leads to splanchnic arterial vasodilation,
which results in reduced systemic vascular resistance and effec￾tive circulating blood volume.3 Compensatory increase in
cardiac output by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldoster￾one and sympathetic nervous systems results in vasoconstric￾tion of renal arteries with reduced renal blood flow. These
physiological changes combined with hypoalbuminemia from
reduced synthetic function of liver lead to sodium and water
retention, manifesting as ascites and edema and setting the
stage for development of acute kidney injury (AKI) and HRS.
Inflammation with systemic inflammatory response syndrome
in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and decompensated cir￾rhosis is emerging as another major mechanism for the devel￾opment of HRS.
In this article, we will review recent updates on the definition
and terminology, criteria for diagnosis, emerging biomarkers [in
differentiating HRS from intra-renal cause of AKI, especially
acute tubular necrosis (ATN)], medical management, and role
of liver transplantation (LT), especially for criteria for allocation
of simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) transplantation
Prevalence and healthcare burden
HRS is common among patients with cirrhosis and its occur￾rence increases with its severity and duration. For example, in
a prospective study, the incidence of HRS was 18% at 1 year
and 39% at 5 years of follow-up.4 Another study described the
prevalence of HRS in about 48% of patients listed for LT.5 Apart
from negative impact on patient survival and outcomes, HRS is
associated with huge healthcare cost and significant socio-eco￾nomic burden.6 For example, in a retrospective study on 2542
patients hospitalized with HRS, mean length of hospital stay
per patient was 30.5 days, with $91,504 per admission.7
Definition of AKI and HRS
Serum creatinine estimation in patients with cirrhosis may not
provide true renal function, due to a) malnutrition and muscle
atrophy that occur with reduced synthesis of creatinine, b)
increased renal tubular secretion of creatinine, c) dilution of
serum creatinine due to increased volume of distribution in
cirrhotic patients, and d) measurement error when there is
cholestasis with elevation of serum bilirubin levels.8,9 However,
in routine practice, serum creatinine continues to be used for
monitoring renal function and diagnosing AKI and HRS. This is
because the test is simple, inexpensive, readily performed,
widely available, and can be repeated frequently during the
day. Over the last 10-15 years, the old definition of AKI using
serum creatinine cut-off at 1.5 mg/dL has been changed, since
even a minor change from baseline of as little as 0.3 mg/dL has
been found to be associated with worse patient survival among
hospitalized patients.10 Currently, AKI is defined as increase in
serum creatinine of $0.3 mg/dL within 48 h among hospital￾ized patients, or $50% increase over baseline level within the
last 3 months among outpatients, or urine volume <0.5 mL/
kg/h for about 6 h. Further, severity of AKI is stratified into
three stages: stage 1 defined by increase in serum creatinine
$0.3 mg/dL or 1.5- to 2-fold from baseline; stage 2 defined by
increase by 2- to 3-fold; and, stage 3 defined by >3-fold

increase or absolute serum creatinine of $4 mg/dL or initiation
of renal replacement therapy.11
Beyond the well-known types of AKI, namely, pre-renal,
intrarenal and post-renal, patients with cirrhosis may develop
a specific type of renal dysfunction of HRS.12 Traditionally,
HRS is stratified into types 1 and 2, with 75% of cases
being due to type 1 HRS (rapid rise of creatinine to >2.5
mg/dL over 1-2 weeks) with a median survival of 50% at 2
weeks.5,13 In contrast, type 2 HRS, which presents as indo￾lent decrease in renal function is often associated with refrac￾tory ascites, with median survival of about 6 months.11,14,15
Recently, the nomenclature of HRS types has been modified
with ‘HRS-AKI’ replacing HRS type 1 and ‘HRS-CKD’ replacing
HRS type 2 (Table 1).12 Being most common, the current
review will focus on the HRS-AKI type.
Pathophysiology of HRS
Portal hypertension in cirrhosis results in splanchnic vasodila￾tion, with pooling of blood and reduced effective circulating blood
volume.16 In early stages of cirrhosis, compensatory increase in
cardiac output maintains the circulatory volume. However, the
susceptibility of such afflicted patients to reduced renal blood
flow and AKI is increased with a) hypovolemia (nausea, vomit￾ing, diarrhea, poor oral intake, diuretics, gastrointestinal
bleeding, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or radio￾contrast agents), b) progressive disease with increasing severity
and decompensation of cirrhosis, and c) cirrhotic cardiomyop￾athy in 40–50% of patients with cirrhosis and diastolic dysfunc￾tion.17 The reduced circulating blood volume results in activation
of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous
systems, with sodium water retention and reduced renal blood
flow occurring due to the vasoconstriction of renal arteries, with
development of HRS-AKI (Fig. 1).
Recently, there is a growing line of evidence on the role of
inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in
the development of HRS.18,19 Systemic inflammation induced
either by pathogen-associated molecular patterns or by damage￾associated molecular patterns plays a key role in the development
of acute decompensation in patients with cirrhosis.12
Bacterial translocation from the gut due to increased intes￾tinal permeability with activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (com￾monly known as TLR4) on hepatic macrophages results in
inflammatory response.20 Additionally, studies have suggested
the up-regulation of renal tubular TLR4, which is associated with
the development of renal dysfunction and tubular damage.12
The activated inflammatory cascade leads to release of
proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha or
interleukin-6) and vasodilators [nitric oxide (commonly
referred to as NO)]. Studies have also suggested that bacterial
translocation plays a predominant role in causing the arterial
vasodilation that is seen in advanced liver cirrhosis, occurring
by stimulation of NO production and up-regulation mediated
by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.21 About 30% of patients with
HRS have systemic inflammatory response syndrome, due to
sterile inflammation in the absence of bacterial infection.18
Diagnosis of HRS
As soon as the diagnosis of AKI is established, steps are taken to
expand the intravascular circulating blood volume, including
withholding diuretics and administering intravenous fluid (1.5 L
of normal saline or 1 gm/kg of albumin).22 Simultaneously, efforts
should be made to determine specific intrarenal or post-renal
etiology with urine examination and renal ultrasound respectively
(Fig. 2). Additionally, patients with ATN versus HRS could be dis￾tinguished based on fractional excretion of sodium. It appears
that fractional excretion of sodium less than 0.2% may be clin￾ically useful for distinguishing HRS from ATN.23 If renal function
does not normalize or improve with/within 48 h of this strategy
and approach, a diagnosis of HRS is established if the work-up is
negative for other etiologies of AKI (Fig. 2 and Table 1).15
There is emerging data on the utility of plasma and urine
biomarkers of renal injury, such as neutrophil gelatinase￾associated lipocalin, human endothelin-1, uromodulin, fatty
acid binding protein, epidermal growth factor kidney injury
molecule-1, and interlukin-18. In a prospective study, urinary
concentration of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
measured at day 3 of development of AKI was found to be
accurate for differentiating ATN from other causes of AKI, with
c-statistic of 0.87 (95% confidence interval of 0.78-0.95). In
this study, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was also
found to independently predict AKI progression and 28-day
mortality.24 Further studies are needed to validate the utility of
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin before implementing
this in routine management of patients with AKI.
Pre-transplant management of HRS
The medical management of HRS has been shown to improve
short-term outcomes; however, long-term outcomes are poor
without LT. The aim of the medical therapy is to stabilize the
patient until LT and to optimize their pre-transplant condition.
The medical therapy includes early treatment of AKI and use
of vasoconstrictors.1
Early treatment of AKI
Early recognition and treatment is key to improving both pre￾and post-transplant outcomes of patients with cirrhosis. The

main aim is to identify and treat reversible factors, like
dehydration, nephrotoxic medications (diuretics, non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), infection and
sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.25 If large volume par￾acentesis is needed, especially over 3-5 L, intravenous

albumin replacement should be used with 6-8 g of albumin for
every 1 L of ascitic fluid removed. Patients with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis should also receive intravenous albumin
(1.5 g/kg on day 1, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3), along with
antibiotic to improve outcome of these patients.26
HRS is a common complication that can occur during acute
alcohol hepatitis, having a mortality of about 90% within 3
months, unless the patient receives liver transplant. Hence,
early recognition and treatment for acute alcohol hepatitis is
needed with alcohol abstinence supplemental nutrition, and,
for select patients, pentoxifylline or corticosteroids.27
Prevention of HRS
Physicians managing patients with cirrhosis should be cogni￾zant of reduced effective circulatory blood volume and renal
blood flow, especially with the onset of portal hypertension.
These patients should avoid nephrotoxic medications, espe￾cially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Radiocontrast
agents should be used judiciously. Optimization of diuretics
should be performed with close follow up of basic metabolic
panel and renal function. Further, early identification and
treatment of AKI prevents progression and improves patient
outcomes. The threshold should be low in using intravenous
albumin for expanding fluid volume, especially in hospitalized
patients with AKI and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. For
example, in a randomized controlled trial, use of intravenous
albumin prevented type-1 HRS in patients with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis; the trial suggested decreased incidence
of HRS (28% vs. 41%) and an improvement in 3-month
survival (94% vs. 62%) in this population, when compared to
placebo.28
Vasoconstrictor therapy
Vasoconstrictors cause constriction of splanchnic vessels,
resulting in increasing the effective circulating blood
volume, which in turn increases renal perfusion and glomer￾ular filtration.11 Vasoconstrictors work better when used with
intravenous albumin.29 Terlipressin is the most common vas￾opressor used and acts on the V1 receptors on vascular
smooth muscle cells.30 In a systematic review and meta￾analysis of eight randomized trials, terlipressin was associ￾ated with 15% and 9% reduction of overall and HRS-related
mortality respectively.31 Another meta-analysis of 309
patients showed mortality benefit with terlipressin, with rela￾tive risk of 0.76 (95% confidence interval of 0.61-0.95).32
Although, used extensively throughout the world, terlipressin
is not yet approved by the FDA for use in the USA.11 A recent
randomized placebo controlled trial from North America
(CONFIRM trial) involving 300 participants (199 receiving ter￾lipressin), HRS reversal was documented in 29.1% of terli￾pressin-treated patients compared to 15.8% of patients
receiving placebo (p<0.012).33 Major side effects of terlipres￾sin included abdominal cramps and diarrhea in about 20%
patients and tachyarrhythmias or chest pain in 6% of
patients. Rarely, ischemia of bowel or skin and extremities
can occur.32 These side effects are less frequent with use of
terlipressin as continuous intravenous infusion, as compared
to when the drug is applied in intravenous boluses, due to the
less daily total dose needed when used as an infusion.34
As terlipressin is currently not available in the USA, other
vasoconstrictors like norepinephrine, midodrine, and octreo￾tide, are used for the treatment of HRS. Norepinephrine, a
catecholamine with predominantly alpha-adrenergic activity,
is an inexpensive alternative and widely used as an infusion
for the treatment of HRS.35 In a meta-analysis of seven trials
of norepinephrine compared with terlipressin, the drugs were
found to be equally effective in reversal of HRS (53 vs. 55%, p
indicated non-significance).36
Midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agent administered orally
in combination with subcutaneous octreotide, is another
alternative. In a case-control study, use of this combination
on 75 HRS patients improved transplant-free survival, overall
survival, with better renal function at 1 month compared to
historical cohort of 87 HRS patients who did not receive this
specific pharmacologic vasoconstrictor therapy.37
In the most recent meta-analysis of 13 randomized con￾trolled trials on use of vasoconstrictors for HRS, terlipressin
was the most effective agent for HRS reversal and norepi￾nephrine was as effective as terlipressin. However, both these
drugs were superior to midodrine and octreotide combination
for HRS survival.38 None of the drugs showed any benefit on
HRS relapse or on patient survival. Based on these data, until
terlipressin is available for use in the USA, norepinephrine
remains the drug of choice, especially for patients treated in
the intensive care unit, and the midodrine/octreotide combi￾nation is reserved for patients treated on the medical floor
(Table 2).
Most patients are treated for 2 weeks at least before
declaring non-response and discontinuation of the specific
medication. As mentioned earlier, to achieve maximum
efficacy, vasoconstrictors are used in combination with intra￾venous albumin infusion. Among responders, midodrine is
usually continued indefinitely or until LT. In one study, out￾patient terlipressin infusion as a bridge to LT has been
reported in six patients after HRS reversal was documented,
with three patients successfully bridged to LT.39 Further pro￾spective studies are needed to evaluate the role and regimen
of this approach as basis for maintaining renal function and
bridging patients to LT. The role of vasoconstrictors for type 2
HRS or HRS-CKD remains unclear and most studies have
been performed on HRS-AKI patients. In a non-randomized
study, terlipressin was associated with improved renal func￾tion in patients with type 2 HRS.40 Further good quality
randomized data is needed to evaluate the efficacy and
long-term safety of these agents in patients with HRS-CKD.
Miscellaneous therapies
Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt for HRS. Two small
case series found improvement in renal function and survival
in patients who underwent transjugular intrahepatic porto￾systemic stent-shunt for HRS.41,42 However, transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt is a risky procedure
and patients with HRS are usually too sick to undergo this
procedure. Until benefit of transjugular intrahepatic portosys￾temic stent-shunt is documented in randomized controlled
trials, the procedure is not recommended in the management
of HRS. Renal replacement therapy can be used as a bridge to
LT in patients who fail medical therapy.14 The indications for
renal replacement therapy in these patients are the same as
for any other cause of AKI and include volume overload with
10% or more weight gain, hyperkalemia, symptomatic
uremia, pericarditis, and acidosis. Risks of dialysis include
hypotension, infection, and bleeding. Additionally, the exact
mode of dialysis for these patients remains unknown. There is

no evidence on survival benefit with renal replacement
therapy among patients not eligible for LT.43 Molecular
absorbent recirculating system by extra-corporeal albumin
dialysis has been proposed as a treatment of refractory
ACLF. In a randomized study of 166 patients, survival was
similar in patients receiving standard of care (n=81) and
patients treated with extra-corporeal albumin dialysis
(n=85). However, extra-corporeal albumin dialysis was supe￾rior in improving encephalopathy, reducing bilirubin, and
improving serum creatinine. Based on these data, extra-cor￾poreal albumin dialysis may be an alternative option to bridge
patients with HRS to LT.44
Liver transplantation for HRS
Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for HRS and
can be considered as soon as diagnosis of HRS is established.
HRS patients, even after successful medical therapy and
reversal of HRS, have poorer post-transplant outcomes than
patients without HRS. In one study, of 104 patients, 33 with
HRS had longer intensive care unit stay with higher use of
hospital resources (including dialysis and blood transfusion),
poorer renal function at 1 year, and worse patient survival.
However, the patient survival rate at 5 years was satisfactory,
at about 80%, justifying its use in these HRS.45 It should be
recognized that HRS patients with longer duration of renal
dysfunction prior to LT may not recover renal function after
LT. In another study, about 6% increased risk of non-recovery
of renal function was shown with each additional day of pre￾transplant dialysis.46
Simultaneous liver kidney allocation
Since the introduction of the model for end-stage liver disease
scoring system, a proportion of all LT receiving simultaneous
liver kidney (SLK) has increased from 4% in 2002 to 10% in
2016.47,48 Selection of candidates for SLK is a challenge for
the hepatology and nephrology transplant community, as
there are no good predictors for recovery of renal function
after LT alone.49,50 In general, SLK transplantation provides
survival benefit over LT alone to patients with serum creati￾nine >2 mg/dL and/or patients on hemodialysis. However, the
data are scanty on the duration of renal dysfunction or of
dialysis in predicting recovery of renal function after LT
alone. Criteria for SLK allocation are therefore based on con￾sensus recommendations and without good scientific data,
which explains the increasing use of SLK and also the hetero￾geneity of their use across the regions and also between
centers within the region (Table 3).49
The Organ Procurement Transplant Network introduced a
new policy in 2016 for SLK allocation, with the following
criteria: A) for chronic kidney disease: a) glomerular filtration
rate of <60 mL/min for 90 days and subsequent glomerular
filtration rate of <30 mL/min or initiation of dialysis, b)
chronic kidney disease due to metabolic disease that can be
corrected with a liver transplant (hyperoxaluria, atypical
hemolytic uremic syndrome, familial non-neuropathic sys￾temic amyloidosis, and methylmalonic aciduria); and B) for
AKI: a) duration of AKI >6 weeks with persistent glomerular
filtration rate of <20 mL/min, b) need of dialysis for >6
weeks, or combination of both the criteria meeting 5 weeks
duration. Under this policy, the respective criteria need to be
documented every 7 days to maintain listing for SLK.51 A
recent study examined the effects of the implementation of
the Organ Procurement Transplant Network policy on 40,979
candidates, of which 1683 met the new criteria, 2452 met the
old criteria, and 1878 met both the criteria. They found that
patients meeting the new criteria were less likely to die post￾transplant.52 Further studies are needed for continuous

monitoring of SLK outcomes with the implementation of the
new policy.
Whether urinary or plasma biomarkers of tubular injury
can improve optimal allocation of SLK was tested in a small
open study. However, none of the biomarkers tested within 30
days prior to LT among patients with cirrhosis and AKI were
useful in predicting recovery of renal function after LT alone.53
There remains unmet need of accurate biomarkers for differ￾entiation of HRS from ATN and predictors using clinical varia￾bles or biomarkers or combination of both for recovery of
renal function after LT alone, as basis for optimal SLK alloca￾tion and use of already scarce donor kidney pool.
Post-transplant management
Common risk factors for the development of end-stage renal
disease during the post-transplant period include calcineurin
inhibitor nephrotoxicity, pre-transplant HRS, pre-existing
renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus.54–56 Additionally,
episodes of acute renal failure, renal replacement therapy
pre- and post-transplantation, hepatitis C infection, and
increasing age have been shown to be associated with risk
of chronic kidney disease in the post-transplant period.57–59
Given the significant nephrotoxic effects of calcineurin
inhibitor, renal-sparing regimens have been used for preserv￾ing renal function in the post-transplant period among
patients receiving LT for HRS. For example, use of renal￾sparing approaches have been effective to preserve renal
function during the post-transplant period, such as with a)
interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (daclizumab, or basilixi￾mab) or polyclonal antibodies (rabbit anti-thymocyte globu￾lin) for induction of immunosuppression and delaying the
introduction of calcineurin inhibitor, and b) mTOR inhibitors,
such as everolimus or low-dose calcineurin inhibitor, with
other agents, like mycophenolate, for maintaining the
immunosuppression.60–62
Role of palliative care
Patients with progressive HRS and those ineligible for LT have
high short-term mortality with huge healthcare burden. For
example, in a study using the national in-patient sample on
hospitalized cirrhosis patients who were denied LT, multiple
somatic symptoms were experienced with poor quality of life,
and this was associated with prolonged hospitalization and
higher use of hospital resources. Only 11% of these patients
received palliative care consultation.63 Consideration should
be given on a case-by-case basis, to discuss the goals of care
with the patient and families.63 Future research should eval￾uate timing and effects of palliative care on quality of end-of￾life care in this population.
Conclusions
HRS is a serious complication among patients with liver
cirrhosis and is associated with poor prognosis. With recent
advances in therapeutic strategies due to better understand￾ing of pathophysiology, there is a hope to reduce its preva￾lence and improve patient outcomes. Terlipressin and
norepinephrine infusion are effective vasoconstrictors, and
midodrine combined with octreotide is an alternative option.
With the encouraging data from a recently completed multi￾center trial in the USA, it is hoped that terlipressin will be
approved by the Federal Drug Administration for clinical use in
the USA. Vasoconstrictors provide better efficacy when com￾bined with intravenous albumin. Neutrophil gelatinase-asso￾ciated lipocalin at day 3 of onset of AKI is a promising tool for
differentiating intrarenal etiology from HRS; however, larger
prospective data are needed as basis for validation before
implementing into routine clinical practice. Lack of accurate
models for predicting renal function recovery after LT has
resulted in increase in the use of SLK in these patients. It is
hopeful that the recently introduced Organ Procurement
Transplant Network policy for SLK allocation and listing
would optimize the use of SLK and help the already scarce
kidney donor pool. There remains a clinical unmet need for
better and more accurate models predictive of renal function
recovery after LT and non-invasive urine or plasma bio￾markers for accurate diagnosis of HRS.
