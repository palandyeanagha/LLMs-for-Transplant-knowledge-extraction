Abstract
Background: Patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation have a hyperdynamic circulation which
persists into the early postoperative period making accurate assessment of fluid requirements challenging. Goal￾directed fluid therapy (GDFT) has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in a number of surgery settings.
The impact of GDFT in patients undergoing liver transplantation is unknown. A feasibility trial was designed to
determine patient and clinician support for recruitment into a randomised controlled trial of GDFT following liver
transplantation, adherence to a GDFT protocol, participant withdrawal, and to determine appropriate endpoints for
a subsequent larger trial to evaluate the efficacy of GDFT in patients undergoing liver transplantation.
Methods: The Cardiac output Optimisation following Liver Transplant (COLT) trial is designed as a prospective,
single-centre, randomised controlled study to assess the feasibility and safety of GDFT in liver transplantation for
patients with cirrhosis. Consenting adults (aged between 18 and 80 years) with biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis who
have been selected to undergo a first liver transplantation will be included in the trial and randomised into GDFT
or standard care starting immediately after surgery and continuing for the first 12 h thereafter. Both groups will
have cardiac output and stroke volume monitored using the FloTrac (EV1000) device. The intervention will consist
of a protocolised GDFT approach to patient management, using stroke volume optimisation. The control group
will receive standard care, without stroke volume and cardiac output measurement. After 12 h the patient’s fluid
management will revert to standard of care. The primary endpoint of this study is feasibility. Secondary endpoints
will include a safety assessment of the intervention, graft and patient survival, liver function, postoperative complications
graded by Clavien-Dindo criteria, length of intensive care and hospital stay and quality of life across the intervention and
control groups.
Discussion: There is a growing body of evidence that the use of perioperative GDFT in surgical patients can
improve outcomes; however, signals of harm have also been detected. Patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing
liver transplantation have markedly different cardiovascular physiology than general surgical patients. If GDFT is
proven to be feasible and safe in this patient group, then a multicentre trial to demonstrate efficacy and cost￾effectiveness will be required.

Background
Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) aims to deliver the
correct amount of intravenously administered (IV) fluids
to patients at the correct time, thus avoiding the well￾documented detrimental consequences of either inad￾equate or excessive IV fluids. Several clinical trials in
surgical patients have shown the benefit from using
haemodynamic (cardiac output) monitoring coupled
with a validated protocol for IV fluids in reducing post￾operative morbidity and hospital length of stay; however,
signals of harm have been detected [1, 2]. Hence, fluid
therapy strategies are increasingly refined for each clin￾ical scenario taking into account the disease processes
involved. This goal-directed approach to perioperative
fluid management has shown a reduction in intensive
care unit (ICU) utilisation and hospital length of stay in
the general surgical population [3]. Over the last two
decades, the development of numerous non-invasive
haemodynamic monitoring devices has allowed assess￾ment of cardiac output (and stroke volume (SV)) with￾out the need for invasive techniques such as pulmonary
artery catheterisation [4]. The academic literature sup￾porting their use in the perioperative period is rapidly
expanding and a recent National Institute of Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommended that a
cardiac output monitor should be used in all major sur￾gery [5]. This document also highlighted the significant
cost savings when the GDFT approach to perioperative
care is used, through the avoidance of complications and
excessive hospital length of stay. A single, major, postop￾erative complication costs the NHS approximately
£10,000 [6].
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver undergoing liver
transplantation pose a unique challenge in that they have
the altered haemodynamics associated with end-stage
cirrhosis compounded by the significant blood loss of
transplantation and the systemic changes associated with
ischaemia-reperfusion graft injury [7–9]. Therefore, data
supporting the use of GDFT following other forms of
high-risk surgery may not be applicable to this patient
cohort. It is conceivable that GDFT could do harm in
this complex patient population, as shown in other set￾tings [10]. In severe acute pancreatitis, early high￾volume fluid administration, as was routinely recom￾mended in clinical practise guidelines, has been shown
to increase mortality as well as complications [11]. Cir￾rhosis is associated with a variety of circulatory changes
including portal hypertension, venous shunting, periph￾eral venous dilatation and a hyperdynamic circulation
with an elevated cardiac output that persists into the
early post-transplant period [12–14]. Measurements of
central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge-pressures
have traditionally been used to try and identify hypovol￾aemia post liver transplantation but both values are
known to be limited in their ability to do this [15]. Less
invasive pulse-contour analysis devices, such as the Flo￾Trac (EV1000) device, have been used for cardiac output
measurement with reasonable accuracy in patients
undergoing liver transplantation [16, 17]. Whilst there
are many donor and recipient factors that contribute to
graft and patient survival [18, 19], optimal perfusion of
the graft is the final common pathway for many of the
factors influencing outcome and optimising hepatic
blood flow following liver transplant has been shown to
result in improved graft function [20].
A feasibility trial was designed to determine patient and
clinician support for recruitment into a randomised con￾trolled trial (RCT) of GDFT in liver transplantation, ad￾herence to a GDFT protocol, participant withdrawal and
to determine appropriate endpoints for a subsequent RCT
to evaluate the efficacy and costs-effectiveness of GDT in
patients undergoing liver transplantation.
Methods
Study design and setting
The COLT trial has been designed using the Standard
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Tri￾als (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Additional file 1) as a pro￾spective, single-centre, randomised controlled feasibility
trial [21]. The initial feasibility trial is to take place at the
Royal Free London NHS Foundation Hospital Trust
(RFLH), one of the eight designated liver transplant cen￾tres in UK with over 100 orthotopic liver transplants per
year with a view to conducting a subsequent multicentre,
cost-effectiveness trial. The trial is sponsored by Univer￾sity College London (UCL) and is funded by a National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient
Benefit (RfPB grant no. PB-PG-0214-33043). A trial out￾line is illustrated in Fig. 1 and the schedule of enrolment,
interventions and assessments is shown in Fig. 2.
Ethical approval
The study was reviewed and approved by University Col￾lege London Bloomsbury Research Ethics Committee (Ref:
180463) and has been registered at International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN10329248
https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10329248) on 4 April
2016.
Participants
Consenting adult patients (aged between 18 and 80
years) with liver cirrhosis selected to undergo liver trans￾plantation will be included in the trial. The exclusion
criteria will be those with non-cirrhotic liver disease,
pregnancy, age less than 18 years or over 80 years, body
weight less than 40 kg, re-transplantation for primary
graft non-function, fulminant hepatic failure, emergency
surgery, known learning disabilities or previously lacking
Froghi et al. Trials (2018) 19:170 Page 2 of 9

capacity to consent for themselves or with previous epi￾sodes of encephalopathy, prisoners, patients already en￾rolled in an interventional study and refusal or inability
to consent.
Recruitment
Patients are screened in the transplant assessment clinic
and are provided with the trial Patient Information Sheet
(PIS) directly or by post. The trial is then discussed with
a team member in depth at the time of the subsequent
short-stay inpatient assessment. Informed consent is
then obtained by a member of the research team and a
baseline quality of life (QoL) assessment is performed.
Power calculation
This is a feasibility study and a power calculation is,
therefore, not required. A total of 50 patients will be re￾cruited with 25 in the GDFT and 25 in standard care
treatment arms.
Randomisation
We will use a commercially available clinical randomisa￾tion service (http://www.sealedenvelope.com) immedi￾ately after liver transplantation at the time of admission
to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients will be rando￾mised to one of the two groups (GDFT versus standard
care) using stratified random permuted blocks of varying
block sizes to ensure similar numbers in the groups
whilst maintaining blinding and concealed allocation.
Randomisation will be stratified by donor type (De￾ceased after Cardiac Death (DCD) donor and Deceased
after Brain Death (DBD) donor) to achieve approximate
balance in this characteristic. Patients will be rando￾mised after surgery prior to arriving in ICU to either the
GDFT group or the standard care group on a 1:1 basis.
Intervention
The trial intervention period will commence when the
patient arrives on the ICU following transplant surgery
and will continue for 12 h postoperatively. In both study
groups (GDFT and control), a FloTrac sensor (EV1000
Clinical Platform, Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA,
USA) will be used to measure SV and cardiac output. In
the GDFT group only, this information will be used to
guide IV fluid therapy according to the study protocol
(Fig. 3). The intervention consists of an initial bolus in￾fusion of 250 mL Hartmann’s on arrival to ICU. If this
leads to a > 10% increase in SV the patient is deemed to
be fluid responsive and the bolus is repeated until no
further SV response is achieved (i.e. euvolaemia). SV is
continuously monitored and the bolus is repeated if the
Fig. 1 Trial flow diagram Fig. 2 Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments
Froghi et al. Trials (2018) 19:170 Page 3 of 9

SV drops by 10%. There are no extra maintenance fluids
in those who are not fluid responsive.
The FloTrac (EV1000) cardiac output monitor is a
non-invasive, pulse-wave-contour-analysis device that
estimates cardiac output and SV from an arterial line
trace. We will endeavour to use the radial artery in all
cases to standardise the approach. This device has been
shown to reliably track other accepted methods of moni￾toring cardiovascular haemodynamics [4].
The control group will receive standard care as per
ICU clinician choice and judgement. This will of course
be varied and not normally based on cardiac output
measures.
Blinding
A COLT trial research nurse will collect SV and cardiac
output data in the control group but these values will not
be available to the ICU team managing the post￾transplant fluid administration. The trial nurse and clinical
team will be aware of the participant’s group allocation.
The anaesthetic team involved in the liver transplant pro￾cedure will be blinded to the postoperative randomisation
as will the hepatology and surgical teams involved in the
postoperative management. Data will be collected on
complications and outcomes and presented to the Data
Monitoring Committee (DMC) as groups A and B with
the identification of the groups remaining blinded.

Froghi et al. Trials (2018) 19:170 Page 4 of 9

During the 12-h study period all other medical care
will be similar in the two groups and once the trial
period is complete, patients will return to standard med￾ical care with fluid administration as guided by the pa￾tient’s clinical team. The research nurses conducting this
trial will all be experienced intensive care nurses, trained
to use the EV1000 and will follow the GDFT protocol.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome of this study is feasibility. A re￾cruitment rate of greater than 40% of patients fulfilling
the criteria for this study will be deemed successful. We
shall assess patient recruitment, clinician support for the
trial, completion rate of the intervention and reasons for
participant withdrawal from the trial. Secondary out￾comes will explore the safety of the intervention, and to
assess endpoints in order to determine the most appro￾priate endpoints for a future trial of efficacy, and to fa￾cilitate sample size calculation. All transplant-related
and other complications will be recorded throughout the
inpatient stay as well as at 3 and 6 months’ follow-up.
To monitor safety, complications likely to be related to
the intervention will be reported and reviewed as a po￾tential serious adverse event (SAE). The safety profile
and complication rates in both arms (blinded) will be
reviewed regularly by an external Data Monitoring Com￾mittee (DMC). Most studies evaluating the benefit of
GDFT choose length of hospital stay or incidence of
postoperative complications as endpoints. In the high￾risk scenario of liver transplantation, long-term graft
(transplanted liver) function and patient survival may be
more appropriate endpoints. However, as the outcomes
of liver transplantation continually improve, these end￾points may not be achievable and other clinically relevant
endpoints, such as number and severity of complications
or health-related quality of life (QoL), may be more
appropriate.
A recent liver transplant patient and public involve￾ment (PPI) forum held at the Royal Free Hospital sought
the views of liver transplantation patients regarding the
most important outcome measures in liver transplant re￾search. Health-related QoL was deemed to be the pri￾mary endpoint which was most useful in liver transplant
trials. A composite measure of QoL and survival called
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be calculated in
the study. QoL will be measured using the EuroQol five
dimensions, five levels (EQ-5D-5 L) questionnaire which
is recommended by NICE to inform cost-utility analyses
of healthcare interventions [22].
Resource-use data will be collected during the trial
which will include core cost components during the in￾patient stay as well as costs associated with the conduct
of GDFT and the treatment of postoperative complica￾tions. Resources will be costed using national data
sources where available, supported by locally held cost￾ing data and will be used to estimate differences in costs
between the treatment arms. The difference in total
costs and QALYs across the control and GDFT groups
will be assessed. Given the small sample size, an incre￾mental cost per QALY will be not be estimated.
A recruitment rate of greater than 40% will be the cri￾teria to progress to a subsequent efficacy and cost￾effectiveness trial. We will not proceed to a subsequent
trial if there is a 10% or greater complication rate in the
intervention group than those seen in the control group.
Data collection and analysis
Each participant will be given a unique trial Participant
Identification Number (PIN). The health-related QoL
(EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire) will be collected at the base￾line, hospital discharge and at 3 and 6 months’ follow￾up. Utility value will be estimated from the EQ-5D-5 L
data at different time points using the crosswalk algo￾rithm developed by van Hout [23], which maps EQ-5D￾5 L responses to an EQ-5D-3 L UK value set, as per the
new NICE position statement and NICE reference case
[23–25]. Continuous haemodynamic data from the Flo￾Trac device will be collected during the study period for
both arms of the study as well as intraoperative and
postoperative IV fluid infusions (including IV fluids, ino￾tropes, vasopressors and transfusions of blood and blood
products). The volumes and timings of IV fluid boluses
according to the SV changes will also be recorded in the
GDFT arm. Complications will be recorded and graded
according to Clavien-Dindo classification along with
treatment costs [26].
The two treatment groups will be compared to ensure
that they have similar baseline characteristics including
cirrhosis aetiology using means and standard deviations
or medians and inter-quartile ranges for continuous var￾iables, as appropriate, and frequency counts and per￾centages for categorical variables. Information on donor
characteristics (DBD or DCD), warm/cold ischaemia
times, operative and reperfusion timing as well as tech￾nique of transplantation will also be collected and
compared.
For feasibility outcomes, the proportion of patients
who consent to be randomised will be presented with a
95% confidence interval. The proportion of patients
withdrawn from GDFT will be presented, as well as the
proportion of patients who deviate from the GDFT
protocol for the 12-h intervention period.
All complications will be documented and graded by
the Clavien-Dindo classification system. The mean dif￾ference in the proportion of people with a complication
between the two groups will be calculated and the differ￾ence between those with a mild (Clavien-Dindo grades
1–3) versus severe (Clavien-Dindo grades 4 and 5) will
Froghi et al. Trials (2018) 19:170 Page 5 of 9

be assessed. A 95% confidence interval will be presented.
The median number of complications and the median
grade of complications in each group will be presented.
The median length of stay in ICU and in hospital will be
presented for each group. The rate of readmission to
ICU will also be presented for each group. Quality of life
scores will be summarised for each group using mean
profile plots over time. The mean difference in QoL
scores between the two groups at 12 h will be presented
with a 95% confidence. If the data is not normal, a me￾dian difference will be presented.
Kaplan-Meier plots will be presented to compare sur￾vival rates between the two groups.
All other secondary outcomes will be summarised for
each group using mean profile plots over time. For bin￾ary secondary outcomes, the mean difference in propor￾tion at 12 h between the two groups will be presented
with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous secondary
outcomes, mean/median differences at 12 h will be pre￾sented as appropriate, with 95% confidence intervals.
The results will inform us how sensitive the outcome
measures are and, along with other information, will be
presented to a focus group involving liver transplant pa￾tients and their carers, the COLT trial team, a group of
transplant surgeons and physicians not involved with the
trial and other major stakeholders including representa￾tives of specialist societies. The results of the focus
group will be used to determine the primary outcome of
a subsequent multicentre RCT aimed at determining the
efficacy of GDFT in liver transplantation and the costs
involved. The results will also inform a sample size cal￾culation to determine the number of patients required
for the primary outcome chosen.
There is no planned interim analysis. However, the
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the re￾sults after each 20 randomised patients. The patients will
be grouped into a GDFT and a control group for the as￾sessment of complications but the data will be presented
to the DMC as two groups (A and B) without revealing
which is the intervention (GDFT) and which is the sham
control group. If the DMC feels that either group exceed
the expected rate of complications or the anticipated
morbidity and mortality, then the DMC may request
unblinding of data. Potential complications that could be
directly related to treatment are cardiac failure and
thromboembolic manifestations. Serious adverse events
(SAEs) are common following liver transplant. All events
will be graded as to their possible or likely relationship
to the initial fluid management and will be reported to
the sponsor (Table 1).
Dissemination
The results of this study will be presented to the British
Transplant Society and prepared for publication in peer￾reviewed journals with an interest in critical care and
organ transplantation.
Discussion
Every year 6000 to 7000 people in the UK, many of whom
are in the prime of life, die from chronic liver disease
which can be effectively treated with liver transplantation.
However, with an increasing number of liver transplants
being performed each year and a concomitant lack of suit￾able donor organs, transplant centres are using livers of
marginal suitability. This is associated with an increased
risk of postoperative complications along with reduced
graft and patient survival. More than 800 liver transplants
are performed per year in the UK, at a cost of approxi￾mately £80,000 per procedure. A large part of this sub￾stantial cost is due to the treatment of postoperative
complications. There is consequently a major clinical and
financial imperative in the NHS to reduce the complica￾tions post liver transplantation. The 1-year mortality fol￾lowing liver transplantation in the UK is 8.8% [27].
A recent analysis was carried out of complications fol￾lowing liver transplant at the Royal Free London NHS
Foundation Trust. Of 551 patients who underwent liver
transplantation from 1999 to 2008, 371 (67%) developed
at least one significant postoperative complication.
Those patients who developed a complication had a lon￾ger ICU stay (median of 3 versus 2 days) and longer hos￾pital length of stay (median of 33 versus 21 days) than
those who did not develop complications. Graft (trans￾planted liver) failure and mortality at 3 months postop￾eratively were also significantly higher in those with
complications. In a more detailed recent audit from
January 2011 to July 2012, data on 98 patients was ex￾amined. In this cohort 80% of patients developed at least
one significant postoperative complication, with a me￾dian of two complications per patient. This apparent in￾crease in postoperative complications is likely to reflect
an increase in the number of marginal organs now used
in liver transplantation and the increasing burden of
comorbidities.

Rationalising postoperative fluid therapy to prevent
iatrogenic harm and complications related to hyper- and
hypovolaemia, such as renal failure and pulmonary
oedema (Table 1), is an effective method of decreasing
postoperative complications in surgical patients [28]. A
goal-directed approach to fluid therapy using haemo￾dynamic monitoring appears to have promising results
in numerous randomised trials for elective and emer￾gency surgical patients [29]. Patients with cirrhosis
undergoing liver transplantation differ from the general
surgical population in several ways which makes them a
unique subset of patients.
Firstly, the disease process of cirrhosis entails a com￾plex neuro-endocrine and hormonal activation, such as
nitric oxide release and the renin-angiotensin system,
creating a hyperdynamic circulation [30]. The haemo￾dynamic physiology changes seen in cirrhosis (increased
cardiac output, reduced systemic vascular resistance and
effective central circulating blood volume) can last into
the first 24-h period after liver transplantation [31]. This
renders accurate assessment of intravascular volume sta￾tus an exceptionally difficult task. The mechanism and
timeline of alterations to these haemodynamic and
neuro-endocrine changes after liver transplantation have
not been adequately investigated. The COLT trial will
provide an opportunity to study the response to fluid
therapy in liver cirrhosis and investigate these underlying
mechanisms.
Secondly, there are surgery-related factors influencing
the patients’ haemodynamics after liver transplantation.
Liver transplantation is high-risk surgery incurring huge
surgical stress which is often prolonged in duration [32].
There are often pre-existing coagulation defects in cir￾rhotic patients with major blood loss during surgery re￾quiring transfusion of blood and blood products and
exacerbating the coagulopathy [8]. Major haemodynamic
alterations are exacerbated by cross-clamping of the in￾ferior vena cava during the transplant. Added to the sur￾gical stress, there is the huge burden of ischaemia￾reperfusion injury of the largest solid organ in the body
which can affect vascular endothelial barrier function,
activate inflammatory cascades and hence lead to un￾desired fluid shifts in the body and renal dysfunction
[33]. These factors make it difficult to institute a fixed
method of fluid assessment and replacement intraopera￾tively. Hence, in the COLT trial, the regimen of GDFT
was instituted during the initial 12-h period postopera￾tively rather than during the operation.
There have been a number of retrospective analyses of
the effect of fluid therapy on perioperative complications
after liver transplantation. However, there have been no
prospective randomised trials assessing GDFT post liver
transplantation. Jiang et al. reported that the intra￾operative fluid administration of > 100 mL/kg was
associated with an increased time to extubation and
length of ICU stay in a retrospective analysis of pulmon￾ary complications post liver transplantation [34]. An￾other retrospective analysis of 62 patients showed that
an intra-operative fluid infusion of > 9000 mL was a sig￾nificant risk factor for developing postoperative respira￾tory complications [34]. Reydellet et al. reported, in a
before and after retrospective study, that a GDFT ap￾proach for 2 days post liver transplantation results in de￾creased requirements for mechanical ventilation and
duration of postoperative ileus [35]. The COLT trial is
the first prospective RCT assessing GDFT in cirrhotic
patients undergoing liver transplantation.
