Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause
of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic stem cell trans￾plantation (alloSCT). In GVHD, mature donor T cells
that accompany the stem cell graft attack recipient tis￾sues, especially the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.
All patients, therefore, receive some type of GVHD pro￾phylaxis either by depletion of T cells from the allograft
or through pharmacologic treatment with agents that
impair T cell function. This GVHD prophylaxis has
adverse effects because mature donor T cells play a criti￾cal role in mediating reconstitution of the adaptive
immune system, especially in adults with diminished
thymic function (1–3). Thus, stem cell transplant recipi￾ents are at great risk for infections, particularly when pro￾longed immunosuppression is required for treatment of
acute and chronic GVHD. The difficulty in balancing
immune reconstitution versus GVHD prophylaxis has
prevented the more widespread application of allogeneic
stem cell transplantation to treat common inherited dis￾orders of hematopoiesis, such as sickle cell anemia and
thalassemia (4, 5). Donor T cells also play an important
role in eliminating neoplastic cells. This antitumor effect
has also proven difficult to deliver without GVHD.
In an effort to permit the safe engraftment of donor T
cells, much effort has focused on testing the GVHD￾inducing capacity of different T cell subsets. In particu￾lar, investigators have examined T1 or T2 T cell subsets
(6–10) and T cells lacking molecules for T cell effector
functions such as FasL, perforin, or TNF-α (11–14). In
general, impairment of individual pathways have result￾ed in moderation of GVHD, but these results have not
yet translated into widely applicable clinical protocols.
Peripheral T cells can also be broadly divided into
those that have never been activated by antigen (naive
T cells) and antigen-experienced T cells, which include
effector, central memory, and effector memory cells
(15–18). To date, these subpopulations have not been
tested in murine models of alloSCT. It is attractive to
consider the selective transfer of memory T cells. Most
donors have been exposed to common pathogens and

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Donor T cells that accompany stem cell grafts cause GVHD by
attacking recipient tissues; therefore, all patients receive GVHD prophylaxis by depletion of T cells
from the allograft or through immunosuppressant drugs. In addition to providing a graft-versus￾leukemia effect, donor T cells are critical for reconstituting T cell–mediated immunity. Ideally, immu￾nity to infectious agents would be transferred from donor to host without GVHD. Most donors have
been exposed to common pathogens and have an increased precursor frequency of memory T cells
against pathogenic antigens. We therefore asked whether memory CD62L–CD44+ CD4+ T cells would
induce less GVHD than unfractionated or naive CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we found that memory CD4
cells induced neither clinical nor histologic GVHD. This effect was not due to the increased number
of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells found in the CD62L–CD44+ fraction because memory T cells deple￾tion of these cells did not cause GVHD. Memory CD4 cells engrafted and responded to antigen both
in vivo and in vitro. If these murine results are applicable to human alloSCT, selective administra￾tion of memory T cells could greatly improve post-transplant immune reconstitution.

already have an increased precursor frequency of mem￾ory T cells that can respond quickly when rechallenged
with antigen. There are reasons to think that memory
T cells would be more potent at inducing GVHD than
naive T cells, however. When challenged by antigen,
memory T cells enter the cell cycle and produce
cytokines more rapidly than do naive T cells (15, 16,
19). Memory cells may also have less stringent APC
requirements, and thus allospecific memory T cells
that do not contact professional APCs might also
expand and participate in GVHD reactions (20). Mem￾ory T cells also undergo more rapid homeostatic pro￾liferation in irradiated recipients than do naive T cells
(21). Memory T cells might have a skewed T cell recep￾tor repertoire, which could either increase or decrease
GVHD. On the other hand, naive cells could be more
potent at GVHD induction because they uniformly
express CD62L and CCR7, which promotes T cell traf￾ficking into secondary lymphoid tissues where they can
encounter APCs presenting alloantigens. A potentially
more diverse repertoire in naive cells may also enhance
the ability of this subset to cause GVHD. If either naive
or memory cells were less potent in GVHD induction,
then this could open an avenue for mediating T
cell–immune reconstitution and graft-versus-leukemia
(GVL) with less toxicity from GVHD.
While there is no unequivocal definition of naive and
memory T cells, investigators have correlated immuno￾phenotype with naive or memory cell properties. Naive
and memory T cells are thought to be enriched in the
CD44–CD62L+ and CD44+CD62L– fractions, respec￾tively. For convenience, throughout this paper we will
refer to these cells as “naive” and “memory,” recogniz￾ing that these populations are not homogeneous.
Nonetheless, the fact that these phenotypic markers
segregate naive and memory cells made it feasible to test
whether CD44–CD62L+ and CD44+CD62L– T cells have
different capacities to cause GVHD.
We found that in a CD4-dependent, MHC-identical,
multiple minor histocompatibility antigen–incompat￾ible (miHA-incompatible) model of chronic GVHD,
memory CD4 cells do not cause GVHD. In contrast,
naive T cells are potent inducers of GVHD. We also
show that this difference is not due to the increased
number of CD4+CD25+ cells in the memory fraction,
which have been implicated in regulation of various
immunopathologic situations, including GVHD
(22–26). We believe these results could have important
clinical implications because memory cells could be
capable of mediating immune reconstitution and pos￾sibly GVL with less GVHD.
Methods
Mice. Recipient 8– to 12-week-old male BALB/c (H-2d)
and donor male 8- to 12-week-old B10.D2 (H-2d) mice
were purchased from NCI Laboratories (Frederick,
Maryland, USA) and The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Har￾bor, Maine, USA), respectively. Adult-thymectomized
male BALB/c recipients were purchased from Taconic
Farms (Germantown, New York, USA) and rested 3
weeks prior to transplant. Mice were housed in microiso￾lator cages and fed nonautoclaved food and acidified
water containing sulfatrim for 2 weeks after transplant.
GVHD model. Recipient BALB/c mice received 700–850
cGy from a cesium irradiator (see legends for individual
experiments) and were reconstituted with 8 × 106 B10.D2
T cell–depleted bone marrow with spleen cells or purified
naive or memory CD4+ T cells as described below.
Bone marrow T cell depletion. Bone marrow (BM) cells
were collected by flushing femurs and tibias from
B10.D2 donor mice into MACS buffer (1× PBS, 5 mM
EDTA, 3% calf serum). After red blood cell lysis, BM
cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-Thy1.2
(30H12) mAb for 20 minutes on ice, washed once, then
incubated with streptavidin-conjugated microbeads
(SA-beads; Miltenyi Biotech GmbH, Bergisch Glad￾bach, Germany) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Cells were
depleted of Thy1.2-positive cells using an AutoMACS
(Miltenyi Biotech GmbH). Remaining Thy1.2-positive
cells were routinely less than 0.5% of BM cells. Cells
were resuspended in injection buffer (1× PBS, 10 mM
HEPES, 2.5% acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant, 0.5%
penicillin-streptomycin) prior to transplant.
T cell purifications. B10.D2 spleens were crushed through
70-µm screens in MACS buffer. After red blood cell lysis,
spleen cells were resuspended in injection buffer prior to
transplant or underwent further cell purifications.
CD4 cells were enriched from total spleen cells using
BioMag (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) cell separation as
follows. Cells were incubated with the following Ab
supernatants for 30 minutes on ice, followed by two
washes in MACS buffer: anti-CD8-α (TIB105), anti￾B220 (RA3-6B2), anti–Mac-1 (M1/70), and anti-FcR
(24G.2). Cells were incubated with prepared BioMag
goat anti-rat magnetic beads for 30 minutes on ice in a
T75 or T125 flask, which was then placed next to a
strong magnet. Cells not bound to magnetic particles
were collected and were typically 70–80% CD4+ without
contaminating CD8+, B220+, CD11b+, or FcR+ cells.
For initial separations of naive and memory cells,
enriched CD4+ T cells were incubated with mAb’s
anti–CD4-APC/Cy7 (GK1.5; Caltag Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, California, USA), anti–CD62L-FITC 
(Mel-14; lab prepared), anti–CD44-APC (Pgp-1; BD
PharMingen, San Diego, California, USA) for 20 minutes
on ice, washed once in MACS buffer, and resuspended in
sort buffer (1× PBS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% calf serum, and
1× gentamicin). Cells were separated into CD62L+CD44–
naive and CD62L–CD44+ memory populations using a
FACSVantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson Immuno￾cytometry Systems, San Jose, California, USA).
Two procedures were used for the purification of
CD25– naive and memory cells. In the first, spleen cells
enriched for CD4+ T cells were stained with anti–CD4–
APC-Cy7, anti–CD62L-FITC, anti–CD44-APC, and
biotin anti–CD25 (7D4; BD PharMingen) for 20 min￾utes on ice, washed once in MACS buffer, and incubat￾ed with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (streptavidin-PE)

(Intergen Co., Purchase, New York, USA) for 15 min￾utes on ice, washed again, and resuspended in sort
buffer. Gated CD4+CD25– cells were separated into
CD62L+CD44– naive and CD62L–CD44+ memory sub￾sets using a FACSVantage.
In the second approach, separation of CD25+ and
CD25– naive and memory CD4+ T cells was achieved by
first incubating BioMag-enriched CD4+ T cells with
biotinylated anti-CD62L and biotinylated anti-CD25
cells for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed once in
MACS buffer and then incubated with SA-beads for 25
minutes at 4°C. Cells were separated on the AutoMACs
into CD62L+CD25+ and CD62L–CD25– fractions. The
negative fraction (CD62L–CD25–) was used as memory
cells. The positive fraction, containing CD62L+CD25+
cells, was incubated with anti–CD4-APC-Cy7, anti–
CD62L-FITC, anti–CD44-APC, and anti–CD25-PE for
20 minutes on ice, washed once in MACS buffer, and
resuspended in sort buffer. Naive CD4+CD62L+CD25–
cells were then isolated on a FACStar cell sorter (Becton
Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems).
Immunizations. Donor B10.D2 mice were immunized
by intraperitoneal injection with 50 µg chicken γ globu￾lin (CGG; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.,
West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) in CFA (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Missouri, USA) 3 weeks prior to transplanta￾tion. Adult thymectomized (ATX) BALB/c mice under￾went a GVHD-inducing transplant as described above,
using CGG-immunized B10.D2 mice as BM and CD4+ T
cell donors. Mice received (a) no CD4 cells, (b) CD25–
memory CD4 cells, or (c) unfractionated CD4 cells. Thir￾ty-seven days after transplant, recipients were immu￾nized with either 50 µg CGG or pigeon cytochrome c
(PCC; an irrelevant control antigen) in CFA by foot-pad
and tail-base subcutaneous injections. Unmanipulated
ATX mice were also immunized as a control.
Lymphocyte proliferation assay. Draining LN cells were
collected from transplanted and unmanipulated ATX
BALB/c mice 14 days after immunization. Prior to the
LN collection, ATX recipient mice were inspected for
the absence of a thymus to ensure complete thymecto￾my. Cells from each experimental group were pooled,
and residual recipient cells from transplanted groups
were depleted using MACS depletion with recipient-spe￾cific biotinylated anti-Ly9.1 (clone 30C7; BD PharMin￾gen). Residual contaminating Ly9.1+ cells were less than
1% of total. Cells were resuspended in complete Click’s
media (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, California, USA) with 5%
FCS (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, California,
USA), 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,
50 µg/ml gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.0568
mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Conventional T lymphocyte
proliferation assays were performed (106 cells/well); all
assays were set up with triplicate samples and incubat￾ed with media only (no antigen), CGG titrations (12.5
µg, 25 µg, or 50 µg), or 15 µg PPD (Mycobacterium tuber￾culosis H37 RA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan,
USA) for 72 hours. Lymphocyte proliferation was
assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation (1 µCi/well;
ICN Radiochemicals Inc., Irvine, California, USA) dur￾ing the last 16 hours of culture. Sample wells were har￾vested onto filters, and incorporated radioactivity was
counted in a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter
(LKB/Wallac, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA).
GVHD clinical-scoring system. Animals were weighed
every 3 days following BM transplantation and scored
for skin manifestations of GVHD beginning on day 18.
The scoring system was as follows: skin ulcers with
alopecia less than 1 cm2 in area = 1; skin ulcers with
alopecia 1–2 cm2 in area = 2; skin ulcers with alopecia
greater than 2 cm2 in area = 3; mice lacking skin ulcers
and alopecia received a score of 0. Additionally, animals
were assigned 0.3 point each for skin disease (ulcers or
scaling) on ears, tails, and paws. Thus, the minimum
score was 0, and the maximum score was 3.9. Incidence
is graphed as percentage of mice that have never achieved
a clinical score of 0.6 or greater. Once a mouse has had a
score of at least 0.6, it is always considered affected, even
if GVHD subsides to a score of less than 0.6. We also
plotted disease severity of an experimental group, which
is the mean clinical score of all mice in that group that
were affected by GVHD (i.e., have had a score of 0.6 or
greater). When mice either died or were euthanized for
humane reasons, their disease severity scores at time of
death remained included in subsequent mean scores.
Pathologic scoring. Shaved skin from the interscapular
region (approximately 2 cm2) was fixed in 10% forma￾lin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, slide mounted,
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were
scored by a dermatopathologist (J. McNiff; blinded to
experimental groups) on the basis of dermal fibrosis,
fat loss, inflammation, epidermal interface changes,
and follicular drop-out (0–2 for each category).
Statistical methods. The significance of differences in
GVHD incidence was calculated as a χ2 at the last
observation day as no events occurred in the memory
T cell recipients. The significance of differences
between clinical scores and pathology scores were cal￾culated by Mann-Whitney. Significance of differences
in proliferation were calculated by an unpaired t test.
Results
Memory CD4 cells do not cause GVHD. To compare the
GVHD-inducing potency of naive and memory T cells, we
used the B10.D2 (H-2d) → BALB/c (H-2d) model of
chronic GVHD. In this model CD4 cells are both required
and sufficient for GVHD, whereas, in contrast, CD8 cells
alone are incapable of causing GVHD (27, 28). The syn￾drome induced with purified CD4 cells is indistinguish￾able from that induced by unfractionated splenocytes. In
this model, GVHD is primarily cutaneous, manifested by
alopecia, erythema, ulceration, and fibrosis.
Naive and memory phenotype CD4 cells were puri￾fied by magnetically depleting B cells and granulocytes
from spleens, followed by FACS sorting. Naive CD4
cells were defined as CD62L+CD44–, whereas memory
cells were CD62L–CD44+ (Figure 1). BALB/c recipients
were irradiated and reconstituted with B10.D2 T

cell–depleted BM along with no T cells, 107 unfrac￾tionated spleen cells containing 1.2 × 106 CD4 cells, 106
memory CD4 cells, or 106 naive CD4 cells.
Strikingly, in two independent experiments, memory
CD4 cells did not induce clinical or histologic GVHD,
while naive CD4 cells caused more severe GVHD than
unfractionated splenocytes containing a greater num￾ber of CD4 cells (Figure 1, d–f). Between the two exper￾iments, a total of ten mice received memory cells, and
none developed GVHD. In contrast, 19 of 20 recipients
of naive cells and 23 of 25 spleen cell recipients devel￾oped GVHD (P < 0.0001 for both memory versus spleen
and memory versus naive). Affected naive CD4 recipi￾ents had a mean clinical score of 2.5 compared with 1.5
in spleen cell recipients (P < 0.05 for time points 1–3; 
P < 0.01 for time points 4–6). Memory cell recipients
had a score of 0 (P < 0.05 for time point 1 and P < 0.001
for time points 2–10, memory versus spleen; P < 0.0001
for all time points, memory versus naive). Histologi￾cally, memory cell recipients had scores indistinguish￾able from hosts that received no T cells. In contrast,
recipients of spleen cells and naive T cells had mean
scores of 5.2 and 5.9, respectively (P < 0.005, memory
versus spleen; P < 0.0004, memory versus naive cells).
Thus, GVHD in this model is induced only by naive
and not memory CD4 cells. The differences in clinical
scores between naive and spleen cell recipients were not
reflected by histologic analysis of affected skin as the
clinical score measures the extent of skin involvement.
The nature of the lesions in affected skin was quanti￾tatively and qualitatively similar in the total spleen cell
and naive groups.
Memory CD4 cells depleted of regulatory CD4+CD25+ cells
do not cause GVHD. Differential GVHD-inducing capac￾ity could be an intrinsic property of naive and memory
T cells. Alternatively, the CD44+CD62L– population
that contains memory T cells might also contain a reg￾ulatory cell that suppresses GVHD that is not present
among the naive cell population. Potential candidate
regulatory cells include CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells
(Treg), which have been shown to suppress GVHD in
MHC-incompatible GVHD models (22–24). We there￾fore enumerated the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells
present in B10.D2 naive and memory CD4 cells. We
found that 5.5% of naive cells and 33% of memory CD4
cells were CD25+ (Figure 2). Thus, memory cells could
have been less efficacious at inducing GVHD due to the
large number of putative Treg cells present.
To evaluate this possibility, we performed GVHD
experiments with naive and memory CD4+ T cells that
were depleted of CD4+CD25+ cells (see Methods). In two
independent experiments (Figures 3 and 4), 106 memo￾ry CD4 cells depleted of CD4+CD25+ cells did not cause
GVHD, whereas an equal number (Figure 3) or only
250,000 naive CD4 cells (Figure 4) caused severe GVHD.
In the first experiment, naive and memory CD25– cells
were isolated by FACS sorting (Figure 3, a–d). Irradiat￾ed BALB/c hosts received 8 × 106 B10.D2 T cell–deplet￾ed BM with no T cells, 2 × 106 unfractionated CD4 cells,
and 106 naive or 106 memory CD4 cells. As in our exper￾iments with CD25-replete naive and memory cells,
CD25– memory CD4 cells did not cause GVHD, where￾as naive CD25– cells caused more severe GVHD than did
an equal number of unfractionated CD4 cells (Figure 3,
e–g). Differences in GVHD incidence between recipients
of memory versus naive (P < 0.0005) and memory ver￾sus total CD4 cells (P < 0.008) were highly significant.
In the second experiment, naive and memory CD25–
cells were isolated by MACS depletion to obtain mem￾ory cells, followed by FACS sorting to obtain naive cells
Figure 1
Memory CD4+ T cells do not cause GVHD. Naive and memory T cells
were purified as described in Methods. After gating on CD4+ T cells (a),
cells were sorted into CD62L+CD44– naive and CD62L–
CD44+ memo￾ry fractions (b). Reanalyses of sorted populations are shown in (c).
BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with 8 × 106
B10.D2 T cell–depleted BM alone (thin dashed line, n = 9) or with 107
B10.D2 total spleen cells (thin solid line, n = 25), 106 naive T cells (thick
solid line, n = 20), or 106 memory T cells (thick dashed line, n = 10).
Data are combined from two independent experiments. GVHD inci￾dence and mean clinical score are shown in d and e. Statistical com￾parisons are as follows: (d). P < 0.0001 for GVHD incidence in recipi￾ents of memory CD4 versus spleen cells or naive CD4 cells. (e) For
clinical score, *P < 0.05 (time points 1–3) and ‡P < 0.01 (time points
4–6) for recipients of naive versus total spleen cells; †P < 0.05. §P < 0.001
(time points 2–10) for recipients of memory versus total spleen cells. 
P < 0.0001 for recipients of memory versus naive cells at all time
points. BM control mice and BM plus memory cell groups did not get
GVHD, but the clinical score lines were offset for clarity. Pathology
scores from representative mice are shown in (f). Mean scores are
indicated by horizontal bars. ††P < 0.005 and P < 0.0004 for recipi￾ents of memory versus total (unfractionated) spleen cells and mem￾ory versus naive CD4 cells, respectively.

Engrafted memory CD4 cells respond to antigen in vivo. For
donor memory T cell infusions to be effective in
immune reconstituting alloSCT recipients, they must
engraft and be able to respond to antigen. We could not
ask this in the experiments described above because
memory CD4 cell recipients also had donor BM-derived
T cells. To evaluate memory donor CD4 cell engraft￾ment and function, we therefore used ATX BALB/c
mice as recipients. Because donor BM-derived cells can￾not differentiate into T cells due to the absence of a thy￾mus, the only donor-derived T cells in these mice are
derived from those infused at the time of transplant.
Donor- and host-derived cells can be distinguished by
expression of the recipient-specific Ly9.1 isoform.
To mimic the situation of a recipient responding to an
antigen against which the donor has already been
exposed, we used B10.D2 mice that were immunized 21
days prior to transplant with CGG as CD4+T cell and BM
donors. ATX BALB/c mice were irradiated and reconsti￾tuted with T cell–depleted B10.D2 BM, with (a) no CD4
cells, (b) unfractionated CD4 cells, or (c) CD25– memory
CD4+ T cells. To test functional in vivo memory of donor
T cells, recipients and unmanipulated ATX mice were
immunized on day 37 after transplant with CGG or the

(see Methods and Figure 4, a–d). Again, memory CD4
cells caused no clinical GVHD, whereas only 250,000
naive CD25– memory CD4 cells induced GVHD simi￾lar to that induced by 1.5 × 106 unfractionated CD4
cells (Figure 4, e–g). As in the first experiment, differ￾ences in GVHD incidence between recipients of mem￾ory cells versus naive cells (P < 0.0027) and memory ver￾sus total CD4 cells (P < 0.0002) were highly significant.
Thus, between the two experiments, none of the seven
mice that received CD25-depleted memory cells devel￾oped GVHD, whereas 14 of 14 recipients of CD25-
depleted naive cells got GVHD.
The clinical differences we observed were also borne
out histologically. Mice were sacrificed on day 42, and
skin histology was scored as described in Methods (Fig￾ure 3g and Figure 4g). Memory CD25– T cell recipients
had no evidence of GVHD, whereas recipients of total
unfractionated CD4 cells (including CD4+CD25+ cells)
and naive CD25– CD4 cells developed severe histologic
GVHD. Representative histology is shown in Figure 5.

CD25 expression on naive and memory CD4 subsets. B10.D2 spleen
cells enriched for CD4 cells as described in Methods were stained with
mAb’s against CD4, CD25, CD62L, and CD44. We found that 12.4%
of CD4 cells were CD25+ (a). We gated on CD62L+CD44– naive and
CD62L–CD44+ memory CD4 cells (b) and analyzed their expression
of CD25 (c and d). Note that 33.1% of cells with a memory pheno￾type express CD25 versus 5.1% of cells with a naive phenotype.

After gating on CD4+CD25– cells (a), T cells were sorted on the basis
of CD62L and CD44 expression (b). Reanalyses of sorted populations
are shown in (c) (CD44 versus CD62L) and (d) (CD4 versus CD25).

irrelevant control antigen PCC. Fourteen days later, mice
were sacrificed and draining lymph node cells were har￾vested. Residual recipient host cells were depleted (less
than 1% contaminating host cells), and the remaining
cells were restimulated in vitro with CGG. Proliferation
was measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation.
As in previous experiments, memory T cell recipients
did not develop clinical GVHD (Figure 6a), whereas
most recipients of unfractionated CD4 cells did. Donor
memory T cells engrafted, with 75% of LN CD4 cells
being Ly9.1– and therefore derived from the mature
donor T cells given at the time of transplant. These
memory cells made strong proliferative recall responses
to CGG, even greater than those made by recipients of
unfractionated CD4 cells. This is particularly striking
because the fraction of CD4+ T cells in the memory
group was only one-third of that in the unfractionated
CD4 cell group (not shown). Memory recipients immu￾nized with PCC in vivo failed to respond to CGG in vitro,
which confirms that proliferation depended on in vivo
priming. Importantly, CGG-immunized recipients of T
cell-depleted BM had poor responses, demonstrating
that residual host CD4 cells could not have made a sig￾nificant contribution. Thus, donor memory CD4+ T cells
both engrafted and responded vigorously to antigen.
Discussion
These experiments show that in an MHC-compatible,
multiple miHA-incompatible murine model of CD4-
dependent chronic GVHD, donor memory cells alone
are ineffective in mediating GVHD. In contrast, an
equal or even a lower number of naive donor CD4 cells
induced severe GVHD. This difference was not due to
an effect of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells because we observed
similar results when we depleted these cells. Memory
CD4 cells engrafted and were able to mount strong
proliferative recall responses when challenged in vivo.
If translatable to humans, these results could have an
important clinical impact. AlloSCT recipients could
potentially receive substantial numbers of donor mem￾ory T cells, leading to immune reconstitution with a
lower risk of GVHD. These cells might also be capable
of mediating antitumor effects, an issue that will have
to be addressed in future studies.
There are several potential explanations for why
memory T cells failed to induce GVHD. In general, the
differences we observed could be due to differences in
T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, intrinsic properties of
memory T cells, or both. It is presumed that T cells
with a memory phenotype have responded to environ￾mental antigens. Thus, the TCR repertoire could be
altered such that the immunodominant miHAs tar￾geted by naive T cells are not recognized by memory
cells. It is also possible that the primary stimulation
that created these memory cells polarized them toward
a T1 or T2 response, and if these phenotypes were pre￾served on restimulation (29), this could account for
the decreased GVHD. Using a number of approaches,

AutoMACS- and FACS-sorted CD25-depleted memory T cells do not cause GVHD. Donor B10.D2 spleen cells enriched for CD4+ T cells
using BioMag beads were stained with biotinylated anti-CD62L and anti-CD25 mAb’s, followed by staining with SA-beads. Cells were sep￾arated into CD25–CD62L– (negative [neg] fraction) and CD25+CD62L+ (positive [pos] fraction) cells using an AutoMACS. Phenotype of pre￾sort CD4+ T cells is shown in (a). Phenotype of CD25–CD62L– negative fraction (memory cells) is shown in (b). CD25+CD62L+ cells (posi￾tive fraction) were sorted on a FACStar cell sorter to purify CD25– (c) and CD62L+CD44– cells (d). Reanalysis of the sorted population is not
available. BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with 8 × 106 B10.D2 T cell–depleted BM alone (thin dashed line, n = 5) or
with 1.5 × 106 unfractionated B10.D2 CD4+ T cells (thin solid line, n = 10), 2.5 × 105 CD4+CD25– naive T cells (thick solid line, n = 5), or 106
CD4+CD25– memory T cells (thick dashed line, n = 4). Incidence of GVHD (e). P < 0.0002 and P < 0.003 for difference between recipients
of CD25– memory and total CD4 and CD25– naive CD4 cells, respectively. Average clinical disease score for mice affected with GVHD (f).

however, we have not seen evidence that either T1 or
T2 cells are exclusively required for GVHD in this
model (our unpublished observations). In addition,
memory T cells might not traffic efficiently to sec￾ondary lymphoid organs. At least some memory T cells
did traffic to lymph nodes, however, because memory
CD4 cell recipients mounted proliferative responses to
CGG. This is consistent with data on the responsive￾ness of memory CD4 cells transferred in nontrans￾plant settings (30). Finally, the population that
includes memory T cells could contain a regulatory T
cell population other than CD4+CD25+ cells. These
possibilities will need to be addressed in a series of
future experiments that will require unique genetics to
distinguish donor-engrafted mature T cells from
donor marrow–derived newly generated T cells.
While memory cells are clearly less potent at induc￾ing GVHD, they may still be capable of doing so under
certain conditions. In other GVHD models, immuniz￾ing T cell donors with recipient antigens reduces the
number of T cells required for GVHD induction (28).
In these cases, however, the precursor frequency of
alloreactive cells would be greatly increased. Thus, even
though memory T cells from immune mice mediate
GVHD, they may be less effective at inducing GVHD
than naive T cells bearing the same TCRs on a per cell
basis. Furthermore, GVHD in these experiments may
have been caused by persistent activated effectors
rather than memory cells, since donor cell purifications
were not performed.
Naive T cells, with or without CD25+ cells, were more
potent than unfractionated cells and caused more severe
GVHD. Approximately 10% of unfractionated CD4 cells
are CD25+ as compared with 5.5% of naive CD4 cells. It
is therefore possible that a reduction in CD25+ cells from
10% to 5.5% that accompanies naive cell purification
accounts for this difference. Alternatively, differences in
regulatory activity among subsets of CD4+CD25+ cells
could account for this. CD4+CD25+CD62L+CD44– cells
could be less efficacious in suppressing GVHD than are
CD4+CD25+CD62L–CD44+ cells. Against this idea,
CD62L+ and CD62L– CD4+CD25+ cells were equally effi￾cacious in suppressing T cell proliferation in vitro (31),
though to our knowledge they have not yet been com￾pared in vivo. Finally, as mentioned above, a regulatory
cell that is CD25– may also be among cells with a
CD62L–CD44+ phenotype, and the exclusion of this cell
from the naive population could account for its greater
potency compared with unfractionated cells. We think it
is unlikely that naive cells are resistant to the activity of
CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells because it appears that
most, if not all, of the GVHD-inducing activity in this
model resides in the naive population, and depletion of
CD25+ cells from CD4 cells results in more severe GVHD
(our unpublished observations).
If memory CD4 cells cause less GVHD than unfrac￾tionated CD4 cells in human alloSCT recipients, selec￾tive administration of memory T cells could greatly
improve immune reconstitution, as was the case in our
murine model. The importance of donor immunity in
reconstituting host immunity in human alloSCT is
dramatically demonstrated by the increased incidence

of EBV-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative dis￾orders (PTLDs) in recipients of T cell–depleted allo￾grafts as compared with recipients of T cell–replete
grafts. Infusions of donor T cells from EBV-immune
donors induce regressions of PTLDs (32). Adaptive
immunotherapy with ex vivo–generated donor T cells
specific for CMV or EBV have been effectively used to
reconstitute anti-CMV immunity and treat PTLD (29,
33–36). Such a practice is not likely to become wide￾spread due to the cost and technical difficulties in gen￾erating these cells. Transfer of a smaller number of nat￾urally occurring donor memory cells might be a more
widely applicable approach. Not only would the pre￾cursor frequency of cells that can respond to infectious
pathogens be increased, immunosuppressive therapy
that restricts their function might also be reduced, if
not eliminated. Such an approach would be particu￾larly important for adult patients, in which the major￾ity of T cell reconstitution is mediated by donor T cells
rather than by thymically derived T cells (1), especially
in those patients with GVHD (37).
