Abstract
Pulmonary oxygen toxicity plays an important role in the lung
injury process that leads to the development of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a fibroblast
mitogen and promoter of collagen deposition. We investigated the
effects of postnatal hyperoxia on lung collagen and CTGF expression
in rats. Rat pups were exposed to 7 d of >95% O2 and a further 3
wk of 60% O2. CTGF mRNA and protein expression increased after
hyperoxia treatment, and the values were significantly higher in
hyperoxia-exposed rats on postnatal d 7 and 14. Lung collagen
levels increased as rats aged, and the values were comparable
between room air-exposed and hyperoxia-exposed rats on postnatal


d 7 and 14 and were significantly higher in hyperoxia-exposed rats
on postnatal d 21 and 28. Increases in CTGF mRNA and protein
expressions preceded the onset of increased lung collagen. These
data demonstrate that CTGF is up-regulated at time points
preceding the fibrotic phase of the lung injury adding credence to
the hypothesis that CTGF seems to be involved in the pathogenesis
of hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis and an anti-CTGF strategy might
attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis.
