Abstract
Everolimus (EVL) and Sirolimus (SRL) are potent immunosuppressant agents belonging to the group of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors used to prevent transplant rejection. However, some patients develop
proteinuria following a switch from a calcineurin inhibitor regimen to mTOR inhibitors. Whether different mTOR
inhibitors show similar effects on podocytes is still unknown. To analyze this, human podocytes were incubated with
different doses of EVL and SRL. After incubation with EVL or SRL, podocytes revealed a reduced expression of total
mTOR. Phosphorylation of p70S6K and Akt was diminished, whereas pAkt expression was more reduced in the SRL
group. In both groups actin cytoskeletal reorganization was increased. Synaptopodin and podocin expression was
reduced as well as nephrin protein, particularly in the SRL group. NFκB activation and IL-6 levels were lower in EVL
and SRL, and even lower in SRL. Apoptosis was more increased in SRL than in the EVL group. Our data suggests
that mTOR inhibitors affect podocyte integrity with respect to podocyte proteins, cytoskeleton, inflammation, and
apoptosis. Our study is the first to analyze both mTOR inhibitors, EVL and SRL, in parallel in podocytes. Partially, the
impact of EVL and SRL on podocytes differs. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether these differences are of
relevance regarding to proteinuria in transplant patients.

Introduction
The mechanism of action of Everolimus (EVL) and Sirolimus
(SRL) is based on the inhibition of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), a multiprotein complex [1,2] that directly
influences protein synthesis and cell cycle progression. Both,
EVL and SRL are used in transplant therapy to prevent
rejection. One advantage of mTOR inhibitors over calcineurin
inhibitors (CNI) is that they do not induce an increase in blood
pressure and only cause mild nephrotoxicity [3]. This is of
clinical interest, because CNI-induced nephrotoxicity is one of
the prominent side effects in kidney, as well as heart
transplantations [4,5]. Ten years after organ transplantation,
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy leads to end-stage renal
disease in up to 20% of all heart transplant patients [6,7].
Nevertheless, it has been reported that some patients treated
with mTOR inhibitors suffer from acute rejection, delayed graft
function (DGF), and proteinuria [8-11]. The proteinuria could
arise from the reorganization and degradation process of the
podocytes. Generally, proteinuria is caused by a remodelling of
the glomerular filter apparatus, in particular through
morphological and functional changes of the podocytes, such
as cytoskeletal rearrangements and foot process effacement
[12].
In this context, it is of special interest to determine whether
podocyte damage is dose dependently altered by EVL and
SRL and whether there are differences of the two agents.
Although EVL and SRL are both known to cause proteinuria
[3,13], a single substance analysis in parallel with regard to the
podocytes has not been performed either in vitro or in vivo.
Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of mTOR
inhibitor-induced podocyte damage, and demonstrate the
impact of EVL and SRL on mTOR signaling on human
podocytes.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture of Podocytes
Conditionally immortalized human podocyte cells AB8/13
were cultured as described elsewhere [14]. In brief, podocytes
were maintained at 33°C (permissive conditions). To induce
differentiation, podocytes were cultured at 37°C (non￾permissive conditions). After 14 days under non-permissive
conditions, the cells revealed an arborized shape and
expressed synaptopodin and podocin, which was shown by
immunofluorescence or western blot analysis. The passages
between 11 and 20 were used for this.
Incubation of Podocytes with mTOR Inhibitors
For incubation experiments, podocytes were serum deprived
in differentiation medium containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h.
Afterwards, the cells were incubated for 48 h with EVL
(Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) and SRL (Sigma￾Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in starvation medium. All
experiments were repeated at least three times in each
indicated condition. Concentrations of EVL and SRL between
0‑100 nM were used as kinetics and of 20 nM for direct
comparison. As negative controls, we used untreated control
cells (=CØ) and solvent ethanol control (=C). Puromycin
aminonucleoside (PAN) at 30 µg/ml (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) served as positive
control with regard to podocyte damage [15-17].
Cell Viability
The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) after incubation
with EVL and SRL or PAN was measured in cell culture
supernatants and assayed immediately for LDH using a
cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
Measurements were performed in triplicate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
A background control (providing information about the LDH
activity in the assay medium), a low control (spontaneous LDH
release), and a high control with 1% Triton X-100 (maximum
LDH release) were carried out as described before [18].
Cytotoxicity is given in percent.
Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence analysis, podocytes were grown in
duplicate on type I collagen‑coated glass coverslips (Sigma￾Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), fixed with either methanol or
3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and incubated with primary antibodies and appropriate
fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. For nuclear
staining, cells were stained with 0.1 mg/ml Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The following primary
antibodies were used: anti-nephrin, anti-podocin, anti￾synaptopodin, and anti-NFκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg, Germany), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Except for phalloidin
(Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany), which was directly
conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), antigen￾antibody complexes were visualized with DyLight 488 and Cy3-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg,
Germany). Negative control was performed by using PBS
instead of primary antibody. To analyze actin cytoskeleton
organization, the number of cells which revealed a cortical
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton was counted and the
total cell number was set to 100%. To analyze NFκB activation,
the nuclear signal of NFκB-activated cells was counted and the
total cell number was set to 100%.
Images were taken using a Nikon DS-Qi1Mc quantitative
black- and- white charge-coupled device camera attached to a
Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf,
Germany). The same contrast and intensity settings were
applied to samples stained with identical antibodies [19,20].
FACS Analysis
After experimental incubation, 1x106
 cells were collected
non-enzymatically and washed in 1% FCS-PBS; for
intracellular staining, they were fixed with 3% PFA for 30 min,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X for 5 min and stained for 1 h
at 4°C using a directly FITC labeled anti-synaptopodin antibody
(Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) and the respective isotype
control (FITC Mouse IgG1, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany). After final washing, cells were resuspended in PBS
and 104
 cells were acquired using a FACS Calibur Cytometer
(Becton-Dickinson). CellQuest Software 3.3 was used for the
analysis.
TUNEL
Apoptosis was analyzed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
(In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Following fixation in 3% buffered PFA, cells
were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
using FITC labeled nucleotides. Hoechst 33258 served as a
nuclear counterstain (blue); TUNEL positive cells (green) in
15–20 randomly selected fields were counted out of the total
number of cells.
Western Blot Analysis
Podocytes were serum starved for 24 h, incubated, lysed,
and the protein concentration was assessed using the Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Langenselbold,
Germany). Lysate (5–40 µg) was separated by 8–12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following
antibodies were used: anti-mTOR, anti-pAkt (Ser473) (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-p70S6K, anti-p￾p70S6K, anti-podocin, anti-synaptopodin, anti-RhoA, anit￾CDC42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany),
anti-Rac1 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti￾nephrin (C-terminus, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Equal loading
was verified by the detection of α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Deisenhofen, Germany). Protein detection was performed after
incubation with primary and peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies using a SuperSignal Pico detection kit (Pierce,
Bonn, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

software based analysis. The area under curve (AUC) of the
specific signal was corrected for the AUC of the loading control.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
IL-6 ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (human IL-6 ELISA kit, Bioscience, Inc., San
Diego, CA). In brief, cells were incubated and supernatants
were collected and diluted as described before [20].
Measurement was carried out at 450 nm using a Multiskan FC
ELISA reader (Thermo Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany).
Migration Assay
Differentiated podocytes were seeded in type I collagen￾coated six-well plates and pretreated with solvent control, 20
nM EVL and SRL, and PAN. Wounding was performed with a
200 µl tip that was cut longitudinally in the well. Live cell
recordings were performed immediately after wounding (0 h)
and 24 h after the scratch using the motor-controlled Nikon
Eclipse TE2000-E inverted microscope system (Nikon,
Düsseldorf, Germany). Analyses were performed with NIS
Elements AR 2.30 (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) by counting
the number of cells that had migrated into the sized fields [21].
For the statistical analysis, the wounded area from each well
was measured in duplicate at 6 random wound gap locations
per frame recorded per experiment.
Statistical Analysis
All of the data is shown as the mean (standard deviation) of
at least three independent experiments in each indicated
condition. The Mann-Whitney U test was carried out to test
statistical significance. The significance level was set to at least
P < 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed by PC-Statistik
(version 5.0; Hoffmann, Giessen, Germany) and GraphPad
Prism (version 4.03; San Diego, CA).
Results
Cell Viability
In comparison to the control podocytes, the EVL and SRL
group showed an increase in cytotoxicity. As expected, the
PAN group revealed the highest levels of LDH release (36.4%
± 16.8%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, cells incubated with SRL
exhibited higher values of cytotoxicity than those incubated
with EVL (EVL: 5.20% ± 5.22%; SRL: 12.3% ± 7.90%, P <
0.01).
Proteins of the MTOR Signaling Pathway
mTOR protein. On the molecular level, EVL and SRL inhibit
the multiprotein complex mTOR, which is the main component
of a signaling cascade linked to cell proliferation.
As shown by western blot analysis, podocytes treated with
increasing concentrations (0–100 nM) of EVL or SRL for 48 h
exhibited decreased expression of total mTOR protein. The
signal of solvent free control (CØ) and solvent control (C =
0 nM) did not reveal different intensities (Figure 1A, B). The
expression of mTOR in the EVL and SRL groups was lower
compared to control. PAN expression used as a positive
control with regard to general podocyte damage was even
lower. A comparison of EVL and SRL (20 nM) did not show any
differences in total mTOR protein (Figure 1C).

Downstream targets p70S6K and Akt. In the mTOR
signaling cascade, the phosphorylation of proteins belonging to
this pathway is of interest. Therefore, phosphorylation of the
downstream target p70S6K that acts downstream to mTOR
complex I was analyzed. We found diminished phosphorylation
when cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of
the immunosuppressant agents EVL and SRL, however, total
p70S6K remained constant (Figure 2A, B; Figure
S1A, A’, B, B’). EVL and SRL caused reduced phosphorylation
of p70S6K versus control; however, no differences were
observed in the agents themselves (Figure 2C; Figure
S1C, C’).
In contrast, phosphorylation of Akt at Serin 473, which is
another target in the mTOR pathway related to both, mTOR
complex I and II, showed a higher reduction in SRL compared
to EVL; almost no phosphorylation took place in PAN (Figure
2D¸ Figure S1D).
Expression of Slit Diaphragm Associated Proteins
Nephrin. In a clinical study, it was observed that SRL
application often leads to proteinuria. Moreover, it is known that
reduction of the slit diaphragm associated protein nephrin leads
to proteinuria in vivo [22,23]. Here, we observed that increasing
concentrations (0–100 nM) of EVL or SRL resulted in
decreased nephrin expression. The signal of solvent free
control (CØ) and solvent control (C = 0 nM) differed slightly
(Figure 3A, B; Figure S2A, B). When analyzing EVL and SRL
simultaneously, the western blot analysis showed that nephrin
expression was lower in SRL than in EVL (Figure 3C; Figure
S2C). These findings could be confirmed by
immunofluorescence staining, which revealed less nephrin
protein in SRL compared to EVL (Figure 3D, E).
Podocin. Mutations in the podocin gene NPHS2 cause
steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Of note, this syndrome is
accompanied by mild proteinuria, which has a delayed
occurrence and even begins years after birth in some cases
[24]. In our experiments, the impact of increasing
concentrations (0–100 nM) of EVL or SRL on podocytes leads
to lower podocin expression (Figure 4A, B). Podocin protein in
the EVL and SRL groups was reduced in a similar way in terms
of control; the effect of positive control PAN on deteriorated
podocin expression was most prominent (Figure 4C). For the
immunofluorescence analysis, comparable podocin staining in
SRL and EVL could be observed (Figure 4D, E).
Expression of Actin-Associated Proteins
Synaptopodin and RhoA. Synaptopodin is an actin￾associated protein of differentiated podocytes and part of the

(20 nM) in parallel (C); in contrast, expression of p-Akt (Ser473), a protein related to both mTOR complexes, was lower in SRL
compared to EVL (D); α-tubulin served as loading control; analyses of p70S6K derived from different blots. p-p70S6K =

actin-based contractile apparatus in the foot processes [25]. It
induces stress fibers by blocking the degradation of RhoA. In
contrast to RhoA two further members of the Rho family, Rac1
and CDC42, are highly expressed, even when synaptopodin is
missing [21].. In our western blot experiments, we found
decreased synaptopodin expression when podocytes were
incubated with increasing concentrations (0–100 nM) of EVL or
SRL. The signal of solvent free control (CØ) and solvent control
(C = 0 nM) did not reveal any differences (Figure 5A, B). In a
simultaneous analysis of EVL and SRL, the western blot
analysis showed that synaptopodin expression was slightly
lower in SRL than in EVL (Figure 5C; Figure S3). With regard
to RhoA, we also found diminished expression of EVL and
SRL, especially in the SRL group, meaning synaptopodin
increases total RhoA expression (Figure 5D) whereas, as
expected, the expression of the family members Rac1 and
CDC42 remained unchanged in all groups (Figure S4A, B). We
additionally analyzed synaptopodin expression by FACS
analysis, which revealed less synaptopodin in SRL compared
to EVL; the lowest expression of synaptopodin was present in
PAN (Figure 5E).
Organization of the Actin Cytoskeleton
The integrity of the cytoskeleton is important to preserve the
functional morphology of podocytes. For this, we analyzed the
actin cytoskeleton with respect to normal well-developed
podocyte stress fibers or a reorganized cortical actin fiber
phenotype using phalloidin staining. In our experiments, actin
cytoskeletal reorganization was increased in both mTOR
groups in comparison to control, but did not show any
differences between EVL and SRL. The highest numbers of
reorganized cells were found in the PAN group (Figure 6A, B).

Migration Assay
The dynamics of podocytes are associated with an intact
actin-based contractile apparatus and physiological expression
of synaptopodin [21]. To confirm that decreased synaptopodin
expression also impairs directed podocyte migration, we
performed a wound healing assay. After scratching, the wound
healing was the best in the control group. In contrast, in the
EVL and SRL groups, the number of migrated cells was
reduced and the lowest motility was observed in PAN (Figure
7A, B).
Inflammation
Regulation of NFκB. NFκB activation is known to go along
with an immune reaction resulting in an increased inflammatory
status. Immunosuppressant agents should suppress this
reaction. To test this, we analyzed the basal NFκB activation in
control cells; in both mTOR inhibitor groups, NFκB activation
was lower than in the control group and even more reduced in
SRL than ELV. This could hint to a higher impact of SRL on the
immune system than of EVL (Figure 8A, Figure S5). In the PAN
group, virtually no NFκB activation was observable since PAN
treated cells go directly into apoptosis (see Figure 9 below).
Interleukin-6. NFκB activation was lower in both mTOR
inhibitor groups as well as IL-6 excretion was reduced. Analysis
of the IL-6 levels showed that IL-6 excretion was diminished
especially in the SRL group compared to the EVL group. Basal
IL-6 expression is reflected in the control group, whereas
almost no IL-6 expression is detectable in the PAN group
(Figure 8B).

podocin (D) and analysis (E) did not show any changes in podocin protein in SRL compared to EVL. Magnification 400×, scale bar

Apoptosis
To analyze apoptotic events, a TUNEL assay was
performed, as well as immunofluorescence analysis of
activated caspase-3. The number of TUNEL positive and
activated caspase-3 positive cells was increased in both mTOR
inhibitor groups as compared to control. Even more apoptotic
events could be detected in SRL compared to EVL. As
expected, the highest apoptosis was demonstrated in the PAN
group (Figure 9, Figure S6).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first, which
investigates the impact of EVL and SRL in parallel on a cell
culture model of human podocytes. Our results shed new light
on the differences in podocyte damage mediated dose
dependently by either EVL or SRL. However, one has to
remember that our analysis was performed in a podocyte cell
culture system, where the natural microenvironment and
thereby possible interactions are lacking.
When we incubated our cells for 48 h, we had to keep in
mind that the half-life of EVL and SRL is different, it is 62 ± 16
h for SRL [26] and only 16-19 h for EVL [27]. Nevertheless,
EVL with a shorter half-life than the 48 h incubation period
rapidly diffuses into cells where it binds to its binding protein
FKBP12 and is thus protected from degradation [28]. Since our
approach has not been used before, we first had to find the
appropriate dose to compare both reagents using
concentration kinetics. Earlier studies conducted used doses of
EVL or SRL ranging from 10 nm and 100 nm for 24 h to 120 h
[29-31]. Given that concentrations of EVL and SRL of as low as
20 nM already result in strong mTOR inhibition, we decided to
use a concentration of 20 nM to perform simultaneous analysis
of EVL and SRL as the therapeutic dose, at least in renal
transplant patients, correlates to 20 nM of mTOR
immunosuppressant [32].
We incubated the cells with EVL and SRL and started by
analyzing the mTOR pathway. Mechanistically, to act
downstream of mTOR complex I, the target p70S6K needs to
be sequentially activated by phosphorylation [33]. We found
that this phosphorylation process was inhibited by EVL and
SRL with no differences in the phosphorylation grade
observable between the two agents; this demonstrates an
efficient inhibition of mTOR complex I using EVL and SRL in
podocytes. The situation is different regarding the
phosphorylation of Akt. Akt is a protein related to both mTOR
complexes. On the one hand, mTOR complex I can activate
Akt indirectly following a negative feedback loop [34,35]; on the
other hand, Akt can be directly phosphorylated via complex II.
The simultaneous analysis of EVL and SRL demonstrated a
stronger reduction of the phosphorylation of Akt in SRL treated
podocytes, which hints to a higher effect of SRL on mTOR
complex II and had been observed by Letavernier et al. after
SRL incubation as well [30]. The question arose whether there
are differences of EVL and SRL in podocytes besides those in
the mTOR signaling pathway, particularly regarding to
cytotoxicity, podocyte proteins, and apoptosis.
Our LDH assay revealed a high cytotoxicity in both mTOR
inhibitor groups in comparison to control; interestingly, LDH
release in the SRL group was higher than in the EVL group. At
this point the literature is not concordant. Keller et al. and
Letavernier et al. e.g. did not find cytotoxicity under mTOR

regimen, in contrast to Vollenbrökers findings as well as to ours
[29-31]. Our conclusion is therefore, that the toxic potential of
SRL on podocytes might be more pronounced than that of
EVL. To elucidate the toxic capacity on podocytes of both
agents, the slit diaphragm associated protein nephrin was
analyzed next. It is known that the reduction or absence of
nephrin, e.g., due to mutations in the NPHS1 gene, causes
severe disorders, which ultimately result in massive proteinuria
[24]. In our analyses, the expression of nephrin was markedly
decreased in cells incubated with EVL and SRL, and more
pronounced in SRL. This is in line with a recent study by
Vollenbröker et al. in which a reduced nephrin expression was
observable after SRL administration [31].
In contrast to nephrin, mutations in the podocin gene NPHS2
are associated with less proteinuria, which occurs after years
[24]. In accordance with these findings, we observed

mTOR Inhibitors and Podocytes
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80340

decreased podocin expression in both mTOR inhibitor groups,
but no differences in the simultaneous analysis of EVL and
SRL at 48 h.
Another important podocyte specific protein is synaptopodin.
Mechanistically, it stores podocyte integrity by blocking the
degradation of RhoA, which induces stress fiber formation [21].
In our experiments, the expression of synaptopodin and RhoA
was not as strong in the SRL group compared to EVL. Since a
lack of synaptopodin is known to induce proteinuria [36], this
finding might be clinically relevant as Letavernier et al.
demonstrated in renal biopsies that synaptopodin staining was
missing in focal lesions in patients undergoing SRL regimen
[37]. Since we only analyzed podocyte markers as a possible
source of glomerular proteinuria in this study it is of note that
mTOR inhibitors also can interfere with the expression of
proteins of the proximal tubule, resulting in decreased tubular
mediated albumin endocytosis [38].
Our findings regarding the actin cytoskeleton revealed higher
numbers of cells having a reorganized cytoskeleton in both
mTOR inhibitor groups. Since migration is functionally linked to
proteinuria and mechanistically linked to the actin cytoskeleton,
we were interested in the migrational behavior of podocytes
incubated with mTOR inhibitors. We found reduced migration in
the mTOR inhibitor groups compared to control, but no
differences of EVL and SRL in the parallel analysis.
In general, the function of immunosuppressant agents is to
reduce the immune system’s response. Therefore, it was not
surprising that incubation with both, EVL and SRL, lead to
reduced inflammatory response. Of note, inflammation was
even lower in the SRL group. Since lower levels of
inflammation are mostly advantageous, the impact of SRL on
podocytes should be less harmful than that of EVL due to lower
inflammation and potential reduced proteinuria.
Another aspect of mTOR inhibitors in transplant patients is
the problem of DGF, which particularly occurs after de novo
SRL therapy [10]. Although the literature is inconsistent at that
point, as some authors did not see any differences or even
improvement using mTOR inhibitors with regard to DGF [8,9] it
has been shown that in patients suffering from DGF, biopsy￾proven increased tubular and podocyte apoptosis was
demonstrated [39].
Due to the fact that we observed quite low inflammatory
levels, the question came up of what happens to the cells after
mTOR incubation. Do they become apoptotic? We performed a
TUNEL assay as well as immunofluorescence staining of
activated caspase-3 to determine this and found that apoptosis
increased in both mTOR inhibitor groups and was even more
elevated in the SRL group. Therefore, it can be concluded that
these cells did not survive using the inflammatory pathway;
instead, they went directly into apoptosis.
One possible result of apoptotic events in the glomerulus is
protein excretion. Proteinuria is the result of various renal
disorders in the absence or lack of synaptopodin [36]. The
decrease or absence of proteinuria when using CNI seems to
be due to the fact that CNI have a stabilizing effect on the actin
cytoskeleton of podocytes, which is essential for the integrity of
the glomerular filter [40]. When incubating podocytes with
mTOR inhibitors, we did not only find reduced synaptopodin
expression but also a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton;
this indicates potential risk to develop proteinuria in vivo, which
has already been shown for the switch from CNI to SRL
therapy [37].
The advantages and disadvantages of the different regimens
have to be considered in the hypothetical application of our
experimental data to the treatment of patients, as well as in
analyzing the clinical studies carried out so far. On the one
hand, CNI nephrotoxicity cannot be neglected; at the same
time, however, CNI not only stabilize the actin cytoskeleton but
also are more potent in the prevention of allograft rejection. On
the other hand, when using mTOR inhibitors, podocyte damage
resulting in proteinuria might occur. Currently, the mTOR
inhibitors EVL and SRL are available. The focus of this study
was a simultaneous analysis of the two. De novo SRL therapy
has been reported to result in proteinuria and in focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis at least to some degree. In these
cases, diminished synaptopodin expression was observed [37].
Although an analysis of the mTOR inhibitors EVL and SRL in
parallel in renal transplant therapy had not been done
previously, there was already some evidence that SRL may be
inferior to EVL with regard to toxicity in general. Rehm et al.
reported that SRL-induced pneumonitis in kidney transplant
patients was resolved after conversion to EVL [41]. In a recent
study by Carvalho et al., a switch was made from an SRL to
EVL regimen in renal transplant patients, but not vice versa in a
crossover design; they did not find any differences between the
drugs regarding e.g. serum creatinine or proteinuria [42]. In an
animal study the combination of low dose CsA with either EVL
or SRL with respect to nephrotoxicity was analyzed. The
authors proclaim a reduced CsA nephrotoxicity in the
combination of EVL with CsA [43].
Conclusion
Our in vitro data point to differences in podocyte damage for
EVL compared to SRL, in particular with regard to podocyte
proteins and apoptosis. However, the clinical significance,
especially with respect to the development of de novo
proteinuria or delayed graft function, still has to be investigated.
