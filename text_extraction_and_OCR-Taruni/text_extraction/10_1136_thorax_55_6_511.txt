The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to respiratory disease in
the immunocompromised host remains a challenge for several
reasons: (1) the current increase in both the number of
immunocompromised hosts and their length of survival; (2) the
high frequency of lung disease in these patients,1-3 and (3) the
severity of these lung diseases.3-5 A good example is given in a
recent review by Paterson et alof the epidemiology of invasive
aspergillosis in transplant recipients.5 The incidence of this
opportunistic infection, which mainly affects the lung, varies from
1% in kidney recipients to 9% in lung recipients (with 2% in liver
recipients and 7% in bone marrow recipients). In this population it
has a mortality rate of 55–92% and accounts for 10–15% of deaths
of all transplant recipients.
In fact, the diagnostic challenge is continuously evolving in the
immunocompromised host and the following three questions need
to be considered: (1) What new data are available on the diagnostic
and therapeutic approach? (2) What current changes are there in
the diagnostic and therapeutic approach in neutropenic patients?
(3) What current changes are there in the diagnostic and
therapeutic approach in the immunocompromised host without
neutropenia?
What new data are available on the
diagnostic and therapeutic approach?
IS THERE AN EVOLUTION IN THE TYPE AND


SEVERITY OF THE UNDERLYING
IMMUNODEFICIENCIES?
The data from the literature clearly show the continuous changes
both in the indications for immunosuppressive treatment and in the
nature and dosages of the immunosuppressive drugs used. For
example, steroids are increasingly used in patients with chronic
lung disease such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or sarcoidosis6; the use of combined
treatment for solid tumours—for example, chemotherapy and
thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer7 or intensive chemotherapy
combined with total body irradiation, transplantation of autologous
bone marrow, and 13-cis-retinoic acid for neuroblastoma8; and the
performance of solid organ transplantations for lung, liver, cardiac
or …
