Background: Overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased nitric oxide
generation may be associated with the hyperdynamic circulation of patients with cirrhosis. We have, for
the first time, used the highly selective iNOS inhibitor, 1400W, to determine whether iNOS activity
contributes to the regulation of vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
Methods: Bilateral forearm blood flow was measured using strain gauge plethysmography in eight
patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and eight matched healthy volunteers during intrabrachial infusion of
1400W (0.1–1 mmol/min), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, a non-selective NOS inhibitor; 2–
8 mmol), and norepinephrine (a control vasoconstrictor; 60–480 pmol/min).
Results: In patients with cirrhosis, 1400W, L-NMMA, and norepinephrine caused dose dependent
reductions in forearm blood flow: peak reductions of 11 (5)%, 37 (4)%, and 48 (5)%, respectively (p,0.05
for all). In contrast, 1400W had no effect on blood flow (+4 (8)%; NS) in healthy controls despite similar
reductions in blood flow with L-NMMA and norepinephrine (39 (5)% and 49 (5)%, respectively; p,0.05
for both).
Conclusions: We have, for the first time, demonstrated that 1400W causes peripheral vasoconstriction in
patients with cirrhosis but not healthy matched controls. This suggests that iNOS contributes to the
regulation of peripheral vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and may contribute towards
the hyperdynamic circulation associated with this condition.
P
atients with advanced liver disease have a hyperdynamic
circulation that is characterised by low arterial pressure,
high cardiac output, splanchnic vasodilatation, and low
systemic vascular resistance.1–3 This occurs despite activation
of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems, and increased activ￾ity of endogenous vasodilators, such as nitric oxide,4 has been
suggested as a possible cause. Plasma concentrations of nitric
oxide and its metabolites nitrite and nitrate are increased in
patients with cirrhosis and ascites.5 6 Exhaled breath of
patients contains higher nitric oxide concentrations than
normal subjects, and correlates with cardiac output and
Child-Pugh score.7 Moreover, systemic administration of a
non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor increases sys￾temic vascular resistance and blood pressure in patients with
cirrhosis.8
Nitric oxide is generated from L-arginine, a reaction
catalysed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Three isoforms of
NOS have been identified; endothelial, inducible, and
neuronal.9 Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is
expressed constitutively, and produces small amounts of
nitric oxide for short periods of time in response to exogenous
and endogenous stimuli. It is found in a number of cell types
but principally endothelial cells.10 In contrast, inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) is synthesised de novo in response to
inflammation and is found in vascular smooth muscle cells,
hepatocytes, macrophages, and many other cell types.9 Once
expressed, it produces large amounts of nitric oxide for
prolonged periods.9
In various pathological states, endotoxins, cytokines, and
bacterial infections have promoted iNOS formation and are
associated with overproduction of nitric oxide. This causes
hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and a hyperdynamic
circulation.1 2 Bacterial overgrowth and failure of the gut
mucosal barrier commonly promotes bacterial translocation
and endotoxaemia in patients with cirrhosis,11–13 and several
reports have demonstrated an association between nitric
oxide release and endotoxinaemia.5 14 15 Vallance and
Moncada hypothesised that, through such mechanisms,
iNOS formation may account for the hyperdynamic circula￾tion of patients with advanced liver disease.16
Until recently, it has not been possible to distinguish
clearly between endothelial and inducible NOS activity due to
the lack of specific inhibitors. N-(3-(aminomethyl) benzyl)
acetamidine (1400W) is a novel selective inhibitor of human
iNOS that has recently become available for clinical use.17 It
competes with L-arginine to bind irreversibly with iNOS and
is at least 5000-fold more selective for iNOS than eNOS,
making it one of the most selective iNOS inhibitor to date.17
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the
contribution of functional iNOS activity to peripheral
vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis and ascites by
determining the effect of direct local intra-arterial 1400W
on peripheral blood flow.
METHODS
Study population
Eight patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis, ascites, and
portal hypertension, and eight age and sex matched healthy
subjects were recruited. All patients were ambulant, had
endoscopically proven varices, and normal serum creatinine
(,100 mmol/l). In order to avoid alcohol induced depression
of vascular responses,18 patients were abstinent from alcohol
for at least one month, confirmed by history and repeated
blood ethanol testing. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis

were excluded due to the possible vasoactive effects of
hyperbilirubinaemia. Patients with clinically overt bacterial
infection, neutrophilia, or pyrexia (body temperature
.37.5˚C) were excluded from the study. To avoid the
possibility of altering the endogenous vasopressor systems,
all subjects were maintained on their normal sodium intake
(,150 mmol/day). None of the patients received vasoactive
(including beta adrenoreceptor blockers) or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs in the week before, and all patients
abstained from food, tobacco, and caffeine containing drinks
for at least four hours before each study. All female subjects
were postmenopausal both for safety and to avoid the
variability in vascular responses that may be associated with
cyclical hormonal changes.19 The studies were undertaken in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World
Medical Association, the approval of the local research ethics
committee, and the written informed consent of each subject.
Drugs and intra-arterial administration
The brachial artery of the non-dominant arm was cannulated
with a 27 standard wire gauge steel needle (Cooper’s Needle
Works Ltd, Birmingham, UK) under local anaesthesia. The
cannula was attached to a 16 gauge epidural catheter (Portex
Ltd, Hythe, Kent, UK) and patency was maintained by
infusion of saline (0.9%: Baxter Health Care Ltd, Thetford,
UK) via an IVAC P1000 syringe pump (IVAC Ltd,
Basingstoke, UK). The rate of intra-arterial infusions was
maintained constant throughout all studies at 1 ml/min.
Pharmaceutical grade 1400W (Merck Biosciences AG,
La¨ufelfingen, Switzerland), L-NMMA (Merck Biosciences
AG), and norepinephrine (Levophed, Sanofi-Winthrop Ltd,
Guildford, UK) were dissolved in saline on the day of the
study.
Haemodynamic measurements
Blood flow was measured in both forearms by venous
occlusion plethysmography, as described previously.20 Blood
pressure and heart rate were monitored in the non-infused
arm at intervals throughout each study with a semi
automated non-invasive oscillometric sphygmomanometer.
Study design
Subjects attended on a single occasion, at 9am, and were
recumbent throughout the study. Strain gauges and cuffs
were applied, and the brachial artery of the non-dominant
arm was cannulated. Forearm blood flow was measured
every 6–10 minutes. Following a 30 minute equilibration
period, during which saline was infused, subjects received
intra-arterial infusions of 1400W (iNOS inhibitor) at 0.1, 0.3,
and 1 mmol/min for 6–18 minutes at each dose, L-NMMA
(non-selective NOS inhibitor) at 2, 4, and 8 mmol/min for 6–
18 minutes at each dose,21 and norepinephrine (control
vasoconstrictor) at 60, 120, 240, and 480 pmol/min for six
minutes at each dose,22 23 with 30 minute saline washout
periods between each drug infusion (fig 1).
Data analysis and statistics
Plethysmographic data were extracted from chart data files,
and the last five linear recordings in each measurement
period were averaged. Forearm blood flows were calculated
from the plethysmographic data, as described previously.20

Data were examined, where appropriate, by ANOVA with
repeated measures and two tailed Student’s t test using
Microsoft Excel 2002. Data are expressed as mean (SEM).
Statistical significance was taken at the 5% level.
RESULTS
Patients with cirrhosis were well matched to control subjects
(table 1) although patients had a higher heart rate, in
keeping with their hyperdynamic circulation. Throughout
each study, there were no significant changes in mean
arterial pressure, heart rate, or forearm blood flow in the non￾infused arm. There was no significant difference in baseline
forearm blood flow in the infused arm between patients with
cirrhosis and control subjects (3.9 (0.7) and 3.9 (0.7) ml/
100 ml/min, respectively).
In patients with cirrhosis, intrabrachial infusion of 1400W,
L-NMMA, and norepinephrine caused dose dependent
reductions in infused forearm blood flow: peak reductions
of 11 (5)%, 37 (4)%, and 48 (5)%, respectively (p,0.05 for
all). In contrast, 1400W had no effect on blood flow (+4 (8)%;
NS) in healthy controls despite similar reductions in blood
flow with L-NMMA and norepinephrine (39 (5)% and 49
(5)% respectively; p,0.05 for both) (figs 2–4; table 2).
DISCUSSION
We have, for the first time, demonstrated that inhibition of
inducible NOS causes vasoconstriction in the forearm
circulation of patients with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver
disease. This finding suggests that inducible NOS may be
partly responsible for the overproduction of nitric oxide
associated with the hyperdynamic circulation of cirrhosis.
In 1991, Vallance and Moncada16 suggested that the chara￾cteristic hyperdynamic circulation of liver cirrhosis resulted
from increased production of nitric oxide secondary to
endotoxaemia induced expression of iNOS. Both animal24–27
and clinical28 studies have variably provided support for this
hypothesis, with significant tissue expression of iNOS in
cirrhosis. However, current opinion suggests that eNOS
rather than iNOS is the isoform responsible for the
circulatory dysfunction associated with cirrhosis.26 27 The
majority of the data supporting a role for eNOS comes from
rodent models without advanced liver disease. In a rodent
model of cirrhosis with advanced liver disease, clear
induction of iNOS was demonstrated in the splanchnic
vasculature.29 This suggests that differing isoforms of NOS
may play varying roles through the course of cirrhosis, with
eNOS the dominant isoform in early cirrhosis and iNOS the
dominant isoform in advanced cirrhosis. For the first time,
our data suggest that iNOS appears to be functionally active
and may contribute to the regulation of vascular tone in
patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
During our study and in previous work,21 23 30 infusion of
the non-selective NOS inhibitor, L-NMMA, produced a
similar vasoconstriction in healthy controls and patients
with cirrhosis. This suggests that if overall NOS activity is
similar, then the contribution from eNOS must be down￾regulated. Indeed, decreased eNOS expression and increased
iNOS expression occurs in other inflammatory conditions31–33
and is consistent with our findings in patients with cirrhosis.
The forearm circulation is generally representative of other
systemic vascular resistance beds.34 In the present clinical
study, we have not established the role of iNOS in the

splanchnic or portal circulations of patients with cirrhosis.
However, if the forearm circulation is a valid surrogate, then
selective iNOS inhibition would be expected to improve the
portal hypertension and systemic hypotension associated
with cirrhosis. We therefore believe that systemic studies are
needed to assess the role of iNOS inhibition in patients with
cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Study limitations
The present study is the first to use the iNOS inhibitor 1400W
in humans in vivo. 1400W is a monoamidine monoamine
analogue that competes with L-arginine to bind tightly and
irreversibly to iNOS. It is more than 5000-fold more potent
against purified human iNOS than eNOS and is one of the
most selective inhibitors of iNOS reported to date.17 The
selectivity of 1400W, both in vitro and in vivo, makes it an
attractive tool for assessing the contribution of iNOS.
However, an important concern is whether the dose of
1400W chosen is appropriate to achieve complete inhibition
of iNOS activity in vivo. 1400W inhibits rodent vascular iNOS
with an EC50 value of 0.8 mM, an eightfold higher potency
than L-NMMA which inhibits iNOS with an EC50 value of
6 mM.35 During infusion of 1400W at 1 mmol/min, with
calculated blood flow rates of approximately 20–25 ml/min,
we would predict effective end organ concentrations to be
between 40 and 50 mM—that is, more than 50-fold higher
than the EC50. We are therefore confident that we have
achieved complete and selective iNOS inhibition in our study.
During the study, forearm blood flow did not return to
baseline after infusion of 1400W in patients with cirrhosis.
This is not unexpected as 1400W is an irreversible inhibitor of
iNOS17 and why we designed the study with 1400W as the
first infusion.
Another potential limitation is that all patients had alcohol
induced liver disease and our findings may not be applicable
to other forms of liver cirrhosis. Excess alcohol intake is
known to alter the response to exogenous vasopressor agents,
such as norepinephrine.18 However, all our subjects were
abstinent from alcohol for a minimum of one month, as
determined by clinical history and random ethanol testing.
Moreover, consistent with previous work,22 23 we have
demonstrated a normal response to norepinephrine infusion,
suggesting no significant derangements in vascular smooth
muscle function.
In conclusion, we have, for the first time, demonstrated
that 1400W causes peripheral vasoconstriction in patients
with cirrhosis but not in healthy matched controls. This
suggests that iNOS contributes to the regulation of peripheral
vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and may
contribute towards the hyperdynamic circulation associated
with this condition. Further studies are required to look at
the role of iNOS in differing stages of cirrhosis and in patients
with advanced cirrhosis undergoing bacterial decontamina￾tion.

Answer
From question on page 541
Computed tomography (CT) scan showed invagination of
a segment of thickened terminal ileum into the ascending
colon at the level of the hepatic flexure. The leading point of
the intussusceptum revealed marked mucosal irregularity
and created a convex margin as it met air in the distended
ascending colon. Laparotomy was performed and revealed
an 8 cm bowel mass with telescoping of the terminal ileum
to the ascending colon. Right hemicolectomy without
reduction of intussusception and primary anastomosis was
performed. The operative specimen demonstrated the lead￾ing point of the intussusception as a circumferential
ulcerative caecal tumour (fig 2). The patient recovered well
and was discharged eight days after operation. Pathology
revealed Dukes’ C moderately differentiated adenocarci￾noma.
Enteric intussusception is an uncommon condition in
adults. It represents 1% of patients with bowel obstructions.
In contrast with intussusception in children, a demonstrable
aetiology is found in 70–90% of cases, of which at least half
are due to malignancy. The lesion disturbs peristalsis of the
bowel and causes telescoping of the proximal segment into
the distal bowel lumen. Unlike the acute presentation in
children, adult intussusception may present with acute,
intermittent, or chronic symptoms. Abdominal pain is the
most common presentation. CT usually shows the intussus￾ception complex well. Other investigations may include
ultrasound, contrast study, or colonoscopy. Treatment
requires resection of the involved segment of bowel with its
draining lymphatic due to the high likelihood of an under￾lying malignancy. Reduction should be avoided as the bowel
wall involved is usually oedematous and friable.
