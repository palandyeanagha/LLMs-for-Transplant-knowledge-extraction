Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide.
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are probably at higher risk of severe infection and associated
complications from COVID-19. Data on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection in SOT recipients are
limited. Using the TriNetX database, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from January 20, 2020,
to July 7, 2020, were included in the study. We compared clinical outcomes comprising hospitalization, need
for critical care services, intubation, and mortality among SOT recipients and patients without SOT. Of
30,573 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 288 had SOT. Patients with SOT were more likely to be
hospitalized (37.2% vs. 12.2%; p < 0.0001), needed critical care services (6.9% vs. 2.3%; p < 0.0001), needed
intubation (7.9% vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), and had a higher 30-day mortality (11.1% vs. 3.8%; p < 0.0001).
Patients in the transplant group were older (55.4 vs. 47.6 years; p < 0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of
medical co-morbidities. SOT recipients are at significant risk of adverse COVID-19 related outcomes,
including hospitalization, need for critical care services, and 30-day mortality, likely due to multiple co￾morbid conditions.

Introduction
The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has implied a
tremendous health hazard on the world population. So far, approximately 13 million people are infected
with COVID-19, leading to 565,000 reported deaths and we continue to face significant challenges [1].
COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has not only
posed tremendous mortality and morbidity risk but also impacted financial, social, and emotional aspects of
human well-being [1]. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients presumably are at high risk for COVID-19
infection, especially elderly SOT recipients aged > 60 years [2,3]. Low threshold for testing COVID-19
infection in transplant population is probably beneficial as they manifest atypical symptoms, predominantly
diarrhea [4]. The spectrum of clinical disease varies from asymptomatic viral infection to life-threatening
illness necessitating mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapies [2,5]. COVID-19 infection is
associated with elevated levels of cytokines, particularly IL-6 (interleukin-6), from an exaggerated host
immune response [6,7]. In determining the course of disease, cellular immunity plays a notable role, placing
SOT recipients at potential risk of severe complications from COVID-19 infections [8].
Earlier reports suggested similar clinical courses and favorable outcomes in SOT recipients compared with
non-SOT population, likely secondary to attenuated immune and cytokine responses [9-11]. Heterogeneous
clinical course among SOT cohort, with potential of rapid progression to complicated and fatal clinical
course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, has also been reported [12]. Recent studies have reported
severe clinical course and worse outcomes while on immunosuppression, with associated co-morbidities
[4,13-14]. Given the disparities in existing data, we conducted this study to compare the outcomes among
SOT recipients and non-SOT population with COVID -19 infection.
Materials And Methods
TriNetX, a world health collaborative clinical research database that facilitates collecting real-time
electronic medical record data from the network of health care organizations across the United States and
internationally, was used for extracting information about de-identified COVID -19 patients with and
without SOT. “COVID-19 Research Network” in TriNetX represents an extremely large, worldwide COVID￾19 database.
While the TriNetX database does not acknowledge data downloads or individual patient information for
review, it authorizes analysis in the form of queries. Queries made through the TriNetX database operate
through browser and real-time features. Several studies on COVID -19 were published to date using the

Study protocol
Study protocol was implemented after appropriate approval was obtained from the Institutional Review
Board. The analysis was conducted on July 7, 2020, on the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network. We
identified SOT patients using the following ICD-10 (the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
Revision) codes: kidney transplant (Z94.0), heart transplant (Z94.1), lung transplant (Z94.2), and liver
transplant (Z94.4) [21]. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 on or after January 20, 2020, to July 7,
2020, were identified using the LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) code (9088: SARS
coronavirus 2 and related RNA positive). Thereafter, baseline demographics, co-morbidities, and clinical
outcomes, including hospitalization, intubation, need for critical care services, and mortality within 30 days
from diagnosis of COVID-19, were compared in patients with and without SOT. TriNetX analytics function
was utilized in performing statistical analysis. Outcomes were analyzed using Z-test, propensity score
matching (demographics and co-morbidities) was conducted using a t-test. Descriptive statistics were
reported as number of observations and percentage or as mean ± standard deviation, as applicable. Two
physicians (K. N. and S. O.) independently performed these queries.
Results
A total of 288 SOT patients were identified using the TriNetX database, with laboratory-confirmed COVID￾19 between January 20, 2020, and July 7, 2020. Among them, 109 (37.8%) patients were females, 89 (30.9%)
patients were Caucasians, 83 (28.8%) African-Americans, 37 (12.8%) were Hispanic, and 79 (27.4%) were of
other races/ethnicities/unknown. There were 30,285 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients without SOT
in the database. Baseline characteristics such as race, gender, and co-morbidities in the transplant versus
non-transplant groups are detailed in Table 1.

Among the two groups, patients with transplant were older (55.4 vs. 47.6 years; p < 0.0001) and had a
significantly higher prevalence of co-morbidities including diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease,
hypertension, smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart

Discussion
Current literature on SOT recipients with COVID infection is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Our study is
unique and one of the largest reported thus far, and includes 288 SOT recipients with COVID infection
compared with 30,285 COVID positive non-SOT population. While some early small case series reported
favorable outcomes among SOT recipients during their initial clinical course [12,22], large studies with
longer follow-ups reported greater adverse events [14,23]. In the study by Pereira et al. [14], which included
90 SOT recipients with COVID-19 infection in New York City during a three-week period, 76% of patients
were hospitalized and 34% required ICU, with 18% overall mortality (52% ICU mortality). A recent
international study among COVID infected kidney transplant recipients, with a 52-day mean follow-up,
reported 32% mortality among hospitalized patients and 52% mortality among patients in ICU, with a
median time to death of 15 days [23]. As discussed in the Results section, our study reaffirms that COVID
like any other infection causes adverse outcomes in SOT recipients and that the earlier thoughts of
attenuated immune response potentially offering protection from cytokine storm is probably not true. Our
results, similar to recently published reports by Fernández-Ruiz et al. [4] and Akalin et al. [13], emphasize
that associated co-morbidities of SOT recipients probably contribute to increased vulnerability, as well as
unpredictable and fatal clinical course.
There are some intrinsic limitations to our study, and some of them are inherent to large databases. First,
2020 Ranabothu et al. Cureus 12(11): e11344. DOI 10.7759/cureus.11344 4 of 6

this was a retrospective study and the data were obtained based on ICD 10-coding, which could be subjected
to reporting bias. Second, it remains unclear whether adverse outcomes are secondary to severe COVID
infection versus an effect of organ dysfunction among transplant patients. Third, subgroup analysis and
outcomes among patients with heart, liver, and lung transplant could not be provided given the very limited
data to make any analysis. Last, participants could have false-positive results on how COVID-19 is tested,
and such limitations exist in the majority of reports on COVID-19 during an ongoing pandemic.
Conclusions
Our study depicted worse outcomes with an increased need for hospitalization among COVID-19 infected
SOT recipients when compared with COVID-19 infected non-SOT population likely due to the prevalence of
multiple co-morbid conditions in SOT recipients, suggesting that SOT recipients should receive utmost care
to help prevent this dreadful infection and early referral to transplant centers with a higher level of care.
Spreading awareness and education regarding preventive measures against COVID-19 infection are crucial
in providing protection to these immunologically challenged populations. Implementing telehealth might
help to curb some exposure risk.
