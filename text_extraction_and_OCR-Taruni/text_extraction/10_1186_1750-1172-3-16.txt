Abstract
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that manifests as pulmonary
emphysema, liver cirrhosis and, rarely, as the skin disease panniculitis, and is characterized by low
serum levels of AAT, the main protease inhibitor (PI) in human serum. The prevalence in Western
Europe and in the USA is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,500 and 1 : 5,000 newborns, and is
highly dependent on the Scandinavian descent within the population. The most common deficiency
alleles in North Europe are PI Z and PI S, and the majority of individuals with severe AATD are PI
type ZZ. The clinical manifestations may widely vary between patients, ranging from asymptomatic
in some to fatal liver or lung disease in others. Type ZZ and SZ AATD are risk factors for the
development of respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, coughing), early onset emphysema, and airflow
obstruction early in adult life. Environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, and dust exposure
are additional risk factors and have been linked to an accelerated progression of this condition.
Type ZZ AATD may also lead to the development of acute or chronic liver disease in childhood
or adulthood: prolonged jaundice after birth with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal liver
enzymes are characteristic clinical signs. Cirrhotic liver failure may occur around age 50. In very
rare cases, necrotizing panniculitis and secondary vasculitis may occur. AATD is caused by
mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding AAT, and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
The diagnosis can be established by detection of low serum levels of AAT and isoelectric focusing.
Differential diagnoses should exclude bleeding disorders or jaundice, viral infection,
hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis. For treatment of lung disease,
intravenous alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy, annual flu vaccination and a pneumococcal
vaccine every 5 years are recommended. Relief of breathlessness may be obtained with long-acting
bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. The end-stage liver and lung disease can be treated by
organ transplantation. In AATD patients with cirrhosis, prognosis is generally grave.

Background
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency was first reported in 1963
by Carl-Bertil Laurell and Sten Eriksson who noted a link
between low plasma serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin
and symptoms of pulmonary emphysema [1]. Since these
first cases were described, an understanding of the bio￾chemical mechanisms and genetic abnormalities involved
has developed [2], and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is
now thought to be one of the most common hereditary
disorders worldwide, comparable in frequency to cystic
fibrosis [3,4].
The protein alpha-1-antitrypsin is a 52 kDa molecule pro￾duced primarily in hepatocytes and released into the
blood circulation by the liver [5]. The protein is present in
all body tissues but appears to have its primary physio￾logic significance in the lungs, where it protects the
healthy but fragile alveolar tissue from proteolytic damage
by enzymes like neutrophil elastase [6]. Alpha-1-antit￾rypsin is an acute phase protein which means that produc￾tion by the liver is subject to various stimuli, including
inflammatory mediators induced by fever [2]. Therefore,
protein levels in the circulation may vary depending on
the medical condition of an individual. The normal serum
concentration may range between 1.5 to 3.5 g/L (or 20 to
48 μM) [2]. Among clinicians and patients some confu￾sion may arise about the clinical significance of deficiency
in alpha-1-antitrypsin. The first cases described by Laurell
and Eriksson were related to a very low serum concentra￾tion of the protein and subsequently it was discovered
that these patients had a particular gene defect (defined as
Z deficiency) in both alleles of the chromosome making
them prone to the development of lung and liver disease.
Later in time it was discovered that various other gene
defects exist and most of them cause their own range of
serum concentrations below the normal range [5]. A
serum concentration below 0.5 g/L (11 μM) is considered
a reason for further analysis. In addition, individuals who
carry a genetic defect in only one allele of the chromo￾some (heterozygotes) may also have a reduced serum con￾centration (summary in Figure 1). Often, when patients
with emphysema are told that they are deficient of alpha￾1-antitrypsin, they fear that their deficiency will cause the
clinical events described by Laurell and Eriksson. How￾ever, as described below, it will be explained why in con￾trast to heterozygous MZ type, in most cases only the
homozygous Z type of deficiency, as well as some very rare
Null phenotypes with absent alpha-1-antitrypsin serum
levels result in clinical significant disease.
Epidemiology
The low frequency of the Pi ZZ phenotype in the general
normal population makes firm data collection with
respect to prevalence of affected individuals difficult to
obtain. The prevalence of AAT deficiency in newborns has
been estimated from large population studies, with a
screening of all newborns in Sweden in 1972 to 1974
being most comprehensive [7]. Of 200,000 children in
that study, 127 had the PiZZ phenotype, yielding a preva￾lence rate of approximately 1 in 1,600 newborns. Studies
from various regions of Europe have shown a large varia￾tion in frequency of the Z gene in different countries [8].
The gene frequency is highest on the northwestern sea￾board of the European continent and the mutation seems

in patients (right part of the figure). Each Pi type gives a characteristic set of bands from top to bottom on a polyacramide gel 
and is reported as Pi phenotype. These Pi types correlate to mean general serum AAT concentrations, but are dependent on 
the inflammatory status of the individual, as AAT is an acute-phase reactant protein. Clinical significant liver disease only occurs 
with Pi ZZ, clinical significant lung disease is associated with Pi Null, Pi SZ and PiZZ types.

likely to have arisen in southern Scandinavia. In the USA,
therefore, Z gene frequencies are highest in individuals of
northern of western European descent [9]. Over all, the
prevalence in the general population in Western Europe is
approximately 1 in 2,500. The distribution of the S gene is
quite different: the gene frequency is highest in the Iberian
Peninsula and the mutation is likely to have arisen in that
region [8].
Clinical description
The clinical manifestations of AAT deficiency are strongly
associated with the ZZ type of deficiency, but vary widely
between patients with ZZ type may, ranging from asymp￾tomatic in some to fatal liver or lung disease in others
[10]. In rare cases, necrotizing panniculitis and secondary
vasculitis may occur, but the latter observation is pre￾sented in only one study and has not been reproduced in
a second larger cohort.
Liver disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
Neonatal hepatic syndrome is a condition that occurs in a
small percentage of newborns with homozygous Z geno￾type alpha-1-antitrypsin [7] (Figure 2). Prolonged jaun￾dice after birth with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and
abnormal liver enzymes are characteristic clinical signs of
the genotype. Bleeding problems may result from liver
failure. This syndrome is believed to be an acute response
to polymerization of the Z-type protein within hepato￾cytes [11,12].
The consequences of chronic polymerization of Z-type
alpha-1-antitrypsin are hepatocyte damage and via fibro￾sis, a cirrhotic response [13]. This may occur clinically at
childhood or more frequently at age above 50 [14]. The
cirrhotic condition can be reversed by a liver transplant of
a donor with M-type genotype alpha-1-antitrypsin [15]. In
addition to cirrhotic disorder, a relatively high prevalence
of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carci￾noma has been reported [16].
The Z-allele is the most important geneti Figure 2 c defect in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
The Z-allele is the most important genetic defect in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. It is a single mutation in exon 5 of the gene, 
leading to substitution of the amino acid glutamine (G) in position 342 in the protein for a lysine (A) amino acid. Alpha-1-antit￾rypsin is an important protease inhibitor, in particular of neutrophil elastase. The Z allele results in hepatic polymerization in 
both hepatocyte inclusions and decreased serum concentration. Therefore, strategies to augment the inherited deficiency as 
well as the development of small peptides that can selectively inhibit polymerization of the Z allele of the AAT protein in the
liver are central to therapeutic approach.

Lung disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
The lung manifestations of AAT deficiency include
emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) [10]. Emphysema usually develops by the third
to fourth decade in affected individuals who smoke ciga￾rettes and may appear in the fifth or sixth decade in indi￾viduals who have never smoked.
It is currently hypothesized that two mechanisms contrib￾ute to the development of lung disease, in particular to
emphysema (Figure 2). First, the serum level of alpha-1-
antitrypsin appears to be important. It is observed that cig￾arette smokers who produce no alpha-1-antitrypsin at all
in their liver or in monocytes, defined as individuals with
the very rare homozygous Null variant, develop emphy￾sema at younger age than subjects with the homozygous
Z allele related deficiency [17]. Under appropriate circum￾stances, cigarette smoke recruits inflammatory cells in the
lung which may release proteolytic enzymes in alveolar
areas. For the development of emphysema, plasma levels
of alpha-1-antitrypsin are important in the protection
against proteolytic damage of alveoli in the lung, in par￾ticular by neutrophil elastase activity [18,19] (Figure 2).
An issue further supported by the observation that indi￾viduals with SZ and SS genotype (although significantly
less clinical information is available about SS type
patients), who on average have higher levels of alpha-1-
antitrypsin than the Null and Z genotype, are less prone to
the development of emphysema [20].
Second, the Z mutant of alpha-1-antitrypsin has a point
mutation Glu342Lys in the molecule that renders it prone
to polymerization of the protein (polymers) [12] (Figure
2). These polymers co-localize with neutrophils in the
alveoli of individuals with Z alpha-1-antitrypsin-related
emphysema and animal experiments demonstrated that
polymers cause an influx of neutrophils when instilled
into murine lungs [21]. Such polymers exert their effect
directly on neutrophils rather than via inflammatory
cytokines. The transition of native Z alpha-1-antitrypsin
to polymers inactivates its anti-proteinase function, and
also converts it to a proinflammatory stimulus, further
contributing to accelerated enzymatic alveolar tissue
destruction.
Textbooks on pulmonary medicine all teach us that ciga￾rette smokers with the Z genotype around age 40 acquire
panlobular emphysema in the lower lung lobes (Figure 3)
with high probability. Yet, the importance of registries
with phenotypical information about individuals with
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency was recently illustrated
[22]. The Alpha1 International Registry (AIR) database
contains patients over age 40 with a smoking history of
more than 10 packyears and Z genotype who have a com￾pletely normal lung function, including normal forced
expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and normal
gas transfer [22]. This suggests that protective factors may
exist, an issue that is currently under intense investigation.
It is difficult to prove that other lung diseases, such as
bronchiectasis (Figure 4), chronic bronchitis and asthma
are associated with the homozygous Z genotype. This
requires population based studies and these have not
been conducted.

Skin disorders and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
It is generally assumed that the skin disorder panniculitis
is associated with the Z genotype of alpha-1-antitrypsin
[23]. Panniculitis manifests as spontaneous necrotic areas
of the skin and spontaneous suppuration without previ￾ous trauma to the skin. It may occur anywhere in the
body, but there is a preference to the gluteal areas, trunk,
limbs and arms. Histologically, septae and fatty lobules
are extensively altered by inflammation with lymphohis￾tiocytic infiltration. Secondary vasculitis may results into
necrosis which is eliminated transepidermally.
Etiology
Molecular biology of alpha-1-antitrypsin
The gene encoding alpha-1-antitrypsin is found on chro￾mosome 14 at q31-32.3 and is called the SERPINA1 gene
[24]. The gene comprises four coding exons and three
additional exons. Hepatocytes and monocytes have pro￾motors and they are distinct and work via different mech￾anisms. Promoters regulate basal expression in the steady
state, while elements in the DNA known as enhancers
modulate expression during inflammation [25]. Several
sites of local transcriptional control have been identified
upstream of the hepatocyte transcription initiation site,
including binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α
(HNF-1α) and HNF-4. Humoral regulation is mediated
by cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncos￾tatin-M [26]. These cytokines work via a 3' enhancer
downstream of the hepatocyte promoter, and both oncos￾tatin-M and IL-6 work via different response elements.
Therefore, there are discrete binding sites providing dis￾tinct pathways for regulating the acute phase response via
different cytokines [24].
Alpha-1-antitrypsin is also produced by monocytes and
lung epithelial cells, and therefore there is also production
present in the lung [5]. The promoter for the AAT gene in
monocytes and other cell types is regulated by a different
group of transcription factors known as the Sp1 family
[27]. Here it has been suggested that RNA stability also
influences expression, as some transcripts may be more
stable than others. In the liver, there is only one transcript
of AAT; however, in other cell types, there are a number of
alternative transcripts. Although most serum AAT is man￾ufactured in the liver, monocytes and lung tissue have the
ability to make AAT; with appropriate stimuli, expression
can be increased substantially [25]. Recently, McNab et al.
showed that the defective gene in human monocytes of
type Z alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient individuals can be
corrected by transfection of small DNA fragments of M
type alpha-1-antitrypsin to result in increased secretion of
the protein [28]. The development of this method to
repair ex vivo the gene defect in isolated human mono￾cytes should have beneficial effects when these cells are re￾infused in the circulation and retained in the lung to give
protection against proteolytic alveolar damage. This
experiment remains to be conducted.
Many hereditary variants of the SERPINA1 gene are
known [29]. Because both alleles (paternal and maternal)
can be detected, the hereditary mode is called codomi￾nant. The most common and clinically most important
alleles leading to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are the Z
and S allele [24,30]. The frequency of the Z allele is high￾est in Scandinavian countries [6,29]; the frequency of the
S allele is highest in Spain and Portugal [7,31].
Protein characteristics of alpha-1-antitrypsin
The alpha-1-antitrypsin molecule includes 394 amino
acids and 3 glycosylated side chains coupled to asparagine
[32]. The molecule has a globular tertiary structure, and its
active site to inhibit enzymes is on a surface protrusion
(Figure 5). Here is where the most important amino acid
is present, a methionine in position 358, an aminoacid
susceptible to conversion to methionine sulfoxide by oxi￾dants from cigarette smoke, rendering it much less potent
as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase [33].
The Z-allele is a single mutation in exon 5, leading to sub￾stitution of the amino acid glutamine in position 342 in
the protein for a lysine amino acid [11]. The S-allele is a
single amino acid mutation in position 264 in the protein
where a glutamine is replaced by a valine amino acid [30].
What are the consequences of the S and Z allele? The
homozygous S variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin results in an
instable protein that is easily degraded outside the hepa￾tocyte and affects the half-life of the S variant [30]. The
homozygous Z variant has the property to form polymers
to aggregate within hepatocytes and therefore this type of
protein can only be secreted by hepatocytes in very low
quantities [12] (Figure 2 and 6). Likewise, Z-type alpha-1-
antitrypsin from monocytes also polymerize within these
cells and can only be secreted at very low levels.
Diagnosis and diagnostic methods
Who should be tested how for alpha-1-antitrypsin 
deficiency?
First of all, all newborns with a bleeding disorder or pro￾longed neonatal jaundice should be tested [10]. Secondly,
all individuals with a history of asthma or chronic
obstructive lung disease, particularly below the age of 40
[10]. Thirdly, all siblings of index cases [10]. Finally, all
individuals with unexpected liver cirrhosis should be
tested [2]. The aim of testing is to counsel individuals
affected by the Z genotype. With respect to liver disease,
patients should stop drinking alcohol and can be coun￾seled about future liver transplant. With respect to lung
disease, individuals should not start cigarette smoking or
should stop urgently when smoking already started. This

is the only available effective treatment to reduce the pro￾gression of decline in lung function. There is consensus in
the scientific community on how to test, expressed in an
ATS/ERS Statement on the diagnosis and treatment of
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency [10]. This important docu￾ment states that a physician should start with the detec￾tion of a serum level of alpha-1-antitrypsin (Figure 7). If
reduced below the reference value of the laboratory, phy￾sicians should obtain a genotype or phenotype of alpha￾1-antitrypsin. There are now commercial kits that test for
presence of Z and S alleles in the gene [34]. If the serum
level of alpha-1-antitrypsin is low, but the genotype test
does not reveal a Z or S deficiency, isoelectric focusing of
serum may reveal rare Null variants of alpha-1-antitrypsin
which can be further characterized by genotyping (Figure
1).
Once new cases of alpha-1-antitrypsin have been detected,
it is recommended by the Alpha1 International Registry
(AIR) [35] to contact the national representative for
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency matters to submit the clin￾ical phenotype of the patient to the database of AIR and to
obtain a plasma sample and DNA sample for future scien￾tific studies and potential participation of the newly
detected patient in future clinical trials for new drugs.
Differential diagnosis
Often physicians diagnose patients with emphysema at
age 30 to 40 but who have no alpha-1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency. There are no known other genetic deficiencies that
are as strongly related with emphysema as Pi ZZ alpha-1-
antitrypsin deficiency. Pediatricians who see newborns
with bleeding disorders or jaundice have a wider differen￾tial diagnosis. These include viral infection, hemochroma￾tosis, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis. Rarely,
liver biopsy is needed when Pi ZZ AATD is considered,
because the latter can be easily determined by serum
examination in the phenotyping laboratory.
Genetic counseling and prenatal testing
When patients are identified as a new case of homozygous
type Z alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, the issue of herita￾bility for their children is frequently raised. It is less incon￾venient for the children when first the other parent is
investigated by isoelectric focusing or genotyping for
alpha-1-antitrypsin. Since about 95% of individuals carry
the MM phenotype, all children from parents with ZZ and
MM type will carry the MZ type alpha-1-antitrypsin. If the
parent is not MM, but is carrying a deficient allele next to
the M allele (i.e. MZ), there is a 50% chance of ZZ geno￾type for every newborn from these parents and this can be
confirmed in the child by isoelectic focusing of serum.
Prenatal testing is not a routine procedure due to the low
penetration of liver disease shortly after birth.
Treatment
At present, treatment options for alpha-1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency are very limited. There are no randomized, pla￾cebo-controlled studies that provide proof of an effective
cure [10]. Only end-stage liver and lung disease can be
treated by organ transplantation [10]. However, with the
introduction of lung densitometry as a new outcome
parameter for the evaluation of new drugs in lung disease,
there are now, for the first time in 20 years, ongoing stud￾ies to investigate potentially efficacious new drugs in
properly designed trials. We have to await the results of
these trials before we can treat our patients effectively.
For treatment of lung disease, the ATS/ERS Statement rec￾ommends intravenous alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation
therapy for Pi ZZ individuals with FEV1 between 35 and
65% of predicted [10]. In addition, the World Health

genetyping is warranted. Very low serum levels or levels below the detection limit of the serum assay suggest the presence of 
a Null variant (no production by the hepatocytes, and therefore distinct from the Z deficiency). A Null variant may be further 
analysed by isoelectric focussing and/or gene sequencing (as described in Fregonese et al., Respir Med; in press).

Organization (WHO) recommends annual flu vaccina￾tion and a pneumococcal vaccine every 5 years [3]. Like in
emphysema patients without alpha-1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency, relief of breathlessness may be obtained with long￾acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids [36].
Patients with liver cirrhosis should be monitored for liver
failure just like any form of liver cirrhosis and should be
evaluated for liver transplant when they turn into clinical
end-stage liver failure. Since the polymerization of Pi ZZ
alpha-1-antitrypsin is accelerated by fever, patients may
use paracetamol or other anti-inflammatory drugs to
reduce fever.
Natural history and prognosis
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency with its many genotypes
and its manifestation in various organs is rarely observed
in daily clinical practice and is frequently not diagnosed
or misdiagnosed. On average, the delay from the first
signs of disease to the correct diagnosis is several years
[37]. Once diagnosed correctly, the prognosis of both liver
and lung disease is rather variable either. Several studies
have shown that FEV1 is the most important predictor of
survival of patients with emphysema due to alpha-1-anti￾trypsin deficiency (AATD). For individuals with an FEV1
below 20% of predicted, the 2 year mortality is 40% if not
treated by a lung transplant [38]. Patients who have never
smoked and who are detected by screening of affected
family members turn out to have a normal life expectancy.
Most of these AATD individuals (83%) are clinically
healthy throughout adulthood and most will have liver
enzyme abnormalities in early life [39]. All of these obser￾vations were performed more than 15 years ago and in the
mean time computed tomography of the chest provided
new analytical information on the quality of lung paren￾chyma, including the extent of emphysema. Dawkins et al.
reported that lung density values assessed by computed
tomography have better associations with mortality in
type Z alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency than FEV1 [40].
In adults, cirrhosis in AATD patients may become clini￾cally apparent at any age, but the peak incidence is to be
expected in the elderly age. Prognosis is generally grave,
with a mean survival of 2 years after diagnosis of cirrhosis
is established and is a clear indication for liver transplant
[41].
