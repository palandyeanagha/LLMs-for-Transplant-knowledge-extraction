Abstract
Background: The PGC-1α/PPAR axis has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for several metabolic
disorders. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the pan-PPAR agonist, bezafibrate, in tafazzin knockdown mice
(TazKD), a mouse model of Barth syndrome that exhibits age-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy with left
ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
Results: The effect of bezafibrate on cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography in TazKD mice with
or without beta-adrenergic stress. Adrenergic stress by chronic isoproterenol infusion exacerbates the cardiac
phenotype in TazKD mice, significantly depressing LV systolic function by 4.5 months of age. Bezafibrate intake over
2 months substantially ameliorates the development of LV systolic dysfunction in isoproterenol-stressed TazKD mice.
Without beta-adrenergic stress, TazKD mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy by 7 months of age. Prolonged treatment
with suprapharmacological dose of bezafibrate (0.5% in rodent diet) over a 4-month period effectively prevented
LV dilation in mice isoproterenol treatment. Bezafibrate increased mitochondrial biogenesis, however also promoted
oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, improvement of systolic function in bezafibrate-treated mice
was accompanied with simultaneous reduction of cardiolipin content and increase of monolysocardiolipin
levels in cardiac muscle.
Conclusions: Thus, we demonstrate that bezafibrate has a potent therapeutic effect on preventing cardiac
dysfunction in a mouse model of Barth syndrome with obvious implications for treating the human disease.
Additional studies are needed to assess the potential benefits of PPAR agonists in humans with Barth syndrome.

Background
Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disorder that
affects multiple organs. The mutated gene causing BTHS
is (TAZ), which encodes a mitochondrial transacylase
tafazzin, a key enzyme in the cardiolipin (CL) remodel￾ing pathway. Mutations in the TAZ result in CL defi￾ciency, and increase the monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) to
cardiolipin ratio (MLCL/CL) accompanied by structural
and functional defects in mitochondria of affected
individuals and Taz knockdown (TazKD) mice [1, 2].
This mitochondrial CL deficiency destabilizes the integ￾rity and activity of electron transfer chain (ETC.) com￾plexes [3–5]. The human phenotype includes dilated
cardiomyopathy, underdeveloped skeletal musculature,
and intermittent neutropenia [6]. Inactivation of Taz
with doxycycline-inducible (tet-on) shRNA-mediated
gene silencing in mice results in the LV dilation and
systolic dysfunction after 6 months of age [1, 7]. In
addition, previous studies also reported the embryonic
lethality in TazKD mice when knockdown was initiated
with doxycycline at high dose [8].

Current therapies for BTHS are limited and have vari￾able efficacy. These include antioxidants, a diet supple￾mented with specific amino acids, and granulocyte
colony stimulating factor (GCSF) to treat neutropenia.
Patients with BTHS may develop progressive heart fail￾ure and require mechanical circulatory support and car￾diac transplantation [9]. An acute decline in health from
a stable status to a life-threatening crisis can occur with
little warning so that patients and their families live in a
constant state of anxiety. Developing effective therapies
for BTHS continues to be a challenge, especially because
of the limited number of patients, extraordinary pheno￾typic variability, and unpredictable clinical course [9–11].
Energy limitation plays a major role in heart failure
[12]. The replenishment of energy supply in cardiac cells
by metabolic therapy is an expanding opportunity in the
treatment of heart failure. Due to a central role in energy
metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics, peroxi￾some proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) may be
potential therapeutic targets for metabolic targeted ther￾apy to ameliorate cardiac dysfunction induced by Taz
deficiency. Indeed, beneficial effects of activation of the
PPAR/PGC1α axis have been demonstrated in various
mitochondrial disorders. Pharmacological activation of
PPARα facilitates post-ischemic functional recovery in
hypertrophied neonatal rabbit hearts [13] and slows
down the progression of the left ventricular dysfunction
in the porcine model of tachycardia-induced cardio￾myopathy [14]. In patients with metabolic syndrome,
BF reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and
lowers cardiac mortality risk [15]. Treatment with BF
provided beneficial effects in patients with carnitine
palmitoyltransferase-II (CPT-II) deficiency [16], although
other studies reported conflicting results [17, 18]. Here,
we report the results of experimental treatment with BF in
a mouse model of BTHS, with an shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Taz expression (TazKD) that exhibits age￾dependent cardiomyopathy [1, 7].
Methods
Animals
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center. Animals were housed in micro￾isolator cages at 25o C under a 14/10 h light/dark cycle
with free access to drinking water and food. Doxycycline￾inducible shRNA-mediated TazKD mice have been
described previously [1, 4, 7]. Taz knockdown was induced
prior to conception by feeding females doxycycline￾containing rodent chow (625 mg/kg) 3 days before mat￾ing. This approach allows 85–95% silencing of Taz in
heart and skeletal muscle [1]. In the ensuing offspring,
after 3 months of age, the doxycycline administration
route was switched to drinking water (0.1% doxycycline,
10% sugar). Both WT and TazKD mice were continuously
maintained on doxycycline-containing water for the dur￾ation of the study. Male mice with C57BL/6 background
were used in experiments.
Micro-osmotic pumps (Alzet model 1002) were used to
deliver controlled amounts (0.25 μL/h) of isoproterenol
(Iso), a β-adrenergic agonist, to mice for 14 days. Pumps
were loaded with a dose of Iso consistent with 30 mg/kg/
day. All aseptic procedures were performed in a rodent
surgical suite. Mice were anesthetized with 1.75% iso￾flurane. A small incision of approximately 3–5 mm was
made at the nape of the neck. The pump was inserted
and CV-22 biodegradable suture was used to close the
wound. Then the mice were returned to their original
cages for recovery.
At 3 months of age, mice were given specifically for￾mulated pelleted rodent chow that contained either no
or 0.5% bezafibrate (TestDiet, St. Louis, MO) provided
at libitum for 2 or 4 months. At the same time, the
doxycycline administration route was changed for all
animals from rodent chow to drinking water with 0.1%
of doxycycline and 10% sucrose since manufacturing and
sterilizing the rodent chow that contained both bezafi￾brate and doxycycline was technically difficult.
Echocardiography
Two-dimensional and M-mode transthoracic echocardi￾ography were performed under isoflurane anesthesia as
previously described using a Vevo 2100 Micro-Imaging
system (VisualSonics, Inc.) and a 40 MHz transducer
[1]. Off-line analyses were performed by investigators
blinded to genotype.
Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR- based assay was used to determine
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers relative to
the diploid chromosomal DNA content. Fragment of
mtDNA was amplified using ACTATCCCCTTCCCC
ATTTG and GCTACCCCCAAGTTTAATGG primer
pair. Fragment of chromosomal DNA was amplified with
ACAAAGCAAAGGAGCTGGAG and TCATTGCCA
CTGCTGAGAAC primers. Taz expression was analyzed
with quantitative RT-PCR using murine Taz-specific
primers ATGCCCCTCCATGTGAAGTG and TGGT
TGGAGACGGTGATAAGG. Results are expressed rela￾tive to β-actin mRNA content, that was determined using
following primer set: AAGAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGA
and ACGGATGTCAACGTCACACT. Quantitative PCR
was performed using a Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf )
and SYBR Green RT-PCR reagent (Bio-Rad). PCR condi￾tions were 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C
for 35 cycles.

Western blot analysis
Western immunoblot analyses were done by standard
techniques using NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris pre-cast gels
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Tissues were homog￾enized in ice-cold buffer composed of 0.1 M KH2PO4,
2 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenates were
centrifuged at 12 000 × g at 4o C and protein concentra￾tions in supernatants were determined with the BCA
assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). After electrophoresis, pro￾teins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA overnight. Pro￾tein levels of ETC. complexes were detected with a cock￾tail of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to selected
subunits of the complexes (Life Technologies). Custom￾made antibodies specific to mitochondrial malate de￾hydrogenase (mMDH) were used for the loading control.
Secondary IRDye antibodies were used for imaging
(Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were
scanned with an Odyssey CLx scanner. Band intensity
analysis and data quantification were done with Image
Studio software.
Cardiolipin analysis
Tissue homogenates were made in Milli-Q water in a
Qiagen Tissuelyser II using stainless steel beads of 5 mm
for two times 30 s at 30 rev/s. The protein concentration
of the homogenates was determined with the BCA assay.
Phospholipids were extracted using a single-phase ex￾traction. An internal standard (CL(14:0)4 was added to
all samples containing 1 mg of protein followed by
1.5 mL of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Subsequently,
the mixtures were sonicated in the water bath for 5 min,
followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The
supernatants (organic layer) were then transferred to the
glass vials and evaporated under a nitrogen stream at
45 °C. Subsequently, the residues were dissolved in
150 μL of chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v), and 10 μL of
the solution was injected into the HPLC-MS system.
The HPLC system consisted of an Ultimate 3000
binary (U) HPLC pump, a vacuum degasser, a column
temperature controller, and an autosampler (Thermo Sci￾entific, Waltham, MA, USA). The column temperature
was maintained at 25 °C. The lipid extracts were injected
onto a LiChrospher 2* 250-mm silica-60 column, 5 μm
particle diameter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The
phospholipids were separated from interfering compounds
by a linear gradient between solution B (chloroform/
methanol, 97:3, v/v) and solution A (methanol/water,
85:15, v/v). Solutions A and B contained 5 and 0.2 ml of
25% (v/v) aqueous ammonia per liter of eluent, respect￾ively. The gradient (0.3 ml/min) was as follows: 0–1 min
10%A, 1–4 min, 10%A–20%A, 4–12 min 20%A–85% A;
12–12.1 min, 85%A–100% A; 12.1–14.0 min, 100% A, 14–
14.1 min, 100%A–10%A and 14.1–15 min, equilibration
with 10% A. All gradient steps were linear, and the total
analysis time, including the equilibration, was 15 min. A
Q Exactive Plus MS (Thermo Scientific) was used in the
negative and positive electrospray ionization mode. Nitro￾gen was used as the nebulizing gas. The source collision￾induced dissociation collision energy was set at 0 V. The
spray voltage was 2500 V, and the capillary temperature
was 256 °C. In both negative and positive modes, mass
spectra of phospholipid molecular species were obtained
by continuous scanning from m/z 150 to m/z 2000 with a
resolution of 280.000 (FMWH at m/z 200).
For bioinformatic analysis of the data, the raw HPLC/
MS data were converted to an mzXML format using
msConvert for the Negative Scan data and ReAdW for
the Positive Scan data. The data set was processed using
a semi-automated metabolomics pipeline written in the
R programming language [http://www.r-project.org]. In
brief, it consisted of the following five steps: (1) pre￾processing, (2) identification of metabolites, (3) isotope
correction, (4) normalization and scaling and (5) statis￾tical analysis, using the XCMS R package.
Isolation of mitochondria and analysis of ETC complex I-III
activity
Cardiac mitochondria were isolated and enzymatic ac￾tivities of complex I-III segment and citrate synthase
were measured spectrophotometrically, as previously
described [4].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis, reported as means ± standard devia￾tions, was performed with one-way ANOVA. Post-hoc
analyses of echocardiographic indices were performed
using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. For statis￾tical comparison of cardiolipin content between the
groups, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni cor￾rection was used. A probability value of 0.05 or lower
was considered significant.
Results
Chronic isoproterenol treatment exacerbates the cardiac
dysfunction in TazKD mice
Without stress, 4.5-month-old TazKD mice exhibited
normal systolic function and did not differ from WT
controls. We investigated whether chronic cardiac stress
secondary to β-adrenergic stimulation would aggravate
the cardiac phenotype in TazKD mice. Isoproterenol was
administered to 2.5-month-old WT and TazKD mice
using subcutaneously implanted micro-osmotic pumps.
Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function in
Iso-treated mice was performed at 4.5 months of age.
Results show that systolic indices were preserved in
Iso-treated WT mice (Fig. 1). In contrast, in TazKD

mice, treatment with Iso for 2 weeks unveiled significant
impairment in cardiac contractile function. Left ventricu￾lar ejection fraction (LV EF) and left ventricular fractional
shortening (LV FS) were markedly reduced in Iso-treated
TazKD mice compared to untreated TazKD mice or
Iso-treated WT controls, consistent with impending
cardiomyopathy (Fig. 1). Thus, TazKD in mice had no
obvious impact on systolic function at 4.5 months of age.
At the same age, TazKD mice undergoing an additional β￾adrenergic stress developed a more severe cardiac pheno￾type with impaired systolic function.
Bezafibrate ameliorates isoproterenol-induced heart failure
in TazKD mice
We investigated whether the PPAR agonist, BF might
ameliorate cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function
in Iso-treated TazKD mice. Cohorts of 4.5-month-old WT
and TazKD mice with implanted Iso-delivering micro￾osmotic pumps were given rodent chow that contained
0.5% BF. At the same time, the doxycycline administration
route was changed for all animals from rodent chow to
drinking water with 0.1% of doxycycline and 10% sucrose
because manufacturing and sterilizing the rodent chow that
contained both BF and doxycycline was technically difficult.
After 2 months on the BF-containing diet, cardiac
function in mice was examined by echocardiography. In
WT mice BF increased LV FS from 31 ± 9% in the
untreated group to 41 ± 10% (P < 0.05). LV EF was im￾proved from 57 ± 11% in the untreated group to 71 ±
13% in the BF-treated group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2b,c).
BF significantly improved cardiac function in Iso￾treated TazKD group. LV FS showed a dramatic increase

from 20 ± 2% in the untreated group to 36 ± 10% in the
BF-treated group (P < 0.001). LV EF was improved from
40 ± 2 in the untreated group to 65 ± 10% in the BF￾treated group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2b,c). TAZ knockdown in
Iso-treated model resulted in reduction of end-systolic
thickness of interventricular septum (IVS;d) from 1.10 ±
0.12 mm in WT group to 0.88 ± 0.15 mm in TazKD
group (P < 0.01). BF increased thickness of IVS;d in
TazKD mice to 1.21 ± 0.31 mm (P < 0.05), however, had
no impact on IVS;d in WT mice (Fig. 2d).
Bezafibrate treatment improves systolic function in
7-month-old TazKD mice
Next, we investigated the effects of extended BF treatment
on WT and TazKD mice without β-adrenergic stress.
Cohorts of WT and TazKD mice were subjected to echo￾cardiographic evaluation of cardiac function at 2.5, 4.5 and
7 months of age. TazKD mice with no β-adrenergic stress
exhibited normal contractile function at age of 4.5 months,
and systolic defects became apparent by age of 7 months,
consistent with previously reported studies in this mouse
model [1] (Fig. 2e,f ). TazKD mice at 7 months of age dem￾onstrated signs of cardiac dysfunction with impaired LV FS
(32 ± 8 and 24 ± 4% for WT and TazKD, respectively;
P < 0.05), and LV EF (59 ± 12 and 48 ± 7% for WT
and TazKD, respectively; P < 0.05).
Treatment with BF, starting from 3 months of age, pre￾vented the development of cardiomyopathy in 7-month￾old TazKD mice by preserving LV FS and EF indices. BF
increased LV FS values from 24 ± 4% for untreated group
to 32 ± 5% for BF-treated group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2g). Simi￾larly, LV EF values were 48 ± 7 and 61 ± 6% for untreated
and BF-treated TazKD groups, respectively (P < 0.001)
(Fig. 2h). Prolonged treatment with BF demonstrated a
tendency of increasing LV FS and LV EF values in 7-
month-old WT mice as well, although the difference did
not quite reach statistical significance.
Bezafibrate treatment reduces cardiolipin content and
alters its molecular speciation in cardiac muscle
In the next set of experiments, we analyzed impacts of BF
on content and molecular spectrum of CL species in
hearts of 7-month-old WT and TazKD mice. Cardiolipin
profiling revealed that molecular forms of CL with four
C18 acyl groups, corresponding to CL(72:7) and CL(72:8)
species, constitute approximately 80% of the total CL in
WT hearts (Fig. 3a). This is consistent with previous re￾ports [1, 19]. Doxycycline-inducible shRNA-mediated

gene knockdown reduced Taz mRNA level in cardiac
muscle of TazKD mice by 95%. BF had no impact on Taz
expression in cardiac muscle either in WT or in TazKD
mice (Fig. 3b). As expected, Taz knockdown reduced the
content of total CL and increased MLCL to CL ratio in
hearts TazKD mice (Fig. 3c, d). Surprisingly, treatment
with BF significantly reduced content of total CL and
increased MLCL/CL ratios both in WT and TazKD mice.
We further investigated impact of BF on CL molecular
speciation in WT and TazKD mouse hearts. In hearts of
WT mice BF reduced content of CL(72:7) and CL(72:8),
and increased a content of CLs with longer and more
unsaturated acyl groups (Fig. 3e). However, in TazKD
hearts BF increased the levels of CLs with shorter
and more saturated acyl groups such as CL(70:4),
CL(68:2) and CL(68:3) (Fig. 3e).
BF promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in cardiomyocytes
Quantitative PCR analysis of total DNA from mouse
hearts revealed an approximately 60% (P < 0.05) increase
of mtDNA content in the hearts of 7-month-old un￾treated TazKD mice compared to untreated WT coun￾terparts (Fig. 4a). Bezafibrate further increased mtDNA
content in LV muscle of TazKD mice approximately by
200% (P < 0.01). We also observed a similar increase in
mitochondrial citrate synthase activity in BF-treated
hearts, suggesting that BF enhances mitochondrial bio￾genesis in TazKD hearts (Fig. 4b). We have previously
reported that TazKD mice have impaired activity of
mitochondrial ETC. complexes I–III [4]. Bezafibrate in￾creased enzymatic activity of the segment I-III of ETC.
complexes in cardiac mitochondria by 35% (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 4c). Impact of BF on mitochondrial ETC. com￾plexes was further evaluated in protein extracts from LV
muscles by semi-quantitative western blot analysis using
the cocktail of antibodies specific to selected subunits of
ETC. complexes. Cardiac mitochondria isolated from
TazKD mice exhibited significantly reduced content of
all tested subunits of ETC. complexes. Treatment with
BF during 4 months showed tendency to increase pro￾tein expression of all ETC. complexes, although the dif￾ferences did not reach statistical significance, except for
NDUFA9 (complex I) (Fig. 4d).
Discussion
In humans with mutations in energy metabolism genes,
physiological stressors, such as fasting, cold exposure,
exercise, or infections can rapidly induce life-threatening
events in otherwise stable and asymptomatic patients
[20–22]. This is certainly the situation in BTHS. Simi￾larly, mouse models of energy metabolism disorders often
require additional physiological stressors, e.g. fasting,

cold-exposure, β-adrenergic stimulation or a high-fat diet,
to evoke a cardiac phenotype [23–26]. Isoproterenol, a β￾adrenergic agonist, acts as a specific pathological stressor
to exacerbate cardiac phenotypes and has become a useful
tool to study cardiac disorders in animal models [27].
Cardiomyopathy in humans with BTHS may present
earlier; prenatally or early postnatally. In mice, despite
the same genotype, two distinct phenotypes have been
reported. Prior reports of this model demonstrated that
cardiomyopathy develops only in adult mice, when
knockdown is induced with relatively low dose of doxy￾cycline (25–80 mg/kg/daily) [1, 7]. In contrast, fetal car￾diac defects and embryonic or early postnatal lethality
were observed when Taz knockdown was initiated in
utero with higher dose of doxycycline (~300 mg/kg/
daily) [8]. A plausible cause of distinct phenotypes of
these two models with the same genotype is the dose of
doxycycline. Seibler et al. showed that the dose of doxy￾cycline influenced the speed with which the knockdown
achieved a steady-state level [8, 28].
In this study, we show that β-adrenergic stimulation
resulted in LV systolic dysfunction in TazKD mice at
4.5 months of age, while in those not receiving a β￾adrenergic challenge, the cardiac phenotype becomes ap￾parent after 7 months of age. These results suggest that
Taz deficiency in adult mice is better compensated than
in humans and additional external stressors are neces￾sary to elicit the cardiac phenotype.
Bezafibrate is a pan-activator of PPAR signaling and
promotes transcriptional activation of genes involved in
oxidative metabolism [29]. BF activates PPAR-PGC1α
signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis in brain, amelior￾ating Huntington’s disease, mitochondrial encephalop￾athy and tau pathology phenotypes in mice [30–32]. BF
improves substrate metabolism and reduces right ven￾tricular hypertrophy in congestive heart failure model
[33]. Fibrates slow down the progression of the LV dys￾function in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [14].
Interestingly, overexpression of PGC1α induced mito￾chondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscles of cyto￾chrome c oxidase (complex IV) deficient mice. However,
BF failed to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and even
showed adverse effects on the skeletal muscles of mice
with various mitochondrial myopathies [34–36]. Pub￾lished reports suggest that BF may evoke distinct re￾sponses in different tissues: BF rescues mitochondrial
defects in liver, skin, spleen and heart inducing mito￾chondrial biogenesis in these tissues [13, 16, 36]. How￾ever, BF has no beneficial effects, or even could be
detrimental to glycolytic skeletal muscles [17, 34, 37].
BF is commonly prescribed to patients with dyslipid￾emia and diabetes. In humans, BF is used at 10 mg/kg
daily dose. At this dosage, BF is undetectable in plasma
and reportedly ineffective for PPAR activation in rodents.
The pharmacological effect on lipogenesis is achieved
by transcriptional down-regulation of sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1c in liver tissue via a PPAR￾independent mechanism. Low-dose BF (10 mg/kg/day)
failed to have any significant impact on the expres￾sion of PPARα, PGC1α and fatty acid oxidation genes
in the liver [29]. In rodents, BF is commonly adminis￾tered via a chow diet containing 0.5% of the drug that
corresponds to 600–800 mg/kg/daily dose. This dose
is approximately 60–80 times higher than the usual
dose for humans for the treatment of dyslipidemia
[30, 31, 34–36, 38]. At dosage of 0.5%, BF is well
tolerated by rodents. These observations prompted us
to use BF in the same dosage.
BF effectively ameliorated cardiac phenotypes in Iso￾treated TazKD mice. These experiments strongly suggest
that the PPAR/PGC1α signaling system is a promising
therapeutic target for cardiomyopathy in patients with
BTHS. However, Iso evokes complex responses in cardi￾omyocytes at high dosage (100 mg/kg) and may be toxic
to cells, promoting oxidative stress and apoptosis [39].
We wanted to show that the observed therapeutic effect
of BF on Iso-pretreated TazKD mice was not mediated
by the protection of the heart from β-adrenergic stress.
Thus, in the separate set of experiments, we adminis￾tered BF to mice without Iso pretreatment. In this series,
we administered BF for a prolonged period between 3
and 7 months of age. BF markedly improved contractile
function in TazKD mice at 7 months of age, showing
that therapeutic action of BF is not mediated by the pro￾tection of the heart from β-adrenergic stress.
Taz knockdown caused a significant increase of mtDNA
content and showed a tendency of increased citrate syn￾thase activity in cardiomyocytes. These observations are
indicative of adaptive mitochondrial proliferation in
TazKD cardiac muscle in response to energy deficiency
and are consistent with previous observations [1]. How￾ever, mitochondrial proliferation in hearts of untreated
TazKD mice was accompanied by reduction of electron
flow through CI-III segment of ETC. and diminished con￾tent of several subunits of ETC. complexes. These obser￾vations are consistent with previously reported proteomic
studies on TazKD mice [3]. BF further increased mito￾chondrial DNA content, citrate synthase activity, partially
augmented electron flow through the CI-CIII segment of
ETC. and demonstrated a tendency to increase expression
of ETC. proteins in TazKD mice. Interestingly, an increase
of the CI-III activity occurred despite the deterioration of
CL content in the mitochondria. It is plausible that an
increased turnover rates of individual subunits or chaper￾ones of ETC. complexes I and III compensate for enzyme
deficiency, even if CL is depleted in the mitochondria.
Although BF had no effect on Taz expression, it
caused notable changes in molecular speciation of

cardiolipin. BF significantly reduced content of tetralino￾leoyl CL and increased content of MLCLs in cardiac
muscle. In WT group, BF increased content of minor CL
species with (76:12) – (76:10) acyl groups corresponding
to C19 odd chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 3e).
However, in TazKD group, there was an opposite shift
towards to CL species with shorter and less-saturated
side chains. The physiological significance of these shifts
is unclear.
Conclusion
In summary, the principal findings of this study are: 1)
Iso exacerbates the cardiac phenotype in TazKD mice
rapidly by inducing dilated cardiomyopathy and LV sys￾tolic dysfunction by 4.5 months of age, and 2) the pan￾PPAR agonist BF effectively prevents development of LV
dilation and LV systolic dysfunction in TazKD mice. The
study raised some points that require further investiga￾tion. First, cardiac function of TazKD mice improves in
response to BF treatment despite deterioration of CL, a
classical biomarker of BTHS. This striking outcome is
likely to be caused by increased mitochondrial biogen￾esis in BF-treated hearts without parallel upregulation of
tafazzin or other CL-remodeling enzymes. To our know￾ledge, this is a first experimental observation of improving
cardiac function in the settings of diminished cellular
levels of CL. Precise mechanisms underlying this improve￾ment are unclear. Our results suggest that BF-induced
biogenesis of more CL-depleted and therefore, less effi￾cient mitochondria, are sufficient to reverse an adverse
cardiac phenotype and improve heart contractility in
TazKD mice. Second, bezafibrate dosage in our mouse
model is 60–80 times higher than the therapeutic dose for
humans. BF is well tolerated in humans. Subjective side￾effects from the gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain and
nausea) occur in some patients that received equivalent of
17–20 mg/kg daily dose [40]. However, use of a higher
dose of BF in potential human trials would be challenging.
Therefore, a minimal effective dose should be experimen￾tally determined first in the animal model with organ-level
pharmacokinetic analysis, conservative assessment of end￾organ toxicity and L4CL/MLCL levels.
