Abstract
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), which includes a 
range of disorders of different severity and is one of 
the most prevalent types of liver disease worldwide, 
has recently regained increased attention. Among 
other reasons, the realisation that any alcohol intake, 
regardless of type of beverage represents a health risk, 
and the new therapeutic strategies tested in recently 
published or undergoing clinical trials spur scientific 
interest in this area.
In April 2019, Gut convened a round table panel of 
experts during the European Association for the Study 
of the Liver International Liver Congress in Vienna 
to discuss critical and up-to-date issues and clinical 
trial data regarding ALD, its epidemiology, diagnosis, 
management, pathomechanisms, possible future 
treatments and prevention. This paper summarises the 
discussion and its conclusions.
Introduction
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is one of the 
most prevalent types of liver disease worldwide. 
According to the latest WHO estimates, alcoholic 
beverage consumption globally resulted in 3million 
alcohol-attributable deaths (5.3% of all deaths 
worldwide in 2016) and 5.1% of the global disease 
burden in 2016. Furthermore, it is estimated that 
alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis (AC) caused 607 
000 deaths and 22.2million disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) in 2016.1
Alcohol can interfere with lipid metabolism and 
induce fat deposition in the liver through different 
mechanisms, including inhibition of mitochondrial 
β-oxidation and increased fatty acid synthesis, 
resulting in the accumulation of triglycerides, 
phospholipids and cholesterol esters.2
 Hepatic 
inflammation, histologically referred to as alco￾holic steatohepatitis (ASH), may ensue in some 
individuals, with histological signs of hepatocellular 
injury and ballooning. While initially involving 
innate immunity, it may be followed by an adap￾tive immune response triggered by neoantigens 
derived from alcohol metabolism.2
 In a subset of 
patients, heavy alcohol consumption resulting in 
chronic inflammation and injury leads to extracel￾lular matrix deposition and fibrosis. In ALD pericel￾lular and perisinusoidal matrix accumulation with 
a ‘chicken-wire’ appearance is a common pattern 
of fibrosis. Advanced fibrosis results in severe 
derangement of hepatic architecture, with predom￾inant fibrous tissue over the parenchymal compo￾nent and impairment of blood flow, characteristics 
of the cirrhotic stage. Chronic liver injury, oxida￾tive stress, inflammation and fibrosis, together with 
the carcinogenic action of alcohol metabolites may 
ultimately lead to DNA mutations, the neoplastic 
transformation of hepatocytes and development of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Chronic alcohol abuse over months or years 
results in most patients developing an alcoholic 
fatty liver. Up to a third of the individuals who 
continue with heavy alcohol drinking progress to 
ASH, and up to 20% will develop AC. About 2% of 
cirrhotic patients develop primary HCC. In patients 
with severe ASH an acute condition characterised 
by jaundice and liver failure, acute alcoholic hepa￾titis (AH), may occur. Among patients surviving 
acute AH, 70% will progress to cirrhosis. In addi￾tion, cirrhotic individuals may develop acute AH 
(acute-on-chronic condition) with severe mortality 
rates.2
 (figure 1)
ALD may be observed even in the absence of 
clinical or biological manifestations, therefore it is 
often diagnosed at a very late stage.
Recently, ALD has gained an increased interest 
not only among researchers, but also among socio￾economic and community health stakeholders. 
A major genetic study debunking the apparent 
protective effects of moderate alcohol consump￾tion against stroke and demonstrating the direct 
and uniform association between increased alcohol 
intake and cardiovascular events,3
 and a number 
of clinical trials recently published or currently 
underway have regained the attention of the scien￾tific community.
In April 2019, Gut convened a round table panel 
of experts during the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Liver 
Congress in Vienna to discuss critical and up-to￾date issues and clinical trial data regarding ALD,

This paper summarises the discussion and key messages.
Epidemiology
Global burden
The global burden of disease caused by the harmful use of 
alcohol is enormous. Worldwide more than half million indi￾viduals died in the year 2016, due to alcohol-related cirrhosis, 
with an associated loss of 22.2million DALYs in the same year.1
In fact, the alcohol-attributable fraction (ie, the contribution 
alcohol has as a risk factor to disease or death) regarding global 
deaths or DALYs, is about 50% for cirrhosis, and 10% for liver 
cancer, according to the WHO report on Alcohol and Health.1
However, the death rates associated with digestive disease, 
evaluated by the WHO (mostly liver cirrhosis), very much vary 
among different regions of the world, from less than 1.9 to more 
than 17 per 100 000 individuals. It is of note that the calculation 
of the alcohol-attributable fraction was not based on Interna￾tional Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding, since there is a 
strong interaction between other factors such as viral hepatitis 
or obesity and metabolic risk factors.4
Geographical differences
Interestingly, the burden of alcohol-attributable digestive deaths 
(liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis and other digestive diseases) is 
highest in Africa and the Western Pacific (16.9 and 10.8 deaths 
per 100 000, respectively), while the contribution of alcohol to 
digestive diseases is highest in Europe and the Western Pacific 
(30.5% and 28.9%, respectively).1
 This may be partly explained 
by the socioeconomic status modifying the effect of alcohol 
consumption and the structure of mortality and morbidity in 
different regions.
Europe
Data from the HEPAHEALTH project that aggregates by broad 
categories of liver disease for the most recent years available, 
shows that alcohol is a large contributor to the mortality rate of 
many European countries.5
 Mortality from unknown causes also 
appears frequently, probably due to reluctance to put an alcohol 
aetiology in death certificates. This makes it difficult to evaluate 
the true prevalence.
Prevalence
The prevalence of advanced ALD probably ranges between 
2% and 5% in at-risk populations, with substantial differences 
according to age, gender and drinking history. The first pivotal 
population-based study, the Dionysos Study, investigated 6534 
adult Italians from two municipalities. While 21% reported 
drinking above 30g/day, evidence of cirrhosis was found in only 
2%.6
 This was however before elastography appeared as a highly 
accurate method for assessment of advanced fibrosis.
In a primary care population of 20868 patients from the 
UK, 7% exhibited hazardous drinking. Four hundred and one 
of these patients underwent liver stiffness measurement, with 
19% having values above 8.0kPa and 3% were diagnosed with 
cirrhosis.7
 Similarly, in a Danish biopsy-controlled study including 
128 asymptomatic patients from primary care with a history of 
excess drinking, 2% had severe fibrosis and 4% had cirrhosis.8
 A 
recent study investigated a background population in Catalonia, 
Spain, and found that 9% reported risk drinking behaviour. 
Of these, 7% had liver stiffness above 9.0kPa.9
 Global annual 
alcohol consumption is steadily increasing, from 5.9L per-capita 
in 1990 to 6.5 L in 2017, particularly in middle-income coun￾tries.10 As alcohol consumption is projected to further increase 
to 7.6 L in 2030, in parallel with an increasing prevalence of 
current drinkers and a decrease in lifetime abstainers, the burden 
of ALD will most likely also continue to rise.
Mortality
Recent years have seen an increase in mortality due to ALD. In 
the USA, alcohol exceeds hepatitis C virus as the primary aeti￾ology for liver related deaths due to a continued, linear increase 
in age-standardised mortality since 2007, with annual increases 
of 3.4%11 (figure 2). It is also of concern that the increase in 
mortality in the USA seems to affect younger age groups. The 
percental increase in mortality due to AC is higher than for 
cirrhosis in general in age groups 45 years and upwards, but the 
steepest incline in mortality of AC is in the age group 25 to 34 
years, growing more than 10% annually.12
Underreporting of ALD
ALD cannot be measured reliably using usual death registries 
since the assessment of whether a liver disease is due to alcohol 
use or other risk factors is dependent on sociocultural factors, 
particularly stigma. It was found in a seminal study by Puffer and 
Griffith published in the 1960s that after triangulating data on 
death certificates with data from hospital records and interviews

with doctors or family members the number of deaths with AC 
more than doubled, with recoding from cirrhosis that does not 
mention alcohol.13 There is evidence of persistent underre￾porting of ALD. It is therefore suggested that the estimate should 
be based on measures that have less bias such as the alcohol￾attributable fractions of cirrhosis.14
Hazardous drinking
Hazardous drinking is the mainstay of ALD. Hazardous drinking 
is broadly defined as alcohol consumption in a quantity or 
pattern that puts the patient at risk for adverse health outcomes. 
For liver-related events, there is no clear threshold for how much 
alcohol constitutes a significantly increased risk, or for a minimum 
duration of excessive drinking.15 In spite of the lacking threshold 
effect, several studies and meta-analyses denote 30g of alcohol 
daily as the limit marking a clinically significant elevated risk of 
progressing to advanced liver disease.16 The EASL guideline on 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) uses a threshold for 
daily alcohol ingestion of 30 g for men and 20 g for women 
to delimit ALD from NAFLD17 while the American Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases NAFLD guidance18 refrains from 
defining a limit of drinking for discriminating between ALD and 
NAFLD. They do however suggest using >21 drinks/week for 
men and >14 drinks/week for women over a 2year period as 
exclusion criteria for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis clinical trials. 
A similar criterium could be used in « reverse » for inclusion of 
patients in ALD trials, but more often ALD trials include patients 
drinking in excess of 30g/day, or even 60g/day. The unclear 
definition of what constitutes hazardous drinking therefore has 
obvious consequences for the patient characteristics of future 
clinical trials in ALD and their comparability.
Less evidence exists regarding lifetime exposure and the 
importance of abstinence periods.
Early-life excess drinking increases the risk of severe liver 
disease later in life. In 18- to 19-year-old Swedish males, who 
reported drinking more than 30g/day (4% of participants), the 
cumulative incidence of severe liver disease was 3% during 38±5 
years of follow-up. The crude HRs increased from 5.0 (2.4 to 
10.6) in those who drank 31 to 40g/day, to 11.1 (5.2 to 23.4) 
in those who drank >60g/day.
16 However, the main limitation 
of this and other studies is the inability to adjust for lifetime 
changes in alcohol use. Patients with an alcohol use disorder 
(AUD) may illustrate the effect of prolonged, heavy drinking. 
A Danish case-control study investigated 14091 men and 4911 
women who attended alcohol rehabilitation from 1977 to 2013. 
Liver-related mortality in these patients was 14% for both sexes, 
with corresponding relative risks of 5.6 for men and 11.7 for 
women, when compared with population controls.19
The UK Million Women Study confirmed that cirrhosis inci￾dence increases with the amount of alcohol consumed (relative 
risk (RR) 3.4 (2.9 to 4.1) in those drinking more than 16g/day 
vs 8 to 16 g/week). The study also found that cirrhosis incidence 
among women who consumed more than 56 g of alcohol weekly 
(corresponding to seven drinks) doubled with daily consumption 
versus non-daily consumption, and not drinking with meals (RR 
2.5, 2.0 to 3.1).15
Genetic factors
The heritability for AC is well known.20 The genetic dispo￾sition is probably polygenic, as evidenced by a three times 
higher concordance of AC in monozygotic twins compared 
with dizygotic, irrespective of concordance for alcoholism, in 
a single twin study.21 There is however far more evidence on 
the genetic aspects of alcohol dependence than on ALD, with 
the most recent meta-analysis on twin studies suggesting 49% 
heritability.22 As an example, single polymorphisms in the genes 
encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydroge￾nase protects against AUDs by a slower metabolism of acetalde￾hyde, causing unpleasant symptoms such as flushing and nausea 
after alcohol consumption. These gene variants will invariably, 
although indirectly, also protect against ALD.
While several individual genetic variants have been identi￾fied for AC, they are rarely independently validated and repro￾duced.23 This may be because controls are consistently difficult 
to match correctly with regards to alcohol exposure, drinking 
pattern and additional lifestyle risk factors. The only polymor￾phism that has been consistently correlated with cirrhosis and 
HCC in patients with ALD is the patatin-like phospholipase 
domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 polymorphism.24
Effect size is small however, with ORs between 1.5 and 2.2. 
The same PNPLA3 polymorphism may also be associated with 
reduced long-term survival after an episode of severe AH (sAH), 
but this finding remains to be repeated.25 Additional promising 
polymorphisms include HSD17B13, TM6SF2, MBOAT7 and 
SERPINA1.26
The heterozygous carriage of the alpha1-antitrypsin Pi*Z 
variant was associated with an increased risk for alcohol misusers 
to develop cirrhosis, with an adjusted OR of 5.8.27
Other risk factors
The interaction of other risk factors with alcohol concerning 
the risk of developing liver disease has been neglected in recent 
years. However, several studies have shown an additive effect 
of overweight or obesity with alcohol consumption in the risk 
of developing liver disease or in fibrosis severity.28 29 Trem￾bling et al found in a large cohort of postmenopausal women 
that those who were overweight or obese and drank the most 
alcohol had the highest risk of developing liver related events. 
However also abstainers had an increased risk.30 This last obser￾vation highlights the controversial issue of moderate amounts of 
alcohol having the potential to be protective as several studies 
suggest.31 32
However, a recent study from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study, found that risk of all-cause mortality rises with increasing

Key messages from the round table discussion regarding 
epidemiology
► Improve the codification systems of death certificates.
► Set up selected representative sentinel centres for in￾depth evaluation of the cause of liver disease for admitted 
patients to define attributable fractions for cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma in each country.
► Undertake more translational research on the associated 
risk factors regarding the development and progression of 
alcohol-related liver disease.
► Undertake population studies with long-term clinical follow￾up of patients including accurate non-invasive assessment of 
liver disease severity.
► Assess how both short-term and long-term fluctuations in 
drinking influence risk of liver damage.
► Map genetic susceptibility as genetic risk scores, beyond 
single nucleotide polymorphisms.
levels of consumption, and that there is no safe lower level of 
consumption.33
Another important cofactor in ALD is iron; in fact, iron over￾load is frequently present, in the absence of a specific iron over￾load disease. However, since haemochromatosis is one of the 
most common genetic conditions, it should always be considered 
a cofactor for ALD.34
A prospective cohort study found that there was a synergism 
between obesity and alcohol in increasing the risk of HCC.35
The reason for the interaction between overweight and alcohol 
on the risk of liver disease is not fully explained but may be 
caused by the effect of many adipose tissue-induced systemic 
inflammatory pathways.36 In fact, a Scottish study demonstrated 
that the harm to health as well as the rates of alcohol-induced 
hospitalisation or death are strongly predicted by social status.37
The adjustment for drinking pattern or binge drinking did not 
make a significant difference. However, controlling for body 
mass index and cigarette smoking (CS) attenuated the differ￾ence, suggesting the strong association of alcohol abuse with 
CS and obesity. In fact, patients with alcohol abuse have an 
elevated prevalence of heavy CS.38 Also, there is evidence that 
CS may exacerbate the pathogenic effects of alcohol on the liver 
and heavy CS aggravates the harmful effect of alcohol excess 
in humans, signifying that both factors may have a synergistic 
effect.39
Alcohol consumption was shown to be associated, with faster 
development and earlier mortality in patients with chronic hepa￾titis B or hepatitis C virus infection.40
Regarding coffee consumption, a recent study in Norway 
including 219279 men and women aged 30 to 67 years, found 
an inverse correlation between coffee consumption and ALD.41
Also, a prospective analysis of 14208 participants aged 45 to 
64 years from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study 
found that coffee drinkers may be at lower risk for liver-related 
hospitalisation.42
Economic burden and late diagnosis
With regards to the economic burden of ALD, a recent study in 
the USA has shown that in 1240152 patients admitted between 
2002 and 2014 with cirrhosis, AC accounts for more than half 
of the cirrhosis charges.43 The elevated mortality and costs of 
ALD is at least partially due to the fact that it is often detected at 
very advanced stages of the disease, compared with other liver 
diseases.44
Diagnosis of ALD
The diagnosis of ALD should begin with the assessment of alcohol 
use in all patients including the levels and patterns of alcohol 
consumption, signs of AUD and advanced liver disease. ALD is 
usually suspected in patients with a regular alcohol consumption 
larger than 20 g/day in females and larger than 30g/day in males, 
together with clinical and/or biological abnormalities suggesting 
liver injury.
When it comes to screening risky drinking and alcohol depen￾dence, AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Test) is consid￾ered to be the most valuable questionnaire.45 It includes 10 items 
that explore alcohol consumption using three questions, alcohol 
dependence also using three questions and alcohol-related 
problems with further four questions. A score over 8 indicates 
harmful use of alcohol. Its shorter version includes only the 
first three questions of AUDIT. This version is reliable for rapid 
screening of alcohol use.46
Among the serum markers to detect alcohol consumption are 
carbohydrate deficient transferrin and gamma-glutamyl trans￾ferase (GGT). Their predictive values have been validated to 
detect alcohol consumption higher than 50g/day within the 2 
or 3 previous weeks. However, those markers are less useful in 
patients with liver disease as liver injury is a confounding factor 
that affects their diagnostic value to detect heavy drinking.45
For example, the GGT level is elevated in patients with exten￾sive fibrosis regardless of the cause, even in patients with a long 
period of abstinence.
Alcohol-related liver injury may be diagnosed even in the 
absence of clinical or biological symptoms. The degree of 
steatosis and liver fibrosis needs to be established. Liver biopsy is 
still considered the gold standard for the definite diagnosis and 
for assessing the fibrosis stage of ALD. However, as it is an inva￾sive procedure, it is associated with side effects and therefore not 
always recommended.
In the last 15 years, a number of non-invasive tests have been 
developed to assess the degree of liver fibrosis and steatosis 
on which the round table discussion was focussing regarding 
diagnosis.
Non-invasive methods depend either on
► a physical methodology based on the measurement of liver 
stiffness (transient elastography (TE)), or
► a biological methodology based on the quantification of 
serum biomarkers.
In ALD, TE has been shown to reliably detect advanced fibrosis 
and cirrhosis and can therefore act as a prognostic marker of 
clinical outcomes.47 A meta-analysis to determine specific diag￾nostic cut-off values for liver stiffness in alcohol-related fibrosis 
has analysed biopsy-proven FibroScan studies on liver stiffness in 
ALD. It highlights the link between liver stiffness and the histo￾logical features of asymptomatic and non-severe AH. Aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) levels and cholestasis had a significant 
effect on liver stiffness and must therefore be considered when 
interpreting liver stiffness cut-offs.48
Non-invasive biological serum tests can be grouped into two 
classes :
► patented methods such as FibroTest, FibroMeter and 
enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test.
► non-patented methods of which the best known are APRI 
(AST to Platelet Ratio Index), FIB-4 (Fibrosis-4) and Forns 
index.49

Key messages from the round table discussion regarding 
diagnosis of alcohol-related liver disease
► In all cases of liver disease alcohol consumption should be 
assessed in terms of its level and patterns.
► More trials are needed to confirm advantages and limitations 
of the different non-invasive diagnostic techniques and their 
combinations.
► More validated trials should be undertaken to find a 
biomarker as a proxy measure for alcohol use for clinical and 
research purposes.
In a recent prospective study of 10 liver fibrosis markers, the 
two most commonly used blood-based assessment tools for liver 
fibrosis FibroTest and ELF have been found to have a compa￾rable high performance for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis 
in ALD, with a lower performance for non-patented methods. 
No conclusion can be reached regarding FibroMeter, another 
patented method, as this method was not evaluated. Diagnostic 
accuracy of ELF, FibroTest and liver stiffness measurement was 
very similar.8
New serum biomarkers are under investigation to non￾invasively diagnose more severe forms of ALD and to predict the 
prognosis of patients.
A recent study comparing TE with TE plus FibroTest found 
no improvement in diagnostic accuracy for the combination.50
Although ultrasound is still used for screening for steatosis and 
portal hypertension, new methods such as controlled attenuation 
parameter have recently been developed to detect steatosis.51
MRI techniques are accurate and repeatable, however they are 
often not available and expensive to use.
Due to the progress in the development of non-invasive 
methods for the diagnosis of cirrhosis, it can be expected and 
would be desirable, that the next decade will bring large-scale 
screening for cirrhosis.
Management of ALD
Patients with ALD should be managed by specialists in liver 
disease as well as in addiction. The basic principles of manage￾ment in patients with ALD include the achievement of complete 
abstinence from alcohol use and the management of complica￾tions of cirrhosis such as ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 
encephalopathy and oesophageal varices. In addition, extrahe￾patic complications of alcohol use, such as neuropathy, prox￾imal myopathy, pancreatitis or pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, 
should be sought and addressed. Protein and calorie dietary defi￾ciency, often associated with sarcopaenia are commonly present 
and should be treated by a specialist dietician where available.
Many patients with ALD can stop drinking without much 
difficulties, but those dependent should receive adequate therapy 
to enable them to become abstinent. Concerning liver disease, 
it is important to exclude liver diseases of other origin and to 
treat relevant comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
There are currently no specific treatments for patients with 
ALD and there are very few trials in this patient population.
Management of alcoholic hepatitis
Next to HCC, AH is the most serious manifestation of ALD as 
it can lead to severe complications and early death. It is a clin￾ical entity characterised by rapid development of jaundice and 
liver-related complications in a patient with heavy long-term 
alcohol use.2
 The severity of AH is assessed by the Maddrey’s 
discriminant function (mDF) or by the Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD) score. SAH, commonly defined by a 
mDF ≥32or MELD score >20, occurs predominantly on a 
background of cirrhosis, and is associated with poor short-term 
prognosis.45
Given the risk of complications, patients with suspected AH 
should be admitted to hospital for management.
In patients with confounding factors (eg, suspicion of drug￾induced liver injury, atypical laboratory tests, suspicion of isch￾aemic hepatitis, etc) a transjugular biopsy can help to establish a 
definite diagnosis.52 The AH Histological Score also has a prog￾nostic value for these patients.53
Recent studies found that biomarkers such as cytokeratin-18 
fragments, soluble cluster of differentiation 14, lipopolysac￾charide binding protein (LBP), osteopontin (a multifunctional 
phosphoprotein involved in neutrophil activation) and circu￾lating levels of macrophage activation sCD163 and sCD206t can 
indicate severity and predict clinical outcomes in AH helping the 
management of the disease.54 55
General support includes providing adequate calorie and 
protein intake, as well as vitamins (ie, thiamine, folate and 
pyridoxine) and preventing/treating withdrawal syndrome in 
patients with alcohol dependence.
Patients with AH are prone to develop acute kidney injury 
(AKI) that heavily impacts short-term prognosis.56 A scoring 
system (AKI-AH) is useful for predicting AKI.57
Development of AKI is favoured by the existence of systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that could be due to 
bacterial infections or sterile inflammation.58 While waiting for 
culture results, serum procalcitonin may be a useful biomarker to 
suspect sepsis-induced SIRS. Since infection is a major prognostic 
factor in these patients, a complete infection screen is mandatory 
at admission and if patients develop fever, SIRS criteria or deteri￾oration in liver or renal function. A recent study showed that the 
risk of developing an infection was lower in patients with AH 
receiving antibiotics after gastrointestinal bleeding.59 Clinical 
trials evaluating the specific role of antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, 
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) in patients with AH are currently 
taking place.
In the absence of contraindications, corticosteroids are 
currently used in patients with sAH.60
The short-term survival benefit of corticosteroid treatment 
has been confirmed in a recent meta-analysis that included the 
Steroids or Pentoxifylline for Alcoholic Hepatitis (STOPAH) 
trial.61 However, the survival benefit associated with cortico￾steroids is modest and transient as the benefit does not persist 
beyond 28 days. Moreover, not all patients benefit from this 
therapy. This can be partly explained by the fact that the prog￾nosis for patients with sAH is heterogeneous. At one end of the 
spectrum, patients with sAH who have spontaneous improve￾ment in liver function in the days following admission have a 
better prognosis than patients without spontaneous improve￾ment.62 The benefit of corticosteroids has never been demon￾strated in this subgroup of patients. A clinical trial evaluating 
this question is ongoing (NCT03160651). At the other end of 
the spectrum, AH patients with (multi)organ failure have a very 
poor prognosis.
Two recent randomised controlled trials63 64 and a recent 
meta-analysis of individual data61 confirmed that pentoxifylline 
is ineffective.
Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a patient’s base￾line hepatic gene expression could predict the response to corti￾costeroids, although they are not used in clinical practice.58 65

Key message from the round table regarding management 
of alcoholic hepatitis
► Healthcare professionals should focus more on the diagnosis 
of non-severe alcoholic hepatitis.
For patients not responding to corticosteroids, as assessed by 
the Lille model for AH, there are no effective targeted thera￾pies. However, several encouraging pilot studies have yielded to 
larger clinical trials testing new pathophysiologically-orientated 
approaches.
Besides improving short-term survival, the most important 
determinant of long-term outcome in patients surviving an 
episode of AH is complete alcohol abstinence that needs to be 
promoted and assisted.
As non-severe forms of acute AH often respond to alcoholic 
abstinence, healthcare professionals should focus more on their 
diagnosis.52
In the last years, increasing number of hospitals are offering 
early liver transplantation (LT) for highly selected patients with 
AH non-responding to medical therapy.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an entity that occurs in 
patients with cirrhosis and is characterised by acute deterioration, 
organ failure and a high risk of short-term mortality. The EASL￾Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) consortium proposed a definition 
and diagnostic criteria for ACLF based on a large multicentre 
European cohort including all patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis, the CANONIC study.68 According to this study, the 
grade of ACLF was defined by the number of organ failures 
determined by the CLIF Consortium Organ Failure score (an 
adapted and simplified version of the sequential organ assess￾ment score), and the presence of kidney and/or neurological 
dysfunction.69 In the CANONIC study, AC with active alcohol 
consumption represented about 25% of the cases of ACLF. 
Interestingly, although liver biopsy results were not reported, 
laboratory features and the prescription of corticosteroids in a 
significant proportion of this group of patients highly suggest 
AH is a frequent cause of ACLF. Moreover, patients with AC 
and active alcohol consumption more often have ACLF grade 
2 and 3 than other patients. In a prospective cohort of patients 
with sAH, the 28day cumulative incidence of death in patients 
without ACLF or with ACLF grades 1, 2 or 3 was 10%, 31%, 
58% and 72%, respectively.70 (figure 4).
If corticosteroid administration improves short-term survival 
in patients with sAH and ACLF is currently unknown, as the 
majority of these patients are excluded from clinical trials. In a 
Belgian cohort of sAH patients, the probability of response to 
corticosteroids using the Lille model was reduced in patients with 
ACLF and progressively reduced among grades of ACLF (77% 
for patients with sAH and without ACLF, 52% for ACLF-1, 42% 
for ACLF-2 and 8% for ACLF-3).70 (figure 5). In a subanalysis 
of the STOPAH trial, a decreased chance of response using the 
Lille model and greater mortality with higher ACLF grades were 
also reported.71 However, the survival benefit of corticosteroids 
is maintained in responders (using the Lille model), irrespective 
of ACLF grade. Therefore, the optimal therapeutic strategy in 
patients with sAH and ACLF is still a matter of debate and needs 
further investigation.

Liver transplant in ALD
ALD represents the second most common indication for LT 
worldwide,72 accounting for about 30% of all primary trans￾plants in Europe and about 25% in the USA.73 74 Over the last 
two decades there has been a constant improvement in post￾transplant survival rates, which are comparable with those of LT 
for other aetiologies.73 However, ALD is still sometimes consid￾ered a controversial indication to LT mainly due to the percep￾tion that it is a self-inflicted disease,75 and due to the potential 
risk of alcohol relapse after LT with a negative impact on the 
new graft. Although most transplant programmes still require 
a 6month period of abstinence as a mandatory criterion to 
consider a patient suitable for LT, the role of the pre-transplant 
length of abstinence as predictor of alcohol relapse after LT has 
never been demonstrated. This period is becoming an instrument 
to assess patients who could recover their liver function after a 
prolonged alcohol abstinence and therefore could avoid unnec￾essary LT. Conversely, a multidisciplinary assessment, involving 
several stakeholders such as a transplant hepatologist, transplant 
surgeon, psychologist, psychiatrist and addiction specialist is 
becoming mandatory to properly evaluate the presence of risk 
factors for alcohol relapse after LT.45 76 77
The rates of alcohol relapse ranged from 11.5% to 49%, 
although this was rarely a consideration when looking for 
reasons for graft failure in ALD patients.78 Relapse directly 
leading to graft dysfunction ranged from 0% to 17%, whereas 
relapse directly causing mortality ranged from 0% to 5%. About 
10% of patients relapse into heavy drinking usually within the 
first year after LT.79
Although there is evidence that a shorter prelisting abstinence 
period corresponds to a shorter period before post-transplant 
relapse, the ideal period of abstinence pre-transplant is still 
debatable.80
Moreover, regular testing for detecting any alcohol use during 
the evaluation process or while the patients are on the waiting 
list is mandatory. Lastly, the role of donor/recipient gender 
mismatch should be explored in LT for ALD, as data reported 
worse outcomes when grafts from female donors are used in 
male recipients.81
LT for sAH
With regards to early LT for sAH not responding to medical 
therapy, there is increasing evidence that if LT is performed 
in selected patients it represents an effective treatment. Post￾transplant outcomes are good67 82 83 with survival rates that are 
significantly higher when compared with patients with sAH 
not responding to medical therapy and not transplanted82 and 
similar to those of ALD cirrhotic LT patients.83 Despite the good 
results reported, some ethical and social issues persist regarding 
the role of early LT for patients with sAH. These mainly rely 
on the potential reduction of organ donations because of the 
public perception that a graft is offered to patients who were 
actively drinking just before admission to the waiting list, with 
an increased risk of post-transplant alcohol relapse. However, 
available data shows that, when a strict selection process is 
applied to this special population of patients, relapse rates are 
comparable to those reported in ALD patients who underwent 
LT after 6month of pre-transplant abstinence.67 82 83 Further 
studies are ongoing to confirm these preliminary results.84 Lastly, 
a strong variability exists in terms of access to LT for sAH, with 
differences that are evident also at a national level with a poten￾tial inequity among patients with the same disease. This issue 
needs to be resolved through the development of international 
and national consensus on criteria for listing and transplanting 
patients with sAH.85 In Italy, patients with sAH can be consid￾ered potential candidates for LT only if strict criteria are met, as 
recently published in a position paper.77 The first Italian expe￾rience was reported by Germani et al86 who evaluated patients 
admitted for sAH at the Multivisceral Transplant Unit of Padua 
University Hospital (between January 2013 to June 2018). Out 
of 25 patients with sAH, 18 (72%) were non-responders to 
medical therapy and underwent the selection process. Among 
these, nine patients were placed on the waiting list and seven out 
of nine underwent LT. Six-month survival after LT was signifi￾cantly higher in patients with sAH who underwent LT compared 
with patients who were considered not suitable for LT (100% vs 
43%; p=0.03). At a median follow-up of 2.5 years, one patient 
experienced alcohol relapse.

Key messages from the round table discussion regarding 
transplant in patients with alcohol-related liver disease
► Future studies are needed to better define liver 
transplantation selection criteria for patients without any 
effective medical therapeutic option.
► Further studies should identify the main predictors of 
relapse of drinking in order to optimise patient selection and 
management.
Further studies should identify the main predictors of relapse 
of drinking in these patients in order to optimise patient selec￾tion and management.
LT in patients with ACLF
Due to the very poor prognosis for these patients, the option 
of LT for patients with ACLF (particularly grade 2 and 3) is 
frequently considered. Although some groups have recently 
reported acceptable 1year survival post-LT (including patients 
with ACLF-3),87 this topic is highly controversial. In addition 
to the need for strict selection criteria to minimise the risk of 
alcohol relapse after LT, the question of objective limits beyond 
which the patient must be considered too sick for LT remains 
unanswered. Future studies are needed to better define LT selec￾tion criteria for those patients without any effective medical 
therapeutic option.
LT in patients with HCC associated with ALD
HCC is one of the main causes of cancer-related death and its 
mortality is increasing worldwide. In Europe, alcohol abuse 
accounts for about half of liver cancer cases and it will become 
the leading cause of HCC in the future. LT for patients with 
HCC represents the best possible treatment in case of tumour 
recurrence or progression despite locoregional or surgical treat￾ments. Long-term results after LT for HCC associated with ALD 
are good. However, cardiovascular disease and other de novo 
malignancies can significantly hamper patients’ survival and 
should be carefully considered by the transplant team.88
Animal models
Over the last five decades many animal models for the study of 
the pathogenesis of ALD have been developed and are useful 
to study the different stages of ALD (see figure 6). Recently, 
one of the major advances in the field of ALD research was the 
introduction of binge alcohol intake into chronically ethanol-fed 
mice, causing neutrophilia, hepatic neutrophil infiltration and 
significant liver injury.89 This is useful for the study of the early 
stage of ASH. Briefly, mice were fed chronically the Lieber‐
DeCarli ethanol diet for 10 days, followed by gavaging a single 
dose of ethanol.89 This model was orignially called the NIAAA 
model89 and later was also called the Gao-binge model.90 91 Due 
to easy, short and reproducible feeding protocol, this model has 
been now widely used to study early stages of ASH and mild 
AH.92 Binge ethanol intake was later also introduced into long￾term (up to 12 weeks) chronic ethanol-fed mice,93 causing more 
severe steatohepatitis than the 10day chronic-plus-binge ethanol 
feeding model. This long-term chronic-plus-binge ethanol 
feeding induced mild fibrosis whereas the 10day chronic-plus￾binge ethanol model only caused fibrogenic responses without 
significant fibrosis. Moreover, high-fat diet feeding plus binge 
ethanol intake caused severe steatohepatitis with significant 
neutrophil infiltration and mild fibrosis94–97 whereas high-fat diet 
feeding only caused steatosis in mice. This high-fat diet feeding 
plus binge ethanol intake is a very useful model to study the 
synergistic effect of obesity and binge drinking on liver injury. 
Finally, weekly binges were also recently introduced into mice 
that are chronically fed ethanol, high-fat and high cholesterol 
diets via intragastric infusion.98 This complex model shifted 
macrophge infiltration into neutrophil infiltration, causing more 
severe liver inflammation (neutrophil infiltration), injury and 
fibrosis than chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding, representing a 
good model to study moderate AH.98 The limitation to use this 
complex hybrid model includes its technical difficulty, and its 
requirement for intensive medical care and expensive equipment. 99
By using these newly developed models with binge ethanol 
intake, many novel mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced 
steatohepatitis have been recently identified, including neutro￾phils, natural killer T cells, micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), 
autophagy, extracellular vesicles and others.92 The chronic-plus￾binge ethanol feeding model has also been used to examine 
several potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ALD, 
including recombinant interleukin (IL)−22,100 engineered 
bacteria that produce IL-22101 and an IL-1 antagonist.102 Both 
IL-22 and the IL-1 antagonist are currently being evaluated in 
clinical trials as therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients 
with sAH.
Although the chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model and 
hybrid feeding model are useful for the study of ASH, they do 
not generate the full features and complications observed in 
sAH, such as cirrhosis, jaundice, renal failure, bacterial infections 
and others. Due to the fast ethanol metabolism and short-term 
feeding periods, rodents are unlikely to be able to develop severe 
forms of ALD including sAH by consuming alcohol alone. Thus, 
investigators have tried combinations of alcohol feeding and 
other toxins (such as LPS, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4
), 3,5-diet
hoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, concanavalin A and others) 
to induce more severe forms of liver injury.103–106 Moreover, 
chronic CCl4
 administration plus ethanol feeding induced liver 
cancer development in mice,107 which has been used to study 
the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver cancer. However, 
these combination models have not been well accepted as ALD 
models in the field since the majority of phenotypes observed 
in these models are caused by toxins other than alcohol. More￾over, many administration observed in severe ALD were due to 
the secondary effects of severe damage and inflammation and 
were not due to the primary effects of alcohol-induced toxicity; 
thus these combination models are probably still useful to study 
the mechanisms underlying severe ALD and to test therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of severe ALD.
Mechanisms and targets of disease
The pathophysiology of ALD is complex and the key elements 
are related first, to the direct effects of ethanol and its metabo￾lites on the liver and other organs and second, to immune cell 
activation and inflammation triggered by the alcohol’s effects.
The metabolism of high concentrations of alcohol results not 
only in acetaldehyde, that has cellular toxic effects, but also in 
the production of reactive oxygen species that disturb mitochon￾drial energy transport and other intracellular signalling path￾ways.108 In disrupting cellular homeostasis, alcohol was shown 
to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein 
response, mitochondrial, Golgi and lysosomal stress responses 
and injuries.

It has been shown that innate immune system activation 
is a central driver in ALD and particularly in AH where pro￾inflammatory cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production contribute to disease severity as well as to clinical 
symptoms and prognosis. The direct effects of alcohol and its 
metabolites in hepatocytes result in ER stress that induces the 
activation of the stimulator of interferon inducible genes leading 
to phosphorylation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3).109
In addition to being involved in type-1 interferon induction, 
phosphorylated IRF3 interacts with mitochondrial apoptotic 
molecules, thus leading to hepatocyte damage and the release of 
sterile damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as 
uric acid, ATP, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1).110 111
Gut-liver axis in ALD
Alcohol also affects the gut at multiple levels. ALD is associ￾ated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. The importance 
of intestinal dysbiosis for the development of ALD was shown 
by faecal microbiota transfer. Mice transplanted with stool 
from patients with sAH develop more severe liver disease when 
compared with mice transplanted with stool from patients with 
less severe disease following feeding of an oral Lieber‐DeCarli 
diet for 28 days.112 Bacterial overgrowth of the luminal and 
mucosa-associated microbiota in the small intestine occurs in 
patients with early stages of ALD.113 114 Changes in the bacte￾rial taxa are dependent on the stage of liver disease as patients 
with early disease have a different microbiota composition when 
compared with patients with AC or AH.115 Published reports are

Key messages from the round table discussion regarding 
gut-liver axis in ALD
► The gut microbiota contributes to alcohol-relatedliver 
disease (ALD) by different mechanisms such as gut barrier 
dysfunction and changes in microbial metabolites.
► Intestinal dysbiosis is an excellent target for therapy.
not consistent with respect to changes in bacterial taxa, which 
is likely due to different methods that are being applied in each 
study and different countries of patient enrolment.115 116 Devel￾opment of intestinal dysbiosis is not occurring in all patients with 
AUD.117 Taxonomic changes in fungi are largely characterised by 
a decrease in fungal diversity and overgrowth of Candida species 
in patients with AUD and AH. This appears to be mostly inde￾pendent from the stage of liver disease.118 119 Although increased 
intestinal permeability is present in about 50% of patients with 
AUD and early stages of liver disease,117 paracellular tight junc￾tion disruption is more common in cirrhosis and AH.54
Dysbiosis is closely linked to increased intestinal permea￾bility.117 Dysbiosis-induced intestinal immune dysregulation 
connects the gut microbiota and translocation of microbial 
products in preclinical models.120 Alcohol affects intestinal 
permeability by other mechanisms, including disruption of the 
circadian rhythm and a direct effect of the ethanol metabolite 
acetaldehyde on tight junctions.121 In addition, translocation 
of viable bacteria occurs independently from changes in tight 
junctions.114 122 Both, translocation of microbial products such 
as bacterial LPS or fungal β-D-glucan, and of viable bacteria are 
required for the development of ethanol-induced liver disease 
in preclinical models. Microbial translocation contributes to 
hepatic inflammation, hepatocyte injury and fibrosis. In patients 
with AC or AH, bacterial translocation contributes to systemic 
inflammation, decompensation and mortality.54
The intestinal microbiota contributes to ALD not only by 
microbial translocation. Changes in microbial metabolism affect 
the intestinal metabolites, including bile acids,123 124 short-chain 
fatty acids,125–127 saturated long-chain fatty acids,128 indole 
derivatives101 and possibly other molecules. Figure 7 shows the 
contribution of intestinal microbiota to ALD.
Bile acid homeostasis is disrupted in patients with ALD. 
Systemic total bile acids are elevated in 40% of patients with pre￾cirrhotic ALD, while 81% of patients with AC have increased 
serum bile acids.129 Patients with AH have increased total, and 
absolute and proportional conjugated bile acid levels.123 Fibro￾blast growth factor (FGF19) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) 
expression is increased in the terminal ileum of actively drinking 
patients with cirrhosis when compared with patients with 
cirrhosis of non-alcoholic aetiology.
130
Serum FGF19 levels are markedly increased in patients 
with AH, which is partly explained by de novo induction of 
FGF19 mRNA expression in the liver. FGF19 inhibits bile 
acid synthesis, and synthesis of bile acids is hence significantly 
decreased in patients with AH and patients with AUD compared 
with controls.123
There is also evidence that in ALD, the antibacterial potency of 
mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells may be reduced 
as a result of contact with microbial products and microbiota. 
So, it is possible that the 'leaky' gut seen in ALD leads to MAIT 
cell dysfunction, thus increasing susceptibility to infection in 
these patients.131
Immune activation in the liver
Intestinal bacterial overgrowth and changes in the composition of 
the bacterial and fungal microbiota due to chronic alcohol use132
together with inflammation in the intestinal wall and reduced 
expression of tight junction proteins result in an increased gut 
permeability permitting pathogen-associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs) such as LPS and bacterial DNA to enter the portal and 
systemic circulation.108
These PAMPs are sensed by the different pattern recognition 
receptors on cell surfaces or intracellular resulting in activation of 
pro-inflammatory innate immune activation pathways. Different 
Toll-like receptors (TLR) are involved in the recognition of the 
PAMPs and DAMPs leading to the common pro-inflammatory 
pathway of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of

activated B cells activation, chemokines and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, pro-IL-1ß). The 
intracellular inflammasome complex, particularly nucleotide￾binding oligomerisation domain-like receptor P3, activated by 
uric acid and ATP, lead to caspase-1 activation that results in the 
secretion of bioactive IL-1ß.102 108
This provides an amplification loop for increasing pro￾inflammatory cytokine production with additional effects on 
the liver promoting hepatocyte damage, fibrosis and inhibiting 
regeneration.133 These pathways are activated primarily in 
recruited macrophages and activated Kupffer cells in the liver. In 
addition, there is a major recruitment of neutrophil leukocytes 
to the liver in AH.
Based on animal models, neutrophils show an in vivo activated 
phenotype after chronic alcohol exposure but cannot properly 
respond to new stimulation.134
Preclinical studies indicate that strategies that interrupt 
inflammatory cascade activation may have benefits in ALD and 
AH.
Future therapeutic targets for the treatment of ALD
In recent years advances in the understanding of the molec￾ular mechanisms of ALD have yielded the identification of new 
therapeutic targets in the treatment of ALD. Several encour￾aging pilot studies have led to larger clinical trials testing 
new pathophysiologically-oriented approaches. The focus of 
emerging therapeutics in preclinical testing is on targeting 
inflammation, gut permeability and dysbiosis and on hepatopro￾tective agents.
Preclinical studies indicate that strategies which interrupt 
inflammatory cascade activation may have benefits in ALD and 
AH. For example, inhibition of the IL-1 pathway with admin￾istration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra attenuated 
alcohol-induced steatosis, liver damage, inflammation and early 
fibrosis in mice.102 133 Anakinra and the IL-1β specific mono￾clonal antibody, canakinumab, are now being evaluated in clin￾ical trials in the UK and USA.
Although mice do not replicate all of the typical features of 
ALD including steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, the inflam￾matory components were eliminated in mice after adminis￾tration of a small molecular inhibitor of CCR2 and CCR5, 
cenicriviroc.135
Another potential target is spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Damp￾ening TLR-mediated pathways by inhibition of Syk was proven 
to reduce steatosis liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis in 
a mouse model of ALD.136 This has not been tested in humans 
yet. Targeting TLR 7/8 improves host anti-infective response in 
AC.137 138
Apoptosis signal regulating protein 1 (ASK-1) is a member of 
the mitogen activated protein kinase family of signal transduc￾ters. It activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 map kinase in 
response to oxidative stress or ER stress. A recent phase 2 trial 
(NCT02854631) evaluated the efficacy of selonsertib, a novel 
inhibitor of ASK-1 in patients with severe AH. Unfortunately, 
the results of this study were negative.
Increasing evidence suggest a role for miRNAs and extracel￾lular vesicles in the pathomechanisms of ALD.54 136 139 Chronic 
alcohol was shown to reduce liver and hepatocyte expression of 
miRNA-122, the most abundant microRNA essential for hepato￾cyte functions. Replacement of miR-122 in hepatocytes in vivo 
alleviated alcohol-induced liver injury, steatosis and fibrosis.139
The inflammation-related miRNA-155 is increased by alcohol in 
immune cells and miR-155 deficient mice were protected from 
features of ALD suggesting miR-155 as another potential thera￾peutic target.140
Another approach is the inhibition of CYP2E1 to decrease 
oxidative stress and the generation of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) that contributes to inflammation.141
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been 
shown to increase hepatocyte proliferation and to increase the 
number of circulating CD34 positive cells. Initial trials from 
India suggest a potential benefit for the treatment of patients 
with AH.142–144 It remains to be determined whether the effect 
of G-CSF in AH is related to its effects on neutrophil leukocytes 
or linked to recruitment of bone marrow-derived steam cells in 
the circulation and the liver.
Hepatoprotective agents also can provide benefits in ALD, 
protecting against cell damage and improving liver regeneration. 
As previously mentioned, one example is cytokine IL-22 which 
is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of AH.145
Another excellent target for therapy is intestinal dysbiosis. As 
referred above, transfer of human microbiomes from patients 
with ALD or healthy controls impacts the susceptibility of mice 
models to AH. As proof of principle, small clinical trials using 
faecal microbiota transfer have shown benefit in mortality for 
patients with sAH not eligible for treatment with steroids146 and 
in improving hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decom￾pensated AC.147 Other more targeted approaches might include 
restoring intestinal eubiosis using prebiotics, probiotics, synbi￾otics or antibiotics; restoring the function of altered microbial 
metabolism using bio-engineered bacteria or supplementing 
metabolites or altering host metabolism that is disrupted during 
dysbiosis.115 Moreover, precisely editing the instestinal micro￾biota with bacteriophages may also represent a promising ther￾apeutic approach. This has been recently demonstrated using 
bacteriophages that specifically target Enterococcus faecalis, 
a bacterium that accumulates in the gut of patients with AH 
and that releases a hepatotoxic exotoxin. Administration of E. 
faecalis-specific bacteriophages abolished ethanol-induced liver 
injury in humanised mice.148
Finally, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-bile acid axis/FXR 
agonists may be a promising therapeutic target for ALD.124 In 
mouse models of liver disease FXR agonists have been shown to 
improve intestinal mucosal integrity leading to reduced micro￾bial translocation and also to reduced hepatic stellate cell activa￾tion which might result in lowering of portal pressure.149
To date this therapeutic target has not been evaluated in 
humans with AH. More studies are needed to further examine 
the different approaches in alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and 
steatosis.
New targeted therapies from clinical trials might be available 
within the next 5 to 10 years.
Figure 8 is summarising the future therapeutic targets 
discussed.
Public health policies on alcohol consumption and the 
influence of industry
The root of ALD is obviously harmful alcohol use. A number 
of stakeholders seek to influence alcohol policy discourse. 
There is a major need to examine in detail the role of all these 
parties, especially non-governmental organisations. The term 
non-governmental organisation can be confusing as it has, for 
example, been used by the United Nations to include business 
interests.150

Key messages from the round table discussion regarding 
new therapeutic targets
► More studies are needed to further examine the different 
approaches in alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and steatosis.
► Despite new therapy developments, it is also possible to 
optimise the use of existing therapies. Important are the right 
patient selection and to avoid infection. Also the treatment of 
alcohol use disorders shouldn’t be forgotten.
lobbyists and so-called independent charities funded by alcohol 
industry. These sit alongside independent public health bodies, 
and it is in the industry’s interest to blur the distinctions. There 
are finally arms-length bodies where the influence and control 
by governments may be difficult to assess.
It is essential to consider all types of actors and scrutinise 
their potential for conflicts of interest to arise and distort public 
health policies. The potential conflicts arise also in areas such as 
the dissemination of public health messaging and the funding of 
research.
The most overt and egregious examples of untoward influ￾ence in developing alcohol policy occur in the developing 
countries — for example in Africa where it is documented that 
global producers supported countries in developing their alcohol 
policies.151
Within western countries there are many examples of subtle 
influence through so called corporate social responsibility — 
examples include:
► Covert access of global companies to government 
decision-makers.152
► The ability of global producers to capture organisations like 
international football tournaments.153
► The use of ‘front organisations’ like the International Centre 
for Alcohol Policy, the more recent International Alliance for 
Responsible Drinking and the European Policy Centre.154
► The commissioning of non-peer reviewed reports such as 
that produced by the Institute of Economic Affairs to coun￾teract minimum unit price.155
► Voluntary partnerships with industry like the Responsibility 
Deal Alcohol Network in the UK and the European Commis￾sion’s European Alcohol and Health Forum.
There are also organisations in unclear positions, often at the 
behest of governments to offload their financial responsibility, 
for example Drinkaware in the UK. These are funded by volun￾tary donations from industry but may be registered as charities. 
They do not overtly push industry agendas but tend to support 
less effective harm-reduction policies, such as education and 
can lack transparency in their declaration of interests. Also, 
and very importantly, the perception that the funding is coming 
from industry and hence ‘tainted’ discourages independent 
researchers from applying for grants while giving other research 
bodies an excuse not to fund the area. Governments must bear

large responsibility for situations like this — they allow industry 
actors to ‘help’ and give prominence to views of those where 
there is a clear conflict of interest in the name of ‘balance’. If 
we worked in an environment of complete transparency, these 
conflicts might be manageable, but this is not practical in the real 
world. The trail of inappropriate influence is long and complex 
and is supported by resources that the truly independent chari￾ties and public health organisations can never match. It is only 
through vigilance that their impact can be minimised.
Global strategies on alcohol consumption and related harm
Health services and health professionals play an important role 
in reducing the harmful use of alcohol not only at individual, 
but also at population level by promoting effective public health 
measures. In 2010 the World Health Assembly endorsed the 
Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol that is the 
only global policy framework for alcohol control.156 The strategy 
defines the harmful use of alcohol as the drinking that causes 
detrimental health and social consequences for the drinker, 
the people around the drinker and society at large, as well as 
the patterns of drinking that are associated with increased risk 
of adverse health outcomes. This translates into the following 
diagnostic categories of the 11th revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-11)157: episode of harmful use 
of alcohol (6C40.0), harmful pattern of use of alcohol (6C40.1), 
alcohol dependence (6C40.2) as well as hazardous alcohol use 
(QE10). The ICD-11 includes several diagnostic categories 
under the umbrella term ‘alcoholic liver disease’ (DB94) that 
has some negative connotations in its name and can be in future 
renamed as ‘alcohol-related liver disease’.
In the UN Political Declaration on prevention and control 
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2011158 and in the 
WHO Global NCD Action Plan 2013–2020159 the harmful use 
of alcohol is included as one of the key risk factors for major 
NCDs. In the context of defining the most cost-effective inter￾ventions for reducing the harmful use of alcohol, the WHO 
recommends (a) increase excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, (b) 
enact and enforce bans or comprehensive restrictions on expo￾sure to alcohol advertising (across multiple types of media), (c) 
enact and enforce restrictions on physical availability of retailed 
alcohol (via reduced hours of sale), (d) enact and enforce drink￾driving laws and blood alcohol concentration limits via sobriety 
checkpoints, (e) provide brief psychosocial interventions for 
persons with hazardous and harmful alcohol use.160
As alcohol consumption is causally linked to numerous health 
conditions1 14 and in all cases of liver disease, health profes￾sionals should be attentive to drinking patterns in their patients, 
using whenever possible the available screening instruments, and 
provide brief intervention for hazardous and harmful drinking. 
If alcohol dependence is diagnosed, treatment interventions 
may include pharmacological and psychosocial interventions or 
their combination and/or referral to treatment programmes for 
AUD.161 For pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence 
three medications are recommended (disulfiram, naltrexone 
and acamprosate), and several other medications (including 
nalmefene, baclofen, gabapentin, topiramate) are being 
explored for treatment of AUDs in clinical trials with so far 
inconsistent results.162 163 Effective psychosocial interventions 
include cognitive-behavioural therapy, motivational enhance￾ment therapy, family therapy, 12-step facilitation, mutual help 
groups.161 162
Acknowledging the important role of effective treatment 
options for AUDs and other prevention interventions and 
treatment interventions delivered by health services, the 
most effective strategies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol 
at population level are strongly linked to population-based
measures. In 2018 the WHO launched a new ‘SAFER’ initia￾tive to boost the implementation of the global strategy to 
reduce the harmful use of alcohol and support the imple￾mentation of high-impact and cost-effective interventions at
country level.164
A systemic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2016 found the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifi￾cally rises with increasing levels of alcohol consumption, and the 
level of alcohol consumption that minimises health loss is zero. 
These results suggest that alcohol control policies might need 
to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall 
population-level consumption.33
Conclusion
The round table panel discussed a broad variety of important 
and timely aspects regarding the topic of ALD in the areas of 
epidemiology, diagnosis, management, pathomechanisms and 
future therapeutic targets, as well as industry’s influence and 
global public health strategy on alcohol consumption and related 
harm.
The panel agreed that the commonly used name alcoholic 
liver disease is stigmatised and should change to alcohol-related 
liver disease.
The panel recognised the accumulating evidence indicating 
that any level of alcohol consumption, regardless the type of 
beverage, represents a health risk.
Experimental models of ALD have been refined over the 
past years. Although some of these models are useful to inves￾tigate mechanisms and targets in early disease stages, they do 
not reproduce the more salient features of advanced ALD. The 
panel concluded that the lack of relevant models in this area is 
an important limitation and that more efforts should be made in 
this direction.
The panel concluded that more research regarding associated 
risk factors for the development and progression of ALD, and 
on how both short-term and long-term fluctuations in drinking 
influence the risk of liver damage should be conducted.
Efforts should be undertaken to find a biomarker as a proxy 
measure for alcohol use for clinical and research purposes. The 
panel found that healthcare professionals should focus more on 
the diagnosis of non-severe AH.
The optimal therapeutic strategy in patients with sAH and 
ACLF needs further investigation.
More studies are needed to identify novel targets for treat￾ment and to further examine the different new therapeutic 
approaches.
Hepatologists should get better training in the identification 
and management of AUDs and referral and cooperation with 
addiction specialists needs to be improved.
Finally, in the area of public health, governments and related 
bodies need clearer definitions and terms of engagement 
with industry actors. Also, minimum pricing and taxation are 
important in reducing the harmful use of alcohol.

Key messages from the round table discussion with 
regards to global policies on alcohol consumption:
► The name alcoholic liver disease is stigmatising and should 
change to alcohol-related liver disease.
► Pricing policies and taxation are important as well as other 
population-based measures shown to be effective in reducing 
the harmful use of alcohol and summarised in the WHO-led 
SAFER initiative.
► Referral and cooperation with addiction specialists needs to 
be improved.
► Hepatologists should have improved training in identification 
and management of hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use
