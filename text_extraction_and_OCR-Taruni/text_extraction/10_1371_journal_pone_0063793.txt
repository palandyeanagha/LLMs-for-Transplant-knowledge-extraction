Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis in developing nations and occurs in
sporadic and epidemic forms. The disease may become severe with high mortality (20%) among pregnant women. Due to
lack of efficient cell culture system and small animal model, early molecular events of HEV infection are not yet known. In
the present study, human lung epithelial cells, A549, were infected with HEV to monitor expression levels of genes/proteins
in antiviral pathways. Both live and UV inactivated virus elicited robust induction of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines
such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and RANTES within 12 h of infection. Cells exposed to soluble capsid protein showed no induction
suggesting the capsid structure and not the protein being detected as the pathogen pattern by cells. A delayed up￾regulation of type I interferon genes only by the live virus at 48 h post HEV infection indicated the need of virus replication.
However, absence of secreted interferons till 96 h suggested possible involvement of post-transcriptional regulation of type
I IFN expression. HEV infected cells showed activation of both NF-kB and IRF3 transcription factors when seen at protein
levels; however, reporter gene assays showed predominant expression via NF-kB promoter as compared to IRF3 promoter.
Knockdown experiments done using siRNAs showed involvement of MyD88 and TRIF adaptors in generating antiviral
response thus indicating role of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR3 in sensing viral molecules. MAVS knockdown surprisingly enhanced
only proinflammatory cytokines and not type I IFNs. This suggested that HEV not only down-regulates RIG-I helicase like
receptor mediated IFN induction but also employs MAVS in curtailing host inflammatory response. Our findings uncover an
early cellular response in HEV infection and associated molecular mechanisms suggesting the potential role of inflammatory
response triggered by HEV infection in host immune response and pathogenesis.

Introduction
Innate immune system represents the first line of defense against
invading pathogens in the hosts. Specific structures such as
structural components and replication intermediates of the
invading pathogens are recognized by pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) in the host cells resulting in production of type
I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines to
eradicate the pathogen from the cells. This also helps in priming
the antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Two families of PRRs,
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I like
receptors (RLRs) act as sensors of viral infections. TLRs sense the
pathogen components on the cells surface and endosomal
compartments. In contrast, RLRs survey the cytoplasm for the
presence of viral double-stranded RNA (a replication intermediate)
and 59-triphosphate group containing single stranded RNA
molecules [1–6]. Type I IFNs initiate expression of numerous
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in an autocrine or paracrine manner
to induce antiviral state in the infected and neighboring cells [6].
Viruses employ different strategies to evade innate immune
responses in the host cell for productive infection [6–7].
Hepatitis E is largely an acute and self-limiting disease caused
by enteric transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV). Severe
manifestation of hepatitis E is more common in pregnant women
with high mortality rates (20%). Persistent HEV infections have
been recently documented in immunosuppressed patients [8].
Hepatitis E virus is a non-enveloped, single stranded, positive
sense RNA virus of size 27–34 nm belonging to Hepevirus genus of
the family Hepeviridae. HEV genome is ,7.2 kb long with short 59-
and 39- noncoding regions (NCRs), a 59- methylguanine cap, a 39-
poly (A) stretch and three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2 and
ORF3) [9]. ORF1 encodes for nonstructural polyprotein involved
in viral replication while ORF2 encodes for capsid protein
containing, three glycosylation sites [10] and immunodominant
epitopes. ORF3 encodes cytoskeleton-associated phosphoprotein
[11]. ORF2 and ORF3 overlap with each other and are proposed
to be translated from a single, bicistronic mRNA. ORF2 and
ORF3 proteins interact with many cellular proteins possibly
helping establish HEV infection [12].
It is suggested that hepatic damage in hepatitis E patients is
immune mediated and not by the direct replication of the virus
[8]; however, the exact mechanism of liver damage is not yet
known. Analysis of patients with acute hepatitis E has shown
altered frequencies of NK cell subtypes suggesting probable
involvement of innate immunity [13]. A microarray study of
comparative pathogenesis of HEV and HCV in Chimpanzees has
shown attenuated expression of innate response genes in HEV
infection as compared to HCV [14]. Studies from our laboratory
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63793

have shown low levels of IFN-a and comparatively higher levels of
inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF￾a in acute phase hepatitis E patients [15–16].
HEV remains a difficult virus to study in vitro. There is a recent
report on the propagation of genotype 3 and 4 HEV in liver and
lung epithelial cells [17]. Expression patterns of genes that initiate
signaling pathways leading to the induction of protective cellular
genes during initial phases of HEV infection are not yet known. It
was recently demonstrated that HEV inhibits IFN-a signaling and
manages to replicate in the presence of IFN-a [18]. However, it is
not yet known whether HEV is able to alter IFN induction in the
host cells. In the present study we infected lung epithelial cells,
A549, with HEV and analyzed the induced antiviral response.
Materials and Methods
Ethical Statement
National Institute of Virology, Pune, is the nodal organization
in India for investigating suspected viral outbreaks. During
epidemic investigations, no ethical clearance is required. For
hepatitis outbreaks, the investigating team collects blood and stool
samples from the cases for serological diagnosis and PCR based
virus detection respectively. Since hepatitis E and hepatitis A have
faeco-oral route of transmission water samples are also collected
from drinking water sources for virus detection. As the stool
samples used in the current study were collected during an
epidemic it was not necessary to obtain informed consent of the
patients.
Virus stock preparation
HEV RNA positive (genotype 1, GenBank accession no.
DQ459342.1) stool sample collected from a confirmed hepatitis
E case (anti-HEV IgM positive) was used to prepare 10% stool
suspension and centrifuged at 10000 g at 4uC for 10 min.
Supernatant was filtered through 0.22 mm filter and stored at
280uC until further use. Virus purification was carried out by
sucrose step gradient centrifugation as described previously [19]
and HEV RNA copy number was determined using TaqMan real￾time PCR assay [20]. LPS contents of the purified virus stock were
checked using LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit
(Pierce). UV inactivation of HEV was carried out as described
previously [21]. Influenza A virus (Perth H3N2, NIV SF-33041)
stock propagated in embryonated chicken eggs (32 haemagglutinin
units/ml) was aliquoted and stored at 280uC until further use.
Cells and virus infection
Cell lines were either obtained from ATCC (USA) or JCRB
(Japan). S10-3 cells were a kind gift from Dr. S. Emerson (NIH,
USA) [19,22]. Hepatoma cells (PLC/PRF5, Huh7, and HepG2),
subclonal hepatoma cells (S10-3, and HepG2/C3A) and non￾hepatoma cells (Caco2, human colon carcinoma and A549,
human lung carcinoma) were infected with HEV with 1:1 ratio of
cells: HEV RNA genome equivalents and harvested at different
time intervals. Based upon the results obtained from screening of
these cell lines all further work was carried out using A549 cells,
propagated in F12-K medium (Invitrogen, Life technologies,
USA), supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and
streptomycin (100 mg/ml) at 37uC and 5% CO2. Day before
infection, cells were either seeded in 6 well (26105 cells/well) or 12
well (16105 cells/well) culture plates to achieve 50–60% con￾fluency. Cell monolayer was first washed with serum free medium,
OptiMEM (Invitrogen, Life technologies) and then infected with
the virus, appropriately diluted in the same medium, for 2 h at
34.5uC. After adsorption of the virus, inoculum was removed and
cell layer was washed five times and maintained in F12-K medium
with 10% FBS. Influenza virus infection was also carried out
similarly.
Detection of HEV replicative intermediate RNA and
proteins: Negative strand specific RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells using Ribopure
RNA extraction kit (Ambion, Life technologies, USA) and
detection of negative sense RNA (nsRNA) (replicative intermedi￾ate) was done as described previously using tagged primer-based
reverse-transcription PCR [23].
Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
Cells were trypsinized 24 h before the stipulated time point and
plated in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Thermo scientific). Next
day, cells were fixed with acetone for 30 min, and incubated with
anti-HEV mAb (generated against partial ORF2 protein, 458–607
amino acids) at RT for 30 min. After three washes with PBS
containing 0.1% Tween-20, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min
at RT, washed and viewed on FLoidTM Cell Imaging Station (Life
technologies, CA, USA).
Detection of pORF2 binding to cells by
Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
For cell imaging studies, A549 cells were grown on LabTek
chamber slides for 24 h and the purified recombinant ORF2
protein [24] was added on the cells (10 mg/ml). Binding was
carried out for 1 h at room temperature, following which cells
were washed extensively with PBS and fixed with 4% formalde￾hyde. Staining was done as described above for immunofluores￾cence assay. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were detached from
culture dishes and pelleted at 4006g for 5 min. Cell pellets (16106
cells) were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA (wash buffer).
Cells were incubated with 10 mg/ml of pORF2 for 1 h at RT,
washed and stained to detect ORF2 protein bound to the cell
surface as described above. Control cells were also stained with
primary and secondary antibodies without prior pORF2 binding.
Acquisition was done on FACS Aria flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Ten thousand events per sample were collected and
retrieved data was analyzed using the FACSDiva software (v.5.2.2,
BD Biosciences).
Stimulation of the cells with poly (I:C)
Cells were transfected with poly (I:C)/LyoVec complex (poly
I:C with transfection reagent) (InvivoGen) as per the manufactur￾er’s instructions.
Gene Expression profiling by TaqMan Low Density Array
(TLDA)
Antiviral genes (n = 95) and 18 s rRNA as endogenous control
were chosen for the study and the array cards were procured from
Applied Biosystems (USA) (Table S1). Total cellular RNA
extracted using Ribopure RNA extraction kit (Ambion) was
checked for integrity and quantified (ND-1000, Nanodrop
Technologies). cDNA was prepared using High-Capacity cDNA
Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). After ensuring efficient
cDNA synthesis, 125 ng (RNA equivalent) of the cDNA was
loaded in each port of the TLDA card and run on 7900 HT
system (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification was done
using RQ Manager Software.

Quantitative PCR and ELISAs for interferons, cytokines
and chemokines: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Verification of the TLDA data was done using individual SYBR
green-based quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays for
selective genes. The cDNAs prepared using the above method
were analyzed on 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, USA). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene to
normalize the RNA input. RNA from mock infected cells was used
as the calibrator and relative gene expression analysis was carried
out using SDS2.2 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). Primers
used for the quantitative analysis are enlisted in (Table S2).
ELISAs
Cell culture supernatants from the experimental cells were
assessed for the interferon, cytokine and chemokine levels as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. The kits used were IFN-a/b (PBL,
Piscataway, NJ), IL-6 (Detection limit 10–2000 pg/ml), RANTES
(31.2–2000 pg/ml) (Invitrogen), TNF-a (2–250 pg/ml) (IMGE￾NEX) and IL-8 (31.2–2000 pg/ml) (R & D Systems, USA).
Luciferase assay
A549 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and co-transfected
24 h later with 500 ng of pNF-kB -Luc (firefly luciferase)
(Stratagene) or pIFN-b-Luc and 5 ng of pGL4.75 hRluc/CMV
(Renilla luciferase) (Promega) plasmid DNA by using Xfect
transfection reagent (Clontech). After 24 h cells were infected
with either HEV or UV inactivated HEV (HEV-UV), influenza A
virus or left without infection. Cell lysates were assayed using Dual
Reporter Assay kit (Promega) on Perkin Elmer 2030 Reader
(Victor 63). Firefly luciferase values were normalized with Renilla
luciferase values to normalize transfection efficiencies. Luciferase
values obtained from the uninfected cells were subtracted from
experimental samples to normalize DNA mediated background
expression.
Type I IFN sensor assay
Stimulation of HEK-BlueTMIFN-a/b cells (InvivoGen, San
Diego, CA) cells with human IFN-a/b activates JAK/STAT/
ISGF3 pathway to induce secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)
which can be quantitated with QUANTI-Blue reagent (Invivo￾Gen, San Diego, CA). Virus infected cell culture supernatants
were used to stimulate HEK Blue cells for 18–20 h and assayed as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. A standard curve generated
with human recombinant IFN-a (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was used
to determine IFN levels in the cell supernatants.
siRNA assays
The siRNAs targeting human TICAM-1/TRIF (148022),
MyD88 (4615) and non-targeting control were obtained from
Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Human MAVS
siRNA (sc-75755) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc (USA). A549 cells were transfected either with control
(100 nM) or other siRNAs using HiPerFect transfection reagent
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 24 h later infected with the virus.
The supernatants were then assayed for cytokine/chemokine
levels.
Immunoblotting
The primary antibodies used were - mAbs mouse NF-kB (p65),
anti-nucleolin, anti-IkBa, (Invitrogen), anti-phospho-IkBa (Ser32),
anti-MyD88, anti-TRIF polyclonal antibodies, mAb anti-phospho
IRF3 (Ser396) (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA), anti-IRF3,
anti-actin(Sigma) and anti-MAVS (ProSci Incorporated, CA,
USA). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer
(25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM
EDTA, 1 mM PMSF). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were
prepared using NE-PER kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Equal
amounts of protein extracts (20 mg) were analyzed on 10% SDS￾PAGE and blots were developed with Amersham ECL Western
blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ)
followed by exposure to X-ray films. For re-probing, membrane
was incubated in western blotting stripping buffer (Thermo
Scientific) for 15 min at RT and processed for staining.
Densitometric scanning
Western blot images were scanned on AlphaImager 3400 gel
imaging system and densitometric analysis was performed on
unsaturated blots by using Alpha Innotech FC software. Relative
densitometric value (RDV) for each experimental band was
calculated by normalizing the absolute intensity of experimental
band with respect to that of the control (actin/nucleolin) bands.
Statistical analyses
All experiments were performed at least three times. Data is
presented as mean 6 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis
was performed on ELISA results using GraphPad Prism software
and p-values,0.05 were considered as significant.

Results
Selection of cell culture model
HEV RNA copies of the purified viral stock were determined to
be 1.46106 copies/ml. LPS contents of the viral inoculum was
0.8 EU/ml (,1 EU/ml).The stock was diluted appropriately as
needed for the infection. While number of cell lines have been
shown to support HEV replication, it was essential to use an
appropriate model to analyze the interactions between HEV and
signaling pathways in the host. HEV does not show cytopathic
effect and in absence of robust replication any negligible increase
in copy number would not be considered significant by
quantitative real time PCR. Under these circumstances, replica￾tion can be demonstrated by showing presence of negative strand
RNA (replicative intermediate) and newly formed ORF2 protein.
To optimize parameters used for monitoring successful virus
replication different cells were infected with HEV and analyzed by
negative strand RNA detection assay and IFA at different time
intervals up to 12 days post infection (p.i.). Considering our
previous observations that-i) negative sense RNA is encapsidated
along with positive sense genome in hepatitis E virions, ii) negative
sense RNA detection could be false positive if reaction contains
$106 copies of positive sense RNA [23]; we decided to use 105
genome equivalent copies of the virus/well for cell infections in the
present study. All the infected cells were processed for negative
strand detection at T0 (zero hour time point) and the results were
always negative. Hence, infected samples would be positive for
negative strand only if virus replicates. All examined cell lines
supported HEV replication as indicated by negative sense RNA
positivity. HepG2, Caco2, PLC/PRF5, Huh7 and S10-3 cells
were positive for negative sense RNA from 96 h post infection
while A549 and HepG2/C3A cells were positive from 8 h post
infection.
All tested cells were positive from 6–8 days post HEV infection
when newly synthesized ORF2 protein was detected by immuno￾fluorescence assay (IFA). With previous reports that the trans￾formed hepatoma cells have impaired double stranded RNA and
virus-activated IFN responses [25–26], HepG2/C3A and A549
cells, which showed negative sense RNA at early time points were
stimulated with poly (I:C) (1–5 mg/ml) to check for their response.
A549 cells secreted IFN-b after 8 h (117.5 pg/ml) and levels
increased up to 2105 pg/ml at 48 h with 1 mg/ml poly (I:C). Poly
(I:C) concentrations above 2 mg/ml induced apoptosis within 24 h
of exposure. HepG2/C3A cells did not show IFN-b secretion nor
cell death with any of the tested poly (I:C) concentrations (data not
shown). Considering the response to poly (I:C) and permissiveness
for HEV infection (Figure 1A, 1B) A549 cells were used for further
experiments. At 6 days p.i., these cells showed 15–20% IFA
positivity indicating successful infection. UV exposure of the virus
for 30 min resulted in complete inactivation as the cells infected
with this virus remained negative for both HEV negative sense
RNA and IFA up to 12 days.
Gene expression profile in HEV infection
To monitor the expression levels of different genes in response
to virus infection, A549 cells were infected with either HEV or
HEV-UV or influenza A virus (known to activate antiviral
pathways in A549 cells) [27–29]. Results obtained with low
density arrays showed differentially expressed genes which are
functionally categorized below (Table 1). Expression of selective
cytokine/chemokine genes was validated with the SYBR green
real-time PCR quantitative assays (Fig. S1).
Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)
Transcription of cytosolic receptor, RIG-I/DDX58 was initially
low (2.1 folds at 12 h) and increased subsequently as virus
replication proceeds from 48 to 72 h post HEV infection (4.3–21
folds). There was only a transient increase of MDA-5/IFIH1
expression at 48 h (5.9 folds). Expression of RIG-I and MDA5

remained unchanged with HEV-UV. Cell surface TLRs such as
TLR2 and TLR4 were also up-regulated only in live HEV
infected cells. Expression of TLR3, which recognizes double
stranded RNA (dsRNA) remained unchanged in HEV and HEV￾UV infected cells. Influenza virus induced RIG-I (13 folds), MDA￾5 (31 folds) and TLR3 (7.3 folds) at 12 h post infection (Table 1).
Due to impaired TLR7 and TLR8 genes in A549 cells their levels
could not be analyzed [30].
Inflammatory Cytokine/chemokine Genes
CCL20 was up-regulated at all time points in HEV infected
cells. HEV-UV infection also induced CCL20 to lower levels
(Table 1). CCL5/RANTES expression levels were significantly
higher with both live (2.5–10 folds) and HEV-UV (10–20 folds) at
24 h (Fig. S1). Other significantly up-regulated genes in HEV
infected cells were IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, TNF family member LTA
and TNFSF10/TRAIL. Except LTA there was low level up￾regulation of these genes also with HEV-UV infection (Table 1).
Type I Interferons
IFN-a showed a low level of up-regulation from 12 h onwards
post HEV infection. Levels of IFN-b were initially low (,6 folds)
but increased significantly at 72 h (221 folds). HEV infected cells
showed upregulation of IFN-v (5–13 folds) during 12–96 h
(Table 1). Importantly, IFN induction required live HEV infection
as none of the type I IFN genes were up-regulated with HEV-UV.
This showed that although HEV managed to keep transcription of
type I IFN genes at low levels in the early phases of infection, levels
increased significantly after 48 h. In tune with type I IFN gene up￾regulation, interferon stimulated genes such as IRF1, IRF7, IRF9,
ISG15, MX1, OAS1, GBP1, GBP2, IFIT1, IFIT2 and PKR
showed delayed induction at 48 h post HEV infection (Table 1,
Table S3).
Other genes
IRAK 2 (Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2), known to
play crucial role in TLR signaling pathway and activation of NF￾kB, was significantly induced only in live HEV infected cells (3–11
folds). TNFAIP3/A20, a negative regulator of NF-kB signaling
was also induced only in live HEV infected cells (Table 1).
Detection of secreted type I interferons
There was no measurable secretion of IFN-a and IFN-b until
96 h in culture supernatants of the cells infected with either HEV
or HEV-UV (data not shown). Considering the fact that ELISA
assay has lower sensitivity (detection range 25 to 2000 pg/ml),
another sensitive IFN a/b assay (detection range 12.5 to 500 pg/
ml) with HEK Blue cells was used however, the results remained
negative. As mRNAs are eventually translated into proteins,
detectable levels of IFN-b were expected to be secreted 72 h
onwards in the HEV infected cell supernatants. However there
was no correlation between the levels of mRNA and protein
during IFN synthesis. Supernatants tested from the cells stimulated
with poly (I:C) RNA or infected with influenza A virus showed
secretion of IFNs from 24 h onwards (Figure 2A).

Significantly higher levels of IL-6 (108–400 pg/ml) (Figure 2B),
IL-8 (1.7–11 ng/ml) (Figure 2C) and RANTES (258–420 pg/ml)
(Figure 2D) were detected from 12–96 h p.i. in cells infected with
HEV and HEV-UV. Low level TNF-a secretion (2.5–5.5 pg/ml)
was detected from 12–48 h p.i. with HEV and at 96 h with HEV￾UV (Figure 2E). Comparable induction of proinflammatory
cytokines/chemokines with HEV and HEV-UV prompted us to
explore the capability of capsid (ORF2) protein alone in inducing
pathways leading to cytokine synthesis. For that, purified
recombinant HEV ORF2/capsid protein (glycosylated form,
expressed in baculovirus system) [24] was allowed to bind to
A549 cells and cells were analysed to detect cell bound ORF2
protein. Flow cytometry and IFA analysis of these cells showed 8–
10% positivity (Figure 2F and 2G). Cells incubated with various
concentrations (1–5 mg/ml) of ORF2 for 2 h did not induce
cytokines/chemokines (data not shown). 12 h onwards, the
positive control, influenza A virus showed significantly higher
levels of all four cytokines/chemokines (Fig. S2).
Activation of IRF3 and NF-kB
As an immediate response to virus infection, induced innate
immune pathways typically converge and activate transcription
factors such as NF-kB and IRF3. Activated factors are then
transported into the nucleus where they induce IFN and
inflammatory cytokine genes. Normally, IRF3 stays in the
cytoplasm as an inactive protein but upon phosphorylation forms
complex with CREB binding protein (CBP) and gets translocated
to the nucleus where it induces IFN gene transcription. Analysis of
total cell lysate from HEV infected cells showed increased intensity
of the phosphorylated IRF3 protein band from 3–72 h post HEV
infection. Phosphorylation of IRF3 remained at the basal level in
HEV-UV infected cells (Figure 3A).
NF-kB is a heterodimeric (p65/p50) transcription factor,
normally sequestered within the cytoplasm as a latent complex
by IkBa. Stimulus-induced phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NF￾kB at Ser536 followed by nuclear translocation is critical for DNA
binding of NF-kB p65/p50. In HEV infected cells, nuclear
accumulation of p65 was evident from 24–72 h p.i. (Figure 3B,
upper panel) which was corroborated well with the decrease in the
cytoplasmic p65 at respective time points (Figure 3B lower panel).
As shown in Fig. 3C, level of nuclear p65 remained same in both
mock infected and cells infected with UV inactivated virus.
Treatment of cells with TNFa (20 ng/ml) showed increased
translocation of p65 at 1 h and 2 h. HEV induced IkBaSer32
phosphorylation followed by its simultaneous; time dependent
degradation (Figure 3D–E) confirmed the involvement of NF-kB
pathway in HEV infection. Phosphorylation of IkBa was barely
detectable in the cells infected with UV inactivated virus at 12 h
(Figure 3F) though minimal level of IkBa degradation was evident
at 24 and 48 h. p.i. as compared to mock infected cells (Figure 3G)
infected with either live or UV inactivated HEV and culture supernatants were tested at indicated time points using ELISA assays- IL-6 (B), IL-8 (C),
RANTES (D) and TNF-a (E). Mock represents cell culture supernatant from non-infected cells (12 h time point) processed for respective ELISAs. Data

Antiviral Response in HEV
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63793

Taken together, this data suggested activation of both IRF3 and
NF-kB transcription factors in HEV infected cells.
IFN-b and NF-kB promoter activities
As detected by the luciferase reporter assays IFN-b promoter
though initially (12–24 h) inactive showed activation (14–16 folds)
from 48–96 h p.i. (Figure 3H). However, IFN-b promoter
remained completely inactive with the HEV-UV (data not shown).
The NF-kB promoter activation was observed 12 h onwards in
both live and HEV-UV infected cells (17–20 fold induction)
(Figure 3H).
Signaling adaptors
TLR signaling is roughly divided into two distinct pathways
based on the usage of either MyD88 or TRIF adaptor molecules.
On the other hand, RLRs interact with the N-terminal caspase
activation and recruitment domain-containing adaptor: MAVS.
To identify the adaptors responsible for inducing antiviral
response in HEV infected A549 cells, we used siRNAs to target
TRIF, MyD88 and MAVS encoding mRNAs. Cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blot. As shown in the Figures 4A, 5A, and
6A, adaptor protein levels were significantly reduced (60%, 35%
and 30% respectively) at 48 h when compared to mock transfected
cells indicating successful reduction of respective proteins.
Cells with MyD88 suppression showed significant reduction
(50%) in the levels of secreted IL-6 in HEV infected cells at 24 h
when compared to control siRNA (p = 0.01) (Figure 4B). There
was no effect of TRIF knockdown on IL-6 levels. This clearly
indicated involvement of TLR2 and/or TLR4 in recognizing the
viral capsids as a pathogen signal and inducing key inflammatory
cytokine IL-6.
IL-8 secretion was affected (40% and 38% respectively) by both
MyD88 and TRIF knockdown in HEV infected cells at 24 h
(p = 0.0009 and 0.0013 respectively) (Figure 4C, 5C) and the
inhibition continued (60% and 30% respectively) till 48 h p.i. (data
not shown). Contribution of both MyD88 and TRIF pointed
towards involvement of TLR2/TLR4 and TLR3 in recognizing
viral capsid and viral dsRNA respectively.
RANTES induction was down-regulated only by MyD88
knockdown (p = 0.0003) at 24 h post HEV infection (Figure 4D).
This indicated ability of HEV capsid alone in triggering the
response. Taken together, these results show MyD88 and TRIF
mediated induction of inflammatory proteins in HEV infected
A549 cells.
MAVS knockdown resulted in significant up-regulation of IL-6,
IL-8 and RANTES secretions by the HEV infected cells. The
respective transcript levels were also significantly up-regulated
than the controls confirming the ELISA results (Figure 6B–G).
However, there was no increased activation of the promoters (data
not shown) indicating involvement of either different transcription
regulatory factors or altogether different regulatory mechanism.
We used influenza virus as a control to confirm the expected
effect of MyD88, TRIF and MAVS knockdown as this virus
induces pathways involving all three adaptors while triggering
antiviral response [31]. IL-6 induction in influenza virus infection
was inhibited (40%) at 24 h time point in MyD88 suppressed cells
while RANTES induction was inhibited by both TRIF and
MyD88 suppressed cells (Fig. S3A and C). As expected, influenza
virus triggered robust antiviral response with involvement of all the
three adaptors.
Discussion
The innate immune system is the major contributor of acute
inflammation induced by microbial infections [3]. Though
macrophages and DCs play important roles in development of
this response, nonprofessional cells such as epithelial cells,
endothelial cells, and fibroblasts are also involved in this [32]. It
is not yet known how HEV overcomes the effects of host cellular
immunity during the initial phases of establishment in the host
cells. Work presented in this manuscript shows analysis of antiviral
responses in A549 cells after HEV infection.
Significant up-regulations of inflammatory chemokine genes,
RANTES and CCL20 were seen in the HEV infected cells
(Table 1 and Fig. S1). CCL20 has been shown to mediate
recruitment of CCR6 (CCL20 receptor) expressing leukocytes
early upon infections. CCR6 is present on the surface of immature
DCs, B and subsets of T cells including effector/memory T cells,
Th17 and T regulatory cells. Several studies have identified
CCL20/CCR6 interactions contributing to the pathology of
inflammatory conditions as well as amplifying local immune
response in inflamed liver [33]. RANTES was also consistently up￾regulated at both transcription and translation levels in HEV and
HEV-UV infected cells. RANTES is known to be secreted by
fibroblasts and epithelial cells in viral infections resulting in
enhanced leukocyte recruitment. Intra-hepatic expression of
RANTES has been positively correlated with the severity of
hepatic inflammation in chronic hepatitis C [34]. In view of this,
both CCL20 and RANTES require more in depth studies to
understand their roles in HEV induced liver inflammation.
Comparable secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a by cells infected
with HEV and HEV-UV suggested triggering by HEV capsid.
Furthermore, inability of baculovirus expressed soluble capsid
protein to elicit inflammatory response suggested recognition of
viral capsid structure and not soluble capsid protein molecules by
the cells. Significant up-regulation of inflammatory genes selec￾tively in live HEV infected cells as compared to HEV-UV
NF-kB p65 subunit in the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts: A549 cells infected with HEV, HEV-UV and H3N2 or treated with recombinant human TNFa
(20 ng/ml) at indicated time points were processed for making nuclear (upper panel) and cytoplasmic (lower panel) extracts, analyzed for
immunoblotting with p65 antibody, Respective membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-nucleolin or anti-actin antibody. Densitometric
analysis was performed to quantify the ratio of the density of p65 bands in the nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions to the nucleolin/actin band. The relative
density value (RDV) of each band was calculated and normalized RDV values with respect to mock infected sample are represented on the bar graph.
An uninfected cell cultures treated with 20 ng/ml of TNFa for 1 and 2 h was included as a positive control to study NF-kB activation (Fig. 3C–E). (D–E)
HEV infection induces time dependent IkBa phosphorylation and degradation: Total cellular extracts from HEV infected or TNFa treated cells were
analyzed for immunoblotting by using anti-IkBaSer32 phospho specific antibody or anti-IkBa antibody at indicated time points. The densitometric
analysis was performed as mentioned in figure 3B–C. (F–G) UV inactivated HEV is able to induce transient IkBa phosphorylation and degradation:
Total cellular extracts from A549 cells infected with UV inactivated HEV (HEV-UV) at indicated time points were sperated on SDS-PAGE and processed

luciferase reporter assay: A549 cells were co-transfected with 500 ng of pNF-kB -Luc (firefly luciferase) or pIFN-b-Luc and 5 ng of pGL4.75 hRluc/CMV
(Renilla luciferase). Transfected cells were infected after 24 h with either HEV or UV inactivated HEV. Cell lysates were assayed for dual luciferase
activity. Results are given as Log2 values of relative light units obtained from three independent experiments.

indicated involvement of newly synthesized viral molecules in
enhancing initial signal by the capsid. For viruses such as
influenza, HIV-1, HTLV-1 and HBV it is known that even a
short interaction between viral and cellular surface proteins can
trigger cellular response leading to the first wave of cytokine
production [35]. HEV does not induce apoptosis in infected cells
and it is proposed that liver damage due to HEV infection is
immune mediated. Prabhu et al., [36] have shown adequate
presence of CD8+T cells in the liver biopsies of HEV infected
patients suggesting their major role in HEV pathogenesis. Robust
inflammatory response initiated at the early stages of HEV
infection, as seen in our results, has the potential to initiate massive
infiltration of lymphocytes in the liver and in turn result into
immune mediated damage to the tissue.
Up-regulated levels of TLR2 and TLR4 and induction of
similar inflammatory response with HEV and HEV-UV led us to
speculate involvement of these cell surface TLRs in recognizing
the viral capsid. It is documented that TLR2 and TLR4 recognize
viral capsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins in measles virus,
hepatitis C virus, murine leukemia virus, mouse mammary tumor
virus and coxsackievirus B4 virus infections [4]. Parallel up￾regulation of IRAK2 transcript levels in HEV infected cells
supported our speculation of TLR involvement as IRAK2 has
been shown to interact with TRAF6 and MyD88 resulting in
activation of NF-kB [37]. NF-kB responsive A20/TNFAIP3 gene
is known to down-regulate NF-kB signaling through the cooper￾ative activity of its two ubiquitin-editing domains [38]. A
significant up-regulation of A20 transcripts in HEV infected cells
during 12–96 h period suggested autoregulation of NF-kB levels
(Table 1) and attempt of the host cells to keep check on the
inflammatory signal.
The low level expression of IFN-a, b and v genes at 12–24 h
correlated well with the initial basal level expression and later
(48 h) lower level up-regulation of ISGs (Table S2). This was
expected as there were no secreted IFNs in the cell supernatants to
induce ISGs in the neighboring, uninfected cells. However, in the
infected cells, the lower level up-regulation of type I IFNs possibly
resulted in up-regulation of ISGs in autocrine manner. There was
no induction of IFNs in HEV-UV infected cells. There is recent
report documenting ability of HEV in downregulating IFN-a
signaling in A549 cells via ORF3 mediated inhibition of STAT1
phosphorylation [18]. Due to absence of secreted IFNs in our
experiments, it is difficult to comment upon the role of ORF3 in
keeping lower levels of ISGs in HEV infected cells.
All TLRs except TLR3, initiate signaling through MyD88
adaptor while TLR3 recognising viral dsRNA recruits TRIF
Figure 4. Hepatitis E virus induced secretion of inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines crucially requires MyD88 adaptor. A549
cells were transfected either with non-target control siRNA or MyD88
siRNA and infected with HEV and monitored for secreted cytokines/
chemokines. (A) MyD88 protein levels: Cell lysates of mock transfected,
control siRNA transfected and MyD88 siRNA transfected cells were
analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and the blots were stained using anti￾MyD88 and anti-actin antibodies. The densitometric ratio of each time
point was compared relative to the steady state ratio of mock cells (lane
1) which was set at 100% and percent (%) reduction of the protein after
siRNA knock down was calculated. (B–D) Knockdown of MyD88 adaptor
protein reduced HEV induced secretion of (B) IL-6, (C) IL-8 and (D)
RANTES: IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES levels in the culture supernatants were
assessed by ELISAs, 24 h post-infection. Culture supernatants from the
unifected cells and transfected cells with control non-target siRNA were
similarly analysed for ELISAs and served as controls also for the
experiments given in figure 5 and 6. The data represents mean 6 SD of
three independent experiments.

which is also shared by TLR4 [5]. RIG-I and MDA5 interact with
MAVS and trigger signaling pathways which are also activated by
TLRs [39]. Our siRNA experiments convincingly showed
dependence of IL-6 and RANTES expression on MyD88 pathway
in HEV infected cells. This suggested involvement of TLR2 and/
or TLR4 in sensing HEV capsids (Figure 4). IL-8 expression was
reduced by both MyD88 and TRIF siRNAs (,40% in both cases)
(Figure 4B, 5C). This indicated possible involvement of TLR3 and
TLR4 in sensing HEV.
MAVS knockdown surprisingly resulted in increased secretion
of IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES by HEV infected cells, without
increasing the IFN secretion. MAVS being the sole adaptor for all
RLRs, these results indicated absence of RLR trigger in eliciting
antiviral response against HEV in A549 cells. On the contrary, it
indicated that HEV recruits MAVS/MAVS mediated pathways in
keeping check on the inflammatory response.
HEV replicates its genome via dsRNA intermediates which are
expected to be sensed either by RLRs (RIG-I/MDA5) or by
TLR3. Our results indicated that by some means HEV manages
to restrict RLR mediated innate immune response. This could be
due to, i) HEV replication occurs in restricted compartments
within the cells where viral RNA remains undetected by the
cytosolic sensors or ii) HEV actively downregulates MAVS
mediated induction of inflammatory response. There is indirect
evidence that HEV replicates in the endoplasmic reticulum [40].
With our observations showing involvement of TRIF in addition
to MyD88 in inducing inflammatory response it can be
hypothesized that, dsRNA synthesized during HEV replication is
recognized by TLR3 present in the endosomal compartments
leading to TRIF mediated IFN activation. Complete absence of
IFNs with HEV-UV infection supports this presumption. We have
recently documented association of deubiquitination and deISGy￾lation activity with the papain like cysteine protease (PCP) domain
in HEV ORF1 [41]. N-terminal caspase recruitment domain of
RIG-I is known to undergo robust ubiquitination and activation,
initiating antiviral response in mammalian cells [42]. It would be
interesting to see whether HEV PCP is involved in any way in
downregulating RLR mediated signaling.
In conclusion, HEV induces MyD88 and TRIF mediated
activation of IRF3 and NF-kB, apparently via TLR2, TLR3 and
TLR4 sensing, leading to inflammatory response. It is now an
established fact that the innate response greatly influences
subsequent adaptive response in viral infections. Use of lung
epithelial cells, A549, which are not natural target cells for HEV
infection, is the main limitation of this study. Immune cell
activation is differentially regulated depending on the cell type
involved and it would be worthwhile to see the response of
different cell types such as primary hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (liver
macrophages), macrophages and dendritic cells to HEV infection.
It is known that HEV induced fulminant hepatic failure occurs due
to immune dysfunction. This study has generated several
