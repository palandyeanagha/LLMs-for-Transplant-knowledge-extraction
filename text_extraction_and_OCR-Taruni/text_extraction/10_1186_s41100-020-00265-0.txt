Abstract
Kidney injury is a common finding in patients with liver disease. Bile cast nephropathy (also known as cholemic
nephropathy) is an overlooked cause of renal injury in patients with hyperbilirubinemia. It can occur as a result of
the toxic effects of bilirubin and bile acids on the renal tubules via several mechanisms. Bile cast nephropathy has
characteristic histopathological changes consisting of bilirubin cast deposition in the distal nephron along with
tubular epithelial cell injury. Treatment is based on the reversal of liver injury. This review aims to describe bile cast
nephropathy in terms of its clinical and morphological features and to shed light on diagnostic techniques. In
addition, we present data on management of such nephropathy while reviewing all the reported cases of bile cast
nephropathy.
Keywords: Bile cast nephropathy, Cholemic nephropathy, Hyperbilirubinemia, Extracorporeal therapy
Introduction
Bile cast nephropathy is a form of acute kidney injury
(AKI) manifesting in patients with severe direct hyperbi￾lirubinemia [1]. It is a rare entity that is often thought of
last when it comes to explaining an AKI. It is also
known as cholemic nephropathy, bile acid nephropathy,
biliary nephrosis, and jaundice related nephropathy [1–
3].
It was initially described by Qunicke in 1899 in aut￾opsy studies of patients with acute jaundice and renal in￾sufficiency [2, 4]. Later in 1922, Haessler et al. showed
that biliary salt sediments were found in the urine of
dogs and humans with jaundice, and that the amount of
sediments decreased as jaundice resolved [1, 3–5]. The
gold standard for diagnosing this entity is renal biopsy.
The prevalence of bile cast nephropathy is probably
underestimated as pathological diagnosis is often missing
considering the increased bleeding risk of renal biopsy in
coagulopathic patients with liver disease; however, it has
been recognized more frequently lately with the
utilization of transjugular renal biopsy [1, 2, 5, 6]. None￾theless, Nayak et al. conducted a study on postmortem
kidney biopsy [7]. Their aim was to investigate the fre￾quency of bile cast nephropathy detected on postmor￾tem renal biopsy among patients with decompensated
cirrhosis who had been admitted with AKI due to hepa￾torenal syndrome. They were able to detect bile cast ne￾phropathy in 44.8% of all the postmortem renal biopsy
specimens and in 72.1% of the patients with acute on
top of chronic liver failure. So, it is imperative to
recognize this entity early, as directed treatment and
management may lead to a better prognosis [2].
Pathophysiology of bile cast nephropathy
Bile cast nephropathy is suspected in the setting of an
acute kidney injury with concomitant direct hyperbiliru￾binemia. Normally, most bile acids are reabsorbed in the
ileum and then transported back to the liver via portal
blood circulation to inhibit bile acid synthesis [8]. Small
amounts of bile acids are recovered in kidney [8]. Renal￾hepatic circulation of bile salts is via organic solute

transporters in the proximal tubules [9]. During chole￾stasis, there is an upregulation of the hepatocytic baso￾lateral bile acid pumps in an attempt to excrete the
excess direct bilirubin into the blood [2]. With hyperbi￾lirubinemia, the kidneys will adapt by excreting the ex￾cess bile acids, mainly in the proximal convoluted
tubules; in fact, it has been reported that in some cases
the renal clearance of bilirubin increases from below 5%
to almost 90% [2, 10].
Bilirubin excess has deleterious effects on many fronts
when it comes to the kidneys. Bilirubin exerts an oxida￾tive stress on the tubules leading to damage of the tubu￾lar cell membranes [1–3, 11]. This damage could lead, in
some patients, to tubular cell hypertrophy [3, 11, 12].
This was observed in 73.5% of autopsies performed on
jaundiced individuals [13]. Holmes’ autopsies demon￾strated swelling of the tubular epithelium, pigmented
casts, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of the parietal layer
of Bowman’s capsule [13]. Similar to the changes seen in
diabetic nephropathy, tubuloepithelial hypertrophy is the
most likely precursor of later irreversible changes in the
tubulointerstitial architecture leading to tubular atrophy
and interstitial fibrosis [14]. Bilirubin also inhibits mito￾chondrial oxidative phosphorylation leading to more
damage to the tubular cells with subsequent decrease in
adenosine triphosphate activity [2, 15–17]. Such a de￾crease leads to mitochondrial defects with increased
penetration of cell membranes resulting in modified
electrolyte content and cell volume [17]. Particularly,
bile acids have been reported to cause inhibition of
Na+
/H+
, Na+
/K+
, and Na+
/Cl− transporters resulting
in alterations in the pH in the tubules and contribut￾ing to an acidic milieu that favors cast formation [2,
6, 15, 18]. To note, however, bilirubin contains nei￾ther heme nor iron; both of which have been associ￾ated with kidney injury [15].
The key finding in this disease entity is the tubular ob￾struction and injury caused by the bilirubin cast forma￾tion within the distal kidney tubules, a mechanism that
mimics the damage in myeloma cast nephropathy [11,
19]. Bile salts have low solubility in water, and normally
when filtered by the glomerulus, they are transported by
the proximal tubules back into the circulation [3, 20]. In
the case of extreme hyperbilirubinemia, these trans￾porters will be saturated, thus causing the tubules to be
over flooded with bilirubin, a key factor to enhance cast
formation and subsequently tubular obstruction, espe￾cially with increased acidity in the distal nephron [2, 3,
10, 21].
Another mechanism by which hyperbilirubinemia has
been associated with kidney injury is via its effect on sys￾temic and renal hemodynamics. In fact, studies in mice
have shown that excess bilirubin exerts negative ionotro￾pic and chronotropic effects on the heart, leading to a
decrease in kidney perfusion [2, 15, 18, 22]. The de￾pressed cardiac performance is occasionally termed
“jaundiced heart” by some authors and is expected to
improve after resolution of the hyperbilirubinemia [23,
24]. It is also proposed that the lack of enteral bile acids
results in systemic endotoxemia and subsequently
hypotension and a low perfusion state [1, 2, 22]. Thus,
hyperbilirubinemia is related to marked splanchnic and
systemic vasodilatation that results in a lower glomerular
filtration rate contributing to kidney injury [3, 25].
In summary, the kidney injury in bile cast nephropathy
can be due to the following mechanisms: tubular epithe￾lial injury, basement membrane effects causing tubular
leakage and obstruction, and hemodynamic changes af￾fecting both the kidneys and the systemic circulation.
An in vivo model using common bile duct ligation
(CBDL) in mice has been proposed to describe the
mechanism of kidney injury in cholemic nephropathy
[16]. CBDL induced renal tubular epithelial injury oc￾curred predominantly at the level of aquaporin 2–posi￾tive collecting ducts with tubular epithelial and
basement membrane defects as early as day 3 [16]. This
was followed by interstitial nephritis and progressive
tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis at 3, 6, and 8 weeks [16].
Pathology
Macroscopically, the kidney’s cortex and medulla of pa￾tients with hyperbilirubinemia appear yellow due to the
presence of bilirubin and bilirubin casts. After treatment
of these kidneys with formalin fixation, the bilirubin will
be converted to biliverdin and the color changes from
yellow to green [1, 3]. The green color is more promin￾ent in the medulla due to the presence of higher cast
concentration in the distal nephrons [1, 3].
The pathology induced by the excess bilirubin is
mainly limited to the tubules [1, 3, 16]. Light microscopy
and immunofluorescence would show no glomerular ab￾normalities [4, 10, 26]. Many case reports of kidney bi￾opsies have demonstrated bilirubin cast deposition
mainly in the distal renal tubules and minimally in the
proximal tubules [12, 15, 27]. A clinico-pathologic study
done by van Slambrouck et al. on 3 renal biopsies and
41 autopsy studies of patients with jaundice showed dis￾tal deposition of bile casts in more than 50% of them,
while only 6 biopsies had proximal tubular involvement
[1, 3, 5]. The degree of bile cast formation correlated sig￾nificantly with the severity of jaundice [1, 3].
Bile casts are formed of sloughed epithelial cells
and acellular material. Thus, they can be identified
the by Hall stain which detects bilirubin [17]. This
stain utilizes Fouchet reagent, which converts biliru￾bin to biliverdin thus yielding a green color (Fig. 1)
[1, 10, 28, 29]. Iron stain in these cases is negative in￾dicating the absence of heme.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a prominent feature
of biopsies of patients with bile cast nephropathy. Sev￾eral case studies have reported ATN as a feature in the
biopsy [10, 19] (Table 1). Pathological features include
loss of tubular brush borders, attenuated cytoplasm of
tubular cells, dilatation of the tubular lumen, cytoplas￾mic vacuolization, apical blebbing, and tubular necrosis
and desquamation [2, 4, 19, 28]. In the study done by
van Slambrouck, ATN was noted in 76% of the biopsies
[3, 5, 15, 26].
Another key finding on kidney biopsy in patients with
bile cast nephropathy is hypertrophy of the tubules [2, 3,
12]. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy stud￾ies show no abnormalities [4].
Approach and diagnosis
The diagnosis of bile cast nephropathy can be made clin￾ically when other causes of AKI have been ruled out.
The definitive diagnosis is via a kidney biopsy; however,
a transcutaneous kidney biopsy carries higher risk of
bleeding in those coagulopathic patients, and so it is sel￾dom performed. Moreover, since the pathology of bile
cast nephropathy is mainly evident in the distal nephron,
we may argue that a conventional kidney biopsy (which
reaches the cortex) might not reach these segments. A
trans-jugular renal biopsy (TJRB) approach might be a
reasonable alternative. Four hundred patients underwent
TJRB and were compared to four hundred patients who
underwent percutaneous renal biopsy [42]. They re￾ported a diagnostic tissue adequacy of 95.8%, with a
major complication rate of 1% [42]. Sam et al. described
their experience with TJRB in 29 patients with coexisting
kidney and liver diseases [43]. They concluded that TJRB
appears to be a safe and effective procedure for estab￾lishing a histological diagnosis in patients with advanced
liver disease and contraindications to conventional per￾cutaneous renal biopsy.
The diagnosis of bile cast nephropathy can be strongly
suspected when urinalysis shows bile crystals [12]; al￾though their role in the pathophysiology of the disease
remains unclear [2, 10–12]. In some cases, granular casts
have been reported due to the role of ATN in the patho￾physiology of bile cast nephropathy [11]. Hyperuricos￾uria also develops because bilirubin is said to inhibit the
absorption of uric acid in the proximal tubules [12]. Po￾tassium wasting also occurs and is consistent with the
tubular injury caused by the bilirubin casts.
Treatment and outcome
Treatment of bile cast nephropathy depends on prompt
management of hyperbilirubinemia to avoid kidney dam￾age. Several case studies reported reversal of kidney in￾jury with reduction of bile acid and bilirubin levels,
though at different recovery rates [10–12, 28]. We com￾piled a summary of the clinical and pathological charac￾teristics of all biopsy proven bile cast nephropathy
reported in literature since 2000 along with the manage￾ment modalities used (Table 1). We also included the
different outcomes with each treatment used in that
table.
Extensive initial injury has been associated with de￾layed recovery [3, 12, 28]. Currently, there are no ac￾cepted treatment guidelines; rather, there is a focus on
decreasing bilirubin levels and reversing the cause of the
liver injury. In case of biliary stones or tumors for in￾stance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
with or without stenting is used to relieve the obstruc￾tion. Removal of excess bilirubin and bile acids has been
carried out by extracorporeal therapies.
Extracorporeal therapies for bile cast nephropathy are
divided into two major groups: biologic and non￾biologic (Fig. 2) [44]. Biological devices use living liver
cells (human or porcine) to support the failing liver
through detoxification and synthetic function [45]. Non￾biologic devices use artificial membranes and adsorbents
for detoxification [44]. These include plasmapheresis
and albumin dialysis.
Plasmapheresis can be utilized to remove the excess
toxins and bilirubin in persistent cholestasis to improve
the symptoms and the outcomes [26]. Not only that, it
replenishes albumin, coagulation factors, and hepatic re￾generative stimulating substances [46]. Plasmapheresis is
mostly mentioned in the literature for the management
of liver failure [46–49]. Keklik et al. published their ex￾perience with plasma exchange as a treatment for pa￾tients with severe hyperbilirubinemia [48]. They
observed a statistically significant decline in total and
direct bilirubin levels after plasma exchange [48]. A case
of steroid induced bile cast nephropathy that was treated
with plasma exchange was also reported by El Khoury
et al. [50].

Albumin dialysis is based on the removal of unwanted
albumin-bound and water-soluble substances such as
bilirubin, bile acids, and other hepatotoxins which are
mostly albumin bound [44]. It can take place in two
forms: molecular absorbent recirculating system (MARS)
and single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD).
MARS consists of two separate dialysis circuits; the
first consists of exogenous human albumin in contact
with the patient’s blood via a semi-permeable polysul￾fone membrane while maintaining a constant flow of al￾bumin as dialysate in the extracapillary compartment
[44, 45]. A counter-current bicarbonate based dialysate
removes water soluble toxins from the toxin enriched al￾bumin solution. Albumin in the dialysate is regenerated
by adsorber columns containing activated charcoal and
anion exchange resin [51]. This regenerated albumin di￾alysate is then recirculated for new uptake of toxins in
the blood.
SPAD is a form of venovenous hemodialysis incorpor￾ating albumin into the conventional hemodialysis solu￾tion [52, 53]. Unlike MARS, the albumin dialysate is not
regenerated (single pass) [54]. Sens et al. reported drastic
improvement of kidney function in their patient with
cholemic nephropathy after one MARS and eight SPAD
sessions were performed [26].
MARS was compared to single-pass albumin dialysis
(SPAD) in terms of reduction of bilirubin levels and in￾fluence on other parameters such as creatinine [55]. Al￾though both systems reduced plasma bilirubin similarly
[55], MARS reduced creatinine and bile acids more

significantly [55]. This might support the role of MARS
in bile cast nephropathy.
In spite of suggested improvement with albumin dialy￾sis, these studies were small and hence large scale stud￾ies should be conducted to gather more outcome data
on this therapeutic technique. Medical therapy using ste￾roids, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, or lactulose
have little to no benefit in bile cast nephropathy [2].
Conclusion
Bile cast nephropathy should be kept in mind when ap￾proaching a patient with acute renal failure in the setting
of hyperbilirubinemia. Several mechanisms such as tubu￾lar damage, tubular obstruction, and hemodynamic
changes have been proposed to explain kidney injury in
patients with bile cast nephropathy. Definitive diagnosis
of this entity remains a challenge; nonetheless, there
seems to be a promising role for trans-jugular renal bi￾opsy. In the absence of a clear cause of renal injury, one
should consider initiating prompt treatment if bile cast
nephropathy is suspected. Suggested treatment options
include reversal of the cause of liver injury and initiation
of albumin dialysis. Studies are lacking whether pre￾emptive treatment with bilirubin lowering therapy can
help prevent kidney injury.
