Purpose: To analyze the influence of perioperative complications in the management of
biliary atresia (BA).
Methods: A retrospective study was performed using a total of 422 BA patients
who underwent Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) in a single institution between February
2016 and May 2017. Data on patients’ clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations,
perioperative complications, and outcomes were collected. Unpaired two-tailed t-test
and χ
2
test were employed for the comparison between BA patients with and without
perioperative complications. Cox regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors
for 2-years NLS in BA, and their influence on the 2-years NLS was analyzed using
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis as well as the log-rank test.
Results: The incidence of perioperative complications, 6-months jaundice clearance
(JC) and 2-years native liver survival (NLS) rate were 60.4, 59.5, and 56.6%, respectively.
Patients with perioperative complications had lower serum albumin (ALB) level, but higher
aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and international normalized
ratio (INR) levels when compared with those without perioperative complications (ALB,
P < 0.05; APRI, P < 0.01; INR, P < 0.05). Moreover, perioperative complications were
correlated with glucocorticoid administration (P = 0.002). Univariate Cox regression
analysis showed no relationship between perioperative complications and 2-years NLS
(P > 0.05). However, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated 6-months JC was an
independent protective factor for 2-years NLS [P < 0.0001, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.074,
95% confidence interval = 0.05–0.11], and concordance index of this prediction model
including age, weight, APRI, glucocorticoid, and 6-months JC was 0.811.
Conclusion: Although perioperative complication is common during and after KPE, it
had no influence on the prognosis of BA. However, assessment of the serum level of
total bilirubin after KPE may serve as an important predictor for the outcome in BA.

INTRODUCTION
Biliary atresia (BA) is a life-threatening pediatric hepatobiliary
disease that is caused by a progressive inflammatory and fibrotic
obliteration of the bile ducts (1). The pathophysiology of BA
is not yet clearly understood, and theories on the pathogenesis
of BA include immunological factors, genetic predisposition,
environmental toxins, and infection (2). In Asia, the BA
incidence (1/5,000–8,000 live births) is considerably higher
compared with that in Europe (1/15,000–20,000 live births) (3, 4).
According to the anatomical structure, the Japanese Society of
Pediatric Surgery classified BA into three types, including type
I BA (choledochal atresia), type II BA (the common hepatic duct
atresia), and type III BA (hepatic portal atresia) (5). Type III BA
was previously considered as the “uncorrectable” type with poor
outcomes affecting 80–95% of patients (6, 7).
When left untreated, BA patients will die of cirrhosis and
hepatic failure within 2 years (8). Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE)
is considered the first-line treatment for BA and restores bile
flow from the liver to the intestine (9). In previous studies, it
was demonstrated that native liver survival (NLS) rates ranged
from 20 to 76% at 1–3 years following KPE (10). If KPE
fails, liver transplantation is the definitive therapeutic option
(11). Even in cases of successful KPE, complications occur
in ∼60% of patients; however, large cohort studies that focus
on the comprehensive perioperative complications of BA are
limited (12, 13). Perioperative complications have previously
been defined as complications that occurred during and up
to 30 days after surgery (14). Pressing questions for surgeons
to answer are as follows: What are the characteristics of
perioperative complications of BA? And what is the impact of
perioperative complications on the outcome of BA? This study
aimed to characterize perioperative complications of BA and
analyze the predictors of prognosis, and the relationship between
perioperative complications and prognosis in BA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Establishment of the Retrospective Cohort
This study was a retrospective study that was performed in
Children’s Hospital of Fudan University (Shanghai, China). The
study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethical review
board. As type III BA was the most common and prone to
poor outcomes, this study focused on type III BA. A total of
422 type III BA patients were enrolled. The follow-up endpoints
were as follows: (1) 24 months after KPE; (2) patients passed
away or underwent liver transplantation. Inclusion criteria were
as follows: (1) surgical exploration and cholangiography that
confirmed type III BA; (2) KPE was performed by the same
operation team. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients
who suffered from immunodeficiency, hemolytic jaundice, and
life-threatening serious diseases involving other systems such
as heart failure, respiratory failure, and kidney failure, and so
on; (2) follow-up was <24 months; (3) data on perioperative
complications and 2-years outcome were unavailable.
Operative Technique and Postoperative
Care
The KPE procedure adopted the classic Kasai procedure with
spur valve for antireflux, and the length of the jejunal Roux-en￾Y loop was 30–35 cm. Unified postoperative adjuvant therapies
included antibiotics to prevent cholangitis (first 2 weeks after
KPE: intravenous cefoperazone sulbactam, 100 mg/kg/d, every
8 h, and ornidazole 20 mg/kg/d, every 12 h; from 3 weeks
to 6 months after KPE: sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 25
mg/kg/d, every 12 h, and cefaclor, 20 mg/kg/d, every 8 h, are
taken alternately every 2 weeks), ursodeoxycholic acid (20
mg/kg/d, twice a day), drugs of liver protection (glycyrrhizin,
25 mg/d, twice a day), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A and
D drops, 2,000 IU/d, every day; vitamin E 10 mg/d, every
day; vitamin K1, 5 mg/time, biweekly), and nutritional support.
When insufficient bile flow was presented with gray-pigmented
stool without any surgery-related complications, glucocorticoid
(methylprednisolone starting at 4 mg/kg/d and tapering down for
3 months) was used. Jaundice clearance (JC) was defined as total
bilirubin (TBIL) <20 µmol/L (15, 16).

patients with different type of complications. (C) Distribution of disease-related complication (DC). (D) Distribution of surgical complication (SC).
Data Collection
Baseline data were collected from each patient at the time of KPE,
including gender, age, weight, the presence of cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection [immunoglobulin M (IgM+)], and extrahepatic
malformations. The use of glucocorticoids and perioperative
complications were acquired during and up to 30 days post￾KPE. Perioperative complications were classified into surgical
complications (SCs) and disease-related complications (DCs).
Surgical complications were defined as complications that were
directly related to surgery, whereas DCs were defined as
complications that were related to the underlying disease (17,
18). Disease-related complications included symptoms that were
absent pre-KPE, but occurred after KPE, and can be classified
as liver dysfunction (hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy), ascites,
cholangitis, portal hypertension (esophageal variceal bleeding),
and intrahepatic biliary lakes (hepatic cyst) (18). Serum
albumin (ALB) <30 g/L was considered hypoproteinemia (19).
Abnormal coagulation was judged by the presence of prolonged
prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin
time (APTT), or higher international normalized ratio (INR)

or decreased fibrinogen (FIB) (reference ranges: PT, 11–14.5 s;
APTT, 26–40 s; INR, 0.8–1.2; FIB, 2–4 g/L). Cholangitis was
diagnosed upon clinical symptoms (unexplained fever, recurrent
jaundice, and acholic stools) and laboratory examinations
(elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein, and
higher bilirubin levels) (20). Ascites and hepatic cyst were found
by the abdominal ultrasonography post-KPE. From each patient,
laboratory examinations were collected at KPE including TBIL,
direct bilirubin (DBIL), ALB, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bile
acid, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),
hemoglobin, and INR. The above parameters were reevaluated by
collecting medical records during hospitalization and outpatient
clinical records or telephone communication after discharge up
to 30 days after KPE. The follow-up data included JC and NLS at 1
month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after KPE. Among
them, 2-years NLS was set as the main prognostic indicator in
this study.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version
23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software 3.6.0
(Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ, USA). Continuous data
are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, and categorical
variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentages.
Unpaired two-tailed t-test and χ
2
test were employed for the
comparison between BA patients with and without perioperative
complications. Univariate Cox regression analysis was employed
to choose the potential predictive factors of 2-years NLS of
BA (P < 0.2), and then the prediction model was established
by the above factors and was analyzed using multivariate Cox
regression analysis. Results were expressed as the hazard ratio
(HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). In addition, the NLS rate
was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, as well as
the log-rank test. Values were considered statistically significant
when P < 0.05.
RESULTS
Baseline Data of the BA Study Cohort
From February 2016 to May 2017, 422 type III BA patients
were enrolled. The baseline characteristics at the time of KPE
are presented in Table 1. The mean age was around 2 months,
and the numbers of male and female patients were comparable.
As expected, BA patients manifested hepatocellular damage and
signs of obstructive jaundice with elevated DBIL, bile acids,
and GGT. Approximately one-third of children were infected
with CMV. A total of 51 extrahepatic malformations were
detected in 47 patients (11.1%), including cardiac defects (38
patients, 9.0%), intestinal malformation (10 patients, 2.4%),
splenic malformation (two patients, 0.5%), and visceral inversion
(one patient, 0.2%). To improve the insufficient bile flow, 271
patients (64.2%) were administered glucocorticoids after KPE.
The time to initial glucocorticoid treatment ranged from 5 to
60 days (median = 27 days) after KPE. Among the population
with glucocorticoids, a good bile drainage occurred in 95 patients
(30.06%), 135 patients (49.81%), 136 patients (50.18%), and
116 patients (42.80%) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after KPE,
respectively. In total, the rate of JC climbed to the highest
(59.5%) at 6 months after KPE and then fell slightly (52.4%)
at 2 years after KPE. A total of 239 patients (56.6%) of BA
patients survived with native liver; the rest comprised those
with liver transplantation (18.7%) and death (24.6%) at 2
years after KPE. During the perioperative period, a total of
three patients (0.7%) passed away. One patient who underwent
KPE at the age of 136 days died of liver failure. Another
patient who underwent KPE at the age of 45 days died of
gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension. A third
patient at day 38 after KPE suffered from intestinal obstruction
and abnormal coagulation and died after her parents insisted on
giving up treatment.

patients with or without perioperative complications.
Characteristics of Perioperative
Complications in the BA Study Cohort
In total, 255 patients (60.4%) had perioperative complications
(Figure 1A). Two hundred forty-three patients (57.6%)
suffered from one to three different types of complications
per patient (Figure 1B), and only 12 patients (2.8%) suffered
from four to seven different types of complications per
patient. Furthermore, perioperative complications were
divided into DCs and SCs; 246 patients (58.3%) had DCs,
which mainly consisted of hypoalbuminemia, abnormal
coagulation, ascites, and cholangitis (Figure 1C). However,
only 29 patients (6.9%) suffered from SCs, which included
intestinal obstruction, anastomotic fistula, hemorrhage, and
chyle leakage (Figure 1D).
Comparison Between BA Patients With
and Without Perioperative Complications
To understand the difference between BA patients with and
without perioperative complications, we compared their
characteristics from the basic information, malformation,
laboratory examination, treatment, and prognosis (Table 2). The
results showed that patients with perioperative complications
had lower serum ALB level, but higher APRI and INR levels
when compared with those without perioperative complications
(ALB, P < 0.05; APRI, P < 0.01; INR, P < 0.05). Moreover,
perioperative complications were correlated with glucocorticoid
administration (P = 0.002); less glucocorticoids were
administered in the patients with perioperative complications
(odds ratio = 0.518, 95% CI = 0.340–0.791). We focused on the
correlation between perioperative complication and prognosis
(NLS), and no significant differences were observed between the
two groups (P > 0.05).
Predictors for 2-Years Native Liver Survival
of BA
The survival curve of 2-years NLS is shown in Figure 2A.
In this study, NLS was compared based on the presence of
perioperative complication; Kaplan–Meier survival analysis also
showed that BA patients with complications, and those without
had comparable 2-years NLS (P = 0.551, Figure 2B). Therefore,
perioperative complication was not a predictor for the 2-years
NLS in BA.
To further explore the crucial factors that affected the 2-years
NLS in BA, we first performed the univariate Cox regression
analysis (Table 3). To avoid missing potential risk factors, we set
the P threshold at 0.2. The results revealed that age, weight, APRI,
glucocorticoid, and JC (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) were potential
risk factors for 2-years NLS. Subsequently, four prediction
models were established by the combination of age, weight,
APRI, glucocorticoid, and JC at different time points after KPE
(Table 4). The results showed JC was an independent protective
factor for 2-years NLS (1-month JC, P = 0.008, HR = 0.070;
3-months JC, P = 0.000, HR = 0.060; 6-months JC, P = 0.000,
HR = 0.074; 12-months JC, P = 0.000, HR = 0.051). To validate
the appropriate model in predicting 2-years NLS, we compared
concordance indexes (C indexes) and found they were 0.62,
0.76, 0.81, and 0.83 in the prediction models with 1-month
JC, 3-months JC, 6-months JC, and 12-months JC, respectively
(Table 4). Given the timeliness of the prediction model, we
believed that the model with 6-months JC was the most effective
in predicting 2-years NLS (C index: 0.81). Kaplan–Meier survival

analysis also supported the above findings that BA patients with
JC had a remarkably higher 2-years NLS than those with jaundice
(P < 0.01) (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large study that analyzed
perioperative complications after KPE for patients with type
III BA. In our study, the incidence and mortality rates of
perioperative complications were 60.4 and 0.7%, respectively,
which were much lower compared to the findings that were
presented previously (96.8 and 2%, respectively) (14, 21). This
may be related to the fact that our institution, the largest BA
center in China, is highly experienced in performing KPE. In
a multicenter study in Europe, it was also observed that high
caseload benefited outcomes (22, 23). Most patients (243, 57.6%)
had one to three different types of complications, and DCs were
the most prevalent (246, 58.3%). The most common type of
DCs was hypoalbuminemia, followed by abnormal coagulation,
ascites, cholangitis, portal hypertension, and hepatic cysts. The
incidence of perioperative cholangitis was low (8.5%), which was
potentially due to the short perioperative observation period
of 30 days. Notably, recurrent cholangitis can lead to a lower

NLS (24). Patients who experience a fever and worsening
jaundice need to be vigilant of cholangitis (24, 25), and the
use of antireflux valves, jejunal Roux-en-Y loop and antibiotics
may help to reduce the occurrence of cholangitis (25, 26).
In a recent study in 2015, it was shown that SCs affected
41% of 153 patients (27), which was much higher than our
results (6.9%). In our study cohort, we did observe hemorrhage,
anastomotic fistula, intestinal obstruction, and chyle leakage;
however, hernia and abscess complications that have been
reported in previous studies were not observed (27). Our data
showed that intestinal complications (intestinal obstruction and
anastomotic fistula) were the most frequent SCs, which was
consistent with the findings presented in other reports (14).
After KPE, patients with acute abdominal pain must immediately
and carefully be assessed for intestinal complications. In order
to reduce intestinal complications, care must be taken to
accurately close the mesenteric defect and to not twist the
intestinal loop during KPE (28). The incidence of hemorrhage
was 3.1% without massive bleeding or hemorrhagic shock, which
was lower than the findings reported previously (5%) (27).

reduce hemorrhage. In this study, serum ALB concentration,
INR, and APRI had a significant change in BA patients with
perioperative complications when compared with those without
complications, which indicated that liver synthetic functions
or fibrosis may be risk factors for disease-related perioperative
complications in BA.
In previous studies, it has been shown that the short-term (1–3
years) NLS rate of BA ranged from 20.3 to 75.8% (10). Consistent
with this, in our study, the 1-year and 2-years NLS rates were 78.0
and 56.6%, respectively. Although perioperative complications
were common in BA patients, they were not predictors for
2-years NLS, which suggested perioperative complications had
no impact on the BA prognosis. However, JC was considered
a crucial predictor for improved NLS (11, 29–32). In a large
study in Japan, it was demonstrated that TBIL <17.1 µmol/L at
3 months post-KPE predicted an improved NLS (33). Moreover,
in another multicenter study in the United States, it was shown
that TBIL <34.2 µmol/L at 3 months after KPE was a predictor
for improved NLS (34). In this study, the JC (TBIL <20 µmol/L)
rate was also highly predictive for 2-years NLS. Furthermore,
we evaluated the accuracy of prediction models by comparing
C index and found the prediction model with 6-months JC

Du et al. Perioperative Complication in BA
was more appropriate than other models with 1-month JC, 3-
months JC, and 12-months JC, which may be explained by the
highest level at 6 months after KPE. Taken together, these findings
suggested that JC after KPE resulted in a good bile flow with
better NLS.
Treatment with adjuvant steroids after KPE has previously
been used to assist restoring bile flow and anti-inflammation;
however, the effects of steroids on BA outcome remain
controversial (35, 36). In several studies, no benefits of
postoperative steroids on prognosis were observed (36, 37),
whereas other studies showed that treatment with adjuvant
steroids after KPE may improve short-term (≤1 year) JC. In this
study, our results revealed that patients treated with adjuvant
steroids initially suffered from no postoperative bile drainage and
also had a higher risk obtaining a low 2-years NLS (HR = 1.992,
95% CI = 1.419–2.797, P = 0.000). The paradoxical effects of the
use of steroids on the prognosis of BA remain to be elucidated.
In this study, the average age at KPE was 62.9 ± 18.4 days,
which was similar to that published in international journals (38).
A young age, especially <60 days old at KPE, has been widely,
although not universally, linked to improved outcome in BA,
which may be explained by the milder liver fibrosis in younger
patients (16, 39–41). However, Song et al. (42) demonstrated that
BA patients younger than 40 days had a poorer NLS rate and that,
in these patients, severe liver fibrosis may account for the reverse
consequence (35, 39). Interestingly, our results showed that age
at KPE had no significant impact on prognosis of BA. Despite
the controversy, it has been advised that infants with cholestasis
need to be evaluated and appropriately managed on time and
that when BA is diagnosed KPE should be performed as soon as
possible (43–45).
Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index reflects
portal fibrogenesis and could diagnose liver fibrosis in BA (40,
46). Ihn et al. (29) demonstrated that APRIs at month 4, GGT
at month 5, and JC at month 6 after KPE were independent risk
factors for NLS. Grieve et al. (47) also supported the role of APRI
at KPE in predicting NLS using univariate analysis. Our results
showed that APRI at KPE had significance in predicting NLS
without considering other factors, but exerted a modest effect in
the prediction model for NLS. Therefore, monitoring the change
of APRI may be valuable in predicting NLS in BA.
Studies in the United Kingdom and Germany (48, 49)
demonstrated that approximately 10% of BA patients were
infected with CMV. However, a much higher incidence of CMV
infection (34–69%) was reported in Brazil, Sweden, Pakistan,
China, and South Africa (50–54). In the current study, CMV
infection was present in 139 patients (32.9%). The varied
incidence of CMV infection may be explained by the different
racial background (55). Hepatotropic viral infections have been
proposed as a causative mechanism of action for bile duct and
immune destruction (56). Liver T-cell responses to CMV and
deficiency of regulatory T cells in BA aggravated inflammation
and autoreactivity, which potentially allowed for exaggerated bile
duct injury (57). Zani et al. (49) found that BA patients with
positive CMV IgM had lower JC and NLS. However, our results
indicated that CMV infection had little impact on prognosis,
which was consistent with the findings presented in two German
studies (48, 58). The above results suggested a controversial role
of CMV infection in BA. In line with the data of Zani et al. (49),
our results also indicated that CMV-positive BA patients were
significantly older than those who were CMV negative (CMV
negative: 60.69 ± 18.43 days; CMV positive: 67.36 ± 17.70 days;
P < 0.001), implying that CMV infection was simply a secondary
phenomenon rather than a factor involved in the etiology of
BA. Therefore, our data demonstrated that CMV may not play
a major role in the pathogenesis of BA, and further studies are
needed in the future.
This was a single-center retrospective study, which was
considered a limitation. Nevertheless, strict inclusion and
exclusion criteria were adopted, and all surgeries were performed
by the same surgical team, which would increase the consistency
and could be regarded as an advantage. A 2-years NLS
rate represented a short-term prognosis when compared with
the 10–20-years results that have been reported in other
studies. However, in this study, multivariate analysis models
were applied, and important predictors for prognosis were
identified, including age, weight, APRI, glucocorticoids, and
JC. Notwithstanding these limitations, this study, in which
a large sample size was used, comprehensively revealed
the characteristics of BA perioperative complications and
prognosis, thereby providing the scope for future research in
perioperative management.
In conclusion, perioperative complication was common in
BA, but was not a predictor for 2-years NLS. However, 6-months
JC after KPE was an independent protective factor for 2-years
NLS. Therefore, monitoring the dynamic change of serum TBIL
and taking the corresponding treatments after KPE may be
crucial in improving the survival rate of native liver in BA.
