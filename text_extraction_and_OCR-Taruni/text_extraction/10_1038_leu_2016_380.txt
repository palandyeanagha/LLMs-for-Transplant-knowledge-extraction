Little real-world evidence is available to describe the recent trends in treatment costs and outcomes for patients with multiple
myeloma (MM). Using the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases linked with social security administration death records,
this study found that the percentage of MM patients using novel therapy continuously increased from 8.7% in 2000 to 61.3% in
2014. Compared with MM patients diagnosed in earlier years, those diagnosed after 2010 had higher rates of novel therapy use and
better survival outcomes; patients diagnosed in 2012 were 1.25 times more likely to survive 2 years than those diagnosed in 2006.
MM patients showed improved survival over the study period, with the 2-year survival gap between MM patients and matched
controls decreasing at a rate of 3% per year. Total costs among MM patients have increased in all healthcare services over the years;
however, the relative contribution of drug costs has remained fairly stable since 2009 despite new novel therapies coming to
market. Findings from this study corroborate clinical data, suggesting a paradigm shift in MM treatment over the past decade that is
associated with substantial survival gains. Future studies should focus on the impact on specific novel agents on patients’
outcomes.

KEY POINTS
1. MM patient survival has increased steadily since 2000,
mirroring the introduction of several novel therapies.
2. Costs among newly diagnosed MM patients have increased
steadily since 2000, with a higher proportion of costs driven by
the cost of inpatient admissions and outpatient services.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm associated with
its characteristic clinical complications: anemia, infections, renal
impairment or bone destruction. MM is the second most
commonly diagnosed hematological neoplasm, with an incidence
rate of 6.2 per 100 000 individuals.1 In 2016, there were an
estimated 30 330 newly diagnosed cases in the United States,
accounting for ~ 1.8% of all new cancer cases.2 MM primarily
affects the elderly and is typically diagnosed between the ages of
65–74 years, with estimated 5-year survival rate ranging from
34.5% to 49.6% from 2000 to 2008.2 Patients with MM experience
severe bone, blood and renal complications, impacting therapy
choices and quality of life.3 As MM is a progressive and mostly
incurable disease,2 extending the time to disease progression in
newly diagnosed patients is currently the primary treatment goal
although cures may be attained in a small minority of patients.4
Traditional treatment regimens for the treatment of newly
diagnosed MM disease date back to the 1960s, with melphalan
plus prednisone as the first-line therapy along with combinations
of vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone.5 By the mid-1990s
stem cell transplantation (SCTs) became common but primarily for
younger patients with adequate kidney function.6 Over the past
decades, one of the major advances in the treatment regimen of
patients with MM has been the introduction of novel therapies,
including immune-modifying drugs (thalidomide and lenalido￾mide) and proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib.5–7 Many of
these novel therapies, such as lenalidomide and bortezomib are
currently recommended as initial treatment regimen in newly
diagnosed patients irrespective of SCT eligibility.3 Phase III
randomized trials have shown that addition of novel drugs such
as bortezomib and lenalidomide to melphalan–prednisone
improves both progression free (up to ~ 30 months) and median
overall survival (~4.7 years).8,9
In the last few years, the therapeutic landscape of MM improved
even further because of the US FDA approvals of pomalidomide,
another immune-modifying drug, in 2013, the monoclonal
antibodies daratumumab and elotuzumab in 2015, as well as
the new-generation proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib in 2012 and
ixazomib in 2015.10 However, the addition of the novel therapies
has raised logical concerns regarding the lifetime costs of MM
treatment. Cost data from clinical studies typically revolved
around specific interventions, smaller study populations and for
a relatively short study period. There are few published real-world
reports on patients with MM, and the available studies are limited
to discrete assessments of few treatment trends11 and associated
costs12 or survival.13 Despite evidence of improved survival and
increased costs, little research has been conducted that compre￾hensively examines trends in MM outcomes over time, assessing
both economic and clinical outcomes. This real-world study was
designed to evaluate trends in MM treatment use, associated
healthcare costs and patient survival in a large newly diagnosed

MM patient population in the United States. Furthermore, this
study also assessed the survival outcomes associated with novel
therapies and percent of total healthcare costs attributable to the
MM treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and study patients
This retrospective, observational, matched controls study was conducted
using US administrative claims data from the Truven Health Analytics
MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. Patients
with at least two non-diagnostic medical claims (that is, claims for a
professional encounter, not solely for diagnostic or testing purpose such as
laboratory, diagnostic radiology, imaging and so on) with MM (ICD-9
diagnosis code 203.0 × ) at least 30 days apart between 1 January 2000 and
30 September 2015 were included in the MM cohort. The date of the first
diagnosis claim for MM was designated as index date. Patients with any
claims for MM treatment (including autologous SCT) in the 12-month pre￾index period were excluded.
Control patients were randomly selected from a pool of patients without
any medical claims for an MM diagnosis but with a medical claim
indicating any other diagnosis. The date of the first medical claim for any
condition was designated as index date for controls. Controls were directly
matched with MM cohort in a 1:1 ratio based on the following variables:
index year, age (±5 years), gender and geographic region.
All patients were required to be 18 years and older on the index date
and have at least 12 months of continuous enrollment with medical and
pharmacy benefits prior to index and for at least 3 months post index.
Data sources
Both the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters and Medicare Supplemental Databases provide detailed
outcome measures including resource utilization and associated costs for
healthcare services performed in both inpatient and outpatient settings for
~ 40 million individuals covered annually by a geographically diverse
group of self-insured employers and private insurance plans across the US
The commercial Database contains the pharmacy and medical claims of
employees and their dependents, and the Medicare Supplemental
database profiles the healthcare experience of individuals with Medicare
supplemental insurance paid for by employers, capturing both the patient
and health plan borne healthcare costs. The MarketScan Research
Databases were further linked to the Social Security Administrations
Master Death File to obtain patient survival data from 2006 to 2012. All
study data were accessed with protocols compliant with US patient
confidentiality requirements, including the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 regulations. As the database is fully de￾identified and compliant with the HIPAA; consequently, this study was
exempted from Institutional Review Board approval.
Outcomes
Patient demographics measured as of the index date included age at
diagnosis, gender, insurance type, region of residence, total continuous
enrollment post index and index year. Owing to the time period of the
study, the novel treatments considered were bortezomib, carfilzomib,
lenalidomide, panobinostat, pomalidomide and thalidomide. The non￾novel treatments included arsenic trioxide, bendamustine, busulfan,
cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, melphalan, predni￾sone, dexamethasone, rituximab, vincristine and vorinostat.
All-cause healthcare resource utilization and costs were evaluated by
categories of inpatient admissions, outpatient services and prescription fills
associated with any condition, including wellness visits. All-cause
healthcare costs were defined as the sum of health plan paid and patient
paid costs incurred from fully adjudicated medical services (including
inpatient admissions and outpatient services) and prescription claims
during the follow-up period. Total all-cause costs were attributed to costs
from inpatient admissions, outpatient services and outpatient prescrip￾tions. In addition, MM treatment-related drug costs consisted of
prescription costs from outpatient pharmacy services defined using the
National Drug Code and infusion costs from medical services associated
with MM treatment defined using the Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System codes. Resource utilization and costs were reported as per
patient per month (PPPM), calculated as medical service and prescription
use and associated costs divided by number of days of enrollment and
multiplied by 30 days.
Survival time was measured as time from index date (that is, diagnosis
date for MM patients) to the date of death, even where death occurred
after disenrollment from the MarketScan Research Databases; patients
without a date of death were assumed alive at the end of the study period
(30 September 2015). Survival estimates were assessed by types of
treatment among newly diagnosed MM patients, and also compared
between MM patients and matched controls over the study period. In
addition, the proportion of patients who died or survived at least 2, 3 or 5
years after diagnosis were also described.
Not all identified MM patients were treated, likely representing cases of
smoldering MM (SMM), but this is impossible to differentiate as there is no
code specific to that stage of the disease. To assess the effect of the
inclusion of these patients on the results, a subgroup analysis was
conducted to examine the overall survival and total PPPM all-cause
healthcare costs only among newly diagnosed MM patients who actually
received MM treatment within 1 year after diagnosis.
Statistical methods
Categorical variables were presented as the frequency and percentages
and continuous variables were summarized by providing the means and
s.d.s. To compare difference in study outcomes between MM patients and
controls, χ
2
-tests were used for categorical variables and t-tests were for
continuous variables. The Kaplan–Meier method of survival analysis was
used to display overall survival, and log-rank tests were used to evaluate
the difference in survival distributions of two groups. Differences were
considered significant if the P-value was o0.05. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Patient demographics
A total of 19 417 newly diagnosed adult MM patients satisfied the
study criteria prior to matching to controls; a pool of 510 578
potential control patients were identified for matching. Of those,
18 260 MM patients were directly matched to controls and
included in the comparison analyses (Figure 1).
For the 19 417 newly diagnosed MM patients, the average age
at diagnosis was 65.9 years and 44.9% were female, which was
similar for the matched MM patient and controls (Table 1).
Compared with patients treated with non-novel therapy, the
relative age of MM patients treated with novel therapies within 1
year after diagnosis was different throughout the study period,
whereas those receiving novel therapies were 3–4 years younger
from 2004 to 2010, they were similar in age or older in other years.
In addition, no significant difference in urban vs rural location was
observed between patients treated with non-novel therapy and
those who received novel therapy during the study period
(P = 0.89).
Trends in MM treatment
MM treatment utilization was described among the entire newly
diagnosed MM population (n = 19 417) by identifying utilization of
novel and non-novel pharmacotherapies within 1 year after
diagnosis. The percentage of patients who used at least one novel
and one non-novel therapy (for example, lenalidomide+dexa￾methasone) within 1 year after diagnosis increased across the
study period from 7.5% in 2000 to 56.4% in 2014. As expected
treatment with only novel therapies after diagnosis, such as
bortezomib, lenalidomide or thalidomide, was initially rare but
increased from 1.1% to 6.6% during the study period (Figure 2).
Approximately 28% of patients with MM did not receive any
treatment within 1 year after diagnosis, possibly indicating SMM
or other conditions suggesting a poor candidate for therapy.

Trends in overall survival
Overall, 7139 patients who were newly diagnosed with MM during
2006–2012 were able to link with the social security administration
Master Death File. Patients younger than 65 years old at diagnosis
had better survival than those 65 years and older (Po0.01). 19.5%
of MM patients had a SCT during the same time period, with an
improved survival experience than those without SCT (Po0.01).
Furthermore, among these newly diagnosed patients who

received a MM treatment (n = 4902), patients treated with novel
therapies within 1 year of diagnosis showed significantly better
survival than those with only non-novel therapies (P = 0.01).
The survival disparity between MM patients and their matched
controls decreased substantially over time (Figure 3). A greater
proportion of MM patients survived for 2 years post diagnosis in
2012 (87.1%) than in 2006 (69.9%), whereas 2-year survival was
fairly consistent for matched control patients (93.9–97.4% during
2006–2012; Figure 4).
Trends in resource utilization and cost
Total PPPM all-cause healthcare costs increased from $3263 PPPM
in 2000 to $14 656 PPPM in 2014 among newly diagnosed MM
patients, which were primarily driven by costs of outpatient
services (Figure 5a). Costs attributable to outpatient services
increased from $1945 to $7200 PPPM from 2000 to 2014, but its
proportion of total healthcare costs decreased from 59.6% in 2000
to 49.1% in 2014. Outpatient services included a wide range of
healthcare utilizations such as emergency room, physician visits,
laboratory, radiology and infusion administration services. The
PPPM rates of emergency room visits increased from 0.14 in 2000
to 0.90 in 2014, contributing to PPPM costs growing from $21 to
$220 PPPM over the same time period.
In 2000, hospitalization costs accounted for 21.5% of total
healthcare costs, increasing to 32.7% in 2014. The PPPM
hospitalization rates steadily increased over the study period,
from 0.045 in 2000 to 0.109 in 2014, with parallel increase in
hospitalization costs from $701 to $4797 PPPM. Some of the
increase in hospitalization costs is likely due to the increased use
of SCT, which steadily increased from 0.027 per patient-year in
2000 to 0.090 in 2008 and 0.165 in 2014. In 2000, 4.3% of all

inpatient stays among MM patients included SCT, which increased
to 9.5% by 2014. Paralleling this increase in SCT incidence was a
marked increase in SCT-related costs, which was from $124 PPPM
in 2000 to $1612 PPPM in 2014.
Inpatient admissions for specific diagnoses and the associated
costs were also assessed. The hospitalization rate for sepsis or
infection-related hospitalization increased from 0.013 in 2000 to
0.038 PPPM in 2014, with associated costs increased from $209 to
$1782 PPPM. Likewise, the hospitalization rate for anemia or
neutropenia-related increased from 0.009 in 2000 to 0.070 PPPM
in 2014 with associated costs increased from $145 to $3970 PPPM.
The same trend was observed in the number of inpatient
admissions due to pathologic fracture, from 0.002 in 2000 to
0.014 PPPM in 2014, with corresponding costs increased from $36
to $695 PPPM.
MM treatment-related drug costs, including both outpatient
pharmacy prescriptions and office administered injectables, but
excluding SCT, were described. As shown in Figure 5b, MM
treatment-related drug costs increased from 2000 to 2014 at a rate
similar to but slower than total all-cause costs. MM treatment￾related drug costs accounted for 10.6% of total healthcare costs
among MM patients in 2000 ($346 PPPM), increasing to 20.3% in
2007 and 28.5% in 2014 ($4179 PPPM). Healthcare costs were also
compared between matched MM patients and their controls.
Monthly all-cause costs increased for both cases and controls over
the study period. Among matched MM patients, PPPM costs
increased from $3263 in 2000 to $15 546 (476%) in 2014,
compared with that in matched controls, which doubled from
$686 to $1255 (182%) over the same time period.
Subgroup analyses
To validate the robustness of the study findings, a subgroup
analysis was performed only among newly diagnosed MM
patients who actually received treatment within 1 year after
diagnosis. Among these patients, the percentage of deaths
decreased from 67.2% in 2006 to 21.4% in 2012 (a qualitatively
higher decrease than we found in the total MM population); in
addition, the percentage of patients who survived for 2 years post
diagnosis increased from 69.8% in 2006 to 86.1% in 2012, similar
to the findings from our primary analysis. The total PPPM all-cause
healthcare costs increased from $4412 PPPM in 2000 to $18 424
PPPM in 2014 among patients with MM treatment; similar in trend
to the main analysis, MM treatment-related drug costs increased
slower than total all-cause costs during the study period,
accounting for 9.4% of total healthcare costs in 2000 and 31.0%
in 2014.
DISCUSSION
This study is one of the first to describe the treatment patterns,
healthcare costs and overall survival among newly diagnosed
patients with MM over a span of 15 years using a large
administrative claims database that is expected to be representa￾tive of insured MM patients in the United States.2 Our study
showed that the total PPPM all-cause healthcare costs were high
for MM patients, which were mainly borne by the payer. The
increase in total healthcare costs has become greatly unaffordable
to patients with MM, their families and the society. The current
study period spans the approval of several novel therapies in MM
that have led to a changing treatment landscape over the last
decade.7 The impact of novel therapies has resulted in a paradigm
shift in the management of MM with substantially improved
outcomes, measured by both disease-free and overall survivability
of MM patients.8,9,14,15 Our analysis corroborates these findings as
overall survival was significantly improved across the index years.
Importantly, patients receiving novel therapies had better survival
outcomes compared with those who were managed with only
non-novel drugs from 2000 to 2014, without an overt reason to
believe that bias would favor the use of novel therapeutics by the
treating providers (for example, healthier patients). This improve￾ment was greater for patients diagnosed and treated after 2010
compared with those treated earlier.10 As expected, non-MM
control patients had substantially better survival outcomes than
MM patients treated, but the gap was significantly smaller for
patients diagnosed later in the study period.
The economic impact of novel therapies has become a concern
for cancer treatment in general16 and has been specifically
highlighted in MM.17,18 Although oncology treatment costs have
increased, our findings also suggest a steady but greater increase
in all-cause healthcare costs in other cost categories over the same
time period. We found that the costs attributable to the MM
treatment-related drugs increased slower than the costs of
Figure 4. Percentage of patients who survived at least 2 years between matched MM patients and controls. Note: by linking to the SSA Master
Death File, survival was measured as time from diagnosis date to the date of death obtained from the SSA, time from diagnosis date to the
date of inpatient death, or time from diagnosis date to 30 September 2015; survival rates are presented for multiple myeloma patients
diagnosed and treated during 2006–2012 (n=9521).

inpatient admission and outpatient services. In 2014, MM
treatment-related drug costs accounted for ~ 30% of the total
healthcare costs for MM patients, and increased only 5% from
2009 as a proportion of total costs despite new novel agents
coming to market in this time period. Consistent with prior
research documenting substantive costs associated with MM￾related comorbidities, such as bone and skeletal complications,19
this study demonstrated that the increase in the total PPPM costs
was driven, in part, by non-drug-related outpatient services and
inpatient admissions. One possibility is that this is also a reflection
of the improved longevity of patients with greater propensity to
develop complications due to improved life expectancy.
Ideally, discussions around medication value, particularly in
oncology, should take into account not only medication costs but
also other related healthcare costs and outcomes improvement.20–22
Our analysis quantifies increases in MM treatment-related drug
costs alongside a substantial increase in patient survival. Although
still present, the survival gap between MM patients and their
matched controls shrank considerably over the study period,
suggesting that MM patients’ life expectancy is close to that of
patients with other health problems. Where control patients were
1.34 times more likely to survive 2 years than their matched MM
patients diagnosed in 2006, this difference was reduced to 1.12
times for those diagnosed in 2012. In other words, MM patients
newly diagnosed in 2012 were 1.25 times more likely to survive 2
years than patients diagnosed in 2006. Likewise, compared with
2006, MM treatment-related drug costs increased by $2084 by
2012, whereas 2-year survival increased from 69.9% to 87.9%,

translating to an additional $121 PPPM per additional 1% increase in
2-year survival. To better evaluate the value of new MM treatments,
it is worthwhile to estimate life year gained using life expectancy or
similar metrics and determine the incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio in the future study, particularly when there is sufficient real￾world data on the latest wave of new novel therapies. Given the
recent advent of a number of new effective therapies in MM, this
analysis may now be forthcoming in the near future.
Despite the strength of the real-world data and direct matching,
this study had certain general limitations that are associated with
such claim based observational studies. First, this study was
limited to only those individuals with commercial health coverage
or private medicare supplemental coverage. Consequently, results
of this analysis may not be generalizable to patients with other
insurance or without health insurance coverage. Second, the
identification of MM population relied on diagnosis codes
recorded on medical claims and are therefore limited by
completeness and accuracy of medical coding. Third, this study
may underestimate total healthcare costs of MM patients given
that costs estimates only account for direct healthcare costs for
services reimbursed by commercial insurers. Indirect costs and
caregiver burden were not included because relevant data cannot
be captured from the claims database. We calculated resource
utilization and costs as PPPM with no inflation adjustment that
would give a greater value to older dollars, which might give the
appearance of flatter cost increases than were truly present.
Finally, the analysis did not include patient’s race or ethnicity
because relevant data cannot be captured from administrative
claims. However, previous studies have reported variations in
survival experience of MM patients by difference races;23 thereby,
it is worthwhile to control this variation in matching. Similarly, this
study could not control for MM disease severity, which is unlikely
but may have possibly changed over the study period and could
impact treatment patterns, costs and patient survival.
CONCLUSION
Newly diagnosed MM patients diagnosed after 2010 have better
survival outcomes than those diagnosed in earlier years. Total
healthcare costs among patients with newly diagnosed MM have
increased steadily since 2000; however, MM treatment-related
drug costs increased slower than other cost components and
remained a minority of total costs.
