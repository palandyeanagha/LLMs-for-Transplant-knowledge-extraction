While searching for derivatives of d-tubocura￾rine, Barlow and Ing (1) and Paton and Zaimis
(2) independently synthesized a series of poly￾methylene bistrimethylammonium salts. The lat￾ter investigators demonstrated that the pharma￾cological properties of this series were related to
the length of the polymethylene chain; the deca￾compound produced neuromuscular block while
the penta and hexa-compounds prevented the
transmission of impulses across the synapses in
all autonomic ganglia. They also carried out pre￾liminary trials in man (3) but Arnold and Rosen￾heim were the first to use these agents in hy￾pertension (4). Finally, Restall and Smirk
demonstrated that it was possible to reduce blood
pressure and obtain clinical improvement in hyper￾tensive patients for long periods by the use of
repeated parenteral doses of hexamethonium (5).
Studies in this laboratory have confirmed the
observations of Restall and Smirk and in addition
have shown the potentiating effect of 1-hydra￾zinophthalazine (Apresoline) when alternated
with doses of hexamethonium in patients with hy￾pertension (6, 7). Our studies also suggested that
hexamethonium may be useful in the treatment of

acute peripheral vascular disorders associated with
neurogenic vasospasm as well as in the evaluation
of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor component in
cases of peripheral vascular disease (8). Since
from these previous studies it appeared that hexa￾methonium was a potent agent both for reducing
blood pressure and increasing foot and digital
blood flow a more complete analysis of its hemo￾dynamic effects seemed indicated.
METHODS
The subjects were 25 hypertensive patients admitted
to the wards of Georgetown University Hospital and the
Veterans Administration Hospital and four normoten￾sive young males (medical students). Hexamethonium
was administered intravenously at a rate of 1 to 2 mg.

mg. per minute, in all instances until a significant hy￾potensive effect had been obtained or until 50 to 100 mg.
had been administered. All dosages refer to the amount
of hexamethonium ion administered.
The methods used in this investigation were essentially
similar to those described in a previous communication
(9), with the following exceptions: the determination of
arteriovenous oxygen difference were carried out using the
spectrophotometric method of Hickam and Frayser (10).
The oxygen content of the expired air was determined
using a Pauling type oxygen analyzer.5 The total
peripheral resistance was calculated according to the
method of Green, Lewis, Nickerson, and Heller (11).
In the muscle blood flow experiments it was necessary to
estimate the mean arterial pressure from the values for
systolic and diastolic pressure as determined by the
auscultatory method. The formula used was as follows:
mean arterial pressure = .436 (pulse pressure) + diastolic
pressure (12). Calf blood flow was measured as previ￾ously described except that a strain gage,6 with a car￾6 Model C, Arnold 0. Beckman, Inc., South Pasadena,

RESULTS
I. Cardiac function
Cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and total
peripheral resistance
The changes in cardiac output and total periph￾eral resistance seemed to vary with the state of
cardiac compensation. In the hypertensive pa￾tient with a compensated heart the usual response
to hypotensive doses of hexamethonium was a
slight decrease in cardiac output. Thus, in 11 post￾treatment analyses carried out in six patients with￾out heart failure the cardiac output decreased by 6
to 38 per cent (mean 22.0 per cent, S.D. 9.3)
(Table I, Cases 1 through 6). The decrease in
mean arterial pressure was of similar magnitude
varying from 10 to 37 per cent (mean 23.5 per
cent, S.D. 7.0). In only one instance did the ar￾terial pressure fall to normotensive levels. The
total peripheral resistance did not change signifi￾cantly varying between + 19 and - 22 per cent
(mean - 1.3 per cent).
In contrast, in four additional patients with
congestive heart failure and one with malignant
hypertension there was a significant increase in
cardiac output in three and a slight increase in
two patients following hexamethonium. The
range for nine post-treatment determination was
+ 3 to 100 per cent and the mean 38 per cent,
S.D. 35.4 (Table I, Cases 7 through 11). In
these instances the total peripheral resistance fell
significantly the range being 27 to 70 per cent
and the mean 47 per cent, S.D. 14.1.
Other aspects of cardiac function
The heart rate usually increased moderately after
hexamethonium. There were insignificant changes
in rate in three patients, slowing in one and rises in
six cases; the average increase was 14 beats per
minute (Table I).
Pressures on the right side of the circulation
were measured in seven patients and decreased in
all instances. In the group with compensated

hearts the pulmonary arterial pressure decreased
in patient W. C. from 26/14 to 14/8 mm. Hg. In
patient B. J. the right ventricular pressure de￾creased from 38/12 to 22/4 mm. Hg (Figure 1).
In subject C. A., the mean right auricular pres￾sure decreased from - 0.5 to - 2.5 mm. Hg. In
the decompensated patients the pulmonary ar￾terial pressure decreased in patient T. P. from
45/22 to 20/12 mm. Hg and in subject R. S. from
70/40 to 40/15 mm. Hg. The right ventricular
pressures fell in subject J. C. from 115/25 to 85/18
mm. Hg and in subject A. C. from 130/20 to 80/8
mm. Hg. The decline in right heart pressures
paralleled the fall in systemic arterial pressure.
II. Blood Flow Through Various Regions
Blood flow through the muscles (calf blood flow)
In a previous communication it was pointed out
that a ten-fold increase in foot (primarily skin)
blood flow occurred after hexamethonium (14).
In the calf segment (primarily muscle) an in￾creased blood flow as determined by the plethysmo￾graphic method also was observed but to a much
smaller degree than that observed in the foot
(Table II).
Ten hypertensive patients were studied. Two
patients in the malignant phase had previous ther￾apy with hexamethonium while the remaining
eight were patients with essential hypertension
who had received no previous treatment with
hexamethonium. In the latter eight cases all ex￾hibited an increase of muscle blood flow varying
from 11 to 61 per cent (mean 39.4 per cent) of
the control values. The crude peripheral resist￾ance decreased by 26 to 56 per cent (mean 40.4
per cent). The increase of blood flow began simul￾taneously with the decrease of blood pressure and
some increase persisted for at least an hour.
The two patients who had malignant hyperten￾sion and who had been under continuous dosages
of hexamethonium immediately prior to testing
showed a decrease of blood flow in one instance
and no change in the other. It could not be deter￾mined from this limited data whether these atypi￾cal responses were associated with the development
of tolerance to the vasodilating properties of the
drug or represented a response peculiar to patients
in the malignant phase of hypertension.

HEXAMETHONIUM: HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS
FIG. 1. CUTTINGS TAKEN FROM THE RECORDINGS OF SYSTEMIC ARTERIAL (ABoVE)
AND RIGHT VENTRICULAR PRESSURES (BELOW) IN PATIENT B. J. BEFORE AND 19
MINUTES AFTER THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF 30 MG. OF HEXAMETHONIUM
The reduction of arterial pressure was accompanied by a considerable decrease of
right ventricular pressure. See text and Table I for further details.
Blood flow through the hepatic-portal circuit
Determinations of estimated hepatic-portal blood
flow were carried out in five hypertensive and two
normal subjects. In all of the hypertensive pa￾tients the mean arterial pressure decreased follow￾ing hexamethonium, the range being 20 to 40 per
cent and the mean 28 per cent (Table III). In
four cases estimated hepatic blood flow decreased
by 8 to 54 per cent (mean 25 per cent) while in
the remaining case it was unchanged. The he￾patic-portal vascular resistance fell in all except
one of the hypertensive patients.
One of the normal subjects exhibited insignifi￾cant changes in estimated hepatic portal flow and
peripheral vascular resistance while in the remain￾ing subject hepatic blood flow decreased 19 per
cent and peripheral resistance also was reduced
slightly. Thus in four or five hypertensive and
one of two normotensive subjects the estimated
hepatic portal blood flow decreased moderately
and in the remaining two cases did not change sig￾nificantly.
Blood flow through the kidneys
Two of the seven cases studied exhibited no sig￾nificant change in renal blood flow (D. G. and
H. B., Table IV). However, changes in arterial
pressure also were insignificant in these two sub￾jects despite relatively high doses of hexametho￾nium. In the remaining five cases there was a re￾duction of renal plasma flow which paralleled the
fall in arterial pressure (Table IV and Figure 2).
However, in four of these cases all of whom were
hypertensives, the renal plasma flow returned to
or above the control levels after periods varying
from 15 to 50 minutes following the time of drug
administration. In all four instances the plasma
flow rose despite a continued significant reduction
of arterial pressure. In the remaining case, a nor￾mal subject, the plasma flow remained reduced up
to 50 minutes after hexamethonium. Thus, the
usual pattern of response to hypotensive doses of
hexamethonium was an early decrease in renal
plasma flow followed by a return to control values
despite continued reduction of arterial pressure.

FIG. 2. CHART OF EFFECTIVE RENAL PLASMA FLOW, GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE,
FILTRATION FRACTION, URINE VOLUME AND ARTERIAL PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER THE
INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF 40 MG. OF HEXAMETHONIUM ION IN PATIENT A. Z.
In the early period there was a decrease in renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration
rate and urine volume. However, 45 minutes after hexamethonium renal plasma flow
had returned to and glomerular filtration rate approached control values despite con￾tinued significant reduction in filtration fraction, urine volume and arterial pressure.
III. Other Aspects of Renal Function
Glomerular filtration rate was determined in
six of the subjects listed in Table IV. In three
hypertensive patients there was a reduction of
glomerular filtration rate followed by a rise to￾ward but not to the control values (A. Z., A. S.,
and M. Y., Table IV and Figure 2). In one hy￾pertensive and one normal subject there was a
continued fall in glomerular filtration rate through￾out the experimental period. The final normal
subject who had exhibited no significant change
in arterial pressure or renal blood flow also
showed no change in glomerular filtration rate.
It was apparent, therefore, that the rate of glo￾merular filtration decreased paralleling the blood
pressure fall and complete compensation usually
did not occur during the experimental period. The
filtration fraction decreased in all of the hyperten￾sive patients. In the two normal subjects there
was no significant change in the patient who
showed no reduction of arterial pressure and a
slight rise in filtration fraction in the other.
The volume of urine flow did not change in the
two cases who exhibited insignificant reduction
of arterial pressure (D. G. and H. B., Table IV).
Four of the five remaining cases exhibited a reduc￾tion of urine volume which persisted throughout
the experimental period. The final patient (C. S.)
exhibited a slight rise in urine volume.
DISCUSSION
Previous hemodynamic studies in this labora￾tory demonstrated that hexamethonium produces
a marked to complete abolition of such vasocon￾strictor reflexes as the vasopressor "overshoot"
following the Valsalva maneuver, the cold pres￾1294

HEXAMETHONIUM: HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS
sor response and the reflex vasoconstrictions to
"noxious" stimuli as determined by digital plethys￾mography (15). As would be expected following
such inhibition of moderator reflexes by a gangli￾onic blocking agent the pressor responses to epi￾nephrine and norepinephrine were augmented con￾siderably, after as compared to before, hexametho￾nium (16). In a constant temperature cold room
the increase in foot blood flow was as great fol￾lowing hexamethonium as after extradural or
intrathecal anesthesia in normal subjects, suggest￾ing nearly complete ganglionic blockade in man
(14). In addition, probably by reason of the
inhibition of vasoconstrictor reflexes, hexametho￾nium was found to induce marked hypotension in
normal or hypertensive subjects following minor
degrees of blood loss such as that occasioned by
the brief application of venous tourniquets to the
extremities or by small venesections of 250 to 500
cc. of blood (17). Thus, the previous studies dem￾onstrated that hexamethonium in man interferes
with transmission of sympathetic vasoconstrictor
impulses more completely than any previously
known agent. The present investigation has de￾termined the effects of such widespread inhibition
of sympathetic impulses on cardiovascular dy￾namics.
In the patients who did not exhibit congestive
heart failure and whose cardiac outputs were in
the normal range, the hypotensive response to
hexamethonium was accompanied by a decreased
cardiac output and little or no change in total
peripheral resistance. These observations are
in approximate agreement with those of Werko,
Frisk, Wade, and Eliasch (18), but are opposed
to those of Gilmore, Kopelman, McMichael, and
Milne (19) who found essentially no change in
cardiac output after hexamethonium. Thus, the,
reduction of arterial pressure in the present series
seemed to be secondary to a diminished cardiac
output rather than to arteriolar vasodilation. The
decreased cardiac output in turn appeared to be
due to a failure of venous return since the pres￾sures on the right side of the circulation were re￾duced uniformly.
The failure of venous return probably was pro￾duced by pooling of blood in the peripheral circu￾lation. Such pooling could be due to (1) an in￾crease in the total vascular capacity, and (2) the
blockade of reflex vasoconstrictor responses (17).
By contrast in the patients with congestive heart
failure or malignant hypertension the decreases
in systemic and right heart pressures were ac￾companied by an increased cardiac output and de￾creased total peripheral resistance. These di￾vergent observations in the patients with heart
failure as compared to compensated subjects may
be explained, however, in the light of the following
considerations: first, in the case of the heart fail￾ure subjects the peripheral pooling of blood in￾duced by hexamethonium would act like a vene￾section reducing the loading pressure of the con￾gested right side of the heart thereby facilitating
its recovery. Second, it is evident that pa￾tients with this type of heart failure are in a
state of elevated vasoconstrictor tone since nor￾mal or elevated levels of systemic arterial pressure
are maintained despite a cardiac output which
usually is reduced. Hexamethonium by its block￾ing action on vasoconstrictor reflexes abolishes
this increased tone thus permitting a decrease in
total peripheral resistance and thereby also in the
demand for cardiac work. These considerations
and their implications in regard to the nature of
congestive heart failure have been discussed more
fully in another communication (20).
Muscle blood flows increased only moderately,
while renal and hepatic-portal blood flows fell
during the maximum action of the drug. Foot
blood flow increased approximately ten fold (14)
but since this vascular area is small in relation to
the total vasculature the decrease in vascular re￾sistance in the foot had little influence on the total
peripheral resistance. These results suggest that
there is an uneven distribution of sympathetic
vasocontrictor nerves in different vascular areas.
Only in a single region, the distal parts of the ex￾tremities, was a marked increase in flow observed.
In the other and larger vascular areas (muscles,
hepatic-portal and renal vascular beds) moderate
increases or actual decreases in flow occurred
while the total peripheral resistance usually was
only slightly reduced. These data do not sup￾port the view that the sympathetic vasoconstric￾tor system is of great importance in regulating
arteriolar tone in the resting, supine subject ex￾cept for its role in temperature regulation of the
skin particularly of the distal parts of the extremi￾ties. The results also emphasize the fallacies in￾herent in drawing conclusions as to the overall

vasodilating effects of agents which increase skin
temperature, color or blood flow.
The hemodynamic effects of hexamethonium,
however, are due to more than simple inhibition
of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves since the
drug interferes with transmission through all
autonomic ganglia. Vasodilator nerves which
synapse in the ganglia as well as vasoconstrictor
impulses will be inhibited. For example, blockade
of vasodilator impulses is seen in the cessation of
salivary flow following the drug (21). Thus, the
results observed after hexamethonium may be in
reality the net effect of combined inhibition of
autonomic vasoconstrictor and vasodilator im￾pulses.
The pattern of change in renal function was
qualitatively similar to that observed after certain
other hypotensive agents including veratrum viride
(9), the dihydrogenated alkaloids of ergot (22)
and sodium nitrite given as a single, oral dose (23).
The renal vasculature did not share in the decrease
in vascular resistance associated with the fall in
arterial pressure. This is indicated by the fact
that the renal plasma flow decreased sharply at
the onset of the hypotensive response regardless
of the drug used. However, as the arterial pres￾sure stabilized at a lower level or began to rise
the resistance of the renal vessels decreased to per￾mit a return to normal rates of plasma flow. This
effect, which was first observed by Smith and his
co-workers folowing spinal anaesthesia, has been
interpreted by him as indicating an autonomy of
the renal arterioles (24).
A recent study by Machinnon indicated that the
closely related compound, pentamethonium pro￾duced a decrease in renal blood flow in both nor￾motensive and hypertensive subjects (25). How￾ever, the design of his experiments was such that
only the early hypotensive response to the drug
was studied. Thus, insufficient time was allowed
to permit observation of the later return of renal
plasma flow to control levels. Mills, Moyer, and
Handley found no change in renal clearances fol￾lowing hexamethonium in normal subjects but
observed some diminution in hypertensive patients
(26).
As a result of the percentally greater fall in
glomerular filtration rate than in plasma flow there
was a decrease in filtration fraction which in hy￾pertensive subjects approached normal values.
The urine during this period became quite con￾centrated suggesting that tubular function was
not significantly impaired. This pattern of change
has been observed with hypotensive agents of all
types tested in this laboratory (23) and therefore
probably is secondary to the sudden alteration of
arterial pressure rather than to any specific action
of individual drugs on the kidney.
From the point of view of effects on hemody￾namics the response to hexamethonium does not
appear to be entirely desirable. Thus, cardiac
output may decrease, renal clearances especially
glomerular filtration rate fall at least temporarily
and homeostatic, vasomotor reflexes are seriously
compromised. However, despite these apparently
undesirable. and abnormal acute actions, the clini￾cal response to hexamethonium frequently has
appeared to be beneficial (5, 7, 8). These corre￾lative clinical and experimental studies empha￾size the fact that the results of hemodynamic analy￾sis need not always indicate the desirability of a
given agent in clinical practice where other fac￾tors may determine the usefulness of the drug.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Hexamethonium administered to hypertensive
and normal subjects produces the following hemo￾dynamic effects.:
1. In hypertensive patients who do not have
cardiac decompensation the reduction of systemic
arterial pressure is accompanied by a decrease in
right heart pressures and cardiac output. The total
peripheral resistance does riot change significantly.
It is suggested that these alterations are the re￾sult of a combination of "venous pooling" and fail￾ure of reflex vasoconstriction.
2. In patients with heart failure the fall in sys￾temic arterial pressure appears to be accompanied
by a reduction of right heart pressures, an in￾crease in cardiac output and a significant decrease
in total peripheral resistance. These alterations
may be due to unloading of the congested right
side of the heart as well as to inhibition of vasocon￾strictor reflexes activated by the low output heart
failure.
3. In contrast to the marked increase in blood
flow in the foot observed previously, blood flow
through the muscles increases only moderately.
Since the arterial pressure falls after hexametho￾1296

HEXAMETHONIUM: HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS
nium a significant decrease in peripheral resistance
is assumed to occur in this area.
4. Despite a moderate reduction of hepatic vas￾cular resistance estimated hepatic-portal blood flow
usually decreases after hexamethonium.
5. Renal plasma flow decreases paralleling the
initial fall in arterial pressure and then rises to ap￾proximate control levels despite a continued hypo￾tensive response. This is consistent with previous
observations indicating an autonomy of tone of the
renal arterioles.
6. In most cases the changes in glomerular fil￾tration rate follow a pattern similar to the altera￾tions in renal plasma flow, but occasionally filtra￾tion may remain below control values. Oliguria
with increased concentration of urine usually oc￾curs. All of these renal effects begin to diminish
after 30 to 60 minutes despite continued signifi￾cant hypotension.
7. The studies to date suggest that sympathetic
vasoconstrictor nerves blocked by hexamethonium
exert the controlling influence on homeostatic ad￾justments to postural change as well as in main￾taining the tone of the vessels of the distal part
of the extremities. However, in resting supine
subjects such nerves appear to exert a much less
important influence on arteriolar tone in the he￾patic-portal, renal and muscle areas.
