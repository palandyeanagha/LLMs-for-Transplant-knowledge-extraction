Class I and class II major histocompatibility
complex antigens on hepatocytes: Importance of
the method of detection and expression in
histologically normal and diseased livers
G Senaldi, A Lobo-Yeo, A P Mowat, G Mieli-Vergani, D Vergani
Abstract
Methodological differences in major his￾tocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen
detection were investigated on isolated,
viable hepatocytes and cryostat hepatic
sections from 27 children with liver dis￾orders, six of whom had normal his￾tology. Class I antigens were constantly
found on sections using a three step
immunoperoxidase technique after
acetone/chloroform fixation, other tech￾niques being less sensitive, or on isolated
hepatocytes by indirect immunofluores￾cence alone. With mechanical isolation
the percentage of positivity ranged from
85 to 100%, while with collagenase iso￾lation it ranged from 22 to 49% on
immediate testing, and from 53 to 80%
after 24 hour incubation. Class II
antigens were only detected in one
patient with autoimmune chronic active
hepatitis and two with primary scleros￾ing cholangitis. Flow cytofluorimetric
analysis in 11 cases confirmed class II or
class I positivity, or both, on isolated
hepatocytes, allowing MHC antigen
expression on hepatocytes to be
measured.
Class I and II antigen detection on
hepatocytes is influenced by the tech￾nique used. Although class I antigens are
invariably expressed on hepatocytes,
class II antigens are only found on
hepatocytes from patients with immune
mediated liver disorders.

Class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (HLA￾DR) antigens are products of the major his￾tocompatibility complex (MHC): they have a
central role in the induction and control of the
immune response.1
Class I antigens are reported to be present
on all nucleated cells while class II antigens
only occur on limited cell populations, such as
monocytes and macrophages, B cells, and
activated T cells.2" Recent studies, however,
have challenged these notions. Class I
antigens have been shown to have a more
restricted distribution than originally pos￾tulated, not being observed on corneal
endothelium, epithelial cells of exocrine pan￾creas, and endocrine and nervous cells. They
are also expressed with variable intensity in
different tissues.56 Conversely, it has been
shown that class II antigens are more widely
expressed in tissues than was previously
thought, being found on endothelial cells and
a variety of epithelial cells.78 In some disor￾ders de novo class II antigen expression might
enable cells, otherwise not normally involved
in the immune response, to perform antigen
presenting cell functions."2
There are conflicting data on the expression
of class I antigens on normal human
hepatocytes; some investigators have been
unable to detect these molecules,5 '135 while
others have, albeit at low density.61"19 There
is, however, consensus about the lack of class
II antigens on normal hepatocytes.78 14 15 17 18
The expression of class I and II antigens
on hepatocytes from patients with several
liver diseases, particularly those considered
to have an immune component to their
pathogenesis, has been intensively investi￾gated recently. "" 17 1920-28 While class I
antigens have been consistently detected,
especially in areas of liver damage such as
piecemeal necrosis and spotty necrosis, the
degree of class II antigen expression is dis￾puted.'4 15242628 The published results are not
strictly comparable, because they have been
obtained with different techniques. Major dif￾ferences in tissue manipulation, choice of
reagents, fixation procedures and staining
protocols are evident in these studies. This
raises the question of the degree to which
results regarding the expression of MHC
antigens on hepatocytes are influenced by the
methods chosen.
To address this problem we investigated six
histologically normal and 21 diseased liver
biopsy specimens from children using the
most widely applied methods to detect class I
and II antigens. We compared the results
obtained using these techniques with those
obtained by immunofluorescence staining of
viable hepatocytes that had been freshly
isolated from the same biopsy specimens.
Methods
Percutaneous liver biopsy specimens were
obtained from 24 children (14 males and 10
females, median age 2 years, range 2 months￾16 years). The specimens were taken with a
1-4 mm diameter Menghini needle. Only
material not required for purposes of clinical
management was used in this study and con￾sisted of 5-10 mm long liver cylinders. Biopsy

specimens were taken from four patients with
no histological abnormalities (two with Crig￾gler-Najjar's syndrome, one with ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency, and one four
months after recovery from Reye's syn￾drome); four with ot-1-antitrypsin deficiency
(protease inhibitor ZZ phenotype); four with
extrahepatic biliary atresia; three with
idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; two with
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); two
after liver transplantation (one with acute
rejection and one with acute cholangitis); and
one with each of the following: HBsAg and
HBeAg positive chronic persistent hepatitis;
HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative cirrhosis
with minimal hepatitis; autoimmune chronic
active hepatitis (CAH); Alagille's syndrome;
and glycogen storage disease type IX. Surgical
biopsy specimens were obtained from two
children, both female, aged 6 and 7 months.
One was undergoing surgery for hepatoblas￾toma and her biopsy specimen comprised a
piece of histologically normal liver surround￾ing the resected lesion. The other was under￾going the Kasai operation as treatment for
extrahepatic biliary atresia. Liver tissue was
also obtained from a 15 year old organ donor
whose liver could not be used for transplanta￾tion because the recipient had died during
surgery.
The biopsy specimens were divided into
equal pieces immediately after collection.
Two pieces were recovered with the purpose
of comparing the methods for the detection of
MHC antigens on isolated hepatocytes with
those for hepatocytes in liver sections. One
was immersed in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco
Europe, Uxbridge, England) containing 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco Europe) and
20 mmol/I of EDTA; the other was embedded
in OCT medium (BDH, Poole, Dorset) and
stored in liquid nitrogen until use. To com￾pare MHC antigen expression on the mechan￾ically isolated hepatocytes with that on
hepatocytes isolated enzymatically, a third
piece was cut from five biopsy specimens and
placed in RPMI containing 10% FCS and
0 01% collagenase type IV (Sigma UK).
IMMUNOLOGICAL REAGENTS
Three murine IgG2a monoclonal antibodies
were used: W6/32 directed against a mono￾morphic determinant on class I antigens29;
L243 directed against a monomorphic deter￾minant of class II antigens30; and BE3F9
directed against bovine insulin as control
antibody.3' These antibodies were recovered
from the supernatant of cultured hybridomas,
obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, Maryland, USA) and
grown for one to two weeks in RPMI with 2%
FCS at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmos￾phere. The antibodies were purified by
protein A affinity chromatography and stored
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7 2)
containing 0 5% bovine serum albumin and
0-01% sodium azide at an approximate con￾centration of 100 Mg/ml.
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin
F(ab')2 fragment, peroxidase-conjugated
rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin anti￾serum, and peroxidase-conjugated swine anti￾rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum were the
antisera used (all purchased from Dakopatts,
High Wycombe, England).
Immunological reagents were used at
saturating concentrations determined in
preliminary titration experiments.
DETECTION OF CLASS I AND II ANTIGENS ON
LIVER SECTIONS
Thirty six serial 5 ,um thick sections were cut
from all frozen liver samples in an OTF/AS
cryostat (Bright, Runcorn, England) on to
polylysine coated slides and air dried for three
to six hours. Twelve combinations of different
fixation and staining procedures were then
used.
The 36 sections were divided into four
groups of nine: nine were fixed by immersion
in a 1 in 1 acetone/chloroform mixture for five
minutes21 24; nine were fixed in acetone for 10
minuteS136831425; nine were fixed in ethanol for
15 minutes28; nine were left unfixed. All the
sections were washed extensively in PBS,
treated with 0 3% H202 in PBS for 20 min￾utes to block endogenous peroxidase, washed
again and incubated with PBS containing
10% normal rabbit serum and 10% normal
swine serum to block sites of non-specific
binding.
The nine sections within each group were
then assembled in three sets of three, and each
section in a set was incubated for 30 minutes
with either anti-class I, anti-class II, or con￾trol monoclonal antibody, diluted 1 in 40, 1 in
80, and 1 in 40, respectively, to achieve
optimal staining. After washing for 15 min￾utes in three changes of PBS one set within
each group was treated with FITC-con￾jugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin
F(ab')2 fragment and the other two with
peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
immunoglobulin, both diluted 1 in 20 in PBS
containing 5% normal human AB serum to
block cross reactivity with human immun￾oglobulin. After washing as above the sections
stained for indirect immunofluorescence were
mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS and
examined under ultraviolet microscopy. One
of the two remaining sets of the peroxidase
reaction was developed by the addition of PBS
containing diaminobenzidine (0-6 mg/ml) and
H202 (0-03%) according to a standard
procedure, rinsed in tap water, counterstained
with Mayer's haematoxylin, mounted in
glycerol/PBS and examined under light
microscopy. The remaining set was further
incubated with peroxidase-conjugated swine
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin diluted 1 in 20 in
PBS containing 5% normal human AB serum
and the peroxidase reaction was developed as
above.
Expression of MHC antigens on
hepatocytes was graded by a single observer
unaware of clinical data using a semiquan￾titative scale as follows: 0 = negative;

DETECTION OF CLASS I AND II ANTIGENS ON
ISOLATED HEPATOCYTES
Isolation of hepatocytes
Isolated, viable hepatocytes were prepared by
mechanical or enzymatic dispersion of the
liver biopsy specimens, as previously des￾cribed.32
For the mechanical isolation of hepatocytes,
the portion of biopsy specimen collected in
RPMI supplemented with EDTA was teased
apart using two 19 gauge needles in a small
Petri dish. The disrupted tissue was suspen￾ded in RPMI and filtered through nylon wool
("Leuko-Pak", Travenol, Thetford, England)
to eliminate large clumps of cells and debris.
The filtrate was then centrifuged at 100g for
five minutes, the pellet resuspended in a drop
of RPMI, and the hepatocytes counted.
Hepatocytes could be distinguished from
other cellular components by virtue of their
characteristic cytological features: they are
large and often polygonal and possess a small
nucleolous, which is frequently duplicated,
and abundant granular cytoplasm. The cell
yield ranged from 2 to 6 x 104 hepatocytes.
Hepatocyte viability was consistently between
60% and 80%, as assessed using Trypan￾blue. Hepatocytes thus prepared were tested
immediately.
For the enzymatic isolation of hepatocytes,
the portion of biopsy specimen collected in
RPMI containing collagenase was incubated
in the same medium for three hours at 37°C
under constant agitation. The disrupted tissue
was filtered and washed and the hepatocyte
number and viability assessed as described
above. Values were similar to those obtained
after mechanical isolation. About half of the
hepatocytes yielded by enzymatic disruption
were tested immediately; the remainder were
incubated in RPMI with 10% FCS for 24
hours at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmos￾phere and stained.
Microscopic analysis
Isolated hepatocytes were stained in suspen￾sion using a two step indirect immunofluores￾cence technique. Hepatocytes were adjusted to
a final concentration of 5-15 x 103 cells in
100 pl of RPMI. Three such preparations were
obtained from each disruption experiment
and also from the hepatocytes incubated for
24 hours after enzymatic disruption. The
hepatocyte suspension was incubated with 5 MI
of anti-class I, anti-class II, or control mono￾clonal antibody for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed
twice by centrifugation in RPMI at 100 x g,
resuspended in about 100 MI of medium and
incubated with 5 jul of FITC-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragment
for 30 minutes at 4°C. After washing, the cells
were resuspended in a drop of RPMI and
examined using an ultraviolet microscope
(Polyvar, Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria).
In five cases, where sufficient biopsy
material was available, mechanically isolated
hepatocytes were also stained as a cytospin
preparation using a two step indirect immuno￾peroxidase technique. Hepatocytes, resus￾pended as above in 100 jul of RPMI, were
centrifuged (Shandon-Elliott, Runcorn,
England) at 100 x g for three minutes on a
slide precoated with 0 01% poly-l-lysine
(Sigma) in distilled water. A cytospin for each
of the three monoclonal antibodies was
prepared, air dried for one hour, fixed in
acetone for 10 minutes, and then processed as
described for immunoperoxidase staining of
liver sections.
FLOW CYTOFLUORIMETRIC ANALYSIS
In a preliminary experiment cells isolated from
the liver of the organ donor were analysed by
flow cytofluorimetry using a Facstar (Becton
Dickinson, Oxford, England). The standard
three parameter protocol of forward angle and
wide angle light scattering and green fluores￾cence was used. A discrete cell population was
identified, sorted, and analysed (fig IA). To
assess its purity, a cytospin preparation of this
population was stained with haematoxylin and
eosin and shown to be composed exclusively of
hepatocytes (fig iB).
Flow cytofluorimetric analysis was then
used in 11 cases in which adequate numbers
of indirect immunofluorescence stained
hepatocytes had remained after examination

fluorescence intensity of the hepatocyte
populations was analysed and the median
fluorescence intensity calculated and expressed
in log transformed arbitrary units using the

Wokingham, England) connected with the flow

Results
EXPRESSION OF CLASS I AND II ANTIGENS ON LIVER
SECTIONS
Tables 1 and 2 summarise the results for the
expression of class I and II antigens on liver
sections, as detected using different combina￾tions of fixation and staining procedures.
Hepatocytes expressing class I antigens were
found in all the patients studied only when the
three step immunoperoxidase technique after
fixation in acetone/chloroform was used. Con￾siderable variations in the sensitivity of class I
detection were observed between the indirect
immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase
methods, and among the different fixation
procedures. Independently of the type of fixa￾tion, immunoperoxidase staining proved more
sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence,
permitting both the detection of a higher
number of positive patients and higher scores
of staining intensity. When immunoperoxidase
staining was performed in three steps, higher
sensitivities were obtained, and in two patients
with histologically normal liver, one of whom
was the organ donor, only the application of
three step immunoperoxidase after fixation in
acetone/chloroform allowed class I antigens on
hepatocytes in liver sections to be detected (figs
2A-C). On unfixed liver sections, stained by
indirect immunofluorescence, two step im￾munoperoxidase or three step immuno￾peroxidase, class I antigens were identified in
only a minority of the cases which gave positive
results on isolated hepatocytes. The acetone/
chloroform mixture proved better than ethanol

sensitivity, but also better preservation of the
liver tissue. The staining for class I and II
antigens using acetone/chloroform fixation of
the liver section from a liver transplant
recipient with acute rejection is shown in figs
3A-B.
Class II antigens were detected on liver
sections from the patient with autoimmune
chronic active hepatitis and one of the two
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis,
either by indirect immunofluorescence or two
or three step immunoperoxidase (fig 4). Class II
antigens, however, were not observed on any of
the histological preparations from the other
patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis,
although they had been detected on the isolated
hepatocytes.
Major histocompatibility complex antigen
expression, whether class I or class II, was
always detected both on the membrane and,
though much more weakly, in the cytoplasm.
Stronger cytoplasmic staining was observed on
the liver sections left unfixed; on these sections,
however, a high background staining was also
found using the irrelevant control monoclonal
antibody. According to the number of stained
hepatocytes and to the intensity of the staining
itself, the pattern of positivity ranged from a
faint and scattered form to a strong and diffuse
reticular (honeycomb) pattem (fig 5A-B). In
autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and
primary sclerosing cholangitis expression of
class I and II antigens was stronger on the
hepatocytes at the periphery of the hepatic
lobule than in those occupying a central posi￾tion (fig 6).

positively stained for class I antigens, and in the
remaining 18 between 50% and 99% of the
hepatocytes were positive (median 96%). The
six histologically normal patients had values
between 58% and 97% (median 93%). In all
cases the staining pattern was linear along the

fluorescence intensity were noticed from

patients 100% of the hepatocytes were positive
for class I antigens, the fluorescence staining
being particularly strong in 10-90% (median
45%) of the cells.
In the five subjects in whom both mechanical
and enzymatic disruption were performed, the
use of collagenase resulted in a reduction of the
percentage of cells expressing class I, which in
four cases increased again after 24 hour culture
(table 3).
Class II antigens were absent on the isolated
hepatocytes from all subjects, apart from those
with primary sclerosing cholangitis and
autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, in whom
10%, 20%, and 90% of hepatocyte positivity,
respectively, were found (table 1). The staining
had a linear pattern along the hepatocyte
membrane (fig 8), as observed for class I
antigens, and in the case of autoimmune
chronic active hepatitis a strong fluorescence
intensity was seen.
No positive hepatocyte staining was detected
in any of the patients by using the control
monoclonal antibody.
Flow cytofluorimetry
All 11 cases analysed by flow cytofluorimetry
were positive for class I antigen expression.
Flow cytofluorimetric analysis confirmed the
lower fluorescence intensity of enzymatically
prepared liver cells when compared with
mechanically isolated ones and their increase
in fluorescence intensity after 24 hour culture
(fig 9).
The child with autoimmune chronic active
hepatitis and the only child with primary
sclerosing cholangitis tested by flow cyto￾fluorimetry were also positive for class II
antigens (fig 10).
Hepatocytes stained using the control mono￾clonal antibody showed a low fluorescence
intensity, which was indistinguishable from
autofluorescence.
Discussion
This study shows that the detection of class I
and class II antigens on human hepatocytes is

the most sensitive results are obtained by
staining in suspension mechanically isolated
hepatocytes with an indirect immunofluores￾cence technique. It also shows the feasibility of
analysing and quantifying the expression of
surface molecules by flow cytofluorimetry,
such as MHC antigens, on a pure population of
hepatocytes.

the highest number of positive cases and the
strongest staining intensity. Unfixed liver sec￾tions proved a poor substrate for staining,
possibly because of bad preservation of the
liver tissue, so that even the strong expression
of class I and II antigens on non-parenchymal
cells was difficult to visualise. Furthermore,
the background staining was high and genuine
membrane staining was hard to detect. It has
been suggested that staining for MHC antigens
is greatly decreased in fixed cryostat liver
sections, when compared with unfixed sec￾tions.26 The observation that cytoplasmic stain￾ing was seen on unfixed liver sections when an
irrelevant control monoclonal antibody was
used suggests that, on the contrary, unfixed
liver tissue reacts non-specifically with the
protein reagents with which it is incubated.
In detecting class I and II antigens on liver
sections, immunoperoxidase gave a stronger
positive staining, combined with a weaker
background, than immunofluorescence,
enhancing the detection of the targeted
membrane antigens. In one case it was possible
to detect class I antigens on hepatocytes
in liver sections only when using a three step
immunoperoxidase technique, and, overall, the
staining intensity was the highest using this
technique. Thus the additional sensitivity
introduced by the use of a second peroxidase￾conjugated reagent may be the determining
factor in some cases for the successful detection
of MHC antigens. Given the other general
advantages of immunoperoxidase over immuno￾fluorescence, such as the permanence of stain￾ing and compatibility with counterstaining that
permits simultaneous histological analysis, this
seems to be the method of choice to investigate
presence and distribution of MHC antigens in
liver sections.

hepatocytes in suspension proved the most

sensitive technique to determine membrane
expression of MHC antigen, as evidenced by
the case of primary sclerosing cholangitis in
which class II antigens were identified by
immunofluorescence staining of isolated
hepatocytes, but not by any of the other
histological techniques used.
A further advan￾tage is the relative rapidity of this technique.
This method also provides the opportunity for
counting the positively stained hepatocytes and
of analysing them by flow cytofluorimetry, so
that an objective visual representation of the
fluorescence intensity range can be derived and
the median fluorescence intensity calculated.
Class
I antigen expression on enzymatically
isolated hepatocytes has been previously repor￾ted on a small number of biopsy specimens,'7
although no attempt was made to quantify the
positivity. An important new finding of our
study is that enzymatically isolated hepatocytes
show
a reversible decrease in class
I expression.
The fact that after 24 hour culture the same
hepatocytes reacquire class
I antigens indicates
that hepatocytes have the intrinsic ability to
synthetise and express these molecules on their
membrane in vitro. The percentage of positive
cells remained, however, lower than that
obtained by mechanical disruption, suggesting
that the action of collagenase may interfere
with the preservation of intact molecules, such
as MHC antigens, exposed on the hepatocyte
surface. This, however, contrasts with previous
reports which indicate that membrane integrity
may be better preserved on enzymatically than
on mechanically isolated hepatocytes.33 Such
discrepancy probably derives from differences
in the technique of mechanical disruption, as
suggested by the higher percentage of viable
mechanically isolated -hepatocytes we obtained
when compared with those of previous re￾ports.33
When staining mechanically isolated
hepatocytes in suspension with an indirect
immunofluorescence technique was used to
test
a series of histologically normal or diseased
livers, MHC class
I antigens were invariably
detected on hepatocytes from both normal and
diseased livers, which indicates that these
glycoproteins are constitutively expressed on
the liver cells. The absence of class
I antigens
on normal hepatocytes reported by other auth￾ors5 ' "' is likely to reflect the low sensitivity of
the techniques used rather than representing
a
genuine biological phenomenon, although an
important difference exists between the present
study and those reported-that is, our patients
are children. We have also shown that unlike
class I, class II antigens are not detected on
normal hepatocytes, which indicates that they
are either absent or expressed at
a very low
density by liver cells. This agrees with the
findings of previous reports.7

Hepatocytes, however, have the potential to
express class II antigens, as they do in immune
mediated disorders such as autoimmune
chronic active hepatitis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis.
