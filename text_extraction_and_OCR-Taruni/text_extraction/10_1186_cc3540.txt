Abstract
Introduction To assess changes in renal blood flow (RBF) in
human and experimental sepsis, and to identify determinants of
RBF.
Method Using specific search terms we systematically
interrogated two electronic reference libraries to identify
experimental and human studies of sepsis and septic acute
renal failure in which RBF was measured. In the retrieved
studies, we assessed the influence of various factors on RBF
during sepsis using statistical methods.
Results We found no human studies in which RBF was
measured with suitably accurate direct methods. Where it was
measured in humans with sepsis, however, RBF was increased
compared with normal. Of the 159 animal studies identified, 99
reported decreased RBF and 60 reported unchanged or
increased RBF. The size of animal, technique of measurement,
duration of measurement, method of induction of sepsis, and
fluid administration had no effect on RBF. In contrast, on
univariate analysis, state of consciousness of animals (P =
0.005), recovery after surgery (P < 0.001), haemodynamic
pattern (hypodynamic or hyperdynamic state; P < 0.001) and
cardiac output (P < 0.001) influenced RBF. However,
multivariate analysis showed that only cardiac output remained
an independent determinant of RBF (P < 0.001).
Conclusion The impact of sepsis on RBF in humans is
unknown. In experimental sepsis, RBF was reported to be
decreased in two-thirds of studies (62 %) and unchanged or
increased in one-third (38%). On univariate analysis, several
factors not directly related to sepsis appear to influence RBF.
However, multivariate analysis suggests that cardiac output has
a dominant effect on RBF during sepsis, such that, in the
presence of a decreased cardiac output, RBF is typically
decreased, whereas in the presence of a preserved or increased
cardiac output RBF is typically maintained or increased.
Introduction
Acute renal failure (ARF) affects 5–7% of all hospitalized
patients [1-3]. Sepsis and, in particular, septic shock are
important risk factors for ARF in wards and remain the most
important triggers for ARF in the intensive care unit (ICU) [4-
8]. Among septic patients, the incidence of ARF is up to 51%
[9] and that of severe ARF (i.e. ARF leading to the application
of acute renal replacement therapy) is 5% [7,10]. The mortality
rate associated with severe ARF in the ICU setting remains
high [2-5,11].
A possible explanation for the high incidence and poor out￾come of septic ARF relates to the lack of specific therapies.
This, in turn, relates to our poor understanding of its pathogen￾esis. Nonetheless, a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF), caus￾ing renal ischaemia, has been proposed as central to the
pathogenesis of septic ARF [12-14]. However, the bulk of
knowledge about RBF in sepsis is derived from animal studies
ARF = acute renal failure; CO = cardiac output; ICU = intensive care unit; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MVLRA = multivariate logistic regression anal￾ysis; PAH = para-aminohippurate; PVR = peripheral vascular resistance; RBF = renal blood flow; RPF = renal plasma flow.

using a variety of different models and techniques. This cre￾ates uncertainty regarding the applicability of these studies to
humans. Furthermore, the findings of studies in which experi￾mental sepsis was induced and RBF measured have not been
systematically assessed. Accordingly, we obtained all elec￾tronically identifiable publications reporting RBF in sepsis and
analyzed the data according to changes in RBF. We also stud￾ied the possible influences of several technical and model￾related variables on RBF.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic interrogation of the literature
using a standardized approach as described by Doig and
Simpson [15] and Piper and coworkers [16]. We used two
electronic reference libraries (Medline and PubMed), and
searched for relevant articles using the following search terms:
'renal blood flow', 'kidney blood flow', 'renal blood supply', 'kid￾ney blood supply', 'organ blood flow', 'organ blood supply',
'sepsis', 'septic shock', 'septicemia', 'caecal puncture ligation',
'cecum puncture ligation', 'lipopolysaccharide' and 'endotoxin'.
We selected all animal studies published in the English lan￾guage literature. Using the reference lists from each article, we
identified and obtained other possible studies that might have
reported information on RBF in septic ARF and that had not
been identified by our electronic search strategy.
We assessed all human articles in detail. Because of the het￾erogeneity animal studies and the methods they employed, we
also assessed all animal articles systematically for information
on variables that might have influenced RBF in sepsis. The var￾iables of interest were as follows: size of animal; technique of
measurement for RBF (direct measurement via flow probe or
microsphere technique or other technique); consciousness of
animals during the study; recovery period between prepara￾tion surgery and the experiment; timing of RBF measurement
in relation to septic insult; method used to induce sepsis
(lipopolysaccharide [LPS], live bacteria, or caecal ligation–
perforation technique); fluid administration during the experi￾ment; cardiac output (CO); and haemodynamic patterns
(hypodynamic and hyperdynamic sepsis).
Information obtained on RBF from these groups was com￾pared. Comparisons were performed using the ?2 test or
Fisher exact test where appropriate. Variables were also
entered into a multivariate logistic regression analysis
(MVLRA) model with RBF as the dependent variable. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Human studies
We found only three studies conducted in septic ICU patients
in which RBF was measured [17-19]. The findings of these
studies suggest an increase in RBF during sepsis (Table 1). In
only one patient was renal plasma flow (RPF) determined in
the setting of oliguric ARF [19]. Such RPF was markedly
increased at 2000 ml/min (normal 650 ml/min).
Animal models
We found 159 [20-178] animal studies that measured RBF in
sepsis. Of these, 99 (62%) reported a decrease, whereas the
remaining 60 (38%) studies reported no change or an
increase in RBF (Table 2, Fig. 1).
Animal size
Experimental studies were conducted in a large variety of ani￾mals. We divided experimental animals into small (rats, mice,
rabbits and piglets) and large (dogs, pigs and sheep). We
identified 65 (41%) studies that were conducted in small ani￾mals and 94 (59%) that were conducted in large animals
(Table 2). Of studies conducted in small animals, 46 found
decreased and 19 (29%) unchanged or increased RBF. In
large animals, 53 (56%) studies reported a decreased and 41
(44%) an unchanged or increased RBF (P = 0.066; Fig. 2).
Technique for measuring renal blood flow
The techniques used for the measurement of RBF varied
widely. Therefore, we compared studies using direct measure￾ment of RBF via ultrasonic or electromagnetic flow probes
('direct' techniques) with measurement by microsphere tech￾nique or para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance or other tech￾niques such as measurement of blood velocity via video
microscopy ('indirect' techniques). Of 80 studies using flow
probes, 49 (61%) showed a decreased and 31 (39%) an
unchanged or increased RBF (Table 2). Of 79 studies using
other methods, 50 (63%) reported a decreased and 29 (37%)
reported an unchanged or increased RBF (P = 0.791; Table
2, Fig. 2).

Consciousness of animals
The use of awake or unconscious animals might also have
influenced RBF. For this reason, we compared studies using
conscious with those using unconscious animals. Of 127
experiments conducted in unconscious animals (Table 2), 86
(68%) reported a decreased and 41 (32%) an unchanged or
increased RBF. Of 32 studies conducted in conscious ani￾mals (Table 2), 13 (41 %) reported a decreased and 19 (59%)
reported no change or an increase in RBF (P = 0.005; Fig. 1).
Recovery period between surgical preparation and actual 
experiment
Before conducting the experiments, a surgical procedure is
typically needed to prepare the animals. We compared studies
starting the experiment immediately after surgery with studies
with a recovery period after anaesthesia. Of 33 studies with a
recovery period (Table 2), 11 (33%) showed a decreased and
22 (67%) showed an unchanged or increased RBF. Of 126
studies without a recovery period (Table 2), 88 (70%)
reported a decreased and 38 (30%) reported no change or an
increase in RBF (P < 0.001; Fig. 1).
Time from septic insult
The duration of RBF observation after the septic insult varied
widely. We divided the studies into those with a 'short' (<2
hours; early period after induction of sepsis) or 'long' (>2
hours; late period after the induction of sepsis) observation
time. Among 47 experiments with short periods of observation
after the induction of sepsis (Table 2), 32 (68%) showed a
decreased and 15 (32%) showed an unchanged or increased
RBF. Among the 112 experiments with long periods of obser￾vation after the induction of sepsis (Table 2), 67 (60%)
showed a decreased and 45 (40%) showed an unchanged or
increased RBF (P = 0.327; Fig. 2).
Methods of inducing sepsis
Many different methods of induction of sepsis were used. We
compared LPS-induced sepsis with sepsis induced by injec￾tion of live bacteria or caecal ligation–perforation. Of 100 arti￾cles that used LPS (Table 2), 67 (67%) showed a decreased
and 33 (33%) showed an unchanged or increased RBF.
Among the other 59 studies (Table 2), 32 (54%) reported a
reduced and 27 (46%) reported an unchanged or increased
RBF (P = 0.109; Fig. 2).
Fluid administration
We compared studies according to whether there was fluid
administration during the experiments. Thirty-four articles did
not mention fluid administration. Among the 20 studies with no
fluid administration (Table 2), 16 (80%) reported a decreased
and 4 (20%) reported an unchanged or increased RBF. Of the
106 studies in which fluid was given (Table 2), 63 (59%)
showed a decrease and 43 (41%) showed no change or an
increase in RBF (P = 0.081; Fig. 2).
Haemodynamic patterns
Most septic patients exhibit a hyperdynamic state with ele￾vated CO and decreased blood pressure, when CO is meas￾ured. Therefore, we compared studies in which animals had a
hyperdynamic state (low peripheral vascular resistance [PVR])
of sepsis with studies in which this state was not present (nor￾mal or high PVR). There were 84 studies in which the hypody￾namic versus hyperdynamic pattern could be assessed. Of 42
studies that fulfilled criteria for hypodynamic sepsis (Table 2),
38 (90%) showed a reduced and 4 (10%) showed no change
or an increase in RBF. Of the 42 studies conducted in hyper￾dynamic sepsis (Table 2), 14 (33%) reported a decreased and
28 (67%) reported an unchanged or increased RBF (P <
0.001; Fig. 1).
Cardiac output
We compared those studies with increased or unchanged CO
with studies with decreased CO. Some studies gave no indi￾cation of CO. Of the 51 studies with decreased CO (Table 2),
46 (90%) reported a decreased and 5 (10%) reported an
unchanged or increased RBF. Among the 67 studies with an
unchanged or increased CO (Table 2), 27 (40%) showed a
reduced and 45 (60%) showed an unchanged or increased
RBF (P < 0.001; Fig. 1).

Using MVLRA, we created a model to test for independent
determinants of a RBF and found that only CO remained in the
model (P < 0.001) as a significant predictor for RBF (Table 3).

We interrogated two electronic databases to assess the
changes that occur in RBF during human and experimental
sepsis in order to examine what might be the determinants of
sepsis-associated changes in RBF. Variables that might influ￾ence RBF were used to categorize the heterogeneous data
we found.
We found only a few human studies reporting RBF in a septic
setting and found that the techniques used to measure RBF
had poor accuracy and reproducibility. Only in a single patient
with septic oliguric ARF was RBF measured. Nonetheless,
within these serious limitations, we found that an increase in
RBF was typically seen during sepsis.
We found that most animal studies reported a decrease in
RBF in sepsis. However, we found that, in one-third of studies,
RBF was either maintained or increased. We also found con￾tradictory and inconsistent experimental findings with regard
to RBF, which appeared to be affected by factors other than
the induction of sepsis itself, including the consciousness of
the animal, the recovery time after surgery and the haemody￾namic pattern (hypodynamic or hyperdynamic state). More
importantly, using MVLRA, we found that all of the above fac￾tors could be reduced to the dominant effect of CO on RBF.
Thus, a low CO predicted a decreased RBF and a preserved
or high CO predicted an unchanged or increased RBF. These
findings are complex and require detailed discussion.
Human studies
Currently, only invasive techniques for measuring RBF have a
high degree of accuracy. They require renal vein sampling.
Because of the risks associated with such invasive measure￾ment of RBF, only a few such studies have been conducted in
humans with sepsis. Noninvasive methods of measurement
such as the PAH clearance method are also possible but they
assume a constant PAH extraction ratio of 0.91, such that RPF
can be calculated with measurement of PAH concentrations in
blood and urine. Unfortunately, the 'constant' PAH extraction
ratio is not at all constant, is markedly unstable and is influ￾enced by many factors, all of which apply in sepsis and ARF
[18,19]. Therefore, in order to achieve improved accuracy, this
method must be made invasive by inserting a renal vein cathe￾ter in order to calculate the true PAH extraction ratio. The RPF
measured by this method is called the true RPF. Finally, a third
method uses a thermodilution renal vein catheter. RPF and
RBF determined by the thermodilution method were reported
to correlate with corrected PAH clearances (r = 0.79) [17].
However, a recently reported study [179] demonstrated that
both methods have a low reproducibility and a within group
error of up to 40%. Therefore, these methods are not suffi￾ciently accurate to detect potentially important changes in
RBF. Nonetheless, within the boundaries of the technology,
true RPF measurements from human studies (Table 1) consist￾ently suggest that renal blood flow is increased during human
sepsis. In only one study [19] was RBF estimated in a septic
patient with ARF. The RPF was found to be 2000 ml/min in this
patient, which contrasts with the normal RPF in humans of
600–700 ml/min [180].
Animal models
Animal size
In small animals, RBFs values are very small (7.39 ml/min
[40]). The changes estimated in different settings are even
smaller (1.4 ml/min [40]). On the other hand, absolute blood
flows in large animals are up to 250 times greater (330 ml/min
[55]). We hypothesized that measurement accuracy might
therefore change with animal size and lead to different obser￾Table 3

vations. We found a strong trend in this direction, which just
failed to achieve statistical significance.
Technique of measurement if renal blood flow
Using the flow probe technique, it is possible to measure the
RBF continuously. Microsphere techniques are also accurate
and can distinguish between cortical and medullar RBF, but
using the latter technique it is only possible to take several
'snapshot views' of blood flow during the experiment. We
hypothesized that the technique of measurement might have
influenced findings. However, there was no significant differ￾ence between techniques.
Consciousness of animals
Most studies were conducted in unconscious animals. Within
this group, RBF was significantly more likely to be decreased
than in conscious animals. This effect might partly be
explained by anaesthesia rather than sepsis itself. Our
observations highlight this as an important area of concern in
drawing conclusions about the effect of sepsis per se on RBF.
Time from septic insult
A recently published animal study [55] described the time￾dependent development of hyperdynamic sepsis after live
Escherichia coli injection. In that study the CO decreased
immediately after injection, recovered and then increased by 2
hours until a hyperdynamic state was reached. Therefore, we
divided the studies in experiments with less or greater than 2
hours of observation time after the septic insult in order to
determine whether there were differences between early and
late septic states. We hypothesized that studies with longer
periods of observation after the insult (late sepsis) might show
a different RBF. However, there was no difference between
the two groups.
Recovery period
Surgical preparation was performed in many of the reviewed
studies just before the experiments were started. The negative
effect on RBF of immediately beginning the experiments after
surgery might be explained by the prolonged anaesthesia time
and the negative effect of anaesthesia. We found that lack of
an adequate recovery period after surgical preparation
increased the likelihood of RBF being decreased.
Method of inducing sepsis
Many different techniques are used to induce sepsis such as
LPS injection, live bacteria injection and caecal ligation–perfo￾ration. Previous reports [181,182] described a strong hypody￾namic effect of injecting a bolus of LPS. Therefore, we
hypothesized that studies using LPS might show decreased
RBF. We found a trend in this direction that approached sta￾tistical significance.
Fluid administration
Most of the studies administered fluid during the experiments
to counteract the hypotensive of effect of sepsis [14]. These
fluids might maintain CO, central venous pressure and blood
pressure, and thus affect RBF. As might be expected, we
found a strong trend toward a higher RBF when fluid resusci￾tation was given, but this failed to achieve statistical
significance.
Haemodynamic patterns
In septic patients, CO, blood pressure and PVR can be
assessed. Most of these patients have an increased CO, a low
blood pressure and a decreased PVR [14,183-189]. To
assess what might happen to RBF in a haemodynamic situa￾tion simulating human sepsis, we compared studies with ani￾mals that had developed hyperdynamic sepsis (increased CO
and decreased blood pressure) with those studies with hypo￾dynamic sepsis (normal or increased PVR). Animals with
hyperdynamic sepsis were more likely to exhibit preserved or
increased RBF.
Cardiac output
In a recently published article [190] using a crossover animal
model, CO was found to be the most important variable influ￾encing organ blood flows. Thus, we compared studies show￾ing an unchanged or increased CO with studies showing a
decreased CO. We found a clear association between
decreased CO and decreased RBF and between a preserved
or increased CO and a preserved or increased RBF. Multivar￾iate logistic analysis confirmed the role of CO as the most
powerful independent predictor of RBF in sepsis (Table 2).
Limitations
We only interrogated two English language electronic refer￾ence libraries and might have missed original contributions
reported in other languages. However, we believe that it is
unlikely that enough such studies would exist to change our
conclusions materially.
In order to make comparisons, we categorized experiments
according to pre-set criteria (small versus large animals, meth￾ods of induction of sepsis, high versus low CO, etc.) that we
hypothesized, on grounds of biological plausibility, were likely
to affect experimental findings. We acknowledge that such cri￾teria are by definition arbitrary and the subject of individual
judgement. Furthermore, other criteria that we did not con￾sider could be tested. Nonetheless, we found that many of
these criteria appeared to have some effect in reality. We also
found that such effects appeared to be mostly related to their
association with the CO state, which overwhelmingly was the
only independent predictor in MVLRA for the outcome of RBF.
We consider it unlikely that the choice of other criteria for com￾parison would materially affect our conclusions.

R369
The observation time in the reviewed articles varied widely as
well. We compared articles with a shorter period after the
insult (2 hours) versus studies with a longer period of observa￾tion. We acknowledge that this division is artificial and might
not truly reflect what happened, because some groups waited
until the animal reached defined criteria before starting their
observation time and others begun the observation immedi￾ately after the septic insult, making this variable extremely het￾erogeneous. Nonetheless, once again, given the
overwhelming effect of CO on RBF, we consider that refine￾ments to this criterion are unlikely to influence our conclusions.
Our observations suggest that the widely held paradigm that
RBF decreases in sepsis [12-14] and that such a decrease is
responsible for the development of ARF is indeed sustained by
the majority of studies. However, the reality beyond such a
simplistic observation is much more complex. The animal stud￾ies are extraordinarily heterogeneous in their design and mon￾itoring of RBF. Furthermore, the support that the bulk of the
data offer to the concept of decreased RBF in sepsis is con￾ditional upon a particular model of sepsis being present (hypo￾dynamic sepsis without an increase in CO). If the CO is
increased and PVR is decreased, then the most common find￾ing is actually one of increased or preserved RBF. In the light
of this review, we suggest that measurement of CO is a vital
component of all future experimental studies measuring RBF
in sepsis.
We note that, in human sepsis, systemic vasodilatation with a
high CO is the dominant clinical finding. Such vasodilatation
might also affect the afferent and efferent arterioles of the kid￾ney. If the efferent arteriole dilated proportionately more than
the afferent arteriole, then there would be a decrease in
glomerular filtration pressure. This change in filtration pressure
would decrease glomerular filtration rate and lead to oliguria
and loss of small solute clearance. Accordingly, loss of
glomerular filtration rate can occur with either vasoconstriction
or vasodilatation.
Our findings have important implications for clinicians and for
future strategies directed at preserving renal function in sep￾sis. They highlight the absence of human data. They show the
heterogeneity and model dependence of the animal data. They
also emphasize the limitations of the indirect data upon which
clinical strategies are based. Much research remains to be
done if we are to establish what happens to renal blood flow
in human sepsis, and techniques are needed that permit such
measurements to be taken noninvasively.
Conclusion
We interrogated the two major English language electronic
reference libraries to examine changes in RBF in sepsis and
septic ARF. We found that inadequate data exist to allow any
conclusions to be drawn on the typical RBF or changes in RBF
in humans. We also found that experimental data are extraor￾dinarily heterogeneous in nature but show the dominant effect
of CO on RBF, such that a low CO predicts a decreased RBF
and an increased or preserved CO predicts an increased or
preserved RBF. Given that CO is typically increased when
measured in human sepsis in the ICU, the widely held para￾digm that decreased RBF is pivotal to the pathogenesis of
septic ARF might require reassessment.

Key messages
• It is unknown whether RBF is increased, decreased, or 
unchanged in human sepsis.
• Techniques to measure RBF in humans are invasive and 
of limited accuracy.
• Data on RBF from animals are heterogenous and do not 
allow firm conclusions to be drawn.
• RBF findings in experimental sepsis depend on the 
model used.
• CO is the most important independent predictor of RBF 
in sepsis: if CO is increased, then RBF is typically 
increased; and if CO is decreased, the RBF is typically 
decreased.
