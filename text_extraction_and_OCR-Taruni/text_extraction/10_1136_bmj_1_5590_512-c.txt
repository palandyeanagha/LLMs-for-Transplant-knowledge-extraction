common in the enterobacteria of the infant
population of Dublin.
Dr. Anderson suggests that the R factors
in the Tees-side strains had probably been
transferred from non-pathogenic Re+ B. coli.
Our findings support his view. One possible
method of preventing the spread of R factors
within a hospital is to isolate all infants
ecreting R+ enterobacteria on admission. As
it is a routine practice in most children's
hospitals to culture the faeces of infants on
admission for pathogenic enterobacteria, I
suggest that a direct sensitivity test should
also be done on the faeces. All infants
carrying R* strains should be isolated within
the hospital. It would not be possible or
necessary to screen for R factors, because it is
most probable that if the organism is multi￾resistant it is R+.--I am, etc.,

Misuse of Antibiotics
Sn,--In the last paragraph of your lead￾ing article on " Transferable Antibiotic Resis￾tance" (3 February, p. 263) you raise the
question of whether or not antibiotics should
be prescribed for mild respiratory infection
in view of their possible effect on intestinal
flora. The same question may be asked with
regard to mild sporadic gastrointestinal upsets
in children.
Fcr a period of about a year between
1965 and 1966 1 was in charge of a military
families' clinic in Malaya. Diarrhoea was a
common cause of attndance and stool
specimens were obtained from all but a small
minority of patients. In one child a patho￾genic E. coli was isolated, and in one woman
a clinical diagnosis of dysentery was con￾firmed. In all the other cases recovery
followed dietary restriction with the prescrip￾tion of kaolin or codeine phosphate, and no
bacterial pathogens were isolated.
One wonders how often antibiotics are
prescribed " for safety." It has certainly
been my impression that the admission of a
child to hospital sometimes appears to be
precipitated by vomiting following the admin￾istration of (usually) sulphonamides. These
same children get well as a rule without
further antibiotics, and bacterial pathogens
are not isolated.
It would be of interest and value to know
how frequently antibiotics are prescribed for
diarrhoea and vomiting in England, and
whether recovery is in fact speeded by their
use. Perhaps this would be a suitable sub￾ject for the Royal College of General Prac￾dtioners to investigate.-I am, etc.,

Fatal Embolus During "Pill"
Administration
SIR,-I wish to record a case of sudden
death in a young woman of 23 who had been
taking an oral contraceptive containing
mestranol and ethynodiol diacetate for three
months. I might add that this was not pre￾scribed by me.
Post-mortem examination revealed a large
pulmonary embolus, and loosely adherent
antemortem thrombus was found in both iliac
veins and their tributaries. There was no
other lesion present which might have pre￾disposed to thrombosis.

Dunlop Committee.-I am, etc.,

Degoss Syndrome
Snt,-Mr. R. E. May's well-documented
medical memorandum (20 January, p. 161)
describes a case under the title "Degos's
Syndrome" (malignant atrophic papulosis).
The photographs illustrating the case, and the
description of the skin lesions, do not sub￾stantate a diagnosis of this rare syndrome.
Degos,l in a private communication, main￾tains that the cutaneous lesions are so
characteristic that the diagnosis is easily made
from a photograph. Case reports such as
those of Nomland and Layton,' Naylor et al.'
..
and Winkelmann et al.' are illustrated -wit
photographs which show typical lesions of
malignant atrophic papulosis. These are well
shown in the accompanying photograph of
the first reported British case.'
The early lesion is a pale rose papule of 2-5
mm. diameter which soon becomes umbilicated
and porc~elain-wblte in colour, though some
lesions mayt show a yellowish scaly centre ; a
striking feature is the sharply defined and
elevated enclosing pink halo. Ulceration of the
skin is rare. The eruption occurs in crops at
intervals of days or weeks and the development
of a characteristic lesion with a porcelain-white
centre may occur over a period of 7-10 days.
The black centre and tenderness of the lesions
in the case described would make most dermato￾logists query the diagnosis ; also, in Degos's
syndrome the patient is almost invariably
asymptomaic: in the early cutaneous phase of
the disease, which may precede the onset of
abdomninal symptoms by months and sometimes
years.
A diagnosis of Degos's syndrome cannot be
upheld on Whe basis of a histopathology
which shows a non-specific vasculitis; in our
present state of knowledge probably " allergic
vasculitis " might serve as a convenient label
for this most interesting case.-I am, etc.,

Budd-Chiari Syndrome after Oral
Contraceptives
SIR,-At the time of the report by Drs.
K. Sterup and J. Mosbech (16 December,
p. 660) we were treating a very similar
patient who had been taking the same oral
contraceptive, lynoestrenol 5 mg. and mestra￾nol 0.15 mg. (Lyndiol) for six months, and
for the previous six months another oral
contraceptive, Gynovlar 21 (norethisterone
acetate ;thinyloestradiol).
A 37-year-old housewife with two children
had been perfectly well until a few weeks before
admission on 3 December 1967, when she had
developed a slight sensation of distension in
the upper abdomen. About 24 hours before
admission she had vague epigastric pain, which
became severe within a few hours, radiating to
the left scapular region and right hypochondrium
and associated with vomiting of bile and a little
altered blood. The pain continued and was
accompanied by the passage of several greenish
loose stools.
On admission the patient was shocked and
dehydrated, with a pulse rate of 134/min. and
a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm. Hg, the
diastolic pressure being unobtainable. There
was possibly slight icterus, and the urine con￾tained a trace of bile and albumin. There was
marked tenderness in the epigastrium and right
hypochondrium, and a smooth mass could be
palpated in the epigastrium. There was on
admission no evidence of ascites, and bowel
sounds were normal. The possibilities of a
posterior perforation of peptic ulcer into the
lesser sac or acute pancreatitis were suspected.
The dehydration and shock were treated with
intravenous fluids, and repeated gastric aspira￾tion was performed. The serum amylase was
normal (160 units/1OO ml.), and the plasma
electrolytes were normal except for a raised
potassium of 5.2 mEq/L and an alkali reserve
of 12 mEq/l. The blood urea was 47 mg./100
ml., the haemoglobin 16.5 g./l00 ml., P.C.V.
57.5%, and white count 23,000/cu. mm. with
a polymorphonuclear leucocytosis. After intra￾venous fluids and ampicillin the patients general
condition improved over the next 36 hours,
though her daily output of urine was never
more than 100 ml. Two days after admission
she deteriorated again, with hypotension and
drowsiness, but no fetor hepaticus or liver
flap. The blood urea had risen to 120 mg./100
ml. By this time she had developed a large
ascites anJ was slightly icteric. The liver-function
tests were reported subsequently as bilirubin
2.5 mg./100 ml., S.G.O.T. 2,000 R.F. units/ml.,
and alkaline phosphatase 18 K.A. units/100 ml.
With the rapid development of ascites a diag￾nosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome was made, but,
as the possibility of generalized peritonitis could
not be excluded, a laparotomy was performed
which revealed a large amount of clear ascitic
fluid, a grossly enlarged, engorged purple liver,
and a moderately enlarged spleen. Mo other
organs were obviously diseased. A wedge liver
biopsy was taken, which showed necrosis of mon

of the liver cells except for those around the
portal tracts, which appeared normal. The
centrilobular zones were very haemorrhagic, the
mid-zonal sinusoids were distended with blood,
but the surviving outer zones were not congested.
Her oliguric renal failure continued and was
treated with intracaval 20% mannitol at first
and 40% dextrose. She continued to deteriorate,
however, and became comatose. Despite peri￾tzneal dialysis for her renal failure, supervised
by Dr. H. M. Leather, she did not improve
and died on 13 December 1967.
At necropsy, by Dr. M. R. Thomas, a
smooth mottled thrombus was found project￾ing from the orifice of the hepatic vein and
partially obstructing its lumen. Dissection
into the main tributaries showed dark-red
adherent thrombus occluding the veins. The
liver weighed 2,600 g., and the left lobe was
relatively enlarged compared with the right.
The outer aspect was icteric and cyanosed,
and the cut surface was similar to a " nutmeg
liver," except that the red zones were brighter,
larger, and more sharply demarcated than
those seen in cardiac failure. The liver histo￾logy confirmed the microscopic appearances
found in the biopsy specimen, and an occa￾sional cluster of hepatic cells were under￾going calcification. An antemortem thrombus
of a flat strap-like appearance was found in
the inferior vena cava and right common iliac
and femoral veins extending up to about
2 in. (5 cm.) below the thrombus in the
hepatic vein from the site of insertion of the
inferior caval catheter. There was oedema
and congestion of the lungs, with a 6-cm. red
infarct in the right lower lobe due to an
embolus. The lower oesophagus, stomach,
and upper jejunum were congested with a
few small subserosal haemorrhages. The
kidneys appeared normal, but histology
showed moderate cloudy swelling of the
tubular epithelium and some calcified con￾cretions within the tubular lumen. The
spleen was dark and firm, weighing 325 g.

Gallstone Disease
SIR,-Professor A. J. Harding Rains (3
February, p. 295) states in his interesting
article, that " Foreign bodies also act as
nuclei for stones." This brought to mind
a patient who passed through my hands about
10 years ago.
She was a white woman of 33 (parity un￾known) who was referred for an oral cholecysto￾gram by her family doctor, who suspected that
she was suffering from "gallstone disease." The
resultant radiographs were such that a confident
diagnosis of the presence of a foreign body (a
pin) surrounded by cholesterol stones in the gall
bladder could be made. The gall bladder itself
concentrated the contrast medium satisfactorily
and contracted well after the stimulus of a fatty
meal.
IF~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-
Subsequently the patient admitted that
about five years previously she had swallowed
a few pins deliberately. At operation several
cholesterol gallstones were found, one of
them encasing the pin. There were no
adhesions between the biliary and alimentary
tracts, and how the pin passed from one to
the other must be conjectural.-I am, etc.,

Volvulus of Sigmoid Colon
SIR,-As a recent colleague of Mr. J. J.
Shepherd I would congratulate him on his
report of 425 cases of sigmoid volvulus in
Africans (3 February, p. 280), but I must
question him over his advice of conservative
management by intubation for the non￾gangrenous type of volvulus seen in Uganda.
My own experience, gained over 21 months
at Mulago Hospital (and Mr. Shepherd's
paper), leads me to recommend primary
resection as the treatment of choice.
The comparison of 89 patients treated con￾scrvatively without a death with 65 patients
treated by resection with 16 deaths (25%) must
be qualified, as patients exhibiting signs of
shock and peritonitis will be preferentially sub￾jected to laparotomy in the belief that gangrene
exists, whereas those more healthy patients with￾out such ominous signs will be more veadily
chosen for intubation. The highest mortality
of all (33%) relates to three deaths in nine
patients with viable bowel who were subjected
to laparotomy after the failure of intubation.
There were eight deaths (16%) in 49 patients
subjected to laparotomy with untwisting of
viable bo)wel. These deaths should not be due to
untwisting, as death does not follow intubation
alone. In Uganda cardiopulmonary disease is
very rare in surgical patients ; hence the pre￾sumptive cause of death must be inappropriate
surgery and anaesthesia in the face of dehydra￾tion and electrolyte imbalance resulting from the
intestinal obstruction and any hookworm anaemia
(which is common).
Primary resection in 35 patients with viable
bowel had a lower mortality (14%) than mere
untwisting. i The known recurrence rate of 18 out of 43
patients who failed to have further treatment
following immediate intubation was 42%. If
a similar overall mortality of 50: 425 appertains
to this group then four deaths could be expected.
To these may be added the two deaths following
anaesthesia for elective resection in 74 patients,
to give a mortality of six (5%) out of 117
patients treated by immediate intubation alone
in their first attack. My memory of discussions
with Mr. Shepherd reminds me that the mortality
in the second or subsequent attack of volvulus
is higher than that of the first attack. Further￾more, the true recurrence rate must be higher
than 42 %.
The choice offered lies between immediate
intubation followed by elective resection (with
its inevitable opportunity for the patient to
refuse operation or default from readmission
for resection, and with a minimum mortality
rate of 5 % plus the dire consequences of
laparotomy when intubation fails) and prim￾ary resection of patients with viable bowel,
which carries a 14% mortality ; in neither
instance is the mortality due to the sigmoid
resection. Mr. Shepherd states that the
pelvic colon is thick-walled and vascular, and
it is of interest that this holds good for the
bowel distal to the twist. From my own
experience I can add that the distension is
almost totally gaseous ; in fact, a more per￾fectly prepared bowel would be difficult to
find. It therefore seems that primary resec￾tion is both theoretically and practically
acceptable ; the error rests in the selection
and preparation of patients for resection.
Surely the advice needed is to improve the
surgery of primary resection and not to
retreat to a policy of dubious value for the
wrong reasons.-I am, etc.,

SIR,-Mr. J. J. Shepherd's paper (3 Febru￾ary, p. 280) provides important confirmation
of the value of conservative treatment of sig￾moid volvulus by Bruusgaard's technique of
sigmoidoscopy and intubation. It seems
possible that an important factor in the
success of this technique is the fact that the
patient is usually placed in the knee-elbow
position for sigmoidoscopy. Indeed, two of
Mr. Shepherd's patients spontaneously passed
gas when placed in this position prior to
sigmoidoscopy.
Consideration of the anatomical and
physical factors involved will indicate why
this should be so (see Figure). In a colonic
vosvulus gas accumulates in the convexity of
the distended loop, which rises upwards. The
site of the torsion is fixed by the mesenteric
attachment to the posterior abdominal wall.
If the patient is supine, or even upright, the
site of the torsion will usually be the lowest
point. Any fluid in the loop will therefore
collect at this site and form a seal which willProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.
