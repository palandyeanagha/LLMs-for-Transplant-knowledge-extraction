Introduction
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening 
complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplanta￾tion (allo-HCT). About 50% of patients with severe acute GVHD 
fail to respond to corticosteroids, and steroid-refractory severe 
GVHD has a dismal prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of less 
than 20% (1). GVHD was classically considered to involve only 
the skin, the intestinal tract, and the liver, which was defined as 
the “tissue tropism of acute GVHD.” However, there is increas￾ing evidence that the effects of acute GVHD are not limited to 
the 3 classical target organs, but can also occur in the central ner￾vous system (CNS). Animal studies showed that the transfer of 
allogeneic T cells caused CNS infiltration by effector memory T 
cells during GVHD and apoptosis in neurons, as well as reduced 
exploratory activity, spatial learning, and memory, in the recipi￾ent mice (2). Evidence for CNS-GVHD was not restricted solely 
to the murine model, as other investigators reported that CNS 
infiltration by CD8+ T cells was a key feature of GVHD in non￾human primates (3). Conversely, treatment of primates with 
immunoprophylaxis after allo-HCT reduced the abundance of 
T cell infiltration into the brain (3). Consistent with findings in 
preclinical models, human brain analysis of female sex-mis￾matched bone marrow transplant recipients has identified cell 
infiltrates derived from Y chromosome+ donors (4). In agree￾ment with the occurrence of CNS-GVHD in patients, neurolog￾ical deficits and MRI findings have been reported in patients 
developing GVHD (5).
The role of microglia for CNS inflammation during GVHD 
has remained unclear. Here we show, for the first time to 
our knowledge, that GVHD caused activation of microglia 
cells. Based on selective genetic ablation of TGF-β–activated 
kinase-1 (TAK1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in microglia, 
we identify the TAK1/TNF/MHC-II axis as a central mediator 
of CNS inflammation. In a translational approach, we show that 
TAK1 inhibition reduces GVHD-induced neurotoxicity in mice, 
which provides a scientific rationale for testing this approach in 
a phase I trial in humans.
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can affect the central nervous system (CNS). The role of microglia in CNS-GVHD 
remains undefined. In agreement with microglia activation, we found that profound morphological changes and MHC-II and 
CD80 upregulation occurred upon GVHD induction. RNA sequencing–based analysis of purified microglia obtained from mice 
with CNS-GVHD revealed TNF upregulation. Selective TNF gene deletion in microglia of Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/– mice reduced MHC-II 
expression and decreased CNS T cell infiltrates and VCAM-1+
 endothelial cells. GVHD increased microglia TGF-β–activated 
kinase-1 (TAK1) activation and NF-κB/p38 MAPK signaling. Selective Tak1 deletion in microglia using Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl
mice resulted in reduced TNF production and microglial MHC-II and improved neurocognitive activity. Pharmacological 
TAK1 inhibition reduced TNF production and MHC-II expression by microglia, Th1 and Th17 T cell infiltrates, and VCAM-1+
endothelial cells and improved neurocognitive activity, without blocking graft-versus-leukemia effects. Consistent with these 
findings in mice, we observed increased activation and TNF production of microglia in the CNS of GVHD patients. In summary, 
we prove a role for microglia in CNS-GVHD, identify the TAK1/TNF/MHC-II axis as a mediator of CNS-GVHD, and provide a 
TAK1 inhibitor–based approach against GVHD-induced neurotoxicity.

total-body irradiation (Supplemental Figure 1D). To characterize 
the transcriptional profile of microglia under GVHD conditions, 
we next isolated microglia based on CD11b and CD45lo expres￾sion from mice undergoing allo-HCT versus syn-HCT. RNA-Seq 
analysis showed close clustering of individual samples belonging 
to 1 group (Figure 2C). Microglia isolated from mice developing 
GVHD displayed a strong upregulation of genes involved in anti￾gen presentation, in comparison with untreated mice or mice that 
had undergone syn-HCT (Figure 2D). In line with the RNA-Seq 
results, the microglia cells (CD11b+
CD45lo) expressed higher pro￾tein levels of MHC-II and CD80 on their surface, which have both 
been shown to be activation and maturation markers of myeloid 
cells (Figure 2, E–H). We also observed reduced expression of 
CX3CR1 on microglia upon GVHD induction (Figure 2, I and J) 
which is consistent with reports showing that this chemokine 
receptor declines on microglia upon activation (7).
Microglia cells exhibit increased TNF production upon CNS￾GVHD, and genetic deletion of TNF in microglia reduces disease 
activity. To further characterize the transcriptome of the activated 
microglia cells under GVHD conditions, we next analyzed their 
cytokine expression in mice undergoing allo-HCT versus syn￾HCT. RNA-Seq analysis showed that multiple proinflammatory 
cytokines increased in microglia cells from the allo-HCT group 
(Figure 3A). A major GVHD-related cytokine that can mediate 
local cytotoxic effects is TNF. We hypothesized that TNF could 
be responsible for local tissue damage in the CNS because of its 
cytotoxic activity. To validate the findings on the protein levels, we 
next analyzed microglia by flow cytometry and found increased 
TNF production in mice that underwent allo-HCT compared with 
the syn-HCT group (Figure 3, B and C).
To probe whether microglial TNF plays a functional role in 
CNS-GVHD, we next induced GVHD in Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/– mice, 
which lack TNF in microglia. The Cx3cr1creER model was chosen 
because, following tamoxifen-induced gene deletion, short-living 
peripheral CX3CR1+
 monocytes and DCs are rapidly replenished 
within 4 weeks of tamoxifen induction and hence re-express the 
target gene, while in contrast the long-living microglia cells main￾tain the gene deletion (6). We found that Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/– mice 
exhibited lower frequencies of CD3+
 cells in the cortex and menin￾ges compared with littermate controls (Figure 3, D–F). RNA-Seq 
of microglia showed a reduction of Tnf, confirming the gene abla￾tion, as well as of Cd74 and MHC-II (H2-Eb1) in Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/–
mice compared with littermate controls (Figure 3G).
These studies identify TNF as a major pathogenic cytokine in 
CNS-GVHD based on unbiased RNA-Seq of microglia and func￾tional gene deletion using the Cre-lox system.
GVHD enhances proinflammatory MAPK/NF-κB/TAK1 signaling 
in microglia cells. Since TNF, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-1β, which we 
had found in the RNA-Seq analysis of the microglia, activate vari￾ous signaling cascades in immune cells, we next aimed at under￾standing which signaling events were responsible for the observed 
microglia activation. Transcriptome analysis of microglia showed 
upregulation of multiple signaling molecules, including Map3k7, 
encoding TGF-β–activated kinase-1 (TAK1) (Figure 4A). In agree￾ment with this upregulation, we found increased phosphorylation 
of p38 MAPK, indicating the activation of the MAPK/NF-κB signa￾ling pathway, in mice developing CNS-GVHD (Figure 4, B and C). 
Results
Microglia activation and expansion are features of CNS-GVHD. To 
determine whether GVHD induction in our models caused T cell 
infiltration into the CNS as a characteristic feature of CNS-GVHD 
(2), we analyzed the brains of mice that underwent syngeneic 
HCT (syn-HCT) or allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT). The abundance 
of CD3+
 T cells increased in the cortex and the meninges of mice 
that underwent allo-HCT, but not syn-HCT (Figure 1, A–D). Allo￾HCT also led to an increased frequency of CD11b+
CD45hi cells 
(Figure 1, E and F). The CD11b+
CD45hi cells in the CNS of mice 
undergoing allo-HCT included dendritic cells, macrophages, 
and monocytes (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental mate￾rial available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/
JCI130272DS1). Of these myeloid cells, monocytes were most 
abundant with a median of 23% (range 3%–35%) of the CD11b+
CD45hi cells. To quantify the contribution of donor-derived mono￾cytes to the increased TNF production and MHC-II expression, we 
used donor mice lacking CCR2, which exhibit reduced monocyte 
migration. We observed no reduction of TNF production or MHC￾II expression in the group that had received the bone marrow graft 
from CCR2–/– donors (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C).
Hence we next analyzed the morphology of microglia cells. 
We observed that the filament dendrite length and the numbers 
of dendrite segments, branching points, and dendrite terminal 
points declined in mice that developed GVHD compared with 
mice that underwent syn-HCT or untreated mice (Figure 1, G–K). 
Comparable morphological changes have been previously report￾ed as features of microglia activation in autoimmune disease of 
the CNS (6). In aggregate these findings show that profound mor￾phological changes indicative of microglia activation occur upon 
CNS-GVHD induction.
MHC class II and CD80 expression is increased on microglia cells 
of mice developing GVHD. The CNS of mice undergoing allo-HCT 
harbored increased numbers of Iba-1+
 microglia cells on day 14 
after allo-HCT compared with syn-HCT (Figure 2, A and B). Con￾versely, the microglia decreased on day 7 in both groups receiving

cells to increasing TNF concentrations. We observed that TNF 
caused activation of TAK1, JNK, and p65 (Figure 4, D–I). In agree￾ment with this result, IκB was increasingly degraded, a sign of 
higher NF-κB activity (Figure 4J). These findings show that the 
TAK1/NF-κB signaling cascade is active in microglia and can be 
induced in vitro by TNF exposure.
This finding is consistent with our observation that TNF expres￾sion is increased in microglia and with published data showing that 
TAK1/NF-κB signaling triggers TNF production (8).
TNF can be induced by NF-κB signaling but can also by itself 
amplify NF-κB pathway activity. Therefore, we studied the effect 
of TNF on NF-κB signaling in microglia in vitro by exposing the

Deletion of TAK1 in microglia reduces CNS-GVHD. It was 
previously shown that upon stimulation TAK1 and its adaptors 
— TAB2, TAB3, and NEMO — are recruited to the polyubiquiti￾nated receptor–interacting (TNFSF-interacting) serine-thre￾onine kinase 1 (RIPK1), in turn allowing TAK1 to phosphorylate 
and activate the catalytic inhibitor of IκB kinase (IKK) subunits 
(9). The resulting IKK activation induces expression of multiple 
cytokines and chemokines. In this context, TAK1 was shown to 
be a central mediator in proinflammatory cytokine signaling, 
including TRAF6/TNF (10). Induction of GVHD in Cx3cr1creER
Tak1fl/fl mice that lack TAK1 in microglia but not peripheral mac￾rophages (Supplemental Figure 1, E–H) caused reduced CD3+
 T 
cell frequencies in the meninges and cortex in comparison with 
littermate controls (Figure 5, A–D).
In line with reduced CNS inflammation, Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl
mice exhibited lower numbers of Iba-1+ cells in the menin￾ges and cortex compared with littermate controls (Figure 5, E 
and F). Also lower MHC-II levels were found on microglia of 
Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice compared with littermate controls (Fig￾ure 5, G and H). Consistent with a concept that TAK1 promotes

TNF production, we observed lower TNF expression in micro￾glia of Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice compared with littermate con￾trols (Figure 5, I and J).
To analyze whether the CX3CR1-Cre system was specifically 
active after tamoxifen treatment, we used Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice 
without tamoxifen treatment. There was no evidence for TAK1 
deletion in Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice without tamoxifen treatment 
(Supplemental Figure 1, I and J). Also, there was no evidence for 
Cre expression in neurons of Cx3cr1creER R26-Tomato reporter 
mice (Supplemental Figure 1K). We observed no reduction of TNF 
or MHC-II in the Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice that were not treated with 
tamoxifen after allo-HCT in comparison with Tak1fl/fl mice that 
underwent allo-HCT (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B).
The TAK1-deletion effect was restricted to the CNS, as 
GVHD-related mortality was not different when Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl
mice and littermates were compared (Figure 5K). Consistent with 
similar survival rates, the histopathological scoring of peripher￾al GVHD organs including small intestines, large intestines, and 
liver was not different between Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice and litter￾mate controls (Supplemental Figure 2, C–E).
However, consistent with improved neurocognitive function, 
Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice exhibited higher exploratory activity in the 
elevated plus maze test compared with littermate controls (Fig￾ure 5L). Additionally, the novel object recognition test showed 
that Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice had a better recognition memory 
compared with controls (Figure 5M). The differences in motoric 
function were not due to a general weakness of the mice, as the 
Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice and controls exhibited similar grip strength 
(Figure 5N). Also, the neurocognitive differences were not due to a 
loss of vision, as the Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice and controls exhibited 
similar results in the visual cliff test (Supplemental Figure 2F).
These findings indicate that a selective deletion of TAK1 in 
CX3CR1+
 microglia reduces inflammatory T cell infiltration into the 
brain, reduces numbers of Iba-1+
 microglia, reduces MHC-II and 
TNF expression by microglia, and promotes neurocognitive function 
of mice developing GVHD without blocking peripheral GVHD.
Therapeutic TAK1 inhibition reduces inflammatory features of 
microglia during CNS-GVHD. To test for a potentially translation￾al approach, we next treated mice with 2 different TAK1 inhibi￾tors, takinib and (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol, in comparison with vehicle 
and then analyzed the CNS. We observed that TAK1 inhibition 
reduced the expression of MHC-II and TNF compared with the 
vehicle treatment (Figure 6, A–D). Additionally, TAK1 inhibition 
reduced the number of CD3+
 T cells and Iba-1+
 microglia in com￾parison with the vehicle group (Figure 6, E–I).
In addition to the decreased accumulation of total CD3+
 T 
cells in the CNS upon TAK1 inhibition, we observed a decrease of 
CD4+
IFN-γ+
 T cells (Th1 cells) and CD4+
IL-17+
 T cells (Th17 cells) 
in the CNS of mice undergoing allo-HCT upon TAK1 inhibition 
compared with the vehicle group (Figure 6, J–M). Other T cell 
subpopulations, including naive T cells, central memory T cells, 
effector memory T cells, and CD4+
IL-4+
 T cells (Th2 cells), were 
not different in the takinib group compared with the vehicle group 
(Supplemental Figure 3, A–D). We observed a nonsignificant trend 
toward an increase of CD4+
FoxP3+
 T regulatory cells in the CNS of 
mice undergoing allo-HCT upon TAK1 inhibition compared with 
the vehicle group (Supplemental Figure 3E).
To understand why T cell infiltration was reduced in the CNS 
of mice that were treated with the TAK1 inhibitor or lacking TNF 
in CX3CR1+
 cells, we studied molecules that are required for T cell 
extravasation. T cell adhesion to endothelial cells is mediated via 
VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (11), which then allows T cells to exit the ves￾sel and enter the CNS.
We found reduced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on 
endothelial cells (CD31+
 CD105+
) in the CNS of mice treated with 
takinib compared with mice treated with vehicle (Figure 7, A–E, 
and Supplemental Figure 4). We also found a reduced number 
of VCAM-1+
 endothelial cells in the CNS of Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/– mice 
(TNF deletion) compared with Tnffl/–
 (no TNF deletion) mice 
(Figure 7, F and G). These findings support the concept that the 
TAK1/TNF axis promotes VCAM-1 expression on endothelial 
cells. Genetic deletion of TNF or TAK1 inhibition reduces VCAM￾1 expression during CNS-GVHD.
These findings in the CNS of TAK1 inhibitor–treated mice 
were connected to improved neurocognitive function, as the TAK1 
inhibitor group exhibited more frequent entries into open arm in 
the elevated plus maze test compared with the vehicle group (Figure 
7H). The novel object recognition test showed that the TAK1 inhib￾itor–treated group performed better compared with the vehicle￾treated group (Figure 7I). The differences in motoric function 
were not due to a general weakness of the TAK1 inhibitor–treated 
mice, as they exhibited similar grip strength (Supplemental Figure 
5A). Also, the neurocognitive differences were not due to a loss of 
vision, as the TAK1 inhibitor–treated mice and the vehicle-treated 
mice exhibited similar results in the visual cliff test (Supplemental 
Figure 5B). In order to be potentially applicable in a clinical set￾ting, engraftment of the donor hematopoietic system is essential. 
We observed that the TAK1 inhibitor–treated mice and the vehi￾cle-treated mice exhibited similar engraftment (Supplemental 
Figure 5C), while there was no change of GVHD scores in the 
small and large bowels but a reduced liver GVHD score in the TAK 
inhibitor–treated mice (Supplemental Figure 5, D–F). TAK1 inhibi￾tor–treated animals exhibited a lower frequency of monocyte infil￾trates or activated microglia compared with vehicle-treated mice 
(Supplemental Figure 5, G and H).
To evaluate the impact of takinib treatment on graft-ver￾sus-leukemia (GVL) activity, we used a genetic acute myeloid leu￾kemia (AML) model (FLT3-ITD/MLL-PTD) and a cell line–based 
AML model (WEHI-3B) (12). The AML cells were on the same 
genetic background as the recipient mice to mimic the clinical sit￾uation. In both models the group that received T cells experienced 
improved survival compared with the group that received AML 
cells and bone marrow only, indicating the GVL effect. The treat￾ment with takinib did not reduce the GVL effect in both leukemia 
models (Figure 7, J and K).
Microglia cells expand and produce TNF in human CNS-GVHD. 
To understand whether patients developing acute GVHD had 
changes in microglia cells comparable to those we had observed 
in mice, we studied the brains of patients who died after allo-HCT. 
We observed an increased number of Iba-1+
 microglia in patients 
who developed acute GVHD compared with patients who under￾went allo-HCT but did not develop GVHD. The increase was 
found in gray and white matter of the frontal lobe (Figure 8, A–D).

GVHD grade II–IV was independently associated with increased 
risk of noninfectious neurological complications with a hazard 
ratio of 3.3 and P less than 0.00001.
Despite these reports, it is important that other diseases such 
as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or viral encepha￾litis (e.g., herpes simplex virus, CMV, or varicella zoster virus) be 
ruled out before CNS-GVHD is diagnosed in a patient with GVHD 
developing neurological symptoms.
Discussion
The clinical picture of acute GVHD is often connected to neurolog￾ical deficits in patients, morphological CNS white matter changes 
detectable by MRI, and intraparenchymal lymphocytic infiltration 
of the brain upon autopsy (5, 14).
While previous work had shown that T cells contribute to 
CNS-GVHD (2, 3), the role of microglia cells had not been studied. 
We have previously extended the concept that GVHD is a purely 
T cell–mediated disease by showing that myeloid cells including 
neutrophils (15) and monocytes (16) contribute to GVHD devel￾opment by tissue damage and MHC-II–dependent antigen pre￾sentation (17). Here we show that microglia, a prototypical tissue 
macrophage population in the CNS, contribute significantly to the 
pathogenesis of CNS-GVHD.
Our first observation that microglia cells exhibit an activat￾ed phenotype during GVHD with reduced numbers of branch￾es is consistent with findings in CNS autoimmunity models 
describing this phenotype when experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) evolves (6). Our observation that 
CX3CR1 expression on microglia declined during GVHD is con￾sistent with reports showing high CX3CR1 expression on rest￾ing microglia and a decline upon microglia activation (7). The 
morphological microglia changes occurred in parallel with the 
upregulation of MHC-II and CD80, which allow for antigen 
presentation to donor T cells and costimulation of these T cells, 
respectively. In agreement with this concept in CNS-GVHD, it 
was shown that non-hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells 
also contribute to peripheral GVHD, while classical dendritic 
cells were dispensable (18). Comparable to our findings in CNS￾GVHD, others have shown in EAE that myeloid antigen-present￾ing cells are recruited to the brain, which correlated with disease 
severity (19, 20), and that these cells present antigen to autore￾active T cells to mediate CNS inflammation (21).
In addition, we found increased levels of TNF in microglia 
during CNS-GVHD. TNF has direct cytotoxic effects on cells 
during GVHD (22), which could be responsible for the neuronal 
death observed previously after allo-HCT (2). Consistent with the 
concept that TNF plays a major role in CNS-GVHD, we found that 
T cell infiltration into the CNS and MHC-II expression on micro￾glia were reduced when microglia cells were deficient in TNF.
We observed that TNF also increased in the syn-HCT group, 
although not to the same extent as in the allo-HCT group, which 
is likely due to the total-body irradiation–induced damage. The 
observation that CD3+
 T cells were not increased in the syn-HCT 
groups indicates that a higher level of TNF may be required to 
attract T cells to the CNS, as was the case in the allo-HCT group.
Our finding that Th1 and Th17 cells declined in the CNS upon 
TAK1 inhibition is compatible with findings in other models of 
frequency of TNF and Iba-1 double-positive microglia was sig￾nificantly increased in patients that had developed acute GVHD 
(Figure 8, E and F). In agreement with CNS-GVHD, these patients 
also exhibited higher CD3+
 T cell frequencies (Figure 8, G and H). 
These observations made in patient samples indicate that major 
findings made in the mouse model may also hold true for humans.
In addition, we reviewed the literature for cases of CNS￾GVHD and listed the reports in Supplemental Table 4. In the 
majority of the cases of CNS-GVHD the diagnosis was histolo￾gy-proven, supporting the concept that CNS-GVHD is a clinically 
relevant complication.
To further elucidate the potential clinical relevance of CNS￾GVHD, we analyzed the frequency of neurological symptoms that 
occurred at the same time that a patient developed acute GVHD 
grade II–IV in 503 patients undergoing allo-HCT at Freiburg Uni￾versity Hospital, Germany. Neurological symptoms related to 
infection or vascular events were not included. The time interval 
included the first 2 years after allo-HCT because acute GVHD 
occurs in 90% of all cases within this time interval. The multivari￾able logistic regression analysis included presence of acute GVHD 
grade II–IV, donor type (MRD, MUD, MMUD, haploidentical 
donor), conditioning (myeloablative versus reduced-intensity), 
sex, and age over 40 versus under 40 years as possible risk fac￾tors for the occurrence of neurological complications. We found 
that development of acute GVHD grade II–IV was independently 
associated with increased risk of noninfectious neurological com￾plications with an odds ratio of 491 and P less than 0.0001 (Sup￾plemental Tables 5 and 6). Our results are consistent with a recent 
retrospective analysis on the incidence and risk factors of nonin￾fectious neurological complications in 971 consecutive patients 
with hematological malignancies undergoing allo-HCT (13). The 
authors found in multivariable analysis that development of acute

TNF axis was connected to VCAM-1 expression on endothe￾lial cells. Genetic deletion of TNF or TAK1 inhibition reduced 
VCAM-1 expression during CNS-GVHD. T cell adhesion to 
endothelial cells is mediated via VCAM-1, which then allows T 
cells to exit the vessel and enter the CNS (11), supporting the 
concept that TAK1 inhibition reduced TNF and, subsequently, 
VCAM-1 expression, thereby decreasing donor T cell infiltra￾CNS inflammation. Th1 and Th17 cells were shown to be proin￾flammatory and to promote the development of EAE (23, 24).
In our studies we also identify increased TAK1 activation 
and NF-κB/p38 MAPK signaling activity in microglia during 
GVHD and show a functional role for TAK1, as selective Tak1
deletion in microglia reduced TNF production, T cell infiltrates 
in the CNS, and MHC-II levels. Mechanistically, the TAK1/

Statistics. For the sample size in the murine GVHD survival exper￾iments, a power analysis was performed. A sample size of at least n = 
8 per group was determined by 80% power to reach a statistical sig￾nificance of 0.05 to detect an effect size of at least 1.06. Differences 
in animal survival (Kaplan-Meier survival curves) were analyzed by 
Mantel-Cox test. The experiments were performed in a nonblinded 
fashion except for the GVHD severity scoring, the analysis of human 
tissue specimens, and behavioral experiments with the knockout 
mice. To obtain unbiased data, a pathologist blinded to both the 
genotype and the treatment group performed the histopathological 
scoring of GVHD severity. Only after finalization of the quantita￾tive GVHD severity scores were the samples allocated to their geno￾types/treatment group. Analysis of human brain specimens was also 
performed in a blinded manner, and the samples were allocated to 
the group after finalization of the analysis. All samples or mice were 
included in our analysis.
For statistical analysis of 2 groups, an unpaired 2-tailed Stu￾dent’s t test was applied. All data were tested for normality applying 
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the data did not meet the criteria 
of normality, the Mann-Whitney U test was applied. If more than 2 
groups were analyzed, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test if nonpara￾metric testing was suggested, and we performed a 1-way ANOVA 
in case of normally distributed data. Statistical analysis was per￾formed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Data are pre￾sented as mean and SEM (error bars). Differences were considered 
significant when the P value was less than 0.05.
Study approval. The study included formalin-fixed and paraf￾fin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens of different brain regions 
from patients who died of causes unrelated to allo-HCT, patients who 
died after allo-HCT without GVHD, and patients who died after allo￾HCT and had GVHD (grade 3–4). The study was approved by the local 
ethics committee (protocol 547/14; Ethics Committee, University of 
Freiburg). Patients who underwent autopsy within a time period of 16 
years (2001–2017) at the Institute of Neuropathology, Freiburg Uni￾versity Hospital, Germany, were analyzed. Patient characteristics are 
shown in Supplemental Tables 1–3.
A retrospective analysis of 503 patients undergoing allo-HCT 
at Freiburg University Medical Center with a follow-up of at least 12 
months was performed. The analysis was approved by the Institution￾al Ethics Review Board of Freiburg University Medical Center (pro￾tocols 10024/13, 26/11, and 509/16). Written informed consent was 
obtained from each patient. All analyses of human data were carried 
out in compliance with the relevant ethical regulations. The analysis 
included neurological symptoms that occurred at the same time that 
a patient developed acute GVHD grade II–IV. Neurological symptoms 
related to infection or vascular events were not included. The obser￾vation time interval included the first 2 years after allo-HCT because 
acute GVHD occurs in 90% of all cases within this time interval. The 
multivariable logistic regression analysis included presence of acute 
GVHD grade II–IV, donor type (MRD, MUD, MMUD, haploidentical 
donor), conditioning (myeloablative versus reduced-intensity condi￾tioning), sex, and age over 40 versus under 40 years as possible risk 
factors for the occurrence of neurological complications. Patient char￾acteristics are provided in Supplemental Tables 5 and 6.
Animal protocols (protocols G-13/045, G13-116, G-15/018, 
G-17/063, X-13/07J, and X-15/10A) were approved by the Regierung￾spräsidium Freiburg (regional council), Freiburg, Germany (Federal 
tion into the CNS. Consistent with a functional role for TAK1 in 
CNS-GVHD, the neurocognitive function of mice lacking TAK1 
in microglia was improved. Besides the genetic Tak1 deletion 
approach, we also show that pharmacological TAK1 inhibition 
reduced TNF production and MHC-II expression by microglia 
cells and improved neurocognitive activity. Our previous work 
using Janus kinase inhibitors has shown the high potential of 
kinase inhibition to prevent or treat GVHD in mice (25) and 
patients (26). Our findings are potentially clinically relevant as 
treatment with the TAK1 inhibitor takinib did not affect GVL 
effects in 2 AML models. In agreement with the functional role 
of microglia-derived TNF for CNS-GVHD in mice, we observed 
an increase of the microglia cell number and their TNF produc￾tion in the CNS of patients who developed GVHD.
In aggregate, we report a role for microglia in CNS-GVHD and 
identify the TAK1/TNF/MHC-II axis as a central mediator of this 
disease. Additionally, we provide a serine-threonine kinase inhib￾itor–based approach against GVHD-induced neurotoxicity identi￾fied based on RNA-Seq analysis of the CNS.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6 (H-2Kb, Thy-1.2) and BALB/c (H-2Kd, Thy-1.2) mice 
were purchased either from Janvier Labs (France) or from the local 
stock of the animal facility at the University of Freiburg. Tak1fl/fl
and Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl (6), Cx3cr1creER R26-yfp (6), CCR2–/– (27), and 
Cx3cr1creER R26-Tomato reporter mice were bred in the animal facility 
at the University of Freiburg. Tnffl/– and Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/– (27) mice were 
bred at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. Mice were 
used between 6 and 14 weeks of age, and only female or male donor/
recipient pairs were used.
Bone marrow transplantation model and histopathology scoring. 
Bone marrow transplantation experiments were performed as previ￾ously described (12, 28). Briefly, recipients were exposed to lethal irra￾diation of 9–11 Gy. CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells were isolated from donor 
spleens and enriched by positive selection with the MACS cell separa￾tion system (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 MicroBeads were used. Alternatively, 
T cells were isolated from donor spleens by negative selection (Pan T 
Cell Isolation Kit-II), with the MACS cell separation system (Miltenyi 
Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CD4+
/CD8+
 T 
cell purity was at least 90% as assessed by flow cytometry (data not 
shown). To induce GVHD, 5 × 106 bone marrow cells and CD4+
/CD8+
T cells from an MHC-mismatched donor (allogeneic stem cell trans￾plantation) were given at a dosage of 3 × 105
 (C57BL/6-derived into 
BALB/c) or 8 × 105
 (BALB/c-derived into C57BL/6) i.v. on day 0. For 
behavioral studies, a sublethal dose of 5 × 105
 BALB/c-derived T cells 
was used. As a control, syngeneic stem cell transplantation (syn-HCT) 
was performed by injection of the same amount of bone marrow and T 
cells from a donor mouse with the same genetic background as that of 
the recipient. Slides of small intestine, large intestine, and liver speci￾mens collected after allo-HCT were stained with H&E and scored by 
an experienced pathologist blinded to the treatment groups. GVHD 
severity was determined according to a previously published histopa￾thology scoring system (29).
RNA-Seq data were deposited in the NCBI’s Gene Expression 
Omnibus database (GEO GSE141663). All antibodies are listed in Sup￾plemental Table 7.

Author contributions
NRM and JMV performed the majority of the murine and cell 
line experiments and helped to develop the overall concept 
and write the manuscript. NRM and JMV are co–first authors. 
Their order in the author list was based on the first key exper￾iments, which were performed and analyzed by NRM. PA, DE, 
and GI collected and analyzed patient samples. JSK performed 
cell sorting. SH, KH, NEK, DS, and TG helped with in vivo 
experiments. GA, MB, and LCM performed RNA sequencing 
and analyzed the data. TB helped to develop the concept and 
provided help with behavioral studies in mice. JD, JF, BRB, 
SJ, and MP contributed to critical analysis of the data, devel￾oped concepts, and provided reagents. RZ developed the over￾all concept, supervised the experiments, analyzed data, and 
wrote the manuscript.
