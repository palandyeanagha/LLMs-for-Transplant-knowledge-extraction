INTRODUCTION 
 Following injury it is paramount that tissue architecture is 
restored to regain normal organ function. Acute inflammatory 
responses that result from infection or injury can disrupt epithe￾lial and endothelial integrity leading to edema, the recruitment 
of leukocytes and angiogenesis. The resolution of inflammation 
through apoptotic and phagocytic pathways often leaves mini￾mal damage and restores normal tissue architecture. However, 
common to most fibrotic conditions is the presence of a persist￾ent irritant, which can be known agents, such as allergens, toxic 
chemicals, radiation, or other persistent irritants or unknown 
factors that trigger idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Indeed, 
a dysregulated healing response can gradually evolve into a path￾ogenic fibrotic response when important checkpoints are missed 
and inflammation becomes unrelenting. These processes can 
result in a local milieu rich in chemokines, pro-inflammatory, 
angiogenic, and fibrogenic cytokines, growth factors and tissue 
destructive enzymes. 1 – 3 This m é lange of dysregulated processes 
can result in an increased accumulation of extracellular matrix 
(ECM) components and fibrotic lesions. Concurrent inflam￾mation, tissue destruction and tissue regeneration can present 
a “ perfect storm ” of damage and regeneration. 
 A tightly regulated repair response following tissue injury 
is therefore critical. A well-coordinated influx of cells replace 
resident tissue cells, supply essential nutrients, and reform 
the tissue during a regenerative period. In some cases, this is 
followed by a period of fibroplasia, with too much extracellular 
matrix deposition and connective tissue formation. These events 
are often associated with vascular diseases and can give rise 
to many clinical conditions such as atherosclerosis, cirrhosis, 
scleroderma, asthma, and various types of pulmonary fibrosis. 
The regenerative process following tissue damage, despite hav￾ing common mechanisms, can lead to various organ-specific 
disorders. This review will focus on pulmonary fibrotic 
conditions and, if known, present common regulatory 
mechanisms across diseases. 
 The prevalence and incidence of pulmonary fibrotic diseases 
are hard to estimate, given the vast array of clinical conditions.

Pulmonary fibrosis: pathogenesis, etiology and 
regulation 
 MS Wilson 1 and TA Wynn 1 
Pulmonary fibrosis and architectural remodeling of tissues can severely disrupt lung function, often with fatal 
consequences. The etiology of pulmonary fibrotic diseases is varied, with an array of triggers including allergens, 
chemicals, radiation and environmental particles. However, the cause of one of the most common pulmonary fibrotic 
conditions, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is still unclear. This review examines common mechanisms of pulmonary 
wound-healing responses following lung injury, and highlights the pathogenesis of some of the most widespread 
pulmonary fibrotic diseases. A three phase model of wound repair is reviewed that includes; (1) injury; (2) inflammation; 
and (3) repair. In most pulmonary fibrotic conditions dysregulation at one or more of these phases has been reported. 
Chronic inflammation can lead to an imbalance in the production of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and disrupt 
cellular recruitment. These changes coupled with excessive pro-fibrotic IL-13 and / or TGF 1 production can turn a well￾controlled healing response into a pathogenic fibrotic response. Endogenous regulatory mechanisms are discussed 
including novel areas of therapeutic intervention. Restoring homeostasis to these dysregulated healing responses, or 
simply neutralizing the key pro-fibrotic mediators may prevent or slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

cystic lung disease, scleroderma, radiation and chemotherapy￾induced fibrosis, granulomatous lung disease, sarcoidosis and 
environmental, and smoking-associated COPD. These fibrotic 
conditions are frequently fatal, with a median survival time fol￾lowing diagnosis of 3 – 5 years in the case of IPF. 6
MECHANISMS OF WOUND HEALING AND FIBROSIS 
 A wound-healing response is often described as having three 
distinct phases — injury, inflammation and repair ( Figure 1 ). 
Although not all pulmonary fibrotic conditions follow this sim￾ple paradigm, it has been a useful model to elucidate the com￾mon and divergent mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis. 
Phase I: injury 
 Injury caused by autoimmune or allergic reactions, environmen￾tal particulates, infection or mechanical damage often results in 
the disruption of normal tissue architecture, initiating a healing 
response. Inflammation following insult, can also contribute to 
cellular damage and tissue destruction. Damaged epithelial and 
endothelial cells must be replaced to maintain barrier function 
and integrity and prevent blood loss, respectively. Acute damage 
to endothelial cells leads to the release of inflammatory media￾tors and initiation of an anti-fibrinolytic coagulation cascade, 7
temporarily plugging the damaged vessel with a platelet and 
fibrin-rich clot. Lung homogenates, epithelial cells or BAL fluid 8
from IPF patients express greater levels of the platelet-differen￾tiating factor, X-box-binding protein-1, compared with COPD 
and control patients, 9 suggesting that clot-forming responses 
are continuously activated. In addition, thrombin (a serine pro￾tease required to convert fibrinogen into fibrin) is also readily 
detected within the lung and intra-alveolar spaces of several 
pulmonary fibrotic conditions, 10 – 12 further confirming the 
Figure 1 Phases of wound healing. A three-phase injury and wound-healing model describes distinct phases of a successful response. (1) Injury; 
many agents can cause pulmonary injury, including environmental particles, allergens, infectious agents, chemotherapy and radiation. Disruption of 
epithelial and endothelial cells initiate an anti-fibrinolytic cascade, temporarily plugging the affected tissue. (2) Inflammation; circulating inflammatory 
cells and fibrocytes are recruited to the injured site through chemokine gradients, supplying fibroblast-activating cytokines and growth factors. Neo￾vascularization provides access to damaged areas and a steady stream of inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and phagocytic cells. (3) Fibroblasts 
contract and decrease the size of the wound. Inflammatory cells and -SMA +myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis, terminating collagen deposition, and 
are cleared by phagocytic cells. Epithelial and endothelial cells are replaced and tissue architecture is restored.

activation of the clotting pathway. Thrombin can also directly 
activate fibroblasts, 13 increasing proliferation and promoting 
fibroblast differentiation into collagen-producing myofibrob￾lasts. 14,15 Damage to the airway epithelium, specifically alveolar 
pneumocytes 16 can evoke a similar anti-fibrinolytic cascade and 
lead to interstitial edema, areas of acute inflammation and sepa￾ration of the epithelium from the basement membrane. 17
 Platelet recruitment, degranulation and clot formation rapidly 
progress into a phase of vasodilation with increased permeabil￾ity, 18 allowing the extravasation and direct recruitment of leuko￾cytes to the injured site. The basement membrane, which forms 
the ECM underlying the epithelium and endothelium of paren￾chymal tissue, precludes direct access to the damaged tissue. To 
disrupt this physical barrier, zinc-dependent endopeptidases, 
also called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cleave one or 
more ECM constituents allowing extravasation of cells into, and 
out of, damaged sites. Specifically, MMP-2 (gelatinase A, Type 
N collagenase) and MMP-9 (Gelatinase B, Type IV collagenase) 
cleave type N collagens and gelatin, two important constituents 
of the basement membrane. 19 – 21 In the majority of studies, but 
not all, 22 MMP-2 and MMP-9 are upregulated 23 – 26 highlighting 
the tissue destructive and regenerative processes common in 
fibrotic conditions. 
 The precise function of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was elegantly 
demonstrated in a model of allergic airway inflammation and 
remodeling with MMP-2 − / − , MMP-9 − / − and MMP-2 − / − MMP￾9 − / − double knockout mice. 27,28 In these studies, the authors 
demonstrated that MMP-2, and more importantly MMP-9, were 
required for successful egression and clearance of inflammatory 
cells out of the inflamed tissue and into the airspaces. In the 
absence of these MMPs, cells were trapped within the paren￾chyma of the lung and were not able to move into the airspaces, 
which resulted in fatal asphyxiation. 
 The activities of MMPs are controlled by several mechanisms 
including transcriptional regulation, proenzyme regulation, and 
specific tissue inhibitors of MMPs. The balance between MMPs 
and the various inhibitory mechanisms can regulate inflamma￾tion and determine the net amount of collagen deposited during 
the healing response. 4
Phase II: inflammation 
 Once access to the site of tissue damage has been achieved, 
chemokine gradients recruit inflammatory cells. Neutrophils, 
eosinophils, 29 lymphocytes, and macrophages are observed 
at sites of acute injury with cell debris and areas of necrosis 
cleared by phagocytes. The influence of specific inflammatory 
cells on downstream fibrosis, particularly in IPF, is controversial 
( 30 – 32 and was recently reviewed 33 ). One school of thought stems 
from the observation that anti-inflammatory agents have lit￾tle efficacy in the treatment of IPF 34 – 36 and usual interstitial 
pneumonia patients. Based on these observations, many inves￾tigators have suggested that inflammation per se may not be a 
contributing factor in fibrosis. However, we believe the con￾troversy reflects our limited knowledge and insight into the 
causative agent(s) and mechanisms involved in IPF. The timing 
of inflammatory events may determine the role played by the 
inflammatory process. Early inflammation that is diminished at 
the later stages of disease may promote wound healing and may 
contribute to fibrosis. For example the early recruitment of eosi￾nophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages providing 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can contribute to local 
TGF  and IL-13. 37 – 41 However, following the initial insult and 
wave of inflammatory cells, a late-stage recruitment of inflam￾matory cells may assist in phagocytosis, clear cell debris, and 
control excessive cellular proliferation, which together may 
contribute to normal healing. Thus late-stage inflammation 
may in fact serve an anti-fibrotic role and could be required 
for successful resolution of wound-healing responses. For 
example a late-phase inflammatory profile rich in phagocytic 
macrophages, 42 assisting in fibroblast clearance, in addition to 
IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells, suppressing local chemok￾ine production and TGF  , 
43 may prevent excessive fibroblast 
activation. Thus, the absence of inflammation observed in IPF 
patients, 36 and interpretation that inflammation is not involved, 
may simply be a matter of timing. Indeed, corticosteroids that 
inhibit endogenous suppressive and phagocytic pathways may 
even be detrimental. However, It should not be forgotten that 
the mechanisms leading to pulmonary fibrosis are diverse, with 
immeasurable genetic, environmental and immunological inter￾actions regulating the entire process. 
 The nature of the insult or causative agent often dictates the 
character of the ensuing inflammatory response. For example, 
exogenous stimuli like pathogen-associated molecular pat￾terns (PAMPs) are recognized by pathogen recognition recep￾tors, such as toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors, and 
influence the response of innate cells to invading pathogens. 44
Endogenous danger signals 45 can also influence local innate cells 
and orchestrate the inflammatory cascade. For immunologists, 
classifying the type of immune response into Type-1 (Th1 cells, 
IFN  , TNF  , and IgG2 antibody responses, generally considered 
pro-inflammatory) Type 2 (Th2 cells, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE, 
generally considered as a wound-healing response) and type 17 
(Th17 cells, recently associated with pro-inflammatory condi￾tions) based upon the T helper cell-dominant cytokine responses, 
although often oversimplifying, allows for easier discussion. 
 The nature of the inflammatory response dramatically influ￾ences resident tissue cells and the ensuing inflammatory cells. 
Inflammatory cells themselves also propagate further inflamma￾tion through the secretion of chemokines, cytokines, and growth 
factors. Many cytokines are involved throughout a wound-heal￾ing and fibrotic response, with specific groups of genes activated 
in various conditions. For example, chronic allergic airway dis￾ease in asthmatics is commonly associated with elevated type-2 
cytokine profiles (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9, IL-3 46 ) whereas IPF 
patients more frequently present pro-inflammatory cytokine 
profiles (IL-1  , IL-1  , TNF  , TGF  , and platelet-derived growth 
factors (PDGF) 47 ). Among many cytokines in various pulmo￾nary fibrotic conditions, IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-  have received 
significant attention. Each of these cytokines can exhibit signifi￾cant pro-fibrotic activity, 48 – 51 acting through the recruitment, 
activation and proliferation of fibroblasts, macrophages, and 
myofibroblasts. 2

Type-2 inflammatory responses: pro-fibrotic IL-4 and IL-13 . 
IL-4, the archetypal type-2 cytokine, has been firmly established 
as a pro-fibrotic cytokine and is elevated in IPF, 52 cryptogenic 
fibrosing alveolitis, 53 radiation-induced pneumonitis and pul￾monary fibrosis 54 as well as liver fibrosis following infection 
with Schistomsoma mansoni.55 IL-4 receptors are present on 
lung fibroblasts 49 with IL-4 signaling increasing extra cellular 
matrix proteins and collagen deposition. Surprisingly, some 
studies have suggested that IL-4 is superior to TGF-  1 at induc￾ing collagen synthesis from fibroblasts. 49 Indirect mechanisms 
of IL-4 include its ability to promote the alternative activation of 
macrophages (AA-Mac), identified by the expression of argin￾ase, 56 Fizz-1, 57 Ym-1, 58 and mannose receptors. 59 Macrophages 
in general have long been associated with pulmonary fibrosis. 
However, the precise mechanisms and functions of AA-Macs 
in pulmonary fibrosis are only now being dissected. AA-Macs 
can produce TGF-  , PDGF 60 and, through arginase upregula￾tion, modulate polyamine and proline biosynthesis, cell growth, 
and collagen formation. 61 AA-Macs have been isolated and cul￾tured from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of IPF patients, 62
with culture supernatants from these AA-Macs significantly 
increasing collagen production by normal human fibroblasts 
in a CCL18-dependent manner. Animal studies have also identi￾fied the involvement of AA-Macs in several models of fibrosis, 
including mice overexpressing human TGF  in the lung, 63 in 
human and animal studies of dystrophic muscle fibrosis 64 and 
in multiple organ fibrosis following infection of IFN  R − / − mice 
with  herpes virus. 65 Although not identified as AA-Macs, mac￾rophages in general have long been appreciated in human 66 and 
animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. 67 – 69 Together these data 
suggested that direct secretion of TGF  , PDGF and proline by 
AA-Macs are just a few of the many ways in which AA-Macs 
influence the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Finally, one of the most renowned properties of IL-4 is its abil￾ity to promote the differentiation of T cells into Th2 cells, pro￾viding a source of many type-2 cytokines in this inflammatory 
axis (IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-21). The Th2 cytokines interact 
in dramatic ways propagating wound healing and potentially 
pro-fibrotic responses. For example, IL-5 mobilizes, matures, 
and recruits eosinophils, 70 with IL-4 promoting TGF-  produc￾tion from eosinophils. 37 IL-5 can also augment IL-13 production 
and increase IL-13-dependent fibrosis. 71 IL-9 can selectively 
recruit and activate mast cells, 72 with mast-cell-derived chy￾mase increasing TGF  activity and contributing to pulmonary 
fibrosis. 73 Mast cells can also promote fibroblast proliferation, 
collagen, and MMP production, 74 and may be involved in sub￾epithelial fibrosis following allergen challenge. 75 IL-21 can also 
amplify Th2 pulmonary responses and IL-13-associated fibrosis 
by upregulating IL-4 / IL-13 receptor expression. Mice deficient 
in the IL-21R showed reduced IL-13-dependent fibrosis follow￾ing S. mansoni infection 76 and reduced IL-13-mediated AHR in 
a murine model of asthma, suggesting it may be an important 
regulator of Th2-driven remodeling in the lung. 77
 IL-13 shares many properties with IL-4, due to common 
receptor subunits (IL-4R  ), signal transduction pathways and 
transcription factors (STAT-6). However, recent animal studies 
have identified IL-4R  - 78 and STAT-6 79 -independent IL-13-
associated responses, which may involve IL-13 signaling through 
IL-13R  2. 80 – 82 Despite the common properties between IL-4 
and IL-13, IL-13 has been identified as a key fibrogenic cytokine 
in many fibrotic conditions ( 83 , reviewed in 51 ) and can function 
independently of TGF-  . 
84 IL-13 can trigger the differentiation 
of fibroblasts into  -smooth muscle actin (  -SMA) expressing 
myofibroblasts and PDGF-producing cells 85 with significant 
mitogenic properties. Interestingly, IL-13-mediated differen￾tiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is refractory to steroid 
inhibition, which may explain why steroids are not effective at 
inhibiting fibrosis. 
 Pro-fibrotic IL-13 has been widely studied in animal models, 
where gain of function experiments using a novel transgenic 
approach (overexpressing IL-13), led to subepithelial fibrosis 
accompanied by eosinophilic inflammation and mucus pro￾duction, 86 comparable to allergen-induced airway responses. 
Similarly, loss of function studies, blocking or germ line deletion 
of IL-13 but not IL-4, reduced collagen deposition following 
exposure to aspergillus, 87 OVA, 88 bleomycin 89,90 and FITC. 91
It is important to note that the pro-fibrotic properties of IL-13 
are not restricted to the lung, because hepatic fibrosis, follow￾ing infection with Schistomsoma mansoni is also significantly 
decreased following IL-13 blockade. 91
In vitro culture of normal human fibroblasts with normal 
human epithelial cells, which were pre-treated with IL-13, 
produced significantly more TGF-  , soluble and fibrillar col￾lagen, 92 supporting the notion that IL-13 can both directly and 
indirectly promote collagen production by fibroblasts. Indeed, 
fibroblasts isolated from IPF patients 93 and allergic asthmat￾ics 94 demonstrate a hyper-responsiveness to IL-13, as well as 
TGF  and CCL-2, with significant interplay between these three 
mediators. 93 Several animal studies also propose a model where 
IL-13, through various receptor subunits 80,81 can induce plas￾minogen activator and MMP-9, enhancing the release of active 
TGF 95 and subsequent fibrosis. Together these human and ani￾mal studies indicate a coordinated and potentially combined 
effect of IL-13 and TGF  on fibroblast activation and collagen 
deposition. 40
Involvement of TGF  in pulmonary fibrosis . TGF  is derived 
from most cell lineages derived from the bone marrow 96 includ￾ing T cells, macrophages, 97 eosinophils, and neutrophils 98 and 
is one of the most widely studied pro-fibrotic cytokines. The 
potent activity of TGF  is regulated at the post-transcriptional 
level by a latency-associated protein (LAP), which keeps TGF 
in an inactive state. Dissociation of TGF  from LAP is achieved 
by many agents commonly found in fibrotic conditions, includ￾ing cathepsins, plasmin, 99 calpain, 100 thromombospondin, 96
integrin  v  6, 101 and MMPs. 102 These agents trigger the release 
of biologically active TGF  . Once active, TGF  is incredibly 
pleiotropic with growth and chemotactic properties, stimu￾lating fibroblast proliferation and the synthesis of extracellu￾lar matrix proteins, 50 recruiting inflammatory cells through 
MCP-1 (CCL2) 103 and suppressing T-cell responses. The various 
and often opposing functions of TGF  are likely explained by 
its various sources and cellular targets. 104 The inhibitory and

suppressive properties of TGF  were reviewed elsewhere, 105 – 107
whereas this review focuses on the pro-fibrotic properties of 
TGF  . 
 Similar to the approach employed to study IL-13-mediated 
fibrosis in the lung, 86 active TGF  has also been overexpressed 
in the lungs of mice, with the development of severe interstitial 
and pleural fibrosis, consisting of excess collagen deposition, 
extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin, elastin, and the pres￾ence of myofibroblasts. 108 Interestingly, unlike IL-13 overexpres￾sion, TGF  did not recruit inflammatory cells or enhance mucus 
secretion in the lung, suggesting that TGF  can directly induce 
fibrosis in the absence of significant inflammation. Inhibiting 
TGF  activity, by interfering with SMAD-mediated signaling, 109
significantly reduced dermal, 110,111 renal, 112 – 114 ocular, 115
and pulmonary fibrosis. 116,117 As mentioned above, TGF  -
independent 84,118,119 as well as TGF  - and IL-13-combined 
mechanisms can contribute to wound healing and fibrosis. 
Knowledge of the precise interactions and non-redundant com￾pensatory pathways in addition to disease-specific dominance 
of IL-13 and / or TGF  could significantly improve therapeutic 
options. 
Chemokine cocktails in the fibrotic lung . Cytokine-producing 
cells are efficiently recruited to sites of injury through chem￾okine gradients. Many chemokine gradients develop during 
wound-healing responses, each recruiting specific chemokine 
receptor-bearing cells; however, the CC and CXC chemok￾ine families have received considerable attention in fibrotic 
responses. For example, eosinophils bearing CCR3 and follow￾ing CCL11 (Eotaxin) gradients and neutrophils, macrophages 
and monocytes, bearing CCR2 and following IL-8 (KC in mice), 
IL-17, CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL3 (MIP1  ) gradients 120 have 
all been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis. CCL2, CCL3, and 
CCL11 are themselves upregulated in pulmonary fibrotic condi￾tions, 121 – 127 with gene-deficient animal models confirming their 
importance. 124,128,129 However, a previously underappreciated 
circulating cell, the fibrocyte, expressing CCR2, 130 CCR3, 131
CCR5, 132 and CCR7, 131 as well as CXCR4, 133 represents a sig￾nificant population of collagen-producing cells. 134 The discov￾ery of a rapid, ready, and plentiful supply of collagen-producing 
fibrocytes from the bone marrow adds a new dimension to 
pulmonary wound repair and fibrosis. 135,136 Currently, there 
are three potential origins of  -SMA + myofibroblasts in lung 
fibrosis; (1) resident interstitial fibroblasts differentiating into 
collagen-secreting and extracellular matrix producing cells; (2) 
a process of epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) 
where local epithelial cells adopt fibroblast-like properties 
and (3) the extravasation of circulating fibrocytes, originating 
from the bone marrow and differentiating in the tissue into 
myofibroblasts. 137
 During chronic injury, endothelial cells enter a process of 
vasculogenesis ( de-novo blood vessel formation) and angiogen￾esis (budding of new capillary branches from existing blood 
vessels), 138 laying down dense vascular beds permeating fibrotic 
and regenerative tissue. Angiogenesis can be controlled by 
several angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor, TGF  , PDGF, 
angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and a vast array of cytokines 139 and 
chemokines. 137
 In particular, CXC chemokines identified as angiogenic or 
angiostatic by their amino terminus, 3-aa sequence (Glu-Leu￾Arg), known as the ELR motif, regulate the degree of neo-vas￾cularization and remodeling. In general ELR + CXC chemokines 
(CXCL1, 2, 3, 5, and 8), which bind to CXCR2, are angiogenic 
and ELR − CXC chemokines (CXCL4, 9, 10, and 11), which 
bind to CXCR3, are angiostatic. BAL fluid from IPF patients 
is rich in ELR + CXC chemokines with a relative downregula￾tion of ELR − CXC chemokines. 139 – 141 Imbalanced ELR + and 
ELR − CXC chemokine levels have also been observed in animal 
models of pulmonary fibrosis, 142 – 144 confirming observations 
made in patients. 
 In summary, inflammation and the recruitment of circulat￾ing granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and 
fibrocytes, presents a continuous supply of pro- and anti-fibrotic 
players, vital for efficient wound repair but potentially deadly 
when not adequately controlled. Every step of this pathway 
requires negative feedback loops that evoke significant control 
over the entire process. An imbalance in chemokine produc￾tion coupled with dysregulated cellular recruitment can result 
in an excess of pro-fibrotic IL-13 or TGF  , a surplus of myofibro￾blasts, and can convert a normal wound-healing response into 
a pathological fibrotic reaction. 
Phase III: tissue repair and contraction 
 The closing phase of wound healing consists of an orchestrated 
cellular re-organization guided by a fibrin-rich scaffold forma￾tion, wound contraction, closure and re-epithelialization. The 
vast majority of studies elucidating the processes involved in this 
phase of wound repair have come from dermal wound studies 
and in vitro systems. For this reason, we will extrapolate these 
studies to the lung, where possible. 
 Myofibroblast-derived collagens and  -SMA form the pro￾visional extracellular matrix, with macrophage, platelet, and 
fibroblast-derived fibronectin 145,146 forming a fibrin scaffold. 
Collectively, these structures are commonly referred to as granu￾lation tissues. Primary fibroblasts or alveolar macrophages 147
isolated from IPF patients produce significantly more fibronec￾tin and  -SMA than control fibroblasts, 148 indicative of a state 
of heightened fibroblast activation. Interestingly, IPF patients 
undergoing steroid treatment had similar elevated levels of mac￾rophage-derived fibronectin as IPF patients without treatment. 
Thus, similar to steroid resistant IL-13-mediated myofibroblast 
differentiation, 85 macrophage-derived fibronectin release 147 also 
appears to be resistant to steroid treatment, providing another 
reason why steroid treatment may be ineffective. From animal 
models, fibronectin 149,150 appears to be required for the devel￾opment of pulmonary fibrosis, as mice with a specific deletion 
of extra type III domain of fibronectin (EDA) developed sig￾nificantly less fibrosis following bleomycin administration 148
compared with their wild-type counterparts. 
 In addition to fibronectin, the provisional extracellular matrix 
consists of glycoproteins (such as PDGF 151 ), glycosaminoglycans 
(such as Hyaluronic acid 152 ), proteoglycans, 153 and elastin. 154,155

Growth factor and TGF  -activated fibroblasts migrate along the 
extracellular matrix network and repair the wound. Within skin 
wounds, TGF  also induces a contractile response, regulating 
the orientation of collagen fibers. 156 Fibroblast to myofibroblast 
differentiation, as discussed above, also creates stress fibers and 
the neo-expression of  -SMA, 157 both of which confer the high 
contractile activity 158 within myofibroblasts. The attachment 
of myofibroblasts to the extracellular matrix at specialized sites 
called the “ fibronexus ” or “ super mature focal adhesions ” pull 
the wound together, reducing the size of the lesion during the 
contraction phase. 159 The degree of extracellular matrix laid 
down and, the quantity of activated myofibroblasts 160 deter￾mines the amount of collagen deposition. To this end, the bal￾ance of MMPs to TIMPs 161 – 163 and collagens to collagenases 
vary throughout the response, shifting from pro-synthesis and 
increased collagen deposition, towards a controlled balance, 
with no net increase in collagen. For successful wound healing, 
this balance often occurs when fibroblasts undergo apoptosis, 
inflammation begins to subside, and granulation tissue recedes, 
leaving a collagen-rich lesion. The removal of inflammatory cells 
and especially  -SMA + myofibroblasts is essential to terminate 
collagen deposition. 164 Interestingly, in IPF patients, the removal 
of fibroblasts can be delayed, with cells resistant to apoptotic 
signals, 165 – 167 despite the observation of elevated levels of the 
apoptosis inductor 9 and FAS-signaling molecules. 164 This rela￾tive resistance to apoptosis may potentially underlie this fibrotic 
disease. 160,168 However, it is important to note that several stud￾ies have also observed increased rates of collagen-secreting 
fibroblast and epithelial cell 169 apoptosis in IPF, 170 suggesting 
that yet another balance requires monitoring — that of fibroblast 
apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation. The signals which initiate 
fibroblast apoptosis in IPF, are not very well understood with 
several factors postulated, such as cytokine imbalances, genetic 
causes, and constitutive anti-apoptotic pathways 160,165,170,171
similar to some cancerous cells. 
 From skin studies, re-epithelialization of the wound site re￾establishes barrier function and allows encapsulated cellular 
re-organization. Several in vitro and in vivo172 models, using 
human 173 or rat 174 epithelial cells grown over a collagen matrix, 
or tracheal wounds in vivo , have identified significant stages of 
cell migration, proliferation, 175 and cell spreading. Rapid and 
dynamic motility and proliferation, with epithelial restitution 
from the edges of the denuded area 172,173,176 occur within hours 
of the initial wound. In addition, sliding sheets of epithelial cells 
can migrate over the injured area 177,178 assisting wound cover￾age. Several factors can regulate re-epithelialization with serum￾derived TGF 174 or MMP-7 179,180 (which itself is regulated by 
TIMP-1 181 ) appearing to play significant roles. 
 Collectively, the degree of inflammation, angiogenesis, and 
amount of extracellular matrix deposition all contribute to the 
net collagen deposition and ultimately whether a fibrotic lesion 
develops. Therapeutic intervention, interfering with fibroblast 
activation, proliferation or apoptosis requires a thorough under￾standing and appreciation of all of the phases of wound repair. 
Although these three phases are often presented sequentially, 
during chronic or repeated injury these processes function in 
parallel, placing significant demands on regulatory mecha￾nisms. 
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF COMMON PULMONARY 
FIBROTIC DISEASES 
 Alleviating symptoms is the primary concern of patients pre￾senting pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the etiology of pul￾monary fibrosis can provide long-term symptomatic relief and 
possible reversal of the disease. To this end, there are currently 
several well-known risk factors associated with pulmonary fibro￾sis that will be described below. In many cases, animal models 
have obvious advantages in studying the regulatory mechanisms 
in pulmonary fibrosis and airway remodeling. 
Cystic fibrosis and cystic lung disease 
 With regard to etiology, cystic fibrosis (CF) is unique among 
pulmonary fibrotic conditions and can be attributed to a single 
gene mutation making it the most common monogenic disease 
of Caucasians, affecting 1 in 2,500 – 4,000. 182
 CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 183 is the 
genetic “ Achilles heal ” responsible for the disease. The CFTR 
protein product is a chloride channel protein found in the 
membrane of cells lining the lungs, as well as the liver, pancreas, 
intestines, reproductive tract, and skin. 184 – 186 However, the lead￾ing cause of mortality in humans with CF is lung disease. 184
In addition to direct effects of CFTR mutations, resulting in 
deficient cAMP-mediated chloride secretion across epithelia 
and dysfunctional mucus regulation, CF patients are prone to 
progressive pulmonary damage, submucosal inflammation, and 
increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. 187 Long-term 
aerosolized antibiotics may limit bacterial colonization; 188 – 190
however, a consequence of chronic infection is recurring lung 
injury, chronic inflammation, 191,192 airway remodeling, 193 and 
fibrosis. The chronic inflammatory response, in particular the 
neutrophilic response, is a significant feature driving pathol￾ogy in CF. Gaggar et al . 
194 recently identified that neutrophil 
elastase, an enzyme that is significantly elevated in BAL fluid 
from CF patients, can promote pro-MMP9 and inhibit TIMP￾1, thereby disrupting the protease / anti-protease balance. 194 – 196
In addition, epithelial cell regeneration and repair may also 
be disrupted, accounting for altered lung physiology in CF. 197
Several cftr 
 − / − mice have been developed with varying degrees 
of lung disease, identifying CF-modifying genes within differ￾ent founding lines. 198 – 200 The monumental task of developing a 
mouse that spontaneously develops lung disease was achieved, 
allowing the pathophysiological dissection of murine CF. cftr 
 − / − 
mice develop parenchymal interstitial thickening and fibrosis 
with granulocyte influx, fibroblast infiltration and the deposition 
of matrix proteins. 199 The development of a mouse model of CF 
has allowed interesting studies addressing anti-inflammatory 
responses, 201 the involvement of modifier genes, 202,203 the impact 
of bacterial infection 204,205 and multi-organ complications. 206 
Radiation and chemotherapy-induced lung injury 
 Thoracic radiation therapy (RT) is used to treat lung, eosopha￾geal, breast, and lymphoid cancers. However, a common 

MucosalImmunology | VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2 | MARCH 2009 109
REVIEW
dose-limiting complication of RT is the development of pul￾monary interstitial injury and inflammation, often referred to 
as radiation pneumonitis and emergence of fibrotic foci. 207 – 209
Multiple mechanisms have been identified in RT-induced 
fibrosis, including alveolar damage, 210 increased reactive oxy￾gen species (ROS) and the toxic effects of ROS on parenchymal 
cells, 211,212 disruption of proliferation-associated transcription 
factors, 213 and the influx of inflammatory cells, such as mac￾rophages and lymphocytes. 214,215 Furthermore, dysregulated 
pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines, TGF  , IL-6, 
MMPs, 216 – 220 and chemokines, 221 in addition to reduced anti￾inflammatory cytokines following radiation 222 can further exac￾erbate the inflammatory and wound-healing response. Animal 
models have revealed genetic determinants of RT-induced fibro￾sis 213,223 corresponding with similar genotype-related associa￾tions in humans. 224 Collectively, RT of the thoracic region can 
cause significant damage to radiation-sensitive alveolar regions 
of the lung invoking a dysregulated inflammatory cascade, rich 
in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators. Dysregulated 
chemokines, transcription factors, and anti-inflammatory 
pathways can further compound this uncontrolled response, 
leading to pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Similar to radiation therapy, chemotherapy can cause lung 
injury with variable consequences depending on dose rate, 
duration, pre-existing lung disease, and concomitant steroid 
use. 225,226 The Streptomyces verticullatus -derived antibiotic, 
bleomycin (BLM), 227 is effective against squamous cell carci￾nomas and skin tumors; 228 however, like RT, an unfavorable side 
effect involves inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the lung. 
BLM-induced inflammation occurs in up to 46 % of patients 
treated 229 with complications in the lung and skin due to a lack 
of the endogenous bleomycin-inactivating enzyme, bleomycin 
hydrolase, in these tissues. 230
 Our understanding of BLM-induced fibrosis has been assisted 
by the development of animal models, which reproduce many, 
but not all, of the characteristics of the human disease. 230 BLM 
can directly cause cell death 231 and reduce O 2 into free radi￾cals, causing DNA breakage. 232 Depending upon the route of 
administration, epithelial and endothelial cells are some of the 
earliest cells affected, 233 causing a leukocyte-rich inflammatory 
response. Blockade of this inflammatory response in animal 
models, with anti-CD11 Ab-inhibiting cellular extravasation, 
dramatically reduced pulmonary collagen and fibrosis, dem￾onstrating the significant contribution of inflammatory cells on 
the resulting fibrotic response. 234 The inflammatory cytokines, 
TNF  , 
235 IL-1  , 
236 IL-6 237 and pro-fibrotic TGF 238,239 are 
accompanied by FAS-L-expressing cells, leading to more apop￾tosis. 16,240 Blockade of TNF  , IL-1, FAS-Ligand or TGF  can 
reduce the inflammatory and resultant fibrotic response fol￾lowing BLM administration. 235,240 – 242 Thus, TNF  , IL-1, IL-6, 
and TGF  are some of the possibly many mediators involved in 
BLM-induced fibrosis. The BLM model has been used to dissect 
the involvement of many cytokines in the pulmonary fibrotic 
response. The involvement of type-2 cytokines is less clear, with 
IL-4 and IL-5 playing no significant role, 243 – 245 whereas IL-13, 
either directly 90 or indirectly through TGF  , 
80,81 contributes 
to the fibrotic response. There is also evidence that Type-1 
cytokines are involved, 246 with fewer inflammatory cells, lung 
hydroxyproline content, weight loss, and mortality observed in 
IFN  − / − mice. 247 Blocking the IFN  -promoting cytokine IL-12 
or germ line deletion of IL-12 248 yielded similar results. 248 BLM, 
although invoking a significant inflammatory response, can also 
promote fibroblast proliferation 249 and TGF  production from 
endothelial cells 250 directly. Thus, BLM appears to have multiple 
properties, directly causing cell death and apoptosis, invoking an 
inflammatory response and promoting fibroblast proliferation 
and TGF  production. For these reasons, the mouse model of 
BLM-induced fibrosis provides a great tool to dissect the rela￾tive contribution of the many pathways, cells, and mediators 
involved in drug-induced fibrosis. 
Asthma and allergic airway inflammation 
 The number of individuals suffering from allergic airway 
inflammation and asthma has seen an unprecedented growth 
over the past 30 years, particularly within the urban areas of 
both developed and developing countries. 251 Allergic asthma 
is a polygenic disease, 252 characterized by allergen-specific IgE 
and IgG1, airway and interstitial eosinophilia, mucus secretion 
and airway hyper-reactivity. 253 Chronic asthma with repeated 
bouts of allergen exposure and dysregulated inflammation at 
mucosal surfaces can lead to goblet cell hyperplasia, smooth 
muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, angiogenesis and ulti￾mately subepithelial fibrosis. 254 – 257
 CD4 + Th2 cells orchestrate many aspects of the allergic 
inflammation, driven by dendritic cell or basophil-derived 
IL-4 and IL-25. 258 – 263 Activation and egression of cytokine￾secreting Th2 cells into the interstitium and mucosal surfaces 
of the lung propagate local cellular influx. More specifically, 
Th2-derived cytokines, IL-5 and IL-9, mobilize, mature and 
recruit eosinophils and mast cells 70,264,265 into the tissue and 
airspaces, and these cells are typically found in biopsies of asth￾matic individuals. TGF  is also significantly elevated in human 
asthmatics 41,266 – 270 with the degree of subepithelial fibrosis cor￾relating with a loss of forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ). These 
observations of increased eosinophils, TGF  and subepithelial 
fibrosis led Flood-page et al . 
271 to study the specific cellular 
source of TGF  . Indeed, 86 % of TGF  mRNA + cells in the 
bronchial mucosa of asthmatics were eosinophils, distinguish￾ing eosinophils as a significant source of pro-fibrotic TGF  in 
the allergic lung. 39 Furthermore, several studies have identified 
correlated collagen deposition with increased numbers of tissue 
eosinophils and myofibroblasts 19,38 as well as the expression of 
submucosal MMP9 and MMP12. 272
 These observations have led to several clinical trials and 
treatment regimens using anti-IL-5 antibodies to block tissue 
eosinophilia with few successes. Treatment of allergic asthmatic 
patients, as well as atopic dermatitis patients, 273 with anti-IL-5 
antibodies (mepolizumab) led to significant reductions in tissue 
eosinophilia, 271,274 despite no change in late-phase cutaneous 
allergic reactions. Most striking was a reduced thickness and 
density of the extracellular matrix (tenascin, lumican, and pro￾collagen III (COL3A)) following anti-IL-5 treatment, suggesting 

110 VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2 | MARCH 2009 | www.nature.com/mi
REVIEW
that IL-5-mediated tissue eosinophilia was indeed responsible 
for ECM deposition. However, despite these encouraging results, 
the precise role and involvement of eosinophils in human asthma 
is debated, with many clinical trials of anti-IL-5 mAb reporting 
little to no clinical improvement. 275,276
 Animal studies, using either IL-5-deficient mice 277 or eosi￾nophil-ablated mice 278,279 have supported a significant role for 
eosinophils, with reduced airway remodeling, including peri￾bronchial fibrosis and smooth muscle thickness, in addition to 
several other features of allergic asthma following chronic airway 
exposure. Similarly, blocking TGF 280 or interfering with TGF 
signaling 281 could also significantly attenuate airway remodeling 
following chronic allergen exposure. 
 Taken together, animal models have demonstrated a clear role 
for eosinophils and eosinophil-derived TGF  in airway dam￾age and remodeling. Human studies, however, have produced 
a spectrum of results and require additional studies, with well￾defined end points to address the role of IL-5 and eosinophils 
in the progression and resolution of subepithelial fibrosis in 
asthmatic airways. 
 IL-13 may also be a damaging cytokine in allergic individuals. 
Many of the pathological conditions identified in allergic asth￾matics can be traced to IL-13. For example, IL-13 can mediate 
goblet cell hyperplasia in local epithelia 282 and increase mucus 
production 92 that can block the small airways. 283,284 IL-13 can 
also promote epithelial repair, 285,286 fibroblast growth, 85,287
EMT, 288 and collagen deposition. 92 Beyond the airway epithe￾lium, IL-13 also causes smooth muscle hyperplasia 289 and sub￾epithelial fibrosis. 88 Similar to mechanisms proposed using the 
bleomycin model, IL-13 can synergize with and promote pro￾fibrotic TGF 290,291 eotaxin production, 40 and TIMP expres￾sion. 292 Thus, within the context of allergic asthma, eosinophils, 
TGF  , and IL-13 may all contribute to airway remodeling and 
pulmonary fibrosis. 
Less common pulmonary fibrotic conditions with known 
etiologies 
 Environmental particulates from smoking or occupational 
exposure can have toxic effects on the mucosal surfaces of the 
lung. For example, jobs that involve mining or that expose work￾ers to asbestos, metal dusts, or silica dust can cause pulmonary 
fibrosis. 293 Agricultural workers can also be affected, 293 with 
exposure to organic and inorganic substances, 294,295 fumes, 296 or 
moldy hay 297 causing allergic inflammation and fibrosis, often 
referred to as Farmer ’ s Lung. 298 – 300 Granulomatous lung dis￾ease and sarcoidosis is less common, with a global incidence of 
16.5 – 19 / 100,000. 301 These diseases are significantly influenced 
by genetic and environmental factors. To date, the causative 
agents have not been identified. 302 An alveolar macrophage 
gene-transcript profile 303 that is similar to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection has led to the hypothesis that bacteria 
may be involved. However, to date, bacteria have not been iso￾lated from sarcoidosis patients. Chronic inflammation and the 
development of inflammatory cell-rich pulmonary granulo￾mas, 304,305 rich in type-1 cytokines and chemokines 122,306 – 309
and T cells 310 can dramatically disrupt parenchymal architec￾ture, endothelial cells and the alveolar spaces of sarcoidosis 
patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of human and animal 
lung biopsies and post-mortem histological sections have iden￾tified elevated collagen and fibronectin in granulomas of sar￾coidosis patients. 305 Furthermore, co-expression of pro-fibrotic 
TGF  within the granulomas was also observed in sarcoidosis 
granulomas. 311 – 313 Despite these varying etiologies, recurring 
lung injury and inflammation 314 is common to many of these 
fibrotic conditions, and may broadly underlie the pathogenesis 
of pulmonary fibrosis. 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
 When all known causes of interstitial lung disease and fibro￾sis have been ruled out, the condition is referred to as “ idio￾pathic ” (of unknown origin) pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Despite 
an unknown etiology, there are a number of conditions and 
risk factors associated with the disease including; smoking, 315
farming, and occupational hazards 316,317 and viral, and bacte￾rial infections. 318 – 320 Furthermore, in one study, IPF patients 
had a greater propensity to develop primary lung cancer, 
compared with non-IPF patients with chronic lung disease or 
patients without lung disease. 321 Reports of familial aggregation 
of IPF also suggest that there may be a genetic component 
to IPF. 322,323 As mentioned above, the incidence of IPF in 
the United States is 30 / 100 000 4 and 34 000 new cases annu￾ally, 5 with a similar increasing incidence of IPF in the United 
Kingdom. 324
 IPF is characterized by usual interstitial pneumonitis 325 and 
progressive interstitial fibrosis caused by excessive extracellu￾lar matrix deposition. Regions of fibroblast and myofibroblast 
accumulation, specifically between the vascular endothelium 
and alveolar epithelium disrupt the architecture of the lung, 
giving a “ honeycomb ” appearance. 321 The pathogenesis of IPF 
has been debated for many years with two different schools 
of thought. One group suggests an inflammatory stimulus is 
involved, with recurring inflammation leading to immunopa￾thology, tissue destruction and the propagation of a wound￾healing response. 32,36,326,327 Others suggest a slightly different 
pathogenic mechanism in which an initial or absent inflamma￾tory stage is quickly followed by an uncontrolled wound-healing 
response. 30,328 Central to the argument negating the dominant 
role of inflammation is the inefficiency of corticosteroids and 
other anti-inflammatory agents to control IPF 34,35 despite 
some reports of enhanced survival. 329 Furthermore, the abil￾ity of epithelial cell-derived TGF 330,331 to invoke a fibrotic 
cascade with increased interstitial collagen and fibroblast 
proliferation in the absence of inflammation further support 
these views. We believe the controversy reflects our limited 
knowledge and insight into the causative agent(s) and patho￾genesis of IPF. A common, and accepted view is the early role 
of inflammatory events, initiating a wound-healing response. 
Whether the dysregulated wound-healing response continues 
in the absence of subsequent inflammation or not has yet to be 
clarified. Continuous chemokine and cytokine production 47 in 
diagnosed IPF patients indicates that damage and subsequent 
inflammation may be ongoing. 

MucosalImmunology | VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2 | MARCH 2009 111
REVIEW
 The cytokine profile from biopsy or BAL-derived cells 
or BAL fluid of IPF patients is rich in pro-inflammatory 
cytokines; IL-1  , 
332,333 IL-8, 122 IL-18, 334 TNF  , 
335 MCP￾1 122,336 as well as Type-2 cytokines, and their receptors. 337,338 The 
mixed cytokine profile, derived primarily from inflammatory 
cells 67 and leukocytes, 33,339 can have significant effects on all 
aspects of wound healing including vascular remodeling, myofi￾broblast differentiation, EMT, TGF  , and IL-13 production. In 
addition to the direct fibroblast-activating properties of TGF 
and IL-13, co-expression of these two cytokines in IPF has been 
observed. 93 Fibroblast hyperplasia 170 and the reduced expres￾sion of apoptotic mechanisms (bcl-2 and membrane FAS-L) 340
in IPF can further augment the fibrotic response. Collectively, 
a cascade of failed regulatory mechanisms and hyper-secretion 
of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, 47 culminates in 
an out-of-control fibroblast-mediated wound-healing response. 
Physiologically, IPF can dramatically compromise oxygen diffu￾sion, lung function 341 and is typically a fatal disease. 
REGULATION OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS 
 It is becoming clear that an imbalance of stimulatory cytokines, 
chemokines, and growth factors likely over-activate resident 
parenchymal and circulating cells and may underlie the over 
exuberant wound-healing responses that lead to fibrosis. In a 
normally controlled cellular response, negative feed back loops, 
anti-inflammatory molecules, inhibitory receptors, and apop￾totic pathways operate to fine tune and terminate responses once 
a desired outcome is achieved. Common to many pulmonary 
fibrotic conditions with both known and unknown etiologies 
may be a break down in these regulatory mechanisms, result￾ing in an excessive inflammatory cascade, neo-vascularization, 
uncontrolled fibroblast activation, and fibrosis. In this section 
of the review we will highlight some of these endogenous regu￾latory mechanisms that either operate endogenously or can be 
exploited therapeutically to counter balance the uncontrolled 
responses. 
Regulation of inflammatory responses: Tregs and IL-10 
 T cells with the primary function of attenuating immune 
cell activation and proliferation are frequently referred to as 
regulatory T cells (Treg). Although the specific details of antigen 
specificity, precise mechanisms of suppression, and distinguish￾ing features continue to grow, their role in fibrotic responses 
have been under studied. However, given their ability to dampen 
inflammatory responses, the ability of Tregs to interfere with 
upstream events and slow the progression of fibrosis has been 
implied. In particular Treg-derived IL-10, and other surface 
molecules 342 although not exclusively derived from Tregs, can 
function as a general immunosuppressant 343 and control fibro￾sis. 342 Polymorphisms in the signal sequence of the IL-10 gene 
have been identified in IPF patients, corresponding to reduced 
IL-10 production, suggesting that endogenous anti-inflamma￾tory mechanisms may be impaired in this condition. Supporting 
this notion, loss of function studies using LPS-induced lung 
injury and fibrosis in IL-10-deficient mice led to significantly 
stronger inflammatory responses with greater subepithelial 
thickening and extracelular matrix protein content. 344 In gain 
of function studies, induction of IL-10 significantly reduced 
collagen deposition following bleomycin administration in 
murine models. 345 Following IL-10 gene delivery BAL fluid 
TNF  and neutrophil-derived MPO levels were significantly 
reduced, with another similar study observing reduced macro￾phage-derived TGF  , 
43 suggesting that IL-10 inhibits inflamma￾tory cell recruitment. 345 Corroborating these findings, Dosanjh 
et al . 
346 reported higher levels of IL-8, with reduced IL-10 lev￾els in the BAL fluid of cystic fibrosis patients. Thus, IL-10 can 
attenuate the inflammatory events upstream of the fibrotic path￾way. In addition to suppressing inflammatory events, IL-10 can 
act directly on fibroblasts, reducing TGF  -induced collagen 
production. 345 Following lung injury in a rat model of radia￾tion-induced fibrosis, pneumocytes in the epithelial layer of 
the lung had reduced expression of IL-10, compared to control 
lungs, which may permit greater local inflammation. 222 Thus, 
IL-10 immunotherapy, with a sound understanding of timing 
and when to dampen inflammatory events may hold promise 
for pulmonary fibrotic conditions. 347 Beyond the lung, IL-10 
has been shown to regulate kidney 348 and liver 349 inflamma￾tion, and fibrosis. 350 Therapeutically manipulating IL-10, 
in particular endogenous IL-10-producing cells which may 
be present but in too low frequencies to significantly halt the 
inflammatory onslaught, may be a useful avenue to pursue. This 
has been demonstrated successfully in models of allergic airway 
inflammation, where a reduction in airway and tissue inflam￾mation, mucus production, and airway hyper-responsiveness 
was observed. 351
IL-13R 2 and LAP: endogenous attenuators of fibrosis 
 As discussed throughout this review, TGF  and 
IL-13 51,84,85,352,353 are dominant pro-fibrotic cytokines, acti￾vating fibroblasts, and promoting differentiation into  -SMA￾producing myofibroblasts and collagen production. Thus, tight 
regulation and fine-tuning of these two potent molecules is 
essential. Two molecules that can serve this very purpose are 
the IL-13R  2, an endogenous decoy receptor that attenuates 
IL-13 activity and, as discussed earlier, LAP, a latency-associ￾ated protein, which keeps TGF  in an inactive state. To our 
knowledge there are no studies to date reporting the specific 
induction of endogenous LAP to attenuate TGF  bioactivity; 
however, introduction of exogenous recombinant LAP could 
theoretically be used to attenuate TGF  activity 354 (similar to 
anti-TGF  antibody 280 ). Upregulation of a TGF  -binding pro￾tein, endoglin, however has been observed in animal models of 
renal fibrosis. 355 Exploiting this pathway to attenuate TGF  may 
be another option. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, 
the introduction of taurine and niacin into the diet of small 
rodents attenuates BLM-induced fibrosis, apparently by reduc￾ing TGF  production, 356 suggesting that dietary supplements 
may be useful therapeutics. Disrupting TGF  -associated ROS 357
or other downstream TGF  -signaling pathways 358 also hold 
promise. 
 IL-13R  2 is expressed predominantly by non-hematopoietic 
cells (unpublished observations) and attenuates IL-13 activity

in vivo . 
359 Given that IL-13 can act at multiple stages of the 
inflammatory and wound-healing response, 51,92,284,288,358,360
it comes as little surprise that attenuation of IL-13 can have 
profound effects on the degree of pulmonary inflammation 
and fibrosis in many pulmonary disease models. 88,90,361 Several 
methods of IL-13 attenuation have been described, including 
neutralizing Abs, 87 treatment with sIL-13R  2, 359,362 – 364 or tar￾geting the IL-13R  2-expressing cells. The conclusions from all 
of these studies indicate that targeting the IL-13 pathway holds 
great promise for the treatment of fibrosis. 
Resetting the imbalance 
 An imbalance of cytokines, chemokines or cells can disrupt 
many downstream processes ( Figure 2 ). For example, an imbal￾ance between collagen-catabolizing MMPs and their specific 
inhibitors, TIMPs, can result in excessive collagen breakdown. 
However, they can also promote TGF  activation in peripheral 
cells. 365 – 367 Increased TGF  can further feed back to induce 
more MMPs 368 and promote EMT. 368 Thus, a breakdown in 
one process (MMP production) can quickly catalyze and 
disrupt other regulatory mechanisms (TGF  responses). Within 
mammalian systems, a refined balance between “ on ” and “ off ” 
signals is critical to maintain homeostasis. In a dysregulated 
wound-healing response several key mechanisms appear to be 
off balance ( Figure 2 ). 
 (1) Inflammation “ vs. ” Immunosuppression . Excessive or 
recurring inflammatory events can cause excessive wound-heal￾ing responses that lead to the development of fibrosis. Either 
eliminating the causative agent, such as allergen avoidance, or 
treatments with anti-inflammatory agents such as corticoster￾oids may help restore the balance. 
 (2) MMP “ vs. ” TIMP . MMPs can disrupt the basement 
membrane and allow the influx of inflammatory cells. Inhibiting 
MMP activity could be detrimental in immunity and in the proc￾ess of re-epithelialization; 369 however, in pathological fibrotic 
responses, neutralization of specific MMPs either with small 
molecules, 157 inhibitors 157 or by influencing TIMP expression 
may help restore this imbalance. 
 (3) Fibroblast apoptosis “ vs. ” proliferation . The late-stage 
apoptosis of fibroblasts is required for successful wound healing 
Figure 2 Imbalanced wound-healing response. For successful wound healing, a regulated response is maintained through negative feedback loops 
and a balance of catabolising and regenerative processes. Several imbalances may develop and lead a normal healing response into a fibrotic 
cascade. Excessive inflammation and the production of inflammatory and fibroblast-activating cytokines, through a breakdown in anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms can develop. Over-production of angiogenic CXC ELR + chemokines, the recruitment of fibrocytes and increased frequency of -SMA + 
cells in the injury site can result in too much collagen deposition. Resetting the balance with targeted therapeutics (i.e., cytokine-blocking antibodies) 
may help slow the progression of fibrosis.

and termination of collagen deposition. As mentioned above, 
resistance to apoptosis has been observed in fibroblasts from 
IPF patients. 165 – 167 Restoring fibroblast apoptotic pathways or 
selectively depleting fibroblasts at the appropriate time may help 
slow the progression of fibrosis. Modulating local cytokine and 
growth factor levels could also influence fibroblast proliferation 
and activation indirectly. 
 (4) ELR + “ vs. ” ELR − CXC chemokines . The prolonged induc￾tion ELR + chemokines, due to inflammatory signals can lead to 
excessive vascularization. Anti-angiogenic therapy, 370 an area 
actively pursued in cancer therapy was recently investigated in 
fibrotic conditions. 371 Inhibiting VEGF or promoting endosta￾tin and anastellin (endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis) may 
limit inflammation and the recruitment of myofibroblasts. 
Neutralizing angiogenic ELR + CXC chemokines or enhanc￾ing angiostatic ELR − CXC chemokines, 372 – 374 in combination 
with other therapeutic interventions, may also dramatically 
halt the inflammatory cascade and avoid the requirements for 
angiogenesis. 
CONCLUSION 
 Pulmonary wound repair is an extremely dynamic process 
intersecting immunology, structural biology, and airway 
physiology. For successful repair a collaborative effort between 
these systems is essential. Dysregulation in one response 
can have ripple effects on others and progressively turn a 
well-choreographed healing response into a fibrotic lesion. 
Vascular damage must be quickly repaired with a fibrin-rich 
clot. This is followed by an influx of inflammatory cells. Chronic 
or recurring inflammation requires rapid resolution to avert 
immunopathology while providing the necessary cellular 
participants. Parenchymal cells that are responsive to inflam￾matory cues must proliferate and migrate into the damaged 
area, restore tissue architecture, with the inflammatory cells 
ultimately undergoing apoptosis to prevent excessive collagen 
deposition. 
 In pulmonary fibrotic disease states, the development 
and progression of the healing response has slipped out of 
control, disrupting many delicate balances. As discussed in this 
review, there are a number of compensatory and redundant 
processes, which all contribute to proficient healing and remod￾eling. With this in mind, and despite significant advances in 
our understanding of these pathways and balances, there 
is a lack of therapeutic intervention and new therapies for 
pulmonary fibrosis. Further studies are required to elucidate 
the roles of the many mediators (cytokines, chemokines and 
growth factors) observed in both human and animal models 
of pulmonary fibrosis. Greater still, pre-clinical and clinical 
investigations with chemokine receptor antagonists, angiogen￾esis inhibitors and Abs to the pro-fibrotic molecules IL-13 and 
TGF  are required. A combined effort by clinicians and lab 
researchers across platforms and disciplines could make this a 
climbable mountain.
