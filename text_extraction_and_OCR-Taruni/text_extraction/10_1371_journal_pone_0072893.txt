Abstract
Background: Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic modality for patients with acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF).
These patients are at high risk for bacterial infections while awaiting transplantation. The aim of this study was to elucidate
whether an adequately treated bacterial infection influences the outcomes after transplantation in this patient population.
Methodology/Principal Findings: 54 recipients (median age, 49.5 years [range, 22–60]) of adult-to-adult living donor liver
transplant (LDLT) for ACLF were categorized as those with pretransplant infection (Group 1, n = 34) or without pretransplant
infection (Group 2, n = 20) for retrospective analyses. With the exception of a higher male-female ratio (P = 0.046) and longer
length of pretransplant hospital stay (P = 0.026) in Group 1, similar demographic, laboratory and clinical features were found
in both groups. Patients in Group 1 (totally 42 pretransplant infection episodes) were adequately treated with effective
antibiotic(s) before receiving LDLT. All included patients were followed up until one year after transplantation or death.
Sixty-one posttransplant infection episodes were found in an overall of 44 ACLF patients (27 in Group 1 vs. 15 in Group 2;
P = 0.352). Frequently encountered posttransplant infections were intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, bloodstream
infection and urinary tract infection. Two patients died in each group (P = 0.622). No significant difference was found in the
length of posttransplant ICU stay, and in one-year survival, graft rejection, and posttransplant infection rate between both
groups. The longer overall hospital stay (mean day, 89.0 vs. 65.5, P = 0.024) found in Group 1 resulted from a longer
pretransplant hospital stay receiving treatment for pretransplant infection(s) and/or awaiting transplantation.
Conclusions: These data suggested that an adequately treated pretransplant infection do not pose a significant risk for
clinical outcomes including posttransplant fatality in recipients in adult-to-adult LDLT for ACLF.

Introduction
Liver transplantation is the only curative modality for patients
with relentless liver failure resulting from chronic hepatic
decompensation or acute exacerbation of chronic liver disease.
Among liver transplant recipients, a substantial number of patients
have been of cases of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) [1].
The prognosis is dismal when such patients develop multiorgan
failure. Of note, ACLF patients receiving supportive treatment
while awaiting liver transplant are at high risk for bacterial
infections [1,2], and data regarding whether an adequately treated
bacterial infection influences the outcomes after transplantation in
this patient population are scarce. The aim of this study was to
elucidate the impact of pretransplant infection in patients with
ACLF on the outcomes after liver transplantation in general, and
posttransplant infections and mortality in particular.
Patients and Methods
Hospital Setting
We retrospectively reviewed ACLF patients who underwent
adult-to-adult living donor liver transplant (LDLT) at Kaohsiung
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 2001 and
December 2009. This study was conducted with a waiver of
patient consent approved the Institutional Review Board of Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital (Document no. 101–0564B).

Definitions
ACLF was defined as an acute hepatic insult manifesting as
jaundice (serum bilirubin .5 mg/dl) and coagulopathy (interna￾tional normalized ratio .1.5) complicated within 4 weeks by
ascites and/or encephalopathy in a patient with previously
diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease [3]. All patients
were followed up until one year after liver transplant or death.
Ascites was detected by sonography and/or findings at laparot￾omy. Hepatic encephalopathy was clinically diagnosed based on
neurologic findings, and its severity was stratified according to the
West Haven Criteria [4]. The included ACLF patients were
categorized as those with a pretransplant infection or those
without a pretransplant infection. Preoperative management of
these patients included supportive care for liver failure, and
antiviral treatment for viral hepatitis, antibiotic therapy for
bacterial infection(s), and/or mechanical ventilatory support for
respiratory failure as necessary.
A pretransplant infection referred to an infection occurred
within 4 weeks prior to liver transplantation, which was diagnosed
based on clinical and laboratory (e.g., blood, ascites, sputum, and
urine) and/or imaging (e.g., chest X-ray, ultrasonography, and
CT) findings. Pretransplant infections were categorized into
bloodstream infection (BSI), pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis (SBP), and urinary tract infection (UTI). Sepsis was
defined as an infection with the presence of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome in the affected patient, which was manifested
by two or more of the following conditions: (i) temperature .38uC
or ,36uC, (ii) heart rate .90 beats/min, (iii) respiratory rate .20
breaths/min or PaCO2 ,32 mmHg, and (iv) peripheral white cell
count (WBC). 12,000/ mm3
, ,4000/ mm3
, or consisting
of.10% immature (band-form) cell [5]. BSI was defined as an
infection with pathogen(s) isolated from blood culture. A microbe
of normal commensals (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci and
Gram-positive bacilli) was regarded as a significant pathogen for
BSI if (i) it grew from $2 blood specimens sampled from different

sites at different time points, or (ii) it grew from only one blood
specimen of a clinically septic patient with a predisposing factor
(e.g., central catheterization and/or indwelling foreign device) for
infection due to this pathogen [6], and his or her sepsis improved
after receiving antibiotic therapy accordingly, with or without
removal of a related catheter and/or device. BSI referred to a
significant bacteremia in a patient from whom no apparent
infection focus was found; otherwise, the bacteremia was regarded
as one secondary to the infection focus. Pneumonia was defined as
the emergence of a new infiltrate or presence of a progressive
infiltrate on chest radiography of a septic patient with fever,
leukocytosis, purulent sputum or increased respiratory secretions,
emerging or worsening cough, dyspnea, tachycardia, rales
detected at auscultation and/or arterial oxygen desaturation
[6,7]. UTI was defined as the presence of dysuria, frequency
and/or urgency with or without flank knocking pain in a septic
patient with pyuria. SBP was defined as the presence of a
peritoneal sign such as muscle guarding and/or rebound
tenderness over the distended abdomen of a patient with a
polymorphonuclear neutrophil count $250 cells/mm3 in his or
her ascites, regardless bacterial growth from culture [8]. Bacterial
isolates were identified by conventional methods and/or the
automated ID 32GN system (Vitek Systems, bioMe´rieux, Hazel￾wood, MO). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on a
daily-service basis using Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion methods [9]
and interpretive criteria for susceptibility recommended by CLSI
(formerly NCCLS) [10].
Medical Management
All patients with a diagnosed bacterial infection were given
antibiotic(s) on empirical basis, which was then adjusted based on
recommendations made by an infectious-disease specialist if the
infection clinically deteriorated, or was subsequently switched to
other antimicrobial(s) as was indicated by the results of culture and
susceptibility testing. A pretransplant bacterial infection was
considered adequately treated and the affected patient was
regarded as an eligible transplant recipient only when he or she
fulfilled the criteria as follows: (i) disappearance of symptoms and
signs suggestive of sepsis, and (ii) normalization or improvement of
laboratory and/or imaging findings indicating bacterial infection.
Liver Transplantation and Postoperative Care
Hepatectomy in donors and recipients and liver engrafting for
recipients in LDLT were performed as described previously [11–
13]. The majority of liver grafts were harvested from the right
lobe, with or without outflow reconstruction for connecting the
branches of the middle hepatic vein. All patients received
immunosuppressants that include tacrolimus, low-dose steroid,
and mycophenolate mofetil as standard immunosuppressant
regimen. The dosing of these immunosuppressants was adjusted
based on the function of the liver graft. As for prophylaxis for
postoperation bacterial and Candida infections, combination of
either cefepime or ceftazidime (20 mg/kg/8 hours) and teicopla￾nin (400 mg/day) was started immediately before operation and
lasted for 3–5 days depending upon posttransplant conditions, and
fluconazole 100mg/ day was started after transplantation and was
used during post-operation stay at ICU. Daily trimethoprim
80mg/sulfamethoxazole 400 mg was started after operation and
was used indefinitely as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci.
Ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/12 hours) was used when cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection was clinically suspected or upon detection of
CMV antigenemia.
All recipients were admitted to Liver Intensive Care Unit
(LICU) for postoperative care, where laboratory data (mainly
hemogram and blood chemistry) were closely monitored. Doppler
ultrasound was performed daily to check the vascular flow in the
graft for one week after liver transplant and then twice weekly until
the patient was discharged. These patients were additionally
evaluated by a dedicated infectious-disease specialist (Dr. JW Liu)
on daily basis. Once bacterial infection was suspected, empirical
antibiotic therapy immediately started.
Statistical Analyses
Data of the included ACLF patients were retrieved from their
medical records. Between different patient groups, comparison of
categorical variables was carried out using the x2 test or Fisher
exact test when appropriate, and comparison of continuous
variables was performed using t-test or Mann-Whitney U test,
where applicable. To ascertain the impact of pretransplant
infection on the postoperative mortality by eliminating potential
confounding(s), pretransplant infection and other variables be￾tween fatal and survived liver transplant recipients were entered
into a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model. A P
value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical

analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Demographic, Clinical and Laboratory Features of ACLF
Patients
Among a total of 408 patients received adult-to-adult LDLT
during the study period, 54 (36 men and 18 women [median
age = 49.5 years, range = 22–60 years]) were found to be of ACLF
cases and were included for analyses. None of these patients was
put on an artificial liver support system (ALSS) prior to liver
transplant. The included ACLF patients were categorized as those
with pretransplant infection (Group 1, n = 34) or those without
pretransplant infection (Group 2, n = 20). With the exception of a
higher male-female ratio (26:8 vs. 10:10, P = 0.046) and longer
length of pretransplant hospital stay (mean, 28.0 vs. 14.5 days;
P = 0.026) in Group 1 than in Group 2, similar demographic,
laboratory and clinical features were found in both groups, and
hepatitis B was the most commonly encountered liver disease
among the overall included ACLF patients (Table 1). The median
of MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score was 24 for both
Group 1 and Group 2 [14]. No significant difference was found in
the lengths of pretransplant hospital stay (31.9623.8 vs.
21.5620.6 days; P = 0.149) and overall hospital stay
(85.9630.4 vs. 74.82627.2 days; P = 0.948) between patients with
MELD scores"25 and those with MELD scores ,24 among the
overall included patients.
Pretransplant Infections
A total of 42 pretransplant infection episodes were found in the
34 LDLT recipients. Among these patients, 26 (76.5%) experi￾enced one episode of pretransplant infection, while the rest 8 each
experienced 2. Major pretransplant infection entities in decreasing
order were UTI (n = 14), SBP (n = 11), pneumonia (n = 7) and BSI
(n = 6); pretransplant infection entities and the pathogens are
summarized in Table 2. The most frequently found pathogens
were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7). All patients with pretransplant
infection received effective antibiotic therapy, and extracorporeal
shock-wave lithotomy was additionally carried out for one patient
with urolithiasis suffering urinary tract infection. The mean time
lapse from starting an antimicrobial treatment for pretransplant
infection to LDLT was 13.8612.6 days.
Outcomes after Liver Transplantation
With the exception of a longer total hospital stay (89.0 days
[range, 30–163] vs. 65.5 days [44–117], P = 0.024) in Group 1
than in Group 2, no significant difference was found in the length
of posttransplant ICU stay, and in one-year survival, graft
rejection, and posttransplant infection rates between both groups
(Table 3). Two fatal cases were found in each group, accounting
for a fatality rate of 6.0% in Group 1 and of 10.0% in Group 2,
respectively (P = 0.622). In Group 1, one patient experienced
posttransplant hepatic arterial thrombosis and died of intractable
internal bleeding with hypovolumic shock and intraabdominal
Candida infection 5 days after retransplantation, while the other
died of progressive multiorgan failure one day after LDLT. In
Group 2, one patient who experienced biliary leak after LDLT
died of biliary tract infection with sepsis 3 months later, while the
other who experienced posttransplant graft failure with persistent
coagulopathy and internal bleeding died of hepatic failure,
pneumonia and bacterial peritonitis with sepsis one month after
liver transplantation. Multivariate analysis disclosed that none of
the evaluated variables including the length of posttransplant
hospital stay, graft rejection, posttransplant infection, and pre￾transplant infection significantly differed (P.0.050) between fatal
and survived liver transplant recipients.
Detailed Posttransplant Infections
A total of 61 posttransplant infection episodes were found in an
overall of 44 ACLF patients (28 [82.4%] in Group 1 vs. 16 [80%]

in Group 2; P = 0.352); these infection episodes and pathogens
were detailed in Table 4. Bacterial peritonitis was the most
frequently encountered posttransplant infection of which Acineto￾bacter species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the
leading pathogens. Intraabdominal infection was the most
commonly found posttransplant infection regardless of pretrans￾plant infection. Posttransplant infections developed in patients
with pretransplant infection were summarized in Table 5, which in
decreasing order were intraabdominal infection, pneumonia,
primary BSI and UTI. Of note, one patient suffered pre- and
post-liver transplant peritonitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
while another experienced pretransplant primary K. pneumoniae
bacteremia and posttransplant peritonitis with a K. pneumoniae
being isolated from ascites culture. Molecular differentiation was
not performed to clarify whether these P. aeruginosa and K.
pneumoniae isolates were of the same clone.
Discussion
A total of the 49 pretransplant infection episodes developed in
34 (68%) of the overall 54 ACLF patients included in this series,
and the most common pretransplant infection was UTI, as
opposed to SBP that was reported to be the most frequently
encountered pretransplant infection in patients with chronic liver
failure [15]. ACLF features acute liver injury on top of chronic
liver damage, and ACLF patients are subject to high chances of
bacterial infection while awaiting liver transplantation. Among
patients with chronic liver failure, the impacts of pretransplant
infections on post-liver-transplant morbidity and mortality had
been controversial before a recently published research by Sun et
al. suggesting that an adequately treated pretransplant infection
did not pose a significant risk for poor outcomes including
posttransplant fatality [8].
In the circumstances of shortage of organ donated by a deceased
donor, liver graft donated by a living adult shortens the waiting
time for patients for whom urgent liver transplant is indicated [16].
Our report is the first series specifically addressed the impacts of
pretransplant infection on posttransplant outcomes in ACLF
patients who received LDLT, and the results suggest that ACLF
patients with sufficiently treated pretransplant infection are not at
higher risk of posttransplant mortality and morbidity. The longer
length of overall hospital stay (mean, 89 vs. 65.5 days; P = 0.024)
and similar lengths of posttransplant ICU and posttransplant
hospital stay between patients with pretransplant infection and
those without merely suggested that the former had a longer
pretransplant hospital stay receiving treatment for their pretrans￾plant infection and/or awaiting transplantation. Our data
disclosed that in ACLF patients with an adequately treated
pretransplant bacterial infection, irrespective of the anatomic site
involved, frequently encountered posttransplant infections were
intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, BTI and UTI, which were
similar to those reported in other liver transplant series that
included patients with chronic liver failure [2,8,17–19].
In case a liver graft not being available in a timely fashion, a
plasma-exchange-centered ALSS was reported to be helpful in
bridging ACLF to liver transplantation [20]. While it may
downgrade the MELD score before liver transplantation, the
ALSS is far from a salvage modality for ACLF [20]. Of note,
ACLF patients being put on an ALSS are at high risk for bacterial
infections as well [20], and the impact of a pretransplant infection
on the post-liver-transplant outcomes in this patient population
needs to be clarified by further studies.
ACLF per se compromises the immunity of the affected patients
[21], and a major surgical operation and subsequently used

immunosuppressants add to vulnerability to infections [19]. The
risk for infection in liver transplant recipients depends on both
microbial exposure and the immune-suppressed intensity, which
are often referred to as the ‘‘net state of immunosuppression’’ [22].
Recipients are always subject to high chances of bacterial
infections within months after liver transplantation [18,19].
Of note, frequently seen pathogens for hospital-acquired
infections such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [23], were found to be responsible only
for posttransplant infections in our series. A. baumannii, a usually
multidrug-resistant pathogen [24], has been unfortunately un￾commonly found in posttransplant infections [25–27]. In agree￾ment with other transplant series [28–31], a substantial number of
Gram-positive microbes normally considered cutaneous flora were
found to be pathogens in ours, and this is not surprising in view
that all of the immediate posttransplant recipients were indwelling
central-venous catheter and/or other draining catheter/tube of
which the exit potentially served as a portal of entry for bacteria
normally inhabit in skin.
Bacterial infections in general and bacteremia in particular have
been reported to be the major causes of posttransplant mortality
[19,32–34]. Our data highlight the importance of a timely
alertness to a posttransplant infection and an immediate effective
empirical antimicrobial coverage for potential pathogens in ACLF
patients. Remarkably, impaired inflammatory response resulting
from compromised immunity may clinically attenuate the
otherwise marked signs/symptoms of invasive infections in liver
transplant recipients [19–22], and these patients should therefore
be closely monitored and evaluated by experienced clinicians after
liver transplantation, preferably by a dedicated infectious-disease
specialist.
Limitations of this study include potential biases inherent to the
retrospective study and small sample size. Nevertheless, our data
suggested that an adequately treated pretransplant infection do not
pose a significant risk for clinical outcomes including posttrans￾plant fatality in recipients in adult-to-adult LDLT for ACLF.
