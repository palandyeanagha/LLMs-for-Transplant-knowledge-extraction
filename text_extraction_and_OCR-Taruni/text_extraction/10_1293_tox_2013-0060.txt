Abstract: The primary function of the placenta is to act as an interface between the dam and fetus. The anatomic structure of the 
chorioallantoic placenta in eutherian mammals varies between different animal species. The placental types in eutherian mammals 
are classified from various standpoints based on the gross shape, the histological structure of the materno-fetal interface, the type of 
materno-fetal interdigitation, etc. Particularly, the histological structure is generally considered one of the most useful and instructive 
classifications for functionally describing placental type. In this system, three main types are recognized according to the cell layers 
comprising the interhemal area: (1) epitheliochorial type (horses, pigs and ruminants), (2) endotheliochorial type (carnivores) and (3) 
hemochorial type (primates, rodents and rabbits). The number of cell layers in the interhemal area is considered to modify the transfer 
of nutrients between maternal and fetal blood and is one of the important factors with respect to the difference in placental permeability 
between animal species. Therefore, in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, careful attention should be paid to the histologi￾cal structure of the interhemal area when extrapolating information concerning placental transfer characteristics to different animal 
species. (DOI: 10.1293/tox.2013-0060; J Toxicol Pathol 2014; 27: 11–18)

Introduction
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in 
rats and rabbits are necessary for safety evaluation of phar￾maceutical drugs, pesticides and food additives. The pla￾centa is one of the important organs for the evaluation of 
risks for dams and embryos/fetuses in these toxicity studies. 
The placenta grows rapidly, and exhibits marked changes 
in morphological structure according to fetal development. 
Although the placenta is a temporary organ, it is the inter￾face between the dam and developing embryos/fetuses, and 
a multifaceted organ that performs a number of important 
functions throughout gestation. These functions include an￾choring the developing fetus to the uterine wall, mediating 
maternal immune tolerance, O2
/CO2
 exchange, providing 
nutrients for the fetus and removing waste products during 
embryonic development1
. It also protects the embryo/fetus 
as a barrier against xenobiotics and releases a variety of ste￾roids, hormones and cytokines. However, there is a diversity 
of placental morphologies in different animal species2
. The 
placental types in eutherian mammals are classified from 
various standpoints based on the gross shape, the histologi￾cal structure of the materno-fetal interface, the type of ma￾terno-fetal interdigitation, etc.3–8. It is important to consider 
the diversity of placental morphologies when extrapolating 
physiological, endocrinological, immunological, or any oth￾er data from the animal to the human situation in discussion 
of the passage of drugs and chemicals from dams to fetuses5
. 
In addition, the histopathological approaches to the patho￾genesis of placental toxicity are considered to provide an 
important tool for understanding the mechanism of repro￾ductive and developmental toxicity with particular regard 
to embryo lethality and delayed development9
. Therefore, it 
is the purpose of this paper to describe the morphological 
placental classifications and the comparison of histological 
placental structure in experimental animals.
Placental Classifications
Mammalian placentas are classified into two types ac￾cording to the fetal membrane including to chorion, yolk 
sac placenta (choriovitelline placenta) and chorioallantoic 
placenta. The yolk sac placenta is the vascularized trilami￾nar yolk sac apposed to uterine tissue, and usually plays a 
role as a transient placenta during the early postimplantation 
period before the allantoic circulation is established10, 11. In

12 Comparison of Placental Structure in Experimental Animals
most mammals, the yolk sac placenta becomes vestigial af￾ter the first trimester, except in rodents and rabbits. The cho￾rioallantoic placenta is formed from the endometrium of the 
dam and the trophectoderm of the embryo and is the prin￾cipal placenta in mammals during middle to late-gestation. 
It shows a variety of shapes between different animal spe￾cies based on the morphology3–8. Two main classifications 
of chorioallantoic placentas are described as below.
Classification based on gross shape
Four main types are recognized according to the gross 
morphology of the placenta (Fig. 1). The basis of the clas￾sification is whether materno-fetal exchange area is found 
over all the available surface of the chorionic sac or whether 
it is restricted. This classification provides a useful simpli￾fication, but within orders, there are invariably exceptions 
outside the usual category4
.
(1) Diffuse: this type of placenta occurs over the entire 
surface of the uterine luminal epithelium with formation of 
folds/villi and is found in horses and pigs.
(2) Multicotyledonary: this type of placenta is char￾acterized by many spot-like placental regions of the endo￾metrium known as caruncles (from 100 to 120 caruncles 
in sheep and 4 caruncles in deer). Intervening areas of the 
chorion are smooth and relatively avascular. This type of 
placenta is found in ruminants.
(3) Zonary: this type of placenta shows an intimate in￾terdigitating contact zone that forms a belt around the chori￾onic sac. This type of placenta is found in carnivores.
(4) Discoid/bidiscoid: this type of placenta is charac￾terized by a single (discoid) or double disc (bidiscoid), and 
interaction is confined to a roughly circular area. This type 
of placenta is found in primates, rodents and rabbits.
Classification based on histological structure
Three main types are recognized according to the his￾tologic relationship established between the chorion and 
uterine wall6, 12, 13 (Fig. 2). It is generally considered one 
of the most useful and instructive methods for functionally 
describing placental type and was proposed by Grosser14.
(1) Epitheliochorial type: this type is the most super￾ficial placenta and lacks significant invasion of the uterine 
lining. Pockets of columnar trophoblasts are loosely applied 
to the maternal endometrial epithelium. No destruction or 
invasion of the maternal tissues occurs and no layers are 
removed. The epitheliochorial type is found in horses, pigs 
and ruminants. Although there is some controversy over the 
evolution of the placenta, it is considered that the common 
ancestor of living placental mammals had a moderately in￾vasive placenta of the endotheliochorial type12. The syndes￾mochorial type is a placenta from which the endometrial 
epithelium is removed after implantation and was added to 
the placental classification list for a while14. However, elec￾tron microscopic examination eliminated this type from the 
classification because it is never found in the interhemal re￾gions15. On the other hand, some reports have described that 
the syndesmochorial placenta is an unusual type of placenta 
for ruminants: some specific trophoblasts (the binucleate 
cells) fuse with a single uterine epithelial cell, giving rise to 
trinucleate cells or even multinucleate structures of mixed 
fetal and maternal origin16.
(2) Endotheliochorial type: the maternal uterine epithe￾lium and connective tissue disappear after implantation, and

the trophoblasts come into direct contact with the maternal 
endometrial. The endotheliochorial type occurs in orders 
from all four major clades of eutherian mammals (Euar￾chontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Xenarthra and Afrotheria), 
including carnivores17.
(3) Hemochorial type: this type is the most invasive 
placenta. All maternal tissue layers disappear through ero￾sion, leading to direct connection between the chorion and 
maternal blood. There are hemomonochorial (primates), 
hemodichorial (rabbits), and hemotrichorial (rats and mice) 
placentas, with one, two and three trophoblast layers, re￾spectively15, 18.
Anatomical Features of Placentas in Experimen￾tal Animals3–5, 7, 12, 15, 19–21
Pig (minipig)
Pigs have an epitheliochorial and diffuse type of pla￾centa (Fig. 3a). Histologically, the surface of the allantocho￾rion becomes complexly folded, producing ridges that fit 
into corresponding grooves or crypts in the endometrium 
(Fig. 3b). In the interhemal area, the maternal vessels and fe￾tal vessels are situated just below the basement membranes 
of the endometrium and trophectoderm without the destruc￾tion of endometrial tissue22, 23 (Fig. 3c). However, the endo￾metrium and trophectoderm are thin and deeply indented 
by the blood vessels as pregnancy proceeds, resulting in 
shorter diffusion distances across the epitheliochorial pla￾centa2
. The interhemal distance can be as little as 2 μm24. 
The depths between the chorionic folds, the so-called areo￾lus, are lined by tall, columnar trophoblasts (areolar troph￾ectoderm) that are actively phagocytic (Fig. 3d). Uterofer￾rin, an iron-containing glycoprotein, is released from the 
endometrial glands to the lumen, taken up by the areolar 
trophectoderm, and then transferred to the fetus, as an iron 
source25. Many endometrial glands are observed under the 
endometrium (Fig. 3e).
Dog
Dogs have an endotheliochorial and zonary type of 
placenta26 (Fig. 4a). Histologically, the placenta of dogs is 
composed of the labyrinth zone, the junctional zone and the 
glandular zone (Fig. 4b). The labyrinth zone is composed 
of trophoblastic lamellae, in which cytotrophoblasts and 
syncytiotrophoblasts cover the maternal vessels (Fig. 4c). 
The maternal vessels are surrounded by a noncellular layer,

which is positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and 
Alcian blue stain. The fetal vessels deeply indent the tropho￾blasts. The junctional zone is an area of transition between 
the labyrinth zone and gland zone (Fig. 4d). The tropho￾blasts, which show tall columnar cells in monolayers with 
microvilli on the free surface, invade into the endometrial 
gland cavity. Particularly, the deep part of the junctional 
zone is called the sponge zone (Fig. 4e). The glandular zone 
is composed of the remnants of endometrial glands. These 
glands become distended by retained secreted function 
as the result of obstruction of their mouths by penetrating 
trophoblasts (Fig. 4b). Marginal hemophagous zones filled 
with maternal blood develop at both edges of the placenta or 
in the middle of the placenta22 (Fig. 4f). They are lined by 
high columnar trophectoderm showing active phagocytosis 
and digestion of erythrocytes, and are considered to have a 
relationship with placental iron transport27.
Rat and mouse
Rats and mice have a hemotrichorial and discoid type 
of placenta9, 28 (Fig. 5a). Histologically, the placenta of 
rats and mice is composed of the labyrinth zone, the basal 
zone, the decidua and the metrial glands29–32 (Fig. 5b). In 
the labyrinth zone, there are three layers of trophoblasts, 
separating the maternal blood spaces from the fetal blood 
vessels2, 18 (Fig. 5c). The outer trophectoderm, which comes 
into direct contact with the maternal blood, is referred to 
as cytotrophoblasts with a microvillous surface. Under this 
trophectoderm, there are two layers of syncytiotrophoblasts. 
The basal zone is comprised of three types of differentiated 
cells: (1) spongiotrophoblasts, (2) trophoblastic giant cells 
and (3) glycogen cells (Fig. 5d). The spongiotrophoblasts 
are present immediately above the trophoblastic giant cell 
layer located at the materno-fetal placental interface. The 
glycogen cells form multiple small cell masses and develop 
into glycogen cell islands in midgestation, and then most 
of them disappear before parturition. The decidua is com￾prised of the mesometrial decidual cells ultimately, and 
plays essential roles in the development of the vascularized 
decidual-placental interface. The metrial gland is located in 
the mesometrial triangle of the pregnant uterus from early 
gestation and is fully developed in midgestation, leading 
to regression before parturition30, 33. It is composed of de￾cidualized endometrial stromal cells, uterine natural killer 
cells, spinal-shaped arteries, trophoblasts originating from 
glycogen cells, and fibroblasts34, 35 (Fig. 5e). The yolk sac is 
composed of epithelial cells and mesodermal cells (Fig. 5f) 
and is divided into visceral and parietal parts. Because the 
parietal yolk sac ruptures in midgestation, the inside of the 
visceral yolk sac becomes exposed to the intrauterine cavity

and is called a reversed yolk sac placenta, which functions 
throughout pregnancy.
Rabbit
Rabbits have a hemodichorial and bidiscoid type of 
placenta22, 28, 36 (Fig. 6a). Histologically, the placenta of rab￾bits is composed of the labyrinth zone, the junctional zone, 
the decidua·zone of necrosis, the decidua·zone of separation, 
and the mesometrium37, 38 (Fig. 6b). In the labyrinth zone, 
there are two layers of trophoblasts, an outer and inner layer 
separating the maternal blood spaces from the fetal blood 
vessels2, 22, 39 (Fig. 6c). The outer trophectoderm, which 
comes into direct contact with the maternal blood, is com￾prised of the syncytiotrophoblasts, which are joined to the 
underlying cytotrophoblast layer by adhesion junctions. The 
inner trophectoderm is one layer of cytotrophoblasts over￾lying fetal blood vessels. The junctional zone is composed 
of glycogen cells containing PAS-positive substances (Fig. 
6d). These cells are transiently detected in midgestation, 
and disappear before parturition. The decidua originates 
from stromal cells of the mesometrial endometrium and is 
divided into the zone of necrosis and the zone of separation 
in midgestation. The zone of necrosis develops with dilated 
blood vessels as pregnancy advances. This zone is detected 
under the junctional zone and is composed of necrotic tis￾sue. The zone of separation becomes thinner without necro￾sis as pregnancy advances (Fig. 6e). The structure and func￾tions of the yolk sac placenta are the same as those of rats 
and mice (Fig. 6f).
Cynomolgus monkey
Cynomolgus monkeys have a hemomonochorial and 
bidiscoid type of placenta28 (Fig. 7a). Histologically, the pla￾centa of cynomolgus monkeys is composed of the placental 
villi, the chorionic plate, the basal plate and the decidua31, 40
(Fig. 7b). The placental villi protrude into the intervillous 
space and are bathed directly in maternal blood. The an￾choring villi are peripheral ones that are connected to the 
basal zone. The placental villous surface is composed of an 
outer continuous layer of syncytiotrophoblasts in contact 
with maternal blood and an inner discontinuous layer of cy￾totrophoblasts2, 41 (Fig. 7c). The stroma of the placental villi 
is composed of fetal vessels and mesenchyme. The chorionic 
plate is populated with mesenchymal cells within a fibrous 
connective tissue, and represents the cover of the intervil￾lous space. Tree-like arranged placental villi arise from the 
chorionic plate (Fig. 7d). The basal plate is the bottom of 
the intervillous space and the junction of the endometrium

with fetal tissues (Fig. 7e). The basal plate is composed of 
extravillous cytotrophoblasts, endometrial stromal cells, de￾cidual cells, etc. The placenta of cynomolgus monkeys is 
very similar to the human placenta2
.
Placental Permeability Between Different Ani￾mal Species
The fully formed placenta plays a major role in main￾tenance of nutrition for the fetus and in the secretory and 
essential regulatory functions for maintenance of pregnancy 
during the fetal period. As described in this brief review 
of the anatomical placentas in some experimental animals, 
the composition of intervening cells in the interhemal ar￾eas is different between animal species. Molecules cross 
the placenta either by diffusion or some form of active or 
facilitated transport. In the case of diffusion, the ability for 
molecules to cross the placenta in either direction is strongly 
influenced by the interhemal distance or the thickness of the 
cellular barrier between maternal and fetal blood. A small 
interhemal distance generally will increase the rate at which 
molecules can transfer between maternal and fetal blood, 
either by diffusion or active transport. Thus, the number 
of cell layers separating the maternal from the fetal blood 
is considered to be important in modifying the transfer of 
nutrients and forming the materno-fetal barrier42–44. Actu￾ally, fatty acids and keto acids are readily transferred from 
dams to fetuses in the hemochorial placenta of rodents, rab￾bits and primates, whereas their uptake by ruminants, pigs 
and horses is very low42. In addition, the pig is not suitable 
as an informative model for the study of antibody therapeu￾tics in embryo-fetal toxicity studies, since the pig placenta 
is impermeable to the passage of macromolecules such as 
immunoglobulins45. Also, it is known that there are at least 
three different mechanisms for iron transport, according to 
the structure of the maternal-fetal interface46 (hemochorial, 
penetration; endotheliochorial, phagocytosis; epitheliocho￾rial, secretion). On the other hand, it is known that there are 
regions of the pig placenta where the six cell layers of the 
maternofetal barrier become sufficiently thinned to equal the 
minimal interhemal distance of the three cell layers in a hu￾man placenta, although the mean interhemal distance in the 
pig placenta is greater than the mean in the human placenta 
24. There does not appear to be any difficulty in allowing for 
the passage of substances based simply on the number of 
layers separating the different blood supplies, even though 
there may be differences in transit times8
. In addition, the 
disadvantage of the greater difficulty in passage of materi￾als between organisms is partially overcome by a variety 
of mechanisms20. Therefore, it has been reported that the 
interspecies differences in the type of placenta do not play a 
dominant role in the placental transfer of most drugs, which 
is determined largely by placental blood flow43. At any rate, 
it should be considered that the histological structure sepa￾rating the maternal blood from the fetal blood modifies the 
transfer of nutrients, and that the placental structure is one 
of the important factors for its permeability between differ￾ent animal species.
In conclusion, the chorioallantoic placenta shows mor￾phological diversity in experimental animals. In reproduc￾tive and developmental toxicity studies, careful attention 
should be paid to the histological structure of the interhemal 
area when extrapolating information concerning placental 
transfer characteristics to different animal species.
