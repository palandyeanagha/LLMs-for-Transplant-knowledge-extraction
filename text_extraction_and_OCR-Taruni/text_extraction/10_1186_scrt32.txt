Introduction
Th ere is a growing need for new ways to regenerate and 
repair injuries in organs. Most organs have limited 
inherent regenerative capacity, with scarring preventing 
full organ functioning. For instance, myocardial infarc tion 
is often followed by the myocardium being replaced with 
noncontractile scar tissue, which can further result in 
congestive heart failure [1,2]. In the case of bone, 
metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis cause abnormal 
bone loss and traumatic injuries lead to large lesions, 
which are incapable of self-regeneration. Th e search has 
therefore turned to novel ways to stimulate the original 
organogenic process and regenerate normal tissue.
Use of multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) or 
mesenchymal stem cells to reconstruct tissue looks 
extremely promising due to their trans-diff erentiation 
potential. MSCs have the ability to form cells of the 
connective tissue, muscle, heart, blood vessels and nerves 
[3-6]. Th ese cells are easy to isolate from almost all 
individuals; these cells are relatively safe as they rarely 
form teratomas [7]. In addition, these stromal cells off er 
several advantages over conventional therapy. MSCs 
respond to their environment by diff erentiating into the 
needed lineages. Th ese cells will therefore grow, remodel 
and adapt to changes in tissue functions over time. As 
MSCs derive from bone marrow, these can be isolated 
from most adults with the potential of autologous 
transplantation, not requiring immunosuppressive 
agents. Th is procedure is in contrast to traditional 
methods of transplantation that lead to infection, 
immune rejection or simply not enough material for 
large-scale grafts.
Preclinical animal studies have shown promise of using 
MSCs for tissue regeneration. Application of these cells 
has led to the formation of bone, the regain of ventricular 
function, and the restoration of renal tubular function in 
rodents [8-10]. Mice rendered paraplegic by spinal cord 
injury have recovered on MSC treatment [11,12]. Th e use 
of MSCs is limited, however, by their scarceness in the 
bone marrow, as they constitute only 0.001 to 0.01% of 
the bone marrow population. Since regeneration of large 
tissues requires around 107
 to 108
 MSCs [13], there exists 
a need for MSCs to be expanded prior to tissue 
regeneration. In culture conditions, however, prolifera￾tion of these cells is highly inconsistent – which subse￾quently impacts diff erentiation.
Even if the desired cell numbers are obtained, there is 
another hurdle to be crossed before diff erentiation of 
Abstract
Multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) have been touted 
to provide an alternative to conservative procedures of 
therapy, be it heart transplants, bone reconstruction, 
kidney grafts, or skin, neuronal and cartilage repair. 
A wide gap exists, however, between the number 
of MSCs that can be obtained from the donor site 
and the number of MSCs needed for implantation to 
regenerate tissue. Standard methods of MSC expansion 
being followed in laboratories are not fully suitable 
due to time and age-related constraints for autologous 
therapies, and transplant issues leave questions for 
allogenic therapies. Beyond these issues of suffi cient 
numbers, there also exists a problem of MSC survival 
at the graft. Experiments in small animals have shown 
that MSCs do not persist well in the graft environment. 
Either there is no incorporation into the host tissue, 
or, if there is incorporation, most of the cells are lost 
within a month. The use of growth and other trophic 
factors may be helpful in counteracting these twin 
issues of MSC expansion and death. Growth factors 
are known to infl uence cell proliferation, motility, 
survival and morphogenesis. In the case of MSCs, 
it would be benefi cial that the growth factor does 
not induce diff erentiation at an early stage since the 
number of early-diff erentiating progenitors would be 
very low. The present review looks at the eff ect of and 
downstream signaling of various growth factors on 
proliferation and survival in MSCs.

MSCs begins: the incorporation of MSCs into regener￾ating tissue. MSCs applied to regenerate porcine hearts 
following an infarct display only 5% survival in a 14-day 
period [14-16]. Similar results are seen on implantation 
of MSCs into mouse hearts with infarcts. While MSCs 
injected into nonischemic hearts survive better initially, 
one cannot fi nd viable cells after 4 weeks [17-19]. In rat 
brains with cerebral artery occlusion, allogenic and 
human MSC transplants also show very low survival [20]. 
Th e failure of these cells to regenerate tissue may thus 
simply be that they do not survive to contribute to the 
new tissue.
Th e reasoning behind low incorporation of MSCs may 
be attributed to poor viability of cells caused by ischemia, 
anoikis, loss of trophic factors or infl ammation at the 
graft site [21]. To test whether nonspecifi c infl ammation 
induced death of MSCs, Griffi th and colleagues subjected 
human MSCs to various nonspecifi c infl ammatory 
cytokines in vitro. MSCs were extremely susceptible to 
FasL-induced cell death and also died in the presence of 
TRAIL [22]. Not only does the infl ammatory response 
challenge transplanted MSCs – these cells are also 
considered for regeneration of tissues with harsh micro￾environments. For example, when used to regenerate 
cartilage, MSCs need to adapt to an avascular, low oxygen 
concentration and a low pH microenvironment 
characteristic of chondrocytes [23]. Taken together, the 
microenvironment in which MSCs are delivered, the 
presence of infl am mation, or the loss of trophic factors 
may play a role in maintaining a proliferating MSC 
population at the graft site (Figure 1).
On the contrary, there are reports of improved healing 
on MSC delivery. In a rat cerebral occlusion model there 
is signifi cant recovery in motor neuron function after 
MSC transplantation. Despite the low survival rate of 
MSCs in ischemic hearts, there is decreased scarring and 
increased neo-angiogenesis after MSC transplantation 
[24,25]. MSC injection has also helped to improve 
pulmo nary emphysema [26]. In all these cases, secretion 
of various growth factors and cytokines by MSCs is 
Figure 1. Various threats multipotential stromal cells face at the delivery site leading to loss of cells. Leukocytes and macrophages that are 
brought into the multipotential stromal cell (MSC) implantation site as part of the nonspecifi c infl ammatory response can secrete proinfl ammatory 
cytokines and chemokines, as well as increase cellular stress and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that might activate apoptotic cascades. 
Wound and ischemic sites where MSC therapy is usually required are low in vascularity and are hypoxic regions, which might add to MSC cell stress. 
Also, lack of attachment of MSC to the extracellular matrix (ECM) may cause MSC to detach, undergo anoikis and ultimately lead to cell death.

thought to bring about paracrine signaling and revival of 
endogenous tissue cells or suppression of harmful infl am￾mation [27]. Th e lack of demonstrated persistence of the 
transplanted MSCs has resulted in these aff ects being 
attributed not to MSC integration and regeneration of 
tissue, but to trophic eff ects brought about by these 
unique cells [28].
Th e role of growth factors in increasing proliferation 
and survival in MSCs has been widely studied over the 
past few years. Most growth factors are pleiotrophic, 
causing multiple biological eff ects. Th ey bring about 
changes in motility, proliferation, morphogenesis and 
survival. Th e search for the ideal growth factor for use 
with MSCs is still ongoing. While some groups aim at 
fi nding a growth factor not aff ecting diff erentiation, other 
groups opt for a growth factor that has diff erentiation 
preference towards a specifi c lineage. All groups, 
however, attempt to fi nd a factor that improves ex vivo
expansion and heightens survival on implantation. Th e 
present review explores the eff ects of various growth 
factors on MSC expansion and survival and the signaling 
mechanisms behind these eff ects.
Growth factor signaling behind MSC proliferation 
and population expansion
Transforming growth factor beta family of growth factors
Th e choice of growth factors to be used on MSCs was 
initially determined based on previously existing 
knowledge about the eff ect of a particular growth factor 
on cell morphogenesis. Th is was done with the dual 
pursuit of expanding MSCs and causing them to 
diff erentiate into the lineage that it was known to favor. 
Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), for example, is 
known to infl uence cells from the chondrogenic lineage 
in vivo, promoting initial stages of mesenchymal conden￾sation, prechondrocyte proliferation, production of 
extracellular matrix and cartilage-specifi c molecule 
deposition, while inhibiting terminal diff erentiation [29-
31]. When applied to MSCs in vitro to study chondrocyte 
regeneration, cells show increased proliferation and a 
bias towards the chondrogenic lineage [30,32]. TGFβ 
exists as three isoforms: TGFβ1
, TGFβ2
 and TGFβ3
. While 
all three isoforms induce proliferation of MSCs and 
chondrocyte formation, TGFβ3
 has been found to have 
the most pronounced eff ect on chondrogenesis and 
consistently increases proliferation of MSCs [33,34], 
making it a prime factor for induction of chondrogenesis 
from implanted MSCs.
Similarly, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 
through BMP-7 – factors belonging to the TGFβ super￾family – are known to aff ect bone formation. While 
BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 induce MSCs to 
form osteoblasts, BMP-2 has the greatest impact on 
diff erentiation [35]. MSCs overexpressing BMP-2 and 
implanted with the extracellular matrix protein collagen I 
as a hydrogel system increase proliferation of MSC 
diff erentiation into bone, and this model has been used 
to study cranial closures in swine [36,37]. Another 
member of the same family, BMP-3, increases MSC 
proliferation threefold [38]. Since these factors all aff ect 
bone formation at diff erent rates and some have a greater 
eff ect on proliferation, synergistic pairs of these growth 
factors can be used at optimal doses and at specifi c points 
during the bone regeneration process. One such search 
for synergistic pairs led to combination treatment of 
TGFβ3
 with BMP-2 on MSCs; chondrogenic diff er en￾tiation was found to be enhanced [39].
TGFβ signaling occurs when TGFβ or factors from the 
family bind a type II serine–threonine kinase receptor 
recruiting another such transmembrane protein 
(receptor I). Receptor I phosphorylates the primary intra￾cellular downstream molecules SMADs, causing their 
translocation into the nucleus and specifi c gene trans￾cription. Receptor I can be ALK-1, ALK-2, ALK-3, or 
ALK-6 that signal SMAD 1, SMAD 5, and SMAD 8, or 
can be ALK-4, ALK-5, or ALK-7 that signal SMAD 2 and 
SMAD 3. Signaling via SMAD 1, SMAD 5, or SMAD 8 is 
required for chondrocyte diff erentiation while signaling 
through SMAD 2 or SMAD 3 blocks chondrocyte 
diff erentiation [40]. TGFβ and members of this growth 
factor family can also signal via the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), Rho GTPase and phospho￾inositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways [41]. Th e eff ect of 
BMP-2 on proliferation and osteogenic diff erentiation of 
MSCs has been shown to occur via sustained signaling of 
the MAPK Erk [42]. Th e mitogenic eff ects of BMP-3, on 
the other hand, have been found to be mediated by 
TGFβ/activin signaling and not by any of the MAPK 
signaling pathways, with ALK-4 and SMAD 2 and SMAD 
3 being the key players involved [38]. Figure 2 shows how 
signaling via SMAD 2 or SMAD 3 leads to proliferation 
of MSCs but blocks terminal diff erentiation into 
chondrocytes, while signaling via SMAD 1, SMAD 5, or 
SMAD 8 potentially leads to chondrocyte diff erentiation 
in MSCs. Figure 2 also shows how sustained signaling via 
Erk leads to osteoblast formation.
Fibroblast growth factors
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of growth 
factors involved in wound healing and angiogenesis. 
Among the various members of this family, FGF-2 or 
basic fi broblast growth factor (b-FGF) has been used in 
MSC-related studies showing increased rabbit, canine 
and human MSC proliferation in vitro, with the mito￾genic eff ect being more pronounced when MSCs are 
seeded at lower densities [13,43-45]. b-FGF not only 
maintains MSC proliferation potential, it also retains 
osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic diff erentiation

to fi broblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF to epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) and binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor (PDGFR) causes phosphorylation of the respective receptors, causes recruitment of the adaptor protein Grb2 and the nucleotide 
exchange factor SOS, which causes activation of downstream pathways, primarily phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk. Phosphorylated Erk either enters the nucleus and activates transcription of cellular proliferation 
genes like c-myc, or activates downstream receptors like Rsk that then activates proliferation genes. Akt similarly prevents the expression of proteins 
like Myt1 and Wee1, which are involved in inhibiting proliferation. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 activates proliferation via the MAPK Erk 
pathway, unlike BMP-3 that activates Smad2 and Smad3 via Activin signaling. TGFβ3
 is the most potent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) 
mitogen causing proliferation via activation of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4. Binding of Wnt3a to the Frizzled receptor causes activation of the protein 
Dishevelled and inactivation of the Axin–APC–Gsk3 complex, which leads to a nuclear infl ux of β-catenin, activating the cell cycle proteins cyclin 
D1
 and c-myc. TGFβ also causes an infl ux of β-catenin in a Smad3-dependent manner. Binding of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to c-Met under
low doses causes activation of Erk and Akt, but under higher doses it inhibits proliferation by activating the p38 MAPK pathway and causing the 
expression of cell cycle progression inhibitors p21Waf1 and p27Kip. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; Gsk3, glycogen synthase kinase 3;

potentials through the early mitogenic cycles; eventually, 
however, all of the MSCs diff erentiate into the chondro￾genic line. Th ere is a report that b-FGF can extend the 
proliferation of MSCs for at least 80 population doub￾lings, which is in excess of the Hayfl ick number [45]. 
Other reports, however, do not fi nd this extension; rather, 
b-FGF may just decrease the doubling time [46] with the 
MSCs observing the Hayfl ick limitation [47]. Th is slowing 
and senescence of MSCs follows that seen in other cell 
types; as the cells reach senescence, their growth factor 
receptors become downregulated and signal attenuation 
is highly increased to bring about resistance to the 
growth factor stimuli [48,49].
FGF-4, another member of this growth factor family, 
also increases MSC proliferation at lower densities. In 
addition to MSC proliferation increasing fi ve times, the 
number of colony-forming units – indicative of progeni￾tor cell populations – increases by one-half [50]. Th is 
observation suggests not only that growth factors can 
drive prolifera tion; they could contribute to stem cell 
expansion and a greater number of cells undergoing 
diff erentiation. FGF signals proliferation through the 
MAPK cascade in various cell types. From microarray 
analysis, Tanavde and colleagues determined that MAPK￾Erk signaling might be involved in increased growth 
induction by b-FGF [51]. Th e schematic mechanism is 
presented in Figure 2.
Vascular endothelial growth factor
While investigating ways to better vascularize the MSC 
transplant site, it was noted that vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) increased MSC proliferation on its 
own [52]. Both endogenous and exogenously secreted 
VEGF has been found in porcine MSCs [53] but the 
amounts are too low for autocrine signaling. For in vivo
transplantation studies, therefore, MSCs have been either 
adenovirally transduced with the VEGF gene or injected 
with a VEGF peptide to bring about increased cell counts 
[54]. Some signaling studies imply that MSCs do not 
express the VEGF receptor. Th is could imply that VEGF 
stimulates MSC proliferation by activation and 
downstream signaling of the platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) receptors [55].
Platelet-derived growth factor
PDGFs are potent mitogens of MSCs [56] and these 
stromal cells express all forms of the growth factor: 
PDGF-A and PDGF-C at higher levels and PDGF-B and 
PDGF-D at lower levels. Both receptors PDGFRα and 
PDGFRβ are also expressed [57]. Th e two receptors 
homo dimerize or heterodimerize to generate overlapping 
but distinct cellular signals: PDGFRαα binds PDGF-AA, 
PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC and PDGF-AB; PDGFRββ binds 
PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD; and PDGFRαβ binds 
PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC and PDGF-AB. Several groups 
have found PDGF-BB to induce both proliferation and 
migration in MSCs [58-60]. While PDGFRβ inhibits 
osteogenesis, however, PDGFRα has been observed to 
induce osteo genesis [57]. Akt signaling has been pro￾posed to mediate both the suppression and induction of 
osteogenesis by PDGFR signaling [58]. As the two 
receptor isoforms present quanti tatively diff erent prefer￾ences for pathway activa tion, due to distinct phospho￾tyrosine motifs, defi nition of critical signaling elements 
will await a system’s approach to parse the delicate 
balance of competing impetuses.
Early studies with PDGF showed Erk to be responsible 
for MSC proliferation [60]. Recently, however, it was 
shown that while Erk gets phosphorylated in the presence 
of PDGF, addition of a PDGFR inhibitor does not change 
phosphorylation levels of Erk [61] – which might imply 
that Erk activation occurs not by direct PDGFR signaling 
but via a secondary pathway. Th e same group showed 
that increase of MSC proliferation occurs in a dose￾dependent manner due to Akt phosphorylation. Not only 
was there an increase in proliferation on Akt activation, 
there was also secretion of VEGF [61]. Further, VEGF 
was found to act as a ligand to PDGFR in MSCs [61]. Th e 
mitogenic pathways operative downstream of PDGFR 
activation are thus still uncertain.
Hepatocyte growth factor
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met 
are expressed at low levels in mouse MSCs [62]. While 
the low levels of HGF found in culture media are 
insuffi cient to activate the receptor, exogenous addition 
of HGF to MSCs triggers the activation of receptor, 
aff ecting proliferation, migration and diff erentiation. 
Interestingly, short-term exposure to HGF in MSCs 
activates Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt; these are the main 
pathways activated by HGF in other cell types [63]. 
Despite activation of these path ways, long-term exposure 
to the growth factor inhibits mitogenesis. In addition, 
exposure brings about cytoskeletal rearragement, cell 
migration and expression of cardiac markers. Th e 
inhibition of proliferation probably occurs by activation 
of p38 MAPK and blockade of G0
–G1
 phase transition. 
Th is signaling also induces the universal cell cycle 
progression inhibitor p21waf1 and p27kip proteins [64]. 
HGF therefore does not seem to be an ideal factor for use 
with MSCs. Table 1 summarizes the eff ects of the various 
growth factors on MSCs.
Epidermal growth factor and heparin-binding epidermal 
growth factor
Th e growth factors described above facilitate MSC pro￾lifer ation but bias diff erentiation into a particular lineage. 
Th is is helpful in generating specifi cally diff er en tiated

cells in culture. When injected into the body or when 
implanted at the site of requirement for a diff erent or 
multiple lineage, however, this bias can be counter￾productive. Adding to this, if the growth factors initiate 
diff erentiation, this competes with expansion and thus 
there may be insuffi cient cell numbers to completely 
regenerate the desired tissue. Th e search for a growth 
factor that does not cause MSC diff erentiation led to 
investigation of growth factors from the near-ubiquitous 
prototypal growth factor receptor family of ErbB1/
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR signal￾ing induces proliferation, motility and survival of MSCs. 
Two of the receptor’s ligands, epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) and heparin-binding EGF, promote ex vivo expan￾sion of MSCs without triggering diff erentiation into any 
specifi c lineage [60,65]. In addition to its mitogenic eff ect 
on MSCs, EGF also increases the number of colony￾forming units by 25% [15]. Th is observation indicates 
that treat ment with EGF would also be benefi cial for the 
maintenance of early progenitor cells.
Classical growth factors, upon binding to their cognate 
receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, activate 
several downstream pathways that lead to proliferation: 
Ras GTPase through Raf and MEK to the ERK MAPKs, 
PI3K activation of Akt/PKB, and the STAT pathways. 
Tamama and colleagues showed that EGF does not 
activate STAT3 for proliferation in MSCs, but rather 
triggers ERK strongly [60]. Heparin-binding EGF, the 
other EGFR ligand implicated in MSC proliferation, 
shows activation of ERK1/2 as well as phosphorylation of 
Akt, but the activa tion of Akt is signifi cantly lower than 
that by EGF. With activation of EGFR signaling, therefore, 
the overall population of both MSCs and their early 
progenitors will be high, leading to enough cells for tissue 
formation.
Wnt family
Th ere have been several confl icting fi ndings concerning 
Wnt signaling proliferation in MSCs. One set of studies 
suggests that canonical Wnt signaling maintains stem 
cells in an undiff erentiated but self-renewing state. 
Addition of Wnt3a by activating the canonical Wnt 
pathway increases both proliferation and survival while 
preventing diff erentiation into the osteoblastic lineage in 
MSCs [66]. Frizzled 1 and Frizzled 4 are present on 
undiff erentiated MSCs and are responsible for canonical 
Wnt transduction via Wnt3a. In addition, Wnt3a also 
increases the survival rate of MSCs. Wnt5a, a non￾canonical Wnt, competes for Wnt3a binding to the 
Frizzled receptor and negates the positive eff ect of Wnt3a 
on MSC proliferation [67]. Th e cell cycle progression 
factors cyclin D1
 and c-myc have been implied in both 
these signaling mechanisms [68]. Studies with Wnt4, 
another noncanonical Wnt, show no change in MSC 
proliferation [69]. Th e other set of fi ndings connotes that 
canonical signaling initiated by Wnt3a inhibits human

MSC proliferation [70]. A third set of studies, however, 
proposes that canonical Wnt signaling at low levels 
promotes proliferation while at higher levels inhibits 
MSC proliferation [71].
Part of the controversy surrounding Wnt signaling is 
the extensive crosstalk between Wnts and other signaling 
pathways that aff ect the fate of MSCs. TGFβ1
, for 
example, causes rapid nuclear translocation of β-catenin 
in a Smad3-dependent manner, causing enhanced 
prolifera tion and suppression of osteogenesis.
MSC survival and role of growth factors
A second cell behavior critical for the successful use of 
MSCs in regenerative repair is the survival of trans￾planted cells. Various growth factors – trophic factors as 
they are called in other cell types – have been queried for 
promoting this survival. VEGF is one factor that has been 
extensively used in MSC survival studies. MSCs treated 
with VEGF in vitro and MSCs carrying the VEGF gene in 
vivo have been shown to increase survival in these 
stromal cells. Rodent hearts that have undergone 
myocardial infarction and have been injected with MSCs 
along with the VEGF peptide show a higher number of 
MSCs at the site of injection [52]. Th e surge in survival is 
attributed to an increase in Akt signaling causing a 
reduction in infarct size, lesser fi brosis, increased 
vascularity and thicker ventricular walls [53,72]. Akt 
signaling in other cell types causes increased expression 
of prosurvival proteins XIAP, Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, and 
decreased levels of caspases and apoptotic proteins Bad, 
Bax and Bim. Akt signaling is also known to inhibit the 
transcription factors FOX01, FOX02 and FOX03 involved 
in causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [73].
MSCs pretreated with transforming growth factor 
alpha and implanted at the ischemic site after a 
myocardial infarction show increased survival. Th is 
improvement is also attributed to VEGF signaling, 
although direct signaling through the EGFR receptor 
cannot be discounted. Transforming growth factor alpha 
increases VEGF production via the p38 MAPK pathway 
and enhances recovery [74]. For the ischemic cardiac 
tissue, MSCs supplanted with VEGF have so far been the 
best choice for increased survival, leading to improved 
vascularity in ischemic cardiac tissue and isolated islets. 
Th e current issue of debate, however, is whether VEGF 
causes greater incorporation of MSCs and succeeding 
survival, or whether it brings about paracrine eff ects on 
surrounding endothelial cells, increasing angiogenesis 
and formation of more vessels.
Several other growth factors have proven to increase 
MSC survival. MSC transplantation with brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor into rodents 
after traumatic brain injury has shown a signifi cantly 
higher number of engrafted cells compared with MSCs 
transplanted without any growth factor [75]. PDGF-BB 
has been found to reduce the 46% loss of cells by 
apoptosis seen between days 5 and week 3 in rats 
following acute myocardial infarction [76]. Contrary to 
its limiting eff ect on MSC expansion, HGF causes a slight 
increase in MSC survival. PI3K signaling is implicated in 
this increase [64].
Another major growth factor studied for its eff ects on 
MSC survival is EGF. Since initial studies showed that 
EGF in the soluble state did not cause diff erentiation of 
MSCs but enhanced expansion, it was hypothesized that 
soluble EGF would similarly enhance survival of MSCs 
subjected to prodeath cytokines such as FasL and TRAIL 
in vitro. Contrary to what was expected, soluble EGF did 
not protect MSCs, but increased cell death in the 
presence of FasL [22]. Fan and colleagues then presented 
EGF to MSCs tethered to a biomaterial substratum 
(tEGF). Th is mode of presen tation of the same growth 
factor enhanced survival of MSCs in the presence of the 
proinfl ammatory cytokines. In addition to limiting cell 
death, tEGF also increased cell attachment and spreading, 
which might limit cell death by anoikis [22]. Th e survival 
brought about by tEGF was found to be mainly due to 
sustained levels of Erk activation, as opposed to transient 
Erk activation with soluble EGF. Furthermore, tEGF 
restricts the subcellular localization of activated EGFR. 
Unlike soluble EGF that causes the internalization and 
fi nally the degradation of EGFR, tEGF restricts EGFR and 
EGFR signaling to the plasma membrane, and thereby 
changes the spatio temporal balance of intracellular 
signaling pathways [77]. tEGF did not interfere with 
subse quent diff erentiation into osteoblasts under induc￾ing conditions while increas ing the effi ciency and the 
number of osteoid colonies [78]. As this was the fi rst 
study to directly challenge MSCs with proapoptotic 
infl am matory stimuli, the tech nique holds promise as a 
quantal advance in protecting MSCs from death in vivo. 
Th e cross-signaling of survival by various growth factors 
is represented in Figure 3.
Clinical issues of using growth factors in MSCs
Current limitations to using MSCs for regeneration 
include providing suffi cient numbers of these stromal 
cells in a timely manner in the challenging in vivo milieu. 
To bring about MSC expansion, fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
is currently employed since human serum does not fully 
support growth of MSCs in vitro. Complications arise in 
use of FBS for MSC transplants in vivo, however, since 
FBS contains undefi ned elements that can vary in 
inducing proliferation. More importantly, contaminants 
in FBS can cause infections, and, being of nonhuman 
origin, the components can trigger host immune reac￾tions [79]. On the commercial front, companies have 
developed serum-free and animal supplement-free MSC

Figure 3. Growth factor signaling pathways mediating survival in multipotential stromal cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) bind PDGFR, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds c-Met, which causes phosphoinositide-3 
kinase (PI3K) to be activated, converting PIP2 to PIP3 and activating Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). This leads to the inhibition of the Fork head family 
of transcription factors Foxo1, Foxo3 and Foxo4, and also causes inhibition of pro-death proteins Bim, Bad and Caspase9. At the same time there 
is activation of pro-survival proteins XIAP, Bcl2 and Bcl-xl. In addition, Akt activation causes activation of eNOS and HSP90, causing nitric oxide 
synthesis and angiogenesis that promotes survival. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in 
addition to activating Akt, brings together the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS and the small adapter protein Grb2, which activates 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: Ras-Raf-Mek1/2-Erk1/2. Activation of Erk leads to the expression of pro-survival proteins 
like NF-kB, Bcl2 and Bcl-xL. EGF binding to EGFR also causes PLCg to cleave PIP2 to IP3 and DAG, which activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKC can 
activate Raf and further cause downstream Erk activation. All these activated receptors, however, are quickly internalized by clathrin machinery 
or by alternate internalization mechanisms into the endosome where they continue to signal. The fi gure shows internalization of the EGF–EGFR 
complex continuing to signal in the cytosol, but once inside the lysosome, the receptor along with the ligand completely degrades and the 
survival signal is lost. Both the Akt and Erk signals generated therefore are acute and transient. Tethering of growth factors near the membrane, 
as in the case of EGF (tEGF), however, causes a more sustained signaling of Erk and Akt since the receptor–ligand complex signals for longer from 
the cell membrane, leading to multipotential stromal cell (MSC) survival for a more prolonged time period. Bcl2, B-cell lymphoma 2; DAG, diacyl

media. Th ese media products are comprised of synthetic 
supplements that are meant to replace serum, thereby 
reducing variability. Th e companies claim that MSCs 
grow as well in the media as in media supplanted with 
FBS. Th e proprietary composition of these products, 
however, goes against them for clinical use. Details of 
these products are summarized in Table 2. Th e use of 
growth factors as culture supplements instead of FBS 
therefore off ers the most promising alternative [80]. 
Search for a serum-free media to expand MSCs has led to 
combination treatments with PDGF-BB, FGF-2 and 
TGFβ1
 showing the most encouraging results. Th is 
treatment has not only brought about a synergistic eff ect 
on MSC proliferation, but has also retained the 
phenotype, diff erentiation and colony-forming potential 
of these cells [81].
In addition to using combined treatment of growth 
factors to improve proliferation, MSCs have been 
pretreated with a blend of growth factors to boost survival. 
Pretreatment of these stromal cells with FGF-2, BMP-2 
and insulin-like growth factor-1 before delivery into the 
ischemic heart has shown enhanced rates of survival [82].
One of the reasons MSCs are preferred for regenerative 
use is their genetic stability. MSCs are shown to maintain 
their diploid karyotype without aneuploidy, polyploidy or 
chromosomal structural abnormalities [83]. Th ere has also 
been a report, however, of MSCs displaying localized 
genetic alterations in the presence of FBS or autologous 
serum. Th e same report states that platelet lysate expands 
cytogenetically normal MSC colonies and that this eff ect 
may be due to the presence of growth factors such as EGF, 
PDGF and FGF in the platelet lysate [84]. In short, growth 
factors should be chosen not only based on expansion 
potential but also on not altering the MSC genome.
Th ere still remains the scare that while growth factors 
increase proliferation, this proliferation and the added 
protection off ered might let MSCs and surrounding cells 
escape control and lead to tumor growth. It is therefore 
important to have proper modes of growth factor 
delivery, which is localized, controlled and of a time￾limited nature. Controlled release of growth factors or 
presentation of the growth factor in bioengineered forms, 
such as tEGF, are some of the ways in which this can be 
achieved [39,78,85,86], discussion of which lies beyond 
the scope of the present review.
Conclusions and future directions
Growth factors are a promising adjuvant to MSCs to 
circumvent problems of MSC proliferation and 
expansion, and survival in vivo. Th e choice of growth 
factor(s), however, depends on three major criteria. First, 
the growth factor needs to prolong proliferation for 
several population doublings, to generate a considerable 
number of MSCs before these cells are to be diff erentiated 
into the desired tissue. Second, the growth factor should 
be able to completely replace the use of animal serum for 
proliferation purposes, to eliminate the use of xeno￾graphic substances and reduce variability. Finally, there 
need to be modes of localized and controlled delivery, 
which will help present the mitogenic and protective 
signals in sustained forms without letting MSCs escape 
into uncontrolled proliferation. While individual growth 
factors like b-FGF have advantages in steering MSCs 
down a select lineage after several population doublings, 
combination treatments of growth factors currently seem 
to be drawing a lot of attention due to their synergistic 
eff ect on MSCs. Composite treatment with PDGF, b-FGF 
and TGFβ1
 appears to be a good alternative for prolifera￾tion in vitro to replace serum. More studies need to be 
performed, however, to look into whether such a 
combination would accentuate survival and encourage 
grafting of cells in the wound microenvironment. Th ere 
also need to be ways by which such combinations can be 
delivered at the wound region.

While there have been several groups looking into the 
proliferation eff ects of growth factors and their eff ects on 
morphogenesis, much less attention has been paid to 
growth factor signaling for survival. Th is might partly be 
because MSCs were for a very long time considered to be 
cells with the advantage of survival. When MSCs were 
not observed in the body on delivery, the absence was 
attributed more to cells migrating away rather than to 
cells dying at the site. Only recently have there been 
studies showing that MSCs are susceptible to death by 
proinfl ammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, 
which might be the major reason for their loss at the site 
of delivery.
Th e advantage with the EGFR family of ligands is that 
work has been carried out on almost all aspects of MSC 
biology: eff ects on survival, proliferation, diff erentiation, 
migration and modes of delivery have been studied. Th is 
family of ligands appears to be generalized expanders and 
survival adjuvants while not aff ecting MSC diff er en￾tiation. More over, presenting EGF in a tethered form has 
been studied with respect to sustained signal ing, making 
it one of the factors of foremost importance. Taken 
together, the right choice of growth factors with proper 
modes of their delivery will help bridge the gap in MSC 
regenerative therapy and exploit the full potential of 
MSCs to regenerate tissue in the near future.
