Abstract. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying 
the onset and inexorable progression of the late‑onset form of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still the object of controversy. 
This review takes stock of some most recent advancements 
of this field concerning the complex roles played by the 
amyloid‑β (Aβ)‑binding p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) 
and calcium‑sensing receptor (CaSR) and by the primary cilia 
in AD. Apart from their physiological roles, p75NTR is more 
intensely expressed in the hippocampus of human AD brains 
and Aβ‑bound p75NTR triggers cell death, whereas Aβ‑bound 
CaSR signalling induces the de novo synthesis and release 
of nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)‑A and Aβ peptides (Aβs), particularly on the part of 
normal adult human astrocytes. The latter effect could signifi￾cantly increase the pool of Aβ‑ and NO‑producing nerve cells 
favouring the progressive spread of a self‑sustaining and 
self‑reinforcing ‘infectious’ mechanism of neural and vascular 
(i.e. blood-brain barrier) cell damage. Interestingly, primary 
cilia concentrate p75NTR receptors in their membranes and are 
abnormally structured/damaged in transgenic (Tg) AD‑model 
mice, which could impact on the adult neurogenesis occurring 
in the dentate gyrus's subgranular zone (SGZ) that is neces￾sary for new memory encoding, thereby favouring typical AD 
cognitive decline. Altogether, these findings may pave the 
way to novel therapeutic approaches to AD, particularly in 
its mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre‑MCI stages of 
development.

1. Introduction
Almost 2% of the people of Western industrialized countries 
are affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1,2). But what is this 
ailment that threatens a growing number people in our aging 
populations? It is a very slowly expanding neurodegenerative 
process that betrays its presence by disconnecting and ultimately 
destroying neural networks in the hippocampus, the brain's 
ancient memory‑recording and accessing ‘machine’ (3,4). The 
by far most common late onset AD (LOAD) cases account 
for over 70% of dementia cases in individuals >70 years of 
age (5). The incidence of AD increases exponentially with age 
and doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (1). In the rare 
early‑onset familiar AD (EOFAD) cases genetic mutations 
support an Aβ peptide overproduction (1,2). The LOAD patho￾genesis is still controversial; it begins 30‑40 years before the 
phenotypic emergence of clinical symptoms, in the entorhinal 
cortex and the dentate gyrus, where the aggregation‑prone 
Aβ1-42 peptides (Aβs), which derive from the sequential activity 
of two proteases, BACE1 and γ‑secretase, on the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP), progressively disrupt the neuronal 
networks (3‑8).
In normal brains, neurons release at synapses nontoxic 
Aβ42 monomers, the physiological levels of which are kept at 
low, safe levels by various clearance mechanisms involving 
the activation of proteases, phagocytosis by microglia and 
dumping into the blood by transporters such as LRP1 (4). But 
in the aging brains of susceptible persons the Aβ42 clearing 
mechanisms start to fail and the accumulating Aβ42 monomers 
will aggregate into toxic soluble oligomers and protofibrils 
driving the brain into the onset of the pathology (3,4). Thus, 
AD starts stealthily maybe as early as during childhood in a 
subcortical region such as the locus coeruleus, from which a 
prion‑like tau mutant would progressively spread and/or maybe

in the brain's default mode network (DMN), which includes 
the medial temporal memory‑recording region (3,4‑10). Aβs 
overproduction associates with the dangerous spread of phos￾phorylated tau protein (3,4,6). Ultimately, the functionally 
disturbed neurons cause a lethal accrual of the toxic prion‑like 
pE Aβ3-34 (pyroglutamyl Aβ3-34) along with the Aβs oligomers 
with which it associates (11‑15). Indeed pE Aβ3-34 is likely ‘the 
AD's hatchet man’ as it has been called by Jawhar et al (12).
In the present study we aim at updating some of the mecha￾nisms supporting AD development and progression, i.e. i) the 
interactions of two nerve cell membrane receptors with Aβs 
and their effects; ii) the complex involvement of a perhaps 
unduly overlooked class of glial cells, the astrocytes, in AD; 
and iii) the involvement of the primary cilia of neurons and 
astrocytes alike in AD. Here we shall briefly review such topics 
in their own contexts.
2. Nerve cell membrane receptors in AD
p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). The p75NTR is a TNF‑family 
low‑affinity receptor for neurotrophins such as nerve growth 
factor (NGF), neurotrophin (NT)‑3, NT‑4 and brain‑derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The interest in p75NTR role, if 
any, in AD development and progression was triggered by 
the studies of Yaar et al (16,17) and Kuner et al (18), who 
showed that Aβs could bind to both p75NTR monomers and 
trimers, thereby activating its intracellular signalling and 
inducing apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. At about 
such early times, we employed neuroblastoma cell clones 
that did not express any of the neurotrophin receptors or had 
been engineered to express full‑length or various truncated 
forms of the p75NTR to demonstrate that p75NTR binds Aβs via 
its extracellular domain and, as a consequence, via its death 
domain directly signals cell death. In fact, this signaling led 
to caspase‑8 and caspase‑3 activation and to reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production and cellular oxidative stress (19,20). 
Moreover, the direct and indirect (inflammatory) mechanisms 
of neuronal damage by Aβs could interact synergistically, since 
cytokines released from an activated microglia, like TNF‑α 
and IL‑1β, remarkably potentiated the neurotoxic actions of 
the Aβs̸p75NTR signaling (19,20). Altogether, these findings 
indicated that the privileged targets of the cytotoxic actions of 
Aβs in AD might be p75NTR‑expressing neurons endowed with 
receptors for proinflammatory cytokines (19,20).
Concurrently, by means of the same human neuroblastoma 
cell clones either devoid of all the neurotrophin receptors or 
expressing the full‑length or variously truncated forms of 
p75NTR, we could prove that the neuronal death induced by 
the prion protein fragment PrP106-126 is mediated through its 
binding to the extracellular domain of p75NTR and the subse￾quent signaling of its death domain causing the downstream 
activation of caspase‑8 and production of ROS (20,21). Since 
then other laboratories have corroborated the idea that the 
Aβs/p75NTR binding engenders a signaling causing neuronal 
apoptosis (22,23).
More recently, we demonstrated that, besides binding and 
activating p75NTR receptors, Aβ1-42 and its surrogate active 
peptide Aβ25-35, but not the reverse sequence Aβ42-1 peptide, at 
least double the membrane complement of p75NTR receptors in 
SH‑SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (24). We concurrently 
established that p75NTR is overexpressed above the level of 
corresponding wild‑type mice in the hippocampal membranes 
of two strains of AD transgenic mice, i) in 12‑15‑month‑old 
AD‑triple transgenic (Tg) mice (3xTg‑AD) harboring PS1 
(M146V), AβPP (Swe) and tau (P301L) and ii) in 7‑month‑old 
B6.Cg Tg-AD mice harboring PSEN1dE9 and AβPP (Swe). 
Importantly, this increase correlated with the age‑dependent 
rise in Aβ1-42 levels in the AD mice (24). Evidence was also 
gained that the Aβ42 oligomers known as Aβ‑derived diffusible 
ligands (ADDLs) induced the expression of p75NTR protein via 
the phosphorylation of insulin‑like growth factor‑1 receptor 
(IGF‑1R) in SH‑SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (25). An 
in vivo microinjection of ADDLs also increased the p75NTR
protein expression by 1.4‑fold in the ipsilateral hippocampus 
as compared to the non‑injected contralateral hippocampus. 
Moreover, in the ADDLs‑microinjected mouse hippocampi 
IGF‑1R phosphorylation surged within 30 min, while the 
co‑administration of picropodophyllin, an IGF‑1R kinase 
inhibitor, prevented any ADDLs‑induced p75NTR expres￾sion from occurring (25). In addition, in the hippocampi of 
6‑month‑old AβPPswe/PS1dE9 Tg-AD model mice that had 
accumulated significant amounts of Aβ1-42 a higher p75NTR
protein expression together with higher levels of IGF‑1R 
phosphorylation were detected with respect to the hippo￾campi from age‑matched wild‑type mice (25). Hence, Aβ42 
oligomer‑mediated IGF‑1R activation may trigger an increase 
in p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampus of a Tg-AD 
mouse model brain during the early stages of disease develop￾ment.
Notably, these findings raised an important question, 
i.e. whether the Aβ42's accumulation is also coupled with an 
increased hippocampal membrane‑associated p75NTR expres￾sion in human AD brains. Indeed, the mechanisms controlling 
the hippocampal expression of p75NTR are poorly known. 
It is a commonly held view that the p75NTR proteins are not 
expressed by the hippocampal nerve cells, but are carried to 
the hippocampus via the afferent axons of basal forebrain 
cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). Yet, BFCNs are selectively 
killed in the early phases of AD, which would entail a p75NTR
fall in the hippocampi of AD brains (26). On the other hand, 
a high concentration of p75NTR receptors is detectable in the 
membranes of the primary cilia of dentate gyrus granule cells 
in the mouse hippocampus (27). Others have reported p75NTR
protein expression in normal mice granule cell precursors up 
to the early postmitotic maturation of neuroblasts (28) and 
in dendritic spines and afferent terminals of hippocampal 
CA1 pyramidal neurons of normal C57BL/6 mice (29). 
To solve this question, we used polyclonal and monoclonal 
antibodies against the p75NTR receptor's intra- and extracel￾lular domains. Thus, we were able to show that the mean 
level of membrane‑associated p75NTR in the hippocampal 
formation is significantly higher (~2‑fold, p<0.03) in human 
AD brains than in identical samples of hippocampal forma￾tion in age‑matched non‑AD human brains (30). As yet, we 
do not know whether the same types of nerve cells express 
p75NTR receptors in murine and human hippocampi, respec￾tively. Nevertheless, an elevated membrane‑bound p75NTR in 
the human hippocampus could be another characteristic of 
AD. It remains to be determined whether and/or how such 
an increased expression of membrane‑bound p75NTR might be

a cause of the hippocampal destruction causing the cognitive 
decay in AD patients.
Calcium-Sensing Receptor (CaSR). The highly conserved 
CaSR gene encodes the CaSR protein, which belongs to 
family C of G‑protein‑coupled receptors (GPCRs), whose 
members have no sequence homology with those of other 
GPCR families (31). The CaSR's huge (>600 amino acids) 
bilobed extracellular N‑terminus domain looks like a Venus 
Flytrap (VFT), whose lobes are joined via a three‑strand 
hinge to 7 transmembrane α‑helices (TM1‑TM7) ending 
with the intracellular C‑terminus (32). A cysteine‑rich region 
(CRR) links the VFT to the 7TM region and is important 
for signal transmission from the VFT-like domain to the 
TM1‑TM7 (33). CaSR's intracellular tail includes two 
regions essential for its cell surface expression and biological 
activity (34). By rearranging the two 7TM regions, ligand 
binding permits the intracellular CaSRs C‑tails to bind 
various G proteins (Gqα, Giα and G11α) (35). CaSRs form 
homodimers (CaSR/CaSR) or heterodimers (CaSR/mGluR) 
in their membrane‑bound form, although they can function 
even as monomers (32). Dimers are assembled at the ER to 
allow CaSR transport to the plasmalemma (36). The huge 
VFT lobes of CaSR homodimers cooperatively bind ligands, 
e.g. Ca2+ (35). The CaSR detects changes in [Ca2+]e (35), but is 
a non‑selective receptor (37). Ca2+, di- and tri‑valent cations, 
antibiotics and polyamines are the CasR‑activating ortho￾steric agonists, whereas endogenous ligands or factors, like 
pH, ionic strength, [Na+
]e and aromatic L‑α‑amino acids are 
the allosteric CaSR modulators (37). Intracellular signaling, 
mediated via Ca2+ influx, has been connected to MAPK 
(MEK/ERK and JNK) activation, ion channel function, 
gene expression, cell proliferation and cell death (35). Most 
significantly, even Aβs do bind and activate the CaSR (38). 
Hence, CaSR‑expressing neurons and glial cells of all types 
are susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of the CasR‑activating 
Aβ42 oligomers and fibrillar aggregates (39). The interest 
in CaSR's role in AD pathogenesis has been increasing 
since the first evidence was gained of Aβ42̸CaSR interac￾tions in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (40). But CaSR 
expression by the astrocytes entails deep neuropathologic 
implications since they play significant roles in inflamma￾tory and degenerative brain diseases (39‑41). Using cultured 
phenotypically stable normal adult human astrocytes freshly 
isolated from the temporal lobe cerebral cortex we could 
show that exogenous Aβ‑stimulated CaSR signaling triggers 
i) the expression of nitric oxide synthase‑2 (NOS‑2); ii) the 
expression and activity of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), 
which produces tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4); and iii) the 
synthesis and release of large amounts of NO on the part of 
the BH4‑dimerized̸activated NOS‑2 (41‑44). In its turn, the 
overproduced NO can be fairly damaging to neurons and 
glial cells (see also below).
Moreover, using the same cultured phenotypically 
locked‑in normal adult human astrocytes exposed to normoxic 
conditions we could demonstrate that the Aβs̸CaSR interac￾tion also induces within 18‑24 hours the nuclear translocation 
of the hypoxia‑inducible HIF1α/HIF1β transcription complex 
that drives the expression of three VEGF‑A splice variants 
(VEGF‑A121, VEGF‑A165 and VEGF‑A189) and the increased 
synthesis and secretion especially of VEGF‑A165 (45 and 
unpublished results).
Finally, and perhaps most interesting of all, the 
Aβ‑activated CaSR signalling also stimulates the normal 
human adult astrocytes in culture to make significant amounts 
of their own Aβ42 oligomers (46), which accumulate inside the 
cells but are also released into the medium (our unpublished 
results). Thus the Aβ̸CaSR‑evoked signalling can simultane￾ously modulate the expression̸production of NO, VEGF‑A 
and Aβ42 in human astrocytes.
3. Astrocytes in AD
Neurons have attracted the most attention from people 
trying to understand AD pathophysiologic mechanisms (3,4). 
Obviously they are very important in the AD story and with 
them die the person's cognition and ultimately other func￾tions. Concerning glial cells, undeniably there are more 
astrocytes than neurons in the human brain, although there 
are arguments about the size of this majority that ranges 
from 1.4- to 10‑fold the actual neurons' numbers (47). Until 
recently, astrocytes have been relegated to simple janitorial 
roles: they have not been believed to be able to make Aβs, but 
only to sweep them up and then die if and when they accumu￾late too much of Aβs (48), as Aβs are supposedly only made 
and released by the neurons. There is an increasing realiza￾tion that astrocytes are much more important than previously 
thought; they actually protect neurons and are in fact the 
neuron partners in synaptic formation and function. They 
physically cradle or embrace neurons (Fig. 1) (49), shielding 
them from the signaling noise of neighboring neurons. They 
keep their neuron synapses optimally functional by regulating 
synaptic K+
, by sweeping up secreted neurotransmitters (e.g., 
glutamate) from the synaptic space and removing transmit￾ters spilled into the nearby space by neighbouring neurons. 
Astrocytes also collaborate in neuronal signaling with their 
own gliotransmitters, and they can stimulate synapse forma￾tion (47‑50).
Recent findings have added a novel facet to this picture 
(Fig. 2). Astrocytes are no longer just by‑standing synapse 
blankets that only clean up the Aβs released from shattered 
neurons in, for example, the increasingly cognitively disabled 
AD brains. Astrocytes are actually stimulated by their neuron 
Aβs to make and secrete their own Aβs (46 and unpublished 
results). This means that as astrocyte‑contacting neurons in 
key regions of the brain enter the covert early stages of AD 
and start over‑secreting Aβs, they directly spray the astro￾cytes with their Aβs. The exciting finding is that this causes 
the same astrocytes to make and release their own Aβs and 
spread them to other neurons in local networks, stimulating 
such neurons to join and enlarge the pool of cells making 
Aβs. In this way, Aβs‑exposed astrocytes act as vectors of 
a contagious, self‑sustaining and Aβs‑spreading disease. But 
this might not last, as the accumulating Aβs released from 
both neurons and astrocytes reach a level that stimulates 
the latter cells to start making large amounts of nitric oxide 
(NO), from which highly toxic peroxynitrites (ONOO-
) can 
be engendered (41‑44). Both these diffusible agents damage 
neurons and astrocytes to the point of inducing cell death. 
Obviously, the progressive loss of astrocytes besides neurons

neuronal somata and ~3x105
 synapses to optimally configure themselves in response to neuronal activity, insulate their neurons from the signaling noise such 
as glutamate spilled over from the neighbors, regulate synaptogenesis, clear away and recycle released glutamate and K+
 from the synaptic space and to directly 
exchange various gliotransmitters (ATP, glutamate, D‑serine, TNFα) and most importantly in the present context Aβs (47,49).
Figure 2. It is known that exogenous Aβ1‑42 can stimulate both astrocytes and neurons to produce and secrete endogenous Aβ1‑42 (46 and our unpublished 
results). Thus it seems likely that because of their intimate association the initiation of Aβ1‑42 overproduction and synaptic release by a neuron (Step 1) can 
recruit the production of Aβs by the associated astrocytes (Step 2) which in turn can stimulate other neurons to start making and releasing Aβs (Step 3), 
inducing the disconnection of so called ‘undead’ neurons that eventually die (Step 4).

impairs synaptic function and the provision of supplies from 
the circulation (47,49,51).
Amongst other activities, astrocytes send informa￾tion about the activities of the neurons they cradle to their 
end‑feet on local blood vessels, which adjusts the blood flow 
to provide the glucose and oxygen needed to feed the busy 
neurons. However, as in vitro (45), the accumulating Aβs in 
the key regions of the pre‑AD brain such as the dentate gyrus
and the CA3 subregions also stimulate astrocytes to make 
VEGF-A (52‑54), which as expected stimulates the growth 
of blood vessels (Fig. 3). This increase in the local vascular 
density magnifies the blood flow and the blood oxygen‑depen￾dent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
signaling from an active region such as a hippocampus trying 
to respond to a dentate gyrus̸CA3‑directed task (55,56). 
This has been wrongly interpreted as if the already declining 
hippocampi of AD‑bound people with pre‑AD mild cogni￾tive impairment (MCI) are hyperactive, which they are 
not (57‑59). Again, in the early stages the VEGF‑expanded 
vascular networks are intact and the blood vessels are func￾tional, but this ends when the accumulating Aβs stimulate 
the astrocytes (and microglia) to make huge, damaging 
amounts of NO, which contributes to the perforation and 
severing of the blood vessels and with this the breaching of 
the blood‑brain barrier and its disastrous consequences for 
brain function (60,61) (Fig. 3).
4. Nerve cell primary cilia in AD
Contrary to the old neurological tenet, in the brain of adult humans 
and rodents there are two principal areas in which neurogenesis 
does occur, the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus
and the subventricular zone (SVZ) (62‑64). In the hippocampal 
SGZ a pool of neural stem cells, the astrocyte‑like type 1 radial 
glial cells, are able to produce new granule cells when they are 
needed for memory encoding (65,66). These cells express some 
properties of the astrocytes, including glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), the typical astrocytic marker, are endowed with 
vascular end‑feet and occupy their special SGZ niche: the upshot 
is a blood vessel‑associated gap‑junctionally interconnected 
Figure 3. The Aβs accumulating in the preAD (i.e., MCI) brain's hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA3 subregions stimulates astrocytes to make and release large 
amounts of the potently angiogenic VEGF (45). (A) This increases the local vascular density. Stimulating the neuronal activity in this region will increase the 
blood flow through the expanded vascular network and with it the blood oxygen‑dependent (BOLD) fMRI signaling. However, this Aβ‑induced angiogenesis 
will falsely indicate hyperactivity from the hippocampal subregions, which have been caused to atrophy by the accumulating Aβs. (B) However, as the brain 
converts from MCI to AD, the excessive accumulation of Aβs and the resulting production of large amounts of NO will perforate and sever the blood vessels 
and break through the blood‑brain barrier (60,61).

astrocytic syncytium. Most of these cells possess non‑motile, 
4‑8 µm‑long sensory antennas protruding from their bodies, the 
primary cilia, wrapped in a plasma membrane that is stuffed 
with various kinds of receptors. Among the receptors found in 
the rodent granule cell cilia are the p75NTR receptor (10,24,39), 
the somatostatin type 3 receptor (SSTR3) (67,68) and the Sonic 
hedgehog (Shh) system's smoothened (SMO) and Patched (Ptch) 
proteins (65,69‑72). Conversely, the neurotrophin tyrosine 
kinase receptor TrkA does not co‑localize in the primary cilia 
membrane. Signals from the receptors on these cilia are believed 
to drive several fundamental activities such as neurogenesis, 
neuroblast maturation and memory encoding. Neurotrophin 
(e.g., BDNF)‑induced p75NTR signalling from the primary cilia 
drives the proliferation of granule cells precursors in the SVZ of 
the dentate gyrus, as preventing this signalling severely reduces 
neurogenesis (65,66,73).
How these primary cilia might be involved in AD‑linked 
cognitive deterioration? It appears that the accumulating toxic 
Aβ42 oligomers in AD brains at first stimulate the proliferation 
of GC progenitors. But later, when such oligomers are caught 
in the fibrillary plaques, the newly formed neuroblasts cannot 
mature or ultimately survive (74‑76). The failure of the newly 
generated neurons to mature and the resulting granule cell 
layer shrinkage and memory failure is likely, at least partly, 
to be due to the characteristic decline of somatostatin in AD 
and with it of the cilial SSTR3 signalling needed for memory 
encoding (65,66). These notions enticed us to surmise that 
primary cilium damage may cause the crippling decline of new 
memory formation in AD (77). This view is supported by the 
striking shortening of dentate gyrus granule cell primary cilia 
linked to the strongly reduced neurogenesis in AD Tg mice 
accumulating both Aβ42 and tau protein (78,79).
Moreover, cilial p75NTR can be bound and activated by 
Aβ42 (19,22). This would elicit an initially increased neural 
progenitor cell proliferation in the early stages of AD (80‑82), 
meanwhile, the hippocampal supply of acetylcholine (Ach) 
is progressively reduced by the accumulating Aβ42 that kills 
Ach‑producing basal forebrain cholinergic septal neurons 
(BFCSNs) (83). Thus, despite the increased Aβ42/p75NTR‑stim￾ulated progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis is not actually 
increased because fewer progenitor cells survive in the lack of 
Ach and cilial SSTR3 receptor signalling essential for neuro￾blasts maturation and de novo memory encoding (65) is silenced 
by the absence of SST in AD brains (66,84).
In this context, a mention is deserved by the Leptin‑induced 
signalling from Leptin b‑receptors located in the cell (not 
primary cilium) membrane, which may also stimulate, via the 
Shh Smo and the release of cilium‑located Gli‑A nuclear tran￾scription factor, the primary cilium‑dependent proliferation of 
transit‑amplifying progenitors in the dentate gyrus of the adult 
hippocampal formation (85). It follows that daily doses of Leptin 
might halt AD development if given perhaps in the pre‑MCI or 
MCI stage of the ailment (86).
However, some caution is at present warranted. These tiny 
primary cilia are a technical challenge to isolate and directly 
analyse. In addition, we presently do not know whether human 
dentate gyral granule cells are ciliated or whether human 
neuroblast maturation and integration into the granule cell 
layer of SVZ are also driven from primary cilia. On an encour￾aging note, we have indeed found ciliated cells in samples of 
hippocampi from octogenarian normal and AD humans and 
in phenotypically normal astrocytes isolated from adult human 
cerebral cortices (82).
5. Conclusions
It is quite clear from the foregoing discussion that AD will 
not be understood by only considering neurons (3,4) and 
microglia (87). We must take into account the intimate 
collaboration between neurons and their astrocyte cradlers 
and trans‑network communications. In other words we must 
pay serious attention to the astrocytes' roles in AD. Moreover, 
at the subcellular level, important protagonists are emerging 
such as primary cilia and receptors such as the p75NTR and the 
CaSR (88), as their interactions with Aβs can modulate or alter 
fundamental cellular functions like Aβ42, NO, VEGF‑A and 
proinflammatory cytokine production and release, prolifera￾tive responses and̸or damage and malfunctioning of cerebral 
blood vessels, neurogenesis and cell death. Although as for now 
the AD picture seems to be more intricate than ever, we hope 
that these and other new acquisitions on the pathophysiologic 
mechanisms of this ailment will help pave the way to novel, 
hopefully effective therapeutic approaches.
