Abstract
QuantSeq provides an easy protocol to generate highly strand-
specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries close to the 3′
end of polyadenylated RNAs within 4.5 h. Only one fragment per
transcript is generated, directly linking the number of reads
mapping to a gene to its expression. QuantSeq reduces data analysis
time and enables a higher level of multiplexing per run. QuantSeq is
the RNA sample preparation method for accurate and affordable
gene expression measurement.
