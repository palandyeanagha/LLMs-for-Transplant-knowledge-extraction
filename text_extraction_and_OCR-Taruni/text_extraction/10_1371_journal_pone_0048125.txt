Abstract
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections occur chiefly as a result of unhygienic conditions. The purpose
of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies to both viruses in central Burkina Faso in the absence of
a recorded hepatitis epidemic. Serum samples from 178 blood donors (131 males and 47 females) and from 189 pregnant
women were collected from November 2010 to March 2012, at blood banks and medical centers in Burkina Faso. An
immunochromatography test was used to screen for Anti-HAV IgM and IgG in a subgroup of 91 blood donors and 100
pregnant women. The seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 14.3% [CI95, 7.1–21.4%] for all blood donors and 23% [CI95,
14.8–31.2%] for pregnant women. Anti-HEV IgG were detected using the ELISA kits Dia.pro and Wantai and were found in
19.1% [CI95, 13.3–24.9%] of the blood donors and 11.6% [CI95, 7.1–16.2%] of the pregnant women. The seroprevalences of
anti-HAV and anti-HEV IgGs did not differ significantly between men and women blood donors. Anti-HAV IgM was detected
in 3.3% of the blood donors and in 2% of the pregnant women. These findings for asymptomatic individuals indicate that
the HAV and HEV circulate at low but significant levels. This is the first evaluation of the acute hepatitis virus burden in
Burkina Faso and the underlying epidemiologic status of the population.

Introduction
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are the
leading causes of acute viral hepatitis in the world. In developing
countries, these infections are associated with poor hygiene and, in
particular, the lack of clean drinking water and, in some areas,
inadequate sanitation [1–3]. It is estimated that 1.5 million new
HAV infections occur each year and that one-third of the world’s
population is infected with HEV [4]. These viruses spread by the
fecal-oral route usually through contact between people [5] or by
ingestion of contaminated food or water [6].
HAV belongs to the genus Hepatovirus and is a member of the
Picornaviridae family [7–9]. HAV is a non-enveloped virus 27–32
nm in diameter. The viral genome is a single-stranded RNA of
positive polarity, which is non-segmented and is packaged in an
icosahedral capsid. HAV strains belong to a single serotype.
However, there are seven viral genotypes (I–VII) and viral strains
of the same genotype share greater than 85% nucleotide identity.
Viruses of four of the genotypes (I, II, III and VII) have been
recovered from human HAV cases, whereas viruses of the other
three genotypes (IV, V and VI) have each been isolated only from
a different simian species developing a hepatitis A-like illness
during captivity [10,11]. HAV occurs in all countries of the world
and the incidence of infection varies with the local socioeconomic
conditions and health standards [9]. HAV infection is almost
always clinically silent in children under three years of age but is
usually symptomatic in adults and is sometimes severe. In infected
individuals aged 40 years or more, the mortality rate exceeds 2%
[12].
HEV was classified as a new Hepeviridae family on the basis of its
structure and genome organization. The Hepevirus genus is still the
only known member of this family [13]. HEV is a non-enveloped
cubic-shaped virus 27–33 nm in diameter and has tooth-like
projections on its surface. The viral genome consists of a single￾stranded RNA of positive polarity. Four major HEV genotypes,
subdivided into 24 subtypes (some being the result of recombina￾tion), have been identified through classification and regional
genotypic analyses [14], The different genotypes exhibit 72–77%
sequence identity and there is 85–90% identity within subtypes
[14,15]. Unlike other hepatitis viruses, humans are not the only
natural host of this virus. Recent work shows that there are large
reservoirs of HEV in various animal species, especially pigs,
rabbits and ferrets, suggesting that HEV is a zoonotic agent
[16,17]. HEV has an extensive global distribution, is endemic in
many poor countries and causes occasional epidemics [13]. In
developed countries, many of the HEV infections are imported,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e48125

although there is low background of local infection [18,19]. The
endemic background in Western Europe is higher than in other
developed zones, and is mainly associated with genotype 3 viruses
and a potential reservoir in pigs [20–23]. Although the symptoms
are generally mild, HEV infection is responsible for high mortality
rates (up to 20%) in pregnant women, especially during the three
first month of pregnancy [24–26]. HEV is endemic in regions
where the water supply may be contaminated with animal waste,
such as in Central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of South
America and Africa. There have been major waterborne
epidemics in refugee camps in Somalia [27] and Sudan [28],
causing sickness and death. The groups of people at risk include
those with liver disease, the elderly and the immunocompromised
[29,30].
Thus, HAV and HEV are both food and waterborne
pathogens. They share the same routes and mechanisms of spread
and they both cause similarly severe epidemics.
Although we conducted preliminary evaluations of food-borne
viruses In Burkina Faso in 2005 and 2008, little is known about the
prevalence of HAV and HEV in food [31,32]. The inhabitants of
Ouagadougou are undoubtedly exposed to these viruses as
a consequence of the socioeconomic situation, the hygiene
standards and the nutritional habits marked by the consumption
of street-vended products [32]. Indeed, an evaluation of the
etiology of severe diarrhea in infants in Burkina Faso demonstrat￾ed the involvement of rotavirus and adenovirus in these disease
outbreaks. Both of these viruses are, like HEV and HAV,
transmitted by the fecal-oral route [33,34]. Here, we report an
analysis of the seroprevalence of HAV- and HEV-specific
antibodies in the population of Burkina Faso.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out according to the routine practices of
the Regional Blood Transfusion Center of Ouagadougou (RBTC￾O) and the Medical Center Surgical unit of Samadin (MCS), and
was approved by the Ethics Committee for Health Research
(ECHR): ‘‘Comite´ national d’e´thique pour la recherche en sante´
(CNERS). Ministe`re de la Sante´ 03 BP 7009. Ouagadougou 03,
Burkina Faso’’. All subjects participating in the study signed
a voluntary consent form after being given all the information
necessary and sufficient to make an informed decision regarding
their participation in this study.
Study design and population
The study was carried out between November 2010 and
January 2011, and then in March 2012. The study population of
blood donors and pregnant women was classified into represen￾tative groups. Serum samples from 178 blood donors and 189
pregnant women attending the Medical Center of Samadin for
prenatal HIV testing who were found to be fit to donate blood
after the medical interview were used (367 samples in total). Blood
samples were collected according to the international rules of
blood donation as described by Rouger (2006) [35].
Sampling
A volume of 5 ml of whole blood from each donor was obtained
by venipuncture and collected into a dry tube. Blood samples were
transported to the laboratory and kept at 4uC for overnight for
sedimentation. The samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 10
min at 25uC. Sera were gently collected into cryotubes (NalgeneH)
and stored at 22065uC until the serological analysis.
Serological tests
All serum samples were analyzed for specific anti-HAV IgM
and IgG using an immunochromatographic test (SD Bioline IgM/
IgG anti-HAV; Standard Diagnostics, Inc., Korea) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. This test has a sensitivity of 97.6%
and a specificity of 98.0%. Serum samples were also screened for
anti-HEV IgG by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
tests (DIA.PRO Diagnostic Bioprobe Srt, Italy or Beijing Wantai
Biological Pharmacy Enterprise CO., LTD, China). Positive and
negative controls were included in all the ELISA microplates. The
results were scored as positive or negative according to the
standard procedures recommended by the manufacturer.
Data processing
The data were processed, analyzed and plotted using Excel
2007 and GraphPad Prism 5.0d. 95% confidence intervals were
calculated (CI95); Chi-2 and corrected P values were obtained
using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute, USA).
Results
Seroprevalence of anti-HAV immunoglobulin
The results of screening blood donors and pregnant women for
anti-HAV IgM and IgG are shown in Table 1. Nine samples from
blood donors did not give results that could be interpreted.
The donor population included more men 69/91 than women
22/91, but the prevalence of anti-HAV IgG did not differ between
women (18%, CI95 [2–34%]) and men (13%, CI95 [5–20%]).
The seroprevalence of anti-HEV was slightly higher among
pregnant women (23%, CI95 [14–31%]) than blood donors. The
prevalence of anti-HAV IgM was similar for all three groups. The
presence of anti-HAV IgM indicates a history of recent HAV
infection, but as blood donors are questioned about clinical illness
before blood is collected, any these infections were presumably
asymptomatic.
The prevalence of anti-HAV antibodies according to age is
shown in Figure 1. The anti-HAV prevalence increased slightly
from the ,25 age group to the .36 age group. Anti-HAV
seroprevalence was high in the 46–55 years age group, whereas no
positive cases were detected in the 56–65 years age group (data not
shown). There were no significant differences between the age
groups and no trend for a decrease or an increase of prevalence
with age. Few subjects were anti-HAV IgM positive, and all
positive subjects were ,25 or 36–45 years old.
Seroprevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin
Pregnant women and in blood donors were screened for anti￾HEV IgG (table 2 shows the prevalence according to age and
group). There was no significant difference between general
prevalence in January 2011 and that found by subsequent analysis
in March 2012. There is recent evidence from England and
France that a new ELISA test (the Wantai kit) detects previously
unrecognized cases of anti-HEV seropositivity. We therefore
compared the values obtained with the Dia.Pro test and the newly
available Wantai kit for the samples collected from the blood
donor group in 2011. With the Dia.Pro test, 19.1% of 89 blood
donor samples from 2011 were positive, whereas 14.6% of the
same samples scored positive and 4.5% indeterminate in the
Wantai test. We repeated the comparison in a new set of sera
obtained in 2012 from blood donors and pregnant women. The
distribution of optical density (O.D.) values obtained for the 189
samples with the Dia.Pro and Wantai tests are shown in Figure 2.
Despite a large difference in the range of positive values between
the two kits, the total number of positive samples was not very

different; however, as for the previous comparison, samples scored
as indeterminate in the Wantai test were positive in the Dia.Pro
test (five sera). There was a very good correlation between the
O.D. values for the two tests (Figure 3). Although the slopes were
the same for the two groups, the correlation coefficient was higher
for blood donors (r2= 0.95) than for pregnant women (r2= 0.71);
indeed, the correlation for pregnant women showed a significant
deviation from the linearity (Runs test p = 0.0092).
Dia.Pro test data were used for all subsequent analyses of
prevalence (Table 2). The anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence in female
blood donors (11/47, 23%, CI95 [7–40%]) was not significantly
different from that in male donors (23/131, 16%, CI95 [11–
24%]). The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG among pregnant women
(11%, CI95 [7–16%]) was lower than that in the entire blood
donor group (19% CI95 [13–25%]); the difference with the female
blood donor (non pregnant) group was highly significant, with an
Odds Ratio ratio of 2.3 (CI95 [1.7–3.24], x2= 4.31, p,0.05).
This may have been because the women blood donors were older
than the pregnant women.
This difference between pregnant women and blood donors
remained significant when the data from the two sampling dates
were analyzed independently. However, there was an unexpected
large difference between the distributions of seroprevalence
according to age in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 4A, 4B). In 2011
anti-HEV IgG seropositive blood donors were all in the ,25 and
26–35 age groups, and there were no seropositive in the older age
groups; the decrease in seroprevalence with age was significant
(x2= 4.4 p = 0.038 (Figure 4A). This unexpected pattern was not
found with the samples collected in 2012 which, by contrast,
showed an increase of seroprevalence with age (but not significant
x2= 1.32 p = 0.257; Figure 4B).
Discussion
This study investigating the prevalence of anti-HAV and anti￾HEV seropositivity in Ouagadougou is the first of its kind in
Burkina Faso. For epidemiological purposes, blood donors can be
considered to approximate to the healthy ‘‘general population’’.
However, the age criteria for blood donation and the elimination
of samples found to be positive for hepatitis B and C antigens or
for HIV antibodies could lead to an underestimation of the
prevalence of anti-HAV and anti-HEV seropositivity in the
general population. The group of pregnant women was not

subject to such limitations but may have presented other biases as
it included only young adult women attending prenatal clinics.
Nevertheless, these two groups together may be fairly represen￾tative of the general population.
Hepatitis, manifest as jaundice, is common in Burkina Faso, but
biological investigations are often conducted late, limited to
chronic disease and involve only HCV and HBV testing. Cases of
acute hepatitis may be diagnosed without determining either the
virology of the infection or whether the jaundice is HBV- (HbsAg)
negative. There have been few investigations of anti-HAV
seroprevalence [36]. Our study detected HAV infection endemi￾cities of 14.3% (CI95 [7.1–21.5%]) in blood donors and 23%
(CI95 [14–31%]) in pregnant women. The difference between
these two groups could be due by the close proximity of these
women to children who are considered to be potential carriers of
the virus [37,38]. The seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgM indicates
that the incidence of infections is relatively high and that there is
a risk of major outbreaks if vaccination is not continued.
The proportions of anti-HAV seropositives in the different age
groups of blood donors revealed a high prevalence (50%) in the
group of 46–55 year olds. The different rates of seropositivity
between the different age groups suggests age-related HAV
exposure in Burkina Faso, a phenomenon probably associated
with the severity of the disease increasing with age. In the United
States, the hospitalization rates for hepatitis A infections are 3%
for individuals younger than 18 years and 13% for individuals
older than 18 years. The fatality rate is 0.3% overall, but it is
higher than 2% for individuals over 40 years old [12]. The
seroprevalence we observed in the 26–35 year old group (18.7%)
agreed with the findings of Dubois et al. (1992), Denis et al. (2003),
and Poda (2010) [36,39,40], and is consistent with the idea that
young adults are the most highly exposed and sensitive to
infection. Indeed, the dietary habits of young adults, who
frequently choose ready-to-eat food and fast-food, have been
recognized as health-risk factors because poor quality control and
undercooking of these products are commonplace in Burkina Faso
[32]. Studies in other emerging or developing countries around the
world have shown that the prevalence of HAV infection decreases
as the living conditions of the populations improve [41–46]. This
in accordance with the situation in Burkina Faso characterized by
its low income and the poor hygienic status of a major part of
population in the capital Ouagadougou, associated with high
prevalence of hepatitis. Indeed, the causes of acute hepatitis, the
most common clinical sign of HAV and HEV infection, led us to
evaluate the prevalence of these two viruses in parallel in our
population.
Recently, the use of the ‘‘Wantai’’ kit in the UK and France led
to the identification of higher rates of HEV positivity than
suggested by previous studies using the Dia.pro kit. However,
when we tested our Burkina Faso cohort in blind using both

methods we found a very similar result for the two tests. If this
result was related to the genotype of the circulating HEV or to
a specific immune status in the Burkinabe population remained to
be assessed. The seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG among
Ouagadougou blood donors (19.1%, CI95 [13–24%]) was higher
than those reported for Italy (2.6%), Germany (2.1%) and
California (1.2%) but was close to that found in the south of
France (16.6%) [47–49]. The seroprevalence of HEV found in this
study was similar to those observed in Tunisia (22%), Burundi
(14%), Singapore (14.5%) and South Africa (15.3%) [50–52]. The
anti-HEV seroprevalence in our group of pregnant women
(11.6%, CI95 [7.1–16.2%]) from the Burkina Faso plateau region
of which Ouagadougou is the center, was lower than those found
in most of these other countries but was comparable to those found
in pregnant women in Tunisia (12.1%) and Turkey (12.6%)
[53,54]. Low prevalences (1–5%) have been reported for countries
with low HEV endemicity, such as the United States or those in
Northern Europe [55,13]. The HEV seroprevalence among
pregnant women (11.6%) was slightly lower than that of either
men or women blood donors (17.6% and 23.4%, respectively).
Other studies of pregnant women reported similar patterns in
Gabon (10–20%). These findings may be related to differences in
socioeconomic status of the pregnant women, but we did not
record any such data in our study [56]. We found the highest anti￾HEV seroprevalence in the ,25 years of age group (Figure 4C),
which has been reported to be at high risk for HEV infection
worldwide [13,57,58]. Nevertheless, in endemic areas, childhood
hepatitis E infections are frequent than childhood hepatitis A
infections. HEV is an infection of young adults, with the peak
incidence between the ages of 15 and 35 years [59,60]. Our study
was limited to this age class and we did not examine the
seroprevalence in children. As HEV infection is particularly
serious during pregnancy, our findings indicate that HEV
awareness needs to be increased. The distribution of IgG anti￾HEV seropositivity among blood donors according to age group
showed a significant increase for the age group .36 years, from
about 0% in 2011 to 26.4% in 2012. This absence found in the
first sampling period in 2011 was quite unusual but could be due
to sampling hazard or to HEV being introduced only recently.
The 2012 data were more in accordance with those obtained in
China by Li et al. in 2006 [61], showing that the seroprevalence of
HEV could be related to both age and the level of endemicity or
dietary exposure factors.
Recent studies in France indicate that HEV higher seropreva￾lence may be associated with dietary habits, and particularly with
consumption of pork or rabbit meat [14,16,20,49]. Despite
presence of rabbit breeding in rural areas of Bukina-Faso, little
is known about rabbit meat consumption in large cities. In
Ouagadougou, pork from locally-bred pigs is found in local fast￾foods (grilled pork vending outlets) and is widely consumed by the
population. As shown recently, the nature of processing affects the
prevalence of HEV in the pork production chain in Europe [62].
Thus, complementary studies addressing eating habits and the
serology of exposed population would be the logical continuation
of the present study. Several studies have shown that low
socioeconomic status, poor hygiene, lack of sewers, and un￾derdeveloped health care facilities constitute the main transmission
risk factors for HAV and HEV [32,63,64].
Conclusions
Despite being limited to a small subset of the Ouagadougou
population, our findings emphasize the need to establish a national
HAV and HEV surveillance program consisting. This program
should include additional sero-epidemiological surveys to track
changes in the epidemiology of these viruses, and especially factors
for their persistence, and the role of eating habits and food
processing methods in the spread of these infections. Data from
such a program could be used as the basis for designing an HAV
vaccination campaign and to enhance HEV surveillance.
In addition, HEV infection should not be considered rare and
its presence should be actively investigated, especially in pregnant
women given that HEV infection adds significant health risks to
pregnancy. Additional studies are needed to detail the incidence
and severity of this illness in pregnant women in Burkina Faso.
Finally, addressing the public health problems associated with
the enteric transmission of viral hepatitis in developing countries
will require implementing stronger measures to prevent fecal
contamination of food and water.
