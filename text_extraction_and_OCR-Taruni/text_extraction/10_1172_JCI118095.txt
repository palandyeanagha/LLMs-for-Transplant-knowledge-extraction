Abstract Introduction
Mononuclear cell infiltration and local cytokine elaboration
are hallmarks of inflammatory and immunologic heart dis￾eases. To test the hypothesis that cytokines can modulate
cardiac myocyte growth and phenotype, myocytes cultured
from neonatal rat hearts were exposed to IL-1.3, an in￾flammatory cytokine prevalent in myocardial inflammation.
IL-1p (2 ng/ml, 24 h) increased [3H]leucine incorporation
by 30±4% (P < 0.001, n = 29) and net cellular protein
content by 20±4% (P < 0.001, n = 27), but had no effect
on DNA synthesis. Northern hybridization showed that
IL-1j3 increased prepro-atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)
mRNA (5.8+1.5-fold, P < 0.01, n = 13) and (8-myosin heavy
chain ((3-MHC) mRNA (> 10-fold, n = 4), and decreased
mRNA levels for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase
(SERCA2) (-46±7%; P < 0.001; n = 11), calcium release
channel (CRC) (-65±11%, P < 0.001, n = 8) and voltage￾dependent calcium channel (VDCC) (-53±7%, P < 0.001,
n = 8). NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (1 mM), an inhibitor of
nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, did not inhibit the IL-1i-in￾duced protein synthesis or changes in mRNA levels. In ven￾tricular myocardium obtained from adult rats treated with
lipopolysaccharide (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally 18 h) to stim￾ulate systemic cytokine production, there were changes in
the mRNA levels for l-MHC (6±1-fold, P < 0.01, n = 4),
SERCA2 (-65±4%, P < 0.0001, n = 4), CRC (-67±5%,
P < 0.001, n = 4), and VDCC (-58±5%, P < 0.001; n = 4)
that were qualitatively similar to those observed in cultured
myocytes. Thus, IL-1i, acting via an NO-independent mech￾anism, caused myocyte hypertrophy associated with induc￾tion of fetal genes (ANF and ,f-MHC) and downregulation
of three important calcium regulatory genes (SERCA2,
CRC, and VDCC). IL-1iB may contribute to the abnormal
structural and functional alterations of cardiac myocytes in
conditions marked by mononuclear cell infiltration. (J. Clin.
Invest. 1995. 96:1093-1099.) Key words: cytokines * atrial

There is mononuclear cell infiltration of the myocardium with
local elaboration of inflammatory cytokines in a variety of car￾diovascular conditions such as myocarditis and transplant rejec￾tion (1). The effects of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac myo￾cyte growth and gene expression are not known. However, in
hematopoietic, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells,
inflammatory cytokines exert pleiotropic effects on cell growth,
differentiation, and gene expression (2-4), and many of the
signaling pathways activated by cytokines (5, 6) are known to
be involved in regulating growth and gene expression in cardiac
myocytes (7). In addition, cytokines induce nitric oxide (NO)'
production by upregulating expression of inducible nitric oxide
synthase in cardiac myocytes (8, 9) and could therefore act via
cGMP, which has been shown to modulate growth in vascular
smooth muscle cells (10). Thus, it is possible that cytokines
contribute to the structural and functional alterations of the
myocardium observed in states associated with myocardial in￾flammation.
We hypothesized that exposure to inflammatory cytokines
would cause myocyte hypertrophy associated with reexpression
of fetal genes and downregulation of adult muscle-specific
genes involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis. To test
this hypothesis, cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were
exposed to IL-1,3, an inflammatory cytokine prevalent in myo￾carditis (11, 12). We examined the effect of IL-1,3 on protein
synthesis, DNA synthesis, the mRNA levels for three fetal genes
(prepro-atrial natriuretic factor, ANF; ,3-myosin heavy chain,
f-MHC; and skeletal a-actin, a-SkA), and the mRNA levels
for three calcium regulatory genes (sarcoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA2; calcium release channel, CRC; and
voltage-dependent calcium channel, VDCC). The effect of NG￾monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric ox￾ide synthase (8), was determined to test the role of NO. To
address the pathophysiologic relevance of the in vitro obser￾vations, we also examined the phenotypic changes induced in
vivo in myocardium obtained from adult rats treated with LPS,
a potent stimulus for elaborating several inflammatory cyto￾kines (13).

2-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats killed by decapitation. Ventricular tissues
were incubated in 0. 1% trypsin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY)
in HBSS (Gibco) overnight at 40C. 3-4 digestions for 10 min each
were performed with 10 ml of 0.1% collagenase (Worthington Biochem￾ical Corp., Freehold, NJ) in HBSS. The dissociated cells were collected
by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 4 min (40C), pooled, and resuspended
in DME (Gibco) supplemented with 7% FBS (Gibco) and 5 ml penicil￾lin/streptomycin (PS) (Gibco). To selectively enrich for myocytes,
dissociated cells were preplated twice in T75 flasks (Corning Glass
Works, Corning, NY) for 75 min, during which period the nonmyocytes
attached readily to the bottom of the cultured dish. The resultant cell
suspension was cultured for 24 h in DME/FBS/PS with 0.1 mM Bromo￾deoxyuridine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) to prevent prolifera￾tion of nonmyocytes. The medium was changed to serum-free medium
containing insulin (5 pg/ml), transferrin (5 ,g/ml), and sodium selenite
(5 ng/ml) (ITS) (Sigma) for 24 h before treatment.
LPS treatment of adult rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing
200-250 grams were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Kings￾ton, NY). LPS from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma) (4 mg/kg) was
injected intraperitoneal 18 h before killing (16). The rats were anesthe￾tized with ether, and the heart was rapidly excised and prepared for
RNA isolation, as described later.
Incorporation of [3H] leucine. Cultured neonatal ventricular myo￾cytes, plated at 200-400 cells/mm2 (low density) and at 1,000 cells/
mm2 (high density) in 24-well plates were treated with 0.02-4 ng/ml
IL-1:6 (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and coincubated with
2 ACi/ml [3H]leucine (Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA) for 24 h, unless
otherwise stated. Cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with
5% TCA at 4°C for 30 min to precipitate protein. The precipitates were
washed twice with ice-cold water and resuspended in 0.4 M NaOH.
Aliquots were counted by a scintillation counter. To examine the effect
of IL-l1, on protein degradation, cells were labeled to isotopic equilib￾rium by incubating for 48 h with [3H]leucine. Cells were then washed
to remove extracellular [3H] leucine before treatment with IL-1,63 for an
additional 24 h. The labeled cells were harvested as described earlier.
Incorporation of [3H] thymidine. After culturing for 24 h in serum￾free medium, neonatal cells in 24-well plates (200-400 cells/mm2)
were treated with IL-/I# for 24 h. After 18 h, [3H]thymidine (2 pCi/
ml) (Dupont-NEN) was added for the last 6 h before harvest, as
described earlier.
Protein content. Net protein synthesis was measured in neonatal
myocytes plated at 200-400 cells/mm2 in 6-well plates (control cells
and cells treated with 2 ng/ml IL-1,B for 24 h). Each well was rinsed
two times with PBS and scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer (1%
Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM EGTA, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5% NP-40).
Protein content was measured by Bradford assay (17).
Beating rate. The spontaneous beating was examined in control
cells and cells incubated with 2 ng/ml IL-1I3 for 24 h. Cells plated at
a density of 1,000 cells/mm2 were maintained in serum-free DME/ITS/
PS for 24 h before addition of the IL-iI. Beating rate (expressed as
beats per min) was measured by counting the number of beats in 15 s
using the 40x objective on a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Inc.,
Instr. Group, Melville, NY).
Assessing the nitric oxide pathway. The role of nitric oxide in protein
synthesis and gene regulation was assessed using L-NMMA (1 mM),
an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were
prepared as described earlier. After 1 d of culture in a serum-free media,
cells were incubated for 4 h in L-arginine-depleted culture medium
(MEM, Select Amine; GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), containing
either 1 mM L-arginine (for control cells) or 1 mM L-NMMA (Calbio￾chem Corp., La Jolla, CA), before IL-1,8 (2 ng/ml, 24 h) exposure.
Cells were used for [3H] leucine incorporation experiments and Northern
hybridizations (described later).
To confirm that L-NMMA inhibited NO production, cGMP levels
were used as markers of IL-iI -induced NO synthesis. Myocyte cGMP
content was measured using a standard radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedi￾cal Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) (18). Cells were treated as
described previously. 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (1 mM) (Sigma)
was added to cell culture 1 h before assay termination with 0.1 M
hydrochloric acid. cGMP was determined by RIA and expressed as
picomoles per milligram of protein.
RNA preparation and Northern hybridization of neonatal myocytes.
Neonatal ventricular myocytes, plated in 100-mm cultured plates at high
density (1,000 cells/mm2) unless specified otherwise, were treated with
IL-i/I for 21-27 h. Cells were resuspended in denaturing solution (4
M guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mM Na citrate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine,
0.1 M /I-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). Total RNA was isolated by a modi￾fication of technique by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19) and quantitated
by spectrophotometry. RNA was denatured with formaldehyde and for￾mamide, and separated by size electrophoresis on a 1.3% agarose/4%
formaldehyde gel ( 15 gg total RNA per lane). RNA was transferred to
nylon membranes (Genescreen Plus; DuPont-NEN) by capillary trans￾fer and crosslinked by UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

of the human a-SkA 3 '-untranslated region pHMaA-3 'UT-Fnu (cour￾tesy of Dr. James L. Lessard, Harvard Medical School) were labeled
with [32P]dCTP (Dupont) to a specific activity of 1-2 x 106 cpm/ng
cDNA by the random hexamer priming method, and hybridized to nylon
blots for 18-24 h at 42°C, as previously described (20). Blots hybrid￾ized with prepro-ANF and SERCA2 cDNA were washed twice (15 min,
room temperature [RT]) with 2 X SSC (1 X SSC, 150 mM NaCl, 15
mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0)/0.1% SDS and twice (15 min, 60°C)
with 0.2 x SSC/0.1% SDS. Blots hybridized with a-SkA cDNA were
washed twice (15 min, RT) with 4 x SSC/0.1% SDS and twice (10
min, 42°C) with 4 x SSC/0.1% SDS. Blots hybridized to CRC and
VDCC were washed twice (15 min, RT) with 2 x SSC/0.1% SDS
and once (5-20 min, 45°C) with 0.5 x SSC/0.1% SDS. A synthetic
oligonucleotide probe 20 bases in length was constructed complemen￾tary to the 3' untranslated region of the rat /I-MHC mRNA (GGTCTC￾AGGGCTTCACAGGC) (21). The probe was labeled with [32P]ATP
(Dupont-NEN) at the 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase to a spe￾cific activity of 2 X 107 cpm/ug. Blots hybridized with the /I-MHC
oligonucleotide probe were washed twice (15 min, RT) with 4 x SSC/
0.1% SDS and twice (10 min, 42°C) with 4 x SSC/0.1% SDS. The
relative amount of mRNA per lane was determined by exposing the
washed blots to Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY)
with an intensifying screen at -70°C, and measuring the density of the
exposed band with a laser densitometer (Ultrascan 2202; LKB, Swe￾den). The sizes of the hybridized messages were estimated using the
18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands as standards.
All blots were reprobed with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide comple￾mentary to 18S ribosomal RNA, washed, and autoradiographed as pre￾viously described (20). Levels of mRNA reported here are normalized
to the level of 18S rRNA to correct for potential differences in the
amount of RNA loaded and transferred.
RNA preparation from LPS-treated animals. Left ventricular myo￾cardium from LPS-treated animals was immersed in denaturing solution
(4 M guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mM Na citrate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine,
0.1 M /I-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and immediately homogenized at
maximum speed (10 s, x2) with a polytron (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH).
Total RNA was isolated by a modification of Chomczynski and Sacchi's
technique (19). RNA was denatured with formaldehyde and formamide
and separated by size electrophoresis on 1.3% agarose/4% formalde￾hyde gel (30 gg total RNA/lane). Filters were hybridized to the various
probes and washed as described previously.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean±SEM. Statis￾tical analysis was performed using the Student's t test or Student￾Newman Keuls's test with one-way analysis of variance, as appropriate.
A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Effect of IL-1,B on [HI] leucine uptake and protein content. In
neonatal cardiac myocytes cultured at low density, exposure to
L-1/P (2 ng/ml) caused a time-dependent increase in [3H]-
leucine incorporation (17±6, 40±6, and 59±12% at 24, 48,
and 72 h, respectively; P < 0.01 at each time point, n = 5; Fig.
1 A), indicating that IL-1/3 increases [3H] leucine incorporation
into protein. In 29 experiments, the mean increase in [3H]-
leucine uptake over control at 24 h was 30±4% (P < 0.001).
In myocytes plated at high density, IL-1/p exposure for 24 h
caused a similar 30±10% increase in [3H]leucine uptake (P
< 0.02, n = 8). This effect of IL-1P was concentration depen￾dent, with a threshold of - 0.02 ng/ml, and a plateau between
1 and 4 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B).
Compared with control, 1L-1,/ (2 ng/ml, 24 h) caused a

< 0.02, n = 16), indicating that the increased [3H] leucine
incorporation is associated with an increase in net protein and
RNA synthesis.
Effect of IL-1/3 on [3H]thymidine uptake. IL-1/3 had no
effect on [3H]thymidine uptake over 24 h (4,910±812 vs.
5,146±760 dpm; P = NS, n = 10; Fig. 2 B). These findings
indicate that IL-1P causes myocyte hypertrophy in the absence
of hyperplasia, an effect similar to that caused by several hyper￾trophic stimuli, including norepinephrine, angiotensin, endo￾thelin, some peptide growth factors (e.g., basic fibroblast
growth factor), and stretch (22-26).
Effect of IL-1/3 on release of [3H]leucine. IL-1/3 had no
effect on the rate of [3H ] leucine release from cells labeled to
isotopic equilibrium, suggesting that protein degradation is not
accelerated by 11-1,/ exposure (Fig. 1 C). Thus, IL-1,3 does
not affect the rate of protein catabolism.
Effect of IL-1P on beating rate. In high density cultures,
control myocytes formed a syncytium with a beating rate of
138±7 bpm. In cells treated with IL-1/3 (2 ng/ml) for 24 h,
the beating rate was unchanged at 145 ±5 bpm (P = NS, n
- 15).
Effect of nitric oxide on IL-i,/-induced myocyte hypertro￾phy. Inflammatory cytokines may attenuate the biochemical and
physiologic responses of the myocyte to f-adrenergic stimula￾tion via an NO-mediated mechanism (8). We therefore exam￾ined the role of NO in mediating IL-1,6-induced myocyte hy￾pertrophy. L-NMMA, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, did
not inhibit IL-1,6-induced [3H] leucine incorporation. In these
experiments, IL-1/3 caused a 25±9% increase in [3H]leucine
uptake at 24 h (P = 0.02, n = 8; Fig. 3 A), and L-NMMA alone
had no effect on [3H] leucine incorporation. The magnitude of
IL-13-induced [3H] leucine incorporation in the presence of L￾NMMA (24+7%) was no different from that caused by IL-1/3
alone (P = NS vs. IL-1p, n = 8; Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the
hypertrophic effect of IL-1,8 does not depend on NO synthesis.
To confirm that L-NMMA inhibited NO production in these
experiments, cGMP levels were measured as a marker of IL￾1/3-induced NO synthesis. IL-1,/ increased cGMP levels ap￾IL-J,/ Modulates Myocyte Growth and Phenotype 1095

NO synthesis was inhibited by our protocol.
Induction ofafetal gene program in association with hyper￾trophy. Several hypertrophic stimuli have been shown to induce
a fetal gene program associated with the repression of adult
muscle-specific gene expression (7, 25, 26). In high density
cultures of neonatal rat myocytes exposed to IL-1if (2 ng/ml,
24 h), the level of ANF mRNA was increased by 5.8±1.5-fold
(P < 0.01, n = 13; Figs. 4 A and 5 A). f)-MHC mRNA was
not detectable or only faintly visible in control myocytes, but
was expressed at high levels in IL-li/-treated myocytes (esti￾mated; > 10-fold induction; n = 4; Figs. 4 A and 5 A). Exposure
to IL-i/i for 24 h had no effect on the level of a-SkA mRNA
(1.1±0.1-fold; P = NS, n = 11; Figs. 4 A and 5 A). In the
presence of L-NMMA, the induction of ANF mRNA (9.4+6-
fold; P < 0.01, n = 4; Fig. 6) and P-MHC mRNA (estimated;
> 10-fold induction; n = 2) was not attenuated compared with
the effect of IL-1,i alone, suggesting that NO does not mediate
the induction of the fetal gene program by IL-if). In low density
(200-400 cells/mm2) cultures of neonatal rat myocytes, IL-1i/
for 24 h had an effect on ANF mRNA levels (7.1±1.7-fold
induction; P < 0.01, n = 6) that was qualitatively similar to
that seen in high density cultures.
Regulation of major calcium regulatory genes. In parallel
studies, we examined the regulation of mRNA levels for three
proteins involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis in cardiac
myocytes. In high density cultures of neonatal rat myocytes
exposed to IL-1if for 24 h, there were decreases in the mRNA
levels for SERCA2 (-46±7%; P < 0.001, n = 1), CRC
(-65±11%; P < 0.001, n = 8), and VDCC (-53±7%; P

P < 0.01, n = 3) were not reduced, suggesting that NO synthe￾sis is not involved in this action of IL-1p.
Effect of LPS on myocardial gene expression in vivo. The
intraperitoneal administration of LPS has been shown to induce
expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-i/i (27).
In left ventricular myocardium obtained from rats treated with
intraperitoneal LPS (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 18 h), there
was a 2.0_0.7-fold (P = NS, n = 4; data not shown) induction
of prepro-ANF mRNA and a 6.4_0.8-fold (P < 0.01, n = 4;
Fig. 7) induction of /-MHC mRNA. These changes in fetal
gene expression were associated with a 65±4% decrease in
SERCA2 mRNA, a 67±5% decrease in CRC mRNA, and a
58±5% decrease in VDCC mRNA (P < 0.001, n = 4; Fig. 7).
These effects are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the
observations in cultured myocytes.
Discussion
The major new finding of this study is that IL-1i/, a cytokine
prominent in inflammatory conditions of the heart, causes hy￾pertrophy of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in vitro. This growth
effect is associated with reexpression of fetal genes characteris￾tic of hypertrophy (prepro-ANF and ,/-MHC) and downregula￾tion of mRNA for three genes central to calcium homeostasis
in cardiac myocytes (SERCA2, CRC, and VDCC). Cultured

In this system, adrenergic stimulation, angiotensin, endothelin,
and peptide growth factors cause myocyte hypertrophy without
hyperplasia (22-26). We found that IL-1,3 likewise increased
net protein and RNA content in the absence of DNA synthesis.
[3H]Leucine release studies also showed that 1L-1,1-induced
hypertrophy was not associated with increased protein break￾down.
Several observations suggest that cardiac hypertrophy is as￾sociated with a characteristic pattern of gene expression (7,

26). During hypertrophy, ventricular myocytes reexpress ANF,
a feature lost in the normal postnatal ventricle. In addition, there
is a switch at the mRNA level in the contractile protein isoforms
from a-MHC to ,8-MHC (7). In cultured neonatal cells exposed
to IL-1,3 for 24 h, we found induction of prepro-ANF and 63-
MHC, but not a-SkA. Although the failure of IL-113 to induce
a-SkA mRNA appears to distinguish it from several other ago￾nists that induce myocyte hypertrophy, at least one other factor
(acidic fibroblast growth factor) causes reciprocal changes in
the levels of P-MHC (increased) and a-SkA (decreased)
mRNA (25, 28).
Several proteins, including SERCA2, CRC, and VDCC,
play a central role in regulating systolic and diastolic calcium
levels in myocytes (29). We found a downregulation of mRNA
expression for all three calcium regulatory genes in response to
IL-1,3 in vitro and to LPS in vivo. Although it is reasonable to
assume that decreased mRNA expression will ultimately result
in decreased levels of these proteins, this remains to be deter￾mined. Likewise, further work is required to determine whether
the observed changes in steady state mRNA levels are due to
transcriptional versus posttranscriptional mechanisms.
SERCA2 mRNA has reportedly been reduced in pressure
overload hypertrophy (30) and end-stage heart failure (31, 32).
However, other studies have not found a decrease in SERCA2
mRNA in hypertrophy (33) or a decrease in the SERCA2 pro￾tein level in failing human myocardium (34). Relatively less
is known about the expression of CRC and VDCC in hypertro￾phied or failing myocardium. CRC mRNA levels have been
found to be decreased in myocardium obtained from patients
with ischemic, but not idiopathic, dilated cardiomyopathy (35).
VDCC mRNA and protein levels have been reported to be
decreased in myocardium from patients with both ischemic and
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (36). Other investigators
have shown that acute exposure of myocytes to cytokines atten￾uates intracellular calcium transients via an NO-independent
mechanism (37). Our data suggest that tonic exposure to in￾flammatory cytokines could also affect calcium homeostasis
and excitation-contraction coupling by downregulating the ex￾pression of calcium regulatory genes.
Roberts et al. (9, 38) have shown in neonatal rat cardiac
myocytes that a 24-h exposure to IL-I,8 decreases the spontane￾ous beating rate. This effect is mediated by nitric oxide and
requires the presence of either a fibroblast matrix or fibroblasts.
Balligand et al. (8) have also implicated nitric oxide in mediat￾ing the negative inotropic effect of inflammatory cytokines on
the cultured cardiac myocytes. In our studies, L-NMMA did
not inhibit the hypertrophic response or the changes in gene
expression, suggesting that in contrast to the effects of IL- If
on beating rate and contractility, these effects of IL-1p8 are not

dependent on nitric oxide synthesis. We cannot exclude the
possibility that NO is involved in regulating other genes by IL￾1,6. IL-1I3 treatment for 24 h did not affect the spontaneous
beating rate, presumably because our cells were grown on plas￾tic rather than a fibroblast matrix, which appears to be necessary
for this effect to occur (9, 38).
Roberts et al. (9, 38) have further shown that TGF-/31 can
antagonize the ability of IL-1,8 to reduce beating rate in neonatal
rat cardiac myocytes. We have reported that two hypertrophic
stimuli, norepinephrine and pressure overload, induce the ex￾pression of TGF-P/ in cardiac myocytes (15), and we have
observed that IL-1,6, likewise, induces TGF-P,3 mRNA expres￾sion in cultured neonatal myocytes (our unpublished observa￾tions). The role of TGF-f31 in modulating the effects of IL-l,6
on myocyte growth and phenotype is unclear. However, we
have found that under the conditions of these experiments, the
TGF-/31 secreted by cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes in re￾sponse to norepinephrine is inactive (15).
The mechanism by which IL-1,6 modulates growth and phe￾notype remains to be elucidated. Preliminary evidence suggests
that protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and mitogen-activated
protein kinase may be involved (39). An IL-1,/-mediated
change in beating rate does not appear to contribute, because
under the conditions of these experiments (i.e., in the absence
of a fibroblast matrix), this effect would not be expected (38)
and was not observed. The observation that TGF-,61 is induced
by IL-1p further raises the possibility of an autocrine and/
or paracrine mechanism. It is noteworthy that in a myocyte￾nonmyocyte coculture system, IL-la inhibited protein and
mRNA synthesis, and this effect was due to the paracrine action
of a soluble factor made by the nonmyocytes (40).
Because the myocyte cultures used in this study contain a
small percentage of nonmyocytes (primarily fibroblasts), we
cannot exclude the possibility that such cells are involved in
mediating the observed effects of IL-l/3 (41). However, two
observations argue against this possibility. First, in our cultures,
IL-1I3 did not decrease beating rate, an effect Roberts et al.
(38) have shown requires the presence of fibroblasts. Second,
we found that IL-1/3 caused similar increases in [3H] leucine
uptake and ANF mRNA induction in myocytes cultured at high
and low densities, suggesting that cell density is not a critical
determinant of these aspects of the growth response to IL-1,6.
We cannot exclude an effect of cell density on the expression
of other genes that were not examined in this study.
Since these experiments were performed in neonatal cells,
it cannot be assumed that the observed effects of IL-l1,6 are
relevant to adult myocytes. However, a pattern of gene expres￾sion similar to that observed in cultured myocytes was induced
in the ventricular myocardium of adult rats treated with LPS.
LPS is a known potent stimulus for a variety of inflammatory
cytokines (13). Several cytokines may be induced by LPS;
therefore, we cannot implicate IL-I1/3 as the major or sole ef￾fector in this model, nor can we exclude the role of hormonal
factors (e.g., systemic catecholamines) that might be stimu￾lated. Nevertheless, these in vivo observations are consistent
with the in vitro data and support the general thesis that cyto￾kines can modulate myocardial phenotype.
These findings provide a mechanism by which inflammatory
cytokines could affect the structure and function of the myocar￾dium. Inflammatory cytokines may be present in the myocar￾dium during inflammatory states (e.g., acute myocarditis) and
chronic immunologic stimulation (e.g., subacute myocarditis,
transplant rejection, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy).
Recently, it has been proposed that inflammatory cytokines
might be present in failing myocardium in the absence of a
primary inflammatory process (42). In human myocarditis and
transplant rejection, the extent of myocyte necrosis often corre￾lates poorly with the extent of myocardial dysfunction (43, 44),
consistent with the thesis that soluble inflammatory mediators
released during the inflammatory process (e.g., LL-13) might
mediate effects on myocardial structure and function. A clinical
implication of our findings is that inhibitors of inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-Ip receptor antagonists, might prove use￾ful in ameliorating the structural and functional consequences
of inflammatory and/or immunologically mediated myocardial
processes.
