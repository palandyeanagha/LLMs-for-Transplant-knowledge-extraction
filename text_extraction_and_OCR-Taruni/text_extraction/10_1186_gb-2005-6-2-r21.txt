Abstract
We describe an ontology for cell types that covers the prokaryotic, fungal, animal and plant worlds.
It includes over 680 cell types. These cell types are classified under several generic categories and
are organized as a directed acyclic graph. The ontology is available in the formats adopted by the
Open Biological Ontologies umbrella and is designed to be used in the context of model organism
genome and other biological databases. The ontology is freely available at http://
obo.sourceforge.net/ and can be viewed using standard ontology visualization tools such as OBO￾Edit and COBrA.
Background
One of the most challenging problems now facing the model
organism databases is the formal description of phenotypic
data. While some databases, for example those for mouse
(Mus musculus) [1], corn (Zea mays) [2] and fruit fly (Dro￾sophila melanogaster) [3], include a rich heritage of data
describing the phenotypes of mutants, and some progress is
being made to bring these data into a well structured comput￾able representation [3-5], the annotation of these phenotypes
is hampered by a lack of structured information describing a
variety of other biological objects, including cell types. A
structured vocabulary of cell types is also required by data￾bases for the description of other biological objects, such as
gene-expression data. In addition, using the same concepts
for the description of these data in all of these databases
would facilitate interoperability among them.
To address these needs, we have developed an ontology that
describes the cell types of the major model organisms, both
animal and plant. Its use will allow a biologist to query a sin￾gle database with such questions as: list all of the cell types in
mouse that express the Notch gene and all of the cell types in
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans that express the
closest homolog of this gene; list all of the genes in mouse, rat,
human and zebrafish that are expressed in the cell type
Schwann_cell; CL:0000218; list all of the genes in D. mela￾nogaster and C. elegans that have a mutant phenotype in the
cell types that develop from the cell type myoblast;
CL:0000056. The use of the cell ontology will thereby pro￾mote the de facto integration of data from diverse databases.
Since the development of the Gene Ontology (GO) for the
annotation of attributes of gene products [6], many ontolo￾gies have been developed in the model organism informatics
community. Several of these are available, in a choice of com￾mon formats, from the Open Biological Ontologies (OBO) site
[7]. They include comprehensive developmental and anatom￾ical ontologies for many model organisms (for example,
mouse, Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana and C. elegans),
and ontologies for mouse pathology and human disease.

R21.2 Genome Biology 2005, Volume 6, Issue 2, Article R21 Bard et al. http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R21
Genome Biology 2005, 6:R21
There are several other ontologies that include cell types such
as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) [8],
the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) [9], the anatomy
ontologies used in model organism databases at the OBO site
[7], vocabularies used by the resources that hold cell lines
such as the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC) or the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) [10,11], and
others [12,13]. Our approach for handling cell types differs
from that adopted by these resources. First, SNOMED, FMA
and the species-specific anatomy ontologies explicitly assume
that the cell types they include are associated with one partic￾ular organism. Their identifiers cannot therefore be used to
annotate cell types from other organisms, even if these cell
types are essentially identical to those in the organism-spe￾cific ontologies. Second, these resources, together with those
that hold cell lines (for example, ECACC and ATCC), tend to
define cell types as constituents of tissues rather than provide
phenotypic information about their attributes - the knowl￾edge that they encapsulate is severely limited. Third, some
ontologies do not have publicly available identifiers for each
term; hence they cannot be used for general annotation
[10,11]. The Plant Ontology [14] provides a cell type node that
shares some of the organizing principles of our cell ontology,
but it is limited to those cell types found in plants. For all
these reasons, we set out to produce an organism-independ￾ent ontology of cell types based on their properties (such as
functional, histological and lineage classes) and report here
the availability on the Open Biological Ontologies site [7] of
this ontology, which incorporates the cell types possessed by
a broad range of phyla and is defined by a rich set of criteria.
Results
The ontology
The first design decision was whether we should attempt to
integrate cell types from all phyla within a single ontology or
build independent ontologies for different taxonomic groups.
The former has the great advantage of facilitating de facto
integration of data from diverse databases, as described
above. This approach does, however, pose conceptual prob￾lems: for example, are a mammalian 'muscle_cell' and a nem￾atode 'muscle_cell' homologous? In this particular example
we have little doubt that the answer is 'yes'; both of these cell
types are evolutionary descendants of the first metazoan's
'muscle_cell'. In other cases, however, matters are not quite
as straightforward, a plant 'hair_cell', a 'hair_cell' of the
mammalian cochlea and an insect 'hair_cell' are probably not
homologous, despite some similarities in their functions and
genes expressed within them [15]. Despite these problems in
building an 'integrated' cell-type ontology, the advantages,
were we to succeed, outweigh them, and we have therefore
taken this approach to develop a single ontology that inte￾grates cell types from different phyla.
The ontology consists of concepts or terms (nodes) that are
linked by two types of relationships (edges). This means that
the ontology appears as a complex hierarchy (technically
known as a directed acyclic graph, or DAG) where a given
term (or concept) may not only have several children, but also
several parents. The parent and child terms are connected to
each other by is_a and develops_from relationships. The
former is a subsumption relationship, in which the child term
is a more restrictive concept than its parent (thus chondro￾cyte is_a mesenchyme_cell). The latter is used to code devel￾opmental lineage relationships between concepts, for
example that a hepatocyte develops_from a
mesenchymal_cell. The is_a relationship implies inherit￾ance, so that any properties of the parent concept are inher￾ited by its children; the develops_from concept carries no
inheritance implications.
The rules for building the ontology are the same as those
defined by the GO Consortium. That is, each concept in the
Cell Ontology has an identifier with the syntax CL:nnnnnnn,
where nnnnnnn is a unique integer, and CL identifies the Cell
Ontology, (concepts should always be cited with their full
identifier when being used in the context of a database). In
addition, if there are precisely equivalent terms in other data￾bases, for example in the Fungal Anatomy [16], Arabidopsis
[17], Plant Ontology [14] or FlyBase databases [3], then the
unique identifiers from these databases are included in the
Cell Ontology. Most concepts in the Cell Ontology are pro￾vided with free-text definitions and may have one or more
synonyms. Within the context of this ontology, synonyms are
precise; a concept and its synonym can be exchanged without
changing the concept's meaning. We use the same stratagem
as does the GO when we have concepts that are lexically iden￾tical but have different meanings in different communities
[18]. Thus, it is far from obvious that vertebrate and inverte￾brate pigment cells are homologous and these concepts are
therefore described as pigment_cell_(sensu_Vertebrata)
and pigment_cell_(sensu_Nematoda_and_Protostoma,
respectively.
The two top-level nodes of the Cell Ontology are cell_in_vivo
and experimentally_modified_cell. The former includes cell
types that occur in nature, the latter those that are experi￾mentally derived, including cell lines and such constructs as
protoplasts. Experimentally derived cells are under-repre￾sented in the current version of the ontology. Naturally occur￾ring cells are classified both by organism-independent
categories and by organism (animal cells, plant cells, prokary￾otic cells). The organism-independent classification of cells
follows several different criteria that include: 'function' (for
example, electrically_excitable_cell, secretory_cell,
photosynthetic_cell), histology (for example, epthelial_cell,
mesenchyme_cell), lineage (for example, ectodermal_cell,
endodermal_cell) and ploidy (for example, haploid_cell,
polyploid_cell). The present version of the Cell Ontology has
an average 'depth' of about 10 nodes.

The richness of the ontology can be illustrated by example
(Figure 1). Kupffer cells are specialized vertebrate macro￾phages of the reticuloendothelial system. They function to fil￾ter small foreign particles (including bacteria) and old
reticulocytes from the blood. In the Cell Ontology they are to
be found by their function (they are a type of defensive_cell),
by their lineage (they are derived from a mesodermal_cell
derived from a hematopoietic_stem_cell, itself a type of
stem_cell), by their morphology (they are a type of
circulating_cell) and by their organism (they are a type of
animal_cell).
Discussion
Ontologies in bioinformatics are intended to capture and for￾malize a domain of knowledge, and the ontology reported
here attempts to do this within the domain of cell types. It is
designed to be useful in the sense that a researcher should be
able to find, in a rapid and intuitive way, any cell type in any
of the major model organisms and, having found it, learn a
considerable amount about that cell type and its relationships
to other biological objects.
A core feature of the ontology, and one that differentiates it
from other resources that contain cell types such as SNOMED
and the FMA [8,9], and the Drosophila and Arabidopsis
ontologies [3,17], is that the cell ontology explicitly sets out to
include cell types from all the major model organisms within
a common framework. In addition, it also seeks to incorpo￾rate a great deal of phenotypic information about these cell
types and is thus far more comprehensive in its cellular detail
than these other resources. The intention is that the new cell￾A screenshot of the cell ontology, as seen Figure 1 within the OBO-Edit program, displaying all the information associated with the term hepatocyte

type ontology should provide organism-independent knowl￾edge as well as cell-type unique identifiers (ID) that can be
incorporated into any database holding cell-type-associated
knowledge. The formalized structure of the ontology, together
with its set of unique IDs, will allow curators to incorporate
cell-type data into their databases, integrate the data with the
knowledge encapsulated in the ontology, and use the IDs to
interoperate with other databases. While we expect such bio￾informatics applications to be its immediate use, we hope
that, in the longer term, all biologists will find the ontology
useful.
The expected short-term use of the ontology will thus be in
cataloguing phenotypes and gene expression patterns.
Indeed, it is quite surprising that those who work with model
organisms still lack the bioinformatics resources needed to
catalogue, archive and access the details of the phenotypes
emerging from mutant screens and natural variations. A
robust representation of normal and mutant phenotypes in
all of the model organisms will require ontologies for a wide
range of macroscopic properties (pathology, anatomy, abnor￾mal quantifiers, and so on) and we view the cell ontology as a
component of this programme that should be useful in cata￾loguing phenotypes (and other attributes) associated with cell
types.
In the long term we expect that molecular biology and biolog￾ical databases will move beyond being gene-centric and that
biological mechanisms will be studied at a more integrated
level. Cells are the biological units with which tissues and
organs and organ systems are built. A rich and explicit
description of cell types across phyla that are adapted by bio￾logical databases will help facilitate this transition.
Finally, it should be pointed out that, like many such
resources, this ontology is not complete: although it contains
all the common cell types, there will certainly be some that
have been omitted. Most importantly, although many of the
cell types are fully described by function, morphology, organ￾ism, and so on, others are inadequately described and more
relationships need to be made. A particular weakness is the
fact that the category identified as
experimentally_modified_cell has yet to be populated, and
doing this will involve consideration of the various cell lines
held in the major collections. As with other community
resources, community input is essential for the development
and maintenance of the Cell Ontology; biologists with com￾ments and additions are therefore welcome to contribute to
the ontology and should contact the curator ashburner
@ebi.ac.uk.
Materials and methods
The ontology includes the major cell types from the major
model organisms (for example, human, mouse, Drosophila,
Caenorhabditis, zebrafish, Dictyostelium discoideum, Arabi￾dopsis, fungi and prokaryotes). These cell types have been
collated from our own knowledge, from major textbooks (for
example [20-22]), from the embryo and anatomy ontologies
available on the OBO site [7], and from colleagues (who are
thanked in the acknowledgements). The ontology currently
holds some 680 cell types, together with their synonyms and,
in most cases, text definitions.
The ontology was constructed using the open source Java tool
OBO-Edit (previously known as DAG-Edit) [23], which is
convenient for building ontologies that are consistent with
the GO formalism. The resulting ontology is available in both
the GO 'flat-file' format [24] and the newly defined 'OBO for￾mat' [25], and can easily be viewed using the OBO-Edit or the
COBrA open source Java tool [26].
Availability
The Cell Ontology is available from the OBO site [19]. Follow￾ing the cell.obo link will take the user to a page in which the
current version of the Ontology, and archived older versions,
can be viewed (view) or downloaded (download). Differences
between the current and previous version can be seen by fol￾lowing the Diff to link.
