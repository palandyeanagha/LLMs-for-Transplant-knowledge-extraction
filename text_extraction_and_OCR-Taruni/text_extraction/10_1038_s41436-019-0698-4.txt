Purpose: Pathogenic variants in neuroblastoma-amplified sequence
(NBAS) cause an autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of
symptoms affecting liver, skeletal system, and brain, among others.
There is a continuously growing number of patients but a lack of
systematic and quantitative analysis.
Methods: Individuals with biallelic variants in NBAS were recruited
within an international, multicenter study, including novel and
previously published patients. Clinical variables were analyzed with
log-linear models and visualized by mosaic plots; facial profiles were
investigated via DeepGestalt. The structure of the NBAS protein was
predicted using computational methods.
Results: One hundred ten individuals from 97 families with biallelic
pathogenic NBAS variants were identified, including 26 novel
patients with 19 previously unreported variants, giving a total
number of 86 variants. Protein modeling redefined the β-propeller
domain of NBAS. Based on the localization of missense variants and
in-frame deletions, three clinical subgroups arise that differ
significantly regarding main clinical features and are directly related
to the affected region of the NBAS protein: β-propeller (combined
phenotype), Sec39 (infantile liver failure syndrome type 2/ILFS2),
and C-terminal (short stature, optic atrophy, and Pelger–Huët
anomaly/SOPH).
Conclusion: We define clinical subgroups of NBAS-associated
disease that can guide patient management and point to domain￾specific functions of NBAS.

INTRODUCTION
In 2010, NBAS (neuroblastoma-amplified sequence, MIM
608025)–associated disease was described in Yakuts, an
isolated population living in the far east of the Russian
Federation, carrying a homozygous missense variant in NBAS
(c.[5741G>A]; resulting in p.[Arg1914His]). Their clinical
phenotype comprised short stature with facial dysmorphism,
optic atrophy, and Pelger–Huët anomaly, leading to the
coining of the term SOPH syndrome (MIM 614800).1 In 2015,
the discovery of biallelic NBAS variants in patients with
recurrent acute liver failure (RALF) linked NBAS to hepatic
disease and revealed the occurrence of pathogenic NBAS
variants in the Caucasian and US populations.2 As extra￾hepatic findings such as facial abnormalities or short stature
were also present in some of these patients with a predominant
hepatic phenotype, we hypothesized that NBAS variants may
cause a disease spectrum between the phenotypic features of
SOPH syndrome and isolated RALF (infantile liver failure
syndrome type 2/ILFS2, MIM 616483).3,4
Within just the next three years, 44 patients from 35
families with NBAS-associated disease were published or
reported at conferences.4–36 The growing number of known

affected individuals continuously expanded the phenotypic
spectrum. The organ systems mainly involved were liver,
skeletal systems including growth, the nervous system
including the eye, the integument, the immune system, and
the musculature. Additionally, facial dysmorphism was also
prevalent. Given the fact that levels of the NBAS protein were
reduced in patients’ fibroblasts (refs. 2,10, authors’ unpub￾lished data), NBAS-associated disease is often termed as
NBAS deficiency.
The wide spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with
NBAS variants points to crucial functions of the NBAS
protein in biology. The protein functions as a component of
an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethering complex involved in
the retrograde Golgi–ER transport.2,3,37 New data suggest an
additional role of NBAS at the ER exit site for the formation
of large transport vesicles for bulky cargo (e.g., collagen) in
the secretory pathway.38 Recently, variants in RINT1, which
encodes for a direct interaction partner of NBAS in the same
tethering complex, were shown to cause human disease with a
striking clinical overlap to NBAS deficiency.39 This strongly
supports the hypothesis that dysfunction of the tethering
complex is causative for at least a part of the phenotypic
spectrum of NBAS-associated disease. Moreover, the dis￾covery of cholestasis, acute liver failure, and neurodegenera￾tion (CALFAN) syndrome due to variants in SCYL1, another
disorder of intracellular trafficking with clinical and func￾tional overlap to NBAS, enforces the link between disturbed
Golgi–ER transport and human disease.40 Apart from its role
in intracellular transport, NBAS was identified to be a
mediator of nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA)
decay (NMD), especially modulating genes associated with
protein trafficking and ER-coupled protein modifications,41
but the role of altered NMD in NBAS deficiency remains to be
elucidated.
Exploring clinical disease patterns associated with NBAS
variants and their correlation to genotypes provides great
chances to improve our understanding of the function of
NBAS. It is the nature of case reports and case series that
there is a lack of systematic analysis and to date, there is no
unified approach for the attribution of patients to the
associated clinical syndromes or the nomenclature of these.
In this study, we systematically and quantitatively analyze the
genotype and clinical phenotype of all patients with
pathogenic NBAS variants currently known to us, including
all previously reported cases and 26 novel patients from 23
families with 19 novel variants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design, recruitment of patients, data acquisition, and
definition of variables
Individuals were recruited within an international, multi￾center study. Inclusion criteria were rare biallelic variants
in NBAS (NM_015909.3) classified as pathogenic or likely
pathogenic according to the American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for the inter￾pretation of sequence variants and/or NBAS protein or RNA
analysis in fibroblasts.42 Patients were excluded from the
quantitative analysis of the clinical phenotype, if they fulfilled
one of the following criteria: (1) patients aged less than
12 months at last assessment (to reduce the effect of low age
on a possibly evolving phenotype), (2) presymptomatic
diagnosis due to family screening, (3) presence of severe
comorbidities unrelated to NBAS variants, and (4) lack of
individualized clinical data.
Recruitment was via one of the following options: (1)
individuals diagnosed via exome sequencing at the Institute of
Human Genetics of the Technical University of Munich or
another collaborative center, (2) individuals followed by one
of the coauthors, or (3) previously published patients.
For options 1 and 2, clinical data were retrieved via case
report forms and stored within a disease-specific database
located at the Center for Child and Adolescent Medicine of
the University Hospital Heidelberg. This included current
follow-up visits of previously reported individuals.3,4 If
available and consented by the parents, portrait photos of
the patients were collected. In case of previously published
patients reported by other groups, data were obtained from
these publications; in case of missing data for the quantitative
analysis, authors were contacted and asked to share additional
information (see Acknowledgements). Duplicate case reports
were omitted. Missing data were not imputed.
To reach out to other centers with diagnosed but
unpublished individuals with NBAS-associated disease, we
posted a call to participate within this study on Metab-L, an
electronic mailing list on inborn errors of metabolism, on 5
December 2018.43
For the identification of previously published patients, a
comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed
and Google Scholar search engines and the 2015–2018 abstract
books from genetic, metabolic, and endocrinological scientific
societies (for details see Supplementary Information). For
quantitative analysis of the clinical phenotype, the following
variables were analyzed within this study: country of patient’s
origin, sex, age at last assessment, and whether the patient
was dead or alive at that point as well as age and cause
of death. Additionally, clinical features of the main organ
systems involved were scrutinized (see legend of Fig. 1,
nomenclature according to Human Phenotype Ontology
[HPO] terminology).
For the evaluation regarding facial dysmorphism, available
facial 2D profiles of patients were uploaded to the Face2Gene
RESEARCH app (FDNA Inc., Boston, MA44) to generate
composite photos allowing a score distribution comparing
them with age and gender-matched controls.
All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical
standards of the responsible committee on human experi￾mentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Informed consent to
participate in the study was obtained from all patients or their
parents in case of minor patients, except for cases where
patient data were retrieved from publications. Additional
informed consent was obtained from all patients for whom

identifying information is included in this article. The study
was approved by the ethical committee of the Technical
University Munich and the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The cut-off date for data analysis was 7 May 2019.
Identification of NBAS variants and ex vivo studies in
patient and control fibroblasts
NBAS variants were identified using exome sequencing; carrier
status of parents was confirmed via trio-exome sequencing or
Sanger sequencing (details available upon request). NBAS
protein levels in patient fibroblasts were measured by western
blotting as described previously.2,40
Tertiary structure predictions and sequence analysis
Prediction of the tertiary structure of the human NBAS
protein (Uniprot ID: A2RRP1) was performed by the HHpred
web server45 using the PDB70 target database; all other
parameters were set to default. We considered the hit that had
the best alignment with the query protein as the model. The
IUPRED2A web server46 was used to predict regions of
disorder and MAFFT web server47 was used for the alignment
of protein sequences.
Statistics
Count data from frequency tables were analyzed with log-linear
models in R software, a language for statistical analysis and
graphics (https://www.r-project.org) and visualized by mosaic
plots with Pearson residual-based shadings.48 The world map
was generated with the R package rworldmap.49 The medians
of two samples were compared with a Mann–Whitney U test.
For statistical evaluation of facial abnormalities, the area under
the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve was measured and statistical significance using the
P value with the two-sided population proportions test was
computed to compare each group with the age-/gender￾matched controls.

RESULTS
Study population
The literature search identified 28 publications and 7 abstracts
on individuals with biallelic pathogenic NBAS variants,
published between February 2008 and April 2019. Thirty￾three of the publications and abstracts were relevant and
provided sufficient data for this study, reporting a total of 88
patients from 81 families. Twenty-three patients from 21
families within this cohort, harboring 19 novel variants, have
not been reported in the literature before and were identified
by one of the coauthors; additionally, three patients, so far only
reported at conferences, were included in this study with more
detailed information on the phenotype. These 26 patients from
23 families are termed “novel patients” (Table 1). For the
quantitative analysis of the clinical phenotype, two individuals
(previously unreported) were excluded because age at last
assessment was before 12 months of age (NBAS 50, NBAS 64).
Furthermore, one individual was excluded because he was
identified in a family history–triggered investigation and
presented no symptoms other than Pelger–Huët anomaly
(NBAS 71).34 A fourth (previously unreported) individual was
excluded due to comorbidity unrelated to NBAS variants
(NBAS 61, Williams–Beuren syndrome).
Genetics
One hundred and ten individuals from 97 unrelated families
with biallelic pathogenic NBAS variants were identified, with a
total number of 86 different variants: 40 missense variants, 13
frameshift variants, 13 splice site variants, 12 nonsense variants,
5 exon deletions, 2 in-frame deletions, and 1 intronic variant
(see Fig. 1a). There are 66 genotypes, 13 of them homozygous.
The most frequent genotype (30 families) is homozygosity for
the missense variant c.(5741G>A) leading to the amino acid
substitution p.(Arg1914His), which however has only been
reported in the Yakut population.1 Apart from this genotype,
no specific variant combination is present in more than two
unrelated families, which indicates an extremely high genetic
heterogeneity. Most patients are homozygous for a missense
variant (n = 47) or compound heterozygous for a missense in
combination with a nonsense variant (n = 32) (see Supple￾mental Table S1). For the novel variants, functional validation
by western blotting was done when fibroblasts were available
(n = 9, see Supplementary Table S2).
Phenotypic spectrum
Patients originate from all continents except South America
(Fig. 1b). The main organ systems or processes involved were
liver, growth, skeletal system, nervous system, integument,
immune system, and musculature (Fig. 1c), but also facial
dysmorphism (Fig. 2c) and abnormalities of the endocrine
system (including diabetes mellitus type 1). For the analysis of
age, survival, and follow-up time, the 33 individuals from
Yakutia1 were excluded due to a lack of individualized data. In
the remaining patients, median age at last assessment was 7.0
years (total range: 1.0–42 years; 639 cumulative patient years)
(Fig. 1d). Sixty-three patients were alive at the time of this
report while 10 individuals had died—of whom 9 passed away
due to acute liver failure (ALF) (median age at death: 2.3
years, range: 1.5–3.9 years) and one during liver transplant
procedure at the age of 15 years (NBAS 51). Six patients
underwent liver transplantation between the age of 1 and 6
years (median 2.8 years; age at first transplantation procedure
in case of several transplantations). Follow-up time after
transplantation is 0–14 years (cumulative time 44 years); none
of these patients presented with a liver crisis after transplan￾tation. For detailed information on individual patients see
Supplementary Table S1.
Within the group of the 26 novel patients (Table 1) and as
observed during follow-up of previously reported patients,
new phenotypic aspects include inverted nipples at birth,
lipodystrophy, joint laxity, dislocation of the lens, pre￾mature loss of milk teeth (connective tissue), relatively small
foramen magnum, spinal cord compression with lower limb
weakness (skeletal system), chronic lung disease with
oxygen dependency and bilevel positive airway pressure
(BiPAP) respiratory support, recurrent bacterial pneumonia
(respiratory system) and elevated 3-methylglutaconic acid
in urine during liver crises with normalization in the
interval between crises (n = 2, metabolism).
Genotype–phenotype correlation
Given the heterogeneity of the individual patients’ pheno￾types and the wide range of symptoms associated with
biallelic pathogenic NBAS variants, we aimed to explore
clinical subgroups. It has already been reported that patients
with missense variants in the region coding for the Sec39
domain of NBAS have a predominant liver phenotype with
RALF.3,35 Indeed, this holds true for patients compound
heterozygous for a missense variant in the region coding
for the Sec39 domain plus a loss-of-function variant,
independent from its localization. Interestingly, there are
no individuals with biallelic nonsense variants, except one
with a late frameshift variant c.(6966_6969delinsTC) in the
last exon in combination with the variant c.(5547delC)
(NBAS 57). In this case, immunoblotting revealed a reduced
protein concentration of NBAS with a protein band showing
nearly full-length size, whereas there is no second band of
smaller size. This argues for a truncated protein as a result to
the c.(6966_6969delinsTC), p.(Gln2322Hisfs*18), whereas
the transcript of c.(5547delC) likely undergoes NMD. In
further immunoblots of patient cells harboring nonsense
variants, no smaller band corresponding to the expression of
a truncated protein has been observed (n = 12 [refs. 3,10] and
authors’ unpublished data). These observations indicate that
transcripts with nonsense variants undergo NMD indepen￾dently from the location of the nonsense variant. Hence, we
hypothesize, in line with the concept of edgetic perturbations
of protein functions,50 that the localization of the missense
variants or in-frame deletions determines the phenotype of
the respective patient.
To test this hypothesis, we first grouped missense variants
and in-frame deletions according to their localization,

whereas the latter is defined as the deletion of one amino acid.
To provide insights into the structural location of each
variant, we predicted structures using HHpred,45 which
identified a single significant hit for the region 722–1369
and several significant hits in the region 86–446. The
remaining part of the protein displayed no significant hits.
Secondary structure45,51 and disorder52 predictions suggest
several discrete regions in human NBAS (Uniprot ID:
A2RRP1): a partly disordered, partly helical N-terminus
(residues 1–85), a region consisting of mostly β-strands in
WD40 repeats (86–446), with the remainder of the protein
being predominantly helical (447–2371). Prediction of tertiary
structure using HHpred web server45 defined an N-terminal
β-propeller region roughly from residues 86 to 446, and an
α-solenoid (TPR repeat) regions at residues 722–1369.

Fig. 2 From protein to disease: tertiary structure of NBAS, localization of missense variants and in-frame deletions, disorder prediction, and
phenotypic patterns of the three domain-related subgroups. (a) Tertiary structure modeling and disorder predictions of NBAS. Structural predictions
were determined using the HHpred suite. The region 86–446 was modeled from the A chain of COMPASS histone methyltransferase in yeast (PDB:
6CHG_A; probability: 98.5; p value: 9.8e-12), and the region 722–1369 was modeled from the D chain of DslI transport complex in yeast (PDB: 3K8P_D;
probability: 100; p value: 6.9e-66). Red inverted triangles indicate predicted regions with high disorder scores (1–41, 459–475, 644–657, 1382–1398,
1933–1947). The disorder score for the entire protein was determined using the IUPRED server. Missense variants and in-frame deletions are indicated as
gray dots on the gene as well as gray Calpha spheres in the two modeled domains as best as possible. (b) Phenotypic patterns of the three subgroups β￾propeller, Sec39 and C-terminal. (c) Facial phenotypes (composite faces). All patients tend to present thicker eyebrows and broader columella, but only
patients attributed to the C-terminal group significantly differ from their controls, presenting triangular face, wide palpebral fissures, deep set eyes and thin
upper lip vermilion, thick eyebrows, short philtrum, and small mouth. AUC area under the curve, ROC receiver operating characteristic.

delineate these structures (Fig. 2a). Our defined β-propeller
region is considerably (approximately 80 amino acids)
longer than defined previously,2 where definition was based
on a weak match to a domain from a quinoprotein amine
dehydrogenase (InterPro: IPR011044). Our match is highly
significant and agrees well with the predictions of β-strands,
which are largely absent in the other parts of the protein.
We found only one significant α-solenoid structure match,
which was to Sec39 from yeast,53 which is the only (to date)
structure of a Sec39 domain containing protein. The
alignment covers the entirety of this structure, but only a
small fraction of the NBAS C-terminus. This fact, plus the
tendency of long-predicted helices, argues that likely we are
not detecting long segments of helical repeat structures, since
they are highly variable in sequence.
Interestingly, most missense variants and in-frame deletions
cluster in the coding regions of the β-propeller domain, the
Sec39 domain, and the C-terminal part of NBAS as well as in
proximity to the regions of disorder identified by IUPred2
(Figs. 1a, 2a). Furthermore, we found these mutated residues
more evolutionarily conserved than other residues (MAFFT47,
Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05). Loss-of-function (nonsense or
splice site) variants are found more evenly distributed. Seven
patients are biallelic for a nonsense plus a splice site variant or
two splice site variants. For six of these seven patients (NBAS 6,
11, 47, 48, 79, 80) with four different splice site variants
(c.[6237-3C>G]; c.[6432+1_6433-1]_[6711 + 1_6712-1]del;
c.[6840G>A]; c.[6840G>T]), immunoblotting and/or comple￾mentary DNA (cDNA) analysis revealed that mutant RNA
escapes NMD leading to the expression of a shorter protein
(refs. 3,24,35 and authorsʼ data, available upon request). For the
seventh patient (NBAS 49), no fibroblasts were available.26
Accordingly, these variants were considered distinct to loss-of￾function variants and—together with all missense variants and
in-frame deletions—called determining variants in the follow￾ing. Based on the localization of the determining variants,
patients were attributed to three groups: β-propeller, Sec39, and
C-terminal. Strikingly, these three groups have different clinical
patterns; whereas determining variants in the coding region for
the Sec39 domain are mainly associated with ALF, determining
variants in the coding region for the C-terminus show a
predominant multisystemic phenotype. Patients with determin￾ing variants in the region coding for the β-propeller domain,
however, present with a combined severe phenotype including
both ALF and multisystemic features (Fig. 2b).
Four patients are compound heterozygous for missense
variants in regions coding for different domains and can
therefore not be clearly attributed to one of the three groups
based on their genotype. Their clinical presentation includes
features of the respective subgroups, underlining a close
relationship between variant localization and clinical pheno￾type (see Supplementary Table S1). The six patients with
confirmed aberrant protein or transcript due to a splice site
variant were attributed according to the localization of these
splice site variants, whereas patient NBAS 49 was not
attributed to a group.
To test whether differences in phenotypes between the three
groups are statistically significant, log-linear models were
calculated. While there was no difference of prevalence of NK
cell deficiency and intellectual disability, all other features
tested distribute unequally (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Short stature was present in all three groups, but height
standard deviation score (SDS) differs significantly between
Sec39 and C-terminal (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.00034,
Fig. 3).
For the analysis of facial abnormalities, photographs from
39 patients were available (refs. 1,3,4,6,8,10,11,14,17,24,35,54,55 and
authorsʼ patients) and assigned to one of the three groups (β￾propeller n = 10, Sec39 n = 11, C-terminal n = 18). There is a
significant difference in the facial presentation of the C￾terminal group compared with the matched control cohort
(p = 0.009), while the other two groups (β-propeller and
Sec39) did not differ significantly from their controls (Fig. 2c).
DISCUSSION
We present an international, multicenter cross-sectional study
on the clinical phenotypes of individuals with NBAS￾associated disease in a cohort of 110 patients from 97 families
with a total of 639 patient years. This report adds data of 26
novel patients to the literature, including 19 previously
unreported variants, creating a total number of 86 known
pathogenic variants. Genotype–phenotype associations are
explored based on variant localizations including models of
the tertiary structure of NBAS.
NBAS-associated disease is related to a wide spectrum of
clinical signs and symptoms mainly affecting liver, growth,
integument, immune system, skeletal system, nervous system,
and musculature. In line with the concept of edgetic
perturbation,50 our study demonstrates that phenotypes can
be grouped into three clinical subgroups based on the
localization of missense variants or in-frame deletions to
one of the two regions coding for the known domains or the
C-terminal part of NBAS. These three groups differ
significantly. Considering the currently used terms for clinical
syndromes associated with pathogenic NBAS variants, ILFS2
(MIM 616483) resembles patients with variants affecting
Sec39, whereas SOPH syndrome (MIM 614800) resembles
patients with variants affecting the C-terminal part of the
gene. Interestingly, patients with variants affecting the β￾propeller domain present a combined phenotype that may be
considered as an overlap of ILFS2 and SOPH syndrome,
including clinical features of both groups.
These findings have a direct impact on patient manage￾ment, e.g., regular screening for reduced IgG levels or optic
atrophy for patients with variants affecting the β-propeller
domain or the C-terminus and high awareness for the risk of
fever-related, life-threatening ALF in patients with variants
affecting the β-propeller or the Sec39 domain. The latter is of
special importance, as early and aggressive antipyretic
treatment together with glucose and lipid infusion during
ALF has been reported to reduce severity of ALF in NBAS
deficiency.3,14
STAUFNER et al ARTICLE
GENETICS in MEDICINE | Volume 22 | Number 3 | March 2020 617

A recent study investigated the facial characteristics of
patients with NBAS-associated disease using DeepGestalt,35
confirming the previously reported characteristics of hypote￾lorism, thin lips, pointed chin, and progeroid appearance.3
However, facial phenotypes had not been related to the
remaining symptoms or genotypes of the patients. We
demonstrate that the facial phenotype depends on the
genotype (Fig. 2c).
Given the rapidly increasing patient numbers since its
first report, NBAS-associated disease is likely still an under￾diagnosed condition. As there are no biomarkers to date,
diagnosis relies on genetic testing, mainly exome sequencing.
The definition of clinical subgroups with distinct phenotypic
patterns will help to identify clinical candidates, facilitates
phenotype-based variant filters in the analysis of exome data,
and will help to establish earlier diagnosis in patients with
NBAS-associated disease.
Our study is limited by the fact that the majority of study
individuals are still in infancy or early childhood. Aspects of an
evolving clinical phenotype might thus be underrepresented
suggesting additional follow-up investigations are needed,
including the reevaluation of the described clinical patterns
within the growing patient numbers. In addition, our data also
suggest that studies not only on natural history but also
pathomechanism in NBAS deficiency should differentiate
between the different clinical subtypes of the disease, based on
the genotype. Apart from patient management, our findings are
of importance for the understanding of the protein function,
suggesting domain-specific roles. Overall, NBAS resembles
several proteins in the nuclear pore, clathrin-coated vesicles,
and intraflagellar transport, many of which also contain an N￾terminal β-propeller (WD repeat) region with a flexible, long C￾terminal region consisting of ɑ-solenoid (TPR) repeats.56
Generally, these proteins serve as scaffolds to interact with
multiple protein partners. Though we could not identify any
sequence-similar templates to model an interaction,57 it is very
likely that both the propeller and solenoid regions help binding
to one or more of the NBAS interaction partners. β-propellers
have a preferred binding site at the top of the barrel,58 though as
scaffolds they can, in principle, bind at alternative sites.

The apparent accumulation of variants on one face suggests that
they could be affecting the same (albeit unknown) set of
interaction partners binding to this side of the propeller.
Genotype–phenotype associations argue for a role of the
Sec39 domain for liver function, thereby associating liver
dysfunction with altered intracellular transport, as Sec39 is
required for tethering at the ER in the syntaxin18 complex.
This is underlined by the fact that deficient RINT1, a direct
interaction partner of NBAS within this complex, also leads to
RALF. ER stress and altered autophagy may be involved in the
pathomechanism,2,39 but mechanisms of fever-dependent,
syntaxin18–related RALF are still poorly understood.
The high prevalence of various multisystemic symptoms
associated with variants affecting the C-terminal part of
NBAS point to important functions of this part of the protein,
which so far has no defined domains and for which no reliable
3D modeling is currently possible. It is an interesting
observation that the C-terminal missense variants cluster in
close proximity to the variant prevalent in the Yakut
population c.(5741G>A) and in close relation to a highly
disordered region (IUPred2 score), which might suggest a
short peptide binding region (or linear motif).59
The combined severe phenotype caused by variants in the
coding region of the β-propeller domain, a domain that is
per se difficult to fold,60 might reflect disturbed functions of
both the Sec39 and C-terminal parts due to an altered β￾propeller. This might be due to hampered protein interaction
with other partners or misfolding of the whole protein. The
latter could be of interest for a therapeutic approach to
promote folding by specific chaperones in the future.
However, further studies are needed to improve our knowl￾edge about the tertiary structure of NBAS, domain-specific
protein functions, and potential sites of interaction.
This is the first work systematically and quantitatively
analyzing patients with NBAS-associated disease, based on the
largest cohort studied so far, including more than 100 patients
and adding 26 novel patients to the literature. Based on the
localization of missense variants or in-frame deletions, most
affected individuals can be grouped into three subgroups. We
suggest to name the distinct clinical subgroups ILFS2 (Sec39),
SOPH (C-terminal), and ILFS2-SOPH (β-propeller). Our
study facilitates patient management, which should be guided
by the specific phenotypic patterns. Ultimately, improved
knowledge of domain-specific functions will boost our
understanding of both biology and human disease related to
variants in NBAS.
