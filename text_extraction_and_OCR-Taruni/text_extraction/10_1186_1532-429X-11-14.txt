Abstract
The pericardium and pericardial diseases in particular have received, in contrast to other topics in
the field of cardiology, relatively limited interest. Today, despite improved knowledge of
pathophysiology of pericardial diseases and the availability of a wide spectrum of diagnostic tools,
the diagnostic challenge remains. Not only the clinical presentation may be atypical, mimicking
other cardiac, pulmonary or pleural diseases; in developed countries a shift for instance in the
epidemiology of constrictive pericarditis has been noted. Accurate decision making is crucial taking
into account the significant morbidity and mortality caused by complicated pericardial diseases, and
the potential benefit of therapeutic interventions. Imaging herein has an important role, and
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is definitely one of the most versatile modalities to study
the pericardium. It fuses excellent anatomic detail and tissue characterization with accurate
evaluation of cardiac function and assessment of the haemodynamic consequences of pericardial
constraint on cardiac filling. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge how CMR can
be used to study the most common pericardial diseases.
Pericardial anatomy and physiology
Although the normal pericardium is a thin, avascular, rel￾atively inelastic, flask-shaped sac enveloping the heart,
this structure is an important determinant of cardiac fill￾ing [1-3]. In most cases, evaluation of pericardial diseases
extends beyond morphologic assessment, and the diag￾nostic challenge is to determine the impact of abnormal
pericardium on cardiac filling. Anatomically, the pericar￾dium is composed of two layers, an inner serous mem￾brane and an outer fibrocollagenous layer [3]. The inner
serosal layer, termed the visceral pericardium, is closely
attached to the epicardial surface of the heart and covers a
subepicardial layer of conjunctive tissue containing fat
and coronary vessels. The serosal layer reflects back on
itself to become the inner lining of the outer fibrous layer.
Together, these layers form the parietal pericardium. The
pericardium contains two major pericardial sinuses which
are composed of different recesses [4]. The transverse
sinus is the connection between the two tubes of pericar￾dium that envelop the great vessels. The aorta and pulmo￾nary artery are enclosed in one anterosuperior tube, and
the vena cava and pulmonary veins are enclosed in a more
posterior tube. The oblique sinus lies behind the left
atrium so that the posterior wall of the left atrium is actu￾ally separated from the pericardial space. This explains
why a posterior pericardial effusion is seen behind the left
atrium only when it is very large. The pericardial virtual
cavity normally contains between 10 and 50 ml of an
ultrafiltrate of plasma [5]. The fluid is produced by the vis￾ceral pericardium and drainage of the cavity is toward
both the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct.
The pericardium holds the heart within the anterior medi￾astinum, protecting it form adjacent organs. Its relative

inelasticity provides constraint during diastolic filling
which limits chamber dilation, particularly of the thin￾walled right atrium and ventricle [2]. While acute pericar￾dial dilation is limited because of its exponential pressure￾volume relation, chronic pericardial stress, e.g. slowly
accumulating pericardial effusion or left ventricular
remodeling, in contrast, may occur without pericardial
constriction [1,6,7]. As the pericardium slowly dilates, the
pericardial pressure-volume relation shifts to the right,
explaining why chronic pericardial effusion may become
quite large without compressing the cardiac chambers [8].
The pericardium, moreover, equalizes compliance
between right and thicker walled left ventricle, and pro￾duces interdependence of filling between ventricles, a
phenomenon also called "ventricular coupling" (see con￾strictive pericarditis). Though, normally not physiologi￾cally important, ventricular coupling is exaggerated and a
key diagnostic feature when intrapericardial pressure is
increased (as in cardiac tamponade) or when the pericar￾dial cavity is fixed (as in constrictive pericarditis) [2,6-10].
Finally, the pericardium acts also as a physiological inter￾mediate between the pleural space and heart chambers,
and the respiratory changes in intrathoracic pressure are
directly transmitted to the subatmospheric pericardial
cavity and subsequently to the cardiac chambers. Because
of its thinner wall, this interaction is more pronounced on
the right than on the left ventricle.
CMR techniques
Comprehensive pericardial imaging should provide infor￾mation on morphologic characteristics of the pericardium
and cardiac structures, and assess the impact of pericardial
diseases on cardiac function, in particular cardiac filling.
Though CMR is traditionally considered together with
computed tomography (CT), as the preferred imaging
modality to morphologically visualize the pericardium
and pericardial space, CMR can substantially aid in clari￾fying the intricate relation between pericardial constraint
and cardiac filling. Black-blood T1-weighted spin-echo
CMR, using a fast, segmented sequence, is the best
approach to visualize, the heart, pericardium and medi￾astinum [11,12]. Use of a small field of view and a satura￾tion block positioned on the frontal chest wall may
hereby improve pericardial visualization. Scanning in two
perpendicular oriented planes through the heart guaran￾tees optimal depiction of the entire pericardium, for
instance, using a set of axial views combined with coronal
or cardiac short-axis views. T2-weighted spin-echo CMR,
preferably using a short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR)
sequence (also called "triple-inversion" spin-echo),
highly useful to depict myocardial edema [13,14], can
also be applied to detect pericardial fluid and/or edema of
the pericardial layers in patients with inflammatory peri￾carditis. Use of paramagnetic contrast agents can be rec￾ommended in case of pericardial masses, inflammatory
pericarditis, to depict concomitant myocardial pathology
(e.g. myocarditis) and may be useful to better differentiate
between inflammatory and constrictive forms of pericar￾ditis. Either T1-weighted spin-echo CMR or inversion￾recovery gradient-echo CMR with late enhancement (LGE
CMR) is fit for post-contrast imaging [15-17].
Cine CMR, using balanced steady-state free precession
(SSFP) gradient-echo sequences, is today the reference
technique to quantify global and regional cardiac systolic
function, and is of interest for example to rule out under￾lying RV or LV dysfunction in patients clinically suspected
of constrictive pericarditis. Moreover, the high spatial and
temporal resolution of cine CMR can be applied to exploit
new applications such as the assessment of pericardial
mobility, which can help in depicting a rigid pericardium
in patients with a non or minimally thickened constrictive
pericarditis. The availability of new real-time cine
sequences enabled to study dynamic, fast-changing, phys￾iologic events such as ventricular coupling (see
below)[18]. CMR tagging techniques may be of use to
detect fibrotic adhesion of pericardial layers or to diag￾nose myocardial involvement in constrictive pericarditis
[19]. Assessment of diastolic heart function, though usu￾ally obtained with Doppler-echocardiography, can be
achieved with velocity-encoded or phase-contrast CMR
technique too [11,20,21]. Analysis of pulmonary and/or
systemic venous pattern in combination with cardiac
inflow patterns through the atrioventricular valves can
yield findings that are classic for restrictive cardiac filling.
To conclude, improvements in CMR technology have
shifted the way this technique can be applied to study the
pericardium from basically a static morphologic assess￾ment toward an integrated dynamic morphological-func￾tional approach, raising the hope to improve diagnostic
testing to the often complex and intriguing group of peri￾cardial disorders (Appendix 1).
Normal pericardium
Normal pericardium is visible on spin-echo CMR as a
thin, smooth, low-intensity curvilinear structure sur￾rounded by high-intensity mediastinal and epicardial fat,
or medium-intensity myocardium (Fig. 1) [22,23]. The
low signal of adjacent lung parenchyma and paucity of
surrounding fat, may hamper the pericardial visualization
over the free wall of the left ventricle [22]. The transverse
pericardial sinus, preaortic and retroaortic recesses can be
identified in the majority of patients [23,24]. Especially
the superior pericardial recesses should not be mistaken
for a focal aortic dissection or enlarged lymph nodes (Fig.
1d) [4,25,26]. On b-SSFP cine CMR, the pericardial layers
have a low signal intensity while pericardial fluid has a
high signal intensity. On CMR, normal pericardium meas￾ures 1.2 mm in diastole to 1.7 mm in systole, which are
larger than those found in anatomical studies of the heart,
ie, 0.4–1 mm [27-29]. The overestimation of pericardial

thickness on CMR is due to motion of pericardial layers,
lack of sufficient spatial resolution, and chemical shift
artifacts at the fat-fluid interface on cine CMR.
Congenital pericardial anomalies
Pericardial Cyst
Pericardial cysts are congenital encapsulated cysts
implanted on the pericardium that are not connected with
the pericardial cavity. They typically occur in the cardio￾phrenic sulcus (90%), most often right-sided (70%). On
chest radiography, they present as a well-defined out￾pouching on the lateral heart border. On CMR, they
appear as a well-defined homogeneous paracardiac struc￾ture, having the signal characteristics of water, implanted
on the pericardium (Fig. 2)[27]. Pericardial cysts are usu￾ally asymptomatic, though rarely they may become symp￾tomatic when compressing other cardiac structures.
Pericardial cysts should be differentiated from encapsu￾lated pericardial effusions, and other cystic structures such
as bronchogenic cysts and thymic cysts.
Pericardial Defect
Congenital pericardial agenesis is an uncommon entity,
and is considered to result from an abnormal embryonic
development that may be secondary to abnormalities in
the vascular supply of the pericardium. Pericardial defects
occur in a spectrum ranging from a small defect to total
absence of the pericardium. Partial defects (large more
common than small partial defects) are far more common
than total defects [27,30]. It may be associated, in at least
one-third of cases, with other malformations, particularly
malformations of the heart (tetralogy of Fallot, atrial sep￾tal defect, patent ductus arteriosus) or other types of
abnormalities (bronchogenic cyst or hiatus hernia)
[31,32]. Cardiac structures or portions of the lung can her￾niate through the defect. The clinical presentation is vari￾able. Patients are often asymptomatic, and the disease
may be detected on routine chest radiograph as an abnor￾mal left cardiac contour [33]. Symptoms occur when car￾diac structures are transiently entrapped or incarcerated in
the defect. Herniation of the left atrial appendage through
a small defect may lead to infarction of the appendage or
the left coronary artery might be compressed leading to
ischaemia especially during exercise [30].
The diagnosis of a pericardial defect is not always straight￾forward on CMR, since in normal conditions the pericar￾dium over the lateral side of the left ventricle,
corresponding to the most frequent location of pericardial
defects, is usually not well depicted because of a paucity of
surrounding fat [34]. So, the diagnosis usually relies on
other signs such as an abnormal location of cardiac struc￾tures with excessive levorotation or cardiac indentation at
the location of the defect [35,36]. Since herniation is often
intermittent in time, positional changes such as to posi￾tioning the patient in left lateral decubitus can be helpful
in diagnosing pericardial defects. Functional examination
may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of congenital
pericardial defect. Whereas the normal cardiac apex is
essentially stationary in the chest during the cardiac cycle,
excessive mobility may be indicative of a pericardial defect
[37].
Pericardial Diverticulum
Pericardial diverticulum is an exceedingly rare condition
that can be congenital or acquired. It corresponds to a her￾niation through a defect in the parietal pericardium that
communicates with the pericardial cavity [27]. Congenital
diverticula result from a failure in the fusion of one of the
mesenchymal lacunae that normally concur to form the
pericardial sac. They typically occur in the cardiophrenic
angles and have the tendency to change in size over time.
CMR is helpful in reaching a preoperative diagnosis.
Although it resembles a pericardial cyst, the diagnosis of a
diverticulum should be suspected when a complete wall
cannot be identified in all parts of the lesion [38].

Acquired pericardial diseases
Pericardial Effusion
Abnormal fluid accumulation may be seen in heart fail￾ure, renal insufficiency, infection (bacterial, viral, tubercu￾lous), neoplasm (carcinoma of lung, breast, lymphoma),
trauma, and myocardial infarction [39]. Imaging is often
required to confirm the presence, severity and extent of
fluid; to characterize the nature of fluid; to rule out peri￾cardial inflammation; to determine the haemodynamic
impact on the heart; and to guide pericardiocentesis. For
this purpose, echocardiography is the standard. However,
image quality and interpretation may be hampered by
acoustic window, and in obese patients or in those with
obstructive lung disease, necessitating additional imaging,
such as CT or CMR. With exception of transesophageal
echocardiography, this technique is generally unreliable
for assessment of pericardial thickness, and may be of lim￾ited value in detecting loculated effusions [2,11,12].
Because the pericardial sac can be easily and completely
visualized on CMR, this technique is superior to detect the

distribution and amount of fluid accumulation than with
echocardiography [40]. Although CMR can detect pericar￾dial effusions as small as 30 ml, a clear-cut relationship
between the measured width of the pericardial space and
total fluid volume cannot be established because pericar￾dial fluid accumulation is often not homogeneously
spread (Fig. 3). Due to the gravitational dependency, focal
fluid accumulaton posterolateral to the left ventricle and
along the inferolateral wall of the RV are not infrequent
(Fig. 4)[23]. Another common location is the superior
pericardial recess. In general, a pericardial width greater
than 4 mm should be regarded as abnormal. Moderate
effusions (between 100 and 500 ml of fluid) are associ￾ated with a greater than 5 mm pericardial space anterior to
the right ventricle [22,28]. Similar to ventricular volumet￾ric quantification, a multislice approach can be used to
quantify the precise amount of pericardial fluid.
Because the stretching capacity of the pericardial layers is
limited, acute accumulation of pericardial contents (e.g.,
fluid, blood, air) can lead to cardiac chamber compres￾sion with decreased cardiac filling and subsequently
impaired stroke volume, a phenomenon called "cardiac
tamponade" [40]. The symptomatology can be dramatic,
potentially lethal within minutes after onset. Symptoms
are linked to the increase in pericardial pressure deter￾mined by the absolute volume of fluid, rate of fluid accu￾mulation, and the physical characteristics of the
pericardium (degree of stretching)(Fig. 4). The diagnosis
of pericardial tamponade is a clinical one that is usually
confirmed by echocardiography. Hallmarks of cardiac
tamponade are the diastolic inversion or collapse of the
RV free wall indicating intrapericardial pressure exceeding
interventricular pressure; right atrial compression during
early systole; exaggerated respiratory variation in cardiac
inflow; and abnormal flow patterns in the caval veins
[41]. Though, CMR has a limited role in the diagnosis of
acute cardiac tamponade; chronic, less severe, forms can
be encountered in patients with pericardial effusion on
CMR (Fig. 3c) [see Additional file 1]. Care should be taken
to look for features of constriction, which can occur tran￾siently in the resolution phase, after pericardiocentesis or
with organized effusions (see below effusive-constrictive
pericarditis)[2].
Analysis of CMR signals enables, at least to some extent,
fluid characterization. Transudates typically have a low
signal intensity on T1-weighted spin-echo CMR, and a
high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Exudates,
having a high protein and cell content, increase T1-relax￾ation (higher signal intensity) and shorten T2-relaxation
(lower signal intensity)(Figs. 3, 4). However, because of
motion artifacts, pericardial fluid characterization is not
always feasible. In particular non-linear motion of peri￾cardial fluid during cardiac motion may falsely cause high
signal on T1-weighted spin-echo CMR within the effusion
even in the presence of a simple transudate. Moreover
characterization of small effusions may be often difficult.
The signal intensity of a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion
is dependent on the duration of the disease (see pericar￾dial hematoma). With balanced SSFP-gradient-echo tech￾niques, often a better characterization of the pericardial
fluid content can be achieved such as the visualization of
fibrinous strands or presence of coagulated blood. Other

abnormalities helpful in the diagnosis are depiction of
thickened pericardial blades with assessment of pericar￾dial inflammation [11,17].
Pericardial Inflammation
Inflammation of the pericardium (inflammatory pericardi￾tis) presents in many clinical settings and has a wide range
of causes [2]. The acute presentation is an important dif￾ferential in the assessment of acute chest pain, but pericar￾ditis can also present in subacute or chronic forms. The
symptoms are mainly related to the severity of pericardial
inflammation. Although the true incidence and preva￾lence of pericarditis are difficult to measure, a prevalence
of 1% in autopsy studies suggests that pericarditis may be
subclinical [2]. In up to 30% of patients no cause of peri￾carditis can be defined (idiopathic). Infections (viral/bac￾terial/tuberculosis/fungal) are common causes of acute
pericarditis. It can be noted that organisms responsible for
myocarditis are commonly implicated. In developed
countries, tuberculosis has become less common, but
should still be considered in immunocompromised hosts
[1,2,42]. Radiation therapy for treatment of mediastinal
tumors and breast cancer is an increasingly important
cause of pericarditis and pericardial constriction. Pericar￾ditis can be a manifestation of various systemic diseases
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
scleroderma); can be secondary to primary or metastatic
pericardial disease, and can be found in patients with ure￾mia or following an acute myocardial infarction. The lat￾ter occurs early postinfarction and is typically found in
transmural infarctions. This condition should be differen￾tiated from late postinfarction pericarditis (Dressler's syn￾drome). While acute post-infarction pericarditis, also
called "epistenocardic pericarditis", has a close temporal
relation with the acute event due to the pericardial spread
of infarct-related inflammation, Dressler's syndrome has
an autoimmune etiology without a close temporal rela￾tion with myocardial infarction. Finally, direct or indirect
trauma can cause traumatic pericarditis.
In the acute phase, inflammation of the pericardial layers
is characterized by formation of young, highly vascular￾ized granulation tissue with fibrin deposition [17]. Usu￾ally, a variable amount of pericardial fluid is present, and
the fibrin deposition may lead to a fibrinous adhesion of
the pericardial layers. Chronic inflammation is character￾ized by a progressive sclerosing pericarditis with fibrob￾lasts, collagen and a lesser amount of fibrin deposition
[18]. This may progress towards an end-stage, chronic
fibrosing pericarditis with fibroblasts and collagen. The
main feature of this end-stage is a stiff pericardium with
constriction of the heart (constrictive pericarditis).
Detection of inflammatory pericarditis has become less
challenging with the availability of modern CMR tech￾niques [11,12,19]. Both thickening of pericardial layers,
and depiction of associated pericardial effusion can be
well depicted on T1-weighted spin-echo CMR or cine
CMR, while T2-weighted STIR spin-echo CMR allows vis￾ualization of edema of the inflamed pericardial layers
(Fig. 5). Pericardial enhancement on gadolinium￾enhanced CMR studies is an appropriate way to detect
pericardial inflammation (Fig. 5)[17]. Both LGE CMR or
spin-echo CMR are useful. Addition of a fat-suppression
prepulse may be interesting to enhance visualization of
pericardial inflammation. Other interesting imaging fea￾tures are assessment of pericardial layer delineation,
which might become more irregular in cases of chronic
pericarditis and streaky enhancement of the surrounding
fat and enhancement of adjacent myocardial tissue, indi￾cating associated epicarditis or myocarditis, respectively.
Today, CMR is considered the non-invasive standard to
depict myocarditis [43,44]. In a recent study, Yelgec and
colleagues reported pericardial enhancement in 9 and
pericardial effusion in 6 patients in a group of 20 patients
studied with CMR for clinical suspicion of acute myocar￾ditis [45], indicating myopericarditis is not an uncom￾mon presentation. Tagging CMR techniques may be of use
to well depict fibrotic adhesions of pericardial layers (Fig.
6) [see Additional file 2] [19].

Constrictive Pericarditis
Chronic fibrosing pericarditis is characterized by a thick￾ened, fibrotic and/or calcified pericardium, not infre￾quently constricting the heart and impairing cardiac
filling ("constrictive" pericarditis) [46]. Patients with peri￾cardial constriction typically present with manifestations
of elevated systemic venous pressures and low cardiac out￾put [47]. The diagnosis should always be considered in
patients presenting with predominant right heart failure
symptoms [48]. The pathophysiological hallmarks of
pericardial constriction, which are caused by confinement
of the cardiac chambers by the rigid, fixed pericardial vol￾ume, are equalization of end-diastolic pressures in all 4
cardiac chambers, and increased ventricular coupling
which is strongly influenced by respiration [1,2].
Pericardial constriction is most commonly idiopathic but
can be the end result of any cause of inflammatory peri￾carditis. Tuberculosis has become less frequent, while car￾diac surgery and radiation-induced pericarditis have
become also important [2]. In non-tuberculous pericardi￾tis pericardial thickening and calcification may be less
prominent. In radiation therapy, systolic dysfunction may
accompany constriction and is a marker of poor prognosis
after pericardiectomy. Pathology typically shows an avas￾cular collagen-rich, fibrotic tissue, often containing areas
of calcification. Moreover, in extensive cases the fibrosing
process may be adherent or even involve the myocardium.
Today, despite a wide arsenal diagnostic tools, the diagno￾sis of constrictive pericarditis often remains a challenge,
and the diagnostic approach taken should be individual￾ized for each patient. First, all other causes of (right) heart
failure (e.g. pulmonary hypertension, LV/RV infarction)
should be excluded. Second, it should be determined
whether the pericardium is causing constriction hereby
impeding cardiac filling, and thirdly whether the patient
will benefit of a pericardial stripping. One of the major
dilemmas, is that diseases with decreased myocardial
compliance, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, are also
characterized by impaired cardiac filling, and may present
in a very similar way. Distinction between the two entities
is crucial, because constrictive pericarditis patients are
potentially successfully treated by early pericardiectomy
whilst for restrictive cardiomyopathy medical treatment is
recommended [46-50]. Several other factors may hamper
straightforward diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. The
morphologic pericardial abnormalities classically found
in constrictive pericarditis may be not impressive, be
absent or have an atypical presentation. Moreover,
increased pericardial thickness does not necessarily imply
pericardial constriction, and vice versa [2]. Finally, for
instance in patients with a history of radiation therapy,
restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis
may simultaneously occur. This makes the diagnosis of
constrictive pericarditis, especially in atypical or complex
cases, often challenging. Since no one method is com￾pletely reliable, information from more than one imaging
technique should be considered to provide an assessment
of anatomical and physiological function [48].
Morphologic Abnormalities
The typical morphological presentation of constrictive
pericarditis is a more or less generalized thickening of the
pericardium. This thickening is usually most pronounced
over the right heart side (right ventricle and anterior atri￾oventricular groove), and the pericardial delineation is
often irregular (Fig. 7)[51]. The underlying cardiac cavities
may be constricted by the abnormal pericardium, having
a flattened or tubular-shaped appearance. Indirectly, as a
result of the increased cardiac filling pressures, unilateral
or bilateral atrial enlargement, dilatation of caval and

hepatic veins, pleural effusion, ascites are encountered.
Useful criteria to assess pericardial thickness by CMR are
a) pericardial thickness 2 mm or less: normal, b) pericar￾dial thickness greater than 4 mm: suggestive of pericardial
constriction in patients with the appropriate clinical pres￾entation, c) pericardial thickness greater than 5–6 mm:
high specificity for constriction [52-54]. The thickened
fibrotic and/or calcified pericardium has a low signal not
only on T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo CMR but also on
cine imaging (Fig. 8). In end-stage chronic fibrosing forms
of constrictive pericarditis there is no enhancement after
gadolinium (Fig. 8) [see Additional file 3]. [17]. Pericar￾dial enhancement is suggestive of residual inflammation.
Differentiation between pericardial thickening and effu￾sion is usually straightforward using a comprehensive
CMR approach. Today, CT is the most appropriate tech￾nique to depict, even minute amounts of pericardial cal￾cium, whereas significant deposits may be missed by
CMR.
In a considerable number of patients the classical mor￾phologic findings are lacking. Pericardial constriction
may occur in any condition where the compliance of the
pericardium is decreased. Effusive-constrictive pericarditis
is a condition where the constriction is not relieved after
removal of the pericardial fluid [55-57]. This condition
was found in 15 of 218 pericarditis patients presenting
with cardiac tamponade [55]. It is believed the non-com￾pliant visceral pericardium is causing the constriction. The
diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis is often chal￾lenging because the morphologic abnormalities, even at
visual inspection, are not impressive [57]. It is believed
that effusive-constrictive pericarditis most likely repre￾sents an intermediate transition from acute pericarditis
with pericardial effusion to pericardial constriction [57].
Transient cardiac constriction is not uncommon in
patients with effusive acute idiopathic pericarditis
[58,59]. Features of constriction may be detected in the
phase of resolution of pericarditis, at a time when signs of
activity have abated, and residual effusion is minimal or
has disappeared entirely. The clinical and haemodynami￾cal features of constriction spontaneously subside after a
couple of months [56]. Most likely the inflammatory
thickened pericardium has a decreased compliance caus￾ing symptoms of temporary constriction (inflammatory￾constrictive form)(Fig. 9) [see Additional file 4]. Both
entities underscore the variable evolution in patients with
acute pericarditis, and represent an intermediate between
spontaneous resolution and evolution toward constrictive
pericarditis. The ability to differentiate fluid from pericar￾dial layer, and to depict pericardial inflammation, makes
CMR appealing to assess these atypical forms of constric￾tive pericarditis [11,15,17]. In some cases pericardial
abnormalities might be very localized (focal constrictive

pericarditis). Symptoms of constriction, will primarily
depend on the location of abnormalities and degree of
constriction. Focal constriction, for example, at the level
of atrioventricular grooves or basal portion of the ventri￾cles, though visually not impressive may significantly
impede cardiac filling (Fig. 10) [see Additional file 5]
[60,61]. This urges for a scrutinized visualization of the
entire pericardium with CMR. Since cardiac constriction is
caused by decrease in pericardial compliance and not by
the pericardial thickness as such, taking the latter parame￾ter as an absolute criterion may create a diagnostic
dilemma in patients with haemodynamic findings of con￾striction without increased pericardial thickness. Up to
18% of patients with histologically proven constrictive
pericarditis have a normal or near normal pericardial
thickness (i.e. < 2 mm) (non or minimally thickened con￾strictive pericarditis) [62]. Moreover, in some patients
physical and haemodynamic features of constriction are
not apparent in their baseline state, but when rapidly fluid
challenged, they will present a typical haemodynamic
constrictive pericarditis pattern. This subgroup is called
occult constrictive pericarditis [56,63], and shows the
close interaction between cardiac filling status and physi￾cal properties of the surrounding pericardium.
Though beyond the scope of this paper, it should be
emphasized CMR has an increasingly important role in
investigating patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy
[11]. Myocardial enhancement patterns on LGE CMR may
be strongly indicative of specific myocardial infiltrative or
storage diseases, while T2*-weighted CMR may be used to
non-invasively depict iron deposition cardiomyopathy
[11].
Functional and Haemodynamic Abnormalities
The consequences of encasement of the heart by a rigid
pericardium are basically threefold, (a) dissociation
between intrathoracic and intracardiac pressure, isolating
the heart from normal respiratory changes in intrathoracic
pressure, (b) increased ventricular coupling, (c) increased
cardiac filling pressures with pressure equalization in all 4
cardiac chambers. Assessment of these effects is usually
performed by echocardiography and cardiac catheteriza￾tion, [1,2,46,64-67]. CMR, with the exception of intracar￾diac pressure measurements, may provide valuable
information too, and has the intrinsic advantage that find￾ings may be directly linked to morphologic abnormalities.
Velocity-encoded CMR typically shows a restrictive filling
pattern with an enhanced early filling, and decreased or
absent late filling, depending on the degree of pericardial
constriction and increased filling pressures. Also the
venous flow patterns may show restrictive physiology
with diminished or absent forward, or even reversed
systolic flow, and increased early diastolic forward flow
and late backflow. Constrictive pericarditis, in contrast
with restrictive myocarditis, is typically characterized by a
strong respiratory-related variation in cardiac filling (i.e.,
enhanced RV filling on inspiration, enhanced LV filling
on expiration)[65,66]. Real-time velocity CMR is a poten￾tial alternative to echo-Doppler to assess the effects of res￾piration on cardiac filling, though ideally slice-tracking
techniques are needed to compensate for through-plane
motion [67].

shows increased ventricular coupling with inspiratory septal 
inversion and increased right-sided septal motion at onset of 
expiration. At surgery, a heavily thickened, inflamed and con￾strictive pericardium was found.

should alert one to look for calcification of the pericardium.

Since the pressure difference between the ventricles (or
trans-septal pressure gradient) determines the position
and configuration of the ventricular septum, this informa￾tion can be used to determine the degree of ventricular
coupling (or ventricular interdependence) [9,10,48,68-
71]. Under normal loading conditions, due to a positive
left-to-right trans-septal pressure gradient, the septum has
a right-sided convex shape, and this shape is maintained
during the cardiac cycle and is minimally influenced by
respiration. The lack of pericardial stretch in constrictive
pericarditis leads to increased ventricular coupling, char￾acterized by septal flattening or inversion ("septal
bounce") on early diastolic ventricular filling [48].
Because of the dissociation between intrathoracic and int￾racardiac pressure, this pattern is strongly influenced by
respiration [2,70]. Septal abnormalities are most pro￾nounced at onset of inspiration and rapidly fade away,
while at onset of expiration an opposite (right-sided) sep￾tal shift occurs. CMR is appealing to functionally study
patients with a clinical suspicion of constrictive pericardi￾tis, and to visualize and quantify the degree of ventricular
coupling. Giorgi and associates, using breath-hold cine
CMR, reported early diastolic septal flattening or inver￾sion in the majority of constrictive pericarditis patients, a
pattern that was absent in restrictive cardiomyopathy
patients [60]. Abnormalities were most evident in the
basal septum, leading to a serpentine septal motion on
cardiac long-axis view. This pattern was not present if the
constrictive pericardium did not involve the right ventri￾cle [60,61]. With the advent of real-time CMR, the effect
of respiration on ventricular coupling could be dynami￾cally exploited [18]. Francone et al. analyzed septal shape
and position in patients with constrictive and inflamma￾tory pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy patients
[72,73]. Constrictive pericarditis patients showed the typ￾ical respiratory pattern of septal abnormalities (Fig. 11)
[see Additional file 6], while in restrictive cardiomyopathy
a pattern similar to healthy volunteers was found. Quan￾tification of the maximal respiratory septal excursion was
helpful to differentiate both groups of patients. Also in
patients with inflammatory pericarditis, increased septal
excursion was found likely reflecting the decreased com￾pliance of the inflamed pericardial layers. Real-time CMR
may be appealing to depict increased ventricular coupling
in patients with non or minimally thickened constrictive
pericarditis where the morphologic pericardial abnormal￾ities are minimal or absent.
Assessment of pericardial mobility is another potential
application of dynamic CMR, and is appealing to differen￾tiate normal from rigid pericardium (Fig. 8) [see Addi￾tional file 3]. The latter exhibits no or at most a limited
displacement, while normal pericardium slightly moves
during the cardiac cycle, often in synchronicity with the
underlying myocardial motion. Moreover, the restricted
expansion of the myocardium during cardiac filling abut￾ting against the stiff pericardium can be well appreciated.
These issues may be important in diagnosing patients
with minimally or non-thickened constrictive pericarditis.
CMR tagging may be of help to demonstrate extension of
the fibrocalcific process into the underlying myocardium.
Pericardial Masses
Primary tumors of the pericardium are rare entities, occur￾ring much less frequently than pericardial metastasis [74].
Pericardial mesothelioma is the most common primary
malignant tumor of the pericardium, and is often associ￾ated with hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. Other pri￾mary tumors include malignant fibrosarcoma,
angiosarcoma, and benign and malignant teratoma (Fig.
12) [see Additional file 7] [74-76]. CMR has the advantage
to accurately delineate the tumor implantation and deter￾mine its relation to contiguous anatomical structures. Tis￾sue characterization of pericardial tumors is often not
possible, exceptions being lipoma and liposarcoma,
which appear with high signal intensity due to their fatty
content. Pericardial metastases are, in most cases, second￾ary to lung or breast carcinoma, leukemia, or lymphoma
[77,78]. They are often associated with a large and hemor￾rhagic effusion that is disproportionate in size to the
amount of tumor present. Since metastatic pericardial
implants are often small, they might be difficult or even
not visible on CMR.
Other entities that have a mass-like appearance are peri￾cardial hematoma and pericardial gossypiboma. The
appearance and CMR signal characteristics of a pericardial
hematoma depends on the age of the collection [79]. Peri￾cardial gossypiboma or foreign body granuloma should

be considered in patients with previous cardiac surgery. In
the pericardium, it includes surgical sponges in the peri￾cardial space overlooked after pericardiectomy [11,79].
Conclusion
The added value of CMR compared to the standard tech￾niques used for assessment of patients with pericardial
diseases has substantially increased in recent years, ques￾tioning whether this technique should not be considered
the most appropriate non-invasive modality to study the
pericardium. Strong points in favor of CMR are the inte￾gration of anatomic and functional information within a
single examination, the ability for tissue characterization
and to determine the presence and degree of inflamma￾tion and activity of disease, and the value of CMR to accu￾rately assess the rest of the heart, in particular the
myocardium, helpful in the differential diagnosis, which
currently often remains a diagnostic challenge.
