Sir,
Use of voriconazole in candida retinitis
Candida retinitis is a sight-threatening ocular infection
that frequently occurs as a complication of candidemia.
Voriconazole is a recently introduced broad-spectrum
antifungal drug. To the best of our knowledge, its use in
candida retinitis and candida endophthalmitis has not
been reported before.
Case report
A 39-year-old ‘terminally ill’ woman with known
systemic candidiasis secondary to central venous line
infection was referred to the ophthalmic ‘on call team’.
She complained of bilateral simultaneous visual
deterioration of 1-week duration. Her past medical
history included hyperactive thyroid associated with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She had recently
undergone major gastrointestinal surgery for extensive
small bowel infarction and developed postoperative
sepsis. Ocular examination included bedside visual
acuity (VA), intraocular pressure measurement using
Perkins tonometer, direct ophthalmoscopy, and indirect
ophthalmoscopy. Slit-lamp examination was not
possible. Her corrected VA was 5/60 in the right eye and
6/60 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination was
unremarkable with absence of a relative afferent
pupillary defect and normal intraocular pressures.
Fundus examination of both eyes revealed multiple,
creamy white retinal lesions at the posterior pole (Figures
1 and 2). The overlying vitreous appeared clear, although
detailed slit-lamp evaluation was not possible. A
diagnosis of bilateral candida retinitis was made.
Candida had been cultured from her blood, urine and
sputum samples; however, information on drug
sensitivities was not available at the time of treatment.
Over the next few days, both general and ocular
condition deteriorated despite high doses of
intravenous fluconazole (800 mg daily for 2 weeks),
therefore it was decided to use oral Voriconazole
(4 mg/kg bodyweight) instead.
After 2 days, the retinal lesions were seen to decrease
in size. The patient was reviewed daily and 2 weeks later
the lesions were significantly smaller in size. The same
consultant ophthalmologist who had examined the
patient prior to treatment with voriconazole noted the
post-treatment clinical improvement. Unfortunately, the
patient demised due to cardio-respiratory arrest and
further follow-up including photographic
documentation of clinical improvement following use of
voriconazole was not possible.
Comment
Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection of intravenous
drug users and debilitated patients. Ocular candidiasis
can result from either haematogenous spread or direct
inoculation and is characterised by anterior and/or
posterior segment inflammation. Candida retinitis is
characterised by small, round, white slightly elevated
lesions that enlarge and extend into the vitreous
cavity-forming floating white colonies. Endophthalmitis

and severe retinal necrosis are seen in the advanced
stage.1 Predisposing factors for endogenous candida
endophthalmitis (ECE) include indwelling catheters,
bacterial sepsis, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic
use, and gastrointestinal surgery.2 In patients with
candidaemia, the reported incidence of ECE is 28–37%. In
spite of modern antibacterial, antimycotic, and operative
therapies, ECE has a very poor prognosis and is
associated with high mortality.
While use of amphotericin B and fluconazole in
invasive fungal infections is well documented, the
optimal management of candidal retinitis has not been
determined.3 Amphotericin penetrates poorly into ocular
fluids, is toxic, and must be given intravenously.
Fluconazole is a bis-triazole derivative proven highly
effective against candida. However, it is more effective in
preventive use than in therapeutic use against ECE. In
the treatment of patients with marked vitreous infiltrates
from ECE, pars plana vitrectomy, appropriate systemic,
and intravitreal antifungal medication are generally
recommended.
Voriconazole, a member of second-generation
antifungal triazoles, is a broad-spectrum antifungal
agent with demonstrated in vitro activity against azole
resistant species of Candida and Aspergillus.

Voriconazole has good oral and parenteral
bioavailability.5,6 Voriconazole exhibits nonlinear
pharmacokinetics. An apparent low volume of
distribution (2 l/kg) suggests widespread
distribution of the drug throughout the body tissues
and fluids. Voriconazole levels in the cerebrospinal
fluid appear to be the same as in serum. Information
on penetration to sites such as eye is limited. The
chief adverse effects reported are transient visual
disturbances, hepatotoxicity, and skin reactions. Visual
disturbances include enhanced light perception,
blurred vision, photophobia, and colour vision
changes.5,7 These have been reported in 23–35% of
patients. They generally occur within 30 min of
dosing and most frequently during the first week
of therapy.7 The majority of these events are mild
and resolve even if treatment is continued.
Lewis et al8 studied antifungal activity in an in vitro
model of Candidia catheter-related bloodstream
infection. They ranked overall antifungal activity as
amphotericin B 4 voriconazole 4 fluconazole.
Garbino et al4 reported successful treatment of
Paecilomyces lilacinus endophthalmitis with oral
voriconazole. Treatment with voriconazole was
considered when the patient failed to improve on
systemic fluconazole and oral itraconazole.
In our patient, the treatment was switched to oral
voriconazole following deterioration on intravenous
fluconazole.
Conclusion
Candida endophthalmitis can be the only manifestation
of disseminated candidiasis. Early recognition is essential
to prevent irreversible loss of vision. This case report
suggests that voriconazole may have a role as primary
treatment of endogenous candida endophthalmitis or in
patients resistant to fluconazole.

Sir,
Buphthalmos in trisomy 13
Trisomy 13 is the rarest and most severe of the three
viable autosomal trisomies, the others being 18 and 21. It
is also the chromosomal abnormality most commonly
associated with severe ocular defects, including
microphthalmos, iris coloboma, and retinal dysplasia.
The clinical picture of trisomy 13 was described in 1656
by Thomas Bartholin, and in 1960, Klaus Patau1 reported
the finding of an extra D chromosome in such a patient,
now known to be an additional chromosome 13. The
typical dysmorphic features include microcephaly,
hypertelorism, micrognathia, low-set ears, cutis aplasia,
cleft lip and palate, and polydactyly. Internal structural
defects affecting the heart and brain are common, with
high mortality in the neonatal period. Survivors exhibit
severe developmental delay.
Case report
The neonate we describe was a female born prematurely
by caesarean section at 28 weeks gestational age. The
mother, age 39 years, had pre-eclampsia and the foetus
was growth retarded, weighing just 630 g at birth. She
was noted to have micrognathia and microstomia, low￾set ears, bifid uvula, wide scalp defect between anterior
and posterior fontanelles, and bilateral talipes. Ocular
examination showed hyperteleorism. The globes were
buphthalmic and bilateral corneal stromal oedema was
present, obscuring fundal detail. Examination with the
indirect ophthalmoscope revealed aniridia and some
evidence of an iris root only. Intraocular pressures by
Perkins applanation tonometry were 30 mmHg OD and
40 mmHg OS. Treatment with topical dorzolamide was
commenced; however, before the eyes could be
re-evaluated, a diagnosis of Patau’s syndrome was
confirmed cytogenetically, and in view of severe
respiratory difficulty all treatment was withdrawn.
Comment
In his original description of a patient with trisomy 13,
Patau states ‘no organised ocular tissue could be seen or
palpated’. Case series detailing the ocular characteristics
of trisomy 13 have since been published.2–4 The most
frequent findings are microphthalmia, coloboma of the
iris and ciliary body, and retinal dysplasia. Other
abnormalities described include PPHV, cataract,
cyclopia, and primary aphakia. We have found four
previously reported cases of congenital glaucoma
associated with trisomy 13.
The first such description is by Keith4 in a review of
ocular manifestations and histopathology in 10 cases of
trisomy 13. He noted bilateral buphthalmos in one case,
gestational age not stated. No iris defect is described.
Hinzpeter et al5 reported a trisomy 13 neonate born at 35
weeks gestational age with corneal diameters of
15  15 mm bilaterally, and IOPs of 33 mmHg OD and
50 mmHg OS. Histological examination demonstrated
anterior inserted iris root but normal iris leaf. Lichter and
Schmickel6 described a trisomic infant born at term, who
developed corneal enlargement and clouding at 4
months of age. IOPs were 59 and 40 mmHg. The iris
appeared normal. In 1981, Reardon et al7 reported an
unusual trisomy 13 mosaic, the predominant cell line
being trisomic for the distal portion of the long arm of
chromosome 13. Born at 37 weeks gestation, ocular
examination showed left microphthalmos and iris
coloboma. Glaucoma of the right eye was recognised at 1
year with buphthalmos. The right iris was atrophic with
stromal defects inferiorly. IOP was 50 mmHg OD,
15 mmHg OS.
The case of trisomy 13 we have described is notable
both for established buphthalmos at just 28 weeks
gestational age, and the lack of iris. The early delivery of
this infant tells us that buphthalmos can take place as
early as the second trimester, contrasting with
presentation at 1 year of age in the case of the trisomy 13
mosaic. Mosaicism was excluded in our case on the basis
of a 10 cell karyotype, coupled with the severity of the
phenotype.
The second unusual finding, the almost complete lack
of iris tissue, has not been described in the literature in
association with trisomy 13, nor is it a feature of the
above cases of glaucoma in trisomy 13. Iris coloboma,
however, is a typical feature and while we have not
excluded specific secondary chromosomal defects, a
severe colobomatous-type defect would seem the most
likely aetiology.
A normal chromosome 13 complement seems to be
essential for the proper development of the eye, and
while trisomy 13 often results in a microphthalmic eye
at birth, it can exceptionally give rise to buphthalmos.
Hoepner and Yanoff8 emphasised a characteristic
‘dysembryogenesis’ of the anterior segment in a
histological review of trisomy 13 patients, finding
microphthalmic eyes with immature drainage angles. We
speculate that if the drainage structures are
disproportionately underdeveloped compared with the
