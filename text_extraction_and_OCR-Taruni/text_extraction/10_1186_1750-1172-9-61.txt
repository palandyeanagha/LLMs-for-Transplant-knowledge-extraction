Abstract
Background: Transthyretin amyloidosis is a systemic disorder caused by amyloid deposits formed by misfolded
transthyretin monomers. Two main forms exist: hereditary and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis, the former
associated with transthyretin gene mutations. There are several disease manifestations; however, gastrointestinal
complications are common in the hereditary form. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and
distribution of gastrointestinal manifestations in transthyretin amyloidosis and to evaluate their impact on the
patients’ nutritional status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Methods: The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) is the first global, multicenter, longitudinal,
observational survey that collects data on patients with transthyretin amyloidosis and the registry is sponsored by
Pfizer Inc. This study presents baseline data from patients enrolled in THAOS as of June 2013. The modified body
mass index (mBMI), in which BMI is multiplied with serum albumin, was used to assess the nutritional status and
the EQ-5D Index was used to assess HRQoL.
Results: Data from 1579 patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and 160 patients with wild-type
transthyretin amyloidosis were analyzed. Sixty-three percent of those with the hereditary form and 15% of those
with the wild-type form reported gastrointestinal symptoms at enrollment. Unintentional weight loss and early
satiety were the most frequent symptoms, reported by 32% and 26% of those with transthyretin gene mutations,
respectively. Early-onset patients (<50 years) reported gastrointestinal complaints more frequently than those with a
late onset (p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in patients with the V30M mutation than
in those with other mutations (p < 0.001). For patients with predominantly cardiac complications, the prevalence of
gastrointestinal manifestations was not evidently higher than that expected in the general population. Both upper
and lower gastrointestinal symptoms were significant negative predictors of mBMI and the EQ-5D Index Score
(p < 0.001 for all).
Conclusions: Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and
had a significant negative impact on their nutritional status and HRQoL. However, patients with wild-type transthyretin
amyloidosis or transthyretin mutations associated with predominantly cardiac complications did not show an increased
prevalence of gastrointestinal disturbances.

Background
Transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) amyloidosis is a systemic
disorder with two main forms; hereditary and wild-type
(wt) ATTR amyloidosis. The hereditary form is caused
by transthyretin (TTR) gene mutations and is sometimes
referred to as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) or
familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC). Wt-ATTR
amyloidosis is also known as senile systemic amyloidosis
(SSA) or senile cardiac amyloidosis (SCA), due to its late
onset and primarily cardiac manifestations.
Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is a rare autosomal
dominant condition that is present all over the world
with endemic areas in Sweden, Portugal, Brazil and
Japan. More than 100 different TTR mutations have
been observed, however, the V30M (Valine substituted
for Methionine at position 30) mutation is the most
common form in endemic areas [1,2]. The V122I muta￾tion is probably the most common variant worldwide
with a prevalence of about 4% in African-Americans [3].
TTR is a tetrameric protein that functions as a trans￾porter of thyroxin and retinol binding protein and is
mainly produced by the liver [4,5]. Increasing age and
amyloidogenic TTR mutations lead to a decreased stabil￾ity of the TTR tetramer, making it more prone to dis￾sociate into non-native monomers. These monomers, in
turn, aggregate into beta structured fibrils that form
extracellular amyloid deposits [6,7].
ATTR amyloidosis is often classified as polyneuro￾pathic, cardiac or mixed type, depending on the clinical
appearance. In addition, oculoleptomeningeal and lepto￾meningeal types with symptoms of eye and central ner￾vous system malfunction have been described [8-12].
However, this is an entirely artificial classification since
more than 50% of all mutations are reported to produce
cardiac involvement [13] and for patients with the V30M
mutation, cardiac involvement is age dependent with
cardiomyopathy predominantly occurring in late-onset
cases (≥50 years of age).
In hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, GI disturbances play
an important role in the patients’ morbidity and mortal￾ity [14,15]. Virtually all Swedish V30M patients develop
GI complications during the course of the disease [16],
whereas GI symptoms are less frequent for other geno￾types [17]. In some cases, GI symptoms are present even
before the onset of the peripheral polyneuropathy and
initial symptoms are often constipation or nausea and
vomiting. Diarrhea can also be the presenting symptom
[18,19], and in later stages of the disease the diarrhea
usually becomes continuous, often coupled with fecal in￾continence and severe malnutrition [16,20].
A liver transplantation ceases the synthesis of mutated
TTR and thereby halts disease progression. Liver trans￾plantation is currently the standard treatment for heredi￾tary ATTR amyloidosis; however, not all patients are
suitable candidates [15,21-23]. Fortunately, alternative
treatments are emerging: tafamidis has been shown to
stabilize mutated TTR and to reduce disease progression
[24] and has been approved in Europe and Japan. More￾over, the NSAID diflunisal has demonstrated efficacy in
a controlled trial [25] and gene therapy, aiming to re￾duce TTR production, is currently under evaluation in
clinical trials [26].
The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey
(THAOS) is a large global, longitudinal, observational
patient registry designed to better understand and follow
the progression of ATTR amyloidosis. The primary aim
of the present study was to explore the prevalence of GI
manifestations in SSA and in different types of heredi￾tary ATTR amyloidosis, based on enrollment data from
THAOS. A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of
the GI symptoms on the patients’ nutritional status and
health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Methods
THAOS
The design and methodology of THAOS has previously
been described in detail [17,27].
Briefly, THAOS is an international, longitudinal, ob￾servational registry that collects data on the progression
of ATTR amyloidosis [28] and is sponsored by Pfizer
Inc. The registry was established in December 2007 and
is open to adults (≥18 years of age) with ATTR amyloid￾osis and to asymptomatic TTR-variant carriers. Prior to
the enrollment of patients in THAOS, the participating
sites obtained approval from their local ethical review
board/institutional review board. All patients provided
written informed consent and research was in accord￾ance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients
were consecutively enrolled into THAOS by each of the
participating sites. De-identified data obtained during
routine clinical practice were entered into THAOS using
an internet-based application.
Clinical symptoms and assessments
Enrollment data collected in THAOS as of 6 June 2013
were used for all analyses. Symptoms were recorded as
present or absent at the time of enrollment into THAOS.
The duration of symptoms was calculated retrospectively
from information provided by the patients at the time of
enrollment.
The GI symptoms checklist included the following
items: early satiety, nausea, vomiting, constipation, alter￾nating diarrhea/constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontin￾ence and unintentional weight loss. Early satiety, nausea
and vomiting were regarded as upper GI symptoms,
whereas constipation, alternating diarrhea/constipation,
diarrhea and fecal incontinence were regarded as lower
GI symptoms.

The modified body mass index (mBMI), in which the
BMI (kg/m2
) was multiplied with serum albumin (g/L) to
compensate for edema, was used to assess the patients’
nutritional status. mBMI values below 750 kg/m2
∙g/L were
regarded as underweight and values below 600 kg/m2
∙g/L
were regarded as severely malnourished [14,15].
HRQoL was measured using the validated EuroQoL
Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire which includes
a descriptive and visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment
of the present health status. The EQ-5D Index Score
was calculated using a predefined scoring algorithm and
full health is represented by a score of 1 [29,30].
Statistical analysis
SAS 9.1.3 (Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses.
Comparisons between cohorts and subgroups were car￾ried out using the one-way ANOVA for the continuous
variables. The chi-square test was used for categorical
variables. Multiple regression analyses were carried out
to identify potential predictors of GI symptoms, mBMI
and the EQ-5D Index Score.
Results
A total of 1744 patients had been enrolled in THAOS as
of 6 June 2013. Seventeen countries participated and the
largest contributors were: Portugal (46% of the patients),
United States (13%), Italy (7%), France, Germany and
Brazil (6% each), Sweden (5%) and Japan (4%). A major￾ity of the patients carried TTR mutations (90.8%),
mainly the V30M mutation (73.8%); however, a substan￾tial number of patients had other genotypes or SSA. The
most frequent TTR mutations and their associated clin￾ical manifestations are presented in Table 1. Median dur￾ation of disease at enrollment in THAOS was 4.9 years
for those with TTR mutations. Of the symptomatic
patients with TTR mutations, 201 (18%) had undergone
liver transplantation prior to enrollment. Further charac￾teristics of the patients included in the analyses are out￾lined in Figure 1.
GI symptoms
Fifty-nine percent of all the patients in THAOS reported
at least one GI symptom. Unintentional weight loss was
the most frequently reported symptom (28.3%), followed
by early satiety (25.1%) and alternating diarrhea/consti￾pation (22.9%). Fecal incontinence (5.6%) was the least
common symptom. The distribution of the individual GI
symptoms in patients with hereditary and wt-ATTR
amyloidosis is presented in Table 2.
With regard to genotypic differences, GI complications
were found to be less common for some mutations,
mainly those associated with predominantly cardiac
manifestations (Table 1). Furthermore, GI symptoms

were generally more prevalent in V30M than in non￾V30M patients (69.3% vs. 56.0%, p < 0.001); (Table 3).
Since patients with the TTR V122I, I68L and L111M
mutations exhibited mostly cardiac complications and a
prevalence of GI symptoms similar to that of the general
population; they were excluded from the non-V30M
group. For the same reason, subsequent analyses focused
on patients with TTR mutations.
No significant gender related difference in overall GI
symptom prevalence was found (females 63.1%, males
62.9%, p = 0.967). However, unintentional weight loss
was significantly more common in males than in females
(34.9% vs. 27.3%, p = 0.007). Numerical differences in
symptom prevalence between men and women were also
found for early satiety (28.6% vs. 23.7%, p = 0.067) and
nausea (15.2% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.061), but these did not
reach statistical significance.
Patients with an early disease onset (<50 years) re￾ported GI symptoms more frequently than those with a
late onset (70.3% vs. 49.6%, p < 0.001), yet, no significant
differences were observed for constipation and fecal in￾continence (Table 4).
After dividing the patients into groups with a disease
duration of <5 years, 5–10 years and >10 years, respect￾ively, the prevalence of GI symptoms was found to be
significantly higher in later stages of the disease (57.2%
vs. 69.2% vs. 75.1%, p < 0.001). Detailed data on the indi￾vidual symptoms in relation to duration of disease are
presented in Figure 2.
Patients carrying the TTR V30M mutation were in￾cluded in a multiple regression analysis of factors associ￾ated with GI symptoms. Significant associations were
found for duration of disease (OR 1.073, 95% CI 1.034-
1.114), liver transplantation (OR 4.358, 95% CI 2.460-
7.720) and Swedish origin (OR 0.315, 95% CI 0.173-0.572),
whereas no significant association was found for male
gender (OR 1.322, 95% CI 0.962-1.818), early-onset (OR
1.446, 95% CI 0.996-2.099) or Portuguese origin (OR 1.414,
95% CI 0.973-2.055).
Nutritional status
The impact of the individual GI symptoms on nutri￾tional status in V30M and non-V30M patients, respect￾ively, is presented in Figure 3. In both groups, patients
with a given symptom generally had lower mBMI values
compared to those without the symptom.
In addition, the upper and lower GI symptom categor￾ies, age at onset, duration of disease and liver transplant￾ation were all significant predictors of mBMI in simple
regression analyses. However, in a multiple regression
analysis, only the upper and lower GI symptom categor￾ies and duration of disease remained significant predic￾tors (Table 5). The outcome was equivalent when the
individual GI symptoms were used as independent vari￾ables instead of the symptom categories.

HRQoL
The impact of the individual GI symptoms on HRQoL
in V30M and non-V30M patients, respectively, is pre￾sented in Figure 4. As for the nutritional status, patients
with a given symptom generally showed reduced EQ-5D
Index Scores.
Multiple regression analysis revealed that the upper
and lower GI symptom categories, age at onset and dur￾ation of disease were all negatively associated with the
EQ-5D Index Score, whereas a significant positive asso￾ciation was found for liver transplant at enrollment
(Table 6). The outcome remained unchanged when the
individual GI symptoms were used as independent
variables.
Moreover, a weak but significant correlation was found
between mBMI and the EQ-5D Index Score (r2 = 0.217,
p < 0.001).
Discussion
This is the first detailed analysis of GI manifestations in
patients with ATTR amyloidosis, based on data from
THAOS, and a large number (n = 1744) of subjects were
available for the study.
GI symptoms were generally common and often oc￾curred early after disease onset. However, patients with
SSA and TTR mutations associated with predominantly
cardiac complications, i.e. the V122I, I68L and L111M var￾iants, reported GI symptoms with prevalence similar to
that of the general population (i.e., between 10 and 25%
[31-35]). Therefore, subsequent analyses were focused on
patients with mainly non-cardiac manifestations.
Unintentional weight loss was the most frequently re￾ported symptom. However, weight loss is multifactorial
and a marked loss of weight has been observed in pa￾tients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis even before the
onset of GI or other symptoms [36]. The mechanisms
behind this weight loss remain unexplained, yet early sa￾tiety could be a contributing factor, as it often occurs
early in the disease and may negatively affect the pa￾tients’ energy intake. An increased metabolism, due to
inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress caused by
the amyloid formation and deposition [37,38], could also
contribute to the loss of weight.
Early satiety was the second most common symptom
and early satiety, as well as nausea and vomiting, are
classic symptoms of gastric retention, which has been
shown to be common in patients with hereditary ATTR
amyloidosis [39,40]. As expected, fecal incontinence was
the least frequently reported symptom as it occurs in
late stages of the disease and as the median duration of
disease at inclusion in THAOS was merely 4.9 years.
In the general population, functional GI disorders are
more common in females [31-33] and hence, a female
preponderance of GI symptoms was expected. However,
no significant gender related difference was observed for
any GI symptom and there was no association between
gender and GI symptoms, nutritional status or HRQoL.
GI symptoms were found to be more frequent in
V30M than in non-V30M patients (mutations with
mainly cardiac manifestations excluded), which is con￾sistent with previous reports of less frequent autonomic
neuropathy in patients with non-V30M mutations [1].
In addition, early-onset patients generally reported GI
symptoms more frequently than late-onset cases, which
is consistent with previous findings [41,42]. Yet, there
was no significant difference in constipation between the
groups and this might reflect an early onset of constipa￾tion in the late-onset group [19]. The mechanisms be￾hind the phenotypic differences between early and late￾onset cases remain unclear, but late-onset cases generally
have more cardiac complications and an amyloid fibril
composition similar to that of SSA [5].
Since the Swedish and Portuguese V30M populations ex￾hibit phenotypic differences, especially with respect to age
at onset and penetrance [43-45], Swedish and Portuguese
origin, respectively, were included as predictor variables
in a multiple regression analysis of factors associated
with GI symptoms. Swedish patients were less likely to
suffer from GI symptoms than non-Swedish patients, but

symptoms in patients with a disease duration of <5 years, 5–10
years and >10 years, respectively. A majority of the patients suffered
from GI symptoms even at early stages of the disease, whereas the
reported prevalence of GI symptoms in the general population
usually ranges from 10 to 25%. Unintentional weight loss, early
satiety and alternating diarrhea/constipation were the most common
symptoms in all disease stages. The symptom prevalence increased
significantly with disease duration for all symptoms (p < 0.002, for all),
except for early satiety (p = 0.114).

no significant association was found between age at on￾set and GI symptoms, indicating that age is not the fac￾tor behind the difference in GI symptom prevalence
between Swedish and Portuguese patients.
As expected, the prevalence of GI symptoms was sig￾nificantly higher for patients enrolled in later stages of
their disease. However, it should be noted that as much
as 57% of the patients with the shortest disease duration
(<5 years) reported GI symptoms. Early satiety was, after
unintentional weight loss, the most common symptom
in this group and since it did not increase with disease
duration, it is probably the earliest GI symptom of the
disease. Fecal incontinence, on the other hand, was in￾frequent in early stages (with a prevalence similar to that
of the general population [46-49]), but the prevalence in￾creased significantly with disease duration.
Not surprisingly, both upper and lower GI symptoms
were significant negative predictors of the patients’ nu￾tritional status. The duration of disease also showed a
negative association with the nutritional status, which
probably reflects the development of multiple GI com￾plications and a marked peripheral polyneuropathy.
All GI symptoms were negatively associated with the
EQ-5D Index Score and, expectedly, fecal incontinence
had the most profound effect on the patients’ HRQoL.
Early disease onset also had a negative impact on the
EQ-5D Index Score, which might reflect the higher
prevalence of GI symptoms in this group. Not surpris￾ingly, longer duration of disease was associated with a
poorer HRQoL as well.
Eighteen percent of the symptomatic patients with
TTR mutations had undergone liver transplantation
prior to enrollment and these patients have a more
stable disease than the non-transplanted. Liver trans￾plantation was included as a variable in the multiple

Figure 3 Impact of gastrointestinal symptoms on the nutritional status in patients with TTR mutations. For each gastrointestinal symptom,
patients with a given symptom were compared with those without the symptom. In the V30M group, each symptom had a significant negative
impact on nutritional status, whereas in the non-V30M group, all symptoms but constipation had a significant negative impact. The modified body
mass index (mBMI), calculated by multiplying BMI by serum albumin, was used to assess the nutritional status. Extreme mBMI values (<400 or >2500)
were excluded and the TTR V122I, I68L and L111M mutations were excluded from the non-V30M group; p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
Data are presented as box and whisker plots showing median (horizontal line), interquartile range (box), mean (circle) and range of measurements

regression analyses and, expectedly, liver transplantation
prior to enrollment showed a significant positive associ￾ation with HRQoL. The transplanted V30M patients were,
however, more likely to suffer from GI symptoms, which
may be a consequence of post-operative complications.
The mechanisms behind the frequently occurring GI
disturbances in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloid￾osis are not fully elucidated, although malfunction of the
autonomic and enteric nervous systems, including a de￾pletion of the GI neuroendocrine cells and interstitial
cells of Cajal, seems to be of importance [40,50-55]. Bac￾terial overgrowth in the small intestine and bile acid mal￾absorption also contribute to the GI symptoms [56,57].
In conclusion, the present study supports previous
data of a high frequency of GI complications, even at
early stages, in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloid￾osis. However, the prevalence of GI symptoms for SSA
and mutations predominantly associated with cardiac
complications was not different from that reported by
the general population. GI symptoms were found to be
more common in early-onset patients and increased
with disease duration. Both upper and lower GI symp￾toms were negatively associated with the patients' nutri￾tional status and HRQoL. These findings underscore the
importance of a thorough evaluation of the GI function
in patients with TTR mutations and should encourage
further studies on the phenotypic differences related to
genotype, age at onset, and geographic origin.
Limitations
THAOS is a large international registry involving several
sites and physicians with different specialties. The GI
symptoms and their duration were registered in THAOS
by investigators at the individual sites as reported by the
patients. Hence, the registration procedure was not

Figure 4 Impact of gastrointestinal symptoms on HRQoL in patients with TTR mutations. For each gastrointestinal symptom, patients with
a given symptom were compared with those without the symptom. In the V30M group, each symptom had a significant negative impact on
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), whereas in the non-V30M group, all symptoms except for alternating diarrhea/constipation showed a significant
negative impact. The EQ-5D Index Score was used to assess the HRQoL and full health is represented by a score of 1. The TTR V122I, I68L and L111M
mutations were excluded from the non-V30M group; p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Data are presented as box and whisker plots
showing median (horizontal line), interquartile range (box), mean (circle) and range of measurements (whisker).

identical across sites and the accuracy of symptom dur￾ation data is dependent on the patients’ ability to recol￾lect the onset of their symptoms.
Only 677 out of the 1219 symptomatic patients en￾rolled had biopsy-proven hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.
The patients without biopsy-proven disease were en￾rolled at sites in endemic areas with a high incidence of
the disease, where a histopathological diagnosis is not
routinely sought for.
The nutritional status assessed by mBMI is dependent
not only on the height-weight ratio, but also on serum
albumin. Thus, edema caused by hypoalbuminemia will
not lead to an increase in mBMI as it would do in BMI.
However, hypoalbuminemia due to liver failure or urin￾ary protein losses will result in a decrease in mBMI and
the patients’ liver and kidney function was not accounted
for in this analysis.
GI symptoms are common side effects of several drugs
and, unfortunately, we had no possibility to adjust for
the patients’ medication in this study.
