Abstract
Rationale: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Calcium-activated Chloride Conductance
(CaCC) each play critical roles in maintaining normal hydration of epithelial surfaces including the airways and colon. TGF￾beta is a genetic modifier of cystic fibrosis (CF), but how it influences the CF phenotype is not understood.
Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that TGF-beta potently downregulates chloride-channel function and expression in
two CF-affected epithelia (T84 colonocytes and primary human airway epithelia) compared with proteins known to be
regulated by TGF-beta.
Measurements and Main Results: TGF-beta reduced CaCC and CFTR-dependent chloride currents in both epithelia
accompanied by reduced levels of TMEM16A and CFTR protein and transcripts. TGF-beta treatment disrupted normal
regulation of airway-surface liquid volume in polarized primary human airway epithelia, and reversed F508del CFTR
correction produced by VX-809. TGF-beta effects on the expression and activity of TMEM16A, wtCFTR and corrected F508del
CFTR were seen at 10-fold lower concentrations relative to TGF-beta effects on e-cadherin (epithelial marker) and vimentin
(mesenchymal marker) expression. TGF-beta downregulation of TMEM16A and CFTR expression were partially reversed by
Smad3 and p38 MAPK inhibition, respectively.
Conclusions: TGF-beta is sufficient to downregulate two critical chloride transporters in two CF-affected tissues that
precedes expression changes of two distinct TGF-beta regulated proteins. Our results provide a plausible mechanism for CF￾disease modification by TGF-beta through effects on CaCC.

Introduction
Regulation of chloride transport is critical to the normal
hydration and function of a variety of epithelia, including many of
those affected in cystic fibrosis (CF) [1]. Loss of cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein function
disrupts chloride transport, with reduced or absent PKA-activated
chloride conductance (through CFTR). This loss of CFTR
function is frequently associated with an increase in chloride
transport through the Calcium activated Chloride Conductance
(CaCC) [2]. Research over the past twenty-five years has taught us
much about CFTR, which is a chloride and bicarbonate channel
that is regulated by regional cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) and numerous membrane protein interactions [1,3–5].
Much less is known about CaCC which is regulated through
surface P2Y2 purinergic receptors and ATP [2,6]. While there is
not full agreement regarding the chloride channel identity of
CaCC [7], TMEM16A (anoctamin 1) is a recently identified
calcium-activated chloride channel that is expressed in many
organs affected in CF and may contribute to CaCC [8]. A leading
model of CF suggests that function of CaCC can substitute in part
for CFTR, providing a redundant chloride-transport pathway to
protect organs from lost CFTR activity [9–11]. Indeed, cftr-/- mice
are largely protected from a spontaneous CF lung phenotype, with
upregulated CaCC as a postulated protective mechanism [11].
More recent studies provide evidence that changes in CaCC
activity can influence the CF phenotype in human subjects. For
example, CaCC downregulated by estradiol may contribute to
accelerated decline in lung function in post-pubescent CF females
[12]. In addition, downregulation of CaCC during respiratory
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 9 | e106842

viral infections may disrupt mucociliary clearance in the CF
airway and contribute to pulmonary exacerbations [13,14]. These
data support the notion that changes in CaCC activity are directly
relevant to the CF phenotype.
TGF-beta is an established genetic modifier in CF [15–18], but
it is unclear how it influences CF disease. It is a pleotropic
signaling molecule that is often upregulated under conditions of
tissue injury and repair, and pathologic upregulation of TGF-beta
is a known contributor to fibrogenic diseases [19,20]. TGF-beta
can drive changes in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal
genes in differentiated epithelia [19,21] that result in a motile
fibroblastoid phenotype [20]. This may be an important aspect of
tissue healing and regeneration, but dysregulation can lead to
tumorigenesis and tissue fibrosis [19–24].
Previous studies have provided evidence that TGF-beta
downregulates CFTR expression in polarized T84 human
colonocytes (T84 cells) and in primary human-airway epithelial
cells (HAECs) through p38 MAPK- and Smad-2/3-dependent
mechanisms, respectively [25,26]. How this could influence the CF
phenotype, where CFTR function is low or absent, is not clear. In
contrast, relationships between TGF-beta, CaCC, and
TMEM16A have not been examined, nor have the simultaneous
effects of TGF-beta on ion transporters and other TGF-beta￾regulated processes in CF-affected epithelia.
In this report we examined TGF-beta effects on these chloride
transport pathways in T84 cells and HAECs, which are two well￾established model systems to study CaCC and CFTR. We also
examined dose/response relationships between TGF-beta and
TMEM16A, CFTR and proteins known to be regulated by TGF￾beta (e-cadherin, vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin). TGF-beta
was sufficient to suppress calcium-activated and cAMP-activated
chloride transport, to inhibit the expression of TMEM16A and
CFTR, and to reverse F508del CFTR correction produced by
VX-809 treatment (a known corrector of F508del CFTR
trafficking to the plasma membrane that is currently in clinical
trials) [27,28]. These effects were observed at TGF-beta concen￾trations below those necessary to affect the expression of e￾cadherin and vimentin. The TGF-beta effects on TMEM16A and
CFTR expression were partially reversed by Smad3 and p38
MAPK inhibition, respectively. These data support the hypothesis
that TGF-beta can modify the CF phenotype through broad
downregulation of chloride transporters in CF-affected epithelia
via distinct signaling pathways.
Methods
Cell culture
T84 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA),
grown in T75 flasks (Costar, St. Louis, MO), seeded onto collagen￾coated Transwell filters (6.5 mm; Corning, Inc., Corning, NY),
and maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Resistance was monitored using
EVOM2 (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and cells
were studied when resistance was at 500–1000 V.cm2
. Cells were
serum starved (0.1% FBS) for 24 h prior to TGF-beta exposure.
HAECs obtained from the University of North Carolina Airway
Cell Core (under the direction of Dr. Scott Randell) were isolated
from donor or recipient lungs that were cryopreserved at passage 1
and cultured as previously described [29]. Briefly, HAECs were
cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM; Lonza,
Hopkinton, MA) on Purecol-coated tissue-culture dishes (Ad￾vanced Biomatrix, San Diego, CA) until 80–90% confluent, then
passaged and plated onto Transwell-Clear permeable supports
(0.4 mm pore size; Corning, Inc.) coated with type IV collagen
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To correct F508del CFTR
trafficking, F508del/F508del HAECs were treated with VX-809
(3 mM; Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) for 48 h prior to study
[27,28].
Ion transport
Short-circuit current (Isc) and resistance were measured using
Acquire and Analyze 2.3 software (San Diego, CA) as previously
described [30]. In T84 cells, CFTR was activated with forskolin/
IBMX (10/100 mM), and the CFTR current was augmented by
basolateral stimulation of potassium channels with carbachol
(100 mM, causing cell hyperpolarization to drive anion exit). This
is a well-established method to maximize the detection of CFTR in
the luminal membrane of colonic epithelia [31–33]. In HAECs,
CFTR was activated with forskolin/IBMX (10/100 mM) and then
potentiated with genistein (50 mM). Calcium-activated chloride
currents were stimulated by ionomycin (2 mM) followed by
basolateral carbachol (100 mM) in both T84 cells and HAECs.
CFTRinh172 [34] and tannic acid [7] were used to block CFTR
and CaCC currents, respectively. For permeabilization studies,
50 mg/ml nystatin was added to the basolateral membrane as
previously described [35].
Airway Surface Liquid (ASL) measurements
ASL volume was measured by the method published by Harvey
and colleagues with minor modifications [36].
Immunoblot
Immunoblot was performed using methods similar to those
previously described [30]. Primary antibodies (mouse anti-CFTR
570 1:4000 or rabbit anti-TMEM16A 1:1000; rabbit anti-e￾cadherin 1:1000 or mouse anti-vimentin 1:1000; mouse anti-alpha
smooth muscle actin) were added to the blots and incubated
overnight at 4uC, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second￾ary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit 1:200,000)
were applied in PBS. Immunoreactivity was detected by chemi￾luminescence (SuperSignal West Fretmo, Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL) and quantitated using NIH Image software
(Bethesda, MD).
Real time RT-PCR
TaqMan One Step RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems Life Tech￾nologies, Grand Island, NY) was used to quantify CFTR and
TMEM16A mRNA transcripts using ‘‘Assays on Demand’’ Gene
Expression Products (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies). RT￾PCR was performed using methods similar to those previously
described [30].
cAMP and calcium measurements
See Online Data (Figure S2).
Immunoflourscence
See Online Data (Figure S4).
Statistical analyses
Paired and unpaired t-tests or ANOVA (as appropriate) were
used to compare continuous data, including Isc, densitometry, and
PCR, using Sigmastat software (San Jose, CA). An alpha value of
0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance of obtained
P values.
TGF-Beta Downregulates Chloride Transporters
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 September 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 9 | e106842

Results
TGF-beta downregulates calcium and cAMP- stimulated
chloride currents in T84 cells and HAECs
Previous reports indicate that TGF-beta treatment downregu￾lates CFTR expression and activity in T84 cells and HAECs
[25,26,37]. We tested the hypothesis that TGF-beta would
downregulate the expression and function of both CaCC and
CFTR using published TGF-beta exposure. Representative
control experiments (i.e., no TGF-beta exposure) are shown in
Figure S1A-D, and summarized results of TGF-beta effects on
chloride channel function are shown in Figure 1A–D. TGF-beta
treatment (10 ng/ml) of T84 cells for 48 h dramatically reduced
currents through CaCC following ionomycin + basolateral
carbachol (2 mM and 100 mM, respectively, P,0.001), and CFTR
currents following forskolin/IBMX + basolateral carbachol (10/
100 mM and 100 mM, respectively, P= 0.003) relative to control
conditions (Figure 1A and B). The inhibitory effects of TGF-beta
on chloride conductance persisted following basolateral membrane
permeabilization with nystatin, confirming that TGF-beta inhib￾ited both apical plasma-membrane chloride channels. Similar
experiments conducted in HAECs are shown in Figure 1C and D.
TGF-beta treatment for 48 h inhibited both CaCC activity
following ionomycin + basolateral carbachol (P= 0.041) and
CFTR currents following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX +
apical genistein (P= 0.006) relative to control conditions. These
inhibitory effects also persisted in HAECs following basolateral
membrane permeabilization with nystatin. The inhibitory effects
of TGF-beta were less pronounced for CaCC compared with
those for CFTR-dependent currents. CaCC-dependent currents
were reduced 66% and 71.8% in T84 cells and HAECs,
respectively. In contrast, CFTR activity following TGF-beta
treatment was reduced 93.2% and 98% in the two cell types.
While not a direct goal of our studies, we also observed that
amiloride-sensitive currents were potently reduced by TGF-beta
treatment of HAECs (from 211.362.3 to 20.87560.25 mA/cm2
,
P,0.001). Since ENaC expression is typically low/absent in T84
cells, we focused the remainder of our studies on CaCC and
CFTR across the two cell types.
Complementary immunoblots of TMEM16A and CFTR
confirmed that expression of both chloride channels was reduced
in both T84 cells and HAECs after 48 h of TGF-beta treatment
(Figure 2A and B - T84 cells, Figure 2C and D - HAECs). The
effects of TGF-beta on protein levels of both channels (by
densitometry) generally corresponded with the effects observed on
Isc. TGF-beta reduced TMEM16A expression 67% and 59% in
T84 cells and HAECs, respectively, compared with reductions of
CFTR detection by 74% and 83% in the two cell types.
In addition to downregulated chloride-channel function and
protein levels (Figures 1 and 2), TGF-beta also reduced
TMEM16A and CFTR transcription in both cell types (Fig￾ure 3A–D). Treatment with TGF-beta produced maximal reduc￾tions of TMEM16A and CFTR transcript levels within 48 h
relative to untreated cells, with no further reduction following 72 h
of exposure. The effects of TGF-beta on TMEM16A and CFTR
transcripts were less pronounced relative to effects on protein
levels and function of both chloride channels. For T84 cells,
transcript levels for TMEM16A and CFTR were reduced
approximately 40–50% relative to untreated controls. For
HAECs, CFTR transcripts were more sensitive to TGF-beta
exposure (,70% reduction observed within 48 h) than
TMEM16A transcripts (reduced ,40%) relative to control
conditions. These effects of TGF-beta on chloride transport and
channel expression are summarized in Table 1.
TGF-beta disrupts ASL regulation in polarized HAECs
The ASL volume of polarized HAECs has been shown to be
auto regulated by several ion transporters, including ENaC,
CFTR, and CaCC [10,38]. To examine the effect of TGF-beta on
this critical airway epithelial function, polarized HAECs (non-CF)
cultured ex-vivo for six weeks were treated with TGF-beta (10 ng/
ml) or vehicle for 72 h following a 20 ml apical bolus with media
(Figure 4). Under control conditions, the ASL volume dropped to
,12 ml within 72 h. In the presence of TGF-beta, autoregulation
of the ASL volume was reduced over 72 h of treatment compared
with the control conditions. In parallel, TGF-beta exposure
(10 ng/ml) significantly increased monolayer resistance in both
cell types over 72 h of exposure [T84 cells control = 556.6V?cm2
(6180 SD), T84 cells + TGF-beta = 1,729.7V?cm2 (6292.7; P,
0.001); HAECs control = 759.8V?cm2 (6145.4), HAECs + TGF￾beta = 1,793.5V?cm2 (6349.8; P,0.001)]. These results are
consistent with the TGF-beta-downregulation of ion-transporter
expression and function demonstrated in Figures 1–4.
TGF-beta does not downregulate cAMP or calcium
production in either T84 cells or HAECs
We next tested whether stimulated cAMP or calcium levels were
reduced by TGF-beta treatment, thus potentially contributing to
the greater functional inhibition of CFTR and CaCC (Figure 1A–
D) relative to mRNA and protein levels (Figures 2A–D and 3A–D,
respectively). T84 cells and HAECs were treated with TGF-beta
(10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h and then stimulated with either
ionomycin (2 mM) or forskolin/IBMX (10 mM/100 mM) for 5 min
(Figure S2A–D). TGF-beta treatment did not reduce calcium or
cAMP generation in either cell type, confirming that the inhibitory
effects of TGF-beta on either chloride channel were independent
of calcium and cAMP production.
TGF-beta inhibits F508del CFTR correction by VX-809
Recent studies indicate that VX-809 partially restores F508del
CFTR trafficking in both HAECs and human subjects [27,28].
Treatment of primary F508del/F508del HAECs with VX-809
(3 mM, 48 h) effectively increased F508del CFTR activity and
levels of F508del CFTR B Band and C Band (Figure 5B and D).
In agreement with a previous report [26], these effects were
completely reversed by co-treatment with TGF-beta (10 ng/ml,
48 h) (Figure 5A). Dose-response studies (Figure 5C) demonstrat￾ed that VX-809-corrected F508del CFTR was exquisitely sensitive
to TGF-beta exposure, with complete abrogation of F508del
CFTR activity following 0.1 ng/ml exposure (48 h, P,0.0001).
Downregulation of TMEM16A and CFTR by TGF-beta
precedes expression changes in proteins regulated by
TGF-beta
TGF-beta is known to influence the expression of several
epithelial and mesenchymal proteins [19–21], and in our hands,
corrected F508del CFTR was highly sensitive to TGF-beta
exposure. This raised the question of whether TGF-beta effects
on chloride transporter expression and function could precede it’s
effects on other proteins established to be regulated by TGF-beta.
To address this question, we examined dose/response relation￾ships between TGF-beta exposure and TMEM16A and CFTR
expression relative to an epithelial protein marker (e-cadherin) and
mesenchymal protein markers (vimentin and alpha smooth muscle
actin). All of these markers are well known to be regulated by
TGF-beta [19–21]. As shown in Figure 6A-D, reductions in
CaCC and CFTR expression and function in T84 cells were
observed at TGF-beta doses as low as 0.10 ng/ml (P,0.003),

while changes in e-cadherin and vimentin expression were
undetectable until 1 ng/ml TGF-beta exposure (Figure 6E and
F). Similar findings were observed in HAECs, with statistically
significant reductions in TMEM16A and CFTR expression at
0.1 ng/ml of TGF-beta (Figure 7A–D, P,0.05), while changes in
e-cadherin and vimentin expression were not observed until 1 ng/
ml TGF-beta exposure (Figure 7E and F). Expression of an
additional TGF-beta-regulated protein (alpha smooth muscle
actin) was not detected in either epithelial cell type, with or
without TGF-beta exposure (data not shown). The effect of TGF￾beta on additional airway epithelial markers and morphology by
immunofluorescence is shown in Figure S4A–B. TGF-beta
treatment (10 ng/ml, 48 h) disrupted normal e-cadherin staining,
but had little effect on MUC5AC or acetyl tubulin detection.
Reversal of TGF-beta-inhibited TMEM16A and CFTR
expression by pSmad3 and p38 MAPK blockers
To examine whether common or separate TGF-beta cell￾signaling pathways were responsible for inhibition of TMEM16A
and CFTR expression, we treated cells with selective inhibitors of
Smad3 and p38 MAPK during TGF-beta exposure (10 ng/ml).
TGF-beta exposure upregulated the expression of both pSmad3
and phosphor p38 in both cell types (Figure S3A–D). Smad3
inhibition (SIS3, 5 mM) restored TGF-beta-downregulated
TMEM16A expression in both T84 cells and HAECs (Figure 8A
and C) (P,0.0002), while inhibition of p38 MAPK (SB203580,
10 mM) restored TGF-beta-downregulated CFTR expression in
both cell types (Figure 8B and D) (P,0.035). Control experiments
demonstrated that p38 MAPK inhibition had no effect on
TMEM16A expression, and Smad3 inhibition had no effect on
CFTR expression in either cell type following TGF-beta exposure
(Figure S5A–D).
Figure 1. Downregulation of both CaCC and CFTR currents in T84 cells and HAECs by TGF-beta. T84 (A and B) and HAECs (C and D)
were treated with TGF-beta (10 ng/ml) for 48 h prior to Isc measurement and studied as described in the Methods and as shown in Figure S1. T84
cells without nystatin were studied with symmetric apical and basolateral buffers. All other T84 and HAEC studies were completed with a basolateral￾to-apical chloride secretory gradient [27]. Briefly, to activate CaCC-dependent chloride transport in T84 monolayers (A), cells were stimulated with
ionomycin (Iono; 2 mM) to raise calcium and carbachol (CCh; 100 mM, basolateral) to activate basolateral potassium channels and drive apical chloride
exit. Similar stimuli were used in HAECs (C) but carbachol had little effect on stimulated Isc. To activate CFTR-dependent chloride transport in both
cell types (B and D), cells were stimulated with forskolin/IBMX (10 mM/100 mM) to raise cAMP. In T84 cells (B), carbachol (100 mM, basolateral) was
used to increase apical chloride transport similar to A. In HAECs (D), genistein (50 mM, apical) was used to potentiate CFTR. The right two bars in each
panel represent studies with a chloride secretory gradient following permeabilization of the basolateral membrane with nystatin (50 mg/ml). (A)

Discussion
In the current study, we examined intersections between TGF￾beta exposure and calcium- and cAMP-activated chloride
currents, TMEM16A and CFTR expression, and dose/response
relationships between TGF-beta-regulated proteins in two CF￾affected cell types. We hypothesized that TGF-beta may have
broad and potent effects on chloride transport in both airway and
colonic epithelia. Our findings demonstrate clearly that TGF-beta
is a strong negative regulator of both CaCC and CFTR, which are
the two key epithelial chloride transporters relevant to CF
pathogenesis. The two pathways were regulated by separate
transcription factors (pSmad2/3 and p38 MAPK), and their
sensitivity to TGF-beta was greater than that of common markers
reflective of TGF-beta signaling (e-cadherin and vimentin). The
results confirm reports by Howe and colleagues [25] describing
downregulation of CFTR by TGF-beta in T84 cells. Similar
findings in the porcine vas deferens have been reported by
Pierucci-Alves and colleagues [39], and both of these studies
identified p38 MAPK as a contributor to TGF-beta inhibition of
CFTR. Our data also confirm recent reports in HAECs [26,37],
including downregulation of wtCFTR and F50del CFTR currents
and expression produced by VX-809.
Our results extend prior work in this area in at least two critical
ways, demonstrating that i) TGF-beta inhibitory effects extend to
CaCC and TMEM16A in both colonocytes (T84 cells) and
HAECs, and ii) TGF-beta inhibition of CaCC, TMEM16A and
CFTR occurred at low doses relative to established effects of TGF￾beta on other epithelial proteins. While TGF-beta treatment

upregulated expression of a mesenchymal marker (vimentin) and
downregulated an epithelial marker (e-cadherin), changes of
complete epithelial:mesenchymal transition were not seen over
the time course and dosing used in our experiments. We did not
observe induction of alpha smooth muscle actin expression in
either cell type, and HAECs continued to express MUC5AC and
the cilia marker acetyl tubulin. The effects on CaCC, TMEM16A
and CFTR were observed at 10-fold lower doses of TGF-beta than
necessary to induce changes in other proteins regulated by TGF￾beta (Figures 6 and 7). These results indicate that TMEM16A and
CFTR are highly sensitive to TGF-beta exposure. In addition, our
data support the notion that these chloride channels may be
sensitive to tissue-specific conditions of increased TGF-beta
activity. Although our studies were not designed to clarify the
relative contribution of TMEM16A to CaCC, they do demon￾strate the similar sensitivity of both TMEM16A and CaCC to
TGF-beta downregulation in both T84 cells and HAECs.
Previously, it has been reported that TGF-beta levels in the
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of CF patients were nearly
three-fold higher than that observed in non-CF patients
(135615 pg/ml vs 57610 pg/ml, P,0.01) [40], with levels
further increased in CF patients with diminished lung function
[increased compared to CF patients with normal lung function
(205.9620.5 pg/ml vs 106.4624.0 pg/ml, P,0.01)] [41]. Since

the epithelial lining fluid is estimated to be diluted over 100-fold in
BAL fluid [42,43], local TGF-beta levels in the airways of CF
patients may be as high as 2–20 ng/ml, which emphasizes the
applicability of the current results to the lower-airway conditions
seen in CF patients. Also, we have previously reported that plasma
TGF-beta levels are increased during CF pulmonary exacerba￾tions and in pediatric patients with more-severe lung disease based
on lung function (forced expiratory volume at 1 second or FEV1)
segregation and microbiology (with plasma concentrations ranging
from 1-7 ng/ml) [41]. While determination of tissue-specific levels
of TGF-beta was beyond the scope of this study, the results extend
our previous observations and those of other investigators,
providing evidence of direct, inverse relationships between
chloride-channel activity and TGF-beta exposure in two distinct
CF-affected epithelia.
Although TGF-beta has been identified as a genetic modifier of
the CF phenotype in three separate cohorts [15,16,44,45], the
mechanism of disease modification attributable to TGF-beta
remains elusive. TGF-beta is a complex signaling molecule that
regulates a number of critical cell functions including growth,
senescence, proliferation, and repair [46,47]. Changes in cellular
behavior are governed by activation of TGF-beta receptors, with
subsequent triggering of signaling pathways that change gene
expression. Activation of the transcription factors pSmad-2/3
leads to their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
where they regulate the expression of several epithelial and
mesenchymal genes. Smad-independent pathways are also acti￾vated by TGF-beta receptors, including stimulation of p38
MAPK, Akt, and JNK [48–51]. These cell-signaling pathways
influence the expression of additional target-gene networks that
can result in tissue fibrosis [52]. Our data indicate that TGF-beta
activation of pSmad-2/3 contributes to the downregulation of
TMEM16A (Figure 8A and C), and activation of phosphor p38
MAPK contributes to the downregulation of CFTR (Figure 8B
and D), Complimentary control experiments concluded that the
p38 MAPK inhibitor effects were specific for CFTR (with no
rescue of TMEM16A expression following TGF-beta treatment -
Figure S5B and D). Similar experiments confirmed that the Smad￾2/3 inhibitor did not rescue TGF-beta downregulated expression
of CFTR in either T84 cells or HAECs (Figure S5A and C).
Comparisons of TGF-beta effects on Isc and protein and
transcript levels are summarized in Table 1. CaCC currents and
TMEM16A protein levels were reduced 61–67%, whereas
TMEM16A transcript levels were only reduced 38–46% in both
T84 cells and HAECs. Thus, TMEM16A protein levels and
CaCC currents followed parallel sensitivity to TGF-beta that
exceeded TMEM16A transcriptional effects. For CFTR, tran￾script levels were reduced 45% and 71% in T84 cells and HAECs,
respectively, whereas CFTR conductance was reduced 94–98% in
both cell types. These results therefore support the hypothesis that
TGF-beta effects on chloride-channel function include transcrip￾tional and post-transcriptional inhibition. Although part of the
discrepancy between chloride-channel expression and function
could represent TGF-beta influences on basolateral chloride-entry
pathways, the persistent inhibitory effects produced by TGF-beta
in the presence of basolateral permeabilization suggest that its
effects included apical-membrane transporters (Figure 2A–D).
Inhibitors of Smad3 and p38 partially rescued TMEM16A and
CFTR protein levels (Figure 8A and C), but failed to consistently
rescue CFTR and CaCC function in either cell type (data not
shown), suggesting that the total effects of TGF-beta may indeed
include additional downregulatory effects on chloride-entry
pathways in the basolateral membrane. This broad-based down￾regulation of ion transport activity by TGF-beta appears logical,
since ion transport is a critical function of fully differentiated
epithelia, and TGF-beta treatment can lead to a less-differentiated
cell phenotype [19–21]. The downregulatory effect of TGF-beta
on epithelial ion-transport function is further supported by our
observation of decreased CaCC, CFTR and amiloride-sensitive
currents (a surrogate for ENaC) in HAECs and the disruption of
Figure 4. TGF-beta disruption of airway surface liquid (ASL) regulation in HAECs. Polarized non-CF HAECs had apical fluid removed, and
the apical surface was then bolused with 20 ml of media. Cells were treated with vehicle (control) or TGF-beta (10 ng/ml), and the ASL volume was
measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h post bolus (PB). TGF-beta or vehicle (diluted in water) was added to the to the apical bolus media at time = 0, and to
the basolateral media at time = 0, 24 and 48 hours. N = 6. *P = 0.02 (control vs TGF-beta); **P = 0.00043 (control vs TGF-beta); ***P = 0.07 (control vs

normal ASL-volume regulation (Figure 4). A recent study also
supports our finding as TGF-beta disrupts ion and fluid transport
in the murine lung by downregulating ENaC in vivo [53]. Further
defining these pathways may identify therapeutic targets that
enhance chloride-transporter function in conditions of high TGF￾beta activity, including optimized rescue of F508del CFTR.
Indeed, VX-809 monotherapy has been shown to reduce sweat￾chloride levels in a dose-dependent manner in F508del homozy￾gous CF patients, but these effects were not associated with
detectable improvements in airway F508del CFTR function (by
nasal potential difference measurements), F508del CFTR traffick￾ing (in rectal biopsies), or lung function [28]. These data support
the notion that factors within CF-affected tissue compartments
could contribute to differential modulator efficacy relative to the
sweat gland.
Post-transcriptional regulation of TMEM16A has not been fully
described, and post-transcriptional regulation of CFTR is com￾plex, involving numerous binding partners in the endoplasmic
reticulum [e.g., Hsp70, Hsc70, and Hdj-1 [54,55]], the Golgi
apparatus and post-Golgi compartment [e.g., CAL (CFTR￾associated ligand), TC10, and Snare [56,57]], and endosomes
[58–60]. Furthermore, mature CFTR at the plasma membrane
can be targeted for internalization and rapid degradation [61].
Therefore, although our data do not identify which of these (or
other) steps are responsible for the more-pronounced effects of
TGF-beta on chloride-channel function and protein levels relative
to transcription, our findings do demonstrate that CFTR may be
particularly susceptible to TGF-beta effects in different cell types.
TGF-beta also has been shown to downregulate other ion
channels in CFTR-affected epithelia [25], which is consistent
with the loss of key epithelial functions produced by TGF-beta.
Based on our results, we have established clear and testable
hypotheses regarding how local tissue TGF-beta signaling may
impact the CF phenotype, potentially modifying CF disease (or
other diseases) through effects on CaCC, TMEM16A, and CFTR.
For example, increased TGF-beta conditions in the airway of CF
patients may be predicted to reduce CaCC-dependent chloride
transport, leaving the airway epithelium vulnerable to mucus
stasis, infection, and inflammation. In non-CF conditions, elevated
tissue levels of TGF-beta may be predicted to reduce CFTR and
CaCC activity with potential downstream effects. Although both
of these conditions are currently speculative and need to be
interpreted in the context of effects of TGF-beta on sodium
transport, they provide testable mechanisms to examine how
TGF-beta influences the CF phenotype through modulation of ion
transport.

Figure S1 Examples of CaCC and CFTR activation and
blockade by specific channel inhibitors. T84 cells in
symmetric medium (A and B) were pretreated with indomethacin
(10 mM apical and basolateral) for 30 min followed by amiloride
(‘Amil’, 100 mM apical) for 20 min prior to stimulation. To
activate CaCC-dependent transport (A), cells were stimulated with
ionomycin (‘Iono’ 2 mM apical and basolateral) to increase
calcium followed by carbachol (‘Cch’ 100 mM basolateral). CaCC
was blocked by tannic acid (500 mM apical).To activate CFTR￾dependent transport (B), cells were stimulated with forskolin/
IBMX (‘Fsk’ 10 mM plus IBMX 100 mM apical and basolateral) to
increase cAMP followed by carbachol (‘Cch’ 100 mM basolateral)
to activate basolateral potassium channels and increase the
electrochemical force for chloride transport (producing a large
current spike in the presence of open chloride channels in the
apical membrane). Cells were then treated with CFTRinh172
(‘Inh172’ 10 mM apical) to block CFTR currents. (C and D)
HAECs were studied with a chloride secretory gradient.
Conditions were similar to those used in T84 cells, except that
HAECs were not pretreated with indomethacin, and genistein
(‘Gen’ 50 mM apical) replaced Cch to potentiate CFTR.

Figure S4 Immunofluorescent detection of e-cadherin
(green), MUC5AC (red), or acetyl tubulin (purple) in
primary polarized HAECs. HAECs grown on transwell inserts
were fixed overnight at 4uC with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Whole mount immunofluores￾cence staining was performed on transwell inserts. The samples
were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and
blocked in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum for 3 hours
at room temperature. The samples were then incubated with
primary antibodies [e-Cadherin 1:100 (Cell Signaling, MA),
Acetylated Tubulin 1:3000 (Sigma, MO) and Muc5AC 1;100
(Abcam, MA)] for 24 hours at 4uC. The samples were then
washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation for 2 hours
with the respective fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies.
The samples were washed four times with PBS and counter￾stained with DAPI (1 mg/ml). Inserts were mounted on a slide with
a No. 1.5 coverslip. Immunofluorescence images were acquired
using a Nikon A1Rsi inverted confocal microscope with a 60X WI
NA 1.27 objective using a 1.5AU pinhole resulting in a 0.84 mm
optical section. Multi-labeled Z-stack images with a 0.28 mm
interval between optical sections were acquired sequentially using
channel series. Z-intensity correction was used to compensate for
reduced signal intensity at increasing Z-depth. Z-stacks were
projected in slice view using the Nikon NIS-Elements software.
The 3D volume was created in Imaris (Bitplane) using the surpass
view and "snapshot" to capture projections. E-cadherin staining
was disrupted by TGF-beta treatment (A; B - Z stack) while
MUC5AC and acetyl tubulin detection were unaffected.
