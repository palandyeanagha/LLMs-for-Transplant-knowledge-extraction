A 19-years-old girl was referred for lung transplant due to end stage lung disease secondary to idiopathic bilateral 
bronchiectasis. Her routine pre lung transplant evaluation showed normal esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) and 
24-hours impedance pH monitoring. Four weeks after the bilateral sequential lung transplantation (LTx), she developed dyspha￾gia, chest pain and regurgitation, complicated by aspiration pneumonia. Repeated HRM showed Jackhammer esophagus, de￾layed gastric emptying and abnormal 24-hour pH impedance monitoring consistent with the diagnosis of gastroesophageal re￾flux disease. Twelve weeks after LTx, she was symptom free, HRM and 24-hour impedance pH monitoring returned to normal. 
To the best of our knowledge, this rare transient esophageal hypercontractility episode occurred after LTx and recovered with￾out any specific treatment was never reported in literature. The etiopathogenesis of Jackhammer esophagus in general and LTx 
induced dysmotility in particular is discussed and reviewed.

Introduction
Jackhammer esophagus (spastic nutcracker) is a newly de￾scribed entity identified on high-resolution manometry (HRM) 
and defined as a distal contractile integral (DCI) of greater than 
8,000 mmHg · cm · sec on single or multiple swallows in the 
presence of normal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation; 
this DCI value was not encountered in control subjects.1
 As hy￾pertensive peristalsis presents a substantial heterogeneity, it is 
subsequently divided into “nutcracker esophagus” with the mean 
DCI is within the 5,000-8,000 mmHg · cm · sec range and into

 Because the repetitive, high-amplitude contractions evoke 
the action of a Jackhammer, Roman and Tutuian et al2
 coined the 
descriptive term “Jackhammer esophagus” (rather than spastic 
nutcracker) to fit better with the contractile morphology and to 
avoid confusion with spasm that occurs in a context of reduced 
distal latency. This phenomenon, branded “Jackhammer esoph￾agus” was never encountered in control subjects and usually ac￾companied by dysphagia or chest pain, occuring either in associa￾tion with esophageal pathology or as an isolated motility distur￾bance.3
 A primary or secondary neuromuscular disorder was sus￾pected in the past. In fact, its physiopathology remains unclear 
and different hypotheses have been suggested. The clinical pre￾sentation is diverse; some Jackhammer esophagus cases are clear￾ly associated with mechanical esophagogastric junction outflow 
obstruction, others secondary to reflux disease, and some are at￾tributable to primary esophageal muscle hypercontractility. Some 
reports have focused on the high prevalence of esophageal dys￾motility and delayed gastric emptying after lung transplantation 
(LTx) with inadvertent partial or total surgical vagotomy as the 
suspected mechanism of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD).4
 However, these disorders might be secondary 
to a reactive process like GERD. We report a case of severe 
esophageal spastic hypercontractility (Jackhammer esophagus), 
the symptoms of which developed 4 weeks after the transplant, a 
repeat manometry 8 weeks after bilateral sequential LTx con￾firmed the diagnosis. This hypercontractility resolved 4 week 
later. The etiopathogenesis of this transient esophageal dysmo￾tility in relation to postsurgical trauma and other pathophysio￾logical changes developing after the surgical trauma of LTx will 
be discussed and reviewed. 
Case Report
Nineteen-year-old female was diagnosed as idiopathic bi￾lateral bronchiectasis and developed end stage lung disease and 
respiratory failure. She was referred to King Faisal Specialist 
Hospital & Research Center in June 2012 for further assessment 
and possible LTx. During her routine pre-transplant work up, 
esophageal HRM 24-hour pH impedance monitoring and 
modified barium swallow were performed to rule out any major 
esophageal dysmotility or significant GERD, which could pre￾dispose her to recurrent aspiration pneumonia and pseudomonas 
colonization. There was no significant past history of heartburn, 
regurgitation, chest pain or dysphagia before the LTx. HRM 
study was performed with a 4.2 mm outer diameter solid state as￾sembly with 36 circumferential sensors spaced at 1-cm intervals 
(Given Imaging, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Esophageal pressure 
topography data was analyzed using ManoViewTM analysis 
software. Her pre-transplant, HRM parameters were within 
normal limits (Table 1). Ambulatory impedance pH monitoring 
study was performed before the LTx, after an overnight fast (off 
proton pump inhibitors [PPI] for 1 week) on an out-patient ba￾sis, using a ZepHr system (Sandhill Scientific, Inc., Highland 
Ranch, CO, USA), which was equipped with a catheter with 6 
impedance electrodes and 2 pH electrodes (first at distal esoph￾agus and second at just below the upper esophageal sphincter). 
Both the impedance and pH signals were recorded at 50 Hz on a 
128 MB compact flash (SanDisk, Milpitas, CA, USA). No sig￾nificant gastro-esophageal reflux was reported in pre-transplant 
24-hour impedance pH evaluation (Table 2).
She underwent bilateral sequential LTx in October-2012 
with no major post-operative complication and discharged after 2

weeks in stable condition on immunosuppressant drugs (myco￾phenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and prednisolone). She was re-ad￾mitted 4 weeks later, when she developed aspiration pneumonia 
with additional complaints of dysphagia, regurgitation and 
heartburn. Her second hospital course was again uneventful; she 
received parenteral antibiotics, PPI and discharged in satisfactory 
condition. It was suspected that her aspiration pneumonia might 
have been triggered by GERD secondary to esophageal dysmo￾tility. She was advised to continue her immunosuppressant and 
standard chemoprophylaxis with valganciclovir, bactrim and itra￾conazole, in addition to esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily to sup￾press the symptoms of GERD. Azithromycin 3 times weekly was 
added as anti-inflammatory agent. The patient’s HRM study 
was repeated 8 weeks after LTx, and her detail HRM datasets 
were reviewed according to the current Chicago classification. It 
showed typical spastic hypercontractile contractions (the greatest 
DCI = 12,437 mmHg · cm · sec) consistent with the diagnosis 
of Jackhammer esophagus. Surprisingly, her last esophageal 
HRM returned to normal at 12 weeks after LTx, as shown in the 
study of esophageal pressure topography with conventional line 
tracings (Figure) without use of any muscle relaxant or sedatives. 
The data included in the HRM study was LES resting pressure, 
distal latency, integrated residual pressure, DCI and distal esoph￾ageal amplitude at 3, 7 and 11 cm above LES and contractile 
front velocity before LTx, 4 and 12 weeks after LTx as shown in 
Table 1.
The 24-hour pH impedance monitoring study was repeated 
again on PPI after 8 weeks of LTx (because she was symptomatic 
on PPI) which was consistent with significant GERD. Gastric 
emptying study also after the LTx showed severely delayed gas￾tric emptying for solid meal (97% retention at 120 minutes with 
stagnation of food at 4 hours delayed images) consistent with gas￾troparesis. Post LTx barium swallow and upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy was normal. The impedance pH study (on PPI) was 
repeated 12 weeks after LTx and surprisingly, no significant ab￾normality was seen (Table 2). 
Discussion
To date, there is no available data regarding the impact of bi-

lateral sequential LTx on esophageal hypercontractility. Jack￾hammer esophagus is recently described term used for hyper￾contractile esophagus with at least a single contraction with DCI 
of > 8,000 mmHg · cm · sec. In fact, the pathophysiology of 
Jackhammer esophagus remains unclear but different hypotheses 
have been suggested. Hypertensive contractions have been no￾ticed in the presence of mechanical obstruction induced by fun￾doplication or laparoscopic gastric band.5
 Vigorous esophageal 
contractions may be related to excessive excitation or myocyte hy￾pertrophy, their hypothesis is that an increase in esophageal mus￾cle thickness/muscle cross-sectional area is a marker of outflow 
obstruction of the esophagus.6
 These two suggested mechanisms 
are not pertinent in our case, as there was no previous history of 
distal esophageal ulceration or stricture secondary to GERD or 
esophageal injury during LTx leading to postsurgical scarring, 
adhesion and mechanical obstruction. Anderson et al7
 document￾ed a statistically significant increase in esophageal contraction 
amplitudes in both healthy volunteers and in patients with 
non-cardiac chest pain while being exposed to acute stress.7
 In 
our case, it may be possible that after LTx, she developed pneu￾monia that required hospitalization; where stress might play a 
role in the pathogenesis of transient hypercontractility that recov￾ered after discharge. 
Our patient developed post LTx aspiration pneumonia prob￾ably secondary to GERD, as documented and supported by pos￾itive 24-pH impedance monitoring. GERD is associated with 
chest pain and hypertensive esophageal contractions.8
 The preva￾lence of GERD is observed to be higher after LTx. Young et al9
reported the incidence of GERD in 65% patients after LTx, 
however, others10 stated around 70%. There are multiple reasons 
to have higher prevalence of GERD after LTx. Davis et al11 con￾cluded that GERD is highly prevalent after LTx and reported 
that 36% of GERD patients had ineffective esophageal motility 
as compared with 6% of patients without GERD. It is not clear 
whether GERD triggered the hypercontractility or vice versa but 
in our case GERD and esophageal hypercontractility, both re￾sponded to PPI.
High prevalence of esophageal dysmotility observed prior to 
LTx might continue after the LTx. Basseri et al12 reported both 
hypotensive and aperistaltic swallows were 6-fold more prevalent 
in LTx candidates than in control subjects, while their control 
subjects had normal HRM, LTx candidates had 76.7% of 
esophageal peristaltic dysfunction. Pre-transplant evaluation in 
the present case included normal HRM and 24-hour impedance 
pH monitoring, so preexisting dysmotility is unlikely the cause of 
post LTx hypercontractility. The previous literature mainly de￾scribed esophageal hypomotility disorders developed after LTx, 
but not hypercontractility (Jackhammer esophagus).
The present case developed gastroparesis after the LTx. 
Studies have shown that gastroparesis is common in LTx recipi￾ents; complicated by GERD with recurrent aspiration and asso￾ciated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. 
Raviv et al13 documented delayed gastric emptying in 50% of pa￾tients before LTx, 74% after 3 months of LTx and 63% at 12 
months. In addition, they also demonstrated that 50% of patients 
with delayed gastric emptying demonstrated an abnormally low 
esophageal tone and about 27% with delayed gastric emptying 
had an abnormal DeMeester score. In another report,14 delayed 
gastric emptying occurred in 67% of their LTx candidates with 
cystic fibrosis, with the prevalence increasing to 97% about 6 
weeks after LTx. Dougenis et al15 conducted a prospective study, 
where they performed esophageal manometry before and after 
pneumonectomy and concluded that motility disorders were most 
evident following major lung resection like pneumonectomy. 
After LTx, disturbance of the autonomic nervous systems is one 
of the major reasons to lead to esophageal dysmotility and delayed 
gastric emptying. Our patient reported to have significant gastro￾paresis, which diverted our attention towards vagal nerve injury. 
Anatomic considerations suggest that the vagi are most likely to 
be injured at or near the lung hila. At the lung root, each nerve 
gives branches to the pulmonary plexuses and then divides into 2 
or more branches that pass infero-medially to unite with the cor￾responding branches of the opposite vagus to form a plexus sur￾rounding and supplying the esophagus.16 Sifrim et al17 have sug￾gested that the mechanism of the increase in contraction ampli￾tude might be due to an imbalance between excitatory and in￾hibitory innervation, and that patients with spastic disorders of 
the esophagus have an impaired inhibitory innervation whether 
this abnormality is secondary to the vagal nerves denervation, lo￾cal ischemia, scarring of the esophagus and mediastinum after 
surgery. Lung transplantation involves vagal nerve transection 
resulting in sensory and autonomic denervation of the airways 
and gastroesophageal dysfunction; whether this transient esoph￾ageal dysmotility in our case was the effect of limited intra-oper￾ative damage to vagus nerve branches or its plexus, patient re￾gained her function after recovery. We overlooked to perform the 
gastric emptying study before the LTx, therefore whether gastro￾paresis developed due to intraoperative vagus nerve injury or it 
was present before the LTx is debatable.
Regarding medications as a cause of Jackhammer esophagus, 

Mohammed Q Khan, et al
394 Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility 
Mertens et al18 reported that LTx patients “on” azithromycin had 
less gastroesophageal reflux and bile acids aspiration. They found 
a reduction in the total number of reflux events (acid and 
non-acid) induced by azithromycin and hypothesized that the an￾ti-reflux effect was due to its prokinetic properties that enhanced 
esophageal motility and accelerated gastric emptying. Our patient 
received azithromycin as a prophylactic dose (250 mg 3 times a 
week) after LTx, which is unlikely to augment esophageal hyper￾contractility. There are no reports in literature where mycopheno￾late mofetil, tacrolimus or valganciclovir claimed to have any ma￾jor side effect on esophageal motility. Immune-suppressant drugs 
induced dysmotility is unlikely as the patient continued the treat￾ment but in contrast, hypercontractility returned to normal. In 
immunocompromised patients, reactivations of esophageal viral 
and fungal infections have been reported in the past. Recently, 
varicella zoster vagal neuropathy induced by this neurotropic vi￾rus was reported by Paliwal et al19 which caused esophageal hypo￾motility and gastroperesis. All our post LTx patients’ including 
this patient were maintained on prophylaxis with valganciclovir 
and was monitored for reactivation of cytomegalovirus by serial 
cytomegalovirus antigenemia tests. In addition, no esophageal 
mucosal abnormality was seen during endoscopy and her varicella 
zoster, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus IgM antibody and 
early Epstein-Barr virus antigenemia tests remained negative. 
In summary, the pre-transplant evaluation of this case did not 
show any esophageal motility abnormality, the transient “Jac￾khammer esophagus” developed after the bilateral sequential 
LTx and recovered without any specific treatment except PPI for 
symptomatic GERD. The pathophysiology of this rare esoph￾ageal spastic nutcracker remained obscure, but the possible etio￾pathogenesis include hypercontractility precipitated by GERD, 
started by neurotropic viral infection, initiated by stress induced 
surgical trauma, induced by outflow obstruction in and around 
LES, exaggerated by prokinetic and immunosuppressive drugs 
or complicated by partial vagotomy during LTx that lead to 
esophageal dysmotility and gastroparesis. In our case, the most 
likely triggering factor to develop Jackhammer esophagus was 
GERD, which was precipitated by LTx related vagal nerve in￾jury and relieved by PPI.
