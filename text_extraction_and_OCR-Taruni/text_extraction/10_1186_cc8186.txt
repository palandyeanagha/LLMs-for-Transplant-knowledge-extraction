Abstract
Introduction Prothrombin complex concentrates are
recommended for rapid reversal of vitamin K anticoagulants. As
they normalize levels of vitamin K dependent clotting factors and
re-establish hemostasis, they may also be used as adjunctive
therapy in patients with major bleeding. The aim of this study
was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of prothrombin
complex concentrates in the surgical setting.
Methods The case notes of 50 patients requiring urgent oral
anticoagulation reversal (n = 12) or with severe perioperative
coagulopathic bleeding (n = 38) who received an infusion of
prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex P/N(R) 500) at the
surgical department of the University of Munich Hospital,
Germany were retrospectively reviewed. Efficacy of prothrombin
complex concentrate application was evaluated using the Quick
test, reported as an international normalized ratio, hemodynamic
measurements and requirement for blood products. Safety
assessments included whole blood hemoglobin levels and
specific parameters of organ dysfunction.
Results Baseline characteristics were comparable, except that
mean baseline international normalized ratio and hemoglobin
levels were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in anticoagulation
reversal than in bleeding patients. In anticoagulation reversal,
the international normalized ratio was significantly reduced (from
2.8 +/- 0.2 at baseline to 1.5 +/- 0.1, P < 0.001) after one
prothrombin complex concentrate infusion (median dose 1500
IU; lower quartile 1,000, upper quartile 2,000). No major
bleeding was observed during surgery after prothrombin
complex concentrate administration. Only one patient received
platelets and red blood cell transfusion after prothrombin
complex concentrate administration. In bleeding patients,
infusion of prothrombin complex concentrate (median dose
2,000 IU; lower quartile 2,000, upper quartile 3,000)
significantly reduced the INR from 1.7 +/- 0.1 at baseline to 1.4
+/- 0.1 (P < 0.001). This decrease was unrelated to fresh frozen
plasma or vitamin K administration. Bleeding stopped after
prothrombin complex concentrate administration in 4/11 (36%)
patients with surgical bleeding and 26/27 (96%) patients with
diffuse bleeding. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly from
baseline in bleeding patients (P < 0.05) and mean arterial
pressure stabilized (P < 0.05). No thrombotic events or changes
in organ function were reported in any patient.
Conclusions Prothrombin complex concentrate application
effectively reduced international normalized ratios in
anticoagulation reversal, allowing surgical procedures and
interventions without major bleeding. In bleeding patients, the
improvement in coagulation after prothrombin complex
concentrate administration was judged to be clinically
significant.
Introduction
An increasing number of people in economically developed
nations are receiving oral anticoagulants for the treatment and
prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases [1,2]. Among the
most commonly used oral anticoagulants are the synthetic
coumarin derivatives warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenpro￾coumon. All three drugs act by inhibiting the biosynthesis of
the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX and
X), which produces a functional deficit of these procoagulant
proteins [2]. The main indications for vitamin K antagonists
are: primary and secondary prevention of venous thromboem￾bolism; prevention of systemic embolism (for example, stroke)
CRP: C-reactive protein; FFP: fresh frozen plasma; INR: international normalized ratio; IU: international units; PCC: prothrombin complex concentrate; 
RBC: red blood cells; SEM: standard error of the mean.

in patients with mechanical heart valves or atrial fibrillation; and
prophylaxis (as adjunctive therapy) for systemic embolism fol￾lowing myocardial infarction [3].
While the antithrombotic benefits of oral anticoagulants are
well established, these therapies increase the risk of hemor￾rhagic events, some of which may be severe or even life-threat￾ening [4-7]. The risk of bleeding in patients receiving
anticoagulants increases with surgery, trauma, over-anticoag￾ulation or raised international normalized ratios (INRs) -
although complications can still occur when the INR is within
the therapeutic range [1,2,4,5,8-10].
Because of the association between vitamin K antagonists
and an increased risk of hemorrhagic events, patients under￾going emergency procedures and those with life-threatening/
major bleeding or highly elevated INRs require urgent and
immediate reversal of anticoagulant activity [1,5,11]. Recom￾mended treatments for rapid reversal of oral anticoagulant
therapy include fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin
complex concentrates (PCCs); in all cases these should be
supplemented with oral or intravenous vitamin K [1,3,5,11-17].
PCCs, which contain three or four vitamin K-dependent clot￾ting factors, offer a number of advantages over FFP. These
include a lower volume of infusion, ambient storage and recon￾stitution, lack of blood group specificity, a more favorable
safety profile and improved efficacy [1,9]. Because of these
properties, several clinical practice guidelines now recom￾mend PCCs, in preference or as an alternative to FFP, for rapid
anticoagulant reversal [1,3,5,11-17]. The PCC used in this
study (Beriplex P/N®, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) con￾tains factors II, VII, IX and X in addition to the vitamin K￾dependent coagulation inhibitors protein C and protein S [18].
Beriplex P/N® is prepared using pasteurization and nanofiltra￾tion to facilitate viral inactivation and elimination [19].
As PCCs are able to normalize levels of vitamin K-dependent
clotting factors, and re-establish hemostasis, they may also be
used as adjunctive therapy in patients with massive bleeding.
Indeed, in some European countries, including Germany,
PCCs are prescribed routinely for the management of massive
peri- or post-operative bleeding, even though clinical data in
this setting are lacking [20,21].
The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the
use of PCCs for perioperative treatment in a surgical patient
cohort. We examined the impact of PCC therapy on coagula￾tion and circulatory parameters and additional blood product
use, and measured whole blood hemoglobin levels and spe￾cific parameters of organ dysfunction to assess the safety pro￾file.
Materials and methods
The study was a retrospective analysis of case notes describ￾ing the medical history and clinical management of 50 adults
admitted to the surgical department at the University of
Munich Hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2004,
who received an infusion of PCC. The analysis was approved
by the hospital's ethical review board. No exclusion criteria
were applied; all patients receiving PCC entered consecu￾tively into the study.
Patients were subdivided into those considered by the treating
clinical team to require urgent and immediate reversal of vita￾min K antagonist therapy and those treated for severe bleed￾ing. The clinical requirement for PCC therapy in the bleeding
group was assessed on the basis of life-threatening bleeding
as diagnosed by the physician on duty and indicated by INR
>1.1. Hemoglobin levels of ≤7 g/dl triggered red blood cell
(RBC) transfusions in patients without cardiac risk. In patients
with cardiac risk, a transfusion trigger of ≤9 g/dl was applied.
Life-threatening bleeding was defined as the loss of more than
150 ml per minute or replacement of total blood volume within
three hours.
The PCC used in this study was Beriplex P/N® 500 U, which
contains 400 to 960 international units (IU) factor II, 200 to
500 IU factor VII, 400 to 620 IU factor IX and 440 to 1,200 IU
factor X. In all cases, the PCC was administered by the physi￾cian on duty. The dose of PCC therapy was determined
according to baseline INR, the extent and location of any
bleeding and the clinical scenario. For anticoagulation
reversal, patients were treated with PCC according to a stand￾ard protocol, which is in line with recent guidelines [16,22];
the aim was to attain an INR of 1.7 prior to surgery. The PCC
dose was calculated from the Quick value using the formula:
target Quick value (%) - actual Quick value (%) × body weight
(kg) = dose in IU. The INR targeted for anticoagulation reversal
patients is higher than that targeted for bleeding patients (INR
of 1.2) due to the need to balance an acceptable risk of bleed￾ing with sufficient prevention of thromboembolism. The PCC
was administered intravenously (via central or peripheral
venous lines) over a 10- to 20-minute period. PCC administra￾tion was started 30 minutes prior to surgery or planned inter￾vention in reversal patients. We have used the same
procedure for many years and have found a very good relation￾ship between the dose administered and the change in Quick
value (INR). Therefore, INR was not routinely determined
before starting surgery. This analysis focuses on the perioper￾ative use of PCC (up to the first post-operative day) and does
not consider the effect of PCCs given thereafter. In patients
with severe bleeding, repeat doses were given if necessary. All
RBC and additional procoagulant hemostatic therapies (plate￾lets, fibrinogen concentrate, FFP, desmopressin or vitamin K)
administered during the six hours before and six hours after
PCC administration were recorded.
Blood (6 ml citrated, 10 ml serum and 4 ml Ethylendiamin￾tetraacetat (EDTA)) was routinely drawn for determination of
coagulation hemoglobin and safety parameters before appli-

cation of PCC. Coagulation was evaluated using the INR and
Quick value (Thromborel S, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal
sample, raised to the power of the International Sensitivity
Index value for the thromboplastin used. Quick value is a func￾tion of the reciprocal value of a patient's prothrombin time ver￾sus that of standard human plasma, expressed as a
percentage. INR was assessed less than three hours before
PCC administration (pre-treatment value) and up to three
hours post-dose, when the patient had returned to the surgical
ward.
Safety assessments included evaluation of hemoglobin levels
and serum concentrations of bilirubin (BELT 2, Roche GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany), creatinine (CREY 2, Roche GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany) and C-reactive protein (CRP, CRPLX,
Roche GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) C-reactive protein (CRP)
and CRPLX before and three days after PCC administration.
In addition, vital signs (that is, body temperature, blood pres￾sure and heart rate) were also evaluated before and within six
hours after PCC administration.
Patient data were obtained from a review of patient charts,
medical records and other relevant documentation. Due to the
observational nature of this analysis, there was no pre-speci￾fied primary endpoint. Study endpoints included change from
baseline (pre- vs post-PCC treatment) in INR, and concentra￾tions of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin and
CRP. Arterial pressures were measured via an arterial line
using a non-invasive technique within six hours pre- and post￾PCC application. Hemostatic endpoints included cessation of
acute bleeding, prevention of bleeding during interventional
procedures and utilization of alternative blood component
replacement therapies within six hours pre- and post-PCC
application. Unless otherwise specified, all data are expressed
as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical eval￾uation was performed with non-parametric testing (Wilcoxon)
for inter-group and intra-group comparisons taking into con￾sideration the small number of patients and the heterogeneity
in clinical treatment. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Results
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown
in Table 1.
Patients requiring urgent reversal of oral 
anticoagulation
Of the 12 patients who required urgent reversal of oral antico￾agulation, the majority were receiving prophylactic vitamin K
antagonist therapy (intravenously) following atrial fibrillation (n
= 4) or mechanical heart valve replacement (n = 3). Two
patients were also receiving concomitant low-molecular
weight heparin as bridging therapy before a planned interven￾tion.
The indications for PCC treatment in this group of patients
included: emergency surgery (vascular [n = 2], trauma [n = 2]
and abdominal [n = 1] surgery); post-trauma (intracranial [n =
1] and intramuscular [n = 1] hemorrhage); cholecystitis [n =
1]; bleeding due to rectal cancer [n = 1]; endoscopic interven￾tion [n = 1]; and coagulation failure (during emergency [n = 1]
and trauma [n = 1] surgery) (Table 2). Two of the patients - one
with cholangitis and one with intracranial bleeding - did not
undergo an invasive procedure.
The median dose of PCC administered was 1,500 IU (lower
quartile 1,000, upper quartile 2,000 IU; Figure 1a). The mean
INR decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from 2.8 ± 0.2 at
baseline to 1.5 ± 0.1 at 180 ± 31 minutes (the mean time of
the first INR measurement after PCC administration; Figure
2a). There was a corresponding significant increase in Quick
values (%) from 33.0 ± 2.9 at baseline to 65.4 ± 6.5; P <
0.001 (Figure 2a). The most common additional conservative
therapy, either before or after PCC, was intravenous vitamin K
(administered before PCC on four occasions and after on
three occasions; Table 3). The mean dose of vitamin K admin￾istered was 21 ± 4 mg (i.v.). Vitamin K was not routinely admin￾istered by the physician on duty when the operative procedure
was to be performed within four hours. Two patients received
platelets, RBCs and FFP, either before or after PCC.
No major perioperative bleeding was reported in anticoagula￾tion reversal patients following PCC infusion. Moreover, pro￾phylactic PCC application allowed operative and
interventional procedures to be performed without the need
for blood component replacement therapy in all but two of the
patients.
Three days after PCC administration, serum creatinine and
bilirubin concentrations were not significantly increased, but
CRP was significantly higher than baseline (P < 0.05), as
expected after an intervention or operation. Hemoglobin con￾centrations were comparable before and after PCC treatment.
Patients treated for severe bleeding
None of the 38 patients treated for severe bleeding were
receiving coumarin derivatives at the time of treatment; before
the bleeding episode, two were receiving aspirin and 25 were
receiving low molecular weight heparin as low-dose thrombo￾prophylaxis. Thirty patients (79%) were undergoing general
surgery, six (16%) vascular surgery, and two (5%) required
surgery as a result of trauma (Table 2). The different locations
of bleeding are summarized in Table 4.
The median dose of PCC administered was 2,000 IU (lower
quartile 2,000, upper quartile 3,000 IU; Figure 1b). In one
patient with an abdominal gun-shot wound associated with
massive retroperitoneal bleeding, a bolus of 6,000 IU of PCC
was applied followed by a continuous infusion with 1,000 IU/
hour to a total dose of 12,000 IU as post-operative bleeding

did not stop despite extensive surgical procedures including
nephrectomy, liver resection and abdominal packing. In bleed￾ing patients, administration of PCC resulted in a significant
reduction (P < 0.001) in the mean INR (from 1.7 ± 0.1 at base￾line to 1.4 ± 0.1; Figure 2b), 147 ± 15 minutes after treatment
(the mean time of the first INR measurement). Mean Quick val￾ues (%) also increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 53.4 ±
2.3 at baseline to 72.1 ± 2.7 (Figure 2b). Bleeding stopped
after administration of PCC in 4 of 11 (36%) patients with sur￾gical bleeding (i.e. bleeding associated with vascular damage
that can rarely be controlled without revision surgery). In
patients with diffuse bleeding (that is, pure, oozing tissue
bleeding with no evidence of damaged blood vessels), the
active bleeding stopped after PCC therapy in 26 of 27 (96%)
affected patients.
Additional conservative therapies administered to 27 patients
within six hours before and 22 patients within six hours after
PCC in the bleeding group were (in descending order of fre￾quency): RBC, FFP, platelets, desmopressin, intravenous vita￾min K and fibrinogen concentrate (Table 3). Twenty of the 22
patients given additional conservative therapies within six
hours after PCC administration received allogeneic blood
components: RBC only (n = 8); RBC and FFP (n = 5); FFP
only (n = 4); RBC, FFP and platelets (n = 2); RBC and plate￾lets (n = 1).
The significant reduction in INR observed in the bleeding
patients was unrelated to whether or not patients received
FFP or vitamin K between sampling for measurement of the
baseline INR and the INR attained (Figure 3a). Among those
patients receiving FFP, there was also no significant difference
in reduction of INR between patients receiving less than six
units and those receiving six units or more (Figure 3b). Addi￾tional conservative therapies did not modify the effect of PCC
on INR or Quick values in this patient group (Figure 4a and
4b). Also, when comparing the mean percentage change in
INR from baseline values, no difference was detected between
patients receiving FFP (with FFP: 23.0 ± 4.0%; without FFP:
13.5 ± 2.1%; P = 0.39) or vitamin K (with vitamin K: 24.7 ±
7.0%; without vitamin K: 13.7 ± 1.8%; P = 0.35).
Hemoglobin levels increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 8.2
± 0.3 g/dl at baseline to 10.6 ± 0.2 g/dl after PCC treatment
(Figure 5) although a comparable amount of RBC was applied
within six hours before and after PCC treatment (Table 3). This
finding also indicates cessation of bleeding. The mean number
of RBC units administered to bleeding patients was 6.9 ± 2.1,
compared with one unit in one anticoagulation reversal patient
(Figure 5). After administration of PCC in bleeding patients
arterial pressure increased (Figure 6), whereas heart rate was
unchanged (Figure 7), indicating hemodynamic stabilization.
Serum creatinine and bilirubin concentrations measured three
days after administration of PCC were not significantly
increased. An increase in CRP was observed, but this was not
statistically significant.
Comparison of anticoagulation reversal and bleeding 
patients
The patient groups were comparable with regard to age and
body temperature. No patient was hypothermic immediately
before PCC administration (Table 1) or after treatment, when
the mean (± SEM) temperature was 37.0°C (± 0.2) in both
groups. The mean INR prior to PCC infusion was significantly
lower in the bleeding group than in the anticoagulation reversal
group (P < 0.001) (Table 1). In terms of safety assessments,
baseline hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in bleeding
patients than in anticoagulation reversal patients (P < 0.001),
which underlies the higher rate of RBC transfusion in the
bleeding patients. Baseline serum bilirubin and creatinine con￾centrations were also lower, although not significantly so, in
the bleeding group compared with the anticoagulation
reversal group. Baseline CRP concentrations were similar in
the two groups. The mean dose of PCC administered was sig￾nificantly higher in bleeding patients than in patients requiring
anticoagulation reversal (P < 0.05) (Figure 1) and overall,
bleeding patients received more hemostatic therapies and all￾ogeneic blood components than anticoagulation reversal
patients.
No thrombotic events or viral transmissions were reported for
any of the patients during the period of hospitalization. How￾ever, there was no standard protocol in place to track potential
virus transmission.

Discussion
PCCs are recommended in various guidelines for the emer￾gency reversal of oral anticoagulation therapy, particularly in
the presence of major bleeding and/or elevated INR [1,3,5,11-
17]. Despite these recommendations, the use of PCC remains
low in many surgical units where emergency physicians con￾tinue to use human plasma because of its widespread availa￾bility, its low cost, its reasonable efficacy and lack of
awareness of the guidelines [1,9,23]. In contrast, PCC has
been used for several years in our surgical unit, since before
the introduction of recent guidelines recommending its use,
both for anticoagulation reversal and for adjunctive treatment
of acute hemorrhage, due to its high clinical efficacy.
PCCs may offer advantages over FFP for urgent reversal of
oral anticoagulation therapy [24]. Comparative studies have
suggested that PCCs may provide more effective and rapid
correction of INR than FFP, with a greater increase in clotting
factors [25-28]. PCCs can also be infused faster than human
plasma, have a reduced volume of administration (and there￾fore, unlike FFP, are not associated with volume overload), are
associated with a shorter preparation time (since some PCCs
can be stored and reconstituted at room temperature,
whereas FFP needs to be thawed prior to use), and do not
require blood-group matching [1].
In this study, PCC effectively normalized the INR in patients
requiring emergency reversal of anticoagulation therapy.
Moreover, the effect on the INR was similar to that reported in

other studies in which PCCs (including Beriplex P/N®) had
been administered with vitamin K to reverse over-anticoagula￾tion, treat anticoagulant-related bleeding, prepare anticoagu￾lant-treated patients for emergency surgery, or manage other
miscellaneous conditions in patients receiving oral anticoagu￾lants [8,25-27,29-36]. In particular, the relatively low dose of
PCC (about 22 IU/kg) used here in the anticoagulant reversal
group (baseline INR 2.8) is comparable with that used by Pab￾inger et al. during a recent prospective trial [30], in which 93%
of emergency coagulant reversal patients with baseline INR 2
to 3.9 achieved INR ≤1.3 after receiving 25 IU/kg of the same
PCC. The mean INR of 1.5 achieved with PCC administration
in anticoagulation reversal patients was below the target
threshold of 1.7. PCC infusion also facilitated surgical proce￾dures in this group, as evidenced by the absence of major peri￾operative bleeding and low use of concomitant blood
component replacement therapy. Our data add further to the
evidence for using PCC in vitamin K antagonist reversal at a
time when guidelines continue to discuss this issue and PCC
is still not available in many European centers.
PCC also restored the INR to nearly normal values (mean of
1.4 compared with a target of 1.2) in patients with acute
severe bleeding. Furthermore, the bleeding episodes ceased
within three hours of PCC administration in 30 out of 38
(79%) patients (4/11 patients with surgical bleeding and 26/
27 patients with diffuse bleeding). This is a particularly impor￾tant observation, as clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of
PCC in patients with severe bleeding not associated with oral
anticoagulation therapy are scarce, despite reports dating
back more than a decade of their potential and their routine
use in massive hemorrhage in many European countries
[20,21,37]. In a recent observational study conducted within a
UK tertiary hospital, significant improvements in clotting times
were reported with PCC in all but two of 20 patients with life￾threatening bleeding [38]. Only five of these patients were
receiving oral anticoagulants; the remaining patients had
severe perioperative or post-operative bleeds. Further expan￾Table 3

sion of this retrospective review demonstrated a considerable
reduction in administration of other blood products during the
24 hours following PCC administration with partial or com￾plete hemostasis achieved in 14 of 18 cases (78%) [39].
Moreover, 83% of these patients received PCC at a lower
dose (≤1,500 IU) than we used in the present study, so it is
also an economically viable option.
The retrospective nature of the present study results in limita￾tions, most notably the lack of a control group. Patients
received conservative therapies in addition to PCC, and the
contribution of these to the reversal of anticoagulation or ces￾sation of bleeding cannot be ruled out. Also no blood sample
of prothrombin was drawn immediately after PCC administra￾tion, reflecting that these data were collected in a real-life clin￾ical situation, rather than being part of a prospective clinical
trial. However, controlled studies are difficult to conduct in this
setting - in particular in the situation where patients are suffer￾ing considerable blood loss, it would be unethical to include a
control group receiving no hemostatic therapy. Additional
units of FFP administered to bleeding patients were unlikely to
be responsible for the increase in Quick results observed. INR
values measured at baseline or after PCC administration were
not significantly different between patients who did or did not
receive FFP between the baseline and after PCC time points.
Similarly, other additional conservative therapies, including
intravenous vitamin K, were administered to some but not all
patients, based on our experience with PCCs in emergency
surgical patients over many years. Furthermore, intravenous
administration of vitamin K would not be expected to have an

impact within this four-hour period. No significant effects of
these additional treatments on INR were seen in any patient
group.
Another alternative to FFP for treatment of life-threatening
bleeding is activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa). This is
approved for use as a bypassing agent in hemophiliac patients
who have inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII or IX, but its use in
a broader range of applications in life-threatening hemorrhage
has been extensively reported [40]. However, rFVIIa only
replaces a single factor, and its principle mechanisms of action
are dependent on adequate levels of other coagulation fac￾tors, in particular factors II and X, and fibrinogen [24].
The data obtained in this study do not provide information on
the speed of INR correction following administration of PCC;
they merely represent clotting measurements at a specific time
in a given setting (mainly after surgery has been performed and
the patient has been transferred to the surgical ward for post￾surgical care). However, the data do suggest that correction
of INR and cessation of bleeding can be achieved with PCC
in less than three hours. In a recent pharmacokinetic study,
administration of PCC (Beriplex P/N®; dose 50 IU factor IX/
kg) to 15 healthy volunteers resulted in a maximal increase in
coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X within five minutes of
administration, suggesting that PCC has a rapid onset of
action [41]. This increase in clotting factors remained stable
over the next six hours and declined slowly over the next six
days. One factor that will influence the speed of INR correction
with PCCs is body temperature. Hypothermia inhibits the syn￾thesis of fibrinogen and the initiation phase of thrombin gener￾ation [42] so normothermia is important for effective
hemostasis [42]; all patients were normothermic at the begin￾ning of PCC application in our study.
The magnitude of INR reduction in bleeding patients was not
as large as that seen in the anticoagulation reversal group.
This is likely to be due largely to a lower baseline INR in the
bleeding group (1.7 vs 2.8 in the anticoagulation reversal
group), but it could also be attributed to a higher volume appli￾Figure 5

cation in the reversal patients, different consumption of coag￾ulation factors or cardiocirculatory instability following
activation of coagulation.
The dose of PCC administered was significantly higher in
bleeding patients than in anticoagulation reversal patients.
This was probably because bleeding patients were incurring
major blood loss, whereas anticoagulation reversal patients
were only receiving PCC as bleeding prophylaxis. Therefore,
higher doses were administered in an attempt to control a
more urgent and immediate clinical situation. As described
above, the target INR in bleeding patients was also lower than
in the anticoagulation reversal patients, necessitating higher
PCC doses in an attempt to achieve the lower target.
Measurements of serum creatinine and bilirubin did not sug￾gest any detrimental effects of PCCs on kidney or liver func￾tion. With the exception of hemoglobin in bleeding patients
and CRP in reversal patients, laboratory safety parameters
were not increased from baseline values following infusion of
PCC. The increase in hemoglobin concentrations in the bleed￾ing group may be explained by the higher and more frequent
use of RBC concentrates compared with the anticoagulation
reversal group and by the eventual cessation of bleeding in
these patients. Unsurprisingly, baseline hemoglobin levels
were lower in bleeding patients due to the severe blood loss
incurred. Baseline serum creatinine and bilirubin concentra￾tions were also lower in bleeding patients, most likely for the
same reason. The significant increase of CRP concentration in
the anticoagulation reversal patients is probably due to the
operative procedure that followed optimization of coagulation.
In contrast, bleeding patients did not show an increase in CRP
after PCC application, despite receiving higher doses of PCC
on average. It therefore seems highly unlikely that PCCs
induce inflammatory activation.
Although there is a small, and to a certain degree inherent, risk
of thromboembolic events when PCCs are used for anticoag￾ulation reversal [2,9,20], there was no evidence of any throm￾boembolic complications in this study. There was also no
evidence of viral transmission, something that is very rarely
reported with PCC therapy, in any of the patients in this study
[2]. Effective virus inactivation and reduction processes are
reported for the study drug, which make transmission of infec￾Figure 7

tive agents, including prions, less likely [19]. These results and
those reported in other similar studies suggest that Beriplex P/
N® has a favorable safety profile with a low risk of thromboem￾bolic complications [8,30,31,35].
Conclusions
PCCs can effectively improve INR in non-hypothermic surgical
patients requiring vitamin K antagonist reversal or those expe￾riencing severe bleeding. In almost all patients, the improve￾ment in coagulation was judged to be clinically significant, and
allowed operative and/or interventional procedures to be per￾formed. Thus, PCC application in anticoagulation reversal and
bleeding surgical patients appears to be effective with a favo￾rable safety profile and, as such, warrants further prospective
evaluation.

Key messages
• This study shows that PCC therapy effectively reduces 
INR among patients requiring urgent vitamin K antago￾nist reversal, and those with severe bleeding.
• The improvement in coagulation produced by low doses 
of PCC was clinically significant, and allowed operative 
and/or interventional procedures to be performed with￾out major bleeding.
• The use of PCC among patients with severe bleeding is 
novel and warrants further evaluation.
• The safety of PCC therapy was favorable in this study, 
with no thrombotic events or changes in organ function 
reported in any patient.
