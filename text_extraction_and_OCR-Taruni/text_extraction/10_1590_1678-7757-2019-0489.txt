Risk factors for oropharyngeal 
dysphagia in cardiovascular diseases
Some conditions consolidated as risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia 
have already been identified in other diseases, such as neurological. Studies 
on cardiovascular diseases concentrate in individuals in the postoperative 
period; thus, it is unknown if these same factors occur in individuals 
hospitalized for clinical or surgical treatment of these diseases. Objective: 
to correlate predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia in individuals 
with cardiovascular disease admitted at a reference cardiology hospital. 
Methodology: This is a retrospective clinical study. Medical records of 175 
individuals hospitalized for clinical and/or surgical treatment at a reference 
cardiology hospital from January to June 2017, attendants of the Speech￾Language Pathology and Nutrition team, were analyzed. Of these, 100 records 
were included in the study: 41 females and 59 males (mean age 67.56 
years). Deaths and individuals from 0 to 18 years were excluded. Stroke, 
malnutrition, age and prolonged orotracheal intubation were considered 
predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia. Mann-Whitney test and 
Fisher's test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Stroke (OR=2.93 
p=0.02), malnutrition (OR=2.89 p=0.02) and prolonged orotracheal 
intubation (OR=3.94 p=0.02) were statistically significant predictors 
for oropharyngeal dysphagia within this population. Age below 80 years 
was not significant (p=0.06), but within octogenarians, significance was 
found (p=0.033). Conclusion: Stroke, malnutrition, prolonged orotracheal 
intubation and age > 80 years are predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal 
dysphagia in adult population with cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
mortality worldwide.1,2 Among its treatments, there 
is a clinical and/or a surgical option, often requiring 
prolonged hospitalization. Oropharyngeal dysphagia 
incidence in the population with cardiovascular disease 
varies from 2.7% to 51%,3,4 and most studies have 
investigated this population within the postoperative 
period.5,6 Regardless of the underlying disease, 
oropharyngeal dysphagia may be associated with 
several conditions of hospitalized patients and other 
clinical conditions associated with cardiovascular 
disease. 7,8
General evaluation of hospitalized patients 
includes nutritional status. Many may present 
unintentional weight loss due to malnutrition and low 
muscle strength, increasing the risk of developing 
oropharyngeal dysphagia. In addition, malnutrition is a 
frequent complication, as a result of specific difficulties 
on swallowing, compromising caloric intake levels.9
Some studies proposed the evaluation of nutritional 
status to predict the risk of dysphagia due to the 
significant association between these two conditions, 
in older adults.10 Malnutrition was also recently 
considered an independent predictor for dysphagia in 
population with heart failure.11,12
Potential risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia 
in cardiovascular disease populations are: advanced 
age,13 prolonged orotracheal intubation (OTI)14,15 and 
neurological diseases, such as stroke. OTI in cardiac 
surgery was considered a potential risk to increase the 
degree of swallowing impairment,4 not only due to the 
surgical procedure, but also the clinical and respiratory 
decompensation. As for stroke, oropharyngeal 
dysphagia prevalence is high and, although widely 
studied,16,17 it is rarely associated to the population 
with cardiovascular disease.18
The conditions described above have already been 
identified as risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia. 
However, in cardiovascular disease, most previous 
studies include individuals in postoperative period 
only5,6,14,15,19 or report oropharyngeal dysphagia after 
aortic region impairment. Thus, there are no studies 
about swallowing disorders during hospitalization for 
cardiovascular disease treatment, making it necessary 
to find out whether these predictive risk factors occur 
in hospitalized patients being medically managed for 
this disease. Therefore, this study aims to correlate 
predictive risk factors with oropharyngeal dysphagia 
in individuals with cardiovascular disease hospitalized 
at a reference cardiology hospital. 
Methodology
In total, 175 medical charts records of patients 
with cardiovascular diseases hospitalized for clinical 
or surgical follow-up at a public reference hospital in 
cardiology from January to June 2017. All patients 
were also evaluated by the Speech-Language 
Pathology and Nutrition team. Of these, 100 records
of individuals with oropharyngeal dysphagia were 
included, 41 females and 59 males (mean age 67.56 
years); 75 individuals were excluded due to deaths 
and age (from 0 to 18 years old). All patients were 
referred for speech therapy evaluation by the physician 
who identified some risk for dysphagia, based on risk 
criteria of the service, and the length of stay ranged 
from 5 to 40 days. All patients were followed-up by 
the speech therapy team. Of the patients included, 
66 were hospitalized for clinical treatment for several 
causes, including decompensated heart failure, acute 
myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute 
chronic renal disease, infective endocarditis, among 
others;, and whereas 34 patients were hospitalized 
for surgical treatment, such as valve, coronary heart 
disease, vascular surgeries, pacemaker and heart 
transplantation. Some of the patients submitted to the 
surgical procedure had a stroke during the intra- and 
postoperative periods, as described in Table 1. 
This is a retrospective clinical study approved 
by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute 
(Protocol No. 4776/2017). As a retrospective 
study with database, the informed consent was 
not required. Data collection on oropharyngeal 
dysphagia was performed by the analysis of clinical 
evaluation protocol for oropharyngeal dysphagia of the 
hospital. It was performed by two Speech-Language 
pathologists with over 10 years of expertise in 
dysphagia. Clinical oropharyngeal dysphagia protocol 
consisted of identification data, personal history, 
diagnosis, history of pulmonary disease, feeding 
route, language screening, vocal screening, indirect 
evaluation by the observation of sensory and orofacial 
motor performance, and direct evaluation of the 
biomechanics of swallowing through the use of multiple

consistencies and volumes of food. Swallowing was 
considered functional when the patient did not present 
impairments in any phases. Oropharyngeal dysphagia 
was diagnosed when one of the oral and/or pharyngeal 
phases was impaired, with or without clinical 
signs suggestive of penetration and/or aspiration 
(coughing, choking, throat clearing, wet voice), but 
with nutritional and/or laryngotracheal aspiration 
risks. Oropharyngeal dysphagia was classified as 
mild (impairment in oral and/or pharyngeal phases 
without clinical signs suggestive of penetration and/
or aspiration), moderate (impairment in oral and/or 
pharyngeal phases with clinical signs suggestive of 
penetration and / or aspiration) or severe (impairment 
in oral and/or pharyngeal phases with clinical signs 
suggestive of penetration and/or aspiration in more 
than one food consistencies).16
Nutritional data were collected by the nutrition 
team through clinical nutritional assessment protocols, 
based on body mass index (BMI) classification.20
To analyze predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal 
dysphagia, parameters were stroke, nutritional status 
(malnourished, eutrophic and obese), age and OTI 
time equal to or greater than 48 hours. 
Results
Mann-Whitney’s test and Fisher’s test were 
used for the statistical analysis of results; and 
odds ratio statistics (O.R) for categorical data analysis. 
Univariate and multivariate were used to analyze risk 
factors associated with dysphagia.
Table 2 shows that 46% of the individuals had 
oropharyngeal dysphagia and, among these, 58.7% 
were moderate level.
Table 3 shows that 35% of patients were 
malnourished, 26% had stroke, 39% had prolonged 
intubation and 82% were over 60 years old.

a relationship between dysphagia and malnutrition 
(OR=2.89 p=0.02) and dysphagia and stroke (OR=2.93 
p=0.02). When data were submitted to multivariate 
analysis (B), a relationship was also identified between 
dysphagia and malnutrition (OR=2.70 p=0.03) and 
dysphagia and stroke (OR=3.23 p=0.02). There was 
no significant relationship between dysphagia and age 
(p=0.06), but Univariate Analysis showed significance 
when the octogenarian group was analyzed (OR=3.45 
p=0.033) and Multivariate Analysis found values near 
the significance (OR=2.569, p=0.122). The analysis 
of the subgroup of patients that have been intubated 
showedno significant relationship between dysphagia 
and prolonged orotracheal intubation when considered 
OTI > 48 hours (OR=2.25 p=0.46), but there was 
significance when considered OTI> 5 days (OR:3.94 
p=0.02).
Discussion
Investigation about oropharyngeal dysphagia in 
population with cardiovascular disease is outnumbered 
when compared to other underlying diseases. 
Prevalence within literature varies from 2.7% to 51%, 
which may be related to the method used by each 
study in the investigation of dysphagia.3,4
In this study, 46% of individuals with cardiovascular 
diseases presented some degree of swallowing 
impairment. Although this prevalence is within 
the broad range found in the literature for this 
population,21 we consider it high. This could be a 
result of the inclusion of patients not only submitted 
to surgical procedure, like most of the studies, but 
in clinical treatment too. Besides that, the high 
frequency of oropharyngeal dysphagia in our study 
could be because our hospital possess the previous 
positive-screening of dysphagia for Speech-Language 
Pathology assessment. Dysphagia screening can help 
the team not to miss any patient.
Predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia, 
in this population, that reached statistical significance 
were stroke, malnutrition and prolonged intubation.
Our findings corroborate with studies which show 
that stroke is a clinical condition strongly associated 
with dysphagia.17 The variable incidence in this 
population is due to the location and extent of the 
lesion, as well as different investigation methods used, 
with some studies reporting up to 90% incidence.22 
Thus, the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in 
cardiopathy population is closely related to the co￾morbidity of stroke, whether or not it is associated with 
surgery. The generalization of dysphagia in cardiopathy 
populations deserves further discussion.
Another very important and significant clinical 
condition in this study was malnutrition. At hospital 
admission, malnutrition ranges from 20% to 60% and 
may increase even more in patients with prolonged 
hospitalizations for clinical and surgical treatment, with 
a higher incidence among elderly, due to other risk 
factors associated with this population.23,24 According 
to literature, aging is responsible for the reduction 
of caloric intake and progressive weight loss, due to 
catabolic state related to heart failure. Thus, many 
patients may present nutritional deficits prior to 
hospitalization and, when combined with undiagnosed 
dysphagia, it contributes to worsening patient’s 
prognosis in a hospital setting.23
It is known that oropharyngeal dysphagia can result 
in malnutrition, what can also be considered a cause 
of dysphagia. Malnutrition directly impacts the loss of 
muscle mass, impairing functions of muscles involved 
in swallowing and breathing and increasing the risk 
of oropharyngeal dysphagia.13 In our sample, 35% 
of evaluated patients were malnourished and there 
was a strong statistical relationship with dysphagia

(OR=2.89 p=0.02). Literature reports that 71% of 
hospitalized patients at risk for dysphagia, regardless 
of etiology, present alterations in nutritional status.25
Although dysphagia represents an important risk factor 
for malnutrition, malnutrition effects on swallowing 
among individuals with cardiovascular diseases 
remains under study. A recent study with patients with 
congestive heart failure identified that dementia and 
malnutrition are independent predictors of dysphagia 
in elderly people admitted to hospitals: two-third had 
malnutrition or nutritional risk, and one-third had risk 
for dysphagia.24
Age was not a significant factor associated with 
dysphagia in this study, which can be explained by the 
fact that sample is predominantly made of the older 
people, as aging is already considered a risk factor for 
the cardiovascular diseases development (p=0.033). 
This corroborates with the literature, which states 
that the progressive physiological aging of structures 
involved in swallowing process, associated with other 
comorbidities such as malnutrition, cardiovascular 
disease, stroke and prolonged hospitalizations 
negatively impact swallowing, generating risk for 
oropharyngeal dysphagia.13
Long-term orotracheal intubation, significant in 
this study when exceeding 5 days and a tracheostomy 
tube, is considered a predictive risk factor for 
dysphagia, frequently cited as the cause of it in 
population submitted to heart surgery. Furthermore, 
it is extremely important to consider intubation not 
only within surgical context, but also in patients with 
cardiopathy hospitalized for clinical treatment, as they 
may need long periods of intubation.4,18,26,27 
The present study has its limitations.It was 
not possible to categorize possible cardiovascular 
clinical alterations, as well as the type of cardiac 
surgery, considering the variability of the sample. In 
addition, extracorporeal circulation time, the need for 
transesophageal echocardiography, and associations 
with other comorbidities such as dyslipidemias, 
COPD, among others, cited as risk factors for 
dysphagia in this population, were not analyzed.8,18
Another limitation was the method use to evaluate 
swallowing, since clinical protocols have 73% to 98% 
accuracy.28 On the other hand, evaluation performed 
by qualified professionals is able to identify alterations 
in the physiology of swallowing dynamics, phases 
involved, degree of impairment, as well as indicate 
the complementary evaluation, if necessary. Thus, 
patients with cardiovascular disease admitted for 
surgical procedures or medical management can 
present or develop risk factors for dysphagia. This 
study identified risk factors as: malnutrition, stroke, 
prolonged intubation and age > 80 years. Patients 
presenting these should be closely monitored 
by a multidisciplinary team to minimize possible 
complications of dysphagia.
Conclusion
Stroke, malnutrition, prolonged intubation and age 
> 80 years are predictive risk factors for oropharyngeal 
dysphagia in adult populations with cardiovascular 
disease.
