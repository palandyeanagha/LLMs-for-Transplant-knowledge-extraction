Abstract
Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity associated with
increased arterial stiffness. Plasma aldosterone levels are increased in CKD, and aldosterone has been found to increase
vascular inflammation and fibrosis. It was hypothesized that aldosterone receptor inhibition with eplerenone could reduce
arterial stiffness in CKD stage 3–4.
Study Design: The design was randomized, open, parallel group. Measurements of arterial stiffness markers were
undertaken at weeks 1 and 24.
Intervention: 24 weeks of add-on treatment with 25–50 mg eplerenone or standard medication.
Outcomes: Primary outcome parameter was carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Secondary outcomes were
augmentation index (AIx), ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and urinary albumin excretion.
Results: Fifty-four CKD patients (mean eGFR 36 mL/min/1.73 m2
, SD 11) were randomized. Forty-six patients completed the
trial. The mean difference in cfPWV changes between groups was 0.1 m/s (95%CI: 21.0, 1.3), P = 0.8. The mean difference in
AIx changes between groups was 4.4% (0.1, 8.6), P = 0.04. AASI was unchanged in both groups. The ratio of change in
urinary albumin excretion in the eplerenone group compared to the control was 0.61 (0.37, 1.01), P = 0.05. Four patients
were withdrawn from the eplerenone group including three because of possible side effects; one was withdrawn from the
control group. Mild hyperkalemia was seen on three occasions and was easily managed.
Limitations: The full planned number of patients was not attained. The duration of the trial may have been too short to
obtain full effect of eplerenone on the arteries.
Conclusions: Add-on treatment with eplerenone in CKD stage 3–4 did not significantly reduce cfPWV. There may be
beneficial vascular effects leading to attenuated pulse wave reflection. Treatment was well-tolerated.

Introduction
Arterial stiffness is increased in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) compared to the background population [1]. This
adds to the increased burden of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality in CKD. Aortic stiffness reversibility in response to blood
pressure (BP) lowering has been shown to have a beneficial impact,
which is independent of level of BP lowering on the survival of
chronic haemodialysis patients and provides a potential treatment
target [2]. Markers of arterial stiffness have been found to be
independent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in
patients with CKD and hypertension as well as in the general
population [3–10]. Attenuation of arterial stiffness has been
achieved by treatment with blockers of the renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) in patients with diabetes, hypertension and end stage
renal disease (ESRD) [2,11–14].

Aldosterone has pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in
extra-renal tissues including blood vessels and increased plasma
levels of aldosterone are found in patients with CKD [15–17]. In
rats supplied with aldosterone and salt, attenuation of aortic
stiffness was reported after treatment with the selective aldosterone
receptor blocker eplerenone [18]. Studies in human hypertension
on resistance vessels and carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity
(cfPWV) have reported decreased vessel stiffness following
treatment with eplerenone [19,20]. A recent study in patients
with CKD stage 2–3 reported a decrease of arterial stiffness after
treatment with spironolactone, a non-selective aldosterone inhib￾itor added on to RAS-blockade and compared to placebo [21].
The primary aim of the present study was to test the effect of 24
week add-on eplerenone in CKD stage 3–4 on arterial stiffness
parameters.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency, the Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark
and the Danish Medicines Agency. The study was registered in the
www.clinicaltrials.gov database, registration number
NCT01100203. The study was carried out according to the
Helsinki Declaration and written informed consent was obtained
from all patients prior to inclusion.
Subjects and Methods
Design
The study was carried out in a randomized, open-label, parallel
group design comparing an intervention group receiving epler￾enone with a control group over a 24 week period. Randomization
was done by the GCP-unit, University of Copenhagen.
Study Participants
Before inclusion, patients were screened by blood samples and
pulse wave measurements. Kidney function (eGFR) was evaluated
by the CKD-EPI formula [22]. Inclusion criteria were age 18 to 80
years; eGFR 15–59 mL/min/1.73 m2
; untreated BP.130/
80 mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive drugs. Exclusion criteria
were: plasma (p2) potassium .5.0 mEq/L; allergy to aldosterone
antagonists; chronic liver insufficiency; ongoing treatment with
CYP3A4-inhibitors, lithium or immunosuppressive agents includ￾ing steroids; invalidating psychiatric disorders; other severe non￾renal disease; implantations of vascular stents in the aorta, brachial
or radial arteries; non-sinus rhythm; immeasurable pulse ampli￾tude; limb amputations; woman of childbearing potential not using
approved contraception; pregnancy or breast-feeding. Withdrawal
criteria were pregnancy despite contraception during the study
period; serious non-renal disease, and p–potassium .5.5 mEq/L
persisting at extra control visits within one week, despite dietary
instructions or treatment with furosemide; increase of p-creatinine
above 30% from baseline value at two consecutive visits;
unacceptable side effects; and wish for withdrawal from the
participant or non-compliance. Patients were recruited from two
outpatient clinics and all patients were seen by the principal
investigator.
Study protocol
Data collection at baseline included history of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), previous and current smoking habits, medication
and demographics. Patients were seen at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20
and 24. In the eplerenone group, treatment was administered as
add-on to ongoing therapy. The dose was 25 mg once daily for the
first week and raised to 50 mg once daily for the remaining 23
weeks. The BP goal was ,130/80 mmHg. In case of symptomatic
hypotension, reductions in antihypertensive therapy were primar￾ily made in non-RAS-blocking agents and in case of BP above
target non-RAS-blocking agents were added. In case of hyperka￾laemia (p-potassium .5.5 mEq/L), patients were given dietary
instructions and increased doses of furosemide and were subse￾quently seen at extra control visits.
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Outcome parameters
The primary endpoint was change in cfPWV after 24 weeks.
Secondary endpoints derived from pulse wave analysis (PWA)
were changes in augmentation indices: AIx and AIx@HR75 (see
methods for description), and ambulatory arterial stiffness index
(AASI) derived from 24 hour (24 h) ambulatory blood pressure
measurements (ABPM). Other study parameters comprised
albuminuria based on 24 h urine samples collected at week 1
and 24. Office BP, p-potassium, p-creatinine and eGFR were
measured at every visit and applied as safety parameters.
Methods
Pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis. The
SphygmoCorH hardware and software (version 8.2, Atcor Med￾ical, Sydney, Australia) and an applanation tonometer containing
a high-fidelity micro-manometer (Millar SPT-301 tonometer,
Houston, Texas, USA) were used for measurement of cfPWV
and PWA as described elsewhere [23]. The recordings of the
peripheral wave form were accepted if the variations in pulse
height, diastole and pulse length were equal to or less than 7% as
calculated by the software and the mean pulse height was above
80 mV. A quality index provided by the software was to be 80%
or above. All recordings were made after 10 minutes of rest in a
supine position, and were made in duplicate by the same trained
observer on the right side of the patients.
The cfPWV was measured by recording the pulse wave at the
site of the femoral artery followed by recording at the carotid
artery along with simultaneous electrocardiograph recordings
(ECG). The distance on the surface of the patient was measured
from the suprasternal notch to the carotid and femoral arteries
respectively and measure points were marked to ensure equal
lengths of travel for the pulse wave at duplicate measurements
made on the same day. The algorithm in the software subtracts the
distances and PWVs are calculated with reference to the ECG.
The SphygmoCorH software provides a validated generalized
transfer function which performs all calculations of pulse wave
measurements obtained through the applanation tonometer. The
PWA included assessment of the augmentation index (AIx). The
AIx is the difference between the second (P2) and the first (P1)
systolic peaks expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure (PP)
and calculated as: ((P2-P1)/PP)*100. The AIx is dependent on
heart rate (HR) and is therefore also reported as a value
standardized to a HR of 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75). HR
at the pulse wave measurements as well as 24 h HR was recorded.
For the calibration of the pressure wave form in the general
transfer function systolic and diastolic BP was measured manually
as described below.
All measurements took place in the morning at 8 or 9 a.m. and
patients were without intake of morning medication or food/drink.
Blood pressure measurements. Each recorded BP was
based on three measurements after 10 minutes of rest. The first
measurement was discarded and the average of the last two was
used. Office BPs at the control visits were made with patients in
Eplerenone and Pulse Wave Reflection in CKD

the sitting position and at the pulse wave examination visits with
patients in the supine position. Cuff width was selected according
to arm circumference. All measurements were made by the
principal investigator using sphygmomanometry.
24 h oscillometric ABPMs were obtained after measurement of
pulse wave parameters. ABPM was made on the non-dominant
arm with SpaceLabs 90217 equipment. Recorders were pro￾grammed to obtain measurements every 15 minutes during the
daytime (8.00–23.00 hours) and every 30 minutes during the night
(23.00 to 8.00 hours).
Ambulatory arterial stiffness index. For calculation of the
AASI, the regression slope of diastolic on systolic BPs was
computed for each individual 24 h BP recording and AASI was
calculated as 1 minus the regression slope [4]. A minimum of ten
recordings during daytime and five during night time were
required.
Intervention. Dose titration of eplerenone from an initial
25 mg daily to 50 mg daily as maximal dose is recommended in
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). The dose was
chosen after considerations on safety regarding potential risk of
hyperkalaemia in CKD stage 3–4, as well as the intention of
studying BP independent effects of eplerenone rather than
reduction in arterial stiffness due to haemodynamic changes.
Blood and urine analyses. All biochemical analyses were
carried out at the Department of Clinical Chemistry at Herlev
Hospital.
Statistics. A sample size of 37 patients in each group was
estimated according to the following criteria: a power set at 0.8,
the level of significance at 0.05 and a minimal relevant difference
in cfPWV between the groups of 1 m/s and a standard deviation

(SD) of 1.5 m/s. Characteristics at baseline were compared by
independent samples t-test for continuous variables and Fisher’s
exact test for dichotomous variables. Changes in outcome
parameters were evaluated including only patients who completed
the full 24 weeks by independent samples t-test.
Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to compare the
changes in the two groups with adjustment for the baseline values
of the particular variable (as recommended by Vickers [24]).
Finally additional multiple regression analyses were carried out to
investigate the influence of parameters known to influence arterial
stiffness.
Laboratory data were pooled for control visits in order to
investigate differences between groups during the stable treatment
regime.
Data are presented as mean with standard deviations (SD) or
with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for mean. Urinary
albumin excretion was skewed and therefore log-transformed
prior to analysis. Baseline data are presented as geometric means
with 95%CI, and changes are presented as ratios with 95%CI.
Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software, version 20.
Results
Patients were recruited consecutively from April 2010 through
June 2011.
Patient characteristics
Fifty-four patients were included, and 46 completed the study.
Three patients were withdrawn by the investigator prior to the first
visit due to unexpected serious non-renal disease (one in the
treatment group and two controls). Five patients did not complete
the study, four in the eplerenone group and one in the control
group. In the eplerenone group, three patients were withdrawn
due to possible side effects: one due to recurrence of gout, one due
to a feeling of swollenness of the tongue and one patient due to
nausea, dizziness and general discomfort. The last withdrawal in
the eplerenone group was caused by other serious non-renal
disease resulting in acute renal failure. In the control group, one
patient was withdrawn due to a relapse of glomerulonephritis. This
left 22 patients in the eplerenone group and 24 patients in the
control group (Figure 1). Unfortunately, it proved not possible to
recruit the full planned number of patients within the time frame
and resources allotted to the study. There were no differences in
demographic data, and baseline values of vascular and laboratory
data were comparable between the groups (Table 1 and Table 2).
Quality of measurements
All pulse wave measurements and ABPMs fulfilled the quality
requirements.

Table 3 shows mean values with SDs after 24 weeks of the
various outcome parameters in the eplerenone and control groups.
Table 4 shows the mean differences in changes between groups
with 95% CI and P-values based on the multiple regression model
where the baseline values and adherence to eplerenone or control
group were entered as co-variates. Multiple regressions with
additional co-variates are shown in Table S1.
Pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis
The mean change in cfPWV during the study was 20.9 m/s
(21.9 to 0.1), N = 22, in the eplerenone group and 20.6 m/s
(21.5 to 0.3), N = 24, in the control group. The mean difference
between changes in the groups was 0.1 m/s (21.0, 1.3), P = 0.8
with adjustment for baseline values. Adjustment for values of
systolic BP, HR and diabetic status did not alter this finding. Mean
AIx for patients in the two groups together was 22% (19, 26) for
men and 27% (21, 32) for women. The mean change in AIx
during the study was 20.3% (23.7, 3.2) in the intervention group
and in the control group it was 3.2% (0.5, 5.8). The difference
between changes in the groups was 4.4% (0.1, 8.6), P = 0.04 in
favour of eplerenone.
Ambulatory arterial stiffness index
There was no significant difference in changes of AASI between
the groups.
Blood Pressure and heart rate
The 24 h systolic BP fell in the eplerenone group by 4.7 mmHg
(28.6, 20.8), and in the control group by 1.3 mmHg (25.5, 3.0).
The difference between changes in the groups was 3 mmHg (22,
8), P = 0.2. The 24 h diastolic BP, office systolic and diastolic BPs,
central BPs, as well as office BPs at control visits did not differ
significantly between the eplerenone and control group (Table 3).
Mean HR at baseline was 63 beats/min (59, 67), in the eplerenone
group and 64 (58, 69) in the control group, P = 0.8. There were no
significant changes between groups, P = 0.4. Mean 24 h HR at
baseline was 71 beats/min (66, 75) in the eplerenone group and 69
(65, 72), in the control group, P = 0.4. There were no significant
changes between groups, P = 0.07.
Safety parameters
The mean values of p-potassium, p-creatinine and eGFR for the
control visits did not differ significantly between the groups.
Increases were seen during eplerenone treatment in p-potassium
and p-creatinine, but changes were not significant (Table 4). The
change in creatinine clearance was not different between the two
groups, P = 0.3. In total three measurements of p-potassium were
above 5.5 mEq/L in the eplerenone group, maximum value 5.7
mEq/L, while in the control group two measurements of p￾potassium were above 5.5 mEq/L, maximum value 5.6 mEq/L.
During treatment mean p-potassium was 4.6 mEq/L (4.4, 4.7) in

the eplerenone group and 4.4 mEq/L (4.3, 4.6) in the control
group. The difference between changes in the groups was
20.2 mM (20.5, 0.0), P = 0.2.
24 h Urine collections
The mean change in urinary albumin excretion in the
intervention group was 240% (250, 227), while in the control
group it was unchanged, 0% (238%, 58%). The ratio of change in
urinary albumin excretion in the eplerenone group compared to
the control group was 0.61 (0.37, 1.01), P = 0.05 indicating a
relative decrease in 24 h urinary albumin excretion of 39% (63%,
21%) in the eplerenone group compared to the control group.
Adjustments for differences in BP and renal function (eGFR or
creatinine clearance), did not alter this.
Discussion
The present study shows that 24 weeks add-on of the selective
aldosterone receptor inhibitor, eplerenone, in CKD stage 3–4 had
no effect on cfPWV, but caused a significant effect on the pulse
wave reflection judged by AIx and AIx@HR75, which tended to
decrease in the eplerenone group and increased in the control
group.
The importance of changes in AIx in patients with ESRD has
previously been demonstrated. It was reported, that for every 10%
absolute increase in AIx the risk of all-cause mortality increased by
1.51 and CV mortality by 1.48 [10]. A similar result was found in
pre-dialysis patients [25]. Thus prevention of increase in AIx, as
shown in the present study, may have important prognostic
implications.
cfPWV was the same order of magnitude as in a previous study
by our group in CKD patients of similar age [26], and in both
studies cfPWV was higher than in healthy individuals of the same
age (10 m/s vs. 8 m/s) [27]. By contrast the baseline AIx levels in
the present study are of the same order of magnitude as found in
healthy individuals of comparable age [27], and is somewhat lower
than in our earlier study [26], possibly because of better BP control
and treatment with RAS-blockers in almost all patients. Still, the
elevated cfPWV demonstrates conduit artery remodelling with
room for improvement by therapeutic intervention. In clinical
studies eplerenone has been found to reduce stiffness in resistance
arteries and in the aorta in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients
with normal kidney function and in elderly hypertensive patients
[19,20]. Thus, treatment for one year with 50 mg eplerenone daily
reduced the in vitro stiffness in resistance vessels in gluteal biopsies
when compared to treatment with the beta blocker atenolol [19].
In another study, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and
eplerenone both caused significant reduction of cfPWV over 24
weeks, but the patients had very high baseline BPs and cfPWVs.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64549

reported [20]. A study in young normotensive, drug-free patients
with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and normal
kidney function showed an increased AIx, whereas cfPWV was the
same as in a normal control group [27]. It was proposed, that AIx
was higher than expected according to age and kidney function
due to early-onset changes in small resistance vessels, preceding
hypertensive and uremic remodelling in the larger conduit vessels.
This is in line with our results and Savoia et al [19] where the
lowering of AIx may be a result of eplerenone facilitating a
reduction in peripheral resistance, which has seemingly not lost its
adaptive abilities. A parallel group, placebo controlled study by
Edwards et al in 112 patients with CKD stage 2–3 reported
significant reductions in cfPWV (D0.8 m/s), and AIx (D 5.2%)
versus DcfPWV 0.1 m/s and DAIx 1.4% in the control group after
40 weeks of treatment with spironolactone [21]. Speculations on
reasons for our results differing from those of Edwards et al [21]
could be differences in pharmacological actions between epler￾enone and spironolactone as well as shorter intervention time and
a greater disease burden in the present study.
In the present study there were no changes in AASI, peripheral
(office and 24 h) or central BP. Within the eplerenone group both
24 h systolic and diastolic BPs were reduced, though the change
was only found to be significant for systolic BP. This may explain
why AASI was not changed, since the two parameters changed in
the same direction, and AASI is calculated from the regression line
of diastolic on systolic BP. It is of note, that the 24 h systolic BP is
almost identical to the office BP. This confirms a previous finding
by finding by our group [28], but is at variance with other studies,
where 24 h systolic BPs are normally found to be lower than office
BPs [28,29]. An explanation for this could be the lack of night time
dipping in patients with CKD [28,30].
The increase in arterial stiffness is a result of changes in the
extracellular matrix as well as the contractile elements in the vessel
wall. These processes are accelerated in CKD and ESRD, and
may in part be due to increased levels of aldosterone [31]. P￾aldosterone levels are increased in CKD. This applies to those who
are naı¨ve to treatment with RAS-blockers as well as to those in
such treatment [17,32]. Animal studies have shown that aldoste￾rone induces inflammation leading to vascular fibrosis and that
blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors reduce this response [18].
The present study also investigated 24 h urinary albumin
excretion, which was found in a previous study to be decreased
during 8 weeks of treatment with eplerenone [33]. After 24 weeks
the 24 h urinary albumin excretion was lowered by 40% in the
eplerenone group, but unchanged in the control group. This
difference did not reach statistical significance.
Safety evaluation showed increases in p-potassium and p￾creatinine, as well as a decrease in eGFR, but there were no
significant differences when compared with control patients and
generally, the treatment with eplerenone 50 mg once daily was
Table 4. Mean differences between eplerenone and control group after 24 weeks adjusted for baseline values.

well tolerated. Despite this, it is important that patients with
reduced renal function have potassium supplements withdrawn
and p-potassium monitored frequently when treatment with
eplerenone is initiated.
Limitations
The main limitation is that the number of patients needed
according to power calculations was not obtained. The closure of
the study was in no manner related to results or interim analysis.
The study was planned within a fixed time frame which it was not
possible to prolong. Power calculations were based on expected
difference in cfPWV. Therefore there may be risk of a type 2 error
concerning the lack of effect on that parameter. The difference in
AIx between the eplerenone and control groups was significant,
making sample size less of an issue. The duration of treatment time
may have been inappropriate for remodelling of the conduit
arteries, or the arterial stiffness may have been too advanced to
respond fully to eplerenone.
Conclusions
Add-on treatment with eplerenone in CKD stage 3–4 may have
beneficial vascular effects leading to attenuated pulse wave
reflection. The treatment was well-tolerated.
