Abstract
Case reports and case series are uncontrolled 
study designs known for increased risk of bias but 
have profoundly influenced the medical literature 
and continue to advance our knowledge. In this 
guide, we present a framework for appraisal, 
synthesis and application of evidence derived 
from case reports and case series. We propose a 
tool to evaluate the methodological quality of case 
reports and case series based on the domains of 
selection, ascertainment, causality and reporting 
and provide signalling questions to aid evidence￾based practitioners and systematic reviewers 
in their assessment. We suggest using evidence 
derived from case reports and case series to inform 
decision-making when no other higher level of 
evidence is available.
In 1904, Dr James Herrick evaluated a 20-year-old 
patient from Grenada who was studying in 
Chicago and suffered from anaemia and a multi￾system illness. The patient was found to have 
‘freakish’ elongated red cells that resembled a 
crescent or a sickle. Dr Herrick concluded that the 
red cells were not artefacts because the appearance 
of the cells was maintained regardless of how the 
smear slide was prepared. He followed the patient 
who had subsequently received care from other 
physicians until 1907 and questioned whether this 
was syphilis or a parasite from the tropics. Then 
in 1910, in a published case report, he concluded 
that this presentation strongly suggested a previ￾ously unrecognised change in the composition of 
the corpuscle itself.1
 Sickle cell disease became a 
diagnosis thereafter.
Case reports and case series have profoundly 
influenced the medical literature and continue to 
advance our knowledge in the present time. In 
1985, the American Medical Association reprinted 
51 papers from its journal that had significantly 
changed the science and practice of medicine 
over the past 150 years, and five of these papers 
were case reports.2
 However, concerns about weak 
inferences and the high likelihood of bias associ￾ated with such reports have resulted in minimal 
attention being devoted to developing frame￾works for approaching, appraising, synthesising 
and applying evidence derived from case reports/
series. Nevertheless, such observations remain the 
bread and butter of learning by pattern recogni￾tion and integral to advancing medical knowledge.
Guidance on how to write a case report is avail￾able (ie, a reporting guideline). The Case Report 
(CARE) guidelines3
 were developed following 
a three-phase consensus process and provide a 
13-item checklist that can assist researchers in 
publishing complete and meaningful exposition 
of medical information. This checklist encourages 
the explicit presentation of patient information, 
clinical findings, timeline, diagnostic assess￾ment, therapeutic interventions, follow-up and 
outcomes.3
 Yet, systematic reviewers appraising 
the evidence for decision-makers require tools 
to assess the methodological quality (risk of bias 
assessment) of this evidence.
In this guide, we present a framework to eval￾uate the methodological quality of case reports/
series and synthesise their results, which is partic￾ularly important when conducting a system￾atic review of a body of evidence that consists 
primarily of uncontrolled clinical observations.
Definitions
In the biomedical published literature, a case report 
is the description of the clinical course of one indi￾vidual, which may include particular exposures, 
symptoms, signs, interventions or outcomes. A 
case report is the smallest publishable unit in the 
literature, whereas case  series report aggregates 
individual cases in one publication.4
The median number of patients in articles with 
‘case series’ in the title was found to be seven 
(range 1–6432). The median (range) of the number 
of cases of articles with ‘case report’ as a publi￾cation type was four (1–178).5
 Case reports/case 
series are usually retrospective although can occa￾sionally be prospective, such as the Herrick’s first 
case report of sickle cell disease.1
 Case reports/
series can also define their subject by exposure 
or outcome (analogous to a cohort study and 
case–control study). Therefore, a specific number 
of patients, the temporal direction of follow-up 
or even the definition by case/exposure are not 
differentiating characteristics of case report/series. 
One unique feature, however, is that case report/
series are uncontrolled (non-comparative) and 
have a relatively small number of individuals.
If a case series is prospective, differentiating 
it from a single-arm uncontrolled cohort study 
becomes difficult. In one clinical practice guide￾line, it was proposed that studies without internal 
comparisons can be labelled as case series unless 
they explicitly report having a protocol before 
commencement of data collection, a definition of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, a standardised 
follow-up and clear reporting of the number of 
excluded patients and those lost to follow-up.6

Evaluating methodological quality
Pierson7
 provided an approach to evaluate the validity of a case 
report based on five components: documentation, uniqueness, 
objectivity, interpretation and educational value, resulting in a 
score with a maximum of 10 (a score above 5 was suggested indi￾cate a valid case report). This approach, however, was rarely used 
in subsequent work and seems to conflate methodological quality 
with other constructs. For case reports of adverse drug reac￾tions, other systems classify an association as definite, probable, 
possible or doubtful based on leading questions.8 9 These ques￾tions are derived from the causality criteria that was established 
in 1965 by the English epidemiologist Bradford Hills.10 Lastly, we 
have adapted the Newcastle Ottawa scale11 for cohort and case–
control studies by removing items that relate to comparability and 
adjustment (which are not relevant to non-comparative studies) 
and retained items that focused on selection, representativeness of 
cases and ascertainment of outcomes and exposure. This tool was 
applied in several published systematic reviews with good inter￾rater agreement.12–16
Proposed tool
The previous criteria from Pierson,7
 Bradford Hills10 and Newcastle 
Ottawa scale modifications11 converge into eight items that can be 
categorised into four domains: selection, ascertainment, causality 
and reporting. The eight items with leading explanatory questions 
are summarised in table 1.
For example, a study that explicitly describes all the cases 
who have presented to a medical centre over a certain period of 
time would satisfy the selection domain. In contrast, a study that 
reports on several individuals with unclear selection approach 
leaves the reader with uncertainty to whether this is the whole 
experience of the researchers and suggests possible selection bias. 
For the domain of ascertainment, self-report (of the exposure or 
the outcome) is less reliable than ascertainment using adminis￾trative and billing codes, which in turn is less reliable than clin￾ical records. For the domain of causality, we would have stronger 
inference in a case report of an adverse drug reaction that has 
resolved with cessation of the drug and reoccurred after reintro￾duction of the drug. Lastly, for the domain of reporting, a case 
report that is described with sufficient details may allow readers 
to apply the evidence derived from the report in their practice. 
On the other hand, an inadequately reported case will likely be 
unhelpful in the course of clinical care.
We suggest using this tool in systematic reviews of case 
reports/series. One option to summarise the results of this tool is 
to sum the scores of the eight binary responses into an aggregate 
score. A better option is not to use an aggregate score because 
numeric representation of methodological quality may not be 
appropriate when one or two questions are deemed most critical to 
the validity of a report (compared with other questions). Therefore, 
we suggest making an overall judgement about methodological 
quality based on the questions deemed most critical in the specific 
clinical scenario.
Synthesis of case reports/series
A single patient case report does not allow the estimation of an 
effect size and would only provide descriptive or narrative results. 
Case series of more than one patient may allow narrative or quan￾titative synthesis.
Narrative synthesis
A systematic review of the cases with the rare syndrome of 
lipodystrophy was able to suggest core and supportive clinical 
features and narratively summarised data on available treatment 
approaches.17 Another systematic review of 172 cases of the infre￾quently encountered glycogenic hepatopathy was able to char￾acterise for the first time patterns of liver enzymes and hepatic 
injury in this disease.18
Quantitative synthesis
Quantitative analysis of non-comparative series does not produce 
relative association measures such as ORs or relative risks but can 
provide estimates of prevalence or event rates in the form of a 
proportion (with associated precision). Proportions can be pooled 
using fixed or random effects models by means of the various 
available meta-analysis software. For example, a meta-analysis of 
case series of patients presenting with aortic transection showed 
that mortality was significantly lower in patients who underwent 
endovascular repair, followed by open repair and non-operative 
management (9%, 19% and 46%, respectively, P<0.01).19
A common challenge, however, occurs when proportions are 
too large or too small (close to 0 or to 1). In this situation, the 
variance of the proportion becomes very small leading to an inap￾propriately large weight in meta-analysis. One way to overcome 
this challenge is to transform prevalence to a variable that is 
not constrained to the 0–1 range and has approximately normal 
distribution, conduct the meta-analysis and then transform the 
estimate back to a proportion.20 This is done using logit transfor￾mation or using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transforma￾tion,21 with the latter being often preferred.20
Another type of quantitative analysis that may be utilised is 
regression. A meta-analysis of 47 published cases of hypocal￾caemia and cardiac dysfunction used univariate linear regression 
analysis to demonstrate that both QT interval and left ventric￾ular ejection fraction were significantly correlated with corrected 
total serum calcium level.22 Meta-regression, which is a regression 
Table 1 Tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case series
Domains Leading explanatory questions
Selection 1. Does the patient(s) represent(s) the whole experience of the investigator (centre) or is the selection method unclear to the extent 
that other patients with similar presentation may not have been reported?
Ascertainment 2. Was the exposure adequately ascertained?
3. Was the outcome adequately ascertained?
Causality 4. Were other alternative causes that may explain the observation ruled out?
5. Was there a challenge/rechallenge phenomenon?
6. Was there a dose–response effect?
7. Was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur?
Reporting 8. Is the case(s) described with sufficient details to allow other investigators to replicate the research or to allow practitioners make 
inferences related to their own practice?
Questions 4, 5 and 6 are mostly relevant to cases of adverse drug events.

in which the unit of analysis is a study, not a patient, can also 
be used to synthesise case series and control for study-level 
confounders. A meta-regression analysis of uncontrolled series of 
patients with uveal melanoma treated with proton beam therapy 
has shown that this treatment was associated with better outcomes 
than brachytherapy.23 It is very important, however, to recognise 
that meta-regression results can be severely affected by ecological 
bias.
From evidence to decision
Several authors have described various important reasons to 
publish case reports/series (table 2).7 24 25
It is paramount to recognise that a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of case reports/series should not be placed at the 
top of the hierarchy in a pyramid that depicts validity.26 The 
certainty of evidence derived from a meta-analysis is contingent 
on the design of included studies, their risk of bias, as well as 
other factors such as imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency and 
likelihood of publication bias.27 Commonly, certainty in evidence 
derived from case series/reports will be very low. Nevertheless, 
inferences from such reports can be used for decision-making. 
In the example of case series of aortic transection showing lower 
mortality with endovascular repair, a guideline recommenda￾tion was made stating ‘We suggest that endovascular repair be 
performed preferentially over open surgical repair or non-oper￾ative management’. This was graded as a weak recommendation 
based on low certainty evidence.28 The strength of this recommen￾dation acknowledged that the recommendation might not univer￾sally apply to everyone and that variability in decision-making 
was expected. The certainty in evidence rating of this recommen￾dation implied that future research would likely yield different 
results that may change the recommendation.28
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development 
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach clearly separates the certainty 
of evidence from the strength of recommendation. This separation 
allows decision-making based on lower levels of evidence. For 
example, despite low certainty evidence (derived from case series) 
regarding the association between aspirin and Reye’s syndrome 
in febrile children, a strong recommendation for using acetamin￾ophen over aspirin is possible.29 GRADE literature also describes 
five paradigmatic situations in which a strong recommendation 
can be made based on low quality evidence.30 One of which is 
when the condition is life threatening. An example of which 
would be using hyperbaric oxygen therapy for purpura fulminans, 
which is only based on case reports.31
Discussion
Guideline developers and decision-makers often struggle when 
dealing with case reports/case series. On occasions, they ignore 
such evidence and focus the scope of guidelines on areas with 
higher quality evidence. Sometimes they label recommenda￾tions based on case reports as expert opinion.32 We propose an 
approach to evaluate the methodological quality of case reports/
series based on the domains of selection, ascertainment, causality 
and reporting and provide signalling questions to aid evidence￾based practitioners and systematic reviewers in their assessment. 
We suggest the incorporation of case reports/series in deci￾sion-making based on the GRADE approach when no other higher 
level of evidence is available.
In this guide, we have made the case for publishing case 
reports/series and proposed synthesis of their results in systematic 
reviews to facilitate using this evidence in decision-making. We 
have proposed a tool that can be used to evaluate the method￾ological quality in systematic reviews that examine case reports 
and case series.
