Abstract
Background: The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment
for complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPEs) has
not been properly defined. Our aim was to compare the
efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate for 2 vs. 3 weeks in
patients with CPPE (i.e. those which required chest tube
drainage).
Methods: In this non-inferiority, randomized, double￾blind, controlled trial, patients with community-acquired
CPPE were recruited from two centers in Spain and, after
having obtained clinical stability following 2 weeks of
amoxicillin-clavulanate, they were randomly assigned to
placebo or antibiotic for an additional week. The primary
objective was clinical success, tested for a non-inferiority
margin of <10%. Secondary outcomes were the proportion
of residual pleural thickening of >10 mm at 3 months, and
adverse events. The study was registered with EudraCT,
number 2014-003137-25. We originally planned to ran￾domly assign 284 patients.
Results: After recruiting 55 patients, the study was termi￾nated early owing to slow enrolment. A total of 25 patients
were assigned to 2 weeks and 30 patients to 3 weeks of
amoxicillin-clavulanate. Clinical success occurred in the 25
(100%) patients treated for 2 weeks and 29 (97%) treated for
3 weeks (difference 3%, 95% CI −3 to 9.7%). Respective
between-group differences in the rate of residual pleural
thickening (−12%, 95%CI −39 to 14%) and adverse events
(−7%, 95%CI −16 to 2%) did not reach statistical significance.
Conclusions: In this small series of selected adult
patients with community-acquired CPPE, amoxicillin￾clavulanate treatment could be safely discontinued by
day 14 if clinical stability was obtained.

Introduction
Approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with commun￾ity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have accompanying pleural
effusions on chest radiographs, of which about one-third
are categorized as complicated parapneumonic effusions
(CPPEs) (i.e. pleural space drainage is required for cure)
[1]. Recommended empiric regimens for hospitalized non￾intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CAP include a
β-lactam agent plus a macrolide (or β-lactam plus a respira￾tory fluoroquinolone) [2]. However, it has been consistently
demonstrated that bacteriology of pleural infections is dis￾tinct from that of CAP [3]. In a recent systematic review,
Viridans streptococci, part of the normal flora of the mouth
and rarely associated with pneumonia, were the most com￾mon bacteria cultured from 1097 community-acquired pleu￾ral infections (32%), followed by pneumococci (22%),

Staphylococcus aureus (18.5%) and anaerobes (17.8%) [4].
Moreover, atypical microorganisms, which frequently cause
CAP, are very rarely detected in pleural fluid samples by
advanced molecular techniques [5]. Consequently, empirical
antibiotics chosen for community-acquired pleural infec￾tions usually consist of monotherapy with a β-lactam with
activity against anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate), or
a combination of β-lactam (e.g. ceftriaxone) and clindamy￾cin [6].
About 5–7 days of antibiotics are considered effective
enough for most CAP [7], though more than 70% of
patients hospitalized with CAP eventually receive anti￾biotic treatment exceeding this recommended duration
[8]. Conversely, the optimal duration of therapy for
CPPE is unknown. Most experts suggest a prolonged
course of 3 or more weeks of antibiotics [9]. Given the
lack of evidence available to guide the duration of treat￾ment in CPPE this randomized trial was designed to test,
for the first time, whether 2 weeks is non-inferior to
3 weeks.
Materials and methods
Study design and patients
The ODAPE (Optimal Duration of Antibiotics in Parapneumonic
Effusions; https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/
2014-003137-25/ES) was a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority
trial of 2 vs. 3 weeks of treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate in
adults with CPPE or empyemas. Initially, six centers pledged to
participate in the trial. However, four failed to enroll patients two
years after the trial started and were excluded from the study, which
was finally conducted at the remaining two academic centers in
Spain (Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital in Lleida, and
University Clinical Hospital of Santiago in Santiago de Compostela)
between March 2015 and March 2019. It was approved by the Ethics
Committee of each participating center (CEIC No. 1384), and all
patients included in the study provided written informed consent.
CPPE referred to those exudative effusions associated with pneumo￾nia which required chest tube drainage for resolution. Empyema
denoted pus within the pleural space. Decisions on whether to insert
a chest tube were based on the presence of any of the following
conditions: large (about half or more of the hemithorax) or loculated
effusions, purulent fluid, pleural fluid pH ≤7.20 (or alternatively
glucose <60 mg/dL), or microorganisms on pleural fluid Gram stains
or cultures. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with CAP
and an associated pleural effusion which met the criteria for being
classified as complicated as detailed above. Exclusion criteria included
pregnancy, allergy to amoxicillin-clavulanate, active tuberculosis, hos￾pital or health-care associated pneumonia, immunosuppression (e.g.
human immunodeficiency virus infection, transplantation, cancer
under active oncologic therapy, use of corticosteroids or
immunosuppressive drugs), non-parapneumonic empyema (e.g.
trauma, thoracic or abdominal surgery), life expectancy of less than
3 months, or isolation of bacteria resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Patients with CPPE were hospitalized in a non-ICU setting and
empirically treated with 2 g/200 mg intravenous amoxicillin-clavula￾nate every 8 h, which was switched to an oral route (tablets 875/
125 mg/8 h) based on clinical improvement (e.g. no fever for at least
24 h, normal vital signs, falling of serum C-reactive protein [CRP])
and feasibility of oral intake. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAID) and/or oral azithromycin for a maximum of 5 days in
combination with the β-lactam, as well as time of hospital discharge
were left to the discretion of the attending physician. Finally, intra￾pleural urokinase (100,000 U every 24 h for a maximum of 6 days)
was routinely used in the participating centers for loculated para￾pneumonic effusions and empyemas.
Randomization and treatment
At 14 days of β-lactam therapy, counting from the first day of its
administration, patients who had achieved clinical stability were
randomized to receive placebo vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate (powder for
suspension 875/125 mg/8 h) given orally for an additional week (inter￾vention period). Clinical stability at the time of randomization was
defined by all of the following: 1) temperature <37.80 °C, resting
pulse and respiratory rates lower than 100/min and 24/min, respec￾tively, and systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, for the last 48 h, 2) chest
drain already removed, 3) pleural effusion occupying less than 20% of
the hemithorax on a chest radiograph, and 4) reduction of >50% of the
serum CRP concentration at diagnosis.
Randomization was accomplished via a central, web-based system
(http://randomizer.org) using a computer-generated list of random
numbers in a 1:1 ratio, with permuted blocking and stratification by
center. The randomization list was prepared and kept at the
Pharmacy Service of the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital
which, along with the Pharmacy Service of the University Clinical
Hospital of Santiago, dispensed the allocated treatment. Antibiotics
and placebo were delivered in non-labeled identical envelopes in
powder form to be taken orally. An external pharmaceutical labo￾ratory (Defabar®, Desarrollos Farmaceúticos Bajo Aragón, SL) pre￾pared the placebo with the same taste, color and appearance as the
antibiotic. Patients and clinicians were blinded to treatment assign￾ment. At the end of treatment, patients were instructed to return the
empty envelopes to the Pharmacy Services to ensure adherence.
Researchers evaluated outcomes, which were based on objective
clinical, radiological and analytical data. External monitoring of
the study was done by SCTFarma from the Biomedical Research
Institute of Lleida (IRBLleida, http://www.irblleida.org/en/techni
cal-scientific-services/pharma/).
Outcomes
The primary end-point was the rate of clinical success, defined as
complete or almost complete resolution of symptoms (chest pain,
dyspnea) and signs (fever, serum CRP) at 1 week from randomiza￾tion, with no recurrence of clinical manifestations of pleural infec￾tion during follow-up. Conversely, persistent or recurrent symptoms
and/or signs of infection, need for further pleural procedures or

thoracic surgery, or death attributable to sepsis were designated as
clinical failure, provided they were related to the original pleuro￾pulmonary infection. Secondary outcomes, also assessed for non￾inferiority, were the lack of residual pleural thickening of >10 mm on
a posteroanterior chest radiographic view after 12 weeks from the
initiation of antibiotic therapy, and the safety of a longer course of
antibiotics.
Monitoring visits took place at days 1 (eligibility), 14 (random￾ization), 21 (end of intervention period; primary end-point and
adverse events), and 90 (primary end-point and residual pleural
thickening) from the initiation of antibiotics (Figure 1). They
included evaluation of: inclusion and exclusion criteria, demo￾graphics and comorbidities, respiratory symptoms (i.e. chest pain,
cough, and dyspnea using the Modified Medical Research Council
[mMRC] scale), vital signs, echographic pattern of the pleural fluid at
diagnosis (simple or complex), chest radiograph (effusion laterality,
pleural loculations, lung consolidation, percentage of the hemi￾thorax area occupied by the pleural opacity using image J software
[available at: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/], residual pleural thicken￾ing), biochemical and microbiological pleural fluid data, serum
CRP and leukocyte count, blood cultures, prognostic RAPID (renal,
age, purulence, infection source, and dietary factors) score [10] at
diagnosis, size of chest tubes, duration of chest tube drainage, doses
of intrapleural urokinase employed, use of NSAID and antibiotics
other than amoxicillin-clavulanate (e.g. macrolides), length of hos￾pital stay, transfer to ICU, referral for surgery, adverse events during
the study period, rehospitalizations, and deaths related to pleuro￾pulmonary infection.
Statistical analysis
The study was designed to have 80% statistical power (two-sided
alpha of 0.05) with a non-inferiority margin of 10% between the
short and extended antibiotic regimen branches. This non-inferiority
boundary is the most widely accepted in similar studies of compa￾rative antibiotic duration [11]. For a primary outcome event of 90%
[6], it was estimated that 284 patients would need to undergo
randomization. However, the enrollment rate was slower than
expected as a consequence of null recruitment in four of the initially
participating centers and strict eligibility criteria. Consequently, the
study was prematurely terminated, blinded to the clinical outcomes;
a circumstance which was communicated and accepted by the local
ethics and research committee (CEIC) on May 4, 2019. We calculated
95% confidence intervals (CI) of the difference between the clinical
success of the 2- vs. 3-week groups. The non-inferiority hypothesis
was considered proven if the 95% CI upper bound was less than 10%
points. Mann-Whitney and Fisher’s exact tests were used for numer￾ical and categorical data, respectively. All analyses were conducted
using SPSS 22.0 statistical software (Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Overall, 238 patients were recruited during the study
period, but only 55 (23%) were eligible for enrollment
on day 14 following antibiotic therapy (Figure 2). Among
the 183 patients who met the exclusion criteria, the most
common reasons for non-eligibility were the prescrip￾tion of antibiotics other than amoxicillin-clavulanate
(20%), the non-parapneumonic cause (e.g. post-surgery)
of the pleural infection (18%), the presence of cancer
(15%) or other immunosuppressive states (11.5%), and
the lack of clinical stability at randomization (11%). Of
the 55 patients who underwent randomization, 25 were
allocated to the 2-week antibiotic treatment regimen and
30 to the 3-week regimen.
Baseline characteristics between study groups were
balanced during the study period (Table 1) and, specifically,
at the time of randomization (Table 2). Overall, the 55
patients included in this trial had effusions which were
predominantly moderate to large in size (41% of the hemi￾thorax occupied by the effusion), loculated (82%), sono￾graphically complex (98%), visibly non-purulent (76%)
and culture-negative (67%). A total of 18 microorganisms
were isolated from their pleural fluids, including 11 Viridans
streptococci, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and one each of
Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. cohnii, Pasteurella

multocida, and Parvimonas micra. Patients were treated a
median of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 4–7) with intra￾venous antibiotics, and received small (80%) chest cathe￾ters that remained in place for 2 (1–4) days, along with
intrapleural urokinase (96%), NSAID (75%) and, less
often, a concomitant course of oral azithromycin (36%). At
the time of randomization, patients were afebrile (median
temperature 36 °C), had normal vital signs (median of 80
beats/min, 16 breaths/min and systolic blood pressure 130
mmHg), normal blood leukocyte counts (9330/µL, IQR
7290–10,550/µL), slightly elevated serum CRP (30 mg/L,
IQR 13–75 mg/L), and minimal pleural opacities on chest
radiographs (11% of the hemithorax, IQR 7–14%). At the
end of the intervention period (day 21), vital signs remained
stable while other preceding variables further improved or
normalized (Table 3).
Treatment adherence was optimal, since nearly all 21
envelopes were returned at the end of the intervention

placebo branch.
Clinical outcomes
In the intention-to-treat population, clinical success
occurred in all 25 patients in the 2-week treatment branch
(100%, 95%CI 86–100%) and 29 in the 3-week treatment
branch (97%, 95%CI 83–100%, p=0.36). Therefore, the
difference between groups for the primary outcome was
3% (95% CI −3 to 9.7%). Since the upper limit of the CI
was lower than 10%, the 2-week antibiotic therapy was
determined to be non-inferior to the 3-week therapy.
The only patient who failed antibiotic therapy
belonged to the 3-week branch and presented with a
growing fluid collection at the end of the intervention
period, which required a therapeutic thoracentesis along
with an additional 2-week course of amoxicillin-clavula￾nate. During follow-up 3 patients, also from the 3-week
branch, died after the original pleuro-pulmonary infec￾tion had already been cured: (a) one committed suicide
10 weeks after randomization, (b) another had a fatal
traumatic subdural hematoma 6 weeks after randomiza￾tion, and (c) a third was admitted to the ICU 8 weeks after
randomization because of septic shock, with bilateral
airspace opacities (without pleural effusion) and isolation
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in blood cultures; the initial
pleuropulmonary infection was produced by pneumococ￾cus, which was isolated in sputum cultures and also
detected in a urinary antigen test. No patient required
thoracic surgical intervention.
The last monitoring visit for the evaluation of one of
the secondary outcomes could not be performed in four
patients: the 3 who had died, and one who had moved to
another city, although he was contacted by phone and
remained asymptomatic. Among the 51 evaluable sub￾jects, a residual pleural thickening of >10 mm was seen
in 13 (59%, 95%CI 36–79%) and 20 (71%, 95%CI 51–87%)
patients from the 2- and 3-week branches, respectively
(difference −12%, 95%CI −39 to 14%). Consequently, the
upper bound of the 95%CI of the difference in percen￾tages of residual pleural thickening between groups did
not meet the non-inferiority criterion.
Two patients who had received antibiotics for 3 weeks
developed minor adverse events during the blind treat￾ment period: an oral candidiasis that was treated with
nystatin swish and swallow, and an antibiotic-associated
diarrhea unrelated to Clostridium difficile infection, both of
which resolved without having to discontinue antibiotics.
No significant differences were identified in the rate of

Discussion
Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold
standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of thera￾peutic interventions, but none have so far been con￾ducted to assess the optimal duration of antibiotic
therapy in patients with CPPE. The ODAPE trial suggests
that a 2-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate is at least
as effective as a 3-week course for those CPPE which meet
the entry criteria of the current study.
The 2010 British Thoracic Society guideline for the
management of pleural infections recognized that, despite
the lack of evidence on this issue, antibiotics are often
continued for 3 weeks [12]. More recently, the American
Association of Thoracic Surgery recommended a minimum
of 2 weeks of antibacterial therapy from the time of drain￾age and defervescence, based on expert opinion and
standard of care [13]. In a recent retrospective review of
91 patients with empyema, of whom 90% underwent a
thoracic surgical intervention, the median length of anti￾microbial therapy was 27 (IQR 15–31) days [14]. In another
series of 140 cases of pleural empyema, antibiotics were
administered for a median of 20 days [15].
Unnecessary prolongation of antibiotic therapy may
result in increased antibiotic selection pressure that can
affect resistance. Likewise, in the ODAPE trial patients
who received a longer course of antibiotics had a trend
towards developing more adverse effects, which was not
statistically significant most likely due to the insufficient
sample size. In a multicenter study of 6481 patients hos￾pitalized with pneumonia (73% with CAP), each excess
day of treatment was associated with a 5% increase in the
odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events reported by
patients after discharge (mostly diarrhea, gastrointestinal
distress and mucosal candidiasis) [8]. On the other hand,
the prevalence of residual pleural thickening at 3 months
from diagnosis was about 65%, a figure comparable with
that reported in other studies [16]. Nevertheless, this
complication has a limited functional impact [17].
It is noteworthy that virtually all patients were initially
treated with the instillation of urokinase through a small￾bore catheter that remained in place for a short period of
time (generally less than 3 days). This management is
routine in our practice [18, 19], yet it may differ somewhat
from other centers with regard to chest tube size and
indwell time, or the use of intrapleural agents. Although
the role of intrapleural fibrinolytics alone is still debatable
and their combination with DNase is more favored [6, 20], in
the ODAPE trial the influence of such a short course of
urokinase on the primary end-point was probably
negligible.
It should be acknowledged that this trial has limitations.
First, the early termination of the trial reduced the statistical
power and, owing to the restricted sample size, our findings
should be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, even pre￾maturely terminated trials can still yield meaningful results.
To be sure, we have been able to demonstrate non-inferiority
of 2 vs. 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy using a 10% non￾inferiority margin. Admittedly, the study was underpowered
to precisely evaluate secondary outcomes (i.e. adverse
events, residual pleural thickening). In addition, only 23%
of the initially screened patients were eventually enrolled
based on the strict entry criteria, which limits the general￾izability of the findings. Notably, the results are only valid for
a specific subset of patients with community-acquired CPPE,
namely those who have a bacterial pathogen non-resistant to
amoxicillin-clavulanate, do not have immunocompromise,
and are free of chest tubes and obtain clinical stability after
2 weeks of antibiotics. Longer courses of therapy may be
indicated in other situations.
In summary, this study is the first to show that for
patients with stabilized community-acquired CPPE and
no surgical requirement, 3 weeks of antimicrobial treat￾ment appears to have no clinical advantage over
2 weeks of antibiotics. Given the premature termination
of the trial, firm conclusions await further confirmatory
studies.
