Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR)
measured with PET have clinical value. SPECT cameras with
solid-state detectors can obtain dynamic images for measurement
of MBF and MFR. In this study, SPECT measurements of MBF
made using 99mTc-tetrofosmin were compared with PET in the
same patients. Methods: Thirty-one patients underwent PET
MBF rest–stress studies performed with 82Rb or 13N-ammonia
within 1 mo of their SPECT study. Dynamic rest–stress measure￾ments were made using a SPECT camera. Kinetic parameters were
calculated using a 1-tissue-compartment model and converted to
MBF and MFR. Processing with and without corrections for atten￾uation (1AC and 2AC), patient body motion (1MC and 2MC), and
binding of the tracer to red blood cells (1BB and 2BB) was eval￾uated. Results: Both 1BB and 1MC improved the accuracy and
precision of global SPECT MBF compared with PET MBF,
resulting in an average difference of 0.06 6 0.37 mL/min/g. Global
MBF and detection of abnormal MFR were not significantly im￾proved with 1AC. Global SPECT MFR with 1MC and 1BB had
an area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.90 (1AC) to 0.95
(2AC) for detecting abnormal PET MFR less than 2.0. Regional
analysis produced similar results with an area under the re￾ceiver-operating curve of 0.84 (1AC) to 0.87 (2AC). Conclusion:
Solid-state SPECT provides global MBF and MFR measurements
that differ from PET by 2% 6 32% (MBF) and 2% 6 28% (MFR).

PET measurement of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myo￾cardial flow reserve (MFR) has been shown to have incremental
benefit over relative myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for di￾agnosis (1–3) and prognosis (4–6). However, whereas 6.4 million
MPI studies are done annually in North America, less than 1% are
done with PET (7,8). Measuring MBF is difficult with traditional
SPECT cameras because of the limited sensitivity and lower tem￾poral resolution compared with PET. Despite these challenges,
dynamic acquisitions with rapid sequential rotations (9) and
spline-based 4-dimensional reconstruction approaches (10) have
demonstrated the potential for SPECT to provide accurate MBF
measurements. The introduction of dedicated solid-state cardiac
cameras greatly facilitates the acquisition protocol for dynamic
SPECT imaging because of their improved sensitivity and tempo￾ral resolution (11,12). Animal studies using microspheres have
shown that these solid-state cardiac cameras can accurately mea￾sure MBF using either 201Tl or 99mTc-based standard perfusion
tracers (13). Human studies have shown that indices of flow cor￾respond well with coronary angiography using sestamibi (14),
tetrofosmin (15), and thallium (16). Recently, a SPECT flow
index, measured using tetrofosmin, has shown good sensitivity
(70%) and specificity (78%) for detecting abnormal flow as
measured in the same patients with ammonia PET (17). To
convert indices of flow into MBF, the flow-dependent extraction
fraction for SPECT tracers in humans is needed.
We measured SPECT MBF with 99mTc-tetrofosmin, using a
dedicated cardiac SPECT camera and a Renkin–Crone model
for the extraction fraction, and evaluated the incremental value
of corrections for body motion, blood binding, and attenuation
against PET MBF measured in the same patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
We recruited 32 patients with known coronary artery disease. Each
patient underwent both PET and SPECT MPI studies within 1 mo.
One patient withdrew from the study before completing both sets of
images, and 2 studies were only partially available (1 rest list-mode
file was not saved, 1 stress injection had inappropriate timing), leaving
29 paired rest–stress and 2 unpaired studies (60 scans in total). The
average patient age was 64 6 11 y, and the mean body mass index was
27.9 6 4.7 kg/m2. Twenty-seven (87%) patients were men and
6 (19%) had diabetes mellitus. The study was approved by the Ottawa
Health Science Network Research Ethics Board, and all patients pro￾vided informed written consent.
PET Imaging
PET studies were acquired using either 82Rb (n 5 25) or 13N-ammonia (n 5 6), on a Discovery 690 PET/CT scanner (GE
Healthcare) according to our clinical protocol. The activity injected
at both rest and stress was 10 MBq/kg (82Rb) or 5 MBq/kg (ammonia).
Tracer was delivered mechanically as a 30-s bolus (82Rb) or as a rapid
bolus by hand (ammonia). MBF was based on data acquired over
8 min (82Rb) or 4 min (ammonia). Stress was induced using dipyr￾idamole (0.14 mg/kg/min for 5 min). Motion correction was applied as
described for the SPECT studies. Kinetic analysis was performed
using FlowQuant software with a 1-tissue-compartment model and
dual-spillover correction as per our clinical protocol (18).

SPECT Image Acquisition
SPECT data were acquired in list-mode using the Discovery NM530c
cardiac camera. Rest images were obtained for 11 min starting
immediately before injection of 316 6 71 MBq of 99mTc-tetrofosmin
(Fig. 1). The patient returned at 45 min after injection for a 5-min
static resting acquisition (corresponding to the standard time for
MPI). Without repositioning, the patient was stressed using dipyr￾idamole (0.14 mg/kg/min for 5 min) with 11 min of list-mode
data acquired starting immediately before the injection of
1,122 6 170 MBq of tetrofosmin. Both rest and stress injections
were delivered mechanically over 30 s. Finally, a standard set of
stress perfusion images was acquired at 45 min after tracer injec￾tion. The order of PET and SPECT scanning was based on camera
availability. The average difference in acquisition dates was
19 6 9 d, with 12 (39%) of the SPECT images obtained before
PET imaging.
SPECT Image Processing
Similar to our previous animal work (13), list-mode data were
rebinned into a dynamic series of projections (9 · 10, 6 · 15, and
4 · 120 s) and reconstructed using manufacturer-supplied iterative
reconstruction software (30 iterations), both with and without
CT-based attenuation correction (+AC and 2AC, respectively),
followed by Butterworth filtering (order 7, 0.37 cycles/cm). AC
used the CT map acquired during PET/CT imaging, which was
manually aligned with the SPECT image using online quality
assurance tools (13,19). Kinetic analysis was performed using
FlowQuant software (18) and applying a 1-tissue-compartment
model with spillover correction from blood to myocardium only.
The stress dynamic image series was corrected for residual rest
activity by subtracting a scaled version of the static rest image
acquired just before injection of dipyridamole. Analysis was per￾formed with and without binding of the tracer to red blood cells
(+BB and 2BB, respectively) using the function derived from a
porcine model (13), and scaled to correct for differences between
humans and pigs in the equilibrium plasma–to–whole-blood
(PWB) concentration (Eq. 1).

where t is time (min). In addition, images were processed with and
without motion correction (+MC and 2MC, respectively) where each
dynamic frame was visually compared, in midventricular coronal, sag￾ittal, and transverse planes, with a contour outlining the heart in the final
frame. The contour was adjusted using a manually defined count thresh￾old to align with the myocardial edge. A rigid-body translation (without
rotation) was applied frame by frame as needed to center the activity
within the contour.
The global left ventricular K1 values were fit to the PET plasma
flow (MBF · [1-hematocrit]) or MBF if a blood-binding correction
was not performed, using the Renkin–Crone model (parametrized by
a and b, Eq. 2) and a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm.

The model fit; accuracy of conversion of SPECT K1 to MBF; and
corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and an area under the receiver￾operating curve (AROC) for an abnormal PET global MFR of less than
2.0 (5) were assessed using 50 repeats of 2-fold cross-validation (20).
For 2-fold cross-validation, the patients are randomly divided into 2
groups. One group is used to estimate the model fit parameters, and
the other group is used to test the fitted model’s accuracy and vice
versa, giving 2 estimates of the model fit parameters and 2 evaluations
of accuracy. Fifty repetitions of the process generate 100 sets of
model parameters with associated accuracy measures. For each pa￾rameter or measure, the mean and SD of the 100 values give the
overall estimate for the value and its uncertainty. The mean fit param￾eters were used to calculate the MBF and MFR in each coronary
artery territory (regional MBF and MFR), and a similar analysis
was performed.
Differences in mean values were compared using paired t tests and
differences in variances with F tests. AROCs were calculated nonpara￾metrically with the trapezoidal rule, and regional AROC were compared
using the Mann–Whitney U statistic (DeLong approach) (21). A P value
of less than 0.05, adjusted using a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple
comparisons (n 5 12) to a P value of less than 0.004, was considered
significant.
RESULTS
The patient characteristics and relationship between SPECT K1
and PET MBF were similar for both PET tracers (Supplemental
Fig. 1; Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 [supplemental materials are
available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org]), and so the data were
pooled. The R2 of the Renkin–Crone model fit was between
0.61 and 0.75 for all methods (Fig. 2; Table 1) and was improved
with 1MC by an average of 0.05. 1MC significantly increased R2
over –MC for 6AC/1BB and 1AC/–BB (P , 0.001 for all), but
not for –AC/–BB (P 5 0.005). From the cross-validation analysis
(Table 1), 1MC increased the correlation of SPECT and PET
MBF by an average of 0.05 over –MC; the increase was significant
for 6AC/6BB (P , 0.001). 1MC reduced the SD of the MBF
difference in all cases (Table 1; Fig. 3; Supplemental Fig. 2).
The average increase in the R2 of the model fit due to BB was
0.06 (Table 1; Supplemental Fig. 1), and it was significant for
–AC/6MC (P , 0.001) but not for 1AC/6MC (P $ 0.007).
The average increase in the correlation between SPECT and
PET MBF due to BB was 0.06 and was significantly greater for
all cases (6AC/6MC, P # 0.001). 1BB reduced the SD of the
MBF difference. The change in SD was significant in all cases
except 1AC/2MC/2BB versus 1AC/2MC/1BB (0.55 vs. 0.48,
P 5 0.006).
With AC, the R2 of the model fit was lower than with –AC
for 6MC/1BB (P , 0.001) but greater for 1MC/–BB (P ,
0.001) and similar for –MC/–BB (0.63 vs. 0.61, P 5 0.13). The
correlations between SPECT and PET MBF were on average 0.02

worse for 1AC than for –AC. –AC significantly increased the
correlation for 6MC/1BB (P , 0.001) but not for 6MC/–BB
(P . 0.02). 1AC did not significantly change the mean or SD of
the MBF difference (Fig. 3) except for the SD with 2AC/1MC/
1BB versus 1AC/1MC/1BB (0.32 vs. 0.37, P 5 0.0001).
The slopes and intercepts of the linear fits between SPECT and
PET MBF were within 1 SD of 1.0 and zero, respectively, and were
not significantly different (Supplemental
Table 3). The changes in MBF relative
differences (difference/mean) were similar
to those for MBF difference (Table 1).
The global SPECT MFR from the cross￾validation analysis (Fig. 3; Supplemental
Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 4) had an AROC
(Fig. 4) that ranged from 0.87 to 0.98
(Table 2). 1MC consistently increased
AROC but the change was only significant
for –AC/1MC/–BB versus –AC/–MC/–BB
(0.98 vs. 0.88, P , 0.001). 1BB increased
AROC for –AC/–MC (0.93 vs. 0.88, P ,
0.001) but decreased AROC for –AC/1MC
(0.95 vs. 0.98, P , 0.001) and caused no
significant changes for 1AC/6MC. AROC
was consistently lower with 1AC than
–AC, with the changes all significant ex￾cept for –MC/–BB (P 5 0.19). Choosing
an operating point that gave the highest
sensitivity–specificity product yielded sen￾sitivities between 78% and 100% and spec￾ificities between 70% and 100% (Table 2).
Similar results were found for stress MBF
(Supplemental Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 5).
When regional MBF was considered,
there were no statistically significant
differences in the correlations between
SPECT and PET for any individual pair
of correction combinations (Table 3). However, in all cases,
1MC had a higher correlation than the corresponding –MC
(average difference, 0.06), 1BB had a higher correlation than
–BB (average difference, 0.07), and 1AC had a higher corre￾lation than –AC (average difference, 0.09). The highest correlation
was r 5 0.85, for 1AC/1MC/1BB. The mean residual difference
between regional SPECT MBF and PET MBF (Fig. 5) was not

significantly different for any pair of correction combinations,
except 1AC/1MC/1BB versus –AC/1MC/1BB (0.05 vs.
20.03, P , 0.001). The SD in the fit residual consistently
decreased with 1MC, 1BB, and 1AC, with some differences
reaching statistical significance (Table 3). The regional MFR
values, determined on the basis of the mean Renkin–Crone model
parameters (Table 1), gave consistently higher AROC with 1MC
and 1BB, but consistently lower AROC with 1AC. However, none
of the differences in AROC were statistically significant. For 1AC/
1MC/1BB, AROC was 0.84, with a 70% sensitivity and 86%
specificity. For –AC/1MC/1BB, AROC was 0.87, with a 78%
sensitivity and 80% specificity.
DISCUSSION
Our study showed that global MBF
measurements with SPECT (6AC/1MC/
1BB), using a solid-state cardiac camera,
correlated well (r 5 0.85–0.89) with PET
MBF measured in the same patients. Our
results agreed with an earlier study that cor￾related a SPECT flow index with ammonia
PET MBF (17). Our study extended the pre￾vious work by determining a suitable ex￾traction fraction correction to convert K1
to an actual measurement of MBF. In addi￾tion, we found that global MBF accuracy
was improved with MC and BB but not with
AC. Our data showed a mean residual dif￾ference in SPECT and PET MBF of 0.06 6
0.37 mL/min/g with all corrections. The
sensitivity and specificity for detection of
abnormal PET MFR was 100% and 80%,
respectively, with an AROC of 0.95 (with
2AC/1MC/1BB). Thus SPECT global
MBF may provide additional clinical diag￾nostic and prognostic benefit compared with
relative MPI, similar to PET, despite its re￾duced spatial resolution, sensitivity, and
tracer extraction fraction. Although similar
overall, there were instances of substantial
difference between SPECT and PET MBF
(Figs. 3 and 5). The value of SPECT MBF
to the interpretation of individual cases will
depend on its repeatability, which has yet to
be evaluated. Evaluation of the incremental
clinical value of measuring MBF and MFR with SPECT, and de￾termination of optimal thresholds for normal measurements, will
require further studies in a larger patient population.
Motion correction was found to consistently increase both the
R2 of the Renkin–Crone model fit and the correlation between
SPECT and PET MBF (Table 1). These results are consistent with
previous PET MBF motion studies that showed errors as large as
240% in MBF (22) and for which MC improved accuracy (22,23).
In our work, the reconstructed images were shifted to reduce
frame-to-frame motion, but the attenuation map was not realigned
to correct for motion-induced misregistration errors in the AC.
Additional benefit might be obtained if the misregistration AC
errors were also corrected. Cardiac and re￾spiratory motion correction were not per￾formed for either SPECT or PET scans,
and these corrections may enhance image
resolution and further improve MBF mea￾surement accuracy.
Population-based correction for blood
binding produced a consistent increase in
the model fit and the correlation between
SPECT and PET MBF. The Renkin–Crone
model suggests a physiologic basis for the
function that converts K1 to MBF. How￾ever, because the function parameters are
empirically fit, the estimated function can
also compensate for other factors, such as
BB, inherent in the data. For example,
FIGURE 3. Global SPECT MBF (A and B) and MFR (C and D) compared with PET, without
(−AC) (A and C) and with (1AC) (B and D) attenuation correction (n 5 31 patients [MBF], n 5 29
patients [MFR]). SPECT MBF values were calculated using mean of 50-repeat 2-fold cross￾validation fit with a Renkin–Crone model for extraction fraction. MFR is stress MBF/rest MBF.
Both motion and blood-binding corrections were incorporated in all kinetic analyses. Dashed

MBF measured using time-of-flight PET with model parameters
based on non–time-of-flight PET studies led to a 12% change in
the MBF values (24). Recalibrating the model parameters leads to
an improvement in the MBF values (25,26). The different Renkin–
Crone parameters given in Table 1 reflect the incorporation of
different factors such as tracer blood binding into the empiric
K1-to-MBF function, and not changes in physiology. However,
forcing these corrections into the form of the Renkin–Crone model
may not provide as accurate a compensation as applying the cor￾rections to the images themselves. A closer examination of cases
with larger differences between the 1BB and 2BB results showed
that the number of regions with nonphysiologic values (MFR , 0.9
or . 5) was greater, for example, with 2AC/1MC/2BB (12/87)
than for 2AC/1MC/1BB (3/87). Exclusion of the nonphysio￾logic regions, such as was done in Nkoulou et al. (17), might
improve the MBF and MFR correlations but also sacrifices infor￾mation from those cardiac segments. There are limited human data
on the Renkin–Crone parameters for tetrofosmin, but the 95%
confidence intervals for the parameters in Table 1 overlap with
those from the study by Shrestha et al. (10) and animal studies
(13) (Supplemental Fig. 4; Supplemental Table 6).
Finally, AC was evaluated because most SPECT MPI studies
are acquired without concurrent transmission imaging. Also, AC
increases image noise, partly offsetting the gains in bias achieved
through decreased regional heterogeneity. Different approaches to
compensating for a lack of AC have been suggested: either

restricting measurement to the MFR wherein the ratio compen￾sates for regional attenuation effects (14,16), or normalizing so
that resting MBF has a predefined population value (15). Our data
suggest that an appropriate K1-to-MBF conversion function may
allow calculation of true global MBF even in the absence of AC.
Similar to studies with PET (27), our results indicated no consis￾tent benefit to AC in the accuracy of global MBF or AROC. The
myocardial tissue time–activity curve is a convolution of K1 with
the arterial input function (18). Thus, because the average atten￾uation for the myocardium and the input function are similar, the
global attenuation effects are largely cancelled out. There may,
nevertheless, still be variability in regional MBF due to regional
heterogeneity in the myocardial attenuation. Indeed, with regional
MBF, AC consistently increased the correlation with PET MBF
and consistently decreased the SD of the residuals (Table 3), sug￾gesting that AC improves regional MBF estimation. However,
because MFR is a ratio, it provides additional compensation for
regional changes in attenuation and consequently, the AROC for
detecting abnormal MFR from the regional analysis also shows no
benefit from AC. One limitation of this study is that the CT scan
used for AC was acquired during PET/CT imaging on a separate
day, and this may have reduced the accuracy of the SPECT AC. A CT
acquired in conjunction with the SPECT study might have improved
coregistration and so increased the benefit of AC for measuring MBF,
but confirming this would require further investigation.
The SPECT activity injected in this study corresponds to a
patient radiation dose of 10 mSv (28). At this dose, the SPECT
time–activity curves were similar in shape but noisier than the
PET time–activity curves (Supplemental Fig. 5). Pig studies sug￾gest that reducing the injected activity may be possible (29), but
further human studies are needed to determine the extent to which
patient dose can be reduced while main￾taining an accurate MBF estimate. In addi￾tion to higher noise, tetrofosmin has a
lower extraction fraction at high MBF,
which reduces the contrast in K1 between
normal and abnormal flow responses.
Techniques that reduce the uncertainties
in kinetic parameter estimation, such
as the 4-dimensional reconstruction ap￾proaches proposed for dynamic imaging
with conventional g-cameras (10), might
improve MBF estimation with dedicated
cardiac SPECT systems, but evaluation of
these algorithms will require additional
studies. A further consideration in our
study is that most of our subjects’ PET
MBF was done with 82Rb, which, although
used more commonly in the clinic, has a
reduced extraction fraction at high MBF
compared with ammonia. Both ammonia
and 82Rb have similar diagnostic accuracy
(3), but uncertainties in the PET flow mea￾surement may have reduced the measured
accuracy of the SPECT MBF. Despite a
similar clinical performance between tetro￾fosmin and sestamibi, our results cannot be
directly extended to sestamibi because we
are unaware of any data confirming the
extraction fraction function for sestamibi
in humans. A final consideration is that
the camera’s small field of view requires care in patient position￾ing to avoid truncation of the myocardium.
CONCLUSION
Measuring MBF and MFR in humans is feasible using a
dedicated cardiac SPECT camera. Corrections for motion and
tracer blood binding improved global MBF correlation and
precision with PET MBF. Global MBF and detection of abnormal
MFR were not significantly improved with 1AC. With all correc￾tions, SPECT global MBF and MFR differed from PET by 2% 6
32% (MBF) and 2% 6 28% (MFR).
