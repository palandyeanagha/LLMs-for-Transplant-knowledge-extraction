Abstract
Changes in levels of cytokines and chemokines have been proposed as possible biomark￾ers of tissue injury, including liver injury due to drugs. Recently, in acute drug-induced liver
injury (DILI), we showed that 19 of 27 immune analytes were differentially expressed and
that disparate patterns of immune responses were evident. Lower values of serum albumin
(< 2.8 g/dL) and lower levels of only four analytes, namely, IL-9, IL-17, PDGF-bb, and
RANTES, were highly predictive of early death [accuracy = 96%]. The goals of this study
were to assess levels of the same 27 immune analytes in larger numbers of subjects to
learn whether the earlier findings would be confirmed in new and larger cohorts of subjects,
compared with a new cohort of healthy controls. We studied 127 subjects with acute DILI
enrolled into the US DILIN. We also studied 118 subjects with severe acute liver injury of
diverse etiologies, enrolled into the ALF SG registry of subjects. Controls comprised 63 de￾identified subjects with no history of liver disease and normal liver tests. Analytes associated
with poor outcomes [death before 6 months, n = 32 of the total of 232 non-acetaminophen
(Apap) subjects], were lower serum albumin [2.6 vs 3.0 g/dL] and RANTES [6,458 vs 8,999
pg/mL] but higher levels of IL-6 [41 vs 18], IL-8 [78 vs 48], and MELD scores [30 vs 24]. Sim￾ilar patterns were observed for outcome of death/liver transplant within 6 months. A model
that included only serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL and RANTES below its median value of 11,349
had 83% (or 81%) accuracy for predicting early death (or early death/liver transplant) in 127

of acute liver failure, but there were cytokine patterns that predicted prognosis in both acute
DILI and ALF.
Introduction
Changes in levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines have been proposed as possible bio￾markers of tissue injury, including liver injury due to drugs [1] [2]. Indeed, alterations in cyto￾kine profiles have been reported in several experimental studies of DILI [3] [4]. In one study in
humans, genetic polymorphisms associated with lower production of IL-10, an anti-inflamma￾tory cytokine, were associated with lower eosinophil counts and poorer outcomes [2]. In an
earlier paper from the US DILI Network (DILIN), we showed that, among 78 subjects with
acute DILI, compared with 40 healthy controls, 19 of 27 immune analytes were differentially
expressed and that disparate patterns of immune responses, especially those felt to be reflective
of innate and adaptive cellular (mostly Th17) immunity were evident. Of particular note, rela￾tively lower values at baseline of serum albumin (< 2.8 g/dL) in combination with relatively
lower levels of only 4 specific analytes, namely, IL-9, IL-17, PDGF-bb, and RANTES, were
highly predictive of early death, with positive predictive value [PPV] = 88%; negative predictive
value [NPV] = 97%, and accuracy = 96% [1]. These and other recent results indicated that
acute DILI is associated with varying, often robust immune responses and that relatively
higher levels of expression of cytokines associated with innate immune activation are associ￾ated with poor prognosis, whereas higher levels of expression of cytokines associated with
adaptive immune responses, like IL-17, portend good long-term prognosis with eventual
recovery. Left unanswered by our earlier work was whether profiles of immune analytes in
serum at onset might also be of value for distinguishing phenotypes or pathogenetic mecha￾nisms of acute liver injury and/or ALF across more diverse causes. Similarly, in a recent report
from the US Acute Liver Failure Study Group [ALF SG] that involved 39 subjects with idiosyn￾cratic DILI, 21 with acetaminophen [Apap]-induced ALF, and 10 with ALF ascribed to acute
viral hepatitis, increased levels of IL-17 were found in ~ 60% of subjects, regardless of etiology,
as were levels of IL-21, which also are produced by Th17 cells [5].
The goals of the present study were to assess levels of 27 immune analytes in larger numbers
of subjects enrolled in two national registry consortia, namely, those of the US Drug-Induced
Liver Injury Network [DILIN] and of the Acute Liver Failure Study Group [ALFSG]. We were
particularly interested to learn whether and to what extent the earlier findings from DILIN [1]
would be confirmed in a new and larger cohort of 127 subjects with acute liver injury ascribed
to drugs and chemicals, compared with a new cohort of 63 healthy controls. We also set out to
assess profiles in subjects with more severe acute liver injury, enrolled into the ALF registry,
with injuries ascribed to idiosyncratic DILI [not due to Apap], as well as to acute hepatitis B, to
autoimmune hepatitis, or to Apap.

(DILIN) is a prospective, collaborative study of drug-induced liver injury in the United States,
which was initiated in 2003 as a cooperative agreement funded by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH)[6];[7] Adults and children greater than 2 years of age with documented clinically
significant DILI as evidenced by any of the following criteria were included in the DILIN pro￾spective study: (1) jaundice or serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL, and any elevations in ALT, AST,
or alkaline phosphatase, (2) no jaundice and serum bilirubin <2.5 mg/dL, but elevations in
ALT or AST (> 5 x ULN on at least two occasions, at least 24 hours apart) or elevations in alka￾line phosphatase (>2xULN on at least two similar occasions), (3) elevations in ALT or
AST > 5x baseline values or elevations in alkaline phosphatase > 2x baseline values in persons
with known pre-existing liver disease. Subjects were excluded for the following reasons: (1)
other known causes of acute liver injury, such as acute cholangitis, acute viral hepatitis, or
autoimmune liver disease, (2) Apap hepatotoxicity, (3) liver transplantation prior to the onset
of DILI, (4) failure to give informed consent, or (5) inability or unwillingness to comply with
case ascertainment procedures. Additional details are in Supplementary Material. Because our
goal here was to study subjects with truly acute liver injury of diverse causes, we limited sub￾jects to 127 who were enrolled within 14 days of the onset of symptoms and signs of DILI, and
who eventually were adjudicated to have experienced definite, highly likely, or probable DILI
[see below] and for whom adequate sera were available for analyses. These subjects were
enrolled in the DILIN registry between Sep 1, 2004 and Oct 13, 2016; none was included in the
previous paper [1]. Selected clinical, demographic, laboratory, and imaging data were collected
at study entry, and blood samples were drawn, processed, and sera frozen at -80˚C and sent on
dry ice to the NIDDK sample repository, where they were stored until retrieved for analyses.
We tried to restudy all subjects who recovered, after the acute DILI event at follow-up visits
with repeat blood draws at ~6 months after the acute episode. If there was evidence of ongoing
liver injury or abnormality at 6 months, we asked them to return again at 12 and 24 months
after enrollment.
After at least 6 months of follow-up information was available, cases were adjudicated for
the likelihood that the injury was due to the implicated drugs or HDS by a causality committee
of experienced hepatologists [8]. All cases were scored as being definite (1: �95% likelihood),
highly likely (2: 75–94%), probable (3: 50–74%), possible (4: 25–49%) or unlikely (5: <25%).
For cases with more than one implicated agent, each drug or HDS was scored separately in a
similar manner. For the purposes of this analysis, only cases scored as probable, highly likely
or definite were used. All cases were also graded for severity on a scale of 1 to 5 as mild, moder￾ate, moderate and hospitalized, severe or fatal using standardized criteria [9].
All deaths and liver transplants recorded in the DILIN Prospective study were assessed by a
committee of DILIN in a standardized manner, and the role of the drug- or HDS- induced
liver injury was scored as the primary cause, a contributory cause or not related [9].
Liver biopsies were not required as a part of the DILIN prospective protocol, but, if per￾formed in the course of routine medical care, requests were made that de-identified, recut,
unstained slides be prepared and sent to the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Insti￾tute, in the NIH Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD). All such biopsies were read by the DILIN
hepatic pathologist (D.E. Kleiner) without specific clinical information and scored for multiple
findings, previously described [10].
Subjects with acute liver failure
The Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) has studied prospectively more than 2,700
cases of ALF over 20 years (1998-present) as well as ~770 fitting the definition of acute liver
injury (ALI), defined as severe liver injury associated with INR � 2.0 with no hepatic

encephalopathy present. The criteria for ALF include INR �1.5 with any degree of hepatic
encephalopathy after an acute hepatic illness occurring less than 24 weeks after onset of the
acute disease. For all enrolled, ALFSG obtains clinical and demographic data; serum and DNA
samples are also obtained from most of these subjects. Subjects from ALFSG included in the
present study were those diagnosed as having acute idiosyncratic DILI (not due to Apap,
n = 39) [11], patients with ALF ascribed to Apap (n = 13), to auto-immune hepatitis [AIH]
(n = 38), to acute hepatitis B (n = 28). In the ALF study, informed consent was obtained from
next of kin because patients by definition had altered mentation. Subjects with ALF were fol￾lowed until the time of death or liver transplant or for up to 21 days after enrollment. Longer￾term follow-up was generally not available for these subjects.
Controls without evidence of any liver disease
De-identified subjects (n = 63) with no history of liver disease and normal hepatic function
profiles (serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin)
attending adult yearly well-patient follow-up clinic visits at Atrium Health (formerly Carolinas
Health Care System, Charlotte, NC) practices were identified, and serum samples were col￾lected, processed and stored, as described above.
Immune analyte profiling by bio-plex assay
Concentrations of immune analytes in sera were determined using a human 27-plex assay (14
cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN￾gamma, TNF-alpha); 7 chemokines (Eotaxin, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1-alpha, MIP-1beta,
RANTES); and 6 growth factors (IL-7, FGF basic, G-CSF, GM-CSF, PDGF-BB, VEGF)) (Bio￾Plex Suspension Array System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were diluted 1:4 (v:v) in sample diluent and incubated for 30 minutes at
room temperature, 300 rpm agitation with capture antibody-coupled magnetic beads. Follow￾ing three washes in a Bio-Plex Pro wash station, samples were incubated for 30 minutes in the
dark (room temperature, 300 rpm agitation) with biotinylated detection antibody. Each cap￾tured analyte was detected by the addition of streptavidin phycoerythrin and quantified using
a Bio-Plex array reader. Analyte concentrations were calculated with Bio-Plex Manager soft￾ware. Normal ranges for serum concentrations of immune analytes were based on measure￾ments obtained from the healthy controls and recorded as mean +/-1 standard deviation (SD).
Concentrations in sera of DILI or ALF subjects >1 SD higher or lower than the means of
healthy subjects were defined as abnormal.
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the cohorts. These include means and standard
deviations, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum for continuous data,
and counts with percentages for categorical data. For comparisons of continuous variables
between groups, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for two groups or the Kruskal-Wallis test for
more than two groups was employed. For comparisons of categorical data between groups, the
chi-square or Fisher’s exact test (for small sample) was employed. Sensitivity, specificity, posi￾tive and negative predictive value and accuracy were calculated when predicting acute death.
SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Inc, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses. A two-tailed p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The following modeling process was used to select variables among 27 immune analytes
and routine clinical lab test results [serum albumin, total bilirubin] for prediction of early
death [within 6 months of DILI onset] or early death/liver transplant for the DILIN data and

the ALF data separately. Because DILIN didn’t enroll any subjects due to Apap, we restrict
ALF data to those not due to Apap with n = 105 subjects in this process. To determine if the
previous published model [1] can be confirmed with the new DILIN data or the ALF data, the
same logistic regression models for predicting early death with the same variables were fitted
to estimate the corresponding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. In the event that the pub￾lished model did not work well with these new data, a modeling process with variable selection
was performed for the DILIN data and the ALF data, separately. Due to relatively small sam￾ples sizes for each etiology of acute liver disease and the relatively large number of variables
studied, our goal was to find a stable, robust model with the smallest number of independent
variables that are most predictive of prognosis. In the first step, we compared immune analytes
between those died vs those survived or those with early death/liver transplant vs. other to
select potential predictors. Those immune analytes that were statistically significant at
p � 0.05 level were considered in the second step in the stepwise logistic regression. If the
number of potential predictors is less than the number of events, then all these potential pre￾dictors were considered in the second step. If the number of potential predictors is larger than
the number of events, pairwise correlations between these predictors were examined. For
those pairs of variables with high correlation, only the predictor with smaller p-value in pre￾dicting death was retained in the second step. The linear combination of these variables in con￾tinuous scale may not be the best predictor for early poor outcome because the values of the
immune analytes can tend to be skewed. In the second step, all potential immune analytes
were dichotomized at their observed median values. The dichotomized immune analytes were
then used in the multivariate logistic regression with forward, backward and stepwise variable
selection process. Once the final set of variables had been selected, the area under curve (AUC)
was estimated for its potential prognostic and diagnostic value. A logistic regression model
with all of these variables was fit to estimate the AUC based on the fitted model with linear
combination of the binary variables as a predictor. Two summary binary variables, namely,
serum albumin (�2.8 g/dL or not, as used in our first publication [1]) and MELD score at
baseline (� 17 or not), were considered in the logistical modeling. The following four different
models were used for presentation: with serum albumin only, with MELD score only, with
selected binary immune analytes only, with a combined binary of serum albumin and immune
analytes. We expect that the binary variable, based on both immune analytes and clinical lab
data, to have the highest predictability for early poor outcome. This binary variable has a value
of 1 if values of the variables (immune analytes and clinical lab values) all fall in the binary cat￾egory that was predictive of early death based on direction of association, and a value of 0 oth￾erwise. The predictability of this binary variable for early poor outcome was evaluated by
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy (percent of cor￾rect prediction). Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.
Results
Subjects studied with liver injury
We studied 127 subjects with acute DILI enrolled into the US DILIN, all of whom were
enrolled within 14 days of the onset of symptoms and signs of DILI and all of whom were
assessed to have definite, highly likely, or probable acute DILI. None of these subjects had been
included in our previous publication [1]. The causative agents were many and varied, as sum￾marized in S3 Table. They were in keeping with results previously reported for the entire
DILIN cohort [7]; [12]. We also studied a total of 118 subjects with severe acute liver injury of
diverse etiologies, enrolled into the ALF SG registry of subjects. The causes of ALF in the latter
subjects were Apap in 13, drugs other than Apap in 39 [known causative agents summarized

in S4 Table], severe autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in 38, and severe viral hepatitis B in 28.
Selected demographic, laboratory, and outcome data on the subjects studied are summarized
in Table 1. As one might have anticipated, subjects with ALF due to Apap were younger and
more often women. Also striking is that African-Americans accounted for more than 35% of
cases of ALF due to all causes other than Apap (more than twice the percentage among the less
severe DILIN-acute cases (17.3%)), but accounted for none of the ALF-Apap cases. This trend
is consistent with another recent finding, namely, that the severity of DILI is greater in Afri￾can-Americans than in other racial groups [13].
As might have been anticipated, the levels of serum ALT and AST at study enrollment were
higher among subjects with ALF due to Apap, whereas levels of STBR in this cohort were
lower. Also striking were the lower platelet counts among subjects with ALF, regardless of eti￾ology, compared with those with less severe acute DILI. Regardless of etiology or severity,
median and mean values for absolute eosinophil counts were all less than 500/uL, emphasizing
that the subjects generally did not have evidence of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. In
addition, as one might expect, median values of MELD scores (32–35) [model of end-stage
liver disease] were significantly higher in those with ALF, regardless of etiology, than in those
with acute DILI of lesser severity (17). Nonetheless, 18 (14.2%) of acute DILI subjects had
died, among whom 2 had required liver transplants within 6 months of onset, and 5 additional
DILIN subjects had required liver transplants and had survived for at least 6 months. Overall,
23/127 (18.1%) of subjects with acute DILI died and/or underwent liver transplant within 6
months of DILI onset, similar to the percentages of ALF-drug non-Apap subjects who died or
received liver transplants within 6 months.
Levels of immune analytes in subjects studied are summarized in Fig 1
In this work, we have adhered to the general categorization of analytes that we used previously
[1]: “Innate cytokines” not requiring actions of T or B cells—IL-1b, IL-6, TNF alpha; “adaptive
cellular cytokines”—those that enhance/support T cell functions—IL-12p70, IFN gamma, IL￾2, IL-15, IL-17; “NFkB-dependent cytokines”—IL-8, MIP1a, MIP1b, MCP1; “cytokines
involved in resolving inflammation”—IL-1ra, IL-10; “other chemokines”—IP-10, RANTES,
eotaxin; and “growth factors”—IL-7, FGFb, GCSF, PDGFbb, and VEGF. As expected, values
of many of the analytes were higher among subjects with acute liver injury than among the
healthy controls, and values were often different among the several groups of subjects with
liver injury. However, despite numerous sub-group analyses and comparisons, we did not
unveil patterns of expression of immune analytes that were selective or specific for etiology of
acute liver injury, nor that were selective for any of the several drug causes of the liver injury.
Striking findings were as follows: 1. ALF-Apap subjects had very high levels of IL-6 and MCP￾1 and low levels of IL-9; 2. ALF subjects with other etiologies had low levels of IL-4, IL-13, IL￾17, RANTES, PDGF bb, and VEGF; 3. Acute DILI subjects had low levels of IL-2 and IL-15,
but no changes in IL-5, compared to healthy controls. We did not observe any significant cor￾relations of levels of serum analytes and gender, age, or ethnicity of subjects, nor, for those
ascribed to DILI, of the causative drugs. However, as regards the latter, it is important to keep
in mind that there were many and diverse drug causes, so that it would be unlikely that a single
drug cause would show significant difference from all others.
Analytes significantly correlated with severity of liver injury
In general, as we had observed before [1], subjects with more severe liver injury due to DILI
had lower values of immune analytes than those with less severe acute injury, albeit higher
than those of healthy controls. Levels of 20 immune analytes were significantly different in

scores 1–3). As described in our original work, plasma concentrations of 7/9 adaptive cyto￾kines measured in our study, growth factors such as PDGF-bb and the chemokine RANTES
were lower, whereas IL-6 was greatly elevated in the more severe group. In addition, as
expected, median MELD scores (24 vs 15, P <0.001) and INR values (1.7 vs 1.0, P < 0.001)
were higher in the more severely affected groups.

When we used MELD score at study entry as a marker of severity (MELD < 20 vs � 20),
among the subjects with acute DILI, we found a total of 7 immune analytes significantly differ￾ent with 5/7 being lower in subjects with MELD � 20, namely, IL-12, IL-17, PDGF-bb,

RANTES, and TNFa, whereas IL-6 and IL-8 were higher. In addition, as was anticipated, the
median level of serum albumin was lower in those with higher MELD scores (3.3 vs 3.7 g/dL,
p = 0.009), whereas INR was higher (1.7 vs 1.1, p< 0.001).
In the acute DILI cohort, only three analytes were significantly associated with elevations of
serum total bilirubin (STBR > 1.2 mg/dL, n = 105), namely, IL-8 (43 vs 28, P <0.001); MIP-1b
(224 vs 169, p = 0.007); and TNFa (39 vs 49, p = 0.020). If the critical value of STBR is chosen
as > 2.5 mg/dL vs � 2.5 mg/dL, only levels of IL-8, IP-10, and MIP-1b were all significantly
higher. If one chooses the critical value of STBR > 6 mg/dL, only levels of IL-8 and MIP-1b
continue to show significantly higher values.
Predictors of prognosis/outcomes
Among subjects from the DILIN cohort, immune analytes that, at baseline were significantly
different and correlated with death at 6 months were IL-6 (41 vs 10, p <0.001); IL-8 (60 vs 38,
p = 0.002); IL-17 (53 vs 88, p = 0.003), FGFb (56 vs 76, p = 0.03); and RANTES (6,441 vs
11,493, p< 0.001). Note that serum albumin also was significantly lower in those who died (2.6
vs 3.6 g/dL, p < 0001). As expected, the median MELD score among those who died
(MELD = 31) was significantly higher than the median MELD score (MELD = 17) of those
who survived. Similar patterns were observed for early outcome of death or liver transplant for
subjects with acute DILI from the DILIN, levels of 3 immune analytes (IL-17, RANTES, FGF￾basic) and albumin were significantly lower in those who died (n = 18) vs those who survived
at least 6 months (n = 109) and, in keeping with our earlier observations [1], IL-6 and IL-8
were elevated (Table 2).
Among subjects with ALF, if we include all known etiologies (ALF-Apap, ALF-drugs other
than Apap, ALF-AIH, and ALF-acute hepatitis B), there were a total of 16 subjects who died
within 6 months and 29 subjects who died or had liver transplants. Only IL-6 and IL-12 were
significantly different (p < 0.05), with IL-6 being significantly lower in those who died
(median = 36 vs 71), whereas IL-12 was significantly higher in those who died (median = 23 vs
11, p = 0.042). In addition, there were trends towards differences (p < 0.10) for IL-17, FGF￾basic, RANTES, and VEGF, with median values for all higher in those who died. Rather sur￾prisingly baseline levels of serum albumin were not different among these cohorts between
those who died vs those who survived, and MELD scores were significantly lower in those who

died (median 29 vs 35, p = 0.001). Because subjects with ALF due to Apap are rather different
from the other cohorts (Table 1) and because Apap overdose is the prototypical intrinsic, pre￾dictable, dose-dependent hepatotoxic drug, not dependent in pathogenesis upon the host
immune response to injury, we thought it best to exclude the ALF-Apap subjects from further
analyses.
Several immune analytes were different when we compared the subjects with acute DILI to
those from subjects with ALF (Table 3).
When we combined the acute DILIN subjects and the ALF subjects due to drugs other than
Apap, to AIH, and to acute hepatitis B, we found that a total of 32 died within 6 months and 49
died or had liver transplant within 6 months. Similar to our results for the acute DILIN sub￾jects alone (Table 2), the analytes that were significantly different between those who died vs.
survived in these combined cohorts were serum albumin, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES (Table 4).
The median MELD score was also significantly higher in those who died or required liver
transplantation than in those who survived (30 vs 24, p = 0.023). Similar analytes were noted
in comparison between died or liver transplanted vs all other.
However, when ALF subjects (due to drugs other than Apap, to AIH, and to acute hepatitis
B) were examined separately, there were a total of 14 died who within 6 months and 26 who
died or had liver transplant. In them, we found different analytes than in DILIN subjects that
were significantly or marginally significantly different between those died vs survived or
between those died or required liver transplants vs others. These analytes for died vs survived

were IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15, FBF basic. Therefore, modeling for predicting early
death or early death or liver transplant was carried out separately for the DILIN cohort and
ALF cohort.
Best models for predicting survival vs death at 6 months
For DILIN subjects, we were not able to fit the previous model [1] because there were no sub￾jects with serum albumin �2.8 g/dL and the four immune analytes below the specified values.
This may be due to different subjects and/or batches of reagents that we used for assessing rela￾tive levels of immune analytes than those of our prior work. Our modeling process in the 127
DILIN subjects studied here showed that the only independent immune analyte is binary
RANTES with cutoff at observed median of 11,349 pg/mL where, as before [1], lower RANTES
is associated with death within 6 months. Table 5 presents the modeling results from four dif￾ferent logistical models with serum albumin alone, MELD score alone, selected binary
RANTES alone, and combined binary variable of RANTES and serum albumin. The only inde￾pendent and significant predictors of death within 6 months of DILI onset were serum albu￾min �2.8 g/dL and RANTES, elevated above those of normal controls, but relatively lower
values, less than the median value (Table 5). The results are thus similar to the main results of
our first paper [1], although that model used serum albumin and four immune analytes (IL-9,
IL-17, PDGFbb, and RANTES), all of which were relatively lower in those who died than in
those who survived. In the current acute DILIN subjects, lower serum albumin, � 2.8 g/dL, is
very nearly as good a predictor as the combination of lower serum albumin + lower RANTES,
with overall accuracy 82% [95% CI 75–89%] vs 83% [95% CI 77–90%]. Both are notably supe￾rior to MELD score (less vs greater than its median value of 17), which had overall accuracy of
only 64% (95% CI = 55–72%) (Table 5). The models for outcomes of either early death or liver
transplant have similar overall accuracies.
For all ALF subjects excluding ALF-Apap, the accuracy of serum albumin � 2.8 g/dL in
predicting eventual outcomes was appreciably lower, only 35%. Despite the weaker perfor￾mance of this combination in the ALF subjects, they were notably better than MELD scores, in
that the median MELD score was significantly lower in those who died than in those who sur￾vived within 6 months (29 vs 35, p = 0.001). For the best model for predicting acute death for
subjects from the ALF Study, a combination of serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL and IL-13 greater
than the median value of 2.73 pg/mL provided an accuracy of 73% [Table 6]. In this cohort, if

the model in Table 5 is used with the observed RANTES median value of 5,699 pg/dl and
serum albumin less than or equal to 2.8 g/dL + RANTES greater than the median, the accuracy
in predicting outcome at 22 days was not as good at 66%. The models for predicting acute
death or liver transplant in the ALF subjects excluding ALF-Apap were somewhat different
(Table 7) where IL-5 rather than IL-13 was selected in the final model although the accuracies
were similar as the models for predicting acute death.
When we combined subjects with acute DILI from the US DILIN cohort and those with
ALF due to drugs other than Apap, to AIH, or to acute hepatitis B [which groups are biologi￾cally and patho-physiologically more similar to the acute DILIN subjects], we found a total of
three analytes that were significantly different between those who died vs those who lived,
namely, serum albumin, IL-6 and IL-8, and one analyte that showed a strong trend towards
significance, namely, RANTES (p = 0.056). The median MELD score of 30 [range 14–40] also
was significantly higher in those who died than in those who survived (MELD = 24, [range
6–40], p = 0.023).
Discussion
In this work, we report results of profiles of immune analytes in relatively large and diverse
cohorts of subjects with acute liver injury due to DILI as well as to several other causes of acute
liver failure. Our main findings are that levels of immune analytes are often changed in acute
liver injury/ALF, compared with controls without liver disease. Despite our performing many
statistical comparisons, we were not able to identify any unique or distinctive patterns of
abnormalities that were predictive of or significantly or uniquely correlated with etiologies of

ALF, nor with differing patterns of acute DILI–hepatocellular, vs cholestatic, vs mixed. We
also were unable to find any patterns that were unique or selective for specific drug causes of
acute DILI. However, because of the large number of incriminated drugs, each represented by
only one or a few examples, we had little statistical power to unveil such patterns. We had
hoped that profiles of immune analytes might help to improve further the reliability of
RUCAM or DILIN methods for assessing causality in drug-induced or other forms of liver
injury [14].
Most cytokine levels also were not correlated meaningfully with severity or outcomes of
acute DILI or other etiologies of ALF. However, as in our earlier report [1], we again found
that lower levels of serum albumin (< 2.8 g/dL, the critical value that defines Child-Turcotte￾Pugh class C chronic liver disease) and RANTES (< median value of all samples run in the
batch assay) at baseline were significantly predictive of those who were less likely to survive for
at least 6 months (in subjects with acute DILI without acute liver failure).
As regards profiles of immune analytes in subjects with Apap DILI, we found high levels of
IL-6 and MCP-1, whereas levels of IL-9 were low. Our assay platform, unfortunately, did not
include IL-18, which recently has been singled out as important in Apap DILI in a murine
model [15]. However, in our study, levels of IFN gamma in Apap DILI were not notably
increased (Fig 1). This latter finding is not in keeping with recent results from the murine
model of Apap DILI, in which prominent roles of IL-18 and one of its down-stream effectors,
IFN gamma, were proposed [15]. Others showed that Apap decreased the mRNA expression
of IL-1beta, IL-18, and the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in piglets [16].
The search for newer biomarkers, or groups of biomarkers that, at baseline, predict occur￾rence and eventual outcomes of acute liver injury thus continues. Additional recent candidate
biomarkers include microRNA-122 (miR-122), glutamate dehydrogenase, total keratin 18, cas￾pase-cleaved keratin 18, glutathione S-transferase alpha, alpha fetoprotein, arginase-1, osteo￾pontin, sorbitol dehydrogenase, liver fatty acid binding protein, cadherin-5, macrophage
colony stimulating factor receptor, paraoxonase 1 (normalized to prothrombin protein), and
leucocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 [17]. In this recent work, glutamate dehydrogenase corre￾lated more closely with serum ALT; levels of miR-122 were widely variable, both within and
among subjects. The most useful analytes predictive of death within 6 months of onset were
serum keratin 18, osteopontin, and macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.
The extent to which miR-122 or other miRNA levels may improve our predictive algo￾rithms remains to be ascertained and will be the subject of a later paper in this series.
Our models for predicting outcomes of acute DILI or ALF that included only levels of
serum albumin and selected cytokines performed appreciably better overall than the MELD
score (Table 5A, 5B and 5C). Perhaps, routine measurements of RANTES and IL-13, in addi￾tion to levels of serum albumin, will prove to provide a better model of prognosis of acute liver
injury. Measurements of serum albumin are readily and widely available, whereas those of
RANTES, IL-13, or other immune analytes are not. These would likely require quantification
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, which are more costly and involved than assays of
albumin or the components used for calculation of MELD. However, the MELD score is now
well accepted and widely available, so that additional confirmatory work with larger numbers
of subjects would be required.
Undoubtedly, numerous factors influence levels of immune analytes in the serum, particu￾larly in subjects with acute DILI or acute liver injury due to other causes. These may include
other underlying diseases, acute sepsis or other illnesses, for which drugs have been given, as
well as genetic or acquired host-specific factors (gender, age, ethnicity, etc.).
A finding in both our first paper [1] and in this new work is that levels of RANTES are
lower in subjects with acute idiosyncratic DILI who are destined to have poor outcomes.

RANTES (also known as C Chemokine Ligand-5, CCL5) is an integral component of liver
inflammation and repair pathways. It is up-regulated in livers of patients with hepatitis C or
alcoholic liver diseases and mediates in part the pathogenesis of experimental models of non￾alcohol-induced liver steatosis or fibrosis [18]. RANTES is produced by the reticuloendothelial
system of damaged liver tissue [19] and promotes chemo-attraction of myeloid cells and acti￾vation of Kupffer cells. While recruitment of inflammatory macrophages may contribute to
liver injury [20], hepatic macrophages are a highly dynamic and complex network sensing
altered tissue integrity and contributing in a major way to the maintenance of tissue homeosta￾sis [21]. Kupffer cells, for instance, contribute T cell tolerance by, inter alia, expressing
immune checkpoint agonist PD-L1, secreting prostaglandin PGE2 and indoleamine-2,3-diox￾ygenase. Recruitment of monocytes to the liver in case of injury is also an important prerequi￾site for liver regeneration and repair, as they help to clean up and to resolve liver injury and
necrosis, and they also cross-talk with hepatic pericytes [22, 23]. Thus, we speculate that lower
levels of RANTES foreshadow rather less robust macrophage functions and responses to acute
DILI and portend poorer outcomes.
The current study has strengths that include sizable numbers of subjects, especially subjects
from US DILIN. These subjects have been phenotyped in detail and have been followed for at
least 6 months—or until they died or underwent LT. Alternative causes of acute liver injury
were sought and reasonably ruled-out, and causality assessments were performed by a formal
method, previously studied and found to be more reliable than simply RUCAM [14]. Subjects
from ALF SG also were carefully characterized in a formal way, although, regrettably, due to
limitations of resources, follow-up was generally followed for longer than 22 days (or until
early death or LT). Nevertheless, we have performed analyte and data analyses on samples
from the largest numbers of alternative diagnoses to acute idiosyncratic DILI, such as acute
hepatitis B, AIH, as well as DILI due to Apap thus far assembled.
Limitations of this study include the following: Because of the characteristics of the reagents
and methods for assessing relative levels of immune analytes, we are unable to combine the
raw results of our previously published work [1] with the newer results summarized herein.
Would we have obtained greater reproducibility and comparability between studies with
ELISA assays for selected analytes, such as IL-9, IL-17, or RANTES? We do not know. In addi￾tion, although our total number of subjects with acute DILI was relatively high, the diverse
drug causes (S3 Table, and S4 Table) led to too few subjects with DILI due to a single agent
(except for ALF-Apap) to be able to draw any conclusions about possible drug-specific alter￾ations in profiles.
Then, too, variability in severity and course of acute DILI/ALF in genetically diverse popu￾lations and insufficient numbers of non-European-Americans (African-Americans, Asians, or
Hispanics) limit statistical power of sub-group analyses. With regard to DILI in African-Amer￾icans, it is striking that African-Americans accounted for more than 35% of cases of ALF due
to all causes other than Apap (more than twice the percentage among the less severe DILIN￾acute cases (17.3%)), but accounted for none of the ALF-Apap cases. This trend is consistent
with another recent finding, namely, that the severity of DILI is greater in African-Americans
than in other racial groups [13], suggesting that additional genetic or environmental factors
important in modulating the severity of DILI still remain to be identified. These results also
emphasize the importance of continued and expanded enrollment of persons of African
descent into the US DILIN, the ALF SG, and other registries around the world.
Another limitation is that, although subjects from both DILIN and ALF SG were enrolled
soon after the onset of liver injury (within 14 days), there was still some variability in the tim￾ing of obtaining the blood samples. In addition, due to the limitations of study designs, we did
not have repeated samples obtained and measured during the acute phase of injury. However,
Cytokine profiles in acute liver injury

in our earlier study [1], we did not find any significant differences in levels of immune analytes
whether samples were collected between 1–14 days or 15–30 days of onset of injury. To
address some of these limitations, in the ongoing US DILIN study, we are collecting repeated
samples during the acute phase of injury in new cohorts of subjects.
