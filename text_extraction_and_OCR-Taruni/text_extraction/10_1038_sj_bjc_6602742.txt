We previously reported the beneficial effects of combination therapy of interferon (IFN)-a/5-fluorouracil (FU) for advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumour thrombi in the major portal branches. This report describes the results of longer
follow-up and includes more than double the number of patients relative to the original report, and evaluates the role of IFN-a/type 2
interferon receptor (IFNAR2) expression on the response to the combination therapy. The study subjects were 55 patients with
advanced HCC and tumour thrombi in the major branches of the portal vein (Vp3 or 4). They were treated with at least two courses
of IFN-a/5-FU without major complication. In the 55 patients, 24 (43.6%) showed objective response (eight (14.5%) showed
complete response, 16 (29.1%) partial response), four (7.3%) showed no response, and 27 (49.1%) showed progressive disease.
Immunohistochemically, IFNAR2 expression was detected in nine out of 13 (69.2%) patients. There was significant difference in the
time-to-progression survival (P ¼ 0.0002) and the overall survival (Po0.0001) between IFNAR2-positive and -negative cases. There
was a significant correlation between IFNAR2 expression and response to IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy in univariate analysis
(P ¼ 0.0070). IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy is a promising modality for advanced HCC with tumour thrombi in the major portal
branches and could significantly depend on IFNAR2 expression.

The prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) remains poor, particularly in patients with tumour thrombi
in the major branches of the portal vein (Vp3 or Vp4) (Chen
et al, 1994; Yen et al, 1995; Tanaka et al, 1996; Ando et al, 1997;
Furuse et al, 1997; Lee et al, 1997; CLIP investigators, 1998;
Asahara et al, 1999; Yamakado et al, 1999). Almost all patients with
unresectable tumours die within several months and have poor
quality of life (QOL) due to intractable ascites or oesophageal
bleeding. Even in patients with resectable HCC, the prognosis
is extremely poor despite aggressive surgery (Tanaka et al,
1996; Asahara et al, 1999). In such a situation, conventional
therapies like percutaneous ethanol injection, microwave coagula￾tion therapy, and transcatheter arterial embolisation generally
have no clinical effect on HCC with portal tumour thrombi due
to poor efficacy and possible complications (Chen et al, 1994;
Yen et al, 1995; Furuse et al, 1997). Furthermore, arterial infusion
chemotherapy has also been attempted, but its effectiveness is
still unsatisfactory (Doci et al, 1988; Ando et al, 1997). Therefore,
a new strategy is required for these patients with intractable
HCC and tumour thrombi in the major branch of the portal
vein.
Several recent studies have indicated the beneficial effects of
interferon (IFN)-a-based combination therapies for hepatomas.
Patt et al (1993) reported 31% response rate in patients with
unresectable advanced hepatoma and low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
levels. Using intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy and systemic
IFN-a, Urabe et al (1998) reported a response rate of 47% in
patients with Vp3. In another study, Leung et al (1999) used
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and IFN-a and reported that this treatment
converted nine patients of 36 patients with inoperable HCC to
become suitable for tumour resection, and none developed
postoperative recurrence. More recently, Chung et al (2000)
reported partial response in 33% (six out of 18) of their patients
with major portal vein thrombosis or distant metastases, who
received systemic combination therapy with IFN-a and cisplatin
(CDDP). Based on this background, we experienced a patient with
advanced HCC and lung metastasis, who was successfully treated
with a combination therapy of IFN-a and tegafur/uracil (UFT)

(Miyamoto et al, 2000). In addition, we recently reported the
outstanding effects of intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) com￾bined with subcutaneous IFN-a for advanced HCC with tumour
thrombi in the major portal branches, since 1997 (Sakon et al,
2002). Based on our results, the marked effects and acceptable
toxicity of our therapy in HCC patients with extremely poor
prognosis suggest that IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy is a
promising treatment regimen.
However, the response rate in the above studies was not
absolute; to advance the effect of IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy
and to increase the response rate, it is necessary to investigate the
mechanism and to predict the response to IFN-a/5-FU combina￾tion therapy, for patients with advanced HCC. Interferon-a
suppresses the proliferation of all type I interferon receptor 2
(IFNAR2)-positive cancer cell lines in vitro through mechanisms
related to apoptosis or inhibition of cell cycle. Furthermore, the
antineoplastic effects of IFN-a may be mediated through its
high-affinity membrane type I receptor, IFNAR2. Thus, IFNAR2
expression in HCC tissues may be a useful predictor of the
response to IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy.
The present study is an extension to our previous work (Sakon
et al, 2002), in which we examined the clinical effects of the
combination therapy of subcutaneous IFN-a and arterial infusion
of 5-FU in 55 patients with HCC associated with Vp3 and
investigated whether the response to such therapy is influenced by
the expression level of IFNAR2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and selection criteria
This was a single arm open label study, based on our pervious
report (Sakon et al, 2002). Between December 1997 and December
2003, 124 patients with advanced HCC and tumour thrombi in the
major branches of the portal vein and multiple liver metastasis
(Vp3 or 4, IM3) were diagnosed in our department. Among these
patients, 10 were excluded because of liver failure, 44 underwent
hepatectomy before IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy because
they were within the indications for operation, 15 received other
treatments, seven had distant metastases, four were over 75 years
of age, and four patients refused to sign the informed consent form
because of fear of adverse effects. The remaining 55 patients were
enrolled in the study. All patients were radiologically confirmed
to have tumour thrombi in the major branches of the portal
vein (Vp3 or 4), and multiple intrahepatic metastases (IM3). The
diagnosis was based on liver function tests, serum alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP), serum protein induced by vitamin K absence
or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) and imaging techniques including
computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), hepatic angiography and arterial portography. The final
diagnosis was unresectable HCC in 55 patients mainly because of
marked portal tumour thrombi extending into all the three major
branches and/or poor liver function. Among the 55 patients, 13
signed informed consent documents approved by the institutional
review board attesting to the fact that they were aware of the
investigative nature of the study. Therefore, liver biopsy could be
performed in these 13 patients. On the other hand, the remaining
42 patients did not sign informed consent documents because of
fear of tumour implantation and/or bleeding accompanying liver
biopsy.
The following were the eligibility criteria for selection for intra￾arterial combination therapy; (1) age of more than 20 years and
less than 75 years, (2) tumour thrombi invading at least one of
the main branches of the portal vein, (3) presence of multiple
intrahepatic metastases in more than three segments (IM3), (4)
absence of extrahepatic metastases, (5) a granulocyte count of
more than 2500 ml
1 and less than 12 000 ml
1
, (6) a red blood cell
count of more than 8.0 g dl1
, (7) a platelet count exceeding
8  104 ml
1
, (8) GOT and GPT of less than 100 IU l1
. (9) total
bilirubin less than 1.4 g dl1
, (10) serum BUN less than 30 mg dl1
,
(11) serum creatinine less than 1.5 mg dl1
, (12) successful
implantation of intra-arterial catheter and drug delivery system,
and (13) a performance status of level 0 –2 (Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group, ECOG). These eligibility criteria were based
on our previous report (Sakon et al, 2002). All patients signed
informed consent documents approved by the institutional review
board attesting to the fact that they were aware of the
investigational nature of the study and were willing to try the
combination therapy.
Treatment protocol
In each of our 55 patients, an intra-arterial catheter was inserted
through the subclavian or femoral artery with a subcutaneously
implanted drug delivery system (Toyoda et al, 1995). Each patient
was treated with subcutaneous IFN-a (OIF, Otsuka Pharmaceutical
Co., Tokushima, Japan) and intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU (Kyowa
Hakko Co., Tokyo). Interferon-a (5  106 U (5 MU)) was
administered on days 1, 3, and 5 of each week. Continuous
infusion chemotherapy (5-FU, 300 mg m2 day1
) through the
proper hepatic artery was performed every 2 weeks for two
sessions via a catheter connected to a subcutaneously implanted
drug delivery system. In summary, 55 patients received this
therapy for multiple HCCs with tumour thrombi in the main
branch of the portal vein. There was no dose escalation, because
none of the six patients, in whom the adverse effects reached
level 2 of the ECOG classification, were there (with the exception
of platelet and leukocyte counts of o0.4  105 ml
1 and 2000 ml
1
,
respectively, before treatment because of cirrhosis).
Evaluation of response to anticancer therapy
In addition to serum chemistry, tumour markers such as AFP and
PIVKA-II were measured at least once every 4 weeks. Abdominal
CT scan or dynamic MRI was also performed before and after
treatment, and once every 3 months thereafter. We evaluated the
effects of therapy at 3 months after the commencement of this
therapy. Simon’s two-stage design (WHO handbook, 1979) was
used to calculate the sample size for clinical response evaluation.
The objective response was classified according to the ECOG
criteria (Oken et al, 1982). Complete response (CR) was defined as
the normalisation of tumour markers and the disappearance of all
tumours and portal vein thrombosis on CT and/or MRI. Partial
response (PR) represented a decrease of tumour markers and 50 –
99% regression on the two-dimensional measurement. No change
(NC) represented less than 50% regression or less than 25%
progression. Progressive disease (PD) represented more than 25%
progression. This classification was based on the World Health
Organization (WHO) handbook (WHO handbook, 1979).
Reagents
Rabbit polyclonal anti-human IFNAR2 antibody (OCT4813,
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokushima) and its blocking peptide
were prepared according to the report by Novick et al (1994).
Immunohistochemistry
The expression of IFNAR2 was examined in 13 tumour samples
of 55 cases by immunohistochemistry (Figures 3, 4 and 5, Table 3).
Biopsy samples were obtained with a needle guide/cover kit and
a 16-gauge core tissue biopsy needle (Bard MAGNUM: C.R. Bard
Inc., Covington, USA) under colour Doppler ultrasonography.
Immunohistochemistry was carried out according to the method
described previously by our laboratories (Kondo et al, 2000).
Tissue sections (4-mm thick) were deparaffinised in xylene and

heat antigen retrieval was performed as described previously
(Ciaparrone et al, 1998). The slides were then processed for
immunohistochemistry on the TeckMate Horizon automated
staining system (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA), using the
EnVision þ peroxidase kit (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). In the
step of primary antibody reaction, the slides were incubated
with the IFNAR2 antibody (final concentration: 2.5 mg ml1
) for
1 h at room temperature. For negative controls, nonimmunised
rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or TBS
(Tris-buffered saline) was used as a substitute for the primary
antibody to verify the possibility of false positive responses from
nonspecific binding of IgG or from the secondary antibody. In
addition, absorption tests were performed on tissue sections. The
intensity of IFNAR2 was scored in a scale from 0 to 2. IFN-a/type 2
interferon receptor expression was often heterogeneous. The
histological or immunohistological type that constituted the major
volume of the tumour was selected as the representative type.
Staining was repeated at least twice to avoid possible technical
errors but basically identical results were obtained. All slides were
interpreted by one of two investigators (HO or MK) in a blinded
manner without knowledge of the clinical and pathological
parameters. When the initial diagnosis was different, the final
diagnosis was mutually determined using a multihead microscope
by two investigators (HO or MK and KW).
Statistical analysis
The Breslow –Gehan –Wilcoxon univariate test was used to
examine the possible relationship between the effect of therapy
(CR, PR vs NC, PD), Child –Pugh score, serum AFP, serum PIVKA￾II, Okuda score, CLIP score (CLIP investigators, 1998) and the
expression of IFNAR2. Survival curves were constructed using the
Kaplan –Meier method. Differences in distribution between groups
were compared by the w2 test and differences in mean values by the
Student’s t-test. All data were expressed as mean7s.e.m. A P-value
less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant
difference.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between 1997 and 2003, 55 patients who had HCC with tumour
thrombi in the major branches of portal vein were enrolled in this
study. The clinical characteristics of the study participants are
summarized in Table 1. The median age of patients was 58.2 years.
In total, 24 patients were positive for HBV (anti-HBs antigen),
while 29 were positive for HCV (anti-HCV antibody) and five
patients were negative for both HBV and HCV. The mean
granulocyte count was 5310 ml
1
, the mean platelet count was
15.3  104 ml
1
. Almost all cases were Child A or B. Alpha￾fetoprotein and/or PIVKA-II were abnormal in 52 of 55 cases. The
median tumour size was 6.4 cm.
Clinical response to combination therapy
In this study, 55 patients with unresectable HCCs completed at
least two cycles of IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy, with a mean
number of treatment cycles of 3.6 cycles (range, 2 –12 cycles). With
respect to time-to-progression, the median progression-free
survival period was 5.2 months and the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year
progression-free survival rates were 11.3, 3.8, 3.8, and 1.9%,
respectively. Furthermore, the median overall survival period was
11.8 months and the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 48.9,
28.8, 16.4, and 16.4%, respectively. Of the 55 patients, 24 (43.6%)
showed objective response, eight (14.5%) showed CR, 16 (29.1%)
showed PR, four (7.3%) showed NC, 27 (49.1%) showed PD. The
median progression-free survival periods of CR/PR cases (n ¼ 24)
was 12.0 months and that of NC/PD cases (n ¼ 31) was 2.2 months.
The 1-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival rates of CR/PR
cases were 49.3, 20.6, and 20.6%, respectively, and those of NC/PD
cases were 0, 0, and 0%, respectively. The median survival periods
of CR/PR cases (n ¼ 24) was 24.4 months and that of NC/PD cases
(n ¼ 31) was 5.4 months. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of
CR/PR cases were 82.9, 54.2, and 30.9%, respectively, and those
of NC/PD cases were 13.1, 0, and 0%, respectively. The time-to￾progression survival and overall survival curves are shown in
Figures 1 and 2. There were significant difference in the time-to￾progression survival and the overall survival between responders
(CR/PR) and nonresponders (NC/PD) (Po0.0001).
Adverse effects
None of the patients developed side effects related to catheter
insertion or subcutaneous implantation of the drug delivery

system. However, 14.6% of patients developed grade 3 leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, or anaemia, but drip transfusion of granulocyte
colony-stimulating factors was not used during this study.
Nonhaematological toxicities included grade 1 or 2 fever (100%
of patients), chilling sense (100%), flu-like syndrome (100%),
generalised fatigue (25.4%), nausea (5.5%), diarrhoea (3.6%),
gastric ulceration (1.8%), skin reaction (5.5%), and depression
(3.6%). The side effects are summarised in Table 2.
Correlation between IFNAR2 immunostaining pattern and
prognosis
For each section, the intensity of IFNAR2 immunostaining was
scored on a scale from 0 to 2 where 0 represented no or faint
immunostaining (Figure 3A), 1: moderate (Figure 3B), and 2:
strong staining (Figure 3C). IFN-a/type 2 interferon receptor
expression was faint or undetectable in the vascular epithelium
whereas epithelial cells of the bile ducts generally expressed
moderate levels of IFNAR2 (Figure 3B, bottom). Accordingly, the
latter level of staining was used as an inner control within the
sample, which was designated arbitrarily as intensity level 1. IFN￾a/type 2 interferon receptor expression was noted in 69.2% (nine
out of 13) of cases. The median progression-free survival rate
was 12.6 months for IFNAR2-positive cases, 1.7 months for
IFNAR2-negative cases. The time-to-progression survival rates at
1, 2, and 3 years of IFNAR2-positive patients (n ¼ 9) were
significantly higher than the respective rates of IFNAR2-negative
patients (n ¼ 4) (P ¼ 0.0002, Figure 4A). The median overall
survival rate was 24.4 months for IFNAR2-positive cases, 3.4
months for IFNAR2-negative cases. The overall survival rates at 1,
2, and 3 years of IFNAR2-positive patients (n ¼ 9) (88.9, 55.6, and
22.2%, respectively) were significantly higher than the respective
rates (0, 0, and 0%) of IFNAR2-negative patients (n ¼ 4)
(Po0.0001 each, Figure 4B).
Clinical and pathological correlations
Finally, we compared the responders (CR/PR) (n ¼ 8) with the
nonresponders (NC/PD) (n ¼ 5) in terms of serum AFP (within
normal range; o5), serum PIVKA-II (normal range; o45), Child –
Pugh score, OKUDA score, CLIP score, and IFNAR2 expression by
univariate analysis (Table 3). Serum AFP, PIVKA-II, Child –Pugh
score, OKUDA score, and CLIP score did not correlate with the
response to combination therapy. On the other hand, IFNAR2
expression correlated significantly with the response to IFN-a/5FU
combination therapy (P ¼ 0.0070). Thus, the expression level of
IFNAR2 was the sole factor that influenced the response to the
combination therapy. The correlation between IFNAR2 expression
and response to therapy is shown in Figure 5.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed the beneficial effects of IFN-a/5-FU
combination therapy in patients with multiple lesions and tumour

second report on this treatment. The efficacy of such treatment
was 43.6% in our patients with highly advanced HCC, which was
almost similar to the previous report of patients with the same
stage HCC (Urabe et al, 1998). The prognosis of such patients is
extremely poor and survival is generally limited to a few months
after diagnosis, despite multimodal therapies even in cases suitable

survival rates were 30.5, 0, and 0%, respectively, for IFNAR2-positive cases,
0, 0, and 0%, respectively, for IFNAR2-negative cases. There was a
significant correlation between positive and negative cases (P ¼ 0.0002).
(B) The median overall survival rate was 24.4 months for IFNAR2-positive
cases and 3.4 months for IFNAR2-negative cases. The overall survival rates
at 1, 2, and 3 years of IFNAR2-positive patients (n ¼ 9) (88.9, 55.6 and
22.2%, respectively) were significantly higher than the rates (0, 0, and 0%,
respectively) of IFNAR2-negative patients (n ¼ 4). There was a significant
difference between positive and negative cases (Po0.0001).

for surgical resection (Poon et al, 2003). The combination
treatment of IFN-a and 5-FU markedly decreased tumour size
and levels of tumour markers with an encouraging response rate
and prolonged survival time in the responders. Furthermore, the
clinical response completely reflected the survival benefits, as
shown in Figures 1 and 2. On the other hand, almost all
nonresponders died within 6 months. No response to the
combination therapy was seen in 56.4% (31 out of 55) of our
patients in this study. To advance the effect of IFN-a/5-FU
combination therapy and to increase the response rate, it is
necessary to investigate the mechanism of IFN-a/5-FU combina￾tion therapy.
Several mechanisms for the anticancer effects of IFN-a, with or
without 5-FU, have been proposed. In general, both agents have
antitumour properties, even when used alone. These effects can be
direct and/or indirect (immunological) antitumour effects. The
direct antitumour effects include cell damage (Grander et al, 1993),
upregulation of cancer antigen (Guadagni et al, 1989), and delayed
action on the cell cycle (Kimchi, 1992). On the other hand, the
indirect antitumour actions include activation of natural killer cells
(Ortaldo et al, 1983), T cell system (Brinkmann et al, 1993), and
macrophages (Uno et al, 1985). It is also possible that both IFN-a
and 5-FU reinforce the antitumour action of each other or have
additive effects. In vitro experiments showed that IFN-a induces
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors involved in G1/G0 arrest
(Sangfelt et al, 1999). Interferon-a may also exert its antitumour
effect indirectly via the immune system since IFN-a is known to
augment T-cell cytotoxicity (Lindahl et al, 1972; Trinchieri et al,
1978). Recently, we reported that the modulation of tumour
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) recep￾tor-mediated cytotoxic pathway could partially contribute to the
anti-HCC effect of IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy (Yamamoto
et al, 2004). In addition, several experimental studies demon￾strated that IFN-a enhanced the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU in various
cultured malignant cells (Wadler and Schwartz, 1990; Schwartz
et al, 1992). The upregulation of 5-FU activities combined with
IFN-a was also shown by our laboratories (Damdinsuren et al,
2003).
Moreover, IFN-a suppressed the proliferation of all IFNAR2-
positive HCC cell lines in vitro through mechanisms related
to apoptosis or inhibition of cell cycle (Yano et al, 1999). The
importance of IFNAR2 expression for the anticancer effect of
IFN-a/5-FU was shown in such situation in our previous report
(Eguchi et al, 2000). These findings suggest that the antineoplastic
effects of IFN-a are likely to be mediated through its high-affinity
membrane type I receptor, IFNAR2 (Darnell et al, 1994). In this
regard, IFNAR2 expression in HCC tissues may be a useful
predictor of response to such therapy and thus distinguish
between responders and nonresponders to IFN-a/5-FU combina￾tion therapy.
We previously validated the suitability of IFNAR2 antibody
(OCT4813) used in the present study, by the agreement between
the results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis;
when expression of IFNAR2 protein was examined after cell
fractionation in a patient positive for IFNAR2, the long and short
forms of IFNAR2 were predominant in the cell membrane fraction
while the soluble form was observed only in the cytosol fraction
(Kondo et al, 2000). This result demonstrated that the immuno￾histochemically evident expression of IFNAR2 correlated with the
expression of the active form of IFNAR2 (Yatsuhashi et al, 1999).
The reliability of this antibody was also established in two other
reports (Takayama et al, 2000; Fujiwara et al, 2003). Based on these
results, we investigated the relationship between IFNAR2 expres￾sion and the effect of IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy using
immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed good correla￾tion between the effect of such therapy and expression level of
IFNAR2.
Several markers for prediction of tumour recurrence and
prognosis have been identified. Levy and Sherman (2002) reported
that the CLIP classification for HCC is easier to implement and
more accurate than the OKUDA classification. In addition, Koike
et al (2001) suggested that serum PIVKA-II level is the most useful
predisposing clinical parameter for the development of portal
vein invasion. To investigate the role of these clinical parameters,
AFP, PIVKA-II, OKUDA score, and CLIP score were used in
the present study to assess the clinical effects of IFN-a/5-FU
combination therapy. The results showed that the expression of
IFNAR2 was the only significant predictor of clinical outcome of
IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy; no significant correlation was
found with other factors, including serum AFP, serum PIVKA-II,
Child –Pugh score, Okuda Score, and CLIP score. Moreover,
survival analysis showed the significant role of IFNAR2 expression
on prognosis; IFNAR2-positive cases had better prognosis than
negative cases. These results suggest that the expression of IFNAR2
could be a potentially useful predictor of the response to IFN-a/5-
FU combination therapy. In our recent report using microarray
analysis, several genes concerned with IFN signalling transduction
were found useful for molecular prediction of response to IFN-a/5-
FU combination therapy in advanced HCC (Kurokawa et al, 2004).
Two issues should be discussed in relation to our results. First,
IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy had no effect in IFNAR2-
negative cases. Upregulation of IFNAR2 may be considered in
order to induce a better response to the therapy in such cases.
This proposition is based on the results of early studies, in addition
to those of the present study. For example, Wagner et al (2004)
showed that LOX, MDA231, MT1, and HT1080 cell lines
transfected with IFNAR2c demonstrated a marked increase in
their IFN-dependent antiproliferative response. Applying this
method to HCC cells, IFNAR1/2 transfection might lead to
overexpression of IFNAR2 and IFN-a-induced cell apoptosis.
One recent study involving in vitro experiments showed that
IFNAR2 gene transfer is effective in augmenting the biological
activity of IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy in human HCC
(Kondo et al, 2005). Thus, IFNAR2 gene transfection might
enhance the response to IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy in
IFNAR2-negative patients.
Second, not all IFNAR2-positive cases benefited from IFN-a/5-
FU combination therapy. In such patients, increasing the doses
or modifying the combination therapy (e.g. addition of other
antitumour agents) might increase the response rate. Other
parameters, apart from the expression of IFNAR2, might be
important and necessary for the response to IFN-a/5-FU

combination therapy. A recent report showed that transcription of
the p53 gene is induced by IFN-a, accompanied by an increase in
p53 protein level (Takaoka et al, 2003). The study suggested that
p53 gene might be an important predictor of IFN-a therapy for
HCV liver cirrhosis and HCC. In addition to IFNAR2 immuno￾histochemistry, p53 sequence analysis may identify other factors
that could predict the response to IFN-a/5-FU combination
therapy. In this regard, Yano et al (1999) used HCC cell lines
and showed that normal p53 gene expression is not necessary for
IFN-a-induced apoptosis. Thus, further studies are required to
determine the importance of p53 mutation on the response to
IFN-a/5-FU combination therapy.
In conclusion, we demonstrated the efficacy of IFN-a/5-FU
combination therapy for patients of advanced HCC with tumour
thrombi in major branches of the portal vein. We also showed that
the clinical response to such therapy correlated significantly with
the expression of IFNAR2 in HCC.
