ABSTRACT
Background
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinical complication of severe acute lung
injury (ALI) in humans, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. ALI
is characterized by disruption of the lung alveolar–capillary membrane barrier and resultant
pulmonary edema associated with a proteinaceous alveolar exudate. Current specific treatment
strategies for ALI/ARDS are lacking. We hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with
or without transfection with the vasculoprotective gene angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) would have
beneficial effects in experimental ALI in mice.
Methods and Findings
Syngeneic MSCs with or without transfection with plasmid containing the human ANGPT1
gene (pANGPT1) were delivered through the right jugular vein of mice 30 min after
intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce lung injury. Administration of
MSCs significantly reduced LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation, as reflected by reductions in
total cell and neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (53%, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 7%–101%; and 60%, CI 4%–116%, respectively) as well as reducing levels of
proinflammatory cytokines in both BAL fluid and lung parenchymal homogenates.
Furthermore, administration of MSCs transfected with pANGPT1 resulted in nearly complete
reversal of LPS-induced increases in lung permeability as assessed by reductions in IgM and
albumin levels in BAL (96%, CI 6%–185%; and 74%, CI 23%–126%, respectively). Fluorescently
tagged MSCs were detected in the lung tissues by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in
both naı¨ve and LPS-injured animals up to 3 d.
Conclusions
Treatment with MSCs alone significantly reduced LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflamma￾tion in mice, while administration of pANGPT1-transfected MSCs resulted in a further
improvement in both alveolar inflammation and permeability. These results suggest a potential
role for cell-based ANGPT1 gene therapy to treat clinical ALI/ARDS.

Introduction
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clin￾ically important complication of severe acute lung injury
(ALI) in humans, is a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality in critically ill patients [1–4]. Infectious etiologies,
such as sepsis and pneumonia, are leading causes of ALI/
ARDS [1,2]. Histologically, ALI/ARDS in humans is charac￾terized by a severe acute inflammatory response in the lungs
and neutrophilic alveolitis [1]. Inflammatory stimuli from
microbial pathogens, such as endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide
[LPS]), are well recognized for their ability to induce
pulmonary inflammation, and experimental administration
of LPS, both systemically and intratracheally, has been used
to induce pulmonary inflammation in animal models of ALI
[5–9].
The physiological hallmark of ARDS is disruption of the
alveolar–capillary membrane barrier (i.e., pulmonary vascu￾lar leak), leading to development of noncardiogenic pulmo￾nary edema, in which a proteinaceous exudate floods the
alveolar spaces, impairs gas exchange, and precipitates
respiratory failure [1,10,11]. Both alveolar epithelial and
endothelial cell (EC) injury and/or death have been impli￾cated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS [1]. However, despite
decades of research, few therapeutic strategies for clinical
ARDS have emerged, and current specific options for
treatment are limited [12–16]. ARDS continues to be an
important contributor to prolonged mechanical ventilation
in the intensive care unit, and ARDS-associated mortality
remains high at 30%–50% despite optimal supportive care
[1,13,14,16].
Marrow-derived stem or progenitor cells are being eval￾uated for the treatment of a number of diseases that currently
have limited or no treatment options [17–22]. Recent studies
have demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) [23,24] can engraft in the injured lung
[25,26] and even differentiate into lung epithelial cells in vivo
[25,27,28]. MSCs may also exhibit immunosuppressive prop￾erties and have been suggested to be ‘‘immune-privileged’’,
and thus are protected from rejection, potentially permitting
their use in allotransplantation [29–34]. Therefore, MSCs may
have beneficial effects in their own right in the therapy of ALI
[35].
Human angiopoeitin 1 (ANGPT1), a ligand for the
endothelial-restricted receptor TEK tyrosine kinase (TEK;
previously called TIE2) [36,37], plays an essential role in blood
vessel maturation and stabilization during embryonic devel￾opment. In the postnatal state, ANGPT1 maintains the
normal quiescent phenotype of vascular ECs, protecting
against vascular inflammation [38,39], reducing permeability
[40–42], and promoting EC survival [43–46]. Given its anti￾inflammatory, antipermeability, and endothelial-protective
characteristics, we hypothesized that ANGPT1 gene transfer
may be beneficial in the treatment of ALI.
The combination of cell and gene therapies has proven
successful in the treatment of experimental pulmonary
hypertension [47–51]. This dual strategy not only allows
direct targeting of the lung for clinical intervention, but also
provides a site-specific source to release therapeutic proteins
and/or other cellular products of interest by the retained
cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
effect of MSCs alone or in combination with the vasculopro￾tective factor ANGPT1 on lung inflammation and injury
induced by LPS in a murine model of ALI.
Materials and Methods
Characterization, Culture, and Transfection of MSCs
A frozen vial of murine MSCs (isolated from male C57Bl/6J
mice; courtesy of Tulane Center for Gene Therapy, New
Orleans, Louisiana, United States) was thawed and expanded
as previously described [52]. Differentiation of MSCs was
evaluated using a Mesenchymal Stem Cell Functional Identi￾fication Kit (R&D Systems, http://www.rndsystems.com/).
Chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation assays were
performed in six-well Primaria plates (BD Biosciences, http://
www.bdbiosciences.com/). The adipogenic assay was per￾formed in eight-well Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide System
(NUNC, http://www.nuncbrand.com/). MSCs were labeled with
anti-mouse antibodies Sca-1 (clone E13–161.7), CD31 (clone
MEC13.3), CD34 (clone RAM34), VCAM-1 (clone 429[MVCA￾M.A]), Flk1 (clone Avas 12a1), cKit (clone 2B8), CD45R (clone
RA3-6B2), and CD11b (clone M1/70) and corresponding
isotype controls purchased from BD Biosciences, and analyzed
by flow cytometer (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter, http://
www.beckmancoulter.com/). MSCs used in all in vivo experi￾ments were between passages 8 and 11. The full-length coding
sequence of ANGPT1 (1115 bp) was cloned into the expression
vector pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/)
as previously described [51]. MSCs were transfected by
nuclear-targeting electroporation (nucleofection, Amaxa,
http://www.amaxa.com/), SuperFect (activated dendrimer,
Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com/) or Lipofectamine (cationic
lipids, Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/). For the in vivo
study, nuclear-targeting electroporation was used to transfect
MSCs with ANGPT1 plasmid or empty vector plasmid. Human
ANGPT1 protein expression was verified by ELISA (R&D
Systems).
Murine Model of LPS-Induced ALI
All animal procedures were approved in advance by the
Animal Care Committee of St. Michael’s Hospital (Toronto,
Ontario, Canada). Carboxy-fluorescein diacetate, succinimid￾yl ester (Vybrant CFDA SE Cell Tracer Kit, Invitrogen) was
used to label cells before injection into the animals. Aliquots
of MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry to confirm
complete labeling. Female mice (19.9 6 1.3 g) were
anaesthetized and orally intubated with a sterile plastic
catheter, and challenged with intratracheal instillation of
800 lg of LPS (E. coli 055:B5; Sigma) dissolved in 50 ll of
normal saline. Saline, MSCs, MSCs transfected with pFLAG
(MSCs-pFLAG), or MSCs transfected by plasmid containing
human ANGPT1 (MSCs-pANGPT1) (2.5 3 105 cells, 100 ll
total volume) were slowly infused via a jugular venous canula
30 min following LPS challenge. Human ANGPT1 protein
expression was confirmed by ELISA for each batch of MSCs￾pANGPT1 employed. Naı¨ve mice (without LPS instillation)
were injected with saline or MSCs to serve as controls for any
inflammatory response that might result from the injected
MSCs. After infusion, the canula was withdrawn, the vein
ligated, and the incision sutured using silk suture. Mice were
humanely killed at 15 min or 3 d after MSC treatment to
collect tissues for analysis.
Due to the small size of the animals, two measurement

groups were required to collect all tissue samples required. In
one set of animals (n ¼ 5 per group), lungs were lavaged three
times with 1 ml of saline. Total cell counts were determined
using a haemocytometer. Differential cell counts were deter￾mined on BAL smear slides that were stained with Hemacolor
(EMD Chemicals, http://www.emdbiosciences.com/). Number
of neutrophils was calculated as the percentage of neutrophils
multiplied by the total number of cells in the BAL fluid sample.
BAL fluid collected was then centrifuged at 800 g, and
supernatant was collected for analysis of total protein,
albumin, IgM, and cytokine/chemokine levels. All analyses
were performed in a blinded fashion. The abdominal aorta and
vena cava were severed at the diaphragm, and the right
ventricle of the heart perfused with 10 ml of heparinized saline.
The left lower lobe of the lung was snap-frozen, and later
processed for lung homogenates. The rest of the lung was
digested with dispase II (3.6 U/ml; Roche, http://www.roche.
com/) into a single-cell suspension, according to a previously
published protocol [53]. In another set of animals (n ¼ 5 per
group, except for the LPS/saline group [n ¼ 9] and the LPS/
MSCs group [n ¼ 10]), blood was collected with a heparinized
needle through cardiac puncture, and later centrifuged at
2,000 g to obtain plasma sample. Lungs were divided into two
parts: the left lower lobe was collected as frozen tissue in OCT
(Optimal Cutting Temperature; SAKURA FINETEK, http://
www.sakura-americas.com/) and the rest was fixed by 4%
paraformaldehyde for histology.
Histopathology
Lung tissues (two cross sections of right lower lobe and one
of right upper lobe) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-lm thick sections.
Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and images
were taken with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a 403
objective. The average interalveolar septal thickness was
quantified in a blinded fashion by measuring the thickness of
all septae along a crosshair placed on each image (at least 150
septa per animal), using ImageJ software (National Institutes
of Health; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/). For the lung injury score,
images were evaluated by a investigator who was blinded to
the identity of the slides (WCL) following a previously
published scoring system [54].
Measurement of Albumin, IgM, Cytokines, and
Chemokines
Albumin and IgM levels in BAL fluid samples were
measured using with a murine-specific albumin ELISA kit
(ALPCO Diagnostics, http://www.alpco.com/) and a murine￾specific IgM ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, http://www.
bethyl.com/), respectively. Cytokine levels (IFN-c, TNF-a,
IL6, and IL1b) in BAL fluid were measured with murine
cytokine-specific Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Chemokine levels in BAL fluid, and cytokine/chemokine
levels in lung homogenates and plasma, were measured by
multiplex immunoassay (Luminex 100, Luminex, http://www.
luminexcorp.com/) using cytokine-specific bead kits (R&D
Systems). Lung homogenates were processed according to a
previously published protocol [55], and all results were
normalized (25 lg of total protein per sample) with individual
protein concentration measured from lung homogenate
samples by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, http://www.bio-rad.com/).
MSCs Rentention Study
Mouse lung was digested into single cells using dispase II
enzyme (3.6 U/ml, Roche) according to a previously published
protocol [53]. The number of total cells recovered was
determined by using a hemocytometer. Isolated cells were
analyzed by a flow cytometer (FC500, Beckman Coulter) with
a minimal collection of 30,000 events per sample. Cell nuclei
were counterstained with nuclear dye TO-PRO-3 (Invitro￾gen), and confocal microscopic images were collected with a
Leica TCS SL laser scanning confocal microscope.
Statistics
Data in figures are represented as individual data points in
a vertical dot plot, with a line to indicate the mean, except
data for surface marker expression on MSCs, and retention of
injected MSCs, in which data are represented as bar graphs
showing mean 6 standard error of the mean (SEM). Lung
injury score and septal thickness data are shown in tabular
form (mean 6 SEM). Differences between the treated groups
versus the injured group (LPS/saline) were assessed using a
one-way ANOVA (with post hoc comparisons using Dunnett
test) with statistic software (GraphPad Prism version 4.00;
http://www.graphpad.com/). A value of p , 0.05 was consid￾ered statistically significant.
Results
Characterization and ANGPT1 Transfection of MSCs
Murine MSCs were demonstrated to differentiate into
three predominant mesenchymal lineages: adipocytes, osteo￾cytes, and chondrocytes (Figure 1A–1D). The cells were
uniformly positive for the stem cell surface marker Sca1 by
flow cytometry (Figure 1E). Subpopulations of MSCs were
CD34þ and VCAM1þ, as previously reported for murine MSCs
from the C57Bl/6J background [52]. The cells were negative
for both CD11b (monocyte marker) and CD45R (leukocyte
marker).
Flow cytometric analysis of MSCs transfected by nuclear￾targeting electroporation resulted in ;55% greater GFP
expression in live cells compared to transfection with either
SuperFect or Lipofectamine (unpublished data). At 24 h after
nucleofection with pANGPT1, ANGPT1 protein (724 6 283
pg/ml) was detected in the culture supernatant (from 5 3 105
cells), and levels were sustained for more than 5 d (Figure S1;
detailed methods described in Protocol S1). Phosphorylation
of the TEK receptor, mediated by human ANGPT1 protein
expressed using the same plasmid, has been previously
validated by our group [51]. Nontransfected or null-trans￾fected (empty vector) MSCs produced no detectable ANGPT1
protein.
Effect of MSCs Alone or Transfected with ANGPT1 on
Acute LPS-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation
LPS was administered to mice followed by an injection of
saline, MSCs alone, or MSCs transfected with pFLAG (null) or
ANGPT1 plasmid (MSCs-pANGPT1) (Figure 1F). The total
inflammatory cell count in the BAL fluid was increased
approximately 20-fold at day 3 following administration of
LPS, mainly attributable to an increase in neutrophils
(around 80% of total cells in LPS/saline group). Treatment
of animals with MSCs alone significantly reduced the total cell
and neutrophil counts in BAL fluid (Figure 2A and 2B, p ,

0.05 compared to LPS/saline group). Treatment with MSCs￾pANGPT1 further reduced the BAL fluid cell count to a level
similar to control, naı¨ve mice (p , 0.01 for total cells and
neutrophils counts compared to LPS/saline group). Substitu￾tion of skin fibroblasts or unfractionated bone marrow cells
for MSCs did not prevent the observed LPS-induced increase
in BAL fluid cell counts (unpublished data).
Histological assessment of lung sections 3 d after the
administration of LPS revealed evidence of marked inflam￾matory infiltrates, interalveolar septal thickening, and inter￾stitial edema (Figure 2C). MSCs alone reduced airspace
inflammation, which was more apparent in mice treated with
MSCs-pANGPT1. Morphometric analysis measuring interal￾veolar septal thickness showed a modest increase in the LPS
alone group, with a significant reduction in animals receiving
MSCs (Table 1). Severity of lung injury was also scored using a
semiquantitative histopathology score system [54], which
evaluates lung injury in four categories: alveolar septae,
alveolar hemorrhage, intra-alveolar fibrin, and intra-alveolar
infiltrates. Although treatment with MSCs or MSCs￾pANGPT1 tended to reduce lung injury scores (Table 1),
the observed differences did not reach statistical significance.
To further evaluate the anti-inflammatory actions by MSCs
and MSCs-pANGPT1, levels of proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokines were measured in BAL fluid collected from
animals. Proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-c, TNF-a, IL6, and
IL1b) were all elevated in BAL fluid in response to LPS
challenge compared with naı¨ve animals receiving saline
(Figure 3). Treatment with MSCs alone variably decreased
the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, while treatment with

photomicrograph of MSCs-pANGPT1 was obtained using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted microscope with a 103 objective 1 d after transfection and
prior to injection into animals.

MSCs-ANGPT1 Treatment of ALI Mice

MSCs-pANGPT1 dramatically reduced cytokine levels to the
baseline values observed in naı¨ve mice. LPS instillation also
increased the levels of Cxcl2, JE (the murine homolog of
human CCL2), and KC (the murine homolog of human IL8) in
BAL fluid, whereas treatment with MSCs, and to a greater
extent MSCs-pANGPT1, attenuated these increases. Similarly,
LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine levels in whole lung
homogenates were significantly reduced by treatment with
MSCs or MSCs-pANGPT1 (Figure 4), however, in this case
MSCs alone did not differ significantly from MSCs-pANGPT1
in reducing proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels.
Discrepancies in BAL cytokine levels between animals that
received non- or null-transfected MSCs were occasionally
noted, likely reflecting biological variability, since mice

receiving null-transfected MSCs usually showed results
similar to those in mice that received nontransfected MSCs.
No detectable differences in cytokine and chemokine levels in
plasma were observed among different treatment groups 3 d
after treatment, suggesting that intratracheal LPS instillation
induced localized inflammation in the lungs, and did not
result in prolonged systemic inflammation in our model
(unpublished data).
Effect of MSCs and MSCs-pANGPT1 on LPS-Induced Lung
Permeability
Concentrations of total protein, albumin, and IgM were
assayed on collected BAL fluid to evaluate the integrity of the
alveolar–capillary membrane barrier and assess pulmonary
vascular leakage as a marker for ALI. These parameters of
vascular leak were markedly increased (total protein, 3-fold;
albumin, 4-fold; and IgM, 25-fold) in BAL fluid 3 d after LPS
instillation compared to naı¨ve mice. Whereas treatment with
MSCs alone partially reduced total protein, albumin, and IgM
levels (Figure 5), treatment with MSCs-pANGPT1 restored
these lung injury indicators to levels not different from naı¨ve
control mice (p , 0.01 for total proteins and albumin, and p
, 0.05 for IgM compared to LPS/saline group, respectively).
To assess apoptosis in LPS-induced ALI mice with or without
treatment, caspase 3 and 7 activities were measured in lung
homogenate samples. Activities of caspase 3 and 7 in mouse
lungs tended to be increased 3 d after animals received
intratracheal instillation of LPS, which was normalized only
in mice that received MSCs-pANGPT1 treatment (Figure S2;
detailed method described in Protocol S1).
Persistence of MSCs in Mice with or without LPS-Induced
ALI
Retention of MSCs in the lung after central venous
injection was verified by confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry. MSCs labeled with the green fluorescent cell
tracker CFDA SE [56] were observed in lung sections from
both naı¨ve and LPS-challenged mice sacrificed at 15 min
(initial retention, Figure 6A). Although labeled cells could still
be detected 3 d after injection, they were far less abundant
(Figure 6C). No cell-specific green fluorescence was observed
in sections from animals that did not receive CFDA SE￾labeled cells (unpublished figure). To confirm that the green
fluorescence observed was indeed from an intact cell, a z￾series using laser scanning confocal microscopy was per￾formed showing blue nuclear staining surrounded by green
fluorescence by CFDA SE labeling (Figure 6B). The percent￾age of the injected MSCs retained in the lungs was quantified
by flow cytometry following dispase lung digestion. An
average 47% of injected cells were found in the lungs shortly
after MSCs delivery in LPS-challenged mouse lungs compar￾ing to 38% in naı¨ve mice, though the difference was not
statistically significant. Regardless of lung injury, the majority
of MSCs were lost from the lung after 3 d, leaving less than
8% of cells remaining (Figure 6D).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate in a murine model of
ALI that administration of MSCs to the pulmonary circu￾lation partially prevented LPS-induced lung inflammation,
whereas treatment with pANGPT1-transfected MSCs resulted
in further improvement in both alveolar inflammation and
permeability. These findings have potentially important
implications for the treatment of ARDS, a clinical syndrome
resulting from ALI, which represents an important thera￾peutic problem contributing to high morbidity and mortality
of critically ill patients.
Cell-based gene transfer can overcome some of the
limitations of direct gene therapy for pulmonary diseases
[57], achieving selective and durable transgene expression in
the lung [48–51,58]. Since stem and progenitor cells have also
been reported to restore function of damaged tissue in
various preclinical disease models [47,48], it follows that
combining stem cell therapy with gene therapy might provide
additive benefits. Indeed, we have reported that endothelial
progenitor cells engineered to overexpress endothelial NO
synthase were significantly more effective than endothelial
progenitor cells alone in a monocrotaline model of vascular
injury, producing near complete reversal of established
pulmonary hypertension [48].
The choice of the most appropriate therapeutic gene is a
critical determinant of the potential efficacy of a gene
therapy strategy, and requires a detailed understanding of
the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the target disorder.
ARDS is a complex clinical syndrome that is initiated by
injury to the lung, often in the setting of pneumonia or sepsis.
Some of the early features of ARDS can be reproduced by
administration of bacterial endotoxin (LPS), which acts via
TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) to induce the expression of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and up-regulate
leukocyte adhesion molecules, resulting in EC activation [5–
9,59]. Recently, it has been observed that activation of ECs in
response to inflammatory cytokines is tightly regulated by
ANGPT1. ANGPT1, the principal agonist of TEK, is an EC
survival and vascular stabilization factor that maintains
endothelial permeability in the normal postnatal vasculature
[39–42]. In contrast, ANGPT2, which binds with equal affinity,

has been described as a TEK antagonist, inhibiting receptor
activation in response to ANGPT1 [60]. Fiedler et al. showed
that ANGPT2 overexpression sensitized ECs to inflammatory
stimuli and potentiated the up-regulation of adhesion
molecules such as ICAM1 and VCAM1 in response to
suboptimal doses of TNF-a [61]. Circulating levels of
ANGPT2 were found to be elevated in the plasma of patients
suffering from sepsis, and the administration of ANGPT2 led
to disruption of endothelial barrier both in vitro and in a
mouse model in vivo [62]. Moreover, ANGPT2 expression was
recently observed to be increased in alveolar epithelial cells
in response to hyperoxia-induced ALI, whereas ANGPT1
expression was reduced [63].
Therefore, a therapeutic strategy to restore the balance
between ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 expression may be useful in
modulating endothelial activation and inflammation in
response to ALI. Systemic pretreatment with an adenoviral
construct containing ANGPT1 by Witzenbichler et al. was
reported to improve hemodynamics, reduce adhesion mole￾cule expression and prolong survival in mice with endotoxic
shock [64]. Similarly, we have shown that fibroblasts trans￾fected with ANGPT1 were moderately effective in reducing
ALI in rats when given one day prior to LPS, attenuating
airspace inflammation by 60% and reducing expression of
endothelial-selective adhesion molecules [65]. However, in
these studies gene transfer was performed prior to lung

injury, and it is uncertain whether post-treatment strategies,
which are more relevant for clinical therapy, would have been
equally effective. Furthermore, the Witzenbichler study used
intraperitoneal administration of endotoxin and systemic
gene therapy [64], and it is not possible to differentiate local
actions of ANGPT1 on lung inflammation from its actions in
the peripheral circulation.
The observed therapeutic effect of MSCs alone in ALI was
not entirely unexpected, since previous reports have sug￾gested that MSCs can inhibit the activation of dendritic cells,
T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, reducing the secretion
of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-a, IFN-c), increasing the
release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL10, IL4), and
inducing a tolerant phenotype [66,67]. The immunomodula￾tory effects of MSCs have been studied in a number of
inflammatory states such as graft-versus-host disease [68] and
autoimmune encephalomyelitis [69]. It has also been sug￾gested that the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs, together
with their lack of expression of class II major histocompat￾ibility complex antigens, may confer an ‘‘immune-privileged’’
state in the context of allogenic transplantation, which could
greatly simplify their therapeutic use. Indeed, in early clinical
trials, the use of cultured allogenic MSCs was shown to be well
tolerated, and did not induce a detectable immune response
when transplanted into an unrelated recipient [30,70].
In the present study, there was an additional effect of
ANGPT1 overexpressing MSCs compared with MSCs alone,
not only on the extravasation of plasma proteins and
inflammatory cells, but also on the levels of various
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the BAL fluid.
Interestingly, this additive effect was not apparent when these
mediators were measured in whole-lung homogenates.
ANGPT1 acts on TEK receptors, which are largely restricted
to the endothelium. Thus, it is likely that ANGPT1 would have
a preferential effect on the vascular endothelium, reducing
inflammatory cell trafficking and plasma protein exudation
into the alveolar space, and possibly inhibiting EC apoptosis
as well. In contrast, effects of LPS on the airway epithelium or
resident alveolar macrophages may not be directly modulated
by ANGPT1. However, it should be noted that MSCs alone
resulted in a near complete reduction of tissue cytokine
expression, with the exception of Cxcl2, which in fact was
further reduced in the group receiving with pANGPT1-
transfected MSCs. It is also of interest that near complete
normalization of protein and inflammatory cell exudation
into the alveolus after intratracheal LPS instillation was
achieved with MSCs-pANGPT1 delivered to the pulmonary
circulation, despite the fact that alveolar permeability is
determined by the functional integrity of both the alveolar
epithelium and the alveolar endothelium, which together
constitute the alveolar–capillary membrane barrier of the
lung [1]. It has been well documented that LPS-induced ALI is
associated with up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the
endothelial surface [71]. Leukocyte adhesion to the activated
endothelium is a critical determinant of the alveolar
inflammatory response, leading to transmigration of inflam￾matory cells into the airspace and possible exacerbation of
epithelial injury and increased pulmonary vascular leak [71].
Thus, the synergistic effect of ANGPT1 gene transfer may be
attributed to its ability to reduce EC activation and thus block
the amplification of lung injury that is dependent on the

recruitment of leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation
into the injured lung.
On a separate note, we were unable to detect a significant
increase in human ANGPT1 proteins in the lung tissue, BAL
fluid, or plasma (unpublished data) after injection of
pANGPT1-transfected MSCs. We believe that this is due to
the lack of specific antibodies to human ANGPT1 that can
reliably detect the human ANGPT1 transgene product above
the ‘‘noise’’ of the endogenous mouse proteins. In a separate
study in which mice were allowed to survive up to 2 wk, a 20%
mortality (up to 9 d) was observed in the LPS/saline group. No
animals died in either the LPS/MSCs group or the LPS/MSCs￾Figure 6. Retention of Injected MSCs in Mice With or Without LPS-Induced ALI

pANGPT1 group (unpublished data). We have also examined
the effect of MSCs and MSCs-pANGPT1 at earlier time points
(unpublished data). There was no difference in the total cell
counts in BAL fluid in LPS-injured mice that received
treatment with either MSCs or MSCs-pANGPT1, compared
to the LPS/saline group (1 d after LPS injury). However, 2 d
after LPS injury and treatment, there was a significant
decrease in the total cell count in BAL fluid from mice that
received MSCs and MSCs-pANGPT1 compared to controls,
though the difference between those two groups was not
significant. Preliminary data measuring the systemic level of
IL1b suggested that plasma IL1b level peaked in LPS-injured
mice (1 d after LPS) without treatment (LPS/saline mice),
while most mice that had received treatment (LPS/MSCs or
LPS/MSCs-pANGPT1) had lower or undetectable levels.
Plasma IL1b rapidly declined in LPS-injured mice 2 d after
injury. Mice that had received treatment (MSCs or MSCs￾pANGPT1) had lower or undetectable levels.
We also examined whether the observed therapeutic effects
depended on the retention of MSCs. A slightly higher
proportion of cells were retained in injured lungs 15 minutes
after LPS exposure; however, the difference between injured
versus uninjured lung was not significant, and in both cases
the majority of cells were lost from the lung by 3 d. Our
results are in agreement with those of Beckett et al., who
reported no significant improvement in lung engraftment of
bone marrow-derived cells following endotoxin- or NO2-
induced lung injury together with irradiation [72]. However,
other studies have reported greater cell persistence after
certain forms of injury [26,73–75]. Nonetheless, it is clear that
the benefit seen in response to cell-based therapy in the LPS
injury model did not require a high level of long-term
persistence of transplanted MSCs. This observation is con￾sistent with a number of reports of bone marrow cell therapy
following myocardial infarction [76,77], which point to an
important role for paracrine actions of transplanted cells on
neovascularization and tissue healing. However, the precise
mechanism by which genetically engineered MSCs confer a
therapeutic benefit in the model of ALI remains to be
determined.
Study Limitations
It is important to recognize certain limitations of this
study. First of all, the LPS-induced model of ALI cannot fully
reproduce the complexity of clinical ALI/ARDS in human
patients. Therefore, it will be necessary to reproduce these
findings in more clinically relevant models, such as in animal
models of sepsis and pneumonia. As well, cell therapy was
given only 30 min after lung injury, and it will be important
to define the therapeutic window of this intervention at later
time points. Moreover, percentages of the retained cells in
the lung after transplantation were fairly low, and future
studies need to address the question of whether higher levels
of MSCs incorporation would provide more therapeutic
benefit in this and other models of ALI. A further limitation
relates to the use syngeneic cells for cell therapy in the
current study, which avoids the issue of host immune
response. However, given the growing literature that these
MSCs may be ‘‘immune-privileged,’’ it will be important in
future work to explore whether the use of allogenic MSCs will
have the same beneficial effects in this ALI model. The
translation of these promising results into an effective new
therapy for ARDS in patients will require, at the very least,
that these limitations be addressed.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that bone marrow-derived
MSCs reduced the severity of ALI when administered into the
pulmonary circulation of the LPS-injured mouse lung,
possibly by virtue of their well-characterized immunomodu￾latory actions. However, this effect was greatly potentiated
when these cells were engineered to overexpress the
vasculoprotective factor ANGPT1, a specific inhibitor of
inflammation and permeability in ECs. Our data show, to our
knowledge for the first time, the synergistic action of
combined cell and gene therapy for ALI, and may provide a
basis for the development of an innovative approach for the
prevention and treatment of ARDS, which continues to be a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill
patients.

Editors’ Summary
Background. Critically ill people who have had an injury to their lungs,
for example through pneumonia, trauma, or an immune response to
infection, may end up developing a serious complication in the lung
termed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS, inflamma￾tion develops in the lung, and fluid builds up in the alveoli (the air sacs
resembling ‘‘bunches of grapes’’ at the ends of the network of tubes in
the lung). This buildup of fluid prevents oxygen from being carried
efficiently from air into the blood; the individual consequently
experiences problems breathing and can develop further serious
complications, which contribute significantly to the burden of illness
among people in intensive care units. The death rate among individuals
who do develop ARDS is very high, upward of 30%. Normally, individuals
with ARDS are given extra oxygen, and may need a machine to help
them breathe; treatments also focus on addressing the underlying
causes in each particular patient. However, currently there are very few
specific treatments that address ARDS itself.
Why Was This Study Done? The researchers here wanted to work
toward new treatment options for individuals with ARDS. One possible
approach involves cells known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These
cells are typically found in the bone marrow and have a property shared
by very few other cell types in the body; they are able to carry on
dividing and renewing themselves, and can eventually develop into
many other types of cell. The researchers already knew that MSCs could
become incorporated into injured lungs in mice and develop there into
the tissue layers lining the lung. Some interesting work had also been
done on a protein called angiopoeitin 1 (ANGPT1), which seemed to play
a role in protecting against inflammation in blood vessels. Therefore,
there was a strong rationale for carrying out experiments in mice to see if
MSCs engineered to produce the ANGPT1 protein might ‘‘rescue’’ lung
injury in mice. These experiments would be an initial step toward
developing possible new treatments for humans with ARDS.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers used a mouse
model to mimic the human ARDS condition. This involved injecting the
windpipe of experimental mice with lipopolysaccharide (a substance
normally found on the outer surface of bacteria that brings about an
immune reaction in the lung). After 30 minutes, the mice were then
injected with either salt solution (as a control), the MSCs, or MSCs
producing the ANGPT1 protein. The researchers then looked at markers
of lung inflammation, the appearance of the lungs under a microscope,
and whether the injected MSCs had become incorporated into the lung
tissue.
The lipopolysaccharide brought about a large increase in the number of
inflammatory cells in the lung fluid, which was reduced in the mice given
MSCs. Furthermore, in mice given the MSCs producing ANGPT1 protein,
the number of inflammatory cells was reduced to a level similar to that of
mice that had not been given lipopolysaccharide. When the researchers
looked at the appearance under the microscope of lungs from mice that
had been given lipopolysaccharide, they saw signs of inflammation and
fluid coming out into the lung air spaces. These signs were reduced
among both mice treated with MSCs and those treated with MSCs
producing ANGPT1. The researchers also measured the ‘‘leakiness’’ of
the lung tissues in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice; MSCs seemed to
reduce the leakiness to some extent, and the lungs of mice treated with
MSCs producing ANGPT1 were no more leaky than those of mice that
had never been injected with lipopolysaccharide. Finally, the MSCs were
seen to be incorporated into lung tissue by three days after injection, but
after that were lost from the lung.
What Do These Findings Mean? Previous research done by the same
group had shown that fibroblasts producing ANGPT1 could prevent lung
injury in rats later given lipopolysaccharide. The experiments reported
here go a step further than this, and suggest that MSCs producing
ANGPT1 can ‘‘rescue’’ the condition of mouse lungs that had already
been given lipopolysaccharide. In addition, treatment with MSCs alone
also produced beneficial effects. This opens up a possible new treatment
strategy for ARDS in humans. However, it should be emphasized that the
animal model used here is not a precise parallel of ARDS in humans, and
that more research remains to be done before human studies of this sort
could be considered.
