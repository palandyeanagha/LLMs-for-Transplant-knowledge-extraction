Hepatic stellate cells are liver-specific mesenchymal cells that play vital roles in liver physiology and fibrogene￾sis. They are located in the space of Disse and maintain close interactions with sinusoidal endothelial cells and 
hepatic epithelial cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that hepatic stellate cells have a profound impact on 
the differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis of other hepatic cell types during liver development and 
regeneration. In this Review, we summarize and evaluate the recent advances in our understanding of the forma￾tion and characteristics of hepatic stellate cells, as well as their function in liver development, regeneration, and 
cancer. We also discuss how improved knowledge of these processes offers new perspectives for the treatment of 
patients with liver diseases.
Hepatic stellate cells are located in the space of Disse between 
the sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic epithelial cells, and 
account for 5%–8% of the cells in the liver. In a healthy liver, 
stellate cells are quiescent and contain numerous vitamin A 
lipid droplets, constituting the largest reservoir of vitamin A 
in the body (reviewed in ref. 1). When the liver is injured due 
to viral infection or hepatic toxins, hepatic stellate cells receive 
signals secreted by damaged hepatocytes and immune cells, 
causing them to transdifferentiate into activated myofibroblast￾like cells (reviewed in ref. 2). As the primary extracellular matrix–
producing (ECM-producing) cells in liver, activated stellate cells 
generate a temporary scar at the site of injury to protect the liver 
from further damage. In addition, hepatic stellate cells secrete 
cytokines and growth factors that promote the regeneration of 
hepatic epithelial cells. In chronic liver disease, prolonged and 
repeated activation of stellate cells causes liver fibrosis, as char￾acterized by widespread scar formation and perturbation of 
liver architecture and function (reviewed in ref. 3). Recent clin￾ical and experimental evidence indicates that hepatic fibrosis 
is reversible upon removal of the underlying etiological agent 
(4–6). During the regression of liver fibrosis, the number of 
activated hepatic stellate cells is greatly reduced by the induc￾tion of cellular senescence and apoptosis, or by the return to 
the quiescent state (2, 5–7). Because of their pivotal roles in liver 
repair and disease pathogenesis, hepatic stellate cells have been 
a major focus of liver research. However, our knowledge of their 
cell biology is far from complete, mainly due to the challenges 
of studying these cells in vivo.
This Review focuses on the recent insights and emerging inves￾tigations into the formation of hepatic stellate cells and their 
function in liver development, regeneration, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). The regulation of stellate cells in liver fibrosis 
as well as the design of antifibrotic therapies is reviewed sepa￾rately in this issue (8).
Experimental models to study hepatic stellate cells
Over the past two decades, the development of cell culture system 
and genetic animal models (summarized in Figure 1) has greatly 
advanced our understanding of the cellular properties of hepatic 
stellate cells and their function in healthy as well as injured livers. 
When cultured on plastic, freshly isolated hepatic stellate cells 
undergo spontaneous activation (9–11). This cell culture sys￾tem, along with other hepatic stellate cell lines (12–14), recapit￾ulates many aspects of hepatic stellate cell activation in vivo. But 
hepatic stellate cells activated in culture do not fully reproduce 
the changes in gene expression observed in vivo, making it diffi￾cult in some cases to correlate in vitro results with hepatic stellate 
cell behaviors in vivo (15).
In the animal, hepatic stellate cells can be identified based on 
expression of desmin (16) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
(17) in the quiescent state and α-SMA in the activated state (18). 
The identification of promoters that selectively drive transgene 
expression in hepatic stellate cells might facilitate both in vivo 
observations and genetic manipulation of these cells. Components 
of collagen α1(I), collagen α2(I), and αSMA promoters were used 
to direct reporter gene expression in activated hepatic stellate cells 
in transgenic mice (19). Promoter elements of the Gfap (20, 21) and 
vimentin (6) genes drive gene expression in quiescent hepatic stel￾late cells. However, neither promoter is specific for hepatic stellate 
cells: Gfap promoter activity is detected in neuronal tissues and 
cholangiocytes (21), whereas the vimentin gene is also expressed in 
vascular smooth muscle cells and portal fibroblasts (6).
The zebrafish has emerged as a valuable vertebrate model sys￾tem to study liver development and disease. The rapid external 
development and translucence of zebrafish embryos and larvae 
make them well suited for in vivo imaging (22, 23). The availabil￾ity of transgenic lines that express fluorescent proteins in differ￾ent hepatic cell types allows easy visualization of cell behaviors 
in the animal and greatly facilitates genetic and chemical screens 
to identify regulators of liver development and disease patho￾genesis. Our group recently reported a transgenic zebrafish line, 
Tg(hand2:EGFP), that expresses EGFP under the promoter of the 
hand2 gene (24). The transgene expression marks both quiescent 
and activated hepatic stellate cells. Zebrafish hepatic stellate cells

exhibit all the hallmarks of mammalian hepatic stellate cells, 
including morphology, localization, vitamin A storage, and gene 
expression profile. Significantly, zebrafish hepatic stellate cells 
become activated in response to an acute alcohol insult, as evi￾denced by increased proliferation and ECM production (Figure 1 
and ref. 24). This zebrafish hepatic stellate cell reporter line thus 
represents a novel animal model that complements the cell culture 
and mammalian model systems.
Hepatic stellate cells in liver development
Knowledge about the characteristics, lineage, and function of 
stellate cells during liver development is critical to obtaining a 
fundamental understanding of hepatic stellate cell activation and 
their role in liver diseases. Recent studies in animal models and 
cell culture systems have provided key insights regarding hepatic 
stellate cells during development, but important gaps remain in 
our knowledge of this process.
Embryonic origin of hepatic stellate cells. The embryonic origin of 
hepatic stellate cells is unresolved because they express marker 
genes of all three germ layers (reviewed in ref. 2). Lineage tracing 
of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene–expressing (Wt1-express￾ing) cells and mesoderm posterior 1–expressing cells in mice 
showed that hepatic stellate cells develop from the septum trans￾versum–derived mesothelium lining the liver (25, 26), suggestive 
of a mesodermal origin. On the other hand, stellate cells in the 
human fetal liver express CD34 and cytokeratin-7/8, connecting 
them to an endodermal origin (27, 28). Along this theme, hepatic 
epithelial cells are thought to transdifferentiate into hepatic 
stellate cells in the injured liver through epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) (29). However, the contribution of EMT to the 
hepatic stellate cell lineage is highly controversial (30). Lastly, 
bone marrow–derived mesenchymal cells are also thought to 
contribute to both quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells 
(31, 32), although several reports indicate that this contribution 
is negligible (33, 34).
It is noteworthy that in mice, the septum transversum-derived 
mesothelial cells give rise not only to hepatic stellate cells, but also 
to perivascular mesenchymal cells, including portal fibroblasts, 
smooth muscle cells around the portal vein, and fibroblasts around 
the central vein (26). Following liver injury, activated stellate cells 
are the major source of myofibroblasts. However, portal fibrob￾lasts and vascular myofibroblasts can also become myofibroblasts, 
but their contribution to fibrogenesis might be different from the 
hepatic stellate cell–derived myofibroblasts (35, 36). Therefore, 
an understanding of how the cell fate decision is made between 
hepatic stellate cells and perivascular mesenchymal cells might aid 
in the design of therapies to specifically target hepatic stellate cells.
In both fetal and adult livers, stellate cells are closely associ￾ated with sinusoidal endothelial cells, which also derive from 
mesoderm. Because of their physical proximity and shared expres￾sion of angiogenic factors (37), hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal 
endothelial cells have been proposed to share a common precur￾sor. This hypothesis is supported by observations in chick embryos 
that the mesothelium contributes to both cell populations (38). In 
zebrafish, however, stellate cells are still present in the liver of cloche
mutants that lack sinusoidal endothelial cells and their precursors 
(24). This result indicates that neither endothelial cells nor their 
precursors are required for hepatic stellate cell differentiation or 
their entry into the liver.
Regulation of hepatic stellate cell development. To date, only a few 
studies have addressed early hepatic stellate cell behaviors in vivo. 
Tracking of the Wt1-expressing septum transversum cells in mice 
showed that these cells migrate inward from the liver surface while 
differentiating into hepatic stellate cells (ref. 25 and see Figure 2A). 
A similar migration behavior of hepatic stellate cells was observed 
in zebrafish (24). Furthermore, the migration of septum transver￾sum cells from the liver surface likely constitutes the main source 
of new stellate cells during zebrafish development, as they rarely 
proliferate after entering the liver.
Studies in mutant mice have revealed the roles of several mes￾enchymal-specific genes in hepatic stellate cell development (sum￾marized in Figure 2A). Wt1 and the LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 are

of complex cellular processes and elongated cell body, suggestive of 
changes in contractility (24).

both expressed in the septum transversum and hepatic stellate cells 
during development (26, 39). Wt1-null fetal livers show an abnormal 
increase of α-SMA expression (40), suggestive of ectopic stellate cell 
activation. Similarly, Lhx2 knockout embryos contain numerous 
activated hepatic stellate cells and display a progressively increased 
deposition of ECM proteins associated with fibrosis (41). Therefore, 
despite being dispensable for hepatic stellate cell formation, both 
Wt1 and Lhx2 appear to keep these cells quiescent during develop￾ment. The signal downstream of Wt1 and Lhx2 that prevents hepatic 
stellate cell activation is unclear. One candidate is the Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway, as conditional deletion of β-catenin in the mesenchyme 
results in increased α-SMA expression and ECM deposition in the 
liver (42, 43). On the other hand, freshly isolated hepatic stellate cells 
from adult mice exhibit hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity, and inhi￾bition of Hh signaling via pharmacologic inhibitor or neutralizing 
antibodies to Hh impairs hepatic stellate cell activation and decreases 
their survival (44). It will be interesting to investigate the role of the 
Hh pathway during the development of hepatic stellate cells.
Studies of the zebrafish hepatic stellate cell reporter line have 
shed light on the regulation of their differentiation and migration 
into the liver. Inhibition of VEGF signaling by global knockdown of 
VEGFR2 or by treatment with a VEGFR2 pharmacologic inhibitor 
during the course of hepatic stellate cell differentiation and migra￾tion drastically reduces their numbers (24). VEGF signaling does 
not appear to be essential for hepatic stellate cell survival, as block￾ing VEGFR2 during later stages only caused a moderate decrease 
in hepatic stellate cell numbers. Rather, VEGF may be required for 
hepatic stellate cell differentiation and/or their entry into the liver. 
Studies of liver injury and cancer have documented VEGF ligand 
expression by hepatocytes and biliary cells (45–47). Likewise, 
hepatic epithelial cells could be the source of VEGF for hepatic stel￾late cell development. Using an unbiased chemical screen approach, 
our group discovered two retinoid receptor agonists that have an 
opposing effect on hepatic stellate cell development (24). Com￾pounds that modulate stellate cell differentiation, proliferation, 
or the switch between their quiescent and activated states during

Hepatic stellate cell development and contribution to liver organogenesis. (A) Hepatic stellate cell development. Lineage-tracing analyses in mice 
indicate that during development, the mesodermal cells within the septum transversum invade the liver while differentiating into hepatic stellate 
cells and perivascular mesenchymal cells. VEGF and retinoic acid signaling are both required for hepatic stellate cell formation, potentially affect￾ing the migration of septum transversum cells, the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells, or both. Wt1, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and Lhx2 inhibit 
aberrant activation of hepatic stellate cells in the developing liver. (B) Contribution of hepatic stellate cells to hepatic organogenesis. The biolog￾ical processes influenced by hepatic stellate cells are indicated in blue. For endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells secrete the chemokine SDF1, 
whereas endothelial cells express its receptor CXCR4. Concurrently, endothelial cells produce PDGFβ, whereas hepatic stellate cells express 
its receptor. SDF1α and PDGFβ signaling maintain the close association between hepatic stellate cells and endothelial cells, which is critical for 
vascular tube formation and integrity. For hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), hepatic stellate cells mediate their recruitment to the liver via SDF1α/
CXCR4 signaling. For hepatic epithelial cells, hepatic stellate cells regulate the proliferation of hepatoblast progenitor cells and hepatocytes by 
producing growth factors such as Wnt, FGF, HGF, and retinoic acid. They may also modulate the differentiation of hepatocytes and biliary cells 
from hepatoblasts by controlling the ECM composition within the liver. Lastly, hepatic stellate cells may contribute to the development of biliary 
cells by expressing the Notch ligand jagged 1 (Jag1).

development could potentially affect hepatic stellate cell behavior 
during injury, and thus have direct clinical implications.
The contribution of hepatic stellate cell to hepatic organogenesis. 
Throughout development, hepatic stellate cells are in close prox￾imity to endothelial, hematopoietic, and hepatic epithelial cells, 
which suggests that hepatic stellate cells may modulate the 
growth, differentiation, or morphogenesis of these cells (sum￾marized in Figure 2B). The interactions between stellate cells and 
other hepatic cells during development could be reactivated when 
the liver responds to injury.
Hepatic stellate cells contact sinusoidal endothelial cells by means 
of complex cytoplasmic processes, which ideally positions them for 
paracrine signaling with endothelial cells (48). During angiogenesis, 
interactions between pericytes and endothelial cells are essential for 
vascular tube maturation and integrity (49). Hepatic stellate cells are 
thought to be the pericyte equivalent in the liver and therefore may 
have the same impact on the development of the hepatic vasculature 
(50). In support of this notion, in mice that lack β-catenin in the 
liver mesenchyme, hepatic stellate cells become aberrantly activated 
and the liver is filled with dilated sinusoids (42).
During mammalian embryogenesis, the liver is the main site 
of hematopoiesis (51). In mice lacking the hepatic stellate cell–
expressing homeobox gene Hlx, fetal liver hematopoiesis is severely 
impaired (52), implicating hepatic stellate cells in this process. 
Fetal hepatic stellate cells express stromal cell–derived factor 1α
(SDF1α; also known as CXCL12) (51), a potent chemoattractant 
for hematopoietic stem cells, which themselves express the SDF1α
receptor CXCR4 (53). Therefore, it is plausible that hepatic stel￾late cells are involved in recruiting hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells into the fetal liver.
Stellate cells first appear in mouse livers at around E10–E11, 
when differentiation of hepatocytes and biliary cells from hepa￾toblasts is still underway (54). Mouse fetal liver mesenchymal cells 
promote the maturation of hepatoblasts through cell-cell contact 
in cell culture (55). In Wt1 and Hlx mutant mice, the hepatoblast 
population fails to proliferate, resulting in smaller livers (40, 52). 
Fetal hepatic stellate cells express growth factors and mitogens such 
as Wnt9a (56), HGF (57), pleiotrophin (58), and FGF10 (59, 60), 
all of which have profound effects on the proliferation of hepatic 
epithelial cells during organ development and regeneration. In 
Figure 3
Hepatic stellate cells in liver regeneration and HCC. The biological processes that are influenced by hepatic stellate cells are indicated in blue. 
At early phases of liver regeneration, hepatic stellate cells promote the proliferation of liver progenitor cells and hepatocytes. They also stimulate 
angiogenesis in the wounded area and assist in the recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells and immune cells to the liver (reviewed in ref. 48). 
Recent studies suggest that activated hepatic stellate cells may undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to transdifferentiate into liver 
progenitor cells. At late phases, hepatic stellate cells participate in the termination of regeneration, likely via high expression of TGF-β. Hepatic 
stellate cells have also been proposed to contribute to HCC development, potentially through dysregulation of some aspects of liver regeneration 
described above. On the other hand, liver fibrosis, which results from ectopic hepatic stellate cell activation, has controversial roles in HCC. Most 
evidence suggests that fibrosis promotes HCC, but it is possible that in some clinical settings fibrosis and HCC might occur due to the same 
underlying factor(s) rather than one promoting the other.

addition, hepatic stellate cells in the Wt1-null fetal livers show 
decreased expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme 
that catalyzes retinoic acid synthesis (40). The impairment of 
retinoic acid production could in turn affect hepatoblast pro￾liferation. The role of hepatic stellate cells in hepatoblast differ￾entiation is less clear. Nagai et al. reported that cell-cell contacts 
between hepatic stellate cells and hepatic epithelial cells induce 
the differentiation of the hepatocyte fate (61). On the other hand, 
the emergence and distribution of hepatic stellate cells also seem 
to correlate with the development of intrahepatic biliary cells 
(62). Hepatic stellate cells in rats express Notch receptors and tar￾get genes of Notch signaling (63), and Notch signaling plays key 
roles in the differentiation and morphogenesis of intrahepatic 
biliary cells (64). A recent study showed that inactivation of the 
Notch ligand jagged 1, which is expressed in the portal vein mes￾enchyme, leads to a paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts (65). Given 
that hepatic stellate cells also express jagged 1 (66), it will be inter￾esting to investigate whether they modulate biliary cell develop￾ment via Notch signaling. Alternatively, hepatic stellate cells could 
influence hepatoblast differentiation through production of ECM 
proteins, as different ECM components have different effects on 
the determination of the hepatocyte and biliary cell fate (67, 68).
The directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells 
into hepatocytes in culture could lead to new cell transplanta￾tion therapies for a wide range of acute and chronic liver diseases. 
Although important progress toward this goal has been made in 
recent years, liver cells differentiated in vitro do not share all the 
key characteristics of mature hepatocytes (reviewed in refs. 69, 70). 
Co-culturing primary human liver progenitor cells or hepatocytes 
with mesenchymal cells promotes or stabilizes hepatocyte dif￾ferentiation (71–73). Therefore, understanding the interactions 
between hepatic stellate cells and hepatic epithelial cells during 
development is essential to create more efficient cell culture proto￾cols for programmed differentiation of stem cells into hepatocytes.
Hepatic stellate cells in liver regeneration
Much as studies of liver development are highly relevant to creat￾ing new stem cell therapies, an understanding of liver regenera￾tion has important implications for improving current methods 
of differentiating and propagating hepatocytes in vitro, as well 
as for stimulating hepatic recovery and improving survival after 
acute liver failure, liver transplantation, or resection. One of the 
oldest and most commonly used rodent models of liver regener￾ation is partial hepatectomy (PH), in which two-thirds of the ani￾mal’s liver is surgically removed (74, 75). Liver regeneration fol￾lowing PH is mainly driven by replication of existing hepatocytes 
and occurs in the absence of substantial necrosis and inflamma￾tion (74). To model how the liver regenerates when the ability of 
hepatocytes to divide is compromised, hepatocyte proliferation 
inhibitors such as 2-acetylaminofluorene can be administered 
before PH (2AAF/PH), which results in liver repopulation medi￾ated by activation of liver progenitor cells or oval cells rather 
than proliferation of hepatocytes (74). Other rodent models of 
liver injury and regeneration involve chemical treatments with 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or acetaminophen (reviewed in ref. 
76) or bile duct ligation (BDL) (77). While the PH model of liver 
regeneration may be particularly relevant to clinical scenarios 
in which the quantity of liver tissue is a limiting factor, such as 
small-for-size syndrome following liver transplantation, chemi￾cal injury and BDL models may more faithfully recapitulate the 
necrosis, inflammation, and/or fibrosis that accompany regen￾eration in chronic viral hepatitis, biliary tract disease, and/or 
drug-induced liver injury.
Activated hepatic stellate cells have been implicated in assisting 
liver regeneration by producing angiogenic factors as well as fac￾tors that modulate endothelial cell and hepatocyte proliferation 
and by remodeling the ECM (78). Recent evidence also suggests 
that in progenitor cell-mediated liver regeneration, hepatic stellate 
cells may, through a process of mesenchymal to epithelial tran￾sition, give rise to hepatocytes (21). Supporting the involvement 
of stellate cells in liver regeneration, inhibiting activated hepatic 
stellate cells using gliotoxin (79) and l-cysteine (80) prevents nor￾mal regenerative responses of both hepatocytes and oval cells in 
acetaminophen and 2AAF/PH-induced liver injuries, respectively. 
In addition, Foxf1+/– mice subjected to CCl4 injury show decreased 
hepatic stellate cell activation and more severe hepatocyte necro￾sis during the regenerative period (81). Notably, the mechanisms 
by which activated hepatic stellate cells help mediate liver regen￾eration in human patients and experimental animals remain to 
be determined and the relative importance of different subtypes 
of hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts is likely to depend on the 
nature of the initial insult.
Activated hepatic stellate cells produce a wide array of cytokines 
and chemokines (2). These factors may directly enhance the pro￾liferation of liver progenitor cells and hepatocytes, or they may act 
indirectly through sinusoidal endothelial cells and immune cells 
to promote regeneration (ref. 2 and summarized in Figure 3). Con￾ditioned media collected from hepatic stellate cells harvested from 
rats during early liver regeneration following 2AAF/PH injury con￾tain high levels of HGF and promote oval cell proliferation (82). 
One potential mediator of HGF production by hepatic stellate 
cells is the neurotrophin receptor P75NTR, which is expressed in 
human hepatic stellate cells following fibrotic liver injury. Murine 
hepatic stellate cells deficient for P75NTR do not differentiate prop￾erly into myofibroblasts in vitro or following liver injury induced 
by fibrin deposition in plasminogen-deficient (Plg–/–) mice (83). 
Consequently, HGF production and hepatocyte proliferation are 
impaired in P75NTR;Plg double-mutant mice (83). Hepatic stellate 
cell differentiation can be restored by constitutively active Rho in 
P75NTR-deficient hepatic stellate cells in vitro (83). These findings 
support a model in which P75NTR promotes hepatic stellate cell 
activation via Rho, and activated stellate cells secrete HGF to stim￾ulate hepatocyte proliferation during regeneration (83). Hh sig￾naling is another important mediator of hepatic stellate cell–hepa￾tocyte interactions during regeneration. Culture-activated hepatic 
stellate cells synthesize sonic hedgehog (Shh), which serves as an 
autocrine growth factor for these cells (84). In vivo, Hh ligands 
induce hepatocyte proliferation after PH (85).
Notably, activated hepatic stellate cells are the main source of 
matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors that participate 
in ECM remodeling. The production of cytokines and remodel￾ing of the ECM are likely to be coupled, as the ECM is capable of 
sequestering biologically active molecules (86, 87). Thus in addi￾tion to directly secreting cytokines, activated hepatic stellate cells 
may modulate their function by cleaving or releasing cytokines 
from the ECM.
Liver regeneration is a multistep process involving both initia￾tion and termination of liver growth. The liver stops regenerating 
when it attains the mass required for the needs of the organism 
(88). The most well-known hepatocyte antiproliferative factor is 

review series
The Journal of Clinical Investigation   http://www.jci.org   Volume 123   Number 5   May 2013 1907
TGF-β, and one of the primary TGF-β–producing cell types in 
the liver are hepatic stellate cells (89). How do hepatic stellate 
cells mediate both the initiation and cessation of liver regenera￾tion? As mentioned earlier, conditioned medium collected from 
hepatic stellate cells at early phases of liver regeneration in a 
2AAF/PH injury model contains high levels of HGF. This strong 
mitogen may override the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β1 (82). 
In contrast, at terminal phases of liver regeneration, hepatic stel￾late cells produce high levels of TGF-β1, which inhibits hepa￾tocyte proliferation and even induces apoptosis. Serotonin has 
been shown to increase expression of TGF-β1 in cultured pri￾mary mouse hepatic stellate cells via the 5-hydroxytryptamine 
2B (5-HT2B) receptor, and 5-HT2B inhibition promotes hepato￾cyte proliferation following PH, BDL, and CCl4-induced liver 
injury (90). Thus, hepatic stellate cells may change their cytokine 
expression profile during the process of liver regeneration, regu￾lating both its initiation and termination.
To fully characterize the role of hepatic stellate cells in liver 
regeneration, their specific ablation would be highly useful, ideally 
at different time points in the regenerative process. While some 
chemical tools, including gliotoxin (79) or l-cysteine (80), exist 
for selective inhibition of hepatic stellate cells in rodent models, 
the possibility that these drugs also affect other hepatic cell types 
is difficult to exclude. A recent study indicates that hepatic stel￾late cells can be depleted in mice by using the GFAP promoter to 
drive the herpes simplex virus–thymidine kinase gene expression, 
rendering proliferating hepatic stellate cells susceptible to gancy￾clovir-induced death (20). An advantage of this new model is the 
ability to target proliferating hepatic stellate cells in vivo without 
affecting quiescent hepatic stellate cells or other myofibroblasts. 
However, hepatic stellate cells cannot be completely ablated using 
this model, as GFAP is not universally expressed in these cells.
Any single animal model is unlikely to completely mimic all rele￾vant aspects of human liver regeneration, particularly given that the 
cellular and molecular pathways mediating regeneration are likely 
to vary somewhat depending on the nature of the initial injury. 
Therefore, future studies of hepatic stellate cells in liver regenera￾tion will be facilitated by the availability of multiple animal mod￾els, which are likely to yield complementary insights. Advantages 
of rodent models include the ability to isolate, culture, and activate 
hepatic stellate cells in vitro, facilitating follow-up cell culture stud￾ies focused on molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration. On 
the other hand, the excellent live-imaging technologies available in 
zebrafish are well suited for studying the cellular interactions at 
play during the regenerative process. As with rodents, PH or toxic 
chemicals can be used to induce liver regeneration in zebrafish 
(reviewed in ref. 74). Genetic tools have enabled the development 
of additional regeneration models including the nitroreductase/
metronidazole cell ablation system (91) and morpholino-based 
knockdown of a mitochondrial import gene to induce hepatocyte 
death (92). One promising approach is to perform high-through￾put chemical screens in various zebrafish models of liver injury, 
seeking drugs that affect stellate cells during liver regeneration (24).
Hepatic stellate cells in cancer
While promotion of hepatocyte proliferation and liver regenera￾tion may be desirable in some clinical settings, aberrant activation 
of such processes can also be associated with human diseases, most 
notably HCC (summarized in Figure 3). The majority of human 
HCCs occur in the setting of clinically significant fibrosis or cir￾rhosis (93), implicating hepatic stellate cells in their pathogenesis 
as the major ECM-producing cell type of the liver. The associa￾tions between HCC and fibrosis are incompletely understood, but 
likely involve inflammatory cells, integrin signaling, growth factor 
interactions with the ECM, and communication between activated 
hepatic stellate cells and tumor cells (reviewed in ref. 94). Activated 
hepatic stellate cells are present between endothelial cells and can￾cer cell trabeculae in patients with HCC (95), and conditioned 
media from activated hepatic stellate cells increases proliferation 
and migration of human HCC cells (96). Thus, most evidence sug￾gests that fibrosis promotes HCC, but it is possible that in some 
clinical settings fibrosis and HCC might occur due to the same 
underlying factor(s) rather than one promoting the other.
Chemical compounds such as N-nitrosodiethylamine, CCl4, and 
aflatoxin B1 cause HCC in rodents that is preceded by chronic liver 
injury, mimicking the injury-fibrosis-malignancy sequence that 
characterizes most human HCCs (97). However, tumor pheno￾types in these models are dependent on animal age, strain, and 
the route of drug administration, and tumor latency can be quite 
long (97). On the other hand, liver tumors induced genetically in 
mice via expression of growth factors such as TGF-α, oncogenes 
such as Myc, and viral proteins such as HBX are more tractable but 
are not usually preceded by substantial fibrosis (98, 99). Thus, the 
opportunity for studying hepatic stellate cell–HCC interactions 
in transgenic mouse models of HCC has been somewhat limited, 
with the notable exception of the PDGF-C transgenic mouse (100). 
These mice, whose hepatocytes express human PDGF-C, show 
hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen deposition followed 
by hepatomegaly and HCC. These in vivo findings correlate with 
in vitro studies demonstrating that PDGF-C promotes the prolif￾eration, survival, and migration of fibroblasts and pericytes (101).
Interactions between hepatic stellate cells and HCC cells in vivo 
have also been studied by co-transplanting hepatic stellate cells 
and malignant hepatocytes into immunocompromised mice. 
These studies have implicated TGF-β signaling (102, 103) and 
regulatory T cells (104) as mechanisms by which hepatic stellate 
cells may promote HCC growth. On the other hand, experiments 
performed in lecithin retinol acyltransferase–deficient mice have 
revealed ways by which HCC growth might be inhibited via tar￾geting of hepatic stellate cells (105, 106). These mice lack retinoid￾containing lipid droplets in hepatic stellate cells, exhibit increased 
retinoic acid signaling, and show decreased tumor formation in 
response to diethylnitrosamine, suggesting that altering retinoic 
acid signaling in stellate cells may inhibit HCC growth.
Zebrafish develop liver tumors that are morphologically and 
genetically similar to human HCC (107–110). Similar to many 
rodent models, zebrafish HCC models are not typically preceded by 
cirrhosis, although co-expression of hepatitis B virus X and hepatitis 
C virus core proteins in zebrafish liver leads to fibrosis and cholan￾giocarcinoma (111). This model may thus be useful to study hepatic 
stellate cell interactions with primary liver tumor cells in vivo.
While many pathways that mediate hepatic stellate cell–HCC 
interactions have been implicated (reviewed in ref. 94), the effects 
of specifically inhibiting or activating these pathways in vivo have 
not been fully explored. Driving expression of candidate positive 
or negative regulators specifically in hepatic stellate cells or cre￾ating stellate cell–specific gene knockouts could be useful in this 
regard. A major challenge for these experiments, as in studies of 
hepatic stellate cell development, is the identification of promot￾ers with improved specificity. Similarly, improved techniques for 

review series

ablating or inhibiting hepatic stellate cells could help tease out the 
role of these cells at different time points in HCC formation. Such 
studies could help define when and how hepatic stellate cells could 
be targeted to prevent or treat HCC.
A more efficient way to detect HCC could profoundly improve 
prognosis by enabling earlier diagnosis and more effective treat￾ments. New HCC biomarkers that have been proposed include 
molecules produced by hepatic stellate cells, such as HGF and 
IGF (112). Patients with HCC also show elevated plasma levels of 
TGF-β1 (113) and osteopontin (114), compared with patients with 
chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis. As many of the same factors 
are produced by hepatic stellate cells during cirrhosis and during 
carcinogenesis, it is likely that a combination of biomarkers will be 
required to optimize early HCC detection.
Conclusions
Studies of hepatic stellate cell behavior during development, 
regeneration, and tumor formation using cell culture and animal 
models have provided substantial insights regarding the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. It will be 
crucial to identify promoters with improved cell type specificity, 
as they will facilitate hepatic stellate cell–specific manipulations, 
including gene knockouts and cell ablation. Given the critical roles 
that hepatic stellate cells play in diverse aspects of liver pathophys￾iology, this intriguing cell type represents a major, and mostly 
untapped, potential reservoir for the development of therapies tar￾geting a wide variety of human liver diseases, ranging from acute 
liver failure to drug-induced liver injury to HCC.
